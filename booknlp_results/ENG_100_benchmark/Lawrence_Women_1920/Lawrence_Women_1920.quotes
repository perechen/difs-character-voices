79	89	77	77	Gudrun	352	' do n't you REALLY WANT to get married ? '
108	114	115	115	she	352	' I do n't know , '
118	125	115	115	she	352	' It depends how you mean . '
140	143	144	144	she	352	' Well , '
149	167	168	168	she	352	' it usually means one thing ! But do n't you think anyhow , you 'd be - '
172	183	168	168	she	352	' in a better position than you are in now . '
192	196	197	197	she	352	' I might , '

222	236	237	237	she	352	' You do n't think one needs the EXPERIENCE of having been married ? '
240	250	252	252	Ursula	264	' Do you think it need BE an experience ? '
254	265	267	267	Gudrun	352	' Bound to be , in some way or other , '
271	285	267	267	Gudrun	352	' Possibly undesirable , but bound to be an experience of some sort . '
286	290	292	292	Ursula	264	' Not really , '
294	304	292	292	Ursula	264	' More likely to be the end of experience . '
315	319	320	320	she	352	' Of course , '
323	330	320	320	she	352	' there 's THAT to consider . '
362	371	373	373	Gudrun	352	' You would n't consider a good offer ? '
375	383	385	385	Ursula	264	' I think I 've rejected several , '
387	390	391	391	Gudrun	352	' REALLY ! '
395	406	391	391	Gudrun	352	' But anything really worth while ? Have you REALLY ? '
407	424	426	426	Ursula	264	' A thousand a year , and an awfully nice man . I liked him awfully , '
428	438	391	391	Gudrun	352	' Really ! But were n't you fearfully tempted ? '
439	449	451	451	Ursula	264	' In the abstract but not in the concrete , '
453	482	451	451	Ursula	264	' When it comes to the point , one is n't even tempted - oh , if I were tempted , I 'd marry like a shot . I 'm
488	499	391	391	Gudrun	352	' The faces of both sisters suddenly lit up with amusement .
500	508	510	510	Gudrun	352	' Is n't it an amazing thing , '
512	522	510	510	Gudrun	352	' how strong the temptation is , not to ! '
675	682	683	683	She	352	' She is a smart woman . '
715	727	728	728	Gudrun	352	' I was hoping now for a man to come along , '
756	767	768	768	she	352	' So you have come home , expecting him here ? '
771	776	778	778	Gudrun	352	' Oh my dear , '
782	814	815	815	she	352	' I would n't go out of my way to look for him . But if there did happen to come along a highly attractive individual of sufficient means - well - '
833	842	843	843	she	352	' Do n't you find yourself getting bored ? '
849	870	821	821	she	352	' Do n't you find , that things fail to materialise ? NOTHING MATERIALISES ! Everything withers in the bud . '
871	878	880	880	Ursula	264	' What withers in the bud ? '
882	893	880	880	Ursula	264	' Oh , everything - oneself - things in general . '
907	913	915	915	Ursula	264	' It does frighten one , '
924	936	915	915	Ursula	264	' But do you hope to get anywhere by just marrying ? '
937	947	949	949	Gudrun	352	' It seems to be the inevitable next step , '
981	985	986	986	she	484	' I know , '
989	1033	986	986	she	484	' it seems like that when one thinks in the abstract . But really imagine it : imagine any man one knows , imagine him coming home to one every evening , and saying " Hello , " and giving one a kiss - '
1040	1043	1045	1045	Gudrun	352	' Yes , '
1052	1064	1045	1045	Gudrun	352	' It 's just impossible . The man makes it impossible . '
1065	1072	1074	1074	Ursula	264	' Of course there 's children - '
1082	1091	1092	1092	she	352	' Do you REALLY want children , Ursula ? '
1107	1116	1117	1117	she	484	' One feels it is still beyond one , '
1120	1127	1129	1129	Gudrun	352	' DO you feel like that ? '
1131	1144	1129	1129	Gudrun	352	' I get no feeling whatever from the thought of bearing children . '
1161	1168	1169	1169	she	484	' Perhaps it is n't genuine , '
1172	1189	1169	1169	she	484	' Perhaps one does n't really want them , in one 's soul - only superficially . '
1207	1217	1219	1219	Ursula	264	' When one thinks of other people 's children - '
1231	1234	1235	1235	she	352	' Exactly , '
1443	1452	1453	1453	she	352	' Why did you come home , Prune ? '
1482	1491	1492	1492	she	352	' Why did I come back , Ursula ? '
1495	1504	1492	1492	she	352	' I have asked myself a thousand times . '
1505	1512	1463	1463	She	352	' And do n't you know ? '
1513	1534	1492	1492	she	352	' Yes , I think I do . I think my coming back home was just RECULER POUR MIEUX SAUTER . '
1549	1553	1555	1555	Ursula	264	' I know ! '
1571	1579	1555	1555	Ursula	264	' But where can one jump to ? '
1580	1588	1590	1590	Gudrun	352	' Oh , it does n't matter , '
1595	1610	1590	1590	Gudrun	352	' If one jumps over the edge , one is bound to land somewhere . '
1611	1619	1621	1621	Ursula	264	' But is n't it very risky ? '
1633	1636	1637	1637	she	352	' Ah ! '
1641	1649	1637	1637	she	352	' What is it all but words ! '
1664	1680	1681	1681	she	352	' And how do you find home , now you have come back to it ? '
1706	1715	1703	1703	she	352	' I find myself completely out of it . '
1716	1720	1703	1703	she	352	' And father ? '
1736	1748	1749	1749	she	352	' I have n't thought about him : I 've refrained , '
1753	1756	1758	1758	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
1818	1829	1830	1830	she	352	' Shall we go out and look at that wedding ? '
1843	1846	1848	1848	Ursula	264	' Yes ! '
2159	2169	2171	2171	Gudrun	352	' It is like a country in an underworld , '
2173	2248	2171	2171	Gudrun	352	' The colliers bring it above - ground with them , shovel it up . Ursula , it 's marvellous , it 's really marvellous - it 's really wonderful , another world . The people are all ghouls , and everything is ghostly . Everything is a ghoulish replica of the real world , a replica , a ghoul , all soiled , everything sordid . It 's like being mad , Ursula . '
2603	2630	2589	2589	her	352	' I want to go back , I want to go away , I want not to know it , not to know that this exists . '
2643	2652	2653	2653	she	352	' You hate this , do n't you ? '
2656	2661	2663	2663	Gudrun	352	' It bewilders me , '
2665	2672	2674	2674	Ursula	264	' You wo n't stay long , '
2865	2871	2873	2873	Gudrun	352	' Let us go back , '
2878	2885	2873	2873	Gudrun	352	' There are all those people . '
2894	2899	2901	2901	Ursula	264	' Never mind them , '
2903	2905	2901	2901	Ursula	264	' they 're
2919	2919	2914	2914	they	537	'
2920	2928	2930	2930	Gudrun	352	' But must we go through them ? '
2932	2934	2914	2914	they	537	' They 're
2941	2969	2914	2914	they	537	' said Ursula , going forward . And together the two sisters approached the group of uneasy , watchful common people . They were chiefly women , colliers '
3041	3047	3055	3055	Gudrun	352	' What price the stockings ! '
3113	3122	3123	3123	she	559	' I wo n't go into the church , '
3323	3331	3333	3333	Gudrun	352	' Are we going to stay here ? '
3335	3343	3345	3345	Ursula	264	' I was only resting a minute , '
3353	3373	3345	3345	Ursula	264	' We will stand in the corner by the fives - court , we shall see everything from there . '
3899	3906	3907	3907	she	352	' His totem is the wolf , '
3912	3922	3907	3907	she	352	' His mother is an old , unbroken wolf . '
3969	3973	3974	3974	she	352	' Good God ! '
3979	3984	3974	3974	she	352	' what is this ? '
3997	4006	3992	3992	she	352	' I shall know more of that man . '
4071	4098	4099	4099	she	352	' Am I REALLY singled out for him in some way , is there really some pale gold , arctic light that envelopes only us two ? '
5824	5831	5838	5840	the expectant people	662	' How do I get out ? '
5918	5924	5925	5925	she	649	' That 's done it ! '
6186	6191	6192	6192	she	677	' Tibs ! Tibs ! '
6228	6231	6232	6232	she	677	' Tibs ! '
6290	6297	6299	6299	her	677	' Ah - h - h ! '
6374	6380	6382	6385	the vulgar women below	690	' Ay , after her ! '
6556	6564	6566	6566	Birkin	179	' We 'll bring up the rear , '
6575	6578	6580	6581	the father	659	' Ay ! '
6792	6794	6766	6766	he	180	' I 'm
6801	6806	6807	6807	We	702	' he was saying . '
6835	6835	6829	6829	you	180	'
6836	6843	6845	6846	Mr Crich	180	' We are usually to time , '
6848	6851	6829	6829	you	180	' And I 'm
6855	6859	6829	6829	you	180	' said Birkin . '
6873	6876	6872	6872	I	0	'm sorry . '
7014	7023	7024	7024	she	706	' What do you think of Rupert Birkin ? '
7042	7051	7053	7053	Gudrun	352	' What do I think of Rupert Birkin ? '
7055	7102	7053	7053	Gudrun	352	' I think he 's attractive - decidedly attractive . What I ca n't stand about him is his way with other people - his way of treating any little fool as if she were his greatest consideration . One feels so awfully sold , oneself . '
7103	7110	7112	7112	Ursula	264	' Why does he do it ? '
7114	7130	7132	7132	Gudrun	352	' Because he has no real critical faculty - of people , at all events , '
7134	7158	7132	7132	Gudrun	352	' I tell you , he treats any little fool as he treats me or you - and it 's such an insult . '
7159	7165	7167	7167	Ursula	264	' Oh , it is , '
7169	7174	7167	7167	Ursula	264	' One must discriminate . '
7175	7180	7182	7182	Gudrun	352	' One MUST discriminate , '
7184	7207	7182	7182	Gudrun	352	' But he 's a wonderful chap , in other respects - a marvellous personality . But you ca n't trust him . '
7208	7211	7213	7213	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
7865	7976	7863	7864	the Criches	178	' home . It was a long , low old house , a sort of manor farm , that spread along the top of a slope just beyond the narrow little lake of Willey Water . Shortlands looked across a sloping meadow that might be a park , because of the large , solitary trees that stood here and there , across the water of the narrow lake , at the wooded hill that successfully hid the colliery valley beyond , but did not quite hide the rising smoke . Nevertheless , the scene was rural and picturesque , very peaceful , and the house had a charm of its own .
8082	8090	8076	8078	one Crich woman	735	' Helen , come here a minute , '
8091	8100	8076	8078	one Crich woman	735	' Marjory , I want you - here . '
8101	8111	8076	8078	one Crich woman	735	' Oh , I say , Mrs Witham - . '
8265	8272	8274	8274	Gerald	264	' What is it , mother ? '
8276	8281	8282	8282	she	174	' Nothing , nothing ! '
8305	8314	8315	8315	she	174	' How do you do , Mr Birkin , '
8341	8346	8348	8348	Birkin	179	' Oh Mrs Crich , '
8357	8366	8348	8348	Birkin	179	' I could n't come to you before . '
8367	8377	8378	8378	she	174	' I do n't know half the people here , '
8396	8404	8406	8406	Birkin	179	' And you do n't like strangers ? '
8408	8442	8406	8406	Birkin	179	' I myself can never see why one should take account of people , just because they happen to be in the room with one : why SHOULD I know they are there ? '
8443	8450	8456	8456	her	174	' Why indeed , why indeed ! '
8462	8535	8456	8456	her	174	' Except that they ARE there . I do n't know people whom I find in the house . The children introduce them to me - " Mother , this is Mr So - and - so . " I am no further . What has Mr So - and - so to do with his own name ? - and what have I to do with either him or his name ? '
8731	8738	8739	8739	he	747	' People do n't really matter , '
8765	8773	8774	8774	she	584	' How do you mean , MATTER ? '
8778	8787	8788	8788	he	747	' Not many people are anything at all , '
8800	8830	8788	8788	he	747	' They jingle and giggle . It would be much better if they were just wiped out . Essentially , they do n't exist , they are n't there . '
8839	8847	8848	8848	she	584	' But we did n't imagine them , '
8852	8867	8831	8831	She	584	' There 's nothing to imagine , that 's why they do n't exist . '
8868	8871	8872	8872	she	584	' Well , '
8875	8953	8872	8872	she	584	' I would hardly go as far as that . There they are , whether they exist or no . It does n't rest with me to decide on their existence . I only know that I ca n't be expected to take count of them all . You ca n't expect me to know them , just because they happen to be there . As far as I go they might as well not be there . '
8954	8957	8958	8958	he	747	' Exactly , '
8961	8966	8967	8967	she	584	' Might n't they ? '
8971	8976	8977	8977	he	747	' Just as well , '
8987	9000	9001	9001	she	584	' Except that they ARE there , and that 's a nuisance , '
9004	9014	9015	9015	she	584	' There are my sons - in - law , '
9025	9118	9015	9015	she	584	' Now Laura 's got married , there 's another . And I really do n't know John from James yet . They come up to me and call me mother . I know what they will say - " how are you , mother ? " I ought to say , " I am not your mother , in any sense . " But what is the use ? There they are . I have had children of my own . I suppose I know them from another woman 's children . '
9119	9125	9126	9126	he	756	' One would suppose so , '
9182	9189	9190	9190	she	757	' Are my children all there ? '
9203	9212	9213	9213	he	756	' I scarcely know them , except Gerald , '
9216	9219	9220	9220	she	757	' Gerald ! '
9223	9248	9220	9220	she	757	' He 's the most wanting of them all . You 'd never think it , to look at him now , would you ? '
9249	9252	9254	9254	Birkin	179	' No , '
9273	9276	9277	9277	she	757	' Ay , '
9317	9327	9328	9328	she	757	' I should like him to have a friend , '
9331	9339	9328	9328	she	757	' He has never had a friend . '
9361	9369	9370	9370	he	756	' Am I my brother 's keeper ? '
9608	9646	9647	9647	She	771	' Wo n't you come and take your hat off , mother dear ? We shall be sitting down to eat in a minute , and it 's a formal occasion , darling , is n't it ? '
9906	9920	9889	9889	her	794	' Gerald , you forget father , when you make that unearthly noise . '
9921	9925	9926	9926	he	687	' Do I ? '
9936	9948	9933	9934	the company	750	' Father is lying down , he is not quite well . '
9949	9956	9958	9962	one of the married daughters	796	' How is he , really ? '
9984	9995	9997	9997	Winifred	194	' He has no pain , but he feels tired , '
10071	10078	10061	10061	she	584	' Who is that young man ? '
10079	10085	10086	10086	Birkin	179	' I do n't know , '
10090	10097	10098	10098	she	584	' Have I seen him before ? '
10101	10112	10113	10113	he	584	' I do n't think so . I have n't , '
10213	10216	10218	10218	Diana	195	' Mother , '
10229	10239	10218	10218	Diana	195	' I may have wine , may n't I ? '
10240	10248	10255	10255	she	584	' Yes , you may have wine , '
10274	10281	10282	10282	she	195	' Gerald should n't forbid me , '
10292	10298	10300	10301	her brother	810	' All right , Di , '
10397	10400	10401	10401	she	177	' No , '
10404	10429	10401	10401	she	177	' I think that the appeal to patriotism is a mistake . It is like one house of business rivalling another house of business . '
10430	10441	10443	10443	Gerald	264	' Well you can hardly say that , can you ? '
10453	10485	10443	10443	Gerald	264	' You could n't call a race a business concern , could you ? - and nationality roughly corresponds to race , I think . I think it is MEANT to . '
10505	10514	10515	10515	she	177	' DO you think race corresponds with nationality ? '
10539	10559	10560	10560	he	810	' I think Gerald is right - race is the essential element in nationality , in Europe at least , '
10585	10628	10577	10577	she	177	' Yes , but even so , is the patriotic appeal an appeal to the racial instinct ? Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct , the COMMERCIAL instinct ? And is n't this what we mean by nationality ? '
10629	10632	10634	10634	Birkin	179	' Probably , '
10661	10670	10671	10671	he	264	' A race may have its commercial aspect , '
10674	10716	10671	10671	he	264	' In fact it must . It is like a family . You MUST make provision . And to make provision you have got to strive against other families , other nations . I do n't see why you should n't . '
10731	10757	10728	10728	she	177	' Yes , I think it is always wrong to provoke a spirit of rivalry . It makes bad blood . And bad blood accumulates . '
10758	10772	10774	10774	Gerald	264	' But you ca n't do away with the spirit of emulation altogether ? '
10776	10789	10774	10774	Gerald	264	' It is one of the necessary incentives to production and improvement . '
10790	10793	10795	10795	Hermione	177	' Yes , '
10800	10810	10795	10795	Hermione	177	' I think you can do away with it . '
10811	10816	10818	10818	Birkin	179	' I must say , '
10820	10828	10818	10818	Birkin	179	' I detest the spirit of emulation . '
10860	10868	10869	10869	she	177	' You do hate it , yes , '
10876	10880	10881	10881	he	814	' Detest it , '
10884	10887	10888	10888	she	177	' Yes , '
10895	10898	10899	10899	Gerald	264	' But , '
10902	10933	10899	10899	Gerald	264	' you do n't allow one man to take away his neighbour 's living , so why should you allow one nation to take away the living from another nation ? '
10954	10976	10943	10943	she	177	' It is not always a question of possessions , is it ? It is not all a question of goods ? '
10987	10994	10995	10995	he	264	' Yes , more or less , '
10998	11040	10995	10995	he	264	' If I go and take a man 's hat from off his head , that hat becomes a symbol of that man 's liberty . When he fights me for his hat , he is fighting me for his liberty . '
11045	11048	11049	11049	she	177	' Yes , '
11054	11090	11049	11049	she	177	' But that way of arguing by imaginary instances is not supposed to be genuine , is it ? A man does NOT come and take my hat from off my head , does he ? '
11091	11099	11101	11101	Gerald	264	' Only because the law prevents him , '
11103	11107	11109	11109	Birkin	179	' Not only , '
11111	11126	11109	11109	Birkin	179	' Ninety - nine men out of a hundred do n't want my hat . '
11127	11135	11137	11137	Gerald	264	' That 's a matter of opinion , '
11139	11144	11146	11147	the bridegroom	592	' Or the hat , '
11149	11163	11165	11165	Birkin	179	' And if he does want my hat , such as it is , '
11167	11234	11165	11165	Birkin	179	' why , surely it is open to me to decide , which is a greater loss to me , my hat , or my liberty as a free and indifferent man . If I am compelled to offer fight , I lose the latter . It is a question which is worth more to me , my pleasant liberty of conduct , or my hat . '
11235	11238	11240	11240	Hermione	177	' Yes , '
11246	11249	11243	11243	Birkin	179	' Yes . '
11250	11265	11266	11267	the bride	649	' But would you let somebody come and snatch your hat off your head ? '
11290	11293	11294	11294	she	177	' No , '
11310	11325	11294	11294	she	177	' No , I should n't let anybody take my hat off my head . '
11326	11333	11335	11335	Gerald	264	' How would you prevent it ? '
11337	11343	11345	11345	Hermione	177	' I do n't know , '
11348	11355	11345	11345	Hermione	177	' Probably I should kill him . '
11374	11378	11380	11380	Gerald	264	' Of course , '
11382	11408	11380	11380	Gerald	264	' I can see Rupert 's point . It is a question to him whether his hat or his peace of mind is more important . '
11409	11414	11416	11416	Birkin	179	' Peace of body , '
11418	11426	11428	11428	Gerald	264	' Well , as you like there , '
11430	11443	11428	11428	Gerald	264	' But how are you going to decide this for a nation ? '
11444	11449	11451	11451	Birkin	179	' Heaven preserve me , '
11453	11462	11463	11463	Gerald	264	' Yes , but suppose you have to ? '
11466	11492	11428	11428	Gerald	264	' Then it is the same . If the national crown - piece is an old hat , then the thieving gent may have it . '
11493	11506	11508	11508	Gerald	264	' But CAN the national or racial hat be an old hat ? '
11510	11520	11522	11522	Birkin	179	' Pretty well bound to be , I believe , '
11524	11526	11428	11428	Gerald	264	' I 'm
11531	11534	11428	11428	Gerald	264	' said Gerald .
11535	11543	11545	11545	Hermione	177	' I do n't agree , Rupert , '
11547	11551	11553	11553	Birkin	179	' All right , '
11555	11557	11428	11428	Gerald	264	' I 'm
11565	11568	11428	11428	Gerald	264	' laughed Gerald .
11569	11578	11580	11580	Diana	195	' And a fool you look in it , '
11592	11596	11428	11428	Gerald	264	' Oh , we 're
11607	11612	11428	11428	Gerald	264	' cried Laura Crich . '
11620	11646	11619	11619	We	820	're going to drink toasts . Let us drink toasts . Toasts - glasses , glasses - now then , toasts ! Speech ! Speech ! '
11710	11722	11723	11723	he	264	' Did I do it by accident , or on purpose ? '
11742	11747	11748	11748	He	264	' accidentally on purpose . '
11930	11937	11939	11939	Marshall	197	' Pretty cattle , very pretty , '
11950	11960	11939	11939	Marshall	197	' They give the best milk you can have . '
11961	11964	11966	11966	Birkin	179	' Yes , '
11968	11980	11982	11982	Marshall	197	' Eh , my little beauty , eh , my beauty ! '
12005	12013	12014	12014	he	264	' Who won the race , Lupton ? '
12038	12042	12043	12043	he	592	' The race ? '
12071	12092	12056	12056	He	592	' We got there together . At least she touched first , but I had my hand on her shoulder . '
12093	12098	12100	12100	Gerald	264	' What 's this ? '
12115	12118	12120	12120	Gerald	264	' H'm ! '
12125	12132	12120	12120	Gerald	264	' What made you late then ? '
12133	12144	12146	12146	Birkin	179	' Lupton would talk about the immortality of the soul , '
12148	12160	12146	12146	Birkin	179	' and then he had n't got a button - hook . '
12161	12165	12167	12167	Marshall	197	' Oh God ! '
12169	12191	12167	12167	Marshall	197	' The immortality of the soul on your wedding day ! Had n't you got anything better to occupy your mind ? '
12192	12199	12201	12202	the bridegroom	592	' What 's wrong with it ? '
12214	12234	12236	12241	the brother - in - law	843	' Sounds as if you were going to be executed instead of married . THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL ! '
12254	12261	12263	12263	Gerald	264	' And what did you decide ? '
12279	12291	12293	12293	Marshall	197	' You do n't want a soul today , my boy , '
12295	12303	12293	12293	Marshall	197	' It 'd be in your road . '
12304	12316	12318	12318	Gerald	264	' Christ ! Marshall , go and talk to somebody else , '
12324	12329	12293	12293	Marshall	197	' By God , I 'm
12332	12340	12293	12293	Marshall	197	' said Marshall , in a temper . '
12349	12349	12350	12350	He	592	'
12385	12393	12395	12395	Gerald	264	' There 's one thing , Lupton , '
12403	12419	12395	12395	Gerald	264	' Laura wo n't have brought such a fool into the family as Lottie did . '
12420	12426	12428	12428	Birkin	179	' Comfort yourself with that , '
12430	12438	12440	12441	the bridegroom	592	' I take no notice of them , '
12443	12454	12455	12455	Gerald	264	' What about this race then - who began it ? '
12458	12507	12395	12395	Gerald	264	' We were late . Laura was at the top of the churchyard steps when our cab came up . She saw Lupton bolting towards her . And she fled . But why do you look so cross ? Does it hurt your sense of the family dignity ? '
12508	12514	12516	12516	Gerald	264	' It does , rather , '
12518	12521	12516	12516	Gerald	264	' If you 're
12533	12545	12395	12395	Gerald	264	're not going to do it properly , leave it alone . '
12546	12551	12553	12553	Birkin	179	' Very nice aphorism , '
12555	12561	12563	12563	Gerald	264	' Do n't you agree ? '
12565	12568	12570	12570	Birkin	179	' Quite , '
12572	12584	12570	12570	Birkin	179	' Only it bores me rather , when you become aphoristic . '
12585	12600	12602	12602	Gerald	264	' Damn you , Rupert , you want all the aphorisms your own way , '
12604	12617	12633	12633	he	264	' No . I want them out of the way , and you 're
12624	12624	12633	12633	he	264	'
12645	12662	12663	12663	he	264	' You do n't believe in having any standard of behaviour at all , do you ? '
12669	12680	12633	12633	he	264	' Standard - no . I hate standards . But they 're
12701	12701	12633	12633	he	264	'
12702	12712	12714	12714	Gerald	264	' But what do you mean by being himself ? '
12716	12725	12714	12714	Gerald	264	' Is that an aphorism or a cliche ? '
12726	12793	12633	12633	he	264	' I mean just doing what you want to do . I think it was perfect good form in Laura to bolt from Lupton to the church door . It was almost a masterpiece in good form . It 's the hardest thing in the world to act spontaneously on one 's impulses - and it 's the only really gentlemanly thing to do - provided you 're
12799	12799	12633	12633	he	264	'
12800	12814	12816	12816	Gerald	264	' You do n't expect me to take you seriously , do you ? '
12818	12824	12827	12835	the very few people I do expect that of	849	' Yes , Gerald , you 're
12837	12837	12827	12835	the very few people I do expect that of	849	'
12838	12841	12843	12843	I	0	' Then I 'm
12867	12867	12857	12857	You	264	'
12868	12906	12827	12835	the very few people I do expect that of	849	' I think they always do . But I should like them to like the purely individual thing in themselves , which makes them act in singleness . And they only like to do the collective thing . '
12907	12911	12913	12913	Gerald	264	' And I , '
12916	12951	12913	12913	Gerald	264	' should n't like to be in a world of people who acted individually and spontaneously , as you call it . We should have everybody cutting everybody else 's throat in five minutes . '
12952	12965	12967	12967	Birkin	179	' That means YOU would like to be cutting everybody 's throat , '
12969	12975	12977	12977	Gerald	264	' How does that follow ? '
12980	12984	12986	12986	Birkin	179	' No man , '
12988	13062	12986	12986	Birkin	179	' cuts another man 's throat unless he wants to cut it , and unless the other man wants it cutting . This is a complete truth . It takes two people to make a murder : a murderer and a murderee . And a murderee is a man who is murderable . And a man who is murderable is a man who in a profound if hidden lust desires to be murdered . '
13063	13070	13072	13072	Gerald	264	' Sometimes you talk pure nonsense , '
13076	13108	13072	13072	Gerald	264	' As a matter of fact , none of us wants our throat cut , and most other people would like to cut it for us - some time or other - '
13109	13120	13122	13122	Birkin	179	' It 's a nasty view of things , Gerald , '
13124	13138	13122	13122	Birkin	179	' and no wonder you are afraid of yourself and your own unhappiness . '
13139	13147	13149	13149	Gerald	264	' How am I afraid of myself ? '
13151	13161	13149	13149	Gerald	264	' and I do n't think I am unhappy . '
13162	13189	13190	13190	Birkin	179	' You seem to have a lurking desire to have your gizzard slit , and imagine every man has his knife up his sleeve for you , '
13193	13201	13203	13203	Gerald	264	' How do you make that out ? '
13205	13209	13211	13211	Birkin	179	' From you , '
13736	13742	13744	13744	Birkin	179	' Did I startle you ? '
13751	13761	13744	13744	Birkin	179	' I thought you had heard me come in . '
13762	13765	13766	13766	she	860	' No , '
13789	13795	13796	13796	he	5367	' It is so dark , '
13799	13806	13796	13796	he	5367	' Shall we have the light ? '
13910	13916	13917	13917	he	5367	' You are doing catkins ? '
13936	13953	13917	13917	he	5367	' Are they as far out as this ? I had n't noticed them this year . '
13966	13972	13973	13973	he	5367	' The red ones too ! '
14001	14058	13990	13990	he	5367	' books . Ursula watched his intent progress . There was a stillness in his motion that hushed the activities of her heart . She seemed to be standing aside in arrested silence , watching him move in another , concentrated world . His presence was so quiet , almost like a vacancy in the corporate air .
14078	14088	14089	14089	he	5367	' Give them some crayons , wo n't you ? '
14092	14143	14089	14089	he	5367	' so that they can make the gynaecious flowers red , and the androgynous yellow . I 'd chalk them in plain , chalk in nothing else , merely the red and the yellow . Outline scarcely matters in this case . There is just the one fact to emphasise . '
14144	14151	14153	14153	Ursula	264	' I have n't any crayons , '
14155	14172	14089	14089	he	5367	' There will be some somewhere - red and yellow , that 's all you want . '
14182	14190	14191	14191	she	871	' It will make the books untidy , '
14199	14203	14204	14204	he	5367	' Not very , '
14207	14290	14292	14292	he	5367	' You must mark in these things obviously . It 's the fact you want to emphasise , not the subjective impression to record . What 's the fact ? - red little spiky stigmas of the female flower , dangling yellow male catkin , yellow pollen flying from one to the other . Make a pictorial record of the fact , as a child does when drawing a face - two eyes , one nose , mouth with teeth - so - '
14327	14333	14334	14334	she	871	' I saw your car , '
14339	14360	14334	14334	she	871	' Do you mind my coming to find you ? I wanted to see you when you were on duty . '
14407	14416	14434	14434	she	177	' How do you do , Miss Brangwen , '
14439	14447	14434	14434	she	177	' Do you mind my coming in ? '
14467	14471	14473	14473	Ursula	264	' Oh no , '
14475	14480	14482	14482	Hermione	177	' Are you SURE ? '
14498	14507	14509	14509	Ursula	264	' Oh no , I like it awfully , '
14560	14566	14567	14567	she	177	' What are you doing ? '
14577	14580	14581	14581	he	875	' Catkins , '
14584	14587	14588	14588	she	177	' Really ! '
14591	14600	14588	14588	she	177	' And what do you learn about them ? '
14749	14770	14771	14771	he	875	' Do you know the little red ovary flowers , that produce the nuts ? Have you ever noticed them ? '
14792	14795	14796	14796	she	177	' No , '
14799	14804	14776	14776	he	875	' What are they ? '
14805	14829	14776	14776	he	875	' Those are the little seed - producing flowers , and the long catkins , they only produce pollen , to fertilise them . '
14830	14837	14839	14839	Hermione	177	' Do they , do they ! '
14844	14864	14776	14776	he	875	' From those little red bits , the nuts come ; if they receive pollen from the long danglers . '
14865	14874	14878	14878	herself	177	' Little red flames , little red flames , '
14903	14912	14776	14776	he	875	' Are n't they beautiful ? I think they 're
14916	14937	14776	14776	he	875	' she said , moving close to Birkin , and pointing to the red filaments with her long , white finger .
14938	14946	14947	14947	he	875	' Had you never noticed them before ? '
14950	14956	14957	14957	she	177	' No , never before , '
14960	14969	14970	14970	he	875	' And now you will always see them , '
14973	14981	14982	14982	she	177	' Now I shall always see them , '
14985	14997	14982	14982	she	177	' Thank you so much for showing me . I think they 're
15005	15005	14982	14982	she	177	'
15138	15145	15146	15146	she	177	' Your sister has come home ? '
15149	15152	15154	15154	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
15156	15166	15130	15130	Hermione	177	' And does she like being back in Beldover ? '
15167	15170	15172	15172	Ursula	264	' No , '
15174	15230	15130	15130	Hermione	177	' No , I wonder she can bear it . It takes all my strength , to bear the ugliness of this district , when I stay here . Wo n't you come and see me ? Wo n't you come with your sister to stay at Breadalby for a few days ? - do - '
15231	15237	15239	15239	Ursula	264	' Thank you very much , '
15241	15249	15251	15251	Hermione	177	' Then I will write to you , '

15304	15307	15309	15309	Ursula	264	' No , '
15311	15325	15130	15130	Hermione	177	' I think it is perfectly wonderful - like a flash of instinct . '
15326	15333	15335	15335	Ursula	264	' Her little carvings ARE strange , '
15337	15346	15251	15251	Hermione	177	' Perfectly beautiful - full of primitive passion - '
15347	15409	15130	15130	Hermione	177	' Is n't it queer that she always likes little things ? - she must always work small things , that one can put between one 's hands , birds and tiny animals . She likes to look through the wrong end of the opera glasses , and see the world that way - why is it , do you think ? '
15428	15431	15433	15433	Hermione	177	' Yes , '
15437	15453	15433	15433	Hermione	177	' It is curious . The little things seem to be more subtle to her - '
15454	15477	15479	15479	Hermione	177	' But they are n't , are they ? A mouse is n't any more subtle than a lion , is it ? '
15511	15517	15518	15518	she	879	' I do n't know , '
15521	15526	15527	15527	she	879	' Rupert , Rupert , '
15541	15551	15552	15552	she	879	' Are little things more subtle than big things ? '
15577	15580	15581	15581	he	880	' Dunno , '
15584	15589	15591	15591	Ursula	264	' I hate subtleties , '
15599	15603	15604	15604	she	879	' Do you ? '
15607	15618	15620	15620	Ursula	264	' I always think they are a sign of weakness , '
15659	15667	15668	15668	she	879	' Do you really think , Rupert , '
15678	15702	15668	15668	she	879	' do you really think it is worth while ? Do you really think the children are better for being roused to consciousness ? '
15744	15752	15753	15753	he	881	' They are not roused to consciousness , '
15756	15766	15753	15753	he	881	' Consciousness comes to them , willy - nilly . '
15767	15818	15727	15728	the woman	882	' But do you think they are better for having it quickened , stimulated ? Is n't it better that they should remain unconscious of the hazel , is n't it better that they should see as a whole , without all this pulling to pieces , all this knowledge ? '
15819	15846	15847	15847	he	881	' Would you rather , for yourself , know or not know , that the little red flowers are there , putting out for the pollen ? '
15876	15882	15883	15883	she	882	' I do n't know , '
15889	15895	15883	15883	she	882	' I do n't know . '
15896	15910	15911	15911	he	881	' But knowing is everything to you , it is all your life , '
15921	15925	15926	15926	she	882	' Is it ? '
15929	15951	15952	15952	he	881	' To know , that is your all , that is your life - you have only this , this knowledge , '
15955	15972	15952	15952	he	881	' There is only one tree , there is only one fruit , in your mouth . '
15980	15984	15985	15985	she	882	' Is there ? '
16005	16011	15985	15985	she	882	' What fruit , Rupert ? '
16012	16017	16018	16018	he	881	' The eternal apple , '
16028	16031	16032	16032	she	882	' Yes , '
16073	16145	16054	16054	herself	882	' But leaving me apart , Rupert ; do you think the children are better , richer , happier , for all this knowledge ; do you really think they are ? Or is it better to leave them untouched , spontaneous .

16163	16197	16160	16160	she	882	' Had n't they better be anything than grow up crippled , crippled in their souls , crippled in their feelings - so thrown back - so turned back on themselves - incapable - '

16249	16296	16243	16243	she	882	' never carried away , out of themselves , always conscious , always self - conscious , always aware of themselves . Is n't ANYTHING better than this ? Better be animals , mere animals with no mind at all , than this , this NOTHINGNESS - '
16297	16312	16313	16313	he	885	' But do you think it is knowledge that makes us unliving and selfconscious ? '
16327	16330	16331	16331	she	882	' Yes , '
16366	16372	16373	16373	she	882	' It is the mind , '
16376	16382	16373	16373	she	882	' and that is death . '
16391	16397	16398	16398	she	882	' Is n't the mind - '
16409	16447	16398	16398	she	882	' is n't it our death ? Does n't it destroy all our spontaneity , all our instincts ? Are not the young people growing up today , really dead before they have a chance to live ? '
16448	16461	16462	16462	he	885	' Not because they have too much mind , but too little , '
16466	16471	16472	16472	she	882	' Are you SURE ? '
16475	16493	16472	16472	she	882	' It seems to me the reverse . They are overconscious , burdened to death with consciousness . '
16494	16505	16506	16506	he	885	' Imprisoned within a limited , false set of concepts , '
16526	16540	16541	16541	she	882	' When we have knowledge , do n't we lose everything but knowledge ? '
16545	16611	16541	16541	she	882	' If I know about the flower , do n't I lose the flower and have only the knowledge ? Are n't we exchanging the substance for the shadow , are n't we forfeiting life for this dead quality of knowledge ? And what does it mean to me , after all ? What does all this knowing mean to me ? It means nothing . '
16612	16619	16620	16620	he	885	' You are merely making words , '
16623	16766	16620	16620	he	885	' knowledge means everything to you . Even your animalism , you want it in your head . You do n't want to BE an animal , you want to observe your own animal functions , to get a mental thrill out of them . It is all purely secondary - and more decadent than the most hide - bound intellectualism . What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism , this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts ? Passion and the instincts - you want them hard enough , but through your head , in your consciousness . It all takes place in your head , under that skull of yours . Only you wo n't be conscious of what ACTUALLY is : you want the lie that will match the rest of your furniture . '
16796	16806	16807	16807	he	888	' It 's all that Lady of Shalott business , '
16827	16903	16816	16816	He	888	' You 've got that mirror , your own fixed will , your immortal understanding , your own tight conscious world , and there is nothing beyond it . There , in the mirror , you must have everything . But now you have come to all your conclusions , you want to go back and be like a savage , without knowledge . You want a life of pure sensation and " passion . " '
16932	16940	16941	16941	he	888	' But your passion is a lie , '
16946	17030	16941	16941	he	888	' It is n't passion at all , it is your WILL . It 's your bullying will . You want to clutch things and have them in your power . You want to have things in your power . And why ? Because you have n't got any real body , any dark sensual body of life . You have no sensuality . You have only your will and your conceit of consciousness , and your lust for power , to KNOW . '
17095	17098	17099	17099	he	888	' Spontaneous ! '
17102	17247	17099	17099	he	888	' You and spontaneity ! You , the most deliberate thing that ever walked or crawled ! You 'd be verily deliberately spontaneous - that 's you . Because you want to have everything in your own volition , your deliberate voluntary consciousness . You want it all in that loathsome little skull of yours , that ought to be cracked like a nut . For you 'll be the same till it is cracked , like an insect in its skin . If one cracked your skull perhaps one might get a spontaneous , passionate woman out of you , with real sensuality . As it is , what you want is pornography - looking at yourself in mirrors , watching your naked animal actions in mirrors , so that you can have it all in your consciousness , make it all mental . '
17293	17301	17302	17302	she	890	' But do you really WANT sensuality ? '
17319	17322	17323	17323	he	891	' Yes , '
17326	17376	17323	17323	he	891	' that and nothing else , at this point . It is a fulfilment - the great dark knowledge you ca n't have in your head - the dark involuntary being . It is death to one 's self - but it is the coming into being of another . '
17377	17391	17392	17392	she	890	' But how ? How can you have knowledge not in your head ? '
17402	17407	17408	17408	he	891	' In the blood , '
17411	17446	17408	17408	he	891	' when the mind and the known world is drowned in darkness everything must go - there must be the deluge . Then you find yourself a palpable body of darkness , a demon - '
17447	17457	17458	17458	she	890	' But why should I be a demon - ? '
17461	17471	17472	17472	he	891	' " WOMAN WAILING FOR HER DEMON LOVER " - '

17599	17610	17611	17611	she	890	' You know all about it , do n't you ? '
17622	17625	17626	17626	he	891	' Enough , '

17884	17894	17895	17895	he	5376	' There 's the whole difference in the world , '
17898	17995	17895	17895	he	5376	' between the actual sensual being , and the vicious mental - deliberate profligacy our lot goes in for . In our night - time , there 's always the electricity switched on , we watch ourselves , we get it all in the head , really . You 've got to lapse out before you can know what sensual reality is , lapse into unknowingness , and give up your volition . You 've got to do it . You 've got to learn not - to - be , before you can come into being .
17996	18029	17878	17878	he	5376	' But we have got such a conceit of ourselves - that 's where it is . We are so conceited , and so unproud . We 've got no pride , we 're

19504	19558	19498	19498	Gudrun	352	' But supposing I did . Supposing I want to swim up that water . It is impossible , it is one of the impossibilities of life , for me to take my clothes off now and jump in . But is n't it RIDICULOUS , does n't it simply prevent our living ! '
19629	19640	19642	19642	Gudrun	352	' Do n't you think it 's attractive , Ursula ? '
19644	19647	19649	19649	Ursula	264	' Very , '
19651	19657	19649	19649	Ursula	264	' Very peaceful and charming . '

19676	19696	19709	19709	Gudrun	352	' Oh , eighteenth century , for certain ; Dorothy Wordsworth and Jane Austen , do n't you think ? '
19700	19707	19709	19709	Gudrun	352	' Do n't you think so ? '
19711	19750	19649	19649	Ursula	264	' Perhaps . But I do n't think the Criches fit the period . I know Gerald is putting in a private electric plant , for lighting the house , and is making all kinds of latest improvements . '
19757	19761	19762	19762	she	352	' Of course , '
19765	19771	19762	19762	she	352	' that 's quite inevitable . '
19772	19775	19777	19777	Ursula	264	' Quite , '
19779	19844	19777	19777	Ursula	264	' He is several generations of youngness at one go . They hate him for it . He takes them all by the scruff of the neck , and fairly flings them along . He 'll have to die soon , when he 's made every possible improvement , and there will be nothing more to improve . He 's got GO , anyhow . '
19845	19853	19855	19855	Gudrun	352	' Certainly , he 's got go , '
19857	19890	19855	19855	Gudrun	352	' In fact I 've never seen a man that showed signs of so much . The unfortunate thing is , where does his GO go to , what becomes of it ? '

19900	19909	19898	19898	Ursula	264	' It goes in applying the latest appliances ! '
19910	19913	19915	19915	Gudrun	352	' Exactly , '
19917	19925	19927	19927	Ursula	264	' You know he shot his brother ? '
19929	19934	19936	19936	Gudrun	352	' Shot his brother ? '
19944	20001	19936	19936	Gudrun	352	' Did n't you know ? Oh yes ! - I thought you knew . He and his brother were playing together with a gun . He told his brother to look down the gun , and it was loaded , and blew the top of his head off . Is n't it a horrible story ? '
20002	20006	20008	20008	Gudrun	352	' How fearful ! '
20010	20017	20008	20008	Gudrun	352	' But it is long ago ? '
20018	20027	20029	20029	Ursula	264	' Oh yes , they were quite boys , '
20031	20045	20029	20029	Ursula	264	' I think it is one of the most horrible stories I know . '
20046	20060	20008	20008	Gudrun	352	' And he of course did not know that the gun was loaded ? '
20061	20111	20029	20029	Ursula	264	' Yes . You see it was an old thing that had been lying in the stable for years . Nobody dreamed it would ever go off , and of course , no one imagined it was loaded . But is n't it dreadful , that it should happen ? '
20112	20115	20117	20117	Gudrun	352	' Frightful ! '
20119	20224	20117	20117	Gudrun	352	' And is n't it horrible too to think of such a thing happening to one , when one was a child , and having to carry the responsibility of it all through one 's life . Imagine it , two boys playing together - then this comes upon them , for no reason whatever - out of the air . Ursula , it 's very frightening ! Oh , it 's one of the things I ca n't bear . Murder , that is thinkable , because there 's a will behind it . But a thing like that to HAPPEN to one - '
20225	20235	20237	20237	Ursula	264	' Perhaps there WAS an unconscious will behind it , '
20239	20258	20237	20237	Ursula	264	' This playing at killing has some primitive DESIRE for killing in it , do n't you think ? '
20259	20262	20264	20264	Gudrun	352	' Desire ! '
20272	20322	20264	20264	Gudrun	352	' I ca n't see that they were even playing at killing . I suppose one boy said to the other , " You look down the barrel while I pull the trigger , and see what happens . " It seems to me the purest form of accident . '
20323	20326	20328	20328	Ursula	264	' No , '
20330	20367	20328	20328	Ursula	264	' I could n't pull the trigger of the emptiest gun in the world , not if some - one were looking down the barrel . One instinctively does n't do it - one ca n't . '
20379	20383	20384	20384	she	352	' Of course , '
20388	20421	20384	20384	she	352	' If one is a woman , and grown up , one 's instinct prevents one . But I can not see how that applies to a couple of boys playing together . '
20429	20432	20434	20434	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
20452	20458	20441	20442	a woman	941	' Oh damn the thing ! '
20504	20509	20511	20511	Laura	188	' Thanks so much , '
20525	20534	20511	20511	Laura	188	' It is n't right on the hinges . '
20535	20538	20540	20540	Ursula	264	' No , '
20542	20545	20540	20540	Ursula	264	' And they 're

20550	20553	20555	20555	Laura	188	' Surprising ! '
20557	20563	20565	20565	Hermione	177	' How do you do , '
20582	20650	20575	20575	she	177	' It 's nice now . Are you going for a walk ? Yes . Is n't the young green beautiful ? So beautiful - quite burning . Good morning - good morning - you 'll come and see me ? - thank you so much - next week - yes - good - bye , g - o - o - d b - y - e. '
20733	20741	20726	20726	Ursula	264	' I do think she 's impudent . '
20742	20748	20750	20750	Gudrun	352	' Who , Hermione Roddice ? '
20752	20755	20750	20750	Gudrun	352	' Why ? '
20756	20765	20726	20726	Ursula	264	' The way she treats one - impudence ! '
20766	20780	20782	20782	Gudrun	352	' Why , Ursula , what did you notice that was so impudent ? '
20786	20835	20726	20726	Ursula	264	' Her whole manner . Oh , It 's impossible , the way she tries to bully one . Pure bullying . She 's an impudent woman . " You 'll come and see me , " as if we should be falling over ourselves for the privilege . '
20836	20853	20855	20855	Gudrun	352	' I ca n't understand , Ursula , what you are so much put out about , '
20861	20880	20855	20855	Gudrun	352	' One knows those women are impudent - these free women who have emancipated themselves from the aristocracy . '
20881	20891	20893	20893	Ursula	264	' But it is so UNNECESSARY - so vulgar , '
20895	20929	20726	20726	Ursula	264	' No , I do n't see it . And if I did - pour moi , elle n'existe pas . I do n't grant her the power to be impudent to me . '
20930	20938	20940	20940	Ursula	264	' Do you think she likes you ? '
20942	20954	20726	20726	Ursula	264	' Well , no , I should n't think she did . '
20955	20971	20726	20726	Ursula	264	' Then why does she ask you to go to Breadalby and stay with her ? '
20981	20993	20726	20726	Ursula	264	' After all , she 's got the sense to know we 're
21000	21004	20972	20972	Gudrun	352	' said Gudrun . '
21044	21044	21039	21039	herself	177	'
21052	21057	21058	21058	she	955	' I doubt it , '
21061	21088	21058	21058	she	955	' Really she risks nothing . I suppose we ought to admire her for knowing she CAN invite us - school teachers - and risk nothing . '
21089	21092	21094	21094	Gudrun	352	' Precisely ! '
21096	21136	21094	21094	Gudrun	352	' Think of the myriads of women that dare n't do it . She makes the most of her privileges - that 's something . I suppose , really , we should do the same , in her place . '
21137	21140	21142	21142	Ursula	264	' No , '
21144	21167	21142	21142	Ursula	264	' No . It would bore me . I could n't spend my time playing her games . It 's infra dig . '
21201	21205	21207	21207	Ursula	264	' Of course , '
21210	21282	21207	21207	Ursula	264	' she ought to thank her stars if we will go and see her . You are perfectly beautiful , a thousand times more beautiful than ever she is or was , and to my thinking , a thousand times more beautifully dressed , for she never looks fresh and natural , like a flower , always old , thought - out ; and we ARE more intelligent than most people . '
21283	21286	21288	21288	Gudrun	352	' Undoubtedly ! '
21290	21300	21302	21302	Ursula	264	' And it ought to be admitted , simply , '
21304	21309	21311	21311	Gudrun	352	' Certainly it ought , '
21313	21365	21311	21311	Gudrun	352	' But you 'll find that the really chic thing is to be so absolutely ordinary , so perfectly commonplace and like the person in the street , that you really are a masterpiece of humanity , not the person in the street actually , but the artistic creation of her - '
21366	21370	21372	21372	Ursula	264	' How awful ! '
21374	21412	21311	21311	Gudrun	352	' Yes , Ursula , it IS awful , in most respects . You dare n't be anything that is n't amazingly A TERRE , SO much A TERRE that it is the artistic creation of ordinariness . '
21413	21425	21427	21427	Ursula	264	' It 's very dull to create oneself into nothing better , '
21429	21433	21435	21435	Gudrun	352	' Very dull ! '
21437	21468	21435	21435	Gudrun	352	' Really Ursula , it is dull , that 's just the word . One longs to be high - flown , and make speeches like Corneille , after it . '
21480	21483	21485	21485	Ursula	264	' Strut , '
21487	21500	21485	21485	Ursula	264	' One wants to strut , to be a swan among geese . '
21501	21504	21506	21506	Gudrun	352	' Exactly , '
21508	21514	21506	21506	Gudrun	352	' a swan among geese . '
21515	21526	21528	21528	Ursula	264	' They are all so busy playing the ugly duckling , '
21534	21586	21528	21528	Ursula	264	' And I do n't feel a bit like a humble and pathetic ugly duckling . I do feel like a swan among geese - I ca n't help it . They make one feel so . And I do n't care what THEY think of me . FE M'EN FICHE . '
21601	21619	21620	21620	she	352	' Of course , the only thing to do is to despise them all - just all , '
22004	22014	21998	21998	Gerald	264	' Hallo , Rupert , where are you going ? '
22015	22025	22030	22030	Gerald	264	' London . So are you , I suppose . '
22026	22029	21998	21998	Gerald	264	' Yes - '
22041	22050	22051	22051	he	959	' We 'll travel together if you like , '
22054	22062	22064	22064	Birkin	179	' Do n't you usually go first ? '
22066	22074	22076	22076	Gerald	264	' I ca n't stand the crowd , '
22078	22097	22076	22076	Gerald	264	' But third'll be all right . There 's a restaurant car , we can have some tea . '
22113	22122	22123	22123	Birkin	179	' What were you reading in the paper ? '
22132	22146	22147	22147	he	264	' Is n't it funny , what they DO put in the newspapers , '
22150	22156	22157	22157	he	959	' Here are two leaders - '
22164	22173	22174	22174	he	959	' full of the ordinary newspaper ca nt - '
22180	22249	22174	22174	he	959	' and then there 's this little - I dunno what you 'd call it , essay , almost - appearing with the leaders , and saying there must arise a man who will give new values to things , give us new truths , a new attitude to life , or else we shall be a crumbling nothingness in a few years , a country in ruin - '
22250	22265	22267	22267	Birkin	179	' I suppose that 's a bit of newspaper ca nt , as well , '
22269	22283	22285	22285	Gerald	264	' It sounds as if the man meant it , and quite genuinely , '
22287	22293	22295	22295	Birkin	179	' Give it to me , '
22350	22358	22359	22359	he	264	' I believe the man means it , '
22362	22370	22359	22359	he	264	' as far as he means anything . '
22371	22390	22392	22392	Gerald	264	' And do you think it 's true ? Do you think we really want a new gospel ? '
22399	22483	22394	22394	Birkin	179	' I think the people who say they want a new religion are the last to accept anything new . They want novelty right enough . But to stare straight at this life that we 've brought upon ourselves , and reject it , absolutely smash up the old idols of ourselves , that we sh'll never do . You 've got very badly to want to get rid of the old , before anything new will appear - even in the self . '
22489	22506	22507	22507	he	264	' You think we ought to break up this life , just start and let fly ? '
22510	22545	22484	22484	Gerald	264	' This life . Yes I do . We 've got to bust it completely , or shrivel inside it , as in a tight skin . For it wo n't expand any more . '
22566	22587	22588	22588	he	264	' And how do you propose to begin ? I suppose you mean , reform the whole order of society ? '
22610	22618	22619	22619	he	959	' I do n't propose at all , '
22622	22664	22619	22619	he	959	' When we really want to go for something better , we shall smash the old . Until then , any sort of proposal , or making proposals , is no more than a tiresome game for self - important people . '
22689	22699	22678	22678	he	264	' So you really think things are very bad ? '
22700	22704	22678	22678	he	264	' Completely bad . '
22710	22715	22678	22678	he	264	' In what way ? '
22716	22720	22722	22722	Birkin	179	' Every way , '
22724	22834	22722	22722	Birkin	179	' We are such dreary liars . Our one idea is to lie to ourselves . We have an ideal of a perfect world , clean and straight and sufficient . So we cover the earth with foulness ; life is a blotch of labour , like insects scurrying in filth , so that your collier can have a pianoforte in his parlour , and you can have a butler and a motor - car in your up - to - date house , and as a nation we can sport the Ritz , or the Empire , Gaby Deslys and the Sunday newspapers . It is very dreary . '
22849	22862	22863	22863	he	264	' Would you have us live without houses - return to nature ? '
22866	22905	22722	22722	Birkin	179	' I would have nothing at all . People only do what they want to do - and what they are capable of doing . If they were capable of anything else , there would be something else . '
22920	22956	22910	22910	He	264	' Do n't you think the collier 's PIANOFORTE , as you call it , is a symbol for something very real , a real desire for something higher , in the collier 's life ? '
22957	22960	22962	22962	Birkin	179	' Higher ! '
22964	23096	22962	22962	Birkin	179	' Yes . Amazing heights of upright grandeur . It makes him so much higher in his neighbouring collier 's eyes . He sees himself reflected in the neighbouring opinion , like in a Brocken mist , several feet taller on the strength of the pianoforte , and he is satisfied . He lives for the sake of that Brocken spectre , the reflection of himself in the human opinion . You do the same . If you are of high importance to humanity you are of high importance to yourself . That is why you work so hard at the mines . If you can produce coal to cook five thousand dinners a day , you are five thousand times more important than if you cooked only your own dinner . '
23097	23103	23105	23105	Gerald	264	' I suppose I am , '
23107	23113	23115	23115	Birkin	179	' Ca n't you see , '
23117	23173	23115	23115	Birkin	179	' that to help my neighbour to eat is no more than eating myself . " I eat , thou eatest , he eats , we eat , you eat , they eat " - and what then ? Why should every man decline the whole verb . First person singular is enough for me . '
23174	23184	23186	23186	Gerald	264	' You 've got to start with material things , '
23193	23204	23115	23115	Birkin	179	' And we 've got to live for SOMETHING , we 're
23217	23220	23115	23115	Birkin	179	' said Gerald .
23221	23225	23227	23227	Birkin	179	' Tell me , '
23229	23236	23227	23227	Birkin	179	' What do you live for ? '
23243	23250	23251	23251	he	264	' What do I live for ? '
23254	23287	23251	23251	he	264	' I suppose I live to work , to produce something , in so far as I am a purposive being . Apart from that , I live because I am living . '
23288	23342	23399	23399	he	264	' And what 's your work ? Getting so many more thousands of tons of coal out of the earth every day . And when we 've got all the coal we want , and all the plush furniture , and pianofortes , and the rabbits are all stewed and eaten , and we 're
23352	23382	23450	23450	Birkin	179	're listening to the young lady performing on the pianoforte - what then ? What then , when you 've made a real fair start with your material things ? '
23404	23412	23413	23413	he	264	' We have n't got there yet , '
23416	23434	23399	23399	he	264	' A good many people are still waiting for the rabbit and the fire to cook it . '
23435	23448	23450	23450	Birkin	179	' So while you get the coal I must chase the rabbit ? '
23456	23461	23463	23463	Gerald	264	' Something like that , '
23496	23499	23500	23500	he	835	' Gerald , '
23503	23509	23500	23500	he	835	' I rather hate you . '
23510	23516	23518	23518	Gerald	264	' I know you do , '
23520	23525	23518	23518	Gerald	264	' Why do you ? '
23533	23547	23548	23548	he	835	' I should like to know if you are conscious of hating me , '
23553	23577	23548	23548	he	835	' Do you ever consciously detest me - hate me with mystic hate ? There are odd moments when I hate you starrily . '
23598	23609	23610	23610	he	264	' I may , of course , hate you sometimes , '
23613	23616	23610	23610	he	264	' But I 'm
23631	23631	23610	23610	he	264	'
23632	23638	23640	23640	Birkin	179	' So much the worse , '
23657	23666	23667	23667	he	835	' So much the worse , is it ? '
23744	23760	23761	23761	he	835	' What do you think is the aim and object of your life , Gerald ? '
23789	23802	23803	23803	he	835	' At this moment , I could n't say off - hand , '
23811	23829	23830	23830	Birkin	179	' Do you think love is the be - all and the end - all of life ? '
23839	23845	23847	23847	Gerald	264	' Of my own life ? '
23849	23852	23910	23910	Birkin	179	' Yes . '
23860	23866	23868	23868	Gerald	264	' I ca n't say , '
23870	23879	23868	23868	Gerald	264	' It has n't been , so far . '
23880	23890	23910	23910	Birkin	179	' What has your life been , so far ? '
23891	23909	23868	23868	Gerald	264	' Oh - finding out things for myself - and getting experiences - and making things GO . '
23919	23923	23924	23924	he	835	' I find , '
23927	23957	23924	23924	he	835	' that one needs some one REALLY pure single activity - I should call love a single pure activity . But I DON'T really love anybody - not now . '
23958	23966	23968	23968	Gerald	264	' Have you ever really loved anybody ? '
23970	23975	23977	23977	Birkin	179	' Yes and no , '
23979	23983	23985	23985	Gerald	264	' Not finally ? '
23987	23994	23996	23996	Birkin	179	' Finally - finally - no , '
23998	24002	24004	24004	Gerald	264	' Nor I , '
24006	24013	24015	24015	Birkin	179	' And do you want to ? '
24036	24042	24043	24043	he	264	' I do n't know , '
24046	24055	24057	24057	Birkin	179	' I do - I want to love , '
24059	24063	24057	24057	Birkin	179	' You do ? '
24064	24074	24086	24086	he	264	' Yes . I want the finality of love . '
24075	24081	24083	24083	Gerald	264	' The finality of love , '
24092	24097	24098	24098	he	264	' Just one woman ? '
24131	24137	24139	24139	Birkin	179	' Yes , one woman , '
24155	24175	24177	24177	Gerald	264	' I do n't believe a woman , and nothing but a woman , will ever make my life , '
24179	24196	24198	24198	Birkin	179	' Not the centre and core of it - the love between you and a woman ? '
24216	24225	24226	24226	he	264	' I never quite feel it that way , '
24229	24243	24210	24210	he	264	' You do n't ? Then wherein does life centre , for you ? '
24244	24285	24286	24286	Birkin	179	' I do n't know - that 's what I want somebody to tell me . As far as I can make out , it does n't centre at all . It is artificially held TOGETHER by the social mechanism . '
24295	24299	24300	24300	he	264	' I know , '
24303	24347	24300	24300	he	264	' it just does n't centre . The old ideals are dead as nails - nothing there . It seems to me there remains only this perfect union with a woman - sort of ultimate marriage - and there is n't anything else . '
24348	24363	24365	24365	Gerald	264	' And you mean if there is n't the woman , there 's nothing ? '
24367	24378	24300	24300	he	264	' Pretty well that - seeing there 's no God . '
24379	24382	24300	24300	he	264	' Then we 're
24388	24407	24300	24300	he	264	' said Gerald . And he turned to look out of the window at the flying , golden landscape .
24429	24438	24440	24440	Birkin	179	' You think its heavy odds against us ? '
24442	24468	24470	24470	Gerald	264	' If we 've got to make our life up out of a woman , one woman , woman only , yes , I do , '
24472	24489	24470	24470	Gerald	264	' I do n't believe I shall ever make up MY life , at that rate . '
24496	24503	24504	24504	he	264	' You are a born unbeliever , '
24507	24515	24517	24517	Gerald	264	' I only feel what I feel , '
24569	24578	24579	24579	he	264	' It troubles me very much , Gerald , '
24586	24593	24595	24595	Gerald	264	' I can see it does , '
24804	24971	24790	24790	Birkin	179	' Well , if mankind is destroyed , if our race is destroyed like Sodom , and there is this beautiful evening with the luminous land and trees , I am satisfied . That which informs it all is there , and can never be lost . After all , what is mankind but just one expression of the incomprehensible . And if mankind passes away , it will only mean that this particular expression is completed and done . That which is expressed , and that which is to be expressed , can not be diminished . There it is , in the shining evening . Let mankind pass away - time it did . The creative utterances will not cease , they will only be there . Humanity does n't embody the utterance of the incomprehensible any more . Humanity is a dead letter . There will be a new embodiment , in a new way . Let humanity disappear as quick as possible . '
24978	24986	24972	24972	Gerald	264	' Where are you staying in London ? '
24991	25015	24987	24987	Birkin	179	' With a man in Soho . I pay part of the rent of a flat , and stop there when I like . '
25016	25029	25031	25031	Gerald	264	' Good idea - have a place more or less your own , '
25033	25046	24987	24987	Birkin	179	' Yes . But I do n't care for it much . I 'm

25059	25065	24987	24987	Birkin	179	' What kind of people ? '
25066	25128	25031	25031	Gerald	264	' Art - music - London Bohemia - the most pettifogging calculating Bohemia that ever reckoned its pennies . But there are a few decent people , decent in some respects . They are really very thorough rejecters of the world - perhaps they live only in the gesture of rejection and negation - but negatively something , at any rate . '
25129	25139	24987	24987	Birkin	179	' What are they ? - painters , musicians ? '
25140	25196	25031	25031	Gerald	264	' Painters , musicians , writers - hangers - on , models , advanced young people , anybody who is openly at outs with the conventions , and belongs to nowhere particularly . They are often young fellows down from the University , and girls who are living their own lives , as they say . '
25197	25201	25203	25203	Gerald	264	' All loose ? '
25212	25233	25031	25031	Gerald	264	' In one way . Most bound , in another . For all their shockingness , all on one note . '
25306	25325	25327	25327	Gerald	264	' We might see something of each other - I am in London for two or three days , '
25329	25332	25334	25334	Birkin	179	' Yes , '
25336	25373	25334	25334	Birkin	179	' I do n't want to go to the theatre , or the music hall - you 'd better come round to the flat , and see what you can make of Halliday and his crowd . '
25374	25382	25384	25384	Gerald	264	' Thanks - I should like to , '
25386	25393	25384	25384	Gerald	264	' What are you doing tonight ? '
25394	25416	25334	25334	Birkin	179	' I promised to meet Halliday at the Pompadour . It 's a bad place , but there is nowhere else . '
25417	25422	25424	25424	Gerald	264	' Where is it ? '
25426	25430	25334	25334	Birkin	179	' Piccadilly Circus . '
25431	25443	25334	25334	Birkin	179	' Oh yes - well , shall I come round there ? '
25444	25454	25334	25334	Birkin	179	' By all means , it might amuse you . '
25505	25520	25521	25521	he	264	' " Where the quiet coloured end of evening smiles Miles and miles - " '
25554	25560	25534	25534	Gerald	264	' What were you saying ? '
25571	25597	25561	25561	Birkin	179	' " Where the quiet coloured end of evening smiles , Miles and miles , Over pastures where the something something sheep Half asleep - " '
25624	25656	25607	25607	Birkin	179	' I always feel doomed when the train is running into London . I feel such a despair , so hopeless , as if it were the end of the world . '
25657	25660	25662	25662	Gerald	264	' Really ! '
25664	25675	25662	25662	Gerald	264	' And does the end of the world frighten you ? '
25685	25691	25692	25692	he	264	' I do n't know , '
25695	25718	25692	25692	he	264	' It does while it hangs imminent and does n't fall . But people give me a bad feeling - very bad . '
25730	25734	25735	25735	he	264	' Do they ? '
25815	25826	25828	25828	Birkin	179	' Do n't you feel like one of the damned ? '
25849	25852	25854	25854	Gerald	264	' No , '
25856	25862	25864	25864	Birkin	179	' It is real death , '
26232	26241	26216	26217	Miss Darrington	215	' Wo n't you have some more - ? '
26242	26245	26246	26246	she	215	' Brandy , '
26263	26266	26267	26267	she	215	' No , '

26335	26347	26349	26350	the girl	559	' He 's doing a private show at Lady Snellgrove 's , '
26352	26358	26349	26350	the girl	559	' Warens is there too . '
26364	26369	26371	26371	Birkin	179	' Well , then , '
26379	26387	26371	26371	Birkin	179	' what do you intend to do ? '
26398	26407	26408	26408	she	559	' I do n't intend to do anything , '
26411	26420	26408	26408	she	559	' I shall look for some sittings tomorrow . '
26421	26428	26430	26430	Birkin	179	' Who shall you go to ? '
26432	26453	26388	26389	The girl	559	' I shall go to Bentley 's first . But I believe he 's angwy with me for running away . '
26454	26461	26388	26389	The girl	559	' That is from the Madonna ? '
26462	26483	26388	26389	The girl	559	' Yes . And then if he does n't want me , I know I can get work with Carmarthen . '
26484	26487	26388	26389	The girl	559	' Carmarthen ? '
26488	26496	26388	26389	The girl	559	' Lord Carmarthen - he does photographs . '
26497	26502	26388	26389	The girl	559	' Chiffon and shoulders - '
26503	26512	26388	26389	The girl	559	' Yes . But he 's awfully decent . '
26518	26529	26530	26530	he	1021	' And what are you going to do about Julius ? '
26533	26536	26537	26537	she	179	' Nothing , '
26540	26547	26537	26537	she	179	' I shall just ignore him . '
26548	26556	26558	26558	she	179	' You 've done with him altogether ? '
26582	26595	26596	26596	he	1022	' Hallo Birkin ! Hallo PUSSUM , when did you come back ? '
26600	26603	26572	26574	Another young man	1022	' Today . '
26604	26609	26537	26537	she	179	' Does Halliday know ? '
26610	26622	26572	26574	Another young man	1022	' I do n't know . I do n't care either . '
26623	26650	26537	26537	she	179	' Ha - ha ! The wind still sits in that quarter , does it ? Do you mind if I come over to this table ? '
26651	26653	26572	26574	Another young man	1022	' I 'm
26662	26674	26656	26656	Wupert	222	' she replied , coolly and yet appealingly , like a child .
26675	26686	26688	26690	the young man	687	' Open confession - good for the soul , eh ? '
26692	26698	26688	26690	the young man	687	' Well , so long . '
26760	26768	26769	26770	the girl	559	' Are you staying at the flat ? '
26776	26781	26783	26783	Birkin	179	' For three days , '
26785	26789	26783	26783	Birkin	179	' And you ? '
26790	26805	26812	26813	the girl	559	' I do n't know yet . I can always go to Bertha 's . '
26855	26862	26812	26813	the girl	559	' Do you know London well ? '
26863	26869	26870	26870	he	264	' I can hardly say , '
26873	26892	26870	26870	he	264	' I 've been up a good many times , but I was never in this place before . '
26893	26895	26812	26813	the girl	559	' You 're
26902	26914	26812	26813	the girl	559	' she said , in a tone that placed him an outsider .
26915	26918	26919	26919	he	264	' No , '
26922	26938	26940	26940	Birkin	179	' He 's a soldier , and an explorer , and a Napoleon of industry , '
26949	26955	26957	26958	the girl	559	' Are you a soldier ? '
26967	26975	26977	26977	Gerald	264	' No , I resigned my commission , '
26979	26984	26977	26977	Gerald	264	' some years ago . '
26985	26993	26995	26995	Birkin	179	' He was in the last war , '
26997	27002	27004	27005	the girl	559	' Were you really ? '
27007	27015	27017	27017	Birkin	179	' And then he explored the Amazon , '
27019	27030	27017	27017	Birkin	179	' and now he is ruling over coal - mines . '
27094	27101	27102	27102	she	559	' How long are you staying ? '
27106	27112	27113	27113	he	264	' A day or two , '
27116	27124	27113	27113	he	264	' But there is no particular hurry . '
27462	27467	27469	27469	he	264	' There 's Julius ! '
27616	27625	27601	27601	He	1042	' Pussum , what are YOU doing here ? '
27682	27689	27691	27691	Halliday	213	' Why have you come back ? '
27701	27710	27691	27691	Halliday	213	' I told you not to come back . '
27746	27761	27763	27763	Birkin	179	' You know you wanted her to come back - come and sit down , '
27767	27795	27711	27712	The girl	559	' No I did n't want her to come back , and I told her not to come back . What have you come for , Pussum ? '
27796	27802	27803	27803	she	559	' For nothing from YOU , '
27812	27822	27824	27824	Halliday	213	' Then why have you come back at ALL ? '
27835	27842	27844	27844	Birkin	179	' She comes as she likes , '
27846	27859	27844	27844	Birkin	179	' Are you going to sit down , or are you not ? '
27860	27871	27873	27873	Halliday	213	' No , I wo n't sit down with Pussum , '
27875	27888	27889	27889	she	559	' I wo n't hurt you , you need n't be afraid , '
27929	27957	27911	27911	Halliday	213	' Oh , it 's given me such a turn ! Pussum , I wish you would n't do these things . Why did you come back ? '
27958	27965	27966	27966	she	559	' Not for anything from you , '
27969	27976	27977	27977	he	213	' You 've said that before , '
28004	28015	28016	28016	she	559	' Were you ever vewy much afwaid of the savages ? '
28026	28038	27984	27984	She	559	' No - never very much afraid . On the whole they 're
28042	28063	27984	27984	She	559	're not born yet , you ca n't feel really afraid of them . You know you can manage them . '
28064	28075	28041	28041	they	1048	' Do you weally ? Are n't they very fierce ? '
28076	28114	27984	27984	She	559	' Not very . There are n't many fierce things , as a matter of fact . There are n't many things , neither people nor animals , that have it in them to be really dangerous . '
28115	28120	28122	28122	Birkin	179	' Except in herds , '
28124	28130	28131	28131	she	559	' Are n't there really ? '
28134	28156	28131	28131	she	559	' Oh , I thought savages were all so dangerous , they 'd have your life before you could look round . '
28157	28161	28162	28162	he	1049	' Did you ? '
28165	28175	28162	28162	he	1049	' They are over - rated , savages . They 're

28191	28208	28131	28131	she	559	' Oh , it 's not so very wonderfully brave then , to be an explorer ? '
28209	28223	28162	28162	he	1049	' No . It 's more a question of hardships than of terrors . '
28224	28234	28131	28131	she	559	' Oh ! And were n't you ever afraid ? '
28235	28248	28162	28162	he	1049	' In my life ? I do n't know . Yes , I 'm
28268	28277	28131	28131	she	559	'm afraid of being bound hand and foot . '
28553	28561	28541	28541	Gerald	264	' Where have you come back from ? '
28562	28567	28569	28569	Pussum	221	' From the country , '
28636	28646	28647	28647	he	264	' And what has Halliday to do with it ? '
28669	28727	28664	28664	she	559	' He made me go and live with him , and now he wants to throw me over . And yet he wo n't let me go to anybody else . He wants me to live hidden in the country . And then he says I persecute him , that he ca n't get rid of me . '
28728	28736	28738	28738	Gerald	264	' Does n't know his own mind , '
28740	28754	28755	28755	she	1053	' He has n't any mind , so he ca n't know it , '
28758	28794	28755	28755	she	1053	' He waits for what somebody tells him to do . He never does anything he wants to do himself - because he does n't know what he wants . He 's a perfect baby . '
28840	28852	28853	28853	Gerald	264	' But he has no hold over you , has he ? '
28856	28875	28876	28876	she	1056	' You see he MADE me go and live with him , when I did n't want to , '
28879	28939	28946	28946	he	1058	' He came and cried to me , tears , you never saw so many , saying HE COULDN'T bear it unless I went back to him . And he would n't go away , he would have stayed for ever . He made me go back . Then every time he behaves in this fashion . And now I 'm
28976	28985	28946	28946	he	1058	'm not going to do it , after - '
28995	29004	29005	29005	he	264	' Are you going to have a child ? '
29074	29077	29078	29078	she	0	' Yes , '

29303	29335	29241	29241	he	264	' she replied , and she sprinkled the last drops of her liqueur over his face . He gave an odd squeal . She sat looking at him , as if indifferent .
29336	29345	29346	29346	he	264	' Pussum , why do you do that ? '
29407	29411	29413	29414	another man	5497	' But Pussum , '
29425	29433	29413	29414	another man	5497	' you promised not to hurt him . '

29745	29814	29916	29917	the girl	559	' said the Pussum , looking up suddenly and staring with her black eyes , on which there seemed an unseeing film of flame , fully upon Gerald . He laughed dangerously , from the blood . Her childish speech caressed his nerves , and her burning , filmed eyes , turned now full upon him , oblivious of all her antecedents , gave him a sort of licence .
29815	29817	29916	29917	the girl	559	' I 'm
29820	29824	29825	29825	I	0	' she protested . '
29826	29840	29841	29841	she	0	'm not afraid of other things . But black - beetles - ugh ! '
29856	29861	29863	29863	Gerald	264	' Do you mean , '
29876	29908	29863	29863	Gerald	264	' that you are afraid of the sight of a black - beetle , or you are afraid of a black - beetle biting you , or doing you some harm ? '
29909	29914	29916	29917	the girl	559	' Do they bite ? '
29919	29924	29926	29926	Halliday	213	' How perfectly loathsome ! '
29928	29934	29936	29936	Gerald	264	' I do n't know , '
29943	29971	29936	29936	Gerald	264	' Do black - beetles bite ? But that is n't the point . Are you afraid of their biting , or is it a metaphysical antipathy ? '
29986	29992	29972	29973	The girl	559	' Oh , I think they 're
29996	29999	30000	30000	she	0	're horrid , '

30354	30358	30360	30360	Gerald	264	' Stop that , '
30403	30413	30415	30415	Halliday	213	' Oh , how horrible , take it away ! '
30424	30429	30431	30434	the sardonic young man	1079	' D'you feel ill ? '
30440	30488	30431	30434	the sardonic young man	1079	' Do you feel ill , Julius ? Garn , it 's nothing , man , do n't give her the pleasure of letting her think she 's performed a feat - do n't give her the satisfaction , man - it 's just what she wants . '

30587	30592	30594	30594	Gerald	264	' Who is he ? '
30596	30610	30571	30572	the Pussum	221	' He 's a Jew , really . I ca n't bear him . '
30611	30626	30571	30572	the Pussum	221	' Well , he 's quite unimportant . But what 's wrong with Halliday ? '
30627	30639	30640	30640	she	1082	' Julius 's the most awful coward you 've ever seen , '
30643	30659	30640	30640	she	1082	' He always faints if I lift a knife - he 's tewwified of me . '

30858	30875	30856	30856	Wupert	222	' she said to him , with a slight insolence , being safe with the other man .

30893	30905	30890	30890	he	213	' I wish you would n't do these things - Oh ! '

30928	30934	30935	30935	he	213	' I WILL go home , '
30938	30956	30957	30957	he	213	' But wo n't you all come along . Wo n't you come round to the flat ? '

31002	31021	30998	30998	he	213	' Oh I do feel - perfectly ghastly ! Pussum , you see what you do to me . '
31022	31031	31032	31032	she	1090	' Then why are you such an idiot ? '

31131	31165	31124	31124	she	1090	' I tell you it is n't drink - it 's your disgusting behaviour , Pussum , it 's nothing else . Oh , how awful ! Libidnikov , do let us go . '
31166	31178	31186	31188	the young Russian	1073	' He 's only drunk one glass - only one glass , '

31695	31774	31808	31809	The Hindu	1115	' Oh yes - that 's because he 's dressed in another man 's clothes . He 's anything but a swell , really . We found him in the road , starving . So I took him here , and another man gave him clothes . He 's anything but what he seems to be - his only advantage is that he ca n't speak English and ca n't understand it , so he 's perfectly safe . '
31775	31781	31783	31785	the young Russian	1073	' He 's very dirty , '
31799	31804	31806	31806	Halliday	213	' What is it ? '

31872	31875	31878	31878	his	213	' What ? '
31881	31910	31878	31878	his	213	' What ? What do you say ? Tell me again . What ? Want money ? Want MORE money ? But what do you want money for ? '
31936	31968	31969	31969	He	213	' He says he wants money to buy underclothing . Can anybody lend me a shilling ? Oh thanks , a shilling will do to buy all the underclothes he wants . '
31989	32018	31986	31986	him	213	' You ca n't want more money , you had three and six yesterday . You must n't ask for any more . Bring the tea in quickly . '
32178	32185	32186	32186	he	264	' Are n't they rather obscene ? '

32203	32218	32199	32201	the other rapidly	1132	' I have never defined the obscene . I think they are very good . '

32456	32472	32453	32453	she	221	' I only came because the others wanted me to , not for your sake . '
32473	32515	32430	32430	Halliday	213	' My dear Pussum , you know you are your own mistress . I do n't want you to do anything but use the flat for your own convenience - you know it , I 've told you so many times . '
32647	32649	32638	32638	Birkin	179	' I 'm
32654	32658	32659	32659	Gerald	264	' he said . '

32680	32683	32685	32685	Gerald	264	' Right , '
32708	32721	32698	32698	Halliday	213	' I say , wo n't you stay here - oh do ! '
32722	32730	32732	32732	Gerald	264	' You ca n't put everybody up , '
32734	32781	32698	32698	Halliday	213	' Oh but I can , perfectly - there are three more beds besides mine - do stay , wo n't you . Everything is quite ready - there is always somebody here - I always put people up - I love having the house crowded . '
32782	32790	32792	32793	the Pussum	1080	' But there are only two rooms , '
32802	32808	32792	32793	the Pussum	1080	' now Rupert 's here . '
32809	32818	32820	32820	Halliday	213	' I know there are only two rooms , '
32831	32838	32823	32823	his	213	' But what does that matter ? '
32855	32864	32866	32867	the Russian	1146	' Julius and I will share one room , '
32883	32889	32891	32891	Gerald	264	' It 's very simple , '
33015	33021	33007	33007	Maxim	225	' That 's all right . '
33037	33044	33022	33022	He	225	' That 's all right - you 're
33048	33048	33022	33022	He	225	'
33095	33101	33103	33103	Gerald	264	' I'M all right then , '
33105	33111	33161	33161	her	221	' Yes ! Yes ! You 're
33115	33119	33103	33103	Gerald	264	' said the Russian .
33149	33159	33161	33161	her	221	' I know you want to catch me out , '
33168	33186	33161	33161	her	221	' But I do n't care , I do n't care how much you catch me out . '
33398	33403	33404	33404	he	213	' Good - morning , '
33407	33415	33404	33404	he	213	' Oh - did you want towels ? '
33459	33472	33473	33473	he	264	' Do n't you love to feel the fire on your skin ? '
33476	33482	33484	33484	Gerald	264	' It IS rather pleasant , '
33486	33506	33508	33508	Halliday	213	' How perfectly splendid it must be to be in a climate where one could do without clothing altogether , '
33510	33513	33515	33515	Gerald	264	' Yes , '
33517	33530	33515	33515	Gerald	264	' if there were n't so many things that sting and bite . '
33531	33537	33539	33539	Maxim	225	' That 's a disadvantage , '
33671	33675	33677	33677	Maxim	225	' Of course , '
33679	33693	33677	33677	Maxim	225	' you 've been in hot countries where the people go about naked . '
33694	33698	33700	33700	Halliday	213	' Oh really ! '
33702	33705	33700	33700	Halliday	213	' Where ? '
33706	33712	33714	33714	Gerald	264	' South America - Amazon , '
33716	33764	33700	33700	Halliday	213	' Oh but how perfectly splendid ! It 's one of the things I want most to do - to live from day to day without EVER putting on any sort of clothing whatever . If I could do that , I should feel I had lived . '
33765	33769	33771	33771	Gerald	264	' But why ? '
33773	33785	33771	33771	Gerald	264	' I ca n't see that it makes so much difference . '
33786	33798	33700	33700	Halliday	213	' Oh , I think it would be perfectly splendid . I 'm
33814	33814	33700	33700	Halliday	213	'
33815	33819	33821	33821	Gerald	264	' But why ? '
33823	33828	33821	33821	Gerald	264	' Why should it ? '
33829	33869	33700	33700	Halliday	213	' Oh - one would FEEL things instead of merely looking at them . I should feel the air move against me , and feel the things I touched , instead of having only to look at them . I 'm
33898	33905	33700	33700	Halliday	213	'm sure that is entirely wrong . '
33906	33917	33919	33920	the Russian	228	' Yes , that is true , that is true , '
34046	34060	34061	34061	he	228	' There 's the bath - room now , if you want it , '
34075	34081	34072	34072	Gerald	264	' I say , Rupert ! '
34082	34085	34086	34089	The single white figure	1164	' What ? '
34099	34114	34115	34115	Gerald	264	' What do you think of that figure there ? I want to know , '
34164	34169	34171	34171	Birkin	179	' It is art , '
34173	34182	34184	34185	the Russian	228	' Very beautiful , it 's very beautiful , '
34326	34332	34333	34333	Gerald	264	' Why is it art ? '
34340	34347	34349	34349	Birkin	179	' It conveys a complete truth , '
34351	34367	34349	34349	Birkin	179	' It contains the whole truth of that state , whatever you feel about it . '
34368	34378	34380	34380	Gerald	264	' But you ca n't call it HIGH art , '
34382	34416	34349	34349	Birkin	179	' High ! There are centuries and hundreds of centuries of development in a straight line , behind that carving ; it is an awful pitch of culture , of a definite sort . '
34417	34421	34422	34422	Gerald	264	' What culture ? '
34435	34468	34349	34349	Birkin	179	' Pure culture in sensation , culture in the physical consciousness , really ultimate PHYSICAL consciousness , mindless , utterly sensual . It is so sensual as to be final , supreme . '
34486	34495	34496	34496	he	264	' You like the wrong things , Rupert , '
34499	34504	34496	34496	he	264	' things against yourself . '
34505	34516	34517	34517	Birkin	179	' Oh , I know , this is n't everything , '
34647	34653	34654	34654	he	264	' You are awake now , '
34659	34665	34667	34667	her	221	' What time is it ? '
35952	35958	35960	35960	Gudrun	352	' Is n't it complete ! '
35962	35972	35973	35973	She	177	' It is as final as an old aquatint . '
35998	36004	36006	36006	Ursula	264	' Do you love it ? '
36008	36027	35979	35979	her	177	' I do n't LOVE it , but in its way , I think it is quite complete . '
36087	36093	36083	36083	her	177	' Here you are - I 'm
36100	36105	36083	36083	her	177	' she kissed Gudrun - '

36149	36156	36158	36158	Gudrun	352	' Not at all , thanks , '
36160	36163	36165	36165	Hermione	177	' No - '
36206	36210	36212	36212	Hermione	177	' Come in , '
36377	36402	36365	36365	her	177	' You would like to see your rooms now , would n't you ! Yes . We will go up now , shall we ? '
36951	36956	36961	36961	her	177	' There 's Salsie ! '
36994	36999	37001	37001	Gudrun	352	' Who is it ? '
37003	37021	37023	37024	Sir Joshua	236	' Mr Roddice - Miss Roddice 's brother - at least , I suppose it 's he , '
37026	37036	37043	37043	her	1261	' Salsie , yes , it is her brother , '
37272	37276	37278	37278	Hermione	177	' Of course , '
37287	37309	37281	37281	her	177	' there CAN be no reason , no EXCUSE for education , except the joy and beauty of knowledge in itself . '
37327	37340	37324	37324	she	177	' Vocational education ISN'T education , it is the close of education . '
37359	37363	37364	37364	he	264	' Not necessarily , '
37367	37395	37364	37364	he	264	' But is n't education really like gymnastics , is n't the end of education the production of a well - trained , vigorous , energetic mind ? '
37396	37409	37411	37412	Miss Bradley	234	' Just as athletics produce a healthy body , ready for anything , '
37426	37429	37431	37431	Hermione	177	' Well - '
37433	37475	37431	37431	Hermione	177	' I do n't know . To me the pleasure of knowing is so great , so WONDERFUL - nothing has meant so much to me in all life , as certain knowledge - no , I am sure - nothing . '
37476	37485	37487	37487	Alexander	241	' What knowledge , for example , Hermione ? '
37496	37536	37491	37491	her	177	' M - m - m - I do n't know . . . But one thing was the stars , when I really understood something about the stars . One feels so UPLIFTED , so UNBOUNDED . . . '
37546	37556	37557	37557	he	264	' What do you want to feel unbounded for ? '
37561	37570	37557	37557	he	264	' You do n't want to BE unbounded . '
37576	37587	37589	37589	Gerald	264	' Yes , but one does have that limitless feeling , '
37591	37606	37589	37589	Gerald	264	' It 's like getting on top of the mountain and seeing the Pacific . '
37607	37615	37617	37618	the Italian	1275	' Silent upon a peak in Dariayn , '
37630	37636	37638	37638	Gerald	264	' Not necessarily in Dariayn , '
37661	37686	37656	37656	she	177	' Yes , it is the greatest thing in life - to KNOW . It is really to be happy , to be FREE . '

37783	37806	37780	37780	he	1276	' of things concluded , in the past . It 's like bottling the liberty of last summer in the bottled gooseberries . '

37824	37843	37819	37820	the Baronet	1276	' Could we call our knowledge of the laws of gravitation for instance , knowledge of the past ? '

37917	37932	37933	37933	she	1279	' Bazarov came to the door and threw his eyes hurriedly down the street , '
37963	37969	37971	37971	Alexander	241	' What is the book ? '
37975	37983	37985	37987	the little foreigner	1280	' Fathers and Sons , by Turgenev , '
38004	38010	38012	38012	Birkin	179	' An old American edition , '

38036	38049	38028	38028	Alexander	241	' Bazarov ouvra la porte et jeta les yeux dans la rue . '
38057	38067	38069	38069	Ursula	264	' I wonder what the " hurriedly " was , '
38115	38125	38127	38127	Hermione	177	' Would you like to come for a walk ? '
38155	38165	38127	38127	Hermione	177	' Will you come for a walk , Rupert ? '
38166	38171	38127	38127	Hermione	177	' No , Hermione . '
38172	38178	38127	38127	Hermione	177	' But are you SURE ? '
38179	38183	38127	38127	Hermione	177	' Quite sure . '
38191	38196	38198	38198	Hermione	177	' And why not ? '
38231	38243	38244	38244	he	1286	' Because I do n't like trooping off in a gang , '

38933	38952	38918	38918	she	177	' Yes . How beautifully you do it ! You like it very much , do n't you ? '
38953	38960	38961	38961	he	1303	' It 's a marvellous drawing , '

39019	39026	39010	39010	she	177	' Why not do something original ? '
39027	39034	39035	39035	he	1303	' I want to know it , '
39038	39055	39035	39035	he	1303	' One gets more of China , copying this picture , than reading all the books . '
39056	39063	39070	39070	she	177	' And what do you get ? '
39127	39193	39124	39124	he	1303	' I know what centres they live from - what they perceive and feel - the hot , stinging centrality of a goose in the flux of cold water and mud - the curious bitter stinging heat of a goose 's blood , entering their own blood like an inoculation of corruptive fire - fire of the cold - burning mud - the lotus mystery . '
39298	39301	39302	39302	she	177	' Yes , '
39316	39319	39302	39302	she	177	' Yes , '

41247	41254	41255	41255	Gerald	264	' Who are those two Brangwens ? '
41258	41264	41220	41220	Gerald	264	' They live in Beldover . '
41265	41274	41220	41220	Gerald	264	' In Beldover ! Who are they then ? '
41275	41282	41220	41220	Gerald	264	' Teachers in the Grammar School . '
41288	41292	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' They are ! '
41298	41307	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' I thought I had seen them before . '
41308	41313	41315	41315	Birkin	179	' It disappoints you ? '
41317	41332	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' Disappoints me ! No - but how is it Hermione has them here ? '
41333	41363	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' She knew Gudrun in London - that 's the younger one , the one with the darker hair - she 's an artist - does sculpture and modelling . '
41364	41381	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' She 's not a teacher in the Grammar School , then - only the other ? '
41382	41394	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' Both - Gudrun art mistress , Ursula a class mistress . '
41395	41402	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' And what 's the father ? '
41403	41410	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' Handicraft instructor in the schools . '
41411	41414	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' Really ! '
41415	41423	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' Class - barriers are breaking down ! '
41437	41455	41294	41294	Gerald	264	' That their father is handicraft instructor in a school ! What does it matter to me ? '
41485	41518	41520	41520	Birkin	179	' I do n't suppose you will see very much more of Gudrun , at least . She is a restless bird , she 'll be gone in a week or two , '
41522	41528	41520	41520	Birkin	179	' Where will she go ? '
41529	41578	41456	41456	Birkin	179	' London , Paris , Rome - heaven knows . I always expect her to sheer off to Damascus or San Francisco ; she 's a bird of paradise . God knows what she 's got to do with Beldover . It goes by contraries , like dreams . '
41586	41595	41596	41596	he	264	' How do you know her so well ? '
41599	41606	41607	41607	he	264	' I knew her in London , '
41610	41662	41607	41607	he	264	' in the Algernon Strange set . She 'll know about Pussum and Libidnikov and the rest - even if she does n't know them personally . She was never quite that set - more conventional , in a way . I 've known her for two years , I suppose . '
41663	41674	41676	41676	Gerald	264	' And she makes money , apart from her teaching ? '
41678	41695	41456	41456	Birkin	179	' Some - irregularly . She can sell her models . She has a certain reclame . '
41696	41701	41456	41456	Birkin	179	' How much for ? '
41702	41709	41456	41456	Birkin	179	' A guinea , ten guineas . '
41710	41720	41456	41456	Birkin	179	' And are they good ? What are they ? '
41721	41755	41456	41456	Birkin	179	' I think sometimes they are marvellously good . That is hers , those two wagtails in Hermione 's boudoir - you 've seen them - they are carved in wood and painted . '
41756	41765	41456	41456	Birkin	179	' I thought it was savage carving again . '
41766	41810	41456	41456	Birkin	179	' No , hers . That 's what they are - animals and birds , sometimes odd small people in everyday dress , really rather wonderful when they come off . They have a sort of funniness that is quite unconscious and subtle . '
41811	41823	41825	41825	Gerald	264	' She might be a well - known artist one day ? '
41827	41919	41825	41825	Gerald	264	' She might . But I think she wo n't . She drops her art if anything else catches her . Her contrariness prevents her taking it seriously - she must never be too serious , she feels she might give herself away . And she wo n't give herself away - she 's always on the defensive . That 's what I ca n't stand about her type . By the way , how did things go off with Pussum after I left you ? I have n't heard anything . '
41920	41950	41456	41456	Birkin	179	' Oh , rather disgusting . Halliday turned objectionable , and I only just saved myself from jumping in his stomach , in a real old - fashioned row . '
41955	41959	41960	41960	he	1364	' Of course , '
41963	42066	41960	41960	he	1364	' Julius is somewhat insane . On the one hand he 's had religious mania , and on the other , he is fascinated by obscenity . Either he is a pure servant , washing the feet of Christ , or else he is making obscene drawings of Jesus - action and reaction - and between the two , nothing . He is really insane . He wants a pure lily , another girl , with a baby face , on the one hand , and on the other , he MUST have the Pussum , just to defile himself with her . '
42067	42077	42079	42079	Gerald	264	' That 's what I ca n't make out , '
42081	42095	42079	42079	Gerald	264	' Does he love her , the Pussum , or does n't he ? '
42096	42174	41960	41960	he	1364	' He neither does nor does n't . She is the harlot , the actual harlot of adultery to him . And he 's got a craving to throw himself into the filth of her . Then he gets up and calls on the name of the lily of purity , the baby - faced girl , and so enjoys himself all round . It 's the old story - action and reaction , and nothing between . '
42175	42181	42183	42183	Gerald	264	' I do n't know , '
42189	42208	42183	42183	Gerald	264	' that he does insult the Pussum so very much . She strikes me as being rather foul . '
42209	42217	42219	42219	Birkin	179	' But I thought you liked her , '
42221	42244	42219	42219	Birkin	179	' I always felt fond of her . I never had anything to do with her , personally , that 's true . '
42245	42258	42260	42260	Gerald	264	' I liked her all right , for a couple of days , '
42262	42303	42260	42260	Gerald	264	' But a week of her would have turned me over . There 's a certain smell about the skin of those women , that in the end is sickening beyond words - even if you like it at first . '
42304	42308	42310	42310	Birkin	179	' I know , '
42319	42334	42313	42313	he	1365	' But go to bed , Gerald . God knows what time it is . '
42367	42371	42372	42372	he	264	' One thing , '
42382	42399	42372	42372	he	264	' We finished up rather stormily , and I never had time to give her anything . '
42400	42403	42405	42405	Birkin	179	' Money ? '
42407	42423	42405	42405	Birkin	179	' She 'll get what she wants from Halliday or from one of her acquaintances . '
42424	42428	42430	42430	Gerald	264	' But then , '
42432	42445	42430	42430	Gerald	264	' I 'd rather give her her dues and settle the account . '
42446	42452	42485	42485	He	264	' She does n't care . '
42453	42476	42430	42430	Gerald	264	' No , perhaps not . But one feels the account is left open , and one would rather it were closed . '
42477	42481	42483	42483	Birkin	179	' Would you ? '
42542	42552	42554	42554	Gerald	264	' I think I 'd rather close the account , '
42560	42570	42572	42572	Birkin	179	' It does n't matter one way or another , '
42574	42583	42585	42585	Gerald	264	' You always say it does n't matter , '
42602	42607	42609	42609	Birkin	179	' Neither does it , '
42611	42621	42597	42599	the other man	835	' But she was a decent sort , really - '
42622	42633	42635	42635	Birkin	179	' Render unto Caesarina the things that are Caesarina 's , '
42653	42668	42669	42669	he	264	' Go away , it wearies me - it 's too late at night , '
42672	42684	42686	42686	Gerald	264	' I wish you 'd tell me something that DID matter , '
42712	42721	42723	42723	Gerald	264	' All right then , go to sleep , '
42757	42770	42753	42753	he	264	' I still think I ought to give the Pussum ten pounds . '
42771	42775	42777	42777	Birkin	179	' Oh God ! '
42779	42811	42777	42777	Birkin	179	' do n't be so matter - of - fact . Close the account in your own soul , if you like . It is there you ca n't close it . '
42812	42821	42753	42753	he	264	' How do you know I ca n't ? '
42822	42826	42777	42777	Birkin	179	' Knowing you . '
42833	42856	42753	42753	he	264	' It seems to me the right thing to do , you know , with the Pussums , is to pay them . '
42857	42888	42890	42890	Birkin	179	' And the right thing for mistresses : keep them . And the right thing for wives : live under the same roof with them . Integer vitae scelerisque purus - '
42892	42903	42905	42905	Gerald	264	' There 's no need to be nasty about it , '
42907	42913	42753	42753	he	264	' It bores me . I 'm
42920	42920	42753	42753	he	264	'
42921	42936	42753	42753	he	264	' And I do n't care whether you are or not - I am . '
43114	43132	43134	43134	Gerald	264	' I ca n't see what you will leave me at all , to be interested in , '
43142	43155	43134	43134	Gerald	264	' Neither the Pussums , nor the mines , nor anything else . '
43156	43169	43191	43191	Gerald	264	' You be interested in what you can , Gerald . Only I 'm
43174	43177	43191	43191	Gerald	264	' said Birkin .
43178	43189	43191	43191	Gerald	264	' What am I to do at all , then ? '
43195	43207	43191	43191	Gerald	264	' What you like . What am I to do myself ? '
43219	43221	43214	43214	Gerald	264	' I 'm
43227	43234	43214	43214	Gerald	264	' came the good - humoured answer .
43235	43239	43241	43241	Birkin	179	' You see , '
43243	43282	43241	43241	Birkin	179	' part of you wants the Pussum , and nothing but the Pussum , part of you wants the mines , the business , and nothing but the business - and there you are - all in bits - '
43283	43292	43294	43294	Gerald	264	' And part of me wants something else , '
43305	43308	43310	43310	Birkin	179	' What ? '
43315	43326	43328	43328	Gerald	264	' That 's what I hoped you could tell me , '
43338	43361	43362	43362	Birkin	179	' I ca n't tell you - I ca n't find my own way , let alone yours . You might marry , '
43365	43371	43373	43373	Gerald	264	' Who - the Pussum ? '
43375	43378	43380	43380	Birkin	179	' Perhaps , '
43391	43397	43399	43399	Gerald	264	' That is your panacea , '
43401	43419	43399	43399	Gerald	264	' But you have n't even tried it on yourself yet , and you are sick enough . '
43420	43424	43426	43426	Birkin	179	' I am , '

43545	43557	43543	43543	Gerald	264	' if it really works . But whom will you marry ? '
43558	43562	43564	43564	Birkin	179	' A woman , '

44346	44349	44351	44351	Joshua	243	' Splendid , '

44608	44614	44606	44606	Hermione	177	' shall we all bathe ? '

44624	44631	44633	44633	Hermione	177	' You do n't want to ? '

44688	44698	44679	44679	Hermione	177	' Will a handkerchief do - a large handkerchief ? '

44708	44713	44715	44715	Hermione	177	' Come along then , '
45124	45136	45138	45138	Gudrun	352	' Are n't they terrifying ? Are n't they really terrifying ? '
45140	45181	45138	45138	Gudrun	352	' Do n't they look saurian ? They are just like great lizards . Did you ever see anything like Sir Joshua ? But really , Ursula , he belongs to the primeval world , when great lizards crawled about . '
45443	45451	45452	45452	he	264	' You do n't like the water ? '
45484	45491	45492	45492	she	352	' I like it very much , '
45504	45509	45495	45495	He	264	' And you swim ? '
45510	45516	45495	45495	He	264	' Yes , I swim . '
45549	45556	45557	45557	he	264	' Why would n't you bathe ? '
45587	45596	45597	45597	she	352	' Because I did n't like the crowd , '
45869	45872	45874	45874	Gudrun	352	' Oh ! '
45876	45938	45874	45874	Gudrun	352	' Then we sha n't have names any more - we shall be like the Germans , nothing but Herr Obermeister and Herr Untermeister . I can imagine it - " I am Mrs Colliery - Manager Crich - I am Mrs Member - of - Parliament Roddice . I am Miss Art - Teacher Brangwen . " Very pretty that . '
45939	45953	45955	45955	Gerald	264	' Things would work very much better , Miss Art - Teacher Brangwen , '
45957	45977	45874	45874	Gudrun	352	' What things , Mr Colliery - Manager Crich ? The relation between you and me , PAR EXEMPLE ? '
45978	45984	45986	45987	the Italian	1275	' Yes , for example , '
45989	45999	45986	45987	the Italian	1275	' That which is between men and women - ! '
46000	46007	46009	46009	Birkin	179	' That is non - social , '
46013	46016	46018	46018	Gerald	264	' Exactly , '
46020	46040	46018	46018	Gerald	264	' Between me and a woman , the social question does not enter . It is my own affair . '
46041	46050	46052	46052	Birkin	179	' A ten - pound note on it , '
46054	46067	46069	46071	Ursula of Gerald	264	' You do n't admit that a woman is a social being ? '
46073	46078	46080	46080	Gerald	264	' She is both , '
46082	46119	46080	46080	Gerald	264	' She is a social being , as far as society is concerned . But for her own private self , she is a free agent , it is her own affair , what she does . '
46120	46134	46136	46136	Ursula	264	' But wo n't it be rather difficult to arrange the two halves ? '
46138	46142	46144	46144	Gerald	264	' Oh no , '
46146	46159	46144	46144	Gerald	264	' They arrange themselves naturally - we see it now , everywhere . '
46160	46169	46179	46179	Gerald	264	' Do n't you laugh so pleasantly till you 're
46175	46178	46179	46179	Gerald	264	' said Birkin .
46187	46192	46193	46193	he	264	' Was I laughing ? '
46196	46199	46201	46201	Hermione	177	' IF , '
46205	46258	46201	46201	Hermione	177	' we could only realise , that in the SPIRIT we are all one , all equal in the spirit , all brothers there - the rest would n't matter , there would be no more of this carping and envy and this struggle for power , which destroys , only destroys . '
46292	46357	46283	46283	Birkin	179	' It is just the opposite , just the contrary , Hermione . We are all different and unequal in spirit - it is only the SOCIAL differences that are based on accidental material conditions . We are all abstractly or mathematically equal , if you like . Every man has hunger and thirst , two eyes , one nose and two legs . We 're
46461	46640	46641	46641	Hermione	177	' But I , myself , who am myself , what have I to do with equality with any other man or woman ? In the spirit , I am as separate as one star is from another , as different in quality and quantity . Establish a state on THAT . One man is n't any better than another , not because they are equal , but because they are intrinsically OTHER , that there is no term of comparison . The minute you begin to compare , one man is seen to be far better than another , all the inequality you can imagine is there by nature . I want every man to have his share in the world 's goods , so that I am rid of his importunity , so that I can tell him : " Now you 've got what you want - you 've got your fair share of the world 's gear . Now , you one - mouthed fool , mind yourself and do n't obstruct me . " '
46712	46720	46722	46722	Gerald	264	' It SOUNDS like megalomania , Rupert , '
46738	46744	46745	46745	he	1456	' Yes , let it , '
47620	47628	47629	47629	he	1456	' No you do n't , Hermione , '
47636	47643	47629	47629	he	1456	' I do n't let you . '
47662	47670	47671	47671	he	1456	' Stand away and let me go , '

49662	49666	49668	49668	Ursula	264	' The fool ! '
49671	49684	49668	49668	Ursula	264	' Why does n't he ride away till it 's gone by ? '
49971	49993	49995	49995	Ursula	264	' No - ! No - ! Let her go ! Let her go , you fool , you FOOL - ! '

50769	50822	50760	50760	Ursula	264	' Why could n't he take the horse away , till the trucks had gone by ? He 's a fool , and a bully . Does he think it 's manly , to torture a horse ? It 's a living thing , why should he bully it and torture it ? '
50840	50880	50834	50834	his	1565	' Yes , it 's as nice a little mare as you could set eyes on - beautiful little thing , beautiful . Now you could n't see his father treat any animal like that - not you . They 're

50909	50917	50919	50919	Ursula	264	' But why does he do it ? '
50921	50948	50919	50919	Ursula	264	' why does he ? Does he think he 's grand , when he 's bullied a sensitive creature , ten times as sensitive as himself ? '
50977	50992	50993	50993	he	5376	' I expect he 's got to train the mare to stand to anything , '
50996	51031	50993	50993	he	5376	' A pure - bred Harab - not the sort of breed as is used to round here - different sort from our sort altogether . They say as he got her from Constantinople . '
51032	51036	51038	51038	Ursula	264	' He would ! '
51040	51052	50993	50993	he	5376	' He 'd better have left her to the Turks , I 'm

51606	51636	51638	51640	the young man	687	' Her with the red stockings . What d'you say ? I 'd give my week 's wages for five minutes ; what ! - just for five minutes . '

51655	51658	51638	51640	the young man	687	' he replied .

51822	51833	51818	51820	the old man	1619	' By God , if it is n't to me ! '
51921	51933	51935	51935	Gudrun	352	' It has a foul kind of beauty , this place , '
51942	51968	51935	51935	Gudrun	352	' Ca n't you feel in some way , a thick , hot attraction in it ? I can . And it quite stupifies me . '
51976	52119	51969	51969	They	935	' dwellings . In the back yards of several dwellings , a miner could be seen washing himself in the open on this hot evening , naked down to the loins , his great trousers of moleskin slipping almost away . Miners already cleaned were sitting on their heels , with their backs near the walls , talking and silent in pure physical well - being , tired , and taking physical rest . Their voices sounded out with strong intonation , and the broad dialect was curiously caressing to the blood . It seemed to envelop Gudrun in a labourer 's caress , there was in the whole atmosphere a resonance of physical men , a glamorous thickness of labour and maleness , surcharged in the air . But it was universal in the district , and therefore unnoticed by the inhabitants .

54151	54159	54161	54161	Hermione	177	' How do you do , Gudrun ? '
54172	54178	54161	54161	Hermione	177	' What are you doing ? '
54179	54191	54228	54228	Hermione	177	' How do you do , Hermione ? I WAS sketching . '
54192	54196	54161	54161	Hermione	177	' Were you ? '
54210	54222	54228	54228	Hermione	177	' May we see ? I should like to SO much . '
54233	54236	54238	54238	Gudrun	352	' Well - '
54252	54261	54242	54242	she	352	' there 's nothing in the least interesting . '

54477	54479	54481	54481	you	264	' THAT 'S
54485	54519	54481	54481	you	264	' said Hermione , looking searchingly at the plants on the shore , and comparing with Gudrun 's drawing . Gudrun looked round in the direction of Hermione 's long , pointing finger . '
54528	54534	54481	54481	you	264	' repeated Hermione , needing confirmation .
54535	54538	54540	54540	Gudrun	352	' Yes , '
54548	54553	54555	54555	Gerald	264	' Let me look , '

54913	54921	54948	54948	Gudrun	352	' Ca n't we save the drawings ? '
54941	54946	54948	54948	Gudrun	352	' I assure you , '
54954	54977	54948	54948	Gudrun	352	' the drawings are quite as good as ever they were , for my purpose . I want them only for reference . '
54978	55012	54930	54930	Gudrun	352	' But ca n't I give you a new book ? I wish you 'd let me do that . I feel so truly sorry . I feel it was all my fault . '
55013	55020	55022	55022	Gudrun	352	' As far as I saw , '
55024	55065	55022	55022	Gudrun	352	' it was n't your fault at all . If there was any FAULT , it was Mr Crich 's . But the whole thing is ENTIRELY trivial , and it really is ridiculous to take any notice of it . '

55498	55534	55535	55535	She	177	' singing . On the bright hill - sides was a subdued smoulder of gorse . A few forget - me - nots flowered by the water . There was a rousedness and a glancing everywhere .
55741	55748	55731	55731	he	1771	' How do you do ? I 'm
55765	55765	55731	55731	he	1771	'

55824	55843	55815	55815	she	177	' But I do n't know anything about carpentry . It LOOKS right , do n't you think ? '
55844	55894	55770	55770	him	1771	' Yes , I think . I hope it wo n't let me to the bottom , that 's all . Though even so , it is n't a great matter , I should come up again . Help me to get it into the water , will you ? '
55909	55912	55913	55913	he	1771	' Now , '
55916	55942	55913	55913	he	1771	' I 'll try it and you can watch what happens . Then if it carries , I 'll take you over to the island . '

56023	56027	56028	56028	he	1771	' Rather overgrown , '
56036	56054	56028	56028	he	1771	' but very nice . I 'll come and fetch you . The boat leaks a little . '
56072	56080	56081	56081	he	1771	' It 'll float us all right , '
56123	56130	56131	56131	he	1771	' I shall mow this down , '
56134	56147	56131	56131	he	1771	' and then it will be romantic - like Paul et Virginie . '
56148	56159	56161	56161	Ursula	264	' Yes , one could have lovely Watteau picnics here , '
56169	56178	56179	56179	he	1771	' I do n't want Watteau picnics here , '
56182	56187	56188	56188	she	177	' Only your Virginie , '
56191	56195	56196	56196	he	1771	' Virginie enough , '
56200	56210	56196	56196	he	1771	' No , I do n't want her either . '
56240	56250	56251	56251	she	177	' You have been ill ; have n't you ? '
56257	56260	56261	56261	he	1771	' Yes , '
56288	56295	56296	56296	she	177	' Has it made you frightened ? '
56299	56303	56304	56304	he	1771	' What of ? '
56335	56348	56349	56349	she	177	' It IS frightening to be very ill , is n't it ? '
56352	56358	56359	56359	he	1771	' It is n't pleasant , '
56362	56393	56359	56359	he	1771	' Whether one is really afraid of death , or not , I have never decided . In one mood , not a bit , in another , very much . '
56394	56427	56349	56349	she	177	' But does n't it make you feel ashamed ? I think it makes one so ashamed , to be ill - illness is so terribly humiliating , do n't you think ? '
56434	56439	56440	56440	he	1771	' May - be , '
56443	56509	56440	56440	he	1771	' Though one knows all the time one 's life is n't really right , at the source . That 's the humiliation . I do n't see that the illness counts so much , after that . One is ill because one does n't live properly - ca n't . It 's the failure to live that makes one ill , and humiliates one . '
56510	56518	56519	56519	she	177	' But do you fail to live ? '
56525	56556	56440	56440	he	1771	' Why yes - I do n't make much of a success of my days . One seems always to be bumping one 's nose against the blank wall ahead . '
56578	56583	56584	56584	she	177	' Your poor nose ! '
56595	56602	56603	56603	he	1771	' No wonder it 's ugly , '
56632	56644	56645	56645	she	177	' But I'M happy - I think life is AWFULLY jolly , '
56648	56651	56652	56652	he	1771	' Good , '
56720	56730	56731	56731	she	177	' I DO enjoy things - do n't you ? '
56734	56787	56689	56689	He	1771	' Oh yes ! But it infuriates me that I ca n't get right , at the really growing part of me . I feel all tangled and messed up , and I CAN'T get straight anyhow . I do n't know what really to DO . One must do something somewhere . '
56788	56796	56797	56797	she	177	' Why should you always be DOING ? '
56800	56831	56797	56797	she	177	' It is so plebeian . I think it is much better to be really patrician , and to do nothing but just be oneself , like a walking flower . '
56832	56837	56838	56838	he	1771	' I quite agree , '
56841	56898	56838	56838	he	1771	' if one has burst into blossom . But I ca n't get my flower to blossom anyhow . Either it is blighted in the bud , or has got the smother - fly , or it is n't nourished . Curse it , it is n't even a bud . It is a contravened knot . '
56962	56968	56969	56969	she	177	' And why is it , '
56974	56988	56969	56969	she	177	' that there is no flowering , no dignity of human life now ? '
56989	57072	56946	56946	She	177	' The whole idea is dead . Humanity itself is dry - rotten , really . There are myriads of human beings hanging on the bush - and they look very nice and rosy , your healthy young men and women . But they are apples of Sodom , as a matter of fact , Dead Sea Fruit , gall - apples . It is n't true that they have any significance - their insides are full of bitter , corrupt ash . '
57073	57080	57082	57082	Ursula	264	' But there ARE good people , '
57084	57108	56946	56946	She	177	' Good enough for the life of today . But mankind is a dead tree , covered with fine brilliant galls of people . '
57135	57146	57147	57147	she	177	' And if it is so , WHY is it ? '
57164	57186	57223	57223	His	1771	' Why , why are people all balls of bitter dust ? Because they wo n't fall off the tree when they 're
57216	57216	57223	57223	His	1771	'
57249	57262	57263	57263	she	177	' But even if everybody is wrong - where are you right ? '
57266	57273	57263	57263	she	177	' where are you any better ? '
57274	57279	57291	57291	my	0	' I ? - I 'm
57283	57288	57291	57291	my	0	' he cried back . '
57456	57456	57792	57792	his	1798	'
57457	57460	57462	57462	Ursula	264	' But , '
57465	57497	57462	57462	Ursula	264	' that does n't alter the fact that love is the greatest , does it ? What they DO does n't alter the truth of what they say , does it ? '
57498	57723	57792	57792	his	1798	' Completely , because if what they say WERE true , then they could n't help fulfilling it . But they maintain a lie , and so they run amok at last . It 's a lie to say that love is the greatest . You might as well say that hate is the greatest , since the opposite of everything balances . What people want is hate - hate and nothing but hate . And in the name of righteousness and love , they get it . They distil themselves with nitroglycerine , all the lot of them , out of very love . It 's the lie that kills . If we want hate , let us have it - death , murder , torture , violent destruction - let us have it : but not in the name of love . But I abhor humanity , I wish it was swept away . It could go , and there would be no ABSOLUTE loss , if every human being perished tomorrow . The reality would be untouched . Nay , it would be better . The real tree of life would then be rid of the most ghastly , heavy crop of Dead Sea Fruit , the intolerable burden of myriad simulacra of people , an infinite weight of mortal lies . '
57724	57735	57737	57737	Ursula	264	' So you 'd like everybody in the world destroyed ? '
57739	57744	57792	57792	his	1798	' I should indeed . '
57745	57753	57792	57792	his	1798	' And the world empty of people ? '
57754	57787	57792	57792	his	1798	' Yes truly . You yourself , do n't you find it a beautiful clean thought , a world empty of people , just uninterrupted grass , and a hare sitting up ? '
57839	57842	57843	57843	she	1799	' But , '
57846	57861	57843	57843	she	1799	' you 'd be dead yourself , so what good would it do you ? '
57862	57908	57792	57792	his	1798	' I would die like a shot , to know that the earth would really be cleaned of all the people . It is the most beautiful and freeing thought . Then there would NEVER be another foul humanity created , for a universal defilement . '
57909	57912	57914	57914	Ursula	264	' No , '
57916	57922	57914	57914	Ursula	264	' there would be nothing . '
57923	57944	57792	57792	his	1798	' What ! Nothing ? Just because humanity was wiped out ? You flatter yourself . There 'd be everything . '
57945	57955	57914	57914	Ursula	264	' But how , if there were no people ? '
57956	58050	57792	57792	his	1798	' Do you think that creation depends on MAN ! It merely does n't . There are the trees and the grass and birds . I much prefer to think of the lark rising up in the morning upon a human - less world . Man is a mistake , he must go . There is the grass , and hares and adders , and the unseen hosts , actual angels that go about freely when a dirty humanity does n't interrupt them - and good pure - tissued demons : very nice . '
58128	58197	58117	58117	Her	1801	' If only man was swept off the face of the earth , creation would go on so marvellously , with a new start , non - human . Man is one of the mistakes of creation - like the ichthyosauri . If only he were gone again , think what lovely things would come out of the liberated days ; - things straight out of the fire . '
58198	58206	58207	58207	she	1801	' But man will never be gone , '
58221	58229	58207	58207	she	1801	' The world will go with him . '
58230	58234	58235	58235	he	1800	' Ah no , '
58238	58341	58235	58235	he	1800	' not so . I believe in the proud angels and the demons that are our fore - runners . They will destroy us , because we are not proud enough . The ichthyosauri were not proud : they crawled and floundered as we do . And besides , look at elder - flowers and bluebells - they are a sign that pure creation takes place - even the butterfly . But humanity never gets beyond the caterpillar stage - it rots in the chrysalis , it never will have wings . It is anti - creation , like monkeys and baboons . '
58518	58521	58522	58522	she	1802	' But , '
58525	58543	58522	58522	she	1802	' you believe in individual love , even if you do n't believe in loving humanity - ? '
58544	58671	58497	58497	anybody	748	' I do n't believe in love at all - that is , any more than I believe in hate , or in grief . Love is one of the emotions like all the others - and so it is all right whilst you feel it But I ca n't see how it becomes an absolute . It is just part of human relationships , no more . And it is only part of ANY human relationship . And why one should be required ALWAYS to feel it , any more than one always feels sorrow or distant joy , I can not conceive . Love is n't a desideratum - it is an emotion you feel or you do n't feel , according to circumstance . '
58672	58683	58684	58684	she	1802	' Then why do you care about people at all ? '
58687	58703	58684	58684	she	1802	' if you do n't believe in love ? Why do you bother about humanity ? '
58704	58718	58781	58781	she	1802	' Why do I ? Because I ca n't get away from it . '
58719	58725	58726	58726	she	1802	' Because you love it , '
58733	58740	58741	58741	he	1807	' If I do love it , '
58744	58750	58741	58741	he	1807	' it is my disease . '
58751	58766	58767	58767	she	1802	' But it is a disease you do n't want to be cured of , '
58787	58803	58804	58804	she	1802	' And if you do n't believe in love , what DO you believe in ? '
58808	58820	58804	58804	she	1802	' Simply in the end of the world , and grass ? '
58829	58837	58838	58838	he	1807	' I believe in the unseen hosts , '
58841	58864	58895	58895	Ursula	264	' And nothing else ? You believe in nothing visible , except grass and birds ? Your world is a poor show . '
58865	58870	58871	58871	he	1807	' Perhaps it is , '
59134	59140	59141	59141	he	1807	' The point about love , '
59150	59186	59141	59141	he	1807	' is that we hate the word because we have vulgarised it . It ought to be prescribed , tabooed from utterance , for many years , till we get a new , better idea . '
59196	59205	59206	59206	she	1802	' But it always means the same thing , '
59209	59223	59224	59224	he	1807	' Ah God , no , let it not mean that any more , '
59227	59234	59224	59224	he	1807	' Let the old meanings go . '
59235	59242	59243	59243	she	1802	' But still it is love , '
59266	59269	59270	59270	he	1807	' No , '
59273	59296	59270	59270	he	1807	' it is n't . Spoken like that , never in the world . You 've no business to utter the word . '
59297	59320	59321	59321	she	1802	' I must leave it to you , to take it out of the Ark of the Covenant at the right moment , '
59537	59550	59551	59551	she	1802	' Do let us go to the shore , to follow them , '
59626	59629	59630	59630	he	1802	' Look , '
59633	59651	59630	59630	he	1802	' your boat of purple paper is escorting them , and they are a convoy of rafts . '
59695	59702	59703	59703	she	1802	' Why are they so lovely , '
59706	59715	59703	59703	she	1802	' Why do I think them so lovely ? '
59716	59722	59723	59723	he	1802	' They are nice flowers , '
59735	59771	59703	59703	she	1802	' You know that a daisy is a company of florets , a concourse , become individual . Do n't the botanists put it highest in the line of development ? I believe they do . '
59772	59782	59784	59784	Ursula	264	' The compositae , yes , I think so , '
59811	59818	59819	59819	he	1802	' Explain it so , then , '
59822	59843	59819	59819	he	1802	' The daisy is a perfect little democracy , so it 's the highest of flowers , hence its charm . '
59844	59847	59848	59848	she	1802	' No , '
59851	59861	59848	59848	she	1802	' no - never . It is n't democratic . '
59862	59865	59866	59866	he	1802	' No , '
59869	59890	59866	59866	he	1802	' It 's the golden mob of the proletariat , surrounded by a showy white fence of the idle rich . '
59891	59900	59901	59901	she	1802	' How hateful - your hateful social orders ! '
59904	59918	59866	59866	he	1802	' Quite ! It 's a daisy - we 'll leave it alone . '
59919	59931	59932	59932	she	1802	' Do . Let it be a dark horse for once , '
59935	59946	59947	59947	she	1802	' if anything can be a dark horse to you , '
60018	60022	60023	60023	he	1802	' You know , '
60026	60048	60023	60023	he	1802	' that I am having rooms here at the mill ? Do n't you think we can have some good times ? '
60049	60054	60055	60055	she	1802	' Oh are you ? '
60076	60087	60088	60088	he	1802	' If I find I can live sufficiently by myself , '
60091	60179	60088	60088	he	1802	' I shall give up my work altogether . It has become dead to me . I do n't believe in the humanity I pretend to be part of , I do n't care a straw for the social ideals I live by , I hate the dying organic form of social mankind - so it ca n't be anything but trumpery , to work at education . I shall drop it as soon as I am clear enough - tomorrow perhaps - and be by myself . '

60192	60210	60088	60088	he	1802	' Yes - I 've about four hundred a year . That makes it easy for me . '
60216	60222	60224	60224	Ursula	264	' And what about Hermione ? '
60226	60245	60088	60088	he	1802	' That 's over , finally - a pure failure , and never could have been anything else . '
60246	60254	60088	60088	he	1802	' But you still know each other ? '

60434	60458	60425	60425	he	1832	' I believe that is Hermione come now , with Gerald Crich . She wanted to see the rooms before they are furnished . '

60467	60476	60465	60465	Ursula	264	' She will superintend the furnishing for you . '
60477	60484	60425	60425	he	1832	' Probably . Does it matter ? '
60485	60494	60496	60496	Ursula	264	' Oh no , I should think not , '
60498	60527	60496	60496	Ursula	264	' Though personally , I ca n't bear her . I think she is a lie , if you like , you who are always talking about lies . '
60540	60568	60529	60529	she	1832	' Yes , and I do mind if she furnishes your rooms - I do mind . I mind that you keep her hanging on at all . '
60576	60579	60580	60580	he	1833	' Perhaps , '
60583	60640	60580	60580	he	1833	' I do n't WANT her to furnish the rooms here - and I do n't keep her hanging on . Only , I need n't be churlish to her , need I ? At any rate , I shall have to go down and see them now . You 'll come , wo n't you ? '
60641	60648	60649	60649	she	1834	' I do n't think so , '
60655	60674	60580	60580	he	1833	' Wo n't you ? Yes do . Come and see the rooms as well . Do come . '

61242	61251	61252	61252	she	177	' Yes , does n't he look comical ? '
61255	61261	61252	61252	she	177	' Like a stupid husband . '

61794	61806	61791	61791	she	177	' It will do very nicely . Thank you so much . '

61846	61851	61853	61853	Hermione	177	' Do you mind ? '
61862	61868	61869	61869	they	1850	' Not in the least , '
61872	61880	61881	61881	she	177	' Which room shall we do first ? '
61904	61913	61914	61914	he	264	' We 'll take them as they come , '
61917	61931	61933	61936	the labourer 's wife	1839	' Should I be getting your teas ready , while you do that ? '
61947	61951	61953	61953	Hermione	177	' Would you ? '
61987	62000	61972	61972	her	882	' I should be so glad . Where shall we have it ? '

62037	62063	62065	62065	Birkin	179	' On the bank by the pond . And WE'LL carry the things up , if you 'll just get them ready , Mrs Salmon , '
62067	62071	62073	62075	the pleased woman	1856	' All right , '
62109	62116	62118	62118	Hermione	177	' This is the dining room , '
62120	62135	62118	62118	Hermione	177	' We 'll measure it this way , Rupert - you go down there - '
62136	62145	62147	62147	Gerald	264	' Ca n't I do it for you , '
62158	62164	62166	62166	Hermione	177	' No , thank you , '
62321	62327	62329	62329	Hermione	177	' This is the study , '
62331	62365	62329	62329	Hermione	177	' Rupert , I have a rug that I want you to have for here . Will you let me give it to you ? Do - I want to give it you . '
62366	62372	62373	62373	he	1868	' What is it like ? '
62377	62420	62329	62329	Hermione	177	' You have n't seen it . It is chiefly rose red , then blue , a metallic , mid - blue , and a very soft dark blue . I think you would like it . Do you think you would ? '
62421	62427	62428	62428	he	1868	' It sounds very nice , '
62431	62442	62428	62428	he	1868	' What is it ? Oriental ? With a pile ? '
62443	62478	62329	62329	Hermione	177	' Yes . Persian ! It is made of camel 's hair , silky . I think it is called Bergamos - twelve feet by seven - . Do you think it will do ? '
62479	62484	62485	62485	he	1868	' It would DO , '
62488	62510	62485	62485	he	1868	' But why should you give me an expensive rug ? I can manage perfectly well with my old Oxford Turkish . '
62511	62524	62329	62329	Hermione	177	' But may I give it to you ? Do let me . '
62525	62532	62485	62485	he	1868	' How much did it cost ? '
62541	62552	62533	62533	She	1869	' I do n't remember . It was quite cheap . '
62562	62573	62574	62574	he	1868	' I do n't want to take it , Hermione , '
62577	62587	62588	62588	she	1869	' Do let me give it to the rooms , '
62606	62613	62588	62588	she	1869	' I shall be so disappointed . '
62614	62627	62628	62628	he	1868	' You know I do n't want you to give me things , '
62632	62642	62643	62643	she	1869	' I do n't want to give you THINGS , '
62647	62654	62643	62643	she	1869	' But will you have this ? '
62655	62659	62660	62660	he	1868	' All right , '
62734	62743	62744	62744	she	1869	' Are you SURE you were quite comfortable ? '
62751	62754	62755	62755	he	1868	' Perfectly , '
62759	62788	62744	62744	she	1869	' And were you warm ? There is no down quilt . I am sure you need one . You must n't have a great pressure of clothes . '
62789	62795	62796	62796	he	1868	' I 've got one , '
62799	62805	62796	62796	he	1868	' It is coming down . '
62898	62913	62895	62895	Gerald	264	' Oh , I hated you so much the other day , Mr Crich , '
62914	62918	62920	62920	Gerald	264	' What for ? '
62926	62942	62895	62895	Gerald	264	' For treating your horse so badly . Oh , I hated you so much ! '
62943	62949	62951	62951	Hermione	177	' What did he do ? '
62953	63004	62895	62895	Gerald	264	' He made his lovely sensitive Arab horse stand with him at the railway - crossing whilst a horrible lot of trucks went by ; and the poor thing , she was in a perfect frenzy , a perfect agony . It was the most horrible sight you can imagine . '
63005	63014	63016	63016	Hermione	177	' Why did you do it , Gerald ? '
63022	63051	62895	62895	Gerald	264	' She must learn to stand - what use is she to me in this country , if she shies and goes off every time an engine whistles . '
63052	63059	63061	63061	Ursula	264	' But why inflict unnecessary torture ? '
63063	63109	63061	63061	Ursula	264	' Why make her stand all that time at the crossing ? You might just as well have ridden back up the road , and saved all that horror . Her sides were bleeding where you had spurred her . It was too horrible - ! '
63113	63120	63121	63121	he	264	' I have to use her , '
63124	63128	62895	62895	Gerald	264	' And if I 'm
63147	63147	62895	62895	Gerald	264	'
63148	63153	63155	63155	Ursula	264	' Why should she ? '
63160	63197	63155	63155	Ursula	264	' She is a living creature , why should she stand anything , just because you choose to make her ? She has as much right to her own being , as you have to yours . '
63198	63203	63205	63205	Gerald	264	' There I disagree , '
63207	63278	63205	63205	Gerald	264	' I consider that mare is there for my use . Not because I bought her , but because that is the natural order . It is more natural for a man to take a horse and use it as he likes , than for him to go down on his knees to it , begging it to do as it wishes , and to fulfil its own marvellous nature . '
63300	63375	63294	63294	her	177	' I do think - I do really think we must have the COURAGE to use the lower animal life for our needs . I do think there is something wrong , when we look on every living creature as if it were ourselves . I do feel , that it is false to project our own feelings on every animate creature . It is a lack of discrimination , a lack of criticism . '
63376	63379	63381	63381	Birkin	179	' Quite , '
63384	63401	63381	63381	Birkin	179	' Nothing is so detestable as the maudlin attributing of human feelings and consciousness to animals . '
63402	63405	63407	63407	Hermione	177	' Yes , '
63411	63434	63407	63407	Hermione	177	' we must really take a position . Either we are going to use the animals , or they will use us . '
63435	63441	63443	63443	Gerald	264	' That 's a fact , '
63445	63499	63443	63443	Gerald	264	' A horse has got a will like a man , though it has no MIND strictly . And if your will is n't master , then the horse is master of you . And this is a thing I ca n't help . I ca n't help being master of the horse . '
63500	63512	63514	63514	Hermione	177	' If only we could learn how to use our will , '
63516	63549	63514	63514	Hermione	177	' we could do anything . The will can cure anything , and put anything right . That I am convinced of - if only we use the will properly , intelligibly . '
63550	63561	63563	63563	Birkin	179	' What do you mean by using the will properly ? '
63565	63573	63574	63574	she	177	' A very great doctor taught me , '
63583	63626	63574	63574	she	177	' He told me for instance , that to cure oneself of a bad habit , one should FORCE oneself to do it , when one would not do it - make oneself do it - and then the habit would disappear . '
63627	63633	63635	63635	Gerald	264	' How do you mean ? '
63637	63676	63635	63635	Gerald	264	' If you bite your nails , for example . Then , when you do n't want to bite your nails , bite them , make yourself bite them . And you would find the habit was broken . '
63677	63682	63684	63684	Gerald	264	' Is that so ? '
63686	63729	63635	63635	Gerald	264	' Yes . And in so many things , I have MADE myself well . I was a very queer and nervous girl . And by learning to use my will , simply by using my will , I MADE myself right . '
63777	63788	63790	63790	Birkin	179	' It is fatal to use the will like that , '
63793	63803	63790	63790	Birkin	179	' disgusting . Such a will is an obscenity . '
63837	63839	63832	63832	her	177	' I 'm
63845	64005	63832	63832	her	177	' she said at length . There always seemed an interval , a strange split between what she seemed to feel and experience , and what she actually said and thought . She seemed to catch her thoughts at length from off the surface of a maelstrom of chaotic black emotions and reactions , and Birkin was always filled with repulsion , she caught so infallibly , her will never failed her . Her voice was always dispassionate and tense , and perfectly confident . Yet she shuddered with a sense of nausea , a sort of seasickness that always threatened to overwhelm her mind . But her mind remained unbroken , her will was still perfect . It almost sent Birkin mad . But he would never , never dare to break her will , and let loose the maelstrom of her subconsciousness , and see her in her ultimate madness . Yet he was always striking at her .
64006	64011	64012	64012	he	1886	' And of course , '
64017	64099	64012	64012	he	1886	' horses HAVEN'T got a complete will , like human beings . A horse has no ONE will . Every horse , strictly , has two wills . With one will , it wants to put itself in the human power completely - and with the other , it wants to be free , wild . The two wills sometimes lock - you know that , if ever you 've felt a horse bolt , while you 've been driving it . '
64100	64113	64115	64115	Gerald	264	' I have felt a horse bolt while I was driving it , '
64117	64137	64115	64115	Gerald	264	' but it did n't make me know it had two wills . I only knew it was frightened . '
64154	64168	64170	64170	Ursula	264	' Why should a horse want to put itself in the human power ? '
64172	64189	64170	64170	Ursula	264	' That is quite incomprehensible to me . I do n't believe it ever wanted it . '
64190	64215	64217	64217	Birkin	179	' Yes it did . It 's the last , perhaps highest , love - impulse : resign your will to the higher being , '
64219	64228	64230	64230	Ursula	264	' What curious notions you have of love , '
64232	64275	64170	64170	Ursula	264	' And woman is the same as horses : two wills act in opposition inside her . With one will , she wants to subject herself utterly . With the other she wants to bolt , and pitch her rider to perdition . '
64276	64279	64280	64281	a bolter	1888	' Then I 'm
64283	64292	64280	64281	a bolter	1888	' said Ursula , with a burst of laughter .
64293	64308	64310	64310	Birkin	179	' It 's a dangerous thing to domesticate even horses , let alone women , '
64312	64321	64310	64310	Birkin	179	' The dominant principle has some rare antagonists . '
64322	64327	64329	64329	Ursula	264	' Good thing too , '
64331	64334	64336	64336	Gerald	264	' Quite , '
64343	64349	64336	64336	Gerald	264	' There 's more fun . '
64367	64395	64356	64356	She	177	' Is n't the evening beautiful ! I get filled sometimes with such a great sense of beauty , that I feel I can hardly bear it . '
64450	64458	64460	64460	Ursula	264	' Would n't you like a dress , '
64464	64476	64460	64460	Ursula	264	' of this yellow spotted with orange - a cotton dress ? '
64477	64480	64482	64482	Hermione	177	' Yes , '
64502	64514	64482	64482	Hermione	177	' Would n't it be pretty ? I should LOVE it . '
64583	64646	64648	64648	Hermione	177	' I really do not want to be forced into all this criticism and analysis of life . I really DO want to see things in their entirety , with their beauty left to them , and their wholeness , their natural holiness .

64666	64669	64671	64671	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
64673	64687	64671	64671	Ursula	264	' I do . I am sick of all this poking and prying . '

64775	64787	64789	64789	Ursula	264	' And it would be simply wrong to live without them , '
64791	64827	64789	64789	Ursula	264	' No , it is so IRREVERENT to think that everything must be realised in the head . Really , something must be left to the Lord , there always is and always will be . '
64828	64831	64833	64833	Hermione	177	' Yes , '
64840	64851	64852	64852	she	0	' it should , should n't it ? And Rupert - '
64864	64911	64852	64852	she	0	' he CAN only tear things to pieces . He really IS like a boy who must pull everything to pieces to see how it is made . And I ca n't think it is right - it does seem so irreverent , as you say . '
64912	64927	64929	64929	Ursula	264	' Like tearing open a bud to see what the flower will be like , '
64931	64952	64852	64852	she	0	' Yes . And that kills everything , does n't it ? It does n't allow any possibility of flowering . '
64953	64958	64960	64960	Ursula	264	' Of course not , '
64962	64968	64960	64960	Ursula	264	' It is purely destructive . '
64969	64977	64852	64852	she	0	' It is , is n't it ! '
65076	65082	65084	65084	Hermione	177	' Shall we be going ? '
65086	65111	65084	65084	Hermione	177	' Rupert , you are coming to Shortlands to dinner ? Will you come at once , will you come now , with us ? '
65112	65114	65084	65084	Hermione	177	' I 'm

65144	65184	65142	65142	Gerald	264	' But if you 'd got as sick as I have of rowdy go - as - you - please in the house , you 'd prefer it if people were peaceful and conventional , at least at meals . '
65185	65189	65191	65191	Birkin	179	' All right , '
65193	65205	65207	65207	Hermione	177	' But ca n't we wait for you while you dress ? '
65209	65214	65215	65215	He	264	' If you like . '
65229	65232	65233	65233	she	1899	' Only , '
65240	65307	65233	65233	she	1899	' I must say that , however man is lord of the beast and the fowl , I still do n't think he has any right to violate the feelings of the inferior creation . I still think it would have been much more sensible and nice of you if you 'd trotted back up the road while the train went by , and been considerate . '
65308	65312	65314	65314	Gerald	264	' I see , '
65322	65329	65314	65314	Gerald	264	' I must remember another time . '
65330	65335	65233	65233	she	1899	' They all think I 'm
65340	65358	65336	65338	an interfering female	1900	' thought Ursula to herself , as she went away . But she was in arms against them .
65412	65418	65419	65419	she	1901	' She 's really good , '
65424	65432	65419	65419	she	1901	' She really wants what is right . '
65648	65657	65658	65658	she	1901	' Why does he ask Gudrun as well ? '
65664	65682	65658	65658	she	1901	' Does he want to protect himself , or does he think I would not go alone ? '
65709	65751	65703	65703	she	1901	' I do n't want Gudrun to be there , because I want him to say something more to me . So I sha n't tell Gudrun anything about it , and I shall go alone . Then I shall know . '
65977	65982	65983	65983	he	1919	' You are alone ? '
65986	65994	65983	65983	he	1919	' Yes - Gudrun could not come . '
66050	66057	66058	66058	she	1901	' How nice the fuchsias are ! '
66066	66081	66058	66058	she	1901	' Are n't they ! Did you think I had forgotten what I said ? '
66090	66107	66108	66108	she	1901	' I do n't want you to remember it - if you do n't want to , '
66128	66131	66132	66132	he	1919	' No , '
66135	66182	66132	66132	he	1919	' It is n't that . Only - if we are going to know each other , we must pledge ourselves for ever . If we are going to make a relationship , even of friendship , there must be something final and infallible about it . '
66232	66265	66222	66222	he	1919	' I ca n't say it is love I have to offer - and it is n't love I want . It is something much more impersonal and harder - and rarer . '
66277	66286	66274	66274	she	1901	' You mean you do n't love me ? '
66294	66351	66274	66274	she	1901	' Yes , if you like to put it like that . Though perhaps that is n't true . I do n't know . At any rate , I do n't feel the emotion of love for you - no , and I do n't want to . Because it gives out in the last issues . '
66352	66361	66362	66362	she	1901	' Love gives out in the last issues ? '
66371	66464	66274	66274	she	1901	' Yes , it does . At the very last , one is alone , beyond the influence of love . There is a real impersonal me , that is beyond love , beyond any emotional relationship . So it is with you . But we want to delude ourselves that love is the root . It is n't . It is only the branches . The root is beyond love , a naked kind of isolation , an isolated me , that does NOT meet and mingle , and never can . '
66483	66492	66493	66493	she	1901	' And you mean you ca n't love ? '
66499	66522	66465	66465	She	1901	' Yes , if you like . I have loved . But there is a beyond , where there is not love . '
66543	66557	66558	66558	she	1901	' But how do you know - if you have never REALLY loved ? '
66561	66604	66648	66648	she	1901	' It is true , what I say ; there is a beyond , in you , in me , which is further than love , beyond the scope , as stars are beyond the scope of vision , some of them . '
66605	66612	66614	66614	Ursula	264	' Then there is no love , '
66616	66635	66648	66648	she	1901	' Ultimately , no , there is something else . But , ultimately , there IS no love . '
66664	66677	66648	66648	she	1901	' Then let me go home - what am I doing here ? '
66678	66684	66685	66685	he	264	' There is the door , '
66688	66695	66685	66685	he	264	' You are a free agent . '
66719	66730	66731	66731	she	1901	' If there is no love , what is there ? '
66737	66740	66741	66741	he	264	' Something , '
66758	66761	66741	66741	he	264	' What ? '
66786	66790	66791	66791	he	264	' There is , '
66801	66978	66791	66791	he	264	' a final me which is stark and impersonal and beyond responsibility . So there is a final you . And it is there I would want to meet you - not in the emotional , loving plane - but there beyond , where there is no speech and no terms of agreement . There we are two stark , unknown beings , two utterly strange creatures , I would want to approach you , and you me . And there could be no obligation , because there is no standard for action there , because no understanding has been reaped from that plane . It is quite inhuman , - so there can be no calling to book , in any form whatsoever - because one is outside the pale of all that is accepted , and nothing known applies . One can only follow the impulse , taking that which lies in front , and responsible for nothing , asked for nothing , giving nothing , only each taking according to the primal desire . '
67002	67009	67010	67010	she	1901	' It is just purely selfish , '
67013	67106	66993	66993	he	264	' If it is pure , yes . But it is n't selfish at all . Because I do n't KNOW what I want of you . I deliver MYSELF over to the unknown , in coming to you , I am without reserves or defences , stripped entirely , into the unknown . Only there needs the pledge between us , that we will both cast off everything , cast off ourselves even , and cease to be , so that that which is perfectly ourselves can take place in us . '
67116	67130	67131	67131	she	1901	' But it is because you love me , that you want me ? '
67134	67155	66993	66993	he	264	' No it is n't . It is because I believe in you - if I DO believe in you . '
67156	67162	67163	67163	she	1901	' Are n't you sure ? '
67182	67201	67202	67202	he	1924	' Yes , I must believe in you , or else I should n't be here saying this , '
67205	67228	67202	67202	he	1924	' But that is all the proof I have . I do n't feel any very strong belief at this particular moment . '
67241	67252	67253	67253	she	1901	' But do n't you think me good - looking ? '
67278	67285	67253	67253	she	1901	' I do n't FEEL that you 're
67290	67293	67253	67253	she	1901	' he said .
67294	67299	67300	67300	she	1901	' Not even attractive ? '
67313	67331	67332	67332	he	1924	' Do n't you see that it 's not a question of visual appreciation in the least , '
67335	67352	67332	67332	he	1924	' I do n't WANT to see you . I 've seen plenty of women , I 'm
67369	67369	67364	67364	I	0	'
67370	67372	67332	67332	he	1924	' I 'm
67383	67386	67374	67374	I	0	' she laughed .
67387	67390	67391	67391	he	1924	' Yes , '
67394	67426	67391	67391	he	1924	' you are invisible to me , if you do n't force me to be visually aware of you . But I do n't want to see you or hear you . '
67427	67439	67440	67440	she	0	' What did you ask me to tea for , then ? '
67458	67521	67452	67452	He	1924	' I want to find you , where you do n't know your own existence , the you that your common self denies utterly . But I do n't want your good looks , and I do n't want your womanly feelings , and I do n't want your thoughts nor opinions nor your ideas - they are all bagatelles to me . '
67522	67530	67531	67531	she	0	' You are very conceited , Monsieur , '
67534	67564	67531	67531	she	0	' How do you know what my womanly feelings are , or my thoughts or my ideas ? You do n't even know what I think of you now . '
67565	67574	67452	67452	He	1924	' Nor do I care in the slightest . '
67575	67605	67531	67531	she	0	' I think you are very silly . I think you want to tell me you love me , and you go all this way round to do it . '
67606	67610	67611	67611	he	1927	' All right , '
67620	67642	67611	67611	he	1927	' Now go away then , and leave me alone . I do n't want any more of your meretricious persiflage . '
67643	67649	67650	67650	she	1928	' Is it really persiflage ? '
67717	67728	67729	67729	he	1927	' What I want is a strange conjunction with you - '
67733	67763	67729	67729	he	1927	' not meeting and mingling - you are quite right - but an equilibrium , a pure balance of two single beings - as the stars balance each other . '
67808	67815	67816	67816	she	1928	' Is n't this rather sudden ? '
67824	67838	67839	67839	he	1927	' Best to read the terms of the contract , before we sign , '
67909	67915	67917	67917	Birkin	179	' What 's he after ? '
68199	68206	68208	68208	Birkin	179	' She is a wild cat , '
68210	68219	68208	68208	Birkin	179	' She has come in from the woods . '
68383	68391	68393	68393	Ursula	264	' Now why does he do that ? '
68397	68404	68406	68406	Birkin	179	' They are on intimate terms , '
68408	68417	68457	68457	she	1928	' And is that why he hits her ? '
68418	68421	68423	68423	Birkin	179	' Yes , '
68425	68438	68423	68423	Birkin	179	' I think he wants to make it quite obvious to her . '
68439	68447	68448	68448	she	1928	' Is n't it horrid of him ! '
68463	68475	68457	68457	she	1928	' Stop it , do n't bully . Stop hitting her . '
68502	68510	68511	68511	Birkin	179	' Are you a bully , Mino ? '
68550	68553	68555	68555	Ursula	264	' Mino , '
68557	68572	68555	68555	Ursula	264	' I do n't like you . You are a bully like all males . '
68573	68576	68578	68578	Birkin	179	' No , '
68580	68638	68578	68578	Birkin	179	' he is justified . He is not a bully . He is only insisting to the poor stray that she shall acknowledge him as a sort of fate , her own fate : because you can see she is fluffy and promiscuous as the wind . I am with him entirely . He wants superfine stability . '
68639	68645	68647	68647	Ursula	264	' Yes , I know ! '
68649	68674	68647	68647	Ursula	264	' He wants his own way - I know what your fine words work down to - bossiness , I call it , bossiness . '
68689	68698	68700	68700	Birkin	179	' I quite agree with you , Miciotto , '
68705	68716	68700	68700	Birkin	179	' Keep your male dignity , and your higher understanding . '
68767	68786	68788	68788	Birkin	179	' Now he will find the belle sauvage once more , and entertain her with his superior wisdom , '
68814	68847	68811	68811	she	1955	' Oh it makes me so cross , this assumption of male superiority ! And it is such a lie ! One would n't mind if there were any justification for it . '
68848	68853	68855	68855	Birkin	179	' The wild cat , '
68857	68869	68855	68855	Birkin	179	' does n't mind . She perceives that it is justified . '
68870	68874	68876	68876	Ursula	264	' Does she ! '
68878	68887	68876	68876	Ursula	264	' And tell it to the Horse Marines . '
68888	68893	68855	68855	Birkin	179	' To them also . '
68894	68922	68876	68876	Ursula	264	' It is just like Gerald Crich with his horse - a lust for bullying - a real Wille zur Macht - so base , so petty . '
68923	69011	68855	68855	Birkin	179	' I agree that the Wille zur Macht is a base and petty thing . But with the Mino , it is the desire to bring this female cat into a pure stable equilibrium , a transcendent and abiding RAPPORT with the single male . Whereas without him , as you see , she is a mere stray , a fluffy sporadic bit of chaos . It is a volonte de pouvoir , if you like , a will to ability , taking pouvoir as a verb . '
69012	69024	68876	68876	Ursula	264	' Ah - ! Sophistries ! It 's the old Adam . '
69025	69052	68855	68855	Birkin	179	' Oh yes . Adam kept Eve in the indestructible paradise , when he kept her single with himself , like a star in its orbit . '
69053	69058	69060	69060	Ursula	264	' Yes - yes - '
69068	69130	69063	69063	her	1956	' There you are - a star in its orbit ! A satellite - a satellite of Mars - that 's what she is to be ! There - there - you 've given yourself away ! You want a satellite , Mars and his satellite ! You 've said it - you 've said it - you 've dished yourself ! '
69171	69180	69181	69181	he	1957	' I 've not said it at all , '
69184	69195	69181	69181	he	1957	' if you will give me a chance to speak . '
69196	69201	69202	69202	she	1956	' No , no ! '
69205	69222	69202	69202	she	1956	' I wo n't let you speak . You 've said it , a satellite , you 're
69236	69236	69231	69231	You	1957	'
69237	69249	69250	69250	he	1957	' You 'll never believe now that I HAVEN'T said it , '
69253	69271	69250	69250	he	1957	' I neither implied nor indicated nor mentioned a satellite , nor intended a satellite , never . '
69272	69276	69277	69277	she	1956	' YOU PREVARICATOR ! '
69284	69291	69293	69297	the landlady from the doorway	1958	' Tea is ready , sir , '
69320	69327	69299	69299	They	1959	' Thank you , Mrs Daykin . '
69343	69349	69350	69350	he	1957	' Come and have tea , '
69353	69361	69362	69362	she	1956	' Yes , I should love it , '
69379	69401	69369	69369	They	1714	' I did not say , nor imply , a satellite . I meant two single equal stars balanced in conjunction - '
69402	69416	69417	69417	she	1956	' You gave yourself away , you gave away your little game completely , '
69447	69454	69455	69455	she	1956	' What GOOD things to eat ! '
69458	69464	69465	69465	he	1957	' Take your own sugar , '
69532	69539	69540	69540	she	1956	' Your things are so lovely ! '
69546	69584	69528	69528	Hermione	177	' I like them . It gives me real pleasure to use things that are attractive in themselves - pleasant things . And Mrs Daykin is good . She thinks everything is wonderful , for my sake . '
69585	69588	69590	69590	Ursula	264	' Really , '
69592	69625	69590	69590	Ursula	264	' landladies are better than wives , nowadays . They certainly CARE a great deal more . It is much more beautiful and complete here now , than if you were married . '
69626	69634	69635	69635	he	1957	' But think of the emptiness within , '
69638	69641	69642	69642	she	1956	' No , '
69645	69668	69642	69642	she	1956	' I am jealous that men have such perfect landladies and such beautiful lodgings . There is nothing left them to desire . '
69669	69692	69590	69590	Ursula	264	' In the house - keeping way , we 'll hope not . It is disgusting , people marrying for a home . '
69693	69696	69698	69698	Ursula	264	' Still , '
69700	69715	69698	69698	Ursula	264	' a man has very little need for a woman now , has he ? '
69716	69756	69590	69590	Ursula	264	' In outer things , maybe - except to share his bed and bear his children . But essentially , there is just the same need as there ever was . Only nobody takes the trouble to be essential . '
69757	69761	69762	69762	she	1956	' How essential ? '
69765	69770	69771	69771	he	1957	' I do think , '
69774	69806	69771	69771	he	1957	' that the world is only held together by the mystic conjunction , the ultimate unison between people - a bond . And the immediate bond is between man and woman . '
69807	69815	69817	69817	Ursula	264	' But it 's such old hat , '
69819	69830	69771	69771	he	1957	' Why should love be a bond ? No , I 'm

69847	69872	69844	69844	he	1957	' you forfeit the northern and eastward and southern direction . If you admit a unison , you forfeit all the possibilities of chaos . '
69873	69879	69880	69880	she	1956	' But love is freedom , '
69883	69891	69892	69892	he	1957	' Do n't ca nt to me , '
69895	69916	69892	69892	he	1957	' Love is a direction which excludes all other directions . It 's a freedom TOGETHER , if you like . '

69939	70021	69936	69936	he	1957	' You want the state of chaos , that 's all . It is ultimate nihilism , this freedom - in - love business , this freedom which is love and love which is freedom . As a matter of fact , if you enter into a pure unison , it is irrevocable , and it is never pure till it is irrevocable . And when it is irrevocable , it is one way , like the path of a star . '
70022	70025	70026	70026	she	1956	' Ha ! '
70030	70038	70026	70026	she	1956	' It is the old dead morality . '

70046	70099	70043	70043	he	1957	' it is the law of creation . One is committed . One must commit oneself to a conjunction with the other - for ever . But it is not selfless - it is a maintaining of the self in mystic balance and integrity - like a star balanced with another star . '

74006	74158	73993	73993	She	352	' There was absolutely nowhere to sit down , nowhere , a man just above sang " Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep " the WHOLE way ; he was blind and he had a small organ , one of those portable organs , and he expected money ; so you can imagine what THAT was like ; there came a constant smell of luncheon from below , and puffs of hot oily machinery ; the journey took hours and hours and hours ; and for miles , literally for miles , dreadful boys ran with us on the shore , in that AWFUL Thames mud , going in UP TO THE WAIST - they had their trousers turned back , and they went up to their hips in that indescribable Thames mud , their faces always turned to us , and screaming , exactly like carrion creatures , screaming " '

74341	74382	74384	74384	Gudrun	352	' And it 's not that - it 's the QUALITY of the whole thing - paterfamilias laughing and thinking it sport , and throwing the ha'pennies , and materfamilias spreading her fat little knees and eating , continually eating - '
74386	74389	74391	74391	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
74393	74421	74391	74391	Ursula	264	' It is n't the boys so much who are vermin ; it 's the people themselves , the whole body politic , as you call it . '

74433	74442	74430	74430	he	264	' You sha n't go on the launch . '

74550	74555	74557	74557	Gerald	264	' To get out ? '
74559	74563	74565	74565	Gudrun	352	' You see , '
74574	74589	74565	74565	Gudrun	352	' we do n't know the people , we are almost COMPLETE strangers here . '
74590	74604	74605	74605	he	264	' Oh , I can soon set you up with a few acquaintances , '
74629	74632	74633	74633	she	352	' Ah , '
74636	74655	74656	74656	She	352	' you know what we mean . Ca n't we go up there , and explore that coast ? '
74679	74717	74656	74656	She	352	' That looks perfectly lovely . We might even bathe . Is n't it beautiful in this light . Really , it 's like one of the reaches of the Nile - as one imagines the Nile . '

74739	74748	74656	74656	She	352	' he asked ironically , adding at once : '

74816	74828	74814	74814	Gudrun	352	' we could just drink a cup , and be off . '

74869	74873	74865	74865	Gudrun	352	' pretty well . '

74895	74930	74865	74865	Gudrun	352	' You can ? There 's light little canoe of mine , that I did n't take out for fear somebody should drown themselves . Do you think you 'd be safe in that ? '

74969	74972	74974	74974	Gudrun	352	' Sure , '
74976	74986	74988	74988	Ursula	264	' Besides , we can both swim quite well , '
74990	75025	74865	74865	Gudrun	352	' Well - then I 'll get them to put you up a tea - basket , and you can picnic all to yourselves , - that 's the idea , is n't it ? '
75026	75038	75040	75040	Gudrun	352	' How fearfully good ! How frightfully nice if you could ! '
75073	75078	75079	75079	he	2113	' Where 's Birkin ? '
75086	75096	75082	75082	his	2113	' He might help me to get it down . '
75097	75109	75111	75111	Gudrun	352	' But what about your hand ? Is n't it hurt ? '
75188	75206	75207	75207	he	2113	' Oh I can manage with one hand . The canoe is as light as a feather , '

75281	75288	75279	75279	Ursula	264	' And did it hurt much ? '
75289	75292	75293	75293	he	2113	' Yes , '
75296	75314	75293	75293	he	2113	' It did at the time . It 's getting better now . It crushed the fingers . '
75315	75318	75320	75320	Ursula	264	' Oh , '
75327	75340	75320	75320	Ursula	264	' I hate people who hurt themselves . I can FEEL it . '

75398	75431	75396	75396	Gudrun	352	' I would n't be so mean as to take it , if there was the slightest doubt . But I 've had a canoe at Arundel , and I assure you I 'm

76478	76498	76500	76500	Ursula	264	' Oh Dalcroze ! I could n't catch the name . DO - I should love to see you , '
76507	76513	76500	76500	Ursula	264	' What shall I sing ? '
76514	76529	76545	76545	she	352	' Sing anything you like , and I 'll take the rhythm from it . '
76556	76567	76545	76545	she	352	' My love - is a high - born lady - '
76771	76793	76796	76796	Ursula	264	' My love is a high - born lady - She is - s - s - rather dark than shady - '
76890	76893	76882	76882	Gudrun	352	' Ursula ! '
76894	76897	76899	76899	Ursula	264	' Yes ? '
76927	76930	76932	76932	Ursula	264	' Ugh ! '

76949	76956	76909	76909	Gudrun	352	' rang out Gudrun 's sardonic voice .
77015	77022	77024	77024	Ursula	264	' Wo n't they do anything ? '
77061	77070	77072	77072	Gudrun	352	' Do n't they look charming , Ursula ? '
77089	77092	77094	77094	Ursula	264	' Charming , '
77098	77108	77094	77094	Ursula	264	' But wo n't they do anything to us ? '
77126	77128	77123	77123	her	352	' I 'm
77134	77171	77130	77130	they	2171	' she said , as if she had to convince herself also , and yet , as if she were confident of some secret power in herself , and had to put it to the test . '
77178	77187	77130	77130	they	2171	' she called in her high , strident voice .
77188	77190	77123	77123	her	352	' I 'm
77193	77245	77123	77123	her	352	' cried Ursula , in a pathetic voice , watching the group of sturdy short cattle , that stood with their knees planted , and watched with their dark , wicked eyes , through the matted fringe of their hair . Nevertheless , she sank down again , in her former posture .
77246	77252	77254	77254	Gudrun	352	' They are quite safe , '
77259	77270	77254	77254	Gudrun	352	' Sing something , you 've only to sing something . '
77299	77305	77288	77288	Ursula	264	' Way down in Tennessee - '
77603	77610	77597	77597	its	2176	' Hue ! Hi - eee ! '
77682	77688	77713	77713	Gudrun	352	' What do you think you 're
77691	77703	77713	77713	Gudrun	352	' he now called , in a high , wondering vexed tone .
77704	77710	77713	77713	Gudrun	352	' Why have you come ? '
77720	77729	77730	77730	Gerald	264	' What do you think you were doing ? '
77737	77743	77745	77745	Ursula	264	' We were doing eurythmics , '
77797	77803	77804	77804	Gerald	264	' Where are you going ? '
77844	77852	77854	77854	Birkin	179	' A poor song for a dance , '
77937	77946	77947	77947	she	352	' I think we 've all gone mad , '
77954	77961	77962	77962	he	264	' Pity we are n't madder , '
78008	78012	78013	78013	he	264	' Offended - ? '
78025	78034	78013	78013	he	264	' I thought you liked the light fantastic . '
78035	78040	78041	78041	she	352	' Not like that , '
78116	78122	78123	78123	he	264	' Why not like that ? '
78187	78193	78194	78194	she	352	' No , do n't ! '
78200	78205	78206	78206	he	264	' Cordelia after all , '
78234	78238	78239	78239	she	352	' And you , '
78244	78260	78239	78239	she	352	' why do you always take your soul in your mouth , so frightfully full ? '
78261	78273	78274	78274	he	264	' So that I can spit it out the more readily , '
78468	78478	78480	78480	Gerald	264	' Why do you want to drive them mad ? '
78501	78510	78511	78511	he	264	' It 's not safe , you know , '
78514	78516	78511	78511	he	264	' They 're

78537	78540	78541	78541	he	264	' No , '
78544	78549	78541	78541	he	264	' turn against you . '
78550	78555	78556	78556	she	352	' Turn against ME ? '
78566	78584	78585	78585	he	264	' Anyway , they gored one of the farmer 's cows to death , the other day , '
78588	78594	78595	78595	she	352	' What do I care ? '
78598	78603	78604	78604	he	264	' I cared though , '
78607	78611	78604	78604	he	264	' seeing that they 're
78615	78615	78604	78604	he	264	'
78616	78635	78636	78636	she	352	' How are they yours ! You have n't swallowed them . Give me one of them now , '
78644	78651	78652	78652	he	264	' You know where they are , '
78660	78676	78652	78652	he	264	' You can have one if you 'd like it sent to you later on . '
78683	78687	78677	78677	She	352	' You think I 'm
78699	78702	78677	78677	She	352	' she asked .
78718	78725	78726	78726	he	264	' Why should I think that ? '
78769	78774	78775	78775	she	352	' That 's why , '
78895	78903	78904	78904	he	264	' You have struck the first blow , '
78939	78947	78948	78948	she	352	' And I shall strike the last , '
78993	79005	78966	78966	She	352	' Why ARE you behaving in this IMPOSSIBLE and ridiculous fashion . '
79064	79078	79079	79079	she	352	' It 's you who make me behave like this , you know , '
79085	79090	79091	79091	he	264	' I ? How ? '
79236	79244	79223	79223	she	352	' Do n't be angry with me . '
79260	79262	79268	79268	I	0	' I 'm
79269	79275	79292	79292	She	352	'm in love with you . '
79303	79312	79313	79313	she	352	' That 's one way of putting it , '
79357	79368	79369	79369	he	264	' It 's all right , then , is it ? '
79396	79404	79405	79405	she	352	' Yes , it 's all right , '
79484	79492	79493	79493	he	264	' Do you smell this little marsh ? '
79513	79519	79520	79520	she	352	' It 's rather nice , '
79523	79526	79527	79527	he	264	' No , '
79530	79533	79527	79527	he	264	' alarming . '
79534	79538	79539	79539	she	352	' Why alarming ? '
79542	79553	79554	79554	he	264	' It seethes and seethes , a river of darkness , '
79557	79590	79554	79554	he	264	' putting forth lilies and snakes , and the ignis fatuus , and rolling all the time onward . That 's what we never take into count - that it rolls onwards . '
79591	79595	79527	79527	he	264	' What does ? '
79596	79652	79554	79554	he	264	' The other river , the black river . We always consider the silver river of life , rolling on and quickening all the world to a brightness , on and on to heaven , flowing into a bright eternal sea , a heaven of angels thronging . But the other is our real reality - '
79653	79665	79667	79667	Ursula	264	' But what other ? I do n't see any other , '
79669	79677	79678	79678	he	264	' It is your reality , nevertheless , '
79681	79734	79678	79678	he	264	' that dark river of dissolution . You see it rolls in us just as the other rolls - the black river of corruption . And our flowers are of this - our sea - born Aphrodite , all our white phosphorescent flowers of sensuous perfection , all our reality , nowadays . '
79735	79744	79746	79746	Ursula	264	' You mean that Aphrodite is really deathly ? '
79748	79764	79765	79765	he	264	' I mean she is the flowering mystery of the death - process , yes , '
79768	79828	79765	79765	he	264	' When the stream of synthetic creation lapses , we find ourselves part of the inverse process , the blood of destructive creation . Aphrodite is born in the first spasm of universal dissolution - then the snakes and swans and lotus - marsh - flowers - and Gudrun and Gerald - born in the process of destructive creation . '
79829	79836	79837	79837	she	2200	' And you and me - ? '
79840	79843	79844	79844	he	264	' Probably , '
79847	79867	79844	79844	he	264	' In part , certainly . Whether we are that , in toto , I do n't yet know . '
79868	79890	79891	79891	she	2200	' You mean we are flowers of dissolution - fleurs du mal ? I do n't feel as if I were , '
79901	79913	79914	79914	he	264	' I do n't feel as if we were , ALTOGETHER , '
79917	79964	79914	79914	he	264	' Some people are pure flowers of dark corruption - lilies . But there ought to be some roses , warm and flamy . You know Herakleitos says " a dry soul is best . " I know so well what that means . Do you ? '
79965	79967	79844	79844	he	264	' I 'm
79971	79975	79844	79844	he	264	' Ursula replied . '
79988	79999	79914	79914	he	264	're flowers at all - what difference does it make ? '
80000	80018	80019	80019	he	264	' No difference - and all the difference . Dissolution rolls on , just as production does , '
80022	80061	80019	80019	he	264	' It is a progressive process - and it ends in universal nothing - the end of the world , if you like . But why is n't the end of the world as good as the beginning ? '
80062	80069	80071	80071	Ursula	264	' I suppose it is n't , '
80076	80082	80083	80083	he	264	' Oh yes , ultimately , '
80086	80140	80083	80083	he	264	' It means a new cycle of creation after - but not for us . If it is the end , then we are of the end - fleurs du mal if you like . If we are fleurs du mal , we are not roses of happiness , and there you are . '
80141	80148	80150	80150	Ursula	264	' But I think I am , '
80152	80162	80150	80150	Ursula	264	' I think I am a rose of happiness . '
80163	80168	80169	80169	he	264	' Ready - made ? '
80173	80178	80179	80179	she	2202	' No - real , '
80184	80197	80198	80198	he	264	' If we are the end , we are not the beginning , '
80201	80206	80207	80207	she	2202	' Yes we are , '
80210	80219	80207	80207	she	2202	' The beginning comes out of the end . '
80220	80237	80198	80198	he	264	' After it , not out of it . After us , not out of us . '
80238	80249	80250	80250	she	2202	' You are a devil , you know , really , '
80253	80268	80250	80250	she	2202	' You want to destroy our hope . You WANT US to be deathly . '
80269	80272	80273	80273	he	264	' No , '
80276	80287	80273	80273	he	264	' I only want us to KNOW what we are . '
80288	80291	80292	80292	she	2202	' Ha ! '
80297	80306	80292	80292	she	2202	' You only want us to know death . '
80307	80309	80273	80273	he	264	' You 're
80313	80326	80273	80273	he	264	' said the soft voice of Gerald , out of the dusk behind .
80792	80798	80800	80800	his	2202	' That is all right , '
80829	80834	80835	80835	she	179	' This is beautiful , '
80838	80841	80843	80843	Gudrun	352	' Lovely , '
80860	80866	80867	80867	she	179	' Light one for me , '
80949	80962	80935	80935	Gudrun	352	' Is n't it beautiful , oh , is n't it beautiful ! '
81099	81114	81116	81116	Birkin	179	' You 've got the heavens above , and the waters under the earth , '
81120	81127	81128	81128	she	179	' Anything but the earth itself , '
81143	81145	81128	81128	she	179	' I 'm
81155	81174	81128	81128	she	179	' cried Gudrun , in a vibrating rather strident voice , that seemed to repel the others from her .
81234	81239	81241	81241	Gudrun	352	' How truly terrifying ! '
81260	81268	81269	81269	she	179	' But is n't it really fearful ! '
81281	81291	81275	81275	he	264	' Change it with Ursula , for the crabs . '
81299	81302	81303	81303	she	179	' Ursula , '
81306	81316	81303	81303	she	179	' could you bear to have this fearful thing ? '
81317	81325	81327	81327	Ursula	264	' I think the colouring is LOVELY , '
81329	81334	81336	81336	Gudrun	352	' So do I , '
81338	81361	81336	81336	Gudrun	352	' But could you BEAR to have it swinging to your boat ? Do n't you want to destroy it at ONCE ? '
81362	81366	81368	81368	Ursula	264	' Oh no , '
81370	81379	81368	81368	Ursula	264	' I do n't want to destroy it . '
81380	81400	81336	81336	Gudrun	352	' Well do you mind having it instead of the crabs ? Are you sure you do n't mind ? '
81408	81411	81413	81413	Ursula	264	' No , '
81452	81456	81458	81458	Birkin	179	' Come then , '
81460	81469	81458	81458	Birkin	179	' I 'll put them on the boats . '
81481	81492	81494	81494	Gerald	264	' I suppose you 'll row me back , Rupert , '
81505	81516	81518	81518	Birkin	179	' Wo n't you go with Gudrun in the canoe ? '
81520	81527	81518	81518	Birkin	179	' It 'll be more interesting . '
81558	81564	81566	81566	Gudrun	352	' Is that all right ? '
81570	81578	81579	81579	he	264	' It 'll suit ME very well , '
81582	81602	81579	81579	he	264	' But what about you , and the rowing ? I do n't see why you should pull me . '
81603	81607	81608	81608	she	352	' Why not ? '
81611	81624	81608	81608	she	352	' I can pull you as well as I could pull Ursula . '
81711	81718	81720	81720	his	264	' Kiss me before we go , '
81740	81744	81745	81745	she	352	' But why ? '
81752	81755	81756	81756	he	264	' Why ? '
81833	81847	81848	81848	she	352	' Are you sure you do n't hurt your hand , doing that ? '
81853	81862	81848	81848	she	352	' Because I could have done it PERFECTLY . '
81863	81870	81871	81871	he	264	' I do n't hurt myself , '
81942	81950	81951	81951	she	352	' You like this , do you ? '
81965	81973	81974	81974	he	264	' There is a space between us , '
82020	82023	82012	82012	She	352	' But I 'm
82027	82033	82012	82012	She	352	' she said caressively , gaily .
82034	82040	82041	82041	he	264	' Yet distant , distant , '
82063	82079	82080	82080	She	352	' Yet we can not very well change , whilst we are on the water . '
82309	82315	82316	82316	she	352	' Is n't it beautiful ! '
82492	82495	82496	82496	he	264	' Yes , '
82500	82506	82496	82496	he	264	' It is very beautiful . '
82657	82667	82669	82669	Gudrun	352	' Shall I row to the landing - stage ? '
82672	82675	82676	82676	he	264	' Anywhere , '
82679	82684	82676	82676	he	264	' Let it drift . '
82685	82697	82698	82698	she	352	' Tell me then , if we are running into anything , '
82712	82718	82719	82719	he	264	' The lights will show , '
82752	82758	82759	82759	she	352	' Nobody will miss you ? '
82767	82771	82772	82772	he	264	' Miss me ? '
82775	82780	82772	82772	he	264	' No ! Why ? '
82781	82792	82740	82740	she	352	' I wondered if anybody would be looking for you . '
82793	82801	82772	82772	he	264	' Why should they look for me ? '
82809	82818	82819	82819	he	264	' But perhaps you want to get back , '
82827	82838	82839	82839	she	352	' No , I do n't want to get back , '
82842	82849	82839	82839	she	352	' No , I assure you . '
82850	82852	82881	82881	somebody	5472	' You 're
82862	82862	82881	82881	somebody	5472	'
82863	82868	82881	82881	somebody	5472	' Perfectly all right . '

86799	86865	86795	86795	she	2339	' I do n't know . So that it is like death - I DO want to die from this life - and yet it is more than life itself .

87066	87138	87063	87063	he	2325	' I do n't want to know you . I want to be gone out of myself , and you to be lost to yourself , so we are found different . One should n't talk when one is tired and wretched . One Hamletises , and it seems a lie . Only believe me when I show you a bit of healthy pride and insouciance . I hate myself serious . '
87139	87147	87148	87148	she	2358	' Why should n't you be serious ? '
87163	87169	87158	87158	he	2325	' I do n't know . '
87186	87192	87193	87193	she	2358	' Is n't it strange , '
87209	87229	87193	87193	she	2358	' how we always talk like this ! I suppose we do love each other , in some way . '
87230	87234	87235	87235	he	2325	' Oh yes , '
87238	87242	87235	87235	he	2325	' too much . '
87248	87263	87264	87264	she	2358	' You 'd have to have it your own way , would n't you ? '

87648	87664	87665	87665	he	2325	' I was becoming quite dead - alive , nothing but a word - bag , '
87806	87813	87814	87814	he	2325	' You still here , Rupert ? '
87817	87880	87814	87814	he	2325	' We ca n't get them . The bottom slopes , you know , very steep . The water lies between two very sharp slopes , with little branch valleys , and God knows where the drift will take you . It is n't as if it was a level bottom . You never know where you are , with the dragging . '
87881	87892	87894	87894	Birkin	179	' Is there any need for you to be working ? '

87910	87927	87814	87814	he	2325	' To bed ! Good God , do you think I should sleep ? We 'll find 'em

87937	87955	87963	87963	he	264	' But the men would find them just the same without you - why should you insist ? '
87975	88008	87963	87963	he	264	' Do n't you bother about me , Rupert . If there 's anybody 's health to think about , it 's yours , not mine . How do you feel yourself ? '
88009	88030	87963	87963	he	264	' Very well . But you , you spoil your own chance of life - you waste your best self . '
88042	88055	88039	88039	he	264	' Waste it ? What else is there to do with it ? '
88056	88088	88103	88103	he	264	' But leave this , wo n't you ? You force yourself into horrors , and put a mill - stone of beastly memories round your neck . Come away now . '

91628	91636	91554	91554	Ursula	264	' It 's the accusative of who . '
91649	91653	91554	91554	Ursula	264	' Is it ? '
91727	91734	91735	91735	she	2493	' Do n't you feel well ? '

91817	91828	91775	91775	he	304	' But do n't you think that 's very wicked ? '
91829	91832	91862	91862	He	304	' Wicked ? '
91833	91861	91775	91775	he	304	' Yes . I think it 's CRIMINAL to have so little connection with your own body that you do n't even know when you are ill . '
91868	91871	91872	91872	he	304	' Yes , '
91875	91893	91862	91862	He	304	' Why do n't you stay in bed when you are seedy ? You look perfectly ghastly . '
91894	91898	91899	91899	he	304	' Offensively so ? '
91903	91912	91862	91862	He	304	' Yes , quite offensive . Quite repelling . '
91913	91922	91862	91862	He	304	' Ah ! ! Well that 's unfortunate . '
91923	91968	91862	91862	He	304	' And it 's raining , and it 's a horrible night . Really , you should n't be forgiven for treating your body like it - you OUGHT to suffer , a man who takes as little notice of his body as that . '
91969	91981	91982	91982	he	304	' - takes as little notice of his body as that , '

92038	92047	92033	92033	Brangwen	352	' Came to see me , did you ? '
92048	92051	92053	92053	Birkin	179	' No , '
92055	92083	92053	92053	Birkin	179	' not about anything , in particular , that is . The day was dismal , and I thought you would n't mind if I called in . '
92084	92092	92094	92095	Mrs Brangwen	287	' It HAS been a depressing day , '
92112	92117	92118	92118	She	287	' Mother ! Mother ! '

92147	92160	92161	92161	she	287	' There is nothing fresh at Shortlands , I suppose ? Ah , '
92164	92175	92161	92161	she	287	' no , poor things , I should think not . '

92192	92218	92161	92161	she	287	' Gerald came round to tea with me , and I walked back with him . The house is overexcited and unwholesome , I thought . '
92219	92232	92234	92234	Gudrun	352	' I should think they were people who had n't much restraint , '
92236	92241	92242	92242	Birkin	179	' Or too much , '
92245	92250	92161	92161	she	287	' Oh yes , I 'm
92253	92260	92161	92161	she	287	' said Gudrun , almost vindictively , '
92266	92266	92161	92161	she	287	'
92267	92280	92282	92282	Birkin	179	' They all feel they ought to behave in some unnatural fashion , '
92284	92310	92282	92282	Birkin	179	' When people are in grief , they would do better to cover their faces and keep in retirement , as in the old days . '
92311	92314	92316	92316	Gudrun	352	' Certainly ! '
92322	92352	92316	92316	Gudrun	352	' What can be worse than this public grief - what is more horrible , more false ! If GRIEF is not private , and hidden , what is ? '
92353	92356	92357	92357	he	659	' Exactly , '
92360	92389	92357	92357	he	659	' I felt ashamed when I was there and they were all going about in a lugubrious false way , feeling they must not be natural or ordinary . '
92390	92393	92395	92396	Mrs Brangwen	287	' Well - '
92403	92416	92395	92396	Mrs Brangwen	287	' it is n't so easy to bear a trouble like that . '
94372	94380	94381	94381	he	264	' Why are you laid up again ? '
94409	94417	94418	94418	Birkin	179	' For my sins , I suppose , '
94426	94449	94418	94418	Birkin	179	' For your sins ? Yes , probably that is so . You should sin less , and keep better in health ? '
94450	94457	94458	94458	He	264	' You 'd better teach me . '
94466	94473	94475	94475	Birkin	179	' How are things with you ? '
94477	94481	94482	94482	Gerald	264	' With me ? '
94501	94508	94482	94482	Gerald	264	' I do n't know that they 're
94527	94527	94485	94485	Birkin	179	'
94528	94549	94485	94485	Birkin	179	' I suppose you are conducting the business as successfully as ever , and ignoring the demand of the soul . '
94550	94555	94557	94557	Gerald	264	' That 's it , '
94559	94581	94557	94557	Gerald	264	' At least as far as the business is concerned . I could n't say about the soul , I'am sure . '
94582	94585	94485	94485	Birkin	179	' No . '
94586	94595	94597	94597	Gerald	264	' Surely you do n't expect me to ? '
94599	94616	94485	94485	Birkin	179	' No . How are the rest of your affairs progressing , apart from the business ? '
94617	94642	94485	94485	Birkin	179	' The rest of my affairs ? What are those ? I could n't say ; I do n't know what you refer to . '
94643	94649	94651	94651	Birkin	179	' Yes , you do , '
94653	94666	94651	94651	Birkin	179	' Are you gloomy or cheerful ? And what about Gudrun Brangwen ? '
94667	94672	94678	94678	Gerald	264	' What about her ? '
94680	94683	94684	94684	he	264	' Well , '
94687	94712	94684	94684	he	264	' I do n't know . I can only tell you she gave me a hit over the face last time I saw her . '
94713	94723	94485	94485	Birkin	179	' A hit over the face ! What for ? '
94724	94734	94684	94684	he	264	' That I could n't tell you , either . '
94735	94741	94485	94485	Birkin	179	' Really ! But when ? '
94742	94772	94684	94684	he	264	' The night of the party - when Diana was drowned . She was driving the cattle up the hill , and I went after her - you remember . '
94773	94798	94485	94485	Birkin	179	' Yes , I remember . But what made her do that ? You did n't definitely ask her for it , I suppose ? '
94799	94846	94684	94684	he	264	' I ? No , not that I know of . I merely said to her , that it was dangerous to drive those Highland bullocks - as it IS . She turned in such a way , and said - " I suppose you think I 'm
94881	94881	94870	94870	she	2584	'
94908	94931	94892	94892	Gerald	264	' I did n't laugh at the time , I assure you . I was never so taken aback in my life . '
94932	94939	94892	94892	Gerald	264	' And were n't you furious ? '
94940	94958	94892	94892	Gerald	264	' Furious ? I should think I was . I 'd have murdered her for two pins . '
94959	94962	94964	94964	Birkin	179	' H'm ! '
94966	94981	94982	94982	He	2583	' Poor Gudrun , would n't she suffer afterwards for having given herself away ! '
94987	94992	94994	94994	Gerald	264	' Would she suffer ? '
95008	95023	94892	94892	Gerald	264	' Badly , I should think ; seeing how self - conscious she is . '
95024	95056	95090	95090	Birkin	179	' She is self - conscious , is she ? Then what made her do it ? For I certainly think it was quite uncalled - for , and quite unjustified . '
95057	95066	94892	94892	Gerald	264	' I suppose it was a sudden impulse . '
95067	95089	95090	95090	Birkin	179	' Yes , but how do you account for her having such an impulse ? I 'd done her no harm . '
95095	95107	95108	95108	he	2583	' The Amazon suddenly came up in her , I suppose , '
95111	95114	95116	95116	Gerald	264	' Well , '
95118	95128	95116	95116	Gerald	264	' I 'd rather it had been the Orinoco . '
95163	95169	95170	95170	Birkin	179	' And you resent it ? '
95173	95191	95192	95192	He	264	' I do n't resent it . I do n't care a tinker 's curse about it . '
95204	95222	95199	95199	he	264	' No , I 'll see it through , that 's all . She seemed sorry afterwards . '
95223	95235	95199	95199	he	264	' Did she ? You 've not met since that night ? '
95241	95244	95245	95245	he	264	' No , '
95248	95265	95245	95245	he	264	' We 've been - you can imagine how it 's been , since the accident . '
95266	95274	95199	95199	he	264	' Yes . Is it calming down ? '
95275	95351	95245	95245	he	264	' I do n't know . It 's a shock , of course . But I do n't believe mother minds . I really do n't believe she takes any notice . And what 's so funny , she used to be all for the children - nothing mattered , nothing whatever mattered but the children . And now , she does n't take any more notice than if it was one of the servants . '
95352	95362	95199	95199	he	264	' No ? Did it upset YOU very much ? '
95363	95435	95245	95245	he	264	' It 's a shock . But I do n't feel it very much , really . I do n't feel any different . We 've all got to die , and it does n't seem to make any great difference , anyhow , whether you die or not . I ca n't feel any GRIEF you know . It leaves me cold . I ca n't quite account for it . '
95436	95447	95449	95449	Birkin	179	' You do n't care if you die or not ? '
95491	95494	95495	95495	he	264	' Oh , '
95498	95539	95495	95495	he	264	' I do n't want to die , why should I ? But I never trouble . The question does n't seem to be on the carpet for me at all . It does n't interest me , you know . '
95540	95546	95548	95548	Birkin	179	' TIMOR MORTIS CONTURBAT ME , '
95552	95579	95548	95548	Birkin	179	' No , death does n't really seem the point any more . It curiously does n't concern one . It 's like an ordinary tomorrow . '
95640	95648	95649	95649	he	264	' If death is n't the point , '
95662	95666	95667	95667	He	264	' what is ? '
95677	95681	95685	95685	Birkin	179	' What is ? '
95694	95713	95715	95715	Birkin	179	' There 's long way to go , after the point of intrinsic death , before we disappear , '
95717	95721	95723	95723	Gerald	264	' There is , '
95725	95732	95733	95733	He	264	' But what sort of way ? '
95752	95793	95733	95733	He	264	' Right down the slopes of degeneration - mystic , universal degeneration . There are many stages of pure degradation to go through : agelong . We live on long after our death , and progressively , in progressive devolution . '
95902	95906	95907	95907	he	264	' Of course , '
95917	95987	95907	95907	he	264	' it is father who really feels it . It will finish him . For him the world collapses . All his care now is for Winnie - he must save Winnie . He says she ought to be sent away to school , but she wo n't hear of it , and he 'll never do it . Of course she IS in rather a queer way . We 're
96020	96020	96016	96017	a family	2593	'
96021	96032	96034	96034	Birkin	179	' She ought n't to be sent away to school , '
96043	96050	96034	96034	Birkin	179	' She ought n't . Why ? '
96051	96098	96016	96017	a family	2593	' She 's a queer child - a special child , more special even than you . And in my opinion special children should never be sent away to school . Only moderately ordinary children should be sent to school - so it seems to me . '
96099	96101	96034	96034	Birkin	179	' I 'm
96128	96128	96109	96109	I	0	'
96129	96184	96016	96017	a family	2593	' She would n't mix , you see . YOU never really mixed , did you ? And she would n't be willing even to pretend to . She 's proud , and solitary , and naturally apart . If she has a single nature , why do you want to make her gregarious ? '
96185	96207	96109	96109	I	0	' No , I do n't want to make her anything . But I think school would be good for her . '
96208	96215	96016	96017	a family	2593	' Was it good for you ? '
96253	96269	96270	96270	he	264	' I hated it at the time , but I can see it was necessary , '
96273	96295	96270	96270	he	264	' It brought me into line a bit - and you ca n't live unless you do come into line somewhere . '
96296	96299	96301	96301	Birkin	179	' Well , '
96303	96360	96301	96301	Birkin	179	' I begin to think that you ca n't live unless you keep entirely out of the line . It 's no good trying to toe the line , when your one impulse is to smash up the line . Winnie is a special nature , and for special natures you must give a special world . '
96361	96371	96373	96373	Gerald	264	' Yes , but where 's your special world ? '
96375	96474	96301	96301	Birkin	179	' Make it . Instead of chopping yourself down to fit the world , chop the world down to fit yourself . As a matter of fact , two exceptional people make another world . You and I , we make another , separate world . You do n't WANT a world same as your brothers - in - law . It 's just the special quality you value . Do you WANT to be normal or ordinary ! It 's a lie . You want to be free and extraordinary , in an extraordinary world of liberty . '
96543	96557	96559	96559	Birkin	179	' Yet you are so banal as to consider me chiefly a freak , '
96562	96566	96568	96568	Gerald	264	' A freak ! '
96595	96605	96607	96607	he	264	' No - I never consider you a freak . '
96622	96626	96627	96627	Gerald	264	' I feel , '
96630	96651	96627	96627	Gerald	264	' that there is always an element of uncertainty about you - perhaps you are uncertain about yourself . But I 'm
96672	96672	96673	96673	He	264	'
96909	96923	96924	96924	he	264	' You know how the old German knights used to swear a BLUTBRUDERSCHAFT , '
96939	96958	96960	96960	Gerald	264	' Make a little wound in their arms , and rub each other 's blood into the cut ? '
96962	97027	97028	97028	He	264	' Yes - and swear to be true to each other , of one blood , all their lives . That is what we ought to do . No wounds , that is obsolete . But we ought to swear to love each other , you and I , implicitly , and perfectly , finally , without any possibility of going back on it . '
97068	97082	97084	97084	Birkin	179	' We will swear to each other , one day , shall we ? '
97086	97119	97084	97084	Birkin	179	' We will swear to stand by each other - be true to each other - ultimately - infallibly - given to each other , organically - without possibility of taking back . '
97156	97167	97169	97169	Birkin	179	' Shall we swear to each other , one day ? '
97194	97205	97206	97206	he	264	' We 'll leave it till I understand it better , '
97234	97237	97238	97238	he	264	' Yes , '
97241	97270	97238	97238	he	264	' You must tell me what you think , later . You know what I mean ? Not sloppy emotionalism . An impersonal union that leaves one free . '
97450	97465	97434	97434	Birkin	179	' Ca n't you get a good governess for Winifred ? - somebody exceptional ? '
97466	97503	97504	97504	Gerald	264	' Hermione Roddice suggested we should ask Gudrun to teach her to draw and to model in clay . You know Winnie is astonishingly clever with that plasticine stuff . Hermione declares she is an artist . '
97530	97583	97522	97522	Birkin	179	' Really ! I did n't know that . Oh well then , if Gudrun WOULD teach her , it would be perfect - could n't be anything better - if Winifred is an artist . Because Gudrun somewhere is one . And every true artist is the salvation of every other . '
97584	97597	97522	97522	Birkin	179	' I thought they got on so badly , as a rule . '
97598	97629	97522	97522	Birkin	179	' Perhaps . But only artists produce for each other the world that is fit to live in . If you can arrange THAT for Winifred , it is perfect . '
97630	97639	97522	97522	Birkin	179	' But you think she would n't come ? '
97640	97813	97522	97522	Birkin	179	' I do n't know . Gudrun is rather self - opinionated . She wo n't go cheap anywhere . Or if she does , she 'll pretty soon take herself back . So whether she would condescend to do private teaching , particularly here , in Beldover , I do n't know . But it would be just the thing . Winifred has got a special nature . And if you can put into her way the means of being self - sufficient , that is the best thing possible . She 'll never get on with the ordinary life . You find it difficult enough yourself , and she is several skins thinner than you are . It is awful to think what her life will be like unless she does find a means of expression , some way of fulfilment . You can see what mere leaving it to fate brings . You can see how much marriage is to be trusted to - look at your own mother . '
97814	97822	97992	97992	each	2576	' Do you think mother is abnormal ? '
97823	97854	97522	97522	Birkin	179	' No ! I think she only wanted something more , or other than the common run of life . And not getting it , she has gone wrong perhaps . '
97855	97864	97866	97866	Gerald	264	' After producing a brood of wrong children , '
97869	97881	97882	97882	Birkin	179	' No more wrong than any of the rest of us , '
97885	97902	97882	97882	Birkin	179	' The most normal people have the worst subterranean selves , take them one by one . '
97903	97915	97917	97917	Gerald	264	' Sometimes I think it is a curse to be alive , '
97923	97926	97928	97928	Birkin	179	' Well , '
97930	97964	97928	97928	Birkin	179	' why not ! Let it be a curse sometimes to be alive - at other times it is anything but a curse . You 've got plenty of zest in it really . '
97965	97972	97974	97974	Gerald	264	' Less than you 'd think , '
97998	98021	98023	98023	Gerald	264	' I do n't see what she has to distinguish between teaching at the Grammar School , and coming to teach Win , '
98025	98070	98023	98023	Gerald	264	' The difference between a public servant and a private one . The only nobleman today , king and only aristocrat , is the public , the public . You are quite willing to serve the public - but to be a private tutor - '
98071	98080	98101	98101	he	264	' I do n't want to serve either - '
98081	98092	98023	98023	Gerald	264	' No ! And Gudrun will probably feel the same . '
98104	98128	98101	98101	he	264	' At all events , father wo n't make her feel like a private servant . He will be fussy and greatful enough . '
98129	98166	98101	98101	he	264	' So he ought . And so ought all of you . Do you think you can hire a woman like Gudrun Brangwen with money ? She is your equal like anything - probably your superior . '
98167	98171	98173	98173	Gerald	264	' Is she ? '
98175	98200	98101	98101	he	264	' Yes , and if you have n't the guts to know it , I hope she 'll leave you to your own devices . '
98201	98204	98206	98206	Gerald	264	' Nevertheless , '
98208	98236	98206	98206	Gerald	264	' if she is my equal , I wish she were n't a teacher , because I do n't think teachers as a rule are my equal . '
98237	98261	98101	98101	he	264	' Nor do I , damn them . But am I a teacher because I teach , or a parson because I preach ? '
98354	98365	98366	98366	he	264	' I 've been neglecting my business all this while , '
98370	98379	98380	98380	Birkin	179	' I ought to have reminded you before , '
98387	98397	98399	98399	Gerald	264	' I knew you 'd say something like that , '
98404	98408	98380	98380	Birkin	179	' Did you ? '
98409	98448	98380	98380	Birkin	179	' Yes , Rupert . It would n't do for us all to be like you are - we should soon be in the cart . When I am above the world , I shall ignore all businesses . '
98449	98454	98380	98380	Birkin	179	' Of course , we 're
98461	98466	98380	98380	Birkin	179	' said Birkin , satirically .
98467	98488	98380	98380	Birkin	179	' Not as much as you make out . At any rate , we have enough to eat and drink - '
98489	98494	98496	98496	Birkin	179	' And be satisfied , '
98573	98576	98578	98578	Birkin	179	' So , '
98580	98585	98578	98578	Birkin	179	' Good - bye . '

98641	98651	98653	98653	Birkin	179	' I 'll be there in a few days , '
98719	98734	98686	98686	Birkin	179	' Good - bye then . There 's nothing I can do for you ? '
98735	98740	98686	98686	Birkin	179	' Nothing , thanks . '

99267	99326	99220	99220	her	314	' You do n't ? Ay , well , I suppose you found a difference from London . You like life , and big , grand places . Some of us has to be content with Willey Green and Beldover . And what do you think of our Grammar School , as there 's so much talk about ? '
99327	99335	99336	99336	Gudrun	352	' What do I think of it ? '
99343	99357	99336	99336	Gudrun	352	' Do you mean , do I think it 's a good school ? '
99358	99368	99336	99336	Gudrun	352	' Yes . What is your opinion of it ? '
99369	99379	99336	99336	Gudrun	352	' I DO think it 's a good school . '
99396	99453	99336	99336	Gudrun	352	' Ay , you do , then ! I 've heard so much , one way and the other . It 's nice to know what those that 's in it feel . But opinions vary , do n't they ? Mr Crich up at Highclose is all for it . Ay , poor man , I 'm

99478	99508	99463	99463	He	2637	' Eh , yes - since they lost Miss Diana . He 's gone off to a shadow . Poor man , he 's had a world of trouble . '
99509	99513	99515	99515	Gudrun	352	' Has he ? '
99520	99552	99463	99463	He	2637	' He has , a world of trouble . And as nice and kind a gentleman as ever you could wish to meet . His children do n't take after him . '
99553	99562	99564	99564	Ursula	264	' I suppose they take after their mother ? '
99566	99571	99572	99573	Mrs Krik	315	' In many ways . '
99580	99619	99575	99575	her	315	' She was a proud haughty lady when she came into these parts - my word , she was that ! She must n't be looked at , and it was worth your life to speak to her . '
99629	99640	99620	99621	The woman	882	' Did you know her when she was first married ? '
99641	99687	99696	99697	the woman	882	' Yes , I knew her . I nursed three of her children . And proper little terrors they were , little fiends - that Gerald was a demon if ever there was one , a proper demon , ay , at six months old . '

Many 's the time I 've pinched his little bottom for him , when he was a child in arms . Ay , and he 'd have been better if he 'd had it pinched oftener . But she would n't have them corrected - no - o , would n't hear of it . I can remember the rows she had with Mr Crich , my word . When he 'd got worked up , properly worked up till he could stand no more , he 'd lock the study door and whip them . But she paced up and down all the while like a tiger outside , like a tiger , with very murder in her face . She had a face that could LOOK death . And when the door was opened , she 'd go in with her hands lifted - " What have you been doing to MY children , you coward . " She was like one out of her mind . I believe he was frightened of her ; he had to be driven mad before he 'd lift a finger . Did n't the servants have a life of it ! And did n't we used to be thankful when one of them caught it . They were the torment of your life . '

What have you done to him ? What is it , Darling ? " And then she 'd turn on you as if she 'd trample you under her feet . But she did n't trample on me . I was the only one that could do anything with her demons - for she was n't going to be bothered with them herself . No , SHE took no trouble for them . But they must just have their way , they must n't be spoken to . And Master Gerald was the beauty . I left when he was a year and a half , I could stand no more .

119819	119825	119826	119826	she	3176	' Are you really sad ? '
119831	119834	119835	119835	he	3185	' Yes , '
119838	119850	119835	119835	he	3185	' I wish we could stay as we were , always . '
119851	119857	119858	119858	she	3176	' Always ! Do you ? '
119877	119884	119875	119875	she	3176	' Kiss me ! Kiss me ! '
121123	121147	121148	121148	Rosalind	346	' dwellings , making a great square , and it looked like Jerusalem to his fancy . The world was all strange and transcendent .
121168	121176	121155	121155	She	346	' Oh , I 'll tell father . '
121224	121227	121229	121229	Brangwen	348	' Well , '
121231	121238	121229	121229	Brangwen	348	' I 'll get a coat . '
121263	121287	121248	121248	he	348	' You must excuse me , I was just doing a bit of work in the shed . Come inside , will you . '
121493	121505	121507	121507	Brangwen	348	' The weather 's not so bad as it has been , '
121523	121526	121528	121528	Birkin	179	' No , '
121530	121539	121528	121528	Birkin	179	' It was full moon two days ago . '
121540	121554	121507	121507	Brangwen	348	' Oh ! You believe in the moon then , affecting the weather ? '
121555	121574	121528	121528	Birkin	179	' No , I do n't think I do . I do n't really know enough about it . '
121575	121603	121507	121507	Brangwen	348	' You know what they say ? The moon and the weather may change together , but the change of the moon wo n't change the weather . '
121604	121609	121611	121611	Birkin	179	' Is that it ? '
121613	121620	121611	121611	Birkin	179	' I had n't heard it . '
121630	121649	121627	121627	Birkin	179	' Am I hindering you ? I called to see Ursula , really . Is she at home ? '
121650	121672	121676	121676	him	3231	' I do n't believe she is . I believe she 's gone to the library . I 'll just see . '
121684	121687	121688	121688	he	3231	' No , '
121694	121709	121688	121688	he	3231	' But she wo n't be long . You wanted to speak to her ? '
121724	121731	121732	121732	he	3231	' As a matter of fact , '
121735	121745	121732	121732	he	3231	' I wanted to ask her to marry me . '
121762	121767	121768	121768	he	1610	' O - oh ? '
121790	121797	121768	121768	he	1610	' Was she expecting you then ? '
121798	121801	121803	121803	Birkin	179	' No , '
121805	121820	121821	121821	Brangwen	348	' No ? I did n't know anything of this sort was on foot - '
121836	121848	121825	121825	Birkin	179	' I wonder why it should be " on foot " ! '
121853	121862	121873	121873	he	3231	' No , it 's perhaps rather sudden . '
121876	121883	121873	121873	he	3231	' but I do n't know - '
121884	121893	121895	121895	Brangwen	348	' Quite sudden , is it ? Oh ! '
121902	121907	121909	121909	Birkin	179	' In one way , '
121911	121917	121909	121909	Birkin	179	' - not in another . '
121930	121937	121927	121927	Brangwen	348	' Well , she pleases herself - '
121938	121942	121944	121944	Birkin	179	' Oh yes ! '
121961	121992	121958	121958	he	3231	' Though I should n't want her to be in too big a hurry , either . It 's no good looking round afterwards , when it 's too late . '
121993	122003	122005	122005	Birkin	179	' Oh , it need never be too late , '
122007	122014	122005	122005	Birkin	179	' as far as that goes . '
122015	122021	122023	122024	the father	659	' How do you mean ? '
122026	122040	122042	122042	Birkin	179	' If one repents being married , the marriage is at an end , '
122044	122049	121958	121958	he	3231	' You think so ? '
122050	122053	122076	122076	himself	179	' Yes . '
122054	122068	121958	121958	he	3231	' Ay , well that may be your way of looking at it . '
122078	122101	122069	122069	Birkin	179	' So it may . As for YOUR way of looking at it , William Brangwen , it needs a little explaining . '
122102	122106	122108	122108	Brangwen	304	' I suppose , '
122110	122131	122108	122108	Brangwen	304	' you know what sort of people we are ? What sort of a bringing - up she 's had ? '
122132	122137	122139	122139	Birkin	179	' " She " , '
122149	122156	122141	122141	himself	179	' is the cat 's mother . '
122157	122172	122173	122173	he	3237	' Do I know what sort of a bringing - up she 's had ? '
122184	122187	122188	122188	he	3237	' Well , '
122191	122219	122188	122188	he	3237	' she 's had everything that 's right for a girl to have - as far as possible , as far as we could give it her . '
122220	122222	122141	122141	himself	179	' I 'm
122227	122257	122141	122141	himself	179	' said Birkin , which caused a perilous full - stop . The father was becoming exasperated . There was something naturally irritant to him in Birkin 's mere presence .
122258	122273	122274	122274	he	3237	' And I do n't want to see her going back on it all , '
122282	122285	122287	122287	Birkin	179	' Why ? '
122300	122336	122339	122339	him	3237	' Why ! I do n't believe in your new - fangled ways and new - fangled ideas - in and out like a frog in a gallipot . It would never do for me . '
122355	122368	122370	122370	Birkin	179	' Yes , but are my ways and ideas new - fangled ? '
122372	122376	122377	122377	Brangwen	304	' Are they ? '
122382	122384	122379	122379	himself	304	' I 'm
122392	122396	122398	122398	I	0	' he said . '
122436	122436	122430	122430	them	5450	'
122443	122449	122451	122451	Birkin	179	' And beyond that - ? '
122464	122481	122483	122483	he	659	' Eh ? What do you mean ? All I want to say is that my daughter '
122505	122509	122511	122511	Birkin	179	' Of course , '
122513	122532	122511	122511	Birkin	179	' I do n't want to hurt anybody or influence anybody . Ursula does exactly as she pleases . '
122610	122621	122622	122622	he	1603	' And as for beliefs , that 's one thing , '
122625	122658	122622	122622	he	1603	' But I 'd rather see my daughters dead tomorrow than that they should be at the beck and call of the first man that likes to come and whistle for them . '
122669	122674	122675	122675	he	1603	' As to that , '
122678	122708	122675	122675	he	1603	' I only know that it 's much more likely that it 's I who am at the beck and call of the woman , than she at mine . '
122721	122725	122726	122726	he	1603	' I know , '
122729	122789	122726	122726	he	1603	' she 'll please herself - she always has done . I 've done my best for them , but that does n't matter . They 've got themselves to please , and if they can help it they 'll please nobody BUT themselves . But she 's a right to consider her mother , and me as well - '
122797	122834	122881	122881	Brangwen	304	' And I tell you this much , I would rather bury them , than see them getting into a lot of loose ways such as you see everywhere nowadays . I 'd rather bury them - '
122835	122842	122844	122844	Birkin	179	' Yes but , you see , '
122857	122874	122844	122844	Birkin	179	' they wo n't give either you or me the chance to bury them , because they 're
122880	122880	122844	122844	Birkin	179	'
122893	122899	122900	122900	he	3249	' Now , Mr Birkin , '
122903	122922	122900	122900	he	3249	' I do n't know what you 've come here for , and I do n't know what you 're
122946	122946	122947	122947	Birkin	179	'
122972	122981	122982	122982	Brangwen	304	' I 've nothing against your marrying Ursula , '
122987	123009	122982	122982	Brangwen	304	' It 's got nothing to do with me , she 'll do as she likes , me or no me . '
123328	123338	123340	123340	Rosalind	346	' Did you bring me that Girl 's Own ? '
123342	123359	123381	123381	her	3253	' Yes , I brought it . But I forgot which one it was you wanted . '
123360	123364	123366	123366	Rosalind	346	' You would , '
123369	123377	123366	123366	Rosalind	346	' It 's right for a wonder . '
123389	123392	123394	123394	Ursula	264	' Where ? '
123419	123422	123413	123413	his	304	' Ursula . '
123433	123440	123441	123441	she	3253	' Oh how do you do ! '
123501	123508	123509	123509	she	3253	' Have I interrupted a conversation ? '
123512	123520	123522	123522	Birkin	179	' No , only a complete silence , '
123524	123527	123529	123529	Ursula	264	' Oh , '
123567	123580	123582	123583	her father	601	' Mr Birkin came to speak to YOU , not to me , '
123585	123591	123592	123592	she	3253	' Oh , did he ! '
123624	123630	123609	123609	she	3253	' Was it anything special ? '
123631	123636	123637	123637	he	601	' I hope so , '
123642	123654	123656	123657	her father	601	' - To propose to you , according to all accounts , '
123659	123662	123664	123664	Ursula	264	' Oh , '
123666	123669	123671	123672	her father	601	' Oh , '
123677	123685	123671	123672	her father	601	' Have you nothing more to say ? '
123692	123702	123703	123703	she	3253	' Did you really come to propose to me ? '
123715	123718	123719	123719	he	601	' Yes , '
123722	123730	123719	123719	he	601	' I suppose I came to propose . '
123741	123745	123746	123746	she	3253	' Did you ? '
123766	123769	123770	123770	he	601	' Yes , '
123773	123787	123770	123770	he	601	' I wanted to - I wanted you to agree to marry me . '
123875	123878	123879	123879	she	3253	' Yes , '
123965	123973	123974	123974	he	601	' Well , what do you say ? '
123996	124005	124008	124008	she	3253	' I did n't speak , did I ? '
124017	124020	124022	124023	her father	601	' No , '
124027	124047	124022	124023	her father	601	' But you need n't look like an idiot . You 've got your wits , have n't you ? '
124055	124067	124068	124068	she	3253	' I 've got my wits , what does that mean ? '
124078	124090	124092	124093	her father	601	' You heard what was asked you , did n't you ? '
124097	124103	124092	124092	her	3253	' Of course I heard . '
124104	124113	124115	124116	her father	601	' Well then , ca n't you answer ? '
124118	124123	124131	124131	he	601	' Why should I ? '
124140	124143	124145	124145	Birkin	179	' No , '
124153	124170	124145	124145	Birkin	179	' there 's no need to answer at once . You can say when you like . '
124179	124186	124187	124187	she	3253	' Why should I say anything ? '
124190	124216	124187	124187	she	3253	' You do this off your OWN bat , it has nothing to do with me . Why do you both want to bully me ? '
124217	124224	124226	124227	her father	601	' Bully you ! Bully you ! '
124235	124270	124226	124227	her father	601	' Bully you ! Why , it 's a pity you ca n't be bullied into some sense and decency . Bully you ! YOU'LL see to that , you self - willed creature . '
124305	124312	124313	124313	he	601	' But none is bullying you , '
124324	124328	124329	124329	she	3253	' Oh yes , '
124332	124342	124329	124329	she	3253	' You both want to force me into something . '
124343	124351	124352	124352	he	601	' That is an illusion of yours , '
124356	124359	124361	124362	her father	601	' Illusion ! '
124364	124377	124361	124362	her father	601	' A self - opinionated fool , that 's what she is . '
124383	124395	124378	124378	Birkin	179	' However , we 'll leave it for the time being . '
124408	124415	124416	124417	her father	601	' You fool ! You fool ! '
125086	125090	125091	125091	she	3291	' Of course , '
125095	125192	125091	125091	she	3291	' there is a quality of life in Birkin which is quite remarkable . There is an extraordinary rich spring of life in him , really amazing , the way he can give himself to things . But there are so many things in life that he simply does n't know . Either he is not aware of their existence at all , or he dismisses them as merely negligible - things which are vital to the other person . In a way , he is not clever enough , he is too intense in spots . '
125193	125196	125198	125198	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
125200	125213	125198	125198	Ursula	264	' too much of a preacher . He is really a priest . '
125214	125241	125091	125091	she	3291	' Exactly ! He ca n't hear what anybody else has to say - he simply can not hear . His own voice is so loud . '
125242	125250	125198	125198	Ursula	264	' Yes . He cries you down . '
125251	125257	125259	125259	Gudrun	352	' He cries you down , '
125261	125302	125259	125259	Gudrun	352	' And by mere force of violence . And of course it is hopeless . Nobody is convinced by violence . It makes talking to him impossible - and living with him I should think would be more than impossible . '
125303	125313	125315	125315	Ursula	264	' You do n't think one could live with him '
125317	125394	125259	125259	Gudrun	352	' I think it would be too wearing , too exhausting . One would be shouted down every time , and rushed into his way without any choice . He would want to control you entirely . He can not allow that there is any other mind than his own . And then the real clumsiness of his mind is its lack of self - criticism . No , I think it would be perfectly intolerable . '
125395	125398	125400	125400	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
125410	125415	125416	125416	she	3297	' The nuisance is , '
125419	125432	125416	125416	she	3297	' that one would find almost any man intolerable after a fortnight . '
125433	125439	125441	125441	Gudrun	352	' It 's perfectly dreadful , '
125443	125472	125441	125441	Gudrun	352	' But Birkin - he is too positive . He could n't bear it if you called your soul your own . Of him that is strictly true . '
125473	125476	125478	125478	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
125480	125487	125478	125478	Ursula	264	' You must have HIS soul . '
125488	125499	125441	125441	Gudrun	352	' Exactly ! And what can you conceive more deadly ? '
125703	125710	125712	125712	Gudrun	352	' Does n't he feel important ? '
125714	125719	125721	125721	Ursula	264	' Does n't he ! '

125742	125761	125763	125763	Gudrun	352	' Is n't he ! Little Lloyd George of the air ! That 's just what they are , '
125854	125959	125849	125849	she	352	' After all , it is impudence to call them little Lloyd Georges . They are really unknown to us , they are the unknown forces . It is impudence to look at them as if they were the same as human beings . They are of another world . How stupid anthropomorphism is ! Gudrun is really impudent , insolent , making herself the measure of everything , making everything come down to human standards . Rupert is quite right , human beings are boring , painting the universe with their own image . The universe is non - human , thank God . '

126795	126825	126792	126792	he	3308	' I 'd just come to the conclusion that nothing in the world mattered except somebody to take the edge off one 's being alone : the right somebody . '
126859	126869	126871	126871	Birkin	179	' The right woman , I suppose you mean , '
126874	126888	126892	126892	he	3308	' Of course , for choice . Failing that , an amusing man . '
126903	126909	126910	126910	he	3308	' What were you doing ? '
126913	126919	126892	126892	he	3308	' I ? Nothing . I 'm
126954	126957	126996	126996	Birkin	179	'm sure . '
126958	126965	126953	126953	I	0	' You mean you are bored ? '
126966	126995	126996	126996	Birkin	179	' Bored , I do n't know . I ca n't apply myself . And I feel the devil is either very present inside me , or dead . '
127005	127012	127013	127013	he	3308	' You should try hitting something , '
127019	127022	127023	127023	he	264	' Perhaps , '
127026	127036	127023	127023	he	264	' So long as it was something worth hitting . '
127037	127040	127042	127042	Birkin	179	' Quite ! '
127065	127071	127073	127073	Birkin	179	' One has to wait , '
127075	127087	127045	127045	his	3308	' Ah God ! Waiting ! What are we waiting for ? '
127088	127107	127109	127109	Birkin	179	' Some old Johnny says there are three cures for ENNUI , sleep , drink , and travel , '
127111	127116	127118	127118	Gerald	264	' All cold eggs , '
127120	127152	127045	127045	his	3308	' In sleep , you dream , in drink you curse , and in travel you yell at a porter . No , work and love are the two . When you 're

127163	127168	127170	127170	Birkin	179	' Be it then , '
127172	127178	127180	127180	Gerald	264	' Give me the object , '
127182	127190	127180	127180	Gerald	264	' The possibilities of love exhaust themselves . '
127191	127199	127045	127045	his	3308	' Do they ? And then what ? '
127200	127205	127207	127207	Gerald	264	' Then you die , '
127209	127214	127216	127216	Birkin	179	' So you ought , '
127218	127225	127227	127227	Gerald	264	' I do n't see it , '
127282	127293	127295	127295	Birkin	179	' There 's a third one even to your two , '

127331	127341	127343	127343	Birkin	179	' No , I do n't think I did , '
127345	127348	127349	127349	Gerald	264	' Ay - '
127362	127365	127367	127367	Birkin	179	' Why ? '
127369	127397	127319	127319	Gerald	264	' Nothing . I thought we might have a round . It is perhaps true , that I want something to hit . It 's a suggestion . '
127398	127409	127411	127411	Birkin	179	' So you think you might as well hit me ? '
127413	127431	127319	127319	Gerald	264	' You ? Well ! Perhaps - ! In a friendly kind of way , of course . '
127432	127435	127437	127437	Birkin	179	' Quite ! '
127487	127506	127507	127507	he	264	' I fell that if I do n't watch myself , I shall find myself doing something silly , '
127510	127516	127518	127518	Birkin	179	' Why not do it ? '
127544	127553	127555	127555	Birkin	179	' I used to do some Japanese wrestling , '
127557	127586	127555	127555	Birkin	179	' A Jap lived in the same house with me in Heidelberg , and he taught me a little . But I was never much good at it . '
127587	127591	127593	127593	Gerald	264	' You did ! '
127595	127618	127593	127593	Gerald	264	' That 's one of the things I 've never ever seen done . You mean jiu - jitsu , I suppose ? '
127619	127637	127689	127689	he	264	' Yes . But I am no good at those things - they do n't interest me . '
127638	127652	127593	127593	Gerald	264	' They do n't ? They do me . What 's the start ? '
127653	127666	127668	127668	Birkin	179	' I 'll show you what I can , if you like , '
127670	127674	127689	127689	he	264	' You will ? '
127692	127702	127689	127689	he	264	' Well , I 'd like it very much . '
127703	127723	127689	127689	he	264	' Then we 'll try jiu - jitsu . Only you ca n't do much in a starched shirt . '
127724	127739	127740	127740	He	264	' Then let us strip , and do it properly . Hold a minute - '
127751	127761	127762	127762	he	264	' Bring a couple of sandwiches and a syphon , '
127768	127784	127762	127762	he	264	' and then do n't trouble me any more tonight - or let anybody else . '
127798	127808	127809	127809	he	264	' And you used to wrestle with a Jap ? '
127812	127817	127809	127809	he	264	' Did you strip ? '
127818	127821	127789	127789	Gerald	264	' Sometimes . '
127822	127836	127809	127809	he	264	' You did ! What was he like then , as a wrestler ? '
127837	127892	127789	127789	Gerald	264	' Good , I believe . I am no judge . He was very quick and slippery and full of electric fire . It is a remarkable thing , what a curious sort of fluid force they seem to have in them , those people not like a human grip - like a polyp - '
127896	127902	127903	127903	he	264	' I should imagine so , '
127906	127918	127903	127903	he	264	' to look at them . They repel me , rather . '
127919	127965	127809	127809	he	264	' Repel and attract , both . They are very repulsive when they are cold , and they look grey . But when they are hot and roused , there is a definite attraction - a curious kind of full electric fluid - like eels . '
127966	127973	127903	127903	he	264	' Well - yes - probably . '
127985	127993	127995	127995	Gerald	264	' Do n't come in any more , '
128001	128005	128007	128007	Gerald	264	' Well then , '
128009	128023	128007	128007	Gerald	264	' shall we strip and begin ? Will you have a drink first ? '
128024	128033	128039	128039	Gerald	264	' No , I do n't want one . '
128034	128038	128007	128007	Gerald	264	' Neither do I. '
128127	128130	128132	128132	Birkin	179	' Now , '
128134	128155	128132	128132	Birkin	179	' I will show you what I learned , and what I remember . You let me take you so - '
128199	128204	128205	128205	he	264	' That 's smart , '
128208	128213	128205	128205	he	264	' Now try again . '
129158	129162	129164	129164	Gerald	264	' Of course - '
129166	129187	129164	129164	Gerald	264	' I did n't have to be rough - with you - I had to keep back - my force - '
129267	129277	129279	129279	Gerald	264	' I could have thrown you - using violence - '
129281	129289	129279	129279	Gerald	264	' But you beat me right enough . '
129290	129293	129295	129295	Birkin	179	' Yes , '
129309	129311	129295	129295	Birkin	179	' you 're
129324	129324	129317	129317	you	0	'
129340	129345	129347	129347	Gerald	264	' It surprised me , '
129349	129359	129347	129347	Gerald	264	' what strength you 've got . Almost supernatural . '
129360	129365	129367	129367	Birkin	179	' For a moment , '
129600	129613	129615	129615	Birkin	179	' It was a real set - to , was n't it ? '
129624	129629	129631	129631	Gerald	264	' God , yes , '
129647	129659	129633	129633	He	264	' It was n't too much for you , was it ? '
129660	129679	129633	129633	He	264	' No . One ought to wrestle and strive and be physically close . It makes one sane . '
129680	129686	129633	129633	He	264	' You do think so ? '
129687	129695	129633	129633	He	264	' I do . Do n't you ? '
129696	129699	129701	129701	Gerald	264	' Yes , '
129726	129750	129633	129633	He	264	' We are mentally , spiritually intimate , therefore we should be more or less physically intimate too - it is more whole . '
129751	129756	129758	129758	Gerald	264	' Certainly it is , '
129767	129775	129761	129761	he	264	' It 's rather wonderful to me . '
129783	129786	129788	129788	Birkin	179	' Yes , '
129790	129803	129788	129788	Birkin	179	' I do n't know why one should have to justify oneself . '
129804	129807	129761	129761	he	264	' No . '
129815	129824	129826	129826	Birkin	179	' I think also that you are beautiful , '
129830	129844	129826	129826	Birkin	179	' and that is enjoyable too . One should enjoy what is given . '
129845	129859	129861	129861	Gerald	264	' You think I am beautiful - how do you mean , physically ? '
129867	129906	129826	129826	Birkin	179	' Yes . You have a northern kind of beauty , like light refracted from snow - and a beautiful , plastic form . Yes , that is there to enjoy as well . We should enjoy everything . '
129916	129950	129907	129907	Gerald	264	' That 's certainly one way of looking at it . I can say this much , I feel better . It has certainly helped me . Is this the Bruderschaft you wanted ? '
129951	129961	129907	129907	Gerald	264	' Perhaps . Do you think this pledges anything ? '
129962	129968	129970	129970	Gerald	264	' I do n't know , '
129972	129992	129970	129970	Gerald	264	' At any rate , one feels freer and more open now - and that is what we want . '
129993	129996	129998	129998	Gerald	264	' Certainly , '
130016	130028	130030	130030	Gerald	264	' I always eat a little before I go to bed , '
130032	130037	130030	130030	Gerald	264	' I sleep better . '
130038	130046	130048	130048	Birkin	179	' I should not sleep so well , '
130050	130071	130072	130072	Birkin	179	' No ? There you are , we are not alike . I 'll put a dressing - gown on . '
130120	130126	130128	130128	Birkin	179	' You are very fine , '
130136	130144	130146	130146	Gerald	264	' It was a caftan in Bokhara , '
130148	130153	130146	130146	Gerald	264	' I like it . '
130154	130160	130161	130161	Birkin	179	' I like it too . '
130218	130223	130225	130225	Gerald	264	' Of course you , '
130234	130243	130225	130225	Gerald	264	' there 's something curious about you . You 're
130258	130258	130259	130259	Birkin	179	'
130348	130353	130354	130354	he	264	' Do you know , '
130358	130374	130354	130354	he	264	' I went and proposed to Ursula Brangwen tonight , that she should marry me . '
130387	130391	130375	130375	He	3366	' You did ? '
130392	130421	130375	130375	He	3366	' Yes . Almost formally - speaking first to her father , as it should be , in the world - though that was accident - or mischief . '
130435	130456	130375	130375	He	3366	' You do n't mean to say that you seriously went and asked her father to let you marry her ? '
130457	130460	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' Yes , '
130464	130468	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' I did . '
130469	130483	130375	130375	He	3366	' What , had you spoken to her before about it , then ? '
130484	130518	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' No , not a word . I suddenly thought I would go there and ask her - and her father happened to come instead of her - so I asked him first . '
130519	130526	130528	130528	Gerald	264	' If you could have her ? '
130530	130537	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' Ye - es , that . '
130538	130547	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' And you did n't speak to her ? '
130548	130565	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' Yes . She came in afterwards . So it was put to her as well . '
130566	130578	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' It was ! And what did she say then ? You 're
130583	130583	130579	130581	an engaged man	3374	'
130584	130601	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' No , - she only said she did n't want to be bullied into answering . '
130602	130606	130579	130581	an engaged man	3374	' She what ? '
130607	130619	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' Said she did n't want to be bullied into answering . '
130620	130643	130579	130581	an engaged man	3374	' " Said she did n't want to be bullied into answering ! " Why , what did she mean by that ? '
130649	130654	130655	130655	he	264	' Ca n't say , '
130658	130671	130655	130655	he	264	' Did n't want to be bothered just then , I suppose . '
130672	130686	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' But is this really so ? And what did you do then ? '
130687	130698	130655	130655	he	264	' I walked out of the house and came here . '
130699	130705	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' You came straight here ? '
130706	130709	130655	130655	he	264	' Yes . '
130724	130737	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' But is this really true , as you say it now ? '
130738	130743	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' Word for word . '
130744	130748	130462	130462	Birkin	179	' It is ? '
130762	130769	130770	130770	he	264	' Well , that 's good , '
130773	130789	130770	130770	he	264	' And so you came here to wrestle with your good angel , did you ? '
130790	130794	130796	130796	Birkin	179	' Did I ? '
130798	130813	130770	130770	he	264	' Well , it looks like it . Is n't that what you did ? '
130823	130831	130833	130833	Gerald	264	' And what 's going to happen ? '
130835	130837	130770	130770	he	264	' You 're
130849	130849	130770	130770	he	264	'
130850	130882	130885	130885	him	264	' I suppose so . I vowed to myself I would see them all to the devil . But I suppose I shall ask her again , in a little while . '
130888	130891	130770	130770	he	264	' So you 're
130897	130900	130770	130770	he	264	' he asked .
130901	130909	130911	130911	Birkin	179	' I think - I love her , '
130955	130959	130960	130960	he	264	' You know , '
130963	130981	130960	130960	he	264	' I always believed in love - true love . But where does one find it nowadays ? '
130982	130988	130990	130990	Birkin	179	' I do n't know , '
130992	130996	130998	130998	Gerald	264	' Very rarely , '
131006	131073	131111	131111	He	264	' I 've never felt it myself - not what I should call love . I 've gone after women - and been keen enough over some of them . But I 've never felt LOVE . I do n't believe I 've ever felt as much LOVE for a woman , as I have for you - not LOVE . You understand what I mean ? '
131074	131078	131111	131111	He	264	' Yes . I 'm
131087	131087	131111	131111	He	264	'
131088	131110	131111	131111	He	264	' You feel that , do you ? And do you think I ever shall ? You understand what I mean ? '
131132	131151	131111	131111	He	264	' I mean that - that I ca n't express what it is , but I know it . '
131152	131159	131161	131161	Birkin	179	' What is it , then ? '
131163	131191	131192	131192	His	264	' You see , I ca n't put it into words . I mean , at any rate , something abiding , something that ca n't change - '
131199	131213	131214	131214	he	264	' Now do you think I shall ever feel that for a woman ? '
131229	131235	131236	131236	he	264	' I do n't know , '
131239	131245	131236	131236	he	264	' I could not say . '
131267	131270	131271	131271	he	264	' No , '
131274	131284	131271	131271	he	264	' and neither do I , and neither do I. '
131285	131294	131296	131296	Birkin	179	' We are different , you and I , '
131298	131306	131296	131296	Birkin	179	' I ca n't tell your life . '
131307	131310	131312	131312	Gerald	264	' No , '
131314	131330	131312	131312	Gerald	264	' no more can I. But I tell you - I begin to doubt it ! '
131331	131340	131296	131296	Birkin	179	' That you will ever love a woman ? '
131341	131353	131312	131312	Gerald	264	' Well - yes - what you would truly call love - '
131354	131359	131296	131296	Birkin	179	' You doubt it ? '
131360	131367	131312	131312	Gerald	264	' Well - I begin to . '
131374	131382	131384	131384	Birkin	179	' Life has all kinds of things , '
131386	131394	131384	131384	Birkin	179	' There is n't only one road . '
131395	131437	131438	131438	he	264	' Yes , I believe that too . I believe it . And mind you , I do n't care how it is with me - I do n't care how it is - so long as I do n't feel - '
131457	131485	131438	131438	he	264	' so long as I feel I 've LIVED , somehow - and I do n't care how it is - but I want to feel that - '
131486	131489	131491	131491	Birkin	179	' Fulfilled , '
131493	131513	131438	131438	he	264	' We - ell , perhaps it is fulfilled ; I do n't use the same words as you . '
131514	131520	131438	131438	he	264	' It is the same . '
131580	131796	131573	131574	Winifred Crich	194	' Father also has been to London , to be examined by the doctors . It made him very tired . They say he must rest a very great deal , so he is mostly in bed . He brought me a lovely tropical parrot in faience , of Dresden ware , also a man ploughing , and two mice climbing up a stalk , also in faience . The mice were Copenhagen ware . They are the best , but mice do n't shine so much , otherwise they are very good , their tails are slim and long . They all shine nearly like glass . Of course it is the glaze , but I do n't like it . Gerald likes the man ploughing the best , his trousers are torn , he is ploughing with an ox , being I suppose a German peasant . It is all grey and white , white shirt and grey trousers , but very shiny and clean . Mr Birkin likes the girl best , under the hawthorn blossom , with a lamb , and with daffodils painted on her skirts , in the drawing room . But that is silly , because the lamb is not a real lamb , and she is silly too .
131797	131896	132024	132024	Gudrun	352	' Dear Miss Brangwen , are you coming back soon , you are very much missed here . I enclose a drawing of father sitting up in bed . He says he hopes you are not going to forsake us . Oh dear Miss Brangwen , I am sure you wo n't . Do come back and draw the ferrets , they are the most lovely noble darlings in the world . We might carve them in holly - wood , playing against a background of green leaves . Oh do let us , for they are most beautiful .
131897	132023	132024	132024	Gudrun	352	' Father says we might have a studio . Gerald says we could easily have a beautiful one over the stables , it would only need windows to be put in the slant of the roof , which is a simple matter . Then you could stay here all day and work , and we could live in the studio , like two real artists , like the man in the picture in the hall , with the frying - pan and the walls all covered with drawings . I long to be free , to live the free life of an artist . Even Gerald told father that only an artist is free , because he lives in a creative world of his own - '
132193	132210	132211	132211	Gerald	264	' You should make a bunch of flowers to give to Miss Brangwen when she arrives , '
132218	132222	132224	132224	Winifred	194	' Oh no , '
132226	132231	132224	132224	Winifred	194	' it 's silly . '
132232	132246	132224	132224	Winifred	194	' Not at all . It is a very charming and ordinary attention . '
132247	132254	132256	132256	Winifred	194	' Oh , it is silly , '
132475	132478	132479	132479	she	194	' Daddie - '
132482	132488	132507	132508	Her father	601	' What , my precious ? '
132527	132540	132514	132514	his	601	' What do you want to say to me , my love ? '
132541	132545	132546	132546	her	194	' Daddie - ! '
132551	132567	132546	132546	her	194	' is n't it silly if I give Miss Brangwen some flowers when she comes ? '
132589	132607	132568	132570	The sick man	2581	' No , darling , that 's not silly . It 's what they do to queens . '
132636	132641	132642	132642	she	194	' Shall I then ? '
132645	132668	132620	132620	queens	6584	' Give Miss Brangwen some flowers ? Do , Birdie . Tell Wilson I say you are to have what you want . '
132688	132698	132699	132699	she	194	' But I wo n't get them till tomorrow , '
132702	132715	132669	132670	The child	2258	' Not till tomorrow , Birdie . Give me a kiss then - '
132771	132779	132780	132780	Wilson	348	' What do you want these for ? '
132783	132788	132789	132789	she	194	' I want them , '
132800	132828	132794	132794	servants	3402	' Ay , you 've said as much . But what do you want them for , for decoration , or to send away , or what ? '
132829	132838	132794	132794	servants	3402	' I want them for a presentation bouquet . '
132839	132855	132794	132794	servants	3402	' A presentation bouquet ! Who 's coming then ? - the Duchess of Portland ? '
132856	132859	132794	132794	servants	3402	' No . '
132860	132888	132794	132794	servants	3402	' Oh , not her ? Well you 'll have a rare poppy - show if you put all the things you 've mentioned into your bouquet . '
132889	132900	132794	132794	servants	3402	' Yes , I want a rare poppy - show . '
132901	132914	132794	132794	servants	3402	' You do ! Then there 's no more to be said . '
133161	133171	133172	133172	she	194	' We are so glad you 've come back , '
133175	133181	133182	133182	She	194	' These are your flowers . '
133187	133190	133192	133192	Gudrun	352	' Mine ! '
133319	133326	133327	133327	she	352	' But how beautiful they are ! '
133363	133376	133377	133377	he	180	' I was afraid you were going to run away from us , '
133396	133399	133400	133400	she	352	' Really ! '
133403	133415	133416	133416	Her	352	' No , I did n't want to stay in London . '
133439	133446	133448	133449	the father	659	' That is a good thing , '
133451	133462	133448	133449	the father	659	' You see you are very welcome here among us . '
133489	133503	133504	133505	Mr Crich	180	' And you look as if you came home in every possible triumph , '
133512	133515	133516	133516	she	352	' No , '
133522	133534	133516	133516	she	352	' I have n't had any triumph till I came here . '
133535	133543	133504	133505	Mr Crich	180	' Ah , come , come ! We 're
133564	133564	133562	133562	Gerald	264	'
133565	133572	133574	133574	Gerald	264	' You came off pretty well , '
133581	133587	133574	133574	Gerald	264	' Did you sell anything ? '
133588	133591	133592	133592	she	352	' No , '
133595	133599	133592	133592	she	352	' not much . '
133600	133605	133606	133606	he	264	' Just as well , '
133635	133638	133640	133641	the father	659	' Winifred , '
133643	133661	133640	133641	the father	659	' have you a pair of shoes for Miss Brangwen ? You had better change at once - '
133672	133679	133681	133682	the father	659	' Quite a remarkable young woman , '
133691	133694	133696	133696	Gerald	264	' Yes , '
133948	133956	133957	133957	he	180	' Ah , this is Miss Brangwen , '
133973	133987	133988	133988	He	180	' Thomas , put Miss Brangwen a chair here - that 's right . '
134007	134026	133988	133988	He	180	' Now , you will have a glass of sherry and a little piece of cake . Thomas - '
134027	134032	134034	134034	Gudrun	352	' No thank you , '
134090	134099	134100	134100	she	352	' I do n't like sherry very much , '
134103	134111	134100	134100	she	352	' But I like almost anything else . '
134121	134139	134082	134082	she	352	' Not sherry ! No ! Something else ! What then ? What is there , Thomas ? '
134140	134146	134191	134191	Gudrun	352	' Port wine - curacao - '
134147	134154	134156	134156	Gudrun	352	' I would love some curacao - '
134165	134184	134191	134191	Gudrun	352	' You would . Well then Thomas , curacao - and a little cake , or a biscuit ? '
134185	134189	134191	134191	Gudrun	352	' A biscuit , '
134204	134207	134208	134208	He	2581	' Yes . '
134227	134234	134235	134235	he	2581	' You have heard the plan , '
134241	134252	134235	134235	he	2581	' for a studio for Winifred , over the stables ? '
134253	134256	134258	134258	Gudrun	352	' No ! '
134264	134280	134308	134310	The sick man	2581	' Oh ! - I thought Winnie wrote it to you , in her letter ! '
134281	134301	134302	134302	Gudrun	352	' Oh - yes - of course . But I thought perhaps it was only her own little idea - '
134316	134352	134302	134302	Gudrun	352	' Oh no . It is a real project . There is a good room under the roof of the stables - with sloping rafters . We had thought of converting it into a studio . '
134353	134361	134363	134363	Gudrun	352	' How VERY nice that would be ! '
134377	134390	134302	134302	Gudrun	352	' You think it would ? Well , it can be done . '
134391	134434	134302	134302	Gudrun	352	' But how perfectly splendid for Winifred ! Of course , it is just what is needed , if she is to work at all seriously . One must have one 's workshop , otherwise one never ceases to be an amateur . '
134435	134455	134302	134302	Gudrun	352	' Is that so ? Yes . Of course , I should like you to share it with Winifred . '
134456	134462	134302	134302	Gudrun	352	' Thank you SO much . '
134483	134530	134531	134531	He	3427	' Of course , what I should like best , would be if you could give up your work at the Grammar School , and just avail yourself of the studio , and work there - well , as much or as little as you liked - '
134572	134608	134531	134531	He	3427	' And as to your earnings - you do n't mind taking from me what you have taken from the Education Committee , do you ? I do n't want you to be a loser . '
134609	134612	134614	134614	Gudrun	352	' Oh , '
134616	134637	134614	134614	Gudrun	352	' if I can have the studio and work there , I can earn money enough , really I can . '
134638	134641	134642	134642	he	3427	' Well , '
134651	134668	134642	134642	he	3427	' we can see about all that . You would n't mind spending your days here ? '
134669	134679	134681	134681	Gudrun	352	' If there were a studio to work in , '
134683	134691	134681	134681	Gudrun	352	' I could ask for nothing better . '
134692	134697	134642	134642	he	3427	' Is that so ? '
134758	134770	134753	134753	She	3430	' Perhaps you will sleep . I must look for Winifred . '
135203	135210	135211	135211	she	194	' Are you better , Daddie ? '
135221	135227	135218	135218	he	659	' Yes , I think I 'm
135234	135234	135218	135218	he	659	'
135867	135870	135871	135871	he	3434	' Well , '
135878	135888	135871	135871	he	3434	' and how are you and Winifred getting on ? '
135889	135896	135898	135898	Gudrun	352	' Oh , very well indeed , '
135931	135938	135939	135939	he	3434	' The studio answers all right ? '
135942	135954	135956	135956	Gudrun	352	' Splendid . It could n't be more beautiful and perfect , '
135967	135979	135958	135958	She	352	' And you think Winifred has the makings of a sculptor ? '
135991	135993	135958	135958	She	352	' I 'm
136006	136006	135998	135998	She	352	'
136007	136022	136050	136050	he	3434	' Ah ! Then her life wo n't be altogether wasted , you think ? '
136028	136034	136035	136035	she	352	' Sure it wo n't ! '
136039	136044	136050	136050	he	3434	' That 's right . '
136054	136070	136071	136071	he	3434	' You find life pleasant , it is good to live , is n't it ? '
136087	136090	136091	136091	she	352	' Yes , '
136100	136110	136094	136094	she	352	' I get a pretty good time I believe . '
136111	136124	136126	136126	Gudrun	352	' That 's right . A happy nature is a great asset . '
136247	136272	136208	136208	She	352	' You are quite all right here ? - nothing we can do for you ? - nothing you find wrong in your position ? '
136273	136283	136285	136285	Gudrun	352	' Except that you are too good to me , '
136287	136300	136301	136301	he	3434	' Ah , well , the fault of that lies with yourself , '
136451	136465	136441	136442	the child	2258	' Do you think my father 's going to die , Miss Brangwen ? '
136469	136475	136476	136476	she	2258	' I do n't know , '
136479	136485	136537	136537	she	2258	' Do n't you truly ? '
136486	136499	136537	136537	she	2258	' Nobody knows for certain . He MAY die , of course . '
136511	136520	136508	136508	she	2258	' But do you THINK he will die ? '
136556	136564	136566	136566	Gudrun	352	' Do I think he will die ? '
136568	136574	136566	136566	Gudrun	352	' Yes , I do . '
136592	136598	136600	136600	Gudrun	352	' He is very ill , '
136615	136623	136631	136631	she	2258	' I do n't believe he will , '
136668	136676	136677	136677	she	194	' I 've made a proper dam , '
136698	136712	136713	136713	he	264	' It is just as well she does n't choose to believe it , '
136732	136737	136739	136739	Gudrun	352	' Just as well , '
136756	136774	136775	136775	he	264	' Best to dance while Rome burns , since it must burn , do n't you think ? '
136793	136803	136790	136790	she	2258	' Oh - better dance than wail , certainly . '
136804	136809	136845	136845	Gudrun	352	' So I think . '
136993	137014	136985	136985	she	2258	' We might as well go down to the lodge after Winifred - we can get in the care there . '
137015	137020	137021	137021	he	3505	' So we can , '
137075	137078	137079	137079	she	559	' Look ! '
137082	137110	137111	137111	She	559	' Three new puppies ! Marshall says this one seems perfect . Is n't it a sweetling ? But it is n't so nice as its mother . '
137128	137134	137135	137135	she	559	' My dearest Lady Crich , '
137138	137193	137135	137135	she	559	' you are beautiful as an angel on earth . Angel - angel - do n't you think she 's good enough and beautiful enough to go to heaven , Gudrun ? They will be in heaven , wo n't they - and ESPECIALLY my darling Lady Crich ! Mrs Marshall , I say ! '
137194	137200	137202	137203	the woman	882	' Yes , Miss Winifred ? '
137210	137237	137202	137203	the woman	882	' Oh do call this one Lady Winifred , if she turns out perfect , will you ? Do tell Marshall to call it Lady Winifred . '

137342	137372	137373	137373	Birkin	179	' No I wo n't . I do want to sit in front next to you . It makes my feet so lovely and warm , from the engines . '
137393	137401	137402	137402	Gerald	264	' Have you any news , Rupert ? '
137412	137415	137417	137417	Birkin	179	' News ? '
137419	137422	137423	137423	Gerald	264	' Yes , '
137443	137466	137435	137435	he	264	' I want to know whether I ought to congratulate him , but I ca n't get anything definite out of him . '
137471	137477	137478	137478	she	352	' Congratulate him on what ? '
137481	137501	137438	137438	his	264	' There was some mention of an engagement - at least , he said something to me about it . '
137506	137512	137513	137513	she	352	' You mean with Ursula ? '
137519	137530	137578	137578	Birkin	179	' Yes . That is so , is n't it ? '
137531	137541	137543	137543	Gudrun	352	' I do n't think there 's any engagement , '
137547	137557	137558	137558	he	264	' That so ? Still no developments , Rupert ? '
137561	137568	137578	137578	Birkin	179	' Where ? Matrimonial ? No . '
137569	137574	137576	137576	Gudrun	352	' How 's that ? '
137591	137594	137595	137595	he	264	' Why ? '
137598	137608	137595	137595	he	264	' What do you think of it , Gudrun ? '
137609	137612	137613	137613	she	352	' Oh , '
137631	137652	137613	137613	she	352	' I do n't think she wants an engagement . Naturally , she 's a bird that prefers the bush . '
137676	137680	137682	137682	Birkin	179	' And I , '
137691	137709	137682	137682	Birkin	179	' I want a binding contract , and am not keen on love , particularly free love . '
137729	137738	137739	137739	he	264	' Love is n't good enough for you ? '
137742	137745	137747	137747	Birkin	179	' No ! '
137749	137760	137762	137762	Gerald	264	' Ha , well that 's being over - refined , '
137772	137780	137782	137782	Gerald	264	' What 's the matter , really ? '
137826	137831	137832	137832	she	352	' What is it ? '
137842	137864	137832	137832	she	352	' Do n't ask me ! - I know nothing about ULTIMATE marriage , I assure you : or even penultimate . '
137865	137872	137874	137874	Gerald	264	' Only the ordinary unwarrantable brand ! '
137876	137909	137874	137874	Gerald	264	' Just so - same here . I am no expert on marriage , and degrees of ultimateness . It seems to be a bee that buzzes loudly in Rupert 's bonnet . '
137910	137949	138012	138012	Gudrun	352	' Exactly ! But that is his trouble , exactly ! Instead of wanting a woman for herself , he wants his IDEAS fulfilled . Which , when it comes to actual practice , is not good enough . '
137950	137971	137973	137973	he	264	' Oh no . Best go slap for what 's womanly in woman , like a bull at a gate . '
137980	137991	137992	137992	he	264	' You think love is the ticket , do you ? '
137995	138010	138012	138012	Gudrun	352	' Certainly , while it lasts - you only ca n't insist on permanency , '
138021	138045	138012	138012	Gudrun	352	' Marriage or no marriage , ultimate or penultimate or just so - so ? - take the love as you find it . '
138046	138058	138059	138059	she	352	' As you please , or as you do n't please , '
138062	138084	138059	138059	she	352	' Marriage is a social arrangement , I take it , and has nothing to do with the question of love . '
138125	138136	138137	138137	Gerald	264	' You think Rupert is off his head a bit ? '
138146	138154	138155	138155	she	352	' As regards a woman , yes , '
138158	138212	138155	138155	she	352	' I do . There IS such a thing as two people being in love for the whole of their lives - perhaps . But marriage is neither here nor there , even then . If they are in love , well and good . If not - why break eggs about it ! '
138213	138216	138218	138218	Gerald	264	' Yes , '
138220	138233	138218	138218	Gerald	264	' That 's how it strikes me . But what about Rupert ? '
138234	138272	138155	138155	she	352	' I ca n't make out - neither can he nor anybody . He seems to think that if you marry you can get through marriage into a third heaven , or something - all very vague . '
138273	138305	138218	138218	Gerald	264	' Very ! And who wants a third heaven ? As a matter of fact , Rupert has a great yearning to be SAFE - to tie himself to the mast . '
138306	138319	138321	138321	Gudrun	352	' Yes . It seems to me he 's mistaken there too , '
138323	138325	138218	138218	Gerald	264	' I 'm
138409	138409	138421	138421	Gudrun	352	'
138410	138417	138419	138419	Gerald	264	' Into Paradise , he says , '
138426	138434	138435	138435	she	352	' FE M'EN FICHE of your Paradise ! '
138438	138444	138446	138446	Gerald	264	' Not being a Mohammedan , '
138482	138486	138487	138487	she	352	' He says , '
138496	138525	138487	138487	she	352	' that you can find an eternal equilibrium in marriage , if you accept the unison , and still leave yourself separate , do n't try to fuse . '
138526	138532	138534	138534	Gerald	264	' Does n't inspire me , '
138536	138542	138544	138544	Gudrun	352	' That 's just it , '
138546	138559	138487	138487	she	352	' I believe in love , in a real ABANDON , if you 're
138564	138567	138487	138487	she	352	' said Gerald .
138568	138573	138575	138575	she	352	' So do I , '
138577	138591	138487	138487	she	352	' And so does Rupert , too - though he is always shouting . '
138592	138595	138597	138597	Gudrun	352	' No , '
138599	138625	138597	138597	Gudrun	352	' He wo n't abandon himself to the other person . You ca n't be sure of him . That 's the trouble I think . '
138626	138637	138487	138487	she	352	' Yet he wants marriage ! Marriage - ET PUIS ? '
138638	138642	138644	138644	Gudrun	352	' Le paradis ! '
138798	138807	138808	138808	she	177	' It is a surprise to see you , '
138811	138814	138816	138816	Hermione	177	' Yes , '
138818	138826	138816	138816	Hermione	177	' I 've been away at Aix - '
138827	138834	138849	138849	Hermione	177	' Oh , for your health ? '
138835	138838	138816	138816	Hermione	177	' Yes . '
138878	138887	138888	138888	Ursula	264	' She 's got a horse - face , '
138893	138899	138888	138888	Ursula	264	' she runs between blinkers . '
139417	139426	139427	139427	she	177	' I am so glad to see you , '
139443	139452	139427	139427	she	177	' You and Rupert have become quite friends ? '
139453	139457	139459	139459	Ursula	264	' Oh yes , '
139461	139470	139459	139459	Ursula	264	' He is always somewhere in the background . '
139492	139496	139497	139497	she	177	' Is he ? '
139506	139515	139497	139497	she	177	' And do you think you will marry ? '
139557	139560	139562	139562	Ursula	264	' Well , '
139564	139573	139596	139596	she	177	' HE wants to , awfully , but I 'm
139578	139578	139562	139562	Ursula	264	'
139608	139615	139616	139616	she	177	' Why are n't you sure ? '
139640	139648	139625	139625	She	177	' You do n't really love him ? '
139693	139703	139704	139704	she	177	' He says it is n't love he wants , '
139707	139713	139714	139714	Hermione	177	' What is it then ? '
139720	139731	139714	139714	Hermione	177	' He wants me really to accept him in marriage . '
139747	139751	139752	139752	she	177	' Does he ? '
139764	139780	139752	139752	she	177	' And what is it you do n't want ? You do n't want marriage ? '
139781	139825	139732	139732	Hermione	177	' No - I do n't - not really . I do n't want to give the sort of SUBMISSION he insists on . He wants me to give myself up - and I simply do n't feel that I CAN do it . '
139837	139846	139834	139834	Hermione	177	' Not if you do n't want to . '
139882	139889	139877	139877	She	177	' You see I ca n't - '
139890	139897	139898	139898	They	3550	' But exactly in what does - '
139923	139933	139911	139911	Hermione	177	' To what does he want you to submit ? '
139934	139999	139877	139877	She	177	' He says he wants me to accept him non - emotionally , and finally - I really do n't know what he means . He says he wants the demon part of himself to be mated - physically - not the human being . You see he says one thing one day , and another the next - and he always contradicts himself - '
140000	140012	140014	140014	Hermione	177	' And always thinks about himself , and his own dissatisfaction , '
140017	140020	140022	140022	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
140024	140042	140022	140022	Ursula	264	' As if there were no - one but himself concerned . That makes it so impossible . '
140050	140062	140063	140063	she	177	' He insists on my accepting God knows what in HIM , '
140066	140131	140063	140063	she	177	' He wants me to accept HIM as - as an absolute - But it seems to me he does n't want to GIVE anything . He does n't want real warm intimacy - he wo n't have it - he rejects it . He wo n't let me think , really , and he wo n't let me FEEL - he hates feelings . '
140173	140181	140182	140182	Ursula	264	' He wants me to sink myself , '
140185	140195	140182	140182	Ursula	264	' not to have any being of my own - '
140196	140206	140208	140208	Hermione	177	' Then why does n't he marry an odalisk ? '
140216	140224	140208	140208	Hermione	177	' if it is that he wants . '
140233	140236	140238	140238	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
140463	140466	140468	140468	Hermione	177	' Yes , '
140481	140496	140468	140468	Hermione	177	' It would be a mistake - I think it would be a mistake - '
140497	140502	140504	140504	Ursula	264	' To marry him ? '
140506	140509	140511	140511	Hermione	177	' Yes , '
140514	140528	140511	140511	Hermione	177	' I think you need a man - soldierly , strong - willed - '
140541	140597	140532	140532	her	177	' You should have a man like the old heroes - you need to stand behind him as he goes into battle , you need to SEE his strength , and to HEAR his shout - . You need a man physically strong , and virile in his will , NOT a sensitive man - . '
140626	140795	140614	140615	the woman	882	' And you see , Rupert is n't this , he is n't . He is frail in health and body , he needs great , great care . Then he is so changeable and unsure of himself - it requires the greatest patience and understanding to help him . And I do n't think you are patient . You would have to be prepared to suffer - dreadfully . I ca n't TELL you how much suffering it would take to make him happy . He lives an INTENSELY spiritual life , at times - too , too wonderful . And then come the reactions . I ca n't speak of what I have been through with him . We have been together so long , I really do know him , I DO know what he is . And I feel I must say it ; I feel it would be perfectly DISASTROUS for you to marry him - for you even more than for him . '
140802	140895	140796	140796	Hermione	177	' He is so uncertain , so unstable - he wearies , and then reacts . I could n't TELL you what his re - actions are . I could n't TELL you the agony of them . That which he affirms and loves one day - a little latter he turns on it in a fury of destruction . He is never constant , always this awful , dreadful reaction . Always the quick change from good to bad , bad to good . And nothing is so devastating , nothing - '
140896	140899	140901	140901	Ursula	264	' Yes , '
140904	140910	140901	140901	Ursula	264	' you must have suffered . '
140928	140965	140920	140920	She	177	' And one must be willing to suffer - willing to suffer for him hourly , daily - if you are going to help him , if he is to keep true to anything at all - '
140966	140978	140980	140980	Ursula	264	' And I do n't WANT to suffer hourly and daily , '
140982	141002	140980	140980	Ursula	264	' I do n't , I should be ashamed . I think it is degrading not to be happy . '
141013	141017	141018	141018	she	177	' Do you ? '
141061	141064	141065	141065	she	177	' Yes , '
141068	141074	141065	141065	she	177	' One SHOULD be happy - '
141083	141086	141088	141088	Hermione	177	' Yes , '
141093	141165	141088	141088	Hermione	177	' I can only feel that it would be disastrous , disastrous - at least , to marry in a hurry . Ca n't you be together without marriage ? Ca n't you go away and live somewhere without marriage ? I do feel that marriage would be fatal , for both of you . I think for you even more than for him - and I think of his health - '
141166	141170	141172	141172	Ursula	264	' Of course , '
141174	141197	141172	141172	Ursula	264	' I do n't care about marriage - it is n't really important to me - it 's he who wants it . '
141198	141207	141209	141209	Hermione	177	' It is his idea for the moment , '
141237	141241	141088	141088	Hermione	177	' You think I 'm
141251	141251	141249	141249	you	177	'
141252	141256	141258	141258	Hermione	177	' No indeed , '
141260	141325	141258	141258	Hermione	177	' No , indeed ! But I think you are vital and young - it is n't a question of years , or even of experience - it is almost a question of race . Rupert is race - old , he comes of an old race - and you seem to me so young , you come of a young , inexperienced race . '
141326	141330	141332	141332	Ursula	264	' Do I ! '
141334	141347	141332	141332	Ursula	264	' But I think he is awfully young , on one side . '
141348	141359	141360	141360	They	3568	' Yes , perhaps childish in many respects . Nevertheless - '
141378	141384	141385	141385	she	3569	' It is n't true , '
141395	141584	141385	141385	she	3569	' It is n't true . And it is YOU who want a physically strong , bullying man , not I. It is you who want an unsensitive man , not I. You DON'T know anything about Rupert , not really , in spite of the years you have had with him . You do n't give him a woman 's love , you give him an ideal love , and that is why he reacts away from you . You do n't know . You only know the dead things . Any kitchen maid would know something about him , you do n't know . What do you think your knowledge is but dead understanding , that does n't mean a thing . You are so false , and untrue , how could you know anything ? What is the good of your talking about love - you untrue spectre of a woman ! How can you know anything , when you do n't believe ? You do n't believe in yourself and your own womanhood , so what good is your conceited , shallow cleverness - ! '
141869	141884	141857	141857	he	3576	' Hello , Hermione , are you back again ? How do you feel ? '
141885	141901	141949	141949	him	3576	' Oh , better . And how are you - you do n't look well - '
141902	141942	141857	141857	he	3576	' Oh ! - I believe Gudrun and Winnie Crich are coming in to tea . At least they said they were . We shall be a tea - party . What train did you come by , Ursula ? '
142042	142054	142056	142056	Hermione	177	' I think I shall go to Florence for the winter , '
142060	142064	142065	142065	he	3576	' Will you ? '
142068	142076	142065	142065	he	3576	' But it is so cold there . '
142077	142092	142113	142113	she	177	' Yes , but I shall stay with Palestra . It is quite comfortable . '
142093	142100	142065	142065	he	3576	' What takes you to Florence ? '
142101	142107	142109	142109	Hermione	177	' I do n't know , '
142124	142148	142113	142113	she	177	' Barnes is starting his school of aesthetics , and Olandese is going to give a set of discourses on the Italian national policy- '

142157	142166	142168	142168	Hermione	177	' No , I do n't think so , '
142170	142178	142113	142113	she	177	' Which do you admire , then ? '
142179	142204	142113	142113	she	177	' I admire both . Barnes is a pioneer . And then I am interested in Italy , in her coming to national consciousness . '
142205	142220	142222	142222	Birkin	179	' I wish she 'd come to something different from national consciousness , then , '
142224	142254	142222	142222	Birkin	179	' especially as it only means a sort of commercial - industrial consciousness . I hate Italy and her national rant . And I think Barnes is an amateur . '
142308	142311	142312	142312	she	177	' No , '
142315	142320	142312	142312	she	177	' you are wrong . '
142349	142374	142330	142330	she	177	' Il Sandro mi scrive che ha accolto il piu grande entusiasmo , tutti i giovani , e fanciulle e ragazzi , sono tutti - '
142410	142437	142407	142407	he	3585	' For all that , I do n't like it . Their nationalism is just industrialism - that and a shallow jealousy I detest so much . '
142438	142451	142453	142453	Hermione	177	' I think you are wrong - I think you are wrong - '
142455	142482	142453	142453	Hermione	177	' It seems to me purely spontaneous and beautiful , the modern Italian 's PASSION , for it is a passion , for Italy , L'Italia - '

142512	142537	142508	142508	she	177	' Yes , pretty well . I spent several years of my girlhood there , with my mother . My mother died in Florence . '
142538	142541	142554	142554	Hermione	177	' Oh . '
142631	142636	142638	142638	Hermione	177	' Micio ! Micio ! '

144405	144412	144375	144375	she	177	' You bought them for yourself ? '
144413	144423	144462	144462	He	3616	' No . Rings look wrong on my hands . '

144433	144442	144462	144462	He	3616	' I bought them to give to you . '
144443	144461	144375	144375	she	177	' But why ? Surely you ought to give them to Hermione ! You belong to her . '

144789	144812	144749	144749	He	3616	' No . I prefer unlucky things . Luck is vulgar . Who wants what LUCK would bring ? I do n't . '
144813	144817	144818	144818	she	177	' But why ? '

145415	145425	145426	145426	he	3639	' I promised to be at Shortlands for dinner , '

145622	145681	145619	145619	he	3639	' with your " go where you belong . " It 's finished between Hermione and me . She means much more to YOU , if it comes to that , than she does to me . For you can only revolt in pure reaction from her - and to be her opposite is to be her counterpart . '

145691	145741	145689	145689	Ursula	264	' I know your dodges . I am not taken in by your word - twisting . You belong to Hermione and her dead show . Well , if you do , you do . I do n't blame you . But then you 've nothing to do with me .

145884	145901	145908	145908	Hermione	177	' I jealous ! I - jealous ! You ARE mistaken if you think that . I 'm

You may well say , you do n't want love . No , you want YOURSELF , and dirt , and death - that 's what you want . You are so PERVERSE , so death - eating . And then - '

155913	156016	156017	156017	He	3838	're done . The whole of everything , and yourself included , is just on the point of caving in , and you are just holding it up with your hands . Well , it 's a situation that obviously ca n't continue . You ca n't stand holding the roof up with your hands , for ever . You know that sooner or later you 'll HAVE to let go . Do you understand what I mean ? And so something 's got to be done , or there 's a universal collapse - as far as you yourself are concerned . '

156146	156220	156140	156140	he	3838	' because there 's nothing to be DONE . I only want sympathy , do you see : I want somebody I can talk to sympathetically . That eases the strain . And there IS nobody to talk to sympathetically . That 's the curious thing . There IS nobody . There 's Rupert Birkin . But then he ISN'T sympathetic , he wants to DICTATE . And that is no use whatsoever . '

168646	168652	168654	168654	Birkin	376	' Do by all means , '
168656	168667	168654	168654	Birkin	376	' I did n't know you 'd got that length . '
168668	168672	168674	168674	Gerald	264	' What length ? '
168685	168696	168605	168605	Birkin	376	' Oh yes , we 've gone all the lengths . '
168697	168717	168719	168719	Birkin	376	' There remains to put it on a broad social basis , and to achieve a high moral purpose , '
168721	168735	168737	168737	Gerald	264	' Something like that : the length and breadth and height of it , '
168741	168745	168747	168747	Birkin	376	' Oh well , '
168749	168763	168747	168747	Birkin	376	' it 's a very admirable step to take , I should say . '
168770	168777	168778	168778	he	264	' Why are n't you enthusiastic ? '
168781	168792	168778	168778	he	264	' I thought you were such dead nuts on marriage . '
168798	168819	168793	168793	Birkin	376	' One might as well be dead nuts on noses . There are all sorts of noses , snub and otherwise- '
168823	168835	168836	168836	he	264	' And all sorts of marriage , also snub and otherwise ? '
168839	168844	168820	168820	Gerald	264	' That 's it . '
168845	168858	168860	168860	Gerald	264	' And you think if I marry , it will be snub ? '
168875	168885	168886	168886	he	264	' How do I know what it will be ! '
168889	168898	168886	168886	he	264	' Do n't lambaste me with my own parallels- '
168904	168916	168917	168917	he	264	' But I should like to know your opinion , exactly , '
168920	168943	168965	168965	Gerald	264	' On your marriage ? - or marrying ? Why should you want my opinion ? I 've got no opinions . I 'm
168963	168963	168967	168967	him	264	'
168970	168978	168979	168979	he	264	' More than that , I think , '
168983	169012	168979	168979	he	264	' However you may be bored by the ethics of marriage , yet really to marry , in one 's own personal case , is something critical , final- '
169013	169029	168965	168965	Gerald	264	' You mean there is something final in going to the registrar with a woman ? '
169030	169033	168979	168979	he	264	' If you 're
169042	169046	169039	169039	I	0	' said Gerald . '
169054	169054	169121	169121	Birkin	376	'
169055	169061	169063	169063	Birkin	376	' Yes , I agree , '
169065	169091	169121	169121	Birkin	376	' No matter how one regards legal marriage , yet to enter into the married state , in one 's own personal instance , is final- '
169092	169098	169100	169100	Birkin	376	' I believe it is , '
169102	169105	169100	169100	Birkin	376	' somewhere . '
169106	169117	169119	169119	Gerald	264	' The question remains then , should one do it , '
169130	169139	169140	169140	he	264	' You are like Lord Bacon , Gerald , '
169143	169184	169121	169121	Birkin	376	' You argue it like a lawyer - or like Hamlet 's to - be - or - not - to - be . If I were you I would NOT marry : but ask Gudrun , not me . You 're
169192	169192	169190	169190	you	264	'
169204	169207	169208	169208	he	264	' Yes , '
169211	169245	169208	169208	he	264	' one must consider it coldly . It is something critical . One comes to the point where one must take a step in one direction or another . And marriage is one direction- '
169246	169253	169255	169255	Birkin	376	' And what is the other ? '
169279	169285	169286	169286	he	264	' I ca n't say , '
169289	169295	169286	169286	he	264	' If I knew THAT - '
169308	169317	169319	169319	Birkin	376	' You mean if you knew the alternative ? '
169321	169336	169319	169319	Birkin	376	' And since you do n't know it , marriage is a PIS ALLER . '
169350	169363	169364	169364	he	264	' One does have the feeling that marriage is a PIS ALLER , '
169367	169374	169376	169376	Birkin	376	' Then do n't do it , '
169378	169383	169384	169384	he	264	' I tell you , '
169388	169462	169384	169384	he	264	' the same as I 've said before , marriage in the old sense seems to me repulsive . EGOISME A DEUX is nothing to it . It 's a sort of tacit hunting in couples : the world all in couples , each couple in its own little house , watching its own little interests , and stewing in its own little privacy - it 's the most repulsive thing on earth . '
169463	169468	169470	169470	Gerald	264	' I quite agree , '
169472	169490	169470	169470	Gerald	264	' There 's something inferior about it . But as I say , what 's the alternative . '
169491	169519	169384	169384	he	264	' One should avoid this HOME instinct . It 's not an instinct , it 's a habit of cowardliness . One should never have a HOME . '
169520	169525	169527	169527	Gerald	264	' I agree really , '
169529	169536	169527	169527	Gerald	264	' But there 's no alternative . '
169537	169588	169384	169384	he	264	' We 've got to find one . I do believe in a permanent union between a man and a woman . Chopping about is merely an exhaustive process . But a permanent relation between a man and a woman is n't the last word - it certainly is n't . '
169589	169592	169594	169594	Gerald	264	' Quite , '
169596	169600	169602	169602	Birkin	376	' In fact , '
169604	169633	169602	169602	Birkin	376	' because the relation between man and woman is made the supreme and exclusive relationship , that 's where all the tightness and meanness and insufficiency comes in . '
169634	169641	169643	169643	Gerald	264	' Yes , I believe you , '
169645	169684	169384	169384	he	264	' You 've got to take down the love - and - marriage ideal from its pedestal . We want something broader . I believe in the ADDITIONAL perfect relationship between man and man - additional to marriage . '
169685	169697	169699	169699	Gerald	264	' I can never see how they can be the same , '
169701	169720	169384	169384	he	264	' Not the same - but equally important , equally creative , equally sacred , if you like . '
169721	169725	169727	169727	Gerald	264	' I know , '
169729	169746	169727	169727	Gerald	264	' you believe something like that . Only I ca n't FEEL it , you see . '
170528	170531	170533	170533	Birkin	376	' Look , '
170535	170542	170533	170533	Birkin	376	' there is a pretty chair . '
170543	170546	170548	170548	Ursula	376	' Charming ! '
170550	170555	170548	170548	Ursula	376	' Oh , charming . '
170621	170626	170628	170628	Birkin	376	' It was once , '
170630	170728	170628	170628	Birkin	376	' gilded - and it had a cane seat . Somebody has nailed this wooden seat in . Look , here is a trifle of the red that underlay the gilt . The rest is all black , except where the wood is worn pure and glossy . It is the fine unity of the lines that is so attractive . Look , how they run and meet and counteract . But of course the wooden seat is wrong - it destroys the perfect lightness and unity in tension the cane gave . I like it though - '
170729	170733	170735	170735	Ursula	376	' Ah yes , '
170737	170741	170735	170735	Ursula	376	' so do I. '
170742	170748	170749	170749	Birkin	376	' How much is it ? '
170754	170758	170749	170749	Birkin	376	' Ten shillings . '
170759	170767	170749	170749	Birkin	376	' And you will send it - ? '
170772	170779	170780	170780	Birkin	376	' So beautiful , so pure ! '
170783	170790	170780	170780	Birkin	376	' It almost breaks my heart . '
170800	170817	170791	170791	They	4164	' My beloved country - it had something to express even when it made that chair . '
170818	170825	170827	170827	Ursula	376	' And has n't it now ? '
170839	170916	170834	170834	he	5376	' No , it has n't . When I see that clear , beautiful chair , and I think of England , even Jane Austen 's England - it had living thoughts to unfold even then , and pure happiness in unfolding them . And now , we can only fish among the rubbish heaps for the remnants of their old expression . There is no production in us now , only sordid and foul mechanicalness . '
170917	170923	170925	170925	Ursula	376	' It is n't true , '
170927	170966	170925	170925	Ursula	376	' Why must you always praise the past , at the expense of the present ? REALLY , I do n't think so much of Jane Austen 's England . It was materialistic enough , if you like - '
170967	170975	170977	170977	Birkin	376	' It could afford to be materialistic , '
170979	171031	170977	170977	Birkin	376	' because it had the power to be something other - which we have n't . We are materialistic because we have n't the power to be anything else - try as we may , we ca n't bring off anything but materialism : mechanism , the very soul of materialism . '
171054	171062	171044	171044	he	4165	' And I hate your past . I 'm
171067	171071	171044	171044	he	4165	' she cried . '
171118	171125	171117	171117	I	0	'm sick of the beloved past . '
171126	171138	171139	171139	he	4165	' Not so sick as I am of the accursed present , '
171142	171174	171184	171184	he	4165	' Yes , just the same . I hate the present - but I do n't want the past to take its place - I do n't want that old chair . '
171210	171214	171215	171215	he	4165	' All right , '
171218	171227	171215	171215	he	4165	' then let us not have it . I 'm

171269	171282	171283	171283	he	4165	' The truth is , we do n't want things at all , '
171286	171302	171283	171283	he	4165	' The thought of a house and furniture of my own is hateful to me . '
171314	171327	171311	171311	she	0	' So it is to me . But one must live somewhere . '

171338	171420	171335	171335	he	4165	' One should just live anywhere - not have a definite place . I do n't want a definite place . As soon as you get a room , and it is COMPLETE , you want to run from it . Now my rooms at the Mill are quite complete , I want them at the bottom of the sea . It is a horrible tyranny of a fixed milieu , where each piece of furniture is a commandment - stone . '
171434	171443	171444	171444	she	0	' But what are we going to do ? '
171447	171474	171444	171444	she	0	' We must live somehow . And I do want some beauty in my surroundings . I want a sort of natural GRANDEUR even , SPLENDOUR . '
171475	171629	171421	171421	She	0	' You 'll never get it in houses and furniture - or even clothes . Houses and furniture and clothes , they are all terms of an old base world , a detestable society of man . And if you have a Tudor house and old , beautiful furniture , it is only the past perpetuated on top of you , horrible . And if you have a perfect modern house done for you by Poiret , it is something else perpetuated on top of you . It is all horrible . It is all possessions , possessions , bullying you and turning you into a generalisation . You have to be like Rodin , Michelangelo , and leave a piece of raw rock unfinished to your figure . You must leave your surroundings sketchy , unfinished , so that you are never contained , never confined , never dominated from the outside . '

173507	173513	173515	173517	the young woman	4152	' Do n't spoil him , '
173519	173529	173515	173517	the young woman	4152	' He 's not used to arm - chairs , '
173547	173552	173534	173536	The young man	687	' Only warnts legs on '

173774	173790	173771	173771	he	687	' They remind me of Jesus : " The meek shall inherit the earth . " '
173791	173799	173801	173801	Ursula	376	' But they are n't the meek , '
173803	173816	173817	173817	he	687	' Yes , I do n't know why , but they are , '
173848	173858	173859	173859	she	376	' And are they going to inherit the earth ? '
173862	173867	173820	173820	They	4241	' Yes - they . '
173868	173877	173878	173878	she	376	' Then what are we going to do ? '

173892	173897	173820	173820	They	4241	're not the meek ? '
173898	173913	173891	173891	We	4241	' No . We 've got to live in the chinks they leave us . '
173914	173918	173920	173920	Ursula	376	' How horrible ! '
173922	173932	173920	173920	Ursula	376	' I do n't want to live in chinks . '
173933	173938	173939	173939	he	4246	' Do n't worry , '
173942	173967	173939	173939	he	4246	' They are the children of men , they like market - places and street - corners best . That leaves plenty of chinks . '
173968	173973	173974	173974	she	376	' All the world , '
173977	173985	173939	173939	he	4246	' Ah no - but some room . '
174049	174058	174060	174060	Ursula	376	' I do n't mind it even then , '
174070	174077	174060	174060	Ursula	376	' It does n't concern me . '

174092	174113	174085	174085	he	4246	' One need n't see . One goes one 's way . In my world it is sunny and spacious - '

174149	174162	174163	174163	he	4246	' And we will wander about on the face of the earth , '
174166	174179	174163	174163	he	4246	' and we 'll look at the world beyond just this bit . '
174198	174208	174209	174209	she	376	' I do n't want to inherit the earth , '
174212	174221	174209	174209	she	376	' I do n't want to inherit anything . '

174265	174278	174279	174279	she	376	' And we 'll be married , and have done with them , '
174286	174297	174298	174298	she	376	' It 's one way of getting rid of everything , '
174301	174306	174298	174298	she	376	' to get married . '
174307	174317	174318	174318	he	4246	' And one way of accepting the whole world , '
174321	174329	174330	174330	she	376	' A whole other world , yes , '
174334	174343	174344	174344	he	4246	' Perhaps there 's Gerald - and Gudrun - '
174347	174357	174358	174358	she	376	' If there is there is , you see , '
174361	174379	174358	174358	she	376	' It 's no good our worrying . We ca n't really alter them , can we ? '
174380	174383	174384	174384	he	4246	' No , '
174387	174404	174384	174384	he	4246	' One has no right to try - not with the best intentions in the world . '
174405	174413	174414	174414	she	376	' Do you try to force them ? '
174417	174420	174421	174421	he	4246	' Perhaps , '
174424	174441	174421	174421	he	4246	' Why should I want him to be free , if it is n't his business ? '
174448	174458	174459	174459	she	376	' We ca n't MAKE him happy , anyhow , '
174462	174472	174442	174442	She	376	' He 'd have to be it of himself . '
174473	174477	174478	174478	he	4246	' I know , '
174481	174494	174478	174478	he	4246	' But we want other people with us , do n't we ? '
174495	174500	174501	174501	she	376	' Why should we ? '
174504	174510	174511	174511	he	4246	' I do n't know , '
174515	174527	174511	174511	he	4246	' One has a hankering after a sort of further fellowship . '
174528	174532	174533	174533	she	376	' But why ? '
174536	174551	174533	174533	she	376	' Why should you hanker after other people ? Why should you need them ? '
174564	174574	174575	174575	he	4246	' Does it end with just our two selves ? '
174580	174607	174608	174608	His	4246	' Yes - what more do you want ? If anybody likes to come along , let them . But why must you run after them ? '
174615	174619	174620	174620	he	4246	' You see , '
174623	174643	174620	174620	he	4246	' I always imagine our being really happy with some few other people - a little freedom with people . '
174650	174703	174644	174644	She	4255	' Yes , one does want that . But it must HAPPEN . You ca n't do anything for it with your will . You always seem to think you can FORCE the flowers to come out . People must love us because they love us - you ca n't MAKE them . '
174704	174708	174709	174709	he	4246	' I know , '
174712	174742	174709	174709	he	4246	' But must one take no steps at all ? Must one just go as if one were alone in the world - the only creature in the world ? '
174743	174749	174750	174750	she	4255	' You 've got me , '
174753	174853	174750	174750	she	4255	' Why should you NEED others ? Why must you force people to agree with you ? Why ca n't you be single by yourself , as you are always saying ? You try to bully Gerald - as you tried to bully Hermione . You must learn to be alone . And it 's so horrid of you . You 've got me . And yet you want to force other people to love you as well . You do try to bully them to love you . And even then , you do n't want their love . '
174862	174867	174868	174868	he	4256	' Do n't I ? '
174871	174948	174868	174868	he	4256	' It 's the problem I ca n't solve . I KNOW I want a perfect and complete relationship with you : and we 've nearly got it - we really have . But beyond that . DO I want a real , ultimate relationship with Gerald ? Do I want a final , almost extra - human relationship with him - a relationship in the ultimate of me and him - or do n't I ? '

175128	175142	175121	175121	her	4257	' Everything is all right - we shall go to the registrar 's office- '
175159	175164	175166	175166	Gudrun	352	' REALLY , Ursula ! '
175168	175180	175182	175183	the mother	584	' Might we ask why there has been all this secrecy ? '
175188	175194	175196	175196	Ursula	264	' But there has n't , '
175198	175202	175196	175196	Ursula	264	' You knew . '

175301	175304	175306	175306	Gudrun	352	' Father ! '
175334	175346	175347	175347	she	4257	' But is n't it a FEARFULLY sudden decision , Ursula ? '
175350	175356	175358	175358	Ursula	264	' No , not really , '
175366	175407	175358	175358	Ursula	264	' He 's been WANTING me to agree for weeks - he 's had the licence ready . Only I - I was n't ready in myself . Now I am ready - is there anything to be disagreeable about ? '
175408	175412	175414	175414	Gudrun	352	' Certainly not , '
175424	175435	175414	175414	Gudrun	352	' You are perfectly free to do as you like . '
175436	175464	175465	175465	he	4272	' " Ready in yourself " - YOURSELF , that 's all that matters , is n't it ! " I was n't ready in myself , " '

176567	176584	176558	176558	She	352	' Because I said I was going to be married tomorrow , and he bullied me . '

176610	176633	176634	176634	she	352	' Because I said he did n't care - and he does n't , it 's only his domineeringness that 's hurt - '

176689	176700	176686	176686	he	4293	' And even so , you should n't SAY it . '
176701	176710	176711	176711	she	352	' It IS true - it IS true , '
176714	176747	176711	176711	she	352	' and I wo n't be bullied by his pretending it 's love - when it ISN'T - he does n't care , how can he - no , he ca n't - '
176759	176772	176774	176774	Birkin	179	' Then you should n't rouse him , if he ca n't , '

176811	176822	176823	176823	he	4293	' It 's been a love of opposition , then , '
176826	176841	176823	176823	he	4293	' Never mind - it will be all right . It 's nothing desperate . '
176842	176845	176846	176846	she	352	' Yes , '

176870	176894	176823	176823	he	4293	' Not immediately . Do n't cry , you had to break with him , it had to be - do n't cry . '

178327	178334	178326	178326	you	264	're the right man for her . '

178343	178354	178340	178340	he	264	' And do you think she would agree with you ? '
178355	178359	178360	178360	she	352	' Oh yes ! '
178372	178404	178405	178405	She	352	' Though Gudrun is n't so very simple , is she ? One does n't know her in five minutes , does one ? She 's not like me in that . '
178418	178428	178429	178429	Gerald	264	' You think she 's not much like you ? '
178437	178459	178432	178432	She	352	' Oh , in many ways she is . But I never know what she will do when anything new comes . '
178460	178465	178467	178467	Gerald	264	' You do n't ? '
178481	178501	178502	178502	he	264	' I was going to ask her , in any case , to go away with me at Christmas , '

178551	178555	178557	178557	Ursula	264	' Of course , '
178561	178576	178557	178557	Ursula	264	' she MIGHT just be willing to rush into marriage . You can see . '
178577	178580	178582	178582	Gerald	264	' Yes , '
178584	178615	178582	178582	Gerald	264	' I can see . But in case she wo n't - do you think she would go abroad with me for a few days - or for a fortnight ? '
178616	178620	178622	178622	Ursula	264	' Oh yes , '
178624	178630	178622	178622	Ursula	264	' I 'd ask her . '
178631	178641	178582	178582	Gerald	264	' Do you think we might all go together ? '

178655	178667	178649	178649	Ursula	264	' It would be rather fun , do n't you think ? '
178668	178672	178673	178673	he	264	' Great fun , '
178676	178683	178685	178685	Ursula	264	' And then you could see , '
178687	178690	178649	178649	Ursula	264	' What ? '
178691	178713	178649	178649	Ursula	264	' How things went . I think it is best to take the honeymoon before the wedding - do n't you ? '
178724	178729	178730	178730	he	264	' In certain cases , '
178733	178745	178730	178730	he	264	' I 'd rather it were so in my own case . '
178746	178750	178752	178752	Ursula	264	' Would you ! '
178757	178762	178752	178752	Ursula	264	' Yes , perhaps you 're

178787	178790	178792	178792	Birkin	179	' Gudrun ! '
178794	178831	178792	178792	Birkin	179	' She 's a born mistress , just as Gerald is a born lover - AMANT EN TITRE . If as somebody says all women are either wives or mistresses , then Gudrun is a mistress . '
178832	178841	178843	178843	Ursula	264	' And all men either lovers or husbands , '
178845	178851	178843	178843	Ursula	264	' But why not both ? '
178852	178859	178860	178860	he	264	' The one excludes the other , '
178863	178870	178872	178872	Ursula	264	' Then I want a lover , '
178874	178880	178881	178881	he	264	' No you do n't , '
178884	178889	178890	178890	she	4323	' But I do , '
179048	179060	179062	179062	Ursula	264	' I do n't believe I dare have come in alone , '
179064	179069	179062	179062	Ursula	264	' It frightens me . '
179070	179073	179075	179075	Gudrun	352	' Ursula ! '
179077	179112	179075	179075	Gudrun	352	' Is n't it amazing ! Can you believe you lived in this place and never felt it ? How I lived here a day without dying of terror , I can not conceive ! '
179265	179274	179276	179276	Ursula	264	' Imagine that we passed our days here ! '
179278	179282	179284	179284	Gudrun	352	' I know , '
179286	179306	179284	179284	Gudrun	352	' It is too appalling . What must we be like , if we are the contents of THIS ! '
179307	179310	179312	179312	Ursula	264	' Vile ! '
179314	179319	179312	179312	Ursula	264	' It really is . '
179328	179330	179284	179284	Gudrun	352	' Vogue '
179466	179475	179477	179477	Ursula	264	' A cheerful sight , are n't they ? '
179486	179490	179492	179492	Gudrun	352	' Very cheerful , '
179598	179628	179588	179588	They	496	' front bedroom , whose windows looked down on the road , and across the country at the black - barred sunset , black and red barred , without light .
179661	179664	179666	179666	Ursula	264	' Really , '
179668	179678	179666	179666	Ursula	264	' this room COULDN'T be sacred , could it ? '
179687	179690	179691	179691	she	352	' Impossible , '
179694	179736	179679	179679	Gudrun	352	' When I think of their lives - father 's and mother 's , their love , and their marriage , and all of us children , and our bringing - up - would you have such a life , Prune ? '
179737	179744	179679	179679	Gudrun	352	' I would n't , Ursula . '
179745	179789	179679	179679	Gudrun	352	' It all seems so NOTHING - their two lives - there 's no meaning in it . Really , if they had NOT met , and NOT married , and not lived together - it would n't have mattered , would it ? '
179790	179799	179801	179801	Gudrun	352	' Of course - you ca n't tell , '
179803	179821	179822	179822	she	4352	' No . But if I thought my life was going to be like it - Prune , '
179828	179833	179822	179822	she	4352	' I should run . '
179842	179863	179865	179865	Gudrun	352	' As a matter of fact , one can not contemplate the ordinary life - one can not contemplate it , '
179867	180043	179865	179865	Gudrun	352	' With you , Ursula , it is quite different . You will be out of it all , with Birkin . He 's a special case . But with the ordinary man , who has his life fixed in one place , marriage is just impossible . There may be , and there ARE , thousands of women who want it , and could conceive of nothing else . But the very thought of it sends me MAD . One must be free , above all , one must be free . One may forfeit everything else , but one must be free - one must not become 7 , Pinchbeck Street - or Somerset Drive - or Shortlands . No man will be sufficient to make that good - no man ! To marry , one must have a free lance , or nothing , a comrade - in - arms , a Glckstritter . A man with a position in the social world - well , it is just impossible , impossible ! '
180044	180053	180055	180055	Ursula	264	' What a lovely word - a Glckstritter ! '
180057	180067	180055	180055	Ursula	264	' So much nicer than a soldier of fortune . '
180068	180075	180077	180077	Gudrun	352	' Yes , is n't it ? '
180079	180106	180077	180077	Gudrun	352	' I 'd tilt the world with a Glcksritter . But a home , an establishment ! Ursula , what would it mean ? - think ! '
180107	180111	180113	180113	Ursula	264	' I know , '
180115	180128	180113	180113	Ursula	264	' We 've had one home - that 's enough for me . '
180129	180133	180135	180135	Gudrun	352	' Quite enough , '
180137	180146	180148	180148	Ursula	264	' The little grey home in the west , '
180151	180160	180162	180162	Gudrun	352	' Does n't it sound grey , too , '
180216	180219	180220	180220	he	4358	' Hello ! '

180275	180301	180303	180303	Gudrun	352	' These houses do n't have ghosts - they 've never had any personality , and only a place with personality can have a ghost , '
180305	180318	180325	180325	Gudrun	352	' I suppose so . Are you both weeping over the past ? '
180319	180323	180325	180325	Gudrun	352	' We are , '
180332	180347	180348	180348	she	4355	' Not weeping that it 's gone , but weeping that it ever WAS , '
180351	180354	180355	180355	he	4358	' Oh , '
180393	180409	180411	180411	Ursula	264	' Gudrun says she could not bear to be married and put into a house , '
180428	180431	180432	180432	he	4358	' Well , '
180435	180447	180432	180432	he	4358	' if you know beforehand you could n't stand it , you 're

180513	180530	180532	180532	Ursula	264	' But you need n't have the respect for the BETISE before you 've committed it , '
180534	180543	180552	180552	Gudrun	352	' Ah then , des betises du papa ? '
180544	180550	180552	180552	Gudrun	352	' Et de la maman , '
180555	180560	180562	180562	Ursula	264	' Et des voisins , '
180615	180631	180633	180633	Gudrun	352	' Do you mind stopping at Coulsons . I have to leave the key there , '
180635	180638	180640	180640	Birkin	179	' Right , '

188053	188058	188059	188059	she	4444	' Gudrun ! Gudrun ! '
188070	188075	188059	188059	she	4444	' Shu - hu ! '
188095	188100	188101	188101	she	4444	' Really - Ursula ! '
188130	188133	188135	188135	Gudrun	352	' But ! '
188139	188157	188135	188135	Gudrun	352	' We thought it was TOMORROW you were coming ! I wanted to come to the station . '
188158	188166	188168	188168	Ursula	264	' No , we 've come today ! '
188170	188177	188168	188168	Ursula	264	' Is n't it lovely here ! '
188178	188181	188183	188183	Gudrun	352	' Adorable ! '
188185	188203	188183	188183	Gudrun	352	' Gerald 's just gone out to get something . Ursula , are n't you FEARFULLY tired ? '
188204	188222	188135	188135	Gudrun	352	' No , not so very . But I look a filthy sight , do n't I ! '
188223	188243	188244	188244	She	352	' No , you do n't . You look almost perfectly fresh . I like that fur cap IMMENSELY ! '
188274	188278	188280	188280	Ursula	264	' And you ! '
188282	188291	188280	188280	Ursula	264	' What do you think YOU look like ! '
188300	188306	188307	188307	she	352	' Do you like it ? '
188310	188316	188318	188318	Ursula	264	' It 's VERY fine ! '
188327	188335	188337	188337	Birkin	179	' Go up - or come down , '
188408	188412	188414	188414	Gudrun	352	' First floor ? '
188422	188429	188430	188431	the waiter	1016	' Second Madam - the lift ! '
188537	188544	188546	188546	Ursula	264	' Go with Gerald and smoke , '
188550	188558	188546	188546	Ursula	264	' Gudrun and I want to talk . '
188594	188600	188601	188601	she	352	' Where is the letter ? '
188604	188609	188611	188611	Gudrun	352	' I kept it , '
188613	188624	188625	188625	she	352	' You 'll give it me , wo n't you ? '
188640	188649	188637	188637	she	352	' Do you really want it , Ursula ? '
188650	188657	188659	188659	Ursula	264	' I want to read it , '
188661	188664	188666	188666	Gudrun	352	' Certainly , '
188710	188718	188720	188720	Ursula	264	' What did you do in Paris ? '
188722	188725	188727	188727	Gudrun	352	' Oh , '
188730	188748	188727	188727	Gudrun	352	' the usual things . We had a FINE party one night in Fanny Bath 's studio . '
188749	188768	188720	188720	Ursula	264	' Did you ? And you and Gerald were there ! Who else ? Tell me about it . '
188769	188772	188774	188774	Gudrun	352	' Well , '
188776	188992	188774	188774	Gudrun	352	' There 's nothing particular to tell . You know Fanny is FRIGHTFULLY in love with that painter , Billy Macfarlane . He was there - so Fanny spared nothing , she spent VERY freely . It was really remarkable ! Of course , everybody got fearfully drunk - but in an interesting way , not like that filthy London crowd . The fact is these were all people that matter , which makes all the difference . There was a Roumanian , a fine chap . He got completely drunk , and climbed to the top of a high studio ladder , and gave the most marvellous address - really , Ursula , it was wonderful ! He began in French - La vie , c'est une affaire d'ames imperiales - in a most beautiful voice - he was a fine - looking chap - but he had got into Roumanian before he had finished , and not a soul understood . But Donald Gilchrist was worked to a frenzy . He dashed his glass to the ground , and declared , by God , he was glad he had been born , by God , it was a miracle to be alive . And do you know , Ursula , so it was - '
188998	189007	189009	189009	Ursula	264	' But how was Gerald among them all ? '
189011	189030	188774	188774	Gudrun	352	' Gerald ! Oh , my word , he came out like a dandelion in the sun ! HE 'S
189091	189091	189087	189087	you	0	'
189104	189107	189108	189108	she	0	' Yes , '
189111	189123	189108	189108	she	0	' I can . He is such a whole - hogger . '
189124	189134	189136	189136	Gudrun	352	' Whole - hogger ! I should think so ! '
189138	189243	189136	189136	Gudrun	352	' But it is true , Ursula , every woman in the room was ready to surrender to him . Chanticleer is n't in it - even Fanny Bath , who is GENUINELY in love with Billy Macfarlane ! I never was more amazed in my life ! And you know , afterwards - I felt I was a whole ROOMFUL of women . I was no more myself to him , than I was Queen Victoria . I was a whole roomful of women at once . It was most astounding ! But my eye , I 'd caught a Sultan that time - '
189391	189402	189404	189404	Gudrun	352	' Do n't you love to be in this place ? '
189406	189436	189404	189404	Gudrun	352	' Is n't the snow wonderful ! Do you notice how it exalts everything ? It is simply marvellous . One really does feel LIBERMENSCHLICH - more than human . '
189437	189441	189443	189443	Ursula	264	' One does , '
189445	189457	189443	189443	Ursula	264	' But is n't that partly the being out of England ? '
189458	189464	189466	189466	Gudrun	352	' Oh , of course , '
189468	189511	189466	189466	Gudrun	352	' One could never feel like this in England , for the simple reason that the damper is NEVER lifted off one , there . It is quite impossible really to let go , in England , of that I am assured . '
189530	189536	189538	189538	Gerald	264	' It 's quite true , '
189540	189597	189538	189538	Gerald	264	' it never is quite the same in England . But perhaps we do n't want it to be - perhaps it 's like bringing the light a little too near the powder - magazine , to let go altogether , in England . One is afraid what might happen , if EVERYBODY ELSE let go . '
189598	189602	189604	189604	Gudrun	352	' My God ! '
189606	189627	189604	189604	Gudrun	352	' But would n't it be wonderful , if all England did suddenly go off like a display of fireworks . '
189628	189633	189635	189635	Ursula	264	' It could n't , '
189637	189651	189635	189635	Ursula	264	' They are all too damp , the powder is damp in them . '
189652	189654	189538	189538	Gerald	264	' I 'm
189661	189664	189538	189538	Gerald	264	' said Gerald .
189665	189669	189671	189671	Birkin	179	' Nor I , '
189673	189697	189671	189671	Birkin	179	' When the English really begin to go off , EN MASSE , it 'll be time to shut your ears and run . '
189698	189703	189705	189705	Ursula	264	' They never will , '
189707	189712	189713	189713	he	264	' We 'll see , '
189716	189722	189724	189724	Gudrun	352	' Is n't it marvellous , '
189726	189776	189724	189724	Gudrun	352	' how thankful one can be , to be out of one 's country . I can not believe myself , I am so transported , the moment I set foot on a foreign shore . I say to myself " Here steps a new creature into life . " '
189777	189788	189790	189790	Gerald	264	' Do n't be too hard on poor old England , '
189792	189803	189790	189790	Gerald	264	' Though we curse it , we love it really . '
189817	189821	189823	189823	Birkin	179	' We may , '
189825	189857	189823	189823	Birkin	179	' But it 's a damnably uncomfortable love : like a love for an aged parent who suffers horribly from a complication of diseases , for which there is no hope . '
189867	189875	189876	189876	she	352	' You think there is no hope ? '
189897	189933	189946	189946	Gudrun	352	' Any hope of England 's becoming real ? God knows . It 's a great actual unreality now , an aggregation into unreality . It might be real , if there were no Englishmen . '
189934	189944	189946	189946	Gudrun	352	' You think the English will have to disappear ? '
190013	190042	190010	190010	he	4598	' Well - what else is in front of them , but disappearance ? They 've got to disappear from their own special brand of Englishness , anyhow . '
190061	190073	190074	190074	she	352	' But in what way do you mean , disappear ? - '
190077	190088	190091	190091	Gerald	264	' Yes , do you mean a change of heart ? '
190093	190104	190106	190106	Birkin	179	' I do n't mean anything , why should I ? '
190108	190110	190106	190106	Birkin	179	' I 'm
190137	190137	190130	190130	I	0	'
190138	190141	190143	190143	Gudrun	352	' Yes , '
190146	190156	190143	190143	Gudrun	352	' you love England immensely , IMMENSELY , Rupert . '
190157	190162	190163	190163	he	4598	' And leave her , '
190166	190178	190180	190180	Gerald	264	' No , not for good . You 'll come back , '
190185	190196	190198	190198	Birkin	179	' They say the lice crawl off a dying body , '
190206	190212	190198	190198	Birkin	179	' So I leave England . '
190213	190222	190224	190224	Gudrun	352	' Ah , but you 'll come back , '
190231	190237	190238	190238	he	4598	' Tant pis pour moi , '
190241	190251	190253	190253	Gerald	264	' Is n't he angry with his mother country ! '
190257	190263	190265	190265	Gudrun	352	' Ah , a patriot ! '
190421	190427	190428	190428	she	352	' What are they then ? '
190438	190441	190442	190442	he	264	' What ? '
190452	190456	190487	190487	her	352	' Your thoughts . '
190465	190472	190473	190473	he	264	' I think I had none , '
190476	190479	190480	190480	she	352	' Really ! '
190505	190509	190511	190511	Gudrun	352	' Ah but , '
190513	190526	190511	190511	Gudrun	352	' let us drink to Britannia - let us drink to Britannia . '
190545	190551	190552	190552	he	264	' I think Rupert means , '
190555	190571	190552	190552	he	264	' that NATIONALLY all Englishmen must die , so that they can exist individually and - '
190572	190577	190580	190580	Gudrun	352	' Super - nationally - '
190677	190683	190684	190684	she	352	' My God , Jerry , '
190694	190701	190684	190684	she	352	' you 've done it now . '
190702	190705	190732	190732	He	264	' What ? '
190719	190724	190706	190706	She	352	' Look at it ! '
190783	190793	190795	190795	Ursula	264	' It makes one feel so small and alone , '
190808	190810	190802	190802	her	352	' You 're
190820	190825	190818	190818	you	352	' said Gerald to Gudrun .
190841	190844	190846	190846	Gerald	264	' Ah , '
190854	190877	190846	190846	Gerald	264	' this is perfect . There 's our sledge . We 'll walk a bit - we 'll run up the road . '
191153	191164	191166	191166	Gudrun	352	' It 's a marvellous place , for all that , '
191183	191186	191187	191187	he	264	' Good , '
191326	191334	191335	191335	she	4626	' This is something I never expected , '
191338	191347	191335	191335	she	4626	' It is a different world , here . '
191934	191944	191945	191945	Gerald	264	' It is n't too rough , is it ? '
191960	191965	191966	191966	she	352	' It is wonderful , '
191969	191988	191966	191966	she	352	' Look at the colour of this panelling - it 's wonderful , like being inside a nut . '
192042	192049	192050	192050	she	352	' Oh , but this - ! '
192364	192370	192371	192371	he	264	' Do you like it ? '
192816	192820	192821	192821	he	264	' My God , '
192834	192838	192821	192821	he	264	' what next ? '
192868	192875	192876	192876	he	264	' I shall always love you , '
192991	193002	193003	193003	he	264	' Shall we go down and have coffee and Kuchen ? '
193042	193045	193046	193046	she	352	' Yes , '

206283	206294	206295	206295	he	409	' That is quite an early thing - NOT mechanical , '

206771	206795	206796	206796	He	409	' Yes . LOOK how stock and stupid and brutal it is . Horses are sensitive , quite delicate and sensitive , really . '
206826	206830	206831	206831	he	409	' Wissen Sie , '
206844	206915	206831	206831	he	409	' that horse is a certain FORM , part of a whole form . It is part of a work of art , a piece of form .

206954	206966	206967	206967	He	409	' But it IS a picture of a horse , nevertheless . '
206975	206991	206967	206967	He	409	' As you like - it is not a picture of a cow , certainly . '

208513	208520	208522	208522	Gudrun	352	' Did you really slap her ? '
208536	208542	208543	208543	he	421	' Yes , I did , '
208548	208579	208543	208543	he	421	' harder than I have ever beat anything in my life . I had to , I had to . It was the only way I got the work done . '
208612	208623	208625	208625	Gerald	264	' Why did you have such a young Godiva then ? '
208627	208649	208605	208605	she	352	' She is so small , besides , on the horse - not big enough for it - such a child . '
208659	208662	208663	208663	he	421	' Yes , '
208666	208700	208663	208663	he	421	' I do n't like them any bigger , any older . Then they are beautiful , at sixteen , seventeen , eighteen - after that , they are no use to me . '

208721	208743	208716	208716	Loerke	421	' I do n't find them interesting - or beautiful - they are no good to me , for my work . '
208744	208760	208762	208762	Gerald	264	' Do you mean to say a woman is n't beautiful after she is twenty ? '
208764	208812	208848	208848	Loerke	421	' For me , no . Before twenty , she is small and fresh and tender and slight . After that - let her be what she likes , she has nothing for me . The Venus of Milo is a bourgeoise - so are they all . '
208813	208826	208828	208828	Gerald	264	' And you do n't care for women at all after twenty ? '

208888	208898	208900	208900	Loerke	421	' Yes , they are good at all ages , '
208902	208937	208900	208900	Loerke	421	' A man should be big and powerful - whether he is old or young is of no account , so he has the size , something of massiveness and - and stupid form . '

209348	209351	209352	209352	he	5018	' Well , '
209355	209388	209352	209352	he	5018	' we can go away - we can go tomorrow . We 'll go tomorrow to Verona , and find Romeo and Juliet , and sit in the amphitheatre - shall we ? '
209407	209410	209411	209411	she	5005	' Yes , '
209433	209443	209444	209444	she	5005	' I shall love to be Romeo and Juliet , '

209543	209549	209550	209550	he	5018	' Why how 's that ? '
209559	209570	209571	209571	she	5005	' Because I do n't want to be laughed at , '
209588	209594	209595	209595	she	5005	' Do you love me ? '
209602	209605	209606	209606	he	5018	' Yes , '

210021	210024	210026	210026	Gudrun	352	' Really ! '

210475	210486	210473	210473	Ursula	264	' It is n't a question of train - journeys . '
210487	210508	210435	210435	Gudrun	352	' Yes , I know . But spiritually , so to speak , you are going away from us all ? '
210512	210525	210526	210526	she	352	' I do n't know a bit what is going to happen , '
210529	210538	210526	210526	she	352	' I only know we are going somewhere . '

210591	210642	210571	210571	Gudrun	352	' But do n't you think you 'll WANT the old connection with the world - father and the rest of us , and all that it means , England and the world of thought - do n't you think you 'll NEED that , really to make a world ? '
210651	210655	210656	210656	she	352	' I think , '
210663	210686	210656	210656	she	352	' that Rupert is right - one wants a new space to be in , and one falls away from the old . '

210716	210761	210713	210713	she	352	' But I think that a new world is a development from this world , and that to isolate oneself with one other person , is n't to find a new world at all , but only to secure oneself in one 's illusions . '
210808	210811	210812	210812	she	352	' Perhaps , '
210824	210827	210828	210828	she	352	' But , '
210831	210891	210828	210828	she	352	' I do think that one ca n't have anything new whilst one cares for the old - do you know what I mean ? - even fighting the old is belonging to it . I know , one is tempted to stop with the world , just to fight it . But then it is n't worth it . '
210896	210899	210900	210900	she	352	' Yes , '
210903	210973	210900	210900	she	352	' In a way , one is of the world if one lives in it . But is n't it really an illusion to think you can get out of it ? After all , a cottage in the Abruzzi , or wherever it may be , is n't a new world . No , the only thing to do with the world , is to see it through . '
210985	210997	210998	210998	she	352	' But there CAN be something else , ca n't there ? '
211001	211038	210998	210998	she	352	' One can see it through in one 's soul , long enough before it sees itself through in actuality . And then , when one has seen one 's soul , one is something else . '

211114	211117	211118	211118	she	352	' Yes , '

211183	211195	211196	211196	she	352	' And what will happen when you find yourself in space ? '
211201	211245	211196	211196	she	352	' After all , the great ideas of the world are the same there . You above everybody ca n't get away from the fact that love , for instance , is the supreme thing , in space as well as on earth . '

211253	211310	211251	211251	Ursula	264	' it is n't . Love is too human and little . I believe in something inhuman , of which love is only a little part . I believe what we must fulfil comes out of the unknown to us , and it is something infinitely more than love . It is n't so merely HUMAN . '
211345	211358	211335	211335	she	352	' Well , I 've got no further than love , yet . '
211367	211381	211335	211335	she	352	' Because you never HAVE loved , you ca n't get beyond it . '

211655	211679	211652	211652	he	264	' I never know what those common words mean . All right and all wrong , do n't they become synonymous , somewhere ? '
211680	211691	211693	211693	Birkin	179	' Yes , I suppose . How about going back ? '
211695	211717	211719	211719	Gerald	264	' Oh , I do n't know . We may never get back . I do n't look before and after , '
211721	211729	211731	211731	Birkin	179	' NOR pine for what is not , '
211751	211809	211810	211810	He	264	' No . There 's something final about this . And Gudrun seems like the end , to me . I do n't know - but she seems so soft , her skin like silk , her arms heavy and soft . And it withers my consciousness , somehow , it burns the pith of my mind . '
211836	211844	211845	211845	he	264	' It blasts your soul 's eye , '
211848	211875	211845	211845	he	264	' and leaves you sightless . Yet you WANT to be sightless , you WANT to be blasted , you do n't want it any different . '

She 's so beautiful , so perfect , you find her SO GOOD , it tears you like a silk , and every stroke and bit cuts hot - ha , that perfection , when you blast yourself , you blast yourself ! And then - '
211988	212004	212005	212005	he	264	' it 's nothing - your brain might have gone charred as rags - and - '
212016	212040	212005	212005	he	264	' it 's blasting - you understand what I mean - it is a great experience , something final - and then - you 're
212048	212068	212005	212005	he	264	' He walked on in silence . It seemed like bragging , but like a man in extremity bragging truthfully .
212069	212073	212074	212074	he	264	' Of course , '
212077	212111	212074	212074	he	264	' I would n't NOT have had it ! It 's a complete experience . And she 's a wonderful woman . But - how I hate her somewhere ! It 's curious - '
212133	212141	212143	212143	Birkin	179	' But you 've had enough now ? '
212145	212159	212143	212143	Birkin	179	' You have had your experience . Why work on an old wound ? '

212167	212178	212165	212165	Gerald	264	' I do n't know . It 's not finished - '
212185	212200	212202	212202	Birkin	179	' I 've loved you , as well as Gudrun , do n't forget , '

212621	212624	212625	212625	she	352	' Look , '
212628	212642	212625	212625	she	352	' at that lovely star up there . Do you know its name ? '
212655	212658	212659	212659	he	264	' No , '
212662	212668	212659	212659	he	264	' It is very fine . '
212669	212689	212701	212701	she	352	' ISN'T it beautiful ! Do you notice how it darts different coloured fires - it flashes really superbly - '

212924	212946	213007	213007	He	264	' When you first came to me . I HAD to take pity on you . But it was never love . '

212966	212981	212982	212982	he	264	' Why must you repeat it so often , that there is no love ? '
212991	213003	213004	213004	she	352	' Well you do n't THINK you love , do you ? '
213016	213029	213030	213030	she	352	' You do n't think you CAN love me , do you ? '

213555	213594	213552	213552	he	264	' You are so insistent , and there is so little grace in you , so little fineness . You are so crude . You break me - you only waste me - it is horrible to me . '
213595	213600	213601	213601	he	264	' Horrible to you ? '
213604	213633	213552	213552	he	264	' Yes . Do n't you think I might have a room to myself , now Ursula has gone ? You can say you want a dressing room . '

215603	215624	215593	215593	he	264	' I shall destroy YOU , as you stand looking at the sunset ; because you are such a liar . '

220570	220634	220565	220565	he	421	' that is impossible . Leave that to the CANAILLE who can do nothing else . You , for your part - you know , you are a remarkable woman , eine seltsame Frau . Why deny it - why make any question of it ? You are an extraordinary woman , why should you follow the ordinary course , the ordinary life ? '

221549	221597	221598	221598	he	5174	' It is that you have a certain wit , it is the kind of understanding . For me , I am little , chetif , insignificant . Good ! Do not ask me to be strong and handsome , then . But it is the ME - '
221608	221643	221598	221598	he	5174	' it is the ME that is looking for a mistress , and my ME is waiting for the THEE of the mistress , for the match to my particular intelligence . You understand ? '

223619	223791	223614	223614	she	352	' He does n't . Every woman he comes across he wants to make her in love with him . He does n't even know that he is doing it . But there he is , before every woman he unfurls his male attractiveness , displays his great desirability , he tries to make every woman think how wonderful it would be to have him for a lover . His very ignoring of the women is part of the game . He is never UNCONSCIOUS of them . He should have been a cockerel , so he could strut before fifty females , all his subjects . But really , his Don Juan does NOT interest me . I could play Dona Juanita a million times better than he plays Juan . He bores me , you know . His maleness bores me . Nothing is so boring , so inherently stupid and stupidly conceited . Really , the fathomless conceit of these men , it is ridiculous - the little strutters .
223792	223831	223617	223617	herself	352	' They are all alike . Look at Birkin . Built out of the limitation of conceit they are , and nothing else . Really , nothing but their ridiculous limitation and intrinsic insignificance could make them so conceited .
223832	223928	223614	223614	she	352	' As for Loerke , there is a thousand times more in him than in a Gerald . Gerald is so limited , there is a dead end to him . He would grind on at the old mills forever . And really , there is no corn between the millstones any more . They grind on and on , when there is nothing to grind - saying the same things , believing the same things , acting the same things . Oh , my God , it would wear out the patience of a stone .
223929	224070	223617	223617	herself	352	' I do n't worship Loerke , but at any rate , he is a free individual . He is not stiff with conceit of his own maleness . He is not grinding dutifully at the old mills . Oh God , when I think of Gerald , and his work - those offices at Beldover , and the mines - it makes my heart sick . What HAVE I to do with it - and him thinking he can be a lover to a woman ! One might as well ask it of a self - satisfied lamp - post . These men , with their eternal jobs - and their eternal mills of God that keep on grinding at nothing ! It is too boring , just boring . However did I come to take him seriously at all !
224071	224318	223614	223614	she	352	' At least in Dresden , one will have one 's back to it all . And there will be amusing things to do . It will be amusing to go to these eurythmic displays , and the German opera , the German theatre . It WILL be amusing to take part in German Bohemian life . And Loerke is an artist , he is a free individual . One will escape from so much , that is the chief thing , escape so much hideous boring repetition of vulgar actions , vulgar phrases , vulgar postures . I do n't delude myself that I shall find an elixir of life in Dresden . I know I sha n't . But I shall get away from people who have their own homes and their own children and their own acquaintances and their own this and their own that . I shall be among people who DON'T own things and who HAVEN'T got a home and a domestic servant in the background , who have n't got a standing and a status and a degree and a circle of friends of the same . Oh God , the wheels within wheels of people , it makes one 's head tick like a clock , with a very madness of dead mechanical monotony and meaninglessness . How I HATE life , how I hate it . How I hate the Geralds , that they can offer one nothing else .

226909	226933	226900	226900	she	352	' can you smell bilberries ? Is n't it wonderful ? It is exactly as if one could smell them through the snow . '
