1270	1353	1260	1260	she	512	" She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance ; but that until she heard from Bessie , and could discover by her own observation , that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition , a more attractive and sprightly manner - something lighter , franker , more natural , as it were - she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented , happy , little children . "
1354	1363	1364	1364	I	0	" What does Bessie say I have done ? "
1367	1410	1260	1260	she	512	" Jane , I do n't like cavillers or questioners ; besides , there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner . Be seated somewhere ; and until you can speak pleasantly , remain silent . "
1645	1651	1653	1653	them	520	" the solitary rocks and promontories "
1682	1714	1653	1653	them	520	" Where the Northern Ocean , in vast whirls , Boils round the naked , melancholy isles Of farthest Thule ; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides . "
1741	1799	1653	1653	them	520	" the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone , and those forlorn regions of dreary space , - that reservoir of frost and snow , where firm fields of ice , the accumulation of centuries of winters , glazed in Alpine heights above heights , surround the pole , and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold . "
2156	2162	2171	2171	he	159	" Boh ! Madam Mope ! "
2181	2188	2189	2189	he	159	" Where the dickens is she ! "
2192	2219	2189	2189	he	159	" Lizzy ! Georgy ! calling to his sisters Joan is not here : tell mama she is run out into the rain - bad animal ! "
2220	2229	2231	2231	I	0	" It is well I drew the curtain , "
2282	2297	2270	2270	her	158	" She is in the window - seat , to be sure , Jack . "
2319	2325	2326	2326	I	0	" What do you want ? "
2333	2346	2326	2326	I	0	" Say , ' What do you want , Master Reed ? ' "
2351	2359	2369	2369	he	159	" I want you to come here ; "
2479	2487	2488	2489	Mr. Miles	170	" on account of his delicate health . "
2810	2822	2824	2824	he	159	" That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since , "
2826	2853	2824	2824	he	159	" and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains , and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since , you rat ! "
2886	2895	2896	2896	he	159	" What were you doing behind the curtain ? "
2899	2904	2896	2896	he	159	" I was reading . "
2905	2910	2911	2911	I	0	" Show the book . "
2921	3033	3044	3044	his	548	" You have no business to take our books ; you are a dependent , mama says ; you have no money ; your father left you none ; you ought to beg , and not to live here with gentlemen 's children like us , and eat the same meals we do , and wear clothes at our mama 's expense . Now , I 'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves : for they ARE mine ; all the house belongs to me , or will do in a few years . Go and stand by the door , out of the way of the mirror and the windows . "

3204	3230	3201	3201	he	549	" Did she say that to me ? Did you hear her , Eliza and Georgiana ? Wo n't I tell mama ? but first - "
3324	3329	3321	3321	he	549	" Rat ! Rat ! "
3378	3392	3354	3354	she	156	" Dear ! dear ! What a fury to fly at Master John ! "
3393	3404	3406	3407	Mrs. Reed	156	" Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion ! "
3410	3426	3406	3407	Mrs. Reed	156	" Take her away to the red - room , and lock her in there . "
3536	3551	3561	3564	the lady's - maid	558	" Hold her arms , Miss Abbot : she 's like a mad cat . "
3552	3559	3561	3564	the lady's - maid	558	" For shame ! for shame ! "
3566	3589	3561	3564	the lady's - maid	558	" What shocking conduct , Miss Eyre , to strike a young gentleman , your benefactress 's son ! Your young master . "
3590	3604	3561	3564	the lady's - maid	558	" Master ! How is he my master ? Am I a servant ? "
3605	3634	3635	3635	They	559	" No ; you are less than a servant , for you do nothing for your keep . There , sit down , and think over your wickedness . "
3678	3692	3694	3694	Bessie	195	" If you do n't sit still , you must be tied down , "
3696	3711	3694	3694	Bessie	195	" Miss Abbot , lend me your garters ; she would break mine directly . "
3747	3754	3755	3755	I	0	" Do n't take them off , "
3758	3764	3755	3755	I	0	" I will not stir . "

3831	3838	3842	3842	Bessie	195	" She never did so before , "
3849	3857	3842	3842	Bessie	195	" But it was always in her , "
3862	3900	3842	3842	Bessie	195	" I 've told Missis often my opinion about the child , and Missis agreed with me . She 's an underhand little thing : I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover . "
3915	3954	3912	3912	she	195	" You ought to be aware , Miss , that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed : she keeps you : if she were to turn you off , you would have to go to the poorhouse . "
4015	4079	4010	4011	Miss Abbot	176	" And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed , because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them . They will have a great deal of money , and you will have none : it is your place to be humble , and to try to make yourself agreeable to them . "
4080	4090	4092	4092	Bessie	195	" What we tell you is for your good , "
4099	4138	4092	4092	Bessie	195	" you should try to be useful and pleasant , then , perhaps , you would have a home here ; but if you become passionate and rude , Missis will send you away , I am sure . "
4139	4142	4144	4145	Miss Abbot	176	" Besides , "
4147	4225	4144	4145	Miss Abbot	176	" God will punish her : He might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums , and then where would she go ? Come , Bessie , we will leave her : I would n't have her heart for anything . Say your prayers , Miss Eyre , when you are by yourself ; for if you do n't repent , something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away . "

6348	6356	6358	6358	Bessie	195	" Miss Eyre , are you ill ? "
6360	6372	6374	6374	Abbot	176	" What a dreadful noise ! it went quite through me ! "
6376	6388	6390	6390	my	0	" Take me out ! Let me go into the nursery ! "
6393	6406	6409	6409	Bessie	195	" What for ? Are you hurt ? Have you seen something ? "
6411	6427	6409	6409	Bessie	195	" Oh ! I saw a light , and I thought a ghost would come . "
6447	6455	6457	6457	Abbot	176	" She has screamed out on purpose , "
6463	6498	6457	6457	Abbot	176	" And what a scream ! If she had been in great pain one would have excused it , but she only wanted to bring us all here : I know her naughty tricks . "
6499	6505	6512	6513	Mrs. Reed	156	" What is all this ? "
6529	6557	6512	6513	Mrs. Reed	156	" Abbot and Bessie , I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left in the red - room till I came to her myself . "
6558	6567	6569	6569	Bessie	195	" Miss Jane screamed so loud , ma'am , "
6571	6576	6569	6569	Bessie	195	" Let her go , "
6582	6652	6569	6569	Bessie	195	" Loose Bessie 's hand , child : you can not succeed in getting out by these means , be assured . I abhor artifice , particularly in children ; it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer : you will now stay here an hour longer , and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you then . "
6653	6683	6739	6740	Mrs. Reed	156	" O aunt ! have pity ! Forgive me ! I can not endure it - let me be punished some other way ! I shall be killed if - "
6684	6694	6701	6701	she	195	" Silence ! This violence is all most repulsive : "
7102	7109	7110	7110	he	642	" Well , who am I ? "
7135	7147	7127	7127	he	642	" We shall do very well by - and - by . "
7238	7250	7252	7252	Bessie	195	" Do you feel as if you should sleep , Miss ? "
7273	7278	7264	7264	I	0	" I will try . "
7279	7292	7252	7252	Bessie	195	" Would you like to drink , or could you eat anything ? "
7293	7301	7252	7252	Bessie	195	" No , thank you , Bessie . "
7302	7332	7252	7252	Bessie	195	" Then I think I shall go to bed , for it is past twelve o'clock ; but you may call me if you want anything in the night . "
7345	7359	7252	7252	Bessie	195	" Bessie , what is the matter with me ? Am I ill ? "
7360	7385	7386	7386	Bessie	195	" You fell sick , I suppose , in the red - room with crying ; you 'll be better soon , no doubt . "
7403	7460	7400	7400	her	195	" Sarah , come and sleep with me in the nursery ; I dare n't for my life be alone with that poor child to - night : she might die ; it 's such a strange thing she should have that fit : I wonder if she saw anything . Missis was rather too hard . "
7510	7522	7497	7497	I	0	" Something passed her , all dressed in white , and vanished "
7524	7531	7497	7497	I	0	" A great black dog behind him "

8490	8495	8480	8480	she	195	" A long time ago "
8520	8562	8507	8507	She	195	" My feet they are sore , and my limbs they are weary ; Long is the way , and the mountains are wild ; Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary Over the path of the poor orphan child . "
8605	8646	8647	8647	Ev'n	188	" Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing , Clouds there are none , and clear stars beam mild , God , in His mercy , protection is showing , Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child . "
8687	8730	8767	8767	she	195	" There is a thought that for strength should avail me , Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled ; Heaven is a home , and a rest will not fail me ; God is a friend to the poor orphan child . "
8731	8741	8743	8743	Bessie	195	" Come , Miss Jane , do n't cry , "
8758	8763	8748	8748	She	195	" do n't burn ! "
8790	8796	8798	8798	he	182	" What , already up ! "
8806	8815	8798	8798	he	182	" Well , nurse , how is she ? "
8825	8849	8816	8816	Bessie	195	" Then she ought to look more cheerful . Come here , Miss Jane : your name is Jane , is it not ? "
8850	8858	8798	8798	he	182	" Yes , sir , Jane Eyre . "
8859	8883	8816	8816	Bessie	195	" Well , you have been crying , Miss Jane Eyre ; can you tell me what about ? Have you any pain ? "
8884	8889	8816	8816	Bessie	195	" No , sir . "
8890	8910	8912	8912	Bessie	195	" Oh ! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in the carriage , "
8914	8928	8912	8912	Bessie	195	" Surely not ! why , she is too old for such pettishness . "
8950	8977	8946	8946	I	0	" I never cried for such a thing in my life : I hate going out in the carriage . I cry because I am miserable . "
8978	8984	8986	8986	Bessie	195	" Oh fie , Miss ! "
9055	9062	9052	9052	he	686	" What made you ill yesterday ? "
9063	9069	9071	9071	Bessie	195	" She had a fall , "
9079	9110	9071	9071	Bessie	195	" Fall ! why , that is like a baby again ! Ca n't she manage to walk at her age ? She must be eight or nine years old . "
9111	9117	9076	9076	her	195	" I was knocked down , "
9134	9143	9144	9144	I	0	" but that did not make me ill , "
9185	9193	9195	9195	he	182	" That 's for you , nurse , "
9197	9215	9195	9195	he	182	" you can go down ; I 'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back . "
9240	9254	9223	9223	she	195	" The fall did not make you ill ; what did , then ? "
9263	9280	9281	9281	I	0	" I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark . "
9293	9311	9283	9284	Mr. Lloyd	182	" Ghost ! What , you are a baby after all ! You are afraid of ghosts ? "
9312	9377	9281	9281	I	0	" Of Mr. Reed 's ghost I am : he died in that room , and was laid out there . Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night , if they can help it ; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle , - so cruel that I think I shall never forget it . "
9378	9397	9281	9281	I	0	" Nonsense ! And is it that makes you so miserable ? Are you afraid now in daylight ? "
9398	9425	9283	9284	Mr. Lloyd	182	" No : but night will come again before long : and besides , - I am unhappy , - very unhappy , for other things . "
9426	9439	9281	9281	I	0	" What other things ? Can you tell me some of them ? "
9539	9555	9515	9515	I	0	" For one thing , I have no father or mother , brothers or sisters . "
9556	9565	9567	9567	I	0	" You have a kind aunt and cousins . "
9574	9593	9567	9567	I	0	" But John Reed knocked me down , and my aunt shut me up in the red- room . "
9605	9617	9619	9619	he	182	" Do n't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house ? "
9621	9637	9619	9619	he	182	" Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at ? "
9638	9661	9567	9567	I	0	" It is not my house , sir ; and Abbot says I have less right to be here than a servant . "
9662	9680	9567	9567	I	0	" Pooh ! you ca n't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place ? "
9681	9712	9619	9619	he	182	" If I had anywhere else to go , I should be glad to leave it ; but I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman . "
9713	9729	9567	9567	I	0	" Perhaps you may - who knows ? Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed ? "
9730	9737	9567	9567	I	0	" I think not , sir . "
9738	9745	9619	9619	he	182	" None belonging to your father ? "
9746	9780	9567	9567	I	0	" I do n't know . I asked Aunt Reed once , and she said possibly I might have some poor , low relations called Eyre , but she knew nothing about them . "
9781	9795	9796	9796	I	0	" If you had such , would you like to go to them ? "
9858	9871	9873	9873	my	0	" No ; I should not like to belong to poor people , "
9876	9886	9873	9873	my	0	" Not even if they were kind to you ? "
9969	9983	9955	9955	I	0	" But are your relatives so very poor ? Are they working people ? "
9984	10015	10037	10037	Bessie	195	" I can not tell ; Aunt . Reed says if I have any , they must be a beggarly set : I should not like to go a begging . "
10016	10025	9955	9955	I	0	" Would you like to go to school ? "
10212	10222	10228	10228	my	0	" I should indeed like to go to school , "
10231	10242	10244	10245	Mr. Lloyd	182	" Well , well ! who knows what may happen ? "
10252	10264	10265	10265	he	182	" The child ought to have change of air and scene , "
10272	10280	10265	10265	he	182	" nerves not in a good state . "
10300	10308	10310	10311	Mr. Lloyd	182	" Is that your mistress , nurse ? "
10313	10325	10326	10326	Bessie	195	" I should like to speak to her before I go . "
10419	10456	10457	10457	Abbot	176	" Missis was , she dared say , glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome , ill- conditioned child , who always looked as if she were watching everybody , and scheming plots underhand . "
10615	10628	10606	10606	she	195	" Poor Miss Jane is to be pitied , too , Abbot . "
10629	10632	10634	10634	Abbot	176	" Yes , "
10636	10666	10606	10606	she	195	" if she were a nice , pretty child , one might compassionate her forlornness ; but one really can not care for such a little toad as that . "
10667	10677	10679	10679	Bessie	195	" Not a great deal , to be sure , "
10681	10700	10679	10679	Bessie	195	" at any rate , a beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition . "
10701	10710	10712	10714	the fervent Abbot	176	" Yes , I doat on Miss Georgiana ! "
10716	10758	10712	10714	the fervent Abbot	176	" Little darling ! - with her long curls and her blue eyes , and such a sweet colour as she has ; just as if she were painted ! - Bessie , I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for supper . "
10759	10776	10777	10777	They	725	" So could I - with a roast onion . Come , we 'll go down . "

11164	11206	11158	11158	he	159	" Do n't talk to me about her , John : I told you not to go near her ; she is not worthy of notice ; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her . "
11228	11238	11214	11214	I	0	" They are not fit to associate with me . "
11307	11321	11323	11323	my	0	" What would Uncle Reed say to you , if he were alive ? "
11362	11365	11370	11370	her	156	" What ? "
11420	11462	11463	11464	Mrs. Reed	156	" My Uncle Reed is in heaven , and can see all you do and think ; and so can papa and mama : they know how you shut me up all day long , and how you wish me dead . "
12098	12105	12091	12091	she	195	" Good night , Miss Jane . "
12940	12965	12932	12932	Bessie	195	" Miss Jane , take off your pinafore ; what are you doing there ? Have you washed your hands and face this morning ? "
13018	13030	13015	13015	I	0	" No , Bessie ; I have only just finished dusting . "
13031	13066	13015	13015	I	0	" Troublesome , careless child ! and what are you doing now ? You look quite red , as if you had been about some mischief : what were you opening the window for ? "
13330	13336	13337	13337	I	0	" Who could want me ? "
13365	13384	13345	13345	I	0	" What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment ? - a man or a woman ? "
13494	13507	13508	13508	HE	794	" This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you . "
13555	13566	13517	13517	his	794	" Her size is small : what is her age ? "
13567	13571	13517	13517	his	794	" Ten years . "
13572	13576	13583	13583	he	794	" So much ? "

13654	13667	13646	13646	his	794	" Well , Jane Eyre , and are you a good child ? "
13705	13719	13689	13690	Mrs. Reed	156	" Perhaps the less said on that subject the better , Mr. Brocklehurst . "
13720	13735	13742	13742	he	794	" Sorry indeed to hear it ! she and I must have some talk ; "
13755	13759	13760	13760	he	794	" Come here , "
13811	13823	13824	13824	he	794	" No sight so sad as that of a naughty child , "
13827	13844	13824	13824	he	794	" especially a naughty little girl . Do you know where the wicked go after death ? "
13845	13851	13853	13853	my	0	" They go to hell , "
13859	13871	13853	13853	my	0	" And what is hell ? Can you tell me that ? "
13872	13879	13824	13824	he	794	" A pit full of fire . "
13880	13899	13824	13824	he	794	" And should you like to fall into that pit , and to be burning there for ever ? "
13900	13905	13853	13853	my	0	" No , sir . "
13906	13915	13916	13916	I	0	" What must you do to avoid it ? "
13932	13944	13921	13921	my	0	" I must keep in good health , and not die . "
13945	14010	13853	13853	my	0	" How can you keep in good health ? Children younger than you die daily . I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since , - a good little child , whose soul is now in heaven . It is to be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called hence . "
14046	14073	14041	14041	myself	0	" I hope that sigh is from the heart , and that you repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress . "
14074	14079	14081	14081	I	0	" Benefactress ! benefactress ! "
14084	14103	14081	14081	I	0	" they all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress ; if so , a benefactress is a disagreeable thing . "
14104	14114	14116	14117	my interrogator	798	" Do you say your prayers night and morning ? "
14119	14124	14116	14117	my interrogator	798	" Yes , sir . "
14125	14132	14041	14041	myself	0	" Do you read your Bible ? "
14133	14136	14041	14041	myself	0	" Sometimes . "
14137	14147	14116	14117	my interrogator	798	" With pleasure ? Are you fond of it ? "
14148	14184	14041	14041	myself	0	" I like Revelations , and the book of Daniel , and Genesis and Samuel , and a little bit of Exodus , and some parts of Kings and Chronicles , and Job and Jonah . "
14185	14196	14041	14041	myself	0	" And the Psalms ? I hope you like them ? "
14197	14202	14116	14117	my interrogator	798	" No , sir . "
14203	14297	14116	14117	my interrogator	798	" No ? oh , shocking ! I have a little boy , younger than you , who knows six Psalms by heart : and when you ask him which he would rather have , a gingerbread - nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn , he says : ' Oh ! the verse of a Psalm ! angels sing Psalms ; ' says he , ' I wish to be a little angel here below ; ' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety . "
14298	14304	14305	14305	I	0	" Psalms are not interesting , "
14308	14351	14305	14305	I	0	" That proves you have a wicked heart ; and you must pray to God to change it : to give you a new and clean one : to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh . "
14397	14496	14387	14387	she	156	" Mr. Brocklehurst , I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you three weeks ago , that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish : should you admit her into Lowood school , I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her , and , above all , to guard against her worst fault , a tendency to deceit . I mention this in your hearing , Jane , that you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst . "
14641	14646	14648	14648	I	0	" Nothing , indeed , "
14672	14685	14687	14688	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" Deceit is , indeed , a sad fault in a child , "
14690	14734	14687	14688	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" it is akin to falsehood , and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone ; she shall , however , be watched , Mrs. Reed . I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers . "
14735	14751	14753	14754	my benefactress	4444	" I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects , "
14756	14785	14753	14754	my benefactress	4444	" to be made useful , to be kept humble : as for the vacations , she will , with your permission , spend them always at Lowood . "
14786	14795	14687	14688	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" Your decisions are perfectly judicious , madam , "
14800	14963	14797	14798	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" Humility is a Christian grace , and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood ; I , therefore , direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them . I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride ; and , only the other day , I had a pleasing proof of my success . My second daughter , Augusta , went with her mama to visit the school , and on her return she exclaimed : ' Oh , dear papa , how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look , with their hair combed behind their ears , and their long pinafores , and those little holland pockets outside their frocks - they are almost like poor people 's children ! and , ' said she , ' they looked at my dress and mama 's , as if they had never seen a silk gown before . ' "
14964	14975	14977	14978	Mrs. Reed	156	" This is the state of things I quite approve , "
14980	15018	14977	14978	Mrs. Reed	156	" had I sought all England over , I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre . Consistency , my dear Mr. Brocklehurst ; I advocate consistency in all things . "
15019	15074	14797	14798	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" Consistency , madam , is the first of Christian duties ; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood : plain fare , simple attire , unsophisticated accommodations , hardy and active habits ; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants . "
15075	15108	14977	14978	Mrs. Reed	156	" Quite right , sir . I may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at Lowood , and there being trained in conformity to her position and prospects ? "
15109	15142	14797	14798	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" Madam , you may : she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants , and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election . "
15143	15180	14797	14798	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" I will send her , then , as soon as possible , Mr. Brocklehurst ; for , I assure you , I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome . "
15181	15259	14977	14978	Mrs. Reed	156	" No doubt , no doubt , madam ; and now I wish you good morning . I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two : my good friend , the Archdeacon , will not permit me to leave him sooner . I shall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl , so that there will he no difficulty about receiving her . Good - bye . "
15260	15287	14797	14798	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" Good - bye , Mr. Brocklehurst ; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst , and to Augusta and Theodore , and Master Broughton Brocklehurst . "
15288	15341	14977	14978	Mrs. Reed	156	" I will , madam . Little girl , here is a book entitled the ' Child 's Guide , ' read it with prayer , especially that part containing ' An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G - , a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit . ' "
15690	15702	15673	15673	her	156	" Go out of the room ; return to the nursery , "
15800	15867	15788	15788	I	0	" I am not deceitful : if I were , I should say I loved you ; but I declare I do not love you : I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed ; and this book about the liar , you may give to your girl , Georgiana , for it is she who tells lies , and not I. "
15890	15898	15899	15899	she	156	" What more have you to say ? "
15954	16029	15951	15951	I	0	" I am glad you are no relation of mine : I will never call you aunt again as long as I live . I will never come to see you when I am grown up ; and if any one asks me how I liked you , and how you treated me , I will say the very thought of you makes me sick , and that you treated me with miserable cruelty . "
16030	16040	15951	15951	I	0	" How dare you affirm that , Jane Eyre ? "
16041	16204	15951	15951	I	0	" How dare I , Mrs. Reed ? How dare I ? Because it is the TRUTH . You think I have no feelings , and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness ; but I can not live so : and you have no pity . I shall remember how you thrust me back - roughly and violently thrust me back - into the red - room , and locked me up there , to my dying day ; though I was in agony ; though I cried out , while suffocating with distress , ' Have mercy ! Have mercy , Aunt Reed ! ' And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me - knocked me down for nothing . I will tell anybody who asks me questions , this exact tale . People think you a good woman , but you are bad , hard- hearted . YOU are deceitful ! "
16301	16332	16297	16297	she	156	" Jane , you are under a mistake : what is the matter with you ? Why do you tremble so violently ? Would you like to drink some water ? "
16333	16339	16264	16265	Mrs. Reed	156	" No , Mrs. Reed . "
16340	16362	16277	16277	she	156	" Is there anything else you wish for , Jane ? I assure you , I desire to be your friend . "
16363	16399	16297	16297	she	156	" Not you . You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character , a deceitful disposition ; and I 'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are , and what you have done . "
16400	16418	16264	16265	Mrs. Reed	156	" Jane , you do n't understand these things : children must be corrected for their faults . "
16419	16426	16427	16427	I	0	" Deceit is not my fault ! "
16437	16468	16427	16427	I	0	" But you are passionate , Jane , that you must allow : and now return to the nursery - there 's a dear - and lie down a little . "
16469	16498	16264	16265	Mrs. Reed	156	" I am not your dear ; I can not lie down : send me to school soon , Mrs. Reed , for I hate to live here . "
16499	16509	16511	16512	Mrs. Reed	156	" I will indeed send her to school soon , "
17027	17032	17059	17061	a wretched child	828	" onding on snaw , "
17072	17084	17056	17056	I	0	" What shall I do ? - what shall I do ? "
17095	17107	17110	17110	Bessie	195	" Miss Jane ! where are you ? Come to lunch ! "
17132	17138	17139	17139	she	195	" You naughty little thing ! "
17142	17153	17139	17139	she	195	" Why do n't you come when you are called ? "
17235	17244	17224	17224	I	0	" Come , Bessie ! do n't scold . "
17266	17276	17277	17277	she	195	" You are a strange child , Miss Jane , "
17287	17305	17277	17277	she	195	" a little roving , solitary thing : and you are going to school , I suppose ? "
17309	17321	17277	17277	she	195	" And wo n't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie ? "
17322	17336	17277	17277	she	195	" What does Bessie care for me ? She is always scolding me . "
17337	17356	17277	17277	she	195	" Because you 're such a queer , frightened , shy little thing . You should be bolder . "
17357	17365	17277	17277	she	195	" What ! to get more knocks ? "
17366	17425	17277	17277	she	195	" Nonsense ! But you are rather put upon , that 's certain . My mother said , when she came to see me last week , that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place . - Now , come in , and I 've some good news for you . "
17426	17436	17277	17277	she	195	" I do n't think you have , Bessie . "
17437	17537	17277	17277	she	195	" Child ! what do you mean ? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me ! Well , but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon , and you shall have tea with me . I 'll ask cook to bake you a little cake , and then you shall help me to look over your drawers ; for I am soon to pack your trunk . Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a day or two , and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you . "
17538	17554	17277	17277	she	195	" Bessie , you must promise not to scold me any more till I go . "
17555	17594	17277	17277	she	195	" Well , I will ; but mind you are a very good girl , and do n't be afraid of me . Do n't start when I chance to speak rather sharply ; it 's so provoking . "
17595	17631	17277	17277	she	195	" I do n't think I shall ever be afraid of you again , Bessie , because I have got used to you , and I shall soon have another set of people to dread . "
17632	17642	17277	17277	she	195	" If you dread them they 'll dislike you . "
17643	17650	17277	17277	she	195	" As you do , Bessie ? "
17651	17673	17277	17277	she	195	" I do n't dislike you , Miss ; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the others . "
17674	17681	17277	17277	she	195	" You do n't show it . "
17682	17706	17277	17277	she	195	" You little sharp thing ! you 've got quite a new way of talking . What makes you so venturesome and hardy ? "
17707	17720	17277	17277	she	195	" Why , I shall soon be away from you , and besides "
17753	17763	17742	17742	I	0	" And so you 're glad to leave me ? "
17764	17780	17277	17277	she	195	" Not at all , Bessie ; indeed , just now I 'm rather sorry . "
17781	17824	17742	17742	I	0	" Just now ! and rather ! How coolly my little lady says it ! I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you would n't give it me : you 'd say you 'd RATHER not . "
17825	17838	17839	17839	Bessie	195	" I 'll kiss you and welcome : bend your head down . "
18109	18121	18106	18106	she	195	" Will you go in and bid Missis good - bye ? "
18122	18185	18106	18106	she	195	" No , Bessie : she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper , and said I need not disturb her in the morning , or my cousins either ; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend , and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly . "
18186	18194	18106	18106	she	195	" What did you say , Miss ? "
18195	18214	18106	18106	she	195	" Nothing : I covered my face with the bedclothes , and turned from her to the wall . "
18215	18223	18106	18106	she	195	" That was wrong , Miss Jane . "
18224	18246	18106	18106	she	195	" It was quite right , Bessie . Your Missis has not been my friend : she has been my foe . "
18247	18257	18106	18106	she	195	" O Miss Jane ! do n't say so ! "
18258	18265	18267	18267	I	0	" Good - bye to Gateshead ! "
18418	18425	18427	18428	the porter	846	" Is she going by herself ? "
18432	18435	18427	18428	the porter	846	" Yes . "
18436	18443	18492	18493	the guard	855	" And how far is it ? "
18444	18448	18427	18428	the porter	846	" Fifty miles . "
18449	18469	18427	18428	the porter	846	" What a long way ! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone . "
18521	18531	18533	18533	she	195	" Be sure and take good care of her , "
18546	18551	18539	18539	he	855	" Ay , ay ! "
18565	18569	18535	18536	the guard	855	" All right , "
18809	18949	18796	18796	his	872	" of L- . The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty : as it waned into dusk , I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead : we ceased to pass through towns ; the country changed ; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon : as twilight deepened , we descended a valley , dark with wood , and long after night had overclouded the prospect , I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees . Lulled by the sound , I at last dropped asleep ; I had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me ; the coach - door was open , and a person like a servant was standing at it : I saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps . "
18960	18966	18796	18796	his	872	" she asked . I answered "
18969	19261	18796	18796	his	872	" and was then lifted out ; my trunk was handed down , and the coach instantly drove away . I was stiff with long sitting , and bewildered with the noise and motion of the coach : Gathering my faculties , I looked about me . Rain , wind , and darkness filled the air ; nevertheless , I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it ; through this door I passed with my new guide : she shut and locked it behind her . There was now visible a house or houses - for the building spread far - with many windows , and lights burning in some ; we went up a broad pebbly path , splashing wet , and were admitted at a door ; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire , where she left me alone . I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze , then I looked round ; there was no candle , but the uncertain light from the hearth showed , by intervals , papered walls , carpet , curtains , shining mahogany furniture : it was a parlour , not so spacious or splendid as the drawing - room at Gateshead , but comfortable enough . I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall , when the door opened , and an individual carrying a light entered ; another followed close behind . The first was a tall lady with dark hair , dark eyes , and a pale and large forehead ; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl , her countenance was grave , her bearing erect . "
19272	19298	19299	19299	She	4339	" said she , putting her candle down on the table . She considered me attentively for a minute or two , then further added - "
19316	19327	19308	19308	she	4339	" she asked , placing her hand on my shoulder . "
19333	19334	19308	19308	she	4339	" "
19375	19431	19432	19432	She	4339	" I explained to her that I had no parents . She inquired how long they had been dead : then how old I was , what was my name , whether I could read , write , and sew a little : then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger , and saying , "
19441	19742	19432	19432	She	4339	" dismissed me along with Miss Miller . The lady I had left might be about twenty - nine ; the one who went with me appeared some years younger : the first impressed me by her voice , look , and air . Miss Miller was more ordinary ; ruddy in complexion , though of a careworn countenance ; hurried in gait and action , like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand : she looked , indeed , what I afterwards found she really was , an under - teacher . Led by her , I passed from compartment to compartment , from passage to passage , of a large and irregular building ; till , emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed , we came upon the hum of many voices , and presently entered a wide , long room , with great deal tables , two at each end , on each of which burnt a pair of candles , and seated all round on benches , a congregation of girls of every age , from nine or ten to twenty . Seen by the dim light of the dips , their number to me appeared countless , though not in reality exceeding eighty ; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion , and long holland pinafores . It was the hour of study ; they were engaged in conning over their to- morrow 's task , and the hum I had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions . Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door , then walking up to the top of the long room she cried out - "
19783	19792	19774	19775	Miss Miller	207	" Monitors , fetch the supper - trays ! "
20208	20212	20204	20204	she	207	" Form classes ! "
20228	20231	20223	20224	Miss Miller	207	" Silence ! "
20233	20236	20223	20224	Miss Miller	207	" Order ! "
20566	20575	20553	20559	the tall girls of the first class	905	" Disgusting ! The porridge is burnt again ! "
20576	20579	20553	20559	the tall girls of the first class	905	" Silence ! "
20891	20898	20883	20883	them	919	" Abominable stuff ! How shameful ! "
21059	21066	21042	21043	Miss Miller	207	" Silence ! To your seats ! "
21452	21463	21445	21445	her	942	" Monitor of the first class , fetch the globes ! "
21813	21824	21826	21826	she	4451	" I have a word to address to the pupils , "
21850	21885	21846	21846	She	4451	" You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat ; you must be hungry : - I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all . "
21897	21907	21908	21908	she	4451	" It is to be done on my responsibility , "

22851	22870	22812	22812	I	0	" And why do they call it Institution ? Is it in any way different from other schools ? "
22871	22913	22812	22812	I	0	" It is partly a charity - school : you and I , and all the rest of us , are charity - children . I suppose you are an orphan : are not either your father or your mother dead ? "
22914	22922	22812	22812	I	0	" Both died before I can remember . "
22923	22948	22812	22812	I	0	" Well , all the girls here have lost either one or both parents , and this is called an institution for educating orphans . "
22949	22963	22812	22812	I	0	" Do we pay no money ? Do they keep us for nothing ? "
22964	22980	22812	22812	I	0	" We pay , or our friends pay , fifteen pounds a year for each . "
22981	22992	22812	22812	I	0	" Then why do they call us charity - children ? "
22993	23013	22812	22812	I	0	" Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching , and the deficiency is supplied by subscription . "
23014	23018	22812	22812	I	0	" Who subscribes ? "
23019	23034	22812	22812	I	0	" Different benevolent - minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in London . "

23042	23067	22812	22812	I	0	" The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records , and whose son overlooks and directs everything here . "
23068	23071	22812	22812	I	0	" Why ? "
23072	23083	22812	22812	I	0	" Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment . "
23084	23112	22812	22812	I	0	" Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch , and who said we were to have some bread and cheese ? "
23113	23150	22812	22812	I	0	" To Miss Temple ? Oh , no ! I wish it did : she has to answer to Mr. Brocklehurst for all she does . Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes . "
23151	23157	22812	22812	I	0	" Does he live here ? "
23158	23170	22812	22812	I	0	" No - two miles off , at a large hall . "
23171	23178	22812	22812	I	0	" Is he a good man ? "
23179	23196	22812	22812	I	0	" He is a clergyman , and is said to do a great deal of good . "
23197	23209	22812	22812	I	0	" Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple ? "
23210	23213	22812	22812	I	0	" Yes . "
23214	23223	22812	22812	I	0	" And what are the other teachers called ? "
23224	23323	22812	22812	I	0	" The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith ; she attends to the work , and cuts out - for we make our own clothes , our frocks , and pelisses , and everything ; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd ; she teaches history and grammar , and hears the second class repetitions ; and the one who wears a shawl , and has a pocket - handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband , is Madame Pierrot : she comes from Lisle , in France , and teaches French . "
23324	23331	22812	22812	I	0	" Do you like the teachers ? "
23332	23336	22812	22812	I	0	" Well enough . "
23337	23362	22812	22812	I	0	" Do you like the little black one , and the Madame - ? - I can not pronounce her name as you do . "
23363	23388	22812	22812	I	0	" Miss Scatcherd is hasty - you must take care not to offend her ; Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person . "
23389	23401	22812	22812	I	0	" But Miss Temple is the best - is n't she ? "
23402	23427	22812	22812	I	0	" Miss Temple is very good and very clever ; she is above the rest , because she knows far more than they do . "
23428	23435	22812	22812	I	0	" Have you been long here ? "
23436	23440	22812	22812	I	0	" Two years . "
23441	23447	22812	22812	I	0	" Are you an orphan ? "
23448	23454	22812	22812	I	0	" My mother is dead . "
23455	23461	22812	22812	I	0	" Are you happy here ? "
23462	23486	22812	22812	I	0	" You ask rather too many questions . I have given you answers enough for the present : now I want to read . "
23727	23739	23740	23740	I	0	" How can she bear it so quietly - so firmly ? "
23745	23875	23740	23740	I	0	" Were I in her place , it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up . She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment - beyond her situation : of something not round her nor before her . I have heard of day - dreams - is she in a day - dream now ? Her eyes are fixed on the floor , but I am sure they do not see it - her sight seems turned in , gone down into her heart : she is looking at what she can remember , I believe ; not at what is really present . I wonder what sort of a girl she is - whether good or naughty . "
24401	24403	24390	24390	she	211	" Burns "
24426	24445	24390	24390	she	211	" Burns , you are standing on the side of your shoe ; turn your toes out immediately . "
24446	24460	24390	24390	she	211	" Burns , you poke your chin most unpleasantly ; draw it in . "
24461	24484	24390	24390	she	211	" Burns , I insist on your holding your head up ; I will not have you before me in that attitude , "
24597	24613	24592	24592	she	211	" You dirty , disagreeable girl ! you have never cleaned your nails this morning ! "
24625	24628	24630	24630	I	0	" Why , "
24632	24655	24630	24630	I	0	" does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face , as the water was frozen ? "
24881	24885	24887	24888	Miss Scatcherd	211	" Hardened girl ! "
24890	24905	24887	24888	Miss Scatcherd	211	" nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits : carry the rod away . "
25301	25309	25310	25310	I	0	" Is it still ' Rasselas ' ? "
25317	25320	25321	25321	she	213	" Yes , "
25324	25332	25321	25321	she	213	" and I have just finished it . "
25349	25352	25354	25354	I	0	" Now , "
25356	25365	25354	25354	I	0	" I can perhaps get her to talk . "
25375	25383	25366	25366	I	0	" What is your name besides Burns ? "
25384	25387	25354	25354	I	0	" Helen . "
25388	25398	25354	25354	I	0	" Do you come a long way from here ? "
25399	25415	25366	25366	I	0	" I come from a place farther north , quite on the borders of Scotland . "
25416	25423	25354	25354	I	0	" Will you ever go back ? "
25424	25438	25354	25354	I	0	" I hope so ; but nobody can be sure of the future . "
25439	25447	25366	25366	I	0	" You must wish to leave Lowood ? "
25448	25481	25354	25354	I	0	" No ! why should I ? I was sent to Lowood to get an education ; and it would be of no use going away until I have attained that object . "
25482	25496	25354	25354	I	0	" But that teacher , Miss Scatcherd , is so cruel to you ? "
25497	25513	25366	25366	I	0	" Cruel ? Not at all ! She is severe : she dislikes my faults . "
25514	25556	25354	25354	I	0	" And if I were in your place I should dislike her ; I should resist her . If she struck me with that rod , I should get it from her hand ; I should break it under her nose . "
25557	25635	25354	25354	I	0	" Probably you would do nothing of the sort : but if you did , Mr. Brocklehurst would expel you from the school ; that would be a great grief to your relations . It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself , than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you ; and besides , the Bible bids us return good for evil . "
25636	25684	25727	25727	her	1025	" But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged , and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people ; and you are such a great girl : I am far younger than you , and I could not bear it . "
25685	25724	25727	25727	her	1025	" Yet it would be your duty to bear it , if you could not avoid it : it is weak and silly to say you CANNOT BEAR what it is your fate to be required to bear . "
25805	25825	25795	25795	I	0	" You say you have faults , Helen : what are they ? To me you seem very good . "
25826	25921	25938	25938	my	0	" Then learn from me , not to judge by appearances : I am , as Miss Scatcherd said , slatternly ; I seldom put , and never keep , things , in order ; I am careless ; I forget rules ; I read when I should learn my lessons ; I have no method ; and sometimes I say , like you , I can not BEAR to be subjected to systematic arrangements . This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd , who is naturally neat , punctual , and particular . "
25922	25928	25929	25929	I	0	" And cross and cruel , "
25945	25957	25941	25941	she	213	" Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd ? "
25976	26083	25938	25938	my	0	" Miss Temple is full of goodness ; it pains her to be severe to any one , even the worst in the school : she sees my errors , and tells me of them gently ; and , if I do anything worthy of praise , she gives me my meed liberally . One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is , that even her expostulations , so mild , so rational , have not influence to cure me of my faults ; and even her praise , though I value it most highly , can not stimulate me to continued care and foresight . "
26084	26089	26091	26091	I	0	" That is curious , "
26093	26102	26091	26091	I	0	" it is so easy to be careful . "
26103	26258	25938	25938	my	0	" For YOU I have no doubt it is . I observed you in your class this morning , and saw you were closely attentive : your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you . Now , mine continually rove away ; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd , and collecting all she says with assiduity , often I lose the very sound of her voice ; I fall into a sort of dream . Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland , and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden , near our house ; - then , when it comes to my turn to reply , I have to be awakened ; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook , I have no answer ready . "
26259	26268	26424	26424	she	213	" Yet how well you replied this afternoon . "
26269	26416	26417	26417	Helen	213	" It was mere chance ; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me . This afternoon , instead of dreaming of Deepden , I was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did ; and I thought what a pity it was that , with his integrity and conscientiousness , he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown . If he had but been able to look to a distance , and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending ! Still , I like Charles - I respect him - I pity him , poor murdered king ! Yes , his enemies were the worst : they shed blood they had no right to shed . How dared they kill him ! "
26457	26471	26450	26450	I	0	" And when Miss Temple teaches you , do your thoughts wander then ? "
26472	26518	26424	26424	she	213	" No , certainly , not often ; because Miss Temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own reflections ; her language is singularly agreeable to me , and the information she communicates is often just what I wished to gain . "
26519	26531	26424	26424	she	213	" Well , then , with Miss Temple you are good ? "
26532	26560	26450	26450	I	0	" Yes , in a passive way : I make no effort ; I follow as inclination guides me . There is no merit in such goodness . "
26561	26671	26424	26424	she	213	" A great deal : you are good to those who are good to you . It is all I ever desire to be . If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust , the wicked people would have it all their own way : they would never feel afraid , and so they would never alter , but would grow worse and worse . When we are struck at without a reason , we should strike back again very hard ; I am sure we should - so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again . "
26672	26697	26424	26424	she	213	" You will change your mind , I hope , when you grow older : as yet you are but a little untaught girl . "
26698	26759	26450	26450	I	0	" But I feel this , Helen ; I must dislike those who , whatever I do to please them , persist in disliking me ; I must resist those who punish me unjustly . It is as natural as that I should love those who show me affection , or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved . "
26760	26777	26424	26424	she	213	" Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine , but Christians and civilised nations disown it . "
26778	26786	26424	26424	she	213	" How ? I do n't understand . "
26787	26805	26450	26450	I	0	" It is not violence that best overcomes hate - nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury . "
26806	26810	26424	26424	she	213	" What then ? "
26811	26840	26424	26424	she	213	" Read the New Testament , and observe what Christ says , and how He acts ; make His word your rule , and His conduct your example . "
26841	26847	26450	26450	I	0	" What does He say ? "
26848	26871	26424	26424	she	213	" Love your enemies ; bless them that curse you ; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you . "
26872	26897	26899	26899	her	1026	" Then I should love Mrs. Reed , which I can not do ; I should bless her son John , which is impossible . "
26969	26972	26965	26965	she	213	" Well , "
26977	26990	26973	26973	I	0	" is not Mrs. Reed a hard - hearted , bad woman ? "
26991	27366	27367	27367	Helen	213	" She has been unkind to you , no doubt ; because you see , she dislikes your cast of character , as Miss Scatcherd does mine ; but how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you ! What a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart ! No ill - usage so brands its record on my feelings . Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity , together with the passionate emotions it excited ? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs . We are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world : but the time will soon come when , I trust , we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies ; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh , and only the spark of the spirit will remain , - the impalpable principle of light and thought , pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature : whence it came it will return ; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man - perhaps to pass through gradations of glory , from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph ! Surely it will never , on the contrary , be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend ? No ; I can not believe that : I hold another creed : which no one ever taught me , and which I seldom mention ; but in which I delight , and to which I cling : for it extends hope to all : it makes Eternity a rest - a mighty home , not a terror and an abyss . Besides , with this creed , I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime ; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last : with this creed revenge never worries my heart , degradation never too deeply disgusts me , injustice never crushes me too low : I live in calm , looking to the end . "
27435	27471	27419	27422	a great rough girl	1027	" Helen Burns , if you do n't go and put your drawer in order , and fold up your work this minute , I 'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it ! "
27985	27990	27982	27982	she	201	" like stalwart soldiers . "
28619	28623	28645	28645	he	196	" Coming Man , "
28738	28918	28919	28919	He	1065	" I suppose , Miss Temple , the thread I bought at Lowton will do ; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises , and I sorted the needles to match . You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles , but she shall have some papers sent in next week ; and she is not , on any account , to give out more than one at a time to each pupil : if they have more , they are apt to be careless and lose them . And , O ma'am ! I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to ! - when I was here last , I went into the kitchen - garden and examined the clothes drying on the line ; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair : from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time . "
28922	28932	28934	28935	Miss Temple	201	" Your directions shall be attended to , sir , "
28937	28942	28943	28943	he	1065	" And , ma'am , "
28946	28975	28943	28943	he	1065	" the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week : it is too much ; the rules limit them to one . "
28976	29018	29019	29020	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" I think I can explain that circumstance , sir . Agnes and Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday , and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion . "
29023	29115	29019	29020	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" Well , for once it may pass ; but please not to let the circumstance occur too often . And there is another thing which surprised me ; I find , in settling accounts with the housekeeper , that a lunch , consisting of bread and cheese , has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight . How is this ? I looked over the regulations , and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned . Who introduced this innovation ? and by what authority ? "
29116	29127	29129	29130	Miss Temple	201	" I must be responsible for the circumstance , sir , "
29132	29162	29129	29130	Miss Temple	201	" the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it ; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner - time . "
29163	29374	29019	29020	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" Madam , allow me an instant . You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is , not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence , but to render them hardy , patient , self - denying . Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur , such as the spoiling of a meal , the under or the over dressing of a dish , the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost , thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution ; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils , by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation . A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed , wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians ; to the torments of martyrs ; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself , calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him ; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God ; to His divine consolations , "
29389	29431	29432	29433	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" Oh , madam , when you put bread and cheese , instead of burnt porridge , into these children 's mouths , you may indeed feed their vile bodies , but you little think how you starve their immortal souls ! "
29572	29600	29560	29560	he	196	" Miss Temple , Miss Temple , what - WHAT is that girl with curled hair ? Red hair , ma'am , curled - curled all over ? "
29620	29626	29628	29629	Miss Temple	201	" It is Julia Severn , "
29634	29692	29628	29629	Miss Temple	201	" Julia Severn , ma'am ! And why has she , or any other , curled hair ? Why , in defiance of every precept and principle of this house , does she conform to the world so openly - here in an evangelical , charitable establishment - as to wear her hair one mass of curls ? "
29693	29700	29702	29703	Miss Temple	201	" Julia 's hair curls naturally , "
29709	29820	29702	29703	Miss Temple	201	" Naturally ! Yes , but we are not to conform to nature ; I wish these girls to be the children of Grace : and why that abundance ? I have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely , modestly , plainly . Miss Temple , that girl 's hair must be cut off entirely ; I will send a barber to - morrow : and I see others who have far too much of the excrescence - that tall girl , tell her to turn round . Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall . "
29957	29968	29969	29970	Miss Temple	201	" All those top - knots must be cut off . "

29982	30073	29979	29979	he	196	" I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of this world : my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh ; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame - facedness and sobriety , not with braided hair and costly apparel ; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven ; these , I repeat , must be cut off ; think of the time wasted , of - "
30461	30466	30468	30469	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" A careless girl ! "
30475	30485	30468	30469	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" It is the new pupil , I perceive . "
30493	30507	30468	30469	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her . "
30518	30529	30468	30469	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" Let the child who broke her slate come forward ! "

30826	30900	30814	30814	their	1092	" You see she is yet young ; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood ; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of us ; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character . Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her ? Yet such , I grieve to say , is the case . "

30956	31131	30948	30951	the black marble clergyman	1093	" this is a sad , a melancholy occasion ; for it becomes my duty to warn you , that this girl , who might be one of God 's own lambs , is a little castaway : not a member of the true flock , but evidently an interloper and an alien . You must be on your guard against her ; you must shun her example ; if necessary , avoid her company , exclude her from your sports , and shut her out from your converse . Teachers , you must watch her : keep your eyes on her movements , weigh well her words , scrutinise her actions , punish her body to save her soul : if , indeed , such salvation be possible , for my tongue falters while I tell it this girl , this child , the native of a Christian land , worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut - this girl is - a liar ! "

31197	31317	31193	31194	Mr. Brocklehurst	196	" This I learned from her benefactress ; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state , reared her as her own daughter , and whose kindness , whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad , so dreadful , that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones , fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity : she has sent her here to be healed , even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda ; and , teachers , superintendent , I beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her . "

32044	32050	32051	32051	she	213	" Come , eat something , "
32146	32164	32139	32139	I	0	" Helen , why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar ? "
32165	32192	32136	32137	an Indian	1120	" Everybody , Jane ? Why , there are only eighty people who have heard you called so , and the world contains hundreds of millions . "
32193	32212	32136	32137	an Indian	1120	" But what have I to do with millions ? The eighty , I know , despise me . "
32213	32242	32139	32139	I	0	" Jane , you are mistaken : probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you : many , I am sure , pity you much . "
32243	32256	32136	32137	an Indian	1120	" How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said ? "
32257	32378	32380	32380	she	1121	" Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god : nor is he even a great and admired man : he is little liked here ; he never took steps to make himself liked . Had he treated you as an especial favourite , you would have found enemies , declared or covert , all around you ; as it is , the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared . Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two , but friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts ; and if you persevere in doing well , these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression . Besides , Jane "
32383	32388	32390	32390	I	0	" Well , Helen ? "
32411	32444	32398	32398	she	1121	" If all the world hated you , and believed you wicked , while your own conscience approved you , and absolved you from guilt , you would not be without friends . "
32445	32550	32398	32398	she	1121	" No ; I know I should think well of myself ; but that is not enough : if others do n't love me I would rather die than live - I can not bear to be solitary and hated , Helen . Look here ; to gain some real affection from you , or Miss Temple , or any other whom I truly love , I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken , or to let a bull toss me , or to stand behind a kicking horse , and let it dash its hoof at my chest - "
32551	32780	32398	32398	she	1121	" Hush , Jane ! you think too much of the love of human beings ; you are too impulsive , too vehement ; the sovereign hand that created your frame , and put life into it , has provided you with other resources than your feeble self , or than creatures feeble as you . Besides this earth , and besides the race of men , there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits : that world is round us , for it is everywhere ; and those spirits watch us , for they are commissioned to guard us ; and if we were dying in pain and shame , if scorn smote us on all sides , and hatred crushed us , angels see our tortures , recognise our innocence if innocent we be : as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second - hand from Mrs. Reed ; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front , and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward . Why , then , should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress , when life is so soon over , and death is so certain an entrance to happiness - to glory ? "
32947	32959	32961	32961	she	213	" I came on purpose to find you , Jane Eyre , "
32963	32984	32961	32961	she	213	" I want you in my room ; and as Helen Burns is with you , she may come too . "
33055	33061	33062	33062	she	201	" Is it all over ? "
33071	33079	33062	33062	she	201	" Have you cried your grief away ? "
33080	33090	33048	33048	she	201	" I am afraid I never shall do that . "
33091	33094	33048	33048	she	201	" Why ? "
33095	33118	33048	33048	she	201	" Because I have been wrongly accused ; and you , ma'am , and everybody else , will now think me wicked . "
33119	33148	33048	33048	she	201	" We shall think you what you prove yourself to be , my child . Continue to act as a good girl , and you will satisfy us . "
33149	33156	33163	33163	she	1126	" Shall I , Miss Temple ? "
33157	33161	33163	33163	she	1126	" You will , "
33171	33187	33163	33163	she	1126	" And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress ? "
33188	33210	33163	33163	she	1126	" Mrs. Reed , my uncle 's wife . My uncle is dead , and he left me to her care . "
33211	33225	33163	33163	she	1126	" Did she not , then , adopt you of her own accord ? "
33226	33267	33163	33163	she	1126	" No , ma'am ; she was sorry to have to do it : but my uncle , as I have often heard the servants say , got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me . "
33268	33335	33336	33336	I	0	" Well now , Jane , you know , or at least I will tell you , that when a criminal is accused , he is always allowed to speak in his own defence . You have been charged with falsehood ; defend yourself to me as well as you can . Say whatever your memory suggests is true ; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing . "
33565	33606	33561	33561	she	201	" I know something of Mr. Lloyd ; I shall write to him ; if his reply agrees with your statement , you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation ; to me , Jane , you are clear now . "
33671	33689	33664	33664	she	201	" How are you to - night , Helen ? Have you coughed much to - day ? "
33690	33701	33664	33664	she	201	" Not quite so much , I think , ma'am . "
33702	33710	33664	33664	she	201	" And the pain in your chest ? "
33711	33718	33664	33664	she	201	" It is a little better . "
33766	33784	33762	33762	she	201	" But you two are my visitors to - night ; I must treat you as such . "
33790	33793	33794	33794	she	201	" Barbara , "
33803	33823	33794	33794	she	201	" I have not yet had tea ; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies . "

33910	33929	33908	33908	she	201	" can you not bring a little more bread and butter ? There is not enough for three . "
33938	33952	33953	33954	Mrs. Harden	230	" Madam , Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity . "
33983	33989	33991	33992	Miss Temple	201	" Oh , very well ! "
33994	34006	33991	33992	Miss Temple	201	" we must make it do , Barbara , I suppose . "
34017	34033	34012	34012	she	201	" Fortunately , I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once . "
34094	34110	34112	34112	she	201	" I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you , "
34114	34129	34131	34131	she	201	" but as there is so little toast , you must have it now , "
34666	34674	34659	34659	she	201	" God bless you , my children ! "

37756	37793	37794	37795	The nurse	510	" Oh no , child ! It is not likely ; and now it is time for you to come in ; you 'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling . "

38388	38427	38376	38376	she	213	" I got on to her crib and kissed her : her forehead was cold , and her cheek both cold and thin , and so were her hand and wrist ; but she smiled as of old . "

38598	38628	38532	38532	Helen	213	" I did so : she put her arm over me , and I nestled close to her . After a long silence , she resumed , still whispering - "

When I awoke it was day : an unusual movement roused me ; I looked up ; I was in somebody 's arms ; the nurse held me ; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory . I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed ; people had something else to think about ; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions ; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss Temple , on returning to her own room at dawn , had found me laid in the little crib ; my face against Helen Burns 's shoulder , my arms round her neck . I was asleep , and Helen was - dead . Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard : for fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound ; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot , inscribed with her name , and the word "
39305	40640	39123	39123	Helen	235	" CHAPTER X Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant existence : to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many chapters . But this is not to be a regular autobiography . I am only bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some degree of interest ; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in silence : a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection . When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood , it gradually disappeared from thence ; but not till its virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school . Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge , and by degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree . The unhealthy nature of the site ; the quantity and quality of the children 's food ; the brackish , fetid water used in its preparation ; the pupils ' wretched clothing and accommodations - all these things were discovered , and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst , but beneficial to the institution . Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation ; new regulations were made ; improvements in diet and clothing introduced ; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee . Mr. Brocklehurst , who , from his wealth and family connections , could not be overlooked , still retained the post of treasurer ; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds : his office of inspector , too , was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness , comfort with economy , compassion with uprightness . The school , thus improved , became in time a truly useful and noble institution . I remained an inmate of its walls , after its regeneration , for eight years : six as pupil , and two as teacher ; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance . During these eight years my life was uniform : but not unhappy , because it was not inactive . I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach ; a fondness for some of my studies , and a desire to excel in all , together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers , especially such as I loved , urged me on : I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me . In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class ; then I was invested with the office of teacher ; which I discharged with zeal for two years : but at the end of that time I altered . Miss Temple , through all changes , had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary : to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements ; her friendship and society had been my continual solace ; she had stood me in the stead of mother , governess , and , latterly , companion . At this period she married , removed with her husband a clergyman , an excellent man , almost worthy of such a wife to a distant county , and consequently was lost to me . From the day she left I was no longer the same : with her was gone every settled feeling , every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me . I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits : more harmonious thoughts : what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind . I had given in allegiance to duty and order ; I was quiet ; I believed I was content : to the eyes of others , usually even to my own , I appeared a disciplined and subdued character . But destiny , in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth , came between me and Miss Temple : I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post - chaise , shortly after the marriage ceremony ; I watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow ; and then retired to my own room , and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half - holiday granted in honour of the occasion . I walked about the chamber most of the time . I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss , and thinking how to repair it ; but when my reflections were concluded , and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone , and evening far advanced , another discovery dawned on me , namely , that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process ; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple - or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity - and that now I was left in my natural element , and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions . It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn , but rather as if a motive were gone : it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me , but the reason for tranquillity was no more . My world had for some years been in Lowood : my experience had been of its rules and systems ; now I remembered that the real world was wide , and that a varied field of hopes and fears , of sensations and excitements , awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse , to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils . I went to my window , opened it , and looked out . There were the two wings of the building ; there was the garden ; there were the skirts of Lowood ; there was the hilly horizon . My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote , the blue peaks ; it was those I longed to surmount ; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison - ground , exile limits . I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain , and vanishing in a gorge between two ; how I longed to follow it farther ! I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach ; I remembered descending that hill at twilight ; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood , and I had never quitted it since . My vacations had all been spent at school : Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead ; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me . I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world : school - rules , school - duties , school - habits and notions , and voices , and faces , and phrases , and costumes , and preferences , and antipathies - such was what I knew of existence . And now I felt that it was not enough ; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon . I desired liberty ; for liberty I gasped ; for liberty I uttered a prayer ; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing . I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication ; for change , stimulus : that petition , too , seemed swept off into vague space : "
40643	40650	39123	39123	Helen	235	" I cried , half desperate , "
40659	40823	39123	39123	Helen	235	" Here a bell , ringing the hour of supper , called me downstairs . I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime : even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject to which I longed to recur , by a prolonged effusion of small talk . How I wished sleep would silence her . It seemed as if , could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood at the window , some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief . Miss Gryce snored at last ; she was a heavy Welshwoman , and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance ; to - night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction ; I was debarrassed of interruption ; my half - effaced thought instantly revived . "
40834	40849	40850	40850	I	0	" I soliloquised mentally , be it understood ; I did not talk aloud , "
40981	41021	41024	41024	I	0	" I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain : it was a chilly night ; I covered my shoulders with a shawl , and then I proceeded TO THINK again with all my might . "
41107	41235	41236	41240	Those who want situations advertise	1291	" I could not tell : nothing answered me ; I then ordered my brain to find a response , and quickly . It worked and worked faster : I felt the pulses throb in my head and temples ; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos ; and no result came of its efforts . Feverish with vain labour , I got up and took a turn in the room ; undrew the curtain , noted a star or two , shivered with cold , and again crept to bed . A kind fairy , in my absence , had surely dropped the required suggestion on my pillow ; for as I lay down , it came quietly and naturally to my mind . - "

41346	41411	41412	41417	A young lady accustomed to tuition	1296	" This scheme I went over twice , thrice ; it was then digested in my mind ; I had it in a clear practical form : I felt satisfied , and fell asleep . With earliest day , I was up : I had my advertisement written , enclosed , and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school ; it ran thus:- "
41418	41428	41412	41417	A young lady accustomed to tuition	1296	" had I not been a teacher two years ? "
41492	41513	41470	41470	She	1296	" in those days , reader , this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments , would have been held tolerably comprehensive . "
41526	41810	42114	42114	she	1302	" This document remained locked in my drawer all day : after tea , I asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton , in order to perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow - teachers ; permission was readily granted ; I went . It was a walk of two miles , and the evening was wet , but the days were still long ; I visited a shop or two , slipped the letter into the post - office , and came back through heavy rain , with streaming garments , but with a relieved heart . The succeeding week seemed long : it came to an end at last , however , like all sublunary things , and once more , towards the close of a pleasant autumn day , I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton . A picturesque track it was , by the way ; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale : but that day I thought more of the letters , that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound , than of the charms of lea and water . My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes ; so I discharged that business first , and when it was done , I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker 's to the post - office : it was kept by an old dame , who wore horn spectacles on her nose , and black mittens on her hands . "
41818	41891	42114	42114	she	1302	" I asked . She peered at me over her spectacles , and then she opened a drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time , so long that my hopes began to falter . At last , having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes , she presented it across the counter , accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance - it was for J.E. "
41897	41901	42114	42114	she	1302	" I demanded . "
41907	42093	42114	42114	she	1302	" said she ; and I put it in my pocket and turned my face homeward : I could not open it then ; rules obliged me to be back by eight , and it was already half - past seven . Various duties awaited me on my arrival . I had to sit with the girls during their hour of study ; then it was my turn to read prayers ; to see them to bed : afterwards I supped with the other teachers . Even when we finally retired for the night , the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion : we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick , and I dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out ; fortunately , however , the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect : she was already snoring before I had finished undressing . There still remained an inch of candle : I now took out my letter ; the seal was an initial F. ; I broke it ; the contents were brief . "
42179	42190	42191	42191	I	0	" Mrs. Fairfax , Thornfield , near Millcote , -shire . "
42471	42474	42475	42475	I	0	" but , "
42478	42492	42475	42475	I	0	" Thornfield will , probably , be a good way from the town . "
42672	42690	42663	42664	that lady	1013	" I might do as I pleased : she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs . "
43033	43036	43038	43054	a servant who met me in the lobby , where I was wandering like a troubled spirit	1334	" Miss , "
43056	43065	43038	43054	a servant who met me in the lobby , where I was wandering like a troubled spirit	1334	" a person below wishes to see you . "
43066	43073	43074	43074	I	0	" The carrier , no doubt , "
43117	43134	43112	43113	some one	637	" It 's her , I am sure ! - I could have told her anywhere ! "
43183	43190	43191	43191	she	1343	" Well , who is it ? "
43205	43219	43191	43191	she	1343	" you 've not quite forgotten me , I think , Miss Jane ? "
43231	43238	43223	43223	I	0	" Bessie ! Bessie ! Bessie ! "
43279	43286	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" That is my little boy , "
43291	43299	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" Then you are married , Bessie ? "
43300	43330	43246	43246	she	1343	" Yes ; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven , the coachman ; and I 've a little girl besides Bobby there , that I 've christened Jane . "
43331	43340	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" And you do n't live at Gateshead ? "
43341	43354	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" I live at the lodge : the old porter has left . "
43355	43393	43246	43246	she	1343	" Well , and how do they all get on ? Tell me everything about them , Bessie : but sit down first ; and , Bobby , come and sit on my knee , will you ? "
43403	43420	43422	43423	Mrs. Leaven	242	" You 're not grown so very tall , Miss Jane , nor so very stout , "
43425	43462	43422	43423	Mrs. Leaven	242	" I dare say they 've not kept you too well at school : Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are ; and Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth . "
43463	43473	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" Georgiana is handsome , I suppose , Bessie ? "
43474	43573	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" Very . She went up to London last winter with her mama , and there everybody admired her , and a young lord fell in love with her : but his relations were against the match ; and - what do you think ? - he and Miss Georgiana made it up to run away ; but they were found out and stopped . It was Miss Reed that found them out : I believe she was envious ; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together ; they are always quarrelling - "
43574	43583	43422	43423	Mrs. Leaven	242	" Well , and what of John Reed ? "
43584	43652	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" Oh , he is not doing so well as his mama could wish . He went to college , and he got - plucked , I think they call it : and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister , and study the law : but he is such a dissipated young man , they will never make much of him , I think . "
43653	43660	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" What does he look like ? "
43661	43685	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" He is very tall : some people call him a fine - looking young man ; but he has such thick lips . "
43686	43691	43422	43423	Mrs. Leaven	242	" And Mrs. Reed ? "
43692	43730	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" Missis looks stout and well enough in the face , but I think she 's not quite easy in her mind : Mr. John 's conduct does not please her- -he spends a deal of money . "
43731	43740	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" Did she send you here , Bessie ? "
43741	43803	43288	43288	Bessie	195	" No , indeed : but I have long wanted to see you , and when I heard that there had been a letter from you , and that you were going to another part of the country , I thought I 'd just set off , and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach . "
43804	43816	43817	43817	I	0	" I am afraid you are disappointed in me , Bessie . "
43841	43881	43882	43882	I	0	" No , Miss Jane , not exactly : you are genteel enough ; you look like a lady , and it is as much as ever I expected of you : you were no beauty as a child . "
43936	43946	43948	43948	Bessie	195	" I dare say you are clever , though , "
43955	43968	43948	43948	Bessie	195	" What can you do ? Can you play on the piano ? "
43969	43973	43981	43981	Bessie	195	" A little . "
44012	44022	44024	44024	she	195	" The Miss Reeds could not play as well ! "
44027	44043	44024	44024	she	195	" I always said you would surpass them in learning : and can you draw ? "
44044	44057	44074	44075	the superintendent	4451	" That is one of my paintings over the chimney - piece . "
44098	44145	44092	44092	she	195	" Well , that is beautiful , Miss Jane ! It is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed 's drawing - master could paint , let alone the young ladies themselves , who could not come near it : and have you learnt French ? "
44146	44160	44024	44024	she	195	" Yes , Bessie , I can both read it and speak it . "
44161	44171	44024	44024	she	195	" And you can work on muslin and canvas ? "
44172	44176	44092	44092	she	195	" I can . "
44177	44230	44024	44024	she	195	" Oh , you are quite a lady , Miss Jane ! I knew you would be : you will get on whether your relations notice you or not . There was something I wanted to ask you . Have you ever heard anything from your father 's kinsfolk , the Eyres ? "
44231	44237	44024	44024	she	195	" Never in my life . "
44238	44356	44092	44092	she	195	" Well , you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable : and they may be poor ; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are ; for one day , nearly seven years ago , a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you ; Missis said you were it school fifty miles off ; he seemed so much disappointed , for he could not stay : he was going on a voyage to a foreign country , and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two . He looked quite a gentleman , and I believe he was your father 's brother . "
44357	44368	44024	44024	she	195	" What foreign country was he going to , Bessie ? "
44369	44388	44092	44092	she	195	" An island thousands of miles off , where they make wine - the butler did tell me - "
44389	44392	44393	44393	I	0	" Madeira ? "
44396	44409	44393	44393	I	0	" Yes , that is it - that is the very word . "
44410	44415	44092	44092	she	195	" So he went ? "
44416	44456	44092	44092	she	195	" Yes ; he did not stay many minutes in the house : Missis was very high with him ; she called him afterwards a ' sneaking tradesman . ' My Robert believes he was a wine - merchant . "
44457	44461	44393	44393	I	0	" Very likely , "
44465	44477	44478	44478	Bessie	195	" or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine - merchant . "
44812	44814	44801	44801	I	0	" boots "
45008	45019	45000	45000	I	0	" Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield ? "
45030	45047	45048	45048	He	1370	" Thornfield ? I do n't know , ma'am ; I 'll inquire at the bar . "
45055	45063	45048	45048	He	1370	" Is your name Eyre , Miss ? "
45064	45067	45048	45048	He	1370	" Yes . "
45068	45075	45076	45076	I	0	" Person here waiting for you . "
45118	45128	45130	45131	the man	1375	" This will be your luggage , I suppose ? "
45147	45150	45151	45151	He	1375	" Yes . "
45188	45195	45178	45178	I	0	" A matter of six miles . "
45196	45207	45173	45173	he	1375	" How long shall we be before we get there ? "
45208	45216	45217	45217	He	1375	" Happen an hour and a half . "
45283	45287	45289	45289	I	0	" I suppose , "
45291	45473	45289	45289	I	0	" judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage , Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person : so much the better ; I never lived amongst fine people but once , and I was very miserable with them . I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl ; if so , and if she is in any degree amiable , I shall surely be able to get on with her ; I will do my best ; it is a pity that doing one 's best does not always answer . At Lowood , indeed , I took that resolution , kept it , and succeeded in pleasing ; but with Mrs. Reed , I remember my best was always spurned with scorn . I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed ; but if she does , I am not bound to stay with her ! let the worst come to the worst , I can advertise again . How far are we on our road now , I wonder ? "
45604	45615	45599	45599	his	1388	" You 're noan so far fro ' Thornfield now . "
45746	45755	45757	45758	the girl	982	" Will you walk this way , ma'am ? "
45969	46003	45954	45956	the old lady	1406	" How do you do , my dear ? I am afraid you have had a tedious ride ; John drives so slowly ; you must be cold , come to the fire . "
46004	46011	46013	46013	I.	0	" Mrs. Fairfax , I suppose ? "
46014	46025	46026	46026	She	1406	" Yes , you are right : do sit down . "
46059	46101	46103	46103	she	1406	" Oh , it is no trouble ; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold . Leah , make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two : here are the keys of the storeroom . "
46122	46133	46134	46134	she	1406	" Now , then , draw nearer to the fire , "
46137	46153	46134	46134	she	1406	" You 've brought your luggage with you , have n't you , my dear ? "
46154	46159	46106	46106	her	1406	" Yes , ma'am . "
46160	46170	46171	46171	she	1406	" I 'll see it carried into your room , "
46178	46186	46171	46171	she	1406	" She treats me like a visitor , "
46189	46226	46227	46227	She	1406	" I little expected such a reception ; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness : this is not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses ; but I must not exult too soon . "
46324	46338	46339	46339	I	0	" Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to - night ? "
46352	46367	46369	46371	the good lady	1411	" What did you say , my dear ? I am a little deaf , "
46387	46407	46380	46380	I	0	" Miss Fairfax ? Oh , you mean Miss Varens ! Varens is the name of your future pupil . "
46408	46418	46380	46380	I	0	" Indeed ! Then she is not your daughter ? "
46419	46428	46429	46429	I	0	" No , - I have no family . "
46473	46479	46480	46480	she	249	" I am so glad , "
46499	46775	46480	46480	she	249	" I am so glad you are come ; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion . To be sure it is pleasant at any time ; for Thornfield is a fine old hall , rather neglected of late years perhaps , but still it is a respectable place ; yet you know in winter - time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters . I say alone - Leah is a nice girl to be sure , and John and his wife are very decent people ; but then you see they are only servants , and one ca n't converse with them on terms of equality : one must keep them at due distance , for fear of losing one 's authority . I 'm sure last winter it was a very severe one , if you recollect , and when it did not snow , it rained and blew , not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house , from November till February ; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone ; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes ; but I do n't think the poor girl liked the task much : she felt it confining . In spring and summer one got on better : sunshine and long days make such a difference ; and then , just at the commencement of this autumn , little Adela Varens came and her nurse : a child makes a house alive all at once ; and now you are here I shall be quite gay . "
46818	46832	46834	46834	she	1412	" But I 'll not keep you sitting up late to - night , "
46836	46933	46834	46834	she	1412	" it is on the stroke of twelve now , and you have been travelling all day : you must feel tired . If you have got your feet well warmed , I 'll show you your bedroom . I 've had the room next to mine prepared for you ; it is only a small apartment , but I thought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers : to be sure they have finer furniture , but they are so dreary and solitary , I never sleep in them myself . "
48134	48140	48142	48142	she	1013	" What ! out already ? "
48144	48153	48142	48142	she	1013	" I see you are an early riser . "
48173	48180	48181	48181	she	1013	" How do you like Thornfield ? "
48193	48196	48197	48197	she	1013	" Yes , "
48200	48256	48197	48197	she	1013	" it is a pretty place ; but I fear it will be getting out of order , unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and reside here permanently ; or , at least , visit it rather oftener : great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor . "
48257	48261	48262	48262	I	0	" Mr. Rochester ! "
48265	48270	48262	48262	I	0	" Who is he ? "
48271	48277	48278	48278	she	1013	" The owner of Thornfield , "
48282	48292	48278	48278	she	1013	" Did you not know he was called Rochester ? "
48331	48335	48336	48336	I	0	" I thought , "
48339	48345	48336	48336	I	0	" Thornfield belonged to you . "
48346	48478	48308	48310	the old lady	1406	" To me ? Bless you , child ; what an idea ! To me ! I am only the housekeeper - the manager . To be sure I am distantly related to the Rochesters by the mother 's side , or at least my husband was ; he was a clergyman , incumbent of Hay - that little village yonder on the hill - and that church near the gates was his . The present Mr. Rochester 's mother was a Fairfax , and second cousin to my husband : but I never presume on the connection - in fact , it is nothing to me ; I consider myself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper : my employer is always civil , and I expect nothing more . "
48479	48488	48336	48336	I	0	" And the little girl - my pupil ! "
48489	48536	48308	48310	the old lady	1406	" She is Mr. Rochester 's ward ; he commissioned me to find a governess for her . He intended to have her brought up in -shire , I believe . Here she comes , with her ' bonne , ' as she calls her nurse . "
48688	48695	48697	48698	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Good morning , Miss Adela , "
48700	48723	48724	48724	She	5027	" Come and speak to the lady who is to teach you , and to make you a clever woman some day . "
48727	48733	48735	48735	she	5027	" C'est le ma gouverante ! "
48749	48755	48735	48735	she	5027	" Mais oui , certainement . "
48756	48761	48762	48762	I	0	" Are they foreigners ? "
48772	48850	48762	48762	I	0	" The nurse is a foreigner , and Adela was born on the Continent ; and , I believe , never left it till within six months ago . When she first came here she could speak no English ; now she can make shift to talk it a little : I do n't understand her , she mixes it so with French ; but you will make out her meaning very well , I dare say . "
49024	49027	49029	49029	she	255	" Ah ! "
49034	49169	49029	49029	she	255	" you speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester does : I can talk to you as I can to him , and so can Sophie . She will be glad : nobody here understands her : Madame Fairfax is all English . Sophie is my nurse ; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked - how it did smoke ! - and I was sick , and so was Sophie , and so was Mr. Rochester . Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon , and Sophie and I had little beds in another place . I nearly fell out of mine ; it was like a shelf . And Mademoiselle - what is your name ? "
49170	49176	49005	49005	she	255	" Eyre - Jane Eyre . "
49177	49331	49351	49351	her	1481	" Aire ? Bah ! I can not say it . Well , our ship stopped in the morning , before it was quite daylight , at a great city - a huge city , with very dark houses and all smoky ; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from ; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land , and Sophie came after , and we all got into a coach , which took us to a beautiful large house , larger than this and finer , called an hotel . We stayed there nearly a week : I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees , called the Park ; and there were many children there besides me , and a pond with beautiful birds in it , that I fed with crumbs . "
49332	49344	49346	49347	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Can you understand her when she runs on so fast ? "
49368	49372	49374	49376	the good lady	1411	" I wish , "
49378	49398	49374	49376	the good lady	1411	" you would ask her a question or two about her parents : I wonder if she remembers them ? "
49399	49402	49403	49403	I	0	" Adele , "
49406	49424	49403	49403	I	0	" with whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of ? "
49425	49500	49501	49501	She	1483	" I lived long ago with mama ; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin . Mama used to teach me to dance and sing , and to say verses . A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama , and I used to dance before them , or to sit on their knees and sing to them : I liked it . Shall I let you hear me sing now ? "
49711	49723	49703	49703	she	259	" Now , Mademoiselle , I will repeat you some poetry . "
49731	49742	49728	49728	she	259	" La Ligue des Rats : fable de La Fontaine . "
49783	49794	49795	49795	I	0	" Was it your mama who taught you that piece ? "
49798	49856	49795	49795	I	0	" Yes , and she just used to say it in this way : ' Qu ' avez vous donc ? lui dit un de ces rats ; parlez ! ' She made me lift my hand - so - to remind me to raise my voice at the question . Now shall I dance for you ? "
49857	49885	49728	49728	she	259	" No , that will do : but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin , as you say , with whom did you live then ? "
49886	50012	49795	49795	I	0	" With Madame Frederic and her husband : she took care of me , but she is nothing related to me . I think she is poor , for she had not so fine a house as mama . I was not long there . Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England , and I said yes ; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic , and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys : but you see he has not kept his word , for he has brought me to England , and now he is gone back again himself , and I never see him . "
50292	50305	50307	50307	she	180	" Your morning school - hours are over now , I suppose , "
50387	50393	50394	50394	I	0	" What a beautiful room ! "
50413	50461	50462	50462	She	180	" Yes ; this is the dining - room . I have just opened the window , to let in a little air and sunshine ; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited ; the drawing - room yonder feels like a vault . "
50611	50623	50625	50625	I.	0	" In what order you keep these rooms , Mrs. Fairfax ! "
50626	50649	50625	50625	I.	0	" No dust , no canvas coverings : except that the air feels chilly , one would think they were inhabited daily . "
50650	50709	50625	50625	I.	0	" Why , Miss Eyre , though Mr. Rochester 's visits here are rare , they are always sudden and unexpected ; and as I observed that it put him out to find everything swathed up , and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival , I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness . "
50710	50722	50625	50625	I.	0	" Is Mr. Rochester an exacting , fastidious sort of man ? "
50723	50750	50625	50625	I.	0	" Not particularly so ; but he has a gentleman 's tastes and habits , and he expects to have things managed in conformity to them . "
50751	50762	50625	50625	I.	0	" Do you like him ? Is he generally liked ? "
50763	50801	50625	50625	I.	0	" Oh , yes ; the family have always been respected here . Almost all the land in this neighbourhood , as far as you can see , has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind . "
50802	50826	50625	50625	I.	0	" Well , but , leaving his land out of the question , do you like him ? Is he liked for himself ? "
50827	50863	50625	50625	I.	0	" I have no cause to do otherwise than like him ; and I believe he is considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants : but he has never lived much amongst them . "
50864	50880	50625	50625	I.	0	" But has he no peculiarities ? What , in short , is his character ? "
50881	50935	50625	50625	I.	0	" Oh ! his character is unimpeachable , I suppose . He is rather peculiar , perhaps : he has travelled a great deal , and seen a great deal of the world , I should think . I dare say he is clever , but I never had much conversation with him . "
50936	50944	50625	50625	I.	0	" In what way is he peculiar ? "
50945	51024	50625	50625	I.	0	" I do n't know - it is not easy to describe - nothing striking , but you feel it when he speaks to you ; you can not be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest , whether he is pleased or the contrary ; you do n't thoroughly understand him , in short - at least , I do n't : but it is of no consequence , he is a very good master . "
51429	51438	51439	51439	I	0	" Do the servants sleep in these rooms ? "
51442	51483	51439	51439	I	0	" No ; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back ; no one ever sleeps here : one would almost say that , if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall , this would be its haunt . "
51484	51496	51507	51508	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" So I think : you have no ghost , then ? "
51497	51505	51507	51508	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" None that I ever heard of , "
51512	51525	51507	51508	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Nor any traditions of one ? no legends or ghost stories ? "
51526	51567	51507	51508	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" I believe not . And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time : perhaps , though , that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now . "
51568	51582	51583	51583	I	0	" Yes - ' after life 's fitful fever they sleep well , ' "
51586	51596	51583	51583	I	0	" Where are you going now , Mrs. Fairfax ? "
51603	51619	51598	51598	she	180	" On to the leads ; will you come and see the view from thence ? "
52070	52074	52075	52075	I	0	" Mrs. Fairfax ! "
52089	52101	52083	52083	her	180	" Did you hear that loud laugh ? Who is it ? "
52102	52111	52112	52112	she	180	" Some of the servants , very likely , "
52115	52120	52112	52112	she	180	" perhaps Grace Poole . "
52121	52127	52128	52128	I	0	" Did you hear it ? "
52132	52162	52128	52128	I	0	" Yes , plainly : I often hear her : she sews in one of these rooms . Sometimes Leah is with her ; they are frequently noisy together . "
52181	52184	52186	52187	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Grace ! "
52323	52330	52332	52333	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Too much noise , Grace , "
52335	52339	52332	52333	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Remember directions ! "
52347	52365	52367	52368	the widow	1549	" She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid 's work , "
52370	52402	52367	52368	the widow	1549	" not altogether unobjectionable in some points , but she does well enough . By - the - bye , how have you got on with your new pupil this morning ? "
52434	52441	52422	52422	Adele	259	" Mesdames , vous etes servies ! "
52444	52451	52422	52422	Adele	259	" J'ai bien faim , moi ! "
53855	53869	53854	53854	her	259	" Revenez bientot , ma bonne amie , ma chere Mdlle . Jeannette , "

54848	54857	54838	54838	I	0	" What the deuce is to do now ? "
55000	55007	54994	54994	I	0	" Are you injured , sir ? "
55035	55041	55042	55042	I	0	" Can I do anything ? "
55046	55055	55056	55056	he	1631	" You must just stand on one side , "
55134	55139	55140	55141	The traveller	1634	" Down , Pilot ! "
55206	55231	55199	55199	I	0	" If you are hurt , and want help , sir , I can fetch some one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay . "
55232	55251	55254	55254	he	1631	" Thank you : I shall do : I have no broken bones , - only a sprain ; "
55268	55271	55199	55199	I	0	" Ugh ! "
55580	55613	55614	55614	He	1639	" I can not think of leaving you , sir , at so late an hour , in this solitary lane , till I see you are fit to mount your horse . "
55634	55646	55648	55648	he	1639	" I should think you ought to be at home yourself , "
55650	55666	55648	55648	he	1639	" if you have a home in this neighbourhood : where do you come from ? "
55667	55715	55623	55623	he	1639	" From just below ; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is moonlight : I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure , if you wish it : indeed , I am going there to post a letter . "
55716	55732	55648	55648	he	1639	" You live just below - do you mean at that house with the battlements ? "
55772	55777	55859	55859	his	1642	" Yes , sir . "
55778	55784	55859	55859	his	1642	" Whose house is it ? "
55785	55790	55859	55859	his	1642	" Mr. Rochester 's . "
55791	55798	55859	55859	his	1642	" Do you know Mr. Rochester ? "
55799	55808	55859	55859	his	1642	" No , I have never seen him . "
55809	55817	55859	55859	his	1642	" He is not resident , then ? "
55818	55821	55859	55859	his	1642	" No . "
55822	55831	55859	55859	his	1642	" Can you tell me where he is ? "
55832	55837	55859	55859	his	1642	" I can not . "
55838	55854	55855	55855	He	1642	" You are not a servant at the hall , of course . You are - "
55909	55915	55896	55896	He	1642	" I am the governess . "
55916	55922	55923	55923	he	1642	" Ah , the governess ! "
55926	55940	55923	55923	he	1642	" deuce take me , if I had not forgotten ! The governess ! "
55967	55977	55978	55978	he	1642	" I can not commission you to fetch help , "
55981	55998	55978	55978	he	1642	" but you may help me a little yourself , if you will be so kind . "
55999	56004	55923	55923	he	1642	" Yes , sir . "
56005	56019	55978	55978	he	1642	" You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick ? "
56020	56023	55978	55978	he	1642	" No . "
56024	56045	55923	55923	he	1642	" Try to get hold of my horse 's bridle and lead him to me : you are not afraid ? "
56150	56154	56155	56155	he	1634	" I see , "
56158	56192	56155	56155	he	1634	" the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet , so all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain ; I must beg of you to come here . "
56196	56200	56201	56201	he	1634	" Excuse me , "
56204	56213	56201	56201	he	1634	" necessity compels me to make you useful . "
56266	56269	56271	56271	he	1634	" Now , "
56282	56296	56271	56271	he	1634	" just hand me my whip ; it lies there under the hedge . "

57398	57408	57363	57363	Leah	195	" Indeed ! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him ? "
57409	57448	57363	57363	Leah	195	" Yes , and Miss Adele ; they are in the dining - room , and John is gone for a surgeon ; for master has had an accident ; his horse fell and his ankle is sprained . "
57449	57458	57363	57363	Leah	195	" Did the horse fall in Hay Lane ? "
57459	57473	57363	57363	Leah	195	" Yes , coming down - hill ; it slipped on some ice . "
57474	57485	57363	57363	Leah	195	" Ah ! Bring me a candle will you Leah ? "
57820	57829	57831	57831	she	259	" ami , Monsieur Edouard Fairfax DE Rochester , "
57887	57893	57895	57895	she	259	" Et cela doit signifier , "
57897	57964	57895	57895	she	259	" qu'il y aura le dedans un cadeau pour moi , et peut - etre pour vous aussi , mademoiselle . Monsieur a parle de vous : il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante , et si elle n'etait pas une petite personne , assez mince et un peu pale . J'ai dit qu'oui : car c'est vrai , n'est - ce pas , mademoiselle ? "
58151	58175	58177	58177	she	180	" Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in the drawing - room this evening , "
58179	58198	58177	58177	she	180	" he has been so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before . "
58199	58207	58208	58208	I	0	" When is his tea - time ? "
58211	58248	58208	58208	I	0	" Oh , at six o'clock : he keeps early hours in the country . You had better change your frock now ; I will go with you and fasten it . Here is a candle . "
58249	58258	58177	58177	she	180	" Is it necessary to change my frock ? "
58259	58278	58208	58208	I	0	" Yes , you had better : I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here . "
58354	58360	58362	58363	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" You want a brooch , "
58677	58685	58691	58691	her	180	" Here is Miss Eyre , sir , "
58712	58719	58721	58721	he	251	" Let Miss Eyre be seated , "
58746	58773	58774	58774	I	0	" What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not ? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her . "
58949	58958	58937	58937	she	180	" Madam , I should like some tea , "
59011	59020	59022	59023	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Will you hand Mr. Rochester 's cup ? "
59027	59034	59022	59023	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Adele might perhaps spill it . "
59066	59087	59049	59049	Adele	259	" N'est - ce pas , monsieur , qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre ? "
59088	59094	59096	59096	he	251	" Who talks of cadeaux ? "
59099	59115	59117	59117	he	251	" Did you expect a present , Miss Eyre ? Are you fond of presents ? "
59134	59155	59117	59117	he	251	" I hardly know , sir ; I have little experience of them : they are generally thought pleasant things . "
59156	59166	59117	59117	he	251	" Generally thought ? But what do YOU think ? "
59167	59217	59117	59117	he	251	" I should be obliged to take time , sir , before I could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance : a present has many faces to it , has it not ? and one should consider all , before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature . "
59218	59251	59117	59117	he	251	" Miss Eyre , you are not so unsophisticated as Adele : she demands a ' cadeau , ' clamorously , the moment she sees me : you beat about the bush . "
59252	59327	59117	59117	he	251	" Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has : she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance , and the right too of custom ; for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings ; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled , since I am a stranger , and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment . "
59328	59376	59117	59117	he	251	" Oh , do n't fall back on over - modesty ! I have examined Adele , and find you have taken great pains with her : she is not bright , she has no talents ; yet in a short time she has made much improvement . "
59377	59411	59117	59117	he	251	" Sir , you have now given me my ' cadeau ; ' I am obliged to you : it is the meed teachers most covet - praise of their pupils ' progress . "
59412	59415	59417	59418	Mr. Rochester	251	" Humph ! "
59428	59434	59436	59437	the master	540	" Come to the fire , "
59511	59522	59502	59502	she	259	" You have been resident in my house three months ? "
59523	59528	59502	59502	she	259	" Yes , sir . "
59529	59536	59502	59502	she	259	" And you came from - ? "
59537	59545	59502	59502	she	259	" From Lowood school , in -shire . "
59546	59559	59502	59502	she	259	" Ah ! a charitable concern . How long were you there ? "
59560	59564	59502	59502	she	259	" Eight years . "
59565	59657	59502	59502	she	259	" Eight years ! you must be tenacious of life . I thought half the time in such a place would have done up any constitution ! No wonder you have rather the look of another world . I marvelled where you had got that sort of face . When you came on me in Hay Lane last night , I thought unaccountably of fairy tales , and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse : I am not sure yet . Who are your parents ? "
59658	59663	59502	59502	she	259	" I have none . "
59664	59677	59502	59502	she	259	" Nor ever had , I suppose : do you remember them ? "
59678	59681	59502	59502	she	259	" No . "
59682	59702	59502	59502	she	259	" I thought not . And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that stile ? "
59703	59709	59502	59502	she	259	" For whom , sir ? "
59710	59745	59746	59746	I	0	" For the men in green : it was a proper moonlight evening for them . Did I break through one of your rings , that you spread that damned ice on the causeway ? "
59751	59764	59766	59766	I	0	" The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago , "
59776	59819	59766	59766	I	0	" And not even in Hay Lane , or the fields about it , could you find a trace of them . I do n't think either summer or harvest , or winter moon , will ever shine on their revels more . "
59842	59845	59847	59848	Mr. Rochester	251	" Well , "
59850	59868	59847	59848	Mr. Rochester	251	" if you disown parents , you must have some sort of kinsfolk : uncles and aunts ? "
59869	59878	59766	59766	I	0	" No ; none that I ever saw . "
59879	59884	59766	59766	I	0	" And your home ? "
59885	59890	59847	59848	Mr. Rochester	251	" I have none . "
59891	59900	59766	59766	I	0	" Where do your brothers and sisters live ? "
59901	59909	59766	59766	I	0	" I have no brothers or sisters . "
59910	59918	59847	59848	Mr. Rochester	251	" Who recommended you to come here ? "
59919	59930	59766	59766	I	0	" I advertised , and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement . "
59931	59934	59936	59938	the good lady	1411	" Yes , "
59949	59983	59936	59938	the good lady	1411	" and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make . Miss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me , and a kind and careful teacher to Adele . "
59984	59995	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" Do n't trouble yourself to give her a character , "
60000	60020	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" eulogiums will not bias me ; I shall judge for myself . She began by felling my horse . "
60021	60024	60026	60027	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Sir ? "
60029	60039	60026	60027	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" I have to thank her for this sprain . "
60045	60057	60040	60041	The widow	1549	" Miss Eyre , have you ever lived in a town ? "
60058	60063	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" No , sir . "
60064	60071	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" Have you seen much society ? "
60072	60089	60040	60041	The widow	1549	" None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood , and now the inmates of Thornfield . "
60090	60096	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" Have you read much ? "
60097	60117	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" Only such books as came in my way ; and they have not been numerous or very learned . "
60118	60155	60040	60041	The widow	1549	" You have lived the life of a nun : no doubt you are well drilled in religious forms ; - Brocklehurst , who I understand directs Lowood , is a parson , is he not ? "
60156	60161	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" Yes , sir . "
60162	60181	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" And you girls probably worshipped him , as a convent full of religieuses would worship their director . "
60182	60187	60040	60041	The widow	1549	" Oh , no . "
60188	60209	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" You are very cool ! No ! What ! a novice not worship her priest ! That sounds blasphemous . "
60210	60262	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst ; and I was not alone in the feeling . He is a harsh man ; at once pompous and meddling ; he cut off our hair ; and for economy 's sake bought us bad needles and thread , with which we could hardly sew . "
60263	60270	60272	60273	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" That was very false economy , "
60285	60297	60299	60300	Mr. Rochester	251	" And was that the head and front of his offending ? "
60302	60360	60299	60300	Mr. Rochester	251	" He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision department , before the committee was appointed ; and he bored us with long lectures once a week , and with evening readings from books of his own inditing , about sudden deaths and judgments , which made us afraid to go to bed . "
60361	60372	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" What age were you when you went to Lowood ? "
60373	60377	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" About ten . "
60378	60394	60395	60395	I	0	" And you stayed there eight years : you are now , then , eighteen ? "
60398	60457	60395	60395	I	0	" Arithmetic , you see , is useful ; without its aid , I should hardly have been able to guess your age . It is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case . And now what did you learn at Lowood ? Can you play ? "
60458	60462	59997	59998	Mr. Rochester	251	" A little . "
60463	60551	60552	60552	I	0	" Of course : that is the established answer . Go into the library - I mean , if you please . - Excuse my tone of command ; I am used to say , ' Do this , ' and it is done : I can not alter my customary habits for one new inmate . - Go , then , into the library ; take a candle with you ; leave the door open ; sit down to the piano , and play a tune . "
60559	60562	60563	60563	he	1720	" Enough ! "
60571	60598	60599	60599	I	0	" You play A LITTLE , I see ; like any other English school - girl ; perhaps rather better than some , but not well . "
60610	60643	60606	60607	Mr. Rochester	251	" Adele showed me some sketches this morning , which she said were yours . I do n't know whether they were entirely of your doing ; probably a master aided you ? "
60644	60649	60650	60650	I	0	" No , indeed ! "
60653	60693	60650	60650	I	0	" Ah ! that pricks pride . Well , fetch me your portfolio , if you can vouch for its contents being original ; but do n't pass your word unless you are certain : I can recognise patchwork . "
60694	60710	60711	60711	I	0	" Then I will say nothing , and you shall judge for yourself , sir . "
60719	60724	60726	60726	he	1722	" Approach the table , "
60747	60751	60753	60754	Mr. Rochester	251	" No crowding , "
60756	60779	60780	60780	He	1722	" take the drawings from my hand as I finish with them ; but do n't push your faces up to mine . "
60807	60819	60821	60821	he	1722	" Take them off to the other table , Mrs. Fairfax , "
60823	60833	60821	60821	he	1722	" and look at them with Adele ; - you "
60837	60862	60802	60802	he	1722	" resume your seat , and answer my questions . I perceive those pictures were done by one hand : was that hand yours ? "
60863	60866	60802	60802	he	1722	" Yes . "
60867	60888	60802	60802	he	1722	" And when did you find time to do them ? They have taken much time , and some thought . "
60889	60910	60802	60802	he	1722	" I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood , when I had no other occupation . "
60911	60919	60802	60802	he	1722	" Where did you get your copies ? "
60920	60926	60802	60802	he	1722	" Out of my head . "
60927	60937	60802	60802	he	1722	" That head I see now on your shoulders ? "
60938	60943	60802	60802	he	1722	" Yes , sir . "
60944	60955	60802	60802	he	1722	" Has it other furniture of the same kind within ? "
60956	60970	60971	60971	He	0	" I should think it may have : I should hope - better . "
61518	61526	61901	61901	he	1732	" the likeness of a kingly crown ; "
61531	61539	61901	61901	he	1732	" the shape which shape had none . "
61540	61550	61552	61553	Mr. Rochester	251	" Were you happy when you painted these pictures ? "
61556	61590	61552	61553	Mr. Rochester	251	" I was absorbed , sir : yes , and I was happy . To paint them , in short , was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known . "
61591	61641	61901	61901	he	1732	" That is not saying much . Your pleasures , by your own account , have been few ; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist 's dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints . Did you sit at them long each day ? "
61642	61684	61552	61553	Mr. Rochester	251	" I had nothing else to do , because it was the vacation , and I sat at them from morning till noon , and from noon till night : the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply . "
61685	61700	61552	61553	Mr. Rochester	251	" And you felt self - satisfied with the result of your ardent labours ? "
61701	61734	61901	61901	he	1732	" Far from it . I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork : in each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise . "
61735	61883	61552	61553	Mr. Rochester	251	" Not quite : you have secured the shadow of your thought ; but no more , probably . You had not enough of the artist 's skill and science to give it full being : yet the drawings are , for a school - girl , peculiar . As to the thoughts , they are elfish . These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream . How could you make them look so clear , and yet not at all brilliant ? for the planet above quells their rays . And what meaning is that in their solemn depth ? And who taught you to paint wind ? There is a high gale in that sky , and on this hill - top . Where did you see Latmos ? For that is Latmos . There ! put the drawings away ! "
61905	61932	61901	61901	he	1732	" It is nine o'clock : what are you about , Miss Eyre , to let Adele sit up so long ? Take her to bed . "
61965	61976	61978	61978	he	1732	" I wish you all good - night , now , "
62034	62047	62048	62048	I	0	" You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar , Mrs. Fairfax , "
62065	62071	62048	62048	I	0	" Well , is he ? "
62072	62084	62056	62056	her	180	" I think so : he is very changeful and abrupt . "
62085	62128	62048	62048	I	0	" True : no doubt he may appear so to a stranger , but I am so accustomed to his manner , I never think of it ; and then , if he has peculiarities of temper , allowance should be made . "
62129	62132	62048	62048	I	0	" Why ? "
62133	62172	62056	62056	her	180	" Partly because it is his nature - and we can none of us help our nature ; and partly because he has painful thoughts , no doubt , to harass him , and make his spirits unequal . "
62173	62177	62048	62048	I	0	" What about ? "
62178	62186	62048	62048	I	0	" Family troubles , for one thing . "
62187	62194	62056	62056	her	180	" But he has no family . "
62195	62221	62048	62048	I	0	" Not now , but he has had - or , at least , relatives . He lost his elder brother a few years since . "
62222	62227	62048	62048	I	0	" His ELDER brother ? "
62228	62251	62056	62056	her	180	" Yes . The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the property ; only about nine years . "
62252	62277	62048	62048	I	0	" Nine years is a tolerable time . Was he so very fond of his brother as to be still inconsolable for his loss ? "
62278	62517	62048	62048	I	0	" Why , no - perhaps not . I believe there were some misunderstandings between them . Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward ; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him . The old gentleman was fond of money , and anxious to keep the family estate together . He did not like to diminish the property by division , and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth , too , to keep up the consequence of the name ; and , soon after he was of age , some steps were taken that were not quite fair , and made a great deal of mischief . Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position , for the sake of making his fortune : what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew , but his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it . He is not very forgiving : he broke with his family , and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life . I do n't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together , since the death of his brother without a will left him master of the estate ; and , indeed , no wonder he shuns the old place . "
62518	62525	62056	62056	her	180	" Why should he shun it ? "
62526	62533	62048	62048	I	0	" Perhaps he thinks it gloomy . "
62987	62994	62996	62996	she	259	" Ma boite ! ma boite ! "
63002	63033	63042	63043	Mr. Rochester	251	" Yes , there is your ' boite ' at last : take it into a corner , you genuine daughter of Paris , and amuse yourself with disembowelling it , "
63059	63063	63064	63064	he	251	" And mind , "
63067	63109	63064	63064	he	251	" do n't bother me with any details of the anatomical process , or any notice of the condition of the entrails : let your operation be conducted in silence : tiens - toi tranquille , enfant ; comprends - tu ? "
63158	63166	63154	63154	she	259	" Oh ciel ! Que c'est beau ! "
63175	63181	63184	63185	the master	540	" Is Miss Eyre there ? "
63205	63217	63218	63218	He	540	" Ah ! well , come forward ; be seated here . "
63226	63237	63238	63238	he	540	" I am not fond of the prattle of children , "
63241	63368	63238	63238	he	540	" for , old bachelor as I am , I have no pleasant associations connected with their lisp . It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening tete - e - tete with a brat . Do n't draw that chair farther off , Miss Eyre ; sit down exactly where I placed it - if you please , that is . Confound these civilities ! I continually forget them . Nor do I particularly affect simple - minded old ladies . By - the - bye , I must have mine in mind ; it wo n't do to neglect her ; she is a Fairfax , or we d to one ; and blood is said to be thicker than water . "
63390	63448	63377	63378	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Good evening , madam ; I sent to you for a charitable purpose . I have forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents , and she is bursting with repletion : have the goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice ; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed . "
63485	63488	63460	63460	she	180	" boite ; "
63507	63519	63521	63522	Mr. Rochester	251	" Now I have performed the part of a good host , "
63524	63590	63591	63591	I	0	" put my guests into the way of amusing each other , I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure . Miss Eyre , draw your chair still a little farther forward : you are yet too far back ; I can not see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair , which I have no mind to do . "
63941	63949	63951	63951	he	251	" You examine me , Miss Eyre , "
63953	63960	63951	63951	he	251	" do you think me handsome ? "
63994	63999	63990	63990	I	0	" No , sir . "
64000	64014	64016	64016	he	251	" Ah ! By my word ! there is something singular about you , "
64018	64123	64016	64016	he	251	" you have the air of a little nonnette ; quaint , quiet , grave , and simple , as you sit with your hands before you , and your eyes generally bent on the carpet except , by - the - bye , when they are directed piercingly to my face ; as just now , for instance ; and when one asks you a question , or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply , you rap out a round rejoinder , which , if not blunt , is at least brusque . What do you mean by it ? "
64124	64177	63990	63990	I	0	" Sir , I was too plain ; I beg your pardon . I ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances ; that tastes mostly differ ; and that beauty is of little consequence , or something of that sort . "
64178	64252	63990	63990	I	0	" You ought to have replied no such thing . Beauty of little consequence , indeed ! And so , under pretence of softening the previous outrage , of stroking and soothing me into placidity , you stick a sly penknife under my ear ! Go on : what fault do you find with me , pray ? I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features like any other man ? "
64253	64277	64016	64016	he	251	" Mr. Rochester , allow me to disown my first answer : I intended no pointed repartee : it was only a blunder . "
64278	64304	64305	64305	He	1753	" Just so : I think so : and you shall be answerable for it . Criticise me : does my forehead not please you ? "
64344	64354	64305	64305	He	1753	" Now , ma'am , am I a fool ? "
64355	64381	64016	64016	he	251	" Far from it , sir . You would , perhaps , think me rude if I inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist ? "
64382	64441	64443	64443	he	1753	" There again ! Another stick of the penknife , when she pretended to pat my head : and that is because I said I did not like the society of children and old women low be it spoken ! . No , young lady , I am not a general philanthropist ; but I bear a conscience ; "
64482	64589	64443	64443	he	1753	" and , besides , I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart . When I was as old as you , I was a feeling fellow enough , partial to the unfledged , unfostered , and unlucky ; but Fortune has knocked me about since : she has even kneaded me with her knuckles , and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India - rubber ball ; pervious , though , through a chink or two still , and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump . Yes : does that leave hope for me ? "
64590	64597	64443	64443	he	1753	" Hope of what , sir ? "
64598	64613	64443	64443	he	1753	" Of my final re - transformation from India - rubber back to flesh ? "
64614	64623	64624	64624	I	0	" Decidedly he has had too much wine , "
64655	64734	64738	64738	he	1753	" You looked very much puzzled , Miss Eyre ; and though you are not pretty any more than I am handsome , yet a puzzled air becomes you ; besides , it is convenient , for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy , and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug ; so puzzle on . Young lady , I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to - night . "
64880	64893	64894	64894	he	1753	" I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to - night , "
64897	65031	64894	64894	he	1753	" and that is why I sent for you : the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for me ; nor would Pilot have been , for none of these can talk . Adele is a degree better , but still far below the mark ; Mrs. Fairfax ditto ; you , I am persuaded , can suit me if you will : you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here . I have almost forgotten you since : other ideas have driven yours from my head ; but to - night I am resolved to be at ease ; to dismiss what importunes , and recall what pleases . It would please me now to draw you out - to learn more of you - therefore speak . "
65049	65052	65053	65053	he	1757	" Speak , "
65056	65062	65053	65053	he	1757	" What about , sir ? "
65063	65085	65086	65086	Accordingly	275	" Whatever you like . I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of treating it entirely to yourself . "
65093	65122	65123	65123	I	0	" If he expects me to talk for the mere sake of talking and showing off , he will find he has addressed himself to the wrong person , "
65126	65134	65123	65123	I	0	" You are dumb , Miss Eyre . "
65162	65165	65166	65166	he	1757	" Stubborn ? "
65169	65220	65222	65222	himself	1757	" and annoyed . Ah ! it is consistent . I put my request in an absurd , almost insolent form . Miss Eyre , I beg your pardon . The fact is , once for all , I do n't wish to treat you like an inferior : that is "
65224	65310	65166	65166	he	1757	" I claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years ' difference in age and a century 's advance in experience . This is legitimate , et j'y tiens , as Adele would say ; and it is by virtue of this superiority , and this alone , that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now , and divert my thoughts , which are galled with dwelling on one point - cankering as a rusty nail . "
65337	65386	65322	65322	I	0	" I am willing to amuse you , if I can , sir - quite willing ; but I can not introduce a topic , because how do I know what will interest you ? Ask me questions , and I will do my best to answer them . "
65387	65473	65166	65166	he	1757	" Then , in the first place , do you agree with me that I have a right to be a little masterful , abrupt , perhaps exacting , sometimes , on the grounds I stated , namely , that I am old enough to be your father , and that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations , and roamed over half the globe , while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house ? "
65474	65482	65166	65166	he	1757	" Do as you please , sir . "
65483	65506	65322	65322	I	0	" That is no answer ; or rather it is a very irritating , because a very evasive one . Reply clearly . "
65507	65561	65166	65166	he	1757	" I do n't think , sir , you have a right to command me , merely because you are older than I , or because you have seen more of the world than I have ; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience . "
65562	65637	65638	65638	I	0	" Humph ! Promptly spoken . But I wo n't allow that , seeing that it would never suit my case , as I have made an indifferent , not to say a bad , use of both advantages . Leaving superiority out of the question , then , you must still agree to receive my orders now and then , without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command . Will you ? "
65667	65674	65676	65676	he	251	" The smile is very well , "
65684	65689	65676	65676	he	251	" but speak too . "
65690	65720	65645	65646	Mr. Rochester	251	" I was thinking , sir , that very few masters would trouble themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders . "
65721	65763	65676	65676	he	251	" Paid subordinates ! What ! you are my paid subordinate , are you ? Oh yes , I had forgotten the salary ! Well then , on that mercenary ground , will you agree to let me hector a little ? "
65764	65804	65676	65676	he	251	" No , sir , not on that ground ; but , on the ground that you did forget it , and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency , I agree heartily . "
65805	65830	65645	65646	Mr. Rochester	251	" And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms and phrases , without thinking that the omission arises from insolence ? "
65831	65866	65676	65676	he	251	" I am sure , sir , I should never mistake informality for insolence : one I rather like , the other nothing free - born would submit to , even for a salary . "
65867	66077	65676	65676	he	251	" Humbug ! Most things free - born will submit to anything for a salary ; therefore , keep to yourself , and do n't venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant . However , I mentally shake hands with you for your answer , despite its inaccuracy ; and as much for the manner in which it was said , as for the substance of the speech ; the manner was frank and sincere ; one does not often see such a manner : no , on the contrary , affectation , or coldness , or stupid , coarse - minded misapprehension of one 's meaning are the usual rewards of candour . Not three in three thousand raw school - girl - governesses would have answered me as you have just done . But I do n't mean to flatter you : if you are cast in a different mould to the majority , it is no merit of yours : Nature did it . And then , after all , I go too fast in my conclusions : for what I yet know , you may be no better than the rest ; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points . "
66078	66084	66085	66085	I	0	" And so may you , "
66119	66128	66130	66130	he	1758	" Yes , yes , you are right , "
66132	66319	66130	66130	he	1758	" I have plenty of faults of my own : I know it , and I do n't wish to palliate them , I assure you . God wot I need not be too severe about others ; I have a past existence , a series of deeds , a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast , which might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself . I started , or rather for like other defaulters , I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one - and- twenty , and have never recovered the right course since : but I might have been very different ; I might have been as good as you - wiser - almost as stainless . I envy you your peace of mind , your clean conscience , your unpolluted memory . Little girl , a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure - an inexhaustible source of pure refreshment : is it not ? "
66320	66332	66099	66099	he	1758	" How was your memory when you were eighteen , sir ? "
66333	66620	66099	66099	he	1758	" All right then ; limpid , salubrious : no gush of bilge water had turned it to fetid puddle . I was your equal at eighteen - quite your equal . Nature meant me to be , on the whole , a good man , Miss Eyre ; one of the better kind , and you see I am not so . You would say you do n't see it ; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye beware , by - the - bye , what you express with that organ ; I am quick at interpreting its language . Then take my word for it , - I am not a villain : you are not to suppose that - not to attribute to me any such bad eminence ; but , owing , I verily believe , rather to circumstances than to my natural bent , I am a trite commonplace sinner , hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life . Do you wonder that I avow this to you ? Know , that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances ' secrets : people will instinctively find out , as I have done , that it is not your forte to tell of yourself , but to listen while others talk of themselves ; they will feel , too , that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion , but with a kind of innate sympathy ; not the less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations . "
66621	66637	66130	66130	he	1758	" How do you know ? - how can you guess all this , sir ? "
66638	66781	66099	66099	he	1758	" I know it well ; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary . You would say , I should have been superior to circumstances ; so I should - so I should ; but you see I was not . When fate wronged me , I had not the wisdom to remain cool : I turned desperate ; then I degenerated . Now , when any vicious simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry , I can not flatter myself that I am better than he : I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level . I wish I had stood firm - God knows I do ! Dread remorse when you are tempted to err , Miss Eyre ; remorse is the poison of life . "
66782	66793	66099	66099	he	1758	" Repentance is said to be its cure , sir . "
66794	66871	66130	66130	he	1758	" It is not its cure . Reformation may be its cure ; and I could reform - I have strength yet for that - if - but where is the use of thinking of it , hampered , burdened , cursed as I am ? Besides , since happiness is irrevocably denied me , I have a right to get pleasure out of life : and I WILL get it , cost what it may . "
66872	66882	66099	66099	he	1758	" Then you will degenerate still more , sir . "
66883	66920	66099	66099	he	1758	" Possibly : yet why should I , if I can get sweet , fresh pleasure ? And I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the moor . "
66921	66933	66130	66130	he	1758	" It will sting - it will taste bitter , sir . "
66934	66968	66099	66099	he	1758	" How do you know ? - you never tried it . How very serious - how very solemn you look : and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head "
66975	67005	66099	66099	he	1758	" You have no right to preach to me , you neophyte , that have not passed the porch of life , and are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries . "
67006	67033	66099	66099	he	1758	" I only remind you of your own words , sir : you said error brought remorse , and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence . "
67034	67127	66099	66099	he	1758	" And who talks of error now ? I scarcely think the notion that flittered across my brain was an error . I believe it was an inspiration rather than a temptation : it was very genial , very soothing - I know that . Here it comes again ! It is no devil , I assure you ; or if it be , it has put on the robes of an angel of light . I think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart . "
67128	67141	66099	66099	he	1758	" Distrust it , sir ; it is not a true angel . "
67142	67181	66099	66099	he	1758	" Once more , how do you know ? By what instinct do you pretend to distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the eternal throne - between a guide and a seducer ? "
67182	67219	66099	66099	he	1758	" I judged by your countenance , sir , which was troubled when you said the suggestion had returned upon you . I feel sure it will work you more misery if you listen to it . "
67220	67262	67263	67263	He	1759	" Not at all - it bears the most gracious message in the world : for the rest , you are not my conscience - keeper , so do n't make yourself uneasy . Here , come in , bonny wanderer ! "
67309	67312	67313	67313	he	1759	" Now , "
67320	67358	67313	67313	he	1759	" I have received the pilgrim - a disguised deity , as I verily believe . Already it has done me good : my heart was a sort of charnel ; it will now be a shrine . "
67359	67508	67298	67298	he	1759	" To speak truth , sir , I do n't understand you at all : I can not keep up the conversation , because it has got out of my depth . Only one thing , I know : you said you were not as good as you should like to be , and that you regretted your own imperfection ; - one thing I can comprehend : you intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane . It seems to me , that if you tried hard , you would in time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve ; and that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions , you would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections , to which you might revert with pleasure . "
67509	67532	67298	67298	he	1759	" Justly thought ; rightly said , Miss Eyre ; and , at this moment , I am paving hell with energy . "
67533	67536	67313	67313	he	1759	" Sir ? "
67537	67566	67313	67313	he	1759	" I am laying down good intentions , which I believe durable as flint . Certainly , my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have been . "
67567	67571	67298	67298	he	1759	" And better ? "
67572	67634	67298	67298	he	1759	" And better - so much better as pure ore is than foul dross . You seem to doubt me ; I do n't doubt myself : I know what my aim is , what my motives are ; and at this moment I pass a law , unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians , that both are right . "
67635	67653	67313	67313	he	1759	" They can not be , sir , if they require a new statute to legalise them . "
67654	67681	67313	67313	he	1759	" They are , Miss Eyre , though they absolutely require a new statute : unheard - of combinations of circumstances demand unheard - of rules . "
67682	67704	67298	67298	he	1759	" That sounds a dangerous maxim , sir ; because one can see at once that it is liable to abuse . "
67705	67725	67298	67298	he	1759	" Sententious sage ! so it is : but I swear by my household gods not to abuse it . "
67726	67733	67313	67313	he	1759	" You are human and fallible . "
67734	67745	67298	67298	he	1759	" I am : so are you - what then ? "
67746	67768	67298	67298	he	1759	" The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted . "
67769	67773	67313	67313	he	1759	" What power ? "
67774	67795	67298	67298	he	1759	" That of saying of any strange , unsanctioned line of action , - ' Let it be right . ' "
67796	67813	67298	67298	he	1759	" ' Let it be right ' - the very words : you have pronounced them . "
67814	67821	67822	67822	I	0	" MAY it be right then , "
67885	67891	68460	68460	She	259	" Where are you going ? "
67892	67905	68460	68460	She	259	" To put Adele to bed : it is past her bedtime . "
67906	67920	68460	68460	She	259	" You are afraid of me , because I talk like a Sphynx . "
67921	67941	68460	68460	She	259	" Your language is enigmatical , sir : but though I am bewildered , I am certainly not afraid . "
67942	67955	68460	68460	She	259	" You ARE afraid - your self - love dreads a blunder . "
67956	67973	68460	68460	She	259	" In that sense I do feel apprehensive - I have no wish to talk nonsense . "
67974	68198	68460	68460	She	259	" If you did , it would be in such a grave , quiet manner , I should mistake it for sense . Do you never laugh , Miss Eyre ? Do n't trouble yourself to answer - I see you laugh rarely ; but you can laugh very merrily : believe me , you are not naturally austere , any more than I am naturally vicious . The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat ; controlling your features , muffling your voice , and restricting your limbs ; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother - or father , or master , or what you will - to smile too gaily , speak too freely , or move too quickly : but , in time , I think you will learn to be natural with me , as I find it impossible to be conventional with you ; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now . I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close - set bars of a cage : a vivid , restless , resolute captive is there ; were it but free , it would soar cloud - high . You are still bent on going ? "
68199	68207	68460	68460	She	259	" It has struck nine , sir . "
68208	68445	68460	68460	She	259	" Never mind , - wait a minute : Adele is not ready to go to bed yet . My position , Miss Eyre , with my back to the fire , and my face to the room , favours observation . While talking to you , I have also occasionally watched Adele I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study , - reasons that I may , nay , that I shall , impart to you some day . She pulled out of her box , about ten minutes ago , a little pink silk frock ; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it ; coquetry runs in her blood , blends with her brains , and seasons the marrow of her bones . ' Il faut que je l'essaie ! ' cried she , ' et e l'instant meme ! ' and she rushed out of the room . She is now with Sophie , undergoing a robing process : in a few minutes she will re - enter ; and I know what I shall see , - a miniature of Celine Varens , as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of - But never mind that . However , my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock : such is my presentiment ; stay now , to see whether it will be realised . "
68523	68533	68535	68535	she	259	" Est - ce que ma robe va bien ? "
68540	68558	68535	68535	she	259	" et mes souliers ? et mes bas ? Tenez , je crois que je vais danser ! "
68599	68611	68577	68577	she	259	" Monsieur , je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte ; "
68618	68633	68615	68615	she	259	" C'est comme cela que maman faisait , n'est - ce pas , monsieur ? "
68634	68641	68615	68615	she	259	" Pre - cise - ly ! "
68646	68811	68615	68615	she	259	" and , ' comme cela , ' she charmed my English gold out of my British breeches ' pocket . I have been green , too , Miss Eyre , - ay , grass green : not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me . My Spring is gone , however , but it has left me that French floweret on my hands , which , in some moods , I would fain be rid of . Not valuing now the root whence it sprang ; having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure , I have but half a liking to the blossom , especially when it looks so artificial as just now . I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins , great or small , by one good work . I 'll explain all this some day . Good - night . "

68949	69245	69266	69266	his	1770	" And , Miss Eyre , so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph for her British gnome , that I installed her in an hotel ; gave her a complete establishment of servants , a carriage , cashmeres , diamonds , dentelles , c. In short , I began the process of ruining myself in the received style , like any other spoony . I had not , it seems , the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction , but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre . I had - as I deserved to have - the fate of all other spoonies . Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me , I found her out ; but it was a warm night , and I was tired with strolling through Paris , so I sat down in her boudoir ; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence . No , - I exaggerate ; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her : it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left ; a scent of musk and amber , than an odour of sanctity . I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences , when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony . It was moonlight and gaslight besides , and very still and serene . The balcony was furnished with a chair or two ; I sat down , and took out a cigar , - I will take one now , if you will excuse me . "
69286	69541	69282	69282	he	1770	" I liked bonbons too in those days , Miss Eyre , and I was croquant - overlook the barbarism - croquant chocolate comfits , and smoking alternately , watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera - house , when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses , and distinctly seen in the brilliant city - night , I recognised the ' voiture ' I had given Celine . She was returning : of course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon . The carriage stopped , as I had expected , at the hotel door ; my flame that is the very word for an opera inamorata alighted : though muffed in a cloak - an unnecessary encumbrance , by - the - bye , on so warm a June evening - I knew her instantly by her little foot , seen peeping from the skirt of her dress , as she skipped from the carriage - step . Bending over the balcony , I was about to murmur ' Mon ange ' - in a tone , of course , which should be audible to the ear of love alone - when a figure jumped from the carriage after her ; cloaked also ; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement , and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched porte cochere of the hotel . "
69725	69813	69814	69814	He	0	" I like this day ; I like that sky of steel ; I like the sternness and stillness of the world under this frost . I like Thornfield , its antiquity , its retirement , its old crow - trees and thorn - trees , its grey facade , and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin : and yet how long have I abhorred the very thought of it , shunned it like a great plague - house ? How I do still abhor - "
69965	70069	69961	69961	he	0	" During the moment I was silent , Miss Eyre , I was arranging a point with my destiny . She stood there , by that beech - trunk - a hag like one of those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres . ' You like Thornfield ? ' she said , lifting her finger ; and then she wrote in the air a memento , which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house - front , between the upper and lower row of windows , ' Like it if you can ! Like it if you dare ! ' "

70175	70180	70192	70192	Sophie	256	" he cried harshly ; "
70194	70218	70192	70192	Sophie	256	" Continuing then to pursue his walk in silence , I ventured to recall him to the point whence he had abruptly diverged - "
70227	70231	70220	70220	you	0	" I asked , "
70238	70282	70235	70235	Varens	281	" I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well - timed question , but , on the contrary , waking out of his scowling abstraction , he turned his eyes towards me , and the shade seemed to clear off his brow . "
70351	70362	70365	70365	I	0	" he exclaimed , suddenly starting again from the point . "
70542	70549	70550	70550	I	0	" After this digression he proceeded - "
70822	70975	70976	70976	Adele	259	" They began to talk ; their conversation eased me completely : frivolous , mercenary , heartless , and senseless , it was rather calculated to weary than enrage a listener . A card of mine lay on the table ; this being perceived , brought my name under discussion . Neither of them possessed energy or wit to belabour me soundly , but they insulted me as coarsely as they could in their little way : especially Celine , who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal defects - deformities she termed them . Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she called my ' beaute male : ' wherein she differed diametrically from you , who told me point - blank , at the second interview , that you did not think me handsome . The contrast struck me at the time and - "
70983	71003	70976	70976	Adele	259	" Monsieur , John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to see you . "
71004	71333	70976	70976	Adele	259	" Ah ! in that case I must abridge . Opening the window , I walked in upon them ; liberated Celine from my protection ; gave her notice to vacate her hotel ; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies ; disregarded screams , hysterics , prayers , protestations , convulsions ; made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne . Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him ; left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms , feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip , and then thought I had done with the whole crew . But unluckily the Varens , six months before , had given me this filette Adele , who , she affirmed , was my daughter ; and perhaps she may be , though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance : Pilot is more like me than she . Some years after I had broken with the mother , she abandoned her child , and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer . I acknowledged no natural claim on Adele 's part to be supported by me , nor do I now acknowledge any , for I am not her father ; but hearing that she was quite destitute , I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris , and transplanted it here , to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden . Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it ; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera- girl , you will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee : you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place - that you beg me to look out for a new governess , c. - Eh ? "
71334	71427	71481	71483	battledore and shuttlecock	1808	" No : Adele is not answerable for either her mother 's faults or yours : I have a regard for her ; and now that I know she is , in a sense , parentless - forsaken by her mother and disowned by you , sir - I shall cling closer to her than before . How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family , who would hate her governess as a nuisance , to a lonely little orphan , who leans towards her as a friend ? "
71428	71456	71458	71458	I	0	" Oh , that is the light in which you view it ! Well , I must go in now ; and you too : it darkens . "

72490	72561	72486	72486	I	0	" What alienates him from the house ? Will he leave it again soon ? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at a time ; and he has now been resident eight weeks . If he does go , the change will be doleful . Suppose he should be absent spring , summer , and autumn : how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem ! "

If you are not warm enough , you may take my cloak yonder ; wrap it about you , and sit down in the arm - chair : there , - I will put it on . Now place your feet on the stool , to keep them out of the wet . I am going to leave you a few minutes . I shall take the candle . Remain where you are till I return ; be as still as a mouse . I must pay a visit to the second storey . Do n't move , remember , or call any one . "

74158	74170	74133	74133	he	1846	" No , sir , only the candlestick on the ground . "
74171	74195	74085	74085	he	1846	" But you heard an odd laugh ? You have heard that laugh before , I should think , or something like it ? "
74196	74226	74085	74085	he	1846	" Yes , sir : there is a woman who sews here , called Grace Poole , - she laughs in that way . She is a singular person . "
74227	74305	74133	74133	he	1846	" Just so . Grace Poole - you have guessed it . She is , as you say , singular - very . Well , I shall reflect on the subject . Meantime , I am glad that you are the only person , besides myself , acquainted with the precise details of to - night 's incident . You are no talking fool : say nothing about it . I will account for this state of affairs "
74311	74351	74133	74133	he	1846	" and now return to your own room . I shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night . It is near four:- in two hours the servants will be up . "
74352	74361	74363	74363	I	0	" Good - night , then , sir , "
74384	74387	74388	74388	he	1850	" What ! "
74391	74403	74388	74388	he	1850	" are you quitting me already , and in that way ? "
74404	74413	74376	74376	he	1850	" You said I might go , sir . "
74414	74481	74482	74482	He	1850	" But not without taking leave ; not without a word or two of acknowledgment and good - will : not , in short , in that brief , dry fashion . Why , you have saved my life ! - snatched me from a horrible and excruciating death ! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers ! At least shake hands . "
74506	74569	74570	74570	He	1850	" You have saved my life : I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt . I can not say more . Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation : but you : it is different ; - I feel your benefits no burden , Jane . "
74590	74613	74585	74585	his	1850	" Good - night again , sir . There is no debt , benefit , burden , obligation , in the case . "
74614	74618	74619	74619	he	1850	" I knew , "
74622	74655	74658	74658	he	1850	" you would do me good in some way , at some time ; - I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you : their expression and smile did not "
74661	74664	74665	74665	he	1850	" did not "
74709	74723	74724	74724	I	0	" Strange energy was in his voice , strange fire in his look . "
74733	74743	74724	74724	I	0	" I said : and then I was going . "
74750	74751	74746	74746	you	1850	" "
74758	74759	74752	74752	I	0	" "
74779	74801	74802	74802	I	0	" But he still retained my hand , and I could not free it . I bethought myself of an expedient . "
74812	74815	74806	74807	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" said I. "
74821	75110	74819	74819	me	0	" he relaxed his fingers , and I was gone . I regained my couch , but never thought of sleep . Till morning dawned I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea , where billows of trouble rolled under surges of joy . I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore , sweet as the hills of Beulah ; and now and then a freshening gale , wakened by hope , bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne : but I could not reach it , even in fancy - a counteracting breeze blew off land , and continually drove me back . Sense would resist delirium : judgment would warn passion . Too feverish to rest , I rose as soon as day dawned . CHAPTER XVI I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless night : I wanted to hear his voice again , yet feared to meet his eye . During the early part of the morning , I momentarily expected his coming ; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom , but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes , and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it that day . But the morning passed just as usual : nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Adele 's studies ; only soon after breakfast , I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester 's chamber , Mrs. Fairfax 's voice , and Leah 's , and the cook 's - that is , John 's wife - and even John 's own gruff tones . There were exclamations of "
75122	75123	74806	74807	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" "
75136	75137	75141	75141	he	1857	" "
75154	75155	75141	75141	he	1857	" "
75162	75163	75158	75158	he	1857	" "
75181	75460	75169	75169	he	1857	" c. To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights ; and when I passed the room , in going downstairs to dinner , I saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete order ; only the bed was stripped of its hangings . Leah stood up in the window - seat , rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke . I was about to address her , for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair : but , on advancing , I saw a second person in the chamber - a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside , and sewing rings to new curtains . That woman was no other than Grace Poole . There she sat , staid and taciturn - looking , as usual , in her brown stuff gown , her check apron , white handkerchief , and cap . She was intent on her work , in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed : on her hard forehead , and in her commonplace features , was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder , and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair , and as I believed , charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate . I was amazed - confounded . She looked up , while I still gazed at her : no start , no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion , consciousness of guilt , or fear of detection . She said "
75466	75490	75464	75464	Miss	1859	" in her usual phlegmatic and brief manner ; and taking up another ring and more tape , went on with her sewing . "
75499	75511	75491	75491	I	0	" thought I : ' such absolute impenetrability is past comprehension . "
75512	75518	75519	75519	I	0	" Good morning , Grace , "
75522	75541	75519	75519	I	0	" Has anything happened here ? I thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago . "
75542	75600	75491	75491	I	0	" Only master had been reading in his bed last night ; he fell asleep with his candle lit , and the curtains got on fire ; but , fortunately , he awoke before the bed - clothes or the wood - work caught , and contrived to quench the flames with the water in the ewer . "
75601	75606	75607	75607	I	0	" A strange affair ! "
75622	75636	75637	75637	She	1860	" Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody ? Did no one hear him move ? "
75668	75720	75665	75665	she	1860	" The servants sleep so far off , you know , Miss , they would not be likely to hear . Mrs. Fairfax 's room and yours are the nearest to master 's ; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing : when people get elderly , they often sleep heavy . "
75744	75768	75721	75721	She	1860	" But you are young , Miss ; and I should say a light sleeper : perhaps you may have heard a noise ? "
75769	75773	75775	75775	I	0	" I did , "
75797	75827	75828	75828	She	1860	" and at first I thought it was Pilot : but Pilot can not laugh ; and I am certain I heard a laugh , and a strange one . "
75856	75884	75841	75841	her	1860	" It is hardly likely master would laugh , I should think , Miss , when he was in such danger : You must have been dreaming . "
75885	75891	75892	75892	I	0	" I was not dreaming , "
75921	75932	75933	75933	she	1860	" Have you told master that you heard a laugh ? "
75936	75950	75933	75933	she	1860	" I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning . "
75951	75967	75968	75968	she	1860	" You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery ? "
76027	76032	76034	76034	I	0	" On the contrary , "
76036	76042	76034	76034	I	0	" I bolted my door . "
76043	76063	76004	76004	she	1860	" Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed ? "
76064	76082	76034	76034	I	0	" Fiend ! she wants to know my habits , that she may lay her plans accordingly ! "
76093	76130	76089	76089	I	0	" Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt : I did not think it necessary . I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall : but in future "
76139	76156	76132	76132	I	0	" I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to lie down . "
76157	76166	76168	76168	her	1862	" It will be wise so to do , "
76171	76335	76168	76168	her	1862	" this neighbourhood is as quiet as any I know , and I never heard of the hall being attempted by robbers since it was a house ; though there are hundreds of pounds ' worth of plate in the plate - closet , as is well known . And you see , for such a large house , there are very few servants , because master has never lived here much ; and when he does come , being a bachelor , he needs little waiting on : but I always think it best to err on the safe side ; a door is soon fastened , and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about . A deal of people , Miss , are for trusting all to Providence ; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means , though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly . "
76383	76387	76389	76389	she	5434	" Mrs. Poole , "
76394	76409	76389	76389	she	5434	" the servants ' dinner will soon be ready : will you come down ? "
76410	76434	76379	76380	the cook	5434	" No ; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray , and I 'll carry it upstairs . "
76435	76442	76379	76380	the cook	5434	" You 'll have some meat ? "
76443	76458	76389	76389	she	5434	" Just a morsel , and a taste of cheese , that 's all . "
76459	76464	76379	76380	the cook	5434	" And the sago ? "
76465	76486	76487	76488	The cook	5434	" Never mind it at present : I shall be coming down before teatime : I 'll make it myself . "
76718	76721	76722	76722	I	0	" Yet , "
76862	76902	76833	76833	she	263	" But , having reached this point of conjecture , Mrs. Poole 's square , flat figure , and uncomely , dry , even coarse face , recurred so distinctly to my mind 's eye , that I thought , "
76916	76930	76939	76940	Mr. Rochester	251	" suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts , "
76973	77021	76970	76970	his	251	" I well remembered all ; language , glance , and tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed . I was now in the schoolroom ; Adele was drawing ; I bent over her and directed her pencil . She looked up with a sort of start . "
77030	77034	76970	76970	his	251	" said she . "
77055	77056	77057	77057	I	0	" "
77066	77168	77061	77061	Adele	259	" She went on sketching ; I went on thinking . I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving respecting Grace Poole ; it disgusted me . I compared myself with her , and found we were different . Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady ; and she spoke truth - I was a lady . And now I looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me ; I had more colour and more flesh , more life , more vivacity , because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments . "
77172	77183	77061	77061	Adele	259	" said I , as I looked towards the window . "
77236	77571	77572	77572	You	1877	" When dusk actually closed , and when Adele left me to go and play in the nursery with Sophie , I did most keenly desire it . I listened for the bell to ring below ; I listened for Leah coming up with a message ; I fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester 's own tread , and I turned to the door , expecting it to open and admit him . The door remained shut ; darkness only came in through the window . Still it was not late ; he often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock , and it was yet but six . Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to- night , when I had so many things to say to him ! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace Poole , and to hear what he would answer ; I wanted to ask him plainly if he really believed it was she who had made last night 's hideous attempt ; and if so , why he kept her wickedness a secret . It little mattered whether my curiosity irritated him ; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by turns ; it was one I chiefly delighted in , and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far ; beyond the verge of provocation I never ventured ; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill . Retaining every minute form of respect , every propriety of my station , I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy restraint ; this suited both him and me . A tread creaked on the stairs at last . Leah made her appearance ; but it was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax 's room . Thither I repaired , glad at least to go downstairs ; for that brought me , I imagined , nearer to Mr. Rochester 's presence . "
77578	77589	77572	77572	You	1877	" said the good lady , as I joined her ; "
77601	77605	77597	77597	I	0	" she continued , "
77620	77621	77614	77614	you	1877	" "

77657	77701	77646	77646	you	1877	" Having completed her task , she rose to draw down the blind , which she had hitherto kept up , by way , I suppose , of making the most of daylight , though dusk was now fast deepening into total obscurity . "
77709	77720	77646	77646	you	1877	" said she , as she looked through the panes , "
77741	77742	77725	77726	Mr. Rochester	251	" "
77760	77761	77764	77764	he	251	" "

78094	78095	78096	78096	You	1892	" "
78111	78112	78117	78117	her	297	" "
78215	78216	78208	78209	Miss Ingram	297	" "
78223	78224	78220	78220	she	297	" "
78368	78369	78370	78370	She	297	" "
78378	78379	78370	78370	She	297	" "

78466	78467	78468	78473	A very rich and powerful one	1911	" "
78517	78518	78509	78509	him	251	" "
78532	78533	78526	78526	she	297	" "
78569	78570	78560	78562	the eldest son	1916	" "
78600	78601	78597	78597	he	251	" "

78696	78904	78905	78905	YOU	1919	" I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr. Rochester and the beautiful Blanche ; but Adele came in , and the conversation was turned into another channel . When once more alone , I reviewed the information I had got ; looked into my heart , examined its thoughts and feelings , and endeavoured to bring back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination 's boundless and trackless waste , into the safe fold of common sense . Arraigned at my own bar , Memory having given her evidence of the hopes , wishes , sentiments I had been cherishing since last night - of the general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past ; Reason having come forward and told , in her own quiet way a plain , unvarnished tale , showing how I had rejected the real , and rabidly devoured the ideal ; - I pronounced judgment to this effect:- That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life ; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies , and swallowed poison as if it were nectar . "
78907	78911	78905	78905	YOU	1919	" I said , "
79121	79185	79195	79195	you	1919	" Listen , then , Jane Eyre , to your sentence : tomorrow , place the glass before you , and draw in chalk your own picture , faithfully , without softening one defect ; omit no harsh line , smooth away no displeasing irregularity ; write under it , ' Portrait of a Governess , disconnected , poor , and plain . ' "
79364	79430	79438	79438	I	0	" Whenever , in future , you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks well of you , take out these two pictures and compare them : say , ' Mr. Rochester might probably win that noble lady 's love , if he chose to strive for it ; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian ? ' "
79431	79437	79438	79438	I	0	" I 'll do it , "
79805	79939	79801	79801	I	0	" You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield , further than to receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee , and to be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as , if you do your duty , you have a right to expect at his hands . Be sure that is the only tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him ; so do n't make him the object of your fine feelings , your raptures , agonies , and so forth . He is not of your order : keep to your caste , and be too self - respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart , soul , and strength , where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised . "
80020	80027	80029	80029	she	295	" It is from the master , "
80038	80055	80029	80029	she	295	" Now I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not . "
80125	80154	80156	80157	Mrs. Fairfax	295	" Well , I sometimes think we are too quiet ; but we run a chance of being busy enough now : for a little while at least , "
80210	80223	80205	80205	I	0	" Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon , I suppose ? "
80224	80335	80205	80205	I	0	" Indeed he is - in three days , he says : that will be next Thursday ; and not alone either . I do n't know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with him : he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared ; and the library and drawing - rooms are to be cleaned out ; I am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn , at Millcote , and from wherever else I can ; and the ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets : so we shall have a full house of it .

81009	81012	81014	81014	Leah	195	" Yes , "
81016	81125	81014	81014	Leah	195	" I wish I had as good ; not that mine are to complain of , - there 's no stinginess at Thornfield ; but they 're not one fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives . And she is laying by : she goes every quarter to the bank at Millcote . I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave ; but I suppose she 's got used to the place ; and then she 's not forty yet , and strong and able for anything . It is too soon for her to give up business . "
81126	81136	81138	81139	the charwoman	1946	" She is a good hand , I daresay , "
81141	81157	81159	81159	Leah	195	" Ah ! - she understands what she has to do , - nobody better , "
81162	81182	81159	81159	Leah	195	" and it is not every one could fill her shoes - not for all the money she gets . "
81183	81189	81217	81217	she	195	" That it is not ! "
81194	81201	81217	81217	she	195	" I wonder whether the master - "
81225	81231	81217	81217	she	195	" Does n't she know ? "
81523	81533	81520	81520	me	0	" a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble . "
81599	81604	81606	81607	Mrs. Fairfax	295	" It gets late , "
81614	81669	81670	81670	She	295	" I am glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned ; for it is past six now . I have sent John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the road : one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote . "
81676	81681	81683	81683	she	295	" Here he is ! "
81685	81689	81683	81683	she	295	" Well , John "
81693	81697	81683	81683	she	295	" any news ? "
81698	81705	81720	81720	Adele	259	" They 're coming , ma'am , "
81710	81719	81720	81720	Adele	259	" They 'll be here in ten minutes . "
81875	81879	81881	81882	Mrs. Fairfax	295	" Miss Ingram ! "
81976	81982	81968	81969	Mr. Rochester	251	" Some natural tears she shed "
82094	82100	82102	82102	Adele	259	" Elles changent de toilettes , "
82118	82122	82124	82124	she	259	" Chez maman , "
82126	82169	82124	82124	she	259	" quand il y avait du monde , je le suivais partout , au salon et e leurs chambres ; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames , et c'etait si amusant : comme cela on apprend . "
82170	82179	82115	82115	she	259	" Do n't you feel hungry , Adele ? "
82180	82197	82115	82115	she	259	" Mais oui , mademoiselle : voile cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas mange . "
82198	82221	82124	82124	she	259	" Well now , while the ladies are in their rooms , I will venture down and get you something to eat . "
82572	82577	82579	82579	she	259	" What beautiful ladies ! "
82583	82612	82579	82579	she	259	" Oh , I wish I might go to them ! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by - and - bye , after dinner ? "
82613	82653	82654	82654	She	259	" No , indeed , I do n't ; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about . Never mind the ladies to - night ; perhaps you will see them to - morrow : here is your dinner . "
82803	82809	82810	82810	I	0	" et alors quel dommage ! "
83166	83180	83182	83182	I	0	" You said it was not likely they should think of being married , "
83184	83200	83182	83182	I	0	" but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other ladies . "
83201	83213	83148	83148	I	0	" Yes , I daresay : no doubt he admires her . "
83214	83219	83220	83220	I	0	" And she him , "
83223	83257	83220	83220	I	0	" look how she leans her head towards him as if she were conversing confidentially ; I wish I could see her face ; I have never had a glimpse of it yet . "
83258	83266	83268	83269	Mrs. Fairfax	295	" You will see her this evening , "
83271	83317	83268	83269	Mrs. Fairfax	295	" I happened to remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the ladies , and he said : ' Oh ! let her come into the drawing - room after dinner ; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her . ' "
83318	83337	83338	83338	I	0	" Yes ; he said that from mere politeness : I need not go , I am sure , "
83341	83415	83338	83338	I	0	" Well , I observed to him that as you were unused to company , I did not think you would like appearing before so gay a party - all strangers ; and he replied , in his quick way - ' Nonsense ! If she objects , tell her it is my particular wish ; and if she resists , say I shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy . ' "
83416	83425	83426	83426	I	0	" I will not give him that trouble , "
83429	83455	83426	83426	I	0	" I will go , if no better may be ; but I do n't like it . Shall you be there , Mrs. Fairfax ? "
83456	83563	83338	83338	I	0	" No ; I pleaded off , and he admitted my plea . I 'll tell you how to manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance , which is the most disagreeable part of the business . You must go into the drawing - room while it is empty , before the ladies leave the dinner - table ; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like ; you need not stay long after the gentlemen come in , unless you please : just let Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away - nobody will notice you . "
83564	83575	83426	83426	I	0	" Will these people remain long , do you think ? "
83576	83639	83426	83426	I	0	" Perhaps two or three weeks , certainly not more . After the Easter recess , Sir George Lynn , who was lately elected member for Millcote , will have to go up to town and take his seat ; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany him : it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield . "
84034	84041	84019	84019	Adele	259	" What is it , Adele ? "
84042	84067	84019	84019	Adele	259	" Est - ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques , mademoiselle ? Seulement pour completer ma toilette . "
84068	84088	84090	84090	I	0	" You think too much of your ' toilette , ' Adele : but you may have a flower . "
85133	85138	85126	85126	she	293	" especially wild ones ; "
85447	85453	85429	85429	she	297	" Bon jour , mesdames . "
85470	85478	85455	85456	Miss Ingram	297	" Oh , what a little puppet ! "
85484	85504	85479	85480	Lady Lynn	304	" It is Mr. Rochester 's ward , I suppose - the little French girl he was speaking of . "
85528	85536	85521	85522	Louisa Eshton	303	" What a love of a child ! "
85726	85732	85719	85719	him	290	" pere noble de theatre . "
86130	86140	86141	86141	My	0	" beauty is in the eye of the gazer . "
86489	86501	86502	86502	I	0	" He is not to them what he is to me , "
86505	86730	86502	86502	I	0	" he is not of their kind . I believe he is of mine ; - I am sure he is - I feel akin to him - I understand the language of his countenance and movements : though rank and wealth sever us widely , I have something in my brain and heart , in my blood and nerves , that assimilates me mentally to him . Did I say , a few days since , that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands ? Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster ? Blasphemy against nature ! Every good , true , vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him . I know I must conceal my sentiments : I must smother hope ; I must remember that he can not care much for me . For when I say that I am of his kind , I do not mean that I have his force to influence , and his spell to attract ; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him . I must , then , repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:- and yet , while I breathe and think , I must love him . "
87024	87037	87009	87009	she	303	" Mr. Rochester , I thought you were not fond of children ? "
87038	87042	87009	87009	she	303	" Nor am I. "
87043	87060	87009	87009	she	303	" Then , what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that ? "
87065	87073	87009	87009	she	303	" Where did you pick her up ? "
87074	87089	87009	87009	she	303	" I did not pick her up ; she was left on my hands . "
87090	87099	87009	87009	she	303	" You should have sent her to school . "
87100	87112	87009	87009	she	303	" I could not afford it : schools are so dear . "
87113	87182	87009	87009	she	303	" Why , I suppose you have a governess for her : I saw a person with her just now - is she gone ? Oh , no ! there she is still , behind the window - curtain . You pay her , of course ; I should think it quite as expensive , - more so ; for you have them both to keep in addition . "
87222	87230	87232	87232	he	251	" I have not considered the subject , "
87240	87300	87232	87232	he	251	" No , you men never do consider economy and common sense . You should hear mama on the chapter of governesses : Mary and I have had , I should think , a dozen at least in our day ; half of them detestable and the rest ridiculous , and all incubi - were they not , mama ? "
87301	87309	87310	87312	The young lady	2121	" Did you speak , my own ? "
87329	87365	87366	87367	Mrs. Dent	293	" My dearest , do n't mention governesses ; the word makes me nervous . I have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice . I thank Heaven I have now done with them ! "
87403	87407	87409	87410	her Ladyship	2127	" Tant pis ! "
87412	87421	87409	87410	her Ladyship	2127	" I hope it may do her good ! "
87438	87462	87409	87410	her Ladyship	2127	" I noticed her ; I am a judge of physiognomy , and in hers I see all the faults of her class . "
87463	87470	87472	87473	Mr. Rochester	251	" What are they , madam ? "
87476	87486	87488	87488	she	2124	" I will tell you in your private ear , "
87499	87514	87488	87488	she	2124	" But my curiosity will be past its appetite ; it craves food now . "
87515	87525	87409	87410	her Ladyship	2127	" Ask Blanche ; she is nearer you than I. "
87526	87719	87409	87410	her Ladyship	2127	" Oh , do n't refer him to me , mama ! I have just one word to say of the whole tribe ; they are a nuisance . Not that I ever suffered much from them ; I took care to turn the tables . What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss Wilsons , and Mrs. Greys , and Madame Jouberts ! Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit . The best fun was with Madame Joubert : Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing , lachrymose and low - spirited , not worth the trouble of vanquishing , in short ; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible ; no blow took effect on her . But poor Madame Joubert ! I see her yet in her raging passions , when we had driven her to extremities - spilt our tea , crumbled our bread and butter , tossed our books up to the ceiling , and played a charivari with the ruler and desk , the fender and fire - irons . Theodore , do you remember those merry days ? "
87720	87729	87731	87732	Lord Ingram	291	" Yaas , to be sure I do , "
87734	87778	87731	87732	Lord Ingram	291	" and the poor old stick used to cry out ' Oh you villains childs ! ' - and then we sermonised her on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were , when she was herself so ignorant . "
87779	87928	87409	87410	her Ladyship	2127	" We did ; and , Tedo , you know , I helped you in prosecuting or persecuting your tutor , whey - faced Mr. Vining - the parson in the pip , as we used to call him . He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other - at least Tedo and I thought so ; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of ' la belle passion , ' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our discovery ; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead - weights from the house . Dear mama , there , as soon as she got an inkling of the business , found out that it was of an immoral tendency . Did you not , my lady - mother ? "
87929	87971	87409	87410	her Ladyship	2127	" Certainly , my best . And I was quite right : depend on that : there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well - regulated house ; firstly - "
87972	88044	87731	87732	Lord Ingram	291	" Oh , gracious , mama ! Spare us the enumeration ! Au reste , we all know them : danger of bad example to innocence of childhood ; distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached - mutual alliance and reliance ; confidence thence resulting - insolence accompanying - mutiny and general blow - up . Am I right , Baroness Ingram , of Ingram Park ? "
88045	88059	87409	87410	her Ladyship	2127	" My lily - flower , you are right now , as always . "
88060	88072	87409	87410	her Ladyship	2127	" Then no more need be said : change the subject . "
88093	88134	88087	88087	her	302	" Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too ; but she was such a good creature , she would bear anything : nothing put her out . She was never cross with us ; was she , Louisa ? "
88135	88177	87731	87732	Lord Ingram	291	" No , never : we might do what we pleased ; ransack her desk and her workbox , and turn her drawers inside out ; and she was so good- natured , she would give us anything we asked for . "
88178	88184	88186	88187	Miss Ingram	297	" I suppose , now , "
88194	88236	88190	88190	her	297	" we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant : in order to avert such a visitation , I again move the introduction of a new topic . Mr. Rochester , do you second my motion ? "
88237	88252	87731	87732	Lord Ingram	291	" Madam , I support you on this point , as on every other . "
88253	88276	87731	87732	Lord Ingram	291	" Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward . Signior Eduardo , are you in voice to - night ? "
88277	88290	88190	88190	her	297	" Donna Bianca , if you command it , I will be . "
88291	88323	87731	87732	Lord Ingram	291	" Then , signior , I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs and other vocal organs , as they will be wanted on my royal service . "
88324	88337	87731	87732	Lord Ingram	291	" Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary ? "
88338	88344	88346	88346	she	2128	" A fig for Rizzio ! "
88363	88442	88346	88346	she	2128	" It is my opinion the fiddler David must have been an insipid sort of fellow ; I like black Bothwell better : to my mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him ; and history may say what it will of James Hepburn , but I have a notion , he was just the sort of wild , fierce , bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my hand . "
88443	88457	88459	88460	Mr. Rochester	251	" Gentlemen , you hear ! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell ? "
88462	88472	88474	88475	Colonel Dent	293	" I should say the preference lies with you , "
88477	88489	88474	88475	Colonel Dent	293	" On my honour , I am much obliged to you , "
88575	88591	88593	88593	she	297	" Oh , I am so sick of the young men of the present day ! "
88601	88742	88593	88593	she	297	" Poor , puny things , not fit to stir a step beyond papa 's park gates : nor to go even so far without mama 's permission and guardianship ! Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces , and their white hands , and their small feet ; as if a man had anything to do with beauty ! As if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman - her legitimate appanage and heritage ! I grant an ugly WOMAN is a blot on the fair face of creation ; but as to the GENTLEMEN , let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour : let their motto be:- Hunt , shoot , and fight : the rest is not worth a fillip . Such should be my device , were I a man . "
88743	88748	88749	88749	she	297	" Whenever I marry , "
88758	88822	88749	88749	she	297	" I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival , but a foil to me . I will suffer no competitor near the throne ; I shall exact an undivided homage : his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his mirror . Mr. Rochester , now sing , and I will play for you . "
88823	88829	88593	88593	she	297	" I am all obedience , "
88834	88860	88749	88749	she	297	" Here then is a Corsair - song . Know that I doat on Corsairs ; and for that reason , sing it con spirito . "
88861	88879	88593	88593	she	297	" Commands from Miss Ingram 's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and water . "
88880	88906	89024	89024	she	945	" Take care , then : if you do n't please me , I will shame you by showing how such things SHOULD be done . "
88907	88923	88749	88749	she	297	" That is offering a premium on incapacity : I shall now endeavour to fail . "
88924	88943	88593	88593	she	297	" Gardez - vous en bien ! If you err wilfully , I shall devise a proportionate punishment . "
88944	88967	89024	89024	she	945	" Miss Ingram ought to be clement , for she has it in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance . "
88968	88973	88975	88976	the lady	945	" Ha ! explain ! "
88978	89010	88975	88976	the lady	945	" Pardon me , madam : no need of explanation ; your own fine sense must inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital punishment . "
89011	89014	89016	89016	she	945	" Sing ! "
89032	89041	89043	89043	I	0	" Now is my time to slip away , "
89223	89229	89230	89230	he	638	" How do you do ? "
89233	89241	89230	89230	he	638	" I am very well , sir . "
89242	89256	89257	89257	I	0	" Why did you not come and speak to me in the room ? "
89282	89298	89279	89279	I	0	" I did not wish to disturb you , as you seemed engaged , sir . "
89299	89309	89230	89230	he	638	" What have you been doing during my absence ? "
89310	89319	89230	89230	he	638	" Nothing particular ; teaching Adele as usual . "
89320	89343	89279	89279	I	0	" And getting a good deal paler than you were - as I saw at first sight . What is the matter ? "
89344	89351	89230	89230	he	638	" Nothing at all , sir . "
89352	89365	89230	89230	he	638	" Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me ? "
89366	89371	89279	89279	I	0	" Not the least . "
89372	89386	89230	89230	he	638	" Return to the drawing - room : you are deserting too early . "
89387	89394	89395	89395	He	638	" I am tired , sir . "
89403	89409	89410	89410	he	638	" And a little depressed , "
89413	89420	89410	89410	he	638	" What about ? Tell me . "
89421	89433	89279	89279	I	0	" Nothing - nothing , sir . I am not depressed . "
89434	89568	89569	89569	He	2137	" But I affirm that you are : so much depressed that a few more words would bring tears to your eyes - indeed , they are there now , shining and swimming ; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag . If I had time , and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a servant passing , I would know what all this means . Well , to - night I excuse you ; but understand that so long as my visitors stay , I expect you to appear in the drawing - room every evening ; it is my wish ; do n't neglect it . Now go , and send Sophie for Adele . Good - night , my - "
89789	89793	89786	89786	they	2153	" playing charades , "
89972	89981	89983	89983	he	251	" Miss Ingram is mine , of course , "
90027	90032	90033	90033	he	251	" Will you play ? "
90126	90129	90132	90132	her	305	" No , "
90147	90374	90132	90132	her	305	" Ere long a bell tinkled , and the curtain drew up . Within the arch , the bulky figure of Sir George Lynn , whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen , was seen enveloped in a white sheet : before him , on a table , lay open a large book ; and at his side stood Amy Eshton , draped in Mr. Rochester 's cloak , and holding a book in her hand . Somebody , unseen , rang the bell merrily ; then Adele who had insisted on being one of her guardian 's party , bounded forward , scattering round her the contents of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm . Then appeared the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram , clad in white , a long veil on her head , and a wreath of roses round her brow ; by her side walked Mr. Rochester , and together they drew near the table . They knelt ; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton , dressed also in white , took up their stations behind them . A ceremony followed , in dumb show , in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage . At its termination , Colonel Dent and his party consulted in whispers for two minutes , then the Colonel called out - "
90377	90700	90701	90701	She	2170	" Mr. Rochester bowed , and the curtain fell . A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose . Its second rising displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last . The drawing - room , as I have before observed , was raised two steps above the dining - room , and on the top of the upper step , placed a yard or two back within the room , appeared a large marble basin - which I recognised as an ornament of the conservatory - where it usually stood , surrounded by exotics , and tenanted by gold fish - and whence it must have been transported with some trouble , on account of its size and weight . Seated on the carpet , by the side of this basin , was seen Mr. Rochester , costumed in shawls , with a turban on his head . His dark eyes and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly : he looked the very model of an Eastern emir , an agent or a victim of the bowstring . Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram . She , too , was attired in oriental fashion : a crimson scarf tied sash - like round the waist : an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples ; her beautifully - moulded arms bare , one of them upraised in the act of supporting a pitcher , poised gracefully on her head . Both her cast of form and feature , her complexion and her general air , suggested the idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days ; and such was doubtless the character she intended to represent . She approached the basin , and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher ; she again lifted it to her head . The personage on the well - brink now seemed to accost her ; to make some request:- "
90718	90824	90701	90701	She	2170	" From the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket , opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings ; she acted astonishment and admiration ; kneeling , he laid the treasure at her feet ; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures ; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears . It was Eliezer and Rebecca : the camels only were wanting . The divining party again laid their heads together : apparently they could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated . Colonel Dent , their spokesman , demanded "
90831	91004	91005	91005	Bridewell	333	" whereupon the curtain again descended . On its third rising only a portion of the drawing - room was disclosed ; the rest being concealed by a screen , hung with some sort of dark and coarse drapery . The marble basin was removed ; in its place , stood a deal table and a kitchen chair : these objects were visible by a very dim light proceeding from a horn lantern , the wax candles being all extinguished . Amidst this sordid scene , sat a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees , and his eyes bent on the ground . I knew Mr. Rochester ; though the begrimed face , the disordered dress his coat hanging loose from one arm , as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle , the desperate and scowling countenance , the rough , bristling hair might well have disguised him . As he moved , a chain clanked ; to his wrists were attached fetters . "
91007	91056	91005	91005	Bridewell	333	" exclaimed Colonel Dent , and the charade was solved . A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their ordinary costume , they re - entered the dining - room . Mr. Rochester led in Miss Ingram ; she was complimenting him on his acting . "
91061	91065	91058	91058	you	2172	" said she , "
91103	91104	91097	91097	highwayman	2175	" "
91114	91123	91097	91097	highwayman	2175	" he asked , turning it towards her . "

91219	91228	91231	91231	Dent	293	" She giggled , and her colour rose . "
91233	91238	91231	91231	Dent	293	" continued Mr. Rochester , "
91244	92337	91231	91231	Dent	293	" And as the other party withdrew , he and his band took the vacated seats . Miss Ingram placed herself at her leader 's right hand ; the other diviners filled the chairs on each side of him and her . I did not now watch the actors ; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise ; my attention was absorbed by the spectators ; my eyes , erewhile fixed on the arch , were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs . What charade Colonel Dent and his party played , what word they chose , how they acquitted themselves , I no longer remember ; but I still see the consultation which followed each scene : I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss Ingram , and Miss Ingram to him ; I see her incline her head towards him , till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his cheek ; I hear their mutual whisperings ; I recall their interchanged glances ; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment . I have told you , reader , that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester : I could not unlove him now , merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me - because I might pass hours in his presence , and he would never once turn his eyes in my direction - because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady , who scorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed ; who , if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance , would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation . I could not unlove him , because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady - because I read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her - because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which , if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek , was yet , in its very carelessness , captivating , and in its very pride , irresistible . There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances , though much to create despair . Much too , you will think , reader , to engender jealousy : if a woman , in my position , could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram 's . But I was not jealous : or very rarely ; - the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word . Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy : she was too inferior to excite the feeling . Pardon the seeming paradox ; I mean what I say . She was very showy , but she was not genuine : she had a fine person , many brilliant attainments ; but her mind was poor , her heart barren by nature : nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil ; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness . She was not good ; she was not original : she used to repeat sounding phrases from books : she never offered , nor had , an opinion of her own . She advocated a high tone of sentiment ; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity ; tenderness and truth were not in her . Too often she betrayed this , by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele : pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her ; sometimes ordering her from the room , and always treating her with coldness and acrimony . Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character - watched them closely , keenly , shrewdly . Yes ; the future bridegroom , Mr. Rochester himself , exercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance ; and it was from this sagacity - this guardedness of his - this perfect , clear consciousness of his fair one 's defects - this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her , that my ever - torturing pain arose . I saw he was going to marry her , for family , perhaps political reasons , because her rank and connections suited him ; I felt he had not given her his love , and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him that treasure . This was the point - this was where the nerve was touched and teased - this was where the fever was sustained and fed : SHE COULD NOT CHARM HIM . If she had managed the victory at once , and he had yielded and sincerely laid his heart at her feet , I should have covered my face , turned to the wall , and figuratively have died to them . If Miss Ingram had been a good and noble woman , endowed with force , fervour , kindness , sense , I should have had one vital struggle with two tigers - jealousy and despair : then , my heart torn out and devoured , I should have admired her - acknowledged her excellence , and been quiet for the rest of my days : and the more absolute her superiority , the deeper would have been my admiration - the more truly tranquil my quiescence . But as matters really stood , to watch Miss Ingram 's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester , to witness their repeated failure - herself unconscious that they did fail ; vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark , and infatuatedly pluming herself on success , when her pride and self - complacency repelled further and further what she wished to allure - to witness THIS , was to be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint . Because , when she failed , I saw how she might have succeeded . Arrows that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester 's breast and fell harmless at his feet , might , I knew , if shot by a surer hand , have quivered keen in his proud heart - have called love into his stern eye , and softness into his sardonic face ; or , better still , without weapons a silent conquest might have been won . "
92357	92362	92340	92340	she	2183	" I asked myself . "
92565	93558	92547	92548	his wife	4986	" I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester 's project of marrying for interest and connections . It surprised me when I first discovered that such was his intention : I had thought him a man unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife ; but the longer I considered the position , education , c. , of the parties , the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them , doubtless , from their childhood . All their class held these principles : I supposed , then , they had reasons for holding them such as I could not fathom . It seemed to me that , were I a gentleman like him , I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love ; but the very obviousness of the advantages to the husband 's own happiness offered by this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of which I was quite ignorant : otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I wished to act . But in other points , as well as this , I was growing very lenient to my master : I was forgetting all his faults , for which I had once kept a sharp look - out . It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of his character : to take the bad with the good ; and from the just weighing of both , to form an equitable judgment . Now I saw no bad . The sarcasm that had repelled , the harshness that had startled me once , were only like keen condiments in a choice dish : their presence was pungent , but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid . And as for the vague something - was it a sinister or a sorrowful , a designing or a desponding expression ? - that opened upon a careful observer , now and then , in his eye , and closed again before one could fathom the strange depth partially disclosed ; that something which used to make me fear and shrink , as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic - looking hills , and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape : that something , I , at intervals , beheld still ; and with throbbing heart , but not with palsied nerves . Instead of wishing to shun , I longed only to dare - to divine it ; and I thought Miss Ingram happy , because one day she might look into the abyss at her leisure , explore its secrets and analyse their nature . Meantime , while I thought only of my master and his future bride - saw only them , heard only their discourse , and considered only their movements of importance - the rest of the party were occupied with their own separate interests and pleasures . The Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued to consort in solemn conferences , where they nodded their two turbans at each other , and held up their four hands in confronting gestures of surprise , or mystery , or horror , according to the theme on which their gossip ran , like a pair of magnified puppets . Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good - natured Mrs. Eshton ; and the two sometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me . Sir George Lynn , Colonel Dent , and Mr. Eshton discussed politics , or county affairs , or justice business . Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton ; Louisa played and sang to and with one of the Messrs. Lynn ; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant speeches of the other . Sometimes all , as with one consent , suspended their by - play to observe and listen to the principal actors : for , after all , Mr. Rochester and - because closely connected with him - Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party . If he was absent from the room an hour , a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his guests ; and his re - entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation . The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business , and was not likely to return till late . The afternoon was wet : a walk the party had proposed to take to see a gipsy camp , lately pitched on a common beyond Hay , was consequently deferred . Some of the gentlemen were gone to the stables : the younger ones , together with the younger ladies , were playing billiards in the billiard - room . The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards . Blanche Ingram , after having repelled , by supercilious taciturnity , some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation , had first murmured over some sentimental tunes and airs on the piano , and then , having fetched a novel from the library , had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa , and prepared to beguile , by the spell of fiction , the tedious hours of absence . The room and the house were silent : only now and then the merriment of the billiard - players was heard from above . It was verging on dusk , and the clock had already given warning of the hour to dress for dinner , when little Adele , who knelt by me in the drawing - room window - seat , suddenly exclaimed - "
93567	93623	93561	93562	Monsieur Rochester	271	" I turned , and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa : the others , too , looked up from their several occupations ; for at the same time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse - hoofs became audible on the wet gravel . A post - chaise was approaching . "
93635	93640	93641	93641	He	271	" said Miss Ingram . "
93670	93773	93664	93664	he	271	" As she said this , she approached her tall person and ample garments so near the window , that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my spine : in her eagerness she did not observe me at first , but when she did , she curled her lip and moved to another casement . The post - chaise stopped ; the driver rang the door - bell , and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb ; but it was not Mr. Rochester ; it was a tall , fashionable - looking man , a stranger . "
93777	93782	93783	93783	you	2192	" exclaimed Miss Ingram : "
93787	93791	93783	93783	you	2192	" apostrophising Adele , "
93804	93851	93783	93783	you	2192	" and she cast on me an angry glance , as if I were in fault . Some parleying was audible in the hall , and soon the new - comer entered . He bowed to Lady Ingram , as deeming her the eldest lady present . "
93863	93867	93854	93854	I	0	" said he , "
93910	94305	93907	93907	he	251	" His manner was polite ; his accent , in speaking , struck me as being somewhat unusual , - not precisely foreign , but still not altogether English : his age might be about Mr. Rochester 's , - between thirty and forty ; his complexion was singularly sallow : otherwise he was a fine - looking man , at first sight especially . On closer examination , you detected something in his face that displeased , or rather that failed to please . His features were regular , but too relaxed : his eye was large and well cut , but the life looking out of it was a tame , vacant life - at least so I thought . The sound of the dressing - bell dispersed the party . It was not till after dinner that I saw him again : he then seemed quite at his ease . But I liked his physiognomy even less than before : it struck me as being at the same time unsettled and inanimate . His eye wandered , and had no meaning in its wandering : this gave him an odd look , such as I never remembered to have seen . For a handsome and not an unamiable - looking man , he repelled me exceedingly : there was no power in that smooth - skinned face of a full oval shape : no firmness in that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth ; there was no thought on the low , even forehead ; no command in that blank , brown eye . As I sat in my usual nook , and looked at him with the light of the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him - for he occupied an arm - chair drawn close to the fire , and kept shrinking still nearer , as if he were cold , I compared him with Mr. Rochester . I think with deference be it spoken the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon : between a meek sheep and the rough - coated keen - eyed dog , its guardian . He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend . A curious friendship theirs must have been : a pointed illustration , indeed , of the old adage that "
94309	94383	94384	94386	a beautiful man	2196	" Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him , and I caught at times scraps of their conversation across the room . At first I could not make much sense of what I heard ; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram , who sat nearer to me , confused the fragmentary sentences that reached me at intervals . These last were discussing the stranger ; they both called him "
94388	94393	94384	94386	a beautiful man	2196	" Louisa said he was "
94400	94403	94384	94386	a beautiful man	2196	" and she "
94407	94412	94384	94386	a beautiful man	2196	" and Mary instanced his "
94421	94429	94384	94386	a beautiful man	2196	" as her ideal of the charming . "
94440	94467	94384	94386	a beautiful man	2196	" cried Louisa , - ' so smooth - none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much ; and such a placid eye and smile ! "
94791	94795	94785	94785	I	0	" old woman , "
94797	94801	94785	94785	I	0	" quite troublesome . "
94802	94820	94822	94823	the magistrate	2211	" Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself off , "
94825	94830	94832	94833	Colonel Dent	293	" No - stop ! "
94835	94857	94862	94862	he	290	" Do n't send her away , Eshton ; we might turn the thing to account ; better consult the ladies . "
94865	94926	94862	94862	he	290	" Ladies , you talked of going to Hay Common to visit the gipsy camp ; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches is in the servants ' hall at this moment , and insists upon being brought in before ' the quality , ' to tell them their fortunes . Would you like to see her ? "
94927	94932	94934	94935	Lady Ingram	305	" Surely , colonel , "
94937	94957	94934	94935	Lady Ingram	305	" you would not encourage such a low impostor ? Dismiss her , by all means , at once ! "
94958	94972	94974	94975	the footman	2212	" But I can not persuade her to go away , my lady , "
94977	95027	94974	94975	the footman	2212	" nor can any of the servants : Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now , entreating her to be gone ; but she has taken a chair in the chimney- comer , and says nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here . "
95028	95034	95036	95037	Mrs. Eshton	294	" What does she want ? "
95039	95064	95036	95037	Mrs. Eshton	294	" ' To tell the gentry their fortunes , ' she says , ma'am ; and she swears she must and will do it . "
95065	95071	95073	95075	the Misses Eshton	338	" What is she like ? "
95081	95097	95073	95075	the Misses Eshton	338	" A shockingly ugly old creature , miss ; almost as black as a crock . "
95098	95107	95109	95110	Frederick Lynn	308	" Why , she 's a real sorceress ! "
95112	95122	95109	95110	Frederick Lynn	308	" Let us have her in , of course . "
95123	95128	95130	95131	his brother	5216	" To be sure , "
95133	95149	95130	95131	his brother	5216	" it would be a thousand pities to throw away such a chance of fun . "
95150	95161	95163	95164	Mrs. Lynn	339	" My dear boys , what are you thinking about ? "
95166	95177	95180	95182	the Dowager Ingram	305	" I can not possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding , "
95184	95196	95180	95182	the Dowager Ingram	305	" Indeed , mama , but you can - and will , "
95229	95249	95217	95217	she	295	" I have a curiosity to hear my fortune told : therefore , Sam , order the beldame forward . "
95250	95257	95180	95182	the Dowager Ingram	305	" My darling Blanche ! recollect - "
95258	95280	95217	95217	she	295	" I do - I recollect all you can suggest ; and I must have my will - quick , Sam ! "
95281	95288	95290	95292	all the juveniles	2214	" Yes - yes - yes ! "
95299	95310	95311	95312	The footman	2212	" Let her come - it will be excellent sport ! "
95316	95324	95326	95326	he	2212	" She looks such a rough one , "
95328	95331	95326	95326	he	2212	" Go ! "
95361	95368	95370	95370	he	1375	" She wo n't come now , "
95372	95419	95370	95370	he	1375	" She says it 's not her mission to appear before the ' vulgar herd ' them 's her words . I must show her into a room by herself , and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by one . "
95420	95429	95431	95432	Lady Ingram	305	" You see now , my queenly Blanche , "
95447	95448	95441	95443	my angel girl	2221	" "
95458	95462	95441	95443	my angel girl	2221	" cut in the "
95466	95467	95441	95443	my angel girl	2221	" "
95500	95501	95507	95507	she	2220	" "
95513	95514	95507	95507	she	2220	" "
95526	95544	95507	95507	she	2220	" Again Sam vanished ; and mystery , animation , expectation rose to full flow once more . "
95550	95559	95560	95560	She	2220	" said the footman , as he reappeared . "
95571	95572	95573	95573	I	0	" "
95590	95595	95597	95597	her	2220	" said Colonel Dent . "
95606	95612	95613	95613	She	2220	" Sam went and returned . "
95637	95647	95662	95662	Jove	340	" he added , with difficulty suppressing a titter , "
95659	95660	95653	95657	the young , and single	2234	" "
95668	95678	95679	95679	I	0	" exclaimed Henry Lynn . Miss Ingram rose solemnly : "
95683	95711	95679	95679	I	0	" she said , in a tone which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope , mounting a breach in the van of his men . "
95726	95769	95679	95679	I	0	" was her mama 's cry ; but she swept past her in stately silence , passed through the door which Colonel Dent held open , and we heard her enter the library . A comparative silence ensued . Lady Ingram thought it "
95772	95894	95907	95907	she	2235	" to wring her hands : which she did accordingly . Miss Mary declared she felt , for her part , she never dared venture . Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under their breath , and looked a little frightened . The minutes passed very slowly : fifteen were counted before the library - door again opened . Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch . Would she laugh ? Would she take it as a joke ? All eyes met her with a glance of eager curiosity , and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and coldness ; she looked neither flurried nor merry : she walked stiffly to her seat , and took it in silence . "
95899	95904	95907	95907	she	2235	" said Lord Ingram . "
95912	95916	95907	95907	she	2235	" asked Mary . "
95936	95942	95929	95929	she	2235	" demanded the Misses Eshton . "
95950	95955	95947	95948	good people	2239	" returned Miss Ingram , "
96071	96320	96324	96324	she	2247	" Miss Ingram took a book , leant back in her chair , and so declined further conversation . I watched her for nearly half - an - hour : during all that time she never turned a page , and her face grew momently darker , more dissatisfied , and more sourly expressive of disappointment . She had obviously not heard anything to her advantage : and it seemed to me , from her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity , that she herself , notwithstanding her professed indifference , attached undue importance to whatever revelations had been made her . Meantime , Mary Ingram , Amy and Louisa Eshton , declared they dared not go alone ; and yet they all wished to go . A negotiation was opened through the medium of the ambassador , Sam ; and after much pacing to and fro , till , I think , the said Sam 's calves must have ached with the exercise , permission was at last , with great difficulty , extorted from the rigorous Sibyl , for the three to wait upon her in a body . Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram 's had been : we heard hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library ; and at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open , and came running across the hall , as if they were half - scared out of their wits . "
96330	96338	96339	96339	She	2247	" they cried , one and all . "
96351	96577	96345	96345	She	2247	" and they sank breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them . Pressed for further explanation , they declared she had told them of things they had said and done when they were mere children ; described books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home : keepsakes that different relations had presented to them . They affirmed that she had even divined their thoughts , and had whispered in the ear of each the name of the person she liked best in the world , and informed them of what they most wished for . Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further enlightened on these two last - named points ; but they got only blushes , ejaculations , tremors , and titters , in return for their importunity . The matrons , meantime , offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans ; and again and again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had not been taken in time ; and the elder gentlemen laughed , and the younger urged their services on the agitated fair ones . In the midst of the tumult , and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged in the scene before me , I heard a hem close at my elbow : I turned , and saw Sam . "
96639	96640	96635	96635	I	0	" "
96650	96706	96643	96643	I	0	" I answered : and I was glad of the unexpected opportunity to gratify my much - excited curiosity . I slipped out of the room , unobserved by any eye - for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned - and I closed the door quietly behind me . "
96713	96717	96711	96711	miss	4359	" said Sam , "
96741	96742	96736	96736	I	0	" "
96760	97051	96752	96752	I	0	" Nor was I ; but I was a good deal interested and excited . CHAPTER XIX The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it , and the Sibyl - if Sibyl she were - was seated snugly enough in an easy - chair at the chimney - corner . She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet : or rather , a broad - brimmed gipsy hat , tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin . An extinguished candle stood on the table ; she was bending over the fire , and seemed reading in a little black book , like a prayer - book , by the light of the blaze : she muttered the words to herself , as most old women do , while she read ; she did not desist immediately on my entrance : it appeared she wished to finish a paragraph . I stood on the rug and warmed my hands , which were rather cold with sitting at a distance from the drawing - room fire . I felt now as composed as ever I did in my life : there was nothing indeed in the gipsy 's appearance to trouble one 's calm . She shut her book and slowly looked up ; her hat - brim partially shaded her face , yet I could see , as she raised it , that it was a strange one . It looked all brown and black : elf - locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin , and came half over her cheeks , or rather jaws : her eye confronted me at once , with a bold and direct gaze . "
97061	97080	96752	96752	I	0	" she said , in a voice as decided as her glance , as harsh as her features . "

Having indulged a while in this sedative , she raised her bent body , took the pipe from her lips , and while gazing steadily at the fire , said very deliberately - "

97316	97320	97321	97321	I	0	" I rejoined . "

97800	97849	97850	97850	I	0	" I knelt within half a yard of her . She stirred the fire , so that a ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal : the glare , however , as she sat , only threw her face into deeper shadow : mine , it illumined . "
97863	97875	97855	97855	you	2257	" she said , when she had examined me a while . "

98090	98094	98088	98088	you	2257	" thought I ; "
98106	98107	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" "
98113	98203	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" continued the strange being ; ' she 's a safe hand is Mrs. Poole : close and quiet ; any one may repose confidence in her . But , as I was saying : sitting in that window - seat , do you think of nothing but your future school ? Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you ? Is there not one face you study ? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity ? "
98204	98217	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" I like to observe all the faces and all the figures . "
98218	98236	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" But do you never single one from the rest - or it may be , two ? "
98237	98262	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" I do frequently ; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a tale : it amuses me to watch them . "
98263	98273	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" What tale do you like best to hear ? "
98274	98304	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" Oh , I have not much choice ! They generally run on the same theme - courtship ; and promise to end in the same catastrophe - marriage . "
98305	98314	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" And do you like that monotonous theme ? "
98315	98331	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" Positively , I do n't care about it : it is nothing to me . "
98332	98373	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" Nothing to you ? When a lady , young and full of life and health , charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune , sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you - "
98374	98378	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" I what ? "
98379	98389	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" You know - and perhaps think well of . "
98390	98473	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" I do n't know the gentlemen here . I have scarcely interchanged a syllable with one of them ; and as to thinking well of them , I consider some respectable , and stately , and middle - aged , and others young , dashing , handsome , and lively : but certainly they are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles they please , without my feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me . "
98474	98505	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" You do n't know the gentlemen here ? You have not exchanged a syllable with one of them ? Will you say that of the master of the house ! "
98506	98513	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" He is not at home . "
98514	98567	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" A profound remark ! A most ingenious quibble ! He went to Millcote this morning , and will be back here to - night or to - morrow : does that circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance - blot him , as it were , out of existence ? "
98568	98589	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" No ; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme you had introduced . "
98590	98634	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen ; and of late so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester 's eyes that they overflow like two cups filled above the brim : have you never remarked that ? "
98635	98649	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests . "
98650	98687	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" No question about his right : but have you never observed that , of all the tales told here about matrimony , Mr. Rochester has been favoured with the most lively and the most continuous ? "
98688	98701	98097	98097	diablerie	2272	" The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator . "
98776	98782	98784	98784	she	2273	" Eagerness of a listener ! "
98786	98837	98784	98784	she	2273	" yes ; Mr. Rochester has sat by the hour , his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight in their task of communicating ; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him ; you have noticed this ? "
98838	98851	98784	98784	she	2273	" Grateful ! I can not remember detecting gratitude in his face . "
98852	98871	98872	98872	I	0	" Detecting ! You have analysed , then . And what did you detect , if not gratitude ? "
98876	98904	98872	98872	I	0	" You have seen love : have you not ? - and , looking forward , you have seen him married , and beheld his bride happy ? "
98905	98921	98784	98784	she	2273	" Humph ! Not exactly . Your witch 's skill is rather at fault sometimes . "
98922	98932	98784	98784	she	2273	" What the devil have you seen , then ? "
98933	98958	98784	98784	she	2273	" Never mind : I came here to inquire , not to confess . Is it known that Mr. Rochester is to be married ? "
98959	98969	98784	98784	she	2273	" Yes ; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram . "
98970	98973	98784	98784	she	2273	" Shortly ? "
98974	99117	98784	98784	she	2273	" Appearances would warrant that conclusion : and , no doubt though , with an audacity that wants chastising out of you , you seem to question it , they will be a superlatively happy pair . He must love such a handsome , noble , witty , accomplished lady ; and probably she loves him , or , if not his person , at least his purse . I know she considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last degree ; though God pardon me ! I told her something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous grave : the corners of her mouth fell half an inch . I would advise her blackaviced suitor to look out : if another comes , with a longer or clearer rent - roll , - he 's dished - "
99118	99150	98784	98784	she	2273	" But , mother , I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester 's fortune : I came to hear my own ; and you have told me nothing of it . "
99151	99243	98784	98784	she	2273	" Your fortune is yet doubtful : when I examined your face , one trait contradicted another . Chance has meted you a measure of happiness : that I know . I knew it before I came here this evening . She has laid it carefully on one side for you . I saw her do it . It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand , and take it up : but whether you will do so , is the problem I study . Kneel again on the rug . "
99244	99256	99257	99257	I	0	" Do n't keep me long ; the fire scorches me . "
99282	99406	99277	99277	She	2274	" The flame flickers in the eye ; the eye shines like dew ; it looks soft and full of feeling ; it smiles at my jargon : it is susceptible ; impression follows impression through its clear sphere ; where it ceases to smile , it is sad ; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid : that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness . It turns from me ; it will not suffer further scrutiny ; it seems to deny , by a mocking glance , the truth of the discoveries I have already made , - to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin : its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion . The eye is favourable . "
99487	99680	99686	99686	your	2276	" I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow ; and that brow professes to say , - ' I can live alone , if self - respect , and circumstances require me so to do . I need not sell my soul to buy bliss . I have an inward treasure born with me , which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld , or offered only at a price I can not afford to give . ' The forehead declares , ' Reason sits firm and holds the reins , and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild chasms . The passions may rage furiously , like true heathens , as they are ; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things : but judgment shall still have the last word in every argument , and the casting vote in every decision . Strong wind , earthquake - shock , and fire may pass by : but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of conscience . ' "
99885	100098	100104	100104	you	146	" Where was I ? Did I wake or sleep ? Had I been dreaming ? Did I dream still ? The old woman 's voice had changed : her accent , her gesture , and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass - as the speech of my own tongue . I got up , but did not go . I looked ; I stirred the fire , and I looked again : but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her face , and again beckoned me to depart . The flame illuminated her hand stretched out : roused now , and on the alert for discoveries , I at once noticed that hand . It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own ; it was a rounded supple member , with smooth fingers , symmetrically turned ; a broad ring flashed on the little finger , and stooping forward , I looked at it , and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before . Again I looked at the face ; which was no longer turned from me - on the contrary , the bonnet was doffed , the bandage displaced , the head advanced . "
100108	100114	100101	100101	Jane	146	" asked the familiar voice . "
100127	100128	100101	100101	Jane	146	" "

100160	100170	100173	100173	sir	4374	" And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his disguise . "

100348	100458	100336	100336	you	4374	" I reflected , and thought , on the whole , I had . It was a comfort ; but , indeed , I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the interview . Something of masquerade I suspected . I knew gipsies and fortune - tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had expressed herself ; besides I had noted her feigned voice , her anxiety to conceal her features . But my mind had been running on Grace Poole - that living enigma , that mystery of mysteries , as I considered her . I had never thought of Mr. Rochester . "

100675	100723	100658	100658	he	799	" Mr. Rochester was standing near me ; he had taken my hand , as if to lead me to a chair . As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip ; the smile on his lips froze : apparently a spasm caught his breath . "
100731	100750	100751	100751	Mason	337	" he said , in the tone one might fancy a speaking automaton to enounce its single words ; "
100758	100793	100658	100658	he	799	" he reiterated ; and he went over the syllables three times , growing , in the intervals of speaking , whiter than ashes : he hardly seemed to know what he was doing . "
100801	100805	100806	100806	Jane	146	" I inquired . "
100822	100826	100814	100814	I	0	" He staggered . "

I found all the party in the dining - room at supper , as Mr. Rochester had said ; they were not seated at table , - the supper was arranged on the sideboard ; each had taken what he chose , and they stood about here and there in groups , their plates and glasses in their hands . Every one seemed in high glee ; laughter and conversation were general and animated . Mr. Mason stood near the fire , talking to Colonel and Mrs. Dent , and appeared as merry as any of them . I filled a wine - glass I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so : she thought I was taking a liberty , I daresay , and I returned to the library . Mr. Rochester 's extreme pallor had disappeared , and he looked once more firm and stern . He took the glass from my hand . "
101220	101234	101237	101237	they	2307	" he said . He swallowed the contents and returned it to me . "

I sought Mr. Mason , delivered the message , and preceded him from the room : I ushered him into the library , and then I went upstairs . At a late hour , after I had been in bed some time , I heard the visitors repair to their chambers : I distinguished Mr. Rochester 's voice , and heard him say , "
101640	101947	101544	101544	sir	4374	" He spoke cheerfully : the gay tones set my heart at ease . I was soon asleep . CHAPTER XX I had forgotten to draw my curtain , which I usually did , and also to let down my window - blind . The consequence was , that when the moon , which was full and bright for the night was fine , came in her course to that space in the sky opposite my casement , and looked in at me through the unveiled panes , her glorious gaze roused me . Awaking in the dead of night , I opened my eyes on her disk - silver - white and crystal clear . It was beautiful , but too solemn ; I half rose , and stretched my arm to draw the curtain . Good God ! What a cry ! The night - its silence - its rest , was rent in twain by a savage , a sharp , a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall . My pulse stopped : my heart stood still ; my stretched arm was paralysed . The cry died , and was not renewed . Indeed , whatever being uttered that fearful shriek could not soon repeat it : not the widest - winged condor on the Andes could , twice in succession , send out such a yell from the cloud shrouding his eyrie . The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere it could repeat the effort . It came out of the third storey ; for it passed overhead . And overhead - yes , in the room just above my chamber - ceiling - I now heard a struggle : a deadly one it seemed from the noise ; and a half - smothered voice shouted - "
101954	101959	101544	101544	sir	4374	" three times rapidly . "
101965	101987	101988	101988	Rochester	251	" it cried ; and then , while the staggering and stamping went on wildly , I distinguished through plank and plaster:- "
101999	102095	101544	101544	sir	4374	" A chamber - door opened : some one ran , or rushed , along the gallery . Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell ; and there was silence . I had put on some clothes , though horror shook all my limbs ; I issued from my apartment . The sleepers were all aroused : ejaculations , terrified murmurs sounded in every room ; door after door unclosed ; one looked out and another looked out ; the gallery filled . Gentlemen and ladies alike had quitted their beds ; and "

102208	102209	102199	102199	I	0	" "
102214	102220	102199	102199	I	0	" was shouted in return . "
102232	102280	102228	102228	I	0	" And the door at the end of the gallery opened , and Mr. Rochester advanced with a candle : he had just descended from the upper storey . One of the ladies ran to him directly ; she seized his arm : it was Miss Ingram . "
102288	102292	102228	102228	I	0	" said she . "
102303	102304	102228	102228	I	0	" "
102315	102350	102228	102228	I	0	" he replied : for the Misses Eshton were clinging about him now ; and the two dowagers , in vast white wrappers , were bearing down on him like ships in full sail . "
102360	102364	102228	102228	I	0	" he cried . "
102387	102408	102382	102382	I	0	" And dangerous he looked : his black eyes darted sparks . Calming himself by an effort , he added - "
102530	102535	102529	102529	Mesdames	346	" to the dowagers , "
102555	102860	102529	102529	Mesdames	346	" And so , by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding , he contrived to get them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories . I did not wait to be ordered back to mine , but retreated unnoticed , as unnoticed I had left it . Not , however , to go to bed : on the contrary , I began and dressed myself carefully . The sounds I had heard after the scream , and the words that had been uttered , had probably been heard only by me ; for they had proceeded from the room above mine : but they assured me that it was not a servant 's dream which had thus struck horror through the house ; and that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to pacify his guests . I dressed , then , to be ready for emergencies . When dressed , I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what . It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry , struggle , and call . No : stillness returned : each murmur and movement ceased gradually , and in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert . It seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire . Meantime the moon declined : she was about to set . Not liking to sit in the cold and darkness , I thought I would lie down on my bed , dressed as I was . I left the window , and moved with little noise across the carpet ; as I stooped to take off my shoes , a cautious hand tapped low at the door . "
102865	102869	102529	102529	Mesdames	346	" I asked . "
102874	102890	102893	102893	sir	4374	" asked the voice I expected to hear , viz . , my master 's . "
102895	102896	102893	102893	sir	4374	" "
102900	102901	102529	102529	Mesdames	346	" "
102904	102905	102529	102529	Mesdames	346	" "
102913	102927	102529	102529	Mesdames	346	" I obeyed . Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light . "
102932	102936	102928	102928	I	0	" he said : "
102950	103001	102928	102928	I	0	" My slippers were thin : I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat . He glided up the gallery and up the stairs , and stopped in the dark , low corridor of the fateful third storey : I had followed and stood at his side . "
103010	103017	103020	103020	sir	4374	" he asked in a whisper . "
103022	103023	103020	103020	sir	4374	" "
103032	103033	103020	103020	sir	4374	" "
103036	103037	103020	103020	sir	4374	" "
103044	103104	103020	103020	sir	4374	" I returned , sought the sponge on the washstand , the salts in my drawer , and once more retraced my steps . He still waited ; he held a key in his hand : approaching one of the small , black doors , he put it in the lock ; he paused , and addressed me again . "
103116	103117	103118	103118	I	0	" "
103131	103149	103124	103124	I	0	" I felt a thrill while I answered him ; but no coldness , and no faintness . "
103156	103160	103153	103153	your	0	" he said : "
103171	103179	103124	103124	I	0	" I put my fingers into his . "
103184	103290	103124	103124	I	0	" was his remark : he turned the key and opened the door . I saw a room I remembered to have seen before , the day Mrs. Fairfax showed me over the house : it was hung with tapestry ; but the tapestry was now looped up in one part , and there was a door apparent , which had then been concealed . This door was open ; a light shone out of the room within : I heard thence a snarling , snatching sound , almost like a dog quarrelling . Mr. Rochester , putting down his candle , said to me , "
103295	103362	103124	103124	I	0	" and he went forward to the inner apartment . A shout of laughter greeted his entrance ; noisy at first , and terminating in Grace Poole 's own goblin ha ! ha ! SHE then was there . He made some sort of arrangement without speaking , though I heard a low voice address him : he came out and closed the door behind him . "
103367	103479	103365	103365	Jane	146	" he said ; and I walked round to the other side of a large bed , which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of the chamber . An easy - chair was near the bed - head : a man sat in it , dressed with the exception of his coat ; he was still ; his head leant back ; his eyes were closed . Mr. Rochester held the candle over him ; I recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face - the stranger , Mason : I saw too that his linen on one side , and one arm , was almost soaked in blood . "
103484	103504	103365	103365	Jane	146	" said Mr. Rochester , and I took it : he fetched a basin of water from the washstand : "
103508	103583	103365	103365	Jane	146	" said he . I obeyed . He took the sponge , dipped it in , and moistened the corpse - like face ; he asked for my smelling - bottle , and applied it to the nostrils . Mr. Mason shortly unclosed his eyes ; he groaned . Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of the wounded man , whose arm and shoulder were bandaged : he sponged away blood , trickling fast down . "
103589	103594	103365	103365	Jane	146	" murmured Mr. Mason . "
103640	103644	103645	103645	Sir	4374	" he continued . "
103647	103648	103645	103645	Sir	4374	" "
103753	103816	103745	103745	I	0	" Again the poor man groaned ; he looked as if he dared not move ; fear , either of death or of something else , appeared almost to paralyse him . Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand , and I proceeded to use it as he had done . He watched me a second , then saying , "
103823	104617	104618	104618	Jane	146	" he left the room . I experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock , and the sound of his retreating step ceased to be heard . Here then I was in the third storey , fastened into one of its mystic cells ; night around me ; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and hands ; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door : yes - that was appalling - the rest I could bear ; but I shuddered at the thought of Grace Poole bursting out upon me . I must keep to my post , however . I must watch this ghastly countenance - these blue , still lips forbidden to unclose - these eyes now shut , now opening , now wandering through the room , now fixing on me , and ever glazed with the dulness of horror . I must dip my hand again and again in the basin of blood and water , and wipe away the trickling gore . I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment ; the shadows darken on the wrought , antique tapestry round me , and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed , and quiver strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite - whose front , divided into twelve panels , bore , in grim design , the heads of the twelve apostles , each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame ; while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ . According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or glanced there , it was now the bearded physician , Luke , that bent his brow ; now St. John 's long hair that waved ; and anon the devilish face of Judas , that grew out of the panel , and seemed gathering life and threatening a revelation of the arch - traitor - of Satan himself - in his subordinate 's form . Amidst all this , I had to listen as well as watch : to listen for the movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den . But since Mr. Rochester 's visit it seemed spellbound : all the night I heard but three sounds at three long intervals , - a step creak , a momentary renewal of the snarling , canine noise , and a deep human groan . Then my own thoughts worried me . What crime was this that lived incarnate in this sequestered mansion , and could neither be expelled nor subdued by the owner ? - what mystery , that broke out now in fire and now in blood , at the deadest hours of night ? What creature was it , that , masked in an ordinary woman 's face and shape , uttered the voice , now of a mocking demon , and anon of a carrion - seeking bird of prey ? And this man I bent over - this commonplace , quiet stranger - how had he become involved in the web of horror ? and why had the Fury flown at him ? What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season , when he should have been asleep in bed ? I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him an apartment below - what brought him here ! And why , now , was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him ? Why did he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced ? Why DID Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment ? His guest had been outraged , his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted against ; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion ! Lastly , I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester ; that the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness of the former : the few words which had passed between them assured me of this . It was evident that in their former intercourse , the passive disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active energy of the other : whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester 's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason 's arrival ? Why had the mere name of this unresisting individual - whom his word now sufficed to control like a child - fallen on him , a few hours since , as a thunderbolt might fall on an oak ? Oh ! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered : "
104634	104673	104632	104632	Jane	146	" I could not forget how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder : and it was no light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester . "
104684	104900	104632	104632	Jane	146	" I cried inwardly , as the night lingered and lingered - as my bleeding patient drooped , moaned , sickened : and neither day nor aid arrived . I had , again and again , held the water to Mason 's white lips ; again and again offered him the stimulating salts : my efforts seemed ineffectual : either bodily or mental suffering , or loss of blood , or all three combined , were fast prostrating his strength . He moaned so , and looked so weak , wild , and lost , I feared he was dying ; and I might not even speak to him . The candle , wasted at last , went out ; as it expired , I perceived streaks of grey light edging the window curtains : dawn was then approaching . Presently I heard Pilot bark far below , out of his distant kennel in the courtyard : hope revived . Nor was it unwarranted : in five minutes more the grating key , the yielding lock , warned me my watch was relieved . It could not have lasted more than two hours : many a week has seemed shorter . Mr. Rochester entered , and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch . "
104910	104917	104903	104903	Carter	270	" he said to this last : "
104943	104944	104918	104918	I	0	" "
104954	104955	104918	104918	I	0	" "
104983	105042	105045	105047	my good fellow	2348	" Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain , drew up the holland blind , let in all the daylight he could ; and I was surprised and cheered to see how far dawn was advanced : what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the east . Then he approached Mason , whom the surgeon was already handling . "
105053	105057	105058	105058	She	2349	" he asked . "
105067	105073	105058	105058	She	2349	" was the faint reply . "
105115	105116	105106	105106	Carter	270	" "
105123	105134	105117	105117	I	0	" said Carter , who had now undone the bandages ; "
105185	105186	105187	105187	She	2349	" "
105191	105195	105196	105196	She	2349	" he murmured . "
105211	105212	105213	105213	You	251	" "
105228	105233	105219	105219	you	251	" said Mr. Rochester . "
105244	105248	105241	105241	one	4415	" returned Mason . "
105255	105261	105241	105241	one	4415	" he added , shuddering . "
105276	105277	105269	105269	she	2349	" "
105282	105289	105290	105290	I	0	" was his friend 's answer ; "
105334	105335	105336	105336	I	0	" "
105345	105346	105347	105347	You	251	" "
105410	105411	105390	105390	Carter	270	" "
105444	105445	105446	105446	She	2349	" "
105459	105492	105451	105451	she	2349	" said Mason . I saw Mr. Rochester shudder : a singularly marked expression of disgust , horror , hatred , warped his countenance almost to distortion ; but he only said - "
105511	105512	105513	105513	I	0	" "
105520	105525	105526	105526	You	308	" was the answer . "
105566	105567	105557	105557	you	308	" "
105574	105575	105557	105557	you	308	" "
105631	105646	105612	105612	Carter	270	" he turned to me for the first time since his re - entrance , "
105693	105714	105612	105612	Carter	270	" I went ; sought the repository he had mentioned , found the articles named , and returned with them . "
105717	105721	105612	105612	Carter	270	" said he , "
105749	105755	105757	105757	anybody	4330	" I retired as directed . "
105767	105773	105757	105757	anybody	4330	" inquired Mr. Rochester presently . "
105783	105784	105757	105757	anybody	4330	" "
105904	105923	105874	105874	your	308	" Again I ran , and again returned , bearing an immense mantle lined and edged with fur . "
105933	105939	105926	105926	I	0	" said my untiring master ; "
106001	106013	105972	105972	You	146	" I flew thither and back , bringing the desired vessels . "
106088	106110	106082	106082	Jane	146	" He held out the tiny glass , and I half filled it from the water - bottle on the washstand . "
106124	106144	106147	106147	Richard	308	" I did so ; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid , and presented it to Mason . "
106164	106165	106147	106147	Richard	308	" "
106177	106178	106147	106147	Richard	308	" "
106185	106237	106147	106147	Richard	308	" Mr. Mason obeyed , because it was evidently useless to resist . He was dressed now : he still looked pale , but he was no longer gory and sullied . Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the liquid ; he then took his arm - "
106249	106253	106239	106239	I	0	" he said - "
106256	106261	106262	106262	Carter	270	" The patient rose . "
106285	106286	106287	106287	I	0	" "
106292	106297	106301	106301	you	308	" remarked Mr. Mason . "
106386	106591	106368	106368	Jane	146	" It was by this time half - past five , and the sun was on the point of rising ; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent . The side- passage door was fastened ; I opened it with as little noise as possible : all the yard was quiet ; but the gates stood wide open , and there was a post - chaise , with horses ready harnessed , and driver seated on the box , stationed outside . I approached him , and said the gentlemen were coming ; he nodded : then I looked carefully round and listened . The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere ; the curtains were yet drawn over the servants ' chamber windows ; little birds were just twittering in the blossom - blanched orchard trees , whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard ; the carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables : all else was still . The gentlemen now appeared . Mason , supported by Mr. Rochester and the surgeon , seemed to walk with tolerable ease : they assisted him into the chaise ; Carter followed . "
106597	106605	106368	106368	Jane	146	" said Mr. Rochester to the latter , "
106642	106643	106634	106634	Richard	308	" "
106652	106653	106650	106650	Fairfax	271	" "
106674	106675	106676	106676	Fairfax	271	" "
106678	106679	106676	106676	Fairfax	271	" "
106685	106686	106688	106688	her	2371	" "
106707	106715	106705	106705	her	2371	" he stopped and burst into tears . "
106731	106749	106716	106716	I	0	" was the answer : he shut up the chaise door , and the vehicle drove away . "
106762	106823	106824	106824	Jane	146	" added Mr. Rochester , as he closed and barred the heavy yard - gates . This done , he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the wall bordering the orchard . I , supposing he had done with me , prepared to return to the house ; again , however , I heard him call "
106826	106841	106824	106824	Jane	146	" He had opened feel portal and stood at it , waiting for me . "
106854	106858	106868	106868	you	146	" he said ; "
106873	106874	106868	106868	you	146	" "
106885	106886	106883	106883	sir	4374	" "
106896	106900	106883	106883	sir	4374	" he answered ; "
106945	106955	107124	107124	Jane	146	" he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered "
106965	107080	107124	107124	Jane	146	" He strayed down a walk edged with box , with apple trees , pear trees , and cherry trees on one side , and a border on the other full of all sorts of old - fashioned flowers , stocks , sweet - williams , primroses , pansies , mingled with southernwood , sweet - briar , and various fragrant herbs . They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams , followed by a lovely spring morning , could make them : the sun was just entering the dappled east , and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them . "
107089	107110	107084	107084	you	146	" He gathered a half - blown rose , the first on the bush , and offered it to me . "
107116	107117	107112	107112	you	4374	" "

107901	107905	107927	107927	you	146	" he said ; "
107935	107954	107933	107933	Jane	146	" I answered him by assuming it : to refuse would , I felt , have been unwise . "

108433	108513	108528	108528	man	4667	" He paused for an answer : and what was I to say ? Oh , for some good spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response ! Vain aspiration ! The west wind whispered in the ivy round me ; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech : the birds sang in the tree - tops ; but their song , however sweet , was inarticulate . Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query : "
108565	108566	108567	108567	Sir	4374	" "
108569	108573	108567	108567	Sir	4374	" I answered , "
108633	108634	108618	108618	him	591	" "
108686	108752	108753	108754	Little friend	2421	" He paused : the birds went on carolling , the leaves lightly rustling . I almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the suspended revelation ; but they would have had to wait many minutes - so long was the silence protracted . At last I looked up at the tardy speaker : he was looking eagerly at me . "
108756	108785	108753	108754	Little friend	2421	" said he , in quite a changed tone - while his face changed too , losing all its softness and gravity , and becoming harsh and sarcastic - "
108812	108839	108840	108840	Jane	146	" He got up instantly , went quite to the other end of the walk , and when he came back he was humming a tune . "
108844	108852	108842	108842	Jane	146	" said he , stopping before me , "
108871	108872	108863	108863	you	146	" "
108880	108881	108878	108878	sir	4374	" "

109066	109088	109089	109089	Mason	337	" As I went one way , he went another , and I heard him in the yard , saying cheerfully - "
109114	109582	109105	109105	I	0	" CHAPTER XXI Presentiments are strange things ! and so are sympathies ; and so are signs ; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key . I never laughed at presentiments in my life , because I have had strange ones of my own . Sympathies , I believe , exist for instance , between far - distant , long - absent , wholly estranged relatives asserting , notwithstanding their alienation , the unity of the source to which each traces his origin whose workings baffle mortal comprehension . And signs , for aught we know , may be but the sympathies of Nature with man . When I was a little girl , only six years old , I one night heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little child ; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble , either to one 's self or one 's kin . The saying might have worn out of my memory , had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there . The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister . Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident ; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant , which I sometimes hushed in my arms , sometimes dandled on my knee , sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn , or again , dabbling its hands in running water . It was a wailing child this night , and a laughing one the next : now it nestled close to me , and now it ran from me ; but whatever mood the apparition evinced , whatever aspect it wore , it failed not for seven successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber . I did not like this iteration of one idea - this strange recurrence of one image , and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near . It was from companionship with this baby - phantom I had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry ; and it was on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax 's room . On repairing thither , I found a man waiting for me , having the appearance of a gentleman 's servant : he was dressed in deep mourning , and the hat he held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band . "
109592	109601	109585	109585	you	2434	" he said , rising as I entered ; "
109632	109633	109627	109627	I	0	" "

109764	109787	109757	109757	I	0	" I said , glancing at his black dress . He too looked down at the crape round his hat and replied - "

110268	110269	110272	110272	Robert	240	" "
110289	110290	110291	110291	I	0	" "

110333	110515	110327	110327	I	0	" and having directed him to the servants ' hall , and recommended him to the care of John 's wife , and the attentions of John himself , I went in search of Mr. Rochester . He was not in any of the lower rooms ; he was not in the yard , the stables , or the grounds . I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him ; - yes : she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram . To the billiard - room I hastened : the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded thence ; Mr. Rochester , Miss Ingram , the two Misses Eshton , and their admirers , were all busied in the game . It required some courage to disturb so interesting a party ; my errand , however , was one I could not defer , so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram 's side . She turned as I drew near , and looked at me haughtily : her eyes seemed to demand , "
110524	110535	110536	110537	Mr. Rochester	251	" and when I said , in a low voice , "
110539	110611	110536	110537	Mr. Rochester	251	" she made a movement as if tempted to order me away . I remember her appearance at the moment - it was very graceful and very striking : she wore a morning robe of sky - blue crape ; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair . She had been all animation with the game , and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty lineaments . "
110618	110633	110613	110614	that person	2462	" she inquired of Mr. Rochester ; and Mr. Rochester turned to see who the "
110635	110663	110536	110537	Mr. Rochester	251	" was . He made a curious grimace - one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations - threw down his cue and followed me from the room . "
110668	110687	110666	110666	Jane	243	" he said , as he rested his back against the schoolroom door , which he had shut . "

111324	111355	111293	111293	you	4374	" He took the purse , poured the hoard into his palm , and chuckled over it as if its scantiness amused him . Soon he produced his pocket- book : "
111358	111387	111293	111293	you	4374	" said he , offering me a note ; it was fifty pounds , and he owed me but fifteen . I told him I had no change . "
111402	111427	111394	111394	you	4374	" I declined accepting more than was my due . He scowled at first ; then , as if recollecting something , he said - "

I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of the first of May : I stepped in there before going up to the hall . It was very clean and neat : the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains ; the floor was spotless ; the grate and fire - irons were burnished bright , and the fire burnt clear . Bessie sat on the hearth , nursing her last - born , and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner . "
112427	112436	112421	112421	I	0	" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven , as I entered . "
112441	112451	112439	112439	Bessie	195	" said I , after I had kissed her ; "

112595	113126	112588	112588	I	0	" Robert here entered , and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and went to welcome him : afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet and having some tea ; for she said I looked pale and tired . I was glad to accept her hospitality ; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child . Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about - setting out the tea - tray with her best china , cutting bread and butter , toasting a tea - cake , and , between whiles , giving little Robert or Jane an occasional tap or push , just as she used to give me in former days . Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good looks . Tea ready , I was going to approach the table ; but she desired me to sit still , quite in her old peremptory tones . I must be served at the fireside , she said ; and she placed before me a little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast , absolutely as she used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair : and I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days . She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall , and what sort of a person the mistress was ; and when I told her there was only a master , whether he was a nice gentleman , and if I liked him . I told her he was rather an ugly man , but quite a gentleman ; and that he treated me kindly , and I was content . Then I went on to describe to her the gay company that had lately been staying at the house ; and to these details Bessie listened with interest : they were precisely of the kind she relished . In such conversation an hour was soon gone : Bessie restored to me my bonnet , c. , and , accompanied by her , I quitted the lodge for the hall . It was also accompanied by her that I had , nearly nine years ago , walked down the path I was now ascending . On a dark , misty , raw morning in January , I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart - a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation - to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood : that bourne so far away and unexplored . The same hostile roof now again rose before me : my prospects were doubtful yet ; and I had yet an aching heart . I still felt as a wanderer on the face of the earth ; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers , and less withering dread of oppression . The gaping wound of my wrongs , too , was now quite healed ; and the flame of resentment extinguished . "
113137	113149	112588	112588	I	0	" said Bessie , as she preceded me through the hall ; "
113157	113540	113541	113542	Miss Eyre	146	" In another moment I was within that apartment . There was every article of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst : the very rug he had stood upon still covered the hearth . Glancing at the bookcases , I thought I could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick 's British Birds occupying their old place on the third shelf , and Gulliver 's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above . The inanimate objects were not changed ; but the living things had altered past recognition . Two young ladies appeared before me ; one very tall , almost as tall as Miss Ingram - very thin too , with a sallow face and severe mien . There was something ascetic in her look , which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a straight - skirted , black , stuff dress , a starched linen collar , hair combed away from the temples , and the nun - like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix . This I felt sure was Eliza , though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and colourless visage . The other was as certainly Georgiana : but not the Georgiana I remembered - the slim and fairy - like girl of eleven . This was a full - blown , very plump damsel , fair as waxwork , with handsome and regular features , languishing blue eyes , and ringleted yellow hair . The hue of her dress was black too ; but its fashion was so different from her sister 's - so much more flowing and becoming - it looked as stylish as the other 's looked puritanical . In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother - and only one ; the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent 's Cairngorm eye : the blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and chin - perhaps a little softened , but still imparting an indescribable hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom . Both ladies , as I advanced , rose to welcome me , and both addressed me by the name of "
113544	113585	113541	113542	Miss Eyre	146	" Eliza 's greeting was delivered in a short , abrupt voice , without a smile ; and then she sat down again , fixed her eyes on the fire , and seemed to forget me . Georgiana added to her "
113590	113663	113541	113542	Miss Eyre	146	" several commonplaces about my journey , the weather , and so on , uttered in rather a drawling tone : and accompanied by sundry side - glances that measured me from head to foot - now traversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse , and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage bonnet . Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they think you a "
113665	113841	113844	113845	Mrs. Reed	156	" without actually saying the words . A certain superciliousness of look , coolness of manner , nonchalance of tone , express fully their sentiments on the point , without committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed . A sneer , however , whether covert or open , had now no longer that power over me it once possessed : as I sat between my cousins , I was surprised to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi - sarcastic attentions of the other - Eliza did not mortify , nor Georgiana ruffle me . The fact was , I had other things to think about ; within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than any they could raise - pains and pleasures so much more acute and exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or bestow - that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad . "
113847	113875	113844	113845	Mrs. Reed	156	" I asked soon , looking calmly at Georgiana , who thought fit to bridle at the direct address , as if it were an unexpected liberty . "
113902	113903	113894	113894	you	4313	" "
113906	113910	113894	113894	you	4313	" said I , "
113931	113946	113947	113947	I	0	" Georgiana almost started , and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide . "
113958	113962	113949	113949	she	156	" I added , "
113978	113979	113980	113980	Mama	260	" "
113988	114224	113980	113980	Mama	260	" remarked Eliza . I soon rose , quietly took off my bonnet and gloves , uninvited , and said I would just step out to Bessie - who was , I dared say , in the kitchen - and ask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to - night . I went , and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand , I proceeded to take further measures . It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance : received as I had been to - day , I should , a year ago , have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning ; now , it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan . I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt , and I must stay with her till she was better - or dead : as to her daughters ' pride or folly , I must put it on one side , make myself independent of it . So I addressed the housekeeper ; asked her to show me a room , told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two , had my trunk conveyed to my chamber , and followed it thither myself : I met Bessie on the landing . "
114229	114233	114225	114225	Missis	178	" said she ; "
114253	114587	114248	114248	she	178	" I did not need to be guided to the well - known room , to which I had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days . I hastened before Bessie ; I softly opened the door : a shaded light stood on the table , for it was now getting dark . There was the great four - post bed with amber hangings as of old ; there the toilet - table , the armchair , and the footstool , at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to kneel , to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted . I looked into a certain corner near , half - expecting to see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there , waiting to leap out imp - like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck . I approached the bed ; I opened the curtains and leant over the high - piled pillows . Well did I remember Mrs. Reed 's face , and I eagerly sought the familiar image . It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion . I had left this woman in bitterness and hate , and I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings , and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries - to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity . The well - known face was there : stern , relentless as ever - there was that peculiar eye which nothing could melt , and the somewhat raised , imperious , despotic eyebrow . How often had it lowered on me menace and hate ! and how the recollection of childhood 's terrors and sorrows revived as I traced its harsh line now ! And yet I stooped down and kissed her : she looked at me . "
114593	114597	114590	114591	Jane Eyre	146	" she said . "
114610	114850	114851	114851	You	2544	" I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again : I thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now . My fingers had fastened on her hand which lay outside the sheet : had she pressed mine kindly , I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure . But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened , nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated . Mrs. Reed took her hand away , and , turning her face rather from me , she remarked that the night was warm . Again she regarded me so icily , I felt at once that her opinion of me - her feeling towards me - was unchanged and unchangeable . I knew by her stony eye - opaque to tenderness , indissoluble to tears - that she was resolved to consider me bad to the last ; because to believe me good would give her no generous pleasure : only a sense of mortification . I felt pain , and then I felt ire ; and then I felt a determination to subdue her - to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will . My tears had risen , just as in childhood : I ordered them back to their source . I brought a chair to the bed - head : I sat down and leaned over the pillow . "
114856	114860	114851	114851	You	2544	" I said , "
114881	114882	114874	114874	I	0	" "
114894	114895	114888	114888	You	2544	" "
114898	114899	114888	114888	You	2544	" "
114956	115006	114947	114947	I	0	" The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous frame . Turning restlessly , she drew the bedclothes round her ; my elbow , resting on a corner of the quilt , fixed it down : she was at once irritated . "
115010	115014	114947	114947	I	0	" said she ; "
115030	115031	115026	115026	you	2546	" "
115037	115038	115034	115035	Jane Eyre	146	" "
115178	115179	115172	115172	I	0	" "
115194	115195	115189	115189	you	156	" "
115587	115594	115595	115595	I	0	" She was getting much excited . "
115604	115620	115597	115597	I	0	" said I to Bessie , who stood on the other side of the bed . "
115644	115648	115640	115640	she	2576	" I rose . "
115651	115656	115670	115670	he	159	" exclaimed Mrs. Reed , "
115735	116229	116249	116249	they	2578	" Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught : she succeeded with difficulty . Soon after , Mrs. Reed grew more composed , and sank into a dozing state . I then left her . More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her . She continued either delirious or lethargic ; and the doctor forbade everything which could painfully excite her . Meantime , I got on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza . They were very cold , indeed , at first . Eliza would sit half the day sewing , reading , or writing , and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister . Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour , and take no notice of me . But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement : I had brought my drawing materials with me , and they served me for both . Provided with a case of pencils , and some sheets of paper , I used to take a seat apart from them , near the window , and busy myself in sketching fancy vignettes , representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in the ever - shifting kaleidoscope of imagination : a glimpse of sea between two rocks ; the rising moon , and a ship crossing its disk ; a group of reeds and water - flags , and a naiad 's head , crowned with lotus - flowers , rising out of them ; an elf sitting in a hedge - sparrow 's nest , under a wreath of hawthorn - bloom . One morning I fell to sketching a face : what sort of a face it was to be , I did not care or know . I took a soft black pencil , gave it a broad point , and worked away . Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage : that contour gave me pleasure ; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features . Strongly - marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow ; then followed , naturally , a well - defined nose , with a straight ridge and full nostrils ; then a flexible- looking mouth , by no means narrow ; then a firm chin , with a decided cleft down the middle of it : of course , some black whiskers were wanted , and some jetty hair , tufted on the temples , and waved above the forehead . Now for the eyes : I had left them to the last , because they required the most careful working . I drew them large ; I shaped them well : the eyelashes I traced long and sombre ; the irids lustrous and large . "
116238	116248	116249	116249	they	2578	" I thought , as I surveyed the effect : "
116256	116325	116249	116249	they	2578	" and I wrought the shades blacker , that the lights might flash more brilliantly - a happy touch or two secured success . There , I had a friend 's face under my gaze ; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me ? I looked at it ; I smiled at the speaking likeness : I was absorbed and content . "
116336	116415	116416	116418	an ugly man	1755	" asked Eliza , who had approached me unnoticed . I responded that it was merely a fancy head , and hurried it beneath the other sheets . Of course , I lied : it was , in fact , a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester . But what was that to her , or to any one but myself ? Georgiana also advanced to look . The other drawings pleased her much , but she called that "
116420	116811	116416	116418	an ugly man	1755	" They both seemed surprised at my skill . I offered to sketch their portraits ; and each , in turn , sat for a pencil outline . Then Georgiana produced her album . I promised to contribute a water - colour drawing : this put her at once into good humour . She proposed a walk in the grounds . Before we had been out two hours , we were deep in a confidential conversation : she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago - of the admiration she had there excited - the attention she had received ; and I even got hints of the titled conquest she had made . In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on : various soft conversations were reported , and sentimental scenes represented ; and , in short , a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit . The communications were renewed from day to day : they always ran on the same theme - herself , her loves , and woes . It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother 's illness , or her brother 's death , or the present gloomy state of the family prospects . Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety , and aspirations after dissipations to come . She passed about five minutes each day in her mother 's sick - room , and no more . Eliza still spoke little : she had evidently no time to talk . I never saw a busier person than she seemed to be ; yet it was difficult to say what she did : or rather , to discover any result of her diligence . She had an alarm to call her up early . I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast , but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions , and each hour had its allotted task . Three times a day she studied a little book , which I found , on inspection , was a Common Prayer Book . I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume , and she said , "
116815	117078	116416	116418	an ugly man	1755	" Three hours she gave to stitching , with gold thread , the border of a square crimson cloth , almost large enough for a carpet . In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article , she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near Gateshead . Two hours she devoted to her diary ; two to working by herself in the kitchen - garden ; and one to the regulation of her accounts . She seemed to want no company ; no conversation . I believe she was happy in her way : this routine sufficed for her ; and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity . She told me one evening , when more disposed to be communicative than usual , that John 's conduct , and the threatened ruin of the family , had been a source of profound affliction to her : but she had now , she said , settled her mind , and formed her resolution . Her own fortune she had taken care to secure ; and when her mother died - and it was wholly improbable , she tranquilly remarked , that she should either recover or linger long - she would execute a long - cherished project : seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance , and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world . I asked if Georgiana would accompany her . "
117124	117173	117116	117116	she	160	" Georgiana , when not unburdening her heart to me , spent most of her time in lying on the sofa , fretting about the dulness of the house , and wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an invitation up to town . "
117181	117185	117116	117116	she	160	" she said , "
117206	117215	117116	117116	she	160	" I did not ask what she meant by "
117220	117292	117293	117293	Georgiana	160	" but I suppose she referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of funeral rites . Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister 's indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring , lounging object had been before her . One day , however , as she put away her account - book and unfolded her embroidery , she suddenly took her up thus - "
117798	117804	117805	117805	You	2584	" She closed her lips . "
117817	117821	117822	117822	Everybody	4413	" answered Georgiana . "
117908	118238	117894	117894	you	2584	" Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards ; Eliza sat cold , impassable , and assiduously industrious . True , generous feeling is made small account of by some , but here were two natures rendered , the one intolerably acrid , the other despicably savourless for the want of it . Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed ; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition . It was a wet and windy afternoon : Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa over the perusal of a novel ; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's - day service at the new church - for in matters of religion she was a rigid formalist : no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she considered her devotional duties ; fair or foul , she went to church thrice every Sunday , and as often on week - days as there were prayers . I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped , who lay there almost unheeded : the very servants paid her but a remittent attention : the hired nurse , being little looked after , would slip out of the room whenever she could . Bessie was faithful ; but she had her own family to mind , and could only come occasionally to the hall . I found the sick - room unwatched , as I had expected : no nurse was there ; the patient lay still , and seemingly lethargic ; her livid face sunk in the pillows : the fire was dying in the grate . I renewed the fuel , re - arranged the bedclothes , gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on me , and then I moved away to the window . The rain beat strongly against the panes , the wind blew tempestuously : "
118243	118247	118239	118239	One	358	" I thought , "
118278	118368	118406	118406	I	0	" In pondering the great mystery , I thought of Helen Burns , recalled her dying words - her faith - her doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls . I was still listening in thought to her well - remembered tones - still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect , her wasted face and sublime gaze , as she lay on her placid deathbed , and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine Father 's bosom - when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind : "
118373	118394	118406	118406	I	0	" I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days : was she reviving ? I went up to her . "
118402	118403	118406	118406	I	0	" "
118408	118413	118406	118406	I	0	" was her answer . "
118418	118435	118416	118416	you	0	" looking at me with surprise and a sort of alarm , but still not wildly . "
118448	118449	118446	118446	Bessie	195	" "
118458	118459	118460	118460	Aunt	2610	" "
118462	118466	118460	118460	Aunt	2610	" she repeated . "
118513	118530	118507	118507	you	0	" I said nothing : I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my identity . "
118533	118537	118507	118507	you	0	" said she , "
118578	118626	118572	118572	she	146	" I now gently assured her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be : and seeing that I was understood , and that her senses were quite collected , I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield . "
118635	118641	118632	118632	I	0	" she said ere long . "
118712	118720	118697	118698	the nurse	510	" I assured her we were alone . "
118758	118762	118735	118735	One	4415	" she stopped . "
118775	118781	118735	118735	One	4415	" she murmured to herself : "
118799	118834	118852	118852	her	2623	" She made an effort to alter her position , but failed : her face changed ; she seemed to experience some inward sensation - the precursor , perhaps , of the last pang . "
118875	118881	118902	118902	you	4457	" I obeyed her directions . "
118886	118897	118898	118898	Madam	4457	" she said . It was short , and thus conceived:- "
118993	118999	118987	118987	Madam	4457	" JOHN EYRE , Madeira . "
119007	119016	119017	119017	I	0	" Why did I never hear of this ? "
119020	119170	119017	119017	I	0	" Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in lifting you to prosperity . I could not forget your conduct to me , Jane - the fury with which you once turned on me ; the tone in which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world ; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick , and asserted that I had treated you with miserable cruelty . I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind : I felt fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in a man 's voice . - Bring me some water ! Oh , make haste ! "
119171	119176	119178	119178	I	0	" Dear Mrs. Reed , "
119189	119228	119178	119178	I	0	" think no more of all this , let it pass away from your mind . Forgive me for my passionate language : I was a child then ; eight , nine years have passed since that day . "
119253	119383	119248	119248	she	2627	" I tell you I could not forget it ; and I took my revenge : for you to be adopted by your uncle , and placed in a state of ease and comfort , was what I could not endure . I wrote to him ; I said I was sorry for his disappointment , but Jane Eyre was dead : she had died of typhus fever at Lowood . Now act as you please : write and contradict my assertion - expose my falsehood as soon as you like . You were born , I think , to be my torment : my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which , but for you , I should never have been tempted to commit . "
119384	119408	119539	119539	She	2628	" If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it , aunt , and to regard me with kindness and forgiveness "
119409	119417	119419	119419	she	2628	" You have a very bad disposition , "
119421	119464	119419	119419	she	2628	" and one to this day I feel it impossible to understand : how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent under any treatment , and in the tenth break out all fire and violence , I can never comprehend . "
119465	119524	119525	119525	I	0	" My disposition is not so bad as you think : I am passionate , but not vindictive . Many a time , as a little child , I should have been glad to love you if you would have let me ; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now : kiss me , aunt . "
119602	119616	119617	119617	I	0	" Love me , then , or hate me , as you will , "
119622	119642	119617	119617	I	0	" you have my full and free forgiveness : ask now for God 's , and be at peace . "
119920	119941	119917	119917	she	158	" With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age : her life was shortened by trouble . "
120134	120252	120124	120124	she	160	" If you and I were destined to live always together , cousin , we would commence matters on a different footing . I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party ; I should assign you your share of labour , and compel you to accomplish it , or else it should be left undone : I should insist , also , on your keeping some of those drawling , half - insincere complaints hushed in your own breast . It is only because our connection happens to be very transitory , and comes at a peculiarly mournful season , that I consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part . "
120359	120362	120363	120363	she	160	" And , "
120366	120412	120413	120413	she	160	" I am obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct ! There is some difference between living with such an one as you and with Georgiana : you perform your own part in life and burden no one . To - morrow , "
120416	120523	120413	120413	she	160	" I set out for the Continent . I shall take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle - a nunnery you would call it ; there I shall be quiet and unmolested . I shall devote myself for a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas , and to a careful study of the workings of their system : if I find it to be , as I half suspect it is , the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in order , I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil . "
120539	120549	120550	120550	I	0	" The vocation will fit you to a hair , "
120553	120561	120550	120550	I	0	" much good may it do you ! "
120569	120588	120566	120566	she	160	" Good - bye , cousin Jane Eyre ; I wish you well : you have some sense . "
120593	120644	120589	120589	I	0	" You are not without sense , cousin Eliza ; but what you have , I suppose , in another year will be walled up alive in a French convent . However , it is not my business , and so it suits you , I do n't much care . "
120645	120652	120654	120654	she	160	" You are in the right , "
121174	121186	121188	121188	my	0	" You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it , "
121192	121199	121188	121188	my	0	" I do n't doubt it . "
121204	121211	121188	121188	my	0	" Where was I to go ? "
121528	121542	121544	121544	I	0	" Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome , to be sure , "
121546	121582	121544	121544	I	0	" and little Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you : but you know very well you are thinking of another than they , and that he is not thinking of you . "
121627	121659	121624	121624	they	2684	" Hasten ! hasten ! be with him while you may : but a few more days or weeks , at most , and you are parted from him for ever ! "
121925	121928	121929	121929	he	251	" Hillo ! "
121942	121954	121933	121933	he	251	" There you are ! Come on , if you please . "
122039	122119	122028	122028	I	0	" And this is Jane Eyre ? Are you coming from Millcote , and on foot ? Yes - just one of your tricks : not to send for a carriage , and come clattering over street and road like a common mortal , but to steal into the vicinage of your home along with twilight , just as if you were a dream or a shade . What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month ? "
122120	122134	122227	122227	he	2694	" I have been with my aunt , sir , who is dead . "
122135	122222	122223	122223	he	2694	" A true Janian reply ! Good angels be my guard ! She comes from the other world - from the abode of people who are dead ; and tells me so when she meets me alone here in the gloaming ! If I dared , I 'd touch you , to see if you are substance or shadow , you elf ! - but I 'd as soon offer to take hold of a blue ignis fatuus light in a marsh . Truant ! truant ! "
122233	122251	122223	122223	he	2694	" Absent from me a whole month , and forgetting me quite , I 'll be sworn ! "
122405	122419	122394	122394	I	0	" Yes ; I suppose you found that out by second - sight . "
122420	122429	122361	122361	he	2694	" Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter . "
122430	122442	122361	122361	he	2694	" And did she inform you what I went to do ? "
122443	122455	122361	122361	he	2694	" Oh , yes , sir ! Everybody knew your errand . "
122456	122548	122361	122361	he	2694	" You must see the carriage , Jane , and tell me if you do n't think it will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly ; and whether she wo n't look like Queen Boadicea , leaning back against those purple cushions . I wish , Jane , I were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally . Tell me now , fairy as you are - ca n't you give me a charm , or a philter , or something of that sort , to make me a handsome man ? "
122549	122561	122567	122567	I	0	" It would be past the power of magic , sir ; "
122570	122597	122567	122567	I	0	" A loving eye is all the charm needed : to such you are handsome enough ; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty . "
122677	122682	122684	122684	he	251	" Pass , Janet , "
122695	122713	122684	122684	he	251	" go up home , and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend 's threshold . "
122780	122815	122763	122763	I	0	" Thank you , Mr. Rochester , for your great kindness . I am strangely glad to get back again to you : and wherever you are is my home - my only home . "

123592	123600	123572	123572	I	0	" Day its fervid fires had wasted , "
124196	124206	124208	124208	I	0	" Now , he has his back towards me , "
124210	124230	124208	124208	I	0	" and he is occupied too ; perhaps , if I walk softly , I can slip away unnoticed . "
124275	124283	124284	124284	I	0	" I shall get by very well , "
124314	124324	124307	124307	he	251	" Jane , come and look at this fellow . "
124353	124359	124361	124361	he	251	" Look at his wings , "
124363	124396	124361	124361	he	251	" he reminds me rather of a West Indian insect ; one does not often see so large and gay a night - rover in England ; there ! he is flown . "
124424	124462	124421	124421	he	251	" Turn back : on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house ; and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise . "
124614	124617	124618	124618	he	251	" Jane , "
124645	124658	124618	124618	he	251	" Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer , is it not ? "
124659	124664	124618	124618	he	251	" Yes , sir . "
124665	124699	124618	124618	he	251	" You must have become in some degree attached to the house , - you , who have an eye for natural beauties , and a good deal of the organ of Adhesiveness ? "
124700	124709	124618	124618	he	251	" I am attached to it , indeed . "
124710	124746	124618	124618	he	251	" And though I do n't comprehend how it is , I perceive you have acquired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele , too ; and even for simple dame Fairfax ? "
124747	124763	124618	124618	he	251	" Yes , sir ; in different ways , I have an affection for both . "
124764	124774	124618	124618	he	251	" And would be sorry to part with them ? "
124775	124778	124618	124618	he	251	" Yes . "
124779	124782	124783	124783	he	251	" Pity ! "
124791	124803	124804	124804	he	251	" It is always the way of events in this life , "
124808	124843	124804	124804	he	251	" no sooner have you got settled in a pleasant resting - place , than a voice calls out to you to rise and move on , for the hour of repose is expired . "
124844	124852	124853	124853	I	0	" Must I move on , sir ? "
124856	124862	124853	124853	I	0	" Must I leave Thornfield ? "
124863	124884	124804	124804	he	251	" I believe you must , Jane . I am sorry , Janet , but I believe indeed you must . "
124899	124915	124891	124891	I	0	" Well , sir , I shall be ready when the order to march comes . "
124916	124930	124853	124853	I	0	" It is come now - I must give it to - night . "
124931	124942	124853	124853	I	0	" Then you ARE going to be married , sir ? "
124943	124971	124891	124891	I	0	" Ex - act - ly - pre - cise - ly : with your usual acuteness , you have hit the nail straight on the head . "
124972	124977	124853	124853	I	0	" Soon , sir ? "
124978	125250	124853	124853	I	0	" Very soon , my - that is , Miss Eyre : and you 'll remember , Jane , the first time I , or Rumour , plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to put my old bachelor 's neck into the sacred noose , to enter into the holy estate of matrimony - to take Miss Ingram to my bosom , in short she 's an extensive armful : but that 's not to the point - one ca n't have too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche : well , as I was saying - listen to me , Jane ! You 're not turning your head to look after more moths , are you ? That was only a lady - clock , child , ' flying away home . ' I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me , with that discretion I respect in you - with that foresight , prudence , and humility which befit your responsible and dependent position - that in case I married Miss Ingram , both you and little Adele had better trot forthwith . I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my beloved ; indeed , when you are far away , Janet , I 'll try to forget it : I shall notice only its wisdom ; which is such that I have made it my law of action . Adele must go to school ; and you , Miss Eyre , must get a new situation . "
125251	125267	125268	125268	I	0	" Yes , sir , I will advertise immediately : and meantime , I suppose - "
125274	125292	125268	125268	I	0	" I suppose I may stay here , till I find another shelter to betake myself to : "
125317	125329	125331	125332	Mr. Rochester	251	" In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom , "
125334	125353	125331	125332	Mr. Rochester	251	" and in the interim , I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you . "
125354	125366	124853	124853	I	0	" Thank you , sir ; I am sorry to give - "
125367	125477	125331	125332	Mr. Rochester	251	" Oh , no need to apologise ! I consider that when a dependent does her duty as well as you have done yours , she has a sort of claim upon her employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her ; indeed I have already , through my future mother - in - law , heard of a place that I think will suit : it is to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge , Connaught , Ireland . You 'll like Ireland , I think : they 're such warm - hearted people there , they say . "
125478	125488	125331	125332	Mr. Rochester	251	" It is a long way off , sir . "
125489	125508	124853	124853	I	0	" No matter - a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance . "
125509	125526	125331	125332	Mr. Rochester	251	" Not the voyage , but the distance : and then the sea is a barrier - "
125527	125533	125331	125332	Mr. Rochester	251	" From what , Jane ? "
125534	125543	124853	124853	I	0	" From England and from Thornfield : and - "
125544	125547	125331	125332	Mr. Rochester	251	" Well ? "
125548	125554	125555	125555	I	0	" From YOU , sir . "
125662	125669	125670	125670	I	0	" It is a long way , "
125674	125738	125670	125670	I	0	" It is , to be sure ; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge , Connaught , Ireland , I shall never see you again , Jane : that 's morally certain . I never go over to Ireland , not having myself much of a fancy for the country . We have been good friends , Jane ; have we not ? "
125739	125744	125845	125845	He	2747	" Yes , sir . "
125745	125844	125845	125845	He	2747	" And when friends are on the eve of separation , they like to spend the little time that remains to them close to each other . Come ! we 'll talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half - an - hour or so , while the stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder : here is the chestnut tree : here is the bench at its old roots . Come , we will sit there in peace to - night , though we should never more be destined to sit there together . "
125851	125904	125845	125845	He	2747	" It is a long way to Ireland , Janet , and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels : but if I ca n't do better , how is it to be helped ? Are you anything akin to me , do you think , Jane ? "
125921	125924	125925	125925	he	2747	" Because , "
125928	126036	125925	125925	he	2747	" I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you - especially when you are near me , as now : it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs , tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame . And if that boisterous Channel , and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us , I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt ; and then I 've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly . As for you , - you 'd forget me . "
126037	126048	125925	125925	he	2747	" That I NEVER should , sir : You know - "
126053	126068	125925	125925	he	2747	" Jane , do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood ? Listen ! "
126130	126139	126105	126105	I	0	" Because you are sorry to leave it ? "
126190	126336	126892	126892	him	2749	" I grieve to leave Thornfield : I love Thornfield:- I love it , because I have lived in it a full and delightful life , - momentarily at least . I have not been trampled on . I have not been petrified . I have not been buried with inferior minds , and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high . I have talked , face to face , with what I reverence , with what I delight in , - with an original , a vigorous , an expanded mind . I have known you , Mr. Rochester ; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever . I see the necessity of departure ; and it is like looking on the necessity of death . "
126337	126345	126346	126346	he	2748	" Where do you see the necessity ? "
126350	126363	126346	126346	he	2748	" Where ? You , sir , have placed it before me . "
126364	126369	126892	126892	him	2749	" In what shape ? "
126370	126388	126892	126892	him	2749	" In the shape of Miss Ingram ; a noble and beautiful woman , - your bride . "
126389	126401	126892	126892	him	2749	" My bride ! What bride ? I have no bride ! "
126402	126408	126892	126892	him	2749	" But you will have . "
126409	126420	126421	126421	He	2748	" Yes ; - I will ! - I will ! "
126426	126437	126421	126421	He	2748	" Then I must go:- you have said it yourself . "
126438	126456	126892	126892	him	2749	" No : you must stay ! I swear it - and the oath shall be kept . "
126457	126465	126466	126466	I	0	" I tell you I must go ! "
126475	126661	126892	126892	him	2749	" Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you ? Do you think I am an automaton ? - a machine without feelings ? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips , and my drop of living water dashed from my cup ? Do you think , because I am poor , obscure , plain , and little , I am soulless and heartless ? You think wrong ! - I have as much soul as you , - and full as much heart ! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth , I should have made it as hard for you to leave me , as it is now for me to leave you . I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom , conventionalities , nor even of mortal flesh ; - it is my spirit that addresses your spirit ; just as if both had passed through the grave , and we stood at God 's feet , equal , - as we are ! "
126662	126667	126669	126670	Mr. Rochester	251	" As we are ! "
126675	126703	126669	126670	Mr. Rochester	251	" he added , enclosing me in his arms . Gathering me to his breast , pressing his lips on my lips : ' so , Jane ! "
126704	126711	126712	126712	I	0	" Yes , so , sir , "
126715	126792	126712	126712	I	0	" and yet not so ; for you are a married man - or as good as a married man , and we d to one inferior to you - to one with whom you have no sympathy - whom I do not believe you truly love ; for I have seen and heard you sneer at her . I would scorn such a union : therefore I am better than you - let me go ! "
126793	126801	126669	126670	Mr. Rochester	251	" Where , Jane ? To Ireland ? "
126802	126820	126669	126670	Mr. Rochester	251	" Yes - to Ireland . I have spoken my mind , and can go anywhere now . "
126821	126847	126669	126670	Mr. Rochester	251	" Jane , be still ; do n't struggle so , like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation . "
126848	126879	126669	126670	Mr. Rochester	251	" I am no bird ; and no net ensnares me ; I am a free human being with an independent will , which I now exert to leave you . "
126894	126903	126904	126904	he	2749	" And your will shall decide your destiny , "
126907	126925	126904	126904	he	2749	" I offer you my hand , my heart , and a share of all my possessions . "
126926	126938	126669	126670	Mr. Rochester	251	" You play a farce , which I merely laugh at . "
126939	126962	126669	126670	Mr. Rochester	251	" I ask you to pass through life at my side - to be my second self , and best earthly companion . "
126963	126980	126904	126904	he	2749	" For that fate you have already made your choice , and must abide by it . "
126981	127002	126669	126670	Mr. Rochester	251	" Jane , be still a few moments : you are over - excited : I will be still too . "
127084	127101	127079	127079	he	251	" Come to my side , Jane , and let us explain and understand one another . "
127102	127123	127079	127079	he	251	" I will never again come to your side : I am torn away now , and can not return . "
127124	127145	127146	127146	I	0	" But , Jane , I summon you as my wife : it is you only I intend to marry . "
127156	127164	127152	127152	he	251	" Come , Jane - come hither . "
127165	127172	127173	127173	He	251	" Your bride stands between us . "
127183	127189	127190	127190	he	251	" My bride is here , "
127199	127217	127190	127190	he	251	" because my equal is here , and my likeness . Jane , will you marry me ? "
127239	127247	127234	127234	I	0	" Do you doubt me , Jane ? "
127248	127251	127230	127230	his	251	" Entirely . "
127252	127260	127234	127234	I	0	" You have no faith in me ? "
127261	127266	127234	127234	I	0	" Not a whit . "
127267	127276	127277	127277	he	251	" Am I a liar in your eyes ? "
127281	127415	127277	127277	he	251	" Little sceptic , you SHALL be convinced . What love have I for Miss Ingram ? None : and that you know . What love has she for me ? None : as I have taken pains to prove : I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed , and after that I presented myself to see the result ; it was coldness both from her and her mother . I would not - I could not - marry Miss Ingram . You - you strange , you almost unearthly thing ! - I love as my own flesh . You - poor and obscure , and small and plain as you are - I entreat to accept me as a husband . "
127416	127421	127422	127422	I	0	" What , me ! "
127441	127470	127422	127422	I	0	" me who have not a friend in the world but you - if you are my friend : not a shilling but what you have given me ? "
127471	127498	127277	127277	he	251	" You , Jane , I must have you for my own - entirely my own . Will you be mine ? Say yes , quickly . "
127499	127515	127277	127277	he	251	" Mr. Rochester , let me look at your face : turn to the moonlight . "
127516	127519	127277	127277	he	251	" Why ? "
127520	127531	127277	127277	he	251	" Because I want to read your countenance - turn ! "
127532	127560	127561	127561	His	2752	" There ! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled , scratched page . Read on : only make haste , for I suffer . "
127587	127596	127597	127597	he	2752	" Oh , Jane , you torture me ! "
127600	127615	127597	127597	he	2752	" With that searching and yet faithful and generous look , you torture me ! "
127616	127649	127277	127277	he	251	" How can I do that ? If you are true , and your offer real , my only feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion - they can not torture . "
127650	127653	127654	127654	he	2752	" Gratitude ! "
127661	127683	127654	127654	he	2752	" Jane accept me quickly . Say , Edward - give me my name - Edward - I will marry you . "
127684	127706	127277	127277	he	251	" Are you in earnest ? Do you truly love me ? Do you sincerely wish me to be your wife ? "
127707	127725	127277	127277	he	251	" I do ; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you , I swear it . "
127726	127736	127654	127654	he	2752	" Then , sir , I will marry you . "
127737	127744	127277	127277	he	251	" Edward - my little wife ! "
127745	127749	127277	127277	he	251	" Dear Edward ! "
127750	127761	127763	127763	he	2753	" Come to me - come to me entirely now , "
127785	127795	127769	127769	his	2753	" Make my happiness - I will make yours . "
127796	127801	127277	127277	he	251	" God pardon me ! "
127807	127824	127802	127802	he	2753	" and man meddle not with me : I have her , and will hold her . "
127825	127842	127769	127769	his	2753	" There is no one to meddle , sir . I have no kindred to interfere . "
127843	127853	127854	127854	he	2753	" No - that is the best of it , "
127918	127925	127915	127915	he	2753	" Are you happy , Jane ? "
127933	127936	127930	127930	I	0	" Yes . "
127942	128028	127939	127939	he	2753	" It will atone - it will atone . Have I not found her friendless , and cold , and comfortless ? Will I not guard , and cherish , and solace her ? Is there not love in my heart , and constancy in my resolves ? It will expiate at God 's tribunal . I know my Maker sanctions what I do . For the world 's judgment - I wash my hands thereof . For man 's opinion - I defy it . "
128090	128096	128098	128099	Mr. Rochester	251	" We must go in , "
128101	128117	128098	128099	Mr. Rochester	251	" the weather changes . I could have sat with thee till morning , Jane . "
128118	128122	128124	128124	I	0	" And so , "
128126	128132	128124	128124	I	0	" could I with you . "
128276	128285	128287	128287	he	251	" Hasten to take off your wet things , "
128289	128306	128287	128287	he	251	" and before you go , good - night - good - night , my darling ! "
128344	128352	128354	128354	I.	0	" Explanation will do for another time , "
128861	128871	128842	128843	Mrs. Fairfax	180	" Miss Eyre , will you come to breakfast ? "
128923	128935	128918	128918	Adele	259	" Where are you going ? It is time for lessons . "
128936	128947	128916	128916	I	0	" Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery . "
128948	128953	128918	128918	Adele	259	" Where is he ? "
128954	128958	128918	128918	Adele	259	" In there , "
128977	128986	128988	128988	he	4336	" Come and bid me good - morning , "
129040	129053	129055	129055	he	4336	" Jane , you look blooming , and smiling , and pretty , "
129057	129105	129055	129055	he	4336	" truly pretty this morning . Is this my pale , little elf ? Is this my mustard - seed ? This little sunny - faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips ; the satin - smooth hazel hair , and the radiant hazel eyes ? "
129131	129139	129128	129128	I	0	" It is Jane Eyre , sir . "
129140	129147	129148	129148	he	4336	" Soon to be Jane Rochester , "
129151	129168	129148	129148	he	4336	" in four weeks , Janet ; not a day more . Do you hear that ? "
129217	129234	129212	129212	I	0	" You blushed , and now you are white , Jane : what is that for ? "
129235	129253	129631	129631	he	2777	" Because you gave me a new name - Jane Rochester ; and it seems so strange . "
129254	129260	129262	129262	he	4336	" Yes , Mrs. Rochester , "
129264	129276	129262	129262	he	4336	" young Mrs. Rochester - Fairfax Rochester 's girl - bride . "
129277	129333	129212	129212	I	0	" It can never be , sir ; it does not sound likely . Human beings never enjoy complete happiness in this world . I was not born for a different destiny to the rest of my species : to imagine such a lot befalling me is a fairy tale - a day - dream . "
129334	129415	129212	129212	I	0	" Which I can and will realise . I shall begin to - day . This morning I wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his keeping , - heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield . In a day or two I hope to pour them into your lap : for every privilege , every attention shall be yours that I would accord a peer 's daughter , if about to marry her . "
129416	129452	129262	129262	he	4336	" Oh , sir ! - never rain jewels ! I do n't like to hear them spoken of . Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange : I would rather not have them . "
129453	129517	129212	129212	I	0	" I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck , and the circlet on your forehead , - which it will become : for nature , at least , has stamped her patent of nobility on this brow , Jane ; and I will clasp the bracelets on these fine wrists , and load these fairy - like fingers with rings . "
129518	129560	129212	129212	I	0	" No , no , sir ! think of other subjects , and speak of other things , and in another strain . Do n't address me as if I were a beauty ; I am your plain , Quakerish governess . "
129561	129586	129262	129262	he	4336	" You are a beauty in my eyes , and a beauty just after the desire of my heart , - delicate and aerial . "
129587	129616	129212	129212	I	0	" Puny and insignificant , you mean . You are dreaming , sir , - or you are sneering . For God 's sake do n't be ironical ! "
129617	129630	129631	129631	he	2777	" I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty , too , "
129661	129695	129650	129650	he	2777	" I will attire my Jane in satin and lace , and she shall have roses in her hair ; and I will cover the head I love best with a priceless veil . "
129696	129790	129791	129791	He	2778	" And then you wo n't know me , sir ; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any longer , but an ape in a harlequin 's jacket - a jay in borrowed plumes . I would as soon see you , Mr. Rochester , tricked out in stage - trappings , as myself clad in a court - lady 's robe ; and I do n't call you handsome , sir , though I love you most dearly : far too dearly to flatter you . Do n't flatter me . "
129803	129928	129791	129791	He	2778	" This very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote , and you must choose some dresses for yourself . I told you we shall be married in four weeks . The wedding is to take place quietly , in the church down below yonder ; and then I shall waft you away at once to town . After a brief stay there , I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun : to French vineyards and Italian plains ; and she shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record : she shall taste , too , of the life of cities ; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others . "
129929	129941	129650	129650	he	2777	" Shall I travel ? - and with you , sir ? "
129942	130030	130031	130031	I	0	" You shall sojourn at Paris , Rome , and Naples : at Florence , Venice , and Vienna : all the ground I have wandered over shall be re - trodden by you : wherever I stamped my hoof , your sylph 's foot shall step also . Ten years since , I flew through Europe half mad ; with disgust , hate , and rage as my companions : now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed , with a very angel as my comforter . "
130040	130047	130048	130048	I	0	" I am not an angel , "
130051	130106	130048	130048	I	0	" and I will not be one till I die : I will be myself . Mr. Rochester , you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me - for you will not get it , any more than I shall get it of you : which I do not at all anticipate . "
130107	130115	129650	129650	he	2777	" What do you anticipate of me ? "
130116	130253	129650	129650	he	2777	" For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now , - a very little while ; and then you will turn cool ; and then you will be capricious ; and then you will be stern , and I shall have much ado to please you : but when you get well used to me , you will perhaps like me again , - LIKE me , I say , not LOVE me . I suppose your love will effervesce in six months , or less . I have observed in books written by men , that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband 's ardour extends . Yet , after all , as a friend and companion , I hope never to become quite distasteful to my dear master . "
130254	130297	129650	129650	he	2777	" Distasteful ! and like you again ! I think I shall like you again , and yet again : and I will make you confess I do not only LIKE , but LOVE you - with truth , fervour , constancy . "
130298	130307	129650	129650	he	2777	" Yet are you not capricious , sir ? "
130308	130401	129650	129650	he	2777	" To women who please me only by their faces , I am the very devil when I find out they have neither souls nor hearts - when they open to me a perspective of flatness , triviality , and perhaps imbecility , coarseness , and ill - temper : but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue , to the soul made of fire , and the character that bends but does not break - at once supple and stable , tractable and consistent - I am ever tender and true . "
130402	130422	129650	129650	he	2777	" Had you ever experience of such a character , sir ? Did you ever love such an one ? "
130423	130429	129650	129650	he	2777	" I love it now . "
130430	130450	129650	129650	he	2777	" But before me : if I , indeed , in any respect come up to your difficult standard ? "
130451	130559	129650	129650	he	2777	" I never met your likeness . Jane , you please me , and you master me - you seem to submit , and I like the sense of pliancy you impart ; and while I am twining the soft , silken skein round my finger , it sends a thrill up my arm to my heart . I am influenced - conquered ; and the influence is sweeter than I can express ; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery beyond any triumph I can win . Why do you smile , Jane ? What does that inexplicable , that uncanny turn of countenance mean ? "
130560	130587	129650	129650	he	2777	" I was thinking , sir you will excuse the idea ; it was involuntary , I was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers - "
130588	130596	129650	129650	he	2777	" You were , you little elfish - "
130597	130680	129650	129650	he	2777	" Hush , sir ! You do n't talk very wisely just now ; any more than those gentlemen acted very wisely . However , had they been married , they would no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as suitors ; and so will you , I fear . I wonder how you will answer me a year hence , should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or pleasure to grant . "
130681	130700	129650	129650	he	2777	" Ask me something now , Jane , - the least thing : I desire to be entreated - "
130701	130715	129650	129650	he	2777	" Indeed I will , sir ; I have my petition all ready . "
130716	130749	129650	129650	he	2777	" Speak ! But if you look up and smile with that countenance , I shall swear concession before I know to what , and that will make a fool of me . "
130750	130796	129650	129650	he	2777	" Not at all , sir ; I ask only this : do n't send for the jewels , and do n't crown me with roses : you might as well put a border of gold lace round that plain pocket handkerchief you have there . "
130797	130854	129650	129650	he	2777	" I might as well ' gild refined gold . ' I know it : your request is granted then - for the time . I will remand the order I despatched to my banker . But you have not yet asked for anything ; you have prayed a gift to be withdrawn : try again . "
130855	130877	130878	130878	He	2780	" Well then , sir , have the goodness to gratify my curiosity , which is much piqued on one point . "
130882	130887	130888	130888	he	2780	" What ? what ? "
130892	130913	130888	130888	he	2780	" Curiosity is a dangerous petition : it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every request - "
130914	130928	129650	129650	he	2777	" But there can be no danger in complying with this , sir . "
130929	130960	129650	129650	he	2777	" Utter it , Jane : but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into , perhaps , a secret , it was a wish for half my estate . "
130961	131017	129650	129650	he	2777	" Now , King Ahasuerus ! What do I want with half your estate ? Do you think I am a Jew - usurer , seeking good investment in land ? I would much rather have all your confidence . You will not exclude me from your confidence if you admit me to your heart ? "
131018	131063	129650	129650	he	2777	" You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having , Jane ; but for God 's sake , do n't desire a useless burden ! Do n't long for poison - do n't turn out a downright Eve on my hands ! "
131064	131133	129650	129650	he	2777	" Why not , sir ? You have just been telling me how much you liked to be conquered , and how pleasant over - persuasion is to you . Do n't you think I had better take advantage of the confession , and begin and coax and entreat - even cry and be sulky if necessary - for the sake of a mere essay of my power ? "
131134	131153	129650	129650	he	2777	" I dare you to any such experiment . Encroach , presume , and the game is up . "
131154	131218	129650	129650	he	2777	" Is it , sir ? You soon give in . How stern you look now ! Your eyebrows have become as thick as my finger , and your forehead resembles what , in some very astonishing poetry , I once saw styled , ' a blue - piled thunderloft . ' That will be your married look , sir , I suppose ? "
131219	131263	129650	129650	he	2777	" If that will be YOUR married look , I , as a Christian , will soon give up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander . But what had you to ask , thing , - out with it ? "
131264	131321	129650	129650	he	2777	" There , you are less than civil now ; and I like rudeness a great deal better than flattery . I had rather be a THING than an angel . This is what I have to ask , - Why did you take such pains to make me believe you wished to marry Miss Ingram ? "
131322	131334	129650	129650	he	2777	" Is that all ? Thank God it is no worse ! "
131365	131372	131373	131373	he	2781	" I think I may confess , "
131376	131446	131373	131373	he	2781	" even although I should make you a little indignant , Jane - and I have seen what a fire - spirit you can be when you are indignant . You glowed in the cool moonlight last night , when you mutinied against fate , and claimed your rank as my equal . Janet , by - the - bye , it was you who made me the offer . "
131447	131466	129650	129650	he	2777	" Of course I did . But to the point if you please , sir - Miss Ingram ? "
131467	131515	129650	129650	he	2777	" Well , I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram , because I wished to render you as madly in love with me as I was with you ; and I knew jealousy would be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end . "
131516	131563	131373	131373	he	2781	" Excellent ! Now you are small - not one whit bigger than the end of my little finger . It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act in that way . Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram 's feelings , sir ? "
131564	131585	129650	129650	he	2777	" Her feelings are concentrated in one - pride ; and that needs humbling . Were you jealous , Jane ? "
131586	131632	129650	129650	he	2777	" Never mind , Mr. Rochester : it is in no way interesting to you to know that . Answer me truly once more . Do you think Miss Ingram will not suffer from your dishonest coquetry ? Wo n't she feel forsaken and deserted ? "
131633	131668	131373	131373	he	2781	" Impossible ! - when I told you how she , on the contrary , deserted me : the idea of my insolvency cooled , or rather extinguished , her flame in a moment . "
131669	131692	129650	129650	he	2777	" You have a curious , designing mind , Mr. Rochester . I am afraid your principles on some points are eccentric . "
131693	131714	129650	129650	he	2777	" My principles were never trained , Jane : they may have grown a little awry for want of attention . "
131715	131752	131373	131373	he	2781	" Once again , seriously ; may I enjoy the great good that has been vouchsafed to me , without fearing that any one else is suffering the bitter pain I myself felt a while ago ? "
131753	131799	131800	131800	I	0	" That you may , my good little girl : there is not another being in the world has the same pure love for me as yourself - for I lay that pleasant unction to my soul , Jane , a belief in your affection . "
131836	131841	131842	131842	he	2782	" Ask something more , "
131846	131859	131842	131842	he	2782	" it is my delight to be entreated , and to yield . "
131868	131916	131860	131860	I	0	" Communicate your intentions to Mrs. Fairfax , sir : she saw me with you last night in the hall , and she was shocked . Give her some explanation before I see her again . It pains me to be misjudged by so good a woman . "
131917	131929	131930	131930	he	2782	" Go to your room , and put on your bonnet , "
131933	131982	131930	131930	he	2782	" I mean you to accompany me to Millcote this morning ; and while you prepare for the drive , I will enlighten the old lady 's understanding . Did she think , Janet , you had given the world for love , and considered it well lost ? "
131983	131999	132055	132057	The old lady	1406	" I believe she thought I had forgotten my station , and yours , sir . "
132000	132031	132032	132032	I	0	" Station ! station ! - your station is in my heart , and on the necks of those who would insult you , now or hereafter . - Go . "
132179	132185	132186	132186	she	1406	" I feel so astonished , "
132189	132338	132186	132186	she	1406	" I hardly know what to say to you , Miss Eyre . I have surely not been dreaming , have I ? Sometimes I half fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never happened . It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze , that my dear husband , who died fifteen years since , has come in and sat down beside me ; and that I have even heard him call me by my name , Alice , as he used to do . Now , can you tell me whether it is actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him ? Do n't laugh at me . But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago , and said that in a month you would be his wife . "
132339	132349	132350	132350	I	0	" He has said the same thing to me , "
132353	132367	132350	132350	I	0	" He has ! Do you believe him ? Have you accepted him ? "
132368	132371	132372	132372	She	2785	" Yes . "
132378	132424	132372	132372	She	2785	" I could never have thought it . He is a proud man : all the Rochesters were proud : and his father , at least , liked money . He , too , has always been called careful . He means to marry you ? "
132425	132431	132432	132432	She	2785	" He tells me so . "
132457	132462	132463	132463	she	2785	" It passes me ! "
132466	132525	132463	132463	she	2785	" but no doubt , it is true since you say so . How it will answer , I can not tell : I really do n't know . Equality of position and fortune is often advisable in such cases ; and there are twenty years of difference in your ages . He might almost be your father . "
132526	132534	132536	132536	I	0	" No , indeed , Mrs. Fairfax ! "
132540	132584	132536	132536	I	0	" he is nothing like my father ! No one , who saw us together , would suppose it for an instant . Mr. Rochester looks as young , and is as young , as some men at five - and - twenty . "
132585	132598	132599	132599	she	2785	" Is it really for love he is going to marry you ? "
132620	132628	132630	132631	the widow	1549	" I am sorry to grieve you , "
132633	132694	132630	132631	the widow	1549	" but you are so young , and so little acquainted with men , I wished to put you on your guard . It is an old saying that ' all is not gold that glitters ; ' and in this case I do fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or I expect . "
132695	132704	132705	132705	I	0	" Why ? - am I a monster ? "
132708	132723	132705	132705	I	0	" is it impossible that Mr. Rochester should have a sincere affection for me ? "
132724	132885	132630	132631	the widow	1549	" No : you are very well ; and much improved of late ; and Mr. Rochester , I daresay , is fond of you . I have always noticed that you were a sort of pet of his . There are times when , for your sake , I have been a little uneasy at his marked preference , and have wished to put you on your guard : but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong . I knew such an idea would shock , perhaps offend you ; and you were so discreet , and so thoroughly modest and sensible , I hoped you might be trusted to protect yourself . Last night I can not tell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house , and could find you nowhere , nor the master either ; and then , at twelve o'clock , saw you come in with him . "
132886	132894	132895	132895	I	0	" Well , never mind that now , "
132899	132908	132895	132895	I	0	" it is enough that all was right . "
132909	132920	132921	132921	she	2789	" I hope all will be right in the end , "
132924	132964	132921	132921	she	2789	" but believe me , you can not be too careful . Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance : distrust yourself as well as him . Gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marry their governesses . "
132977	132990	132991	132991	she	259	" Let me go , - let me go to Millcote too ! "
132994	133019	132991	132991	she	259	" Mr. Rochester wo n't : though there is so much room in the new carriage . Beg him to let me go mademoiselle . "

133071	133083	133064	133064	Pilot	267	" Adele may accompany us , may she not , sir ? "
133084	133103	133064	133064	Pilot	267	" I told her no . I 'll have no brats ! - I 'll have only you . "
133104	133122	133064	133064	Pilot	267	" Do let her go , Mr. Rochester , if you please : it would be better . "
133123	133133	133134	133134	He	4336	" Not it : she will be a restraint . "
133210	133216	133217	133217	he	4336	" What is the matter ? "
133220	133246	133217	133217	he	4336	" all the sunshine is gone . Do you really wish the bairn to go ? Will it annoy you if she is left behind ? "
133247	133257	133281	133281	him	4336	" I would far rather she went , sir . "
133258	133273	133275	133275	he	4336	" Then off for your bonnet , and back like a flash of lightning ! "
133288	133302	133304	133304	he	4336	" After all , a single morning 's interruption will not matter much , "
133306	133326	133304	133304	he	4336	" when I mean shortly to claim you - your thoughts , conversation , and company - for life . "

133431	133444	133412	133412	she	259	" He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog . "
133453	133480	133412	133412	she	259	" he said , but now he was smiling . Adele heard him , and asked if she was to go to school ' sans mademoiselle ? "
133481	133484	133485	133485	he	0	" Yes , "
133488	133534	133485	133485	he	0	" absolutely sans mademoiselle ; for I am to take mademoiselle to the moon , and there I shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among the volcano - tops , and mademoiselle shall live with me there , and only me . "
133535	133548	133550	133550	Adele	259	" She will have nothing to eat : you will starve her , "
133552	133577	133550	133550	Adele	259	" I shall gather manna for her morning and night : the plains and hillsides in the moon are bleached with manna , Adele . "
133578	133594	133485	133485	he	0	" She will want to warm herself : what will she do for a fire ? "
133595	133629	133485	133485	he	0	" Fire rises out of the lunar mountains : when she is cold , I 'll carry her up to a peak , and lay her down on the edge of a crater . "
133630	133659	133660	133661	Mr. Rochester	251	" Oh , qu ' elle y sera mal - peu comfortable ! And her clothes , they will wear out : how can she get new ones ? "
133667	133670	133672	133672	he	251	" Hem ! "
133674	133719	133672	133672	he	251	" What would you do , Adele ? Cudgel your brains for an expedient . How would a white or a pink cloud answer for a gown , do you think ? And one could cut a pretty enough scarf out of a rainbow . "
133720	133729	133731	133731	Adele	259	" She is far better as she is , "
133738	133768	133731	133731	Adele	259	" besides , she would get tired of living with only you in the moon . If I were mademoiselle , I would never consent to go with you . "
133769	133780	133485	133485	he	0	" She has consented : she has pledged her word . "
133781	133811	133672	133672	he	251	" But you ca n't get her there ; there is no road to the moon : it is all air ; and neither you nor she can fly . "
133812	133820	133731	133731	Adele	259	" Adele , look at that field . "
133868	134056	134057	134057	It	2800	" In that field , Adele , I was walking late one evening about a fortnight since - the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard meadows ; and , as I was tired with raking swaths , I sat down to rest me on a stile ; and there I took out a little book and a pencil , and began to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago , and a wish I had for happy days to come : I was writing away very fast , though daylight was fading from the leaf , when something came up the path and stopped two yards off me . I looked at it . It was a little thing with a veil of gossamer on its head . I beckoned it to come near me ; it stood soon at my knee . I never spoke to it , and it never spoke to me , in words ; but I read its eyes , and it read mine ; and our speechless colloquy was to this effect - "
134159	134273	134147	134147	you	2809	" ' Oh , ' returned the fairy , ' that does not signify ! Here is a talisman will remove all difficulties ; ' and she held out a pretty gold ring . ' Put it , ' she said , ' on the fourth finger of my left hand , and I am yours , and you are mine ; and we shall leave earth , and make our own heaven yonder . ' She nodded again at the moon . The ring , Adele , is in my breeches - pocket , under the disguise of a sovereign : but I mean soon to change it to a ring again . "
134274	134304	134329	134329	she	2811	" But what has mademoiselle to do with it ? I do n't care for the fairy : you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon ? "
134305	134311	134312	134312	he	2810	" Mademoiselle is a fairy , "

134605	134613	134614	134614	he	2810	" It might pass for the present , "
134617	134629	134614	134614	he	2810	" but he would yet see me glittering like a parterre . "
134728	134738	134739	134739	I	0	" It would , indeed , be a relief , "
134742	134835	134739	134739	I	0	" if I had ever so small an independency ; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester , or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling daily round me . I will write to Madeira the moment I get home , and tell my uncle John I am going to be married , and to whom : if I had but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune , I could better endure to be kept by him now . "

134950	135009	134947	134947	I	0	" if you do , I 'll wear nothing but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter . I 'll be married in this lilac gingham : you may make a dressing - gown for yourself out of the pearl - grey silk , and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black satin . "
135018	135030	135031	135031	he	2823	" Oh , it is rich to see and hear her ? "
135034	135070	135031	135031	he	2823	" Is she original ? Is she piquant ? I would not exchange this one little English girl for the Grand Turk 's whole seraglio , gazelle - eyes , houri forms , and all ! "

He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening . I had prepared an occupation for him ; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a tete - e - tete conversation . I remembered his fine voice ; I knew he liked to sing - good singers generally do . I was no vocalist myself , and , in his fastidious judgment , no musician , either ; but I delighted in listening when the performance was good . No sooner had twilight , that hour of romance , began to lower her blue and starry banner over the lattice , than I rose , opened the piano , and entreated him , for the love of heaven , to give me a song . He said I was a capricious witch , and that he would rather sing another time ; but I averred that no time was like the present . "
136099	136103	136094	136094	I	0	" he asked . "

I hied me to the window - recess . And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees and dim lawn , to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following strain:- "
136279	136307	136308	136308	I	0	" Her coming was my hope each day , Her parting was my pain ; The chance that did her steps delay Was ice in every vein . "

136956	136980	136981	136981	He	2853	" I would be quiet if he liked , and as to talking rationally , I flattered myself I was doing that now . "

136997	137083	136994	136994	I	0	" you may fume and fidget as you please : but this is the best plan to pursue with you , I am certain . I like you more than I can say ; but I 'll not sink into a bathos of sentiment : and with this needle of repartee I 'll keep you from the edge of the gulf too ; and , moreover , maintain by its pungent aid that distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual advantage .

It was all right : at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender . Mrs. Fairfax , I saw , approved me : her anxiety on my account vanished ; therefore I was certain I did well . Meantime , Mr. Rochester affirmed I was wearing him to skin and bone , and threatened awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period fast coming . I laughed in my sleeve at his menaces . "
137468	137472	137459	137459	I	0	" I reflected ; "
137498	137734	137735	137736	Mrs. Rochester	363	" Yet after all my task was not an easy one ; often I would rather have pleased than teased him . My future husband was becoming to me my whole world ; and more than the world : almost my hope of heaven . He stood between me and every thought of religion , as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun . I could not , in those days , see God for His creature : of whom I had made an idol . CHAPTER XXV The month of courtship had wasted : its very last hours were being numbered . There was no putting off the day that advanced - the bridal day ; and all preparations for its arrival were complete . I , at least , had nothing more to do : there were my trunks , packed , locked , corded , ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber ; to - morrow , at this time , they would be far on their road to London : and so should I D.V. , - or rather , not I , but one Jane Rochester , a person whom as yet I knew not . The cards of address alone remained to nail on : they lay , four little squares , in the drawer . Mr. Rochester had himself written the direction , "
137743	137907	137735	137736	Mrs. Rochester	363	" on each : I could not persuade myself to affix them , or to have them affixed . Mrs. Rochester ! She did not exist : she would not be born till to - morrow , some time after eight o'clock a.m. ; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the world alive before I assigned to her all that property . It was enough that in yonder closet , opposite my dressing - table , garments said to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet : for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment ; the pearl - coloured robe , the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau . I shut the closet to conceal the strange , wraith - like apparel it contained ; which , at this evening hour - nine o'clock - gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment . "
137918	137922	137908	137908	I	0	" I said . "
137943	138416	137933	137933	I	0	" It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish ; not only the anticipation of the great change - the new life which was to commence to - morrow : both these circumstances had their share , doubtless , in producing that restless , excited mood which hurried me forth at this late hour into the darkening grounds : but a third cause influenced my mind more than they . I had at heart a strange and anxious thought . Something had happened which I could not comprehend ; no one knew of or had seen the event but myself : it had taken place the preceding night . Mr. Rochester that night was absent from home ; nor was he yet returned : business had called him to a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles off - business it was requisite he should settle in person , previous to his meditated departure from England . I waited now his return ; eager to disburthen my mind , and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that perplexed me . Stay till he comes , reader ; and , when I disclose my secret to him , you shall share the confidence . I sought the orchard , driven to its shelter by the wind , which all day had blown strong and full from the south , without , however , bringing a speck of rain . Instead of subsiding as night drew on , it seemed to augment its rush and deepen its roar : the trees blew steadfastly one way , never writhing round , and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an hour ; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads northward - the clouds drifted from pole to pole , fast following , mass on mass : no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day . It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind , delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air - torrent thundering through space . Descending the laurel walk , I faced the wreck of the chestnut - tree ; it stood up black and riven : the trunk , split down the centre , gasped ghastly . The cloven halves were not broken from each other , for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below ; though community of vitality was destroyed - the sap could flow no more : their great boughs on each side were dead , and next winter 's tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth : as yet , however , they might be said to form one tree - a ruin , but an entire ruin . "
138427	138446	138417	138417	You	2858	" I said : as if the monster - splinters were living things , and could hear me . "
138536	138816	138526	138527	a comrade	2860	" As I looked up at them , the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure ; her disk was blood- red and half overcast ; she seemed to throw on me one bewildered , dreary glance , and buried herself again instantly in the deep drift of cloud . The wind fell , for a second , round Thornfield ; but far away over wood and water , poured a wild , melancholy wail : it was sad to listen to , and I ran off again . Here and there I strayed through the orchard , gathered up the apples with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn ; then I employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe ; I carried them into the house and put them away in the store - room . Then I repaired to the library to ascertain whether the fire was lit , for , though summer , I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful hearth when he came in : yes , the fire had been kindled some time , and burnt well . I placed his arm - chair by the chimney - corner : I wheeled the table near it : I let down the curtain , and had the candles brought in ready for lighting . More restless than ever , when I had completed these arrangements I could not sit still , nor even remain in the house : a little time - piece in the room and the old clock in the hall simultaneously struck ten . "
138822	138826	138526	138527	a comrade	2860	" I said . "
138868	138996	138997	138997	I	0	" The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates ; but the road as far as I could see , to the right hand and the left , was all still and solitary : save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at intervals as the moon looked out , it was but a long pale line , unvaried by one moving speck . A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked - a tear of disappointment and impatience ; ashamed of it , I wiped it away . I lingered ; the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber , and drew close her curtain of dense cloud : the night grew dark ; rain came driving fast on the gale . "
139009	139094	139005	139005	he	2862	" I exclaimed , seized with hypochondriac foreboding . I had expected his arrival before tea ; now it was dark : what could keep him ? Had an accident happened ? The event of last night again recurred to me . I interpreted it as a warning of disaster . I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised ; and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its meridian , and must now decline . "
139105	139109	139110	139110	I	0	" I thought ; "
139143	139252	139110	139110	I	0	" I set out ; I walked fast , but not far : ere I had measured a quarter of a mile , I heard the tramp of hoofs ; a horseman came on , full gallop ; a dog ran by his side . Away with evil presentiment ! It was he : here he was , mounted on Mesrour , followed by Pilot . He saw me ; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky , and rode in it watery bright : he took his hat off , and waved it round his head . I now ran to meet him . "
139255	139271	139110	139110	I	0	" he exclaimed , as he stretched out his hand and bent from the saddle : "
139297	139344	139110	139110	I	0	" I obeyed : joy made me agile : I sprang up before him . A hearty kissing I got for a welcome , and some boastful triumph , which I swallowed as well as I could . He checked himself in his exultation to demand , "

139452	139463	139442	139442	I	0	" Nothing now ; I am neither afraid nor unhappy . "
139464	139471	139442	139442	I	0	" Then you have been both ? "
139472	139504	139442	139442	I	0	" Rather : but I 'll tell you all about it by - and - bye , sir ; and I daresay you will only laugh at me for my pains . "
139505	139599	139644	139644	he	360	" I 'll laugh at you heartily when to - morrow is past ; till then I dare not : my prize is not certain . This is you , who have been as slippery as an eel this last month , and as thorny as a briar - rose ? I could not lay a finger anywhere but I was pricked ; and now I seem to have gathered up a stray lamb in my arms . You wandered out of the fold to seek your shepherd , did you , Jane ? "
139600	139622	139623	139623	He	2866	" I wanted you : but do n't boast . Here we are at Thornfield : now let me get down . "
139706	139738	139739	139739	I	0	" Take a seat and bear me company , Jane : please God , it is the last meal but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time . "
139753	139783	139739	139739	I	0	" Is it because you have the prospect of a journey before you , Jane ? Is it the thoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite ? "
139784	139816	139854	139854	his	360	" I can not see my prospects clearly to - night , sir ; and I hardly know what thoughts I have in my head . Everything in life seems unreal . "
139817	139829	139854	139854	his	360	" Except me : I am substantial enough - touch me . "
139830	139850	139851	139851	He	360	" You , sir , are the most phantom - like of all : you are a mere dream . "
139859	139865	139867	139867	he	360	" Is that a dream ? "
139896	139909	139911	139911	I	0	" Yes ; though I touch it , it is a dream , "
139923	139931	139911	139911	I	0	" Sir , have you finished supper ? "
139932	139937	139938	139938	I	0	" Yes , Jane . "
139971	139977	139978	139978	I	0	" It is near midnight , "
139981	140001	139978	139978	I	0	" Yes : but remember , Jane , you promised to wake with me the night before my wedding . "
140002	140030	139938	139938	I	0	" I did ; and I will keep my promise , for an hour or two at least : I have no wish to go to bed . "
140031	140038	139938	139938	I	0	" Are all your arrangements complete ? "
140039	140044	139978	139978	I	0	" All , sir . "
140045	140052	140053	140053	he	4336	" And on my part likewise , "
140056	140083	140053	140053	he	4336	" I have settled everything ; and we shall leave Thornfield to - morrow , within half - an - hour after our return from church . "
140084	140090	139978	139978	I	0	" Very well , sir . "
140091	140133	139978	139978	I	0	" With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word - ' ve ry well , ' Jane ! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek ! and how strangely your eyes glitter ! Are you well ? "
140134	140140	140053	140053	he	4336	" I believe I am . "
140141	140155	139978	139978	I	0	" Believe ! What is the matter ? Tell me what you feel . "
140156	140192	139978	139978	I	0	" I could not , sir : no words could tell you what I feel . I wish this present hour would never end : who knows with what fate the next may come charged ? "
140193	140212	140053	140053	he	4336	" This is hypochondria , Jane . You have been over - excited , or over - fatigued . "
140213	140224	139978	139978	I	0	" Do you , sir , feel calm and happy ? "
140225	140240	140241	140241	I	0	" Calm ? - no : but happy - to the heart 's core . "
140262	140270	140271	140271	he	2872	" Give me your confidence , Jane , "
140274	140304	140271	140271	he	2872	" relieve your mind of any weight that oppresses it , by imparting it to me . What do you fear?- -that I shall not prove a good husband ? "
140305	140315	140053	140053	he	4336	" It is the idea farthest from my thoughts . "
140316	140341	140053	140053	he	4336	" Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter ? - of the new life into which you are passing ? "
140342	140345	139978	139978	I	0	" No . "
140346	140370	140053	140053	he	4336	" You puzzle me , Jane : your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex and pain me . I want an explanation . "
140371	140385	140053	140053	he	4336	" Then , sir , listen . You were from home last night ? "
140386	140456	139978	139978	I	0	" I was : I know that ; and you hinted a while ago at something which had happened in my absence:- nothing , probably , of consequence ; but , in short , it has disturbed you . Let me hear it . Mrs. Fairfax has said something , perhaps ? or you have overheard the servants talk ? - your sensitive self - respect has been wounded ? "
140457	140462	140053	140053	he	4336	" No , sir . "
140494	140931	140491	140491	I	0	" All day yesterday I was very busy , and very happy in my ceaseless bustle ; for I am not , as you seem to think , troubled by any haunting fears about the new sphere , et cetera : I think it a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you , because I love you . No , sir , do n't caress me now - let me talk undisturbed . Yesterday I trusted well in Providence , and believed that events were working together for your good and mine : it was a fine day , if you recollect - the calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your journey . I walked a little while on the pavement after tea , thinking of you ; and I beheld you in imagination so near me , I scarcely missed your actual presence . I thought of the life that lay before me - YOUR life , sir - an existence more expansive and stirring than my own : as much more so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows of its own strait channel . I wondered why moralists call this world a dreary wilderness : for me it blossomed like a rose . Just at sunset , the air turned cold and the sky cloudy : I went in , Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding - dress , which they had just brought ; and under it in the box I found your present - the veil which , in your princely extravagance , you sent for from London : resolved , I suppose , since I would not have jewels , to cheat me into accepting something as costly . I smiled as I unfolded it , and devised how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes , and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress . I though how I would carry down to you the square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my low - born head , and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could bring her husband neither fortune , beauty , nor connections . I saw plainly how you would look ; and heard your impetuous republican answers , and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your wealth , or elevate your standing , by marrying either a purse or a coronet . "
140932	140942	140944	140945	Mr. Rochester	251	" How well you read me , you witch ! "
140947	140976	140944	140945	Mr. Rochester	251	" but what did you find in the veil besides its embroidery ? Did you find poison , or a dagger , that you look so mournful now ? "
140977	141342	140491	140491	I	0	" No , no , sir ; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric , I found nothing save Fairfax Rochester 's pride ; and that did not scare me , because I am used to the sight of the demon . But , sir , as it grew dark , the wind rose : it blew yesterday evening , not as it blows now - wild and high - but ' with a sullen , moaning sound ' far more eerie . I wished you were at home . I came into this room , and the sight of the empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me . For some time after I went to bed , I could not sleep - a sense of anxious excitement distressed me . The gale still rising , seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under - sound ; whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell , but it recurred , doubtful yet doleful at every lull ; at last I made out it must be some dog howling at a distance . I was glad when it ceased . On sleeping , I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night . I continued also the wish to be with you , and experienced a strange , regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us . During all my first sleep , I was following the windings of an unknown road ; total obscurity environed me ; rain pelted me ; I was burdened with the charge of a little child : a very small creature , too young and feeble to walk , and which shivered in my cold arms , and wailed piteously in my ear . I thought , sir , that you were on the road a long way before me ; and I strained every nerve to overtake you , and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat you to stop - but my movements were fettered , and my voice still died away inarticulate ; while you , I felt , withdrew farther and farther every moment . "
141343	141464	141484	141484	he	2873	" And these dreams weigh on your spirits now , Jane , when I am close to you ? Little nervous subject ! Forget visionary woe , and think only of real happiness ! You say you love me , Janet : yes - I will not forget that ; and you can not deny it . THOSE words did not die inarticulate on your lips . I heard them clear and soft : a thought too solemn perhaps , but sweet as music - ' I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you , Edward , because I love you . ' Do you love me , Jane ? - repeat it . "
141465	141479	140944	140945	Mr. Rochester	251	" I do , sir - I do , with my whole heart . "
141480	141483	141484	141484	he	2873	" Well , "
141493	141605	141484	141484	he	2873	" it is strange ; but that sentence has penetrated my breast painfully . Why ? I think because you said it with such an earnest , religious energy , and because your upward gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith , truth , and devotion : it is too much as if some spirit were near me . Look wicked , Jane : as you know well how to look : coin one of your wild , shy , provoking smiles ; tell me you hate me - tease me , vex me ; do anything but move me : I would rather be incensed than saddened . "
141606	141634	140944	140945	Mr. Rochester	251	" I will tease you and vex you to your heart 's content , when I have finished my tale : but hear me to the end . "
141635	141661	141662	141662	I	0	" I thought , Jane , you had told me all . I thought I had found the source of your melancholy in a dream . "
141667	141695	141662	141662	I	0	" What ! is there more ? But I will not believe it to be anything important . I warn you of incredulity beforehand . Go on . "
141717	142015	141714	141714	I	0	" I dreamt another dream , sir : that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin , the retreat of bats and owls . I thought that of all the stately front nothing remained but a shell - like wall , very high and very fragile - looking . I wandered , on a moonlight night , through the grass - grown enclosure within : here I stumbled over a marble hearth , and there over a fallen fragment of cornice . Wrapped up in a shawl , I still carried the unknown little child : I might not lay it down anywhere , however tired were my arms - however much its weight impeded my progress , I must retain it . I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the road ; I was sure it was you ; and you were departing for many years and for a distant country . I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste , eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top : the stones rolled from under my feet , the ivy branches I grasped gave way , the child clung round my neck in terror , and almost strangled me ; at last I gained the summit . I saw you like a speck on a white track , lessening every moment . The blast blew so strong I could not stand . I sat down on the narrow ledge ; I hushed the scared infant in my lap : you turned an angle of the road : I bent forward to take a last look ; the wall crumbled ; I was shaken ; the child rolled from my knee , I lost my balance , fell , and woke . "
142016	142025	141662	141662	I	0	" Now , Jane , that is all . "
142026	142255	141714	141714	I	0	" All the preface , sir ; the tale is yet to come . On waking , a gleam dazzled my eyes ; I thought - Oh , it is daylight ! But I was mistaken ; it was only candlelight . Sophie , I supposed , had come in . There was a light in the dressing - table , and the door of the closet , where , before going to bed , I had hung my wedding - dress and veil , stood open ; I heard a rustling there . I asked , ' Sophie , what are you doing ? ' No one answered ; but a form emerged from the closet ; it took the light , held it aloft , and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau . ' Sophie ! Sophie ! ' I again cried : and still it was silent . I had risen up in bed , I bent forward : first surprise , then bewilderment , came over me ; and then my blood crept cold through my veins . Mr. Rochester , this was not Sophie , it was not Leah , it was not Mrs. Fairfax : it was not - no , I was sure of it , and am still - it was not even that strange woman , Grace Poole . "
142256	142265	142267	142268	my master	4336	" It must have been one of them , "
142270	142311	142267	142268	my master	4336	" No , sir , I solemnly assure you to the contrary . The shape standing before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield Hall before ; the height , the contour were new to me . "
142312	142318	141714	141714	I	0	" Describe it , Jane . "
142319	142372	141714	141714	I	0	" It seemed , sir , a woman , tall and large , with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back . I know not what dress she had on : it was white and straight ; but whether gown , sheet , or shroud , I can not tell . "
142373	142380	142267	142268	my master	4336	" Did you see her face ? "
142381	142442	141714	141714	I	0	" Not at first . But presently she took my veil from its place ; she held it up , gazed at it long , and then she threw it over her own head , and turned to the mirror . At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass . "
142443	142449	141714	141714	I	0	" And how were they ? "
142450	142501	142267	142268	my master	4336	" Fearful and ghastly to me - oh , sir , I never saw a face like it ! It was a discoloured face - it was a savage face . I wish I could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments ! "
142502	142510	141714	141714	I	0	" Ghosts are usually pale , Jane . "
142511	142550	141714	141714	I	0	" This , sir , was purple : the lips were swelled and dark ; the brow furrowed : the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes . Shall I tell you of what it reminded me ? "
142551	142555	141714	141714	I	0	" You may . "
142556	142566	142267	142268	my master	4336	" Of the foul German spectre - the Vampyre . "
142567	142576	141714	141714	I	0	" Ah ! - what did it do ? "
142577	142606	141714	141714	I	0	" Sir , it removed my veil from its gaunt head , rent it in two parts , and flinging both on the floor , trampled on them . "
142607	142610	141714	141714	I	0	" Afterwards ? "
142611	142708	142267	142268	my master	4336	" It drew aside the window - curtain and looked out ; perhaps it saw dawn approaching , for , taking the candle , it retreated to the door . Just at my bedside , the figure stopped : the fiery eyes glared upon me - she thrust up her candle close to my face , and extinguished it under my eyes . I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine , and I lost consciousness : for the second time in my life - only the second time - I became insensible from terror . "
142709	142718	141714	141714	I	0	" Who was with you when you revived ? "
142719	142781	141714	141714	I	0	" No one , sir , but the broad day . I rose , bathed my head and face in water , drank a long draught ; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill , and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision . Now , sir , tell me who and what that woman was ? "
142782	142816	142267	142268	my master	4336	" The creature of an over - stimulated brain ; that is certain . I must be careful of you , my treasure : nerves like yours were not made for rough handling . "
142817	142842	141714	141714	I	0	" Sir , depend on it , my nerves were not in fault ; the thing was real : the transaction actually took place . "
142843	142885	141714	141714	I	0	" And your previous dreams , were they real too ? Is Thornfield Hall a ruin ? Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles ? Am I leaving you without a tear - without a kiss - without a word ? "
142886	142890	142267	142268	my master	4336	" Not yet . "
142891	142934	141714	141714	I	0	" Am I about to do it ? Why , the day is already commenced which is to bind us indissolubly ; and when we are once united , there shall be no recurrence of these mental terrors : I guarantee that . "
142935	142975	141714	141714	I	0	" Mental terrors , sir ! I wish I could believe them to be only such : I wish it more now than ever ; since even you can not explain to me the mystery of that awful visitant . "
142976	142993	141714	141714	I	0	" And since I can not do it , Jane , it must have been unreal . "
142994	143064	143065	143065	I	0	" But , sir , when I said so to myself on rising this morning , and when I looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful aspect of each familiar object in full daylight , there - on the carpet - I saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis , - the veil , torn from top to bottom in two halves ! "
143081	143085	143086	143086	he	251	" Thank God ! "
143089	143119	143086	143086	he	251	" that if anything malignant did come near you last night , it was only the veil that was harmed . Oh , to think what might have happened ! "
143150	143353	143145	143145	he	251	" Now , Janet , I 'll explain to you all about it . It was half dream , half reality . A woman did , I doubt not , enter your room : and that woman was - must have been - Grace Poole . You call her a strange being yourself : from all you know , you have reason so to call her - what did she do to me ? what to Mason ? In a state between sleeping and waking , you noticed her entrance and her actions ; but feverish , almost delirious as you were , you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own : the long dishevelled hair , the swelled black face , the exaggerated stature , were figments of imagination ; results of nightmare : the spiteful tearing of the veil was real : and it is like her . I see you would ask why I keep such a woman in my house : when we have been married a year and a day , I will tell you ; but not now . Are you satisfied , Jane ? Do you accept my solution of the mystery ? "
143416	143427	143428	143428	he	2876	" Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery ? "
143437	143442	143428	143428	he	2876	" Yes , sir . "
143443	143502	143394	143394	him	2876	" And there is room enough in Adele 's little bed for you . You must share it with her to - night , Jane : it is no wonder that the incident you have related should make you nervous , and I would rather you did not sleep alone : promise me to go to the nursery . "
143503	143515	143605	143605	he	2877	" I shall be very glad to do so , sir . "
143516	143604	143605	143605	he	2877	" And fasten the door securely on the inside . Wake Sophie when you go upstairs , under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to - morrow ; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight . And now , no more sombre thoughts : chase dull care away , Janet . Do n't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen ? and there is no more beating of rain against the window - panes : look here "
143611	143618	143605	143605	he	2877	" it is a lovely night ! "
143660	143663	143665	143666	Mr. Rochester	251	" Well , "
143674	143681	143665	143666	Mr. Rochester	251	" how is my Janet now ? "
143682	143694	143665	143666	Mr. Rochester	251	" The night is serene , sir ; and so am I. "
143695	143717	143725	143725	I	0	" And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to - night ; but of happy love and blissful union . "
143962	143965	143966	143966	she	256	" Stop ! "
143971	143986	143966	143966	she	256	" Look at yourself in the mirror : you have not taken one peep . "
144017	144020	144066	144066	He	251	" Jane ! "
144043	144046	144047	144047	he	251	" Lingerer ! "
144050	144065	144047	144047	he	251	" my brain is on fire with impatience , and you tarry so long ! "
144083	144105	144082	144082	me	0	" fair as a lily , and not only the pride of his life , but the desire of his eyes , "
144140	144148	144134	144135	a footman	2883	" Is John getting the carriage ready ? "
144149	144154	144122	144122	he	251	" Yes , sir . "
144155	144162	144122	144122	he	251	" Is the luggage brought down ? "
144163	144172	144134	144135	a footman	2883	" They are bringing it down , sir . "
144173	144197	144122	144122	he	251	" Go you to the church : see if Mr. Wood the clergyman and the clerk are there : return and tell me . "
144218	144233	144213	144214	the footman	2212	" Mr. Wood is in the vestry , sir , putting on his surplice . "
144234	144239	144134	144135	a footman	2883	" And the carriage ? "
144240	144246	144134	144135	a footman	2883	" The horses are harnessing . "
144247	144285	144213	144214	the footman	2212	" We shall not want it to go to church ; but it must be ready the moment we return : all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on , and the coachman in his seat . "
144286	144291	144134	144135	a footman	2883	" Yes , sir . "
144292	144299	144300	144300	I	0	" Jane , are you ready ? "
144524	144532	144533	144533	he	251	" Am I cruel in my love ? "
144536	144547	144533	144533	he	251	" Delay an instant : lean on me , Jane . "
144913	144999	145000	145000	He	251	" I require and charge you both as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment , when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed , that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined together in matrimony , ye do now confess it ; for be ye well assured that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God 's Word doth allow , are not joined together by God , neither is their matrimony lawful . "
145073	145084	145057	145057	his	6499	" Wilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife ? "
145094	145110	145057	145057	his	6499	" The marriage can not go on : I declare the existence of an impediment . "
145159	145162	145156	145156	he	251	" Proceed . "
145184	145206	145179	145181	Presently Mr. Wood	374	" I can not proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted , and evidence of its truth or falsehood . "
145207	145215	145217	145220	the voice behind us	2918	" The ceremony is quite broken off , "
145222	145241	145179	145181	Presently Mr. Wood	374	" I am in a condition to prove my allegation : an insuperable impediment to this marriage exists . "
145313	145322	145323	145323	he	374	" What is the nature of the impediment ? "
145326	145337	145323	145323	he	374	" Perhaps it may be got over - explained away ? "
145338	145341	145369	145369	He	374	" Hardly , "
145346	145358	145359	145360	The speaker	2916	" I have called it insuperable , and I speak advisedly . "
145385	145405	145369	145369	He	374	" It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage . Mr. Rochester has a wife now living . "
145523	145528	145529	145529	he	251	" Who are you ? "
145535	145549	145529	145529	he	251	" My name is Briggs , a solicitor of - Street , London . "
145550	145560	145508	145508	he	251	" And you would thrust on me a wife ? "
145561	145584	145529	145529	he	251	" I would remind you of your lady 's existence , sir , which the law recognises , if you do not . "
145585	145606	145529	145529	he	251	" Favour me with an account of her - with her name , her parentage , her place of abode . "
145607	145610	145508	145508	he	251	" Certainly . "
145632	145744	145618	145618	his	376	" ' I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. - a date of fifteen years back , Edward Fairfax Rochester , of Thornfield Hall , in the county of - , and of Ferndean Manor , in -shire , England , was married to my sister , Bertha Antoinetta Mason , daughter of Jonas Mason , merchant , and of Antoinetta his wife , a Creole , at - church , Spanish Town , Jamaica . The record of the marriage will be found in the register of that church - a copy of it is now in my possession . Signed , Richard Mason . ' "
145745	145777	145618	145618	his	376	" That - if a genuine document - may prove I have been married , but it does not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living . "
145778	145786	145788	145789	the lawyer	2923	" She was living three months ago , "
145791	145797	145788	145789	the lawyer	2923	" How do you know ? "
145798	145818	145618	145618	his	376	" I have a witness to the fact , whose testimony even you , sir , will scarcely controvert . "
145819	145828	145788	145789	the lawyer	2923	" Produce him - or go to hell . "
145829	145852	145853	145854	Mr. Rochester	251	" I will produce him first - he is on the spot . Mr. Mason , have the goodness to step forward . "
146032	146036	146024	146024	Mason	337	" Good God ! "
146060	146067	146056	146056	he	251	" What have YOU to say ? "
146077	146100	146056	146056	he	251	" The devil is in it if you can not answer distinctly . I again demand , what have you to say ? "
146101	146106	146108	146109	the clergyman	6499	" Sir - sir , "
146111	146122	146108	146109	the clergyman	6499	" do not forget you are in a sacred place . "
146131	146149	146127	146127	he	6499	" Are you aware , sir , whether or not this gentleman 's wife is still living ? "
146150	146153	146155	146156	the lawyer	2923	" Courage , "
146163	146164	146155	146156	the lawyer	2923	" "
146173	146182	146183	146183	I	0	" said Mason , in more articulate tones : "
146195	146196	146190	146190	I	0	" "
146201	146206	146190	146190	I	0	" ejaculated the clergyman . "
146232	146248	146225	146227	a Mrs. Rochester	363	" I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester 's lips , and he muttered - "
146271	146293	146254	146254	I	0	" He mused - for ten minutes he held counsel with himself : he formed his resolve , and announced it - "
146340	146353	146321	146322	John Green	383	" The man obeyed . Mr. Rochester continued , hardily and recklessly : "
146782	146790	146779	146780	This girl	4724	" he continued , looking at me , "
146848	146877	146844	146844	you	2968	" Still holding me fast , he left the church : the three gentlemen came after . At the front door of the hall we found the carriage . "
146889	146895	146887	146887	John	383	" said Mr. Rochester coolly ; "
146905	146926	146844	146844	you	2968	" At our entrance , Mrs. Fairfax , Adele , Sophie , Leah , advanced to meet and greet us . "
146936	146941	146844	146844	you	2968	" cried the master ; "
146962	147037	147038	147038	You	2968	" He passed on and ascended the stairs , still holding my hand , and still beckoning the gentlemen to follow him , which they did . We mounted the first staircase , passed up the gallery , proceeded to the third storey : the low , black door , opened by Mr. Rochester 's master - key , admitted us to the tapestried room , with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet . "
147045	147058	147059	147059	He	378	" said our guide ; ' she bit and stabbed you here . "
147209	147217	147219	147220	Mr. Rochester	251	" Good - morrow , Mrs. Poole ! "
147222	147236	147219	147220	Mr. Rochester	251	" How are you ? and how is your charge to - day ? "
147237	147248	147250	147250	Grace	263	" We 're tolerable , sir , I thank you , "
147262	147271	147250	147250	Grace	263	" rather snappish , but not ' rageous . "
147300	147309	147311	147311	Grace	263	" Ah ! sir , she sees you ! "
147313	147320	147311	147311	Grace	263	" you 'd better not stay . "
147321	147337	147355	147356	The maniac	2984	" Only a few moments , Grace : you must allow me a few moments . "
147338	147354	147355	147356	The maniac	2984	" Take care then , sir ! - for God 's sake , take care ! "
147391	147398	147400	147401	Mr. Rochester	251	" Keep out of the way , "
147424	147425	147426	147426	One	4415	" "
147451	147452	147435	147435	she	287	" "
147459	147463	147435	147435	she	287	" whispered Mason . "
147469	147480	147482	147482	Ware	384	" was his brother - in - law 's recommendation . "
147484	147653	147482	147482	Ware	384	" cried Grace . The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously . Mr. Rochester flung me behind him : the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat viciously , and laid her teeth to his cheek : they struggled . She was a big woman , in stature almost equalling her husband , and corpulent besides : she showed virile force in the contest - more than once she almost throttled him , athletic as he was . He could have settled her with a well - planted blow ; but he would not strike : he would only wrestle . At last he mastered her arms ; Grace Poole gave him a cord , and he pinioned them behind her : with more rope , which was at hand , he bound her to a chair . The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the most convulsive plunges . Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators : he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate . "
147659	147663	147656	147657	MY WIFE	2180	" said he . "
147696	147704	147656	147657	MY WIFE	2180	" laying his hand on my shoulder : "
147811	147843	147844	147844	You	2994	" We all withdrew . Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us , to give some further order to Grace Poole . The solicitor addressed me as he descended the stair . "
147848	147852	147844	147844	You	2994	" said he , "
147885	147886	147879	147880	Mr. Mason	337	" "
147899	147900	147901	147902	Mr. Mason	337	" "
148176	148183	148132	148132	I	0	" he inquired of Mr. Mason . "
148193	149130	148132	148132	I	0	" was the anxious reply ; and without waiting to take leave of Mr. Rochester , they made their exit at the hall door . The clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences , either of admonition or reproof , with his haughty parishioner ; this duty done , he too departed . I heard him go as I stood at the half - open door of my own room , to which I had now withdrawn . The house cleared , I shut myself in , fastened the bolt that none might intrude , and proceeded - not to weep , not to mourn , I was yet too calm for that , but - mechanically to take off the wedding dress , and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday , as I thought , for the last time . I then sat down : I felt weak and tired . I leaned my arms on a table , and my head dropped on them . And now I thought : till now I had only heard , seen , moved - followed up and down where I was led or dragged - watched event rush on event , disclosure open beyond disclosure : but NOW , I THOUGHT . The morning had been a quiet morning enough - all except the brief scene with the lunatic : the transaction in the church had not been noisy ; there was no explosion of passion , no loud altercation , no dispute , no defiance or challenge , no tears , no sobs : a few words had been spoken , a calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made ; some stern , short questions put by Mr. Rochester ; answers , explanations given , evidence adduced ; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master ; then the living proof had been seen ; the intruders were gone , and all was over . I was in my own room as usual - just myself , without obvious change : nothing had smitten me , or scathed me , or maimed me . And yet where was the Jane Eyre of yesterday ? - where was her life ? - where were her prospects ? Jane Eyre , who had been an ardent , expectant woman - almost a bride , was a cold , solitary girl again : her life was pale ; her prospects were desolate . A Christmas frost had come at midsummer ; a white December storm had whirled over June ; ice glazed the ripe apples , drifts crushed the blowing roses ; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud : lanes which last night blushed full of flowers , to - day were pathless with untrodden snow ; and the woods , which twelve hours since waved leafy and flagrant as groves between the tropics , now spread , waste , wild , and white as pine - forests in wintry Norway . My hopes were all dead - struck with a subtle doom , such as , in one night , fell on all the first - born in the land of Egypt . I looked on my cherished wishes , yesterday so blooming and glowing ; they lay stark , chill , livid corpses that could never revive . I looked at my love : that feeling which was my master 's - which he had created ; it shivered in my heart , like a suffering child in a cold cradle ; sickness and anguish had seized it ; it could not seek Mr. Rochester 's arms - it could not derive warmth from his breast . Oh , never more could it turn to him ; for faith was blighted - confidence destroyed ! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been ; for he was not what I had thought him . I would not ascribe vice to him ; I would not say he had betrayed me ; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from his idea , and from his presence I must go : THAT I perceived well . When - how - whither , I could not yet discern ; but he himself , I doubted not , would hurry me from Thornfield . Real affection , it seemed , he could not have for me ; it had been only fitful passion : that was balked ; he would want me no more . I should fear even to cross his path now : my view must be hateful to him . Oh , how blind had been my eyes ! How weak my conduct ! My eyes were covered and closed : eddying darkness seemed to swim round me , and reflection came in as black and confused a flow . Self - abandoned , relaxed , and effortless , I seemed to have laid me down in the dried - up bed of a great river ; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains , and felt the torrent come : to rise I had no will , to flee I had no strength . I lay faint , longing to be dead . One idea only still throbbed life - like within me - a remembrance of God : it begot an unuttered prayer : these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind , as something that should be whispered , but no energy was found to express them - "
149148	149241	149249	149249	I	0	" It was near : and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it - as I had neither joined my hands , nor bent my knees , nor moved my lips - it came : in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me . The whole consciousness of my life lorn , my love lost , my hope quenched , my faith death - struck , swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass . That bitter hour can not be described : in truth , "
149271	149305	149249	149249	I	0	" CHAPTER XXVII Some time in the afternoon I raised my head , and looking round and seeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall , I asked , "
149312	149320	149249	149249	I	0	" But the answer my mind gave - "
149325	149350	149249	149249	I	0	" - was so prompt , so dread , that I stopped my ears . I said I could not bear such words now . "
149367	149371	149249	149249	I	0	" I alleged : "
149420	149519	149414	149414	I	0	" But , then , a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that I should do it . I wrestled with my own resolution : I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me ; and Conscience , turned tyrant , held Passion by the throat , told her tauntingly , she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough , and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded depths of agony . "
149526	149531	149414	149414	I	0	" then I cried . "
149537	149538	149547	149547	none	914	" "
149583	149708	149709	149709	Friends	1114	" I rose up suddenly , terror - struck at the solitude which so ruthless a judge haunted , - at the silence which so awful a voice filled . My head swam as I stood erect . I perceived that I was sickening from excitement and inanition ; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day , for I had taken no breakfast . And , with a strange pang , I now reflected that , long as I had been shut up here , no message had been sent to ask how I was , or to invite me to come down : not even little Adele had tapped at the door ; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me . "
149717	149797	149798	149798	You	3012	" I murmured , as I undrew the bolt and passed out . I stumbled over an obstacle : my head was still dizzy , my sight was dim , and my limbs were feeble . I could not soon recover myself . I fell , but not on to the ground : an outstretched arm caught me . I looked up - I was supported by Mr. Rochester , who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold . "
149804	149808	149798	149798	You	3012	" he said . "
149966	149967	149954	149954	I	0	" "
150013	150014	150015	150015	Jane	146	" "
150092	150164	150087	150087	you	3012	" Reader , I forgave him at the moment and on the spot . There was such deep remorse in his eye , such true pity in his tone , such manly energy in his manner ; and besides , there was such unchanged love in his whole look and mien - I forgave him all : yet not in words , not outwardly ; only at my heart 's core . "
150174	150202	150172	150172	Jane	146	" ere long he inquired wistfully - wondering , I suppose , at my continued silence and tameness , the result rather of weakness than of will . "
150207	150208	150172	150172	Jane	146	" "
150222	150223	150224	150224	I	0	" "
150239	150349	150234	150234	I	0	" He heaved a sort of shuddering sigh , and taking me in his arms , carried me downstairs . At first I did not know to what room he had borne me ; all was cloudy to my glazed sight : presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire ; for , summer as it was , I had become icy cold in my chamber . He put wine to my lips ; I tasted it and revived ; then I ate something he offered me , and was soon myself . I was in the library - sitting in his chair - he was quite near . "
150372	150376	150378	150378	I	0	" I thought ; "
150423	150424	150417	150417	I	0	" "
150432	150433	150427	150427	you	0	" "
150445	150446	150452	150452	Jane	146	" "
150454	150534	150452	150452	Jane	146	" I obeyed him ; then he put the glass on the table , stood before me , and looked at me attentively . Suddenly he turned away , with an inarticulate exclamation , full of passionate emotion of some kind ; he walked fast through the room and came back ; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me ; but I remembered caresses were now forbidden . I turned my face away and put his aside . "
150542	150547	150550	150550	I	0	" he exclaimed hastily . "
150573	150574	150563	150563	You	0	" "
150590	150591	150588	150588	sir	4374	" "
150628	150629	150624	150624	I	0	" "
150632	150633	150624	150624	I	0	" "
150804	150805	150796	150796	you	146	" "
150817	150832	150808	150808	I	0	" I said ; and my unsteady voice warned me to curtail my sentence . "
150965	150975	150937	150938	That man	3029	" I cleared and steadied my voice to reply : "
151026	151027	151020	151022	a new governess	1405	" "
151287	151443	151450	151450	him	3047	" Concealing the mad - woman 's neighbourhood from you , however , was something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas - tree : that demon 's vicinage is poisoned , and always was . But I 'll shut up Thornfield Hall : I 'll nail up the front door and board the lower windows : I 'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with MY WIFE , as you term that fearful hag : Grace will do much for money , and she shall have her son , the keeper at Grimsby Retreat , to bear her company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms , when MY WIFE is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night , to stab them , to bite their flesh from their bones , and so on - "
151444	151447	151448	151448	I	0	" Sir , "
151452	151483	151448	151448	I	0	" you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady : you speak of her with hate - with vindictive antipathy . It is cruel - she can not help being mad . "
151484	151540	151450	151450	him	3047	" Jane , my little darling so I will call you , for so you are , you do n't know what you are talking about ; you misjudge me again : it is not because she is mad I hate her . If you were mad , do you think I should hate you ? "
151541	151548	151450	151450	him	3047	" I do indeed , sir . "
151549	151842	151450	151450	him	3047	" Then you are mistaken , and you know nothing about me , and nothing about the sort of love of which I am capable . Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own : in pain and sickness it would still be dear . Your mind is my treasure , and if it were broken , it would be my treasure still : if you raved , my arms should confine you , and not a strait waistcoat - your grasp , even in fury , would have a charm for me : if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning , I should receive you in an embrace , at least as fond as it would be restrictive . I should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her : in your quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me ; and I could hang over you with untiring tenderness , though you gave me no smile in return ; and never weary of gazing into your eyes , though they had no longer a ray of recognition for me . - But why do I follow that train of ideas ? I was talking of removing you from Thornfield . All , you know , is prepared for prompt departure : to - morrow you shall go . I only ask you to endure one more night under this roof , Jane ; and then , farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever ! I have a place to repair to , which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences , from unwelcome intrusion - even from falsehood and slander . "
151843	151852	151853	151853	I	0	" And take Adele with you , sir , "

152001	152083	151998	151998	you	4374	" I shook my head : it required a degree of courage , excited as he was becoming , even to risk that mute sign of dissent . He had been walking fast about the room , and he stopped , as if suddenly rooted to one spot . He looked at me long and hard : I turned my eyes from him , fixed them on the fire , and tried to assume and maintain a quiet , collected aspect . "
152093	152113	151998	151998	you	4374	" he said at last , speaking more calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak . "
152174	152192	152193	152193	Jane	146	" He recommenced his walk , but soon again stopped , and this time just before me . "
152200	152211	152196	152196	you	146	" he stooped and approached his lips to my ear ; "
152224	152391	152219	152219	I	0	" His voice was hoarse ; his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond and plunge headlong into wild license . I saw that in another moment , and with one impetus of frenzy more , I should be able to do nothing with him . The present - the passing second of time - was all I had in which to control and restrain him - a movement of repulsion , flight , fear would have sealed my doom , - and his . But I was not afraid : not in the least . I felt an inward power ; a sense of influence , which supported me . The crisis was perilous ; but not without its charm : such as the Indian , perhaps , feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe . I took hold of his clenched hand , loosened the contorted fingers , and said to him , soothingly - "
152419	152529	152395	152395	I	0	" He sat down : but he did not get leave to speak directly . I had been struggling with tears for some time : I had taken great pains to repress them , because I knew he would not like to see me weep . Now , however , I considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked . If the flood annoyed him , so much the better . So I gave way and cried heartily . Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed . I said I could not while he was in such a passion . "
152576	152626	152627	152627	Jane	146	" His softened voice announced that he was subdued ; so I , in my turn , became calm . Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder , but I would not permit it . Then he would draw me to him : no . "
152631	152650	152651	152651	you	146	" he said , in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled along every nerve I had ; "
152701	152756	152687	152687	you	146	" These words cut me : yet what could I do or I say ? I ought probably to have done or said nothing ; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at thus hurting his feelings , I could not control the wish to drop balm where I had wounded . "
152762	152766	152757	152757	I	0	" I said , "

To agitate him thus deeply , by a resistance he so abhorred , was cruel : to yield was out of the question . I did what human beings do instinctively when they are driven to utter extremity - looked for aid to one higher than man : the words "
153324	153331	153221	153221	your	146	" burst involuntarily from my lips . "

154376	154511	154368	154368	I	0	" Jane , I will not trouble you with abominable details : some strong words shall express what I have to say . I lived with that woman upstairs four years , and before that time she had tried me indeed : her character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity ; her vices sprang up fast and rank : they were so strong , only cruelty could check them , and I would not use cruelty . What a pigmy intellect she had , and what giant propensities ! How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on me ! Bertha Mason , the true daughter of an infamous mother , dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste . "

155052	155285	155292	155292	I	0	" One night I had been awakened by her yells - since the medical men had pronounced her mad , she had , of course , been shut up - it was a fiery West Indian night ; one of the description that frequently precede the hurricanes of those climates . Being unable to sleep in bed , I got up and opened the window . The air was like sulphur - steams - I could find no refreshment anywhere . Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room ; the sea , which I could hear from thence , rumbled dull like an earthquake - black clouds were casting up over it ; the moon was setting in the waves , broad and red , like a hot cannon - ball - she threw her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of tempest . I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene , and my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out ; wherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon - hate , with such language ! - no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she : though two rooms off , I heard every word - the thin partitions of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries . "
155381	155450	155352	155352	I	0	" I said this whilst I knelt down at , and unlocked a trunk which contained a brace of loaded pistols : I mean to shoot myself . I only entertained the intention for a moment ; for , not being insane , the crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair , which had originated the wish and design of self - destruction , was past in a second . "
155558	155659	155665	155665	Hope	232	" The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves , and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty ; my heart , dried up and scorched for a long time , swelled to the tone , and filled with living blood - my being longed for renewal - my soul thirsted for a pure draught . I saw hope revive - and felt regeneration possible . From a flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea - bluer than the sky : the old world was beyond ; clear prospects opened thus:- "
155838	155965	155971	155971	I	0	" I acted precisely on this suggestion . My father and brother had not made my marriage known to their acquaintance ; because , in the very first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union - having already begun to experience extreme disgust of its consequences , and , from the family character and constitution , seeing a hideous future opening to me - I added an urgent charge to keep it secret : and very soon the infamous conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him blush to own her as his daughter - in - law . Far from desiring to publish the connection , he became as anxious to conceal it as myself . "
156367	156368	156384	156384	you	4374	" "
156374	156382	156384	156384	you	4374	" I asked , while he paused , "

157058	157244	157054	157054	I	0	" Yet I could not live alone ; so I tried the companionship of mistresses . The first I chose was Celine Varens - another of those steps which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them . You already know what she was , and how my liaison with her terminated . She had two successors : an Italian , Giacinta , and a German , Clara ; both considered singularly handsome . What was their beauty to me in a few weeks ? Giacinta was unprincipled and violent : I tired of her in three months . Clara was honest and quiet ; but heavy , mindless , and unimpressible : not one whit to my taste . I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a good line of business , and so get decently rid of her . But , Jane , I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now . You think me an unfeeling , loose - principled rake : do n't you ? "
157245	157298	157383	157383	I	0	" I do n't like you so well as I have done sometimes , indeed , sir . Did it not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way , first with one mistress and then another ? You talk of it as a mere matter of course . "
157299	157382	157383	157383	I	0	" It was with me ; and I did not like it . It was a grovelling fashion of existence : I should never like to return to it . Hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave : both are often by nature , and always by position , inferior : and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading . I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine , Giacinta , and Clara . "
157502	157618	157479	157479	I	0	" Now , Jane , why do n't you say ' Well , sir ? ' I have not done . You are looking grave . You disapprove of me still , I see . But let me come to the point . Last January , rid of all mistresses - in a harsh , bitter frame of mind , the result of a useless , roving , lonely life - corroded with disappointment , sourly disposed against all men , and especially against all womankind for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual , faithful , loving woman as a mere dream , recalled by business , I came back to England . "
157807	158293	158295	158295	I	0	" When once I had pressed the frail shoulder , something new - a fresh sap and sense - stole into my frame . It was well I had learnt that this elf must return to me - that it belonged to my house down below - or I could not have felt it pass away from under my hand , and seen it vanish behind the dim hedge , without singular regret . I heard you come home that night , Jane , though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or watched for you . The next day I observed you - myself unseen - for half - an - hour , while you played with Adele in the gallery . It was a snowy day , I recollect , and you could not go out of doors . I was in my room ; the door was ajar : I could both listen and watch . Adele claimed your outward attention for a while ; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere : but you were very patient with her , my little Jane ; you talked to her and amused her a long time . When at last she left you , you lapsed at once into deep reverie : you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery . Now and then , in passing a casement , you glanced out at the thick - falling snow ; you listened to the sobbing wind , and again you paced gently on and dreamed . I think those day visions were not dark : there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally , a soft excitement in your aspect , which told of no bitter , bilious , hypochondriac brooding : your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven . The voice of Mrs. Fairfax , speaking to a servant in the hall , wakened you : and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself , Janet ! There was much sense in your smile : it was very shrewd , and seemed to make light of your own abstraction . It seemed to say - ' My fine visions are all very well , but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal . I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain ; but without , I am perfectly aware , lies at my feet a rough tract to travel , and around me gather black tempests to encounter . ' You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation : the weekly house accounts to make up , or something of that sort , I think it was . I was vexed with you for getting out of my sight . "
158800	159015	158780	158780	you	3190	" I resumed my notice of you . There was something glad in your glance , and genial in your manner , when you conversed : I saw you had a social heart ; it was the silent schoolroom - it was the tedium of your life - that made you mournful . I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you ; kindness stirred emotion soon : your face became soft in expression , your tones gentle ; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent . I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you , Jane , at this time : there was a curious hesitation in your manner : you glanced at me with a slight trouble - a hovering doubt : you did not know what my caprice might be - whether I was going to play the master and be stern , or the friend and be benignant . I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first whim ; and , when I stretched my hand out cordially , such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young , wistful features , I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and there to my heart . "
159016	159028	159029	159029	I	0	" Do n't talk any more of those days , sir , "
159078	159083	159084	159084	he	3197	" No , Jane , "
159087	159112	159084	159084	he	3197	" what necessity is there to dwell on the Past , when the Present is so much surer - the Future so much brighter ? "
159121	159134	159135	159135	he	3197	" You see now how the case stands - do you not ? "
159138	159254	159135	159135	he	3197	" After a youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary solitude , I have for the first time found what I can truly love - I have found you . You are my sympathy - my better self - my good angel . I am bound to you with a strong attachment . I think you good , gifted , lovely : a fervent , a solemn passion is conceived in my heart ; it leans to you , draws you to my centre and spring of life , wraps my existence about you , and , kindling in pure , powerful flame , fuses you and me in one . "
159432	159436	159425	159425	Jane	146	" A pause . "
159444	159515	159439	159439	you	146	" I was experiencing an ordeal : a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals . Terrible moment : full of struggle , blackness , burning ! Not a human being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved ; and him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped : and I must renounce love and idol . One drear word comprised my intolerable duty - "

His fury was wrought to the highest : he must yield to it for a moment , whatever followed ; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my waist . He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance : physically , I felt , at the moment , powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow of a furnace : mentally , I still possessed my soul , and with it the certainty of ultimate safety . The soul , fortunately , has an interpreter - often an unconscious , but still a truthful interpreter - in the eye . My eye rose to his ; and while I looked in his fierce face I gave an involuntary sigh ; his gripe was painful , and my over - taxed strength almost exhausted . "

The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain : only an idiot , however , would have succumbed now . I had dared and baffled his fury ; I must elude his sorrow : I retired to the door . "

161018	161087	160976	160976	Jane	146	" broke in anguish from his lips . Then came a deep , strong sob . I had already gained the door ; but , reader , I walked back - walked back as determinedly as I had retreated . I knelt down by him ; I turned his face from the cushion to me ; I kissed his cheek ; I smoothed his hair with my hand . "

161208	161223	161152	161152	Jane	395	" was the cry of my heart as I left him . Despair added , "
161228	161457	161458	161459	My daughter	5378	" That night I never thought to sleep ; but a slumber fell on me as soon as I lay down in bed . I was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood : I dreamt I lay in the red - room at Gateshead ; that the night was dark , and my mind impressed with strange fears . The light that long ago had struck me into syncope , recalled in this vision , seemed glidingly to mount the wall , and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling . I lifted up my head to look : the roof resolved to clouds , high and dim ; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about to sever . I watched her come - watched with the strangest anticipation ; as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk . She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud : a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away ; then , not a moon , but a white human form shone in the azure , inclining a glorious brow earthward . It gazed and gazed on me . It spoke to my spirit : immeasurably distant was the tone , yet so near , it whispered in my heart - "

161471	161504	161468	161468	I	0	" So I answered after I had waked from the trance - like dream . It was yet night , but July nights are short : soon after midnight , dawn comes . "
161520	161663	161468	161468	I	0	" thought I. I rose : I was dressed ; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes . I knew where to find in my drawers some linen , a locket , a ring . In seeking these articles , I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago . I left that ; it was not mine : it was the visionary bride 's who had melted in air . The other articles I made up in a parcel ; my purse , containing twenty shillings it was all I had , I put in my pocket : I tied on my straw bonnet , pinned my shawl , took the parcel and my slippers , which I would not put on yet , and stole from my room . "
161670	161681	161666	161668	kind Mrs. Fairfax	180	" I whispered , as I glided past her door . "
161688	161814	161815	161816	Mr. Rochester	251	" I said , as I glanced towards the nursery . No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her . I had to deceive a fine ear : for aught I knew it might now be listening . I would have got past Mr. Rochester 's chamber without a pause ; but my heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold , my foot was forced to stop also . No sleep was there : the inmate was walking restlessly from wall to wall ; and again and again he sighed while I listened . There was a heaven - a temporary heaven - in this room for me , if I chose : I had but to go in and to say - "
161831	165062	161815	161816	Mr. Rochester	251	" and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips . I thought of this . That kind master , who could not sleep now , was waiting with impatience for day . He would send for me in the morning ; I should be gone . He would have me sought for : vainly . He would feel himself forsaken ; his love rejected : he would suffer ; perhaps grow desperate . I thought of this too . My hand moved towards the lock : I caught it back , and glided on . Drearily I wound my way downstairs : I knew what I had to do , and I did it mechanically . I sought the key of the side - door in the kitchen ; I sought , too , a phial of oil and a feather ; I oiled the key and the lock . I got some water , I got some bread : for perhaps I should have to walk far ; and my strength , sorely shaken of late , must not break down . All this I did without one sound . I opened the door , passed out , shut it softly . Dim dawn glimmered in the yard . The great gates were closed and locked ; but a wicket in one of them was only latched . Through that I departed : it , too , I shut ; and now I was out of Thornfield . A mile off , beyond the fields , lay a road which stretched in the contrary direction to Millcote ; a road I had never travelled , but often noticed , and wondered where it led : thither I bent my steps . No reflection was to be allowed now : not one glance was to be cast back ; not even one forward . Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future . The first was a page so heavenly sweet - so deadly sad - that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy . The last was an awful blank : something like the world when the deluge was gone by . I skirted fields , and hedges , and lanes till after sunrise . I believe it was a lovely summer morning : I know my shoes , which I had put on when I left the house , were soon wet with dew . But I looked neither to rising sun , nor smiling sky , nor wakening nature . He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold , thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road , but of the block and axe - edge ; of the disseverment of bone and vein ; of the grave gaping at the end : and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering - and oh ! with agony I thought of what I left . I could not help it . I thought of him now - in his room - watching the sunrise ; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and be his . I longed to be his ; I panted to return : it was not too late ; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement . As yet my flight , I was sure , was undiscovered . I could go back and be his comforter - his pride ; his redeemer from misery , perhaps from ruin . Oh , that fear of his self - abandonment - far worse than my abandonment - how it goaded me ! It was a barbed arrow - head in my breast ; it tore me when I tried to extract it ; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in . Birds began singing in brake and copse : birds were faithful to their mates ; birds were emblems of love . What was I ? In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle , I abhorred myself . I had no solace from self- approbation : none even from self - respect . I had injured - wounded - left my master . I was hateful in my own eyes . Still I could not turn , nor retrace one step . God must have led me on . As to my own will or conscience , impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled the other . I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way : fast , fast I went like one delirious . A weakness , beginning inwardly , extending to the limbs , seized me , and I fell : I lay on the ground some minutes , pressing my face to the wet turf . I had some fear - or hope - that here I should die : but I was soon up ; crawling forwards on my hands and knees , and then again raised to my feet - as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road . When I got there , I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge ; and while I sat , I heard wheels , and saw a coach come on . I stood up and lifted my hand ; it stopped . I asked where it was going : the driver named a place a long way off , and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no connections . I asked for what sum he would take me there ; he said thirty shillings ; I answered I had but twenty ; well , he would try to make it do . He further gave me leave to get into the inside , as the vehicle was empty : I entered , was shut in , and it rolled on its way . Gentle reader , may you never feel what I then felt ! May your eyes never shed such stormy , scalding , heart - wrung tears as poured from mine . May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in that hour left my lips ; for never may you , like me , dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love . CHAPTER XXVIII Two days are passed . It is a summer evening ; the coachman has set me down at a place called Whitcross ; he could take me no farther for the sum I had given , and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world . The coach is a mile off by this time ; I am alone . At this moment I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach , where I had placed it for safety ; there it remains , there it must remain ; and now , I am absolutely destitute . Whitcross is no town , nor even a hamlet ; it is but a stone pillar set up where four roads meet : whitewashed , I suppose , to be more obvious at a distance and in darkness . Four arms spring from its summit : the nearest town to which these point is , according to the inscription , distant ten miles ; the farthest , above twenty . From the well - known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted ; a north - midland shire , dusk with moorland , ridged with mountain : this I see . There are great moors behind and on each hand of me ; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet . The population here must be thin , and I see no passengers on these roads : they stretch out east , west , north , and south - white , broad , lonely ; they are all cut in the moor , and the heather grows deep and wild to their very verge . Yet a chance traveller might pass by ; and I wish no eye to see me now : strangers would wonder what I am doing , lingering here at the sign - post , evidently objectless and lost . I might be questioned : I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion . Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment - not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow - creatures are - none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me . I have no relative but the universal mother , Nature : I will seek her breast and ask repose . I struck straight into the heath ; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside ; I waded knee - deep in its dark growth ; I turned with its turnings , and finding a moss - blackened granite crag in a hidden angle , I sat down under it . High banks of moor were about me ; the crag protected my head : the sky was over that . Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here : I had a vague dread that wild cattle might be near , or that some sportsman or poacher might discover me . If a gust of wind swept the waste , I looked up , fearing it was the rush of a bull ; if a plover whistled , I imagined it a man . Finding my apprehensions unfounded , however , and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall , I took confidence . As yet I had not thought ; I had only listened , watched , dreaded ; now I regained the faculty of reflection . What was I to do ? Where to go ? Oh , intolerable questions , when I could do nothing and go nowhere ! - when a long way must yet be measured by my weary , trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation - when cold charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging : reluctant sympathy importuned , almost certain repulse incurred , before my tale could be listened to , or one of my wants relieved ! I touched the heath , it was dry , and yet warm with the beat of the summer day . I looked at the sky ; it was pure : a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge . The dew fell , but with propitious softness ; no breeze whispered . Nature seemed to me benign and good ; I thought she loved me , outcast as I was ; and I , who from man could anticipate only mistrust , rejection , insult , clung to her with filial fondness . To - night , at least , I would be her guest , as I was her child : my mother would lodge me without money and without price . I had one morsel of bread yet : the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny - my last coin . I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there , like jet beads in the heath : I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread . My hunger , sharp before , was , if not satisfied , appeased by this hermit 's meal . I said my evening prayers at its conclusion , and then chose my couch . Beside the crag the heath was very deep : when I lay down my feet were buried in it ; rising high on each side , it left only a narrow space for the night - air to invade . I folded my shawl double , and spread it over me for a coverlet ; a low , mossy swell was my pillow . Thus lodged , I was not , at least - at the commencement of the night , cold . My rest might have been blissful enough , only a sad heart broke it . It plained of its gaping wounds , its inward bleeding , its riven chords . It trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom ; it bemoaned him with bitter pity ; it demanded him with ceaseless longing ; and , impotent as a bird with both wings broken , it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him . Worn out with this torture of thought , I rose to my knees . Night was come , and her planets were risen : a safe , still night : too serene for the companionship of fear . We know that God is everywhere ; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us ; and it is in the unclouded night - sky , where His worlds wheel their silent course , that we read clearest His infinitude , His omnipotence , His omnipresence . I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester . Looking up , I , with tear - dimmed eyes , saw the mighty Milky - way . Remembering what it was - what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light - I felt the might and strength of God . Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made : convinced I grew that neither earth should perish , nor one of the souls it treasured . I turned my prayer to thanksgiving : the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits . Mr. Rochester was safe ; he was God 's , and by God would he be guarded . I again nestled to the breast of the hill ; and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow . But next day , Want came to me pale and bare . Long after the little birds had left their nests ; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried - when the long morning shadows were curtailed , and the sun filled earth and sky - I got up , and I looked round me . What a still , hot , perfect day ! What a golden desert this spreading moor ! Everywhere sunshine . I wished I could live in it and on it . I saw a lizard run over the crag ; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries . I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard , that I might have found fitting nutriment , permanent shelter here . But I was a human being , and had a human being 's wants : I must not linger where there was nothing to supply them . I rose ; I looked back at the bed I had left . Hopeless of the future , I wished but this - that my Maker had that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept ; and that this weary frame , absolved by death from further conflict with fate , had now but to decay quietly , and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness . Life , however , was yet in my possession , with all its requirements , and pains , and responsibilities . The burden must be carried ; the want provided for ; the suffering endured ; the responsibility fulfilled . I set out . Whitcross regained , I followed a road which led from the sun , now fervent and high . By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice . I walked a long time , and when I thought I had nearly done enough , and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered me - might relax this forced action , and , sitting down on a stone I saw near , submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb - I heard a bell chime - a church bell . I turned in the direction of the sound , and there , amongst the romantic hills , whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago , I saw a hamlet and a spire . All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture - fields , and cornfields , and wood ; and a glittering stream ran zig - zag through the varied shades of green , the mellowing grain , the sombre woodland , the clear and sunny lea . Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me , I saw a heavily - laden waggon labouring up the hill , and not far beyond were two cows and their drover . Human life and human labour were near . I must struggle on : strive to live and bend to toil like the rest . About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village . At the bottom of its one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window . I coveted a cake of bread . With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a degree of energy : without it , it would be difficult to proceed . The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my fellow - beings . I felt it would be degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet . Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls ? I considered . I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat ; I had my gloves . I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded . I did not know whether either of these articles would be accepted : probably they would not ; but I must try . I entered the shop : a woman was there . Seeing a respectably - dressed person , a lady as she supposed , she came forward with civility . How could she serve me ? I was seized with shame : my tongue would not utter the request I had prepared . I dared not offer her the half - worn gloves , the creased handkerchief : besides , I felt it would be absurd . I only begged permission to sit down a moment , as I was tired . Disappointed in the expectation of a customer , she coolly acceded to my request . She pointed to a seat ; I sank into it . I felt sorely urged to weep ; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be , I restrained it . Soon I asked her "
165076	165077	165066	165067	any dressmaker	3235	" "
165093	165147	165149	165149	she	3238	" I reflected . I was driven to the point now . I was brought face to face with Necessity . I stood in the position of one without a resource , without a friend , without a coin . I must do something . What ? I must apply somewhere . Where ? "
165163	165164	165149	165149	she	3238	" "
165172	165173	165167	165167	she	3238	" "
165191	165192	165193	165193	Some	1182	" "
165215	165216	165203	165204	Mr. Oliver	399	" "
165223	165224	165218	165219	Mr. Oliver	399	" "
165233	165234	165229	165229	men	482	" "
165242	165243	165238	165239	the women	3250	" "
165247	165252	165244	165244	I	0	" was the answer . "
165271	165540	165268	165268	they	3252	" She seemed to be tired of my questions : and , indeed , what claim had I to importune her ? A neighbour or two came in ; my chair was evidently wanted . I took leave . I passed up the street , looking as I went at all the houses to the right hand and to the left ; but I could discover no pretext , nor see an inducement to enter any . I rambled round the hamlet , going sometimes to a little distance and returning again , for an hour or more . Much exhausted , and suffering greatly now for want of food , I turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge . Ere many minutes had elapsed , I was again on my feet , however , and again searching something - a resource , or at least an informant . A pretty little house stood at the top of the lane , with a garden before it , exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming . I stopped at it . What business had I to approach the white door or touch the glittering knocker ? In what way could it possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me ? Yet I drew near and knocked . A mild - looking , cleanly - attired young woman opened the door . In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame - a voice wretchedly low and faltering - I asked if a servant was wanted here ? "
165543	165547	165268	165268	they	3252	" said she ; "
165555	165556	165552	165553	a servant	4337	" "
165570	165574	165558	165558	you	3255	" I continued . "
165595	165639	165558	165558	you	3255	" But it was not her business to think for me , or to seek a place for me : besides , in her eyes , how doubtful must have appeared my character , position , tale . She shook her head , she "
165649	166013	165642	165642	she	3255	" and the white door closed , quite gently and civilly : but it shut me out . If she had held it open a little longer , I believe I should have begged a piece of bread ; for I was now brought low . I could not bear to return to the sordid village , where , besides , no prospect of aid was visible . I should have longed rather to deviate to a wood I saw not far off , which appeared in its thick shade to offer inviting shelter ; but I was so sick , so weak , so gnawed with nature 's cravings , instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance of food . Solitude would be no solitude - rest no rest - while the vulture , hunger , thus sank beak and talons in my side . I drew near houses ; I left them , and came back again , and again I wandered away : always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask - no right to expect interest in my isolated lot . Meantime , the afternoon advanced , while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog . In crossing a field , I saw the church spire before me : I hastened towards it . Near the churchyard , and in the middle of a garden , stood a well - built though small house , which I had no doubt was the parsonage . I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no friends , and who want employment , sometimes apply to the clergyman for introduction and aid . It is the clergyman 's function to help - at least with advice - those who wished to help themselves . I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here . Renewing then my courage , and gathering my feeble remains of strength , I pushed on . I reached the house , and knocked at the kitchen - door . An old woman opened : I asked was this the parsonage ? "
166016	166017	165642	165642	she	3255	" "
166023	166024	166019	166020	the clergyman	6499	" "
166027	166028	166019	166020	the clergyman	6499	" "
166035	166036	166019	166020	the clergyman	6499	" "
166045	166046	166039	166039	he	6499	" "
166051	166052	166039	166039	he	6499	" "
166091	166092	166074	166074	he	6499	" "
166101	166102	166095	166099	any lady of the house	3262	" "
166116	166225	166112	166112	she	3262	" and of her , reader , I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was sinking ; I could not yet beg ; and again I crawled away . Once more I took off my handkerchief - once more I thought of the cakes of bread in the little shop . Oh , for but a crust ! for but one mouthful to allay the pang of famine ! Instinctively I turned my face again to the village ; I found the shop again , and I went in ; and though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request - "
166236	166245	166227	166227	she	3265	" She looked at me with evident suspicion : "
166257	166272	166248	166248	she	3265	" Almost desperate , I asked for half a cake ; she again refused . "
166284	166288	166275	166275	she	3265	" she said . "
166295	166296	166290	166290	she	3265	" "
166306	166542	166301	166301	she	3265	" Reader , it is not pleasant to dwell on these details . Some say there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past ; but at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude : the moral degradation , blent with the physical suffering , form too distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on . I blamed none of those who repulsed me . I felt it was what was to be expected , and what could not be helped : an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion ; a well - dressed beggar inevitably so . To be sure , what I begged was employment ; but whose business was it to provide me with employment ? Not , certainly , that of persons who saw me then for the first time , and who knew nothing about my character . And as to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread , why , she was right , if the offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable . Let me condense now . I am sick of the subject . A little before dark I passed a farm - house , at the open door of which the farmer was sitting , eating his supper of bread and cheese . I stopped and said - "
166558	166790	166544	166544	you	3266	" He cast on me a glance of surprise ; but without answering , he cut a thick slice from his loaf , and gave it to me . I imagine he did not think I was a beggar , but only an eccentric sort of lady , who had taken a fancy to his brown loaf . As soon as I was out of sight of his house , I sat down and ate it . I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof , and sought it in the wood I have before alluded to . But my night was wretched , my rest broken : the ground was damp , the air cold : besides , intruders passed near me more than once , and I had again and again to change my quarters ; no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me . Towards morning it rained ; the whole of the following day was wet . Do not ask me , reader , to give a minute account of that day ; as before , I sought work ; as before , I was repulsed ; as before , I starved ; but once did food pass my lips . At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough . "
166797	166806	166792	166792	you	3267	" I asked . She stared at me . "
166809	166813	166816	166817	a woman	4399	" she exclaimed , "
166826	166827	166816	166817	a woman	4399	" "
166831	166837	166816	166817	a woman	4399	" replied a voice within , "
166855	166897	166898	166898	My	0	" The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand , and I devoured it ravenously . As the wet twilight deepened , I stopped in a solitary bridle - path , which I had been pursuing an hour or more . "
166905	166912	166913	166913	I	0	" I said in a soliloquy . "
167075	167164	167061	167061	Providence	272	" My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape . I saw I had strayed far from the village : it was quite out of sight . The very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared . I had , by cross - ways and by - paths , once more drawn near the tract of moorland ; and now , only a few fields , almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed , lay between me and the dusky hill . "
167182	167186	167167	167167	I	0	" I reflected . "
167230	167378	167167	167167	I	0	" To the hill , then , I turned . I reached it . It remained now only to find a hollow where I could lie down , and feel at least hidden , if not secure . But all the surface of the waste looked level . It showed no variation but of tint : green , where rush and moss overgrew the marshes ; black , where the dry soil bore only heath . Dark as it was getting , I could still see these changes , though but as mere alternations of light and shade ; for colour had faded with the daylight . My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor - edge , vanishing amidst the wildest scenery , when at one dim point , far in among the marshes and the ridges , a light sprang up . "
167385	167413	167167	167167	I	0	" was my first thought ; and I expected it would soon vanish . It burnt on , however , quite steadily , neither receding nor advancing . "
167424	167452	167167	167167	I	0	" I questioned . I watched to see whether it would spread : but no ; as it did not diminish , so it did not enlarge . "
167462	167467	167167	167167	I	0	" I then conjectured ; "
167514	168466	168469	168469	Diana	400	" And I sank down where I stood , and hid my face against the ground . I lay still a while : the night - wind swept over the hill and over me , and died moaning in the distance ; the rain fell fast , wetting me afresh to the skin . Could I but have stiffened to the still frost - the friendly numbness of death - it might have pelted on ; I should not have felt it ; but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence . I rose ere long . The light was yet there , shining dim but constant through the rain . I tried to walk again : I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it . It led me aslant over the hill , through a wide bog , which would have been impassable in winter , and was splashy and shaking even now , in the height of summer . Here I fell twice ; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties . This light was my forlorn hope : I must gain it . Having crossed the marsh , I saw a trace of white over the moor . I approached it ; it was a road or a track : it led straight up to the light , which now beamed from a sort of knoll , amidst a clump of trees - firs , apparently , from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom . My star vanished as I drew near : some obstacle had intervened between me and it . I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me : I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall - above it , something like palisades , and within , a high and prickly hedge . I groped on . Again a whitish object gleamed before me : it was a gate - a wicket ; it moved on its hinges as I touched it . On each side stood a sable bush - holly or yew . Entering the gate and passing the shrubs , the silhouette of a house rose to view , black , low , and rather long ; but the guiding light shone nowhere . All was obscurity . Were the inmates retired to rest ? I feared it must be so . In seeking the door , I turned an angle : there shot out the friendly gleam again , from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window , within a foot of the ground , made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant , whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set . The aperture was so screened and narrow , that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary ; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it , I could see all within . I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor , clean scoured ; a dresser of walnut , with pewter plates ranged in rows , reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat - fire . I could see a clock , a white deal table , some chairs . The candle , whose ray had been my beacon , burnt on the table ; and by its light an elderly woman , somewhat rough - looking , but scrupulously clean , like all about her , was knitting a stocking . I noticed these objects cursorily only - in them there was nothing extraordinary . A group of more interest appeared near the hearth , sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it . Two young , graceful women - ladies in every point - sat , one in a low rocking - chair , the other on a lower stool ; both wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen , which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces : a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girl - in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat . A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants ! Who were they ? They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table ; for she looked like a rustic , and they were all delicacy and cultivation . I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs : and yet , as I gazed on them , I seemed intimate with every lineament . I can not call them handsome - they were too pale and grave for the word : as they each bent over a book , they looked thoughtful almost to severity . A stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes , to which they frequently referred , comparing them , seemingly , with the smaller books they held in their hands , like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in the task of translation . This scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture : so hushed was it , I could hear the cinders fall from the grate , the clock tick in its obscure corner ; and I even fancied I could distinguish the click - click of the woman 's knitting - needles . When , therefore , a voice broke the strange stillness at last , it was audible enough to me . "
168471	168479	168469	168469	Diana	400	" said one of the absorbed students ; "
168508	168552	168493	168493	Franz	401	" And in a low voice she read something , of which not one word was intelligible to me ; for it was in an unknown tongue - neither French nor Latin . Whether it were Greek or German I could not tell . "
168557	168566	168493	168493	Franz	401	" she said , when she had finished : "
168571	168649	168493	168493	Franz	401	" The other girl , who had lifted her head to listen to her sister , repeated , while she gazed at the fire , a line of what had been read . At a later day , I knew the language and the book ; therefore , I will here quote the line : though , when I first heard it , it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to me - conveying no meaning:- "
168667	168679	168493	168493	Franz	401	" she exclaimed , while her dark and deep eye sparkled . "
168727	168733	168723	168723	I	0	" Both were again silent . "
168746	168758	168739	168739	they	3281	" asked the old woman , looking up from her knitting . "
168778	168779	168771	168771	they	3281	" "
168816	168817	168806	168806	ye	3279	" "
168864	168865	168845	168845	We	3284	" "
168874	168875	168845	168845	We	3284	" "
168906	168907	168908	168908	Varry	403	" "
168924	168925	168928	168928	we	3284	" "
168942	168943	168944	168944	Mortally	404	" "
168965	168966	168944	168944	Mortally	404	" "
168990	168991	168984	168985	St. John	360	" "
169036	169071	169020	169020	Hannah	233	" The woman rose : she opened a door , through which I dimly saw a passage : soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room ; she presently came back . "
169076	169080	169020	169020	Hannah	233	" said she , "
169109	169129	169167	169167	You	3295	" She wiped her eyes with her apron : the two girls , grave before , looked sad now . "
169138	169142	169167	169167	You	3295	" continued Hannah : "
169165	169166	169167	169167	You	3295	" "
169174	169181	169169	169169	he	3291	" inquired one of the ladies . "
169360	169457	169353	169353	Diana	400	" I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant for such I now concluded her to be saw the difference . Both were fair complexioned and slenderly made ; both possessed faces full of distinction and intelligence . One , to be sure , had hair a shade darker than the other , and there was a difference in their style of wearing it ; Mary 's pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth : Diana 's duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls . The clock struck ten . "
169467	169471	169463	169463	I	0	" observed Hannah ; "
169483	169630	169475	169477	Mr. St. John	177	" And she proceeded to prepare the meal . The ladies rose ; they seemed about to withdraw to the parlour . Till this moment , I had been so intent on watching them , their appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest , I had half - forgotten my own wretched position : now it recurred to me . More desolate , more desperate than ever , it seemed from contrast . And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf ; to make them believe in the truth of my wants and woes - to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings ! As I groped out the door , and knocked at it hesitatingly , I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera . Hannah opened . "
169636	169659	169633	169633	you	3303	" she inquired , in a voice of surprise , as she surveyed me by the light of the candle she held . "
169667	169671	169661	169661	I	0	" I said . "
169691	169692	169687	169687	you	3303	" "
169698	169699	169695	169696	a stranger	799	" "
169709	169710	169711	169711	I	0	" "
169733	169748	169749	169749	I	0	" Distrust , the very feeling I dreaded , appeared in Hannah 's face . "
169758	169766	169749	169749	I	0	" she said , after a pause ; "
169783	169784	169798	169798	I.	0	" "
169793	169794	169798	169798	I.	0	" "

169917	169918	169920	169922	the young ladies	4509	" "

170036	170170	170027	170028	a gentleman	638	" Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and bolted it within . This was the climax . A pang of exquisite suffering - a throe of true despair - rent and heaved my heart . Worn out , indeed , I was ; not another step could I stir . I sank on the wet doorstep : I groaned - I wrung my hands - I wept in utter anguish . Oh , this spectre of death ! Oh , this last hour , approaching in such horror ! Alas , this isolation - this banishment from my kind ! Not only the anchor of hope , but the footing of fortitude was gone - at least for a moment ; but the last I soon endeavoured to regain . "
170176	170180	170171	170171	I	0	" I said , "
170197	170233	170188	170188	me	0	" These words I not only thought , but uttered ; and thrusting back all my misery into my heart , I made an effort to compel it to remain there - dumb and still . "
170239	170248	170188	170188	me	0	" said a voice quite close at hand ; "
170274	170275	170264	170264	yours	3321	" "
170281	170341	170264	170264	yours	3321	" I asked , terrified at the unexpected sound , and incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid . A form was near - what form , the pitch - dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented me from distinguishing . With a loud long knock , the new - comer appealed to the door . "
170350	170354	170344	170344	you	3322	" cried Hannah . "
170362	170363	170344	170344	you	3322	" "
170435	170436	170432	170432	I	0	" "
170509	170573	170496	170497	Young woman	3327	" With difficulty I obeyed him . Presently I stood within that clean , bright kitchen - on the very hearth - trembling , sickening ; conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly , wild , and weather - beaten . The two ladies , their brother , Mr. St. John , the old servant , were all gazing at me . "
170581	170587	170574	170575	St. John	177	" I heard one ask . "
170600	170605	170593	170593	I	0	" was the reply . "
170611	170615	170606	170606	She	3327	" said Hannah . "
170623	170627	170606	170606	She	3327	" was responded . "
170636	170666	170606	170606	She	3327	" And indeed my head swam : I dropped , but a chair received me . I still possessed my senses , though just now I could not speak . "
170696	170697	170698	170700	A mere spectre	3329	" "
170702	170703	170698	170700	A mere spectre	3329	" "
170712	170713	170716	170716	I	0	" "
170735	170812	170698	170700	A mere spectre	3329	" Diana I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as she bent over me broke some bread , dipped it in milk , and put it to my lips . Her face was near mine : I saw there was pity in it , and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing . In her simple words , too , the same balm - like emotion spoke : "
170817	170818	170716	170716	I	0	" "
170823	170855	170716	170716	I	0	" repeated Mary gently ; and Mary 's hand removed my sodden bonnet and lifted my head . I tasted what they offered me : feebly at first , eagerly soon . "
170865	170876	170878	170878	he	3331	" said the brother ; ' she has had enough . "
170890	170906	170878	170878	he	3331	" A little more , St. John - look at the avidity in her eyes . "
170907	170927	170928	170928	I	0	" No more at present , sister . Try if she can speak now - ask her her name . "
170938	170945	170935	170935	I	0	" My name is Jane Elliott . "
170962	170974	170975	170975	I	0	" And where do you live ? Where are your friends ? "
170979	170989	170975	170975	I	0	" Can we send for any one you know ? "
170995	171004	170990	170990	I	0	" What account can you give of yourself ? "
171096	171109	171089	171089	I	0	" Sir , I can give you no details to - night . "
171110	171116	171118	171118	he	177	" But what , then , "
171120	171130	171118	171118	he	177	" do you expect me to do for you ? "
171131	171134	171135	171135	I	0	" Nothing , "
171151	171156	171157	171157	she	400	" Do you mean , "
171160	171186	171157	171157	she	400	" that we have now given you what aid you require ? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night ? "
171225	171295	171222	171222	I	0	" I will trust you . If I were a masterless and stray dog , I know that you would not turn me from your hearth to - night : as it is , I really have no fear . Do with me and for me as you like ; but excuse me from much discourse - my breath is short - I feel a spasm when I speak . "
171307	171310	171312	171314	Mr. St. John	177	" Hannah , "
171319	171364	171312	171314	Mr. St. John	177	" let her sit there at present , and ask her no questions ; in ten minutes more , give her the remainder of that milk and bread . Mary and Diana , let us go into the parlour and talk the matter over . "
171684	171694	171673	171673	They	3349	" It is very well we took her in . "
171695	171727	171673	171673	They	3349	" Yes ; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had she been left out all night . I wonder what she has gone through ? "
171728	171742	171673	171673	They	3349	" Strange hardships , I imagine - poor , emaciated , pallid wanderer ? "
171743	171785	171673	171673	They	3349	" She is not an uneducated person , I should think , by her manner of speaking ; her accent was quite pure ; and the clothes she took off , though splashed and wet , were little worn and fine . "
171786	171822	171826	171826	their	3349	" She has a peculiar face ; fleshless and haggard as it is , I rather like it ; and when in good health and animated , I can fancy her physiognomy would be agreeable . "
171985	172000	171952	171952	he	177	" Rather an unusual physiognomy ; certainly , not indicative of vulgarity or degradation . "
172001	172005	172007	172007	Diana	400	" Far otherwise , "
172009	172038	172007	172007	Diana	400	" To speak truth , St. John , my heart rather warms to the poor little soul . I wish we may be able to benefit her permanently . "
172039	172045	171952	171952	he	177	" That is hardly likely , "
172050	172110	172111	172111	He	3353	" You will find she is some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends , and has probably injudiciously left them . We may , perhaps , succeed in restoring her to them , if she is not obstinate : but I trace lines of force in her face which make me sceptical of her tractability . "
172121	172132	172111	172111	He	3353	" She looks sensible , but not at all handsome . "
172133	172142	172111	172111	He	3353	" She is so ill , St. John . "
172143	172167	172111	172111	He	3353	" Ill or well , she would always be plain . The grace and harmony of beauty are quite wanting in those features . "
172589	172597	172598	172598	she	233	" What , you have got up ! "
172601	172624	172625	172625	She	233	" You are better , then . You may sit you down in my chair on the hearthstone , if you will . "
172671	172684	172667	172667	she	233	" Did you ever go a - begging afore you came here ? "
172727	172751	172714	172714	I	0	" You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar . I am no beggar ; any more than yourself or your young ladies . "
172758	172777	172755	172755	she	233	" I dunnut understand that : you 've like no house , nor no brass , I guess ? "
172778	172804	172714	172714	I	0	" The want of house or brass by which I suppose you mean money does not make a beggar in your sense of the word . "
172805	172812	172813	172813	she	233	" Are you book - learned ? "
172817	172822	172755	172755	she	233	" Yes , very . "
172823	172835	172714	172714	I	0	" But you 've never been to a boarding - school ? "
172836	172847	172848	172848	She	233	" I was at a boarding - school eight years . "
172854	172865	172848	172848	She	233	" Whatever can not ye keep yourself for , then ? "
172866	172892	172893	172893	I	0	" I have kept myself ; and , I trust , shall keep myself again . What are you going to do with these gooseberries ? "
172906	172913	172897	172897	she	233	" Mak ' 'em into pies . "
172914	172925	172848	172848	She	233	" Give them to me and I 'll pick them . "
172926	172937	172955	172955	she	233	" Nay ; I dunnut want ye to do nought . "
172938	172950	172897	172897	she	233	" But I must do something . Let me have them . "
172968	172971	172973	172973	she	233	" lest , "
172976	172982	172973	172973	she	233	" I should mucky it . "
172983	172999	173000	173000	she	233	" Ye've not been used to sarvant 's wark , I see by your hands , "
173003	173010	173000	173000	she	233	" Happen ye've been a dressmaker ? "
173011	173049	172973	172973	she	233	" No , you are wrong . And now , never mind what I have been : do n't trouble your head further about me ; but tell me the name of the house where we are . "
173050	173064	172973	172973	she	233	" Some calls it Marsh End , and some calls it Moor House . "
173065	173078	173000	173000	she	233	" And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John ? "
173079	173110	172973	172973	she	233	" Nay ; he does n't live here : he is only staying a while . When he is at home , he is in his own parish at Morton . "
173111	173119	172973	172973	she	233	" That village a few miles off ? "
173122	173123	172973	172973	she	233	" "
173129	173130	173131	173131	He	3359	" "
173136	173158	173133	173134	a parson	5186	" I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage , when I had asked to see the clergyman . "
173169	173170	173164	173165	his father	5218	" "
173193	173194	173173	173175	old Mr. Rivers	177	" "

173334	173344	173323	173323	you	1052	" She again regarded me with a surprised stare . "
173348	173352	173323	173323	you	1052	" she said , "
173377	173378	173372	173372	you	1052	" "
173382	173389	173390	173390	you	1052	" I continued , rather severely , "
173412	173413	173390	173390	you	1052	" "
173462	173472	173455	173455	I	0	" I maintained a grave silence for some minutes . "
173481	173486	173473	173473	You	1052	" she again remarked . "
173495	173499	173488	173488	I	0	" I said ; "

173644	173709	173710	173711	the childer	3386	" She put her floury and horny hand into mine ; another and heartier smile illumined her rough face , and from that moment we were friends . Hannah was evidently fond of talking . While I picked the fruit , and she made the paste for the pies , she proceeded to give me sundry details about her deceased master and mistress , and "
173713	173770	173710	173711	the childer	3386	" as she called the young people . Old Mr. Rivers , she said , was a plain man enough , but a gentleman , and of as ancient a family as could be found . Marsh End had belonged to the Rivers ever since it was a house : and it was , she affirmed , "
173850	173856	173857	173859	the owd maister	3396	" Still , she allowed , "
173888	173907	173956	173956	their	3399	" The mistress was different . She was a great reader , and studied a deal ; and the "
173909	173950	173956	173956	their	3399	" had taken after her . There was nothing like them in these parts , nor ever had been ; they had liked learning , all three , almost from the time they could speak ; and they had always been "
173959	174125	173956	173956	their	3399	" Mr. St. John , when he grew up , would go to college and be a parson ; and the girls , as soon as they left school , would seek places as governesses : for they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt ; and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes , they must provide for themselves . They had lived very little at home for a long while , and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father 's death ; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton , and all these moors and hills about . They had been in London , and many other grand towns ; but they always said there was no place like home ; and then they were so agreeable with each other - never fell out nor "
174128	174163	173956	173956	their	3399	" She did not know where there was such a family for being united . Having finished my task of gooseberry picking , I asked where the two ladies and their brother were now . "
174186	174263	174264	174264	You	3401	" They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them : they entered by the kitchen door . Mr. St. John , when he saw me , merely bowed and passed through ; the two ladies stopped : Mary , in a few words , kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down ; Diana took my hand : she shook her head at me . "
174274	174278	174264	174264	You	3401	" she said . "
174296	174413	174289	174290	Poor child	3402	" Diana had a voice toned , to my ear , like the cooing of a dove . She possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter . Her whole face seemed to me full of charm . Mary 's countenance was equally intelligent - her features equally pretty ; but her expression was more reserved , and her manners , though gentle , more distant . Diana looked and spoke with a certain authority : she had a will , evidently . It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers , and to bend , where my conscience and self - respect permitted , to an active will . "
174421	174425	174289	174290	Poor child	3402	" she continued . "
174467	174468	174469	174469	I	0	" "
174475	174476	174469	174469	I	0	" "
174491	174492	174482	174482	Hannah	233	" "
174503	174507	174482	174482	Hannah	233	" interposed Mary . "
174512	174517	174482	174482	Hannah	233	" added her sister . "
174525	174544	174482	174482	Hannah	233	" And still holding my hand she made me rise , and led me into the inner room . "
174548	174558	174482	174482	Hannah	233	" she said , placing me on the sofa , "
174607	175077	175092	175092	Hannah	233	" She closed the door , leaving me solus with Mr. St. John , who sat opposite , a book or newspaper in his hand . I examined first , the parlour , and then its occupant . The parlour was rather a small room , very plainly furnished , yet comfortable , because clean and neat . The old - fashioned chairs were very bright , and the walnut - wood table was like a looking - glass . A few strange , antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated the stained walls ; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china . There was no superfluous ornament in the room - not one modern piece of furniture , save a brace of workboxes and a lady 's desk in rosewood , which stood on a side - table : everything - including the carpet and curtains - looked at once well worn and well saved . Mr. St. John - sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls , keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused , and his lips mutely sealed - was easy enough to examine . Had he been a statue instead of a man , he could not have been easier . He was young - perhaps from twenty - eight to thirty - tall , slender ; his face riveted the eye ; it was like a Greek face , very pure in outline : quite a straight , classic nose ; quite an Athenian mouth and chin . It is seldom , indeed , an English face comes so near the antique models as did his . He might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments , his own being so harmonious . His eyes were large and blue , with brown lashes ; his high forehead , colourless as ivory , was partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair . This is a gentle delineation , is it not , reader ? Yet he whom it describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle , a yielding , an impressible , or even of a placid nature . Quiescent as he now sat , there was something about his nostril , his mouth , his brow , which , to my perceptions , indicated elements within either restless , or hard , or eager . He did not speak to me one word , nor even direct to me one glance , till his sisters returned . Diana , as she passed in and out , in the course of preparing tea , brought me a little cake , baked on the top of the oven . "
175082	175086	175092	175092	Hannah	233	" she said : "
175104	175183	175092	175092	Hannah	233	" I did not refuse it , for my appetite was awakened and keen . Mr. Rivers now closed his book , approached the table , and , as he took a seat , fixed his blue pictorial - looking eyes full on me . There was an unceremonious directness , a searching , decided steadfastness in his gaze now , which told that intention , and not diffidence , had hitherto kept it averted from the stranger . "
175189	175193	175092	175092	Hannah	233	" he said . "
175199	175227	175197	175197	sir	4374	" It is my way - it always was my way , by instinct - ever to meet the brief with brevity , the direct with plainness . "
175274	175275	175276	175276	I	0	" "
175289	175300	175287	175287	sir	4374	" was my very clumsily - contrived , unpolished answer . "
175303	175308	175310	175310	you	3413	" he said coolly : "
175335	175336	175339	175339	I	0	" "
175360	175457	175459	175459	you	4374	" The three looked at me , but not distrustfully ; I felt there was no suspicion in their glances : there was more of curiosity . I speak particularly of the young ladies . St. John 's eyes , though clear enough in a literal sense , in a figurative one were difficult to fathom . He seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people 's thoughts , than as agents to reveal his own : the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage . "
175464	175468	175459	175459	you	4374	" he asked , "
175478	175479	175480	175480	I	0	" "
175507	175508	175514	175514	your	0	" "
175517	175551	175514	175514	your	0	" Here I saw his glance directed to my hands , which were folded on the table before me . I wondered what he sought there : his words soon explained the quest . "
175563	175567	175560	175561	a spinster	3422	" Diana laughed . "
175584	175588	175581	175582	St. John	177	" said she . "
175602	175675	175581	175582	St. John	177	" I felt a burning glow mount to my face ; for bitter and agitating recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage . They all saw the embarrassment and the emotion . Diana and Mary relieved me by turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage ; but the colder and sterner brother continued to gaze , till the trouble he had excited forced out tears as well as colour . "
175682	175687	175581	175582	St. John	177	" he now asked . "
175696	175722	175688	175688	You	177	" murmured Mary in a low voice ; but he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and piercing look . "
175743	175748	175740	175740	my	0	" I replied concisely . "
175776	175780	175769	175770	St. John	177	" remarked Diana . "
175798	175802	175809	175809	you	177	" he said . "
175812	175813	175809	175809	you	177	" "
175863	175864	175865	175865	I	0	" "
175914	175959	175960	175961	Mr. Rivers	177	" I had now swallowed my tea . I was mightily refreshed by the beverage ; as much so as a giant with wine : it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves , and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily . "
175963	175987	175960	175961	Mr. Rivers	177	" I said , turning to him , and looking at him , as he looked at me , openly and without diffidence , "
176087	176172	176046	176046	I	0	" I am an orphan , the daughter of a clergyman . My parents died before I could know them . I was brought up a dependant ; educated in a charitable institution . I will even tell you the name of the establishment , where I passed six years as a pupil , and two as a teacher - Lowood Orphan Asylum , -shire : you will have heard of it , Mr. Rivers ? - the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer . "
176173	176188	176046	176046	I	0	" I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst , and I have seen the school . "
176189	176491	176510	176510	I	0	" I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess . I obtained a good situation , and was happy . This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came here . The reason of my departure I can not and ought not to explain : it would be useless , dangerous , and would sound incredible . No blame attached to me : I am as free from culpability as any one of you three . Miserable I am , and must be for a time ; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature . I observed but two points in planning my departure - speed , secrecy : to secure these , I had to leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel ; which , in my hurry and trouble of mind , I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to Whitcross . To this neighbourhood , then , I came , quite destitute . I slept two nights in the open air , and wandered about two days without crossing a threshold : but twice in that space of time did I taste food ; and it was when brought by hunger , exhaustion , and despair almost to the last gasp , that you , Mr. Rivers , forbade me to perish of want at your door , and took me under the shelter of your roof . I know all your sisters have done for me since - for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor - and I owe to their spontaneous , genuine , genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity . "
176492	176505	176507	176507	Diana	400	" Do n't make her talk any more now , St. John , "
176535	176568	176532	176533	Miss Elliott	412	" I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the alias : I had forgotten my new name . Mr. Rivers , whom nothing seemed to escape , noticed it at once . "
176577	176581	176582	176582	I	0	" he observed . "
176624	176625	176626	176626	Your	0	" "

176685	176707	176708	176708	You	0	" But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever . "
176775	176776	176777	176777	I	0	" "
176840	176841	176829	176829	I	0	" "
176848	176860	176843	176843	you	0	" said Diana , putting her white hand on my head . "
176864	176880	176861	176861	You	0	" repeated Mary , in the tone of undemonstrative sincerity which seemed natural to her . "
176894	176900	176902	176902	they	3437	" said Mr. St. John , "
177001	177002	177003	177003	She	3443	" "
177019	177025	177008	177008	she	3443	" answered Diana for me ; "
177053	177054	177055	177055	I	0	" "
177087	177091	177081	177081	I	0	" I answered . "
177094	177103	177081	177081	I	0	" said Mr. St. John , quite coolly . "
177123	178101	177110	177110	I	0	" He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea . I soon withdrew , for I had talked as much , and sat up as long , as my present strength would permit . CHAPTER XXX The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House , the better I liked them . In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day , and walk out sometimes . I could join with Diana and Mary in all their occupations ; converse with them as much as they wished , and aid them when and where they would allow me . There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse , of a kind now tasted by me for the first time - the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes , sentiments , and principles . I liked to read what they liked to read : what they enjoyed , delighted me ; what they approved , I reverenced . They loved their sequestered home . I , too , in the grey , small , antique structure , with its low roof , its latticed casements , its mouldering walls , its avenue of aged firs - all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds ; its garden , dark with yew and holly - and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom - found a charm both potent and permanent . They clung to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling - to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle - path leading from their gate descended , and which wound between fern - banks first , and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture - fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath , or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep , with their little mossy - faced lambs:- they clung to this scene , I say , with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment . I could comprehend the feeling , and share both its strength and truth . I saw the fascination of the locality . I felt the consecration of its loneliness : my eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep - on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss , by heath - bell , by flower - sprinkled turf , by brilliant bracken , and mellow granite crag . These details were just to me what they were to them - so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure . The strong blast and the soft breeze ; the rough and the halcyon day ; the hours of sunrise and sunset ; the moonlight and the clouded night , developed for me , in these regions , the same attraction as for them - wound round my faculties the same spell that entranced theirs . Indoors we agreed equally well . They were both more accomplished and better read than I was ; but with eagerness I followed in the path of knowledge they had trodden before me . I devoured the books they lent me : then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I had perused during the day . Thought fitted thought ; opinion met opinion : we coincided , in short , perfectly . If in our trio there was a superior and a leader , it was Diana . Physically , she far excelled me : she was handsome ; she was vigorous . In her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow , such as excited my wonder , while it baffled my comprehension . I could talk a while when the evening commenced , but the first gush of vivacity and fluency gone , I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana 's feet , to rest my head on her knee , and listen alternately to her and Mary , while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched . Diana offered to teach me German . I liked to learn of her : I saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her ; that of scholar pleased and suited me no less . Our natures dovetailed : mutual affection - of the strongest kind - was the result . They discovered I could draw : their pencils and colour - boxes were immediately at my service . My skill , greater in this one point than theirs , surprised and charmed them . Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together : then she would take lessons ; and a docile , intelligent , assiduous pupil she made . Thus occupied , and mutually entertained , days passed like hours , and weeks like days . As to Mr. St John , the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him . One reason of the distance yet observed between us was , that he was comparatively seldom at home : a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish . No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions : rain or fair , he would , when his hours of morning study were over , take his hat , and , followed by his father 's old pointer , Carlo , go out on his mission of love or duty - I scarcely know in which light he regarded it . Sometimes , when the day was very unfavourable , his sisters would expostulate . He would then say , with a peculiar smile , more solemn than cheerful - "
178137	178975	178976	178976	You	3450	" Diana and Mary 's general answer to this question was a sigh , and some minutes of apparently mournful meditation . But besides his frequent absences , there was another barrier to friendship with him : he seemed of a reserved , an abstracted , and even of a brooding nature . Zealous in his ministerial labours , blameless in his life and habits , he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity , that inward content , which should be the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist . Often , of an evening , when he sat at the window , his desk and papers before him , he would cease reading or writing , rest his chin on his hand , and deliver himself up to I know not what course of thought ; but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye . I think , moreover , that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it was to his sisters . He expressed once , and but once in my hearing , a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills , and an inborn affection for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home ; but there was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was manifested ; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their soothing silence - never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield . Incommunicative as he was , some time elapsed before I had an opportunity of gauging his mind . I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton . I wish I could describe that sermon : but it is past my power . I can not even render faithfully the effect it produced on me . It began calm - and indeed , as far as delivery and pitch of voice went , it was calm to the end : an earnestly felt , yet strictly restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents , and prompted the nervous language . This grew to force - compressed , condensed , controlled . The heart was thrilled , the mind astonished , by the power of the preacher : neither were softened . Throughout there was a strange bitterness ; an absence of consolatory gentleness ; stern allusions to Calvinistic doctrines - election , predestination , reprobation - were frequent ; and each reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom . When he had done , instead of feeling better , calmer , more enlightened by his discourse , I experienced an inexpressible sadness ; for it seemed to me - I know not whether equally so to others - that the eloquence to which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of disappointment - where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and disquieting aspirations . I was sure St. John Rivers - pure - lived , conscientious , zealous as he was - had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all understanding : he had no more found it , I thought , than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium - regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring , but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly . Meantime a month was gone . Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House , and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them , as governesses in a large , fashionable , south - of - England city , where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they were regarded only as humble dependants , and who neither knew nor sought out their innate excellences , and appreciated only their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste of their waiting - woman . Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me ; yet it became urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind . One morning , being left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour , I ventured to approach the window - recess - which his table , chair , and desk consecrated as a kind of study - and I was going to speak , though not very well knowing in what words to frame my inquiry - for it is at all times difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his - when he saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue . Looking up as I drew near - "
178985	178989	178976	178976	You	3450	" he said . "
179010	179011	179012	179012	I	0	" "
179074	179075	179051	179051	I	0	" "
179085	179089	179094	179094	they	3437	" I said . "
179120	179181	179106	179106	Hannah	233	" I waited a few moments , expecting he would go on with the subject first broached : but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection : his look denoted abstraction from me and my business . I was obliged to recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to me . "
179208	179209	179194	179194	I	0	" "
179232	179283	179284	179284	You	0	" He again paused : there seemed a reluctance to continue . I grew impatient : a restless movement or two , and an eager and exacting glance fastened on his face , conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words could have done , and with less trouble . "
179293	179297	179299	179299	me	0	" he said : "
179520	179554	179493	179497	the Head of that church	3467	" St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons , with a quiet , deep voice ; with an unflushed cheek , and a coruscating radiance of glance . He resumed - "
179697	179698	179695	179695	Himself	3481	" "
179701	179710	179695	179695	Himself	3481	" I said , as he again paused - "
179713	179758	179759	179759	I	0	" He looked at me before he proceeded : indeed , he seemed leisurely to read my face , as if its features and lines were characters on a page . The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations . "
179770	179774	179766	179766	I	0	" said he , "
179831	179832	179851	179851	you	3482	" "
179836	179846	179847	179847	I	0	" I urged , when he halted once more . "
180109	180232	180104	180104	you	0	" He put the question rather hurriedly ; he seemed half to expect an indignant , or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer : not knowing all my thoughts and feelings , though guessing some , he could not tell in what light the lot would appear to me . In truth it was humble - but then it was sheltered , and I wanted a safe asylum : it was plodding - but then , compared with that of a governess in a rich house , it was independent ; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron : it was not ignoble - not unworthy - not mentally degrading , I made my decision . "
180252	180253	180244	180244	I	0	" "
180259	180263	180255	180255	you	177	" he said . "

180359	180381	180356	180356	I	0	" He now smiled : and not a bitter or a sad smile , but one well pleased and deeply gratified . "
180393	180394	180385	180385	you	177	" "

180426	180449	180395	180395	I	0	" He rose and walked through the room . Standing still , he again looked at me . He shook his head . "
180459	180463	180456	180457	Mr. Rivers	177	" I asked . "
180476	180477	180456	180457	Mr. Rivers	177	" "
180488	180489	180482	180482	your	177	" "

180521	180527	180516	180516	I	0	" He started at the word "
180530	180534	180516	180516	I	0	" He repeated , "
180561	180562	180556	180556	you	177	" "
180569	180570	180567	180567	myself	0	" "
180582	180586	180579	180579	you	177	" He paused . "
180589	180590	180591	180591	I	0	" "
180667	180674	180662	180662	I	0	" he added , with emphasis , "
180769	180889	180890	180890	He	0	" He left the room . In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in the whole previous month : yet still he puzzled me . Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for leaving their brother and their home . They both tried to appear as usual ; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed . Diana intimated that this would be a different parting from any they had ever yet known . It would probably , as far as St. John was concerned , be a parting for years : it might be a parting for life . "
180901	180905	180890	180890	He	0	" she said : "
180994	181013	181014	181014	We	3524	" And the tears gushed to her fine eyes . Mary bent her head low over her work . "
181029	181056	181014	181014	We	3524	" she murmured , At that moment a little accident supervened , which seemed decreed by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage , that "
181062	181094	181014	181014	We	3524	" and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip between the cup and the lip . St. John passed the window reading a letter . He entered . "
181101	181127	181097	181097	John	177	" said he . Both the sisters seemed struck : not shocked or appalled ; the tidings appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting . "
181130	181134	181014	181014	We	3524	" repeated Diana . "
181137	181149	181014	181014	We	3524	" She riveted a searching gaze on her brother 's face . "
181154	181163	181167	181167	Die	419	" she demanded , in a low voice . "
181169	181180	181167	181167	Die	419	" he replied , maintaining a marble immobility of feature . "
181190	181242	181167	181167	Die	419	" He threw the letter into her lap . She glanced over it , and handed it to Mary . Mary perused it in silence , and returned it to her brother . All three looked at each other , and all three smiled - a dreary , pensive smile enough . "
181250	181256	181167	181167	Die	419	" said Diana at last . "
181272	181276	181167	181167	Die	419	" remarked Mary . "
181293	181298	181167	181167	Die	419	" said Mr. Rivers , "
181309	181339	181340	181340	Jane	406	" He folded the letter , locked it in his desk , and again went out . For some minutes no one spoke . Diana then turned to me . "
181351	181355	181342	181342	you	406	" she said , "
181616	182604	181595	181596	St. John	177	" This explanation given , the subject was dropped , and no further reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters . The next day I left Marsh End for Morton . The day after , Diana and Mary quitted it for distant B- . In a week , Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage : and so the old grange was abandoned . CHAPTER XXXI My home , then , when I at last find a home , - is a cottage ; a little room with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor , containing four painted chairs and a table , a clock , a cupboard , with two or three plates and dishes , and a set of tea - things in delf . Above , a chamber of the same dimensions as the kitchen , with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers ; small , yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe : though the kindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that , by a modest stock of such things as are necessary . It is evening . I have dismissed , with the fee of an orange , the little orphan who serves me as a handmaid . I am sitting alone on the hearth . This morning , the village school opened . I had twenty scholars . But three of the number can read : none write or cipher . Several knit , and a few sew a little . They speak with the broadest accent of the district . At present , they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other 's language . Some of them are unmannered , rough , intractable , as well as ignorant ; but others are docile , have a wish to learn , and evince a disposition that pleases me . I must not forget that these coarsely - clad little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest genealogy ; and that the germs of native excellence , refinement , intelligence , kind feeling , are as likely to exist in their hearts as in those of the best - born . My duty will be to develop these germs : surely I shall find some happiness in discharging that office . Much enjoyment I do not expect in the life opening before me : yet it will , doubtless , if I regulate my mind , and exert my powers as I ought , yield me enough to live on from day to day . Was I very gleeful , settled , content , during the hours I passed in yonder bare , humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon ? Not to deceive myself , I must reply - No : I felt desolate to a degree . I felt - yes , idiot that I am - I felt degraded . I doubted I had taken a step which sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence . I was weakly dismayed at the ignorance , the poverty , the coarseness of all I heard and saw round me . But let me not hate and despise myself too much for these feelings ; I know them to be wrong - that is a great step gained ; I shall strive to overcome them . To - morrow , I trust , I shall get the better of them partially ; and in a few weeks , perhaps , they will be quite subdued . In a few months , it is possible , the happiness of seeing progress , and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute gratification for disgust . Meantime , let me ask myself one question - Which is better ? - To have surrendered to temptation ; listened to passion ; made no painful effort - no struggle ; - but to have sunk down in the silken snare ; fallen asleep on the flowers covering it ; wakened in a southern clime , amongst the luxuries of a pleasure villa : to have been now living in France , Mr. Rochester 's mistress ; delirious with his love half my time - for he would - oh , yes , he would have loved me well for a while . He DID love me - no one will ever love me so again . I shall never more know the sweet homage given to beauty , youth , and grace - for never to any one else shall I seem to possess these charms . He was fond and proud of me - it is what no man besides will ever be . - But where am I wandering , and what am I saying , and above all , feeling ? Whether is it better , I ask , to be a slave in a fool 's paradise at Marseilles - fevered with delusive bliss one hour - suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the next - or to be a village - schoolmistress , free and honest , in a breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of England ? Yes ; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law , and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment . God directed me to a correct choice : I thank His providence for the guidance ! Having brought my eventide musings to this point , I rose , went to my door , and looked at the sunset of the harvest - day , and at the quiet fields before my cottage , which , with the school , was distant half a mile from the village . The birds were singing their last strains - "
182615	182874	181595	181596	St. John	177	" While I looked , I thought myself happy , and was surprised to find myself ere long weeping - and why ? For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my master : for him I was no more to see ; for the desperate grief and fatal fury - consequences of my departure - which might now , perhaps , be dragging him from the path of right , too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither . At this thought , I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton - I say LONELY , for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage , half - hid in trees , and , quite at the extremity , the roof of Vale Hall , where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived . I hid my eyes , and leant my head against the stone frame of my door ; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up . A dog - old Carlo , Mr. Rivers ' pointer , as I saw in a moment - was pushing the gate with his nose , and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms ; his brow knit , his gaze , grave almost to displeasure , fixed on me . I asked him to come in . "
182910	182950	182896	182896	I	0	" I approached to take it : a welcome gift it was . He examined my face , I thought , with austerity , as I came near : the traces of tears were doubtless very visible upon it . "
182964	182968	182952	182952	you	0	" he asked . "
182991	182992	182977	182977	I	0	" "
183020	183024	183025	183025	My	0	" I interrupted - "
183132	183133	183127	183127	I	0	" "
183152	183153	183154	183154	I	0	" "

183273	183281	183268	183268	I	0	" I answered . St. John continued - "
183422	183648	183651	183651	I	0	" A year ago I was myself intensely miserable , because I thought I had made a mistake in entering the ministry : its uniform duties wearied me to death . I burnt for the more active life of the world - for the more exciting toils of a literary career - for the destiny of an artist , author , orator ; anything rather than that of a priest : yes , the heart of a politician , of a soldier , of a votary of glory , a lover of renown , a luster after power , beat under my curate 's surplice . I considered ; my life was so wretched , it must be changed , or I must die . After a season of darkness and struggling , light broke and relief fell : my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds - my powers heard a call from heaven to rise , gather their full strength , spread their wings , and mount beyond ken . God had an errand for me ; to bear which afar , to deliver it well , skill and strength , courage and eloquence , the best qualifications of soldier , statesman , and orator , were all needed : for these all centre in the good missionary . "
183768	183872	183761	183761	I	0	" He said this , in his peculiar , subdued , yet emphatic voice ; looking , when he had ceased speaking , not at me , but at the setting sun , at which I looked too . Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the field to the wicket . We had heard no step on that grass - grown track ; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene ; we might well then start when a gay voice , sweet as a silver bell , exclaimed - "
183927	184407	183921	183921	your	177	" It was true . Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical accents , as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head , he stood yet , at the close of the sentence , in the same attitude in which the speaker had surprised him - his arm resting on the gate , his face directed towards the west . He turned at last , with measured deliberation . A vision , as it seemed to me , had risen at his side . There appeared , within three feet of him , a form clad in pure white - a youthful , graceful form : full , yet fine in contour ; and when , after bending to caress Carlo , it lifted up its head , and threw back a long veil , there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty . Perfect beauty is a strong expression ; but I do not retrace or qualify it : as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded ; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened , justified , in this instance , the term . No charm was wanting , no defect was perceptible ; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments ; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures , large , and dark , and full ; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination ; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness ; the white smooth forehead , which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray ; the cheek oval , fresh , and smooth ; the lips , fresh too , ruddy , healthy , sweetly formed ; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw ; the small dimpled chin ; the ornament of rich , plenteous tresses - all advantages , in short , which , combined , realise the ideal of beauty , were fully hers . I wondered , as I looked at this fair creature : I admired her with my whole heart . Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood ; and , forgetting her usual stinted step - mother dole of gifts , had endowed this , her darling , with a grand - dame 's bounty . What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel ? I naturally asked myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her ; and , as naturally , I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance . He had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri , and was looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket . "
184421	184439	184465	184465	Papa	423	" he said , as he crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot . "
184448	184461	184465	184465	Papa	423	" she mentioned the name of a large town some twenty miles distant "
184505	184510	184503	184503	she	3567	" pointing to me . "
184514	184519	184503	184503	she	3567	" said St. John . "
184528	184552	184521	184521	you	3564	" she asked of me , with a direct and naive simplicity of tone and manner , pleasing , if child - like . "
184566	184567	184558	184558	I	0	" "
184579	184580	184569	184569	you	3564	" "

184591	184592	184586	184586	you	3564	" "
184596	184597	184586	184586	you	3564	" "
184604	184605	184599	184599	I	0	" "
184611	184612	184599	184599	I	0	" "
184627	184628	184629	184629	You	3564	" "
184639	184686	184633	184633	She	115	" This then , I thought , is Miss Oliver , the heiress ; favoured , it seems , in the gifts of fortune , as well as in those of nature ! What happy combination of the planets presided over her birth , I wonder ? "
184698	184702	184687	184687	I	0	" she added . "
184788	184909	184774	184774	they	3573	" It seemed to me that Mr. St. John 's under lip protruded , and his upper lip curled a moment . His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed , and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square , as the laughing girl gave him this information . He lifted his gaze , too , from the daisies , and turned it on her . An unsmiling , a searching , a meaning gaze it was . She answered it with a second laugh , and laughter well became her youth , her roses , her dimples , her bright eyes . As he stood , mute and grave , she again fell to caressing Carlo . "
184915	184919	184911	184911	Carlo	414	" said she . "
184942	185074	185075	185075	Papa	423	" As she patted the dog 's head , bending with native grace before his young and austere master , I saw a glow rise to that master 's face . I saw his solemn eye melt with sudden fire , and flicker with resistless emotion . Flushed and kindled thus , he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman . His chest heaved once , as if his large heart , weary of despotic constriction , had expanded , despite the will , and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty . But he curbed it , I think , as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed . He responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him . "
185085	185093	185077	185077	you	423	" continued Miss Oliver , looking up . "
185123	185124	185115	185115	you	423	" "
185137	185142	185134	185135	Mr. Oliver	399	" answered St. John . "
185199	185215	185216	185216	I	0	" She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of her own . "
185219	185235	185216	185216	I	0	" she exclaimed , shaking her beautiful curled head , as if shocked at herself . "
185299	185300	185297	185297	papa	4423	" "
185314	185336	185306	185307	Miss Rosamond	424	" Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton : himself only knew the effort it cost him thus to refuse . "
185367	185379	185297	185297	papa	4423	" She held out her hand . He just touched it . "
185383	185406	185297	185297	papa	4423	" he repeated , in a voice low and hollow as an echo . She turned , but in a moment returned . "
185411	185430	185408	185408	you	4423	" she asked . Well might she put the question : his face was blanched as her gown . "
185434	185511	185408	185408	you	4423	" he enunciated ; and , with a bow , he left the gate . She went one way ; he another . She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped fairy - like down the field ; he , as he strode firmly across , never turned at all . This spectacle of another 's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from exclusive meditation on my own . Diana Rivers had designated her brother "
185516	186000	185408	185408	you	4423	" She had not exaggerated . CHAPTER XXXII I continued the labours of the village - school as actively and faithfully as I could . It was truly hard work at first . Some time elapsed before , with all my efforts , I could comprehend my scholars and their nature . Wholly untaught , with faculties quite torpid , they seemed to me hopelessly dull ; and , at first sight , all dull alike : but I soon found I was mistaken . There was a difference amongst them as amongst the educated ; and when I got to know them , and they me , this difference rapidly developed itself . Their amazement at me , my language , my rules , and ways , once subsided , I found some of these heavy - looking , gaping rustics wake up into sharp - witted girls enough . Many showed themselves obliging , and amiable too ; and I discovered amongst them not a few examples of natural politeness , and innate self - respect , as well as of excellent capacity , that won both my goodwill and my admiration . These soon took a pleasure in doing their work well , in keeping their persons neat , in learning their tasks regularly , in acquiring quiet and orderly manners . The rapidity of their progress , in some instances , was even surprising ; and an honest and happy pride I took in it : besides , I began personally to like some of the best girls ; and they liked me . I had amongst my scholars several farmers ' daughters : young women grown , almost . These could already read , write , and sew ; and to them I taught the elements of grammar , geography , history , and the finer kinds of needlework . I found estimable characters amongst them - characters desirous of information and disposed for improvement - with whom I passed many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes . Their parents then the farmer and his wife loaded me with attentions . There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness , and in repaying it by a consideration - a scrupulous regard to their feelings - to which they were not , perhaps , at all times accustomed , and which both charmed and benefited them ; because , while it elevated them in their own eyes , it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received . I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood . Whenever I went out , I heard on all sides cordial salutations , and was welcomed with friendly smiles . To live amidst general regard , though it be but the regard of working people , is like ' sitting in sunshine , calm and sweet ; "
186566	186631	186544	186544	He	3593	" I love you , and I know you prefer me . It is not despair of success that keeps me dumb . If I offered my heart , I believe you would accept it . But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar : the fire is arranged round it . It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed . "
187045	187069	187042	187042	she	417	" not one - tenth so handsome , though I was a nice neat little soul enough , but he was an angel . "
187230	187280	187217	187217	She	417	" Had I done these pictures ? Did I know French and German ? What a love - what a miracle I was ! I drew better than her master in the first school in S- . Would I sketch a portrait of her , to show to papa ? "
187281	187285	187286	187286	I	0	" With pleasure , "
187606	187609	187611	187611	Rosamond	425	" Indeed , "
187629	188002	187614	187614	she	425	" I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the land . Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers - of the Rivers family - with great respect . He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood ; that the ancestors of the house were wealthy ; that all Morton had once belonged to them ; that even now he considered the representative of that house might , if he liked , make an alliance with the best . He accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going out as a missionary ; it was quite throwing a valuable life away . It appeared , then , that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of Rosamond 's union with St. John . Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young clergyman 's good birth , old name , and sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune . It was the 5th of November , and a holiday . My little servant , after helping me to clean my house , was gone , well satisfied with the fee of a penny for her aid . All about me was spotless and bright - scoured floor , polished grate , and well - rubbed chairs . I had also made myself neat , and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would . The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour ; then I got my palette and pencils , and fell to the more soothing , because easier occupation , of completing Rosamond Oliver 's miniature . The head was finished already : there was but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off ; a touch of carmine , too , to add to the ripe lips - a soft curl here and there to the tresses - a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid . I was absorbed in the execution of these nice details , when , after one rapid tap , my door unclosed , admitting St. John Rivers . "
188015	188019	188003	188003	I	0	" he said . "
188070	188260	188060	188060	I	0	" and he laid on the table a new publication - a poem : one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days - the golden age of modern literature . Alas ! the readers of our era are less favoured . But courage ! I will not pause either to accuse or repine . I know poetry is not dead , nor genius lost ; nor has Mammon gained power over either , to bind or slay : they will both assert their existence , their presence , their liberty and strength again one day . Powerful angels , safe in heaven ! they smile when sordid souls triumph , and feeble ones weep over their destruction . Poetry destroyed ? Genius banished ? No ! Mediocrity , no : do not let envy prompt you to the thought . No ; they not only live , but reign and redeem : and without their divine influence spread everywhere , you would be in hell - the hell of your own meanness . While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "
188262	188264	188265	188265	Marmion	427	" for "
188266	188351	188354	188354	his	3631	" it was , St. John stooped to examine my drawing . His tall figure sprang erect again with a start : he said nothing . I looked up at him : he shunned my eye . I knew his thoughts well , and could read his heart plainly ; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he : I had then temporarily the advantage of him , and I conceived an inclination to do him some good , if I could . "
188361	188365	188366	188366	he	3631	" thought I , "
188417	188422	188411	188411	I	0	" I said first , "
188430	188446	188427	188428	Mr. Rivers	177	" But he answered , as he always did , that he could not stay . "
188450	188524	188427	188428	Mr. Rivers	177	" I responded , mentally , ' stand if you like ; but you shall not go just yet , I am determined : solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me . I 'll try if I can not discover the secret spring of your confidence , and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy . "
188525	188531	188532	188532	I	0	" Is this portrait like ? "
188536	188549	188532	188532	I	0	" Like ! Like whom ? I did not observe it closely . "
188550	188557	188558	188558	He	177	" You did , Mr. Rivers . "
188574	188582	188583	188583	I	0	" Oh , that is nothing yet , "
188587	188612	188613	188613	I	0	" I do n't mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part ; I 'm prepared to go to considerable lengths . "
188616	188636	188613	188613	I	0	" You observed it closely and distinctly ; but I have no objection to your looking at it again , "
188647	188654	188655	188655	he	177	" A well - executed picture , "
188658	188671	188655	188655	he	177	" very soft , clear colouring ; very graceful and correct drawing . "
188672	188693	188698	188698	he	177	" Yes , yes ; I know all that . But what of the resemblance ? Who is it like ? "
188701	188708	188698	188698	he	177	" Miss Oliver , I presume . "
188709	188773	188774	188774	He	177	" Of course . And now , sir , to reward you for the accurate guess , I will promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very picture , provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you . I do n't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would deem worthless . "
188801	188806	188807	188807	he	177	" It is like ! "
188810	188830	188807	188807	he	177	" the eye is well managed : the colour , light , expression , are perfect . It smiles ! "
188831	188893	188894	188894	He	177	" Would it comfort , or would it wound you to have a similar painting ? Tell me that . When you are at Madagascar , or at the Cape , or in India , would it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession ? or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress ? "
188916	188938	188910	188910	he	177	" That I should like to have it is certain : whether it would be judicious or wise is another question . "
189041	189068	189037	189037	I	0	" As far as I can see , it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to take to yourself the original at once . "
189187	189189	189175	189179	The sternest - seeming stoic	3636	" burst "
189197	189201	189175	189179	The sternest - seeming stoic	3636	" the silent sea "
189216	189225	189227	189227	I	0	" She likes you , I am sure , "
189236	189272	189227	189227	I	0	" and her father respects you . Moreover , she is a sweet girl - rather thoughtless ; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her . You ought to marry her . "
189273	189279	189280	189280	he	177	" DOES she like me ? "
189283	189314	189280	189280	he	177	" Certainly ; better than she likes any one else . She talks of you continually : there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so often . "
189315	189324	189325	189325	he	177	" It is very pleasant to hear this , "
189328	189340	189342	189342	he	177	" very : go on for another quarter of an hour . "
189359	189369	189370	189370	I	0	" But where is the use of going on , "
189373	189395	189370	189370	I	0	" when you are probably preparing some iron blow of contradiction , or forging a fresh chain to fetter your heart ? "
189396	189581	189582	189582	I	0	" Do n't imagine such hard things . Fancy me yielding and melting , as I am doing : human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and with such labour prepared - so assiduously sown with the seeds of good intentions , of self - denying plans . And now it is deluged with a nectarous flood - the young germs swamped - delicious poison cankering them : now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing - room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver 's feet : she is talking to me with her sweet voice - gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has copied so well - smiling at me with these coral lips . She is mine - I am hers - this present life and passing world suffice to me . Hush ! say nothing - my heart is full of delight - my senses are entranced - let the time I marked pass in peace . "
189626	189629	189631	189631	he	3637	" Now , "
189633	189706	189631	189631	he	3637	" that little space was given to delirium and delusion . I rested my temples on the breast of temptation , and put my neck voluntarily under her yoke of flowers . I tasted her cup . The pillow was burning : there is an asp in the garland : the wine has a bitter taste : her promises are hollow - her offers false : I see and know all this . "
189714	189719	189721	189721	he	3637	" It is strange , "
189723	189817	189721	189721	he	3637	" that while I love Rosamond Oliver so wildly - with all the intensity , indeed , of a first passion , the object of which is exquisitely beautiful , graceful , fascinating - I experience at the same time a calm , unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a good wife ; that she is not the partner suited to me ; that I should discover this within a year after marriage ; and that to twelve months ' rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret . This I know . "
189818	189822	189823	189823	I	0	" Strange indeed ! "
189829	189835	189836	189836	he	3637	" While something in me , "
189840	189897	189836	189836	he	3637	" is acutely sensible to her charms , something else is as deeply impressed with her defects : they are such that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to - co- operate in nothing I undertook . Rosamond a sufferer , a labourer , a female apostle ? Rosamond a missionary 's wife ? No ! "
189898	189913	189721	189721	he	3637	" But you need not be a missionary . You might relinquish that scheme . "
189914	190022	190028	190028	I	0	" Relinquish ! What ! my vocation ? My great work ? My foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven ? My hopes of being numbered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race - of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance - of substituting peace for war - freedom for bondage - religion for superstition - the hope of heaven for the fear of hell ? Must I relinquish that ? It is dearer than the blood in my veins . It is what I have to look forward to , and to live for . "
190031	190047	190028	190028	I	0	" And Miss Oliver ? Are her disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you ? "
190048	190098	189721	189721	he	3637	" Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers : in less than a month , my image will be effaced from her heart . She will forget me ; and will marry , probably , some one who will make her far happier than I should do . "
190099	190117	190028	190028	I	0	" You speak coolly enough ; but you suffer in the conflict . You are wasting away . "
190118	190189	190028	190028	I	0	" No . If I get a little thin , it is with anxiety about my prospects , yet unsettled - my departure , continually procrastinated . Only this morning , I received intelligence that the successor , whose arrival I have been so long expecting , can not be ready to replace me for three months to come yet ; and perhaps the three months may extend to six . "
190190	190203	190209	190209	his	3639	" You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the schoolroom . "
190289	190294	190296	190296	he	3639	" You are original , "
190298	190438	190296	190296	he	3639	" and not timid . There is something brave in your spirit , as well as penetrating in your eye ; but allow me to assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions . You think them more profound and potent than they are . You give me a larger allowance of sympathy than I have a just claim to . When I colour , and when I shade before Miss Oliver , I do not pity myself . I scorn the weakness . I know it is ignoble : a mere fever of the flesh : not , I declare , the convulsion of the soul . THAT is just as fixed as a rock , firm set in the depths of a restless sea . Know me to be what I am - a cold hard man . "
190443	190452	190453	190453	he	3644	" You have taken my confidence by storm , "
190456	190607	190453	190453	he	3644	" and now it is much at your service . I am simply , in my original state - stripped of that blood - bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity - a cold , hard , ambitious man . Natural affection only , of all the sentiments , has permanent power over me . Reason , and not feeling , is my guide ; my ambition is unlimited : my desire to rise higher , to do more than others , insatiable . I honour endurance , perseverance , industry , talent ; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence . I watch your career with interest , because I consider you a specimen of a diligent , orderly , energetic woman : not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through , or what you still suffer . "
190608	190619	190620	190620	I	0	" You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher , "
190623	190824	190620	190620	I	0	" No . There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers : I believe ; and I believe the Gospel . You missed your epithet . I am not a pagan , but a Christian philosopher - a follower of the sect of Jesus . As His disciple I adopt His pure , His merciful , His benignant doctrines . I advocate them : I am sworn to spread them . Won in youth to religion , she has cultivated my original qualities thus:- From the minute germ , natural affection , she has developed the overshadowing tree , philanthropy . From the wild stringy root of human uprightness , she has reared a due sense of the Divine justice . Of the ambition to win power and renown for my wretched self , she has formed the ambition to spread my Master 's kingdom ; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross . So much has religion done for me ; turning the original materials to the best account ; pruning and training nature . But she could not eradicate nature : nor will it be eradicated ' till this mortal shall put on immortality . ' "
190851	190856	190857	190857	he	3645	" She IS lovely , "
190860	190873	190857	190857	he	3645	" She is well named the Rose of the World , indeed ! "
190874	190886	190845	190845	he	3645	" And may I not paint one like it for you ? "
190887	190893	190894	190894	He	3645	" CUI BONO ? No . "
191028	191034	191035	191035	I	0	" What is the matter ? "
191038	191044	191057	191057	him	3645	" Nothing in the world , "
191080	191085	191086	191086	he	3645	" good - afternoon , "
191089	191092	191093	191093	I	0	" Well ! "
191103	191111	191093	191093	I	0	" that caps the globe , however ! "
191272	191275	191265	191265	I	0	" Marmion , "
191279	191323	191265	191265	I	0	" Day set on Norham 's castled steep , And Tweed 's fair river broad and deep , And Cheviot 's mountains lone ; The massive towers , the donjon keep , The flanking walls that round them sweep , In yellow lustre shone "
191413	191418	191419	191419	I	0	" Any ill news ? "
191422	191427	191419	191419	I	0	" Has anything happened ? "
191428	191438	191439	191439	he	177	" No . How very easily alarmed you are ! "
191475	191485	191487	191487	he	177	" I shall sully the purity of your floor , "
191489	191498	191487	191487	he	177	" but you must excuse me for once . "
191505	191519	191520	191520	he	177	" I have had hard work to get here , I assure you , "
191532	191550	191524	191524	he	177	" One drift took me up to the waist ; happily the snow is quite soft yet . "
191551	191558	191559	191559	I	0	" But why are you come ? "
191565	191634	191635	191635	He	177	" Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor ; but since you ask it , I answer simply to have a little talk with you ; I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms . Besides , since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half- told , and who is impatient to hear the sequel . "
191805	191839	191799	191799	I	0	" I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you : it is too bad that you should be quite alone ; and you are recklessly rash about your own health . "
191840	191845	191847	191847	he	177	" Not at all , "
191849	191870	191847	191847	he	177	" I care for myself when necessary . I am well now . What do you see amiss in me ? "
191949	191954	191955	191955	he	177	" No , no ! "
191962	191965	191966	191966	I	0	" Well , "
191969	191994	191966	191966	I	0	" if you wo n't talk , you may be still ; I 'll let you alone now , and return to my book . "
192005	192008	192009	192009	He	177	" Marmion . "
192094	192104	192081	192081	he	177	" Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately ? "
192105	192117	192081	192081	he	177	" Not since the letter I showed you a week ago . "
192118	192144	192081	192081	he	177	" There has not been any change made about your own arrangements ? You will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected ? "
192145	192161	192081	192081	he	177	" I fear not , indeed : such chance is too good to befall me . "
192183	192227	192171	192171	I	0	" Mary Garrett 's mother is better , and Mary came back to the school this morning , and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close - they would have come to - day but for the snow . "
192228	192231	192081	192081	he	177	" Indeed ! "
192232	192239	192324	192324	him	3651	" Mr. Oliver pays for two . "
192240	192244	192171	192171	I	0	" Does he ? "
192245	192258	192081	192081	he	177	" He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas . "
192259	192263	192324	192324	him	3651	" I know . "
192264	192270	192171	192171	I	0	" Was it your suggestion ? "
192271	192274	192081	192081	he	177	" No . "
192275	192280	192324	192324	him	3651	" Whose , then ? "
192281	192289	192171	192171	I	0	" His daughter 's , I think . "
192290	192303	192171	192171	I	0	" It is like her : she is so good - natured . "
192304	192307	192324	192324	him	3651	" Yes . "
192338	192353	192354	192354	he	3651	" Leave your book a moment , and come a little nearer the fire , "
192370	192378	192379	192379	he	3651	" Half - an - hour ago , "
192382	192472	192379	192379	he	3651	" I spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of a tale : on reflection , I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming the narrator 's part , and converting you into a listener . Before commencing , it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears ; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips . For the rest , whether trite or novel , it is short . "
192824	192825	192811	192811	she	432	" "
192829	192833	192826	192827	Mr. Rivers	177	" I interrupted . "
192840	192844	192834	192834	I	0	" he said , "

193217	193295	193298	193298	Edward	377	" I felt cold and dismayed : my worst fears then were probably true : he had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the Continent . And what opiate for his severe sufferings - what object for his strong passions - had he sought there ? I dared not answer the question . Oh , my poor master - once almost my husband - whom I had often called "
193300	193301	193298	193298	Edward	377	" "
193310	193315	193316	193316	You	3687	" observed Mr. Rivers . "
193330	193337	193316	193316	You	3687	" I said , with warmth . "
193341	193346	193316	193316	You	3687	" he answered quietly : "
193410	193498	193499	193500	JANE EYRE	146	" And the pocket - book was again deliberately produced , opened , sought through ; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper , hastily torn off : I recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra - marine , and lake , and vermillion , the ravished margin of the portrait - cover . He got up , held it close to my eyes : and I read , traced in Indian ink , in my own handwriting , the words "
193501	193512	193513	193513	Briggs	376	" - the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction . "
193522	193526	193513	193513	Briggs	376	" he said , "

193731	193737	193723	193723	You	0	" resumed St. John presently : "
193772	194031	194032	194032	You	3691	" Here was a new card turned up ! It is a fine thing , reader , to be lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth - a very fine thing ; but not a matter one can comprehend , or consequently enjoy , all at once . And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture - giving : THIS is solid , an affair of the actual world , nothing ideal about it : all its associations are solid and sober , and its manifestations are the same . One does not jump , and spring , and shout hurrah ! at hearing one has got a fortune ; one begins to consider responsibilities , and to ponder business ; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares , and we contain ourselves , and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow . Besides , the words Legacy , Bequest , go side by side with the words , Death , Funeral . My uncle I had heard was dead - my only relative ; ever since being made aware of his existence , I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him : now , I never should . And then this money came only to me : not to me and a rejoicing family , but to my isolated self . It was a grand boon doubtless ; and independence would be glorious - yes , I felt that - that thought swelled my heart . "
194039	194044	194032	194032	You	3691	" said Mr. Rivers . "

194114	194156	194100	194100	they	3692	" Here was a new stunner - I had been calculating on four or five thousand . This news actually took my breath for a moment : Mr. St. John , whom I had never heard laugh before , laughed now . "
194159	194163	194100	194100	they	3692	" said he , "

194243	194281	194215	194215	you	3691	" I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred . Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on . "

194355	194369	194389	194390	Mr. Briggs	376	" He was lifting the latch : a sudden thought occurred to me . "

194381	194382	194389	194390	Mr. Briggs	376	" "

194471	194499	194446	194447	the clergy	3696	" I exclaimed : and indeed there was something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which , instead of allaying , piqued my curiosity more than ever . "
194509	194513	194446	194447	the clergy	3696	" I added ; "

194646	194650	194642	194644	a hard man	3697	" said he , "

Circumstances knit themselves , fitted themselves , shot into order : the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight , - every ring was perfect , the connection complete . I knew , by instinct , how the matter stood , before St. John had said another word ; but I can not expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception , so I must repeat his explanation . "
195167	195182	195162	195162	You	3718	" Again he was going , but I set my back against the door . "
195188	195192	195162	195162	You	3718	" I said ; "
195204	195224	195194	195194	me	0	" I paused - he stood before me , hat in hand , looking composed enough . I resumed - "

195312	195512	195515	195515	I	0	" I surveyed him . It seemed I had found a brother : one I could be proud of , - one I could love ; and two sisters , whose qualities were such , that , when I knew them but as mere strangers , they had inspired me with genuine affection and admiration . The two girls , on whom , kneeling down on the wet ground , and looking through the low , latticed window of Moor House kitchen , I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair , were my near kinswomen ; and the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation . Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch ! This was wealth indeed ! - wealth to the heart ! - a mine of pure , genial affections . This was a blessing , bright , vivid , and exhilarating ; - not like the ponderous gift of gold : rich and welcome enough in its way , but sobering from its weight . I now clapped my hands in sudden joy - my pulse bounded , my veins thrilled . "
195524	195532	195520	195520	I	0	" I exclaimed . St. John smiled . "
195545	195549	195534	195534	I	0	" he asked . "

195645	195914	195637	195637	I	0	" I walked fast through the room : I stopped , half suffocated with the thoughts that rose faster than I could receive , comprehend , settle them:- thoughts of what might , could , would , and should be , and that ere long . I looked at the blank wall : it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars , - every one lit me to a purpose or delight . Those who had saved my life , whom , till this hour , I had loved barrenly , I could now benefit . They were under a yoke , - I could free them : they were scattered , - I could reunite them : the independence , the affluence which was mine , might be theirs too . Were we not four ? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each , justice - enough and to spare : justice would be done , - mutual happiness secured . Now the wealth did not weigh on me : now it was not a mere bequest of coin , - it was a legacy of life , hope , enjoyment . How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm , I can not tell ; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me , and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it . He also advised me to be composed ; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction , shook off his hand , and began to walk about again . "

I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had , and arguments I used , to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished . My task was a very hard one ; but , as I was absolutely resolved - as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the property - as they must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the intention ; and must , besides , have been innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do - they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration . The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer : both coincided in my opinion : I carried my point . The instruments of transfer were drawn out : St. John , Diana , Mary , and I , each became possessed of a competency . CHAPTER XXXIV It was near Christmas by the time all was settled : the season of general holiday approached . I now closed Morton school , taking care that the parting should not be barren on my side . Good fortune opens the hand as well as the heart wonderfully ; and to give somewhat when we have largely received , is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations . I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me , and when we parted , that consciousness was confirmed : they manifested their affection plainly and strongly . Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated hearts : I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I did not visit them , and give them an hour 's teaching in their school . Mr. Rivers came up as , having seen the classes , now numbering sixty girls , file out before me , and locked the door , I stood with the key in my hand , exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half - dozen of my best scholars : as decent , respectable , modest , and well - informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry . And that is saying a great deal ; for after all , the British peasantry are the best taught , best mannered , most self - respecting of any in Europe : since those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen ; and the best of them seemed to me ignorant , coarse , and besotted , compared with my Morton girls .

198552	198972	198529	198529	you	146	" Happy at Moor House I was , and hard I worked ; and so did Hannah : she was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned topsy - turvy - how I could brush , and dust , and clean , and cook . And really , after a day or two of confusion worse confounded , it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made . I had previously taken a journey to S- to purchase some new furniture : my cousins having given me CARTE BLANCHE to effect what alterations I pleased , and a sum having been set aside for that purpose . The ordinary sitting - room and bedrooms I left much as they were : for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables , and chairs , and beds , than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations . Still some novelty was necessary , to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested . Dark handsome new carpets and curtains , an arrangement of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze , new coverings , and mirrors , and dressing - cases , for the toilet tables , answered the end : they looked fresh without being glaring . A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely , with old mahogany and crimson upholstery : I laid canvas on the passage , and carpets on the stairs . When all was finished , I thought Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within , as it was , at this season , a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness without . The eventful Thursday at length came . They were expected about dark , and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below ; the kitchen was in perfect trim ; Hannah and I were dressed , and all was in readiness . St. John arrived first . I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the house till everything was arranged : and , indeed , the bare idea of the commotion , at once sordid and trivial , going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to estrangement . He found me in the kitchen , watching the progress of certain cakes for tea , then baking . Approaching the hearth , he asked , "
198984	199117	199122	199122	he	3783	" I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours . With some difficulty , I got him to make the tour of the house . He just looked in at the doors I opened ; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs , he said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time : but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his abode . This silence damped me . I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed some old associations he valued . I inquired whether this was the case : no doubt in a somewhat crest - fallen tone . "
199193	199485	199184	199184	I	0	" I showed him the volume on the shelf : he took it down , and withdrawing to his accustomed window recess , he began to read it . Now , I did not like this , reader . St. John was a good man ; but I began to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold . The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him - its peaceful enjoyments no charm . Literally , he lived only to aspire - after what was good and great , certainly ; but still he would never rest , nor approve of others resting round him . As I looked at his lofty forehead , still and pale as a white stone - at his fine lineaments fixed in study - I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband : that it would be a trying thing to be his wife . I understood , as by inspiration , the nature of his love for Miss Oliver ; I agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses . I comprehended how he should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him ; how he should wish to stifle and destroy it ; how he should mistrust its ever conducting permanently to his happiness or hers . I saw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes - Christian and Pagan - her lawgivers , her statesmen , her conquerors : a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest upon ; but , at the fireside , too often a cold cumbrous column , gloomy and out of place . "
199493	199497	199184	199184	I	0	" I reflected : "
199610	199611	199612	199612	They	3791	" "
199620	200093	200094	200096	a poor lad	3792	" cried Hannah , throwing open the parlour door . At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully . Out I ran . It was now dark ; but a rumbling of wheels was audible . Hannah soon had a lantern lit . The vehicle had stopped at the wicket ; the driver opened the door : first one well - known form , then another , stepped out . In a minute I had my face under their bonnets , in contact first with Mary 's soft cheek , then with Diana 's flowing curls . They laughed - kissed me - then Hannah : patted Carlo , who was half wild with delight ; asked eagerly if all was well ; and being assured in the affirmative , hastened into the house . They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross , and chilled with the frosty night air ; but their pleasant countenances expanded to the cheerful firelight . While the driver and Hannah brought in the boxes , they demanded St. John . At this moment he advanced from the parlour . They both threw their arms round his neck at once . He gave each one quiet kiss , said in a low tone a few words of welcome , stood a while to be talked to , and then , intimating that he supposed they would soon rejoin him in the parlour , withdrew there as to a place of refuge . I had lit their candles to go upstairs , but Diana had first to give hospitable orders respecting the driver ; this done , both followed me . They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms ; with the new drapery , and fresh carpets , and rich tinted china vases : they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly . I had the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly , and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home . Sweet was that evening . My cousins , full of exhilaration , were so eloquent in narrative and comment , that their fluency covered St. John 's taciturnity : he was sincerely glad to see his sisters ; but in their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise . The event of the day - that is , the return of Diana and Mary - pleased him ; but the accompaniments of that event , the glad tumult , the garrulous glee of reception irked him : I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come . In the very meridian of the night 's enjoyment , about an hour after tea , a rap was heard at the door . Hannah entered with the intimation that "
200119	200120	200107	200108	Mr. Rivers	177	" "
200128	200129	200123	200123	she	544	" "
200149	200150	200152	200152	him	3792	" "
200157	200158	200152	200152	him	3792	" "
200226	200492	200209	200209	You	4374	" But he was already in the passage , putting on his cloak ; and without one objection , one murmur , he departed . It was then nine o'clock : he did not return till midnight . Starved and tired enough he was : but he looked happier than when he set out . He had performed an act of duty ; made an exertion ; felt his own strength to do and deny , and was on better terms with himself . I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience . It was Christmas week : we took to no settled employment , but spent it in a sort of merry domestic dissipation . The air of the moors , the freedom of home , the dawn of prosperity , acted on Diana and Mary 's spirits like some life - giving elixir : they were gay from morning till noon , and from noon till night . They could always talk ; and their discourse , witty , pithy , original , had such charms for me , that I preferred listening to , and sharing in it , to doing anything else . St. John did not rebuke our vivacity ; but he escaped from it : he was seldom in the house ; his parish was large , the population scattered , and he found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts . One morning at breakfast , Diana , after looking a little pensive for some minutes , asked him , "
200500	200501	200209	200209	You	4374	" "
200506	200531	200209	200209	You	4374	" was the reply . And he proceeded to inform us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the ensuing year . "
200536	200596	200533	200534	Rosamond Oliver	425	" suggested Mary , the words seeming to escape her lips involuntarily : for no sooner had she uttered them , than she made a gesture as if wishing to recall them . St. John had a book in his hand - it was his unsocial custom to read at meals - he closed it , and looked up , "
200600	200604	200533	200534	Rosamond Oliver	425	" said he , "
200643	200667	200639	200640	her father	1141	" His sisters looked at each other and at me ; we all three looked at him : he was serene as glass . "
200677	200681	200639	200640	her father	1141	" said Diana : "
200691	200692	200682	200682	they	3805	" "
200762	200974	200975	200975	You	3807	" The first time I found St. John alone after this communication , I felt tempted to inquire if the event distressed him : but he seemed so little to need sympathy , that , so far from venturing to offer him more , I experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already hazarded . Besides , I was out of practice in talking to him : his reserve was again frozen over , and my frankness was congealed beneath it . He had not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters ; he continually made little chilling differences between us , which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality : in short , now that I was acknowledged his kinswoman , and lived under the same roof with him , I felt the distance between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the village schoolmistress . When I remembered how far I had once been admitted to his confidence , I could hardly comprehend his present frigidity . Such being the case , I felt not a little surprised when he raised his head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping , and said - "
200989	201010	200975	200975	You	3807	" Startled at being thus addressed , I did not immediately reply : after a moment 's hesitation I answered - "
201039	201040	201041	201041	I	0	" "
201088	201379	201082	201082	I	0	" So saying , he returned to his papers and his silence . As our mutual happiness i.e. , Diana 's , Mary 's , and mine settled into a quieter character , and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies , St. John stayed more at home : he sat with us in the same room , sometimes for hours together . While Mary drew , Diana pursued a course of encyclopaedic reading she had to my awe and amazement undertaken , and I fagged away at German , he pondered a mystic lore of his own : that of some Eastern tongue , the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his plans . Thus engaged , he appeared , sitting in his own recess , quiet and absorbed enough ; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish - looking grammar , and wandering over , and sometimes fixing upon us , his fellow - students , with a curious intensity of observation : if caught , it would be instantly withdrawn ; yet ever and anon , it returned searchingly to our table . I wondered what it meant : I wondered , too , at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment , namely , my weekly visit to Morton school ; and still more was I puzzled when , if the day was unfavourable , if there was snow , or rain , or high wind , and his sisters urged me not to go , he would invariably make light of their solicitude , and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to the elements . "
201392	201444	201082	201082	I	0	" he would say : ' she can bear a mountain blast , or a shower , or a few flakes of snow , as well as any of us . Her constitution is both sound and elastic ; - better calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust . "
201619	201627	201673	201673	He	3811	" Jane , what are you doing ? "
201628	201632	201673	201673	He	3811	" Learning German . "
201633	201645	201673	201673	He	3811	" I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee . "
201646	201653	201673	201673	He	3811	" You are not in earnest ? "
201654	201672	201673	201673	He	3811	" In such earnest that I must have it so : and I will tell you why . "
201883	201888	201879	201879	He	177	" I know it . "
202032	202035	202030	202030	he	177	" go , "
202039	202042	202030	202030	he	177	" come , "
202046	202050	202051	202051	I	0	" do this , "
202155	202183	202184	202184	She	400	" St. John ! you used to call Jane your third sister , but you do n't treat her as such : you should kiss her too . "
203154	203170	203150	203150	he	4906	" We will wait a few minutes , Jane , till you are more composed . "
203262	203277	203246	203247	St. John	177	" Now , Jane , you shall take a walk ; and with me . "
203278	203286	203246	203247	St. John	177	" I will call Diana and Mary . "
203287	203335	203336	203336	I	0	" No ; I want only one companion this morning , and that must be you . Put on your things ; go out by the kitchen - door : take the road towards the head of Marsh Glen : I will join you in a moment . "
203564	203570	203572	203573	St. John	177	" Let us rest here , "
203737	203745	203746	203746	he	177	" And I shall see it again , "
203750	203782	203746	203746	he	177	" in dreams when I sleep by the Ganges : and again in a more remote hour - when another slumber overcomes me - on the shore of a darker stream ! "
203829	203855	203826	203826	he	177	" Jane , I go in six weeks ; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails on the 20th of June . "
203856	203869	203870	203870	I	0	" God will protect you ; for you have undertaken His work , "
203873	203876	203878	203878	he	177	" Yes , "
203880	203963	203878	203878	he	177	" there is my glory and joy . I am the servant of an infallible Master . I am not going out under human guidance , subject to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow - worms : my king , my lawgiver , my captain , is the All - perfect . It seems strange to me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner , - to join in the same enterprise . "
203964	203987	203826	203826	he	177	" All have not your powers , and it would be folly for the feeble to wish to march with the strong . "
203988	204019	203878	203878	he	177	" I do not speak to the feeble , or think of them : I address only such as are worthy of the work , and competent to accomplish it . "
204020	204032	203878	203878	he	177	" Those are few in number , and difficult to discover . "
204033	204100	203826	203826	he	177	" You say truly ; but when found , it is right to stir them up - to urge and exhort them to the effort - to show them what their gifts are , and why they were given - to speak Heaven 's message in their ear , - to offer them , direct from God , a place in the ranks of His chosen . "
204101	204125	204126	204126	I	0	" If they are really qualified for the task , will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it ? "
204159	204167	204169	204170	St. John	177	" And what does YOUR heart say ? "
204172	204184	204185	204185	I	0	" My heart is mute , - my heart is mute , "
204192	204200	204169	204170	St. John	177	" Then I must speak for it , "
204208	204226	204169	204170	St. John	177	" Jane , come with me to India : come as my helpmeet and fellow - labourer . "
204264	204271	204257	204257	him	177	" Come over and help us ! "
204294	204300	204301	204301	I	0	" Oh , St. John ! "
204304	204309	204301	204301	I	0	" have some mercy ! "
204335	204401	204332	204332	He	3872	" God and nature intended you for a missionary 's wife . It is not personal , but mental endowments they have given you : you are formed for labour , not for love . A missionary 's wife you must - shall be . You shall be mine : I claim you - not for my pleasure , but for my Sovereign 's service . "
204402	204415	204416	204416	I	0	" I am not fit for it : I have no vocation , "
204498	204503	204505	204505	he	3872	" Humility , Jane , "
204507	204673	204505	204505	he	3872	" is the groundwork of Christian virtues : you say right that you are not fit for the work . Who is fit for it ? Or who , that ever was truly called , believed himself worthy of the summons ? I , for instance , am but dust and ashes . With St. Paul , I acknowledge myself the chiefest of sinners ; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal vileness to daunt me . I know my Leader : that He is just as well as mighty ; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task , He will , from the boundless stores of His providence , supply the inadequacy of the means to the end . Think like me , Jane - trust like me . It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on : do not doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness . "
204674	204690	204455	204455	his	3872	" I do not understand a missionary life : I have never studied missionary labours . "
204691	204762	204505	204505	he	3872	" There I , humble as I am , can give you the aid you want : I can set you your task from hour to hour ; stand by you always ; help you from moment to moment . This I could do in the beginning : soon for I know your powers you would be as strong and apt as myself , and would not require my help . "
204763	204855	204505	204505	he	3872	" But my powers - where are they for this undertaking ? I do not feel them . Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk . I am sensible of no light kindling - no life quickening - no voice counselling or cheering . Oh , I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon , with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths - the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I can not accomplish ! "
204856	205147	205148	205148	My	0	" I have an answer for you - hear it . I have watched you ever since we first met : I have made you my study for ten months . I have proved you in that time by sundry tests : and what have I seen and elicited ? In the village school I found you could perform well , punctually , uprightly , labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations ; I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact : you could win while you controlled . In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich , I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:- lucre had no undue power over you . In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares , keeping but one to yourself , and relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice , I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of sacrifice . In the tractability with which , at my wish , you forsook a study in which you were interested , and adopted another because it interested me ; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since persevered in it - in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties - I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek . Jane , you are docile , diligent , disinterested , faithful , constant , and courageous ; very gentle , and very heroic : cease to mistrust yourself - I can trust you unreservedly . As a conductress of Indian schools , and a helper amongst Indian women , your assistance will be to me invaluable . "
205241	205245	205246	205246	he	3873	" Very willingly , "
205275	205295	205296	205296	I	0	" I CAN do what he wants me to do : I am forced to see and acknowledge that , "
205300	205702	205296	205296	I	0	" that is , if life be spared me . But I feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun . What then ? He does not care for that : when my time came to die , he would resign me , in all serenity and sanctity , to the God who gave me . The case is very plain before me . In leaving England , I should leave a loved but empty land - Mr. Rochester is not there ; and if he were , what is , what can that ever be to me ? My business is to live without him now : nothing so absurd , so weak as to drag on from day to day , as if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances , which might reunite me to him . Of course as St. John once said I must seek another interest in life to replace the one lost : is not the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign ? Is it not , by its noble cares and sublime results , the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes ? I believe I must say , Yes - and yet I shudder . Alas ! If I join St. John , I abandon half myself : if I go to India , I go to premature death . And how will the interval between leaving England for India , and India for the grave , be filled ? Oh , I know well ! That , too , is very clear to my vision . By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache , I SHALL satisfy him - to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations . If I DO go with him - if I DO make the sacrifice he urges , I will make it absolutely : I will throw all on the altar - heart , vitals , the entire victim . He will never love me ; but he shall approve me ; I will show him energies he has not yet seen , resources he has never suspected . Yes , I can work as hard as he can , and with as little grudging . "
205895	205934	205889	205889	I	0	" I looked towards the knoll : there he lay , still as a prostrate column ; his face turned to me : his eye beaming watchful and keen . He started to his feet and approached me . "
205949	205950	205951	205951	Your	0	" "
205957	205961	205951	205951	Your	0	" he said ; "

205997	206003	206004	206005	Adopted fraternity	3885	" He shook his head . "
206084	206132	206133	206134	St. John	177	" I did consider ; and still my sense , such as it was , directed me only to the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should : and therefore it inferred we ought not to marry . I said so . "
206136	206140	206133	206134	St. John	177	" I returned , "
206160	206161	206162	206162	We	3891	" "
206170	206180	206162	206162	We	3891	" he answered , with short , sharp determination : "
206204	206205	206199	206199	you	177	" "
206208	206209	206199	206199	you	177	" "
206385	206406	206366	206367	a wife	5665	" I shuddered as he spoke : I felt his influence in my marrow - his hold on my limbs . "
206423	206424	206414	206415	St. John	177	" "
206472	206473	206469	206470	the missionary	3902	" "

206603	206841	206843	206843	she	3905	" I will not swear , reader , that there was not something of repressed sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence , and in the feeling that accompanied it . I had silently feared St. John till now , because I had not understood him . He had held me in awe , because he had held me in doubt . How much of him was saint , how much mortal , I could not heretofore tell : but revelations were being made in this conference : the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes . I saw his fallibilities : I comprehended them . I understood that , sitting there where I did , on the bank of heath , and with that handsome form before me , I sat at the feet of a man , caring as I. The veil fell from his hardness and despotism . Having felt in him the presence of these qualities , I felt his imperfection and took courage . I was with an equal - one with whom I might argue - one whom , if I saw good , I might resist . He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence , and I presently risked an upward glance at his countenance . His eye , bent on me , expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry . "
206851	206857	206843	206843	she	3905	" it seemed to say . "
206863	206864	206843	206843	she	3905	" "
206877	206883	206849	206849	ME	0	" he said ere long ; "

207057	207359	207055	207055	I	0	" I said briefly ; and I looked at his features , beautiful in their harmony , but strangely formidable in their still severity ; at his brow , commanding but not open ; at his eyes , bright and deep and searching , but never soft ; at his tall imposing figure ; and fancied myself in idea HIS WIFE . Oh ! it would never do ! As his curate , his comrade , all would be right : I would cross oceans with him in that capacity ; toil under Eastern suns , in Asian deserts with him in that office ; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour ; accommodate quietly to his masterhood ; smile undisturbed at his ineradicable ambition ; discriminate the Christian from the man : profoundly esteem the one , and freely forgive the other . I should suffer often , no doubt , attached to him only in this capacity : my body would be under rather a stringent yoke , but my heart and mind would be free . I should still have my unblighted self to turn to : my natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness . There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine , to which he never came , and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity could never blight , nor his measured warrior - march trample down : but as his wife - at his side always , and always restrained , and always checked - forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low , to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry , though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital - THIS would be unendurable . "
207363	207377	207360	207361	St. John	177	" I exclaimed , when I had got so far in my meditation . "
207380	207385	207386	207386	I	0	" he answered icily . "
207418	207419	207423	207423	me	0	" "
207428	207433	207423	207423	me	0	" he answered steadily ; "

207494	207499	207512	207514	your real sister	3920	" I said shortly ; "

207585	207586	207574	207575	a woman	4399	" "
207591	207598	207574	207575	a woman	4399	" I affirmed with some disdain , "
207658	207659	207638	207638	you	177	" "
207666	207674	207638	207638	you	177	" he said , speaking to himself ; "

207753	207776	207746	207746	I	0	" I could not help saying , as I rose up and stood before him , leaning my back against the rock . "
207799	207841	207791	207791	I	0	" He looked at me fixedly , compressing his well - cut lips while he did so . Whether he was incensed or surprised , or what , it was not easy to tell : he could command his countenance thoroughly . "
207852	207856	207850	207850	you	0	" he said : "
207869	207887	207859	207859	I	0	" I was touched by his gentle tone , and overawed by his high , calm mien . "
207974	207975	207961	207961	My	0	" "
207978	207982	207961	207961	My	0	" said he ; "
208140	208152	208159	208159	hill	3939	" He had done . Turning from me , he once more "
208161	208353	208159	208159	hill	3939	" But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart : I was not worthy to hear them uttered . As I walked by his side homeward , I read well in his iron silence all he felt towards me : the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature , which has met resistance where it expected submission - the disapprobation of a cool , inflexible judgment , which has detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to sympathise : in short , as a man , he would have wished to coerce me into obedience : it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with my perversity , and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance . That night , after he had kissed his sisters , he thought proper to forget even to shake hands with me , but left the room in silence . I - who , though I had no love , had much friendship for him - was hurt by the marked omission : so much hurt that tears started to my eyes . "
208366	208370	208364	208364	Jane	146	" said Diana , "
208399	208433	208393	208393	he	177	" I have not much pride under such circumstances : I would always rather be happy than dignified ; and I ran after him - he stood at the foot of the stairs . "
208441	208444	208438	208439	St. John	177	" said I. "
208451	208456	208449	208449	Jane	146	" he replied calmly . "
208461	209224	209225	209226	St. John	177	" I added . What a cold , loose touch , he impressed on my fingers ! He was deeply displeased by what had occurred that day ; cordiality would not warm , nor tears move him . No happy reconciliation was to be had with him - no cheering smile or generous word : but still the Christian was patient and placid ; and when I asked him if he forgave me , he answered that he was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation ; that he had nothing to forgive , not having been offended . And with that answer he left me . I would much rather he had knocked me down . CHAPTER XXXV He did not leave for Cambridge the next day , as he had said he would . He deferred his departure a whole week , and during that time he made me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern , a conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him . Without one overt act of hostility , one upbraiding word , he contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour . Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness - not that he would have injured a hair of my head , if it had been fully in his power to do so . Both by nature and principle , he was superior to the mean gratification of vengeance : he had forgiven me for saying I scorned him and his love , but he had not forgotten the words ; and as long as he and I lived he never would forget them . I saw by his look , when he turned to me , that they were always written on the air between me and him ; whenever I spoke , they sounded in my voice to his ear , and their echo toned every answer he gave me . He did not abstain from conversing with me : he even called me as usual each morning to join him at his desk ; and I fear the corrupt man within him had a pleasure unimparted to , and unshared by , the pure Christian , in evincing with what skill he could , while acting and speaking apparently just as usual , extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere charm to his language and manner . To me , he was in reality become no longer flesh , but marble ; his eye was a cold , bright , blue gem ; his tongue a speaking instrument - nothing more . All this was torture to me - refined , lingering torture . It kept up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief , which harassed and crushed me altogether . I felt how - if I were his wife , this good man , pure as the deep sunless source , could soon kill me , without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood , or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime . Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him . No ruth met my ruth . HE experienced no suffering from estrangement - no yearning after reconciliation ; and though , more than once , my fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent , they produced no more effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal . To his sisters , meantime , he was somewhat kinder than usual : as if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and banned , he added the force of contrast ; and this I am sure he did not by force , but on principle . The night before he left home , happening to see him walking in the garden about sunset , and remembering , as I looked at him , that this man , alienated as he now was , had once saved my life , and that we were near relations , I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship . I went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate ; I spoke to the point at once . "

209252	209277	209246	209246	I	0	" was the unmoved reply ; while he still watched the rising of the moon , which he had been contemplating as I approached . "
209295	209296	209291	209291	You	177	" "

209393	209477	209383	209383	I	0	" This , spoken in a cool , tranquil tone , was mortifying and baffling enough . Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire , I should immediately have left him ; but something worked within me more strongly than those feelings could . I deeply venerated my cousin 's talent and principle . His friendship was of value to me : to lose it tried me severely . I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it . "
209511	209523	209496	209496	you	177	" He now turned quite from the moon and faced me . "
209546	209547	209548	209548	You	177	" "
209558	209559	209548	209548	You	177	" "
209573	209623	209567	209567	You	177	" Reader , do you know , as I do , what terror those cold people can put into the ice of their questions ? How much of the fall of the avalanche is in their anger ? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure ? "
209641	209660	209635	209635	I	0	" The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward , but it did not yet crash down . "
209668	209672	209635	209635	I	0	" he asked . "
209675	209679	209635	209635	I	0	" I answered , "
209716	209727	209710	209710	You	177	" His lips and cheeks turned white - quite white . "
209795	209837	209839	209839	you	177	" I had finished the business now . While earnestly wishing to erase from his mind the trace of my former offence , I had stamped on that tenacious surface another and far deeper impression , I had burnt it in . "
209845	209849	209839	209839	you	177	" I said . "
209870	209913	209914	209914	You	177	" A fresh wrong did these words inflict : the worse , because they touched on the truth . That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm . I knew the steely ire I had whetted . I was heart - wrung . "
209920	209930	209914	209914	You	177	" I said , at once seizing his hand : "
209947	209962	209943	209943	I	0	" Most bitterly he smiled - most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine . "
209982	209991	209994	209994	I	0	" said he , after a considerable pause . "
210001	210051	209994	209994	I	0	" I answered . A very long silence succeeded . What struggle there was in him between Nature and Grace in this interval , I can not tell : only singular gleams scintillated in his eyes , and strange shadows passed over his face . He spoke at last . "
210115	210131	210137	210138	St. John	177	" I interrupted him . Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at once . "
210205	210228	210229	210231	A female curate	3961	" Again he turned lividly pale ; but , as before , controlled his passion perfectly . He answered emphatically but calmly - "
210320	210361	210395	210395	you	0	" Now I never had , as the reader knows , either given any formal promise or entered into any engagement ; and this language was all much too hard and much too despotic for the occasion . I replied - "
210442	210443	210446	210446	you	0	" "
210452	210460	210461	210461	I	0	" he said , curling his lip . "
210528	210529	210532	210532	you	0	" "
210535	210536	210532	210532	you	0	" "
210574	210575	210576	210576	I	0	" "
210621	210632	210618	210619	Mr. Rochester	251	" It was true . I confessed it by silence . "
210641	210642	210634	210634	you	0	" "
210653	210654	210643	210643	I	0	" "
210662	210666	210658	210658	me	0	" he said , "
210719	210787	210788	210788	Jane	146	" He opened the gate , passed through it , and strayed away down the glen . He was soon out of sight . On re - entering the parlour , I found Diana standing at the window , looking very thoughtful . Diana was a great deal taller than I : she put her hand on my shoulder , and , stooping , examined my face . "
210790	210794	210788	210788	Jane	146	" she said , "
210864	210877	210860	210862	a strange being	3973	" She paused - I did not speak : soon she resumed - "
210928	210939	210924	210924	he	3974	" I put her cool hand to my hot forehead ; "
210948	210949	210924	210924	he	3974	" "
210992	210993	210997	210997	he	3974	" "
211006	211012	210997	210997	he	3974	" Diana clapped her hands . "
211042	211043	211050	211050	his	3974	" "
211070	211071	211074	211074	He	3974	" "
211082	211083	211074	211074	He	3974	" "
211086	211087	211074	211074	He	3974	" "
211090	211094	211074	211074	He	3974	" she exclaimed . "
211122	211123	211118	211118	you	146	" "
211131	211132	211124	211124	I	0	" "
211139	211143	211146	211146	he	3974	" she suggested . "
211165	211166	211156	211156	I	0	" "
211265	211266	211256	211256	You	146	" "
211272	211273	211256	211256	You	146	" "
211281	211282	211275	211275	he	3974	" "
211299	211300	211292	211292	Die	419	" "
211328	211347	211348	211348	I	0	" And again she earnestly conjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother . "
211352	211356	211348	211348	I	0	" I said ; "
211421	211422	211425	211425	you	0	" "
211435	211436	211440	211440	himself	3974	" "
211535	211536	211489	211489	my	0	" "
211546	211547	211489	211489	my	0	" "
211551	211555	211489	211489	my	0	" I continued , "
211668	211669	211665	211665	he	3974	" "
211679	211683	211675	211677	a good man	4605	" said Diana . "
211753	212115	212116	212116	He	3992	" And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden . But I was forced to meet him again at supper . During that meal he appeared just as composed as usual . I had thought he would hardly speak to me , and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial scheme : the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points . He addressed me precisely in his ordinary manner , or what had , of late , been his ordinary manner - one scrupulously polite . No doubt he had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him , and now believed he had forgiven me once more . For the evening reading before prayers , he selected the twenty - first chapter of Revelation . It was at all times pleasant to listen while from his lips fell the words of the Bible : never did his fine voice sound at once so sweet and full - never did his manner become so impressive in its noble simplicity , as when he delivered the oracles of God : and to - night that voice took a more solemn tone - that manner a more thrilling meaning - as he sat in the midst of his household circle the May moon shining in through the uncurtained window , and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table : as he sat there , bending over the great old Bible , and described from its page the vision of the new heaven and the new earth - told how God would come to dwell with men , how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes , and promised that there should be no more death , neither sorrow nor crying , nor any more pain , because the former things were passed away . The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them : especially as I felt , by the slight , indescribable alteration in sound , that in uttering them , his eye had turned on me . "
212140	212147	212158	212158	their	3995	" was slowly , distinctly read , "
212176	212503	212507	212507	Jane	146	" Henceforward , I knew what fate St. John feared for me . A calm , subdued triumph , blent with a longing earnestness , marked his enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter . The reader believed his name was already written in the Lamb 's book of life , and he yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour ; which has no need of sun or moon to shine in it , because the glory of God lightens it , and the Lamb is the light thereof . In the prayer following the chapter , all his energy gathered - all his stern zeal woke : he was in deep earnest , wrestling with God , and resolved on a conquest . He supplicated strength for the weak- hearted ; guidance for wanderers from the fold : a return , even at the eleventh hour , for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from the narrow path . He asked , he urged , he claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning . Earnestness is ever deeply solemn : first , as I listened to that prayer , I wondered at his ; then , when it continued and rose , I was touched by it , and at last awed . He felt the greatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely : others who heard him plead for it , could not but feel it too . The prayer over , we took leave of him : he was to go at a very early hour in the morning . Diana and Mary having kissed him , left the room - in compliance , I think , with a whispered hint from him : I tendered my hand , and wished him a pleasant journey . "
212672	213020	212655	212655	God	180	" He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words . He had spoken earnestly , mildly : his look was not , indeed , that of a lover beholding his mistress , but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering sheep - or better , of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is responsible . All men of talent , whether they be men of feeling or not ; whether they be zealots , or aspirants , or despots - provided only they be sincere - have their sublime moments , when they subdue and rule . I felt veneration for St. John - veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long shunned . I was tempted to cease struggling with him - to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf of his existence , and there lose my own . I was almost as hard beset by him now as I had been once before , in a different way , by another . I was a fool both times . To have yielded then would have been an error of principle ; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment . So I think at this hour , when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time : I was unconscious of folly at the instant . I stood motionless under my hierophant 's touch . My refusals were forgotten - my fears overcome - my wrestlings paralysed . The Impossible - I.E. , my marriage with St. John - was fast becoming the Possible . All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep . Religion called - Angels beckoned - God commanded - life rolled together like a scroll - death 's gates opening , showed eternity beyond : it seemed , that for safety and bliss there , all here might be sacrificed in a second . The dim room was full of visions . "
213026	213126	213022	213022	you	4002	" asked the missionary . The inquiry was put in gentle tones : he drew me to him as gently . Oh , that gentleness ! how far more potent is it than force ! I could resist St. John 's wrath : I grew pliant as a reed under his kindness . Yet I knew all the time , if I yielded now , I should not the less be made to repent , some day , of my former rebellion . His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn prayer : it was only elevated . "
213136	213140	213142	213142	I	0	" I answered : "
213171	213172	213173	213173	My	0	" "
213178	213284	213173	213173	My	0	" ejaculated St. John . He pressed his hand firmer on my head , as if he claimed me : he surrounded me with his arm , ALMOST as if he loved me I say ALMOST - I knew the difference - for I had felt what it was to be loved ; but , like him , I had now put love out of the question , and thought only of duty . I contended with my inward dimness of vision , before which clouds yet rolled . I sincerely , deeply , fervently longed to do what was right ; and only that . "
213293	213460	213173	213173	My	0	" I entreated of Heaven . I was excited more than I had ever been ; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader shall judge . All the house was still ; for I believe all , except St. John and myself , were now retired to rest . The one candle was dying out : the room was full of moonlight . My heart beat fast and thick : I heard its throb . Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through , and passed at once to my head and extremities . The feeling was not like an electric shock , but it was quite as sharp , as strange , as startling : it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had been but torpor , from which they were now summoned and forced to wake . They rose expectant : eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my bones . "
213471	213488	213489	213489	Jane	146	" asked St. John . I saw nothing , but I heard a voice somewhere cry - "
213495	213500	213493	213493	Jane	146	" - nothing more . "
213508	213517	213493	213493	Jane	146	" I gasped . I might have said , "
213522	213617	213493	213493	Jane	146	" for it did not seem in the room - nor in the house - nor in the garden ; it did not come out of the air - nor from under the earth - nor from overhead . I had heard it - where , or whence , for ever impossible to know ! And it was the voice of a human being - a known , loved , well - remembered voice - that of Edward Fairfax Rochester ; and it spoke in pain and woe , wildly , eerily , urgently . "
213622	213626	213493	213493	Jane	146	" I cried . "
213637	213664	213667	213667	you	0	" I flew to the door and looked into the passage : it was dark . I ran out into the garden : it was void . "
213669	213684	213667	213667	you	0	" I exclaimed . The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back - "
213689	213709	213667	213667	you	0	" I listened . The wind sighed low in the firs : all was moorland loneliness and midnight hush . "
213713	213731	213667	213667	you	0	" I commented , as that spectre rose up black by the black yew at the gate . "
213763	214011	213749	213749	She	4004	" I broke from St. John , who had followed , and would have detained me . It was MY time to assume ascendency . MY powers were in play and in force . I told him to forbear question or remark ; I desired him to leave me : I must and would be alone . He obeyed at once . Where there is energy to command well enough , obedience never fails . I mounted to my chamber ; locked myself in ; fell on my knees ; and prayed in my way - a different way to St. John 's , but effective in its own fashion . I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit ; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His feet . I rose from the thanksgiving - took a resolve - and lay down , unscared , enlightened - eager but for the daylight . CHAPTER XXXVI The daylight came . I rose at dawn . I busied myself for an hour or two with arranging my things in my chamber , drawers , and wardrobe , in the order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence . Meantime , I heard St. John quit his room . He stopped at my door : I feared he would knock - no , but a slip of paper was passed under the door . I took it up . It bore these words - "
214103	214104	214097	214097	Yours	4005	" "
214108	214113	214105	214105	My	0	" I answered mentally , "
214181	214251	214265	214265	cousin	6085	" It was the first of June ; yet the morning was overcast and chilly : rain beat fast on my casement . I heard the front - door open , and St. John pass out . Looking through the window , I saw him traverse the garden . He took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross - there he would meet the coach . "
214267	214271	214265	214265	cousin	6085	" thought I : "
214300	214518	214539	214539	him	4009	" It wanted yet two hours of breakfast - time . I filled the interval in walking softly about my room , and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent . I recalled that inward sensation I had experienced : for I could recall it , with all its unspeakable strangeness . I recalled the voice I had heard ; again I questioned whence it came , as vainly as before : it seemed in ME - not in the external world . I asked was it a mere nervous impression - a delusion ? I could not conceive or believe : it was more like an inspiration . The wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas 's prison ; it had opened the doors of the soul 's cell and loosed its bands - it had wakened it out of its sleep , whence it sprang trembling , listening , aghast ; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear , and in my quaking heart and through my spirit , which neither feared nor shook , but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make , independent of the cumbrous body . "
214523	214533	214539	214539	him	4009	" I said , as I terminated my musings , "
214562	214587	214549	214549	Letters	447	" At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey , and should be absent at least four days . "
214592	214596	214590	214590	Jane	146	" they asked . "
214619	215022	214607	214617	a friend about whom I had for some time been uneasy	4010	" They might have said , as I have no doubt they thought , that they had believed me to be without any friends save them : for , indeed , I had often said so ; but , with their true natural delicacy , they abstained from comment , except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to travel . I looked very pale , she observed . I replied , that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind , which I hoped soon to alleviate . It was easy to make my further arrangements ; for I was troubled with no inquiries - no surmises . Having once explained to them that I could not now be explicit about my plans , they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silence with which I pursued them , according to me the privilege of free action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them . I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m. , and soon after four I stood at the foot of the sign - post of Whitcross , waiting the arrival of the coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield . Amidst the silence of those solitary roads and desert hills , I heard it approach from a great distance . It was the same vehicle whence , a year ago , I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot - how desolate , and hopeless , and objectless ! It stopped as I beckoned . I entered - not now obliged to part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation . Once more on the road to Thornfield , I felt like the messenger - pigeon flying home . It was a journey of six - and - thirty hours . I had set out from Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon , and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn , situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North - Midland moors of Morton ! met my eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face . Yes , I knew the character of this landscape : I was sure we were near my bourne . "
215031	215038	215043	215043	ma'am	4353	" I asked of the ostler . "
215049	215050	215043	215043	ma'am	4353	" "
215056	215119	215051	215051	My	0	" I thought to myself . I got out of the coach , gave a box I had into the ostler 's charge , to be kept till I called for it ; paid my fare ; satisfied the coachman , and was going : the brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn , and I read in gilt letters , "
215124	215148	215051	215051	My	0	" My heart leapt up : I was already on my master 's very lands . It fell again : the thought struck it:- "
215222	215227	215215	215215	you	0	" urged the monitor . "
215268	215481	215482	215482	My	0	" The suggestion was sensible , and yet I could not force myself to act on it . I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair . To prolong doubt was to prolong hope . I might yet once more see the Hall under the ray of her star . There was the stile before me - the very fields through which I had hurried , blind , deaf , distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me , on the morning I fled from Thornfield : ere I well knew what course I had resolved to take , I was in the midst of them . How fast I walked ! How I ran sometimes ! How I looked forward to catch the first view of the well - known woods ! With what feelings I welcomed single trees I knew , and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between them ! At last the woods rose ; the rookery clustered dark ; a loud cawing broke the morning stillness . Strange delight inspired me : on I hastened . Another field crossed - a lane threaded - and there were the courtyard walls - the back offices : the house itself , the rookery still hid . "
215492	215496	215482	215482	My	0	" I determined , "
215646	215825	215620	215620	I	0	" I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard - turned its angle : there was a gate just there , opening into the meadow , between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls . From behind one pillar I could peep round quietly at the full front of the mansion . I advanced my head with precaution , desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window - blinds were yet drawn up : battlements , windows , long front - all from this sheltered station were at my command . The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey . I wonder what they thought . They must have considered I was very careful and timid at first , and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless . A peep , and then a long stare ; and then a departure from my niche and a straying out into the meadow ; and a sudden stop full in front of the great mansion , and a protracted , hardy gaze towards it . "
215835	215841	215620	215620	I	0	" they might have demanded ; "
215847	216421	216423	216423	he	4023	" Hear an illustration , reader . A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank ; he wishes to catch a glimpse of her fair face without waking her . He steals softly over the grass , careful to make no sound ; he pauses - fancying she has stirred : he withdraws : not for worlds would he be seen . All is still : he again advances : he bends above her ; a light veil rests on her features : he lifts it , bends lower ; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty - warm , and blooming , and lovely , in rest . How hurried was their first glance ! But how they fix ! How he starts ! How he suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not , a moment since , touch with his finger ! How he calls aloud a name , and drops his burden , and gazes on it wildly ! He thus grasps and cries , and gazes , because he no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter - by any movement he can make . He thought his love slept sweetly : he finds she is stone dead . I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house : I saw a blackened ruin . No need to cower behind a gate - post , indeed ! - to peep up at chamber lattices , fearing life was astir behind them ! No need to listen for doors opening - to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel - walk ! The lawn , the grounds were trodden and waste : the portal yawned void . The front was , as I had once seen it in a dream , but a well - like wall , very high and very fragile - looking , perforated with paneless windows : no roof , no battlements , no chimneys - all had crashed in . And there was the silence of death about it : the solitude of a lonesome wild . No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer : as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle . The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen - by conflagration : but how kindled ? What story belonged to this disaster ? What loss , besides mortar and marble and wood - work had followed upon it ? Had life been wrecked as well as property ? If so , whose ? Dreadful question : there was no one here to answer it - not even dumb sign , mute token . In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated interior , I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late occurrence . Winter snows , I thought , had drifted through that void arch , winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements ; for , amidst the drenched piles of rubbish , spring had cherished vegetation : grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters . And oh ! where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck ? In what land ? Under what auspices ? My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower near the gates , and I asked , "
216438	216551	216425	216427	Damer de Rochester	375	" Some answer must be had to these questions . I could find it nowhere but at the inn , and thither , ere long , I returned . The host himself brought my breakfast into the parlour . I requested him to shut the door and sit down : I had some questions to ask him . But when he complied , I scarcely knew how to begin ; such horror had I of the possible answers . And yet the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for a tale of misery . The host was a respectable - looking , middle - aged man . "
216560	216568	216425	216427	Damer de Rochester	375	" I managed to say at last . "
216578	216579	216581	216581	you	4025	" "
216583	216599	216581	216581	you	4025	" Not in my time , I thought : you are a stranger to me . "
216609	216635	216636	216637	The late	7600	" he added . The late ! I seem to have received , with full force , the blow I had been trying to evade . "
216639	216643	216636	216637	The late	7600	" I gasped . "
216648	216649	216652	216654	the present gentleman	4031	" "
216661	216706	216707	216709	the present gentleman	4031	" he explained . I breathed again : my blood resumed its flow . Fully assured by these words that Mr. Edward - MY Mr. Rochester God bless him , wherever he was ! - was at least alive : was , in short , "
216711	216760	216707	216709	the present gentleman	4031	" Gladdening words ! It seemed I could hear all that was to come - whatever the disclosures might be - with comparative tranquillity . Since he was not in the grave , I could bear , I thought , to learn that he was at the Antipodes . "
216770	216800	216762	216763	Mr. Rochester	251	" I asked , knowing , of course , what the answer would be , but yet desirous of deferring the direct question as to where he really was . "

216918	216934	216909	216909	myself	0	" I muttered . Yes , that was ever the hour of fatality at Thornfield . "
216942	216946	216947	216947	They	4038	" I demanded . "
216973	216990	216967	216967	You	4353	" he continued , edging his chair a little nearer the table , and speaking low , "

I had heard of it before . Mr. Rochester often spoke of it , and sometimes went there . His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game covers . He would have let the house , but could find no tenant , in consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site . Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished , with the exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went there in the season to shoot . To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the characteristics of sad sky , cold gale , and continued small penetrating rain . The last mile I performed on foot , having dismissed the chaise and driver with the double remuneration I had promised . Even when within a very short distance of the manor - house , you could see nothing of it , so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it . Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter , and passing through them , I found myself at once in the twilight of close - ranked trees . There was a grass - grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches . I followed it , expecting soon to reach the dwelling ; but it stretched on and on , it would far and farther : no sign of habitation or grounds was visible . I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way . The darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me . I looked round in search of another road . There was none : all was interwoven stem , columnar trunk , dense summer foliage - no opening anywhere . I proceeded : at last my way opened , the trees thinned a little ; presently I beheld a railing , then the house - scarce , by this dim light , distinguishable from the trees ; so dank and green were its decaying walls . Entering a portal , fastened only by a latch , I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground , from which the wood swept away in a semicircle . There were no flowers , no garden - beds ; only a broad gravel - walk girdling a grass - plat , and this set in the heavy frame of the forest . The house presented two pointed gables in its front ; the windows were latticed and narrow : the front door was narrow too , one step led up to it . The whole looked , as the host of the Rochester Arms had said , "
219281	219311	218765	218765	I	0	" It was as still as a church on a week - day : the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage . "
219318	219828	218765	218765	I	0	" I asked . Yes , life of some kind there was ; for I heard a movement - that narrow front - door was unclosing , and some shape was about to issue from the grange . It opened slowly : a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the step ; a man without a hat : he stretched forth his hand as if to feel whether it rained . Dusk as it was , I had recognised him - it was my master , Edward Fairfax Rochester , and no other . I stayed my step , almost my breath , and stood to watch him - to examine him , myself unseen , and alas ! to him invisible . It was a sudden meeting , and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain . I had no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation , my step from hasty advance . His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever : his port was still erect , his hair was still raven black ; nor were his features altered or sunk : not in one year 's space , by any sorrow , could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted . But in his countenance I saw a change : that looked desperate and brooding - that reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird , dangerous to approach in his sullen woe . The caged eagle , whose gold - ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished , might look as looked that sightless Samson . And , reader , do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity ? - if you do , you little know me . A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock , and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath it : but not yet . I would not accost him yet . He descended the one step , and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the grass - plat . Where was his daring stride now ? Then he paused , as if he knew not which way to turn . He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids ; gazed blank , and with a straining effort , on the sky , and toward the amphitheatre of trees : one saw that all to him was void darkness . He stretched his right hand the left arm , the mutilated one , he kept hidden in his bosom ; he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay around him : he met but vacancy still ; for the trees were some yards off where he stood . He relinquished the endeavour , folded his arms , and stood quiet and mute in the rain , now falling fast on his uncovered head . At this moment John approached him from some quarter . "
219837	219841	219830	219830	you	4145	" he said ; "
219857	219858	219851	219851	you	4145	" "
219863	219925	219851	219851	you	4145	" was the answer . John withdrew without having observed me . Mr. Rochester now tried to walk about : vainly , - all was too uncertain . He groped his way back to the house , and , re - entering it , closed the door . I now drew near and knocked : John 's wife opened for me . "
219928	219932	219851	219851	you	4145	" I said , "
219937	219955	219935	219935	you	233	" She started as if she had seen a ghost : I calmed her . To her hurried "
219973	220125	219959	219959	you	233	" I answered by taking her hand ; and then I followed her into the kitchen , where John now sat by a good fire . I explained to them , in few words , that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield , and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester . I asked John to go down to the turn - pike - house , where I had dismissed the chaise , and bring my trunk , which I had left there : and then , while I removed my bonnet and shawl , I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House for the night ; and finding that arrangements to that effect , though difficult , would not be impossible , I informed her I should stay . Just at this moment the parlour - bell rang . "
220131	220135	219959	219959	you	233	" said I , "
220155	220156	220157	220157	I	0	" "
220166	220170	220171	220171	he	4013	" she answered ; "
220175	220187	220171	220171	he	4013	" When she returned , I inquired what he had said . "
220199	220224	220188	220188	You	0	" she replied . She then proceeded to fill a glass with water , and place it on a tray , together with candles . "
220232	220236	220228	220228	he	4013	" I asked . "
220253	220254	220188	220188	You	0	" "
220267	220442	220261	220261	I	0	" I took it from her hand : she pointed me out the parlour door . The tray shook as I held it ; the water spilt from the glass ; my heart struck my ribs loud and fast . Mary opened the door for me , and shut it behind me . This parlour looked gloomy : a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the grate ; and , leaning over it , with his head supported against the high , old - fashioned mantelpiece , appeared the blind tenant of the room . His old dog , Pilot , lay on one side , removed out of the way , and coiled up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon . Pilot pricked up his ears when I came in : then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine , and bounded towards me : he almost knocked the tray from my hands . I set it on the table ; then patted him , and said softly , "
220446	220469	220261	220261	I	0	" Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to SEE what the commotion was : but as he SAW nothing , he returned and sighed . "
220477	220500	220475	220475	Mary	233	" he said . I approached him with the now only half - filled glass ; Pilot followed me , still excited . "
220506	220510	220513	220513	Pilot	267	" he inquired . "
220515	220545	220513	220513	Pilot	267	" I again said . He checked the water on its way to his lips , and seemed to listen : he drank , and put the glass down . "
220556	220557	220558	220558	Mary	233	" "
220564	220591	220558	220558	Mary	233	" I answered . He put out his hand with a quick gesture , but not seeing where I stood , he did not touch me . "
220600	220622	220558	220558	Mary	233	" he demanded , trying , as it seemed , to SEE with those sightless eyes - unavailing and distressing attempt ! "
220629	220637	220558	220558	Mary	233	" he ordered , imperiously and aloud . "
220658	220662	220648	220648	I	0	" I said . "
220674	220675	220676	220676	Pilot	267	" "

220818	220822	220823	220823	her	4158	" he cried ; "
220838	220867	220890	220890	her	4158	" The muscular hand broke from my custody ; my arm was seized , my shoulder - neck - waist - I was entwined and gathered to him . "
220886	220887	220890	220890	her	4158	" "
220893	220897	220890	220890	her	4158	" I added . "

Perhaps I had too rashly over - leaped conventionalities ; and he , like St. John , saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness . I had indeed made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his wife : an expectation , not the less certain because unexpressed , had buoyed me up , that he would claim me at once as his own . But no hint to that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast , I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong , and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly ; and I began gently to withdraw myself from his arms - but he eagerly snatched me closer .

I , on the contrary , became more cheerful , and took fresh courage : these last words gave me an insight as to where the difficulty lay ; and as it was no difficulty with me , I felt quite relieved from my previous embarrassment . I resumed a livelier vein of conversation . "

My spirits were excited , and with pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper , and for a long time after . There was no harassing restraint , no repressing of glee and vivacity with him ; for with him I was at perfect ease , because I knew I suited him ; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him . Delightful consciousness ! It brought to life and light my whole nature : in his presence I thoroughly lived ; and he lived in mine . Blind as he was , smiles played over his face , joy dawned on his forehead : his lineaments softened and warmed . After supper , he began to ask me many questions , of where I had been , what I had been doing , how I had found him out ; but I gave him only very partial replies : it was too late to enter into particulars that night . Besides , I wished to touch no deep - thrilling chord - to open no fresh well of emotion in his heart : my sole present aim was to cheer him . Cheered , as I have said , he was : and yet but by fits . If a moment 's silence broke the conversation , he would turn restless , touch me , then say , "
222758	222759	222756	222756	Jane	146	" "
222775	222776	222769	222769	You	146	" "
222785	222786	222782	222783	Mr. Rochester	251	" "
222850	222851	222843	222843	your	146	" "
222867	222868	222853	222853	I	0	" "
223015	223084	223011	223011	her	146	" A commonplace , practical reply , out of the train of his own disturbed ideas , was , I was sure , the best and most reassuring for him in this frame of mind . I passed my finger over his eyebrows , and remarked that they were scorched , and that I would apply something which would make them grow as broad and black as ever . "
223132	223144	223011	223011	her	146	" Have you a pocket - comb about you , sir ? "
223145	223151	223011	223011	her	146	" What for , Jane ? "
223152	223196	223011	223011	her	146	" Just to comb out this shaggy black mane . I find you rather alarming , when I examine you close at hand : you talk of my being a fairy , but I am sure , you are more like a brownie . "
223197	223204	223011	223011	her	146	" Am I hideous , Jane ? "
223205	223217	223011	223011	her	146	" Very , sir : you always were , you know . "
223218	223236	223011	223011	her	146	" Humph ! The wickedness has not been taken out of you , wherever you have sojourned . "
223237	223275	223011	223011	her	146	" Yet I have been with good people ; far better than you : a hundred times better people ; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your life : quite more refined and exalted . "
223276	223285	223011	223011	her	146	" Who the deuce have you been with ? "
223286	223319	223011	223011	her	146	" If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your head ; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my substantiality . "
223320	223329	223011	223011	her	146	" Who have you been with , Jane ? "
223330	223419	223011	223011	her	146	" You shall not get it out of me to - night , sir ; you must wait till to - morrow ; to leave my tale half told , will , you know , be a sort of security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it . By the bye , I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of water then : I must bring an egg at the least , to say nothing of fried ham . "
223420	223470	223011	223011	her	146	" You mocking changeling - fairy - born and human - bred ! You make me feel as I have not felt these twelve months . If Saul could have had you for his David , the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the harp . "
223471	223509	223011	223011	her	146	" There , sir , you are redd up and made decent . Now I 'll leave you : I have been travelling these last three days , and I believe I am tired . Good night . "
223510	223529	223530	223530	I	0	" Just one word , Jane : were there only ladies in the house where you have been ? "
223544	223549	223550	223550	I	0	" A good idea ! "
223555	223575	223550	223550	I	0	" I see I have the means of fretting him out of his melancholy for some time to come . "
223606	223612	223598	223598	Mary	233	" Is Miss Eyre here ? "
223615	223647	223648	223648	I	0	" Which room did you put her into ? Was it dry ? Is she up ? Go and ask if she wants anything ; and when she will come down . "
223802	223813	223814	223814	I	0	" It is a bright , sunny morning , sir , "
223817	223841	223814	223814	I	0	" The rain is over and gone , and there is a tender shining after it : you shall have a walk soon . "
223852	223946	223848	223848	his	4204	" Oh , you are indeed there , my skylark ! Come to me . You are not gone : not vanished ? I heard one of your kind an hour ago , singing high over the wood : but its song had no music for me , any more than the rising sun had rays . All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane 's tongue to my ear I am glad it is not naturally a silent one : all the sunshine I can feel is in her presence . "
224129	224240	224118	224118	He	4204	" Cruel , cruel deserter ! Oh , Jane , what did I feel when I discovered you had fled from Thornfield , and when I could nowhere find you ; and , after examining your apartment , ascertained that you had taken no money , nor anything which could serve as an equivalent ! A pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket ; your trunks were left corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour . What could my darling do , I asked , left destitute and penniless ? And what did she do ? Let me hear now . "
224419	224433	224434	224434	I	0	" Well , whatever my sufferings had been , they were very short , "
224509	224520	224482	224484	St. John Rivers	177	" This St. John , then , is your cousin ? "
224521	224524	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" Yes . "
224525	224538	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" You have spoken of him often : do you like him ? "
224539	224556	224482	224484	St. John Rivers	177	" He was a very good man , sir ; I could not help liking him . "
224557	224580	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" A good man . Does that mean a respectable well - conducted man of fifty ? Or what does it mean ? "
224581	224592	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" St John was only twenty - nine , sir . "
224593	224636	224482	224484	St. John Rivers	177	" ' Jeune encore , ' as the French say . Is he a person of low stature , phlegmatic , and plain . A person whose goodness consists rather in his guiltlessness of vice , than in his prowess in virtue . "
224637	224654	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" He is untiringly active . Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to perform . "
224655	224680	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" But his brain ? That is probably rather soft ? He means well : but you shrug your shoulders to hear him talk ? "
224681	224714	224482	224484	St. John Rivers	177	" He talks little , sir : what he does say is ever to the point . His brain is first - rate , I should think not impressible , but vigorous . "
224715	224724	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" Is he an able man , then ? "
224725	224729	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" Truly able . "
224730	224736	224482	224484	St. John Rivers	177	" A thoroughly educated man ? "
224737	224747	224482	224484	St. John Rivers	177	" St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar . "
224748	224768	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" His manners , I think , you said are not to your taste ? - priggish and parsonic ? "
224769	224800	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" I never mentioned his manners ; but , unless I had a very bad taste , they must suit it ; they are polished , calm , and gentlemanlike . "
224801	224844	224482	224484	St. John Rivers	177	" His appearance , - I forget what description you gave of his appearance ; - a sort of raw curate , half strangled with his white neckcloth , and stilted up on his thick - soled high - lows , eh ? "
224845	224870	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" St. John dresses well . He is a handsome man : tall , fair , with blue eyes , and a Grecian profile . "
224873	224877	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" Damn him ! "
224882	224890	224460	224460	schoolmistress	7116	" Did you like him , Jane ? "
224891	224908	224909	224909	I	0	" Yes , Mr. Rochester , I liked him : but you asked me that before . "
224960	224976	224928	224928	she	1762	" Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee , Miss Eyre ? "
224984	224991	224928	224928	she	1762	" Why not , Mr. Rochester ? "
224992	225066	224928	224928	she	1762	" The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too overwhelming contrast . Your words have delineated very prettily a graceful Apollo : he is present to your imagination , - tall , fair , blue - eyed , and with a Grecian profile . Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan , - a real blacksmith , brown , broad - shouldered : and blind and lame into the bargain . "
225067	225086	224928	224928	she	1762	" I never thought of it , before ; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan , sir . "
225087	225101	225103	225103	he	4219	" Well , you can leave me , ma'am : but before you go "
225113	225127	225128	225128	He	4219	" you will be pleased just to answer me a question or two . "
225131	225138	225128	225128	He	4219	" What questions , Mr. Rochester ? "
225146	225162	225128	225128	He	4219	" St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his cousin ? "
225163	225166	224928	224928	she	1762	" Yes . "
225167	225181	224928	224928	she	1762	" You would often see him ? He would visit the school sometimes ? "
225182	225185	225128	225128	He	4219	" Daily . "
225186	225210	225128	225128	He	4219	" He would approve of your plans , Jane ? I know they would be clever , for you are a talented creature ! "
225211	225219	224928	224928	she	1762	" He approved of them - yes . "
225220	225244	225128	225128	He	4219	" He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find ? Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary . "
225245	225253	225128	225128	He	4219	" I do n't know about that . "
225254	225276	224928	224928	she	1762	" You had a little cottage near the school , you say : did he ever come there to see you ? "
225277	225282	224928	224928	she	1762	" Now and then ? "
225283	225288	225128	225128	He	4219	" Of an evening ? "
225289	225294	224928	224928	she	1762	" Once or twice . "
225298	225315	224928	224928	she	1762	" How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship was discovered ? "
225316	225320	224928	224928	she	1762	" Five months . "
225321	225334	224928	224928	she	1762	" Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family ? "
225335	225360	224928	224928	she	1762	" Yes ; the back parlour was both his study and ours : he sat near the window , and we by the table . "
225361	225367	224928	224928	she	1762	" Did he study much ? "
225368	225373	224928	224928	she	1762	" A good deal . "
225374	225377	224928	224928	she	1762	" What ? "
225378	225381	224928	224928	she	1762	" Hindostanee . "
225382	225390	224928	224928	she	1762	" And what did you do meantime ? "
225391	225399	224928	224928	she	1762	" I learnt German , at first . "
225400	225406	224928	224928	she	1762	" Did he teach you ? "
225407	225414	224928	224928	she	1762	" He did not understand German . "
225415	225422	224928	224928	she	1762	" Did he teach you nothing ? "
225423	225428	224928	224928	she	1762	" A little Hindostanee . "
225429	225435	224928	224928	she	1762	" Rivers taught you Hindostanee ? "
225436	225441	224928	224928	she	1762	" Yes , sir . "
225442	225448	224928	224928	she	1762	" And his sisters also ? "
225449	225452	224928	224928	she	1762	" No . "
225453	225457	224928	224928	she	1762	" Only you ? "
225458	225462	224928	224928	she	1762	" Only me . "
225463	225470	224928	224928	she	1762	" Did you ask to learn ? "
225471	225474	224928	224928	she	1762	" No . "
225475	225482	224928	224928	she	1762	" He wished to teach you ? "
225483	225486	224928	224928	she	1762	" Yes . "
225491	225507	224928	224928	she	1762	" Why did he wish it ? Of what use could Hindostanee be to you ? "
225508	225519	224928	224928	she	1762	" He intended me to go with him to India . "
225520	225539	224928	224928	she	1762	" Ah ! here I reach the root of the matter . He wanted you to marry him ? "
225540	225548	224928	224928	she	1762	" He asked me to marry him . "
225549	225562	224928	224928	she	1762	" That is a fiction - an impudent invention to vex me . "
225563	225596	224928	224928	she	1762	" I beg your pardon , it is the literal truth : he asked me more than once , and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be . "
225597	225639	224928	224928	she	1762	" Miss Eyre , I repeat it , you can leave me . How often am I to say the same thing ? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee , when I have given you notice to quit ? "
225640	225647	224928	224928	she	1762	" Because I am comfortable there . "
225648	225763	224928	224928	she	1762	" No , Jane , you are not comfortable there , because your heart is not with me : it is with this cousin - this St. John . Oh , till this moment , I thought my little Jane was all mine ! I had a belief she loved me even when she left me : that was an atom of sweet in much bitter . Long as we have been parted , hot tears as I have wept over our separation , I never thought that while I was mourning her , she was loving another ! But it is useless grieving . Jane , leave me : go and marry Rivers . "
225764	225789	224928	224928	she	1762	" Shake me off , then , sir , - push me away , for I 'll not leave you of my own accord . "
225790	225842	224928	224928	she	1762	" Jane , I ever like your tone of voice : it still renews hope , it sounds so truthful . When I hear it , it carries me back a year . I forget that you have formed a new tie . But I am not a fool - go - "
225843	225851	224928	224928	she	1762	" Where must I go , sir ? "
225852	225864	224928	224928	she	1762	" Your own way - with the husband you have chosen . "
225865	225870	224928	224928	she	1762	" Who is that ? "
225871	225880	224928	224928	she	1762	" You know - this St. John Rivers . "
225881	226036	224928	224928	she	1762	" He is not my husband , nor ever will be . He does not love me : I do not love him . He loves as he CAN love , and that is not as you love a beautiful young lady called Rosamond . He wanted to marry me only because he thought I should make a suitable missionary 's wife , which she would not have done . He is good and great , but severe ; and , for me , cold as an iceberg . He is not like you , sir : I am not happy at his side , nor near him , nor with him . He has no indulgence for me - no fondness . He sees nothing attractive in me ; not even youth - only a few useful mental points . - Then I must leave you , sir , to go to him ? "
226055	226076	226052	226052	He	4220	" What , Jane ! Is this true ? Is such really the state of matters between you and Rivers ? "
226077	226173	226177	226177	he	4221	" Absolutely , sir ! Oh , you need not be jealous ! I wanted to tease you a little to make you less sad : I thought anger would be better than grief . But if you wish me to love you , could you but see how much I DO love you , you would be proud and content . All my heart is yours , sir : it belongs to you ; and with you it would remain , were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence for ever . "
226187	226196	226197	226197	he	4221	" My scarred vision ! My crippled strength ! "
226260	226278	226279	226279	he	4221	" I am no better than the old lightning - struck chestnut - tree in Thornfield orchard , "
226284	226303	226279	226279	he	4221	" And what right would that ruin have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness ? "
226304	226372	226374	226374	he	4221	" You are no ruin , sir - no lightning - struck tree : you are green and vigorous . Plants will grow about your roots , whether you ask them or not , because they take delight in your bountiful shadow ; and as they grow they will lean towards you , and wind round you , because your strength offers them so safe a prop . "
226382	226390	226391	226391	he	4221	" You speak of friends , Jane ? "
226394	226400	226391	226391	he	4221	" Yes , of friends , "
226429	226440	226425	226425	He	4221	" Ah ! Jane . But I want a wife . "
226441	226447	226425	226425	He	4221	" Do you , sir ? "
226448	226457	226425	226425	He	4221	" Yes : is it news to you ? "
226458	226469	226425	226425	He	4221	" Of course : you said nothing about it before . "
226470	226476	226425	226425	He	4221	" Is it unwelcome news ? "
226477	226489	226425	226425	He	4221	" That depends on circumstances , sir - on your choice . "
226490	226507	226425	226425	He	4221	" Which you shall make for me , Jane . I will abide by your decision . "
226508	226520	226425	226425	He	4221	" Choose then , sir - HER WHO LOVES YOU BEST . "
226521	226540	226425	226425	He	4221	" I will at least choose - HER I LOVE BEST . Jane , will you marry me ? "
226541	226546	226425	226425	He	4221	" Yes , sir . "
226547	226564	226425	226425	He	4221	" A poor blind man , whom you will have to lead about by the hand ? "
226565	226570	226425	226425	He	4221	" Yes , sir . "
226571	226590	226425	226425	He	4221	" A crippled man , twenty years older than you , whom you will have to wait on ? "
226591	226596	226425	226425	He	4221	" Yes , sir . "
226597	226602	226425	226425	He	4221	" Truly , Jane ? "
226603	226609	226425	226425	He	4221	" Most truly , sir . "
226610	226623	226425	226425	He	4221	" Oh ! my darling ! God bless you and reward you ! "
226624	226691	226425	226425	He	4221	" Mr. Rochester , if ever I did a good deed in my life - if ever I thought a good thought - if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer - if ever I wished a righteous wish , - I am rewarded now . To be your wife is , for me , to be as happy as I can be on earth . "
226692	226699	226425	226425	He	4221	" Because you delight in sacrifice . "
226700	226761	226425	226425	He	4221	" Sacrifice ! What do I sacrifice ? Famine for food , expectation for content . To be privileged to put my arms round what I value - to press my lips to what I love - to repose on what I trust : is that to make a sacrifice ? If so , then certainly I delight in sacrifice . "
226762	226777	226425	226425	He	4221	" And to bear with my infirmities , Jane : to overlook my deficiencies . "
226778	226826	226425	226425	He	4221	" Which are none , sir , to me . I love you better now , when I can really be useful to you , than I did in your state of proud independence , when you disdained every part but that of the giver and protector . "
226827	226909	226425	226425	He	4221	" Hitherto I have hated to be helped - to be led : henceforth , I feel I shall hate it no more . I did not like to put my hand into a hireling 's , but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane 's little fingers . I preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants ; but Jane 's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy . Jane suits me : do I suit her ? "
226910	226921	226425	226425	He	4221	" To the finest fibre of my nature , sir . "
226922	226944	226425	226425	He	4221	" The case being so , we have nothing in the world to wait for : we must be married instantly . "
226958	226982	226952	226952	his	4223	" We must become one flesh without any delay , Jane : there is but the licence to get - then we marry . "
226983	227017	226425	226425	He	4221	" Mr. Rochester , I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its meridian , and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner . Let me look at your watch . "
227018	227039	226425	226425	He	4221	" Fasten it into your girdle , Janet , and keep it henceforward : I have no use for it . "
227040	227058	226425	226425	He	4221	" It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon , sir . Do n't you feel hungry ? "
227059	227091	226425	226425	He	4221	" The third day from this must be our wedding - day , Jane . Never mind fine clothes and jewels , now : all that is not worth a fillip . "
227092	227116	226425	226425	He	4221	" The sun has dried up all the rain - drops , sir . The breeze is still : it is quite hot . "
227117	227161	226425	226425	He	4221	" Do you know , Jane , I have your little pearl necklace at this moment fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat ? I have worn it since the day I lost my only treasure , as a memento of her . "
227162	227178	226425	226425	He	4221	" We will go home through the wood : that will be the shadiest way . "
227188	227421	226425	226425	He	4221	" Jane ! you think me , I daresay , an irreligious dog : but my heart swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now . He sees not as man sees , but far clearer : judges not as man judges , but far more wisely . I did wrong : I would have sullied my innocent flower - breathed guilt on its purity : the Omnipotent snatched it from me . I , in my stiff - necked rebellion , almost cursed the dispensation : instead of bending to the decree , I defied it . Divine justice pursued its course ; disasters came thick on me : I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death . HIS chastisements are mighty ; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever . You know I was proud of my strength : but what is it now , when I must give it over to foreign guidance , as a child does its weakness ? Of late , Jane - only - only of late - I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom . I began to experience remorse , repentance ; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker . I began sometimes to pray : very brief prayers they were , but very sincere . "
227539	227692	227802	227802	I	0	" I was in my own room , and sitting by the window , which was open : it soothed me to feel the balmy night - air ; though I could see no stars and only by a vague , luminous haze , knew the presence of a moon . I longed for thee , Janet ! Oh , I longed for thee both with soul and flesh ! I asked of God , at once in anguish and humility , if I had not been long enough desolate , afflicted , tormented ; and might not soon taste bliss and peace once more . That I merited all I endured , I acknowledged - that I could scarcely endure more , I pleaded ; and the alpha and omega of my heart 's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words - ' Jane ! Jane ! Jane ! ' "
227693	227701	227807	227807	Jane	146	" Did you speak these words aloud ? "
227702	227730	227802	227802	I	0	" I did , Jane . If any listener had heard me , he would have thought me mad : I pronounced them with such frantic energy . "
227731	227743	227802	227802	I	0	" And it was last Monday night , somewhere near midnight ? "
227744	227800	227802	227802	I	0	" Yes ; but the time is of no consequence : what followed is the strange point . You will think me superstitious , - some superstition I have in my blood , and always had : nevertheless , this is true - true at least it is that I heard what I now relate . "
227863	228026	228027	228027	Reader	387	" I 'll tell you , if I can , the idea , the picture these words opened to my mind : yet it is difficult to express what I want to express . Ferndean is buried , as you see , in a heavy wood , where sound falls dull , and dies unreverberating . ' Where are you ? ' seemed spoken amongst mountains ; for I heard a hill - sent echo repeat the words . Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow : I could have deemed that in some wild , lone scene , I and Jane were meeting . In spirit , I believe we must have met . You no doubt were , at that hour , in unconscious sleep , Jane : perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine ; for those were your accents - as certain as I live - they were yours ! "
228148	228155	228227	228227	He	4336	" You can not now wonder , "
228160	228226	228227	228227	He	4336	" that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night , I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision , something that would melt to silence and annihilation , as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before . Now , I thank God ! I know it to be otherwise . Yes , I thank God ! "
228270	228310	228312	228312	he	4336	" I thank my Maker , that , in the midst of judgment , he has remembered mercy . I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto ! "
228433	228446	228430	228430	I	0	" Mary , I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning . "
228569	228580	228558	228558	Mary	233	" Have you , Miss ? Well , for sure ! "
228588	228613	228615	228615	she	233	" I seed you go out with the master , but I did n't know you were gone to church to be we d ; "
228634	228643	228644	228644	he	177	" I telled Mary how it would be , "
228647	228653	228644	228644	he	177	" I knew what Mr. Edward "
228684	228722	228676	228676	he	177	" I knew what Mr. Edward would do ; and I was certain he would not wait long neither : and he 's done right , for aught I know . I wish you joy , Miss ! "
228730	228747	228724	228724	he	177	" Thank you , John . Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this . "
228786	228801	228781	228781	I	0	" She 'll happen do better for him nor ony o't ' grand ladies . "
228805	228841	228842	228842	I	0	" If she ben't one o ' th ' handsomest , she 's noan faal and varry good - natured ; and i ' his een she 's fair beautiful , onybody may see that . "
228900	228911	228913	228914	Mr. Rochester	251	" She had better not wait till then , Jane , "
228924	228955	228913	228914	Mr. Rochester	251	" if she does , she will be too late , for our honeymoon will shine our life long : its beams will only fade over your grave or mine . "
229825	229837	229815	229815	he	5014	" Jane , have you a glittering ornament round your neck ? "
229848	229851	229815	229815	he	5014	" Yes . "
229852	229862	229863	229863	I	0	" And have you a pale blue dress on ? "
230285	230306	230282	230282	he	4293	" Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross and follow me . "
230517	230521	230522	230522	he	177	" My Master , "
230525	230563	230522	230522	he	177	" has forewarned me . Daily He announces more distinctly , - ' Surely I come quickly ! ' and hourly I more eagerly respond , - ' Amen ; even so come , Lord Jesus ! ' "
