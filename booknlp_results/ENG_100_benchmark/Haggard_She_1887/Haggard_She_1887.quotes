987	998	1548	1548	her	293	" - - College , Cambridge , May 1 , 18 -
999	1459	1548	1548	her	293	" My dear Sir , - You will be surprised , considering the very slight nature of our acquaintance , to get a letter from me . Indeed , I think I had better begin by reminding you that we once met , now some five years ago , when I and my ward Leo Vincey were introduced to you in the street at Cambridge . To be brief and come to my business . I have recently read with much interest a book of yours describing a Central African adventure . I take it that this book is partly true , and partly an effort of the imagination . However this may be , it has given me an idea . It happens , how you will see in the accompanying manuscript which together with the Scarab , the ' Royal Son of the Sun , ' and the original sherd , I am sending to you by hand , that my ward , or rather my adopted son Leo Vincey and myself have recently passed through a real African adventure , of a nature so much more marvellous than the one which you describe , that to tell the truth I am almost ashamed to submit it to you lest you should disbelieve my tale . You will see it stated in this manuscript that I , or rather we , had made up our minds not to make this history public during our joint lives . Nor should we alter our determination were it not for a circumstance which has recently arisen . We are for reasons that , after perusing this manuscript , you may be able to guess , going away again this time to Central Asia where , if anywhere upon this earth , wisdom is to be found , and we anticipate that our sojourn there will be a long one . Possibly we shall not return . Under these altered conditions it has become a question whether we are justified in withholding from the world an account of a phenomenon which we believe to be of unparalleled interest , merely because our private life is involved , or because we are afraid of ridicule and doubt being cast upon our statements . I hold one view about this matter , and Leo holds another , and finally , after much discussion , we have come to a compromise , namely , to send the history to you , giving you full leave to publish it if you think fit , the only stipulation being that you shall disguise our real names , and as much concerning our personal identity as is consistent with the maintenance of the bona fides of the narrative .
1460	1543	1548	1548	her	293	" And now what am I to say further ? I really do not know beyond once more repeating that everything is described in the accompanying manuscript exactly as it happened . As regards She herself I have nothing to add . Day by day we gave greater occasion to regret that we did not better avail ourselves of our opportunities to obtain more information from that marvellous woman . Who was she ? How did she first come to the Caves of K"r
1590	1654	1768	1768	Editor	297	" Will you undertake the task ? We give you complete freedom , and as a reward you will , we believe , have the credit of presenting to the world the most wonderful history , as distinguished from romance , that its records can show . Read the manuscript which I have copied out fairly for your benefit , and let me know .
1655	1663	1664	1666	L. Horace Holly	110	" Believe me , very truly yours , "
1668	1753	1768	1768	Editor	297	" P.S. - Of course , if any profit results from the sale of the writing should you care to undertake its publication , you can do what you like with it , but if there is a loss I will leave instructions with my lawyers , Messrs. Geoffrey and Jordan , to meet it . We entrust the sherd , the scarab , and the parchments to your keeping , till such time as we demand them back again . - L. H. H. "

3473	3476	3477	3477	I	0	" Nonsense ! "
3480	3488	3477	3477	I	0	" Let me go for a doctor . "
3498	3592	3489	3489	He	339	" It is sober sense ; but I want no doctors . I have studied medicine and I know all about it . No doctors can help me . My last hour has come ! For a year past I have only lived by a miracle . Now listen to me as you have never listened to anybody before ; for you will not have the opportunity of getting me to repeat my words . We have been friends for two years ; now tell me how much do you know about me ? "
3593	3651	3495	3495	his	339	" I know that you are rich , and have had a fancy to come to College long after the age that most men leave it . I know that you have been married , and that your wife died ; and that you have been the best , indeed almost the only friend I ever had . "

3663	3666	3495	3495	his	339	" No . "
3667	3722	3489	3489	He	339	" I have . He is five years old . He cost me his mother 's life , and I have never been able to bear to look upon his face in consequence . Holly , if you will accept the trust , I am going to leave you that boy 's sole guardian . "
3731	3734	3735	3735	I	0	" Me ! "
3738	3789	3791	3791	he	340	" Yes , you . I have not studied you for two years for nothing . I have known for some time that I could not last , and since I realised the fact I have been searching for some one to whom I could confide the boy and this , "
3797	4465	4467	4467	he	341	" You are the man , Holly ; for , like a rugged tree , you are hard and sound at core . Listen ; the boy will be the only representative of one of the most ancient families in the world , that is , so far as families can be traced . You will laugh at me when I say it , but one day it will be proved to you beyond a doubt , that my sixty - fifth or sixty - sixth lineal ancestor was an Egyptian priest of Isis , though he was himself of Grecian extraction , and was called Kallikrates . His father was one of the Greek mercenaries raised by Hak - Hor , a Mendesian Pharaoh of the twenty - ninth dynasty , and his grandfather or great - grandfather , I believe , was that very Kallikrates mentioned by Herodotus . In or about the year 339 before Christ , just at the time of the final fall of the Pharaohs , this Kallikrates the priest broke his vows of celibacy and fled from Egypt with a Princess of Royal blood who had fallen in love with him , and was finally wrecked upon the coast of Africa , somewhere , as I believe , in the neighbourhood of where Delagoa Bay now is , or rather to the north of it , he and his wife being saved , and all the remainder of their company destroyed in one way or another . Here they endured great hardships , but were at last entertained by the mighty Queen of a savage people , a white woman of peculiar loveliness , who , under circumstances which I can not enter into , but which you will one day learn , if you live , from the contents of the box , finally murdered my ancestor Kallikrates . His wife , however , escaped , how , I know not , to Athens , bearing a child with her , whom she named Tisisthenes , or the Mighty Avenger . Five hundred years or more afterwards , the family migrated to Rome under circumstances of which no trace remains , and here , probably with the idea of preserving the idea of vengeance which we find set out in the name of Tisisthenes , they appear to have pretty regularly assumed the cognomen of Vindex , or Avenger . Here , too , they remained for another five centuries or more , till about 770 A.D. , when Charlemagne invaded Lombardy , where they were then settled , whereon the head of the family seems to have attached himself to the great Emperor , and to have returned with him across the Alps , and finally to have settled in Brittany . Eight generations later his lineal representative crossed to England in the reign of Edward the Confessor , and in the time of William the Conqueror was advanced to great honour and power . From that time to the present day I can trace my descent without a break . Not that the Vinceys - for that was the final corruption of the name after its bearers took root in English soil - have been particularly distinguished - they never came much to the fore . Sometimes they were soldiers , sometimes merchants , but on the whole they have preserved a dead level of respectability , and a still deader level of mediocrity . From the time of Charles II . till the beginning of the present century they were merchants . About 1790 by grandfather made a considerable fortune out of brewing , and retired . In 1821 he died , and my father succeeded him , and dissipated most of the money . Ten years ago he died also , leaving me a net income of about two thousand a year . Then it was that I undertook an expedition in connection with that , "
4474	4543	4467	4467	he	341	" which ended disastrously enough . On my way back I travelled in the South of Europe , and finally reached Athens . There I met my beloved wife , who might well also have been called the ' Beautiful , ' like my old Greek ancestor . There I married her , and there , a year afterwards , when my boy was born , she died . "
4630	4740	4741	4754	This Kallikrates , who appears to have been as brave as he was beautiful	118	" For Kallikrates died out of the battle , he came to the army the most beautiful man of the Greeks of that day - not only of the Lacedæmonians themselves , but of the other Greeks also . He when Pausanias was sacrificing was wounded in the side by an arrow ; and then they fought , but on being carried off he regretted his death , and said to Arimnestus , a Platæan , that he did not grieve at dying for Greece , but at not having struck a blow , or , although he desired so to do , performed any deed worthy of himself . "
4800	4921	4784	4784	He	118	" My marriage had diverted me from a project which I can not enter into now . I have no time , Holly - I have no time ! One day , if you accept my trust , you will learn all about it . After my wife 's death I turned my mind to it again . But first it was necessary , or , at least , I conceived that it was necessary , that I should attain to a perfect knowledge of Eastern dialects , especially Arabic . It was to facilitate my studies that I came here . Very soon , however , my disease developed itself , and now there is an end of me . "
4952	4994	4996	4996	he	347	" I have never seen my boy , Leo , since he was a tiny baby . I never could bear to see him , but they tell me that he is a quick and handsome child . In this envelope , "
5007	5051	4996	4996	he	347	" I have jotted down the course I wish followed in the boy 's education . It is a somewhat peculiar one . At any rate , I could not entrust it to a stranger . Once more , will you undertake it ? "
5052	5063	5064	5064	I	0	" I must first know what I am to undertake , "
5067	5126	5128	5128	he	348	" You are to undertake to have the boy , Leo , to live with you till he is twenty - five years of age - not to send him to school , remember . On his twenty - fifth birthday your guardianship will end , and you will then , with the keys that I give you now "
5134	5280	5417	5417	He	349	" open the iron box , and let him see and read the contents , and say whether or no he is willing to undertake the quest . There is no obligation on him to do so . Now , as regards terms . My present income is two thousand two hundred a year . Half of that income I have secured to you by will for life , contingently on your undertaking the guardianship - that is , one thousand a year remuneration to yourself , for you will have to give up your life to it , and one hundred a year to pay for the board of the boy . The rest is to accumulate till Leo is twenty - five , so that there may be a sum in hand should he wish to undertake the quest of which I spoke . "
5281	5289	5290	5290	I	0	" And suppose I were to die ? "
5293	5416	5417	5417	He	349	" Then the boy must become a ward of Chancery and take his chance . Only be careful that the iron chest is passed on to him by your will . Listen , Holly , do n't refuse me . Believe me , this is to your advantage . You are not fit to mix with the world - it would only embitter you . In a few weeks you will become a Fellow of your College , and the income that you will derive from that combined with what I have left you will enable you to live a life of learned leisure , alternated with the sport of which you are so fond , such as will exactly suit you . "
5437	5460	5417	5417	He	349	" For my sake , Holly . We have been good friends , and I have no time to make other arrangements . "
5461	5465	5466	5466	I	0	" Very well , "
5469	5489	5466	5466	I	0	" I will do it , provided there is nothing in this paper to make me change my mind , "
5505	5543	5466	5466	I	0	" Thank you , Holly , thank you . There is nothing at all . Swear to me by God that you will be a father to the boy , and follow my directions to the letter . "
5544	5549	5550	5550	I	0	" I swear it , "
5554	5626	5629	5629	he	349	" Very well , remember that perhaps one day I shall ask for the account of your oath , for though I am dead and forgotten , yet I shall live . There is no such thing as death , Holly , only a change , and , as you may perhaps learn in time to come , I believe that even that change could under certain circumstances be indefinitely postponed , "
5640	5643	5644	5644	he	349	" There , "
5647	5712	5644	5644	he	349	" I must go , you have the chest , and my will will be found among my papers , under the authority of which the child will be handed over to you . You will be well paid , Holly , and I know that you are honest , but if you betray my trust , by Heaven , I will haunt you . "
5755	5761	5762	5762	he	349	" Food for the worms , "
5765	5843	5762	5762	he	349	" Curious to think that in a few hours I shall be stiff and cold - the journey done , the little game played out . Ah me , Holly ! life is not worth the trouble of life , except when one is in love - at least , mine has not been ; but the boy Leo 's may be if he has the courage and the faith . Good - bye , my friend ! "
5870	5876	5877	5877	I	0	" Look here , Vincey , "
5880	5899	5877	5877	I	0	" if you are as ill as you think , you had better let me fetch a doctor . "
5900	5905	5906	5906	he	349	" No , no , "
5910	5937	5906	5906	he	349	" Promise me that you wo n't . I am going to die , and , like a poisoned rat , I wish to die alone . "
5938	5954	5955	5955	I	0	" I do n't believe that you are going to do anything of the sort , "
5966	5968	5958	5958	He	349	" Remember "

6399	6410	6387	6387	I	0	" You look as though you had seen a ghost ! "
6411	6421	6422	6422	he	358	" Yes , sir , and so I have , "
6425	6457	6422	6422	he	358	" leastways I 've seen a corpse , which is worse . I 've been in to call Mr. Vincey , as usual , and there he lies stark and dead ! "
7009	7273	6979	6980	a lawyer	364	" Sir , - Our client , the late M. L. Vincey , Esq . , who died on the 9th instant in - - College , Cambridge , has left behind him a Will , of which you will please find copy enclosed and of which we are the executors . Under this Will you will perceive that you take a life - interest in about half of the late Mr. Vincey 's property , now invested in Consols , subject to your acceptance of the guardianship of his only son , Leo Vincey , at present an infant , aged five . Had we not ourselves drawn up the document in question in obedience to Mr. Vincey 's clear and precise instructions , both personal and written , and had he not then assured us that he had very good reasons for what he was doing , we are bound to tell you that its provisions seem to us of so unusual a nature , that we should have bound to call the attention of the Court of Chancery to them , in order that such steps might be taken as seemed desirable to it , either by contesting the capacity of the testator or otherwise , to safeguard the interests of the infant . As it is , knowing that the testator was a gentleman of the highest intelligence and acumen , and that he has absolutely no relations living to whom he could have confided the guardianship of the child , we do not feel justified in taking this course .

10843	11100	10831	10831	he	108	" My Son Leo , - When you open this , if you ever live to do so , you will have attained to manhood , and I shall have been long enough dead to be absolutely forgotten by nearly all who knew me . Yet in reading it remember that I have been , and for anything you know may still be , and that in it , through this link of pen and paper , I stretch out my hand to you across the gulf of death , and my voice speaks to you from the silence of the grave . Though I am dead , and no memory of me remains in your mind , yet am I with you in this hour that you read . Since your birth to this day I have scarcely seen your face . Forgive me this . Your life supplanted the life of one whom I loved better than women are often loved , and the bitterness of it endureth yet . Had I lived I should in time have conquered this foolish feeling , but I am not destined to live . My sufferings , physical and mental , are more than I can bear , and when such small arrangements as I have to make for your future well - being are completed it is my intention to put a period to them . May God forgive me if I do wrong . At the best I could not live more than another year . "
11101	11107	11108	11108	I	0	" So he killed himself , "
11111	11116	11108	11108	I	0	" I thought so . "
11117	11121	11122	11122	Leo	108	" And now , "
11129	11491	11122	11122	Leo	108	" enough of myself . What has to be said belongs to you who live , not to me , who am dead , and almost as much forgotten as though I had never been . Holly , my friend to whom , if he will accept the trust , it is my intention to confide you , will have told you something of the extraordinary antiquity of your race . In the contents of this casket you will find sufficient to prove it . The strange legend that you will find inscribed by your remote ancestress upon the potsherd was communicated to me by my father on his deathbed , and took a strong hold in my imagination . When I was only nineteen years of age I determined , as , to his misfortune , did one of our ancestors about the time of Elizabeth , to investigate its truth . Into all that befell me I can not enter now . But this I saw with my own eyes . On the coast of Africa , in a hitherto unexplored region , some distance to the north of where the Zambesi falls into the sea , there is a headland , at the extremity of which a peak towers up , shaped like the head of a negro , similar to that of which the writing speaks . I landed there , and learnt from a wandering native , who had been cast out by his people because of some crime which he had committed , that far inland are great mountains , shaped like cups , and caves surrounded by measureless swamps . I learnt also that the people there speak a dialect of Arabic , and are ruled over by a beautiful white woman who is seldom seen by them , but who is reported to have power over all things living and dead . Two days after I had ascertained this the man died of fever contracted in crossing the swamps , and I was forced by want of provisions and by symptoms of an illness which afterwards prostrated me to take to my dhow again .
11492	11678	10831	10831	he	108	" Of the adventures that befell me after this I need not now speak . I was wrecked upon the coast of Madagascar , and rescued some months afterwards by an English ship that brought me to Aden , whence I started for England , intending to prosecute my search as soon as I had made sufficient preparations . On my way I stopped in Greece , and there , for ' Omnia vincit amor , ' I met your beloved mother , and married her , and there you were born and she died . Then it was that my last illness seized me , and I returned hither to die . But still I hoped against hope , and set myself to work to learn Arabic , with the intention , should I ever get better , of returning to the coast of Africa , and solving the mystery of which the tradition has lived so many centuries in our family . But I have not got better , and , so far as I am concerned , the story is at an end .
11679	11792	11122	11122	Leo	108	" For you , however , my son , it is not at an end , and to you I hand on these the results of my labour , together with the hereditary proofs of its origin . It is my intention to provide that they shall not be put into your hands until you have reached an age when you will be able to judge for yourself whether or no you will choose to investigate what , if it is true , must be the greatest mystery in the world , or to put it by as an idle fable , originating in the first place in a woman 's disordered brain .
11793	12111	10831	10831	he	108	" I do not believe that it is a fable ; I believe that if it can only be re - discovered there is a spot where the vital forces of the world visibly exist . Life exists ; why therefore should not the means of preserving it indefinitely exist also ? But I have no wish to prejudice your mind about the matter . Read and judge for yourself . If you are inclined to undertake the search , I have so provided that you will not lack for means . If , on the other hand , you are satisfied that the whole thing is a chimera , then , I adjure you , destroy the potsherd and the writings , and let a cause of troubling be removed from our race for ever . Perhaps that will be wisest . The unknown is generally taken to be terrible , not as the proverb would infer , from the inherent superstition of man , but because it so often is terrible . He who would tamper with the vast and secret forces that animate the world may well fall a victim to them . And if the end were attained , if at last you emerged from the trial ever beautiful and ever young , defying time and evil , and lifted above the natural decay of flesh and intellect , who shall say that the awesome change would prove a happy one ? Choose , my son , and may the Power who rules all things , and who says ' thus far shalt thou go , and thus much shalt thou learn , ' direct the choice to your own happiness and the happiness of the world , which , in the event of your success , you would one day certainly rule by the pure force of accumulated experience . - Farewell !

12202	12238	12197	12197	I	0	" I guessed as much that night , twenty years ago , when he came into my room . You see he evidently hurried his own end , poor man . It is absolute balderdash . "

12271	12288	12290	12290	Leo	108	" Well , let 's see what the potsherd has to say , at any rate , "
12308	12915	12290	12290	Leo	108	" I , Amenartas , of the Royal House of the Pharaohs of Egypt , wife of Kallikrates the Beautiful in Strength , a Priest of Isis whom the gods cherish and the demons obey , being about to die , to my little son Tisisthenes the Mighty Avenger . I fled with thy father from Egypt in the days of Nectanebes , causing him through love to break the vows that he had vowed . We fled southward , across the waters , and we wandered for twice twelve moons on the coast of Libya Africa that looks towards the rising sun , where by a river is a great rock carven like the head of an Ethiopian . Four days on the water from the mouth of a mighty river were we cast away , and some were drowned and some died of sickness . But us wild men took through wastes and marshes , where the sea fowl hid the sky , bearing us ten days ' journey till we came to a hollow mountain , where a great city had been and fallen , and where there are caves of which no man hath seen the end ; and they brought us to the Queen of the people who place pots upon the heads of strangers , who is a magician having a knowledge of all things , and life and loveliness that does not die . And she cast eyes of love upon thy father , Kallikrates , and would have slain me , and taken him to husband , but he loved me and feared her , and would not . Then did she take us , and lead us by terrible ways , by means of dark magic , to where the great pit is , in the mouth of which the old philosopher lay dead , and showed to us the rolling Pillar of Life that dies not , whereof the voice is as the voice of thunder ; and she did stand in the flames , and come forth unharmed , and yet more beautiful . Then did she swear to make thy father undying even as she is , if he would but slay me , and give himself to her , for me she could not slay because of the magic of my own people that I have , and that prevailed thus far against her . And he held his hand before his eyes to hide her beauty , and would not . Then in her rage did she smite him by her magic , and he died ; but she wept over him , and bore him thence with lamentations : and being afraid , me she sent to the mouth of the great river where the ships come , and I was carried far away on the ships where I gave thee birth , and hither to Athens I came at last after many wanderings . Now I say to thee , my son , Tisisthenes , seek out the woman , and learn the secret of Life , and if thou mayest find a way slay her , because of thy father Kallikrates ; and if thou dost fear or fail , this I say to all thy seed who come after thee , till at last a brave man be found among them who shall bathe in the fire and sit in the place of the Pharaohs . I speak of those things , that though they be past belief , yet I have known , and I lie not . "
12944	12953	12955	12955	Job	137	" May the Lord forgive her for that , "

17076	17204	17072	17072	his	512	" It is this . I believe that potsherd to be perfectly genuine , and that , wonderful as it may seem , it has come down in your family from since the fourth century before Christ . The entries absolutely prove it , and therefore , however improbable it may seem , it must be accepted . But there I stop . That your remote ancestress , the Egyptian princess , or some scribe under her direction , wrote that which we see on the sherd I have no doubt , nor have I the slightest doubt but that her sufferings and the loss of her husband had turned her head , and that she was not right in her mind when she did write it .

Also , I believe that there are lots of swamps . Another thing is , Leo , and I am sorry to say it , but I do not believe that your poor father was quite right when he wrote that letter . He had met with a great trouble , and also he had allowed this story to prey on his imagination , and he was a very imaginative man . Anyway , I believe that the whole thing is the most unmitigated rubbish . I know that there are curious things and forces in nature which we rarely meet with , and , when we do meet them , can not understand . But until I see it with my own eyes , which I am not likely to , I never will believe that there is any means of avoiding death , even for a time , or that there is or was a white sorceress living in the heart of an African swamp . It is bosh , my boy , all bosh ! - What do you say , Job ? "

44164	44236	44145	44145	I	0	" Yes , my son , it is I ; but let me not disturb thee . I did but come to see how thou didst fare , and to tell thee that those who would have slain thee , my Baboon , are by now far on their road to She . She said that ye also were to come at once , but I fear ye can not yet . "
44237	44240	44241	44241	I	0	" Nay , "
44244	44275	44241	44241	I	0	" not till we have recovered a little ; but have me borne out into the daylight , I pray thee , my father . I love not this place . "
44276	44281	44282	44282	he	1314	" Ah , no , "
44285	44710	44282	44282	he	1314	" it hath a sad air . I remember when I was a boy I found the body of a fair woman lying where thou liest now , yes , on that very bench . She was so beautiful that I was wo nt to creep in hither with a lamp and gaze upon her . Had it not been for her cold hands , almost could I think that she slept and would one day awake , so fair and peaceful was she in her robes of white . White was she , too , and her hair was yellow and lay down her almost to the feet . There are many such still in the tombs at the place where She is , for those who set them there had a way I know naught of , whereby to keep their beloved out of the crumbling hand of Decay , even when Death had slain them . Ay , day by day I came hither , and gazed on her till at last - laugh not at me , stranger , for I was but a silly lad - I learned to love that dead form , that shell which once had held a life that no more is . I would creep up to her and kiss her cold face , and wonder how many men had lived and died since she was , and who had loved her and embraced her in the days that long had passed away . And , my Baboon , I think I learned wisdom from that dead one , for of a truth it taught me of the littleness of life , and the length of Death , and how all things that are under the sun go down one path , and are for ever forgotten . And so I mused , and it seemed to me that wisdom flowed into me from the dead , till one day my mother , a watchful woman , but hasty - minded , seeing I was changed , followed me , and saw the beautiful white one , and feared that I was bewitched , as , indeed , I was . So half in dread , and half in anger , she took up the lamp , and standing the dead woman up against the wall even there , set fire to her hair , and she burnt fiercely , even down to the feet , for those who are thus kept burn excellently well .
44711	44729	44145	44145	I	0	" See , my son , there on the roof is yet the smoke of her burning . "
44795	44799	44800	44800	he	1316	" She burnt , "
44808	44898	44800	44800	he	1316	" even to the feet , but the feet I came back and saved , cutting the burnt bone from them , and hid them under the stone bench there , wrapped up in a piece of linen . Surely , I remember it as though it were but yesterday . Perchance they are there , if none have found them , even to this hour . Of a truth I have not entered this chamber from that time to this very day . Stay , I will look , "
44992	45002	45003	45003	he	1316	" Thou seest , my son , the Baboon , "
45011	45038	45003	45003	he	1316	" I spake the truth to thee , for here is yet one foot remaining . Take it , my son , and gaze upon it . "
45578	45670	45562	45562	Billali	137	K"r , which we were told was the name of the place where the mysterious She lived , though I still feared for its effect upon Leo , and especially lest the motion should cause his wound , which was scarcely skinned over , to break open again . Indeed , had it not been for Billali 's evident anxiety to get off , which led us to suspect that some difficulty or danger might threaten us if we did not comply with it , I would not have consented to go .
45769	45780	45781	45781	I	0	" Does the lady go with us , my father ? "
45802	45844	45794	45794	He	137	" If she wills . In this country the women do what they please . We worship them , and give them their way , because without them the world could not go on ; they are the source of life . "

45864	45869	45870	45870	he	137	" We worship them , "

45917	45920	45921	45921	he	137	" Then , "
45929	45999	45921	45921	he	137	" we rise , and kill the old ones as an example to the young ones , and to show them that we are the strongest . My poor wife was killed in that way three years ago . It was very sad , but to tell thee the truth , my son , life has been happier since , for my age protects me from the young ones . "

46089	46138	46139	46139	he	137	" I see it now , but all the ' responsibilities ' are killed , at least some of them are , and that is why there are so few old women about just now . Well , they brought it on themselves . As for this girl , "
46148	46209	46210	46210	he	137	" I know not what to say . She is a brave girl , and she loves the Lion Leo ; thou sawest how she clung to him , and saved his life . Also , she is , according to our custom , we d to him , and has a right to go where he goes , unless , "
46214	46228	46210	46210	he	137	" She would say her no , for her word overrides all rights . "

48970	48979	48980	48980	I	0	" Can they go on , my father ? "
48983	49072	48895	48895	he	137	" Nay , my son , they must go on . If they stop here they will certainly die ; also , they will be better in the litters than on the ground . By to - night , if all goes well , we shall be across the marsh and in good air . Come , let us lift them into the litters and start , for it is very bad to stand still in this morning fog . We can eat our meal as we go . "

51003	51186	50996	50996	his	137	" Thou art right , my son . It is a channel cut out by those who were before us in this place to carry away water . Of this I am sure : within the rocky circle of the mountain whither we journey was once a great lake . But those who were before us , by wonderful arts of which I know naught , hewed a path for the water through the solid rock of the mountain , piercing even to the bed of the lake . But first they cut the channel that thou seest across the plain . Then , when at last the water burst out , it rushed down the channel that had been made to receive it , and crossed this plain till it reached the low land behind the rise , and there , perchance , it made the swamp through which we have come . Then when the lake was drained dry , the people whereof I speak built a mighty city on its bed , whereof naught but ruins and the name of K"r

51296	51343	51275	51275	he	1469	" That is the drain , and it comes out through the mountain wall where this cutting goes in . At first , perhaps , the water ran down this canal , but afterwards the people turned it , and used the cutting for a road . "

60322	60332	60319	60319	she	1726	" I know not Herod . But go on . "
60333	60355	60171	60171	I	0	" The Romans burnt it , and the Roman eagles flew across its ruins , and now Judæa is a desert . "
60356	60402	60319	60319	she	1726	" So , so ! They were a great people , those Romans , and went straight to their end - ay , they sped to it like Fate , or like their own eagles on their prey ! - and left peace behind them . "
60403	60410	60411	60411	I	0	" Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant , "
60414	60426	60427	60427	she	1726	" Ah , thou canst speak the Latin tongue , too ! "
60433	60515	60427	60427	she	1726	" It hath a strange ring in my ears after all these days , and it seems to me that thy accent does not fall as the Romans put it . Who was it wrote that ? I know not the saying , but it is a true one of that great people . It seems that I have found a learned man - one whose hands have held the water of the world 's knowledge . Knowest thou Greek also ? "
60516	60541	60319	60319	she	1726	" Yes , oh Queen , and something of Hebrew , but not to speak them well . They are all dead languages now . "
60550	60571	60572	60572	she	1726	" Of a truth , ugly tree that thou art , thou growest the fruits of wisdom , oh Holly , "
60575	60612	60572	60572	she	1726	" but of those Jews whom I hated , for they called me ' heathen ' when I would have taught them my philosophy - did their Messiah come , and doth He rule the world ? "
60613	60618	60619	60619	I	0	" Their Messiah came , "
60624	60690	60619	60619	I	0	" but He came poor and lowly , and they would have none of Him . They scourged Him , and crucified Him upon a tree , but yet His words and His works live on , for He was the Son of God , and now of a truth He doth rule half the world , but not with an Empire of the World . "
60691	60700	60701	60701	she	1727	" Ah , the fierce - hearted wolves , "
60704	60970	60701	60701	she	1727	" the followers of Sense and many gods - greedy of gain and faction - torn . I can see their dark faces yet . So they crucified their Messiah ? Well can I believe it . That He was a Son of the Living Spirit would be naught to them , if indeed He was so , and of that we will talk afterwards . They would care naught for any God if He came not with pomp and power . They , a chosen people , a vessel of Him they call Jehovah , ay , and a vessel of Baal , and a vessel of Astoreth , and a vessel of the gods of the Egyptians - a high - stomached people , greedy of aught that brought them wealth and power . So they crucified their Messiah because He came in lowly guise - and now are they scattered about the earth ? Why , if I remember , so said one of their prophets that it should be . Well , let them go - they broke my heart , those Jews , and made me look with evil eyes across the world , ay , and drove me to this wilderness , this place of a people that was before them . When I would have taught them wisdom in Jerusalem they stoned me , ay , at the Gate of the Temple those white - bearded hypocrites and Rabbis hounded the people on to stone me ! See , here is the mark of it to this day ! "
61007	61014	61015	61015	I	0	" Pardon me , oh Queen , "
61018	61086	61015	61015	I	0	" but I am bewildered . Nigh upon two thousand years have rolled across the earth since the Jewish Messiah hung upon His cross at Golgotha . How then canst thou have taught thy philosophy to the Jews before He was ? Thou art a woman and no spirit . How can a woman live two thousand years ? Why dost thou befool me , oh Queen ? "
61111	61115	61116	61116	she	1729	" Oh man ! "
61127	61185	61187	61187	she	1729	" it seems that there are still things upon the earth of which thou knowest naught . Dost thou still believe that all things die , even as those very Jews believed ? I tell thee that naught dies . There is no such thing as Death , though there be a thing called Change . See , "
61197	61250	61252	61252	she	1729	" Three times two thousand years have passed since the last of the great race that hewed those pictures fell before the breath of the pestilence which destroyed them , yet are they not dead . E'en now they live ; perchance their spirits are drawn towards us at this very hour , "
61256	61272	61252	61252	she	1729	" Of a surety it sometimes seems to me that my eyes can see them . "
61273	61284	61187	61187	she	1729	" Yes , but to the world they are dead . "
61285	61485	61252	61252	she	1729	" Ay , for a time ; but even to the world are they born again and again . I , yes I , Ayesha - for that , stranger , is my name - I say to thee that I wait now for one I loved to be born again , and here I tarry till he finds me , knowing of a surety that hither he will come , and that here , and here only , shall he greet me . Why , dost thou believe that I , who am all - powerful , I , whose loveliness is more than the loveliness of the Grecian Helen , of whom they used to sing , and whose wisdom is wider , ay , far more wide and deep than the wisdom of Solomon the Wise - I , who know the secrets of the earth and its riches , and can turn all things to my uses - I , who have even for a while overcome Change , that ye call Death - why , I say , oh stranger , dost thou think that I herd here with barbarians lower than the beasts ? "
61493	61498	61499	61499	I	0	" I know not , "
61503	61734	61252	61252	she	1729	" Because I wait for him I love . My life has perchance been evil , I know not - for who can say what is evil and what good ? - so I fear to die even if I could die , which I can not until mine hour comes , to go and seek him where he is ; for between us there might rise a wall I could not climb , at least , I dread it . Surely easy would it be also to lose the way in seeking in those great spaces wherein the planets wander on for ever . But the day will come , it may be when five thousand more years have passed , and are lost and melted into the vault of Time , even as the little clouds melt into the gloom of night , or it may be to - morrow , when he , my love , shall be born again , and then , following a law that is stronger than any human plan , he shall find me here , where once he knew me , and of a surety his heart will soften towards me , though I sinned against him ; ay , even though he knew me not again , yet will he love me , if only for my beauty 's sake . "
61758	61766	61767	61767	I	0	" But even so , oh Queen , "
61772	61795	61767	61767	I	0	" even if we men be born again and again , that is not so with thee , if thou speakest truly . "
61814	61817	61797	61797	she	1730	" thou , "
61823	61829	61818	61818	I	0	" who hast never died ? "
61830	61835	61836	61836	she	1730	" That is so , "
61839	62190	61836	61836	she	1730	" and it is so because I have , half by chance and half by learning , solved one of the great secrets of the world . Tell me , stranger : life is - why therefore should not life be lengthened for a while ? What are ten or twenty or fifty thousand years in the history of life ? Why in ten thousand years scarce will the rain and storms lessen a mountain top by a span in thickness ? In two thousand years these caves have not changed , nothing has changed but the beasts , and man , who is as the beasts . There is naught that is wonderful about the matter , couldst thou but understand . Life is wonderful , ay , but that it should be a little lengthened is not wonderful . Nature hath her animating spirit as well as man , who is Nature 's child , and he who can find that spirit , and let it breathe upon him , shall live with her life . He shall not live eternally , for Nature is not eternal , and she herself must die , even as the nature of the moon hath died . She herself must die , I say , or rather change and sleep till it be time for her to live again . But when shall she die ? Not yet , I ween , and while she lives , so shall he who hath all her secret live with her . All I have it not , yet have I some , more perchance than any who were before me . Now , to thee I doubt not that this thing is a great mystery , therefore I will not overcome thee with it now . Another time I will tell thee more if the mood be on me , though perchance I shall never speak thereof again . Dost thou wonder how I knew that ye were coming to this land , and so saved your heads from the hot - pot ? "
62191	62197	62198	62198	I	0	" Ay , oh Queen , "
62202	62209	62211	62211	she	1731	" Then gaze upon that water , "
62348	62356	62357	62357	she	1731	" Nay , nay ; oh Holly , "
62360	62649	62357	62357	she	1731	" it is no magic , that is a fiction of ignorance . There is no such thing as magic , though there is such a thing as a knowledge of the secrets of Nature . That water is my glass ; in it I see what passes if I will to summon up the pictures , which is not often . Therein I can show thee what thou wilt of the past , if it be anything that hath to do with this country and with what I have known , or anything that thou , the gazer , hast known . Think of a face if thou wilt , and it shall be reflected from thy mind upon the water . I know not all the secret yet - I can read nothing in the future . But it is an old secret ; I did not find it . In Arabia and in Egypt the sorcerers knew it centuries gone . So one day I chanced to bethink me of that old canal - some twenty ages since I sailed upon it , and I was minded to look thereon again . So I looked , and there I saw the boat and three men walking , and one , whose face I could not see , but a youth of noble form , sleeping in the boat , and so I sent and saved ye . And now farewell . But stay , tell me of this youth - the Lion , as the old man calls him . I would look upon him , but he is sick , thou sayest - sick with the fever , and also wounded in the fray . "
62650	62656	62657	62657	I	0	" He is very sick , "
62661	62677	62657	62657	I	0	" canst thou do nothing for him , oh Queen ! who knowest so much ? "
62678	62709	62357	62357	she	1731	" Of a surety I can . I can cure him ; but why speakest thou so sadly ? Dost thou love the youth ? Is he perchance thy son ? "
62710	62728	62657	62657	I	0	" He is my adopted son , oh Queen ! Shall he be brought in before thee ? "
62729	62740	62357	62357	she	1731	" Nay . How long hath the fever taken him ? "
62741	62748	62657	62657	I	0	" This is the third day . "
62749	62841	62357	62357	she	1731	" Good ; then let him lie another day . Then will he perchance throw it off by his own strength , and that is better than that I should cure him , for my medicine is of a sort to shake the life in its very citadel . If , however , by to - morrow night , at that hour when the fever first took him , he doth not begin to mend , then will I come to him and cure him . Stay , who nurses him ? "
62842	62856	62859	62859	I	0	" Our white servant , him whom Billali names the Pig ; also , "
62866	62912	62859	62859	I	0	" a woman named Ustane , a very handsome woman of this country , who came and embraced him when she first saw him , and hath stayed by him ever since , as I understand is the fashion of thy people , oh Queen . "

62930	63045	62926	62926	she	1736	" these slaves are no people of mine , they are but dogs to do my bidding till the day of my deliverance comes ; and , as for their customs , naught have I to do with them . Also , call me not Queen - I am weary of flattery and titles - call me Ayesha , the name hath a sweet sound in mine ears , it is an echo from the past . As for this Ustane , I know not . I wonder if it be she against whom I was warned , and whom I in turn did warn ? Hath she - stay , I will see ; "
63066	63069	63070	63070	she	1737	" See , "
63074	63080	63070	63070	she	1737	" is that the woman ? "

63183	63210	63211	63211	she	1737	" why , that is ' lion ' in the Latin tongue . The old man hath named happily for once . It is very strange , "
63219	63231	63211	63211	she	1737	" very . So like - but it is not possible ! "
63284	63298	63299	63299	she	1737	" Hast thou aught to ask me before thou goest , oh Holly ? "
63309	63349	63351	63351	she	1737	" It is but a rude life that thou must live here , for these people are savages , and know not the ways of cultivated man . Not that I am troubled thereby , for behold my food , "
63361	63510	63351	63351	she	1737	" Naught but fruit doth ever pass my lips - fruit and cakes of flour , and a little water . I have bidden my girls to wait upon thee . They are mutes , thou knowest , deaf are they and dumb , and therefore the safest of servants , save to those who can read their faces and their signs . I bred them so - it hath taken many centuries and much trouble ; but at last I have triumphed . Once I succeeded before , but the race was too ugly , so I let it die away ; but now , as thou seest , they are otherwise . Once , too , I reared a race of giants , but after a while Nature would no more of it , and it died away . Hast thou aught to ask of me ? "
63511	63520	63521	63521	I	0	" Ay , one thing , oh Ayesha , "
63538	63546	63535	63535	I	0	" I would gaze upon thy face . "
63557	63563	63564	63564	she	1740	" Bethink thee , Holly , "
63567	63652	63564	63564	she	1740	" bethink thee . It seems that thou knowest the old myths of the gods of Greece . Was there not one Actæon who perished miserably because he looked on too much beauty ? If I show thee my face , perchance thou wouldst perish miserably also ; perchance thou wouldst eat out thy heart in impotent desire ; for know I am not for thee - I am for no man , save one , who hath been , but is not yet . "
63653	63660	63661	63661	I	0	" As thou wilt , Ayesha , "
63664	63691	63661	63661	I	0	" I fear not thy beauty . I have put my heart away from such vanity as woman 's loveliness , that passeth like a flower . "
63692	63698	63699	63699	she	1741	" Nay , thou errest , "
63702	63803	63699	63699	she	1741	" that does not pass . My beauty endures even as I endure ; still , if thou wilt , oh rash man , have thy will ; but blame not me if passion mount thy reason , as the Egyptian breakers used to mount a colt , and guide it whither thou wilt not . Never may the man to whom my beauty has been unveiled put it from his mind , and therefore even with these savages do I go veiled , lest they vex me , and I should slay them . Say , wilt thou see ? "
63804	63808	63809	63809	I	0	" I will , "
64332	64391	64440	64440	her	1742	" Behold me , lovely as no woman was or is , undying and half - divine ; memory haunts me from age to age , and passion leads me by the hand - evil have I done , and from age to age evil I shall do , and sorrow shall I know till my redemption comes . "
64461	64465	64466	64466	she	1742	" Rash man ! "
64469	64540	64466	64466	she	1742	" like Actæon , thou hast had thy will ; be careful lest , like Actæon , thou too dost perish miserably , torn to pieces by the ban - hounds of thine own passions . I too , oh Holly , am a virgin goddess , not to be moved of any man , save one , and it is not thou . Say , hast thou seen enough ! "
64541	64553	64554	64554	I	0	" I have looked on beauty , and I am blinded , "
64567	64596	64599	64599	she	1742	" So ! what did I tell thee ? Beauty is like the lightning ; it is lovely , but it destroys - especially trees , oh Holly ! "

64688	64716	64718	64718	she	1742	" Man , whence hadst thou that scarab on thy hand ? Speak , or by the Spirit of Life I will blast thee where thou standest ! "
64766	64769	64770	64770	she	1742	" Peace , "
64788	64850	64770	64770	she	1742	" I did affright thee ! Forgive me ! But at times , oh Holly , the almost infinite mind grows impatient of the slowness of the very finite , and am I tempted to use my power out of vexation - very nearly wast thou dead , but I remembered - - . But the scarab - about the scarabæus ! "
64851	64857	64858	64858	I	0	" I picked it up , "
64907	64913	64914	64914	she	1742	" It is very strange , "
64935	64958	64914	64914	she	1742	" but once I knew a scarab like to that . It - hung round the neck - of one I loved , "
64987	64990	64991	64991	she	1742	" There , "
64995	65075	64991	64991	she	1742	" it must be one like to it , and yet never did I see one like to it , for thereto hung a history , and he who wore it prized it much . But the scarab that I knew was not set thus in the bezel of a ring . Go now , Holly , go , and , if thou canst , try to forget that thou hast of thy folly looked upon Ayesha 's beauty , "
65120	65125	65127	65127	he	1753	" Suten se Ra , "

67870	67883	67939	67939	She	3243	" Curse her memory - accursed be the memory of the Egyptian . "
67891	67905	68072	68072	she	3243	" Curse her , the daughter of the Nile , because of her beauty .
67906	67917	68072	68072	she	3243	" Curse her , because her magic hath prevailed against me .
67918	67930	68072	68072	she	3243	" Curse her , because she held my beloved from me . "
67957	67974	67939	67939	She	3243	" What is the use of cursing ? - she prevailed , and she is gone . "
67986	68005	67976	67976	she	3243	" Curse her where she is . Let my curses reach her where she is and disturb her rest .
68006	68019	67976	67976	she	3243	" Curse her through the starry spaces . Let her shadow be accursed .

68119	68134	68113	68113	she	3243	" Curse her when she shall be born again . Let her be born accursed .
68135	68151	68113	68113	she	3243	" Let her be utterly accused from the hour of her birth until sleep finds her .
68152	68177	68113	68113	she	3243	" Yea , then , let her be accursed ; for then shall I overtake her with my vengeance , and utterly destroy her . "
68296	68301	68302	68302	she	3243	" Two thousand years , "
68305	68411	68302	68302	she	3243	" two thousand years have I wanted and endured ; but though century doth still creep on to century , and time give place to time , the sting of memory hath not lessened , the light of hope doth not shine more bright . Oh ! to have lived two thousand years , with all my passion eating out my heart , and with my sin ever before me . Oh , that for me life can not bring forgetfulness ! Oh , for the weary years that have been and are yet to come , and evermore to come , endless and without end !
68412	68540	68542	68542	she	1836	" My love ! my love ! my love ! Why did that stranger bring thee back to me after this sort ? For five hundred years I have not suffered thus . Oh , if I sinned against thee , have I not wiped away the sin ? When wilt thou come back to me who have all , and yet without thee have naught ? What is there that I can do ? What ? What ? What ? And perchance she - perchance that Egyptian doth abide with thee where thou art , and mock my memory . Oh , why could I not die with thee , I who slew thee ? Alas , that I can not die ! Alas ! Alas ! "
68596	68600	68601	68601	she	1836	" Oh Kallikrates , "
68611	68644	68605	68605	I	0	" I must look upon thy face again , though it be agony . It is a generation since I looked upon thee whom I slew - slew with mine own hand , "

I shrank in horror behind the curtain , my hair stood up upon my head , and , whether it was my imagination or a fact I am unable to say , but I thought that the quiet form beneath the covering began to quiver , and the winding sheet to lift as though it lay on the breast of one who slept . Suddenly she withdrew her hands , and the motion of the corpse seemed to me to cease .
68842	68847	68848	68848	she	1836	" To what purpose ? "
68852	68909	68848	68848	she	1836	" Of what good is it to recall the semblance of life when I can not recall the spirit ? Even if thou stoodest before me thou wouldst not know me , and couldst but do what I bid thee . The life in thee would be my life , and not thy life , Kallikrates . "

If he do n't soon mend , he 'll end , sir ; and that 's all about it ; though I must say that that there savage , Ustane , do do her best for him , almost like a baptised Christian . She is always hanging round and looking after him , and if I ventures to interfere it 's awful to see her ; her hair seems to stand on end , and she curses and swears away in her heathen talk - at least I fancy she must be cursing , from the look of her . "
69649	69657	69455	69455	he	137	" And what do you do then ? "
69658	69834	69835	69835	Job	137	" I make her a perlite bow , and I say , ' Young woman , your position is one that I do n't quite understand , and ca n't recognise . Let me tell you that I has a duty to perform to my master as is incapacitated by illness , and that I am going to perform it until I am incapacitated too , ' but she do n't take no heed , not she - only curses and swears away worse than ever . Last night she put her hand under that sort of night - shirt she wears and whips out a knife with a kind of a curl in the blade , so I whips out my revolver , and we walks round and round each other till at last she bursts out laughing . It is n't nice treatment for a Christian man to have to put up with from a savage , however handsome she may be , but it is what people must expect as is fools enough "

69844	69966	69835	69835	Job	137	" to come to such a place to look for things no man is meant to find . It 's a judgment on us , sir - that 's my view ; and I , for one , is of opinion that the judgment is n't half done yet , and when it is done we shall be done too , and just stop in these beastly caves with the ghosts and the corpseses for once and all . And now , sir , I must be seeing about Mr. Leo 's broth , if that wild cat will let me ; and , perhaps , you would like to get up , sir , because it 's past nine o'clock . "

First , ye have attacked these strangers , being white men , and would have slain their servant , and for that alone death is your reward . But that is not all . Ye have dared to disobey me . Did I not send my word unto you by Billali , my servant , and the father of your household ? Did I not bid you to hospitably entertain these strangers , whom now ye have striven to slay , and whom , had not they been brave and strong beyond the strength of men , ye would cruelly have murdered ? Hath it not been taught to you from childhood that the law of She is an ever fixed law , and that he who breaketh it by so much as one jot or tittle shall perish ? And is not my lightest word a law ? Have not your fathers taught you this , I say , whilst as yet ye were but children ? Do ye not know that as well might ye bid these great caves to fall upon you , or the sun to cease its journeying , as to hope to turn me from my courses , or make my word light or heavy , according to your minds ? Well do ye know it , ye Wicked Ones . But ye are all evil - evil to the core - the wickedness bubbles up in you like a fountain in the spring - time . Were it not for me , generations since had ye ceased to be , for of your own evil way had ye destroyed each other . And now , because ye have done this thing , because ye have striven to put these men , my guests , to death , and yet more because ye have dared to disobey my word , this is the doom that I doom you to . That ye be taken to the cave of torture , and given over to the tormentors , and that on the going down of to - morrow 's sun those of you who yet remain alive be slain , even as ye would have slain the servant of this my guest .

72748	72871	72872	72872	She	1935	K"r . The only objects in the cave itself were slabs of rock arranged in various positions to facilitate the operations of the torturers . Many of these slabs , which were of a porous stone , were stained quite dark with the blood of ancient victims that had soaked into them . Also in the centre of the room was a place for a furnace , with a cavity wherein to heat the historic pot . But the most dreadful thing about the cave was that over each slab was a sculptured illustration of the appropriate torture being applied . These sculptures were so awful that I will not harrow the reader by attempting a description of them . - L. H. H.

They are tigers to lap blood , and even now they hunger for your lives . How thinkest thou that I rule this people ? I have but a regiment of guards to do my bidding , therefore it is not by force . It is by terror . My empire is of the imagination . Once in a generation mayhap I do as I have done but now , and slay a score by torture . Believe not that I would be cruel , or take vengeance on anything so low . What can it profit me to be avenged on such as these ? Those who live long , my Holly , have no passions , save where they have interests . Though I may seem to slay in wrath , or because my mood is crossed , it is not so . Thou hast seen how in the heavens the little clouds blow this way and that without a cause , yet behind them is the great wind sweeping on its path whither it listeth . So it is with me , oh Holly . My moods and changes are the little clouds , and fitfully these seem to turn ; but behind them ever blows the great wind of my purpose . Nay , the men must die ; and die as I have said . "

And now , follow thou me , and I will show thee after what fashion this great people fell when the time was come for it to fall , "
74276	74280	74281	74281	she	1972	" Thou seest , "
74284	74292	74281	74281	she	1972	" Tell me , what is it ? "

74355	74383	74305	74305	she	1972	K"r . This inscription she proceeded to translate to me , the pigment still being fresh enough to show the form of the letters . It ran thus :

Then , at last , a remnant of this the great people , the light of the whole world , went down to the coast and took ship and sailed northwards ; and now am I , the Priest Junis , who write this , the last man left alive of this great city of men , but whether there be any yet left in the other cities I know not . This do I write in misery of heart before I die , because K"r

74962	75035	74916	74916	her	114	" Old ? Yes , it is old indeed . Time after time have nations , ay , and rich and strong nations , learned in the arts , been and passed away and been forgotten , so that no memory of them remains . This is but one of several ; for Time eats up the works of man , unless , indeed , he digs in caves like the people of K"r

They conquered till none were left to conquer , and then they dwelt at ease within their rocky mountain walls , with their man servants and their maid servants , their minstrels , their sculptors , and their concubines , and traded and quarrelled , and ate and hunted and slept and made merry till their time came . But come , I will show thee the great pit beneath the cave whereof the writing speaks . Never shall thine eyes witness such another sight . "

76320	76483	76484	76484	We	2057	K"r , where this winsome lady girt about with beauty had lived and died , and dying taken her last - born with her to the tomb . There they were before us , mother and babe , the white memories of a forgotten human history speaking more eloquently to the heart than could any written record of their lives . Reverently I replaced the grave - cloths , and , with a sigh that flowers so fair should , in the purpose of the Everlasting , have only bloomed to be gathered to the grave , I turned to the body on the opposite shelf , and gently unveiled it . It was that of a man in advanced life , with a long grizzled beard , and also robed in white , probably the husband of the lady , who , after surviving her many years , came at the last to sleep once more for good and all beside her .
76883	76964	76880	76883	the people of K"r	4011	K"r there was a law , which Ayesha showed me alluded to on some of the inscriptions , to the effect that on pain of heavy penalties no one under a certain rank was to be embalmed with the drugs prepared from the roots . The object and effect of this was , of course , to preserve the trees from extermination . The sale of the leaves and roots was a Government monopoly , and from it the Kings of K"r

77668	78007	77638	77638	she	2083	" to the tomb , and to the forgetfulness that hides the tomb , must we all come at last ! Ay , even I who live so long . Even for me , oh Holly , thousands upon thousands of years hence ; thousands of years after you hast gone through the gate and been lost in the mists , a day will dawn whereon I shall die , and be even as thou art and these are . And then what will it avail that I have lived a little longer , holding off death by the knowledge that I have wrung from Nature , since at last I too must die ? What is a span of ten thousand years , or ten times ten thousand years , in the history of time ? It is as naught - it is as the mists that roll up in the sunlight ; it fleeth away like an hour of sleep or a breath of the Eternal Spirit . Behold the lot of man ! Certainly it shall overtake us , and we shall sleep . Certainly , too , we shall awake and live again , and again shall sleep , and so on and on , through periods , spaces , and times , from æon unto æon , till the world is dead , and the worlds beyond the world are dead , and naught liveth but the Spirit that is Life . But for us twain and for these dead ones shall the end of ends be Life , or shall it be Death ? As yet Death is but Life 's Night , but out of the night is the Morrow born again , and doth again beget the Night . Only when Day and Night , and Life and Death , are ended and swallowed up in that from which they came , what shall be our fate , oh Holly ? Who can see so far ? Not even I ! "
78020	78067	77638	77638	she	2083	" Hast thou seen enough , my stranger guest , or shall I show thee more of the wonders of these tombs that are my palace halls ? If thou wilt , I can lead thee to where Tisno , the mightiest and most valorous King of K"r

78253	78526	78250	78250	she	2096	" enter with me , oh Holly , for of a truth thy conversation pleaseth me . Think , oh Holly : for two thousand years have I had none to converse with save slaves and my own thoughts , and though of all this thinking hath much wisdom come , and many secrets been made plain , yet am I weary of my thoughts , and have come to loathe mine own society , for surely the food that memory gives to eat is bitter to the taste , and it is only with the teeth of hope that we can bear to bite it . Now , though thy thoughts are green and tender , as becometh one so young , yet are they those of a thinking brain , and in truth thou dost bring back to my mind certain of those old philosophers with whom in days bygone I have disputed at Athens , and at Becca in Arabia , for thou hast the same crabbed air and dusty look , as though thou hadst passed thy days in reading ill - writ Greek , and been stained dark with the grime of manuscripts . So draw the curtain , and sit here by my side , and we will eat fruit , and talk of pleasant things . See , I will again unveil to thee . Thou hast brought it on thyself , oh Holly ; fairly have I warned thee - and thou shalt call me beautiful as even those old philosophers were wo nt to do . Fie upon them , forgetting their philosophy ! "
78854	79126	79127	79127	I	0	" So , my Holly , sit there where thou canst see me . It is by thine own wish , remember - again I say , blame me not if thou dost wear away thy little span with such a sick pain at the heart that thou wouldst fain have died before ever thy curious eyes were set upon me . There , sit so , and tell me , for in truth I am inclined for praises - tell me , am I not beautiful ? Nay , speak not so hastily ; consider well the point ; take me feature by feature , forgetting not my form , and my hands and feet , and my hair , and the whiteness of my skin , and then tell me truly , hast thou ever known a woman who in aught , ay , in one little portion of her beauty , in the curve of an eyelash even , or the modelling of a shell - like ear , is justified to hold a light before my loveliness ? Now , my waist ! Perchance thou thinkest it too large , but of a truth it is not so ; it is this golden snake that is too large , and doth not bind it as it should . It is a wide snake , and knoweth that it is ill to tie in the waist . But see , give me thy hands - so - now press them round me , and there , with but a little force , thy fingers touch , oh Holly .

79260	79269	79270	79270	she	2105	" Oh , so soon , oh Holly ! "

I have not seen a man kneel before me for so many days , and , believe me , to a woman 's heart the sight is sweet , ay , wisdom and length of days take not from that dear pleasure which is our sex 's only right .
79339	79427	79429	79429	she	2110	" What wouldst thou ? - what wouldst thou ? Thou dost not know what thou doest . Have I not told thee that I am not for thee ? I love but one , and thou art not the man . Ah Holly , for all thy wisdom - and in a way thou art wise - thou art but a fool running after folly . Thou wouldst look into mine eyes - thou wouldst kiss me ! Well , if it pleaseth thee , look , "
79446	79504	79506	79506	she	2110	" ay , and kiss too , if thou wilt , for , thanks be given to the scheme of things , kisses leave no marks , except upon the heart . But if thou dost kiss , I tell thee of a surety wilt thou eat out thy breast with love of me , and die ! "
79603	79610	79611	79611	she	2110	" Enough of this wanton folly , "
79619	79838	79611	79611	she	2110	" Listen , Holly . Thou art a good and honest man , and I fain would spare thee ; but , oh ! it is so hard for woman to be merciful . I have said I am not for thee , therefore let thy thoughts pass by me like an idle wind , and the dust of thy imagination sink again into the depths - well , of despair , if thou wilt . Thou dost not know me , Holly . Hadst thou seen me but ten hours past when my passion seized me , thou hadst shrunk from me in fear and trembling . I am of many moods , and , like the water in that vessel , I reflect many things ; but they pass , my Holly ; they pass , and are forgotten . Only the water is the water still , and I still am I , and that which maketh the water maketh it , and that which maketh me maketh me , nor can my quality be altered . Therefore , pay no heed to what I seem , seeing that thou canst not know what I am . If thou troublest me again I will veil myself , and thou shalt behold my face no more . "
79913	79916	79917	79917	she	2111	" So , "
79921	80029	79917	79917	she	2111	" now eat some fruit ; believe me , it is the only true food for man . Oh , tell me of the philosophy of that Hebrew Messiah , who came after me , and who thou sayest doth now rule Rome , and Greece , and Egypt , and the barbarians beyond . It must have been a strange philosophy that He taught , for in my day the peoples would have naught of our philosophies . Revel and lust and drink , blood and cold steel , and the shock of men gathered in the battle - these were the canons of their creeds . "
80141	80144	80145	80145	she	2113	" Ah ! "

To begin with , my mind was too weary with all the emotions through which I had passed , and , in the second place , I knew that I should get the worst of it . It is weary work enough to argue with an ordinary materialist , who hurls statistics and whole strata of geological facts at your head , whilst you can only buffet him with deductions and instincts and the snowflakes of faith , that are , alas ! so apt to melt in the hot embers of our troubles . How little chance , then , should I have against one whose brain was supernaturally sharpened , and who had two thousand years of experience , besides all manner of knowledge of the secrets of Nature at her command ! Feeling that she would be more likely to convert me than I should to convert her , I thought it best to leave the matter alone , and so sat silent . Many a time since then have I bitterly regretted that I did so , for thereby I lost the only opportunity I can remember having had of ascertaining what Ayesha really believed , and what her "
80678	80680	80422	80422	her	3913	" was .
80681	80687	80688	80688	she	2132	" Well , my Holly , "
80691	81101	80688	80688	she	2132	" and so those people of mine have found a prophet , a false prophet thou sayest , for he is not thine own , and , indeed , I doubt it not . Yet in my day was it otherwise , for then we Arabs had many gods . Allât there was , and Saba , the Host of Heaven , Al Uzza , and Manah the stony one , for whom the blood of victims flowed , and Wadd and Sawâ , and Yagh - th the Lion of the dwellers in Yaman , and Yä - k the Horse of Morad , and Nasr the Eagle of Hamyar ; ay , and many more . Oh , the folly of it all , the shame and the pitiful folly ! Yet when I rose in wisdom and spoke thereof , surely they would have slain me in the name of their outraged gods . Well , so hath it ever been ; - but , my Holly , art thou weary of me already , that thou dost sit so silent ? Or dost thou fear lest I should teach thee my philosophy ? - for know I have a philosophy . What would a teacher be without her own philosophy ? and if thou dost vex me overmuch beware ! for I will have thee learn it , and thou shalt be my disciple , and we twain will found a faith that shall swallow up all others . Faithless man ! And but half an hour since thou wast upon thy knees - the posture does not suit thee , Holly - swearing that thou didst love me . What shall we do ? - Nay , I have it . I will come and see this youth , the Lion , as the old man Billali calls him , who came with thee , and who is so sick . The fever must have run its course by now , and if he is about to die I will recover him . Fear not , my Holly , I shall use no magic . Have I not told thee that there is no such thing as magic , though there is such a thing as understanding and applying the forces which are in Nature ? Go now , and presently , when I have made the drug ready , I will follow thee . "
81519	81528	81529	81529	he	137	" Oh , God help us , sir ! "
81536	81549	81529	81529	he	137	" here 's a corpse a - coming sliding down the passage ! "
81645	81650	81658	81658	his	137	" Here it comes ! "
81681	81691	81692	81692	I	0	" Thou comest in a good time , Ayesha , "
81695	81706	81692	81692	I	0	" for my boy lies at the point of death . "
81707	81710	81711	81711	she	114	" So , "
81715	81760	81711	81711	she	114	" provided he be not dead , it is no matter , for I can bring him back to life , my Holly . Is that man there thy servant , and is that the method wherewith thy servants greet strangers in thy country ? "
81761	81777	81778	81778	I	0	" He is frightened of thy garb - it hath a death - like air , "
81784	81836	81711	81711	she	114	" And the girl ? Ah , I see now . It is she of whom thou didst speak to me . Well , bid them both to leave us , and we will see to this sick Lion of thine . I love not that underlings should perceive my wisdom . "
81886	81892	81893	81893	she	2150	" What does She want ? "
81912	81942	81893	81893	she	2150	" It is surely the right of a wife to be near her husband when he dieth . Nay , I will not go , my lord the Baboon . "
81943	81955	81957	81957	Ayesha	114	" Why doth not that woman leave us , my Holly ? "
81981	81990	81991	81991	I	0	" She is not willing to leave Leo , "
82037	82040	82000	82000	Ayesha	114	" Go ! "
82056	82063	82065	82065	Ayesha	114	" Thou seest , my Holly , "
82072	82123	82125	82125	she	114	" it was needful that I should give these people a lesson in obedience . That girl went nigh to disobeying me , but then she did not learn this morn how I treat the disobedient . Well , she has gone ; and now let me see the youth , "
82147	82154	82155	82155	she	114	" He hath a noble shape , "
82225	82232	82233	82233	I	0	" What is it , Ayesha ? "
82236	82241	82233	82233	I	0	" Is he dead ? "
82253	82257	82258	82258	she	114	" Thou dog ! "
82275	82284	82258	82258	she	114	" why didst thou hide this from me ? "
82303	82306	82307	82307	I	0	" What ? "
82316	82319	82307	82307	I	0	" what ? "
82320	82323	82324	82324	she	114	" Ah ! "
82327	82373	82375	82375	she	114	" perchance thou didst not know . Learn , my Holly , learn : there lies - there lies my lost Kallikrates . Kallikrates , who has come back to me at last , as I knew he would , as I knew he would ; "
82399	82404	82387	82387	herself	114	" Kallikrates , Kallikrates ! "
82405	82408	82410	82410	I	0	" Nonsense , "
82459	82463	82457	82457	she	114	" carrying on . "
82464	82475	82476	82476	I	0	" Unless thou art able to help him , Ayesha , "
82486	82503	82476	82476	I	0	" thy Kallikrates will soon be far beyond thy calling . Surely he dieth even now . "
82504	82507	82508	82508	she	114	" True , "
82515	82552	82554	82554	she	114	" Oh , why did I not come before ! I am unnerved - my hand trembles , even mine - and yet it is very easy . Here , thou Holly , take this phial , "
82568	82599	82554	82554	she	114	" and pour the liquid in it down his throat . It will cure him if he be not dead . Swift , now ! Swift ! The man dies ! "
83049	83055	83056	83056	I	0	" Is it too late ? "
83129	83133	83134	83134	I	0	" Thou seest , "
83140	83144	83145	83145	she	114	" I see , "
83149	83175	83145	83145	she	114	" He is saved . I thought we were too late - another moment - one little moment more - and he had been gone ! "
83210	83223	83224	83224	she	114	" Forgive me , my Holly - forgive me for my weakness , "
83227	83448	83224	83224	she	114	" Thou seest after all I am a very woman . Think - now think of it ! This morning didst thou speak of the place of torment appointed by this new religion of thine . Hell or Hades thou didst call it - a place where the vital essence lives and retains an individual memory , and where all the errors and faults of judgment , and unsatisfied passions and the unsubstantial terrors of the mind wherewith it hath at any time had to do , come to mock and haunt and gibe and wring the heart for ever and for ever with the vision of its own hopelessness . Thus , even thus , have I lived for full two thousand years - for some six and sixty generations , as ye reckon time - in a Hell , as thou callest it - tormented by the memory of a crime , tortured day and night with an unfulfilled desire - without companionship , without comfort , without death , and led on only down my dreary road by the marsh lights of Hope , which , though they flickered here and there , and now glowed strong , and now were not , yet , as my skill told me , would one day lead unto my deliverer .
83449	83882	83883	83883	She	2162	" And then - think of it still , oh Holly , for never shalt thou hear such another tale , or see such another scene , nay , not even if I give thee ten thousand years of life - and thou shalt have it in payment if thou wilt - think : at last my deliverer came - he for whom I had watched and waited through the generations - at the appointed time he came to seek me , as I knew that he must come , for my wisdom could not err , though I knew not when or how . Yet see how ignorant I was ! See how small my knowledge , and how faint my strength ! For hours he lay there sick unto death , and I felt it not - I who had waited for him for two thousand years - I knew it not . And then at last I see him , and behold , my chance is gone but by a hair 's breadth even before I have it , for he is in the very jaws of death , whence no power of mine can draw him . And if he die , surely must the Hell be lived through once more - once more must I face the weary centuries , and wait , and wait till the time in its fulness shall bring my Beloved back to me . And then thou gavest him the medicine , and that five minutes dragged long before I knew if he would live or die , and I tell thee that all the sixty generations that are gone were not so long as that five minutes . But they passed at length , and still he showed no sign , and I knew that if the drug works not then , so far as I have had knowledge , it works not at all . Then thought I that he was once more dead , and all the tortures of all the years gathered themselves into a single venomed spear , and pierced me through and through , because again I had lost Kallikrates ! And then , when all was done , behold ! he sighed , behold ! he lived , and I knew that he would live , for none die on whom the drug takes hold . Think of it now , my Holly - think of the wonder of it ! He will sleep for twelve hours and then the fever will have left him ! "
83932	83937	83883	83883	She	2162	" GO , WOMAN ! "
84000	84006	84007	84007	she	2162	" Almost had I forgotten , "
84010	84028	84030	84030	she	2162	" that woman , Ustane . What is she to Kallikrates - his servant , or - - "
84043	84061	84062	84062	I	0	" I understand that she is we d to him according to the custom of the Amahagger , "
84065	84071	84062	84062	I	0	" but I know not . "
84093	84100	84101	84101	she	2162	" Then there is an end , "
84112	84112	84101	84101	she	2162	"
84113	84118	84119	84119	I	0	" For what crime ? "
84124	84164	84119	84119	I	0	" She is guilty of naught that thou art not guilty of thyself , oh Ayesha . She loves the man , and he has been pleased to accept her love : where , then , is her sin ? "
84165	84175	84176	84176	she	2162	" Truly , oh Holly , thou art foolish , "
84182	84421	84176	84176	she	2162	" Where is her sin ? Her sin is that she stands between me and my desire . Well , I know that I can take him from her - for dwells there a man upon this earth , oh Holly , who could resist me if I put out my strength ? Men are faithful for so long only as temptations pass them by . If the temptation be but strong enough , then will the man yield , for every man , like every rope , hath his breaking strain , and passion is to men what gold and power are to women - the weight upon their weakness . Believe me , ill will it go with mortal woman in that heaven of which thou speakest , if only the spirits be more fair , for their lords will never turn to look upon them , and their Heaven will become their Hell . For man can be bought with woman 's beauty , if it be but beautiful enough ; and woman 's beauty can be ever bought with gold , if only there be gold enough . So was it in my day , and so it will be to the end of time . The world is a great mart , my Holly , where all things are for sale to whom who bids the highest in the currency of our desires . "
84467	84479	84480	84480	she	2164	" Else would it not be heaven , dost thou mean ? "
84484	84642	84480	84480	she	2164	" Fie on thee , Holly , to think so ill of us poor women ! Is it , then , marriage that marks the line between thy heaven and thy hell ? but enough of this . This is no time for disputing and the challenge of our wits . Why dost thou always dispute ? Art thou also a philosopher of these latter days ? As for this woman , she must die ; for , though I can take her lover from her , yet , while she lived , might he think tenderly of her , and that I can not away with . No other woman shall dwell in my Lord 's thoughts ; my empire shall be all my own . She hath had her day , let her be content ; for better is an hour with love than a century of loneliness - now the night shall swallow her . "
84643	84648	84649	84649	I	0	" Nay , nay , "
84652	84681	84649	84649	I	0	" it would be a wicked crime ; and from a crime naught comes but what is evil . For thine own sake , do not this deed . "
84682	85086	85123	85123	her	2167	" Is it , then , a crime , oh foolish man , to put away that which stands between us and our ends ? Then is our life one long crime , my Holly , since day by day we destroy that we may live , since in this world none save the strongest can endure . Those who are weak must perish ; the earth is to the strong , and the fruits thereof . For every tree that grows a score shall wither , that the strong one may take their share . We run to place and power over the dead bodies of those who fail and fall ; ay , we win the food we eat from out of the mouths of starving babes . It is the scheme of things . Thou sayest , too , that a crime breeds evil , but therein thou dost lack experience ; for out of crimes come many good things , and out of good grows much evil . The cruel rage of the tyrant may prove a blessing to the thousands who come after him , and the sweetheartedness of a holy man may make a nation slaves . Man doeth this , and doeth that from the good or evil of his heart ; but he knoweth not to what end his moral sense doth prompt him ; for when he striketh he is blind to where the blow shall fall , nor can he count the airy threads that weave the web of circumstance . Good and evil , love and hate , night and day , sweet and bitter , man and woman , heaven above and the earth beneath - all these things are necessary , one to the other , and who knows the end of each ? I tell thee that there is a hand of fate that twines them up to bear the burden of its purpose , and all things are gathered in that great rope to which all things are needful . Therefore doth it not become us to say this thing is evil and this good , or the dark is hateful and the light lovely ; for to other eyes than ours the evil may be the good and the darkness more beautiful than the day , or all alike be fair . Hearest thou , my Holly ? "
85234	85237	85238	85238	I	0	" Ayesha , "
85241	85409	85238	85238	I	0	" thou art too subtle for me ; but thou thyself hast told me that each man should be a law unto himself , and follow the teaching of his heart . Hath thy heart no mercy towards her whose place thou wouldst take ? Bethink thee - as thou sayest - though to me the thing is incredible - he whom thou desirest has returned to thee after many ages , and but now thou hast , as thou sayest also , wrung him from the jaws of death . Wilt thou celebrate his coming by the murder of one who loved him , and whom perchance he loved - one , at the least , who saved his life for thee when the spears of thy slaves would have made an end thereof ? Thou sayest also that in past days thou didst grievously wrong this man , that with thine own hand thou didst slay him because of the Egyptian Amenartas whom he loved . "
85410	85432	85433	85433	she	2171	" How knowest thou that , oh stranger ? How knowest thou that name ? I spoke it not to thee , "
85445	85451	85452	85452	I	0	" Perchance I dreamed it , "
85464	85638	85433	85433	she	2171	K"r . It seems that the dream was , indeed , a shadow of the truth . What came to thee of thy mad crime ? - two thousand years of waiting , was it not ? And now wouldst thou repeat the history ? Say what thou wilt , I tell thee that evil will come of it ; for to him who doeth , at the least , good breeds good and evil evil , even though in after days out of evil cometh good . Offences must needs come ; but woe to him by whom the offence cometh . So said that Messiah of whom I spoke to thee , and it was truly said . If thou slayest this innocent woman , I say unto thee that thou shalt be accursed , and pluck no fruit from thine ancient tree of love . Also , what thinkest thou ? How will this man take thee red - handed from the slaughter of her who loved and tended him ? "
85639	85644	85645	85645	she	2172	" As to that , "
85648	85776	85778	85778	she	2173	" I have already answered thee . Had I slain thee as well as her , yet should he love me , Holly , because he could not save himself from therefrom any more than thou couldst save thyself from dying , if by chance I slew thee , oh Holly . And yet maybe there is truth in what thou dost say ; for in some way it presseth on my mind . If it may be , I will spare this woman ; for have I not told thee that I am not cruel for the sake of cruelty ? I love not to see suffering , or to cause it . Let her come before me - quick now , before my mood changes , "
85845	85859	85860	85860	she	2173	" Is my lord dead ? Oh , say not he is dead , "
85894	85900	85901	85901	I	0	" Nay , he lives , "
85904	85912	85901	85901	I	0	" She hath saved him . Enter . "
85943	85946	85948	85948	Ayesha	114	" Stand , "
85955	85960	85951	85951	her	114	" and come hither . "
85980	85986	85987	85987	she	2173	" Who is this man ? "
85998	86005	86006	86006	she	2173	" The man is my husband , "
86013	86023	85977	85977	Ayesha	114	" Who gave him to thee for a husband ? "
86024	86039	85977	85977	Ayesha	114	" I took him according to the custom of our country , oh She . "
86040	86149	85977	85977	Ayesha	114	" Thou hast done evil , woman , in taking this man , who is a stranger . He is not a man of thine own race , and the custom fails . Listen : perchance thou didst this thing through ignorance , therefore , woman , do I spare thee , otherwise hadst thou died . Listen again . Go from hence back to thine own place , and never dare to speak to or set thine eyes upon this man again . He is not for thee . Listen a third time . If thou breakest this my law , that moment thou diest . Go . "
86156	86161	85977	85977	Ayesha	114	" Go , woman ! "
86178	86189	86190	86190	she	172	" Nay , oh She . I will not go , "
86197	86232	86190	86190	she	172	" the man is my husband , and I love him - I love him , and I will not leave him . What right hast thou to command me to leave my husband ? "
86252	86256	86257	86257	I	0	" Be pitiful , "
86262	86269	86257	86257	I	0	" it is but Nature working . "
86270	86275	86276	86276	she	172	" I am pitiful , "
86284	86297	86276	86276	she	172	" had I not been pitiful she had been dead even now . "
86303	86320	86276	86276	she	172	" Woman , I say to thee , go before I destroy thee where thou art ! "
86321	86333	86334	86334	she	172	" I will not go ! He is mine - mine ! "
86339	86373	86334	86334	she	172	" I took him , and I saved his life ! Destroy me , then , if thou hast the power ! I will not give thee my husband - never - never ! "
86461	86465	86466	86466	I	0	" Great heavens ! "
86487	86495	86496	86496	she	114	" Thou thinkest , poor ignorant fool , "
86503	86520	86522	86522	she	114	" that I have not the power to slay . Stay , there lies a mirror , "
86544	86575	86522	86522	she	114	" give it to this woman , my Holly , and let her see that which lies across her hair , and whether or no I have power to slay . "
86615	86630	86632	86632	Ayesha	114	" Now , wilt thou go , or must I strike a second time ? "
86637	86689	86632	86632	Ayesha	114	" Look , I have set my seal upon thee so that I may know thee till thy hair is all as white as it . If I see thy face again , be sure , too , that thy bones shall soon be whiter than my mark upon thy hair . "
86717	86726	86728	86728	Ayesha	114	" Look not so frighted , my Holly , "
86735	86872	86874	86874	she	2182	" I tell thee I deal not in magic - there is no such thing . ' Tis only a force that thou dost not understand . I marked her to strike terror to her heart , else must I have slain her . And now I will bid my servants to bear my Lord Kallikrates to a chamber near mine own , that I may watch over him , and be ready to greet him when he wakes ; and thither , too , shalt thou come , my Holly , and the white man , thy servant . But one thing remember at thy peril . Naught shalt thou say to Kallikrates as to how this woman went , and as little as may be of me . Now , I have warned thee ! "
87228	87312	87222	87222	they	2191	K"r , their imperial home ; I saw the drawbridges fall before them , and heard their bones clank through the brazen gates . On they went , up the splendid streets , on past fountains , palaces , and temples such as the eye of man never saw . But there was no man to greet them in the market - place , and no woman 's face appeared at the windows - only a bodiless voice went before them , calling : "
87316	87326	87343	87343	their	2199	K"r ! - fallen ! - fallen ! fallen ! "
87556	87564	87565	87565	she	2206	" Thou shalt see , oh Holly , "
87568	87584	87565	87565	she	2206	" presently shall he awake in his right mind , the fever having left him . "
87647	87668	87641	87641	he	183	" Hullo , Ustane , why have you tied your head up like that ? Have you got the toothache ? "
87675	87706	87641	87641	he	183	" I say , I 'm awfully hungry . Why , Job , you old son of a gun , where the deuce have we got to now - eh ? "
87707	87719	87721	87721	Job	137	" I am sure I wish I knew , Mr. Leo , "
87752	87783	87745	87745	she	114	" but you must n't talk , Mr. Leo , you 've been very ill , and given us a great deal of hanxiety , and , if this lady , "
87788	87804	87745	87745	she	114	" would be so kind as to move , I 'll bring you your soup . "
87812	87815	87745	87745	she	114	" lady , "
87824	87827	87828	87828	he	108	" Hullo ! "
87831	87841	87828	87828	he	108	" that is not Ustane - where is Ustane ? "
87862	87872	87873	87873	she	114	" She has gone from hence upon a visit , "
87876	87891	87873	87873	she	114	" and , behold , in her place am I here as thine handmaiden . "

88885	88895	88896	88896	she	2225	" Greeting to thee , my young stranger lord , "
88903	88949	88952	88952	she	2225	" Right glad am I to see thee upon thy feet . Believe me , had I not saved thee at the last , never wouldst thou have stood upon those feet again . But the danger is done , and it shall be my care "
88962	88970	88952	88952	she	2225	" that it doth return no more . "
89000	89003	89004	89004	she	2225	" Nay , "
89008	89038	89004	89004	she	2225	" ill could the world spare such a man . Beauty is too rare upon it . Give me no thanks , who am made happy by thy coming . "
89039	89045	89047	89047	Leo	108	" Humph ! old fellow , "
89054	89093	89047	89047	Leo	108	" the lady is very civil . We seem to have tumbled into clover . I hope that you have made the most of your opportunities . By Jove ! what a pair of arms she has got ! "
89125	89129	89132	89132	Ayesha	114	" I trust , "
89134	89172	89132	89132	Ayesha	114	" that my servants have attended well upon thee ; if there can be comfort in this poor place , be sure it waits on thee . Is there aught that I can do for thee more ? "
89173	89179	89181	89181	Leo	108	" Yes , oh She , "
89184	89202	89181	89181	Leo	108	" I would fain know whither the young lady who was looking after me has gone to . "
89203	89206	89208	89208	Ayesha	114	" Ah , "
89210	89261	89208	89208	Ayesha	114	" the girl - yes , I saw her . Nay , I know not ; she said that she would go , I know not whither . Perchance she will return , perchance not . It is wearisome waiting on the sick , and these savage women are fickle . "
89272	89278	89279	89279	he	108	" It 's very odd , "
89292	89298	89299	89299	he	108	" I can not understand , "
89302	89322	89299	89299	he	108	" the young lady and I - well - in short , we had a regard for each other . "

89594	89655	89589	89594	the poorer citizens of Imperial K"r	4289	K"r . These bodies were not nearly so well preserved as were those of the wealthier classes . Many of them had no linen covering on them , also they were buried from five hundred to one thousand in a single large vault , the corpses in some instances being thickly piled one upon another , like a heap of slain .
89705	89720	89766	89766	His	137	K"r , and also used to line the reservoirs and sewers . - L. H. H.
89869	89883	89884	89884	he	137	" There 's a nice thing to say of a man , sir , "
89894	89920	89884	89884	he	137	" but there , what can one expect of an old man - eating savage ? Not but what I dare say he 's right , "
90575	90579	90581	90581	he	137	" crawl up , "
90745	90751	90753	90753	Ayesha	114	" Thou wilt presently understand , "
90861	90865	90866	90866	he	108	" Great heaven ! "
90869	90876	90866	90866	he	108	" they are corpses on fire ! "
91364	91538	91680	91680	she	114	K"r burnt as , to judge from their sculptures and inscriptions , they had lived , very fast , and with the utmost liberality . What is more , there were plenty of them . As soon as ever a mummy had burnt down to the ankles , which it did in about twenty minutes , the feet were kicked away , and another one put in its place . The bonfire was kept going on the same generous scale , and its flames shot up , with a hiss and a crackle , twenty or thirty feet into the air , throwing great flashes of light far out into the gloom , through which the dark forms of the Amahagger flitted to and fro like devils replenishing the infernal fires . We all stood and stared aghast - shocked , and yet fascinated at so strange a spectacle , and half expecting to see the spirits those flaming forms had once enclosed come creeping from the shadows to work vengeance on their desecrators .
91539	91550	91552	91552	Ayesha	114	" I promised thee a strange sight , my Holly , "
91564	91678	91552	91552	Ayesha	114	" and , behold , I have not failed thee . Also , it hath its lesson . Trust not to the future , for who knows what the future may bring ! Therefore , live for the day , and endeavour not to escape the dust which seems to be man 's end . What thinkest thou those long - forgotten nobles and ladies would have felt had they known that they should one day flare to light the dance or boil the pot of savages ? But see , here come the dancers ; a merry crew - are they not ? The stage is lit - now for the play . "
91986	92006	92009	92009	she	2293	" I want a Black Goat , I must have a Black Goat , bring me a Black Goat ! "
92059	92066	92069	92071	one of them	2298	" She has got a Devil , "
92073	92107	92069	92071	one of them	2298	" Run and get a black goat . There , Devil , keep quiet ! keep quiet ! You shall have the goat presently . They have gone to fetch it , Devil . "
92108	92122	92124	92127	the foaming rolling creature	2299	" I want a Black Goat , I must have a Black Goat ! "
92130	92152	92124	92127	the foaming rolling creature	2299	" All right , Devil , the goat will be here presently ; keep quiet , there 's a good Devil ! "
92182	92195	92197	92198	the possessed	2300	" Is it a Black One , is it a Black One ? "
92200	92212	92069	92071	one of them	2298	" Yes , yes , Devil , as black as night ; "
92216	92262	92069	92071	one of them	2298	" keep it behind thee , do n't let the Devil see that it has got a white spot on its rump and another on its belly . In one minute , Devil . There , cut his throat quick . Where is the saucer ? "
92263	92310	92124	92127	the foaming rolling creature	2299	" The Goat ! the Goat ! the Goat ! Give me the blood of my black goat ! I must have it , do n't you see I must have it ? Oh ! oh ! oh ! give me the blood of the goat . "
92784	92787	92761	92761	it	2310	" Come , "
92867	92873	92876	92876	her	114	" Oh , my lord , "
92955	92955	92949	92949	thou	2315	"
92956	92961	92963	92963	Leo	108	" Of course not , "
92965	92985	92963	92963	Leo	108	" I have been wondering whither thou hadst gone . Let us go and explain matters to the Queen . "
92986	93046	92949	92949	thou	2315	" Nay , nay , she would slay us . Thou knowest not her power - the Baboon there , he knoweth , for he saw . Nay , there is but one way : if thou wilt cleave to me , thou must flee with me across the marshes even now , and then perchance we may escape . "
93047	93055	93056	93056	I	0	" For Heaven 's sake , Leo , "
93064	93094	93099	93099	she	2320	" Nay , listen not to him . Swift - be swift - death is in the air we breathe . Even now , mayhap , She heareth us , "
93325	93335	93336	93336	she	114	" Nay , now , my lord and guest , "
93353	93373	93336	93336	she	114	" look not so bashful . Surely the sight was a pretty one - the leopard and the lion ! "
93374	93381	93383	93383	Leo	108	" Oh , hang it all ! "
93387	93393	93394	93394	she	114	" And thou , Ustane , "
93419	93439	93394	93394	she	114	" and she pointed to the bright edge of the rising moon which was now appearing above the horizon . "
93499	93499	93494	93494	thee	108	"
93500	93506	93508	93510	the wretched woman	2327	" Play not with me , "

93524	93552	93554	93554	she	114	" Nay , why ? It is not well to go so swift from the hot lips of love down to the cold mouth of the grave , "
93609	93685	93606	93606	Ayesha	114	" It was well thrown , my guest ; thou hast a strong arm for one who so late was sick . But now out of thy courtesy I pray thee let that man live and do my bidding . He shall not harm the girl ; the night air grows chill , and I would welcome her in mine own place . Surely she whom thou dost favour shall be favoured of me also . "
93839	93845	93846	93846	Ayesha	114	" Now , oh Holly , "
93849	93865	93868	93868	she	114	" how came it that thou who didst hear my words bidding this evil - doer "
93873	93937	93868	93868	she	114	" to go hence - thou at whose prayer I did weakly spare her life - how came it , I say , that thou wast a sharer in what I saw to - night ? Answer , and for thine own sake , I say , speak all the truth , for I am not minded to hear lies upon this matter ! "
93938	93947	93948	93948	I	0	" It was by accident , oh Queen , "
93951	93958	93948	93948	I	0	" I knew naught of it . "
93959	93968	93969	93969	she	114	" I do believe thee , oh Holly , "
93973	93993	93969	93969	she	114	" and well it is for thee that I do - then does the whole guilt rest upon her . "
93994	94003	94006	94006	Leo	108	" I do not find any guilt therein , "
94008	94045	94046	94046	he	108	" She is not another man 's wife , and it appears that she has married me according to the custom of this awful place , so who is the worse ? Any way , madam , "
94050	94078	94079	94079	he	108	" whatever she has done I have done too , so if she is to be punished let me be punished also ; and I tell thee , "
94090	94113	94079	94079	he	108	" that if thou biddest one of those dead and dumb villains to touch her again I will tear him to pieces ! "
94145	94197	94141	94141	she	114	" Hast thou aught to say , woman ? Thou silly straw , thou feather , who didst think to float towards thy passion 's petty ends , even against the great wind of my will ! Tell me , for I fain would understand . Why didst thou this thing ? "
94276	94284	94285	94285	she	2339	" I did it , oh She , "
94309	94395	94285	94285	she	2339	" because my love is stronger than the grave . I did it because my life without this man whom my heart chose would be but a living death . Therefore did I risk my life , and , now that I know that it is forfeit to thine anger , yet am I glad that I did risk it , and pay it away in the risking , ay , because he embraced me once , and told me that he loved me yet . "
94410	94416	94421	94421	her	172	" I have no magic , "
94429	94479	94421	94421	her	172	" and I am not a Queen , nor do I live for ever , but a woman 's heart is heavy to sink through waters , however deep , oh Queen ! and a woman 's eyes are quick to see - even through thy veil , oh Queen !
94480	94579	94581	94581	she	2342	" Listen : I know it , thou dost love this man thyself , and therefore wouldst thou destroy me who stand across thy path . Ay , I die - I die , and go into the darkness , nor know I whither I go . But this I know . There is a light shining in my breast , and by that light , as by a lamp , I see the truth , and the future that I shall not share unroll itself before me like a scroll . When first I knew my lord , "
94586	94710	94581	94581	she	2342	" I knew also that death would be the bridal gift he gave me - it rushed upon me of a sudden , but I turned not back , being ready to pay the price , and , behold , death is here ! And now , even as I knew that , so do I , standing on the steps of doom , know that thou shalt not reap the profit of thy crime . Mine he is , and , though thy beauty shine like a sun among the stars , mine shall he remain for thee . Never here in this life shall he look thee in the eyes and call thee spouse . Thou too art doomed , I see "
94724	94731	94713	94713	her	2343	" ah , I see - - "
95057	95064	95065	95065	she	2345	" Forgive me , my guest , "
95072	95082	95065	95065	she	2345	" if I have shocked thee with my justice . "
95083	95090	95093	95093	Leo	108	" Forgive thee , thou fiend , "
95104	95122	95065	95065	she	2345	" Forgive thee , thou murderess ! By Heaven , I will kill thee if I can ! "
95123	95128	95129	95129	she	2345	" Nay , nay , "
95137	95196	95129	95129	she	2345	" thou dost not understand - the time has come for thee to learn . Thou art my love , my Kallikrates , my Beautiful , my Strong ! For two thousand years , Kallikrates , have I waited for thee , and now at length thou hast come back to me ; and as for this woman , "
95222	95222	95213	95213	I	0	"
95223	95230	95232	95232	Leo	108	" It is an accursed lie ! "
95234	95259	95232	95232	Leo	108	" My name is not Kallikrates ! I am Leo Vincey ; my ancestor was Kallikrates - at least , I believe he was . "
95260	95291	95213	95213	I	0	" Ah , thou sayest it - thine ancestor was Kallikrates , and thou , even thou , art Kallikrates reborn , come back - and mine own dear lord ! "
95292	95334	95232	95232	Leo	108	" I am not Kallikrates , and , as for being thy lord , or having aught to do with thee , I had sooner be the lord of a fiend from hell , for she would be better than thou . "
95335	95372	95213	95213	I	0	" Sayest thou so - sayest thou so , Kallikrates ? Nay , but thou hast not seen me for so long a time that no memory remains . Yet am I very fair , Kallikrates ! "
95373	95406	95232	95232	Leo	108	" I hate thee , murderess , and I have no wish to see thee . What is it to me how fair thou art ? I hate thee , I say . "
95407	95429	95431	95431	Ayesha	114	" Yet within a very little space shalt thou creep to my knee , and swear that thou dost love me , "
95440	95468	95431	95431	Ayesha	114	" Come , there is no time like the present time , here before this dead girl who loved thee , let us put it to the proof .
95469	95477	95483	95483	she	114	" Look now on me , Kallikrates ! "
95764	95770	95772	95772	Leo	108	" Oh , great Heaven ! "
95774	95780	95772	95772	Leo	108	" art thou a woman ? "
95781	95798	95799	95799	she	3243	" A woman in truth - in very truth - and thine own spouse , Kallikrates ! "
95853	95858	95859	95859	he	108	" How can I ? "
95863	95873	95859	95859	he	108	" Thou art a murderess ; she loved me . "
95886	95891	95892	95892	she	3243	" It is naught , "
95910	95954	95958	95958	she	3243	" It is naught at all . If I have sinned , let my beauty answer for my sin . If I have sinned , it is for love of thee : let my sin , therefore , be put away and forgotten ; "
95965	95968	95958	95958	she	3243	" Come , "
96270	96302	96263	96263	her	3243	" Did I not tell thee that within a little space thou wouldst creep to my knee , oh Kallikrates ? And surely the space has not been a great one ! "
96481	96488	96490	96490	Ayesha	114	" There passes the dead past , "
96943	96946	96935	96935	he	2371	" Khâteb , "
97006	97010	97021	97022	Mr. Holly	109	" Al Modhahabât , "
97470	97721	97439	97439	her	2385	" Perchance thou dost not believe my word , Kallikrates - perchance thou thinkest that I do delude thee , and that I have not lived these many years , and that thou hast not been born again to me . Nay , look not so - put away that pale cast of doubt , for oh be sure herein can error find no foothold ! Sooner shall the suns forget their course and the swallow miss her nest , than my soul shall swear a lie and be led astray from thee , Kallikrates . Blind me , take away mine eyes , and let the darkness utterly fence me in , and still mine ears would catch the tone of thy unforgotten voice , striking more loud against the portals of my sense than can the call of brazen - throated clarions : - stop up mine hearing also , and let a thousand touch me on the brow , and I would name thee out of all : - yea , rob me of every sense , and see me stand deaf and blind , and dumb , and with nerves that can not weigh the value of a touch , yet would my spirit leap within me like a quickening child and cry unto my heart , behold Kallikrates ! behold , thou watcher , the watches of thy night are ended ! behold thou who seekest in the night season , thy morning Star ariseth . "
97729	97797	97722	97722	She	2386	" But stay , if thy heart is yet hardened against the mighty truth and thou dost require a further pledge of that which thou dost find too deep to understand , even now shall it be given to thee , and to thee also , oh my Holly . Bear each one of you a lamp , and follow after me whither I shall lead you . "
97853	97856	97857	97857	she	2386	" boudoir , "
97878	98037	97857	97857	she	2386	K"r . As we hurried down the stair I observed that the steps were worn in the centre to such an extent that some of them had been reduced from seven and a half inches , at which I guessed their original height , to about three and a half . Now , all the other steps that I had seen in the caves were practically unworn , as was to be expected , seeing that the only traffic which ever passed upon them was that of those who bore a fresh burden to the tomb . Therefore this fact struck my notice with that curious force with which little things do strike us when our minds are absolutely overwhelmed by a sudden rush of powerful sensations ; beaten flat , as it were , like a sea beneath the first burst of a hurricane , so that every little object on the surface starts into an unnatural prominence .
98061	98078	98079	98079	she	114	" Wonderest thou whose are the feet that have worn away the rock , my Holly ? "
98082	98132	98079	98079	she	114	" They are mine - even mine own light feet ! I can remember when those stairs were fresh and level , but for two thousand years and more have I gone down hither day by day , and see , my sandals have worn out the solid rock ! "
98331	98346	98348	98348	Ayesha	114	" See now the place where I have slept for these two thousand years , "
98441	98444	98450	98450	her	114	" Here , "
98456	98492	98494	98494	she	114	" here have I slept night by night for all these generations , with but a cloak to cover me . It did not become me that I should lie soft when my spouse yonder , "
98501	98600	98494	98494	she	114	" lay stiff in death . Here night by night have I slept in his cold company - till , thou seest , this thick slab , like the stairs down which we passed , has worn thin with the tossing of my form - so faithful have I been to thee even in thy space of sleep , Kallikrates . And now , mine own , thou shalt see a wonderful thing - living , thou shalt behold thyself dead - for well have I tended thee during all these years , Kallikrates . Art thou prepared ? "
98644	98649	98650	98650	she	114	" Be not affrighted , "
98653	98733	98650	98650	she	114	" though the thing seem wonderful to thee - all we who live have thus lived before ; nor is the very shape that holds us a stranger to the sun ! Only we know it not , because memory writes no record , and earth hath gathered in the earth she lent us , for none have saved our glory from the grave . But I , by my arts and by the arts of those dead men of K"r
98815	98951	99089	99089	she	2405	" Behold now , let the Dead and Living meet ! Across the gulf of Time they still are one . Time hath no power against Identity , though sleep the merciful hath blotted out the tablets of our mind , and with oblivion sealed the sorrows that else would hound us from life to life , stuffing the brain with gathered griefs till it burst in the madness of uttermost despair . Still are they one , for the wrappings of our sleep shall roll away as thunder - clouds before the wind ; the frozen voice of the past shall melt in music like mountain snows beneath the sun ; and the weeping and the laughter of the lost hours shall be heard once more most sweetly echoing up the cliffs of immeasurable time .
98952	99025	99089	99089	she	2405	" Ay , the sleep shall roll away , and the voices shall be heard , when down the completed chain , whereof our each existence is a link , the lightning of the Spirit hath passed to work out the purpose of our being ; quickening and fusing those separated days of life , and shaping them to a staff whereon we may safely lean as we wend to our appointed fate .
99026	99080	99089	99089	she	2405	" Therefore , have no fear , Kallikrates , when thou - living , and but lately born - shalt look upon thine own departed self , who breathed and died so long ago . I do but turn one page in thy Book of Being , and show thee what is writ thereon .
99081	99084	99089	99089	she	2405	" Behold ! "
99382	99392	99374	99374	he	108	" Cover it up , and take me away . "
99393	99400	99402	99402	Ayesha	114	" Nay , wait , Kallikrates , "
99472	99521	99447	99447	she	114	" Wait , I would show thee something , that no tittle of my crime may be hidden from thee . Do thou , oh Holly , open the garment on the breast of the dead Kallikrates , for perchance my lord may fear to touch it himself . "
99576	99582	99583	99583	she	114	" Thou seest , Kallikrates , "
99586	99860	99583	99583	she	114	" Know then that it was I who slew thee : in the Place of Life I gave thee death . I slew thee because of the Egyptian Amenartas , whom thou didst love , for by her wiles she held thy heart , and her I could not smite as but now I smote that woman , for she was too strong for me . In my haste and bitter anger I slew thee , and now for all these days have I lamented thee , and waited for thy coming . And thou hast come , and none can stand between thee and me , and of a truth now for death I will give thee life - not life eternal , for that none can give , but life and youth that shall endure for thousands upon thousands of years , and with it pomp , and power , and wealth , and all things that are good and beautiful , such as have been to no man before thee , nor shall be to any man who comes after . And now one thing more , and thou shalt rest and make ready for the day of thy new birth . Thou seest this body , which was thine own . For all these centuries it hath been my cold comfort and my companion , but now I need it no more , for I have thy living presence , and it can but serve to stir up memories of that which I would fain forget . Let it therefore go back to the dust from which I held it .

100242	100279	100239	100239	she	2412	" and sleep if ye may . I must watch and think , for to - morrow night we go hence , and the time is long since I trod the path that we must follow . "

100588	100627	100572	100572	he	137	" I let her be killed - not that I could help that , but within five minutes I was kissing her murderess over her body . I am a degraded brute , but I can not resist that "
100634	100780	100630	100630	his	137	" that awful sorceress . I know I shall do it again to - morrow ; I know that I am in her power for always ; if I never saw her again I should never think of anybody else during all my life ; I must follow her as a needle follows a magnet ; I would not go away now if I could ; I could not leave her , my legs would not carry me , but my mind is still clear enough , and in my mind I hate her - at least , I think so . It is all so horrible ; and that - that body ! What can I make of it ? It was I ! I am sold into bondage , old fellow , and she will take my soul as the price of herself ! "
102011	102170	102206	102206	his	2459	K"r ? Who would have thought that in the person of Leo this mysterious woman should , as she believed , discover the being whom she awaited from century to century , and whose former earthly habitation she had till this very night preserved ? But so it was . In the face of all we had seen it was difficult for us as ordinary reasoning men any longer to doubt its truth , and therefore at last , with humble hearts and a deep sense of the impotence of human knowledge , and the insolence of its assumption that denies that to be possible which it has no experience of , we laid ourselves down to sleep , leaving our fates in the hands of that watching Providence which had thus chosen to allow us to draw the veil of human ignorance , and reveal to us for good or evil some glimpse of the possibilities of life .

The Witch of Endor was a fool to her , sir : bless you , she would make no more of raising every gentleman in the Bible out of these here beastly tombs than I should of growing cress on an old flannel . It 's a country of devils , this is , sir , and she 's the master one of the lot ; and if ever we get out of it it will be more than I expect to do . I do n't see no way out of it . That witch is n't likely to let a fine young man like Mr. Leo go . "

102513	102611	102334	102334	he	137	" Yes , and she 'll take his soul to pay for it . She 'll make him a witch , like herself . I say it 's wicked to have anything to do with those sort of people . Last night , sir , I lay awake and read in my little Bible that my poor old mother gave me about what is going to happen to sorceresses and them sort , till my hair stood on end . Lord , how the old lady would stare if she saw where her Job had got to ! "
102612	102629	102630	102630	I	0	" Yes , it 's a queer country , and a queer people too , Job , "
102666	102673	102674	102674	he	137	" You are right , sir , "
102677	102705	102707	102707	Leo	108	" and if you wo n't think me very foolish , I should like to say something to you now that Mr. Leo is out of the way "
102718	102819	102707	102707	Leo	108	" and that is that I know it is the last country as ever I shall see in this world . I had a dream last night , and I dreamed that I saw my old father with a kind of night - shirt on him , something like these folks wear when they want to be in particular full - dress , and a bit of that feathery grass in his hand , which he may have gathered on the way , for I saw lots of it yesterday about three hundred yards from the mouth of this beastly cave .
102820	102944	102707	102707	Leo	108	" ' Job , ' he said to me , solemn like , and yet with a kind of satisfaction shining through him , more like a Methody parson when he has sold a neighbour a marked horse for a sound one and cleared twenty pounds by the job than anything I can think on - ' Job , time 's up , Job ; but I never did expect to have to come and hunt you out in this ' ere place , Job . Such ado as I have had to nose you up ; it was n't friendly to give your poor old father such a run , let alone that a wonderful lot of bad characters hail from this place K"r

102956	103008	103011	103011	Job	137	" Yes , sir - of course , sir , that 's just what he said they was - ' cautions , downright scorchers ' - sir , and I 'm sure I do n't doubt it , seeing what I know of them , and their hot - potting ways , "
103014	103083	103011	103011	Job	137	" Anyway , he was sure that time was up , and went away saying that we should see more than we cared for of each other soon , and I suppose he was a - thinking of the fact that father and I never could hit it off together for longer nor three days , and I daresay that things will be similar when we meet again . "
103084	103087	103088	103088	I	0	" Surely , "
103091	103137	103088	103088	I	0	" you do n't think that you are going to die because you dreamed you saw your old father ; if one dies because one dreams of one 's father , what happens to a man who dreams of his mother - in - law ? "
103138	103149	103151	103151	Job	137	" Ah , sir , you 're laughing at me , "
103153	103468	103151	103151	Job	137	" but , you see , you did n't know my old father . If it had been anybody else - my Aunt Mary , for instance , who never made much of a job - I should not have thought so much of it ; but my father was that idle , which he should n't have been with seventeen children , that he would never have put himself out to come here just to see the place . No , sir ; I know that he meant business . Well , sir , I ca n't help it ; I suppose every man must go some time or other , though it is a hard thing to die in a place like this , where Christian burial is n't to be had for its weight in gold . I 've tried to be a good man , sir , and do my duty honest , and if it was n't for the supercilus kind of way in which father carried on last night - a sort of sniffing at me as it were , as though he had n't no opinion of my references and testimonials - I should feel easy enough in my mind . Any way , sir , I 've been a good servant to you and Mr. Leo , bless him ! - why , it seems but the other day that I used to lead him about the streets with a penny whip ; - and if ever you get out of this place - which , as father did n't allude to you , perhaps you may - I hope you will think kindly of my whitened bones , and never have anything more to do with Greek writing on flower - pots , sir , if I may make so bold as to say so . "
103469	103476	103477	103477	I	0	" Come , come , Job , "
103481	103524	103477	103477	I	0	" this is all nonsense , you know . You must n't be silly enough to go getting such ideas into your head . We 've lived through some queer things , and I hope that we may go on doing so . "
103525	103530	103532	103532	Job	137	" No , sir , "
103545	103690	103532	103532	Job	137	" it is n't nonsense . I 'm a doomed man , and I feel it , and a wonderful uncomfortable feeling it is , sir , for one ca n't help wondering how it 's going to come about . If you are eating your dinner you think of poison and it goes against your stomach , and if you are walking along these dark rabbit - burrows you think of knives , and Lord , do n't you just shiver about the back ! I ai n't particular , sir , provided it 's sharp , like that poor girl , who , now that she 's gone , I am sorry to have spoke hard on , though I do n't approve of her morals in getting married , which I consider too quick to be decent . Still , sir , "
103703	103717	103699	103699	he	137	" I do hope it wo n't be that hot - pot game . "

103741	103820	103822	103822	he	137	" it is n't my place to differ from you , sir , but if you happen to be going anywhere , sir , I should be obliged if you could manage to take me with you , seeing that I shall be glad to have a friendly face to look at when the time comes , just to help one through , as it were . And now , sir , I 'll be getting the breakfast , "

First , must thou be even as I am , not immortal indeed , for that I am not , but so cased and hardened against the attacks of Time that his arrows shall glance from the armour of thy vigorous life as the sunbeams glance from water . As yet I may not mate with thee , for thou and I are different , and the very brightness of my being would burn thee up , and perchance destroy thee . Thou couldst not even endure to look upon me for too long a time lest thine eyes should ache , and thy senses swim , and therefore "
104438	104448	104282	104282	she	114	" This by the way she did not do . "

"
104686	104692	104694	104694	Leo	108	" Hulloa , old fellow ! "
104704	104720	104694	104694	Leo	108	" have you been paying compliments ? I should never have thought it of you ! "
104721	104729	104730	104730	I	0	" I thank thee , oh Ayesha , "
104742	104975	104730	104730	I	0	" but if there be such a place as thou dost describe , and if in this strange place there may be found a fiery virtue that can hold off Death when he comes to pluck us by the hand , yet would I none of it . For me , oh Ayesha , the world has not proved so soft a nest that I would lie in it for ever . A stony - hearted mother is our earth , and stones are the bread she gives her children for their daily food . Stones to eat and bitter water for their thirst , and stripes for tender nurture . Who would endure this for many lives ? Who would so load up his back with memories of lost hours and loves , and of his neighbour 's sorrows that he can not lessen , and wisdom that brings not consolation ? Hard is it to die , because our delicate flesh doth shrink back from the worm it will not feel , and from that unknown which the winding - sheet doth curtain from our view . But harder still , to my fancy , would it be to live on , green in the leaf and fair , but dead and rotten at the core , and feel that other secret worm of recollection gnawing ever at the heart . "
104976	104982	104983	104983	she	2484	" Bethink thee , Holly , "
104986	105008	104983	104983	she	2484	" yet doth long life and strength and beauty beyond measure mean power and all things that are dear to man . "
105009	105016	105017	105017	I	0	" And what , oh Queen , "
105020	105274	105017	105017	I	0	" are those things that are dear to man ? Are they not bubbles ? Is not ambition but an endless ladder by which no height is ever climbed till the last unreachable rung is mounted ? For height leads on to height , and there is no resting - place upon them , and rung doth grow upon rung , and there is no limit to the number . Doth not wealth satiate , and become nauseous , and no longer serve to satisfy or pleasure , or to buy an hour 's peace of mind ? And is there any end to wisdom that we may hope to reach it ? Rather , the more we learn , shall we not thereby be able only to better compass out our ignorance ? Did we live ten thousand years could we hope to solve the secrets of the suns , and of the space beyond the suns , and of the Hand that hung them in the heavens ? Would not our wisdom be but as a gnawing hunger calling our consciousness day by day to a knowledge of the empty craving of our souls ? Would it not be but as a light in one of these great caverns , that , though bright it burn , and brighter yet , doth but the more serve to show the depths of the gloom around it ? And what good thing is there beyond that we may gain by length of days ? "
105275	105346	104983	104983	she	2484	" Nay , my Holly , there is love - love which makes all things beautiful , and doth breathe divinity into the very dust we tread . With love shall life roll gloriously on from year to year , like the voice of some great music that hath power to hold the hearer 's heart poised on eagles ' wings above the sordid shame and folly of the earth . "
105347	105353	105354	105354	I	0	" It may be so , "
105357	105585	105354	105354	I	0	" but if the loved one prove a broken reed to pierce us , or if the love be loved in vain - what then ? Shall a man grave his sorrows upon a stone when he hath but need to write them on the water ? Nay , oh She , I will live my day , and grow old with my generation , and die my appointed death , and be forgotten . For I do hope for an immortality to which the little span that perchance thou canst confer will be but as a finger 's length laid against the measure of the great world ; and , mark this ! the immortality to which I look , and which my faith doth promise me , shall be free from the bonds that here must tie my spirit down . For , while the flesh endures , sorrow and evil and the scorpion whips of sin must endure also ; but when the flesh hath fallen from us , then shall the spirit shine forth clad in the brightness of eternal good , and for its common air shall breathe so rare an ether of most noble thoughts that the highest aspiration of our manhood , or the purest incense of a maiden 's prayer , would prove too earthly gross to float therein . "
105586	105591	105593	105593	Ayesha	114	" Thou lookest high , "
105600	105947	105593	105593	Ayesha	114	" and speakest clearly as a trumpet and with no uncertain sound . And yet methinks that but now didst thou talk of ' that Unknown ' from which the winding - sheet doth curtain us . But perchance , thou seest with the eye of Faith , gazing on that brightness , that is to be , through the painted - glass of thy imagination . Strange are the pictures of the future that mankind can thus draw with this brush of faith and this many - coloured pigment of imagination ! Strange , too , that no one of them doth agree with another ! I could tell thee - but there , what is the use ? why rob a fool of his bauble ? Let it pass , and I pray , oh Holly , that when thou dost feel old age creeping slowly toward thyself , and the confusion of senility making havoc in thy brain , thou mayest not bitterly regret that thou didst cast away the imperial boon I would have given to thee . But so it hath ever been ; man can never be content with that which his hand can pluck . If a lamp be in his reach to light him through the darkness , he must needs cast it down because it is no star . Happiness danceth ever apace before him , like the marsh - fires in the swamps , and he must catch the fire , and he must hold the star ! Beauty is naught to him , because there are lips more honey - sweet ; and wealth is naught , because others can weigh him down with heavier shekels ; and fame is naught , because there have been greater men than he . Thyself thou saidst it , and I turn thy words against thee . Well , thou dreamest that thou shalt pluck the star . I believe it not , and I think thee a fool , my Holly , to throw away the lamp . "
106028	106032	106035	106035	She	2485	" And now , "
106045	106097	106035	106035	She	2485	" tell me , my Kallikrates , for as yet I know it not , how came ye to seek me here ? Yesternight thou didst say that Kallikrates - him whom thou sawest - was thine ancestor . How was it ? Tell me - thou dost not speak overmuch ! "
106151	106342	106136	106136	Ayesha	114	" Did I not tell thee one day , when we did talk of good and evil , oh Holly - it was when my beloved lay so ill - that out of good came evil , and out of evil good - that they who sowed knew not what the crop should be , nor he who struck where the blow should fall ? See , now : this Egyptian Amenartas , this royal child of the Nile who hated me , and whom even now I hate , for in a way she did prevail against me - see , now , she herself hath been the very means to bring her lover to mine arms ! For her sake I slew him , and now , behold , through her he hath come back to me ! She would have done me evil , and sowed her seeds that I might reap tares , and behold she hath given me more than all the world can give , and there is a strange square for thee to fit into thy circle of good and evil , oh Holly !
106343	106347	106348	106348	she	2489	" And so , "
106356	106422	106424	106424	she	2490	" and so she bade her son destroy me if he might , because I slew his father . And thou , my Kallikrates , art the father , and in a sense thou art likewise the son ; and wouldst thou avenge thy wrong , and the wrong of that far - off mother of thine , upon me , oh Kallikrates ? See , "

106543	106548	106549	106549	he	2495	" Rise , Ayesha , "
106553	106606	106549	106549	he	2495	" well thou knowest that I can not strike thee , no , not even for the sake of her whom thou slewest but last night . I am in thy power , and a very slave to thee . How can I kill thee ? - sooner should I slay myself . "
106607	106618	106619	106619	she	2490	" Almost dost thou begin to love me , Kallikrates , "
106624	106674	106619	106619	she	2490	" And now tell me of thy country - ' tis a great people , is it not ? with an empire like that of Rome ! Surely thou wouldst return thither , and it is well , for I mean not that thou shouldst dwell in these caves of K"r
106779	106779	106772	106772	thou	2496	"

107148	107232	107234	107234	Yea	2511	" And now leave me , I pray thee , and thou too , my own Kallikrates , for I would get me ready against our journey , and so must ye both , and your servant also . But bring no great quantity of things with thee , for I trust that we shall be but three days gone . Then shall we return hither , and I will make a plan whereby we can bid farewell for ever to these sepulchres of K"r

108253	108356	108249	108253	these old people of K"r	4558	K"r for their capital , and at the marvellous amount of labour , ingenuity , and engineering skill that must have been brought into requisition by the founders of the city to drain so huge a sheet of water , and to keep it clear of subsequent accumulations . It is , indeed , so far as my experience goes , an unequalled instance of what man can do in the face of nature , for in my opinion such achievements as the Suez Canal or even the Mont Cenis Tunnel do not approach this ancient undertaking in magnitude and grandeur of conception .
108391	108571	108249	108253	these old people of K"r	4558	K"r , and which in some degree atoned for the want of any land or sea breeze - for all wind was kept off by the rocky mountain wall - we began to get a clear view of what Billali had informed us were the ruins of the great city . And even from that distance we could see how wonderful those ruins were , a fact which with every step we took became more evident . The town was not very large if compared to Babylon or Thebes , or other cities of remote antiquity ; perhaps its outer wall contained some twelve square miles of ground , or a little more . Nor had the walls , so far as we could judge when we reached them , been very high , probably not more than forty feet , which was about their present height where they had not through the sinking of the ground , or some such cause , fallen into ruin . The reason of this , no doubt , was that the people of K"r
108862	108947	108950	108950	us	2545	K"r was not burnt or destroyed by an enemy or an earthquake , but deserted , owing to the action of a terrible plague . Consequently the houses were left unharmed ; also the climate of the plain is remarkably fine and dry , and there is very little rain or wind ; as a result of which these relics have only to contend against the unaided action of time , that works but slowly upon such massive blocks of masonry . - L.

109638	109647	109648	109648	she	114	" There was a spot here , Kallikrates , "
109662	109703	109648	109648	she	114	" where one might sleep . Two thousand years ago did thou and I and that Egyptian asp rest therein , but since then have I not set foot here , nor any man , and perchance it has fallen , "
109757	109762	109763	109763	she	114	" It is here , "

110141	110182	110125	110125	she	114	" I brought you - nay , it is strange , but knowest thou , Kallikrates , that thou liest at this moment upon the very spot where thy dead body lay when I bore thee back to those caves of K"r

110239	110244	110247	110247	Ayesha	114	" I brought you , "
110250	110274	110247	110247	Ayesha	114	" that ye might look upon the most wonderful sight that ever the eye of man beheld - the full moon shining over ruined K"r

It was a wonderful thing to think for how many thousands of years the dead orb above and the dead city below had gazed thus upon each other , and in the utter solitude of space poured forth each to each the tale of their lost life and long - departed glory . The white light fell , and minute by minute the quiet shadows crept across the grass - grown courts like the spirits of old priests haunting the habitations of their worship - the white light fell , and the long shadows grew till the beauty and grandeur of each scene and the untamed majesty of its present Death seemed to sink into our very souls , and speak more loudly than the shouts of armies concerning the pomp and splendour that the grave had swallowed , and even memory had forgotten .
110758	110761	110763	110763	Ayesha	114	" Come , "
110779	110822	110763	110763	Ayesha	114	" and I will show you the stony flower of Loveliness and Wonder 's very crown , if yet it stands to mock time with its beauty and fill the heart of man with longing for that which is behind the veil , "

111236	111283	111234	111234	Ayesha	114	" Where then is thy imagination ? It is Truth standing on the World , and calling to its children to unveil her face . See what is writ upon the pedestal . Without doubt it is taken from the book of Scriptures of these men of K"r
111285	111332	111234	111234	Ayesha	114	" and she led the way to the foot of the statue , where an inscription of the usual Chinese - looking hieroglyphics was so deeply graven as to be still quite legible , at least to Ayesha . According to her translation it ran thus : -
111333	111381	111234	111234	Ayesha	114	" Is there no man that will draw my veil and look upon my face , for it is very fair ? Unto him who draws my veil shall I be , and peace will I give him , and sweet children of knowledge and good works . "
111387	111445	111234	111234	Ayesha	114	" Though all those who seek after thee desire thee , behold ! Virgin art thou , and Virgin shalt thou go till Time be done . No man is there born of woman who may draw thy veil and live , nor shall be . By Death only can thy veil be drawn , oh Truth ! "
111473	111477	111479	111479	Ayesha	114	" Thou seest , "
111487	111497	111482	111482	she	114	" Truth was the Goddess of the people of old K"r

111937	111984	111985	111985	she	114	" ill . This night have strange and hideous dreams come creeping through my brain , and I know not what they may portend . Almost do I feel as though some evil overshadowed me ; and yet how can evil touch me ? I wonder , "
111996	112051	111985	111985	she	114	" I wonder if , should aught happen to me , so that I slept awhile and left thee waking , thou wouldst think gently of me ? I wonder , my Kallikrates , if thou wouldst tarry till I came again , as for so many centuries I have tarried for thy coming ? "
112064	112098	112060	112060	she	114	" Come , let us be setting forth , for we have far to go , and before another day is born in yonder blue should we stand in the place of Life . "

112539	112585	112533	112533	She	114	" best is it that he should tarry also , for if his heart be not high and his courage great , perchance some evil might overtake him . Also , the secrets of the place whither we go are not fit for common eyes . "

At the mouth of this cave Ayesha halted , and bade us light the two lamps , which I did , giving one to her and keeping the other myself . Then , taking the lead , she advanced down the cavern , picking her way with great care , as indeed it was necessary to do , for the floor was most irregular - strewn with boulders like the bed of a stream , and in some places pitted with deep holes , in which it would have been easy to break one 's leg .

117035	117109	117116	117116	she	2728	" Wouldst thou believe , oh Holly , that once a man did choose this airy nest for a daily habitation , and did here endure for many years ; leaving it only but one day in every twelve to seek food and water and oil that the people brought , more than he could carry , and laid as an offering in the mouth of the tunnel through which we passed hither ? "
117119	117154	117116	117116	she	2728	" Yet so it was . There was a man - Noot , he named himself - who , though he lived in the latter days , had of the wisdom of the sons of K"r
117636	117649	117627	117627	his	2750	" and she pointed to a spot near where I was sitting ; "
117669	117669	117709	117709	Ayesha	114	"
117714	117717	117718	117718	she	114	" Yes , "
117721	117976	117718	117718	she	114	" it is his without a doubt . Behold what remaineth of Noot , and the wisdom of Noot - one little tooth ! And yet that man had all life at his command , and for his conscience ' sake would have none of it . Well , he lay there newly dead , and we descended whither I shall lead you , and then , gathering up all my courage , and courting death that I might perchance win so glorious a crown of life , I stepped into the flames , and behold ! life such as ye can never know until ye feel it also , flowed into me , and I came forth undying , and lovely beyond imagining . Then did I stretch out mine arms to thee , Kallikrates , and bid thee take thine immortal bride , and behold , as I spoke , thou , blinded by my beauty , didst turn from me , and throw thine arms about the neck of Amenartas . And then a great fury filled me , and made me mad , and I seized the javelin that thou didst bear , and stabbed thee , so that there , at my very feet , in the place of Life , thou didst groan and go down into death . I knew not then that I had strength to slay with mine eyes and by the power of my will , therefore in my madness slew I with the javelin .
118008	118025	118026	118026	We	2751	" Then in her rage did she smite him by her magic , and he died . "
118148	118344	118820	118820	her	2758	" And when thou wast dead , ah ! I wept , because I was undying and thou wast dead . I wept there in the place of Life so that had I been mortal any more my heart had surely broken . And she , the swart Egyptian - she cursed me by her gods . By Osiris did she curse me and by Isis , by Nephthys and by Anubis , by Sekhet , the cat - headed , and by Set , calling down evil on me , evil and everlasting desolation . Ah ! I can see her dark face now lowering o'er me like a storm , but she could not hurt me , and I - I know not if I could hurt her . I did not try ; it was naught to me then ; so together we bore thee hence . And afterwards I sent her - the Egyptian - away through the swamps , and it seems that she lived to bear a son and to write the tale that should lead thee , her husband , back to me , her rival and thy murderess .
118345	118811	118820	118820	her	2758	" Such is the tale , my love , and now is the hour at hand that shall set a crown upon it . Like all things on the earth , it is compounded of evil and of good - more of evil than of good , perchance ; and writ in letters of blood . It is the truth ; naught have I hidden from thee , Kallikrates . And now one thing before the final moment of thy trial . We go down into the presence of Death , for Life and Death are very near together , and - who knoweth ? - that might happen which should separate us for another space of waiting . I am but a woman , and no prophetess , and I can not read the future . But this I know - for I learned it from the lips of the wise man Noot - that my life is but prolonged and made more bright . It can not live for aye . Therefore , before we go , tell me , oh Kallikrates , that of a truth thou dost forgive me , and dost love me from thy heart . See , Kallikrates : much evil have I done - perchance it was evil but two nights ago to strike that girl who loved thee cold in death - but she disobeyed me and angered me , prophesying misfortune to me , and I smote . Be careful when power comes to thee also , lest thou too shouldst smite in thine anger or thy jealousy , for unconquerable strength is a sore weapon in the hands of erring man . Yea , I have sinned - out of the bitterness born of a great love have I sinned - but yet do I know the good from the evil , nor is my heart altogether hardened . Thy love , Kallikrates , shall be the gate of my redemption , even as aforetime my passion was the path down which I ran to evil . For deep love unsatisfied is the hell of noble hearts and a portion of the accursed , but love that is mirrored back more perfect from the soul of our desired doth fashion wings to lift us above ourselves , and makes us what we might be . Therefore , Kallikrates , take me by the hand , and lift my veil with no more fear than though I were some peasant girl , and not the wisest and most beauteous woman in this wide world , and look me in the eyes , and tell me that thou dost forgive me with all thine heart , and that will all thine heart thou dost worship me . "
118959	119027	118929	118929	he	108	" Ayesha , I love thee with all my heart , and so far as forgiveness is possible I forgive thee the death of Ustane . For the rest , it is between thee and thy Maker ; I know naught of it . I only know that I love thee as I never loved before , and that I will cleave to thee to the end . "
119028	119031	119033	119033	Ayesha	114	" Now , "
119039	119076	119078	119078	she	114	" now when my lord doth speak thus royally and give with so free a hand , it can not become me to lag behind in words , and be beggared of my generosity . Behold ! "
119106	119123	119125	119125	she	114	" Behold ! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord ! Behold ! "
119132	119147	119149	119149	she	114	" in token of my wifely love do I kiss my lord . Behold ! "
119157	119213	119149	119149	she	114	" by the sin I sinned , by my lonely centuries of waiting wherewith it was wiped out , by the great love wherewith I love , and by the Spirit - the Eternal Thing that doth beget all life , from whom it ebbs , to whom it doth return again - I swear : -
119214	119358	119149	119149	she	114	" I swear , even in this most holy hour of completed Womanhood , that I will abandon Evil and cherish Good . I swear that I will be ever guided by thy voice in the straightest path of Duty . I swear that I will eschew Ambition , and through all my length of endless days set Wisdom over me as a guiding star to lead me unto Truth and a knowledge of the Right . I swear also that I will honour and will cherish thee , Kallikrates , who hast been swept by the wave of time back into my arms , ay , till the very end , come it soon or late . I swear - nay , I will swear no more , for what are words ? Yet shalt thou learn that Ayesha hath no false tongue .
119359	119432	119149	119149	she	114	" So I have sworn , and thou , my Holly , art witness to my oath . Here , too , are we we d , my husband , with the gloom for bridal canopy - we d till the end of all things ; here do we write our marriage vows upon the rushing winds which shall bear them up to heaven , and round and continually round this rolling world .
119433	119576	119149	119149	she	114	" And for a bridal gift I crown thee with my beauty 's starry crown , and enduring life , and wisdom without measure , and wealth that none can count . Behold ! the great ones of the earth shall creep about thy feet , and its fair women shall cover up their eyes because of the shining glory of thy countenance , and its wise ones shall be abased before thee . Thou shalt read the hearts of men as an open writing , and hither and thither shalt thou lead them as thy pleasure listeth . Like that old Sphinx of Egypt shalt thou sit aloft from age to age , and ever shall they cry to thee to solve the riddle of thy greatness that doth not pass away , and ever shalt thou mock them with thy silence !
119577	119807	119149	119149	she	114	" Behold ! once more I kiss thee , and by that kiss I give to thee dominion over sea and earth , over the peasant in his hovel , over the monarch in his palace halls , and cities crowned with towers , and those who breathe therein . Where'er the sun shakes out his spears , and the lonesome waters mirror up the moon , where'er storms roll , and Heaven 's painted bows arch in the sky - from the pure North clad in snows , across the middle spaces of the world , to where the amorous South , lying like a bride upon her blue couch of seas , breathes in sighs made sweet with the odour of myrtles - there shall thy power pass and thy dominion find a home . Nor sickness , nor icy - fingered fear , nor sorrow , and pale waste of form and mind hovering ever o'er humanity , shall so much as shadow thee with the shadow of their wings . As a God shalt thou be , holding good and evil in the hollow of thy hand , and I , even I , I humble myself before thee . Such is the power of Love , and such is the bridal gift I give unto thee , Kallikrates , my Lord and Lord of All .
119808	119897	119906	119906	she	2761	" And now it is done ; now for thee I loose my virgin zone ; and come storm , come shine , come good , come evil , come life , come death , it never , never can be undone . For , of a truth , that which is , is , and , being done , is done for aye , and can not be altered . I have said - Let us hence , that all things may be accomplished in their order ; "
120452	120457	120458	120458	she	114	" It is well , "
120461	120497	120458	120458	she	114	" prepare to enter the very womb of the Earth , wherein she doth conceive the Life that ye see brought forth in man and beast - ay , and in every tree and flower . "
120851	120858	120860	120860	Ayesha	114	" Draw near , draw near ! "
120869	120988	120860	120860	Ayesha	114	" Behold the very Fountain and Heart of Life as it beats in the bosom of the great world . Behold the substance from which all things draw their energy , the bright Spirit of the Globe , without which it can not live , but must grow cold and dead as the dead moon . Draw near , and wash you in the living flames , and take their virtue into your poor frames in all its virgin strength - not as it now feebly glows within your bosoms , filtered thereto through all the fine strainers of a thousand intermediate lives , but as it is here in the very fount and seat of earthly Being . "
121487	121492	121493	121493	she	2790	" Now , Kallikrates , "
121496	121588	121493	121493	she	2790	" the mighty moment is at hand . When the great flame comes again thou must stand in it . First throw aside thy garments , for it will burn them , though thee it will not hurt . Thou must stand in the flame while thy senses will endure , and when it embraces thee suck the fire down into thy very heart , and let it leap and play around thy every part , so that thou lose no moiety of its virtue . Hearest thou me , Kallikrates ? "
121589	121596	121598	121598	Leo	108	" I hear thee , Ayesha , "
121600	121648	121649	121649	he	108	" but , of a truth - I am no coward - but I doubt me of that raging flame . How know I that it will not utterly destroy me , so that I lose myself and lose thee also ? Nevertheless will I do it , "
121662	121695	121652	121652	Ayesha	114	" It is not wonderful that thou shouldst doubt . Tell me , Kallikrates : if thou seest me stand in the flame and come forth unharmed , wilt thou enter also ? "
121696	121699	121700	121700	he	108	" Yes , "
121703	121722	121700	121700	he	108	" I will enter even if it slay me . I have said that I will enter now . "
121723	121730	121731	121731	I	0	" And that will I also , "
121734	121740	121741	121741	she	114	" What , my Holly ! "
121745	121762	121741	121741	she	114	" methought that thou wouldst naught of length of days . Why , how is this ? "
121763	121770	121771	121771	I	0	" Nay , I know not , "
121774	121793	121771	121771	I	0	" but there is that in my heart that calleth me to taste of the flame and live . "
121794	121799	121800	121800	she	114	" It is well , "
121803	121859	121800	121800	she	114	" Thou art not altogether lost in folly . See now , I will for the second time bathe me in this living bath . Fain would I add to my beauty and my length of days if that be possible . If it be not possible , at the least it can not harm me .
121860	121863	121864	121864	she	114	" Also , "
121872	122102	121864	121864	she	114	" is there another and a deeper cause why I would once again dip me in the flame . When first I tasted of its virtue full was my heart of passion and of hatred of that Egyptian Amenartas , and therefore , despite my strivings to be rid thereof , have passion and hatred been stamped upon my soul from that sad hour to this . But now it is otherwise . Now is my mood a happy mood , and filled am I with the purest part of thought , and so would I ever be . Therefore , Kallikrates , will I once more wash and make me pure and clean , and yet more fit for thee . Therefore also , when thou dost in turn stand in the fire , empty all thy heart of evil , and let soft contentment hold the balance of thy mind . Shake loose thy spirit 's wings , and take thy stand upon the utter verge of holy contemplation ; ay , dream upon thy mother 's kiss , and turn thee towards the vision of the highest good that hath ever swept on silver wings across the silence of thy dreams . For from the germ of what thou art in that dread moment shall grow the fruit of what thou shalt be for all unreckoned time .
122103	122151	121800	121800	she	114	" Now prepare thee , prepare ! even as though thy last hour were at hand , and thou wast to cross to the Land of Shadows , and not through the Gates of Glory into the realms of Life made beautiful . Prepare , I say ! "
122360	122369	122370	122370	she	114	" Oh , my love , my love ! "
122373	122384	122370	122370	she	114	" wilt thou ever know how I have loved thee ? "
123038	123046	123047	123047	she	114	" What is it , my Kallikrates ? "
123072	123083	123084	123084	she	114	" Why , what is it - what is it ? "
123088	123128	123130	123130	she	114	" I feel dazed . Surely the quality of the fire hath not altered . Can the principle of Life alter ? Tell me , Kallikrates , is there aught wrong with my eyes ? I see not clear , "
123157	123168	123170	123170	Job	137	" Oh , look ! - look ! - look ! "
123194	123215	123218	123218	he	137	" Look ! - look ! - look ! she 's shrivelling up ! she 's turning into a monkey ! "
123649	123652	123653	123653	she	114	" Kallikrates , "
123661	123700	123653	123653	she	114	" Forget me not , Kallikrates . Have pity on my shame ; I shall come again , and shall once more be beautiful , I swear it - it is true ! Oh - h - h - "
124522	124525	124518	124518	he	108	" Oh ! "
124686	124696	124697	124697	he	108	" What is to be done , old fellow ? "
124728	124737	124738	124738	I	0	" Try and get out , I suppose , "
124741	124754	124756	124756	I	0	" that is , unless you would like to go in there , "
124770	124785	124786	124786	he	108	" I would go in if I were sure that it would kill me , "
124793	124909	124786	124786	he	108	" It was my cursed hesitation that did this . If I had not been doubtful she might never have tried to show me the road . But I am not sure . The fire might have the opposite effect upon me . It might make me immortal ; and , old fellow , I have not the patience to wait a couple of thousand years for her to come back again as she did for me . I had rather die when my hour comes - and I should fancy that it is n't far off either - and go my ways to look for her . Do you go in if you like . "
124992	124998	124999	124999	I	0	" Well , my boy , "
125002	125017	124999	124999	I	0	" we can not stop here till we go the way of those two , "
125038	125063	125019	125019	I	0	" If we are going we had better go . But , by the way , I expect that the lamps have burnt out , "
125080	125090	125092	125092	Leo	108	" There is some more oil in the vase , "
125095	125105	125092	125092	Leo	108	" if it is not broken , at least . "
125188	125197	125199	125199	Leo	108	" Let 's see it come once more , "
125201	125214	125199	125199	Leo	108	" we shall never look upon its like again in this world . "
125506	125516	125517	125517	he	108	" She called to me not to forget her , "
125521	125586	125517	125517	he	108	" and swore that we should meet again . By Heaven ! I never will forget her . Here I swear that if we live to get out of this , I will not for all my days have anything to say to another living woman , and that wherever I go I will wait for her as faithfully as she waited for me . "
125587	125590	125591	125591	I	0	" Yes , "
125596	125616	125591	125591	I	0	" if she comes back as beautiful as we knew her . But supposing she came back like that ! "
127770	127775	127777	127777	Leo	108	" Now for it , "
127779	127784	127777	127777	Leo	108	" now or never . "
127856	127863	127865	127865	I.	0	" Who is to go first ? "
127866	127873	127875	127875	Leo	108	" Do you , old fellow , "
127877	127915	127875	127875	Leo	108	" I will sit upon the other side of the stone to steady it . You must take as much run as you can , and jump high ; and God have mercy on us , say I. "
127990	127998	127999	127999	I	0	" Good - bye , my boy , "
128002	128019	127999	127999	I	0	" I hope that we shall meet again , wherever it is that we go to . "
128586	128596	128597	128597	he	108	" You must let go and swing yourself clear , "
128606	128628	128597	128597	he	108	" and then I will try and pull you up , or we will both go together . Are you ready ? "
129353	129360	129361	129361	I	0	" One more effort , Leo , "
129364	129388	129361	129361	I	0	" and we shall reach the slope where Billali is , if he has n't gone . Come , do n't give way , "
129792	129801	129802	129802	he	190	" Oh , my Baboon ! my Baboon ! "
129805	129856	129802	129802	he	190	" my dear son , is it indeed thee and the Lion ? Why , his mane that was ripe as corn is white like the snow . Whence come ye ? and where is the Pig , and where too She - who - must - be - obeyed ? "
129857	129863	129864	129864	I	0	" Dead , both dead , "
129867	129913	129864	129864	I	0	" but ask no questions ; help us , and give us food and water , or we too shall die before thine eyes . Seest thou not that our tongues are black for want of water ? How , then , can we talk ? "
129914	129917	129918	129918	he	190	" Dead ! "
129921	129936	129918	129918	he	190	" Impossible . She who never dies - dead , how can it be ? "
130261	130270	130272	130273	old Billali	190	" Thou hast slept long , my Baboon , "
130275	130282	130283	130283	I	0	" How long , my father ? "
130286	130319	130272	130273	old Billali	190	" A round of the sun and a round of the moon , a day and a night hast thou slept , and the Lion also . See , he sleepeth yet . "
130320	130325	130326	130326	I	0	" Blessed is sleep , "
130329	130336	130326	130326	I	0	" for it swallows up recollection . "
130337	130341	130342	130342	he	190	" Tell me , "
130345	130509	130342	130342	he	190	" what hath befallen you , and what is this strange story of the death of Her who dieth not . Bethink thee , my son : if this be true , then is thy danger and the danger of the Lion very great - nay , almost is the pot red wherewith ye shall be potted , and the stomachs of those who shall eat ye are already hungry for the feast . Knowest thou not that these Amahagger , my children , these dwellers in the caves , hate ye ? They hate ye as strangers , they hate ye more because of their brethren whom She put to the torment for your sake . Assuredly , if once they learn that there is naught to fear from Hiya , from the terrible One - who - must - be - obeyed , they will slay ye by the pot . But let me hear thy tale , my poor Baboon . "
130748	130752	130754	130754	Billali	190	" And now , "
130756	130765	130754	130754	Billali	190	" what wouldst thou do , my Baboon ? "
130766	130769	130770	130770	I	0	" Nay , "
130773	130789	130770	130770	I	0	" I know not , my father . Can we not escape from this country ? "
130795	130802	130792	130792	his	190	" It is very difficult . By K"r
130829	130850	130818	130820	those fierce ones	2945	" and he smiled significantly , and made a movement as though he were placing a hat on his head . "
130936	130936	130932	130932	ye	0	"
130937	130940	130941	130941	I	0	" Billali , "
130944	131042	130941	130941	I	0	" once , thou knowest , I did save thy life . Now pay back the debt , my father , and save me mine and my friend 's , the Lion 's . It shall be a pleasant thing for thee to think of when thine hour comes , and something to set in the scale against the evil doing of thy days , if perchance thou hast done any evil . Also , if thou be right , and if She doth but hide herself , surely when she comes again she shall reward thee . "
131043	131049	131051	131053	the old man	910	" My son the Baboon , "
131055	131231	131051	131053	the old man	910	" think not that I have an ungrateful heart . Well do I remember how thou didst rescue me when those dogs stood by to see me drown . Measure for measure will I give thee , and if thou canst be saved , surely I will save thee . Listen : by dawn to - morrow be prepared , for litters shall be here to bear ye away across the mountains , and through the marshes beyond . This will I do , saying that it is the word of She that it be done , and he who obeyeth not the word of She food is he for the hyænas . Then when ye have crossed the marshes , ye must strike with your own hands , so that perchance , if good fortune go with you , ye may live to come to that black water whereof ye told me . And now , see , the Lion wakes , and ye must eat the food I have made ready for you . "
131695	131742	131691	131695	the old inhabitants of K"r	4758	K"r . The Amahagger say they drive their spare cattle over it once a year to pasture outside ; all I know is that those cattle must be uncommonly active on their feet . Of course the litters were useless here , so we had to walk .
131774	131935	131691	131695	the old inhabitants of K"r	4758	K"r , in the centre of which we could clearly make out the pillared ruins of the Temple of Truth to the one side , and the boundless and melancholy marsh on the other . This wall of rock , which had no doubt once formed the lip of the crater , was about a mile and a half thick , and still covered with clinker . Nothing grew there , and the only thing to relieve our eyes were occasional pools of rain - water for rain had lately fallen wherever there was a little hollow . Over the flat crest of this mighty rampart we went , and then came the descent , which , if not so difficult a matter as the getting up , was still sufficiently break - neck , and took us till sunset . That night , however , we camped in safety upon the mighty slopes that rolled away to the marsh beneath .
132054	132062	132063	132063	he	190	" Farewell , my son the Baboon , "
132066	132159	132063	132063	he	190	" and farewell to thee too , oh Lion . I can do no more to help you . But if ever ye come to your country , be advised , and venture no more into lands that ye know not , lest ye come back no more , but leave your white bones to mark the limit of your journeyings . Farewell once more ; often shall I think of you , nor wilt thou forget me , my Baboon , for though thy face is ugly thy heart is true . "
132257	132330	132358	132358	Leo	183	K"r , and now two of us were dead , and the other two had gone through adventures and experiences so strange and terrible that death himself hath not a more fearful countenance . Three weeks - and only three weeks ! Truly time should be measured by events , and not by the lapse of hours . It seemed like thirty years since we saw the last of our whale - boat .
132331	132342	132343	132343	I	0	" We must strike out for the Zambesi , Leo , "
132346	132357	132343	132343	I	0	" but God knows if we shall ever get there . "
132414	132415	132463	132463	I	0	K"r .
132736	132847	132708	132708	his	4214	K"r , and the very next day managed to catch one of the steamboats that run round the Cape to England . Our journey home was a prosperous one , and we set our foot on the quay at Southampton exactly two years from the date of our departure upon our wild and seemingly ridiculous quest , and I now write these last words with Leo leaning over my shoulder in my old room in my college , the very same into which some two - and - twenty years ago my poor friend Vincey came stumbling on the memorable night of his death , bearing the iron chest with him .
