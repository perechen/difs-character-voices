3044	3064	2810	2811	Her nurse	596	" You are not passing the comb straight through my hair , Harriet ; the line will be crooked . "
3065	3078	2810	2811	Her nurse	596	" Ay , you are ill to please . Does that suit ? "
3079	3093	2810	2811	Her nurse	596	" Pretty well . Where should I go now that I am dressed ? "

3329	3349	3324	3325	Mrs. Bretton	130	" I do n't know : she tastes nothing , and by her looks , she has not slept . "
3362	3386	3388	3389	Mrs. Bretton	130	" If she were to take a fancy to anybody in the house , she would soon settle ; but not till then , "

3916	3920	3922	3922	her	141	" It is ! "
4187	4214	4183	4183	he	629	" I could not help it , madam : I found it impossible to leave the country without seeing with my own eyes how she settled . "
4215	4222	4183	4183	he	629	" But you will unsettle her . "
4223	4236	4239	4239	he	629	" I hope not . And how is papa 's little Polly ? "
4258	4265	4271	4271	she	141	" How is Polly 's papa ? "
4476	4480	4473	4473	She	4206	" Kiss Polly . "
4588	4591	4592	4592	he	629	" Polly , "
4602	4641	4592	4592	he	629	" go into the hall ; you will see papa 's great - coat lying on a chair ; put your hand into the pockets , you will find a pocket- handkerchief there ; bring it to me . "
4823	4847	4848	4848	She	558	" Put papa 's chair here , and mine near it , between papa and Mrs. Bretton : I must hand his tea . "
4863	4877	4882	4882	she	558	" Be near me , as if we were at home , papa . "
4902	4927	4882	4882	she	558	" I always did it for you at home ; papa : nobody could do it as well , not even your own self . "
5052	5058	5059	5059	he	643	" She is my comfort ! "

5563	5575	5577	5578	his mother	534	" Mr. Home 's little girl , I suppose you mean , "
5580	5585	5587	5588	her son	532	" Indeed , ma'am , "
5590	5620	5587	5588	her son	532	" I consider your expression of the least ceremonious : Miss Home I should certainly have said , in venturing to speak of the gentlewoman to whom I allude . "
5621	5649	5577	5578	his mother	534	" Now , Graham , I will not have that child teased . Do n't flatter yourself that I shall suffer you to make her your butt . "
5650	5654	5656	5656	Graham	135	" Miss Home , "
5665	5696	5697	5697	She	534	" might I have the honour to introduce myself , since no one else seems willing to render you and me that service ? Your slave , John Graham Bretton . "
5734	5740	5723	5723	her	534	" How do you do ? "
5741	5772	5709	5709	She	534	" I have the honour to be in fair health , only in some measure fatigued with a hurried journey . I hope , ma'am , I see you well ? "
5773	5781	5723	5723	her	534	" Tor - rer - ably well , "
5858	5882	5852	5852	Graham	135	" I hope , ma'am , the present residence , my mother 's house , appears to you a convenient place of abode ? "
5883	5901	5838	5838	she	534	" Not par - tic - er - er - ly ; I want to go home . "
5902	5955	5838	5838	she	534	" A natural and laudable desire , ma'am ; but one which , notwithstanding , I shall do my best to oppose . I reckon on being able to get out of you a little of that precious commodity called amusement , which mamma and Mistress Snowe there fail to yield me . "
5956	5976	5838	5838	she	534	" I shall have to go with papa soon : I shall not stay long at your mother 's . "
5977	6013	5852	5852	Graham	135	" Yes , yes ; you will stay with me , I am sure . I have a pony on which you shall ride , and no end of books with pictures to show you . "
6014	6023	5838	5838	she	534	" Are you going to live here now ? "
6024	6038	5838	5838	she	534	" I am . Does that please you ? Do you like me ? "
6039	6042	5838	5838	she	534	" No . "
6043	6046	5838	5838	she	534	" Why ? "
6047	6053	5838	5838	she	534	" I think you queer . "
6054	6060	5838	5838	she	534	" My face , ma'am ? "
6061	6075	5838	5838	she	534	" Your face and all about you : You have long red hair . "
6076	6109	6111	6111	he	666	" Auburn hair , if you please : mamma , calls it auburn , or golden , and so do all her friends . But even with my ' long red hair ' "
6139	6151	6131	6131	he	666	" I can not possibly be queerer than is your ladyship . "
6152	6158	5838	5838	she	534	" You call me queer ? "
6159	6162	6131	6131	he	666	" Certainly . "
6167	6176	6131	6131	he	666	" I think I shall go to bed . "
6177	6205	5838	5838	she	534	" A little thing like you ought to have been in bed many hours since ; but you probably sat up in the expectation of seeing me ? "
6206	6211	5838	5838	she	534	" No , indeed . "
6212	6241	6131	6131	he	666	" You certainly wished to enjoy the pleasure of my society . You knew I was coming home , and would wait to have a look at me . "
6242	6254	5838	5838	she	534	" I sat up for papa , and not for you . "
6255	6278	6279	6279	She	667	" Very good , Miss Home . I am going to be a favourite : preferred before papa soon , I daresay . "
6356	6363	6365	6365	her	667	" For shame , Mr. Graham ! "
6369	6374	6365	6365	her	667	" put me down ! "
6383	6407	6380	6380	her	667	" I wonder what you would think of me if I were to treat you in that way , lifting you with my hand "
6412	6420	6409	6411	that mighty member	668	" as Warren lifts the little cat . "
6563	6578	6546	6546	she	141	" Papa , put me down ; I shall tire you with my weight . "
6597	6600	6546	6546	she	141	" papa 's "
6630	6633	6546	6546	she	141	" papa , "
6744	6760	6733	6733	her	145	" I ca n't attend to you ; I have other things to think about . "
6768	6771	6772	6772	Graham	135	" Business . "
6870	6875	6877	6877	she	145	" Pretty little dog ! "
6924	6928	6895	6895	she	145	" Nice picture ! "
6934	6942	6944	6944	Graham	135	" Well - you may have it , "
6978	6989	6970	6970	She	145	" You wo n't have it , then , Polly ? "
6990	6999	6946	6946	She	145	" I would rather not , thank you . "
7000	7017	7018	7018	She	145	" Shall I tell you what I will do with the picture if you refuse it ? "
7024	7034	7018	7018	She	145	" Cut it into strips for lighting the taper . "
7035	7038	6946	6946	She	145	" No ! "
7039	7044	6946	6946	She	145	" But I shall . "
7045	7051	7052	7052	Graham	135	" Please - do n't . "
7073	7077	7079	7079	he	135	" Here goes ! "
7086	7100	7079	7079	he	135	" Right through Fido 's head , and splitting little Harry 's nose . "
7101	7108	7061	7061	he	135	" No ! No ! NO ! "
7109	7123	7124	7124	She	145	" Then come to me . Come quickly , or it is done . "
7132	7140	7141	7141	he	135	" Now , will you have it ? "
7150	7153	7141	7141	he	135	" Please . "
7154	7161	7124	7124	She	145	" But I shall want payment . "
7162	7166	7141	7141	he	135	" How much ? "
7167	7171	7141	7141	he	135	" A kiss . "
7172	7181	7124	7124	She	145	" Give the picture first into my hand . "
7235	7244	7225	7225	She	145	" Papa - papa - send him away ! "
7245	7253	7255	7255	Graham	135	" I 'll not be sent away , "
7271	7280	7282	7282	he	135	" Then , I shall kiss the hand , "
7389	7397	7398	7398	she	141	" Papa , what is the matter ? "
7401	7410	7398	7398	she	141	" You had better ask him , Polly . "
7411	7416	7369	7369	She	141	" Is he hurt ? "
7420	7430	7432	7433	Mr. Home	134	" He makes a noise as if he were , "
7435	7438	7440	7440	Graham	135	" Mother , "
7444	7459	7440	7440	Graham	135	" I think you had better send for the doctor . Oh my eye ! "
7470	7480	7440	7440	Graham	135	" If I were to become blind - - ? "
7499	7529	7493	7493	She	141	" Let me see your eye : I did not mean to touch it , only your mouth ; and I did not think I hit so very hard . "
7539	7548	7534	7534	Her	141	" I am sorry ; I am sorry ! "
7557	7566	7568	7569	Mrs. Bretton	130	" Have done trying that child , Graham , "
7571	7580	7582	7583	Mr. Home	134	" It is all nonsense , my pet , "
7611	7625	7601	7601	she	141	" The naughtiest , rudest , worst , untruest person that ever was . "
7656	7670	7671	7671	she	141	" Could n't I pack my box and go with you , papa ? "
7680	7689	7675	7675	He	134	" Should I be a trouble to you ? "
7690	7695	7677	7677	his	134	" Yes , Polly . "
7696	7702	7677	7677	his	134	" Because I am little ? "
7703	7747	7675	7675	He	134	" Because you are little and tender . It is only great , strong people that should travel . But do n't look sad , my little girl ; it breaks my heart . Papa , will soon come back to his Polly . "
7748	7762	7677	7677	his	134	" Indeed , indeed , I am not sad , scarcely at all . "
7763	7777	7677	7677	his	134	" Polly would be sorry to give papa pain ; would she not ? "
7778	7783	7675	7675	He	134	" Sorrier than sorry . "
7784	7820	7677	7677	his	134	" Then Polly must be cheerful : not cry at parting ; not fret afterwards . She must look forward to meeting again , and try to be happy meanwhile . Can she do this ? "
7821	7826	7677	7677	his	134	" She will try . "
7827	7843	7675	7675	He	134	" I see she will . Farewell , then . It is time to go . "
7844	7851	7677	7677	his	134	" Now ? - just now ? "
7855	7910	7911	7911	Papa	140	" She held up quivering lips . Her father sobbed , but she , I remarked , did not . Having put her down , he shook hands with the rest present , and departed . When the street - door closed , she dropped on her knees at a chair with a cry - "
7913	7923	7911	7911	Papa	140	" It was low and long ; a sort of "
7930	8165	7926	7926	thou	688	" During an ensuing space of some minutes , I perceived she endured agony . She went through , in that brief interval of her infant life , emotions such as some never feel ; it was in her constitution : she would have more of such instants if she lived . Nobody spoke . Mrs. Bretton , being a mother , shed a tear or two . Graham , who was writing , lifted up his eyes and gazed at her . I , Lucy Snowe , was calm . The little creature , thus left unharassed , did for herself what none other could do - contended with an intolerable feeling ; and , ere long , in some degree , repressed it . That day she would accept solace from none ; nor the next day : she grew more passive afterwards . On the third evening , as she sat on the floor , worn and quiet , Graham , coming in , took her up gently , without a word . She did not resist : she rather nestled in his arms , as if weary . When he sat down , she laid her head against him ; in a few minutes she slept ; he carried her upstairs to bed . I was not surprised that , the next morning , the first thing she demanded was , "
8171	8268	8168	8169	Mr. Graham	135	" It happened that Graham was not coming to the breakfast - table ; he had some exercises to write for that morning 's class , and had requested his mother to send a cup of tea into the study . Polly volunteered to carry it : she must be busy about something , look after somebody . The cup was entrusted to her ; for , if restless , she was also careful . As the study was opposite the breakfast - room , the doors facing across the passage , my eye followed her . "
8274	8283	8271	8271	you	135	" she asked , pausing on the threshold . "
8286	8290	8271	8271	you	135	" said Graham . "
8303	8304	8294	8294	you	135	" "

8316	8317	8311	8311	you	135	" "
8321	8322	8311	8311	you	135	" "
8327	8360	8311	8311	you	135	" And she deposited the cup on the carpet , like a jailor putting a prisoner 's pitcher of water through his cell - door , and retreated . Presently she returned . "
8372	8373	8311	8311	you	135	" "
8390	8398	8385	8388	a kind little woman	690	" She came back to Mrs. Bretton . "
8409	8410	8411	8411	You	135	" "
8425	8794	8795	8795	You	694	" She selected a portion of whatever was best on the table ; and , ere long , came back with a whispered request for some marmalade , which was not there . Having got it , however , for Mrs. Bretton refused the pair nothing , Graham was shortly after heard lauding her to the skies ; promising that , when he had a house of his own , she should be his housekeeper , and perhaps - if she showed any culinary genius - his cook ; and , as she did not return , and I went to look after her , I found Graham and her breakfasting tete - a - tete - she standing at his elbow , and sharing his fare : excepting the marmalade , which she delicately refused to touch , lest , I suppose , it should appear that she had procured it as much on her own account as his . She constantly evinced these nice perceptions and delicate instincts . The league of acquaintanceship thus struck up was not hastily dissolved ; on the contrary , it appeared that time and circumstances served rather to cement than loosen it . Ill - assimilated as the two were in age , sex , pursuits , c. , they somehow found a great deal to say to each other . As to Paulina , I observed that her little character never properly came out , except with young Bretton . As she got settled , and accustomed to the house , she proved tractable enough with Mrs. Bretton ; but she would sit on a stool at that lady 's feet all day long , learning her task , or sewing , or drawing figures with a pencil on a slate , and never kindling once to originality , or showing a single gleam of the peculiarities of her nature . I ceased to watch her under such circumstances : she was not interesting . But the moment Graham 's knock sounded of an evening , a change occurred ; she was instantly at the head of the staircase . Usually her welcome was a reprimand or a threat . "
8812	8813	8806	8806	I	0	" "
8821	8822	8826	8826	you	694	" "
8838	8854	8855	8855	Polly	141	" peeping between the rails of the banister ; she could not look over them . "
8857	8858	8855	8855	Polly	141	" "
8863	8880	8855	8855	Polly	141	" such was one of her terms for him , adopted in imitation of his mother . "
8889	8903	8904	8905	Dr. Digby	148	" declared Graham , leaning against the passage - wall in seeming exhaustion . "
8906	8909	8904	8905	Dr. Digby	148	" the headmaster "
8930	8931	8904	8905	Dr. Digby	148	" "
8938	8939	8944	8944	Polly	141	" "
8962	8963	8964	8964	Your	694	" "
8978	8979	8964	8964	Your	694	" "
8996	8997	8999	8999	I	0	" "
9023	9024	9025	9025	I	0	" "
9033	9039	9027	9027	I	0	" sinking into a chair . "
9055	9126	9027	9027	I	0	" This being done , she descended warily , and not taking her eyes from the feeble Graham . Of course her approach always galvanized him to new and spasmodic life : the game of romps was sure to be exacted . Sometimes she would be angry ; sometimes the matter was allowed to pass smoothly , and we could hear her say as she led him up - stairs : "
9147	9267	9142	9142	you	697	" It was sufficiently comical to observe her as she sat beside Graham , while he took that meal . In his absence she was a still personage , but with him the most officious , fidgety little body possible . I often wished she would mind herself and be tranquil ; but no - herself was forgotten in him : he could not be sufficiently well waited on , nor carefully enough looked after ; he was more than the Grand Turk in her estimation . She would gradually assemble the various plates before him , and , when one would suppose all he could possibly desire was within his reach , she would find out something else : "
9270	9279	9142	9142	you	697	" she would whisper to Mrs. Bretton , - "
9300	9329	9292	9292	you	4221	" pointing to the sideboard cupboard . Mrs. Bretton , as a rule , disapproved of sweet cake at tea , but still the request was urged , - "
9364	9795	9798	9798	you	703	" Graham did like it very well , and almost always got it . To do him justice , he would have shared his prize with her to whom he owed it ; but that was never allowed : to insist , was to ruffle her for the evening . To stand by his knee , and monopolize his talk and notice , was the reward she wanted - not a share of the cake . With curious readiness did she adapt herself to such themes as interested him . One would have thought the child had no mind or life of her own , but must necessarily live , move , and have her being in another : now that her father was taken from her , she nestled to Graham , and seemed to feel by his feelings : to exist in his existence . She learned the names of all his schoolfellows in a trice : she got by heart their characters as given from his lips : a single description of an individual seemed to suffice . She never forgot , or confused identities : she would talk with him the whole evening about people she had never seen , and appear completely to realise their aspect , manners , and dispositions . Some she learned to mimic : an under - master , who was an aversion of young Bretton 's , had , it seems , some peculiarities , which she caught up in a moment from Graham 's representation , and rehearsed for his amusement ; this , however , Mrs. Bretton disapproved and forbade . The pair seldom quarrelled ; yet once a rupture occurred , in which her feelings received a severe shock . One day Graham , on the occasion of his birthday , had some friends - lads of his own age - to dine with him . Paulina took much interest in the coming of these friends ; she had frequently heard of them ; they were amongst those of whom Graham oftenest spoke . After dinner , the young gentlemen were left by themselves in the dining - room , where they soon became very merry and made a good deal of noise . Chancing to pass through the hall , I found Paulina sitting alone on the lowest step of the staircase , her eyes fixed on the glossy panels of the dining - room door , where the reflection of the hall - lamp was shining ; her little brow knit in anxious , meditation . "
9804	9805	9798	9798	you	703	" "
9851	9852	9871	9871	you	703	" "
9859	9860	9861	9861	I	0	" "
9888	9943	9875	9875	I	0	" I thought perhaps they might not object to have her as a playmate , and therefore encouraged the attempt . She knocked - too faintly at first to be heard , but on a second essay the door unclosed ; Graham 's head appeared ; he looked in high spirits , but impatient . "
9953	9954	9946	9946	you	703	" "
9960	9961	9963	9963	you	703	" "
9991	10011	10014	10014	he	710	" The auburn head and bright flushed face vanished , - the door shut peremptorily . She was stunned . "
10024	10030	10018	10018	He	710	" she said in consternation . "
10036	10037	10033	10033	I	0	" "
10052	10053	10055	10055	he	710	" "
10071	10285	10062	10062	He	710	" I had some thoughts of consoling her , and of improving the occasion by inculcating some of those maxims of philosophy whereof I had ever a tolerable stock ready for application . She stopped me , however , by putting her fingers in her ears at the first words I uttered , and then lying down on the mat with her face against the flags ; nor could either Warren or the cook root her from that position : she was allowed to lie , therefore , till she chose to rise of her own accord . Graham forgot his impatience the same evening , and would have accosted her as usual when his friends were gone , but she wrenched herself from his hand ; her eye quite flashed ; she would not bid him good - night ; she would not look in his face . The next day he treated her with indifference , and she grew like a bit of marble . The day after , he teased her to know what was the matter ; her lips would not unclose . Of course he could not feel real anger on his side : the match was too unequal in every way ; he tried soothing and coaxing . "
10297	10375	10294	10294	he	712	" By - and - by tears answered him ; he petted her , and they were friends . But she was one on whom such incidents were not lost : I remarked that never after this rebuff did she seek him , or follow him , or in any way solicit his notice . I told her once to carry a book or some other article to Graham when he was shut up in his study . "
10384	10390	10376	10376	I	0	" said she , proudly ; "
10407	10495	10376	10376	I	0	" Young Bretton had a favourite pony on which he often rode out ; from the window she always watched his departure and return . It was her ambition to be permitted to have a ride round the courtyard on this pony ; but far be it from her to ask such a favour . One day she descended to the yard to watch him dismount ; as she leaned against the gate , the longing wish for the indulgence of a ride glittered in her eye . "
10506	10522	10501	10501	you	141	" asked Graham , half carelessly . I suppose she thought he was too careless . "
10528	10539	10526	10526	you	712	" said she , turning away with the utmost coolness . "
10544	10548	10540	10540	You	141	" pursued he . "
10558	10559	10554	10554	I	0	" "
10571	10576	10554	10554	I	0	" was the response . "
10593	10594	10582	10582	You	141	" "
10602	10643	10644	10644	Mamma	150	" I heard her say her imperfect articulation was the least precocious thing she had about her ; and with this ; she walked into the house . Graham , coming in soon after , observed to his mother , - "
10683	10684	10670	10670	she	142	" "
10688	10715	10670	10670	she	142	" said Paulina to me she had now got into the habit of occasionally chatting with me when we were alone in our room at night , "
10730	10731	10725	10725	I	0	" "
10759	10760	10767	10767	you	142	" "
10807	11018	10794	10794	he	135	" This observation was not altogether groundless : going to church , c. , kept Graham quiet on the Sunday , and the evening he generally dedicated to a serene , though rather indolent sort of enjoyment by the parlour fireside . He would take possession of the couch , and then he would call Polly . Graham was a boy not quite as other boys are ; all his delight did not lie in action : he was capable of some intervals of contemplation ; he could take a pleasure too in reading , nor was his selection of books wholly indiscriminate : there were glimmerings of characteristic preference , and even of instinctive taste in the choice . He rarely , it is true , remarked on what he read , but I have seen him sit and think of it . Polly , being near him , kneeling on a little cushion or the carpet , a conversation would begin in murmurs , not inaudible , though subdued . I caught a snatch of their tenor now and then ; and , in truth , some influence better and finer than that of every day , seemed to soothe Graham at such times into no ungentle mood . "
11029	11030	11027	11027	Polly	141	" "
11048	11049	11044	11044	I	0	" "
11062	11218	11044	11044	I	0	" The hymn being rehearsed , or rather half - chanted , in a little singing voice , Graham would take exceptions at the manner , and proceed to give a lesson in recitation . She was quick in learning , apt in imitating ; and , besides , her pleasure was to please Graham : she proved a ready scholar . To the hymn would succeed some reading - perhaps a chapter in the Bible ; correction was seldom required here , for the child could read any simple narrative chapter very well ; and , when the subject was such as she could understand and take an interest in , her expression and emphasis were something remarkable . Joseph cast into the pit ; the calling of Samuel ; Daniel in the lions ' den ; - these were favourite passages : of the first especially she seemed perfectly to feel the pathos . "
11222	11232	11219	11220	Poor Jacob	716	" she would sometimes say , with quivering lips . "
11243	11248	11255	11255	I	0	" she once added - "
11264	11280	11255	11255	I	0	" and she re - opened the book , sought the verse , and read , "
11298	11434	11281	11281	I	0	" With these words she gathered Graham in her little arms , drawing his long - tressed head towards her . The action , I remember , struck me as strangely rash ; exciting the feeling one might experience on seeing an animal dangerous by nature , and but half - tamed by art , too heedlessly fondled . Not that I feared Graham would hurt , or very roughly check her ; but I thought she ran risk of incurring such a careless , impatient repulse , as would be worse almost to her than a blow . On : the whole , however , these demonstrations were borne passively : sometimes even a sort of complacent wonder at her earnest partiality would smile not unkindly in his eyes . Once he said : - "
11451	11452	11449	11449	Polly	141	" "
11460	11464	11455	11455	I	0	" said she ; "
11472	11553	11554	11554	I	0	" I was not long allowed the amusement of this study of character . She had scarcely been at Bretton two months , when a letter came from Mr. Home , signifying that he was now settled amongst his maternal kinsfolk on the Continent ; that , as England was become wholly distasteful to him , he had no thoughts of returning hither , perhaps , for years ; and that he wished his little girl to join him immediately . "
11563	11756	11557	11557	she	720	" said Mrs. Bretton , when she had read the letter . I wondered , too , and I took upon myself to communicate it . Repairing to the drawing - room - in which calm and decorated apartment she was fond of being alone , and where she could be implicitly trusted , for she fingered nothing , or rather soiled nothing she fingered - I found her seated , like a little Odalisque , on a couch , half shaded by the drooping draperies of the window near . She seemed happy ; all her appliances for occupation were about her ; the white wood workbox , a shred or two of muslin , an end or two of ribbon collected for conversion into doll - millinery . The doll , duly night- capped and night - gowned , lay in its cradle ; she was rocking it to sleep , with an air of the most perfect faith in its possession of sentient and somnolent faculties ; her eyes , at the same time , being engaged with a picture - book , which lay open on her lap . "
11760	11767	11757	11758	Miss Snowe	142	" said she in a whisper , "
11775	11798	11799	11799	Candace	155	" the doll , christened by Graham ; for , indeed , its begrimed complexion gave it much of an Ethiopian aspect - "
11950	11961	11936	11937	a missionary	731	" She showed a little coloured cut to that effect . "
11966	11970	11936	11937	a missionary	731	" she went on "
11973	11978	11936	11937	a missionary	731	" grammar was occasionally forgotten "
12152	12158	12159	12159	Polly	141	" Thus she rambled on . "
12161	12172	12159	12159	Polly	141	" I interrupted , ' should you like to travel ? "
12173	12178	12159	12159	Polly	141	" Not just yet , "
12184	12244	12159	12159	Polly	141	" but perhaps in twenty years , when I am grown a woman , as tall as Mrs. Bretton , I may travel with Graham . We intend going to Switzerland , and climbing Mount Blanck ; and some day we shall sail over to South America , and walk to the top of Kim - kim - borazo . "
12245	12262	12263	12263	Her	141	" But how would you like to travel now , if your papa was with you ? "
12285	12297	12299	12299	she	141	" Where is the good of talking in that silly way ? "
12301	12341	12299	12299	she	141	" Why do you mention papa ? What is papa to you ? I was just beginning to be happy , and not think about him so much ; and there it will be all to do over again ! "
12376	12386	12387	12387	I	0	" Now , Polly , are you not glad ? "
12415	12425	12406	12406	she	141	" Shall not you like to go to papa ? "
12426	12430	12431	12431	she	141	" Of course , "
12570	12579	12580	12580	she	141	" Tell him by - and - by , "
12583	12590	12580	12580	she	141	" tell him I am going . "
12653	12682	12689	12689	he	135	" Polly going ? What a pity ! Dear little Mousie , I shall be sorry to lose her : she must come to us again , mamma . "
12710	12713	12729	12729	her	744	" Little Mousie "
12936	12957	12928	12928	she	744	" I can not - can not sleep ; and in this way I can not - can not live ! "
12964	12972	12974	12974	she	744	" Dedful miz - er - y ! "
12981	12988	12974	12974	she	744	" Shall I call Mrs. Bretton ? "
12989	12995	12997	12997	her	744	" That is downright silly , "
13119	13131	13132	13132	I	0	" Would you like to bid Graham good - night again ? "
13135	13145	13146	13146	She	744	" He is not gone to his room yet . "
13180	13194	13195	13195	I	0	" She can not sleep without seeing and speaking to you once more , "
13198	13209	13195	13195	I	0	" She does not like the thought of leaving you . "
13210	13216	13218	13218	he	135	" I 've spoilt her , "
13238	13252	13218	13218	he	135	" Polly , you care for me more than for papa , now - "
13253	13267	13269	13269	her	744	" I do care for you , but you care nothing for me , "
13311	13338	13308	13308	I	0	" Paulina , you should not grieve that Graham does not care for you so much as you care for him . It must be so . "
13347	13380	13339	13339	Her	744	" Because he is a boy and you are a girl ; he is sixteen and you are only six ; his nature is strong and gay , and yours is otherwise . "
13381	13396	13308	13308	I	0	" But I love him so much ; he should love me a little . "
13397	13412	13308	13308	I	0	" He does . He is fond of you . You are his favourite . "
13413	13420	13339	13339	Her	744	" Am I Graham 's favourite ? "
13421	13432	13308	13308	I	0	" Yes , more than any little child I know . "
13444	13447	13448	13448	I	0	" But , "
13451	13482	13448	13448	I	0	" do n't fret , and do n't expect too much of him , or else he will feel you to be troublesome , and then it is all over . "
13483	13487	13488	13488	she	752	" All over ! "
13492	13509	13488	13488	she	752	" then I 'll be good . I 'll try to be good , Lucy Snowe . "
13516	13525	13526	13526	she	752	" Will he forgive me this one time ? "
13562	13568	13570	13570	she	752	" There is no future , "
13572	13592	13570	13570	she	752	" I am going . Shall I ever - ever - see him again , after I leave England ? "
13635	13644	13570	13570	she	752	" Do you like Graham , Miss Snowe ? "
13645	13654	13570	13570	she	752	" Like him ! Yes , a little . "
13655	13668	13613	13613	her	752	" Only a little ! Do you like him as I do ? "
13669	13681	13570	13570	she	752	" I think not . No : not as you do . "
13682	13689	13570	13570	she	752	" Do you like him much ? "
13690	13718	13570	13570	she	752	" I told you I liked him a little . Where is the use of caring for him so very much : he is full of faults . "
13719	13723	13570	13570	she	752	" Is he ? "
13724	13729	13570	13570	she	752	" All boys are . "
13730	13735	13570	13570	she	752	" More than girls ? "
13736	13769	13570	13570	she	752	" Very likely . Wise people say it is folly to think anybody perfect ; and as to likes and dislikes , we should be friendly to all , and worship none . "
13770	13777	13570	13570	she	752	" Are you a wise person ? "
13778	13791	13570	13570	she	752	" I mean to try to be so . Go to sleep . "
13792	13806	13570	13570	she	752	" I can not go to sleep . Have you no pain just here "
13816	13834	13570	13570	she	752	" when you think you shall have to leave Graham ; for your home is not here ? "
13835	13840	13842	13842	I	0	" Surely , Polly , "
13844	13879	13842	13842	I	0	" you should not feel so much pain when you are very soon going to rejoin your father . Have you forgotten him ? Do you no longer wish to be his little companion ? "
13886	13894	13895	13895	I	0	" Child , lie down and sleep , "
13898	13904	13906	13906	she	754	" My bed is cold , "
13908	13915	13906	13906	she	754	" I ca n't warm it . "
13923	13928	13929	13929	I	0	" Come to me , "
14010	14016	14018	14018	I	0	" A very unique child , "
14047	14092	14093	14093	She	754	" How will she get through this world , or battle with this life ? How will she bear the shocks and repulses , the humiliations and desolations , which books , and my own reason , tell me are prepared for all flesh ? "
14879	14888	14890	14890	she	158	" It will not be an easy life ; "
14893	14928	14890	14890	she	158	" for I require a good deal of attention , and you will be much confined ; yet , perhaps , contrasted with the existence you have lately led , it may appear tolerable . "
15039	15052	15053	15053	I	0	" My doubt is whether I should have strength for the undertaking , "
15056	15063	15065	15065	she	158	" That is my own scruple , "
15067	15077	15065	15065	she	158	" for you look a worn - out creature . "
15131	15141	15122	15122	I	0	" What else have you in view - anything ? "
15142	15154	15204	15204	her	158	" Nothing clear as yet : but I may find something . "
15155	15197	15122	15122	I	0	" So you imagine : perhaps you are right . Try your own method , then ; and if it does not succeed , test mine . The chance I have offered shall be left open to you for three months . "
15978	15985	15986	15986	I	0	" Oh , hush ! hush ! "
16176	16180	16181	16181	I	0	" Our globe , "
16212	16311	16202	16202	her	814	" I listened and trembled ; Miss Marchmont slept . About midnight , the storm in one half - hour fell to a dead calm . The fire , which had been burning dead , glowed up vividly . I felt the air change , and become keen . Raising blind and curtain , I looked out , and saw in the stars the keen sparkle of a sharp frost . Turning away , the object that met my eyes was Miss Marchmont awake , lifting her head from the pillow , and regarding me with unusual earnestness . "
16318	16328	16329	16329	I	0	" she asked . I replied in the affirmative . "
16333	16337	16329	16329	I	0	" she said ; "
16357	16361	16350	16350	I	0	" she continued : "
16397	16398	16458	16458	she	815	" "
16408	16448	16458	16458	she	815	" I thought to myself , and wondered to hear her talk so . She went on directing her conversation to the past , and seeming to recall its incidents , scenes , and personages , with singular vividness . "
16449	16457	16458	16458	she	815	" I love Memory to - night , "
16461	16858	16458	16458	she	815	" I prize her as my best friend . She is just now giving me a deep delight : she is bringing back to my heart , in warm and beautiful life , realities - not mere empty ideas , but what were once realities , and that I long have thought decayed , dissolved , mixed in with grave - mould . I possess just now the hours , the thoughts , the hopes of my youth . I renew the love of my life - its only love - almost its only affection ; for I am not a particularly good woman : I am not amiable . Yet I have had my feelings , strong and concentrated ; and these feelings had their object ; which , in its single self , was dear to me , as to the majority of men and women , are all the unnumbered points on which they dissipate their regard . While I loved , and while I was loved , what an existence I enjoyed ! What a glorious year I can recall - how bright it comes back to me ! What a living spring - what a warm , glad summer - what soft moonlight , silvering the autumn evenings - what strength of hope under the ice- bound waters and frost - hoar fields of that year 's winter ! Through that year my heart lived with Frank 's heart . O my noble Frank - my faithful Frank - my good Frank ! so much better than myself - his standard in all things so much higher ! This I can now see and say : if few women have suffered as I did in his loss , few have enjoyed what I did in his love . It was a far better kind of love than common ; I had no doubts about it or him : it was such a love as honoured , protected , and elevated , no less than it gladdened her to whom it was given . Let me now ask , just at this moment , when my mind is so strangely clear , - let me reflect why it was taken from me ? For what crime was I condemned , after twelve months of bliss , to undergo thirty years of sorrow ? "
16864	16871	16458	16458	she	815	" she continued after a pause : "
16930	16931	16932	16932	He	163	" "
16938	16946	16932	16932	He	163	" I inquired in a low voice . "
16951	16955	16932	16932	He	163	" she said , "
17159	17343	17344	17344	I	0	" Would he for once fail me ? No - not even for once ; and now he was coming - and coming fast - to atone for lost time . ' Frank ! you furious rider , ' I said inwardly , listening gladly , yet anxiously , to his approaching gallop , ' you shall be rebuked for this : I will tell you it is my neck you are putting in peril ; for whatever is yours is , in a dearer and tenderer sense , mine . ' There he was : I saw him ; but I think tears were in my eyes , my sight was so confused . I saw the horse ; I heard it stamp - I saw at least a mass ; I heard a clamour . Was it a horse ? or what heavy , dragging thing was it , crossing , strangely dark , the lawn . How could I name that thing in the moonlight before me ? or how could I utter the feeling which rose in my soul ? "
17381	17625	17371	17372	a man	823	" ' What is the matter ? ' I demanded . Thomas , my own servant , answered by saying sharply , ' Go into the house , madam . ' And then calling to another servant , who came hurrying from the kitchen as if summoned by some instinct , ' Ruth , take missis into the house directly . ' But I was kneeling down in the snow , beside something that lay there - something that I had seen dragged along the ground - something that sighed , that groaned on my breast , as I lifted and drew it to ms . He was not dead ; he was not quite unconscious . I had him carried in ; I refused to be ordered about and thrust from him . I was quite collected enough , not only to be my own mistress but the mistress of others . They had begun by trying to treat me like a child , as they always do with people struck by God 's hand ; but I gave place to none except the surgeon ; and when he had done what he could , I took my dying Frank to myself . He had strength to fold me in his arms ; he had power to speak my name ; he heard me as I prayed over him very softly ; he felt me as I tenderly and fondly comforted him . "
17666	17670	17671	17671	she	826	" And that , "
17675	17738	17671	17671	she	826	" happened thirty years ago . I have suffered since . I doubt if I have made the best use of all my calamities . Soft , amiable natures they would have refined to saintliness ; of strong , evil spirits they would have made demons ; as for me , I have only been a woe - struck and selfish woman . "
17739	17746	17747	17747	I	0	" You have done much good , "
17759	17882	17671	17671	she	826	" I have not withheld money , you mean , where it could assuage affliction . What of that ? It cost me no effort or pang to give . But I think from this day I am about to enter a better frame of mind , to prepare myself for reunion with Frank . You see I still think of Frank more than of God ; and unless it be counted that in thus loving the creature so much , so long , and so exclusively , I have not at least blasphemed the Creator , small is my chance of salvation . What do you think , Lucy , of these things ? Be my chaplain , and tell me . "
17906	18047	18048	18048	She	828	" Very right , my child . We should acknowledge God merciful , but not always for us comprehensible . We should accept our own lot , whatever it be , and try to render happy that of others . Should we not ? Well , to - morrow I will begin by trying to make you happy . I will endeavour to do something for you , Lucy : something that will benefit you when I am dead . My head aches now with talking too much ; still I am happy . Go to bed . The clock strikes two . How late you sit up ; or rather how late I , in my selfishness , keep you up . But go now ; have no more anxiety for me ; I feel I shall rest well . "
18702	18707	18729	18729	I	0	" Leave this wilderness , "
18714	18720	18729	18729	I	0	" and go out hence . "
18721	18724	18729	18729	I	0	" Where ? "
19281	19284	19286	19287	Mrs. Barrett	167	" and , "
19305	19961	19290	19290	she	167	" I stored up this piece of casual information , as careful housewives store seemingly worthless shreds and fragments for which their prescient minds anticipate a possible use some day . Before I left my old friend , she gave me the address of a respectable old - fashioned inn in the City , which , she said , my uncles used to frequent in former days . In going to London , I ran less risk and evinced less enterprise than the reader may think . In fact , the distance was only fifty miles . My means would suffice both to take me there , to keep me a few days , and also to bring me back if I found no inducement to stay . I regarded it as a brief holiday , permitted for once to work - weary faculties , rather than as an adventure of life and death . There is nothing like taking all you do at a moderate estimate : it keeps mind and body tranquil ; whereas grandiloquent notions are apt to hurry both into fever . Fifty miles were then a day 's journey for I speak of a time gone by : my hair , which , till a late period , withstood the frosts of time , lies now , at last white , under a white cap , like snow beneath snow . About nine o'clock of a wet February night I reached London . My reader , I know , is one who would not thank me for an elaborate reproduction of poetic first impressions ; and it is well , inasmuch as I had neither time nor mood to cherish such ; arriving as I did late , on a dark , raw , and rainy evening , in a Babylon and a wilderness , of which the vastness and the strangeness tried to the utmost any powers of clear thought and steady self - possession with which , in the absence of more brilliant faculties , Nature might have gifted me . When I left the coach , the strange speech of the cabmen and others waiting round , seemed to me odd as a foreign tongue . I had never before heard the English language chopped up in that way . However , I managed to understand and to be understood , so far as to get myself and trunk safely conveyed to the old inn whereof I had the address . How difficult , how oppressive , how puzzling seemed my flight ! In London for the first time ; at an inn for the first time ; tired with travelling ; confused with darkness ; palsied with cold ; unfurnished with either experience or advice to tell me how to act , and yet - to act obliged . Into the hands of common sense I confided the matter . Common sense , however , was as chilled and bewildered as all my other faculties , and it was only under the spur of an inexorable necessity that she spasmodically executed her trust . Thus urged , she paid the porter : considering the crisis , I did not blame her too much that she was hugely cheated ; she asked the waiter for a room ; she timorously called for the chambermaid ; what is far more , she bore , without being wholly overcome , a highly supercilious style of demeanour from that young lady , when she appeared . I recollect this same chambermaid was a pattern of town prettiness and smartness . So trim her waist , her cap , her dress - I wondered how they had all been manufactured . Her speech had an accent which in its mincing glibness seemed to rebuke mine as by authority ; her spruce attire flaunted an easy scorn to my plain country garb . "
19970	19974	19290	19290	she	167	" I thought , "
19991	20343	20344	20344	I	0	" Maintaining a very quiet manner towards this arrogant little maid , and subsequently observing the same towards the parsonic - looking , black- coated , white - neckclothed waiter , I got civility from them ere long . I believe at first they thought I was a servant ; but in a little while they changed their minds , and hovered in a doubtful state between patronage and politeness . I kept up well till I had partaken of some refreshment , warmed myself by a fire , and was fairly shut into my own room ; but , as I sat down by the bed and rested my head and arms on the pillow , a terrible oppression overcame me . All at once my position rose on me like a ghost . Anomalous , desolate , almost blank of hope it stood . What was I doing here alone in great London ? What should I do on the morrow ? What prospects had I in life ? What friends had I on , earth ? Whence did I come ? Whither should I go ? What should I do ? I wet the pillow , my arms , and my hair , with rushing tears . A dark interval of most bitter thought followed this burst ; but I did not regret the step taken , nor wish to retract it A strong , vague persuasion that it was better to go forward than backward , and that I could go forward - that a way , however narrow and difficult , would in time open - predominated over other feelings : its influence hushed them so far , that at last I became sufficiently tranquil to be able to say my prayers and seek my couch . I had just extinguished my candle and lain down , when a deep , low , mighty tone swung through the night . At first I knew it not ; but it was uttered twelve times , and at the twelfth colossal hum and trembling knell , I said : "
20354	20480	20344	20344	I	0	" CHAPTER VI . LONDON . The next day was the first of March , and when I awoke , rose , and opened my curtain , I saw the risen sun struggling through fog . Above my head , above the house - tops , co - elevate almost with the clouds , I saw a solemn , orbed mass , dark blue and dim - THE DOME . While I looked , my inner self moved ; my spirit shook its always - fettered wings half loose ; I had a sudden feeling as if I , who never yet truly lived , were at last about to taste life . In that morning my soul grew as fast as Jonah 's gourd . "
20487	20499	20481	20481	I	0	" I said , proceeding to dress with speed and care . "
20539	21535	21543	21543	ma'am	4221	" Being dressed , I went down ; not travel - worn and exhausted , but tidy and refreshed . When the waiter came in with my breakfast , I managed to accost him sedately , yet cheerfully ; we had ten minutes ' discourse , in the course of which we became usefully known to each other . He was a grey - haired , elderly man ; and , it seemed , had lived in his present place twenty years . Having ascertained this , I was sure he must remember my two uncles , Charles and Wilmot , who , fifteen , years ago , were frequent visitors here . I mentioned their names ; he recalled them perfectly , and with respect . Having intimated my connection , my position in his eyes was henceforth clear , and on a right footing . He said I was like my uncle Charles : I suppose he spoke truth , because Mrs. Barrett was accustomed to say the same thing . A ready and obliging courtesy now replaced his former uncomfortably doubtful manner ; henceforth I need no longer be at a loss for a civil answer to a sensible question . The street on which my little sitting - room window looked was narrow , perfectly quiet , and not dirty : the few passengers were just such as one sees in provincial towns : here was nothing formidable ; I felt sure I might venture out alone . Having breakfasted , out I went . Elation and pleasure were in my heart : to walk alone in London seemed of itself an adventure . Presently I found myself in Paternoster Row - classic ground this . I entered a bookseller 's shop , kept by one Jones : I bought a little book - a piece of extravagance I could ill afford ; but I thought I would one day give or send it to Mrs. Barrett . Mr. Jones , a dried - in man of business , stood behind his desk : he seemed one of the greatest , and I one of the happiest of beings . Prodigious was the amount of life I lived that morning . Finding myself before St. Paul 's , I went in ; I mounted to the dome : I saw thence London , with its river , and its bridges , and its churches ; I saw antique Westminster , and the green Temple Gardens , with sun upon them , and a glad , blue sky , of early spring above ; and between them and it , not too dense , a cloud of haze . Descending , I went wandering whither chance might lead , in a still ecstasy of freedom and enjoyment ; and I got - I know not how - I got into the heart of city life . I saw and felt London at last : I got into the Strand ; I went up Cornhill ; I mixed with the life passing along ; I dared the perils of crossings . To do this , and to do it utterly alone , gave me , perhaps an irrational , but a real pleasure . Since those days , I have seen the West End , the parks , the fine squares ; but I love the city far better . The city seems so much more in earnest : its business , its rush , its roar , are such serious things , sights , and sounds . The city is getting its living - the West End but enjoying its pleasure . At the West End you may be amused , but in the city you are deeply excited . Faint , at last , and hungry it was years since I had felt such healthy hunger , I returned , about two o'clock , to my dark , old , and quiet inn . I dined on two dishes - a plain joint and vegetables ; both seemed excellent : how much better than the small , dainty messes Miss Marchmont 's cook used to send up to my kind , dead mistress and me , and to the discussion of which we could not bring half an appetite between us ! Delightfully tired , I lay down , on three chairs for an hour the room did not boast a sofa . I slept , then I woke and thought for two hours . My state of mind , and all accompanying circumstances , were just now such as most to favour the adoption of a new , resolute , and daring - perhaps desperate - line of action . I had nothing to lose . Unutterable loathing of a desolate existence past , forbade return . If I failed in what I now designed to undertake , who , save myself , would suffer ? If I died far away from - home , I was going to say , but I had no home - from England , then , who would weep ? I might suffer ; I was inured to suffering : death itself had not , I thought , those terrors for me which it has for the softly reared . I had , ere this , looked on the thought of death with a quiet eye . Prepared , then , for any consequences , I formed a project . That same evening I obtained from my friend , the waiter , information respecting , the sailing of vessels for a certain continental port , Boue - Marine . No time , I found , was to be lost : that very night I must take my berth . I might , indeed , have waited till the morning before going on board , but would not run the risk of being too late . "
21545	21813	21538	21538	your	902	" counselled the waiter . I agreed with him , and having discharged my bill , and acknowledged my friend 's services at a rate which I now know was princely , and which in his eyes must have seemed absurd - and indeed , while pocketing the cash , he smiled a faint smile which intimated his opinion of the donor 's savoir - faire - he proceeded to call a coach . To the driver he also recommended me , giving at the same time an injunction about taking me , I think , to the wharf , and not leaving me to the watermen ; which that functionary promised to observe , but failed in keeping his promise : on the contrary , he offered me up as an oblation , served me as a dripping roast , making me alight in the midst of a throng of watermen . This was an uncomfortable crisis . It was a dark night . The coachman instantly drove off as soon as he had got his fare : the watermen commenced a struggle for me and my trunk . Their oaths I hear at this moment : they shook my philosophy more than did the night , or the isolation , or the strangeness of the scene . One laid hands on my trunk . I looked on and waited quietly ; but when another laid hands on me , I spoke up , shook off his touch , stepped at once into a boat , desired austerely that the trunk should be placed beside me - "
21817	21896	21538	21538	your	902	" - which was instantly done ; for the owner of the boat I had chosen became now an ally : I was rowed off . Black was the river as a torrent of ink ; lights glanced on it from the piles of building round , ships rocked on its bosom . They rowed me up to several vessels ; I read by lantern - light their names painted in great white letters on a dark ground . "
21900	21901	21538	21538	your	902	" "
21905	21906	21907	21908	The Consort	904	" "
21910	21911	21907	21908	The Consort	904	" "
21915	21922	21923	21925	The Vivid "	174	" were passed in turns ; but "
21925	22030	21923	21925	The Vivid "	174	" was my ship , and it seemed she lay further down . Down the sable flood we glided , I thought of the Styx , and of Charon rowing some solitary soul to the Land of Shades . Amidst the strange scene , with a chilly wind blowing in my face and midnight clouds dropping rain above my head ; with two rude rowers for companions , whose insane oaths still tortured my ear , I asked myself if I was wretched or terrified . I was neither . Often in my life have I been far more so under comparatively safe circumstances . "
22035	22038	21923	21925	The Vivid "	174	" said I. "
22053	22062	21923	21925	The Vivid "	174	" I could not tell how it was . "
22065	22081	21923	21925	The Vivid "	174	" started out , white and glaring , from the black night at last . - "
22086	22097	22083	22083	you	0	" said the waterman , and instantly demanded six shillings . "
22103	22187	21923	21925	The Vivid "	174	" I said . He drew off from the vessel and swore he would not embark me till I paid it . A young man , the steward as I found afterwards , was looking over the ship 's side ; he grinned a smile in anticipation of the coming contest ; to disappoint him , I paid the money . Three times that afternoon I had given crowns where I should have given shillings ; but I consoled myself with the reflection , "
22195	22196	22197	22197	They	906	" "
22202	22217	22197	22197	They	906	" said the steward exultingly when I got on board . I answered phlegmatically that "
22222	22296	22197	22197	They	906	" and went below . A stout , handsome , and showy woman was in the ladies ' cabin . I asked to be shown my berth ; she looked hard at me , muttered something about its being unusual for passengers to come on board at that hour , and seemed disposed to be less than civil . What a face she had - so comely - so insolent and so selfish ! "
22310	22315	22316	22316	I	0	" was my answer . "
22326	22378	22316	22316	I	0	" She complied , but sullenly . I took off my bonnet , arranged my things , and lay down . Some difficulties had been passed through ; a sort of victory was won : my homeless , anchorless , unsupported mind had again leisure for a brief repose . Till the "
22380	22521	22522	22522	Charlotte	127	" arrived in harbour , no further action would be required of me ; but then .... Oh ! I could not look forward . Harassed , exhausted , I lay in a half - trance . The stewardess talked all night ; not to me but to the young steward , her son and her very picture . He passed in and out of the cabin continually : they disputed , they quarrelled , they made it up again twenty times in the course of the night . She professed to be writing a letter home - she said to her father ; she read passages of it aloud , heeding me no more than a stock - perhaps she believed me asleep . Several of these passages appeared to comprise family secrets , and bore special reference to one "
22524	22666	22667	22668	the Watsons	177	" a younger sister who , from the bearing of the epistle , seemed to be on the brink of perpetrating a romantic and imprudent match ; loud was the protest of this elder lady against the distasteful union . The dutiful son laughed his mother 's correspondence to scorn . She defended it , and raved at him . They were a strange pair . She might be thirty - nine or forty , and was buxom and blooming as a girl of twenty . Hard , loud , vain and vulgar , her mind and body alike seemed brazen and imperishable . I should think , from her childhood , she must have lived in public stations ; and in her youth might very likely have been a barmaid . Towards morning her discourse ran on a new theme : "
22670	22706	22667	22668	the Watsons	177	" a certain expected family - party of passengers , known to her , it appeared , and by her much esteemed on account of the handsome profit realized in their fees . She said , "
22722	22748	22667	22668	the Watsons	177	" At dawn all were astir , and by sunrise the passengers came on board . Boisterous was the welcome given by the stewardess to the "
22751	22966	22967	22967	Her	910	" and great was the bustle made in their honour . They were four in number , two males and two females . Besides them , there was but one other passenger - a young lady , whom a gentlemanly , though languid- looking man escorted . The two groups offered a marked contrast . The Watsons were doubtless rich people , for they had the confidence of conscious wealth in their bearing ; the women - youthful both of them , and one perfectly handsome , as far as physical beauty went - were dressed richly , gaily , and absurdly out of character for the circumstances . Their bonnets with bright flowers , their velvet cloaks and silk dresses , seemed better suited for park or promenade than for a damp packet deck . The men were of low stature , plain , fat , and vulgar ; the oldest , plainest , greasiest , broadest , I soon found was the husband - the bridegroom I suppose , for she was very young - of the beautiful girl . Deep was my amazement at this discovery ; and deeper still when I perceived that , instead of being desperately wretched in such a union , she was gay even to giddiness . "
22970	22974	22967	22967	Her	910	" I reflected , "
22983	23340	22967	22967	Her	910	" And even while this thought was crossing my mind , as I stood leaning quiet and solitary against the ship 's side , she came tripping up to me , an utter stranger , with a camp - stool in her hand , and smiling a smile of which the levity puzzled and startled me , though it showed a perfect set of perfect teeth , she offered me the accommodation of this piece of furniture . I declined it of course , with all the courtesy I could put into my manner ; she danced off heedless and lightsome . She must have been good - natured ; but what had made her marry that individual , who was at least as much like an oil - barrel as a man ? The other lady passenger , with the gentleman - companion , was quite a girl , pretty and fair : her simple print dress , untrimmed straw - bonnet and large shawl , gracefully worn , formed a costume plain to quakerism : yet , for her , becoming enough . Before the gentleman quitted her , I observed him throwing a glance of scrutiny over all the passengers , as if to ascertain in what company his charge would be left . With a most dissatisfied air did his eye turn from the ladies with the gay flowers ; he looked at me , and then he spoke to his daughter , niece , or whatever she was : she also glanced in my direction , and slightly curled her short , pretty lip . It might be myself , or it might be my homely mourning habit , that elicited this mark of contempt ; more likely , both . A bell rang ; her father I afterwards knew that it was her father kissed her , and returned to land . The packet sailed . Foreigners say that it is only English girls who can thus be trusted to travel alone , and deep is their wonder at the daring confidence of English parents and guardians . As for the "
23344	23353	22967	22967	Her	910	" by some their intrepidity is pronounced masculine and "
23356	23378	22967	22967	Her	910	" others regard them as the passive victims of an educational and theological system which wantonly dispenses with proper ' surveillance . "
23468	23478	23462	23462	she	911	" Are you fond of a sea - voyage ? "
23508	23514	23516	23516	she	911	" Oh , how charming ! "
23518	23560	23516	23516	she	911	" I quite envy you the novelty : first impressions , you know , are so pleasant . Now I have made so many , I quite forget the first : I am quite blasee about the sea and all that . "
23567	23575	23576	23576	she	911	" Why do you laugh at me ? "
23592	23604	23576	23576	she	911	" Because you are so young to be blasee about anything . "
23605	23609	23576	23576	she	911	" I am seventeen "
23614	23626	23576	23576	she	911	" You hardly look sixteen . Do you like travelling alone ? "
23627	23662	23576	23576	she	911	" Bah ! I care nothing about it . I have crossed the Channel ten times , alone ; but then I take care never to be long alone : I always make friends . "
23663	23675	23576	23576	she	911	" You will scarcely make many friends this voyage , I think "
23697	23706	23708	23708	she	911	" Not of those odious men and women , "
23724	23725	23708	23708	she	911	" "
23728	23729	23708	23708	she	911	" "
23735	23736	23737	23737	I	0	" "
23755	23764	23765	23765	I	0	" She stared , then carelessly ran on : "
24067	24068	24060	24060	I	0	" "
24075	24079	24072	24072	you	0	" I inquired . "
24086	24106	24072	24072	you	0	" said she . Now , Miss Ginevra Fanshawe such was this young person 's name only substituted this word "
24108	24124	24057	24057	them	935	" in temporary oblivion of the real name . It was a habit she had : "
24126	24171	24072	24072	you	0	" came in at every turn in her conversation - the convenient substitute for any missing word in any language she might chance at the time to be speaking . French girls often do the like ; from them she had caught the custom . "
24174	24197	24072	24072	you	0	" however , I found in this instance , stood for Villette - the great capital of the great kingdom of Labassecour . "
24203	24207	24199	24199	you	0	" I asked . "
24231	24232	24226	24229	some nice English families	938	" "
24239	24240	24234	24234	you	0	" "
24243	24244	24245	24247	A good one	940	" "
24249	24250	24245	24247	A good one	940	" "
24316	24317	24309	24309	You	0	" "
24329	24330	24320	24320	I	0	" "
24335	24342	24320	24320	I	0	" Without waiting for an answer - "
24353	24354	24320	24320	I	0	" "
24374	24375	24320	24320	I	0	" "
24379	24382	24320	24320	I	0	" in consternation "
24389	24390	24320	24320	I	0	" "
24396	24401	24320	24320	I	0	" After a pause - "
24622	24623	24619	24619	you	0	" "
24630	24631	24619	24619	you	0	" "
24644	24645	24632	24632	You	0	" "
24650	24651	24632	24632	You	0	" "
24658	24665	24653	24653	I	0	" a pause and a yawn . "
24673	24674	24676	24676	you	0	" "
24678	24679	24676	24676	you	0	" "
24730	25243	25246	25246	her	967	" Down she went . It was not long before the other passengers followed her : throughout the afternoon I remained on deck alone . When I recall the tranquil , and even happy mood in which I passed those hours , and remember , at the same time , the position in which I was placed ; its hazardous - some would have said its hopeless - character ; I feel that , as - Stone walls do not a prison make , Nor iron bars - a cage , so peril , loneliness , an uncertain future , are not oppressive evils , so long as the frame is healthy and the faculties are employed ; so long , especially , as Liberty lends us her wings , and Hope guides us by her star . I was not sick till long after we passed Margate , and deep was the pleasure I drank in with the sea - breeze ; divine the delight I drew from the heaving Channel waves , from the sea - birds on their ridges , from the white sails on their dark distance , from the quiet yet beclouded sky , overhanging all . In my reverie , methought I saw the continent of Europe , like a wide dream - land , far away . Sunshine lay on it , making the long coast one line of gold ; tiniest tracery of clustered town and snow - gleaming tower , of woods deep massed , of heights serrated , of smooth pasturage and veiny stream , embossed the metal - bright prospect . For background , spread a sky , solemn and dark blue , and - grand with imperial promise , soft with tints of enchantment - strode from north to south a God - bent bow , an arch of hope . Cancel the whole of that , if you please , reader - or rather let it stand , and draw thence a moral - an alliterative , text - hand copy - Day - dreams are delusions of the demon . Becoming excessively sick , I faltered down into the cabin . Miss Fanshawe 's berth chanced to be next mine ; and , I am sorry to say , she tormented me with an unsparing selfishness during the whole time of our mutual distress . Nothing could exceed her impatience and fretfulness . The Watsons , who were very sick too , and on whom the stewardess attended with shameless partiality , were stoics compared with her . Many a time since have I noticed , in persons of Ginevra Fanshawe 's light , careless temperament , and fair , fragile style of beauty , an entire incapacity to endure : they seem to sour in adversity , like small beer in thunder . The man who takes such a woman for his wife , ought to be prepared to guarantee her an existence all sunshine . Indignant at last with her teasing peevishness , I curtly requested her "
25249	25361	25246	25246	her	967	" The rebuff did her good , and it was observable that she liked me no worse for it . As dark night drew on , the sea roughened : larger waves swayed strong against the vessel 's side . It was strange to reflect that blackness and water were round us , and to feel the ship ploughing straight on her pathless way , despite noise , billow , and rising gale . Articles of furniture began to fall about , and it became needful to lash them to their places ; the passengers grew sicker than ever ; Miss Fanshawe declared , with groans , that she must die . "
25368	25373	25366	25366	honey	968	" said the stewardess . "
25380	25572	25366	25366	honey	968	" Accordingly , in another quarter of an hour , a calm fell upon us all ; and about midnight the voyage ended . I was sorry : yes , I was sorry . My resting - time was past ; my difficulties - my stringent difficulties - recommenced . When I went on deck , the cold air and black scowl of the night seemed to rebuke me for my presumption in being where I was : the lights of the foreign sea - port town , glimmering round the foreign harbour , met me like unnumbered threatening eyes . Friends came on board to welcome the Watsons ; a whole family of friends surrounded and bore away Miss Fanshawe ; I - but I dared not for one moment dwell on a comparison of positions . Yet where should I go ? I must go somewhere . Necessity dare not be nice . As I gave the stewardess her fee - and she seemed surprised at receiving a coin of more value than , from such a quarter , her coarse calculations had probably reckoned on - I said , "
25594	25880	25366	25366	honey	968	" She not only gave me the required direction , but called a commissionaire , and bid him take charge of me , and - not my trunk , for that was gone to the custom - house . I followed this man along a rudely - paved street , lit now by a fitful gleam of moonlight ; he brought me to the inn . I offered him sixpence , which he refused to take ; supposing it not enough , I changed it for a shilling ; but this also he declined , speaking rather sharply , in a language to me unknown . A waiter , coming forward into the lamp - lit inn - passage , reminded me , in broken English , that my money was foreign money , not current here . I gave him a sovereign to change . This little matter settled , I asked for a bedroom ; supper I could not take : I was still sea - sick and unnerved , and trembling all over . How deeply glad I was when the door of a very small chamber at length closed on me and my exhaustion . Again I might rest : though the cloud of doubt would be as thick to - morrow as ever ; the necessity for exertion more urgent , the peril of destitution nearer , the conflict for existence more severe . CHAPTER VII . VILLETTE . I awoke next morning with courage revived and spirits refreshed : physical debility no longer enervated my judgment ; my mind felt prompt and clear . Just as I finished dressing , a tap came to the door : I said , "
25884	25899	25366	25366	honey	968	" expecting the chambermaid , whereas a rough man walked in and said , - "
25907	25908	25905	25905	Meess	187	" "
25911	25915	25905	25905	Meess	187	" I asked . "
25918	25937	25905	25905	Meess	187	" said he impatiently ; and as he half - snatched them from my hand , he added , "
25946	26445	26446	26446	Anglaise	189	" Fortunately it did turn out all right : he was from the custom - house . Where to go to get some breakfast I could not tell ; but I proceeded , not without hesitation , to descend . I now observed , what I had not noticed in my extreme weariness last night , viz . that this inn was , in fact , a large hotel ; and as I slowly descended the broad staircase , halting on each step for I was in wonderfully little haste to get down , I gazed at the high ceiling above me , at the painted walls around , at the wide windows which filled the house with light , at the veined marble I trod for the steps were all of marble , though uncarpeted and not very clean , and contrasting all this with the dimensions of the closet assigned to me as a chamber , with the extreme modesty of its appointments , I fell into a philosophizing mood . Much I marvelled at the sagacity evinced by waiters and chamber - maids in proportioning the accommodation to the guest . How could inn- servants and ship - stewardesses everywhere tell at a glance that I , for instance , was an individual of no social significance , and little burdened by cash ? They did know it evidently : I saw quite well that they all , in a moment 's calculation , estimated me at about the same fractional value . The fact seemed to me curious and pregnant : I would not disguise from myself what it indicated , yet managed to keep up my spirits pretty well under its pressure . Having at last landed in a great hall , full of skylight glare , I made my way somehow to what proved to be the coffee - room . It can not be denied that on entering this room I trembled somewhat ; felt uncertain , solitary , wretched ; wished to Heaven I knew whether I was doing right or wrong ; felt convinced that it was the last , but could not help myself . Acting in the spirit and with the calm of a fatalist , I sat down at a small table , to which a waiter presently brought me some breakfast ; and I partook of that meal in a frame of mind not greatly calculated to favour digestion . There were many other people breakfasting at other tables in the room ; I should have felt rather more happy if amongst them all I could have seen any women ; however , there was not one - all present were men . But nobody seemed to think I was doing anything strange ; one or two gentlemen glanced at me occasionally , but none stared obtrusively : I suppose if there was anything eccentric in the business , they accounted for it by this word "
26448	26461	26446	26446	Anglaise	189	" Breakfast over , I must again move - in what direction ? "
26466	26498	26499	26499	I	0	" said an inward voice ; prompted doubtless by the recollection of this slight sentence uttered carelessly and at random by Miss Fanshawe , as she bid me good - by : "
26533	27391	26519	26519	she	190	" Who Madame Beck was , where she lived , I knew not ; I had asked , but the question passed unheard : Miss Fanshawe , hurried away by her friends , left it unanswered . I presumed Villette to be her residence - to Villette I would go . The distance was forty miles . I knew I was catching at straws ; but in the wide and weltering deep where I found myself , I would have caught at cobwebs . Having inquired about the means of travelling to Villette , and secured a seat in the diligence , I departed on the strength of this outline - this shadow of a project . Before you pronounce on the rashness of the proceeding , reader , look back to the point whence I started ; consider the desert I had left , note how little I perilled : mine was the game where the player can not lose and may win . Of an artistic temperament , I deny that I am ; yet I must possess something of the artist 's faculty of making the most of present pleasure : that is to say , when it is of the kind to my taste . I enjoyed that day , though we travelled slowly , though it was cold , though it rained . Somewhat bare , flat , and treeless was the route along which our journey lay ; and slimy canals crept , like half - torpid green snakes , beside the road ; and formal pollard willows edged level fields , tilled like kitchen - garden beds . The sky , too , was monotonously gray ; the atmosphere was stagnant and humid ; yet amidst all these deadening influences , my fancy budded fresh and my heart basked in sunshine . These feelings , however , were well kept in check by the secret but ceaseless consciousness of anxiety lying in wait on enjoyment , like a tiger crouched in a jungle . The breathing of that beast of prey was in my ear always ; his fierce heart panted close against mine ; he never stirred in his lair but I felt him : I knew he waited only for sun - down to bound ravenous from his ambush . I had hoped we might reach Villette ere night set in , and that thus I might escape the deeper embarrassment which obscurity seems to throw round a first arrival at an unknown bourne ; but , what with our slow progress and long stoppages - what with a thick fog and small , dense rain - darkness , that might almost be felt , had settled on the city by the time we gained its suburbs . I know we passed through a gate where soldiers were stationed - so much I could see by lamplight ; then , having left behind us the miry Chaussee , we rattled over a pavement of strangely rough and flinty surface . At a bureau , the diligence stopped , and the passengers alighted . My first business was to get my trunk ; a small matter enough , but important to me . Understanding that it was best not to be importunate or over - eager about luggage , but to wait and watch quietly the delivery of other boxes till I saw my own , and then promptly claim and secure it , I stood apart ; my eye fixed on that part of the vehicle in which I had seen my little portmanteau safely stowed , and upon which piles of additional bags and boxes were now heaped . One by one , I saw these removed , lowered , and seized on . I was sure mine ought to be by this time visible : it was not . I had tied on the direction - card with a piece of green ribbon , that I might know it at a glance : not a fringe or fragment of green was perceptible . Every package was removed ; every tin - case and brown - paper parcel ; the oilcloth cover was lifted ; I saw with distinct vision that not an umbrella , cloak , cane , hat - box or band - box remained . And my portmanteau , with my few clothes and little pocket - book enclasping the remnant of my fifteen pounds , where were they ? I ask this question now , but I could not ask it then . I could say nothing whatever ; not possessing a phrase of speaking French : and it was French , and French only , the whole world seemed now gabbling around me . What should I do ? Approaching the conductor , I just laid my hand on his arm , pointed to a trunk , thence to the diligence - roof , and tried to express a question with my eyes . He misunderstood me , seized the trunk indicated , and was about to hoist it on the vehicle . "
27399	27412	27397	27397	you	975	" said a voice in good English ; then , in correction , "
27427	27444	27445	27445	Sir	976	" But I had heard the Fatherland accents ; they rejoiced my heart ; I turned : "
27447	27468	27445	27445	Sir	976	" said I , appealing to the stranger , without , in my distress , noticing what he was like , "
27491	27539	27542	27542	him	4628	" Without discriminating , for the moment , what sort of face it was to which my eyes were raised and on which they were fixed , I felt in its expression half - surprise at my appeal and half - doubt of the wisdom of interference . "
27552	27584	27544	27544	I	0	" said I. I do n't know whether he smiled , but he said in a gentlemanly tone - that is to say , a tone not hard nor terrifying , - "
27592	27641	27645	27645	he	4628	" I described it , including in my description the green ribbon . And forthwith he took the conductor under hand , and I felt , through all the storm of French which followed , that he raked him fore and aft . Presently he returned to me . "
27703	27704	27675	27675	he	4628	" "
27708	27740	27706	27706	you	4628	" said I : but my heart sank . Meantime what should I do ? Perhaps this English gentleman saw the failure of courage in my face ; he inquired kindly , "
27749	27750	27675	27675	he	4628	" "
27762	27871	27754	27754	I	0	" There was a little pause , in the course of which , as he turned more fully to the light of a lamp above him , I saw that he was a young , distinguished , and handsome man ; he might be a lord , for anything I knew : nature had made him good enough for a prince , I thought . His face was very pleasant ; he looked high but not arrogant , manly but not overbearing . I was turning away , in the deep consciousness of all absence of claim to look for further help from such a one as he . "
27880	27899	27754	27754	I	0	" he asked , stopping me . How thankful was I to be able to answer with truth - "
27908	27915	27754	27754	I	0	" for I had near twenty francs "
27950	27951	27952	27952	I	0	" "
27966	27970	27952	27952	I	0	" said he ; "
27987	28054	28055	28055	Your	0	" He tore a leaf from his pocket - book , wrote a few words and gave it to me . I did think him kind ; and as to distrusting him , or his advice , or his address , I should almost as soon have thought of distrusting the Bible . There was goodness in his countenance , and honour in his bright eyes . "
28069	28073	28055	28055	Your	0	" he continued ; "
28100	28193	28092	28092	I	0	" He moved on , and I followed him , through the darkness and the small soaking rain . The Boulevard was all deserted , its path miry , the water dripping from its trees ; the park was black as midnight . In the double gloom of trees and fog , I could not see my guide ; I could only follow his tread . Not the least fear had I : I believe I would have followed that frank tread , through continual night , to the world 's end . "
28196	28206	28092	28092	I	0	" said he , when the park was traversed , "
28271	28272	28695	28697	Pensionnat de Demoiselles	193	" "
28279	28283	28695	28697	Pensionnat de Demoiselles	193	" said I : "
28289	28694	28695	28697	Pensionnat de Demoiselles	193	" And we parted . The remembrance of his countenance , which I am sure wore a light not unbenignant to the friendless - the sound in my ear of his voice , which spoke a nature chivalric to the needy and feeble , as well as the youthful and fair - were a sort of cordial to me long after . He was a true young English gentleman . On I went , hurrying fast through a magnificent street and square , with the grandest houses round , and amidst them the huge outline of more than one overbearing pile ; which might be palace or church - I could not tell . Just as I passed a portico , two mustachioed men came suddenly from behind the pillars ; they were smoking cigars : their dress implied pretensions to the rank of gentlemen , but , poor things ! they were very plebeian in soul . They spoke with insolence , and , fast as I walked , they kept pace with me a long way . At last I met a sort of patrol , and my dreaded hunters were turned from the pursuit ; but they had driven me beyond my reckoning : when I could collect my faculties , I no longer knew where I was ; the staircase I must long since have passed . Puzzled , out of breath , all my pulses throbbing in inevitable agitation , I knew not where to turn . It was terrible to think of again encountering those bearded , sneering simpletons ; yet the ground must be retraced , and the steps sought out . I came at last to an old and worn flight , and , taking it for granted that this must be the one indicated , I descended them . The street into which they led was indeed narrow , but it contained no inn . On I wandered . In a very quiet and comparatively clean and well - paved street , I saw a light burning over the door of a rather large house , loftier by a story than those round it . This might be the inn at last . I hastened on : my knees now trembled under me : I was getting quite exhausted . No inn was this . A brass - plate embellished the great porte - cochere : "
28698	28709	28710	28711	Madame Beck	190	" was the inscription ; and beneath , a name , "
28713	28746	28710	28711	Madame Beck	190	" I started . About a hundred thoughts volleyed through my mind in a moment . Yet I planned nothing , and considered nothing : I had not time . Providence said , "
28755	28839	28710	28711	Madame Beck	190	" Fate took me in her strong hand ; mastered my will ; directed my actions : I rang the door - bell . While I waited , I would not reflect . I fixedly looked at the street- stones , where the door - lamp shone , and counted them and noted their shapes , and the glitter of wet on their angles . I rang again . They opened at last . A bonne in a smart cap stood before me . "
28846	29023	29024	29024	You	998	" I inquired . I believe if I had spoken French she would not have admitted me ; but , as I spoke English , she concluded I was a foreign teacher come on business connected with the pensionnat , and , even at that late hour , she let me in , without a word of reluctance , or a moment of hesitation . The next moment I sat in a cold , glittering salon , with porcelain stove , unlit , and gilded ornaments , and polished floor . A pendule on the mantel - piece struck nine o'clock . A quarter of an hour passed . How fast beat every pulse in my frame ! How I turned cold and hot by turns ! I sat with my eyes fixed on the door - a great white folding - door , with gilt mouldings : I watched to see a leaf move and open . All had been quiet : not a mouse had stirred ; the white doors were closed and motionless . "
29028	29162	29163	29163	You	998	" said a voice at my elbow . I almost bounded , so unexpected was the sound ; so certain had I been of solitude . No ghost stood beside me , nor anything of spectral aspect ; merely a motherly , dumpy little woman , in a large shawl , a wrapping - gown , and a clean , trim nightcap . I said I was English , and immediately , without further prelude , we fell to a most remarkable conversation . Madame Beck for Madame Beck it was - she had entered by a little door behind me , and , being shod with the shoes of silence , I had heard neither her entrance nor approach - Madame Beck had exhausted her command of insular speech when she said , "
29167	29244	29163	29163	You	998	" and she now proceeded to work away volubly in her own tongue . I answered in mine . She partly understood me , but as I did not at all understand her - though we made together an awful clamour anything like Madame 's gift of utterance I had not hitherto heard or imagined - we achieved little progress . She rang , ere long , for aid ; which arrived in the shape of a "
29247	29394	29163	29163	You	998	" who had been partly educated in an Irish convent , and was esteemed a perfect adept in the English language . A bluff little personage this maitresse was - Labassecourienne from top to toe : and how she did slaughter the speech of Albion ! However , I told her a plain tale , which she translated . I told her how I had left my own country , intent on extending my knowledge , and gaining my bread ; how I was ready to turn my hand to any useful thing , provided it was not wrong or degrading ; how I would be a child's - nurse , or a lady's - maid , and would not refuse even housework adapted to my strength . Madame heard this ; and , questioning her countenance , I almost thought the tale won her ear : "
29406	29420	29421	29421	She	999	" said she : ' sont - elles donc intrepides ces femmes la ! "
29496	29504	29506	29506	she	999	" Voila pour la priere du soir ! "
29574	29658	29566	29566	herself	999	" Be assured , madame , that by instantly securing my services , your interests will be served and not injured : you will find me one who will wish to give , in her labour , a full equivalent for her wages ; and if you hire me , it will be better that I should stay here this night : having no acquaintance in Villette , and not possessing the language of the country , how can I secure a lodging ? "
29659	29664	29666	29666	she	999	" It is true , "
29668	29678	29666	29666	she	999	" but at least you can give a reference ? "
29679	29682	29683	29683	She	999	" None . "
29755	29761	29763	29764	Madame Beck	190	" Who goes out now ? "
29771	29775	29777	29778	the teacher	1005	" M. Paul , "
29780	29794	29777	29778	the teacher	1005	" He came this evening to give a reading to the first class . "
29795	29812	29813	29814	The teacher	1005	" The very man I should at this moment most wish to see . Call him . "
29840	29844	29846	29846	Madame	190	" Mon cousin , "
29848	29869	29846	29846	Madame	190	" I want your opinion . We know your skill in physiognomy ; use it now . Read that countenance . "
29914	29919	29920	29920	he	1008	" I read it , "
29923	29929	29920	29920	he	1008	" Et qu'en dites vous ? "
29930	29937	29896	29896	he	1008	" Mais - bien des choses , "
29943	29948	29896	29896	he	1008	" Bad or good ? "
29949	29957	29959	29960	the diviner	1009	" Of each kind , without doubt , "

33042	33522	33036	33036	her	190	" and glide ghost - like through the house , watching and spying everywhere , peering through every keyhole , listening behind every door . After all , Madame 's system was not bad - let me do her justice . Nothing could be better than all her arrangements for the physical well - being of her scholars . No minds were overtasked : the lessons were well distributed and made incomparably easy to the learner ; there was a liberty of amusement , and a provision for exercise which kept the girls healthy ; the food was abundant and good : neither pale nor puny faces were anywhere to be seen in the Rue Fossette . She never grudged a holiday ; she allowed plenty of time for sleeping , dressing , washing , eating ; her method in all these matters was easy , liberal , salutary , and rational : many an austere English school - mistress would do vastly well to imitate her - and I believe many would be glad to do so , if exacting English parents would let them . As Madame Beck ruled by espionage , she of course had her staff of spies : she perfectly knew the quality of the tools she used , and while she would not scruple to handle the dirtiest for a dirty occasion - flinging this sort from her like refuse rind , after the orange has been duly squeezed - I have known her fastidious in seeking pure metal for clean uses ; and when once a bloodless and rustless instrument was found , she was careful of the prize , keeping it in silk and cotton- wool . Yet , woe be to that man or woman who relied on her one inch beyond the point where it was her interest to be trustworthy : interest was the master - key of Madame 's nature - the mainspring of her motives - the alpha and omega of her life . I have seen her feelings appealed to , and I have smiled in half - pity , half - scorn at the appellants . None ever gained her ear through that channel , or swayed her purpose by that means . On the contrary , to attempt to touch her heart was the surest way to rouse her antipathy , and to make of her a secret foe . It proved to her that she had no heart to be touched : it reminded her where she was impotent and dead . Never was the distinction between charity and mercy better exemplified than in her . While devoid of sympathy , she had a sufficiency of rational benevolence : she would give in the readiest manner to people she had never seen - rather , however , to classes than to individuals . "
33527	34371	33036	33036	her	190	" she opened her purse freely - against the poor man , as a rule , she kept it closed . In philanthropic schemes for the benefit of society at large she took a cheerful part ; no private sorrow touched her : no force or mass of suffering concentrated in one heart had power to pierce hers . Not the agony in Gethsemane , not the death on Calvary , could have wrung from her eyes one tear . I say again , Madame was a very great and a very capable woman . That school offered her for her powers too limited a sphere ; she ought to have swayed a nation : she should have been the leader of a turbulent legislative assembly . Nobody could have browbeaten her , none irritated her nerves , exhausted her patience , or over - reached her astuteness . In her own single person , she could have comprised the duties of a first minister and a superintendent of police . Wise , firm , faithless ; secret , crafty , passionless ; watchful and inscrutable ; acute and insensate - withal perfectly decorous - what more could be desired ? The sensible reader will not suppose that I gained all the knowledge here condensed for his benefit in one month , or in one half - year . No ! what I saw at first was the thriving outside of a large and flourishing educational establishment . Here was a great house , full of healthy , lively girls , all well - dressed and many of them handsome , gaining knowledge by a marvellously easy method , without painful exertion or useless waste of spirits ; not , perhaps , making very rapid progress in anything ; taking it easy , but still always employed , and never oppressed . Here was a corps of teachers and masters , more stringently tasked , as all the real head - labour was to be done by them , in order to save the pupils , yet having their duties so arranged that they relieved each other in quick succession whenever the work was severe : here , in short , was a foreign school ; of which the life , movement , and variety made it a complete and most charming contrast to many English institutions of the same kind . Behind the house was a large garden , and , in summer , the pupils almost lived out of doors amongst the rose - bushes and the fruit - trees . Under the vast and vine - draped berceau , Madame would take her seat on summer afternoons , and send for the classes , in turns , to sit round her and sew and read . Meantime , masters came and went , delivering short and lively lectures , rather than lessons , and the pupils made notes of their instructions , or did not make them - just as inclination prompted ; secure that , in case of neglect , they could copy the notes of their companions . Besides the regular monthly jours de sortie , the Catholic fete - days brought a succession of holidays all the year round ; and sometimes on a bright summer morning , or soft summer evening ; the boarders were taken out for a long walk into the country , regaled with gaufres and vin blanc , or new milk and pain bis , or pistolets au beurre rolls and coffee . All this seemed very pleasant , and Madame appeared goodness itself ; and the teachers not so bad but they might be worse ; and the pupils , perhaps , a little noisy and rough , but types of health and glee . Thus did the view appear , seen through the enchantment of distance ; but there came a time when distance was to melt for me - when I was to be called down from my watch - tower of the nursery , whence I had hitherto made my observations , and was to be compelled into closer intercourse with this little world of the Rue Fossette . I was one day sitting up - stairs , as usual , hearing the children their English lessons , and at the same time turning a silk dress for Madame , when she came sauntering into the room with that absorbed air and brow of hard thought she sometimes wore , and which made her look so little genial . Dropping into a seat opposite mine , she remained some minutes silent . Desiree , the eldest girl , was reading to me some little essay of Mrs. Barbauld 's , and I was making her translate currently from English to French as she proceeded , by way of ascertaining that she comprehended what she read : Madame listened . Presently , without preface or prelude , she said , almost in the tone of one making an accusation , "
34381	34382	34378	34379	a governess	897	" "
34387	34392	34393	34393	you	190	" said I smiling , "
34397	34398	34393	34393	you	190	" "
34413	34675	34401	34401	your	190	" I assured her it was . Again she became silent ; but looking up , as I took a pin from the cushion , I found myself an object of study : she held me under her eye ; she seemed turning me round in her thoughts - measuring my fitness for a purpose , weighing my value in a plan . Madame had , ere this , scrutinized all I had , and I believe she esteemed herself cognizant of much that I was ; but from that day , for the space of about a fortnight , she tried me by new tests . She listened at the nursery door when I was shut in with the children ; she followed me at a cautious distance when I walked out with them , stealing within ear - shot whenever the trees of park or boulevard afforded a sufficient screen : a strict preliminary process having thus been observed , she made a move forward . One morning , coming on me abruptly , and with the semblance of hurry , she said she found herself placed in a little dilemma . Mr. Wilson , the English master , had failed to come at his hour , she feared he was ill ; the pupils were waiting in classe ; there was no one to give a lesson ; should I , for once , object to giving a short dictation exercise , just that the pupils might not have it to say they had missed their English lesson ? "
34681	34685	34679	34679	Madame	4736	" I asked . "
34696	34697	34679	34679	Madame	4736	" "
34704	34909	34679	34679	Madame	4736	" said I ; for I knew the number , and with my usual base habit of cowardice , I shrank into my sloth like a snail into its shell , and alleged incapacity and impracticability as a pretext to escape action . If left to myself , I should infallibly have let this chance slip . Inadventurous , unstirred by impulses of practical ambition , I was capable of sitting twenty years teaching infants the hornbook , turning silk dresses and making children 's frocks . Not that true contentment dignified this infatuated resignation : my work had neither charm for my taste , nor hold on my interest ; but it seemed to me a great thing to be without heavy anxiety , and relieved from intimate trial : the negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach to happiness I expected to know . Besides , I seemed to hold two lives - the life of thought , and that of reality ; and , provided the former was nourished with a sufficiency of the strange necromantic joys of fancy , the privileges of the latter might remain limited to daily bread , hourly work , and a roof of shelter . "
34912	34934	34679	34679	Madame	4736	" said Madame , as I stooped more busily than ever over the cutting - out of a child 's pinafore , "
34939	34940	34679	34679	Madame	4736	" "
34948	34949	34946	34946	Madame	4736	" "
34962	35212	34958	34958	I	0	" And as Madame Beck did really want and was resolved to have me - as she had long been dissatisfied with the English master , with his shortcomings in punctuality , and his careless method of tuition - as , too , she did not lack resolution and practical activity , whether I lacked them or not - she , without more ado , made me relinquish thimble and needle ; my hand was taken into hers , and I was conducted down - stairs . When we reached the carre , a large square hall between the dwelling - house and the pensionnat , she paused , dropped my hand , faced , and scrutinized me . I was flushed , and tremulous from head to foot : tell it not in Gath , I believe I was crying . In fact , the difficulties before me were far from being wholly imaginary ; some of them were real enough ; and not the least substantial lay in my want of mastery over the medium through which I should be obliged to teach . I had , indeed , studied French closely since my arrival in Villette ; learning its practice by day , and its theory in every leisure moment at night , to as late an hour as the rule of the house would allow candle - light ; but I was far from yet being able to trust my powers of correct oral expression . "
35216	35221	34958	34958	I	0	" said Madame sternly , "
35229	35234	34958	34958	I	0	" I might have said "
35237	35382	34958	34958	I	0	" and gone back to nursery obscurity , and there , perhaps , mouldered for the rest of my life ; but looking up at Madame , I saw in her countenance a something that made me think twice ere I decided . At that instant she did not wear a woman 's aspect , but rather a man 's . Power of a particular kind strongly limned itself in all her traits , and that power was not my kind of power : neither sympathy , nor congeniality , nor submission , were the emotions it awakened . I stood - not soothed , nor won , nor overwhelmed . It seemed as if a challenge of strength between opposing gifts was given , and I suddenly felt all the dishonour of my diffidence - all the pusillanimity of my slackness to aspire . "
35386	35390	35384	35384	you	1125	" she said , "
35396	35427	34958	34958	I	0	" indicating with her hand , first , the small door of communication with the dwelling - house , and then the great double portals of the classes or schoolrooms . "
35431	35435	34958	34958	I	0	" I said . "
35438	35464	35535	35535	me	0	" pursued she , cooling as I warmed , and continuing the hard look , from very antipathy to which I drew strength and determination , "
35478	35496	35473	35473	you	1125	" She sneered slightly in saying this : nervous excitability was not much to Madame 's taste . "
35506	35517	35520	35520	you	1125	" I said , tapping the flag with my toe : "
35522	35530	35520	35520	you	1125	" I added , returning her look . "
35570	35574	35575	35575	I	0	" I said : "
35642	35643	35644	35644	They	1128	" "
35651	35655	35644	35644	They	1128	" said she . "
35674	35701	35672	35673	Miss Turner	212	" - a poor friendless English teacher , whom Madame had employed , and lightly discarded ; and to whose piteous history I was no stranger . "
35705	35711	35672	35673	Miss Turner	212	" said she , coolly . "
35758	35772	35747	35748	Miss Turner	212	" I made no reply , but advanced to the closed schoolroom door . "
35786	35790	35747	35748	Miss Turner	212	" said Madame . "
35804	36035	35736	35736	she	212	" I opened the door , let her pass with courtesy , and followed her . There were three schoolrooms , all large . That dedicated to the second division , where I was to figure , was considerably the largest , and accommodated an assemblage more numerous , more turbulent , and infinitely more unmanageable than the other two . In after days , when I knew the ground better , I used to think sometimes if such a comparison may be permitted , that the quiet , polished , tame first division was to the robust , riotous , demonstrative second division , what the English House of Lords is to the House of Commons . The first glance informed me that many of the pupils were more than girls - quite young women ; I knew that some of them were of noble family as nobility goes in Labassecour , and I was well convinced that not one amongst them was ignorant of my position in Madame 's household . As I mounted the estrade a low platform , raised a step above the flooring , where stood the teacher 's chair and desk , I beheld opposite to me a row of eyes and brows that threatened stormy weather - eyes full of an insolent light , and brows hard and unblushing as marble . The continental "
36037	36046	35747	35748	Miss Turner	212	" is quite a different being to the insular "
36048	36133	35736	35736	she	212	" of the same age and class : I never saw such eyes and brows in England . Madame Beck introduced me in one cool phrase , sailed from the room , and left me alone in my glory . I shall never forget that first lesson , nor all the under - current of life and character it opened up to me . Then first did I begin rightly to see the wide difference that lies between the novelist 's and poet 's ideal "
36136	36140	35747	35748	Miss Turner	212	" and the said "
36143	36242	35747	35748	Miss Turner	212	" as she really is . It seems that three titled belles in the first row had sat down predetermined that a bonne d'enfants should not give them lessons in English . They knew they had succeeded in expelling obnoxious teachers before now ; they knew that Madame would at any time throw overboard a professeur or maitresse who became unpopular with the school - that she never assisted a weak official to retain his place - that if he had not strength to fight , or tact to win his way , down he went : looking at "
36246	36912	35747	35748	Miss Turner	212	" they promised themselves an easy victory . Mesdemoiselles Blanche , Virginie , and Angelique opened the campaign by a series of titterings and whisperings ; these soon swelled into murmurs and short laughs , which the remoter benches caught up and echoed more loudly . This growing revolt of sixty against one , soon became oppressive enough ; my command of French being so limited , and exercised under such cruel constraint . Could I but have spoken in my own tongue , I felt as if I might have gained a hearing ; for , in the first place , though I knew I looked a poor creature , and in many respects actually was so , yet nature had given me a voice that could make itself heard , if lifted in excitement or deepened by emotion . In the second place , while I had no flow , only a hesitating trickle of language , in ordinary circumstances , yet - under stimulus such as was now rife through the mutinous mass - I could , in English , have rolled out readily phrases stigmatizing their proceedings as such proceedings deserved to be stigmatized ; and then with some sarcasm , flavoured with contemptuous bitterness for the ringleaders , and relieved with easy banter for the weaker but less knavish followers , it seemed to me that one might possibly get command over this wild herd , and bring them into training , at least . All I could now do was to walk up to Blanche - Mademoiselle de Melcy , a young baronne - the eldest , tallest , handsomest , and most vicious - stand before her desk , take from under her hand her exercise - book , remount the estrade , deliberately read the composition , which I found very stupid , and , as deliberately , and in the face of the whole school , tear the blotted page in two . This action availed to draw attention and check noise . One girl alone , quite in the background , persevered in the riot with undiminished energy . I looked at her attentively . She had a pale face , hair like night , broad strong eyebrows , decided features , and a dark , mutinous , sinister eye : I noted that she sat close by a little door , which door , I was well aware , opened into a small closet where books were kept . She was standing up for the purpose of conducting her clamour with freer energies . I measured her stature and calculated her strength She seemed both tall and wiry ; but , so the conflict were brief and the attack unexpected , I thought I might manage her . Advancing up the room , looking as cool and careless as I possibly could , in short , ayant l'air de rien , I slightly pushed the door and found it was ajar . In an instant , and with sharpness , I had turned on her . In another instant she occupied the closet , the door was shut , and the key in my pocket . It so happened that this girl , Dolores by name , and a Catalonian by race , was the sort of character at once dreaded and hated by all her associates ; the act of summary justice above noted proved popular : there was not one present but , in her heart , liked to see it done . They were stilled for a moment ; then a smile - not a laugh - passed from desk to desk : then - when I had gravely and tranquilly returned to the estrade , courteously requested silence , and commenced a dictation as if nothing at all had happened - the pens travelled peacefully over the pages , and the remainder of the lesson passed in order and industry . "
36916	36934	36935	36936	Ca ira	1137	" said Madame Beck , when I came out of class , hot and a little exhausted . "
36938	37360	36935	36936	Ca ira	1137	" She had been listening and peeping through a spy - hole the whole time . From that day I ceased to be nursery governess , and became English teacher . Madame raised my salary ; but she got thrice the work out of me she had extracted from Mr. Wilson , at half the expense . CHAPTER IX . ISIDORE . My time was now well and profitably filled up . What with teaching others and studying closely myself , I had hardly a spare moment . It was pleasant . I felt I was getting , on ; not lying the stagnant prey of mould and rust , but polishing my faculties and whetting them to a keen edge with constant use . Experience of a certain kind lay before me , on no narrow scale . Villette is a cosmopolitan city , and in this school were girls of almost every European nation , and likewise of very varied rank in life . Equality is much practised in Labassecour ; though not republican in form , it is nearly so in substance , and at the desks of Madame Beck 's establishment the young countess and the young bourgeoise sat side by side . Nor could you always by outward indications decide which was noble and which plebeian ; except that , indeed , the latter had often franker and more courteous manners , while the former bore away the bell for a delicately - balanced combination of insolence and deceit . In the former there was often quick French blood mixed with the marsh - phlegm : I regret to say that the effect of this vivacious fluid chiefly appeared in the oilier glibness with which flattery and fiction ran from the tongue , and in a manner lighter and livelier , but quite heartless and insincere . To do all parties justice , the honest aboriginal Labassecouriennes had an hypocrisy of their own , too ; but it was of a coarse order , such as could deceive few . Whenever a lie was necessary for their occasions , they brought it out with a careless ease and breadth altogether untroubled by the rebuke of conscience . Not a soul in Madame Beck 's house , from the scullion to the directress herself , but was above being ashamed of a lie ; they thought nothing of it : to invent might not be precisely a virtue , but it was the most venial of faults . "
37366	37818	36935	36936	Ca ira	1137	" formed an item of every girl 's and woman 's monthly confession : the priest heard unshocked , and absolved unreluctant . If they had missed going to mass , or read a chapter of a novel , that was another thing : these were crimes whereof rebuke and penance were the unfailing weed . While yet but half - conscious of this state of things , and unlearned in its results , I got on in my new sphere very well . After the first few difficult lessons , given amidst peril and on the edge of a moral volcano that rumbled under my feet and sent sparks and hot fumes into my eyes , the eruptive spirit seemed to subside , as far as I was concerned . My mind was a good deal bent on success : I could not bear the thought of being baffled by mere undisciplined disaffection and wanton indocility , in this first attempt to get on in life . Many hours of the night I used to lie awake , thinking what plan I had best adopt to get a reliable hold on these mutineers , to bring this stiff - necked tribe under permanent influence . In , the first place , I saw plainly that aid in no shape was to be expected from Madame : her righteous plan was to maintain an unbroken popularity with the pupils , at any and every cost of justice or comfort to the teachers . For a teacher to seek her alliance in any crisis of insubordination was equivalent to securing her own expulsion . In intercourse with her pupils , Madame only took to herself what was pleasant , amiable , and recommendatory ; rigidly requiring of her lieutenants sufficiency for every annoying crisis , where to act with adequate promptitude was to be unpopular . Thus , I must look only to myself . Imprimis - it was clear as the day that this swinish multitude were not to be driven by force . They were to be humoured , borne with very patiently : a courteous though sedate manner impressed them ; a very rare flash of raillery did good . Severe or continuous mental application they could not , or would not , bear : heavy demand on the memory , the reason , the attention , they rejected point - blank . Where an English girl of not more than average capacity and docility would quietly take a theme and bind herself to the task of comprehension and mastery , a Labassecourienne would laugh in your face , and throw it back to you with the phrase , - "
37834	38384	38385	38385	Mademoiselle	216	" A teacher who understood her business would take it back at once , without hesitation , contest , or expostulation - proceed with even exaggerated care to smoothe every difficulty , to reduce it to the level of their understandings , return it to them thus modified , and lay on the lash of sarcasm with unsparing hand . They would feel the sting , perhaps wince a little under it ; but they bore no malice against this sort of attack , provided the sneer was not sour , but hearty , and that it held well up to them , in a clear , light , and bold type , so that she who ran might read , their incapacity , ignorance , and sloth . They would riot for three additional lines to a lesson ; but I never knew them rebel against a wound given to their self - respect : the little they had of that quality was trained to be crushed , and it rather liked the pressure of a firm heel than otherwise . By degrees , as I acquired fluency and freedom in their language , and could make such application of its more nervous idioms as suited their case , the elder and more intelligent girls began rather to like me in their way : I noticed that whenever a pupil had been roused to feel in her soul the stirring of worthy emulation , or the quickening of honest shame , from that date she was won . If I could but once make their usually large ears burn under their thick glossy hair , all was comparatively well . By - and - by bouquets began to be laid on my desk in the morning ; by way of acknowledgment for this little foreign attention , I used sometimes to walk with a select few during recreation . In the course of conversation it befel once or twice that I made an unpremeditated attempt to rectify some of their singularly distorted notions of principle ; especially I expressed my ideas of the evil and baseness of a lie . In an unguarded moment , I chanced to say that , of the two errors ; I considered falsehood worse than an occasional lapse in church - attendance . The poor girls were tutored to report in Catholic ears whatever the Protestant teacher said . An edifying consequence ensued . Something - an unseen , an indefinite , a nameless - something stole between myself and these my best pupils : the bouquets continued to be offered , but conversation thenceforth became impracticable . As I paced the alleys or sat in the berceau , a girl never came to my right hand but a teacher , as if by magic , appeared at my left . Also , wonderful to relate , Madame 's shoes of silence brought her continually to my back , as quick , as noiseless and unexpected , as some wandering zephyr . The opinion of my Catholic acquaintance concerning my spiritual prospects was somewhat naively expressed to me on one occasion . A pensionnaire , to whom I had rendered some little service , exclaimed one day as she sat beside me : "
38395	38396	38385	38385	Mademoiselle	216	" "
38401	38402	36935	36936	Ca ira	1137	" "
38418	38419	38385	38385	Mademoiselle	216	" "

38445	38461	36935	36936	Ca ira	1137	" Isabelle was an odd , blunt little creature . She added , sotto voce : "
38482	39082	39083	39083	Isidore	190	" I laughed , as , indeed , it was impossible to do otherwise . Has the reader forgotten Miss Ginevra Fanshawe ? If so , I must be allowed to re - introduce that young lady as a thriving pupil of Madame Beck 's ; for such she was . On her arrival in the Rue Fossette , two or three days after my sudden settlement there , she encountered me with very little surprise . She must have had good blood in her veins , for never was any duchess more perfectly , radically , unaffectedly nonchalante than she : a weak , transient amaze was all she knew of the sensation of wonder . Most of her other faculties seemed to be in the same flimsy condition : her liking and disliking , her love and hate , were mere cobweb and gossamer ; but she had one thing about her that seemed strong and durable enough , and that was - her selfishness . She was not proud ; and - bonne d'enfants as I was - she would forthwith have made of me a sort of friend and confidant . She teased me with a thousand vapid complaints about school - quarrels and household economy : the cookery was not to her taste ; the people about her , teachers and pupils , she held to be despicable , because they were foreigners . I bore with her abuse of the Friday 's salt fish and hard eggs - with her invective against the soup , the bread , the coffee - with some patience for a time ; but at last , wearied by iteration , I turned crusty , and put her to rights : a thing I ought to have done in the very beginning , for a salutary setting down always agreed with her . Much longer had I to endure her demands on me in the way of work . Her wardrobe , so far as concerned articles of external wear , was well and elegantly supplied ; but there were other habiliments not so carefully provided : what she had , needed frequent repair . She hated needle- drudgery herself , and she would bring her hose , c. to me in heaps , to be mended . A compliance of some weeks threatening to result in the establishment of an intolerable bore - I at last distinctly told her she must make up her mind to mend her own garments . She cried on receiving this information , and accused me of having ceased to be her friend ; but I held by my decision , and let the hysterics pass as they could . Notwithstanding these foibles , and various others needless to mention - but by no means of a refined or elevating character - how pretty she was ! How charming she looked , when she came down on a sunny Sunday morning , well - dressed and well - humoured , robed in pale lilac silk , and with her fair long curls reposing on her white shoulders . Sunday was a holiday which she always passed with friends resident in town ; and amongst these friends she speedily gave me to understand was one who would fain become something more . By glimpses and hints it was shown me , and by the general buoyancy of her look and manner it was ere long proved , that ardent admiration - perhaps genuine love - was at her command . She called her suitor "
39085	39117	39083	39083	Isidore	190	" this , however , she intimated was not his real name , but one by which it pleased her to baptize him - his own , she hinted , not being "
39121	39133	39083	39083	Isidore	190	" Once , when she had been bragging about the vehemence of "
39136	39148	39134	39134	Isidore	190	" attachment , I asked if she loved him in return . "
39152	39156	39134	39134	Isidore	190	" said she : "
39178	39255	39256	39256	Isidore	190	" Finding that she carried the thing on longer than , from her very fickle tastes , I had anticipated , I one day took it upon me to make serious inquiries as to whether the gentleman was such as her parents , and especially her uncle - on whom , it appeared , she was dependent - would be likely to approve . She allowed that this was very doubtful , as she did not believe "
39257	39262	39264	39264	you	0	" had much money . "
39268	39272	39264	39264	you	0	" I asked . "
39276	39280	39264	39264	you	0	" said she . "
39293	39294	39264	39264	you	0	" "
39315	39316	39310	39310	I	0	" "
39344	39345	39348	39348	he	1139	" "
39366	39367	39368	39368	I	0	" "
39378	39381	39382	39382	He	1139	" said I. "
39446	39542	39545	39551	mais plutot bel homme que joli garcon	1141	" Wishing to get a more definite idea of this love - stricken M. Isidore ; whose position seemed to me of the least secure , I requested her to favour me with a personal description ; but she could not describe : she had neither words nor the power of putting them together so as to make graphic phrases . She even seemed not properly to have noticed him : nothing of his looks , of the changes in his countenance , had touched her heart or dwelt in her memory - that he was "
39553	39946	39947	39947	My	0	" was all she could assert . My patience would often have failed , and my interest flagged , in listening to her , but for one thing . All the hints she dropped , all the details she gave , went unconsciously to prove , to my thinking , that M. Isidore 's homage was offered with great delicacy and respect . I informed her very plainly that I believed him much too good for her , and intimated with equal plainness my impression that she was but a vain coquette . She laughed , shook her curls from her eyes , and danced away as if I had paid her a compliment . Miss Ginevra 's school - studies were little better than nominal ; there were but three things she practised in earnest , viz . music , singing , and dancing ; also embroidering the fine cambric handkerchiefs which she could not afford to buy ready worked : such mere trifles as lessons in history , geography , grammar , and arithmetic , she left undone , or got others to do for her . Very much of her time was spent in visiting . Madame , aware that her stay at school was now limited to a certain period , which would not be extended whether she made progress or not , allowed her great licence in this particular . Mrs. Cholmondeley - her chaperon - a gay , fashionable lady , invited her whenever she had company at her own house , and sometimes took her to evening - parties at the houses of her acquaintance . Ginevra perfectly approved this mode of procedure : it had but one inconvenience ; she was obliged to be well dressed , and she had not money to buy variety of dresses . All her thoughts turned on this difficulty ; her whole soul was occupied with expedients for effecting its solution . It was wonderful to witness the activity of her otherwise indolent mind on this point , and to see the much - daring intrepidity to which she was spurred by a sense of necessity , and the wish to shine . She begged boldly of Mrs. Cholmondeley - boldly , I say : not with an air of reluctant shame , but in this strain : - "
39994	39996	39992	39992	you	225	" The "
40000	40285	39992	39992	you	225	" yielded at first ; but finding that applications increased as they were complied with , she was soon obliged , like all Miss Fanshawe 's friends , to oppose resistance to encroachment . After a while I heard no more of Mrs. Cholmondeley 's presents ; but still , visiting went on , and the absolutely necessary dresses continued to be supplied : also many little expensive etcetera - gloves , bouquets , even trinkets . These things , contrary to her custom , and even nature - for she was not secretive - were most sedulously kept out of sight for a time ; but one evening , when she was going to a large party for which particular care and elegance of costume were demanded , she could not resist coming to my chamber to show herself in all her splendour . Beautiful she looked : so young , so fresh , and with a delicacy of skin and flexibility of shape altogether English , and not found in the list of continental female charms . Her dress was new , costly , and perfect . I saw at a glance that it lacked none of those finishing details which cost so much , and give to the general effect such an air of tasteful completeness . I viewed her from top to toe . She turned airily round that I might survey her on all sides . Conscious of her charms , she was in her best humour : her rather small blue eyes sparkled gleefully . She was going to bestow on me a kiss , in her school - girl fashion of showing her delights but I said , "
40308	40325	40327	40327	I	0	" - and so put her off at arm 's length , to undergo cooler inspection . "
40330	40335	40327	40327	I	0	" was her question . "
40338	40341	40327	40327	I	0	" said I. "

40434	40435	40436	40436	I	0	" "

40495	40511	40488	40488	she	223	" I did not choose to ask any further questions , but turned abruptly away . "
40519	40531	40479	40480	Mrs. Cholmondeley	223	" these were her familiar terms for me when we disagreed , "
40538	40539	40479	40480	Mrs. Cholmondeley	223	" "
40556	40567	40544	40544	I	0	" For an instant , she seemed taken by surprise . "

40708	40709	40710	40711	Other people	1151	" "
40718	40724	40710	40711	Other people	1151	" was her angry reply . "
40739	40740	40733	40733	you	0	" "
40828	40829	40835	40835	Fanshawe	179	" "
40837	40875	40835	40835	Fanshawe	179	" was announced by the portress , and away she tripped . This semi - mystery of the parure was not solved till two or three days afterwards , when she came to make a voluntary confession . "
40884	40888	40876	40876	You	0	" she began , "
40931	40932	40920	40920	I	0	" "
40935	40939	40920	40920	I	0	" I thought , "
40977	40978	40971	40971	you	0	" "
40981	41002	41008	41008	she	223	" she went on , drawing near and speaking in her most confidential and coaxing tone ; for my ' sulkiness "
41032	41303	41008	41008	she	223	" Ecoutez , chere grogneuse ! I will tell you all how and about it ; and you will then see , not only how right the whole thing is , but how cleverly managed . In the first place , I must go out . Papa himself said that he wished me to see something of the world ; he particularly remarked to Mrs. Cholmondeley , that , though I was a sweet creature enough , I had rather a bread - and - butter - eating , school - girl air ; of which it was his special desire that I should get rid , by an introduction to society here , before I make my regular debut in England . Well , then , if I go out , I must dress . Mrs. Cholmondeley is turned shabby , and will give nothing more ; it would be too hard upon uncle to make him pay for all the things I need : that you ca n't deny - that agrees with your own preachments . Well , but SOMEBODY who heard me quite by chance , I assure you complaining to Mrs. Cholmondeley of my distressed circumstances , and what straits I was put to for an ornament or two - somebody , far from grudging one a present , was quite delighted at the idea of being permitted to offer some trifle . You should have seen what a blanc - bec he looked when he first spoke of it : how he hesitated and blushed , and positively trembled from fear of a repulse . "
41304	41346	41008	41008	she	223	" That will do , Miss Fanshawe . I suppose I am to understand that M. Isidore is the benefactor : that it is from him you have accepted that costly parure ; that he supplies your bouquets and your gloves ? "
41347	41354	41356	41356	she	1155	" You express yourself so disagreeably , "
41358	41393	41356	41356	she	1155	" one hardly knows how to answer ; what I mean to say is , that I occasionally allow Isidore the pleasure and honour of expressing his homage by the offer of a trifle . "
41394	41471	41008	41008	she	223	" It comes to the same thing .... Now , Ginevra , to speak the plain truth , I do n't very well understand these matters ; but I believe you are doing very wrong - seriously wrong . Perhaps , however , you now feel certain that you will be able to marry M. Isidore ; your parents and uncle have given their consent , and , for your part , you love him entirely ? "
41472	41478	41479	41479	she	1155	" Mais pas du tout ! "
41495	41508	41479	41479	she	1155	" Je suis sa reine , mais il n'est pas mon roi . "
41509	41566	41008	41008	she	223	" Excuse me , I must believe this language is mere nonsense and coquetry . There is nothing great about you , yet you are above profiting by the good nature and purse of a man to whom you feel absolute indifference . You love M. Isidore far more than you think , or will avow . "
41567	41631	41633	41633	she	1156	" No . I danced with a young officer the other night , whom I love a thousand times more than he . I often wonder why I feel so very cold to Isidore , for everybody says he is handsome , and other ladies admire him ; but , somehow , he bores me : let me see now how it is .... "
41648	41651	41652	41652	I	0	" Yes ! "
41655	41685	41652	41652	I	0	" try to get a clear idea of the state of your mind . To me it seems in a great mess - chaotic as a rag - bag . "
41686	41694	41695	41695	she	1156	" It is something in this fashion , "
41701	41863	41695	41695	she	1156	" the man is too romantic and devoted , and he expects something more of me than I find it convenient to be . He thinks I am perfect : furnished with all sorts of sterling qualities and solid virtues , such as I never had , nor intend to have . Now , one ca n't help , in his presence , rather trying to justify his good opinion ; and it does so tire one to be goody , and to talk sense , - for he really thinks I am sensible . I am far more at my ease with you , old lady - you , you dear crosspatch - who take me at my lowest , and know me to be coquettish , and ignorant , and flirting , and fickle , and silly , and selfish , and all the other sweet things you and I have agreed to be a part of my character . "
41864	41871	41872	41872	I	0	" This is all very well , "
41896	41927	41872	41872	I	0	" but it does not alter that wretched business of the presents . Pack them up , Ginevra , like a good , honest girl , and send them back . "
41928	41935	41937	41937	she	1157	" Indeed , I wo n't , "
41941	41975	41937	41937	she	1157	" Then you are deceiving M. Isidore . It stands to reason that by accepting his presents you give him to understand he will one day receive an equivalent , in your regard ... "
41976	41982	41983	41983	she	1157	" But he wo n't , "
41986	42012	41983	41983	she	1157	" he has his equivalent now , in the pleasure of seeing me wear them - quite enough for him : he is only bourgeois . "
42042	42193	42038	42038	She	1157	" My present business is to enjoy youth , and not to think of fettering myself , by promise or vow , to this man or that . When first I saw Isidore , I believed he would help me to enjoy it I believed he would be content with my being a pretty girl ; and that we should meet and part and flutter about like two butterflies , and be happy . Lo , and behold ! I find him at times as grave as a judge , and deep - feeling and thoughtful . Bah ! Les penseurs , les hommes profonds et passionnes ne sont pas a mon gout . Le Colonel Alfred de Hamal suits me far better . Va pour les beaux fats et les jolis fripons ! Vive les joies et les plaisirs ! A bas les grandes passions et les severes vertus ! "

43427	43437	43387	43387	he	4688	" And Dr. Pillule is my very good friend , "

49412	49540	49859	49859	Meess	1432	" The windowless backs of houses built in this garden , and in particular the whole of one side , was skirted by the rear of a long line of premises - being the boarding - houses of the neighbouring college . This rear , however , was all blank stone , with the exception of certain attic loopholes high up , opening from the sleeping - rooms of the women- servants , and also one casement in a lower story said to mark the chamber or study of a master . But , though thus secure , an alley , which ran parallel with the very high wall on that side the garden , was forbidden to be entered by the pupils . It was called indeed "
49544	49834	49859	49859	Meess	1432	" and any girl setting foot there would have rendered herself liable to as severe a penalty as the mild rules of Madame Beck 's establishment permitted . Teachers might indeed go there with impunity ; but as the walk was narrow , and the neglected shrubs were grown very thick and close on each side , weaving overhead a roof of branch and leaf which the sun 's rays penetrated but in rare chequers , this alley was seldom entered even during day , and after dusk was carefully shunned . From the first I was tempted to make an exception to this rule of avoidance : the seclusion , the very gloom of the walk attracted me . For a long time the fear of seeming singular scared me away ; but by degrees , as people became accustomed to me and my habits , and to such shades of peculiarity as were engrained in my nature - shades , certainly not striking enough to interest , and perhaps not prominent enough to offend , but born in and with me , and no more to be parted with than my identity - by slow degrees I became a frequenter of this strait and narrow path . I made myself gardener of some tintless flowers that grew between its closely - ranked shrubs ; I cleared away the relics of past autumns , choking up a rustic seat at the far end . Borrowing of Goton , the cuisiniere , a pail of water and a scrubbing- brush , I made this seat clean . Madame saw me at work and smiled approbation : whether sincerely or not I do n't know ; but she seemed sincere . "
49839	49843	49859	49859	Meess	1432	" cried she , "
49861	49862	49859	49859	Meess	1432	" "
49865	49869	49859	49859	Meess	1432	" I said , "

49881	51120	49859	49859	Meess	1432	" cried she with an air of bonte ; and she kindly recommended me to confine myself to it as much as I chose , saying , that as I was not charged with the surveillance , I need not trouble myself to walk with the pupils : only I might permit her children to come there , to talk English with me . On the night in question , I was sitting on the hidden seat reclaimed from fungi and mould , listening to what seemed the far - off sounds of the city . Far off , in truth , they were not : this school was in the city 's centre ; hence , it was but five minutes ' walk to the park , scarce ten to buildings of palatial splendour . Quite near were wide streets brightly lit , teeming at this moment with life : carriages were rolling through them to balls or to the opera . The same hour which tolled curfew for our convent , which extinguished each lamp , and dropped the curtain round each couch , rang for the gay city about us the summons to festal enjoyment . Of this contrast I thought not , however : gay instincts my nature had few ; ball or opera I had never seen ; and though often I had heard them described , and even wished to see them , it was not the wish of one who hopes to partake a pleasure if she could only reach it - who feels fitted to shine in some bright distant sphere , could she but thither win her way ; it was no yearning to attain , no hunger to taste ; only the calm desire to look on a new thing . A moon was in the sky , not a full moon , but a young crescent . I saw her through a space in the boughs overhead . She and the stars , visible beside her , were no strangers where all else was strange : my childhood knew them . I had seen that golden sign with the dark globe in its curve leaning back on azure , beside an old thorn at the top of an old field , in Old England , in long past days , just as it now leaned back beside a stately spire in this continental capital . Oh , my childhood ! I had feelings : passive as I lived , little as I spoke , cold as I looked , when I thought of past days , I could feel . About the present , it was better to be stoical ; about the future - such a future as mine - to be dead . And in catalepsy and a dead trance , I studiously held the quick of my nature . At that time , I well remember whatever could excite - certain accidents of the weather , for instance , were almost dreaded by me , because they woke the being I was always lulling , and stirred up a craving cry I could not satisfy . One night a thunder - storm broke ; a sort of hurricane shook us in our beds : the Catholics rose in panic and prayed to their saints . As for me , the tempest took hold of me with tyranny : I was roughly roused and obliged to live . I got up and dressed myself , and creeping outside the casement close by my bed , sat on its ledge , with my feet on the roof of a lower adjoining building . It was wet , it was wild , it was pitch - dark . Within the dormitory they gathered round the night - lamp in consternation , praying loud . I could not go in : too resistless was the delight of staying with the wild hour , black and full of thunder , pealing out such an ode as language never delivered to man - too terribly glorious , the spectacle of clouds , split and pierced by white and blinding bolts . I did long , achingly , then and for four and twenty hours afterwards , for something to fetch me out of my present existence , and lead me upwards and onwards . This longing , and all of a similar kind , it was necessary to knock on the head ; which I did , figuratively , after the manner of Jael to Sisera , driving a nail through their temples . Unlike Sisera , they did not die : they were but transiently stunned , and at intervals would turn on the nail with a rebellious wrench : then did the temples bleed , and the brain thrill to its core . To - night , I was not so mutinous , nor so miserable . My Sisera lay quiet in the tent , slumbering ; and if his pain ached through his slumbers , something like an angel - the ideal - knelt near , dropping balm on the soothed temples , holding before the sealed eyes a magic glass , of which the sweet , solemn visions were repeated in dreams , and shedding a reflex from her moonlight wings and robe over the transfixed sleeper , over the tent threshold , over all the landscape lying without . Jael , the stern woman ; sat apart , relenting somewhat over her captive ; but more prone to dwell on the faithful expectation of Heber coming home . By which words I mean that the cool peace and dewy sweetness of the night filled me with a mood of hope : not hope on any definite point , but a general sense of encouragement and heart - ease . Should not such a mood , so sweet , so tranquil , so unwonted , have been the harbinger of good ? Alas , no good came of it ! I Presently the rude Real burst coarsely in - all evil grovelling and repellent as she too often is . Amid the intense stillness of that pile of stone overlooking the walk , the trees , the high wall , I heard a sound ; a casement all the windows here are casements , opening on hinges creaked . Ere I had time to look up and mark where , in which story , or by whom unclosed , a tree overhead shook , as if struck by a missile ; some object dropped prone at my feet . Nine was striking by St. Jean Baptiste 's clock ; day was fading , but it was not dark : the crescent moon aided little , but the deep gilding of that point in heaven where the sun beamed last , and the crystalline clearness of a wide space above , sustained the summer twilight ; even in my dark walk I could , by approaching an opening , have managed to read print of a small type . Easy was it to see then that the missile was a box , a small box of white and coloured ivory ; its loose lid opened in my hand ; violets lay within , violets smothering a closely folded bit of pink paper , a note , superscribed , "
51126	51321	49859	49859	Meess	1432	" I wore indeed a dress of French grey . Good . Was this a billet - doux ? A thing I had heard of , but hitherto had not had the honour of seeing or handling . Was it this sort of commodity I held between my finger and thumb at this moment ? Scarcely : I did not dream it for a moment . Suitor or admirer my very thoughts had not conceived . All the teachers had dreams of some lover ; one but she was naturally of a credulous turn believed in a future husband . All the pupils above fourteen knew of some prospective bridegroom ; two or three were already affianced by their parents , and had been so from childhood : but into the realm of feelings and hopes which such prospects open , my speculations , far less my presumptions , had never once had warrant to intrude . If the other teachers went into town , or took a walk on the boulevards , or only attended mass , they were very certain according to the accounts brought back to meet with some individual of the "
51325	51530	49859	49859	Meess	1432	" whose rapt , earnest gaze assured them of their power to strike and to attract . I ca n't say that my experience tallied with theirs , in this respect . I went to church and I took walks , and am very well convinced that nobody minded me . There was not a girl or woman in the Rue Fossette who could not , and did not testify to having received an admiring beam from our young doctor 's blue eyes at one time or other . I am obliged , however humbling it may sound , to except myself : as far as I was concerned , those blue eyes were guiltless , and calm as the sky , to whose tint theirs seemed akin . So it came to pass that I heard the others talk , wondered often at their gaiety , security , and self - satisfaction , but did not trouble myself to look up and gaze along the path they seemed so certain of treading . This then was no billet - doux ; and it was in settled conviction to the contrary that I quietly opened it . Thus it ran - I translate : - "
51634	51660	51661	51661	You	1433	" the reader will excuse my modesty in allowing this flattering sketch of my amiable self to retain the slight veil of the original tongue . "
51665	51672	51616	51633	de monstre , brusque et rude comme un vieux caporal de grenadiers , et reveche comme une religieuse	1436	" went on this precious effusion , "
51895	51896	51897	51897	I	0	" "
51904	51984	51897	51897	I	0	" was my comment ; and the wish bore even closer reference to the person addressed in this choice document , than to the writer thereof . Perhaps it was from the fiance of one of the engaged pupils ; and , in that case , there was no great harm done or intended - only a small irregularity . Several of the girls , the majority , indeed , had brothers or cousins at the neighbouring college . But "
51994	52273	51897	51897	I	0	" here surely was a clue - a very confusing one . The straw - hat was an ordinary garden head - screen , common to a score besides myself . The grey dress hardly gave more definite indication . Madame Beck herself ordinarily wore a grey dress just now ; another teacher , and three of the pensionnaires , had had grey dresses purchased of the same shade and fabric as mine : it was a sort of every - day wear which happened at that time to be in vogue . Meanwhile , as I pondered , I knew I must go in . Lights , moving in the dormitory , announced that prayers were over , and the pupils going to bed . Another half - hour and all doors would be locked - all lights extinguished . The front door yet stood open , to admit into the heated house the coolness of the summer night ; from the portress 's cabinet close by shone a lamp , showing the long vestibule with the two - leaved drawing - room doors on one side , the great street - door closing the vista . All at once , quick rang the bell - quick , but not loud - a cautious tinkle - a sort of warning metal whisper . Rosine darted from her cabinet and ran to open . The person she admitted stood with her two minutes in parley : there seemed a demur , a delay . Rosine came to the garden door , lamp in hand ; she stood on the steps , lifting her lamp , looking round vaguely . "
52277	52286	51897	51897	I	0	" she cried , with a coquettish laugh . "
52292	52293	51897	51897	I	0	" "
52298	52305	52306	52306	I	0	" pleaded a voice I knew : "
52312	52412	52306	52306	I	0	" and a familiar shape , tall and grand as we of the Rue Fossette all thought it , issued from the house , and strode down amongst the beds and walks . It was sacrilege - the intrusion of a man into that spot , at that hour ; but he knew himself privileged , and perhaps he trusted to the friendly night . He wandered down the alleys , looking on this side and on that - he was lost in the shrubs , trampling flowers and breaking branches in his search - he penetrated at last the "
52416	52429	52430	52431	Dr. John	135	" There I met him , like some ghost , I suppose . "
52437	52460	52430	52431	Dr. John	135	" He did not ask by whom , for with his quick eye he perceived that I held it in my hand . "
52466	52481	52430	52431	Dr. John	135	" he said , looking at me as if I were indeed a dragon . "
52500	52505	52430	52431	Dr. John	135	" was my answer . "
52519	52520	52511	52511	you	135	" "
52527	52588	52522	52522	you	135	" I thought to myself ; and yet I could not believe he wrote it : that could hardly be his style : besides , I was fool enough to think there would be a degree of hardship in his calling me such names . His own look vindicated him ; he grew hot , and coloured as he read . "
52603	52649	52522	52522	you	135	" were the words that fell from him . I thought it was cruel , when I saw his countenance so moved . No matter whether he was to blame or not ; somebody , it seemed to me , must be more to blame . "
52657	52663	52652	52652	you	1451	" he inquired of me . "
52682	52847	52665	52665	you	1451	" I thought I ought to tell , and said so ; adding that I did not believe there would be either stir or esclandre : Madame was much too prudent to make a noise about an affair of that sort connected with her establishment . He stood looking down and meditating . He was both too proud and too honourable to entreat my secresy on a point which duty evidently commanded me to communicate . I wished to do right , yet loathed to grieve or injure him . Just then Rosine glanced out through the open door ; she could not see us , though between the trees I could plainly see her : her dress was grey , like mine . This circumstance , taken in connection with prior transactions , suggested to me that perhaps the case , however deplorable , was one in which I was under no obligation whatever to concern myself . Accordingly , I said , - "
52900	52901	52893	52893	I	0	" "
52905	53170	52893	52893	I	0	" he whispered suddenly , as his hand closed on what I offered , and at the same time he pointed through the boughs . I looked . Behold Madame , in shawl , wrapping - gown , and slippers , softly descending the steps , and stealing like a cat round the garden : in two minutes she would have been upon Dr. John . If she were like a cat , however , he , quite as much , resembled a leopard : nothing could be lighter than his tread when he chose . He watched , and as she turned a corner , he took the garden at two noiseless bounds . She reappeared , and he was gone . Rosine helped him , instantly interposing the door between him and his huntress . I , too , might have got , away , but I preferred to meet Madame openly . Though it was my frequent and well - known custom to spend twilight in the garden , yet , never till now , had I remained so late . Full sure was I that Madame had missed - was come in search of me , and designed now to pounce on the defaulter unawares . I expected a reprimand . No . Madame was all goodness . She tendered not even a remonstrance ; she testified no shade of surprise . With that consummate tact of hers , in which I believe she was never surpassed by living thing , she even professed merely to have issued forth to taste "
53176	53177	52893	52893	I	0	" "
53182	53206	52893	52893	I	0	" cried she , looking up at the stars - the moon was now gone down behind the broad tower of Jean Baptiste . "
53216	53278	52893	52893	I	0	" And , instead of sending me in , she detained me to take a few turns with her down the principal alley . When at last we both re - entered , she leaned affably on my shoulder by way of support in mounting the front- door steps ; at parting , her cheek was presented to my lips , and "
53289	53536	52893	52893	I	0	" was her kindly adieu for the night . I caught myself smiling as I lay awake and thoughtful on my couch - smiling at Madame . The unction , the suavity of her behaviour offered , for one who knew her , a sure token that suspicion of some kind was busy in her brain . From some aperture or summit of observation , through parted bough or open window , she had doubtless caught a glimpse , remote or near , deceptive or instructive , of that night 's transactions . Finely accomplished as she was in the art of surveillance , it was next to impossible that a casket could be thrown into her garden , or an interloper could cross her walks to seek it , without that she , in shaken branch , passing shade , unwonted footfall , or stilly murmur and though Dr. John had spoken very low in the few words he dropped me , yet the hum of his man 's voice pervaded , I thought , the whole conventual ground - without , I say , that she should have caught intimation of things extraordinary transpiring on her premises . What things , she might by no means see , or at that time be able to discover ; but a delicious little ravelled plot lay tempting her to disentanglement ; and in the midst , folded round and round in cobwebs , had she not secured "
53539	53880	52893	52893	I	0	" clumsily involved , like the foolish fly she was ? CHAPTER XIII . A SNEEZE OUT OF SEASON . I had occasion to smile - nay , to laugh , at Madame again , within the space of four and twenty hours after the little scene treated of in the last chapter . Villette owns a climate as variable , though not so humid , as that of any English town . A night of high wind followed upon that soft sunset , and all the next day was one of dry storm - dark , beclouded , yet rainless , - the streets were dim with sand and dust , whirled from the boulevards . I know not that even lovely weather would have tempted me to spend the evening - time of study and recreation where I had spent it yesterday . My alley , and , indeed , all the walks and shrubs in the garden , had acquired a new , but not a pleasant interest ; their seclusion was now become precarious ; their calm - insecure . That casement which rained billets , had vulgarized the once dear nook it overlooked ; and elsewhere , the eyes of the flowers had gained vision , and the knots in the tree - boles listened like secret ears . Some plants there were , indeed , trodden down by Dr. John in his search , and his hasty and heedless progress , which I wished to prop up , water , and revive ; some footmarks , too , he had left on the beds : but these , in spite of the strong wind , I found a moment 's leisure to efface very early in the morning , ere common eyes had discovered them . With a pensive sort of content , I sat down to my desk and my German , while the pupils settled to their evening lessons ; and the other teachers took up their needlework . The scene of the "
53884	53964	52893	52893	I	0	" was always the refectory , a much smaller apartment than any of the three classes or schoolrooms ; for here none , save the boarders , were ever admitted , and these numbered only a score . Two lamps hung from the ceiling over the two tables ; these were lit at dusk , and their kindling was the signal for school- books being set aside , a grave demeanour assumed , general silence enforced , and then commenced "
53969	53972	52893	52893	I	0	" This said "
53975	54293	52893	52893	I	0	" was , I soon found , mainly designed as a wholesome mortification of the Intellect , a useful humiliation of the Reason ; and such a dose for Common Sense as she might digest at her leisure , and thrive on as she best could . The book brought out it was never changed , but when finished , recommenced was a venerable volume , old as the hills - grey as the Hotel de Ville . I would have given two francs for the chance of getting that book once into my bands , turning over the sacred yellow leaves , ascertaining the title , and perusing with my own eyes the enormous figments which , as an unworthy heretic , it was only permitted me to drink in with my bewildered ears . This book contained legends of the saints . Good God ! I speak the words reverently what legends they were . What gasconading rascals those saints must have been , if they first boasted these exploits or invented these miracles . These legends , however , were no more than monkish extravagances , over which one laughed inwardly ; there were , besides , priestly matters , and the priestcraft of the book was far worse than its monkery . The ears burned on each side of my head as I listened , perforce , to tales of moral martyrdom inflicted by Rome ; the dread boasts of confessors , who had wickedly abused their office , trampling to deep degradation high - born ladies , making of countesses and princesses the most tormented slaves under the sun . Stories like that of Conrad and Elizabeth of Hungary , recurred again and again , with all its dreadful viciousness , sickening tyranny and black impiety : tales that were nightmares of oppression , privation , and agony . I sat out this "
54296	54435	52893	52893	I	0	" for some nights as well as I could , and as quietly too ; only once breaking off the points of my scissors by involuntarily sticking them somewhat deep in the worm - eaten board of the table before me . But , at last , it made me so burning hot , and my temples , and my heart , and my wrist throbbed so fast , and my sleep afterwards was so broken with excitement , that I could sit no longer . Prudence recommended henceforward a swift clearance of my person from the place , the moment that guilty old book was brought out . No Mause Headrigg ever felt a stronger call to take up her testimony against Sergeant Bothwell , than I - to speak my mind in this matter of the popish "
54439	54780	52893	52893	I	0	" However , I did manage somehow to curb and rein in ; and though always , as soon as Rosine came to light the lamps , I shot from the room quickly , yet also I did it quietly ; seizing that vantage moment given by the little bustle before the dead silence , and vanishing whilst the boarders put their books away . When I vanished - it was into darkness ; candles were not allowed to be carried about , and the teacher who forsook the refectory , had only the unlit hall , schoolroom , or bedroom , as a refuge . In winter I sought the long classes , and paced them fast to keep myself warm - fortunate if the moon shone , and if there were only stars , soon reconciled to their dim gleam , or even to the total eclipse of their absence . In summer it was never quite dark , and then I went up - stairs to my own quarter of the long dormitory , opened my own casement that chamber was lit by five casements large as great doors , and leaning out , looked forth upon the city beyond the garden , and listened to band- music from the park or the palace - square , thinking meantime my own thoughts , living my own life , in my own still , shadow - world . This evening , fugitive as usual before the Pope and his works , I mounted the staircase , approached the dormitory , and quietly opened the door , which was always kept carefully shut , and which , like every other door in this house , revolved noiselessly on well - oiled hinges . Before I saw , I felt that life was in the great room , usually void : not that there was either stir or breath , or rustle of sound , but Vacuum lacked , Solitude was not at home . All the white beds - the "
54784	54896	52893	52893	I	0	" as they were poetically termed - lay visible at a glance ; all were empty : no sleeper reposed therein . The sound of a drawer cautiously slid out struck my ear ; stepping a little to one side , my vision took a free range , unimpeded by falling curtains . I now commanded my own bed and my own toilet , with a locked work - box upon it , and locked drawers underneath . Very good . A dumpy , motherly little body , in decent shawl and the cleanest of possible nightcaps , stood before this toilet , hard at work apparently doing me the kindness of "
54899	54901	52893	52893	I	0	" the "
54904	54984	52893	52893	I	0	" Open stood the lid of the work - box , open the top drawer ; duly and impartially was each succeeding drawer opened in turn : not an article of their contents but was lifted and unfolded , not a paper but was glanced over , not a little box but was unlidded ; and beautiful was the adroitness , exemplary the care with which the search was accomplished . Madame wrought at it like a true star , "
54989	55630	52893	52893	I	0	" I will not deny that it was with a secret glee I watched her . Had I been a gentleman I believe Madame would have found favour in my eyes , she was so handy , neat , thorough in all she did : some people 's movements provoke the soul by their loose awkwardness , hers - satisfied by their trim compactness . I stood , in short , fascinated ; but it was necessary to make an effort to break this spell a retreat must be beaten . The searcher might have turned and caught me ; there would have been nothing for it then but a scene , and she and I would have had to come all at once , with a sudden clash , to a thorough knowledge of each other : down would have gone conventionalities , away swept disguises , and I should have looked into her eyes , and she into mine - we should have known that we could work together no more , and parted in this life for ever . Where was the use of tempting such a catastrophe ? I was not angry , and had no wish in the world to leave her . I could hardly get another employer whose yoke would be so light and so , easy of carriage ; and truly I liked Madame for her capital sense , whatever I might think of her principles : as to her system , it did me no harm ; she might work me with it to her heart 's content : nothing would come of the operation . Loverless and inexpectant of love , I was as safe from spies in my heart - poverty , as the beggar from thieves in his destitution of purse . I turned , then , and fled ; descending the stairs with progress as swift and soundless as that of the spider , which at the same instant ran down the bannister . How I laughed when I reached the schoolroom . I knew now she had certainly seen Dr. John in the garden ; I knew what her thoughts were . The spectacle of a suspicious nature so far misled by its own inventions , tickled me much . Yet as the laugh died , a kind of wrath smote me , and then bitterness followed : it was the rock struck , and Meribah 's waters gushing out . I never had felt so strange and contradictory an inward tumult as I felt for an hour that evening : soreness and laughter , and fire , and grief , shared my heart between them . I cried hot tears : not because Madame mistrusted me - I did not care twopence for her mistrust - but for other reasons . Complicated , disquieting thoughts broke up the whole repose of my nature . However , that turmoil subsided : next day I was again Lucy Snowe . On revisiting my drawers , I found them all securely locked ; the closest subsequent examination could not discover change or apparent disturbance in the position of one object . My few dresses were folded as I had left them ; a certain little bunch of white violets that had once been silently presented to me by a stranger a stranger to me , for we had never exchanged words , and which I had dried and kept for its sweet perfume between the folds of my best dress , lay there unstirred ; my black silk scarf , my lace chemisette and collars , were unrumpled . Had she creased one solitary article , I own I should have felt much greater difficulty in forgiving her ; but finding all straight and orderly , I said , "
55646	55744	52893	52893	I	0	" A thing there was which puzzled myself , and I sought in my brain a key to that riddle almost as sedulously as Madame had sought a guide to useful knowledge in my toilet drawers . How was it that Dr. John , if he had not been accessory to the dropping of that casket into the garden , should have known that it was dropped , and appeared so promptly on the spot to seek it ? So strong was the wish to clear up this point that I began to entertain this daring suggestion : "
55768	55872	55762	55762	himself	135	" And so long as Dr. John was absent , I really believed I had courage to test him with such a question . Little Georgette was now convalescent ; and her physician accordingly made his visits very rare : indeed , he would have ceased them altogether , had not Madame insisted on his giving an occasional call till the child should be quite well . She came into the nursery one evening just after I had listened to Georgette 's lisped and broken prayer , and had put her to bed . Taking the little one 's hand , she said , "
55882	55902	55762	55762	himself	135	" And presently afterwards , looking at me with a quicker glance than was habitual to her quiet eye , "
55921	55936	55762	55762	himself	135	" Of course she knew this better than any other person in the house . "
55939	55943	55762	55762	himself	135	" she continued , "
56004	56047	55998	55998	I	0	" Now the child was well enough , only warm with the warmth of July ; it was scarcely less needful to send for a priest to administer extreme unction than for a doctor to prescribe a dose ; also Madame rarely made "
56050	56100	55998	55998	I	0	" as she called them , in the evening : moreover , this was the first time she had chosen to absent herself on the occasion of a visit from Dr. John . The whole arrangement indicated some plan ; this I saw , but without the least anxiety . "
56107	56115	56105	56105	Madame	190	" laughed Light - heart the Beggar , "
56125	56375	56105	56105	Madame	190	" She departed , attired very smartly , in a shawl of price , and a certain chapeau vert tendre - hazardous , as to its tint , for any complexion less fresh than her own , but , to her , not unbecoming . I wondered what she intended : whether she really would send Dr. John or not ; or whether indeed he would come : he might be engaged . Madame had charged me not to let Georgette sleep till the doctor came ; I had therefore sufficient occupation in telling her nursery tales and palavering the little language for her benefit . I affected Georgette ; she was a sensitive and a loving child : to hold her in my lap , or carry her in my arms , was to me a treat . To - night she would have me lay my head on the pillow of her crib ; she even put her little arms round my neck . Her clasp , and the nestling action with which she pressed her cheek to mine , made me almost cry with a tender pain . Feeling of no kind abounded in that house ; this pure little drop from a pure little source was too sweet : it penetrated deep , and subdued the heart , and sent a gush to the eyes . Half an hour or an hour passed ; Georgette murmured in her soft lisp that she was growing sleepy . "
56381	56385	56377	56377	you	1458	" thought I , "
56400	56543	56389	56389	medecin	1460	" Hark ! There was the ring , and there the tread , astonishing the staircase by the fleetness with which it left the steps behind . Rosine introduced Dr. John , and , with a freedom of manner not altogether peculiar to herself , but characteristic of the domestics of Villette generally , she stayed to hear what he had to say . Madame 's presence would have awed her back to her own realm of the vestibule and the cabinet - for mine , or that of any other teacher or pupil , she cared not a jot . Smart , trim and pert , she stood , a hand in each pocket of her gay grisette apron , eyeing Dr. John with no more fear or shyness than if he had been a picture instead of a living gentleman . "
56554	56567	56544	56547	Le marmot n'a rien	230	" said she , indicating Georgette with a jerk of her chin . "
56571	56588	56544	56547	Le marmot n'a rien	230	" was the answer , as the doctor hastily scribbled with his pencil some harmless prescription . "
56592	56608	56544	56547	Le marmot n'a rien	230	" pursued Rosine , approaching him quite near , while he put up his pencil . "
56640	56641	56618	56618	Monsieur	1464	" "
56648	56649	56642	56642	I	0	" "
56657	56705	56642	56642	I	0	" continued Rosine , speaking quite freely the very words I should so much have wished to say , but had no address or courage to bring it out : how short some people make the road to a point which , for others , seems unattainable ! "
56712	56737	56642	56642	I	0	" rejoined Dr. John briefly , but with no , sort of hauteur : he seemed quite to understand the Rosine or grisette character . "
56741	56748	56749	56749	monsieur	1465	" continued she , nothing abashed , "
56767	56768	56764	56764	he	1465	" "
56780	56784	56769	56769	I	0	" said he , "
56803	56820	56821	56821	Gustave	248	" How simple the whole explanation ! The note had alluded to a physician as then examining "
56823	56824	56821	56821	Gustave	248	" "
56828	56832	56821	56821	Gustave	248	" pursued Rosine ; "
56852	56853	56821	56821	Gustave	248	" "
56861	56870	56821	56821	Gustave	248	" responded the doctor , showing his palm . "
56874	56879	56821	56821	Gustave	248	" responded the grisette : "
56893	56894	56821	56821	Gustave	248	" "
56904	56925	56821	56821	Gustave	248	" was the doctor 's cool rejoinder . She pouted . The doctor could not help laughing at the sort of "
56927	56957	56821	56821	Gustave	248	" she made : when he laughed , he had something peculiarly good - natured and genial in his look . I saw his hand incline to his pocket . "
56973	56977	56962	56962	you	1468	" he asked . "
56987	56994	56978	56978	Monsieur	1469	" said Rosine , quite readily . "
57005	57218	56978	56978	Monsieur	1469	" rejoined he ; but I saw him give her a piece of gold , which she took unscrupulously , and then danced off to answer the door - bell , ringing just now every five minutes , as the various servants came to fetch the half - boarders . The reader must not think too hardly of Rosine ; on the whole , she was not a bad sort of person , and had no idea there could be any disgrace in grasping at whatever she could get , or any effrontery in chattering like a pie to the best gentleman in Christendom . I had learnt something from the above scene besides what concerned the ivory box : viz . , that not on the robe de jaconas , pink or grey , nor yet on the frilled and pocketed apron , lay the blame of breaking Dr. John 's heart : these items of array were obviously guiltless as Georgette 's little blue tunic . So much the better . But who then was the culprit ? What was the ground - what the origin - what the perfect explanation of the whole business ? Some points had been cleared , but how many yet remained obscure as night ! "
57221	57227	56978	56978	Monsieur	1469	" I said to myself , "
57235	57317	56978	56978	Monsieur	1469	" and turning from the face on which I had been unconsciously dwelling with a questioning gaze , I looked through the window which commanded the garden below . Dr. John , meantime , standing by the bed - side , was slowly drawing on his gloves and watching his little patient , as her eyes closed and her rosy lips parted in coming sleep . I waited till he should depart as usual , with a quick bow and scarce articulate "
57321	57409	56978	56978	Monsieur	1469	" . Just as he took his hat , my eyes , fixed on the tall houses bounding the garden , saw the one lattice , already commemorated , cautiously open ; forth from the aperture projected a hand and a white handkerchief ; both waved . I know not whether the signal was answered from some viewless quarter of our own dwelling ; but immediately after there fluttered from , the lattice a falling object , white and light - billet the second , of course . "
57412	57417	56978	56978	Monsieur	1469	" I ejaculated involuntarily . "
57420	57434	56978	56978	Monsieur	1469	" , asked Dr. John with energy , making direct for the window . "
57440	57441	56978	56978	Monsieur	1469	" "
57450	57455	57442	57442	They	1471	" was my reply . "
57463	57478	57442	57442	They	1471	" and I pointed to the lattice , now closed and looking hypocritically blank . "
57492	57500	57501	57501	Nobody	4256	" was his prompt direction ; adding , "
57513	57572	57508	57508	I	0	" Straight I went . After some little search , I found a folded paper , lodged on the lower branch of a shrub ; I seized and brought it direct to Dr. John . This time , I believe not even Rosine saw me . He instantly tore the billet into small pieces , without reading it . "
57586	57594	57579	57579	her	1474	" he said , looking at me . "
57598	57602	57579	57579	her	1474	" I asked . "
57607	57608	57609	57609	You	1473	" "
57617	57618	57609	57609	You	1473	" "
57624	57625	57609	57609	You	1473	" "
57631	57632	57609	57609	You	1473	" "
57635	57636	57609	57609	You	1473	" "
57670	57671	57673	57674	a duenna	1476	" "
57676	57680	57673	57674	a duenna	1476	" I asked . "
57683	57688	57673	57674	a duenna	1476	" said he abstractedly . "
57695	57812	57813	57813	I	0	" he added , musingly : and now , certainly for the first time , he examined my face , anxious , doubtless , to see if any kindly expression there , would warrant him in recommending to my care and indulgence some ethereal creature , against whom powers of darkness were plotting . I felt no particular vocation to undertake the surveillance of ethereal creatures ; but recalling the scene at the bureau , it seemed to me that I owed him a good turn : if I could help him then I would , and it lay not with me to decide how . With as little reluctance as might be , I intimated that "
57834	57836	57837	57837	I	0	" . "
57847	57864	57837	57837	I	0	" said he , with a modesty , admirable , as I thought , to witness . "
57973	57978	57981	57981	I	0	" - he paused . "
57988	57992	57981	57981	I	0	" said I , "
57998	58031	57981	57981	I	0	" And busily , in my own mind , I ran over the list of our inmates , seeking this paragon , this pearl of great price , this gem without flaw . "
58037	58041	58035	58035	Madame	190	" I concluded . "
58103	58117	58118	58118	I	0	" Just notify the quarter to which my care is to be directed , "
58210	58219	58221	58221	I	0	" I will - I will help you , "
58224	58253	58221	58221	I	0	" I will do what you wish . I will watch over your angel ; I will take care of her , only tell me who she is . "
58254	58260	58262	58262	he	135	" But you must know , "
58272	58299	58262	58262	he	135	" So spotless , so good , so unspeakably beautiful ! impossible that one house should contain two like her . I allude , of course - "
58472	58475	58470	58470	she	190	" enrhumee , "
58483	58488	58463	58463	She	190	" courses en fiacre . "
59113	59123	59109	59109	She	190	" because it suited her interest to do so ; "
59219	59238	59240	59240	Madame	190	" Je sais bien qu'elle n'a pas de principes , ni , peut - etre , de moeurs , "
59289	59405	59240	59240	Madame	190	" A strange , frolicsome , noisy little world was this school : great pains were taken to hide chains with flowers : a subtle essence of Romanism pervaded every arrangement : large sensual indulgence so to speak was permitted by way of counterpoise to jealous spiritual restraint . Each mind was being reared in slavery ; but , to prevent reflection from dwelling on this fact , every pretext for physical recreation was seized and made the most of . There , as elsewhere , the CHURCH strove to bring up her children robust in body , feeble in soul , fat , ruddy , hale , joyous , ignorant , unthinking , unquestioning . "
59413	59417	59240	59240	Madame	190	" she says . "
59444	59465	59429	59429	I	0	" A bargain , in which every true Catholic deems himself a gainer . Lucifer just offers the same terms : "
59510	59622	59497	59497	thou	1519	" About this time - in the ripest glow of summer - Madame Beck 's house became as merry a place as a school could well be . All day long the broad folding - doors and the two - leaved casements stood wide open : settled sunshine seemed naturalized in the atmosphere ; clouds were far off , sailing away beyond sea , resting , no doubt , round islands such as England - that dear land of mists - but withdrawn wholly from the drier continent . We lived far more in the garden than under a roof : classes were held , and meals partaken of , in the "
59626	59767	59497	59497	thou	1519	" Moreover , there was a note of holiday preparation , which almost turned freedom into licence . The autumnal long vacation was but two months distant ; but before that , a great day - an important ceremony - none other than the fete of Madame - awaited celebration . The conduct of this fete devolved chiefly on Mademoiselle St. Pierre : Madame herself being supposed to stand aloof , disinterestedly unconscious of what might be going forward in her honour . Especially , she never knew , never in the least suspected , that a subscription was annually levied on the whole school for the purchase of a handsome present . The polite tact of the reader will please to leave out of the account a brief , secret consultation on this point in Madame 's own chamber . "
59775	59783	59770	59770	you	1520	" was asked by her Parisian lieutenant . "
59801	59830	59794	59796	the poor children	1521	" And Madame looked benign and modest . The St. Pierre would here protrude her chin ; she knew Madame by heart ; she always called her airs of "
59832	59834	59794	59796	the poor children	1521	" - "
59838	59849	59794	59796	the poor children	1521	" She never even professed to respect them one instant . "
59852	59858	59794	59796	the poor children	1521	" she would say coldly . "
59874	59875	59794	59796	the poor children	1521	" "
59891	60308	59794	59796	the poor children	1521	" And the result was a handsome case , containing 300 francs worth of plate . The programme of the fete - day 's proceedings comprised : Presentation of plate , collation in the garden , dramatic performance with pupils and teachers for actors , a dance and supper . Very gorgeous seemed the effect of the whole to me , as I well remember . Zelie St. Pierre understood these things and managed them ably . The play was the main point ; a month 's previous drilling being there required . The choice , too , of the actors required knowledge and care ; then came lessons in elocution , in attitude , and then the fatigue of countless rehearsals . For all this , as may well be supposed , St. Pierre did not suffice : other management , other accomplishments than hers were requisite here . They were supplied in the person of a master - M. Paul Emanuel , professor of literature . It was never my lot to be present at the histrionic lessons of M. Paul , but I often saw him as he crossed the carre a square hall between the dwelling - house and school - house . I heard him , too , in the warm evenings , lecturing with open doors , and his name , with anecdotes of him , resounded in ones ears from all sides . Especially our former acquaintance , Miss Ginevra Fanshawe , - who had been selected to take a prominent part in the play - used , in bestowing upon me a large portion of her leisure , to lard her discourse with frequent allusions to his sayings and doings . She esteemed him hideously plain , and used to profess herself frightened almost into hysterics at the sound of his step or voice . A dark little man he certainly was ; pungent and austere . Even to me he seemed a harsh apparition , with his close- shorn , black head , his broad , sallow brow , his thin cheek , his wide and quivering nostril , his thorough glance , and hurried bearing . Irritable he was ; one heard that , as he apostrophized with vehemence the awkward squad under his orders . Sometimes he would break out on these raw amateur actresses with a passion of impatience at their falseness of conception , their coldness of emotion , their feebleness of delivery . "
60311	60370	59794	59796	the poor children	1521	" he would cry ; and then his voice rang through the premises like a trumpet ; and when , mimicking it , came the small pipe of a Ginevra , a Mathilde , or a Blanche , one understood why a hollow groan of scorn , or a fierce hiss of rage , rewarded the tame echo . "
60378	60384	59794	59796	the poor children	1521	" I heard him thunder . "
60428	60860	61378	61378	she	1522	" Vain resolve ! And when he at last found it was vain , he suddenly broke the whole business down . Hitherto he had been teaching them a grand tragedy ; he tore the tragedy in morsels , and came next day with a compact little comic trifle . To this they took more kindly ; he presently knocked it all into their smooth round pates . Mademoiselle St. Pierre always presided at M. Emanuel 's lessons , and I was told that the polish of her manner , her seeming attention , her tact and grace , impressed that gentleman very favourably . She had , indeed , the art of pleasing , for a given time , whom she would ; but the feeling would not last : in an hour it was dried like dew , vanished like gossamer . The day preceding Madame 's fete was as much a holiday as the fete itself . It was devoted to clearing out , cleaning , arranging and decorating the three schoolrooms . All within - doors was the gayest bustle ; neither up - stairs nor down could a quiet , isolated person find rest for the sole of her foot ; accordingly , for my part , I took refuge in the garden . The whole day did I wander or sit there alone , finding warmth in the sun , shelter among the trees , and a sort of companionship in my own thoughts . I well remember that I exchanged but two sentences that day with any living being : not that I felt solitary ; I was glad to be quiet . For a looker - on , it sufficed to pass through the rooms once or twice , observe what changes were being wrought , how a green - room and a dressing - room were being contrived , a little stage with scenery erected , how M. Paul Emanuel , in conjunction with Mademoiselle St. Pierre , was directing all , and how an eager band of pupils , amongst them Ginevra Fanshawe , were working gaily under his control . The great day arrived . The sun rose hot and unclouded , and hot and unclouded it burned on till evening . All the doors and all the windows were set open , which gave a pleasant sense of summer freedom - and freedom the most complete seemed indeed the order of the day . Teachers and pupils descended to breakfast in dressing - gowns and curl - papers : anticipating "
60863	60905	61378	61378	she	1522	" the toilette of the evening , they seemed to take a pleasure in indulging that forenoon in a luxury of slovenliness ; like aldermen fasting in preparation for a feast . About nine o'clock A.M. , an important functionary , the "
60908	61365	61378	61378	she	1522	" arrived . Sacrilegious to state , he fixed his head - quarters in the oratory , and there , in presence of benitier , candle , and crucifix , solemnised the mysteries of his art . Each girl was summoned in turn to pass through his hands ; emerging from them with head as smooth as a shell , intersected by faultless white lines , and wreathed about with Grecian plaits that shone as if lacquered . I took my turn with the rest , and could hardly believe what the glass said when I applied to it for information afterwards ; the lavished garlandry of woven brown hair amazed me - I feared it was not all my own , and it required several convincing pulls to give assurance to the contrary . I then acknowledged in the coiffeur a first - rate artist - one who certainly made the most of indifferent materials . The oratory closed , the dormitory became the scene of ablutions , arrayings and bedizenings curiously elaborate . To me it was , and ever must be an enigma , how they contrived to spend so much time in doing so little . The operation seemed close , intricate , prolonged : the result simple . A clear white muslin dress , a blue sash the Virgin 's colours , a pair of white , or straw - colour kid gloves - such was the gala uniform , to the assumption whereof that houseful of teachers and pupils devoted three mortal hours . But though simple , it must be allowed the array was perfect - perfect in fashion , fit , and freshness ; every head being also dressed with exquisite nicety , and a certain compact taste - suiting the full , firm comeliness of Labassecourien contours , though too stiff for any more flowing and flexible style of beauty - the general effect was , on the whole , commendable . In beholding this diaphanous and snowy mass , I well remember feeling myself to be a mere shadowy spot on a field of light ; the courage was not in me to put on a transparent white dress : something thin I must wear - the weather and rooms being too hot to give substantial fabrics sufferance , so I had sought through a dozen shops till I lit upon a crape - like material of purple - gray - the colour , in short , of dun mist , lying on a moor in bloom . My tailleuse had kindly made it as well as she could : because , as she judiciously observed , it was ' si triste - si pen voyant , "
61554	61557	61550	61550	she	190	" convenablement , "

62276	62318	62261	62263	M. Paul Emanuel	196	" Play you must . I will not have you shrink , or frown , or make the prude . I read your skull that night you came ; I see your moyens : play you can ; play you must . "

62523	62675	62520	62520	he	196	" Louise Vanderkelkov has fallen ill - at least so her ridiculous mother asserts ; for my part , I feel sure she might play if she would : it is only good - will that lacks . She was charged with a role , as you know , or do not know - it is equal : without that role the play is stopped . There are now but a few hours in which to learn it : not a girl in this school would hear reason , and accept the task . Forsooth , it is not an interesting , not an amiable , part ; their vile amour - propre - that base quality of which women have so much - would revolt from it . Englishwomen are either the best or the worst of their sex . Dieu sait que je les deteste comme la peste , ordinairement "

This is an amateur affair , it is true - a vaudeville de pensionnat ; certain modifications I might sanction , yet something you must have to announce you as of the nobler sex . "
65559	65595	65596	65596	Monsieur	1633	" And I will , Monsieur ; but it must be arranged in my own way : nobody must meddle ; the things must not be forced upon me . Just let me dress myself . "

I am pretty ; you ca n't deny that ; I may have as many admirers as I choose . This very night I have been breaking the hearts of two gentlemen , and it is the dying look I had from one of them just now , which puts me in such spirits . I do so like to watch them turn red and pale , and scowl and dart fiery glances at each other , and languishing ones at me . There is me - happy ME ; now for you , poor soul ! "

69358	69455	69239	69239	I	0	" I believe I could have picked out the conquering de Hamal even undirected . He was a straight - nosed , very correct - featured little dandy . I say little dandy , though he was not beneath the middle standard in stature ; but his lineaments were small , and so were his hands and feet ; and he was pretty and smooth , and as trim as a doll : so nicely dressed , so nicely curled , so booted and gloved and cravated - he was charming indeed . I said so . "
69462	69594	69239	69239	I	0	" cried I , and commended Ginevra 's taste warmly ; and asked her what she thought de Hamal might have done with the precious fragments of that heart she had broken - whether he kept them in a scent - vial , and conserved them in otto of roses ? I observed , too , with deep rapture of approbation , that the colonel 's hands were scarce larger than Miss Fanshawe 's own , and suggested that this circumstance might be convenient , as he could wear her gloves at a pinch . On his dear curls , I told her I doated : and as to his low , Grecian brow , and exquisite classic headpiece , I confessed I had no language to do such perfections justice . "

I knew where there were plenty of shawls near at hand ; I ran and fetched one . "
70127	70147	70114	70114	She	1732	" said I , folding it well round her muslin dress , covering carefully her neck and her arms . "
70152	70173	70150	70150	Isidore	190	" I asked , in a somewhat fierce whisper . She pushed up her lip , smiled , and nodded . "
70178	70195	70176	70176	Isidore	190	" I repeated , giving her a shake : I could have given her a dozen . "
70201	70205	70208	70208	he	1733	" said she . "
70228	70235	70236	70239	The Colonel - Count	1734	" Dr. John now passed on . "
70241	70245	70236	70239	The Colonel - Count	1734	" I echoed . "

70471	70517	70518	70518	Him	1742	" I had got her out into the garden ere this . I now set her down on a seat and told her she should not stir till she had avowed which she meant in the end to accept - the man or the monkey . "
70524	70528	70519	70519	you	1743	" said she , "
70656	70951	70952	70952	You	1749	" I slackened my grasp , and she darted off . I did not care to pursue her . Somehow I could not avoid returning once more in the direction of the corridor to get another glimpse of Dr. John ; but I met him on the garden - steps , standing where the light from a window fell broad . His well - proportioned figure was not to be mistaken , for I doubt whether there was another in that assemblage his equal . He carried his hat in his hand ; his uncovered head , his face and fine brow were most handsome and manly . His features were not delicate , not slight like those of a woman , nor were they cold , frivolous , and feeble ; though well cut , they were not so chiselled , so frittered away , as to lose in expression or significance what they gained in unmeaning symmetry . Much feeling spoke in them at times , and more sat silent in his eye . Such at least were my thoughts of him : to me he seemed all this . An inexpressible sense of wonder occupied me , as I looked at this man , and reflected that he could not be slighted . It was , not my intention to approach or address him in the garden , our terms of acquaintance not warranting such a step ; I had only meant to view him in the crowd - myself unseen : coming upon him thus alone , I withdrew . But he was looking out for me , or rather for her who had been with me : therefore he descended the steps , and followed me down the alley . "

72008	72014	71993	71997	the young , graceful Apollo	1774	" said Dr. John curtly , "

72066	72289	72057	72057	you	135	" And now I paused . For the second time that night I was going beyond myself - venturing out of what I looked on as my natural habits - speaking in an unpremeditated , impulsive strain , which startled me strangely when I halted to reflect . On rising that morning , had I anticipated that before night I should have acted the part of a gay lover in a vaudeville ; and an hour after , frankly discussed with Dr. John the question of his hapless suit , and rallied him on his illusions ? I had no more presaged such feats than I had looked forward to an ascent in a balloon , or a voyage to Cape Horn . The Doctor and I , having paced down the walk , were now returning ; the reflex from the window again lit his face : he smiled , but his eye was melancholy . How I wished that he could feel heart's - ease ! How I grieved that he brooded over pain , and pain from such a cause ! He , with his great advantages , he to love in vain ! I did not then know that the pensiveness of reverse is the best phase for some minds ; nor did I reflect that some herbs , "
72302	72303	72348	72349	Dr. John	135	" "
72313	72318	72348	72349	Dr. John	135	" I broke out . "
72359	72538	72348	72349	Dr. John	135	" In return for this speech I got - what , it must be supposed , I deserved - a look of surprise : I thought also of some disapprobation . We parted , and I went into the house very chill . The clocks struck and the bells tolled midnight ; people were leaving fast : the fete was over ; the lamps were fading . In another hour all the dwelling - house , and all the pensionnat , were dark and hushed . I too was in bed , but not asleep . To me it was not easy to sleep after a day of such excitement . CHAPTER XV . THE LONG VACATION . Following Madame Beck 's fete , with its three preceding weeks of relaxation , its brief twelve hours ' burst of hilarity and dissipation , and its one subsequent day of utter languor , came a period of reaction ; two months of real application , of close , hard study . These two months , being the last of the "
72542	72980	72348	72349	Dr. John	135	" were indeed the only genuine working months in the year . To them was procrastinated - into them concentrated , alike by professors , mistresses , and pupils - the main burden of preparation for the examinations preceding the distribution of prizes . Candidates for rewards had then to work in good earnest ; masters and teachers had to set their shoulders to the wheel , to urge on the backward , and diligently aid and train the more promising . A showy demonstration - a telling exhibition - must be got up for public view , and all means were fair to this end . I scarcely noted how the other teachers went to work ; I had my own business to mind ; and my task was not the least onerous , being to imbue some ninety sets of brains with a due tincture of what they considered a most complicated and difficult science , that of the English language ; and to drill ninety tongues in what , for them , was an almost impossible pronunciation - the lisping and hissing dentals of the Isles . The examination - day arrived . Awful day ! Prepared for with anxious care , dressed for with silent despatch - nothing vaporous or fluttering now - no white gauze or azure streamers ; the grave , close , compact was the order of the toilette . It seemed to me that I was this day , especially doomed - the main burden and trial falling on me alone of all the female teachers . The others were not expected to examine in the studies they taught ; the professor of literature , M. Paul , taking upon himself this duty . He , this school autocrat , gathered all and sundry reins into the hollow of his one hand ; he irefully rejected any colleague ; he would not have help . Madame herself , who evidently rather wished to undertake the examination in geography - her favourite study , which she taught well - was forced to succumb , and be subordinate to her despotic kinsman 's direction . The whole staff of instructors , male and female , he set aside , and stood on the examiner 's estrade alone . It irked him that he was forced to make one exception to this rule . He could not manage English : he was obliged to leave that branch of education in the English teacher 's hands ; which he did , not without a flash of naive jealousy . A constant crusade against the "
72984	73086	72348	72349	Dr. John	135	" of every human being but himself , was the crotchet of this able , but fiery and grasping little man . He had a strong relish for public representation in his own person , but an extreme abhorrence of the like display in any other . He quelled , he kept down when he could ; and when he could not , he fumed like a bottled storm . On the evening preceding the examination - day , I was walking in the garden , as were the other teachers and all the boarders . M. Emanuel joined me in the "
73090	73148	72348	72349	Dr. John	135	" his cigar was at his lips ; his paletot - a most characteristic garment of no particular shape - hung dark and menacing ; the tassel of his bonnet grec sternly shadowed his left temple ; his black whiskers curled like those of a wrathful cat ; his blue eye had a cloud in its glitter . "
73151	73161	73149	73149	Ainsi	274	" he began , abruptly fronting and arresting me , "
73200	73394	72348	72349	Dr. John	135	" Now the fact was , he happened to be entirely mistaken . I did not - could not - estimate the admiration or the good opinion of tomorrow 's audience at the same rate he did . Had that audience numbered as many personal friends and acquaintance for me as for him , I know not how it might have been : I speak of the case as it stood . On me school- triumphs shed but a cold lustre . I had wondered - and I wondered now - how it was that for him they seemed to shine as with hearth - warmth and hearth - glow . He cared for them perhaps too much ; I , probably , too little . However , I had my own fancies as well as he . I liked , for instance , to see M. Emanuel jealous ; it lit up his nature , and woke his spirit ; it threw all sorts of queer lights and shadows over his dun face , and into his violet - azure eyes he used to say that his black hair and blue eyes were "
73399	73455	73456	73456	I	0	" . There was a relish in his anger ; it was artless , earnest , quite unreasonable , but never hypocritical . I uttered no disclaimer then of the complacency he attributed to me ; I merely asked where the English examination came in - whether at the commencement or close of the day ? "
73459	73463	73149	73149	Ainsi	274	" said he , "
73516	73517	73523	73523	Monsieur	1782	" "
73525	73532	73533	73533	One	607	" I said , affecting dejection . "
73596	73597	73586	73586	I	0	" "
73606	73615	73598	73598	You	1782	" Without answering directly , he went on , "

73774	73775	73777	73777	I	0	" "

73878	73890	73863	73863	Madame	190	" He smoked his cigar in silence . He turned suddenly . "
73897	73920	73863	73863	Madame	190	" said he , and the spite and jealousy melted out of his face , and a generous kindliness shone there instead . "
73934	73938	73932	73932	friends	533	" he pursued . "
74030	74031	74027	74027	you	0	" "
74054	74055	74046	74046	I	0	" "
74058	75692	74046	74046	I	0	" said he , and turned away and left the alley . The examination passed over well ; M. Paul was as good as his word , and did his best to make my part easy . The next day came the distribution of prizes ; that also passed ; the school broke up ; the pupils went home , and now began the long vacation . That vacation ! Shall I ever forget it ? I think not . Madame Beck went , the first day of the holidays , to join her children at the sea - side ; all the three teachers had parents or friends with whom they took refuge ; every professor quitted the city ; some went to Paris , some to Boue - Marine ; M. Paul set forth on a pilgrimage to Rome ; the house was left quite empty , but for me , a servant , and a poor deformed and imbecile pupil , a sort of cretin , whom her stepmother in a distant province would not allow to return home . My heart almost died within me ; miserable longings strained its chords . How long were the September days ! How silent , how lifeless ! How vast and void seemed the desolate premises ! How gloomy the forsaken garden - grey now with the dust of a town summer departed . Looking forward at the commencement of those eight weeks , I hardly knew how I was to live to the end . My spirits had long been gradually sinking ; now that the prop of employment was withdrawn , they went down fast . Even to look forward was not to hope : the dumb future spoke no comfort , offered no promise , gave no inducement to bear present evil in reliance on future good . A sorrowful indifference to existence often pressed on me - a despairing resignation to reach betimes the end of all things earthly . Alas ! When I had full leisure to look on life as life must be looked on by such as me , I found it but a hopeless desert : tawny sands , with no green fields , no palm - tree , no well in view . The hopes which are dear to youth , which bear it up and lead it on , I knew not and dared not know . If they knocked at my heart sometimes , an inhospitable bar to admission must be inwardly drawn . When they turned away thus rejected , tears sad enough sometimes flowed : but it could not be helped : I dared not give such guests lodging . So mortally did I fear the sin and weakness of presumption . Religious reader , you will preach to me a long sermon about what I have just written , and so will you , moralist : and you , stern sage : you , stoic , will frown ; you , cynic , sneer ; you , epicure , laugh . Well , each and all , take it your own way . I accept the sermon , frown , sneer , and laugh ; perhaps you are all right : and perhaps , circumstanced like me , you would have been , like me , wrong . The first month was , indeed , a long , black , heavy month to me . The cretin did not seem unhappy . I did my best to feed her well and keep her warm , and she only asked food and sunshine , or when that lacked , fire . Her weak faculties approved of inertion : her brain , her eyes , her ears , her heart slept content ; they could not wake to work , so lethargy was their Paradise . Three weeks of that vacation were hot , fair , and dry , but the fourth and fifth were tempestuous and wet . I do not know why that change in the atmosphere made a cruel impression on me , why the raging storm and beating rain crushed me with a deadlier paralysis than I had experienced while the air had remained serene ; but so it was ; and my nervous system could hardly support what it had for many days and nights to undergo in that huge empty house . How I used to pray to Heaven for consolation and support ! With what dread force the conviction would grasp me that Fate was my permanent foe , never to be conciliated . I did not , in my heart , arraign the mercy or justice of God for this ; I concluded it to be a part of his great plan that some must deeply suffer while they live , and I thrilled in the certainty that of this number , I was one . It was some relief when an aunt of the cretin , a kind old woman , came one day , and took away my strange , deformed companion . The hapless creature had been at times a heavy charge ; I could not take her out beyond the garden , and I could not leave her a minute alone : for her poor mind , like her body , was warped : its propensity was to evil . A vague bent to mischief , an aimless malevolence , made constant vigilance indispensable . As she very rarely spoke , and would sit for hours together moping and mowing , and distorting her features with indescribable grimaces , it was more like being prisoned with some strange tameless animal , than associating with a human being . Then there were personal attentions to be rendered which required the nerve of a hospital nurse ; my resolution was so tried , it sometimes fell dead - sick . These duties should not have fallen on me ; a servant , now absent , had rendered them hitherto , and in the hurry of holiday departure , no substitute to fill this office had been provided . This tax and trial were by no means the least I have known in life . Still , menial and distasteful as they were , my mental pain was far more wasting and wearing . Attendance on the cretin deprived me often of the power and inclination to swallow a meal , and sent me faint to the fresh air , and the well or fountain in the court ; but this duty never wrung my heart , or brimmed my eyes , or scalded my cheek with tears hot as molten metal . The cretin being gone , I was free to walk out . At first I lacked courage to venture very far from the Rue Fossette , but by degrees I sought the city gates , and passed them , and then went wandering away far along chaussees , through fields , beyond cemeteries , Catholic and Protestant , beyond farmsteads , to lanes and little woods , and I know not where . A goad thrust me on , a fever forbade me to rest ; a want of companionship maintained in my soul the cravings of a most deadly famine . I often walked all day , through the burning noon and the arid afternoon , and the dusk evening , and came back with moonrise . While wandering in solitude , I would sometimes picture the present probable position of others , my acquaintance . There was Madame Beck at a cheerful watering - place with her children , her mother , and a whole troop of friends who had sought the same scene of relaxation . Zelie St. Pierre was at Paris , with her relatives ; the other teachers were at their homes . There was Ginevra Fanshawe , whom certain of her connections had carried on a pleasant tour southward . Ginevra seemed to me the happiest . She was on the route of beautiful scenery ; these September suns shone for her on fertile plains , where harvest and vintage matured under their mellow beam . These gold and crystal moons rose on her vision over blue horizons waved in mounted lines . But all this was nothing ; I too felt those autumn suns and saw those harvest moons , and I almost wished to be covered in with earth and turf , deep out of their influence ; for I could not live in their light , nor make them comrades , nor yield them affection . But Ginevra had a kind of spirit with her , empowered to give constant strength and comfort , to gladden daylight and embalm darkness ; the best of the good genii that guard humanity curtained her with his wings , and canopied her head with his bending form . By True Love was Ginevra followed : never could she be alone . Was she insensible to this presence ? It seemed to me impossible : I could not realize such deadness . I imagined her grateful in secret , loving now with reserve ; but purposing one day to show how much she loved : I pictured her faithful hero half conscious of her coy fondness , and comforted by that consciousness : I conceived an electric chord of sympathy between them , a fine chain of mutual understanding , sustaining union through a separation of a hundred leagues - carrying , across mound and hollow , communication by prayer and wish . Ginevra gradually became with me a sort of heroine . One day , perceiving this growing illusion , I said , "
75727	76178	75723	75723	I	0	" Indeed there was no way to keep well under the circumstances . At last a day and night of peculiarly agonizing depression were succeeded by physical illness , I took perforce to my bed . About this time the Indian summer closed and the equinoctial storms began ; and for nine dark and wet days , of which the hours rushed on all turbulent , deaf , dishevelled - bewildered with sounding hurricane - I lay in a strange fever of the nerves and blood . Sleep went quite away . I used to rise in the night , look round for her , beseech her earnestly to return . A rattle of the window , a cry of the blast only replied - -Sleep never came ! I err . She came once , but in anger . Impatient of my importunity she brought with her an avenging dream . By the clock of St. Jean Baptiste , that dream remained scarce fifteen minutes - a brief space , but sufficing to wring my whole frame with unknown anguish ; to confer a nameless experience that had the hue , the mien , the terror , the very tone of a visitation from eternity . Between twelve and one that night a cup was forced to my lips , black , strong , strange , drawn from no well , but filled up seething from a bottomless and boundless sea . Suffering , brewed in temporal or calculable measure , and mixed for mortal lips , tastes not as this suffering tasted . Having drank and woke , I thought all was over : the end come and past by . Trembling fearfully - as consciousness returned - ready to cry out on some fellow- creature to help me , only that I knew no fellow - creature was near enough to catch the wild summons - Goton in her far distant attic could not hear - I rose on my knees in bed . Some fearful hours went over me : indescribably was I torn , racked and oppressed in mind . Amidst the horrors of that dream I think the worst lay here . Methought the well- loved dead , who had loved me well in life , met me elsewhere , alienated : galled was my inmost spirit with an unutterable sense of despair about the future . Motive there was none why I should try to recover or wish to live ; and yet quite unendurable was the pitiless and haughty voice in which Death challenged me to engage his unknown terrors . When I tried to pray I could only utter these words : "
76193	76758	75723	75723	I	0	" Most true was it . On bringing me my tea next morning Goton urged me to call in a doctor . I would not : I thought no doctor could cure me . One evening - and I was not delirious : I was in my sane mind , I got up - I dressed myself , weak and shaking . The solitude and the stillness of the long dormitory could not be borne any longer ; the ghastly white beds were turning into spectres - the coronal of each became a death's- head , huge and sun - bleached - dead dreams of an elder world and mightier race lay frozen in their wide gaping eyeholes . That evening more firmly than ever fastened into my soul the conviction that Fate was of stone , and Hope a false idol - blind , bloodless , and of granite core . I felt , too , that the trial God had appointed me was gaining its climax , and must now be turned by my own hands , hot , feeble , trembling as they were . It rained still , and blew ; but with more clemency , I thought , than it had poured and raged all day . Twilight was falling , and I deemed its influence pitiful ; from the lattice I saw coming night - clouds trailing low like banners drooping . It seemed to me that at this hour there was affection and sorrow in Heaven above for all pain suffered on earth beneath ; the weight of my dreadful dream became alleviated - that insufferable thought of being no more loved - no more owned , half - yielded to hope of the contrary - I was sure this hope would shine clearer if I got out from under this house - roof , which was crushing as the slab of a tomb , and went outside the city to a certain quiet hill , a long way distant in the fields . Covered with a cloak I could not be delirious , for I had sense and recollection to put on warm clothing , forth I set . The bells of a church arrested me in passing ; they seemed to call me in to the salut , and I went in . Any solemn rite , any spectacle of sincere worship , any opening for appeal to God was as welcome to me then as bread to one in extremity of want . I knelt down with others on the stone pavement . It was an old solemn church , its pervading gloom not gilded but purpled by light shed through stained glass . Few worshippers were assembled , and , the salut over , half of them departed . I discovered soon that those left remained to confess . I did not stir . Carefully every door of the church was shut ; a holy quiet sank upon , and a solemn shade gathered about us . After a space , breathless and spent in prayer , a penitent approached the confessional . I watched . She whispered her avowal ; her shrift was whispered back ; she returned consoled . Another went , and another . A pale lady , kneeling near me , said in a low , kind voice : - "
76769	76895	76760	76760	you	1799	" Mechanically obedient , I rose and went . I knew what I was about ; my mind had run over the intent with lightning - speed . To take this step could not make me more wretched than I was ; it might soothe me . The priest within the confessional never turned his eyes to regard me ; he only quietly inclined his ear to my lips . He might be a good man , but this duty had become to him a sort of form : he went through it with the phlegm of custom . I hesitated ; of the formula of confession I was ignorant : instead of commencing , then , with the prelude usual , I said : - "
76903	77029	76896	76897	Mon pere	1800	" He directly turned . He was not a native priest : of that class , the cast of physiognomy is , almost invariably , grovelling : I saw by his profile and brow he was a Frenchman ; though grey and advanced in years , he did not , I think , lack feeling or intelligence . He inquired , not unkindly , why , being a Protestant , I came to him ? I said I was perishing for a word of advice or an accent of comfort . I had been living for some weeks quite alone ; I had been ill ; I had a pressure of affliction on my mind of which it would hardly any longer endure the weight . "
77038	77078	77079	77079	You	1801	" he inquired , somewhat startled . I reassured him on this point , and , as well as I could , I showed him the mere outline of my experience . He looked thoughtful , surprised , puzzled . "
77084	77088	77079	77079	You	1801	" said he . "
77133	77200	77123	77123	I	0	" Of course , I had not expected he would be ; but the mere relief of communication in an ear which was human and sentient , yet consecrated - the mere pouring out of some portion of long accumulating , long pent - up pain into a vessel whence it could not be again diffused - had done me good . I was already solaced . "
77207	77217	77205	77205	father	1803	" I asked of him as he sat silent . "
77221	77242	77205	77205	father	1803	" he said kindly - and I am sure he was a kind man : he had a compassionate eye - "
77511	77528	77529	77529	You	1804	" I rose and thanked him . I was withdrawing when he signed me to return . "
77537	77541	77542	77542	I	0	" said he : "
77566	77574	77555	77555	you	1804	" and he gave me his address . "
77584	78738	77555	77555	you	1804	" In reply to this appointment , I only bowed ; and pulling down my veil , and gathering round me my cloak , I glided away . Did I , do you suppose , reader , contemplate venturing again within that worthy priest 's reach ? As soon should I have thought of walking into a Babylonish furnace . That priest had arms which could influence me : he was naturally kind , with a sentimental French kindness , to whose softness I knew myself not wholly impervious . Without respecting some sorts of affection , there was hardly any sort having a fibre of root in reality , which I could rely on my force wholly to withstand . Had I gone to him , he would have shown me all that was tender , and comforting , and gentle , in the honest Popish superstition . Then he would have tried to kindle , blow and stir up in me the zeal of good works . I know not how it would all have ended . We all think ourselves strong in some points ; we all know ourselves weak in many ; the probabilities are that had I visited Numero 10 , Rue des Mages , at the hour and day appointed , I might just now , instead of writing this heretic narrative , be counting my beads in the cell of a certain Carmelite convent on the Boulevard of Crecy , in Villette . There was something of Fenelon about that benign old priest ; and whatever most of his brethren may be , and whatever I may think of his Church and creed and I like neither , of himself I must ever retain a grateful recollection . He was kind when I needed kindness ; he did me good . May Heaven bless him ! Twilight had passed into night , and the lamps were lit in the streets ere I issued from that sombre church . To turn back was now become possible to me ; the wild longing to breathe this October wind on the little hill far without the city walls had ceased to be an imperative impulse , and was softened into a wish with which Reason could cope : she put it down , and I turned , as I thought , to the Rue Fossette . But I had become involved in a part of the city with which I was not familiar ; it was the old part , and full of narrow streets of picturesque , ancient , and mouldering houses . I was much too weak to be very collected , and I was still too careless of my own welfare and safety to be cautious ; I grew embarrassed ; I got immeshed in a network of turns unknown . I was lost and had no resolution to ask guidance of any passenger . If the storm had lulled a little at sunset , it made up now for lost time . Strong and horizontal thundered the current of the wind from north - west to south - east ; it brought rain like spray , and sometimes a sharp hail , like shot : it was cold and pierced me to the vitals . I bent my head to meet it , but it beat me back . My heart did not fail at all in this conflict ; I only wished that I had wings and could ascend the gale , spread and repose my pinions on its strength , career in its course , sweep where it swept . While wishing this , I suddenly felt colder where before I was cold , and more powerless where before I was weak . I tried to reach the porch of a great building near , but the mass of frontage and the giant spire turned black and vanished from my eyes . Instead of sinking on the steps as I intended , I seemed to pitch headlong down an abyss . I remember no more . CHAPTER XVI . AULD LANG SYNE . Where my soul went during that swoon I can not tell . Whatever she saw , or wherever she travelled in her trance on that strange night she kept her own secret ; never whispering a word to Memory , and baffling imagination by an indissoluble silence . She may have gone upward , and come in sight of her eternal home , hoping for leave to rest now , and deeming that her painful union with matter was at last dissolved . While she so deemed , an angel may have warned her away from heaven 's threshold , and , guiding her weeping down , have bound her , once more , all shuddering and unwilling , to that poor frame , cold and wasted , of whose companionship she was grown more than weary . I know she re - entered her prison with pain , with reluctance , with a moan and a long shiver . The divorced mates , Spirit and Substance , were hard to re - unite : they greeted each other , not in an embrace , but a racking sort of struggle . The returning sense of sight came upon me , red , as if it swam in blood ; suspended hearing rushed back loud , like thunder ; consciousness revived in fear : I sat up appalled , wondering into what region , amongst what strange beings I was waking . At first I knew nothing I looked on : a wall was not a wall - a lamp not a lamp . I should have understood what we call a ghost , as well as I did the commonest object : which is another way of intimating that all my eye rested on struck it as spectral . But the faculties soon settled each in his place ; the life - machine presently resumed its wonted and regular working . Still , I knew not where I was ; only in time I saw I had been removed from the spot where I fell : I lay on no portico - step ; night and tempest were excluded by walls , windows , and ceiling . Into some house I had been carried - but what house ? I could only think of the pensionnat in the Rue Fossette . Still half- dreaming , I tried hard to discover in what room they had put me ; whether the great dormitory , or one of the little dormitories . I was puzzled , because I could not make the glimpses of furniture I saw accord with my knowledge of any of these apartments . The empty white beds were wanting , and the long line of large windows . "
78741	78745	77555	77555	you	1804	" thought I , "
78760	79071	78755	78755	they	1815	" And here my eye fell on an easy - chair covered with blue damask . Other seats , cushioned to match , dawned on me by degrees ; and at last I took in the complete fact of a pleasant parlour , with a wood fire on a clear - shining hearth , a carpet where arabesques of bright blue relieved a ground of shaded fawn ; pale walls over which a slight but endless garland of azure forget - me - nots ran mazed and bewildered amongst myriad gold leaves and tendrils . A gilded mirror filled up the space between two windows , curtained amply with blue damask . In this mirror I saw myself laid , not in bed , but on a sofa . I looked spectral ; my eyes larger and more hollow , my hair darker than was natural , by contrast with my thin and ashen face . It was obvious , not only from the furniture , but from the position of windows , doors , and fireplace , that this was an unknown room in an unknown house . Hardly less plain was it that my brain was not yet settled ; for , as I gazed at the blue arm - chair , it appeared to grow familiar ; so did a certain scroll - couch , and not less so the round centre - table , with a blue - covering , bordered with autumn - tinted foliage ; and , above all , two little footstools with worked covers , and a small ebony - framed chair , of which the seat and back were also worked with groups of brilliant flowers on a dark ground . Struck with these things , I explored further . Strange to say , old acquaintance were all about me , and "
79075	79106	78755	78755	they	1815	" smiled out of every nook . There were two oval miniatures over the mantel - piece , of which I knew by heart the pearls about the high and powdered "
79109	79329	78755	78755	they	1815	" the velvets circling the white throats ; the swell of the full muslin kerchiefs : the pattern of the lace sleeve - ruffles . Upon the mantel- shelf there were two china vases , some relics of a diminutive tea- service , as smooth as enamel and as thin as egg - shell , and a white centre ornament , a classic group in alabaster , preserved under glass . Of all these things I could have told the peculiarities , numbered the flaws or cracks , like any clairvoyante . Above all , there was a pair of handscreens , with elaborate pencil - drawings finished like line engravings ; these , my very eyes ached at beholding again , recalling hours when they had followed , stroke by stroke and touch by touch , a tedious , feeble , finical , school - girl pencil held in these fingers , now so skeleton - like . Where was I ? Not only in what spot of the world , but in what year of our Lord ? For all these objects were of past days , and of a distant country . Ten years ago I bade them good - by ; since my fourteenth year they and I had never met . I gasped audibly , "
79334	79720	79332	79332	I	0	" A shape hitherto unnoticed , stirred , rose , came forward : a shape inharmonious with the environment , serving only to complicate the riddle further . This was no more than a sort of native bonne , in a common - place bonne 's cap and print - dress . She spoke neither French nor English , and I could get no intelligence from her , not understanding her phrases of dialect . But she bathed my temples and forehead with some cool and perfumed water , and then she heightened the cushion on which I reclined , made signs that I was not to speak , and resumed her post at the foot of the sofa . She was busy knitting ; her eyes thus drawn from me , I could gaze on her without interruption . I did mightily wonder how she came there , or what she could have to do among the scenes , or with the days of my girlhood . Still more I marvelled what those scenes and days could now have to do with me . Too weak to scrutinize thoroughly the mystery , I tried to settle it by saying it was a mistake , a dream , a fever - fit ; and yet I knew there could be no mistake , and that I was not sleeping , and I believed I was sane . I wished the room had not been so well lighted , that I might not so clearly have seen the little pictures , the ornaments , the screens , the worked chair . All these objects , as well as the blue - damask furniture , were , in fact , precisely the same , in every minutest detail , with those I so well remembered , and with which I had been so thoroughly intimate , in the drawing - room of my godmother 's house at Bretton . Methought the apartment only was changed , being of different proportions and dimensions . I thought of Bedreddin Hassan , transported in his sleep from Cairo to the gates of Damascus . Had a Genius stooped his dark wing down the storm to whose stress I had succumbed , and gathering me from the church - steps , and "
79727	79986	79332	79332	I	0	" as the eastern tale said , had he borne me over land and ocean , and laid me quietly down beside a hearth of Old England ? But no ; I knew the fire of that hearth burned before its Lares no more - it went out long ago , and the household gods had been carried elsewhere . The bonne turned again to survey me , and seeing my eyes wide open , and , I suppose , deeming their expression perturbed and excited , she put down her knitting . I saw her busied for a moment at a little stand ; she poured out water , and measured drops from a phial : glass in hand , she approached me . What dark - tinged draught might she now be offering ? what Genii - elixir or Magi - distillation ? It was too late to inquire - I had swallowed it passively , and at once . A tide of quiet thought now came gently caressing my brain ; softer and softer rose the flow , with tepid undulations smoother than balm . The pain of weakness left my limbs , my muscles slept . I lost power to move ; but , losing at the same time wish , it was no privation . That kind bonne placed a screen between me and the lamp ; I saw her rise to do this , but do not remember seeing her resume her place : in the interval between the two acts , I "
79991	80053	79332	79332	I	0	" At waking , lo ! all was again changed . The light of high day surrounded me ; not , indeed , a warm , summer light , but the leaden gloom of raw and blustering autumn . I felt sure now that I was in the pensionnat - sure by the beating rain on the casement ; sure by the "
80055	80629	79332	79332	I	0	" of wind amongst trees , denoting a garden outside ; sure by the chill , the whiteness , the solitude , amidst which I lay . I say whiteness - for the dimity curtains , dropped before a French bed , bounded my view . I lifted them ; I looked out . My eye , prepared to take in the range of a long , large , and whitewashed chamber , blinked baffled , on encountering the limited area of a small cabinet - a cabinet with seagreen walls ; also , instead of five wide and naked windows , there was one high lattice , shaded with muslin festoons : instead of two dozen little stands of painted wood , each holding a basin and an ewer , there was a toilette - table dressed , like a lady for a ball , in a white robe over a pink skirt ; a polished and large glass crowned , and a pretty pin - cushion frilled with lace , adorned it . This toilette , together with a small , low , green and white chintz arm - chair , a washstand topped with a marble slab , and supplied with utensils of pale greenware , sufficiently furnished the tiny chamber . Reader ; I felt alarmed ! Why ? you will ask . What was there in this simple and somewhat pretty sleeping - closet to startle the most timid ? Merely this - These articles of furniture could not be real , solid arm- chairs , looking - glasses , and washstands - they must be the ghosts of such articles ; or , if this were denied as too wild an hypothesis - and , confounded as I was , I did deny it - there remained but to conclude that I had myself passed into an abnormal state of mind ; in short , that I was very ill and delirious : and even then , mine was the strangest figment with which delirium had ever harassed a victim . I knew - I was obliged to know - the green chintz of that little chair ; the little snug chair itself , the carved , shining - black , foliated frame of that glass ; the smooth , milky - green of the china vessels on the stand ; the very stand too , with its top of grey marble , splintered at one corner ; - all these I was compelled to recognise and to hail , as last night I had , perforce , recognised and hailed the rosewood , the drapery , the porcelain , of the drawing - room . Bretton ! Bretton ! and ten years ago shone reflected in that mirror . And why did Bretton and my fourteenth year haunt me thus ? Why , if they came at all , did they not return complete ? Why hovered before my distempered vision the mere furniture , while the rooms and the locality were gone ? As to that pincushion made of crimson satin , ornamented with gold beads and frilled with thread - lace , I had the same right to know it as to know the screens - I had made it myself . Rising with a start from the bed , I took the cushion in my hand and examined it . There was the cipher "
80633	80664	79332	79332	I	0	" formed in gold beds , and surrounded with an oval wreath embroidered in white silk . These were the initials of my godmother 's name - Lonisa Lucy Bretton . "
80675	81177	79332	79332	I	0	" I muttered ; and hastily pulling up the blind with which the lattice was shrouded , I looked out to try and discover where I was ; half - prepared to meet the calm , old , handsome buildings and clean grey pavement of St. Ann 's Street , and to see at the end the towers of the minster : or , if otherwise , fully expectant of a town view somewhere , a rue in Villette , if not a street in a pleasant and ancient English city . I looked , on the contrary , through a frame of leafage , clustering round the high lattice , and forth thence to a grassy mead - like level , a lawn - terrace with trees rising from the lower ground beyond - high forest - trees , such as I had not seen for many a day . They were now groaning under the gale of October , and between their trunks I traced the line of an avenue , where yellow leaves lay in heaps and drifts , or were whirled singly before the sweeping west wind . Whatever landscape might lie further must have been flat , and these tall beeches shut it out . The place seemed secluded , and was to me quite strange : I did not know it at all . Once more I lay down . My bed stood in a little alcove ; on turning my face to the wall , the room with its bewildering accompaniments became excluded . Excluded ? No ! For as I arranged my position in this hope , behold , on the green space between the divided and looped - up curtains , hung a broad , gilded picture - frame enclosing a portrait . It was drawn - well drawn , though but a sketch - in water - colours ; a head , a boy 's head , fresh , life - like , speaking , and animated . It seemed a youth of sixteen , fair - complexioned , with sanguine health in his cheek ; hair long , not dark , and with a sunny sheen ; penetrating eyes , an arch mouth , and a gay smile . On the whole a most pleasant face to look at , especially for , those claiming a right to that youth 's affections - parents , for instance , or sisters . Any romantic little school - girl might almost have loved it in its frame . Those eyes looked as if when somewhat older they would flash a lightning - response to love : I can not tell whether they kept in store the steady - beaming shine of faith . For whatever sentiment met him in form too facile , his lips menaced , beautifully but surely , caprice and light esteem . Striving to take each new discovery as quietly as I could , I whispered to myself - "
81270	81305	81253	81253	I	0	" I hardly believed fancy could improve on the curve of that mouth , or of the chin ; even my ignorance knew that both were beautiful , and pondered perplexed over this doubt : "
81324	81354	81253	81253	I	0	" Once , by way of test , I took little Missy Home , and , lifting her in my arms , told her to look at the picture . "
81362	81390	81253	81253	I	0	" I asked . She never answered , but gazed long , and at last a darkness went trembling through her sensitive eye , as she said , "
81395	81406	81253	81253	I	0	" So I put her down , saying to myself : "
81413	81425	81426	81426	He	4206	" All these things do I now think over , adding , "
81445	81455	81456	81456	Graham	135	" My reflections closed in an audibly pronounced word , "
81458	81459	81460	81460	Graham	135	" "
81462	81471	81460	81460	Graham	135	" echoed a sudden voice at the bedside . "
81477	81639	81473	81473	you	1818	" I looked . The plot was but thickening ; the wonder but culminating . If it was strange to see that well - remembered pictured form on the wall , still stranger was it to turn and behold the equally well - remembered living form opposite - a woman , a lady , most real and substantial , tall , well - attired , wearing widow 's silk , and such a cap as best became her matron and motherly braids of hair . Hers , too , was a good face ; too marked , perhaps , now for beauty , but not for sense or character . She was little changed ; something sterner , something more robust - but she was my godmother : still the distinct vision of Mrs. Bretton . I kept quiet , yet internally I was much agitated : my pulse fluttered , and the blood left my cheek , which turned cold . "
81646	81650	81473	81473	you	1818	" I inquired . "
81681	81682	81683	81683	I	0	" "

81821	81825	81826	81826	I	0	" She nodded . "
81840	81841	81829	81830	Mrs. Bretton	130	" "
81869	81870	81862	81863	my son	1825	" "
81882	81883	81873	81873	I	0	" "
81896	81900	81884	81885	My son	1825	" said she ; "
81923	82234	81862	81863	my son	1825	" Notwithstanding all I had undergone - the bodily fatigue , the perturbation of spirits , the exposure to weather - it seemed that I was better : the fever , the real malady which had oppressed my frame , was abating ; for , whereas during the last nine days I had taken no solid food , and suffered from continual thirst , this morning , on breakfast being offered , I experienced a craving for nourishment : an inward faintness which caused me eagerly to taste the tea this lady offered , and to eat the morsel of dry toast she allowed in accompaniment . It was only a morsel , but it sufficed ; keeping up my strength till some two or three hours afterwards , when the bonne brought me a little cup of broth and a biscuit . As evening began to darken , and the ceaseless blast still blew wild and cold , and the rain streamed on , deluge - like , I grew weary - very weary of my bed . The room , though pretty , was small : I felt it confining : I longed for a change . The increasing chill and gathering gloom , too , depressed me ; I wanted to see - to feel firelight . Besides , I kept thinking of the son of that tall matron : when should I see him ? Certainly not till I left my room . At last the bonne came to make my bed for the night . She prepared to wrap me in a blanket and place me in the little chintz chair ; but , declining these attentions , I proceeded to dress myself : The business was just achieved , and I was sitting down to take breath , when Mrs. Bretton once more appeared . "
82237	82258	81862	81863	my son	1825	" she exclaimed , smiling with that smile I so well knew - a pleasant smile , though not soft . "
82270	82383	82259	82259	You	1835	" She spoke to me so much as of old she used to speak that I almost fancied she was beginning to know me . There was the same sort of patronage in her voice and manner that , as a girl , I had always experienced from her - a patronage I yielded to and even liked ; it was not founded on conventional grounds of superior wealth or station in the last particular there had never been any inequality ; her degree was mine ; but on natural reasons of physical advantage : it was the shelter the tree gives the herb . I put a request without further ceremony . "
82402	82403	82404	82404	I	0	" "
82419	82424	82259	82259	You	1835	" was her reply . "
82433	82637	82259	82259	You	1835	" And she offered me hers : I took it , and we descended one flight of carpeted steps to a landing where a tall door , standing open , gave admission into the blue - damask room . How pleasant it was in its air of perfect domestic comfort ! How warm in its amber lamp - light and vermilion fire - flush ! To render the picture perfect , tea stood ready on the table - an English tea , whereof the whole shining service glanced at me familiarly ; from the solid silver urn , of antique pattern , and the massive pot of the same metal , to the thin porcelain cups , dark with purple and gilding . I knew the very seed - cake of peculiar form , baked in a peculiar mould , which always had a place on the tea - table at Bretton . Graham liked it , and there it was as of yore - set before Graham 's plate with the silver knife and fork beside it . Graham was then expected to tea : Graham was now , perhaps , in the house ; ere many minutes I might see him . "
82644	82867	82871	82871	his	1838	" said my conductress , as my step faltered a little in passing to the hearth . She seated me on the sofa , but I soon passed behind it , saying the fire was too hot ; in its shade I found another seat which suited me better . Mrs. Bretton was never wo nt to make a fuss about any person or anything ; without remonstrance she suffered me to have my own way . She made the tea , and she took up the newspaper . I liked to watch every action of my godmother ; all her movements were so young : she must have been now above fifty , yet neither her sinews nor her spirit seemed yet touched by the rust of age . Though portly , she was alert , and though serene , she was at times impetuous - good health and an excellent temperament kept her green as in her spring . While she read , I perceived she listened - listened for her son . She was not the woman ever to confess herself uneasy , but there was yet no lull in the weather , and if Graham were out in that hoarse wind - roaring still unsatisfied - I well knew his mother 's heart would be out with him . "
82874	83033	82871	82871	his	1838	" said she , looking at her watch ; then , in another minute , a lifting of her eyes from the page , and a slight inclination of her head towards the door , denoted that she heard some sound . Presently her brow cleared ; and then even my ear , less practised , caught the iron clash of a gate swung to , steps on gravel , lastly the door - bell . He was come . His mother filled the teapot from the urn , she drew nearer the hearth the stuffed and cushioned blue chair - her own chair by right , but I saw there was one who might with impunity usurp it . And when that one came up the stairs - which he soon did , after , I suppose , some such attention to the toilet as the wild and wet night rendered necessary , and strode straight in - "
83040	83053	83036	83036	you	1838	" said his mother , hiding a glad smile and speaking curtly . "
83062	83075	83060	83060	mamma	4272	" demanded the Unpunctual , possessing himself irreverently of the abdicated throne . "

83179	83222	83171	83171	she	1844	" said Mrs. Bretton , turning to my corner ; and at this invitation , forward I came . Graham courteously rose up to greet me . He stood tall on the hearth , a figure justifying his mother 's unconcealed pride . "
83229	83233	83224	83224	you	4272	" said he ; "
83338	83339	83332	83332	you	4272	" "
83343	83348	83332	83332	you	4272	" I said calmly . "
83359	83788	83356	83357	Dr. John	135	" For , reader , this tall young man - this darling son - this host of mine - this Graham Bretton , was Dr. John : he , and no other ; and , what is more , I ascertained this identity scarcely with surprise . What is more , when I heard Graham 's step on the stairs , I knew what manner of figure would enter , and for whose aspect to prepare my eyes . The discovery was not of to - day , its dawn had penetrated my perceptions long since . Of course I remembered young Bretton well ; and though ten years from sixteen to twenty - six may greatly change the boy as they mature him to the man , yet they could bring no such utter difference as would suffice wholly to blind my eyes , or baffle my memory . Dr. John Graham Bretton retained still an affinity to the youth of sixteen : he had his eyes ; he had some of his features ; to wit , all the excellently - moulded lower half of the face ; I found him out soon . I first recognised him on that occasion , noted several chapters back , when my unguardedly - fixed attention had drawn on me the mortification of an implied rebuke . Subsequent observation confirmed , in every point , that early surmise . I traced in the gesture , the port , and the habits of his manhood , all his boy 's promise . I heard in his now deep tones the accent of former days . Certain turns of phrase , peculiar to him of old , were peculiar to him still ; and so was many a trick of eye and lip , many a smile , many a sudden ray levelled from the irid , under his well - charactered brow . To say anything on the subject , to hint at my discovery , had not suited my habits of thought , or assimilated with my system of feeling . On the contrary , I had preferred to keep the matter to myself . I liked entering his presence covered with a cloud he had not seen through , while he stood before me under a ray of special illumination which shone all partial over his head , trembled about his feet , and cast light no farther . Well I knew that to him it could make little difference , were I to come forward and announce , "
83794	83823	83824	83824	Miss	1851	" So I kept back in my teacher 's place ; and as he never asked my name , so I never gave it . He heard me called "
83826	83828	83829	83830	Miss Lucy	142	" and "
83832	83839	83829	83830	Miss Lucy	142	" he never heard the surname , "
83842	83963	83840	83840	Snowe	142	" As to spontaneous recognition - though I , perhaps , was still less changed than he - the idea never approached his mind , and why should I suggest it ? During tea , Dr. John was kind , as it was his nature to be ; that meal over , and the tray carried out , he made a cosy arrangement of the cushions in a corner of the sofa , and obliged me to settle amongst them . He and his mother also drew to the fire , and ere we had sat ten minutes , I caught the eye of the latter fastened steadily upon me . Women are certainly quicker in some things than men . "
83966	83972	83840	83840	Snowe	142	" she exclaimed , presently , "
83988	83989	83984	83984	you	135	" "
84017	84018	84006	84006	One	607	" "
84033	84038	84041	84041	you	135	" pointing to me . "
84076	84077	84064	84064	she	4227	" "
84099	84100	84094	84094	she	4227	" "
84119	84120	84122	84122	you	135	" "
84157	84158	84148	84148	you	135	" "
84184	84185	84181	84181	you	135	" "
84193	84221	84191	84191	her	4227	" Graham did look : but this was not to be endured ; I saw how it must end , so I thought it best to anticipate . "
84225	84229	84222	84223	Dr. John	135	" I said , "
84285	84286	84282	84283	Lucy Snowe	142	" "
84298	84408	84409	84409	Mamma	150	" cried Mrs. Bretton . And she at once stepped across the hearth and kissed me . Some ladies would , perhaps , have made a great bustle upon such a discovery without being particularly glad of it ; but it was not my godmother 's habit to make a bustle , and she preferred all sentimental demonstrations in bas- relief . So she and I got over the surprise with few words and a single salute ; yet I daresay she was pleased , and I know I was . While we renewed old acquaintance , Graham , sitting opposite , silently disposed of his paroxysm of astonishment . "
84423	84429	84417	84417	I	0	" at length he said ; "
84483	84487	84488	84488	you	1861	" he added , "
84507	84508	84488	84488	you	1861	" "
84513	84640	84510	84510	I	0	" was my answer . Dr. John commented not . I supposed he regarded my silence as eccentric , but he was indulgent in refraining from censure . I daresay , too , he would have deemed it impertinent to have interrogated me very closely , to have asked me the why and wherefore of my reserve ; and , though he might feel a little curious , the importance of the case was by no means such as to tempt curiosity to infringe on discretion . For my part , I just ventured to inquire whether he remembered the circumstance of my once looking at him very fixedly ; for the slight annoyance he had betrayed on that occasion still lingered sore on my mind . "
84646	84650	84651	84651	I	0	" said he : "
84660	84661	84653	84653	I	0	" "
84671	84675	84662	84662	You	0	" I inquired . "

84722	85058	84711	84711	You	1863	" And here Mrs. Bretton broke in with many , many questions about past times ; and for her satisfaction I had to recur to gone - by troubles , to explain causes of seeming estrangement , to touch on single - handed conflict with Life , with Death , with Grief , with Fate . Dr. John listened , saying little . He and she then told me of changes they had known : even with them all had not gone smoothly , and fortune had retrenched her once abundant gifts . But so courageous a mother , with such a champion in her son , was well fitted to fight a good fight with the world , and to prevail ultimately . Dr. John himself was one of those on whose birth benign planets have certainly smiled . Adversity might set against him her most sullen front : he was the man to beat her down with smiles . Strong and cheerful , and firm and courteous ; not rash , yet valiant ; he was the aspirant to woo Destiny herself , and to win from her stone eyeballs a beam almost loving . In the profession he had adopted , his success was now quite decided . Within the last three months he had taken this house a small chateau , they told me , about half a league without the Porte de Crecy ; this country site being chosen for the sake of his mother 's health , with which town air did not now agree . Hither he had invited Mrs. Bretton , and she , on leaving England , had brought with her such residue furniture of the former St. Ann 's Street mansion as she had thought fit to keep unsold . Hence my bewilderment at the phantoms of chairs , and the wraiths of looking - glasses , tea - urns , and teacups . As the clock struck eleven , Dr. John stopped his mother . "
85065	85157	85160	85160	he	1864	" he said ; ' she is beginning to look very pale . To - morrow I will venture to put some questions respecting the cause of her loss of health . She is much changed , indeed , since last July , when I saw her enact with no little spirit the part of a very killing fine gentleman . As to last night 's catastrophe , I am sure thereby hangs a tale , but we will inquire no further this evening . Good - night , Miss Lucy . "
85273	85290	85291	85291	I	0	" Do not let me think of them too often , too much , too fondly , "
85294	85368	85291	85291	I	0	" let me be content with a temperate draught of this living stream : let me not run athirst , and apply passionately to its welcome waters : let me not imagine in them a sweeter taste than earth 's fountains know .

86238	86338	86226	86226	she	506	" and sit with you the whole day , if that overbearing John Graham had not put his veto upon such a proceeding . ' Now , mamma , ' he said , when he went out , ' take notice , you are not to knock up your god - daughter with gossip , ' and he particularly desired me to keep close to my own quarters , and spare you my fine company . He says , Lucy , he thinks you have had a nervous fever , judging from your look , - is that so ? "

87113	87252	87101	87101	he	532	" I do n't know whether you may have noticed it in your walks : though , indeed , from the chaussee it is not visible ; just a mile beyond the Porte de Crecy , you turn down a lane which soon becomes an avenue , and that leads you on , through meadow and shade , to the very door of this house . It is not a modern place , but built somewhat in the old style of the Basse - Ville . It is rather a manoir than a chateau ; they call it ' La Terrasse , ' because its front rises from a broad turfed walk , whence steps lead down a grassy slope to the avenue . See yonder ! The moon rises : she looks well through the tree- boles . "
87494	87509	87486	87486	I	0	" You know that Miss Fanshawe is gone on a tour with the Cholmondeleys , "

87617	87626	87628	87628	I.	0	" Oh ! all that is very conceivable , "
87629	87727	87628	87628	I.	0	" Goton could do nothing for me but bring me a little tisane and a crust of bread , and I had rejected both so often during the past week , that the good woman got tired of useless journeys from the dwelling - house kitchen to the school - dormitory , and only came once a day at noon to make my bed . I believe , however , that she is a good - natured creature , and would have been delighted to cook me cotelettes de mouton , if I could have eaten them . "

Cheerful society would be of use ; you should be as little alone as possible ; you should take plenty of exercise . "
87890	87894	87539	87539	he	1931	" Miss Snowe , "
87919	87936	87937	87937	I	0	" is it permitted me to ask what your religion is ? Are you a Catholic ? "
87944	87956	87937	87937	I	0	" A Catholic ? No ! Why suggest such an idea ? "
87957	87973	87937	87937	I	0	" The manner in which you were consigned to me last night made me doubt . "
87974	88001	87937	87937	I	0	" I consigned to you ? But , indeed , I forget . It yet remains for me to learn how I fell into your hands . "
88002	88259	88270	88270	he	1937	" Why , under circumstances that puzzled me . I had been in attendance all day yesterday on a case of singularly interesting and critical character ; the disease being rare , and its treatment doubtful : I saw a similar and still finer case in a hospital in Paris ; but that will not interest you . At last a mitigation of the patient 's most urgent symptoms acute pain is one of its accompaniments liberated me , and I set out homeward . My shortest way lay through the Basse - Ville , and as the night was excessively dark , wild , and wet , I took it . In riding past an old church belonging to a community of Beguines , I saw by a lamp burning over the porch or deep arch of the entrance , a priest lifting some object in his arms . The lamp was bright enough to reveal the priest 's features clearly , and I recognised him ; he was a man I have often met by the sick beds of both rich and poor : and chiefly the latter . He is , I think , a good old man , far better than most of his class in this country ; superior , indeed , in every way , better informed , as well as more devoted to duty . Our eyes met ; he called on me to stop : what he supported was a woman , fainting or dying . I alighted . "
88284	88316	88270	88270	he	1937	" My countrywoman , on examination , turned out to be the English teacher at Madame Beck 's pensionnat . She was perfectly unconscious , perfectly bloodless , and nearly cold . "
88329	88362	88270	88270	he	1937	" He communicated a curious account ; that you had been to him that evening at confessional ; that your exhausted and suffering appearance , coupled with some things you had said - "
88363	88374	88270	88270	he	1937	" Things I had said ? I wonder what things ! "
88375	88526	88270	88270	he	1937	" Awful crimes , no doubt ; but he did not tell me what : there , you know , the seal of the confessional checked his garrulity , and my curiosity . Your confidences , however , had not made an enemy of the good father ; it seems he was so struck , and felt so sorry that you should he out on such a night alone , that he had esteemed it a Christian duty to watch you when you quitted the church , and so to manage as not to lose sight of you , till you should have reached home . Perhaps the worthy man might , half unconsciously , have blent in this proceeding some little of the subtlety of his class : it might have been his resolve to learn the locality of your home - did you impart that in your confession ? "
88527	88752	88270	88270	he	1937	" I did not : on the contrary , I carefully avoided the shadow of any indication : and as to my confession , Dr. John , I suppose you will think me mad for taking such a step , but I could not help it : I suppose it was all the fault of what you call my ' nervous system . ' I can not put the case into words , but my days and nights were grown intolerable : a cruel sense of desolation pained my mind : a feeling that would make its way , rush out , or kill me - like and this you will understand , Dr. John the current which passes through the heart , and which , if aneurism or any other morbid cause obstructs its natural channels , seeks abnormal outlet . I wanted companionship , I wanted friendship , I wanted counsel . I could find none of these in closet or chamber , so I went and sought them in church and confessional . As to what I said , it was no confidence , no narrative . I have done nothing wrong : my life has not been active enough for any dark deed , either of romance or reality : all I poured out was a dreary , desperate complaint . "
88753	88796	88270	88270	he	1937	" Lucy , you ought to travel for about six months : why , your calm nature is growing quite excitable ! Confound Madame Beck ! Has the little buxom widow no bowels , to condemn her best teacher to solitary confinement ? "
88797	88806	88808	88808	I	0	" It was not Madame Beck 's fault , "
88810	88828	88808	88808	I	0	" it is no living being 's fault , and I wo n't hear any one blamed . "
88829	88840	88270	88270	he	1937	" Who is in the wrong , then , Lucy ? "
88841	88875	88270	88270	he	1937	" Me - Dr. John - me ; and a great abstraction on whose wide shoulders I like to lay the mountains of blame they were sculptured to bear : me and Fate . "
88876	88887	88889	88890	Dr. John	135	" ' Me ' must take better care in future , "
88902	88916	88918	88921	the practical young doctor	1938	" Change of air - change of scene ; those are my prescriptions , "
88923	88981	88918	88921	the practical young doctor	1938	" But to return to our muttons , Lucy . As yet , Pere Silas , with all his tact they say he is a Jesuit , is no wiser than you choose him to be ; for , instead of returning to the Rue Fossette , your fevered wanderings - there must have been high fever - "
88982	89012	88270	88270	he	1937	" No , Dr. John : the fever took its turn that night - now , do n't make out that I was delirious , for I know differently . "
89013	89221	88918	88921	the practical young doctor	1938	" Good ! you were as collected as myself at this moment , no doubt . Your wanderings had taken an opposite direction to the pensionnat . Near the Beguinage , amidst the stress of flood and gust , and in the perplexity of darkness , you had swooned and fallen . The priest came to your succour , and the physician , as we have seen , supervened . Between us we procured a fiacre and brought you here . Pere Silas , old as he is , would carry you up - stairs , and lay you on that couch himself . He would certainly have remained with you till suspended animation had been restored : and so should I , but , at that juncture , a hurried messenger arrived from the dying patient I had scarcely left - the last duties were called for - the physician 's last visit and the priest 's last rite ; extreme unction could not be deferred . Pere Silas and myself departed together , my mother was spending the evening abroad ; we gave you in charge to Martha , leaving directions , which it seems she followed successfully . Now , are you a Catholic ? "
89222	89226	89228	89228	I	0	" Not yet , "
89234	89297	89228	89228	I	0	" And never let Pere Silas know where I live , or he will try to convert me ; but give him my best and truest thanks when you see him , and if ever I get rich I will send him money for his charities . See , Dr. John , your mother wakes ; you ought to ring for tea . "
89344	89362	89336	89337	her son	532	" Hushaby , mamma ! Sleep again . You look the picture of innocence in your slumbers . "
89363	89392	89305	89306	Mrs. Bretton	130	" My slumbers , John Graham ! What are you talking about ? You know I never do sleep by day : it was the slightest doze possible . "
89393	89420	89305	89306	Mrs. Bretton	130	" Exactly ! a seraph 's gentle lapse - a fairy 's dream . Mamma , under such circumstances , you always remind me of Titania . "
89421	89434	89336	89337	her son	532	" That is because you , yourself , are so like Bottom . "
89435	89461	89305	89306	Mrs. Bretton	130	" Miss Snowe - did you ever hear anything like mamma 's wit ? She is a most sprightly woman of her size and age . "
89462	89545	89305	89306	Mrs. Bretton	130	" Keep your compliments to yourself , sir , and do not neglect your own size : which seems to me a good deal on the increase . Lucy , has he not rather the air of an incipient John Bull ? He used to be slender as an eel , and now I fancy in him a sort of heavy dragoon bent - a beef - eater tendency . Graham , take notice ! If you grow fat I disown you . "
89546	89605	89305	89306	Mrs. Bretton	130	" As if you could not sooner disown your own personality ! I am indispensable to the old lady 's happiness , Lucy . She would pine away in green and yellow melancholy if she had not my six feet of iniquity to scold . It keeps her lively - it maintains the wholesome ferment of her spirits . "
90045	90058	90081	90081	his	135	" Your friend is spending her vacation in travelling , I hear ? "
90059	90064	90066	90066	I	0	" Friend , forsooth ! "
90140	90159	90134	90134	he	135	" Ginevra - Miss Fanshawe , has accompanied the Cholmondeleys on a tour through the south of France ? "
90160	90164	90110	90110	he	135	" She has . "
90165	90172	90110	90110	he	135	" Do you and she correspond ? "
90173	90192	90110	90110	he	135	" It will astonish you to hear that I never once thought of making application for that privilege . "
90193	90202	90110	90110	he	135	" You have seen letters of her writing ? "
90203	90211	90110	90110	he	135	" Yes ; several to her uncle . "
90212	90237	90110	90110	he	135	" They will not be deficient in wit and naivete ; there is so much sparkle , and so little art in her soul ? "
90238	90257	90110	90110	he	135	" She writes comprehensively enough when she writes to M. de Bassompierre : he who runs may read . "
90278	90296	90110	90110	he	135	" And her handwriting ? It must be pretty , light , ladylike , I should think ? "
90305	90317	90319	90320	Dr. John	135	" I verily believe that all she does is well done , "
90338	90356	90336	90336	he	135	" You , who know her , could you name a point in which she is deficient ? "
90357	90365	90336	90336	he	135	" She does several things very well . "
90366	90372	90374	90374	I	0	" Flirtation amongst the rest , "
90379	90390	90391	90391	he	135	" When do you suppose she will return to town ? "
90395	90461	90462	90462	He	135	" Pardon me , Dr. John , I must explain . You honour me too much in ascribing to me a degree of intimacy with Miss Fanshawe I have not the felicity to enjoy . I have never been the depositary of her plans and secrets . You will find her particular friends in another sphere than mine : amongst the Cholmondeleys , for instance . "
90479	90483	90484	90484	he	135	" Excuse her , "
90487	90552	90484	90484	he	135	" judge her indulgently ; the glitter of fashion misleads her , but she will soon find out that these people are hollow , and will return to you with augmented attachment and confirmed trust . I know something of the Cholmondeleys : superficial , showy , selfish people ; depend on it , at heart Ginevra values you beyond a score of such . "
90553	90559	90560	90560	I	0	" You are very kind , "
90617	90623	90625	90625	Graham	135	" Yet , you see , "
90627	90669	90625	90625	Graham	135	" while I comfort you , I can not take the same consolation to myself ; I can not hope she will do me justice . De Hamal is most worthless , yet I fear he pleases her : wretched delusion ! "
90697	90701	90702	90702	I	0	" Dr. Bretton , "
90706	90766	90767	90767	I	0	" there is no delusion like your own . On all points but one you are a man , frank , healthful , right - thinking , clear - sighted : on this exceptional point you are but a slave . I declare , where Miss Fanshawe is concerned , you merit no respect ; nor have you mine . "
91069	91240	91244	91244	Lucy	142	" and , on any point , banned him from respect , he must now have peculiar feelings . That the epithet was well applied , and the ban just , might be ; he put forth no denial that it was so : his mind even candidly revolved that unmanning possibility . He sought in this accusation the cause of that ill - success which had got so galling a hold on his mental peace : Amid the worry of a self- condemnatory soliloquy , his demeanour seemed grave , perhaps cold , both to me and his mother . And yet there was no bad feeling , no malice , no rancour , no littleness in his countenance , beautiful with a man 's best beauty , even in its depression . When I placed his chair at the table , which I hastened to do , anticipating the servant , and when I handed him his tea , which I did with trembling care , he said : "
91246	91506	91242	91242	you	1966	" in as kindly a tone of his full pleasant voice as ever my ear welcomed . For my part , there was only one plan to be pursued ; I must expiate my culpable vehemence , or I must not sleep that night . This would not do at all ; I could not stand it : I made no pretence of capacity to wage war on this footing . School solitude , conventual silence and stagnation , anything seemed preferable to living embroiled with Dr. John . As to Ginevra , she might take the silver wings of a dove , or any other fowl that flies , and mount straight up to the highest place , among the highest stars , where her lover 's highest flight of fancy chose to fix the constellation of her charms : never more be it mine to dispute the arrangement . Long I tried to catch his eye . Again and again that eye just met mine ; but , having nothing to say , it withdrew , and I was baffled . After tea , he sat , sad and quiet , reading a book . I wished I could have dared to go and sit near him , but it seemed that if I ventured to take that step , he would infallibly evince hostility and indignation . I longed to speak out , and I dared not whisper . His mother left the room ; then , moved by insupportable regret , I just murmured the words "
91510	91563	91507	91508	Dr. Bretton	135	" He looked up from his book ; his eyes were not cold or malevolent , his mouth was not cynical ; he was ready and willing to hear what I might have to say : his spirit was of vintage too mellow and generous to sour in one thunder - clap . "
91578	91586	91564	91565	Dr. Bretton	135	" He smiled that moment I spoke . "
91643	91644	91638	91638	I	0	" "
91722	91723	91702	91702	you	142	" "

91876	92136	92137	92137	Ginevra	179	" Thus our quarrel ended . Reader , if in the course of this work , you find that my opinion of Dr. John undergoes modification , excuse the seeming inconsistency . I give the feeling as at the time I felt it ; I describe the view of character as it appeared when discovered . He showed the fineness of his nature by being kinder to me after that misunderstanding than before . Nay , the very incident which , by my theory , must in some degree estrange me and him , changed , indeed , somewhat our relations ; but not in the sense I painfully anticipated . An invisible , but a cold something , very slight , very transparent , but very chill : a sort of screen of ice had hitherto , all through our two lives , glazed the medium through which we exchanged intercourse . Those few warm words , though only warm with anger , breathed on that frail frost - work of reserve ; about this time , it gave note of dissolution . I think from that day , so long as we continued friends , he never in discourse stood on topics of ceremony with me . He seemed to know that if he would but talk about himself , and about that in which he was most interested , my expectation would always be answered , my wish always satisfied . It follows , as a matter of course , that I continued to hear much of "
92139	92140	92141	92141	Ginevra	179	" "
92143	92428	92141	92141	Ginevra	179	" He thought her so fair , so good ; he spoke so lovingly of her charms , her sweetness , her innocence , that , in spite of my plain prose knowledge of the reality , a kind of reflected glow began to settle on her idea , even for me . Still , reader , I am free to confess , that he often talked nonsense ; but I strove to be unfailingly patient with him . I had had my lesson : I had learned how severe for me was the pain of crossing , or grieving , or disappointing him . In a strange and new sense , I grew most selfish , and quite powerless to deny myself the delight of indulging his mood , and being pliant to his will . He still seemed to me most absurd when he obstinately doubted , and desponded about his power to win in the end Miss Fanshawe 's preference . The fancy became rooted in my own mind more stubbornly than ever , that she was only coquetting to goad him , and that , at heart , she coveted everyone of his words and looks . Sometimes he harassed me , in spite of my resolution to bear and hear ; in the midst of the indescribable gall - honey pleasure of thus bearing and hearing , he struck so on the flint of what firmness I owned , that it emitted fire once and again . I chanced to assert one day , with a view to stilling his impatience , that in my own mind , I felt positive Miss Fanshawe must intend eventually to accept him . "

92755	92769	92779	92779	she	179	" he said , destructively snipping a skein of silk with my scissors . "

92874	92937	92853	92853	she	179	" I laughed out : I had heard her adjudge to every jewel its price ; and well I knew money - embarrassment , money - schemes ; money 's worth , and endeavours to realise supplies , had , young as she was , furnished the most frequent , and the favourite stimulus of her thoughts for years . He pursued . "

93190	93360	93361	93361	Lucy	142	" but just then a blue subtle ray sped sideways from Dr. John 's eye : it reminded me of old days , it reminded me of his picture : it half led me to think that part , at least , of his professed persuasion of Miss Fanshawe 's naivete was assumed ; it led me dubiously to conjecture that perhaps , in spite of his passion for her beauty , his appreciation of her foibles might possibly be less mistaken , more clear - sighted , than from his general language was presumable . After all it might be only a chance look , or at best the token of a merely momentary impression . Chance or intentional real or imaginary , it closed the conversation . CHAPTER XIX . THE CLEOPATRA . My stay at La Terrasse was prolonged a fortnight beyond the close of the vacation . Mrs. Bretton 's kind management procured me this respite . Her son having one day delivered the dictum that "
93377	93496	93361	93361	Lucy	142	" she at once drove over to the Rue Fossette , had an interview with the directress , and procured the indulgence , on the plea of prolonged rest and change being necessary to perfect recovery . Hereupon , however , followed an attention I could very well have dispensed with , viz - a polite call from Madame Beck . That lady - one fine day - actually came out in a fiacre as far as the chateau . I suppose she had resolved within herself to see what manner of place Dr. John inhabited . Apparently , the pleasant site and neat interior surpassed her expectations ; she eulogized all she saw , pronounced the blue salon "
93501	93511	93361	93361	Lucy	142	" profusely congratulated me on the acquisition of friends , "
93520	93567	93361	93361	Lucy	142	" turned also a neat compliment in my favour , and , upon Dr. John coming in , ran up to him with the utmost buoyancy , opening at the same time such a fire of rapid language , all sparkling with felicitations and protestations about his "
93570	93572	93361	93361	Lucy	142	" - "
93581	93800	93361	93361	Lucy	142	" also his looks ; which , indeed , were very flourishing , and at the moment additionally embellished by the good - natured but amused smile with which he always listened to Madame 's fluent and florid French . In short , Madame shone in her very best phase that day , and came in and went out quite a living catherine - wheel of compliments , delight , and affability . Half purposely , and half to ask some question about school - business , I followed her to the carriage , and looked in after she was seated and the door closed . In that brief fraction of time what a change had been wrought ! An instant ago , all sparkles and jests , she now sat sterner than a judge and graver than a sage . Strange little woman ! I went back and teased Dr. John about Madame 's devotion to him . How he laughed ! What fun shone in his eyes as he recalled some of her fine speeches , and repeated them , imitating her voluble delivery ! He had an acute sense of humour , and was the finest company in the world - when he could forget Miss Fanshawe . To ' sit in sunshine calm and sweet "

96416	96427	96441	96442	M. Paul	196	" And he told you to look at that picture ? "
96428	96440	96348	96348	he	196	" By no means ; I found it out for myself . "

96511	96540	96491	96492	the Professor	2055	" Matter ! How dare you , a young person , sit coolly down , with the self- possession of a garcon , and look at that picture ? "
96541	96563	96491	96492	the Professor	2055	" It is a very ugly picture , but I can not at all see why I should not look at it "

96722	96738	96818	96818	Mariee	298	" indeed , they were ; being a set of four , denominated in the catalogue "
96744	96767	96818	96818	Mariee	298	" They were painted rather in a remarkable style - flat , dead , pale , and formal . The first represented a "
96771	96817	96818	96818	Mariee	298	" coming out of a church - door , a missal in her hand , her dress very prim , her eyes cast down , her mouth pursed up - the image of a most villanous little precocious she - hypocrite . The second , a "
96820	96864	96818	96818	Mariee	298	" with a long white veil , kneeling at a prie - dieu in her chamber , holding her hands plastered together , finger to finger , and showing the whites of her eyes in a most exasperating manner . The third , a "
96868	96890	96865	96866	Jeune Mere	299	" hanging disconsolate over a clayey and puffy baby with a face like an unwholesome full moon . The fourth , a "
96893	96932	96865	96866	Jeune Mere	299	" being a black woman , holding by the hand a black little girl , and the twain studiously surveying an elegant French monument , set up in a corner of some Pere la Chaise . All these four "
96934	97053	97227	97227	he	2060	" were grim and grey as burglars , and cold and vapid as ghosts . What women to live with ! insincere , ill - humoured , bloodless , brainless nonentities ! As bad in their way as the indolent gipsy - giantess , the Cleopatra , in hers . It was impossible to keep one 's attention long confined to these master - pieces , and so , by degrees , I veered round , and surveyed the gallery . A perfect crowd of spectators was by this time gathered round the Lioness , from whose vicinage I had been banished ; nearly half this crowd were ladies , but M. Paul afterwards told me , these were "
97057	97069	97227	97227	he	2060	" and it was quite proper for them to contemplate what no "
97071	97213	97227	97227	he	2060	" ought to glance at . I assured him plainly I could not agree in this doctrine , and did not see the sense of it ; whereupon , with his usual absolutism , he merely requested my silence , and also , in the same breath , denounced my mingled rashness and ignorance . A more despotic little man than M. Paul never filled a professor 's chair . I noticed , by the way , that he looked at the picture himself quite at his ease , and for a very long while : he did not , however , neglect to glance from time to time my way , in order , I suppose , to make sure that I was obeying orders , and not breaking bounds . By - and- by , he again accosted me . "
97220	97226	97227	97227	he	2060	" he wished to know : "

97300	97601	97298	97298	me	0	" He shrugged his shoulders ; varied and contradictory expressions played rapidly over his countenance . Marie Broc was well known to M. Paul ; he never gave a lesson in the third division containing the least advanced pupils , that she did not occasion in him a sharp conflict between antagonistic impressions . Her personal appearance , her repulsive manners , her often unmanageable disposition , irritated his temper , and inspired him with strong antipathy ; a feeling he was too apt to conceive when his taste was offended or his will thwarted . On the other hand , her misfortunes , constituted a strong claim on his forbearance and compassion - such a claim as it was not in his nature to deny ; hence resulted almost daily drawn battles between impatience and disgust on the one hand , pity and a sense of justice on the other ; in which , to his credit be it said , it was very seldom that the former feelings prevailed : when they did , however , M. Paul showed a phase of character which had its terrors . His passions were strong , his aversions and attachments alike vivid ; the force he exerted in holding both in check by no means mitigated an observer 's sense of their vehemence . With such tendencies , it may well be supposed he often excited in ordinary minds fear and dislike ; yet it was an error to fear him : nothing drove him so nearly frantic as the tremor of an apprehensive and distrustful spirit ; nothing soothed him like confidence tempered with gentleness . To evince these sentiments , however , required a thorough comprehension of his nature ; and his nature was of an order rarely comprehended . "
97611	97621	97622	97622	Monsieur	2064	" he asked , after some minutes ' silence . "

98276	98580	98581	98581	He	2085	" In fact , I had caught a glimpse of a head too pretty to belong to any other than the redoubted Colonel de Hamal . What a very finished , highly polished little pate it was ! What a figure , so trim and natty ! What womanish feet and hands ! How daintily he held a glass to one of his optics ! with what admiration he gazed upon the Cleopatra ! and then , how engagingly he tittered and whispered a friend at his elbow ! Oh , the man of sense ! Oh , the refined gentleman of superior taste and tact ! I observed him for about ten minutes , and perceived that he was exceedingly taken with this dusk and portly Venus of the Nile . So much was I interested in his bearing , so absorbed in divining his character by his looks and movements , I temporarily forgot M. Paul ; in the interim a group came between that gentleman and me ; or possibly his scruples might have received another and worse shock from my present abstraction , causing him to withdraw voluntarily : at any rate , when I again looked round , he was gone . My eye , pursuant of the search , met not him , but another and dissimilar figure , well seen amidst the crowd , for the height as well as the port lent each its distinction . This way came Dr. John , in visage , in shape , in hue , as unlike the dark , acerb , and caustic little professor , as the fruit of the Hesperides might be unlike the sloe in the wild thicket ; as the high - couraged but tractable Arabian is unlike the rude and stubborn ' sheltie .

102207	102889	102199	102199	she	190	" was a real world 's wonder - to be exceeded only by the fact of her actually pocketing slices she could not eat . Here be truths - wholesome truths , too . I knew another of these seraphs - the prettiest , or , at any rate , the least demure and hypocritical looking of the lot : she was seated by the daughter of an English peer , also an honest , though haughty- looking girl : both had entered in the suite of the British embassy . She i.e. my acquaintance had a slight , pliant figure , not at all like the forms of the foreign damsels : her hair , too , was not close - braided , like a shell or a skull - cap of satin ; it looked like hair , and waved from her head , long , curled , and flowing . She chatted away volubly , and seemed full of a light - headed sort of satisfaction with herself and her position . I did not look at Dr. Bretton ; but I knew that he , too , saw Ginevra Fanshawe : he had become so quiet , he answered so briefly his mother 's remarks , he so often suppressed a sigh . Why should he sigh ? He had confessed a taste for the pursuit of love under difficulties ; here was full gratification for that taste . His lady - love beamed upon him from a sphere above his own : he could not come near her ; he was not certain that he could win from her a look . I watched to see if she would so far favour him . Our seat was not far from the crimson benches ; we must inevitably be seen thence , by eyes so quick and roving as Miss Fanshawe 's , and very soon those optics of hers were upon us : at least , upon Dr. and Mrs. Bretton . I kept rather in the shade and out of sight , not wishing to be immediately recognised : she looked quite steadily at Dr. John , and then she raised a glass to examine his mother ; a minute or two afterwards she laughingly whispered her neighbour ; upon the performance commencing , her rambling attention was attracted to the platform . On the concert I need not dwell ; the reader would not care to have my impressions thereanent : and , indeed , it would not be worth while to record them , as they were the impressions of an ignorance crasse . The young ladies of the Conservatoire , being very much frightened , made rather a tremulous exhibition on the two grand pianos . M. Josef Emanuel stood by them while they played ; but he had not the tact or influence of his kinsman , who , under similar circumstances , would certainly have compelled pupils of his to demean themselves with heroism and self - possession . M. Paul would have placed the hysteric debutantes between two fires - terror of the audience , and terror of himself - and would have inspired them with the courage of desperation , by making the latter terror incomparably the greater : M. Josef could not do this . Following the white muslin pianistes , came a fine , full - grown , sulky lady in white satin . She sang . Her singing just affected me like the tricks of a conjuror : I wondered how she did it - how she made her voice run up and down , and cut such marvellous capers ; but a simple Scotch melody , played by a rude street minstrel , has often moved me more deeply . Afterwards stepped forth a gentleman , who , bending his body a good deal in the direction of the King and Queen , and frequently approaching his white - gloved hand to the region of his heart , vented a bitter outcry against a certain "
102893	103098	102891	102891	Isabelle	221	" I thought he seemed especially to solicit the Queen 's sympathy ; but , unless I am egregiously mistaken , her Majesty lent her attention rather with the calm of courtesy than the earnestness of interest . This gentleman 's state of mind was very harrowing , and I was glad when he wound up his musical exposition of the same . Some rousing choruses struck me as the best part of the evening 's entertainment . There were present deputies from all the best provincial choral societies ; genuine , barrel - shaped , native Labassecouriens . These worthies gave voice without mincing the matter their hearty exertions had at least this good result - the ear drank thence a satisfying sense of power . Through the whole performance - timid instrumental duets , conceited vocal solos , sonorous , brass - lunged choruses - my attention gave but one eye and one ear to the stage , the other being permanently retained in the service of Dr. Bretton : I could not forget him , nor cease to question how he was feeling , what he was thinking , whether he was amused or the contrary . At last he spoke . "
103114	103124	103109	103109	You	2201	" he said , in his own cheerful tone . "

I did not then know that he had witnessed double cause for dissatisfaction with Miss Fanshawe . The glow of his complexion , the expansion of his nostril , the bold curve which disdain gave his well - cut under lip , showed him in a new and striking phase . Yet the rare passion of the constitutionally suave and serene , is not a pleasant spectacle ; nor did I like the sort of vindictive thrill which passed through his strong young frame . "

104502	104954	104464	104464	you	2233	" came next : the interval between was one of general relaxation , and the pleasantest imaginable stir and commotion . The white flock was cleared from the platform ; a busy throng of gentlemen crowded it instead , making arrangements for the drawing ; and amongst these - the busiest of all - re - appeared that certain well - known form , not tall but active , alive with the energy and movement of three tall men . How M. Paul did work ! How he issued directions , and , at the same time , set his own shoulder to the wheel ! Half - a - dozen assistants were at his beck to remove the pianos , c. ; no matter , he must add to their strength his own . The redundancy of his alertness was half - vexing , half - ludicrous : in my mind I both disapproved and derided most of this fuss . Yet , in the midst of prejudice and annoyance , I could not , while watching , avoid perceiving a certain not disagreeable naivete in all he did and said ; nor could I be blind to certain vigorous characteristics of his physiognomy , rendered conspicuous now by the contrast with a throng of tamer faces : the deep , intent keenness of his eye , the power of his forehead , pale , broad , and full - the mobility of his most flexible mouth . He lacked the calm of force , but its movement and its fire he signally possessed . Meantime the whole hall was in a stir ; most people rose and remained standing , for a change ; some walked about , all talked and laughed . The crimson compartment presented a peculiarly animated scene . The long cloud of gentlemen , breaking into fragments , mixed with the rainbow line of ladies ; two or three officer - like men approached the King and conversed with him . The Queen , leaving her chair , glided along the rank of young ladies , who all stood up as she passed ; and to each in turn I saw her vouchsafe some token of kindness - a gracious word , look or smile . To the two pretty English girls , Lady Sara and Ginevra Fanshawe , she addressed several sentences ; as she left them , both , and especially the latter , seemed to glow all over with gratification . They were afterwards accosted by several ladies , and a little circle of gentlemen gathered round them ; amongst these - the nearest to Ginevra - stood the Count de Hamal . "
104961	104971	104464	104464	you	2233	" said Dr. Bretton , rising with sudden impatience . "

105007	105095	105096	105096	You	142	" Willingly would I have kept mine also , but Graham 's desire must take precedence of my own ; I accompanied him . We found the night - air keen ; or at least I did : he did not seem to feel it ; but it was very still , and the star - sown sky spread cloudless . I was wrapped in a fur shawl . We took some turns on the pavement ; in passing under a lamp , Graham encountered my eye . "

105422	105676	105685	105685	Lucy	142	" We did not easily regain our seats ; the lottery was begun , and all was excited confusion ; crowds blocked the sort of corridor along which we had to pass : it was necessary to pause for a time . Happening to glance round - indeed I half fancied I heard my name pronounced - I saw quite near , the ubiquitous , the inevitable M. Paul . He was looking at me gravely and intently : at me , or rather at my pink dress - sardonic comment on which gleamed in his eye . Now it was his habit to indulge in strictures on the dress , both of the teachers and pupils , at Madame Beck 's - a habit which the former , at least , held to be an offensive impertinence : as yet I had not suffered from it - my sombre daily attire not being calculated to attract notice . I was in no mood to permit any new encroachment to - night : rather than accept his banter , I would ignore his presence , and accordingly steadily turned my face to the sleeve of Dr. John 's coat ; finding in that same black sleeve a prospect more redolent of pleasure and comfort , more genial , more friendly , I thought , than was offered by the dark little Professor 's unlovely visage . Dr. John seemed unconsciously to sanction the preference by looking down and saying in his kind voice , "
105696	105809	105812	105812	you	142	" I could not , however , be true to myself . Yielding to some influence , mesmeric or otherwise - an influence unwelcome , displeasing , but effective - I again glanced round to see if M. Paul was gone . No , there he stood on the same spot , looking still , but with a changed eye ; he had penetrated my thought , and read my wish to shun him . The mocking but not ill - humoured gaze was turned to a swarthy frown , and when I bowed , with a view to conciliation , I got only the stiffest and sternest of nods in return . "
105818	105825	105812	105812	you	142	" whispered Dr. Bretton , smiling . "
105836	105837	105838	105845	One of the professors at Madame Beck 's	2260	" "

105934	105999	106002	106002	he	2263	" began Dr. John : I know not what more he would have added , for at that moment I was nearly thrown down amongst the feet of the crowd . M. Paul had rudely pushed past , and was elbowing his way with such utter disregard to the convenience and security of all around , that a very uncomfortable pressure was the consequence . "
106013	106700	106002	106002	he	2263	" said Dr. Bretton . I thought so , too . Slowly and with difficulty we made our way along the passage , and at last regained our seats . The drawing of the lottery lasted nearly an hour ; it was an animating and amusing scene ; and as we each held tickets , we shared in the alternations of hope and fear raised by each turn of the wheel . Two little girls , of five and six years old , drew the numbers : and the prizes were duly proclaimed from the platform . These prizes were numerous , though of small value . It so fell out that Dr. John and I each gained one : mine was a cigar - case , his a lady 's head - dress - a most airy sort of blue and silver turban , with a streamer of plumage on one side , like a snowy cloud . He was excessively anxious to make an exchange ; but I could not be brought to hear reason , and to this day I keep my cigar - case : it serves , when I look at it , to remind me of old times , and one happy evening . Dr. John , for his part , held his turban at arm 's length between his finger and thumb , and looked at it with a mixture of reverence and embarrassment highly provocative of laughter . The contemplation over , he was about coolly to deposit the delicate fabric on the ground between his feet ; he seemed to have no shadow of an idea of the treatment or stowage it ought to receive : if his mother had not come to the rescue , I think he would finally have crushed it under his arm like an opera - hat ; she restored it to the band - box whence it had issued . Graham was quite cheerful all the evening , and his cheerfulness seemed natural and unforced . His demeanour , his look , is not easily described ; there was something in it peculiar , and , in its way , original . I read in it no common mastery of the passions , and a fund of deep and healthy strength which , without any exhausting effort , bore down Disappointment and extracted her fang . His manner , now , reminded me of qualities I had noticed in him when professionally engaged amongst the poor , the guilty , and the suffering , in the Basse- Ville : he looked at once determined , enduring , and sweet - tempered . Who could help liking him ? He betrayed no weakness which harassed all your feelings with considerations as to how its faltering must be propped ; from him broke no irritability which startled calm and quenched mirth ; his lips let fall no caustic that burned to the bone ; his eye shot no morose shafts that went cold , and rusty , and venomed through your heart : beside him was rest and refuge - around him , fostering sunshine . And yet he had neither forgiven nor forgotten Miss Fanshawe . Once angered , I doubt if Dr. Bretton were to be soon propitiated - once alienated , whether he were ever to be reclaimed . He looked at her more than once ; not stealthily or humbly , but with a movement of hardy , open observation . De Hamal was now a fixture beside her ; Mrs. Cholmondeley sat near , and they and she were wholly absorbed in the discourse , mirth , and excitement , with which the crimson seats were as much astir as any plebeian part of the hall . In the course of some apparently animated discussion , Ginevra once or twice lifted her hand and arm ; a handsome bracelet gleamed upon the latter . I saw that its gleam flickered in Dr. John 's eye - quickening therein a derisive , ireful sparkle ; he laughed : - - "

107651	107803	108149	108149	Lucy	142	" succeeding to the King and Queen 's departure , Mrs. Bretton preceded us , and promptly made us a lane through the crowd . Graham followed , apostrophizing his mother as the most flourishing grisette it had ever been his good fortune to see charged with carriage of a bandbox ; he also desired me to mark her affection for the sky - blue turban , and announced his conviction that she intended one day to wear it . The night was now very cold and very dark , but with little delay we found the carriage . Soon we were packed in it , as warm and as snug as at a fire - side ; and the drive home was , I think , still pleasanter than the drive to the concert . Pleasant it was , even though the coachman - having spent in the shop of a "
107807	108148	108149	108149	Lucy	142	" a portion of the time we passed at the concert - drove us along the dark and solitary chaussee far past the turn leading down to La Terrasse ; we , who were occupied in talking and laughing , not noticing the aberration till , at last , Mrs. Bretton intimated that , though she had always thought the chateau a retired spot , she did not know it was situated at the world 's end , as she declared seemed now to be the case , for she believed we had been an hour and a half en route , and had not yet taken the turn down the avenue . Then Graham looked out , and perceiving only dim - spread fields , with unfamiliar rows of pollards and limes ranged along their else invisible sunk - fences , began to conjecture how matters were , and calling a halt and descending , he mounted the box and took the reins himself . Thanks to him , we arrived safe at home about an hour and a half beyond our time . Martha had not forgotten us ; a cheerful fire was burning , and a neat supper spread in the dining - room : we were glad of both . The winter dawn was actually breaking before we gained our chambers . I took off my pink dress and lace mantle with happier feelings than I had experienced in putting them on . Not all , perhaps , who had shone brightly arrayed at that concert could say the same ; for not all had been satisfied with friendship - with its calm comfort and modest hope . CHAPTER XXI . REACTION . Yet three days , and then I must go back to the pensionnat . I almost numbered the moments of these days upon the clock ; fain would I have retarded their flight ; but they glided by while I watched them : they were already gone while I yet feared their departure . "
108158	108177	108149	108149	Lucy	142	" said Mrs. Bretton , coaxingly at breakfast ; ' she knows we can procure a second respite . "

108873	109009	109060	109060	his	135	" He was gone . The heavy door crashed to : the axe had fallen - the pang was experienced . Allowing myself no time to think or feel - swallowing tears as if they had been wine - I passed to Madame 's sitting - room to pay the necessary visit of ceremony and respect . She received me with perfectly well- acted cordiality - was even demonstrative , though brief , in her welcome . In ten minutes I was dismissed . From the salle - a - manger I proceeded to the refectory , where pupils and teachers were now assembled for evening study : again I had a welcome , and one not , I think , quite hollow . That over , I was free to repair to the dormitory . "

109389	109998	109381	109381	I	0	" declared Reason . I groaned under her bitter sternness . Never - never - oh , hard word ! This hag , this Reason , would not let me look up , or smile , or hope : she could not rest unless I were altogether crushed , cowed , broken - in , and broken - down . According to her , I was born only to work for a piece of bread , to await the pains of death , and steadily through all life to despond . Reason might be right ; yet no wonder we are glad at times to defy her , to rush from under her rod and give a truant hour to Imagination - her soft , bright foe , our sweet Help , our divine Hope . We shall and must break bounds at intervals , despite the terrible revenge that awaits our return . Reason is vindictive as a devil : for me she was always envenomed as a step - mother . If I have obeyed her it has chiefly been with the obedience of fear , not of love . Long ago I should have died of her ill - usage her stint , her chill , her barren board , her icy bed , her savage , ceaseless blows ; but for that kinder Power who holds my secret and sworn allegiance . Often has Reason turned me out by night , in mid - winter , on cold snow , flinging for sustenance the gnawed bone dogs had forsaken : sternly has she vowed her stores held nothing more for me - harshly denied my right to ask better things .... Then , looking up , have I seen in the sky a head amidst circling stars , of which the midmost and the brightest lent a ray sympathetic and attent . A spirit , softer and better than Human Reason , has descended with quiet flight to the waste - bringing all round her a sphere of air borrowed of eternal summer ; bringing perfume of flowers which can not fade - fragrance of trees whose fruit is life ; bringing breezes pure from a world whose day needs no sun to lighten it . My hunger has this good angel appeased with food , sweet and strange , gathered amongst gleaning angels , garnering their dew- white harvest in the first fresh hour of a heavenly day ; tenderly has she assuaged the insufferable fears which weep away life itself - kindly given rest to deadly weariness - generously lent hope and impulse to paralyzed despair . Divine , compassionate , succourable influence ! When I bend the knee to other than God , it shall be at thy white and winged feet , beautiful on mountain or on plain . Temples have been reared to the Sun - altars dedicated to the Moon . Oh , greater glory ! To thee neither hands build , nor lips consecrate : but hearts , through ages , are faithful to thy worship . A dwelling thou hast , too wide for walls , too high for dome - a temple whose floors are space - rites whose mysteries transpire in presence , to the kindling , the harmony of worlds ! Sovereign complete ! thou hadst , for endurance , thy great army of martyrs ; for achievement , thy chosen band of worthies . Deity unquestioned , thine essence foils decay ! This daughter of Heaven remembered me to - night ; she saw me weep , and she came with comfort : "
110001	110005	109381	109381	I	0	" she said . "
110015	110761	110010	110010	I	0	" She kept her word , and watched me through a night 's rest ; but at dawn Reason relieved the guard . I awoke with a sort of start ; the rain was dashing against the panes , and the wind uttering a peevish cry at intervals ; the night - lamp was dying on the black circular stand in the middle of the dormitory : day had already broken . How I pity those whom mental pain stuns instead of rousing ! This morning the pang of waking snatched me out of bed like a hand with a giant 's gripe . How quickly I dressed in the cold of the raw dawn ! How deeply I drank of the ice- cold water in my carafe ! This was always my cordial , to which , like other dram - drinkers , I had eager recourse when unsettled by chagrin . Ere long the bell rang its reveillee to the whole school . Being dressed , I descended alone to the refectory , where the stove was lit and the air was warm ; through the rest of the house it was cold , with the nipping severity of a continental winter : though now but the beginning of November , a north wind had thus early brought a wintry blight over Europe : I remember the black stoves pleased me little when I first came ; but now I began to associate with them a sense of comfort , and liked them , as in England we like a fireside . Sitting down before this dark comforter , I presently fell into a deep argument with myself on life and its chances , on destiny and her decrees . My mind , calmer and stronger now than last night , made for itself some imperious rules , prohibiting under deadly penalties all weak retrospect of happiness past ; commanding a patient journeying through the wilderness of the present , enjoining a reliance on faith - a watching of the cloud and pillar which subdue while they guide , and awe while they illumine - hushing the impulse to fond idolatry , checking the longing out - look for a far - off promised land whose rivers are , perhaps , never to be , reached save in dying dreams , whose sweet pastures are to be viewed but from the desolate and sepulchral summit of a Nebo . By degrees , a composite feeling of blended strength and pain wound itself wirily round my heart , sustained , or at least restrained , its throbbings , and made me fit for the day 's work . I lifted my head . As I said before , I was sitting near the stove , let into the wall beneath the refectory and the carre , and thus sufficing to heat both apartments . Piercing the same wall , and close beside the stove , was a window , looking also into the carre ; as I looked up a cap - tassel , a brow , two eyes , filled a pane of that window ; the fixed gaze of those two eyes hit right against my own glance : they were watching me . I had not till that moment known that tears were on my cheek , but I felt them now . This was a strange house , where no corner was sacred from intrusion , where not a tear could be shed , nor a thought pondered , but a spy was at hand to note and to divine . And this new , this out - door , this male spy , what business had brought him to the premises at this unwonted hour ? What possible right had he to intrude on me thus ? No other professor would have dared to cross the carre before the class - bell rang . M. Emanuel took no account of hours nor of claims : there was some book of reference in the first - class library which he had occasion to consult ; he had come to seek it : on his way he passed the refectory . It was very much his habit to wear eyes before , behind , and on each side of him : he had seen me through the little window - he now opened the refectory door , and there he stood . "

111612	111660	111610	111610	she	179	" I expected as much : it would not be you if you did not snub one . But now , come , grand - mother , I hope you like coffee as much , and pistolets as little as ever : are you disposed to barter ? "
111661	111667	111674	111674	she	179	" Take your own way . "

112629	112694	112579	112580	Ginevra Fanshawe	179	" Not till I have had a talk with you , chere amie . I know where you have been spending your vacation , and how you have commenced sacrificing to the graces , and enjoying life like any other belle . I saw you at the concert the other night , dressed , actually , like anybody else . Who is your tailleuse ? "
112695	112727	112594	112594	She	179	" Tittle - tattle : how prettily it begins ! My tailleuse ! - a fiddlestick ! Come , sheer off , Ginevra . I really do n't want your company . "
112728	112779	112613	112613	I	0	" But when I want yours so much , ange farouche , what does a little reluctance on your part signify ? Dieu merci ! we know how to manoeuvre with our gifted compatriote - the learned ' ourse Britannique . ' And so , Ourson , you know Isidore ? "
112780	112786	112579	112580	Ginevra Fanshawe	179	" I know John Bretton . "
112787	112792	112594	112594	She	179	" Oh , hush ! "
112799	112851	112594	112594	She	179	" you crack my tympanums with your rude Anglicisms . But , how is our well - beloved John ? Do tell me about him . The poor man must be in a sad way . What did he say to my behaviour the other night ? Was n't I cruel ? "
112852	112860	112579	112580	Ginevra Fanshawe	179	" Do you think I noticed you ? "
112861	112917	112594	112594	She	179	" It was a delightful evening . Oh , that divine de Hamal ! And then to watch the other sulking and dying in the distance ; and the old lady - my future mamma - in - law ! But I am afraid I and Lady Sara were a little rude in quizzing her . "
112918	112949	112594	112594	She	179	" Lady Sara never quizzed her at all ; and for what you did , do n't make yourself in the least uneasy : Mrs. Bretton will survive your sneer . "
112950	112981	112594	112594	She	179	" She may : old ladies are tough ; but that poor son of hers ! Do tell me what he said : I saw he was terribly cut up . "
112982	112998	112594	112594	She	179	" He said you looked as if at heart you were already Madame de Hamal . "
112999	113003	113004	113004	she	2342	" Did he ? "
113009	113026	113004	113004	she	2342	" He noticed that ? How charming ! I thought he would be mad with jealousy ? "
113027	113047	112594	112594	She	179	" Ginevra , have you seriously done with Dr. Bretton ? Do you want him to give you up ? "
113048	113065	112594	112594	She	179	" Oh ! you know he ca n't do that : but was n't he mad ? "
113066	113070	113071	113071	I	0	" Quite mad , "
113074	113082	113071	113071	I	0	" as mad as a March hare . "

113096	113149	112594	112594	She	179	" How ever , indeed ! Have you no pity on his poor mother and me ? Fancy us holding him tight down in the carriage , and he raving between us , fit to drive everybody delirious . The very coachman went wrong , somehow , and we lost our way . "
113150	113168	113071	113071	I	0	" You do n't say so ? You are laughing at me . Now , Lucy Snowe - "
113169	113202	112594	112594	She	179	" I assure you it is fact - and fact , also , that Dr. Bretton would not stay in the carriage : he broke from us , and would ride outside . "
113203	113207	112594	112594	She	179	" And afterwards ? "
113208	113222	113071	113071	I	0	" Afterwards - when he did reach home - the scene transcends description . "
113223	113237	113071	113071	I	0	" Oh , but describe it - you know it is such fun ! "
113238	113247	112594	112594	She	179	" Fun for you , Miss Fanshawe ? but "

113604	113605	113602	113602	March	321	" "
113609	113785	113786	113786	I	0	" said she ; but she obeyed : and , indeed , the first classe was my territory , and she could not there legally resist a notice of quittance from me . Yet , to speak the truth , never had I been less dissatisfied with her than I was then . There was pleasure in thinking of the contrast between the reality and my description - to remember Dr. John enjoying the drive home , eating his supper with relish , and retiring to rest with Christian composure . It was only when I saw him really unhappy that I felt really vexed with the fair , frail cause of his suffering . A fortnight passed ; I was getting once more inured to the harness of school , and lapsing from the passionate pain of change to the palsy of custom . One afternoon , in crossing the carre , on my way to the first classe , where I was expected to assist at a lesson of ' style and literature , "
113821	114179	113814	113814	She	203	" one of her hands rested in her apron- pocket , the other at this moment held to her eyes a letter , whereof Mademoiselle coolly perused the address , and deliberately studied the seal . A letter ! The shape of a letter similar to that had haunted my brain in its very core for seven days past . I had dreamed of a letter last night . Strong magnetism drew me to that letter now ; yet , whether I should have ventured to demand of Rosine so much as a glance at that white envelope , with the spot of red wax in the middle , I know not . No ; I think I should have sneaked past in terror of a rebuff from Disappointment : my heart throbbed now as if I already heard the tramp of her approach . Nervous mistake ! It was the rapid step of the Professor of Literature measuring the corridor . I fled before him . Could I but be seated quietly at my desk before his arrival , with the class under my orders all in disciplined readiness , he would , perhaps , exempt me from notice ; but , if caught lingering in the carre , I should be sure to come in for a special harangue . I had time to get seated , to enforce perfect silence , to take out my work , and to commence it amidst the profoundest and best trained hush , ere M. Emanuel entered with his vehement burst of latch and panel , and his deep , redundant bow , prophetic of choler . As usual he broke upon us like a clap of thunder ; but instead of flashing lightning - wise from the door to the estrade , his career halted midway at my desk . Setting his face towards me and the window , his back to the pupils and the room , he gave me a look - such a look as might have licensed me to stand straight up and demand what he meant - a look of scowling distrust . "
114185	114363	113814	113814	She	203	" said he , drawing his hand from his waist - coat , and placing on my desk a letter - the very letter I had seen in Rosine 's hand - the letter whose face of enamelled white and single Cyclop's - eye of vermilion - red had printed themselves so clear and perfect on the retina of an inward vision . I knew it , I felt it to be the letter of my hope , the fruition of my wish , the release from my doubt , the ransom from my terror . This letter M. Paul , with his unwarrantably interfering habits , had taken from the portress , and now delivered it himself . I might have been angry , but had not a second for the sensation . Yes : I held in my hand not a slight note , but an envelope , which must , at least , contain a sheet : it felt not flimsy , but firm , substantial , satisfying . And here was the direction , "
114368	114406	114364	114366	Miss Lucy Snowe	142	" in a clean , clear , equal , decided hand ; and here was the seal , round , full , deftly dropped by untremulous fingers , stamped with the well - cut impress of initials , "
114410	114664	114666	114666	you	2349	" I experienced a happy feeling - a glad emotion which went warm to my heart , and ran lively through all my veins . For once a hope was realized . I held in my hand a morsel of real solid joy : not a dream , not an image of the brain , not one of those shadowy chances imagination pictures , and on which humanity starves but can not live ; not a mess of that manna I drearily eulogized awhile ago - which , indeed , at first melts on the lips with an unspeakable and preternatural sweetness , but which , in the end , our souls full surely loathe ; longing deliriously for natural and earth - grown food , wildly praying Heaven 's Spirits to reclaim their own spirit - dew and essence - an aliment divine , but for mortals deadly . It was neither sweet hail nor small coriander - seed - neither slight wafer , nor luscious honey , I had lighted on ; it was the wild , savoury mess of the hunter , nourishing and salubrious meat , forest - fed or desert - reared , fresh , healthful , and life - sustaining . It was what the old dying patriarch demanded of his son Esau , promising in requital the blessing of his last breath . It was a godsend ; and I inwardly thanked the God who had vouchsafed it . Outwardly I only thanked man , crying , "
114673	115005	114671	114671	Monsieur	2350	" Monsieur curled his lip , gave me a vicious glance of the eye , and strode to his estrade . M. Paul was not at all a good little man , though he had good points . Did I read my letter there and then ? Did I consume the venison at once and with haste , as if Esau 's shaft flew every day ? I knew better . The cover with its address - the seal , with its three clear letters - was bounty and abundance for the present . I stole from the room , I procured the key of the great dormitory , which was kept locked by day . I went to my bureau ; with a sort of haste and trembling lest Madame should creep up - stairs and spy me , I opened a drawer , unlocked a box , and took out a case , and - having feasted my eyes with one more look , and approached the seal with a mixture of awe and shame and delight , to my lips - I folded the untasted treasure , yet all fair and inviolate , in silver paper , committed it to the case , shut up box and drawer , reclosed , relocked the dormitory , and returned to class , feeling as if fairy tales were true , and fairy gifts no dream . Strange , sweet insanity ! And this letter , the source of my joy , I had not yet read : did not yet know the number of its lines . When I re - entered the schoolroom , behold M. Paul raging like a pestilence ! Some pupil had not spoken audibly or distinctly enough to suit his ear and taste , and now she and others were weeping , and he was raving from his estrade , almost livid . Curious to mention , as I appeared , he fell on me . "
115160	115187	115147	115147	himself	2354	" What could I say to all this ? Really nothing ; and I hoped he would allow me to be silent . The storm recommenced . "
115299	115419	115291	115291	they	2363	" Lull the second - the girls , not one of whom was ever known to weep a tear for the rebukes of any other master , now all melting like snow- statues before the intemperate heat of M. Emanuel : I not yet much shaken , sitting down , and venturing to resume my work . Something - either in my continued silence or in the movement of my hand , stitching - transported M. Emanuel beyond the last boundary of patience ; he actually sprang from his estrade . The stove stood near my desk , he attacked it ; the little iron door was nearly dashed from its hinges , the fuel was made to fly . "
115430	115466	115291	115291	they	2363	" said he to me , in a low , furious voice , as he thus outraged , under pretence of arranging the fire . It was time to soothe him a little if possible . "
115471	115475	115469	115469	Monsieur	1465	" said I , "
115498	115569	115490	115490	you	1465	" I did not intend my voice to falter , but it did : more , I think , through the agitation of late delight than in any spasm of present fear . Still there certainly was something in M. Paul 's anger - a kind of passion of emotion - that specially tended to draw tears . I was not unhappy , nor much afraid , yet I wept . "
115574	115587	115570	115570	Allons	322	" said he presently , looking round and seeing the deluge universal . "
115605	115609	115597	115597	I	0	" he added , "
115635	115850	115632	115633	Miss Lucy	142	" And he took forth and held out to me a clean silk handkerchief . Now a person who did not know M. Paul , who was unused to him and his impulses , would naturally have bungled at this offer - declined accepting the same - et cetera . But I too plainly felt this would never do : the slightest hesitation would have been fatal to the incipient treaty of peace . I rose and met the handkerchief half - way , received it with decorum , wiped therewith my eyes , and , resuming my seat , and retaining the flag of truce in my hand and on my lap , took especial care during the remainder of the lesson to touch neither needle nor thimble , scissors nor muslin . Many a jealous glance did M. Paul cast at these implements ; he hated them mortally , considering sewing a source of distraction from the attention due to himself . A very eloquent lesson he gave , and very kind and friendly was he to the close . Ere he had done , the clouds were dispersed and the sun shining out - tears were exchanged for smiles . In quitting the room he paused once more at my desk . "
115855	115865	115866	115866	I	0	" said he , this time not quite fiercely . "
115875	115876	115873	115873	Monsieur	1465	" "
115912	115937	115938	115938	You	2374	" The guess came so near the truth , I could not prevent a suddenly- rising warmth in my face from revealing as much . "
115945	115949	115940	115940	yourself	2374	" said he , "
115992	115993	115994	115994	Monsieur	1465	" "
115998	116014	115996	115996	Monsieur	2378	" I cried , or rather whispered after him , as he turned to go , "
116041	116042	116035	116035	I	0	" "
116061	116062	116059	116059	Mademoiselle	261	" "
116072	116073	116065	116065	Monsieur	1465	" "
116102	116286	116091	116091	I	0	" When he was gone , the pupils having already poured out of the schoolroom into the berceau , and thence into the garden and court to take their customary recreation before the five - o'clock dinner , I stood a moment thinking , and absently twisting the handkerchief round my arm . For some reason - gladdened , I think , by a sudden return of the golden glimmer of childhood , roused by an unwonted renewal of its buoyancy , made merry by the liberty of the closing hour , and , above all , solaced at heart by the joyous consciousness of that treasure in the case , box , drawer up - stairs , - I fell to playing with the handkerchief as if it were a ball , casting it into the air and catching it - as it fell . The game was stopped by another hand than mine - a hand emerging from a paletot - sleeve and stretched over my shoulder ; it caught the extemporised plaything and bore it away with these sullen words : "
116301	116447	116091	116091	I	0	" Really that little man was dreadful : a mere sprite of caprice and , ubiquity : one never knew either his whim or his whereabout . CHAPTER XXII . THE LETTER . When all was still in the house ; when dinner was over and the noisy recreation - hour past ; when darkness had set in , and the quiet lamp of study was lit in the refectory ; when the externes were gone home , the clashing door and clamorous bell hushed for the evening ; when Madame was safely settled in the salle - a - manger in company with her mother and some friends ; I then glided to the kitchen , begged a bougie for one half - hour for a particular occasion , found acceptance of my petition at the hands of my friend Goton , who answered , "
116464	116507	116091	116091	I	0	" and , light in hand , I mounted noiseless to the dormitory . Great was my chagrin to find in that apartment a pupil gone to bed indisposed , - greater when I recognised , amid the muslin nightcap borders , the "
116510	116575	116576	116576	Timon	318	" of Mistress Ginevra Fanshawe ; supine at this moment , it is true - but certain to wake and overwhelm me with chatter when the interruption would be least acceptable : indeed , as I watched her , a slight twinkling of the eyelids warned me that the present appearance of repose might be but a ruse , assumed to cover sly vigilance over "
116578	116809	116576	116576	Timon	318	" movements ; she was not to be trusted . And I had so wished to be alone , just to read my precious letter in peace . Well , I must go to the classes . Having sought and found my prize in its casket , I descended . Ill - luck pursued me . The classes were undergoing sweeping and purification by candle - light , according to hebdomadal custom : benches were piled on desks , the air was dim with dust , damp coffee - grounds used by Labassecourien housemaids instead of tea - leaves darkened the floor ; all was hopeless confusion . Baffled , but not beaten , I withdrew , bent as resolutely as ever on finding solitude somewhere . Taking a key whereof I knew the repository , I mounted three staircases in succession , reached a dark , narrow , silent landing , opened a worm- eaten door , and dived into the deep , black , cold garret . Here none would follow me - none interrupt - not Madame herself . I shut the garret - door ; I placed my light on a doddered and mouldy chest of drawers ; I put on a shawl , for the air was ice - cold ; I took my letter ; trembling with sweet impatience , I broke its seal . "
116820	116848	116576	116576	Timon	318	" thought I , passing my hand across my eyes to dissipate the silvery dimness of a suave , south - wind shower . It was long . "
116860	117481	116576	116576	Timon	318	" It was kind . To my checked , bridled , disciplined expectation , it seemed very kind : to my longing and famished thought it seemed , perhaps , kinder than it was . So little had I hoped , so much had I feared ; there was a fulness of delight in this taste of fruition - such , perhaps , as many a human being passes through life without ever knowing . The poor English teacher in the frosty garret , reading by a dim candle guttering in the wintry air , a letter simply good - natured - nothing more ; though that good - nature then seemed to me godlike - was happier than most queens in palaces . Of course , happiness of such shallow origin could be but brief ; yet , while it lasted it was genuine and exquisite : a bubble - but a sweet bubble - of real honey - dew . Dr. John had written to me at length ; he had written to me with pleasure ; he had written with benignant mood , dwelling with sunny satisfaction on scenes that had passed before his eyes and mine , - on places we had visited together - on conversations we had held - on all the little subject - matter , in short , of the last few halcyon weeks . But the cordial core of the delight was , a conviction the blithe , genial language generously imparted , that it had been poured out not merely to content me - but to gratify himself . A gratification he might never more desire , never more seek - an hypothesis in every point of view approaching the certain ; but that concerned the future . This present moment had no pain , no blot , no want ; full , pure , perfect , it deeply blessed me . A passing seraph seemed to have rested beside me , leaned towards my heart , and reposed on its throb a softening , cooling , healing , hallowing wing . Dr. John , you pained me afterwards : forgiven be every ill - freely forgiven - for the sake of that one dear remembered good ! Are there wicked things , not human , which envy human bliss ? Are there evil influences haunting the air , and poisoning it for man ? What was near me ? Something in that vast solitary garret sounded strangely . Most surely and certainly I heard , as it seemed , a stealthy foot on that floor : a sort of gliding out from the direction of the black recess haunted by the malefactor cloaks . I turned : my light was dim ; the room was long - but as I live ! I saw in the middle of that ghostly chamber a figure all black and white ; the skirts straight , narrow , black ; the head bandaged , veiled , white . Say what you will , reader - tell me I was nervous or mad ; affirm that I was unsettled by the excitement of that letter ; declare that I dreamed ; this I vow - I saw there - in that room - on that night - an image like - a NUN . I cried out ; I sickened . Had the shape approached me I might have swooned . It receded : I made for the door . How I descended all the stairs I know not . By instinct I shunned the refectory , and shaped my course to Madame 's sitting - room : I burst in . I said - "
117508	117512	117515	117515	you	2383	" I said , "
117517	117849	117515	117515	you	2383	" for the room seemed to me full of people , though in truth there were but four present : Madame Beck ; her mother , Madame Kint , who was out of health , and now staying with her on a visit ; her brother , M. Victor Kint , and another gentleman , who , when I entered the room , was conversing with the old lady , and had his back towards the door . My mortal fear and faintness must have made me deadly pale . I felt cold and shaking . They all rose in consternation ; they surrounded me . I urged them to go to the grenier ; the sight of the gentlemen did me good and gave me courage : it seemed as if there were some help and hope , with men at hand . I turned to the door , beckoning them to follow . They wanted to stop me , but I said they must come this way : they must see what I had seen - -something strange , standing in the middle of the garret . And , now , I remembered my letter , left on the drawers with the light . This precious letter ! Flesh or spirit must be defied for its sake . I flew up - stairs , hastening the faster as I knew I was followed : they were obliged to come . Lo ! when I reached the garret - door , all within was dark as a pit : the light was out . Happily some one - Madame , I think , with her usual calm sense - had brought a lamp from the room ; speedily , therefore , as they came up , a ray pierced the opaque blackness . There stood the bougie quenched on the drawers ; but where was the letter ? And I looked for that now , and not for the nun . "
117856	117956	117515	117515	you	2383	" I panted and plained , almost beside myself . I groped on the floor , wringing my hands wildly . Cruel , cruel doom ! To have my bit of comfort preternaturally snatched from me , ere I had well tasted its virtue ! I do n't know what the others were doing ; I could not watch them : they asked me questions I did not answer ; they ransacked all corners ; they prattled about this and that disarrangement of cloaks , a breach or crack in the sky - light - I know not what . "
117964	117969	117959	117959	somebody	4307	" was sagely averred . "

118000	118108	117993	117993	My	0	" asked a known voice in my ear . Could I believe that ear ? No : and I looked up . Could I trust my eyes ? Had I recognised the tone ? Did I now look on the face of the writer of that very letter ? Was this gentleman near me in this dim garret , John Graham - Dr. Bretton himself ? Yes : it was . He had been called in that very evening to prescribe for some access of illness in old Madame Kint ; he was the second gentleman present in the salle - a - manger when I entered . "

118241	118508	118509	118509	I	0	" A warm hand , taking my cold fingers , led me down to a room where there was a fire . Dr. John and I sat before the stove . He talked to me and soothed me with unutterable goodness , promising me twenty letters for the one lost . If there are words and wrongs like knives , whose deep- inflicted lacerations never heal - cutting injuries and insults of serrated and poison - dripping edge - so , too , there are consolations of tone too fine for the ear not fondly and for ever to retain their echo : caressing kindnesses - loved , lingered over through a whole life , recalled with unfaded tenderness , and answering the call with undimmed shine , out of that raven cloud foreshadowing Death himself . I have been told since that Dr. Bretton was not nearly so perfect as I thought him : that his actual character lacked the depth , height , compass , and endurance it possessed in my creed . I do n't know : he was as good to me as the well is to the parched wayfarer - as the sun to the shivering jailbird . I remember him heroic . Heroic at this moment will I hold him to be . He asked me , smiling , why I cared for his letter so very much . I thought , but did not say , that I prized it like the blood in my veins . I only answered that I had so few letters to care for . "
118518	118522	118512	118512	you	2392	" said he ; "

118604	118727	118586	118586	your	2392	" Curious , characteristic manoeuvre ! His quick eye had seen the letter on the floor where I sought it ; his hand , as quick , had snatched it up . He had hidden it in his waistcoat pocket . If my trouble had wrought with a whit less stress and reality , I doubt whether he would ever have acknowledged or restored it . Tears of temperature one degree cooler than those I shed would only have amused Dr. John . Pleasure at regaining made me forget merited reproach for the teasing torment ; my joy was great ; it could not be concealed : yet I think it broke out more in countenance than language . I said little . "
118733	118748	118729	118729	you	2392	" asked Dr. John . I replied that I was - satisfied and happy . "

118779	118806	118772	118772	you	2392	" It seemed to me , however , that I was sufficiently calm : at least I felt no longer terrified . I expressed myself composed . "

119244	119364	119237	119237	you	142	" To this provocative speech I made no answer . Graham in mirthful mood must not be humoured too far . Just now there was a new sort of smile playing about his lips - very sweet , but it grieved me somehow - a new sort of light sparkling in his eyes : not hostile , but not reassuring . I rose to go - I bid him good - night a little sadly . His sensitiveness - that peculiar , apprehensive , detective faculty of his - felt in a moment the unspoken complaint - the scarce - thought reproach . He asked quietly if I was offended . I shook my head as implying a negative . "

Won to confidence , I told him exactly what I had seen : ere now I had narrated to him the legend of the house - whiling away with that narrative an hour of a certain mild October afternoon , when be and I rode through Bois l'Etang . He sat and thought , and while he thought , we heard them all coming down - stairs . "
119731	119744	119726	119726	they	2411	" said he , glancing at the door with an annoyed expression . "
119751	119801	119745	119745	They	2411	" I answered ; for we were in the little salon where Madame never sat in the evening , and where it was by mere chance that heat was still lingering in the stove . They passed the door and went on to the salle - a - manger . "

119901	119925	119842	119842	She	2416	" I think it a case of spectral illusion : I fear , following on and resulting from long - continued mental conflict . "
119926	119959	119855	119855	You	2418	" Oh , Doctor John - I shudder at the thought of being liable to such an illusion ! It seemed so real . Is there no cure ? - no preventive ? "
119960	119975	119842	119842	She	2416	" Happiness is the cure - a cheerful mind the preventive : cultivate both . "

120456	120498	120453	120453	he	2427	" has led me through a phase of feeling which is over : I have entered another condition , and am now much disposed to exact love for love - passion for passion - and good measure of it , too . "
120499	120526	120528	120528	He	2427	" Ah , Doctor ! Doctor ! you said it was your nature to pursue Love under difficulties - to be charmed by a proud insensibility ! "

128915	128923	128875	128875	she	179	" My uncle de Bassompierre is come . "
128924	128943	128848	128848	she	179	" Your uncle de Bassompierre ! Are you not glad ? - I thought he was a favourite . "
128944	128958	128848	128848	she	179	" You thought wrong : the man is odious ; I hate him . "
128959	128975	128848	128848	she	179	" Because he is a foreigner ? or for what other reason of equal weight ? "
128976	129043	128875	128875	she	179	" He is not a foreigner . The man is English enough , goodness knows ; and had an English name till three or four years ago ; but his mother was a foreigner , a de Bassompierre , and some of her family are dead and have left him estates , a title , and this name : he is quite a great man now . "
129044	129053	128848	128848	she	179	" Do you hate him for that reason ? "
129054	129102	129103	129103	she	2640	" Do n't I know what mamma says about him ? He is not my own uncle , but married mamma 's sister . Mamma detests him ; she says he killed aunt Ginevra with unkindness : he looks like a bear . Such a dismal evening ! "
129107	129193	129103	129103	she	2640	" I 'll go no more to his big hotel . Fancy me walking into a room alone , and a great man fifty years old coming forwards , and after a few minutes ' conversation actually turning his back upon me , and then abruptly going out of the room . Such odd ways ! I daresay his conscience smote him , for they all say at home I am the picture of aunt Ginevra . Mamma often declares the likeness is quite ridiculous . "
129194	129201	128848	128848	she	179	" Were you the only visitor ? "
129202	129223	128848	128848	she	179	" The only visitor ? Yes ; then there was missy , my cousin : little spoiled , pampered thing . "
129224	129232	129103	129103	she	2640	" M. de Bassompierre has a daughter ? "
129233	129254	129255	129255	She	2641	" Yes , yes : do n't tease one with questions . Oh , dear ! I am so tired . "
129268	129288	129265	129265	she	2641	" It seems Mademoiselle was nearly crushed to a jelly in a hubbub at the theatre some weeks ago . "
129289	129306	129103	129103	she	2640	" Ah ! indeed . And they live at a large hotel in the Rue Crecy ? "
129307	129315	129103	129103	she	2640	" Justement . How do you know ? "
129316	129322	129103	129103	she	2640	" I have been there . "
129323	129428	129103	129103	she	2640	" Oh , you have ? Really ! You go everywhere in these days . I suppose Mother Bretton took you . She and Esculapius have the entree of the de Bassompierre apartments : it seems ' my son John ' attended missy on the occasion of her accident - Accident ? Bah ! All affectation ! I do n't think she was squeezed more than she richly deserves for her airs . And now there is quite an intimacy struck up : I heard something about ' auld lang syne , ' and what not . Oh , how stupid they all were ! "
129429	129440	129103	129103	she	2640	" All ! You said you were the only visitor . "
129441	129458	129103	129103	she	2640	" Did I ? You see one forgets to particularize an old woman and her boy . "
129459	129473	129103	129103	she	2640	" Dr. and Mrs. Bretton were at M. de Bassompierre 's this evening ? "
129474	129497	129103	129103	she	2640	" Ay , ay ! as large as life ; and missy played the hostess . What a conceited doll it is ! "
129551	129560	129561	129561	I	0	" Is Miss de Bassompierre quite well now ? "
129564	129625	129561	129561	I	0	" As well as you or I , no doubt ; but she is an affected little thing , and gave herself invalid airs to attract medical notice . And to see the old dowager making her recline on a couch , and ' my son John ' prohibiting excitement , etcetera - faugh ! the scene was quite sickening . "
129626	129652	129833	129833	her	2643	" It would not have been so if the object of attention had been changed : if you had taken Miss de Bassompierre 's place . "
129653	129664	129561	129561	I	0	" Indeed ! I hate ' my son John ! ' "
129665	129690	129561	129561	I	0	" ' My son John ! ' - whom do you indicate by that name ? Dr. Bretton 's mother never calls him so . "
129691	129704	129833	129833	her	2643	" Then she ought . A clownish , bearish John he is . "
129705	129743	129561	129561	I	0	" You violate the truth in saying so ; and as the whole of my patience is now spun off the distaff , I peremptorily desire you to rise from that bed , and vacate this room . "
129744	129788	129561	129561	I	0	" Passionate thing ! Your face is the colour of a coquelicot . I wonder what always makes you so mighty testy a l'endroit du gros Jean ? ' John Anderson , my Joe , John ! ' Oh , the distinguished name ! "
130391	130396	130386	130386	I	0	" This is cruel . "
130465	130469	130445	130445	I	0	" La Terrasse , "
130476	130709	130445	130445	I	0	" DEAR LUCY , - It occurs to me to inquire what you have been doing with yourself for the last month or two ? Not that I suspect you would have the least difficulty in giving an account of your proceedings . I daresay you have been just as busy and as happy as ourselves at La Terrasse . As to Graham , his professional connection extends daily : he is so much sought after , so much engaged , that I tell him he will grow quite conceited . Like a right good mother , as I am , I do my best to keep him down : no flattery does he get from me , as you know . And yet , Lucy , he is a fine fellow : his mother 's heart dances at the sight of him . After being hurried here and there the whole day , and passing the ordeal of fifty sorts of tempers , and combating a hundred caprices , and sometimes witnessing cruel sufferings - perhaps , occasionally , as I tell him , inflicting them - at night he still comes home to me in such kindly , pleasant mood , that really , I seem to live in a sort of moral antipodes , and on these January evenings my day rises when other people 's night sets in . "
130794	130915	130782	130784	an elderly simpleton	2661	" As for me , I have had my old Bretton agent here on a visit , and have been plunged overhead and ears in business matters . I do so wish to regain for Graham at least some part of what his father left him . He laughs to scorn my anxiety on this point , bidding me look and see how he can provide for himself and me too , and asking what the old lady can possibly want that she has not ; hinting about sky - blue turbans ; accusing me of an ambition to wear diamonds , keep livery servants , have an hotel , and lead the fashion amongst the English clan in Villette . "
131162	131185	131146	131148	a young bey	2668	" It was good entertainment ; but only half - enjoyed , since I was alone : you should have been there . "
131222	131304	131305	131306	LOUISA BRETTON	350	" But to come to the gist of my letter . I know Thursday is a half- holiday in the Rue Fossette : be ready , then , by five in the afternoon , at which hour I will send the carriage to take you out to La Terrasse . Be sure to come : you may meet some old acquaintance . Good - by , my wise , dear , grave little god - daughter . - Very truly yours , "
131308	132134	131305	131306	LOUISA BRETTON	350	" . Now , a letter like that sets one to rights ! I might still be sad after reading that letter , but I was more composed ; not exactly cheered , perhaps , but relieved . My friends , at least , were well and happy : no accident had occurred to Graham ; no illness had seized his mother- calamities that had so long been my dream and thought . Their feelings for me too were - as they had been . Yet , how strange it was to look on Mrs : Bretton 's seven weeks and contrast them with my seven weeks ! Also , how very wise it is in people placed in an exceptional position to hold their tongues and not rashly declare how such position galls them ! The world can understand well enough the process of perishing for want of food : perhaps few persons can enter into or follow out that of going mad from solitary confinement . They see the long - buried prisoner disinterred , a maniac or an idiot ! - how his senses left him - how his nerves , first inflamed , underwent nameless agony , and then sunk to palsy - is a subject too intricate for examination , too abstract for popular comprehension . Speak of it ! you might almost as well stand up in an European market - place , and propound dark sayings in that language and mood wherein Nebuchadnezzar , the imperial hypochondriac , communed with his baffled Chaldeans . And long , long may the minds to whom such themes are no mystery - by whom their bearings are sympathetically seized - be few in number , and rare of rencounter . Long may it be generally thought that physical privations alone merit compassion , and that the rest is a figment . When the world was younger and haler than now , moral trials were a deeper mystery still : perhaps in all the land of Israel there was but one Saul - certainly but one David to soothe or comprehend him . The keen , still cold of the morning was succeeded , later in the day , by a sharp breathing from Russian wastes : the cold zone sighed over the temperate zone , and froze it fast . A heavy firmament , dull , and thick with snow , sailed up from the north , and settled over expectant Europe . Towards afternoon began the descent . I feared no carriage would come , the white tempest raged so dense and wild . But trust my godmother ! Once having asked , she would have her guest . About six o'clock I was lifted from the carriage over the already blocked - up front steps of the chateau , and put in at the door of La Terrasse . Running through the vestibule , and up - stairs to the drawing - room , there I found Mrs. Bretton - a summer - day in her own person . Had I been twice as cold as I was , her kind kiss and cordial clasp would have warmed me . Inured now for so long a time to rooms with bare boards , black benches , desks , and stoves , the blue saloon seemed to me gorgeous . In its Christmas - like fire alone there was a clear and crimson splendour which quite dazzled me . When my godmother had held my hand for a little while , and chatted with me , and scolded me for having become thinner than when she last saw me , she professed to discover that the snow - wind had disordered my hair , and sent me up - stairs to make it neat and remove my shawl . Repairing to my own little sea - green room , there also I found a bright fire , and candles too were lit : a tall waxlight stood on each side the great looking glass ; but between the candles , and before the glass , appeared something dressing itself - an airy , fairy thing - small , slight , white - a winter spirit . I declare , for one moment I thought of Graham and his spectral illusions . With distrustful eye I noted the details of this new vision . It wore white , sprinkled slightly with drops of scarlet ; its girdle was red ; it had something in its hair leafy , yet shining - a little wreath with an evergreen gloss . Spectral or not , here truly was nothing frightful , and I advanced . Turning quick upon me , a large eye , under long lashes , flashed over me , the intruder : the lashes were as dark as long , and they softened with their pencilling the orb they guarded . "
132141	132192	132137	132137	you	2670	" she breathed out , in a soft , quiet voice , and she smiled slowly , and gazed intently . I knew her now . Having only once seen that sort of face , with that cast of fine and delicate featuring , I could not but know her . "
132197	132201	132137	132137	you	2670	" I pronounced . "
132204	132209	132211	132213	Miss de Bassompierre	348	" was the reply , "
132217	132233	132211	132213	Miss de Bassompierre	348	" I did not inquire who then she might be , but waited voluntary information . "
132244	132251	132252	132252	I	0	" she said , approaching nearer . "
132272	132318	132257	132257	your	2670	" I had moved to the fire , and she stood opposite , and gazed into me ; and as she gazed , her face became gradually more and more expressive of thought and feeling , till at last a dimness quenched her clear vision . "
132330	132334	132321	132321	me	0	" said she : "
132360	132380	132381	132381	I	0	" Interested , yet altogether at fault , I knew not what to say . At last I stammered , "
132401	132405	132406	132406	You	2670	" She smiled . "
132485	132493	132482	132483	Mr. Home	134	" At last I saw it all . "
132500	132501	132495	132495	you	0	" "
132510	132737	132504	132508	Paulina Mary Home de Bassompierre	141	" How time can change ! Little Polly wore in her pale , small features , her fairy symmetry , her varying expression , a certain promise of interest and grace ; but Paulina Mary was become beautiful - not with the beauty that strikes the eye like a rose - orbed , ruddy , and replete ; not with the plump , and pink , and flaxen attributes of her blond cousin Ginevra ; but her seventeen years had brought her a refined and tender charm which did not lie in complexion , though hers was fair and clear ; nor in outline , though her features were sweet , and her limbs perfectly turned ; but , I think , rather in a subdued glow from the soul outward . This was not an opaque vase , of material however costly , but a lamp chastely lucent , guarding from extinction , yet not hiding from worship , a flame vital and vestal . In speaking of her attractions , I would not exaggerate language ; but , indeed , they seemed to me very real and engaging . What though all was on a small scale , it was the perfume which gave this white violet distinction , and made it superior to the broadest camelia - the fullest dahlia that ever bloomed . "

132905	133073	132896	132896	I	0	" She looked as if she had . Her eyes were the eyes of one who can remember ; one whose childhood does not fade like a dream , nor whose youth vanish like a sunbeam . She would not take life , loosely and incoherently , in parts , and let one season slip as she entered on another : she would retain and add ; often review from the commencement , and so grow in harmony and consistency as she grew in years . Still I could not quite admit the conviction that all the pictures which now crowded upon me were vivid and visible to her . Her fond attachments , her sports and contests with a well - loved playmate , the patient , true devotion of her child 's heart , her fears , her delicate reserves , her little trials , the last piercing pain of separation .... I retraced these things , and shook my head incredulous . She persisted . "
133087	133091	132896	132896	I	0	" said she . "
133102	133118	133092	133092	You	2676	" I remarked , intending to test her . She set me right at once . "

133233	133238	133242	133242	her	130	" I went on . "

133595	133602	133591	133591	you	2685	" she questioned in her turn . "

Cheerful as my godmother naturally was , and entertaining as , for our sakes , she made a point of being , there was no true enjoyment that evening at La Terrasse , till , through the wild howl of the winter- night , were heard the signal sounds of arrival . How often , while women and girls sit warm at snug fire - sides , their hearts and imaginations are doomed to divorce from the comfort surrounding their persons , forced out by night to wander through dark ways , to dare stress of weather , to contend with the snow - blast , to wait at lonely gates and stiles in wildest storms , watching and listening to see and hear the father , the son , the husband coming home . Father and son came at last to the chateau : for the Count de Bassompierre that night accompanied Dr. Bretton . I know not which of our trio heard the horses first ; the asperity , the violence of the weather warranted our running down into the hall to meet and greet the two riders as they came in ; but they warned us to keep our distance : both were white - two mountains of snow ; and indeed Mrs. Bretton , seeing their condition , ordered them instantly to the kitchen ; prohibiting them , at their peril , from setting foot on her carpeted staircase till they had severally put off that mask of Old Christmas they now affected . Into the kitchen , however , we could not help following them : it was a large old Dutch kitchen , picturesque and pleasant . The little white Countess danced in a circle about her equally white sire , clapping her hands and crying , "
134250	134306	134240	134240	papa	4218	" The bear shook himself , and the little sprite fled far from the frozen shower . Back she came , however , laughing , and eager to aid in removing the arctic disguise . The Count , at last issuing from his dreadnought , threatened to overwhelm her with it as with an avalanche . "
134311	134424	134425	134426	Mrs. Bretton	130	" said she , bending to invite the fall , and when it was playfully advanced above her head , bounding out of reach like some little chamois . Her movements had the supple softness , the velvet grace of a kitten ; her laugh was clearer than the ring of silver and crystal ; as she took her sire 's cold hands and rubbed them , and stood on tiptoe to reach his lips for a kiss , there seemed to shine round her a halo of loving delight . The grave and reverend seignor looked down on her as men do look on what is the apple of their eye . "
134428	134432	134425	134426	Mrs. Bretton	130	" said he : "
134473	134474	134457	134457	you	0	" "
134489	134532	134475	134475	She	2695	" said Mrs. Bretton , who was in conflict with her son about some change of dress she deemed advisable , and which he resisted . He stood leaning against the Dutch dresser , laughing and keeping her at arm 's length . "
134537	134541	134535	134535	mamma	4272	" said he , "
134578	134660	134475	134475	She	2695	" So , while the Count stood by the fire , and Paulina Mary still danced to and fro - happy in the liberty of the wide hall - like kitchen - Mrs. Bretton herself instructed Martha to spice and heat the wassail - bowl , and , pouring the draught into a Bretton flagon , it was served round , reaming hot , by means of a small silver vessel , which I recognised as Graham 's christening - cup . "
134668	134688	134689	134689	We	2700	" said the Count ; holding the glancing cup on high . Then , looking at Mrs. Bretton . - "
134718	134750	134689	134689	We	2700	" And surely ye'll be your pint - stoup , And surely I 'll be mine ; And we 'll taste a cup o ' kindness yet For auld lang syne . "

134760	134784	134758	134758	Paulina	141	" papa is talking Scotch ; and Scotch he is , partly . We are Home and de Bassompierre , Caledonian and Gallic . "
134785	134800	134802	134803	her father	643	" And is that a Scotch reel you are dancing , you Highland fairy ? "
134805	134842	134802	134803	her father	643	" Mrs. Bretton , there will be a green ring growing up in the middle of your kitchen shortly . I would not answer for her being quite cannie : she is a strange little mortal . "
134843	134858	134859	134860	Mr. Home	134	" Tell Lucy to dance with me , papa ; there is Lucy Snowe . "
134889	134937	134880	134880	his	353	" he remembered me well ; and , even had his own memory been less trustworthy , my name was so often on his daughter 's lips , and he had listened to so many long tales about me , I should seem like an old acquaintance . "
134985	134990	134992	134992	she	141	" Let me taste , "

135156	135170	135117	135117	his	135	" I think I said so . I think I intimated as much . "
135171	135195	135117	135117	his	135	" Could n't consent to a step of the kind on any account . Sorry for it , but could n't do it . "
135196	135224	135117	135117	his	135	" Why ? I am quite well now : it ca n't break my collar - bone again , or dislocate my shoulder . Is it wine ? "

135232	135250	135117	135117	his	135	" I do n't want dew ; I do n't like dew : but what is it ? "
135251	135269	135117	135117	his	135	" Ale - strong ale - old October ; brewed , perhaps , when I was born . "
135270	135280	135117	135117	his	135	" It must be curious : is it good ? "
135281	135285	135117	135117	his	135	" Excessively good . "
135323	135330	135332	135332	Paulina	141	" I should like a little , "
135337	135351	135332	135332	Paulina	141	" I never had any ' old October : ' is it sweet ? "
135352	135356	135358	135358	Graham	135	" Perilously sweet , "
135458	135467	135469	135469	she	141	" A little more - a little more , "
135490	135517	135518	135518	He	135	" It smells of spice and sugar , but I ca n't taste it ; your wrist is so stiff , and you are so stingy . "
135529	135543	135518	135518	He	135	" Do n't tell my mother or Lucy ; they would n't approve . "
135544	135549	135551	135551	she	141	" Nor do I , "
135589	135624	135641	135641	she	141	" I find it anything but sweet ; it is bitter and hot , and takes away my breath . Your old October was only desirable while forbidden . Thank you , no more . "
135781	135810	135812	135812	she	141	" And where were you at such a time , papa ? And what did you say then ? And tell Mrs. Bretton what happened on that occasion . "
136037	136044	136046	136046	she	2721	" Papa shall not go out , "
136061	136080	136046	136046	she	2721	" I will look after him . You wo n't go into town , will you , papa ? "
136081	136087	136031	136032	The Countess	2721	" Ay , and No , "
136092	136172	136031	136032	The Countess	2721	" If you and Mrs. Bretton are very good to me , Polly - kind , you know , and attentive ; if you pet me in a very nice manner , and make much of me , I may possibly be induced to wait an hour after breakfast and see whether this razor - edged wind settles . But , you see , you give me no breakfast ; you offer me nothing : you let me starve . "
136173	136187	136189	136189	Paulina	141	" Quick ! please , Mrs. Bretton , and pour out the coffee , "
136191	136219	136220	136220	She	141	" whilst I take care of the Count de Bassompierre in other respects : since he grew into a Count , he has needed so much attention . "
136227	136239	136241	136241	she	141	" There , papa , are your ' pistolets ' charged , "
136243	136279	136241	136241	she	141	" And there is some marmalade , just the same sort of marmalade we used to have at Bretton , and which you said was as good as if it had been conserved in Scotland - "
136280	136298	136300	136301	Mrs. Bretton	130	" And which your little ladyship used to beg for my boy - do you remember that ? "
136303	136342	136300	136301	Mrs. Bretton	130	" Have you forgotten how you would come to my elbow and touch my sleeve with the whisper , ' Please , ma'am , something good for Graham - a little marmalade , or honey , or jam ? "
136344	136349	136352	136353	Dr. John	135	" No , mamma , "
136360	136376	136352	136353	Dr. John	135	" it surely was not so : I could not have cared for these things . "
136377	136387	136241	136241	she	141	" Did he or did he not , Paulina ? "
136388	136393	136395	136395	Paulina	141	" He liked them , "
136397	136405	136407	136408	Mr. Home	134	" Never blush for it , John , "
136412	136470	136407	136408	Mr. Home	134	" I like them myself yet , and always did . And Polly showed her sense in catering for a friend 's material comforts : it was I who put her into the way of such good manners - nor do I let her forget them . Polly , offer me a small slice of that tongue . "
136471	136503	136241	136241	she	141	" There , papa : but remember you are only waited upon with this assiduity ; on condition of being persuadable , and reconciling yourself to La Terrasse for the day . "
136504	136508	136510	136511	the Count	6347	" Mrs. Bretton , "
136513	136537	136510	136511	the Count	6347	" I want to get rid of my daughter - to send her to school . Do you know of any good school ? "
136538	136549	136241	136241	she	141	" There is Lucy 's place - Madame Beck 's . "
136550	136558	136241	136241	she	141	" Miss Snowe is in a school ? "
136559	136565	136566	136566	I	0	" I am a teacher , "
136935	136938	136940	136940	he	134	" Yours , "
136942	136961	136940	136940	he	134	" is an arduous calling . I wish you health and strength to win in it - success . "
136991	136997	136999	136999	she	2739	" Are you a teacher ? "
137010	137035	136975	136975	she	2739	" Well , I never knew what you were , nor ever thought of asking : for me , you were always Lucy Snowe . "
137036	137043	137044	137044	I	0	" And what am I now ? "
137050	137066	137044	137044	I	0	" Yourself , of course . But do you really teach here , in Villette ? "
137067	137072	137114	137114	he	643	" I really do . "
137073	137080	137114	137114	he	643	" And do you like it ? "
137081	137085	137044	137044	I	0	" Not always . "
137086	137096	137114	137114	he	643	" And why do you go on with it ? "
137118	137199	137114	137114	he	643	" Proceed , Polly , proceed with that catechism - prove yourself the little wiseacre you are . If Miss Snowe were to blush and look confused , I should have to bid you hold your tongue ; and you and I would sit out the present meal in some disgrace ; but she only smiles , so push her hard , multiply the cross - questions . Well , Miss Snowe , why do you go on with it ? "
137200	137215	137044	137044	I	0	" Chiefly , I fear , for the sake of the money I get . "
137216	137244	137044	137044	I	0	" Not then from motives of pure philanthropy ? Polly and I were clinging to that hypothesis as the most lenient way of accounting for your eccentricity . "
137245	137299	137114	137114	he	643	" No - no , sir . Rather for the roof of shelter I am thus enabled to keep over my head ; and for the comfort of mind it gives me to think that while I can work for myself , I am spared the pain of being a burden to anybody . "
137300	137312	137044	137044	I	0	" Papa , say what you will , I pity Lucy . "
137313	137408	137044	137044	I	0	" Take up that pity , Miss de Bassompierre ; take it up in both hands , as you might a little callow gosling squattering out of bounds without leave ; put it back in the warm nest of a heart whence it issued , and receive in your ear this whisper . If my Polly ever came to know by experience the uncertain nature of this world 's goods , I should like her to act as Lucy acts : to work for herself , that she might burden neither kith nor kin . "
137409	137414	137416	137416	she	2741	" Yes , papa , "
137422	137440	137416	137416	she	2741	" But poor Lucy ! I thought she was a rich lady , and had rich friends . "
137441	137529	137530	137530	he	2742	" You thought like a little simpleton . I never thought so . When I had time to consider Lucy 's manner and aspect , which was not often , I saw she was one who had to guard and not be guarded ; to act and not be served : and this lot has , I imagine , helped her to an experience for which , if she live long enough to realize its full benefit , she may yet bless Providence . But this school , "
137541	137556	137557	137557	I	0	" would Madame Beck admit my Polly , do you think , Miss Lucy ? "
137580	137586	137587	137587	I	0	" If you , sir , "
137590	137651	137587	137587	I	0	" will but take Miss de Bassompierre in your carriage this very afternoon , I think I can answer for it that Rosine , the portress , will not be very slow in answering your ring ; and Madame , I am sure , will put on her best pair of gloves to come into the salon to receive you . "
137652	137657	137659	137660	Mr. Home	134	" In that case , "
137662	137750	137659	137660	Mr. Home	134	" I see no sort of necessity there is for delay . Mrs. Hurst can send what she calls her young lady 's ' things ' after her ; Polly can settle down to her horn - book before night ; and you , Miss Lucy , I trust , will not disdain to cast an occasional eye upon her , and let me know , from time to time , how she gets on . I hope you approve of the arrangement , Countess de Bassompierre ? "
137757	137761	137763	137763	she	2721	" I thought , "
137765	137774	137763	137763	she	2721	" I thought I had finished my education - "
137775	137864	137587	137587	I	0	" That only proves how much we may be mistaken in our thoughts I hold a far different opinion , as most of these will who have been auditors of your profound knowledge of life this morning . Ah , my little girl , thou hast much to learn ; and papa ought to have taught thee more than he has done ! Come , there is nothing for it but to try Madame Beck ; and the weather seems settling , and I have finished my breakfast - "
137865	137870	137763	137763	she	2721	" But , papa ! "
137871	137874	137763	137763	she	2721	" Well ? "
137875	137881	137587	137587	I	0	" I see an obstacle . "
137882	137889	137763	137763	she	2721	" I do n't at all . "
137890	137921	137763	137763	she	2721	" It is enormous , papa ; it can never be got over ; it is as large as you in your greatcoat , and the snowdrift on the top . "
137922	137933	137587	137587	I	0	" And , like that snowdrift , capable of melting ? "
137934	138171	137763	137763	she	2721	" No ! it is of too - too solid flesh : it is just your own self . Miss Lucy , warn Madame Beck not to listen to any overtures about taking me , because , in the end , it would turn out that she would have to take papa too : as he is so teasing , I will just tell tales about him . Mrs. Bretton and all of you listen : About five years ago , when I was twelve years old , he took it into his head that he was spoiling me ; that I was growing unfitted for the world , and I do n't know what , and nothing would serve or satisfy him , but I must go to school . I cried , and so on ; but M. de Bassompierre proved hard - hearted , quite firm and flinty , and to school I went . What was the result ? In the most admirable manner , papa came to school likewise : every other day he called to see me . Madame Aigredoux grumbled , but it was of no use ; and so , at last , papa and I were both , in a manner , expelled . Lucy can just tell Madame Beck this little trait : it is only fair to let her know what she has to expect . "
139265	139272	139255	139255	she	141	" This will not hold long , "
139701	139712	139688	139688	She	141	" Papa ! papa ! you are not going out ? "
139713	139723	139692	139692	she	141	" My pet , I must go into town . "
139724	139735	139688	139688	She	141	" But it is too - too cold , papa . "
139787	139824	139779	139779	she	141	" But you will promise to come back here this evening , before it is quite dark ; - you and Dr. Bretton , both , in the carriage ? It is not fit to ride . "
139825	139861	139740	139742	M. de Bassompierre	178	" Well , if I see the Doctor , I will tell him a lady has laid on him her commands to take care of his precious health and come home early under my escort . "
139862	139899	139779	139779	she	141	" Yes , you must say a lady ; and he will think it is his mother , and be obedient And , papa , mind to come soon , for I shall watch and listen . "
140621	140692	140693	140693	She	190	" Oui , oui , ma bonne amie : je vous donne la permission de coeur et de gre . Votre travail dans ma maison a toujours ete admirable , rempli de zele et de discretion : vous avez bien le droit de vous amuser . Sortez donc tant que vous voudrez . Quant a votre choix de connaissances , j'en suis contente ; c'est sage , digne , laudable . "
140752	140755	140757	140757	I	0	" Patience ! "
140761	140777	140757	140757	I	0	" Let me say nothing , but wait peaceably ; they will come back again . "
141058	141063	141065	141065	she	190	" Il y a , "
141067	141077	141065	141065	she	190	" quelquechose de bien remarquable dans le caractere Anglais . "
141078	141083	141084	141084	She	190	" How , Madame ? "
141093	141095	141084	141084	She	190	" how "
141099	141141	141142	141142	she	190	" Je ne saurais vous dire ' how ; ' mais , enfin , les Anglais ont des idees a eux , en amitie , en amour , en tout . Mais au moins il n'est pas besoin de les surveiller , "
141158	141163	141142	141142	she	190	" Then I hope , "
141169	141181	141142	141142	she	190	" you will graciously let alone my letters for the future . "
141376	141411	141371	141371	I	0	" The Hope I am bemoaning suffered and made me suffer much : it did not die till it was full time : following an agony so lingering , death ought to be welcome . "

143339	143358	143333	143333	her	141	" Come down . Why do you sit here by yourself ? You must come into the parlour . "
143368	143374	143375	143375	she	141	" Leave the Rue Fossette , "
143378	143398	143375	143375	she	141	" and come and live with us . Papa would give you far more than Madame Beck gives you . "

143830	143877	143828	143828	she	190	" if I attempt to make it advantageous to you , there will arise misunderstanding between us - perhaps separation . One thing , however , I can do to please you - leave you alone with your liberty : c'est - ce que je ferai . "

144185	144193	144181	144181	she	141	" Papa , I am grown up . "
144324	144329	144330	144330	he	643	" My little Polly , "
144334	144396	144330	144330	he	643	" you live too retired a life ; if you grow to be a woman with these shy manners , you will hardly be fitted for society . You really make quite a stranger of Dr. Bretton : how is this ? Do n't you remember that , as a little girl , you used to be rather partial to him ? "
144397	144402	144404	144404	she	141	" Rather , papa , "
144417	144431	144407	144407	her	141	" And you do n't like him now ? What has he done ? "
144432	144456	144330	144330	he	643	" Nothing . Y - e - s , I like him a little ; but we are grown strange to each other . "
144457	144487	144330	144330	he	643	" Then rub it off , Polly ; rub the rust and the strangeness off . Talk away when he is here , and have no fear of him ? "
144488	144507	144407	144407	her	141	" He does not talk much . Is he afraid of me , do you think , papa ? "
144508	144528	144330	144330	he	643	" Oh , to be sure , what man would not be afraid of such a little silent lady ? "
144529	144557	144330	144330	he	643	" Then tell him some day not to mind my being silent . Say that it is my way , and that I have no unfriendly intention . "
144558	144581	144407	144407	her	141	" Your way , you little chatter - box ? So far from being your way , it is only your whim ! "
144582	144591	144330	144330	he	643	" Well , I 'll improve , papa . "
144719	144733	144712	144712	she	2902	" Did I keep my word , papa ? Did I behave better ? "
144734	144837	145115	145117	M. de Bassompierre	178	" My Polly behaved like a queen . I shall become quite proud of her if this improvement continues . By - and - by we shall see her receiving my guests with quite a calm , grand manner . Miss Lucy and I will have to look about us , and polish up all our best airs and graces lest we should be thrown into the shade . Still , Polly , there is a little flutter , a little tendency to stammer now and then , and even , to lisp as you lisped when you were six years old . "
144838	144843	144845	144845	she	2906	" No , papa , "
144848	144855	144845	144845	she	2906	" that ca n't be true . "
144856	144904	145115	145117	M. de Bassompierre	178	" I appeal to Miss Lucy . Did she not , in answering Dr. Bretton 's question as to whether she had ever seen the palace of the Prince of Bois l'Etang , say , ' yeth , ' she had been there ' theveral ' times ? "
144905	144954	145115	145117	M. de Bassompierre	178	" Papa , you are satirical , you are mechant ! I can pronounce all the letters of the alphabet as clearly as you can . But tell me this you are very particular in making me be civil to Dr. Bretton , do you like him yourself ? "
144955	145000	144845	144845	she	2906	" To be sure : for old acquaintance sake I like him : then he is a very good son to his mother ; besides being a kind - hearted fellow and clever in his profession : yes , the callant is well enough . "
145001	145021	145115	145117	M. de Bassompierre	178	" Callant ! Ah , Scotchman ! Papa , is it the Edinburgh or the Aberdeen accent you have ? "
145022	145061	145115	145117	M. de Bassompierre	178	" Both , my pet , both : and doubtless the Glaswegian into the bargain . It is that which enables me to speak French so well : a gude Scots tongue always succeeds well at the French . "
145062	145079	144845	144845	she	2906	" The French ! Scotch again : incorrigible papa . You , too , need schooling . "
145080	145110	145115	145117	M. de Bassompierre	178	" Well , Polly , you must persuade Miss Snowe to undertake both you and me ; to make you steady and womanly , and me refined and classical . "
145120	145124	144845	144845	she	2906	" Miss Snowe , "
145531	145653	145654	145654	I	0	" had his eye on me : he at least would discharge the duty of a friend , and not leave me entirely to my own devices . My , proceedings seemed at present very unsettled : he did not know what to make of them : he thought his cousin Beck very much to blame in suffering this sort of fluttering inconsistency in a teacher attached to her house . What had a person devoted to a serious calling , that of education , to do with Counts and Countesses , hotels and chateaux ? To him , I seemed altogether ' en l'air .

146527	146602	146525	146525	she	141	" is that the summit of earthly happiness , the end of life - to love ? I do n't think it is . It may be the extreme of mortal misery , it may be sheer waste of time , and fruitless torture of feeling . If Schiller had said to be loved , he might have come nearer the truth . Is not that another thing , Lucy , to be loved ? "
146603	146629	146630	146630	She	141	" I suppose it may be : but why consider the subject ? What is love to you ? What do you know about it ? "

146650	146700	146647	146647	she	141	" I wo n't take that from you . It may be well for papa to look on me as a baby : I rather prefer that he should thus view me ; but you know and shall learn to acknowledge that I am verging on my nineteenth year . "
146701	146729	146814	146814	she	141	" No matter if it were your twenty - ninth ; we will anticipate no feelings by discussion and conversation ; we will not talk about love . "
146730	146735	146737	146737	she	141	" Indeed , indeed ! "
146745	146796	146737	146737	she	141	" you may think to check and hold me in , as much as you please ; but I have talked about it , and heard about it too ; and a great deal and lately , and disagreeably and detrimentally : and in a way you would n't approve . "
146853	146878	146847	146847	I	0	" Who talks to you disagreeably and detrimentally on such matters ? Who that has near access to you would dare to do it ? "

146888	146913	146884	146884	she	141	" it is a person who makes me miserable sometimes ; and I wish she would keep away - I do n't want her . "

146930	146982	146884	146884	she	141	" It is - it is my cousin Ginevra . Every time she has leave to visit Mrs. Cholmondeley she calls here , and whenever she finds me alone she begins to talk about her admirers . Love , indeed ! You should hear all she has to say about love . "
146983	146991	146993	146993	I	0	" Oh , I have heard it , "
146998	147051	146993	146993	I	0	" and on the whole , perhaps it is as well you should have heard it too : it is not to be regretted , it is all right . Yet , surely , Ginevra 's mind can not influence yours . You can look over both her head and her heart . "
147052	147085	146884	146884	she	141	" She does influence me very much . She has the art of disturbing my happiness and unsettling my opinions . She hurts me through the feelings and people dearest to me . "
147086	147108	146884	146884	she	141	" What does she say , Paulina ? Give me some idea . There may be counteraction of the damage done . "

147168	147253	146884	146884	she	141	" Lucy , she is insolent ; and , I believe , false . You know Dr. Bretton . We both know him . He may be careless and proud ; but when was he ever mean or slavish ? Day after day she shows him to me kneeling at her feet , pursuing her like her shadow . She - repulsing him with insult , and he imploring her with infatuation . Lucy , is it true ? Is any of it true ? "

147294	147314	146884	146884	she	141	" It is these tales which have caused that reserve in your manner towards Graham which your father noticed . "
147315	147359	146993	146993	I	0	" They have certainly made me all doubtful about his character . As Ginevra speaks , they do not carry with them the sound of unmixed truth : I believe she exaggerates - perhaps invents - but I want to know how far . "
147360	147381	146884	146884	she	141	" Suppose we bring Miss Fanshawe to some proof . Give her an opportunity of displaying the power she boasts . "
147382	147502	146884	146884	she	141	" I could do that to - morrow . Papa has asked some gentlemen to dinner , all savants . Graham , who , papa is beginning to discover , is a savant , too - skilled , they say , in more than one branch of science - is among the number . Now I should be miserable to sit at table unsupported , amidst such a party . I could not talk to Messieurs A - - and Z - - , the Parisian Academicians : all my new credit for manner would be put in peril . You and Mrs. Bretton must come for my sake ; Ginevra , at a word , will join you . "

147880	147907	147878	147878	I	0	" I had not much respect for the connections you chiefly frequented awhile ago : Mrs. Cholmondeley and Co. would never have suited me at all . "

148276	148304	148273	148273	she	2961	" I thought , by offering to take your arm , to intimate approbation of your dress and general appearance : I meant it as a compliment . "
148305	148372	148385	148385	her	2961	" You did ? You meant , in short , to express that you are not ashamed to be seen in the street with me ? That if Mrs. Cholmondeley should be fondling her lapdog at some window , or Colonel de Hamal picking his teeth in a balcony , and should catch a glimpse of us , you would not quite blush for your companion ? "

Of course , you can not but render homage to the merits of Miss Fanshawe : now , what do you think of others in the room ? - my mother , for instance ; or the lions yonder , Messieurs A - - and Z - - ; or , let us say , that pale little lady , Miss de Bassompierre ?

152187	152218	152017	152017	I	0	" I think she is , as you say , a pale little lady - pale , certainly , just now , when she is fatigued with over - excitement . "

152241	152286	152017	152017	I	0	" I had forgotten her ; but it is noticeable , that circumstances , persons , even words and looks , that had slipped your memory , may , under certain conditions , certain aspects of your own or another 's mind , revive . "

152301	152374	152298	152298	he	3090	" the revival is imperfect - needs confirmation , partakes so much of the dim character of a dream , or of the airy one of a fancy , that the testimony of a witness becomes necessary for corroboration . Were you not a guest at Bretton ten years ago , when Mr. Home brought his little girl , whom we then called ' little Polly , ' to stay with mamma ? "

154497	154519	154489	154489	I	0	" Then it was my words which wounded you ? Consider them unsaid : permit my retractation ; accord my pardon . "
154520	154528	154456	154456	he	196	" I am not angry , Monsieur . "
154529	154545	154456	154456	he	196	" Then you are worse than angry - grieved . Forgive me , Miss Lucy . "
154546	154555	154489	154489	I	0	" M. Emanuel , I do forgive you . "
154556	154586	154587	154587	He	3109	" Let me hear you say , in the voice natural to you , and not in that alien tone , ' Mon ami , je vous pardonne . ' "
154606	154609	154610	154610	he	3109	" Bon ! "
154613	154627	154610	154610	he	3109	" Voila que le jour va poindre ! Dites donc , mon ami . "
154628	154636	154587	154587	He	3109	" Monsieur Paul , je vous pardonne . "
154637	154672	154610	154610	he	3109	" I will have no monsieur : speak the other word , or I shall not believe you sincere : another effort - mon ami , or else in English , - my friend ! "
154675	154678	154587	154587	He	3109	" my friend "
154686	154690	154587	154587	He	3109	" mon ami ; "
154704	154707	154708	154708	I	0	" mon ami "
154716	154720	154721	154721	I	0	" my friend , "
155334	155634	155323	155323	herself	190	" through , retrenching her skirts , and carefully coasting the formidable estrade , like a ship dreading breakers . As to Rosine , the portress - on whom , every half - hour , devolved the fearful duty of fetching pupils out of the very heart of one or other of the divisions to take their music - lessons in the oratory , the great or little saloon , the salle - a- manger , or some other piano - station - she would , upon her second or third attempt , frequently become almost tongue - tied from excess of consternation - a sentiment inspired by the unspeakable looks levelled at her through a pair of dart - dealing spectacles . One morning I was sitting in the carre , at work upon a piece of embroidery which one of the pupils had commenced but delayed to finish , and while my fingers wrought at the frame , my ears regaled themselves with listening to the crescendos and cadences of a voice haranguing in the neighbouring classe , in tones that waxed momentarily more unquiet , more ominously varied . There was a good strong partition - wall between me and the gathering storm , as well as a facile means of flight through the glass - door to the court , in case it swept this way ; so I am afraid I derived more amusement than alarm from these thickening symptoms . Poor Rosine was not safe : four times that blessed morning had she made the passage of peril ; and now , for the fifth time , it became her dangerous duty to snatch , as it were , a brand from the burning - a pupil from under M. Paul 's nose . "
155641	155645	155323	155323	herself	190	" cried she . "
155667	155680	155742	155746	Madame Beck elle - meme	190	" Nerved by the courage of desperation , she opened the door . "
155687	155712	155742	155746	Madame Beck elle - meme	190	" was her cry . Ere she could make good her retreat , or quite close the door , this voice uttered itself : - "
155748	155772	155773	155773	Mademoiselle	383	" Ten minutes had not succeeded the promulgation of this decree when Rosine 's French pantoufles were again heard shuffling along the corridor . "
155775	155779	155773	155773	Mademoiselle	383	" said she , "
155839	155840	155829	155829	she	190	" "
155878	155879	155880	155880	I	0	" "
155913	155914	155896	155896	Madame	190	" "
155928	155929	155896	155896	Madame	190	" "
155983	156412	155978	155978	he	3132	" Yes , I knew well enough . The restive little man detested spur or curb : against whatever was urgent or obligatory , he was sure to revolt . However , I accepted the responsibility - not , certainly , without fear , but fear blent with other sentiments , curiosity , amongst them . I opened the door , I entered , I closed it behind me as quickly and quietly as a rather unsteady hand would permit ; for to be slow or bustling , to rattle a latch , or leave a door gaping wide , were aggravations of crime often more disastrous in result than the main crime itself . There I stood then , and there he sat ; his humour was visibly bad - almost at its worst ; he had been giving a lesson in arithmetic - for he gave lessons on any and every subject that struck his fancy - and arithmetic being a dry subject , invariably disagreed with him : not a pupil but trembled when he spoke of figures . He sat , bent above his desk : to look up at the sound of an entrance , at the occurrence of a direct breach of his will and law , was an effort he could not for the moment bring himself to make . It was quite as well : I thus gained time to walk up the long classe ; and it suited my idiosyncracy far better to encounter the near burst of anger like his , than to bear its menace at a distance . At his estrade I paused , just in front ; of course I was not worthy of immediate attention : he proceeded with his lesson . Disdain would not do : he must hear and he must answer my message . Not being quite tall enough to lift my head over his desk , elevated upon the estrade , and thus suffering eclipse in my present position , I ventured to peep round , with the design , at first , of merely getting a better view of his face , which had struck me when I entered as bearing a close and picturesque resemblance to that of a black and sallow tiger . Twice did I enjoy this side - view with impunity , advancing and receding unseen ; the third time my eye had scarce dawned beyond the obscuration of the desk , when it was caught and transfixed through its very pupil - transfixed by the "
156415	156455	155978	155978	he	3132	" Rosine was right ; these utensils had in them a blank and immutable terror , beyond the mobile wrath of the wearer 's own unglazed eyes . I now found the advantage of proximity : these short - sighted "
156457	156600	156602	156602	me	0	" were useless for the inspection of a criminal under Monsieur 's nose ; accordingly , he doffed them , and he and I stood on more equal terms . I am glad I was not really much afraid of him - that , indeed , close in his presence , I felt no terror at all ; for upon his demanding cord and gibbet to execute the sentence recently pronounced , I was able to furnish him with a needleful of embroidering thread with such accommodating civility as could not but allay some portion at least of his surplus irritation . Of course I did not parade this courtesy before public view : I merely handed the thread round the angle of the desk , and attached it , ready noosed , to the barred back of the Professor 's chair . "
156607	156656	156657	156657	Monsieur	3136	" said he in a growl of which the music was wholly confined to his chest and throat , for he kept his teeth clenched ; and seemed registering to himself an inward vow that nothing earthly should wring from him a smile . My answer commenced uncompromisingly : "
156659	156663	156657	156657	Monsieur	3136	" I said , "
156672	156686	156657	156657	Monsieur	3136	" and thinking it best not to mince matters , but to administer the "
156688	156722	156723	156723	He	3136	" with decision , in a low but quick voice , I delivered the Athenian message , floridly exaggerating its urgency . Of course , he would not hear a word of it . "
156769	156826	156746	156746	He	3136	" I knew , however , that he must go ; that , talk as he would , both his duty and interest commanded an immediate and literal compliance with the summons : I stood , therefore , waiting in silence , as if he had not yet spoken . He asked what more I wanted . "
156837	156886	156746	156746	He	3136	" He waved an impatient negative . I ventured to stretch my hand to the bonnet - grec which lay in grim repose on the window - sill . He followed this daring movement with his eye , no doubt in mixed pity and amazement at its presumption . "
156889	156893	156746	156746	He	3136	" he muttered , "
156934	156958	156910	156910	she	142	" With great respect , I laid the bonnet on the desk , where its tassel seemed to give me an awful nod . "
156971	157019	156910	156910	she	142	" said he , still bent on evasion . Knowing well it would not do , I gently pushed the bonnet towards his hand . Thus impelled , it slid down the polished slope of the varnished and unbaized desk , carried before it the light steel- framed "
157022	157096	156910	156910	she	142	" and , fearful to relate , they fell to the estrade . A score of times ere now had I seen them fall and receive no damage - this time , as Lucy Snowe 's hapless luck would have it , they so fell that each clear pebble became a shivered and shapeless star . Now , indeed , dismay seized me - dismay and regret . I knew the value of these "
157098	157187	157230	157230	traitress	3144	" : M. Paul 's sight was peculiar , not easily fitted , and these glasses suited him . I had heard him call them his treasures : as I picked them up , cracked and worthless , my hand trembled . Frightened through all my nerves I was to see the mischief I had done , but I think I was even more sorry than afraid . For some seconds I dared not look the bereaved Professor in the face ; he was the first to speak . "
157190	157194	157230	157230	traitress	3144	" said he : "
157246	157380	157232	157232	You	3144	" I lifted my eyes : his face , instead of being irate , lowering , and furrowed , was overflowing with the smile , coloured with the bloom I had seen brightening it that evening at the Hotel Crecy . He was not angry - not even grieved . For the real injury he showed himself full of clemency ; under the real provocation , patient as a saint . This event , which seemed so untoward - which I thought had ruined at once my chance of successful persuasion - proved my best help . Difficult of management so long as I had done him no harm , he became graciously pliant as soon as I stood in his presence a conscious and contrite offender . Still gently railing at me as "
157394	157421	157228	157228	traitress	3144	" - he declared that he dared not but obey one who had given such an instance of her dangerous prowess ; it was absolutely like the "
157431	157449	157228	157228	traitress	3144	" So , at last , crowning himself with his bonnet - grec , and taking his ruined "
157451	157602	157230	157230	traitress	3144	" from my hand with a clasp of kind pardon and encouragement , he made his bow , and went off to the Athenee in first - rate humour and spirits . After all this amiability , the reader will be sorry for my sake to hear that I was quarrelling with M. Paul again before night ; yet so it was , and I could not help it . It was his occasional custom - and a very laudable , acceptable custom , too - to arrive of an evening , always a l'improviste , unannounced , burst in on the silent hour of study , establish a sudden despotism over us and our occupations , cause books to be put away , work - bags to be brought out , and , drawing forth a single thick volume , or a handful of pamphlets , substitute for the besotted "
157606	157759	157230	157230	traitress	3144	" drawled by a sleepy pupil , some tragedy made grand by grand reading , ardent by fiery action - some drama , whereof , for my part , I rarely studied the intrinsic merit ; for M. Emanuel made it a vessel for an outpouring , and filled it with his native verve and passion like a cup with a vital brewage . Or else he would flash through our conventual darkness a reflex of a brighter world , show us a glimpse of the current literature of the day , read us passages from some enchanting tale , or the last witty feuilleton which had awakened laughter in the saloons of Paris ; taking care always to expunge , with the severest hand , whether from tragedy , melodrama , tale , or essay , whatever passage , phrase , or word , could be deemed unsuited to an audience of "
157763	157835	157230	157230	traitress	3144	" I noticed more than once , that where retrenchment without substitute would have left unmeaning vacancy , or introduced weakness , he could , and did , improvise whole paragraphs , no less vigorous than irreproachable ; the dialogue - the description - he engrafted was often far better than that he pruned away . Well , on the evening in question , we were sitting silent as nuns in a "
157838	157931	157230	157230	traitress	3144	" the pupils studying , the teachers working . I remember my work ; it was a slight matter of fancy , and it rather interested me ; it had a purpose ; I was not doing it merely to kill time ; I meant it when finished as a gift ; and the occasion of presentation being near , haste was requisite , and my fingers were busy . We heard the sharp bell - peal which we all knew ; then the rapid step familiar to each ear : the words "
157935	157965	157230	157230	traitress	3144	" had scarcely broken simultaneously from every lip , when the two - leaved door split as split it always did for his admission - such a slow word as "
157967	158211	158267	158269	Ne bougez pas	3146	" is inefficient to describe his movements , and he stood in the midst of us . There were two study tables , both long and flanked with benches ; over the centre of each hung a lamp ; beneath this lamp , on either side the table , sat a teacher ; the girls were arranged to the right hand and the left ; the eldest and most studious nearest the lamps or tropics ; the idlers and little ones towards the north and south poles . Monsieur 's habit was politely to hand a chair to some teacher , generally Zelie St. Pierre , the senior mistress ; then to take her vacated seat ; and thus avail himself of the full beam of Cancer or Capricorn , which , owing to his near sight , he needed . As usual , Zelie rose with alacrity , smiling to the whole extent of her mouth , and the full display of her upper and under rows of teeth - that strange smile which passes from ear to ear , and is marked only by a sharp thin curve , which fails to spread over the countenance , and neither dimples the cheek nor lights the eye . I suppose Monsieur did not see her , or he had taken a whim that he would not notice her , for he was as capricious as women are said to be ; then his "
158213	158266	157230	157230	traitress	3144	" he had got another pair served him as an excuse for all sorts of little oversights and shortcomings . Whatever might be his reason , he passed by Zelie , came to the other side of the table , and before I could start up to clear the way , whispered , "
158271	158303	158304	158304	Ginevra	179	" and established himself between me and Miss Fanshawe , who always would be my neighbour , and have her elbow in my side , however often I declared to her , "
158313	158320	158308	158308	you	179	" It was easy to say , "
158325	158364	158366	158366	herself	179	" but how could I help it ? I must make him room , and I must request the pupils to recede that I might recede . It was very well for Ginevra to be gummed to me , "
158369	158504	158304	158304	Ginevra	179	" as she said , on the winter evenings , and harassing my very heart with her fidgetings and pokings , obliging me , indeed , sometimes to put an artful pin in my girdle by way of protection against her elbow ; but I suppose M. Emanuel was not to be subjected to the same kind of treatment , so I swept away my working materials , to clear space for his book , and withdrew myself to make room for his person ; not , however , leaving more than a yard of interval , just what any reasonable man would have regarded as a convenient , respectful allowance of bench . But M. Emanuel never was reasonable ; flint and tinder that he was ! he struck and took fire directly . "
158514	158518	158304	158304	Ginevra	179	" he growled : "
158533	158537	158528	158528	me	0	" he scowled . "
158546	158553	158304	158304	Ginevra	179	" And he set to work . "
158560	158690	158765	158767	le faux dieu	3149	" cried he . The girls rose . He made them all file off to the other table . He then placed me at one extremity of the long bench , and having duly and carefully brought me my work - basket , silk , scissors , all my implements , he fixed himself quite at the other end . At this arrangement , highly absurd as it was , not a soul in the room dared to laugh ; luckless for the giggler would have been the giggle . As for me , I took it with entire coolness . There I sat , isolated and cut off from human intercourse ; I sat and minded my work , and was quiet , and not at all unhappy . "
158697	158701	158765	158767	le faux dieu	3149	" he demanded . "
158707	158710	158765	158767	le faux dieu	3149	" said I. "
158735	158758	158726	158726	moi	3147	" And with this assertion he commenced the reading . For his misfortune he had chosen a French translation of what he called "
158769	158774	158765	158767	le faux dieu	3149	" he further announced , "
158783	159074	158765	158767	le faux dieu	3149	" How far otherwise he would have characterized him had his temper not been upset , I scarcely need intimate . Of course , the translation being French , was very inefficient ; nor did I make any particular effort to conceal the contempt which some of its forlorn lapses were calculated to excite . Not that it behoved or beseemed me to say anything : but one can occasionally look the opinion it is forbidden to embody in words . Monsieur 's lunettes being on the alert , he gleaned up every stray look ; I do n't think he lost one : the consequence was , his eyes soon discarded a screen , that their blaze might sparkle free , and he waxed hotter at the north pole to which he had voluntarily exiled himself , than , considering the general temperature of the room , it would have been reasonable to become under the vertical ray of Cancer itself . The reading over , it appeared problematic whether he would depart with his anger unexpressed , or whether he would give it vent . Suppression was not much in his habits ; but still , what had been done to him definite enough to afford matter for overt reproof ? I had not uttered a sound , and could not justly be deemed amenable to reprimand or penalty for having permitted a slightly freer action than usual to the muscles about my eyes and mouth . The supper , consisting of bread , and milk diluted with tepid water , was brought in . In respectful consideration of the Professor 's presence , the rolls and glasses were allowed to stand instead of being immediately handed round . "
159081	159095	159079	159079	ladies	622	" said he , seeming to be occupied in making marginal notes to his "
159099	159216	159218	159218	he	3152	" They took it . I also accepted a roll and glass , but being now more than ever interested in my work , I kept my seat of punishment , and wrought while I munched my bread and sipped my beverage , the whole with easy sang - froid ; with a certain snugness of composure , indeed , scarcely in my habits , and pleasantly novel to my feelings . It seemed as if the presence of a nature so restless , chafing , thorny as that of M. Paul absorbed all feverish and unsettling influences like a magnet , and left me none but such as were placid and harmonious . He rose . "
159226	159372	159218	159218	he	3152	" Yes ; he turned to the door . No : he re -turned on his steps ; but only , perhaps , to take his pencil - case , which had been left on the table . He took it - shut the pencil in and out , broke its point against the wood , re - cut and pocketed it , and . . . walked promptly up to me . The girls and teachers , gathered round the other table , were talking pretty freely : they always talked at meals ; and , from the constant habit of speaking fast and loud at such times , did not now subdue their voices much . M. Paul came and stood behind me . He asked at what I was working ; and I said I was making a watchguard . He asked , "
159376	159381	159218	159218	he	3152	" And I answered , "
159391	159416	159383	159384	a gentleman	629	" M. Paul stooped down and proceeded - as novel - writers say , and , as was literally true in his case - to "
159418	159468	159628	159628	Fougue	389	" into my ear some poignant words . He said that , of all the women he knew , I was the one who could make herself the most consummately unpleasant : I was she with whom it was least possible to live on friendly terms . I had a "
159472	159597	159628	159628	Fougue	389	" and perverse to a miracle . How I managed it , or what possessed me , he , for his part , did not know ; but with whatever pacific and amicable intentions a person accosted me - crac ! I turned concord to discord , good - will to enmity . He was sure , he - M. Paul - wished me well enough ; he had never done me any harm that he knew of ; he might , at least , he supposed , claim a right to be regarded as a neutral acquaintance , guiltless of hostile sentiments : yet , how I behaved to him ! With what pungent vivacities - what an impetus of mutiny - what a "
159599	159623	159628	159628	Fougue	389	" of injustice ! Here I could not avoid opening my eyes somewhat wide , and even slipping in a slight interjectional observation : "
159635	159636	159630	159630	I	0	" "
159653	159674	159645	159645	I	0	" He was sorry - he was very sorry : for my sake he grieved over the hapless peculiarity . This "
159677	159679	159628	159628	Fougue	389	" this "
159681	159738	159628	159628	Fougue	389	" - generous , perhaps , but excessive - would yet , he feared , do me a mischief . It was a pity : I was not - he believed , in his soul - wholly without good qualities : and would I but hear reason , and be more sedate , more sober , less "
159742	159744	159628	159628	Fougue	389	" less "
159747	159781	159628	159628	Fougue	389	" less taken by show , less prone to set an undue value on outside excellence - to make much of the attentions of people remarkable chiefly for so many feet of stature , "
159787	159788	159925	159925	he	3156	" "
159797	159912	159925	159925	he	3156	" and an enormous amount of fatuity - I might yet prove an useful , perhaps an exemplary character . But , as it was - And here , the little man 's voice was for a minute choked . I would have looked up at him , or held out my hand , or said a soothing word ; but I was afraid , if I stirred , I should either laugh or cry ; so odd , in all this , was the mixture of the touching and the absurd . I thought he had nearly done : but no ; he sat down that he might go on at his ease . "
160069	160089	160090	160090	Scarlet	390	" Again I interrupted , and this time not without an accent at once indignant and horror - struck . "
160116	160117	160175	160175	He	3156	" "
160166	160174	160175	160175	He	3156	" And he sighed over my degeneracy . "
160275	160277	160235	160235	He	3156	" What "
160280	160323	160325	160325	I	0	" he discovered in my present winter merino and plain white collar , I own it puzzled me to guess : and when I asked him , he said it was all made with too much attention to effect - and besides , "
160335	160336	160325	160325	I	0	" "
160364	160418	160351	160351	you	3156	" - holding up my bright little chainlet of silk and gold . His sole reply was a groan - I suppose over my levity . After sitting some minutes in silence , and watching the progress of the chain , at which I now wrought more assiduously than ever , he inquired : "
160436	160492	160494	160494	he	629	" I hardly remember what answer I made , or how it came about ; I do n't think I spoke at all , but I know we managed to bid good - night on friendly terms : and , even after M. Paul had reached the door , he turned back just to explain , "
160508	160509	160494	160494	he	629	" "
160514	160519	160521	160521	he	629	" I threw in ; "
160534	160551	160553	160553	he	629	" the fact was , M. Emanuel 's taste in colours decidedly leaned to the brilliant ; "
160590	160591	160553	160553	he	629	" "
160601	160605	160599	160599	Monsieur	3160	" I asked . "

160975	161154	160967	160967	you	333	" CHAPTER XXIX . MONSIEUR 'S FETE . I was up the next morning an hour before daybreak , and finished my guard , kneeling on the dormitory floor beside the centre stand , for the benefit of such expiring glimmer as the night - lamp afforded in its last watch . All my materials - my whole stock of beads and silk - were used up before the chain assumed the length and richness I wished ; I had wrought it double , as I knew , by the rule of contraries , that to , suit the particular taste whose gratification was in view , an effective appearance was quite indispensable . As a finish to the ornament , a little gold clasp was needed ; fortunately I possessed it in the fastening of my sole necklace ; I duly detached and re - attached it , then coiled compactly the completed guard ; and enclosed it in a small box I had bought for its brilliancy , made of some tropic shell of the colour called "
161157	161411	160967	160967	you	333	" and decked with a little coronal of sparkling blue stones . Within the lid of the box , I carefully graved with my scissors ' point certain initials . The reader will , perhaps , remember the description of Madame Beck 's fete ; nor will he have forgotten that at each anniversary , a handsome present was subscribed for and offered by the school . The observance of this day was a distinction accorded to none but Madame , and , in a modified form , to her kinsman and counsellor , M. Emanuel . In the latter case it was an honour spontaneously awarded , not plotted and contrived beforehand , and offered an additional proof , amongst many others , of the estimation in which - despite his partialities , prejudices , and irritabilities - the professor of literature was held by his pupils . No article of value was offered to him : he distinctly gave it to be understood , that he would accept neither plate nor jewellery . Yet he liked a slight tribute ; the cost , the money - value , did not touch him : a diamond ring , a gold snuff - box , presented , with pomp , would have pleased him less than a flower , or a drawing , offered simply and with sincere feelings . Such was his nature . He was a man , not wise in his generation , yet could he claim a filial sympathy with "
161417	161525	160967	160967	you	333	" M. Paul 's fete fell on the first of March and a Thursday . It proved a fine sunny day ; and being likewise the morning on which it was customary to attend mass ; being also otherwise distinguished by the half - holiday which permitted the privilege of walking out , shopping , or paying visits in the afternoon : these combined considerations induced a general smartness and freshness of dress . Clean collars were in vogue ; the ordinary dingy woollen classe - dress was exchanged for something lighter and clearer . Mademoiselle Zelie St. Pierre , on this particular Thursday , even assumed a "
161530	161553	160967	160967	you	333	" deemed in economical Labassecour an article of hazardous splendour and luxury ; nay , it was remarked that she sent for a "
161555	161665	160967	160967	you	333	" to dress her hair that morning ; there were pupils acute enough to discover that she had bedewed her handkerchief and her hands with a new and fashionable perfume . Poor Zelie ! It was much her wo nt to declare about this time , that she was tired to death of a life of seclusion and labour ; that she longed to have the means and leisure for relaxation ; to have some one to work for her - a husband who would pay her debts she was woefully encumbered with debt , supply her wardrobe , and leave her at liberty , as she said , to "
161672	162228	160967	160967	you	333	" It had long been rumoured , that her eye was upon M. Emanuel . Monsieur Emanuel 's eye was certainly often upon her . He would sit and watch her perseveringly for minutes together . I have seen him give her a quarter - of - an - hour 's gaze , while the class was silently composing , and he sat throned on his estrade , unoccupied . Conscious always of this basilisk attention , she would writhe under it , half - flattered , half - puzzled , and Monsieur would follow her sensations , sometimes looking appallingly acute ; for in some cases , he had the terrible unerring penetration of instinct , and pierced in its hiding - place the last lurking thought of the heart , and discerned under florid veilings the bare ; barren places of the spirit : yes , and its perverted tendencies , and its hidden false curves - all that men and women would not have known - the twisted spine , the malformed limb that was born with them , and far worse , the stain or disfigurement they have perhaps brought on themselves . No calamity so accursed but M. Emanuel could pity and forgive , if it were acknowledged candidly ; but where his questioning eyes met dishonest denial - where his ruthless researches found deceitful concealment - oh , then , he could be cruel , and I thought wicked ! he would exultantly snatch the screen from poor shrinking wretches , passionately hurry them to the summit of the mount of exposure , and there show them all naked , all false - poor living lies - the spawn of that horrid Truth which can not be looked on unveiled . He thought he did justice ; for my part I doubt whether man has a right to do such justice on man : more than once in these his visitations , I have felt compelled to give tears to his victims , and not spared ire and keen reproach to himself . He deserved it ; but it was difficult to shake him in his firm conviction that the work was righteous and needed . Breakfast being over and mass attended , the school - bell rang and the rooms filled : a very pretty spectacle was presented in classe . Pupils and teachers sat neatly arrayed , orderly and expectant , each bearing in her hand the bouquet of felicitation - the prettiest spring - flowers all fresh , and filling the air with their fragrance : I only had no bouquet . I like to see flowers growing , but when they are gathered , they cease to please . I look on them as things rootless and perishable ; their likeness to life makes me sad . I never offer flowers to those I love ; I never wish to receive them from hands dear to me . Mademoiselle St. Pierre marked my empty hands - she could not believe I had been so remiss ; with avidity her eye roved over and round me : surely I must have some solitary symbolic flower somewhere : some small knot of violets , something to win myself praise for taste , commendation for ingenuity . The unimaginative "
162230	162264	162267	162267	you	3172	" proved better than the Parisienne 's fears : she sat literally unprovided , as bare of bloom or leaf as the winter tree . This ascertained , Zelie smiled , well pleased . "
162278	162300	162302	162302	she	3173	" she said : ' silly I have gone and thrown away two francs on a bouquet of hot- house flowers ! "
162357	162361	162352	162352	We	3174	" foot - fall "
162460	162665	162444	162444	he	3175	" and the occasion . Not by the vague folds , sinister and conspirator - like , of his soot- dark paletot were the outlines of his person obscured ; on the contrary , his figure such as it was , I do n't boast of it was well set off by a civilized coat and a silken vest quite pretty to behold . The defiant and pagan bonnet - grec had vanished : bare - headed , he came upon us , carrying a Christian hat in his gloved hand . The little man looked well , very well ; there was a clearness of amity in his blue eye , and a glow of good feeling on his dark complexion , which passed perfectly in the place of beauty : one really did not care to observe that his nose , though far from small , was of no particular shape , his cheek thin , his brow marked and square , his mouth no rose - bud : one accepted him as he was , and felt his presence the reverse of damping or insignificant . He passed to his desk ; he placed on the same his hat and gloves . "
162672	162817	162818	162818	We	3178	" said he , in a tone that somehow made amends to some amongst us for many a sharp snap and savage snarl : not a jocund , good- fellow tone , still less an unctuous priestly , accent , but a voice he had belonging to himself - a voice used when his heart passed the words to his lips . That same heart did speak sometimes ; though an irritable , it was not an ossified organ : in its core was a place , tender beyond a man 's tenderness ; a place that humbled him to little children , that bound him to girls and women to whom , rebel as he would , he could not disown his affinity , nor quite deny that , on the whole , he was better with them than with his own sex . "
162839	163063	162818	162818	We	3178	" said Mademoiselle Zelie , constituting herself spokeswoman of the assembly ; and advancing with no more twists of affectation than were with her indispensable to the achievement of motion , she laid her costly bouquet before him . He bowed over it . The long train of offerings followed : all the pupils , sweeping past with the gliding step foreigners practise , left their tributes as they went by . Each girl so dexterously adjusted her separate gift , that when the last bouquet was laid on the desk , it formed the apex to a blooming pyramid - a pyramid blooming , spreading , and towering with such exuberance as , in the end , to eclipse the hero behind it . This ceremony over , seats were resumed , and we sat in dead silence , expectant of a speech . I suppose five minutes might have elapsed , and the hush remained unbroken ; ten - and there was no sound . Many present began , doubtless , to wonder for what Monsieur waited ; as well they might . Voiceless and viewless , stirless and wordless , he kept his station behind the pile of flowers . At last there issued forth a voice , rather deep , as if it spoke out of a hollow : - "
163070	163076	163077	163077	You	3180	" Mademoiselle Zelie looked round . "
163084	163122	163077	163077	You	3180	" inquired she of the pupils . Yes ; they had all given their nosegays , from the eldest to the youngest , from the tallest to the most diminutive . The senior mistress signified as much . "
163129	163147	163148	163148	Monsieur	3181	" was reiterated in an intonation which , deep before , had now descended some notes lower . "
163150	163168	163148	163148	Monsieur	3181	" said Mademoiselle St. Pierre , rising , and this time speaking with her own sweet smile , "
163236	163237	163220	163221	Meess Lucie	187	" "
163240	163247	163248	163248	you	3181	" I muttered between my teeth : "
163260	163332	163248	163248	you	3181	" The answer vouchsafed to Mademoiselle St Pierre from the estrade was given in the gesticulation of a hand from behind the pyramid . This manual action seemed to deprecate words , to enjoin silence . A form , ere long , followed the hand . Monsieur emerged from his eclipse ; and producing himself on the front of his estrade , and gazing straight and fixedly before him at a vast "
163336	163355	163248	163248	you	3181	" covering the wall opposite , he demanded a third time , and now in really tragic tones - "
163362	163520	163248	163248	you	3181	" I might yet have made all right , by stepping forwards and slipping into his hand the ruddy little shell - box I at that moment held tight in my own . It was what I had fully purposed to do ; but , first , the comic side of Monsieur 's behaviour had tempted me to delay , and now , Mademoiselle St. Pierre 's affected interference provoked contumacity . The reader not having hitherto had any cause to ascribe to Miss Snowe 's character the most distant pretensions to perfection , will be scarcely surprised to learn that she felt too perverse to defend herself from any imputation the Parisienne might choose to insinuate and besides , M. Paul was so tragic , and took my defection so seriously , he deserved to be vexed . I kept , then , both my box and my countenance , and sat insensate as any stone . "
163525	163583	163248	163248	you	3181	" dropped at length from the lips of M. Paul ; and having uttered this phrase , the shadow of some great paroxysm - the swell of wrath , scorn , resolve - passed over his brow , rippled his lips , and lined his cheeks . Gulping down all further comment , he launched into his customary "
163586	163595	163248	163248	you	3181	" I ca n't at all remember what this "
163597	163636	163248	163248	you	3181	" was ; I did not listen to it : the gulping - down process , the abrupt dismissal of his mortification or vexation , had given me a sensation which half- counteracted the ludicrous effect of the reiterated "
163643	163774	163248	163248	you	3181	" Towards the close of the speech there came a pleasing diversion my attention was again amusingly arrested . Owing to some little accidental movement - I think I dropped my thimble on the floor , and in stooping to regain it , hit the crown of my head against the sharp corner of my desk ; which casualties exasperating to me , by rights , if to anybody naturally made a slight bustle - M. Paul became irritated , and dismissing his forced equanimity , and casting to the winds that dignity and self - control with which he never cared long to encumber himself , he broke forth into the strain best calculated to give him ease . I do n't know how , in the progress of his "
163777	163833	163248	163248	you	3181	" he had contrived to cross the Channel and land on British ground ; but there I found him when I began to listen . Casting a quick , cynical glance round the room - a glance which scathed , or was intended to scathe , as it crossed me - he fell with fury upon "
163837	163952	163953	163956	Little wicked venomous man	3187	" Never have I heard English women handled as M. Paul that morning handled them : he spared nothing - neither their minds , morals , manners , nor personal appearance . I specially remember his abuse of their tall stature , their long necks , their thin arms , their slovenly dress , their pedantic education , their impious scepticism ! , their insufferable pride , their pretentious virtue : over which he ground his teeth malignantly , and looked as if , had he dared , he would have said singular things . Oh ! he was spiteful , acrid , savage ; and , as a natural consequence , detestably ugly . "
163958	163962	163248	163248	you	3181	" thought I ; "
163998	164165	163984	163984	you	3188	" I grieve to say I could not quite carry out this resolution . For some time the abuse of England and the English found and left me stolid : I bore it some fifteen minutes stoically enough ; but this hissing cockatrice was determined to sting , and he said such things at last - fastening not only upon our women , but upon our greatest names and best men ; sullying , the shield of Britannia , and dabbling the union jack in mud - that I was stung . With vicious relish he brought up the most spicy current continental historical falsehoods - than which nothing can be conceived more offensive . Zelie , and the whole class , became one grin of vindictive delight ; for it is curious to discover how these clowns of Labassecour secretly hate England . At last , I struck a sharp stroke on my desk , opened my lips , and let loose this cry : - "
164185	164274	164337	164338	the class	6655	" The class was struck of a heap . I suppose they thought me mad . The Professor put up his handkerchief , and fiendishly smiled into its folds . Little monster of malice ! He now thought he had got the victory , since he had made me angry . In a second he became good- humoured . With great blandness he resumed the subject of his flowers ; talked poetically and symbolically of their sweetness , perfume , purity , etcetera ; made Frenchified comparisons between the "
164277	164334	164335	164338	Such of the class	3190	" and the sweet blossoms before him ; paid Mademoiselle St. Pierre a very full - blown compliment on the superiority of her bouquet ; and ended by announcing that the first really fine , mild , and balmy morning in spring , he intended to take the whole class out to breakfast in the country . "
164343	164350	164337	164338	the class	6655	" he added , with emphasis , "
164362	164363	164352	164352	he	3192	" "
164370	164376	164352	164352	he	3192	" declared I , involuntarily . "
164379	164742	164352	164352	he	3192	" was his response ; and , gathering his flowers in his arms , he flashed out of classe ; while I , consigning my work , scissors , thimble , and the neglected little box , to my desk , swept up - stairs . I do n't know whether he felt hot and angry , but I am free to confess that I did . Yet with a strange evanescent anger , I had not sat an hour on the edge of my bed , picturing and repicturing his look , manner , words ere I smiled at the whole scene . A little pang of regret I underwent that the box had not been offered . I had meant to gratify him . Fate would not have it so . In the course of the afternoon , remembering that desks in classe were by no means inviolate repositories , and thinking that it was as well to secure the box , on account of the initials in the lid , P. C. D. E. , for Paul Carl or Carlos David Emanuel - such was his full name - these foreigners must always have a string of baptismals - I descended to the schoolroom . It slept in holiday repose . The day pupils were all gone home , the boarders were out walking , the teachers , except the surveillante of the week , were in town , visiting or shopping ; the suite of divisions was vacant ; so was the grande salle , with its huge solemn globe hanging in the midst , its pair of many - branched chandeliers , and its horizontal grand piano closed , silent , enjoying its mid - week Sabbath . I rather wondered to find the first classe door ajar ; this room being usually locked when empty , and being then inaccessible to any save Madame Beck and myself , who possessed a duplicate key . I wondered still more , on approaching , to hear a vague movement as of life - a step , a chair stirred , a sound like the opening of a desk . "
164752	165568	164746	164747	Madame Beck	190	" was the conclusion following a moment 's reflection . The partially - opened door gave opportunity for assurance on this point . I looked . Behold ! not the inspecting garb of Madame Beck - the shawl and the clean cap - but the coat , and the close - shorn , dark head of a man . This person occupied my chair ; his olive hand held my desk open , his nose was lost to view amongst my papers . His back was towards me , but there could not be a moment 's question about identity . Already was the attire of ceremony discarded : the cherished and ink - stained paletot was resumed ; the perverse bonnet - grec lay on the floor , as if just dropped from the hand , culpably busy . Now I knew , and I had long known , that that hand of M. Emanuel 's was on the most intimate terms with my desk ; that it raised and lowered the lid , ransacked and arranged the contents , almost as familiarly as my own . The fact was not dubious , nor did he wish it to be so : he left signs of each visit palpable and unmistakable ; hitherto , however , I had never caught him in the act : watch as I would , I could not detect the hours and moments of his coming . I saw the brownie 's work in exercises left overnight full of faults , and found next morning carefully corrected : I profited by his capricious good - will in loans full welcome and refreshing . Between a sallow dictionary and worn - out grammar would magically grow a fresh interesting new work , or a classic , mellow and sweet in its ripe age . Out of my work - basket would laughingly peep a romance , under it would lurk the pamphlet , the magazine , whence last evening 's reading had been extracted . Impossible to doubt the source whence these treasures flowed : had there been no other indication , one condemning and traitor peculiarity , common to them all , settled the question - they smelt of cigars . This was very shocking , of course : I thought so at first , and used to open the window with some bustle , to air my desk , and with fastidious finger and thumb , to hold the peccant brochures forth to the purifying breeze . I was cured of that formality suddenly . Monsieur caught me at it one day , understood the inference , instantly relieved my hand of its burden , and , in another moment , would have thrust the same into the glowing stove . It chanced to be a book , on the perusal of which I was bent ; so for once I proved as decided and quicker than himself ; recaptured the spoil , and - having saved this volume - never hazarded a second . With all this , I had never yet been able to arrest in his visits the freakish , friendly , cigar - loving phantom . But now at last I had him : there he was - the very brownie himself ; and there , curling from his lips , was the pale blue breath of his Indian darling : he was smoking into my desk : it might well betray him . Provoked at this particular , and yet pleased to surprise him - pleased , that is , with the mixed feeling of the housewife who discovers at last her strange elfin ally busy in the dairy at the untimely churn - I softly stole forward , stood behind him , bent with precaution over his shoulder . My heart smote me to see that - after this morning 's hostility , after my seeming remissness , after the puncture experienced by his feelings , and the ruffling undergone by his temper - he , all willing to forget and forgive , had brought me a couple of handsome volumes , of which the title and authorship were guarantees for interest . Now , as he sat bending above the desk , he was stirring up its contents ; but with gentle and careful hand ; disarranging indeed , but not harming . My heart smote me : as I bent over him , as he sat unconscious , doing me what good he could , and I daresay not feeling towards me unkindly , my morning 's anger quite melted : I did not dislike Professor Emanuel . I think he heard me breathe . He turned suddenly : his temperament was nervous , yet he never started , and seldom changed colour : there was something hardy about him . "

166842	166860	166629	166629	you	0	" which , as often as not , to shared with some child of the third division . "
166868	166959	166960	166960	We	3218	" said he , re - adjusting his paletot ; and we had no more words on the subject . After looking over the two volumes he had brought , and cutting away some pages with his penknife he generally pruned before lending his books , especially if they were novels , and sometimes I was a little provoked at the severity of his censorship , the retrenchments interrupting the narrative , he rose , politely touched his bonnet - grec , and bade me a civil good - day . "
166965	166969	166962	166962	friends	533	" thought I , "
166977	167182	166962	166962	friends	533	" We might have quarrelled again that very same evening , but , wonderful to relate , failed , for once , to make the most of our opportunity . Contrary to all expectation , M. Paul arrived at the study - hour . Having seen so much of him in the morning , we did not look for his presence at night . No sooner were we seated at lessons , however , than he appeared . I own I was glad to see him , so glad that I could not help greeting his arrival with a smile ; and when he made his way to the same seat about which so serious a misunderstanding had formerly arisen , I took good care not to make too much room for him ; he watched with a jealous , side - long look , to see whether I shrank away , but I did not , though the bench was a little crowded . I was losing the early impulse to recoil from M. Paul . Habituated to the paletot and bonnet- grec , the neighbourhood of these garments seemed no longer uncomfortable or very formidable . I did not now sit restrained , "
167184	167736	166960	166960	We	3218	" as he used to say at his side ; I stirred when I wished to stir , coughed when it was necessary , even yawned when I was tired - did , in short , what I pleased , blindly reliant upon his indulgence . Nor did my temerity , this evening at least , meet the punishment it perhaps merited ; he was both indulgent and good - natured ; not a cross glance shot from his eyes , not a hasty word left his lips . Till the very close of the evening , he did not indeed address me at all , yet I felt , somehow , that he was full of friendliness . Silence is of different kinds , and breathes different meanings ; no words could inspire a pleasanter content than did M. Paul 's worldless presence . When the tray came in , and the bustle of supper commenced , he just said , as he retired , that he wished me a good night and sweet dreams ; and a good night and sweet dreams I had . CHAPTER XXX . M. PAUL . Yet the reader is advised not to be in any hurry with his kindly conclusions , or to suppose , with an over - hasty charity , that from that day M. Paul became a changed character - easy to live with , and no longer apt to flash danger and discomfort round him . No ; he was naturally a little man of unreasonable moods . When over- wrought , which he often was , he became acutely irritable ; and , besides , his veins were dark with a livid belladonna tincture , the essence of jealousy . I do not mean merely the tender jealousy of the heart , but that sterner , narrower sentiment whose seat is in the head . I used to think , as I Sat looking at M. Paul , while he was knitting his brow or protruding his lip over some exercise of mine , which had not as many faults as he wished for he liked me to commit faults : a knot of blunders was sweet to him as a cluster of nuts , that he had points of resemblance to Napoleon Bonaparte . I think so still . In a shameless disregard of magnanimity , he resembled the great Emperor . M. Paul would have quarrelled with twenty learned women , would have unblushingly carried on a system of petty bickering and recrimination with a whole capital of coteries , never troubling himself about loss or lack of dignity . He would have exiled fifty Madame de Staels , if , they had annoyed , offended , outrivalled , or opposed him . I well remember a hot episode of his with a certain Madame Panache - a lady temporarily employed by Madame Beck to give lessons in history . She was clever - that is , she knew a good deal ; and , besides , thoroughly possessed the art of making the most of what she knew ; of words and confidence she held unlimited command . Her personal appearance was far from destitute of advantages ; I believe many people would have pronounced her "
167741	168388	166960	166960	We	3218	" and yet there were points in her robust and ample attractions , as well as in her bustling and demonstrative presence , which , it appeared , the nice and capricious tastes of M. Paul could not away with . The sound of her voice , echoing through the carre , would put him into a strange taking ; her long free step - almost stride - along the corridor , would often make him snatch up his papers and decamp on the instant . With malicious intent he bethought himself , one day , to intrude on her class ; as quick as lightning he gathered her method of instruction ; it differed from a pet plan of his own . With little ceremony , and less courtesy , he pointed out what he termed her errors . Whether he expected submission and attention , I know not ; he met an acrid opposition , accompanied by a round reprimand for his certainly unjustifiable interference . Instead of withdrawing with dignity , as he might still have done , he threw down the gauntlet of defiance . Madame Panache , bellicose as a Penthesilea , picked it up in a minute . She snapped her fingers in the intermeddler 's face ; she rushed upon him with a storm of words . M. Emanuel was eloquent ; but Madame Panache was voluble . A system of fierce antagonism ensued . Instead of laughing in his sleeve at his fair foe , with all her sore amour - propre and loud self - assertion , M. Paul detested her with intense seriousness ; he honoured her with his earnest fury ; he pursued her vindictively and implacably , refusing to rest peaceably in his bed , to derive due benefit from his meals , or even serenely to relish his cigar , till she was fairly rooted out of the establishment . The Professor conquered , but I can not say that the laurels of this victory shadowed gracefully his temples . Once I ventured to hint as much . To my great surprise he allowed that I might be right , but averred that when brought into contact with either men or women of the coarse , self - complacent quality , whereof Madame Panache was a specimen , he had no control over his own passions ; an unspeakable and active aversion impelled him to a war of extermination . Three months afterwards , hearing that his vanquished foe had met with reverses , and was likely to be really distressed for want of employment , he forgot his hatred , and alike active in good and evil , he moved heaven and earth till he found her a place . Upon her coming to make up former differences , and thank him for his recent kindness , the old voice - a little loud - the old manner - a little forward - so acted upon him that in ten minutes he started up and bowed her , or rather himself , out of the room , in a transport of nervous irritation . To pursue a somewhat audacious parallel , in a love of power , in an eager grasp after supremacy , M. Emanuel was like Bonaparte . He was a man not always to be submitted to . Sometimes it was needful to resist ; it was right to stand still , to look up into his eyes and tell him that his requirements went beyond reason - that his absolutism verged on tyranny . The dawnings , the first developments of peculiar talent appearing within his range , and under his rule , curiously excited , even disturbed him . He watched its struggle into life with a scowl ; he held back his hand - perhaps said , "
168396	168454	168392	168392	you	3221	" but would not aid the birth . When the pang and peril of the first conflict were over , when the breath of life was drawn , when he saw the lungs expand and contract , when he felt the heart beat and discovered life in the eye , he did not yet offer to foster . "
168463	168848	168459	168459	I	0	" was his ordinance ; and how difficult he made that proof ! What thorns and briers , what flints , he strewed in the path of feet not inured to rough travel ! He watched tearlessly - ordeals that he exacted should be passed through - fearlessly . He followed footprints that , as they approached the bourne , were sometimes marked in blood - followed them grimly , holding the austerest police - watch over the pain - pressed pilgrim . And when at last he allowed a rest , before slumber might close the eyelids , he opened those same lids wide , with pitiless finger and thumb , and gazed deep through the pupil and the irids into the brain , into the heart , to search if Vanity , or Pride , or Falsehood , in any of its subtlest forms , was discoverable in the furthest recess of existence . If , at last , he let the neophyte sleep , it was but a moment ; he woke him suddenly up to apply new tests : he sent him on irksome errands when he was staggering with weariness ; he tried the temper , the sense , and the health ; and it was only when every severest test had been applied and endured , when the most corrosive aquafortis had been used , and failed to tarnish the ore , that he admitted it genuine , and , still in clouded silence , stamped it with his deep brand of approval . I speak not ignorant of these evils . Till the date at which the last chapter closes , M. Paul had not been my professor - he had not given me lessons , but about that time , accidentally hearing me one day acknowledge an ignorance of some branch of education I think it was arithmetic , which would have disgraced a charity - school boy , as he very truly remarked , he took me in hand , examined me first , found me , I need not say , abundantly deficient , gave me some books and appointed me some tasks . He did this at first with pleasure , indeed with unconcealed exultation , condescending to say that he believed I was "
168854	168876	168459	168459	I	0	" i.e. well enough disposed , and not wholly destitute of parts , but , owing he supposed to adverse circumstances , "
168888	169153	168459	168459	I	0	" The beginning of all effort has indeed with me been marked by a preternatural imbecility . I never could , even in forming a common acquaintance , assert or prove a claim to average quickness . A depressing and difficult passage has prefaced every new page I have turned in life . So long as this passage lasted , M. Paul was very kind , very good , very forbearing ; he saw the sharp pain inflicted , and felt the weighty humiliation imposed by my own sense of incapacity ; and words can hardly do justice to his tenderness and helpfulness . His own eyes would moisten , when tears of shame and effort clouded mine ; burdened as he was with work , he would steal half his brief space of recreation to give to me . But , strange grief ! when that heavy and overcast dawn began at last to yield to day ; when my faculties began to struggle themselves , free , and my time of energy and fulfilment came ; when I voluntarily doubled , trebled , quadrupled the tasks he set , to please him as I thought , his kindness became sternness ; the light changed in his eyes from a beam to a spark ; he fretted , he opposed , he curbed me imperiously ; the more I did , the harder I worked , the less he seemed content . Sarcasms of which the severity amazed and puzzled me , harassed my ears ; then flowed out the bitterest inuendoes against the "
169158	169391	168459	168459	I	0	" I was vaguely threatened with I know not what doom , if I ever trespassed the limits proper to my sex , and conceived a contraband appetite for unfeminine knowledge . Alas ! I had no such appetite . What I loved , it joyed me by any effort to content ; but the noble hunger for science in the abstract - the godlike thirst after discovery - these feelings were known to me but by briefest flashes . Yet , when M. Paul sneered at me , I wanted to possess them more fully ; his injustice stirred in me ambitious wishes - it imparted a strong stimulus - it gave wings to aspiration . In the beginning , before I had penetrated to motives , that uncomprehended sneer of his made my heart ache , but by - and - by it only warmed the blood in my veins , and sent added action to my pulses . Whatever my powers - feminine or the contrary - God had given them , and I felt resolute to be ashamed of no faculty of his bestowal . The combat was very sharp for a time . I seemed to have lost M. Paul 's affection ; he treated me strangely . In his most unjust moments he would insinuate that I had deceived him when I appeared , what he called "
169393	169518	168459	168459	I	0	" - that is incompetent ; he said I had feigned a false incapacity . Again , he would turn suddenly round and accuse me of the most far - fetched imitations and impossible plagiarisms , asserting that I had extracted the pith out of books I had not so much as heard of - and over the perusal of which I should infallibly have fallen down in a sleep as deep as that of Eutychus . Once , upon his preferring such an accusation , I turned upon him - I rose against him . Gathering an armful of his books out of my desk , I filled my apron and poured them in a heap upon his estrade , at his feet . "
169526	169530	169523	169524	M. Paul	196	" I said , "
169559	169773	169546	169546	you	196	" And returning to my desk , I laid my head on my arms , nor would I speak to him for two days afterwards . He pained and chagrined me . His affection had been very sweet and dear - a pleasure new and incomparable : now that this seemed withdrawn , I cared not for his lessons . The books , however , were not taken away ; they were all restored with careful hand to their places , and he came as usual to teach me . He made his peace somehow - too readily , perhaps : I ought to have stood out longer , but when he looked kind and good , and held out his hand with amity , memory refused to reproduce with due force his oppressive moments . And then , reconcilement is always sweet ! On a certain morning a message came from my godmother , inviting me to attend some notable lecture to be delivered in the same public rooms before described . Dr. John had brought the message himself , and delivered it verbally to Rosine , who had not scrupled to follow the steps of M. Emanuel , then passing to the first classe , and , in his presence , stand "
169775	169800	169546	169546	you	196	" before my desk , hand in apron - pocket , and rehearse the same , saucily and aloud , concluding with the words , "
169827	169841	170747	170747	me	0	" When she was gone , my professor demanded of me why I suffered "
169851	169941	170747	170747	me	0	" to address me in such terms . I had no pacifying answer to give . The terms were precisely such as Rosine - a young lady in whose skull the organs of reverence and reserve were not largely developed - was in the constant habit of using . Besides , what she said about the young doctor was true enough . Graham was handsome ; he had fine eyes and a thrilling : glance . An observation to that effect actually formed itself into sound on my lips . "
169949	169953	170747	170747	me	0	" I said . "
169959	169960	169546	169546	you	196	" "
169966	170173	170747	170747	me	0	" The lesson to which we had that day to submit was such as to make us very glad when it terminated . At its close , the released , pupils rushed out , half - trembling , half - exultant . I , too , was going . A mandate to remain arrested me . I muttered that I wanted some fresh air sadly - the stove was in a glow , the classe over - heated . An inexorable voice merely recommended silence ; and this salamander - for whom no room ever seemed too hot - sitting down between my desk and the stove - a situation in which he ought to have felt broiled , but did not - proceeded to confront me with - a Greek quotation ! In M. Emanuel 's soul rankled a chronic suspicion that I knew both Greek and Latin . As monkeys are said to have the power of speech if they would but use it , and are reported to conceal this faculty in fear of its being turned to their detriment , so to me was ascribed a fund of knowledge which I was supposed criminally and craftily to conceal . The privileges of a "
170177	170512	170747	170747	me	0	" it was insinuated , had been mine ; on flowers of Hymettus I had revelled ; a golden store , hived in memory , now silently sustained my efforts , and privily nurtured my wits . A hundred expedients did M. Paul employ to surprise my secret - to wheedle , to threaten , to startle it out of me . Sometimes he placed Greek and Latin books in my way , and then watched me , as Joan of Arc 's jailors tempted her with the warrior 's accoutrements , and lay in wait for the issue . Again he quoted I know not what authors and passages , and while rolling out their sweet and sounding lines the classic tones fell musically from his lips - for he had a good voice - remarkable for compass , modulation , and matchless expression , he would fix on me a vigilant , piercing , and often malicious eye . It was evident he sometimes expected great demonstrations ; they never occurred , however ; not comprehending , of course I could neither be charmed nor annoyed . Baffled - almost angry - he still clung to his fixed idea ; my susceptibilities were pronounced marble - my face a mask . It appeared as if he could not be brought to accept the homely truth , and take me for what I was : men , and women too , must have delusion of some sort ; if not made ready to their hand , they will invent exaggeration for themselves . At moments I did wish that his suspicions had been better founded . There were times when I would have given my right hand to possess the treasures he ascribed to me . He deserved condign punishment for his testy crotchets . I could have gloried in bringing home to him his worst apprehensions astoundingly realized . I could have exulted to burst on his vision , confront and confound his "
170515	170602	170603	170605	Women of intellect	3222	" one blaze of acquirements . Oh ! why did nobody undertake to make me clever while I was young enough to learn , that I might , by one grand , sudden , inhuman revelation - one cold , cruel , overwhelming triumph - have for ever crushed the mocking spirit out of Paul Carl David Emanuel ! Alas ! no such feat was in my power . To - day , as usual , his quotations fell ineffectual : he soon shifted his ground . "
170606	170619	170747	170747	me	0	" was his next theme : here he was at home . A "
170624	170632	170747	170747	me	0	" it appeared , was a sort of "
170636	170720	170747	170747	me	0	" a luckless accident , a thing for which there was neither place nor use in creation , wanted neither as wife nor worker . Beauty anticipated her in the first office . He believed in his soul that lovely , placid , and passive feminine mediocrity was the only pillow on which manly thought and sense could find rest for its aching temples ; and as to work , male mind alone could work to any good practical result - hein ? This "
170723	170744	170747	170747	me	0	" was a note of interrogation intended to draw from me contradiction or objection . However , I only said - "
170757	170762	170751	170751	je	0	" and presently added - "
170778	170782	170747	170747	me	0	" i.e. luncheon . "
170792	170793	170787	170787	You	1465	" "
170798	170802	170795	170795	I	0	" I said ; "
170829	170830	170833	170833	he	3225	" "
170847	170854	170833	170833	he	3225	" And he broke in two the "
170856	170911	170919	170920	an ignoramus	922	" intended for his own refreshment , and gave me half . Truly his bark was worse than his bite ; but the really formidable attack was yet to come . While eating his cake , I could not forbear expressing my secret wish that I really knew all of which he accused me . "
170922	170965	170919	170920	an ignoramus	922	" he asked , in a softened tone . If I had replied meekly by an unqualified affirmative , I believe he would have stretched out his hand , and we should have been friends on the spot , but I answered - "
170997	170998	171001	171001	I	0	" "
171004	171168	171001	171001	I	0	" he inquired , sharply . Unable to answer this question in a breath , I evaded it by change of subject . He had now finished his half of the brioche feeling sure that on so trifling a fragment he could not have satisfied his appetite , as indeed I had not appeased mine , and inhaling the fragrance of baked apples afar from the refectory , I ventured to inquire whether he did not also perceive that agreeable odour . He confessed that he did . I said if he would let me out by the garden - door , and permit me just to run across the court , I would fetch him a plateful ; and added that I believed they were excellent , as Goton had a very good method of baking , or rather stewing fruit , putting in a little spice , sugar , and a glass or two of vin blanc - might I go ? "
171172	171178	171179	171179	I	0	" said he , smiling , "
171234	171876	171974	171974	I	0	" And at last he liberated me on parole . My own plan was to go and return with speed and good faith , to put the plate in at the door , and then to vanish incontinent , leaving all consequences for future settlement . That intolerably keen instinct of his seemed to have anticipated my scheme : he met me at the threshold , hurried me into the room , and fixed me in a minute in my former seat . Taking the plate of fruit from my hand , he divided the portion intended only for himself , and ordered me to eat my share . I complied with no good grace , and vexed , I suppose , by my reluctance , he opened a masked and dangerous battery . All he had yet said , I could count as mere sound and fury , signifying nothing : not so of the present attack . It consisted in an unreasonable proposition with which he had before afflicted me : namely , that on the next public examination - day I should engage - foreigner as I was - to take my place on the first form of first - class pupils , and with them improvise a composition in French , on any subject any spectator might dictate , without benefit of grammar or lexicon . I knew what the result of such an experiment would be . I , to whom nature had denied the impromptu faculty ; who , in public , was by nature a cypher ; whose time of mental activity , even when alone , was not under the meridian sun ; who needed the fresh silence of morning , or the recluse peace of evening , to win from the Creative Impulse one evidence of his presence , one proof of his force ; I , with whom that Impulse was the most intractable , the most capricious , the most maddening of masters him before me always excepted - a deity which sometimes , under circumstances - apparently propitious , would not speak when questioned , would not hear when appealed to , would not , when sought , be found ; but would stand , all cold , all indurated , all granite , a dark Baal with carven lips and blank eye - balls , and breast like the stone face of a tomb ; and again , suddenly , at some turn , some sound , some long - trembling sob of the wind , at some rushing past of an unseen stream of electricity , the irrational demon would wake unsolicited , would stir strangely alive , would rush from its pedestal like a perturbed Dagon , calling to its votary for a sacrifice , whatever the hour - to its victim for some blood , or some breath , whatever the circumstance or scene - rousing its priest , treacherously promising vaticination , perhaps filling its temple with a strange hum of oracles , but sure to give half the significance to fateful winds , and grudging to the desperate listener even a miserable remnant - yielding it sordidly , as though each word had been a drop of the deathless ichor of its own dark veins . And this tyrant I was to compel into bondage , and make it improvise a theme , on a school estrade , between a Mathilde and a Coralie , under the eye of a Madame Beck , for the pleasure , and to the inspiration of a bourgeois of Labassecour ! Upon this argument M. Paul and I did battle more than once - strong battle , with confused noise of demand and rejection , exaction and repulse . On this particular day I was soundly rated . "
171884	171896	171974	171974	I	0	" it seems , was concentrated in me ; I had an "
171901	171960	171974	171974	I	0	" I feared to fail , forsooth ! What did it matter whether I failed or not ? Who was I that I should not fail , like my betters ? It would do me good to fail . He wanted to see me worsted I knew he did , and one minute he paused to take breath . "

172067	172121	171988	171988	I	0	" He supposed then with a sneer - M. Paul could sneer supremely , curling his lip , opening his nostrils , contracting his eyelids - he supposed there was but one form of appeal to which I would listen , and of that form it was not for him to make use . "
172135	172139	171988	171988	I	0	" said he , "

172184	172219	172173	172182	the ' papas ' and ' mammas ' of Villette	3231	" And here , losing patience , I broke out afresh with a cry that I wanted to be liberated - to get out into the air - I was almost in a fever . "
172222	172227	172173	172182	the ' papas ' and ' mammas ' of Villette	3231	" said the inexorable , "

172340	172625	172334	172334	he	3232	" He went to fetch the water . Of course , with a door only on the latch behind me , I lost not my opportunity . Ere his return , his half - worried prey had escaped . CHAPTER XXXI . THE DRYAD . The spring was advancing , and the weather had turned suddenly warm . This change of temperature brought with it for me , as probably for many others , temporary decrease of strength . Slight exertion at this time left me overcome with fatigue - sleepless nights entailed languid days . One Sunday afternoon , having walked the distance of half a league to the Protestant church , I came back weary and exhausted ; and taking refuge in my solitary sanctuary , the first classe , I was glad to sit down , and to make of my desk a pillow for my arms and head . Awhile I listened to the lullaby of bees humming in the berceau , and watched , through the glass door and the tender , lightly - strewn spring foliage , Madame Beck and a gay party of friends , whom she had entertained that day at dinner after morning mass , walking in the centre - alley under orchard boughs dressed at this season in blossom , and wearing a colouring as pure and warm as mountain - snow at sun - rise . My principal attraction towards this group of guests lay , I remember , in one figure - that of a handsome young girl whom I had seen before as a visitor at Madame Beck 's , and of whom I had been vaguely told that she was a "
172628	173126	172334	172334	he	3232	" or god - daughter , of M. Emanuel 's , and that between her mother , or aunt , or some other female relation of hers , and the Professor , had existed of old a special friendship . M. Paul was not of the holiday band to - day , but I had seen this young girl with him ere now , and as far as distant observation could enable me to judge , she seemed to enjoy him with the frank ease of a ward with an indulgent guardian . I had seen her run up to him , put her arm through his , and hang upon him . Once , when she did so , a curious sensation had struck through me - a disagreeable anticipatory sensation - one of the family of presentiments , I suppose - but I refused to analyze or dwell upon it . While watching this girl , Mademoiselle Sauveur by name , and following the gleam of her bright silk robe she was always richly dressed , for she was said to be wealthy through the flowers and the glancing leaves of tender emerald , my eyes became dazzled - they closed ; my lassitude , the warmth of the day , the hum of bees and birds , all lulled me , and at last I slept . Two hours stole over me . Ere I woke , the sun had declined out of sight behind the towering houses , the garden and the room were grey , bees had gone homeward , and the flowers were closing ; the party of guests , too , had vanished ; each alley was void . On waking , I felt much at ease - not chill , as I ought to have been after sitting so still for at least two hours ; my cheek and arms were not benumbed by pressure against the hard desk . No wonder . Instead of the bare wood on which I had laid them , I found a thick shawl , carefully folded , substituted for support , and another shawl both taken from the corridor where such things hung wrapped warmly round me . Who had done this ? Who was my friend ? Which of the teachers ? Which of the pupils ? None , except St. Pierre , was inimical to me ; but which of them had the art , the thought , the habit , of benefiting thus tenderly ? Which of them had a step so quiet , a hand so gentle , but I should have heard or felt her , if she had approached or touched me in a day - sleep ? As to Ginevra Fanshawe , that bright young creature was not gentle at all , and would certainly have pulled me out of my chair , if she had meddled in the matter . I said at last : "
173178	173181	173182	173182	I	0	" methought , "
173198	173400	173150	173150	She	190	" So I opened the glass door and stepped into the berceau . I went to my own alley : had it been dark , or even dusk , I should have hardly ventured there , for I had not yet forgotten the curious illusion of vision if illusion it were experienced in that place some months ago . But a ray of the setting sun burnished still the grey crown of Jean Baptiste ; nor had all the birds of the garden yet vanished into their nests amongst the tufted shrubs and thick wall- ivy . I paced up and down , thinking almost the same thoughts I had pondered that night when I buried my glass jar - how I should make some advance in life , take another step towards an independent position ; for this train of reflection , though not lately pursued , had never by me been wholly abandoned ; and whenever a certain eye was averted from me , and a certain countenance grew dark with unkindness and injustice , into that track of speculation did I at once strike ; so that , little by little , I had laid half a plan . "
173405	173411	173150	173150	She	190	" said I to myself , "
173621	173896	173927	173927	he	3251	" Courage , Lucy Snowe ! With self - denial and economy now , and steady exertion by - and - by , an object in life need not fail you . Venture not to complain that such an object is too selfish , too limited , and lacks interest ; be content to labour for independence until you have proved , by winning that prize , your right to look higher . But afterwards , is there nothing more for me in life - no true home - nothing to be dearer to me than myself , and by its paramount preciousness , to draw from me better things than I care to culture for myself only ? Nothing , at whose feet I can willingly lay down the whole burden of human egotism , and gloriously take up the nobler charge of labouring and living for others ? I suppose , Lucy Snowe , the orb of your life is not to be so rounded : for you , the crescent - phase must suffice . Very good . I see a huge mass of my fellow - creatures in no better circumstances . I see that a great many men , and more women , hold their span of life on conditions of denial and privation . I find no reason why I should be of the few favoured . I believe in some blending of hope and sunshine sweetening the worst lots . I believe that this life is not all ; neither the beginning nor the end . I believe while I tremble ; I trust while I weep . "

174833	174916	174831	174831	he	196	" is a room I have hired , nominally for a study - virtually for a post of observation . There I sit and read for hours together : it is my way - my taste . My book is this garden ; its contents are human nature - female human nature . I know you all by heart . Ah ! I know you well - St. Pierre , the Parisienne - cette maitresse - femme , my cousin Beck herself . "
174917	174925	174812	174812	He	196	" It is not right , Monsieur . "
174926	175044	174812	174812	He	196	" Comment ? it is not right ? By whose creed ? Does some dogma of Calvin or Luther condemn it ? What is that to me ? I am no Protestant . My rich father for , though I have known poverty , and once starved for a year in a garret in Rome - starved wretchedly , often on a meal a day , and sometimes not that - yet I was born to wealth - my rich father was a good Catholic ; and he gave me a priest and a Jesuit for a tutor . I retain his lessons ; and to what discoveries , grand Dieu ! have they not aided me ! "
175045	175056	174831	174831	he	196	" Discoveries made by stealth seem to me dishonourable discoveries . "
175057	175080	174812	174812	He	196	" Puritaine ! I doubt it not . Yet see how my Jesuit 's system works . You know the St. Pierre ? "

175088	175198	175085	175085	He	3264	" You say right - ' partially ' ; whereas I know her thoroughly ; there is the difference . She played before me the amiable ; offered me patte de velours ; caressed , flattered , fawned on me . Now , I am accessible to a woman 's flattery - accessible against my reason . Though never pretty , she was - when I first knew her - young , or knew how to look young . Like all her countrywomen , she had the art of dressing - she had a certain cool , easy , social assurance , which spared me the pain of embarrassment - "
175199	175217	174812	174812	He	196	" Monsieur , that must have been unnecessary . I never saw you embarrassed in my life . "
175218	175248	174812	174812	He	196	" Mademoiselle , you know little of me ; I can be embarrassed as a petite pensionnaire ; there is a fund of modesty and diffidence in my nature - "
175249	175257	175085	175085	He	3264	" Monsieur , I never saw it . "
175258	175272	174812	174812	He	196	" Mademoiselle , it is there . You ought to have seen it . "
175273	175308	174812	174812	He	196	" Monsieur , I have observed you in public - on platforms , in tribunes , before titles and crowned heads - and you were as easy as you are in the third division . "
175309	175439	174812	174812	He	196	" Mademoiselle , neither titles nor crowned heads excite my modesty ; and publicity is very much my element . I like it well , and breathe in it quite freely ; - but - but , in short , here is the sentiment brought into action , at this very moment ; however , I disdain to be worsted by it . If , Mademoiselle , I were a marrying man which I am not ; and you may spare yourself the trouble of any sneer you may be contemplating at the thought , and found it necessary to ask a lady whether she could look upon me in the light of a future husband , then would it be proved that I am as I say - modest "

There had been a strange and inexplicable sound from that quarter , as if the arms of that tree had swayed of their own motion , and its weight of foliage had rushed and crushed against the massive trunk . Yes ; there scarce stirred a breeze , and that heavy tree was convulsed , whilst the feathery shrubs stood still . For some minutes amongst the wood and leafage a rending and heaving went on . Dark as it was , it seemed to me that something more solid than either night - shadow , or branch - shadow , blackened out of the boles . At last the struggle ceased . What birth succeeded this travail ? What Dryad was born of these throes ? We watched fixedly . A sudden bell rang in the house - the prayer - bell . Instantly into our alley there came , out of the berceau , an apparition , all black and white . With a sort of angry rush - close , close past our faces - swept swiftly the very NUN herself ! Never had I seen her so clearly . She looked tall of stature , and fierce of gesture . As she went , the wind rose sobbing ; the rain poured wild and cold ; the whole night seemed to feel her . CHAPTER XXXII . THE FIRST LETTER . Where , it becomes time to inquire , was Paulina Mary ? How fared my intercourse with the sumptuous Hotel Crecy ? That intercourse had , for an interval , been suspended by absence ; M. and Miss de Bassompierre had been travelling , dividing some weeks between the provinces and capital of France . Chance apprised me of their return very shortly after it took place . I was walking one mild afternoon on a quiet boulevard , wandering slowly on , enjoying the benign April sun , and some thoughts not unpleasing , when I saw before me a group of riders , stopping as if they had just encountered , and exchanging greetings in the midst of the broad , smooth , linden - bordered path ; on one side a middle - aged gentleman and young lady , on the other - a young and handsome man . Very graceful was the lady 's mien , choice her appointments , delicate and stately her whole aspect . Still , as I looked , I felt they were known to me , and , drawing a little nearer , I fully recognised them all : the Count Home de Bassompierre , his daughter , and Dr. Graham Bretton . How animated was Graham 's face ! How true , how warm , yet how retiring the joy it expressed ! This was the state of things , this the combination of circumstances , at once to attract and enchain , to subdue and excite Dr. John . The pearl he admired was in itself of great price and truest purity , but he was not the man who , in appreciating the gem , could forget its setting . Had he seen Paulina with the same youth , beauty , and grace , but on foot , alone , unguarded , and in simple attire , a dependent worker , a demi - grisette , he would have thought her a pretty little creature , and would have loved with his eye her movements and her mien , but it required other than this to conquer him as he was now vanquished , to bring him safe under dominion as now , without loss , and even with gain to his manly honour , one saw that he was reduced ; there was about Dr. John all the man of the world ; to satisfy himself did not suffice ; society must approve - the world must admire what he did , or he counted his measures false and futile . In his victrix he required all that was here visible - the imprint of high cultivation , the consecration of a careful and authoritative protection , the adjuncts that Fashion decrees , Wealth purchases , and Taste adjusts ; for these conditions his spirit stipulated ere it surrendered : they were here to the utmost fulfilled ; and now , proud , impassioned , yet fearing , he did homage to Paulina as his sovereign . As for her , the smile of feeling , rather than of conscious power , slept soft in her eyes . They parted . He passed me at speed , hardly feeling the earth he skimmed , and seeing nothing on either hand . He looked very handsome ; mettle and purpose were roused in him fully . "
177939	177947	177948	177948	Lucy	142	" cried a musical , friendly voice . "
177957	177978	177948	177948	Lucy	142	" I hastened to her . She threw back her veil , and stooped from her saddle to kiss me . "
177989	177993	177979	177979	I	0	" said she ; "
178006	178198	178199	178199	Lucy	142	" She named the hour , and I promised compliance . The morrow 's evening found me with her - she and I shut into her own room . I had not seen her since that occasion when her claims were brought into comparison with those of Ginevra Fanshawe , and had so signally prevailed ; she had much to tell me of her travels in the interval . A most animated , rapid speaker was she in such a tete - a- tete , a most lively describer ; yet with her artless diction and clear soft voice , she never seemed to speak too fast or to say too much . My own attention I think would not soon have flagged , but by - and - by , she herself seemed to need some change of subject ; she hastened to wind up her narrative briefly . Yet why she terminated with so concise an abridgment did not immediately appear ; silence followed - a restless silence , not without symptoms of abstraction . Then , turning to me , in a diffident , half - appealing voice - "

It is not a declaration I have often made concerning my acquaintance , in the course of this book : the reader will bear with it for once . Intimate intercourse , close inspection , disclosed in Paulina only what was delicate , intelligent , and sincere ; therefore my regard for her lay deep . An admiration more superficial might have been more demonstrative ; mine , however , was quiet . "

Much pain , much fear , much struggle , would have troubled the very lines of your features , broken their regularity , would have harassed your nerves into the fever of habitual irritation you would have lost in health and cheerfulness , in grace and sweetness . Providence has protected and cultured you , not only for your own sake , but I believe for Graham 's . His star , too , was fortunate : to develop fully the best of his nature , a companion like you was needed : there you are , ready . You must be united . I knew it the first day I saw you together at La Terrasse . In all that mutually concerns you and Graham there seems to me promise , plan , harmony . I do not think the sunny youth of either will prove the forerunner of stormy age . I think it is deemed good that you two should live in peace and be happy - not as angels , but as few are happy amongst mortals . Some lives are thus blessed : it is God 's will : it is the attesting trace and lingering evidence of Eden . Other lives run from the first another course . Other travellers encounter weather fitful and gusty , wild and variable - breast adverse winds , are belated and overtaken by the early closing winter night . Neither can this happen without the sanction of God ; and I know that , amidst His boundless works , is somewhere stored the secret of this last fate 's justice : I know that His treasures contain the proof as the promise of its mercy .

188523	188527	188472	188474	that aged lady	3592	" said he ; "
188590	188612	188613	188614	Justine Marie	429	" I thought the father rather wished to be questioned , and therefore I inquired who had lost and who still mourned "
188616	189219	188613	188614	Justine Marie	429	" I got , in reply , quite a little romantic narrative , told not unimpressively , with the accompaniment of the now subsiding storm . I am bound to say it might have been made much more truly impressive , if there had been less French , Rousseau - like sentimentalizing and wire - drawing ; and rather more healthful carelessness of effect . But the worthy father was obviously a Frenchman born and bred I became more and more persuaded of his resemblance to my confessor - he was a true son of Rome ; when he did lift his eyes , he looked at me out of their corners , with more and sharper subtlety than , one would have thought , could survive the wear and tear of seventy years . Yet , I believe , he was a good old man . The hero of his tale was some former pupil of his , whom he now called his benefactor , and who , it appears , had loved this pale Justine Marie , the daughter of rich parents , at a time when his own worldly prospects were such as to justify his aspiring to a well - dowered hand . The pupil 's father - once a rich banker - had failed , died , and left behind him only debts and destitution . The son was then forbidden to think of Marie ; especially that old witch of a grand - dame I had seen , Madame Walravens , opposed the match with all the violence of a temper which deformity made sometimes demoniac . The mild Marie had neither the treachery to be false , nor the force to be quite staunch to her lover ; she gave up her first suitor , but , refusing to accept a second with a heavier purse , withdrew to a convent , and there died in her noviciate . Lasting anguish , it seems , had taken possession of the faithful heart which worshipped her , and the truth of that love and grief had been shown in a manner which touched even me , as I listened . Some years after Justine Marie 's death , ruin had come on her house too : her father , by nominal calling a jeweller , but who also dealt a good deal on the Bourse , had been concerned in some financial transactions which entailed exposure and ruinous fines . He died of grief for the loss , and shame for the infamy . His old hunchbacked mother and his bereaved wife were left penniless , and might have died too of want ; but their lost daughter 's once - despised , yet most true- hearted suitor , hearing of the condition of these ladies , came with singular devotedness to the rescue . He took on their insolent pride the revenge of the purest charity - housing , caring for , befriending them , so as no son could have done it more tenderly and efficiently . The mother - on the whole a good woman - died blessing him ; the strange , godless , loveless , misanthrope grandmother lived still , entirely supported by this self - sacrificing man . Her , who had been the bane of his life , blighting his hope , and awarding him , for love and domestic happiness , long mourning and cheerless solitude , he treated with the respect a good son might offer a kind mother . He had brought her to this house , "
189222	189235	189240	189240	he	3596	" continued the priest , while genuine tears rose to his eyes , "
189333	189681	189682	189682	Mademoiselle	261	" The father had wiped away his tears before he uttered these last words , and in pronouncing them , he for one instant raised his eyes to mine . I caught this glance , despite its veiled character ; the momentary gleam shot a meaning which struck me . These Romanists are strange beings . Such a one among them - whom you know no more than the last Inca of Peru , or the first Emperor of China - knows you and all your concerns ; and has his reasons for saying to you so and so , when you simply thought the communication sprang impromptu from the instant 's impulse : his plan in bringing it about that you shall come on such a day , to such a place , under such and such circumstances , when the whole arrangement seems to your crude apprehension the ordinance of chance , or the sequel of exigency . Madame Beck 's suddenly - recollected message and present , my artless embassy to the Place of the Magi , the old priest accidentally descending the steps and crossing the square , his interposition on my behalf with the bonne who would have sent me away , his reappearance on the staircase , my introduction to this room , the portrait , the narrative so affably volunteered - all these little incidents , taken as they fell out , seemed each independent of its successor ; a handful of loose beads : but threaded through by that quick - shot and crafty glance of a Jesuit - eye , they dropped pendent in a long string , like that rosary on the prie - dieu . Where lay the link of junction , where the little clasp of this monastic necklace ? I saw or felt union , but could not yet find the spot , or detect the means of connection . Perhaps the musing - fit into which I had by this time fallen , appeared somewhat suspicious in its abstraction ; he gently interrupted : "
189684	189688	189682	189682	Mademoiselle	261	" said he , "
189702	189703	189691	189691	you	261	" "

189783	189807	189778	189778	He	384	" A brief silence fell . The spring of junction seemed suddenly to have become palpable ; I felt it yield to pressure . "
189818	189823	189811	189812	M. Paul	196	" I presently inquired . "
189835	189836	189825	189825	he	384	" "

189887	189918	189882	189882	father	1803	" I continued ; and though I accentuated the question , its utterance was well nigh superfluous ; I was ere this quite prepared for the answer which actually came . "
190050	190085	190047	190047	her	3612	" This struck me as a special state of things - I half - realized myself in that condition also ; passed under discipline , moulded , trained , inoculated , and so on . "
190089	190103	190047	190047	her	3612	" thought I , but I restrained deprecation , and sat quietly enough . "
190113	190133	190107	190107	Paul	196	" I resumed , pursuing a theme which I thought more to the purpose than any wild renegade dreams . "
190227	190228	190243	190245	this M. Emanuel	3628	" "
190232	190238	190243	190245	this M. Emanuel	3628	" murmured I to myself , "
190265	190291	190259	190259	he	4628	" I own I did not reckon amongst the proofs of his greatness , either the act of confession , or the saint - worship . "
190301	190310	190297	190298	that lady	577	" I inquired , looking at Justine Marie . "

190344	190345	190339	190339	he	4628	" "
190363	190434	190339	190339	he	4628	" This was said with marked emphasis . And now the sun broke out pallid and waterish ; the rain yet fell , but there was no more tempest : that hot firmament had cloven and poured out its lightnings . A longer delay would scarce leave daylight for my return , so I rose , thanked the father for his hospitality and his tale , was benignantly answered by a "
190438	190464	190339	190339	he	4628	" which I made kindly welcome , because it seemed uttered with a true benevolence ; but I liked less the mystic phrase accompanying it . "
190475	190538	190465	190465	Daughter	3615	" an oracle that made me shrug my shoulders as soon as I had got outside the door . Few of us know what we are to come to certainly , but for all that had happened yet , I had good hopes of living and dying a sober - minded Protestant : there was a hollowness within , and a flourish around "
190541	190699	190339	190339	he	4628	" which tempted me but moderately . I went on my way pondering many things . Whatever Romanism may be , there are good Romanists : this man , Emanuel , seemed of the best ; touched with superstition , influenced by priestcraft , yet wondrous for fond faith , for pious devotion , for sacrifice of self , for charity unbounded . It remained to see how Rome , by her agents , handled such qualities ; whether she cherished them for their own sake and for God 's , or put them out to usury and made booty of the interest . By the time I reached home , it was sundown . Goton had kindly saved me a portion of dinner , which indeed I needed . She called me into the little cabinet to partake of it , and there Madame Beck soon made her appearance , bringing me a glass of wine . "
190702	190708	190339	190339	he	4628	" began she , chuckling , "
190730	190750	190771	190771	me	0	" I told her what had passed , delivering verbatim the courteous message with which I had been charged . "
190757	190761	190771	190771	me	0	" laughed she . "
190800	190805	190790	190791	son confesseur	3633	" she went on , "
190902	190910	190881	190881	he	3634	" such was Madame 's irreverent remark , "

191020	191745	191003	191004	les Professeurs	3641	" So said Madame Beck . Madame Beck was a wise woman , but she should not have uttered those words . To do so was a mistake . That night she should have left me calm - not excited , indifferent , not interested , isolated in my own estimation and that of others - not connected , even in idea , with this second person whom I was to forget . Forget him ? Ah ! they took a sage plan to make me forget him - the wiseheads ! They showed me how good he was ; they made of my dear little man a stainless little hero . And then they had prated about his manner of loving . What means had I , before this day , of being certain whether he could love at all or not ? I had known him jealous , suspicious ; I had seen about him certain tendernesses , fitfulnesses - a softness which came like a warm air , and a ruth which passed like early dew , dried in the heat of his irritabilities : this was all I had seen . And they , Pere Silas and Modeste Maria Beck that these two wrought in concert I could not doubt opened up the adytum of his heart - showed me one grand love , the child of this southern nature 's youth , born so strong and perfect , that it had laughed at Death himself , despised his mean rape of matter , clung to immortal spirit , and in victory and faith , had watched beside a tomb twenty years . This had been done - not idly : this was not a mere hollow indulgence of sentiment ; he had proven his fidelity by the consecration of his best energies to an unselfish purpose , and attested it by limitless personal sacrifices : for those once dear to her he prized - he had laid down vengeance , and taken up a cross . Now , as for Justine Marie , I knew what she was as well as if I had seen her . I knew she was well enough ; there were girls like her in Madame Beck 's school - phlegmatics - pale , slow , inert , but kind- natured , neutral of evil , undistinguished for good . If she wore angels ' wings , I knew whose poet - fancy conferred them . If her forehead shone luminous with the reflex of a halo , I knew in the fire of whose irids that circlet of holy flame had generation . Was I , then , to be frightened by Justine Marie ? Was the picture of a pale dead nun to rise , an eternal barrier ? And what of the charities which absorbed his worldly goods ? What of his heart sworn to virginity ? Madame Beck - Pere Silas - you should not have suggested these questions . They were at once the deepest puzzle , the strongest obstruction , and the keenest stimulus , I had ever felt . For a week of nights and days I fell asleep - I dreamt , and I woke upon these two questions . In the whole world there was no answer to them , except where one dark little man stood , sat , walked , lectured , under the head - piece of a bandit bonnet - grec , and within the girth of a sorry paletot , much be - inked , and no little adust . After that visit to the Rue des Mages , I did want to see him again . I felt as if - knowing what I now knew - his countenance would offer a page more lucid , more interesting than ever ; I felt a longing to trace in it the imprint of that primitive devotedness , the signs of that half - knightly , half - saintly chivalry which the priest 's narrative imputed to his nature . He had become my Christian hero : under that character I wanted to view him . Nor was opportunity slow to favour ; my new impressions underwent her test the next day . Yes : I was granted an interview with my "
191748	192217	192218	192218	Mademoiselle	261	" - an interview not very heroic , or sentimental , or biblical , but lively enough in its way . About three o'clock of the afternoon , the peace of the first classe - safely established , as it seemed , under the serene sway of Madame Beck , who , in propria persona was giving one of her orderly and useful lessons - this peace , I say , suffered a sudden fracture by the wild inburst of a paletot . Nobody at the moment was quieter than myself . Eased of responsibility by Madame Beck 's presence , soothed by her uniform tones , pleased and edified with her clear exposition of the subject in hand for she taught well , I sat bent over my desk , drawing - that is , copying an elaborate line engraving , tediously working up my copy to the finish of the original , for that was my practical notion of art ; and , strange to say , I took extreme pleasure in the labour , and could even produce curiously finical Chinese facsimiles of steel or mezzotint plates - things about as valuable as so many achievements in worsted - work , but I thought pretty well of them in those days . What was the matter ? My drawing , my pencils , my precious copy , gathered into one crushed - up handful , perished from before my sight ; I myself appeared to be shaken or emptied out of my chair , as a solitary and withered nutmeg might be emptied out of a spice - box by an excited cook . That chair and my desk , seized by the wild paletot , one under each sleeve , were borne afar ; in a second , I followed the furniture ; in two minutes they and I were fixed in the centre of the grand salle - a vast adjoining room , seldom used save for dancing and choral singing - lessons - fixed with an emphasis which seemed to prohibit the remotest hope of our ever being permitted to stir thence again . Having partially collected my scared wits , I found myself in the presence of two men , gentlemen , I suppose I should say - one dark , the other light - one having a stiff , half - military air , and wearing a braided surtout ; the other partaking , in garb and bearing , more of the careless aspect of the student or artist class : both flourishing in full magnificence of moustaches , whiskers , and imperial . M. Emanuel stood a little apart from these ; his countenance and eyes expressed strong choler ; he held forth his hand with his tribune gesture . "
192220	192224	192218	192218	Mademoiselle	261	" said he , "
192317	192540	192311	192311	You	261	" Grand ciel ! Here was the show - trial , so long evaded , come on me like a thunder - clap . These two fine , braided , mustachioed , sneering personages , were none other than dandy professors of the college - Messieurs Boissec and Rochemorte - a pair of cold - blooded fops and pedants , sceptics , and scoffers . It seems that M. Paul had been rashly exhibiting something I had written - something , he had never once praised , or even mentioned , in my hearing , and which I deemed forgotten . The essay was not remarkable at all ; it only seemed remarkable , compared with the average productions of foreign school- girls ; in an English establishment it would have passed scarce noticed . Messieurs Boissec and Rochemorte had thought proper to question its genuineness , and insinuate a cheat ; I was now to bear my testimony to the truth , and to be put to the torture of their examination . A memorable scene ensued . They began with classics . A dead blank . They went on to French history . I hardly knew Merovee from Pharamond . They tried me in various ' ologies , and still only got a shake of the head , and an unchanging "
192546	192696	192311	192311	You	261	" After an expressive pause , they proceeded to matters of general information , broaching one or two subjects which I knew pretty well , and on which I had often reflected . M. Emanuel , who had hitherto stood looking on , dark as the winter - solstice , brightened up somewhat ; he thought I should now show myself at least no fool . He learned his error . Though answers to the questions surged up fast , my mind filling like a rising well , ideas were there , but not words . I either could not , or would not speak - I am not sure which : partly , I think , my nerves had got wrong , and partly my humour was crossed . I heard one of my examiners - he of the braided surtout - whisper to his co - professor , "
192703	192704	192311	192311	You	261	" "
192707	192711	192712	192713	an idiot	6289	" I thought , "
192727	192795	192714	192714	she	3647	" But I suffered - suffered cruelly ; I saw the damps gather on M. Paul 's brow , and his eye spoke a passionate yet sad reproach . He would not believe in my total lack of popular cleverness ; he thought I could be prompt if I would . At last , to relieve him , the professors , and myself , I stammered out : "
192822	193240	192819	192820	an idiot	6289	" I wish I could have spoken with calm and dignity , or I wish my sense had sufficed to make me hold my tongue ; that traitor tongue tripped , faltered . Beholding the judges cast on M. Emanuel a hard look of triumph , and hearing the distressed tremor of my own voice , out I burst in a fit of choking tears . The emotion was far more of anger than grief ; had I been a man and strong , I could have challenged that pair on the spot - but it was emotion , and I would rather have been scourged than betrayed it . The incapables ! Could they not see at once the crude hand of a novice in that composition they called a forgery ? The subject was classical . When M. Paul dictated the trait on which the essay was to turn , I heard it for the first time ; the matter was new to me , and I had no material for its treatment . But I got books , read up the facts , laboriously constructed a skeleton out of the dry bones of the real , and then clothed them , and tried to breathe into them life , and in this last aim I had pleasure . With me it was a difficult and anxious time till my facts were found , selected , and properly jointed ; nor could I rest from research and effort till I was satisfied of correct anatomy ; the strength of my inward repugnance to the idea of flaw or falsity sometimes enabled me to shun egregious blunders ; but the knowledge was not there in my head , ready and mellow ; it had not been sown in Spring , grown in Summer , harvested in Autumn , and garnered through Winter ; whatever I wanted I must go out and gather fresh ; glean of wild herbs my lapful , and shred them green into the pot . Messieurs Boissec and Rochemorte did not perceive this . They mistook my work for the work of a ripe scholar . They would not yet let me go : I must sit down and write before them . As I dipped my pen in the ink with a shaking hand , and surveyed the white paper with eyes half - blinded and overflowing , one of my judges began mincingly to apologize for the pain he caused . "
193256	193270	193273	193273	Monsieur	3651	" said he . Scorn gave me nerve . I only answered , - "
193275	193281	193273	193273	Monsieur	3651	" Rochemorte named this theme : "
193285	193522	193523	193524	Pious mentors	3652	" Human Justice ! What was I to make of it ? Blank , cold abstraction , unsuggestive to me of one inspiring idea ; and there stood M. Emanuel , sad as Saul , and stern as Joab , and there triumphed his accusers . At these two I looked . I was gathering my courage to tell them that I would neither write nor speak another word for their satisfaction , that their theme did not suit , nor their presence inspire me , and that , notwithstanding , whoever threw the shadow of a doubt on M. Emanuel 's honour , outraged that truth of which they had announced themselves the - champions : I meant to utter all this , I say , when suddenly , a light darted on memory . Those two faces looking out of the forest of long hair , moustache , and whisker - those two cold yet bold , trustless yet presumptuous visages - were the same faces , the very same that , projected in full gaslight from behind the pillars of a portico , had half frightened me to death on the night of my desolate arrival in Villette . These , I felt morally certain , were the very heroes who had driven a friendless foreigner beyond her reckoning and her strength , chased her breathless over a whole quarter of the town . "
193526	193529	193523	193524	Pious mentors	3652	" thought I. "
193562	193573	193574	193575	Human Justice	440	" An idea once seized , I fell to work . "
193576	193797	193574	193575	Human Justice	440	" rushed before me in novel guise , a red , random beldame , with arms akimbo . I saw her in her house , the den of confusion : servants called to her for orders or help which she did not give ; beggars stood at her door waiting and starving unnoticed ; a swarm of children , sick and quarrelsome , crawled round her feet , and yelled in her ears appeals for notice , sympathy , cure , redress . The honest woman cared for none of these things . She had a warm seat of her own by the fire , she had her own solace in a short black pipe , and a bottle of Mrs. Sweeny 's soothing syrup ; she smoked and she sipped , and she enjoyed her paradise ; and whenever a cry of the suffering souls about her ' pierced her ears too keenly - my jolly dame seized the poker or the hearth - brush : if the offender was weak , wronged , and sickly , she effectually settled him : if he was strong , lively , and violent , she only menaced , then plunged her hand in her deep pouch , and flung a liberal shower of sugar - plums . Such was the sketch of "
193801	193888	193574	193575	Human Justice	440	" scratched hurriedly on paper , and placed at the service of Messrs. Boissec and Rochemorte . M. Emanuel read it over my shoulder . Waiting no comment , I curtsied to the trio , and withdrew . After school that day , M. Paul and I again met . Of course the meeting did not at first run smooth ; there was a crow to pluck with him ; that forced examination could not be immediately digested . A crabbed dialogue terminated in my being called "
193896	194057	193574	193575	Human Justice	440	" and in Monsieur 's temporary departure . Not wishing him to go quite away , only desiring he should feel that such a transport as he had that day given way to , could not be indulged with perfect impunity , I was not sorry to see him , soon after , gardening in the berceau . He approached the glass door ; I drew near also . We spoke of some flowers growing round it . By - and - by Monsieur laid down his spade ; by - and - by he recommenced conversation , passed to other subjects , and at last touched a point of interest . Conscious that his proceeding of that day was specially open to a charge of extravagance , M. Paul half apologized ; he half regretted , too , the fitfulness of his moods at all times , yet he hinted that some allowance ought to be made for him . "
194060	194064	194065	194065	I	0	" said he , "

194515	194539	194512	194512	you	3679	" With a fearful projection of the under - lip , implying an impetus of scorn the most decided , he broke out - "

195494	195539	195465	195469	the ' Priest 's Pupil	3727	" There was the pupil 's youth , the pupil 's manhood ; - his avarice , his ingratitude , his implacability , his inconstancy . Such a bad pupil , Monsieur ! - so thankless , cold - hearted , unchivalrous , unforgiving ! "

His friendship was not a doubtful , wavering benefit - a cold , distant hope - a sentiment so brittle as not to bear the weight of a finger : I at once felt or thought I felt its support like that of some rock . "
195980	196080	195970	195970	I	0	" he repeated emphatically ; and I could hardly believe that words so earnest had blessed my ear ; I hardly could credit the reality of that kind , anxious look he gave . If he really wished for my confidence and regard , and really would give me his - why , it seemed to me that life could offer nothing more or better . In that case , I was become strong and rich : in a moment I was made substantially happy . To ascertain the fact , to fix and seal it , I asked - "

I envied no girl her lover , no bride her bridegroom , no wife her husband ; I was content with this my voluntary , self - offering friend . If he would but prove reliable , and he looked reliable , what , beyond his friendship , could I ever covet ? But , if all melted like a dream , as once before had happened - ? "
196331	196520	196521	196521	Lucy	142	" said he , as this thought threw its weight on my heart , its shadow on my countenance . I told him ; and after a moment 's pause , and a thoughtful smile , he showed me how an equal fear - lest I should weary of him , a man of moods so difficult and fitful - had haunted his mind for more than one day , or one month . On hearing this , a quiet courage cheered me . I ventured a word of re - assurance . That word was not only tolerated ; its repetition was courted . I grew quite happy - strangely happy - in making him secure , content , tranquil . Yesterday , I could not have believed that earth held , or life afforded , moments like the few I was now passing . Countless times it had been my lot to watch apprehended sorrow close darkly in ; but to see unhoped - for happiness take form , find place , and grow more real as the seconds sped , was indeed a new experience .

Her mother was going into town to call on some English family , who had applied for a prospectus : my services were needed as interpreter . The interruption was not unseasonable : sufficient for the day is always the evil ; for this hour , its good sufficed . Yet I should have liked to ask M. Paul whether the "

Besides Fifine Beck 's mother , another power had a word to say to M. Paul and me , before that covenant of friendship could be ratified . We were under the surveillance of a sleepless eye : Rome watched jealously her son through that mystic lattice at which I had knelt once , and to which M. Emanuel drew nigh month by month - the sliding panel of the confessional . "

200754	200757	200758	200758	he	196	" Maladroit ! "
200772	200815	200758	200758	he	196	" He put Sylvie down , making her lie quiet beside his bonnet - grec , and , depriving me of the pens and penknife , proceeded to slice , nib , and point with the accuracy and celerity of a machine . "
200823	200838	200817	200817	I	0	" he now inquired . Suppressing a yawn , I said I hardly knew . "
200844	200845	200817	200817	I	0	" "
200856	200861	200817	200817	I	0	" After a pause : "
200922	200923	200874	200874	him	196	" "
200926	200934	200874	200874	him	196	" I responded , rousing myself quickly , "
200946	201092	200874	200874	him	196	" And in proof , I drew from my pocket a perfectly dry handkerchief , still clean and in its folds . Hereupon I was made the object of a string of strictures rather piquant than polite . I listened with zest . After those two days of unnatural silence , it was better than music to hear M. Paul haranguing again just in his old fashion . I listened , and meantime solaced myself and Sylvie with the contents of a bonbonniere , which M. Emanuel 's gifts kept well supplied with chocolate comfits : It pleased him to see even a small matter from his hand duly appreciated . He looked at me and the spaniel while we shared the spoil ; he put up his penknife . Touching my hand with the bundle of new - cut quills , he said : - "
201114	201153	201104	201104	you	3858	" But of this question I would take no manner of notice ; its purport made my eyes fill . I caressed Sylvie assiduously . M. Paul , leaning - over the desk , bent towards me : - "
201160	201164	201154	201154	I	0	" he said : "
201219	201220	201208	201210	My best friends	3862	" "
201236	201237	201208	201210	My best friends	3862	" "
201348	201349	201345	201345	Lucifer	262	" "
201361	201362	201351	201351	I	0	" "
201443	201444	201445	201445	Monsieur	3866	" "
201519	201520	201518	201518	I.	0	" "
201556	201828	201550	201551	Pere Silas	289	" By dint of persuasion , I made him half - define these hints ; they amounted to crafty Jesuit - slanders . That night M. Paul and I talked seriously and closely . He pleaded , he argued . I could not argue - a fortunate incapacity ; it needed but triumphant , logical opposition to effect all the director wished to be effected ; but I could talk in my own way - the way M. Paul was used to - and of which he could follow the meanderings and fill the hiatus , and pardon the strange stammerings , strange to him no longer . At ease with him , I could defend my creed and faith in my own fashion ; in some degree I could lull his prejudices . He was not satisfied when he went away , hardly was he appeased ; but he was made thoroughly to feel that Protestants were not necessarily the irreverent Pagans his director had insinuated ; he was made to comprehend something of their mode of honouring the Light , the Life , the Word ; he was enabled partly to perceive that , while their veneration for things venerable was not quite like that cultivated in his Church , it had its own , perhaps , deeper power - its own more solemn awe . I found that Pere Silas himself , I must repeat , not a bad man , though the advocate of a bad cause had darkly stigmatized Protestants in general , and myself by inference , with strange names , had ascribed to us strange "
201831	202117	202118	202118	Marie	429	" Monsieur Emanuel revealed all this in his frank fashion , which knew not secretiveness , looking at me as he spoke with a kind , earnest fear , almost trembling lest there should be truth in the charges . Pere Silas , it seems , had closely watched me , had ascertained that I went by turns , and indiscriminately , to the three Protestant Chapels of Villette - the French , German , and English - i d est , the Presbyterian , Lutheran , Episcopalian . Such liberality argued in the father 's eyes profound indifference - who tolerates all , he reasoned , can be attached to none . Now , it happened that I had often secretly wondered at the minute and unimportant character of the differences between these three sects - at the unity and identity of their vital doctrines : I saw nothing to hinder them from being one day fused into one grand Holy Alliance , and I respected them all , though I thought that in each there were faults of form , incumbrances , and trivialities . Just what I thought , that did I tell M. Emanuel , and explained to him that my own last appeal , the guide to which I looked , and the teacher which I owned , must always be the Bible itself , rather than any sect , of whatever name or nation . He left me soothed , yet full of solicitude , breathing a wish , as strong as a prayer , that if I were wrong , Heaven would lead me right . I heard , poured forth on the threshold , some fervid murmurings to "
202124	202509	202120	202122	Reine du Ciel	448	" some deep aspiration that his hope might yet be mine . Strange ! I had no such feverish wish to turn him from the faith of his fathers . I thought Romanism wrong , a great mixed image of gold and clay ; but it seemed to me that this Romanist held the purer elements of his creed with an innocency of heart which God must love . The preceding conversation passed between eight and nine o'clock of the evening , in a schoolroom of the quiet Rue Fossette , opening on a sequestered garden . Probably about the same , or a somewhat later hour of the succeeding evening , its echoes , collected by holy obedience , were breathed verbatim in an attent ear , at the panel of a confessional , in the hoary church of the Magi . It ensued that Pere Silas paid a visit to Madame Beck , and stirred by I know not what mixture of motives , persuaded her to let him undertake for a time the Englishwoman 's spiritual direction . Hereupon I was put through a course of reading - that is , I just glanced at the books lent me ; they were too little in my way to be thoroughly read , marked , learned , or inwardly digested . And besides , I had a book up - stairs , under my pillow , whereof certain chapters satisfied my needs in the article of spiritual lore , furnishing such precept and example as , to my heart 's core , I was convinced could not be improved on . Then Pere Silas showed me the fair side of Rome , her good works ; and bade me judge the tree by its fruits . In answer , I felt and I avowed that these works were not the fruits of Rome ; they were but her abundant blossoming , but the fair promise she showed the world , That bloom , when set , savoured not of charity ; the apple full formed was ignorance , abasement , and bigotry . Out of men 's afflictions and affections were forged the rivets of their servitude . Poverty was fed and clothed , and sheltered , to bind it by obligation to "
202513	202528	202529	202530	the Church	5217	" orphanage was reared and educated that it might grow up in the fold of "
202532	202548	202120	202122	Reine du Ciel	448	" sickness was tended that it might die after the formula and in the ordinance of "
202552	202612	202120	202122	Reine du Ciel	448	" and men were overwrought , and women most murderously sacrificed , and all laid down a world God made pleasant for his creatures ' good , and took up a cross , monstrous in its galling weight , that they might serve Rome , prove her sanctity , confirm her power , and spread the reign of her tyrant "
202615	202697	202120	202122	Reine du Ciel	448	" For man 's good was little done ; for God 's glory , less . A thousand ways were opened with pain , with blood - sweats , with lavishing of life ; mountains were cloven through their breasts , and rocks were split to their base ; and all for what ? That a Priesthood might march straight on and straight upward to an all - dominating eminence , whence they might at last stretch the sceptre of their Moloch "
202700	203110	203111	203111	I	0	" It will not be . God is not with Rome , and , were human sorrows still for the Son of God , would he not mourn over her cruelties and ambitions , as once he mourned over the crimes and woes of doomed Jerusalem ! Oh , lovers of power ! Oh , mitred aspirants for this world 's kingdoms ! an hour will come , even to you , when it will be well for your hearts - pausing faint at each broken beat - that there is a Mercy beyond human compassions , a Love , stronger than this strong death which even you must face , and before it , fall ; a Charity more potent than any sin , even yours ; a Pity which redeems worlds - nay , absolves Priests . My third temptation was held out in the pomp of Rome - the glory of her kingdom . I was taken to the churches on solemn occasions - days of fete and state ; I was shown the Papal ritual and ceremonial . I looked at it . Many people - men and women - no doubt far my superiors in a thousand ways , have felt this display impressive , have declared that though their Reason protested , their Imagination was subjugated . I can not say the same . Neither full procession , nor high mass , nor swarming tapers , nor swinging censers , nor ecclesiastical millinery , nor celestial jewellery , touched my imagination a whit . What I saw struck me as tawdry , not grand ; as grossly material , not poetically spiritual . This I did not tell Pere Silas ; he was old , he looked venerable : through every abortive experiment , under every repeated disappointment , he remained personally kind to me , and I felt tender of hurting his feelings . But on the evening of a certain day when , from the balcony of a great house , I had been made to witness a huge mingled procession of the church and the army - priests with relics , and soldiers with weapons , an obese and aged archbishop , habited in cambric and lace , looking strangely like a grey daw in bird - of- paradise plumage , and a band of young girls fantastically robed and garlanded - then I spoke my mind to M. Paul . "
203117	203122	203111	203111	I	0	" I told him ; "
203137	203402	203403	203403	God	164	" And having relieved my conscience by this declaration , I was able to go on , and , speaking more currently and clearly than my wo nt , to show him that I had a mind to keep to my reformed creed ; the more I saw of Popery the closer I clung to Protestantism ; doubtless there were errors in every church , but I now perceived by contrast how severely pure was my own , compared with her whose painted and meretricious face had been unveiled for my admiration . I told him how we kept fewer forms between us and God ; retaining , indeed , no more than , perhaps , the nature of mankind in the mass rendered necessary for due observance . I told him I could not look on flowers and tinsel , on wax- lights and embroidery , at such times and under such circumstances as should be devoted to lifting the secret vision to Him whose home is Infinity , and His being - Eternity . That when I thought of sin and sorrow , of earthly corruption , mortal depravity , weighty temporal woe - I could not care for chanting priests or mumming officials ; that when the pains of existence and the terrors of dissolution pressed before me - when the mighty hope and measureless doubt of the future arose in view - then , even the scientific strain , or the prayer in a language learned and dead , harassed : with hindrance a heart which only longed to cry - "
203412	203459	203403	203403	God	164	" When I had so spoken , so declared my faith , and so widely severed myself , from him I addressed - then , at last , came a tone accordant , an echo responsive , one sweet chord of harmony in two conflicting spirits . "
203466	203471	203462	203462	priests	7156	" murmured M. Emanuel , "
203524	203541	203507	203507	I	0	" He leaned on the back of my chair . After some thought he again spoke : "
203675	203687	203632	203632	He	164	" God guide us all ! God bless you , Lucy ! "
204270	204273	204267	204267	his	135	" little Polly "
204375	204383	204356	204356	she	141	" Graham , I do like you ! "
204465	204470	204461	204461	she	141	" a pretty dimple , "
204487	204507	204461	204461	she	141	" nice , strange face ; far nicer , far stranger , than either his mamma or Lucy Snowe . "
204508	204514	204516	204516	Paulina	141	" Child as I was , "
204518	204611	204516	204516	Paulina	141	" I wonder how I dared be so venturous . To me he seems now all sacred , his locks are inaccessible , and , Lucy , I feel a sort of fear , when I look at his firm , marble chin , at his straight Greek features . Women are called beautiful , Lucy ; he is not like a woman , therefore I suppose he is not beautiful , but what is he , then ? Do other people see him with my eyes ? Do you admire him ? "
204612	204623	204626	204626	my	0	" I 'll tell you what I do , Paulina , "
204633	204695	204709	204709	her	3896	" I never see him . I looked at him twice or thrice about a year ago , before he recognised me , and then I shut my eyes ; and if he were to cross their balls twelve times between each day 's sunset and sunrise , except from memory , I should hardly know what shape had gone by . "
204696	204704	204706	204706	she	3896	" Lucy , what do you mean ? "
204712	204727	204706	204706	she	3896	" I mean that I value vision , and dread being struck stone blind . "
204849	204856	204857	204857	she	3896	" Spartan girl ! Proud Lucy ! "
204865	204891	204857	204857	she	3896	" Graham says you are the most peculiar , capricious little woman he knows ; but yet you are excellent ; we both think so . "
204892	204901	204903	204903	I.	0	" You both think you know not what , "
204904	204934	204903	204903	I.	0	" Have the goodness to make me as little the subject of your mutual talk and thoughts as possible . I have my sort of life apart from yours . "
204935	204957	204857	204857	she	3896	" But ours , Lucy , is a beautiful life , or it will be ; and you shall share it . "
204958	205003	204857	204857	she	3896	" I shall share no man 's or woman 's life in this world , as you understand sharing . I think I have one friend of my own , but am not sure ; and till I am sure , I live solitary . "
205004	205010	204903	204903	I.	0	" But solitude is sadness . "
205011	205036	204857	204857	she	3896	" Yes ; it is sadness . Life , however ; has worse than that . Deeper than melancholy , lies heart - break . "
205037	205050	204857	204857	she	3896	" Lucy , I wonder if anybody will ever comprehend you altogether . "
205281	205293	205298	205298	her	141	" I wish papa knew ; I do wish papa knew ! "
205302	205398	205298	205298	her	141	" I wish , and yet I fear . I can hardly keep Graham back from telling him . There is nothing I long for more than to have this affair settled - to speak out candidly ; and yet I dread the crisis . I know , I am certain , papa will be angry at the first ; I fear he will dislike me almost ; it will seem to him an untoward business ; it will be a surprise , a shock : I can hardly foresee its whole effect on him .

205571	205575	205577	205577	he	178	" Miss Snowe , "
205583	205593	205577	205577	he	178	" do you know my little girl 's age ? "
205594	205604	205542	205542	he	178	" About eighteen , is it not , sir ? "
205605	205669	205577	205577	he	178	" It seems so . This old pocket - book tells me she was born on the 5th of May , in the year 18 - , eighteen years ago . It is strange ; I had lost the just reckoning of her age . I thought of her as twelve - fourteen - an indefinite date ; but she seemed a child . "
205670	205676	205677	205677	I	0	" She is about eighteen , "
205680	205692	205677	205677	I	0	" She is grown up ; she will be no taller . "

205758	205778	205755	205755	he	178	" and now others will find out that she is pure and of price : they will covet her . "
205908	205913	205914	205914	he	178	" Where is she ? "
205917	205924	205914	205914	he	178	" She is up - stairs . "
205925	205931	205887	205887	he	178	" What is she doing ? "
205932	205937	205887	205887	he	178	" She is writing . "
205938	205950	205914	205914	he	178	" She writes , does she ? Does she receive letters ? "
205951	205975	205887	205887	he	178	" None but such as she can show me . And - sir - she - they have long wanted to consult you . "

205997	206031	205887	205887	he	178	" Ah , M. de Bassompierre - not so - that ca n't be ! But Paulina must speak for herself : and Dr. Bretton , too , must be his own advocate . "
206032	206046	205887	205887	he	178	" It is a little late . Matters are advanced , it seems . "
206047	206064	205887	205887	he	178	" Sir , till you approve , nothing is done - only they love each other . "
206065	206068	206069	206069	he	3908	" Only ! "
206090	206121	206083	206083	I	0	" Hundreds of times has Dr. Bretton been on the point of appealing to you , sir ; but , with all his high courage , he fears you mortally . "
206122	206165	205887	205887	he	178	" He may well - he may well fear me . He has touched the best thing I have . Had he but let her alone , she would have remained a child for years yet . So . Are they engaged ? "
206166	206176	205887	205887	he	178	" They could not become engaged without your permission . "
206177	206269	205887	205887	he	178	" It is well for you , Miss Snowe , to talk and think with that propriety which always characterizes you ; but this matter is a grief to me ; my little girl was all I had : I have no more daughters and no son ; Bretton might as well have looked elsewhere ; there are scores of rich and pretty women who would not , I daresay , dislike him : he has looks , and conduct , and connection . Would nothing serve him but my Polly ? "
206270	206298	205887	205887	he	178	" If he had never seen your ' Polly , ' others might and would have pleased him - your niece , Miss Fanshawe , for instance . "
206299	206337	206338	206338	he	3910	" Ah ! I would have given him Ginevra with all my heart ; but Polly ! - I ca n't let him have her . No - I ca n't . He is not her equal , "
206344	206381	206338	206338	he	3910	" In what particular is he her match ? They talk of fortune ! I am not an avaricious or interested man , but the world thinks of these things - and Polly will be rich . "
206382	206389	206391	206391	I	0	" Yes , that is known , "
206393	206402	206391	206391	I	0	" all Villette knows her as an heiress . "
206403	206415	205887	205887	he	178	" Do they talk of my little girl in that light ? "
206416	206422	206423	206423	He	3910	" They do , sir . "
206434	206480	206429	206429	I	0	" Would you , sir , think any one Paulina 's match ? Would you prefer any other to Dr. Bretton ? Do you think higher rank or more wealth would make much difference in your feelings towards a future son - in - law ? "
206481	206487	206489	206489	he	3910	" You touch me there , "
206491	206507	206489	206489	he	3910	" Look at the aristocracy of Villette - you would not like them , sir ? "
206508	206525	205887	205887	he	178	" I should not - never a duc , baron , or vicomte of the lot . "
206526	206540	206541	206541	I	0	" I am told many of these persons think about her , sir , "
206557	206604	205887	205887	he	178	" Other suitors will come , therefore , if Dr. Bretton is refused . Wherever you go , I suppose , aspirants will not be wanting . Independent of heiress - ship , it appears to me that Paulina charms most of those who see her . "
206605	206620	205887	205887	he	178	" Does she ? How ? My little girl is not thought a beauty . "
206621	206631	205887	205887	he	178	" Sir , Miss de Bassompierre is very beautiful . "
206632	206702	205887	205887	he	178	" Nonsense ! - begging your pardon , Miss Snowe , but I think you are too partial . I like Polly : I like all her ways and all her looks - but then I am her father ; and even I never thought about beauty . She is amusing , fairy - like , interesting to me ; - you must be mistaken in supposing her handsome ? "
206703	206721	205887	205887	he	178	" She attracts , sir : she would attract without the advantages of your wealth and position . "
206722	206741	205887	205887	he	178	" My wealth and position ! Are these any bait to Graham ? If I thought so - - "
206742	206804	205887	205887	he	178	" Dr. Bretton knows these points perfectly , as you may be sure , M. de Bassompierre , and values them as any gentleman would - as you would yourself , under the same circumstances - but they are not his baits . He loves your daughter very much ; he feels her finest qualities , and they influence him worthily . "
206805	206817	205887	205887	he	178	" What ! has my little pet ' fine qualities ? ' "
206818	206840	205887	205887	he	178	" Ah , sir ! did you observe her that evening when so many men of eminence and learning dined here ? "
206841	206861	205887	205887	he	178	" I certainly was rather struck and surprised with her manner that day ; its womanliness made me smile . "
206862	206879	205887	205887	he	178	" And did you see those accomplished Frenchmen gather round her in the drawing - room ? "
206880	206906	205887	205887	he	178	" I did ; but I thought it was by way of relaxation - as one might amuse one 's self with a pretty infant . "
206907	206939	205887	205887	he	178	" Sir , she demeaned herself with distinction ; and I heard the French gentlemen say she was ' petrie d'esprit et de graces . ' Dr. Bretton thought the same . "
206940	207049	207051	207051	he	3911	" She is a good , dear child , that is certain ; and I do believe she has some character . When I think of it , I was once ill ; Polly nursed me ; they thought I should die ; she , I recollect , grew at once stronger and tenderer as I grew worse in health . And as I recovered , what a sunbeam she was in my sick - room ! Yes ; she played about my chair as noiselessly and as cheerful as light . And now she is sought in marriage ! I do n't want to part with her , "
207057	207068	207069	207069	I	0	" You have known Dr. and Mrs. Bretton so long , "
207072	207088	207089	207089	He	3911	" it would be less like separation to give her to him than to another . "
207094	207104	207105	207105	he	3911	" True . I have long known Louisa Bretton , "
207108	207243	207105	207105	he	3911	" She and I are indeed old , old friends ; a sweet , kind girl she was when she was young . You talk of beauty , Miss Snowe ! she was handsome , if you will - tall , straight , and blooming - not the mere child or elf my Polly seems to me : at eighteen , Louisa had a carriage and stature fit for a princess . She is a comely and a good woman now . The lad is like her ; I have always thought so , and favoured and wished him well . Now he repays me by this robbery ! My little treasure used to love her old father dearly and truly . It is all over now , doubtless - I am an incumbrance . "
207249	207252	207256	207256	She	3913	" little treasure "
207370	207373	207375	207377	M. de Bassompierre	178	" Polly , "
207389	207402	207375	207377	M. de Bassompierre	178	" do you blush at seeing papa ? That is something new . "
207403	207414	207416	207416	she	3913	" I do n't blush - I never do blush , "
207429	207446	207375	207377	M. de Bassompierre	178	" But I thought you were in the dining - room , and I wanted Lucy . "
207447	207498	207375	207377	M. de Bassompierre	178	" You thought I was with John Graham Bretton , I suppose ? But he has just been called out : he will be back soon , Polly . He can post your letter for you ; it will save Matthieu a ' course , ' as he calls it . "
207499	207506	207508	207508	she	3913	" I do n't post letters , "
207513	207530	207508	207508	she	3913	" What do you do with them , then ? - come here and tell me . "
207544	207549	207552	207552	she	3913	" Shall I come ? "
207555	207593	207552	207552	she	3913	" How long is it since you became a letter - writer , Polly ? It only seems yesterday when you were at your pot - hooks , labouring away absolutely with both hands at the pen . "
207594	207633	207375	207377	M. de Bassompierre	178	" Papa , they are not letters to send to the post in your letter - bag ; they are only notes , which I give now and then into the person 's hands , just to satisfy . "
207634	207646	207552	207552	she	3913	" The person ! That means Miss Snowe , I suppose ? "
207647	207655	207552	207552	she	3913	" No , papa - not Lucy . "
207656	207664	207375	207377	M. de Bassompierre	178	" Who then ? Perhaps Mrs. Bretton ? "
207665	207674	207552	207552	she	3913	" No , papa - not Mrs. Bretton . "
207675	207689	207552	207552	she	3913	" Who , then , my little daughter ? Tell papa the truth . "
207690	207695	207696	207696	she	3915	" Oh , papa ! "
207701	207729	207696	207696	she	3915	" I will - I will tell you the truth - all the truth ; I am glad to tell you - glad , though I tremble . "
207748	207780	207781	207781	She	3915	" I hate to hide my actions from you , papa . I fear you and love you above everything but God . Read the letter ; look at the address . "
207825	207847	207806	207806	He	3916	" Can she write so - the little thing that stood at my knee but yesterday ? Can she feel so ? "
207848	207860	207806	207806	He	3916	" Papa , is it wrong ? Does it pain you ? "
207861	207879	207806	207806	He	3916	" There is nothing wrong in it , my innocent little Mary ; but it pains me . "
207880	207902	207806	207806	He	3916	" But , papa , listen ! You shall not be pained by me . I would give up everything - almost "
207906	207922	207806	207806	He	3916	" I would die rather than make you unhappy ; that would be too wicked ! "
207926	207956	207923	207923	She	3915	" Does the letter not please you ? Must it not go ? Must it be torn ? It shall , for your sake , if you order it . "
207957	207962	207806	207806	He	3916	" I order nothing . "
207963	208015	207806	207806	He	3916	" Order something , papa ; express your wish ; only do n't hurt , do n't grieve Graham . I can not , can not bear that . I love you , papa ; but I love Graham too - because - because - it is impossible to help it . "
208016	208108	207923	207923	She	3915	" This splendid Graham is a young scamp , Polly - that is my present notion of him : it will surprise you to hear that , for my part , I do not love him one whit . Ah ! years ago I saw something in that lad 's eye I never quite fathomed - something his mother has not - a depth which warned a man not to wade into that stream too far ; now , suddenly , I find myself taken over the crown of the head . "
208109	208179	207806	207806	He	3916	" Papa , you do n't - you have not fallen in ; you are safe on the bank ; you can do as you please ; your power is despotic ; you can shut me up in a convent , and break Graham 's heart to - morrow , if you choose to be so cruel . Now , autocrat , now czar , will you do this ? "
208180	208210	207806	207806	He	3916	" Off with him to Siberia , red whiskers and all ; I say , I do n't like him , Polly , and I wonder that you should . "
208211	208214	208216	208216	she	3918	" Papa , "
208218	208257	208216	208216	she	3918	" do you know you are very naughty ? I never saw you look so disagreeable , so unjust , so almost vindictive before . There is an expression in your face which does not belong to you . "
208258	208263	208265	208266	Mr. Home	134	" Off with him ! "
208282	208317	208265	208266	Mr. Home	134	" but , I suppose , if he went , Polly would pack a bundle and run after him ; her heart is fairly won - won , and weaned from her old father . "
208318	208357	207806	207806	He	3916	" Papa , I say it is naughty , it is decidedly wrong , to talk in that way . I am not weaned from you , and no human being and no mortal influence can wean me . "
208358	208381	208265	208266	Mr. Home	134	" Be married , Polly ! Espouse the red whiskers . Cease to be a daughter ; go and be a wife ! "
208382	208443	207806	207806	He	3916	" Red whiskers ! I wonder what you mean , papa . You should take care of prejudice . You sometimes say to me that all the Scotch , your countrymen , are the victims of prejudice . It is proved now , I think , when no distinction is to be made between red and deep nut - brown . "
208444	208454	208455	208455	She	3919	" Leave the prejudiced old Scotchman ; go away . "
208541	208568	208570	208570	her	3919	" I wo n't leave you , papa ; I 'll never leave you . I wo n't pain you ! I 'll never pain you ! "
208573	208580	208582	208586	the loving though rugged sire	3922	" My lamb ! my treasure ! "
208687	208693	208682	208682	his	3927	" Lucy , come here . "
208734	208745	208746	208746	he	3927	" M. de Bassompierre is there - is he not ? "
208754	208757	208746	208746	he	3927	" Yes . "
208758	208769	208804	208805	Mr. Home	134	" He noticed me at dinner ? He understood me ? "
208770	208775	208804	208805	Mr. Home	134	" Yes , Graham . "
208776	208791	208746	208746	he	3927	" I am brought up for judgment , then , and so is she ? "
208792	208795	208804	208805	Mr. Home	134	" Mr. Home "
208808	208815	208804	208805	Mr. Home	134	" is talking to his daughter . "
208816	208826	208827	208827	He	3927	" Ha ! These are sharp moments , Lucy ! "
208880	208888	208875	208875	his	3927	" Is he very angry , Lucy ? "
208889	208897	208840	208840	I	0	" She is very faithful , Graham . "
208898	208906	208875	208875	his	3927	" What will be done unto me ? "
208907	208916	208875	208875	his	3927	" Graham , your star must be fortunate . "
208917	208977	208840	208840	I	0	" Must it ? Kind prophet ! So cheered , I should be a faint heart indeed to quail . I think I find all women faithful , Lucy . I ought to love them , and I do . My mother is good ; she is divine ; and you are true as steel . Are you not ? "
208978	208983	208840	208840	I	0	" Yes , Graham . "
208984	209029	209030	209030	He	3931	" Then give me thy hand , my little god - sister : it is a friendly little hand to me , and always has been . And now for the great venture . God be with the right . Lucy , say Amen ! "
209038	209041	209036	209036	I	0	" Amen ! "
209088	209092	209093	209093	he	3931	" Follow me ! "
209106	209109	209110	209110	he	3931	" Sir , "
209113	209119	209110	209110	he	3931	" what is my sentence ? "
209133	209138	209140	209141	Mr. Home	134	" Well , Bretton , "
209143	209220	209140	209141	Mr. Home	134	" you have given me the usual reward of hospitality . I entertained you ; you have taken my best . I was always glad to see you ; you were glad to see the one precious thing I had . You spoke me fair ; and , meantime , I will not say you robbed me , but I am bereaved , and what I have lost , you , it seems , have won . "
209221	209229	209110	209110	he	3931	" Sir , I can not repent . "
209230	209310	209140	209141	Mr. Home	134	" Repent ! Not you ! You triumph , no doubt : John Graham , you descended partly from a Highlander and a chief , and there is a trace of the Celt in all you look , speak , and think . You have his cunning and his charm . The red - Well then , Polly , the fair hair , the tongue of guile , and brain of wile , are all come down by inheritance . "
209311	209319	209321	209321	Graham	135	" Sir , I feel honest enough , "
209338	209342	209343	209343	he	135	" And yet , "
209346	209413	209343	209343	he	135	" I wo n't deny that in some respects you accuse me justly . In your presence I have always had a thought which I dared not show you . I did truly regard you as the possessor of the most valuable thing the world owns for me . I wished for it : I tried for it . Sir , I ask for it now . "
209414	209421	209343	209343	he	135	" John , you ask much . "
209422	209453	209343	209343	he	135	" Very much , sir . It must come from your generosity , as a gift ; from your justice , as a reward . I can never earn it . "
209454	209463	209465	209466	Mr. Home	134	" Ay ! Listen to the Highland tongue ! "
209468	209485	209486	209486	She	3935	" Look up , Polly ! Answer this ' braw wooer ; ' send him away ! "
209508	209516	209518	209518	she	3935	" Papa , I love you both , "
209520	209547	209548	209548	she	3935	" I can take care of you both . I need not send Graham away - he can live here ; he will be no inconvenience , "
209574	209584	209570	209570	They	3939	" He will be a prodigious inconvenience to me , "
209590	209615	209570	209570	They	3939	" I do n't want him , Polly , he is too tall ; he is in my way . Tell him to march . "
209616	209659	209548	209548	she	3935	" You will get used to him , papa . He seemed exceedingly tall to me at first - like a tower when I looked up at him ; but , on the whole , I would rather not have him otherwise . "
209660	209703	209548	209548	she	3935	" I object to him altogether , Polly ; I can do without a son - in - law . I should never have requested the best man in the land to stand to me in that relation . Dismiss this gentleman . "
209704	209721	209570	209570	They	3939	" But he has known you so long , papa , and suits you so well . "
209722	209765	209548	209548	she	3935	" Suits me , forsooth ! Yes ; he has pretended to make my opinions and tastes his own . He has humoured me for good reasons . I think , Polly , you and I will bid him good - by . "
209766	209780	209548	209548	she	3935	" Till to - morrow only . Shake hands with Graham , papa . "
209781	209804	209570	209570	They	3939	" No : I think not : I am not friends with him . Do n't think to coax me between you . "
209805	209883	209548	209548	she	3935	" Indeed , indeed , you are friends . Graham , stretch out your right hand . Papa , put out yours . Now , let them touch . Papa , do n't be stiff ; close your fingers ; be pliant - there ! But that is not a clasp - it is a grasp ? Papa , you grasp like a vice . You crush Graham 's hand to the bone ; you hurt him ! "
209931	209939	209943	209944	Mr. Home	134	" Come with me into my study , "
210068	210072	210073	210073	he	178	" Take her , "
210076	210095	210073	210073	he	178	" Take her , John Bretton : and may God deal with you as you deal with her ! "
210348	210351	210353	210353	she	141	" Now , "
210355	210383	210353	210353	she	141	" there is an amulet made , which has virtue to keep you two always friends . You can never quarrel so long as I wear this . "
210435	210446	210447	210447	I	0	" Is there , indeed , such happiness on earth ? "
210960	210974	210954	210954	Jacob	154	" blessings of Heaven above , blessings of the deep that lies under . "
211167	211176	211163	211163	His	135	" word is tried , whose way perfect : "
211183	211196	211163	211163	His	135	" who gives the shield of salvation , whose gentleness makes great ; "
211204	211212	211163	211163	His	135	" dwells in the height of Heaven ; "
211262	211277	211303	211304	the master	3987	" Art thou not from everlasting mine Holy One ? WE SHALL NOT DIE ! "
211490	211501	211487	211487	she	190	" This morning there will be no lesson of literature . "
211517	211561	211506	211506	her	190	" It is probable the lessons will be suspended for a week . I shall require at least that space of time to find an efficient substitute for M. Emanuel . Meanwhile , it shall be our study to fill the blanks usefully . "
211567	211572	211506	211506	her	190	" she went on , "
211662	212106	212107	212107	Emanuel	196	" She bent her head courteously , drew closer the folds of her shawl , and passed from the classe . A great silence fell : then a murmur went round the room : I believe some pupils wept . Some time elapsed . The noise , the whispering , the occasional sobbing increased . I became conscious of a relaxation of discipline , a sort of growing disorder , as if my girls felt that vigilance was withdrawn , and that surveillance had virtually left the classe . Habit and the sense of duty enabled me to rally quickly , to rise in my usual way , to speak in my usual tone , to enjoin , and finally to establish quiet . I made the English reading long and close . I kept them at it the whole morning . I remember feeling a sentiment of impatience towards the pupils who sobbed . Indeed , their emotion was not of much value : it was only an hysteric agitation . I told them so unsparingly . I half ridiculed them . I was severe . The truth was , I could not do with their tears , or that gasping sound ; I could not bear it . A rather weak- minded , low - spirited pupil kept it up when the others had done ; relentless necessity obliged and assisted me so to accost her , that she dared not carry on the demonstration , that she was forced to conquer the convulsion . That girl would have had a right to hate me , except that , when school was over and her companions departing , I ordered her to stay , and when they were gone , I did what I had never done to one among them before - pressed her to my heart and kissed her cheek . But , this impulse yielded to , I speedily put her out of the classe , for , upon that poignant strain , she wept more bitterly than ever . I filled with occupation every minute of that day , and should have liked to sit up all night if I might have kept a candle burning ; the night , however , proved a bad time , and left bad effects , preparing me ill for the next day 's ordeal of insufferable gossip . Of course this news fell under general discussion . Some little reserve had accompanied the first surprise : that soon wore off ; every mouth opened ; every tongue wagged ; teachers , pupils , the very servants , mouthed the name of "
212109	212234	212107	212107	Emanuel	196	" He , whose connection with the school was contemporary with its commencement , thus suddenly to withdraw ! All felt it strange . They talked so much , so long , so often , that , out of the very multitude of their words and rumours , grew at last some intelligence . About the third day I heard it said that he was to sail in a week ; then - that he was bound for the West Indies . I looked at Madame Beck 's face , and into her eyes , for disproof or confirmation of this report ; I perused her all over for information , but no part of her disclosed more than what was unperturbed and commonplace . "
212244	212248	212249	212249	She	3994	" she alleged . "
212300	212324	212290	212291	M. Paul	196	" She said all this in public , in classe , at the dinner - table , speaking audibly to Zelie St. Pierre . "
212331	212370	212290	212291	M. Paul	196	" I could have asked her that . I had impulses to take hold of her suddenly , as she calmly passed me in classe , to stretch out my hand and grasp her fast , and say , "
212393	212541	212542	212542	Basseterre	457	" But Madame always addressed some other teacher , and never looked at me , never seemed conscious I could have a care in the question . The week wore on . Nothing more was said about M. Emanuel coming to bid us good - by ; and none seemed anxious for his coming ; none questioned whether or not he would come ; none betrayed torment lest he should depart silent and unseen ; incessantly did they talk , and never , in all their talk , touched on this vital point . As to Madame , she of course could see him , and say to him as much as she pleased . What should she care whether or not he appeared in the schoolroom ? The week consumed . We were told that he was going on such a day , that his destination was "
212546	212569	212542	212542	Basseterre	457	" the business which called him abroad related to a friend 's interests , not his own : I thought as much . "
212574	212604	212605	212605	Basseterre	457	" I had little sleep about this time , but whenever I did slumber , it followed infallibly that I was quickly roused with a start , while the words "
212607	212608	212605	212605	Basseterre	457	" "
212611	212852	212605	212605	Basseterre	457	" seemed pronounced over my pillow , or ran athwart the darkness round and before me , in zigzag characters of red or violet light . For what I felt there was no help , and how could I help feeling ? M. Emanuel had been very kind to me of late days ; he had been growing hourly better and kinder . It was now a month since we had settled the theological difference , and in all that time there had been no quarrel . Nor had our peace been the cold daughter of divorce ; we had not lived aloof ; he had come oftener , he had talked with me more than before ; he had spent hours with me , with temper soothed , with eye content , with manner home - like and mild . Kind subjects of conversation had grown between us ; he had inquired into my plans of life , and I had communicated them ; the school project pleased him ; he made me repeat it more than once , though he called it an Alnaschar dream . The jar was over ; the mutual understanding was settling and fixing ; feelings of union and hope made themselves profoundly felt in the heart ; affection and deep esteem and dawning trust had each fastened its bond . What quiet lessons I had about this time ! No more taunts on my "
212855	212936	212605	212605	Basseterre	457	" no more menaces of grating public shows ! How sweetly , for the jealous gibe , and the more jealous , half - passionate eulogy , were substituted a mute , indulgent help , a fond guidance , and a tender forbearance which forgave but never praised . There were times when he would sit for many minutes and not speak at all ; and when dusk or duty brought separation , he would leave with words like these , "
212951	212991	212605	212605	Basseterre	457	" One evening , not ten short days since , he joined me whilst walking in my alley . He took my hand . I looked up in his face . I thought he meant to arrest my attention . "
212996	213002	212605	212605	Basseterre	457	" said he , softly ; "
213006	213942	212605	212605	Basseterre	457	" But through his touch , and with his words , a new feeling and a strange thought found a course . Could it be that he was becoming more than friend or brother ? Did his look speak a kindness beyond fraternity or amity ? His eloquent look had more to say , his hand drew me forward , his interpreting lips stirred . No . Not now . Here into the twilight alley broke an interruption : it came dual and ominous : we faced two bodeful forms - a woman 's and a priest 's - Madame Beck and Pere Silas . The aspect of the latter I shall never forget . On the first impulse it expressed a Jean - Jacques sensibility , stirred by the signs of affection just surprised ; then , immediately , darkened over it the jaundice of ecclesiastical jealousy . He spoke to me with unction . He looked on his pupil with sternness . As to Madame Beck , she , of course , saw nothing - nothing ; though her kinsman retained in her presence the hand of the heretic foreigner , not suffering withdrawal , but clasping it close and fast . Following these incidents , that sudden announcement of departure had struck me at first as incredible . Indeed , it was only frequent repetition , and the credence of the hundred and fifty minds round me , which forced on me its full acceptance . As to that week of suspense , with its blank , yet burning days , which brought from him no word of explanation - I remember , but I can not describe its passage . The last day broke . Now would he visit us . Now he would come and speak his farewell , or he would vanish mute , and be seen by us nevermore . This alternative seemed to be present in the mind of not a living creature in that school . All rose at the usual hour ; all breakfasted as usual ; all , without reference to , or apparent thought of their late Professor , betook themselves with wonted phlegm to their ordinary duties . So oblivious was the house , so tame , so trained its proceedings , so inexpectant its aspect - I scarce knew how to breathe in an atmosphere thus stagnant , thus smothering . Would no one lend me a voice ? Had no one a wish , no one a word , no one a prayer to which I could say - Amen ? I had seen them unanimous in demand for the merest trifle - a treat , a holiday , a lesson 's remission ; they could not , they would not now band to besiege Madame Beck , and insist on a last interview with a Master who had certainly been loved , at least by some - loved as they could love - but , oh ! what is the love of the multitude ? I knew where he lived : I knew where he was to be heard of , or communicated with ; the distance was scarce a stone's - throw : had it been in the next room - unsummoned , I could make no use of my knowledge . To follow , to seek out , to remind , to recall - for these things I had no faculty . M. Emanuel might have passed within reach of my arm : had he passed silent and unnoticing , silent and stirless should I have suffered him to go by . Morning wasted . Afternoon came , and I thought all was over . My heart trembled in its place . My blood was troubled in its current . I was quite sick , and hardly knew how to keep at my post - or do my work . Yet the little world round me plodded on indifferent ; all seemed jocund , free of care , or fear , or thought : the very pupils who , seven days since , had wept hysterically at a startling piece of news , appeared quite to have forgotten the news , its import , and their emotion . A little before five o'clock , the hour of dismissal , Madame Beck sent for me to her chamber , to read over and translate some English letter she had received , and to write for her the answer . Before settling to this work , I observed that she softly closed the two doors of her chamber ; she even shut and fastened the casement , though it was a hot day , and free circulation of air was usually regarded by her as indispensable . Why this precaution ? A keen suspicion , an almost fierce distrust , suggested such question . Did she want to exclude sound ? what sound ? I listened as I had never listened before ; I listened like the evening and winter - wolf , snuffing the snow , scenting prey , and hearing far off the traveller 's tramp . Yet I could both listen and write . About the middle of the letter I heard - what checked my pen - a tread in the vestibule . No door - bell had rung ; Rosine - acting doubtless by orders - had anticipated such reveillee . Madame saw me halt . She coughed , made a bustle , spoke louder . The tread had passed on to the classes . "
213945	214002	214003	214003	They	3997	" said Madame ; but my hand was fettered , my ear enchained , my thoughts were carried off captive . The classes formed another building ; the hall parted them from the dwelling - house : despite distance and partition , I heard the sudden stir of numbers , a whole division rising at once . "
214009	214036	214003	214003	They	3997	" said Madame . It was indeed the hour to put away work , but why that sudden hush - that instant quell of the tumult ? "
214048	214095	214041	214041	I	0	" And I put down my pen and left her . Left her ? No : she would not be left : powerless to detain me , she rose and followed , close as my shadow . I turned on the last step of the stair . "
214102	214106	214097	214097	you	190	" I asked . "
214109	214593	214097	214097	you	190	" said she ; meeting my glance with a peculiar aspect - a look , clouded , yet resolute . We proceeded then , not together , but she walked in my steps . He was come . Entering the first classe , I saw him . There , once more appeared the form most familiar . I doubt not they had tried to keep him away , but he was come . The girls stood in a semicircle ; he was passing round , giving his farewells , pressing each hand , touching with his lips each cheek . This last ceremony , foreign custom permitted at such a parting - so solemn , to last so long . I felt it hard that Madame Beck should dog me thus ; following and watching me close ; my neck and shoulder shrunk in fever under her breath ; I became terribly goaded . He was approaching ; the semicircle was almost travelled round ; he came to the last pupil ; he turned . But Madame was before me ; she had stepped out suddenly ; she seemed to magnify her proportions and amplify her drapery ; she eclipsed me ; I was hid . She knew my weakness and deficiency ; she could calculate the degree of moral paralysis - the total default of self - assertion - with which , in a crisis , I could be struck . She hastened to her kinsman , she broke upon him volubly , she mastered his attention , she hurried him to the door - the glass - door opening on the garden . I think he looked round ; could I but have caught his eye , courage , I think , would have rushed in to aid feeling , and there would have been a charge , and , perhaps , a rescue ; but already the room was all confusion , the semicircle broken into groups , my figure was lost among thirty more conspicuous . Madame had her will ; yes , she got him away , and he had not seen me ; he thought me absent . Five o'clock struck , the loud dismissal - bell rang , the school separated , the room emptied . There seems , to my memory , an entire darkness and distraction in some certain minutes I then passed alone - a grief inexpressible over a loss unendurable . What should I do ; oh ! what should I do ; when all my life 's hope was thus torn by the roots out of my riven , outraged heart ? What I should have done , I know not , when a little child - the least child in the school - broke with its simplicity and its unconsciousness into the raging yet silent centre of that inward conflict . "
214596	214602	214097	214097	you	190	" lisped the treble voice , "
214641	214675	214632	214632	I	0	" And the child delivered a note ; the little dove dropped on my knee , its olive leaf plucked off . I found neither address nor name , only these words : - "
214779	214780	214777	214777	PAUL	196	" "
214784	215489	214777	214777	PAUL	196	" Then it must be this evening : was he not to go on the morrow ? Yes ; of that point I was certain . I had seen the date of his vessel 's departure advertised . Oh ! I would be ready , but could that longed - for meeting really be achieved ? the time was so short , the schemers seemed so watchful , so active , so hostile ; the way of access appeared strait as a gully , deep as a chasm - Apollyon straddled across it , breathing flames . Could my Greatheart overcome ? Could my guide reach me ? Who might tell ? Yet I began to take some courage , some comfort ; it seemed to me that I felt a pulse of his heart beating yet true to the whole throb of mine . I waited my champion . Apollyon came trailing his Hell behind him . I think if Eternity held torment , its form would not be fiery rack , nor its nature despair . I think that on a certain day amongst those days which never dawned , and will not set , an angel entered Hades - stood , shone , smiled , delivered a prophecy of conditional pardon , kindled a doubtful hope of bliss to come , not now , but at a day and hour unlooked for , revealed in his own glory and grandeur the height and compass of his promise : spoke thus - then towering , became a star , and vanished into his own Heaven . His legacy was suspense - a worse boon than despair . All that evening I waited , trusting in the dove - sent olive - leaf , yet in the midst of my trust , terribly fearing . My fear pressed heavy . Cold and peculiar , I knew it for the partner of a rarely - belied presentiment . The first hours seemed long and slow ; in spirit I clung to the flying skirts of the last . They passed like drift cloud - like the wrack scudding before a storm . They passed . All the long , hot summer day burned away like a Yule - log ; the crimson of its close perished ; I was left bent among the cool blue shades , over the pale and ashen gleams of its night . Prayers were over ; it was bed - time ; my co - inmates were all retired . I still remained in the gloomy first classe , forgetting , or at least disregarding , rules I had never forgotten or disregarded before . How long I paced that classe I can not tell ; I must have been afoot many hours ; mechanically had I moved aside benches and desks , and had made for myself a path down its length . There I walked , and there , when certain that the whole household were abed , and quite out of hearing - there , I at last wept . Reliant on Night , confiding in Solitude , I kept my tears sealed , my sobs chained , no longer ; they heaved my heart ; they tore their way . In this house , what grief could be sacred ? Soon after eleven o'clock - a very late hour in the Rue Fossette - the door unclosed , quietly but not stealthily ; a lamp 's flame invaded the moonlight ; Madame Beck entered , with the same composed air , as if coming on an ordinary occasion , at an ordinary season . Instead of at once addressing me , she went to her desk , took her keys , and seemed to seek something : she loitered over this feigned search long , too long . She was calm , too calm ; my mood scarce endured the pretence ; driven beyond common range , two hours since I had left behind me wonted respects and fears . Led by a touch , and ruled by a word , under usual circumstances , no yoke could now be borne - no curb obeyed . "
215498	215502	215544	215544	me	0	" said Madame ; "
215515	215542	215544	215544	me	0	" Madame met no answer : I did not check my walk ; when she came in my way , I put her out of it . "
215560	215569	215553	215553	me	0	" said she , trying to speak softly . "
215572	215576	215578	215578	you	0	" I said ; "
215587	215588	215589	215589	Your	4003	" "
215614	215615	215607	215607	she	276	" "
215618	215623	215616	215616	Madame	190	" I broke out , "
215716	215717	215713	215713	I	0	" "
215733	215734	215731	215731	Goton	276	" "
215777	215778	215774	215774	you	190	" "
215797	215798	215792	215792	He	196	" "
215804	215825	215799	215802	Dog in the manger	4010	" I said : for I knew she secretly wanted him , and had always wanted him . She called him "
215828	215835	215799	215802	Dog in the manger	4010	" she railed at him for a "
215838	216038	215799	215802	Dog in the manger	4010	" she did not love , but she wanted to marry , that she might bind him to her interest . Deep into some of Madame 's secrets I had entered - I know not how : by an intuition or an inspiration which came to me - I know not whence . In the course of living with her too , I had slowly learned , that , unless with an inferior , she must ever be a rival . She was my rival , heart and soul , though secretly , under the smoothest bearing , and utterly unknown to all save her and myself . Two minutes I stood over Madame , feeling that the whole woman was in my power , because in some moods , such as the present - in some stimulated states of perception , like that of this instant - her habitual disguise , her mask and her domino , were to me a mere network reticulated with holes ; and I saw underneath a being heartless , self- indulgent , and ignoble . She quietly retreated from me : meek and self- possessed , though very uneasy , she said , "
216055	216337	216049	216049	she	4011	" Which she did incontinent , perhaps even more glad to get away , than I was to see her vanish . This was the sole flash - eliciting , truth - extorting , rencontre which ever occurred between me and Madame Beck : this short night - scene was never repeated . It did not one whit change her manner to me . I do not know that she revenged it . I do not know that she hated me the worse for my fell candour . I think she bucklered herself with the secret philosophy of her strong mind , and resolved to forget what it irked her to remember . I know that to the end of our mutual lives there occurred no repetition of , no allusion to , that fiery passage . That night passed : all nights - even the starless night before dissolution - must wear away . About six o'clock , the hour which called up the household , I went out to the court , and washed my face in its cold , fresh well - water . Entering by the carre , a piece of mirror- glass , set in an oaken cabinet , repeated my image . It said I was changed : my cheeks and lips were sodden white , my eyes were glassy , and my eyelids swollen and purple . On rejoining my companions , I knew they all looked at me - my heart seemed discovered to them : I believed myself self - betrayed . Hideously certain did it seem that the very youngest of the school must guess why and for whom I despaired . "
216340	216362	216338	216338	Isabelle	221	" the child whom I had once nursed in sickness , approached me . Would she , too , mock me ! "
216376	216607	216374	216374	Mademoiselle	261	" said she , putting her finger in her mouth , and staring with a wistful stupidity which at the moment seemed to me more beautiful than the keenest intelligence . Isabelle did not long stand alone in the recommendation of ignorance : before the day was over , I gathered cause of gratitude towards the whole blind household . The multitude have something else to do than to read hearts and interpret dark sayings . Who wills , may keep his own counsel - be his own secret 's sovereign . In the course of that day , proof met me on proof , not only that the cause of my present sorrow was unguessed , but that my whole inner life for the last six months , was still mine only . It was not known - it had not been noted - that I held in peculiar value one life among all lives . Gossip had passed me by ; curiosity had looked me over ; both subtle influences , hovering always round , had never become centred upon me . A given organization may live in a full fever - hospital , and escape typhus . M. Emanuel had come and gone : I had been taught and sought ; in season and out of season he had called me , and I had obeyed him : "
216613	216615	216609	216609	Paul	196	" - "
216622	216791	216620	216621	M. Paul	196	" - such had been the perpetual bulletin ; and nobody commented , far less condemned . Nobody hinted , nobody jested . Madame Beck read the riddle : none else resolved it . What I now suffered was called illness - a headache : I accepted the baptism . But what bodily illness was ever like this pain ? This certainty that he was gone without a farewell - this cruel conviction that fate and pursuing furies - a woman 's envy and a priest 's bigotry - would suffer me to see him no more ? What wonder that the second evening found me like the first - untamed , tortured , again pacing a solitary room in an unalterable passion of silent desolation ? Madame Beck did not herself summon me to bed that night - she did not come near me : she sent Ginevra Fanshawe - a more efficient agent for the purpose she could not have employed . Ginevra 's first words - "
216801	216939	216940	216940	Madame	190	" for Ginevra , like the rest , thought I had a headache - an intolerable headache which made me frightfully white in the face , and insanely restless in the foot - her first words , I say , inspired the impulse to flee anywhere , so that it were only out of reach . And soon , what followed - plaints about her own headaches - completed the business . I went up - stairs . Presently I was in my bed - my miserable bed - haunted with quick scorpions . I had not been laid down five minutes , when another emissary arrived : Goton came , bringing me something to drink . I was consumed with thirst - I drank eagerly ; the beverage was sweet , but I tasted a drug . "
216952	217130	216940	216940	Madame	190	" said Goton , as she received back the emptied cup . Ah ! the sedative had been administered . In fact , they had given me a strong opiate . I was to be held quiet for one night . The household came to bed , the night - light was lit , the dormitory hushed . Sleep soon reigned : over those pillows , sleep won an easy supremacy : contented sovereign over heads and hearts which did not ache - he passed by the unquiet . The drug wrought . I know not whether Madame had overcharged or under- charged the dose ; its result was not that she intended . Instead of stupor , came excitement . I became alive to new thought - to reverie peculiar in colouring . A gathering call ran among the faculties , their bugles sang , their trumpets rang an untimely summons . Imagination was roused from her rest , and she came forth impetuous and venturous . With scorn she looked on Matter , her mate - "
217133	217137	217138	217138	Sluggard	463	" she said . "
217153	217154	217150	217150	thou	4014	" "
217162	219921	219922	219922	Mademoiselle	261	" was her cry ; and when I lifted the heavy blind from the casement close at hand - with her own royal gesture , she showed me a moon supreme , in an element deep and splendid . To my gasping senses she made the glimmering gloom , the narrow limits , the oppressive heat of the dormitory , intolerable . She lured me to leave this den and follow her forth into dew , coolness , and glory . She brought upon me a strange vision of Villette at midnight . Especially she showed the park , the summer - park , with its long alleys all silent , lone and safe ; among these lay a huge stone basin - that basin I knew , and beside which I had often stood - deep - set in the tree - shadows , brimming with cool water , clear , with a green , leafy , rushy bed . What of all this ? The park - gates were shut up , locked , sentinelled : the place could not be entered . Could it not ? A point worth considering ; and while revolving it , I mechanically dressed . Utterly incapable of sleeping or lying still - excited from head to foot - what could I do better than dress ? The gates were locked , soldiers set before them : was there , then , no admission to the park ? The other day , in walking past , I had seen , without then attending to the circumstance , a gap in the paling - one stake broken down : I now saw this gap again in recollection - saw it very plainly - the narrow , irregular aperture visible between the stems of the lindens , planted orderly as a colonnade . A man could not have made his way through that aperture , nor could a stout woman , perhaps not Madame Beck ; but I thought I might : I fancied I should like to try , and once within , at this hour the whole park would be mine - the moonlight , midnight park ! How soundly the dormitory slept ! What deep slumbers ! What quiet breathing ! How very still the whole large house ! What was the time ? I felt restless to know . There stood a clock in the classe below : what hindered me from venturing down to consult it ? By such a moon , its large white face and jet black figures must be vividly distinct . As for hindrance to this step , there offered not so much as a creaking hinge or a clicking latch . On these hot July nights , close air could not be tolerated , and the chamber - door stood wide open . Will the dormitory - planks sustain my tread untraitorous ? Yes . I know wherever a board is loose , and will avoid it . The oak staircase creaks somewhat as I descend , but not much : - I am in the carre . The great classe - doors are close shut : they are bolted . On the other hand , the entrance to the corridor stands open . The classes seem to my thought , great dreary jails , buried far back beyond thoroughfares , and for me , filled with spectral and intolerable Memories , laid miserable amongst their straw and their manacles . The corridor offers a cheerful vista , leading to the high vestibule which opens direct upon the street . Hush ! - the clock strikes . Ghostly deep as is the stillness of this convent , it is only eleven . While my ear follows to silence the hum of the last stroke , I catch faintly from the built - out capital , a sound like bells or like a band - a sound where sweetness , where victory , where mourning blend . Oh , to approach this music nearer , to listen to it alone by the rushy basin ! Let me go - oh , let me go ! What hinders , what does not aid freedom ? There , in the corridor , hangs my garden - costume , my large hat , my shawl . There is no lock on the huge , heavy , porte - cochere ; there is no key to seek : it fastens with a sort of spring - bolt , not to be opened from the outside , but which , from within , may be noiselessly withdrawn . Can I manage it ? It yields to my hand , yields with propitious facility . I wonder as that portal seems almost spontaneously to unclose - I wonder as I cross the threshold and step on the paved street , wonder at the strange ease with which this prison has been forced . It seems as if I had been pioneered invisibly , as if some dissolving force had gone before me : for myself , I have scarce made an effort . Quiet Rue Fossette ! I find on this pavement that wanderer - wooing summer night of which I mused ; I see its moon over me ; I feel its dew in the air . But here I can not stay ; I am still too near old haunts : so close under the dungeon , I can hear the prisoners moan . This solemn peace is not what I seek , it is not what I can bear : to me the face of that sky bears the aspect of a world 's death . The park also will be calm - I know , a mortal serenity prevails everywhere - yet let me seek the park . I took a route well known , and went up towards the palatial and royal Haute - Ville ; thence the music I had heard certainly floated ; it was hushed now , but it might re - waken . I went on : neither band nor bell music came to meet me ; another sound replaced it , a sound like a strong tide , a great flow , deepening as I proceeded . Light broke , movement gathered , chimes pealed - to what was I coming ? Entering on the level of a Grande Place , I found myself , with the suddenness of magic , plunged amidst a gay , living , joyous crowd . Villette is one blaze , one broad illumination ; the whole world seems abroad ; moonlight and heaven are banished : the town , by her own flambeaux , beholds her own splendour - gay dresses , grand equipages , fine horses and gallant riders throng the bright streets . I see even scores of masks . It is a strange scene , stranger than dreams . But where is the park ? - I ought to be near it . In the midst of this glare the park must be shadowy and calm - there , at least , are neither torches , lamps , nor crowd ? I was asking this question when an open carriage passed me filled with known faces . Through the deep throng it could pass but slowly ; the spirited horses fretted in their curbed ardour . I saw the occupants of that carriage well : me they could not see , or , at least , not know , folded close in my large shawl , screened with my straw hat in that motley crowd no dress was noticeably strange . I saw the Count de Bassompierre ; I saw my godmother , handsomely apparelled , comely and cheerful ; I saw , too , Paulina Mary , compassed with the triple halo of her beauty , her youth , and her happiness . In looking on her countenance of joy , and eyes of festal light , one scarce remembered to note the gala elegance of what she wore ; I know only that the drapery floating about her was all white and light and bridal ; seated opposite to her I saw Graham Bretton ; it was in looking up at him her aspect had caught its lustre - the light repeated in her eyes beamed first out of his . It gave me strange pleasure to follow these friends viewlessly , and I did follow them , as I thought , to the park . I watched them alight carriages were inadmissible amidst new and unanticipated splendours . Lo ! the iron gateway , between the stone columns , was spanned by a flaming arch built of massed stars ; and , following them cautiously beneath that arch , where were they , and where was I ? In a land of enchantment , a garden most gorgeous , a plain sprinkled with coloured meteors , a forest with sparks of purple and ruby and golden fire gemming the foliage ; a region , not of trees and shadow , but of strangest architectural wealth - of altar and of temple , of pyramid , obelisk , and sphinx : incredible to say , the wonders and the symbols of Egypt teemed throughout the park of Villette . No matter that in five minutes the secret was mine - the key of the mystery picked up , and its illusion unveiled - no matter that I quickly recognised the material of these solemn fragments - the timber , the paint , and the pasteboard - these inevitable discoveries failed to quite destroy the charm , or undermine the marvel of that night . No matter that I now seized the explanation of the whole great fete - a fete of which the conventual Rue Fossette had not tasted , though it had opened at dawn that morning , and was still in full vigour near midnight . In past days there had been , said history , an awful crisis in the fate of Labassecour , involving I know not what peril to the rights and liberties of her gallant citizens . Rumours of wars there had been , if not wars themselves ; a kind of struggling in the streets - a bustle - a running to and fro , some rearing of barricades , some burgher - rioting , some calling out of troops , much interchange of brickbats , and even a little of shot . Tradition held that patriots had fallen : in the old Basse - Ville was shown an enclosure , solemnly built in and set apart , holding , it was said , the sacred bones of martyrs . Be this as it may , a certain day in the year was still kept as a festival in honour of the said patriots and martyrs of somewhat apocryphal memory - the morning being given to a solemn Te Deum in St. Jean Baptiste , the evening devoted to spectacles , decorations , and illuminations , such as these I now saw . While looking up at the image of a white ibis , fixed on a column - while fathoming the deep , torch - lit perspective of an avenue , at the close of which was couched a sphinx - I lost sight of the party which , from the middle of the great square , I had followed - or , rather , they vanished like a group of apparitions . On this whole scene was impressed a dream - like character : every shape was wavering , every movement floating , every voice echo - like - half - mocking , half- uncertain . Paulina and her friends being gone , I scarce could avouch that I had really seen them ; nor did I miss them as guides through the chaos , far less regret them as protectors amidst the night . That festal night would have been safe for a very child . Half the peasantry had come in from the outlying environs of Villette , and the decent burghers were all abroad and around , dressed in their best . My straw - hat passed amidst cap and jacket , short petticoat , and long calico mantle , without , perhaps , attracting a glance ; I only took the precaution to bind down the broad leaf gipsy - wise , with a supplementary ribbon - and then I felt safe as if masked . Safe I passed down the avenues - safe I mixed with the crowd where it was deepest . To be still was not in my power , nor quietly to observe . I took a revel of the scene ; I drank the elastic night - air - the swell of sound , the dubious light , now flashing , now fading . As to Happiness or Hope , they and I had shaken hands , but just now - I scorned Despair . My vague aim , as I went , was to find the stone - basin , with its clear depth and green lining : of that coolness and verdure I thought , with the passionate thirst of unconscious fever . Amidst the glare , and hurry , and throng , and noise , I still secretly and chiefly longed to come on that circular mirror of crystal , and surprise the moon glassing therein her pearly front . I knew my route , yet it seemed as if I was hindered from pursuing it direct : now a sight , and now a sound , called me aside , luring me down this alley and down that . Already I saw the thick - planted trees which framed this tremulous and rippled glass , when , choiring out of a glade to the right , broke such a sound as I thought might be heard if Heaven were to open - such a sound , perhaps , as was heard above the plain of Bethlehem , on the night of glad tidings . The song , the sweet music , rose afar , but rushing swiftly on fast- strengthening pinions - there swept through these shades so full a storm of harmonies that , had no tree been near against which to lean , I think I must have dropped . Voices were there , it seemed to me , unnumbered ; instruments varied and countless - bugle , horn , and trumpet I knew . The effect was as a sea breaking into song with all its waves . The swaying tide swept this way , and then it fell back , and I followed its retreat . It led me towards a Byzantine building - a sort of kiosk near the park 's centre . Round about stood crowded thousands , gathered to a grand concert in the open air . What I had heard was , I think , a wild Jaeger chorus ; the night , the space , the scene , and my own mood , had but enhanced the sounds and their impression . Here were assembled ladies , looking by this light most beautiful : some of their dresses were gauzy , and some had the sheen of satin , the flowers and the blond trembled , and the veils waved about their decorated bonnets , as that host - like chorus , with its greatly- gathering sound , sundered the air above them . Most of these ladies occupied the little light park - chairs , and behind and beside them stood guardian gentlemen . The outer ranks of the crowd were made up of citizens , plebeians and police . In this outer rank I took my place . I rather liked to find myself the silent , unknown , consequently unaccosted neighbour of the short petticoat and the sabot ; and only the distant gazer at the silk robe , the velvet mantle , and the plumed chapeau . Amidst so much life and joy , too , it suited me to be alone - quite alone . Having neither wish nor power to force my way through a mass so close - packed , my station was on the farthest confines , where , indeed , I might hear , but could see little . "
219928	220528	220529	220529	I	0	" said a voice at my elbow . Who dared accost me , a being in a mood so little social ? I turned , rather to repel than to reply . I saw a man - a burgher - an entire stranger , as I deemed him for one moment , but the next , recognised in him a certain tradesman - a bookseller , whose shop furnished the Rue Fossette with its books and stationery ; a man notorious in our pensionnat for the excessive brittleness of his temper , and frequent snappishness of his manner , even to us , his principal customers : but whom , for my solitary self , I had ever been disposed to like , and had always found civil , sometimes kind ; once , in aiding me about some troublesome little exchange of foreign money , he had done me a service . He was an intelligent man ; under his asperity , he was a good - hearted man ; the thought had sometimes crossed me , that a part of his nature bore affinity to a part of M. Emanuel 's whom he knew well , and whom I had often seen sitting on Miret 's counter , turning over the current month 's publications ; and it was in this affinity I read the explanation of that conciliatory feeling with which I instinctively regarded him . Strange to say , this man knew me under my straw - hat and closely - folded shawl ; and , though I deprecated the effort , he insisted on making a way for me through the crowd , and finding me a better situation . He carried his disinterested civility further ; and , from some quarter , procured me a chair . Once and again , I have found that the most cross- grained are by no means the worst of mankind ; nor the humblest in station , the least polished in feeling . This man , in his courtesy , seemed to find nothing strange in my being here alone ; only a reason for extending to me , as far as he could , a retiring , yet efficient attention . Having secured me a place and a seat , he withdrew without asking a question , without obtruding a remark , without adding a superfluous word . No wonder that Professor Emanuel liked to take his cigar and his lounge , and to read his feuilleton in M. Miret 's shop - the two must have suited . I had not been seated five minutes , ere I became aware that chance and my worthy burgher friend had brought me once more within view of a familiar and domestic group . Right before me sat the Brettons and de Bassompierres . Within reach of my hand - had I chosen to extend it - sat a figure like a fairy - queen , whose array , lilies and their leaves seemed to have suggested ; whatever was not spotless white , being forest - green . My godmother , too , sat so near , that , had I leaned forward , my breath might have stirred the ribbon of her bonnet . They were too near ; having been just recognised by a comparative stranger , I felt uneasy at this close vicinage of intimate acquaintance . It made me quite start when Mrs. Bretton , turning to Mr. Home , and speaking out of a kind impulse of memory , said , - "
220560	220561	220563	220563	she	142	" "
220586	220595	220581	220581	we	4017	" rejoined the kind gentleman ; and added , "
220613	221057	220596	220596	I	0	" Dear were they both to me , dear are they to this day in their remembered benevolence . Little knew they the rack of pain which had driven Lucy almost into fever , and brought her out , guideless and reckless , urged and drugged to the brink of frenzy . I had half a mind to bend over the elders ' shoulders , and answer their goodness with the thanks of my eyes . M. de Bassompierre did not well know me , but I knew him , and honoured and admired his nature , with all its plain sincerity , its warm affection , and unconscious enthusiasm . Possibly I might have spoken , but just then Graham turned ; he turned with one of his stately firm movements , so different from those , of a sharp - tempered under - sized man : there was behind him a throng , a hundred ranks deep ; there were thousands to meet his eye and divide its scrutiny - why then did he concentrate all on me - oppressing me with the whole force of that full , blue , steadfast orb ? Why , if he would look , did not one glance satisfy him ? why did he turn on his chair , rest his elbow on its back , and study me leisurely ? He could not see my face , I held it down ; surely , he could not recognise me : I stooped , I turned , I would not be known . He rose , by some means he contrived to approach , in two minutes he would have had my secret : my identity would have been grasped between his , never tyrannous , but always powerful hands . There was but one way to evade or to check him . I implied , by a sort of supplicatory gesture , that it was my prayer to be let alone ; after that , had he persisted , he would perhaps have seen the spectacle of Lucy incensed : not all that was grand , or good , or kind in him and Lucy felt the full amount should have kept her quite tame , or absolutely inoffensive and shadowlike . He looked , but he desisted . He shook his handsome head , but he was mute . He resumed his seat , nor did he again turn or disturb me by a glance , except indeed for one single instant , when a look , rather solicitous than curious , stole my way - speaking what somehow stilled my heart like "
221066	221195	220596	220596	I	0	" Graham 's thoughts of me were not entirely those of a frozen indifference , after all . I believe in that goodly mansion , his heart , he kept one little place under the sky - lights where Lucy might have entertainment , if she chose to call . It was not so handsome as the chambers where he lodged his male friends ; it was not like the hall where he accommodated his philanthropy , or the library where he treasured his science , still less did it resemble the pavilion where his marriage feast was splendidly spread ; yet , gradually , by long and equal kindness , he proved to me that he kept one little closet , over the door of which was written "
221200	221976	220596	220596	I	0	" I kept a place for him , too - a place of which I never took the measure , either by rule or compass : I think it was like the tent of Peri - Banou . All my life long I carried it folded in the hollow of my hand yet , released from that hold and constriction , I know not but its innate capacity for expanse might have magnified it into a tabernacle for a host . Forbearing as he was to - night , I could not stay in this proximity ; this dangerous place and seat must be given up : I watched my opportunity , rose , and stole away . He might think , he might even believe that Lucy was contained within that shawl , and sheltered under that hat ; he never could be certain , for he did not see my face . Surely the spirit of restlessness was by this time appeased ? Had I not had enough of adventure ? Did I not begin to flag , quail , and wish for safety under a roof ? Not so . I still loathed my bed in the school dormitory more than words can express : I clung to whatever could distract thought . Somehow I felt , too , that the night 's drama was but begun , that the prologue was scarce spoken : throughout this woody and turfy theatre reigned a shadow of mystery ; actors and incidents unlooked - for , waited behind the scenes : I thought so foreboding told me as much . Straying at random , obeying the push of every chance elbow , I was brought to a quarter where trees planted in clusters , or towering singly , broke up somewhat the dense packing of the crowd , and gave it a more scattered character . These confines were far from the music , and somewhat aloof even from the lamps , but there was sound enough to soothe , and with that full , high moon , lamps were scarce needed . Here had chiefly settled family - groups , burgher - parents ; some of them , late as was the hour , actually surrounded by their children , with whom it had not been thought advisable to venture into the closer throng . Three fine tall trees growing close , almost twined stem within stem , lifted a thick canopy of shade above a green knoll , crowned with a seat - a seat which might have held several , yet it seemed abandoned to one , the remaining members of the fortunate party in possession of this site standing dutifully round ; yet , amongst this reverend circle was a lady , holding by the hand a little girl . When I caught sight of this little girl , she was twisting herself round on her heel , swinging from her conductress 's hand , flinging herself from side to side with wanton and fantastic gyrations . These perverse movements arrested my attention , they struck me as of a character fearfully familiar . On close inspection , no less so appeared the child 's equipment ; the lilac silk pelisse , the small swansdown boa , the white bonnet - the whole holiday toilette , in short , was the gala garb of a cherub but too well known , of that tadpole , Desiree Beck - and Desiree Beck it was - she , or an imp in her likeness . I might have taken this discovery as a thunder - clap , but such hyperbole would have been premature ; discovery was destined to rise more than one degree , ere it reached its climax . On whose hand could the amiable Desiree swing thus selfishly , whose glove could she tear thus recklessly , whose arm thus strain with impunity , or on the borders of whose dress thus turn and trample insolently , if not the hand , glove , arm , and robe of her lady - mother ? And there , in an Indian shawl and a pale - green crape bonnet - there , fresh , portly , blithe , and pleasant - there stood Madame Beck . Curious ! I had certainly deemed Madame in her bed , and Desiree in her crib , at this blessed minute , sleeping , both of them , the sleep of the just , within the sacred walls , amidst the profound seclusion of the Rue Fossette . Most certainly also they did not picture "
221979	221991	221977	221978	Meess Lucie	187	" otherwise engaged ; and here we all three were taking our "
221993	223137	223138	223138	My	0	" in the fete - blazing park at midnight ! The fact was , Madame was only acting according to her quite justifiable wo nt . I remembered now I had heard it said among the teachers - though without at the time particularly noticing the gossip - that often , when we thought Madame in her chamber , sleeping , she was gone , full - dressed , to take her pleasure at operas , or plays , or balls . Madame had no sort of taste for a monastic life , and took care - largely , though discreetly - to season her existence with a relish of the world . Half a dozen gentlemen of her friends stood about her . Amongst these , I was not slow to recognise two or three . There was her brother , M. Victor Kint ; there was another person , moustached and with long hair - a calm , taciturn man , but whose traits bore a stamp and a semblance I could not mark unmoved . Amidst reserve and phlegm , amidst contrasts of character and of countenance , something there still was which recalled a face - mobile , fervent , feeling - a face changeable , now clouded , and now alight - a face from my world taken away , for my eyes lost , but where my best spring - hours of life had alternated in shadow and in glow ; that face , where I had often seen movements so near the signs of genius - that why there did not shine fully out the undoubted fire , the thing , the spirit , and the secret itself - I could never tell . Yes - this Josef Emanuel - this man of peace - reminded me of his ardent brother . Besides Messieurs Victor and Josef , I knew another of this party . This third person stood behind and in the shade , his attitude too was stooping , yet his dress and bald white head made him the most conspicuous figure of the group . He was an ecclesiastic : he was Pere Silas . Do not fancy , reader , that there was any inconsistency in the priest 's presence at this fete . This was not considered a show of Vanity Fair , but a commemoration of patriotic sacrifice . The Church patronised it , even with ostentation . There were troops of priests in the park that night . Pere Silas stooped over the seat with its single occupant , the rustic bench and that which sat upon it : a strange mass it was - bearing no shape , yet magnificent . You saw , indeed , the outline of a face , and features , but these were so cadaverous and so strangely placed , you could almost have fancied a head severed from its trunk , and flung at random on a pile of rich merchandise . The distant lamp - rays glanced on clear pendants , on broad rings ; neither the chasteness of moonlight , nor the distance of the torches , could quite subdue the gorgeous dyes of the drapery . Hail , Madame Walravens ! I think you looked more witch- like than ever . And presently the good lady proved that she was indeed no corpse or ghost , but a harsh and hardy old woman ; for , upon some aggravation in the clamorous petition of Desiree Beck to her mother , to go to the kiosk and take sweetmeats , the hunchback suddenly fetched her a resounding rap with her gold - knobbed cane . There , then , were Madame Walravens , Madame Beck , Pere Silas - the whole conjuration , the secret junta . The sight of them thus assembled did me good . I can not say that I felt weak before them , or abashed , or dismayed . They outnumbered me , and I was worsted and under their feet ; but , as yet , I was not dead . CHAPTER XXXIX . OLD AND NEW ACQUAINTANCE . Fascinated as by a basilisk with three heads , I could not leave this clique ; the ground near them seemed to hold my feet . The canopy of entwined trees held out shadow , the night whispered a pledge of protection , and an officious lamp flashed just one beam to show me an obscure , safe seat , and then vanished . Let me now briefly tell the reader all that , during the past dark fortnight , I have been silently gathering from Rumour , respecting the origin and the object of M. Emanuel 's departure . The tale is short , and not new : its alpha is Mammon , and its omega Interest . If Madame Walravens was hideous as a Hindoo idol , she seemed also to possess , in the estimation of these her votaries , an idol 's consequence . The fact was , she had been rich - very rich ; and though , for the present , without the command of money , she was likely one day to be rich again . At Basseterre , in Guadaloupe , she possessed a large estate , received in dowry on her marriage sixty years ago , sequestered since her husband 's failure ; but now , it was supposed , cleared of claim , and , if duly looked after by a competent agent of integrity , considered capable of being made , in a few years , largely productive . Pere Silas took an interest in this prospective improvement for the sake of religion and the church , whereof Magliore Walravens was a devout daughter . Madame Beck , distantly related to the hunchback and knowing her to be without family of her own , had long brooded over contingencies with a mother 's calculating forethought , and , harshly treated as she was by Madame Walravens , never ceased to court her for interest 's sake . Madame Beck and the priest were thus , for money reasons , equally and sincerely interested in the nursing of the West Indian estate . But the distance was great , and the climate hazardous . The competent and upright agent wanted , must be a devoted man . Just such a man had Madame Walravens retained for twenty years in her service , blighting his life , and then living on him , like an old fungus ; such a man had Pere Silas trained , taught , and bound to him by the ties of gratitude , habit , and belief . Such a man Madame Beck knew , and could in some measure influence . "
223141	223146	223138	223138	My	0	" said Pere Silas , "
223167	223502	223164	223165	a heretic	3842	" Madame Beck made also her private comment , and preferred in her own breast her secret reason for desiring expatriation . The thing she could not obtain , she desired not another to win : rather would she destroy it . As to Madame Walravens , she wanted her money and her land , and knew Paul , if he liked , could make the best and faithfullest steward : so the three self - seekers banded and beset the one unselfish . They reasoned , they appealed , they implored ; on his mercy they cast themselves , into his hands they confidingly thrust their interests . They asked but two or three years of devotion - after that , he should live for himself : one of the number , perhaps , wished that in the meantime he might die . No living being ever humbly laid his advantage at M. Emanuel 's feet , or confidingly put it into his hands , that he spurned the trust or repulsed the repository . What might be his private pain or inward reluctance to leave Europe - what his calculations for his own future - none asked , or knew , or reported . All this was a blank to me . His conferences with his confessor I might guess ; the part duty and religion were made to play in the persuasions used , I might conjecture . He was gone , and had made no sign . There my knowledge closed . With my head bent , and my forehead resting on my hands , I sat amidst grouped tree - stems and branching brushwood . Whatever talk passed amongst my neighbours , I might hear , if I would ; I was near enough ; but for some time , there was scarce motive to attend . They gossiped about the dresses , the music , the illuminations , the fine night . I listened to hear them say , "
223513	223516	223675	223676	Justine Marie	429	" his ship "
223521	223592	223675	223676	Justine Marie	429	" No such remark fell ; neither the Antigua , nor her course , nor her passenger were named . Perhaps the light chat scarcely interested old Madame Walravens more than it did me ; she appeared restless , turning her head now to this side , now that , looking through the trees , and among the crowd , as if expectant of an arrival and impatient of delay . "
223604	223657	223675	223676	Justine Marie	429	" I heard her mutter more than once ; and at last , as if determined to have an answer to her question - which hitherto none seemed to mind , she spoke aloud this phrase - a phrase brief enough , simple enough , but it sent a shock through me - "
223662	223666	223675	223676	Justine Marie	429	" said she , "
223673	223674	223670	223671	Justine Marie	429	" "
223678	223780	223675	223676	Justine Marie	429	" What was this ? Justine Marie - the dead nun - where was she ? Why , in her grave , Madame Walravens - what can you want with her ? You shall go to her , but she shall not come to you . Thus I should have answered , had the response lain with me , but nobody seemed to be of my mind ; nobody seemed surprised , startled , or at a loss . The quietest commonplace answer met the strange , the dead- disturbing , the Witch - of - Endor query of the hunchback . "
223784	223788	223781	223782	Justine Marie	429	" said one , "
223804	224026	223798	223798	she	429	" Out of this question and reply sprang a change in the chat - chat it still remained , easy , desultory , familiar gossip . Hint , allusion , comment , went round the circle , but all so broken , so dependent on references to persons not named , or circumstances not defined , that listen as intently as I would - and I did listen now with a fated interest - I could make out no more than that some scheme was on foot , in which this ghostly Justine Marie - dead or alive - was concerned . This family - junta seemed grasping at her somehow , for some reason ; there seemed question of a marriage , of a fortune - for whom I could not quite make out - perhaps for Victor Kint , perhaps for Josef Emanuel - both were bachelors . Once I thought the hints and jests rained upon a young fair - haired foreigner of the party , whom they called Heinrich Muehler . Amidst all the badinage , Madame Walravens still obtruded from time to time , hoarse , cross - grained speeches ; her impatience being diverted only by an implacable surveillance of Desiree , who could not stir but the old woman menaced her with her staff . "
224030	224038	223798	223798	she	429	" suddenly cried one of the gentlemen , "
224045	224215	224216	224216	She	4024	" This moment was for me peculiar . I called up to memory the pictured nun on the panel ; present to my mind was the sad love - story ; I saw in thought the vision of the garret , the apparition of the alley , the strange birth of the berceau ; I underwent a presentiment of discovery , a strong conviction of coming disclosure . Ah ! when imagination once runs riot where do we stop ? What winter tree so bare and branchless - what way - side , hedge - munching animal so humble , that Fancy , a passing cloud , and a struggling moonbeam , will not clothe it in spirituality , and make of it a phantom ? With solemn force pressed on my heart , the expectation of mystery breaking up : hitherto I had seen this spectre only through a glass darkly ; now was I to behold it face to face . I leaned forward ; I looked . "
224219	224298	223798	223798	she	429	" cried Josef Emanuel . The circle opened as if opening to admit a new and welcome member . At this instant a torch chanced to be carried past ; its blaze aided the pale moon in doing justice to the crisis , in lighting to perfection the denouement pressing on . Surely those near me must have felt some little of the anxiety I felt , in degree so unmeted . Of that group the coolest must have "
224306	224609	223798	223798	she	429	" As for me , my life stood still . It is over . The moment and the nun are come . The crisis and the revelation are passed by . The flambeau glares still within a yard , held up in a park - keeper 's hand ; its long eager tongue of flame almost licks the figure of the Expected - there - where she stands full in my sight . What is she like ? What does she wear ? How does she look ? Who is she ? There are many masks in the park to - night , and as the hour wears late , so strange a feeling of revelry and mystery begins to spread abroad , that scarce would you discredit me , reader , were I to say that she is like the nun of the attic , that she wears black skirts and white head- clothes , that she looks the resurrection of the flesh , and that she is a risen ghost . All falsities - all figments ! We will not deal in this gear . Let us be honest , and cut , as heretofore , from the homely web of truth . Homely , though , is an ill - chosen word . What I see is not precisely homely . A girl of Villette stands there - a girl fresh from her pensionnat . She is very comely , with the beauty indigenous to this country . She looks well - nourished , fair , and fat of flesh . Her cheeks are round , her eyes good ; her hair is abundant . She is handsomely dressed . She is not alone ; her escort consists of three persons - two being elderly ; these she addresses as "
224612	224614	224615	224616	Ma Tante	473	" and "
224618	224645	224615	224616	Ma Tante	473	" She laughs , she chats ; good - humoured , buxom , and blooming , she looks , at all points , the bourgeoise belle . "
224652	225352	224615	224616	Ma Tante	473	" so much for ghosts and mystery : not that this last was solved - this girl certainly is not my nun : what I saw in the garret and garden must have been taller by a span . We have looked at the city belle ; we have cursorily glanced at the respectable old uncle and aunt . Have we a stray glance to give to the third member of this company ? Can we spare him a moment 's notice ? We ought to distinguish him so far , reader ; he has claims on us ; we do not now meet him for the first time . I clasped my hands very hard , and I drew my breath very deep : I held in the cry , I devoured the ejaculation , I forbade the start , I spoke and I stirred no more than a stone ; but I knew what I looked on ; through the dimness left in my eyes by many nights ' weeping , I knew him . They said he was to sail by the Antigua . Madame Beck said so . She lied , or she had uttered what was once truth , and failed to contradict it when it became false . The Antigua was gone , and there stood Paul Emanuel . Was I glad ? A huge load left me . Was it a fact to warrant joy ? I know not . Ask first what were the circumstances attendant on this respite ? How far did this delay concern me ? Were there not those whom it might touch more nearly ? After all , who may this young girl , this Justine Marie , be ? Not a stranger , reader ; she is known to me by sight ; she visits at the Rue Fossette : she is often of Madame Beck 's Sunday parties . She is a relation of both the Becks and Walravens ; she derives her baptismal name from the sainted nun who would have been her aunt had she lived ; her patronymic is Sauveur ; she is an heiress and an orphan , and M. Emanuel is her guardian ; some say her godfather . The family junta wish this heiress to be married to one of their band - which is it ? Vital question - which is it ? I felt very glad now , that the drug administered in the sweet draught had filled me with a possession which made bed and chamber intolerable . I always , through my whole life , liked to penetrate to the real truth ; I like seeking the goddess in her temple , and handling the veil , and daring the dread glance . O Titaness among deities ! the covered outline of thine aspect sickens often through its uncertainty , but define to us one trait , show us one lineament , clear in awful sincerity ; we may gasp in untold terror , but with that gasp we drink in a breath of thy divinity ; our heart shakes , and its currents sway like rivers lifted by earthquake , but we have swallowed strength . To see and know the worst is to take from Fear her main advantage . The Walravens ' party , augmented in numbers , now became very gay . The gentlemen fetched refreshments from the kiosk , all sat down on the turf under the trees ; they drank healths and sentiments ; they laughed , they jested . M. Emanuel underwent some raillery , half good - humoured , half , I thought , malicious , especially on Madame Beck 's part . I soon gathered that his voyage had been temporarily deferred of his own will , without the concurrence , even against the advice , of his friends ; he had let the Antigua go , and had taken his berth in the Paul et Virginie , appointed to sail a fortnight later . It was his reason for this resolve which they teased him to assign , and which he would only vaguely indicate as "
225369	225404	225362	225362	he	4026	" What was this business ? Nobody knew . Yes , there was one who seemed partly , at least , in his confidence ; a meaning look passed between him and Justine Marie . "
225415	225428	225362	225362	he	4026	" said he . The answer was prompt enough , God knows ? "
225453	225457	225362	225362	he	4026	" And this dear "
225459	226085	225362	225362	he	4026	" took her hand and lifted it to his grateful lips . Upon which demonstration , I saw the light - complexioned young Teuton , Heinrich Muehler , grow restless , as if he did not like it . He even grumbled a few words , whereat M. Emanuel actually laughed in his face , and with the ruthless triumph of the assured conqueror , he drew his ward nearer to him . M. Emanuel was indeed very joyous that night . He seemed not one whit subdued by the change of scene and action impending . He was the true life of the party ; a little despotic , perhaps , determined to be chief in mirth , as well as in labour , yet from moment to moment proving indisputably his right of leadership . His was the wittiest word , the pleasantest anecdote , the frankest laugh . Restlessly active , after his manner , he multiplied himself to wait on all ; but oh ! I saw which was his favourite . I saw at whose feet he lay on the turf , I saw whom he folded carefully from the night air , whom he tended , watched , and cherished as the apple of his eye . Still , hint and raillery flew thick , and still I gathered that while M. Paul should be absent , working for others , these others , not quite ungrateful , would guard for him the treasure he left in Europe . Let him bring them an Indian fortune : they would give him in return a young bride and a rich inheritance . As for the saintly consecration , the vow of constancy , that was forgotten : the blooming and charming Present prevailed over the Past ; and , at length , his nun was indeed buried . Thus it must be . The revelation was indeed come . Presentiment had not been mistaken in her impulse : there is a kind of presentiment which never is mistaken ; it was I who had for a moment miscalculated ; not seeing the true bearing of the oracle , I had thought she muttered of vision when , in truth , her prediction touched reality . I might have paused longer upon what I saw ; I might have deliberated ere I drew inferences . Some , perhaps , would have held the premises doubtful , the proofs insufficient ; some slow sceptics would have incredulously examined ere they conclusively accepted the project of a marriage between a poor and unselfish man of forty , and his wealthy ward of eighteen ; but far from me such shifts and palliatives , far from me such temporary evasion of the actual , such coward fleeing from the dread , the swift - footed , the all - overtaking Fact , such feeble suspense of submission to her the sole sovereign , such paltering and faltering resistance to the Power whose errand is to march conquering and to conquer , such traitor defection from the TRUTH . No . I hastened to accept the whole plan . I extended my grasp and took it all in . I gathered it to me with a sort of rage of haste , and folded it round me , as the soldier struck on the field folds his colours about his breast . I invoked Conviction to nail upon me the certainty , abhorred while embraced , to fix it with the strongest spikes her strongest strokes could drive ; and when the iron had entered well my soul , I stood up , as I thought , renovated . In my infatuation , I said , "
226180	226533	226175	226175	I	0	" Nothing remained now but to take my freedom to my chamber , to carry it with me to my bed and see what I could make of it . The play was not yet , indeed , quite played out . I might have waited and watched longer that love - scene under the trees , that sylvan courtship . Had there been nothing of love in the demonstration , my Fancy in this hour was so generous , so creative , she could have modelled for it the most salient lineaments , and given it the deepest life and highest colour of passion . But I would not look ; I had fixed my resolve , but I would not violate my nature . And then - something tore me so cruelly under my shawl , something so dug into my side , a vulture so strong in beak and talon , I must be alone to grapple with it . I think I never felt jealousy till now . This was not like enduring the endearments of Dr. John and Paulina , against which while I sealed my eyes and my ears , while I withdrew thence my thoughts , my sense of harmony still acknowledged in it a charm . This was an outrage . The love born of beauty was not mine ; I had nothing in common with it : I could not dare to meddle with it , but another love , venturing diffidently into life after long acquaintance , furnace - tried by pain , stamped by constancy , consolidated by affection 's pure and durable alloy , submitted by intellect to intellect 's own tests , and finally wrought up , by his own process , to his own unflawed completeness , this Love that laughed at Passion , his fast frenzies and his hot and hurried extinction , in this Love I had a vested interest ; and whatever tended either to its culture or its destruction , I could not view impassibly . I turned from the group of trees and the "
226536	226583	226175	226175	I	0	" in its shade . Midnight was long past ; the concert was over , the crowds were thinning . I followed the ebb . Leaving the radiant park and well - lit Haute - Ville still well lit , this it seems was to be a "
226586	227684	227685	227689	The nun of the attic	7700	" in Villette , I sought the dim lower quarter . Dim I should not say , for the beauty of moonlight - forgotten in the park - here once more flowed in upon perception . High she rode , and calm and stainlessly she shone . The music and the mirth of the fete , the fire and bright hues of those lamps had out - done and out - shone her for an hour , but now , again , her glory and her silence triumphed . The rival lamps were dying : she held her course like a white fate . Drum , trumpet , bugle , had uttered their clangour , and were forgotten ; with pencil - ray she wrote on heaven and on earth records for archives everlasting . She and those stars seemed to me at once the types and witnesses of truth all regnant . The night - sky lit her reign : like its slow - wheeling progress , advanced her victory - that onward movement which has been , and is , and will be from eternity to eternity . These oil - twinkling streets are very still : I like them for their lowliness and peace . Homeward - bound burghers pass me now and then , but these companies are pedestrians , make little noise , and are soon gone . So well do I love Villette under her present aspect , not willingly would I re - enter under a roof , but that I am bent on pursuing my strange adventure to a successful close , and quietly regaining my bed in the great dormitory , before Madame Beck comes home . Only one street lies between me and the Rue Fossette ; as I enter it , for the first time , the sound of a carriage tears up the deep peace of this quarter . It comes this way - comes very fast . How loud sounds its rattle on the paved path ! The street is narrow , and I keep carefully to the causeway . The carriage thunders past , but what do I see , or fancy I see , as it rushes by ? Surely something white fluttered from that window - surely a hand waved a handkerchief . Was that signal meant for me ? Am I known ? Who could recognise me ? That is not M. de Bassompierre 's carriage , nor Mrs. Bretton 's ; and besides , neither the Hotel Crecy nor the chateau of La Terrasse lies in that direction . Well , I have no time for conjecture ; I must hurry home . Gaining the Rue Fossette , reaching the pensionnat , all there was still ; no fiacre had yet arrived with Madame and Desiree . I had left the great door ajar ; should I find it thus ? Perhaps the wind or some other accident may have thrown it to with sufficient force to start the spring - bolt ? In that case , hopeless became admission ; my adventure must issue in catastrophe . I lightly pushed the heavy leaf ; would it yield ? Yes . As soundless , as unresisting , as if some propitious genius had waited on a sesame - charm , in the vestibule within . Entering with bated breath , quietly making all fast , shoelessly mounting the staircase , I sought the dormitory , and reached my couch . Ay ! I reached it , and once more drew a free inspiration . The next moment , I almost shrieked - almost , but not quite , thank Heaven ! Throughout the dormitory , throughout the house , there reigned at this hour the stillness of death . All slept , and in such hush , it seemed that none dreamed . Stretched on the nineteen beds lay nineteen forms , at full - length and motionless . On mine - the twentieth couch - nothing ought to have lain : I had left it void , and void should have found it . What , then ; do I see between the half - drawn curtains ? What dark , usurping shape , supine , long , and strange ? Is it a robber who has made his way through the open street - door , and lies there in wait ? It looks very black , I think it looks - not human . Can it be a wandering dog that has come in from the street and crept and nestled hither ? Will it spring , will it leap out if I approach ? Approach I must . Courage ! One step ! - My head reeled , for by the faint night - lamp , I saw stretched on my bed the old phantom - the NUN . A cry at this moment might have ruined me . Be the spectacle what it might , I could afford neither consternation , scream , nor swoon . Besides , I was not overcome . Tempered by late incidents , my nerves disdained hysteria . Warm from illuminations , and music , and thronging thousands , thoroughly lashed up by a new scourge , I defied spectra . In a moment , without exclamation , I had rushed on the haunted couch ; nothing leaped out , or sprung , or stirred ; all the movement was mine , so was all the life , the reality , the substance , the force ; as my instinct felt . I tore her up - the incubus ! I held her on high - the goblin ! I shook her loose - the mystery ! And down she fell - down all around me - down in shreds and fragments - and I trode upon her . Here again - behold the branchless tree , the unstabled Rosinante ; the film of cloud , the flicker of moonshine . The long nun proved a long bolster dressed in a long black stole , and artfully invested with a white veil . The garments in very truth , strange as it may seem , were genuine nun 's garments , and by some hand they had been disposed with a view to illusion . Whence came these vestments ? Who contrived this artifice ? These questions still remained . To the head - bandage was pinned a slip of paper : it bore in pencil these mocking words - "
227708	228694	227697	227697	She	142	" And what and who was she that had haunted me ? She , I had actually seen three times . Not a woman of my acquaintance had the stature of that ghost . She was not of a female height . Not to any man I knew could the machination , for a moment , be attributed . Still mystified beyond expression , but as thoroughly , as suddenly , relieved from all sense of the spectral and unearthly ; scorning also to wear out my brain with the fret of a trivial though insoluble riddle , I just bundled together stole , veil , and bandages , thrust them beneath my pillow , lay down , listened till I heard the wheels of Madame 's home - returning fiacre , then turned , and worn out by many nights ' vigils , conquered , too , perhaps , by the now reacting narcotic , I deeply slept . CHAPTER XL . THE HAPPY PAIR . The day succeeding this remarkable Midsummer night , proved no common day . I do not mean that it brought signs in heaven above , or portents on the earth beneath ; nor do I allude to meteorological phenomena , to storm , flood , or whirlwind . On the contrary : the sun rose jocund , with a July face . Morning decked her beauty with rubies , and so filled her lap with roses , that they fell from her in showers , making her path blush : the Hours woke fresh as nymphs , and emptying on the early hills their dew - vials , they stepped out dismantled of vapour : shadowless , azure , and glorious , they led the sun 's steeds on a burning and unclouded course . In short , it was as fine a day as the finest summer could boast ; but I doubt whether I was not the sole inhabitant of the Rue Fossette , who cared or remembered to note this pleasant fact . Another thought busied all other heads ; a thought , indeed , which had its share in my meditations ; but this master consideration , not possessing for me so entire a novelty , so overwhelming a suddenness , especially so dense a mystery , as it offered to the majority of my co - speculators thereon , left me somewhat more open than the rest to any collateral observation or impression . Still , while walking in the garden , feeling the sunshine , and marking the blooming and growing plants , I pondered the same subject the whole house discussed . What subject ? Merely this . When matins came to be said , there was a place vacant in the first rank of boarders . When breakfast was served , there remained a coffee - cup unclaimed . When the housemaid made the beds , she found in one , a bolster laid lengthwise , clad in a cap and night - gown ; and when Ginevra Fanshawe 's music - mistress came early , as usual , to give the morning lesson , that accomplished and promising young person , her pupil , failed utterly to be forthcoming . High and low was Miss Fanshawe sought ; through length and breadth was the house ransacked ; vainly ; not a trace , not an indication , not so much as a scrap of a billet rewarded the search ; the nymph was vanished , engulfed in the past night , like a shooting star swallowed up by darkness . Deep was the dismay of surveillante teachers , deeper the horror of the defaulting directress . Never had I seen Madame Beck so pale or so appalled . Here was a blow struck at her tender part , her weak side ; here was damage done to her interest . How , too , had the untoward event happened ? By what outlet had the fugitive taken wing ? Not a casement was found unfastened , not a pane of glass broken ; all the doors were bolted secure . Never to this day has Madame Beck obtained satisfaction on this point , nor indeed has anybody else concerned , save and excepting one , Lucy Snowe , who could not forget how , to facilitate a certain enterprise , a certain great door had been drawn softly to its lintel , closed , indeed , but neither bolted nor secure . The thundering carriage - and - pair encountered were now likewise recalled , as well as that puzzling signal , the waved handkerchief . From these premises , and one or two others , inaccessible to any but myself , I could draw but one inference . It was a case of elopement . Morally certain on this head , and seeing Madame Beck 's profound embarrassment , I at last communicated my conviction . Having alluded to M. de Hamal 's suit , I found , as I expected , that Madame Beck was perfectly au fait to that affair . She had long since discussed it with Mrs. Cholmondeley , and laid her own responsibility in the business on that lady 's shoulders . To Mrs. Cholmondeley and M. de Bassompierre she now had recourse . We found that the Hotel Crecy was already alive to what had happened . Ginevra had written to her cousin Paulina , vaguely signifying hymeneal intentions ; communications had been received from the family of de Hamal ; M. de Bassompierre was on the track of the fugitives . He overtook them too late . In the course of the week , the post brought me a note . I may as well transcribe it ; it contains explanation on more than one point : - ' DEAR OLD TIM "
228700	228927	228697	228697	Timon	318	" I am off you see - gone like a shot . Alfred and I intended to be married in this way almost from the first ; we never meant to be spliced in the humdrum way of other people ; Alfred has too much spirit for that , and so have I - Dieu merci ! Do you know , Alfred , who used to call you ' the dragon , ' has seen so much of you during the last few months , that he begins to feel quite friendly towards you . He hopes you wo n't miss him now that he has gone ; he begs to apologize for any little trouble he may have given you . He is afraid he rather inconvenienced you once when he came upon you in the grenier , just as you were reading a letter seemingly of the most special interest ; but he could not resist the temptation to give you a start , you appeared so wonderfully taken up with your correspondent . En revanche , he says you once frightened him by rushing in for a dress or a shawl , or some other chiffon , at the moment when he had struck a light , and was going to take a quiet whiff of his cigar , while waiting for me . "
229242	229330	229336	229336	you	4054	" But for the nun 's black gown and white veil , he would have been caught again and again both by you and that tiger - Jesuit , M. Paul . He thinks you both capital ghost - seers , and very brave . What I wonder at is , rather your secretiveness than your courage . How could you endure the visitations of that long spectre , time after time , without crying out , telling everybody , and rousing the whole house and neighbourhood ? "
229426	229777	229419	229419	You	4054	" Well , dear grandmother ! and are you not mightily angry at my moonlight flitting and run away match ? I assure you it is excellent fun , and I did it partly to spite that minx , Paulina , and that bear , Dr. John : to show them that , with all their airs , I could get married as well as they . M. de Bassompierre was at first in a strange fume with Alfred ; he threatened a prosecution for ' detournement de mineur , ' and I know not what ; he was so abominably in earnest , that I found myself forced to do a little bit of the melodramatic - go down on my knees , sob , cry , drench three pocket - handkerchiefs . Of course , ' mon oncle ' soon gave in ; indeed , where was the use of making a fuss ? I am married , and that 's all about it . He still says our marriage is not legal , because I am not of age , forsooth ! As if that made any difference ! I am just as much married as if I were a hundred . However , we are to be married again , and I am to have a trousseau , and Mrs. Cholmondeley is going to superintend it ; and there are some hopes that M. de Bassompierre will give me a decent portion , which will be very convenient , as dear Alfred has nothing but his nobility , native and hereditary , and his pay . I only wish uncle would do things unconditionally , in a generous , gentleman - like fashion ; he is so disagreeable as to make the dowry depend on Alfred 's giving his written promise that he will never touch cards or dice from the day it is paid down . They accuse my angel of a tendency to play : I do n't know anything about that , but I do know he is a dear , adorable creature . "
229889	229932	229878	229878	you	4062	" Adieu ! Rejoice in my good luck : congratulate me on my supreme happiness , and believe me , dear cynic and misanthrope , yours , in the best of health and spirits , GINEVRA LAURA DE HAMAL , nee FANSHAWE . "
229986	230112	229980	229982	Mrs. John Bretton	483	" In winding up Mistress Fanshawe 's memoirs , the reader will no doubt expect to hear that she came finally to bitter expiation of her youthful levities . Of course , a large share of suffering lies in reserve for her future . A few words will embody my farther knowledge respecting her . I saw her towards the close of her honeymoon . She called on Madame Beck , and sent for me into the salon . She rushed into my arms laughing . She looked very blooming and beautiful : her curls were longer , her cheeks rosier than ever : her white bonnet and her Flanders veil , her orange - flowers and her bride 's dress , became her mightily . "
230119	230150	230116	230116	my	0	" she cried at once ; Ginevra ever stuck to the substantial ; I always thought there was a good trading element in her composition , much as she scorned the "
230153	230154	230116	230116	my	0	" "
230252	230327	230247	230247	Alfred	230	" And Alfred appeared from the inner salon , where he was talking to Madame Beck , receiving the blended felicitations and reprimands of that lady . I was presented under my various names : the Dragon , Diogenes , and Timon . The young Colonel was very polite . He made me a prettily - turned , neatly - worded apology , about the ghost - visits , c. , concluding with saying that "
230338	230622	230628	230629	a mother	4301	" pointing to his bride . And then the bride sent him back to Madame Beck , and she took me to herself , and proceeded literally to suffocate me with her unrestrained spirits , her girlish , giddy , wild nonsense . She showed her ring exultingly ; she called herself Madame la Comtesse de Hamal , and asked how it sounded , a score of times . I said very little . I gave her only the crust and rind of my nature . No matter she expected of me nothing better - she knew me too well to look for compliments - my dry gibes pleased her well enough and the more impassible and prosaic my mien , the more merrily she laughed . Soon after his marriage , M. de Hamal was persuaded to leave the army as the surest way of weaning him from certain unprofitable associates and habits ; a post of attache was procured for him , and he and his young wife went abroad . I thought she would forget me now , but she did not . For many years , she kept up a capricious , fitful sort of correspondence . During the first year or two , it was only of herself and Alfred she wrote ; then , Alfred faded in the background ; herself and a certain , new comer prevailed ; one Alfred Fanshawe de Bassompierre de Hamal began to reign in his father 's stead . There were great boastings about this personage , extravagant amplifications upon miracles of precocity , mixed with vehement objurgations against the phlegmatic incredulity with which I received them . I did n't know "
230631	230632	230628	230629	a mother	4301	" "
230652	230768	230628	230629	a mother	4301	" and so on . In due course of nature this young gentleman took his degrees in teething , measles , hooping - cough : that was a terrible time for me - the mamma 's letters became a perfect shout of affliction ; never woman was so put upon by calamity : never human being stood in such need of sympathy . I was frightened at first , and wrote back pathetically ; but I soon found out there was more cry than wool in the business , and relapsed into my natural cruel insensibility . As to the youthful sufferer , he weathered each storm like a hero . Five times was that youth "
230773	230821	230628	230629	a mother	4301	" and five times did he miraculously revive . In the course of years there arose ominous murmurings against Alfred the First ; M. de Bassompierre had to be appealed to , debts had to be paid , some of them of that dismal and dingy order called "
230826	231429	230628	230629	a mother	4301	" ignoble plaints and difficulties became frequent . Under every cloud , no matter what its nature , Ginevra , as of old , called out lustily for sympathy and aid . She had no notion of meeting any distress single - handed . In some shape , from some quarter or other , she was pretty sure to obtain her will , and so she got on - fighting the battle of life by proxy , and , on the whole , suffering as little as any human being I have ever known . CHAPTER XLI . FAUBOURG CLOTILDE . Must I , ere I close , render some account of that Freedom and Renovation which I won on the fete - night ? Must I tell how I and the two stalwart companions I brought home from the illuminated park bore the test of intimate acquaintance ? I tried them the very next day . They had boasted their strength loudly when they reclaimed me from love and its bondage , but upon my demanding deeds , not words , some evidence of better comfort , some experience of a relieved life - Freedom excused himself , as for the present impoverished and disabled to assist ; and Renovation never spoke ; he had died in the night suddenly . I had nothing left for it then but to trust secretly that conjecture might have hurried me too fast and too far , to sustain the oppressive hour by reminders of the distorting and discolouring magic of jealousy . After a short and vain struggle , I found myself brought back captive to the old rack of suspense , tied down and strained anew . Shall I yet see him before he goes ? Will he bear me in mind ? Does he purpose to come ? Will this day - will the next hour bring him ? or must I again assay that corroding pain of long attent - that rude agony of rupture at the close , that mute , mortal wrench , which , in at once uprooting hope and doubt , shakes life ; while the hand that does the violence can not be caressed to pity , because absence interposes her barrier ! It was the Feast of the Assumption ; no school was held . The boarders and teachers , after attending mass in the morning , were gone a long walk into the country to take their gouter , or afternoon meal , at some farm - house . I did not go with them , for now but two days remained ere the Paul et Virginie must sail , and I was clinging to my last chance , as the living waif of a wreck clings to his last raft or cable . There was some joiners ' work to do in the first classe , some bench or desk to repair ; holidays were often turned to account for the performance of these operations , which could not be executed when the rooms were filled with pupils . As I sat solitary , purposing to adjourn to the garden and leave the coast clear , but too listless to fulfil my own intent , I heard the workmen coming . Foreign artisans and servants do everything by couples : I believe it would take two Labassecourien carpenters to drive a nail . While tying on my bonnet , which had hitherto hung by its ribbons from my idle hand , I vaguely and momentarily wondered to hear the step of but one "
231432	231977	231978	231978	Paul	196	" I noted , too - as captives in dungeons find sometimes dreary leisure to note the merest trifles - that this man wore shoes , and not sabots : I concluded that it must be the master - carpenter , coming to inspect before he sent his journeymen . I threw round me my scarf . He advanced ; he opened the door ; my back was towards it ; I felt a little thrill - a curious sensation , too quick and transient to be analyzed . I turned , I stood in the supposed master - artisan 's presence : looking towards the door - way , I saw it filled with a figure , and my eyes printed upon my brain the picture of M. Paul . Hundreds of the prayers with which we weary Heaven bring to the suppliant no fulfilment . Once haply in life , one golden gift falls prone in the lap - one boon full and bright , perfect from Fruition 's mint . M. Emanuel wore the dress in which he probably purposed to travel - a surtout , guarded with velvet ; I thought him prepared for instant departure , and yet I had understood that two days were yet to run before the ship sailed . He looked well and cheerful . He looked kind and benign : he came in with eagerness ; he was close to me in one second ; he was all amity . It might be his bridegroom mood which thus brightened him . Whatever the cause , I could not meet his sunshine with cloud . If this were my last moment with him , I would not waste it in forced , unnatural distance . I loved him well - too well not to smite out of my path even Jealousy herself , when she would have obstructed a kind farewell . A cordial word from his lips , or a gentle look from his eyes , would do me good , for all the span of life that remained to me ; it would be comfort in the last strait of loneliness ; I would take it - I would taste the elixir , and pride should not spill the cup . The interview would be short , of course : he would say to me just what he had said to each of the assembled pupils ; he would take and hold my hand two minutes ; he would touch my cheek with his lips for the first , last , only time - and then - no more . Then , indeed , the final parting , then the wide separation , the great gulf I could not pass to go to him - across which , haply , he would not glance , to remember me . He took my hand in one of his , with the other he put back my bonnet ; he looked into my face , his luminous smile went out , his lips expressed something almost like the wordless language of a mother who finds a child greatly and unexpectedly changed , broken with illness , or worn out by want . A check supervened . "
231982	231991	231992	231992	Paul	196	" said a woman 's hurried voice behind , "
232035	232064	232028	232028	Paul	196	" Madame Beck , brought to the spot by vigilance or an inscrutable instinct , pressed so near , she almost thrust herself between me and M. Emanuel . "
232069	232121	232067	232067	Paul	196	" she reiterated , her eye grazing me with its hard ray like a steel stylet . She pushed against her kinsman . I thought he receded ; I thought he would go . Pierced deeper than I could endure , made now to feel what defied suppression , I cried - "
232127	232157	232067	232067	Paul	196	" What I felt seemed literal heart - break ; but the seal of another fountain yielded under the strain : one breath from M. Paul , the whisper , "
232161	232195	232067	232067	Paul	196	" lifted a load , opened an outlet . With many a deep sob , with thrilling , with icy shiver , with strong trembling , and yet with relief - I wept . "
232218	232258	232206	232206	I	0	" said the calm Madame Beck . To be left to her and her cordial seemed to me something like being left to the poisoner and her bowl . When M. Paul answered deeply , harshly , and briefly - "
232263	232281	232206	232206	I	0	" in the grim sound I felt a music strange , strong , but life - giving . "
232286	232304	232206	232206	I	0	" he repeated , his nostrils opening , and his facial muscles all quivering as he spoke . "
232311	232324	232206	232206	I	0	" said Madame , with sternness . More sternly rejoined her kinsman - "
232328	232329	232330	232330	I	0	" "
232346	232351	232352	232352	Femme	490	" she threatened pertinaciously . "
232354	232375	232352	232352	Femme	490	" cried the Professor , not now in his deep tones , but in his highest and most excited key , "
232382	232404	232376	232376	Femme	490	" He was roused , and I loved him in his wrath with a passion beyond what I had yet felt . "
232411	232415	232376	232376	Femme	490	" pursued Madame ; "
232457	232458	232459	232459	You	4081	" "
232472	232476	232463	232463	I	0	" said he , "
232490	232496	232516	232516	You	4081	" he continued less fiercely , "
232573	232579	232581	232581	me	0	" This time , in the "
232582	232785	232581	232581	me	0	" there was an intonation so bitter and so imperative , I wondered that even Madame Beck herself could for one moment delay obedience ; but she stood firm ; she gazed upon him dauntless ; she met his eye , forbidding and fixed as stone . She was opening her lips to retort ; I saw over all M. Paul 's face a quick rising light and fire ; I can hardly tell how he managed the movement ; it did not seem violent ; it kept the form of courtesy ; he gave his hand ; it scarce touched her I thought ; she ran , she whirled from the room ; she was gone , and the door shut , in one second . The flash of passion was all over very soon . He smiled as he told me to wipe my eyes ; he waited quietly till I was calm , dropping from time to time a stilling , solacing word . Ere long I sat beside him once more myself - re - assured , not desperate , nor yet desolate ; not friendless , not hopeless , not sick of life , and seeking death . "
232797	232801	232581	232581	me	0	" said he . "
232811	232815	232809	232809	Monsieur	4089	" I said . "
232849	232850	232830	232830	I	0	" "
232925	232926	232923	232923	myself	0	" "
232943	232944	232936	232936	Monsieur	4091	" "
232973	233047	232965	232965	I	0	" Without questioning his meaning , or sounding his plan , or offering the semblance of an objection , I re - tied my bonnet : I was ready . The route he took was by the boulevards : he several times made me sit down on the seats stationed under the lime - trees ; he did not ask if I was tired , but looked , and drew his own conclusions . "
233053	233122	232965	232965	I	0	" said he , repeating my words , with a gentle , kindly mimicry of my voice and foreign accent , not new from his lips , and of which the playful banter never wounded , not even when coupled , as it often was , with the assertion , that however I might write his language , I spoke and always should speak it imperfectly and hesitatingly . "
233187	233211	233232	233232	Constancy	491	" , I lifted my happy eyes : they were happy now , or they would have been no interpreters of my heart . "
233214	233224	233232	233232	Constancy	491	" said he , after some seconds ' scrutiny , "
233247	233248	233295	233295	me	0	" "
233252	233259	233295	233295	me	0	" I said , with truth . "
233275	233276	233264	233264	Monsieur	4096	" "
233282	233290	233264	233264	Monsieur	4096	" said he , speaking to himself ; "
233299	233300	233295	233295	me	0	" "
233313	233385	233295	233295	me	0	" I could not help saying this ; the words came unbidden : I never remember the time when I had not a haunting dread of what might be the degree of my outward deficiency ; this dread pressed me at the moment with special force . A great softness passed upon his countenance ; his violet eyes grew suffused and glistening under their deep Spanish lashes : he started up ; "
233391	233392	233295	233295	me	0	" "
233400	233627	233630	233630	I	0	" I took courage to urge : the point had its vital import for me . He stopped , and gave me a short , strong answer ; an answer which silenced , subdued , yet profoundly satisfied . Ever after that I knew what I was for him ; and what I might be for the rest of the world , I ceased painfully to care . Was it weak to lay so much stress on an opinion about appearance ? I fear it might be ; I fear it was ; but in that case I must avow no light share of weakness . I must own great fear of displeasing - a strong wish moderately to please M. Paul . Whither we rambled , I scarce knew . Our walk was long , yet seemed short ; the path was pleasant , the day lovely . M. Emanuel talked of his voyage - he thought of staying away three years . On his return from Guadaloupe , he looked forward to release from liabilities and a clear course ; and what did I purpose doing in the interval of his absence ? he asked . I had talked once , he reminded me , of trying to be independent and keeping a little school of my own : had I dropped the idea ? "
233651	233652	233653	233653	He	4098	" "
233685	233700	233664	233664	he	4098	" This was certain ; but I promised to do my best to endure . "
233703	233710	233664	233664	he	4098	" said he , speaking low , "
233781	233782	233808	233809	twenty directresses	4103	" "
233788	233792	233785	233785	you	0	" said I , "
233838	233839	233832	233832	Monsieur	4105	" "
233844	233848	233832	233832	Monsieur	4105	" rejoined he ; "
233863	233918	233919	233919	I	0	" So speaking , he paused . We were now returning from the long walk . We had reached the middle of a clean Faubourg , where the houses were small , but looked pleasant . It was before the white door - step of a very neat abode that M. Paul had halted . "
233923	234191	233919	233919	I	0	" said he . He did not knock , but taking from his pocket a key , he opened and entered at once . Ushering me in , he shut the door behind us . No servant appeared . The vestibule was small , like the house , but freshly and tastefully painted ; its vista closed in a French window with vines trained about the panes , tendrils , and green leaves kissing the glass . Silence reigned in this dwelling . Opening an inner door , M. Paul disclosed a parlour , or salon - very tiny , but I thought , very pretty . Its delicate walls were tinged like a blush ; its floor was waxed ; a square of brilliant carpet covered its centre ; its small round table shone like the mirror over its hearth ; there was a little couch , a little chiffonniere , the half - open , crimson - silk door of which , showed porcelain on the shelves ; there was a French clock , a lamp ; there were ornaments in biscuit china ; the recess of the single ample window was filled with a green stand , bearing three green flower - pots , each filled with a fine plant glowing in bloom ; in one corner appeared a gueridon with a marble top , and upon it a work - box , and a glass filled with violets in water . The lattice of this room was open ; the outer air breathing through , gave freshness , the sweet violets lent fragrance . "
234197	234209	233919	233919	I	0	" said I. M. Paul smiled to see me so pleased . "
234218	234233	234234	234234	We	4107	" I asked in a whisper , half awed by the deep pervading hush . "
234248	234252	234234	234234	We	4107	" he replied . "
234265	234269	234254	234254	you	4109	" I inquired . "
234275	234323	234254	234254	you	4109	" said he , quietly . He led the way . I was shown a little kitchen with a little stove and oven , with few but bright brasses , two chairs and a table . A small cupboard held a diminutive but commodious set of earthenware . "
234335	234437	234254	234254	you	4109	" said M. Paul , as I looked at the six green and white dinner - plates ; the four dishes , the cups and jugs to match . Conducted up the narrow but clean staircase , I was permitted a glimpse of two pretty cabinets of sleeping - rooms ; finally , I was once more led below , and we halted with a certain ceremony before a larger door than had yet been opened . Producing a second key , M. Emanuel adjusted it to the lock of this door . He opened , put me in before him . "
234440	234541	234254	234254	you	4109	" he cried . I found myself in a good - sized apartment , scrupulously clean , though bare , compared with those I had hitherto seen . The well - scoured boards were carpetless ; it contained two rows of green benches and desks , with an alley down the centre , terminating in an estrade , a teacher 's chair and table ; behind them a tableau , On the walls hung two maps ; in the windows flowered a few hardy plants ; in short , here was a miniature classe - complete , neat , pleasant . "
234548	234551	234254	234254	you	4109	" said I. "
234566	234567	234556	234556	I	0	" "
234589	234624	234569	234569	you	4115	" asked he , taking from his surtout - pocket some quires of these documents , and putting them into my hand . I looked , I read - printed in fair characters : - "
234641	234756	234758	234758	you	4115	" And what did I say to M. Paul Emanuel ? Certain junctures of our lives must always be difficult of recall to memory . Certain points , crises , certain feelings , joys , griefs , and amazements , when reviewed , must strike us as things wildered and whirling , dim as a wheel fast spun . I can no more remember the thoughts or the words of the ten minutes succeeding this disclosure , than I can retrace the experience of my earliest year of life : and yet the first thing distinct to me is the consciousness that I was speaking very fast , repeating over and over again : - "
234804	234830	234799	234799	me	0	" But he would not speak . His pleased silence , his laughing down - look , his attitude , are visible to me now . "
234842	234872	234835	234835	I	0	" I cried . The packet of papers fell on the floor . He had extended his hand , and I had fastened thereon , oblivious of all else . "
234886	234890	234875	234875	you	0	" said he . "
234933	235040	234922	234922	Lucy	333	" I hardly knew what to do . I first caressed the soft velvet on his cuff , and then . I stroked the hand it surrounded . It was his foresight , his goodness , his silent , strong , effective goodness , that overpowered me by their proved reality . It was the assurance of his sleepless interest which broke on me like a light from heaven ; it was his - I will dare to say it - his fond , tender look , which now shook me indescribably . In the midst of all I forced myself to look at the practical . "
235044	235048	234922	234922	Lucy	333	" I cried , "
235060	235061	235054	235054	you	196	" "
235066	235071	235054	235054	you	196	" said he heartily . "
235203	235207	235208	235208	you	196	" he pursued , "
235250	235274	235275	235275	I	0	" There he left a blank . I promised to do all he told me . I promised to work hard and willingly . "
235282	235286	235275	235275	I	0	" I said ; "
235307	235776	235298	235298	Monsieur	1465	" In such inadequate language my feelings struggled for expression : they could not get it ; speech , brittle and unmalleable , and cold as ice , dissolved or shivered in the effort . He watched me , still ; he gently raised his hand to stroke my hair ; it touched my lips in passing ; I pressed it close , I paid it tribute . He was my king ; royal for me had been that hand 's bounty ; to offer homage was both a joy and a duty . The afternoon hours were over , and the stiller time of evening shaded the quiet faubourg . M. Paul claimed my hospitality ; occupied and afoot since morning , he needed refreshment ; he said I should offer him chocolate in my pretty gold and white china service . He went out and ordered what was needful from the restaurant ; he placed the small gueridon and two chairs in the balcony outside the French window under the screening vines . With what shy joy i accepted my part as hostess , arranged the salver , served the benefactor - guest . This balcony was in the rear of the house , the gardens of the faubourg were round us , fields extended beyond . The air was still , mild , and fresh . Above the poplars , the laurels , the cypresses , and the roses , looked up a moon so lovely and so halcyon , the heart trembled under her smile ; a star shone subject beside her , with the unemulous ray of pure love . In a large garden near us , a jet rose from a well , and a pale statue leaned over the play of waters . M. Paul talked to me . His voice was so modulated that it mixed harmonious with the silver whisper , the gush , the musical sigh , in which light breeze , fountain and foliage intoned their lulling vesper : Happy hour - stay one moment ! droop those plumes , rest those wings ; incline to mine that brow of Heaven ! White Angel ! let thy light linger ; leave its reflection on succeeding clouds ; bequeath its cheer to that time which needs a ray in retrospect ! Our meal was simple : the chocolate , the rolls , the plate of fresh summer fruit , cherries and strawberries bedded in green leaves formed the whole : but it was what we both liked better than a feast , and I took a delight inexpressible in tending M. Paul . I asked him whether his friends , Pere Silas and Madame Beck , knew what he had done - whether they had seen my house ? "
235780	235784	235298	235298	Monsieur	1465	" said he , "
235833	235835	235836	235836	I	0	" smiling "
235882	236049	235869	235869	she	142	" This was true enough : I had not spared him on this point , nor perhaps on any other that was assailable . Magnificent - minded , grand - hearted , dear , faulty little man ! You deserved candour , and from me always had it . Continuing my queries , I asked to whom the house belonged , who was my landlord , the amount of my rent . He instantly gave me these particulars in writing ; he had foreseen and prepared all things . The house was not M. Paul 's - that I guessed : he was hardly the man to become a proprietor ; I more than suspected in him a lamentable absence of the saving faculty ; he could get , but not keep ; he needed a treasurer . The tenement , then , belonged to a citizen in the Basse- Ville - a man of substance , M. Paul said ; he startled me by adding : "
236069	236164	235869	235869	she	142	" And , to my pleasant surprise , I found the landlord was none other than M. Miret , the short - tempered and kind - hearted bookseller , who had so kindly found me a seat that eventful night in the park . It seems M. Miret was , in his station , rich , as well as much respected , and possessed several houses in this faubourg ; the rent was moderate , scarce half of what it would have been for a house of equal size nearer the centre of Villette . "
236168	236237	235869	235869	she	142	" observed M. Paul , ' should fortune not favour you , though I think she will , I have the satisfaction to think you are in good hands ; M. Miret will not be extortionate : the first year 's rent you have already in your savings ; afterwards Miss Lucy must trust God , and herself . But now , what will you do for pupils ? "
236238	236245	236058	236067	a person who has a most respectful regard for you	4130	" I must distribute my prospectuses . "
236246	236284	235869	235869	she	142	" Right ! By way of losing no time , I gave one to M. Miret yesterday . Should you object to beginning with three petite bourgeoises , the Demoiselles Miret ? They are at your service . "
236285	236343	235869	235869	she	142	" Monsieur , you forget nothing ; you are wonderful . Object ? It would become me indeed to object ! I suppose I hardly expect at the outset to number aristocrats in my little day - school ; I care not if they never come . I shall be proud to receive M. Miret 's daughters . "
236344	236348	236350	236350	he	4131	" Besides these , "
236352	236391	236350	236350	he	4131	" another pupil offers , who will come daily to take lessons in English ; and as she is rich , she will pay handsomely . I mean my god - daughter and ward , Justine Marie Sauveur . "
236448	236452	236454	236455	M. Paul	196	" What now ? "
236457	236460	236454	236455	M. Paul	196	" Nothing . "
236461	236492	236493	236493	I	0	" Nothing ! Your countenance changes : your colour and your very eyes fade . Nothing ! You must be ill ; you have some suffering ; tell me what . "
236535	236543	236545	236545	he	196	" Justine Marie is a good girl , "
236547	236561	236545	236545	he	196	" docile and amiable ; not quick - but you will like her . "
236562	236575	236578	236578	my	0	" I think not . I think she must not come here . "
236581	236621	236622	236622	His	196	" Do you wish to puzzle me ? Do you know her ? But , in truth , there is something . Again you are pale as that statue . Rely on Paul Carlos ; tell him the grief . "
236638	236645	236647	236647	he	196	" Do you know Marie Justine ? "
236793	236801	236802	236802	I	0	" I want to tell you something , "
236805	236813	236802	236802	I	0	" I want to tell you all . "
236814	236844	236845	236845	I	0	" Speak , Lucy ; come near ; speak . Who prizes you , if I do not ? Who is your friend , if not Emanuel ? Speak ! "
237239	237260	237261	237261	We	4141	" Lucy , take my love . One day share my life . Be my dearest , first on earth . "
238492	238537	238488	238488	He	4182	" Remain a Protestant . My little English Puritan , I love Protestantism in you . I own its severe charm . There is something in its ritual I can not receive myself , but it is the sole creed for ' Lucy . ' "
