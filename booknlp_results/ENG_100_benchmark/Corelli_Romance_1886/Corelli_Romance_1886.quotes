If it is in truth a work of art , let it speak to you as art only , and spare the poor workman who has called it into existence the shame of having to confess that it is not above human praise . The only true criticism of high art is silence - silence as grand as heaven itself . "

3923	3955	3917	3917	I	0	" Signor Cellini , I can not imagine why you should wish so to waste your valuable time . There is nothing in my poor physiognomy worthy of your briefest attention . "
3956	3964	3965	3965	he	348	" You must pardon me , mademoiselle , "
3969	4090	3965	3965	he	348	" if I presume to differ from you . I am exceedingly anxious to transfer your features to my canvas . I am aware that you are not in strong health , and that your face has not that roundness and colour formerly habitual to it . But I am not an admirer of the milkmaid type of beauty . Everywhere I seek for intelligence , for thought , for inward refinement - in short , mademoiselle , you have the face of one whom the inner soul consumes , and , as such , may I plead again with you to give me a little of your spare time ? YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT , I ASSURE YOU . "

4249	4259	4260	4260	he	358	" It will depend on its appearance when completed , "

Why , who but a lunatic would say that the only criticism of art is silence ? Is n't that utter rubbish ? "

4565	4626	4407	4407	she	365	" Well , it 's all the same . How can there be any criticism at all in silence ? According to his idea when we admire anything very much we ought to go round with long faces and gags on our mouths . That would be entirely ridiculous ! And what was that dreadful thing he said to you ? "

5346	5383	5342	5342	I	0	" YOU forbid me , signor ? Surely you forget yourself . What harm have I done in helping myself to a simple glass of water in your studio ? You are not usually so inhospitable . "
5406	5435	5403	5403	he	97	" Forgive me , mademoiselle , for my brusquerie . It is true I forgot myself for a moment . But you were in danger , and - - "
5436	5440	5441	5441	I	0	" In danger ! "
5445	5452	5454	5454	he	97	" Yes , mademoiselle . This , "
5464	5500	5454	5454	he	97	" is not water simply . If you will observe it now with the sunshine beating full against it , I think you will perceive peculiarities in it that will assure you of my veracity . "
5555	5560	5561	5561	I	0	" What is it ? "
5571	5587	5561	5561	I	0	" Are you the possessor of a specimen of the far - famed Aqua Tofana ? "
5632	5702	5629	5629	he	97	" Aqua Tofana , mademoiselle , is a deadly poison , known to the ancients and also to many learned chemists of our day . It is a clear and colourless liquid , but it is absolutely still - as still as a stagnant pool . What I have just shown you is not poison , but quite the reverse . I will prove this to you at once . "
5734	5740	5741	5741	I	0	" But , Signor Cellini , "
5744	5776	5741	5741	I	0	" if it is so harmless , why did you forbid my tasting it ? Why did you say there was danger for me when I was about to drink it ? "
5777	5898	6035	6035	he	97	" Because , mademoiselle , for YOU it would be dangerous . Your health is weak , your nerves unstrung . That elixir is a powerful vivifying tonic , acting with great rapidity on the entire system , and rushing through the veins with the swiftness of ELECTRICITY . I am accustomed to it ; it is my daily medicine . But I was brought to it by slow , and almost imperceptible degrees . A single teaspoonful of that fluid , mademoiselle , administered to anyone not prepared to receive it , would be instant death , though its actual use is to vivify and strengthen human life . You understand now why I said you were in danger ? "
5899	5903	5904	5904	I	0	" I understand , "
5917	5925	6035	6035	he	97	" And you forgive my seeming rudeness ? "
5926	5951	6035	6035	he	97	" Oh , certainly ! But you have aroused my curiosity . I should like to know more about this strange medicine of yours . "
5952	5961	5963	5963	Cellini	97	" You shall know more if you wish , "
5976	6029	5963	5963	Cellini	97	" You shall know everything ; but not to - day . We have too little time . I have not yet commenced your picture . And I forgot - you were thirsty , and I was , as you said , inhospitable . You must permit me to repair my fault . "
6083	6091	6093	6093	he	97	" You may enjoy this without fear , "
6097	6165	6093	6093	he	97	" it will do you good . It is an Eastern wine , unknown to trade , and therefore untampered with . I see you are looking at the rose - leaves on the surface . That is a Persian custom , and I think a pretty one . They float away from your lips in the action of drinking , and therefore they are no obstacle . "
6231	6242	6244	6244	Cellini	97	" Leo has made friends with you , I see , "
6246	6290	6244	6244	Cellini	97	" You should take that as a great compliment , for he is most particular in his choice of acquaintance , and most steadfast when he has once made up his mind . He has more decision of character than many a statesman . "
6291	6302	6303	6303	I	0	" How is it we have never seen him before ? "
6306	6318	6303	6303	I	0	" You never told us you had such a splendid companion . "
6319	6326	6328	6329	the artist	348	" I am not his master , "
6331	6389	6328	6329	the artist	348	" He only favours me with a visit occasionally . He arrived from Paris last night , and came straight here , sure of his welcome . He does not confide his plans to me , but I suppose he will return to his home when he thinks it advisable . He knows his own business best . "
6393	6412	6244	6244	Cellini	97	" What a clever dog ! Does he journey on foot , or does he take the train ? "
6413	6511	6303	6303	I	0	" I believe he generally patronizes the railway . All the officials know him , and he gets into the guard 's van as a matter of course . Sometimes he will alight at a station en route , and walk the rest of the way . But if he is lazily inclined , he does not stir till the train reaches its destination . At the end of every six months or so , the railway authorities send the bill of Leo 's journeyings in to his master , when it is always settled without difficulty . "
6512	6519	6520	6520	I	0	" And who IS his master ? "
6545	6673	6675	6675	he	388	" His master , mademoiselle , is MY master - one who among men , is supremely intelligent ; among teachers , absolutely unselfish ; among thinkers , purely impersonal ; among friends , inflexibly faithful . To him I owe everything - even life itself . For him no sacrifice , no extreme devotion would be too great , could I hope thereby to show my gratitude . But he is as far above human thanks or human rewards as the sun is above the sea . Not here , not now , dare I say to him , MY FRIEND , BEHOLD HOW MUCH I LOVE THEE ! such language would be all too poor and unmeaning ; but hereafter - who knows ? - - "
6706	6742	6699	6699	he	388	" But , mademoiselle , I am wasting your time , and am taking no advantage of the favour you have shown me by your presence to - day . Will you seat yourself here ? "
6763	6774	6775	6775	he	388	" I should be sorry to fatigue you at all , "
6779	6786	6775	6775	he	388	" do you care for reading ? "

6928	6948	6925	6925	I	0	" Do you really consider it enviable , Signor Cellini , to receive the world 's ridicule and contempt ? "

7431	7583	7428	7428	he	388	" Music , thou Sweetest Spirit of all that serve God , what have I done that thou shouldst so often visit me ? It is not well , O thou Lofty and Divine One , that thou shouldst stoop so low as to console him who is the unworthiest of all thy servants . For I am too feeble to tell the world how soft is the sound of thy rustling pinions , how tender is the sighing breath of thy lips , how beyond all things glorious is the vibration of thy lightest whisper ! Remain aloft , thou Choicest Essence of the Creator 's Voice , remain in that pure and cloudless ether , where alone thou art fitted to dwell . My touch must desecrate thee , my voice affright thee . Suffice it to thy servant , O Beloved , to dream of thee and die ! "
7598	7610	7595	7595	I	0	" Did you know the author of this book , signor ? "
7611	7617	7618	7618	he	402	" I knew him well , "
7621	7674	7618	7618	he	402	" he was one of the gentlest souls that ever dwelt in human clay . As ethereal in his music as John Keats in his poetry , he was one of those creatures born of dreams and rapture that rarely visit this planet . Happy fellow ! What a death was his ! "
7675	7681	7682	7682	I	0	" How did he die ? "
7685	7725	7618	7618	he	402	" He was playing the organ in one of the great churches of Rome on the day of the Feast of the Virgin . A choir of finely trained voices sang to his accompaniment his own glorious setting of the "
7729	7888	7618	7618	he	402	" The music was wonderful , startling , triumphant - ever rising in power and majesty to a magnificent finale , when suddenly a slight crash was heard ; the organ ceased abruptly , the singers broke off . The musician was dead . He had fallen forward on the keys of the instrument , and when they raised him , his face was fairer than the face of any sculptured angel , so serene was its expression , so rapt was its smile . No one could tell exactly the cause of his death - he had always been remarkably strong and healthy . Everyone said it was heart - disease - it is the usual reason assigned by medical savants for these sudden departures out of the world . His loss was regretted by all , save myself and one other who loved him . We rejoiced , and still do rejoice , at his release . "

A majestic invisible Protectorate governs the winds , the tides , the incoming and outgoing of the seasons , the birth of the flowers , the growth of forests , the outpourings of the sunlight , the silent glittering of the stars . A wide illimitable Beneficence embraces all creation . A vast Eternal Pity exists for all sorrow , all sin . He who first swung the planets in the air , and bade them revolve till Time shall be no more - He , the Fountain - Head of Absolute Perfection , is no deaf , blind , capricious , or remorseless Being . To Him the death of the smallest singing - bird is as great or as little as the death of a world 's emperor . For Him the timeless withering of an innocent flower is as pitiful as the decay of a mighty nation . An infant 's first prayer to Him is heard with as tender a patience as the united petitions of thousands of worshippers . For in everything and around everything , from the sun to a grain of sand , He hath a portion , small or great , of His own most Perfect Existence . Should He hate His Creation , He must perforce hate Himself ; and that Love should hate Love is an impossibility . Therefore He loves all His work ; and as Love , to be perfect , must contain Pity , Forgiveness , and Forbearance , so doth He pity , forgive , and forbear . Shall a mere man deny himself for the sake of his child or friend ? and shall the Infinite Love refuse to sacrifice itself - yea , even to as immense a humility as its greatness is immeasurable ? Shall we deny those merciful attributes to God which we acknowledge in His creature , Man ? O my Soul , rejoice that thou hast pierced the veil of the Beyond ; that thou hast seen and known the Truth ! that to thee is made clear the Reason of Life , and the Recompense of Death : yet while rejoicing , grieve that thou art not fated to draw more than a few souls to the comfort thou hast thyself attained !

11066	11074	11062	11062	she	365	" perhaps you 've got the fever ? "
11075	11082	11083	11083	I	0	" I do n't think so , "
11098	11105	11106	11106	she	365	" No , you have n't , "
11112	11152	11106	11106	she	365	" your palm is moist and cool , and your pulse is regular . Well , you look spry , anyhow . I should n't wonder if you made up your mind to have a dance to - night . "
11153	11156	11157	11157	I	0	" Dance ? "
11160	11167	11106	11106	she	365	" What dance , and where ? "
11168	11197	11106	11106	she	365	" Well , Madame Didier , that jolly little furbelowed Frenchwoman with whom I was driving just now , has got up a regular party to - night - "
11198	11205	11206	11206	I	0	" Hans Breitmann gib a barty ? "
11220	11343	11217	11217	Amy	93	" Well , yes , it MAY be that kind of thing , for all I know to the contrary . Anyhow , she 's hired the band and ordered a right - down elegant supper . Half the folks in the hotel are going , and a lot of outsiders have got invitations . She asked if we could n't come - myself , the Colonel , and you . I said I could answer for myself and the Colonel , but not for you , as you were an invalid . But if you keep on looking as you do at present , no one will believe that there 's anything the matter with you . - Tea , Alphonse ! "
11366	11369	11217	11217	Amy	93	" madame 's "
11514	11518	11520	11520	Amy	93	" There now ! "
11542	11592	11527	11527	I	0	" Did I not tell you so ? The change in you is marvellous ! I know what it is . You have been getting better unconsciously to yourself in this lovely air and scene , and the long afternoon sleep you 've just had has completed the cure . "
11732	11747	11729	11729	I	0	" Shall I take a pencil and write it down lest I forget it ? "
11753	11756	11729	11729	I	0	" No . "
11783	11788	11789	11789	she	93	" Say , child ! "
11792	11800	11789	11789	she	93	" will you go to the dance ? "
11801	11809	11810	11810	I	0	" Certainly I will , with pleasure , "
11825	11906	11908	11908	her	93	" Brava ! It will be real fun . There are no end of foreign titles coming , I believe . The Colonel 's a bit grumpy about it , - he always is when he has to wear his dress suit . He just hates it . That man has n't a particle of vanity . He looks handsomer in his evening clothes than in anything else , and yet he does n't see it . But tell me , "
11919	11935	11908	11908	her	93	" whatever will you wear ? You 've brought no ball fixings , have you ? "
11993	12058	11990	11990	I	0	" No , dear ; I certainly have no regular ball ' fixings , ' for I never expected to dance here , or anywhere for that matter . I did not bring the big trunks full of Parisian toilettes that you indulge in , you spoilt bride ! Still I have something that may do . In fact it will have to do . "
12059	12072	12074	12074	her	93	" What is it ? Have I seen it ? Do show ! "
12092	12095	12096	12096	I	0	" Entrez ! "
12141	12145	12146	12146	he	109	" For mademoiselle , "
12231	12262	12224	12224	Cellini	97	" If mademoiselle will be so good as to refrain from choosing any flowers for her toilette this evening , she will confer a favour on her humble friend and servant ,
12263	12267	12302	12302	she	93	" RAFFAELLO CELLINI . "
12285	12297	12298	12298	she	93	" Did n't I say he was a queer young man ? "
12308	12390	12302	12302	she	93	" This is only his way of saying that he means to send you some flowers himself . But what puzzles me is to think how he could possibly know you were going to make any special ' toilette ' this evening . It is really very mysterious when I come to think of it , for Madame Didier said plainly that she would not ask Cellini to the dance till she saw him at the table d'hote to - night . "
12391	12401	12402	12402	I	0	" Perhaps Alphonse has told him all about it , "
12411	12468	12405	12406	My friend	365	" Of course ! That is it ; and Mr. Cellini takes it for granted that a girl of your age would not be likely to refuse a dance . Still there is something odd about it , too . By - the - bye , I forgot to ask you how the picture got on ? "
12469	12478	12479	12479	I	0	" Oh , very well , I believe , "
12483	12496	12479	12479	I	0	" Signor Cellini only made a slight outline sketch as a beginning . "
12497	12510	12405	12406	My friend	365	" And was it like you ? - a really good resemblance ? "
12511	12526	12479	12479	I	0	" I really did not examine it closely enough to be able to judge . "
12527	12536	12538	12539	Mrs. Everard	93	" What a demure young person you are ! "
12541	12604	12538	12539	Mrs. Everard	93	" Now , I should have rushed straight up to the easel and examined every line of what he was doing . You are a model of discretion , really ! I sha n't be anxious about leaving you alone any more . But about your dress for to - night . Let me see it , there 's a good girl . "
12652	12685	12687	12687	she	93	" Now , you would have looked perfectly ghastly in this last night , when you were as pale and hollow - eyed as a sick nun ; but to - night , "
12695	12711	12687	12687	she	93	" I believe you will do . Do n't you want the bodice cut lower ? "
12712	12717	12718	12718	I	0	" No , thanks ! "
12723	12747	12718	12718	I	0	" I will leave that to the portly dowagers - they will expose neck enough for half - a - dozen other women . "
12752	12758	12759	12759	she	93	" Do as you like , "
12762	12809	12759	12759	she	93	" only I see your gown has short sleeves , and I thought you might like a square neck instead of that little simple Greek round . But perhaps it 's better as it is . The stuff is lovely ; where did you get it ? "
12810	12821	12822	12822	I	0	" At one of the London emporiums of Eastern art , "
12825	12835	12822	12822	I	0	" My dear , your tea is getting cold . "
12865	12870	12871	12871	she	93	" What 's this ? "

12902	12907	12908	12908	I	0	" Not at all , "
12926	12954	12912	12912	I	0	" It is a very scholarly , poetical , and picturesque work . Signor Cellini lent it to me ; the author was a friend of his . "

13043	13062	13036	13036	I	0	" Why , my dear , Raffaello Cellini is betrothed , and he is a most devoted lover . "
13164	13167	13168	13168	she	93	" Really ! "
13171	13243	13168	13168	she	93	" it makes him a more romantic character than ever ! Fancy his telling you that he was betrothed ! How delightful ! I must ask him all about his chosen fair one . But I 'm positively thankful it is n't you , for I 'm sure he 's just a little bit off his head . Even this book he has lent you looks like a wizard 's property ; "

Thrones , principalities , and powers are among them , yet all are equal . Each one has a different duty to perform , yet all their labours are lofty . But what a fate is ours on this low earth !

17432	17752	17426	17426	his	97	" Mademoiselle , I am one of those strangely constituted beings who can not bear to see any innocent thing suffer . It matters not whether it be a worm in the dust , a butterfly in the air , a bird , a flower , or a human creature . The first time I saw you I knew that your state of health precluded you from the enjoyment of life natural to your sex and age . I also perceived that the physicians had been at work upon you trying to probe into the causes of your ailment , and that they had signally failed . Physicians , mademoiselle , are very clever and estimable men , and there are a few things which come within the limit of their treatment ; but there are also other things which baffle their utmost profundity of knowledge . One of these is that wondrous piece of human machinery , the nervous system ; that intricate and delicate network of fine threads - electric wires on which run the messages of thought , impulse , affection , emotion . If these threads or wires become , from any subtle cause , entangled , the skill of the mere medical practitioner is of no avail to undo the injurious knot , or to unravel the confused skein . The drugs generally used in such cases are , for the most part , repellent to the human blood and natural instinct , therefore they are always dangerous , and often deadly . I knew , by studying your face , mademoiselle , that you were suffering as acutely as I , too , suffered some five years ago , and I ventured to try upon you a simple vegetable essence , merely to see if you were capable of benefiting by it . The experiment has been so far successful ; but - - "

17785	17819	17782	17782	he	518	" that the effect is only transitory . Within forty - eight hours you must naturally relapse into your former prostrate condition , and I , unfortunately , am powerless to prevent it . "
17851	17862	17863	17863	I	0	" You can give me another dose of your remedy , "
17866	17874	17875	17875	he	518	" That I can not , mademoiselle , "
17879	17890	17875	17875	he	518	" I dare not , without further advice and guidance . "
17891	17898	17899	17899	I	0	" Advice and guidance from whom ? "
17902	17917	17919	17919	Cellini	97	" From the friend who cured me of my long and almost hopeless illness , "
17921	17940	17919	17919	Cellini	97	" He alone can tell me whether I am right in my theories respecting your nature and constitution . "
17941	17948	17949	17949	I	0	" And what are those theories ? "
17988	18460	17981	17981	he	97	" In this world , mademoiselle , there are no two natures alike , yet all are born with a small portion of Divinity within them , which we call the Soul . It is a mere spark smouldering in the centre of the weight of clay with which we are encumbered , yet it is there . Now this particular germ or seed can be cultivated if we will - that is , if we desire and insist on its growth . As a child 's taste for art or learning can be educated into high capabilities for the future , so can the human Soul be educated into so high , so supreme an attainment , that no merely mortal standard of measurement can reach its magnificence . With much more than half the inhabitants of the globe , this germ of immortality remains always a germ , never sprouting , overlaid and weighted down by the lymphatic laziness and materialistic propensities of its shell or husk - the body . But I must put aside the forlorn prospect of the multitudes in whom the Divine Essence attains to no larger quantity than that proportioned out to a dog or bird - I have only to speak of the rare few with whom the soul is everything - those who , perceiving and admitting its existence within them , devote all their powers to fanning up their spark of light till it becomes a radiant , burning , inextinguishable flame . The mistake made by these examples of beatified Humanity is that they too often sacrifice the body to the demands of the spirit . It is difficult to find the medium path , but it can be found ; and the claims of both body and soul can be satisfied without sacrificing the one to the other . I beg your earnest attention , mademoiselle , for what I say concerning THE RARE FEW WITH WHOM THE SOUL IS EVERYTHING . YOU are one of those few , unless I am greatly in error . And you have sacrificed your body so utterly to your spirit that the flesh rebels and suffers . This will not do . You have work before you in the world , and you can not perform it unless you have bodily health as well as spiritual desire . And why ? Because you are a prisoner here on earth , and you must obey the laws of the prison , however unpleasant they may be to you . Were you free as you have been in ages past and as you will be in ages to come , things would be different ; but at present you must comply with the orders of your gaolers - the Lords of Life and Death . "
18479	18492	18493	18493	I	0	" How do you know I am of the temperament you describe ? "
18500	18608	18610	18610	he	520	" I do not know , mademoiselle ; I can only guess . There is but one person who can perhaps judge of you correctly , - a man older than myself by many years - whose life is the very acme of spiritual perfection - whose learning is vast and unprejudiced . I must see and speak to him before I try any more of my , or rather his , remedies . But we have lingered long enough out here , and unless you have something more to say to me , we will return to the ballroom . You will otherwise miss the cotillon ; "
18657	18673	18651	18651	I	0	" This friend of yours that you speak of - is not his name HELIOBAS ? "
18735	18794	18723	18723	he	97	" Mademoiselle , I see that you must know all . It is your fate . You are greatly to be envied . Come to me to - morrow , and I will tell you everything that is to be told . Afterwards your destiny rests in your own hands . Ask nothing more of me just now . "
18853	18869	18849	18849	I	0	" Good - night , signor . To - morrow at noon I will come . "
18873	18891	18870	18870	He	97	" Good - night , mademoiselle ! To - morrow at noon you will find me ready . "
19224	19229	19230	19230	I	0	" Where is Leo ? "
19246	19254	19256	19256	Cellini	97	" Leo left for Paris last night , "
19258	19278	19256	19256	Cellini	97	" he carried an important despatch for me , which I feared to trust to the post - office . "
19279	19288	19289	19289	I	0	" Is it safer in Leo 's charge ? "
19307	19401	19289	19289	I	0	" Much safer ! Leo carries on his collar a small tin case , just large enough to contain several folded sheets of paper . When he knows he has that box to guard during his journeys , he is simply unapproachable . He would fight any one who attempted to touch it with the ferocity of a hungry tiger , and there is no edible dainty yet invented that could tempt his appetite or coax him into any momentary oblivion of his duty . There is no more trustworthy or faithful messenger . "
19402	19416	19417	19417	I	0	" I suppose you have sent him to your friend - his master , "
19420	19432	19289	19289	I	0	" Yes . He has gone straight home to - Heliobas . "
19502	19512	19499	19499	he	97	" Shall I tell you everything now , mademoiselle ? "
19519	19524	19525	19525	I	0	" If you please , "
19528	19536	19499	19499	he	97	" May I ask you one question ? "
19537	19540	19499	19499	he	97	" Certainly . "
19541	19553	19499	19499	he	97	" How and where did you hear the name of Heliobas ? "
19559	19583	19554	19554	I	0	" In a dream , signor , strange to say ; or rather in three dreams . I will relate them to you . "
19627	19711	19624	19624	he	348	" The elixir I gave you acted more potently than even I imagined it would . You are more sensitive than I thought . Do not fatigue yourself any more , mademoiselle , by talking . With your permission I will sit down here opposite to you and tell you my story . Afterwards you must decide for yourself whether you will adopt the method of treatment to which I owe my life , and something more than my life - my reason . "
19831	20673	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" You must be aware , mademoiselle , that those who adopt any art as a means of livelihood begin the world heavily handicapped - weighted down , as it were , in the race for fortune . The following of art is a very different thing to the following of trade or mercantile business . In buying or selling , in undertaking the work of import or export , a good head for figures , and an average quantity of shrewd common sense , are all that is necessary in order to win a fair share of success . But in the finer occupations , whose results are found in sculpture , painting , music and poetry , demands are made upon the imagination , the emotions , the entire spiritual susceptibility of man . The most delicate fibres of the brain are taxed ; the subtle inner workings of thought are brought into active play ; and the temperament becomes daily and hourly more finely strung , more sensitive , more keenly alive to every passing sensation . Of course there are many so - called ' ARTISTS ' who are mere shams of the real thing ; persons who , having a little surface - education in one or the other branch of the arts , play idly with the paint - brush , or dabble carelessly in the deep waters of literature , - or borrow a few crotchets and quavers from other composers , and putting them together in haste , call it ORIGINAL COMPOSITION . Among these are to be found the self - called ' professors ' of painting ; the sculptors who allow the work of their ' ghosts ' to be admired as their own ; the magazine - scribblers ; the ' smart ' young leader - writers and critics ; the half - hearted performers on piano or violin who object to any innovation , and prefer to grind on in the unemotional , coldly correct manner which they are pleased to term the ' classical ' - such persons exist , and will exist , so long as good and evil are leading forces of life . They are the aphides on the rose of art . But the men and women I speak of as ARTISTS are those who work day and night to attain even a small degree of perfection , and who are never satisfied with their own best efforts . I was one of these some years ago , and I humbly assert myself still to be of the same disposition ; only the difference between myself then and myself now is , that THEN I struggled blindly and despairingly , and NOW I labour patiently and with calmness , knowing positively that I shall obtain what I seek at the duly appointed hour . I was educated as a painter , mademoiselle , by my father , a good , simple - hearted man , whose little landscapes looked like bits cut out of the actual field and woodland , so fresh and pure were they . But I was not content to follow in the plain path he first taught me to tread . Merely correct drawing , merely correct colouring , were not sufficient for my ambition . I had dazzled my eyes with the loveliness of Correggio 's ' Madonna , ' and had marvelled at the wondrous blue of her robe - a blue so deep and intense that I used to think one might scrape away the paint till a hole was bored in the canvas and yet not reach the end of that fathomless azure tint ; I had studied the warm hues of Titian ; I had felt ready to float away in the air with the marvellous ' Angel of the Annunciation ' - and with all these thoughts in me , how could I content myself with the ordinary aspiration of modern artists ? I grew absorbed in one subject - Colour . I noted how lifeless and pale the colouring of to - day appeared beside that of the old masters , and I meditated deeply on the problem thus presented to me . What was the secret of Correggio - of Fra Angelico - of Raphael ? I tried various experiments ; I bought the most expensive and highly guaranteed pigments . In vain , for they were all adulterated by the dealers ! Then I obtained colours in the rough , and ground and mixed them myself ; still , though a little better result was obtained , I found trade adulteration still at work with the oils , the varnishes , the mediums - in fact , with everything that painters use to gain effect in their works . I could nowhere escape from vicious dealers , who , to gain a miserable percentage on every article sold , are content to be among the most dishonest men in this dishonest age .
20674	21217	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" I assure you , mademoiselle , that not one of the pictures which are now being painted for the salons of Paris and London can possibly last a hundred years . I recently visited that Palace of Art , the South Kensington Museum , in London , and saw there a large fresco by Sir Frederick Leighton . It had just been completed , I was informed . It was already fading ! Within a few years it will be a blur of indistinct outlines . I compared its condition with the cartoons of Raphael , and a superb Giorgione in the same building ; these were as warm and bright as though recently painted . It is not Leighton 's fault that his works are doomed to perish as completely off the canvas as though he had never traced them ; it is his dire misfortune , and that of every other nineteenth - century painter , thanks to the magnificent institution of free trade , which has resulted in a vulgar competition of all countries and all classes to see which can most quickly jostle the other out of existence . But I am wearying you , mademoiselle - pardon me ! To resume my own story . As I told you , I could think of nothing but the one subject of Colour ; it haunted me incessantly . I saw in my dreams visions , of exquisite forms and faces that I longed to transfer to my canvas , but I could never succeed in the attempt . My hand seemed to have lost all skill . About this time my father died , and I , having no other relation in the world , and no ties of home to cling to , lived in utter solitude , and tortured my brain more and more with the one question that baffled and perplexed me . I became moody and irritable ; I avoided intercourse with everyone , and at last sleep forsook my eyes . Then came a terrible season of feverish trouble , nervous dejection and despair . At times I would sit silently brooding ; at others I started up and walked rapidly for hours , in the hope to calm the wild unrest that took possession of my brain . I was then living in Rome , in the studio that had been my father 's . One evening - how well I remember it ! - I was attacked by one of those fierce impulses that forbade me to rest or think or sleep , and , as usual , I hurried out for one of those long aimless excursions I had latterly grown accustomed to . At the open street - door stood the proprietress of the house , a stout , good - natured contadina , with her youngest child Pippa holding to her skirt . As she saw me approaching , she started back with an exclamation of alarm , and catching the little girl up in her arms , she made the sign of the cross rapidly . Astonished at this , I paused in my hasty walk , and said with as much calmness as I could muster :
21218	21237	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" ' What do you mean by that ? Have I the evil - eye , think you ? '
21238	21280	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" Curly - haired Pippa stretched out her arms to me - I had often caressed the little one , and given her sweetmeats and toys - but her mother held her back with a sort of smothered scream , and muttered :
21281	21296	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" ' Holy Virgin ! Pippa must not touch him ; he is mad . '
21297	21502	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" Mad ? I looked at the woman and child in scornful amazement . Then without further words I turned , and went swiftly away down the street out of their sight . Mad ! Was I indeed losing my reason ? Was this the terrific meaning of my sleepless nights , my troubled thoughts , my strange inquietude ? Fiercely I strode along , heedless whither I was going , till I found myself suddenly on the borders of the desolate Campagna . A young moon gleamed aloft , looking like a slender sickle thrust into the heavens to reap an over - abundant harvest of stars . I paused irresolutely . There was a deep silence everywhere . I felt faint and giddy : curious flashes of light danced past my eyes , and my limbs shook like those of a palsied old man . I sank upon a stone to rest , to try and arrange my scattered ideas into some sort of connection and order . Mad ! I clasped my aching head between my hands , and brooded on the fearful prospect looming before me , and in the words of poor King Lear , I prayed in my heart :
21503	21518	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" ' O let me not be mad , not mad , sweet heavens ! '
21519	22092	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" PRAYER ! There was another thought . How could I pray ? For I was a sceptic . My father had educated me with broadly materialistic views ; he himself was a follower of Voltaire , and with his finite rod he took the measure of Divinity , greatly to his own satisfaction . He was a good man , too , and he died with exemplary calmness in the absolute certainty of there being nothing in his composition but dust , to which he was as bound to return . He had not a shred of belief in anything but what he called the Universal Law of Necessity ; perhaps this was why all his pictures lacked inspiration . I accepted his theories without thinking much about them , and I had managed to live respectably without any religious belief . But NOW - now with the horrible phantom of madness rising before me - my firm nerves quailed . I tried , I longed to PRAY . Yet to whom ? To what ? To the Universal Law of Necessity ? In that there could be no hearing or answering of human petitions . I meditated on this with a kind of sombre ferocity . Who portioned out this Law of Necessity ? What brutal Code compels us to be born , to live , to suffer , and to die without recompense or reason ? Why should this Universe be an ever - circling Wheel of Torture ? Then a fresh impetus came to me . I rose from my recumbent posture and stood erect ; I trembled no more . A curious sensation of defiant amusement possessed me so violently that I laughed aloud . Such a laugh , too ! I recoiled from the sound , as from a blow , with a shudder . It was the laugh of - a madman ! I thought no more ; I was resolved . I would fulfil the grim Law of Necessity to its letter . If Necessity caused my birth , it also demanded my death . Necessity could not force me to live against my will . Better eternal nothingness than madness . Slowly and deliberately I took from my vest a Milanese dagger of thin sharp steel - one that I always carried with me as a means of self - defence - I drew it from its sheath , and looked at the fine edge glittering coldly in the pallid moon - rays . I kissed it joyously ; it was my final remedy ! I poised it aloft with firm fingers - another instant and it would have been buried deep in my heart , when I felt a powerful grasp on my wrist , and a strong arm struggling with mine forced the dagger from my hand . Savagely angry at being thus foiled in my desperate intent , I staggered back a few paces and sullenly stared at my rescuer . He was a tall man , clad in a dark overcoat bordered with fur ; he looked like a wealthy Englishman or American travelling for pleasure . His features were fine and commanding ; his eyes gleamed with a gentle disdain as he coolly met my resentful gaze . When he spoke his voice was rich and mellifluous , though his accents had a touch in them of grave scorn .
22093	22255	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" ' So you are tired of your life , young man ! All the more reason have you to live . Anyone can die . A murderer has moral force enough to jeer at his hangman . It is very easy to draw the last breath . It can be accomplished successfully by a child or a warrior . One pang of far less anguish than the toothache , and all is over . There is nothing heroic about it , I assure you ! It is as common as going to bed ; it is almost prosy . LIFE is heroism , if you like ; but death is a mere cessation of business . And to make a rapid and rude exit off the stage before the prompter gives the sign is always , to say the least of it , ungraceful . Act the part out , no matter how bad the play . What say you ? '
22256	22300	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" And , balancing the dagger lightly on one finger , as though it were a paper - knife , he smiled at me with so much frank kindliness that it was impossible to resist him . I advanced and held out my hand .
22301	22362	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" ' Whoever you are , ' I said , ' you speak like a true man . But you are ignorant of the causes which compelled me to - - ' and a hard sob choked my utterance . My new acquaintance pressed my proffered hand cordially , but the gravity of his tone did not vary as he replied :
22363	22390	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" ' There is no cause , my friend , which compels us to take violent leave of existence , unless it be madness or cowardice . '
22391	22425	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" ' Aye , and what if it were madness ? ' I asked him eagerly . He scanned me attentively , and laying his fingers lightly on my wrist , felt my pulse .
22426	22490	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" ' Pooh , my dear sir ! ' he said ; ' you are no more mad than I am . You are a little overwrought and excited - that I admit . You have some mental worry that consumes you . You shall tell me all about it . I have no doubt I can cure you in a few days . '
22491	22503	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" Cure me ? I looked at him in wonderment and doubt .
22504	22514	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" ' Are you a physician ? ' I asked .
22515	22627	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" He laughed . ' Not I ! I should be sorry to belong to the profession . Yet I administer medicines and give advice in certain cases . I am simply a remedial agent - not a doctor . But why do we stand here in this bleak place , which must be peopled by the ghosts of olden heroes ? Come with me , will you ? I am going to the Hotel Costanza , and we can talk there . As for this pretty toy , permit me to return it to you . You will not force it again to the unpleasant task of despatching its owner . '
22628	22670	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" And he handed the dagger back to me with a slight bow . I sheathed it at once , feeling somewhat like a chidden child , as I met the slightly satirical gleam of the clear blue eyes that watched me .
22671	22695	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" ' Will you give me your name , signor ? ' I asked , as we turned from the Campagna towards the city .
22696	22769	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" ' With pleasure . I am called Heliobas . A strange name ? Oh , not at all ! It is pure Chaldee . My mother - as lovely an Eastern houri as Murillo 's Madonna , and as devout as Santa Teresa - gave me the Christian saint 's name of Casimir also , but Heliobas pur et simple suits me best , and by it I am generally known . '
22770	22780	19819	19819	Cellini	97	" ' You are a Chaldean ? ' I inquired .
22781	22794	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" ' Exactly so . I am descended directly from one of those "
22800	22881	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" and , by the way , there were more than three , and they were not all kings , who , being wide awake , happened to notice the birth - star of Christ on the horizon before the rest of the world 's inhabitants had so much as rubbed their sleepy eyes . The Chaldeans have been always quick of observation from time immemorial . But in return for my name , you will favour me with yours ? '
22882	22919	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" I gave it readily , and we walked on together . I felt wonderfully calmed and cheered - as soothed , mademoiselle , as I have noticed you yourself have felt when in MY company . "
22954	23102	22950	22950	He	97	" We reached the Hotel Costanza , where Heliobas was evidently well known . The waiters addressed him as Monsieur le Comte ; but he gave me no information as to this title . He had a superb suite of rooms in the hotel , furnished with every modern luxury ; and as soon as we entered a light supper was served . He invited me to partake , and within the space of half an hour I had told him all my history - my ambition - my strivings after the perfection of colour - my disappointment , dejection , and despair - and , finally , the fearful dread of coming madness that had driven me to attempt my own life . He listened patiently and with unbroken attention . When I had finished , he laid one hand on my shoulder , and said gently :
23103	23128	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" ' Young man , pardon me if I say that up to the present your career has been an inactive , useless , selfish "
23134	23249	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" as St. Paul says . You set before yourself a task of noble effort , namely , to discover the secret of colouring as known to the old masters ; and because you meet with the petty difficulty of modern trade adulteration in your materials , you think that there is no chance - that all is lost . Fie ! Do you think Nature is overcome by a few dishonest traders ? She can still give you in abundance the unspoilt colours she gave to Raphael and Titian ; but not in haste - not if you vulgarly scramble for her gifts in a mood that is impatient of obstacle and delay . "
23256	23339	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" is the motto of the stars . Learn it well . You have injured your bodily health by useless fretfulness and peevish discontent , and with that we have first to deal . In a week 's time , I will make a sound , sane man of you ; and then I will teach you how to get the colours you seek - yes ! ' he added , smiling , ' even to the compassing of Correggio 's blue . '
23340	23403	23512	23512	Cellini	97	" I could not speak for joy and gratitude ; I grasped my friend and preserver by the hand . We stood thus together for a brief interval , when suddenly Heliobas drew himself up to the full stateliness of his height and bent his calm eyes deliberately upon me . A strange thrill ran through me ; I still held his hand .
23404	23467	22921	22921	Cellini	97	" ' Rest ! ' he said in slow and emphatic tones , ' Weary and overwrought frame , take thy full and needful measure of repose ! Struggling and deeply injured spirit , be free of thy narrow prison ! By that Force which I acknowledge within me and thee and in all created things , I command thee , REST ! '
23468	23511	23512	23512	Cellini	97	" Fascinated , awed , overcome by his manner , I gazed at him and would have spoken , but my tongue refused its office - my senses swam - my eyes closed - my limbs gave way - I fell senseless . "
23535	23655	23531	23531	He	97	" When I say senseless , mademoiselle , I allude of course to my body . But I , myself - that is , my soul - was conscious ; I lived , I moved , I heard , I saw . Of that experience I am forbidden to speak . When I returned to mortal existence I found myself lying on a couch in the same room where I had supped with Heliobas , and Heliobas himself sat near me reading . It was broad noonday . A delicious sense of tranquillity and youthful buoyancy was upon me , and without speaking I sprang up from my recumbent position and touched him on the arm . He looked up .
23656	23668	23531	23531	He	97	" ' Well ? ' he asked , and his eyes smiled .
23669	23682	23531	23531	He	97	" I seized his hand , and pressed it reverently to my lips .
23683	23711	23531	23531	He	97	" ' My best friend ! ' I exclaimed . ' What wonders have I not seen - what truths have I not learned - what mysteries ! '
23712	23804	23531	23531	He	97	" ' On all these things be silent , ' replied Heliobas . ' They must not be lightly spoken of . And of the questions you naturally desire to ask me , you shall have the answers in due time . What has happened to you is not wonderful ; you have simply been acted upon by scientific means . But your cure is not yet complete . A few days more passed with me will restore you thoroughly . Will you consent to remain so long in my company ? '
23805	23930	23531	23531	He	97	" Gladly and gratefully I consented , and we spent the next ten days together , during which Heliobas administered to me certain remedies , external and internal , which had a marvellous effect in renovating and invigorating my system . By the expiration of that time I was strong and well - a sound and sane man , as my rescuer had promised I should be - my brain was fresh and eager for work , and my mind was filled with new and grand ideas of art . And I had gained through Heliobas two inestimable things - a full comprehension of the truth of religion , and the secret of human destiny ; and I had won a LOVE so exquisite ! "
23953	23991	23947	23947	He	97	" Yes , mademoiselle , I discovered that I was loved , and watched over and guided by ONE so divinely beautiful , so gloriously faithful , that mortal language fails before the description of such perfection ! "
24000	24142	23992	23992	He	97	" When he found me perfectly healthy again in mind and body , Heliobas showed me his art of mixing colours . From that hour all my works were successful . You know that my pictures are eagerly purchased as soon as completed , and that the colour I obtain in them is to the world a mystery almost magical . Yet there is not one among the humblest of artists who could not , if he chose , make use of the same means as I have done to gain the nearly imperishable hues that still glow on the canvases of Raphael . But of this there is no need to speak just now . I have told you my story , mademoiselle , and it now rests with me to apply its meaning to yourself . You are attending ? "
24143	24146	24147	24147	I	0	" Perfectly , "
24177	24548	24174	24174	Cellini	97	" Electricity , mademoiselle , is , as you are aware , the wonder of our age . No end can be foreseen to the marvels it is capable of accomplishing . But one of the most important branches of this great science is ignorantly derided just now by the larger portion of society - I mean the use of human electricity ; that force which is in each one of us - in you and in me - and , to a very large extent , in Heliobas . He has cultivated the electricity in his own system to such an extent that his mere touch , his lightest glance , have healing in them , or the reverse , as he chooses to exert his power - I may say it is never the reverse , for he is full of kindness , sympathy , and pity for all humanity . His influence is so great that he can , without speaking , by his mere presence suggest his own thoughts to other people who are perfect strangers , and cause them to design and carry out certain actions in accordance with his plans . You are incredulous ? Mademoiselle , this power is in every one of us ; only we do not cultivate it , because our education is yet so imperfect . To prove the truth of what I say , I , though I have only advanced a little way in the cultivation of my own electric force , even I have influenced YOU . You can not deny it . By my thought , impelled to you , you saw clearly my picture that was actually veiled . By MY force , you replied correctly to a question I asked you concerning that same picture . By MY desire , you gave me , without being aware of it , a message from one I love when you said , ' Dieu vous garde ! ' You remember ? And the elixir I gave you , which is one of the simplest remedies discovered by Heliobas , had the effect of making you learn what he intended you to learn - his name . "
24549	24552	24553	24553	I	0	" He ! "
24556	24573	24553	24553	I	0	" Why , he does not know me - he can have no intentions towards me ! "
24574	24577	24579	24579	Cellini	97	" Mademoiselle , "
24582	24769	24579	24579	Cellini	97	" if you will think again of the last of your three dreams , you will not doubt that he HAS intentions towards you . As I told you , he is a PHYSICAL ELECTRICIAN . By that is meant a great deal . He knows by instinct whether he is or will be needed sooner or later . Let me finish what I have to say . You are ill , mademoiselle - ill from over - work . You are an improvisatrice - that is , you have the emotional genius of music , a spiritual thing unfettered by rules , and utterly misunderstood by the world . You cultivate this faculty , regardless of cost ; you suffer , and you will suffer more . In proportion as your powers in music grow , so will your health decline . Go to Heliobas ; he will do for you what he did for me . Surely you will not hesitate ? Between years of weak invalidism and perfect health , in less than a fortnight , there can be no question of choice . "
24777	24783	24784	24784	I	0	" Where is this Heliobas ? "
24787	24791	24784	24784	I	0	" In Paris ? "
24792	24850	24869	24869	his	540	" Yes , in Paris . If you decide to go there , take my advice , and go alone . You can easily make some excuse to your friends . I will give you the address of a ladies ' Pension , where you will be made at home and comfortable . May I do this ? "
24851	24856	24857	24857	I	0	" If you please , "
24872	24876	24869	24869	his	540	" MADAME DENISE , "
24883	24886	24860	24860	He	540	" Paris , "
25129	25134	25135	25135	he	97	" Will you go ? "
25140	25147	25148	25148	I	0	" Yes ; I will go , "
25151	25163	25148	25148	I	0	" But will you give me a letter to your friend ? "
25164	25175	25177	25177	Cellini	97	" Leo has taken it and all necessary explanations already , "
25181	25226	25177	25177	Cellini	97	" I knew you would go . Heliobas expects you the day after to - morrow . His residence is Hotel Mars , Champs Elysees . You are not angry with me , mademoiselle ? I could not help knowing that you would go . "
25231	25271	25177	25177	Cellini	97	" Electricity again , I suppose ! No , I am not angry . Why should I be ? I thank you very much , signor , and I shall thank you more if Heliobas indeed effects my cure . "
25272	25282	25284	25284	Cellini	97	" Oh , that is certain , positively certain , "
25286	25327	25335	25335	he	97	" you can indulge that hope as much as you like , mademoiselle , for it is one that can not be disappointed . Before you leave me , you will look at your own picture , will you not ? "
25404	25411	25413	25413	Cellini	97	" It will soon be finished , "
25420	25458	25413	25413	Cellini	97	" I shall not need another sitting , which is fortunate , as it is so necessary for you to go away . And now will you look at the ' Life and Death ' once more ? "
25476	25486	25489	25489	Cellini	97	" The face of the Life - Angel there , "
25492	25513	25489	25489	Cellini	97	" is a poor and feeble resemblance of the One I love . You knew I was betrothed , mademoiselle ? "
25531	25559	25528	25528	he	97	" Do not trouble to explain , for I know how YOU knew . But no more of this . Will you leave Cannes to - morrow ? "
25560	25567	25528	25528	he	97	" Yes . In the morning . "
25568	25584	25528	25528	he	97	" Then good - bye , mademoiselle . Should I never see you again - - "
25585	25591	25592	25592	I	0	" Never see me again ! "
25595	25603	25592	25592	I	0	" Why , what do you mean ? "
25604	25617	25618	25618	he	97	" I do not allude to your destinies , but to mine , "
25626	25705	25618	25618	he	97	" My business may call me away from here before you come back - our paths may lie apart - many circumstances may occur to prevent our meeting - so that , I repeat , should I never see you again , you will , I hope , bear me in your friendly remembrance as one who was sorry to see you suffer , and who was the humble means of guiding you to renewed health and happiness . "
25760	25776	25777	25777	I	0	" I hope nothing will cause you to leave Cannes till I return to it , "
25783	25796	25777	25777	I	0	" I should like you to judge of my restoration to health . "
25797	25806	25807	25807	he	97	" There will be no need for that , "
25810	25822	25807	25807	he	97	" I shall know when you are quite recovered through Heliobas . "
25829	25839	25840	25840	I	0	" I brought back the book you lent me , "
25844	25862	25840	25840	I	0	" but I should like a copy of it for myself . Can I get it anywhere ? "
25863	25872	25874	25874	Cellini	97	" Heliobas will give you one with pleasure , "
25876	25935	25874	25874	Cellini	97	" you have only to make the request . The book is not on sale . It was printed for private circulation only . And now , mademoiselle , we part . I congratulate you on the comfort and joy awaiting you in Paris . Do not forget the address - Hotel Mars , Champs Elysees . Farewell ! "
26291	26296	26307	26307	she	558	" Ce cher Cellini ! "
26316	26339	26307	26307	she	558	" Je l'aime tant ! Il a si bon coeur ! et ses beaux yeux ! Mon Dieu , comme un ange ! "
26492	26495	26549	26549	I	0	" Salve ! "
26507	26510	26549	26549	I	0	" Hotel Mars "
26519	26522	26549	26549	I	0	" C. H. "
26898	26909	26884	26884	he	571	" My master is ready to receive you , mademoiselle . "
27030	27034	27026	27026	he	579	" Monsieur le Comte "
27573	27581	27582	27582	he	104	" So you are the young musician ? "
27602	27624	27582	27582	he	104	" My friend Raffaello Cellini has written to me about you . I hear you have been suffering from physical depression ? "
27780	27794	27777	27777	he	104	" You know , of course , that I am not a doctor ? "
27795	27799	27800	27800	I	0	" I know , "
27803	27810	27800	27800	I	0	" Signer Cellini explained to me . "
27811	27814	27816	27816	Heliobas	104	" Ah ! "
27819	27898	27816	27816	Heliobas	104	" Raffaello explained as much as he might ; but not everything . I must tell you I have a simple pharmacopoeia of my own - it contains twelve remedies , and only twelve . In fact there me no more that are of any use to the human mechanism . All are made of the juice of plants , and six of them are electric . Raffaello tried you with one of them , did he not ? "
27923	27926	27927	27927	I	0	" Yes , "
27931	27944	27927	27927	I	0	" and it made me dream , and I dreamt of YOU . "
27949	28009	27945	27945	Heliobas	104	" So ! - that is well . Now I am going in the first place to give you what I am sure will be satisfactory information . If you agree to trust yourself to my care , you will be in perfect health in a little less than a fortnight - but you must follow my rules exactly . "
28017	28021	28022	28022	I	0	" Of course ! "
28034	28055	28022	28022	I	0	" I will do all you advise , even if you wish to magnetize me as you magnetized Signor Cellini ! "
28056	28062	28063	28063	he	104	" I never MAGNETIZED Raffaello , "
28067	28142	28063	28063	he	104	" he was on the verge of madness , and he had no faith whereby to save himself . I simply set him free for a time , knowing that his was a genius which would find out things for itself or perish in the effort . I let him go on a voyage of discovery , and he came back perfectly satisfied . That is all . You do not need his experience . "
28143	28149	28150	28150	I	0	" How do you know ? "
28153	28205	28215	28215	his	104	" You are a woman - your desire is to be well and strong , health being beauty - to love and to be beloved - to wear pretty toilettes and to be admired ; and you have a creed which satisfies you , and which you believe in without proofs . "
28283	28295	28296	28296	I	0	" You think I am so slight and weak a thing ! "
28299	28622	28296	28296	I	0	" YOU , who profess to understand the secrets of electricity - you have no better instinctive knowledge of me than that ! Do you deem women all alike - all on one common level , fit for nothing but to be the toys or drudges of men ? Can you not realize that there are some among them who despise the inanities of everyday life - who care nothing for the routine of society , and whose hearts are filled with cravings that no mere human love or life can satisfy ? Yes - even weak women are capable of greatness ; and if we do sometimes dream of what we can not accomplish through lack of the physical force necessary for large achievements , that is not our fault but our misfortune . We did not create ourselves . We did not ask to be born with the over - sensitiveness , the fatal delicacy , the highly - strung nervousness of the feminine nature . Monsieur Heliobas , you are a learned and far - seeing man , I have no doubt ; but you do not read me aright if you judge me as a mere woman who is perfectly contented with the petty commonplaces of ordinary living . And as for my creed , what is it to you whether I kneel in the silence of my own room or in the glory of a lighted cathedral to pour out my very soul to ONE whom I know exists , and whom I am satisfied to believe in , as you say , without proofs , save such proofs as I obtain from my own inner consciousness ? I tell you , though , in your opinion it is evident my sex is against me , I would rather die than sink into the miserable nonentity of such lives as are lived by the majority of women . "
28635	28642	28643	28643	he	104	" So ! You are stung ! "
29196	29196	29190	29190	you	0	"
29197	29201	29202	29202	I	0	" I was , "
29205	29216	29202	29202	I	0	" till my state of health stopped me from working . "
29227	29239	29240	29240	he	104	" You were , and you will be again , an improvisatrice "
29244	29259	29240	29240	he	104	" Do you not find it difficult to make your audiences understand your aims ? "
29277	29280	29281	29281	I	0	" Yes , "
29287	29385	29281	29281	I	0	" In England , at least , people do not know what is meant by IMPROVISING . They think it is to take a little theme and compose variations on it - the mere ABC of the art . But to sit down to the piano and plan a whole sonata or symphony in your head , and play it while planning it , is a thing they do not and will not understand . They come to hear , and they wonder and go away , and the critics declare it to be CLAP - TRAP . "
29386	29389	29391	29391	Heliobas	104	" Exactly ! "
29393	29503	29391	29391	Heliobas	104	" But you are to be congratulated on having attained this verdict . Everything that people can not quite understand is called CLAP - TRAP in England ; as for instance the matchless violin - playing of Sarasate ; the tempestuous splendor of Rubinstein ; the wailing throb of passion in Hollmann 's violoncello - this is , according to the London press , CLAP - TRAP ; while the coldly correct performances of Joachim and the ' icily - null ' renderings of Charles Halle are voted ' magnificent ' and ' full of colour . ' But to return to yourself . Will you play to me ? "
29504	29515	29516	29516	I	0	" I have not touched the instrument for two months , "
29519	29529	29516	29516	I	0	" I am afraid I am out of practice . "
29530	29541	29543	29543	Heliobas	104	" Then you shall not exert yourself to - day , "
29546	29588	29543	29543	Heliobas	104	" But I believe I can help you with your improvisations . You compose the music as you play , you tell me . Well , have you any idea how the melodies or the harmonies form themselves in your brain ? "
29589	29597	29598	29598	I	0	" Not the least in the world , "
29601	29614	29615	29615	he	104	" Is the act of thinking them out an effort to you ? "
29618	29635	29543	29543	Heliobas	104	" Not at all . They come as though someone else were planning them for me . "
29636	29674	29675	29675	He	104	" Well , well ! I think I can certainly be of use to you in this matter as in others . I understand your temperament thoroughly . And now let me give you my first prescription . "
29777	29848	29755	29755	he	104	" To - night , on going to bed , have a warm bath , empty the contents of the tube marked No . 1 into it , and then immerse yourself thoroughly for about five minutes . After the bath , put the fluid in this other tube marked 2 , into a tumbler of fresh spring water , and drink it off . Then go straight to bed . "
29849	29856	29857	29857	I	0	" Shall I have any dreams ? "
29864	29868	29870	29870	Heliobas	104	" Certainly not , "
29874	29934	29870	29870	Heliobas	104	" I wish you to sleep as soundly as a year - old child . Dreams are not for you to - night . Can you come to me tomorrow afternoon at five o'clock ? If you can arrange to stay to dinner , my sister will be pleased to meet you ; but perhaps you are otherwise engaged ? "
29965	29976	29977	29977	he	104	" You shall have no cause to regret this journey , "
29981	30002	29977	29977	he	104	" I can cure you thoroughly , and I will . I forget your nationality - you are not English ? "
30003	30014	29937	29937	him	104	" No , not entirely . I am half Italian . "
30015	30032	29977	29977	he	104	" Ah , yes ! I remember now . But you have been educated in England ? "
30033	30036	29937	29937	him	104	" Partly . "
30037	30046	30048	30048	Heliobas	104	" I am glad it is only partly , "
30050	30112	30048	30048	Heliobas	104	" If it had been entirely , your improvisations would have had no chance . In fact you never would have improvised . You would have played the piano like poor mechanical Arabella Goddard . As it is , there is some hope of originality in you - you need not be one of the rank and file unless you choose . "
30113	30119	30120	30120	I	0	" I do not choose , "
30123	30187	30188	30188	I	0	" Well , but you must take the consequences , and they are bitter . A woman who does not go with her time is voted eccentric ; a woman who prefers music to tea and scandal is an undesirable acquaintance ; and a woman who prefers Byron to Austin Dobson is - in fact , no measure can gauge her general impossibility ! "
30192	30208	30209	30209	I	0	" I will take all the consequences as willingly as I will take your medicines , "
30228	30239	30209	30209	I	0	" And I thank you very much , monsieur . And "
30281	30429	30271	30271	he	104	" I do not accept fees , mademoiselle . To relieve your mind from any responsibility of gratitude to me , I will tell you at once that I never promise to effect a cure unless I see that the person who comes to be cured has a certain connection with myself . If the connection exists I am bound by fixed laws to serve him or her . Of course I am able also to cure those who are NOT by nature connected with me ; but then I have to ESTABLISH a connection , and this takes time , and is sometimes very difficult to accomplish , almost as tremendous a task as the laying down of the Atlantic cable . But in your case I am actually COMPELLED to do my best for you , so you need be under no sense of obligation . "
30448	30455	30456	30456	I	0	" I am connected with you ? "
30461	30468	30456	30456	I	0	" How ? In what way ? "
30469	30482	30484	30484	Heliobas	104	" It would take too long to explain to you just now , "
30487	30517	30484	30484	Heliobas	104	" but I can prove to you in a moment that a connection DOES exist between YOUR inner self , and MY inner self , if you wish it . "
30518	30526	30527	30527	I	0	" I do wish it very much , "
30530	30536	30538	30538	Heliobas	104	" Then take my hand , "
30544	30551	30538	30538	Heliobas	104	" and look steadily at me . "
30737	30743	30744	30744	I	0	" What does it mean ? "
30747	30756	30758	30758	Heliobas	104	" It means the simplest thing in nature , "
30761	30814	30758	30758	Heliobas	104	" namely , that your soul and mine are for some reason or other placed on the same circle of electricity . Nothing more nor less . Therefore we must serve each other . Whatever I do for you , you have it in your power to repay me amply for hereafter . "
30840	30848	30849	30849	I	0	" Decide for me as you please , "
30853	30869	30849	30849	I	0	" I trust you completely , though I do not know why I do so . "
30870	30890	30821	30821	his	104	" You will know before long . You are satisfied of the fact that my touch can influence you ? "
30891	30897	30849	30849	I	0	" Yes ; most thoroughly . "
30898	30990	30821	30821	his	104	" Very well . All other explanations , if you desire them , shall be given you in due time . In the power I possess over you and some others , there is neither mesmerism nor magnetism - nothing but a purely scientific fact which can be clearly and reasonably proved and demonstrated . But till you are thoroughly restored to health , we will defer all discussion . And now , mademoiselle , permit me to escort you to the door . I shall expect you to - morrow . "
31026	31039	31016	31016	Heliobas	104	" Did not the manoeuvres of my street - door astonish you ? "
31040	31044	31045	31045	I	0	" A little , "
31048	31146	31148	31148	he	104	" It is very simple . The button you touch outside is electric ; it opens the door and at the same time rings the bell in my study , thus informing me of a visitor . When the visitor steps across the threshold he treads , whether he will or no , on another apparatus , which closes the door behind him and rings another bell in my page 's room , who immediately comes to me for orders . You see how easy ? And from within it is managed in almost the same manner . "
31185	31200	31167	31167	his	104	" Good - bye , mademoiselle . You are not afraid of me now ? "
31204	31217	31218	31218	I	0	" I do not think I was ever really afraid of you , "
31221	31250	31218	31218	I	0	" If I was , I am not so any longer . You have promised me health , and that promise is sufficient to give me entire courage . "
31251	31256	31258	31258	Heliobas	104	" That is well , "
31260	31306	31258	31258	Heliobas	104	" Courage and hope in themselves are the precursors of physical and mental energy . Remember to - morrow at five , and do not keep late hours to - night . I should advise you to be in bed by ten at the latest . "

32912	32918	32919	32919	I	0	" Dollars are very good , "
32922	32930	32919	32919	I	0	" but real appreciation is far better . "

Poor grand old Beethoven ! Can anything be more pitiful to think of than his deafness ? Yet how splendidly he bore up against it ! And Chopin , too - so delicate in health that he was too often morbid even in his music . Strength is needed to accomplish great things - the double strength of body and soul . "
34042	34051	34052	34052	I	0	" Are you , too , a musician ? "
34055	34098	34151	34151	she	152	" No . I love music passionately , and I play a little on the organ in our private chapel ; but I follow a different art altogether . I am a mere imitator of noble form - I am a sculptress . "

He must have known heroes and talked with gods to be able to hew out of the rocks such perfection of shape and attitude as his ' David . ' Alas ! my strength of brain and hand is mere child 's play compared to what HAS been done in sculpture , and what WILL yet be done ; still , I love the work for its own sake , and I am always trying to render a resemblance of - "
34290	34295	34296	34296	she	152	" Be my friend , "
34308	34450	34296	34296	she	152	" I have no friends of my own sex , and I wish to love you . My brother has always had so much distrust of the companionship of women for me . You know his theories ; and he has always asserted that the sphere of thought in which I have lived all my life is so widely apart from those in which other women exist - that nothing but unhappiness for me could come out of associating us together . When he told me yesterday that you were coming to see me to - day , I knew he must have discovered something in your nature that was not antipathetic to mine ; otherwise he would not have brought you to me . Do you think you can like me ? - perhaps LOVE me after a little while ? "
34595	34612	34613	34613	she	678	" And now we have drawn up , signed , and sealed our compact of friendship , "
34617	34665	34613	34613	she	678	" will you come and see my studio ? There is nothing in it that deserves to last , I think ; still , one has patience with a child when he builds his brick houses , and you must have equal patience with me . Come ! "

35047	35168	35045	35045	Zara	152	" no , indeed ! When the great Italian sculptors lived and worked - ah ! one may say with the Scriptures , ' There were giants in those days . ' Giants - veritable ones ; and we modernists are the pigmies . We can only see Art now through the eyes of others who came before us . We can not create anything new . We look at painting through Raphael ; sculpture through Angelo ; poetry through Shakespeare ; philosophy through Plato . It is all done for us ; we are copyists . The world is getting old - how glorious to have lived when it was young ! But nowadays the very children are blase . "
35169	35192	35193	35193	I	0	" And you - are not you blase to talk like that , with your genius and all the world before you ? "
35203	35208	35193	35193	I	0	" Come , confess ! "
35215	35227	35228	35228	she	152	" I sincerely hope the world is NOT all before me , "
35231	35311	35228	35228	she	152	" I should be very sorry if I thought so . To have the world all before you in the general acceptation of that term means to live long , to barter whatever genius you have for gold , to hear the fulsome and unmeaning flatteries of the ignorant , who are as ready with condemnation as praise - to be envied and maligned by those less lucky than you are . Heaven defend me from such a fate ! "

35512	35521	35522	35522	she	152	" I do not like Prince Ivan myself , "
35525	35554	35522	35522	she	152	" but he is a singularly brave and resolute man , and Casimir has some reason for admitting him to our companionship . Though I greatly doubt if - "
35579	35584	35585	35585	she	152	" Dinner is ready ! "
35588	35632	35585	35585	she	152	" but you must not imagine that we keep a band to play us to our table in triumph . It is simply a musical instrument worked by electricity that imitates the orchestra ; both Casimir and I prefer it to a gong ! "
36197	36206	36207	36207	he	104	" You are a lucky fellow , Ivan , "
36212	36249	36207	36207	he	104	" You like the good things of life , and you have got them all without any trouble on your own part . You are one of those men who have absolutely nothing to wish for . "
36264	36273	36274	36274	he	153	" I am not so sure about that , "
36277	36311	36274	36274	he	153	" No one is contented in this world , I believe . There is always something left to desire , and the last thing longed for always seems the most necessary to happiness . "
36312	36317	36319	36319	Heliobas	104	" The truest philosophy , "
36321	36348	36319	36319	Heliobas	104	" is not to long for anything in particular , but to accept everything as it comes , and find out the reason of its coming . "
36349	36363	36365	36366	Prince Ivan	153	" What do you mean by ' the reason of its coming ' ? "
36368	36384	36365	36366	Prince Ivan	153	" Do you know , Casimir , I find you sometimes as puzzling as Socrates . "
36385	36404	36406	36406	Heliobas	104	" Socrates ? - Socrates was as clear as a drop of morning dew , my dear fellow , "
36408	36606	36406	36406	Heliobas	104	" There was nothing puzzling about him . His remarks were all true and trenchant - hitting smartly home to the heart like daggers plunged down to the hilt . That was the worst of him - he was too clear - too honest - too disdainful of opinions . Society does not love such men . What do I mean , you ask , by accepting everything as it comes , and trying to find out the reason of its coming ? Why , I mean what I say . Each circumstance that happens to each one of us brings its own special lesson and meaning - forms a link or part of a link in the chain of our existence . It seems nothing to you that you walk down a particular street at a particular hour , and yet that slight action of yours may lead to a result you wot not of . ' Accept the hint of each new experience , ' says the American imitator of Plato - Emerson . If this advice is faithfully followed , we all have enough to occupy us busily from the cradle to the grave . "
36635	36640	36641	36641	he	153	" I tell you , "
36648	36685	36641	36641	he	153	" there are some hints that we can not accept - some circumstances that we must not yield to . Why should a man , for instance , be subjected to an undeserved and bitter disappointment ? "
36686	36689	36691	36691	Zara	152	" Because , "
36702	36716	36691	36691	Zara	152	" he has most likely desired what he is not fated to obtain . "
36729	36744	36745	36745	he	153	" I know , madame , you are against me in all our arguments , "
36755	36828	36745	36745	he	153	" As Casimir suggests , I am a bad philosopher . I do not pretend to more than the ordinary attributes of an ordinary man ; it is fortunate , if I may be permitted to say so , that the rest of the word 's inhabitants are very like me , for if everyone reached to the sublime heights of science and knowledge that you and your brother have attained - - "
36829	36847	36849	36849	Heliobas	104	" The course of human destiny would run out , and Paradise would be an established fact , "
36851	36876	36849	36849	Heliobas	104	" Come , Ivan ! You are a true Epicurean . Have some more wine , and a truce to discussions for the present . "
37007	37015	37017	37017	Heliobas	104	" You know Leo , of course , "
37023	37051	37017	37017	Heliobas	104	" He went to see Raffaello while you were at Cannes . He is a wonderful animal - more valuable to me than his weight in gold . "
37089	37096	37097	37097	he	721	" It was really through Leo , "
37100	37120	37097	37097	he	721	" that you were induced to follow out your experiments in human electricity , Casimir , was it not ? "
37121	37124	37126	37126	Heliobas	104	" Yes , "
37141	37217	37218	37218	he	104	" I should never have been much encouraged in my researches , had he not been at hand . I feared to experimentalize much on my sister , she being young at the time - and women are always frail of construction - but Leo was willing and ready to be a victim to science , if necessary . Instead of a martyr he is a living triumph - are you not , old boy ? "
37253	37288	37249	37249	I	0	" Will you tell me in what way Leo has been useful to you ? I have a great affection for dogs , and I never tire of hearing stories of their wonderful intelligence . "
37289	37296	37298	37298	Heliobas	104	" I will certainly tell you , "
37300	37812	37298	37298	Heliobas	104	" To some people the story might appear improbable , but it is perfectly true and at the same time simple of comprehension . When I was a very young man , younger than Prince Ivan , I absorbed myself in the study of electricity - its wonderful powers , and its various capabilities . From the consideration of electricity in the different forms by which it is known to civilized Europe , I began to look back through history , to what are ignorantly called ' the dark ages , ' but which might more justly be termed the enlightened youth of the world . I found that the force of electricity was well understood by the ancients - better understood by them , in fact , than it is by the scientists of our day . The ' MENE , MENE , TEKEL , UPHARSIN ' that glittered in unearthly characters on the wall at Belshazzar 's feast , was written by electricity ; and the Chaldean kings and priests understood a great many secrets of another form of electric force which the world to - day scoffs at and almost ignores - I mean human electricity , which we all possess , but which we do not all cultivate within us . When once I realized the existence of the fact of human electric force , I applied the discovery to myself , and spared no pains to foster and educate whatever germ of this power lay within me . I succeeded with more ease and celerity than I had imagined possible . At the time I pursued these studies , Leo here was quite a young dog , full of the clumsy playfulness and untrained ignorance of a Newfoundland puppy . One day I was very busy reading an interesting Sanskrit scroll which treated of ancient medicines and remedies , and Leo was gambolling in his awkward way about the room , playing with an old slipper and worrying it with his teeth . The noise he made irritated and disturbed me , and I rose in my chair and called him by name , somewhat angrily . He paused in his game and looked up - his eyes met mine exactly . His head drooped ; he shivered uneasily , whined , and lay down motionless . He never stirred once from the position he had taken , till I gave him permission - and remember , he was untrained . This strange behaviour led me to try other experiments with him , and all succeeded . I gradually led him up to the point I desired - that is , I FORCED HIM TO RECEIVE MY THOUGHT AND ACT UPON IT , as far as his canine capabilities could do , and he has never once failed . It is sufficient for me to strongly WILL him to do a certain thing , and I can convey that command of mine to his brain without uttering a single word , and he will obey me . "
37832	37891	37825	37825	Heliobas	104	" I will put him to the proof at any time you like . If you wish him to fetch anything that he is physically able to carry , and will write the name of whatever it is on a slip of paper , just for me to know what you require , I guarantee Leo 's obedience . "
37901	37913	37914	37914	she	152	" It seems like magic to you , does it not ? "
37917	37927	37914	37914	she	152	" but I assure you it is quite true . "
37928	37935	37937	37938	Prince Ivan	153	" I am bound to admit , "
37940	37961	37962	37962	he	153	" that I once doubted both Leo and his master , but I am quite converted . Here , mademoiselle , "
37978	38014	37962	37962	he	153	" write down something that you want ; only do n't send the dog to Italy on an errand just now , as we want him back before we adjourn to the drawing - room . "
38267	38275	38276	38276	I	0	" Can you command human beings so ? "
38286	38290	38292	38292	Heliobas	104	" Not all , "
38295	38406	38292	38292	Heliobas	104	" In fact , I may say , very few . Those who are on my own circle of power I can , naturally , draw to or repel from me ; but those who are not , have to be treated by different means . Sometimes cases occur in which persons , at first NOT on my circle , are irresistibly attracted to it by a force not mine . Sometimes , in order to perform a cure , I establish a communication between myself and a totally alien sphere of thought ; and to do this is a long and laborious effort . But it can be done . "
38407	38416	38418	38419	Prince Ivan	153	" Then , if it can be done , "
38421	38431	38418	38419	Prince Ivan	153	" why do you not accomplish it for me ? "
38432	38448	38450	38450	Heliobas	104	" Because you are being forcibly drawn towards me without any effort on my part , "
38461	38508	38455	38455	his	104	" For what motive I can not at present determine ; but I shall know as soon as you touch the extreme edge of my circle . You are a long way off it yet , but you are coming in spite of yourself , Ivan . "
38530	38548	38549	38549	he	104	" If I did not know you to be an absolutely truthful and honourable man , Casimir , "
38552	38591	38549	38549	he	104	" I should think you were trying to deceive me . But I have seen what you can do , therefore I must believe you . Still I confess I do not follow you in your circle theory . "
38592	38597	38599	38599	Heliobas	104	" To begin with , "
38601	39056	38599	38599	Heliobas	104	" the Universe is a circle . Everything is circular , from the motion of planets down to the human eye , or the cup of a flower , or a drop of dew . MY ' circle theory , ' as you call it , applied to human electric force , is very simple ; but I have proved it to be mathematically correct . Every human being is provided INTERNALLY and EXTERNALLY with a certain amount of electricity , which is as necessary to existence as the life - blood to the heart or fresh air to the lungs . Internally it is the germ of a soul or spirit , and is placed there to be either cultivated or neglected as suits the WILL of man . It is indestructible ; yet , if neglected , it remains always a germ ; and , at the death of the body it inhabits , goes elsewhere to seek another chance of development . If , on the contrary , its growth is fostered by a persevering , resolute WILL , it becomes a spiritual creature , glorious and supremely powerful , for which a new , brilliant , and endless existence commences when its clay chrysalis perishes . So much for the INTERNAL electrical force . The EXTERNAL binds us all by fixed laws , with which our wills have nothing whatever to do . Each one of us walks the earth encompassed by an invisible electric ring - wide or narrow according to our capabilities . Sometimes our rings meet and form one , as in the case of two absolutely sympathetic souls , who labour and love together with perfect faith in each other . Sometimes they clash , and storm ensues , as when a strong antipathy between persons causes them almost to loathe each other 's presence . All these human electric rings are capable of attraction and repulsion . If a man , during his courtship of a woman , experiences once or twice a sudden instinctive feeling that there is something in her nature not altogether what he expected or desired , let him take warning and break off the attachment ; for the electric circles do not combine , and nothing but unhappiness would come from forcing a union . I would say the same thing to a woman . If my advice were followed , how many unhappy marriages would be avoided ! But you have tempted me to talk too much , Ivan . I see the ladies wish to adjourn . Shall we go to the smoking - room for a little , and join them in the drawing - room afterwards ? "
39061	39064	39066	39067	the Prince	708	" Well , "
39078	39128	39071	39071	he	708	" I realize one thing which gives me pleasure , Casimir . If in truth I am being attracted towards your electric circle , I hope I shall reach it soon , as I shall then , I suppose , be more en rapport with madame , your sister . "
39144	39156	39157	39157	she	152	" By the time YOU arrive at that goal , Prince , "
39161	39172	39157	39157	she	152	" it is most probable that I shall have departed . "
39196	39213	39214	39214	she	152	" Would you like to see the chapel on your way to the drawing - room ? "
39471	39481	39484	39484	Zara	152	" You are a Catholic , are you not ? "
39488	39491	39492	39492	I	0	" Yes , "
39495	39498	39492	39492	I	0	" but - "
39499	39587	39603	39603	herself	152	" But you have doubts sometimes , you would say ! Of course . One always doubts when one sees the dissensions , the hypocrisies , the false pretences and wickedness of many professing Christians . But Christ and His religion are living facts , in spite of the suicide of souls He would gladly save . You must ask Casimir some day about these things ; he will clear up all the knotty points for you . Here we are at the drawing - room door . "
39615	39619	39620	39620	she	152	" Tell me , "
39623	39641	39620	39620	she	152	" can you not come here and stay with me while you are under Casimir 's treatment ? "
39651	39657	39658	39658	I	0	" I wish I could , "
39661	39694	39658	39658	I	0	" but I fear my friends would want to know where I am staying , and explanations would have to be given , which I do not feel disposed to enter upon . "
39695	39698	39701	39701	Zara	152	" Why , "
39704	39745	39701	39701	Zara	152	" you have only to say that you are being attended by a Dr. Casimir who wishes to have you under his own supervision , and that you are therefore staying in his house under the chaperonage of his sister . "
39772	39781	39782	39782	she	152	" Do you know how old I am ? "
39803	39810	39812	39812	Zara	152	" I am thirty - eight , "
39864	39873	39874	39874	she	152	" You may doubt me if you choose , "
39880	40023	39874	39874	she	152	" but I have told you the truth . I am thirty - eight years of age according to the world 's counting . What I am , measured by another standard of time , matters not just now . You see I look young , and , what is more , I am young . I enjoy my youth . I hear that women of society at thirty - eight are often faded and blase - what a pity it is that they do not understand the first laws of self - preservation ! But to resume what I was saying , you know now that I am quite old enough in the eyes of the world to chaperon you or anybody . You had better arrange to stay here . Casimir asked me to settle the matter with , you . "
40057	40148	40049	40049	He	104	" I have ordered my carriage , mademoiselle , to take you back this evening to the Avenue du Midi . If you will do as Zara tells you , and explain to your friends the necessity there is for your being under the personal supervision of your doctor , you will find everything will arrange itself very naturally . And the sooner you come here the better - in fact , Zara will expect you here to - morrow early in the afternoon . I may rely upon you ? "
40226	40252	40253	40253	I	0	" I will do as you wish , monsieur . Having placed myself in your hands , I must obey . In this particular case , "
40260	40268	40253	40253	I	0	" obedience is very agreeable to me . "
40313	40338	40305	40305	he	104	" Drink this - it is your dose for to - night ; and then you will go home , and straight to bed . "
40357	40366	40368	40369	Prince Ivan	153	" Have you no soothing draught for me ? "
40388	40391	40393	40393	Heliobas	104	" No , "
40402	40416	40393	40393	Heliobas	104	" the draught fitted for your present condition might soothe you too thoroughly . "
40462	40469	40470	40470	he	104	" Sing to us , Ivan , "
40478	40506	40470	40470	he	104	" Sing us one of your wild Russian airs - Zara loves them , and this young lady would like to hear your voice before she goes . "
40595	40632	40567	40567	He	713	" As the billows fling shells on the shore , As the sun poureth light on the sea , As a lark on the wing scatters song to the spring , So rushes my love to thee .
40633	40671	40567	40567	He	713	" As the ivy clings close to the tower , As the dew lieth deep in a flower , As the shadow to light , as the day unto night , So clings my wild soul to thee !
40672	40704	40567	40567	He	713	" As the moon glitters coldly alone , Above earth on her cloud - woven throne , As the rocky - bound cave repulses a wave , So thy anger repulseth me .
40705	40739	40567	40567	He	713	" As the bitter black frost of a night Slays the roses with pitiless might , As a sharp dagger - thrust hurls a king to the dust , So thy cruelty murdereth me .
40740	40784	40567	40567	He	713	" Yet in spite of thy queenly disdain , Thou art seared by my passion and pain ; Thou shalt hear me repeat , till I die for it , sweet ! ' I love thee ! I dare to love THEE ! ' "
40842	40850	40836	40837	The page	694	" the carriage was waiting for mademoiselle , "
40865	40872	40857	40857	Zara	152	" Come early to - morrow , "
40976	40991	40992	40992	he	104	" We will try to make all your time with us pass as pleasantly , "
40995	41004	41006	41006	he	104	" Good - night ! What , Ivan , "
41020	41026	41008	41009	the Prince	708	" are you also going ? "
41027	41034	41035	41035	he	104	" Yes , I am off , "
41045	41083	41035	41035	he	104	" I am bad company for anyone to - night , and I wo n't inflict myself upon you , Casimir . Au revoir ! I will put mademoiselle into the carriage if she will permit me . "
41111	41118	41108	41108	he	708	" Are you one of them ! "
41126	41131	41132	41132	I	0	" One of them ! "
41135	41141	41132	41132	I	0	" What do you mean ? "
41142	41146	41147	41147	he	708	" Never mind , "
41167	41206	41152	41152	he	708	" if you are not now , you will be , or Zara would not have kissed you . If you ever have the chance ask her to think of me at my best . Good - night . "
41236	41243	41225	41225	He	708	" 36 , Avenue du Midi , "
41378	41383	41384	41384	she	139	" Oh , mademoiselle , "
41387	41436	41384	41384	she	139	" have you not dread of that terrible man ? Is it not he that is reported to be a cruel mesmerist who sacrifices everybody - yes , even his own sister , to his medical experiments ? Ah , mon Dieu ! it makes me to shudder ! "
41485	41495	41496	41496	I	0	" Do you know Dr. Casimir and his sister ? "
41500	41529	41532	41532	she	139	" I have seen them , mademoiselle ; perhaps once - twice - three times ! It is true madame is lovely as an angel ; but they say "
41538	41604	41532	41532	she	139	" that she is wedded to a devil ! It is true , mademoiselle - all people say so . And Suzanne Michot - a very respectable young person , mademoiselle , from Auteuil - she was employed at one time as under - housemaid at Dr. Casimir 's , and she had things to say - ah , to make the blood like ice ! "
41605	41611	41612	41612	I	0	" What did she say ? "
41619	41622	41624	41625	Madame Denise	139	" Well , "
41634	41735	41624	41625	Madame Denise	139	" Suzanne - I assure you a most respectable girl - said that one evening she was crossing the passage near Madame Casimir 's boudoir , and she saw a light like fire coming through the curtains of the portiere . And she stopped to listen , and she heard a strange music like the sound of harps . She ventured to go nearer - Suzanne is a brave girl , mademoiselle , and most virtuous - and to raise the curtain the smallest portion just to permit the glance of an eye . And - imagine what she saw . "
41736	41739	41740	41740	I	0	" Well ! "
41744	41750	41740	41740	I	0	" WHAT did she see ? "
41751	41986	41624	41625	Madame Denise	139	" Ah , mademoiselle , you will not believe me - but Suzanne Michot has respectable parents , and would not tell a lie - well , Suzanne saw her mistress , Madame Casimir , standing up near her couch with both arms extended as to embrace the air . Round her there was - believe it or not , mademoiselle , as you please - a ring of light like a red fire , which seemed to grow larger and redder always . All suddenly , madame grew pale and more pale , and then fell on her couch as one dead , and all the red fire went out . Suzanne had fear , and she tried to call out - but now see what happened to Suzanne ! She was PUSHED from the spot , mademoiselle , pushed along as though by some strong personage ; yet she saw no one till she reached her own door , and in her room she fainted from alarm . The very next morning Dr. Casimir dismissed her , with her full wages and a handsome present besides ; but he LOOKED at her , Suzanne said , in a manner to make her tremble from head to foot . Now , mademoiselle , judge yourself whether it is fit for one who is suffering with nerves to go to so strange a house ! "
42029	42072	42026	42026	I	0	" Your words only make me more desirous to go , Madame Denise . Besides , Dr. Casimir has already done me a great deal of good . You must have heard things of him that are not altogether bad , surely ? "
42088	42200	42073	42075	The little woman	778	" It is certainly true , mademoiselle , that in the quarter of the poor he is much beloved . Jean Duclos - he is a chiffonnier - had his one child dying of typhoid fever , and he was watching it struggling for breath ; it was at the point to die . Monsieur le Comte Casimir , or Dr. Casimir - for he is called both - came in all suddenly , and in half an hour had saved the little one 's life . I do not deny that he may have some good in him , and that he understands medicine ; but there is something wrong - "
43243	43265	43238	43238	she	152	" I think I will go to work again to - morrow morning , if you will not think me unsociable . "
43266	43272	43273	43273	I	0	" Why , Zara dearest ! "
43276	43299	43273	43273	I	0	" Of course I shall not think you unsociable . I would not interfere with any of your pursuits for the world . "
43314	43363	43300	43300	She	152	" But you must know I like to work quite alone , and though it may look churlish , still not even you must come into the studio . I never can do anything before a witness ; Casimir himself knows that , and keeps away from me . "
43364	43367	43368	43368	I	0	" Well ! "
43371	43470	43368	43368	I	0	" I should be an ungrateful wretch if I could not oblige you in so small a request . I promise not to disturb you , Zara ; and do not think for one moment that I shall be dull . I have books , a piano , flowers - what more do I want ? And if I like I can go out ; then I have letters to write , and all sorts of things to occupy me . I shall be quite happy , and I shall not come near you till you call me . "
43475	43482	43483	43483	she	152	" You are a dear girl , "
43486	43551	43483	43483	she	152	" I hate to appear inhospitable , but I know you are a real friend - that you will love me as much away from you as near you , and that you have none of that vulgar curiosity which some women give way to , when what they desire to see is hidden from them . You are not inquisitive , are you ? "
43555	43578	43579	43579	I	0	" The affairs of other people have never appeared so interesting to me that I have cared to bother myself about them , "
43582	43602	43579	43579	I	0	" Blue - Beard 's Chamber would never have been unlocked had I been that worthy man 's wife . "
43603	43616	43618	43618	Zara	152	" What a fine moral lesson the old fairy - tale teaches ! "
43620	43703	43618	43618	Zara	152	" I always think those wives of Blue - Beard deserved their fate for not being able to obey him in his one request . But in regard to your pursuits , dear , while I am at work in my studio , you can use the grand piano in the drawing - room when you please , as well as the little one in your own room ; and you can improvise on the chapel organ as much as you like . "
43720	43734	43735	43735	she	152	" What happiness it must be for you to love music so thoroughly ! "
43738	44071	43735	43735	she	152	" It fills you with enthusiasm . I used to dislike to read the biographies of musical people ; they all seemed to find so much fault with one another , and grudged each other every little bit of praise wrung from the world 's cold , death - doomed lips . It is to me pathetically absurd to see gifted persons all struggling along , and rudely elbowing each other out of the way to win - what ? A few stilted commonplace words of approbation or fault - finding in the newspapers of the day , and a little clapping and shouting from a gathering of ordinary minded persons , who only clap and shout because it is possibly the fashion to do so . It is really ludicrous . If the music the musician offers to the public be really great , it will live by itself and defy praise or blame . Because Schubert died of want and sorrow , that does not interfere with the life of his creations . Because Wagner is voted impossible and absurd by many who think themselves good judges of musical art , that does not offer any obstacle to the steady spread of his fame , which is destined to become as universal as that of Shakespeare . Poor Joachim , the violinist , has got a picture in his private house , in which Wagner is painted as suffering the tortures of hell ; can anything be more absurd , when we consider how soon the learned fiddler , who has occupied his life in playing other people 's compositions , will be a handful of forgotten dust , while multitudes yet to come will shout their admiration of ' Tristran ' and ' Parsifal . ' Yes , as I said , I never cared for musical people much , till I met a friend of my brother 's - a man whose inner life was an exquisite harmony . "
44072	44076	44077	44077	I	0	" I know ! "
44081	44093	44077	44077	I	0	" He wrote the ' Letters of a Dead Musician . ' "
44094	44097	44099	44099	Zara	152	" Yes , "
44101	44245	44099	44099	Zara	152	" I suppose you saw the book at Raffaello 's studio . Good Raffaello Cellini ! his is another absolutely ungrudging and unselfish spirit . But this musician that I speak of was like a child in humility and reverence . Casimir told me he had never sounded so perfect a nature . At one time he , too , was a little anxious for recognition and praise , and Casimir saw that he was likely to wreck himself on that fatal rock of poor ambition . So he took him in hand , and taught him the meaning of his work , and why it was especially given him to do ; and that man 's life became ' one grand sweet song . ' But there are tears in your eyes , dear ! What have I said to grieve you ? "
44284	44293	44294	44294	I	0	" They are not sad tears , Zara , "
44297	44405	44294	44294	I	0	" I think they come from a strong desire I have to be what you are , what your brother is , what that dead musician must have been . Why , I have longed , and do long for fame , for wealth , for the world 's applause , for all the things which you seem to think so petty and mean . How can I help it ? Is not fame power ? Is not money a double power , strong to assist one 's self and those one loves ? Is not the world 's favour a necessary means to gain these things ? "
44417	44427	44428	44428	she	152	" Do you understand what you mean by power ? "
44431	44564	44428	44428	she	152	" World 's fame ? World 's wealth ? Will these things make you enjoy life ? You will perhaps say yes . I tell you no . Laurels of earth 's growing fade ; gold of earth 's getting is good for a time , but it palls quickly . Suppose a man rich enough to purchase all the treasures of the world - what then ? He must die and leave them . Suppose a poet or musician so famous that all nations know and love him : he too must die , and go where nations exist no longer . And you actually would grasp ashes and drink wormwood , little friend ? Music , the heaven - born spirit of pure sound , does not teach you so ! "
44607	44610	44611	44611	I	0	" Still , "
44614	44641	44611	44611	I	0	" you yourself admit that such fame as that of Shakespeare or Wagner becomes a universal monument to their memories . That is something , surely ? "
44642	44647	44649	44649	Zara	152	" Not to them , "
44651	44686	44649	44649	Zara	152	" they have partly forgotten that they ever were imprisoned in such a narrow gaol as this world . Perhaps they do not care to remember it , though memory is part of immortality . "
44687	44690	44691	44691	I	0	" Ah ! "
44695	44711	44691	44691	I	0	" your thoughts go beyond me , Zara . I can not follow your theories . "
44715	44725	44726	44726	she	152	" We will not talk about them any more , "
44729	44745	44726	44726	she	152	" you must tell Casimir - he will teach you far better than I can . "
44746	44753	44754	44754	I	0	" What shall I tell him ? "
44757	44765	44754	44754	I	0	" and what will he teach me ? "
44766	44784	44786	44786	Zara	152	" You will tell him what a high opinion you have of the world and its judgments , "
44788	44864	44786	44786	Zara	152	" and he will teach you that the world is no more than a grain of dust , measured by the standard of your own soul . This is no mere platitude - no repetition of the poetical statement ' THE MIND 'S THE STANDARD OF THE MAN ; ' it is a fact , and can be proved as completely as that two and two make four . Ask Casimir to set you free . "
44865	44871	44872	44872	I	0	" To set me free ? "
44877	44880	44882	44882	Zara	152	" Yes ! "
44888	44900	44882	44882	Zara	152	" He will know if you are strong enough to travel ! "
45110	45113	45064	45064	my	0	" vox humana "
45263	45287	45289	45289	I	0	" Is it all true ? Was Christ indeed Divine - or is it all a myth , a fable - an imposture ? "
45451	45465	45477	45477	He	104	" So ! you are agitated and alarmed ! Unbelief is easily scared ! "
45533	45907	45521	45521	he	104	" You have been led astray , my child , by the conflicting and vain opinions of mankind . You , like many others in the world , delight to question , to speculate , to weigh this , to measure that , with little or no profit to yourself or your fellow - creatures . And you have come freshly from a land where , in the great Senate - house , a poor perishable lump of clay calling itself a man , dares to stand up boldly and deny the existence of God , while his compeers , less bold than he , pretend a holy displeasure , yet secretly support him - all blind worms denying the existence of the sun ; a land where so - called Religion is split into hundreds of cold and narrow sects , gatherings assembled for the practice of hypocrisy , lip - service and lies - where Self , not the Creator , is the prime object of worship ; a land , mighty once among the mightiest , but which now , like an over - ripe pear , hangs loosely on its tree , awaiting but a touch to make it fall ! A land - let me not name it ; - where the wealthy , high - fed ministers of the nation slowly argue away the lives of better men than themselves , with vain words of colder and more cruel force than the whirling spears of untaught savages ! What have you , an ardent disciple of music , to do in such a land where favouritism and backstair influence win the day over even the merits of a Schubert ? Supposing you were a second Beethoven , what could you do in that land without faith or hope ? that land which is like a disappointed , churlish , and aged man with tottering feet and purblind eyes , who has long ago exhausted all enjoyment and sees nothing new under the sun . The world is wide - faith is yet extant - and the teachings of Christ are true . ' Believe and live ; doubt and die ! ' That saying is true also . "
45932	45935	45936	45936	I	0	" Then , "
45939	45991	45936	45936	I	0	" if I have been misguided by modern opinions - if I have unconsciously absorbed the doctrines of modern fashionable atheism - lead me right . Teach me what you know . I am willing to learn . Let me find out the reason of my life . SET ME FREE ! "
45999	46004	46005	46005	he	104	" Set you free ! "
46013	46021	46005	46005	he	104	" Do you know what you ask ? "
46022	46025	46026	46026	I	0	" No , "
46033	46135	46026	46026	I	0	" I do not know what I ask ; but I feel that you have the power to show me the unseen things of another world . Did you not yourself tell me in our first interview that you had let Raffaello Cellini ' go on a voyage of discovery , and that he came back perfectly satisfied ? ' Besides , he told me his history . From you he has gained all that gives him peace and comfort . You possess electric secrets undreamt of by the world . Prove your powers upon me ; I am not afraid . "
46139	46198	46136	46136	Heliobas	104	" Not afraid ! And you ran out of the chapel just now as if you were pursued by a fiend ! You must know that the only WOMAN I ever tried my greatest experiment upon is my sister Zara . She was trained and prepared for it in the most careful manner ; and it succeeded . Now "
46281	46281	46275	46275	I	0	"
46298	46314	46290	46290	I	0	" You mean that I shall be dominated also by some great force or influence ? "
46315	46320	46322	46322	Heliobas	104	" I think so , "
46325	46360	46322	46322	Heliobas	104	" Your nature is more prone to love than to command . Try and follow me in the explanation I am going to give you . Do you know some lines by Shelley that run -
46361	46390	46290	46290	I	0	" ' Nothing in the world is single , All things by a law divine In one another 's being mingle - Why not I with thine ? ' "
46391	46394	46395	46395	I	0	" Yes , "
46398	46415	46395	46395	I	0	" I know the lines well . I used to think them very sentimental and pretty . "
46416	46420	46422	46422	Heliobas	104	" They contain , "
46424	46713	46422	46422	Heliobas	104	" the germ of a great truth , as many of the most fanciful verses of the poets do . As the ' image of a voice ' mentioned in the Book of Job hinted at the telephone , and as Shakespeare 's ' girdle round the earth ' foretold the electric telegraph , so the utterances of the inspired starvelings of the world , known as poets , suggest many more wonders of the universe than may be at first apparent . Poets must always be prophets , or their calling is in vain . Put this standard of judgment to the verse - writers of the day , and where would they be ? The English Laureate is no seer : he is a mere relater of pretty stories . Algernon Charles Swinburne has more fire in him , and more wealth of expression , but he does not prophesy ; he has a clever way of combining Biblical similes with Provengal passion - et voila tout ! The prophets are always poor - the sackcloth and ashes of the world are their portion ; and their bodies moulder a hundred years or more in the grave before the world finds out what they meant by their ravings . But apropos of these lines of Shelley . He speaks of the duality of existence . ' Nothing in the world is single . ' He might have gone further , and said nothing in the universe is single . Cold and heat , storm and sunshine , good and evil , joy and sorrow - all go in pairs . This double life extends to all the spheres and above the spheres . Do you understand ? "
46714	46721	46722	46722	I	0	" I understand what you say , "
46726	46741	46722	46722	I	0	" but I can not see your meaning as applied to myself or yourself . "
46742	46752	46755	46755	Heliobas	104	" I will teach you in a few words , "
46757	46764	46755	46755	Heliobas	104	" You believe in the soul ? "
46765	46768	46422	46422	Heliobas	104	" Yes . "
46769	46939	46755	46755	Heliobas	104	" Very well . Now realize that there is no soul on this earth that is complete , ALONE . Like everything else , it is dual . It is like half a flame that seeks the other half , and is dissatisfied and restless till it attains its object . Lovers , misled by the blinding light of Love , think they have reached completeness when they are united to the person beloved . Now , in very , very rare cases , perhaps one among a thousand , this desirable result is effected ; but the majority of people are content with the union of bodies only , and care little or nothing about the sympathy or attachment between souls . There are people , however , who do care , and who never find their Twin - Flame or companion Spirit at all on earth , and never will find it . And why ? Because it is not imprisoned in clay ; it is elsewhere . "
46940	46943	46944	46944	I	0	" Well ? "
46948	47163	46755	46755	Heliobas	104	" Well , you seem to ask me by your eyes what this all means . I will apply it at once to myself . By my researches into human electrical science , I discovered that MY companion , MY other half of existence , though not on earth , was near me , and could be commanded by me ; and , on being commanded , obeyed . With Zara it was different . She could not COMMAND - she OBEYED ; she was the weaker of the two . With you , I think it will be the same thing . Men sacrifice everything to ambition ; women to love . It is natural . I see there is much of what I have said that appears to have mystified you ; it is no good puzzling your brain any more about it . No doubt you think I am talking very wildly about Twin - Flames and Spiritual Affinities that live for us in another sphere . You do not believe , perhaps , in the existence of beings in the very air that surrounds us , invisible to ordinary human eyes , yet actually akin to us , with a closer relationship than any tie of blood known on earth ? "

47203	47326	47197	47197	he	104	" Where do you suppose your music comes from ? Where do you suppose any music comes from that is not mere imitation ? The greatest composers of the world have been mere receptacles of sound ; and the emptier they were of self - love and vanity , the greater quantity of heaven - born melody they held . The German Wagner - did he not himself say that he walked up and down in the avenues , ' trying to catch the harmonies as they floated in the air ' ? Come with me - come back to the place you left , and I will see if you , like Wagner , are able to catch a melody flying . "
47360	47368	47369	47369	he	104	" Do not play a single note , "
47372	47378	47369	47369	he	104	" till you are compelled . "
47441	47444	47445	47445	he	104	" Azul ! "
47455	47471	47445	47445	he	104	" open the gateways of the Air that we may hear the sound of Song ! "
47731	47737	47738	47738	I	0	" Have I lost it ? "
47741	47745	47746	47746	he	104	" Lost what ? "
47749	47758	47706	47706	his	104	" The tune I heard - the harmonies . "
47759	47762	47763	47763	he	104	" No , "
47766	47793	47763	47763	he	104	" at least I think not . But if you have , no matter . You will hear others . Why do you look so distressed ? "
47794	47799	47800	47800	I	0	" It is lovely , "
47804	47815	47800	47800	I	0	" all that music ; but it is not MINE ; "
47824	47838	47800	47800	I	0	" Oh , if it were only mine - my very own composition ! "
47843	48086	47839	47839	Heliobas	104	" It is as much yours as any thing belongs to anyone . Yours ? why , what can you really call your own ? Every talent you have , every breath you draw , every drop of blood flowing in your veins , is lent to you only ; you must pay it all back . And as far as the arts go , it is a bad sign of poet , painter , or musician , who is arrogant enough to call his work his own . It never was his , and never will be . It is planned by a higher intelligence than his , only he happens to be the hired labourer chosen to carry out the conception ; a sort of mechanic in whom boastfulness looks absurd ; as absurd as if one of the stonemasons working at the cornice of a cathedral were to vaunt himself as the designer of the whole edifice . And when a work , any work , is completed , it passes out of the labourer 's hands ; it belongs to the age and the people for whom it was accomplished , and , if deserving , goes on belonging to future ages and future peoples . So far , and only so far , music is your own . But are you convinced ? or do you think you have been dreaming all that you heard just now ? "
48131	48137	48138	48138	I	0	" I believe in YOU , "
48142	48222	48138	48138	I	0	" and I know thoroughly well that I was not dreaming ; I certainly heard strange music , and entrancing voices . But in acknowledging your powers over something unseen , I must explain to you the incredulity I at first felt , which I believe annoyed you . I was made sceptical on one occasion , by attending a so - called spiritual seance , where they tried to convince me of the truth of table - turning - "
48232	48333	48223	48223	Heliobas	104	" Your reason will at once tell you that disembodied spirits never become so undignified as to upset furniture or rap on tables . Neither do they write letters in pen and ink and put them under doors . Spiritual beings are purely spiritual ; they can not touch anything human , much less deal in such vulgar display as the throwing about of chairs , and the opening of locked sideboards . You were very rightly sceptical in these matters . But in what I have endeavoured to prove to you , you have no doubts , have you ? "
48334	48340	48341	48341	I	0	" None in the world , "
48344	48373	48341	48341	I	0	" I only ask you to go on teaching me the wonders that seem so familiar to you . Let me know all I may ; and soon ! "
48380	48394	48396	48396	Heliobas	104	" You have been only eight days in the house , my child , "
48414	48453	48396	48396	Heliobas	104	" and I do not consider you sufficiently strong as yet for the experiment you wish me to try upon you . Even now you are agitated . Wait one week more , and then you shall be - "
48454	48457	48458	48458	I	0	" What ? "
48462	48466	48467	48467	he	104	" Lifted up , "
48470	48629	48637	48637	he	832	" Lifted up above this little speck called earth . But now , no more of this . Go to Zara ; keep your mind well employed ; study , read , and pray - pray much and often in few and simple words , and with as utterly unselfish a heart as you can prepare . Think that you are going to some high festival , and attire your soul in readiness . I do not say to you ' Have faith ; ' I would not compel your belief in anything against your own will . You wish to be convinced of a future existence ; you seek proofs ; you shall have them . In the meantime avoid all conversation with me on the subject . You can confide your desires to Zara if you like ; her experience may be of use to you . You had best join her now . Au revoir ! "
48714	48718	48729	48730	Raffaello Cellini	97	" lifted up , "
48783	48791	48792	48792	she	152	" You have had a long practice , "
48795	48803	48792	48792	she	152	" I thought you were never coming . "
48832	48838	48839	48839	she	152	" You are quite resolved , "
48847	48857	48839	48839	she	152	" to let Casimir exert his force upon you ? "
48858	48864	48865	48865	I	0	" I am quite resolved , "
48868	48875	48839	48839	she	152	" And you have no fear ? "
48876	48886	48839	48839	she	152	" None that I am just now conscious of . "
48907	48950	48904	48904	she	152	" I can help you to keep your courage firmly to the point , by letting you know at once what Casimir will do to you . Beyond that I can not go . You understand the nature of an electric shock ? "
48951	48954	48955	48955	I	0	" Yes , "
48958	49029	48904	48904	she	152	" Well , there are different kinds of electric shocks - some that are remedial , some that are fatal . There are cures performed by a careful use of the electric battery - again , people are struck dead by lightning , which is the fatal result of electric force . But all this is EXTERNAL electricity ; now what Casimir will use on you will be INTERNAL electricity . "
49042	49156	49038	49038	She	152	" You have internally a certain amount of electricity , which has been increased recently by the remedies prescribed for you by Casimir . But , however much you have , Casimir has more , and he will exert his force over your force , the greater over the lesser . You will experience an INTERNAL electric shock , which , like a sword , will separate in twain body and spirit . The spiritual part of you will be lifted up above material forces ; the bodily part will remain inert and useless , till the life , which is actually YOU , returns to put its machinery in motion once more . "
49157	49165	49166	49166	I	0	" But shall I return at all ? "
49171	49243	49038	49038	She	152	" You must return , because God has fixed the limits of your life on earth , and no human power can alter His decree . Casimir 's will can set you free for a time , but only for a time . You are bound to return , be it never so reluctantly . Eternal liberty is given by Death alone , and Death can not be forced to come . "
49244	49249	49250	49250	I	0	" How about suicide ? "
49253	49257	49259	49259	Zara	152	" The suicide , "
49261	49373	49259	49259	Zara	152	" has no soul . He kills his body , and by the very act proves that whatever germ of an immortal existence he may have had once , has escaped from its unworthy habitation , and gone , like a flying spark , to find a chance of growth elsewhere . Surely your own reason proves this to you ? The very animals have more soul than a man who commits suicide . The beasts of prey slay each other for hunger or in self - defence , but they do not slay themselves . That is a brutality left to man alone , with its companion degradation , drunkenness . "
49380	49390	49391	49391	I	0	" In all the wickedness and cruelty of mankind , "
49394	49440	49391	49391	I	0	" it is almost a wonder that there is any spiritual existence left on earth at all . Why should God trouble Himself to care for such few souls as thoroughly believe in and love Him ? - they can be but a mere handful . "
49441	49455	49457	49457	Zara	152	" Such a mere handful are worth more than the world to him , "
49460	49493	49457	49457	Zara	152	" Oh , my dear , do not say such things as why should God trouble Himself ? Why do you trouble yourself for the safety and happiness of anyone you love ? "
49529	49548	49526	49526	I	0	" Tell me , Zara , what is that stone you always wear ? Is it a talisman ? "
49549	49556	49558	49558	Zara	152	" It belonged to a king , "
49561	49610	49558	49558	Zara	152	" at least , it was found in a king 's coffin . It has been in our family for generations . Casimir says it is an electric stone - there are such still to be found in remote parts of the sea . Do you like it ? "
49611	49619	49620	49620	I	0	" It is very brilliant and lovely , "
49623	49628	49631	49631	Zara	152	" When I die , "
49634	49642	49631	49631	Zara	152	" I will leave it to you . "
49643	49661	49662	49662	I	0	" I hope I shall have to wait a long time before I get it , then , "
49669	49680	49662	49662	I	0	" Indeed , I will pray never to receive it . "
49681	49687	49689	49689	Zara	152	" You will pray wrongly , "
49693	49712	49689	49689	Zara	152	" But tell me , do you quite understand from my explanation what Casimir will do to you ? "
49713	49719	49662	49662	I	0	" I think I do . "
49720	49727	49689	49689	Zara	152	" And you are not afraid ? "
49728	49739	49662	49662	I	0	" Not at all . Shall I suffer any pain ? "
49740	49764	49689	49689	Zara	152	" No actual pang . You will feel giddy for a moment , and your body will become unconscious . That is all . "
49803	49913	49789	49789	I	0	" L'audace , l'audace , et toujours l'audace ! That must be my motto , Zara . I have a chance now of proving how far a woman 's bravery can go , and I assure you I am proud of the opportunity . Your brother uttered some very cutting remarks on the general inaptitude of the female sex when I first made his acquaintance ; so , for the honour of the thing , I must follow the path I have begun to tread . A plunge into the unseen world is surely a bold step for a woman , and I am determined to take it courageously . "
49914	49919	49921	49921	Zara	152	" That is well , "
49923	49948	49921	49921	Zara	152	" I do not think it possible for you ever to regret it . It is growing late - shall we prepare for dinner ? "

50886	50891	50892	50892	she	152	" Indeed , Prince , "
50896	50956	50892	50892	she	152	" you mistake me . I always listen with pleasure to your singing - to - night , perhaps , my mood is more fitted to music than is usual with me , and thus I may appear to you to be more attentive . But your voice always delights me as it must delight everybody who hears it . "
50957	50967	50969	50970	Prince Ivan	153	" While you are in a musical mood then , "
50972	51077	50969	50970	Prince Ivan	153	" let me sing you an English song - one of the loveliest ever penned . I have set it to music myself , as such words are not of the kind to suit ordinary composers or publishers ; they are too much in earnest , too passionate , too full of real human love and sorrow . The songs that suit modern drawing - rooms and concert - halls , as a rule , are those that are full of sham sentiment - a real , strong , throbbing HEART pulsing through a song is too terribly exciting for lackadaisical society . Listen ! "
51102	51107	51098	51098	he	153	" Leave - Taking , "
51185	51259	51180	51180	his	153	" Let us go hence and rest ; she will not love . She shall not hear us if we sing hereof , Nor see love 's ways , how sore they are and steep . Come hence , let be , lie still ; it is enough . Love is a barren sea , bitter and deep ; And though she saw all heaven in flower above , She would not love ! "
51404	51426	51443	51443	he	708	" I must leave you to entertain yourselves for ten minutes while I answer this letter . Will you excuse me ? "

51539	51548	51535	51535	I	0	" I never saw her leave the room . "
51549	51553	51554	51554	he	708	" I did , "
51557	51592	51554	51554	he	708	" She slipped out like a ghost , or a witch , or an angel , while I was singing the last verse of Swinburne 's song . Do you know Swinburne , mademoiselle ? "

51665	51696	51655	51655	his	708	" I have often wondered if poets feel what they write - whether Swinburne , for instance , ever felt the weight of a dead cold thing within him HERE , "
51705	51738	51739	51739	I	0	" and realized that he had to drag that corpse of unburied love with him everywhere - even to the grave , and beyond - O God ! - beyond the grave ! "

51771	51821	51768	51768	I	0	" you are excited and overwrought . Zara meant no slight to you in leaving the room before your song was finished . I am quite sure of that . She is kindness itself - her nature is all sweetness and gentleness . She would not willingly offend you - "
51822	51826	51827	51827	he	708	" Offend me ! "

51973	52034	51967	51967	he	708	" Stay here , you ! If Casimir returns , tell him I have gone for a walk of half an hour . Play to him - keep him occupied - be my friend in this one thing - I trust you . Let him not seek for Zara , or for me . I shall not be long absent . "
52035	52038	52039	52039	I	0	" Stay ! "

52114	52162	52108	52108	He	153	" Did you ever hear that line of poetry which speaks of ' A woman wailing for her demon - lover ' ? That is what Zara does . Of one thing I am certain - she does not wail or wait long ; he comes quickly . "

53031	53227	53028	53028	she	152	" again and again that it is impossible . You waste your life in the pursuit of a phantom ; for a phantom I must be to you always - a mere dream , not a woman such as your love would satisfy . You are a strong man , in sound health and spirits ; you care for the world and the things that are in it . I do not . You would make me happy , you say . No doubt you would do your best - your wealth and influence , your good looks , your hospitable and friendly nature would make most women happy . But what should I care for your family diamonds ? for your surroundings ? for your ambitions ? The society of the world fills me with disgust and prejudice . Marriage , as the world considers it , shocks and outrages my self - respect ; the idea of a bodily union without that of souls is to me repulsive and loathsome . Why , therefore , waste your time in seeking a love which does not exist , which never will exist for you ? "
53241	53341	53236	53237	Prince Ivan	153	" One light kindles another , Zara ! The sunlight melts the snow ! I can not believe but that a long and faithful love may - nay , MUST - have its reward at last . Even according to your brother 's theories , the emotion of love is capable of powerful attraction . Can not I hope that my passion - so strong , so great , so true , Zara ! - will , with patience , draw you , star of my life , closer and closer , till I at last call you mine ? "
53362	53455	53355	53355	she	152	" You speak ignorantly , Prince . Your studies with Casimir appear to have brought you little knowledge . Attraction ! How can you attract what is not in your sphere ? As well ask for the Moons of Jupiter or the Ring of Saturn ! The laws of attraction and repulsion , Prince Ivan , are fixed by a higher authority than yours , and you are as powerless to alter or abate them by one iota , as a child is powerless to repel the advancing waves of the sea . "
53470	53714	53462	53462	his	153	" You may talk as you will , beautiful Zara ; but you shall never persuade me against my reason . I am no dreamer ; no speculator in aerial nothings ; no clever charlatan like Casimir , who , because he is able to magnetize a dog , pretends to the same authority over human beings , and dares to risk the health , perhaps the very sanity , of his own sister , and that of the unfortunate young musician whom he has inveigled in here , all for the sake of proving his dangerous , almost diabolical , experiments . Oh , yes ; I see you are indignant , but I speak truth . I am a plain man ; - and if I am deficient in electric germs , as Casimir would say , I have plenty of common sense . I wish to rescue you , Zara . You are becoming a prey to morbid fancies ; your naturally healthy mind is full of extravagant notions concerning angels and demons and what not ; and your entire belief in , and enthusiasm for , your brother is a splendid advertisement for him . Let me tear the veil of credulity from your eyes . Let me teach you how good a thing it is to live and love and laugh like other people , and leave electricity to the telegraph - wires and the lamp - posts . "
53807	53816	53817	53817	she	152	" Your insults to my brother , Prince , "
53821	54004	53817	53817	she	152	" I suffer to pass by me , knowing well to what a depth of wilful blind ignorance you are fallen . I pity you - and - I despise you ! You are indeed a plain man , as you say - nothing more and nothing less . You can take advantage of the hospitality of this house , and pretend friendship to the host , while you slander him behind his back , and insult his sister in the privacy of her own apartment . Very manlike , truly ; and perfectly in accordance with a reasonable being who likes to live and love and laugh according to the rule of society - a puppet whose wires society pulls , and he dances or dies as society pleases . I told you a gulf existed between us - you have widened it , for which I thank you ! As I do not impose any of my wishes upon you , and therefore can not request you to leave the room , you must excuse me if I retire elsewhere . "
54054	54059	54060	54060	he	708	" No , Zara ! "
54069	54101	54060	54060	he	708	" If you think to escape me so , you are in error . I came to you reckless and resolved ! You shall be mine if I die for it ! "
54134	54139	54140	54140	she	891	" I warn you ! "
54143	54192	54140	54140	she	891	" By the intense loathing I have for you ; by the force which makes my spirit rise in arms against you , I warn you ! Do not dare to touch me ! If you care for your own life , leave me while there is time ! "

54557	54574	54554	54554	Zara	152	" and I am glad of it . I wished you to see and hear all . "

54657	54715	54651	54651	Zara	152	" Yes , he will recover - do not fret , little one . I have rung my private bell for Casimir ; he will be here directly . The Prince has had a shock - not a fatal one , as you will see . You look doubtful - are you afraid of me , dear ? "
54756	54766	54767	54767	I	0	" I am not afraid of you , Zara , "
54771	54796	54767	54767	I	0	" I love you too well for that . But I am sorry for the poor Prince ; and I can not understand - - "
54797	54812	54814	54814	Zara	152	" You can not understand why those who trespass against fixed laws should suffer ? "
54817	54852	54814	54814	Zara	152	" Well , you will understand some day . You will know that in one way or another it is the reason of all suffering , both physical and mental , in the world . "
54898	54905	54906	54906	he	104	" Has he been long thus ? "
54913	54918	54920	54920	Zara	152	" Not five minutes , "
54934	54938	54939	54939	he	104	" Reckless boy ! "
54956	54976	54944	54944	he	104	" He is the very type of misguided human bravery . You were too hard upon him , Zara ! "
54980	54986	54987	54987	she	152	" He spoke against you , "
54990	54996	54998	54999	her brother	703	" Of course he did , "
55004	55090	54998	54999	her brother	703	" And it was perfectly natural he should do so . Have I not read his thoughts ? Do not I know that he considers me a false pretender and CHARLATAN ? And have I not humoured him ? In this he is no worse than any one of his race . Every great scientific discovery is voted impossible at the first start . Ivan is not to blame because he is like the rest of the world . He will be wiser in time . "
55091	55099	55101	55101	Zara	152	" He attempted to force his desires , "
55110	55114	55116	55117	her brother	703	" I know , "
55119	55168	55116	55117	her brother	703	" I foresaw how it would be , but was powerless to prevent it . He was wrong - but bold ! Such boldness compels a certain admiration . This fellow would scale the stars , if he knew how to do it , by physical force alone . "
55178	55187	55188	55188	I	0	" Perhaps he is scaling the stars now , "
55191	55208	55188	55188	I	0	" or at any rate he will do so if death can show him the way . "
55216	55232	55233	55233	he	104	" You also are growing courageous when you can speak to your physician thus abruptly , "
55237	55278	55233	55233	he	104	" Death has nothing to do with our friend as yet , I assure you . Zara , you had better leave us . Your face must not be the first for Ivan 's eyes to rest upon . You , "
55283	55287	55233	55233	he	104	" can stay . "
55551	55558	55559	55559	he	104	" You are better , Ivan ? "
55615	55619	55620	55620	he	708	" Tell me , "
55626	55632	55620	55620	he	708	" have I been dreaming ? "
55662	55668	55669	55669	he	104	" Sit down , Ivan , "
55805	55811	55812	55812	he	708	" Forgive me , Casimir ! "
55839	55846	55847	55847	he	104	" Say no more , Ivan , "
55864	55928	55850	55850	his	104	" We must all learn before we can know , and some of our lessons are sharp and difficult . Whatever you have thought of me , remember I have not , and do not , blame you . To be offended with unbelievers is to show that you are not yourself quite sure of the faith to which you would compel them . "
55929	55937	55940	55941	the Prince	708	" I would ask you one thing , "
55949	55983	55940	55941	the Prince	708	" Do not let me stay to fall into fresh errors . Teach me - guide me , Casimir ; I will be the most docile of your pupils . As for Zara - "
55991	55996	55998	55998	Heliobas	104	" Come with me , "
56004	56037	55998	55998	Heliobas	104	" a glass of good wine will invigorate you . It is better to see Zara no more for a time . Let me take charge of you . You , mademoiselle , "
56042	56070	56071	56071	he	708	" will be kind enough to tell Zara that the Prince has recovered , and sends her a friendly good - night . Will that message suffice ? "
56100	56106	56107	56107	he	708	" You will embrace her , "
56111	56192	56107	56107	he	708	" without fear . Her eyes will rain sunshine upon you ; they will not dart lightning . Her lips will meet yours , and their touch will be warm - not cold , as sharp steel . Yes ; bid her good - night for me ; tell her that an erring man kisses the hem of her robe , and prays her for pardon . Tell her that I understand ; tell her I have seen her lover ! "
56193	56236	56262	56262	Heliobas	104	" With these words , uttered distinctly and emphatically , he turned away with . Heliobas , who still held him by the arm in a friendly , half - protecting manner . The tears stood in my eyes . I called softly :
56237	56245	56107	56107	he	708	" Good - night , Prince Ivan ! "
56254	56261	56262	56262	Heliobas	104	" Good - night , mademoiselle ! "
56282	56288	56262	56262	Heliobas	104	" Do not be anxious , "
56289	56297	56262	56262	Heliobas	104	" He will be all right soon , "
56299	56305	56306	56306	I	0	" Always believe the best . "
56368	56377	56378	56378	I	0	" Are you sorry for him , Zara ? "
56381	56384	56385	56385	she	152	" Yes , "
56388	56420	56385	56385	she	152	" I am sorry for him as far as I can be sorry for anything . I am never actually VERY sorry for any circumstances , however grievous they may appear . "
56428	56433	56434	56434	I	0	" Why , Zara , "
56437	56446	56434	56434	I	0	" I thought you were so keenly sympathetic ? "
56447	56566	56421	56421	I	0	" So I am sympathetic , but only with suffering ignorance - a dying bird that knows not why it should die - a withering rose that sees not the reason for its withering ; but for human beings who wilfully blind themselves to the teachings of their own instincts , and are always doing what they know they ought not to do in spite of warning , I can not say I am sorry . And for those who DO study the causes and ultimate results of their existence , there is no occasion to be sorry , as they are perfectly happy , knowing everything that happens to them to be for their advancement and justification . "
56567	56571	56572	56572	I	0	" Tell me , "
56579	56595	56572	56572	I	0	" what did Prince Ivan mean by saying he had seen your lover , Zara ? "
56596	56606	56608	56608	Zara	152	" He meant what he said , I suppose , "
56614	56627	56608	56608	Zara	152	" Excuse me , I thought you said you were not inquisitive . "
56653	56723	56640	56640	I	0	" You shall not get angry with ME , Zara . I am not going to be treated like poor Ivan . I have found out what you are , and how dangerous it is to admire you ; but I do admire and love you . And I defy you to knock me down as unceremoniously as you did the Prince - you beautiful living bit of Lightning ! "
56765	56772	56773	56773	she	152	" What have you found out ? "
56776	56782	56773	56773	she	152	" What do you know ? "
56783	56791	56792	56792	I	0	" I can not say I KNOW , "
56804	56858	56792	56792	I	0	" but I have made a guess which I think comes near the truth . Your brother has had the care of you ever since you were a little child , and I believe he has , by some method known only to himself , charged you with electricity . Yes , Zara , "
56872	56999	56860	56860	she	152	" and it is that which keeps you young and fresh as a girl of sixteen , at an age when other women lose their bloom and grow wrinkles . It is that which gives you the power to impart a repelling shock to people you dislike , as in the case of Prince Ivan . It is that which gives you such an attractive force for those with whom you have a little sympathy - such as myself , for instance ; and you can not , Zara , with all your electric strength , unclasp my arms from your waist , because you have not the sentiment of repulsion towards me which would enable you to do it . Shall I go on guessing ? "
57027	57031	57032	57032	I	0	" Your lover , "
57039	57106	57107	57107	I	0	" is a native of some other sphere - perhaps a creation of your own fancy - perhaps for I will not be sceptical any more a beautiful and all - powerful angelic spirit . I will not discuss this with you . I believe that when Prince Ivan fell senseless , he saw , or fancied he saw , that nameless being . And now , "
57116	57122	57107	57107	I	0	" have I guessed well ? "
57127	57133	57134	57134	she	152	" I do not know , "
57137	57143	57134	57134	she	152	" why you should imagine - "
57144	57147	57148	57148	I	0	" Stop ! "
57151	57219	57148	57148	I	0	" there is no imagination in the case . I have reasoned it out . Here is a book I found in the library on electric organs as they are discovered to exist in certain fish . Listen : ' They are nervous apparatuses which in the arrangement of their parts may be compared to a Voltaic pile . They develop electricity and give electrical discharges . ' "
57220	57223	57225	57225	Zara	152	" Well ! "
57227	57241	57242	57242	I	0	" You say ' Well ! ' as if you did not know ! "
57252	57347	57242	57242	I	0	" These fish have helped me to understand a great deal , I assure you . Your brother must have discovered the seed or commencement of electrical organs like those described , in the human body ; and he has cultivated them in you and in himself , and has brought them to a high state of perfection . He has cultivated them in Raffaello Cellini , and he is beginning to cultivate them in me , and I hope most sincerely he will succeed . I think his theory is a magnificent one ! "
57369	57379	57380	57380	she	152	" Supposing you had reasoned out the matter correctly , "
57383	57442	57380	57380	she	152	" and I will not deny that you have done a great deal towards the comprehension of it - have you no fear ? do you not include some drawbacks in even Casimir 's learning such a secret , and being able to cultivate and educate such a deadly force as that of electricity in the human being ? "
57443	57456	57457	57457	I	0	" If it is deadly , it is also life - giving , "
57460	57516	57457	57457	I	0	" Remedies are also poisons . You laid the Prince senseless at your feet , but your brother raised him up again . Both these things were done by electricity . I can understand it all now ; I see no obscurity , no mystery . And oh , what a superb discovery it is ! "
57520	57524	57525	57525	she	152	" You enthusiast ! "
57528	57778	57525	57525	she	152	" it is nothing new . It was well known to the ancient Chaldeans . It was known to Moses and his followers ; it was practised in perfection by Christ and His disciples . To modern civilization it may seem a discovery , because the tendency Of all so - called progress is to forget the past . The scent of the human savage is extraordinarily keen - keener than that of any animal - he can follow a track unerringly by some odour he is able to detect in the air . Again , he can lay back his ears to the wind and catch a faint , far - off sound with , certainty and precision , and tell you what it is . Civilized beings have forgotten all this ; they can neither smell nor hear with actual keenness . Just in the same way , they have forgotten the use of the electrical organs they all indubitably possess in large or minute degree . As the muscles of the arm are developed by practice , so can the wonderful internal electrical apparatus of man be strengthened and enlarged by use . The world in its youth knew this ; the world in its age forgets , as an old man forgets or smiles disdainfully at the past sports of his childhood . But do not let us talk any more to - night . If you think your ideas of me are correct - - "
57779	57786	57787	57787	I	0	" I am sure they are ! "
57799	57808	57809	57809	she	152	" And you are sure you love me ? "
57821	57824	57825	57825	I	0	" Sure ! "
57828	57858	57825	57825	I	0	" Zara , I love and honour you more than any woman I ever met or ever shall meet . And you love me - I know you do ! "
57859	57866	57867	57867	she	152	" How can I help it ? "
57870	57887	57867	57867	she	152	" Are you not one of us ? Good - night , dearest ! Sleep well ! "
57888	57893	57894	57894	I	0	" Good - night ! "
57897	57907	57894	57894	I	0	" And remember Prince Ivan asked for your pardon . "
57908	57912	57913	57913	she	152	" I remember ! "
57917	57931	57913	57913	she	152	" I have already pardoned him , and I will pray for him . "
58336	58347	58348	58348	she	152	" All the nice people are going away from here , "
58351	58502	58348	58348	she	152	" Madame Didier and her husband have started for Naples ; and , to crown our lonesomeness , Raffaello Cellini packed up all his traps , and left us yesterday morning en route for Rome . The weather continues to be delicious ; but as you seem to be getting on so well in Paris , in spite of the cold there , we have made up our minds to join you , the more especially as I want to renovate my wardrobe . We shall go straight to the Grand Hotel ; and I am writing to Mrs. Challoner by this post , asking her to get us rooms . We are so glad you are feeling nearly recovered - of course , you must not leave your physician till you are quite ready . At any rate , we shall not arrive till the end of next week . "
58591	58593	58582	58583	Mrs. Challoner	156	" Improvisation "
58623	58659	58609	58609	I	0	" Is it not rather a sudden freak of Raffaello Cellini 's to leave Cannes ? We all thought he was settled for the winter there . Did you know he was going to Rome ? "
58660	58663	58665	58665	Heliobas	104	" Yes , "
58674	58694	58668	58668	he	104	" I knew he was going there some day this month ; his presence is required there on business . "
58695	58711	58713	58713	Zara	152	" And are you going to give the Improvisation this Mrs. Challoner asks you for ? "
58725	58736	58737	58737	he	104	" I should certainly give it if I were you , "
58741	58756	58737	58737	he	104	" there will be nothing to prevent your doing so at the date named . "
58916	58923	58924	58924	He	104	" The eight days are accomplished ! "
58943	59032	58924	58924	He	104	" My child , I am aware of it . I expect you in my private room at noon . In the meantime speak to no one - not even to Zara ; read no books ; touch no note of music . The chapel has been prepared for you ; go there and pray . When you see a small point of light touch the extreme edge of the cross upon the altar , it will be twelve o'clock , and you will then come to me . "
59356	59362	59375	59375	I	0	" Gloria in excelsis Deo ! "
59852	59859	59860	59860	I	0	" Let me believe and love ! "
59923	59930	59920	59920	I	0	" Let me believe and love ! "
60222	60228	60229	60229	I	0	" Your book is open , "
60232	60268	60229	60229	I	0	" at a passage commencing thus : ' The universe is upheld solely by the Law of Love . A majestic invisible Protectorate governs the winds , the tides . ' Is it not so ? "
60269	60274	60276	60276	Heliobas	104	" It is so , "
60278	60286	60276	60276	Heliobas	104	" Are you acquainted with the book ? "
60287	60299	60300	60300	I	0	" Only through the dream I had of you at Cannes , "
60303	60315	60300	60300	I	0	" I do think Signor Cellini had some power over me . "
60316	60377	60386	60386	he	963	" Of course he had in your then weak state . But now that you are as strong as he is , he could not influence you at all . Let us be brief in our converse , my child . I have a few serious things to say to you before you leave me , on your celestial journey . "
60405	60408	60410	60410	Heliobas	104	" Listen , "
60412	60459	60410	60410	Heliobas	104	" I told you , when you first came here , that whatever I might do to restore you to health , you would have it in your power to repay me amply . You ARE restored to health ; will you give me my reward ? "
60460	60474	60475	60475	I	0	" I would and will do anything to prove my gratitude to you , "
60479	60485	60475	60475	I	0	" Only tell me how . "
60486	60491	60492	60492	he	104	" You are aware , "
60496	60725	60492	60492	he	104	" of my theories respecting the Electric Spirit or Soul in Man . It is progressive , as I have told you - it begins as a germ - it goes on increasing in power and beauty for ever , till it is great and pure enough to enter the last of all worlds - God 's World . But there are sometimes hindrances to its progression - obstacles in its path , which cause it to recoil and retire a long way back - so far back occasionally that it has to commence its journey over again . Now , by my earnest researches , I am able to study and watch the progress of my own inner force or soul . So far , all has been well - prayerfully and humbly I may say I believe all has been well . But I foresee an approaching shadow - a difficulty - a danger - which , if it can not be repelled or passed in some way , threatens to violently push back my advancing spiritual nature , so that , with much grief and pain , I shall have to re - commence the work that I had hoped was done . I can not , with all my best effort , discover WHAT this darkening obstacle is - but YOU , yes , YOU "
60735	60874	60492	60492	he	104	" you , when you are lifted up high enough to behold these things , may , being perfectly unselfish in this research , attain to the knowledge of it and explain it to me , when you return . In trying to probe the secret for myself , it is of course purely for my own interest ; and nothing clear , nothing satisfactory can be spiritually obtained , in which selfishness has ever so slight a share . You , if indeed I deserve your gratitude for the aid I have given you - you will be able to search out the matter more certainly , being in the position of one soul working for another . Still , I can not compel you to do this for me - I only ask , WILL you ? "
60926	60986	60922	60922	I	0	" I will do my best , I promise you . Remember that I do not know , I can not even guess where I am going , or what strange sensations will overcome me ; but if I am permitted to have any recollection of earth at all , I will try to find out what you ask . "
61047	61051	61052	61052	he	104	" Tell me , "
61059	61082	61052	61052	he	104	" tell me WHY you wish to see what to mortals is unseen ? What motive have you ? What ulterior plan ? "
61096	61149	61087	61087	I	0	" I desire to know why this world , this universe exists ; and also wish to prove , if possible , the truth and necessity of religion . And I think I would give my life , if it were worth anything , to be certain of the truth of Christianity . "
61167	61174	61175	61175	he	104	" You have a daring aim , "
61179	61256	61175	61175	he	104	" and you are a bold seeker . But shame , repentance and sorrow await you where you are going , as well as rapture and amazement . ' I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE IF IT WERE WORTH ANYTHING . ' That utterance has saved you - otherwise to soar into an unexplored wilderness of spheres , weighted by your own doubts and guided solely by your own wild desires , would be a fruitless journey . "
61269	61283	61284	61284	I	0	" Surely it is well to wish to know the reason of things ? "
61291	61303	61304	61304	he	104	" The desire of knowledge is a great virtue , certainly , "
61307	61393	61304	61304	he	104	" it is not truly felt by one in a thousand . Most persons are content to live and die , absorbed in their own petty commonplace affairs , without troubling themselves as to the reasons of their existence . Yet it is almost better , like these , to wallow in blind ignorance than wantonly to doubt the Creator because He is unseen , or to put a self - opinionated construction on His mysteries because He chooses to veil them from our eyes . "
61394	61400	61401	61401	I	0	" I do not doubt ! "
61405	61421	61401	61401	I	0	" I only want to make sure , and then perhaps I may persuade others . "

61434	61507	61431	61431	Heliobas	104	" You are going to see wonderful things that no tongue or pen can adequately describe . Well , when you return to earth again , do you suppose you can make people believe the story of your experiences ? Never ! Be thankful if you are the possessor of a secret joy yourself , and do not attempt to impart it to others , who will only repel and mock you . "
61508	61515	61516	61516	I	0	" Not even to one other ? "
61536	61555	61556	61556	he	104	" Yes , to one other , the other half of yourself - you may tell all things , "
61559	61576	61556	61556	he	104	" But now , no more converse . If you are quite ready , drink this . "
61747	61857	61740	61740	his	104	" Azul ! Azul ! Lift up this light and daring spirit unto thyself ; be its pioneer upon the path it must pursue ; suffer it to float untrammelled through the wide and glorious Continents of Air ; give it form and force to alight on any of the vast and beautiful spheres it may desire to behold ; and if worthy , permit it to gaze , if only for a brief interval , upon the supreme vision of the First and Last of worlds . By the force thou givest unto me , I free this soul ; do thou , Azul , quickly receive it ! "

62196	62238	62179	62179	I	0	" How came I shut in such a prison ? How poor a form - how destitute of faculties - how full of infirmities - how limited in capabilities - how narrow in all intelligence - how ignorant - how mean ! "
62358	62363	62365	62368	the voice beside me	972	" Askest thou nothing ? "
62370	62374	62375	62375	I	0	" Tell me , "

62385	62392	62365	62368	the voice beside me	972	" These spirits that we behold , "
62398	62581	62365	62368	the voice beside me	972	" are the guardians of all the inhabitants of all the planets . Their labours are those of love and penitence . Their work is to draw other souls to God - to attract them by warnings , by pleading , by praying . They have all worn the garb of mortality themselves , and they teach mortals by their own experience . For these radiant creatures are expiating sins of their own in thus striving to save others - the oftener they succeed the nearer they approach to Heaven . This is what is vaguely understood on your earth as purgatory ; the sufferings of spirits who love and long for the presence of their Creator , and who yet are not pure enough to approach Him . Only by serving and saving others can they obtain at last their own joy . Every act of ingratitude and forgetfulness and wickedness committed by a mortal , detains one or another of these patient workers longer away from Heaven - imagine then what a weary while many of them have to wait . "
62888	62896	62897	62897	I	0	" Remind me why these wonders exist , "
62920	62948	62897	62897	I	0	" and why amid them all the Earth is believed by its inhabitants to have merited destruction , and yet to have been found worthy of redemption ? "
62949	62958	62960	62960	Azul	106	" Thy last question shall be answered first , "
62962	62997	62960	62960	Azul	106	" Seest thou yonder planet circled with a ring ? It is known to the dwellers on Earth , of whom when in clay thou art one , as Saturn . Descend with me ! "
63080	63088	63090	63092	that radiant guide	981	" To these children of the Creator , "
63094	63311	63090	63092	that radiant guide	981	" is granted the ability to see and to converse with the spirits of the air . They know them and love them , and implore their protection . In this planet sickness and old age are unknown , and death comes as a quiet sleep . The period of existence is about two hundred years , according to the Earth 's standard of time ; and the process of decay is no more unlovely than the gentle withering of roses . The influence of the electric belt around their world is a bar to pestilence and disease , and scatters health with light . All sciences , arts , and inventions known on Earth are known here , only to greater perfection . The three important differences between the inhabitants of this planet and those who dwell on Earth are these : first they have no rulers in authority , as each one perfectly governs himself ; second , they do not marry , as the law of attraction which draws together any two of opposite sexes , holds them fast in inviolable fidelity ; thirdly , there is no creature in all the immensity of this magnificent sphere who has ever doubted , or who ever will doubt , the existence of the Creator . "
63975	63991	63993	63993	Azul	106	" Readest thou the lesson in these glowing spheres , teeming with life and learning ? "
64004	64206	63993	63993	Azul	106	" Know that not one smallest world in all the myriad systems circling before thee , holds a single human creature who doubts his Maker . Not one ! except thine own doomed star ! Behold it yonder - sparkling feebly , like a faint flame amid sunshine - how poor a speck it is - how like a scarcely visible point in all the brilliancy of the ever - revolving wheel of Life ! Yet there dwell the dwarfs of clay - the men and women who pretend to love while they secretly hate and despise one another . There , wealth is a god , and the greed of gain a virtue . There , genius starves , and heroism dies unrewarded . There , faith is martyred , and unbelief elected sovereign monarch of the people . There , the sublime , unreachable mysteries of the Universe are haggled over by poor finite minds who can not call their lives their own . There , nation wars against nation , creed against creed , soul against soul . Alas , fated planet ! how soon shalt thou be extinct , and thy place shall know thee no more ! "
64215	64221	64222	64222	I	0	" If that is true , "
64225	64257	64222	64222	I	0	" why then should we have a legend that God , in the person of one called Christ , came to die for so miserable and mean a race of beings ? "

64360	64462	64472	64472	I	0	" because I will not that no atom of true worth should perish , unto thee shall be given a vision - unto thee shall be taught a lesson thou dreamest not of . THOU shalt create ; THOU shalt design and plan ; THOU shalt be worshipped , and THOU shalt destroy ! Rest therefore in the light and behold the things that are in the light , for the tune cometh when all that seemeth clear and visible now shall be but darkness . And they that love me not shall have no place of abode in that hour ! "
64770	64773	64755	64755	angels	289	" CREATE ! "

Let me strive once more to bring them out of their darkness into the light - to bring them to the happiness I designed them to enjoy . They have not all forgotten me - let me give them more time for thought and recollection ! "

This garden of thine is but a caprice of thy intelligence ; the creatures that inhabit it are soulless and unworthy , and are an offence to that indestructible radiance of which thou art one ray . Therefore I say unto thee again - DESTROY ! "
66125	66132	66133	66133	I	0	" Oh , thou Unseen Glory ! "
66136	66264	66133	66133	I	0	" thou who hast filled me with this emotion of love and pity which permeates and supports my existence , how canst thou bid me take this sudden revenge upon my frail creation ! No caprice was it that caused me to design it ; nothing but a thought of love and a desire of beauty . Even yet I will fulfil my plan - even yet shall these erring children of mine return to me in time , with patience . While one of them still lifts a hand in prayer to me , or gratitude , I can not destroy ! Bid me rather sink into the darkness of the uttermost deep of shadow ; only let me save these feeble little ones from destruction ! "

66361	66398	66358	66358	I	0	" if I understood death , I would die to save one of those frail creatures , who seek to know me and yet can not find me through the darkness they have brought upon themselves . "

66408	66467	66405	66406	the Angel	1080	" to understand death , thou wouldst need to become one of them , to take upon thyself their form - to imprison all that brilliancy of which thou art now composed , into a mean and common case of clay ; and even if thou couldst accomplish this , would thy children know thee or receive thee ? "
66468	66480	66481	66481	I	0	" Nay , but if I could suffer shame by them , "
66485	66561	66481	66481	I	0	" I could not suffer sin . My being would be incapable of error , and I would show these creatures of mine the bliss of purity , the joy of wisdom , the ecstasy of light , the certainty of immortality , if they followed me . And then I would die to show them death is easy , and that in dying they would come to me and find their happiness for ever ! "

66658	67039	66655	66656	the Angel	1080	" thou who art but one point of living light in the Supreme Radiance , even THOU wouldst consent to immure thyself in the darkness of mortality for sake of thy fancied creation ! Even THOU wouldst submit to suffer and to die , in order to show the frail children of thy dream a purely sinless and spiritual example ! Even THOU hast had the courage to plead with the One All - Sufficing Voice against the destruction of what to thee was but a mirage floating in this ether ! Even THOU hast had love , forgiveness , pity ! Even THOU wouldst be willing to dwell among the creatures of thy fancy as one of them , knowing in thy inner self that by so doing , thy spiritual presence would have marked thy little world for ever as sanctified and impossible to destroy . Even THOU wouldst sacrifice a glory to answer a child 's prayer - even thou wouldst have patience ! And yet thou hast dared to deny to God those attributes which thou thyself dost possess - He is so great and vast - thou so small and slight ! For the love thou feelest throbbing through thy being , He is the very commencement and perfection of all love ; if thou hast pity , He has ten thousand times more pity ; if THOU canst forgive , remember that from Him flows all thy power of forgiveness ! There is nothing thou canst do , even at the highest height of spiritual perfection , that He can not surpass by a thousand million fold ! Neither shalt thou refuse to believe that He can also suffer . Know that nothing is more godlike than unselfish sorrow - and the grief of the Creator over one erring human soul is as vast as He Himself is vast . Why wouldst thou make of Him a being destitute of the best emotions that He Himself bestows upon thee ? THOU wouldst have entered into thy dream - world and lived in it and died in it , if by so doing thou couldst have drawn one of thy creatures back to the love of thee ; and wilt thou not receive the Christ ? "
67054	67064	67065	67065	I	0	" I believe - I believe and I love ! "
67068	67099	67065	67065	I	0	" Desert me not , O radiant Angel ! I feel and know that all these wonders must soon pass away from my sight ; but wilt thou also go ? "
67107	67113	67100	67101	The Angel	1080	" I am thy guardian , "
67117	67217	67100	67101	The Angel	1080	" I have been with thee always . I can never leave thee so long as thy soul seeks spiritual things . Asleep or awake on the Earth , wherever thou art , I also am . There have been times when I have warned thee and thou wouldst not listen , when I have tried to draw thee onward and thou wouldst not come ; but now I fear no more thy disobedience , for thy restlessness is past . Come with me ; it is permitted thee to see far off the vision of the Last Circle . "
67340	67350	67353	67353	Angel	195	" They are all born of the Great Circle , "
67358	67452	67353	67353	Angel	195	" and to them is given the power of communicating high thought or inspiration . Among them are the Spirits of Music , of Poesy , of Prophecy , and of all Art ever known in all worlds . The success of their teaching depends on how much purity and unselfishness there is in the soul to which they whisper their divine messages - messages as brief as telegrams which must be listened to with entire attention and acted upon at once , or the lesson is lost and may never come again . "
67534	67539	67587	67589	The young Shape	1096	" What seekest thou ? "

67610	67709	67587	67589	The young Shape	1096	" The pity I shall feel for thy fate when thou art again pent in clay , shall be taught thee in minor music - thou shalt possess the secret of unwritten sound , and I will sing to thee and bring thee comfort . On Earth , call but my name - Aeon ! and thou shalt behold me . For thy longing voice is known to the Children of Music , and hath oft shaken the vibrating light wherein they dwell . Fear not ! As long as thou dost love me , I am thine . "
67747	67750	67760	67760	Azul	106	" Welcome ! "
67813	67816	67818	67819	my guardian	1093	" Here , "
67822	67888	67818	67819	my guardian	1093	" here ends thy journey . Would that it were possible , poor Spirit , for thee to pass this boundary ! But that may not be - as yet . In the meanwhile thou mayest gaze for a brief space upon the majestic sphere which mortals dream of as Heaven . Behold and see how fair is the incorruptible perfection of God 's World ! "
68332	68446	68329	68329	I	0	" Send me back again , dear Angel - send me back to that Star of Sorrow and Error ! Let me hasten to make amends there for all my folly - let me try to teach others what now I know . I am unworthy to be here beside thee - I am unfit to look on yonder splendid World - let me return to do penance for my sins and shortcomings ; for what am I that God should bless me ? and though I should consume myself in labour and suffering , how can I ever hope to deserve the smallest place in that heavenly glory I now partly behold ? "
68469	68529	68462	68462	Azul	106	" Now thou dost believe - henceforth thou must love ! Love alone can pass yon flaming barrier - love alone can gain for thee eternal bliss . In love and for love were all things made - God loveth His creatures , even so let His creatures love Him , and so shall the twain be drawn together . "
68530	68533	68535	68538	my Angel - guide	1099	" Listen ! "
68540	68763	68462	68462	Azul	106	" Thou hast not travelled so far as yet to remain in ignorance . That burning Ring thou seest is the result of the Creator 's ever - working Intelligence ; from it all the Universe hath sprung . It is exhaustless and perpetually creative ; it is pure and perfect Light . The smallest spark of that fiery essence in a mortal frame is sufficient to form a soul or spirit , such as mine , or that of Azul , or thine , when thou art perfected . The huge world rolling within the Ring is where God dwells . Dare not thou to question His shape , His look , His mien ! Know that He is the Supreme Spirit in which all Beauty , all Perfection , all Love , find consummation . His breath is the fire of the Ring ; His look , His pleasure , cause the motion of His World and all worlds . There where He dwells , dwell also all pure souls ; there all desires have fulfilment without satiety , and there all loveliness , wisdom or pleasure known in any or all of the other spheres are also known . Speak , Azul , and tell this wanderer from Earth what she will gain in winning her place in Heaven . "
68772	69143	68764	68764	Azul	106	" When thou hast slept the brief sleep of death , when thou art permitted to throw off for ever thy garb of clay , and when by thine own ceaseless love and longing thou hast won the right to pass the Great Circle , thou shalt find thyself in a land where the glories of the natural scenery alone shall overpower thee with joy - scenery that for ever changes into new wonders and greater beauty . Thou shalt hear music such as thou canst not dream of . Thou shalt find friends , beyond all imagination fair and faithful . Thou shalt read and see the history of all the planets , produced for thee in an ever - moving panorama . Thou shalt love and be beloved for ever by thine own Twin Soul ; wherever that spirit may be now , it must join thee hereafter . The joys of learning , memory , consciousness , sleep , waking , and exercise shall all be thine . Sin , sorrow , pain , disease and death thou shalt know no more . Thou shalt be able to remember happiness , to possess it , and to look forward to it . Thou shalt have full and pleasant occupation without fatigue - thy food and substance shall be light and air . Flowers , rare and imperishable , shall bloom for thee ; birds of exquisite form and tender voice shall sing to thee ; angels shall be thy companions . Thou shalt have fresh and glad desires to offer to God with every portion of thy existence , and each one shall be granted as soon as asked , for then thou wilt not be able to ask anything that is displeasing to Him . But because it is a joy to wish , thou shalt wish ! and because it is a joy to grant , so also will He grant . No delight , small or great , is wanting in that vast sphere ; only sorrow is lacking , and satiety and disappointment have no place . Wilt thou seek for admittance there or wilt thou faint by the way and grow weary ? "
69154	69163	69164	69164	I	0	" My mere efforts must count as nothing , "
69167	69188	69164	69164	I	0	" but if Love can help me , I will love and long for God 's World until I die ! "
69215	69328	69189	69190	My guardian	1093	" That is the path by which THOU must travel . Mark it well ! All pilgrims from the Sorrowful Star must journey by that road . Woe to them that turn aside to roam mid spheres they know not of , to lose themselves in seas of light wherein they can not steer ! Remember my warning ! And now , Spirit who art commended to my watchful care , thy brief liberty is ended . Thou hast been lifted up to the outer edge of the Electric Circle , further we dare not take thee . Hast thou aught else to ask before the veil of mortality again enshrouds thee ? "
69366	69375	69376	69376	I	0	" If Love and Faith can avail me , "
69379	69388	69376	69376	I	0	" I shall see what I have sought . "
69532	69631	69632	69632	I	0	" Mortal from the Star I saved from ruin , because thou hast desired Me , I come ! Even as thy former unbelief , shall be now thy faith . Because thou lovest Me , I am with thee . For do I not know thee better than the Angels can ? Have I not dwelt in thy clay , suffered thy sorrows , wept thy tears , died thy deaths ? One with My Father , and yet one with thee , I demand thy love , and so through Me shalt thou attain immortal life ! "
69766	69786	69755	69755	I	0	" Azul , tell me what shadow rests upon the life of him to whom I am now returning ? "
69796	69837	69787	69787	Azul	106	" Thou daring one ! Seekest thou to pierce the future fate of others ? Is it not enough for thee to have heard the voice that maketh the Angel 's singing silent , and wouldst thou yet know more ? "
69852	69883	69848	69848	I	0	" He is thy Beloved one , Azul - thy Twin Soul ; and wilt thou let him fall away from thee when a word or sign might save him ? "
69884	69902	69904	69904	Azul	106	" Even as he is my Beloved , so let him not fail to hear my voice , "
69912	69964	69904	69904	Azul	106	" For though he has accomplished much , he is as yet but mortal . Thou canst guide him thus far ; tell him , when death lies like a gift in his hand , let him withhold it , and remember me . And now , my friend - farewell ! "
70189	70196	70197	70197	I	0	" Have I been long away ? "
70214	70226	70228	70228	Heliobas	104	" I sent you from hence on Thursday morning at noon , "
70230	70282	70228	70228	Heliobas	104	" It is now Friday evening , and within a few minutes of midnight . I was growing alarmed . I have never known anyone stay absent for so long ; and you resisted my authority so powerfully , that I began to fear you would never come back at all . "
70283	70295	70296	70296	I	0	" I wish I had not been compelled to do so ! "
70303	70326	70300	70300	He	104	" No doubt you do . It is the general complaint . Will you stand up now and see how you feel ? "
70382	70390	70391	70391	I	0	" I can never thank you enough ! "
70395	70411	70391	70391	I	0	" I dare say you know something of what I have seen on my journey ? "
70412	70419	70420	70420	he	104	" Something , but not all , "
70423	70458	70420	70420	he	104	" Of course I know what worlds and systems you saw , but what was said to you , or what special lessons were given you for your comfort , I can not tell . "
70459	70472	70473	70473	I	0	" Then I will describe everything while it is fresh upon me , "
70476	70503	70473	70473	I	0	" I feel that I must do so in order that you may understand how glad I am , - how grateful I am to you . "
70536	70735	70738	70738	he	1119	" Yours has been a most wonderful , I may say almost exceptional , experience . It proves to me more than ever the omnipotence of WILL . Most of those who have been placed by my means in the Uplifted or Electric state of being , have consented to it simply to gratify a sense of curiosity - few therefore have gone beyond the pure ether , where , as in a sea , the planets swim . Cellini , for instance , never went farther than Venus , because in the atmosphere of that planet he met the Spirit that rules and divides his destiny . Zara - she was daring , and reached the outer rim of the Great Circle ; but even she never caught a glimpse of the great Central Sphere . YOU , differing from these , started with a daring aim which you never lost sight of till you had fulfilled it . How true are those words : ' Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you ' ! It is not possible , "
70741	70762	70738	70738	he	1119	" that amid such wonders you could have remembered me - it were foolish on my part to expect it . "
70763	70772	70773	70773	I	0	" I confess I thought nothing of you , "
70777	70802	70773	70773	I	0	" till I was approaching Earth again ; but then my memory prompted me in time , and I did not forget your request . "
70803	70810	70811	70811	he	1119	" And what did you learn ? "
70815	70846	70773	70773	I	0	" Simply this . Azul said that I might deliver you this message : When death lies like a gift in your hand , withhold it , and remember her . "
70847	70860	70862	70862	Heliobas	104	" As if I did not always guide myself by her promptings ! "
70869	70879	70880	70880	I	0	" You might forget to do so for once , "
70883	70886	70887	70887	he	1119	" Never ! "
70891	70941	70887	70887	he	1119	" It could not be . But I thank you , my child , for having thought of me - the message you bring shall be impressed strongly on my mind . Now , before you leave me to - night , I must say a few necessary words . "
70959	70969	70970	70970	he	1119	" I have selected certain writings for your perusal , "
70973	71210	70970	70970	he	1119	" In them you will find full and clear instructions how to cultivate and educate the electric force within you , and thus continue the work I have begun . With these you will also perceive that I have written out the receipt for the volatile fluid which , if taken in a small quantity every day , will keep you in health , strength , and intellectual vigour , while it will preserve your youth and enjoyment of life to a very much longer extent than that usually experienced by the majority . Understand me well - this liquid of itself can not put you into an uplifted state of existence ; you need HUMAN electric force applied strongly to your system to compass this ; and as it is dangerous to try the experiment too often - dangerous to the body , I mean - it will be as well , as you have work to do yet in this life , not to attempt it again . But if you drink the fluid every morning of your life , and at the same time obey my written manual as to the cultivation of your own inner force , which is already existent in a large degree , you will attain to certain advantages over the rest of the people you meet , which will give you not only physical , but mental power . "
71223	71616	71617	71617	He	1121	" When you have educated your Will to a certain height of electric command , you can at your pleasure see at any time , and see plainly , the spirits who inhabit the air ; and also those who , descending to long distances below the Great Circle , come within the range of human electricity , or the attractive matter contained in the Earth 's atmosphere . You can converse with them , and they with you . You will also be able , at your desire , to see the parted spirits of dead persons , so long as they linger within Earth 's radius , which they seldom do , being always anxious to escape from it as soon as possible . Love may sometimes detain them , or remorse ; but even these have to yield to the superior longings which possess them the instant they are set free . You will , in your intercourse with your fellow - mortals , be able to discern their motives quickly and unerringly - you will at once discover where you are loved and where you are disliked ; and not all the learning and logic of so - called philosophers shall be able to cloud your instinct . You will have a keener appreciation of good and beautiful things - a delightful sense of humour , and invariable cheerfulness ; and whatever you do , unless you make some mistake by your own folly , will carry with it its success . And , what is perhaps a greater privilege , you will find that all who are brought into very close contact with you will be beneficially influenced , or the reverse , exactly as you choose to exert your power . I do not think , after what you have seen , you will ever desire to exert a malign influence , knowing that the Creator of your being is all love and forgiveness . At any rate , the greatest force in the universe , electricity , is yours - that is , it has begun to form itself in you - and you have nothing to do but to encourage its growth , just as you would encourage a taste for music or the fine arts . Now let me give you the writings . "
71663	71725	71653	71653	he	1121	" This contains my private instructions to you . Never make a single one of them public . The world is not ready for wisdom , and the secrets of science can only be explained to the few . Therefore keep this parchment safely under lock and key , and never let any eye but your own look upon its contents . "
71751	72031	71748	71748	he	1121	" Here is written out what I call the Electric Principle of Christianity . This is for your own study and consideration ; still , if you ever desire to explain my theory to others , I do not forbid you . But as I told you before , you can never compel belief - the goldfish in a glass bowl will never understand the existence of the ocean . Be satisfied if you can guide yourself by the compass you have found , but do not grieve if you are unable to guide others . You may try , but it will not be surprising if you fail . Nor will it be your fault . The only sorrow that might happen to you in these efforts would be in case you should love someone very dearly , and yet be unable to instil the truth of what yon know into that particular soul . You would then have to make a discovery , which is always more or less painful - namely , that your love was misplaced , inasmuch as the nature you had selected as worthy of love had no part with yours ; and that separation utter and eternal must therefore occur , if not in this life , then in the future . So I would say beware of loving , lest you should not love rightly - though I believe you will soon be able to discern clearly the spirit that is by fate destined to complete and perfect your own . And now , though I know you are scarcely fatigued enough to sleep , I will say good - night . "
72066	72077	72063	72063	I	0	" Does Zara know how long I have been absent ? "
72078	72081	72083	72083	Heliobas	104	" Yes , "
72085	72127	72083	72083	Heliobas	104	" and she , like myself , was surprised and anxious . I think she went to bed long ago ; but you may look into her room and see if she is awake , before you yourself retire to rest . "
72151	72157	72158	72158	I	0	" Is she not well ? "
72161	72167	72168	72168	he	104	" She is perfectly well , "
72171	72181	72168	72168	he	104	" Why should you imagine her to be otherwise ? "
72182	72186	72187	72187	I	0	" Pardon me , "
72190	72202	72187	72187	I	0	" I fancied that you looked unhappy when I mentioned her . "
72226	72231	72232	72232	he	104	" Look out yonder . "
72240	72326	72232	72232	he	104	" look at the dark blue veil strewn with stars , through which so lately your daring soul pierced its flight ! See how the small Moon hangs like a lamp in Heaven , apparently outshining the myriad worlds around her , that are so much vaster and fairer ! How deceptive is the human eye ! - nearly as deceptive as the human reason . Tell me - why did you not visit the Moon , or the Sun , in your recent wanderings ? "
72414	72587	72404	72404	Heliobas	104	" You can not guess the reason of your omission ? I will tell you . There is nothing to see in either Sun or Moon . They were both inhabited worlds once ; but the dwellers in the Sun have ages ago lived their lives and passed to the Central Sphere . The Sun is nothing now but a burning world , burning rapidly , and surely , away : or rather , IT IS BEING ABSORBED BACK INTO THE ELECTRIC CIRCLE FROM WHICH IT ORIGINALLY SPRANG , TO BE THROWN OUT AGAIN IN SOME NEW AND GRANDER FORM . And so with all worlds , suns and systems , for ever and ever . Hundreds of thousands of those brief time - breathings called years may pass before this consummation of the Sun ; but its destruction is going on now , or rather its absorption - and we on our cold small star warm ourselves , and are glad , in the light of an empty world on fire ! "
72595	72600	72601	72601	I	0	" And the Moon ? "
72605	72660	72404	72404	Heliobas	104	" The Moon does not exist . What we see is the reflection or the electrograph of what she once was . Atmospherical electricity has imprinted this picture of a long - ago living world upon the heavens , just as Raphael drew his cartoons for the men of to - day to see . "
72661	72664	72665	72665	I	0	" But , "
72670	72686	72665	72665	I	0	" how about the Moon 's influence on the tides ? and what of eclipses ? "
72687	72900	72404	72404	Heliobas	104	" Not the Moon , but the electric photograph of a once living but now absorbed world , has certainly an influence on the tides . The sea is impregnated with electricity . Just as the Sun will absorb colours , so the electricity in the sea is repelled or attracted by the electric picture of the Moon in Heaven . Because , as a painting is full of colour , so is that faithful sketch of a vanished sphere , drawn with a pencil of pure light , full of immense electricity ; and to carry the simile further , just as a painting may be said to be formed of various dark and light tints , so the electric portrait of the Moon contains various degrees of electric force - which , coming in contact with the electricity of the Earth 's atmosphere , produces different effects on us and on the natural scenes amid which we dwell . As for eclipses - if you slowly pass a round screen between yourself and a blazing fire , you will only see the edges of the fire . In the same way the electrograph of the Moon passes at stated intervals between the Earth and the burning world of the Sun . "
72901	72905	72906	72906	I	0	" Yet surely , "
72909	72950	72906	72906	I	0	" the telescope has enabled us to see the Moon as a solid globe - we have discerned mountains and valleys on its surface ; and then it revolves round us regularly - how do you account for these facts ? "
72951	72955	72957	72957	Heliobas	104	" The telescope , "
72959	73300	72957	72957	Heliobas	104	" is merely an aid to the human eye ; and , as I told you before , nothing is so easily deceived as our sense of vision , even when assisted by mechanical appliances . The telescope , like the stereoscope , simply enables us to see the portrait of the Moon more clearly ; but all the same , the Moon , as a world , does not exist . Her likeness , taken by electricity , may last some thousands of years , and as long as it lasts it must revolve around us , because everything in the universe moves , and moves in a circle . Besides which , this portrait of the moon being composed of pure electricity , is attracted and forced to follow the Earth by the compelling influence of the Earth 's own electric power . Therefore , till the picture fades , it must attend the Earth like the haunting spectre of a dead joy . You can understand now why we never see what we imagine to be the OTHER SIDE of the Moon . It simply has NO other side , except space . Space is the canvas - the Moon is a sketch . How interested we are when a discovery is made of some rare old painting , of which the subject is a perfectly beautiful woman ! It bears no name - perhaps no date - but the face that smiles at us is exquisite - the lips yet pout for kisses - the eyes brim over , with love ! And we admire it tenderly and reverently - we mark it ' Portrait of a lady , ' and give it an honoured place among our art collections . With how much more reverence and tenderness ought we to look up at the ' Portrait of a Fair Lost Sphere , ' circling yonder in that dense ever - moving gallery of wonders where the hurrying throng of spectators are living and dying worlds ! "
73317	73327	73314	73314	I	0	" Dying , Heliobas ? There is no death . "
73328	73331	73332	73332	he	432	" True ! "
73339	73357	73332	73332	he	432	" But there is what we call death - transition - and it is always a parting . "
73358	73364	73365	73365	I	0	" But not for long ! "
73380	73460	73365	73365	I	0	" As worlds are absorbed into the Electric Circle and again thrown out in new and more glorious forms , so are we absorbed and changed into shapes of perfect beauty , having eyes that are strong and pure enough to look God in the face . The body perishes - but what have WE to do with the body - our prison and place of experience , except to rejoice when we shake off its weight for ever ! "
73465	73474	73475	73475	he	432	" You have learned your high lesson well , "
73478	73534	73535	73535	he	432	" You speak with the assurance and delight of a spirit satisfied . But when I talk of DEATH , I mean by that word the parting asunder of two souls who love each other ; and though such separation may be brief , still it is always a separation . For instance , suppose - "
73545	73545	73535	73535	he	432	"
73546	73556	73557	73557	I	0	" Well , you would soon meet her again , "
73560	73589	73557	73557	I	0	" For though you might live many years after her , still you would know in yourself that those years were but minutes in the realms of space - "
73590	73597	73598	73598	he	432	" Minutes that decide our destinies , "
73603	73683	73598	73598	he	432	" And there is always this possibility to contemplate - suppose Zara were to leave me now , how can I be sure that I shall be strong enough to live out my remainder of life purely enough to deserve to meet her again ? And if not then Zara 's death would mean utter and almost hopeless separation for ever - though perhaps I might begin over again in some other form , and so reach the goal . "
73711	73718	73719	73719	I	0	" You are melancholy , Heliobas , "
73722	73810	73719	73719	I	0	" In the first place , Zara is not going to leave you yet ; and secondly , if she did , you know your strongest efforts would be brought to bear on your career , in order that no shadow of obstinacy or error might obstruct your path . Why , the very essence of our belief is in the strength of Will - power . What we WILL to do , especially if it be any act of spiritual progress , we can always accomplish . "
73820	73831	73832	73832	he	104	" You are so lately come from the high regions , "
73835	73951	73832	73832	he	104	" that it warms and invigorates me to hear your encouraging words . Pray do not think me capable of yielding long to the weakness of foreboding . I am , in spite of my advancement in electric science , nothing but a man , and am apt to be hampered oftentimes by my mortal trappings . We have prolonged our conversation further than I intended . I assure you it is better for you to try to sleep , even though , as I know , you feel so wide awake . Let me give you a soothing draught ; it will have the effect of composing your physical nerves into steady working order . "
73982	73990	73991	73991	I	0	" Good - night , my Master ! "
73995	74089	73991	73991	I	0	" You need have no fear of your own successful upward progress . For if there were the slightest chance of your falling into fatal error , all those human souls you have benefited would labour and pray for your rescue ; and I know now that prayers reach Heaven , so long as they are unselfish . I , though I am one of the least of your disciples , out of the deep gratitude of my heart towards you , will therefore pray unceasingly for you , both here and hereafter . "
74095	74100	74101	74101	he	1127	" I thank you ! "
74105	74135	74101	74101	he	1127	" More deeds are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of ! That is a true saying . God bless you , my child . Good - night ! "

74929	74969	74920	74920	She	152	" I have been talking for more than an hour with Casimir . He has told me everything . What wonders you have seen ! And are you not happy , dearest ? Are you not strong and satisfied ? "
74970	74973	74974	74974	I	0	" Perfectly ! "
74977	74997	74974	74974	I	0	" But , O Zara ! what a pity that all the world should not know what we know ! "
74998	75007	75009	75009	Zara	152	" All have not a desire for knowledge , "
75011	75052	75009	75009	Zara	152	" Even in your vision of the garden you possessed , there were only a few who still sought you ; for those few you would have done anything , but for the others your best efforts were in vain . "
75053	75063	75064	75064	I	0	" They might not have been always in vain , "
75068	75075	75077	75077	Zara	152	" No , they might not , "
75079	75162	75077	75077	Zara	152	" That is just the case of the world to - day . While there is life in it , there is also hope . And talking of the world , let me remind you that you are back in it now , and must therefore be hampered with tiresome trivialities . Two of these are as follows ; First , here is a letter for you , which has just come ; secondly , breakfast will be ready in twenty minutes ! "
75232	75246	75247	75247	I	0	" I will be down punctually at the expiration of the twenty minutes , "
75250	75291	75247	75247	I	0	" I assure you , Zara , I am quite sensible of the claims of earthly existence upon me . For instance , I am very hungry , and I shall enjoy breakfast immensely if you will make the coffee . "

75400	75492	75397	75397	her	152	" we shall have landed at the Grand Hotel . Come and see us at once , if you can . The Colonel is anxious to judge for himself how you are looking . If you are really recovered sufficiently to leave your medical pension , we shall be delighted to have you with us again . I , in particular , shall be glad , for it is real lonesome when the Colonel is out , and I do hate to go shopping by myself , So take pity upon your affectionate

75523	75534	75535	75535	I	0	" I wish you would come with me , Zara , "
75546	75577	75543	75543	she	152	" Certainly I will , if you like . But we will attend High Mass at Notre Dame first . There will be plenty of time for the call afterwards . "
75591	75665	75585	75585	Heliobas	104	" Why not ask your friends to dine here to - morrow ? Zara 's call will be a sufficient opening formality ; and you yourself have been long enough with us now to know that any of your friends will be welcome here . We might have a pleasant little party , especially if you add Mr. and Mrs. Challoner and their daughters to the list . And I will ask Ivan . "
75689	75695	75696	75696	I	0	" You are very hospitable , "
75702	75731	75696	75696	I	0	" but I really see no reason why you should throw open your doors to my friends , unless , indeed , you specially desire to please me . "
75732	75740	75741	75741	he	104	" Why , of course I do ! "

75759	75785	75756	75756	I	0	" I will ask them to come . What am I to say about my recovery , which I know is little short of miraculous ? "
75786	75789	75791	75791	Heliobas	104	" Say , "
75793	75844	75791	75791	Heliobas	104	" that you have been cured by electricity . There is nothing surprising in such a statement nowadays . But say nothing of the HUMAN electric force employed upon you - no one would believe you , and the effort to persuade unpersuadable people is always a waste of time . "
76081	76086	76099	76099	Zara	152	" Sanctus ! Sanctus ! "

76258	76333	76255	76255	she	152	" you are simply in lovely condition ! I never would have believed it . You are actually as plump and pink as a peach . And you are the same creature that wailed and trembled , and had palpitations and headaches and stupors ! Your doctor must be a perfect magician . I think I must consult him , for I am sure I do n't look half as well as you do . "
76404	76428	76401	76401	I	0	" Amy , you must allow me to introduce the sister of my doctor to you . Madame Zara Casimir - Mrs. Everard . "

76510	76529	76480	76480	she	152	" has also become mine ; but I do not think we shall be jealous , shall we ? "
76613	76619	76610	76610	he	1857	" taken off his feet , "
76704	76713	76734	76734	she	159	" doocid pretty , with go in her , "
77004	77043	76988	76988	Zara	152	" Indeed , I think it will be better for her to remain perfectly quiet with us for a day or two longer ; then she will be thoroughly cured , and free to do as she likes . "
77044	77047	77049	77050	Mrs. Challoner	156	" Well ! "
77052	77099	77049	77050	Mrs. Challoner	156	" I must say she does n't look as if anything were the matter with her . In fact , I never saw two more happy , healthy - looking girls than you both . What secret do you possess to make yourselves look so bright ? "
77100	77106	77108	77108	Zara	152	" No secret at all , "
77112	77126	77108	77108	Zara	152	" we simply follow the exact laws of health , and they suffice . "
77150	77170	77127	77128	Colonel Everard	92	" Do you really mean to say , Madame Casimir , that your brother cured this girl by electricity ? "
77171	77175	77176	77176	she	152	" Purely so ! "
77180	77244	77127	77128	Colonel Everard	92	" Then it 's the most wonderful recovery I ever saw . Why , at Cannes , she was hollow - eyed , pale , and thin as a willow - wand ; now she looks - well , she knows how she is herself - but if she feels as spry as she looks , she 's in first - rate training ! "
77248	77256	77257	77257	I	0	" I DO feel spry , Colonel , "
77260	77269	77257	77257	I	0	" Life seems to me like summer sunshine . "
77270	77273	77275	77276	Mr. Challoner	199	" Brava ! "
77303	77381	77292	77292	he	199	" If there 's one class of folk I detest more than another , it is those all - possessed people who find life unsuited to their fancies . Nobody asked them to come into it - nobody would miss them if they went out of it . Being in it , it 's barely civil to grumble at the Deity who sent them along here . I never do it myself if I can help it . "
77392	77401	77402	77402	she	156	" In England , dear , for instance , "
77413	77423	77402	77402	she	156	" in England you never grumbled , did you ? "
77443	77450	77451	77451	he	199	" Why , by the Lord ! "
77463	77491	77492	77492	he	199	" in England the liveliest flea that ever gave a triumphal jump in air would find his spirits inclined to droop ! I tell you , ma'am , "
77517	77579	77496	77496	himself	199	" I tell you that when I walked in the streets of London I used to feel as if I were one of a band of criminals . Every person I met looked at me as if the universe were about to be destroyed next minute , and they had to build another up right away without God to help 'em ! "
77580	77590	77592	77593	Colonel Everard	92	" Well , I believe I agree with you , "
77595	77636	77592	77593	Colonel Everard	92	" The English take life too seriously . In their craze for business they manage to do away with pleasure altogether . They seem afraid to laugh , and they even approach the semblance of a smile with due caution . "
77637	77644	77646	77647	his wife	322	" I 'm free to confess , "
77649	77681	77646	77647	his wife	322	" that I 'm not easily chilled through . But an English ' at home ' acts upon me like a patent refrigerator - I get regularly frozen to the bone ! "
77682	77686	77688	77688	Zara	152	" Dear me ! "
77690	77707	77688	77688	Zara	152	" you give very bad accounts of Shakespeare 's land ! It must be very sad ! "
77708	77717	77719	77720	Colonel Everard	92	" I believe it was n't always so , "
77722	77790	77719	77720	Colonel Everard	92	" there are legends which speak of it as Merrie England . I dare say it might have been merry once , before it was governed by shopkeepers ; but now , you must get away from it if you want to enjoy life . At least such is my opinion . But have you never been in England , Madame Casimir ? You speak English perfectly . "
77791	77801	77803	77803	Zara	152	" Oh , I am a fairly good linguist , "
77805	77819	77803	77803	Zara	152	" thanks to my brother . But I have never crossed the Channel . "
77839	77847	77848	77848	he	1175	" Do n't cross it , ma'am , "
77852	77889	77848	77848	he	1175	" unless you have a special desire to be miserable . If you want to know how Christians love one another and how to be made limply and uselessly wretched , spend a Sunday in London . "
77890	77903	77905	77905	Zara	152	" I think I will not try the experiment , Mr. Challoner , "
77908	77920	77905	77905	Zara	152	" Life is short , and I prefer to enjoy it . "
77921	77924	77926	77927	Mrs. Challoner	156	" Say , "
77936	77961	77926	77927	Mrs. Challoner	156	" now you are feeling so well , would it be asking you too much to play us a piece of your own improvising ? "
78137	78174	78132	78133	Heinrich Heine	202	" Lady , did you not hear the nightingale sing ? A beautiful silken voice - a web of happy notes - and my soul was taken in its meshes , and strangled and tortured thereby . "
78257	78264	78266	78267	Mrs. Challoner	156	" How can you do it ? "
78274	78296	78266	78267	Mrs. Challoner	156	" It seems to me impossible to compose like that while seated at the piano , and without taking previous thought ! "
78297	78304	78305	78305	I	0	" It is not MY doing , "
78308	78317	78305	78305	I	0	" it seems to come to me from - "

78506	78703	78503	78503	she	152	" yet I have had two or three masters who were supposed to be first - rate . One of them was a German , who used to clutch his hair like a walking tragedian whenever I played a wrong note . I believe he got up his reputation entirely by that clutch , for he often played wrong notes himself without minding it . But just because he worked himself into a sort of frenzy when others went wrong , everybody praised him , and said he had such an ear and was so sensitive that he must be a great musician . He worried me nearly to death over Bach 's ' Well - tempered Klavier ' - all to no purpose , for I ca n't play a note of it now , and should n't care to if I could . I consider Bach a dreadful old bore , though I know it is heresy to say so . Even Beethoven is occasionally prosy , only no one will be courageous enough to admit it . People would rather go to sleep over classical music than confess they do n't like it . "

The Prince generously permits it to remain on view for a few days longer , so that those who have not yet enjoyed its attraction , have still time to behold one of the most wonderful pictures of the age . The colouring yet remains a marvel to both students and connoisseurs , and the life - like appearance of the girl 's figure , robed in its clinging white draperies ornamented with lilies of the valley , is so strong , that one imagines she will step out of the canvas and confront the bystanders . Signor Cellini must now be undoubtedly acknowledged as one of the greatest geniuses of modern times . "
79960	79967	79968	79968	I	0	" The Electric Principle of Christianity , "
80404	80409	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Electric Principle of Christianity "
80414	80469	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" From all Eternity God , or the SUPREME SPIRIT OF LIGHT , existed , and to all Eternity He will continue to exist . This is plainly stated in the New Testament thus : ' God is a SPIRIT , and they that worship Him must worship Him IN SPIRIT and in truth . '
80470	80518	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" He is a Shape of pure Electric Radiance . Those who may be inclined to doubt this may search the Scriptures on which they pin their faith , and they will find that all the visions and appearances of the Deity there chronicled were electric in character .
80519	80629	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" As a poet forms poems , or a musician melodies , so God formed by a Thought the Vast Central Sphere in which He dwells , and peopled it with the pure creations of His glorious fancy . And why ? Because , being pure Light , He is also pure Love ; the power or capacity of Love implies the necessity of Loving ; the necessity of loving points to the existence of things to be loved - hence the secret of creation . From the ever - working Intelligence of this Divine Love proceeded the Electric Circle of the Universe , from whence are born all worlds .
80630	80682	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" This truth vaguely dawned upon the ancient poets of Scripture when they wrote : ' Darkness was upon the face of the deep . And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters . And God said , Let there be light . And there was light . '
80683	80754	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" These words apply SOLELY to the creation or production of OUR OWN EARTH , and in them we read nothing but a simple manifestation of electricity , consisting in a HEATING PASSAGE OF RAYS from the Central Circle to the planet newly propelled forth from it , which caused that planet to produce and multiply the wonders of the animal , vegetable , and mineral kingdoms which we call Nature .
80755	80934	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Let us now turn again to the poet - prophets of Scripture : ' And God said , Let us make man in our image . ' The word ' OUR ' here implies an instinctive idea that God was never alone . This idea is correct . Love can not exist in a chaos ; and God by the sheer necessity of His Being has for ever been surrounded by radiant and immortal Spirits emanating from His own creative glory - beings in whom all beauty and all purity are found . In the IMAGES , therefore only the IMAGES , of these Children of Light and of Himself , He made Man - that is , He caused the Earth to be inhabited and DOMINATED by beings composed of Earth 's component parts , animal , vegetable , and mineral , giving them their superiority by placing within them His ' LIKENESS ' in the form of an ELECTRIC FLAME or GERM of spiritual existence combined with its companion working - force of WILL - POWER .
80935	81127	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Like all flames , this electric spark can either be fanned into a fire or it can be allowed to escape in air - IT CAN NEVER BE DESTROYED . It can be fostered and educated till it becomes a living Spiritual Form of absolute beauty - an immortal creature of thought , memory , emotion , and working intelligence . If , on the contrary , he is neglected or forgotten , and its companion Will is drawn by the weight of Earth to work for earthly aims alone , then it escapes and seeks other chances of development in OTHER FORMS on OTHER PLANETS , while the body it leaves , SUPPORTED ONLY BY PHYSICAL SUSTENANCE DRAWN FROM THE EARTH ON WHICH IT DWELLS , becomes a mere lump of clay ANIMATED BY MERE ANIMAL LIFE SOLELY , full of inward ignorance and corruption and outward incapacity . Of such material are the majority of men composed BY THEIR OWN FREE - WILL AND CHOICE , because they habitually deaden the voice of conscience and refuse to believe in the existence of a spiritual element within and around them .
81128	81305	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" To resume : the Earth is one of the smallest of planets ; and not only this , but , from its position in the Universe , receives a less amount of direct influence from the Electric Circle than other worlds more happily situated . Were men wise enough to accept this fact , they would foster to the utmost the germs of electric sympathy within themselves , in order to form a direct communication , or system of attraction , between this planet and the ever - widening Ring , so that some spiritual benefit might accrue to them thereby . But as the ages roll on , their chances of doing this diminish . The time is swiftly approaching when the invincible Law of Absorption shall extinguish Earth as easily as we blow out the flame of a candle . True , it may be again reproduced , and again thrown out on space ; but then it will be in a new and grander form , and will doubtless have more godlike inhabitants .
81306	81408	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" In the meantime - during those brief cycles of centuries which are as a breath in the workings of the Infinite , and which must yet elapse before this world , as we know it , comes to an end - God has taken pity on the few , very few souls dwelling here , pent up in mortal clay , who have blindly tried to reach Him , like plants straining up to the light , and has established a broad stream of sympathetic electric communication with Himself , which all who care to do so may avail themselves of .
81409	81521	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Here it may be asked : Why should God take pity ? Because that Supreme Shape of Light finds a portion of Himself in all pure souls that love Him , and HE CANNOT DESPISE HIMSELF . Also because He is capable of all the highest emotions known to man , in a far larger and grander degree , besides possessing other sentiments and desires unimaginable to the human mind . It is enough to say that all the attributes that accompany perfect goodness He enjoys ; therefore He can feel compassion , tenderness , forgiveness , patience - all or any of the emotions that produce pure , unselfish pleasure .
81522	81705	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Granting Him , therefore , these attributes and it is both blasphemous and unreasonable to DENY HIM THOSE VIRTUES WHICH DISTINGUISH THE BEST OF MEN , it is easily understood how He , the All - Fair Beneficent Ruler of the Central Sphere , perceiving the long distance to which the Earth was propelled , like a ball flung too far out , from the glory of His Electric Ring , saw also that the creatures He had made in His image were in danger of crushing that image completely out , and with it all remembrance of Him , in the fatal attention they gave to their merely earthly surroundings , lacking , as they did , and not possessing sufficient energy to seek , electric attraction . In brief , this Earth and God 's World were like America and Europe before the Atlantic Cable was laid . Now the messages of goodwill flash under the waves , heedless of the storms . So also God 's Cable is laid between us and His Heaven in the person of Christ .
81706	81859	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" For ages always remembering that our ages are with God a moment the idea of WORSHIP was in the mind of man . With this idea came also the sentiment of PROPITIATION . The untamed savage has from time immemorial instinctively felt the necessity of looking up to a Being greater than Himself , and also of seeking a reconciliation with that Being for some fault or loss in himself which he is aware of , yet can not explain . This double instinct - worship and propitiation - is the key - note of all the creeds of the world , and may be called God 's first thought of the cable to be hereafter laid - a lightning - thought which He instilled into the human race to prepare it , as one might test a telegraph - wire from house to house , before stretching it across a continent .
81860	82070	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" All religions , as known to us , are mere types of Christianity . It is a notable fact that some of the oldest and most learned races in the world , such as the Armenians and Chaldeans , were the first to be convinced of the truth of Christ 's visitation . Buddhism , of which there are so many million followers , is itself a type of Christ 's teaching ; only it lacks the supernatural element . Buddha died a hermit at the age of eighty , as any wise and ascetic man might do to - day . The death and resurrection of Christ were widely different . Anyone can be a Buddha again ; anyone can NOT be a Christ . That there are stated to be more followers of Buddhism than of Christianity is no proof of any efficacy in the former or lack of power in the latter . Buddhists help to swell that very large class of persons who prefer a flattering picture to a plain original ; or who , sheep - like by nature , finding themselves all together in one meadow , are too lazy , as well as too indifferent , to seek pastures fresher and fairer .
82071	82158	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Through the divine influence of an Electric Thought , then , the world unconsciously grew to expect SOMETHING - they knew not what . The old creeds of the world , like sunflowers , turned towards that unknown Sun ; the poets , prophets , seers , all spoke of some approaching consolation and glory ; and to this day the fated Jews expect it , unwilling to receive as their Messiah the Divine Martyr they slew , though their own Scriptures testify to His identity .
82159	82299	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Christ came , born of a Virgin ; that is , a radiant angel from God 's Sphere was in the first place sent down to Earth to wear the form of Mary of Bethlehem , in Judea . Within that vessel of absolute purity God placed an Emanation of His own radiance - no germ or small flame such as is given to us in our bodies to cultivate and foster , but a complete immortal Spirit , a portion of God Himself , wise , sinless , and strong . This Spirit , pent up in clay , was born as a helpless babe , grew up as man - as man taught , comforted , was slain and buried ; but as pure Spirit rose again and returned in peace to Heaven , His mission done .
82300	82616	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" It was necessary , in order to establish what has been called an electric communication between God 's Sphere and this Earth , that an actual immortal , untainted Spirit in the person of Christ should walk this world , sharing with men sufferings , difficulties , danger , and death . Why ? In order that we might first completely confide in and trust Him , afterwards realizing His spiritual strength and glory by His resurrection . And here may be noted the main difference between the Electric Theory of Christianity and other theories . CHRIST DID NOT DIE BECAUSE GOD NEEDED A SACRIFICE . The idea of sacrifice is a relic of heathen barbarism ; God is too infinitely loving to desire the sacrifice of the smallest flower . He is too patient to be ever wrathful ; and barbaric ignorance confronts us again in the notion that He should need to be appeased . And the fancy that He should desire Himself or part of Himself to become a sacrifice to Himself has arisen out of the absurd and conflicting opinions of erring humanity , wherein right and wrong are so jumbled together that it is difficult to distinguish one from the other . Christ 's death was not a sacrifice ; it was simply a means of confidence and communion with the Creator . A sinless Spirit suffered to show us how to suffer ; lived on earth to show us how to live ; prayed to show us how to pray ; died to show us how to die ; rose again to impress strongly upon us that there was in truth a life beyond this one , for which He strove to prepare our souls . Finally , by His re - ascension into Heaven He established that much - needed electric communication between us and the Central Sphere .
82617	82675	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" It can be proved from the statements of the New Testament that in Christ was an Embodied Electric Spirit . From first to last His career was attended by ELECTRIC PHENOMENA , of which eight examples are here quoted ; and earnest students of the matter can find many others if they choose to examine for themselves .
82676	82859	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" 1 . The appearance of the Star and the Vision of Angels on the night of His birth . The Chaldeans saw His ' star in the east , ' and they came to worship Him . The Chaldeans were always a learned people , and electricity was an advanced science with them . They at once recognized the star to be no new planet , but simply a star - shaped flame flitting through space . They knew what this meant . Observe , too , that they had no doubts upon the point ; they came ' to worship him , ' and provided themselves with gifts to offer to this radiant Guest , the offspring of pure Light . The vision of the angels appearing to the shepherds was simply a joyous band of the Singing Children of the Electric Ring , who out of pure interest and pleasure floated in sight of Earth , drawn thither partly by the already strong attractive influence of the Radiance that was imprisoned there in the form of the Babe of Bethlehem .
82860	82877	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" 2 . When Christ was baptized by John the Baptist , ' THE HEAVENS OPENED . '
82878	82928	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" 3 . The sympathetic influence of Christ was so powerful that when He selected His disciples , He had but to speak to them , and at the sound of His voice , though they were engaged in other business , ' THEY LEFT ALL AND FOLLOWED HIM . "
82929	83063	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" 4 . Christ 's body was charged with electricity . Thus He was easily able to heal sick and diseased persons by a touch or a look . The woman who caught at His garment in the crowd was cured of her long - standing ailment ; and we see that Christ was aware of His own electric force by the words He used on that occasion : ' WHO TOUCHED ME ? FOR I FEEL THAT SOME VIRTUE IS GONE OUT OF ME ' - which is the exact feeling that a physical electrician experiences at this day after employing his powers on a subject . The raising of Jairus 's daughter , of the widow 's son at Nain , and of Lazarus , were all accomplished by the same means .
83064	83161	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" 5 . The walking on the sea was a purely electric effort , AND CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED NOW BY ANYONE who has cultivated sufficient inner force . The sea being full of electric particles will support anybody sufficiently and similarly charged - the two currents combining to procure the necessary equilibrium . Peter , who was able to walk a little way , lost his power directly his will became vanquished by fear - because the sentiment of fear disperses electricity , and being purely HUMAN emotion , does away with spiritual strength for the time .
83162	83200	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" 6 . The Death of Christ was attended by electric manifestations - by the darkness over the land during the Crucifixion ; the tearing of the temple veil in twain ; and the earthquake which finally ensued .
83201	83348	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" 7 . The Resurrection was a most powerful display of electric force . It will be remembered that the angel who was found sitting at the entrance of the empty sepulchre ' had a countenance like LIGHTNING , ' i.e. , like electric flame . It must also be called to mind how the risen Christ addressed Mary Magdalene : ' TOUCH ME NOT , for I am but newly risen ! ' Why should she not have touched Him ? Simply because His strength then was the strength of concentrated in - rushing currents of electricity ; and to touch him at that moment would have been for Magdalene instant death by lightning . This effect of embodied electric force has been shadowed forth in the Greek legends of Apollo , whose glory consumed at a breath the mortal who dared to look upon him .
83349	83448	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" 8 . The descent of the Holy Ghost , by which term is meant an ever - flowing current of the inspired working Intelligence of the Creator , was purely electric in character : ' Suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting . And there appeared unto them CLOVEN TONGUES LIKE AS OF FIRE , and sat upon each of them . ' It may here be noted that the natural electric flame is DUAL or ' cloven ' in shape .
83449	83537	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Let us now take the Creed as accepted to - day by the Christian Church , and see how thoroughly it harmonizes with the discoveries of spiritual electricity . ' I believe in one God the Father Almighty , Maker of Heaven and Earth , and of all things VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE . ' This is a brief and simple description of the Creator as He exists - a Supreme Centre of Light , out of whom MUST spring all life , all love , all wisdom .
83538	83782	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" ' And in one Lord Jesus Christ , the only begotten Son of God , born of the Father before all ages . ' This means that the only absolute Emanation of His own PERSONAL Radiance that ever wore such mean garb as our clay was found in Christ - who , as part of God , certainly existed ' BEFORE ALL AGES . ' For as the Creed itself says , He was ' God of God , LIGHT OF LIGHT . Then we go on through the circumstances of Christ 's birth , life , death , and resurrection , and our profession of faith brings us to ' I believe in the Holy Ghost , the Lord and Giver of Life , who proceedeth from the Father and the Son , ' etc . This , as already stated , means that we believe that since Christ ascended into Heaven , our electric communication with the Creator has been established , and an ever - flowing current of divine inspiration is turned beneficially in the direction of our Earth , ' proceeding from the Father and the Son . ' We admit in the Creed that this inspiration manifested itself before Christ came and ' SPAKE BY THE PROPHETS ; ' but , as before stated , this only happened at rare and difficult intervals , while now Christ Himself speaks through those who most strongly adhere to His teachings .
83783	84242	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" It may here be mentioned that few seem to grasp the fact of the SPECIAL MESSAGE TO WOMEN intended to be conveyed in the person of the Virgin Mary . She was actually one of the radiant Spirits of the Central Sphere , imprisoned by God 's will in woman 's form . After the birth of Christ , she was still kept on earth , to follow His career to the end . There was a secret understanding between Himself and her . As for instance , when she found Him among the doctors of the law , she for one moment suffered her humanity to get the better of her in anxious inquiries ; and His reply , ' Why sought ye Me ? Wist ye not that I must be about My Father 's business ? ' was a sort of reminder to her , which she at once accepted . Again , at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee , when Christ turned the water into wine , He said to His mother , ' WOMAN , what have I to do with thee ? ' which meant simply : What have I to do with thee as WOMAN merely ? - which was another reminder to her of her spiritual origin , causing her at once to address the servants who stood by as follows : ' Whatsoever He saith unto you , do it . ' And why , it may be asked , if Mary was really an imprisoned immortal Spirit , sinless and joyous , should she be forced to suffer all the weaknesses , sorrows , and anxieties of any ordinary woman and mother ? SIMPLY AS AN EXAMPLE TO WOMEN who are the mothers of the human race ; and who , being thus laid under a heavy responsibility , need sympathetic guidance . Mary 's life teaches women that the virtues they need are - obedience , purity , meekness , patience , long - suffering , modesty , self - denial , and endurance . She loved to hold a secondary position ; she placed herself in willing subjection to Joseph - a man of austere and simple life , advanced in years , and weighted with the cares of a family by a previous marriage - who wedded her by AN INFLUENCE WHICH COMPELLED HIM to become her protector in the eyes of the world . Out of these facts , simple as they are , can be drawn the secret of happiness for women - a secret and a lesson that , if learned by heart , would bring them and those they love out of storm and bewilderment into peace and safety .
84243	84339	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ONCE BECOME AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE CENTRAL SPHERE AND OF THE ELECTRIC RING SURROUNDING IT , AND WHO ARE ABLE TO REALISE TO THE FULL THE GIGANTIC AS WELL AS MINUTE WORK PERFORMED BY THE ELECTRIC WAVES AROUND US AND WITHIN US , there can no longer be any doubt as to all the facts of Christianity , as none of them , VIEWED BY THE ELECTRIC THEORY , are otherwise than in accordance with the Creator 's love and sympathy with even the smallest portion of His creation .
84340	84569	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Why then , if Christianity be a Divine Truth , are not all people Christians ? As well ask , if music and poetry are good things , why all men are not poets and musicians . Art seeks art ; in like manner God seeks God - that is , He seeks portions of His own essence among His creatures . Christ Himself said , ' Many are called , but few are chosen ; ' and it stands to reason that very few souls will succeed in becoming pure enough to enter the Central Sphere without hindrance . Many , on leaving Earth , will be detained in the Purgatory of Air , where thousands of spirits work for ages , watching over others , helping and warning others , and in this unselfish labour succeed in raising themselves , little by little , higher and ever higher , till they at last reach the longed - for goal . It must also be remembered that not only from Earth , but from ALL WORLDS , released souls seek to attain final happiness in the Central Sphere where God is ; so that , however great the number of those that are permitted to proceed thither from this little planet , they can only form , as it were , one drop in a mighty ocean .
84570	84966	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" It has been asked whether the Electric Theory of Christianity includes the doctrine of Hell , or a place of perpetual punishment . Eternal Punishment is merely a form of speech for what is really Eternal Retrogression . For as there is a Forward , so there must be a Backward . The electric germ of the Soul - delicate , fiery , and imperishable as it is - can be forced by its companion Will to take refuge in a lower form of material existence , dependent on the body it first inhabits . For instance , a man who is obstinate in pursuing ACTIVE EVIL can so retrograde the progress of any spiritual life within him , that it shall lack the power to escape , as it might do , from merely lymphatic and listless temperaments , to seek some other chance of development , but shall sink into the form of quadrupeds , birds , and other creatures dominated by purely physical needs . But there is one thing it can never escape from - MEMORY . And in that faculty is constituted Hell . So that if a man , by choice , forces his soul DOWNWARD to inhabit hereafter the bodies of dogs , horses , and other like animals , he should know that he does so at the cost of everything except Remembrance . Eternal Retrogression means that the hopelessly tainted electric germ recoils further and further from the Pure Centre whence it sprang , ALWAYS BEARING WITHIN ITSELF the knowledge of WHAT IT WAS ONCE and WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN . There is a pathetic meaning in the eyes of a dog or a seal ; in the melancholy , patient gaze of the oxen toiling at the plough ; there is an unuttered warning in the silent faces of flowers ; there is more tenderness of regret in the voice of the nightingale than love ; and in the wild upward soaring of the lark , with its throat full of passionate , shouting prayer , there is shadowed forth the yearning hope that dies away in despair as the bird sinks to earth again , his instincts not half satisfied . There is no greater torture than to be compelled to remember , in suffering , joys and glorious opportunities gone for ever .
84967	85281	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Regarding the Electric Theory of Religion , it is curious to observe how the truth of it has again and again been dimly shadowed forth in the prophecies of Art , Science , and Poesy . The old painters who depicted a halo of light round the head of their Virgins and Saints did so out of a correct impulse which they did not hesitate to obey . Footnote : An impulse which led them vaguely to foresee , though , not to explain , the electric principle of spiritual life . The astronomers who , after years of profound study , have been enabled to measure the flames of the burning sun , and to find out that these are from two to four thousand miles high , are nearly arrived at the conclusion that it is a world in a state of conflagration , in which they will be perfectly right . Those who hold that this Earth of ours was once self - luminous are also right ; for it was indeed so when first projected from the Electric Ring . The compilers or inventors of the ' Arabian Nights ' also hit upon a truth when they described human beings as forced through evil influences to take the forms of lower animals - a truth just explained in the Law of Retrogression . All art , all prophecy , all poesy , should therefore be accepted eagerly and studied earnestly , for in them we find ELECTRIC INSPIRATION out of which we are able to draw lessons for our guidance hereafter . The great point that scientists and artists have hitherto failed to discover , is the existence of the Central Sphere and its Surrounding Electric Circle . Once realize these two great facts , and all the wonders and mysteries of the Universe are perfectly easy of comprehension .
85282	85601	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" In conclusion , I offer no opinion as to which is Christ 's Church , or the Fountain - head of spirituality in the world . In all Churches errors have intruded through unworthy and hypocritical members . In a crowded congregation of worshippers there may perhaps be only one or two who are free from self - interest and personal vanity . In Sectarianism , for instance , there is no shred of Christianity . Lovers of God and followers of Christ must , in the first place , have perfect Unity ; and the bond uniting them must be an electric one of love and faith . No true Christian should be able to hate , despise , or envy the other . Were I called upon to select among the churches , I should choose that which has most electricity working within it , and which is able to believe in a positive electrical communication between Christ and herself taking place daily on her altars - a Church which holds , as it were , the other end of the telegraphic ray between Earth and the Central Sphere , and which is , therefore , able to exist among the storms of modern opinions , affording refuge and consolation to the few determined travellers who are bound onward and upward . I shall not name the Church I mean , because it is the duty of everyone to examine and find it out for himself or herself . And even though this Church instinctively works in the right direction , it is full of errors introduced by ignorant and unworthy members - errors which must be carefully examined and cast aside by degrees . But , as I said before , it is the only Church which has Principles of Electricity within it , and is therefore destined to live , because electricity is life .
85602	85919	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Now I beseech the reader of this manuscript to which I , Heliobas , append my hand and seal , to remember and realize earnestly the following invincible facts : first that God and His Christ EXIST ; secondly , that while the little paltry affairs of our temporal state are being built up as crazily as a child 's house of cards , the huge Central Sphere revolves , and the Electric Ring , strong and indestructible , is ever at its work of production and re - absorption ; thirdly , that every thought and word of EVERY HABITANT ON EVERY PLANET is reflected in lightning language before the Creator 's eyes as easily as we receive telegrams ; fourthly , that this world is THE ONLY SPOT IN THE UNIVERSE where His existence is actually questioned and doubted . And the general spread of modern positivism , materialism and atheism is one of the most terrific and meaning signs of the times . The work of separating the wheat from the chaff is beginning . Those who love and believe in God and Spiritual Beauty are about to be placed on one side ; the millions who worship Self are drawing together in vast opposing ranks on the other ; and the moment approaches which is prophesied to be ' as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , and shineth even to the other part . ' In other words , the fiery whirlpool of the Ring is nearly ready to absorb our planet in its vortex ; and out of all who dwell upon its surface , how many shall reach the glorious Central World of God ? Of two men working in the same field , shall it not be as Christ foretold - ' the one shall be taken , and the other left ' ?
85920	86046	80388	80388	Heliobas	104	" Friend , or Pupil , Reader ! Whoever thou art , take heed and foster thine own soul ! For know that nothing can hinder the Immortal Germ within us from taking the form imposed upon it by our WILLS . Through Love and Faith , it can become an Angel , and perform wonders even while in its habitation of clay ; through indifference and apathy , it can desert us altogether and for ever ; through mockery and blasphemous disbelief , it can sink into even a lower form than that of snake or toad . In our own unfettered hand lies our eternal destiny . Wonderful and terrible responsibility ! Who shall dare to say we have no need of prayer ? "

86369	86403	86366	86366	I	0	" Why , of course , death sticks more closely to us than any friend or relative . But you look fitter to receive the embraces of life than of death , Zara . "
86404	86414	86415	86415	she	152	" They are both one and the same thing , "
86418	86450	86415	86415	she	152	" or rather , the one leads to the other . But do not let us begin to philosophize . Put on your things and come . The carriage is waiting . "

86618	86791	86612	86612	Heliobas	104	" They think emotion , passion , all true sentiment combined with extraordinary TECHNIQUE , must be ' clap - trap . ' Now the Continent of Europe acknowledges Pablo de Sarasate as the first violinist living , and London would not be London unless it could thrust an obtuse opposing opinion in the face of the Continent . England is the last country in the world to accept anything new . Its people are tired and blase ; like highly trained circus - horses , they want to trot or gallop always in the old grooves . It will always be so . Sarasate is like a brilliant meteor streaming across their narrow bit of the heaven of music ; they stare , gape , and think it is an unnatural phenomenon - a ' virtuosity ' in the way of meteors , which they are afraid to accept lest it set them on fire . What would you ? The meteor shines and burns ; it is always a meteor ! "

87894	87936	87938	87938	she	152	" You know I have been working secretly in my studio for some time past . I have been occupied in the execution of two designs - one is finished , and is intended as a gift to Casimir . The other "
87941	88037	87938	87938	she	152	" is incomplete . It is the colossal figure which was veiled when you first came in to see my little statue of ' Evening ' . I made an attempt beyond my powers - in short , I can not carry out the idea to my satisfaction . Now , dear , pay great attention to what I say . I have reason to believe that I shall be compelled to take a sudden journey - promise me that when I am gone you will see that unfinished statue completely destroyed - utterly demolished . "

88069	88108	88066	88066	I	0	" Well , if you are , I suppose you will soon return home again ; and why should your statue be destroyed in the meantime ? You may yet be able to bring it to final perfection . "

88148	88167	88168	88168	I	0	" I am not unwilling - believe me , dearest , I would do anything to please you , "
88172	88200	88168	88168	I	0	" but it seems so strange to me that you should wish the result of your labour destroyed , simply because you are going on a journey . "

91425	91433	91435	91436	Colonel Everard	92	" Is that your theory , sir ? "
91438	91446	91448	91448	Heliobas	104	" It is not only my theory , "
91450	91471	91448	91448	Heliobas	104	" it is a truth , indisputable and unalterable , to those who have studied the mysteries of electric science . "

91490	91527	91448	91448	Heliobas	104	" Certainly . Your young friend here , who came to me from Cannes , looking as if she had but a few months to live , can bear witness to the efficacy of my method . "

91558	91579	91555	91556	Mrs. Everard	93	" how you told me I looked like a sick nun at Cannes ? What do I look like now ? "
91580	91594	91595	91595	she	93	" You look as if you had never been ill in your life , "
91598	91605	91610	91610	his	199	" I was going to say , "
91614	91655	91610	91610	his	199	" that you remind me very much of a small painting of Diana that I saw in the Louvre the other day . You have the same sort of elasticity in your movements , and the same bright healthy eyes . "
91662	91680	91656	91656	I	0	" I did not know you were such a flatterer , Mr. Challoner ! Diana thanks you ! "
91702	91711	91713	91714	Colonel Everard	92	" What surprises me in that young man , "
91716	91762	91713	91714	Colonel Everard	92	" is his colouring . It is simply marvellous . He was amiable enough to present me with a little landscape scene ; and the effect of light upon it is so powerfully done that you would swear the sun was actually shining through it . "
91776	91791	91792	91792	he	104	" Mere trickery , my dear sir - a piece of clap - trap , "
91796	91896	91792	91792	he	104	" That is what would be said of such pictures - in England at least . And it WILL be said by many oracular , long - established newspapers , while Cellini lives . As soon as he is dead - ah ! c'est autre chose ! - he will then most probably be acknowledged the greatest master of the age . There may even be a Cellini ' School of Colouring , ' where a select company of daubers will profess to know the secret that has died with him . It is the way of the world ! "
91913	91920	91921	91921	he	199	" Right you are , sir ! "
91931	91981	91921	91921	he	199	" I drink to you ! Sir , I agree with you ! I calculate there 's a good many worlds flying round in space , but a more ridiculous , feeble - minded , contrary sort of world than this one , I defy any archangel to find ! "
91994	92262	91982	91982	Heliobas	104	" It is astonishing to me that people do not see to what an infinite number of uses they could put the little re - discovery they have made of LUMINOUS PAINT . In that simple thing there is a secret , which as yet they do not guess - a wonderful , beautiful , scientific secret , which may perhaps take them a few hundred years to find out . In the meantime they have got hold of one end of the thread ; they can make luminous paint , and with it they can paint light - houses , and , what is far more important - ships . Vessels in mid - ocean will have no more need of fog - signals and different - coloured lamps ; their own coat of paint will be sufficient to light them safely on their way . Even rooms can be so painted as to be perfectly luminous at night . A friend of mine , residing in Italy , has a luminous ballroom , where the ceiling is decorated with a moon and stars in electric light . The effect is exceedingly lovely ; and though people think a great deal of money must have been laid out upon it , it is perhaps the only great ballroom in Italy that has been really cheaply fitted up . But , as I said before , there is another secret behind the invention or discovery of luminous paint - a secret which , when once unveiled , will revolutionize all the schools of art in the world . "
92263	92270	92272	92273	Mrs. Challoner	156	" Do you know this secret ? "
92275	92282	91982	91982	Heliobas	104	" Yes , madame - perfectly . "
92283	92297	92299	92300	Erne Challoner	228	" Then why do n't you disclose it for the benefit of everybody ? "
92302	92339	91982	91982	Heliobas	104	" Because , my dear young lady , no one would believe me if I did . The time is not yet ripe for it . The world must wait till its people are better educated . "
92340	92344	92346	92347	Mrs. Everard	93	" Better educated ! "
92349	92372	92346	92347	Mrs. Everard	93	" Why , there is nothing talked of nowadays but education and progress ! The very children are wiser than their parents ! "
92373	92377	92379	92379	Heliobas	104	" The children ! "
92387	92747	92379	92379	Heliobas	104	" At the rate things are going , there will soon be no children left ; they will all be tired little old men and women before they are in their teens . The very babes will be born old . Many of them are being brought up without any faith in God or religion ; the result will be an increase of vice and crime . The purblind philosophers , miscalled wise men , who teach the children by the light of poor human reason only , and do away with faith in spiritual things , are bringing down upon the generations to come an unlooked - for and most terrific curse . Childhood , the happy , innocent , sweet , unthinking , almost angelic age , at which Nature would have us believe in fairies and all the delicate aerial fancies of poets , who are , after all , the only true sages - childhood , I say , is being gradually stamped out under the cruel iron heel of the Period - a period not of wisdom , health , or beauty , but one of drunken delirium , in which the world rushes feverishly along , its eyes fixed on one hard , glittering , stony - featured idol - Gold . Education ! Is it education to teach the young that their chances of happiness depend on being richer than their neighbours ? Yet that is what it all tends to . Get on ! - be successful ! Trample on others , but push forward yourself ! Money , money ! - let its chink be your music ; let its yellow shine be fairer than the eyes of love or friendship ! Let its piles accumulate and ever accumulate ! There are beggars in the streets , but they are impostors ! There is poverty in many places , but why seek to relieve it ? Why lessen the sparkling heaps of gold by so much as a coin ? Accumulate and ever accumulate ! Live so , and then - die ! And then - who knows what then ? "
92804	92813	92814	92814	he	199	" I 'm not a speaker , sir , "
92818	92951	92814	92814	he	199	" but I 've got a good deal of feeling somewheres ; and you 'll allow me to say that I feel your words - I think they 're right true . I 've often wanted to say what you 've said , but have n't seen my way clear to it . Anyhow , I 've had a very general impression about me that what we call Society has of late years been going , per express service , direct to the devil - if the ladies will excuse me for plain speaking . And as the journey is being taken by choice and free - will , I suppose there 's no hindrance or stoppage possible . Besides , it 's a downward line , and curiously free from obstructions . "
92952	92957	92959	92960	Mrs. Challoner	156	" Bravo , John ! "
92962	92978	92959	92960	Mrs. Challoner	156	" You are actually corning out ! I never heard you indulge in similes before . "
92979	92985	92987	92988	her husband	317	" Well , my dear , "
92993	93101	92987	92988	her husband	317	" better late than never . A simile is a good thing if it is n't overcrowded . For instance , Mr. Swinburne 's similes are laid on too thick sometimes . There is a verse of his , which , with all my admiration for him , I never could quite fathom . It is where he earnestly desires to be as ' Any leaf of any tree ; ' or , failing that , he would n't mind becoming ' As bones under the deep , sharp sea . ' I tried hard to see the point of that , but could n't fix it . "
93276	93284	93267	93267	she	152	" I have a toast to propose . "
93285	93290	93292	93293	the gentlemen	1304	" Hear , hear ! "

93429	93435	93436	93436	he	104	" She has forgotten ME ! "
93439	93444	93445	93445	I	0	" Never - never ! "
93449	93460	93445	93445	I	0	" Oh , Heliobas ! what is wrong with you ? "
93531	93534	93536	93537	Mr. Challoner	199	" Thunder , "
93540	93564	93536	93537	Mr. Challoner	199	" I thought we should have it . It has been unnaturally warm all day . A good storm will clear the air . "
93770	93792	93764	93764	she	152	" Play to us , dear ! Something soft and plaintive . We all delight in your music , you know . "
93793	93802	93803	93803	I	0	" Did you hear the thunder just now ? "
93807	93816	93818	93819	Mrs. Everard	152	" It WAS thunder ? I thought so ! "
93821	93844	93818	93819	Mrs. Everard	152	" Oh , I do hope there is not going to be a storm ! I am so afraid of a storm ! "
93845	93850	93852	93852	Zara	152	" You are nervous ? "
93875	93883	93885	93885	Amy	93	" Well , I suppose I am , "
93890	93929	93885	93885	Amy	93	" Yet I am plucky about most things , too . Still I do n't like to hear the elements quarrelling together - they are too much in earnest about it - and no person can pacify them . "
93972	94021	93965	93967	Edgar Allan Poe	231	" In Heaven a spirit doth dwell , Whose heart - strings are a lute ; None sing so wildly well As the angel Israfel , And the giddy stars , so legends tell , Ceasing their hymns , attend the spell Of his voice - all mute . "
94054	94064	94066	94067	Mrs. Everard	152	" Play - play , for goodness ' sake ! "
94069	94086	94066	94067	Mrs. Everard	152	" and then we shall not be obliged to fix our attention on the approaching storm ! "
94148	94187	94099	94099	herself	152	" And they say the starry choir And the other listening things That Israfeli 's fire Is owing to that lyre , By which lie sits and sings , - The trembling living wire Of those unusual strings . "

94476	94481	94482	94482	he	104	" You were inspired , "
94492	94500	94482	94482	he	104	" you did not observe our entrance . "
94555	94562	94564	94565	Mr. Challoner	199	" That was a good one , "
94567	94582	94564	94565	Mr. Challoner	199	" There was nothing undecided about that clap . Its mind was made up . "
94598	94606	94607	94607	she	152	" I wonder if it is raining , "
94619	94628	94629	94629	she	93	" Oh , do n't open the blinds ! "
94632	94638	94629	94629	she	93	" It is really dangerous ! "
94649	94668	94669	94669	he	104	" Take a seat on the other side of the room , if you are alarmed , madame , "
94815	94838	94811	94811	he	104	" In a thunderstorm , it is safer to have the windows open than shut ; besides , one can not suffocate . "
94913	94918	94920	94921	Mrs. Challoner	156	" This is magnificent ! "
94953	94982	94920	94921	Mrs. Challoner	156	" I do n't think I ever saw anything like it , John dear , even that storm we saw at Chamounix was not any better than this . "
94983	94986	94988	94989	her husband	317	" Well , "
94992	95040	94988	94989	her husband	317	" you see we had the snow mountains there , and the effect was pretty lively . Then there were the echoes - those cavernous echoes were grand ! What was that passage in Job , Effie , that I used to say they reminded me of ? "
95041	95067	95069	95070	Effie Challoner	159	" ' The pillars of heaven tremble , and are astonished at His reproof ... The thunder of His power , who can understand ? ' "
95073	95078	95079	95079	he	317	" That 's it ! "
95082	95101	95079	95079	he	317	" I opine that Job was pretty correct in his ideas - do n't you , reverend sir ? "
95118	95135	95136	95136	he	1335	" That lady - Mrs. Everard - is going to sing or play , I think , "
95139	95146	95136	95136	he	1335	" Shall we not keep silence ? "
95215	95220	95197	95197	her	93	" Good - bye ! "
95248	95284	95286	95286	Amy	93	" Hush ! a voice from the far - away , ' Listen and learn , ' it seems to say ; ' All the to - morrows shall be as to - day , ' "
95329	95335	95336	95337	Mrs. Challoner	156	" You will catch cold ! "
95375	95401	95358	95358	her	93	" The link must break , and the lamp must die ; Good - bye to Hope ! Good - bye - good - bye ! "
95620	95627	95629	95630	Colonel Everard	92	" That was a nasty flash , "
95647	95657	95629	95630	Colonel Everard	92	" Mademoiselle , had you not better come in ? "
95658	95669	95670	95670	she	152	" When it begins to rain I will come in , "
95678	95695	95670	95670	she	152	" I hear the singing so well out here . Besides , I love the storm . "
95726	95782	95629	95630	Colonel Everard	92	" What are we waiting for ? Oh , my heart ! Kiss me straight on the brows and part ! Again ! again , my heart , my heart ! What are we waiting for , you and I ? A pleading look - a stifled cry ! Good - bye for ever - - "
95946	95951	95938	95938	Amy	93	" Good - bye ! "
95969	95979	95953	95953	she	152	" What has happened ? What is the matter ? "
95980	95991	95992	95992	I	0	" She has been stunned by a lightning - flash , "
96028	96037	96021	96022	Mrs. Challoner	156	" She will recover in a few minutes . "
96219	96232	96233	96233	he	104	" I should be glad of other medical skill than my own , "
96242	96252	96233	96233	he	104	" This may be a long fainting - fit . "
96261	96271	96272	96272	he	104	" I 'll go for you anywhere you like , "
96276	96349	96272	96272	he	104	" and I think my wife and daughters had better come with me . Our carriage is sure to be in waiting . It will be necessary for the lady to have perfect quiet when she recovers , and visitors are best away . You need not be alarmed , I am sure . By her colour it is evident she is only in a swoon . What doctor shall I send ? "
96362	96409	96350	96350	Heliobas	104	" Right ! He shall be here straight . Come , wife - come , girls ! Mrs. Everard , we 'll send back our carriage for you and the Colonel . Good - night ! We 'll call to - morrow and inquire after mademoiselle . "
96583	96588	96589	96589	she	152	" I am frightened , "
96592	96623	96589	96589	she	152	" I can not bear it - she looks so still , and she is growing - rigid , like a corpse ! Oh , if she should be dead ! "
96700	96703	96705	96706	Colonel Everard	92	" Then , "
96711	96744	96705	96706	Colonel Everard	92	" I 'll take Amy home . She is thoroughly upset , and it 's no use having her going off into hysterics . I 'll call with Challoner to - morrow ; "
96892	96897	96882	96882	I	0	" Zara ! Zara ! "
96989	96994	96995	96995	I	0	" You - you ! "
96999	97070	96995	96995	I	0	" YOU can restore her ! Do as you did with Prince Ivan ; you can - you must ! That stone she wears - the light has gone out of it . If that means - and I am sure it does - that life has for a little while gone out of HER , YOU can bring it back . Quick - Quick ! You have the power ! "
97094	97100	97101	97101	he	104	" I have NO power , "
97104	97138	97101	97101	he	104	" Not over her . I told you she was dominated by a higher force than mine . What can I do ? Nothing - worse than nothing - I am utterly helpless . "
97150	97158	97159	97159	I	0	" Do you mean to tell me , "
97163	97172	97159	97159	I	0	" that she is dead - really dead ? "
97191	97195	97180	97184	one of the watching servants	1377	" Dr. Morini . "
97283	97291	97273	97273	his	1379	" How and when did this happen ? "
97406	97411	97413	97414	Dr. Morini	235	" Death by electricity , "
97417	97464	97413	97414	Dr. Morini	235	" Must have been instantaneous . The lightning - flash , or downward electric current , lodged itself here , where this mark is , and passed directly through the heart . Perfectly painless , but of course fatal . She has been dead some time . "
97654	97722	97649	97649	I	0	" Oh , no , no ! Not that ! That is for the dead ; Zara is not dead ! It is all a mistake - a mistake ! She will be quite well presently ; and she will smile and tell you how foolish you were to think her dead ! Dead ? She can not be dead ; it is impossible - quite impossible ! "
97793	97881	97787	97787	he	235	" Mademoiselle , you can do no good by giving way in this manner . Death is a very beautiful and solemn thing , and it is irreverent to show unseemly passion in such a great Presence . You loved your friend - let it be a comfort to you that she died painlessly . Control yourself , in order to assist in rendering her the last few gentle services necessary ; and try to console the desolate brother , who looks in real need of encouragement . "
97899	97906	97907	97907	I	0	" I will , Dr. Morini , "
97915	97943	97907	97907	I	0	" I am ashamed to be so weak . I know what I ought to do , and I will do it . You may trust me . "
97950	97955	97956	97956	he	1386	" That is well , "
97960	97991	97956	97956	he	1386	" And now , as I am of no use here , I will say good - night . Remember , excessive grief is mere selfishness ; resignation is heroism . "
98368	98375	98376	98376	I	0	" Did you hear the organ ? "
98391	98396	98379	98380	The woman	2044	" No , mademoiselle . "
98673	98683	98663	98663	I	0	" Zara , Zara ! you have come back ! "
98694	98749	98684	98684	Her	152	" To life ? Ah , never , never again ! I am too happy to return . But save him - save my brother ! Go to him ; he is in danger ; to you is given the rescue . Save him ; and for me rejoice , and grieve no more ! "
98823	98831	98819	98819	SHE	152	" Save him - save my brother ! "
98950	98956	98957	98957	I	0	" What are you doing ? "
98965	98984	98961	98961	myself	0	" With the dead body of your sister in the house you can fight ! You , too ! "
98993	99010	98986	98986	I	0	" you also can desecrate the sanctity of death , and yet - you LOVED her ! "
99108	99112	99113	99113	he	104	" This GENTLEMAN , "
99120	99241	99113	99113	he	104	" happened , on his way thither , to meet Dr. Morini , who informed him of the fatal catastrophe which has caused my sister 's death . Instead of respecting the sacredness of my solitude under the circumstances , he thrust himself rudely into my presence , and , before I could address him , struck me violently in the face , and accused me of being my sister 's murderer . Such conduct can only meet with one reply . I gave him his choice of weapons : he chose swords . Our combat has just begun - we are anxious to resume it ; therefore if you , mademoiselle , will have the goodness to retire - - "
99246	99253	99254	99254	I	0	" I shall certainly not retire , "
99258	99305	99254	99254	I	0	" This behaviour on both your parts is positive madness . Prince Ivan , please to listen to me . The circumstances of Zara 's death were plainly witnessed by me and others - her brother is as innocent of having caused it as I am . "
99357	99363	99364	99364	he	1416	" I wonder , mademoiselle , "
99367	99531	99364	99364	he	1416	" that your residence in this accursed house has not taught you better . I quite believe all you say , that Zara , unfortunate girl that she was , received her death by a lightning - flash . But answer me this : Who made her capable of attracting atmospheric electricity ? Who charged her beautiful delicate body with a vile compound of electrical fluid , so that she was as a living magnet , bound to draw towards herself electricity in all its forms ? Who tampered with her fine brain and made her imagine herself allied to a spirit of air ? Who but HE - HE ! - yonder unscrupulous wretch ! - he who in pursuit of his miserable science , practised his most dangerous experiments on his sister , regardless of her health , her happiness , her life ! I say he is her murderer - her remorseless murderer , and a thrice - damned villain ! "
99551	99554	99555	99555	I	0	" Stop ! "
99558	99570	99555	99555	I	0	" this can not go on . Zara herself forbids it ! "
99585	99590	99591	99591	he	708	" Zara forbids it ! "
99594	99600	99591	99591	he	708	" What do you mean ? "
99601	99605	99606	99606	I	0	" I mean , "
99610	99632	99606	99606	I	0	" that I have seen Zara since her death ; I have spoken to her . She herself sent me here . "
99647	99651	99652	99652	he	153	" Little fool ! "
99657	99690	99652	99652	he	153	" he has maddened you too , then ! You are also a victim ! Miserable girl ! out of my path ! Revenge - revenge ! while I am yet sane ! "
99708	99727	99697	99697	he	153	" Hand to hand , villain ! No more of these toy - weapons ! Hand to hand ! "
100138	100141	100142	100142	I	0	" Heliobas ! "
100144	100173	100142	100142	I	0	" Remember , remember Azul ! When Death lies like a gift in your hand , withhold it . Withhold it , Heliobas ; and give Life instead ! "
100293	100300	100301	100301	he	153	" I thank and bless you , "
100304	100326	100301	100301	he	153	" you reminded me in time ! Another moment and it would have been too late . You have saved me . "
100327	100333	100334	100334	I	0	" Give him his life , "
100341	100346	100348	100348	Heliobas	104	" He has it , "
100350	100451	100348	100348	Heliobas	104	" I have not taken it from him , thank God ! He provoked me ; I regret it . I should have been more patient with him . He will revive immediately . I leave him to your care . In dealing with him , I ought to have remembered that human passion like his , unguided by spiritual knowledge , was to be met with pity and forbearance . As it is , however , he is safe . For me , I will go and pray for Zara 's pardon , and that of my wronged Azul . "
100468	100522	100530	100530	he	1427	" My beautiful one ! Thou HAST pardoned me ? Thou wilt love me still ? Thou art with me , Azul , my beloved ? I have not lost thee , oh my best and dearest ! Wilt thou lead me ? Whither ? Nay - no matter whither - I come ! "
100618	100623	100611	100611	he	1427	" What has happened ? "
100651	100659	100642	100642	he	1427	" Where is the coward and murderer ? "
100755	100765	100766	100766	I	0	" Disbelieve as you will in electric spiritual force , "
100769	100787	100766	100766	I	0	" Your message to her then through me was - TELL HER I HAVE SEEN HER LOVER . "
100801	100806	100807	100807	he	1427	" I tell you , "
100811	100978	100807	100807	he	1427	" that I believe I was on that occasion the victim of an hallucination . But I will explain to you what I saw . A superb figure , like , and yet unlike , a man , but of a much larger and grander form , appeared to me , as I thought , and spoke . ' Zara is mine , ' it said - ' mine by choice ; mine by freewill ; mine till death ; mine after death ; mine through eternity . With her thou hast naught in common ; thy way lies elsewhere . Follow the path allotted to thee , and presume no more upon an angel 's patience . ' Then this Strange majestic - looking creature , whose face , as I remember it , was extraordinarily beautiful , and whose eyes were like self - luminous stars , vanished . But , after all , what of it ? The whole thing was a dream . "
100979	100988	100989	100989	I	0	" I am not so sure of that , "
100993	101019	100989	100989	I	0	" But , Prince Ivan , now that you are calmer and more capable of resignation , will you tell me why you loved Zara ? "
101020	101023	101024	101024	he	1435	" Why ! "
101029	101041	101024	101024	he	1435	" Why , because it was impossible to help loving her . "
101042	101048	101049	101049	I	0	" That is no answer , "
101052	101080	101049	101049	I	0	" Think ! You can reason well if you like - I have heard you hold your own in an argument . What made you love Zara ? "
101110	101121	101122	101122	he	1435	" She was the loveliest woman I have ever seen ! "
101140	101145	101146	101146	I	0	" Is THAT all ? "
101155	101351	101146	101146	I	0	" Because her body was beautiful - because she had sweet kissing lips and a soft skin ; because her hand was like a white flower , and her dark hair clustering over her brow reminded one of a misty evening cloud hiding moonlight ; because the glance of her glorious eyes made the blood leap through your veins and sting you with passionate desire - are these the reasons of your so - called love ? Oh , give it some other and lower name ! For the worms shall feed on the fair flesh that won your admiration - their wet and slimy bodies shall trail across the round white arms and tender bosom - unsightly things shall crawl among the tresses of the glossy hair ; and nothing , nothing shall remain of what you loved , but dust . Prince Ivan , you shudder ; but I too loved Zara - I loved HER , not the perishable casket in which , like a jewel , she was for a time enshrined . I love her still - and for the being I love there is no such thing as death . "
101377	101387	101388	101388	he	708	" I loved her as a man generally loves , "
101396	101407	101388	101388	he	708	" Nay - more than most men love most women ! "
101408	101422	101423	101423	I	0	" Most men are too often selfish in both their loves and hatreds , "
101426	101465	101423	101423	I	0	" Tell me if there was anything in Zara 's mind and intelligence to attract you ? Did you sympathize in her pursuits ; did you admire her tastes ; had you any ideas in common with her ? "
101466	101475	101476	101476	he	708	" No , I confess I had not , "
101480	101530	101532	101532	he	708	" I considered her to be entirely a victim to her brother 's scientific experiments . I thought , by making her my wife , to release her from such tyranny and give her rescue and refuge . To this end I found out all I could from - HIM "
101541	101580	101532	101532	he	708	" and I made up my mind that her delicate imagination had been morbidly excited ; but that marriage and a life like that led by other women would bring her to a more healthy state of mind . "
101588	101600	101601	101601	I	0	" Your presumption was almost greater than your folly , Prince , "
101604	101695	101601	101601	I	0	" that with such ideas as these in your mind you could dream of winning Zara for a wife . Do you think she could have led a life like that of other women ? A frivolous round of gaiety , a few fine dresses and jewels , small - talk , society scandal , stale compliments - you think such things would have suited HER ? And would she have contented herself with a love like yours ? Come ! Come and see how well she has escaped you ! "
101707	101714	101715	101715	he	1437	" Where would you take me ? "
101718	101729	101697	101697	I	0	" To the chapel . Zara 's body lies there . "
101733	101774	101730	101730	He	1437	" No , no - not there ! I can not bear to look upon her perished loveliness - to see that face , once so animated , white and rigid - death in such a form is too horrible ! "
101806	101815	101816	101816	I	0	" And yet you are a brave man ! "
101958	101974	101975	101975	I	0	" You need not look upon Zara 's corpse unless you wish it , Prince , "
101978	102279	101975	101975	I	0	" To you , the mysteries of the Hereafter have not been unlocked , because there is something in your nature that can not and will not believe in God . Therefore to you , death must be repellent . I know you are one of those for whom the present alone exists - you easily forget the past , and take no trouble for the future . Paris is your heaven , or St. Petersburg , or Vienna , as the fancy takes you ; and the modern atheistical doctrines of French demoralization are in your blood . Nothing but a heaven - sent miracle could make you other than you are , and miracles do not exist for the materialist . But let me say two words more before you go from this house . Seek no more to avenge yourself for your love - disappointment on Heliobas - for you have really nothing to avenge . By your own confession you only cared for Zara 's body - that body was always perishable , and it has perished by a sudden but natural catastrophe . With her soul , you declare you had nothing in common - that was herself - and she is alive to us who love her as she sought to be loved . Heliobas is innocent of having slain her body ; he but helped to cultivate and foster that beautiful Spirit which he knew to be HER - for that he is to be honored and commended . Promise me , therefore , Prince Ivan , that you will never approach him again except in friendship - indeed , you owe him an apology for your unjust accusation , as also your gratitude for his sparing your life in the recent struggle . "
102307	102315	102316	102316	he	708	" Your words are compelling , mademoiselle , "
102319	102379	102316	102316	he	708	" and you have a strange attraction for me . I know I am not wrong in thinking that you are a disciple of Heliobas , whose science I admit , though I doubt his theories . I promise you willingly what you ask - nay , I will even offer him my hand if he will accept it . "
102388	102402	102385	102385	I	0	" He is in the chapel , but I will fetch him here . "
102458	102497	102445	102445	he	708	" No ; I will go to him myself . And I will look again upon - upon the face I loved . It is but one pang the more , and why should I not endure it ? "
102741	102748	102724	102724	his	708	" O God ! how cold ! "
102819	102833	102834	102834	he	104	" In HER name , let there be peace between us , Ivan , "
102885	102895	102898	102898	Ivan	153	" I have to ask your pardon , Casimir , "
102900	102911	102898	102898	Ivan	153	" I have also to thank you for my life . "
102912	102921	102923	102923	Heliobas	104	" Thank the friend who stands beside you , "
102938	102983	102923	102923	Heliobas	104	" She reminded me of a duty in time . As for pardon , I know of no cause of offence on your part save what was perfectly excusable . Say no more ; wisdom comes with years , and you are yet young . "
103248	103284	103239	103239	I	0	" Yes , Heaven is thine , but this Is a world of sweets and sours - Our flowers are merely FLOWERS ; And the shadow of thy perfect bliss Is the sunshine of ours . "
103309	103331	103302	103302	himself	153	" I will intrude no longer on your privacy , Casimir . Farewell ! I shall leave Paris to - night . "
103371	103999	103363	103363	he	104	" Ivan , something tells me that you and I shall not meet again for many years , if ever . Therefore , when you say ' farewell , ' the word falls upon my ears with double meaning . We are friends - our friendship is sanctified by the dead presence of one whom we both loved , in different ways ; therefore you will take in good part what I now say to you . You know , you can not disguise from yourself that the science I study is fraught with terrible truth and marvellous discoveries ; the theories I deduce from it you disbelieve , because you are nearly a materialist . I say NEARLY - not quite . That ' not quite ' makes me love you , Ivan : I would save the small bright spark that flickers within you from both escape and extinction . But I can not - at least , not as yet . Still , in order that you may know that there is a power in me higher than ordinary human reason , before you go from me to - night hear my prophecy of your career . The world waits for you , Ivan - the world , all agape and glittering with a thousand sparkling toys ; it waits greedy for your presence , ready to fawn upon you for a smile , willing to cringe to you for a nod of approval . And why ? Because wealth is yours - vast , illimitable wealth . Aye - you need not start or look incredulous - you will find it as I say . You , whose fortune up to now has barely reached a poor four thousand per annum - you are at this moment the possessor of millions . Only last night a relative of yours , whose name you scarcely know , expired , leaving all his hoarded treasures to you . Before the close of this present day , on whose threshold we now stand , you will have the news . When you receive it remember me , and acknowledge that at least for once I knew and spoke the truth . Follow the broad road , Ivan , laid out before you - a road wide enough not only for you to walk in , but for the crowd of toadies and flatterers also , who will push on swiftly after you and jostle you on all sides ; be strong of heart and merry of countenance ! Gather the roses ; press the luscious grapes into warm , red wine that , as you quaff it , shall make your blood dance a mad waltz in your veins , and fair women 's faces shall seem fairer to you than ever , their embraces more tender , their kisses more tempting ! Spin the ball of Society like a toy in the palm of your hand ! I see your life stretching before me like a brilliant , thread - like ephemeral ray of light ! But in the far distance across it looms a shadow - a shadow that your power alone can never lift . Mark me , Ivan ! When the first dread chill of that shadow makes itself felt , come to me - I shall yet be living . Come ; for then no wealth can aid you - at that dark hour no boon companions can comfort . Come ; and by our friendship so lately sworn - by Zara 's pure soul - by God 's existence , I will not die till I have changed that darkness over you into light eternal ! - Fare you well ! "
104080	104093	104094	104094	he	1460	" Casimir told me that your intercession saved my life , mademoiselle , "
104097	104114	104094	104094	he	1460	" Accept my poor thanks . If his present prophet - like utterances be true - - "
104115	104122	104123	104123	I	0	" Why should you doubt him ? "
104130	104137	104123	104123	I	0	" Can you believe in NOTHING ? "
104156	104164	104165	104165	he	708	" I think you have hit it , "
104169	104258	104165	104165	he	708	" I doubt everything except the fact of my own existence , and there are times when I am not even sure of that . But if , as I said before , the prophecy of my Chaldean friend , whom I can not help admiring with all my heart , turns out to be correct , then my life is more valuable to me than ever with such wealth to balance it , and I thank you doubly for having saved it by a word in time . "
104267	104279	104280	104280	Tasked	240	" You think the worth of your life increased by wealth ? "
104282	104289	104280	104280	Tasked	240	" Naturally ! Money is power . "
104290	104304	104309	104309	his	708	" And what of the shadow also foretold as inseparable from your fate ? "
104312	104337	104280	104280	Tasked	240	" Ah , pardon me ! That is the only portion of Casimir 's fortune - telling that I am inclined to disbelieve thoroughly . "
104338	104341	104342	104342	I	0	" But , "
104345	104370	104342	104342	I	0	" if you are willing to accept the pleasant part of his prophecy , why not admit the possibility of the unpleasant occurring also ? "
104376	104432	104371	104371	He	708	" In these enlightened times , mademoiselle , we only believe what is agreeable to us , and what suits our own wishes , tastes , and opinions . Ca va sans dire . We can not be forced to accept a Deity against our reason . That is a grand result of modern education . "
104433	104437	104439	104439	I	0	" Is it ? "
104446	104508	104439	104439	I	0	" Poor human reason ! It will reel into madness sometimes for a mere trifle - an overdose of alcohol will sometimes upset it altogether - what a noble omnipotent thing is human reason ! But let me not detain you . Good - bye , and - as the greeting of olden times used to run - God save you ! "
104518	104530	104531	104531	he	708	" I believe you to be a good , sweet woman , "
104534	104546	104531	104531	he	708	" therefore I am grateful for your blessing . My mother , "
104556	104595	104597	104597	his	708	" poor soul ! she died long ago - my mother would never let me retire to rest without signing the cross on my brow . Ah well , that is past ! I should like , mademoiselle , "
104603	104615	104597	104597	his	708	" to send some flowers for - her - you understand ? "
104647	104656	104643	104643	he	708	" more than most men love most women . "
104990	104996	104997	104997	he	104	" Do it at once , "
105001	105036	104997	104997	he	104	" Take my Armenians ; they are discreet , obedient , and they ask no questions - with strong hammers they will soon crush the clay . Stay ! I will come with you . "
105047	105072	105043	105043	he	104	" You have eaten nothing , my child ? You can not ? But your strength will give way - here , take this . "
105118	105143	105115	105115	he	104	" I also have a commission in charge from Zara . You know , I suppose , that she was prepared for her death ? "
105144	105158	105159	105159	I	0	" I did not know ; but I think she must have been , "
105162	105281	105283	105283	he	1479	" She was . We both were . We remained together in the chapel all day , saying what parting words we had to say to one another . We knew her death , or rather her release , was to occur at some hour that night ; but in what way the end was destined to come , we knew not . Till I heard the first peals of thunder , I was in suspense ; but after that I was no longer uncertain . You were a witness of the whole ensuing scene . No death could have been more painless than hers . But let me not forget the message she gave me for you . "
105297	105303	105304	105304	he	1479	" This jewel is yours , "
105307	105416	105304	105304	he	1479	" You need not fear to accept it - it contains no harm ! it will bring you no ill - fortune . You see how all the sparkling brilliancy has gone out of it ? Wear it , and within a few minutes it will be as lustrous as ever . The life throbbing in your veins warms the electricity contained in it ; and with the flowing of your blood , its hues change and glow . It has no power to attract ; it can simply absorb and shine . Take it as a remembrance of her who loved you and who loves you still . "
105506	105513	105514	105514	I	0	" I will always wear it , "
105518	105528	105514	105514	I	0	" I believe it will bring me good fortune . "
105529	105535	105537	105537	Heliobas	104	" I believe it will , "
105540	105551	105537	105537	Heliobas	104	" And now let us fulfil Zara 's other commands . "
105747	105752	105754	105754	Zara	152	" Omnia vincit Amor , "
105807	105868	105798	105798	Zara	152	" To my beloved Casimir - my brother , my friend , my guide and teacher , to whom I owe the supreme happiness of my life in this world and the next - let this poor figure of his grateful Zara be a memento of happy days that are gone , only to be renewed with redoubled happiness hereafter . "
106269	106329	106256	106256	he	104	" These ignorant folk , who serve me for money and food - money that they have eagerly taken , and food that they have greedily devoured - they think that I am the devil or one of the devil 's agents , and I am going to prove their theories entirely to their satisfaction . Come and see ! "
106344	106355	106341	106341	he	104	" Do you know why Zara wished that statue destroyed ? "
106356	106359	106360	106360	I	0	" No , "
106364	106374	106360	106360	I	0	" unless for the reason that it was incomplete . "
106375	106383	106385	106385	Heliobas	104	" It always would have been incomplete , "
106387	106465	106385	106385	Heliobas	104	" even had she lived to work at it for years . It was a daring attempt , and a fruitless one . She was trying to make a clay figure of one who never wore earthly form - the Being who is her Twin - Soul , who dominates her entirely , and who is with her now . As well might she have tried to represent in white marble the prismatic hues of the rainbow ! "
106586	106611	106576	106576	his	104	" I have sent for you all this morning , because I am perfectly aware that you have all determined to give me notice . "
106636	106650	106628	106628	I	0	" He IS the devil , or how could he have known it ? "
106666	106862	106662	106662	He	104	" I spare you this trouble . Knowing your intentions , I take upon myself to dismiss you at once . Naturally , you can not risk your characters by remaining in the service of the devil . For my own part , I wonder the devil 's money has not burnt your hands , or his food turned to poison in your mouths . My sister , your kind and ever - indulgent mistress , is dead . You know this , and it is your opinion that I summoned up the thunderstorm which caused her death . Be it so . Report it so , if you will , through Paris ; your words do not affect me . You have been excellent machines , and for your services many thanks ! As soon as my sister 's funeral is over , your wages , with an additional present , will be sent to you . You can then leave my house when you please ; and , contrary to the usual custom of accepted devils , I am able to say , without perishing in the effort - God speed you all ! "
106893	106904	106905	106905	he	1474	" The master knows that I will never leave him , "
106957	107000	106947	106947	his	104	" My lord will not surely dismiss US who desire to devote ourselves to his service ? We are willing to follow my lord to the death if need be , for the sake of the love and honour we bear him . "
107008	107021	107022	107022	he	104	" I am richer in friends than I thought myself to be , "
107026	107053	107054	107054	he	104	" Stay then , by all means , Afra , you and your companions , since you have desired it . And you , my boy , "
107063	107107	107054	107054	he	104	" think you that I would turn adrift an orphan , whom a dying mother trusted to my care ? Nay , child , I am as much your servant as you are mine , so long as your love turns towards me . "
107151	107162	107163	107163	he	104	" Go , all of you , scum of Paris ! "
107171	107286	107163	107163	he	104	" you who know neither God nor devil ! You will have your money - more than your share - what else seek you ? You have served one of the noblest of men ; and because he is so great and wise and true , you judge him a fiend ! Oh , so like the people of Paris - they who pervert all things till they think good evil and evil good ! Look you ! you have worked for your wages ; but I have worked for HIM - I would starve with him , I would die for him ! For to me he is not fiend , but Angel ! "
107327	107334	107335	107335	he	104	" What are you waiting for ? "
107338	107379	107335	107335	he	104	" Consider yourselves dismissed , and at liberty to go where you please . Any one of you that chooses to apply to me for a character shall not lack the suitable recommendation . There is no more to say . "
107393	107398	107399	107399	she	1529	" I am sure , "
107407	107478	107399	107399	she	1529	" that we are very sorry if we have unintentionally wronged monsieur ; but monsieur , who is aware of so many things , must know that many reports are circulated about monsieur that make one to shudder ; that madame his sister 's death so lamentable has given to all , what one would say , the horrors ; and monsieur must consider that poor servants of virtuous reputation - "
107479	107485	107487	107487	Heliobas	104	" So , Jeanne Claudet ! "
107495	107541	107487	107487	Heliobas	104	" And what of the child - the little waxen - faced helpless babe left to die on the banks of the Loire ? But it did not die , Jeanne - it was rescued ; and it shall yet live to loathe its mother ! "
107628	107649	107651	107652	the Colonel	1857	" Since she heard of the death of that beautiful young lady , a death so fearfully sudden and unexpected , "
107699	107699	107688	107688	she	322	"
107716	107779	107709	107709	He	104	" Of course you must go . Wait till our simple funeral ceremony is over , and then - we part . Not for ever ; I shall see you often again . For now I have lost Zara , you are my only female disciple , and I shall not willingly lose sight of you . You will correspond with me ? "
107780	107785	107786	107786	I	0	" Gladly and gratefully , "
107789	107939	107709	107709	He	104	" You shall not lose by it . I can initiate you into many secrets that will be useful to you in your career . As for your friend Mrs. Everard , you will find that your presence will cure her . You have progressed greatly in electric force : the mere touch of your hand will soothe her , as you will find . But never be tempted to try any of the fluids of which you have the recipes on her , or on anybody but yourself , unless you write to me first about it , as Cellini did when he tried an experiment on you . As for your own bodily and spiritual health , you know thoroughly what to do - KEEP THE SECRET ; and make a step in advance every day . By - and - by you will have double work . "
107940	107944	107945	107945	I	0	" How so ? "
107948	108177	107709	107709	He	104	" In Zara 's case , her soul became dominated by a Spirit whose destiny was fulfilled and perfect , and who never could descend to imprisonment in earthly clay . Now , you will not be dominated - you will be simply EQUALIZED ; that is , you will find the exact counterpart of your own soul dwelling also in human form , and you will have to impart your own force to that other soul , which will , in its turn , impart to yours a corresponding electric impetus . There is no union so lovely as such an one - no harmony so exquisite ; it is like a perfect chord , complete and indissoluble . There are sevenths and ninths in music , beautiful and effective in their degrees ; but perhaps none of them are so absolutely satisfying to the ear as the perfect chord . And this is your lot in life and in love , my child - be grateful for it night and morning on your bended knees before the Giver of all good . And walk warily - your own soul with that other shall need much thought and humble prayer . Aim onward and upward - you know the road - you also know , and you have partly seen , what awaits you at the end . "
108367	108372	108373	108373	he	204	" She is happy ! "

It is , however , enough to tell you that you have fulfilled all that was expected of you , even beyond my best hopes ; and in return for your services , the worth of which you can not realize , whatever guidance I can give you in the future for your physical and spiritual life , is yours . I have done something for you , but not much - I will do more . Only , in communicating with me , I ask you to honour me with your full confidence in all matters pertaining to yourself and your surroundings - then I shall not be liable to errors of judgment in the opinions I form or the advice I give .

Write with it on any paper , and the marks will be like those of an ordinary drawing - pencil ; but as fast as they are written they disappear . Trouble not about this circumstance - write all you have to say , and when you have finished your letter your closely covered pages shall seem blank . Therefore , were the eye of a stranger to look at them , nothing could be learned therefrom .

They were known to the ancients , and many secret letters , laws , histories , and poems were written with instruments such as these . In an old library , destroyed more than two centuries ago , there was a goodly pile of apparently blank parchment . Had I lived then and known what I know now , I could have made the white pages declare their mystery . "

Avoid it as you would the plague . Believe in anything or everything miraculous and glorious - the utmost reach of your faith can with difficulty grasp the majestic reality and perfection of everything you can see , desire , or imagine . Mistrust that volatile thing called Human Reason , which is merely a name for whatever opinion we happen to adopt for the time - it is a thing which totters on its throne in a fit of rage or despair - there is nothing infinite about it . Guide yourself by the delicate Spiritual Instinct within you , which tells you that with God all things are possible , save that He can not destroy Himself or lessen by one spark the fiery brilliancy of his ever - widening circle of productive Intelligence . But make no attempt to convert the world to your way of thinking - it would be mere waste of time . "

111019	111179	110814	110814	he	1587	" You can try , if you choose ; but you will find most human beings like the herd of swine in the Gospel , possessed by devils that drive them headlong into the sea . You know , for instance , that angels and aerial spirits actually exist ; but were you to assert your belief in them , philosophers so - called would scout your theories as absurd , - though their idea of a LONELY God , who yet is Love , is the very acme of absurdity . For Love MUST have somewhat to love , and MUST create the beauty and happiness round itself and the things beloved . But why point out these simple things to those who have no desire to see ? Be content , child , that YOU have been deemed worthy of instruction - it is a higher fate for you than if you had been made a Queen . "
111226	111534	111211	111211	his	104	" One word more , little friend , on the subject of your career . I think the time will come when you will feel that music is almost too sacred a thing to be given away for money to a careless and promiscuous public . However this may be , remember that scarce one of the self - styled artists who cater for the crowd deserves to be called MUSICIAN in the highest sense of the word . Most of them seek not music , but money and applause ; and therefore the art they profess is degraded by them into a mere trade . But you , when you play in public , must forget that PERSONS with little vanities and lesser opinions exist . Think of what you saw in your journey with Azul ; and by a strong effort of your will , you can , if you choose , COMPEL certain harmonies to sound in your ears - fragments of what is common breathing air to the Children of the Ring , some of whom you saw - and you will be able to reproduce them in part , if not in entirety . But if you once admit a thought of Self to enter your brain , those aerial sounds will be silenced instantly . By this means , too , you can judge who are the true disciples of music in this world - those who , like Schubert and Chopin , suffered the heaven - born melodies to descend THROUGH them as though they were mere conductors of sound ; or those who , feebly imitating other composers , measure out crotchets and quavers by rule and line , and flood the world with inane and perishable , and therefore useless , productions . And now , - farewell . "

Over it beams a broad sky , deeply blue ; many soft bells caress the summer air . Away in the Cascine Woods a gay party of people are seated on the velvety moss ; they have mandolins , and they sing for pure gaiety of heart . One of them , a woman with fair hair , arrayed in white , with a red rose at her bosom , is gathering the wild flowers that bloom around her , and weaving them into posies for her companions . A stranger , pacing slowly , book in hand , through the shady avenue , sees her - her eyes meet his . She springs up to greet him ; he takes her hand . The woman is yourself ; the stranger no other than your poor friend , who now , for a brief space , takes leave of you ! "

My dear friend Miss F - - , who has written to you lately I believe , first read it to me , and I can not tell you what a want in my life it seemed to fill up . I have been always interested in the so - called Supernatural , feeling very conscious of depths in my own self and in others that are usually ignored . ... I have been reading as many books as I could obtain upon Theosophy , but though thankful for the high thoughts I found in them , I still felt a great want - that of combining this occult knowledge with my own firm belief in the Christian religion . Your book seemed to give me just what I wanted - IT HAS DEEPENED AND STRENGTHENED MY BELIEF IN AND LOVE TO GOD AND HAS MADE THE NEW TESTAMENT A NEW BOOK TO ME . Things which I could not understand before seem clear in the light which your ' Vision ' has thrown upon them , and I can not remain satisfied without expressing to you my sincere gratitude . May your book be read by all who are ready to receive the high truths that it contains ! With thanks , I remain , dear Madam ,

It has opened my mind to such new impressions , and seems to be so much what I have been groping for so long , that I thought if you would be kind enough to answer this , I might get a firmer hold on those higher things and be at anchor at last . If you have patience to read so far , you will imagine I must be very much in earnest to intrude myself on you like this , but from the tone of your book I do not believe you would withdraw your hand where you could do good . ... I never thought of or read of the electric force or spirit in every human being before , but I do believe in it after reading your book , and YOU HAVE MADE THE NEXT WORLD A LIVING THING TO ME , and raised my feelings above the disappointments and trials of this life . ... Your book was put into my hands at a time when I was deeply distressed and in trouble about my future ; but you have shown me how small a thing this future of OUR life is . ... Would it be asking too much of you to name any books you think might help me in this new vein of thought you have given me ? Apologizing for having written , believe me yours sincerely ,

I speak of self - destruction - suicide . And while writing the word , I beg of you to accept my gratitude for the timely rescue of my soul . Once I believed in the goodness of God - but of late years the cry of modern scientific atheism , ' There is NO God , ' has rung in my ears till my brain has reeled at the desolation and nothingness of the Universe . No good , no hope , no satisfaction in anything - this world only with all its mockery and failure - and afterwards annihilation ! Could a God design and create so poor and cruel a jest ? So I thought - and the misery of the thought was more than I could bear . I had resolved to make an end . No one knew , no one guessed my intent , till one Sunday afternoon a friend lent me your book . I began to read , and never left it till I had finished the last page - then I knew I was saved . Life smiled again upon me in consoling colours , and I write to tell you that whatever other good your work may do and is no doubt doing , you have saved both the life and reason of one grateful human being . If you will write to me a few lines I shall be still more grateful , for I feel you can help me . I seem to have read Christ 's mission wrong - but with patience and prayer it is possible to redeem my error . Once more thanking you , I am ,

I have thought much on Theosophy and Psychical Research - but what struck me in your book was the glorious selflessness inculcated and the perfect Majesty of the Divinity clear throughout - no sweeping away of the Crucified One .

I feel sure that many people must have plied you with questions on the subject already , but I am certain that you are too earnest and too sympathetic to feel bored by what is in no sense idle curiosity , but rather a deep and genuine longing to know the truth . ... To some minds it would prove such a comfort and such , a relief to have their vague longings and beliefs confirmed and made tangible , and , as you know , at the present day so - called Religion , which is often a mere mixture of dogma and superstition , is scarcely sufficient to do this . ... I might say a great deal more and weary your patience , which has already been tried , I fear .

With your expressed belief in the good influence which each may exert over the other , not to speak of a higher and holier incentive in the example of One in whom you also believe who bids us for His sake to ' Bear one another 's burdens , ' you can not , I think , turn away in impatience from the seeking of a very earnest soul .

Shame on those men who presume to take up the high vocation of the priesthood for the sake of self - love , self - interest , worldly advancement , money or position ! These things are not among Christ 's teachings .

I have never viewed Christianity in the broadly transfigured light you throw upon it , and I have since been studying carefully the four Gospels and comparing them with the theories in your book . The result has been a complete and happy change in my ideas of religion , and I feel now as if I had , like a leper of old , touched the robe of Christ and been healed of a long - standing infirmity . Will you permit me to ask if you have evolved this new and beneficent lustre from the Gospel yourself ? or whether some experienced student in mystic matters has been your instructor ? I hear from persons who have seen you that you are quite young , and I can not understand how one of your sex and age seems able so easily to throw light on what to many has been , and is still , impenetrable darkness . I have been a preacher for some years , and I thought the Testament was old and familiar to me ; but you have made it a new and marvellous book full of most precious meanings , and I hope I may be able to impart to those whom it is my duty to instruct , something of the great consolation and hope your writing has filled me with .

Is it a part of your own belief ? I am MOST anxious to know this , and I am sure you will be kind enough to answer me . Till I read your book I thought myself an Agnostic , but now I am not quite sure of this . I do not believe in the Deity as depicted by the Churches . I CANNOT . Over and over again I have asked myself - If there is a God , why should He be angry ? It would surely be easy for Him to destroy this world entirely as one would blow away an offending speck of dust , and it would be much better and BRAVER for Him to do this than to torture His creation . For I call life a torture and certainly a useless and cruel torture if it is to end in annihilation . I know I seem to be blasphemous in these remarks , yet if you only knew what I suffer sometimes ! I desire , I LONG to believe . YOU seem so certain of your Creed - a Creed so noble , reasonable and humane - the God you depict so worthy of the adoration of a Universe . I BEG of you to tell me - DO you feel sure of this beneficent all - pervading Love concerning which you write so eloquently ? I do not wish to seem an intruder on your most secret thought . I want to believe that YOU believe - and if I felt this , the tenor of my whole life might change . Help me if you can - I stand in real need of help . You may judge I am very deeply in earnest , or I should not have written to you .
