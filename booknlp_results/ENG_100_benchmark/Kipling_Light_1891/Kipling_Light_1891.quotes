10491	10525	10550	10550	I	0	' Between thirty and forty pounds . If it would be any convenience to you , of course we could let you have it at once ; but we usually settle accounts monthly . '

11289	11305	11278	11278	he	147	' I ran it fine , awfully fine , but I 've just scraped through . '
11306	11328	11329	11329	Dick	147	' You have n't much sense , but you 've got a backbone , anyhow . Eat , and talk afterwards . '

11375	11382	11373	11373	he	147	' That 's heavenly ! Well ? '
11383	11395	11329	11329	Dick	147	' Why in the world did n't you come to me ? '
11396	11472	11373	11373	he	147	' Could n't ; I owe you too much already , old man . Besides I had a sort of superstition that this temporary starvation - that 's what it was , and it hurt - would bring me luck later . It 's over and done with now , and none of the syndicate know how hard up I was . Fire away . What 's the exact state of affairs as regards myself ? '

12336	12378	12254	12254	Torpenhow	156	' That is er - is what I came to speak about . I fear we ca n't allow it exactly , Mr. Heldar . In the absence of any specified agreement , the sketches are our property , of course . '

Sketches such as yours - - '
12453	12488	12254	12254	Torpenhow	156	' Belong to me . You engaged me by wire , you paid me the lowest rates you dared . You ca n't mean to keep them ! Good God alive , man , they 're

13308	13352	13302	13302	Dick	147	' Phew ! what a lawless lot these people are ! The first thing a poor orphan meets is gang robbery , organised burglary ! Think of the hideous blackness of that man 's mind ! Are my sketches all right , Torp ? '
13353	13378	13491	13491	Torpenhow	156	' Yes ; one hundred and forty - seven of them . Well , I must say , Dick , you 've begun well . '
13379	13446	13302	13302	Dick	147	' He was interfering with me . It only meant a few pounds to him , but it was everything to me . I do n't think he 'll bring an action . I gave him some medical advice gratis about the state of his body . It was cheap at the little flurry it cost him . Now , let 's look at my things . '

13793	13816	13753	13753	Torpenhow	156	' I want more , - heaps more . The lean years have passed , and I approve of these fat ones . '

14056	14091	13957	13957	Dick	147	' Never mind . I sold every shred of canvas I wanted to ; and , on my word , I believe it was because they believed I was a self - taught flagstone artist .
14140	14230	13957	13957	Dick	147	'em . I met a fellow the other day who told me that it was impossible that shadows on white sand should be blue , - ultramarine , - as they are . I found out , later , that the man had been as far as Brighton beach ; but he knew all about Art , confound him . He gave me a lecture on it , and recommended me to go to school to learn technique . I wonder what old Kami would have said to that . '
14231	14243	14124	14124	they	750	' When were you under Kami , man of extraordinary beginnings ? '
14244	14326	13957	13957	Dick	147	' I studied with him for two years in Paris . He taught by personal magnetism . All he ever said was , " Continuez , mes enfants , " and you had to make the best you could of that . He had a divine touch , and he knew something about colour . Kami used to dream colour ; I swear he could never have seen the genuine article ; but he evolved it ; and it was good . '
14327	14337	14339	14339	Torpenhow	156	' Recollect some of those views in the Soudan ? '
14352	14425	14426	14426	He	147	' Do n't ! It makes me want to get out there again . What colour that was ! Opal and umber and amber and claret and brick - red and sulphur - cockatoo - crest - sulphur - against brown , with a nigger - black rock sticking up in the middle of it all , and a decorative frieze of camels festooning in front of a pure pale turquoise sky . '
14434	14471	14426	14426	He	147	' And yet , you know , if you try to give these people the thing as God gave it , keyed down to their comprehension and according to the powers He has given you - - '
14472	14479	14426	14426	He	147	' Modest man ! Go on . '
14480	14515	14426	14426	He	147	' Half a dozen epicene young pagans who have n't even been to Algiers will tell you , first , that your notion is borrowed , and , secondly , that it is n't Art .

14544	14551	14553	14553	Dick	147	' I could n't help it , '
14557	14579	14553	14553	Dick	147	' You were n't here , and it was lonely these long evenings . A man ca n't work for ever . '
14580	14595	14426	14426	He	147	' A man might have gone to a pub , and got decently drunk . '
14596	14757	14553	14553	Dick	147	' I wish I had ; but I forgathered with some men of sorts . They said they were artists , and I knew some of them could draw , - but they would n't draw . They gave me tea , - tea at five in the afternoon ! - and talked about Art and the state of their souls . As if their souls mattered . I 've heard more about Art and seen less of her in the last six months than in the whole of my life . Do you remember Cassavetti , who worked for some continental syndicate , out with the desert column ? He was a regular Christmas - tree of contraptions when he took the field in full fig , with his water - bottle , lanyard , revolver , writing - case , housewife , gig - lamps , and the Lord knows what all . He used to fiddle about with 'em

14783	14837	14426	14426	He	147	' Dear old Nilghai ! He 's in town , fatter than ever . He ought to be up here this evening . I see the comparison perfectly . You should have kept clear of all that man - millinery . Serves you right ; and I hope it will unsettle your mind . '
14838	14856	14766	14766	he	759	' It wo n't . It has taught me what Art - holy sacred Art - means . '
14857	14872	14426	14426	He	147	' You 've learnt something while I 've been away . What is Art ? '
14873	14875	14766	14766	he	759	' Give 'em

14903	15040	14892	14892	Dick	147	' Here 's a sample of real Art . It 's going to be a facsimile reproduction for a weekly . I called it " His Last Shot . " It 's worked up from the little water - colour I made outside El Maghrib . Well , I lured my model , a beautiful rifleman , up here with drink ; I drored him , and I redrored him , and I redrored him , and I made him a flushed , dishevelled , bedevilled scallawag , with his helmet at the back of his head , and the living fear of death in his eye , and the blood oozing out of a cut over his ankle - bone . He was n't pretty , but he was all soldier and very much man . '
15041	15048	14892	14892	Dick	147	' Once more , modest child ! '

15586	15651	15577	15577	You	769	' That sounds very fine , but it has nothing to do with the case . They are the people you have to do work for , whether you like it or not . They are your masters . Do n't be deceived , Dickie , you are n't strong enough to trifle with them , - or with yourself , which is more important .

16353	16432	16209	16209	I	0	' Oh , confound your parallels ! Whenever I try to improve your soul , you always drag in some anecdote from your very shady past .

And , I say , if the Nilghai comes up this evening can I show him your diggings ? '

16603	16621	16540	16540	Torpenhow	156	' He does . He 's beginning to take liberties with what he thinks is his reputation . '
16622	16654	16540	16540	Torpenhow	156	' Already ! By Jove , he has cheek ! I do n't know about his reputation , but he 'll come a cropper if he tries that sort of thing . '
16655	16669	16540	16540	Torpenhow	156	' So I told him . I do n't think he believes it . '
16670	16689	16540	16540	Torpenhow	156	' They never do when they first start off . What 's that wreck on the ground there ? '
16690	16697	16698	16698	Torpenhow	156	' Specimen of his latest impertinence . '

16739	16846	16736	16736	he	156	' a chromo - litholeomargarine fake ! What possessed him to do it ? And yet how thoroughly he has caught the note that catches a public who think with their boots and read with their elbows ! The cold - blooded insolence of the work almost saves it ; but he must n't go on with this . Has n't he been praised and cockered up too much ? You know these people here have no sense of proportion . They 'll call him a second Detaille and a third - hand Meissonier while his fashion lasts . It 's windy diet for a colt . '
16847	16881	16540	16540	Torpenhow	156	' I do n't think it affects Dick much . You might as well call a young wolf a lion and expect him to take the compliment in exchange for a shin - bone .

16897	16929	16698	16698	Torpenhow	156	' Now he has thrown up war work , I suppose he does n't see that the obligations of the service are just the same , only the proprietors are changed . '
16930	16944	16890	16890	He	147	' How should he know ? He thinks he is his own master . '
16945	16970	16698	16698	Torpenhow	156	' Does he ? I could undeceive him for his good , if there 's any virtue in print . He wants the whiplash . '
16971	16993	16890	16890	He	147	' Lay it on with science , then . I 'd flay him myself , but I like him too much . '
16994	17026	16698	16698	Torpenhow	156	' I 've no scruples . He had the audacity to try to cut me out with a woman at Cairo once . I forgot that , but I remember now . '

17035	17112	16698	16698	Torpenhow	156	' You 'll see when I have dealt with him . But , after all , what 's the good ? Leave him alone and he 'll come home , if he has any stuff in him , dragging or wagging his tail behind him . There 's more in a week of life than in a lively weekly . None the less I 'll slate him . I 'll slate him ponderously in the Cataclysm . '
17113	17144	16890	16890	He	147	' Good luck to you ; but I fancy nothing short of a crowbar would make Dick wince . His soul seems to have been fired before we came across him .

17205	17214	17216	17216	Torpenhow	156	' That 's exactly what Dick has done , '

26177	26190	26192	26192	Dick	147	' I could do a head of you that would startle you , '
26216	26222	26212	26212	he	147	' I am very sorry , '
26345	26375	26320	26320	Torpenhow	156	' biting self - restraint in Maisie 's presence . There was Language , and Torpenhow withdrew to consult the Nilghai , who had come in to talk continental politics .
26376	26392	26394	26395	the Nilghai	177	' Bone - idle , is he ? Careless , and touched in the temper ? '
26397	26415	26320	26320	Torpenhow	156	' It is n't worth worrying over . Dick is probably playing the fool with a woman . '
26416	26423	26394	26395	the Nilghai	177	' Is n't that bad enough ? '
26424	26489	26320	26320	Torpenhow	156	' No . She may throw him out of gear and knock his work to pieces for a while . She may even turn up here some day and make a scene on the staircase : one never knows . But until Dick speaks of his own accord you had better not touch him . He is no easy - tempered man to handle . '
26490	26513	26394	26395	the Nilghai	177	' No ; I wish he were . He is such an aggressive , cocksure , you - be - damned fellow . '
26514	26549	26320	26320	Torpenhow	156	' He 'll get that knocked out of him in time . He must learn that he ca n't storm up and down the world with a box of moist tubes and a slick brush .
26551	26556	26320	26320	Torpenhow	156	're fond of him ? '
26557	26587	26394	26395	the Nilghai	177	' I 'd take any punishment that 's in store for him if I could ; but the worst of it is , no man can save his brother . '
26588	26632	26320	26320	Torpenhow	156	' No , and the worser of it is , there is no discharge in this war . Dick must learn his lesson like the rest of us . Talking of war , there 'll be trouble in the Balkans in the spring . '
26633	26654	26394	26395	the Nilghai	177	' That trouble is long coming . I wonder if we could drag Dick out there when it comes off ? '
26670	26675	26676	26676	he	147	' Not good enough , '

26709	26743	26706	26707	the Nilghai	177	' Your vogue will be ended in less than six months , - the public will know your touch and go on to something new , - and where will you be then ? '
26744	26750	26706	26707	the Nilghai	177	' Here , in England . '
26751	26828	26706	26707	the Nilghai	177	' When you might be doing decent work among us out there ? Nonsense ! I shall go , the Keneu will be there , Torp will be there , Cassavetti will be there , and the whole lot of us will be there , and we shall have as much as ever we can do , with unlimited fighting and the chance for you of seeing things that would make the reputation of three Verestchagins . '
26829	26832	26834	26834	Dick	147	' Um ! '
26841	26925	26706	26707	the Nilghai	177	' You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your pictures ? Just think how full an average man 's life is of his own pursuits and pleasures . When twenty thousand of him find time to look up between mouthfuls and grunt something about something they are n't the least interested in , the net result is called fame , reputation , or notoriety , according to the taste and fancy of the speller my lord . '
26926	26944	26706	26707	the Nilghai	177	' I know that as well as you do . Give me credit for a little gumption . '

26953	26972	26706	26707	the Nilghai	177	' Be hanged , then ; you probably will be , - for a spy , by excited Turks .
26978	26992	26706	26707	the Nilghai	177	'm weary , dead weary , and virtue has gone out of me . '
27007	27014	27016	27017	the Nilghai	177	' That 's a bad sign , '
27045	27056	27057	27057	he	156	' We ca n't help ; we ca n't help , '

27111	27122	27085	27085	he	156	' I should . He 's a most businesslike madman . '
27130	27166	27085	27085	he	156	' Oh , here , no affection can stand this sort of thing . Wake up , Dick , and go and sleep somewhere else , if you intend to make a noise about it . '
27167	27180	27182	27183	the Nilghai	2383	' When a cat has been out on the tiles all night , '
27189	27204	27182	27183	the Nilghai	2383	' I notice that she usually sleeps all day . This is natural history . '

27306	27356	27294	27294	he	147	' it is n't safe to cross an old trail twice . Things remind one of things , and a cold wind gets up , and you feel sad ; but this is an exception to every rule that ever was . I 'll go to Maisie at once . '
27416	27426	27427	27427	he	147	' I know you 've been working too hard , '
27436	27453	27427	27427	he	147	' If you do that , you 'll break down . You had much better come . '
27454	27457	27459	27459	Maisie	146	' Where ? '
27478	27513	27427	27427	he	147	' Anywhere you please . We 'll take a train to - morrow and see where it stops . We 'll have lunch somewhere , and I 'll bring you back in the evening . '
27514	27531	27532	27532	Maisie	146	' If there 's a good working light to - morrow , I lose a day . '
27571	27614	27427	27427	he	147	' You 'll lose ever so many more , dear , if you use every hour of working light . Overwork 's only murderous idleness . Do n't be unreasonable . I 'll call for you to - morrow after breakfast early . '
27615	27625	27532	27532	Maisie	146	' But surely you are going to ask - - '
27626	27672	27427	27427	he	147	' No , I am not . I want you and nobody else . Besides , she hates me as much as I hate her . She wo n't care to come . To - morrow , then ; and pray that we get sunshine . '

27977	28002	27959	27959	she	146	' Are you quite warm enough ! Are you sure you would n't like some more breakfast ? Put the cloak over your knees . '

28166	28173	28164	28164	Dick	147	' But where are we going ? '
28174	28179	28164	28164	Dick	147	' Wait and see . '
28273	28283	28284	28284	she	146	' I wish I knew where we are going , '
28314	28322	28284	28284	she	146	' Oh , Dick , you villain ! '
28323	28350	28284	28284	she	146	' Well , I thought you might like to see the place again . You have n't been here since the old times , have you ? '
28351	28372	28284	28284	she	146	' No . I never cared to see Mrs. Jennett again ; and she was all that was ever there . '
28373	28410	28284	28284	she	146	' Not quite . Look out a minute . There 's the windmill above the potato - fields ; they have n't built villas there yet ; d'you remember when I shut you up in it ? '
28411	28428	28284	28284	she	146	' Yes . How she beat you for it ! I never told it was you . '
28429	28467	28284	28284	she	146	' She guessed . I jammed a stick under the door and told you that I was burying Amomma alive in the potatoes , and you believed me . You had a trusting nature in those days . '
28562	28575	28577	28577	Dick	147	' Suppose she should come out now , what would you do ? '
28583	28590	28577	28577	Dick	147	' I should make a face . '
28591	28596	28598	28598	Dick	147	' Show , then , '
28624	28631	28633	28633	Maisie	146	' " This is disgraceful , " '
28641	28706	28577	28577	Dick	147	' " Maisie , you run in at once , and learn the collect , gospel , and epistle for the next three Sundays . After all I 've taught you , too , and three helps every Sunday at dinner ! Dick 's always leading you into mischief . If you are n't a gentleman , Dick , you might at least - " '
28721	28730	28732	28732	Dick	147	' " Try to behave like one , " '
28736	28761	28732	28732	Dick	147	' Quite right . Now we 'll get some lunch and go on to Fort Keeling , - unless you 'd rather drive there ? '
28762	28781	28782	28782	They	981	' We must walk , out of respect to the place . How little changed it all is ! '
28829	28837	28839	28839	Maisie	146	' Dick , have you any pennies ? '
28845	28854	28870	28870	She	986	' Only three ; and if you think you 're

29033	29095	28985	28985	She	146	' Old age , dear . This it is to get fat and sleek in town . When I wished to pull your hair you generally ran for three miles , shrieking at the top of your voice . I ought to know , because those shrieks of yours were meant to call up Mrs. Jennett with a cane and - - '
29096	29111	29018	29018	she	146	' Dick , I never got you a beating on purpose in my life . '
29112	29129	28985	28985	She	146	' No , of course you never did . Good heavens ! look at the sea . '
29130	29140	29142	29142	Maisie	146	' Why , it 's the same as ever ! '
29193	29202	29204	29204	Torpenhow	156	' It 's worse than anything I imagined , '
29206	29257	29204	29204	Torpenhow	156	' Oh , the everlasting Dick , I suppose ! You fuss over him like a hen with one chick . Let him run riot if he thinks it 'll amuse him . You can whip a young pup off feather , but you ca n't whip a young man . '
29258	29276	29148	29149	Mr. Beeton	189	' It is n't a woman . It 's one woman ; and it 's a girl . '
29277	29283	29204	29204	Torpenhow	156	' Where 's your proof ? '
29284	29320	29148	29149	Mr. Beeton	189	' He got up and went out at eight this morning , - got up in the middle of the night , by Jove ! a thing he never does except when he 's on service .

29349	29377	29204	29204	Torpenhow	156	' It looks odd ; but maybe he 's decided to buy a horse at last . He might get up for that , might n't he ? '
29378	29403	29204	29204	Torpenhow	156	' Buy a blazing wheelbarrow ! He 'd have told us if there was a horse in the wind . It 's a girl . '
29404	29418	29204	29204	Torpenhow	156	' Do n't be certain . Perhaps it 's only a married woman . '
29419	29452	29204	29204	Torpenhow	156	' Dick has some sense of humour , if you have n't . Who gets up in the gray dawn to call on another man 's wife ? It 's a girl . '
29453	29477	29204	29204	Torpenhow	156	' Let it be a girl , then . She may teach him that there 's somebody else in the world besides himself . '
29478	29529	29204	29204	Torpenhow	156	' She 'll spoil his hand . She 'll waste his time , and she 'll marry him , and ruin his work for ever . He 'll be a respectable married man before we can stop him , and - he 'll ever go on the long trail again . '
29530	29590	29204	29204	Torpenhow	156	' All quite possible , but the earth wo n't spin the other way when that happens .... No ! ho ! I 'd give something to see Dick " go wooing with the boys . " Do n't worry about it . These things be with Allah , and we can only look on . Get the chessmen . '

30280	30287	30115	30115	She	146	' Is that true , dear ? '
30288	30330	30198	30198	Maisie	146	' You 've been very good to me , Dickie ; and the only way I can pay you back is by speaking the truth . I dare n't tell a fib . I despise myself quite enough as it is . '
30331	30338	30115	30115	She	146	' What in the world for ? '
30339	30376	30198	30198	Maisie	146	' Because - because I take everything that you give me and I give you nothing in return . It 's mean and selfish of me , and whenever I think of it it worries me . '
30377	30419	30115	30115	She	146	' Understand once for all , then , that I can manage my own affairs , and if I choose to do anything you are n't to blame . You have n't a single thing to reproach yourself with , darling . '
30420	30433	30198	30198	Maisie	146	' Yes , I have , and talking only makes it worse . '
30434	30442	30115	30115	She	146	' Then do n't talk about it . '

30553	30589	30491	30491	Dick	147	' Thank you . The other thing is fatal . But you must learn to forgive a man when he 's in love . He 's always a nuisance . You must have known that ? '
30608	30639	30198	30198	Maisie	146	' There were other men , of course . They always worried just when I was in the middle of my work , and wanted me to listen to them . '
30640	30645	30198	30198	Maisie	146	' Did you listen ? '
30646	30702	30198	30198	Maisie	146	' At first ; and they could n't understand why I did n't care . And they used to praise my pictures ; and I thought they meant it . I used to be proud of the praise , and tell Kami , and - I shall never forget - once Kami laughed at me . '
30703	30717	30198	30198	Maisie	146	' You do n't like being laughed at , Maisie , do you ? '

31318	31354	31084	31084	Kami	174	' Wait a minute . All we can do is to learn how to do our work , to be masters of our materials instead of servants , and never to be afraid of anything . '

If we sit down quietly to work out notions that are sent to us , we may or we may not do something that is n't bad . A great deal depends on being master of the bricks and mortar of the trade . But the instant we begin to think about success and the effect of our work - to play with one eye on the gallery - we lose power and touch and everything else . At least that 's how I have found it . Instead of being quiet and giving every power you possess to your work , you 're

And when it 's done it 's such a tiny thing , and the world 's so big , and all but a millionth part of it does n't care . Maisie , come with me and I 'll show you something of the size of the world . One can no more avoid working than eating , - that goes on by itself , - but try to see what you are working for .

When they scuffle you heave a ripe custard - apple at them , and it bursts in a lather of cream . There are hundreds of places . Come and see them . '
32150	32167	32675	32675	your	1036	' I do n't quite like that place . It sounds lazy . Tell me another . '

There are forty dead kings there , Maisie , each in a gorgeous tomb finer than all the others . You look at the palaces and streets and shops and tanks , and think that men must live there , till you find a wee gray squirrel rubbing its nose all alone in the market - place , and a jewelled peacock struts out of a carved doorway and spreads its tail against a marble screen as fine pierced as point - lace . Then a monkey - a little black monkey - walks through the main square to get a drink from a tank forty feet deep . He slides down the creepers to the water 's edge , and a friend holds him by the tail , in case he should fall in . '

32348	32613	32675	32675	your	1036	' I have been there and seen . Then evening comes , and the lights change till it 's just as though you stood in the heart of a king - opal . A little before sundown , as punctually as clockwork , a big bristly wild boar , with all his family following , trots through the city gate , churning the foam on his tusks . You climb on the shoulder of a blind black stone god and watch that pig choose himself a palace for the night and stump in wagging his tail . Then the night - wind gets up , and the sands move , and you hear the desert outside the city singing , " Now I lay me down to sleep , " and everything is dark till the moon rises . Maisie , darling , come with me and see what the world is really like . It 's very lovely , and it 's very horrible , - but I wo n't let you see anything horrid , - and it does n't care for your life or mine for pictures or anything else except doing its own work and making love . Come , and I 'll show you how to brew sangaree , and sling a hammock , and - oh , thousands of things , and you 'll see for yourself what colour means , and we 'll find out together what love means , and then , maybe , we shall be allowed to do some good work .

39254	39295	39116	39117	the Nilghai	177	' You could n't feed the Nilghai under twice the money - not though you gave him Army beef . Well , I suppose I should have found it out sooner or later . What is there to laugh at ? '

39345	39354	39344	39344	you	1137	're only a loafer it did n't matter . '
39355	39391	39344	39344	you	1137	' That 's pleasant - from the man who is bursting with my meat , too . I 'll get that dinner back one of these days . Suppose we go to a theatre now . '
39392	39406	39407	39408	The Nilghai	177	' Put our boots on , - and dress , - and wash ? '
39413	39419	39407	39408	The Nilghai	177	' I withdraw the motion . '
39420	39457	39344	39344	you	1137	' Suppose , just for a change - as a startling variety , you know - we , that is to say we , get our charcoal and our canvas and go on with our work . '
39474	39547	39407	39408	The Nilghai	177	' What a one - ideaed clucker that is ! If I had any unfinished figures on hand , I have n't any model ; if I had my model , I have n't any spray , and I never leave charcoal unfixed overnight ; and if I had my spray and twenty photographs of backgrounds , I could n't do anything to - night . I do n't feel that way . '
39548	39563	39565	39566	the Nilghai	177	' Binkie - dog , he 's a lazy hog , is n't he ? '
39568	39578	39580	39580	Dick	147	' Very good , I will do some work , '
39585	39604	39580	39580	Dick	147	' I 'll fetch the Nungapunga Book , and we 'll add another picture to the Nilghai Saga . '
39605	39616	39618	39619	the Nilghai	177	' Are n't you worrying him a little too much ? '
39628	39671	39618	39619	the Nilghai	177	' Perhaps , but I know what he can turn out if he likes . It makes me savage to hear him praised for past work when I know what he ought to do . You and I are arranged for - - '
39672	39693	39618	39619	the Nilghai	177	' By Kismet and our own powers , more 's the pity . I have dreamed of a good deal . '
39694	39707	39618	39619	the Nilghai	177	' So have I , but we know our limitations now . I 'm

39736	39759	39618	39619	the Nilghai	177	' And when all 's said and done , you will be put aside - quite rightly - for a female girl . '
39760	39775	39618	39619	the Nilghai	177	' I wonder ... Where do you think he has been to - day ? '
39776	39806	39618	39619	the Nilghai	177	' To the sea . Did n't you see the look in his eyes when he talked about her ? He 's as restless as a swallow in autumn . '
39807	39816	39618	39619	the Nilghai	177	' Yes ; but did he go alone ? '
39817	39874	39618	39619	the Nilghai	177	' I do n't know , and I do n't care , but he has the beginnings of the go - fever upon him . He wants to up - stakes and move out . There 's no mistaking the signs . Whatever he may have said before , he has the call upon him now . '
39875	39882	39618	39619	the Nilghai	177	' It might be his salvation , '
39886	39901	39883	39883	Torpenhow	156	' Perhaps - if you care to take the responsibility of being a saviour . '

40165	40178	40179	40179	he	147	' What a fortune you would have been to Blake , Nilghai ! '
40182	40220	40179	40179	he	147	' There 's a succulent pinkness about some of these sketches that 's more than life - like . " The Nilghai surrounded while bathing by the Mahdieh " - that was founded on fact , eh ? '

40243	40329	40179	40179	he	147	' No ; the Binkie - boy has n't done anything except eat and kill cats . Let 's see . Here you are as a stained - glass saint in a church . Deuced decorative lines about your anatomy ; you ought to be grateful for being handed down to posterity in this way . Fifty years hence you 'll exist in rare and curious facsimiles at ten guineas each . What shall I try this time ? The domestic life of the Nilghai ? '
40330	40336	40151	40151	He	147	' Has n't got any . '
40337	40397	40179	40179	he	147	' The undomestic life of the Nilghai , then . Of course . Mass - meeting of his wives in Trafalgar Square . That 's it . They came from the ends of the earth to attend Nilghai 's wedding to an English bride . This shall be an epic . It 's a sweet material to work with . '
40398	40407	40409	40409	Torpenhow	156	' It 's a scandalous waste of time , '
40411	40431	40432	40432	He	156	' Do n't worry ; it keeps one 's hand in - specially when you begin without the pencil . '
40438	40454	40432	40432	He	156	' That 's Nelson 's Column . Presently the Nilghai will appear shinning up it . '
40455	40463	40179	40179	he	147	' Give him some clothes this time . '
40464	40481	40432	40432	He	156	' Certainly - a veil and an orange - wreath , because he 's been married . '
40482	40490	40492	40492	Torpenhow	156	' Gad , that 's clever enough ! '
40521	40525	40526	40526	Dick	147	' Just imagine , '
40529	40563	40526	40526	Dick	147	' if we could publish a few of these dear little things every time the Nilghai subsidises a man who can write , to give the public an honest opinion of my pictures . '
40564	40612	40432	40432	He	156	' Well , you 'll admit I always tell you when I have done anything of that kind . I know I ca n't hammer you as you ought to be hammered , so I give the job to another . Young Maclagan , for instance - - '
40613	40677	40526	40526	Dick	147	' No - o - one half - minute , old man ; stick your hand out against the dark of the wall - paper - you only burble and call me names . That left shoulder 's out of drawing . I must literally throw a veil over that . Where 's my pen - knife ? Well , what about Maclagan ? '
40678	40703	40432	40432	He	156	' I only gave him his riding - orders to - to lambast you on general principles for not producing work that will last . '
40704	40710	40712	40712	Dick	147	' Whereupon that young fool , '
40731	40785	40722	40722	he	147	' being left alone with an ink - pot and what he conceived were his own notions , went and spilt them both over me in the papers . You might have engaged a grown man for the business , Nilghai . How do you think the bridal veil looks now , Torp ? '
40786	40808	40810	40810	Torpenhow	156	' How the deuce do three dabs and two scratches make the stuff stand away from the body as it does ? '
40821	40829	40722	40722	he	147	' It just depends on where you put 'em
40846	40846	40840	40840	he	211	'
40847	40864	40866	40867	the Nilghai	2383	' Why do n't you put the damned dabs into something that will stay , then ? '
40916	40945	40908	40908	he	1151	' Wait a minute till I see how I am going to manage my procession of wives . You seem to have married extensively , and I must rough 'em
40989	41026	40908	40908	he	1151	'm content with the knowledge that I 've done my best up to date , and I sha n't do anything like it again for some hours at least - probably years . Most probably never . '
41027	41040	41042	41042	Torpenhow	156	' What ! any stuff you have in stock your best work ? '
41044	41050	41052	41053	the Nilghai	177	' Anything you 've sold ? '
41055	41092	41094	41094	I	0	' Oh no . It is n't here and it is n't sold . Better than that , it ca n't be sold , and I do n't think any one knows where it is . I 'm

41122	41129	41131	41131	Torpenhow	156	' You may as well explain , '
41142	41150	41151	41151	he	0	' The sea reminded me of it , '
41155	41179	41151	41151	he	0	' I wish it had n't . It weighs some few thousand tons - unless you cut it out with a cold chisel . '
41180	41195	41197	41198	the Nilghai	177	' Do n't be an idiot . You ca n't pose with us here , '
41200	41306	41151	41151	he	0	' There 's no pose in the matter at all . It 's a fact . I was loafing from Lima to Auckland in a big , old , condemned passenger - ship turned into a cargo - boat and owned by a second - hand Italian firm . She was a crazy basket . We were cut down to fifteen ton of coal a day , and we thought ourselves lucky when we kicked seven knots an hour out of her . Then we used to stop and let the bearings cool down , and wonder whether the crack in the shaft was spreading . '
41307	41319	41151	41151	he	0	' Were you a steward or a stoker in those days ? '
41320	41347	41349	41349	Dick	147	' I was flush for the time being , so I was a passenger , or else I should have been a steward , I think , '
41363	41389	41349	41349	Dick	147	' I was the only other passenger from Lima , and the ship was half empty , and full of rats and cockroaches and scorpions . '
41390	41401	41151	41151	he	0	' But what has this to do with the picture ? '
41402	41568	41349	41349	Dick	147	' Wait a minute . She had been in the China passenger trade and her lower decks had bunks for two thousand pigtails . Those were all taken down , and she was empty up to her nose , and the lights came through the port holes - most annoying lights to work in till you got used to them . I had n't anything to do for weeks . The ship 's charts were in pieces and our skipper dare n't run south for fear of catching a storm . So he did his best to knock all the Society Islands out of the water one by one , and I went into the lower deck , and did my picture on the port side as far forward in her as I could go . There was some brown paint and some green paint that they used for the boats , and some black paint for ironwork , and that was all I had . '
41569	41578	41151	41151	he	0	' The passengers must have thought you mad . '
41579	41601	41349	41349	Dick	147	' There was only one , and it was a woman ; but it gave me the notion of my picture . '
41602	41608	41610	41610	Torpenhow	156	' What was she like ? '
41612	41677	41610	41610	Torpenhow	156	' She was a sort of Negroid - Jewess - Cuban ; with morals to match . She could n't read or write , and she did n't want to , but she used to come down and watch me paint , and the skipper did n't like it , because he was paying her passage and had to be on the bridge occasionally . '
41678	41688	41349	41349	Dick	147	' I see . That must have been cheerful . '
41689	41801	41610	41610	Torpenhow	156	' It was the best time I ever had . To begin with , we did n't know whether we should go up or go down any minute when there was a sea on ; and when it was calm it was paradise ; and the woman used to mix the paints and talk broken English , and the skipper used to steal down every few minutes to the lower deck , because he said he was afraid of fire . So , you see , we could never tell when we might be caught , and I had a splendid notion to work out in only three keys of colour . '
41802	41808	41349	41349	Dick	147	' What was the notion ? '
41809	41814	41610	41610	Torpenhow	156	' Two lines in Poe -

41943	41951	41953	41953	Torpenhow	156	' Did the woman inspire you much ? '
41955	42033	42234	42235	the Nilghai	177	' She and the sea between them - immensely . There was a heap of bad drawing in that picture . I remember I went out of my way to foreshorten for sheer delight of doing it , and I foreshortened damnably , but for all that it 's the best thing I 've ever done ; and now I suppose the ship 's broken up or gone down . Whew ! What a time that was ! '
42034	42040	42234	42235	the Nilghai	177	' What happened after all ? '
42041	42082	42234	42235	the Nilghai	177	' It all ended . They were loading her with wool when I left the ship , but even the stevedores kept the picture clear to the last . The eyes of the demons scared them , I honestly believe . '
42083	42088	42234	42235	the Nilghai	177	' And the woman ? '
42089	42148	42149	42149	He	1168	' She was scared too when it was finished . She used to cross herself before she went down to look at it . Just three colours and no chance of getting any more , and the sea outside and unlimited love - making inside , and the fear of death atop of everything else , O Lord ! '
42170	42183	42185	42186	the Nilghai	177	' Why do n't you try something of the same kind now ? '
42188	42223	42234	42235	the Nilghai	177	' Because those things come not by fasting and prayer . When I find a cargo - boat and a Jewess - Cuban and another notion and the same old life , I may . '
42224	42232	42234	42235	the Nilghai	177	' You wo n't find them here , '
42237	42244	42245	42245	Dick	147	' No , I shall not . '
42255	42272	42245	42245	Dick	147	' This room 's as hot as an oven . Open the window , some one . '

42482	42485	42487	42488	the Nilghai	177	' Well , '
42496	42505	42487	42488	the Nilghai	177	' have you never seen this place before ? '
42537	42556	42533	42533	Torpenhow	156	' Good place to bank in - bad place to bunk in , Dickie , is n't it ? '

So I went to an oculist , and he turned a gasogene - I mean a gas - engine - into my eye . That was very long ago . He said , " Scar on the head , - sword - cut and optic nerve . " Make a note of that . So I am going blind . I have some work to do before I go blind , and I suppose that I must do it . I can not see much now , but I can see best when I am drunk .

59798	59875	59784	59784	He	147	' It 's a pity , - a great pity ; but it 's helped , and it must be eaten , Master George . Sufficient unto the day is the blindness thereof , and , further , putting aside all Melancolias and false humours , it is of obvious notoriety - such as mine was - that the queen can do no wrong . Torp does n't know that . I 'll tell him when we 're
59948	60014	59947	59947	I	0	'm afflicted with ophthalmia . That was one of the ten plagues of Egypt , and it extends up the Nile in the shape of cataract . Ha ! that 's a joke , Torp . Laugh , you graven image , and stand clear of the hawser .... It 'll knock you into the water and make your dress all dirty , Maisie dear . '
60015	60018	60020	60020	Torpenhow	156	' Oh ! '

60290	60361	60288	60288	Torpenhow	156	' Dick , of all men , handing himself over like a dog ! And I was lecturing him on arrogance ! I ought to have known that it was no use to judge a man . But I did it . What a demon that girl must be ! Dick 's given her his life , - confound him ! - and she 's given him one kiss apparently . '

Another letter , and another , came from Maisie . Then there was silence , and Dick sat by the window , the pulse of summer in the air , and pictured her being won by another man , stronger than himself . His imagination , the keener for the dark background it worked against , spared him no single detail that might send him raging up and down the studio , to stumble over the stove that seemed to be in four places at once . Worst of all , tobacco would not taste in the darkness . The arrogance of the man had disappeared , and in its place were settled despair that Torpenhow knew , and blind passion that Dick confided to his pillow at night . The intervals between the paroxysms were filled with intolerable waiting and the weight of intolerable darkness .

60950	60957	60939	60939	he	156	' something will run over me . '

62247	62247	62224	62231	the Nilghai , who remembered an affair at	1510	'
62252	62271	62248	62248	Torpenhow	156	' You were more sorry when he cut you out , though . - Go on , Keneu . '
62272	62322	62179	62180	the Keneu	183	' I 've often thought , when I 've seen men die out in the desert , that if the news could be sent through the world , and the means of transport were quick enough , there would be one woman at least at each man 's bedside . '
62323	62342	62344	62345	the Nilghai	177	' There would be some mighty quaint revelations . Let us be grateful things are as they are , '
62347	62377	62179	62180	the Keneu	183	' Let us rather reverently consider whether Torp 's three - cornered ministrations are exactly what Dick needs just now . - What do you think yourself , Torp ? '
62378	62391	62179	62180	the Keneu	183	' I know they are n't . But what can I do ? '
62392	62416	62179	62180	the Keneu	183	' Lay the matter before the board . We are all Dick 's friends here . You 've been most in his life . '
62417	62430	62179	62180	the Keneu	183	' But I picked it up when he was off his head . '
62431	62450	62179	62180	the Keneu	183	' The greater chance of its being true . I thought we should arrive . Who is she ? '
62482	62501	62503	62504	the Keneu	183	' Is it possible that a man can come back across the years to his calf - love ? '
62506	62511	62503	62504	the Keneu	183	' Is it possible ? '
62512	62537	62179	62180	the Keneu	183	' I give the facts . He says nothing about it now , but he sits fumbling three letters from her when he thinks I 'm
62547	62547	62503	62504	the Keneu	183	'
62548	62553	62555	62556	the Nilghai	177	' Speak to him , '
62558	62648	62555	62556	the Nilghai	177	' Oh yes ! Write to her , - I do n't know her full name , remember , - and ask her to accept him out of pity . I believe you once told Dick you were sorry for him , Nilghai . You remember what happened , eh ? Go into the bedroom and suggest full confession and an appeal to this Maisie girl , whoever she is . I honestly believe he 'd try to kill you ; and the blindness has made him rather muscular . '
62649	62657	62659	62660	the Keneu	183	' Torpenhow 's course is perfectly clear , '
62662	62694	62659	62660	the Keneu	183	' He will go to Vitry - sur - Marne , which is on the Bezieres - Landes Railway , - single track from Tourgas . The Prussians shelled it out in '

62800	62812	62781	62781	Dick	147	' And they have four hundred and twenty pounds a year between 'em
62839	62843	62827	62827	You	1516	' said the Nilghai .
62849	62867	62844	62844	Torpenhow	156	' But it 's absurd and impossible . I ca n't drag her back by the hair . '
62868	62932	62844	62844	Torpenhow	156	' Our business - the business for which we draw our money - is to do absurd and impossible things , - generally with no reason whatever except to amuse the public . Here we have a reason . The rest does n't matter . I shall share these rooms with the Nilghai till Torpenhow returns . There will be a batch of unbridled '
62967	62977	62978	62978	we	1522	' - here the Keneu dropped his measured speech - '
63009	63009	63004	63004	Dick	147	'
63010	63037	62978	62978	we	1522	' He will , - worse luck ! I can but go and try . I ca n't conceive a woman in her senses refusing Dick . '
63038	63097	63004	63004	Dick	147	' Talk that out with the girl . I have seen you wheedle an angry Mahdieh woman into giving you dates . This wo n't be a tithe as difficult . You had better not be here to - morrow afternoon , because the Nilghai and I will be in possession . It is an order . Obey . '
63098	63101	63103	63103	Torpenhow	156	' Dick , '
63108	63116	63103	63103	Torpenhow	156	' can I do anything for you ? '
63117	63132	63004	63004	Dick	147	' No ! Leave me alone . How often must I remind you that I 'm
63135	63135	63103	63103	Torpenhow	156	'
63136	63151	63004	63004	Dick	147	' Nothing I could go for to fetch for to carry for to bring ? '
63152	63164	63103	63103	Torpenhow	156	' No . Take those infernal creaking boots of yours away . '
63165	63169	63173	63173	himself	156	' Poor chap ! '
63175	63192	63173	63173	himself	156	' I must have been sitting on his nerves lately . He wants a lighter step . '
63197	63203	63173	63173	himself	156	' Very well . Since you 're
63208	63237	63103	63103	Torpenhow	156	'm going off for four or five days . Say good - bye at least . The housekeeper will look after you , and Keneu has my rooms . '
63243	63259	63238	63238	Dick	147	' You wo n't be longer than a week at the outside ? I know I 'm

63275	63298	63333	63333	Torpenhow	156	' Ca n't you ? You 'll have to do without me in a little time , and you 'll be glad I 'm
63301	63301	63333	63333	Torpenhow	156	'
63436	63445	63446	63446	he	147	' Is it like anything in the world ? '
63450	63475	63446	63446	he	147	' Take it away . I may get the touch of the blind in fifty years . Do you know where Torpenhow has gone ? '
63481	63483	63476	63477	The Nilghai	177	' We 're
63500	63500	63526	63527	The Nilghai	177	'
63501	63516	63526	63527	The Nilghai	177	' I 'd like to be left alone , please . Do n't think I 'm
63521	63525	63526	63527	The Nilghai	177	'm best alone . '
63653	63659	63661	63661	Dick	147	' Then at the least , '
63666	63717	63661	63661	Dick	147	' she could use me as I used Binat , - for some sort of a study . I would n't ask more than to be near her again , even though I knew that another man was making love to her . Ugh ! what a dog I am ! '
63728	63771	63718	63722	A voice on the staircase	1531	' When we go - go - go away from here , Our creditors will weep and they will wail , Our absence much regretting when they find that they 've been getting Out of England by next Tuesday 's Indian mail . '
63797	63828	63793	63794	some one	1532	' And see , you good fellows , I have found a new water - bottle - firs'-class patent - eh , how you say ? Open himself inside out . '
63841	63869	63829	63829	Dick	147	' That 's Cassavetti , come back from the Continent . Now I know why Torp went away . There 's a row somewhere , and - I 'm
63874	63874	63829	63829	Dick	147	'
63882	63889	63890	63890	Dick	147	' That 's for my sake , '
63894	63931	63890	63890	Dick	147	' The birds are getting ready to fly , and they would n't tell me . I can hear Morten - Sutherland and Mackaye . Half the War Correspondents in London are there ; - and I 'm
63936	63936	63890	63890	Dick	147	'
63959	63965	63967	63967	he	147	' Where 's the trouble ? '
63969	63984	63967	63967	he	147	' In the Balkans at last ? Why did n't some one tell me ? '
63985	63994	63996	63997	the Nilghai	177	' We thought you would n't be interested , '
64001	64011	63996	63997	the Nilghai	177	' It 's in the Soudan , as usual . '
64012	64050	63996	63997	the Nilghai	177	' You lucky dogs ! Let me sit here while you talk . I sha n't be a skeleton at the feast . - Cassavetti , where are you ? Your English is as bad as ever . '
64212	64219	64221	64222	the Keneu	183	' It 's his first outing , '
64224	64234	64221	64222	the Keneu	183	' Give him some tips - about riding camels . '
64235	64241	64243	64243	Cassavetti	176	' Oh , those camels ! '
64245	64295	64243	64243	Cassavetti	176	' I shall learn to ride him again , and now I am so much all soft ! Listen , you good fellows . I know your military arrangement very well . There will go the Royal Argalshire Sutherlanders . So it was read to me upon best authority . '
64303	64307	64309	64310	the Nilghai	177	' Sit down , '
64312	64325	64309	64310	the Nilghai	177	' The lists are n't even made out in the War Office . '
64326	64335	64221	64222	the Keneu	183	' Will there be any force at Suakin ? '
64351	64513	64515	64520	the Nilghai , despairing of peace	1543	' How many Egyptian troops will they use ? - God help the Fellaheen ! - There 's a railway in Plumstead marshes doing duty as a fives - court . - We shall have the Suakin - Berber line built at last . - Canadian voyageurs are too careful . Give me a half - drunk Krooman in a whale - boat . - Who commands the Desert column ? - No , they never blew up the big rock in the Ghineh bend . We shall have to be hauled up , as usual . - Somebody tell me if there 's an Indian contingent , or I 'll break everybody 's head . - Do n't tear the map in two . - It 's a war of occupation , I tell you , to connect with the African companies in the South . - There 's Guinea - worm in most of the wells on that route . '
64537	64544	64546	64546	Dick	147	' But what becomes of Torpenhow ? '
64554	64573	64575	64576	the Nilghai	177	' Torp 's in abeyance just now . He 's off love - making somewhere , I suppose , '
64578	64589	64591	64592	the Keneu	183	' He said he was going to stay at home , '
64594	64598	64600	64600	Dick	147	' Is he ? '
64606	64612	64600	64600	Dick	147	' He wo n't . I 'm

64686	64694	64696	64697	the Keneu	183	' So do we all , Dickie , '
64699	64706	64708	64715	the new artist of the Central Southern Syndicate	1548	' And I most of all , '
64717	64724	64677	64677	I	0	' Could you tell me - - '
64725	64735	64736	64736	Dick	147	' I 'll give you one piece of advice , '
64744	64761	64736	64736	Dick	147	' If you happen to be cut over the head in a scrimmage , do n't guard .

64787	64794	64796	64797	the Nilghai	177	' There 's grit in Dick , '
64814	64844	64846	64847	the Keneu	183	' It was the sacred call of the war - trumpet . Did you notice how he answered to it ? Poor fellow ! Let 's look at him , '
64886	64890	64891	64891	he	147	' It hurts , '
64894	64929	64891	64891	he	147	' God forgive me , but it hurts cruelly ; and yet , y'know , the world has a knack of spinning round all by itself . Shall I see Torp before he goes ? '
64930	64940	64942	64943	the Nilghai	177	' Oh , yes . You 'll see him , '
64987	64994	64984	64985	Old Song	269	' MAISIE , come to bed . '
64995	65009	65010	65010	Maisie	146	' It 's so hot I ca n't sleep . Do n't worry . '
65154	65164	65165	65165	she	146	' Horrid thing ! It should be all white , '
65168	65189	65165	65165	she	146	' And the gate is n't in the middle of the wall , either . I never noticed that before . '
65390	65398	65400	65400	he	147	' Continuez , mademoiselle , continuez toujours , '
65637	65640	65642	65642	Maisie	146	' Faugh ! '
65647	65652	65654	65658	the red - haired girl	2429	' What 's that ? '
65668	65676	65678	65678	Maisie	146	' Only a conscript kissing the cook , '
65680	65687	65688	65688	She	146	' They 've gone away now . '

65976	65984	65985	65985	she	146	' It 's too hot to sleep , '
66595	66610	66616	66617	her companion	1259	' Maisie , you 'll catch a chill . Do go and lie down , '
66619	66632	66616	66617	her companion	1259	' I ca n't sleep a wink with you at the window . '
66789	66801	66768	66768	Maisie	146	' Maisie , wake up . You 'll catch a chill . '
66802	66811	66812	66812	She	146	' Yes , dear ; yes , dear . '

66971	67023	66967	66967	he	174	' But you shall remember that it is not enough to have the method , and the art , and the power , nor even that which is touch , but you shall have also the conviction that nails the work to the wall . Of the so many I taught , '
67042	67164	66967	66967	he	174	' the very so many that I have taught , the best was Binat . All that comes of the study and the work and the knowledge was to him even when he came . After he left me he should have done all that could be done with the colour , the form , and the knowledge . Only , he had not the conviction . So to - day I hear no more of Binat , - the best of my pupils , - and that is long ago . So to - day , too , you will be glad to hear no more of me . Continuez , mesdemoiselles , and , above all , with conviction . '

67335	67370	67333	67333	he	156	' It seems an absurd question to ask , but the fact is that I do n't know her by any other name : Is there any young lady here that is called Maisie ? '

67517	67542	67468	67468	Maisie	146	' Oh , no ! The Paris train does n't go through this place till to - night . There will be ample time . '
67543	67552	67468	67468	Maisie	146	' Did Mr. Heldar send you to me ? '
67553	67587	67468	67468	Maisie	146	' Certainly not . Dick would n't do that sort of thing . He 's sitting in his studio , turning over some letters that he ca n't read because he 's blind . '

68188	68232	68174	68174	He	156	' The safest thing would be to let her think things out . By Dick 's showing , - when he was off his head , - she must have ordered him about very thoroughly . Wonder how she likes being under orders . '

68984	69008	68949	68949	he	147	' Wo n't you sit down , then ? You see , I 've had some bother with my eyes , and - - '
69009	69023	68949	68949	he	147	' I know . I know . Why did n't you tell me ? '
69024	69030	68949	68949	he	147	' I could n't write . '

74530	74597	74645	74645	they	1768	're only getting on in years . Seventy - five is just possible , though . Great hell , cat O ! fifty years more of solitary confinement in the dark !

76012	76061	76072	76072	Bessie	244	'm glad to see - hear you , I mean , Bess . You never thought it worth while to turn up and see us again after you got your money . I do n't know why you should . Are you going anywhere in particular just now ? '
76062	76070	76072	76072	Bessie	244	' I was going for a walk , '

76208	76256	76204	76204	she	244	' and they 've got one of them penny - in - the - slot cash - machines , so if you get wrong by a penny at the end of the day - but then I do n't believe the machinery is right . Do you ? '
76257	76268	76204	76204	she	244	' I 've only seen it work . Mr. Beeton . '
76269	76273	76204	76204	she	244	' He 's gone .

76327	76337	76323	76323	he	147	' I can ask a policeman if it is . '
76338	76350	76297	76297	You	147	' Not at all . I come on at seven and I 'm

76470	76479	76445	76446	the girl	345	' He has gone away to the desert . '
76480	76485	76445	76446	the girl	345	' Where 's that ? '
76492	76503	76505	76505	he	147	' East - out of the mouth of the river , '
76507	76537	76445	76446	the girl	345	' Then west , then south , and then east again , all along the under - side of Europe . Then south again , God knows how far . '

76693	76707	76689	76689	her	244	' All these things have n't been looked after for months and months . '
76708	76724	76658	76658	Bessie	244	' No , only weeks , Bess . You ca n't expect them to care . '
76725	76761	76689	76689	her	244	' I do n't know what you expect them to do . They ought to know what you 've paid them for . The dust 's just awful . It 's all over the easel . '
76762	76771	76658	76658	Bessie	244	' I do n't use it much now . '
76772	76796	76689	76689	her	244	' All over the pictures and the floor , and all over your coat . I 'd like to speak to them housemaids . '

76886	76891	76867	76867	she	244	' As you are . '
76892	76918	76867	76867	she	244	' The day after you went away with the check , almost as soon as my picture was finished ; I hardly saw her alive . '
76919	76940	76867	76867	she	244	' Then they 've been cheating you ever since , that 's all . I know their nice little ways . '
76992	77002	77004	77004	Dick	147	' I do n't think Mr. Beeton cheats much , '

77129	77148	77109	77109	Bessie	244	' Put things straight . This is like unfurnished lodgings . How could you let it go so ? '
77149	77159	77109	77109	Bessie	244	' How could I help it ? Dust away . '
77194	77205	77206	77206	She	244	' Do unto others as you would be done by . '

77365	77462	77362	77362	he	1830	' Alf , you go along into the street to play . When he is n't crossed he 's as kindly as kind , but when he 's crossed he 's the devil and all . We took too many little things out of his rooms since he was blind to be that particular about what he does . They ai n't no objects to a blind man , of course , but if it was to come into court we 'd get the sack . Yes , I did introduce him to that girl because I 'm
77465	77469	77362	77362	he	1830	' man myself . '
77470	77474	77463	77466	a feelin ' man	3230	' Much too feelin '
77476	77496	77362	77362	he	1830	' Mrs. Beeton slapped the muffins into the dish , and thought of comely housemaids long since dismissed on suspicion .
77497	77607	77463	77466	a feelin ' man	3230	' I ai n't ashamed of it , and it is n't for us to judge him hard so long as he pays quiet and regular as he do . I know how to manage young gentlemen , you know how to cook for them , and what I says is , let each stick to his own business and then there wo n't be any trouble . Take them muffins down , Liza , and be sure you have no words with that young woman . His lot is cruel hard , and if he 's crossed he do swear worse than any one I 've ever served . '
77608	77615	77617	77617	Bessie	244	' That 's a little better , '
77625	77637	77617	77617	Bessie	244	' You need n't wait , thank you , Mrs. Beeton . '
77638	77652	77463	77466	a feelin ' man	3230	' I had no intention of doing such , I do assure you . '

77828	77846	77822	77822	Dick	147	' Tell us all about your bar successes , Bessie , and the way you live now . '

77912	77945	77948	77948	they	1844	' I was cut across the head a long time ago , and that ruined my eyes . I do n't suppose anybody thinks it worth while to look after me any more .

77961	77979	77903	77903	her	244	' Do n't you know any gentlemen and ladies , then , while you was - well ? '
77980	77996	77952	77953	Mr. Beeton	189	' A few , but I do n't care to have them looking at me . '
77997	78019	77903	77903	her	244	' I suppose that 's why you 've growed a beard . Take it off , it do n't become you . '
78020	78040	77952	77953	Mr. Beeton	189	' Good gracious , child , do you imagine that I think of what becomes of me these days ? '
78041	78065	77903	77903	her	244	' You ought . Get that taken off before I come here again . I suppose I can come , ca n't I ? '
78066	78098	77952	77953	Mr. Beeton	189	' I 'd be only too grateful if you did . I do n't think I treated you very well in the old days . I used to make you angry . '
78099	78106	77903	77903	her	244	' Very angry , you did . '
78107	78109	77952	77953	Mr. Beeton	189	' I 'm

78173	78236	78148	78149	Mr. Beeton	189	' They 've let you do anyhow and they have n't done anything for you . I 've only to look and see that much . I 'll come , and I 'll be glad to come , but you must go and be shaved , and you must get some other clothes - those ones are n't fit to be seen . '
78237	78243	78244	78244	he	0	' I have heaps somewhere , '
78248	78298	78148	78149	Mr. Beeton	189	' I know you have . Tell Mr. Beeton to give you a new suit and I 'll brush it and keep it clean . You may be as blind as a barn - door , Mr. Heldar , but it does n't excuse you looking like a sweep . '
78299	78309	78348	78348	she	1846	' Do I look like a sweep , then ? '
78310	78314	78148	78149	Mr. Beeton	189	' Oh , I 'm

Nobody else in the world would take the trouble , and I can make it worth her while . She 's a child of the gutter holding brevet rank as a barmaid ; so she shall have everything she wants if she 'll only come and talk and look after me . '
78829	78839	78840	78840	he	147	' I suppose I did look rather a sweep , '

Maisie came once , and that was enough for her . She was quite right . She had something to work for . This creature has only beer - handles to pull , unless she has deluded some young man into keeping company with her .
78939	78944	78938	78938	We	1855	're falling pretty low . '

79282	79299	79280	79280	he	147	' Torp took it to be balanced just before he went away . Look and see . '
79300	79312	79084	79084	she	1857	' It was generally under the tobacco - jar . Ah ! '
79313	79316	79280	79280	he	147	' Well ? '
79317	79336	79084	79084	she	1857	' Oh ! Four thousand two hundred and ten pounds nine shillings and a penny ! Oh my ! '
79337	79367	79280	79280	he	147	' You can have the penny . That 's not bad for one year 's work . Is that and a hundred and twenty pounds a year good enough ? '
79395	79443	79280	79280	he	147	' Yes ; but you 'd have to move , and if we took an inventory , I think we 'd find that Mr. Beeton has been prigging little things out of the rooms here and there . They do n't look as full as they used . '

86840	86849	86850	86850	Dick	147	' The dears - they always used to ! '
86878	86913	86695	86695	They	2026	' When I have got my mules together I go up to - night , but you must first send a telegram of Port Said , declaring that I have done you no harm . '
86914	86935	86695	86695	They	2026	' Madame has you well in hand . Would you stick a knife into me if you had the chance ? '
86936	86942	86944	86945	the Greek	2028	' I have no chance , '
86947	86955	86944	86945	the Greek	2028	' She is there with that woman . '
86956	86985	86695	86695	They	2026	' I see . It 's a bad thing to be divided between love of woman and the chance of loot . I sympathise with you , George . '
87065	87097	87052	87052	he	147	' Egyptian Government - mules . My orders are to give them over to the A. C. G. at Tanai - el - Hassan . Any occasion to show my papers ? '
87098	87125	87052	87052	he	147	' Oh , certainly not . I beg your pardon . I 'd no right to ask , but not seeing your face before I - - '
87126	87140	87142	87142	Dick	147	' I go out in the train to - night , I suppose , '
87146	87161	87142	87142	Dick	147	' There will be no difficulty in loading up the mules , will there ? '
87162	87181	87182	87184	The young man	462	' You can see the horse - platforms from here . You must have them loaded up early . '
87336	87347	87327	87327	He	147	' I say , have you got your mules ready ? '
87359	87384	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' My man 's looking after them . The - the fact is I 've a touch of ophthalmia and ca n't see very well .
87385	87421	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' By Jove ! that 's bad . You ought to lie up in hospital for a while . I 've had a turn of it myself . It 's as bad as being blind . '
87422	87435	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' So I find it . When does this armoured train go ? '
87436	87451	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' At six o'clock . It takes an hour to cover the seven miles . '
87452	87462	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' Are the Fuzzies on the rampage - eh ? '
87463	87473	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' About three nights a week . Fact is I 'm
87494	87494	87483	87483	It	2040	'
87495	87504	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' Big camp at Tanai , I suppose ? '
87505	87519	87483	87483	It	2040	' Pretty big . It has to feed our desert - column somehow . '
87520	87526	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' Is that far off ? '
87527	87540	87483	87483	It	2040	' Between thirty and forty miles - in an infernal thirsty country . '
87541	87552	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' Is the country quiet between Tanai and our men ? '
87553	87590	87483	87483	It	2040	' More or less . I should n't care to cross it alone , or with a subaltern 's command for the matter of that , but the scouts get through it in some extraordinary fashion . '
87591	87596	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' They always did . '
87597	87606	87483	87483	It	2040	' Have you been here before , then ? '
87607	87621	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' I was through most of the trouble when it first broke out . '
87622	87629	87483	87483	It	2040	' In the service and cashiered , '
87645	87662	87631	87632	the subaltern	2041	' There 's your man coming up with the mules . It seems rather queer - - '
87663	87672	87674	87674	Dick	147	' That I should be mule - leading ? '
87676	87720	87674	87674	Dick	147	' I did n't mean to say so , but it is . Forgive me - it 's beastly impertinence I know , but you speak like a man who has been at a public school . There 's no mistaking the tone . '
87721	87729	87674	87674	Dick	147	' I am a public school man . '
87730	87749	87674	87674	Dick	147	' I thought so . I say , I do n't want to hurt your feelings , but you 're
87779	87779	87776	87776	I	0	'
87780	87797	87759	87759	you	2042	' Thanks . I am about as thoroughly and completely broke as a man need be . '

87898	87939	87847	87847	I	0	' I 've been in an armoured train before . Only let me see - hear some of the fun I mean , and I 'll be grateful . I go at my own risk as a non - combatant . '
87948	87952	87953	87953	he	462	' All right , '
87956	87958	87847	87847	I	0	' We 're
87980	87980	87969	87970	no one	2414	'

88105	88118	88167	88167	another	2735	' somebody shouted , just as Dick was clamouring into the forward truck .

88169	88178	88180	88180	Dick	147	' Thanks . I 'll pay my footing , '
88210	88225	88227	88227	Dick	147	' This is an immense improvement on shooting the unimpressionable Fuzzy in the open , '
88236	88249	88251	88252	the subaltern	2041	' Oh , but he 's still unimpressed . There he goes ! '
88264	88300	88251	88252	the subaltern	2041	' We always have at least one demonstration against the night - train . Generally they attack the rear - truck , where my junior commands . He gets all the fun of the fair . '
88301	88310	88312	88312	Dick	147	' Not to - night though ! Listen ! '
88346	88357	88358	88359	the subaltern	2041	' Is it worth giving them half a hopper full ? '
88374	88403	88358	88359	the subaltern	2041	' I should think so ! This is my section of the line . They 'll be playing old Harry with my permanent way if we do n't stop 'em

88406	88410	88358	88359	the subaltern	2041	' Right O ! '
88411	88414	88425	88426	the subaltern	2041	' Hrrmph ! '
88487	88503	88472	88472	himself	147	' God is very good - I never thought I 'd hear this again . Give 'em

88623	88641	88643	88644	the subaltern	2041	' Now , you see why it takes an hour and a half to fetch her through , '
88656	88683	88685	88685	Dick	147	' It was a lark , though . I only wish it had lasted twice as long . How superb it must have looked from outside ! '
88690	88725	88726	88729	Bennil of the Gunners	2080	' It palls after the first few nights . By the way , when you 've settled about your mules , come and see what we can find to eat in my tent . I 'm

89192	89197	89199	89199	George	260	' And what now ? '
89201	89270	89179	89179	George	260	' Oh yes of course . What now ? Take me to the camel - men . Take me to where the scouts sit when they come in from the desert . They sit by their camels , and the camels eat grain out of a black blanket held up at the corners , and the men eat by their side just like camels . Take me there ! '
89387	89399	89400	89400	he	147	' Now for one last bluff - the biggest of all , '
89403	89411	89400	89400	he	147	' Peace be with you , brethren ! '
89458	89474	89476	89476	Dick	147	' A beast and a driver to go to the fighting line to - night , '
89478	89482	89489	89496	the best baggage - breed that he knew	2107	' A Mulaid ? '
89498	89502	89504	89504	Dick	147	' A Bisharin , '
89510	89528	89504	89504	Dick	147	' A Bisharin without saddle - galls . Therefore no charge of thine , shock - head . '

89578	89582	89631	89632	the sheik	2108	' How much ? '
89583	89624	89631	89632	the sheik	2108	' Twenty - five pounds English paid into the hand of the driver at my journey 's end , and as much more into the hand of the camel - sheik here , to be paid when the driver returns . '
89652	89686	89688	89688	Dick	147	' For scarcely one night 's journey - fifty pounds . Land and wells and good trees and wives to make a man content for the rest of his days . Who speaks ? '
89690	89693	89631	89632	the sheik	2108	' I , '
89698	89712	89631	89632	the sheik	2108	' I will go - but there is no going from the camp . '
89713	89768	89803	89804	the latter	487	' Fool ! I know that a camel can break his knee - halter , and the sentries do not fire if one goes in chase . Twenty - five pounds and another twenty - five pounds . But the beast must be a good Bisharin ; I will take no baggage - camel . '
89807	89834	89803	89804	the latter	487	' A little way out only . Any baggage - beast will serve . Am I a fool to waste my cattle for a blind man ? '
89835	89842	89844	89844	Dick	147	' And though I can not see '
89851	89885	89846	89846	his	147	' yet I carry that which has six eyes , and the driver will sit before me . If we do not reach the English troops in the dawn he will be dead . '
89886	89899	89846	89846	his	147	' But where , in God 's name , are the troops ? '
89900	89923	89846	89846	his	147	' Unless thou knowest let another man ride . Dost thou know ? Remember it will be life or death to thee . '

89935	89949	89930	89931	the driver	3435	' Stand back from my beast . I am going to slip him . '

90003	90028	90029	90030	The men	528	' That is well . Cut this one loose . Remember no blessing of God comes on those who try to cheat the blind . '

90099	90108	90136	90136	George	260	' Illaha ! Aho ! He is loose . '
90158	90165	90166	90166	he	260	' What 's the row now ? '
90169	90180	90181	90181	Dick	147	' Every stitch of my kit on that blasted dromedary , '
90192	90213	90181	90181	Dick	147	' Go on , and take care your throat 's not cut out side - you and your dromedary 's . '

90268	90307	90263	90263	his	147	' Go on in God 's name , and swiftly . Good - bye , George . Remember me to Madame , and have a good time with your girl . Get forward , child of the Pit ! '

90722	90732	90757	90757	Dick	147	' Go on . The night is very cold . '
90931	90937	90938	90938	he	147	' I smell the dawn , '
90941	90957	90938	90938	he	147	' It is here , and yonder are the troops . Have I done well ? '
90980	90993	90916	90917	The driver	3435	' Go on . We must get there swiftly . Go on . '
90994	91016	90916	90917	The driver	3435	' They are moving in their camp . There is so much dust that I can not see what they do . '

91065	91080	91081	91081	Dick	147	' Is that at us ? Surely they can see that I am English , '
91085	91094	91095	91096	the driver	3435	' Nay , it is from the desert , '
91104	91125	91095	91096	the driver	3435	' Go forward , my child ! Well it is that the dawn did not uncover us an hour ago . '
