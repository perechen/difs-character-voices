204	400	403	403	you	242	' hall to prognostications of a possible night attack , that the robbers had come at last most awfully . A crowd of maids gathered along the upper corridor of the main body of the building : two or three footmen hung lower down , bold in attitude . Suddenly the noise ended , and soon after the voice of old Sewis commanded them to scatter away to their beds ; whereupon the footmen took agile leaps to the post of danger , while the women , in whose bosoms intense curiosity now supplanted terror , proceeded to a vacant room overlooking the front entrance , and spied from the window . Meanwhile Sewis stood by his master 's bedside . The squire was a hunter , of the old sort : a hard rider , deep drinker , and heavy slumberer . Before venturing to shake his arm Sewis struck a light and flashed it over the squire 's eyelids to make the task of rousing him easier . At the first touch the squire sprang up , swearing by his Lord Harry he had just dreamed of fire , and muttering of buckets . '
404	417	403	403	you	242	're the man , are you : where has it broken out ? '
418	426	428	428	Sewis	242	' No , sir ; no fire , '
430	437	403	403	you	242	' you be cool , sir . '
438	501	502	503	The squire	756	' Cool , sir ! confound it , Sewis , have n't I heard a whole town of steeples at work ? I do n't sleep so thick but I can hear , you dog ! Fellow comes here , gives me a start , tells me to be cool ; what the deuce ! nobody hurt , then ? all right ! '
520	539	516	516	Sewis	242	' There 's a gentleman downstairs ; a gentleman downstairs , sir . He has come rather late . '
540	547	548	549	The squire	756	' Gentleman downstairs come rather late . '
558	586	587	587	Sewis	242	' Rather late , eh ? Oh ! Shove him into a bed , and give him hot brandy and water , and be hanged to him ! '
604	628	601	601	He	242	' The gentleman does n't talk of staying . That is not his business . It 's rather late for him to arrive . '
629	633	635	636	the squire	756	' Rather late ! '
638	646	635	636	the squire	756	' Why , what 's it o'clock ? '

836	858	749	749	deuce	775	' Sewis withdrew a step from the bedside . At a safe distance he fronted his master steadily ; almost admonishingly . '

873	890	891	892	The scoundrel	779	' The squire checked his breath . That was a name never uttered at the Grange . '
894	941	891	892	The scoundrel	779	' he inquired harshly , half in a tone of one assuring himself , and his rigid dropped jaw shut . The fact had to be denied or affirmed instantly , and Sewis was silent . Grasping his bedclothes in a lump , the squire cried : '
956	957	948	948	You	242	' '
962	963	964	964	You	242	' '

1049	1086	1040	1040	sir	7975	' By this time the midnight visitor 's patience had become exhausted . A renewal of his clamour for immediate attention fell on the squire 's ear , amazing him to stupefaction at such challengeing insolence . '
1092	1098	1099	1099	I	0	' he called to Sewis ; '
1109	1206	1099	1099	I	0	' Sewis held the garment ready . The squire jumped from the bed , fuming speechlessly , chafing at gaiters and braces , cravat and coat , and allowed his buttons to be fitted neatly on his calves ; the hammering at the hall - door and plucking at the bell going on without intermission . He wore the aspect of one who assumes a forced composure under the infliction of outrages on his character in a Court of Law , where he must of necessity listen and lock his boiling replies within his indignant bosom .

1277	1359	1260	1260	I	0	' said Sewis . The squire was diverted from his objurgations against this piece of servitorial defiance by his daughter Dorothy 's timid appeal for permission to come in . Sewis left the room . Presently the squire descended , fully clad , and breathing sharply from his nostrils . Servants were warned off out of hearing ; none but Sewis stood by . The squire himself unbolted the door , and threw it open to the limit of the chain . '
1364	1375	1376	1376	I	0	' he demanded . A response followed promptly from outside : '

He was acting under strong control of his temper . It was a quiet grey night , and as the doors flew open , a largely - built man , dressed in a high - collared great - coat and fashionable hat of the time , stood clearly defined to view . He carried a light cane , with the point of the silver handle against his under lip . There was nothing formidable in his appearance , and his manner was affectedly affable . He lifted his hat as soon as he found himself face to face with the squire , disclosing a partially bald head , though his whiskering was luxuriant , and a robust condition of manhood was indicated by his erect attitude and the immense swell of his furred great - coat at the chest . His features were exceedingly frank and cheerful . From his superior height , he was enabled to look down quite royally on the man whose repose he had disturbed . The following conversation passed between them . '

Mr. Beltham , I request you , for the final time , to accord me your promise observe , I accept your promise that I shall , at my demand , to - morrow or the next day , obtain an interview with my wife .

4761	5070	5071	5072	Harry Richmond	244	' The door slammed violently on such further speech as he had in him to utter . He seemed at first astonished ; but finding the terrified boy about to sob , he drew a pretty box from one of his pockets and thrust a delicious sweetmeat between the whimpering lips . Then , after some moments of irresolution , during which he struck his chest soundingly and gazed down , talked alternately to himself and the boy , and cast his eyes along the windows of the house , he at last dropped on one knee and swaddled the boy in the folds of the shawl . Raising him in a business - like way , he settled him on an arm and stepped briskly across gravel - walk and lawn , like a horse to whose neck a smart touch of the whip has been applied . The soft mild night had a moon behind it somewhere ; and here and there a light - blue space of sky showed small rayless stars ; the breeze smelt fresh of roots and heath . It was more a May - night than one of February . So strange an aspect had all these quiet hill - lines and larch and fir - tree tops in the half - dark stillness , that the boy 's terrors were overlaid and almost subdued by his wonderment ; he had never before been out in the night , and he must have feared to cry in it , for his sobs were not loud . On a rise of the park - road where a fir - plantation began , he heard his name called faintly from the house by a woman 's voice that he knew to be his aunt Dorothy 's . It came after him only once : '
5073	5229	5071	5072	Harry Richmond	244	' ; but he was soon out of hearing , beyond the park , among the hollows that run dipping for miles beside the great highroad toward London . Sometimes his father whistled to him , or held him high and nodded a salutation to him , as though they had just discovered one another ; and his perpetual accessibility to the influences of spicy sugarplums , notwithstanding his grief , caused his father to prognosticate hopefully of his future wisdom . So , when obedient to command he had given his father a kiss , the boy fell asleep on his shoulder , ceasing to know that he was a wandering infant : and , if I remember rightly , he dreamed he was in a ship of cinnamon - wood upon a sea that rolled mighty , but smooth immense broad waves , and tore thing from thing without a sound or a hurt .

7553	7668	7524	7524	she	268	' We waited a number of days , until Mrs. Waddy received a letter from him . She came full - dressed into my room , requesting me to give her twenty kisses for papa , and I looked on while she arranged her blue bonnet at the glass . The bonnet would not fix in its place . At last she sank down crying in a chair , and was all brown silk , and said that how to appear before a parcel of dreadful men , and perhaps a live duke into the bargain , was more than she knew , and more than could be expected of a lone widow woman . '
7673	7725	7524	7524	she	268	' she answered my petition to accompany her . She would not , she said , have me go to my papa there for anything on earth ; my papa would perish at the sight of me ; I was not even to wish to go . And then she exclaimed , '
7735	8344	7524	7524	she	268	' and that people were cruel to him , and would never take into account his lovely temper , and that everybody was his enemy , when he ought to be sitting with the highest in the land . I had realized the extremity of my forlorn state on a Sunday that passed empty of my father , which felt like his having gone for ever . My nursemaid came in to assist in settling Mrs. Waddy 's bonnet above the six crisp curls , and while they were about it I sat quiet , plucking now and then at the brown silk , partly to beg to go with it , partly in jealousy and love at the thought of its seeing him from whom I was so awfully separated . Mrs. Waddy took fresh kisses off my lips , assuring me that my father would have them in twenty minutes , and I was to sit and count the time . My nursemaid let her out . I pretended to be absorbed in counting , till I saw Mrs. Waddy pass by the window . My heart gave a leap of pain . I found the street - door open and no one in the passage , and I ran out , thinking that Mrs. Waddy would be obliged to take me if she discovered me by her side in the street . I was by no means disconcerted at not seeing her immediately . Running on from one street to another , I took the turnings with unhesitating boldness , as if I had a destination in view . I must have been out near an hour before I understood that Mrs. Waddy had eluded me ; so I resolved to enjoy the shop - windows with the luxurious freedom of one whose speculations on those glorious things all up for show are no longer distracted by the run of time and a nursemaid . Little more than a glance was enough , now that I knew I could stay as long as I liked . If I stopped at all , it was rather to exhibit the bravado of liberty than to distinguish any particular shop with my preference : all were equally beautiful ; so were the carriages ; so were the people . Ladies frequently turned to look at me , perhaps because I had no covering on my head ; but they did not interest me in the least . I should have been willing to ask them or any one where the Peerage lived , only my mind was quite full , and I did not care . I felt sure that a great deal of walking would ultimately bring me to St. Paul 's or Westminster Abbey ; to anything else I was indifferent . Toward sunset my frame was struck as with an arrow by the sensations of hunger on passing a cook's - shop . I faltered along , hoping to reach a second one , without knowing why I had dragged my limbs from the first . There was a boy in ragged breeches , no taller than myself , standing tiptoe by the window of a very large and brilliant pastry - cook 's . He persuaded me to go into the shop and ask for a cake . I thought it perfectly natural to do so , being hungry ; but when I reached the counter and felt the size of the shop , I was abashed , and had to repeat the nature of my petition twice to the young woman presiding there . '
8353	8357	7524	7524	she	268	' she said . '

8375	8395	8358	8358	We	1040	' said I , pursuing my request . Another young woman came , laughing and shaking lots of ringlets . '
8412	8425	8407	8407	he	1039	' she remarked , and handed me a stale bun , saying , '
8439	8440	8437	8437	you	1038	' '
8454	8468	8448	8448	I	0	' I replied . I heard her say , as I went out , '
8479	8488	8489	8489	Gemini	270	' The ragged boy was awaiting me eagerly . '
8492	8497	8498	8498	he	1039	're a lucky one , '
8501	8511	8498	8498	he	1039	' here , come along , curly - poll . '
8674	8701	8669	8669	he	1046	' Why had I no hat on in the open street ? Where did my mother live ? What was I doing out alone in London ? '
8766	8772	8773	8773	He	1046	' I am so hungry . '
8778	8817	8773	8773	He	1046	' It 's no use cross - examining an empty stomach . You 'll do me the favour to dine with me , my little man . We 'll talk over your affairs by - and - by . '
9056	9066	9072	9072	he	1056	' Do you know what you are , sir ? '
9080	9082	9072	9072	he	1056	' you 're
9087	9125	9072	9072	he	1056	' I felt interested in him , and asked him what he was . He informed me that he was a lawyer , and ready to be pantaloon to my clown , if I would engage him . '
9132	9135	9072	9072	he	1056	' said I. '
9139	9143	9072	9072	he	1056	' he replied . '
9148	9152	9153	9153	I	0	' said I , '
9159	9167	9153	9153	I	0	' The young lady screamed with laughter . '
9180	9208	9153	9153	I	0	' she said , and coming round to me , lifted me out of my chair , and wanted to know if I knew how to kiss . '
9219	9232	9213	9213	I	0	' said I , giving the salute without waiting for the invitation ; '
9235	9239	9240	9240	I	0	' I added , '
9248	9309	9240	9240	I	0	' She was indignant , and told me she was going to be offended , so I let her understand that I liked being kissed and played with in the morning before I was up , and if she would come to my house ever so early , she would find me lying next the wall and ready for her . '
9315	9319	9240	9240	I	0	' she asked . '
9325	9455	9322	9323	my papa	8112	' I was beginning to say , but broke the words with a sob , for I seemed to be separated from him now by the sea itself . They petted me tenderly . My story was extracted by alternate leading questions from the old gentleman and timely caresses from the ladies . I could tell them everything except the name of the street where I lived . My midnight excursion from the house of my grandfather excited them chiefly ; also my having a mother alive who perpetually fanned her face and wore a ball - dress and a wreath ; things that I remembered of my mother . The ladies observed that it was clear I was a romantic child . I noticed that the old gentleman said '
9458	9725	9726	9726	I	0	' very often , and his eyebrows were like a rook 's nest in a tree when I spoke of my father walking away with Shylock 's descendant and not since returning to me . A big book was fetched out of his library , in which he read my grandfather 's name . I heard him mention it aloud . I had been placed on a stool beside a tea - tray near the fire , and there I saw the old red house of Riversley , and my mother dressed in white , and my aunt Dorothy ; and they all complained that I had ceased to love them , and must go to bed , to which I had no objection . Somebody carried me up and undressed me , and promised me a great game of kissing in the morning . The next day in the strange house I heard that the old gentleman had sent one of his clerks down to my grandfather at Riversley , and communicated with the constables in London ; and , by - and - by , Mrs. Waddy arrived , having likewise visited those authorities , one of whom supported her claims upon me . But the old gentleman wished to keep me until his messenger returned from Riversley . He made all sorts of pretexts . In the end , he insisted on seeing my father , and Mrs. Waddy , after much hesitation , and even weeping , furnished the address : upon hearing which , spoken aside to him , he said , '
9730	9812	9726	9726	I	0	' Mrs. Waddy entreated him to be respectful to my father , who was , she declared , his superior , and , begging everybody 's pardon present , the superior of us all , through no sin of his own , that caused him to be so unfortunate ; and a real Christian and pattern , in spite of outsides , though as true a gentleman as ever walked , and by rights should be amongst the highest . She repeated '
9816	10087	9322	9323	my papa	8112	' reprovingly , with the ears of barley in her blue bonnet shaking , and her hands clasped tight in her lap . Old Mr. Bannerbridge that was the old gentleman 's name came back very late from his visit to my father , so late that he said it would be cruel to let me go out in the street after my bed - time . Mrs. Waddy consented to my remaining , on the condition of my being surrendered to her at nine o'clock , and no later , the following morning . I was assured by Mr. Bannerbridge that my father 's health and appetite were excellent ; he gave me a number of unsatisfying messages , all the rest concerning his interview he whispered to his daughter and his sister , Miss Bannerbridge , who said they hoped they would have news from Hampshire very early , so that the poor child might be taken away by the friends of his infancy . I could understand that my father was disapproved of by them , and that I was a kind of shuttlecock flying between two battledores ; but why they pitied me I could not understand . There was a great battle about me when Mrs. Waddy appeared punctual to her appointed hour . The victory was hers , and I , her prize , passed a whole day in different conveyances , the last of which landed us miles away from London , at the gates of an old drooping , mossed and streaked farmhouse , that was like a wall - flower in colour .
10232	10256	10257	10258	The women	1071	' How long am I to stay here ? Am I going away tomorrow ? What 's going to be done with me ? '
10304	10375	10299	10300	Mrs. Waddy	268	' Here , Master Harry , your own papa will come for you ; and you may be sure he will , for I have his word he will , and he 's not one to break it , unless his country 's against him ; and for his darling boy he 'd march against cannons . So here you 'll sit and wait for him , wo n't you ? '
10424	10432	10433	10434	Mrs. Waddy	268	' Where his heart 's not concerned , '
10440	10449	10433	10434	Mrs. Waddy	268	' he 's shrewd as a little schoolmaster . '
10450	10458	10460	10461	Mrs. Thresher	275	' He've a bird's - nesting eye , '
10498	10524	10525	10526	Mrs. Waddy	268	' More than his eating and his drinking , that child 's father worrits about his learning to speak the language of a British gentleman , '
10529	10566	10525	10526	Mrs. Waddy	268	' Before that child your h 's must be like the panting of an engine to please his father . He 'd stop me carrying the dinner - tray on meat - dish hot , and I 'm
10695	10700	10713	10714	John Thresher	276	're about to speak . '
10701	10711	10713	10714	John Thresher	276	' Change loads on the road , you mean , '
10716	10751	10713	10714	John Thresher	276	' Na , na , he 's come to settle nigh a weedy field , if you like , but his crop ai n't nigh reaping yet . Hark you , Mary Waddy , who 're
10811	10814	10802	10803	Mrs. Waddy	268	' True ! '
10815	10825	10802	10803	Mrs. Waddy	268	' Drink or no , that 's the trick o '
10828	10846	10802	10803	Mrs. Waddy	268	' he added . They assented . They began praising him , too , like meek creatures . '
10889	10890	10878	10878	you	277	' '
10915	10916	10899	10899	Martha	274	' '
10919	10925	10899	10899	Martha	274	'm no scholar , and you 're
10929	10963	10899	10899	Martha	274	' said John . Mrs. Waddy put her mouth to his ear . Up went his eyebrows , wrinkling arches over a petrified stare . In some way she had regained her advantage . '
10969	10973	10899	10899	Martha	274	' he inquired . '
10987	11483	11484	11484	I	0	' she replied , bowing . John Thresher poised me in the very centre of his gaze . He declared he would never have guessed that , and was reproved , inasmuch as he might have guessed it . He then said that I could not associate with any of the children thereabout , and my dwelling in the kitchen was not to be thought of . The idea of my dwelling in the kitchen seemed to be a serious consideration with Mrs. Martha likewise . I was led into the rooms of state . The sight of them was enough . I stamped my feet for the kitchen , and rarely in my life have been happier than there , dining and supping with John and Martha and the farm - labourers , expecting my father across the hills , and yet satisfied with the sun . To hope , and not be impatient , is really to believe , and this was my feeling in my father 's absence . I knew he would come , without wishing to hurry him . He had the world beyond the hills ; I this one , where a slow full river flowed from the sounding mill under our garden wall , through long meadows . In Winter the wild ducks made letters of the alphabet flying . On the other side of the copses bounding our home , there was a park containing trees old as the History of England , John Thresher said , and the thought of their venerable age enclosed me comfortably . He could not tell me whether he meant as old as the book of English History ; he fancied he did , for the furrow - track follows the plough close upon ; but no one exactly could swear when that the book was put together . At my suggestion , he fixed the trees to the date of the Heptarchy , a period of heavy ploughing . Thus begirt by Saxon times , I regarded Riversley as a place of extreme baldness , a Greenland , untrodden by my Alfred and my Harold . These heroes lived in the circle of Dipwell , confidently awaiting the arrival of my father . He sent me once a glorious letter . Mrs. Waddy took one of John Thresher 's pigeons to London , and in the evening we beheld the bird cut the sky like an arrow , bringing round his neck a letter warm from him I loved . Planet communicating with planet would be not more wonderful to men than words of his to me , travelling in such a manner . I went to sleep , and awoke imagining the bird bursting out of heaven . Meanwhile there was an attempt to set me moving again . A strange young man was noticed in the neighbourhood of the farm , and he accosted me at Leckham fair . '
11516	11564	11509	11509	I	0	' Not unwilling to hear him , I took his hand , leaving my companion , the miller 's little girl , Mabel Sweetwinter , at a toy - stand , while Bob , her brother and our guardian , was shying sticks in a fine attitude . '
11573	11579	11568	11569	your father	1098	' said the young man ; '
11590	11673	11568	11569	your father	1098	' I showed him how fast . We were pursued by Bob , who fought for me , and won me , and my allegiance instantly returned to him . He carried me almost the whole of the way back to Dipwell . Women must feel for the lucky heroes who win them , something of what I felt for mine ; I kissed his bloody face , refusing to let him wipe it . John Thresher said to me at night , '
11705	11721	11687	11687	you	1099	' first - rate pastime under foot ? I speak truth , and my word for '
11757	11878	11755	11755	Bob	281	' He assured me , and he had my entire faith , that boxing was England 's natural protection from the foe . The comfort of having one like Bob to defend our country from invasion struck me as inexpressible . Lighted by John Thresher 's burning patriotism , I entered the book of the History of England at about the pace of a carthorse , with a huge waggon at my heels in the shape of John . There was no moving on until he was filled . His process of receiving historical knowledge was to fight over again the personages who did injury to our honour as a nation , then shake hands and be proud of them . '
11887	11890	11891	11891	he	1104	're cunning , '
11894	11975	11891	11891	he	1104	' and we not being able to get rid of William the Conqueror , because he 's got a will of his own and he wo n't budge , why , we takes and makes him one of ourselves ; and no disgrace in that , I should hope ! He paid us a compliment , do n't you see , Master Harry ? he wanted to be an Englishman . " Can you this ? " says we , sparrin '
11983	12007	11891	11891	he	1104	' , " says he , " and does it well . " " Well then , " says we , " then you 're
12024	12114	12135	12135	he	1108	' John Thresher had a laborious mind ; it cost him beads on his forehead to mount to these heights of meditation . He told me once that he thought one 's country was like one 's wife : you were born in the first , and married to the second , and had to learn all about them afterwards , ay , and make the best of them . He recommended me to mix , strain , and throw away the sediment , for that was the trick o '
12304	12324	12325	12325	she	268	' The child 's papa would strip him if he saw him in a country tailor 's funeral suit , '
12660	12698	12653	12653	he	925	' Sweetwinter , I thank you for your attention to my son ; and you , Thribble ; and you , my man ; and you , Baker ; Rippengale , and you ; and you , Jupp '
12854	12915	12834	12834	he	925	' Yes , my son , we will return to them tenfold what they have done for you . The eleventh day of May shall be a day of pleasure for Dipwell while I last , and you will keep it in memory of me when I am gone . And now to see the bed you have slept in . '
12938	12941	12943	12943	he	925	' Ha ! '
12954	12967	12943	12943	he	925	' madam , I am your life - long debtor and friend ! '
12980	12991	12975	12976	John Thresher	276	' Why , dame , you trembles like a maid . '
13039	13044	13046	13047	my father	925	' A royal salvo ! '
13472	13526	13471	13471	boys	1177	' history books . All the servants were drawn up in the hall to do homage to me . They seemed less real and living than the wonder of the sweet - smelling chairs , the birds , and the elegant dogs . Richest of treats , a monkey was introduced to me . '
13534	13541	13542	13542	he	8067	' Mrs. Waddy said , resignedly ; '
13558	13590	13542	13542	he	8067	' Yet she smiled happily , though her voice was melancholy . From her I now learnt that my name was Richmond Roy , and not Harry Richmond . I said , '
13594	13644	13542	13542	he	8067	' for I was used to change . Everybody in the house wore a happy expression of countenance , except the monkey , who was too busy . As we mounted the stairs I saw more kings of England painted on the back - windows . Mrs. Waddy said : '
13654	13666	13542	13542	he	8067	' she coughed modestly after the long word , and pursued : '
13671	13728	13732	13734	all the kings	1180	' I insisted upon going to the top floor , where I expected to find William the Conqueror , and found him ; but that strong connecting link between John Thresher and me presented himself only to carry my recollections of the Dipwell of yesterday as far back into the past as the old Norman days . '
13738	13746	13732	13734	all the kings	1180	' I said , surveying them consecutively . '
13749	13767	13732	13734	all the kings	1180	' she replied , in a tone that might lead one to think it their lamentable fate . '
13786	13789	13783	13784	Master Richmond	244	' I said '
13792	13920	13783	13784	Master Richmond	244	' in turn ; and then we left off answering , but questioned one another , which is a quicker way of getting at facts ; I know it is with boys and women . Mrs. Waddy cared much less to hear of Dipwell and its inhabitants than of the sensation created everywhere by our equipage . I noticed that when her voice was not melancholy her face was . She showed me a beautiful little pink bed , having a crown over it , in a room opening to my father 's . Twenty thousand magnificent dreams seemed to flash their golden doors when I knew that the bed was mine . I thought it almost as nice as a place by my father 's side . '
13930	13939	13927	13928	Mrs. Waddy	268	' I said . She smiled and sighed . '
13964	14088	14089	14089	They	1187	' She simpered and looked sad . I had too many distractions , or I should have asked her whether my amazing and delightful new home had ever shown symptoms of vanishing ; it appeared to me , judging from my experience , that nothing moved violently except myself , and my principal concern was lest any one should carry me away at a moment 's notice . In the evening I was introduced to a company of gentlemen , who were drinking wine after dinner with my father . They clapped their hands and laughed immoderately on my telling them that I thought those kings of England who could not find room on the windows must have gone down to the cellars . '
14093	14109	14089	14089	They	1187	' my father said . He drank off a glassful of wine and sighed prodigiously . '
14148	14323	14143	14146	Richmond Roy the younger	243	' They drank to me heartily , but my father had fallen mournful before I left the room . Pony - riding , and lessons in boxing and wrestling , and lessons in French from a French governess , at whose appearance my father always seemed to be beginning to dance a minuet , so exuberantly courteous was he ; and lessons in Latin from a tutor , whom my father invited to dinner once a fortnight , but did not distinguish otherwise than occasionally to take down Latin sentences in a notebook from his dictation , occupied my mornings . My father told the man who instructed me in the art of self - defence that our family had always patronized his profession . I wrestled ten minutes every day with this man 's son , and was regularly thrown . On fine afternoons I was dressed in black velvet for a drive in the park , where my father uncovered his head to numbers of people , and was much looked at . '
14352	14441	14350	14350	Richie	448	' he said . We used to go to his opera - box ; and we visited the House of Lords and the House of Commons ; and my father , though he complained of the decay of British eloquence , and mourned for the days of Chatham , and William Pitt our old friend of the cake and the raspberry jam , and Burke , and Sheridan , encouraged the orators with approving murmurs . My father no longer laid stress on my studies of the Peerage . '
14457	14825	14443	14443	I	0	' he said . I wished to know whether I was likely to be transported suddenly to some other place . He assured me that nothing save a convulsion of the earth would do it , which comforted me , for I took the firmness of the earth in perfect trust . We spoke of our old Sunday walks to St. Paul 's and Westminster Abbey as of a day that had its charm . Our pew among a fashionable congregation pleased him better . The pew - opener curtseyed to none as she did to him . For my part , I missed the monuments and the chants , and something besides that had gone I knew not what . At the first indication of gloom in me , my father became alarmed , and , after making me stand with my tongue out before himself and Mrs. Waddy , like a dragon in a piece of tapestry , would resume his old playfulness , and try to be the same that he had been in Mrs. Waddy 's lodgings . Then we read the Arabian Nights together , or , rather , he read them to me , often acting out the incidents as we rode or drove abroad . An omission to perform a duty was the fatal forgetfulness to sprinkle pepper on the cream - tarts ; if my father subjected me to an interrogation concerning my lessons , he was the dread African magician to whom must be surrendered my acquisition of the ring and the musty old lamp . We were quite in the habit of meeting fair Persians . He would frequently ejaculate that he resembled the Three Calendars in more respects than one . To divert me during my recovery from measles , he one day hired an actor in a theatre , and put a cloth round his neck , and seated him in a chair , rubbed his chin with soap , and played the part of the Barber over him , and I have never laughed so much in my life . Poor Mrs. Waddy got her hands at her sides , and kept on gasping , '
14832	15395	14443	14443	I	0	' while the Barber hurried away from the half - shaved young man to consult his pretended astrolabe in the next room , where we heard him shouting the sun 's altitude , and consulting its willingness for the impatient young man to be further shaved ; and back he came , seeming refreshed to have learnt the sun 's favourable opinion , and gabbling at an immense rate , full of barber 's business . The servants were allowed to be spectators ; but as soon as the young man was shaved , my father dismissed them with the tone of a master . No wonder they loved him . Mrs. Waddy asked who could help it ? I remember a pang I had when she spoke of his exposure to the risk of marrying again ; it added a curious romantic tenderness to my adoration of him , and made me feel that he and I stood against the world . To have his hand in mine was my delight . Then it was that I could think earnestly of Prince Ahmed and the kind and beautiful Peribanou , whom I would not have minded his marrying . My favourite dream was to see him shooting an arrow in a match for a prize , and losing the prize because of not finding his arrow , and wondering where the arrow had flown to , and wandering after it till he passed out of green fields to grassy rocks , and to a stony desert , where at last he found his arrow at an enormous distance from the shooting line , and there was the desert all about him , and the sweetest fairy ever imagined going to show herself to him in the ground under his feet . In his absence I really hungered for him , and was jealous . During this Arabian life , we sat on a carpet that flew to the Continent , where I fell sick , and was cured by smelling at an apple ; and my father directed our movements through the aid of a telescope , which told us the titles of the hotels ready to receive us . As for the cities and cathedrals , the hot meadows under mountains , the rivers and the castles - they were little more to me than an animated book of geography , opening and shutting at random ; and travelling from place to place must have seemed to me so much like the life I had led , that I was generally as quick to cry as to laugh , and was never at peace between any two emotions . By - and - by I lay in a gondola with a young lady . My father made friends fast on our travels : her parents were among the number , and she fell in love with me and enjoyed having the name of Peribanou , which I bestowed on her for her delicious talk of the blue and red - striped posts that would spout up fountains of pearls if they were plucked from their beds , and the palaces that had flown out of the farthest corners of the world , and the city that would some night or other vanish suddenly , leaving bare sea - ripple to say '
15400	15497	14443	14443	I	0	' as they rolled over . I would have seen her marry my father happily . She was like rest and dreams to me , soft sea and pearls . We entered into an arrangement to correspond for life . Her name was Clara Goodwin ; she requested me to go always to the Horse Guards to discover in what part of the world Colonel Goodwin might be serving when I wanted to write to her . I , in return , could give no permanent address , so I related my history from the beginning . '
15512	15623	14443	14443	I	0	' she said ; and insisted that I should drop the odious name of Roy when I grew a man . My father quarrelled with Colonel Goodwin . Months after I felt as if I had only just been torn from Clara , but she stood in a mist , irrecoverably distant . I had no other friend . Twelve dozen of splendid Burgundy were the fruit of our tour , to be laid down at Dipwell farm for my arrival at my majority , when I should be a legal man , embarked in my own ship , as my father said . I did not taste the wine . '
15633	15674	14443	14443	I	0	' cried Mrs. Waddy , who did . My father eyed her with pity , and ordered her to send the wine down to Dipwell , which was done . He took me between his knees , and said impressively , '
15721	15733	15734	15734	his	0	'm gone , Richie , shut up in the long box , '
15742	15816	15739	15739	he	0	' gone to Peribanou underneath , you know , remember that your dada saw that the wine was a good vintage , and bought it and had it bottled in his own presence while you were asleep in the Emperor 's room in the fine old Burgundy city , and swore that , whatever came to them both , his son should drink the wine of princes on the day of his majority . '
15936	15949	15950	15950	she	268	' Lord only knows where we shall all be by that time ! '
15953	15960	15966	15966	They	1211	' She is a dewy woman , '
16016	16025	16002	16002	She	268	' No matter ; our clock strikes soon ! '
16097	16110	16111	16111	he	925	' And now , ma'am , you have occupation for your mind , '
16356	16371	16373	16373	he	925	' We will try the scarlet livery on one of our drives , Richie , '
16380	16387	16388	16388	she	268	' It is unlawful , sir , '
16391	16397	16388	16388	she	268	' For whom , ma'am ? '

The sins of Mrs. Waddy were forgiven her , owing to her noble resistance to the legal gentleman 's seductive speech . So I walked up and down stairs with the kings of England looking at me out of the coloured windows quietly for a week ; and then two ugly men entered the house , causing me to suffer a fearful oppression , though my father was exceedingly kind to them and had beds provided for them , saying that they were very old retainers of his . But the next day our scarlet livery appeared . After exacting particular attention to his commands , my father quitted Mrs. Waddy , and we mounted the carriage , laughing at her deplorable eyes and prim lips , which he imitated for my amusement . '
17600	17639	17427	17427	We	1265	' he remarked . He asked me if splendour did not fatigue me also . I caught the answer from his face and replied that it did , and that I should like to go right on to Dipwell '
17646	17970	17427	17427	We	1265	' said my father , and thought over it . We had an extraordinary day . People stood fast to gaze at us ; in the country some pulled off their hats and set up a cheer . The landlords of the inns where we baited remained bare - headed until we started afresh , and I , according to my father 's example , bowed and lifted my cap gravely to persons saluting us along the roads . Nor did I seek to know the reason for this excess of respectfulness ; I was beginning to take to it naturally . At the end of a dusty high - road , where it descends the hill into a town , we drew up close by a high red wall , behind which I heard boys shouting at play . We went among them , accompanied by their master . My father tipped the head boy for the benefit of the school , and following lunch with the master and his daughter , to whom I gave a kiss at her request , a half - holiday was granted to the boys in my name . How they cheered ! The young lady saw my delight , and held me at the window while my father talked with hers ; and for a long time after I beheld them in imagination talking : that is to say , my father issuing his instructions and Mr. Rippenger receiving them like a pliant hodman ; for the result of it was that two days later , without seeing my kings of England , my home again , or London , I was Julia Rippenger 's intimate friend and the youngest pupil of the school . My father told me subsequently that we slept at an hotel those two nights intervening . Memory transplants me from the coach and scarlet livery straight to my place of imprisonment .
18424	18431	18433	18433	Heriot	307	' Look here , young un , '

At prayers morning and evening , it was pitiful to observe her glance of entreaty and her downfallen eyelashes . I guessed that in Heriot 's letters to her he wanted to make her confess something , which she would not do . '
18588	18697	18581	18581	him	1293	' she said , and the consequence of Heriot 's ungrateful obstinacy was that we all beheld her , at the ceremony of the consecration of the new church , place her hand on Mr. Boddy 's arm and allow him to lead her about . Heriot kept his eyes on them ; his mouth was sharp , and his arms stiff by his sides . I was the bearer of a long letter to her that evening . She tore it to pieces without reading it . Next day Heriot walked slowly past Mr. Boddy holding the portrait in his hands . The usher called to him ! '
18705	18710	18700	18700	you	1295	' My hero stared . '
18716	18735	18700	18700	you	1295	' he answered , thrusting it safe in his pocket and fixing his gaze on Julia 's window . '
18743	18748	18700	18700	you	1295	' said Mr. Boddy . '
18757	18761	18700	18700	you	1295	' said Heriot . '
18768	18772	18766	18766	sir	7975	' cried Boddy . '
18781	18794	18779	18779	sir	7975	' replied Heriot , and there was Julia visible at her window . '
18803	18807	18799	18799	sir	7975	' quoth Boddy , '

18835	18842	18844	18844	you	0	' Heriot retorted , quite cool ; '

18865	18874	18875	18875	you	7975	' pursued Boddy , whose colour was thunder : '
18890	18891	18883	18883	you	7975	' '
18895	18901	18883	18883	you	7975	' Heriot corrected his tense ; '
18912	18917	18910	18910	Boddy	305	' he murmured audibly . '
18928	18932	18933	18933	you	7975	' roared Boddy , '
18939	18940	18944	18944	sir	7975	' '
18946	18947	18944	18944	sir	7975	' '
18988	19031	19032	19032	I	0	' I was standing close by my brave Heriot , rather trembling , studious of his manfulness though I was . His left foot was firmly in advance , as he said , just in the manner to start an usher furious : '
19092	19207	19088	19088	Richie	448	' I found the portrait in my hand , and Heriot between me and the usher , in the attitude of a fellow keeping another out of his home at prisoner's - base . He had spied Mr. Rippenger 's head at the playground gate . I had just time to see Heriot and the usher in collision before I ran through the gate and into Julia 's arms in her garden , whither the dreadful prospect of an approaching catastrophe had attracted her . Heriot was merely reported guilty of insolence . He took his five hundred lines of Virgil with his usual sarcastic dignity : all he said to Mr. Rippenger was , '
19216	19256	19214	19214	sir	7975	' which set several of the boys upon Dido 's history , but Heriot was condemned to the battles with Turnus . My share in this event secured Heriot 's friendship to me without costing me the slightest inconvenience . '
19263	19444	19450	19450	Papa	310	' Julia said ; and I felt my rank . Nor was it wonderful I should when Mr. Rippenger was constantly speaking of my father 's magnificence in my presence before company . Allowed to draw on him largely for pocket - money , I maintained my father 's princely reputation in the school . At times , especially when the holidays arrived and I was left alone with Julia , I had fits of mournfulness , and almost thought the boys happier than I was . Going home began to seem an unattainable thing to me . Having a father , too , a regular father , instead of a dazzling angel that appeared at intervals , I considered a benefaction , in its way , some recompense to the boys , for their not possessing one like mine . My anxiety was relieved by my writing letters to my father , addressed to the care of Miss Julia Rippenger , and posting them in her work - basket . She favoured me with very funny replies , signed , '
19452	19806	19450	19450	Papa	310	' about his being engaged killing Bengal tigers and capturing white elephants , a noble occupation that gave me exciting and consolatory dreams of him . We had at last a real letter of his , dated from a foreign city ; but he mentioned nothing of coming to me . I understood that Mr. Rippenger was disappointed with it . Gradually a kind of cloud stole over me . I no longer liked to ask for pocket - money ; I was clad in a suit of plain cloth ; I was banished from the parlour , and only on Sunday was I permitted to go to Julia . I ceased to live in myself . Through the whole course of lessons , at play - time , in my bed , and round to morning bell , I was hunting my father in an unknown country , generally with the sun setting before me : I ran out of a wood almost into a brook to see it sink as if I had again lost sight of him , and then a sense of darkness brought me back to my natural consciousness , without afflicting me much , but astonishing me . Why was I away from him ? I could repeat my lessons in the midst of these dreams quite fairly ; it was the awakening among the circle of the boys that made me falter during a recital and ask myself why I was there and he absent ? They had given over speculating on another holiday and treat from my father ; yet he had produced such an impression in the school that even when I had descended to the level of a total equality with them , they continued to have some consideration for me . I was able to talk of foreign cities and could tell stories , and I was , besides , under the immediate protection of Heriot . But now the shadow of a great calamity fell on me , for my dear Heriot announced his intention of leaving the school next half . '
19834	19900	19820	19832	a fellow who has n't the pluck to strike me like a man	1310	' he said . Mr. Rippenger had the habit of signalizing offenders , in his public prayers , as boys whose hearts he wished to be turned from callousness . He perpetually suspected plots ; and to hear him allude to some deep , long - hatched school conspiracy while we knelt motionless on the forms , and fetch a big breath to bring out , '
19916	19961	19910	19910	he	307	' etc . , was intensely distressing . Together with Walter Heriot , Andrew Saddlebank , our best bowler , the drollest fellow in the world , John Salter , and little Gus Temple , were oftenest cited . They declared that they invariably uttered '
19964	20026	19910	19910	he	307	' as Heriot did , but we none of us heard this defiant murmur of assent from their lips . Heriot pronounced it clearly and cheerfully , causing Julia 's figure to shrink as she knelt with her face in the chair hard by her father 's desk - pulpit . I received the hearty congratulations of my comrades for singing out '
20028	20057	19910	19910	he	307	' louder than Heriot , like a chorister , though not in so prolonged a note , on hearing to my stupefaction Mr. Rippenger implore that the heart of '
20064	20111	20112	20113	Little Richmond	314	' might be turned . I did it spontaneously . Mr. Rippenger gazed at me in descending from his desk ; Julia , too , looking grieved . For my part , I exulted in having done a thing that gave me a likeness to Heriot . '
20116	20121	20122	20122	he	1312	're a little hero , '
20128	20152	20122	20122	he	1312	' I saw old Rippenger whisper to that beast , Boddy . Never mind ; they wo n't hurt you as long as I 'm

20219	20223	20224	20224	he	1312	' All right , '
20283	20290	20274	20274	Julia	303	' Silly boy , silly boy , '
20342	20361	20362	20362	she	303	' Tell Heriot you have my command to say you belong to me and must not be misled , '
20469	20474	20475	20475	I	0	' To Miss Rippenger , '
20478	20484	20460	20460	he	1312	' What have you there ? '
20485	20491	20460	20460	he	1312	' A book , sir . '
20492	20498	20499	20499	I	0	' Show me the book . '
20503	20515	20517	20517	Heriot	307	' It 's a book I have lent him , sir , '
20521	20536	20538	20538	Boddy	305	' I shall see if it 's a fit book for a young boy , '
20586	20589	20579	20579	he	307	' Off ! '
20623	20644	20646	20646	Boddy	305	' You will now understand that you are on a footing with the rest of the boys , you Roy , '
20648	20676	20677	20677	he	307	' Little scoundrelly spoilt urchins , upsetting the discipline of the school , wo n't do here . Heriot , here is your book . I regret , '
20682	20689	20677	20677	he	307	' that a leaf is torn . '
20690	20705	20707	20707	Heriot	307	' I regret , sir , that the poor boy was so savagely handled , '
20716	20726	20727	20727	Heriot	307	' Oh , as much Virgil as you like , '
20730	20737	20727	20727	Heriot	307	' I know him by heart . '
20773	20777	20767	20767	Heriot	307	' I think I 'm
20854	20878	20898	20900	an Indian officer	1326	' Julia blushed very red . She accepted the book with a soft murmur , and the sallow usher had not a word . '
20881	20885	20886	20886	I	0	' said Heriot . '
20945	20968	20928	20929	Miss Rippenger	303	' I was hoping with all my might that she would not deny him . She did , and my heart sank . '
20978	21158	20971	20971	I	0	' she said , cheerfully . After that , I listened with indifference to her petition to Boddy that I might be allowed to accompany her , and was not at all chagrined by his refusal . She laid down the book , saying that I could bring it to her when I was out of disgrace . In the evening we walked in the playground , where Heriot asked me to do a brave thing , which he would never forget . This was that I should take a sharp run right past Boddy , who was pacing up and down before the gate leading into Julia 's garden , and force her to receive the letter . I went bounding like a ball . The usher , suspecting only that I hurried to speak to him , let me see how indignant he was with my behaviour by striding all the faster as I drew near , and so he passed the gate , and I rushed in . I had just time to say to Julia , '
21164	21170	21174	21174	she	1327	'm in such a scrape . '
21180	21192	21174	21174	she	1327	' Surely you would not punish him because he loves me ? '
21286	21291	21292	21292	she	1327	' Ah , Richie , '
21295	21307	21292	21292	she	1327	' I have to pay to have you with me now . '
21324	21345	21317	21317	she	1327	' But he is a boy ! How old is Heriot ? He is not so old as I am ! '
21379	21395	21396	21396	she	1327	' You speak of him as if you were in love with him , Richmond , '
21399	21406	21396	21396	she	1327	' And I do love him , '
21410	21415	21416	21416	she	1327	' Not with me ? '
21419	21436	21416	21416	she	1327	' Yes , I do love you too , if you will not make him angry . '
21437	21450	21451	21451	I	0	' But do you know what it is he wants of me ? '
21454	21472	21451	21451	I	0	' Yes ; he wants you to let him sit close to you for half an hour . '
21484	21487	21489	21489	I	0	' Ah , '
21491	21500	21489	21489	I	0	' but he must n't interrupt the sermon . '
21512	21524	21501	21501	She	1327	' There 's very little he has n't daring enough for ! '
21531	21538	21540	21540	Julia	303	' Is he good as well ? '
21554	21562	21550	21550	I	0	' Good ! Oh , so kind ! '
21569	21582	21583	21583	she	1327	' Very generous to you and every one , is he not ? '
21620	21633	21610	21610	I	0	' You may tell him tell him that I ca n't write . '
21642	21645	21646	21646	he	307	' Humph ! '
21656	21663	21646	21646	he	307	' that means she 'll come ! '
21676	21686	21666	21666	his	307	' Did she give that beast Boddy a rose ? '
21709	21712	21713	21713	he	307	' Humph ! '
21716	21723	21713	21713	he	307	' she shall suffer for that . '
21835	21965	21818	21818	His	307	' heads till they rested on him , when they gave a short flutter and dropped , like a bird shot dead . The boys must have had some knowledge that love was busy in their midst , for they spoke of Heriot and Julia as a jolly couple , and of Boddy as one meaning to play the part of old Nick the first opportunity . She was kinder to them than ever . It was not a new thing that she should send in cakes of her own making , but it was extraordinary that we should get these thoughtful presents as often as once a fortnight , and it became usual to hear a boy exclaim , either among a knot of fellows or to himself , '
21975	22257	21818	21818	His	307	' on her passing out of the room , and sometimes entirely of his own idea . I am persuaded that if she had consented to marry Boddy , the boys would have been seriously disposed to conspire to jump up in the church and forbid the banns . We should have preferred to hand her to the junior usher , Catman , of whom the rumour ran in the school that he once drank a bottle of wine and was sick after it , and he was therefore a weak creature to our minds ; the truth of the rumour being confirmed by his pale complexion . That we would have handed our blooming princess to him was full proof of our abhorrence of Boddy . I might have thought with the other boys that she was growing prettier , only I never could imagine her so delicious as when she smiled at my father . The consequence of the enlistment of the whole school in Heriot 's interests was that at cricket - matches , picnics on the hills , and boating on the canal , Mr. Boddy was begirt with spies , and little Temple reported to Heriot a conversation that he , lying hidden in tall grass , had heard between Boddy and Julia . Boddy asked her to take private lessons in French from him . Heriot listened to the monstrous tale as he was on the point of entering Julia 's boat , where Boddy sat beside her , and Heriot rowed stroke - oar . He dipped his blade , and said , loud enough to be heard by me in Catman 's boat , '
22270	22275	22259	22259	you	1344	' And Boddy said , '
22283	22287	22259	22259	you	1344	' Says Heriot , '
22296	22308	22289	22289	I	0	' Boddy told him he was taking lessons in the school . '
22311	22315	22289	22289	I	0	' says Heriot , '
22320	22334	22259	22259	you	1344	' ; and here he repeated one of Temple 's pieces of communication : '
22346	22355	22289	22289	I	0	' Boddy sprang half up from his seat . '
22365	22369	22358	22358	sir	7975	' he growled . '
22393	22436	22437	22438	Miss Julia	303	' said Heriot . Julia requested to be allowed to land and walk home . Boddy caught the rudder lines and leapt on the bank to hand her out ; then all the boys in her boat and in Catman 's shouted , '
22449	22456	22437	22438	Miss Julia	303	' and we heard wheedling voices : '
22465	22590	22437	22438	Miss Julia	303	' Julia bade us behave well or she would not be able to come out with us . At her entreaty Boddy stepped back to his post , and the two boats went forward like swans that have done ruffling their feathers . The boys were exceedingly disappointed that no catastrophe followed the events of the day . Heriot , they thought , might have upset the boat , saved Julia , and drowned Boddy , and given us a feast of pleasurable excitement : instead of which Boddy lived to harass us with his tyrannical impositions and spiteful slaps , and it was to him , not to our Heriot , that Julia was most gracious . Some of us discussed her conduct . '
22596	22609	22591	22591	She	1352	' said little Temple . I went off to the French dictionary . '
22618	22623	22616	22616	Heriot	1354	' I asked him . '
22635	22645	22625	22625	girls	1145	' said he , dealing me a smart thump . '
22653	22657	22647	22648	a coquette	1353	' I persisted . '
22668	22793	22647	22648	a coquette	1353	' was his answer . My only feeling was jealousy of the superior knowledge of the sex possessed by Temple , for I could not fathom the meaning of coquette ; but he had sisters . Temple and I walked the grounds together , mutually declaring how much we would forfeit for Heriot 's sake . By this time my Sunday visits to Julia had been interdicted : I was plunged , as it were , in the pit of the school , and my dreams of my father were losing distinctness . A series of boxes on the ears from Boddy began to astound and transform me . Mr. Rippenger , too , threatened me with carvings , though my offences were slight . '
22796	22805	22647	22648	a coquette	1353	' said Temple and I , in chorus , '
22813	22885	22807	22807	you	1360	' This was our consolation , and the sentiment of the school . Fancy , then , our amazement to behold him laying the cane on Heriot 's shoulders as fiercely as he could , and Boddy seconding him . The scene was terrible . We were all at our desks doing evening tasks for the morrow , a great matchday at cricket , Boddy watching over us , and bellowing , '
22908	22943	22944	22945	Mr. Boddy	305	' A noise came growing up to us from below , up the stairs from the wet - weather shed , and Heriot burst into the room , old Rippenger after him , panting . '
22951	22955	22947	22947	you	305	' he cried , '
23028	23051	23055	23055	sir	7975	' He laid on Heriot like a wind on a bulrush . Heriot bent his shoulders a trifle , not his head . '
23057	23419	23055	23055	sir	7975	' he said , during the storm of blows , and I , through my tears , imagined him or I do now a young eagle forced to bear the thunder , but with his face to it . Then we saw Boddy lay hands on him , and in a twinkling down pitched the usher , and the boys cheered chirped , I should say , they exulted so , and merely sang out like birds , without any wilfulness of delight or defiance . After the fall of Boddy we had no sense of our hero suffering shame . Temple and I clutched fingers tight as long as the blows went on . We hoped for Boddy to make another attempt to touch Heriot ; he held near the master , looking ready to spring , like a sallow panther ; we kept hoping he would , in our horror of the murderous slashes of the cane ; and not a syllable did Heriot utter . Temple and I started up , unaware of what we were going to do , or of anything until we had got a blow a - piece , and were in the thick of it , and Boddy had us both by the collars , and was knocking our heads together , as he dragged us back to our seats . But the boys told us we stopped the execution . Mr. Rippenger addressed us before he left the school - room . Saddlebank , Salter , and a good many others , plugged their ears with their fists . That night Boddy and Catman paced in the bedchambers , to prevent plotting and conspiracy , they said . I longed to get my arms about Heriot , and thought of him , and dreamed of blood , and woke in the morning wondering what made me cry , and my arms and back very stiff . Heriot was gay as ever , but had fits of reserve ; the word passed round that we were not to talk of yesterday evening . We feared he would refuse to play in the match . '
23423	23432	23434	23434	Saddlebank	311	' said he , staring at us angrily . '
23444	23478	23434	23434	Saddlebank	311	' No , Saddlebank was in excellent trim , though shamefaced , as was Salter , and most of the big boys were . They begged Heriot to let them shake his hand . '
23486	23498	23434	23434	Saddlebank	311	' said Heriot . Julia did not appear at morning prayers . '
23501	23505	23434	23434	Saddlebank	311	' said Temple , '
23517	23600	23601	23601	I	0	' It had nearly made him sick , he added , and I immediately felt that it had nearly made me sick . We supposed we should not see Julia at the match . She came , however , and talked to everybody . I could not contain myself , I wanted so to tell her what had befallen Heriot overnight , while he was batting , and the whole ground cheering his hits . I on one side of her whispered : '
23616	23623	23609	23609	I	0	' And Temple on the other : '
23635	23716	23629	23629	you	303	' We longed to arouse her pity for Heriot at the moment she was admiring him , but she checked us , and as she was surrounded by ladies and gentlemen of the town , and particular friends of hers , we could not speak out . Heriot brought his bat to the booth for eighty - nine runs . His sleeve happened to be unbuttoned , and there , on his arm , was a mark of the cane . '
23719	23731	23732	23732	Richie	448	' I said to Julia . But she looked at me . '
23738	23761	23732	23732	Richie	448	' She assured me I was very pale , and I felt her trembling excessively , and her parasol was covering us . '
23768	23774	23766	23766	Temple	448	' we heard Heriot call ; '
23784	23863	23766	23766	Temple	448	' I went and bowled till I thought my head was flying after the ball and getting knocks , it swam and throbbed so horribly . Temple related that I fell , and was carried all the way from the cricket - field home by Heriot , who would not give me up to the usher . I was in Julia 's charge three days . Every time I spoke of her father and Heriot , she cried , '
23868	23907	23766	23766	Temple	448	' and had tears on her eyelids . When I was quite strong again , I made her hear me out . She held me and rocked over me like a green tree in the wind and rain . '
23913	23925	23766	23766	Temple	448	' she asked , with her mouth working , and to my '
23928	23930	23766	23766	Temple	448	' said '
23939	24013	23933	23933	she	1376	' and seemed to drink and choke , and was one minute calm , all but a trembling hanging underlip , next smiling on me , and next having her face carved in grimaces by the jerking little tugs of her mouth , which I disliked to see , for she would say nothing of what she thought of Heriot , and I thought to myself , though I forbore to speak unkindly , '
24026	24041	24024	24024	Julia	303	' If she had talked of Heriot , I should have thought that crying persons '
24222	24224	24195	24195	he	302	' I 'm
24239	24331	24231	24231	I	0	' said Heriot . A murmur of exultation passed through the school . Mr. Rippenger seized little Temple , and flogged him . Far from dreading the rod , now that Heriot and Temple had tasted it , I thought of punishment as a mad pleasure , not a bit more awful than the burning furze - bush plunged into by our fellows in a follow - my - leader scamper on the common ; so I caught Temple 's hand as he went by me , and said , eagerly , '
24338	24339	24333	24333	I	0	' '
24343	24570	24333	24333	I	0	' was Temple 's answer , for he had taken a stinging dozen , and had a tender skin . Mr. Rippenger called me up to him , to inform me , that whoever I was , and whatever I was , and I might be a little impostor foisted on his benevolence , yet he would bring me to a knowledge of myself : he gave me warning of it ; and if my father objected to his method , my father must write word to that effect , and attend punctually to business duties , for Surrey House was not an almshouse , either for the sons of gentlemen of high connection , or for the sons of vagabonds . Mr. Rippenger added a spurning shove on my shoulder to his recommendation to me to resume my seat . I did not understand him at all . I was , in fact , indebted to a boy named Drew , a known sneak , for the explanation , in itself difficult to comprehend . It was , that Mr. Rippenger was losing patience because he had received no money on account of my boarding and schooling . The intelligence filled my head like the buzz of a fly , occupying my meditations without leading them anywhere . I spoke on the subject to Heriot . '
24578	24585	24333	24333	I	0	' said he of Mr. Rippenger . '
24701	24788	24686	24686	I	0	' He dispersed my brooding fit . I was sure my father was a fountain of gold , and only happened to be travelling . Besides , Heriot 's love for Julia , whom none of us saw now , was an incessant distraction . She did not appear at prayers . She sat up in the gallery at church , hardly to be spied . A letter that Heriot flung over the gardenwall for her was returned to him , open , enclosed by post . '
24795	24826	24686	24686	I	0	' exclaimed Mr. Boddy , lifting it high for Heriot to walk and fetch it ; and his small eyes blinked when Heriot said aloud on his way , cheerfully , '
24835	24845	24830	24833	the colonel in India	1400	' Boddy waited a minute , and then said , '
24853	24865	24830	24833	the colonel in India	1400	' Heriot 's face was scarlet . At first he stuttered , '
24883	24884	24885	24885	You	307	' '
24895	24899	24885	24885	You	307	' said Boddy . '
24907	24908	24905	24905	sir	7975	' '
24920	25401	25402	25402	I	0	' They talked on , and the youngest of us could perceive Boddy was bursting with devilish glee . Heriot got a letter posted to Julia . It was laid on his desk , with her name scratched completely out , and his put in its place . He grew pale and sad , but did his work , playing his games , and only letting his friends speak to him of lessons and play . His counsel to me was , that in spite of everything , I was always to stick to my tasks and my cricket . His sadness he could not conceal . He looked like an old lamp with a poor light in it . Not a boy in the school missed seeing how Boddy 's flat head perpetually had a side - eye on him . All this came to an end . John Salter 's father lived on the other side of the downs , and invited three of us to spend a day at his house . The selection included Heriot , Saddlebank , and me . Mr. Rippenger , not liking to refuse Mr. Salter , consented to our going , but pretended that I was too young . Salter said his mother and sisters very much wished to make my acquaintance . We went in his father 's carriage . A jolly wind blew clouds and dust and leaves : I could have fancied I was going to my own father . The sensation of freedom had a magical effect on me , so that I was the wildest talker of them all . Even in the middle of the family I led the conversation ; and I did not leave Salter 's house without receiving an assurance from his elder sisters that they were in love with me . We drove home back to prison , we called it full of good things , talking of Salter 's father 's cellar of wine and of my majority Burgundy , which I said , believing it was true , amounted to twelve hundred dozen ; and an appointment was made for us to meet at Dipwell Farm , to assist in consuming it , in my honour and my father 's . That matter settled , I felt myself rolling over and over at a great rate , and clasping a juniper tree . The horses had trenched from the chalk road on to the downs . I had been shot out . Heriot and Salter had jumped out Heriot to look after me ; but Saddlebank and the coachman were driving at a great rate over the dark slope . Salter felt some anxiety concerning his father 's horses , so we left him to pursue them , and walked on laughing , Heriot praising me for my pluck . '
25415	25419	25413	25413	Richie	448	' said he . '
25421	25443	25413	25413	Richie	448	're certain to meet again . I shall go to a military school . Mind you enter a cavalry regiment when you 're

25512	25562	25509	25509	he	307	' I ca n't help it : I hope you 've grown tough by this time . I ca n't stay here . I feel more like a dog than a man in that house now . I 'll see you back safe . No crying , young cornet ! '
25656	25664	25666	25666	Heriot	307	' You are here , are you ! '
25673	25689	25666	25666	Heriot	307	' you 'll do me a service the last I shall want in the neighbourhood . '

25732	25741	25729	25729	He	307	' Hush ; keep a look - out . '
25776	25800	25773	25773	Heriot	307	' I have come to say good - bye to you , Julia , dear girl : do n't be afraid of me . '
25850	25859	25860	25860	he	307	' Julia , my sweet , dear girl , '

26085	26099	26005	26005	she	303	' I 'd go through a regiment of sabres to get at you . '
26100	26140	25978	25978	her	303	' But smell the night air ; how sweet ! oh , how sweet ! No , not kiss me , if you are going to leave me ; not kiss me , if you can be so cruel ! '

Look at those two little stars ; no , they hurt me , I ca n't look at them ever again . But no , you are not going ; you want to frighten me . Do smell the flowers . Do n't make them poison to me .

26688	26751	26684	26684	I	0	' he cried as loud as he could . The usher 's words were in a confusion of rage and inquiries . He commanded Heriot to stand on his legs , abused him , asked him what he meant by it , accused him of depravity , of crime , of disgraceful conduct , and attempted to pluck him from the spot . '
26756	26760	26684	26684	I	0	' said Heriot ; '

I was astonished to see Boddy obey him and leave us , after my dear Heriot had hopped with his hand on my shoulder to the corner of the house fronting the road . While we were standing alone a light cart drove by . Heriot hailed it , and hopped up to the driver . '

He answered them that he was the mildest lamb afloat . Despairing of the goose , we resolved to finish the cold repast awaiting us . The Dutch cheese had been bowled into bits . With a portion of the mashed tarts on it , and champagne , it tasted excellently ; toffy to follow . Those boys who chose ginger - wine had it , and drank , despised . The ginger - beer and ale , apples and sallylunns , were reserved for supper . My mind became like a driving sky , with glimpses of my father and Heriot bursting through . '

You 've seen my father , have n't you ? Gentlemen never forget their servants , Temple . Let 's drink lots more champagne . I wish you and I were knights riding across that country there , as they used to , and you saying , " I wonder whether your father 's at home in the castle expecting our arrival . " '

Two boys named Hackman and Montague , not bad fellows , grew desirous of a whiff from his pipe . They had it , and lay down silent , back to back . Bystop was led away in a wretched plight . Two others , Paynter and Ashworth , attacked the apples , rendered desperate by thirst . Saddlebank repelled them furiously . He harangued those who might care to listen . '
31257	31308	31245	31245	I	0	' He wanted us to draw lots again . His fun had entirely departed from him ; all he thought of was seeing the goose out of the pot . I had a feeling next to hatred for one who could talk of goose . Temple must have shared it . '

32630	32750	32627	32628	Naughty Jackie	340	' My companion pulled me along gravely , and once in the air , with a good breath of it in my chest , I felt tall and strong , and knew what had occurred . The tent where I had slept struck me as more curious than my own circumstances . I lifted my face to the sky ; it was just sunrise , beautiful ; bits of long and curling cloud brushed any way close on the blue , and rosy and white , deliciously cool ; the grass was all grey , our dell in shadow , and the tops of the trees burning , a few birds twittering . I sucked a blade of grass . '

34512	34761	34504	34504	I	0	' His wife took it off his shoulders in good humour , saying it was lucky she made the pie big enough for her family and strays . They would not accept more than a shilling for our joint repast . The man said that was the account to a farthing , if I was too proud to be a poor man 's guest , and insisted on treating him like a public . Perhaps I would shake hands at parting ? I did cordially , and remembered him when people were not so civil . They wanted to know whether we had made a runaway match of it . The fun of passing a boys'-school and hearing the usher threaten to punish one fellow for straying from ranks , entertained me immensely . I laughed at them just as the stupid people we met laughed at me , which was unpleasant for the time ; but I knew there was not a single boy who would not have changed places with me , only give him the chance , though my companion was a gipsy girl , and she certainly did look odd company for a gentleman 's son in a tea - garden and public - house parlour . At nightfall , however , I was glad of her and she of me , and we walked hand in hand . I narrated tales of Roman history . It was very well for her so say , '
34767	34857	34762	34762	I	0	' as we lay down to sleep ; I discovered that she would never have hooted over churchyard graves in the night . She confessed she believed the devil went about in the night . Our bed was a cart under a shed , our bed - clothes fern - leaves and armfuls of straw . The shafts of the cart were down , so we lay between upright and level , and awakening in the early light I found our four legs hanging over the seat in front . '
34864	34922	34762	34762	I	0	' said I. She accused me of the same . Next minute she pointed over the side of the cart , and I saw the tramp 's horse and his tents beneath a broad roadside oak - tree . Her face was comical , just like a boy 's who thinks he has escaped and is caught . '
34927	34990	34762	34762	I	0	' she said . Preferring positive independence , I followed her , and then she told me that she had overheard the tramp last night swearing I was as good as a fistful of half - crowns lost to him if he missed me . The image of Rippenger 's school overshadowed me at this communication . With some melancholy I said : '
35001	35007	35008	35008	Mumpers	1690	' She snapped her fingers : '
35010	35243	35244	35244	We	1724	' and walked on carelessly . We were now on the great heaths . They brought the memory of my father vividly ; the smell of the air half inclined me to turn my steps toward London , I grew so full of longing for him . Nevertheless I resolved to have one gaze at Riversley , my aunt Dorothy , and Sewis , the old grey - brown butler , and the lamb that had grown a sheep ; wonderful contrasts to my grand kings of England career . My first clear recollection of Riversley was here , like an outline of a hill seen miles away . I might have shed a tear or two out of love for my father , had not the thought that I was a very queer boy displaced his image . I could not but be a very queer boy , such a lot of things happened to me . Suppose I joined the gipsies ? My companion wished me to . She had brothers , horse - dealers , beautiful fiddlers . Suppose I learnt the fiddle ? Suppose I learnt their language and went about with them and became king of the gipsies ? My companion shook her head ; she could not encourage this ambitious idea because she had never heard of a king of the gipsies or a queen either . '
35248	35311	35312	35312	I	0	' she said , and offended me , for our school believed in a gipsy king , and one fellow , Hackman , used to sing a song of a gipsy king ; and it was as much as to say that my schoolfellows were fools , every one of them . I accused her of telling lies . She grinned angrily . '
35316	35320	35321	35321	she	1726	'em to friends , '
35395	35419	35421	35421	she	1726	' They can , and you come to my mother and my aunt , and see if they ca n't tell your fortune , '
35427	35438	35447	35447	her	1726	' Yes , and that 's how they fool people , '
35481	35498	35499	35499	she	1726	' Go along , you nasty little fellow , your shadow is n't half a yard , '
35543	35559	35534	35534	she	1726	' I say , I 'll keep you warm to - night , I will . '

36014	36047	36005	36005	he	0	' It 's a young woman you 've got there , eh ? Well , odd grows odder , like the man who turned three shillings into five . Now , you gi '

36102	36291	36096	36096	He	0	' Her meaning seized me at once ; we both sprang out of the ditch and ran , dragging our blanket behind us . He pursued , but we eluded him , and dropped on a quiet sleeping - place among furzes . Next morning , when we took the blanket to the farm - house , we heard that the old wretch had traduced our characters , and got a breakfast through charging us with the robbery of the apple - tree . I proved our innocence to the farmer 's wife by putting down a shilling . The sight of it satisfied her . She combed my hair , brought me a bowl of water and a towel , and then gave us a bowl of milk and bread , and dismissed us , telling me I had a fair face and dare - devil written on it : as for the girl , she said of her that she knew gipsies at a glance , and what God Almighty made them for there was no guessing . This set me thinking all through the day , '
36300	36333	36334	36334	I	0	' I bought a red scarf for the girl , and other things she fixed her eyes on , but I lost a great deal of my feeling of fellowship with her . '
36343	36459	36334	36334	I	0	' I thought , when people laughed at us now , and I laughed also . I had a day of rollicking laughter , puzzling the girl , who could only grin two or three seconds at a time , and then stared like a dog that waits for his master to send him off again running , the corners of her mouth twitching for me to laugh or speak , exactly as a dog might wag his tail . I studied her in the light of a harmless sort of unaccountable creature ; witness at any rate for the fact that I had escaped from school . We loitered half the morning round a cricketers '

36576	36688	36574	36574	he	1751	' whatever may be expressed by a slap on the thigh . We played a single - wicket side game , he giving me six runs , and crestfallen he was to find himself beaten ; but , as I let him know , one who had bowled to Heriot for hours and stood against Saddlebank 's bowling , was a tough customer , never mind his age . This man offered me his friendship . He made me sit and eat beside him at the afternoon dinner of the elevens , and sent platefuls of food to the girl , where she was allowed to squat ; and said he , '
36703	36707	36574	36574	he	1751	' I replied , '
36711	36775	36574	36574	he	1751	' We nodded over a glass of ale . In answer to his questions , I stated that I liked farms , I would come and see his farm , I would stay with him two or three days , I would give him my address if I had one , I was on my way to have a look at Riversley Grange . '

40617	40723	40530	40530	I	0	' The squire 's punctilious regard for payments impressed me , it is true . He had saved me from the disgrace of owing money to my detested schoolmaster ; and , besides , I was under his roof , eating of his bread . My late adventurous life taught me that I incurred an obligation by it . Kiomi was the sole victim of my anger that really seemed to lie down to be trampled on , as she deserved for her unpardonable treachery . By degrees my grandfather got used to me , and commenced saying in approval of certain of my performances , '
40733	40754	40726	40726	Beltham	239	' Once out hunting , I took a nasty hedge and ditch in front of him ; he bawled proudly , '
40759	40776	40726	40726	Beltham	239	' and praised me . At night , drinking claret , he said on a sudden , '
40847	40929	40930	40930	He	1899	'em like a huckster ; some do . Nature 's gone it 's damned artifice rules , I tell ye ; and a squire of our country must be three parts lawyer to keep his own . You must learn ; by God , sir , you must cogitate ; you must stew at books and maps , or you 'll have some infernal upstart taking the lead of you , and leaving you nothing but the whiff of his tail . '
40933	40935	40930	40930	He	1899	' I 'm
40948	41126	40930	40930	He	1899	' Thus I grew in his favour , till I heard from him that I was to be the heir of Riversley and his estates , but on one condition , which he did not then mention . If I might have spoken to him of my father , I should have loved him . As it was , I liked old Sewis better , for he would talk to me of the night when my father carried me away , and though he never uttered the flattering words I longed to hear , he repeated the story often , and made the red hall glow with beams of my father 's image . My walks and rides were divided between the road he must have followed toward London , bearing me in his arms , and the vacant place of Kiomi 's camp . Kiomi stood for freedom , pointing into the darkness I wished to penetrate that I might find him . If I spoke of him to my aunt she trembled . She said , '
41144	41375	40930	40930	He	1899	' ; but her excessive trembling checked me , and I kept my feelings to myself a boy with a puzzle in his head and hunger in his heart . At times I rode out to the utmost limit of the hour giving me the proper number of minutes to race back and dress for dinner at the squire 's table , and a great wrestling I had with myself to turn my little horse 's head from hills and valleys lying East ; they seemed to have the secret of my father . Blank enough they looked if ever I despaired of their knowing more than I. My Winter and Summer were the moods of my mind constantly shifting . I would have a week of the belief that he was near Riversley , calling for me ; a week of the fear that he was dead ; long dreams of him , as travelling through foreign countries , patting the foreheads of boys and girls on his way ; or driving radiantly , and people bowing . Radiantly , I say : had there been touches of colour in these visions , I should have been lured off in pursuit of him . The dreams passed colourlessly ; I put colouring touches to the figures seen in them afterward , when I was cooler , and could say , '
41384	41440	40930	40930	He	1899	' yet knew that fancying things was a consolation . By such means I came to paint the mystery surrounding my father in tender colours . I built up a fretted cathedral from what I imagined of him , and could pass entirely away out of the world by entering the doors . Want of boys '
41539	41544	41546	41547	the squire	756	' No , no , '
41549	41623	41546	41547	the squire	756	' my life 's short when the gout 's marching up to my middle , and I 'll see as much of my heir as I can . Why , the lad 's my daughter 's son : He shall grow up among his tenantry . We 'll beat the country and start a man at last to drive his yard of learning into him without rolling sheep 's eyes right and left . '

He informed me that I should have to marry his sister Janet ; for that they could not allow the money to go out of the family . Janet Ilchester was a quaint girl , a favourite of my aunt Dorothy , and the squire 's especial pet ; red - cheeked , with a good upright figure in walking and riding , and willing to be friendly , but we always quarrelled : she detested hearing of Kiomi . '
41936	41940	41933	41934	Harry Richmond	244	' she said . '
41947	41951	41941	41941	I	0	' I replied . '
41958	42205	41953	41953	she	1935	' said Janet ; and I could not deny it ; though the only difference I saw between Janet and Kiomi was , that Janet continually begged favours and gifts of people she knew , and Kiomi of people who were strangers . My allowance of pocket - money from the squire was fifty pounds a year . I might have spent it all in satisfying Janet 's wishes for riding - whips , knives , pencil - cases , cairngorm buttons , and dogs . A large part of the money went that way . She was always getting notice of fine dogs for sale . I bought a mastiff for her , a brown retriever , and a little terrier . She was permitted to keep the terrier at home , but I had to take care of the mastiff and retriever . When Janet came to look at them she called them by their names ; of course they followed me in preference to her ; she cried with jealousy . We had a downright quarrel . Lady Ilchester invited me to spend a day at her house , Charley being home for his Midsummer holidays . Charley , Janet , and I fished the river for trout , and Janet , to flatter me of which I was quite aware , while I dressed her rod as if she was likely to catch something , talked of Heriot , and then said : '
42248	42270	42271	42271	I	0	' ve got unless he 's dead by that time and I need n't go up to him to be kissed . '
42304	42344	42301	42301	I	0	' Now mind what I tell you , Janet : I forgive you this once , for you are an ignorant little girl and know no better . Speak respectfully of my father or you never see me again . '
42350	42360	42346	42346	Charley	269	' Hulloa ! you do n't mean to say you 're
42366	42606	42346	42346	Charley	269	' Janet whimpered that I had called her an ignorant little girl . If she had been silent I should have pardoned her . The meanness of the girl in turning on me when the glaring offence was hers , struck me as contemptible beyond words . Charley and I met half way . He advised me not to talk to his sister of my father . They all knew , he said , that it was no fault of mine , and for his part , had he a rascal for a father , he should pension him and cut him ; to tell the truth , no objection against me existed in his family except on the score of the sort of father I owned to , and I had better make up my mind to shake him off before I grew a man ; he spoke as a friend . I might frown at him and clench my fists , but he did speak as a friend . Janet all the while was nibbling a biscuit , glancing over it at me with mouse - eyes . Her short frock and her greediness , contrasting with the talk of my marrying her , filled me with renewed scorn , though my heart was sick at the mention of my father . I asked her what she knew of him . She nibbled her biscuit , mumbling , '

I was refreshed and satisfied , like the parched earth with dews when it gets no rain , and I was soon well . When I walked among the household again , I found that my week of seclusion had endowed me with a singular gift ; I found that I could see through everybody . Looking at the squire , I thought to myself , '
44205	44265	44199	44199	he	925	' and immediately I forgave the old man ; his antipathy to my father seemed a craze , and to account for it I lay in wait for his numerous illogical acts and words , and smiled visibly in contemplation of his rough unreasonable nature , and of my magnanimity .

The squire caught one of my smiles rising , when he applauded himself lustily for the original idea of matching us ; but the idea was no longer distasteful to me . It appeared to me that if I must some day be married , a wife who would enjoy my narratives , and travel over the four quarters of the globe , as Janet promised to do , in search of him I loved , would be the preferable person . I swore her to secresy ; she was not to tell her brother Charley the subject we conversed on . '

Temple had been previously warned by me to avoid speaking of my father at Riversley ; but I was now in such a boiling state of happiness , believing that my father would certainly appear as he had done at Dipwell farm , brilliant and cheerful , to bear me away to new scenes and his own dear society , that I tossed the valentine to my aunt across the breakfast - table , laughing and telling her to guess the name of the sender . My aunt flushed . '
46466	46480	46351	46351	he	2082	' she said . A stranger was present . The squire introduced us . '
46501	46518	46521	46522	a mate	2084	' For the sake of conversation , Temple asked him if his ship was fully manned . '
46524	46560	46521	46522	a mate	2084	' said the captain . I knew him by reputation as the brother of Squire Gregory Bulsted of Bulsted , notorious for his attachment to my aunt , and laughing - stock of the county . '
46568	46574	46575	46575	I	0	' the captain addressed me . '
46632	46666	46628	46628	Valentine	368	' Temple and I stared hard at a big man with a bronzed skin and a rubicund laugh who expected to receive valentines . My aunt thrust the letter back to me secretly . '
46674	46678	46671	46672	a lady	2024	' said she . '
46692	46771	46689	46690	a lady	2024	' exclaimed the captain . The squire winked at me to watch his guest . Captain Bulsted fed heartily ; he was thoroughly a sailor - gentleman , between the old school and the new , and , as I perceived , as far gone in love with my aunt as his brother was . Presently Sewis entered carrying a foaming tankard of old ale , and he and the captain exchanged a word or two upon Jamaica . '
46802	46807	46800	46800	captain	1510	' said the squire . '
46813	46818	46811	46811	sir	7975	' the captain replied ; '
46863	46872	46854	46854	Sewis	363	' My aunt made an effort to retire . '
46882	46907	46908	46909	Miss Beltham	371	' said the squire , trying to frown , but twinkling ; my aunt tried to smile , and sat as if on springs . '
46911	46926	46908	46909	Miss Beltham	371	' the captain bowed to her , and to each one as he spoke , '
46993	47023	47039	47039	he	2099	' cruise in a cabin is pretty much equivalent to the same amount of time spent in a coffin , I can assure you ; with the difference that you 're
47035	47036	47039	47039	he	2099	' '
47044	47050	47039	47039	he	2099	' the squire struck in . '
47395	47450	47384	47384	I	0	' So Captain Bulsted concluded . Our eyes were directed on my aunt . The squire bade her to speak out , for she had his sanction to act according to her judgement and liking . She said , with a gracefulness that gave me a little aching of pity for the poor captain : '
47470	47481	47482	47482	I	0	' The captain stood up , and bowing humbly , replied '
47490	47497	47488	47488	ma'am	1084	' My aunt quitted the room . '
47505	47550	47503	47503	Sewis	363	' said the captain . Gradually the bottom of the great tankard turned up to the ceiling . He drank to the last drop in it . The squire asked him whether he found consolation in that . The captain sighed prodigiously and said : '
47558	47559	47556	47556	sir	7975	' '
47644	47645	47636	47636	you	7975	' '

47695	47755	47756	47756	You	7975	' The captain thanked him cordially , but declined , saying that he would rather make a beast of himself in another place . The squire vainly pressed his hospitality by assuring him of perfect secresy on our part , as regarded my aunt , and offering him Sewis and one of the footmen to lift him to bed . '
47763	47768	47761	47761	squire	8947	' said the captain ; '
47796	47797	47778	47778	I	0	' '
47808	47840	47876	47876	my	0	' said the squire , shaking him by the hand . Forty years ago a gentleman , a baronet , had fallen on the back of his head and never recovered . '
47853	47860	47876	47876	my	0	' said the captain , nodding ; '
47891	47892	47876	47876	my	0	' '

47919	47979	47903	47903	yours	7975	' Temple and I followed him out of the house , fascinated by his manners and oddness . He invited us to jump into the chariot beside him . We were witnesses of the meeting between him and his brother , a little sniffling man , as like the captain as a withered nut is like a milky one . '
47985	47990	47983	47983	William	361	' said Squire Gregory . '
48002	48029	48000	48000	Greg	369	' said the captain . They wrenched hands thereupon , like two carpet - shakers , with a report , and much in a similar attitude . '
48048	48053	48042	48042	I	0	' said the captain ; '
48215	48323	48324	48324	I	0	' Temple was enraptured with him . He declared he had been thinking seriously for a long time of entering the Navy , and his admiration of the captain must have given him an intuition of his character , for he persuaded me to send to Riversley for our evening - dress clothes , appearing in which at the dinner - table , we received the captain 's compliments , as being gentlemen who knew how to attire ourselves to suit an occasion . The occasion , Squire Gregory said , happened to him too often for him to distinguish it by the cut of his coat . '
48346	48351	48332	48332	you	369	' said the captain . '
48359	48364	48332	48332	you	369	' said Squire Gregory . '
48457	48507	48683	48684	The captain	9106	'm hauled prisoner into a foreign port in time of war , you may talk of accidents . Mr. Harry Richmond , Mr. Temple , I have the accidental happiness of drinking to your healths in a tumbler of hock wine . Nominative , hic , haec , hoc . '
48524	48532	48534	48535	the captain	9106	' Claret will do for the Vocative , '
48539	48665	48534	48535	the captain	9106	' the more so as there is plenty of it at your table , Greg . Ablative hoc , hac , hoc , which sounds as if the gentleman had become incapable of speech beyond the name of his wine . So we will abandon the declension of the article for a dash of champagne , which there 's no declining , I hope . Wonderful men , those Romans ! They fought their ships well , too . A question to you , Greg . Those heathen Pagan dogs had a religion that encouraged them to swear . Now , my experience of life pronounces it to be a human necessity to rap out an oath here and there . What do you say ? '
48670	48682	48683	48684	The captain	9106	' Drinking , and no thinking , at dinner , William . '
48688	48697	48683	48684	The captain	9106	' I 'll take the opportunity , as we 're
48712	48733	48708	48708	sir	7975	' Temple addressed the captain , whose face was resplendent ; and he bowed , and drank , and said , '
48746	48754	48744	48744	you	0	' Temple thanked him for the compliment . '
48810	48811	48807	48808	Mr. Harry	244	' '

48864	48883	48860	48862	a royal fellow	2167	' said Temple . We all drank to one another . The captain 's eyes scrutinized me speculatingly . '
48895	49001	49002	49002	I	0	' I heard him say in a faltering rough tone . They forgot the presence of Temple and me , but spoke as if they thought they were whispering . The captain assured his brother that Squire Beltham had given him as much fair play as one who holds a balance . Squire Gregory doubted it , and sipped and kept his nose at his wineglass , crabbedly repeating his doubts of it . The captain then remarked , that doubting it , his conscience permitted him to use stratagems , though he , the captain , not doubting it , had no such permission . '
49015	49020	49004	49004	I	0	' said Squire Gregory . '

49255	49289	49242	49242	I	0	' Temple shot a walnut at me . I pretended to be meditating carelessly , and I had the heat and roar of a conflagration round my head . Presently the captain said , '

49304	49309	49302	49302	Cock	373	' Squire Gregory replied . '

50003	50018	49993	49993	you	7975	' Temple and I took counsel together hastily ; we cried in a breath : '

50042	50048	50040	50040	Julia	303	' the captain echoed us . '
50097	50166	50091	50091	Julia	378	' The captain fell commendably forward . Squire Gregory had already dropped . Temple and I tried to meet , but did not accomplish it till next morning at breakfast . A couple of footmen carried us each upstairs in turn , as if they were removing furniture . Out of this strange evening came my discovery of my father , and the captain 's winning of a wife .
50234	50238	50231	50231	I	0	' Shall I ? '
50615	50619	50620	50620	he	448	' My goodness ! '

50652	50672	50680	50680	he	2254	' Yes , about that ; but I 'll buy you one , one day or other , Temple . '
50717	50737	50739	50739	he	2254	' I do n't ... do n't think that I ... I care for nothing but Newfoundlands and mastiffs , '
50751	50756	50757	50757	I	0	' Girls like pugs , '

50780	50796	50777	50777	I	0	' A pocket - knife for the hunting - field is a very good thing . '
50797	50803	50805	50805	Temple	448	' Do you think so ? '
50834	50849	50812	50812	he	448	' You can get one for thirty shillings . We 'll get one when we 're
50854	50869	50853	50853	They	2256	're just as useful for women as they are for us , you know . '
50870	50882	50884	50884	Temple	448	' Why , of course they are , if they hunt , '
50886	50894	50884	50884	Temple	448	' And we must n't lose time , '
50906	50920	50895	50895	I	0	' for hunting 'll soon be over . It 's February , mind ! '
50921	50928	50929	50929	Temple	448	' Oh , lots of time ! '
51107	51122	51095	51095	He	448	' Oh , yes ! you and I 'll go back together , Richie , '
51241	51320	51236	51236	she	356	' Oh , you own dear precious pet darling beauty ! if I might only feed you every day of my life I should be happy ! I curtsey to him every time I see him . If I were his master , the men should all off hats , and the women all curtsey , to Emperor Ajax , my dog ! my own ! my great , dear irresistible love ! Then she nodded at me , '
51328	51334	51335	51335	You	2263	' And then at Temple , '
51342	51366	51367	51367	He	2264	' Ajax was a source of pride to me . However , I heard Temple murmur , in a tone totally unlike himself , '
51375	51383	51384	51384	You	2263	' ; and I said to him , '
51441	51647	51435	51435	mistress	2266	' I sacrificed my dog to bring Temple to his senses . I thought it would touch him to see how much I could sacrifice just to get an excuse for begging him to start . He did not even thank me . Ajax soon wore one of Janet 's collars , like two or three other of the Riversley dogs , and I had the satisfaction of hearing Temple accept my grandfather 's invitation for a further fortnight . And , meanwhile , I was the one who was charged with going about looking lovelorn ! I smothered my feelings and my reflections on the wisdom of people . At last my aunt Dorothy found the means of setting me at liberty on the road to London . We had related to her how Captain Bulsted toasted Julia Rippenger , and we had both declared in joke that we were sure the captain wished to be introduced to her . My aunt reserved her ideas on the subject , but by - and - by she proposed to us to ride over to Julia , and engage her to come and stay at Riversley for some days . Kissing me , my aunt said , '
51660	51975	51648	51648	She	2267	' The words revived my affection for Julia . Strong in the sacred sense of gratitude , I turned on Temple , reproaching him with selfish forgetfulness of her good heart and pretty face . Without defending himself , as he might have done , he entreated me to postpone our journey for a day ; he and Janet had some appointment . Here was given me a noble cause and matter I need not shrink from speaking of . I lashed Temple in my aunt 's presence with a rod of real eloquence that astonished her , and him , and myself too ; and as he had a sense of guilt not quite explicable in his mind , he consented to bear what was in reality my burden ; for Julia had distinguished me and not him with all the signs of affection , and of the two I had the more thoroughly forgotten her ; I believe Temple was first in toasting her at Squire Gregory 's table . There is nothing like a pent - up secret of the heart for accumulating powers of speech ; I mean in youth . The mental distilling process sets in later , and then you have irony instead of eloquence . From brooding on my father , and not daring to mention his name lest I should hear evil of it , my thoughts were a proud family , proud of their origin , proud of their isolation , and not to be able to divine them was for the world to confess itself basely beneath their level . But , when they did pour out , they were tremendous , as Temple found . This oratorical display of mine gave me an ascendancy over him . He adored eloquence , not to say grandiloquence : he was the son of a barrister . '
51987	51993	51985	51985	Richie	448	' he said of Julia . '
51995	52008	51985	51985	Richie	448	' m ready to be off as soon as you like ; I 'm
52017	52054	52055	52055	Temple	448	' ; which was untrue , but it was useless to tell him so . I sighed at my sad gift of penetration , and tossed the fresh example of it into the treasury of vanity . '
52057	52065	52055	52055	Temple	448	' said I , dissembling a little ; '
52127	52128	52129	52129	I	0	' '
52130	52142	52143	52143	Temple	448	'm not going to let any one make comparisons between us , '
52561	52578	52557	52557	Temple	448	' Richie , we shall do it yet ! I 've been funking , but now I 'm
52643	52772	52619	52619	her	356	' hic - haec - hocks did n't get strained on this hard nominative - plural - masculine of the article road . Do n't you fancy yourself dining with the captain , Richie ? Dative huic , says old Squire Gregory . I like to see him at dinner , because he loves the smell of his wine . Oh ! it 's nothing to boast of , but we did drink them under the table , it ca n't be denied . Janet heard of it . Hulloa ! you talk of a hunting - knife . What do you say to a pair of skates ? Here we are in for a frost of six weeks . It strikes me , a pair of skates ... '
52811	52906	52803	52803	Uberly	381	' legs . We heard him twice out of the deepening fog . I called to Temple that he was right , we should do it . Temple hurrahed rather breathlessly . At the end of an hour I pulled up at an inn , where I left the horses to be groomed and fed , and walked away rapidly as if I knew the town , Temple following me with perfect confidence , and , indeed , I had no intention to deceive him . We entered a new station of a railway . '
52909	52913	52803	52803	Uberly	381	' said Temple , '
52922	52955	52803	52803	Uberly	381	' When the railway clerk asked me what place I wanted tickets for , London sprang to my mouth promptly in a murmur , and taking the tickets I replied to Temple , '
52972	53054	53055	53055	I	0	' ; but my heart beat as the carriages slid away with us ; an affectionate commiseration for Temple touched me when I heard him count on our being back at Riversley in time to dress for dinner . He laughed aloud at the idea of our plumping down on Rippenger 's school , getting a holiday for the boys , tipping them , and then off with Julia , exactly like two Gods of the Mythology , Apollo and Mercury . '
53070	53155	53055	53055	I	0	' he said , and trying to catch glimpses of the country , and musing , and singing , he continued to feel like one of those blissful Gods until wonder at the passage of time supervened . Amazement , when he looked at my watch , struck him dumb . Ten minutes later we were in yellow fog , then in brown . Temple stared at both windows and at me ; he jumped from his seat and fell on it , muttering , '
53163	53206	53160	53160	I	0	' but he had accurately recognized London 's fog . I left him unanswered to bring up all his senses , which the railway had outstripped , for the contemplation of this fact , that we two were in the city of London .
53536	53543	53544	53544	Temple	448	' Oh ! it 's London , '
53572	53582	53583	53583	he	448	' I say , Richie , this is London , '
53592	53622	53583	53583	he	448	' you know by the size of the station ; and besides , there 's the fog . Oh ! it 's London . We 've overshot it , we 're
53627	53831	53583	53583	he	448	' I could spare no sympathy for his feelings , and I did not respond to his inquiring looks . Now that we were here I certainly wished myself away , though I would not have retreated , and for awhile I was glad of the discomforts besetting me ; my step was hearty as I led on , meditating upon asking some one the direction to the Bench presently . We had to walk , and it was nothing but traversing on a slippery pavement atmospheric circles of black brown and brown red , and sometimes a larger circle of pale yellow ; the colours of old bruised fruits , medlars , melons , and the smell of them ; nothing is more desolate . Neither of us knew where we were , nor where we were going . We struggled through an interminable succession of squalid streets , from the one lamp visible to its neighbour in the darkness : you might have fancied yourself peering at the head of an old saint on a smoky canvas ; it was like the painting of light rather than light . Figures rushed by ; we saw no faces . Temple spoke solemnly : '
53844	54003	54004	54004	Fellows	8551	' A street - boy overheard him and chaffed him . Temple got the worst of it , and it did him good , for he had the sweetest nature in the world . We declined to be attended by link - boys ; they would have hurt our sense of independence . Possessed of a sovereign faith that , by dint of resolution , I should ultimately penetrate to the great square enclosing the Bench , I walked with the air of one who had the map of London in his eye and could thread it blindfold . Temple was thereby deceived into thinking that I must somehow have learnt the direction I meant to take , and knew my way , though at the slightest indication of my halting and glancing round his suspicions began to boil , and he was for asking some one the name of the ground we stood on : he murmured , '
54010	54142	54143	54143	I	0	' By this time he clearly understood that I had come to London on purpose : he could not but be aware of the object of my coming , and I was too proud , and he still too delicate , to allude to it . The fog choked us . Perhaps it took away the sense of hunger by filling us as if we had eaten a dinner of soot . We had no craving to eat until long past the dinner - hour in Temple 's house , and then I would rather have plunged into a bath and a bed than have been requested to sit at a feast ; Temple too , I fancy . We knew we were astray without speaking of it . Temple said , '
54152	54395	54396	54396	Sinbad	388	' It seemed to me years since I had tasted the delicious crushing of the sweet bubbles in my mouth . But I did not blame them ; I was after my father : he , dear little fellow , had no light ahead except his devotion to me : he must have had a touch of conscious guilt regarding his recent behaviour , enough to hold him from complaining formally . He complained of a London without shops and lights , wondered how any one could like to come to it in a fog , and so forth ; and again regretted our having drunk champagne in the morning ; a sort of involuntary whimpering easily forgiven to him , for I knew he had a gallant heart . I determined , as an act of signal condescension , to accost the first person we met , male or female , for Temple 's sake . Having come to this resolve , which was to be an open confession that I had misled him , wounding to my pride , I hoped eagerly for the hearing of a footfall . We were in a labyrinth of dark streets where no one was astir . A wretched dog trotted up to us , followed at our heels a short distance , and left us as if he smelt no luck about us ; our cajoleries were unavailing to keep that miserable companion . '

I thought Ulysses was right , otherwise we should have had no slaying of the Suitors but Temple shyly urged that to have a Goddess caring for you and she was handsomer than Penelope , who must have been an oldish woman was something to make you feel as you do on a hunting morning , when there are half - a - dozen riding - habits speckling the field a whole glorious day your own among them ! This view appeared to me very captivating , save for an obstruction in my mind , which was , that Goddesses were always conceived by me as statues . They talked and they moved , it was true , but the touch of them was marble ; and they smiled and frowned , but they had no variety they were never warm . '
54996	55030	54992	54992	I	0	' muttered Temple , puffing at the raw fog . He admitted he had thought just the contrary , and that the cold had suggested to him the absurdity of leaving a Goddess . '

55052	55115	55121	55121	Temple	448	'm like him . It 's true I 've always admired Ulysses ; he could fight best , talk best , and plough , and box , and how clever he was ! Take him all round , who would n't rather have had him for a father than Achilles ? And there were just as many women in love with him . '

55306	55489	55271	55271	She	371	' The contrast he presented to my sensations between our pleasant home and this foggy solitude gave me a pang of dismay . I diverged from my favourite straight line , which seemed to pierce into the bowels of the earth , sharp to the right . Soon or late after , I can not tell , we were in the midst of a thin stream of people , mostly composed of boys and young women , going at double time , hooting and screaming with the delight of loosened animals , not quite so agreeably ; but animals never hunted on a better scent . A dozen turnings in their company brought us in front of a fire . There we saw two houses preyed on by the flames , just as if a lion had his paws on a couple of human creatures , devouring them ; we heard his jaws , the cracking of bones , shrieks , and the voracious in - and - out of his breath edged with anger . A girl by my side exclaimed , '
55533	55544	55679	55679	you	2335	' I turned to her , hardly able to speak . '
55554	55584	55551	55551	you	2335	' She pointed . I looked on an immense high wall . The blunt flames of the fire opposite threw a sombre glow on it . The girl said , '

55643	55676	55601	55601	you	2335	' I asked . She answered that it was , and that she and her friend were the persons to show me the way in there . Her friend answered more sensibly : '

A big bright round moon was dancing over the vessel 's bowsprit , and this , together with the tug thumping into the distance , and the land receding , gave me coming on my wrath suffocating emotions . No difficulties were presented in my way . I was led up to a broad man in a pilot - coat , who stood square , and looked by the bend of his eyebrows as if he were always making head against a gale . He nodded to my respectful salute . '
58323	58338	58138	58138	I	0	' he said , and turned his back to me . I addressed him , '
58387	58416	58381	58381	I	0	' Joe spoke a word to the captain , who kept his back as broad to me as a school - slate for geography and Euclid 's propositions . '
58421	58574	58381	58381	I	0	' the captain repeated . I tried to get round him to dash a furious sentence or so in his face , since there was no producing any impression on his back ; but he occupied the whole of a way blocked with wire - coil , and rope , and boxes , and it would have been ridiculous to climb this barricade when by another right - about - face he could in a minute leave me volleying at the blank space between his shoulders . Joe touched my arm , which , in as friendly a way as I could assume , I bade him not do a second time ; for I could ill contain myself as it was , and beginning to think I had been duped and tricked , I was ready for hostilities . I could hardly bear meeting Temple on my passage to the cabin . '
58579	58635	58575	58577	Captain Jasper Welsh	397	' he was reiterating , as if sounding it to discover whether it had an ominous ring : it was the captain 's name , that he had learnt from one of the seamen . Irritated by his repetition of it , I said , I know not why , or how the words came : '
58651	58658	58661	58661	he	2441	' This set Temple off laughing : '
58677	59013	58661	58661	he	2441	' I was obliged to request Temple not to joke , but the next moment I had launched Captain Jasper Welsh on a piratical exploit ; Temple lifted the veil from his history , revealing him amid the excesses of a cannibal feast . I dragged him before a British jury ; Temple hanged him in view of an excited multitude . As he boasted that there was the end of Captain Welsh , I broke the rope . But Temple spoiled my triumph by depriving him of the use of his lower limbs after the fall , for he was a heavy man . I could not contradict it , and therefore pitched all his ship 's crew upon the gallows in a rescue . Temple allowed him to be carried off by his faithful ruffians , only stipulating that the captain was never after able to release his neck from the hangman 's slip knot . The consequence was that he wore a shirt - collar up to his eyebrows for concealment by day , and a pillow - case over his head at night , and his wife said she was a deceived unhappy woman , and died of curiosity . The talking of even such nonsense as this was a relief to us in our impatience and helplessness , with the lights of land heaving far distant to our fretful sight through the cabin windows . When we had to talk reasonably we were not so successful . Captain Welsh was one of those men who show you , whether you care to see them or not , all the processes by which they arrive at an idea of you , upon which they forthwith shape their course . Thus , when he came to us in the cabin , he took the oil - lamp in his hand and examined our faces by its light ; he had no reply to our remonstrances and petitions : all he said was , '
59021	59025	59020	59020	you	2445	're both gentlemen born '

59404	59418	59354	59354	Temple	448	' Thank you very much , captain , we 'll do that when we 're

59444	59515	59427	59427	You	0	' he remarked . We beheld him turning over the leaves of a Bible . Now , this sight of the Bible gave me a sense of personal security , and a notion of hypocrisy in his conduct as well ; and perceiving that we had conjectured falsely as to his meaning to cast us on shore per ship , his barque Priscilla , I burst out in great heat , '
59528	59588	59522	59522	You	2460	' Temple chimed in , in a similar strain . Fairly enraged , we flung at him without anything of what I thought eloquence . The captain ruminated up and down the columns of his Bible . I was stung to feel that we were like two small terriers baiting a huge mild bull . At last he said , '
59596	59597	59592	59594	the Prodigal Son	2461	' '
59600	59638	59639	59640	Young gentlemen	8701	' groaned Temple , at the mention of this worn - out old fellow , who has gone in harness to tracts ever since he ate the fatted calf . But the captain never heeded his interruption . '
59648	59671	59704	59705	The Lord	832	' ve been barking at me . If I 'd had him early in life on board my vessel , I hope I 'm

And let me advise you not to talk ; in your situation talking 's temptation to lying . You 'll do me the obligation to feed at my table . And when I hand you back to your parents , why , they 'll thank me , if you wo n't . But it 's not thanks I look for : it 's my bounden Christian duty I look to . I reckon a couple o '
60029	60039	60095	60095	He	2473	' The captain uplifted his arm , ejaculating solemnly , '
60042	60046	60047	60047	You	2473	' and faltered . '
60053	60061	60047	60047	You	2473	' said Temple , with savage disdain . '
60074	60082	60095	60095	He	2473	' pups from turning wolves . And I 'm

60101	60169	60095	60095	He	2473	' Temple muttered to me . I considered the detection of Captain Welsh 's hypocrisy unnecessary , almost a condescension toward familiarity ; but the ire in my bosom was boiling so that I found it impossible to roll out the flood of eloquence with which I was big . Soon after , I was trying to bribe the man with all my money and my watch . '
60176	60180	60095	60095	He	2473	' said he . '
60185	60189	60095	60095	He	2473	' muttered Temple . '
60193	60211	60095	60095	He	2473	' said I. The captain 's head went like a mechanical hammer , to express something indescribable . '
60215	60219	60095	60095	He	2473	' I continued , '
60235	60236	60095	60095	He	2473	' '
60246	60292	60293	60293	Captain	1510	' said the captain , in a tone as much as to say we were bad all over . I saw the waters slide by his cabin - windows . My desolation , my humiliation , my chained fury , tumbled together . Out it came '
60343	60394	60404	60404	he	2483	're at your mercy , but do behave like an honest man . You shall be paid or not , just as you please , for putting us on shore , but we shall be eternally grateful to you . Of course you mean kindly to us ; we see that '
60395	60403	60404	60404	he	2483	' I thank the Lord for it ! '
60407	60453	60404	60404	he	2483	' Only you really are under a delusion . It 's extraordinary . You ca n't be quite in your right senses about us ; you must be I do n't mean to speak disrespectfully - what we call on shore , cracked about us .... '
60466	60521	60458	60458	they	2484	' he remarked . Half - encouraged , and in the belief that I might be getting eloquent , I appealed to his manliness . Why should he take advantage of a couple of boys ? I struck the key of his possible fatherly feelings : What misery were not our friends suffering now . '
60535	60559	60458	60458	they	2484	' he flung in his word . I bade him , with more pathetic dignity reflect on the dreadful hiatus in our studies . '
60566	60606	60458	60458	they	2484	' he asked . I would not reply to the cold - blooded question . He said the New Testament was written in Greek , he knew , and happy were those who could read it in the original . '
60622	60657	60458	60458	they	2484	' said Temple , an observation that exasperated me because it seemed more to the point than my lengthy speech , and betrayed that he thought so ; however , I took it up : '
60681	60708	60717	60718	Captain Welsh	397	' He played thumb and knuckles on his table . Just when I was hoping that good would come of the senseless tune , Temple cried , '
60729	60730	60722	60722	you	397	' '
60746	60773	60743	60743	Providence	400	' said the captain , and he rose . We declined his offer of tea , though I fancy we could have gnawed at a bone . '
60782	60786	60787	60787	You	397	' he said . '
60793	60827	60787	60787	You	397	're my guests , shipmates , and apprentices in the path of living ; my cabin and my substance , the same as if you were what the North - countrymen call bairns o '
60834	60882	60883	60883	We	2493	' my own . My wife was a barren woman . I 've none but my old mother at home . Have your sulks out , lads ; you 'll come round like the Priscilla on a tack , and discover you 've made way by it . '
60916	60929	60930	60930	Temple	448	' His wife a barren woman ! what 's that to us ! '
60938	61109	60930	60930	Temple	448	' So was Sarah . His cabin and his substance ! He talks more like a preacher than a sailor . I should like to see him in a storm ! He 's no sailor at all . His men hate him . It would n't be difficult to get up a mutiny on board this ship . Richie , I understand the whole plot : he 's in want of cabin - boys . The fellow has impressed us . We shall have to serve till we touch land . Thank God , there 's a British consul everywhere ; I say that seriously . I love my country ; may she always be powerful ! My life is always at her Did you feel that pitch of the ship ? Of all the names ever given to a vessel , I do think Priscilla is without exception the most utterly detestable . Oh ! there again . No , it 'll be too bad , Richie , if we 're

61122	61513	60930	60930	Temple	448	' said I , scarcely venturing to speak lest I should cry or be sick . We both felt that the vessel was conspiring to ruin our self - respect . I set my head to think as hard as possible on Latin verses my instinct must have drawn me to them as to a species of intellectual biscuit steeped in spirit , tough , and comforting , and fundamentally opposed to existing circumstances , otherwise I can not account for the attraction . They helped me for a time ; they kept off self - pity , and kept the machinery of the mind at work . They lifted me , as it were , to an upper floor removed from the treacherously sighing Priscilla . But I came down quickly with a crash ; no dexterous management of my mental resources could save me from the hemp - like smell of the ship , nor would leaning over the taffrail , nor lying curled under a tarpaulin . The sailors heaped pilot - coats upon us . It was a bad ship , they said , to be sick on board of , for no such thing as brandy was allowed in the old Priscilla . Still I am sure I tasted some before I fell into a state of semi - insensibility . As in a trance I heard Temple 's moans , and the captain 's voice across the gusty wind , and the forlorn crunching of the ship down great waves . The captain 's figure was sometimes stooping over us , more great - coats were piled on us ; sometimes the wind whistled thinner than one fancies the shrieks of creatures dead of starvation and restless , that spend their souls in a shriek as long as they can hold it on , say nursery - maids ; the ship made a truce with the waters and grunted ; we took two or three playful blows , we were drenched with spray , uphill we laboured , we caught the moon in a net of rigging , away we plunged ; we mounted to plunge again and again . I reproached the vessel in argument for some imaginary inconsistency . Memory was like a heavy barrel on my breast , rolling with the sea .

61833	62146	62147	62149	Poor Mr. Double	395	' said Temple . I smiled , thinking I perceived the reason why I had failed in my oration over - night ; so I determined that on no future occasion would I let pride stand in the way of provender . Breakfast had completely transformed us We held it due to ourselves that we should demand explanations from Joseph Double , the mate , and then , after hearing him , furnish them with a cordial alacrity to which we might have attached unlimited credence had he not protested against our dreaming him to have supplied hot rum - and - water on board , we wrote our names and addresses in the captain 's log - book , and immediately asked permission to go to the mast - head . He laughed . Out of his cabin there was no smack of the preacher in him . His men said he was a stout seaman , mad on the subject of grog and girls . Why , it was on account of grog and girls that he was giving us this dish of salt - water to purify us ! Grog and girls ! cried we . We vowed upon our honour as gentlemen we had tasted grog for the first time in our lives on board the Priscilla . How about the girls ? they asked . We informed them we knew none but girls who were ladies . Thereupon one sailor nodded , one sent up a crow , one said the misfortune of the case lay in all girls being such precious fine ladies ; and one spoke in dreadfully blank language , he accused us of treating the Priscilla as a tavern for the entertainment of bad company , stating that he had helped to row me and my associates from the shore to the ship . '
62151	62155	62162	62162	him	2519	' says he ; '
62171	62186	62162	62162	him	2519	' that snapdragon bowl you was in or quashmire , call it ; so he '
62192	62227	62228	62230	The other sailors	2522	' the bait you was swallowing , which was making the devil serve the Lord 's turn . And I 'll remember that night , for I yielded to swearing , and drank too ! '
62341	62365	62367	62368	the captain	9106	' Such lessons as these , maybe , do n't have the meaning on land they get to have on the high seas , '
62370	62402	62367	62368	the captain	9106	' and those youngsters you talk of were not called in to throw a light on passages : for I may teach you ship 's business aboard my barque , but we 're
62409	62507	62367	62368	the captain	9106	' He groaned heartily to hear that our learning lay in the direction of Pagan Gods and Goddesses , and heathen historians and poets ; adding , it was not new to him , and perhaps that was why the world was as it was . Nor did he wonder , he said , at our running from studies of those filthy writings loose upon London ; it was as natural as dunghill steam . Temple pretended he was forced by the captain 's undue severity to defend Venus ; he said , I thought rather wittily , '
62547	62557	62558	62558	She	2529	' But the captain answered none the less keenly , '
62600	62733	62588	62588	she	2529	' He might be right , still our mien was evil in reciting the lessons from Scripture ; and though Captain Welsh had intelligence we could not draw into it the how and the why of the indignity we experienced . We had rather he had been a savage captain , to have braced our spirits to sturdy resistance , instead of a mild , good - humoured man of kind intentions , who lent us his linen to wear , fed us at his table , and taxed our most gentlemanly feelings to find excuses for him . Our way of revenging ourselves becomingly was to laud the heroes of antiquity , as if they had possession of our souls and touched the fountain of worship . Whenever Captain Welsh exclaimed , '
62737	62742	62588	62588	she	2529	' or the equivalent , '
62748	62995	62588	62588	she	2529	' we referred him to Plutarch for our great exemplar . It was Alcibiades gracefully consuming his black broth that won the captain 's thanks for theological acuteness , or the young Telemachus suiting his temper to the dolphin 's moods , since he must somehow get on shore on the dolphin 's back . Captain Welsh could not perceive in Temple the personifier of Alcibiades , nor Telemachus in me ; but he was aware of an obstinate obstruction behind our compliance . This he called the devil coiled like a snake in its winter sleep . He hurled texts at it openly , or slyly dropped a particularly heavy one , in the hope of surprising it with a death - blow . We beheld him poring over his Bible for texts that should be sovereign medicines for us , deadly for the devil within us . Consequently , we were on the defensive : bits of Cicero , bits of Seneca , soundly and nobly moral , did service on behalf of Paganism ; we remembered them certainly almost as if an imp had brought them from afar . Nor had we any desire to be in opposition to the cause he supported . What we were opposed to was the dogmatic arrogance of a just but ignorant man , who had his one specific for everything , and saw mortal sickness in all other remedies or recreations . Temple said to him , '
63037	63042	63022	63022	he	2536	' Captain Welsh replied , '
63047	63079	63082	63082	he	2536	' Canterbury sailed the sea , and lived in Foul Alley , Waterside , when on shore , and so felt what it is to toss on top of the waves o '

Supposing he did not relish the performance , he could enjoy a spell in the open air , he said , and this he speedily decided to do . Had we not been bound in honour to remain for him to fetch us , we also should have retired from a representation of which we understood only the word ja . It was tiresome to be perpetually waiting for the return of this word . We felt somewhat as dogs must feel when human speech is addressed to them . Accordingly , we professed , without concealment , to despise the whole performance . I reminded Temple of a saying of the Emperor Charles V. as to a knowledge of languages . '

I was of an age , he said , to know my own interests . No doubt filial affection was excellent in its way , but in fact it was highly questionable whether my father was still at the Court of this German prince ; my father had stated that he meant to visit England to obtain an interview with his son , and I might miss him by a harum - scarum chase over Germany . And besides , was I not offending my grandfather and my aunt , to whom I owed so much ? He appealed to my warmest feelings on their behalf . This was just the moment , he said , when there was a turning - point in my fortunes . He could assure me most earnestly that I should do no good by knocking at this prince 's doors , and have nothing but bitterness if I did in the end discover my father . '

Clara Goodwin besought me in a surprising manner to accompany her to England , called herself Peribanou , and with that name conjured up my father to my eyes in his breathing form . She said , as her father had done , that I was called on now to decide upon my future : she had a presentiment that evil would come to me of my unchecked , headstrong will , which she dignified by terming it a true but reckless affection : she believed she had been thrown in my path to prove herself a serviceable friend , a Peribanou of twenty - six who would not expect me to marry her when she had earned my gratitude .

We rounded the rocky corner of the gorge at a slightly accelerated pace in dead silence . It opened out to restorative daylight , and we breathed better and chaffed one another , and , beholding a house with pendent gold grapes , applauded the diligence conductor 's expressive pantomime . The opportunity was offered for a draught of wine , but we held water preferable , so we toasted the Priscilla out of the palms of our hands in draughts of water from a rill that had the sound of aspen - leaves , such as I used to listen to in the Riversley meadows , pleasantly familiar . Several commanding elevations were in sight , some wooded , some bare . We chose the nearest , to observe the sunset , and concurred in thinking it unlike English sunsets , though not so very unlike the sunset we had taken for sunrise on board the Priscilla . A tumbled , dark and light green country of swelling forest - land and slopes of meadow ran to the West , and the West from flaming yellow burned down to smoky crimson across it . Temple bade me '
69466	69639	69796	69796	Bett	419	' A glance at the sun 's disc confirmed the truth of his observation . Gazing on the outline of the orb , one might have fancied oneself in England . Yet the moment it had sunk under the hill this feeling of ours vanished with it . The coloured clouds drew me ages away from the recollection of home . A tower on a distant hill , white among pines , led us to suppose that Sarkeld must lie somewhere beneath it . We therefore descended straight toward the tower , instead of returning to the road , and struck confidently into a rugged path . Recent events had given me the assurance that in my search for my father I was subject to a special governing direction . I had aimed at the Bench missed it been shipped across sea and precipitated into the arms of friends who had seen him and could tell me I was on his actual track , only blindly , and no longer blindly now . '
69644	69656	69796	69796	Bett	419	' I said , when Temple wanted to have a consultation . '
69665	69677	69796	69796	Bett	419	' said he , with some gloom . But my retort : '
69685	69763	69796	69796	Bett	419	' was a silencer . Dark night came on . Every height stood for a ruin in our eyes , every dip an abyss . It grew bewilderingly dark , but the path did not forsake us , and we expected , at half - hour intervals , to perceive the lights of Sarkeld , soon to be thundering at one of the inns for admission and supper . I could hear Temple rehearsing his German vocabulary , '
69774	69784	69785	69785	Brod	418	' as we stumbled along . Then it fell to '
69791	69795	69785	69785	Brod	418	' and then , '
69797	69947	69948	69948	Robbers	2771	' by itself , his confession of fatigue . Our path had frequently the nature of a waterway , and was very fatiguing , more agreeable to mount than descend , for in mounting the knees and shins bore the brunt of it , and these sufferers are not such important servants of the footfarer as toes and ankles in danger of tripping and being turned . I was walking on leveller ground , my head bent and eyes half - shut , when a flash of light in a brook at my feet caused me to look aloft . The tower we had marked after sunset was close above us , shining in a light of torches . We adopted the sensible explanation of this mysterious sight , but were rather in the grip of the superstitious absurd one , until we discerned a number of reddened men . '
69950	69961	69948	69948	Robbers	2771	' exclaimed one of us . Our common thought was , '
69974	70198	69785	69785	Brod	418	' ; and we were emboldened to mount and request their help . Fronting the tower , which was of white marble , a high tent had been pitched on a green platform semicircled by pines . Torches were stuck in clefts of the trees , or in the fork of the branches , or held by boys and men , and there were clearly men at work beneath the tent at a busy rate . We could hear the paviour 's breath escape from them . Outside the ring of torchbearers and others was a long cart with a dozen horses harnessed to it . All the men appeared occupied too much for chatter and laughter . What could be underneath the tent ? Seeing a boy occasionally lift one of the flapping corners , we took licence from his example to appease our curiosity . It was the statue of a bronze horse rearing spiritedly . The workmen were engaged fixing its pedestal in the earth . Our curiosity being satisfied , we held debate upon our immediate prospects . The difficulty of making sure of a bed when you are once detached from your home , was the philosophical reflection we arrived at , for nothing practical presented itself . To arm ourselves we pulled out Miss Goodwin 's paper . '
70204	70208	69785	69785	Brod	418	' cried Temple . '
70229	70259	70260	70260	Morgen	420	' We asked several of the men . Those in motion shot a stare at us ; the torchbearers pointed at the tent and at an unseen height , muttering '
70262	70415	70416	70416	He	2775	' Referring to Miss Goodwin 's paper we discovered this to signify the unintelligible word morning , which was no answer at all ; but the men , apparently deeming our conduct suspicious , gave us to understand by rather menacing gestures that we were not wanted there , so we passed into the dusk of the trees , angry at their incivility . Had it been Summer we should have dropped and slept . The night air of a sharp season obliged us to keep active , yet we were not willing to get far away from the torches . But after a time they were hidden ; then we saw one moving ahead . The holder of it proved to be a workman of the gang , and between us and him the strangest parley ensued . He repeated the word morgen , and we insisted on zimmer and bett . '
70424	70428	70420	70422	twin Caspar Hausers	421	' sighed Temple . '
70431	70582	70583	70583	Mutter	422	' said the man , and , perhaps enlightened by hearing a foreign tongue , beckoned for us to step at his heels . His lodging was a woodman 's hut . He offered us bread to eat , milk to drink , and straw to lie on : we desired nothing more , and were happy , though the bread was black , the milk sour , the straw mouldy . Our breakfast was like a continuation of supper , but two little girls of our host , whose heads were cased in tight - fitting dirty linen caps , munched the black bread and drank the sour milk so thankfully , while fixing solemn eyes of wonder upon us , that to assure them we were the same sort of creature as themselves we pretended to relish the stuff . Rather to our amazement we did relish it . '
70585	70619	70620	70620	Doctor	2777	' I said to them . They pointed to the room overhead . Temple laid his cheek on his hand . One of the little girls laid hers on the table . I said '
70622	70627	70628	70628	Princess	2778	' They nodded and answered '
70630	71076	70628	70628	Princess	2778	' which seemed perfectly good English , and sent our conjectures as to the state of their mother 's health astray . I shut a silver English coin in one of their fat little hands . We now , with the name Sarkeld , craved of their father a direction to that place . At the door of his but he waved his hand carelessly South for Sarkeld , and vigorously West where the tower stood , then swept both hands up to the tower , bellowed a fire of cannon , waved his hat , and stamped and cheered . Temple , glancing the way of the tower , performed on a trumpet of his joined fists to show we understood that prodigious attractions were presented by the tower ; we said ja and ja , and nevertheless turned into the Sarkeld path . Some minutes later the sound of hoofs led us to imagine he had despatched a messenger after us . A little lady on a pony , attended by a tawny - faced great square - shouldered groom on a tall horse , rode past , drew up on one side , and awaited our coming . She was dressed in a grey riding - habit and a warm winter - jacket of gleaming grey fur , a soft white boa loose round her neck , crossed at her waist , white gauntlets , and a pretty black felt hat with flowing rim and plume . There she passed as under review . It was a curious scene : the iron - faced great - sized groom on his bony black charger dead still : his mistress , a girl of about eleven or twelve or thirteen , with an arm bowed at her side , whip and reins in one hand , and slips of golden brown hair straying on her flushed cheek ; rocks and trees , high silver firs rising behind her , and a slender water that fell from the rocks running at her pony 's feet . Half - a - dozen yards were between the charger 's head and the pony 's flanks . She waited for us to march by , without attempting to conceal that we were the objects of her inspection , and we in good easy swing of the feet gave her a look as we lifted our hats . That look was to me like a net thrown into moonlighted water : it brought nothing back but broken lights of a miraculous beauty . Burning to catch an excuse for another look over my shoulder , I heard her voice : '
71081	71124	71125	71125	I	0	' We turned sharp round . It was she without a doubt who had addressed us : she spurred her pony to meet us , stopped him , and said with the sweetest painful attempt at accuracy in pronouncing a foreign tongue : '
71133	71152	71125	71125	I	0	' Our hats flew off again , and bareheaded , I seized the reply before Temple could speak . '
71167	71177	71180	71180	one	795	' She gathered up her knowledge of English deliberately . '
71225	71226	71202	71202	I	0	' '
71250	71251	71248	71248	mademoiselle	2784	' '

71338	71339	71328	71328	You	2779	' '
71449	71502	71503	71503	I	0	' Temple thanked her for the kindness of the offer . I was hesitating , half conscious of surprise that I should ever be hesitating in doubt of taking the direction toward my father . Hearing Temple 's boldness I thanked her also , and accepted . Then she said , bowing : '
71511	71544	71505	71505	you	2779	' We passed the huge groom bolt upright on his towering horse ; he raised two fingers to the level of his eyebrows in the form of a salute . Temple murmured : '
71554	71617	71545	71545	I	0	' just as after our interview with Captain Bulsted he had wished to enter the British Navy . This was no more than a sign that he was highly pleased . For my part delight fluttered the words in my mouth , so that I had to repeat half I uttered to the attentive ears of our gracious new friend and guide : '
71620	71624	71545	71545	I	0	' she said , '
71717	71724	71726	71726	I.	0	' Bella Vista , lovely view , '
71727	71731	71732	71732	she	2800	' Lovely view , '
71751	71757	71735	71735	She	2800	' And see my little pensioners '
72253	72263	72241	72241	I	0	' I said it would be a fine sight . '

72388	72406	72407	72407	she	2829	' Because , of love is not much in de family in England , it is said , '
72426	72436	72407	72407	she	2829	' His name , mademoiselle , is Mr. Richmond . '
72437	72441	72380	72380	She	2829	' Mr. Richmond ? '
72442	72447	72407	72407	she	2829	' Mr. Richmond Roy . '
72454	72469	72448	72448	She	2829	' You are son to Mr. Richmond Roy ? Oh ! it is wonderful . '
72470	72480	72380	72380	She	2829	' Mademoiselle , then you have seen him lately ? '
72481	72507	72508	72508	She	2829	' Yes , yes ! I have seen him . I have heard of his beautiful child , his son ; and you it is ? '
72515	72523	72508	72508	She	2829	' Tell me , is he well ? '
72531	72532	72508	72508	She	2829	' '
72537	72556	72508	72508	She	2829	' she answered , and broke into smiles of merriment , and then seemed to bite her underlip . '
72605	72768	72769	72769	You	2838	' She put her pony to a canter up the brown path between the fir - trees , crying that she should take our breath ; but we were tight runners , and I , though my heart beat wildly , was full of fire to reach the tower on the height ; so when she slackened her pace , finding us close on her pony 's hoofs , she laughed and called us brave boys . Temple 's being no more than my friend , who had made the expedition with me out of friendship , surprised her . Not that she would not have expected it to be done by Germans ; further she was unable to explain her astonishment . At a turning of the ascent she pointed her whip at the dark knots and lines of the multitude mounting by various paths to behold the ceremony of unveiling the monument . I besought her to waste no time . '
72785	72793	72781	72781	I	0	' she said , tossing her chin . '
72808	72814	72798	72798	I	0	' said I. She answered : '
72826	72831	72815	72815	You	2838	' So we moved forward .
73028	73033	73006	73006	she	2856	' This is glorious ! '
73254	73261	73262	73262	I	0	' There he is , then ! '
73338	73359	73333	73333	I	0	' I wonder whether she says in her German , " It is my question " ; do you remember ? '
73378	73401	73402	73402	she	2842	' Nowhere . He is nowhere , and nobody knows . He will arrive . But he is not yet . Now , '
73409	73488	73402	73402	she	2842	' can you not a few words of German ? Only a smallest sum ! It is the Markgrafin , my good aunt , would speak wid you , and she can no English - only she is eager to behold you , and come ! You will know , for my sake , some scrap of German ja ? You will nicht wahr ? Or French ? Make your glom - pudding of it , will you ? '
73649	73666	73631	73631	her	2880	' C'est peut - etre le fils de son petit papa , et c'est tout dire . '

73710	73748	73679	73679	she	2880	' There was no helping it : I laughed like a madman , giving one outburst and a dead stop . Far from looking displeased , she nodded . I was again put to the dreadful test . '
73751	73753	73679	73679	she	2880	' mak '
73756	73767	73750	73750	yo	2887	' It spurred my wits . I had no speech to '

73981	74042	73963	73963	I	0	're as out of place here as frogs in the desert ! Riding to and fro , and chattering , and commotion , of which the margravine was the centre , went on , and the band played beautiful waltzes . The workmen in and out of the tent were full of their business , like seamen under a storm . '
74046	74099	73963	73963	I	0	' the margravine called . I hoped it might be an English name . So it proved to be ; and the delight of hearing English spoken , and , what was more , having English ears to speak to , was blissful as the leap to daylight out of a nightmare . '
74109	74194	74100	74100	I	0	' said a lady , English all over to our struggling senses . We became immediately attached to her as a pair of shipwrecked boats lacking provender of every sort are taken in tow by a well - stored vessel . She knew my father , knew him intimately . I related all I had to tell , and we learnt that we had made acquaintance with her pupil , the Princess Ottilia Wilhelmina Frederika Hedwig , only child of the Prince of Eppenwelzen . '
74224	74261	74215	74216	the margravine	2880	' said Miss Sibley , and conversed with the margravine ; after which she informed me that she had been graciously directed to assure me my father would be on the field when the cannon sounded . '
74270	74274	74263	74263	you	2903	' she resumed . '
74388	74389	74383	74383	she	2880	' '
74397	74401	74383	74383	she	2880	' I groaned . '
74413	74418	74403	74403	they	2918	' exclaimed Miss Sibley . '
74533	74885	74530	74530	he	2912	'm speaking now of the existing Prince Ernest that it would be ages before the statue was completed . One day the margravine induced him to agree to pay the sum stipulated for by the sculptor , on condition of the statue being completed for public inspection within eight days of the hour of their agreement . The whole Court was witness to it . They arranged for the statue , horse and man , to be exhibited for a quarter of an hour . Of course , the margravine did not signify it would be a perfectly finished work . We are kept at a great distance , that we may not scrutinize it too closely . They unveil it to show she has been as good as her word , and then cover it up to fix the rider to the horse , a screw is employed , I imagine . For one thing we know about it , we know that the horse and the horseman travelled hither separately . In all probability , the margravine gave the order for the statue last autumn in Berlin . Now look at the prince . He has his eye on you . Look down . Now he has forgotten you . He is impatient to behold the statue . Our chief fear is that the statue will not maintain its balance . Fortunately , we have plenty of guards to keep the people from pushing against it . If all turns out well , I shall really say the margravine has done wonders . She does not look anxious ; but then she is not one ever to show it . The prince does . Every other minute he is glancing at the tent and at his watch . Can you guess my idea ? Your father 's absence leads me to think - oh ! only a passing glimmer of an idea the statue has not arrived , and he is bringing it on . Otherwise , he would be sure to be here . The margravine beckons me . '
74886	74891	74892	74892	we	2927	' Do n't go ! '
74903	74922	74923	74923	she	432	' I have sent to our stables for two little pretty Hungarian horses for you two to ride , '
74926	75003	74923	74923	she	432	' No , I have not yet seen him . He is asked for , and de Markgrafin knows not at all . He bades in our lake ; he has been seen since . The man is exciteable ; but he is so sensible . Oh , no . And he is full of laughter . We shall soon see him . Would he not ever be cautious of himself for a son like you ? '
75045	75062	75040	75040	Temple	448	' We 'll give the old statue a British cheer , wo n't we , Richie ? '
75063	75072	75074	75074	I	0	' After coming all the way from England ! '
75079	75087	75074	75074	I	0	' No , no , Richie ; you 're
75131	75173	75125	75129	a fellow with a match	2931	' We saw the cannonier march up to the margravine 's carriage for orders . She summoned the prince to her side . Ladies in a dozen carriages were standing up , handkerchief in hand , and the gentlemen got their horses '
75206	75301	75302	75302	she	433	' The gun - horror has been commanded . Now then : the prince can scarcely contain himself . The gunner is ready near his gun ; he has his frightful match lifted . See , the manager - superintendent is receiving the margravine 's last injunctions . How firm women 's nerves are ! Now the margravine insists on the prince 's reading the exact time by her watch . Everybody is doing it . Let us see . By my watch it is all but fifteen minutes to eleven , A.M. Dearest , '
75308	75323	75302	75302	she	433	' would you not like to hold my hand until the gun is fired ? '
75324	75327	75329	75330	the princess	2937	' Dearest , '
75343	75357	75329	75330	the princess	2937	' if I would hold a hand it would be a gentleman 's . '
75487	75505	75507	75508	Miss Sibley	433	' It is life - like ! it is really noble ! it is a true Prince ! '
75769	75910	75762	75762	I	0	' Ja , ja to her English . We were drawn by her to congratulate the margravine , whose hand was then being kissed by the prince : he did it most courteously and affectionately . Other gentlemen , counts and barons , bowed over her hand . Ladies , according to their rank and privileges , saluted her on the cheek or in some graceful fashion . When our turn arrived , Miss Sibley translated for us , and as we were at concert pitch we did not acquit ourselves badly . Temple 's remark was , that he wished she and all her family had been English . Nothing was left for me to say but that the margravine almost made us wish we had been German . Smiling cordially , the margravine spoke , Miss Sibley translated : '
75923	75934	75911	75913	Her Royal Highness	2958	' I shook my head . The Princess Ottilia translated , '
75955	75956	75946	75946	you	2959	' '
75961	75974	75946	75946	you	2959	' I cried . The margravine pushed me back with a gesture . '
75988	76057	75977	75978	your Highness	9692	' She declined to hear the translation . Her insulting disbelief in my ability to recognize the father I had come so far to embrace would have vexed me but for the wretched thought that I was losing him again . We threaded the carriages ; gazed at the horsemen in a way to pierce the hair on their faces . The little princess came on us hurriedly . '
76078	76082	76083	76083	I	0	' She whispered , '
76114	76147	76105	76106	de Markgrafin	426	' We mounted simply to show that we could mount , for we would rather have been on foot , and drew up close to the right of the margravine 's carriage . '
76157	76162	76150	76151	a poet	1208	' said the princess . '
76170	76254	76165	76168	Count Fretzel von Wolfenstein	437	' This ode was dreadful to us , and all the Court people pretended they liked it . When he waved his right hand toward the statue there was a shout from the rustic set ; when he bowed to the margravine , the ladies and gentlemen murmured agreeably and smiled . We were convinced of its being downright hypocrisy , rustic stupidity , Court flattery . We would have argued our case , too . I proposed a gallop ; Temple said , '
76303	76418	76419	76419	Father	9774	' We could not imagine why they should have poetry read out to them instead of their fine band playing , but supposed it was for the satisfaction of the margravine , with whom I grew particularly annoyed on hearing Miss Sibley say she conceived her Highness to mean that my father was actually on the ground , and that we neither of us , father and son , knew one another . I swore on my honour , on my life , he was not present ; and the melancholy in my heart taking the form of extreme irritation , I spoke passionately . I rose in my stirrups , ready to shout , '
76434	76444	76423	76424	Harry Richmond	244	' I did utter something a syllable or two : '
76448	76500	76501	76501	Her	2974	' I think the words were . They sprang from my inmost bosom , addressed without forethought to that drawling mouthing poet . The margravine 's face met mine like a challenge . She had her lips tight in a mere lip - smile , and her eyes gleamed with provocation . '
76504	76509	76501	76502	Her Highness	2961	' Miss Sibley translated , '
76526	76527	76529	76529	her	2974	' '
76545	76652	76653	76653	Richie	448	' said I. Temple took one half the circle , I the other , riding through the attentive horsemen and carriage - lines , and making sure the face we sought was absent , more or less discomposing everybody . The poet finished his ode ; he was cheered , of course . Mightily relieved , I beheld the band resuming their instruments , for the cheering resembled a senseless beating on brass shields . I felt that we English could do it better . Temple from across the sector of the circle , running about two feet in front of the statue , called aloud , '
76660	76661	76655	76655	he	1098	' '
76665	76682	76683	76683	Richie	448	' cried I. The people gazed up at us , wondering at the tongue we talked . '
76697	76785	76683	76683	Richie	448	' Little Temple crowed lustily . The head of the statue turned from Temple to me . I found the people falling back with amazed exclamations . I so prepossessed was I simply stared at the sudden - flashing white of the statue 's eyes . The eyes , from being an instant ago dull carved balls , were animated . They were fixed on me . I was unable to give out a breath . Its chest heaved ; both bronze hands struck against the bosom . '
76799	77067	76796	76797	Richmond Roy	429	' That was what the statue gave forth . My head was like a ringing pan . I knew it was my father , but my father with death and strangeness , earth , metal , about him ; and his voice was like a human cry contending with earth and metal - mine was stifled . I saw him descend . I dismounted . We met at the ropes and embraced . All his figure was stiff , smooth , cold . My arms slid on him . Each time he spoke I thought it an unnatural thing : I myself had not spoken once . After glancing by hazard at the empty saddle of the bronze horse , I called to mind more clearly the appalling circumstance which had stupefied the whole crowd . They had heard a statue speak had seen a figure of bronze walk . For them it was the ancestor of their prince ; it was the famous dead old warrior of a hundred and seventy years ago set thus in motion . Imagine the behaviour of people round a slain tiger that does not compel them to fly , and may yet stretch out a dreadful paw ! Much so they pressed for a nearer sight of its walnut visage , and shrank in the act . Perhaps I shared some of their sensations . I can not tell : my sensations were tranced . There was no warmth to revive me in the gauntlet I clasped . I looked up at the sky , thinking that it had fallen dark .
77873	77887	77866	77866	Temple	448	' And there was your father apologizing , and the margravine rating him , '
78054	78065	78066	78067	my father	925	' You have seen the last of me , madam , '

78307	78433	78434	78435	Mr. Temple	448	' We were conscious that his thick case of varnished clothing was against us . One would have fancied from his way of speaking that he suffered from asthma . I was now gifted with a tenfold power of observation , and let nothing escape me . Temple , sitting opposite , grinned cheerfully at times to encourage our spirits ; he had not recovered from his wonderment , nor had I introduced him . My father , however , had caught his name . Temple who might as well have talked , I thought was perpetually stealing secret glances of abstracted perusal at him with a pair of round infant 's eyes , sucking his reflections the while . My father broke our silence . '
78442	78452	78434	78435	Mr. Temple	448	' he said , as if about to cough ; '
78473	78535	78538	78539	Mr. Temple	448	' Temple started and reddened like a little fellow detected in straying from his spelling - book , which was the window - frame . In a minute or so the fascination proved too strong for him ; his eyes wandered from the window and he renewed his shy inspection bit by bit as if casting up a column of figures . '
78547	78630	78538	78539	Mr. Temple	448	' said my father . It must have cost Temple cruel pain , for he was a thoroughly gentlemanly boy , and he could not resist it . Finally he surprised himself in his stealthy reckoning : arrived at the full - breech or buttoned waistband , about half - way up his ascent from the red silk stocking , he would pause and blink rapidly , sometimes jump and cough . To put him at his ease , my father exclaimed , '
78636	78647	78648	78648	I	0	' he knocked his knuckles on the heaving hard surface , '
78724	78734	78735	78735	I	0	' He begged permission to take breath a minute . '
78820	78979	78784	78784	you	0	' His speaking in such a strain , out of pure kindness to Temple , huskily , with his painful attempt to talk like himself , revived his image as the father of my heart and dreams , and stirred my torpid affection , though it was still torpid enough , as may be imagined , when I state that I remained plunged in contemplation of his stocking of red silk emerging from the full bronzed breech , considering whether his comparison of himself to a shell - fish might not be a really just one . We neither of us regained our true natures until he was free of every vestige of the garb of Prince Albrecht Wohlgemuth . Attendants were awaiting him at the garden - gate of a beautiful villa partly girdled by rising fir - woods on its footing of bright green meadow . They led him away , and us to bath - rooms .

How blithely he flung out his limbs and heaved his chest released from confinement ! His face was stained brownish , but we drank old Rhine wine , and had no eye for appearances . '
79117	79140	79115	79115	Richie	448	' My father interrupted the narrative I doled out , anxious for his , and he began , and I interrupted him . '

79166	79197	79164	79164	you	0	' he sighed . I gave him the account of my latest adventures in a few panting breaths , suppressing the Bench . He set my face to front him . '

80834	80901	80902	80902	My	0	' Tis the fashion with the Germans . I promise you good wine shall make it up to you for the return to school - habits . We sup , and we pack our scanty baggage , and we start tonight . Brook no insult at Courts if you are of material value : if not , it is unreservedly a question whether you like kickings . '
80930	81340	80927	80927	he	925	' Dear lads , I have fallen into the custom of the country ; I crave your permission that I may smoke . Wander , if you choose , within hail of me , or sit by me , if you can bear it , and talk of your school - life , and your studies . Your aunt Dorothy , Richie ? She is well ? I know not her like . I could bear to hear of any misfortune but that she suffered pain . My father smoked his cigar peacefully . He had laid a guitar on his knees , and flipped a string , or chafed over all the strings , and plucked and thrummed them as his mood varied . We chatted , and watched the going down of the sun , and amused ourselves idly , fermenting as we were . Anything that gave pleasure to us two boys pleased and at once occupied my father . It was without aid from Temple 's growing admiration of him that I recovered my active belief and vivid delight in his presence . My younger days sprang up beside me like brothers . No one talked , looked , flashed , frowned , beamed , as he did ! had such prompt liveliness as he ! such tenderness ! No one was ever so versatile in playfulness . He took the colour of the spirits of the people about him . His vivacious or sedate man - of - the - world tone shifted to playfellow 's fun in a twinkling . I used as a little fellow to think him larger than he really was , but he was of good size , inclined to be stout ; his eyes were grey , rather prominent , and his forehead sloped from arched eyebrows . So conversational were his eyes and brows that he could persuade you to imagine he was carrying on a dialogue without opening his mouth . His voice was charmingly clear ; his laughter confident , fresh , catching , the outburst of his very self , as laughter should be . Other sounds of laughter were like echoes . Strange to say , I lost the links of my familiarity with him when he left us on a short visit to his trunks and portmanteaux , and had to lean on Temple , who tickled but rejoiced me by saying : '
81357	81417	81349	81349	I	0	' We thought it a pity to have to leave this nice foreign place immediately . I liked the scenery , and the wine , and what I supposed to be the habit of the gentlemen here to dress in silks . On my father 's return to us I asked him if we could not stay till morning . '
81423	81427	81349	81349	I	0	' he said : '
81436	81531	81349	81349	I	0	' His complexion was ruddier ; his valet had been at work to restore it ; he was getting the sanguine hue which coloured my recollection of him . Wearing a black velvet cap and a Spanish furred cloak , he led us over the villa . In Sarkeld he resided at the palace , and generally at the lake - palace on the removal of the Court thither . The margravine had placed the villa , which was her own property , at his disposal , the better to work out their conspiracy . '
81538	81553	81349	81349	I	0	' said my father , bending suddenly to my ear , and humming his philosophical '
81556	81634	81349	81349	I	0	' as he stepped on in minuet fashion . We went through apartments rich with gilded oak and pine panellings : in one was a rough pattern of a wooden horse opposite a mirror ; by no means a figure of a horse , but apparently a number of pieces contributed by a carpenter 's workshop , having a rueful seat in the middle . My father had practised the attitude of Prince Albrecht Wohlgemuth on it . '
81646	81705	81635	81635	She	3125	' he said ; and he now supposed he had sat the bronze horse as a statue in public view exactly thirty - seven minutes and a quarter . Tubs full of colouring liquid to soak the garments of the prince , pots of paint , and paint and plaster brushes , hinted the magnitude of the preparations . '
81708	81716	81717	81717	I	0	' said my father in another apartment , '

82032	82052	82030	82030	Richie	448	' my father opened a side - door out of an elegant little room into a spacious dark place , '
82091	82095	82096	82096	He	0	' tis over . '

What I thought of her , how she looked at me , what I said to her , what words she answered , how the acquaintance began , who were observers of it , I had to repair my omission to mention her by furnishing a precise description of the circumstances , describing her face and style , repeating her pretty English . My father nodded : he thought I exaggerated that foreign English of hers ; but , as I said , I was new to it and noticed it . He admitted the greater keenness of attention awakened by novelty . '
82312	82316	82124	82124	he	0	' said he , '
82320	82333	82334	82334	he	0	' and here he smiled at me inquiringly . " Tis true , '
82337	82503	82334	82334	he	0	' a boy of fourteen or fifteen ay , Richie , have your fun out . A youngster saw the comic side of her . Do you know , that child has a remarkable character ? Her disposition is totally unfathomable . You are a deep reader of English poetry , I hope ; she adores it , and the English Navy . She informed me that if she had been the English people she would have made Nelson king . The Royal family of England might see objections to that , I told her . Cries she : " Oh ! anything for a sea - hero . " You will find these young princes and princesses astonishingly revolutionary when they entertain brains . Now at present , just at present , an English naval officer , and a poet , stand higher in the esteem of that young Princess Ottilia than dukes , kings , or emperors . So you have seen her ! '
82515	82602	82334	82334	he	0	' By the way , we must be careful not to offend our grandpapa Beltham , Richie . Good acres good anchorage ; good coffers good harbourage . Regarding poetry , my dear boy , you ought to be writing it , for I do the diversion of leisure hours , impromptus . In poetry , I would scorn anything but impromptus . I was saying , Richie , that if tremendous misfortune withholds from you your legitimate prestige , you must have the substantial element . '
82624	82635	82636	82636	I	0	' Tis the essence if you have not the odour . '

83390	83407	83379	83380	your Highness	9692	' Temple was dazed by this mystifying address to him ; nor could I understand it . '
83422	83425	83412	83412	you	8099	' said I. '
83429	83433	83426	83426	I	0	' he replied , '
83459	83500	83501	83502	The cricketer	3187	' He kissed his wafting finger - tips . We fell upon our random talk again with a merry rattle . I had to give him a specimen of my piano - playing and singing . He shook his head . '
83528	83630	83633	83633	Richie	448	' Late at night we separated . Temple and I slept in companion - rooms . Deadly drowsy , the dear little fellow sat on the edge of my bed chattering of his wonder . My dreams led me wandering with a ship 's diver under the sea , where we walked in a light of pearls and exploded old wrecks . I was assuring the glassy man that it was almost as clear beneath the waves as above , when I awoke to see my father standing over me in daylight ; and in an ecstasy I burst into sobs . '
83634	83642	83633	83633	Richie	448	' he pressed fresh violets on my nostrils '
83666	83702	83646	83648	a morning visitor	3191	' I leapt to the window in time to have in view the little Princess Ottilia , followed by her faithful gaunt groom , before she was lost in the shadow of the fir - trees .

83856	83941	83942	83942	he	3198	' you may not know and it is not to win your thanks I inform you of it that I labour unremittingly in my son 's interests . I have established him , on his majority , in Germany , at a Court . My object now is to establish him in England . Promise me that it shall be the decided endeavour of your energies and talents to rise to the height I point out to you ? You promise , I perceive , '
84110	84116	84118	84118	he	3198	' Now , for instance , '
84120	84313	84118	84118	he	3198	' what is my desire at this moment ? I have always a big one perched on a rock in the distance ; but I speak of my present desire . And let it be supposed that the squire is one of us : we are returning to England . Well , I want to show you a stork 's nest . We are not far enough South for the stork to build here . It is a fact , Richie , that I do want to show you the bird for luck , and as a feature of the country . And in me , a desire to do a thing partakes of the impetus of steam . Well , you see we are jogging home to England . I resist myself for duty 's sake : that I can do . But if the squire were here with his yea and his nay , by heavens ! I should be off to the top of the Rhine like a tornado . I submit to circumstances : I can not , and I will not , be dictated to by men . '
84314	84322	84323	84323	I	0	' That seems to me rather unreasonable , '
84326	84336	84337	84337	he	3207	' It is ; I am ashamed of it , '
84340	84421	84337	84337	he	3207	' Do as you will , Richie ; set me down at Riversley , but under no slight , mark you . I keep my honour intact , like a bottled cordial ; my unfailing comfort in adversity ! I hand it to you , my son , on my death - bed , and say , " You have there the essence of my life . Never has it been known of me that I swallowed an insult . " '
84422	84436	84118	84118	he	3198	' Then , papa , I shall have a talk with the squire . '
84437	84446	84448	84448	he	3208	' Make good your ground in the castle , '
84450	84583	84448	84448	he	3208	' I string a guitar outside . You toss me a key from the walls . If there is room , and I have leisure , I enter . If not , you know I am paving your way in other quarters . Riversley , my boy , is an excellent foothold and fortress : Riversley is not the world . At Riversley I should have to wear a double face , and , egad ! a double stomach - bag , like young Jack feeding with the giant one full of ambition , the other of provender . That place is our touchstone to discover whether we have prudence . We have , I hope . And we will have , Mr. Temple , a pleasant day or two in Paris . '

85251	85305	85248	85249	my father	925	' One is glad , Richie , to fill a creature out of one 's emptiness . Now she toddles ; she is digesting it rapidly . The last performance of one 's purse is rarely so pleasant as that . I owe it to her that I made the discovery in time . '
85841	85857	85858	85858	he	925	' The poet is perhaps , on the whole , more exhilarating than the alderman , '

85892	85990	85890	85890	he	925	' but for all that the alderman is lighter on his feet : I back him to be across the Channel first . The object of my instructions to you will be lost , Richie , if I find you despising the Alderman 's Pegasus . On money you mount . We are literally chained here , you know , there is no doubt about it ; and we are adding a nail to our fetters daily . True , you are accomplishing the Parisian accent . Paris has also this immense advantage over all other cities : '
86035	86094	86139	86141	Richie Mr. Temple	448	' A meeting with a friend of my father , Mr. Monterez Williams , was the result of our resolute adoption of this system . He helped us on to Boulogne , where my father met another friend , to whom he gave so sumptuous a dinner that we had not money enough to pay the hotel bill . '
86103	86107	86139	86141	Richie Mr. Temple	448	' said he . '
86174	86360	86143	86143	I	0	' I proposed to write to my aunt Dorothy for money , but he would not hear of that . After two or three days of whistling , I saw my old friend , Mr. Bannerbridge , step out of the packetboat . On condition of my writing to my aunt to say that I was coming home , he advanced me the sum we were in need of , grudgingly though , and with the prediction that we should break down again , which was verified . It occurred only a stage from Riversley , where my grandfather 's name was good as coin of the realm . Besides , my father remained at the inn to guarantee the payment of the bill , while Temple and I pushed on in a fly with the two dozen of Hock . It could hardly be called a break - down , but my father was not unwilling for me to regard it in that light . Among his parting remarks was an impressive adjuration to me to cultivate the squire 's attachment at all costs . '
86364	86368	86143	86143	I	0	' he said , '
86548	86704	86705	86705	We	3274	' Thus he sped me forward . We sighted Riversley about mid - day on a sunny June morning . Compared with the view from Bella Vista , our firs looked scanty , our heath - tracts dull , as places having no page of history written on them , our fresh green meadows not more than commonly homely . I was so full of my sense of triumph in my adventurous journey and the recovery of my father , that I gazed on the old Grange from a towering height . The squire was on the lawn , surrounded by a full company : the Ilchesters , the Ambroses , the Wilfords , Captain and Squire Gregory Bulsted , the Rubreys , and others , all bending to roses , to admire , smell , or pluck . Charming groups of ladies were here and there ; and Temple whispered as we passed them : '
86714	86728	86712	86712	Richie	448	' I , making it my business to talk with perfect unconcern , replied '
86740	86780	86712	86712	Richie	448	' ; all the while I was exulting at the sweet beams of England radiating from these dear early - morning - looking women . My aunt Dorothy swam up to me , and , kissing me , murmured : '
86790	86795	86788	86788	darling	3278	' My answer was : '
86801	86880	86881	86881	Hulloa	383	' Captain Bulsted sang out our names ; I caught sight of Julia Rippenger 's face ; the squire had his back turned to me , which reminded me of my first speech with Captain Jasper Welsh , and I thought to myself , I know something of the world now , and the thing is to keep a good temper . Here there was no wire - coil to intercept us , so I fronted him quickly . '
86883	86893	86881	86881	Hulloa	383	' he cried , and gave me his shoulder . '
86901	86933	86894	86894	Temple	448	' said I. He was obliged to stretch out his hand to Temple . A prompt instinct warned me that I must show him as much Beltham as I could summon . '
86942	86951	86940	86940	sir	7975	' I asked . Captain Bulsted sauntered near . '

88734	89242	88720	88720	She	3346	' and that was the only true thing she spoke of the days to come . Owing to the hubbub around the two who were guilty of this unmeasured joke upon consequential ladies , I had to conduct her to the gate . Instantly , and without a good - bye , she scrambled up her skirts and ran at strides across the road and through the wood , out of sight . She won her dress and a piece of jewelry . With Heriot I went on a sad expedition , the same I had set out upon with Temple . This time I saw my father behind those high red walls , once so mysterious and terrible to me . Heriot made light of prisons for debt . He insisted , for my consolation , that they had but a temporary dishonourable signification ; very estimable gentlemen , as well as scamps , inhabited them , he said . The impression produced by my visit the feasting among ruined men who believed in good luck the more the lower they fell from it , and their fearful admiration of my imprisoned father was as if I had drunk a stupefying liquor . I was unable clearly to reflect on it . Daily afterwards , until I released him , I made journeys to usurers to get a loan on the faith of the reversion of my mother 's estate . Heriot , like the real friend he was , helped me with his name to the bond . When my father stood free , I had the proudest heart alive ; and as soon as we had parted , the most amazed . For a long while , for years , the thought of him was haunted by racketballs and bearded men in their shirtsleeves ; a scene sickening to one 's pride . Yet it had grown impossible for me to think of him without pride . I delighted to hear him . We were happy when we were together . And , moreover , he swore to me on his honour , in Mrs. Waddy 's presence , that he and the constable would henceforth keep an even pace . His exuberant cheerfulness and charming playfulness were always fascinating . His visions of our glorious future enchained me . How it was that something precious had gone out of my life , I could not comprehend . Julia Rippenger 's marriage with Captain Bulsted was , an agreeable distraction . Unfortunately for my peace of mind , she went to the altar poignantly pale . My aunt Dorothy settled the match . She had schemed it , her silence and half - downcast look seemed to confess , for the sake of her own repose , but neither to her nor to others did that come of it . I wrote a plain warning of the approaching catastrophe to Heriot , and received his reply after it was over , to this effect : '
89470	89798	89455	89455	you	448	' I presumed from this that Heriot 's passion for Julia was extinct . Aunt Dorothy disapproved of his tone , which I thought admirably philosophical and coxcombi - cally imitable , an expression of the sort of thing I should feel on hearing of Janet Ilchester 's nuptials . The daring and success of that foreign adventure of mine had , with the aid of Colonel and Clara Goodwin , convinced the squire of the folly of standing between me and him I loved . It was considered the best sign possible that he should take me down on an inspection of his various estates and his great coal - mine , and introduce me as the heir who would soon relieve him of the task . Perhaps he thought the smell of wealth a promising cure for such fits of insubordination as I had exhibited . My occasional absences on my own account were winked at . On my return the squire was sour and snappish , I cheerful and complaisant ; I grew cold , and he solicitous ; he would drink my health with a challenge to heartiness , and I drank to him heartily and he relapsed to a fit of sulks , informing me , that in his time young men knew when they were well off , and asking me whether I was up to any young men 's villanies , had any concealed debts perchance , because , if so Oh ! he knew the ways of youngsters , especially when they fell into bad hands : the list of bad titles rumbled on in an underbreath like cowardly thunder : well , to cut the matter short , because , if so , his cheque - book was at my service ; did n't I know that , eh ? Not being immediately distressed by debt , I did not exhibit the gush of gratitude , and my sedate '
89804	90296	89455	89455	you	448	' confused his appeal for some sentimental show of affection . I am sure the poor old man suffered pangs of jealousy ; I could even at times see into his breast and pity him . He wanted little more than to be managed ; but a youth when he perceives absurdity in opposition to him chafes at it as much as if he were unaware that it is laughable . Had the squire talked to me in those days seriously and fairly of my father 's character , I should have abandoned my system of defence to plead for him as before a judge . By that time I had gained the knowledge that my father was totally of a different construction from other men . I wished the squire to own simply to his loveable nature . I could have told him women did . Without citing my dear aunt Dorothy , or so humble a creature as the devoted Mrs. Waddy , he had sincere friends among women , who esteemed him , and were staunch adherents to his cause ; and if the widow of the City knight , Lady Sampleman , aimed openly at being something more , she was not the less his friend . Nor was it only his powerful animation , generosity , and grace that won them . There occurred when I was a little past twenty , already much in his confidence , one of those strange crucial events which try a man publicly , and bring out whatever can be said for and against him . A young Welsh heiress fell in love with him . She was , I think , seven or eight months younger than myself , a handsome , intelligent , high - spirited girl , rather wanting in polish , and perhaps in the protecting sense of decorum . She was well - born , of course she was Welsh . She was really well - bred too , though somewhat brusque . The young lady fell hopelessly in love with my father at Bath . She gave out that he was not to be for one moment accused of having encouraged her by secret addresses . It was her unsolicited avowal thought by my aunt Dorothy immodest , not by me that she preferred him to all living men . Her name was Anna Penrhys . The squire one morning received a letter from her family , requesting him to furnish them with information as to the antecedents of a gentleman calling himself Augustus Fitz - George Frederick William Richmond Guelph Roy , for purposes which would , they assured him , warrant the inquiry . He was for throwing the letter aside , shouting that he thanked his God he was unacquainted with anybody on earth with such an infernal list of names as that . Roy ! Who knew anything of Roy ? '

90366	90437	90321	90331	those blackguard adventurers who creep into families to catch the fools	3385	' the squire worked himself up to roar . He wrote a reply , the contents of which I could guess at from my aunt 's refusal to let me be present at the discussion of it . The letter despatched was written by her , with his signature . Her eyes glittered for a whole day . Then came a statement of the young lady 's case from Bath . '

95011	95023	95025	95026	Captain DeWitt	462	' What ! Have you got a place at their tables ? '
95028	95129	95133	95133	him	925	' No , I can not say that not even below the salt . Mr. Richmond Mr. Roy , you may not be aware of it : I am the proprietor of the opposition journals in this county . I tell you in confidence , one by itself would not pay ; and I am a printer , sir , and it is on my conscience to tell you I have , in the course of business , been compelled this very morning to receive orders for the printing of various squibs and , I much fear , scurrilous things .

95200	95259	95192	95193	My father	925	' Not a word , not a line ! You spoke of the eleventh hour , Mr. Hickson . If we are at all near the eleventh , I must be on my way to make my bow to Lady Wilts ; or is it Lady Denewdney 's to - night ? No , to - morrow night . '
95296	95309	95292	95293	Captain DeWitt	462	' If that 's the Fourth Estate , what 's the Realm ? '

95358	95422	95423	95423	I	0	' Jorian , I have noticed that when you are malignant you are not witty . We have to thank the man for not subjecting us to a pledge of secresy . My Lady Wilts will find the proofs amusing . And mark , I do not examine their contents before submitting them to her inspection . You will testify to the fact . '
95494	95508	95510	95511	Lady Wilts	464	' You ask too much of me : I can not turn her out '
95523	95531	95510	95511	Lady Wilts	464	' You will have to marry her . '

95956	96006	95945	95945	she	8170	' I can form no image of her . Your accounts of her are confusing . Tell me earnestly , do you like her ? She must be very wilful , but is she really nice ? I want to know how she appears to my Harry 's mind . '
96021	96038	96039	96039	His	925	' A good soul ! the best of women ! There there is a treasure lost ! '
96081	96235	96236	96236	She	3540	' Am I to understand that you , Harry , raise objections to her ? Think first whether she is in herself objectionable . She is rich , she may be prudent , she may be a forethoughtful person . She may not be able to support a bitter shock of grief . She may be one who can help . She may not be one whose heart will bear it . Put your own feelings aside , my dearest . Our duties can not ever be clear to us until we do . It is possible for headstrong wilfulness and secret tenderness to go together . Think whether she is capable of sacrifice before you compel her to it . Do not inflict misery wantonly . One would like to see her . Harry , I brood on your future ; that is why I seem to you preternaturally anxious about you . '
96266	96334	96260	96260	He	925	' Our Jorian says that women 's letters must be read like anagrams . To put it familiarly , they are like a child 's field of hop - scotch . You may have noticed the urchins at their game : a bit of tile , and a variety of compartments to pass it through to the base , hopping . Or no , Richie , pooh ! '
96426	96554	96412	96412	mother	2543	' He lost his voice . She sent me three hundred pounds ; she must have supposed the occasion pressing . Thus fortified against paternal improvidence , I expended a hundred in the purchase of a horse , and staked the remainder on him in a match , and was beaten . Disgusted with the horse , I sold him for half his purchase - money , and with that sum paid a bill to maintain my father 's credit in the town . Figuratively speaking , I looked at my hands as astonished as I had been when the poor little rascal in the street snatched my cake , and gave me the vision of him gorging it in the flurried alley of the London crowd . '
96558	96562	96412	96412	mother	2543	' I remarked . '
96574	96580	96412	96412	mother	2543	' said my father freshly ; '
96700	96701	96702	96702	I	0	' '
96716	96721	96707	96714	the last of Shylock 's great - grandnephew	3562	' said I emphatically . '
96772	97031	96770	96770	tradesmen	1394	' Thinking it so myself , I had not attempted to discover the source of my father 's income . Such as it was , it was paid half - yearly , and spent within a month of the receipt , for the most signal proof possible of its shameful insufficiency . Thus ten months of the year at least he lived protesting , and many with him , compulsorily . For two months he was a brilliant man . I penetrated his mystery enough to abstain from questioning him , and enough to determine that on my coming of age he should cease to be a pensioner , petitioner , and adventurer . He aimed at a manifest absurdity . In the meantime , after the lesson I had received as to the nature of money , I saw with some alarm my father preparing to dig a great pit for it . He had no doubt performed wonders . Despite of scandal and tattle , and the deadly report of a penniless fortune - hunter having fascinated the young heiress , he commanded an entrance to the receptions of both the rival ladies dominant . These ladies , Lady Wilts and Lady Denewdney , who moved each in her select half - circle , and could heretofore be induced by none to meet in a common centre , had pledged themselves to honour with their presence a ball he proposed to give to the choice world here assembled on a certain illuminated day of the calendar . '
97042	97181	97040	97040	Richie	448	' said he , twinkling to propitiate me , lest I should suspect him of valuing his achievements highly . He had , he continued , promised Hickson of the Fourth Estate , that he would , before leaving the place , do his utmost to revive the ancient glories of Bath : Bath had once set the fashion to the kingdom ; why not again ? I might have asked him , why at all , or why at his expense ; but his lead was irresistible . Captain DeWitt and his valet , and I , and a score of ladies , scores of tradesmen , were rushing , reluctant or not , on a torrent . My part was to show that I was an athlete , and primarily that I could fence and shoot . '
97193	97494	97495	97495	I	0	' said DeWitt . He sat writing letters incessantly . My father made the tour of his fair stewardesses from noon to three , after receiving in audience his jewellers , linen - drapers , carpenters , confectioners , from nine in the morning till twelve . At three o'clock business ceased . Workmen then applying to him for instructions were despatched to the bar of the hotel , bearing the recommendation to the barmaid not to supply them refreshment if they had ever in their lives been seen drunk . At four he dressed for afternoon parade . Nor could his enemy have said that he was not the chief voice and eye along his line of march . His tall full figure maintained a superior air without insolence , and there was a leaping beam in his large blue eyes , together with the signification of movement coming to his kindly lips , such as hardly ever failed to waken smiles of greeting . People smiled and bowed , and forgot their curiosity , forgot even to be critical , while he was in sight . I can say this , for I was acutely critical of their bearing ; the atmosphere of the place was never perfectly pleasing to me . My attitude of watchful reserve , and my reputation as the heir of immense wealth , tended possibly to constrain a certain number of the inimical party to be ostensibly civil . Lady Wilts , who did me the honour to patronize me almost warmly , complimented me on my manner of backing him , as if I were the hero ; but I felt his peculiar charm ; she partly admitted it , making a whimsical mouth , saying , in allusion to Miss Penrhys , '
97514	97831	97495	97495	I	0	' Where I served him perhaps was in showing my resolution to protect him : he had been insulted before my arrival . The male relatives of Miss Penrhys did not repeat the insult ; they went to Lady Wilts and groaned over their hard luck in not having the option of fighting me . I was , in her phrase , a new piece on the board , and checked them . Thus , if they provoked a challenge from me , they brought the destructive odour of powder about the headstrong creature 's name . I was therefore of use to him so far . I leaned indolently across the rails of the promenade while she bent and chattered in his ear , and her attendant cousin and cavalier chewed vexation in the form of a young mustachio 's curl . His horse fretted ; he murmured deep notes , and his look was savage ; but he was bound to wait on her , and she would not go until it suited her pleasure . She introduced him to me as if conversation could be carried on between two young men feeling themselves simply pieces on the board , one giving check , and the other chafing under it ! I need not say that I disliked my situation . It was worse when my father took to bowing to her from a distance , unobservant of her hand 's prompt pull at the reins as soon as she saw him . Lady Wilts had assumed the right of a woman still possessing attractions to exert her influence with him on behalf of the family , for I had done my best to convince her that he entertained no serious thought of marrying , and decidedly would not marry without my approval . He acted on her advice to discourage the wilful girl . '
97842	97866	97835	97835	I	0	' Miss Penrhys accosted me abruptly . I fancied she must have gone mad , and an interrogative frown was my sole answer . '
97878	97882	97872	97872	you	0	' she continued . '
97966	98409	97957	97957	you	0	' At a dancing party where we met , she was thrown on my hands by her ungovernable vehemence , and I , as I had told Lady Wilts , not being able to understand the liking of twenty for forty fifty would have been nearer the actual mark , or sixty , offered her no lively sympathy . I believe she had requested my father to pay public court to her . If Captain DeWitt was to be trusted , she desired him to dance , and dance with her exclusively , and so confirm and defy the tattle of the town ; but my father hovered between the dowagers . She in consequence declined to dance , which was the next worse thing she could do . An aunt , a miserable woman , was on her left ; on her right she contrived , too frequently for my peace of mind , to reserve a vacant place for me , and she eyed me intently across the room , under her persistent brows , until perforce I was drawn to her side . I had to listen to a repetition of sharp queries and replies , and affect a flattered gaiety , feeling myself most uncomfortably , as Captain DeWitt who watched us said , Chip the son of Block the father . By fixing the son beside her , she defeated the father 's scheme of coldness , and made it appear a concerted piece of policy . Even I saw that . I saw more than I grasped . Love for my father was to my mind a natural thing , a proof of taste and goodness ; women might love him ; but the love of a young girl with the morning 's mystery about her ! and for my progenitor ! a girl as I reflected in the midst of my interjections well - built , clear - eyed , animated , clever , with soft white hands and pretty feet ; how could it be ? She was sombre as a sunken fire until he at last came round to her , and then her sudden vivacity was surprising . Affairs were no further advanced when I had to obey the squire 's commands and return to Riversley , missing the night of the grand ball with no profound regret , except for my father 's sake . He wrote soon after one of his characteristic letters , to tell me that the ball had , been a success . Immediately upon this announcement , he indulged luxurious reflections , as his manner was : '
98809	99035	99036	99037	a gentleman	7983	' Miss Penrhys retires to her native Wales ; Jorian and I on to London , to the Continent . Plinlimmon guard us all ! I send you our local newspapers . That I cut entrechats is false . It happens to be a thing I could do , and not an Englishman in England except myself ; only I did not do it . I did appear in what I was educated to believe was the evening suit of a gentleman , and I can not perceive the immodesty of showing my leg . A dress that is not indecent , and is becoming to me , and is the dress of my fathers , I wear , and I impose it on the generation of my sex . However , I dined Hickson of the Fourth Estate Jorian considers him hungry enough to eat up his twentieth before he dies I forget the wording of the mot , that he might know I was without rancour in the end , as originally I had been without any intention of purchasing his allegiance . He offered me his columns ; he wished me luck with the heiress ; by his Gods , he swore he worshipped entrechats , and held a silk leg the most admirable work of the manufactures . " Sir , you 're
99045	99052	99041	99041	he	3589	're a nobleman , sir ; you 're
99057	99193	99056	99056	you	7983	're a star of the first magnitude . " Cries Jorian , " Retract that , scum ! you see nothing large but what you dare to think neighbours you , " and quarrels the inebriate dog . And this is the maker and destroyer of reputations in his day ! I study Hickson as a miraculous engine of the very simplest contrivance ; he is himself the epitome of a verdict on his period . Next day he disclaimed in his opposition penny sheet the report of the entrechats , and " the spectators laughing consumedly , " and sent me as I had requested him to do the names of his daughters , to whom I transmit little comforting presents , for if they are nice children such a parent must afflict them . '
99217	99222	99204	99204	She	464	' Hem ! madam . '
99608	99774	99604	99604	I	0	' Not to boast , darling old son , I tell truth ; I am only happy when my heart is beating near you . Here comes the mother in me pumping up . Adieu . Lebe wohl . The German ! the German ! may God in his Barmherzigkeit ! Tell her I never encouraged the girl , have literally nothing to trace a temporary wrinkle on my forehead as regards conscience . I say , may it please Providence to make you a good German scholar by the day of your majority . Hurrah for it ! Present my humble warm respects to your aunt Dorothy . I pray to heaven nightly for one of its angels on earth . Kunst , Wissenschaft , Ehre , Liebe . Die Liebe . Quick at the German poets . Frau : Fraulein . I am actually dazzled at the prospect of our future . To be candid , I no longer see to write . Gruss '
99787	99824	99604	99604	I	0	' My aunt Dorothy sent a glance at the letter while I was folding it evidently thinking my unwillingness to offer it a sign of bad news or fresh complications . She spoke of Miss Penrhys . '

99870	99903	99904	99904	He	1098	' said she softly ; and on affirming that he had uttered it and written it , she replied in the same tone , more effective than the ordinary language of conviction , '
99910	100047	99904	99904	He	1098	' The rage of a youth to prove himself in the right of an argument was insufficient to make me lay the letter out before other eyes than my own , and I shrank from exposing it to compassionate gentle eyes that would have pleaded similar allowances to mine for the wildness of the style . I should have thanked , but despised the intelligence of one who framed my excuses for my father , just as the squire , by abusing him , would have made me a desperate partisan in a minute . The vitality of the delusion I cherished was therefore partly extinct ; not so the love ; yet the love of him could no longer shake itself free from oppressive shadows . Out of his circle of attraction books were my resource .

Julia had only to lisp , '
100732	100745	100729	100730	my husband	3636	' to startle and agitate me beyond expression . She said simple things '

100846	100852	100853	100853	She	3637	' ; then they shadowed : '
100860	100893	100894	100894	Julia	303	' Such pathetic humility tempted me to exalt her supremely . I talked like a boy , feeling like a man : she behaved like a woman , blushing like a girl . '

Riding out perfectly crazed by it , I met Kiomi , and transferred my emotions . The squire had paid her people an annual sum to keep away from our neighbourhood , while there was a chance of my taking to gipsy life . They had come back to their old camping - ground , rather dissatisfied with the squire . '

101045	101287	101040	101040	you	3640	' She had grown a superb savage , proof against weather and compliments . Her face was like an Egyptian sky fronting night . The strong old Eastern blood put ruddy flame for the red colour ; tawny olive edged from the red ; rare vivid yellow , all but amber . The light that first looks down upon the fallen sun was her complexion above the brows , and round the cheeks , the neck 's nape , the throat , and the firm bosom prompt to lift and sink with her vigour of speech , as her eyes were to flash and darken . Meeting her you swore she was the personification of wandering Asia . There was no question of beauty and grace , for these have laws . The curve of her brows broke like a beaten wave ; the lips and nostrils were wide , tragic in repose . But when she laughed she illuminated you ; where she stepped she made the earth hers . She was as fresh of her East as the morning when her ancient people struck tents in the track of their shadows . I write of her in the style consonant to my ideas of her at the time . I would have carried her off on the impulse and lived her life , merely to have had such a picture moving in my sight , and call it mine . '

101312	101591	101592	101592	I	0	' she answered , grinning scorn . The prizefighter had adopted drinking for his pursuit ; one of her aunts was dead , and she was in quest of money to bury the dead woman with the conventional ceremonies and shows of respect dear to the hearts of gipsies , whose sense of propriety and adherence to customs are a sentiment indulged by them to a degree unknown to the stabled classes . In fact , they have no other which does not come under the definite title of pride ; pride in their physical prowess , their dexterity , ingenuity , and tricksiness , and their purity of blood . Kiomi confessed she had hoped to meet me ; confessed next that she had been waiting to jump out on me : and next that she had sat in a tree watching the Grange yesterday for six hours ; and all for money to do honour to her dead relative , poor little soul ! Heriot and I joined the decent procession to the grave . Her people had some quarrel with the Durstan villagers , and she feared the scandal of being pelted on the way to the church . I knew that nothing of the sort would happen if I was present . Kiomi walked humbly with her head bent , leaving me the thick rippling coarse black locks of her hair for a mark of observation . We were entertained at her camp in the afternoon . I saw no sign of intelligence between her and Heriot . On my asking her , the day before , if she remembered him , she said , '
101596	101603	101604	101604	Heriot	307	'm dangerous for that young man . '

Kiomi undertook to ride to Dipwell , a distance of thirty miles , and carry the message that I would be there by nightfall . Tears were on Janet 's resolute face as we cantered home . After breakfast the squire introduced me to his lawyer , Mr. Burgin , who , closeted alone with me , said formally , '

On the occasion I thought of nothing but the squire 's straight - forwardness , and grieved to have to wound him . Janet helped me . She hinted with a bashfulness , quite new to her , that I must go through some ceremony . Guessing what it was , I saluted her on the cheek . The squire observed that a kiss of that sort might as well have been planted on her back hair . '

Heriot and I rode over to Dipwell . Next night we rode back by moonlight with matter for a year of laughter , singing like two Arabian poets praises of dark and fair , challengeing one to rival the other . Kiomi ! Mabel ! we shouted separately . We had just seen the dregs of the last of the birthday Burgundy . '

I managed to get home with leaden limbs . Next day I was back at Dipwell . Such guilt as I have to answer for I may avow . I made violent love to this silly country beauty , and held every advantage over her other flatterers . She had met me on the evening of the great twenty - first , she and a line of damsels dressed in white and wearing wreaths , and I had claimed the privilege of saluting her . The chief superintendent of the festivities , my father 's old cook , Monsieur Alphonse , turned twilight into noonday with a sheaf of rockets at the moment my lips brushed her cheek . It was a kiss marred ; I claimed to amend it . Besides , we had been bosom friends in childhood . My wonder at the growth of the rose I had left but an insignificant thorny shoot was exquisite natural flattery , sweet reason , to which she could not say nonsense . At each step we trod on souvenirs , innocent in themselves , had they recurred to childish minds . The whisper , '
103762	103964	103758	103759	Martha Thresher	274	' clouded her face with stormy sunset colours . I respected Martha even then for boldly speaking to me on the girl 's behalf . Mrs. Waddy 's courage failed . John Thresher and Mark Sweetwinter were overcome by my father 's princely prodigality ; their heads were turned , they appeared to have assumed that I could do no wrong . To cut short the episode , some one wrote to the squire in uncouth English , telling him I was courting a country lass , and he at once started me for the Continent . We had some conversation on money before parting . The squire allowed me a thousand a year , independent of my own income . He counselled prudence , warned me that I was on my trial , and giving me his word of honour that he should not spy into my Bank accounts , desired me to be worthy of the trust reposed in me . Speculation he forbade . I left him satisfied with the assurance that I meant to make my grand tour neither as a merchant , a gambler , nor a rake , but simply as a plain English gentleman . '
103975	104049	103758	103759	Martha Thresher	274	' said he . Arrived in London , I left my travelling companion , the Rev. Ambrose Peterborough , sipping his Port at the hotel , and rushed down to Dipwell , shot a pebble at Mabel 's window by morning twilight , and soon had her face at the casement . But it was a cloudy and rainbeaten face . She pointed toward the farm , saying that my father was there . '

104110	104231	104104	104104	I	0	' My father in admonishing her had done it tenderly , I was sure . Tenderness was the weapon which had wounded her , and so she shrank from it ; and if I had reproached and abused her she might , perhaps , have obeyed me by coming out , not to return . She was deaf . I kissed my hand to her regretfully ; a condition of spirit gradually dissolved by the haunting phantom of her forehead and mouth crumpling up for fresh floods of tears . Had she concealed that vision with her handkerchief , I might have waited to see her before I saw my father . He soon changed the set of the current . '

You should have heard old John Thresher and Mark Sweetwinter and the others grumbling at the interference of " French frogs ; " with their beef , though Alphonse vowed he only ordered the ox to be turned faster , and he dressed their potatoes in six different ways . I doubt if Dipwell has composed itself yet . You know I sat for president in their tent while the beef went its first round ; and Alphonse was in an awful hurry to drag me into what he called the royal tent .

I was in the state of mind between divination and doubt when the riddle is not impossible to read , would but the heart cease its hurry an instant ; a tumbled sky where the break is coming . It came . The dear old days of my wanderings with Temple framed her face . I knew her without need of pause or retrospect . The crocus raising its cup pointed as when it pierced the earth , and the crocus stretched out on earth , wounded by frost , is the same flower . The face was the same , though the features were changed . Unaltered in expression , but wan , and the kind blue eyes large upon lean brows , her aspect was that of one who had been half caught away and still shook faintly in the relaxing invisible grasp . We stopped at a distance of half - a - dozen paces to allow her time for recollection . She eyed us softly in a fixed manner , while the sea - wind blew her thick redbrown hair to threads on her cheek . Colour on the fair skin told us we were recognized . '

The princess took a pleasure in telling me that this Aennchen of hers knew me well , and had known me before ever her mistress had seen me . Aennchen was the eldest of the two children Temple and I had eaten breakfast with in the forester 's hut . I felt myself as if in the forest again , merely wondering at the growth of the trees , and the narrowness of my vision in those days . At parting , the princess said , '

107750	107954	107744	107744	You	3830	' she said . My father considerately left me to carry on my promenade alone . I crossed the ground she had traversed , noting every feature surrounding it , the curving wheel - track , the thin prickly sand - herbage , the wave - mounds , the sparse wet shells and pebbles , the gleaming flatness of the water , and the vast horizon - boundary of pale flat land level with shore , looking like a dead sister of the sea . By a careful examination of my watch and the sun 's altitude , I was able to calculate what would , in all likelihood , have been his height above yonder waves when her chair was turned toward the city , at a point I reached in the track . But of the matter then simultaneously occupying my mind , to recover which was the second supreme task I proposed to myself - of what . I also was thinking upon the stroke of five o'clock , I could recollect nothing . I could not even recollect whether I happened to be looking on sun and waves when she must have had them full and glorious in her face .
108052	108061	108063	108063	he	925	' I promised you a surprise , Richie , '
108065	108519	108063	108063	he	925	' and you have had it ; whether at all equal to your expectations is for you to determine . I was aware of the margravine 's intention to bring the princess to these sea - sands ; they are famous on the Continent . It was bruited last Winter and Spring that she would be here in the season for bathing ; so I held it likely we should meet . We have , you behold . In point of fact , we owe the good margravine some show of hospitality . The princess has a passion for tossing on the sea . To her a yacht is a thing dropped from the moon . His Highness the prince her father could as soon present her with one as with the moon itself . The illustrious Serenity 's revenue is absorbed , my boy , in the state he has to support . As for his daughter 's dowry , the young gentleman who anticipates getting one with her , I commend to the practise of his whistling . It will be among the sums you may count , if you are a moderate arithmetician , in groschen . The margravine 's income I should reckon to approach twenty thousand per annum , and she proves her honourable sense that she holds it in trust for others by dispersing it rapidly . I fear she loves cards . So , then , I shall go and hire the yacht through Dettermain and Newson , furnish it with piano and swing - cot , etc . ; and if the ladies shrink from a cruise they can have an occasional sail . Here are we at their service . I shall be seriously baffled by fortune if I am not back to you at the end of a week . You will take your early morning walk , I presume . On Sunday see that our chaplain , the excellent Mr. Peterborough , officiates for the assembled Protestants of all nations . It excites our English enthusiasm . In addition , son Richie , it is peculiarly our duty . I , at least , hold the view that it is a family duty . Think it over , Richie boy . Providence , you see , has sent us the man . As for me , I feel as if I were in the dawn of one life with all the mature experience of another . I am calm , I am perfectly unexcited , and I tell you , old son , I believe pick among the highest our destinies are about the most brilliant of any couple in Great Britain . '

He offends me , he trifles , he outrages , he dares permit himself to be indignant . Bon ! we part , and absence pleads for him with the eloquence of Satan . I am his victim .

Only , as Kaunitz , or somebody , said of Joseph II . , or somebody , he thinks or he chews . Englishmen 's mouths were clearly not made for more purposes than one . In truth , I am so utterly wearied , I could pray for the diversion of a descent of rain . The life here is as bad as in Rippau . I might just as well be in Rippau doing duty : the silly people complain , I hear . I am gathering dust . These , my dear , these are the experiences which age women at a prodigious rate .

That 's her instituted governess , duenna , dragon , what you will . She was born for responsibility , I was not ; it makes me miserable . I have had no holiday . True , while she was like one of their wax virgins I had a respite . Fortunately , I hear of you English , that when you fall to sighing , you suck your thumbs and are consoled . '

She is sure to entreat me to accompany her on her annual visit to her territory of Rippau , which she detests ; and , indeed , there is not a vine in the length and breadth of it .

But , Richie , determine not to think little of yourself : there is the main point ; believe me , that is half the battle . You , sir , are one of the wealthiest gentlemen in Europe . You are pronouncedly a gentleman . That is what we can say of you at present , as you appear in the world 's eye . And you are by descent illustrious . Well , no more of that , but consider if you kneel down , who will decline to put a foot on you ? Princes have the habit , and they do it as a matter of course . Challenge them . And they , Richie , are particularly susceptible to pity for the misfortunes of their class kind , I should say , for class it is not ; now I have done . All I tell you is , I intend you , under my guidance , to be happy . '

I have written for them to hire a furnished mansion for a couple of months , carriages , horses , lacqueys . But over here we must really be goodness me ! I know how hard it is ! we must hold the reins on ourselves tight . Baroness Turckems is a most estimable person on the side of her duty . Why , the Dragon of Wantley sat on its eggs , you may be convinced ! She is a praiseworthy dragon . The side she presents to us is horny , and not so agreeable . Talk German when she is on guard . Further I need not counsel a clever old son . Counsel me , Richie . Would it be adviseable to run the prince down to Riversley ? a Prince ! '

What we mean is , your society is not penetrated with learning . But my Professor shall dispute with you . Now you are facile in our German you can defend yourself . He is a deep scholar , broad over tongues and dialects , European , Asiatic - a lion to me , poor little mouse ! I am speaking of Herr Professor von Karsteg , lady aunt . '

116286	116323	116283	116284	the margravine	2880	' Hybrid ! It is my Herr Professor 's word . But English is the choice gathering of languages , and honey is hybrid , unless you condemn the bee to suck at a single flower . '

116459	116505	116456	116457	such persons	4141	' A sentence that hung in the memory of one knowing himself to be animated by the wildest genius of folly . We drove to the statue of Prince Albrecht Wohlgemuth , overlooking leagues of snow - roofed branches . Again Ottilia reverted to Temple , '

116727	116768	116714	116714	he	243	' said the margravine . I glanced hurriedly over both faces . The margravine was snuffing her nostrils up contemptuously . The princess had vividly reddened . Her face was luminous over the nest of white fur folding her neck . '
116786	116799	116800	116800	I	0	' said I , plunging at anything to catch a careless topic , '
116855	116860	116869	116872	My good young man	4158	' The margravine repeated , '
116881	116978	116874	116874	you	4158	' I shuddered . Ottilia divined that her burning blush had involved me . Divination is fiery in the season of blushes , and I , too , fell on the track of her fair spirit , setting out from the transparent betrayal by Schwartz of my night - watch in the pine - wood near the Traun river - falls . My feelings were as if a wave had rolled me helpless to land , at the margravine 's mercy should she put another question . She startled us with a loud outburst of laughter . '
117010	117412	117005	117008	a figure of bronze	4161	' she exclaimed . Ottilia and I exchanged a grave look . The gentleness of the old time was sweet to us both : but we had the wish that my father 's extravagant prominency in it might be forgotten . At the dinner - table I made the acquaintance of the Herr Professor Dr. Julius von Karsteg , tutor to the princess , a grey , broad - headed man , whose chin remained imbedded in his neck - cloth when his eyelids were raised on a speaker . The first impression of him was , that he was chiefly neck - cloth , coat - collar , grand head , and gruffness . He had not joined the ceremonial step from the reception to the dining saloon , but had shuffled in from a side - door . No one paid him any deference save the princess . The margravine had the habit of thrumming the table thrice as soon as she heard his voice : nor was I displeased by such an exhibition of impatience , considering that he spoke merely for the purpose of snubbing me . His powers were placed in evidence by her not daring to utter a sarcasm , which was possibly the main cause of her burning fretfulness . I believe there was not a word uttered by me throughout the dinner that escaped him . Nevertheless , he did his business of catching and worrying my poor unwary sentences too neatly for me , an admirer of real force and aptitude , to feel vindictive . I behaved to him like a gentleman , as we phrase it , and obtained once an encouraging nod from the margravine . She leaned to me to say , that they were accustomed to think themselves lucky if no learned talk came on between the Professor and his pupil . The truth was , that his residence in Sarkeld was an honour to the prince , and his acceptance of the tutorship a signal condescension , accounted for by his appreciation of the princess 's intelligence . He was a man distinguished even in Germany for scholarship , rather notorious for his political and social opinions too . The margravine , with infinite humour in her countenance , informed me that he wished to fit the princess for the dignity of a Doctor of Laws . '
117498	117540	117541	117541	You	4170	' The Professor allowed himself extraordinary liberties with strangers , the guests of the margravine . I met him crossing an inner court next day . He interrupted me in the middle of a commonplace remark , and to this effect : '
117554	117592	117541	117541	You	4170	' So profoundly penetrated with thoughtfulness was the tone of his voice that I could not take umbrage . The attempt to analyze his signification cost me an aching forehead , perhaps because I knew it too acutely .
117636	117642	117644	117644	Ottilia	432	' You like my Professor ? '
117646	117657	117644	117644	Ottilia	432	' I do : I respect him for his learning . '
117658	117786	117597	117597	She	432	' You forgive him his irony ? It is not meant to be personal to you . England is the object ; and partly , I may tell you , it springs from jealousy . You have such wealth ! You embrace half the world : you are such a little island ! All this is wonderful . The bitterness is , you are such a mindless people I do but quote to explain my Professor 's ideas . " Mindless , " he says , " and arrogant , and neither in the material nor in the spiritual kingdom of noble or gracious stature , and ceasing to have a brave aspect . " He calls you squat Goths . Can you bear to hear me ? '
117787	117790	117597	117597	She	432	' Princess ! '
117791	117853	117644	117644	Ottilia	432	' And to his conception , you , who were pioneers when the earth had to be shaped for implements and dug for gold , will turn upon us and stop our march ; you are to be overthrown and left behind , there to gain humility from the only teacher you can understand from poverty . Will you defend yourself ? '
117854	117875	117597	117597	She	432	' Well , no , frankly , I will not . The proper defence for a nation is its history . '
117876	117881	117597	117597	She	432	' For an individual ? '
117882	117895	117597	117597	She	432	' For a man , his readiness to abide by his word . '
117896	117902	117644	117644	Ottilia	432	' For a woman what ? '
117903	117911	117597	117597	She	432	' For a princess , her ancestry . '
117912	118140	117597	117597	She	432	' Ah ! but I spoke of women . There , there is my ground of love for my Professor ! I meet my equals , princes , princesses , and the man , the woman , is out of them , gone , flown ! They are out of the tide of humanity ; they are walking titles , " Now , " says my Professor , " that tide is the blood of our being ; the blood is the life - giver ; and to be cut off from it is to perish . " Our princely houses he esteems as dead wood . Not near so much say I : yet I hear my equals talk , and I think , " Oh ! my Professor , they testify to your wisdom . " I love him because he has given my every sense a face - forward attitude you will complain of my feebleness of speech to exterior existence . There is a princely view of life which is a true one ; but it is a false one if it is the sole one . In your Parliament your House of Commons shows us real princes , your Throne merely titled ones . I speak what everybody knows , and you , I am sure , are astonished to hear me . '
118141	118145	118147	118147	I.	4175	' I am , '
118148	118256	117597	117597	She	432	' It is owing to my Professor , my mind 's father and mother . They say it is the pleasure of low - born people to feel themselves princes ; mine it is to share their natural feelings . " For a princess , her ancestry . " Yes ; but for a princess who is no more than princess , her ancestors are a bundle of faggots , and she , with her mind and heart tied fast to them , is , at least a good half of her , dead wood . This is our opinion . May I guess at your thoughts ? '
118257	118271	117597	117597	She	432	' It 's more than I could dare to do myself , princess . '
118291	118301	118302	118302	she	432	' Out of the number , then , this , '
118305	118324	118302	118302	she	432	' you think that your English young ladies have command over their tongues : is it not so ? '
118325	118332	117597	117597	She	432	' There are prattlers among them . '
118333	118339	117597	117597	She	432	' Are they educated strictly ? '
118340	118359	118302	118302	she	432	' I know little of them . They seem to me to be educated to conceal their education . '
118360	118365	117597	117597	She	432	' They reject ideas ? '
118366	118377	118378	118378	Ottilia	432	' It is uncertain whether they have had the offer . '
118381	118391	118378	118378	Ottilia	432	' Would it be a home in their midst ? '
118405	118413	118414	118414	she	432	' I questioned you of English ladies , '
118417	118500	118414	118414	she	432	' because we read your writings of us . Your kindness to us is that which passes from nurse to infant ; your criticism reminds one of paedagogue and urchin . You make us sorry for our manners and habits , if they are so bad ; but most of all you are merry at our simplicity . Not only we say what we feel , we display it . Now , I am so German , this offence is especially mine . '

118519	118534	118414	118414	she	432	' Yet you understand me . You know me well . How is that ? '

118554	118571	118551	118551	She	4176	' I bring you to be German , you see . Could you forsake your England ? '

118585	118598	118551	118551	She	4176	' Cheerfully , if I had my work and my my friend . '
118599	118621	118637	118637	her	4176	' No ; but well I know a man 's field of labour is his country . You have your ambition . '
118622	118629	118630	118630	She	4176	' Yes , now I have . '
118648	118654	118630	118630	She	4176	' Would that extinguish it ? '
118655	118666	118637	118637	her	4176	' In the form of an avalanche perhaps it would . '
118667	118679	118637	118637	her	4176	' Then you make your aims a part of your life ? '
118680	118684	118630	118630	She	4176	' I do . '
118685	119019	118637	118637	her	4176	' Then you win ! or it is written of you that you never knew failure ! So with me . I set my life upon my aim when I feel that the object is of true worth . I win , or death hides from me my missing it . This I look to ; this obtains my Professor 's nod , and the approval of my conscience . Worthiness , however ! the mind must be trained to discern it . We can err very easily in youth ; and to find ourselves shooting at a false mark uncontrollably must be a cruel thing . I can not say it is undeserving the scourge of derision . Do you know yourself ? I do not ; and I am told by my Professor that it is the sole subject to which you should not give a close attention . I can believe him . For who beguiles so much as Self ? Tell her to play , she plays her sweetest . Lurk to surprise her , and what a serpent she becomes ! She is not to be aware that you are watching her . You have to review her acts , observe her methods . Always be above her ; then by - and - by you catch her hesitating at cross - roads ; then she is bare : you catch her bewailing or exulting ; then she can no longer pretend she is other than she seems . I make self the feminine , for she is the weaker , and the soul has to purify and raise her . On that point my Professor and I disagree . Dr. Julius , unlike our modern Germans , esteems women over men , or it is a further stroke of his irony . He does not think your English ladies have heads : of us he is proud as a laurelled poet . Have I talked you dumb ? '
119020	119032	119033	119033	She	4177	' Princess , you have given me matter to think upon . '

Let my Professor hear your immense admiration for his pupil 's accomplishments . Hear him then in return ! He will beat at me like the rainy West wind on a lily . " See , " he will say , when I am broken and bespattered , '
119275	119302	119270	119270	you	4181	' Her hand was hanging loose . I grasped it . She drew a sudden long breath , and murmured , without fretting to disengage herself , '
119309	119326	119270	119270	you	4181	' Her voice carried an unmistakeable command . I kissed above the fingers and released them . '
119334	119405	119270	119270	you	4181	' said she , leading with an easy canter , face averted . She put on fresh speed ; I was outstripped . Had she quitted me in anger ? Had she parted from me out of view of the villa windows to make it possible for us to meet accidentally again in the shadow of her old protecting Warhead , as we named him from his appearance , gaunt Schwartz ?

119810	119859	119860	119860	I	0	' Collect your wits . We will call it Shakespeare 's book ; or Gothe 's , in the minor issues . No , not minor , but a narrower volume . You were about to give me the answer of a hypocrite . Was it not so ? '
119878	119898	119874	119874	He	10624	' Good . Then I apprehend that you wait for the shifting of a tide to carry you on ? '
119899	119907	119874	119874	He	10624	' I try to strengthen my mind . '

119918	119931	119915	119915	he	10624	' Well , as far as your schools of teaching will allow . '
119932	119994	119874	119874	He	10624	' That is , you read and commit to memory , like other young scholars . Whereunto ? Have you no aim ? You have , or I am told you are to have , fabulous wealth a dragon 's heap . You are one of the main drainpipes of English gold . What is your object ? To spend it ? '
119995	120005	119874	119874	He	10624	' I shall hope to do good with it . '
120006	120052	119915	119915	he	10624	' To do good ! There is hardly a prince or millionaire , in history or alive , who has not in his young days hugged that notion . Pleasure swarms , he has the pick of his market . You English live for pleasure . '
120053	120063	119874	119874	He	10624	' We are the hardest workers in the world . '
120064	120075	120076	120076	He	4190	' That you may live for pleasure ! Deny it ! '
120087	120328	120078	120078	his	4190	' Yes , you work hard for money . You eat and drink , and boast of your exercises : they sharpen your appetites . So goes the round . We strive , we fail ; you are our frog - chorus of critics , and you suppose that your brekek - koax affects us . I say we strive and fail , but we strive on , while you remain in a past age , and are proud of it . You reproach us with lack of common sense , as if the belly were its seat . Now I ask you whether you have a scheme of life , that I may know whether you are to be another of those huge human pumpkins called rich men , who cover your country and drain its blood and intellect those impoverishers of nature ! Here we have our princes ; but they are rulers , they are responsible , they have their tasks , and if they also run to gourds , the scandal punishes them and their order , all in seasonable time . They stand eminent . Do you mark me ? They are not a community , and are not bad enough ! bad enough ! but they are not protected by laws in their right to do nothing for what they receive . That system is an invention of the commercial genius and the English . '
120329	120338	120076	120076	He	4190	' We have our aristocracy , Herr Professor . '
120339	120463	120076	120076	He	4190	' Your nobles are nothing but rich men inflated with empty traditions of insufferable , because unwarrantable , pride , and drawing , substance from alliances with the merchant class . Are they your leaders ? Do they lead you in Letters ? in the Arts ? ay , or in Government ? No , not , I am informed , not even in military service ! and there our titled witlings do manage to hold up their brainless pates . You are all in one mass , struggling in the stream to get out and lie and wallow and belch on the banks . You work so hard that you have all but one aim , and that is fatness and ease ! '
120464	120471	120472	120472	I	0	' Pardon me , Herr Professor , '
120475	120522	120472	120472	I	0	' I see your drift . Still I think we are the only people on earth who have shown mankind a representation of freedom . And as to our aristocracy , I must , with due deference to you , maintain that it is widely respected . '
120544	120547	120548	120548	he	4191	' Widely ! '
120551	120569	120548	120548	he	4191	' It is widely respected ; and you respect it : and why do you respect it ? '

120580	120600	120472	120472	I	0	' We beat you in illustrious names and in the age of the lines , my good young man . '

120619	120631	120472	120472	I	0	' So long as it imperilled their own ! Any longer ? '
120632	120650	120472	120472	I	0	' Well , they have known how to yield . They have helped to build our Constitution . '
120651	120725	120726	120726	He	4192	' Reverence their ancestors , then ! The worse for such descendants . But you have touched the exact stamp of the English mind : it is , to accept whatsoever is bequeathed it , without inquiry whether there is any change in the matter . Nobles in very fact you would not let them be if they could . Nobles in name , with a remote recommendation to posterity that suits you ! '
120742	120807	120739	120739	he	4192	' Yes , yes : you worship your aristocracy . It is notorious . You have a sort of sagacity . I am not prepared to contest the statement that you have a political instinct . Here it is chiefly social . You worship your so - called aristocracy perforce in order to preserve an ideal of contrast to the vulgarity of the nation . '
120823	120849	120850	120850	He	4192	' The weapons I would use in reply to such remarks I can not address to you , Herr Professor . Therefore , excuse me . '
120862	120922	120850	120850	He	4192	' Nay , my good young Englishman , but on the other hand you have not answered me . And hear me : yes , you have shown us a representation of freedom . True . But you are content with it in a world that moves by computation some considerable sum upwards of sixty thousand miles an hour . '
120923	120933	120935	120935	I.	0	' Not on a fresh journey a recurring course ! '
120936	120939	120940	120940	he	4192	' Good ! '

120972	121215	120957	120958	the Professor	10624	' The mind journeys somewhat in that way , and we in our old Germany hold that the mind advances notwithstanding . Astronomers condescending to earthly philosophy may admit that advance in the physical universe is computable , though not perceptible . Some whither we tend , shell and spirit . You English , fighting your little battles of domestic policy , and sneering at us for flying at higher game , you unimpressionable English , who wo n't believe in the existence of aims that do n't drop on the ground before your eyes , and squat and stare at you , you assert that man 's labour is completed when the poor are kept from crying out . Now my question is , have you a scheme of life consonant with the spirit of modern philosophy with the views of intelligent , moral , humane human beings of this period ? Or are you one of your robust English brotherhood worthy of a Caligula in his prime , lions in gymnastics for a time ; sheep always in the dominions of mind ; and all of one pattern , all in a rut ! Favour me with an outline of your ideas . Pour them out pell - mell , intelligibly or not , no matter . I undertake to catch you somewhere . I mean to know you , hark you , rather with your assistance than without it . '
121275	121278	121279	121279	I	0	' Indeed , '
121282	121347	121279	121279	I	0	' I have few thoughts to communicate at present , Herr Professor . My German will fail me as soon as I quit common ground . I love my country , and I do not reckon it as perfect . We are swillers , possibly gluttons ; we have a large prosperous middle class ; many good men are to be found in it . '
121364	121387	121355	121355	My	0	' Yes , Herr Professor , on my way when a boy to this very place I met a thorough good man . '

121470	121477	121468	121468	he	520	' Suppose we boast of it . '

121487	121495	121483	121483	he	520	' Why , surely it 's something ! '
121496	121525	121468	121468	he	520	' Something for non - commissioned officers to boast of ; not for statesmen . However , say that you are fit to govern Asiatics . Go on . '
121526	121542	121468	121468	he	520	' I would endeavour to equalize ranks at home , encourage the growth of ideas ... '
121543	121623	121483	121483	he	520	' Supporting a non - celibate clergy , and an intermingled aristocracy ? Your endeavours , my good young man , will lessen like those of the man who employed a spade to uproot a rock . It wants blasting . Your married clergy and merchandized aristocracy are coils : they are the ivy about your social tree : you would resemble Laocoon in the throes , if one could imagine you anything of a heroic figure . Forward . '
121629	121668	121626	121626	I	0	' It 's useless ! I have not thought at all . I have been barely educated . I only know that I do desire with all my heart to know more , to be of some service . '

121765	121839	121757	121757	He	4199	' The case , I suspect , is singular , and does not often happen to a youth . You are fortunate if you have a solid and adventurous mind : most unfortunate if you are a mere sensational whipster . There 's an explanation that covers the whole .

I have thoughts and aims , feeble at present Good God ! I see nothing for me but a choice of the two " most unfortunate " seems likeliest . You read at a glance that I had no other choice . Rather the extremes ! I would rather grasp the limits of life and be swung to the pits below , be the most unfortunate of human beings , than never to have aimed at a star . You laugh at me ?

124951	124988	124893	124893	my	0	' Immensely . You know we have a passion for English thoroughbreds . Pardon me , you look as if you had been close on a sunstroke . Do you generally take rides in this weather ? '
124989	125047	124917	124917	he	510	' I was out by chance . If you like him , pray take him ; take him . Mount him and try him . He is yours if you care to have him ; if he does n't suit you send him up to Count Fretzel 's . I 've had riding enough in the light . '
125048	125053	125055	125055	he	4291	' Perhaps you have , '
125060	125157	125055	125055	he	4291	' It 's difficult to resist the offer of such a horse . If you want to dispose of him , mention it when we meet again . Shall I try him ? I have a slight inclination to go as hard as you have been going , but he shall have good grooming in the prince 's stables , and that 's less than half as near again as Count Pretzel 's place ; and a horse like this ought not to be out in this weather , if you will permit me the remark .

125276	125460	125461	125461	Otto	510	' With visible pleasure he swung to the saddle . I saw him fix his cavalry thighs and bound off as if he meant to take a gate . Had he glanced behind him he would have fancied that the sun had done its worst . I ran at full speed down the footpath , mad to think she might have returned homeward by the lake . The two had parted why ? He this way , she that . They would not have parted but for a division of the will . I came on the empty boat . Schwartz lay near it beneath heavy boughs , smoking and perspiring in peace . Neither of us spoke . And it was now tempered by a fit of alarm that I renewed my search . So when I beheld her , intense gratitude broke my passion ; when I touched her hand it was trembling for absolute assurance of her safety . She was leaning against a tree , gazing on the ground , a white figure in that iron - moted gloom . '
125463	125523	125524	125524	You	510	' she cried , shrinking from the touch ; but at sight of me , all softly as a light in the heavens , her face melted in a suffusion of wavering smiles , and deep colour shot over them , heavenly to see . She pressed her bosom while I spoke : a lover 's speech , breathless . '
125528	125532	125524	125524	You	510	' she said . '

I feared from the helpless hanging of her underlip that she would swoon ; a shudder convulsed her ; and at the same time I became aware of the blotting out of sunlight , and a strange bowing and shore - like noising of the forest .

They were , perhaps , the excuse for my conduct , if I had any . Schwartz burst on us with his drill - sergeant 's shout for the princess . Standing grey in big rain - drops he was an object of curiosity to us both . He came to take her orders . '

125991	126121	125928	125928	you	0	' Schwartz and I ran to the boat , hauled it on land , and set it keel upward against a low leafy dripping branch . To this place of shelter , protecting her as securely as I could , I led the princess , while Schwartz happed a rough trench around it with one of the sculls . We started him on foot to do the best thing possible ; for the storm gave no promise that it was a passing one . In truth , I knew that I should have been the emissary and he the guard ; but the storm overhead was not fuller of its mighty burden than I of mine . I looked on her as mine for the hour , and well won .

126957	127010	126946	126955	a critic who would have good reason to be merciful	4328	' The night has come that writes the chapter of the day . My father has had his interview with his head - forester to learn what has befallen from the storm in the forest . All has not been told him ! That shall not be delayed beyond to - morrow . '
127211	127237	127200	127200	I	0	' Pardon it to one who knew that she would require super - feminine power of decision to resolve that she would dispose of herself ! '
127464	127504	127455	127455	I	0	' To - morrow I tell the prince , my father , that I am a plighted woman . Then for us the struggle , for him the grief . I have to look on him and deal it . '
127521	127650	127510	127511	Dr. Julius	520	' " My Professor " was won by it . He once did incline to be the young bold Englishman 's enemy . " Why is he here ? what seeks he among us ? " It was his jealousy , not of the man , but of the nation , which would send one to break and bear away his carefully cultivated German lily . No eye but his did read me through . And you endured the trial that was forced on you . You made no claim for recompense when it was over . No , there is no pure love but strong love ! It belongs to our original elements , and of its purity should never be question , only of its strength . '
127732	128053	128054	128057	OTTILIA FREDERIKA WILHELMINA HEDWIG	4356	' So it was considered that in refusing my cousin Otto and other proposed alliances , I was heart - free . An instructed princess , they thought , was of the woeful species of woman . You left us : I lost you . I heard you praised for civil indifference to me the one great quality you do not possess ! Then it was the fancy of people that I , being very cold , might be suffered to hear my cousin plead for himself . The majority of our family favour Otto . He was permitted to woo me as though I had been a simple maid ; and henceforth shall I have pity for all poor little feminine things who are so persecuted , asked to inflict cruelty to take a sword and strike with it . But I who look on marriage as more than a surrender I could well withstand surpassing eloquence . It was easy to me to be inflexible in speech and will when I stood there , entreated to change myself . But when came magically the other , who is my heart , my voice , my mate , the half of me , and broke into illumination of things long hidden oh ! then did I say to you that it was my weakness had come upon me ? It was my last outcry of self the " I " expiring . I am now yours , " We " has long overshadowed " I , " and now engulphs it . We are one . If it were new to me to find myself interrogating the mind of my beloved , relying on his courage , taking many proofs of his devotion , I might pause to re - peruse my words here , without scruple , written . I sign it , before heaven , your Ottilia . '

128238	128258	128593	128593	he	4365	' You have not , I presume , to be informed of the business in hand , Mr. Richmond ! '
128259	128270	128204	128204	She	2880	' Your Highness , I believe I can guess it . '
128278	128295	128296	128296	he	925	' An impossibility ! a monstrous extravagance ! a thing unheard of ! mania ! mania ! '
128299	128582	128296	128296	he	925	' You are aware , sir , that you have been doing your worst to destroy the settled arrangements of my family ? What does it mean ? In common reason you can not indulge any legitimate hope of succeeding . Taking you as a foreigner , you must know that . Judge of the case by your own reigning Families . Such events never happen amongst them . Do you suppose that the possession of immense wealth entitles you to the immeasurable presumption of aspiring to equality of position with reigning Houses ? Such folly is more frequently castigated than reasoned with . Why , now now , were it published that I had condescended condescend as I am doing , I should be the laughing - stock of every Court in Europe . You English want many lessons . You are taught by your scribes to despise the dignity which is not supported by a multitude of bayonets , guns , and gold . I heard of it when I travelled incognito . You make merry over little potentates . Good . But do not cross their paths . Their dominion may be circumscribed , but they have it ; and where we are now , my power equals that of the Kaiser and the Czar . You will do me the favour to understand that I am not boasting , not menacing ; I attempt , since it is extraordinarily imposed on me , to instruct you . I have cause to be offended ; I waive it . I meet you on common ground , and address myself to your good sense . Have you anything to say ? '
128583	128588	128666	128666	he	4365	' Much , sir . '
128589	128592	128593	128593	he	4365	' Much ? '
128619	128641	128612	128612	he	4365	' I have much to say , your Highness . First , to ask pardon of you , without excusing myself . '
128642	128659	128661	128661	I	0	' A condition , apparently , that absolves the necessity for the grant . Speak precisely . '
128682	128721	128661	128661	I	0	' I have offended your Highness . You have done me the honour to suggest that it is owing to my English training . You will credit my assurance that the offence was not intentional , not preconceived . '
128722	128737	128612	128612	he	4365	' You charge it upon your having been trained among a nation of shopkeepers ? '
128738	128750	128612	128612	he	4365	' My countrymen are not illiterate or unmannerly , your Highness . '
128751	128768	128661	128661	I	0	' I have not spoken it ; I may add , I do not think it . '
128769	128797	128612	128612	he	4365	' I feared that your Highness entertained what I find to be a very general , perhaps here and there wilful , error with regard to England . '
128798	128837	128612	128612	he	4365	' When I was in the service I had a comrade , a gallant gentleman , deeply beloved by me , and he was an Englishman . He died in the uniform and under the flag I reverence . '
128838	128909	128661	128661	I	0	' I rejoice that your Highness has had this experience of us . I have to imagine that I expressed myself badly . My English training certainly does not preclude the respect due to exalted rank . Your Highness will , I trust humbly , pardon my offence . I do not excuse myself because I can not withdraw , and I am incapable of saying that I regret it . '
128910	128918	128920	128921	the prince	2912	' In cool blood you utter that ? '
128928	129110	129111	129111	he	4368	' What are the impossible , monstrous ideas you where ? Who leads you to fancy there is one earthly chance for you when you say you can not withdraw ? Can not ? Are you requested ? Are you consulted ? It is a question to be decided in the imperative : you must . What wheel it is you think you have sufficient vigour to stop , I am profoundly unaware , but I am prepared to affirm that it is not the wheel of my household . I would declare it , were I a plain citizen . You are a nullity in the case , in point of your individual will a nullity swept away with one wave of the hand . You can do this , and nothing else : you can apologize , recognize your station , repair a degree of mischief that I will not say was preconceived or plotted . So for awhile pursue your studies , your travels . In time it will give me pleasure to receive you . Mr. Richmond , '
129118	129133	129111	129111	he	4368	' even the head of a little German principality has to give numberless audiences . '
129486	129489	129491	129491	he	925	' None , '
129494	129518	129519	129519	He	925	' none . I have everything to hear , nothing to relate ; and , happily , I can hardly speak for joy . '
129573	129584	129585	129585	he	925	' But she is yours ! she is yours already ! '
129589	129693	129585	129585	he	925	' She is the reigning intellect there . I dreaded her very intellect would give us all the trouble , and behold , it is our ally ! The prince lives with an elbow out of his income . But for me it would be other parts of his person as well , I assure you , and the world would see such a princely tatterdemalion as would astonish it . Money to him is important . He must carry on his mine . He can carry on nothing without my help . By the way , we have to deal out cheques ? '
129829	129840	129841	129842	my father	925	' They are a part of our enginery , Richie , '
130886	130900	130878	130879	The prince	2912	' He meant to teach me that this was not a laughing matter . '

131947	131960	131962	131962	he	925	' Your name the signature of your name alone , darling Richie , '
132042	132101	132036	132036	Richie	448	' He was distracting . His natural tenderness and neatness of hand qualified him for spreading peace in a sick - room ; but he was too full of life and his scheme , and knowing me out of danger , he could not forbear giving his despondency an outlet . I heard him exclaim in big sighs : '
132107	132111	132112	132112	She	4302	' and again , '
132118	132173	132112	132112	She	4302	' Never was man so incorrigibly dramatic . He would walk up to a bookcase and take down a volume , when the interjectional fit waxed violent , flip the pages , affecting a perplexity he would assuredly have been struck by had he perused them , and read , as he did once , '
132242	132327	132330	132330	Richie	448	' and he shut up the book with a report , and bounded to my side to beg pardon of me . From his particular abuse of the margravine , the iteration of certain phrases , which he uttered to denounce and defy them , I gathered that an interview had passed between the two , and that she had notified a blockade against all letters addressed to the princess . He half admitted having rushed to the palace on his road to me . '
132332	132345	132395	132398	the coarse old woman	4496	' said he , pressing me again to write the moving line , '
132359	132365	132366	132367	The margravine	2880	' He looked mournfully astute . '
132532	132573	133211	133214	good - hearted people	4504	' His imitation of the margravine was the pleasantest thing I heard from him . The princess 's maid and confidante , he regretted to state , was incorruptible , which I knew . That line of Ottilia 's writing , '
132578	133201	133211	133214	good - hearted people	4504	' read by me in view of the root - mountain of the Royal House of Princes , scoffed at me insufferably whenever my father showed me these openings of his mind , until I was dragged down to think almost that I had not loved the woman and noble soul , but only the glorified princess the carved gilt frame instead of the divine portrait ! a shameful acrid suspicion , ransacking my conscience with the thrusting in of a foul torch here and there . For why had I shunned him of late ? How was it that he tortured me now ? Did I in no degree participate in the poignant savour of his scheme ? Such questionings set me flushing in deadly chills . My brain was weak , my heart exhausted , my body seemed truthful perforce and confessed on the rack . I could not deny that I had partly , insensibly clung to the vain glitter of hereditary distinction , my father 's pitfall ; taking it for a substantial foothold , when a young man of wit and sensibility and , mark you , true pride , would have made it his first care to trample that under heel . Excellent is pride ; but oh ! be sure of its foundations before you go on building monument high . I know nothing to equal the anguish of an examination of the basis of one 's pride that discovers it not solidly fixed ; an imposing , self - imposing structure , piled upon empty cellarage . It will inevitably , like a tree striking bad soil , betray itself at the top with time . And the anguish I speak of will be the sole healthy sign about you . Whether in the middle of life it is adviseable to descend the pedestal altogether , I dare not say . Few take the precaution to build a flight of steps inside it is not a labour to be proud of ; fewer like to let themselves down in the public eye it amounts to a castigation ; you must , I fear , remain up there , and accept your chance in toppling over . But in any case , delude yourself as you please , your lofty baldness will assuredly be seen with time . Meanwhile , you can not escape the internal intimations of your unsoundness . A man 's pride is the front and headpiece of his character , his soul 's support or snare . Look to it in youth . I have to thank the interminable hours on my wretched sick - bed for a singularly beneficial investigation of the ledger of my deeds and omissions and moral stock . Perhaps it has already struck you that one who takes the trouble to sit and write his history for as large a world as he can obtain , and shape his style to harmonize with every development of his nature , can no longer have much of the hard grain of pride in him . A proud puppet - showman blowing into Pandaean pipes is an inconceivable object , except to those who judge of characteristics from posture . It began to be observed by others that my father was not the most comforting of nurses to me . My landlady brought a young girl up to my room , and introduced her under the name of Lieschen , saying that she had for a long time been interested in me , and had been diligent in calling to inquire for news of my condition . Commanded to speak for herself , this Lieschen coloured and said demurely , '
133248	133269	133243	133243	you	7975	' My father took her shoulder between finger and thumb , and slightly shook her to each ejaculation of his emphatic '
133298	133474	133243	133243	you	7975	' She looked at me softly , and I said I wished her to come . My father appealed to the sagacity of the matron . So jealous was he of a suggested partner in his task that he had refused my earnest requests to have Mr. Peterborough to share the hours of watching by my side . The visits of college friends and acquaintances were cut very short , he soon reduced them to talk in a hush with thumbs and nods and eyebrows ; and if it had not been so annoying to me , I could have laughed at his method of accustoming the regular visitors to make ready , immediately after greeting , for his affectionate dismissal of them . Lieschen went away with the mute blessing of his finger on one of her modest dimples ; but , to his amazement , she returned in the evening . He gave her a lecture , to which she listened attentively , and came again in the morning . He was petrified . '
133487	133608	133243	133243	you	7975	' said he , to indicate a list of the untameables , without distressing the one present , and , acknowledging himself beaten , he ruefully accepted his holiday . The girl was like sweet Spring in my room . She spoke of Sarkeld familiarly . She was born in that neighbourhood , she informed me , and had been educated by a dear great lady . Her smile of pleasure on entering the room one morning , and seeing me dressed and sitting in a grand - fatherly chair by the breezy window , was like a salutation of returning health . My father made another stand against the usurper of his privileges ; he refused to go out . '
133614	133618	133611	133611	I	0	' said Lieschen , '
133626	133627	133611	133611	I	0	' '
133635	133667	133757	133757	you	0	' I begged of her , and stretched out my hands for hers , while she gazed sadly from the doorway . He suspected some foolishness or he was actually jealous . '
133672	133696	133757	133757	you	0	' He went forthwith a murmured groan . She deceived me by taking her seat in perfect repose . After smoothing her apron , '
133702	133706	133698	133698	I	0	' she said . '

133738	133743	133698	133698	I	0	' the girl exclaimed . '
133792	134291	133788	133790	dear Mr. Patient	4511	' She drew from her bosom , attached to a piece of blue ribbon , the half of an English shilling , kissed it , and blew a soft farewell to me : She had not been long gone when the Princess Ottilia stood in her place . A shilling tossed by an English boy to a couple of little foreign girls in a woodman 's hut ! you would not expect it to withstand the common fate of silver coins , and preserve mysterious virtues by living celibate , neither multiplying nor reduced , ultimately to play the part of a powerful magician in bringing the boy grown man to the feet of an illustrious lady , and her to his side in sickness , treasonably to the laws of her station . The little women quarrelled over it , and snatched and hid and contemplated it in secret , each in her turn , until the strife it engendered was put an end to by a doughty smith , their mother 's brother , who divided it into equal halves , through which he drove a hole , and the pieces being now thrown out of the currency , each one wore her share of it in her bosom from that time , proudly appeased . They were not ordinary peasant children , and happily for them they had another friend that was not a bird of passage , and was endowed by nature and position to do the work of an angel . She had them educated to read , write , and knit , and learn pretty manners , and in good season she took one of the sisters to wait on her own person . The second went , upon her recommendation , into the household of a Professor of a neighbouring University . But neither of them abjured her superstitious belief in the proved merits of the talisman she wore . So when they saw the careless giver again they remembered him ; their gratitude was as fresh as on that romantic morning of their childhood , and they resolved without concert to serve him after their own fashion , and quickly spied a way to it . They were German girls . You are now enabled to guess more than was known to Ottilia and me of the curious agency at work to shuffle us together . The doors of her suite in the palace were barred against letters addressed to the princess ; the delivery of letters to her was interdicted , she consenting , yet she found one : it lay on the broad walk of the orange - trees , between the pleasure and the fruit - gardens , as if dropped by a falcon in mid air . Ottilia beheld it , and started . Her little maid walking close by , exclaimed , scuttling round in front of her the while like an urchin in sabots , '
134307	134313	134305	134305	me	0	' The guileless mistress replied , '
134317	134323	134305	134305	me	0	' Whereupon the maid said : '
134363	134375	134376	134376	He	4514	' The letter was seized and opened , and Ottilia read : '
134452	134542	134438	134438	he	4514	' She supped at her father 's table , and amused the margravine and him alternately with cards and a sonata . Before twelve at midnight she was driving on the road to the University , saying farewell to what her mind reverenced , so that her lover might but have sight of her . She imagined I had been assassinated . For a long time , and most pertinaciously , this idea dwelt with her . I could not dispossess her of it , even after uttering the word '
134544	134563	134438	134438	he	4514	' I know not how often . I had flatly to relate the whole - of the circumstances . '
134570	134871	134565	134565	Otto	510	' she cried out . What was that she reverenced ? It was what she jeopardized her state , her rank , her dignity as princess and daughter of an ancient House , things typical to her of sovereign duties , and the high seclusion of her name . To her the escapades of foolish damsels were abominable . The laws of society as well as of her exalted station were in harmony with her intelligence . She thought them good , but obeyed them as a subject , not slavishly : she claimed the right to exercise her trained reason . The modestest , humblest , sweetest of women , undervaluing nothing that she possessed , least of all what was due from her to others , she could go whithersoever her reason directed her , putting anything aside to act justly according to her light . Nor would she have had cause to repent had I been the man she held me to be . Even with me she had not behaved precipitately . My course of probation was severe and long before she allowed her heart to speak . Pale from a sleepless night and her heart 's weariful eagerness to be near me , she sat by my chair , holding my hand , and sometimes looking into my eyes to find the life reflecting hers as in a sunken well that has once been a spring . My books and poor bachelor comforts caught her attention between - whiles . We talked of the day of storm by the lake ; we read the unsigned letter . With her hand in mine I slept some minutes , and awoke grasping it , doubting and terrified , so great a wave of life lifted me up . '
134879	134883	134874	134874	you	4521	' I sighed . '
134887	134905	134874	134874	you	4521	' said she . The nature of the step she had taken began to dawn on me . '

135280	135322	135323	135323	She	4537	' Her little Ann coming in with chocolate and strips of fine white bread to dip in it stopped my efforts to explain the distinction between an assassination and a duel . I noticed then the likeness of Aennchen to Lieschen . '

135346	135420	135338	135338	Lieschen	545	' Aennchen , with a blush , murmured , that she heard and would obey . I had a memorable pleasure in watching my beloved eat and drink under my roof . The duel remained incomprehensible to her . She first frightened me by remarking that duels were the pastime of brainless young men . Her next remark , in answer to my repeated attempts to shield my antagonist from a capital charge : '
135430	135501	135502	135502	Otto	510	' accompanied by a slightly investigating glance of timid surprise , gave me pain , together with a flashing apprehension of what she had forfeited , whom offended , to rush to the succour of a duellist . I had to repeat to her who my enemy was , so that there should be no further mention of assassination . Prince Otto 's name seemed to entangle her understanding completely . '
135506	135510	135511	135511	he	510	' she murmured ; '
135609	135618	135656	135656	you	4545	' She knew the nature of a duel . '
135627	135643	135656	135656	you	4545	' she broke through my stammered explanations with unwonted impatience , and pressing my hand : '

135780	135818	135768	135768	he	510	' I felt bound to plead on his behalf , thinking , in spite of a veritable anguish of gathering dread , that she had become enlightened and would soon take the common view of our case ; '

138086	138130	138131	138131	You	4605	' Lieschen thought she supposed . But why ? Why did she think and suppose ? What made her anticipate the princess 's arrival ? This inveterate why communicated its terrors to Aennchen , upon whom the princess turned scrutinizing eyes , saying , '

138269	138332	138265	138265	you	4605	' The unhappy girls stood trembling . Ottilia spared them the leap into the gulfs of confession . Her intuitive glance , assisted by a combination of minor facts , had read the story of their misdeeds in a minute . She sent them down to the carriage , suffering her culprits to kiss her fingers ; while she said to one : '
138344	138572	138265	138265	you	4605	' When she was gone , after many fits of musing , the signification of it was revealed to my slower brain . I felt that it could not but be an additional shock to the regal pride of such a woman that these little maidens should have been permitted to act forcibly on her destiny . The mystery of the letters was easily explained as soon as a direct suspicion fell on one of the girls who lived in my neighbourhood and the other who was near the princess 's person . Doubtless the revelation of their effective mouse plot had its humiliating bitterness for her on a day of heavy oppression , smile at it as she subsequently might . The torture of heart with which I twisted the meaning of her words about the pair of mice to imply that the pair had conspired to make a net for an eagle and had enmeshed her , may have struck a vein of the truth . I could see no other antithesis to the laudable performance of the single mouse of fable . Lieschen , when she next appeared in the character of nurse , met my inquiries by supplicating me to imitate her sister 's generous mistress , and be merciful . She remarked by - and - by , of her own accord : '
138584	138612	138579	138579	she	432	' A tender warmth crept round me in thinking that a mind thus lofty would surely be , however severe in its insight , above regrets and recantations .

138806	138944	138803	138804	the prince	2912	' has a scene of young Frenchmen praising their horses . I myself am no stranger to the enthusiasm : one could not stake life and honour on a nobler brute . Pardon me if I state my opinion that you young Englishmen of to - day are sometimes rather overbearing in your assumption of a superior knowledge of horseflesh . We Germans in the Baltic provinces and in the Austrian cavalry think we have a right to a remark or two ; and if we have not suborned the testimony of modern history , the value of our Hanoverian troopers is not unknown to one at least of your Generals . However , the odds are that you were right and Otto wrong , and he certainly put himself in the wrong to defend his ground . '
139036	139047	139023	139023	I	0	' Your Highness , the mine flourishes , I trust ? '
139048	139060	139061	139061	he	4631	' It does ; I think I may say it does , '
139064	139143	139061	139061	he	4631	' There is always the want of capital . What can be accomplished , in the present state of affairs , your father performs , on the whole , well .

I had not to learn that the simplest visits and observations of ruling princes signify more than lies on the surface . Interests so highly personal as theirs demand from them a decent insincerity . Chancellor von Redwitz called on me , and amused me with secret anecdotes of all the royal Houses of Germany , amusing chiefly through the veneration he still entertained for them . The grave senior was doing his utmost to divert one of my years . The immoralities of blue blood , like the amours of the Gods , were to his mind tolerable , if not beneficial to mankind , and he presumed I should find them toothsome . Nay , he besought me to coincide in his excuses of a widely charming young archduchess , for whom no estimable husband of a fitting rank could anywhere be discovered , so she had to be bestowed upon an archducal imbecile ; and hence and hence Oh , certainly ! Generous youth and benevolent age joined hands of exoneration over her . The princess of Satteberg actually married , under covert , a colonel of Uhlans at the age of seventeen ; the marriage was quashed , the colonel vanished , the princess became the scandalous Duchess of Ilm - Ilm , and was surprised one infamous night in the outer court of the castle by a soldier on guard , who dragged her into the guard - room and unveiled her there , and would have been summarily shot for his pains but for the locket on his breast , which proved him to be his sovereign 's son . A perfect romance , Mr. Chancellor . We will say the soldier son loved a delicate young countess in attendance on the duchess . The countess spies the locket , takes it to the duchess , is reprimanded , when behold ! the locket opens , and Colonel von Bein appears as in his blooming youth , in Lancer uniform . Young sir , your piece of romance has exaggerated history to caricature . Romances are the destruction of human interest . The moment you begin to move the individuals , they are puppets . '

I should have premised that , besides mental , she had eminent moral dispositions , I might term it the conscience of her illustrious rank . She would have raised the poet to equal rank beside her had she possessed the power . She could and did defy the Family , and subdue her worshipping father , the most noble prince , to a form of paralysis of acquiescence if I make myself understood . But she was unsuccessful in her application for the sanction of the Diet . '
140264	140268	140017	140017	Your	4640	' The Diet ? '
140269	140527	140017	140017	Your	4640	' The German Diet . Have you not lived among us long enough to know that the German Diet is the seat of domestic legislation for the princely Houses of Germany ? A prince or a princess may say , " I will this or that . " The Diet says , " Thou shalt not " ; pre - eminently , " Thou shalt not mix thy blood with that of an impure race , nor with blood of inferiors . " Hence , we have it what we see it , a translucent flood down from the topmost founts of time . So we revere it . " Qua man and woman , " the Diet says , by implication , " do as you like , marry in the ditches , spawn plentifully . Qua prince and princess , No ! Your nuptials are nought . Or would you maintain them a legal ceremony , and be bound by them , you descend , you go forth ; you are no reigning sovereign , you are a private person . " His Serene Highness the prince was thus prohibited from affording help to his daughter . The princess was reduced to the decision either that she , the sole child born of him in legal wedlock , would render him qua prince childless , or that she would in short , would have her woman 's way . The sovereignty of Leiterstein continued uninterruptedly with the elder branch . She was a true princess . '

141807	141922	141802	141803	your father	1098	' I suggested that it might be because I was not his equal . She complimented me for inheriting a spark of Roy 's brilliancy . I fancied there was a conspiracy to force me back from my pretensions by subjecting me to the contemplation of my bare self and actual condition . Had there been , I should have suffered from less measured strokes . The unconcerted design to humiliate inferiors is commonly successfuller than conspiracy . The prince invited me to smoke with him , and talked of our gradual subsidence in England to one broad level of rank through the intermixture by marriage of our aristocracy , squirearchy , and merchants . '
141929	141933	141802	141803	your father	1098	' he said ; '
142033	142208	142210	142210	you	4731	' He asked me what I had made of Chancellor von Redwitz . I perceived that Prince Ernest could be cool and sagacious in repairing what his imprudence or blindness had left to occur : that he must have enlightened his daughter as to her actual position , and was most dexterously and devilishly flattering her worldly good sense by letting it struggle and grow , instead of opposing her . His appreciation of her intellect was an idolatry ; he really confided in it , I knew ; and this reacted upon her . Did it ? My hesitations and doubts , my fantastic raptures and despair , my loss of the power to appreciate anything at its right value , revealed the madness of loving a princess . There were preparations for the arrival of an important visitor . The margravine spoke of him emphatically . I thought it might be her farcically pompous way of announcing my father 's return , and looked pleased , I suppose , for she added , '
142400	142472	142380	142380	he	556	' I scrutinized Prince Hermann as rarely my observation had dwelt on any man . He had the German head , wide , so as seemingly to force out the ears ; honest , ready , interested eyes in conversation ; parched lips ; a rather tropically - coloured skin ; and decidedly the manners of a gentleman to all , excepting his retinue of secretaries , valets , and chasseurs his '
142475	142491	142492	142492	You	4743	' he called them . They liked him . One could not help liking him . '
142496	142507	142508	142508	I	0	' he addressed the princess at table . She answered : '
142525	142611	142514	142514	you	4744	' From that time the topics started on every occasion were theirs ; the rest of us ran at their heels , giving tongue or not . To me Prince Hermann was perfectly courteous . He had made English friends on his travels ; he preferred English comrades in adventure to any other : thought our East Indian empire the most marvellous thing the world had seen , and our Indian Government cigars very smokeable upon acquaintance . When stirred , he bubbled with anecdote . '
142616	142894	142514	142514	you	4744	' was his reply to the margravine 's tentatives for gossip of this and that of the German Courts . His museum , hunting , and the Opera absorbed and divided his hours . I guessed his age to be mounting forty . He seemed robust ; he ate vigorously . Drinking he conscientiously performed as an accompanying duty , and was flushed after dinner , burning for tobacco and a couch for his length . Then he talked of the littleness of Europe and the greatness of Germany ; logical postulates fell in collapse before him . America to America , North and South ; India to Europe . India was for the land with the largest sea - board . Mistress of the Baltic , of the North Sea and the East , as eventually she must be , Germany would claim to take India as a matter of course , and find an outlet for the energies of the most prolific and the toughest of the races of mankind , the purest , in fact , the only true race , properly so called , out of India , to which it would return as to its source , and there create an empire magnificent in force and solidity , the actual wedding of East and West ; an empire firm on the ground and in the blood of the people , instead of an empire of aliens , that would bear comparison to a finely fretted cotton - hung palanquin balanced on an elephant 's back , all depending on the docility of the elephant his description of Great Britain 's Indian Empire . '
142899	142903	142897	142897	me	0	' he said , '
142959	143074	143075	143075	We	4751	' This was the man : a milder one after the evaporation of his wine in speech , and peculiarly moderate on his return , exhaling sandal - wood , to the society of the ladies . Ottilia danced with Prince Hermann at the grand Ball given in honour of him . The wives and daughters of the notables present kept up a buzz of comment on his personal advantages , in which , I heard it said , you saw his German heart , though he had spent the best years of his life abroad . Much court was paid to him by the men . Sarkeld visibly expressed satisfaction . One remark , '
143084	143247	143075	143075	We	4751	' left me no doubt upon the presumed object of his visit : it was uttered and responded to with a depth of sentiment that showed how lively would be the general gratitude toward one who should exhilarate the place by introducing cases of fish - bones . So little did he think of my presence , that returning from a ride one day , he seized and detained the princess 's hand . She frowned with pained surprise , but unresistingly , as became a young gentlewoman 's dignity . Her hand was rudely caught and kept in the manner of a boisterous wooer a Harry the Fifth or lusty Petruchio . She pushed her horse on at a bound . Prince Hermann rode up head to head with her gallantly , having now both hands free of the reins , like an Indian spearing the buffalo it was buffalo courtship ; and his shout of rallying astonishment at her resistance , '
143252	143504	143075	143075	We	4751	' rang wildly to heighten the scene , she leaning constrained on one side and he bending half his body 's length ; a strange scene for me to witness . They proceeded with old Schwartz at their heels doglike . It became a question for me whether I should follow in the bitter track , and further the question whether I could let them escape from sight . They wound up the roadway , two figures and one following , now dots against the sky , now a single movement in the valley , now concealed , buried under billows of forest , making the low noising of the leaves an intolerable whisper of secresy , and forward I rushed again to see them rounding a belt of firs or shadowed by rocks , solitary on shorn fields , once more dipping to the forest , and once more emerging , vanishing . When I had grown sure of their reappearance from some point of view or other , I spied for them in vain . My destiny , whatever it might be , fluttered over them ; to see them seemed near the knowing of it , and not to see them , deadly . I galloped , so intent on the three in the distance , that I did not observe a horseman face toward me , on the road : it was Prince Hermann . He raised his hat ; I stopped short , and he spoke : '
143851	143979	143980	143980	She	4767	' We saluted gravely , and I rode on at a mechanical pace , discerning by glimpses the purport of what I had heard , without drawing warmth from it . The man 's outrageously royal way of wooing , in contempt of minor presences and flimsy sentiment , made me jealous of him , notwithstanding his overthrow . I was in the mood to fall entirely into my father 's hands , as I did by unbosoming myself to him for the first time since my heart had been under the charm . Fresh from a rapid course of travel , and with the sense of laying the prince under weighty obligations , he made light of my perplexity , and at once delivered himself bluntly : '
143994	144003	143980	143980	She	4767	' His plans were shaped on the spot . '
144115	144670	144671	144671	You	4778	' He informed me that his foresight had enlisted and detained Peterborough for this particular moment and identical piece of duty , which seemed possible , and in a singular manner incited me to make use of Peterborough . For the princess still denied me the look of love 's intelligence , she avoided me , she still kept to the riddle , and my delicacy went so far that I was restrained from writing . I agreed with my father that we could not remain in Germany ; but how could I quit the field and fly to England on such terms ? I composed the flattest letter ever written , requesting the princess to meet me about midnight in the library , that I might have the satisfaction of taking my leave of her ; and this done , my spirits rose , and it struck me my father was practically wise , and I looked on Peterborough as an almost supernatural being . If Ottilia refused to come , at least I should know my fate . Was I not bound in manly honour to be to some degree adventurous ? So I reasoned in exclamations , being , to tell truth , tired of seeming to be what I was not quite , of striving to become what I must have divined that I never could quite attain to . So my worthier , or ideal , self fell away from me . I was no longer devoted to be worthy of a woman 's love , but consenting to the plot to entrap a princess . I was somewhat influenced , too , by the consideration , which I regarded as a glimpse of practical wisdom , that Prince Ernest was guilty of cynical astuteness in retaining me as his guest under manifold disadvantages . Personal pride stood up in arms , and my father 's exuberant spirits fanned it . He dwelt loudly on his services to the prince , and his own importance and my heirship to mighty riches . He made me almost believe that Prince Ernest hesitated about rejecting me ; nor did it appear altogether foolish to think so , or why was I at the palace ? I had no head for reflections . My father diverted me by levelling the whole battery of his comic mind upon Peterborough , who had a heap of manuscript , directed against heretical German theologians , to pack up for publication in his more congenial country : how different , he ejaculated , from this nest this forest of heresy , where pamphlets and critical essays were issued without let or hindrance , and , as far as he could see , no general reprobation of the Press , such as would most undoubtedly , with one voice , hail any strange opinions in our happy land at home ! Whether he really understood the function my father prepared him for , I can not say . The invitation to dine and pass a night at the lake - palace flattered him immensely . We went up to the chateau to fetch him . A look of woe was on Peterborough 's countenance when we descended at the palace portals : he had forgotten his pipe . '
144680	144690	144671	144671	You	4778	' my father said . Peterborough remarked to me , '

Yet , supposing her inclination to have become diverted , I was ready frankly to release her with one squeeze of hands and take all the pain of she pain , and I said : '

We had our full draught of the divine self - oblivion which floated those ghosts of the two immortal lovers through the bounds of their purgatorial circle , and for us to whom the minutes were ages , as for them to whom all time was unmarked , the power of supreme love swept out circumstance . Such embraces cast the soul beyond happiness , into no known region of sadness , but we drew apart sadly , even as that involved pair of bleeding recollections looked on the life lost to them . I knew well what a height she dropped from when the senses took fire . She raised me to learn how little of fretful thirst and its reputed voracity remains with love when it has been met midway in air by a winged mate able to sustain , unable to descend farther . And it was before a witness , though unviewed by us . The farewell had come . Her voice was humbled . Never , I said , delighting in the now conscious bravery of her eyes engaging mine , shadowy with the struggle , I would never doubt her , and I renounced all pledges . To be clear in my own sight as well as in hers , I made mention of the half - formed conspiracy to obtain her plighted troth in a binding manner . It was not necessary for me to excuse myself ; she did that , saying , '

The corners of the mouth would often be in movement , setting dimples at work in her cheek , while the brows remained fixed , and thus at times a tender meditative air was given her that I could not think her own . Upon what could she possibly reflect ? She had not a care , she had no education , she could hardly boast an idea two at a time I was sure she never had entertained . The sort of wife for a fox - hunting lord , I summed up , and hoped he would be a good fellow . Peterborough was plied by the squire for a description of German women . Blushing and shooting a timid look from under his pendulous eyelids at my aunt , indicating that he was prepared to go the way of tutors at Riversley , he said he really had not much observed them .

The fiction , that so much having been said , an immediate show of reserve on such topics preserved her in ignorance of them , was one she subscribed to merely to humour the squire . I was half in doubt whether I disliked or admired her want of decent hypocrisy . She allowed him to suppose that she did not hear , but spoke as a party to the conversation . My aunt Dorothy blamed Julia . The squire thundered at Heriot ; Janet , liking both , contented herself with impartial comments . '

She asked me whether it was not dismal for one who was called a grass widow , and was in reality a salt - water one , to keep fresh , with a lapdog , a cook , and a maid - servant , and a postman that passed the gate twenty times for twice that he opened it , and nothing to look for but this disappointing creature day after day ! At first she was shy , stole out a coy line of fingers to be shaken , and lisped ; and out of that mood came right - about - face , with an exclamation of regret that she supposed she must not kiss me now . I projected , she drew back . '

I fear , Harry , it will half break our dear old grandada 's heart . He is rough , and you have often been against him , for one unfortunate reason .

Sewis danced with the handsomest lass , swung her to supper , and delivered an extraordinary speech , entirely concerning me , and rather to my discomposure , particularly so when it was my fate to hear that the old man had made me the heir of his savings . Such was his announcement , in a very excited voice , but incidentally upon a solemn adjuration to the squire to beware of his temper govern his temper and not be a turncoat . We were present at the head of the supper - table to hear our healths drunk . Sewis spoke like a half - caste oblivious of his training , and of the subjects he was at liberty to touch on as well . Evidently there was a weight of foreboding on his mind . He knew his master well . The squire excused him under the ejaculation , '

I tried the system on him with good effect during our stay in London ; that is , I took upon myself to be always cool , always courteous , deliberate in my replies , and not uncordial , though I was for representing the reserved young man . I obtained some praise for my style and bearing among his acquaintances . To one lady passing an encomium on me , he said , '
156850	157147	157148	157148	She	5160	' which seemed to me of good augury . My friends Temple and Heriot were among the Riversley guests at Christmas . We rode over to John Thresher 's , of whom we heard that the pretty Mabel Sweetwinter had disappeared , and understood that suspicion had fallen upon one of us gentlemen . Bob , her brother , had gone the way of the bravest English fellows of his class - to America . We called on the miller , a soured old man . Bob 's evasion affected him more than Mabel 's , Martha Thresher said , in derision of our sex . I was pained to hear from her that Bob supposed me the misleader of his sister ; and that he had , as she believed , left England , to avoid the misery of ever meeting me again , because he liked me so much . She had been seen walking down the lanes with some one resembling me in figure . Heriot took the miller 's view , counting the loss of one stout young Englishman to his country of far greater importance than the escapades of dozens of girls , for which simple creatures he had no compassion : he held the expression of it a sham . He had grown coxcombical . Without talking of his conquests , he talked largely of the ladies who were possibly in the situation of victims to his grace of person , though he did not do so with any unctuous boasting . On the contrary , there was a rather taking undertone of regret that his enfeebled over - fat country would give her military son no worthier occupation . He laughed at the mention of Julia Bulsted 's name . '

She appeared distressed , and courted a change of expression in his features , and I have to confess that never having seen her gaze upon any one save myself in that fashion , which was with her very winning , especially where some of her contralto tones of remonstrance or entreaty aided it , I felt as a man does at a neighbour 's shadow cast over his rights of property . Heriot dropped to the rear : I was glad to leave her with Temple , and glad to see them canter ahead together on the sand of tie heaths . '

But I have always respected her , and that 's not of course . Depend upon it , a woman who can be a friend of men is the right sort of woman to make a match with . Do you suppose she could n't have a dozen fellows round her at the lift of her finger ? the pick of the land ! I 'd trust her with an army . I tell you , Janet Ilchester 's the only girl alive who 'll double the man she marries . I do n't know another who would n't make the name of wife laugh the poor devil out of house and company . She 's firm as a rock ; and sweet as a flower on it ! Will that touch you ? Bah ! Richie , let 's talk like men . I feel for her because she 's fond of you , and I know what it is when a girl like that sets her heart on a fellow . There , '
158333	158352	158330	158330	he	5195	' I 'd ask you to go down on your knees and pray before you decide against her ! '

158621	158687	158603	158603	Janet	356	' Well , it 's all right , Harry ? Now you 'll be happy , I hope . I did not shine in my reply . Her amiable part appeared to be to let me see how brilliant and gracious the commonplace could be made to look . She kept Heriot at the Grange , against the squire 's remonstrance and her mother 's . '
158712	158813	158816	158816	she	5206	' she said , with astounding fatuity . He submitted , and seemed to like it . She must be teaching Temple to skate figures in the frost , with a great display of good - humoured patience , and her voice at musical pitches . But her principal affectation was to talk on matters of business with Mr. Burgin and Mr. Trewint , the squire 's lawyer and bailiff , on mines and interest , on money and economical questions ; not shrinking from politics either , until the squire cries out to the males assisting in the performance , '
158830	158990	158816	158816	she	5206	' and they servilely joined their fragmentary capitals in agreement . She went so far as to retain Peterborough to teach her Latin . He was idling in the expectation of a living in the squire 's gift . The annoyance for me was that I could not detach myself from a contemplation of these various scenes , by reverting to my life in Germany . The preposterous closing of my interview with Ottilia blocked the way , and I was unable to write to her unable to address her even in imagination , without pangs of shame at the review of the petty conspiracy I had sanctioned to entrap her to plight her hand to me , and without perpetually multiplying excuses for my conduct . So to escape them I was reduced to study Janet , forming one of her satellites . She could say to me impudently , with all the air of a friendly comrade , '
159000	159111	158998	158998	Harry	245	' She flew she was always on the chase . I saw her permit Heriot to kiss her hand , and then the squire appeared , and Heriot and she burst into laughter , and the squire , with a puzzled face , would have the game explained to him , but understood not a bit of it , only growled at me ; upon which Janet became serious and chid him . I was told by my aunt Dorothy to admire this behaviour of hers . One day she certainly did me a service : a paragraph in one of the newspapers spoke of my father , not flatteringly : '
159119	159172	159112	159112	Richmond	238	' it commenced . The squire was waiting for her to hand the paper to him . None of us could comprehend why she played him off and denied him his right to the first perusal of the news ; she was voluble , almost witty , full of sprightly Roxalana petulance . '
159176	159180	159112	159112	Richmond	238	' she said , '
159186	159526	159112	159112	Richmond	238	' and she was allowed to burn it money article , mining column as well on the pretext of an infamous anti - Tory leader , of which she herself composed the first sentence to shock the squire completely . I had sight of that paper some time afterwards . Richmond was in the field again , it stated , with mock flourishes . But that was not the worst . My grandfather 's name was down there , and mine , and Princess Ottilia 's . My father 's connection with the court of Eppenwelzen - Sarkeld was alluded to as the latest , and next to his winning the heiress of Riversley , the most successful of his ventures , inasmuch as his son , if rumour was to be trusted , had obtained the promise of the hand of the princess . The paragraph was an excerpt from a gossiping weekly journal , perhaps less malevolent than I thought it . There was some fun to be got out of a man who , the journal in question was informed , had joined the arms of England and a petty German principality stamped on his plate and furniture . My gratitude to Janet was fervent enough when I saw what she had saved me from . I pressed her hand and held it . I talked stupidly , but I made my cruel position intelligible to her , and she had the delicacy , on this occasion , to keep her sentiments regarding my father unuttered . We sat hardly less than an hour side by side I know not how long hand in hand . The end was an extraordinary trembling in the limb abandoned to me . It seized her frame . I would have detained her , but it was plain she suffered both in her heart and her pride . Her voice was under fair command - more than mine was . She counselled me to go to London , at once . '
159540	159605	159538	159538	Harry	238	' for the purpose of checking my father 's extravagances , would have been the further wording , which she spared me ; and I thanked her , wishing , at the same time , that she would get the habit of using choicer phrases whenever there might , by chance , be a stress of emotion between us . Her trembling , and her '
159611	159692	159606	159606	I	0	' came into unpleasant collision in the recollection . I acknowledge to myself that she was a true and hearty friend . She listened with interest to my discourse on the necessity of my being in Parliament before I could venture to propose formally for the hand of the princess , and undertook to bear the burden of all consequent negotiations with my grandfather . If she would but have allowed me to speak of Temple , instead of saying , '
159704	159760	159698	159698	I	0	' at the very mention of his name , I should have sincerely felt my indebtedness to her , and some admiration of her fine spirit and figure besides . I could not even agree with my aunt Dorothy that Janet was handsome . When I had to grant her a pardon I appreciated her better .

The Papacy , I can assure you , finds as little favour with one as with the other . Yes , I held forth , as you would say , from time to time .

He drank his ale from the hands of Sillabin , our impassive new butler , who had succeeded Sewis , the squire told him , like a Whig Ministry the Tory ; proof that things were not improving . '

He regretted extremely that he could not enjoy so excellent a trial of his patience , but he felt himself bound to go to his post and wait . I walked over to Bulsted with him , and heard on the way that it was Heriot who had called for her and driven her off . '

164518	164714	164516	164517	My bankers	5212	' book had been the theme all the morning , and an astonishing one to me equally with my grandfather : Since our arrival in England , my father had drawn nine thousand pounds . The sums expended during our absence on the Continent reached the perplexing figures of forty - eight thousand . I knew it too likely , besides , that all debts were not paid . Self self self drew for thousands at a time ; sometimes , as the squire 's convulsive forefinger indicated , for many thousands within a week . It was incomprehensible to him until I , driven at bay by questions and insults , and perceiving that concealment could not long be practised , made a virtue of the situation by telling him what he in fact must have seen that my father possessed a cheque - book as well as I , and likewise drew upon the account . We had required the money ; it was mine , and I had sold out Bank Stock and Consols , which gave very poor interest , I remarked cursorily - and had kept the money at my bankers '

Besides I was engaged in watching my father , whose bearing toward the ladies he accosted did not dissatisfy my critical taste , though I had repeated fears of seeing him overdo it . He summoned me to an introduction to the Countess Szezedy , a merry little Hungarian dame . '

168381	168435	168438	168440	the young suitor	5467	' she said . Before I could demand explanations of my father with regard to this terrible rumour involving Ottilia , I found myself in the box of the City widow , Lady Sampleman , a grievous person , of the complexion of the autumnal bramble - leaf , whose first words were : '
168449	168467	168445	168447	our German princess	5469	' I had to reply that the theme was more of German princes than princesses in England . '
168472	168476	168477	168477	you	5470	' said she , '
168511	168563	168564	168564	she	5474	'm dying for a sight of her portrait . Captain DeWitt declares her heavenly I mean , he says she is fair and nice , quite a lady - that of course ! And never mind her not being rich . You can do the decoration to the match . H'm , '
168569	168617	168564	168564	she	5474	' pale ! Lovelorn ? Excuse an old friend of your father 's . One of his very oldest , I 'd say , if it did n't impugn . As such , proud of your alliance . I am . I speak of it everywhere everywhere . '
168627	168679	168619	168619	she	5474	' Have you heard the news ? No , what ? Fitz - George 's son marries a princess of the German realm . Indeed ! True as gospel . And how soon ? In a month ; and now you will see the dear , neglected man command the Court .... '
168732	168738	168740	168740	he	925	' If it were not , '
168742	168912	168740	168740	he	925	' for the Chassediane you are aware , Richie , poor Jorian is lost to her ? he has fallen at her quicksilver feet . She is now in London . Half the poor fellow 's income expended in bouquets ! Her portrait , in the character of the widow Lefourbe , has become a part of his dressing apparatus ; he shaves fronting her playbill . His first real affaire de coeur , and he is forty - five ! So he is taken in the stomach . That is why love is such a dangerous malady for middle age . As I said , but for Jenny Chassediane , our Sampleman would be the fortune for Jorian . I have hinted it on both sides . Women , Richie , are cleverer than the illustrious Lord Nelson in not seeing what their inclinations decline to see , and Jorian would do me any service in the world except that one . You are restless , my son ? '

169705	169874	169699	169699	he	5508	' a breadth in London ; nowhere else do I breathe with absolute freedom so largely : and this is my battlefield . By the way , Lady Edbury accounts you complete ; which is no more to say than that she is a woman of taste . The instance : she positively would not notice that you wear a dress - coat of a foreign cut . Correct it to - morrow ; my tailor shall wait on you . I meant to point out to you that when a London woman has not taken note of that , the face and the man have made the right impression on her . Richie , dear boy , how shall I speak the delight I have in seeing you ! My arm in yours , old Richie ! strolling home from the Fashion : this seems to me what I dreamt of !

171112	171227	171231	171233	as many people	5564	' He repeated several times before he reached his housedoor , that he wanted his wine , in a manner to be almost alarming . His unwonted effort of memory , the singular pictures of him which it had flashed before me , and a sort of impatient compassion , made me forget my wrath . I saw him take his restorative at one draught . He lay down on a sofa , and his valet drew his boots off and threw a cloak over him . Lying there , he wished me gaily good - night . Mrs. Waddy told me that he had adopted this system of sleeping for the last month . '
171245	171295	171229	171229	you	5563	' she said ; and I was induced to suppose he had some connection with the Press . She had implicit faith in his powers of constitution , and would affirm , that he had been the death of dozens whom the attraction had duped to imitate his habits . '

The report of the house - door frequently shutting in the night suggested the passage of his aides - de - camp . Early in the morning , I found him pacing through the open doors of the dining - room and the library dictating to a secretary at a desk , now and then tossing a word to Dettermain and Newson 's chief clerk . The floor was strewn with journals . He wore Hessian boots ; a voluminous black cloak hung loosely from his shoulders . '

Why did my name appear in the papers ? Because I was his son . But he assured me that he carefully separated me from public companionship with his fortunes , and placed me on the side of my grandfather , as a plain gentleman of England , the heir of the most colossal wealth possible in the country .

171964	172150	171958	171958	your	3597	' He shook me by both hands . I was touched with pity , and at the same time in doubt whether it was not an actor that swayed me ; for I was discontented , and could not speak my discontent ; I was overborne , overflowed . His evasion of the matter of my objections relating to the princess I felt to be a palpable piece of artfulness , but I had to acknowledge to myself that I knew what his argument would be , and how overwhelmingly his defence of it would spring forth . My cowardice shrank from provoking a recurrence to the theme . In fact , I submitted consciously to his masterful fluency and emotional power , and so I was carried on the tide with him , remaining in London several days to witness that I was not the only one . My father , admitting that money served him in his conquest of society , and defying any other man to do as much with it as he did , replied to a desperate insinuation of mine , '
172173	172178	172170	172171	your grandad	8064	' He murmured confidentially , '

172385	172543	172377	172377	Royal	5594	' I read a paragraph in which Ottilia 's name and titles were set down ; then followed mine and my wealthy heirship , and woe was me in the perusing of it ! a roundabout vindication of me as one not likely to be ranked as the first of English commoners who had gained the hand of an hereditary foreign princess , though it was undoubtedly in the light of a commoner that I was most open to the congratulations of my countrymen upon my unparalleled felicity . A display of historical erudition cited the noble inferiors by birth who had caught princesses to their arms Charles , Humphrey , William , John . Under this list , a later Harry ! The paragraph closed by fixing the nuptials to take place before the end of the Season . I looked at my father to try a struggle with him . The whole man was efflorescent . '
172550	172583	172377	172377	Royal	5594	' I implored him . He signified the impossibility in a burst of gesticulations , motions of the mouth , smiling frowns ; various patterns of an absolute negative beating down opposition . '
172657	172785	172651	172651	He	5599	' my father exclaimed , seeing me swing my shoulder round , and he made me feel that it would have been a false oath if I had sworn it . But I could have sworn , that I had rather we two were at the bottom of the sea than that it should come under the princess 's eyes . I read it again . It was in print . It looked like reality . It was at least the realization of my dream . But this played traitor and accused me of being crowned with no more than a dream . The sole practical thing I could do was to insist on our starting for Riversley immediately , to make sure of my own position . '
172792	172886	172790	172790	Richie	448	' my father said confidently : and we waited . A rather plainer view of my father 's position , as I inclined to think , was afforded to me one morning at his breakfast - table , by a conversation between him and Jorian DeWitt , who brought me a twisted pink note from Mdlle . Chassediane , the which he delivered with the air of a dog made to disgorge a bone , and he was very cool to me indeed . The cutlets of Alphonse were subject to snappish criticism . '

Jorian threw back his head as though to discharge a spiteful sarcasm with good aim ; but turning to me , said , '

The squire directed Uberly , acting as his groom , to walk his horse up and down the turf fronting young Tom Eckerthy 's cottage , and me to remain where I was ; then hobbled up to the door , followed at a leisurely march by my father . The door opened . My father swept the old man in before him , with a bow and flourish that admitted of no contradiction , and the door closed on them . I caught a glimpse of Uberly screwing his wrinkles in a queer grimace , while he worked his left eye and thumb expressively at the cottage , by way of communicating his mind to Samuel , Captain Bulsted 's coachman ; and I became quite of his opinion as to the nature of the meeting , that it was comical and not likely to lead to much . I thought of the princess and of my hope of her depending upon such an interview as this . From that hour when I stepped on the sands of the Continent to the day of my quitting them , I had been folded in a dream : I had stretched my hands to the highest things of earth , and here now was the retributive material money - question , like a keen scythe - blade ! The cottage - door continued shut . The heaths were darkening . I heard a noise of wheels , and presently the unmistakable voice of Janet saying , '

It was not the wisest of speeches , and happened , Captain Bulsted informed me , to be delivered in my father 's manner , for the squire pronounced emphatically that he saw very little Beltham in me . The right course would have been for me to ask him then and there whether I had his consent to start for Germany . But I was the sport of resentments and apprehensions ; and , indeed , I should not have gone . I could not go without some title beyond that of the heir of great riches . Janet kept out of my sight . I found myself strangely anxious to console her : less sympathetic , perhaps , than desirous to pour out my sympathy in her ear , which was of a very pretty shape , with a soft unpierced lobe . We danced together at the Riversley Ball , given by the squire on the night of my father 's Ball in London . Janet complimented me upon having attained wisdom . '

179485	179566	179471	179471	he	925	' They believe in me . I have de facto harnessed them to my fortunes ; and if you doubt me on the point of success , I refer you to Dettermain and Newson . All I stipulate for is to maintain my position in society to throw a lustre on my Case . So much I must do . My failures hitherto have been entirely owing to the fact that I had not my son to stand by me . '

179594	179635	179636	179636	he	5812	' I admit the necessity for it , my son . Say you hand me a cheque for a temporary thousand . Your credit and mine in conjunction can replace it before the expiration of the two months . Or , '
179639	179719	179636	179636	he	5812	' it might be better to give a bond or so to a professional lender , and preserve the account at your bankers intact . The truth is , I have , in my interview with the squire , drawn in advance upon the material success I have a perfect justification to anticipate , and I can not allow the old gentleman to suppose that I retrench for the purpose of giving a large array of figures to your bankers '

The power of his persuasiveness in speech , backed by the spectacle of his social accomplishments , continued to subdue me , and I protested only inwardly even when I knew that he was gambling with fortune . I wrote out many cheques , and still it appeared to me that they were barely sufficient to meet the current expenses of his household . Temple and I calculated that his Grand Parade would try the income of a duke , and could but be a matter of months . Mention of it reached Riversley from various quarters , from Lady Maria Higginson , from Captain Bulsted and his wife , and from Sir Roderick Ilchester , who said to me , with fine accentuation , '

The squire listened like one pelted by a storm , sure of his day to come at the close of the two months . I gained his commendation by shunning the metropolitan Balls , nor did my father press me to appear at them . It was tacitly understood between us that I should now and then support him at his dinner - table , and pass bowing among the most select of his great ladies . And this I did , and I felt at home with them , though I had to bear with roughnesses from one or two of the more venerable dames , which were not quite proper to good breeding . Old Lady Kane , great - aunt of the Marquis of Edbury , was particularly my tormentor , through her plain - spoken comments on my father 's legal suit ; for I had to listen to her without wincing , and agree in her general contempt of the Georges , and foil her queries coolly , when I should have liked to perform Jorian DeWitt 's expressed wish to '
180827	180835	180501	180502	your father	1098	' She took extraordinary liberties with me . '

Her world and its outskirts she knew thoroughly , even to the fact of my grandfather 's desire that I should marry Janet Ilchester . She named a duke 's daughter , an earl 's . Of course I should have to stop the scandal : otherwise the choice I had was unrestricted . My father she evidently disliked , but she just as much disliked an encounter with his invincible bonhomie and dexterous tongue . She hinted at family reasons for being shy of him , assuring me that I was not implicated in them . '
180998	181048	181049	181049	Her	5856	' she said , and it consoled me with the thought that he was not ranked as an adventurer in the houses he entered . I learned that he was supposed to depend chiefly on my vast resources . Edbury acted the part of informant to the inquisitive harridan : '
181075	181225	181226	181226	I	0	' She had cast her eye on Anna Penrhys , but considered her antecedents doubtful . Spotless innocence was the sole receipt for Edbury 's malady . My father , in a fit of bold irony , proposed Lady Kane for President of his Tattle and Scandal Club , a club of ladies dotted with select gentlemen , the idea of which Jorian DeWitt claimed the merit of starting , and my father surrendered it to him , with the reservation , that Jorian intended an association of backbiters pledged to reveal all they knew , whereas the Club , in its present form , was an engine of morality and decency , and a social safeguard , as well as an amusement . It comprised a Committee of Investigation , and a Court of Appeal ; its object was to arraign slander . Lady Kane declined the honour . '
181232	181464	181226	181226	I	0	' she said to me , and spoke of where dirty linen should be washed , and was distressingly broad in her innuendoes concerning Edbury 's stepmother . This Club sat and became a terror for a month , adding something to my father 's reputation . His inexhaustible conversational art and humour gave it such vitality as it had . Ladies of any age might apply for admission when well seconded : gentlemen under forty - five years were rigidly excluded , and the seniors must also have passed through the marriage ceremony . Outside tattle and scandal declared , that the Club was originated to serve as a club for Lady Edbury , but I chose to have no opinion upon what I knew nothing of . These matters were all ephemeral , and freaks ; they produced , however , somewhat of the same effect on me as on my father , in persuading me that he was born for the sphere he occupied , and rendering me rather callous as to the sources of ways and means . I put my name to a bond for several thousand pounds , in conjunction with Lord Edbury , thinking my father right in wishing to keep my cheque - book unworried , lest the squire should be seized with a spasm of curiosity before the two months were over . '
181472	181625	181468	181468	I	0	' my father said repeatedly . He did not say how : I had the suspicion that he did not know . His confidence and my growing recklessness acted in unison . Happily the newspapers were quiet . I hoped consequently to find peace at Riversley ; but there the rumours of the Grand Parade were fabulous , thanks to Captain Bulsted and Julia , among others . These two again provoked an outbreak of rage from the squire , and I , after hearing them , was almost disposed to side with him ; they suggested an inexplicable magnificence , and created an image of a man portentously endowed with the capacity to throw dust in the eyes . No description of the Balls could have furnished me with such an insight of their brilliancy as the consuming ardour they awakened in the captain and his wife . He reviewed them : '

My father was accused of having stood up at a public dinner and returned thanks on behalf of an Estate of the Realm : it read monstrously . I ceased to think of the suffering inflicted on me by my grandfather . Janet and I , side by side with the captain and Julia , carried on the game of battledore and shuttlecock , in a match to see whether the unmarried could keep the shuttle flying as long as the married , with varying fortunes . She gazed on me , to give me the comfort of her sympathy , too much , and I was too intent on the vision of my father either persecuted by lies or guilty of hideous follies , to allow the match to be a fair one . So Julia could inform the squire that she and William had given the unmarried pair a handsome beating , when he appeared peeping round one of the shed - pillars . '

184645	184805	184639	184639	her	5949	' Wedderburn replied .

The form of humour to express the speed of the world was common , but it struck me as a terrible illustration of my father 's . I had still a sense of pleasure in the thought that these intimates of his were gentlemen who relished and , perhaps , really liked him . They were not parasites ; not the kind of men found hanging about vulgar profligates . I quitted them . Sir Weeton Slater walked half - a - dozen steps beside me . '

The worthy baronet struggled to impart his meaning , which was , that he would have me define something like an allowance to my father , not so much for the purpose of curtailing his expenditure he did not venture upon private ground as to bridle my father 's ideas of things possible for a private gentleman in this country . In that character none were like him . As to his suit , or appeal , he could assure me that Serjeant Wedderburn , and all who would or could speak on the subject , saw no prospect of success ; not any . The worst of it was , that it caused my father to commit himself in sundry ways . It gave a handle to his enemies . It he glanced at me indicatively . I thanked the well - meaning gentleman without encouraging him to continue . '

I had no power to conjure up the princess . Jorian DeWitt was the man I wanted to see . After applications at his Club and lodgings I found him dragging his Burgundy leg in the Park , on his road to pay a morning visit to his fair French enchantress . I impeached him , and he pleaded guilty , clearly not wishing to take me with him , nor would he give me Mlle . Jenny 's address , which I had . By virtue of the threat that I would accompany him if he did not satisfy me , I managed to extract the story of the Dauphin , aghast at the discovery of its being true . The fatal after - dinner speech he believed to have been actually spoken , and he touched on that first . '

I walked down to the Chambers where Temple was reading Law , for a refuge from these annoyances . I was in love with the modest shadowed life Temple lived , diligently reading , and glancing on the world as through a dusky window , happy to let it run its course while he sharpened his weapons . A look at Temple 's face told me he had heard quite as much as was known in the West . Dining - halls of lawyers are not Cistercian ; he was able to give me three distinct versions of the story of the Dauphin . No one could be friendlier . Indeed Temple now urged me forcibly to prevent my father from spending money and wearing his heart out in vain , by stopping the case in Dettermain and Newson 's hands . They were respectable lawyers , he said , in a lawyer 's ordinary tone when including such of his species as are not black sheep . He thought it possible that my father 's personal influence overbore their judgment . In fact , nothing bound them to refuse to work for him , and he believed that they had submitted their views for his consideration . '
186180	186184	186174	186174	he	0	' Temple exclaimed . '

186258	186281	186282	186283	Roy Richmond	609	' Temple spoke of the clever young barrister Tenby as the man whom his father had heard laughing over the trick played upon '
186285	186803	186282	186283	Roy Richmond	609	' I conceived that I might furnish Mr. Tenby a livelier kind of amusement , and the thought that I had once been sur le terrain , and had bitterly regretted it , by no means deterred me from the idea of a second expedition , so black was my mood . A review of the circumstances , aided by what reached my ears before the night went over , convinced me that Edbury was my man . His subordinate helped him to the instrument , and possibly to the plot , but Edbury was the capital offender . The scene of the prank was not in itself so bad as the stuff which a cunning anecdotist could make out of it . Edbury invited my father to a dinner at a celebrated City tavern . He kept his guests Jennings , Jorian DeWitt , Alton , Wedderburn , were among the few I was acquainted with who were present awaiting the arrival of a person for whom he professed extraordinary respect . The Dauphin of France was announced . A mild , flabby , amiable - looking old person , with shelving forehead and grey locks excellently built for the object , Jorian said entered . The Capet head and embonpoint were there . As far as a personal resemblance might go , his pretensions to be the long - lost Dauphin were grotesquely convincing , for , notwithstanding the accurate picture of the Family presented by him , the man was a pattern bourgeois : a sturdy impostor , one would have thought , and I thought so when I heard of him ; but I have been assured that he had actually grown old in the delusion that he , carrying on his business in the City of London , was the identical Dauphin . Edbury played his part by leading his poor old victim half way to meet his other most honoured guest , hesitating then and craving counsel whether he was right in etiquette to advance the Dauphin so far . The Dauphin left him mildly to decide the point : he was eminently mild throughout , and seems to have thought himself in good faith surrounded by believers and adherents . Edbury 's task soon grew too delicate for that coarse boy . In my father 's dexterous hands he at once lost his assumption of the gallantry of manner which could alone help him to retain his advantage . When the wine was in him he began to bawl . I could imagine the sort of dialogue he raised . Bets on the Dauphin , bets on Roy : they were matched as on a racecourse . The Dauphin remembered incidents of his residence in the Temple , with a beautiful juvenile faintness : a conscientious angling for recollection , Wedderburn said . Roy was requested to remember something , to drink and refresh his memory infantine incidents were suggested . He fenced the treacherous host during dinner with superb complacency . The Dauphin was of an immoveable composure . He '
186827	186914	186915	186915	I	0	' For this deliverance , somewhat to the consternation of the others , he offered up a short prayer of thanksgiving over his plate . He had , he said , encountered incredulity . He had his proofs . He who had never been on the soil of France since early boyhood , spoke French with a pure accent : he had the physical and moral constitution of the Family : owing to events attending his infant days , he was timid . Jorian imitated him : '
186953	187431	186949	186951	my Beautiful Mother	5992	' His French was quaint , but not absurd . He became loquacious , apostrophizing vacancy with uplifted hand and eye . The unwonted invitation to the society of noblemen made him conceive his Dauphinship to be on the high road to a recognition in England , and he was persuaded to drink and exhibit proofs : which were that he had the constitution of the Family , as aforesaid , in every particular ; that he was peculiarly marked with testificatory spots ; and that his mere aspect inspired all members and branch members of the Family with awe and stupefaction . One of the latter hearing of him , had appointed to meet him in a pastrycook 's shop . He met him , and left the place with a cloud on his brow , showing tokens of respectful sympathy . Conceive a monomaniacal obese old English citizen , given to lift hand and eye and address the cornices , claiming to be an Illustrious Boy , and calling on a beautiful historic mother and unfortunate Royal sire to attest it ! No wonder the table was shaken with laughter . He appealed to Tenby constantly , as to the one man he knew in the room . Tenby it was who made the discovery of him somewhere in the City , where he earned his livelihood either as a corn - merchant ; or a stockbroker , or a chronometer - maker , or a drysalter , and was always willing to gratify a customer with the sight of his proofs of identity . Mr. Tenby made it his business to push his clamorous waggishness for the exhibition . I could readily believe that my father was more than his match in disposable sallies and weight of humour , and that he shielded the old creature successfully , so long as he had a tractable being to protect . But the Dauphin was plied with wine , and the marquis had his fun . Proof upon proof in verification of his claims was proffered by the now - tremulous son of St. Louis so he called himself . With , Jorian admitted , a real courtly dignity , he stood up and proposed to lead the way to any neighbouring cabinet to show the spots on his person ; living witnesses to the truth of his allegations , he declared them to be . The squire had authority for his broad farce , except in so far as he mixed up my father in the swinery of it . I grew more and more convinced that my father never could have lost his presence of mind when he found himself in the net of a plot to cover him with ridicule . He was the only one who did not retire to the Dauphin 's '
187436	187972	186949	186951	my Beautiful Mother	5992	' to return convulsed with vinous laughter after gravely inspecting the evidence ; for which abstention the Dauphin reproached him violently , in round terms of abuse , challengeing him to go through a similar process . This was the signal for Edbury , Tenby , and some of the rest . They formed a circle , one - half for the Dauphin , one for Roy . How long the boorish fun lasted , and what exactly came of it , I did not hear . Jorian DeWitt said my father lost his temper , a point contested by Wedderburn and Jennings , for it was unknown of him . Anyhow , he thundered to some effect , inasmuch as he detached those that had gentlemanly feelings from the wanton roysterers , and next day the latter pleaded wine . But they told the story , not without embellishments . The world followed their example . I dined and slept at Temple 's house , not caring to meet my incarnate humiliation . I sent to hear that he was safe . A quiet evening with a scholarly man , and a man of strong practical ability and shrewdness , like Mr. Temple , did me good . I wished my father and I were on the same footing as he and his son , and I may add his daughters . They all talked sensibly ; they were at feud with nobody ; they reflected their condition . It was a simple orderly English household , of which the father was the pillar , the girls the ornaments , the son the hope , growing to take his father 's place . My envy of such a home was acute , and I thought of Janet , and how well she was fashioned to build one resembling it , if only the mate allotted to her should not be a fantastical dreamer . Temple 's character seemed to me to demand a wife like Janet on its merits ; an idea that depressed me exceedingly . I had introduced Temple to Anna Penrhys , who was very kind to him ; but these two were not framed to be other than friends . Janet , on the contrary , might some day perceive the sterling fellow Temple was , notwithstanding his moderate height . She might , I thought . I remembered that I had once wished that she would , and I was amazed at myself . But why ? She was a girl sure to marry . I brushed these meditations away . They recurred all the time I was in Temple 's house . Mr. Temple waited for my invitation to touch on my father 's Case , when he distinctly pronounced his opinion that it could end but in failure . Though a strict Constitutionalist , he had words of disgust for princes , acknowledging , however , that we were not practical in our use of them , and kept them for political purposes often to the perversion of our social laws and their natural dispositions . He spoke of his son 's freak in joining the Navy . '

188132	188575	188124	188130	those who do n't wear the robe	6001	' Temple rejoined . His father advised me to read for the Bar , as a piece of very good training . I appealed to Temple , whether he thought it possible to read law - books in a cockboat in a gale of wind . Temple grimaced and his father nodded . Still it struck me that I might one day have the felicity of quiet hours to sit down with Temple and read Law far behind him in the race . And he envied me , in his friendly manner , I knew . My ambition had been blown to tatters . A new day dawned . The household rose and met at the breakfast - table , devoid of any dread of the morning newspapers . Their talk was like the chirrup of birds . Temple and his father walked away together to chambers , bent upon actual business upon doing something ! I reflected emphatically , and compared them to ships with rudders , while I was at the mercy of wind , tide , and wave . I called at Dettermain and Newson 's , and heard there of a discovery of a witness essential to the case , either in North Wales or in New South . I did not , as I had intended , put a veto on their proceedings . The thing to do was to see my father , and cut the case at the fountain head . For this purpose , it was imperative that I should go to him , and prepare myself for the interview by looking at the newspapers first . I bought one , hastily running my eyes down the columns in the shop . His name was printed , but merely in a fashionable notification that carriages took up and set down for his costume Ball , according to certain regulations . The relief of comparative obscurity helped me to breathe freely : not to be laughed at , was a gain . I was rather inclined to laud his courage in entering assembly - rooms , where he must be aware that he would see the Dauphin on every face . Perhaps he was guilty of some new extravagance last night , too late for scandal to reinforce the reporters !

Are you really prepared to imitate in him , with less excuse for doing it , the things you most condemn ? Let it be checked at the outset . It can not be .

196553	196854	196855	196855	You	6244	' to be at least postponed . The letter revealed what I had often conceived might be . My rejoinder to my aunt Dorothy laid stress on my father 's pledge of his word of honour as a gentleman to satisfy the squire on a stated day . I shrank from the idea of the Riversley crow over him . As to the lady , I said we would see that her money was fastened to her securely before she committed herself to the deeps . The money to be advanced to me would lie at my bankers , in my name , untouched : it would be repaid in the bulk after a season . This I dwelt on particularly , both to satisfy her and to appease my sense of the obligation . An airy pleasantry in the tone of this epistle amused me while writing it and vexed me when it had gone . But a letter sent , upon special request , by railway , should not , I thought , be couched in the ordinary strain . Besides one could not write seriously of a person like Lady Sampleman . I consulted my aunt Dorothy 's scruples by stopping my father on his way to the lady . His carriage was at the door : I suggested money - lenders : he had tried them all . He begged me to permit him to start : but it was too ignominious to think of its being done under my very eyes , and I refused . He had tried the money - lenders yesterday . They required a mortgage solider than expectations for the sum we wanted . Dettermain and Newson had declined to undertake the hypothecation of his annuity . Providence pointed to Sampleman . '
196865	196869	196855	196855	You	6244	' said he . '

197114	197696	197703	197704	a man	822	' His fertile ingenuity spared mine the task of persuading him to postpone the drive to Lady Sampleman . But that he would have been prompt to go , at a word from me , and was actually about to go when I entered his house , I could not question . He drove in manifest relief of mind to Dettermain and Newson 's . I had an appointment with Mr. Temple at a great political Club , to meet the gentlemen who were good enough to undertake the introduction of the infant member to the House of Commons . My incessantly twisting circumstances foiled the pleasure and pride due to me . From the Club I bent my steps to Temple 's district , and met in the street young Eckart vom Hof , my champion and second on a memorable occasion , fresh upon London , and looking very Germanic in this drab forest of our city people . He could hardly speak of Deutschland for enthusiasm at the sight of the moving masses . His object in coming to England , he assured me honestly , was to study certain editions of Tibullus in the British Museum . When he deigned to speak of Sarkeld , it was to say that Prince Hermann was frequently there . I gave him no chance to be sly , though he pushed for it , at a question of the Princess Ottilia 's health . The funeral pace of the block of cabs and omnibuses engrossed his attention . Suddenly the Englishman afforded him an example of the reserve of impetuosity we may contain . I had seen my aunt Dorothy in a middle line of cabs coming from the City , and was darting in a twinkling among wheels and shafts and nodding cab - horse noses to take her hand and know the meaning of her presence in London . She had family business to do : she said no more . I mentioned that I had checked my father for a day or two . She appeared grateful . Her anxiety was extreme that she might not miss the return train , so I relinquished her hand , commanded the cabman to hasten , and turned to rescue Eckart too young and faithful a collegian not to follow his friend , though it were into the lion 's den - from a terrific entanglement of horseflesh and vehicles brawled over by a splendid collision of tongues . Secure on the pavement again , Eckart humbly acknowledged that the English tongue could come out upon occasions . I did my best to amuse him . Whether it amused him to see me take my seat in the House of Commons , and hear a debate in a foreign language , I can not say ; but the only pleasure of which I was conscious at that period lay in the thought that he or his father , Baron vom Hof , might some day relate the circumstance at Prince Ernest 's table , and fix in Ottilia 's mind the recognition of my having tried to perform my part of the contract . Beggared myself , and knowing Prince Hermann to be in Sarkeld , all I hoped for was to show her I had followed the path she traced . My state was lower : besides misfortune I now found myself exalted only to feel my profound insignificance . '
197711	197768	197703	197704	a man	822	' said Charles Etherell , my friendly introductor , by whom I was passingly , perhaps ironically , advised to preserve silence for two or three sessions .

198958	199073	198951	198952	Roy Richmond	609	' Two or three urgent men round a great gentleman were extracting his affable approbation of the admirable nature of the experiment of the Chassediane before dinner . I saw that Eckart was comfortably seated , and telling Jorian to provide for him in the matter of tobacco , I went to my room , confused beyond power of thought by the sensible command of fortune my father , fortune 's sport at times , seemed really to have . His statement of the circumstances bewildered me even more . He was in no hurry to explain them ; when we met next morning he waited for me to question him , and said , '

I will tell you , Richie : the old Marquis of Edbury once placed five thousand pounds to my account on a proviso that I should neglect , is the better word , my Case . I inherited from him at his death ; of course his demise cancelled the engagement . He had been the friend of personages implicated . He knew . I suspect he apprehended the unpleasant position of a witness . '

201141	201394	201395	201397	The little devil	6375	' he said , as we turned into the Durstan grounds . The girl was like a flag - staff on the upper line of heathland . Heriot was strolling , cigar in mouth , down one of the diminutive alleys of young fir in this upstart estate . He affected to be prepossessed by the case between me and Edbury , and would say nothing of his own affairs , save that he meant to try for service in one of the Continental armies ; he whose susceptible love for his country was almost a malady . But he had given himself to women it was Cissy this , Trichy that , and the wiles of a Florence , the spites of an Agatha , duperies , innocent - seemings , witcheries , reptile - tricks of the fairest of women , all through his conversation . He had so saturated himself with the resources , evasions , and desperate cruising of these light creatures of wind , tide , and tempest , that , like one who has been gazing on the whirligoround , he saw the whole of women running or only waiting for a suitable partner to run the giddy ring to perdition and an atoning pathos . I cut short one of Heriot 's narratives by telling him that this picking bones of the dish was not to my taste . He twitted me with turning parson . I spoke of Kiomi . Heriot flushed , muttering , '
201399	201742	201743	201743	I	0	' with his usual contemplative relish of devilry . We parted , feeling that severe tension of the old links keeping us together which indicates the lack of new ones : a point where simple affection must bear the strain of friendship if it can . Heriot had promised to walk half - way with me to Bulsted , in spite of Lady Maria 's childish fears of some attack on him . He was now satisfied with a good - bye at the hall - doors , and he talked ostentatiously of a method that he had to bring Edbury up to the mark . I knew that same loud decreeing talk to be a method on his own behalf of concealing his sensitive resentment at the tone I had adopted : Lady Maria 's carriage had gone to fetch her husband from a political dinner . My portmanteau advised me to wait for its return . Durstan and Riversley were at feud , however , owing to some powerful rude English used toward the proprietor of the former place by the squire ; so I thought it better to let one of the grooms shoulder my luggage , and follow him . The night was dark ; he chose the roadway , and I crossed the heath , meeting an exhilarating high wind that made my blood race : Egoism is not peculiar to any period of life ; it is only especially curious in a young man beginning to match himself against his elders , for in him it suffuses the imagination ; he is not merely selfishly sentient , or selfishly scheming : his very conceptions are selfish . I remember walking at my swiftest pace , blaming everybody I knew for insufficiency , for want of subordination to my interests , for poverty of nature , grossness , blindness to the fine lights shining in me ; I blamed the Fates for harassing me , circumstances for not surrounding me with friends worthy of me . The central '
201744	202044	202047	202047	him	6376	' resembled the sun of this universe , with the difference that it shrieked for nourishment , instead of dispensing it . My monstrous conceit of elevation will not suffer condensation into sentences . What I can testify to is , that for making you bless the legs you stand on , a knockdown blow is a specific . I had it before I knew that a hand was up . I should have fancied that I had run athwart a tree , but for the recollection , as I was reeling to the ground , of a hulk of a fellow suddenly fronting me , and he did not hesitate with his fist . I went over and over into a heathery hollow . The wind sang shrill through the furzes ; nothing was visible but black clumps , black cloud . Astonished though I was , and shaken , it flashed through me that this was not the attack of a highwayman . He calls upon you to stand and deliver : it is a foe that hits without warning . The blow took me on the forehead , and might have been worse . Not seeing the enemy , curiosity was almost as strong in me as anger ; but reflecting that I had injured no one I knew of , my nerves were quickly at the right pitch . Brushing some spikes of furze off my hands , I prepared for it . A cry rose . My impression seemed to be all backward , travelling up to me a moment or two behind time . I recognised a strange tongue in the cry , but too late that it was Romany to answer it . Instantly a voice was audible above the noisy wind : '
202049	202355	202047	202047	him	6376	' Then began some good and fair fighting . I got my footing on grass , and liked the work . The fellow facing me was unmistakably gipsy - build . I , too , had length of arm , and a disposition to use it by hitting straight out , with footing firm , instead of dodging and capering , which told in my favour , and is decidedly the best display of the noble art on a dark night . My dancer went over as neatly as I had preceded him ; and therewith I considered enough was done for vengeance . The thrill of a salmon on the gut is known to give a savage satisfaction to our original nature ; it is but an extension and attenuation of the hearty contentment springing from a thorough delivery of the fist upon the prominent features of an assailant that yields to it perforce . Even when you receive such perfect blows you are half satisfied . Feeling conqueror , my wrath was soothed ; I bent to have a look at my ruffian , and ask him what cause of complaint gipsies camping on Durstan could find against Riversley . A sharp stroke on the side of my neck sent me across his body . He bit viciously . In pain and desperation I flew at another of the tawny devils . They multiplied . I took to my heels ; but this was the vainest of stratagems , they beat me in nimbleness . Four of them were round me when I wheeled breathless to take my chance at fighting the odds . Fiery men have not much notion of chivalry : gipsies the least of all . They yelled disdain of my summons to them to come on one by one : '
202420	202734	202735	202735	You	6380	' reach so long as I was disengaged . I had perpetually to shift my front , thinking Oh , for a stick ! any stout bit of timber ! My fists ached , and a repetition of nasty dull knocks on back and neck , slogging thumps dealt by men getting to make sure of me , shattered my breathing . I cried out for a pause , offered to take a couple of them at a time : I challenged three - the fourth to bide . I was now the dancer : left , right , and roundabout I had to swing , half - stunned , half - strangled with gorge . Those terrible blows in the back did the mischief . Sickness threatened to undermine me . Boxers have breathing - time : I had none . Stiff and sick , I tried to run ; I tottered , I stood to be knocked down , I dropped like a log - careless of life . But I smelt earth keenly , and the damp grass and the devil 's play of their feet on my chin , chest , and thighs , revived a fit of wrath enough to set me staggering on my legs again . They permitted it , for the purpose of battering me further . I passed from down to up mechanically , and enjoyed the chestful of air given me in the interval of rising : thought of Germany and my father , and Janet at her window , complacently ; raised a child 's voice in my throat for mercy , quite inaudible , and accepted my punishment . One idea I had was , that I could not possibly fail as a speaker after this I wanted but a minute 's grace to fetch breath for an oration , beginning , '
202738	202803	202735	202735	You	6380	' for I guessed that they had fallen upon the wrong man . Not a second was allowed . Soon the shrewd physical bracing , acting momentarily on my brain , relaxed ; the fitful illumination ceased : all ideas faded out - clung about my beaten body - fled . The body might have been tossed into its grave , for aught I knew .

203860	203865	203857	203857	I	0	' said the girl ; '

204040	204066	204033	204034	OUR men	2643	' the old woman ejaculated . There was innocence indeed ! sufficient to pass the whole tribe before a bench of magistrates . She wheedled : '
204098	204374	204375	204375	Richmond	244	' My despot Kiomi fired invectives at her mother . The old mother retorted ; the girl joined in . All three were scowling , flashing , showing teeth , driving the wordy javelin upon one another , indiscriminately , or two to one , without a pause ; all to a sound like the slack silver string of the fiddle . I sang out truce to them ; they racked me with laughter ; and such laughter ! the shaking of husks in a half - empty sack . Ultimately , on a sudden cessation of the storm of tongues , they agreed that I must have my broth . Sheer weariness , seasoned with some hope that the broth would give me strength to mount on my legs and walk , persuaded me to drink it . Still the old mother declared that none of her men would ever have laid hands on me . Why should they ? she asked . What had I done to them ? Was it their way ? Kiomi 's arms tightened over my breast . The involuntary pressure was like an illumination to me . No longer asking for the grounds of the attack on a mistaken person , and bowing to the fiction that none of the tribe had been among my assailants , I obtained information . The girl Eveleen had spied me entering Durstan . Quite by chance , she was concealed near Bulsted Park gates when the groom arrived and told the lodge - keeper that Mr. Harry Richmond was coming up over the heath , and might have lost his way . '
204377	204769	204375	204375	Richmond	244	' the girl threw a world of meaning into the unexpected name . Kiomi clutched me to her bosom , but no one breathed the name we had in our thoughts . Eveleen and the old mother had searched for me upon the heath , and having haled me head and foot to their tent , despatched a message to bring Kiomi down from London to aid them in their desperate shift . They knew Squire Beltham 's temper . He would have scattered the tribe to the shores of the kingdom at a rumour of foul play to his grandson . Kiomi came in time to smuggle me through an inspection of the tent and cross - examination of its ostensible denizens by Captain Bulsted , who had no suspicions , though he was in a state of wonderment . Hearing all this , I was the first to say it would be better I should get out of the neighbourhood as soon as my legs should support me . The grin that goes for a laugh among gipsies followed my question of how Kiomi had managed to smuggle me . Eveleen was my informant when the dreaded Kiomi happened to be off duty for a minute . By a hasty transformation , due to a nightcap on the bandages about the head , and an old petticoat over my feet , Captain William 's insensible friend was introduced to him as the sore sick great - grandmother of the tribe , mother of Kiomi 's mother , aged ninety - one . The captain paid like a man for doctor and burial fees ; he undertook also to send the old lady a pound of snuff to assist her to a last sneeze or two on the right side of the grave , and he kept his word ; for , deeming it necessary to paint her in a characteristic , these prodigious serpents told him gravely that she delighted in snuff ; it was almost the only thing that kept her alive , barring a sip of broth . Captain William 's comment on the interesting piece of longevity whose well - covered length and framework lay exposed to his respectful contemplation , was , that she must have been a devilish fine old lady in her day . '
204772	204835	204848	204848	he	6422	' was given as her measurement . One pound of snuff , a bottle of rum , and five sovereigns were the fruits of the captain 's sensibility . I shattered my ribs with laughter over the story . Eveleen dwelt on the triumph , twinkling . Kiomi despised laughter or triumph resulting from the natural exercise of craft in an emergency . '

205417	205446	205409	205409	you	0	' Kiomi said , with supernatural swiftness of deduction on her return . She added for my comfort that nothing was broken , but confessed me to be still '
205449	205679	205680	205680	Kiomi	351	' ; and thereupon drove knotty language at Eveleen . The girl retorted , and though these two would never acknowledge to me that any of their men had been in this neighbourhood recently , the fact was treated as a matter of course in their spiteful altercation , and each saddled the other with the mistake they had committed . Eveleen snatched the last word . What she said I did not comprehend , she must have hit hard . Kiomi 's eyes lightened , and her lips twitched ; she coloured like the roofing smoke of the tent fire ; twice she showed her teeth , as in a spasm , struck to the heart , unable to speak , breathing in and out of a bitterly disjoined mouth . Eveleen ran . I guessed at the ill - word spoken . Kiomi sat eyeing the wood - ashes , a devouring gaze that shot straight and read but one thing . They who have seen wild creatures die will have her before them , saving the fiery eyes . She became an ashen - colour , I took her little hand . Unconscious of me , her brown fingers clutching at mine , she flung up her nostrils , craving air . This was the picture of the woman who could not weep in her misery . '
205685	205845	205846	205846	I	0	' I called to her . I could have cursed that other friend , the son of mischief ; for she , I could have sworn , had been fiercely and wantonly hunted . Chastity of nature , intense personal pride , were as proper to her as the free winds are to the heaths : they were as visible to dull divination as the milky blue about the iris of her eyeballs . She had actually no animal vileness , animal though she might be termed , and would have appeared if compared with Heriot 's admirable Cissies and Gwennies , and other ladies of the Graces that run to fall , and spend their pains more in kindling the scent of the huntsman than in effectively flying . There was no consolation for her . The girl Eveleen came in sight , loitering and looking , kicking her idle heels . Kiomi turned sharp round to me . '
205847	205885	205846	205846	I	0	'm going . Your father 's here , up at Bulsted . I 'll see him . He wo n't tell . He 'll come soon . You 'll be fit to walk in a day . You 're
205901	205939	205892	205892	I	0	' she answered my attempt to keep her , and passed into the tent , out of which she brought a small bundle tied in a yellow handkerchief , and walked away , without nodding or speaking . '
205948	205966	205967	205967	I	0	' I questioned Eveleen , who was quickly beside me . She replied , accurately or not : '
205987	206000	205967	205967	I	0	' Therewith she pouted ; or , to sketch her with precision , '
206002	206168	206170	206171	your men	3855	' would better convey the vivacity of her ugly flash of features . It was an error in me to think her heartless . She talked of her aunt Kiomi affectionately , for a gipsy girl , whose modulated tones are all addressed to the soft public . Eveleen spoke with the pride of bated breath of the ferocious unforgivingness of their men . Perhaps if she had known that I traced the good repute of the tribes for purity to the sweeter instincts of the women , she would have eulogized her sex to amuse me . Gipsy girls , like other people , are fond of showing off ; but it would have been a victory of education to have helped her to feel the distinction of the feminine sense of shame half as awfully and warmly as she did the inscrutable iron despotism of the males . She hinted that the mistake of which I had been the victim would be rectified . '
206185	206214	206180	206180	I	0	' said I. While we were conversing my father arrived . Eveleen , not knowing him , would have had me accept the friendly covering of a mat . '
206226	206330	206221	206221	he	6444	' she muttered to herself , and ran to him and set up a gipsy whine , fronting me up to the last step while she advanced ; she only yielded ground to my outcry . My father bent over me . Kiomi had prepared him for what he saw . I quieted his alarm by talking currently and easily . Julia Bulsted had despatched a messenger to inform him of my mysterious disappearance ; but he , as his way was , revelling in large conjectures , had half imagined me seized by a gust of passion , and bound for Germany . '
206335	206339	206221	206221	he	6444	' I laughed . '
206348	206370	206346	206346	Richie	448	' he answered seriously . His conceit of a better knowledge of me than others possessed , had buoyed him up . '
206375	206379	206380	206380	we	6446	' he said , '
206403	206473	206474	206475	These people	2848	' he looked at me , and this look of dismay was a perfect mirror . I was not a presentable object . He stretched his limbs on the heather and kept hold of my hand , looking and talking watchfully , doctor - like , doubting me to be as sound in body as I assured him I was , despite aches and pains . Eveleen hung near . '

206616	206631	206633	206633	they	6453	' Eveleen cried , and finding herself in the wrong track , volubly resumed : '
206660	206678	206657	206657	they	6453	' The mystery of my not having sent word to Bulsted or to Riversley perplexed my father . '
206682	206711	206657	206657	they	6453	' he echoed me , disconsolately , and glanced at the heath , the tent , the black circle of the broth - pot , and the wild girl .

207056	207069	207038	207039	my father	925	' Clasping the lifeless body of my sole son , Harry Richmond , '
207361	207378	207346	207346	his	925	' Oh , Richie , Richie , if only I had my boy up and well ! '
207763	208354	208358	208358	his	925	' That was the origin of the notion , Richie . I carried it on . I dined some of the best men of our day . I seized the opportunity when our choicest " emperor " was rolling on wheels to propound my system . I mention the names of Bramham DeWitt , Colonel Hibbert Segrave , Lord Alonzo Carr , Admiral Loftus , the Earl of Luton , the Marquis of Hatchford , Jack Hippony , Monterez Williams , I think you know him ? and little Dick Phillimore , son of a big - wig , a fellow of a capital wit and discretion ; I mention them as present to convince you we are not triflers , dear boy . My argument ran , it is absurd to fight ; also it is intolerable to be compelled to submit to insult . As the case stands , we are under a summary edict of the citizens , to whom chivalry is unknown . Well , well , I delivered a short speech . Fighting , I said , resembled butting , a performance proper to creatures that grow horns instead of brains .. not to allude to a multitude of telling remarks ; and the question " Is man a fighting animal ? " my answer being that he is not born with spurs on his heels or horns to his head and that those who insisted on fighting should be examined by competent anatomists , " ologists " of some sort , to decide whether they have the excrescences , and proclaim them ... touching on these lighter parts of my theme with extreme delicacy . But and here I dwelt on my point : Man , if not a fighting animal in his glorious I forgot what is a sensitive one , and has the idea of honour . " Hear , " from Colonel Segrave , and Sir Weeton Slaterhe was one of the party . In fine , Richie , I found myself wafted into a breathing oration . I can not , I confess it humbly , hear your " hear , hear , " without going up and off , inflated like a balloon . " Shall the arbitration of the magistracy , indemnifications in money awarded by the Law - courts , succeed in satisfying , " but I declare to you , Richie , it was no platform speech . I know your term " the chaincable sentence . " Nothing of the kind , I assure you . Plain sense , as from gentlemen to gentlemen . We require , I said , a protection that the polite world of Great Britain does not now afford us against the aggressions of the knave , the fool , and the brute . We establish a Court . We do hereby no , no , not the " hereby " ; quite simply , Richie pledge ourselves I said some other word not " pledge " to use our utmost authority and influence to exclude from our circles persons refusing to make the reparation of an apology for wanton common insults : we renounce intercourse with men declining , when guilty of provoking the sentiment of hostility , to submit to the jurisdiction of our Court . All I want you to see is the notion . We raise the shield against the cowardly bully which the laws have raised against the bloody one . " And gentlemen , " '
208368	208496	208497	208497	He	6494	' " Gentlemen , we are the ultimate Court of Appeal for men who cherish their honour , yet abstain from fastening it like a millstone round the neck of their common - sense . " Credit me , Richie , the proposition kindled . We cited Lord Edbury to appear before us , and I tell you we extracted an ample apology to you from that young nobleman . And let me add , one that I , that we , must impose it upon an old son to accept . He does ! Come , come . And you shall see , Richie , society shall never repose an inert mass under my leadership . I cure it ; I shake it and cure it . '
208504	208516	208497	208497	He	6494	' I do not say I am possessed of a panacea , '
208526	208570	208571	208571	he	6494	' I maintain that I can and do fulfil the duties of my station , which is my element , attained in the teeth of considerable difficulties , as no other man could , be he prince or Prime Minister . Not one , '
208577	208586	208587	208587	he	6494	' And mind you , Richie , this , '
208609	208742	208587	208587	he	6494	' this is not self - glorification . I point you facts . I have a thousand schemes projects . I recognize the value of early misfortune . The particular misfortune of princes born is that they know nothing of the world babies ! I grant you , babies . Now , I do . I have it on my thumbnail . I know its wants . And just as I succeeded in making you a member of our Parliament in assembly , and the husband of an hereditary princess hear me so will I make good my original determination to be in myself the fountain of our social laws , and leader . I have never , I believe to speak conscientiously failed in a thing I have once determined on . '
208820	208842	208843	208843	He	8544	' You see me in my nakedness , Richie . To you and my valet , the heart , the body ! '

209057	209144	209055	209055	he	8544	' all young gentlemen were born Tories . The doctor no more expected to see a Radical come into the world from a good family than a radish . But I discern you , my dear boy . Our reigning Families must now be active ; they require the discipline I have undergone ; and I also dine at aldermen 's tables , and lay a foundation - stone as Jorian says with the facility of a hen - mother : that should not suffice them . '
209473	209546	209471	209471	Royalty	1232	' He launched on a series of desolate images . In the end , he at least persuaded himself that he had an idea in his anxiety to cultivate the primary British sentiment . We moved from town to town along the South coast ; but it was vain to hope we might be taken for simple people . Nor was he altogether to blame , except in allowing the national instinct for '
209550	209634	209635	209635	I	0	' to air itself unrebuked . I fled to the island . Temple ran down to meet me there , and I heard that Janet had written to him for news of me . He entered our hotel a private person ; when he passed out , hats flew off before him . The modest little fellow went along a double line of attentive observers on the pier , and came back , asking me in astonishment who he was supposed to be . '
209641	209677	209635	209635	I	0	' exclaimed my father . It accounted for the mystery . Temple knew my feelings , and did but glance at me . Close upon Temple 's arrival we had a strange couple of visitors . '
209685	209783	209678	209680	Mistress Dolly Disher	694	' my father introduced them . She called him by one of his Christian names inadvertently at times . The husband was a confectioner , a satisfied shade of a man who reserved the exercise of his will for his business , we learnt ; she , a bustling , fresh - faced woman of forty - five , with still expressive dark eyes , and , I guessed , the ideal remainder of a passion in her bosom . The guess was no great hazard . She was soon sitting beside me , telling me of the '
209785	209814	209969	209969	him	6515	' she had known my father , and of the most affectionate friend and perfect gentleman he was of the ladies who had been in love with him ; '
209817	209965	209967	209967	I	0	' : and of his sorrows and struggles , and his beautiful voice , and hearts that bled for him ; and of one at least who prayed and trusted he would be successful at last . Temple and the pallid confectioner spent the day on board a yacht with my father . Mrs. Dolly stayed to nurse me and persuade me to swallow medicine . She talked of her youth , when , as a fashionable bootmaker 's daughter , she permitted no bills to be sent in to Mr. Richmond , alleging , as a sufficient reason for it to her father , that their family came from Richmond in Yorkshire . Eventually , the bills were always paid . She had not been able to manage her husband so well ; and the consequence was , that she breathed low an execution was out ; '
209971	209976	209967	209967	I	0	' she said tremulously , '
210154	210157	210153	210153	I	0	'm ashamed . '
210268	210279	210280	210280	He	695	' I do not like to have my debts disturbed . '
210317	210585	210586	210586	He	6532	' You have struck a heavy blow to my credit , Richie . Good little Mistress Dolly brought the man down here no select addition to our society and we were doing our utmost to endure him , as the ladies say , for the very purpose ... but the error stands committed ! For the future , friend Disher will infallibly expect payments within the year . Credit for suppers is the guarantee of unlimited entertainments . And I was inspiring him with absolute confidence for next year 's campaign . Money , you are aware , is no longer a question to terrify me . I hold proofs that I have conclusively frightened Government , and you know it . But this regards the manipulation of the man Disher . He will now dictate to me . A refresher of a few hundreds would have been impolitic to this kind of man ; but the entire sum ! and to a creditor in arms ! You reverse the proper situations of gentleman and tradesman . My supperman , in particular , should be taught to understand that he is bound up in my success . Something frightened him ; he proceeded at law ; and now we have shown him that he has frightened us . An execution ? My dear boy , I have danced an execution five years running , and ordered , consecutively , at the same house . Like other matters , an execution depends upon how you treat it . The odds are that we have mortally offended Mistress Dolly . '
210614	210618	210586	210586	He	6532	' the sagacious General '
210680	211117	211118	211118	You	6536	' book . Bonds and bills were falling due : the current expenses were exhausting . I tried to face the evil , and take a line of conduct , staggering , as I did on my feet . Had I been well enough , I believe I should have gone to my grandfather , to throw myself on his good - nature ; such was the brain 's wise counsel : but I was all nerves and alarms , insomuch that I interdicted Temple 's writing to Janet , lest it should bring on me letters from my aunt Dorothy , full of advice that could no longer be followed , well - meant cautions that might as well be addressed to the mile - posts behind me . Moreover , Janet would be flying on the wind to me , and I had a craving for soft arms and the look of her eyebrows , that warned me to keep her off if I intended to act as became a man of good faith . Fair weather , sunny green sea - water speckled with yachts shooting and bounding , and sending me the sharp sense of life there is in dashed - up fountains of silvery salt - spray , would have quickened my blood sooner but for this hot - bed of fruitless adventure , tricksy precepts , and wisdom turned imp , in which my father had again planted me . To pity him seemed a childish affectation . His praise of my good looks pleased me , for on that point he was fitted to be a judge , and I was still fancying I had lost them on the heath . Troops of the satellites of his grand parade surrounded him . I saw him walk down the pier like one breaking up a levee . At times he appeared to me a commanding phantasm in the midst of phantasm figures of great ladies and their lords , whose names he told off on his return like a drover counting his herd ; but within range of his eye and voice the reality of him grew overpowering . It seduced me , and , despite reason , I began to feel warm under his compliments . He was like wine . Gaiety sprang under his feet . Sitting at my window , I thirsted to see him when he was out of sight , and had touches of the passion of my boyhood . I listened credulously , too , as in the old days , when he repeated , '
211135	211147	211130	211130	Richie	448	' His manner hinted that there was a surprise in store . '
211161	211572	211130	211130	Richie	448	' He resembled wine in the other conditions attached to its rare qualities . Oh for the choice of having only a little of him , instead of having him on my heart ! The unfilial wish attacked me frequently : he could be , and was , so ravishing to strangers and light acquaintances . Did by chance a likeness exist between us ? My sick fancy rushed to the Belthams for a denial . There did , of some sort , I knew ; and the thought partitioned my dreamy ideas , of which the noblest , taking advantage of my physical weakness , compelled me to confess that it was a vain delusion for one such as I to hope for Ottilia . This looking at the roots of yourself , if you are possessed of a nobler half that will do it , is a sound corrective of an excessive ambition . Unfortunately it would seem that young men can do it only in sickness . With the use of my legs , and open - air breathing , I became compact , and as hungry and zealous on behalf of my individuality , as proud of it as I had ever been : prouder and hungrier . My first day of outing , when , looking at every face , I could reflect on the miraculous issue of mine almost clear from its pummelling , and above all , that my nose was safe not stamped with the pugilist 's brand inspired a lyrical ebullition of gratitude . Who so intoxicated as the convalescent catching at health ? I met Charles Etherell on the pier , and heard that my Parliamentary seat was considered in peril , together with a deal of gossip about my disappearance . My father , who was growing markedly restless , on the watch for letters and new arrivals , started to pay Chippenden a flying visit . He begged me urgently to remain for another few days , while he gathered information , saying my presence at his chief quarters did him infinite service , and I always thought that possible . I should find he was a magician , he repeated , with a sort of hesitating fervour . I had just waved my hand to him as the boat was bearing him away from the pier - head , when a feminine voice murmured in my ear , '
211594	211607	211580	211582	Mr. Harry Richmond	244	' She ran on , allowing me time to recognize Clara Goodwin . '
211627	211634	211130	211130	Richie	448	' I made light of it . '

The bitter creature drew me at her heels into a linendraper 's shop . There she took a seat , pitched her voice to the key of a lady 's at a dinner - table , when speaking to her cavalier of the history or attire of some one present , and said , '

212288	212345	212083	212083	You	6539	' With the accent you give it , heaven only knows what it means . I would rather you did not talk here like a Frenchman relating his last love - affair in company . Must your voice escape control exactly at the indicatory words ?

The rumour was that you were very ill ; so I hired a furnished place for Frau von Dittmarsch at once .

213258	213987	213252	213252	You	244	' Miss Goodwin had promised to meet the foreign ladies on the pier . We quarrelled and made it up a dozen times like girl and boy , I calling her aunt Clara , as in the old days , and she calling me occasionally son Richie : an imitation of my father 's manner of speech to me when we formed acquaintance first in Venice . But I was very little aware of what I was saying or doing . The forces of my life were yoked to the heart , and tumbled as confusedly as the world under Phaethon charioteer . We walked on the heights above the town . I looked over the water to the white line of shore and batteries where this wonder stood , who was what poets dream of , deep - hearted men hope for , none quite believe in . Hardly could I ; and though my relenting spinster friend at my elbow kept assuring me it was true that she was there , my sceptical sight fixed on the stale prominences visible in the same features which they had worn day after empty day of late . This deed of hers was an act of devotion great as death . I knew it from experience consonant to Ottilia 's character ; but could a princess , hereditary , and bound in the league of governing princes , dare so to brave her condition ? Complex of mind , simplest in character , the uncontrollable nobility of her spirit was no sooner recognized by me than I was shocked throughout by a sudden light , contrasting me appallingly with this supreme of women , who swept the earth aside for truth . I had never before received a distinct intimation of my littleness of nature , and my first impulse was to fly from thought , and then , as if to prove myself justly accused , I caught myself regretting no , not regretting , gazing , as it were , on a picture of regrets that Ottilia was not a romantic little lady of semi - celestial rank , exquisitely rash , wilful , desperately enamoured , bearing as many flying hues and peeps of fancy as a love - ballad , and not more roughly brushing the root - emotions . If she had but been such an one , what sprightly colours , delicious sadness , magical transformations , tenderest intermixture of earth and heaven ; what tears and sunbeams , divinest pathos : what descents from radiance to consolatory twilight , would have surrounded me for poetry and pride to dwell on ! What captivating melody in the minor key would have been mine , though I lost her the legacy of it all for ever ! Say a petulant princess , a star of beauty , mad for me , and the whisper of our passion and sorrows traversing the flushed world ! Was she coming ? Not she , but a touchstone , a relentless mirror , a piercing eye , a mind severe as the Goddess of the God 's head : a princess indeed , but essentially a princess above women : a remorseless intellect , an actual soul visible in the flesh . She was truth . Was I true ? Not so very false , yet how far from truth ! The stains on me a modern man writing his history is fugitive and crepuscular in alluding to them , as a woman kneeling at the ear - guichet burnt like the blood - spots on the criminal compelled to touch his victim by savage ordinance , which knew the savage and how to search him . And these were faults of weakness rather than the sins of strength . I might as fairly hope for absolution of them from Ottilia as from offended laws of my natural being , gentle though she was , and charitable . Was I not guilty of letting her come on to me hoodwinked at this moment ? I had a faint memory of Miss Goodwin 's saying that she had been deceived , and I suggested a plan of holding aloof until she had warned the princess of my perfect recovery , to leave it at her option to see me . '
213990	213995	213252	213252	You	244	' Miss Goodwin assented : '
214002	214013	214000	214000	Harry	244	' Her compassion for me only tentatively encouraged the idea . '
214038	214188	214033	214033	You	6570	' She must have laughed at me in her heart . The hours wore on . My curse of introspection left me , and descending through the town to the pier , amid the breezy blue skirts and bonnet - strings , we watched the packet - boat approaching . There was in advance one of the famous swift island wherries . Something went wrong with it , for it was overtaken , and the steamer came in first . I jumped on board , much bawled at . Out of a crowd of unknown visages , Janet appeared : my aunt Dorothy was near her . The pair began chattering of my paleness , and wickedness in keeping my illness unknown to them . They had seen Temple on an excursion to London ; he had betrayed me , as he would have betrayed an archangel to Janet . '
214198	214214	214215	214215	Harry	244	' they both said . The passengers were quitting the boat , strangers every one . '
214225	214344	214215	214215	Harry	244	' said Janet . My aunt Dorothy took the blame on herself . I scarcely noticed them , beyond leading them on to the pier - steps and leaving them under charge of Miss Goodwin , who had , in matters of luggage and porterage , the practical mind and aplomb of an Englishwoman that has passed much of her time on the Continent . I fancied myself vilely duped by this lady . The boat was empty of its passengers ; a grumbling pier - man , wounded in his dignity , notified to me that there were fines for disregard of the Company 's rules and regulations . His tone altered ; he touched his hat : '
214355	214366	214215	214215	Harry	244	' Janet overheard him , and her face was humorous . '
214376	214382	214373	214373	you	6574	' I said to her . '
214395	214411	214385	214385	him	6577	' she replied ; so spontaneously did the circumstance turn her thoughts on my father . '
214418	214419	214413	214413	you	6574	' '
214422	214423	214424	214424	You	6574	' '

214445	214450	214451	214451	You	6574	' Miss Goodwin interposed : '

214471	214478	214460	214460	Grandada	572	' Janet prompted my aunt Dorothy . '
214494	214500	214488	214488	Uberly	381	' Dorothy murmured in distress . '
214518	214523	214488	214488	Uberly	381	' Miss Goodwin remarked . '
214547	214548	214551	214551	he	244	' '
214562	214570	214557	214557	he	244	' said Janet , smiling a little . '
214577	214591	214571	214571	They	6586	' said Miss Goodwin . Near us a couple of yachtsmen were conversing . '
214604	214608	214594	214594	he	244	' one said . '
214611	214697	214711	214712	the other	3425	' ve once tasted that old boy , you ca n't do without him . I remember when I was a youngster it was in Lady Betty Bolton 's day ; she married old Edbury , you know , first wife the Magnificent was then in his prime . He spent his money in a week : so he hired an eighty - ton schooner ; he laid violent hands on a Jew , bagged him , lugged him on board , and sailed away . '
214698	214709	214711	214712	the other	3425	' What the deuce did he want with a Jew ? '
214714	214725	214711	214712	the other	3425	' Oh , the Jew supplied cheques for a three months '
214752	214758	214735	214735	I	0	' The unconscious slaughterers laughed . '
214762	214786	214735	214735	I	0	' I heard it said by the first speaker , as they swung round to parade the pier , and passed on narrating . '
214799	214816	214735	214735	I	0	' my aunt Dorothy , with heightened colour , urged Miss Goodwin . They talked together . '
214825	214829	214823	214823	Harry	244	' Janet said . '
214867	214972	214974	214974	you	6597	'm afraid his health is worse than he thinks . Temple did not say your father was here , but grandada must have suspected it when he consented to our coming , and said he would follow us . So that looks well perhaps . He has been much quieter since your money was paid back to you . If they should meet ... no , I hope they will not : grandada hates noise . And , Harry , let me tell you : it may be nothing : if he questions you , do not take fire ; just answer plainly : I 'm
214985	215070	215071	215071	I	0	'm sure 's enough : you have only to be patient with him . He has been going to London , to the City , seeing lawyers , bankers , brokers , and coming back muttering . Ah ! dear old man . And when he ought to have peace ! Harry , the poor will regret him in a thousand places . I write a great deal for him now , and I know how they will . What are you looking at ? '
215107	215110	215111	215111	I	0	' Schwartz ! '
215138	215157	215133	215134	A lady	2024	' Dear Mr. Harry Richmond ! Then you are better ? We had most alarming news of you . '

215175	215180	215181	215183	Frau von Dittmarsch	699	' She is here . '
215249	215267	215268	215269	Dorothy Beltham	240	' They went over in a little boat , they were so impatient . Who is she ? '
215272	215277	215279	215279	Janet	356	' The Princess Ottilia , '
215281	215292	215293	215293	I	0	' Are you certain ? Is it really , Harry ? '
215302	215319	215293	215293	I	0	' I should have guessed it could be no other ; she has a foreign grace . '
215320	215335	215337	215337	Janet	356	' General Goodwin was with them when the boat came in from the island , '
215339	215403	215337	215337	Janet	356	' He walked up to Harry 's father , and you noticed , aunty , that the ladies stood away , as if they wished to be unobserved , as we did , and pulled down their veils . They would not wait for our boat . We passed them crossing . People joked about the big servant over - weighing the wherry . '
215415	215423	215424	215424	I	0	' She knows what a sea is , '

216437	216447	216434	216434	She	432	' You have not wasted your time in England . '
216500	216519	216497	216497	She	432	' I have offended my father ; I have written to him ; he will take me away . '
216661	216706	216658	216658	She	432	' You knew nothing of it . A little transgression is the real offender . When we are once out of the way traced for us , we are in danger of offending at every step ; we are as lawless as the outcasts . '
216710	216722	216658	216658	She	432	' My turning aside to you originally was the blameable thing . '
216727	216744	216745	216745	She	432	' My love of you sets my ideas of duty at variance with my father 's . '
216871	216883	216868	216868	She	432	' It is as young as when we met in the forest '
216971	216982	216968	216968	she	432	' Would hearing of your recovery have given me peace ? '

They were talking spiritedly : what was wonderful , they gave not much heed to me : they seemed on edge for one another 's conversation : each face was turned to the other 's , and after nodding an adieu , they resumed the animated discourse . I had been rather in alarm lest Ottilia should think little of Janet . They passed out of sight without recurring to a thought of me behind them . In the evening I was one among a group of ladies . I had the opportunity of hearing the running interchange between Ottilia and Janet , which appeared to be upon equal terms ; indeed , Janet led . The subjects were not very deep . Plain wits , candour , and an unpretending tongue , it seemed , could make common subjects attractive , as fair weather does our English woods and fields . The princess was attracted by something in Janet . I myself felt the sway of something , while observing Ottilia 's rapt pleasure in her talk and her laughter , with those funny familiar frowns and current dimples twisting and melting away like a play of shadows on the eddies of the brook .

217390	217398	217399	217399	Janet	356	' m glad to be with her , '

217512	217523	217524	217524	Janet	356	' That 's manly ; that 's nice of you , '
217558	217804	217550	217550	Janet	356	' Keep him away , bring down grandada , Harry . She can not quit the island , because she has given Prince Ernest immediate rendezvous here . You must not delay to go . Yes , the Countess of Delzenburg shall have your excuses . And no , I promise you I will run nobody down . Besides , if I do , aunty will be at hand to plead for the defence , and she can ! She has a way that binds one to accept everything she says , and Temple ought to study with her for a year or two before he wears his gown . Bring him back with you and grandada . He is esteemed here at his true worth . I love him for making her in love with English boys . I leave the men for those who know them , but English boys are unrivalled , I declare . Honesty , bravery , modesty , and nice looks ! They are so nice in their style and their way of talking . I tell her , our men may be shy and sneering , awkward , I daresay ; but our boys beat the world . Do bring down Temple . I should so like her to see a cricket - match between two good elevens of our boys , Harry , while she is in England ! We could have arranged for one at Riversley . '

222333	222342	222330	222330	your	244	' I was in the mood to ask , '
222349	222389	222330	222330	your	244	' She had , however , a glow and a ringing articulation in her excitement that forbade trifling ; a minute 's reflection set me weighing my power of will against my father 's . I nodded to her . '
222399	222583	222330	222330	your	244	' she called . I have said that I weighed my power of will against my father 's . Contemplation of the state of the scales did not send me striding to meet him . Let it be remembered I had it strongly in memory that he habitually deluded himself under the supposition that the turn of all events having an aspect of good fortune had been planned by him of old , and were offered to him as the legitimately - won fruits of a politic life . While others deemed him mad , or merely reckless , wild , a creature living for the day , he enjoyed the conceit of being a profound schemer , in which he was fortified by a really extraordinary adroitness to take advantage of occurrences : and because he was prompt in an emergency , and quick to profit of a crisis , he was deluded to imagine that he had created it . Such a man would be with difficulty brought to surrender his prize . Again , there was his love for me . '
222592	222760	222761	222762	the man	7974	' How was this vast conceit of a not unreal paternal love to be encountered ? The sense of honour and of decency might appeal to him personally ; would either of them get a hearing if he fancied them to be standing in opposition to my dearest interests ? I , unhappily , as the case would be sure to present itself to him , appeared the living example of his eminently politic career . After establishing me the heir of one of the wealthiest of English commoners , would he be likely to forego any desperate chance of ennobling me by the brilliant marriage ? His dreadful devotion to me extinguished the hope that he would , unless I should happen to be particularly masterful in dealing with him . I heard his nimble and overwhelming volubility like a flood advancing . That could be withstood , and his arguments and persuasions . But by what steps could I restrain the man himself ? I said '
222764	222971	222761	222762	the man	7974	' as Janet did . He figured in my apprehensive imagination as an engine more than as an individual . Lassitude oppressed me . I felt that I required every access of strength possible , physical besides moral , in anticipation of our encounter , and took a swim in sea - water , which displaced my drowsy fit , and some alarming intimations of cowardice menacing a paralysis of the will : I had not altogether recovered from my gipsy drubbing . And now I wanted to have the contest over instantly . It seemed presumable that my father had slept at my lodgings . There , however , the report of him was , that he had inspected the rooms , highly complimented the owner of them , and vanished . Returning to the pier , I learnt that he had set sail in his hired yacht for the sister town on the Solent , at an early hour : for what purpose ? I knew of it too late to intercept it . One of the squire 's horses trotted me over ; I came upon Colonel Hibbert Segrave near the Club - house , and heard that my father was off again : '
222993	223120	223121	223122	The prince	2912	' said he , and cordially asked to have the date of the marriage . My face astonished him . He excused himself for speaking of this happy event so abruptly . A sting of downright anger drove me back at a rapid canter . It flashed on me that this Prince Ernest , whose suave fashion of depressing me , and philosophical skill in managing his daughter , had induced me to regard him as a pattern of astuteness , was really both credulous and feeble , or else supremely unsuspecting : and I was confirmed in the latter idea on hearing that he had sailed to visit the opposite harbour and docks on board my father 's yacht . Janet shared my secret opinion . '
223127	223147	223124	223125	a gentleman	7983	' she said . Her wrath and disgust were unspeakable . My aunt Dorothy blamed her for overdue severity . '

Do n't you understand , aunty , that the intrigue , plot I do n't choose to be nice upon terms may be perfectly successful , and do good to nobody . The prince may be tricked ; the princess , I am sure , will not . '
223468	223479	223451	223451	I	0	' He does not come within her scope , Harry . '

223675	223724	223666	223666	others	1560	' shops , eager for gossip , as the languid stretch of indolence inclines men to be . The Admiral asked me for the whereabout of Prince Ernest 's territory . He too said that the prince would be free of the Club during his residence , adding : '
223729	223821	223666	223666	others	1560	' not a question demanding an answer . The men might have let the princess go by , but there would have been questions urgently demanding answers had she been seen by their women . Late in the evening my father 's yacht was sighted from the pier . Just as he reached his moorings , and his boat was hauled round , the last steamer came in . Sharp - eyed Janet saw the squire on board among a crowd , and Temple next to him , supporting his arm . '
223827	223926	223666	223666	others	1560	' she exclaimed . My chief concern was to see my father 's head rising in the midst of the crowd , uncovering repeatedly . Prince Ernest and General Goodwin were behind him , stepping off the lower pier - platform . The General did not look pleased . My grandfather , with Janet holding his arm , in the place of Temple , stood waiting to see that his man had done his duty by the luggage . My father , advancing , perceived me , and almost taking the squire into his affectionate salutation , said : '
223939	223944	223936	223937	Mr. Beltham	245	' The squire rejoined : '
223959	223960	223951	223952	Mr. Richmond	244	' '
223973	224001	223967	223967	sir	7975	' Janet went up to General Goodwin . My father talked to me , and lost a moment in shaking Temple 's hand and saying kind things . '
224011	224015	224008	224009	Mr. Beltham	245	' he resumed ; '
224040	224142	224143	224143	Harry	245	' He turned . General Goodwin was hurrying the prince up the steps , the squire at the same time retreating hastily . I witnessed the spectacle of both parties to the projected introduction swinging round to make their escape . My father glanced to right and left . He covered in the airiest fashion what would have been confusion to another by carrying on a jocose remark that he had left half spoken to Temple , and involved Janet in it , and soon through sheer amiable volubility and his taking manner the squire himself for a minute or so . '
224155	224160	224145	224145	I	0	' Janet whispered rapidly . '
224182	224427	224173	224173	She	6861	' Janet named a famous admiral , kindling as a fiery beacon to our blood . She would have said more : she looked the remainder ; but she could have said nothing better fitted to spur me to the work she wanted done . Mournfulness dropped on me like a cloud in thinking of the bright little princess of my boyhood , and the Ottilia of to - day , faithful to her early passion for our sea - heroes and my country , though it had grievously entrapped her . And into what hands ! Not into hands which could cast one ray of honour on a devoted head . The contrast between the sane service giving men she admired , and the hopping skipping social meteor , weaver of webs , thrower of nets , who offered her his history for a nuptial acquisition , was ghastly , most discomforting . He seemed to have entangled us all . He said that he had . He treated me now confessedly as a cipher . The prince , the princess , my grandfather , and me he had gathered us together , he said . I heard from him that the prince , assisted by him in the part of an adviser , saw no way of cutting the knot but by a marriage . All were at hand for a settlement of the terms : Providence and destiny were dragged in . '
224435	224439	224442	224442	Richie	448	' I interposed . '
224448	224493	224442	224442	Richie	448	' he assented . This was on the pier , while he bowed and greeted passing figures . I dared not unlink my arm , for fear of further mischief . I got him to my rooms , and insisted on his dining there . '
224499	224544	224545	224546	The prince	2912	' he said . My anticipations of the nature of our wrestle were correct . But I had not expected him to venture on the assertion that the prince was for the marriage . He met me at every turn with this downright iteration . '

No matter : I keep my oath . Abandon it ? pooh ! you are forgive me silly . Pardon me for remarking it , you have not that dashing courage never mind . The point is , I have my prince in his trap . We are perfectly polite , but I have him , and he acknowledges it ; he shrugs : love has beaten him . Very well . And observe : I permit no squire - of - low - degree insinuations ; none of that . The lady all earthly blessings on her ! does not stoop to Harry Richmond . I have the announcement in the newspapers .

We were in the midst of a debate as to his right of personal freedom , upon the singularity of which he commented with sundry ejaculations , when Temple arrived and General Goodwin sent up his card . Temple and I left the general closeted with my father , and stood at the street - door . He had seen the princess , having at her request been taken to present his respects to her by Janet . How she looked , what she said , he was dull in describing ; he thought her lively , though she was pale . She had mentioned my name , '
225694	225831	225562	225562	I	0	' he observed . And he knew , or suspected , the General to be an emissary from the prince . But he could not understand the exact nature of the complication , and plagued me with a mixture of blunt inquiries and the delicate reserve proper to him so much that I had to look elsewhere for counsel and sympathy . Janet had told him everything ; still he was plunged in wonder , tempting me to think the lawyer 's mind of necessity bourgeois , for the value of a sentiment seemed to have no weight in his estimation of the case . Nor did he appear disinclined to excuse my father . Some of his remarks partly swayed me , in spite of my seeing that they were based on the supposition of an '
225835	225900	225901	225901	Clara	294	' adventure of a mad princess . They whispered a little hope , when I was adoring her passionately for being the reverse of whatever might have given hope a breath . General Goodwin , followed by my father , came down and led me aside after I had warned Temple not to let my father elude him . The General was greatly ruffled . '
225910	225914	225901	225901	Clara	294	' he said . '

226316	226388	226309	226309	I	0	' I said , unsatisfactorily to myself and to him , for he transposed our situations , telling me the things he would say and do in my place ; things not dissimilar to those I had already said and done , only more toweringly enunciated ; and for that reason they struck me as all the more hopelessly ineffectual , and made me despair . My dumbness excited his ire . '

226463	226494	226458	226458	I	0	' His way of speaking of the princess opened an idea of the world 's , in the event of her name falling into its clutches . I said again , '
226502	226594	226495	226495	I	0	' and sang out for Temple . He was alone . My father had slipped from him to leave a card at the squire 's hotel . General Goodwin touched Temple on the shoulder kindly , in marked contrast to his treatment of me , and wished us good - night . Nothing had been heard of my father by Janet , but while I was sitting with her , at a late hour , his card was brought up , and a pencilled entreaty for an interview the next morning . '
226600	226604	226605	226605	He	572	' Janet said . '
226619	226662	226605	226605	He	572	' She related that the prince was in a state of undisguised distraction . From what I could comprehend it appeared incredible he regarded his daughter 's marriage as the solution of the difficulty , the sole way out of the meshes . '
226669	226681	226666	226666	her	6908	' said Temple ; perhaps with a wish of his own . '
226699	226742	226685	226685	you	6909	' said Janet . Her radiant perception of an ideal in her sex the first she ever had made her utterly contemptuous toward the less enlightened . We appointed the next morning at half - past eleven for my father 's visit . '

He slept at a room close to the hotel . A note from Clara Goodwin adjured me , by her memory of the sweet , brave , gracious fellow she loved in other days , to be worthy of what I had been . The General had unnerved her reliance on me . I sat up for my father until long past midnight . When he came his appearance reminded me of the time of his altercation with Baroness Turckems under the light of the blazing curtains : he had supped and drunk deeply , and he very soon proclaimed that I should find him invincible , which , as far as insensibility to the strongest appeals to him went , he was .

233048	233066	233069	233069	You	244	' Janet stared at her , and the squire threw his head back with an amazed interjection . '
233070	233083	233069	233069	You	244	're for it now ? Why , at breakfast you were all t '

233142	233170	233171	233171	Harry	244	' She spoke feverishly , with an unsweet expression of face , that seemed to me to indicate vexedness at the squire 's treatment of my father . '
233173	233183	233186	233186	your	244	' she asked me in a very earnest fashion , '
233228	233257	233258	233258	You	0	' Janet stooped to whisper in the squire 's ear . He caught the shock of unexpected intelligence apparently ; faced about , gazed up , and cried : '

233302	233307	233308	233308	I	0	' Janet laughed faintly . '

233375	233380	233381	233381	I	0	' My father nodded : '

233402	233406	233387	233387	grandada	572	' Janet said . '

233431	233445	233425	233425	I	0	' he said , crestfallen . Janet pressed my aunt Dorothy 's hand . '
233477	233615	233452	233452	you	701	' My aunt Dorothy accepted the eulogy with a singular trembling wrinkle of the forehead . She evidently understood that Janet had seen her wish to get released . For my part , I shared my grandfather 's stupefaction at their unaccountable changes . It appeared almost as if my father had won them over to baffle him . The old man tried to insist on their sitting down again , but Janet perseveringly smiled and smiled until he stood up . She spoke to him softly . He was one black frown ; displeased with her ; obedient , however . Too soon after , I had the key to the enigmatical scene . At the moment I was contemptuous of riddles , and heard with idle ears Janet 's promptings to him and his replies . '
233627	233650	233452	233452	you	701	' he said . She urged that it could not be settled here without the whole burden and responsibility falling upon him . '
233653	233683	233452	233452	you	701	' interposed my father , triumphing . Dorothy Beltham came to my side , and said , as if speaking to herself , while she gazed out of window , '
233695	233701	233692	233693	the prince	2912	' She dropped her voice : '
233732	233784	233723	233723	you	7127	' Now , that she should be possessed by the spirit of parsimony on my behalf at such a time as this , was to my conception insanely comical , and her manner of expressing it was too much for me . I kept my laughter under to hear her continue : '
233825	233826	233829	233829	you	7127	' '
233836	233844	233833	233834	Miss Beltham	371	' My father bowed to her gallantly . '
233861	233872	233851	233853	My private band	7129	' She was obliged to smile to excuse his interruption . '
233880	233892	233851	233853	My private band	7129	' said the squire , bursting out of Janet 's hand . '
233897	233920	233921	233921	I	0	' Janet had a difficulty in resuming her command of him . The mention of the private band made him very restive . '
233922	233939	233940	233940	he	0	' m not acting on my own judgement at all in going to these foreign people , '
233945	233968	233969	233969	He	0	' Why go ? I can have it out here and an end to it , without bothering them and their interpreters . '
233975	233993	233969	233969	He	0	' Harry , do you want me to go through this form for you ? mn'd unpleasant ! '
234002	234007	233996	233996	Dorothy	240	' Yes ! yes ! '
234008	234013	234014	234014	he	0	' I feel tricked ! '
234042	234048	234026	234026	he	0	' that sum of money . '

234102	234187	234094	234094	You	0	' said she . He vowed that he was being bewildered , bothered by us all ; and I thought I had never seen him so far below his level of energy ; but I had not seen him condescend to put himself upon a moderately fair footing with my father . The truth was , that Janet had rigorously schooled him to bridle his temper , and he was no match for the voluble easy man without the freest play of his tongue . '
234191	234196	234094	234094	You	0	' he kept ejaculating . '
234216	234260	234205	234205	you	9557	' Janet said . He begged her fretfully not to be impatient , and hinted that she and he might be acting the part of dupes , and was for pursuing his inauspicious cross - examination in spite of his blundering , and the '
234266	234317	234205	234205	you	9557	' which pulled him up . My father , either talking to my aunt Dorothy , to Janet , or to me , on ephemeral topics , scarcely noticed him , except when he was questioned , and looked secure of success in the highest degree consistent with perfect calmness . '
234330	234337	234328	234328	you	9557	' the squire called to me . '
234390	234409	234380	234380	he	7138	're all of us in a muddle about . I 'll do it if it 's right . You 're
234412	234459	234460	234461	Another prince	7140	' He glanced at Janet . She nodded . I was looking for this quaint and , to me , incomprehensible interlude to commence with the departure of the squire and Janet , when a card was handed in by one of the hotel - waiters . '
234463	234468	234460	234461	Another prince	7140	' cried the squire . '
234506	234507	234502	234502	he	7140	' '
234526	234531	234524	234524	Harry	244	' Janet asked me . '
234539	234704	234524	234524	Harry	244	' said I , losing my inattention all at once with a mad leap of the heart . Hermann 's presence gave light , fire , and colour to the scene in which my destiny had been wavering from hand to hand without much more than amusedly interesting me , for I was sure that I had lost Ottilia ; I knew that too well , and worse could not happen . I had besides lost other things that used to sustain me , and being reckless , I was contemptuous , and listened to the talk about money with sublime indifference to the subject : with an attitude , too , I daresay . But Hermann 's name revived my torment . Why had he come ? to persuade the squire to control my father ? Nothing but that would suffer itself to be suggested , though conjectures lying in shadow underneath pressed ominously on my mind . My father had no doubts . '
234782	234811	234779	234780	Prince Ernest	425	' The squire threw a hasty glare of his eyes back as he was hobbling on Janet 's arm . She stopped short , and replied for him . '
234841	234842	234836	234836	We	7147	' '
234847	234854	234836	234836	We	7147	' said my father , graciously . '
235098	235109	235095	235095	I	0	' he lured her with the dimple of a lurking smile '
235212	235218	235210	235211	a judge	10013	' he bowed to her deferentially '
235292	235498	235256	235256	her	2937	' The squire could endure no more , and happily so , for my father was losing his remarkably moderated tone , and threatening polysyllables . He had followed Janet , step for step , at a measured distance , drooping toward her with his winningest air , while the old man pulled at her arm to get her out of hearing of the obnoxious flatterer . She kept her long head in profile , trying creditably not to appear discourteous to one who addressed her by showing an open ear , until the final bolt made by the frenzied old man dragged her through the doorway . His neck was shortened behind his collar as though he shrugged from the blast of a bad wind . I believe that , on the whole , Janet was pleased . I will wager that , left to herself , she would have been drawn into an answer , if not an argument . Nothing would have made her resolution swerve , I admit . They had not been out of the room three seconds when my aunt Dorothy was called to join them . She had found time to say that she hoped the money was intact .
235527	235540	235541	235541	I	0	' Did you scheme to bring Prince Hermann over here as well ? '
235549	235637	235545	235545	He	8158	' I really am not the wonderful wizard you think me , Richie . I left Prince Ernest 's address as mine with Waddy in case the Frau Feld - Marschall should take it into her head to come . Further than that you must question Providence , which I humbly thank for its unfailing support , down to unexpected trifles . Only this to you and to all of them : nothing bends me . I will not be robbed of the fruit of a lifetime . '
235638	235643	235545	235545	He	8158	' Supposing I refuse ? '
235644	235798	235799	235799	I	0	' You refuse , Richie , to restore the princess her character and the prince his serenity of mind at their urgent supplication ? I am utterly unable to suppose it . You are married in the papers this morning . I grieve to say that the position of Prince Hermann is supremely ridiculous . I am bound to add he is a bold boy . It requires courage in one of the pretenders to the hand of the princess to undertake the office of intercessor , for he must know the man must know in his heart that he is doing her no kindness . He does not appeal to me , you see . I have shown that my arrangements are unalterable . What he will make of your grandad ! ... Why on earth he should have been sent to of all men in the world your grandad , Richie ! '
235852	235857	235848	235848	He	7176	' Shut that window ! '
235875	235890	235865	235865	he	7176	' Here , Mr. Richmond , I do n't want all men to know you 're

235921	235958	235959	235959	I	0	' An explanation on the subject of the rooms ensued between the old man and the ladies ; it did not improve his temper . His sense of breeding , nevertheless , forced him to remark , '

236006	236018	235984	235984	I	0	' my father responded with the flourish of a pacifying hand . '

236211	236302	236303	236303	he	7193	're a truthful woman , as I said , and so I wo n't treat you like a witness in a box . You gave it to Harry to help him out of his scrape . Why , short of staring lunacy , did you pass it through the hands of this man ? He sweated his thousands out of it at the start . Why did you make a secret of it to make the man think his nonsense ? Ma'am , behave like a lady and my daughter , '
236346	236434	236337	236337	she	7194	' Tell me your object , Dorothy Beltham , in passing the money through the hands of this man ? Were you for helping him to be a man of his word ? Help the boy that I understand . However , you were mistress of your money ! I 've no right to complain , if you will go spending a fortune to whitewash the blackamoor ! Well , it 's your own , you 'll say . So it is : so 's your character ! '
236447	236627	236628	236631	one of the lot	7195	' You deceived me , ma'am . You would n't build school - houses , you could n't subscribe to Charities , you acted parsimony , to pamper a scamp and his young scholar ! You went to London you did it in cool blood ; you went to your stockbroker , and from the stockbroker to the Bank , and you sold out stock to fling away this big sum . I went to the Bank on business , and the books were turned over for my name , and there at " Beltham " I saw quite by chance the cross of the pen , and I saw your folly , ma'am ; I saw it all in a shot . I went to the Bank on my own business , mind that . Ha ! you know me by this time ; I loathe spying ; the thing jumped out of the book ; I could n't help seeing . Now I do n't reckon how many positive fools go to make one superlative humbug ; you 're
236639	236648	236628	236631	one of the lot	7195	' My father airily begged leave to say : '
236706	236842	236697	236697	I	0	' He talked the stuff for a diversion , presenting in the midst of us an incongruous image of smiles that filled me with I knew not what feelings of angry alienation , until I was somewhat appeased by the idea that he had not apprehended the nature of the words just spoken . It seemed incredible , yet it was true ; it was proved to be so to me by his pricking his ears and his attentive look at the mention of the word prepossessing him in relation to the money : Government . The squire said something of Government to my aunt Dorothy , with sarcastical emphasis . As the observation was unnecessary , and was wantonly thrown in by him , she seized on it to escape from her compromising silence : '

But that she should have a reason , and think it good , in spite of me , and cling to it , defying me , and that she should do hurt to a sentient human creature , who was my father , for the sake of blindly obeying to the letter the injunction of the dead , were intolerable offences to me and common humanity .

It was on her account to open her mind , to enlighten her concerning right and wrong determination , to bring her feelings to bear upon a crude judgement that I condescended to argue the case . Smarting with admiration , both of the depths and shallows of her character , and of her fine figure , I began : She was to consider how young she was to pretend to decide on the balance of duties , how little of the world she had seen ; an oath sworn at the bedside of the dead was a solemn thing , but was it Christian to keep it to do an unnecessary cruelty to the living ? if she had not studied philosophy , she might at least discern the difference between just resolves and insane between those the soul sanctioned , and those hateful to nature ; to bind oneself to carry on another person 's vindictiveness was voluntarily to adopt slavery ; this was flatly - avowed insanity , and so forth , with an emphatic display of patience . The truth of my words could not be controverted . Unhappily I confounded right speaking with right acting , and conceived , because I spoke so justly , that I was specially approved in pressing her to yield . She broke the first pause to say , '

Plenty of foreign whiffmajigs are to be found , but you wo n't come upon a fellow like that . Where he got his money from none knew : all I can say is , I do n't believe he ever did a dirty action for it . And one matter I 'll tell you of : pardon me a moment , Mr. Richmond , I have n't talked English for half a century , or , at least , a quarter . Old Lord Edbury put him down in his will for some thousands , and he risked it to save a lady , who hated him for his pains . Lady Edbury was of the Bolton blood , none of the tamest ; they breed good cavalry men . She ran away from her husband once . The old lord took her back . " It 's at your peril , mind ! " says she . Well , Roy hears by - and - by of afresh affair . He mounted horse ; he was in the saddle , I 've been assured , a night and a day , and posted himself between my lady 's park - gates , and the house , at dusk . The rumour ran that he knew of the marquis playing spy on his wife . However , such was the fact ; she was going off again , and the marquis did play the mean part . She walked down the parkroad , and , seeing the cloaked figure of a man , she imagined him to be her Lothario , and very naturally , you will own , fell into his arms . The gentleman in question was an acquaintance of mine ; and the less you follow our example the better for you . It was a damnable period in morals ! He told me that he saw the scene from the gates , where he had his carriage - and - four ready . The old lord burst out of an ambush on his wife and her supposed paramour ; the lady was imprisoned in her rescuer 's arms , and my friend retired on tiptoe , which was , I incline to think , the best thing he could do . Our morals were abominable . Lady Edbury would never see Roy - Richmond after that , nor the old lord neither . He doubled the sum he had intended to leave him , though . I heard that he married a second young wife . Roy , I believe , ended by marrying a great heiress , and reforming . He was an eloquent fellow , and stood like a general in full uniform , cocked hat and feathers ; most amusing fellow at table ; beat a Frenchman for anecdote . '

255797	256137	255786	255787	A prince	1473	' Those were the words I caught : a reproduction of many of my phrases employed in our arguments on this very subject . He bade his audience to beware of princes , beware of idle princes ; and letting his florid fancy loose on these eminent persons , they were at one moment silver lamps , at another poising hawks , and again sprawling pumpkins ; anything except useful citizens . How could they be ? They had the attraction of the lamp , the appetite of the hawk , the occupation of the pumpkin : nothing was given them to do but to shine , destroy , and fatten . Their hands were kept empty : a trifle in their heads would topple them over ; they were monuments of the English system of compromise . Happy for mankind if they were monuments only ! Happy for them ! But they had the passions of men . The adulation of the multitude was raised to inflate them , whose self - respect had not one prop to rest on , unless it were contempt for the flatterers and prophetic foresight of their perfidy . They were the monuments of a compromise between the past and terror of the future ; puppets as princes , mannikins as men , the snares of frail women , stop - gaps of the State , feathered nonentities ! So far but not in epigram he marshalled the things he had heard to his sound of drum and trumpet , like one repeating a lesson off - hand . Steering on a sudden completely round , he gave his audience an outline of the changes he would have effected had he but triumphed in his cause ; and now came the lashing of arms , a flood of eloquence . Princes with brains , princes leaders , princes flowers of the land , he had offered them ! princes that should sway assemblies , and not stultify the precepts of a decent people '

258119	258124	258092	258092	She	356	' Yes , thoroughly . '
258164	258169	258142	258142	she	356	' Then how long , '
258174	258185	258186	258186	She	356	' how long have you been staying with the princess ? '
258191	258202	258186	258186	She	356	' So long , that I can speak fairish German . '
258203	258209	258186	258186	She	356	' And read it easily ? '
258210	258220	258221	258221	Her	356	' I have actually taken to reading , Harry . '
258275	258282	258259	258259	I	0	' Have you been here months ? '
258283	258289	258290	258290	she	356	' Yes , some months , '
258293	258296	258290	258290	she	356	' Many ? '
258297	258300	258301	258301	she	356	' Yes , '
258319	258341	258342	258342	I	0	' Wait for Temple , Harry . He is a day behind his time . We ca n't account for it . '

258749	258797	258745	258745	ye	7899	' and his glances and excuses , and then I had him up in my room , and the tale was told ; it was not Temple 's fault if he did not begin straightforwardly . I plucked him from his narrator 's vexatious and inevitable commencement : '
258810	258813	258804	258804	she	7900	' He answered '
258816	258817	258818	258818	She	7900	' '
258827	258828	258822	258822	she	7900	' '
258835	258852	258831	258831	she	7900	' said Temple , distracting me by submitting to the lead I distracted him by taking . '
258859	258877	258831	258831	she	7900	' Temple denied it , and a devil seized him to perceive some comicality in the dialogue . '
258882	258885	258879	258879	she	7900	' Temple said '
258888	258900	258879	258879	she	7900	' with a lurking drollery about his lips . He added , '
258910	258911	258908	258908	Richie	448	' '
258929	258965	258920	258920	Edbury	628	' Again Temple pronounced a negative , this time wilfully enigmatical : he confessed it , and accused me of the provocation . He dashed some laughter with gravity to prepare for my next assault . '
258981	258982	258977	258977	he	628	' '
258985	259006	259007	259007	Edbury	628	' was the answer once more . Temple stopped my wrath by catching at me and begging me to listen . '
259013	259014	259007	259007	Edbury	628	' '
259017	259018	259007	259007	Edbury	628	' '
259047	259237	259239	259239	crew	7903	're going to be as happy as I am , or I should n't trifle an instant . He went overnight on board the barque Priscilla to see Mabel Sweetwinter , the only woman he ever could have cared for , and he went the voyage , just as we did . He was trapped , caged , and transported ; it 's a repetition , except that the poor old Priscilla never came to land . She foundered in a storm in the North Sea . That 's all we know . Every soul perished , the captain and all . I knew how it would be with that crew of his some day or other . Do n't you remember my saying the Priscilla was the kind of name of a vessel that would go down with all hands , and leave a bottle to float to shore ? A gin - bottle was found on our East coast - the old captain must have discovered in the last few moments that such things were on board and in it there was a paper , and the passengers '
259331	259342	259344	259344	Temple	448	' Do n't you understand how it was , Richie ? '
259346	259410	259344	259344	Temple	448	' Edbury went to persuade her to stay , or just to see her for once , and he came to persuasions . He seems to have been succeeding , but the captain stepped on board and he treated Edbury as he did us two : he made him take the voyage for discipline 's sake and " his soul 's health . " '
259411	259421	259300	259300	his	448	' How do you know all this , Temple ? '
259422	259512	259513	259513	My	0	' You know your friend Kiomi was one of the party . The captain sent her back on shore because he had no room for her . She told us Edbury offered bribes of hundreds and thousands for the captain to let him and Mabel go off in the boat with Kiomi , and then he took to begging to go alone . He tried to rouse the crew . The poor fellow cringed , she says ; he threatened to swim off . The captain locked him up . '
259558	259601	259555	259555	Temple	448	' Heriot held his tongue about it next morning . He was one of the guests , though he had sworn he would n't go . He said something to Janet that betrayed him , for she had not seen him since . '
259602	259607	259609	259609	I.	0	' How betrayed him ? '
259610	259613	259615	259615	Temple	448	' Why , '
259617	259902	259615	259615	Temple	448	' of course it was Heriot who put Edbury in Kiomi 's hands . Edbury would n't have known of Mabel 's sailing , or known the vessel she was in , without her help . She led him down to the water and posted him in sight before she went to Captain Welsh 's ; and when you and Captain Welsh walked away , Edbury rowed to the Priscilla . Old Heriot is not responsible for the consequences . What he supposed was likely enough . He thought that Edbury and Mabel were much of a pair , and thought , I suppose , that if Edbury saw her he 'd find he could n't leave her , and old Lady Kane , who managed him , would stand nodding her plumes for nothing at the altar . And so she did : and a pretty scene it was . She snatched at the minutes as they slipped past twelve like fishes , and snarled at the parson , and would have kept him standing till one P.M. , if Janet had not turned on her heel . The old woman got in front of her to block her way . " Ah , Temple , " she said to me , " it would be hard if I could not think I had done all that was due to them . " I did n't see her again till she was starting for Germany . And , Richie , she thinks you can never forgive her . She wrote me word that the princess is of another mind , but her own opinion , she says , is based upon knowing you . '
259903	259910	259913	259913	Temple	448	' Good heaven ! how little ! '
260089	260096	260080	260080	I	0	' An odd series of accidents ! '
260277	260287	260290	260291	a boy	8544	' Richie , you have n't changed a bit you 're
260293	260573	260290	260291	a boy	8544	' Certain indications of external gravity , and a sinking of the natural springs within characterized Temple 's approach to the responsible position of a British husband and father . We talked much of Captain Welsh , and the sedate practical irony of his imprisoning one like Edbury to discipline him on high seas , as well as the singular situation of the couple of culprits under his admonishing regimen , and the tragic end . My next two minutes alone with Janet were tempered by it . Only my eagerness for another term of privacy persuaded her that I was her lover instead of judge , and then , having made the discovery that a single - minded gladness animated me in the hope that she and I would travel together one in body and soul , she surrendered , with her last bit of pride broken ; except , it may be , a fragment of reserve traceable in the confession that came quaintly after supreme self - blame , when she said she was bound to tell me that possibly probably , were the trial to come over again , she should again act as she had done . Happily for us both , my wits had been sharpened enough to know that there is more in men and women than the stuff they utter . And blessed privilege now ! if the lips were guilty of nonsense , I might stop them . Besides , I was soon to be master upon such questions . She admitted it , admitting with an unwonted emotional shiver , that absolute freedom could be the worst of perils . '
260577	260585	260290	260291	a boy	8544	' said I. She preferred to say , '
260589	260592	260290	260291	a boy	8544	' and then '
260605	260666	260667	260667	Riversley	251	' Spice of the princess 's conversation flavoured her speech . The signs unfamiliar about her for me were marks of the fire she had come out of ; the struggle , the torture , the determined sacrifice , through pride 's conception of duty . She was iron once . She had come out of the fire finest steel . '
260671	260791	260669	260669	Harry	244	' she murmured , and my smile , and word , and squeeze in reply , brought back a whole gleam of the fresh English morning she had been in face , and voice , and person . Was it conceivable that we could go back to Riversley single ? Before that was answered she had to make a statement ; and in doing it she blushed , because it involved Edbury 's name , and seemed to involve her attachment to him ; but she paid me the compliment of speaking it frankly . It was that she had felt herself bound in honour to pay Edbury 's debts . Even by such slight means as her saying , '
260796	260848	260794	260794	Harry	244	' and my kiss of her fingers when a question of money was in debate , did we burst aside the vestiges of mutual strangeness , and recognize one another , but with an added warmth of love . When I pleaded for the marriage to be soon , she said , '
260855	260917	260853	260853	Harry	244	' Sentiment you do not obtain from a Damascus blade . She most cordially despised the ladies who parade and play on their sex , and are for ever acting according to the feminine standard : a dangerous stretch of contempt for one less strong than she . Riding behind her and Temple one day with the princess , I said , '
260925	260929	260930	260930	Her	356	' She replied , '
261066	261371	261644	261644	you	7932	' I have lived to think that Ottilia was right . As nearly right , too , in the wording of her opinion as one may be in three or four sentences designed to be comprehensive . My Janet 's readiness to meet calamity was shown ere we reached home upon an evening of the late autumn , and set eye on a scene , for her the very saddest that could have been devised to test her spirit of endurance , when , driving up the higher heath - land , we saw the dark sky ominously reddened over Riversley , and , mounting the ridge , had the funeral flames of the old Grange dashed in our faces . The blow was evil , sudden , unaccountable . Villagers , tenants , farm - labourers , groups of a deputation that had gone to the railway station to give us welcome ; and returned , owing to a delay in our arrival , stood gazing from all quarters . The Grange was burning in two great wings , that soared in flame - tips and columns of crimson smoke , leaving the central hall and chambers untouched as yet , but alive inside with mysterious ranges of lights , now curtained , now made bare a feeble contrast to the savage blaze to right and left , save for the wonder aroused as to its significance . These were soon cloaked . Dead sable reigned in them , and at once a jet of flame gave the whole vast building to destruction . My wife thrust her hand in mine . Fire at the heart , fire at the wings our old home stood in that majesty of horror which freezes the limbs of men , bidding them look and no more . '
261380	261388	261374	261374	Riversley	251	' I heard Janet murmur to herself . '
261392	261642	261374	261374	Riversley	251	' she said , when at the South - east wing , where my old grandfather had slept , there burst a glut of flame . We dove down to the park and along the carriage - road to the first red line of gazers . They told us that no living creatures were in the house . My aunt Dorothy was at Bulsted . I perceived my father 's man Tollingby among the servants , and called him to me ; others came , and out of a clatter of tongues , and all eyes fearfully askant at the wall of fire , we gathered that a great reception had been prepared for us by my father : lamps , lights in all the rooms , torches in the hall , illuminations along the windows , stores of fireworks , such a display as only he could have dreamed of . The fire had broken out at dusk , from an explosion of fireworks at one wing and some inexplicable mismanagement at the other . But the house must have been like a mine , what with the powder , the torches , the devices in paper and muslin , and the extraordinary decorations fitted up to celebrate our return in harmony with my father 's fancy . Gentlemen on horseback dashed up to us . Captain Bulsted seized my hand . He was hot from a ride to fetch engines , and sang sharp in my ear , '
