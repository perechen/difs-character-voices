2425	2437	2439	2440	my mother	338	" I do n't know what would have happened , Walter , "
2442	2504	2439	2440	my mother	338	" if you had delayed much longer . Pesca has been half mad with impatience , and I have been half mad with curiosity . The Professor has brought some wonderful news with him , in which he says you are concerned ; and he has cruelly refused to give us the smallest hint of it till his friend Walter appeared . "
2505	2514	2518	2518	herself	134	" Very provoking : it spoils the Set , "
2621	2628	2630	2630	Pesca	135	" Now , my good dears , "
2634	2637	2639	2639	he	135	" good dears "
2641	2644	2639	2639	he	135	" worthy friends "
2646	2665	2630	2630	Pesca	135	" listen to me . The time has come I recite my good news I speak at last . "
2666	2671	2673	2674	my mother	338	" Hear , hear ! "
2680	2690	2692	2692	Sarah	134	" The next thing he will break , mamma , "
2694	2706	2692	2692	Sarah	134	" will be the back of the best arm - chair . "
2707	2726	2728	2728	Pesca	135	" I go back into my life , and I address myself to the noblest of created beings , "
2743	2784	2728	2728	Pesca	135	" Who found me dead at the bottom of the sea through Cramp ; and who pulled me up to the top ; and what did I say when I got into my own life and my own clothes again ? "
2785	2794	2795	2795	I	0	" Much more than was at all necessary , "
2824	2828	2830	2830	Pesca	135	" I said , "
2832	2893	2903	2903	his	442	" that my life belonged to my dear friend , Walter , for the rest of my days and so it does . I said that I should never be happy again till I had found the opportunity of doing a good Something for Walter and I have never been contented with myself till this most blessed day . Now , "
2906	2957	2895	2898	the enthusiastic little man	442	" the overflowing happiness bursts out of me at every pore of my skin , like a perspiration ; for on my faith , and soul , and honour , the something is done at last , and the only word to say now is Right - all - right ! "
3061	3077	3079	3080	the Professor	370	" Among the fine London Houses where I teach the language of my native country , "
3095	3453	3079	3080	the Professor	370	" there is one , mighty fine , in the big place called Portland . You all know where that is ? Yes , yes course - of - course . The fine house , my good dears , has got inside it a fine family . A Mamma , fair and fat ; three young Misses , fair and fat ; two young Misters , fair and fat ; and a Papa , the fairest and the fattest of all , who is a mighty merchant , up to his eyes in gold a fine man once , but seeing that he has got a naked head and two chins , fine no longer at the present time . Now mind ! I teach the sublime Dante to the young Misses , and ah ! my - soul - bless - my - soul ! it is not in human language to say how the sublime Dante puzzles the pretty heads of all three ! No matter all in good time and the more lessons the better for me . Now mind ! Imagine to yourselves that I am teaching the young Misses to - day , as usual . We are all four of us down together in the Hell of Dante . At the Seventh Circle but no matter for that : all the Circles are alike to the three young Misses , fair and fat , at the Seventh Circle , nevertheless , my pupils are sticking fast ; and I , to set them going again , recite , explain , and blow myself up red - hot with useless enthusiasm , when a creak of boots in the passage outside , and in comes the golden Papa , the mighty merchant with the naked head and the two chins . Ha ! my good dears , I am closer than you think for to the business , now . Have you been patient so far ? or have you said to yourselves , ' Deuce - what - the - deuce ! Pesca is long - winded to - night ? ' "
3467	3791	3462	3463	The Professor	370	" In his hand , the golden Papa has a letter ; and after he has made his excuse for disturbing us in our Infernal Region with the common mortal Business of the house , he addresses himself to the three young Misses , and begins , as you English begin everything in this blessed world that you have to say , with a great O. ' O , my dears , ' says the mighty merchant , ' I have got here a letter from my friend , Mr. ' the name has slipped out of my mind ; but no matter ; we shall come back to that ; yes , yes right - all - right . So the Papa says , ' I have got a letter from my friend , the Mister ; and he wants a recommend from me , of a drawing - master , to go down to his house in the country . ' My - soul - bless - my - soul ! when I heard the golden Papa say those words , if I had been big enough to reach up to him , I should have put my arms round his neck , and pressed him to my bosom in a long and grateful hug ! As it was , I only bounced upon my chair . My seat was on thorns , and my soul was on fire to speak but I held my tongue , and let Papa go on . ' Perhaps you know , ' says this good man of money , twiddling his friend 's letter this way and that , in his golden fingers and thumbs , ' perhaps you know , my dears , of a drawing - master that I can recommend ? ' The three young Misses all look at each other , and then say with the indispensable great O to begin "
4492	4522	4523	4524	My mother	338	" Here the Professor waved the memorandum of terms over his head , and ended his long and voluble narrative with his shrill Italian parody on an English cheer . "
4549	4556	4557	4557	she	338	" My dear , good Pesca , "
4560	4580	4557	4557	she	338	" I never doubted your true affection for Walter but I am more than ever persuaded of it now ! "
4581	4599	4601	4601	Sarah	134	" I am sure we are very much obliged to Professor Pesca , for Walter 's sake , "
4645	4664	4642	4642	her	134	" If the familiar little man treats my mother in that way , how will he treat ME ? "
4788	4791	4793	4795	the little man	386	" Read ! "
4798	4820	4793	4795	the little man	386	" I promise you my friend , the writing of the golden Papa speaks with a tongue of trumpets for itself . "
5213	5228	5234	5234	she	338	" Oh , Walter , your father never had such a chance as this ! "
5249	5256	5258	5258	Sarah	134	" Such distinguished people to know , "
5266	5276	5258	5258	Sarah	134	" and on such gratifying terms of equality too ! "
5277	5293	5294	5294	I	0	" Yes , yes ; the terms , in every sense , are tempting enough , "
5298	5315	5294	5294	I	0	" But before I send in my testimonials , I should like a little time to consider "
5316	5319	5321	5322	my mother	338	" Consider ! "
5324	5336	5321	5322	my mother	338	" Why , Walter , what is the matter with you ? "
5337	5340	5342	5343	my sister	347	" Consider ! "
5345	5358	5342	5343	my sister	347	" What a very extraordinary thing to say , under the circumstances ! "
5359	5362	5365	5366	the Professor	370	" Consider ! "
5368	5581	5365	5366	the Professor	370	" What is there to consider about ? Answer me this ! Have you not been complaining of your health , and have you not been longing for what you call a smack of the country breeze ? Well ! there in your hand is the paper that offers you perpetual choking mouthfuls of country breeze for four months ' time . Is it not so ? Ha ! Again you want money . Well ! Is four golden guineas a week nothing ? My - soul - bless - my - soul ! only give it to me and my boots shall creak like the golden Papa 's , with a sense of the overpowering richness of the man who walks in them ! Four guineas a week , and , more than that , the charming society of two young misses ! and , more than that , your bed , your breakfast , your dinner , your gorging English teas and lunches and drinks of foaming beer , all for nothing why , Walter , my dear good friend deuce - what - the - deuce ! for the first time in my life I have not eyes enough in my head to look , and wonder at you ! "
6020	6026	6028	6030	my little friend	524	" A secret , Walter , "
6039	6084	6028	6030	my little friend	524	" I am flushed by the recollection of my own eloquence . My soul bursts itself with ambition . One of these days I go into your noble Parliament . It is the dream of my whole life to be Honourable Pesca , M.P. ! "
6206	6216	6218	6219	the Professor	370	" I shall dry my tears in your absence , "
6222	6306	6218	6219	the Professor	370	" with this glorious thought . It is my auspicious hand that has given the first push to your fortune in the world . Go , my friend ! When your sun shines in Cumberland English proverb , in the name of heaven make your hay . Marry one of the two young Misses ; become Honourable Hartright , M.P. ; and when you are on the top of the ladder remember that Pesca , at the bottom , has done it all ! "
7059	7067	7068	7068	she	561	" Is that the road to London ? "
7388	7394	7395	7395	she	558	" Did you hear me ? "
7411	7422	7395	7395	she	558	" I asked if that was the way to London . "
7423	7426	7427	7427	I	0	" Yes , "
7430	7484	7427	7427	I	0	" that is the way : it leads to St. John 's Wood and the Regent 's Park . You must excuse my not answering you before . I was rather startled by your sudden appearance in the road ; and I am , even now , quite unable to account for it . "
7485	7531	7395	7395	she	558	" You do n't suspect me of doing anything wrong , do you ? I have done nothing wrong . I have met with an accident I am very unfortunate in being here alone so late . Why do you suspect me of doing wrong ? "
7556	7570	7571	7571	I	0	" Pray do n't suppose that I have any idea of suspecting you , "
7574	7616	7571	7571	I	0	" or any other wish than to be of assistance to you , if I can . I only wondered at your appearance in the road , because it seemed to me to be empty the instant before I saw you . "
7649	7655	7656	7656	she	568	" I heard you coming , "
7659	7701	7656	7656	she	568	" and hid there to see what sort of man you were , before I risked speaking . I doubted and feared about it till you passed ; and then I was obliged to steal after you , and touch you . "
7724	7730	7731	7731	she	568	" May I trust you ? "
7734	7751	7731	7731	she	568	" You do n't think the worse of me because I have met with an accident ? "
7825	7835	7836	7836	I	0	" You may trust me for any harmless purpose , "
7839	7889	7836	7836	I	0	" If it troubles you to explain your strange situation to me , do n't think of returning to the subject again . I have no right to ask you for any explanations . Tell me how I can help you ; and if I can , I will . "
7890	7908	7923	7923	her	568	" You are very kind , and I am very , very thankful to have met you . "
7952	7962	7963	7963	she	568	" I have only been in London once before , "
7972	8063	7963	7963	she	568	" and I know nothing about that side of it , yonder . Can I get a fly , or a carriage of any kind ? Is it too late ? I do n't know . If you could show me where to get a fly and if you will only promise not to interfere with me , and to let me leave you , when and how I please I have a friend in London who will be glad to receive me I want nothing else will you promise ? "
8088	8093	8074	8074	her	568	" Will you promise ? "
8227	8247	8248	8248	I	0	" Are you sure that your friend in London will receive you at such a late hour as this ? "
8251	8281	8248	8248	I	0	" Quite sure . Only say you will let me leave you when and how I please only say you wo n't interfere with me . Will you promise ? "
8348	8353	8344	8345	a woman	319	" Will you promise ? "
8354	8357	8344	8345	a woman	319	" Yes . "
8543	8551	8552	8552	she	582	" I want to ask you something , "
8556	8565	8552	8552	she	582	" Do you know many people in London ? "
8566	8573	8532	8532	her	582	" Yes , a great many . "
8574	8582	8532	8532	her	582	" Many men of rank and title ? "
8601	8604	8605	8605	I	0	" Some , "
8614	8616	8617	8617	she	582	" Many "
8631	8640	8617	8617	she	582	" many men of the rank of Baronet ? "
8654	8660	8647	8647	I	0	" Why do you ask ? "
8661	8681	8617	8617	she	582	" Because I hope , for my own sake , there is one Baronet that you do n't know . "
8682	8690	8647	8647	I	0	" Will you tell me his name ? "
8691	8706	8707	8707	She	582	" I ca n't I dare n't I forget myself when I mention it . "
8746	8755	8734	8734	herself	582	" Tell me which of them YOU know . "
8811	8819	8820	8820	she	582	" Ah ! you DON'T know him , "
8829	8840	8820	8820	she	582	" Are you a man of rank and title yourself ? "
8841	8854	8866	8866	she	582	" Far from it . I am only a drawing - master . "
8879	8888	8889	8889	she	582	" Not a man of rank and title , "
8894	8903	8889	8889	she	582	" Thank God ! I may trust HIM . "
8928	8946	8947	8947	I	0	" I am afraid you have serious reason to complain of some man of rank and title ? "
8950	8990	8947	8947	I	0	" I am afraid the baronet , whose name you are unwilling to mention to me , has done you some grievous wrong ? Is he the cause of your being out here at this strange time of night ? "
8991	9005	9006	9006	she	593	" Do n't ask me : do n't make me talk of it , "
9009	9056	9006	9006	she	593	" I 'm not fit now . I have been cruelly used and cruelly wronged . You will be kinder than ever , if you will walk on fast , and not speak to me . I sadly want to quiet myself , if I can . "
9157	9164	9165	9165	she	593	" Do you live in London ? "
9168	9171	9180	9180	she	593	" Yes . "
9219	9241	9216	9216	I	0	" But to - morrow I shall be away from London for some time . I am going into the country . "
9242	9245	9246	9246	she	593	" Where ? "
9249	9254	9216	9216	I	0	" North or south ? "
9255	9260	9216	9216	I	0	" North to Cumberland . "
9261	9264	9265	9265	she	593	" Cumberland ! "
9271	9288	9265	9265	she	593	" Ah ! wish I was going there too . I was once happy in Cumberland . "
9304	9310	9311	9311	I	0	" Perhaps you were born , "
9314	9321	9311	9311	I	0	" in the beautiful Lake country . "
9322	9325	9326	9326	she	593	" No , "
9329	9374	9326	9326	she	593	" I was born in Hampshire ; but I once went to school for a little while in Cumberland . Lakes ? I do n't remember any lakes . It 's Limmeridge village , and Limmeridge House , I should like to see again . "
9420	9429	9430	9430	she	587	" Did you hear anybody calling after us ? "
9446	9475	9430	9430	she	587	" No , no . I was only struck by the name of Limmeridge House . I heard it mentioned by some Cumberland people a few days since . "
9476	9540	9550	9550	she	587	" Ah ! not my people . Mrs. Fairlie is dead ; and her husband is dead ; and their little girl may be married and gone away by this time . I ca n't say who lives at Limmeridge now . If any more are left there of that name , I only know I love them for Mrs. Fairlie 's sake . "
9587	9595	9596	9596	she	587	" Is the turnpike man looking out ? "
9639	9644	9645	9645	she	587	" This is London , "
9648	9675	9645	9645	she	587	" Do you see any carriage I can get ? I am tired and frightened . I want to shut myself in and be driven away . "
9837	9843	9844	9844	she	587	" It 's so late , "
9847	9860	9844	9844	she	587	" I am only in a hurry because it 's so late . "
9861	9880	9882	9883	the driver	616	" I ca n't take you , sir , if you 're not going towards Tottenham Court Road , "
9893	9912	9882	9883	the driver	616	" My horse is dead beat , and I ca n't get him no further than the stable . "
9913	9935	9936	9936	She	587	" Yes , yes . That will do for me . I 'm going that way I 'm going that way . "
9995	10002	10003	10003	she	587	" No , no , no , "
10007	10047	10003	10003	she	587	" I 'm quite safe , and quite happy now . If you are a gentleman , remember your promise . Let him drive on till I stop him . Thank you oh ! thank you , thank you ! "
10344	10347	10349	10349	one	634	" Stop ! "
10351	10362	10349	10349	one	634	" There 's a policeman . Let 's ask him . "
10381	10384	10386	10388	the first speaker	637	" Policeman ! "
10390	10400	10386	10388	the first speaker	637	" Have you seen a woman pass this way ? "
10401	10409	10341	10342	two men	633	" What sort of woman , sir ? "
10410	10419	10386	10388	the first speaker	637	" A woman in a lavender - coloured gown "
10420	10425	10427	10429	the second man	638	" No , no , "
10431	10469	10427	10429	the second man	638	" The clothes we gave her were found on her bed . She must have gone away in the clothes she wore when she came to us . In white , policeman . A woman in white . "
10470	10479	10386	10388	the first speaker	637	" I have n't seen her , sir . "
10480	10520	10427	10429	the second man	638	" If you or any of your men meet with the woman , stop her , and send her in careful keeping to that address . I 'll pay all expenses , and a fair reward into the bargain . "
10534	10549	10427	10429	the second man	638	" Why are we to stop her , sir ? What has she done ? "
10550	10572	10427	10429	the second man	638	" Done ! She has escaped from my Asylum . Do n't forget ; a woman in white . Drive on . "
10574	10582	10427	10429	the second man	638	" She has escaped from my Asylum ! "
11452	11459	11463	11463	him	675	" Breakfast at nine o'clock , sir "
11478	11490	11491	11491	I	0	" What shall I see in my dreams to - night ? "
11503	11518	11497	11497	I	0	" the woman in white ? or the unknown inhabitants of this Cumberland mansion ? "
12361	12365	12367	12368	the lady	703	" Mr. Hartright ? "
12392	12451	12387	12387	she	703	" We resigned all hope of you last night , and went to bed as usual . Accept my apologies for our apparent want of attention ; and allow me to introduce myself as one of your pupils . Shall we shake hands ? I suppose we must come to it sooner or later and why not sooner ? "
12537	12555	12557	12558	the lady	703	" I hope you come here good - humouredly determined to make the best of your position , "
12560	12905	12557	12558	the lady	703	" You will have to begin this morning by putting up with no other company at breakfast than mine . My sister is in her own room , nursing that essentially feminine malady , a slight headache ; and her old governess , Mrs. Vesey , is charitably attending on her with restorative tea . My uncle , Mr. Fairlie , never joins us at any of our meals : he is an invalid , and keeps bachelor state in his own apartments . There is nobody else in the house but me . Two young ladies have been staying here , but they went away yesterday , in despair ; and no wonder . All through their visit in consequence of Mr. Fairlie 's invalid condition we produced no such convenience in the house as a flirtable , danceable , small - talkable creature of the male sex ; and the consequence was , we did nothing but quarrel , especially at dinner - time . How can you expect four women to dine together alone every day , and not quarrel ? We are such fools , we ca n't entertain each other at table . You see I do n't think much of my own sex , Mr. Hartright which will you have , tea or coffee ? no woman does think much of her own sex , although few of them confess it as freely as I do . Dear me , you look puzzled . Why ? Are you wondering what you will have for breakfast ? or are you surprised at my careless way of talking ? In the first case , I advise you , as a friend , to have nothing to do with that cold ham at your elbow , and to wait till the omelette comes in . In the second case , I will give you some tea to compose your spirits , and do all a woman can which is very little , by - the - bye to hold my tongue . "
13033	13038	13039	13039	she	715	" Yes , yes , "
13060	13843	13039	13039	she	715	" I understand . You are such a perfect stranger in the house , that you are puzzled by my familiar references to the worthy inhabitants . Natural enough : I ought to have thought of it before . At any rate , I can set it right now . Suppose I begin with myself , so as to get done with that part of the subject as soon as possible ? My name is Marian Halcombe ; and I am as inaccurate as women usually are , in calling Mr. Fairlie my uncle , and Miss Fairlie my sister . My mother was twice married : the first time to Mr. Halcombe , my father ; the second time to Mr. Fairlie , my half - sister 's father . Except that we are both orphans , we are in every respect as unlike each other as possible . My father was a poor man , and Miss Fairlie 's father was a rich man . I have got nothing , and she has a fortune . I am dark and ugly , and she is fair and pretty . Everybody thinks me crabbed and odd with perfect justice ; and everybody thinks her sweet - tempered and charming with more justice still . In short , she is an angel ; and I am Try some of that marmalade , Mr. Hartright , and finish the sentence , in the name of female propriety , for yourself . What am I to tell you about Mr. Fairlie ? Upon my honour , I hardly know . He is sure to send for you after breakfast , and you can study him for yourself . In the meantime , I may inform you , first , that he is the late Mr. Fairlie 's younger brother ; secondly , that he is a single man ; and thirdly , that he is Miss Fairlie 's guardian . I wo n't live without her , and she ca n't live without me ; and that is how I come to be at Limmeridge House . My sister and I are honestly fond of each other ; which , you will say , is perfectly unaccountable , under the circumstances , and I quite agree with you but so it is . You must please both of us , Mr. Hartright , or please neither of us : and , what is still more trying , you will be thrown entirely upon our society . Mrs. Vesey is an excellent person , who possesses all the cardinal virtues , and counts for nothing ; and Mr. Fairlie is too great an invalid to be a companion for anybody . I do n't know what is the matter with him , and the doctors do n't know what is the matter with him , and he does n't know himself what is the matter with him . We all say it 's on the nerves , and we none of us know what we mean when we say it . However , I advise you to humour his little peculiarities , when you see him to - day . Admire his collection of coins , prints , and water - colour drawings , and you will win his heart . Upon my word , if you can be contented with a quiet country life , I do n't see why you should not get on very well here . From breakfast to lunch , Mr. Fairlie 's drawings will occupy you . After lunch , Miss Fairlie and I shoulder our sketch - books , and go out to misrepresent Nature , under your directions . Drawing is her favourite whim , mind , not mine . Women ca n't draw their minds are too flighty , and their eyes are too inattentive . No matter my sister likes it ; so I waste paint and spoil paper , for her sake , as composedly as any woman in England . As for the evenings , I think we can help you through them . Miss Fairlie plays delightfully . For my own poor part , I do n't know one note of music from the other ; but I can match you at chess , backgammon , ecarte , and with the inevitable female drawbacks even at billiards as well . What do you think of the programme ? Can you reconcile yourself to our quiet , regular life ? or do you mean to be restless , and secretly thirst for change and adventure , in the humdrum atmosphere of Limmeridge House ? "
13894	13897	13903	13903	her	718	" adventure , "
13956	13967	13968	13968	I	0	" Even if I were the most restless of mankind , "
13971	14041	13968	13968	I	0	" I should be in no danger of thirsting after adventures for some time to come . The very night before I arrived at this house , I met with an adventure ; and the wonder and excitement of it , I can assure you , Miss Halcombe , will last me for the whole term of my stay in Cumberland , if not for a much longer period . "
14042	14057	14139	14142	the woman in white	628	" You do n't say so , Mr. Hartright ! May I hear it ? "
14058	14110	13968	13968	I	0	" You have a claim to hear it . The chief person in the adventure was a total stranger to me , and may perhaps be a total stranger to you ; but she certainly mentioned the name of the late Mrs. Fairlie in terms of the sincerest gratitude and regard . "
14111	14127	14154	14154	she	628	" Mentioned my mother 's name ! You interest me indescribably . Pray go on . "
14221	14234	14235	14235	she	153	" Are you quite sure of those words referring to my mother ? "
14238	14242	14243	14243	I	0	" Quite sure , "
14246	14324	14243	14243	I	0	" Whoever she may be , the woman was once at school in the village of Limmeridge , was treated with especial kindness by Mrs. Fairlie , and , in grateful remembrance of that kindness , feels an affectionate interest in all surviving members of the family . She knew that Mrs. Fairlie and her husband were both dead ; and she spoke of Miss Fairlie as if they had known each other when they were children . "
14325	14340	14191	14191	Her	153	" You said , I think , that she denied belonging to this place ? "
14341	14352	14243	14243	I	0	" Yes , she told me she came from Hampshire . "
14353	14364	14191	14191	Her	153	" And you entirely failed to find out her name ? "
14365	14368	14243	14243	I	0	" Entirely . "
14369	14604	14191	14191	Her	153	" Very strange . I think you were quite justified , Mr. Hartright , in giving the poor creature her liberty , for she seems to have done nothing in your presence to show herself unfit to enjoy it . But I wish you had been a little more resolute about finding out her name . We must really clear up this mystery , in some way . You had better not speak of it yet to Mr. Fairlie , or to my sister . They are both of them , I am certain , quite as ignorant of who the woman is , and of what her past history in connection with us can be , as I am myself . But they are also , in widely different ways , rather nervous and sensitive ; and you would only fidget one and alarm the other to no purpose . As for myself , I am all aflame with curiosity , and I devote my whole energies to the business of discovery from this moment . When my mother came here , after her second marriage , she certainly established the village school just as it exists at the present time . But the old teachers are all dead , or gone elsewhere ; and no enlightenment is to be hoped for from that quarter . The only other alternative I can think of "
14643	14649	14651	14652	Miss Halcombe	153	" Wait in the hall , "
14667	14681	14682	14682	she	153	" Mr. Hartright will come out directly . I was about to say , "
14690	14867	14682	14682	she	153	" that my sister and I have a large collection of my mother 's letters , addressed to my father and to hers . In the absence of any other means of getting information , I will pass the morning in looking over my mother 's correspondence with Mr. Fairlie . He was fond of London , and was constantly away from his country home ; and she was accustomed , at such times , to write and report to him how things went on at Limmeridge . Her letters are full of references to the school in which she took so strong an interest ; and I think it more than likely that I may have discovered something when we meet again . The luncheon hour is two , Mr. Hartright . I shall have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister by that time , and we will occupy the afternoon in driving round the neighbourhood and showing you all our pet points of view . Till two o'clock , then , farewell . "
14985	15003	15005	15006	the man	452	" I have my master 's orders to show you your own sitting - room , sir , "
15008	15022	15005	15006	the man	452	" and to inquire if you approve of the situation and the light . "
15323	15327	15277	15278	The servant	368	" Mr. Hartright , "
16068	16142	16055	16057	some tiny jeweller	762	" and a little bottle of liquid , all waiting to be used in various ways for the removal of any accidental impurities which might be discovered on the coins . His frail white fingers were listlessly toying with something which looked , to my uninstructed eyes , like a dirty pewter medal with ragged edges , when I advanced within a respectful distance of his chair , and stopped to make my bow .
16143	16155	16156	16156	he	143	" So glad to possess you at Limmeridge , Mr. Hartright , "
16185	16230	16156	16156	he	143	" Pray sit down . And do n't trouble yourself to move the chair , please . In the wretched state of my nerves , movement of any kind is exquisitely painful to me . Have you seen your studio ? Will it do ? "
16231	16248	16249	16249	He	143	" I have just come from seeing the room , Mr. Fairlie ; and I assure you "
16288	16357	16249	16249	He	143	" Pray excuse me . But could you contrive to speak in a lower key ? In the wretched state of my nerves , loud sound of any kind is indescribable torture to me . You will pardon an invalid ? I only say to you what the lamentable state of my health obliges me to say to everybody . Yes . And you really like the room ? "
16358	16370	16371	16371	I	0	" I could wish for nothing prettier and nothing more comfortable , "
16402	16576	16587	16587	he	763	" So glad . You will find your position here , Mr. Hartright , properly recognised . There is none of the horrid English barbarity of feeling about the social position of an artist in this house . So much of my early life has been passed abroad , that I have quite cast my insular skin in that respect . I wish I could say the same of the gentry detestable word , but I suppose I must use it of the gentry in the neighbourhood . They are sad Goths in Art , Mr. Hartright . People , I do assure you , who would have opened their eyes in astonishment , if they had seen Charles the Fifth pick up Titian 's brush for him . Do you mind putting this tray of coins back in the cabinet , and giving me the next one to it ? In the wretched state of my nerves , exertion of any kind is unspeakably disagreeable to me . Yes . Thank you . "
16651	16696	16620	16620	He	763	" A thousand thanks and a thousand excuses . Do you like coins ? Yes . So glad we have another taste in common besides our taste for Art . Now , about the pecuniary arrangements between us do tell me are they satisfactory ? "
16697	16704	16811	16813	a new servant	764	" Most satisfactory , Mr. Fairlie . "
16705	16806	16620	16620	He	763	" So glad . And what next ? Ah ! I remember . Yes . In reference to the consideration which you are good enough to accept for giving me the benefit of your accomplishments in art , my steward will wait on you at the end of the first week , to ascertain your wishes . And what next ? Curious , is it not ? I had a great deal more to say : and I appear to have quite forgotten it . Do you mind touching the bell ? In that corner . Yes . Thank you . "
16836	16839	16841	16842	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Louis , "
16861	16890	16849	16849	his	143	" I made some entries in my tablettes this morning . Find my tablettes . A thousand pardons , Mr. Hartright , I 'm afraid I bore you . "
16990	16996	16998	16999	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Yes . Just so ! "
17005	17013	17014	17014	He	143	" Louis , take down that portfolio . "
17033	17244	17014	17014	He	143	" No . Not the one with the green back that contains my Rembrandt etchings , Mr. Hartright . Do you like etchings ? Yes ? So glad we have another taste in common . The portfolio with the red back , Louis . Do n't drop it ! You have no idea of the tortures I should suffer , Mr. Hartright , if Louis dropped that portfolio . Is it safe on the chair ? Do YOU think it safe , Mr. Hartright ? Yes ? So glad . Will you oblige me by looking at the drawings , if you really think they are quite safe . Louis , go away . What an ass you are . Do n't you see me holding the tablettes ? Do you suppose I want to hold them ? Then why not relieve me of the tablettes without being told ? A thousand pardons , Mr. Hartright ; servants are such asses , are they not ? Do tell me what do you think of the drawings ? They have come from a sale in a shocking state I thought they smelt of horrid dealers ' and brokers ' fingers when I looked at them last . CAN you undertake them ? "
17328	17332	17333	17333	I	0	" The drawings , "
17336	17353	17333	17333	I	0	" require careful straining and mounting ; and , in my opinion , they are well worth "
17354	17360	17362	17363	Mr. Fairlie	143	" I beg your pardon , "
17365	17388	17362	17363	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Do you mind my closing my eyes while you speak ? Even this light is too much for them . Yes ? "
17389	17406	17333	17333	I	0	" I was about to say that the drawings are well worth all the time and trouble "
17431	17442	17443	17443	he	143	" I entreat you to excuse me , Mr. Hartright , "
17450	17466	17443	17443	he	143	" But surely I hear some horrid children in the garden my private garden below ? "
17467	17481	17362	17363	Mr. Fairlie	143	" I ca n't say , Mr. Fairlie . I heard nothing myself . "
17482	17546	17443	17443	he	143	" Oblige me you have been so very good in humouring my poor nerves oblige me by lifting up a corner of the blind . Do n't let the sun in on me , Mr. Hartright ! Have you got the blind up ? Yes ? Then will you be so very kind as to look into the garden and make quite sure ? "
17591	17686	17687	17687	He	143	" A thousand thanks . My fancy , I suppose . There are no children , thank Heaven , in the house ; but the servants persons born without nerves will encourage the children from the village . Such brats oh , dear me , such brats ! Shall I confess it , Mr. Hartright ? I sadly want a reform in the construction of children . Nature 's only idea seems to be to make them machines for the production of incessant noise . Surely our delightful Raffaello 's conception is infinitely preferable ? "
17726	17732	17734	17735	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Quite a model family ! "
17742	17833	17734	17735	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Such nice round faces , and such nice soft wings , and nothing else . No dirty little legs to run about on , and no noisy little lungs to scream with . How immeasurably superior to the existing construction ! I will close my eyes again , if you will allow me . And you really can manage the drawings ? So glad . Is there anything else to settle ? if there is , I think I have forgotten it . Shall we ring for Louis again ? "
17889	17903	17904	17904	I	0	" The only point , Mr. Fairlie , that remains to be discussed , "
17907	17930	17904	17904	I	0	" refers , I think , to the instruction in sketching which I am engaged to communicate to the two young ladies . "
17931	17937	17939	17940	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Ah ! just so , "
17942	18081	17939	17940	Mr. Fairlie	143	" I wish I felt strong enough to go into that part of the arrangement but I do n't . The ladies who profit by your kind services , Mr. Hartright , must settle , and decide , and so on , for themselves . My niece is fond of your charming art . She knows just enough about it to be conscious of her own sad defects . Please take pains with her . Yes . Is there anything else ? No . We quite understand each other do n't we ? I have no right to detain you any longer from your delightful pursuit have I ? So pleasant to have settled everything such a sensible relief to have done business . Do you mind ringing for Louis to carry the portfolio to your own room ? "
18082	18099	17904	17904	I	0	" I will carry it there myself , Mr. Fairlie , if you will allow me . "
18100	18200	17939	17940	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Will you really ? Are you strong enough ? How nice to be so strong ! Are you sure you wo n't drop it ? So glad to possess you at Limmeridge , Mr. Hartright . I am such a sufferer that I hardly dare hope to enjoy much of your society . Would you mind taking great pains not to let the doors bang , and not to drop the portfolio ? Thank you . Gently with the curtains , please the slightest noise from them goes through me like a knife . Yes . GOOD morning ! "
18612	18623	18589	18590	Mrs. Vesey	149	" all the cardinal virtues , and counting for nothing . "
18941	18947	18949	18950	Miss Halcombe	153	" Now , Mrs. Vesey , "
18973	18982	18965	18971	the undemonstrative old lady at her side	811	" what will you have ? A cutlet ? "
19002	19007	18986	18986	her	149	" Yes , dear . "
19008	19036	19037	19038	Mrs. Vesey	149	" What is that opposite Mr. Hartright ? Boiled chicken , is it not ? I thought you liked boiled chicken better than cutlet , Mrs. Vesey ? "
19067	19072	19037	19038	Mrs. Vesey	149	" Yes , dear . "
19073	19102	19103	19104	Mrs. Vesey	149	" Well , but which will you have , to - day ? Shall Mr. Hartright give you some chicken ? or shall I give you some cutlet ? "
19126	19133	19108	19108	her	149	" Which you please , dear . "
19134	19183	19184	19185	Mrs. Vesey	149	" Mercy on me ! it 's a question for your taste , my good lady , not for mine . Suppose you have a little of both ? and suppose you begin with the chicken , because Mr. Hartright looks devoured by anxiety to carve for you . "
19216	19223	19184	19185	Mrs. Vesey	149	" If you please , sir . "
19303	19311	19312	19312	she	153	" I understand you , Mr. Hartright , "
19315	19374	19312	19312	she	153	" you are wondering what has become of your other pupil . She has been downstairs , and has got over her headache ; but has not sufficiently recovered her appetite to join us at lunch . If you will put yourself under my charge , I think I can undertake to find her somewhere in the garden . "
19470	19477	19478	19478	she	153	" That mysterious adventure of yours , "
19577	19577	19569	19569	my	0	"
19622	19633	19635	19636	Miss Halcombe	153	" And how did you get on with Mr. Fairlie ? "
19649	19712	19635	19636	Miss Halcombe	153	" Was he particularly nervous this morning ? Never mind considering about your answer , Mr. Hartright . The mere fact of your being obliged to consider is enough for me . I see in your face that he WAS particularly nervous ; and , as I am amiably unwilling to throw you into the same condition , I ask no more . "
21114	21121	21122	21122	she	836	" Look there , Mr. Hartright , "
21149	21195	21122	21122	she	836	" Surely you will acknowledge that your model pupil is found at last ? The moment she hears that you are in the house , she seizes her inestimable sketch - book , looks universal Nature straight in the face , and longs to begin ! "
21228	21242	21243	21243	she	836	" I must not take credit to myself where no credit is due , "
21261	21337	21243	21243	she	836	" Fond as I am of drawing , I am so conscious of my own ignorance that I am more afraid than anxious to begin . Now I know you are here , Mr. Hartright , I find myself looking over my sketches , as I used to look over my lessons when I was a little girl , and when I was sadly afraid that I should turn out not fit to be heard . "
21388	21396	21397	21397	she	153	" Good , bad , or indifferent , "
21400	21528	21397	21397	she	153	" the pupil 's sketches must pass through the fiery ordeal of the master 's judgment and there 's an end of it . Suppose we take them with us in the carriage , Laura , and let Mr. Hartright see them , for the first time , under circumstances of perpetual jolting and interruption ? If we can only confuse him all through the drive , between Nature as it is , when he looks up at the view , and Nature as it is not when he looks down again at our sketch - books , we shall drive him into the last desperate refuge of paying us compliments , and shall slip through his professional fingers with our pet feathers of vanity all unruffled . "
21529	21540	21542	21543	Miss Fairlie	151	" I hope Mr. Hartright will pay ME no compliments , "
21554	21566	21567	21567	I	0	" May I venture to inquire why you express that hope ? "
21570	21582	21583	21583	she	151	" Because I shall believe all that you say to me , "
23555	23559	23560	23560	she	153	" Mr. Hartright , "
23563	23579	23560	23560	she	153	" will you come here for a minute ? I want to speak to you . "
23707	23723	23725	23726	Miss Halcombe	153	" I want you to listen while I read the concluding passages in this letter , "
23728	23817	23725	23726	Miss Halcombe	153	" Tell me if you think they throw any light upon your strange adventure on the road to London . The letter is addressed by my mother to her second husband , Mr. Fairlie , and the date refers to a period of between eleven and twelve years since . At that time Mr. and Mrs. Fairlie , and my half - sister Laura , had been living for years in this house ; and I was away from them completing my education at a school in Paris . "
23886	23943	23878	23879	Miss Halcombe	153	" ' You will be tired , my dear Philip , of hearing perpetually about my schools and my scholars . Lay the blame , pray , on the dull uniformity of life at Limmeridge , and not on me . Besides , this time I have something really interesting to tell you about a new scholar .
23944	24044	23878	23879	Miss Halcombe	153	" ' You know old Mrs. Kempe at the village shop . Well , after years of ailing , the doctor has at last given her up , and she is dying slowly day by day . Her only living relation , a sister , arrived last week to take care of her . This sister comes all the way from Hampshire her name is Mrs. Catherick . Four days ago Mrs. Catherick came here to see me , and brought her only child with her , a sweet little girl about a year older than our darling Laura ' "
24105	24362	24086	24087	Miss Halcombe	153	" ' Mrs. Catherick is a decent , well - behaved , respectable woman ; middle - aged , and with the remains of having been moderately , only moderately , nice - looking . There is something in her manner and in her appearance , however , which I ca n't make out . She is reserved about herself to the point of downright secrecy , and there is a look in her face I ca n't describe it which suggests to me that she has something on her mind . She is altogether what you would call a walking mystery . Her errand at Limmeridge House , however , was simple enough . When she left Hampshire to nurse her sister , Mrs. Kempe , through her last illness , she had been obliged to bring her daughter with her , through having no one at home to take care of the little girl . Mrs. Kempe may die in a week 's time , or may linger on for months ; and Mrs. Catherick 's object was to ask me to let her daughter , Anne , have the benefit of attending my school , subject to the condition of her being removed from it to go home again with her mother , after Mrs. Kempe 's death . I consented at once , and when Laura and I went out for our walk , we took the little girl who is just eleven years old to the school that very day . ' "
24419	24771	24772	24772	I	0	" ' I have taken a violent fancy , Philip , to my new scholar , for a reason which I mean to keep till the last for the sake of surprising you . Her mother having told me as little about the child as she told me of herself , I was left to discover which I did on the first day when we tried her at lessons that the poor little thing 's intellect is not developed as it ought to be at her age . Seeing this I had her up to the house the next day , and privately arranged with the doctor to come and watch her and question her , and tell me what he thought . His opinion is that she will grow out of it . But he says her careful bringing - up at school is a matter of great importance just now , because her unusual slowness in acquiring ideas implies an unusual tenacity in keeping them , when they are once received into her mind . Now , my love , you must not imagine , in your off - hand way , that I have been attaching myself to an idiot . This poor little Anne Catherick is a sweet , affectionate , grateful girl , and says the quaintest , prettiest things as you shall judge by an instance , in the most oddly sudden , surprised , half - frightened way . Although she is dressed very neatly , her clothes show a sad want of taste in colour and pattern . So I arranged , yesterday , that some of our darling Laura 's old white frocks and white hats should be altered for Anne Catherick , explaining to her that little girls of her complexion looked neater and better all in white than in anything else . She hesitated and seemed puzzled for a minute , then flushed up , and appeared to understand . Her little hand clasped mine suddenly . She kissed it , Philip , and said oh , so earnestly ! , "
24813	24856	24797	24797	I	0	" This is only one specimen of the quaint things she says so prettily . Poor little soul ! She shall have a stock of white frocks , made with good deep tucks , to let out for her as she grows ' "
24869	24885	24886	24886	she	153	" Did the forlorn woman whom you met in the high - road seem young ? "
24889	24902	24886	24886	she	153	" Young enough to be two- or three - and - twenty ? "
24903	24914	24857	24858	Miss Halcombe	153	" Yes , Miss Halcombe , as young as that . "
24915	24931	24886	24886	she	153	" And she was strangely dressed , from head to foot , all in white ? "
24932	24937	24857	24858	Miss Halcombe	153	" All in white . "
25042	25047	25048	25049	Miss Halcombe	153	" All in white ? "
25052	25181	25048	25049	Miss Halcombe	153	" The most important sentences in the letter , Mr. Hartright , are those at the end , which I will read to you immediately . But I ca n't help dwelling a little upon the coincidence of the white costume of the woman you met , and the white frocks which produced that strange answer from my mother 's little scholar . The doctor may have been wrong when he discovered the child 's defects of intellect , and predicted that she would ' grow out of them . ' She may never have grown out of them , and the old grateful fancy about dressing in white , which was a serious feeling to the girl , may be a serious feeling to the woman still . "
25210	25220	25222	25223	Miss Halcombe	153	" Listen to the last sentences of the letter , "
25225	25233	25222	25223	Miss Halcombe	153	" I think they will surprise you . "
25289	25381	25286	25286	she	153	" ' And now , my love , seeing that I am at the end of my paper , now for the real reason , the surprising reason , for my fondness for little Anne Catherick . My dear Philip , although she is not half so pretty , she is , nevertheless , by one of those extraordinary caprices of accidental resemblance which one sometimes sees , the living likeness , in her hair , her complexion , the colour of her eyes , and the shape of her face ' "
25502	25523	25541	25541	her	153	" was my own recognition of the ominous likeness between the fugitive from the asylum and my pupil at Limmeridge House .
25524	25529	25531	25532	Miss Halcombe	153	" You see it ! "
25549	25564	25534	25534	She	153	" You see it now , as my mother saw it eleven years since ! "
25565	25641	25541	25541	her	153	" I see it more unwillingly than I can say . To associate that forlorn , friendless , lost woman , even by an accidental likeness only , with Miss Fairlie , seems like casting a shadow on the future of the bright creature who stands looking at us now . Let me lose the impression again as soon as possible . Call her in , out of the dreary moonlight pray call her in ! "
25642	25669	25534	25534	She	153	" Mr. Hartright , you surprise me . Whatever women may be , I thought that men , in the nineteenth century , were above superstition . "
25670	25676	25541	25541	her	153	" Pray call her in ! "
25677	25751	25534	25534	She	153	" Hush , hush ! She is coming of her own accord . Say nothing in her presence . Let this discovery of the likeness be kept a secret between you and me . Come in , Laura , come in , and wake Mrs. Vesey with the piano . Mr. Hartright is petitioning for some more music , and he wants it , this time , of the lightest and liveliest kind . "
28410	28416	28417	28417	she	153	" I have been detained , "
28420	28440	28417	28417	she	153	" by a consultation with Mr. Fairlie on a domestic matter which he wished to speak to me about . "
28494	28505	28507	28509	the old lady	431	" I suppose it is the change in the wind , "
28511	28527	28507	28509	the old lady	431	" The winter is coming ah , my love , the winter is coming soon ! "
28610	28621	28622	28622	she	153	" I have seen your uncle this morning , Laura , "
28625	28656	28622	28622	she	153	" He thinks the purple room is the one that ought to be got ready , and he confirms what I told you . Monday is the day not Tuesday . "
28848	28857	28858	28858	she	153	" Have you any leisure time to spare , "
28861	28872	28858	28858	she	153	" before you begin to work in your own room ? "
28873	28887	28940	28943	the under - gardeners	1010	" Certainly , Miss Halcombe . I have always time at your service . "
28888	28928	28858	28858	she	153	" I want to say a word to you in private , Mr. Hartright . Get your hat and come out into the garden . We are not likely to be disturbed there at this hour in the morning . "
28968	28975	28976	28976	she	153	" Is that letter for me ? "
28979	28994	28996	28997	the lad	1013	" Nay , miss ; it 's just said to be for Miss Fairlie , "
29019	29024	29025	29025	she	153	" A strange handwriting , "
29030	29044	29045	29045	she	153	" Who can Laura 's correspondent be ? Where did you get this ? "
29052	29057	29059	29060	the lad	1013	" Well , miss , "
29062	29071	29059	29060	the lad	1013	" I just got it from a woman . "
29072	29076	29012	29012	him	1011	" What woman ? "
29077	29085	29059	29060	the lad	1013	" A woman well stricken in age . "
29086	29098	29012	29012	him	1011	" Oh , an old woman . Any one you knew ? "
29099	29121	29059	29060	the lad	1013	" I canna ' tak ' it on mysel ' to say that she was other than a stranger to me . "
29122	29129	29012	29012	him	1011	" Which way did she go ? "
29130	29134	29136	29139	the under - gardener	1016	" That gate , "
29166	29169	29171	29172	Miss Halcombe	153	" Curious , "
29174	29187	29188	29188	she	153	" I suppose it must be a begging - letter . There , "
29199	29233	29188	29188	she	153	" take it to the house , and give it to one of the servants . And now , Mr. Hartright , if you have no objection , let us walk this way . "
29297	29310	29279	29279	she	153	" What I have to say to you I can say here . "
29365	29369	29370	29370	she	153	" Mr. Hartright , "
29373	29509	29370	29370	she	153	" I am going to begin by making a frank avowal to you . I am going to say without phrase - making , which I detest , or paying compliments , which I heartily despise that I have come , in the course of your residence with us , to feel a strong friendly regard for you . I was predisposed in your favour when you first told me of your conduct towards that unhappy woman whom you met under such remarkable circumstances . Your management of the affair might not have been prudent , but it showed the self - control , the delicacy , and the compassion of a man who was naturally a gentleman . It made me expect good things from you , and you have not disappointed my expectations . "
29589	29594	29595	29595	she	1025	" As your friend , "
29598	29842	29595	29595	she	1025	" I am going to tell you , at once , in my own plain , blunt , downright language , that I have discovered your secret without help or hint , mind , from any one else . Mr. Hartright , you have thoughtlessly allowed yourself to form an attachment a serious and devoted attachment I am afraid to my sister Laura . I do n't put you to the pain of confessing it in so many words , because I see and know that you are too honest to deny it . I do n't even blame you I pity you for opening your heart to a hopeless affection . You have not attempted to take any underhand advantage you have not spoken to my sister in secret . You are guilty of weakness and want of attention to your own best interests , but of nothing worse . If you had acted , in any single respect , less delicately and less modestly , I should have told you to leave the house without an instant 's notice , or an instant 's consultation of anybody . As it is , I blame the misfortune of your years and your position I do n't blame YOU . Shake hands I have given you pain ; I am going to give you more , but there is no help for it shake hands with your friend , Marian Halcombe , first . "
29920	29925	29926	29926	she	1028	" Listen to me , "
29941	30106	29926	29926	she	1028	" Listen to me , and let us get it over at once . It is a real true relief to me that I am not obliged , in what I have now to say , to enter into the question the hard and cruel question as I think it of social inequalities . Circumstances which will try you to the quick , spare me the ungracious necessity of paining a man who has lived in friendly intimacy under the same roof with myself by any humiliating reference to matters of rank and station . You must leave Limmeridge House , Mr. Hartright , before more harm is done . It is my duty to say that to you ; and it would be equally my duty to say it , under precisely the same serious necessity , if you were the representative of the oldest and wealthiest family in England . You must leave us , not because you are a teacher of drawing "
30133	30143	30144	30144	she	1029	" Not because you are a teacher of drawing , "
30147	30158	30144	30144	she	1029	" but because Laura Fairlie is engaged to be married . "
30330	30334	30335	30335	she	153	" Crush it ! "
30338	30371	30335	30335	she	153	" Here , where you first saw her , crush it ! Do n't shrink under it like a woman . Tear it out ; trample it under foot like a man ! "
30451	30457	30432	30432	her	153	" Are you yourself again ? "
30458	30499	30432	30432	her	153	" Enough myself , Miss Halcombe , to ask your pardon and hers . Enough myself to be guided by your advice , and to prove my gratitude in that way , if I can prove it in no other . "
30500	30507	30508	30508	she	153	" You have proved it already , "
30511	30936	30508	30508	she	153	" by those words . Mr. Hartright , concealment is at an end between us . I can not affect to hide from you what my sister has unconsciously shown to me . You must leave us for her sake , as well as for your own . Your presence here , your necessary intimacy with us , harmless as it has been , God knows , in all other respects , has unsteadied her and made her wretched . I , who love her better than my own life I , who have learnt to believe in that pure , noble , innocent nature as I believe in my religion know but too well the secret misery of self - reproach that she has been suffering since the first shadow of a feeling disloyal to her marriage engagement entered her heart in spite of her . I do n't say it would be useless to attempt to say it after what has happened that her engagement has ever had a strong hold on her affections . It is an engagement of honour , not of love ; her father sanctioned it on his deathbed , two years since ; she herself neither welcomed it nor shrank from it she was content to make it . Till you came here she was in the position of hundreds of other women , who marry men without being greatly attracted to them or greatly repelled by them , and who learn to love them when they do n't learn to hate ! after marriage , instead of before . I hope more earnestly than words can say and you should have the self - sacrificing courage to hope too that the new thoughts and feelings which have disturbed the old calmness and the old content have not taken root too deeply to be ever removed . Your absence if I had less belief in your honour , and your courage , and your sense , I should not trust to them as I am trusting now your absence will help my efforts , and time will help us all three . It is something to know that my first confidence in you was not all misplaced . It is something to know that you will not be less honest , less manly , less considerate towards the pupil whose relation to yourself you have had the misfortune to forget , than towards the stranger and the outcast whose appeal to you was not made in vain . "
30982	30998	30999	30999	I	0	" Tell me what apology I can make to Mr. Fairlie for breaking my engagement , "
31002	31025	30999	30999	I	0	" Tell me when to go after that apology is accepted . I promise implicit obedience to you and to your advice . "
31026	31034	31035	31035	she	151	" Time is every way of importance , "
31038	31068	31035	31035	she	151	" You heard me refer this morning to Monday next , and to the necessity of setting the purple room in order . The visitor whom we expect on Monday "
31141	31149	31150	31150	I	0	" Let me go to - day , "
31154	31160	31150	31150	I	0	" The sooner the better . "
31161	31169	31170	31170	she	151	" No , not to - day , "
31173	31359	31170	31170	she	151	" The only reason you can assign to Mr. Fairlie for your departure , before the end of your engagement , must be that an unforeseen necessity compels you to ask his permission to return at once to London . You must wait till to - morrow to tell him that , at the time when the post comes in , because he will then understand the sudden change in your plans , by associating it with the arrival of a letter from London . It is miserable and sickening to descend to deceit , even of the most harmless kind but I know Mr. Fairlie , and if you once excite his suspicions that you are trifling with him , he will refuse to release you . Speak to him on Friday morning : occupy yourself afterwards for the sake of your own interests with your employer in leaving your unfinished work in as little confusion as possible , and quit this place on Saturday . It will be time enough then , Mr. Hartright , for you , and for all of us . "
31491	31503	31505	31506	the girl	8026	" Could I speak to you for a moment , miss ? "
31830	31842	31843	31843	she	153	" We have arranged all that is necessary , Mr. Hartright , "
31846	31932	31843	31843	she	153	" We have understood each other , as friends should , and we may go back at once to the house . To tell you the truth , I am uneasy about Laura . She has sent to say she wants to see me directly , and the maid reports that her mistress is apparently very much agitated by a letter that she has received this morning the same letter , no doubt , which I sent on to the house before we came here . "
32041	32060	32061	32061	I	0	" Now that you are kind enough to tell me we have understood each other , Miss Halcombe , "
32064	32089	32061	32061	I	0	" now that you are sure of my gratitude for your forbearance and my obedience to your wishes , may I venture to ask who "
32115	32125	32126	32126	Her	1066	" who the gentleman engaged to Miss Fairlie is ? "
32149	32158	32141	32141	She	1066	" A gentleman of large property in Hampshire . "
32185	32190	32191	32191	I	0	" And his name ? "
32202	32207	32173	32176	the woman in white	628	" Sir Percival Glyde . "
32272	32277	32278	32278	she	1066	" Sir Percival Glyde , "
32291	32297	32298	32298	I	0	" Knight , or Baronet ? "
32323	32329	32311	32311	She	1066	" Baronet , of course . "
32822	32826	32827	32827	she	153	" Mr. Hartright , "
32830	32901	32827	32827	she	153	" I had hoped that all painful subjects of conversation were exhausted between us , for to - day at least . But it is not to be so . There is some underhand villainy at work to frighten my sister about her approaching marriage . You saw me send the gardener on to the house , with a letter addressed , in a strange handwriting , to Miss Fairlie ? "
32902	32905	32790	32790	Her	153	" Certainly . "
32906	32984	32827	32827	she	153	" The letter is an anonymous letter a vile attempt to injure Sir Percival Glyde in my sister 's estimation . It has so agitated and alarmed her that I have had the greatest possible difficulty in composing her spirits sufficiently to allow me to leave her room and come here . I know this is a family matter on which I ought not to consult you , and in which you can feel no concern or interest "
32985	33013	32790	32790	Her	153	" I beg your pardon , Miss Halcombe . I feel the strongest possible concern and interest in anything that affects Miss Fairlie 's happiness or yours . "
33014	33251	32827	32827	she	153	" I am glad to hear you say so . You are the only person in the house , or out of it , who can advise me . Mr. Fairlie , in his state of health and with his horror of difficulties and mysteries of all kinds , is not to be thought of . The clergyman is a good , weak man , who knows nothing out of the routine of his duties ; and our neighbours are just the sort of comfortable , jog - trot acquaintances whom one can not disturb in times of trouble and danger . What I want to know is this : ought I at once to take such steps as I can to discover the writer of the letter ? or ought I to wait , and apply to Mr. Fairlie 's legal adviser to - morrow ? It is a question perhaps a very important one of gaining or losing a day . Tell me what you think , Mr. Hartright . If necessity had not already obliged me to take you into my confidence under very delicate circumstances , even my helpless situation would , perhaps , be no excuse for me . But as things are I can not surely be wrong , after all that has passed between us , in forgetting that you are a friend of only three months ' standing . "
33271	33327	32790	32790	Her	153	" Do you believe in dreams ? I hope , for your own sake , that you do . See what Scripture says about dreams and their fulfilment Genesis xl . 8 , xli . 25 ; Daniel iv . 18 - 25 , and take the warning I send you before it is too late .
33328	33378	32790	32790	Her	153	" Last night I dreamed about you , Miss Fairlie . I dreamed that I was standing inside the communion rails of a church I on one side of the altar - table , and the clergyman , with his surplice and his prayer - book , on the other .
33379	33445	32790	32790	Her	153	" After a time there walked towards us , down the aisle of the church , a man and a woman , coming to be married . You were the woman . You looked so pretty and innocent in your beautiful white silk dress , and your long white lace veil , that my heart felt for you , and the tears came into my eyes .
33446	33532	32790	32790	Her	153	" They were tears of pity , young lady , that heaven blesses and instead of falling from my eyes like the everyday tears that we all of us shed , they turned into two rays of light which slanted nearer and nearer to the man standing at the altar with you , till they touched his breast . The two rays sprang ill arches like two rainbows between me and him . I looked along them , and I saw down into his inmost heart .
33533	33751	32790	32790	Her	153	" The outside of the man you were marrying was fair enough to see . He was neither tall nor short he was a little below the middle size . A light , active , high - spirited man about five - and - forty years old , to look at . He had a pale face , and was bald over the forehead , but had dark hair on the rest of his head . His beard was shaven on his chin , but was let to grow , of a fine rich brown , on his cheeks and his upper lip . His eyes were brown too , and very bright ; his nose straight and handsome and delicate enough to have done for a woman 's . His hands the same . He was troubled from time to time with a dry hacking cough , and when he put up his white right hand to his mouth , he showed the red scar of an old wound across the back of it . Have I dreamt of the right man ? You know best , Miss Fairlie and you can say if I was deceived or not . Read next , what I saw beneath the outside I entreat you , read , and profit .
33752	33973	32790	32790	Her	153	" I looked along the two rays of light , and I saw down into his inmost heart . It was black as night , and on it were written , in the red flaming letters which are the handwriting of the fallen angel , ' Without pity and without remorse . He has strewn with misery the paths of others , and he will live to strew with misery the path of this woman by his side . ' I read that , and then the rays of light shifted and pointed over his shoulder ; and there , behind him , stood a fiend laughing . And the rays of light shifted once more , and pointed over your shoulder ; and there behind you , stood an angel weeping . And the rays of light shifted for the third time , and pointed straight between you and that man . They widened and widened , thrusting you both asunder , one from the other . And the clergyman looked for the marriage - service in vain : it was gone out of the book , and he shut up the leaves , and put it from him in despair . And I woke with my eyes full of tears and my heart beating for I believe in dreams .
33974	34094	32790	32790	Her	153	" Believe too , Miss Fairlie I beg of you , for your own sake , believe as I do . Joseph and Daniel , and others in Scripture , believed in dreams . Inquire into the past life of that man with the scar on his hand , before you say the words that make you his miserable wife . I do n't give you this warning on my account , but on yours . I have an interest in your well - being that will live as long as I draw breath . Your mother 's daughter has a tender place in my heart for your mother was my first , my best , my only friend . "
34139	34158	32790	32790	Her	153	" It was feeble and faint , and defaced by blots , but had otherwise nothing to distinguish it .
34159	34167	34169	34170	Miss Halcombe	153	" That is not an illiterate letter , "
34172	34233	34169	34170	Miss Halcombe	153	" and at the same time , it is surely too incoherent to be the letter of an educated person in the higher ranks of life . The reference to the bridal dress and veil , and other little expressions , seem to point to it as the production of some woman . What do you think , Mr. Hartright ? "
34234	34262	32790	32790	Her	153	" I think so too . It seems to me to be not only the letter of a woman , but of a woman whose mind must be "
34263	34266	34268	34269	Miss Halcombe	153	" Deranged ? "
34271	34280	34268	34269	Miss Halcombe	153	" It struck me in that light too . "
34302	34328	34268	34269	Miss Halcombe	153	" Your mother 's daughter has a tender place in my heart for your mother was my first , my best , my only friend . "
34471	34486	34487	34487	I	0	" If we have any chance of tracing the person who has written this , "
34497	34583	34487	34487	I	0	" there can be no harm in seizing our opportunity the moment it offers . I think we ought to speak to the gardener again about the elderly woman who gave him the letter , and then to continue our inquiries in the village . But first let me ask a question . You mentioned just now the alternative of consulting Mr. Fairlie 's legal adviser to - morrow . Is there no possibility of communicating with him earlier ? Why not to - day ? "
34584	34590	34592	34593	Miss Halcombe	153	" I can only explain , "
34595	34673	34592	34593	Miss Halcombe	153	" by entering into certain particulars , connected with my sister 's marriage - engagement , which I did not think it necessary or desirable to mention to you this morning . One of Sir Percival Glyde 's objects in coming here on Monday , is to fix the period of his marriage , which has hitherto been left quite unsettled . He is anxious that the event should take place before the end of the year . "
34674	34683	34684	34684	I	0	" Does Miss Fairlie know of that wish ? "
34688	34892	34487	34487	I	0	" She has no suspicion of it , and after what has happened , I shall not take the responsibility upon myself of enlightening her . Sir Percival has only mentioned his views to Mr. Fairlie , who has told me himself that he is ready and anxious , as Laura 's guardian , to forward them . He has written to London , to the family solicitor , Mr. Gilmore . Mr. Gilmore happens to be away in Glasgow on business , and he has replied by proposing to stop at Limmeridge House on his way back to town . He will arrive to - morrow , and will stay with us a few days , so as to allow Sir Percival time to plead his own cause . If he succeeds , Mr. Gilmore will then return to London , taking with him his instructions for my sister 's marriage - settlement . You understand now , Mr. Hartright , why I speak of waiting to take legal advice until to - morrow ? Mr. Gilmore is the old and tried friend of two generations of Fairlies , and we can trust him , as we could trust no one else . "
35083	35092	35093	35093	I	0	" If we are to find out anything , "
35107	35147	35093	35093	I	0	" we had better not let another minute slip by us unemployed . I can only suggest , once more , the propriety of questioning the gardener a second time , and of inquiring in the village immediately afterwards . "
35148	35162	35164	35165	Miss Halcombe	153	" I think I may be of help to you in both cases , "
35169	35188	35164	35165	Miss Halcombe	153	" Let us go , Mr. Hartright , at once , and do the best we can together . "
35219	35229	35230	35230	I	0	" One of the paragraphs of the anonymous letter , "
35233	35262	35230	35230	I	0	" contains some sentences of minute personal description . Sir Percival Glyde 's name is not mentioned , I know but does that description at all resemble him ? "
35263	35275	35322	35322	his	1097	" Accurately even in stating his age to be forty - five "
35342	35345	35346	35347	Miss Halcombe	153	" Accurately , "
35350	35402	35346	35347	Miss Halcombe	153	" even to the scar on his right hand , which is the scar of a wound that he received years since when he was travelling in Italy . There can be no doubt that every peculiarity of his personal appearance is thoroughly well known to the writer of the letter . "
35403	35420	35346	35347	Miss Halcombe	153	" Even a cough that he is troubled with is mentioned , if I remember right ? "
35421	35444	35346	35347	Miss Halcombe	153	" Yes , and mentioned correctly . He treats it lightly himself , though it sometimes makes his friends anxious about him . "
35445	35458	35346	35347	Miss Halcombe	153	" I suppose no whispers have ever been heard against his character ? "
35459	35478	35346	35347	Miss Halcombe	153	" Mr. Hartright ! I hope you are not unjust enough to let that infamous letter influence you ? "
35497	35502	35503	35503	I	0	" I hope not , "
35507	35518	35503	35503	I	0	" Perhaps I had no right to ask the question . "
35519	35528	35529	35529	she	1099	" I am not sorry you asked it , "
35532	35600	35529	35529	she	1099	" for it enables me to do justice to Sir Percival 's reputation . Not a whisper , Mr. Hartright , has ever reached me , or my family , against him . He has fought successfully two contested elections , and has come out of the ordeal unscathed . A man who can do that , in England , is a man whose character is established . "
35920	35934	35936	35937	Miss Halcombe	153	" I am afraid the schoolmaster must have been occupied with his scholars , "
35939	35962	35936	35937	Miss Halcombe	153	" just at the time when the woman passed through the village and returned again . However , we can but try . "
36112	36117	36091	36094	the school - master	1137	" Now , boys , "
36122	36323	36091	36094	the school - master	1137	" mind what I tell you . If I hear another word spoken about ghosts in this school , it will be the worse for all of you . There are no such things as ghosts , and therefore any boy who believes in ghosts believes in what ca n't possibly be ; and a boy who belongs to Limmeridge School , and believes in what ca n't possibly be , sets up his back against reason and discipline , and must be punished accordingly . You all see Jacob Postlethwaite standing up on the stool there in disgrace . He has been punished , not because he said he saw a ghost last night , but because he is too impudent and too obstinate to listen to reason , and because he persists in saying he saw the ghost after I have told him that no such thing can possibly be . If nothing else will do , I mean to cane the ghost out of Jacob Postlethwaite , and if the thing spreads among any of the rest of you , I mean to go a step farther , and cane the ghost out of the whole school . "
36324	36337	36339	36340	Miss Halcombe	153	" We seem to have chosen an awkward moment for our visit , "
36389	36398	36400	36401	the schoolmaster	1124	" Go home all of you to dinner , "
36403	36428	36400	36401	the schoolmaster	1124	" except Jacob . Jacob must stop where he is ; and the ghost may bring him his dinner , if the ghost pleases . "
36508	36521	36523	36524	Miss Halcombe	153	" We came here to ask you a question , Mr. Dempster , "
36530	36555	36523	36524	Miss Halcombe	153	" and we little expected to find you occupied in exorcising a ghost . What does it all mean ? What has really happened ? "
36556	36580	36582	36583	the master	492	" That wicked boy has been frightening the whole school , Miss Halcombe , by declaring that he saw a ghost yesterday evening , "
36585	36606	36582	36583	the master	492	" and he still persists in his absurd story , in spite of all that I can say to him . "
36607	36611	36613	36614	Miss Halcombe	153	" Most extraordinary , "
36615	36686	36687	36687	She	153	" I should not have thought it possible that any of the boys had imagination enough to see a ghost . This is a new accession indeed to the hard labour of forming the youthful mind at Limmeridge , and I heartily wish you well through it , Mr. Dempster . In the meantime , let me explain why you see me here , and what it is I want . "
36734	36747	36749	36750	Miss Halcombe	153	" We may as well return to the house , Mr. Hartright , "
36752	36764	36749	36750	Miss Halcombe	153	" the information we want is evidently not to be found . "
36825	36830	36831	36831	she	153	" You foolish boy , "
36834	36853	36831	36831	she	153	" why do n't you beg Mr. Dempster 's pardon , and hold your tongue about the ghost ? "
36854	36864	36866	36867	Jacob Postlethwaite	176	" Eh ! but I saw t ' ghaist , "
36880	36897	36831	36831	she	153	" Stuff and nonsense ! You saw nothing of the kind . Ghost indeed ! What ghost "
36898	36907	36909	36910	the schoolmaster	1124	" I beg your pardon , Miss Halcombe , "
36914	36944	36909	36910	the schoolmaster	1124	" but I think you had better not question the boy . The obstinate folly of his story is beyond all belief ; and you might lead him into ignorantly "
36945	36949	36951	36952	Miss Halcombe	153	" Ignorantly what ? "
36955	36961	36963	36964	Mr. Dempster	177	" Ignorantly shocking your feelings , "
36971	37001	37002	37002	She	153	" Upon my word , Mr. Dempster , you pay my feelings a great compliment in thinking them weak enough to be shocked by such an urchin as that ! "
37021	37024	37025	37025	she	153	" Come ! "
37028	37048	37025	37025	she	153	" I mean to know all about this . You naughty boy , when did you see the ghost ? "
37049	37056	37058	37058	Jacob	176	" Yestere'en , at the gloaming , "
37060	37079	37025	37025	she	153	" Oh ! you saw it yesterday evening , in the twilight ? And what was it like ? "
37080	37090	37092	37095	the ghost - seer	1154	" Arl in white as a ghaist should be , "
37104	37110	37025	37025	she	153	" And where was it ? "
37111	37126	37025	37025	she	153	" Away yander , in t ' kirkyard where a ghaist ought to be . "
37127	37200	37025	37025	she	153	" As a ' ghaist ' should be where a ' ghaist ' ought to be why , you little fool , you talk as if the manners and customs of ghosts had been familiar to you from your infancy ! You have got your story at your fingers ' ends , at any rate . I suppose I shall hear next that you can actually tell me whose ghost it was ? "
37201	37209	37211	37211	Jacob	176	" Eh ! but I just can , "
37251	37258	37259	37259	he	177	" Excuse me , Miss Halcombe , "
37262	37281	37259	37259	he	177	" if I venture to say that you are only encouraging the boy by asking him these questions . "
37282	37303	37304	37304	she	153	" I will merely ask one more , Mr. Dempster , and then I shall be quite satisfied . Well , "
37312	37319	37304	37304	she	153	" and whose ghost was it ? "
37320	37328	37330	37330	Jacob	176	" T ' ghaist of Mistress Fairlie , "
37404	37409	37410	37410	she	153	" It is useless , "
37413	37495	37410	37410	she	153	" to hold such a child as that responsible for what he says . I have little doubt that the idea has been put into his head by others . If there are people in this village , Mr. Dempster , who have forgotten the respect and gratitude due from every soul in it to my mother 's memory , I will find them out , and if I have any influence with Mr. Fairlie , they shall suffer for it . "
37496	37512	37514	37515	the schoolmaster	1124	" I hope indeed , I am sure , Miss Halcombe that you are mistaken , "
37517	37611	37514	37515	the schoolmaster	1124	" The matter begins and ends with the boy 's own perversity and folly . He saw , or thought he saw , a woman in white , yesterday evening , as he was passing the churchyard ; and the figure , real or fancied , was standing by the marble cross , which he and every one else in Limmeridge knows to be the monument over Mrs. Fairlie 's grave . These two circumstances are surely sufficient to have suggested to the boy himself the answer which has so naturally shocked you ? "
37724	37730	37731	37731	I	0	" A very strong opinion , "
37734	37773	37731	37731	I	0	" the boy 's story , as I believe , has a foundation in fact . I confess I am anxious to see the monument over Mrs. Fairlie 's grave , and to examine the ground about it . "
37774	37781	37708	37709	Miss Halcombe	153	" You shall see the grave . "
37798	37806	37807	37807	she	153	" What has happened in the schoolroom , "
37810	37865	37807	37807	she	153	" has so completely distracted my attention from the subject of the letter , that I feel a little bewildered when I try to return to it . Must we give up all idea of making any further inquiries , and wait to place the thing in Mr. Gilmore 's hands to - morrow ? "
37866	37888	37708	37709	Miss Halcombe	153	" By no means , Miss Halcombe . What has happened in the schoolroom encourages me to persevere in the investigation . "
37889	37896	37807	37807	she	153	" Why does it encourage you ? "
37897	37914	37708	37709	Miss Halcombe	153	" Because it strengthens a suspicion I felt when you gave me the letter to read . "
37915	37936	37807	37807	she	153	" I suppose you had your reasons , Mr. Hartright , for concealing that suspicion from me till this moment ? "
37937	38061	37708	37709	Miss Halcombe	153	" I was afraid to encourage it in myself . I thought it was utterly preposterous I distrusted it as the result of some perversity in my own imagination . But I can do so no longer . Not only the boy 's own answers to your questions , but even a chance expression that dropped from the schoolmaster 's lips in explaining his story , have forced the idea back into my mind . Events may yet prove that idea to be a delusion , Miss Halcombe ; but the belief is strong in me , at this moment , that the fancied ghost in the churchyard , and the writer of the anonymous letter , are one and the same person . "
38076	38080	38062	38062	She	1164	" What person ? "
38081	38111	38062	38062	She	1164	" The schoolmaster unconsciously told you . When he spoke of the figure that the boy saw in the churchyard he called it ' a woman in white . ' "
38112	38117	38062	38062	She	1164	" Not Anne Catherick ? "
38118	38124	38062	38062	She	1164	" Yes , Anne Catherick . "
38138	38145	38146	38146	she	1164	" I do n't know why , "
38152	38172	38173	38173	She	1164	" but there is something in this suspicion of yours that seems to startle and unnerve me . I feel "
38183	38187	38188	38188	she	1164	" Mr. Hartright , "
38192	38230	38188	38188	she	1164	" I will show you the grave , and then go back at once to the house . I had better not leave Laura too long alone . I had better go back and sit with her . "
38400	38409	38411	38412	Miss Halcombe	153	" I need go no farther with you , "
38419	38448	38411	38412	Miss Halcombe	153	" You will let me know if you find anything to confirm the idea you have just mentioned to me . Let us meet again at the house . "
39144	39152	39140	39140	She	153	" I hope it may end well . "
40097	40110	40093	40094	a woman	319	" Do n't you fret , my dear , about the letter , "
40115	40159	40093	40094	a woman	319	" I gave it to the lad quite safe , and the lad he took it from me without a word . He went his way and I went mine , and not a living soul followed me afterwards that I 'll warrant . "
40343	40353	40366	40370	the woman in the shawl	1249	" Mind you keep that comfortable warm cloak on , "
40372	40439	40366	40370	the woman in the shawl	1249	" Mrs. Todd is right about your looking too particular , yesterday , all in white . I 'll walk about a little while you 're here , churchyards being not at all in my way , whatever they may be in yours . Finish what you want to do before I come back , and let us be sure and get home again before night . "
40500	40503	40504	40504	she	1244	" Queer , "
40509	40541	40504	40504	she	1244	" always queer , with her whims and her ways , ever since I can remember her . Harmless , though as harmless , poor soul , as a little child . "
40932	40938	40939	40939	I	0	" Do n't be frightened , "
40942	40948	40939	40939	I	0	" Surely you remember me ? "
41030	41035	41036	41036	I	0	" You remember me ? "
41039	41063	41036	41036	I	0	" We met very late , and I helped you to find the way to London . Surely you have not forgotten that ? "
41100	41111	41112	41112	I	0	" Do n't attempt to speak to me just yet , "
41116	41134	41112	41112	I	0	" Take time to recover yourself take time to feel quite certain that I am a friend . "
41135	41143	41144	41144	she	1247	" You are very kind to me , "
41147	41156	41144	41144	she	1247	" As kind now as you were then . "
41370	41376	41377	41377	I	0	" Are you calmer now ? "
41391	41410	41377	41377	I	0	" Can you talk to me without feeling frightened , and without forgetting that I am a friend ? "
41411	41418	41419	41419	she	1275	" How did you come here ? "
41432	41471	41425	41425	I	0	" Do n't you remember my telling you , when we last met , that I was going to Cumberland ? I have been in Cumberland ever since I have been staying all the time at Limmeridge House . "
41472	41477	41478	41478	Her	1275	" At Limmeridge House ! "
41499	41509	41510	41510	she	1275	" Ah , how happy you must have been ! "
41952	41966	41967	41967	she	151	" You are looking at me , and you are thinking of something , "
41978	41983	41967	41967	she	151	" What is it ? "
41984	41988	41989	41989	I	0	" Nothing extraordinary , "
41992	42002	41989	41989	I	0	" I was only wondering how you came here . "
42003	42024	41971	41971	her	151	" I came with a friend who is very good to me . I have only been here two days . "
42025	42036	41989	41989	I	0	" And you found your way to this place yesterday ? "
42037	42044	41971	41971	her	151	" How do you know that ? "
42045	42051	41989	41989	I	0	" I only guessed it . "
42066	42075	42076	42076	she	151	" Where should I go if not here ? "
42079	42179	42076	42076	she	151	" The friend who was better than a mother to me is the only friend I have to visit at Limmeridge . Oh , it makes my heart ache to see a stain on her tomb ! It ought to be kept white as snow , for her sake . I was tempted to begin cleaning it yesterday , and I ca n't help coming back to go on with it to - day . Is there anything wrong in that ? I hope not . Surely nothing can be wrong that I do for Mrs. Fairlie 's sake ? "
42328	42335	42336	42336	I	0	" Should you wonder very much , "
42355	42392	42336	42336	I	0	" if I owned that it is a satisfaction to me , as well as a surprise , to see you here ? I felt very uneasy about you after you left me in the cab . "
42400	42403	42404	42404	she	151	" Uneasy , "
42407	42410	42404	42404	she	151	" Why ? "
42411	42458	42393	42393	She	151	" A strange thing happened after we parted that night . Two men overtook me in a chaise . They did not see where I was standing , but they stopped near me , and spoke to a policeman on the other side of the way . "
42533	42542	42543	42543	I	0	" The two men spoke to the policeman , "
42546	42580	42543	42543	I	0	" and asked him if he had seen you . He had not seen you ; and then one of the men spoke again , and said you had escaped from his Asylum . "
42599	42607	42608	42608	I	0	" Stop ! and hear the end , "
42611	42669	42608	42608	I	0	" Stop ! and you shall know how I befriended you . A word from me would have told the men which way you had gone and I never spoke that word . I helped your escape I made it safe and certain . Think , try to think . Try to understand what I tell you . "
42768	42785	42786	42786	she	151	" YOU do n't think I ought to be back in the Asylum , do you ? "
42789	42807	42786	42786	she	151	" Certainly not . I am glad you escaped from it I am glad I helped you . "
42808	42827	42828	42828	she	151	" Yes , yes , you did help me indeed ; you helped me at the hard part , "
42835	42903	42828	42828	she	151	" It was easy to escape , or I should not have got away . They never suspected me as they suspected the others . I was so quiet , and so obedient , and so easily frightened . The finding London was the hard part , and there you helped me . Did I thank you at the time ? I thank you now very kindly . "
42904	42934	42935	42935	She	1289	" Was the Asylum far from where you met me ? Come ! show that you believe me to be your friend , and tell me where it was . "
42986	43001	42982	42982	her	1289	" You do n't think I ought to be taken back , do you ? "
43002	43022	43023	43023	I	0	" Once again , I am glad you escaped I am glad you prospered well after you left me , "
43026	43045	43023	43023	I	0	" You said you had a friend in London to go to . Did you find the friend ? "
43046	43104	42982	42982	her	1289	" Yes . It was very late , but there was a girl up at needle - work in the house , and she helped me to rouse Mrs. Clements . Mrs. Clements is my friend . A good , kind woman , but not like Mrs. Fairlie . Ah no , nobody is like Mrs. Fairlie ! "
43105	43123	43023	43023	I	0	" Is Mrs. Clements an old friend of yours ? Have you known her a long time ? "
43124	43260	42982	42982	her	1289	" Yes , she was a neighbour of ours once , at home , in Hampshire , and liked me , and took care of me when I was a little girl . Years ago , when she went away from us , she wrote down in my Prayer - book for me where she was going to live in London , and she said , ' If you are ever in trouble , Anne , come to me . I have no husband alive to say me nay , and no children to look after , and I will take care of you . ' Kind words , were they not ? I suppose I remember them because they were kind . It 's little enough I remember besides little enough , little enough ! "
43261	43274	43023	43023	I	0	" Had you no father or mother to take care of you ? "
43275	43303	42982	42982	her	1289	" Father ? I never saw him I never heard mother speak of him . Father ? Ah , dear ! he is dead , I suppose . "
43304	43309	43023	43023	I	0	" And your mother ? "
43310	43331	42982	42982	her	1289	" I do n't get on well with her . We are a trouble and a fear to each other . "
43369	43377	43378	43378	she	413	" Do n't ask me about mother , "
43382	43441	43378	43378	she	413	" I 'd rather talk of Mrs. Clements . Mrs. Clements is like you , she does n't think that I ought to be back in the Asylum , and she is as glad as you are that I escaped from it . She cried over my misfortune , and said it must be kept secret from everybody . "
43443	43446	43451	43451	she	413	" misfortune . "
43527	43531	43532	43532	I	0	" What misfortune ? "
43535	43544	43545	43545	she	413	" The misfortune of my being shut up , "
43558	43566	43545	43545	she	413	" What other misfortune could there be ? "
43604	43610	43611	43611	I	0	" There is another misfortune , "
43614	43634	43611	43611	I	0	" to which a woman may be liable , and by which she may suffer lifelong sorrow and shame . "
43635	43640	43641	43641	she	413	" What is it ? "
43645	43669	43670	43670	I	0	" The misfortune of believing too innocently in her own virtue , and in the faith and honour of the man she loves , "
43890	43897	43898	43898	she	413	" I do n't understand you , "
43925	43929	43930	43930	I	0	" Never mind , "
43933	43963	43930	43930	I	0	" Let us go on with what we were talking about . Tell me how long you stayed with Mrs. Clements in London , and how you came here . "
43964	43968	43969	43969	she	413	" How long ? "
43972	43990	43969	43969	she	413	" I stayed with Mrs. Clements till we both came to this place , two days ago . "
43991	44001	44002	44002	I	0	" You are living in the village , then ? "
44005	44026	44002	44002	I	0	" It is strange I should not have heard of you , though you have only been here two days . "
44027	44057	44113	44113	she	1309	" No , no , not in the village . Three miles away at a farm . Do you know the farm ? They call it Todd 's Corner . "
44100	44112	44113	44113	she	1309	" They are relations of Mrs. Clements at Todd 's Corner , "
44117	44257	44113	44113	she	1309	" and they had often asked her to go and see them . She said she would go , and take me with her , for the quiet and the fresh air . It was very kind , was it not ? I would have gone anywhere to be quiet , and safe , and out of the way . But when I heard that Todd 's Corner was near Limmeridge oh ! I was so happy I would have walked all the way barefoot to get there , and see the schools and the village and Limmeridge House again . They are very good people at Todd 's Corner . I hope I shall stay there a long time . There is only one thing I do n't like about them , and do n't like about Mrs. Clements "
44258	44263	44376	44376	she	1310	" What is it ? "
44264	44371	44113	44113	she	1309	" They will tease me about dressing all in white they say it looks so particular . How do they know ? Mrs. Fairlie knew best . Mrs. Fairlie would never have made me wear this ugly blue cloak ! Ah ! she was fond of white in her lifetime , and here is white stone about her grave and I am making it whiter for her sake . She often wore white herself , and she always dressed her little daughter in white . Is Miss Fairlie well and happy ? Does she wear white now , as she used when she was a girl ? "
44440	44453	44454	44454	I	0	" Miss Fairlie was not very well or very happy this morning , "
44488	44504	44505	44505	I	0	" Did you ask me why Miss Fairlie was neither well nor happy this morning ? "
44508	44511	44512	44512	she	1310	" No , "
44517	44526	44512	44512	she	1310	" oh no , I never asked that . "
44527	44536	44537	44537	I	0	" I will tell you without your asking , "
44541	44549	44537	44537	I	0	" Miss Fairlie has received your letter . "
44652	44658	44659	44659	she	1310	" How do you know ? "
44663	44670	44659	44659	she	1310	" Who showed it to you ? "
44704	44710	44711	44711	she	1310	" I never wrote it , "
44715	44722	44711	44711	she	1310	" I know nothing about it ! "
44723	44726	44727	44727	I	0	" Yes , "
44730	44796	44727	44727	I	0	" you wrote it , and you know about it . It was wrong to send such a letter , it was wrong to frighten Miss Fairlie . If you had anything to say that it was right and necessary for her to hear , you should have gone yourself to Limmeridge House you should have spoken to the young lady with your own lips . "
44821	44842	44843	44843	I	0	" Miss Fairlie will be as good and kind to you as her mother was , if you mean well , "
44847	44886	44843	44843	I	0	" Miss Fairlie will keep your secret , and not let you come to any harm . Will you see her to - morrow at the farm ? Will you meet her in the garden at Limmeridge House ? "
44887	44904	44905	44905	Her	1310	" Oh , if I could die , and be hidden and at rest with YOU ! "
44931	44978	44905	44905	Her	1310	" You know how I love your child , for your sake ! Oh , Mrs. Fairlie ! Mrs. Fairlie ! tell me how to save her . Be my darling and my mother once more , and tell me what to do for the best . "
45097	45102	45103	45103	I	0	" Come , come , "
45107	45143	45103	45103	I	0	" Try to compose yourself , or you will make me alter my opinion of you . Do n't let me think that the person who put you in the Asylum might have had some excuse "
45305	45311	45312	45312	she	1310	" Talk of something else , "
45320	45331	45312	45312	she	1310	" I shall lose myself if you talk of that . "
45480	45490	45491	45491	I	0	" I will talk of nothing to distress you , "
45495	45500	45501	45501	she	1310	" You want something , "
45507	45525	45501	45501	she	1310	" Do n't look at me like that . Speak to me tell me what you want . "
45526	45549	45580	45580	She	1310	" I only want you to quiet yourself , and when you are calmer , to think over what I have said . "
45550	45553	45554	45554	She	1310	" Said ? "
45572	45579	45554	45554	She	1310	" What is it he said ? "
45592	45600	45601	45601	she	1310	" Why do n't you help me ? "
45608	45613	45614	45614	I	0	" Yes , yes , "
45617	45649	45614	45614	I	0	" I will help you , and you will soon remember . I ask you to see Miss Fairlie to - morrow and to tell her the truth about the letter . "
45650	45657	45588	45588	her	1310	" Ah ! Miss Fairlie Fairlie Fairlie "
45680	45690	45691	45691	I	0	" You need have no fear of Miss Fairlie , "
45694	45763	45691	45691	I	0	" and no fear of getting into trouble through the letter . She knows so much about it already , that you will have no difficulty in telling her all . There can be little necessity for concealment where there is hardly anything left to conceal . You mention no names in the letter ; but Miss Fairlie knows that the person you write of is Sir Percival Glyde "
45929	45938	45921	45921	she	1310	" I 'm coming ! I 'm coming ! "
45960	45965	45966	45966	she	1310	" Who are you ? "
45981	45993	45973	45973	she	1310	" How dare you frighten a poor helpless woman like that ? "
46015	46023	46024	46024	she	1310	" What is it , my dear ? "
46027	46035	46024	46024	she	1310	" What has he done to you ? "
46036	46039	46040	46042	the poor creature	948	" Nothing , "
46045	46053	46040	46042	the poor creature	948	" Nothing . I 'm only frightened . "
46070	46085	46086	46086	I	0	" I should be heartily ashamed of myself if I deserved that angry look , "
46089	46138	46086	46086	I	0	" But I do not deserve it . I have unfortunately startled her without intending it . This is not the first time she has seen me . Ask her yourself , and she will tell you that I am incapable of willingly harming her or any woman . "
46166	46171	46172	46172	she	166	" Yes , yes , "
46174	46184	46185	46185	She	166	" he was good to me once he helped me "
46195	46200	46202	46203	Mrs. Clements	180	" Strange , indeed ! "
46211	46277	46202	46203	Mrs. Clements	180	" It makes all the difference , though . I 'm sorry I spoke so rough to you , sir ; but you must own that appearances looked suspicious to a stranger . It 's more my fault than yours , for humouring her whims , and letting her be alone in such a place as this . Come , my dear come home now . "
46342	46348	46349	46349	I	0	" Try to forgive me , "
46394	46399	46400	46400	she	180	" I will try , "
46403	46419	46400	46400	she	180	" But you know too much I 'm afraid you 'll always frighten me now . "
46432	46439	46440	46440	she	180	" Good - night , sir , "
46443	46466	46440	46440	she	180	" You could n't help it , I know but I wish it was me you had frightened , and not her . "
46493	46498	46499	46499	she	166	" Wait a little , "
46502	46510	46499	46499	she	166	" I must say good - bye . "
46530	46536	46537	46537	she	166	" I 'm better now , "
46546	46551	46537	46537	she	166	" I forgive you . "
46724	46730	46733	46733	she	153	" My mind misgives me , "
46740	46750	46733	46733	she	153	" My mind misgives me sadly about the future . "
46751	46757	46758	46758	I	0	" The future may depend , "
46761	46797	46758	46758	I	0	" on the use we make of the present . It is not improbable that Anne Catherick may speak more readily and unreservedly to a woman than she has spoken to me . If Miss Fairlie "
46798	46808	46814	46814	her	153	" Not to be thought of for a moment , "
46819	46826	46827	46827	I	0	" Let me suggest , then , "
46830	46892	46827	46827	I	0	" that you should see Anne Catherick yourself , and do all you can to win her confidence . For my own part , I shrink from the idea of alarming the poor creature a second time , as I have most unhappily alarmed her already . Do you see any objection to accompanying me to the farmhouse to - morrow ? "
46893	46919	46814	46814	her	153	" None whatever . I will go anywhere and do anything to serve Laura 's interests . What did you say the place was called ? "
46920	46934	46827	46827	I	0	" You must know it well . It is called Todd 's Corner . "
46935	47005	46814	46814	her	153	" Certainly . Todd 's Corner is one of Mr. Fairlie 's farms . Our dairymaid here is the farmer 's second daughter . She goes backwards and forwards constantly between this house and her father 's farm , and she may have heard or seen something which it may be useful to us to know . Shall I ascertain , at once , if the girl is downstairs ? "
47062	47072	47074	47075	Miss Halcombe	153	" I can speak to her to - morrow , "
47086	47128	47078	47079	the servant	368	" In the meantime , let me thoroughly understand the object to be gained by my interview with Anne Catherick . Is there no doubt in your mind that the person who confined her in the Asylum was Sir Percival Glyde ? "
47129	47213	47074	47075	Miss Halcombe	153	" There is not the shadow of a doubt . The only mystery that remains is the mystery of his MOTIVE . Looking to the great difference between his station in life and hers , which seems to preclude all idea of the most distant relationship between them , it is of the last importance even assuming that she really required to be placed under restraint to know why HE should have been the person to assume the serious responsibility of shutting her up "
47214	47225	47078	47079	the servant	368	" In a private Asylum , I think you said ? "
47226	47260	47074	47075	Miss Halcombe	153	" Yes , in a private Asylum , where a sum of money , which no poor person could afford to give , must have been paid for her maintenance as a patient . "
47261	47350	47078	47079	the servant	368	" I see where the doubt lies , Mr. Hartright , and I promise you that it shall be set at rest , whether Anne Catherick assists us to - morrow or not . Sir Percival Glyde shall not be long in this house without satisfying Mr. Gilmore , and satisfying me . My sister 's future is my dearest care in life , and I have influence enough over her to give me some power , where her marriage is concerned , in the disposal of it . "
47729	47731	47723	47724	Mr. Fairlie	143	" possess "
47767	47770	47748	47749	The servant	368	" respects , "
47780	47784	47777	47778	Mr. Fairlie	143	" kind compliments , "
47785	47789	47748	47749	The servant	368	" best thanks , "
47794	47855	47882	47883	Mr. Fairlie	143	" that the state of his health still obliged him to remain a solitary prisoner in his own room . A more satisfactory arrangement to both sides could not possibly have been adopted . It would be hard to say which of us , under the circumstances , felt the most grateful sense of obligation to Mr. Fairlie 's accommodating nerves .
47942	48088	48213	48213	I	0	" Mr. Fairlie 's compliments to Mr. Hartright . Mr. Fairlie is more surprised and disappointed than he can say in the present state of his health by Mr. Hartright 's application . Mr. Fairlie is not a man of business , but he has consulted his steward , who is , and that person confirms Mr. Fairlie 's opinion that Mr. Hartright 's request to be allowed to break his engagement can not be justified by any necessity whatever , excepting perhaps a case of life and death . If the highly - appreciative feeling towards Art and its professors , which it is the consolation and happiness of Mr. Fairlie 's suffering existence to cultivate , could be easily shaken , Mr. Hartright 's present proceeding would have shaken it . It has not done so except in the instance of Mr. Hartright himself .
48089	48212	48213	48213	I	0	" Having stated his opinion so far , that is to say , as acute nervous suffering will allow him to state anything Mr. Fairlie has nothing to add but the expression of his decision , in reference to the highly irregular application that has been made to him . Perfect repose of body and mind being to the last degree important in his case , Mr. Fairlie will not suffer Mr. Hartright to disturb that repose by remaining in the house under circumstances of an essentially irritating nature to both sides . Accordingly , Mr. Fairlie waives his right of refusal , purely with a view to the preservation of his own tranquillity and informs Mr. Hartright that he may go . "
48293	48303	48304	48304	she	153	" Has Mr. Fairlie given you a satisfactory answer ? "
48312	48323	48304	48304	she	153	" He has allowed me to go , Miss Halcombe . "
48574	48583	48584	48584	I	0	" Does Anne Catherick refuse to see you ? "
48589	48595	48597	48598	Miss Halcombe	153	" Anne Catherick is gone , "
48600	48603	48570	48571	Miss Halcombe	153	" Gone ? "
48604	48621	48570	48571	Miss Halcombe	153	" Gone with Mrs. Clements . They both left the farm at eight o'clock this morning . "
48641	48654	48655	48656	Miss Halcombe	153	" All that Mrs. Todd knows about her guests , I know , "
48660	48791	48655	48656	Miss Halcombe	153	" and it leaves me , as it leaves her , in the dark . They both came back safe last night , after they left you , and they passed the first part of the evening with Mr. Todd 's family as usual . Just before supper - time , however , Anne Catherick startled them all by being suddenly seized with faintness . She had had a similar attack , of a less alarming kind , on the day she arrived at the farm ; and Mrs. Todd had connected it , on that occasion , with something she was reading at the time in our local newspaper , which lay on the farm table , and which she had taken up only a minute or two before . "
48792	48809	48810	48810	I	0	" Does Mrs. Todd know what particular passage in the newspaper affected her in that way ? "
48813	48816	48818	48819	Miss Halcombe	153	" No , "
48821	48948	48818	48819	Miss Halcombe	153	" She had looked it over , and had seen nothing in it to agitate any one . I asked leave , however , to look it over in my turn , and at the very first page I opened I found that the editor had enriched his small stock of news by drawing upon our family affairs , and had published my sister 's marriage engagement , among his other announcements , copied from the London papers , of Marriages in High Life . I concluded at once that this was the paragraph which had so strangely affected Anne Catherick , and I thought I saw in it , also , the origin of the letter which she sent to our house the next day . "
48949	48973	48655	48656	Miss Halcombe	153	" There can be no doubt in either case . But what did you hear about her second attack of faintness yesterday evening ? "
48974	49379	48818	48819	Miss Halcombe	153	" Nothing . The cause of it is a complete mystery . There was no stranger in the room . The only visitor was our dairymaid , who , as I told you , is one of Mr. Todd 's daughters , and the only conversation was the usual gossip about local affairs . They heard her cry out , and saw her turn deadly pale , without the slightest apparent reason . Mrs. Todd and Mrs. Clements took her upstairs , and Mrs. Clements remained with her . They were heard talking together until long after the usual bedtime , and early this morning Mrs. Clements took Mrs. Todd aside , and amazed her beyond all power of expression by saying that they must go . The only explanation Mrs. Todd could extract from her guest was , that something had happened , which was not the fault of any one at the farmhouse , but which was serious enough to make Anne Catherick resolve to leave Limmeridge immediately . It was quite useless to press Mrs. Clements to be more explicit . She only shook her head , and said that , for Anne 's sake , she must beg and pray that no one would question her . All she could repeat , with every appearance of being seriously agitated herself , was that Anne must go , that she must go with her , and that the destination to which they might both betake themselves must be kept a secret from everybody . I spare you the recital of Mrs. Todd 's hospitable remonstrances and refusals . It ended in her driving them both to the nearest station , more than three hours since . She tried hard on the way to get them to speak more plainly , but without success ; and she set them down outside the station - door , so hurt and offended by the unceremonious abruptness of their departure and their unfriendly reluctance to place the least confidence in her , that she drove away in anger , without so much as stopping to bid them good - bye . That is exactly what has taken place . Search your own memory , Mr. Hartright , and tell me if anything happened in the burial - ground yesterday evening which can at all account for the extraordinary departure of those two women this morning . "
49380	49453	49564	49565	Miss Halcombe	153	" I should like to account first , Miss Halcombe , for the sudden change in Anne Catherick which alarmed them at the farmhouse , hours after she and I had parted , and when time enough had elapsed to quiet any violent agitation that I might have been unfortunate enough to cause . Did you inquire particularly about the gossip which was going on in the room when she turned faint ? "
49454	49508	48818	48819	Miss Halcombe	153	" Yes . But Mrs. Todd 's household affairs seem to have divided her attention that evening with the talk in the farmhouse parlour . She could only tell me that it was ' just the news , ' meaning , I suppose , that they all talked as usual about each other . "
49509	49522	49523	49523	I	0	" The dairymaid 's memory may be better than her mother 's , "
49526	49550	49523	49523	I	0	" It may be as well for you to speak to the girl , Miss Halcombe , as soon as we get back . "
49606	49619	49621	49622	Miss Halcombe	153	" I have brought this gentleman to see your dairy , Hannah , "
49624	49642	49621	49622	Miss Halcombe	153	" It is one of the sights of the house , and it always does you credit . "
49667	49677	49678	49679	Miss Halcombe	153	" We have just come from your father 's , "
49682	49700	49678	49679	Miss Halcombe	153	" You were there yesterday evening , I hear , and you found visitors at the house ? "
49701	49706	49643	49644	The girl	8026	" Yes , miss . "
49707	49744	49678	49679	Miss Halcombe	153	" One of them was taken faint and ill , I am told . I suppose nothing was said or done to frighten her ? You were not talking of anything very terrible , were you ? "
49745	49751	49753	49754	the girl	8026	" Oh no , miss ! "
49758	49767	49753	49754	the girl	8026	" We were only talking of the news . "
49768	49783	49678	49679	Miss Halcombe	153	" Your sisters told you the news at Todd 's Corner , I suppose ? "
49784	49789	49753	49754	the girl	8026	" Yes , miss . "
49790	49801	49678	49679	Miss Halcombe	153	" And you told them the news at Limmeridge House ? "
49802	49851	49753	49754	the girl	8026	" Yes , miss . And I 'm quite sure nothing was said to frighten the poor thing , for I was talking when she was taken ill . It gave me quite a turn , miss , to see it , never having been taken faint myself . "
49886	49906	49881	49881	I	0	" Ask her if she happened to mention , last night , that visitors were expected at Limmeridge House . "
49933	49943	49945	49946	the girl	8026	" Oh yes , miss , I mentioned that , "
49949	49974	49945	49946	the girl	8026	" The company coming , and the accident to the brindled cow , was all the news I had to take to the farm . "
49975	49994	49917	49917	she	153	" Did you mention names ? Did you tell them that Sir Percival Glyde was expected on Monday ? "
49995	50024	49945	49946	the girl	8026	" Yes , miss I told them Sir Percival Glyde was coming . I hope there was no harm in it I hope I did n't do wrong . "
50025	50057	49917	49917	she	153	" Oh no , no harm . Come , Mr. Hartright , Hannah will begin to think us in the way , if we interrupt her any longer over her work . "
50072	50086	49945	49946	the girl	8026	" Is there any doubt in your mind , NOW , Miss Halcombe ? "
50087	50107	50108	50108	XV	187	" Sir Percival Glyde shall remove that doubt , Mr. Hartright or Laura Fairlie shall never be his wife . "
51375	51386	51388	51390	the old gentleman	1417	" You are the very person I wanted to see , "
51392	51545	51388	51390	the old gentleman	1417	" I had two words to say to you , my dear sir ; and If you have no objection I will avail myself of the present opportunity . To put it plainly , Miss Halcombe and I have been talking over family affairs affairs which are the cause of my being here and in the course of our conversation she was naturally led to tell me of this unpleasant matter connected with the anonymous letter , and of the share which you have most creditably and properly taken in the proceedings so far . That share , I quite understand , gives you an interest which you might not otherwise have felt , in knowing that the future management of the investigation which you have begun will be placed in safe hands . My dear sir , make yourself quite easy on that point it will be placed in MY hands . "
51546	51591	51388	51390	the old gentleman	1417	" You are , in every way , Mr. Gilmore , much fitter to advise and to act in the matter than I am . Is it an indiscretion on my part to ask if you have decided yet on a course of proceeding ? "
51592	51830	51388	51390	the old gentleman	1417	" So far as it is possible to decide , Mr. Hartright , I have decided . I mean to send a copy of the letter , accompanied by a statement of the circumstances , to Sir Percival Glyde 's solicitor in London , with whom I have some acquaintance . The letter itself I shall keep here to show to Sir Percival as soon as he arrives . The tracing of the two women I have already provided for , by sending one of Mr. Fairlie 's servants a confidential person to the station to make inquiries . The man has his money and his directions , and he will follow the women in the event of his finding any clue . This is all that can be done until Sir Percival comes on Monday . I have no doubt myself that every explanation which can be expected from a gentleman and a man of honour , he will readily give . Sir Percival stands very high , sir an eminent position , a reputation above suspicion I feel quite easy about results quite easy , I am rejoiced to assure you . Things of this sort happen constantly in my experience . Anonymous letters unfortunate woman sad state of society . I do n't deny that there are peculiar complications in this case ; but the case itself is , most unhappily , common common . "
51831	51856	51388	51390	the old gentleman	1417	" I am afraid , Mr. Gilmore , I have the misfortune to differ from you in the view I take of the case . "
51857	51994	51388	51390	the old gentleman	1417	" Just so , my dear sir just so . I am an old man , and I take the practical view . You are a young man , and you take the romantic view . Let us not dispute about our views . I live professionally in an atmosphere of disputation , Mr. Hartright , and I am only too glad to escape from it , as I am escaping here . We will wait for events yes , yes , yes we will wait for events . Charming place this . Good shooting ? Probably not , none of Mr. Fairlie 's land is preserved , I think . Charming place , though , and delightful people . You draw and paint , I hear , Mr. Hartright ? Enviable accomplishment . What style ? "
52249	52254	52255	52255	she	153	" No , no , "
52262	52313	52314	52314	she	153	" leave us like a friend break bread with us once more . Stay here and dine , stay here and help us to spend our last evening with you as happily , as like our first evenings , as we can . It is my invitation Mrs. Vesey 's invitation "
52323	52330	52314	52314	she	153	" Laura 's invitation as well . "
52781	52784	52786	52787	Mr. Gilmore	174	" Well , "
52789	52796	52786	52787	Mr. Gilmore	174	" what have you found out ? "
52797	52805	52807	52808	the man	452	" I have found out , sir , "
52810	52824	52807	52808	the man	452	" that both the women took tickets at our station here for Carlisle . "
52825	52839	52786	52787	Mr. Gilmore	174	" You went to Carlisle , of course , when you heard that ? "
52840	52861	52807	52808	the man	452	" I did , sir , but I am sorry to say I could find no further trace of them . "
52862	52869	52786	52787	Mr. Gilmore	174	" You inquired at the railway ? "
52870	52875	52807	52808	the man	452	" Yes , sir . "
52876	52883	52786	52787	Mr. Gilmore	174	" And at the different inns ? "
52884	52889	52807	52808	the man	452	" Yes , sir . "
52890	52905	52786	52787	Mr. Gilmore	174	" And you left the statement I wrote for you at the police station ? "
52906	52912	52807	52808	the man	452	" I did , sir . "
52913	52954	52956	52958	the old gentleman	1417	" Well , my friend , you have done all you could , and I have done all I could , and there the matter must rest till further notice . We have played our trump cards , Mr. Hartright , "
52965	53029	52960	52961	the servant	368	" For the present , at least , the women have outmanoeuvred us , and our only resource now is to wait till Sir Percival Glyde comes here on Monday next . Wo n't you fill your glass again ? Good bottle of port , that sound , substantial , old wine . I have got better in my own cellar , though . "
53247	53267	53268	53268	she	151	" Shall I play some of those little melodies of Mozart 's which you used to like so much ? "
53331	53340	53341	53341	she	151	" Wo n't you take your old place ? "
53353	53363	53364	53364	I	0	" I may take it on the last night , "
53450	53459	53460	53460	she	151	" I am very sorry you are going , "
53505	53526	53482	53482	her	151	" I shall remember those kind words , Miss Fairlie , long after to - morrow has come and gone . "
53544	53553	53554	53554	she	151	" Do n't speak of to - morrow , "
53557	53576	53554	53554	she	151	" Let the music speak to us of to - night , in a happier language than ours . "
53668	53677	53679	53680	Miss Halcombe	153	" You play at whist , Mr. Hartright ? "
53741	53747	53748	53748	she	151	" I WILL play it , "
53757	53767	53748	53748	she	151	" I WILL play it on the last night . "
53768	53774	53776	53777	Miss Halcombe	153	" Come , Mrs. Vesey , "
53779	53798	53776	53777	Miss Halcombe	153	" Mr. Gilmore and I are tired of ecarte come and be Mr. Hartright 's partner at whist . "
54002	54013	54015	54017	the old lady	431	" I shall not see you again , Mr. Hartright , "
54019	54063	54015	54017	the old lady	431	" I am truly sorry you are going away . You have been very kind and attentive , and an old woman like me feels kindness and attention . I wish you happy , sir I wish you a kind good - bye . "
54069	54140	54015	54017	the old lady	431	" I hope we shall have a future opportunity of bettering our acquaintance , Mr. Hartright . You quite understand about that little matter of business being safe in my hands ? Yes , yes , of course . Bless me , how cold it is ! Do n't let me keep you at the door . Bon voyage , my dear sir bon voyage , as the French say . "
54145	54155	54156	54156	she	153	" Half - past seven to - morrow morning , "
54164	54188	54156	54156	she	153	" I have heard and seen more than you think . Your conduct to - night has made me your friend for life . "
54218	54228	54229	54229	I	0	" My departure must be a very early one , "
54232	54243	54229	54229	I	0	" I shall be gone , Miss Fairlie , before you "
54244	54249	54250	54250	she	153	" No , no , "
54254	54287	54250	54250	she	153	" not before I am out of my room . I shall be down to breakfast with Marian . I am not so ungrateful , not so forgetful of the past three months "
54308	54312	54313	54313	she	153	" Good - night "
54447	54451	54453	54454	Miss Halcombe	153	" Better so , "
54461	54471	54485	54485	her	151	" better so , for you and for her . "
54526	54537	54540	54540	I	0	" Have I deserved that you should write to me ? "
54544	54573	54540	54540	I	0	" You have nobly deserved everything that I can do for you , as long as we both live . Whatever the end is you shall know it . "
54574	54605	54624	54624	She	153	" And if I can ever be of help again , at any future time , long after the memory of my presumption and my folly is forgotten . . . "
54674	54702	54703	54703	She	153	" I will trust you if ever the time comes I will trust you as my friend and HER friend , as my brother and HER brother . "
54736	54743	54744	54744	she	153	" God bless you , Walter ! "
54747	54774	54744	54744	she	153	" Wait here alone and compose yourself I had better not stay for both our sakes I had better see you go from the balcony upstairs . "
54960	54970	54971	54971	she	151	" I only went into the drawing - room , "
54974	55017	54971	54971	she	151	" to look for this . It may remind you of your visit here , and of the friends you leave behind you . You told me I had improved very much when I did it , and I thought you might like "
55085	55129	55081	55081	I	0	" It shall never leave me all my life long it shall be the treasure that I prize most . I am very grateful for it very grateful to you , for not letting me go away without bidding you good - bye . "
55130	55133	55134	55134	she	151	" Oh ! "
55138	55156	55134	55134	she	151	" how could I let you go , after we have passed so many happy days together ! "
55157	55238	55081	55081	I	0	" Those days may never return , Miss Fairlie my way of life and yours are very far apart . But if a time should come , when the devotion of my whole heart and soul and strength will give you a moment 's happiness , or spare you a moment 's sorrow , will you try to remember the poor drawing - master who has taught you ? Miss Halcombe has promised to trust me will you promise too ? "
55254	55259	55260	55260	she	151	" I promise it , "
55266	55285	55260	55260	she	151	" Oh , do n't look at me like that ! I promise it with all my heart . "
55300	55341	55286	55286	I	0	" You have many friends who love you , Miss Fairlie . Your happy future is the dear object of many hopes . May I say , at parting , that it is the dear object of MY hopes too ? "
55421	55430	55431	55431	she	151	" For God 's sake , leave me ! "
56517	56519	56512	56512	his	143	" upset "
58123	58138	58139	58139	he	168	" If my plain statement of facts had only been addressed to Mr. Gilmore , "
58142	58296	58139	58139	he	168	" I should consider any further reference to this unhappy matter as unnecessary . I may fairly expect Mr. Gilmore , as a gentleman , to believe me on my word , and when he has done me that justice , all discussion of the subject between us has come to an end . But my position with a lady is not the same . I owe to her what I would concede to no man alive a PROOF of the truth of my assertion . You can not ask for that proof , Miss Halcombe , and it is therefore my duty to you , and still more to Miss Fairlie , to offer it . May I beg that you will write at once to the mother of this unfortunate woman to Mrs. Catherick to ask for her testimony in support of the explanation which I have just offered to you . "
58349	58370	58371	58371	she	153	" I hope , Sir Percival , you do n't do me the injustice to suppose that I distrust you , "
58375	58408	58371	58371	she	153	" Certainly not , Miss Halcombe . I make my proposal purely as an act of attention to YOU . Will you excuse my obstinacy if I still venture to press it ? "
58432	58442	58443	58443	he	168	" Let me beg you to write the note , "
58446	58543	58443	58443	he	168	" as a favour to ME . It need not occupy you more than a few minutes . You have only to ask Mrs. Catherick two questions . First , if her daughter was placed in the Asylum with her knowledge and approval . Secondly , if the share I took in the matter was such as to merit the expression of her gratitude towards myself ? Mr. Gilmore 's mind is at ease on this unpleasant subject , and your mind is at ease pray set my mind at ease also by writing the note . "
58544	58564	58612	58612	He	168	" You oblige me to grant your request , Sir Percival , when I would much rather refuse it . "
58627	58632	58633	58633	he	168	" Come , Nina , "
58636	58646	58633	58633	he	168	" we remember each other , do n't we ? "
58833	58845	58847	58848	Miss Halcombe	153	" You insist on my posting this letter , Sir Percival ? "
58850	58858	58859	58859	he	168	" I beg you will post it , "
58862	58939	58859	58859	he	168	" And now that it is written and sealed up , allow me to ask one or two last questions about the unhappy woman to whom it refers . I have read the communication which Mr. Gilmore kindly addressed to my solicitor , describing the circumstances under which the writer of the anonymous letter was identified . But there are certain points to which that statement does not refer . Did Anne Catherick see Miss Fairlie ? "
58940	58944	58946	58947	Miss Halcombe	153	" Certainly not , "
58949	58955	58859	58859	he	168	" Did she see you ? "
58956	58959	59032	59032	He	1604	" No . "
58960	58985	58859	58859	he	168	" She saw nobody from the house then , except a certain Mr. Hartright , who accidentally met with her in the churchyard here ? "
58986	58990	59032	59032	He	1604	" Nobody else . "
58991	59020	58859	58859	he	168	" Mr. Hartright was employed at Limmeridge as a drawing - master , I believe ? Is he a member of one of the Water - Colour Societies ? "
59021	59027	59029	59030	Miss Halcombe	153	" I believe he is , "
59051	59069	59040	59040	he	1604	" Did you find out where Anne Catherick was living , when she was in this neighbourhood ? "
59070	59085	59040	59040	he	1604	" Yes . At a farm on the moor , called Todd 's Corner . "
59086	59103	59105	59106	Sir Percival	168	" It is a duty we all owe to the poor creature herself to trace her , "
59108	59190	59105	59106	Sir Percival	168	" She may have said something at Todd 's Corner which may help us to find her . I will go there and make inquiries on the chance . In the meantime , as I can not prevail on myself to discuss this painful subject with Miss Fairlie , may I beg , Miss Halcombe , that you will kindly undertake to give her the necessary explanation , deferring it of course until you have received the reply to that note . "
59248	59258	59259	59259	I	0	" A good morning 's work , Miss Halcombe , "
59269	59279	59259	59259	I	0	" Here is an anxious day well ended already . "
59280	59283	59284	59284	she	153	" Yes , "
59287	59300	59284	59284	she	153	" no doubt . I am very glad your mind is satisfied . "
59301	59321	59259	59259	I	0	" My mind ! Surely , with that note in your hand , your mind is at ease too ? "
59322	59339	59340	59340	she	153	" Oh yes how can it be otherwise ? I know the thing could not be , "
59352	59383	59340	59340	she	153	" but I almost wish Walter Hartright had stayed here long enough to be present at the explanation , and to hear the proposal to me to write this note . "
59399	59418	59419	59419	I	0	" Events , it is true , connected Mr. Hartright very remarkably with the affair of the letter , "
59422	59475	59419	59419	I	0	" and I readily admit that he conducted himself , all things considered , with great delicacy and discretion . But I am quite at a loss to understand what useful influence his presence could have exercised in relation to the effect of Sir Percival 's statement on your mind or mine . "
59476	59483	59484	59484	she	153	" It was only a fancy , "
59488	59516	59484	59484	she	153	" There is no need to discuss it , Mr. Gilmore . Your experience ought to be , and is , the best guide I can desire . "
59585	59593	59594	59594	I	0	" If any doubts still trouble you , "
59597	59621	59594	59594	I	0	" why not mention them to me at once ? Tell me plainly , have you any reason to distrust Sir Percival Glyde ? "
59622	59626	59557	59558	Miss Halcombe	153	" None whatever . "
59627	59641	59594	59594	I	0	" Do you see anything improbable , or contradictory , in his explanation ? "
59642	59684	59557	59558	Miss Halcombe	153	" How can I say I do , after the proof he has offered me of the truth of it ? Can there be better testimony in his favour , Mr. Gilmore , than the testimony of the woman 's mother ? "
59685	59722	59594	59594	I	0	" None better . If the answer to your note of inquiry proves to be satisfactory , I for one can not see what more any friend of Sir Percival 's can possibly expect from him . "
59723	59731	59732	59732	she	1609	" Then we will post the note , "
59741	59795	59732	59732	she	1609	" and dismiss all further reference to the subject until the answer arrives . Do n't attach any weight to my hesitation . I can give no better reason for it than that I have been over - anxious about Laura lately and anxiety , Mr. Gilmore , unsettles the strongest of us . "
60360	60440	60488	60488	my	0	" MADAM , I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter , inquiring whether my daughter , Anne , was placed under medical superintendence with my knowledge and approval , and whether the share taken in the matter by Sir Percival Glyde was such as to merit the expression of my gratitude towards that gentleman . Be pleased to accept my answer in the affirmative to both those questions , and believe me to remain , your obedient servant ,
60441	60446	60488	60488	my	0	" JANE ANNE CATHERICK . "
60654	60667	60668	60668	she	153	" I suppose we have really and truly done all we can ? "
60682	60713	60714	60714	I	0	" If we are friends of Sir Percival 's , who know him and trust him , we have done all , and more than all , that is necessary , "
60727	60736	60714	60714	I	0	" But if we are enemies who suspect him "
60737	60748	60749	60749	she	153	" That alternative is not even to be thought of , "
60752	60802	60749	60749	she	153	" We are Sir Percival 's friends , and if generosity and forbearance can add to our regard for him , we ought to be Sir Percival 's admirers as well . You know that he saw Mr. Fairlie yesterday , and that he afterwards went out with me . "
60803	60813	60714	60714	I	0	" Yes . I saw you riding away together . "
60814	61042	60749	60749	she	153	" We began the ride by talking about Anne Catherick , and about the singular manner in which Mr. Hartright met with her . But we soon dropped that subject , and Sir Percival spoke next , in the most unselfish terms , of his engagement with Laura . He said he had observed that she was out of spirits , and he was willing , if not informed to the contrary , to attribute to that cause the alteration in her manner towards him during his present visit . If , however , there was any more serious reason for the change , he would entreat that no constraint might be placed on her inclinations either by Mr. Fairlie or by me . All he asked , in that case , was that she would recall to mind , for the last time , what the circumstances were under which the engagement between them was made , and what his conduct had been from the beginning of the courtship to the present time . If , after due reflection on those two subjects , she seriously desired that he should withdraw his pretensions to the honour of becoming her husband and if she would tell him so plainly with her own lips he would sacrifice himself by leaving her perfectly free to withdraw from the engagement . "
61043	61071	60714	60714	I	0	" No man could say more than that , Miss Halcombe . As to my experience , few men in his situation would have said as much . "
61094	61104	61105	61105	she	1634	" I accuse nobody , and I suspect nothing , "
61110	61128	61105	61105	she	1634	" But I can not and will not accept the responsibility of persuading Laura to this marriage . "
61129	61146	61147	61147	I	0	" That is exactly the course which Sir Percival Glyde has himself requested you to take , "
61152	61163	61147	61147	I	0	" He has begged you not to force her inclinations . "
61164	61181	61105	61105	she	1634	" And he indirectly obliges me to force them , if I give her his message . "
61182	61189	61147	61147	I	0	" How can that possibly be ? "
61190	61291	61105	61105	she	1634	" Consult your own knowledge of Laura , Mr. Gilmore . If I tell her to reflect on the circumstances of her engagement , I at once appeal to two of the strongest feelings in her nature to her love for her father 's memory , and to her strict regard for truth . You know that she never broke a promise in her life you know that she entered on this engagement at the beginning of her father 's fatal illness , and that he spoke hopefully and happily of her marriage to Sir Percival Glyde on his deathbed . "
61307	61310	61311	61311	I	0	" Surely , "
61314	61341	61311	61311	I	0	" you do n't mean to infer that when Sir Percival spoke to you yesterday he speculated on such a result as you have just mentioned ? "
61354	61378	61379	61379	she	1635	" Do you think I would remain an instant in the company of any man whom I suspected of such baseness as that ? "
61411	61416	61417	61417	I	0	" In that case , "
61420	61543	61417	61417	I	0	" excuse me if I tell you , in our legal phrase , that you are travelling out of the record . Whatever the consequences may be , Sir Percival has a right to expect that your sister should carefully consider her engagement from every reasonable point of view before she claims her release from it . If that unlucky letter has prejudiced her against him , go at once , and tell her that he has cleared himself in your eyes and in mine . What objection can she urge against him after that ? What excuse can she possibly have for changing her mind about a man whom she had virtually accepted for her husband more than two years ago ? "
61544	61602	61606	61606	she	1637	" In the eyes of law and reason , Mr. Gilmore , no excuse , I daresay . If she still hesitates , and if I still hesitate , you must attribute our strange conduct , if you like , to caprice in both cases , and we must bear the imputation as well as we can . "
62300	62318	62319	62319	I	0	" You used often to sit on my knee when you were a child , my dear , "
62322	62345	62319	62319	I	0	" and now your little dog seems determined to succeed you in the vacant throne . Is that pretty drawing your doing ? "
62422	62425	62426	62426	she	1652	" No , "
62437	62444	62426	62426	she	1652	" it is not my doing . "
62572	62593	62594	62594	I	0	" One of the errands , my dear , which brings me here is to bid you good - bye , "
62597	62630	62594	62594	I	0	" I must get back to London to - day : and , before I leave , I want to have a word with you on the subject of your own affairs . "
62631	62643	62644	62644	she	1652	" I am very sorry you are going , Mr. Gilmore , "
62652	62664	62644	62644	she	1652	" It is like the happy old times to have you here .
62665	62683	62684	62684	I	0	" I hope I may be able to come back and recall those pleasant memories once more , "
62687	62748	62684	62684	I	0	" but as there is some uncertainty about the future , I must take my opportunity when I can get it , and speak to you now . I am your old lawyer and your old friend , and I may remind you , I am sure , without offence , of the possibility of your marrying Sir Percival Glyde . "
62805	62817	62818	62818	she	1660	" Is it absolutely necessary to speak of my marriage engagement ? "
62824	62833	62834	62834	I	0	" It is necessary to refer to it , "
62837	62956	62834	62834	I	0	" but not to dwell on it . Let us merely say that you may marry , or that you may not marry . In the first case , I must be prepared , beforehand , to draw your settlement , and I ought not to do that without , as a matter of politeness , first consulting you . This may be my only chance of hearing what your wishes are . Let us , therefore , suppose the case of your marrying , and let me inform you , in as few words as possible , what your position is now , and what you may make it , if you please , in the future . "
63052	63056	63057	63057	I	0	" And now , "
63062	63108	63057	63057	I	0	" tell me if you can think of any condition which , in the case we have supposed , you would wish me to make for you subject , of course , to your guardian 's approval , as you are not yet of age . "
63127	63133	63134	63134	she	1660	" If it does happen , "
63138	63142	63134	63134	she	1660	" if I am "
63143	63149	63150	63150	I	0	" If you are married , "
63157	63167	63168	63168	she	1660	" Do n't let him part me from Marian , "
63178	63196	63168	63168	she	1660	" Oh , Mr. Gilmore , pray make it law that Marian is to live with me ! "
63273	63290	63291	63291	I	0	" Your having Marian Halcombe to live with you can easily be settled by private arrangement , "
63294	63340	63291	63291	I	0	" You hardly understood my question , I think . It referred to your own property to the disposal of your money . Supposing you were to make a will when you come of age , who would you like the money to go to ? "
63341	63352	63360	63360	her	1660	" Marian has been mother and sister both to me , "
63369	63380	63360	63360	her	1660	" May I leave it to Marian , Mr. Gilmore ? "
63381	63387	63388	63388	I	0	" Certainly , my love , "
63391	63412	63388	63388	I	0	" But remember what a large sum it is . Would you like it all to go to Miss Halcombe ? "
63433	63439	63440	63440	she	1660	" Not all of it , "
63443	63451	63440	63440	she	1660	" There is some one else besides Marian "
63496	63509	63510	63510	I	0	" You mean some other member of the family besides Miss Halcombe ? "
63547	63554	63555	63555	she	1660	" There is some one else , "
63571	63600	63555	63555	she	1660	" there is some one else who might like a little keepsake if if I might leave it . There would be no harm if I should die first "
63782	63790	63791	63791	I	0	" Do n't cry , my love , "
63852	63861	63862	63862	she	1660	" I am very sorry for forgetting myself , "
63866	63911	63862	63862	she	1660	" I have not been well I have felt sadly weak and nervous lately , and I often cry without reason when I am alone . I am better now I can answer you as I ought , Mr. Gilmore , I can indeed . "
63912	63920	63921	63921	I	0	" No , no , my dear , "
63924	63976	63921	63921	I	0	" we will consider the subject as done with for the present . You have said enough to sanction my taking the best possible care of your interests , and we can settle details at another opportunity . Let us have done with business now , and talk of something else . "
64007	64012	64013	64013	she	1667	" Come here again , "
64017	64041	64013	64013	she	1667	" I will try to be worthier of your kind feeling for me and for my interests if you will only come again . "
64094	64109	64110	64110	I	0	" If I do come again , I hope I shall find you better , "
64113	64125	64110	64110	I	0	" better and happier . God bless you , my dear ! "
64367	64397	64352	64352	He	143	" Kind love and best wishes , dear Gilmore . Hurry of any kind is inexpressibly injurious to me . Pray take care of yourself . Good - bye . "
64411	64421	64422	64422	she	153	" Have you said all you wanted to Laura ? "
64425	64428	64429	64429	I	0	" Yes , "
64432	64451	64429	64429	I	0	" She is very weak and nervous I am glad she has you to take care of her . "
64462	64471	64472	64472	she	153	" You are altering your opinion about Laura , "
64475	64489	64472	64472	she	153	" You are readier to make allowances for her than you were yesterday . "
64511	64528	64508	64508	I	0	" Let me know what happens . I will do nothing till I hear from you . "
64537	64556	64529	64529	She	153	" I wish it was all over , and well over , Mr. Gilmore and so do you . "
64577	64586	64587	64587	he	168	" If you are ever in my neighbourhood , "
64590	64626	64587	64587	he	168	" pray do n't forget that I am sincerely anxious to improve our acquaintance . The tried and trusted old friend of this family will be always a welcome visitor in any house of mine . "
66847	66875	66816	66816	he	1775	" Not admissible . The PRINCIPAL to go to Sir Percival Glyde , in the event of his surviving Lady Glyde , and there being no issue . "
66947	66974	66930	66930	I	0	" My dear sir . Miss Fairlie 's settlement . I maintain the clause to which you object , exactly as it stands . Yours truly . "
66986	67014	66930	66930	I	0	" My dear sir . Miss Fairlie 's settlement . I maintain the red ink to which you object , exactly as it stands . Yours truly . "
67027	67032	66930	66930	I	0	" at a deadlock , "
67281	67398	67399	67399	I	0	" Would dear Gilmore be so very obliging as not to worry his friend and client about such a trifle as a remote contingency ? Was it likely that a young woman of twenty - one would die before a man of forty five , and die without children ? On the other hand , in such a miserable world as this , was it possible to over - estimate the value of peace and quietness ? If those two heavenly blessings were offered in exchange for such an earthly trifle as a remote chance of twenty thousand pounds , was it not a fair bargain ? Surely , yes . Then why not make it ? "
67507	67515	67516	67516	he	195	" And how is good Mr. Gilmore ? "
67531	67597	67516	67516	he	195	" Glad to see you , sir , in such excellent health . I was passing your door , and I thought I would look in in case you might have something to say to me . Do now pray do let us settle this little difference of ours by word of mouth , if we can ! Have you heard from your client yet ? "
67598	67607	67527	67527	his	195	" Yes . Have you heard from yours ? "
67608	67812	67516	67516	he	195	" My dear , good sir ! I wish I had heard from him to any purpose I wish , with all my heart , the responsibility was off my shoulders ; but he is obstinate or let me rather say , resolute and he wo n't take it off . ' Merriman , I leave details to you . Do what you think right for my interests , and consider me as having personally withdrawn from the business until it is all over . ' Those were Sir Percival 's words a fortnight ago , and all I can get him to do now is to repeat them . I am not a hard man , Mr. Gilmore , as you know . Personally and privately , I do assure you , I should like to sponge out that note of mine at this very moment . But if Sir Percival wo n't go into the matter , if Sir Percival will blindly leave all his interests in my sole care , what course can I possibly take except the course of asserting them ? My hands are bound do n't you see , my dear sir ? my hands are bound . "
67813	67828	67829	67829	I	0	" You maintain your note on the clause , then , to the letter ? "
67832	67844	67845	67845	He	1795	" Yes deuce take it ! I have no other alternative . "
67868	67875	67876	67876	he	1795	" What does your side say ? "
67880	67891	67876	67876	he	1795	" now pray tell me what does your side say ? "
67926	67950	67951	67951	I	0	" Twenty thousand pounds is rather a large sum to be given up by the lady 's friends at two days ' notice , "
67954	67958	67960	67961	Mr. Merriman	195	" Very true , "
67970	67979	67960	67961	Mr. Merriman	195	" Properly put , sir most properly put ! "
67980	68012	68013	68013	I	0	" A compromise , recognising the interests of the lady 's family as well as the interests of the husband , might not perhaps have frightened my client quite so much , "
68017	68042	68013	68013	I	0	" Come , come ! this contingency resolves itself into a matter of bargaining after all . What is the least you will take ? "
68043	68050	68052	68053	Mr. Merriman	195	" The least we will take , "
68055	68102	68052	68053	Mr. Merriman	195	" is nineteen- thousand - nine - hundred - and - ninety - nine - pounds - nineteen - shillings- and - elevenpence - three - farthings . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Excuse me , Mr. Gilmore . I must have my little joke . "
68103	68107	68108	68108	I	0	" Little enough , "
68111	68125	68108	68108	I	0	" The joke is just worth the odd farthing it was made for . "
68165	68170	68171	68171	I	0	" This is Friday , "
68174	68185	68171	68171	I	0	" Give us till Tuesday next for our final answer . "
68186	68191	68193	68194	Mr. Merriman	195	" By all means , "
68196	68207	68208	68208	He	195	" Longer , my dear sir , if you like . "
68222	68227	68228	68228	he	195	" By the way , "
68231	68253	68228	68228	he	195	" your clients in Cumberland have not heard anything more of the woman who wrote the anonymous letter , have they ? "
68254	68258	68259	68259	I	0	" Nothing more , "
68262	68271	68259	68259	I	0	" Have you found no trace of her ? "
68272	68276	68278	68280	my legal friend	1797	" Not yet , "
68282	68310	68278	68280	my legal friend	1797	" But we do n't despair . Sir Percival has his suspicions that Somebody is keeping her in hiding , and we are having that Somebody watched . "
68311	68324	68325	68325	I	0	" You mean the old woman who was with her in Cumberland , "
68328	68335	68337	68338	Mr. Merriman	195	" Quite another party , sir , "
68340	68475	68476	68476	He	1798	" We do n't happen to have laid hands on the old woman yet . Our Somebody is a man . We have got him close under our eye here in London , and we strongly suspect he had something to do with helping her in the first instance to escape from the Asylum . Sir Percival wanted to question him at once , but I said , ' No . Questioning him will only put him on his guard watch him , and wait . ' We shall see what happens . A dangerous woman to be at large , Mr. Gilmore ; nobody knows what she may do next . I wish you good - morning , sir . On Tuesday next I shall hope for the pleasure of hearing from you . "
68984	68993	68994	68994	he	133	" Have you been long back from Cumberland ? "
68997	69034	68994	68994	he	133	" I heard from Miss Halcombe lately . I am aware that Sir Percival Glyde 's explanation has been considered satisfactory . Will the marriage take place soon ? Do you happen to know Mr. Gilmore ? "
69109	69117	69118	69118	I	0	" Time will show , Mr. Hartright , "
69120	69169	69118	69118	I	0	" time will show . I dare say if we look out for the marriage in the papers we shall not be far wrong . Excuse my noticing it , but I am sorry to see you not looking so well as you were when we last met . "
69198	69209	69210	69210	he	133	" I had no right to ask about her marriage , "
69214	69230	69231	69231	he	133	" I must wait to see it in the newspapers like other people . Yes , "
69240	69309	69310	69310	He	133	" I have not been well lately . I am going to another country to try a change of scene and occupation . Miss Halcombe has kindly assisted me with her influence , and my testimonials have been found satisfactory . It is a long distance off , but I do n't care where I go , what the climate is , or how long I am away . "
69350	69363	69364	69364	I	0	" I wish you well through it , and safe back again , "
69389	69420	69364	69364	I	0	" I am going down to Limmeridge to - day on business . Miss Halcombe and Miss Fairlie are away just now on a visit to some friends in Yorkshire . "
69861	69870	69872	69873	Mr. Fairlie	143	" You very best of good old friends , "
69885	69908	69879	69879	he	143	" are you QUITE well ? How nice of you to come here and see me in my solitude . Dear Gilmore ! "
69967	69981	69982	69982	I	0	" I have come to speak to you on a very important matter , "
69985	70003	69982	69982	I	0	" and you will therefore excuse me , if I suggest that we had better be alone . "
70021	70026	70012	70013	Mr. Fairlie	143	" better be alone , "
70055	70066	70067	70067	I	0	" Oblige me by giving that man permission to withdraw , "
70089	70092	70093	70093	he	143	" Man ? "
70096	70176	70093	70093	he	143	" You provoking old Gilmore , what can you possibly mean by calling him a man ? He 's nothing of the sort . He might have been a man half an hour ago , before I wanted my etchings , and he may be a man half an hour hence , when I do n't want them any longer . At present he is simply a portfolio stand . Why object , Gilmore , to a portfolio stand ? "
70177	70198	70214	70214	He	1836	" I DO object . For the third time , Mr. Fairlie , I beg that we may be alone . "
70230	70239	70240	70240	he	1836	" Put down the etchings and go away , "
70243	70296	70240	70240	he	1836	" Do n't upset me by losing my place . Have you , or have you not , lost my place ? Are you sure you have not ? And have you put my hand - bell quite within my reach ? Yes ? Then why the devil do n't you go ? "
70353	70363	70364	70364	I	0	" I have come here at great personal inconvenience , "
70367	70397	70364	70364	I	0	" to serve the interests of your niece and your family , and I think I have established some slight claim to be favoured with your attention in return . "
70398	70404	70406	70407	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Do n't bully me ! "
70421	70434	70418	70418	his	143	" Please do n't bully me . I 'm not strong enough . "
70451	70455	70456	70456	I	0	" My object , "
70460	70508	70456	70456	I	0	" is to entreat you to reconsider your letter , and not to force me to abandon the just rights of your niece , and of all who belong to her . Let me state the case to you once more , and for the last time . "
70518	70529	70530	70530	he	143	" This is heartless of you , Gilmore very heartless , "
70533	70540	70530	70530	he	143	" Never mind , go on . "
70607	70611	70612	70612	he	143	" Good Gilmore ! "
70618	70635	70612	70612	he	143	" how very nice this is of you ! How you reconcile one to human nature ! "
70636	70734	70581	70581	he	143	" Give me a plain answer to a plain question , Mr. Fairlie . I tell you again , Sir Percival Glyde has no shadow of a claim to expect more than the income of the money . The money itself if your niece has no children , ought to be under her control , and to return to her family . If you stand firm , Sir Percival must give way he must give way , I tell you , or he exposes himself to the base imputation of marrying Miss Fairlie entirely from mercenary motives . "
70747	70793	70735	70736	Mr. Fairlie	143	" You dear old Gilmore , how you do hate rank and family , do n't you ? How you detest Glyde because he happens to be a baronet . What a Radical you are oh , dear me , what a Radical you are ! "
70850	70857	70859	70860	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Do n't shake the room ! "
70861	70963	70965	70965	he	143	" for Heaven 's sake do n't shake the room ! Worthiest of all possible Gilmores , I meant no offence . My own views are so extremely liberal that I think I am a Radical myself . Yes . We are a pair of Radicals . Please do n't be angry . I ca n't quarrel I have n't stamina enough . Shall we drop the subject ? Yes . Come and look at these sweet etchings . Do let me teach you to understand the heavenly pearliness of these lines . Do now , there 's a good Gilmore ! "
71008	71016	71017	71017	I	0	" You are entirely wrong , sir , "
71020	71188	71017	71017	I	0	" in supposing that I speak from any prejudice against Sir Percival Glyde . I may regret that he has so unreservedly resigned himself in this matter to his lawyer 's direction as to make any appeal to himself impossible , but I am not prejudiced against him . What I have said would equally apply to any other man in his situation , high or low . The principle I maintain is a recognised principle . If you were to apply at the nearest town here , to the first respectable solicitor you could find , he would tell you as a stranger what I tell you as a friend . He would inform you that it is against all rule to abandon the lady 's money entirely to the man she marries . He would decline , on grounds of common legal caution , to give the husband , under any circumstances whatever , an interest of twenty thousand pounds in his wife 's death . "
71189	71196	71198	71199	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Would he really , Gilmore ? "
71201	71232	71198	71199	Mr. Fairlie	143	" If he said anything half so horrid , I do assure you I should tinkle my bell for Louis , and have him sent out of the house immediately . "
71233	71280	71017	71017	I	0	" You shall not irritate me , Mr. Fairlie for your niece 's sake and for her father 's sake , you shall not irritate me . You shall take the whole responsibility of this discreditable settlement on your own shoulders before I leave the room . "
71281	71290	71292	71293	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Do n't ! now please do n't ! "
71295	71390	71292	71293	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Think how precious your time is , Gilmore , and do n't throw it away . I would dispute with you if I could , but I ca n't I have n't stamina enough . You want to upset me , to upset yourself , to upset Glyde , and to upset Laura ; and oh , dear me ! all for the sake of the very last thing in the world that is likely to happen . No , dear friend , in the interests of peace and quietness , positively No ! "
71391	71410	71440	71441	Mr. Fairlie	143	" I am to understand , then , that you hold by the determination expressed in your letter ? "
71411	71430	71292	71293	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Yes , please . So glad we understand each other at last . Sit down again do ! "
71443	71445	71440	71441	Mr. Fairlie	143	" tinkled "
71467	71476	71477	71477	I	0	" Whatever happens in the future , sir , "
71480	71537	71477	71477	I	0	" remember that my plain duty of warning you has been performed . As the faithful friend and servant of your family , I tell you , at parting , that no daughter of mine should be married to any man alive under such a settlement as you are forcing me to make for Miss Fairlie . "
71553	71556	71558	71559	Mr. Fairlie	143	" Louis , "

72192	72197	72198	72198	she	163	" I wanted you , "
72201	72227	72198	72198	she	163	" Come and sit down on the sofa with me . Marian ! I can bear this no longer I must and will end it . "
72300	72314	72315	72315	I	0	" Tell me quietly , my darling , what you wish to do , "
72318	72326	72315	72315	I	0	" Has Mr. Gilmore been advising you ? "
72332	72397	72327	72327	She	163	" No , not in what I am thinking of now . He was very kind and good to me , Marian , and I am ashamed to say I distressed him by crying . I am miserably helpless I ca n't control myself . For my own sake , and for all our sakes , I must have courage enough to end it . "
72398	72409	72410	72410	I	0	" Do you mean courage enough to claim your release ? "
72413	72416	72417	72417	she	163	" No , "
72421	72431	72417	72417	she	163	" Courage , dear , to tell the truth . "
72482	72493	72494	72494	she	163	" I can never claim my release from my engagement , "
72498	72543	72494	72494	she	163	" Whatever way it ends it must end wretchedly for me . All I can do , Marian , is not to add the remembrance that I have broken my promise and forgotten my father 's dying words , to make that wretchedness worse . "
72544	72553	72554	72554	I	0	" What is it you propose , then ? "
72557	72570	72571	72571	she	163	" To tell Sir Percival Glyde the truth with my own lips , "
72574	72598	72571	72571	she	163	" and to let him release me , if he will , not because I ask him , but because he knows all . "
72599	72636	72689	72689	her	1858	" What do you mean , Laura , by ' all ' ? Sir Percival will know enough he has told me so himself if he knows that the engagement is opposed to your own wishes . "
72637	72677	72678	72678	she	1858	" Can I tell him that , when the engagement was made for me by my father , with my own consent ? I should have kept my promise , not happily , I am afraid , but still contentedly "
72694	72730	72678	72678	she	1858	" I should have kept my engagement , Marian , if another love had not grown up in my heart , which was not there when I first promised to be Sir Percival 's wife . "
72731	72746	72678	72678	she	1858	" Laura ! you will never lower yourself by making a confession to him ? "
72747	72772	72678	72678	she	1858	" I shall lower myself , indeed , if I gain my release by hiding from him what he has a right to know . "
72773	72786	72678	72678	she	1858	" He has not the shadow of a right to know it ! "
72787	72819	72820	72820	She	1859	" Wrong , Marian , wrong ! I ought to deceive no one least of all the man to whom my father gave me , and to whom I gave myself . "
72831	72836	72837	72837	she	1859	" My own love , "
72841	72918	72837	72837	she	1859	" you are so much too fond of me , and so much too proud of me , that you forget , in my case , what you would remember in your own . Better that Sir Percival should doubt my motives , and misjudge my conduct if he will , than that I should be first false to him in thought , and then mean enough to serve my own interests by hiding the falsehood . "
73036	73046	73047	73047	she	1859	" Do n't be angry with me , Marian , "
73110	73123	73124	73124	she	1859	" I have thought of this , love , for many days , "
73156	73270	73124	73124	she	1859	" I have thought of it very seriously , and I can be sure of my courage when my own conscience tells me I am right . Let me speak to him to - morrow in your presence , Marian . I will say nothing that is wrong , nothing that you or I need be ashamed of but , oh , it will ease my heart so to end this miserable concealment ! Only let me know and feel that I have no deception to answer for on my side , and then , when he has heard what I have to say , let him act towards me as he will . "
73652	73660	73661	73661	she	163	" Leave it there to - night , "
73664	73685	73661	73661	she	163	" to - morrow may be cruel , and may make me say good - bye to it for ever . "
74149	74159	74162	74162	she	163	" Do n't be afraid of me , Marian , "
74165	74197	74162	74162	she	163	" I may forget myself with an old friend like Mr. Gilmore , or with a dear sister like you , but I will not forget myself with Sir Percival Glyde . "
74416	74427	74428	74428	she	163	" I wish to speak to you , Sir Percival , "
74431	74499	74428	74428	she	163	" on a subject that is very important to us both . My sister is here , because her presence helps me and gives me confidence . She has not suggested one word of what I am going to say I speak from my own thoughts , not from hers . I am sure you will be kind enough to understand that before I go any farther ? "
74548	74555	74556	74556	she	163	" I have heard from Marian , "
74560	74636	74556	74556	she	163	" that I have only to claim my release from our engagement to obtain that release from you . It was forbearing and generous on your part , Sir Percival , to send me such a message . It is only doing you justice to say that I am grateful for the offer , and I hope and believe that it is only doing myself justice to tell you that I decline to accept it . "
74677	74683	74684	74684	she	163	" I have not forgotten , "
74687	74833	74684	74684	she	163	" that you asked my father 's permission before you honoured me with a proposal of marriage . Perhaps you have not forgotten either what I said when I consented to our engagement ? I ventured to tell you that my father 's influence and advice had mainly decided me to give you my promise . I was guided by my father , because I had always found him the truest of all advisers , the best and fondest of all protectors and friends . I have lost him now I have only his memory to love , but my faith in that dear dead friend has never been shaken . I believe at this moment , as truly as I ever believed , that he knew what was best , and that his hopes and wishes ought to be my hopes and wishes too . "
74874	74879	74880	74880	he	168	" May I ask , "
74883	74908	74880	74880	he	168	" if I have ever proved myself unworthy of the trust which it has been hitherto my greatest honour and greatest happiness to possess ? "
74909	74920	74921	74921	she	1890	" I have found nothing in your conduct to blame , "
74924	75076	74921	74921	she	1890	" You have always treated me with the same delicacy and the same forbearance . You have deserved my trust , and , what is of far more importance in my estimation , you have deserved my father 's trust , out of which mine grew . You have given me no excuse , even if I had wanted to find one , for asking to be released from my pledge . What I have said so far has been spoken with the wish to acknowledge my whole obligation to you . My regard for that obligation , my regard for my father 's memory , and my regard for my own promise , all forbid me to set the example , on my side , of withdrawing from our present position . The breaking of our engagement must be entirely your wish and your act , Sir Percival not mine . "
75095	75099	75100	75100	he	1891	" My act ? "
75103	75115	75100	75100	he	1891	" What reason can there be on my side for withdrawing ? "
75154	75166	75167	75167	she	1892	" A reason that it is very hard to tell you , "
75170	75202	75167	75167	she	1892	" There is a change in me , Sir Percival a change which is serious enough to justify you , to yourself and to me , in breaking off our engagement . "
75253	75257	75258	75258	he	1891	" What change ? "
75341	75346	75347	75347	she	1892	" I have heard , "
75350	75424	75347	75347	she	1892	" and I believe it , that the fondest and truest of all affections is the affection which a woman ought to bear to her husband . When our engagement began that affection was mine to give , if I could , and yours to win , if you could . Will you pardon me , and spare me , Sir Percival , if I acknowledge that it is not so any longer ? "
75585	75589	75590	75590	I	0	" Sir Percival ! "
75594	75614	75615	75615	I	0	" have you nothing to say when my sister has said so much ? More , in my opinion , "
75627	75645	75615	75615	I	0	" than any man alive , in your position , has a right to hear from her . "
75672	75679	75680	75680	he	168	" Pardon me , Miss Halcombe , "
75691	75706	75680	75680	he	168	" pardon me if I remind you that I have claimed no such right . "
75739	75752	75753	75753	she	163	" I hope I have not made my painful acknowledgment in vain , "
75756	75774	75753	75753	she	163	" I hope it has secured me your entire confidence in what I have still to say ? "
75775	75782	75783	75783	He	168	" Pray be assured of it . "
75837	75853	75854	75854	she	163	" I wish you to understand that I have not spoken from any selfish motive , "
75857	75923	75854	75854	she	163	" If you leave me , Sir Percival , after what you have just heard , you do not leave me to marry another man , you only allow me to remain a single woman for the rest of my life . My fault towards you has begun and ended in my own thoughts . It can never go any farther . No word has passed "
75953	75959	75960	75960	she	163	" No word has passed , "
75966	76096	75960	75960	she	163	" between myself and the person to whom I am now referring for the first and last time in your presence of my feelings towards him , or of his feelings towards me no word ever can pass neither he nor I are likely , in this world , to meet again . I earnestly beg you to spare me from saying any more , and to believe me , on my word , in what I have just told you . It is the truth . Sir Percival , the truth which I think my promised husband has a claim to hear , at any sacrifice of my own feelings . I trust to his generosity to pardon me , and to his honour to keep my secret . "
76097	76106	76107	76107	he	1896	" Both those trusts are sacred to me , "
76110	76118	76107	76107	he	1896	" and both shall be sacredly kept . "
76140	76150	76151	76151	she	1897	" I have said all I wish to say , "
76154	76170	76151	76151	she	1897	" I have said more than enough to justify you in withdrawing from your engagement . "
76171	76179	76180	76180	he	1896	" You have said more than enough , "
76183	76198	76180	76180	he	1896	" to make it the dearest object of my life to KEEP the engagement . "
76342	76357	76358	76358	he	168	" You have left it to ME , Miss Fairlie , to resign you , "
76361	76384	76358	76358	he	168	" I am not heartless enough to resign a woman who has just shown herself to be the noblest of her sex . "
76426	76429	76430	76430	she	1897	" No ! "
76434	76457	76430	76430	she	1897	" The most wretched of her sex , if she must give herself in marriage when she can not give her love . "
76458	76468	76469	76469	he	168	" May she not give it in the future , "
76472	76487	76469	76469	he	168	" if the one object of her husband 's life is to deserve it ? "
76488	76491	76492	76492	she	1897	" Never ! "
76495	76529	76492	76492	she	1897	" If you still persist in maintaining our engagement , I may be your true and faithful wife , Sir Percival your loving wife , if I know my own heart , never ! "
76582	76591	76592	76592	he	168	" I gratefully accept your faith and truth , "
76595	76622	76592	76592	he	168	" The least that you can offer is more to me than the utmost that I could hope for from any other woman in the world . "
76789	76802	76803	76803	she	1897	" I must submit , Marian , as well as I can , "
76806	76824	76803	76803	she	1897	" My new life has its hard duties , and one of them begins to - day . "
76873	76885	76886	76886	she	1897	" I must part from everything that reminds me of him , "
76889	76903	76886	76886	she	1897	" Keep the key wherever you please I shall never want it again . "
76958	76965	76966	76966	I	0	" Oh , Laura ! Laura ! "
76990	76999	77000	77000	she	1897	" It is the last time , Marian , "
77003	77014	77000	77000	she	1897	" I am bidding it good - bye for ever . "
77110	77121	77122	77122	she	1897	" You write to him and he writes to you , "
77125	77237	77122	77122	she	1897	" While I am alive , if he asks after me always tell him I am well , and never say I am unhappy . Do n't distress him , Marian , for my sake , do n't distress him . If I die first , promise you will give him this little book of his drawings , with my hair in it . There can be no harm , when I am gone , in telling him that I put it there with my own hands . And say oh , Marian , say for me , then , what I can never say for myself say I loved him ! "
77530	77537	77538	77538	she	1903	" I left yesterday to decide , "
77541	77555	77538	77538	she	1903	" and yesterday HAS decided . It is too late to go back . "

78746	78775	78743	78743	she	163	" I have caused trouble and anxiety enough to you , and to all about me . Let me cause no more , Marian let Sir Percival decide . "
78789	78797	78798	78798	she	163	" I am held to my engagement , "
78801	78852	78798	78798	she	163	" I have broken with my old life . The evil day will not come the less surely because I put it off . No , Marian ! once again my uncle is right . I have caused trouble enough and anxiety enough , and I will cause no more . "
79411	79437	79407	79407	she	163	" I will go anywhere with you , Marian . I dare say you are right I dare say the change will do me good . "

80533	80538	80539	80539	I	0	" Let me go ! "
80542	80565	80522	80522	she	163	" My tongue burns to tell your uncle that he and Sir Percival are not to have it all their own way . "
80576	80579	80580	80580	she	163	" No ! "
80584	80593	80580	80580	she	163	" Too late , Marian , too late ! "
80594	80601	80602	80602	I	0	" Not a minute too late , "
80605	80629	80602	80602	I	0	" The question of time is OUR question and trust me , Laura , to take a woman 's full advantage of it . "
80663	80676	80677	80677	she	163	" It will only involve us in more trouble and more confusion , "
80680	80702	80677	80677	she	163	" It will set you and my uncle at variance , and bring Sir Percival here again with fresh causes of complaint "
80703	80709	80710	80710	I	0	" So much the better ! "
80715	80826	80710	80710	I	0	" Who cares for his causes of complaint ? Are you to break your heart to set his mind at ease ? No man under heaven deserves these sacrifices from us women . Men ! They are the enemies of our innocence and our peace they drag us away from our parents ' love and our sisters ' friendship they take us body and soul to themselves , and fasten our helpless lives to theirs as they chain up a dog to his kennel . And what does the best of them give us in return ? Let me go , Laura I 'm mad when I think of it ! "
80879	80884	80885	80885	she	1968	" Oh , Marian ! "
80888	80974	80885	80885	she	1968	" You crying ! Think what you would say to me , if the places were changed , and if those tears were mine . All your love and courage and devotion will not alter what must happen , sooner or later . Let my uncle have his way . Let us have no more troubles and heart - burnings that any sacrifice of mine can prevent . Say you will live with me , Marian , when I am married and say no more . "
81052	81059	81060	81060	she	1968	" While we were at Polesdean , "
81063	81070	81060	81060	she	1968	" you had a letter , Marian "

92578	92594	92572	92572	she	2364	" It 's Baxter 's doings and Baxter 's dooty that 's what it is . "
92633	92640	92642	92643	the housekeeper	1357	" Why , Lord bless me , "
92645	92654	92642	92643	the housekeeper	1357	" that must be Mrs. Catherick 's dog ! "
92655	92658	92659	92659	I	0	" Whose ? "
92667	92682	92620	92620	she	1357	" Mrs. Catherick 's . You seem to know Mrs. Catherick , Miss Halcombe ? "
92683	92708	92642	92643	the housekeeper	1357	" Not personally , but I have heard of her . Does she live here ? Has she had any news of her daughter ? "
92709	92723	92620	92620	she	1357	" No , Miss Halcombe , she came here to ask for news . "
92724	92727	92642	92643	the housekeeper	1357	" When ? "
92728	92834	92620	92620	she	1357	" Only yesterday . She said some one had reported that a stranger answering to the description of her daughter had been seen in our neighbourhood . No such report has reached us here , and no such report was known in the village , when I sent to make inquiries there on Mrs. Catherick 's account . She certainly brought this poor little dog with her when she came , and I saw it trot out after her when she went away . I suppose the creature strayed into the plantations , and got shot . Where did you find it , Miss Halcombe ? "
92835	92847	92642	92643	the housekeeper	1357	" In the old shed that looks out on the lake . "
92848	92925	92620	92620	she	1357	" Ah , yes , that is the plantation side , and the poor thing dragged itself , I suppose , to the nearest shelter , as dogs will , to die . If you can moisten its lips with the milk , Miss Halcombe , I will wash the clotted hair from the wound . I am very much afraid it is too late to do any good . However , we can but try . "
92973	92998	92962	92963	Walter Hartright	133	" If ever Anne Catherick crosses your path , make better use of the opportunity , Miss Halcombe , than I made of it . "
93060	93073	93074	93074	I	0	" Did you say that Mrs. Catherick lived anywhere in this neighbourhood ? "
93077	93083	93085	93086	the housekeeper	1357	" Oh dear , no , "
93088	93113	93085	93086	the housekeeper	1357	" She lives at Welmingham , quite at the other end of the county five - and - twenty miles off , at least . "
93114	93126	93085	93086	the housekeeper	1357	" I suppose you have known Mrs. Catherick for some years ? "
93127	93225	93085	93086	the housekeeper	1357	" On the contrary , Miss Halcombe , I never saw her before she came here yesterday . I had heard of her , of course , because I had heard of Sir Percival 's kindness in putting her daughter under medical care . Mrs. Catherick is rather a strange person in her manners , but extremely respectable - looking . She seemed sorely put out when she found that there was no foundation none , at least , that any of us could discover for the report of her daughter having been seen in this neighbourhood . "
93226	93235	93236	93236	I	0	" I am rather interested about Mrs. Catherick , "
93248	93271	93236	93236	I	0	" I wish I had arrived here soon enough to see her yesterday . Did she stay for any length of time ? "
93272	93275	93277	93278	the housekeeper	1357	" Yes , "
93386	93386	93367	93367	I	0	"
93443	93446	93447	93447	I	0	" Probably , "
93467	93504	93458	93458	my	0	" probably she thought the announcement of her visit might vex Sir Percival to no purpose , by reminding him that her lost daughter was not found yet . Did she talk much on that subject ? "
93505	93509	93511	93512	the housekeeper	1357	" Very little , "
93514	93658	93511	93512	the housekeeper	1357	" She talked principally of Sir Percival , and asked a great many questions about where he had been travelling , and what sort of lady his new wife was . She seemed to be more soured and put out than distressed , by failing to find any traces of her daughter in these parts . ' I give her up , ' were the last words she said that I can remember ; ' I give her up , ma'am , for lost . ' And from that she passed at once to her questions about Lady Glyde , wanting to know if she was a handsome , amiable lady , comely and healthy and young Ah , dear ! I thought how it would end . Look , Miss Halcombe , the poor thing is out of its misery at last ! "
93690	93697	93700	93701	the housekeeper	1357	" comely and healthy and young , "
94880	94890	94891	94891	she	163	" Whenever you and I are together , Marian , "
94894	94939	94940	94940	she	163	" we shall both be happier and easier with one another , if we accept my married life for what it is , and say and think as little about it as possible . I would tell you everything , darling , about myself , "
94954	95054	94940	94940	she	163	" if my confidences could only end there . But they could not they would lead me into confidences about my husband too ; and now I am married , I think I had better avoid them , for his sake , and for your sake , and for mine . I do n't say that they would distress you , or distress me I would n't have you think that for the world . But I want to be so happy , now I have got you back again , and I want you to be so happy too "
95078	95081	95082	95082	she	2421	" Ah ! "
95095	95246	95247	95247	she	2425	" another old friend found already ! Your book - case , Marian your dear - little - shabby - old - satin - wood book - case how glad I am you brought it with you from Limmeridge ! And the horrid heavy man 's umbrella , that you always would walk out with when it rained ! And first and foremost of all , your own dear , dark , clever , gipsy - face , looking at me just as usual ! It is so like home again to be here . How can we make it more like home still ? I will put my father 's portrait in your room instead of in mine and I will keep all my little treasures from Limmeridge here and we will pass hours and hours every day with these four friendly walls round us . Oh , Marian ! "
95268	95321	95247	95247	she	2425	" promise you will never marry , and leave me . It is selfish to say so , but you are so much better off as a single woman unless unless you are very fond of your husband but you wo n't be very fond of anybody but me , will you ? "
95340	95354	95355	95355	she	2425	" Have you been writing many letters , and receiving many letters lately ? "
95389	95396	95397	95397	she	2425	" Have you heard from him ? "
95427	95449	95422	95422	her	2425	" Is he well and happy , and getting on in his profession ? Has he recovered himself and forgotten me ? "
96081	96096	96097	96097	He	168	" How - d'ye - do , Miss Halcombe glad to see you again . "
98764	98768	98760	98760	he	215	" go upstairs , "
99267	99274	99276	99277	the groom	2551	" Mind that dog , sir , "
99279	99285	99276	99277	the groom	2551	" he flies at everybody ! "
99286	99294	99296	99297	the Count	2074	" He does that , my friend , "
99300	99317	99296	99297	the Count	2074	" because everybody is afraid of him . Let us see if he flies at me . "
99357	99365	99366	99366	he	2074	" You big dogs are all cowards , "
99388	99505	99506	99506	He	2554	" You would kill a poor cat , you infernal coward . You would fly at a starving beggar , you infernal coward . Anything that you can surprise unawares anything that is afraid of your big body , and your wicked white teeth , and your slobbering , bloodthirsty mouth , is the thing you like to fly at . You could throttle me at this moment , you mean , miserable bully , and you dare n't so much as look me in the face , because I 'm not afraid of you . Will you think better of it , and try your teeth in my fat neck ? Bah ! not you ! "
99531	99538	99539	99539	he	2554	" Ah ! my nice waistcoat ! "
99543	99565	99539	99539	he	2554	" I am sorry I came here . Some of that brute 's slobber has got on my pretty clean waistcoat . "
99800	99804	99805	99805	he	2554	" my angel , "
100021	100034	100009	100009	he	2554	" My good Percival ! how I like your rough English humour ! "
100035	100048	100049	100049	He	2554	" My good Percival ! how I enjoy your solid English sense ! "
100666	100683	100658	100659	the servant	368	" Mr. Merriman has just come , Sir Percival , and wishes to see you immediately . "
100700	100704	100705	100705	he	452	" Mr. Merriman ! "
100720	100731	100710	100710	he	452	" Yes , Sir Percival Mr. Merriman , from London . "
100732	100737	100710	100710	he	452	" Where is he ? "
100738	100746	100710	100710	he	452	" In the library , Sir Percival . "
100774	100780	100782	100782	Laura	163	" Who is Mr. Merriman ? "
100788	100796	100799	100799	I	0	" I have not the least idea , "
100841	100850	100851	100851	he	2074	" Mr. Merriman is Sir Percival 's solicitor , "
101117	101120	101121	101121	he	195	" Yes , "
101149	101159	101121	101121	he	195	" yes , Miss Halcombe , something HAS happened . "
101168	101174	101160	101160	I	0	" I never said so , "
101404	101413	101416	101417	the lawyer	2627	" Make your mind easy , Sir Percival , "
101420	101428	101416	101417	the lawyer	2627	" it all rests with Lady Glyde . "
101556	101564	101565	101566	the lawyer	2627	" You quite understand , Sir Percival , "
101570	101646	101565	101566	the lawyer	2627	" Lady Glyde is to sign her name in the presence of a witness or of two witnesses , if you wish to be particularly careful and is then to put her finger on the seal and say , ' I deliver this as my act and deed . ' If that is done in a week 's time the arrangement will be perfectly successful , and the anxiety will be all over . If not "
101647	101658	101660	101661	Sir Percival	195	" What do you mean by ' if not ' ? "
101664	101683	101660	101661	Sir Percival	195	" If the thing must be done it SHALL be done . I promise you that , Merriman . "
101684	101758	101565	101566	the lawyer	2627	" Just so , Sir Percival just so ; but there are two alternatives in all transactions , and we lawyers like to look both of them in the face boldly . If through any extraordinary circumstance the arrangement should not be made , I think I may be able to get the parties to accept bills at three months . But how the money is to be raised when the bills fall due "
101759	101802	101660	101661	Sir Percival	195	" Damn the bills ! The money is only to be got in one way , and in that way , I tell you again , it SHALL be got . Take a glass of wine , Merriman , before you go . "
101803	101849	101565	101566	the lawyer	2627	" Much obliged , Sir Percival , I have not a moment to lose if I am to catch the up - train . You will let me know as soon as the arrangement is complete ? and you will not forget the caution I recommended "
101850	101920	101925	101926	the baronet	7784	" Of course I wo n't . There 's the dog - cart at the door for you . My groom will get you to the station in no time . Benjamin , drive like mad ! Jump in . If Mr. Merriman misses the train you lose your place . Hold fast , Merriman , and if you are upset trust to the devil to save his own . "
101961	101963	102059	102059	She	2635	" that "
101966	102046	102059	102059	She	2635	" was but too plainly a serious money embarrassment , and Sir Percival 's relief from it depended upon Laura . The prospect of seeing her involved in her husband 's secret difficulties filled me with dismay , exaggerated , no doubt , by my ignorance of business and my settled distrust of Sir Percival . Instead of going out , as I proposed , I went back immediately to Laura 's room to tell her what I had heard .
102082	102088	102089	102089	she	2635	" I feared as much , "
102092	102110	102089	102089	she	2635	" when I heard of that strange gentleman who called , and declined to leave his name . "
102111	102122	102123	102123	I	0	" Who do you think the gentleman was , then ? "
102126	102137	102138	102138	she	2635	" Some person who has heavy claims on Sir Percival , "
102141	102158	102138	102138	she	2635	" and who has been the cause of Mr. Merriman 's visit here to - day . "
102159	102168	102089	102089	she	2635	" Do you know anything about those claims ? "
102169	102177	102138	102138	she	2635	" No , I know no particulars . "
102178	102192	102089	102089	she	2635	" You will sign nothing , Laura , without first looking at it ? "
102193	102280	102138	102138	she	2635	" Certainly not , Marian . Whatever I can harmlessly and honestly do to help him I will do for the sake of making your life and mine , love , as easy and as happy as possible . But I will do nothing ignorantly , which we might , one day , have reason to feel ashamed of . Let us say no more about it now . You have got your hat on suppose we go and dream away the afternoon in the grounds ? "
102481	102494	102496	102497	the Count	2074	" Figaro qua ! Figaro la ! Figaro su ! Figaro giu ! "
102536	102555	102556	102556	I	0	" Take my word for it , Laura , that man knows something of Sir Percival 's embarrassments , "
102571	102578	102579	102579	she	2647	" What makes you think that ? "
102582	102600	102601	102601	I	0	" How should he have known , otherwise , that Mr. Merriman was Sir Percival 's solicitor ? "
102604	102648	102601	102601	I	0	" Besides , when I followed you out of the luncheon - room , he told me , without a single word of inquiry on my part , that something had happened . Depend upon it , he knows more than we do . "
102649	102668	102556	102556	I	0	" Do n't ask him any questions if he does . Do n't take him into our confidence ! "
102669	102694	102601	102601	I	0	" You seem to dislike him , Laura , in a very determined manner . What has he said or done to justify you ? "
102695	102778	102556	102556	I	0	" Nothing , Marian . On the contrary , he was all kindness and attention on our journey home , and he several times checked Sir Percival 's outbreaks of temper , in the most considerate manner towards me . Perhaps I dislike him because he has so much more power over my husband than I have . Perhaps it hurts my pride to be under any obligations to his interference . All I know is , that I DO dislike him . "
103019	103021	103006	103006	he	195	" arrangement "
103074	103083	103084	103084	I	0	" We expect to see him here directly , "
103087	103092	103093	103094	Sir Percival	195	" The fact is , "
103104	103134	103135	103135	He	195	" I want Fosco and his wife in the library , for a mere business formality , and I want you there , Laura , for a minute too . "
103156	103163	103164	103164	he	195	" Have you just come in ? "
103167	103175	103164	103164	he	195	" or were you just going out ? "
103176	103189	103191	103191	Laura	163	" We were all thinking of going to the lake this morning , "
103193	103203	103191	103191	Laura	163	" But if you have any other arrangement to propose "
103204	103209	103210	103210	he	195	" No , no , "
103214	103258	103210	103210	he	195	" My arrangement can wait . After lunch will do as well for it as after breakfast . All going to the lake , eh ? A good idea . Let 's have an idle morning I 'll be one of the party . "
103422	103428	103430	103431	the Count	2074	" With your kind permission , "
103433	103486	103430	103431	the Count	2074	" I will take my small family here my poor - little - harmless - pretty - Mouseys , out for an airing along with us . There are dogs about the house , and shall I leave my forlorn white children at the mercies of the dogs ? Ah , never ! "
103942	103949	103951	103952	Sir Percival	195	" Some people call that picturesque , "
103968	104073	103960	103960	his	195	" I call it a blot on a gentleman 's property . In my great - grandfather 's time the lake flowed to this place . Look at it now ! It is not four feet deep anywhere , and it is all puddles and pools . I wish I could afford to drain it , and plant it all over . My bailiff a superstitious idiot says he is quite sure the lake has a curse on it , like the Dead Sea . What do you think , Fosco ? It looks just the place for a murder , does n't it ? "
104074	104079	104081	104082	the Count	2074	" My good Percival , "
104084	104139	104081	104082	the Count	2074	" What is your solid English sense thinking of ? The water is too shallow to hide the body , and there is sand everywhere to print off the murderer 's footsteps . It is , upon the whole , the very worst place for a murder that I ever set my eyes on . "
104140	104143	104145	104146	Sir Percival	195	" Humbug ! "
104155	104197	104145	104146	Sir Percival	195	" You know what I mean . The dreary scenery , the lonely situation . If you choose to understand me , you can if you do n't choose , I am not going to trouble myself to explain my meaning . "
104198	104203	104205	104206	the Count	2074	" And why not , "
104208	104296	104205	104206	the Count	2074	" when your meaning can be explained by anybody in two words ? If a fool was going to commit a murder , your lake is the first place he would choose for it . If a wise man was going to commit a murder , your lake is the last place he would choose for it . Is that your meaning ? If it is , there is your explanation for you ready made . Take it , Percival , with your good Fosco 's blessing . "
104330	104351	104352	104352	she	163	" I am sorry to hear the lake - view connected with anything so horrible as the idea of murder , "
104355	104436	104352	104352	she	163	" And if Count Fosco must divide murderers into classes , I think he has been very unfortunate in his choice of expressions . To describe them as fools only seems like treating them with an indulgence to which they have no claim . And to describe them as wise men sounds to me like a downright contradiction in terms . I have always heard that truly wise men are truly good men , and have a horror of crime . "
104437	104442	104444	104445	the Count	2074	" My dear lady , "
104447	104467	104468	104468	He	2074	" those are admirable sentiments , and I have seen them stated at the tops of copy - books . "
104491	104499	104500	104500	he	2074	" My pretty little smooth white rascal , "
104503	104549	104500	104500	he	2074	" here is a moral lesson for you . A truly wise mouse is a truly good mouse . Mention that , if you please , to your companions , and never gnaw at the bars of your cage again as long as you live . "
104550	104560	104562	104562	Laura	163	" It is easy to turn everything into ridicule , "
104565	104595	104562	104562	Laura	163	" but you will not find it quite so easy , Count Fosco , to give me an instance of a wise man who has been a great criminal . "
104612	104616	104617	104617	he	2074	" Most true ! "
104620	104695	104617	104617	he	2074	" The fool 's crime is the crime that is found out , and the wise man 's crime is the crime that is NOT found out . If I could give you an instance , it would not be the instance of a wise man . Dear Lady Glyde , your sound English common sense has been too much for me . It is checkmate for me this time , Miss Halcombe ha ? "
104696	104704	104706	104707	Sir Percival	195	" Stand to your guns , Laura , "
104720	104756	104706	104707	Sir Percival	195	" Tell him next , that crimes cause their own detection . There 's another bit of copy - book morality for you , Fosco . Crimes cause their own detection . What infernal humbug ! "
104757	104765	104767	104767	Laura	163	" I believe it to be true , "
104796	104802	104803	104803	I	0	" I believe it too , "
104850	104855	104857	104858	Count Fosco	193	" Poor dear Percival ! "
104865	104903	104904	104904	he	193	" he is the victim of English spleen . But , my dear Miss Halcombe , my dear Lady Glyde , do you really believe that crimes cause their own detection ? And you , my angel , "
104920	104927	104904	104904	he	193	" do you think so too ? "
104928	104935	104937	104938	the Countess	2468	" I wait to be instructed , "
104952	104969	104937	104938	the Countess	2468	" before I venture on giving my opinion in the presence of well - informed men . "
104970	104976	104977	104977	I	0	" Do you , indeed ? "
104980	105006	104977	104977	I	0	" I remember the time , Countess , when you advocated the Rights of Women , and freedom of female opinion was one of them . "
105007	105018	105020	105021	Madame Fosco	194	" What is your view of the subject , Count ? "
105056	105062	105063	105063	he	2074	" It is truly wonderful , "
105066	105397	105063	105063	he	2074	" how easily Society can console itself for the worst of its shortcomings with a little bit of clap - trap . The machinery it has set up for the detection of crime is miserably ineffective and yet only invent a moral epigram , saying that it works well , and you blind everybody to its blunders from that moment . Crimes cause their own detection , do they ? And murder will out another moral epigram , will it ? Ask Coroners who sit at inquests in large towns if that is true , Lady Glyde . Ask secretaries of life - assurance companies if that is true , Miss Halcombe . Read your own public journals . In the few cases that get into the newspapers , are there not instances of slain bodies found , and no murderers ever discovered ? Multiply the cases that are reported by the cases that are NOT reported , and the bodies that are found by the bodies that are NOT found , and what conclusion do you come to ? This . That there are foolish criminals who are discovered , and wise criminals who escape . The hiding of a crime , or the detection of a crime , what is it ? A trial of skill between the police on one side , and the individual on the other . When the criminal is a brutal , ignorant fool , the police in nine cases out of ten win . When the criminal is a resolute , educated , highly - intelligent man , the police in nine cases out of ten lose . If the police win , you generally hear all about it . If the police lose , you generally hear nothing . And on this tottering foundation you build up your comfortable moral maxim that Crime causes its own detection ! Yes all the crime you know of . And what of the rest ? "
105398	105407	105420	105421	Sir Percival	195	" Devilish true , and very well put , "
105439	105447	105448	105448	I	0	" Some of it may be true , "
105451	105500	105448	105448	I	0	" and all of it may be very well put . But I do n't see why Count Fosco should celebrate the victory of the criminal over Society with so much exultation , or why you , Sir Percival , should applaud him so loudly for doing it . "
105501	105509	105511	105512	Sir Percival	195	" Do you hear that , Fosco ? "
105514	105543	105511	105512	Sir Percival	195	" Take my advice , and make your peace with your audience . Tell them virtue 's a fine thing they like that , I can promise you . "
105585	105599	105600	105600	he	2074	" The ladies , my good Percival , shall tell me about virtue , "
105603	105624	105600	105600	he	2074	" They are better authorities than I am , for they know what virtue is , and I do n't . "
105625	105630	105632	105633	Sir Percival	195	" You hear him ? "
105635	105641	105632	105633	Sir Percival	195	" Is n't it awful ? "
105642	105647	105649	105650	the Count	2074	" It is true , "
105653	105847	105649	105650	the Count	2074	" I am a citizen of the world , and I have met , in my time , with so many different sorts of virtue , that I am puzzled , in my old age , to say which is the right sort and which is the wrong . Here , in England , there is one virtue . And there , in China , there is another virtue . And John Englishman says my virtue is the genuine virtue . And John Chinaman says my virtue is the genuine virtue . And I say Yes to one , or No to the other , and am just as much bewildered about it in the case of John with the top - boots as I am in the case of John with the pigtail . Ah , nice little Mousey ! come , kiss me . What is your own private notion of a virtuous man , my pret - pret - pretty ? A man who keeps you warm , and gives you plenty to eat . And a good notion , too , for it is intelligible , at the least . "
105848	105855	105856	105856	I	0	" Stay a minute , Count , "
105859	105918	105856	105856	I	0	" Accepting your illustration , surely we have one unquestionable virtue in England which is wanting in China . The Chinese authorities kill thousands of innocent people on the most frivolous pretexts . We in England are free from all guilt of that kind we commit no such dreadful crime we abhor reckless bloodshed with all our hearts . "
105919	105925	105927	105927	Laura	163	" Quite right , Marian , "
105929	105938	105927	105927	Laura	163	" Well thought of , and well expressed . "
105939	105947	105949	105950	Madame Fosco	194	" Pray allow the Count to proceed , "
105956	105978	105949	105950	Madame Fosco	194	" You will find , young ladies , that HE never speaks without having excellent reasons for all that he says . "
105979	105986	105988	105989	the Count	2074	" Thank you , my angel , "
105991	105998	105988	105989	the Count	2074	" Have a bon - bon ? "
106019	106025	106027	106029	the impenetrable man	2707	" Chocolat a la Vanille , "
106044	106058	106027	106029	the impenetrable man	2707	" Offered by Fosco as an act of homage to the charming society . "
106059	106069	106071	106072	his wife	8436	" Be good enough to go on , Count , "
106081	106089	106071	106072	his wife	8436	" Oblige me by answering Miss Halcombe . "
106090	106096	106098	106100	the polite Italian	2709	" Miss Halcombe is unanswerable , "
106102	106859	106098	106100	the polite Italian	2709	" that is to say , so far as she goes . Yes ! I agree with her . John Bull does abhor the crimes of John Chinaman . He is the quickest old gentleman at finding out faults that are his neighbours ' , and the slowest old gentleman at finding out the faults that are his own , who exists on the face of creation . Is he so very much better in this way than the people whom he condemns in their way ? English Society , Miss Halcombe , is as often the accomplice as it is the enemy of crime . Yes ! yes ! Crime is in this country what crime is in other countries a good friend to a man and to those about him as often as it is an enemy . A great rascal provides for his wife and family . The worse he is the more he makes them the objects for your sympathy . He often provides also for himself . A profligate spendthrift who is always borrowing money will get more from his friends than the rigidly honest man who only borrows of them once , under pressure of the direst want . In the one case the friends will not be at all surprised , and they will give . In the other case they will be very much surprised , and they will hesitate . Is the prison that Mr. Scoundrel lives in at the end of his career a more uncomfortable place than the workhouse that Mr. Honesty lives in at the end of his career ? When John - Howard - Philanthropist wants to relieve misery he goes to find it in prisons , where crime is wretched not in huts and hovels , where virtue is wretched too . Who is the English poet who has won the most universal sympathy who makes the easiest of all subjects for pathetic writing and pathetic painting ? That nice young person who began life with a forgery , and ended it by a suicide your dear , romantic , interesting Chatterton . Which gets on best , do you think , of two poor starving dressmakers the woman who resists temptation and is honest , or the woman who falls under temptation and steals ? You all know that the stealing is the making of that second woman 's fortune it advertises her from length to breadth of good - humoured , charitable England and she is relieved , as the breaker of a commandment , when she would have been left to starve , as the keeper of it . Come here , my jolly little Mouse ! Hey ! presto ! pass ! I transform you , for the time being , into a respectable lady . Stop there , in the palm of my great big hand , my dear , and listen . You marry the poor man whom you love , Mouse , and one half your friends pity , and the other half blame you . And now , on the contrary , you sell yourself for gold to a man you do n't care for , and all your friends rejoice over you , and a minister of public worship sanctions the base horror of the vilest of all human bargains , and smiles and smirks afterwards at your table , if you are polite enough to ask him to breakfast . Hey ! presto ! pass ! Be a mouse again , and squeak . If you continue to be a lady much longer , I shall have you telling me that Society abhors crime and then , Mouse , I shall doubt if your own eyes and ears are really of any use to you . Ah ! I am a bad man , Lady Glyde , am I not ? I say what other people only think , and when all the rest of the world is in a conspiracy to accept the mask for the true face , mine is the rash hand that tears off the plump pasteboard , and shows the bare bones beneath . I will get up on my big elephant 's legs , before I do myself any more harm in your amiable estimations I will get up and take a little airy walk of my own . Dear ladies , as your excellent Sheridan said , I go and leave my character behind me . "
106883	106893	106894	106894	he	2710	" One , two , three , four Ha ! "
106903	106931	106894	106894	he	2710	" where , in the name of Heaven , is the fifth the youngest , the whitest , the most amiable of all my Benjamin of mice ! "
107132	107135	107136	107136	he	2074	" Percival ! "
107143	107149	107136	107136	he	2074	" Percival ! come here . "
107191	107198	107199	107199	he	2074	" What 's the matter now ? "
107210	107217	107219	107220	the Count	2074	" Do you see nothing there ? "
107248	107256	107258	107259	Sir Percival	195	" I see plenty of dry sand , "
107261	107273	107258	107259	Sir Percival	195	" and a spot of dirt in the middle of it . "
107274	107278	107280	107281	the Count	2074	" Not dirt , "
107301	107304	107298	107298	his	2074	" Blood . "
107331	107337	107338	107338	I	0	" Nonsense , my dear , "
107341	107362	107338	107338	I	0	" There is no need to be alarmed . It is only the blood of a poor little stray dog . "
107377	107384	107386	107387	Sir Percival	195	" How do you know that ? "
107392	107411	107412	107412	I	0	" I found the dog here , dying , on the day when you all returned from abroad , "
107415	107433	107412	107412	I	0	" The poor creature had strayed into the plantation , and had been shot by your keeper . "
107434	107440	107442	107443	Sir Percival	195	" Whose dog was it ? "
107445	107451	107442	107443	Sir Percival	195	" Not one of mine ? "
107452	107462	107464	107464	Laura	163	" Did you try to save the poor thing ? "
107467	107477	107464	107464	Laura	163	" Surely you tried to save it , Marian ? "
107478	107481	107482	107482	I	0	" Yes , "
107485	107508	107482	107482	I	0	" the housekeeper and I both did our best but the dog was mortally wounded , and he died under our hands . "
107509	107515	107517	107518	Sir Percival	195	" Whose dog was it ? "
107527	107532	107521	107521	his	195	" One of mine ? "
107533	107541	107482	107482	I	0	" No , not one of yours . "
107542	107551	107521	107521	his	195	" Whose then ? Did the housekeeper know ? "
107646	107649	107650	107650	I	0	" Yes , "
107653	107668	107650	107650	I	0	" The housekeeper knew . She told me it was Mrs. Catherick 's dog . "
107726	107740	107741	107741	he	195	" How came the housekeeper to know it was Mrs. Catherick 's dog ? "
107764	107769	107770	107770	I	0	" She knew it , "
107774	107784	107770	107770	I	0	" because Mrs. Catherick brought the dog with her . "
107785	107799	107823	107823	he	195	" Brought it with her ? Where did she bring it with her ? "
107800	107805	107770	107770	I	0	" To this house . "
107806	107818	107823	107823	he	195	" What the devil did Mrs. Catherick want at this house ? "
107883	107891	107873	107874	the Count	2074	" My dear Percival ! gently gently ! "
107911	107919	107901	107902	The Count	2074	" Gently , my good friend gently ! "
107942	107951	107952	107952	he	2074	" I beg your pardon , Miss Halcombe , "
107955	108003	107952	107952	he	2074	" I have been out of order lately , and I am afraid I am a little irritable . But I should like to know what Mrs. Catherick could possibly want here . When did she come ? Was the housekeeper the only person who saw her ? "
108004	108009	108010	108010	I	0	" The only person , "
108020	108020	108010	108010	I	0	"
108026	108036	108037	108037	he	2074	" In that case why not question the housekeeper ? "
108040	108057	108037	108037	he	2074	" Why not go , Percival , to the fountain - head of information at once ? "
108058	108062	108064	108065	Sir Percival	195	" Quite right ! "
108067	108089	108064	108065	Sir Percival	195	" Of course the housekeeper is the first person to question . Excessively stupid of me not to see it myself . "
108557	108565	108567	108568	the Count	2074	" A fine horse , my friend , "
108581	108589	108567	108568	the Count	2074	" You are going to drive out ? "
108590	108598	108600	108601	the man	452	" I am not going , sir , "
108623	108629	108600	108601	the man	452	" My master drives himself . "
108630	108633	108635	108636	the Count	2074	" Aha ! "
108638	108681	108635	108636	the Count	2074	" does he indeed ? I wonder he gives himself the trouble when he has got you to drive for him . Is he going to fatigue that nice , shining , pretty horse by taking him very far to - day ? "
108682	108690	108692	108693	the man	452	" I do n't know , sir , "
108695	108750	108692	108693	the man	452	" The horse is a mare , if you please , sir . She 's the highest - couraged thing we 've got in the stables . Her name 's Brown Molly , sir , and she 'll go till she drops . Sir Percival usually takes Isaac of York for the short distances . "
108751	108762	108772	108773	the Count	2074	" And your shining courageous Brown Molly for the long ? "
108763	108770	108772	108773	the Count	2074	" Logical inference , Miss Halcombe , "
108783	108795	108772	108773	the Count	2074	" Sir Percival is going a long distance to - day . "
108944	108957	108958	108958	he	195	" I am sorry to say I am obliged to leave you , "
108960	109063	108958	108958	he	195	" a long drive a matter that I ca n't very well put off . I shall be back in good time to - morrow but before I go I should like that little business - formality , which I spoke of this morning , to be settled . Laura , will you come into the library ? It wo n't take a minute a mere formality . Countess , may I trouble you also ? I want you and the Countess , Fosco , to be witnesses to a signature nothing more . Come in at once and get it over . "
109154	109164	109165	109165	he	195	" I must beg you to come downstairs again , "
109168	109210	109165	109165	he	195	" It is Fosco 's fault , Miss Halcombe , not mine . He has started some nonsensical objection to his wife being one of the witnesses , and has obliged me to ask you to join us in the library . "
109298	109306	109307	109307	he	2074	" A thousand pardons , Miss Halcombe , "
109310	109421	109307	109307	he	2074	" You know the character which is given to my countrymen by the English ? We Italians are all wily and suspicious by nature , in the estimation of the good John Bull . Set me down , if you please , as being no better than the rest of my race . I am a wily Italian and a suspicious Italian . You have thought so yourself , dear lady , have you not ? Well ! it is part of my wiliness and part of my suspicion to object to Madame Fosco being a witness to Lady Glyde 's signature , when I am also a witness myself . "
109422	109435	109437	109438	Sir Percival	195	" There is not the shadow of a reason for his objection , "
109440	109464	109437	109438	Sir Percival	195	" I have explained to him that the law of England allows Madame Fosco to witness a signature as well as her husband . "
109465	109470	109472	109473	the Count	2074	" I admit it , "
109475	109493	109494	109494	He	2074	" The law of England says , Yes , but the conscience of Fosco says , No . "
109534	109548	109549	109549	he	2074	" What this document which Lady Glyde is about to sign may be , "
109552	109759	109549	109549	he	2074	" I neither know nor desire to know . I only say this , circumstances may happen in the future which may oblige Percival , or his representatives , to appeal to the two witnesses , in which case it is certainly desirable that those witnesses should represent two opinions which are perfectly independent the one of the other . This can not be if my wife signs as well as myself , because we have but one opinion between us , and that opinion is mine . I will not have it cast in my teeth , at some future day , that Madame Fosco acted under my coercion , and was , in plain fact , no witness at all . I speak in Percival 's interest , when I propose that my name shall appear as the nearest friend of the husband , and your name , Miss Halcombe as the nearest friend of the wife . I am a Jesuit , if you please to think so a splitter of straws a man of trifles and crochets and scruples but you will humour me , I hope , in merciful consideration for my suspicious Italian character , and my uneasy Italian conscience . "
109863	109872	109873	109873	I	0	" I will readily remain in the room , "
109876	109901	109873	109873	I	0	" And if I find no reason for starting any small scruples on my side , you may rely on me as a witness . "
109954	109960	109962	109963	Sir Percival	195	" You need n't go , "
110156	110162	110163	110163	he	195	" Sign your name there , "
110171	110212	110163	110163	he	195	" You and Fosco are to sign afterwards , Miss Halcombe , opposite those two wafers . Come here , Fosco ! witnessing a signature is not to be done by mooning out of window and smoking into the flowers . "
110332	110336	110337	110337	he	195	" Sign there , "
110356	110365	110366	110366	she	163	" What is it I am to sign ? "
110370	110378	110379	110379	he	195	" I have no time to explain , "
110382	110447	110379	110379	he	195	" The dog - cart is at the door , and I must go directly . Besides , if I had time , you would n't understand . It is a purely formal document , full of legal technicalities , and all that sort of thing . Come ! come ! sign your name , and let us have done as soon as possible . "
110448	110468	110337	110337	he	195	" I ought surely to know what I am signing , Sir Percival , before I write my name ? "
110469	110491	110379	110379	he	195	" Nonsense ! What have women to do with business ? I tell you again , you ca n't understand it . "
110492	110527	110337	110337	he	195	" At any rate , let me try to understand it . Whenever Mr. Gilmore had any business for me to do , he always explained it first , and I always understood him . "
110528	110601	110379	110379	he	195	" I dare say he did . He was your servant , and was obliged to explain . I am your husband , and am NOT obliged . How much longer do you mean to keep me here ? I tell you again , there is no time for reading anything the dog - cart is waiting at the door . Once for all , will you sign or will you not ? "
110623	110632	110633	110633	she	2791	" If my signature pledges me to anything , "
110649	110649	110633	110633	she	2791	"
110664	110668	110669	110669	he	2792	" Speak out ! "
110672	110700	110669	110669	he	2792	" You were always famous for telling the truth . Never mind Miss Halcombe , never mind Fosco say , in plain terms , you distrust me . "
110738	110746	110747	110747	he	2074	" Control your unfortunate temper , Percival , "
110749	110755	110747	110747	he	2074	" Lady Glyde is right . "
110756	110759	110761	110762	Sir Percival	195	" Right ! "
110764	110773	110761	110762	Sir Percival	195	" A wife right in distrusting her husband ! "
110774	110787	110789	110789	Laura	163	" It is unjust and cruel to accuse me of distrusting you , "
110791	110814	110789	110789	Laura	163	" Ask Marian if I am not justified in wanting to know what this writing requires of me before I sign it . "
110815	110827	110829	110830	Sir Percival	195	" I wo n't have any appeals made to Miss Halcombe , "
110832	110843	110829	110830	Sir Percival	195	" Miss Halcombe has nothing to do with the matter . "
110910	110917	110918	110918	I	0	" Excuse me , Sir Percival , "
110920	110988	110918	110918	I	0	" but as one of the witnesses to the signature , I venture to think that I HAVE something to do with the matter . Laura 's objection seems to me a perfectly fair one , and speaking for myself only , I can not assume the responsibility of witnessing her signature , unless she first understands what the writing is which you wish her to sign . "
110989	110998	111000	111001	Sir Percival	195	" A cool declaration , upon my soul ! "
111003	111044	111000	111001	Sir Percival	195	" The next time you invite yourself to a man 's house , Miss Halcombe , I recommend you not to repay his hospitality by taking his wife 's side against him in a matter that does n't concern you . "
111155	111160	111161	111161	she	8436	" Oh , Marian ! "
111165	111182	111161	111161	she	8436	" If my mother had been alive , she could have done no more for me ! "
111183	111189	111191	111192	Sir Percival	195	" Come back and sign ! "
111201	111205	111206	111206	she	8436	" Shall I ? "
111212	111221	111206	111206	she	8436	" I will , if you tell me . "
111222	111225	111226	111226	I	0	" No , "
111229	111248	111226	111226	I	0	" The right and the truth are with you sign nothing , unless you have read it first . "
111249	111255	111256	111256	he	195	" Come back and sign ! "
111288	111291	111292	111292	he	193	" Percival ! "
111295	111320	111292	111292	he	193	" I remember that I am in the presence of ladies . Be good enough , if you please , to remember it too . "
111352	111366	111344	111345	the Count	2074	" Be good enough , if you please , to remember it too . "
111435	111444	111445	111445	he	195	" I do n't want to offend anybody , "
111448	111525	111445	111445	he	195	" but my wife 's obstinacy is enough to try the patience of a saint . I have told her this is merely a formal document and what more can she want ? You may say what you please , but it is no part of a woman 's duty to set her husband at defiance . Once more , Lady Glyde , and for the last time , will you sign or will you not ? "
111542	111549	111550	111550	she	163	" I will sign with pleasure , "
111553	111589	111550	111550	she	163	" if you will only treat me as a responsible being . I care little what sacrifice is required of me , if it will affect no one else , and lead to no ill results "
111590	111601	111602	111602	he	195	" Who talked of a sacrifice being required of You ? "
111617	111622	111623	111623	she	163	" I only meant , "
111626	111691	111623	111623	she	163	" that I would refuse no concession which I could honourably make . If I have a scruple about signing my name to an engagement of which I know nothing , why should you visit it on me so severely ? It is rather hard , I think , to treat Count Fosco 's scruples so much more indulgently than you have treated mine . "
111728	111731	111732	111732	he	195	" Scruples ! "
111735	111777	111732	111732	he	195	" YOUR scruples ! It is rather late in the day for you to be scrupulous . I should have thought you had got over all weakness of that sort , when you made a virtue of necessity by marrying me . "
111958	111962	111949	111949	him	195	" You idiot ! "
111987	112000	112001	112001	he	195	" You positively refuse , then , to give me your signature ? "
112027	112037	112038	112038	she	163	" After what you have just said to me , "
112042	112076	112038	112038	she	163	" I refuse my signature until I have read every line in that parchment from the first word to the last . Come away , Marian , we have remained here long enough . "
112077	112081	112083	112084	the Count	2074	" One moment ! "
112091	112102	112083	112084	the Count	2074	" one moment , Lady Glyde , I implore you ! "
112118	112128	112129	112129	I	0	" Do n't make an enemy of the Count ! "
112132	112146	112129	112129	I	0	" Whatever you do , do n't make an enemy of the Count ! "
112214	112218	112219	112219	he	195	" Lady Glyde , "
112239	112273	112274	112274	He	195	" pray pardon me if I venture to offer one suggestion , and pray believe that I speak out of my profound respect and my friendly regard for the mistress of this house . "
112281	112287	112288	112288	he	195	" Is it absolutely necessary , "
112290	112307	112274	112274	He	195	" that this thing here , under your elbow , should be signed to - day ? "
112308	112318	112320	112321	the other	1244	" It is necessary to my plans and wishes , "
112324	112342	112320	112321	the other	1244	" But that consideration , as you may have noticed , has no influence with Lady Glyde . "
112343	112367	112274	112274	He	195	" Answer my plain question plainly . Can the business of the signature be put off till to - morrow Yes or No ? "
112368	112378	112320	112321	the other	1244	" Yes , if you will have it so . "
112379	112406	112274	112274	He	195	" Then what are you wasting your time for here ? Let the signature wait till to - morrow let it wait till you come back . "
112418	112432	112433	112433	he	195	" You are taking a tone with me that I do n't like , "
112436	112447	112433	112433	he	195	" A tone I wo n't bear from any man . "
112448	112457	112459	112460	the Count	2074	" I am advising you for your good , "
112469	112582	112459	112460	the Count	2074	" Give yourself time give Lady Glyde time . Have you forgotten that your dog - cart is waiting at the door ? My tone surprises you ha ? I dare say it does it is the tone of a man who can keep his temper . How many doses of good advice have I given you in my time ? More than you can count . Have I ever been wrong ? I defy you to quote me an instance of it . Go ! take your drive . The matter of the signature can wait till to - morrow . Let it wait and renew it when you come back . "
112645	112654	112655	112655	he	195	" It is easy to argue me down , "
112658	112696	112697	112697	He	195	" when I have no time to answer you . I will take your advice , Fosco not because I want it , or believe in it , but because I ca n't stop here any longer . "
112708	112725	112697	112697	He	195	" If you do n't give me your signature when I come back to - morrow ! "
112777	112783	112784	112784	he	195	" Remember to - morrow ! "
112820	112833	112834	112834	he	195	" You have just seen Percival at his worst , Miss Halcombe , "
112837	112885	112834	112834	he	195	" As his old friend , I am sorry for him and ashamed of him . As his old friend , I promise you that he shall not break out to - morrow in the same disgraceful manner in which he has broken out to - day . "
113091	113100	113101	113101	Laura	163	" Where is he going to , Marian ? "
113104	113123	113101	113101	Laura	163	" Every fresh thing he does seems to terrify me about the future . Have you any suspicions ? "
113141	113149	113150	113150	I	0	" How should I know his secrets ? "
113154	113162	113163	113163	she	163	" I wonder if the housekeeper knows ? "
113166	113170	113171	113171	I	0	" Certainly not , "
113174	113185	113171	113171	I	0	" She must be quite as ignorant as we are . "
113192	113229	113188	113188	her	163	" Did you not hear from the housekeeper that there was a report of Anne Catherick having been seen in this neighbourhood ? Do n't you think he may have gone away to look for her ? "
113230	113273	113274	113274	We	2842	" I would rather compose myself , Laura , by not thinking about it at all , and after what has happened , you had better follow my example . Come into my room , and rest and quiet yourself a little . "
113294	113305	113306	113306	she	2843	" I am ashamed to look at you , Marian , "
113309	113351	113306	113306	she	2843	" after what you submitted to downstairs , for my sake . Oh , my own love , I am almost heartbroken when I think of it ! But I will try to make it up to you I will indeed ! "
113352	113357	113358	113358	I	0	" Hush ! hush ! "
113361	113384	113358	113358	I	0	" do n't talk so . What is the trifling mortification of my pride compared to the dreadful sacrifice of your happiness ? "
113385	113394	113395	113395	she	2843	" You heard what he said to me ? "
113402	113432	113395	113395	she	2843	" You heard the words but you do n't know what they meant you do n't know why I threw down the pen and turned my back on him . "
113445	113528	113529	113529	She	2845	" I have kept many things from your knowledge , Marian , for fear of distressing you , and making you unhappy at the outset of our new lives . You do n't know how he has used me . And yet you ought to know , for you saw how he used me to - day . You heard him sneer at my presuming to be scrupulous you heard him say I had made a virtue of necessity in marrying him . "
113550	113560	113561	113561	she	2845	" I ca n't tell you about it now , "
113564	113691	113561	113561	she	2845	" I shall burst out crying if I tell you now later , Marian , when I am more sure of myself . My poor head aches , darling aches , aches , aches . Where is your smelling - bottle ? Let me talk to you about yourself . I wish I had given him my signature , for your sake . Shall I give it to him to - morrow ? I would rather compromise myself than compromise you . After your taking my part against him , he will lay all the blame on you if I refuse again . What shall we do ? Oh , for a friend to help us and advise us ! a friend we could really trust ! "
113759	113770	113771	113771	I	0	" We must do what we can to help ourselves , "
113774	113798	113771	113771	I	0	" Let us try to talk it over calmly , Laura let us do all in our power to decide for the best . "
114451	114462	114463	114463	she	163	" How are we to get the answer in time ? "
114466	114495	114463	114463	she	163	" Your letter will not be delivered in London before to - morrow morning , and the post will not bring the reply here till the morning after . "
114607	114622	114623	114623	I	0	" In case Sir Percival should come back to - morrow before two o'clock , "
114628	114730	114623	114623	I	0	" the wisest plan for you to adopt is to be out in the grounds all the morning with your book or your work , and not to appear at the house till the messenger has had time to arrive with the letter . I will wait here for him all the morning , to guard against any misadventures or mistakes . By following this arrangement I hope and believe we shall avoid being taken by surprise . Let us go down to the drawing - room now . We may excite suspicion if we remain shut up together too long . "
114731	114734	114735	114735	she	163	" Suspicion ? "
114738	114760	114735	114735	she	163	" Whose suspicion can we excite , now that Sir Percival has left the house ? Do you mean Count Fosco ? "
114761	114768	114623	114623	I	0	" Perhaps I do , Laura . "
114769	114784	114735	114735	she	163	" You are beginning to dislike him as much as I do , Marian . "
114785	114812	114623	114623	I	0	" No , not to dislike him . Dislike is always more or less associated with contempt I can see nothing in the Count to despise . "
114813	114824	114735	114735	she	163	" You are not afraid of him , are you ? "
114825	114832	114623	114623	I	0	" Perhaps I am a little . "
114833	114848	114735	114735	she	163	" Afraid of him , after his interference in our favour to - day ! "
114849	114893	114623	114623	I	0	" Yes . I am more afraid of his interference than I am of Sir Percival 's violence . Remember what I said to you in the library . Whatever you do , Laura , do n't make an enemy of the Count ! "
116279	116291	116292	116292	she	194	" The Count will probably want a fresh supply of cigarettes , "
116299	116311	116292	116292	she	194	" and nobody can make them to his satisfaction but myself . "
116431	116438	116439	116439	I	0	" Which way shall we go ? "
116441	116452	116453	116453	she	194	" Towards the lake , Marian , if you like , "
116456	116469	116453	116453	she	194	" You seem unaccountably fond , Laura , of that dismal lake . "
116470	116526	116453	116453	she	194	" No , not of the lake but of the scenery about it . The sand and heath and the fir - trees are the only objects I can discover , in all this large place , to remind me of Limmeridge . But we will walk in some other direction if you prefer it . "
116527	116570	116453	116453	she	194	" I have no favourite walks at Blackwater Park , my love . One is the same as another to me . Let us go to the lake we may find it cooler in the open space than we find it here . "
116706	116714	116716	116716	Laura	163	" It is very desolate and gloomy , "
116718	116730	116716	116716	Laura	163	" But we can be more alone here than anywhere else . "
116774	116802	116803	116803	she	163	" I promised , Marian , to tell you the truth about my married life , instead of leaving you any longer to guess it for yourself , "
116806	116920	116803	116803	she	163	" That secret is the first I have ever had from you , love , and I am determined it shall be the last . I was silent , as you know , for your sake and perhaps a little for my own sake as well . It is very hard for a woman to confess that the man to whom she has given her whole life is the man of all others who cares least for the gift . If you were married yourself , Marian and especially if you were happily married you would feel for me as no single woman CAN feel , however kind and true she may be . "
116950	116954	116955	116955	she	2939	" How often , "
116959	117025	116955	116955	she	2939	" I have heard you laughing over what you used to call your ' poverty ! ' how often you have made me mock - speeches of congratulation on my wealth ! Oh , Marian , never laugh again . Thank God for your poverty it has made you your own mistress , and has saved you from the lot that has fallen on ME . "
117076	117083	117084	117084	she	2940	" You shall not be distressed , "
117087	117592	117084	117084	she	2940	" by hearing how soon my disappointments and my trials began or even by knowing what they were . It is bad enough to have them on my memory . If I tell you how he received the first and last attempt at remonstrance that I ever made , you will know how he has always treated me , as well as if I had described it in so many words . It was one day at Rome when we had ridden out together to the tomb of Cecilia Metella . The sky was calm and lovely , and the grand old ruin looked beautiful , and the remembrance that a husband 's love had raised it in the old time to a wife 's memory , made me feel more tenderly and more anxiously towards my husband than I had ever felt yet . ' Would you build such a tomb for ME , Percival ? ' I asked him . ' You said you loved me dearly before we were married , and yet , since that time ' I could get no farther . Marian ! he was not even looking at me ! I pulled down my veil , thinking it best not to let him see that the tears were in my eyes . I fancied he had not paid any attention to me , but he had . He said , ' Come away , ' and laughed to himself as he helped me on to my horse . He mounted his own horse and laughed again as we rode away . ' If I do build you a tomb , ' he said , ' it will be done with your own money . I wonder whether Cecilia Metella had a fortune and paid for hers . ' I made no reply how could I , when I was crying behind my veil ? ' Ah , you light - complexioned women are all sulky , ' he said . ' What do you want ? compliments and soft speeches ? Well ! I 'm in a good humour this morning . Consider the compliments paid and the speeches said . ' Men little know when they say hard things to us how well we remember them , and how much harm they do us . It would have been better for me if I had gone on crying , but his contempt dried up my tears and hardened my heart . From that time , Marian , I never checked myself again in thinking of Walter Hartright . I let the memory of those happy days , when we were so fond of each other in secret , come back and comfort me . What else had I to look to for consolation ? If we had been together you would have helped me to better things . I know it was wrong , darling , but tell me if I was wrong without any excuse . "
117603	117609	117610	117610	I	0	" Do n't ask me ! "
117613	117629	117610	117610	I	0	" Have I suffered as you have suffered ? What right have I to decide ? "
117630	117638	117639	117639	she	2944	" I used to think of him , "
117651	117809	117639	117639	she	2944	" I used to think of him when Percival left me alone at night to go among the Opera people . I used to fancy what I might have been if it had pleased God to bless me with poverty , and if I had been his wife . I used to see myself in my neat cheap gown , sitting at home and waiting for him while he was earning our bread sitting at home and working for him and loving him all the better because I had to work for him seeing him come in tired and taking off his hat and coat for him , and , Marian , pleasing him with little dishes at dinner that I had learnt to make for his sake . Oh ! I hope he is never lonely enough and sad enough to think of me and see me as I have thought of HIM and see HIM ! "
117871	117880	117881	117881	I	0	" Do n't speak of Walter any more , "
117892	117908	117881	117881	I	0	" Oh , Laura , spare us both the wretchedness of talking of him now ! "
117919	117930	117931	117931	she	2945	" I would rather be silent about him for ever , "
117934	117943	117931	117931	she	2945	" than cause you a moment 's pain . "
117944	117951	117952	117952	I	0	" It is in your interests , "
117955	117970	117952	117952	I	0	" it is for your sake that I speak . If your husband heard you "
117971	117983	117931	117931	she	2945	" It would not surprise him if he did hear me . "
118018	118023	118024	118024	I	0	" Not surprise him ! "
118027	118039	118024	118024	I	0	" Laura ! remember what you are saying you frighten me ! "
118040	118045	118046	118046	she	2945	" It is true , "
118049	118108	118046	118046	she	2945	" it is what I wanted to tell you to - day , when we were talking in your room . My only secret when I opened my heart to him at Limmeridge was a harmless secret , Marian you said so yourself . The name was all I kept from him , and he has discovered it . "
118133	118139	118140	118140	she	2945	" It happened at Rome , "
118152	118811	118140	118140	she	2945	" We were at a little party given to the English by some friends of Sir Percival 's Mr. and Mrs. Markland . Mrs. Markland had the reputation of sketching very beautifully , and some of the guests prevailed on her to show us her drawings . We all admired them , but something I said attracted her attention particularly to me . ' Surely you draw yourself ? ' she asked . ' I used to draw a little once , ' I answered , ' but I have given it up . ' ' If you have once drawn , ' she said , ' you may take to it again one of these days , and if you do , I wish you would let me recommend you a master . ' I said nothing you know why , Marian and tried to change the conversation . But Mrs. Markland persisted . ' I have had all sorts of teachers , ' she went on , ' but the best of all , the most intelligent and the most attentive , was a Mr. Hartright . If you ever take up your drawing again , do try him as a master . He is a young man modest and gentlemanlike I am sure you will like him . ' Think of those words being spoken to me publicly , in the presence of strangers strangers who had been invited to meet the bride and bridegroom ! I did all I could to control myself I said nothing , and looked down close at the drawings . When I ventured to raise my head again , my eyes and my husband 's eyes met , and I knew , by his look , that my face had betrayed me . ' We will see about Mr. Hartright , ' he said , looking at me all the time , ' when we get back to England . I agree with you , Mrs. Markland I think Lady Glyde is sure to like him . ' He laid an emphasis on the last words which made my cheeks burn , and set my heart beating as if it would stifle me . Nothing more was said . We came away early . He was silent in the carriage driving back to the hotel . He helped me out , and followed me upstairs as usual . But the moment we were in the drawing - room , he locked the door , pushed me down into a chair , and stood over me with his hands on my shoulders . ' Ever since that morning when you made your audacious confession to me at Limmeridge , ' he said , ' I have wanted to find out the man , and I found him in your face to - night . Your drawing - master was the man , and his name is Hartright . You shall repent it , and he shall repent it , to the last hour of your lives . Now go to bed and dream of him if you like , with the marks of my horsewhip on his shoulders . ' Whenever he is angry with me now he refers to what I acknowledged to him in your presence with a sneer or a threat . I have no power to prevent him from putting his own horrible construction on the confidence I placed in him . I have no influence to make him believe me , or to keep him silent . You looked surprised to - day when you heard him tell me that I had made a virtue of necessity in marrying him . You will not be surprised again when you hear him repeat it , the next time he is out of temper Oh , Marian ! do n't ! do n't ! you hurt me ! "
119054	119059	119062	119062	her	347	" It is late , "
119065	119074	119075	119075	She	347	" It will be dark in the plantation . "
119082	119093	119075	119075	She	347	" Marian ! it will be dark in the plantation . "
119094	119101	119102	119102	I	0	" Give me a minute longer , "
119104	119113	119102	119102	I	0	" a minute , to get better in . "

119221	119227	119218	119218	she	347	" Let us go back . "
119247	119250	119251	119251	she	347	" Marian ! "
119257	119265	119251	119251	she	347	" Do you see nothing ? Look ! "

119270	119277	119251	119251	she	347	" Down there , below us . "
119421	119430	119431	119431	she	163	" Was it a man or a woman ? "
119451	119457	119431	119431	she	163	" I am not certain . "
119458	119464	119431	119431	she	163	" Which do you think ? "
119465	119472	119431	119431	she	163	" It looked like a woman . "
119473	119486	119431	119431	she	163	" I was afraid it was a man in a long cloak . "
119487	119506	119431	119431	she	163	" It may be a man . In this dim light it is not possible to be certain . "
119507	119529	119431	119431	she	163	" Wait , Marian ! I 'm frightened I do n't see the path . Suppose the figure should follow us ? "
119530	119587	119431	119431	she	163	" Not at all likely , Laura . There is really nothing to be alarmed about . The shores of the lake are not far from the village , and they are free to any one to walk on by day or night . It is only wonderful we have seen no living creature there before . "
119653	119656	119657	119657	she	163	" Hush , "
119660	119667	119657	119657	she	163	" I hear something behind us . "

119739	119769	119736	119736	I	0	" let us walk on . In another minute , if there is anything to alarm us , we shall be near enough to the house to be heard . "

119869	119874	119875	119875	I	0	" Who 's there ? "
119964	119972	119973	119973	she	163	" I am half dead with fear , "

119984	119994	119995	119995	I	0	" We will try to guess to - morrow , "
119998	120015	119995	119995	I	0	" In the meantime say nothing to any one of what we have heard and seen . "
120016	120020	119973	119973	she	163	" Why not ? "
120021	120037	119995	119995	I	0	" Because silence is safe , and we have need of safety in this house . "

120383	120398	120312	120312	she	2468	" In the direction of the lake as far as the boat - house . "

120447	120458	120459	120459	he	2074	" No more adventures , I suppose , this evening ? "

120728	120775	120700	120701	the girl	8026	" Some of us thought of going , miss . But cook said she should take her chair into the cool court - yard , outside the kitchen door , and on second thoughts , all the rest of us took our chairs out there too . "

120836	120856	120813	120814	the girl	8026	" Why ? What do you mean ? Has Mrs. Michelson been taking to her bed in the daytime ? "
120857	120887	120813	120814	the girl	8026	" No , miss , not exactly , but the next thing to it . She 's been asleep all the evening on the sofa in her own room . "

122081	122108	121956	121956	his	3052	" DEAR MADAM , Your letter received this morning has caused me very great anxiety . I will reply to it as briefly and plainly as possible .
122109	122249	121956	121956	his	3052	" My careful consideration of the statement made by yourself , and my knowledge of Lady Glyde 's position , as defined in the settlement , lead me , I regret to say , to the conclusion that a loan of the trust money to Sir Percival or , in other words , a loan of some portion of the twenty thousand pounds of Lady Glyde 's fortune is in contemplation , and that she is made a party to the deed , in order to secure her approval of a flagrant breach of trust , and to have her signature produced against her if she should complain hereafter . It is impossible , on any other supposition , to account , situated as she is , for her execution to a deed of any kind being wanted at all .
122250	122357	121956	121956	his	3052	" In the event of Lady Glyde 's signing such a document , as I am compelled to suppose the deed in question to be , her trustees would be at liberty to advance money to Sir Percival out of her twenty thousand pounds . If the amount so lent should not be paid back , and if Lady Glyde should have children , their fortune will then be diminished by the sum , large or small , so advanced . In plainer terms still , the transaction , for anything that Lady Glyde knows to the contrary , may be a fraud upon her unborn children .
122358	122436	122506	122507	The messenger	2864	" Under these serious circumstances , I would recommend Lady Glyde to assign as a reason for withholding her signature , that she wishes the deed to be first submitted to myself , as her family solicitor in the absence of my partner , Mr. Gilmore . No reasonable objection can be made to taking this course for , if the transaction is an honourable one , there will necessarily be no difficulty in my giving my approval .
122437	122466	122506	122507	The messenger	2864	" Sincerely assuring you of my readiness to afford any additional help or advice that may be wanted , I beg to remain , Madam , your faithful servant ,
122467	122471	122506	122507	The messenger	2864	" WILLIAM KYRLE . "
122524	122546	122547	122547	I	0	" Will you be good enough to say that I understand the letter , and that I am very much obliged ? "
122550	122560	122547	122547	I	0	" There is no other reply necessary at present . "
122689	122701	122702	122702	he	193	" Are you going back to the house , Miss Halcombe ? "
122744	122751	122752	122752	he	193	" I am going back too , "
122755	122778	122752	122752	he	193	" Pray allow me the pleasure of accompanying you . Will you take my arm ? You look surprised at seeing me ! "
122810	122818	122819	122819	he	193	" You look surprised at seeing me ! "
122827	122845	122846	122846	I	0	" I thought , Count , I heard you with your birds in the breakfast - room , "
122857	122927	122822	122822	his	193	" Surely . But my little feathered children , dear lady , are only too like other children . They have their days of perversity , and this morning was one of them . My wife came in as I was putting them back in their cage , and said she had left you going out alone for a walk . You told her so , did you not ? "
122928	122931	122822	122822	his	193	" Certainly . "
122932	123031	122822	122822	his	193	" Well , Miss Halcombe , the pleasure of accompanying you was too great a temptation for me to resist . At my age there is no harm in confessing so much as that , is there ? I seized my hat , and set off to offer myself as your escort . Even so fat an old man as Fosco is surely better than no escort at all ? I took the wrong path I came back in despair , and here I am , arrived may I say it ? at the height of my wishes . "
123268	123279	123280	123280	he	168	" Oh ! here are two of you come back , "
123288	123307	123280	123280	he	168	" What is the meaning of the house being deserted in this way ? Where is Lady Glyde ? "
123332	123338	123339	123339	he	168	" Brooch or no brooch , "
123343	123369	123339	123339	he	168	" I recommend her not to forget her appointment in the library this afternoon . I shall expect to see her in half an hour . "
123409	123415	123416	123416	he	168	" Tell me , Percival , "
123419	123440	123416	123416	he	168	" have you had a pleasant drive ? And has your pretty shining Brown Molly come back at all tired ? "
123441	123456	123386	123386	He	168	" Brown Molly be hanged and the drive too ! I want my lunch . "
123457	123472	123474	123475	the Count	2074	" And I want five minutes ' talk with you , Percival , first , "
123477	123491	123474	123475	the Count	2074	" Five minutes ' talk , my friend , here on the grass . "
123492	123496	123386	123386	He	168	" What about ? "
123497	123506	123474	123475	the Count	2074	" About business that very much concerns you . "
123540	123555	123556	123556	he	168	" If you want to badger me with any more of your infernal scruples , "
123559	123573	123556	123556	he	168	" I for one wo n't hear them . I want my lunch . "
123574	123583	123585	123586	the Count	2074	" Come out here and speak to me , "
123624	123627	123609	123610	The Count	2074	" business , "
123833	123841	123842	123842	he	2074	" A thousand pardons , Miss Halcombe , "
123845	123936	123842	123842	he	2074	" I only venture to disturb you because I am the bearer of good news . Percival who is capricious in everything , as you know has seen fit to alter his mind at the last moment , and the business of the signature is put off for the present . A great relief to all of us , Miss Halcombe , as I see with pleasure in your face . Pray present my best respects and felicitations , when you mention this pleasant change of circumstances to Lady Glyde . "
124392	124399	124400	124400	I	0	" Come back , come back ! "
124403	124430	124400	124400	I	0	" Remember your promise to HER and to ME . Come back to us before the Pestilence reaches you and lays you dead like the rest ! "

124450	124553	124447	124447	he	133	" I shall come back . The night when I met the lost Woman on the highway was the night which set my life apart to be the instrument of a Design that is yet unseen . Here , lost in the wilderness , or there , welcomed back in the land of my birth , I am still walking on the dark road which leads me , and you , and the sister of your love and mine , to the unknown Retribution and the inevitable End . Wait and look . The Pestilence which touches the rest will pass ME . "
124648	124652	124653	124653	he	133	" Another step , "
124656	124676	124653	124653	he	133	" on the dark road . Wait and look . The arrows that strike the rest will spare me . "
124760	124781	124740	124742	The quiet face	3108	" Another step on the journey . Wait and look . The Sea which drowns the rest will spare me . "
124843	124848	124849	124849	he	133	" Darker and darker , "
124852	124913	124849	124849	he	133	" farther and farther yet . Death takes the good , the beautiful , and the young and spares me . The Pestilence that wastes , the Arrow that strikes , the Sea that drowns , the Grave that closes over Love and Hope , are steps of my journey , and take me nearer and nearer to the End . "
125018	125023	125024	125024	I	0	" What has happened ? "

125497	125505	125581	125581	Her	163	" Where did you find your brooch ? "
125527	125534	125581	125581	Her	163	" SHE found it , Marian . "
125535	125538	125581	125581	Her	163	" Where ? "
125539	125580	125581	125581	Her	163	" On the floor of the boat - house . Oh , how shall I begin how shall I tell you about it ! She talked to me so strangely she looked so fearfully ill she left me so suddenly ! "
125636	125640	125641	125641	I	0	" Speak low , "
125644	125680	125641	125641	I	0	" The window is open , and the garden path runs beneath it . Begin at the beginning , Laura . Tell me , word for word , what passed between that woman and you . "
125681	125688	128622	128622	I	0	" Shall I close the window ? "
125689	125717	125641	125641	I	0	" No , only speak low only remember that Anne Catherick is a dangerous subject under your husband 's roof . Where did you first see her ? "
125718	125826	128622	128622	I	0	" At the boat - house , Marian . I went out , as you know , to find my brooch , and I walked along the path through the plantation , looking down on the ground carefully at every step . In that way I got on , after a long time , to the boat - house , and as soon as I was inside it , I went on my knees to hunt over the floor . I was still searching with my back to the doorway , when I heard a soft , strange voice behind me say , ' Miss Fairlie . ' "
125827	125831	125641	125641	I	0	" Miss Fairlie ! "
125832	125896	128622	128622	I	0	" Yes , my old name the dear , familiar name that I thought I had parted from for ever . I started up not frightened , the voice was too kind and gentle to frighten anybody but very much surprised . There , looking at me from the doorway , stood a woman , whose face I never remembered to have seen before "
125897	125903	125641	125641	I	0	" How was she dressed ? "
125904	126373	128622	128622	I	0	" She had a neat , pretty white gown on , and over it a poor worn thin dark shawl . Her bonnet was of brown straw , as poor and worn as the shawl . I was struck by the difference between her gown and the rest of her dress , and she saw that I noticed it . ' Do n't look at my bonnet and shawl , ' she said , speaking in a quick , breathless , sudden way ; ' if I must n't wear white , I do n't care what I wear . Look at my gown as much as you please I 'm not ashamed of that . ' Very strange , was it not ? Before I could say anything to soothe her , she held out one of her hands , and I saw my brooch in it . I was so pleased and so grateful , that I went quite close to her to say what I really felt . ' Are you thankful enough to do me one little kindness ? ' she asked . ' Yes , indeed , ' I answered , ' any kindness in my power I shall be glad to show you . ' ' Then let me pin your brooch on for you , now I have found it . ' Her request was so unexpected , Marian , and she made it with such extraordinary eagerness , that I drew back a step or two , not well knowing what to do . ' Ah ! ' she said , ' your mother would have let me pin on the brooch . ' There was something in her voice and her look , as well as in her mentioning my mother in that reproachful manner , which made me ashamed of my distrust . I took her hand with the brooch in it , and put it up gently on the bosom of my dress . ' You knew my mother ? ' I said . ' Was it very long ago ? have I ever seen you before ? ' Her hands were busy fastening the brooch : she stopped and pressed them against my breast . ' You do n't remember a fine spring day at Limmeridge , ' she said , ' and your mother walking down the path that led to the school , with a little girl on each side of her ? I have had nothing else to think of since , and I remember it . You were one of the little girls , and I was the other . Pretty , clever Miss Fairlie , and poor dazed Anne Catherick were nearer to each other then than they are now ! ' "
126374	126389	125641	125641	I	0	" Did you remember her , Laura , when she told you her name ? "
126390	126416	128622	128622	I	0	" Yes , I remembered your asking me about Anne Catherick at Limmeridge , and your saying that she had once been considered like me . "
126417	126426	125641	125641	I	0	" What reminded you of that , Laura ? "
126427	126521	128622	128622	I	0	" SHE reminded me . While I was looking at her , while she was very close to me , it came over my mind suddenly that we were like each other ! Her face was pale and thin and weary but the sight of it startled me , as if it had been the sight of my own face in the glass after a long illness . The discovery I do n't know why gave me such a shock , that I was perfectly incapable of speaking to her for the moment . "
126522	126531	125641	125641	I	0	" Did she seem hurt by your silence ? "
126532	126963	128622	128622	I	0	" I am afraid she was hurt by it . ' You have not got your mother 's face , ' she said , ' or your mother 's heart . Your mother 's face was dark , and your mother 's heart , Miss Fairlie , was the heart of an angel . ' ' I am sure I feel kindly towards you , ' I said , ' though I may not be able to express it as I ought . Why do you call me Miss Fairlie ? ' ' Because I love the name of Fairlie and hate the name of Glyde , ' she broke out violently . I had seen nothing like madness in her before this , but I fancied I saw it now in her eyes . ' I only thought you might not know I was married , ' I said , remembering the wild letter she wrote to me at Limmeridge , and trying to quiet her . She sighed bitterly , and turned away from me . ' Not know you were married ? ' she repeated . ' I am here BECAUSE you are married . I am here to make atonement to you , before I meet your mother in the world beyond the grave . ' She drew farther and farther away from me , till she was out of the boat - house , and then she watched and listened for a little while . When she turned round to speak again , instead of coming back , she stopped where she was , looking in at me , with a hand on each side of the entrance . ' Did you see me at the lake last night ? ' she said . ' Did you hear me following you in the wood ? I have been waiting for days together to speak to you alone I have left the only friend I have in the world , anxious and frightened about me I have risked being shut up again in the mad - house and all for your sake , Miss Fairlie , all for your sake . ' Her words alarmed me , Marian , and yet there was something in the way she spoke that made me pity her with all my heart . I am sure my pity must have been sincere , for it made me bold enough to ask the poor creature to come in , and sit down in the boat - house , by my side . "
126964	126970	125641	125641	I	0	" Did she do so ? "
126971	127346	128622	128622	I	0	" No . She shook her head , and told me she must stop where she was , to watch and listen , and see that no third person surprised us . And from first to last , there she waited at the entrance , with a hand on each side of it , sometimes bending in suddenly to speak to me , sometimes drawing back suddenly to look about her . ' I was here yesterday , ' she said , ' before it came dark , and I heard you , and the lady with you , talking together . I heard you tell her about your husband . I heard you say you had no influence to make him believe you , and no influence to keep him silent . Ah ! I knew what those words meant my conscience told me while I was listening . Why did I ever let you marry him ! Oh , my fear my mad , miserable , wicked fear ! ' She covered up her face in her poor worn shawl , and moaned and murmured to herself behind it . I began to be afraid she might break out into some terrible despair which neither she nor I could master . ' Try to quiet yourself , ' I said ; ' try to tell me how you might have prevented my marriage . ' She took the shawl from her face , and looked at me vacantly . ' I ought to have had heart enough to stop at Limmeridge , ' she answered . ' I ought never to have let the news of his coming there frighten me away . I ought to have warned you and saved you before it was too late . Why did I only have courage enough to write you that letter ? Why did I only do harm , when I wanted and meant to do good ? Oh , my fear my mad , miserable , wicked fear ! ' She repeated those words again , and hid her face again in the end of her poor worn shawl . It was dreadful to see her , and dreadful to hear her . "
127347	127365	125641	125641	I	0	" Surely , Laura , you asked what the fear was which she dwelt on so earnestly ? "
127366	127373	128622	128622	I	0	" Yes , I asked that . "
127374	127381	125641	125641	I	0	" And what did she say ? "
127382	127762	128622	128622	I	0	" She asked me in return , if I should not be afraid of a man who had shut me up in a mad - house , and who would shut me up again , if he could ? I said , ' Are you afraid still ? Surely you would not be here if you were afraid now ? ' ' No , ' she said , ' I am not afraid now . ' I asked why not . She suddenly bent forward into the boat - house , and said , ' Ca n't you guess why ? ' I shook my head . ' Look at me , ' she went on . I told her I was grieved to see that she looked very sorrowful and very ill . She smiled for the first time . ' Ill ? ' she repeated ; ' I 'm dying . You know why I 'm not afraid of him now . Do you think I shall meet your mother in heaven ? Will she forgive me if I do ? ' I was so shocked and so startled , that I could make no reply . ' I have been thinking of it , ' she went on , ' all the time I have been in hiding from your husband , all the time I lay ill . My thoughts have driven me here I want to make atonement I want to undo all I can of the harm I once did . ' I begged her as earnestly as I could to tell me what she meant . She still looked at me with fixed vacant eyes . ' SHALL I undo the harm ? ' she said to herself doubtfully . ' You have friends to take your part . If YOU know his Secret , he will be afraid of you , he wo n't dare use you as he used me . He must treat you mercifully for his own sake , if he is afraid of you and your friends . And if he treats you mercifully , and if I can say it was my doing ' I listened eagerly for more , but she stopped at those words . "
127763	127772	125641	125641	I	0	" You tried to make her go on ? "
127773	128260	128622	128622	I	0	" I tried , but she only drew herself away from me again , and leaned her face and arms against the side of the boat - house . ' Oh ! ' I heard her say , with a dreadful , distracted tenderness in her voice , ' oh ! if I could only be buried with your mother ! If I could only wake at her side , when the angel 's trumpet sounds , and the graves give up their dead at the resurrection ! ' Marian ! I trembled from head to foot it was horrible to hear her . ' But there is no hope of that , ' she said , moving a little , so as to look at me again , ' no hope for a poor stranger like me . I shall not rest under the marble cross that I washed with my own hands , and made so white and pure for her sake . Oh no ! oh no ! God 's mercy , not man 's , will take me to her , where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest . ' She spoke those words quietly and sorrowfully , with a heavy , hopeless sigh , and then waited a little . Her face was confused and troubled , she seemed to be thinking , or trying to think . ' What was it I said just now ? ' she asked after a while . ' When your mother is in my mind , everything else goes out of it . What was I saying ? what was I saying ? ' I reminded the poor creature , as kindly and delicately as I could . ' Ah , yes , yes , ' she said , still in a vacant , perplexed manner . ' You are helpless with your wicked husband . Yes . And I must do what I have come to do here I must make it up to you for having been afraid to speak out at a better time . ' ' What IS it you have to tell me ? ' I asked . ' The Secret that your cruel husband is afraid of , ' she answered . ' I once threatened him with the Secret , and frightened him . You shall threaten him with the Secret , and frighten him too . ' Her face darkened , and a hard , angry stare fixed itself in her eyes . She began waving her hand at me in a vacant , unmeaning manner . ' My mother knows the Secret , ' she said . ' My mother has wasted under the Secret half her lifetime . One day , when I was grown up , she said something to ME . And the next day your husband ' "
128261	128278	125641	125641	I	0	" Yes ! yes ! Go on . What did she tell you about your husband ? "
128279	128289	128622	128622	I	0	" She stopped again , Marian , at that point "
128290	128296	125641	125641	I	0	" And said no more ? "
128297	128350	128622	128622	I	0	" And listened eagerly . ' Hush ! ' she whispered , still waving her hand at me . ' Hush ! ' She moved aside out of the doorway , moved slowly and stealthily , step by step , till I lost her past the edge of the boat - house . "
128351	128357	125641	125641	I	0	" Surely you followed her ? "
128358	128478	128622	128622	I	0	" Yes , my anxiety made me bold enough to rise and follow her . Just as I reached the entrance , she appeared again suddenly , round the side of the boat - house . ' The Secret , ' I whispered to her ' wait and tell me the Secret ! ' She caught hold of my arm , and looked at me with wild frightened eyes . ' Not now , ' she said , ' we are not alone we are watched . Come here to - morrow at this time by yourself mind by yourself . ' She pushed me roughly into the boat - house again , and I saw her no more . "
128479	128514	125641	125641	I	0	" Oh , Laura , Laura , another chance lost ! If I had only been near you she should not have escaped us . On which side did you lose sight of her ? "
128515	128531	128622	128622	I	0	" On the left side , where the ground sinks and the wood is thickest . "
128532	128545	125641	125641	I	0	" Did you run out again ? did you call after her ? "
128546	128560	128622	128622	I	0	" How could I ? I was too terrified to move or speak . "
128561	128572	125641	125641	I	0	" But when you DID move when you came out ? "
128573	128586	128622	128622	I	0	" I ran back here , to tell you what had happened . "
128587	128603	125641	125641	I	0	" Did you see any one , or hear any one , in the plantation ? "
128604	128621	128622	128622	I	0	" No , it seemed to be all still and quiet when I passed through it . "
128702	128721	128722	128722	I	0	" Are you quite sure you have told me everything that passed ? Every word that was said ? "
128725	128730	128731	128731	she	166	" I think so , "
128734	128769	128731	128731	she	166	" My powers of memory , Marian , are not like yours . But I was so strongly impressed , so deeply interested , that nothing of any importance can possibly have escaped me . "
128770	128810	129082	129082	Laura	163	" My dear Laura , the merest trifles are of importance where Anne Catherick is concerned . Think again . Did no chance reference escape her as to the place in which she is living at the present time ? "
128811	128818	128731	128731	she	166	" None that I can remember . "
128819	128834	129082	129082	Laura	163	" Did she not mention a companion and friend a woman named Mrs. Clements ? "
128835	128879	128731	128731	she	166	" Oh yes ! yes ! I forgot that . She told me Mrs. Clements wanted sadly to go with her to the lake and take care of her , and begged and prayed that she would not venture into this neighbourhood alone . "
128880	128890	129082	129082	Laura	163	" Was that all she said about Mrs. Clements ? "
128891	128898	128731	128731	she	166	" Yes , that was all . "
128899	128918	129082	129082	Laura	163	" She told you nothing about the place in which she took refuge after leaving Todd 's Corner ? "
128919	128926	128731	128731	she	166	" Nothing I am quite sure . "
128927	128942	129082	129082	Laura	163	" Nor where she has lived since ? Nor what her illness had been ? "
128943	128979	128731	128731	she	166	" No , Marian , not a word . Tell me , pray tell me , what you think about it . I do n't know what to think , or what to do next . "
128980	129081	129082	129082	Laura	163	" You must do this , my love : You must carefully keep the appointment at the boat - house to - morrow . It is impossible to say what interests may not depend on your seeing that woman again . You shall not be left to yourself a second time . I will follow you at a safe distance . Nobody shall see me , but I will keep within hearing of your voice , if anything happens . Anne Catherick has escaped Walter Hartright , and has escaped you . Whatever happens , she shall not escape ME . "
129089	129093	129094	129094	she	163	" You believe , "
129097	129162	129094	129094	she	163	" in this secret that my husband is afraid of ? Suppose , Marian , it should only exist after all in Anne Catherick 's fancy ? Suppose she only wanted to see me and to speak to me , for the sake of old remembrances ? Her manner was so strange I almost doubted her . Would you trust her in other things ? "
129163	129198	129221	129221	her	3128	" I trust nothing , Laura , but my own observation of your husband 's conduct . I judge Anne Catherick 's words by his actions , and I believe there is a secret . "
129691	129702	129703	129703	I	0	" You may make your mind easy on that subject , "
129706	129742	129703	129703	I	0	" For the present , at least , neither your resolution nor mine will be exposed to any further trial . Sir Percival has altered his plans the business of the signature is put off . "
129743	129747	129748	129748	Laura	163	" Put off ? "
129752	129758	129748	129748	Laura	163	" Who told you so ? "
129759	129786	129703	129703	I	0	" My authority is Count Fosco . I believe it is to his interference that we are indebted for your husband 's sudden change of purpose . "
129787	129825	129748	129748	Laura	163	" It seems impossible , Marian . If the object of my signing was , as we suppose , to obtain money for Sir Percival that he urgently wanted , how can the matter be put off ? "
129826	129866	129703	129703	I	0	" I think , Laura , we have the means at hand of setting that doubt at rest . Have you forgotten the conversation that I heard between Sir Percival and the lawyer as they were crossing the hall ? "
129867	129875	129748	129748	Laura	163	" No , but I do n't remember "
129876	129941	129703	129703	I	0	" I do . There were two alternatives proposed . One was to obtain your signature to the parchment . The other was to gain time by giving bills at three months . The last resource is evidently the resource now adopted , and we may fairly hope to be relieved from our share in Sir Percival 's embarrassments for some time to come . "
129942	129955	129748	129748	Laura	163	" Oh , Marian , it sounds too good to be true ! "
129956	129999	129703	129703	I	0	" Does it , my love ? You complimented me on my ready memory not long since , but you seem to doubt it now . I will get my journal , and you shall see if I am right or wrong . "
130773	130782	130783	130783	he	168	" Your health and happiness , my angel ! "
130802	130806	130791	130791	He	168	" Good Percival ! "
130840	131069	130826	130826	her	163	" She complied , through sheer astonishment . He sat by the piano , with his watch - chain resting in folds , like a golden serpent , on the sea - green protuberance of his waistcoat . His immense head lay languidly on one side , and he gently beat time with two of his yellow - white fingers . He highly approved of the music , and tenderly admired Laura 's manner of playing not as poor Hartright used to praise it , with an innocent enjoyment of the sweet sounds , but with a clear , cultivated , practical knowledge of the merits of the composition , in the first place , and of the merits of the player 's touch in the second . As the evening closed in , he begged that the lovely dying light might not be profaned , just yet , by the appearance of the lamps . He came , with his horribly silent tread , to the distant window at which I was standing , to be out of his way and to avoid the very sight of him he came to ask me to support his protest against the lamps . If any one of them could only have burnt him up at that moment , I would have gone down to the kitchen and fetched it myself .
131070	131081	131082	131082	he	3168	" Surely you like this modest , trembling English twilight ? "
131086	131211	131082	131082	he	3168	" Ah ! I love it . I feel my inborn admiration of all that is noble , and great , and good , purified by the breath of heaven on an evening like this . Nature has such imperishable charms , such inextinguishable tenderness for me ! I am an old , fat man talk which would become your lips , Miss Halcombe , sounds like a derision and a mockery on mine . It is hard to be laughed at in my moments of sentiment , as if my soul was like myself , old and overgrown . Observe , dear lady , what a light is dying on the trees ! Does it penetrate your heart , as it penetrates mine ? "
131253	131256	131257	131257	he	3168	" Bah ! "
131276	131343	131257	131257	he	3168	" I make an old fool of myself , and only weary you all ! Let us shut up the window in our bosoms and get back to the matter - of - fact world . Percival ! I sanction the admission of the lamps . Lady Glyde Miss Halcombe Eleanor , my good wife which of you will indulge me with a game at dominoes ? "
131661	131664	131665	131665	he	2074	" Listen ! "
131668	131678	131665	131665	he	2074	" There will be a change to - morrow . "
132157	132163	132164	132164	he	2074	" A taste for sweets , "
132175	132205	132164	132164	he	2074	" is the innocent taste of women and children . I love to share it with them it is another bond , dear ladies , between you and me . "
132576	132579	132573	132573	I	0	" Laura ! "
133094	133099	133100	133100	I	0	" Do you know , "
133103	133116	133100	133100	I	0	" whether Lady Glyde has come in from her walk or not ? "
133117	133130	133132	133133	the housekeeper	1357	" My lady came in a little while ago with Sir Percival , "
133135	133149	133132	133133	the housekeeper	1357	" I am afraid , Miss Halcombe , something very distressing has happened . "
133156	133164	133165	133165	I	0	" You do n't mean an accident ? "
133169	133209	133210	133210	Fanny	248	" No , no thank God , no accident . But my lady ran upstairs to her own room in tears , and Sir Percival has ordered me to give Fanny warning to leave in an hour 's time . "
133242	133247	133248	133248	I	0	" Where is Fanny ? "
133251	133279	133305	133305	She	248	" In my room , Miss Halcombe . The young woman is quite overcome , and I told her to sit down and try to recover herself . "
133695	133702	133703	133703	I	0	" Why do you stand there ? "
133706	133718	133703	133703	I	0	" Do n't you see that I want to come in ? "
133719	133729	133678	133678	she	248	" Ah , but you must n't come in , "
133742	133757	133758	133758	She	248	" How dare you talk to me in that way ? Stand back instantly ! "
133789	133794	133795	133795	she	248	" Master 's orders , "
133990	133999	133984	133985	the Count	2074	" No a thousand times over , no . "
134015	134044	134045	134045	I	0	" Am I to understand , Sir Percival , that your wife 's room is a prison , and that your housemaid is the gaoler who keeps it ? "
134048	134059	134060	134060	he	168	" Yes , that is what you are to understand , "
134063	134085	134060	134060	he	168	" Take care my gaoler has n't got double duty to do take care your room is not a prison too . "
134086	134102	134103	134103	I	0	" Take YOU care how you treat your wife , and how you threaten ME , "
134113	134157	134103	134103	I	0	" There are laws in England to protect women from cruelty and outrage . If you hurt a hair of Laura 's head , if you dare to interfere with my freedom , come what may , to those laws I will appeal . "
134169	134176	134177	134177	he	3268	" What did I tell you ? "
134180	134187	134177	134177	he	3268	" What do you say now ? "
134188	134194	134196	134197	the Count	2074	" What I said before , "
134198	134201	134196	134197	the Count	2074	" No . "
134265	134275	134276	134276	she	194	" Favour me with your attention for one moment , "
134287	134335	134276	134276	she	194	" I have to thank you , Sir Percival , for your hospitality , and to decline taking advantage of it any longer . I remain in no house in which ladies are treated as your wife and Miss Halcombe have been treated here to - day ! "
134405	134410	134411	134411	he	2074	" She is sublime ! "
134431	134440	134441	134441	he	2074	" I am at your service , Eleanor , "
134458	134481	134441	134441	he	2074	" And at Miss Halcombe 's service , if she will honour me by accepting all the assistance I can offer her . "
134482	134491	134493	134494	Sir Percival	168	" Damn it ! what do you mean ? "
134509	134530	134532	134534	the impenetrable Italian	3279	" At other times I mean what I say , but at this time I mean what my wife says , "
134536	134555	134532	134534	the impenetrable Italian	3279	" We have changed places , Percival , for once , and Madame Fosco 's opinion is mine . "
134583	134589	134590	134590	he	2074	" Have your own way , "
134605	134617	134590	134590	he	2074	" Have your own way and see what comes of it . "
134634	134642	134643	134643	she	194	" He has gone away very suddenly , "
134646	134652	134643	134643	she	194	" What does it mean ? "
134653	134675	134677	134678	the Count	2074	" It means that you and I together have brought the worst - tempered man in all England to his senses , "
134680	134725	134677	134678	the Count	2074	" It means , Miss Halcombe , that Lady Glyde is relieved from a gross indignity , and you from the repetition of an unpardonable insult . Suffer me to express my admiration of your conduct and your courage at a very trying moment . "
134726	134730	134732	134733	Madame Fosco	194	" Sincere admiration , "
134735	134739	134741	134742	the Count	2074	" Sincere admiration , "
134950	134954	134955	134955	he	2074	" Miss Halcombe , "
134958	135010	134955	134955	he	2074	" I am happy to inform you that Lady Glyde is mistress again in her own house . I thought it might be more agreeable to you to hear of this change for the better from me than from Sir Percival , and I have therefore expressly returned to mention it . "
135011	135015	135017	135018	Madame Fosco	194	" Admirable delicacy ! "
135098	135106	135107	135107	he	168	" What are you waiting there for ? "
135110	135118	135107	135107	he	168	" I want to speak to you . "
135119	135130	135132	135133	the other	1244	" And I want to think a little by myself , "
135135	135146	135132	135133	the other	1244	" Wait till later , Percival , wait till later . "
135242	135249	135250	135250	she	163	" How did you get here ? "
135253	135263	135250	135250	she	163	" Who gave you leave ? Not Sir Percival ? "
135316	135323	135324	135324	I	0	" The Count , of course , "
135328	135334	135310	135310	She	163	" Whose influence in the house "
135344	135351	135352	135352	she	163	" Do n't speak of him , "
135355	135371	135352	135352	she	163	" The Count is the vilest creature breathing ! The Count is a miserable Spy ! "
135428	135437	135438	135438	she	194	" You dropped this downstairs , Miss Halcombe , "
135441	135462	135438	135438	she	194	" and I thought I could bring it to you , as I was passing by to my own room . "
135572	135593	135566	135566	I	0	" Oh , Laura ! Laura ! We shall both rue the day when you called the Count a Spy ! "
135594	135635	135566	135566	I	0	" You would have called him so yourself , Marian , if you had known what I know . Anne Catherick was right . There was a third person watching us in the plantation yesterday , and that third person - "
135636	135645	135566	135566	I	0	" Are you sure it was the Count ? "
135646	135684	135566	135566	I	0	" I am absolutely certain . He was Sir Percival 's spy he was Sir Percival 's informer he set Sir Percival watching and waiting , all the morning through , for Anne Catherick and for me . "
135685	135698	135566	135566	I	0	" Is Anne found ? Did you see her at the lake ? "
135699	135726	135566	135566	I	0	" No . She has saved herself by keeping away from the place . When I got to the boat - house no one was there . "
135727	135732	135566	135566	I	0	" Yes ? Yes ? "
135733	135806	135566	135566	I	0	" I went in and sat waiting for a few minutes . But my restlessness made me get up again , to walk about a little . As I passed out I saw some marks on the sand , close under the front of the boat - house . I stooped down to examine them , and discovered a word written in large letters on the sand . The word was LOOK . "
135807	135823	135566	135566	I	0	" And you scraped away the sand , and dug a hollow place in it ? "
135824	135833	135566	135566	I	0	" How do you know that , Marian ? "
135834	135856	135566	135566	I	0	" I saw the hollow place myself when I followed you to the boat - house . Go on go on ! "
135857	135900	135566	135566	I	0	" Yes , I scraped away the sand on the surface , and in a little while I came to a strip of paper hidden beneath , which had writing on it . The writing was signed with Anne Catherick 's initials . "
135901	135906	135566	135566	I	0	" Where is it ? "
135907	135916	135566	135566	I	0	" Sir Percival has taken it from me . "
135917	135936	135566	135566	I	0	" Can you remember what the writing was ? Do you think you can repeat it to me ? "
135937	135960	135566	135566	I	0	" In substance I can , Marian . It was very short . You would have remembered it , word for word . "
135961	135976	135566	135566	I	0	" Try to tell me what the substance was before we go any further . "
135997	136117	135566	135566	I	0	" I was seen with you , yesterday , by a tall , stout old man , and had to run to save myself . He was not quick enough on his feet to follow me , and he lost me among the trees . I dare not risk coming back here to - day at the same time . I write this , and hide it in the sand , at six in the morning , to tell you so . When we speak next of your wicked husband 's Secret we must speak safely , or not at all . Try to have patience . I promise you shall see me again and that soon . A. C. "
136122	136128	136137	136137	she	163	" tall , stout old man "
136381	136392	136393	136393	I	0	" How came you to lose possession of the letter ? "
136396	136411	136393	136393	I	0	" What did you do with it when you found it in the sand ? "
136412	136419	136420	136420	she	163	" After reading it once through , "
136423	136471	136420	136420	she	163	" I took it into the boat - house with me to sit down and look over it a second time . While I was reading a shadow fell across the paper . I looked up , and saw Sir Percival standing in the doorway watching me . "
136472	136481	136393	136393	I	0	" Did you try to hide the letter ? "
136482	136648	136420	136420	she	163	" I tried , but he stopped me . ' You need n't trouble to hide that , ' he said . ' I happen to have read it . ' I could only look at him helplessly I could say nothing . ' You understand ? ' he went on ; ' I have read it . I dug it up out of the sand two hours since , and buried it again , and wrote the word above it again , and left it ready to your hands . You ca n't lie yourself out of the scrape now . You saw Anne Catherick in secret yesterday , and you have got her letter in your hand at this moment . I have not caught HER yet , but I have caught YOU . Give me the letter . ' He stepped close up to me I was alone with him , Marian what could I do ? I gave him the letter . "
136649	136661	136393	136393	I	0	" What did he say when you gave it to him ? "
136662	136744	136420	136420	she	163	" At first he said nothing . He took me by the arm , and led me out of the boat - house , and looked about him on all sides , as if he was afraid of our being seen or heard . Then he clasped his hand fast round my arm , and whispered to me , ' What did Anne Catherick say to you yesterday ? I insist on hearing every word , from first to last . ' "
136745	136751	136393	136393	I	0	" Did you tell him ? "
136752	136772	136420	136420	she	163	" I was alone with him , Marian his cruel hand was bruising my arm what could I do ? "
136773	136787	136393	136393	I	0	" Is the mark on your arm still ? Let me see it . "
136788	136797	136420	136420	she	163	" Why do you want to see it ? "
136798	136849	136393	136393	I	0	" I want to see it , Laura , because our endurance must end , and our resistance must begin to - day . That mark is a weapon to strike him with . Let me see it now I may have to swear to it at some future time . "
136850	136871	136879	136879	She	3323	" Oh , Marian , do n't look so do n't talk so ! It does n't hurt me now ! "
136872	136878	136393	136393	I	0	" Let me see it ! "
136974	136985	136986	136986	she	3323	" Do n't think too seriously of it , Marian , "
136998	137006	136991	136991	she	3323	" It does n't hurt me now . "
137007	137046	136991	136991	she	3323	" I will try to think quietly of it , my love , for your sake . Well ! well ! And you told him all that Anne Catherick had said to you all that you told me ? "
137047	137066	136991	136991	she	3323	" Yes , all . He insisted on it I was alone with him I could conceal nothing . "
137067	137077	136991	136991	she	3323	" Did he say anything when you had done ? "
137078	137498	136991	136991	she	3323	" He looked at me , and laughed to himself in a mocking , bitter way . ' I mean to have the rest out of you , ' he said , ' do you hear ? the rest . ' I declared to him solemnly that I had told him everything I knew . ' Not you , ' he answered , ' you know more than you choose to tell . Wo n't you tell it ? You shall ! I 'll wring it out of you at home if I ca n't wring it out of you here . ' He led me away by a strange path through the plantation a path where there was no hope of our meeting you and he spoke no more till we came within sight of the house . Then he stopped again , and said , ' Will you take a second chance , if I give it to you ? Will you think better of it , and tell me the rest ? ' I could only repeat the same words I had spoken before . He cursed my obstinacy , and went on , and took me with him to the house . ' You ca n't deceive me , ' he said , ' you know more than you choose to tell . I 'll have your secret out of you , and I 'll have it out of that sister of yours as well . There shall be no more plotting and whispering between you . Neither you nor she shall see each other again till you have confessed the truth . I 'll have you watched morning , noon , and night , till you confess the truth . ' He was deaf to everything I could say . He took me straight upstairs into my own room . Fanny was sitting there , doing some work for me , and he instantly ordered her out . ' I 'll take good care YOU'RE not mixed up in the conspiracy , ' he said . ' You shall leave this house to - day . If your mistress wants a maid , she shall have one of my choosing . ' He pushed me into the room , and locked the door on me . He set that senseless woman to watch me outside , Marian ! He looked and spoke like a madman . You may hardly understand it he did indeed . "
137499	137740	138050	138050	I	0	" I do understand it , Laura . He is mad mad with the terrors of a guilty conscience . Every word you have said makes me positively certain that when Anne Catherick left you yesterday you were on the eve of discovering a secret which might have been your vile husband 's ruin , and he thinks you HAVE discovered it . Nothing you can say or do will quiet that guilty distrust , and convince his false nature of your truth . I do n't say this , my love , to alarm you . I say it to open your eyes to your position , and to convince you of the urgent necessity of letting me act , as I best can , for your protection while the chance is our own . Count Fosco 's interference has secured me access to you to - day , but he may withdraw that interference to - morrow . Sir Percival has already dismissed Fanny because she is a quick - witted girl , and devotedly attached to you , and has chosen a woman to take her place who cares nothing for your interests , and whose dull intelligence lowers her to the level of the watch - dog in the yard . It is impossible to say what violent measures he may take next , unless we make the most of our opportunities while we have them . "
137741	137765	136991	136991	she	3323	" What can we do , Marian ? Oh , if we could only leave this house , never to see it again ! "
137766	137793	138050	138050	I	0	" Listen to me , my love , and try to think that you are not quite helpless so long as I am here with you . "
137794	137822	136991	136991	she	3323	" I will think so I do think so . Do n't altogether forget poor Fanny in thinking of me . She wants help and comfort too . "
137823	137889	138050	138050	I	0	" I will not forget her . I saw her before I came up here , and I have arranged to communicate with her to - night . Letters are not safe in the post - bag at Blackwater Park , and I shall have two to write to - day , in your interests , which must pass through no hands but Fanny 's . "
137890	137894	136991	136991	she	3323	" What letters ? "
137895	138003	138050	138050	I	0	" I mean to write first , Laura , to Mr. Gilmore 's partner , who has offered to help us in any fresh emergency . Little as I know of the law , I am certain that it can protect a woman from such treatment as that ruffian has inflicted on you to - day . I will go into no details about Anne Catherick , because I have no certain information to give . But the lawyer shall know of those bruises on your arm , and of the violence offered to you in this room he shall , before I rest to - night ! "
138004	138013	138057	138057	Laura	163	" But think of the exposure , Marian ! "
138014	138049	138050	138050	I	0	" I am calculating on the exposure . Sir Percival has more to dread from it than you have . The prospect of an exposure may bring him to terms when nothing else will . "
138065	138073	138074	138074	she	163	" You will drive him to desperation , "
138077	138084	138074	138074	she	163	" and increase our dangers tenfold . "
138167	138172	138173	138173	I	0	" To Mr. Fairlie , "
138176	138198	138173	138173	I	0	" Your uncle is your nearest male relative , and the head of the family . He must and shall interfere . "
138205	138210	138211	138211	I	0	" Yes , yes , "
138215	138332	138211	138211	I	0	" your uncle is a weak , selfish , worldly man , I know , but he is not Sir Percival Glyde , and he has no such friend about him as Count Fosco . I expect nothing from his kindness or his tenderness of feeling towards you or towards me , but he will do anything to pamper his own indolence , and to secure his own quiet . Let me only persuade him that his interference at this moment will save him inevitable trouble and wretchedness and responsibility hereafter , and he will bestir himself for his own sake . I know how to deal with him , Laura I have had some practice . "
138333	138376	138211	138211	I	0	" If you could only prevail on him to let me go back to Limmeridge for a little while and stay there quietly with you , Marian , I could be almost as happy again as I was before I was married ! "
138495	138507	138508	138508	I	0	" Your uncle shall know the wish you have just expressed , "
138511	138540	138508	138508	I	0	" and I will ask the lawyer 's advice on the subject as well . Good may come of it and will come of it , I hope . "
138558	138564	138565	138565	she	163	" Do n't leave me , "
138569	138582	138565	138565	she	163	" My desk is on that table . You can write here . "
138681	138696	138697	138697	I	0	" I will come back again , love , in an hour or less , "
138700	138717	138697	138697	I	0	" The worst is over for to - day . Keep yourself quiet and fear nothing . "
138718	138736	138763	138763	her	163	" Is the key in the door , Marian ? Can I lock it on the inside ? "
138737	138760	138697	138697	I	0	" Yes , here is the key . Lock the door , and open it to nobody until I come upstairs again . "
139166	139170	139171	139171	she	194	" Still falling , "
139174	139184	139171	139171	she	194	" I am afraid we must expect more rain . "
139241	139353	139228	139228	Laura	163	" My strong suspicion that she must have told him , my irresistible dread all the more overpowering from its very vagueness of the consequences which might follow , my fixed conviction , derived from various little self - betrayals which women notice in each other , that Madame Fosco , in spite of her well - assumed external civility , had not forgiven her niece for innocently standing between her and the legacy of ten thousand pounds all rushed upon my mind together , all impelled me to speak in the vain hope of using my own influence and my own powers of persuasion for the atonement of Laura 's offence .
139354	139381	139382	139382	She	3351	" May I trust to your kindness to excuse me , Madame Fosco , if I venture to speak to you on an exceedingly painful subject ? "
139412	139426	139427	139427	I	0	" When you were so good as to bring me back my handkerchief , "
139431	139485	139427	139427	I	0	" I am very , very much afraid you must have accidentally heard Laura say something which I am unwilling to repeat , and which I will not attempt to defend . I will only venture to hope that you have not thought it of sufficient importance to be mentioned to the Count ? "
139486	139495	139497	139498	Madame Fosco	194	" I think it of no importance whatever , "
139503	139506	139507	139507	she	3351	" But , "
139518	139569	139507	139507	she	3351	" I have no secrets from my husband even in trifles . When he noticed just now that I looked distressed , it was my painful duty to tell him why I was distressed , and I frankly acknowledge to you , Miss Halcombe , that I HAVE told him . "
139591	139663	139579	139579	she	3351	" Let me earnestly entreat you , Madame Fosco let me earnestly entreat the Count to make some allowances for the sad position in which my sister is placed . She spoke while she was smarting under the insult and injustice inflicted on her by her husband , and she was not herself when she said those rash words . May I hope that they will be considerately and generously forgiven ? "
139664	139668	139670	139671	the Count	2074	" Most assuredly , "

139840	139870	139875	139875	he	2074	" I beg you on my knees to say no more , Miss Halcombe I am truly shocked that you should have thought it necessary to say so much . "
140085	140088	140089	140089	she	8436	" Count ! "
140092	140104	140089	140089	she	8436	" Your foreign forms of politeness are not understood by Englishwomen . "

140709	140720	140706	140706	she	163	" But I heard some one in the outer room . "
140721	140730	140693	140693	she	163	" Was it a man or a woman ? "
140731	140743	140706	140706	she	163	" A woman . I heard the rustling of her gown . "
140744	140750	140693	140693	she	163	" A rustling like silk ? "
140751	140757	140706	140706	she	163	" Yes , like silk . "
140803	140824	140825	140825	I	0	" What became of the rustling of the gown when you no longer heard it in the ante - room ? "
140828	140842	140825	140825	I	0	" Did you hear it go past your wall , along the passage ? "
140843	140857	140872	140872	I	0	" Yes . I kept still and listened , and just heard it . "

140866	140871	140872	140872	I	0	" Towards your room . "

140990	141014	140970	140970	she	163	" Some little difficulty , perhaps . I am thinking of the safest way of putting my two letters into Fanny 's hands . "
141015	141038	140970	140970	she	163	" You have really written them , then ? Oh , Marian , run no risks pray , pray run no risks ! "
141039	141055	140970	140970	she	163	" No , no no fear . Let me see what o'clock is it now ? "

141540	141593	141537	141537	she	194	" He went away two hours since on foot . As I understood it , his object was to make fresh inquiries about the woman named Anne Catherick . He appears to be unreasonably anxious about tracing her . Do you happen to know if she is dangerously mad , Miss Halcombe ? "
141594	141601	141527	141527	I	0	" I do not , Countess . "
141602	141608	141537	141537	she	194	" Are you going in ? "
141609	141628	141527	141527	I	0	" Yes , I think so . I suppose it will soon be time to dress for dinner . "

I have very little time to spare , and I am going to put a great trust in your hands . I wish you to take care of these two letters . The one with the stamp on it you are to put into the post when you reach London to - morrow . The other , directed to Mr. Fairlie , you are to deliver to him yourself as soon as you get home . Keep both the letters about you and give them up to no one . They are of the last importance to your mistress 's interests . "
142380	142388	142389	142389	she	248	" There they shall stop , miss , "
142392	142402	142389	142389	she	248	" till I have done what you tell me . "
142403	142418	142419	142419	I	0	" Mind you are at the station in good time to - morrow morning , "

142479	142552	142603	142603	her	163	" Thank you , miss thank you kindly . It gives one courage to hear your voice again . Please to offer my duty to my lady , and say I left all the things as tidy as I could in the time . Oh , dear ! dear ! who will dress her for dinner to - day ? It really breaks my heart , miss , to think of it . "

142631	142642	142600	142600	I	0	" Has anything happened ? Has any one disturbed you ? "
142643	142649	142603	142603	her	163	" Yes just now Sir Percival "
142650	142656	142600	142600	I	0	" Did he come in ? "
142657	142784	142603	142603	her	163	" No , he frightened me by a thump on the door outside . I said , ' Who 's there ? ' ' You know , ' he answered . ' Will you alter your mind , and tell me the rest ? You shall ! Sooner or later I 'll wring it out of you . You know where Anne Catherick is at this moment . ' ' Indeed , indeed , ' I said , ' I do n't . ' ' You do ! ' he called back . ' I 'll crush your obstinacy mind that ! I 'll wring it out of you ! ' He went away with those words went away , Marian , hardly five minutes ago . "
142804	142819	142603	142603	her	163	" You are going downstairs , Marian ? Come up again in the evening . "
142820	142849	142797	142797	he	3431	" Yes , yes . Do n't be uneasy if I am a little late I must be careful not to give offence by leaving them too soon . "
143159	143167	143169	143170	Sir Percival	168	" What are you going away for ? "
143171	143178	143169	143170	Sir Percival	168	" I mean YOU , Fosco . "
143179	143195	143197	143198	the Count	2074	" I am going away because I have had dinner enough , and wine enough , "
143200	143230	143197	143198	the Count	2074	" Be so kind , Percival , as to make allowances for my foreign habit of going out with the ladies , as well as coming in with them . "
143231	143264	143169	143170	Sir Percival	168	" Nonsense ! Another glass of claret wo n't hurt you . Sit down again like an Englishman . I want half an hour 's quiet talk with you over our wine . "
143265	143300	143197	143198	the Count	2074	" A quiet talk , Percival , with all my heart , but not now , and not over the wine . Later in the evening , if you please later in the evening . "
143301	143304	143306	143307	Sir Percival	168	" Civil ! "
143310	143326	143306	143307	Sir Percival	168	" Civil behaviour , upon my soul , to a man in his own house ! "
143598	143610	143611	143611	he	2074	" Have you any letter for the post , Miss Halcombe ? "
143648	143662	143663	143663	He	2074	" No , Count , thank you . No letters to - day . "
143696	143701	143663	143663	He	2074	" La mia Carolina , "
143897	144031	144056	144056	he	3467	" The English and the Germans he indignantly declared were always reviling the Italians for their inability to cultivate the higher kinds of music . We were perpetually talking of our Oratorios , and they were perpetually talking of their Symphonies . Did we forget and did they forget his immortal friend and countryman , Rossini ? What was Moses in Egypt but a sublime oratorio , which was acted on the stage instead of being coldly sung in a concert - room ? What was the overture to Guillaume Tell but a symphony under another name ? Had I heard Moses in Egypt ? Would I listen to this , and this , and this , and say if anything more sublimely sacred and grand had ever been composed by mortal man ? "

144274	144282	144283	144283	he	3467	" Ah ! if Percival is coming , "
144286	144328	144283	144283	he	3467	" harmony and melody are both at an end . The Muse of Music , Miss Halcombe , deserts us in dismay , and I , the fat old minstrel , exhale the rest of my enthusiasm in the open air ! "
144724	144740	144741	144741	I	0	" I am afraid , Countess , you are not quite so well as usual ? "
144744	144756	144757	144757	she	194	" The very remark I was about to make to you , "
144760	144769	144757	144757	she	194	" You are looking pale , my dear . "
144802	144813	144814	144814	I	0	" I am suffering from one of my bad headaches , "
144818	144843	144844	144844	She	194	" Ah , indeed ? Want of exercise , I suppose ? A walk before dinner would have been just the thing for you . "

144879	144888	144890	144891	Sir Percival	168	" Come and have a smoke , Fosco , "

144941	144956	144938	144938	I	0	" The only remedy for such a headache as mine is going to bed . "
145684	145690	145693	145694	Sir Percival	168	" What 's the matter ? "
145701	145712	145693	145694	Sir Percival	168	" Why do n't you come in and sit down ? "
145713	145725	145727	145728	the Count	2074	" I want to see the light out of that window , "
145731	145739	145727	145728	the Count	2074	" What harm does the light do ? "
145740	145779	145693	145694	Sir Percival	168	" It shows she is not in bed yet . She is sharp enough to suspect something , and bold enough to come downstairs and listen , if she can get the chance . Patience , Percival patience . "
145780	145790	145727	145728	the Count	2074	" Humbug ! You 're always talking of patience . "
145791	145839	145693	145694	Sir Percival	168	" I shall talk of something else presently . My good friend , you are on the edge of your domestic precipice , and if I let you give the women one other chance , on my sacred word of honour they will push you over it ! "
145840	145848	145727	145728	the Count	2074	" What the devil do you mean ? "
145849	145895	145693	145694	Sir Percival	168	" We will come to our explanations , Percival , when the light is out of that window , and when I have had one little look at the rooms on each side of the library , and a peep at the staircase as well . "
147072	147078	147079	147079	I	0	" For Laura 's sake ! "

147533	147541	147543	147544	the Count	2074	" Ouf ! how hot it is ! "
147853	147866	147867	147867	he	2074	" We are at a serious crisis in our affairs , Percival , "
147870	147891	147867	147867	he	2074	" and if we are to decide on the future at all , we must decide secretly to - night . "
147942	147945	147947	147948	Sir Percival	168	" Crisis ? "
147950	147966	147947	147948	Sir Percival	168	" It 's a worse crisis than you think for , I can tell you . "
147967	147983	147985	147986	the other	1244	" So I should suppose , from your behaviour for the last day or two , "
147989	148046	147985	147986	the other	1244	" But wait a little . Before we advance to what I do NOT know , let us be quite certain of what I DO know . Let us first see if I am right about the time that is past , before I make any proposal to you for the time that is to come . "
148047	148061	147947	147948	Sir Percival	168	" Stop till I get the brandy and water . Have some yourself . "
148062	148091	147985	147986	the other	1244	" Thank you , Percival . The cold water with pleasure , a spoon , and the basin of sugar . Eau sucree , my friend nothing more . "
148092	148118	147947	147948	Sir Percival	168	" Sugar - and - water for a man of your age ! There ! mix your sickly mess . You foreigners are all alike . "
148119	148168	147985	147986	the other	1244	" Now listen , Percival . I will put our position plainly before you , as I understand it , and you shall say if I am right or wrong . You and I both came back to this house from the Continent with our affairs very seriously embarrassed "
148169	148216	147947	147948	Sir Percival	168	" Cut it short ! I wanted some thousands and you some hundreds , and without the money we were both in a fair way to go to the dogs together . There 's the situation . Make what you can of it . Go on . "
148217	148316	147985	147986	the other	1244	" Well , Percival , in your own solid English words , you wanted some thousands and I wanted some hundreds , and the only way of getting them was for you to raise the money for your own necessity with a small margin beyond for my poor little hundreds by the help of your wife . What did I tell you about your wife on our way to England ? and what did I tell you again when we had come here , and when I had seen for myself the sort of woman Miss Halcombe was ? "
148317	148337	147947	147948	Sir Percival	168	" How should I know ? You talked nineteen to the dozen , I suppose , just as usual . "
148338	148611	147985	147986	the other	1244	" I said this : Human ingenuity , my friend , has hitherto only discovered two ways in which a man can manage a woman . One way is to knock her down a method largely adopted by the brutal lower orders of the people , but utterly abhorrent to the refined and educated classes above them . The other way much longer , much more difficult , but in the end not less certain is never to accept a provocation at a woman 's hands . It holds with animals , it holds with children , and it holds with women , who are nothing but children grown up . Quiet resolution is the one quality the animals , the children , and the women all fail in . If they can once shake this superior quality in their master , they get the better of HIM . If they can never succeed in disturbing it , he gets the better of THEM . I said to you , Remember that plain truth when you want your wife to help you to the money . I said , Remember it doubly and trebly in the presence of your wife 's sister , Miss Halcombe . Have you remembered it ? Not once in all the implications that have twisted themselves about us in this house . Every provocation that your wife and her sister could offer to you , you instantly accepted from them . Your mad temper lost the signature to the deed , lost the ready money , set Miss Halcombe writing to the lawyer for the first time . "
148612	148621	147947	147948	Sir Percival	168	" First time ! Has she written again ? "
148622	148633	147985	147986	the other	1244	" Yes , she has written again to - day . "
148760	148766	148767	148767	I	0	" Thank your lucky star , "
148774	149027	148769	148770	the Count	2074	" that you have me in the house to undo the harm as fast as you do it . Thank your lucky star that I said No when you were mad enough to talk of turning the key to - day on Miss Halcombe , as you turned it in your mischievous folly on your wife . Where are your eyes ? Can you look at Miss Halcombe and not see that she has the foresight and the resolution of a man ? With that woman for my friend I would snap these fingers of mine at the world . With that woman for my enemy , I , with all my brains and experience I , Fosco , cunning as the devil himself , as you have told me a hundred times I walk , in your English phrase , upon egg - shells ! And this grand creature I drink her health in my sugar - and - water this grand creature , who stands in the strength of her love and her courage , firm as a rock , between us two and that poor , flimsy , pretty blonde wife of yours this magnificent woman , whom I admire with all my soul , though I oppose her in your interests and in mine , you drive to extremities as if she was no sharper and no bolder than the rest of her sex . Percival ! Percival ! you deserve to fail , and you HAVE failed . "
149088	149102	149103	149103	he	168	" Yes , yes , bully and bluster as much as you like , "
149107	149139	149103	149103	he	168	" the difficulty about the money is not the only difficulty . You would be for taking strong measures with the women yourself if you knew as much as I do . "
149140	149153	149155	149156	the Count	2074	" We will come to that second difficulty all in good time , "
149158	149232	149103	149103	he	168	" You may confuse yourself , Percival , as much as you please , but you shall not confuse me . Let the question of the money be settled first . Have I convinced your obstinacy ? have I shown you that your temper will not let you help yourself ? Or must I go back , and as you put it in your dear straightforward English bully and bluster a little more ? "
149233	149257	149103	149103	he	168	" Pooh ! It 's easy enough to grumble at ME . Say what is to be done that 's a little harder . "
149258	149315	149103	149103	he	168	" Is it ? Bah ! This is what is to be done : You give up all direction in the business from to - night you leave it for the future in my hands only . I am talking to a Practical British man ha ? Well , Practical , will that do for you ? "
149316	149329	149103	149103	he	168	" What do you propose if I leave it all to you ? "
149330	149345	149103	149103	he	168	" Answer me first . Is it to be in my hands or not ? "
149346	149356	149103	149103	he	168	" Say it is in your hands what then ? "
149357	149427	149103	149103	he	168	" A few questions , Percival , to begin with . I must wait a little yet , to let circumstances guide me , and I must know , in every possible way , what those circumstances are likely to be . There is no time to lose . I have told you already that Miss Halcombe has written to the lawyer to - day for the second time . "
149428	149441	149103	149103	he	168	" How did you find it out ? What did she say ? "
149442	149581	149103	149103	he	168	" If I told you , Percival , we should only come back at the end to where we are now . Enough that I have found it out and the finding has caused that trouble and anxiety which made me so inaccessible to you all through to - day . Now , to refresh my memory about your affairs it is some time since I talked them over with you . The money has been raised , in the absence of your wife 's signature , by means of bills at three months raised at a cost that makes my poverty - stricken foreign hair stand on end to think of it ! When the bills are due , is there really and truly no earthly way of paying them but by the help of your wife ? "
149582	149585	149103	149103	he	168	" None . "
149586	149597	149103	149103	he	168	" What ! You have no money at the bankers ? "
149598	149610	149103	149103	he	168	" A few hundreds , when I want as many thousands . "
149611	149621	149103	149103	he	168	" Have you no other security to borrow upon ? "
149622	149627	149103	149103	he	168	" Not a shred . "
149628	149642	149103	149103	he	168	" What have you actually got with your wife at the present moment ? "
149643	149661	149103	149103	he	168	" Nothing but the interest of her twenty thousand pounds barely enough to pay our daily expenses . "
149662	149671	149103	149103	he	168	" What do you expect from your wife ? "
149672	149682	149103	149103	he	168	" Three thousand a year when her uncle dies . "
149683	149701	149103	149103	he	168	" A fine fortune , Percival . What sort of a man is this uncle ? Old ? "
149702	149709	149103	149103	he	168	" No neither old nor young . "
149710	149734	149103	149103	he	168	" A good - tempered , freely - living man ? Married ? No I think my wife told me , not married . "
149735	149793	149103	149103	he	168	" Of course not . If he was married , and had a son , Lady Glyde would not be next heir to the property . I 'll tell you what he is . He 's a maudlin , twaddling , selfish fool , and bores everybody who comes near him about the state of his health . "
149794	149846	149103	149103	he	168	" Men of that sort , Percival , live long , and marry malevolently when you least expect it . I do n't give you much , my friend , for your chance of the three thousand a year . Is there nothing more that comes to you from your wife ? "
149847	149850	149103	149103	he	168	" Nothing . "
149851	149855	149103	149103	he	168	" Absolutely nothing ? "
149856	149866	149103	149103	he	168	" Absolutely nothing except in case of her death . "
149867	149877	149103	149103	he	168	" Aha ! in the case of her death . "
149905	149913	149902	149902	his	2074	" The rain has come at last , "
149963	149968	149969	149969	he	2074	" Well , Percival , "
149972	149989	149969	149969	he	2074	" and in the case of Lady Glyde 's death , what do you get then ? "
149990	149996	150051	150051	their	3608	" If she leaves no children "
149997	150005	149969	149969	he	2074	" Which she is likely to do ? "
150006	150017	150051	150051	their	3608	" Which she is not in the least likely to do "
150018	150021	149969	149969	he	2074	" Yes ? "
150022	150033	150051	150051	their	3608	" Why , then I get her twenty thousand pounds . "
150034	150038	149969	149969	he	2074	" Paid down ? "
150039	150043	150051	150051	their	3608	" Paid down . "
150155	150159	150162	150162	her	194	" More rain ! "
150192	150202	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" Percival ! do you care about your wife ? "
150203	150213	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" Fosco ! that 's rather a downright question . "
150214	150226	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" I am a downright man , and I repeat it . "
150227	150240	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" Why the devil do you look at me in that way ? "
150241	150263	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" You wo n't answer me ? Well , then , let us say your wife dies before the summer is out "
150264	150270	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" Drop it , Fosco ! "
150271	150278	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" Let us say your wife dies "
150279	150287	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" Drop it , I tell you ! "
150288	150304	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" In that case , you would gain twenty thousand pounds , and you would lose "
150305	150317	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" I should lose the chance of three thousand a year . "
150318	150348	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" The REMOTE chance , Percival the remote chance only . And you want money , at once . In your position the gain is certain the loss doubtful . "
150349	150442	150185	150186	the Count	2074	" Speak for yourself as well as for me . Some of the money I want has been borrowed for you . And if you come to gain , my wife 's death would be ten thousand pounds in your wife 's pocket . Sharp as you are , you seem to have conveniently forgotten Madame Fosco 's legacy . Do n't look at me in that way ! I wo n't have it ! What with your looks and your questions , upon my soul , you make my flesh creep ! "
150443	150562	150564	150564	he	3610	" Your flesh ? Does flesh mean conscience in English ? I speak of your wife 's death as I speak of a possibility . Why not ? The respectable lawyers who scribble - scrabble your deeds and your wills look the deaths of living people in the face . Do lawyers make your flesh creep ? Why should I ? It is my business to - night to clear up your position beyond the possibility of mistake , and I have now done it . Here is your position . If your wife lives , you pay those bills with her signature to the parchment . If your wife dies , you pay them with her death . "
150590	150595	150597	150598	Sir Percival	168	" Talk ! talk ! "
150600	150621	150597	150598	Sir Percival	168	" One would think , to hear you , that my wife 's signature to the deed was got already . "
150622	150632	150634	150635	the Count	2074	" You have left the matter in my hands , "
150637	150784	150634	150635	the Count	2074	" and I have more than two months before me to turn round in . Say no more about it , if you please , for the present . When the bills are due , you will see for yourself if my ' talk ! talk ! ' is worth something , or if it is not . And now , Percival , having done with the money matters for to - night , I can place my attention at your disposal , if you wish to consult me on that second difficulty which has mixed itself up with our little embarrassments , and which has so altered you for the worse , that I hardly know you again . Speak , my friend and pardon me if I shock your fiery national tastes by mixing myself a second glass of sugar - and - water . "
150785	150794	150796	150797	Sir Percival	168	" It 's very well to say speak , "
150814	150827	150796	150797	Sir Percival	168	" but it 's not so easy to know how to begin . "
150828	150834	150836	150837	the Count	2074	" Shall I help you ? "
150839	150859	150836	150837	the Count	2074	" Shall I give this private difficulty of yours a name ? What if I call it Anne Catherick ? "
150860	150945	150634	150635	the Count	2074	" Look here , Fosco , you and I have known each other for a long time , and if you have helped me out of one or two scrapes before this , I have done the best I could to help you in return , as far as money would go . We have made as many friendly sacrifices , on both sides , as men could , but we have had our secrets from each other , of course have n't we ? "
150946	150983	150836	150837	the Count	2074	" You have had a secret from me , Percival . There is a skeleton in your cupboard here at Blackwater Park that has peeped out in these last few days at other people besides yourself . "
150984	151009	150634	150635	the Count	2074	" Well , suppose it has . If it does n't concern you , you need n't be curious about it , need you ? "
151010	151018	150836	150837	the Count	2074	" Do I look curious about it ? "
151019	151025	150634	150635	the Count	2074	" Yes , you do . "
151026	151136	150836	150837	the Count	2074	" So ! so ! my face speaks the truth , then ? What an immense foundation of good there must be in the nature of a man who arrives at my age , and whose face has not yet lost the habit of speaking the truth ! Come , Glyde ! let us be candid one with the other . This secret of yours has sought me : I have not sought it . Let us say I am curious do you ask me , as your old friend , to respect your secret , and to leave it , once for all , in your own keeping ? "
151137	151147	150634	150635	the Count	2074	" Yes that 's just what I do ask . "
151148	151165	150836	150837	the Count	2074	" Then my curiosity is at an end . It dies in me from this moment . "
151166	151173	150634	150635	the Count	2074	" Do you really mean that ? "
151174	151181	150836	150837	the Count	2074	" What makes you doubt me ? "
151182	151214	150634	150635	the Count	2074	" I have had some experience , Fosco , of your roundabout ways , and I am not so sure that you wo n't worm it out of me after all . "
151254	151259	151260	151260	he	2074	" Percival ! Percival ! "
151264	151454	151260	151260	he	2074	" do you know me no better than that ? Has all your experience shown you nothing of my character yet ? I am a man of the antique type ! I am capable of the most exalted acts of virtue when I have the chance of performing them . It has been the misfortune of my life that I have had few chances . My conception of friendship is sublime ! Is it my fault that your skeleton has peeped out at me ? Why do I confess my curiosity ? You poor superficial Englishman , it is to magnify my own self - control . I could draw your secret out of you , if I liked , as I draw this finger out of the palm of my hand you know I could ! But you have appealed to my friendship , and the duties of friendship are sacred to me . See ! I trample my base curiosity under my feet . My exalted sentiments lift me above it . Recognise them , Percival ! imitate them , Percival ! Shake hands I forgive you . "
151491	151494	151495	151495	he	3617	" No ! "
151498	151526	151495	151495	he	3617	" When my friend has wounded me , I can pardon him without apologies . Tell me , in plain words , do you want my help ? "
151527	151533	151455	151455	His	3617	" Yes , badly enough . "
151534	151545	151495	151495	he	3617	" And you can ask for it without compromising yourself ? "
151546	151555	151455	151455	His	3617	" I can try , at any rate . "
151556	151561	151495	151495	he	3617	" Try , then . "
151562	151591	151455	151455	His	3617	" Well , this is how it stands : I told you to - day that I had done my best to find Anne Catherick , and failed . "
151592	151598	151495	151495	he	3617	" Yes , you did . "
151599	151613	151455	151455	His	3617	" Fosco ! I 'm a lost man if I DON'T find her . "
151614	151624	151495	151495	he	3617	" Ha ! Is it so serious as that ? "
151668	151671	151672	151672	he	2074	" Yes ! "
151675	151695	151672	151672	he	2074	" Your face speaks the truth this time . Serious , indeed as serious as the money matters themselves . "
151696	151710	151455	151455	His	3617	" More serious . As true as I sit here , more serious ! "
151721	151738	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" I showed you the letter to my wife that Anne Catherick hid in the sand , "
151743	151759	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" There 's no boasting in that letter , Fosco she DOES know the Secret . "
151760	151784	151455	151455	His	3617	" Say as little as possible , Percival , in my presence , of the Secret . Does she know it from you ? "
151785	151792	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" No , from her mother . "
151793	151882	151455	151455	His	3617	" Two women in possession of your private mind bad , bad , bad , my friend ! One question here , before we go any farther . The motive of your shutting up the daughter in the asylum is now plain enough to me , but the manner of her escape is not quite so clear . Do you suspect the people in charge of her of closing their eyes purposely , at the instance of some enemy who could afford to make it worth their while ? "
151883	151931	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" No , she was the best - behaved patient they had and , like fools , they trusted her . She 's just mad enough to be shut up , and just sane enough to ruin me when she 's at large if you understand that ? "
151932	151970	151455	151455	His	3617	" I do understand it . Now , Percival , come at once to the point , and then I shall know what to do . Where is the danger of your position at the present moment ? "
151971	152023	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" Anne Catherick is in this neighbourhood , and in communication with Lady Glyde there 's the danger , plain enough . Who can read the letter she hid in the sand , and not see that my wife is in possession of the Secret , deny it as she may ? "
152024	152064	151455	151455	His	3617	" One moment , Percival . If Lady Glyde does know the Secret , she must know also that it is a compromising secret for you . As your wife , surely it is her interest to keep it ? "
152065	152131	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" Is it ? I 'm coming to that . It might be her interest if she cared two straws about me . But I happen to be an encumbrance in the way of another man . She was in love with him before she married me she 's in love with him now an infernal vagabond of a drawing - master , named Hartright . "
152132	152213	151455	151455	His	3617	" My dear friend ! what is there extraordinary in that ? They are all in love with some other man . Who gets the first of a woman 's heart ? In all my experience I have never yet met with the man who was Number One . Number Two , sometimes . Number Three , Four , Five , often . Number One , never ! He exists , of course but I have not met with him . "
152214	152324	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" Wait ! I have n't done yet . Who do you think helped Anne Catherick to get the start , when the people from the mad - house were after her ? Hartright . Who do you think saw her again in Cumberland ? Hartright . Both times he spoke to her alone . Stop ! do n't interrupt me . The scoundrel 's as sweet on my wife as she is on him . He knows the Secret , and she knows the Secret . Once let them both get together again , and it 's her interest and his interest to turn their information against me . "
152325	152341	151455	151455	His	3617	" Gently , Percival gently ! Are you insensible to the virtue of Lady Glyde ? "
152342	152385	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" That for the virtue of Lady Glyde ! I believe in nothing about her but her money . Do n't you see how the case stands ? She might be harmless enough by herself ; but if she and that vagabond Hartright "
152386	152399	151455	151455	His	3617	" Yes , yes , I see . Where is Mr. Hartright ? "
152400	152429	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" Out of the country . If he means to keep a whole skin on his bones , I recommend him not to come back in a hurry . "
152430	152441	151455	151455	His	3617	" Are you sure he is out of the country ? "
152442	152609	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" Certain . I had him watched from the time he left Cumberland to the time he sailed . Oh , I 've been careful , I can tell you ! Anne Catherick lived with some people at a farmhouse near Limmeridge . I went there myself , after she had given me the slip , and made sure that they knew nothing . I gave her mother a form of letter to write to Miss Halcombe , exonerating me from any bad motive in putting her under restraint . I 've spent , I 'm afraid to say how much , in trying to trace her , and in spite of it all , she turns up here and escapes me on my own property ! How do I know who else may see her , who else may speak to her ? That prying scoundrel , Hartright , may come back without my knowing it , and may make use of her to - morrow "
152610	152733	151455	151455	His	3617	" Not he , Percival ! While I am on the spot , and while that woman is in the neighbourhood , I will answer for our laying hands on her before Mr. Hartright even if he does come back . I see ! yes , yes , I see ! The finding of Anne Catherick is the first necessity make your mind easy about the rest . Your wife is here , under your thumb Miss Halcombe is inseparable from her , and is , therefore , under your thumb also and Mr. Hartright is out of the country . This invisible Anne of yours is all we have to think of for the present . You have made your inquiries ? "
152734	152755	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" Yes . I have been to her mother , I have ransacked the village and all to no purpose . "
152756	152765	151455	151455	His	3617	" Is her mother to be depended on ? "
152766	152769	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" Yes . "
152770	152778	151455	151455	His	3617	" She has told your secret once . "
152779	152787	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" She wo n't tell it again . "
152788	152806	151455	151455	His	3617	" Why not ? Are her own interests concerned in keeping it , as well as yours ? "
152807	152812	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" Yes deeply concerned . "
152813	152879	151455	151455	His	3617	" I am glad to hear it , Percival , for your sake . Do n't be discouraged , my friend . Our money matters , as I told you , leave me plenty of time to turn round in , and I may search for Anne Catherick to - morrow to better purpose than you . One last question before we go to bed . "
152880	152885	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" What is it ? "
152886	152967	151455	151455	His	3617	" It is this . When I went to the boat - house to tell Lady Glyde that the little difficulty of her signature was put off , accident took me there in time to see a strange woman parting in a very suspicious manner from your wife . But accident did not bring me near enough to see this same woman 's face plainly . I must know how to recognise our invisible Anne . What is she like ? "
152968	152990	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" Like ? Come ! I 'll tell you in two words . She 's a sickly likeness of my wife . "
153014	153019	153020	153020	he	2074	" What ! ! ! "
153024	153051	153053	153054	Sir Percival	168	" Fancy my wife , after a bad illness , with a touch of something wrong in her head and there is Anne Catherick for you , "
153056	153064	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" Are they related to each other ? "
153065	153072	153105	153106	The Count	2074	" Not a bit of it . "
153073	153079	151739	151740	Sir Percival	168	" And yet so like ? "
153080	153092	153105	153106	The Count	2074	" Yes , so like . What are you laughing about ? "
153116	153123	153125	153126	Sir Percival	168	" What are you laughing about ? "
153128	153325	153105	153106	The Count	2074	" Perhaps at my own fancies , my good friend . Allow me my Italian humour do I not come of the illustrious nation which invented the exhibition of Punch ? Well , well , well , I shall know Anne Catherick when I see her and so enough for to - night . Make your mind easy , Percival . Sleep , my son , the sleep of the just , and see what I will do for you when daylight comes to help us both . I have my projects and my plans here in my big head . You shall pay those bills and find Anne Catherick my sacred word of honour on it , but you shall ! Am I a friend to be treasured in the best corner of your heart , or am I not ? Am I worth those loans of money which you so delicately reminded me of a little while since ? Whatever you do , never wound me in my sentiments any more . Recognise them , Percival ! imitate them , Percival ! I forgive you again I shake hands again . Good - night ! "

155813	155821	155792	155792	He	157	" Lady Glyde 's maid , sir . "
155822	155833	155792	155792	He	157	" What does Lady Glyde 's maid want with me ? "
155834	155839	155792	155792	He	157	" A letter , sir "

160049	160157	160033	160033	he	2074	" is the first essential . Light stimulates , nourishes , preserves . You can no more do without it , Mr. Fairlie , than if you were a flower . Observe . Here , where you sit , I close the shutters to compose you . There , where you do NOT sit , I draw up the blind and let in the invigorating sun . Admit the light into your room if you can not bear it on yourself . Light , sir , is the grand decree of Providence . You accept Providence with your own restrictions .

I am conscious of a terrible necessity for lacerating those sympathies by referring to domestic events of a very melancholy kind . What is the inevitable consequence ? I have done myself the honour of pointing it out to you already . I sit confused . "

160775	160834	160699	160699	I	0	" To my profound sorrow , Miss Halcombe . Perhaps you were in some degree prepared to hear this ? Perhaps when you found that Miss Halcombe did not come here by herself , as you proposed , and did not write a second time , your affectionate anxiety may have made you fear that she was ill ? "
160932	160937	160938	160938	I	0	" Is it serious ? "
160941	160947	160948	160948	he	3861	" Serious beyond a doubt , "
160951	160995	160948	160948	he	3861	" Dangerous I hope and trust not . Miss Halcombe unhappily exposed herself to be wetted through by a heavy rain . The cold that followed was of an aggravated kind , and it has now brought with it the worst consequence fever . "
161037	161041	161042	161042	I	0	" Good God ! "
161045	161050	161042	161042	I	0	" Is it infectious ? "
161051	161056	161057	161057	he	3861	" Not at present , "
161064	161125	161057	161057	he	3861	" It may turn to infection but no such deplorable complication had taken place when I left Blackwater Park . I have felt the deepest interest in the case , Mr. Fairlie I have endeavoured to assist the regular medical attendant in watching it accept my personal assurances of the uninfectious nature of the fever when I last saw it . "
161215	161223	161224	161224	I	0	" You will kindly excuse an invalid , "
161226	161259	161224	161224	I	0	" but long conferences of any kind invariably upset me . May I beg to know exactly what the object is to which I am indebted for the honour of your visit ? "
161367	161374	161375	161375	he	3861	" The objects of my visit , "
161382	161630	161375	161375	he	3861	" are numbered on my fingers . They are two . First , I come to bear my testimony , with profound sorrow , to the lamentable disagreements between Sir Percival and Lady Glyde . I am Sir Percival 's oldest friend I am related to Lady Glyde by marriage I am an eye - witness of all that has happened at Blackwater Park . In those three capacities I speak with authority , with confidence , with honourable regret . Sir , I inform you , as the head of Lady Glyde 's family , that Miss Halcombe has exaggerated nothing in the letter which she wrote to your address . I affirm that the remedy which that admirable lady has proposed is the only remedy that will spare you the horrors of public scandal . A temporary separation between husband and wife is the one peaceable solution of this difficulty . Part them for the present , and when all causes of irritation are removed , I , who have now the honour of addressing you I will undertake to bring Sir Percival to reason . Lady Glyde is innocent , Lady Glyde is injured , but follow my thought here ! she is , on that very account I say it with shame , the cause of irritation while she remains under her husband 's roof . No other house can receive her with propriety but yours . I invite you to open it . "
161730	161733	161735	161735	he	2074	" Hi ! "
161740	161751	161752	161752	he	2074	" Follow my thought once more , if you please , "
161755	162064	161752	161752	he	2074	" My first object you have heard . My second object in coming to this house is to do what Miss Halcombe 's illness has prevented her from doing for herself . My large experience is consulted on all difficult matters at Blackwater Park , and my friendly advice was requested on the interesting subject of your letter to Miss Halcombe . I understood at once for my sympathies are your sympathies why you wished to see her here before you pledged yourself to inviting Lady Glyde . You are most right , sir , in hesitating to receive the wife until you are quite certain that the husband will not exert his authority to reclaim her . I agree to that . I also agree that such delicate explanations as this difficulty involves are not explanations which can be properly disposed of by writing only . My presence here to my own great inconvenience is the proof that I speak sincerely . As for the explanations themselves , I Fosco I , who know Sir Percival much better than Miss Halcombe knows him , affirm to you , on my honour and my word , that he will not come near this house , or attempt to communicate with this house , while his wife is living in it . His affairs are embarrassed . Offer him his freedom by means of the absence of Lady Glyde . I promise you he will take his freedom , and go back to the Continent at the earliest moment when he can get away . Is this clear to you as crystal ? Yes , it is . Have you questions to address to me ? Be it so , I am here to answer . Ask , Mr. Fairlie oblige me by asking to your heart 's content . "
162106	162110	162111	162111	I	0	" Many thanks , "
162114	162177	162111	162111	I	0	" I am sinking fast . In my state of health I must take things for granted . Allow me to do so on this occasion . We quite understand each other . Yes . Much obliged , I am sure , for your kind interference . If I ever get better , and ever have a second opportunity of improving our acquaintance "
162213	162218	162219	162219	he	3870	" One moment yet , "
162222	162497	162219	162219	he	3870	" one moment before I take my leave . I ask permission at parting to impress on you an urgent necessity . It is this , sir . You must not think of waiting till Miss Halcombe recovers before you receive Lady Glyde . Miss Halcombe has the attendance of the doctor , of the housekeeper at Blackwater Park , and of an experienced nurse as well three persons for whose capacity and devotion I answer with my life . I tell you that . I tell you , also , that the anxiety and alarm of her sister 's illness has already affected the health and spirits of Lady Glyde , and has made her totally unfit to be of use in the sick - room . Her position with her husband grows more and more deplorable and dangerous every day . If you leave her any longer at Blackwater Park , you do nothing whatever to hasten her sister 's recovery , and at the same time , you risk the public scandal , which you and I , and all of us , are bound in the sacred interests of the family to avoid . With all my soul , I advise you to remove the serious responsibility of delay from your own shoulders by writing to Lady Glyde to come here at once . Do your affectionate , your honourable , your inevitable duty , and whatever happens in the future , no one can lay the blame on you . I speak from my large experience I offer my friendly advice . Is it accepted Yes , or No ? "
162569	162573	162574	162574	he	3873	" You hesitate ? "
162577	162982	162574	162574	he	3873	" Mr. Fairlie ! I understand that hesitation . You object see , sir , how my sympathies look straight down into your thoughts ! you object that Lady Glyde is not in health and not in spirits to take the long journey , from Hampshire to this place , by herself . Her own maid is removed from her , as you know , and of other servants fit to travel with her , from one end of England to another , there are none at Blackwater Park . You object , again , that she can not comfortably stop and rest in London , on her way here , because she can not comfortably go alone to a public hotel where she is a total stranger . In one breath , I grant both objections in another breath , I remove them . Follow me , if you please , for the last time . It was my intention , when I returned to England with Sir Percival , to settle myself in the neighbourhood of London . That purpose has just been happily accomplished . I have taken , for six months , a little furnished house in the quarter called St. John 's Wood . Be so obliging as to keep this fact in your mind , and observe the programme I now propose . Lady Glyde travels to London a short journey I myself meet her at the station I take her to rest and sleep at my house , which is also the house of her aunt when she is restored I escort her to the station again she travels to this place , and her own maid who is now under your roof receives her at the carriage - door . Here is comfort consulted here are the interests of propriety consulted here is your own duty duty of hospitality , sympathy , protection , to an unhappy lady in need of all three smoothed and made easy , from the beginning to the end . I cordially invite you , sir , to second my efforts in the sacred interests of the family . I seriously advise you to write , by my hands , offering the hospitality of your house and heart , and the hospitality of my house and heart , to that injured and unfortunate lady whose cause I plead to - day . "
163230	163267	163268	163268	I	0	" Dearest Laura , Please come , whenever you like . Break the journey by sleeping in London at your aunt 's house . Grieved to hear of dear Marian 's illness . Ever affectionately yours . "
163290	163325	163287	163287	I	0	" Excuse me I am entirely prostrated I can do no more . Will you rest and lunch downstairs ? Love to all , and sympathy , and so on . Good - morning . "
164818	164826	164827	164827	he	168	" Let us keep the house quiet , "
164830	164873	164827	164827	he	168	" Let us not smoke indoors , my friend , now Miss Halcombe is ill . You go your way , and I will go mine . When I study I like to be alone . Good - morning , Mrs. Michelson . "
165245	165254	165256	165256	her	153	" My place is by Marian 's bedside , "
165260	165279	165256	165256	her	153	" Whether I am ill , or well , nothing will induce me to lose sight of her . "
165366	165372	165345	165345	his	168	" Have you found her ? "
165424	165434	165435	165435	he	168	" Come in here and tell me about it , "
165441	165461	165435	165435	he	168	" Whenever there are women in a house they 're always sure to be going up or down stairs . "
165462	165467	165469	165470	his lordship	3909	" My dear Percival , "
165473	165500	165469	165470	his lordship	3909	" Mrs. Michelson has duties . Pray recognise her admirable performance of them as sincerely as I do ! How is the sufferer , Mrs. Michelson ? "
165501	165513	165435	165435	he	168	" No better , my lord , I regret to say . "
165514	165519	165521	165522	the Count	2074	" Sad most sad ! "
165524	165711	165521	165522	the Count	2074	" You look fatigued , Mrs. Michelson . It is certainly time you and my wife had some help in nursing . I think I may be the means of offering you that help . Circumstances have happened which will oblige Madame Fosco to travel to London either to - morrow or the day after . She will go away in the morning and return at night , and she will bring back with her , to relieve you , a nurse of excellent conduct and capacity , who is now disengaged . The woman is known to my wife as a person to be trusted . Before she comes here say nothing about her , if you please , to the doctor , because he will look with an evil eye on any nurse of my providing . When she appears in this house she will speak for herself , and Mr. Dawson will be obliged to acknowledge that there is no excuse for not employing her . Lady Glyde will say the same . Pray present my best respects and sympathies to Lady Glyde . "
166123	166160	166108	166108	I	0	" and that the symptoms , between the attacks of fever , were certainly those of increasing weakness and exhaustion . Just as I was mentioning these last particulars , Mr. Dawson came out from the bedroom .
166161	166168	166170	166171	his lordship	3909	" Good - morning , sir , "
166196	166211	166183	166184	the doctor	7985	" I greatly fear you find no improvement in the symptoms to - day ? "
166212	166218	166220	166221	Mr. Dawson	262	" I find decided improvement , "
166223	166237	166239	166240	his lordship	3909	" You still persist in your lowering treatment of this case of fever ? "
166242	166257	166259	166260	Mr. Dawson	262	" I persist in the treatment which is justified by my own professional experience , "
166262	166279	166281	166282	the Count	2074	" Permit me to put one question to you on the vast subject of professional experience , "
166284	166366	166281	166282	the Count	2074	" I presume to offer no more advice I only presume to make an inquiry . You live at some distance , sir , from the gigantic centres of scientific activity London and Paris . Have you ever heard of the wasting effects of fever being reasonably and intelligibly repaired by fortifying the exhausted patient with brandy , wine , ammonia , and quinine ? Has that new heresy of the highest medical authorities ever reached your ears Yes or No ? "
166367	166385	166387	166388	the doctor	7985	" When a professional man puts that question to me I shall be glad to answer him , "
166397	166413	166387	166388	the doctor	7985	" You are not a professional man , and I beg to decline answering you . "
166445	166453	166424	166425	the Count	2074	" Good - morning , Mr. Dawson . "
166915	166941	166910	166910	I	0	" My lady , we must all remember not to be hasty in our judgments on our inferiors especially when they come from foreign parts . "
167226	167235	167237	167238	the doctor	7985	" About this new nurse , Mrs. Michelson , "
167240	167245	167237	167238	the doctor	7985	" Yes , sir ? "
167246	167286	167237	167238	the doctor	7985	" I find that she has been brought here from London by the wife of that fat old foreigner , who is always trying to interfere with me . Mrs. Michelson , the fat old foreigner is a quack . "
167299	167306	167307	167307	I	0	" Are you aware , sir , "
167310	167319	167307	167307	I	0	" that you are talking of a nobleman ? "
167320	167343	167237	167238	the doctor	7985	" Pooh ! He is n't the first quack with a handle to his name . They 're all Counts hang 'em ! "
167344	167377	167307	167307	I	0	" He would not be a friend of Sir Percival Glyde 's , sir , if he was not a member of the highest aristocracy excepting the English aristocracy , of course . "
167378	167408	167237	167238	the doctor	7985	" Very well , Mrs. Michelson , call him what you like , and let us get back to the nurse . I have been objecting to her already . "
167409	167417	167307	167307	I	0	" Without having seen her , sir ? "
167418	167688	167237	167238	the doctor	7985	" Yes , without having seen her . She may be the best nurse in existence , but she is not a nurse of my providing . I have put that objection to Sir Percival , as the master of the house . He does n't support me . He says a nurse of my providing would have been a stranger from London also , and he thinks the woman ought to have a trial , after his wife 's aunt has taken the trouble to fetch her from London . There is some justice in that , and I ca n't decently say No . But I have made it a condition that she is to go at once , if I find reason to complain of her . This proposal being one which I have some right to make , as medical attendant , Sir Percival has consented to it . Now , Mrs. Michelson , I know I can depend on you , and I want you to keep a sharp eye on the nurse for the first day or two , and to see that she gives Miss Halcombe no medicines but mine . This foreign nobleman of yours is dying to try his quack remedies mesmerism included on my patient , and a nurse who is brought here by his wife may be a little too willing to help him . You understand ? Very well , then , we may go upstairs . Is the nurse there ? I 'll say a word to her before she goes into the sick - room . "
167881	167886	167877	167877	I	0	" Much as usual , "
168284	168289	168290	168290	he	2074	" Trust Mr. Dawson , "
168293	168364	168290	168290	he	2074	" for a few days more , if you please . But if there is not some change for the better in that time , send for advice from London , which this mule of a doctor must accept in spite of himself . Offend Mr. Dawson , and save Miss Halcombe . I say this seriously , on my word of honour and from the bottom of my heart . "
168427	168478	168415	168415	She	153	" Oh , Mrs. Michelson , I am heartbroken about my sister , and I have no friend to advise me ! Do you think Mr. Dawson is wrong ? He told me himself this morning that there was no fear , and no need to send for another doctor . "
168479	168487	168488	168488	I	0	" With all respect to Mr. Dawson , "
168491	168505	168488	168488	I	0	" in your ladyship 's place I should remember the Count 's advice . "
168529	168533	168534	168534	she	153	" HIS advice ! "
168539	168546	168534	168534	she	153	" God help us HIS advice ! "
169231	169239	169240	169240	I	0	" Has the fever turned to infection ? "
169245	169252	169253	169253	he	262	" I am afraid it has , "
169256	169266	169253	169253	he	262	" we shall know better to - morrow morning . "
169622	169629	169630	169630	he	3909	" When did the change happen ? "
169639	169649	169633	169633	I	0	" Has Lady Glyde been in the room since ? "
169683	169700	169702	169702	his	2074	" Have you and Mrs. Rubelle been made aware of the full extent of the mischief ? "
169730	169736	169737	169737	he	2074	" It is typhus fever , "
169769	169776	169777	169777	he	262	" It is NOT typhus fever , "
169781	169813	169777	169777	he	262	" I protest against this intrusion , sir . No one has a right to put questions here but me . I have done my duty to the best of my ability "
169856	169865	169866	169866	he	262	" I say I have done my duty , "
169869	169905	169866	169866	he	262	" A physician has been sent for from London . I will consult on the nature of the fever with him , and with no one else . I insist on your leaving the room . "
169906	169921	169923	169924	the Count	2074	" I entered this room , sir , in the sacred interests of humanity , "
169926	170001	169923	169924	the Count	2074	" And in the same interests , if the coming of the physician is delayed , I will enter it again . I warn you once more that the fever has turned to typhus , and that your treatment is responsible for this lamentable change . If that unhappy lady dies , I will give my testimony in a court of justice that your ignorance and obstinacy have been the cause of her death . "
170034	170042	170043	170043	she	153	" I MUST and WILL come in , "
170146	170157	170158	170158	he	262	" I am sincerely sorry , I am sincerely grieved , "
170161	170191	170158	170158	he	262	" The fever may , I fear , be infectious . Until I am certain that it is not , I entreat you to keep out of the room . "
170492	170501	170502	170502	he	262	" What is your opinion of the fever ? "
170505	170508	170510	170511	the physician	9845	" Typhus , "
170512	170519	170510	170511	the physician	9845	" Typhus fever beyond all doubt . "
171003	171030	171033	171033	his	9845	" She wants no doctor now all she requires is careful watching and nursing for some time to come , and that I see she has . "
171724	171927	171931	171931	him	4197	" I want to speak to you , Mrs. Michelson , about a matter which I decided on some time ago , and which I should have mentioned before , but for the sickness and trouble in the house . In plain words , I have reasons for wishing to break up my establishment immediately at this place leaving you in charge , of course , as usual . As soon as Lady Glyde and Miss Halcombe can travel they must both have change of air . My friends , Count Fosco and the Countess , will leave us before that time to live in the neighbourhood of London , and I have reasons for not opening the house to any more company , with a view to economising as carefully as I can . I do n't blame you , but my expenses here are a great deal too heavy . In short , I shall sell the horses , and get rid of all the servants at once . I never do things by halves , as you know , and I mean to have the house clear of a pack of useless people by this time to - morrow . "
171938	171964	171965	171965	I	0	" Do you mean , Sir Percival , that I am to dismiss the indoor servants under my charge without the usual month 's warning ? "
171968	172005	171931	171931	him	4197	" Certainly I do . We may all be out of the house before another month , and I am not going to leave the servants here in idleness , with no master to wait on . "
172006	172024	171931	171931	him	4197	" Who is to do the cooking , Sir Percival , while you are still staying here ? "
172025	172054	171931	171931	him	4197	" Margaret Porcher can roast and boil keep her . What do I want with a cook if I do n't mean to give any dinner - parties ? "
172055	172073	171931	171931	him	4197	" The servant you have mentioned is the most unintelligent servant in the house , Sir Percival . "
172074	172165	171931	171931	him	4197	" Keep her , I tell you , and have a woman in from the village to do the cleaning and go away again . My weekly expenses must and shall be lowered immediately . I do n't send for you to make objections , Mrs. Michelson I send for you to carry out my plans of economy . Dismiss the whole lazy pack of indoor servants to - morrow , except Porcher . She is as strong as a horse and we 'll make her work like a horse . "
172166	172201	171931	171931	him	4197	" You will excuse me for reminding you , Sir Percival , that if the servants go to - morrow they must have a month 's wages in lieu of a month 's warning . "
172202	172223	171931	171931	him	4197	" Let them ! A month 's wages saves a month 's waste and gluttony in the servants ' hall . "
172317	172340	172345	172345	I	0	" After that last remark , Sir Percival , I have nothing more to say . Your directions shall be attended to . "
174173	174179	174180	174180	he	168	" Where are you going ? "
174186	174192	174193	174193	she	153	" To Marian 's room , "
174196	174204	174206	174207	Sir Percival	168	" It may spare you a disappointment , "
174209	174224	174206	174207	Sir Percival	168	" if I tell you at once that you will not find her there . "
174225	174231	174180	174180	he	168	" Not find her there ! "
174232	174247	174206	174207	Sir Percival	168	" No . She left the house yesterday morning with Fosco and his wife . "
174312	174318	174319	174319	he	168	" I certainly mean it , "
174322	174338	174340	174340	he	168	" In her state , Sir Percival ! Without mentioning her intentions to Lady Glyde ! "
174352	174355	174356	174356	she	3717	" Impossible ! "
174376	174391	174356	174356	she	3717	" Where was the doctor ? where was Mr. Dawson when Marian went away ? "
174392	174404	174406	174407	Sir Percival	168	" Mr. Dawson was n't wanted , and was n't here , "
174409	174464	174406	174407	Sir Percival	168	" He left of his own accord , which is enough of itself to show that she was strong enough to travel . How you stare ! If you do n't believe she has gone , look for yourself . Open her room door , and all the other room doors if you like . "
174543	174561	174539	174540	Lady Glyde	153	" Do n't go , Mrs. Michelson ! do n't leave me , for God 's sake ! "
174582	174605	174569	174569	she	153	" What does it mean , Sir Percival ? I insist I beg and pray you will tell me what it means . "
174606	174610	174611	174611	he	168	" It means , "
174614	174648	174611	174611	he	168	" that Miss Halcombe was strong enough yesterday morning to sit up and be dressed , and that she insisted on taking advantage of Fosco 's going to London to go there too . "
174649	174653	174569	174569	she	153	" To London ! "
174654	174662	174611	174611	he	168	" Yes on her way to Limmeridge . "
174671	174678	174679	174679	she	153	" You saw Miss Halcombe last , "
174682	174699	174679	174679	she	153	" Tell me plainly , Mrs. Michelson , did you think she looked fit to travel ? "
174700	174709	174611	174611	he	168	" Not in MY opinion , your ladyship . "
174725	174731	174732	174732	he	168	" Before you went away , "
174735	174756	174732	174732	he	168	" did you , or did you not , tell the nurse that Miss Halcombe looked much stronger and better ? "
174757	174767	174768	174768	He	168	" I certainly made the remark , Sir Percival . "
174780	174793	174794	174794	he	168	" Set one of Mrs. Michelson 's opinions fairly against the other , "
174797	174900	174794	174794	he	168	" and try to be reasonable about a perfectly plain matter . If she had not been well enough to be moved do you think we should any of us have risked letting her go ? She has got three competent people to look after her Fosco and your aunt , and Mrs. Rubelle , who went away with them expressly for that purpose . They took a whole carriage yesterday , and made a bed for her on the seat in case she felt tired . To - day , Fosco and Mrs. Rubelle go on with her themselves to Cumberland . "
174901	174915	174917	174918	her ladyship	3717	" Why does Marian go to Limmeridge and leave me here by myself ? "
174924	174940	174941	174941	he	168	" Because your uncle wo n't receive you till he has seen your sister first , "
174944	174979	174941	174941	he	168	" Have you forgotten the letter he wrote to her at the beginning of her illness ? It was shown to you , you read it yourself , and you ought to remember it . "
174980	174986	174917	174918	her ladyship	3717	" I do remember it . "
174987	175028	174941	174941	he	168	" If you do , why should you be surprised at her leaving you ? You want to be back at Limmeridge , and she has gone there to get your uncle 's leave for you on his own terms . "
175038	175045	175046	175046	she	267	" Marian never left me before , "
175049	175057	175046	175046	she	267	" without bidding me good - bye . "
175058	175070	175072	175073	Sir Percival	168	" She would have bid you good - bye this time , "
175075	175144	175072	175073	Sir Percival	168	" if she had not been afraid of herself and of you . She knew you would try to stop her , she knew you would distress her by crying . Do you want to make any more objections ? If you do , you must come downstairs and ask questions in the dining - room . These worries upset me . I want a glass of wine . "
175245	175253	175254	175254	she	267	" Something has happened to my sister ! "
175257	175272	175273	175273	I	0	" Remember , my lady , what surprising energy there is in Miss Halcombe , "
175276	175306	175273	175273	I	0	" She might well make an effort which other ladies in her situation would be unfit for . I hope and believe there is nothing wrong I do indeed . "
175307	175313	175315	175316	her ladyship	3717	" I must follow Marian , "
175326	175359	175315	175316	her ladyship	3717	" I must go where she has gone , I must see that she is alive and well with my own eyes . Come ! come down with me to Sir Percival . "
175490	175502	175503	175503	he	168	" Do you suppose there are any secrets going on here ? "
175508	175526	175503	175503	he	168	" there are none there is nothing underhand , nothing kept from you or from any one . "
175553	175566	175575	175575	she	3717	" If my sister is fit to travel I am fit to travel "
175580	175607	175575	175575	she	3717	" I come to beg you will make allowances for my anxiety about Marian , and let me follow her at once by the afternoon train . "
175608	175617	175619	175620	Sir Percival	168	" You must wait till to - morrow , "
175622	175665	175619	175620	Sir Percival	168	" and then if you do n't hear to the contrary you can go . I do n't suppose you are at all likely to hear to the contrary , so I shall write to Fosco by to - night 's post . "
175725	175734	175735	175735	she	153	" Why should you write to Count Fosco ? "
175742	175754	175756	175757	Sir Percival	168	" To tell him to expect you by the midday train , "
175759	175789	175756	175757	Sir Percival	168	" He will meet you at the station when you get to London , and take you on to sleep at your aunt 's in St. John 's Wood . "
175807	175819	175820	175820	she	153	" There is no necessity for Count Fosco to meet me , "
175823	175834	175820	175820	she	153	" I would rather not stay in London to sleep . "
175835	175936	175790	175791	Lady Glyde	153	" You must . You ca n't take the whole journey to Cumberland in one day . You must rest a night in London and I do n't choose you to go by yourself to an hotel . Fosco made the offer to your uncle to give you house - room on the way down , and your uncle has accepted it . Here ! here is a letter from him addressed to yourself . I ought to have sent it up this morning , but I forgot . Read it and see what Mr. Fairlie himself says to you . "
175954	175958	175959	175959	she	153	" Read it , "
175963	175982	175959	175959	she	153	" I do n't know what is the matter with me . I ca n't read it myself . "
176013	176049	175959	175959	she	153	" Dearest Laura , Please come whenever you like . Break the journey by sleeping at your aunt 's house . Grieved to hear of dear Marian 's illness . Affectionately yours , Frederick Fairlie . "
176050	176067	176069	176070	her ladyship	3717	" I would rather not go there I would rather not stay a night in London , "
176092	176109	176079	176079	I	0	" Do n't write to Count Fosco ! Pray , pray do n't write to him ! "
176133	176142	176143	176143	he	168	" My sight seems to be failing me , "
176195	176204	176206	176207	Lady Glyde	153	" Pray do n't write to Count Fosco , "
176214	176224	176226	176227	Sir Percival	168	" Why not , I should like to know ? "
176240	176269	176226	176227	Sir Percival	168	" Where can you stay more properly in London than at the place your uncle himself chooses for you at your aunt 's house ? Ask Mrs. Michelson . "
176385	176389	176391	176392	Sir Percival	168	" Drop it ! "
176401	176449	176391	176392	Sir Percival	168	" If you have n't sense enough to know what is best for yourself other people must know it for you . The arrangement is made and there is an end of it . You are only wanted to do what Miss Halcombe has done for you - "
176450	176453	176455	176456	her Ladyship	3717	" Marian ? "
176463	176472	176455	176456	her Ladyship	3717	" Marian sleeping in Count Fosco 's house ! "
176473	176552	176553	176553	He	4320	" Yes , in Count Fosco 's house . She slept there last night to break the journey , and you are to follow her example , and do what your uncle tells you . You are to sleep at Fosco 's to - morrow night , as your sister did , to break the journey . Do n't throw too many obstacles in my way ! do n't make me repent of letting you go at all ! "
176572	176579	176580	176580	I	0	" Will your ladyship excuse me , "
176583	176613	176580	176580	I	0	" if I suggest that we had better not wait here till Sir Percival comes back ? I am very much afraid he is over - excited with wine . "
176771	176779	176780	176780	I	0	" Your ladyship will pardon my freedom , "
176786	176852	176780	176780	I	0	" but it is said , ' by their fruits ye shall know them . ' I am sure the Count 's constant kindness and constant attention , from the very beginning of Miss Halcombe 's illness , merit our best confidence and esteem . Even his lordship 's serious misunderstanding with Mr. Dawson was entirely attributable to his anxiety on Miss Halcombe 's account . "
176853	176857	176859	176860	her ladyship	3717	" What misunderstanding ? "
176936	176944	176945	176945	she	3717	" Worse ! worse than I thought ! "
176958	176986	176945	176945	she	3717	" The Count knew Mr. Dawson would never consent to Marian 's taking a journey he purposely insulted the doctor to get him out of the house . "
176987	176996	176997	176997	I	0	" Oh , my lady ! my lady ! "
177000	177004	177005	177005	she	3717	" Mrs. Michelson ! "
177010	177112	177005	177005	she	3717	" no words that ever were spoken will persuade me that my sister is in that man 's power and in that man 's house with her own consent . My horror of him is such , that nothing Sir Percival could say and no letters my uncle could write , would induce me , if I had only my own feelings to consult , to eat , drink , or sleep under his roof . But my misery of suspense about Marian gives me the courage to follow her anywhere , to follow her even into Count Fosco 's house . "
177144	177152	177154	177155	her ladyship	3717	" I am afraid to believe it ! "
177157	177361	177154	177155	her ladyship	3717	" I am afraid she is still in that man 's house . If I am wrong , if she has really gone on to Limmeridge , I am resolved I will not sleep to - morrow night under Count Fosco 's roof . My dearest friend in the world , next to my sister , lives near London . You have heard me , you have heard Miss Halcombe , speak of Mrs. Vesey ? I mean to write , and propose to sleep at her house . I do n't know how I shall get there I do n't know how I shall avoid the Count but to that refuge I will escape in some way , if my sister has gone to Cumberland . All I ask of you to do , is to see yourself that my letter to Mrs. Vesey goes to London to - night , as certainly as Sir Percival 's letter goes to Count Fosco . I have reasons for not trusting the post - bag downstairs . Will you keep my secret , and help me in this ? it is the last favour , perhaps , that I shall ever ask of you . "
177852	177860	177861	177861	she	3717	" I shall see you no more , "
177870	177900	177861	177861	she	3717	" This is our parting our parting , it may be for ever . Will you try to forgive me , Percival , as heartily as I forgive YOU ? "
177923	177929	177930	177930	he	168	" I shall come back , "
178088	178097	178098	178098	I	0	" It is of your own free will , "
178111	178119	178098	178098	I	0	" that your ladyship goes to London ? "
178120	178126	178127	178127	she	3901	" I will go anywhere , "
178130	178144	178127	178127	she	3901	" to end the dreadful suspense that I am suffering at this moment . "
178185	178192	178182	178182	She	3901	" Most willingly , Mrs. Michelson . "
178193	178205	178206	178206	I	0	" We all have our crosses to bear , my lady , "

178269	178277	178266	178266	she	3901	" I was terribly disturbed by dreams . "
178278	178284	178287	178287	she	3901	" Indeed , my lady ? "
178311	178324	178362	178362	She	3901	" You posted the letter to Mrs. Vesey with your own hands ? "
178325	178331	178362	178362	She	3901	" Yes , my lady . "
178332	178353	178362	178362	She	3901	" Did Sir Percival say , yesterday , that Count Fosco was to meet me at the terminus in London ? "
178354	178361	178362	178362	She	3901	" He did , my lady . "

178623	178655	178621	178621	she	3901	" kind when we were both friendless . I shall remember you gratefully , as long as I live to remember any one . Good - bye and God bless you ! "

178772	178797	178764	178764	she	3901	" My dreams , last night , were dreams I have never had before . The terror of them is hanging over me still . "
179078	179086	179087	179087	she	4384	" What is the matter , ma'am ? "
179091	179095	179096	179096	I	0	" You here ! "
179100	179111	179096	179096	I	0	" Not gone to London ! Not gone to Cumberland ! "
179125	179129	179130	179130	she	4384	" Certainly not , "

179421	179427	179428	179428	he	4387	" Well , Mrs. Michelson , "
179431	179443	179428	179428	he	4387	" you have found it out at last , have you ? "
179455	179465	179449	179449	He	4387	" When did you show yourself in the garden ? "
179466	179497	179449	179449	He	4387	" I showed myself about half an hour ago , sir . You said I might take my liberty again as soon as Lady Glyde had gone away to London . "
179498	179513	179514	179514	He	4387	" Quite right . I do n't blame you I only asked the question . "
179528	179538	179539	179539	he	4387	" You ca n't believe it , can you ? "
179543	179553	179539	179539	he	4387	" Here ! come along and see for yourself . "
179599	179602	179603	179603	he	4387	" There ! "
179606	179671	179603	179603	he	4387	" Look up at the first floor . You know the old Elizabethan bedrooms ? Miss Halcombe is snug and safe in one of the best of them at this moment . Take her in , Mrs. Rubelle you have got your key ? ; take Mrs. Michelson in , and let her own eyes satisfy her that there is no deception this time . "
179795	179814	179815	179815	I	0	" I must beg permission , Sir Percival , to speak a few words to you in private , "
179818	179838	179815	179815	I	0	" Having done so , I shall be ready to proceed with this person to Miss Halcombe 's room . "
179872	179875	179877	179878	Sir Percival	168	" Well , "
179881	179887	179877	179878	Sir Percival	168	" what is it now ? "
179888	179911	179916	179916	I	0	" I wish to mention , sir , that I am desirous of resigning the situation I now hold at Blackwater Park . "
179967	179970	179971	179971	he	168	" Why ? "
179974	179983	179971	179971	he	168	" why , I should like to know ? "
179984	180043	179943	179943	He	168	" It is not for me , Sir Percival , to express an opinion on what has taken place in this house . I desire to give no offence . I merely wish to say that I do not feel it consistent with my duty to Lady Glyde and to myself to remain any longer in your service . "
180044	180065	180066	180066	he	168	" Is it consistent with your duty to me to stand there , casting suspicion on me to my face ? "
180075	180298	180070	180070	his	168	" I see what you 're driving at . You have taken your own mean , underhand view of an innocent deception practised on Lady Glyde for her own good . It was essential to her health that she should have a change of air immediately , and you know as well as I do she would never have gone away if she had been told Miss Halcombe was still left here . She has been deceived in her own interests and I do n't care who knows it . Go , if you like there are plenty of housekeepers as good as you to be had for the asking . Go when you please but take care how you spread scandals about me and my affairs when you 're out of my service . Tell the truth , and nothing but the truth , or it will be the worse for you ! See Miss Halcombe for yourself see if she has n't been as well taken care of in one part of the house as in the other . Remember the doctor 's own orders that Lady Glyde was to have a change of air at the earliest possible opportunity . Bear all that well in mind , and then say anything against me and my proceedings if you dare ! "
180441	180452	180453	180453	I	0	" While I am in your service , Sir Percival , "
180456	180499	180453	180453	I	0	" I hope I know my duty well enough not to inquire into your motives . When I am out of your service , I hope I know my own place well enough not to speak of matters which do n't concern me "
180500	180508	180509	180509	he	4399	" When do you want to go ? "
180517	180560	180509	180509	he	4399	" Do n't suppose I am anxious to keep you do n't suppose I care about your leaving the house . I am perfectly fair and open in this matter , from first to last . When do you want to go ? "
180561	180575	180453	180453	I	0	" I should wish to leave at your earliest convenience , Sir Percival . "
180576	180673	180509	180509	he	4399	" My convenience has nothing to do with it . I shall be out of the house for good and all to - morrow morning , and I can settle your accounts to - night . If you want to study anybody 's convenience , it had better be Miss Halcombe 's . Mrs. Rubelle 's time is up to - day , and she has reasons for wishing to be in London to - night . If you go at once , Miss Halcombe wo n't have a soul left here to look after her . "
180882	180890	180891	180891	he	168	" Why are you leaving my service ? "
180920	180932	180933	180933	he	168	" Mind ! I do n't know why you are going , "
180937	180970	180933	180933	he	168	" You must give a reason for leaving me , I suppose , when you get another situation . What reason ? The breaking up of the family ? Is that it ? "
180971	180985	180933	180933	he	168	" There can be no positive objection , Sir Percival , to that reason "
180986	181026	180933	180933	he	168	" Very well ! That 's all I want to know . If people apply for your character , that 's your reason , stated by yourself . You go in consequence of the breaking up of the family . "
181080	181084	181085	181085	she	263	" At last ! "
181249	181259	181261	181262	Mrs. Rubelle	263	" I am glad to hear it , ma'am , "
181264	181272	181261	181262	Mrs. Rubelle	263	" I want to go very much . "
181273	181281	181282	181282	I	0	" Do you leave to - day ? "
181291	181363	181364	181364	She	153	" Now that you have taken charge , ma'am , I leave in half an hour 's time . Sir Percival has kindly placed at my disposition the gardener , and the chaise , whenever I want them . I shall want them in half an hour 's time to go to the station . I am packed up in anticipation already . I wish you good - day , ma'am . "
183998	184006	184007	184007	he	270	" This is a very serious case , "
184010	184023	184007	184007	he	270	" I recommend you to write to Lady Glyde 's friends directly . "
184030	184037	184007	184007	he	270	" Is it heart - disease ? "
184042	184054	184039	184039	he	270	" Yes , heart - disease of a most dangerous kind . "
184160	184172	184173	184173	he	270	" Ah ! poor Lady Glyde ! poor dear Lady Glyde ! "
184641	184643	184638	184639	my mistress	9668	" Yes "
184825	184830	184832	184832	he	7910	" Good Mrs. Cook , "
184834	184915	184832	184832	he	7910	" Lady Glyde is better . My mind is more easy than it was , and I am going out to stretch my big legs with a sunny little summer walk . Shall I order for you , shall I market for you , Mrs. Cook ? What are you making there ? A nice tart for dinner ? Much crust , if you please much crisp crust , my dear , that melts and crumbles delicious in the mouth . "
185150	185158	185160	185161	my mistress	9668	" Lady Glyde was just as usual , "
185202	185242	185196	185196	she	703	" The doctor went up to the bed , and stooped down over the sick lady . He looked very serious , all on a sudden , at the sight of her , and put his hand on her heart .
185253	185257	185259	185259	she	9668	" Not dead ! "
185274	185277	185279	185280	the doctor	7985	" Yes , "
185287	185304	185279	185280	the doctor	7985	" Dead . I was afraid it would happen suddenly when I examined her heart yesterday . "
185323	185326	185327	185327	she	9668	" Dead ! "
185332	185347	185327	185327	she	9668	" dead so suddenly ! dead so soon ! What will the Count say ? "
185362	185371	185373	185373	he	7985	" You have been sitting up all night , "
185375	185385	185387	185387	he	7985	" and your nerves are shaken . This person , "
185392	185409	185387	185387	he	7985	" this person will stay in the room till I can send for the necessary assistance . "
185418	185425	185426	185426	she	9668	" I must prepare the Count , "
185429	185437	185426	185426	she	9668	" I must carefully prepare the Count . "
185454	185461	185463	185464	Mr. Goodricke	270	" Your master is a foreigner , "
185473	185482	185463	185464	Mr. Goodricke	270	" Does he understand about registering the death ? "
185483	185492	185494	185494	I	0	" I ca n't rightly tell , sir , "
185496	185503	185494	185494	I	0	" but I should think not . "
185515	185524	185526	185526	he	7985	" I do n't usually do such things , "
185528	185578	185526	185526	he	7985	" but it may save the family trouble in this case if I register the death myself . I shall pass the district office in half an hour 's time , and I can easily look in . Mention , if you please , that I will do so . "
185579	185584	185586	185586	I	0	" Yes , sir , "
185588	185604	185586	185586	I	0	" with thanks , I 'm sure , for your kindness in thinking of it . "
185605	185621	185623	185623	he	7985	" You do n't mind staying here till I can send you the proper person ? "
185625	185630	185632	185632	I	0	" No , sir , "
185634	185659	185632	185632	I	0	" I 'll stay with the poor lady till then . I suppose nothing more could be done , sir , than was done ? "
185662	185665	185667	185667	he	7985	" No , "
185669	185692	185667	185667	he	7985	" nothing ; she must have suffered sadly before ever I saw her the case was hopeless when I was called in . "
185693	185715	185718	185718	He	7985	" Ah , dear me ! we all come to it , sooner or later , do n't we , sir ? "
185736	185741	185733	185733	He	7985	" Good - day , "

200852	200971	200849	200849	I	0	" that I shall be seen in London again so soon , either by Sir Percival himself or by the persons in his employ . But it is barely possible that an accident may happen . In that case , you will not be alarmed if I fail to return to - night , and you will satisfy any inquiry of Laura 's with the best excuse that you can make for me ? If I find the least reason to suspect that I am watched , I will take good care that no spy follows me back to this house . Do n't doubt my return , Marian , however it may be delayed and fear nothing . "
200972	200975	200976	200976	she	5243	" Nothing ! "
200980	200998	200999	200999	She	5243	" You shall not regret , Walter , that you have only a woman to help you . "
201010	201014	201015	201015	she	5243	" Take care ! "
201022	201026	201015	201015	she	5243	" take care ! "
201457	201469	201470	201470	I	0	" Before I enter on the business which brings me here , "
201473	201498	201470	201470	I	0	" I ought to warn you , Mr. Kyrle , that the shortest statement I can make of it may occupy some little time . "
201499	201509	201510	201510	he	240	" My time is at Miss Halcombe 's disposal , "
201513	201554	201470	201470	I	0	" Where any interests of hers are concerned , I represent my partner personally , as well as professionally . It was his request that I should do so , when he ceased to take an active part in business . "
201555	201566	201470	201470	I	0	" May I inquire whether Mr. Gilmore is in England ? "
201567	201596	201470	201470	I	0	" He is not , he is living with his relatives in Germany . His health has improved , but the period of his return is still uncertain . "
201771	201780	201781	201781	He	240	" What is your opinion , Mr. Kyrle ? "
201802	201809	201810	201810	he	240	" Before I give my opinion , "
201813	201827	201810	201810	he	240	" I must beg permission to clear the ground by a few questions . "
201891	201905	201906	201906	I	0	" Do you believe that I have spoken the truth , Mr. Kyrle ? "
201916	201935	201936	201936	he	240	" So far as your own convictions are concerned , I am certain you have spoken the truth , "
201939	202054	201936	201936	he	240	" I have the highest esteem for Miss Halcombe , and I have therefore every reason to respect a gentleman whose mediation she trusts in a matter of this kind . I will even go farther , if you like , and admit , for courtesy 's sake and for argument 's sake , that the identity of Lady Glyde as a living person is a proved fact to Miss Halcombe and yourself . But you come to me for a legal opinion . As a lawyer , and as a lawyer only , it is my duty to tell you , Mr. Hartright , that you have not the shadow of a case . "
202055	202064	201910	201910	he	240	" You put it strongly , Mr. Kyrle . "
202065	202623	201936	201936	he	240	" I will try to put it plainly as well . The evidence of Lady Glyde 's death is , on the face of it , clear and satisfactory . There is her aunt 's testimony to prove that she came to Count Fosco 's house , that she fell ill , and that she died . There is the testimony of the medical certificate to prove the death , and to show that it took place under natural circumstances . There is the fact of the funeral at Limmeridge , and there is the assertion of the inscription on the tomb . That is the case you want to overthrow . What evidence have you to support the declaration on your side that the person who died and was buried was not Lady Glyde ? Let us run through the main points of your statement and see what they are worth . Miss Halcombe goes to a certain private Asylum , and there sees a certain female patient . It is known that a woman named Anne Catherick , and bearing an extraordinary personal resemblance to Lady Glyde , escaped from the Asylum ; it is known that the person received there last July was received as Anne Catherick brought back ; it is known that the gentleman who brought her back warned Mr. Fairlie that it was part of her insanity to be bent on personating his dead niece ; and it is known that she did repeatedly declare herself in the Asylum where no one believed her to be Lady Glyde . These are all facts . What have you to set against them ? Miss Halcombe 's recognition of the woman , which recognition after - events invalidate or contradict . Does Miss Halcombe assert her supposed sister 's identity to the owner of the Asylum , and take legal means for rescuing her ? No , she secretly bribes a nurse to let her escape . When the patient has been released in this doubtful manner , and is taken to Mr. Fairlie , does he recognise her ? Is he staggered for one instant in his belief of his niece 's death ? No . Do the servants recognise her ? No . Is she kept in the neighbourhood to assert her own identity , and to stand the test of further proceedings ? No , she is privately taken to London . In the meantime you have recognised her also , but you are not a relative you are not even an old friend of the family . The servants contradict you , and Mr. Fairlie contradicts Miss Halcombe , and the supposed Lady Glyde contradicts herself . She declares she passed the night in London at a certain house . Your own evidence shows that she has never been near that house , and your own admission is that her condition of mind prevents you from producing her anywhere to submit to investigation , and to speak for herself . I pass over minor points of evidence on both sides to save time , and I ask you , if this case were to go now into a court of law to go before a jury , bound to take facts as they reasonably appear where are your proofs ? "
202686	202693	202694	202694	I	0	" There can be no doubt , "
202697	202715	202694	202694	I	0	" that the facts , as you have stated them , appear to tell against us , but "
202716	202727	202729	202730	Mr. Kyrle	240	" But you think those facts can be explained away , "
202732	202875	202729	202730	Mr. Kyrle	240	" Let me tell you the result of my experience on that point . When an English jury has to choose between a plain fact ON the surface and a long explanation UNDER the surface , it always takes the fact in preference to the explanation . For example , Lady Glyde I call the lady you represent by that name for argument 's sake declares she has slept at a certain house , and it is proved that she has not slept at that house . You explain this circumstance by entering into the state of her mind , and deducing from it a metaphysical conclusion . I do n't say the conclusion is wrong I only say that the jury will take the fact of her contradicting herself in preference to any reason for the contradiction that you can offer . "
202876	202883	202884	202884	I	0	" But is it not possible , "
202887	202909	202884	202884	I	0	" by dint of patience and exertion , to discover additional evidence ? Miss Halcombe and I have a few hundred pounds "
202926	202941	202942	202942	he	5266	" Consider the subject , Mr. Hartright , from your own point of view , "
202945	203145	202942	202942	he	5266	" If you are right about Sir Percival Glyde and Count Fosco which I do n't admit , mind , every imaginable difficulty would be thrown in the way of your getting fresh evidence . Every obstacle of litigation would be raised every point in the case would be systematically contested and by the time we had spent our thousands instead of our hundreds , the final result would , in all probability , be against us . Questions of identity , where instances of personal resemblance are concerned , are , in themselves , the hardest of all questions to settle the hardest , even when they are free from the complications which beset the case we are now discussing . I really see no prospect of throwing any light whatever on this extraordinary affair . Even if the person buried in Limmeridge churchyard be not Lady Glyde , she was , in life , on your own showing , so like her , that we should gain nothing , if we applied for the necessary authority to have the body exhumed . In short , there is no case , Mr. Hartright there is really no case . "
203172	203188	203189	203189	I	0	" Are there not other proofs that we might produce besides the proof of identity ? "
203192	203199	203200	203200	he	5267	" Not as you are situated , "
203203	203279	203200	203200	he	5267	" The simplest and surest of all proofs , the proof by comparison of dates , is , as I understand , altogether out of your reach . If you could show a discrepancy between the date of the doctor 's certificate and the date of Lady Glyde 's journey to London , the matter would wear a totally different aspect , and I should be the first to say , Let us go on . "
203280	203291	203341	203342	The housekeeper	1357	" That date may yet be recovered , Mr. Kyrle . "
203292	203337	203200	203200	he	5267	" On the day when it is recovered , Mr. Hartright , you will have a case . If you have any prospect , at this moment , of getting at it tell me , and we shall see if I can advise you . "
203378	203392	203393	203393	I	0	" I can think of no means of ascertaining the date at present , "
203396	203419	203393	203393	I	0	" because I can think of no persons who are sure to know it , but Count Fosco and Sir Percival Glyde . "
203437	203449	203450	203450	he	240	" With your opinion of the conduct of those two gentlemen , "
203453	203492	203450	203450	he	240	" you do n't expect help in that quarter , I presume ? If they have combined to gain large sums of money by a conspiracy , they are not likely to confess it , at any rate . "
203493	203505	203520	203520	He	240	" They may be forced to confess it , Mr. Kyrle . "
203506	203510	203450	203450	he	240	" By whom ? "
203511	203515	203520	203520	He	240	" By me . "
203549	203555	203556	203556	he	240	" You are very determined , "
203559	203694	203556	203556	he	240	" You have , no doubt , a personal motive for proceeding , into which it is not my business to inquire . If a case can be produced in the future , I can only say , my best assistance is at your service . At the same time I must warn you , as the money question always enters into the law question , that I see little hope , even if you ultimately established the fact of Lady Glyde 's being alive , of recovering her fortune . The foreigner would probably leave the country before proceedings were commenced , and Sir Percival 's embarrassments are numerous enough and pressing enough to transfer almost any sum of money he may possess from himself to his creditors . You are of course aware "
203702	203716	203717	203717	I	0	" Let me beg that we may not discuss Lady Glyde 's affairs , "
203720	203778	203717	203717	I	0	" I have never known anything about them in former times , and I know nothing of them now except that her fortune is lost . You are right in assuming that I have personal motives for stirring in this matter . I wish those motives to be always as disinterested as they are at the present moment "
203815	203823	203824	203824	I	0	" There shall be no money motive , "
203827	203982	203824	203824	I	0	" no idea of personal advantage in the service I mean to render to Lady Glyde . She has been cast out as a stranger from the house in which she was born a lie which records her death has been written on her mother 's tomb and there are two men , alive and unpunished , who are responsible for it . That house shall open again to receive her in the presence of every soul who followed the false funeral to the grave that lie shall be publicly erased from the tombstone by the authority of the head of the family , and those two men shall answer for their crime to ME , though the justice that sits in tribunals is powerless to pursue them . I have given my life to that purpose , and , alone as I stand , if God spares me , I will accomplish it . "
204025	204035	204036	204036	I	0	" We each keep our opinion , Mr. Kyrle , "
204039	204123	204036	204036	I	0	" and we must wait till the events of the future decide between us . In the meantime , I am much obliged to you for the attention you have given to my statement . You have shown me that the legal remedy lies , in every sense of the word , beyond our means . We can not produce the law proof , and we are not rich enough to pay the law expenses . It is something gained to know that . "
204159	204169	204170	204170	he	5274	" This came by post a few days ago , "
204173	204227	204170	204170	he	5274	" Perhaps you will not mind delivering it ? Pray tell Miss Halcombe , at the same time , that I sincerely regret being , thus far , unable to help her , except by advice , which will not be more welcome , I am afraid , to her than to you . "
204242	204255	204234	204234	he	5274	" Miss Halcombe . Care of Messrs. Gilmore Kyrle , Chancery Lane . "
204274	204281	204282	204282	I	0	" Do you happen to know , "
204285	204295	204282	204282	I	0	" if Sir Percival Glyde is still in Paris ? "
204296	204303	204305	204306	Mr. Kyrle	240	" He has returned to London , "
204308	204323	204305	204306	Mr. Kyrle	240	" At least I heard so from his solicitor , whom I met yesterday . "
204976	204982	204983	204983	she	150	" Bad news , Walter , "
204986	205002	204983	204983	she	150	" the worst news you could bring . Have you nothing more to tell me ? "
205003	205011	205012	205012	I	0	" I have something to give you , "
205039	205045	205046	205046	I	0	" You know your correspondent ? "
205049	205053	205054	205054	she	150	" Too well , "
205057	205064	205054	205054	she	150	" My correspondent is Count Fosco . "
205103	205132	205087	205087	she	150	" Impelled by honourable admiration honourable to myself , honourable to you I write , magnificent Marian , in the interests of your tranquillity , to say two consoling words
205133	205136	205087	205087	she	150	" Fear nothing !
205137	205194	205087	205087	she	150	" Exercise your fine natural sense and remain in retirement . Dear and admirable woman , invite no dangerous publicity . Resignation is sublime adopt it . The modest repose of home is eternally fresh enjoy it . The storms of life pass harmless over the valley of Seclusion dwell , dear lady , in the valley .
205195	205258	205087	205087	she	150	" Do this and I authorise you to fear nothing . No new calamity shall lacerate your sensibilities sensibilities precious to me as my own . You shall not be molested , the fair companion of your retreat shall not be pursued . She has found a new asylum in your heart . Priceless asylum ! I envy her and leave her there .
205259	205286	205087	205087	she	150	" One last word of affectionate warning , of paternal caution , and I tear myself from the charm of addressing you I close these fervent lines .
205287	205406	205087	205087	she	150	" Advance no farther than you have gone already , compromise no serious interests , threaten nobody . Do not , I implore you , force me into action ME , the Man of Action when it is the cherished object of my ambition to be passive , to restrict the vast reach of my energies and my combinations for your sake . If you have rash friends , moderate their deplorable ardour . If Mr. Hartright returns to England , hold no communication with him . I walk on a path of my own , and Percival follows at my heels . On the day when Mr. Hartright crosses that path , he is a lost man . "
205444	205460	205461	205461	I	0	" He is trying to frighten you a sure sign that he is frightened himself , "
205528	205531	205532	205532	she	5310	" Walter ! "
205535	205565	205532	205532	she	5310	" if ever those two men are at your mercy , and if you are obliged to spare one of them , do n't let it be the Count . "
205566	205584	205585	205585	She	5310	" I will keep this letter , Marian , to help my memory when the time comes . "
205602	205608	205609	205609	she	5310	" When the time comes ? "
205612	205649	205609	205609	she	5310	" Can you speak of the future as if you were certain of it ? certain after what you have heard in Mr. Kyrle 's office , after what has happened to you to - day ? "
205650	205687	205585	205585	She	5310	" I do n't count the time from to - day , Marian . All I have done to - day is to ask another man to act for me . I count from to - morrow "
205688	205695	205609	205609	she	5310	" Why from to - morrow ? "
205696	205708	205585	205585	She	5310	" Because to - morrow I mean to act for myself . "
205709	205712	205609	205609	she	5310	" How ? "
205713	205733	205585	205585	She	5310	" I shall go to Blackwater by the first train , and return , I hope , at night . "
205734	205738	205609	205609	she	5310	" To Blackwater ! "
205739	205809	205585	205585	She	5310	" Yes . I have had time to think since I left Mr. Kyrle . His opinion on one point confirms my own . We must persist to the last in hunting down the date of Laura 's journey . The one weak point in the conspiracy , and probably the one chance of proving that she is a living woman , centre in the discovery of that date . "
205810	205814	205816	205816	Marian	150	" You mean , "
205818	205841	205816	205816	Marian	150	" the discovery that Laura did not leave Blackwater Park till after the date of her death on the doctor 's certificate ? "
205842	205845	205585	205585	She	5310	" Certainly . "
205846	205870	205816	205816	Marian	150	" What makes you think it might have been AFTER ? Laura can tell us nothing of the time she was in London . "
205871	205976	205585	205585	She	5310	" But the owner of the Asylum told you that she was received there on the twenty - seventh of July . I doubt Count Fosco 's ability to keep her in London , and to keep her insensible to all that was passing around her , more than one night . In that case , she must have started on the twenty - sixth , and must have come to London one day after the date of her own death on the doctor 's certificate . If we can prove that date , we prove our case against Sir Percival and the Count . "
205977	205993	205816	205816	Marian	150	" Yes , yes I see ! But how is the proof to be obtained ? "
205994	206107	205585	205585	She	5310	" Mrs. Michelson 's narrative has suggested to me two ways of trying to obtain it . One of them is to question the doctor , Mr. Dawson , who must know when he resumed his attendance at Blackwater Park after Laura left the house . The other is to make inquiries at the inn to which Sir Percival drove away by himself at night . We know that his departure followed Laura 's after the lapse of a few hours , and we may get at the date in that way . The attempt is at least worth making , and to - morrow I am determined it shall be made . "
206108	206144	205816	205816	Marian	150	" And suppose it fails I look at the worst now , Walter ; but I will look at the best if disappointments come to try us suppose no one can help you at Blackwater ? "
206145	206208	205585	205585	She	5310	" There are two men who can help me , and shall help me in London Sir Percival and the Count . Innocent people may well forget the date but THEY are guilty , and THEY know it . If I fail everywhere else , I mean to force a confession out of one or both of them on my own terms . "
206222	206228	206229	206229	she	150	" Begin with the Count , "
206233	206243	206229	206229	she	150	" For my sake , begin with the Count . "
206244	206263	206264	206264	I	0	" We must begin , for Laura 's sake , where there is the best chance of success , "
206282	206285	206286	206286	she	150	" Yes , "
206289	206350	206286	206286	she	150	" you are right it was mean and miserable of me to say that . I try to be patient , Walter , and succeed better now than I did in happier times . But I have a little of my old temper still left , and it will get the better of me when I think of the Count ! "
206351	206357	206358	206358	I	0	" His turn will come , "
206361	206380	206358	206358	I	0	" But , remember , there is no weak place in his life that we know of yet . "
206400	206417	206381	206381	I	0	" Marian ! There is a weak place we both know of in Sir Percival 's life "
206418	206424	206381	206381	I	0	" You mean the Secret ! "
206425	206529	206381	206381	I	0	" Yes : the Secret . It is our only sure hold on him . I can force him from his position of security , I can drag him and his villainy into the face of day , by no other means . Whatever the Count may have done , Sir Percival has consented to the conspiracy against Laura from another motive besides the motive of gain . You heard him tell the Count that he believed his wife knew enough to ruin him ? You heard him say that he was a lost man if the secret of Anne Catherick was known ? "
206530	206538	206381	206381	I	0	" Yes ! yes ! I did . "
206539	206611	206381	206381	I	0	" Well , Marian , when our other resources have failed us , I mean to know the Secret . My old superstition clings to me , even yet . I say again the woman in white is a living influence in our three lives . The End is appointed the End is drawing us on and Anne Catherick , dead in her grave , points the way to it still ! "

212998	213009	213011	213012	Mrs. Clements	180	" There 's no great merit in that , sir , "
213015	213132	213011	213012	Mrs. Clements	180	" The poor thing was as good as my own child to me . I nursed her from a baby , sir , bringing her up by hand and a hard job it was to rear her . It would n't go to my heart so to lose her if I had n't made her first short clothes and taught her to walk . I always said she was sent to console me for never having chick or child of my own . And now she 's lost the old times keep coming back to my mind , and even at my age I ca n't help crying about her I ca n't indeed , sir ! "
213177	213188	213189	213189	I	0	" Did you know Mrs. Catherick before Anne was born ? "
213192	213223	213224	213224	Her	180	" Not very long , sir not above four months . We saw a great deal of each other in that time , but we were never very friendly together . "
213278	213286	213287	213287	I	0	" Were you and Mrs. Catherick neighbours ? "
213300	213309	213287	213287	I	0	" Yes , sir neighbours at Old Welmingham . "
213310	213327	213287	213287	I	0	" OLD Welmingham ? There are two places of that name , then , in Hampshire ? "
213328	213442	213287	213287	I	0	" Well , sir , there used to be in those days better than three - and - twenty years ago . They built a new town about two miles off , convenient to the river and Old Welmingham , which was never much more than a village , got in time to be deserted . The new town is the place they call Welmingham now but the old parish church is the parish church still . It stands by itself , with the houses pulled down or gone to ruin all round it . I 've lived to see sad changes . It was a pleasant , pretty place in my time . "
213443	213455	213287	213287	I	0	" Did you live there before your marriage , Mrs. Clements ? "
213456	213586	213287	213287	I	0	" No , sir I 'm a Norfolk woman . It was n't the place my husband belonged to either . He was from Grimsby , as I told you , and he served his apprenticeship there . But having friends down south , and hearing of an opening , he got into business at Southampton . It was in a small way , but he made enough for a plain man to retire on , and settled at Old Welmingham . I went there with him when he married me . We were neither of us young , but we lived very happy together happier than our neighbour , Mr. Catherick , lived along with his wife when they came to Old Welmingham a year or two afterwards . "
213587	213597	213287	213287	I	0	" Was your husband acquainted with them before that ? "
213598	213968	213287	213287	I	0	" With Catherick , sir not with his wife . She was a stranger to both of us . Some gentlemen had made interest for Catherick , and he got the situation of clerk at Welmingham church , which was the reason of his coming to settle in our neighbourhood . He brought his newly - married wife along with him , and we heard in course of time she had been lady's - maid in a family that lived at Varneck Hall , near Southampton . Catherick had found it a hard matter to get her to marry him , in consequence of her holding herself uncommonly high . He had asked and asked , and given the thing up at last , seeing she was so contrary about it . When he HAD given it up she turned contrary just the other way , and came to him of her own accord , without rhyme or reason seemingly . My poor husband always said that was the time to have given her a lesson . But Catherick was too fond of her to do anything of the sort he never checked her either before they were married or after . He was a quick man in his feelings , letting them carry him a deal too far , now in one way and now in another , and he would have spoilt a better wife than Mrs. Catherick if a better had married him . I do n't like to speak ill of any one , sir , but she was a heartless woman , with a terrible will of her own fond of foolish admiration and fine clothes , and not caring to show so much as decent outward respect to Catherick , kindly as he always treated her . My husband said he thought things would turn out badly when they first came to live near us , and his words proved true . Before they had been quite four months in our neighbourhood there was a dreadful scandal and a miserable break - up in their household . Both of them were in fault I am afraid both of them were equally in fault . "
213969	213977	213287	213287	I	0	" You mean both husband and wife ? "
213978	214004	213287	213287	I	0	" Oh , no , sir ! I do n't mean Catherick he was only to be pitied . I meant his wife and the person "
214005	214014	213287	213287	I	0	" And the person who caused the scandal ? "
214015	214052	213287	213287	I	0	" Yes , sir . A gentleman born and brought up , who ought to have set a better example . You know him , sir and my poor dear Anne knew him only too well . "
214053	214058	213287	213287	I	0	" Sir Percival Glyde ? "
214059	214066	213287	213287	I	0	" Yes , Sir Percival Glyde . "
214099	214111	214112	214112	I	0	" Did Sir Percival live in your neighbourhood at that time ? "
214115	214203	213287	213287	I	0	" No , sir . He came among us as a stranger . His father had died not long before in foreign parts . I remember he was in mourning . He put up at the little inn on the river they have pulled it down since that time , where gentlemen used to go to fish . He was n't much noticed when he first came it was a common thing enough for gentlemen to travel from all parts of England to fish in our river . "
214204	214218	213287	213287	I	0	" Did he make his appearance in the village before Anne was born ? "
214219	214253	213287	213287	I	0	" Yes , sir . Anne was born in the June month of eighteen hundred and twenty - seven and I think he came at the end of April or the beginning of May. "
214254	214279	213287	213287	I	0	" Came as a stranger to all of you ? A stranger to Mrs. Catherick as well as to the rest of the neighbours ? "
214280	214800	213287	213287	I	0	" So we thought at first , sir . But when the scandal broke out , nobody believed they were strangers . I remember how it happened as well as if it was yesterday . Catherick came into our garden one night , and woke us by throwing up a handful of gravel from the walk at our window . I heard him beg my husband , for the Lord 's sake , to come down and speak to him . They were a long time together talking in the porch . When my husband came back upstairs he was all of a tremble . He sat down on the side of the bed and he says to me , ' Lizzie ! I always told you that woman was a bad one I always said she would end ill , and I 'm afraid in my own mind that the end has come already . Catherick has found a lot of lace handkerchiefs , and two fine rings , and a new gold watch and chain , hid away in his wife 's drawer things that nobody but a born lady ought ever to have and his wife wo n't say how she came by them . ' ' Does he think she stole them ? ' says I. ' No , ' says he , ' stealing would be bad enough . But it 's worse than that , she 's had no chance of stealing such things as those , and she 's not a woman to take them if she had . They 're gifts , Lizzie there 's her own initials engraved inside the watch and Catherick has seen her talking privately , and carrying on as no married woman should , with that gentleman in mourning , Sir Percival Glyde . Do n't you say anything about it I 've quieted Catherick for to - night . I 've told him to keep his tongue to himself , and his eyes and his ears open , and to wait a day or two , till he can be quite certain . ' ' I believe you are both of you wrong , ' says I. ' It 's not in nature , comfortable and respectable as she is here , that Mrs. Catherick should take up with a chance stranger like Sir Percival Glyde . ' ' Ay , but is he a stranger to her ? ' says my husband . ' You forget how Catherick 's wife came to marry him . She went to him of her own accord , after saying No over and over again when he asked her . There have been wicked women before her time , Lizzie , who have used honest men who loved them as a means of saving their characters , and I 'm sorely afraid this Mrs. Catherick is as wicked as the worst of them . We shall see , ' says my husband , ' we shall soon see . ' And only two days afterwards we did see . "
214878	214892	214893	214894	Mrs. Clements	180	" Well , sir , Catherick took my husband 's advice and waited , "
214897	215278	214893	214894	Mrs. Clements	180	" And as I told you , he had n't long to wait . On the second day he found his wife and Sir Percival whispering together quite familiar , close under the vestry of the church . I suppose they thought the neighbourhood of the vestry was the last place in the world where anybody would think of looking after them , but , however that may be , there they were . Sir Percival , being seemingly surprised and confounded , defended himself in such a guilty way that poor Catherick whose quick temper I have told you of already fell into a kind of frenzy at his own disgrace , and struck Sir Percival . He was no match and I am sorry to say it for the man who had wronged him , and he was beaten in the cruelest manner , before the neighbours , who had come to the place on hearing the disturbance , could run in to part them . All this happened towards evening , and before nightfall , when my husband went to Catherick 's house , he was gone , nobody knew where . No living soul in the village ever saw him again . He knew too well , by that time , what his wife 's vile reason had been for marrying him , and he felt his misery and disgrace , especially after what had happened to him with Sir Percival , too keenly . The clergyman of the parish put an advertisement in the paper begging him to come back , and saying that he should not lose his situation or his friends . But Catherick had too much pride and spirit , as some people said too much feeling , as I think , sir to face his neighbours again , and try to live down the memory of his disgrace . My husband heard from him when he had left England , and heard a second time , when he was settled and doing well in America . He is alive there now , as far as I know , but none of us in the old country his wicked wife least of all are ever likely to set eyes on him again . "
215279	215286	215287	215287	I	0	" What became of Sir Percival ? "
215290	215298	215287	215287	I	0	" Did he stay in the neighbourhood ? "
215299	215341	214893	214894	Mrs. Clements	180	" Not he , sir . The place was too hot to hold him . He was heard at high words with Mrs. Catherick the same night when the scandal broke out , and the next morning he took himself off . "
215342	215363	215287	215287	I	0	" And Mrs. Catherick ? Surely she never remained in the village among the people who knew of her disgrace ? "
215364	215511	214893	214894	Mrs. Clements	180	" She did , sir . She was hard enough and heartless enough to set the opinions of all her neighbours at flat defiance . She declared to everybody , from the clergyman downwards , that she was the victim of a dreadful mistake , and that all the scandal - mongers in the place should not drive her out of it , as if she was a guilty woman . All through my time she lived at Old Welmingham , and after my time , when the new town was building , and the respectable neighbours began moving to it , she moved too , as if she was determined to live among them and scandalise them to the very last . There she is now , and there she will stop , in defiance of the best of them , to her dying day . "
215512	215523	215524	215524	I	0	" But how has she lived through all these years ? "
215527	215538	215524	215524	I	0	" Was her husband able and willing to help her ? "
215539	215547	215549	215550	Mrs. Clements	180	" Both able and willing , sir , "
215552	215619	215549	215550	Mrs. Clements	180	" In the second letter he wrote to my good man , he said she had borne his name , and lived in his home , and , wicked as she was , she must not starve like a beggar in the street . He could afford to make her some small allowance , and she might draw for it quarterly at a place in London . "
215620	215627	214893	214894	Mrs. Clements	180	" Did she accept the allowance ? "
215628	215760	215549	215550	Mrs. Clements	180	" Not a farthing of it , sir . She said she would never be beholden to Catherick for bit or drop , if she lived to be a hundred . And she has kept her word ever since . When my poor dear husband died , and left all to me , Catherick 's letter was put in my possession with the other things , and I told her to let me know if she was ever in want . ' I 'll let all England know I 'm in want , ' she said , ' before I tell Catherick , or any friend of Catherick 's . Take that for your answer , and give it to HIM for an answer , if he ever writes again . ' "
215761	215773	214893	214894	Mrs. Clements	180	" Do you suppose that she had money of her own ? "
215774	215807	215549	215550	Mrs. Clements	180	" Very little , if any , sir . It was said , and said truly , I am afraid , that her means of living came privately from Sir Percival Glyde . "
216299	216305	216294	216295	the clerk	5613	" the gentleman in mourning , "
216618	216633	216634	216634	I	0	" I suppose you often saw Sir Percival when he was in your village ? "
216637	216645	216647	216648	Mrs. Clements	180	" Yes , sir , very often , "
216650	216661	216647	216648	Mrs. Clements	180	" Did you ever observe that Anne was like him ? "
216662	216673	216707	216708	her mother	413	" She was not at all like him , sir . "
216674	216683	216647	216648	Mrs. Clements	180	" Was she like her mother , then ? "
216684	216704	216707	216708	her mother	413	" Not like her mother either , sir . Mrs. Catherick was dark , and full in the face . "
216795	216805	216806	216806	I	0	" When Sir Percival first arrived in your neighbourhood , "
216809	216820	216806	216806	I	0	" did you hear where he had come from last ? "
216821	216841	216788	216788	I	0	" No , sir . Some said from Blackwater Park , and some said from Scotland but nobody knew . "
216842	216857	216806	216806	I	0	" Was Mrs. Catherick living in service at Varneck Hall immediately before her marriage ? "
216858	216863	216788	216788	I	0	" Yes , sir . "
216864	216874	216806	216806	I	0	" And had she been long in her place ? "
216875	216890	216788	216788	I	0	" Three or four years , sir ; I am not quite certain which . "
216891	216910	216806	216806	I	0	" Did you ever hear the name of the gentleman to whom Varneck Hall belonged at that time ? "
216911	216922	216788	216788	I	0	" Yes , sir . His name was Major Donthorne . "
216923	216961	216806	216806	I	0	" Did Mr. Catherick , or did any one else you knew , ever hear that Sir Percival was a friend of Major Donthorne 's , or ever see Sir Percival in the neighbourhood of Varneck Hall ? "
216962	216984	216788	216788	I	0	" Catherick never did , sir , that I can remember nor any one else either , that I know of . "
217123	217130	217131	217131	I	0	" I have not heard yet , "
217134	217160	217131	217131	I	0	" how the poor child , born in all this sin and misery , came to be trusted , Mrs. Clements , to your care . "
217161	217178	217180	217181	Mrs. Clements	180	" There was nobody else , sir , to take the little helpless creature in hand , "
217183	217233	217180	217181	Mrs. Clements	180	" The wicked mother seemed to hate it as if the poor baby was in fault ! from the day it was born . My heart was heavy for the child , and I made the offer to bring it up as tenderly as if it was my own . "
217234	217246	217131	217131	I	0	" Did Anne remain entirely under your care from that time ? "
217247	217485	217180	217181	Mrs. Clements	180	" Not quite entirely , sir . Mrs. Catherick had her whims and fancies about it at times , and used now and then to lay claim to the child , as if she wanted to spite me for bringing it up . But these fits of hers never lasted for long . Poor little Anne was always returned to me , and was always glad to get back though she led but a gloomy life in my house , having no playmates , like other children , to brighten her up . Our longest separation was when her mother took her to Limmeridge . Just at that time I lost my husband , and I felt it was as well , in that miserable affliction , that Anne should not be in the house . She was between ten and eleven years old then , slow at her lessons , poor soul , and not so cheerful as other children but as pretty a little girl to look at as you would wish to see . I waited at home till her mother brought her back , and then I made the offer to take her with me to London the truth being , sir , that I could not find it in my heart to stop at Old Welmingham after my husband 's death , the place was so changed and so dismal to me . "
217486	217496	217131	217131	I	0	" And did Mrs. Catherick consent to your proposal ? "
217497	217666	217180	217181	Mrs. Clements	180	" No , sir . She came back from the north harder and bitterer than ever . Folks did say that she had been obliged to ask Sir Percival 's leave to go , to begin with ; and that she only went to nurse her dying sister at Limmeridge because the poor woman was reported to have saved money the truth being that she hardly left enough to bury her . These things may have soured Mrs. Catherick likely enough , but however that may be , she would n't hear of my taking the child away . She seemed to like distressing us both by parting us . All I could do was to give Anne my direction , and to tell her privately , if she was ever in trouble , to come to me . But years passed before she was free to come . I never saw her again , poor soul , till the night she escaped from the mad - house . "
217667	217682	217131	217131	I	0	" You know , Mrs. Clements , why Sir Percival Glyde shut her up ? "
217683	217839	217180	217181	Mrs. Clements	180	" I only know what Anne herself told me , sir . The poor thing used to ramble and wander about it sadly . She said her mother had got some secret of Sir Percival 's to keep , and had let it out to her long after I left Hampshire and when Sir Percival found she knew it , he shut her up . But she never could say what it was when I asked her . All she could tell me was , that her mother might be the ruin and destruction of Sir Percival if she chose . Mrs. Catherick may have let out just as much as that , and no more . I 'm next to certain I should have heard the whole truth from Anne , if she had really known it as she pretended to do , and as she very likely fancied she did , poor soul . "
218090	218102	218103	218103	I	0	" I am afraid you must have thought me very inquisitive , "
218106	218123	218103	218103	I	0	" I have troubled you with more questions than many people would have cared to answer . "
218124	218139	218141	218142	Mrs. Clements	180	" You are heartily welcome , sir , to anything I can tell you , "
218152	218158	218160	218162	the poor woman	1201	" But I do wish , "
218164	218258	218160	218162	the poor woman	1201	" you could have told me a little more about Anne , sir . I thought I saw something in your face when you came in which looked as if you could . You ca n't think how hard it is not even to know whether she is living or dead . I could bear it better if I was only certain . You said you never expected we should see her alive again . Do you know , sir do you know for truth that it has pleased God to take her ? "
218283	218295	218296	218296	I	0	" I am afraid there is no doubt of the truth , "
218300	218318	218296	218296	I	0	" I have the certainty in my own mind that her troubles in this world are over . "
218333	218338	218339	218339	she	1201	" Oh , sir , "
218342	218355	218339	218339	she	1201	" how do you know it ? Who can have told you ? "
218356	218466	218319	218321	The poor woman	1201	" No one has told me , Mrs. Clements . But I have reasons for feeling sure of it reasons which I promise you shall know as soon as I can safely explain them . I am certain she was not neglected in her last moments I am certain the heart complaint from which she suffered so sadly was the true cause of her death . You shall feel as sure of this as I do , soon you shall know , before long , that she is buried in a quiet country churchyard in a pretty , peaceful place , which you might have chosen for her yourself . "
218467	218470	218472	218473	Mrs. Clements	180	" Dead ! "
218475	218529	218531	218533	the poor woman	1201	" dead so young , and I am left to hear it ! I made her first short frocks . I taught her to walk . The first time she ever said Mother she said it to me and now I am left and Anne is taken ! Did you say , sir , "
218552	218582	218531	218533	the poor woman	1201	" did you say that she had been nicely buried ? Was it the sort of funeral she might have had if she had really been my own child ? "
218615	218623	218624	218624	she	1201	" It would have broken my heart , "
218628	218649	218624	218624	she	1201	" if Anne had not been nicely buried but how do you know it , sir ? who told you ? "
218665	218674	218675	218675	I	0	" You are sure to see me again , "
218678	218700	218675	218675	I	0	" for I have a favour to ask when you are a little more composed perhaps in a day or two . "
218701	218714	218716	218717	Mrs. Clements	180	" Do n't keep it waiting , sir , on my account , "
218719	218751	218716	218717	Mrs. Clements	180	" Never mind my crying if I can be of use . If you have anything on your mind to say to me , sir , please to say it now . "
218752	218763	218764	218764	I	0	" I only wish to ask you one last question , "
218767	218780	218764	218764	I	0	" I only want to know Mrs. Catherick 's address at Welmingham . "
218826	218835	218836	218836	she	180	" For the Lord 's sake , sir ! "
218839	218848	218836	218836	she	180	" what do you want with Mrs. Catherick ! "
218849	218857	218858	218858	I	0	" I want this , Mrs. Clements , "
218861	218944	218858	218858	I	0	" I want to know the secret of those private meetings of hers with Sir Percival Glyde . There is something more in what you have told me of that woman 's past conduct , and of that man 's past relations with her , than you or any of your neighbours ever suspected . There is a secret we none of us know between those two , and I am going to Mrs. Catherick with the resolution to find it out . "
218945	218953	218955	218956	Mrs. Clements	180	" Think twice about it , sir ! "
218970	218990	218955	218956	Mrs. Clements	180	" She 's an awful woman you do n't know her as I do . Think twice about it . "
218991	219018	219019	219020	Mrs. Clements	180	" I am sure your warning is kindly meant , Mrs. Clements . But I am determined to see the woman , whatever comes of it . "
219028	219039	219040	219040	she	180	" I see your mind is made up , sir , "
219043	219051	219040	219040	she	180	" I will give you the address . "
219070	219078	219079	219079	I	0	" You shall hear from me soon , "
219082	219095	219079	219079	I	0	" you shall know all that I have promised to tell you . "
219105	219118	219119	219119	she	180	" An old woman 's advice is sometimes worth taking , sir , "
219122	219131	219119	219119	she	180	" Think twice before you go to Welmingham . "
219259	219267	219247	219247	Laura	163	" Try if you can rouse her , "
219298	219320	219273	219273	I	0	" What are you thinking of , Laura ? Tell me , my darling try and tell me what it is . "
219333	219340	219341	219341	she	163	" I ca n't feel happy , "
219344	219350	219341	219341	she	163	" I ca n't help thinking "
219379	219385	219386	219386	I	0	" Try to tell me , "
219390	219401	219386	219386	I	0	" try to tell me why you are not happy . "
219402	219417	219418	219418	she	163	" I am so useless I am such a burden on both of you , "
219428	219486	219418	219418	she	163	" You work and get money , Walter , and Marian helps you . Why is there nothing I can do ? You will end in liking Marian better than you like me you will , because I am so helpless ! Oh , do n't , do n't , do n't treat me like a child ! "
219519	219527	219528	219528	I	0	" You shall help us , Laura , "
219531	219543	219528	219528	I	0	" you shall begin , my darling , to - day . "
219597	219609	219610	219610	I	0	" You know that I work and get money by drawing , "
219613	219737	219610	219610	I	0	" Now you have taken such pains , now you are so much improved , you shall begin to work and get money too . Try to finish this little sketch as nicely and prettily as you can . When it is done I will take it away with me , and the same person will buy it who buys all that I do . You shall keep your own earnings in your own purse , and Marian shall come to you to help us , as often as she comes to me . Think how useful you are going to make yourself to both of us , and you will soon be as happy , Laura , as the day is long . "
220195	220200	220201	220201	she	150	" Surely , Walter , "
220204	220324	220201	220201	she	150	" you hardly know enough yet to give you any hope of claiming Mrs. Catherick 's confidence ? Is it wise to proceed to these extremities , before you have really exhausted all safer and simpler means of attaining your object ? When you told me that Sir Percival and the Count were the only two people in existence who knew the exact date of Laura 's journey , you forgot , and I forgot , that there was a third person who must surely know it I mean Mrs. Rubelle . Would it not be far easier , and far less dangerous , to insist on a confession from her , than to force it from Sir Percival ? "
220325	220331	220332	220332	I	0	" It might be easier , "
220335	220466	220332	220332	I	0	" but we are not aware of the full extent of Mrs. Rubelle 's connivance and interest in the conspiracy , and we are therefore not certain that the date has been impressed on her mind , as it has been assuredly impressed on the minds of Sir Percival and the Count . It is too late , now , to waste the time on Mrs. Rubelle , which may be all - important to the discovery of the one assailable point in Sir Percival 's life . Are you thinking a little too seriously , Marian , of the risk I may run in returning to Hampshire ? Are you beginning to doubt whether Sir Percival Glyde may not in the end be more than a match for me ? "
220467	220477	220478	220478	she	5668	" He will not be more than your match , "
220482	220500	220478	220478	she	5668	" because he will not be helped in resisting you by the impenetrable wickedness of the Count . "
220501	220510	220511	220511	I	0	" What has led you to that conclusion ? "
220518	220535	220536	220536	she	5668	" My own knowledge of Sir Percival 's obstinacy and impatience of the Count 's control , "
220539	220610	220536	220536	she	5668	" I believe he will insist on meeting you single - handed just as he insisted at first on acting for himself at Blackwater Park . The time for suspecting the Count 's interference will be the time when you have Sir Percival at your mercy . His own interests will then be directly threatened , and he will act , Walter , to terrible purpose in his own defence . "
220611	220621	220622	220622	I	0	" We may deprive him of his weapons beforehand , "
220625	220779	220622	220622	I	0	" Some of the particulars I have heard from Mrs. Clements may yet be turned to account against him , and other means of strengthening the case may be at our disposal . There are passages in Mrs. Michelson 's narrative which show that the Count found it necessary to place himself in communication with Mr. Fairlie , and there may be circumstances which compromise him in that proceeding . While I am away , Marian , write to Mr. Fairlie and say that you want an answer describing exactly what passed between the Count and himself , and informing you also of any particulars that may have come to his knowledge at the same time in connection with his niece . Tell him that the statement you request will , sooner or later , be insisted on , if he shows any reluctance to furnish you with it of his own accord . "
220780	220799	220536	220536	she	5668	" The letter shall be written , Walter . But are you really determined to go to Welmingham ? "
220800	220832	220622	220622	I	0	" Absolutely determined . I will devote the next two days to earning what we want for the week to come , and on the third day I go to Hampshire . "
220977	220986	220987	220987	she	150	" Remember what anxious hearts you leave here , "
220998	221025	220987	220987	she	150	" Remember all the hopes that hang on your safe return . If strange things happen to you on this journey if you and Sir Percival meet "
221026	221035	221036	221036	I	0	" What makes you think we shall meet ? "
221039	221084	220987	220987	she	150	" I do n't know I have fears and fancies that I can not account for . Laugh at them , Walter , if you like but , for God 's sake , keep your temper if you come in contact with that man ! "
221085	221099	220987	220987	she	150	" Never fear , Marian ! I answer for my self - control . "
221858	221875	221876	221876	I	0	" Say , if you please , that my business relates to Mrs. Catherick 's daughter , "
222130	222142	222143	222143	she	1106	" You have come to speak to me about my daughter , "
222156	222169	222143	222143	she	1106	" Be so good as to mention what you have to say . "
222252	222257	222258	222258	I	0	" You are aware , "
222261	222269	222258	222258	I	0	" that your daughter has been lost ? "
222270	222278	222326	222326	She	582	" I am perfectly aware of it . "
222279	222301	222258	222258	I	0	" Have you felt any apprehension that the misfortune of her loss might be followed by the misfortune of her death ? "
222302	222316	222326	222326	She	582	" Yes . Have you come here to tell me she is dead ? "
222317	222321	222258	222258	I	0	" I have . "
222322	222325	222326	222326	She	582	" Why ? "
222370	222373	222374	222374	I	0	" Why ? "
222377	222394	222374	222374	I	0	" Do you ask why I come here to tell you of your daughter 's death ? "
222395	222420	222326	222326	She	582	" Yes . What interest have you in me , or in her ? How do you come to know anything about my daughter ? "
222421	222450	222374	222374	I	0	" In this way . I met her on the night when she escaped from the Asylum , and I assisted her in reaching a place of safety . "
222451	222457	222326	222326	She	582	" You did very wrong . "
222458	222469	222374	222374	I	0	" I am sorry to hear her mother say so . "
222470	222485	222326	222326	She	582	" Her mother does say so . How do you know she is dead ? "
222486	222504	222374	222374	I	0	" I am not at liberty to say how I know it but I DO know it . "
222505	222519	222326	222326	She	582	" Are you at liberty to say how you found out my address ? "
222520	222531	222374	222374	I	0	" Certainly . I got your address from Mrs. Clements . "
222532	222548	222326	222326	She	582	" Mrs. Clements is a foolish woman . Did she tell you to come here ? "
222549	222554	222374	222374	I	0	" She did not . "
222555	222568	222326	222326	She	582	" Then , I ask you again , why did you come ? "
222589	222593	222594	222594	I	0	" I came , "
222597	222619	222594	222594	I	0	" because I thought Anne Catherick 's mother might have some natural interest in knowing whether she was alive or dead . "
222620	222624	222626	222627	Mrs. Catherick	165	" Just so , "
222635	222642	222626	222627	Mrs. Catherick	165	" Had you no other motive ? "
222663	222671	222672	222672	she	165	" If you have no other motive , "
222690	222775	222672	222672	she	165	" I have only to thank you for your visit , and to say that I will not detain you here any longer . Your information would be more satisfactory if you were willing to explain how you became possessed of it . However , it justifies me , I suppose , in going into mourning . There is not much alteration necessary in my dress , as you see . When I have changed my mittens , I shall be all in black . "
222814	222821	222822	222822	she	165	" I wish you good morning , "
222848	222857	222858	222858	I	0	" I HAVE another motive in coming here , "
222861	222868	222870	222871	Mrs. Catherick	165	" Ah ! I thought so , "
222873	222878	222829	222829	her	165	" Your daughter 's death "
222879	222886	222829	222829	her	165	" What did she die of ? "
222887	222894	222829	222829	her	165	" Of disease of the heart . "
222895	222901	222829	222829	her	165	" Yes . Go on . "
222902	222950	222829	222829	her	165	" Your daughter 's death has been made the pretext for inflicting serious injury on a person who is very dear to me . Two men have been concerned , to my certain knowledge , in doing that wrong . One of them is Sir Percival Glyde . "
222951	222954	222829	222829	her	165	" Indeed ! "
222993	222998	222999	222999	I	0	" You may wonder , "
223003	223025	222999	222999	I	0	" how the event of your daughter 's death can have been made the means of inflicting injury on another person . "
223026	223029	223031	223032	Mrs. Catherick	165	" No , "
223034	223063	223031	223032	Mrs. Catherick	165	" I do n't wonder at all . This appears to be your affair . You are interested in my affairs . I am not interested in yours . "
223064	223071	223072	223072	I	0	" You may ask , then , "
223075	223085	223072	223072	I	0	" why I mention the matter in your presence . "
223086	223094	223031	223032	Mrs. Catherick	165	" Yes , I DO ask that . "
223095	223117	223072	223072	I	0	" I mention it because I am determined to bring Sir Percival Glyde to account for the wickedness he has committed . "
223118	223128	223031	223032	Mrs. Catherick	165	" What have I to do with your determination ? "
223129	223169	223072	223072	I	0	" You shall hear . There are certain events in Sir Percival 's past life which it is necessary for my purpose to be fully acquainted with . YOU know them and for that reason I come to YOU . "
223170	223177	223031	223032	Mrs. Catherick	165	" What events do you mean ? "
223178	223206	223072	223072	I	0	" Events that occurred at Old Welmingham when your husband was parish - clerk at that place , and before the time when your daughter was born . "
223262	223271	223272	223272	she	571	" What do you know of those events ? "
223275	223284	223285	223285	I	0	" All that Mrs. Clements could tell me , "
223366	223377	223378	223378	she	571	" Ah ! I begin to understand it all now , "
223399	223515	223378	223378	she	571	" You have got a grudge of your own against Sir Percival Glyde , and I must help you to wreak it . I must tell you this , that , and the other about Sir Percival and myself , must I ? Yes , indeed ? You have been prying into my private affairs . You think you have found a lost woman to deal with , who lives here on sufferance , and who will do anything you ask for fear you may injure her in the opinions of the town's - people . I see through you and your precious speculation I do ! and it amuses me . Ha ! ha ! "
223542	223571	223572	223572	she	5727	" You do n't know how I have lived in this place , and what I have done in this place , Mr. What's - your - name , "
223576	223943	223572	223572	she	5727	" I 'll tell you , before I ring the bell and have you shown out . I came here a wronged woman I came here robbed of my character and determined to claim it back . I 've been years and years about it and I HAVE claimed it back . I have matched the respectable people fairly and openly on their own ground . If they say anything against me now they must say it in secret they ca n't say it , they dare n't say it , openly . I stand high enough in this town to be out of your reach . THE CLERGYMAN BOWS TO ME . Aha ! you did n't bargain for that when you came here . Go to the church and inquire about me you will find Mrs. Catherick has her sitting like the rest of them , and pays the rent on the day it 's due . Go to the town - hall . There 's a petition lying there a petition of the respectable inhabitants against allowing a circus to come and perform here and corrupt our morals yes ! OUR morals . I signed that petition this morning . Go to the bookseller 's shop . The clergyman 's Wednesday evening Lectures on Justification by Faith are publishing there by subscription I 'm down on the list . The doctor 's wife only put a shilling in the plate at our last charity sermon I put half - a - crown . Mr. Churchwarden Soward held the plate , and bowed to me . Ten years ago he told Pigrum the chemist I ought to be whipped out of the town at the cart 's tail . Is your mother alive ? Has she got a better Bible on her table than I have got on mine ? Does she stand better with her trades - people than I do with mine ? Has she always lived within her income ? I have always lived within mine . Ah ! there IS the clergyman coming along the square . Look , Mr. What's - your - name look , if you please ! "
224001	224004	224005	224005	she	165	" There ! "
224008	224030	224005	224005	she	165	" What do you think of that for a woman with a lost character ? How does your speculation look now ? "
224126	224134	224135	224135	she	165	" How does your speculation look now ? "
224138	224149	224150	224150	I	0	" Exactly as it looked when I first came in , "
224153	224276	224150	224150	I	0	" I do n't doubt the position you have gained in the town , and I do n't wish to assail it even if I could . I came here because Sir Percival Glyde is , to my certain knowledge , your enemy , as well as mine . If I have a grudge against him , you have a grudge against him too . You may deny it if you like , you may distrust me as much as you please , you may be as angry as you will but , of all the women in England , you , if you have any sense of injury , are the woman who ought to help me to crush that man . "
224277	224283	224284	224284	she	5734	" Crush him for yourself , "
224287	224301	224284	224284	she	5734	" then come back here , and see what I say to you . "
224382	224389	224390	224390	I	0	" You wo n't trust me ? "
224393	224396	224390	224390	I	0	" No . "
224397	224402	224428	224428	Her	5734	" You are afraid ? "
224403	224412	224390	224390	I	0	" Do I look as if I was ? "
224413	224422	224428	224428	Her	5734	" You are afraid of Sir Percival Glyde ? "
224423	224427	224390	224390	I	0	" Am I ? "
224464	224475	224476	224476	I	0	" Sir Percival has a high position in the world , "
224479	224515	224476	224476	I	0	" it would be no wonder if you were afraid of him . Sir Percival is a powerful man , a baronet , the possessor of a fine estate , the descendant of a great family "
224527	224530	224531	224531	she	5734	" Yes , "
224543	224575	224531	224531	she	5734	" A baronet , the possessor of a fine estate , the descendant of a great family . Yes , indeed ! A great family especially by the mother 's side . "
224611	224624	224625	224625	I	0	" I am not here to dispute with you about family questions , "
224628	224637	224625	224625	I	0	" I know nothing of Sir Percival 's mother "
224638	224649	224650	224650	she	5734	" And you know as little of Sir Percival himself , "
224654	224666	224667	224667	I	0	" I advise you not to be too sure of that , "
224670	224684	224667	224667	I	0	" I know some things about him , and I suspect many more . "
224685	224691	224625	224625	I	0	" What do you suspect ? "
224692	224712	224667	224667	I	0	" I 'll tell you what I DON'T suspect . I DON'T suspect him of being Anne 's father . "
224731	224757	224758	224758	she	5734	" How dare you talk to me about Anne 's father ! How dare you say who was her father , or who was n't ! "
224772	224785	224786	224786	I	0	" The secret between you and Sir Percival is not THAT secret , "
224789	224817	224786	224786	I	0	" The mystery which darkens Sir Percival 's life was not born with your daughter 's birth , and has not died with your daughter 's death . "
224824	224827	224828	224828	she	5734	" Go ! "
224838	224853	224854	224854	I	0	" There was no thought of the child in your heart or in his , "
224868	224901	224854	224854	I	0	" There was no bond of guilty love between you and him when you held those stolen meetings , when your husband found you whispering together under the vestry of the church . "
224967	224974	224960	224960	I	0	" the vestry of the church . "
224993	225002	225003	225003	I	0	" Do you still refuse to trust me ? "
225044	225049	225050	225050	she	5734	" I do refuse , "
225053	225062	225022	225022	she	5734	" Do you still tell me to go ? "
225063	225072	225093	225093	her	5734	" Yes . Go and never come back . "
225096	225113	225114	225114	I	0	" I may have news to bring you of Sir Percival which you do n't expect , "

225128	225143	225144	225144	She	5734	" There is no news of Sir Percival that I do n't expect , except "
225170	225178	225179	225179	she	5734	" Except the news of his death , "
226347	226355	226322	226322	her	150	" The Post - Office , Welmingham , "
226582	226588	226590	226591	Mrs. Catherick	165	" the vestry of the church "
226849	226857	226834	226834	She	165	" especially by the mother 's side . "
227762	227773	227775	227777	the old man	5854	" It 's well you came so early , sir , "
227789	227866	227775	227777	the old man	5854	" I should have been away in ten minutes more . Parish business , sir , and a goodish long trot before it 's all done for a man at my age . But , bless you , I 'm strong on my legs still ! As long as a man do n't give at his legs , there 's a deal of work left in him . Do n't you think so yourself , sir ? "
227891	227901	227903	227904	the clerk	5613	" Nobody at home to keep house for me , "
227918	228046	227903	227904	the clerk	5613	" My wife 's in the churchyard there , and my children are all married . A wretched place this , is n't it , sir ? But the parish is a large one every man could n't get through the business as I do . It 's learning does it , and I 've had my share , and a little more . I can talk the Queen 's English God bless the Queen ! , and that 's more than most of the people about here can do . You 're from London , I suppose , sir ? I 've been in London a matter of five - and - twenty year ago . What 's the news there now , if you please ? "
228158	228170	228171	228171	he	5613	" I 'm obliged to bring you this way , sir , "
228174	228311	228171	228171	he	5613	" because the door from the vestry to the church is bolted on the vestry side . We might have got in through the church otherwise . This is a perverse lock , if ever there was one yet . It 's big enough for a prison - door it 's been hampered over and over again , and it ought to be changed for a new one . I 've mentioned that to the churchwarden fifty times over at least he 's always saying , ' I 'll see about it ' and he never does see . Ah , It 's a sort of lost corner , this place . Not like London is it , sir ? Bless you , we are all asleep here ! We do n't march with the times . "
228579	228591	228593	228595	the cheerful clerk	5875	" We might be tidier , might n't we , sir ? "
228597	228706	228593	228595	the cheerful clerk	5875	" but when you 're in a lost corner of a place like this , what are you to do ? Why , look here now , just look at these packing - cases . There they 've been , for a year or more , ready to go down to London there they are , littering the place , and there they 'll stop as long as the nails hold them together . I 'll tell you what , sir , as I said before , this is not London . We are all asleep here . Bless you , WE do n't march with the times ! "
228707	228717	228718	228718	I	0	" What is there in the packing - cases ? "
228721	228745	228747	228748	the clerk	5613	" Bits of old wood carvings from the pulpit , and panels from the chancel , and images from the organ - loft , "
228750	228801	228747	228748	the clerk	5613	" Portraits of the twelve apostles in wood , and not a whole nose among 'em . All broken , and worm - eaten , and crumbling to dust at the edges . As brittle as crockery , sir , and as old as the church , if not older . "
228802	228815	228593	228595	the cheerful clerk	5875	" And why were they going to London ? To be repaired ? "
228816	229099	228747	228748	the clerk	5613	" That 's it , sir , to be repaired , and where they were past repair , to be copied in sound wood . But , bless you , the money fell short , and there they are , waiting for new subscriptions , and nobody to subscribe . It was all done a year ago , sir . Six gentlemen dined together about it , at the hotel in the new town . They made speeches , and passed resolutions , and put their names down , and printed off thousands of prospectuses . Beautiful prospectuses , sir , all flourished over with Gothic devices in red ink , saying it was a disgrace not to restore the church and repair the famous carvings , and so on . There are the prospectuses that could n't be distributed , and the architect 's plans and estimates , and the whole correspondence which set everybody at loggerheads and ended in a dispute , all down together in that corner , behind the packing - cases . The money dribbled in a little at first but what CAN you expect out of London ? There was just enough , you know , to pack the broken carvings , and get the estimates , and pay the printer 's bill , and after that there was n't a halfpenny left . There the things are , as I said before . We have nowhere else to put them nobody in the new town cares about accommodating us we 're in a lost corner and this is an untidy vestry and who 's to help it ? that 's what I want to know . "
229149	229163	229165	229166	the clerk	5613	" Ay , ay , the marriage - register , to be sure , "
229178	229190	229165	229166	the clerk	5613	" How far do you want to look back , sir ? "
229280	229293	229294	229294	I	0	" I want to begin with the year eighteen hundred and four , "
229297	229305	229307	229308	the clerk	5613	" Which way after that , sir ? "
229310	229321	229307	229308	the clerk	5613	" Forwards to our time or backwards away from us ? "
229322	229330	229331	229331	He	168	" Backwards from eighteen hundred and four . "
229418	229430	229431	229431	I	0	" Is that considered a sufficiently secure place for the register ? "
229434	229460	229431	229431	I	0	" Surely a book of such importance as this ought to be protected by a better lock , and kept carefully in an iron safe ? "
229461	229470	229472	229473	the clerk	5613	" Well , now , that 's curious ! "
229497	229835	229490	229490	his	5613	" Those were the very words my old master was always saying years and years ago , when I was a lad . ' Why is n't the register ' meaning this register here , under my hand ' why is n't it kept in an iron safe ? ' If I 've heard him say that once , I 've heard him say it a hundred times . He was the solicitor in those days , sir , who had the appointment of vestry - clerk to this church . A fine hearty old gentleman , and the most particular man breathing . As long as he lived he kept a copy of this book in his office at Knowlesbury , and had it posted up regular , from time to time , to correspond with the fresh entries here . You would hardly think it , but he had his own appointed days , once or twice in every quarter , for riding over to this church on his old white pony , to check the copy , by the register , with his own eyes and hands . ' How do I know ? ' he used to say ' how do I know that the register in this vestry may not be stolen or destroyed ? Why is n't it kept in an iron safe ? Why ca n't I make other people as careful as I am myself ? Some of these days there will be an accident happen , and when the register 's lost , then the parish will find out the value of my copy . ' He used to take his pinch of snuff after that , and look about him as bold as a lord . Ah ! the like of him for doing business is n't easy to find now . You may go to London and not match him , even THERE . Which year did you say , sir ? Eighteen hundred and what ? "
229836	229842	229843	229843	I	0	" Eighteen hundred and four , "
229895	229902	229904	229904	he	5613	" There it is , sir , "
229915	229923	229904	229904	he	5613	" There 's the year you want . "
230200	230228	230196	230196	She	8436	" Cecilia Jane Elster , of Park - View Cottages , Knowlesbury , only daughter of the late Patrick Elster , Esq . , formerly of Bath . "
230369	230375	230417	230418	the clerk	5613	" Miss Elster of Knowlesbury , "
230405	230415	230417	230418	the clerk	5613	" Have you found what you wanted , sir ? "
230428	230431	230432	230432	I	0	" Yes , "
230435	230464	230432	230432	I	0	" but I have some inquiries still to make . I suppose the clergyman who officiated here in the year eighteen hundred and three is no longer alive ? "
230465	230504	230506	230509	my talkative old friend	5894	" No , no , sir , he was dead three or four years before I came here , and that was as long ago as the year twenty - seven . I got this place , sir , "
230511	230619	230506	230509	my talkative old friend	5894	" through the clerk before me leaving it . They say he was driven out of house and home by his wife and she 's living still down in the new town there . I do n't know the rights of the story myself all I know is I got the place . Mr. Wansborough got it for me the son of my old master that I was tell you of . He 's a free , pleasant gentleman as ever lived rides to the hounds , keeps his pointers and all that . He 's vestry - clerk here now as his father was before him . "
230620	230633	230634	230634	I	0	" Did you not tell me your former master lived at Knowlesbury ? "
230667	230676	230678	230679	the clerk	5613	" Yes , to be sure , sir , "
230681	230697	230678	230679	the clerk	5613	" Old Mr. Wansborough lived at Knowlesbury , and young Mr. Wansborough lives there too . "
230698	230730	230678	230679	the clerk	5613	" You said just now he was vestry - clerk , like his father before him . I am not quite sure that I know what a vestry - clerk is . "
230731	230864	230678	230679	the clerk	5613	" Do n't you indeed , sir ? and you come from London too ! Every parish church , you know , has a vestry - clerk and a parish - clerk . The parish - clerk is a man like me except that I 've got a deal more learning than most of them though I do n't boast of it . The vestry - clerk is a sort of an appointment that the lawyers get , and if there 's any business to be done for the vestry , why there they are to do it . It 's just the same in London . Every parish church there has got its vestry - clerk and you may take my word for it he 's sure to be a lawyer . "
230865	230877	230678	230679	the clerk	5613	" Then young Mr. Wansborough is a lawyer , I suppose ? "
230878	230958	230678	230679	the clerk	5613	" Of course he is , sir ! A lawyer in High Street , Knowlesbury the old offices that his father had before him . The number of times I 've swept those offices out , and seen the old gentleman come trotting in to business on his white pony , looking right and left all down the street and nodding to everybody ! Bless you , he was a popular character ! he 'd have done in London ! "
230959	230970	230678	230679	the clerk	5613	" How far is it to Knowlesbury from this place ? "
230971	230978	230980	230981	the clerk	5613	" A long stretch , sir , "
231011	231022	230980	230981	the clerk	5613	" Nigh on five mile , I can tell you ! "
231100	231107	231109	231110	the clerk	5613	" Thank you kindly , sir , "
231122	231212	231109	231110	the clerk	5613	" Are you really going to walk all the way to Knowlesbury and back ? Well ! you 're strong on your legs , too and what a blessing that is , is n't it ? There 's the road , you ca n't miss it . I wish I was going your way it 's pleasant to meet with gentlemen from London in a lost corner like this . One hears the news . Wish you good - morning , sir , and thank you kindly once more . "

251283	251318	251242	251242	she	163	" My mind was quieted , Marian , by my trust in you . Was I right in attributing this sudden change of place to some threatened annoyance on the part of Count Fosco ? "
251319	251323	251324	251324	she	163	" Perfectly right , "
251327	251344	251324	251324	she	163	" I saw him yesterday , and worse than that , Walter I spoke to him . "
251345	251364	251242	251242	she	163	" Spoke to him ? Did he know where we lived ? Did he come to the house ? "
251365	251475	251324	251324	she	163	" He did . To the house but not upstairs . Laura never saw him Laura suspects nothing . I will tell you how it happened : the danger , I believe and hope , is over now . Yesterday , I was in the sitting - room , at our old lodgings . Laura was drawing at the table , and I was walking about and setting things to rights . I passed the window , and as I passed it , looked out into the street . There , on the opposite side of the way , I saw the Count , with a man talking to him "
251476	251485	251242	251242	she	163	" Did he notice you at the window ? "
251486	251505	251324	251324	she	163	" No at least , I thought not . I was too violently startled to be quite sure . "
251506	251516	251242	251242	she	163	" Who was the other man ? A stranger ? "
251517	251547	251324	251324	she	163	" Not a stranger , Walter . As soon as I could draw my breath again , I recognised him . He was the owner of the Lunatic Asylum . "
251548	251559	251242	251242	she	163	" Was the Count pointing out the house to him ? "
251560	252093	251324	251324	she	163	" No , they were talking together as if they had accidentally met in the street . I remained at the window looking at them from behind the curtain . If I had turned round , and if Laura had seen my face at that moment Thank God , she was absorbed over her drawing ! They soon parted . The man from the Asylum went one way , and the Count the other . I began to hope they were in the street by chance , till I saw the Count come back , stop opposite to us again , take out his card - case and pencil , write something , and then cross the road to the shop below us . I ran past Laura before she could see me , and said I had forgotten something upstairs . As soon as I was out of the room I went down to the first landing and waited I was determined to stop him if he tried to come upstairs . He made no such attempt . The girl from the shop came through the door into the passage , with his card in her hand a large gilt card with his name , and a coronet above it , and these lines underneath in pencil : ' Dear lady ' yes ! the villain could address me in that way still ' dear lady , one word , I implore you , on a matter serious to us both . ' If one can think at all , in serious difficulties , one thinks quick . I felt directly that it might be a fatal mistake to leave myself and to leave you in the dark , where such a man as the Count was concerned . I felt that the doubt of what he might do , in your absence , would be ten times more trying to me if I declined to see him than if I consented . ' Ask the gentleman to wait in the shop , ' I said . ' I will be with him in a moment . ' I ran upstairs for my bonnet , being determined not to let him speak to me indoors . I knew his deep ringing voice , and I was afraid Laura might hear it , even in the shop . In less than a minute I was down again in the passage , and had opened the door into the street . He came round to meet me from the shop . There he was in deep mourning , with his smooth bow and his deadly smile , and some idle boys and women near him , staring at his great size , his fine black clothes , and his large cane with the gold knob to it . All the horrible time at Blackwater came back to me the moment I set eyes on him . All the old loathing crept and crawled through me , when he took off his hat with a flourish and spoke to me , as if we had parted on the friendliest terms hardly a day since . "
252094	252101	251242	251242	she	163	" You remember what he said ? "
252102	252344	251324	251324	she	163	" I ca n't repeat it , Walter . You shall know directly what he said about you -but I ca n't repeat what he said to me . It was worse than the polite insolence of his letter . My hands tingled to strike him , as if I had been a man ! I only kept them quiet by tearing his card to pieces under my shawl . Without saying a word on my side , I walked away from the house for fear of Laura seeing us , and he followed , protesting softly all the way . In the first by - street I turned , and asked him what he wanted with me . He wanted two things . First , if I had no objection , to express his sentiments . I declined to hear them . Secondly , to repeat the warning in his letter . I asked , what occasion there was for repeating it . He bowed and smiled , and said he would explain . The explanation exactly confirmed the fears I expressed before you left us . I told you , if you remember , that Sir Percival would be too headstrong to take his friend 's advice where you were concerned , and that there was no danger to be dreaded from the Count till his own interests were threatened , and he was roused into acting for himself ? "
252345	252351	251242	251242	she	163	" I recollect , Marian . "
252352	252637	251324	251324	she	163	" Well , so it has really turned out . The Count offered his advice , but it was refused . Sir Percival would only take counsel of his own violence , his own obstinacy , and his own hatred of you . The Count let him have his way , first privately ascertaining , in case of his own interests being threatened next , where we lived . You were followed , Walter , on returning here , after your first journey to Hampshire , by the lawyer 's men for some distance from the railway , and by the Count himself to the door of the house . How he contrived to escape being seen by you he did not tell me , but he found us out on that occasion , and in that way . Having made the discovery , he took no advantage of it till the news reached him of Sir Percival 's death , and then , as I told you , he acted for himself , because he believed you would next proceed against the dead man 's partner in the conspiracy . He at once made his arrangements to meet the owner of the Asylum in London , and to take him to the place where his runaway patient was hidden , believing that the results , whichever way they ended , would be to involve you in interminable legal disputes and difficulties , and to tie your hands for all purposes of offence , so far as he was concerned . That was his purpose , on his own confession to me . The only consideration which made him hesitate , at the last moment "
252638	252641	251242	251242	she	163	" Yes ? "
252642	252918	251324	251324	she	163	" It is hard to acknowledge it , Walter , and yet I must . I was the only consideration . No words can say how degraded I feel in my own estimation when I think of it , but the one weak point in that man 's iron character is the horrible admiration he feels for me . I have tried , for the sake of my own self - respect , to disbelieve it as long as I could ; but his looks , his actions , force on me the shameful conviction of the truth . The eyes of that monster of wickedness moistened while he was speaking to me they did , Walter ! He declared that at the moment of pointing out the house to the doctor , he thought of my misery if I was separated from Laura , of my responsibility if I was called on to answer for effecting her escape , and he risked the worst that you could do to him , the second time , for my sake . All he asked was that I would remember the sacrifice , and restrain your rashness , in my own interests interests which he might never be able to consult again . I made no such bargain with him I would have died first . But believe him or not , whether it is true or false that he sent the doctor away with an excuse , one thing is certain , I saw the man leave him without so much as a glance at our window , or even at our side of the way . "
252919	253015	251242	251242	she	163	" I believe it , Marian . The best men are not consistent in good why should the worst men be consistent in evil ? At the same time , I suspect him of merely attempting to frighten you , by threatening what he can not really do . I doubt his power of annoying us , by means of the owner of the Asylum , now that Sir Percival is dead , and Mrs. Catherick is free from all control . But let me hear more . What did the Count say of me ? "
253016	253269	251324	251324	she	163	" He spoke last of you . His eyes brightened and hardened , and his manner changed to what I remember it in past times to that mixture of pitiless resolution and mountebank mockery which makes it so impossible to fathom him . ' Warn Mr. Hartright ! ' he said in his loftiest manner . ' He has a man of brains to deal with , a man who snaps his big fingers at the laws and conventions of society , when he measures himself with ME . If my lamented friend had taken my advice , the business of the inquest would have been with the body of Mr. Hartright . But my lamented friend was obstinate . See ! I mourn his loss inwardly in my soul , outwardly on my hat . This trivial crape expresses sensibilities which I summon Mr. Hartright to respect . They may be transformed to immeasurable enmities if he ventures to disturb them . Let him be content with what he has got with what I leave unmolested , for your sake , to him and to you . Say to him with my compliments , if he stirs me , he has Fosco to deal with . In the English of the Popular Tongue , I inform him Fosco sticks at nothing . Dear lady , good morning . ' His cold grey eyes settled on my face he took off his hat solemnly bowed , bare - headed and left me . "
253270	253280	251242	251242	she	163	" Without returning ? without saying more last words ? "
253281	253500	251324	251324	she	163	" He turned at the corner of the street , and waved his hand , and then struck it theatrically on his breast . I lost sight of him after that . He disappeared in the opposite direction to our house , and I ran back to Laura . Before I was indoors again , I had made up my mind that we must go . The house especially in your absence was a place of danger instead of a place of safety , now that the Count had discovered it . If I could have felt certain of your return , I should have risked waiting till you came back . But I was certain of nothing , and I acted at once on my own impulse . You had spoken , before leaving us , of moving into a quieter neighbourhood and purer air , for the sake of Laura 's health . I had only to remind her of that , and to suggest surprising you and saving you trouble by managing the move in your absence , to make her quite as anxious for the change as I was . She helped me to pack up your things , and she has arranged them all for you in your new working - room here . "
253501	253512	253651	253651	I	0	" What made you think of coming to this place ? "
253513	253650	251324	251324	she	163	" My ignorance of other localities in the neighbourhood of London . I felt the necessity of getting as far away as possible from our old lodgings , and I knew something of Fulham , because I had once been at school there . I despatched a messenger with a note , on the chance that the school might still be in existence . It was in existence the daughters of my old mistress were carrying it on for her , and they engaged this place from the instructions I had sent . It was just post - time when the messenger returned to me with the address of the house . We moved after dark we came here quite unobserved . Have I done right , Walter ? Have I justified your trust in me ? "
253812	253821	253822	253822	I	0	" Not many weeks have passed , Marian , "
253948	253948	253939	253940	The other	1244	"
253974	253986	253987	253987	I	0	" I do n't disguise from myself , or from you , "
253991	254161	253987	253987	I	0	" that the prospect before us is more than doubtful . The risks we have run already are , it may be , trifles compared with the risks that threaten us in the future , but the venture shall be tried , Marian , for all that . I am not rash enough to measure myself against such a man as the Count before I am well prepared for him . I have learnt patience I can wait my time . Let him believe that his message has produced its effect let him know nothing of us , and hear nothing of us let us give him full time to feel secure his own boastful nature , unless I seriously mistake him , will hasten that result . This is one reason for waiting , but there is another more important still . My position , Marian , towards you and towards Laura ought to be a stronger one than it is now before I try our last chance . "
254174	254181	254182	254182	she	6670	" How can it be stronger ? "
254185	254191	254192	254192	I	0	" I will tell you , "
254195	254280	254192	254192	I	0	" when the time comes . It has not come yet it may never come at all . I may be silent about it to Laura for ever I must be silent now , even to YOU , till I see for myself that I can harmlessly and honourably speak . Let us leave that subject . There is another which has more pressing claims on our attention . You have kept Laura , mercifully kept her , in ignorance of her husband 's death "
254281	254299	254162	254162	She	6670	" Oh , Walter , surely it must be long yet before we tell her of it ? "
254300	254356	254192	254192	I	0	" No , Marian . Better that you should reveal it to her now , than that accident , which no one can guard against , should reveal it to her at some future time . Spare her all the details break it to her very tenderly , but tell her that he is dead . "
254357	254383	254162	254162	She	6670	" You have a reason , Walter , for wishing her to know of her husband 's death besides the reason you have just mentioned ? "
254384	254388	254192	254192	I	0	" I have . "
254389	254415	254162	254162	She	6670	" A reason connected with that subject which must not be mentioned between us yet ? which may never be mentioned to Laura at all ? "
254494	254500	254501	254501	she	6671	" I think I understand , "
254504	254527	254501	254501	she	6671	" I think I owe it to her and to you , Walter , to tell her of her husband 's death . "

257779	257800	257801	257801	she	150	" You are thinking of that subject which was mentioned between us on the evening of your return from Hampshire , "
257804	257925	257801	257801	she	150	" I have been expecting you to allude to it for some time past . There must be a change in our little household , Walter , we can not go on much longer as we are now . I see it as plainly as you do as plainly as Laura sees it , though she says nothing . How strangely the old times in Cumberland seem to have come back ! You and I are together again , and the one subject of interest between us is Laura once more . I could almost fancy that this room is the summer - house at Limmeridge , and that those waves beyond us are beating on our sea - shore . "
257926	257938	257939	257939	I	0	" I was guided by your advice in those past days , "
257942	257960	257939	257939	I	0	" and now , Marian , with reliance tenfold greater I will be guided by it again . "
258013	258022	258023	258023	I	0	" Whatever comes of this confidence between us , "
258026	258227	258023	258023	I	0	" whether it ends happily or sorrowfully for ME , Laura 's interests will still be the interests of my life . When we leave this place , on whatever terms we leave it , my determination to wrest from Count Fosco the confession which I failed to obtain from his accomplice , goes back with me to London , as certainly as I go back myself . Neither you nor I can tell how that man may turn on me , if I bring him to bay ; we only know , by his own words and actions , that he is capable of striking at me through Laura , without a moment 's hesitation , or a moment 's remorse . In our present position I have no claim on her which society sanctions , which the law allows , to strengthen me in resisting him , and in protecting HER . This places me at a serious disadvantage . If I am to fight our cause with the Count , strong in the consciousness of Laura 's safety , I must fight it for my Wife . Do you agree to that , Marian , so far ? "
258228	258235	258236	258236	she	6770	" To every word of it , "
258239	258250	258251	258251	I	0	" I will not plead out of my own heart , "
258255	258401	258251	258251	I	0	" I will not appeal to the love which has survived all changes and all shocks I will rest my only vindication of myself for thinking of her , and speaking of her as my wife , on what I have just said . If the chance of forcing a confession from the Count is , as I believe it to be , the last chance left of publicly establishing the fact of Laura 's existence , the least selfish reason that I can advance for our marriage is recognised by us both . But I may be wrong in my conviction other means of achieving our purpose may be in our power , which are less uncertain and less dangerous . I have searched anxiously , in my own mind , for those means , and I have not found them . Have you ? "
258402	258417	258023	258023	I	0	" No . I have thought about it too , and thought in vain . "
258418	258423	258424	258424	I	0	" In all likelihood , "
258427	258839	258424	258424	I	0	" the same questions have occurred to you , in considering this difficult subject , which have occurred to me . Ought we to return with her to Limmeridge , now that she is like herself again , and trust to the recognition of her by the people of the village , or by the children at the school ? Ought we to appeal to the practical test of her handwriting ? Suppose we did so . Suppose the recognition of her obtained , and the identity of the handwriting established . Would success in both those cases do more than supply an excellent foundation for a trial in a court of law ? Would the recognition and the handwriting prove her identity to Mr. Fairlie and take her back to Limmeridge House , against the evidence of her aunt , against the evidence of the medical certificate , against the fact of the funeral and the fact of the inscription on the tomb ? No ! We could only hope to succeed in throwing a serious doubt on the assertion of her death , a doubt which nothing short of a legal inquiry can settle . I will assume that we possess what we have certainly not got money enough to carry this inquiry on through all its stages . I will assume that Mr. Fairlie 's prejudices might be reasoned away that the false testimony of the Count and his wife , and all the rest of the false testimony , might be confuted that the recognition could not possibly be ascribed to a mistake between Laura and Anne Catherick , or the handwriting be declared by our enemies to be a clever fraud all these are assumptions which , more or less , set plain probabilities at defiance ; but let them pass and let us ask ourselves what would be the first consequence or the first questions put to Laura herself on the subject of the conspiracy . We know only too well what the consequence would be , for we know that she has never recovered her memory of what happened to her in London . Examine her privately , or examine her publicly , she is utterly incapable of assisting the assertion of her own case . If you do n't see this , Marian , as plainly as I see it , we will go to Limmeridge and try the experiment to - morrow . "
258840	258930	259260	259260	Marian	150	" I DO see it , Walter . Even if we had the means of paying all the law expenses , even if we succeeded in the end , the delays would be unendurable , the perpetual suspense , after what we have suffered already , would be heartbreaking . You are right about the hopelessness of going to Limmeridge . I wish I could feel sure that you are right also in determining to try that last chance with the Count . IS it a chance at all ? "
258931	259067	258424	258424	I	0	" Beyond a doubt , Yes . It is the chance of recovering the lost date of Laura 's journey to London . Without returning to the reasons I gave you some time since , I am still as firmly persuaded as ever that there is a discrepancy between the date of that journey and the date on the certificate of death . There lies the weak point of the whole conspiracy it crumbles to pieces if we attack it in that way , and the means of attacking it are in possession of the Count . If I succeed in wresting them from him , the object of your life and mine is fulfilled . If I fail , the wrong that Laura has suffered will , in this world , never be redressed . "
259068	259077	259260	259260	Marian	150	" Do you fear failure yourself , Walter ? "
259078	259259	258424	258424	I	0	" I dare not anticipate success , and for that very reason , Marian , I speak openly and plainly as I have spoken now . In my heart and my conscience I can say it , Laura 's hopes for the future are at their lowest ebb . I know that her fortune is gone I know that the last chance of restoring her to her place in the world lies at the mercy of her worst enemy , of a man who is now absolutely unassailable , and who may remain unassailable to the end . With every worldly advantage gone from her , with all prospect of recovering her rank and station more than doubtful , with no clearer future before her than the future which her husband can provide , the poor drawing - master may harmlessly open his heart at last . In the days of her prosperity , Marian , I was only the teacher who guided her hand I ask for it , in her adversity , as the hand of my wife ! "
259323	259326	259327	259327	she	150	" Walter ! "
259330	259371	259327	259327	she	150	" I once parted you both , for your good and for hers . Wait here , my brother ! wait , my dearest , best friend , till Laura comes , and tells you what I have done now ! "

Look back into your own life before you came to England . You left Italy , as you have told me yourself , for political reasons . You have never mentioned those reasons to me , and I do n't inquire into them now . I only ask you to consult your own recollections , and to say if they suggest no past cause for the terror which the first sight of you produced in that man . "

264938	264948	264949	264949	he	524	" You won your right over me , Walter , "

265402	265662	265399	265399	he	524	" except that it was for political reasons . If I had been driven to this country by the persecution of my government , I should not have kept those reasons a secret from you or from any one . I have concealed them because no government authority has pronounced the sentence of my exile . You have heard , Walter , of the political societies that are hidden in every great city on the continent of Europe ? To one of those societies I belonged in Italy and belong still in England . When I came to this country , I came by the direction of my chief . I was over - zealous in my younger time I ran the risk of compromising myself and others . For those reasons I was ordered to emigrate to England and to wait . I emigrated I have waited I wait still . To - morrow I may be called away ten years hence I may be called away . It is all one to me I am here , I support myself by teaching , and I wait . I violate no oath you shall hear why presently in making my confidence complete by telling you the name of the society to which I belong . All I do is to put my life in your hands . If what I say to you now is ever known by others to have passed my lips , as certainly as we two sit here , I am a dead man . "
265702	265706	265663	265663	He	6982	" The Brotherhood , "
265724	265731	265732	265732	Pesca	135	" The object of the Brotherhood , "
265736	266043	265732	265732	Pesca	135	" is , briefly , the object of other political societies of the same sort the destruction of tyranny and the assertion of the rights of the people . The principles of the Brotherhood are two . So long as a man 's life is useful , or even harmless only , he has the right to enjoy it . But , if his life inflicts injury on the well - being of his fellow - men , from that moment he forfeits the right , and it is not only no crime , but a positive merit , to deprive him of it . It is not for me to say in what frightful circumstances of oppression and suffering this society took its rise . It is not for you to say you Englishmen , who have conquered your freedom so long ago , that you have conveniently forgotten what blood you shed , and what extremities you proceeded to in the conquering it is not for you to say how far the worst of all exasperations may , or may not , carry the maddened men of an enslaved nation . The iron that has entered into our souls has gone too deep for you to find it . Leave the refugee alone ! Laugh at him , distrust him , open your eyes in wonder at that secret self which smoulders in him , sometimes under the everyday respectability and tranquillity of a man like me sometimes under the grinding poverty , the fierce squalor , of men less lucky , less pliable , less patient than I am but judge us not ! In the time of your first Charles you might have done us justice the long luxury of your own freedom has made you incapable of doing us justice now . "
266099	266103	266104	266104	he	6985	" So far , "
266107	266635	266104	266104	he	6985	" you think the society like other societies . Its object in your English opinion is anarchy and revolution . It takes the life of a bad king or a bad minister , as if the one and the other were dangerous wild beasts to be shot at the first opportunity . I grant you this . But the laws of the Brotherhood are the laws of no other political society on the face of the earth . The members are not known to one another . There is a president in Italy ; there are presidents abroad . Each of these has his secretary . The presidents and the secretaries know the members , but the members , among themselves , are all strangers , until their chiefs see fit , in the political necessity of the time , or in the private necessity of the society , to make them known to each other . With such a safeguard as this there is no oath among us on admittance . We are identified with the Brotherhood by a secret mark , which we all bear , which lasts while our lives last . We are told to go about our ordinary business , and to report ourselves to the president , or the secretary , four times a year , in the event of our services being required . We are warned , if we betray the Brotherhood , or if we injure it by serving other interests , that we die by the principles of the Brotherhood die by the hand of a stranger who may be sent from the other end of the world to strike the blow or by the hand of our own bosom - friend , who may have been a member unknown to us through all the years of our intimacy . Sometimes the death is delayed sometimes it follows close on the treachery . It is our first business to know how to wait our second business to know how to obey when the word is spoken . Some of us may wait our lives through , and may not be wanted . Some of us may be called to the work , or to the preparation for the work , the very day of our admission . I myself the little , easy , cheerful man you know , who , of his own accord , would hardly lift up his handkerchief to strike down the fly that buzzes about his face I , in my younger time , under provocation so dreadful that I will not tell you of it , entered the Brotherhood by an impulse , as I might have killed myself by an impulse . I must remain in it now it has got me , whatever I may think of it in my better circumstances and my cooler manhood , to my dying day . While I was still in Italy I was chosen secretary , and all the members of that time , who were brought face to face with my president , were brought face to face also with me . "
266678	266687	266688	266688	he	6987	" You have drawn your own conclusion already , "
266691	266741	266688	266688	he	6987	" I see it in your face . Tell me nothing keep me out of the secret of your thoughts . Let me make my one last sacrifice of myself , for your sake , and then have done with this subject , never to return to it again . "
266766	266777	266778	266778	he	6987	" I promised you that this confidence should be complete , "
266796	266851	266778	266778	he	6987	" Whatever comes of it you shall not reproach me with having hidden anything from you which it was necessary to your interests to know . I have said that the Brotherhood identifies its members by a mark that lasts for life . See the place , and the mark on it for yourself . "
266931	266944	266945	266945	he	6987	" A man who has this mark , branded in this place , "
266953	267198	266945	266945	he	6987	" is a member of the Brotherhood . A man who has been false to the Brotherhood is discovered sooner or later by the chiefs who know him presidents or secretaries , as the case may be . And a man discovered by the chiefs is dead . NO HUMAN LAWS CAN PROTECT HIM . Remember what you have seen and heard draw what conclusions YOU like act as you please . But , in the name of God , whatever you discover , whatever you do , tell me nothing ! Let me remain free from a responsibility which it horrifies me to think of which I know , in my conscience , is not my responsibility now . For the last time I say it on my honour as a gentleman , on my oath as a Christian , if the man you pointed out at the Opera knows ME , he is so altered , or so disguised , that I do not know him . I am ignorant of his proceedings or his purposes in England . I never saw him , I never heard the name he goes by , to my knowledge , before to - night . I say no more . Leave me a little , Walter . I am overpowered by what has happened I am shaken by what I have said . Let me try to be like myself again when we meet next . "

271044	271094	271041	271041	I	0	" And I have not come to trifle with you . I am here on a matter of life and death , and if that door which you have locked was open at this moment , nothing you could say or do would induce me to pass through it . "
271182	271191	271192	271192	he	2074	" On a matter of life and death , "
271197	271215	271192	271192	he	2074	" Those words are more serious , perhaps , than you think . What do you mean ? "
271216	271221	271232	271232	His	2074	" What I say . "
271277	271287	271288	271288	he	2074	" So you know why I am leaving London ? "
271292	271302	271303	271303	He	2074	" Tell me the reason , if you please . "
271316	271324	271325	271325	I	0	" I can do better than that , "
271328	271340	271325	271325	I	0	" I can SHOW you the reason , if you like . "
271341	271348	271313	271313	he	2074	" How can you show it ? "
271349	271357	271358	271358	I	0	" You have got your coat off , "
271361	271380	271358	271358	I	0	" Roll up the shirt - sleeve on your left arm , and you will see it there . "
271531	271536	271537	271537	I	0	" Wait a little , "
271540	271571	271537	271537	I	0	" You have got the door locked you see I do n't move you see my hands are empty . Wait a little . I have something more to say . "
271572	271578	271579	271579	he	2074	" You have said enough , "
271606	271629	271579	271579	he	2074	" I want one moment for my own thoughts , if you please . Do you guess what I am thinking about ? "
271630	271635	271677	271677	his	2074	" Perhaps I do . "
271636	271641	271642	271642	he	2074	" I am thinking , "
271646	271665	271642	271642	he	2074	" whether I shall add to the disorder in this room by scattering your brains about the fireplace . "
271686	271702	271703	271703	I	0	" I advise you to read two lines of writing which I have about me , "
271706	271714	271703	271703	I	0	" before you finally decide that question . "
271773	271802	271767	271767	He	2074	" Your letter is received . If I do n't hear from you before the time you mention , I will break the seal when the clock strikes . "
271872	271884	271885	271885	he	2074	" I do n't lock up my drawer , Mr. Hartright , "
271888	271945	271885	271885	he	2074	" and I do n't say that I may not scatter your brains about the fireplace yet . But I am a just man even to my enemy , and I will acknowledge beforehand that they are cleverer brains than I thought them . Come to the point , sir ! You want something of me ? "
271946	271957	271969	271969	His	2074	" I do , and I mean to have it . "
271958	271962	271885	271885	he	2074	" On conditions ? "
271963	271968	271969	271969	His	2074	" On no conditions . "
271977	271987	271988	271988	he	2074	" Bah ! we are travelling in a circle , "
271991	272149	271988	271988	he	2074	" and those clever brains of yours are in danger again . Your tone is deplorably imprudent , sir moderate it on the spot ! The risk of shooting you on the place where you stand is less to me than the risk of letting you out of this house , except on conditions that I dictate and approve . You have not got my lamented friend to deal with now you are face to face with Fosco ! If the lives of twenty Mr. Hartrights were the stepping - stones to my safety , over all those stones I would go , sustained by my sublime indifference , self - balanced by my impenetrable calm . Respect me , if you love your own life ! I summon you to answer three questions before you open your lips again . Hear them they are necessary to this interview . Answer them they are necessary to ME . "
272160	272164	272165	272165	he	7118	" First question ! "
272168	272189	272165	272165	he	7118	" You come here possessed of information which may be true or may be false where did you get it ? "
272190	272197	271988	271988	he	2074	" I decline to tell you . "
272198	272263	272264	272264	He	7118	" No matter I shall find out . If that information is true mind I say , with the whole force of my resolution , if you are making your market of it here by treachery of your own or by treachery of some other man . I note that circumstance for future use in my memory , which forgets nothing , and proceed . "
272270	272289	272264	272264	He	7118	" Second question ! Those lines you invited me to read are without signature . Who wrote them ? "
272290	272311	271988	271988	he	2074	" A man whom I have every reason to depend on , and whom you have every reason to fear . "
272329	272337	272338	272338	he	7118	" How long do you give me , "
272350	272361	272338	272338	he	7118	" before the clock strikes and the seal is broken ? "
272362	272373	272374	272374	I	0	" Time enough for you to come to my terms , "
272377	272395	272338	272338	he	7118	" Give me a plainer answer , Mr. Hartright . What hour is the clock to strike ? "
272396	272404	272338	272338	he	7118	" Nine , to - morrow morning . "
272405	272483	272338	272338	he	7118	" Nine , to - morrow morning ? Yes , yes your trap is laid for me before I can get my passport regulated and leave London . It is not earlier , I suppose ? We will see about that presently I can keep you hostage here , and bargain with you to send for your letter before I let you go . In the meantime , be so good next as to mention your terms . "
272484	272508	272509	272509	He	7119	" You shall hear them . They are simple , and soon stated . You know whose interests I represent in coming here ? "
272524	272532	272533	272533	he	7119	" I consent to hazard a guess , "
272537	272546	272533	272533	he	7119	" A lady 's interests , of course ! "
272547	272553	272554	272554	He	7119	" My Wife 's interests . "
272620	272627	272628	272628	I	0	" You are well enough aware , "
272632	272687	272628	272628	I	0	" of the course which my inquiries have taken for many months past , to know that any attempted denial of plain facts will be quite useless in my presence . You are guilty of an infamous conspiracy ! And the gain of a fortune of ten thousand pounds was your motive for it . "
272703	272708	272709	272709	I	0	" Keep your gain , "
272730	272759	272719	272719	his	7119	" I am not here to disgrace myself by bargaining for money which has passed through your hands , and which has been the price of a vile crime .
272760	272862	272890	272890	his	7121	" Gently , Mr. Hartright . Your moral clap - traps have an excellent effect in England keep them for yourself and your own countrymen , if you please . The ten thousand pounds was a legacy left to my excellent wife by the late Mr. Fairlie . Place the affair on those grounds , and I will discuss it if you like . To a man of my sentiments , however , the subject is deplorably sordid . I prefer to pass it over . I invite you to resume the discussion of your terms . What do you demand ? "
272863	272887	272719	272719	his	7119	" In the first place , I demand a full confession of the conspiracy , written and signed in my presence by yourself . "
272894	272897	272898	272898	he	7121	" One ! "
272913	272949	272890	272890	his	7121	" In the second place , I demand a plain proof , which does not depend on your personal asseveration , of the date at which my wife left Blackwater Park and travelled to London . "
272950	272969	272970	272970	he	7121	" So ! so ! you can lay your finger , I see , on the weak place , "
272974	272978	272970	272970	he	7121	" Any more ? "
272979	272986	272890	272890	his	7121	" At present , no more . "
272987	273396	272970	272970	he	7121	" Good ! you have mentioned your terms , now listen to mine . The responsibility to myself of admitting what you are pleased to call the ' conspiracy ' is less , perhaps , upon the whole , than the responsibility of laying you dead on that hearthrug . Let us say that I meet your proposal on my own conditions . The statement you demand of me shall be written , and the plain proof shall be produced . You call a letter from my late lamented friend informing me of the day and hour of his wife 's arrival in London , written , signed , and dated by himself , a proof , I suppose ? I can give you this . I can also send you to the man of whom I hired the carriage to fetch my visitor from the railway , on the day when she arrived his order - book may help you to your date , even if his coachman who drove me proves to be of no use . These things I can do , and will do , on conditions . I recite them . First condition ! Madame Fosco and I leave this house when and how we please , without interference of any kind on your part . Second condition ! You wait here , in company with me , to see my agent , who is coming at seven o'clock in the morning to regulate my affairs . You give my agent a written order to the man who has got your sealed letter to resign his possession of it . You wait here till my agent places that letter unopened in my hands , and you then allow me one clear half - hour to leave the house after which you resume your own freedom of action and go where you please . Third condition ! You give me the satisfaction of a gentleman for your intrusion into my private affairs , and for the language you have allowed yourself to use to me at this conference . The time and place , abroad , to be fixed in a letter from my hand when I am safe on the Continent , and that letter to contain a strip of paper measuring accurately the length of my sword . Those are my terms . Inform me if you accept them Yes or No . "
273719	273725	273726	273726	I	0	" I accept your conditions , "
273729	273737	273726	273726	I	0	" With one reservation on my part . "
273738	273745	273746	273746	he	7129	" What reservation may that be ? "
273749	273757	273758	273758	I	0	" It refers to the sealed letter , "
273761	273782	273758	273758	I	0	" I require you to destroy it unopened in my presence as soon as it is placed in your hands . "
273865	273871	273872	273872	he	7129	" I grant your reservation , "
273886	273904	273872	273872	he	7129	" It is not worth dispute the letter shall be destroyed when it comes into my hands . "
273952	273955	273956	273956	he	7129	" Ouf ! "
273964	274012	273956	273956	he	7129	" the skirmish was hot while it lasted . Take a seat , Mr. Hartright . We meet as mortal enemies hereafter let us , like gallant gentlemen , exchange polite attentions in the meantime . Permit me to take the liberty of calling for my wife . "
274020	274023	274024	274024	he	7129	" Eleanor ! "
274040	274046	274048	274049	the Count	2074	" Madame Fosco Mr. Hartright , "
274057	274061	274062	274062	he	7129	" My angel , "
274070	274112	274062	274062	he	7129	" will your labours of packing up allow you time to make me some nice strong coffee ? I have writing business to transact with Mr. Hartright and I require the full possession of my intelligence to do justice to myself . "
274215	274224	274225	274225	he	7129	" I shall make this a remarkable document , "
274235	274279	274225	274225	he	7129	" Habits of literary composition are perfectly familiar to me . One of the rarest of all the intellectual accomplishments that a man can possess is the grand faculty of arranging his ideas . Immense privilege ! I possess it . Do you ? "
274443	274454	274455	274455	he	7129	" May I offer you some coffee , Mr. Hartright ? "
274466	274476	274477	274477	he	7129	" What ! you think I shall poison you ? "
274481	274494	274495	274495	he	7129	" The English intellect is sound , so far as it goes , "
274504	274520	274495	274495	he	7129	" but it has one grave defect it is always cautious in the wrong place . "
274803	274806	274807	274807	he	7129	" Bravo ! "
274836	274842	274843	274843	he	7129	" Done , Mr. Hartright ! "
274859	274976	274843	274843	he	7129	" Done , to my own profound satisfaction to YOUR profound astonishment , when you read what I have written . The subject is exhausted : the man Fosco is not . I proceed to the arrangement of my slips to the revision of my slips to the reading of my slips addressed emphatically to your private ear . Four o'clock has just struck . Good ! Arrangement , revision , reading , from four to five . Short snooze of restoration for myself from five to six . Final preparations from six to seven . Affair of agent and sealed letter from seven to eight . At eight , en route . Behold the programme ! "
275114	275117	275072	275072	He	7129	" Lady Glyde "
275193	275200	275202	275203	the Count	2074	" A quarter - past five , "
275210	275265	275202	275203	the Count	2074	" Time for my restorative snooze . I personally resemble Napoleon the Great , as you may have remarked , Mr. Hartright I also resemble that immortal man in my power of commanding sleep at will . Excuse me one moment . I will summon Madame Fosco , to keep you from feeling dull . "
275326	275334	275336	275337	the Count	2074	" Amuse Mr. Hartright , my angel , "
275411	275423	275424	275424	she	194	" I have been listening to your conversation with my husband , "
275427	275445	275424	275424	she	194	" If I had been in HIS place I would have laid you dead on the hearthrug . "
275498	275504	275505	275505	he	7795	" I feel infinitely refreshed , "
275508	275552	275505	275505	he	7795	" Eleanor , my good wife , are you all ready upstairs ? That is well . My little packing here can be completed in ten minutes my travelling - dress assumed in ten minutes more . What remains before the agent comes ? "
275570	275573	275574	275574	he	7795	" Ah ! "
275578	275650	275574	275574	he	7795	" a last laceration of my sympathies still remains . My innocent pets ! my little cherished children ! what am I to do with them ? For the present we are settled nowhere ; for the present we travel incessantly the less baggage we carry the better for ourselves . My cockatoo , my canaries , and my little mice who will cherish them when their good Papa is gone ? "
275706	275710	275711	275711	he	7795	" An idea ! "
275714	275755	275711	275711	he	7795	" I will offer my canaries and my cockatoo to this vast Metropolis my agent shall present them in my name to the Zoological Gardens of London . The Document that describes them shall be drawn out on the spot . "
275771	275828	275756	275756	He	7795	" Number one . Cockatoo of transcendent plumage : attraction , of himself , to all visitors of taste . Number two . Canaries of unrivalled vivacity and intelligence : worthy of the garden of Eden , worthy also of the garden in the Regent 's Park . Homage to British Zoology . Offered by Fosco . "
275843	275853	275855	275856	Madame Fosco	194	" Count ! you have not included the mice , "
275873	275880	275881	275881	he	7795	" All human resolution , Eleanor , "
275885	275923	275881	275881	he	7795	" has its limits . MY limits are inscribed on that Document . I can not part with my white mice . Bear with me , my angel , and remove them to their travelling cage upstairs . "
275924	275928	275930	275931	Madame Fosco	194	" Admirable tenderness ! "

276334	276347	276331	276331	he	2074	" but this matter , Mr. Hartright , shall not end here . "
276415	276424	276425	276425	he	6687	" Follow me as far as the passage , "
276431	276444	276425	276425	he	6687	" I may want to speak to you at the last moment . "
276478	276484	276485	276485	he	2074	" Remember the Third condition ! "
276488	276513	276485	276485	he	2074	" You shall hear from me , Mr. Hartright I may claim from you the satisfaction of a gentleman sooner than you think for . "
276544	276549	276550	276550	he	2074	" One word more , "
276554	276601	276550	276550	he	2074	" When I last saw Miss Halcombe , she looked thin and ill . I am anxious about that admirable woman . Take care of her , sir ! With my hand on my heart , I solemnly implore you , take care of Miss Halcombe ! "

We DID go to the station , and it WAS from Forest Road . There was a parrot , or summat like it , screeching in the window . The gentleman was in a mortal hurry about the lady 's luggage , and he gave me a handsome present for looking sharp and getting the boxes . "
