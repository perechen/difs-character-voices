814	827	810	811	a woman	283	" If the barons live at war , ploughfolk must eat roots . "
828	831	833	833	Dick	76	" Nay , "
835	850	833	833	Dick	76	" every man that follows shall have sixpence a day , and archers twelve . "
851	856	858	859	the woman	284	" If they live , "
861	877	858	859	the woman	284	" that may very well be ; but how if they die , my master ? "
878	890	892	892	Dick	76	" They can not better die than for their natural lord , "
894	901	903	907	the man in the smock	285	" No natural lord of mine , "
909	1001	903	907	the man in the smock	285	" I followed the Walsinghams ; so we all did down Brierly way , till two years ago , come Candlemas . And now I must side with Brackley ! It was the law that did it ; call ye that natural ? But now , what with Sir Daniel and what with Sir Oliver that knows more of law than honesty I have no natural lord but poor King Harry the Sixt , God bless him ! the poor innocent that can not tell his right hand from his left . "
1002	1012	1014	1014	Dick	76	" Ye speak with an ill tongue , friend , "
1016	1084	1014	1014	Dick	76	" to miscall your good master and my lord the king in the same libel . But King Harry praised be the saints ! has come again into his right mind , and will have all things peaceably ordained . And as for Sir Daniel , y are very brave behind his back . But I will be no tale - bearer ; and let that suffice . "
1085	1096	1098	1099	the peasant	286	" I say no harm of you , Master Richard , "
1101	1147	1098	1099	the peasant	286	" Y are a lad ; but when ye come to a man s inches , ye will find ye have an empty pocket . I say no more : the saints help Sir Daniel s neighbours , and the Blessed Maid protect his wards ! "
1148	1151	1153	1153	Richard	74	" Clipsby , "
1155	1177	1153	1153	Richard	74	" you speak what I can not hear with honour . Sir Daniel is my good master , and my guardian . "
1178	1190	1192	1192	Clipsby	80	" Come , now , will ye read me a riddle ? "
1194	1202	1192	1192	Clipsby	80	" On whose side is Sir Daniel ? "
1203	1208	1210	1210	Dick	76	" I know not , "
1241	1244	1246	1246	Clipsby	80	" Ay , "
1248	1272	1246	1246	Clipsby	80	" you , nor no man . For , indeed , he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York . "
1365	1368	1369	1369	he	290	" Clipsby , "
1372	1437	1438	1438	he	290	" off to the Moat House , and send all other laggards the same gate . Bowyer will give you jack and salet . We must ride before curfew . Look to it : he that is last at the lych - gate Sir Daniel shall reward . Look to it right well ! I know you for a man of naught . Nance , "
1447	1454	1438	1438	he	290	" is old Appleyard up town ? "
1455	1461	1463	1464	the woman	284	" I ll warrant you , "
1466	1474	1463	1464	the woman	284	" In his field , for sure . "
1507	1515	1517	1517	Bennet	77	" Ye will see the old shrew , "
1519	1553	1517	1517	Bennet	77	" He will waste more time grumbling and prating of Harry the Fift than would serve a man to shoe a horse . And all because he has been to the French wars ! "
1765	1786	1751	1751	he	307	" Now , dear lady , if thy will be , I pray you that you will rue on me . "
1787	1791	1793	1793	Hatch	77	" Nick Appleyard , "
1795	1822	1793	1793	Hatch	77	" Sir Oliver commends him to you , and bids that ye shall come within this hour to the Moat House , there to take command . "
1829	1836	1837	1837	he	310	" Save you , my masters ! "
1842	1849	1837	1837	he	310	" And where goeth Master Hatch ? "
1850	1866	1868	1868	Bennet	77	" Master Hatch is off to Kettley , with every man that we can horse , "
1870	1887	1868	1868	Bennet	77	" There is a fight toward , it seems , and my lord stays a reinforcement . "
1888	1893	1895	1895	Appleyard	84	" Ay , verily , "
1897	1908	1895	1895	Appleyard	84	" And what will ye leave me to garrison withal ? "
1909	1923	1925	1925	Hatch	77	" I leave you six good men , and Sir Oliver to boot , "
1927	1935	1937	1937	Appleyard	84	" It ll not hold the place , "
1939	1955	1937	1937	Appleyard	84	" the number sufficeth not . It would take two score to make it good . "
1956	1971	1973	1974	the other	311	" Why , it s for that we came to you , old shrew ! "
1976	1996	1973	1974	the other	311	" Who else is there but you that could do aught in such a house with such a garrison ? "
1997	2011	2013	2013	Nick	84	" Ay ! when the pinch comes , ye remember the old shoe , "
2015	2063	2013	2013	Nick	84	" There is not a man of you can back a horse or hold a bill ; and as for archery St. Michael ! if old Harry the Fift were back again , he would stand and let ye shoot at him for a farthen a shoot ! "
2064	2079	2081	2081	Bennet	77	" Nay , Nick , there s some can draw a good bow yet , "
2083	2089	2091	2091	Appleyard	84	" Draw a good bow ! "
2093	2133	2091	2091	Appleyard	84	" Yes ! But who ll shoot me a good shoot ? It s there the eye comes in , and the head between your shoulders . Now , what might you call a long shoot , Bennet Hatch ? "
2134	2137	2139	2139	Bennet	77	" Well , "
2145	2158	2139	2139	Bennet	77	" it would be a long shoot from here into the forest . "
2159	2169	2171	2173	the old fellow	310	" Ay , it would be a longish shoot , "
2197	2206	2208	2208	Bennet	77	" Why , what are you looking at ? "
2214	2223	2208	2208	Bennet	77	" Do , you see Harry the Fift ? "
2261	2268	2270	2270	Dick	76	" What is it , Appleyard ? "
2272	2278	2280	2280	Appleyard	84	" Why , the birds , "
2340	2346	2348	2348	Bennet	77	" What of the birds ? "
2350	2353	2355	2355	Appleyard	84	" Ay ! "
2357	2423	2355	2355	Appleyard	84	" y are a wise man to go to war , Master Bennet . Birds are a good sentry ; in forest places they be the first line of battle . Look you , now , if we lay here in camp , there might be archers skulking down to get the wind of us ; and here would you be , none the wiser ! "
2424	2430	2432	2432	Hatch	77	" Why , old shrew , "
2434	2472	2432	2432	Hatch	77	" there be no men nearer us than Sir Daniel s , at Kettley ; y are as safe as in London Tower ; and ye raise scares upon a man for a few chaffinches and sparrows ! "
2473	2477	2479	2479	Appleyard	84	" Hear him ! "
2481	2513	2479	2479	Appleyard	84	" How many a rogue would give his two crop ears to have a shoot at either of us ? Saint Michael , man ! they hate us like two polecats ! "
2514	2526	2528	2528	Hatch	77	" Well , sooth it is , they hate Sir Daniel , "
2534	2552	2554	2554	Appleyard	84	" Ay , they hate Sir Daniel , and they hate every man that serves with him , "
2556	2618	2554	2554	Appleyard	84	" and in the first order of hating , they hate Bennet Hatch and old Nicholas the bowman . See ye here : if there was a stout fellow yonder in the wood - edge , and you and I stood fair for him as , by Saint George , we stand ! which , think ye , would he choose ? "
2619	2627	2629	2629	Hatch	77	" You , for a good wager , "
2631	2644	2646	2648	the old archer	320	" My surcoat to a leather belt , it would be you ! "
2650	2756	2646	2648	the old archer	320	" Ye burned Grimstone , Bennet they ll ne er forgive you that , my master . And as for me , I ll soon be in a good place , God grant , and out of bow - shoot ay , and cannon - shoot of all their malices . I am an old man , and draw fast to homeward , where the bed is ready . But for you , Bennet , y are to remain behind here at your own peril , and if ye come to my years unhanged , the old true - blue English spirit will be dead . "
2757	2768	2770	2770	Hatch	77	" Y are the shrewishest old dolt in Tunstall Forest , "
2778	2818	2770	2770	Hatch	77	" Get ye to your arms before Sir Oliver come , and leave prating for one good while . An ye had talked so much with Harry the Fift , his ears would ha been richer than his pocket . "
2964	2970	2972	2972	Hatch	77	" D ye see aught ? "
2974	2980	2982	2982	Dick	76	" Not a twig stirs , "
2984	2993	2995	2995	Bennet	77	" I think shame to leave him lying , "
3010	3040	2995	2995	Bennet	77	" Keep a good eye on the wood , Master Shelton keep a clear eye on the wood . The saints assoil us ! here was a good shoot ! "
3083	3091	3093	3093	Hatch	77	" Can ye hear , old Nick ? "
3095	3108	3093	3093	Hatch	77	" Have ye a last wish before ye wend , old brother ? "
3109	3125	3127	3127	Appleyard	84	" Pluck out the shaft , and let me pass , a Mary s name ! "
3129	3141	3127	3127	Appleyard	84	" I be done with Old England . Pluck it out ! "
3142	3146	3148	3148	Bennet	77	" Master Dick , "
3150	3173	3148	3148	Bennet	77	" come hither , and pull me a good pull upon the arrow . He would fain pass , the poor sinner . "
3308	3311	3312	3312	he	77	" Ay , "
3315	3323	3312	3312	he	77	" it ll be my turn next . "
3324	3332	3333	3333	Richard	74	" Who hath done this , Bennet ? "
3344	3351	3353	3353	Hatch	77	" Nay , the saints know , "
3355	3406	3353	3353	Hatch	77	" Here are a good two score Christian souls that we have hunted out of house and holding , he and I. He has paid his shot , poor shrew , nor will it be long , mayhap , ere I pay mine . Sir Daniel driveth over - hard . "
3407	3414	3416	3417	the lad	309	" This is a strange shaft , "
3427	3434	3436	3436	Bennet	77	" Ay , by my faith ! "
3438	3482	3436	3436	Bennet	77	" Black , and black - feathered . Here is an ill - favoured shaft , by my sooth ! for black , they say , bodes burial . And here be words written . Wipe the blood away . What read ye ? "
3483	3491	3493	3493	Shelton	74	" Appulyaird fro Jon Amend - All , "
3495	3501	3493	3493	Shelton	74	" What should this betoken ? "
3502	3510	3516	3516	his	329	" Nay , I like it not , "
3519	3601	3516	3516	his	329	" John Amend - All ! Here is a rogue s name for those that be up in the world ! But why stand we here to make a mark ? Take him by the knees , good Master Shelton , while I lift him by the shoulders , and let us lay him in his house . This will be a rare shog to poor Sir Oliver ; he will turn paper colour ; he will pray like a windmill . "
3719	3724	3725	3725	he	77	" Nick had money , "
3728	3866	3725	3725	he	77	" He may have had three score pounds put by . I would I could light upon t ! When ye lose an old friend , Master Richard , the best consolation is to heir him . See , now , this chest . I would go a mighty wager there is a bushel of gold therein . He had a strong hand to get , and a hard hand to keep withal , had Appleyard the archer . Now may God rest his spirit ! Near eighty year he was afoot and about , and ever getting ; but now he s on the broad of his back , poor shrew , and no more lacketh ; and if his chattels came to a good friend , he would be merrier , methinks , in heaven . "
3867	3872	3874	3874	Dick	76	" Come , Hatch , "
3876	3899	3874	3874	Dick	76	" respect his stone - blind eyes . Would ye rob the man before his body ? Nay , he would walk ! "
3977	3979	3980	3981	the newcomer	337	" Appleyard "
3994	3998	3999	3999	he	337	" Ave Maria ! "
4002	4013	3999	3999	he	337	" Saints be our shield ! What cheer is this ? "
4014	4023	4025	4025	Hatch	77	" Cold cheer with Appleyard , sir parson , "
4031	4063	4025	4025	Hatch	77	" Shot at his own door , and alighteth even now at purgatory gates . Ay ! there , if tales be true , he shall lack neither coal nor candle . "
4085	4097	4098	4098	he	77	" This is a judgment ! O , a great stroke ! "
4119	4124	4126	4127	the priest	338	" Ay , Bennet , "
4132	4145	4126	4127	the priest	338	" and what may this be ? What enemy hath done this ? "
4146	4165	4167	4167	Dick	76	" Here , Sir Oliver , is the arrow . See , it is written upon with words , "
4169	4172	4174	4175	the priest	338	" Nay , "
4177	4297	4174	4175	the priest	338	" this is a foul hearing ! John Amend - All ! A right Lollardy word . And black of hue , as for an omen ! Sirs , this knave arrow likes me not . But it importeth rather to take counsel . Who should this be ? Bethink you , Bennet . Of so many black ill - willers , which should he be that doth so hardily outface us ? Simnel ? I do much question it . The Walsinghams ? Nay , they are not yet so broken ; they still think to have the law over us , when times change . There was Simon Malmesbury , too . How think ye , Bennet ? "
4298	4305	4307	4307	Hatch	77	" What think ye , sir , "
4309	4314	4307	4307	Hatch	77	" of Ellis Duckworth ? "
4315	4327	4329	4330	the priest	338	" Nay , Bennet , never . Nay , not he , "
4332	4434	4329	4330	the priest	338	" There cometh never any rising , Bennet , from below so all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion ; but rebellion travelleth ever downward from above ; and when Dick , Tom , and Harry take them to their bills , look ever narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby . Now , Sir Daniel , having once more joined him to the Queen s party , is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords . Thence , Bennet , comes the blow by what procuring , I yet seek ; but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture . "
4435	4444	4446	4446	Bennet	77	" An t please you , Sir Oliver , "
4448	4621	4446	4446	Bennet	77	" the axles are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire . So did this poor sinner , Appleyard . And , by your leave , men s spirits are so foully inclined to all of us , that it needs neither York nor Lancaster to spur them on . Hear my plain thoughts : You , that are a clerk , and Sir Daniel , that sails on any wind , ye have taken many men s goods , and beaten and hanged not a few . Y are called to count for this ; in the end , I wot not how , ye have ever the uppermost at law , and ye think all patched . But give me leave , Sir Oliver : the man that ye have dispossessed and beaten is but the angrier , and some day , when the black devil is by , he will up with his bow and clout me a yard of arrow through your inwards . "
4622	4643	4645	4646	Sir Oliver	73	" Nay , Bennet , y are in the wrong . Bennet , ye should be glad to be corrected , "
4648	4679	4645	4646	Sir Oliver	73	" Y are a prater , Bennet , a talker , a babbler ; your mouth is wider than your two ears . Mend it , Bennet , mend it . "
4680	4694	4696	4697	the retainer	329	" Nay , I say no more . Have it as ye list , "
4772	4784	4786	4786	Hatch	77	" Tis time we were on the road , Sir Oliver , "
4799	4810	4812	4813	the parson	346	" Ay ; but , Bennet , things are changed , "
4815	4910	4812	4813	the parson	346	" There is now no Appleyard rest his soul ! to keep the garrison . I shall keep you , Bennet . I must have a good man to rest me on in this day of black arrows . The arrow that flieth by day , saith the evangel ; I have no mind of the context ; nay , I am a sluggard priest , I am too deep in men s affairs . Well , let us ride forth , Master Hatch . The jackmen should be at the church by now . "
5091	5113	5115	5116	the priest	338	" We have not done amiss , praised be the cross of Holywood ! Sir Daniel will be right well content , "
5123	5134	5136	5136	Bennet	77	" Who goes ? Stand ! if ye be true ! "
5357	5362	5364	5365	the priest	338	" Shoot ! shoot ! "
5371	5378	5380	5380	Bennet	77	" Cover him , Master Dick , "
5382	5392	5380	5380	Bennet	77	" Bring me him down like a ripe apple . "
5536	5544	5546	5546	Bennet	77	" And the plague go with him ! "
5548	5586	5546	5546	Bennet	77	" He has thieves heels ; he can run , by St Banbury ! But you touched him , Master Shelton ; he has stolen your quarrel , may he never have good I grudge him less ! "
5587	5598	5600	5601	Sir Oliver	73	" Nay , but what made he by the church ? "
5603	5633	5600	5601	Sir Oliver	73	" I am shrewdly afeared there has been mischief here . Clipsby , good fellow , get ye down from your horse , and search thoroughly among the yews . "
5648	5658	5659	5659	he	73	" This writing was pinned to the church door , "
5668	5677	5659	5659	he	73	" I found naught else , sir parson . "
5678	5688	5690	5691	Sir Oliver	73	" Now , by the power of Mother Church , "
5693	5784	5690	5691	Sir Oliver	73	" but this runs hard on sacrilege ! For the king s good pleasure , or the lord of the manor well ! But that every run - the - hedge in a green jerkin should fasten papers to the chancel door nay , it runs hard on sacrilege , hard ; and men have burned for matters of less weight . But what have we here ? The light falls apace . Good Master Richard , y have young eyes . Read me , I pray , this libel . "
5834	5867	5831	5831	they	391	" I had four blak arrows under my belt , Four for the greefs that I have felt , Four for the nomber of ill menne That have opressid me now and then .
5962	5976	5958	5958	yea	395	" Jon Amend - All of the Green Wood , And his jolly fellaweship .
5977	5994	5958	5958	yea	395	" Item , we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres of your following . "
5995	6010	6012	6013	Sir Oliver	73	" Now , well - a - day for charity and the Christian graces ! "
6017	6084	6012	6013	Sir Oliver	73	" Sirs , this is an ill world , and groweth daily worse . I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight s hurt , whether in act or purpose , as the babe unchristened . Neither was his throat cut ; for therein they are again in error , as there still live credible witnesses to show . "
6085	6093	6095	6095	Bennet	77	" It boots not , sir parson , "
6097	6103	6095	6095	Bennet	77	" Here is unseasonable talk . "
6104	6123	6125	6126	the priest	338	" Nay , Master Bennet , not so . Keep ye in your due place , good Bennet , "
6128	6184	6125	6126	the priest	338	" I shall make mine innocence appear . I will , upon no consideration , lose my poor life in error . I take all men to witness that I am clear of this matter . I was not even in the Moat House . I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock "
6185	6189	6191	6191	Hatch	77	" Sir Oliver , "
6195	6218	6191	6191	Hatch	77	" since it please you not to stop this sermon , I will take other means . Goffe , sound to horse . "
6517	6529	6530	6530	he	77	" Ye must go the long way about , Master Shelton , "
6533	6753	6530	6530	he	77	" round by the bridge , for your life ! Keep a sure man fifty paces afore you , to draw shots ; and go softly till y are past the wood . If the rogues fall upon you , ride for t ; ye will do naught by standing . And keep ever forward , Master Shelton ; turn me not back again , an ye love your life ; there is no help in Tunstall , mind ye that . And now , since ye go to the great wars about the king , and I continue to dwell here in extreme jeopardy of my life , and the saints alone can certify if we shall meet again below , I give you my last counsels now at your riding . Keep an eye on Sir Daniel ; he is unsure . Put not your trust in the jack - priest ; he intendeth not amiss , but doth the will of others ; it is a hand - gun for Sir Daniel ! Get your good lordship where ye go ; make you strong friends ; look to it . And think ever a pater - noster - while on Bennet Hatch . There are worse rogues afoot than Bennet . So , God - speed ! "
6754	6763	6765	6765	Dick	76	" And Heaven be with you , Bennet ! "
6767	6785	6765	6765	Dick	76	" Ye were a good friend to me - ward , and so I shall say ever . "
6786	6794	6796	6796	Hatch	77	" And , look ye , master , "
6803	6847	6796	6796	Hatch	77	" if this Amend - All should get a shaft into me , ye might , mayhap , lay out a gold mark or mayhap a pound for my poor soul ; for it is like to go stiff with me in purgatory . "
6848	6859	6861	6861	Dick	76	" Ye shall have your will of it , Bennet , "
6863	6887	6861	6861	Dick	76	" But , what cheer , man ! we shall meet again , where ye shall have more need of ale than masses . "
6888	6898	6900	6901	the other	311	" The saints so grant it , Master Dick ! "
6903	6936	6900	6901	the other	311	" But here comes Sir Oliver . An he were as quick with the long - bow as with the pen , he would be a brave man - at - arms . "
6949	6968	6940	6940	Dick	76	" To my ryght worchypful master , Sir Daniel Brackley , knyght , be thys delyvered in haste . "
7328	7337	7338	7339	Sir Daniel	75	" Now , mark me , mine host , "
7342	7426	7338	7339	Sir Daniel	75	" follow but mine orders , and I shall be your good lord ever . I must have good men for head boroughs , and I will have Adam - a - More high constable ; see to it narrowly . If other men be chosen , it shall avail you nothing ; rather it shall be found to your sore cost . For those that have paid rent to Walsingham I shall take good measure you among the rest , mine host . "
7427	7431	7433	7434	the host	435	" Good knight , "
7436	7498	7433	7434	the host	435	" I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I did but pay to Walsingham upon compulsion . Nay , bully knight , I love not the rogue Walsinghams ; they were as poor as thieves , bully knight . Give me a great lord like you . Nay ; ask me among the neighbours , I am stout for Brackley . "
7499	7504	7506	7507	Sir Daniel	72	" It may be , "
7511	7518	7506	7507	Sir Daniel	72	" Ye shall then pay twice . "
7557	7565	7567	7568	the knight	438	" Bring up yon fellow , Selden ! "
7598	7601	7603	7604	Sir Daniel	72	" Sirrah , "
7606	7610	7603	7604	Sir Daniel	72	" your name ? "
7611	7618	7620	7621	the man	3175	" An t please your worship , "
7623	7639	7620	7621	the man	3175	" my name is Condall Condall of Shoreby , at your good worship s pleasure . "
7640	7649	7651	7652	the knight	438	" I have heard you ill reported on , "
7654	7694	7651	7652	the knight	438	" Ye deal in treason , rogue ; ye trudge the country leasing ; y are heavily suspicioned of the death of severals . How , fellow , are ye so bold ? But I will bring you down . "
7695	7703	7704	7705	the man	3175	" Right honourable and my reverend lord , "
7708	7734	7704	7705	the man	3175	" here is some hodge - podge , saving your good presence . I am but a poor private man , and have hurt none . "
7735	7747	7749	7750	the knight	438	" The under - sheriff did report of you most vilely , "
7752	7764	7749	7750	the knight	438	" Seize me , saith he , that Tyndal of Shoreby . "
7765	7778	7780	7781	the unfortunate	446	" Condall , my good lord ; Condall is my poor name , "
7783	7793	7795	7796	Sir Daniel	72	" Condall or Tyndal , it is all one , "
7800	7834	7795	7796	Sir Daniel	72	" For , by my sooth , y are here and I do mightily suspect your honesty . If ye would save your neck , write me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound . "
7835	7844	7846	7846	Condall	110	" For twenty pound , my good lord ! "
7848	7863	7846	7846	Condall	110	" Here is midsummer madness ! My whole estate amounteth not to seventy shillings . "
7864	7869	7871	7872	Sir Daniel	72	" Condall or Tyndal , "
7876	7914	7871	7872	Sir Daniel	72	" I will run my peril of that loss . Write me down twenty , and when I have recovered all I may , I will be good lord to you , and pardon you the rest . "
7915	7934	7936	7936	Condall	110	" Alas ! my good lord , it may not be ; I have no skill to write , "
7938	7945	7947	7948	the knight	438	" Well - a - day ! "
7950	8030	7947	7948	the knight	438	" Here , then , is no remedy . Yet I would fain have spared you , Tyndal , had my conscience suffered . Selden , take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm , and hang me him tenderly by the neck , where I may see him at my riding . Fare ye well , good Master Condall , dear Master Tyndal ; y are post - haste for Paradise ; fare ye then well ! "
8031	8039	8041	8041	Condall	110	" Nay , my right pleasant lord , "
8048	8077	8041	8041	Condall	110	" an ye be so masterful , as doth right well become you , I will even , with all my poor skill , do your good bidding . "
8078	8081	7947	7948	the knight	438	" Friend , "
8086	8125	8083	8084	Sir Daniel	72	" ye will now write two score . Go to ! y are too cunning for a livelihood of seventy shillings . Selden , see him write me this in good form , and have it duly witnessed . "
8179	8182	8184	8185	Sir Daniel	72	" Hither , "
8208	8213	8214	8214	he	72	" By the rood ! "
8217	8222	8214	8214	he	72	" a sturdy boy ! "
8296	8305	8306	8306	he	72	" Ye have called me , Sir Daniel , "
8309	8319	8306	8306	he	72	" Was it to laugh at my poor plight ? "
8320	8328	8330	8331	the knight	438	" Nay , now , let laugh , "
8333	8358	8330	8331	the knight	438	" Good shrew , let laugh , I pray you . An ye could see yourself , I warrant ye would laugh the first . "
8359	8362	8364	8365	the lad	309	" Well , "
8369	8387	8364	8365	the lad	309	" ye shall answer this when ye answer for the other . Laugh while yet ye may ! "
8388	8396	8398	8399	Sir Daniel	72	" Nay , now , good cousin , "
8405	8536	8398	8399	Sir Daniel	72	" think not that I mock at you , except in mirth , as between kinsfolk and singular friends . I will make you a marriage of a thousand pounds , go to ! and cherish you exceedingly . I took you , indeed , roughly , as the time demanded ; but from henceforth I shall ungrudgingly maintain and cheerfully serve you . Ye shall be Mrs. Shelton Lady Shelton , by my troth ! for the lad promiseth bravely . Tut ! ye will not shy for honest laughter ; it purgeth melancholy . They are no rogues who laugh , good cousin . Good mine host , lay me a meal now for my cousin , Master John . Sit ye down , sweetheart , and eat . "
8537	8540	8542	8543	Master John	113	" Nay , "
8545	8598	8542	8543	Master John	113	" I will break no bread . Since ye force me to this sin , I will fast for my soul s interest . But , good mine host , I pray you of courtesy give me a cup of fair water ; I shall be much beholden to your courtesy indeed . "
8599	8609	8611	8612	the knight	438	" Ye shall have a dispensation , go to ! "
8614	8632	8611	8612	the knight	438	" Shalt be well shriven , by my faith ! Content you , then , and eat . "
8713	8720	8721	8721	he	74	" Save you , Sir Daniel , "
8724	8730	8732	8733	the knight	438	" How ! Dickie Shelton ! "
8750	8756	8743	8745	the other lad	461	" What maketh Bennet Hatch ? "
8757	8781	8783	8783	Richard	74	" Please you , sir knight , to take cognisance of this packet from Sir Oliver , wherein are all things fully stated , "
8791	8838	8783	8783	Richard	74	" And please you farther , ye were best make all speed to Risingham ; for on the way hither we encountered one riding furiously with letters , and by his report , my Lord of Risingham was sore bested , and lacked exceedingly your presence . "
8839	8847	8849	8850	the knight	438	" How say you ? Sore bested ? "
8852	8932	8849	8850	the knight	438	" Nay , then , we will make speed sitting down , good Richard . As the world goes in this poor realm of England , he that rides softliest rides surest . Delay , they say , begetteth peril ; but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men ; mark it , Dick . But let me see , first , what cattle ye have brought . Selden , a link here at the door ! "
9020	9027	9028	9028	he	72	" Nay , by the rood ! "
9031	9155	9028	9028	he	72	" what poor dogs are these ? Here be some as crooked as a bow , and some as lean as a spear . Friends , ye shall ride in the front of the battle ; I can spare you , friends . Mark me this old villain on the piebald ! A two - year mutton riding on a hog would look more soldierly ! Ha ! Clipsby , are ye there , old rat ? Y are a man I could lose with a good heart ; ye shall go in front of all , with a bull s eye painted on your jack , to be the better butt for archery ; sirrah , ye shall show me the way . "
9156	9174	9176	9176	Clipsby	80	" I will show you any way , Sir Daniel , but the way to change sides , "
9186	9192	9193	9193	he	72	" Why , well said ! "
9196	9228	9193	9193	he	72	" Hast a shrewd tongue in thy mouth , go to ! I will forgive you for that merry word . Selden , see them fed , both man and brute . "
9237	9243	9244	9244	he	438	" Now , friend Dick , "
9247	9265	9244	9244	he	438	" fall to . Here is good ale and bacon . Eat , while that I read . "
9299	9302	9304	9304	he	72	" Dick , "
9306	9314	9304	9304	he	72	" Y have seen this penny rhyme ? "
9322	9330	9332	9333	the knight	438	" It bears your father s name , "
9335	9355	9332	9333	the knight	438	" and our poor shrew of a parson is , by some mad soul , accused of slaying him . "
9356	9364	9366	9366	Dick	76	" He did most eagerly deny it , "
9368	9372	9374	9375	the knight	438	" He did ? "
9380	9446	9374	9375	the knight	438	" Heed him not . He has a loose tongue ; he babbles like a jack - sparrow . Some day , when I may find the leisure , Dick , I will myself more fully inform you of these matters . There was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it ; but the times were troubled , and there was no justice to be got . "
9447	9455	9456	9456	Dick	76	" It befell at the Moat House ? "
9466	9476	9478	9479	Sir Daniel	72	" It befell between the Moat House and Holywood , "
9499	9503	9505	9506	the knight	438	" And now , "
9508	9526	9505	9506	the knight	438	" speed you with your meal ; ye shall return to Tunstall with a line from me . "
9533	9539	9540	9540	he	438	" Prithee , Sir Daniel , "
9543	9569	9540	9540	he	438	" send one of the villains ! I beseech you let me to the battle . I can strike a stroke , I promise you . "
9570	9576	9578	9579	Sir Daniel	72	" I misdoubt it not , "
9586	9687	9578	9579	Sir Daniel	72	" But here , Dick , is no honour to be won . I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war , and then ride to join me with the conqueror . Cry not on cowardice ; it is but wisdom , Dick ; for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion , and the king s name and custody so changeth hands , that no man may be certain of the morrow . Toss - pot and Shuttle - wit run in , but my Lord Good - Counsel sits o one side , waiting . "
9769	9780	9782	9783	the voice	478	" Make not a sign , I do beseech you , "
9785	9829	9782	9783	the voice	478	" but of your charity tell me the straight way to Holywood . Beseech you , now , good boy , comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress , and set me so far forth upon the way to my repose . "
9830	9838	9840	9840	Dick	76	" Take the path by the windmill , "
9847	9860	9840	9840	Dick	76	" it will bring you to Till Ferry ; there inquire again . "
9897	9900	9902	9902	Dick	76	" Why , "
9904	9956	9902	9902	Dick	76	" he is a young as I. Good boy doth he call me ? An I had known , I should have seen the varlet hanged ere I had told him . Well , if he goes through the fen , I may come up with him and pull his ears . "
10005	10009	10010	10011	the messenger	484	" Sir Daniel , "
10014	10089	10010	10011	the messenger	484	" ye lose great honour , by my sooth ! The fight began again this morning ere the dawn , and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing . Only the main battle standeth fast . An we had your fresh men , we should tilt you them all into the river . What , sir knight ! Will ye be the last ? It stands not with your good credit . "
10090	10093	10095	10096	the knight	438	" Nay , "
10098	10163	10095	10096	the knight	438	" I was but now upon the march . Selden , sound me the tucket . Sir , I am with you on the instant . It is not two hours since the more part of my command came in , sir messenger . What would ye have ? Spurring is good meat , but yet it killed the charger . Bustle , boys ! "
10292	10304	10305	10305	he	72	" Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch , "
10308	10316	10318	10319	the messenger	484	" They are pretty men , indeed , "
10321	10335	10318	10319	the messenger	484	" It but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier . "
10336	10339	10341	10342	the knight	438	" Well , "
10344	10364	10366	10366	he	72	" what would ye ? The beginning of a feast and the end of a fray , sir messenger ; "
10372	10378	10379	10379	he	72	" Why ! how now ! "
10382	10405	10379	10379	he	72	" John ! Joanna ! Nay , by the sacred rood ! where is she ? Host , where is that girl ? "
10406	10412	10414	10415	the landlord	496	" Girl , Sir Daniel ? "
10417	10427	10414	10415	the landlord	496	" Nay , sir , I saw no girl . "
10428	10435	10437	10438	the knight	438	" Boy , then , dotard ! "
10440	10470	10437	10438	the knight	438	" Could ye not see it was a wench ? She in the murrey - coloured mantle she that broke her fast with water , rogue where is she ? "
10471	10486	10488	10489	the host	435	" Nay , the saints bless us ! Master John , ye called him , "
10491	10525	10488	10489	the host	435	" Well , I thought none evil . He is gone . I saw him her I saw her in the stable a good hour agone ; a was saddling a grey horse . "
10526	10533	10535	10536	Sir Daniel	72	" Now , by the rood ! "
10538	10551	10535	10536	Sir Daniel	72	" the wench was worth five hundred pound to me and more . "
10552	10556	10558	10559	the messenger	484	" Sir knight , "
10564	10588	10558	10559	the messenger	484	" while that ye are here , roaring for five hundred pounds , the realm of England is elsewhere being lost and won . "
10589	10595	10597	10598	Sir Daniel	72	" It is well said , "
10600	10654	10597	10598	Sir Daniel	72	" Selden , fall me out with six cross - bowmen ; hunt me her down . I care not what it cost ; but , at my returning , let me find her at the Moat House . Be it upon your head . And now , sir messenger , we march . "
11153	11156	11158	11158	Dick	76	" Alack ! "
11160	11210	11158	11158	Dick	76	" can the poor lad have perished ? There is his horse , for certain a brave grey ! Nay , comrade , if thou criest to me so piteously , I will do all man can to help thee . Shalt not lie there to drown by inches ! "
11260	11271	11272	11272	he	76	" I would I had dared to tell him further , "
11275	11286	11272	11272	he	76	" for I fear he has miscarried in the slough . "
11326	11331	11332	11332	he	76	" Are ye there ? "
11338	11401	11332	11332	he	76	" Ye lay so close among the reeds that I had passed you by . I saw your horse bemired , and put him from his agony ; which , by my sooth ! an ye had been a more merciful rider , ye had done yourself . But come forth out of your hiding . Here be none to trouble you . "
11402	11422	11424	11425	the other	311	" Nay , good boy , I have no arms , nor skill to use them if I had , "
11433	11439	11441	11441	Dick	76	" Why call me boy ? "
11443	11457	11441	11441	Dick	76	" Y are not , I trow , the elder of us twain . "
11458	11463	11465	11466	the other	311	" Good Master Shelton , "
11468	11537	11538	11538	he	76	" prithee forgive me . I have none the least intention to offend . Rather I would in every way beseech your gentleness and favour , for I am now worse bested than ever , having lost my way , my cloak , and my poor horse . To have a riding - rod and spurs , and never a horse to sit upon ! And before all , "
11546	11556	11441	11441	Dick	76	" before all , to be so sorrily besmirched ! "
11557	11560	11562	11562	Dick	76	" Tut ! "
11564	11585	11562	11562	Dick	76	" Would ye mind a ducking ? Blood of wound or dust of travel that s a man s adornment . "
11586	11597	11599	11600	the lad	309	" Nay , then , I like him better plain , "
11602	11637	11599	11600	the lad	309	" But , prithee , how shall I do ? Prithee , good Master Richard , help me with your good counsel . If I come not safe to Holywood , I am undone . "
11638	11641	11643	11643	Dick	76	" Nay , "
11647	11688	11643	11643	Dick	76	" I will give more than counsel . Take my horse , and I will run awhile , and when I am weary we shall change again , that so , riding and running , both may go the speedier . "
11719	11726	11728	11728	Dick	76	" How call ye your name ? "
11730	11736	11738	11739	the lad	309	" Call me John Matcham , "
11741	11749	11750	11750	Dick	76	" And what make ye to Holywood ? "
11753	11765	11750	11750	Dick	76	" I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me , "
11770	11784	11750	11750	Dick	76	" The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong pillar to the weak . "
11785	11797	11799	11799	Dick	76	" And how came ye with Sir Daniel , Master Matcham ? "
11801	11804	11806	11807	the other	311	" Nay , "
11809	11904	11806	11807	the other	311	" by the abuse of force ! He hath taken me by violence from my own place ; dressed me in these weeds ; ridden with me till my heart was sick ; gibed me till I could a wept ; and when certain of my friends pursued , thinking to have me back , claps me in the rear to stand their shot ! I was even grazed in the right foot , and walk but lamely . Nay , there shall come a day between us ; he shall smart for all ! "
11905	11918	11920	11920	Dick	76	" Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand - gun ? "
11922	11954	11920	11920	Dick	76	" Tis a valiant knight , and hath a hand of iron . An he guessed I had made or meddled with your flight , it would go sore with me . "
11955	11961	11963	11964	the other	311	" Ay , poor boy , "
11966	12013	11963	11964	the other	311	" y are his ward , I know it . By the same token , so am I , or so he saith ; or else he hath bought my marriage I wot not rightly which ; but it is some handle to oppress me by . "
12014	12018	12020	12020	Dick	76	" Boy again ! "
12022	12036	12038	12038	Matcham	120	" Nay , then , shall I call you girl , good Richard ? "
12040	12047	12049	12049	Dick	76	" Never a girl for me , "
12051	12060	12049	12049	Dick	76	" I do abjure the crew of them ! "
12061	12066	12068	12069	the other	311	" Ye speak boyishly , "
12071	12081	12068	12069	the other	311	" Ye think more of them than ye pretend . "
12082	12086	12088	12088	Dick	76	" Not I , "
12092	12166	12088	12088	Dick	76	" They come not in my mind . A plague of them , say I ! Give me to hunt and to fight and to feast , and to live with jolly foresters . I never heard of a maid yet that was for any service , save one only ; and she , poor shrew , was burned for a witch and the wearing of men s clothes in spite of nature . "
12179	12184	12185	12185	Dick	76	" What make ye ? "
12188	12195	12197	12198	the other	311	" I pray for her spirit , "
12206	12213	12214	12214	Dick	76	" For a witch s spirit ? "
12217	12267	12214	12214	Dick	76	" But pray for her , an ye list ; she was the best wench in Europe , was this Joan of Arc . Old Appleyard the archer ran from her , he said , as if she had been Mahoun . Nay , she was a brave wench . "
12268	12277	12279	12279	Matcham	120	" Well , but , good Master Richard , "
12281	12322	12279	12279	Matcham	120	" an ye like maids so little , y are no true natural man ; for God made them twain by intention , and brought true love into the world , to be man s hope and woman s comfort . "
12323	12326	12328	12328	Dick	76	" Faugh ! "
12330	12383	12328	12328	Dick	76	" Y are a milk - sopping baby , so to harp on women . An ye think I be no true man , get down upon the path , and whether at fists , back - sword , or bow and arrow , I will prove my manhood on your body . "
12384	12392	12394	12394	Matcham	120	" Nay , I am no fighter , "
12398	12428	12394	12394	Matcham	120	" I mean no tittle of offence . I meant but pleasantry . And if I talk of women , it is because I heard ye were to marry . "
12429	12434	12435	12435	Dick	76	" I to marry ! "
12438	12458	12435	12435	Dick	76	" Well , it is the first I hear of it . And with whom was I to marry ? "
12459	12464	12466	12466	Matcham	120	" One Joan Sedley , "
12470	12519	12466	12466	Matcham	120	" It was Sir Daniel s doing ; he hath money to gain upon both sides ; and , indeed , I have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match . It seems she is of your mind , or else distasted to the bridegroom . "
12520	12533	12535	12535	Dick	76	" Well ! marriage is like death , it comes to all , "
12540	12616	12535	12535	Dick	76	" And she bemoaned herself ? I pray ye now , see there how shuttle - witted are these girls : to bemoan herself before that she had seen me ! Do I bemoan myself ? Not I. An I be to marry , I will marry dry - eyed ! But if ye know her , prithee , of what favour is she ? fair or foul ? And is she shrewish or pleasant ? "
12617	12624	12626	12626	Matcham	120	" Nay , what matters it ? "
12628	12669	12626	12626	Matcham	120	" An y are to marry , ye can but marry . What matters foul or fair ? These be but toys . Y are no milksop , Master Richard ; ye will we d with dry eyes , anyhow . "
12670	12676	12678	12678	Shelton	74	" It is well said , "
12680	12685	12678	12678	Shelton	74	" Little I reck . "
12686	12698	12700	12700	Matcham	120	" Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord , "
12702	12713	12715	12715	Dick	76	" She shall have the lord Heaven made her for , "
12717	12728	12715	12715	Dick	76	" It trow there be worse as well as better . "
12729	12736	12738	12739	the other	311	" Ah , the poor wench ! "
12741	12747	12749	12749	Dick	76	" And why so poor ? "
12751	12760	12762	12763	his companion	540	" To we d a man of wood , "
12765	12774	12762	12763	his companion	540	" O me , for a wooden husband ! "
12775	12787	12789	12789	Dick	76	" I think I be a man of wood , indeed , "
12791	12811	12789	12789	Dick	76	" to trudge afoot the while you ride my horse ; but it is good wood , I trow . "
12812	12819	12821	12822	the other	311	" Good Dick , forgive me , "
12824	12846	12821	12822	the other	311	" Nay , y are the best heart in England ; I but laughed . Forgive me now , sweet Dick . "
12847	12854	12856	12856	Dick	76	" Nay , no fool words , "
12867	12882	12856	12856	Dick	76	" No harm is done . I am not touchy , praise the saints . "
12911	12914	12916	12916	Dick	76	" Hark ! "
12918	12923	12916	12916	Dick	76	" the tucket soundeth . "
12924	12927	12929	12929	Matcham	120	" Ay , "
12931	12944	12946	12946	he	120	" they have found my flight , and now I am unhorsed ! "
12952	12958	12960	12960	Dick	76	" Nay , what cheer ! "
12962	12987	12960	12960	Dick	76	" Y have a long start , and we are near the ferry . And it is I , methinks , that am unhorsed . "
12988	12996	12998	12999	the fugitive	378	" Alack , I shall be taken ! "
13001	13015	12998	12999	the fugitive	378	" Dick , kind Dick , beseech ye help me but a little ! "
13016	13025	13027	13027	Dick	76	" Why , now , what aileth thee ? "
13029	13136	13027	13027	Dick	76	" Methinks I help you very patently . But my heart is sorry for so spiritless a fellow ! And see ye here , John Matcham sith John Matcham is your name I , Richard Shelton , tide what betideth , come what may , will see you safe in Holywood . The saints so do to me again if I default you . Come , pick me up a good heart , Sir White - face . The way betters here ; spur me the horse . Go faster ! faster ! Nay , mind not for me ; I can run like a deer . "
13342	13348	13349	13349	he	76	" Hey , Master Shelton , "
13352	13389	13349	13349	he	76	" be ye for the ferry ? Ill times , ill times ! Look to yourself . There is a fellowship abroad . Ye were better turn round on your two heels and try the bridge . "
13390	13399	13401	13401	Dick	76	" Nay ; time s in the saddle , "
13403	13417	13401	13401	Dick	76	" Time will ride , Hugh Ferryman . I am hot in haste . "
13418	13423	13425	13426	the ferryman	559	" A wilful man ! "
13430	13451	13425	13426	the ferryman	559	" An ye win safe to the Moat House , y have done lucky ; but I say no more . "
13459	13464	13465	13465	he	76	" Who be this ? "
13481	13490	13492	13492	Dick	76	" It is my kinsman , Master Matcham , "
13494	13503	13505	13505	Matcham	120	" Give ye good day , good ferryman , "
13520	13535	13505	13505	Matcham	120	" Launch me your boat , I prithee ; we are sore in haste . "
13542	13547	13548	13548	he	563	" By the mass ! "
13584	13590	13591	13591	he	563	" How now , churl ! "
13594	13606	13591	13591	he	563	" Fall to thy business , and leave mocking thy betters . "
13636	13645	13647	13647	Hugh	125	" Ye be mortal small made , master , "
13654	13673	13674	13674	he	125	" something o the wrong model , belike . Nay , Master Shelton , I am for you , "
13682	13704	13674	13674	he	125	" A cat may look at a king . I did but take a shot of the eye at Master Matcham . "
13705	13712	13714	13714	Dick	76	" Sirrah , no more words , "
13716	13722	13714	13714	Dick	76	" Bend me your back . "
13781	13785	13787	13788	the ferryman	559	" My master , "
13798	13853	13787	13788	the ferryman	559	" I have a shrew guess that John - a - Fenne is on the island . He bears me a black grudge to all Sir Daniel s. How if I turned me up stream and landed you an arrow - flight above the path ? Ye were best not meddle with John Fenne . "
13854	13865	13867	13867	Dick	76	" How , then ? is he of this company ? "
13869	13877	13879	13879	Hugh	125	" Nay , mum is the word , "
13881	13900	13902	13902	he	125	" But I would go up water , Dick . How if Master Matcham came by an arrow ? "
13906	13913	13915	13915	Dick	76	" Be it so , Hugh , "
13917	13923	13925	13925	Hugh	125	" Look ye , then , "
13927	13965	13925	13925	Hugh	125	" Sith it shall so be , unsling me your cross - bow so : now make it ready good ; place me a quarrel . Ay , keep it so , and look upon me grimly . "
13966	13971	13973	13973	Dick	76	" What meaneth this ? "
13975	13995	13997	13998	the ferryman	559	" Why , my master , if I steal you across , it must be under force or fear , "
14000	14022	13997	13998	the ferryman	559	" for else , if John Fenne got wind of it , he were like to prove my most distressful neighbour . "
14023	14031	14032	14032	Dick	76	" Do these churls ride so roughly ? "
14035	14045	14032	14032	Dick	76	" Do they command Sir Daniel s own ferry ? "
14046	14049	14051	14052	the ferryman	559	" Nay , "
14056	14076	14078	14078	he	559	" Mark me ! Sir Daniel shall down . His time is out . He shall down . Mum ! "
14119	14129	14130	14130	he	125	" I must land you here among the willows , "
14133	14144	14146	14146	Dick	76	" Here is no path but willow swamps and quagmires , "
14148	14152	14154	14154	Hugh	125	" Master Shelton , "
14156	14279	14154	14154	Hugh	125	" I dare not take ye nearer down , for your own sake now . He watcheth me the ferry , lying on his bow . All that go by and owe Sir Daniel goodwill , he shooteth down like rabbits . I heard him swear it by the rood . An I had not known you of old days ay , and from so high upward I would a let you go on ; but for old days remembrance , and because ye had this toy with you that s not fit for wounds or warfare , I did risk my two poor ears to have you over whole . Content you ; I can no more , on my salvation ! "
14318	14322	14324	14324	Hugh	125	" A murrain ! "
14326	14337	14338	14338	He	125	" He was on the upper island all the while ! "
14344	14360	14361	14361	he	125	" Threat me with your bow , good Dick ; threat me with it plain , "
14364	14377	14361	14361	he	125	" I have tried to save your skins , save you mine ! "
14474	14487	14489	14489	Dick	76	" It may not be , Hugh ; here is no landing , "
14552	14556	14557	14557	he	590	" Who goes ? "
14560	14566	14557	14557	he	590	" Hugh , who goes ? "
14567	14574	14576	14577	the ferryman	559	" Tis Master Shelton , John , "
14579	14585	14587	14588	the man	3175	" Stand , Dick Shelton ! "
14593	14612	14587	14588	the man	3175	" Ye shall have no hurt , upon the rood ! Stand ! Back out , Hugh Ferryman . "
14619	14629	14631	14632	the man	3175	" Nay , then , ye shall go afoot , "
14736	14741	14743	14743	Dick	76	" By the mass ! "
14751	14768	14743	14743	Dick	76	" that makes a life I owe you . I swim like a cannon - ball . "
14812	14817	14819	14819	Shelton	76	" Come , Jack , "
14821	14851	14819	14819	Shelton	76	" run for it ! Ere Hugh can hale his barge across , or the pair of em can get it righted , we may be out of cry . "
14971	14977	14978	14978	he	128	" Leave me , Dick ! "
14983	14989	14978	14978	he	128	" I can no more . "
15002	15010	15011	15011	he	76	" Nay , Jack , leave thee ! "
15014	15070	15011	15011	he	76	" That were a knave s trick , to be sure , when ye risked a shot and a ducking , ay , and a drowning too , to save my life . Drowning , in sooth ; for why I did not pull you in along with me , the saints alone can tell ! "
15071	15074	15076	15076	Matcham	128	" Nay , "
15078	15094	15076	15076	Matcham	128	" I would a saved us both , good Dick , for I can swim . "
15095	15100	15102	15102	Dick	76	" Can ye so ? "
15143	15146	15147	15147	he	76	" Well , "
15150	15188	15147	15147	he	76	" here is a lesson to despise no man . I promised to care for you as far as Holywood , and , by the rood , Jack , y are more capable to care for me . "
15189	15199	15201	15201	Matcham	128	" Well , Dick , we re friends now , "
15203	15211	15213	15213	Dick	76	" Nay , I never was unfriends , "
15215	15263	15213	15213	Dick	76	" Y are a brave lad in your way , albeit something of a milksop , too . I never met your like before this day . But , prithee , fetch back your breath , and let us on . Here is no place for chatter . "
15264	15270	15272	15272	Matcham	128	" My foot hurts shrewdly , "
15274	15283	15285	15285	Dick	76	" Nay , I had forgot your foot , "
15287	15394	15285	15285	Dick	76	" Well , we must go the gentlier . I would I knew rightly where we were . I have clean lost the path ; yet that may be for the better , too . An they watch the ferry , they watch the path , belike , as well . I would Sir Daniel were back with two score men ; he would sweep me these rascals as the wind sweeps leaves . Come , Jack , lean ye on my shoulder , ye poor shrew . Nay , y are not tall enough . What age are ye , for a wager ? twelve ? "
15395	15402	15404	15404	Matcham	128	" Nay , I am sixteen , "
15406	15416	15418	15418	Dick	76	" Y are poorly grown to height , then , "
15420	15453	15418	15418	Dick	76	" But take my hand . We shall go softly , never fear . I owe you a life ; I am a good repayer , Jack , of good or evil . "
15463	15474	15476	15476	Dick	76	" We must hit the road , early or late , "
15478	15516	15517	15517	he	76	" and then for a fresh start . By the mass ! but y ave a rickety hand , Jack . If I had a hand like that , I would think shame . I tell you , "
15526	15542	15517	15517	he	76	" I swear by the mass I believe Hugh Ferryman took you for a maid . "
15543	15548	15550	15551	the other	311	" Nay , never ! "
15556	15566	15567	15567	Dick	76	" A did , though , for a wager ! "
15570	15623	15567	15567	Dick	76	" Small blame to him . Ye look liker maid than man ; and I tell you more y are a strange - looking rogue for a boy ; but for a hussy , Jack , ye would be right fair ye would . Ye would be well favoured for a wench . "
15624	15627	15629	15629	Matcham	128	" Well , "
15631	15641	15629	15629	Matcham	128	" ye know right well that I am none . "
15642	15654	15656	15656	Dick	76	" Nay , I know that ; I do but jest , "
15658	15729	15656	15656	Dick	76	" Ye ll be a man before your mother , Jack . What cheer , my bully ! Ye shall strike shrewd strokes . Now , which , I marvel , of you or me , shall be first knighted , Jack ? for knighted I shall be , or die for t. Sir Richard Shelton , Knight : it soundeth bravely . But Sir John Matcham soundeth not amiss . "
15730	15740	15742	15743	the other	311	" Prithee , Dick , stop till I drink , "
15766	15788	15742	15743	the other	311	" And O , Dick , if I might come by anything to eat ! my very heart aches with hunger . "
15789	15801	15803	15803	Dick	76	" Why , fool , did ye not eat at Kettley ? "
15805	15821	15823	15823	Matcham	119	" I had made a vow it was a sin I had been led into , "
15825	15842	15823	15823	Matcham	119	" but now , if it were but dry bread , I would eat it greedily . "
15843	15852	15854	15854	Dick	76	" Sit ye , then , and eat , "
15856	15868	15854	15854	Dick	76	" while that I scout a little forward for the road . "
16617	16625	16627	16627	Dick	76	" Let us try to the left , "
16629	16638	16627	16627	Dick	76	" We had near fallen foully , Jack . "
16649	16661	16662	16662	Dick	76	" Here is a piece of forest that I know not , "
16665	16672	16662	16662	Dick	76	" Where goeth me this track ? "
16673	16679	16681	16681	Matcham	128	" Let us even try , "
16747	16753	16755	16755	Matcham	128	" What may this be ? "
16757	16768	16770	16770	Dick	76	" Nay , by the mass , I know not , "
16772	16784	16770	16770	Dick	76	" I am all at sea . Let us go warily . "
16940	16946	16948	16948	Dick	76	" Now I bethink me , "
16950	16996	16948	16948	Dick	76	" this must be Grimstone . It was a hold of one Simon Malmesbury ; Sir Daniel was his bane ! Twas Bennet Hatch that burned it , now five years agone . In sooth , twas pity , for it was a fair house . "
17031	17034	17035	17035	he	128	" Hist ! "
17083	17136	17068	17068	his	661	" Then up and spake the master , the king of the outlaws : What make ye here , my merry men , among the greenwood shaws ? And Gamelyn made answer he looked never adown : O , they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town ! "
17520	17537	17538	17538	he	677	" O , they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town , "
17551	17584	17538	17538	he	677	" O , sir , we walk not here at all an evil thing to do . But if we meet with the good king s deer to shoot a shaft into . "
17664	17670	17671	17671	he	677	" How now , brother ? "
17674	17677	17671	17671	he	677	" Dinner ? "
17678	17683	17685	17686	the cook	680	" Ay , sot , "
17688	17781	17685	17686	the cook	680	" dinner it is , and a dry dinner , too , with neither ale nor bread . But there is little pleasure in the greenwood now ; time was when a good fellow could live here like a mitred abbot , set aside the rain and the white frosts ; he had his heart s desire both of ale and wine . But now are men s spirits dead ; and this John Amend - All , save us and guard us ! but a stuffed booby to scare crows withal . "
17782	17785	17787	17788	the other	311	" Nay , "
17790	17812	17787	17788	the other	311	" y are too set on meat and drinking , Lawless . Bide ye a bit ; the good time cometh . "
17813	17817	17819	17820	the cook	680	" Look ye , "
17822	17918	17819	17820	the cook	680	" I have even waited for this good time sith that I was so high . I have been a grey friar ; I have been a king s archer ; I have been a shipman , and sailed the salt seas ; and I have been in greenwood before this , forsooth ! and shot the king s deer . What cometh of it ? Naught ! I were better to have bided in the cloister . John Abbot availeth more than John Amend - All . By r Lady ! here they come . "
18128	18131	18132	18132	he	687	" Lads ! "
18135	18192	18132	18132	he	687	" good fellows all , and my right merry friends , y have sung this while on a dry whistle and lived at little ease . But what said I ever ? Abide Fortune constantly ; she turneth , turneth swift . And lo ! here is her little firstling even that good creature , ale ! "
18212	18220	18221	18222	the man	3175	" And now haste ye , boys , "
18225	18396	18221	18222	the man	3175	" There is work toward . A handful of archers are but now come to the ferry ; murrey and blue is their wear ; they are our butts they shall all taste arrows no man of them shall struggle through this wood . For , lads , we are here some fifty strong , each man of us most foully wronged ; for some they have lost lands , and some friends ; and some they have been outlawed all oppressed ! Who , then , hath done this evil ? Sir Daniel , by the rood ! Shall he then profit ? shall he sit snug in our houses ? shall he till our fields ? shall he suck the bone he robbed us of ? I trow not . He getteth him strength at law ; he gaineth cases ; nay , there is one case he shall not gain I have a writ here at my belt that , please the saints , shall conquer him . "
18423	18427	18428	18428	he	690	" Master Ellis , "
18431	18495	18428	18428	he	690	" y are for vengeance well it becometh you ! but your poor brother o the greenwood , that had never lands to lose nor friends to think upon , looketh rather , for his poor part , to the profit of the thing . He had liever a gold noble and a pottle of canary wine than all the vengeances in purgatory . "
18496	18499	18501	18502	the other	311	" Lawless , "
18504	18592	18501	18502	the other	311	" to reach the Moat House , Sir Daniel must pass the forest . We shall make that passage dearer , pardy , than any battle . Then , when he hath got to earth with such ragged handful as escapeth us all his great friends fallen and fled away , and none to give him aid we shall beleaguer that old fox about , and great shall be the fall of him . Tis a fat buck ; he will make a dinner for us all . "
18593	18596	18598	18598	Lawless	132	" Ay , "
18600	18649	18598	18598	Lawless	132	" I have eaten many of these dinners beforehand ; but the cooking of them is hot work , good Master Ellis . And meanwhile what do we ? We make black arrows , we write rhymes , and we drink fair cold water , that discomfortable drink . "
18650	18672	18674	18674	Ellis	135	" Y are untrue , Will Lawless . Ye still smell of the Grey Friars buttery ; greed is your undoing , "
18676	18704	18674	18674	Ellis	135	" We took twenty pounds from Appleyard . We took seven marks from the messenger last night . A day ago we had fifty from the merchant . "
18705	18711	18713	18716	one of the men	693	" And to - day , "
18718	18734	18713	18716	one of the men	693	" I stopped a fat pardoner riding apace for Holywood . Here is his purse . "
18740	18745	18746	18746	he	135	" Five score shillings ! "
18749	18780	18746	18746	he	135	" Fool , he had more in his sandal , or stitched into his tippet . Y are but a child , Tom Cuckow ; ye have lost the fish . "
18912	18947	18893	18906	one , whose humour was particularly gay , holding forth an ale - horn	698	" Here is no law in good green shaw , Here is no lack of meat ; Tis merry and quiet , with deer for our diet , In summer , when all is sweet .
18984	18984	19020	19020	he	129	"
19235	19238	19239	19239	he	135	" Lads , "
19242	19288	19239	19239	he	135	" ye know your places . Let not one man s soul escape you . Appleyard was a whet before a meal ; but now we go to table . I have three men whom I will bitterly avenge Harry Shelton , Simon Malmesbury , and "
19293	19302	19239	19239	he	135	" and Ellis Duckworth , by the mass ! "
19315	19321	19322	19322	he	675	" Tis not Sir Daniel ! "
19325	19336	19322	19322	he	675	" They are but seven . Is the arrow gone ? "
19337	19343	19345	19345	Ellis	100	" It struck but now , "
19347	19351	19353	19354	the messenger	484	" A murrain ! "
19356	19368	19353	19354	the messenger	484	" Methought I heard it whistle . And I go dinnerless ! "
19445	19450	19451	19452	The lads	649	" BLOODY AS THE HUNTER "
19518	19522	19524	19524	Matcham	128	" And now , "
19526	19531	19524	19524	Matcham	128	" forth to Holywood . "
19532	19536	19538	19538	Dick	76	" To Holywood ! "
19540	19559	19538	19538	Dick	76	" when good fellows stand shot ? Not I ! I would see you hanged first , Jack ! "
19560	19569	19570	19570	Matcham	128	" Ye would leave me , would ye ? "
19573	19580	19582	19582	Dick	76	" Ay , by my sooth ! "
19584	19628	19582	19582	Dick	76	" An I be not in time to warn these lads , I will go die with them . What ! would ye have me leave my own men that I have lived among . I trow not ! Give me my windac . "
19639	19642	19643	19643	he	76	" Dick , "
19646	19673	19643	19643	he	76	" ye sware before the saints that ye would see me safe to Holywood . Would ye be forsworn ? Would you desert me a perjurer ? "
19674	19683	19685	19685	Dick	76	" Nay , I sware for the best , "
19687	19743	19685	19685	Dick	76	" I meant it too ; but now ! But look ye , Jack , turn again with me . Let me but warn these men , and , if needs must , stand shot with them ; then shall all be clear , and I will on again to Holywood and purge mine oath . "
19744	19750	19752	19752	Matcham	128	" Ye but deride me , "
19754	19772	19752	19752	Matcham	128	" These men ye go to succour are the I same that hunt me to my ruin . "
19778	19787	19788	19788	he	76	" I can not help it , Jack , "
19791	19820	19821	19821	he	76	" Here is no remedy . What would ye ? Ye run no great peril , man ; and these are in the way of death . Death ! "
19824	19852	19821	19821	he	76	" Think of it ! What a murrain do ye keep me here for ? Give me the windac . Saint George ! shall they all die ? "
19853	19857	19859	19859	Matcham	128	" Richard Shelton , "
19868	19933	19859	19859	Matcham	128	" would ye , then , join party with Sir Daniel ? Have ye not ears ? Heard ye not this Ellis , what he said ? or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the father that men slew ? Harry Shelton , he said ; and Sir Harry Shelton was your father , as the sun shines in heaven . "
19934	19939	19940	19940	Dick	76	" What would ye ? "
19944	19952	19940	19940	Dick	76	" Would ye have me credit thieves ? "
19953	19963	19965	19965	Matcham	128	" Nay , I have heard it before now , "
19967	20020	19965	19965	Matcham	128	" The fame goeth currently , it was Sir Daniel slew him . He slew him under oath ; in his own house he shed the innocent blood . Heaven wearies for the avenging on t ; and you the man s son ye go about to comfort and defend the murderer ! "
20021	20024	20026	20027	the lad	309	" Jack , "
20028	20111	19965	19965	Matcham	128	" I know not . It may be ; what know I ? But , see here : This man hath bred me up and fostered me , and his men I have hunted with and played among ; and to leave them in the hour of peril O , man , if I did that , I were stark dead to honour ! Nay , Jack , ye would not ask it ; ye would not wish me to be base . "
20112	20119	20121	20121	Matcham	128	" But your father , Dick ? "
20126	20143	20121	20121	Matcham	128	" Your father ? and your oath to me ? Ye took the saints to witness . "
20144	20148	20150	20150	Shelton	76	" My father ? "
20152	20228	20150	20150	Shelton	76	" Nay , he would have me go ! If Sir Daniel slew him , when the hour comes this hand shall slay Sir Daniel ; but neither him nor his will I desert in peril . And for mine oath , good Jack , ye shall absolve me of it here . For the lives sake of many men that hurt you not , and for mine honour , ye shall set me free . "
20229	20236	20238	20238	Matcham	128	" I , Dick ? Never ! "
20240	20257	20238	20238	Matcham	128	" An ye leave me , y are forsworn , and so I shall declare it . "
20258	20263	20265	20265	Dick	76	" My blood heats , "
20267	20277	20265	20265	Dick	76	" Give me the windac ! Give it me ! "
20278	20283	20285	20285	Matcham	128	" I ll not , "
20287	20296	20285	20285	Matcham	128	" I ll save you in your teeth . "
20297	20300	20302	20302	Dick	76	" Not ? "
20304	20310	20302	20302	Dick	76	" I ll make you ! "
20311	20315	20317	20318	the other	311	" Try it , "
20411	20417	20418	20418	he	76	" I ll teach you ! "
20423	20436	20418	20418	he	76	" Oath or no oath , ye may go hang for me ! "
20459	20465	20467	20467	Dick	76	" What d ye want ? "
20471	20481	20467	20467	Dick	76	" What make ye after me ? Stand off ! "
20482	20489	20491	20491	Matcham	128	" Will follow an I please , "
20493	20501	20491	20491	Matcham	128	" This wood is free to me . "
20502	20510	20512	20512	Dick	76	" Stand back , by r Lady ! "
20518	20527	20529	20529	Matcham	128	" Ah , y are a brave boy ! "
20531	20534	20529	20529	Matcham	128	" Shoot ! "
20543	20547	20548	20548	he	76	" See here , "
20551	20586	20548	20548	he	76	" Y have done me ill enough . Go , then . Go your way in fair wise ; or , whether I will or not , I must even drive you to it . "
20587	20590	20592	20592	Matcham	128	" Well , "
20596	20621	20622	20622	he	128	" y are the stronger . Do your worst . I shall not leave to follow thee , Dick , unless thou makest me , "
20674	20682	20683	20683	he	76	" Y are mad , I think , "
20686	20710	20683	20683	he	76	" Fool - fellow , I am hasting to your foes ; as fast as foot can carry me , go I thither . "
20711	20718	20720	20721	the lad	309	" I care not , Dick , "
20723	20753	20720	20721	the lad	309	" If y are bound to die , Dick , I ll die too . I would liever go with you to prison than to go free without you . "
20754	20757	20759	20760	the other	311	" Well , "
20762	20805	20759	20760	the other	311	" I may stand no longer prating . Follow me , if ye must ; but if ye play me false , it shall but little advance you , mark ye that . Shalt have a quarrel in thine inwards , boy . "
20878	20885	20886	20886	he	76	" I shall see from there , "
21040	21052	21053	21053	he	76	" So y are to be true to me , Jack ? "
21056	21066	21053	21053	he	76	" I thought ye were of the other party . "
21072	21076	21078	21078	Dick	76	" What cheer ! "
21080	21094	21078	21078	Dick	76	" Now the saints behold us ! would ye snivel for a word ? "
21095	21100	21102	21102	Matcham	128	" Ye hurt me , "
21104	21123	21102	21102	Matcham	128	" Ye hurt me when ye threw me down . Y are a coward to abuse your strength . "
21124	21133	21135	21135	Dick	76	" Nay , that is fool s talk , "
21139	21178	21135	21135	Dick	76	" Y had no title to my windac , Master John . I would a done right to have well basted you . If ye go with me , ye must obey me ; and so , come . "
21440	21445	21446	21446	Dick	76	" Now , mark , "
21449	21553	21446	21446	Dick	76	" They be already well advanced into the wood ; their safety lieth rather in continuing forward . But see ye where this wide glade runneth down before us , and in the midst of it , these two score trees make like an island ? There were their safety . An they but come sound as far as that , I will make shift to warn them . But my heart misgiveth me ; they are but seven against so many , and they but carry cross - bows . The long - bow , Jack , will have the uppermost ever . "
22696	22699	22700	22700	he	76	" Here ! "
22703	22718	22700	22700	he	76	" This way ! here is help ! Nay , run , fellow run ! "
22755	22762	22764	22764	Matcham	128	" O , the poor heart ! "
22840	22843	22891	22894	John Amend - All	95	" Hold ! "
22847	22863	22891	22894	John Amend - All	95	" Shoot not ! Take him alive ! It is young Shelton Harry s son . "
22906	22912	22914	22914	Dick	76	" Ah , foul fortune ! "
22916	22928	22914	22914	Dick	76	" We are undone . Swiftly , Jack , come swiftly ! "
23206	23210	23212	23212	Dick	76	" On again , "
23323	23326	23347	23365	a stout fellow in green , sore blown with running , who instantly drew an arrow to the head	824	" Stand ! "
23508	23511	23513	23513	Dick	76	" On ! "
24089	24092	24093	24093	he	76	" Come , "
24174	24182	24184	24184	Dick	76	" If there were anything to eat ! "
24201	24226	24228	24228	Dick	76	" Ye can weep for your own supper , but when it was to save men s lives , your heart was hard enough , "
24232	24252	24228	24228	Dick	76	" Y ave seven deaths upon your conscience , Master John ; I ll ne er forgive you that . "
24253	24256	24258	24258	Matcham	128	" Conscience ! "
24264	24328	24258	24258	Matcham	128	" Mine ! And ye have the man s red blood upon your dagger ! And wherefore did ye slay him , the poor soul ? He drew his arrow , but he let not fly ; he held you in his hand , and spared you ! Tis as brave to kill a kitten , as a man that not defends himself . "
24334	24348	24349	24349	he	76	" I slew him fair . I ran me in upon his bow , "
24352	24359	24361	24361	Matcham	128	" It was a coward blow , "
24363	24447	24361	24361	Matcham	128	" Y are but a lout and bully , Master Dick ; ye but abuse advantages ; let there come a stronger , we will see you truckle at his boot ! Ye care not for vengeance , neither for your father s death that goes unpaid , and his poor ghost that clamoureth for justice . But if there come but a poor creature in your hands that lacketh skill and strength , and would befriend you , down she shall go ! "
24455	24458	24448	24448	Dick	76	" she . "
24459	24462	24463	24463	he	76	" Marry ! "
24466	24522	24463	24463	he	76	" and here is news ! Of any two the one will still be stronger . The better man throweth the worse , and the worse is well served . Ye deserve a belting , Master Matcham , for your ill - guidance and unthankfulness to meward ; and what ye deserve ye shall have . "
24547	24554	24555	24555	he	76	" Here shall be your supper , "
24621	24631	24632	24632	he	120	" Say ye were in the wrong , then , "
24637	24640	24642	24642	Matcham	120	" Nay , "
24644	24680	24642	24642	Matcham	120	" I was in the right . Come , cruel ! I be lame ; I be weary ; I resist not ; I ne er did thee hurt ; come , beat me coward ! "
24728	24736	24737	24737	he	76	" A plague upon thee , shrew ! "
24740	24769	24771	24771	he	76	" An ye be so feeble of hand , ye should keep the closer guard upon your tongue . But I ll be hanged before I beat you ! "
24778	24785	24786	24786	he	76	" Beat you I will not , "
24789	24937	24786	24786	he	76	" but forgive you ? never . I knew ye not ; ye were my master s enemy ; I lent you my horse ; my dinner ye have eaten ; y ave called me a man o wood , a coward , and a bully . Nay , by the mass ! the measure is filled , and runneth over . Tis a great thing to be weak , I trow : ye can do your worst , yet shall none punish you ; ye may steal a man s weapons in the hour of need , yet may the man not take his own again ; y are weak , forsooth ! Nay , then , if one cometh charging at you with a lance , and crieth he is weak , ye must let him pierce your body through ! Tut ! fool words ! "
24938	24946	24948	24948	Matcham	120	" And yet ye beat me not , "
24950	24954	24956	24956	Dick	76	" Let be , "
24957	25042	24786	24786	he	76	" let be . I will instruct you . Y ave been ill - nurtured , methinks , and yet ye have the makings of some good , and , beyond all question , saved me from the river . Nay , I had forgotten it ; I am as thankless as thyself . But , come , let us on . An we be for Holywood this night , ay , or to - morrow early , we had best set forward speedily . "
25093	25105	25107	25107	Matcham	120	" I will thank you , for the form s sake , "
25109	25154	25107	25107	Matcham	120	" But , in sooth , good Master Shelton , I had liever find my way alone . Here is a wide wood ; prithee , let each choose his path ; I owe you a dinner and a lesson . Fare ye well ! "
25155	25158	25160	25160	Dick	76	" Nay , "
25162	25180	25160	25160	Dick	76	" if that be your tune , so be it , and a plague be with you ! "
25224	25227	25228	25228	he	120	" Dick , "
25231	25282	25228	25228	he	120	" it were unmannerly to part so coldly . Here is my hand , and my heart with it . For all that wherein you have so excellently served and helped me not for the form , but from the heart , I thank you . Fare ye right well . "
25283	25288	25290	25290	Dick	76	" Well , lad , "
25300	25322	25290	25290	Dick	76	" good speed to you , if speed you may . But I misdoubt it shrewdly . Y are too disputatious . "
25343	25346	25347	25347	he	76	" Here , "
25350	25362	25347	25347	he	76	" take my cross - bow ; shalt not go unarmed . "
25363	25369	25371	25371	Matcham	120	" A cross - bow ! "
25373	25410	25371	25371	Matcham	120	" Nay , boy , I have neither the strength to bend nor yet the skill to aim with it . It were no help to me , good boy . But yet I thank you . "
25431	25441	25443	25443	Dick	76	" I will go some little way with you , "
25445	25475	25443	25443	Dick	76	" The night is dark . I would fain leave you on a path , at least . My mind misgiveth me , y are likely to be lost . "
25603	25608	25609	25609	Dick	76	" Y are weary ? "
25612	25620	25622	25622	Matcham	120	" Nay , I am so weary , "
25624	25634	25622	25622	Matcham	120	" that methinks I could lie down and die . "
25635	25644	25646	25646	Dick	76	" I hear the chiding of a river , "
25648	25662	25646	25646	Dick	76	" Let us go so far forth , for I am sore athirst . "
25716	25719	25721	25721	Matcham	120	" Dick , "
25723	25734	25721	25721	Matcham	120	" it may not be . I can no more . "
25735	25745	25747	25747	Dick	76	" I saw a pit as we came down , "
25749	25758	25747	25747	Dick	76	" Let us lie down therein and sleep . "
25759	25768	25770	25770	Matcham	120	" Nay , but with all my heart ! "
25923	25927	25929	25929	Dick	76	" A bell ! "
25934	25946	25929	25929	Dick	76	" Can we be , then , so near to Holywood ? "
25989	25997	25999	25999	Dick	76	" Nay , what should this betoken ? "
26007	26014	26016	26016	Matcham	120	" It is some one walking , "
26019	26028	26016	26016	Matcham	120	" the bell tolleth ever as he moves . "
26029	26035	26037	26037	Dick	76	" I see that well , "
26039	26052	26053	26053	he	76	" But wherefore ? What maketh he in Tunstall Woods ? Jack , "
26056	26074	26053	26053	he	76	" laugh at me an ye will , but I like not the hollow sound of it . "
26075	26078	26080	26080	Matcham	120	" Nay , "
26086	26099	26080	26080	Matcham	120	" it hath a doleful note . An the day were not come "
26133	26155	26156	26156	Dick	76	" It is as though the bearer had run for a pater - noster while , and then leaped the river , "
26159	26170	26172	26172	Matcham	120	" And now beginneth he again to pace soberly forward , "
26174	26177	26179	26179	Dick	76	" Nay , "
26180	26224	26172	26172	Matcham	120	" nay , not so soberly , Jack . Tis a man that walketh you right speedily . Tis a man in some fear of his life , or about some hurried business . See ye not how swift the beating draweth near ? "
26225	26232	26234	26234	Matcham	120	" It is now close by , "
26455	26459	26461	26461	Dick	76	" A leper ! "
26465	26471	26473	26473	Matcham	120	" His touch is death , "
26475	26480	26473	26473	Matcham	120	" Let us run . "
26481	26485	26487	26487	Dick	76	" Not so , "
26489	26540	26487	26487	Dick	76	" See ye not ? he is stone blind . He guideth him with a staff . Let us lie still ; the wind bloweth towards the path , and he will go by and hurt us not . Alas , poor soul , and we should rather pity him ! "
26541	26551	26553	26553	Matcham	120	" I will pity him when he is by , "
26698	26708	26710	26710	Matcham	120	" Mary be my shield ! He sees us ! "
26714	26717	26719	26719	Dick	76	" Hush ! "
26721	26733	26719	26719	Dick	76	" He doth but hearken . He is blind , fool ! "
26830	26835	26837	26837	Matcham	120	" He saw us , "
26839	26845	26837	26837	Matcham	120	" I could swear it ! "
26846	26849	26851	26851	Dick	76	" Tut ! "
26859	26901	26851	26851	Dick	76	" He but heard us . He was in fear , poor soul ! An ye were blind , and walked in a perpetual night , ye would start yourself , if ever a twig rustled or a bird cried Peep . "
26902	26912	26914	26914	Matcham	120	" Dick , good Dick , he saw us , "
26916	26959	26914	26914	Matcham	120	" When a man hearkeneth , he doth not as this man ; he doth otherwise , Dick . This was seeing ; it was not hearing . He means foully . Hark , else , if his bell be not stopped ! "
26971	26974	26976	26976	Dick	76	" Nay , "
26978	26986	26987	26987	he	76	" I like not that . Nay , "
26991	27010	26987	26987	he	76	" I like that little . What may this betoken ? Let us go , by the mass ! "
27011	27017	27019	27019	Matcham	120	" He hath gone east , "
27021	27045	27019	27019	Matcham	120	" Good Dick , let us go westward straight ; I shall not breathe till I have my back turned upon that leper . "
27046	27054	27056	27056	Dick	76	" Jack , y are too cowardly , "
27058	27086	27056	27056	Dick	76	" We shall go fair for Holywood , or as fair , at least , as I can guide you , and that will be due north . "
27283	27290	27292	27292	Dick	76	" Certain , he pursueth us , "
27293	27334	27292	27292	Dick	76	" certain ! He held the clapper of his bell in one hand , saw ye ? that it should not sound . Now may the saints aid and guide us , for I have no strength to combat pestilence ! "
27335	27340	27342	27342	Matcham	120	" What maketh he ? "
27344	27394	27342	27342	Matcham	120	" What doth he want ? Who ever heard the like , that a leper , out of mere malice , should pursue unfortunates ? Hath he not his bell to that very end , that people may avoid him ? Dick , there is below this something deeper . "
27395	27402	27404	27404	Dick	76	" Nay , I care not , "
27406	27427	27404	27404	Dick	76	" the strength is gone out of me ; my legs are like water . The saints be mine assistance ! "
27428	27435	27437	27437	Matcham	120	" Would ye lie there idle ? "
27439	27461	27437	27437	Matcham	120	" Let us back into the open . We have the better chance ; he can not steal upon us unawares . "
27462	27466	27468	27468	Dick	76	" Not I , "
27470	27484	27468	27468	Dick	76	" My time is come , and peradventure he may pass us by . "
27485	27494	27496	27497	the other	311	" Bend me , then , your bow ! "
27499	27508	27496	27497	the other	311	" What ! will ye be a man ? "
27513	27523	27524	27524	he	76	" Would ye have me shoot upon a leper ? "
27527	27538	27539	27539	he	76	" The hand would fail me . Nay , now , "
27541	27580	27539	27539	he	76	" nay , now , let be ! With sound men I will fight , but not with ghosts and lepers . Which this is , I wot not . One or other , Heaven be our protection ! "
27581	27584	27586	27586	Matcham	120	" Now , "
27588	27615	27586	27586	Matcham	120	" if this be man s courage , what a poor thing is man ! But sith ye will do naught , let us lie close . "
27627	27637	27639	27639	Matcham	120	" He hath missed his hold upon the clapper , "
27641	27649	27639	27639	Matcham	120	" Saints ! how near he is ! "
27879	27886	27916	27916	he	120	" Hold your shot , Dickon ! "
27892	27906	27916	27916	he	120	" Hold your shot , mad wag ! Know ye not a friend ? "
27934	27938	27940	27940	Dick	76	" Sir Daniel ! "
27942	27952	27954	27955	the knight	438	" Ay , by the mass , Sir Daniel ! "
27957	27971	27974	27974	he	120	" Would ye shoot upon your guardian , rogue ? But here is this "
27985	27993	27974	27974	he	120	" How call ye him , Dick ? "
27994	27997	27999	27999	Dick	76	" Nay , "
28001	28019	27999	27999	Dick	76	" I call him Master Matcham . Know ye him not ? He said ye knew him ! "
28020	28023	28025	28026	Sir Daniel	72	" Ay , "
28028	28034	28036	28036	he	72	" I know the lad ; "
28039	28074	28036	28036	he	72	" But he has fainted ; and , by my sooth , he might have had less to faint for ! Hey , Dick ? Did I put the fear of death upon you ? "
28075	28085	28087	28087	Dick	76	" Indeed , Sir Daniel , ye did that , "
28097	28142	28087	28087	Dick	76	" Nay , sir , saving your respect , I had as lief a met the devil in person ; and to speak truth , I am yet all a - quake . But what made ye , sir , in such a guise ? "
28153	28158	28159	28159	he	72	" What made I ? "
28162	28396	28397	28397	he	921	" Ye do well to mind me of it ! What ? I skulked for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall , Dick . We were ill sped at the battle ; we but got there to be swept among the rout . Where be all my good men - at - arms ? Dick , by the mass , I know not ! We were swept down ; the shot fell thick among us ; I have not seen one man in my own colours since I saw three fall . For myself , I came sound to Shoreby , and being mindful of the Black Arrow , got me this gown and bell , and came softly by the path for the Moat House . There is no disguise to be compared with it ; the jingle of this bell would scare me the stoutest outlaw in the forest ; they would all turn pale to hear it . At length I came by you and Matcham . I could see but evilly through this same hood , and was not sure of you , being chiefly , and for many a good cause , astonished at the finding you together . Moreover , in the open , where I had to go slowly and tap with my staff , I feared to disclose myself . But see , "
28400	28422	28397	28397	he	921	" this poor shrew begins a little to revive . A little good canary will comfort me the heart of it . "
28468	28474	28476	28476	Dick	76	" What cheer , Jack ! "
28478	28494	28476	28476	Dick	76	" It was no leper , after all ; it was Sir Daniel ! See ! "
28495	28504	28506	28507	the knight	438	" Swallow me a good draught of this , "
28509	28539	28540	28540	he	921	" This will give you manhood . Thereafter , I will give you both a meal , and we shall all three on to Tunstall . For , Dick , "
28552	28686	28540	28540	he	921	" I will avow to you , in all good conscience , it irks me sorely to be safe between four walls . Not since I backed a horse have I been pressed so hard ; peril of life , jeopardy of land and livelihood , and to sum up , all these losels in the wood to hunt me down . But I be not yet shent . Some of my lads will pick me their way home . Hatch hath ten fellows ; Selden , he had six . Nay , we shall soon be strong again ; and if I can but buy my peace with my right fortunate and undeserving Lord of York , why , Dick , we ll be a man again and go a - horseback ! "
28708	28711	28712	28712	Dick	76	" Selden , "
28714	28716	28718	28718	he	76	" Selden "
28730	28733	28734	28734	he	72	" How ! "
28742	28751	28734	28734	he	72	" Selden ? Speak ! What of Selden ? "
28784	28788	28789	28789	he	438	" Now here , "
28792	28883	28789	28789	he	438	" on my right hand , I swear to avenge it ! If that I fail , if that I spill not ten men s souls for each , may this hand wither from my body ! I broke this Duckworth like a rush ; I beggared him to his door ; I burned the thatch above his head ; I drove him from this country ; and now , cometh he back to beard me ? Nay , but , Duckworth , this time it shall go bitter hard ! "
28895	28898	28899	28899	he	438	" Eat ! "
28904	28909	28910	28910	he	438	" And you here , "
28915	28928	28910	28910	he	438	" swear me an oath to follow straight to the Moat House . "
28929	28936	28938	28938	Matcham	128	" I will pledge mine honour , "
28940	28948	28950	28951	the knight	438	" What make I with your honour ? "
28953	28962	28950	28951	the knight	438	" Swear me upon your mother s welfare ! "
29015	29020	29021	29021	he	438	" Eat with despatch , "
29024	29033	29021	29021	he	438	" and follow me yarely to mine house . "
29080	29088	29089	29089	Dick	76	" And so ye go to Tunstall ? "
29092	29097	29099	29099	Matcham	128	" Yea , verily , "
29101	29119	29099	29099	Matcham	128	" when needs must ! I am braver behind Sir Daniel s back than to his face . "
29193	29196	29198	29198	Matcham	128	" Here , "
29202	29245	29198	29198	Matcham	128	" ye shall take your leave of your friend Jack , whom y are to see no more . Come , Dick , forgive him what he did amiss , as he , for his part , cheerfully and lovingly forgiveth you . "
29246	29251	29253	29253	Dick	76	" And wherefore so ? "
29255	29278	29253	29253	Dick	76	" An we both go to Tunstall , I shall see you yet again , I trow , and that right often . "
29279	29289	29291	29292	the other	311	" Ye ll never again see poor Jack Matcham , "
29294	29323	29324	29324	He	311	" that was so fearful and burthensome , and yet plucked you from the river ; ye ll not see him more , Dick , by mine honour ! "
29337	29342	29344	29344	Matcham	128	" And , Dick , "
29346	29458	29344	29344	Matcham	128	" my spirit bodeth ill . Y are now to see a new Sir Daniel ; for heretofore hath all prospered in his hands exceedingly , and fortune followed him ; but now , methinks , when his fate hath come upon him , and he runs the adventure of his life , he will prove but a foul lord to both of us . He may be brave in battle , but he hath the liar s eye ; there is fear in his eye , Dick , and fear is as cruel as the wolf ! We go down into that house , Saint Mary guide us forth again ! "
29877	29881	29883	29883	people	249	" The world , "
29889	29893	29883	29883	people	249	" might change again "
30251	30257	30259	30259	Hatch	77	" Nay , Master Shelton , "
30263	30354	30259	30259	Hatch	77	" nay , but what said I ? We shall all go . Selden was a man of his hands ; he was like a brother to me . Well , he has gone second ; well , we shall all follow ! For what said their knave rhyme ? A black arrow in each black heart . Was it not so it went ? Appleyard , Selden , Smith , old Humphrey gone ; and there lieth poor John Carter , crying , poor sinner , for the priest . "
30380	30385	30386	30386	he	76	" Lieth he there ? "
30389	30399	30401	30401	Hatch	77	" Ay , in the second porter s chamber , "
30403	30481	30401	30401	Hatch	77	" We could not bear him further , soul and body were so bitterly at odds . At every step we lifted him , he thought to wend . But now , methinks , it is the soul that suffereth . Ever for the priest he crieth , and Sir Oliver , I wot not why , still cometh not . Twill be a long shrift ; but poor Appleyard and poor Selden , they had none . "
30513	30523	30524	30524	he	76	" Carter , poor friend , how goeth it ? "
30527	30531	30533	30534	the man	3175	" Master Shelton , "
30541	30619	30533	30534	the man	3175	" for the dear light of heaven , bring the priest . Alack , I am sped ; I am brought very low down ; my hurt is to the death . Ye may do me no more service ; this shall be the last . Now , for my poor soul s interest , and as a loyal gentleman , bestir you ; for I have that matter on my conscience that shall drag me deep . "
30658	30661	30662	30662	he	72	" Lads , "
30665	30885	30662	30662	he	72	" we have had a shog , we have had a tumble ; wherefore , then , deny it ? Rather it imputeth to get speedily again to saddle . This old Harry the Sixt has had the undermost . Wash we , then , our hands of him . I have a good friend that rideth next the duke , the Lord of Wensleydale . Well , I have writ a letter to my friend , praying his good lordship , and offering large satisfaction for the past and reasonable surety for the future . Doubt not but he will lend a favourable ear . A prayer without gifts is like a song without music : I surfeit him with promises , boys I spare not to promise . What , then , is lacking ? Nay , a great thing wherefore should I deceive you ? a great thing and a difficult : a messenger to bear it . The woods y are not ignorant of that lie thick with our ill - willers . Haste is most needful ; but without sleight and caution all is naught . Which , then , of this company will take me this letter , bear me it to my Lord of Wensleydale , and bring me the answer back ? "
30891	30900	30902	30902	he	990	" I will , an t like you , "
30904	30912	30902	30902	he	990	" I will even risk my carcase . "
30913	30922	30924	30925	the knight	438	" Nay , Dicky Bowyer , not so , "
30927	30948	30924	30925	the knight	438	" It likes me not . Y are sly indeed , but not speedy . Ye were a laggard ever . "
30949	30962	30964	30964	another	992	" An t be so , Sir Daniel , here am I , "
30966	30971	30973	30974	the knight	438	" The saints forfend ! "
30976	31017	30973	30974	the knight	438	" Y are speedy , but not sly . Ye would blunder me headforemost into John Amend - All s camp . I thank you both for your good courage ; but , in sooth , it may not be . "
31029	31046	31048	31049	the knight	438	" I want you here , good Bennet ; y are my right hand , indeed , "
31072	31075	31076	31076	he	72	" Now , "
31079	31164	31076	31076	he	72	" upon your good speed and better discretion we do all depend . Bring me a good answer back , and before three weeks , I will have purged my forest of these vagabonds that brave us to our faces . But mark it well , Throgmorton : the matter is not easy . Ye must steal forth under night , and go like a fox ; and how ye are to cross Till I know not , neither by the bridge nor ferry . "
31165	31170	31172	31172	Throgmorton	148	" I can swim , "
31174	31183	31172	31172	Throgmorton	148	" I will come soundly , fear not . "
31184	31195	31197	31198	Sir Daniel	72	" Well , friend , get ye to the buttery , "
31200	31213	31197	31198	Sir Daniel	72	" Ye shall swim first of all in nut - brown ale . "
31224	31232	31234	31234	Hatch	77	" Sir Daniel hath a wise tongue , "
31241	31316	31234	31234	Hatch	77	" See , now , where many a lesser man had glossed the matter over , he speaketh it out plainly to his company . Here is a danger , a saith , and here difficulty ; and jesteth in the very saying . Nay , by Saint Barbary , he is a born captain ! Not a man but he is some deal heartened up ! See how they fall again to work . "
31331	31334	31335	31335	he	309	" Bennet , "
31338	31347	31335	31335	he	309	" how came my father by his end ? "
31348	31354	31356	31356	Hatch	77	" Ask me not that , "
31358	31422	31356	31356	Hatch	77	" I had no hand nor knowledge in it ; furthermore , I will even be silent , Master Dick . For look you , in a man s own business there he may speak ; but of hearsay matters and of common talk , not so . Ask me Sir Oliver ay , or Carter , if ye will ; not me . "
31438	31446	31448	31449	the lad	309	" Wherefore would he not tell me ? "
31451	31471	31448	31449	the lad	309	" And wherefore named he Carter ? Carter nay , then Carter had a hand in it , perchance . "
31510	31517	31518	31518	he	146	" Have ye brought the priest ? "
31521	31526	31528	31528	Dick	76	" Not yet awhile , "
31530	31552	31528	31528	Dick	76	" Y ave a word to tell me first . How came my father , Harry Shelton , by his death ? "
31560	31565	31566	31566	he	3175	" I know not , "
31571	31578	31580	31580	Dick	76	" Nay , ye know well , "
31582	31590	31580	31580	Dick	76	" Seek not to put me by . "
31591	31599	31601	31601	Carter	146	" I tell you I know not , "
31603	31606	31608	31608	Dick	76	" Then , "
31610	31667	31608	31608	Dick	76	" ye shall die unshriven . Here am I , and here shall stay . There shall no priest come near you , rest assured . For of what avail is penitence , an ye have no mind to right those wrongs ye had a hand in ? and without penitence , confession is but mockery . "
31668	31679	31681	31681	Carter	146	" Ye say what ye mean not , Master Dick , "
31685	31740	31681	31681	Carter	146	" It is ill threatening the dying , and becometh you to speak truth little . And for as little as it commends you , it shall serve you less . Stay , an ye please . Ye will condemn my soul ye shall learn nothing ! There is my last word to you . "
31777	31780	31781	31781	he	76	" Carter , "
31784	31872	31781	31781	he	76	" mistake me not . I know ye were but an instrument in the hands of others ; a churl must obey his lord ; I would not bear heavily on such an one . But I begin to learn upon many sides that this great duty lieth on my youth and ignorance , to avenge my father . Prithee , then , good Carter , set aside the memory of my threatenings , and in pure goodwill and honest penitence give me a word of help . "
31894	31897	31899	31899	Dick	76	" Well , "
31901	31945	31899	31899	Dick	76	" I will go call the priest to you as ye desired ; for howsoever ye be in fault to me or mine , I would not be willingly in fault to any , least of all to one upon the last change . "
31983	31987	31988	31988	he	76	" And yet , "
31991	32045	31988	31988	he	76	" of what use is courage without wit ? Had his hands been clean , he would have spoken ; his silence did confess the secret louder than words . Nay , upon all sides , proof floweth on me . Sir Daniel , he or his men , hath done this thing . "
32133	32140	32141	32141	he	76	" Pray Heaven he be innocent ! "
32161	32167	32169	32169	Dick	76	" One seeketh you earnestly , "
32171	32181	32183	32184	the priest	338	" I am upon the way , good Richard , "
32186	32200	32183	32184	the priest	338	" It is this poor Carter . Alack , he is beyond cure . "
32201	32212	32214	32214	Dick	76	" And yet his soul is sicker than his body , "
32216	32222	32224	32225	Sir Oliver	73	" Have ye seen him ? "
32232	32240	32242	32242	Dick	76	" I do but come from him , "
32244	32253	32255	32256	the priest	338	" What said he ? what said he ? "
32262	32290	32292	32293	the lad	309	" He but cried for you the more piteously , Sir Oliver . It were well done to go the faster , for his hurt is grievous , "
32295	32302	32348	32349	The priest	338	" I am straight for him , "
32307	32328	32348	32349	The priest	338	" Well , we have all our sins . We must all come to our latter day , good Richard . "
32329	32344	32346	32346	Dick	76	" Ay , sir ; and it were well if we all came fairly , "
32362	32367	32369	32369	Dick	76	" He , too ! "
32370	32425	32369	32369	Dick	76	" he , that taught me in piety ! Nay , then , what a world is this , if all that care for me be blood - guilty of my father s death ? Vengeance ! Alas ! what a sore fate is mine , if I must be avenged upon my friends ! "
32650	32653	32654	32654	he	76	" Goody , "
32657	32677	32654	32654	he	76	" where is Master Matcham , I prithee ? I saw ye go in with him when we arrived . "
32684	32690	32691	32691	she	1031	" Ah , Master Dick , "
32694	32709	32691	32691	she	1031	" y have a famous bright eye in your head , to be sure ! "
32714	32724	32726	32726	Dick	76	" Nay , but where is he , indeed ? "
32728	32736	32737	32737	she	1031	" Ye will never see him more , "
32739	32746	32678	32680	The old woman	1031	" never . It is sure . "
32747	32753	32755	32756	the lad	309	" An I do not , "
32758	32810	32755	32756	the lad	309	" I will know the reason why . He came not hither of his full free will ; such as I am , I am his best protector , and I will see him justly used . There be too many mysteries ; I do begin to weary of the game ! "
32849	32853	32854	32854	he	76	" Friend Dick , "
32864	32956	32854	32854	he	76	" are ye a moon - struck natural ? An ye leave not certain things in peace , ye were better in the salt sea than here in Tunstall Moat House . Y have questioned me ; y have baited Carter ; y have frighted the Jack - priest with hints . Bear ye more wisely , fool ; and even now , when Sir Daniel calleth you , show me a smooth face for the love of wisdom . Y are to be sharply questioned . Look to your answers . "
32957	32960	32962	32962	Dick	76	" Hatch , "
32964	32974	32962	32962	Dick	76	" in all this I smell a guilty conscience . "
32975	32989	32991	32991	Bennet	77	" An ye go not the wiser , ye will soon smell blood , "
32993	33008	32991	32991	Bennet	77	" I do but warn you . And here cometh one to call you . "
33078	33088	33090	33091	young Shelton	74	" Y have sent for me , Sir Daniel ? "
33093	33102	33104	33105	the knight	438	" I have sent for you , indeed , "
33107	33207	33104	33105	the knight	438	" For what cometh to mine ears ? Have I been to you so heavy a guardian that ye make haste to credit ill of me ? Or sith that ye see me , for the nonce , some worsted , do ye think to quit my party ? By the mass , your father was not so ! Those he was near , those he stood by , come wind or weather . But you , Dick , y are a fair - day friend , it seemeth , and now seek to clear yourself of your allegiance . "
33208	33220	33222	33222	Dick	76	" An t please you , Sir Daniel , not so , "
33226	33277	33222	33222	Dick	76	" I am grateful and faithful , where gratitude and faith are due . And before more is said , I thank you , and I thank Sir Oliver ; y have great claims upon me both none can have more ; I were a hound if I forgot them . "
33278	33283	33285	33286	Sir Daniel	72	" It is well , "
33295	33305	33306	33306	he	72	" Gratitude and faith are words , Dick Shelton , "
33309	33420	33306	33306	he	72	" but I look to deeds . In this hour of my peril , when my name is attainted , when my lands are forfeit , when this wood is full of men that hunger and thirst for my destruction , what doth gratitude ? what doth faith ? I have but a little company remaining ; is it grateful or faithful to poison me their hearts with your insidious whisperings ? Save me from such gratitude ! But , come , now , what is it ye wish ? Speak ; we are here to answer . If ye have aught against me , stand forth and say it . "
33421	33424	33426	33426	Dick	76	" Sir , "
33428	33504	33426	33426	Dick	76	" my father fell when I was yet a child . It hath come to mine ears that he was foully done by . It hath come to mine ears for I will not dissemble that ye had a hand in his undoing . And in all verity , I shall not be at peace in mine own mind , nor very clear to help you , till I have certain resolution of these doubts . "
33527	33545	33546	33546	he	72	" And ye think I would be guardian to the man s son that I had murdered ? "
33549	33552	33554	33554	Dick	76	" Nay , "
33556	33643	33554	33554	Dick	76	" pardon me if I answer churlishly ; but indeed ye know right well a wardship is most profitable . All these years have ye not enjoyed my revenues , and led my men ? Have ye not still my marriage ? I wot not what it may be worth it is worth something . Pardon me again ; but if ye were base enough to slay a man under trust , here were , perhaps , reasons enough to move you to the lesser baseness . "
33644	33653	33655	33656	Sir Daniel	72	" When I was lad of your years , "
33660	33675	33676	33676	he	76	" my mind had not so turned upon suspicions . And Sir Oliver here , "
33679	33693	33676	33676	he	76	" why should he , a priest , be guilty of this act ? "
33694	33700	33702	33702	Dick	76	" Nay , Sir Daniel , "
33704	33785	33702	33702	Dick	76	" but where the master biddeth there will the dog go . It is well known this priest is but your instrument . I speak very freely ; the time is not for courtesies . Even as I speak , so would I be answered . And answer get I none ! Ye but put more questions . I rede ye be ware , Sir Daniel ; for in this way ye will but nourish and not satisfy my doubts . "
33786	33796	33798	33799	the knight	438	" I will answer you fairly , Master Richard , "
33801	33932	33798	33799	the knight	438	" Were I to pretend ye have not stirred my wrath , I were no honest man . But I will be just even in anger . Come to me with these words when y are grown and come to man s estate , and I am no longer your guardian , and so helpless to resent them . Come to me then , and I will answer you as ye merit , with a buffet in the mouth . Till then ye have two courses : either swallow me down these insults , keep a silent tongue , and fight in the meanwhile for the man that fed and fought for your infancy ; or else the door standeth open , the woods are full of mine enemies go . "
33967	33982	33983	33983	he	76	" I desire nothing more earnestly , Sir Daniel , than to believe you , "
33986	33995	33983	33983	he	76	" Assure me ye are free from this . "
33996	34007	34009	34010	the knight	438	" Will ye take my word of honour , Dick ? "
34012	34017	34019	34020	the lad	309	" That would I , "
34022	34028	34030	34031	Sir Daniel	72	" I give it you , "
34033	34070	34030	34031	Sir Daniel	72	" Upon my word of honour , upon the eternal welfare of my spirit , and as I shall answer for my deeds hereafter , I had no hand nor portion in your father s death . "
34115	34118	34120	34120	Dick	76	" Ah , "
34122	34162	34120	34120	Dick	76	" ye must find it in your great - heartedness to pardon me ! I was a churl , indeed , to doubt of you . But ye have my hand upon it ; I will doubt no more . "
34163	34168	34170	34171	Sir Daniel	72	" Nay , Dick , "
34173	34188	34170	34171	Sir Daniel	72	" y are forgiven . Ye know not the world and its calumnious nature . "
34189	34197	34199	34199	Dick	76	" I was the more to blame , "
34201	34218	34199	34199	Dick	76	" in that the rogues pointed , not directly at yourself , but at Sir Oliver . "
34332	34335	34336	34336	he	72	" Nay , "
34339	34351	34336	34336	he	72	" Sir Oliver may swear also . Twas him they accused . "
34352	34357	34359	34360	the knight	438	" He shall swear , "
34369	34381	34383	34384	Sir Daniel	72	" Ay , by the mass ! but ye shall swear , "
34391	34402	34403	34403	he	72	" Here , upon this book , ye shall swear , "
34418	34434	34403	34403	he	72	" What ! Ye make me doubt you ! Swear , I say ; swear ! "
34577	34583	34585	34586	the knight	438	" Whence came that shot ? "
34588	34596	34598	34599	a sentinel	1061	" From yonder clump , Sir Daniel , "
34615	34618	34619	34619	he	438	" Dick , "
34622	34680	34619	34619	he	438	" keep me an eye upon these men ; I leave you in charge here . As for the priest , he shall clear himself , or I will know the reason why . I do almost begin to share in your suspicions . He shall swear , trust me , or we shall prove him guilty . "
34749	34752	34789	34790	Sir Oliver	73	" Earthed . "
34753	34756	34757	34757	he	438	" Ay , "
34761	34788	34757	34757	he	438	" they know I am home , then . Earthed ! Ay , but there is not a dog among them fit to dig me out . "
34803	34809	34810	34810	he	73	" Alack , Sir Daniel ! "
34813	34830	34810	34810	he	73	" y ave sworn a dread oath ; y are doomed to the end of time . "
34831	34834	34836	34837	the knight	438	" Ay , "
34839	34885	34836	34837	the knight	438	" I have sworn an oath , indeed , thou chucklehead ; but thyself shalt swear a greater . It shall be on the blessed cross of Holywood . Look to it ; get the words ready . It shall be sworn to - night . "
34886	34894	34896	34897	the priest	338	" Now , may Heaven lighten you ! "
34899	34909	34896	34897	the priest	338	" may Heaven incline your heart from this iniquity ! "
34910	34918	34920	34921	Sir Daniel	72	" Look you , my good father , "
34923	35092	34920	34921	Sir Daniel	72	" if y are for piety , I say no more ; ye begin late , that is all . But if y are in any sense bent upon wisdom , hear me . This lad beginneth to irk me like a wasp . I have a need for him , for I would sell his marriage . But I tell you , in all plainness , if that he continue to weary me , he shall go join his father . I give orders now to change him to the chamber above the chapel . If that ye can swear your innocency with a good , solid oath and an assured countenance , it is well ; the lad will be at peace a little , and I will spare him . If that ye stammer or blench , or anyways boggle at the swearing , he will not believe you ; and by the mass , he shall die . There is for your thinking on . "
35093	35100	35102	35103	the priest	338	" The chamber above the chapel ! "
35105	35109	35111	35112	the knight	438	" That same , "
35114	35176	35111	35112	the knight	438	" So if ye desire to save him , save him ; and if ye desire not , prithee , go to , and let me be at peace ! For an I had been a hasty man , I would already have put my sword through you , for your intolerable cowardice and folly . Have ye chosen ? Say ! "
35177	35182	35184	35185	the priest	338	" I have chosen , "
35187	35208	35184	35185	the priest	338	" Heaven pardon me , I will do evil for good . I will swear for the lad s sake . "
35209	35215	35217	35218	Sir Daniel	72	" So is it best ! "
35220	35253	35217	35218	Sir Daniel	72	" Send for him , then , speedily . Ye shall see him alone . Yet I shall have an eye on you . I shall be here in the panel room . "
35313	35324	35325	35326	the priest	338	" Nay , if he is in the chapel room , "
35329	35343	35325	35326	the priest	338	" were it at my soul s cost , I must save him . "
35371	35375	35376	35376	he	76	" Richard Shelton , "
35379	35432	35376	35376	he	76	" ye have required an oath from me . I might complain , I might deny you ; but my heart is moved toward you for the past , and I will even content you as ye choose . By the true cross of Holywood , I did not slay your father . "
35433	35437	35439	35439	Dick	76	" Sir Oliver , "
35441	35484	35439	35439	Dick	76	" when first we read John Amend - All s paper , I was convinced of so much . But suffer me to put two questions . Ye did not slay him ; granted . But had ye no hand in it ? "
35485	35488	35490	35491	Sir Oliver	73	" None , "
35548	35553	35554	35554	he	76	" What make ye ? "
35557	35562	35564	35565	the priest	338	" Why , naught , "
35572	35621	35564	35565	the priest	338	" I make naught ; I do but suffer ; I am sick . I I prithee , Dick , I must begone . On the true cross of Holywood , I am clean innocent alike of violence or treachery . Content ye , good lad . Farewell ! "
35968	35981	35982	35982	he	76	" If I can not get me forth out of this house , "
35985	36010	35982	35982	he	76	" I am a dead man ! And this poor Matcham , too to what a cockatrice s nest have I not led him ! "
36048	36053	36054	36054	he	76	" A new chamber ? "
36057	36064	36054	36054	he	76	" Wherefore so ? What chamber ? "
36065	36072	36074	36075	the messenger	484	" Tis one above the chapel , "
36077	36084	36086	36086	Dick	76	" It hath stood long empty , "
36090	36098	36086	36086	Dick	76	" What manner of room is it ? "
36099	36106	36108	36109	the man	3175	" Nay , a brave room , "
36111	36114	36116	36116	his	3175	" But yet "
36118	36124	36116	36116	his	3175	" they call it haunted . "
36125	36128	36130	36130	Dick	76	" Haunted ? "
36136	36152	36130	36130	Dick	76	" I have not heard of it . Nay , then , and by whom ? "
36167	36176	36177	36177	he	484	" By the sacrist of St. John s , "
36180	36221	36177	36177	he	484	" They had him there to sleep one night , and in the morning whew ! he was gone . The devil had taken him , they said ; the more betoken , he had drunk late the night before . "
36379	36382	36383	36383	he	72	" Bennet , "
36386	36417	36383	36383	he	72	" this John Amend - All is no more than a man , ye see . He sleepeth . We will make a good end of him , go to ! "
36894	36903	37109	37110	the other	311	" Dick , Dick , it is I ! "
36938	36944	36945	36945	he	120	" Shut me the door , "
36948	36978	36945	36945	he	120	" Swift , Dick ! This house is full of spies ; I hear their feet follow me in the corridors ; I hear them breathe behind the arras . "
36979	36985	36987	36987	Dick	76	" Well , content you , "
36989	37035	36987	36987	Dick	76	" it is closed . We are safe for this while , if there be safety anywhere within these walls . But my heart is glad to see you . By the mass , lad , I thought ye were sped ! Where hid ye ? "
37036	37041	37043	37043	Matcham	120	" It matters not , "
37045	37075	37043	37043	Matcham	120	" Since we be met , it matters not . But , Dick , are your eyes open ? Have they told you of to - morrow s doings ? "
37076	37080	37082	37082	Dick	76	" Not they , "
37084	37092	37082	37082	Dick	76	" What make they to - morrow ? "
37093	37107	37109	37110	the other	311	" To - morrow , or to - night , I know not , "
37112	37150	37109	37110	the other	311	" but one time or other , Dick , they do intend upon your life . I had the proof of it ; I have heard them whisper ; nay , they as good as told me . "
37151	37154	37156	37156	Dick	76	" Ay , "
37158	37169	37156	37156	Dick	76	" is it so ? I had thought as much . "
37199	37202	37203	37203	he	120	" No , "
37206	37299	37203	37203	he	120	" there is no entrance visible . Yet tis a pure certainty there is one . Dick , I will stay by you . An y are to die , I will die with you . And I can help look ! I have stolen a dagger I will do my best ! And meanwhile , an ye know of any issue , any sally - port we could get opened , or any window that we might descend by , I will most joyfully face any jeopardy to flee with you . "
37300	37303	37305	37305	Dick	76	" Jack , "
37307	37338	37305	37305	Dick	76	" by the mass , Jack , y are the best soul , and the truest , and the bravest in all England ! Give me your hand , Jack . "
37349	37355	37356	37356	he	76	" I will tell you , "
37359	37385	37356	37356	he	76	" There is a window , out of which the messenger descended ; the rope should still be in the chamber . Tis a hope . "
37386	37389	37391	37391	Matcham	128	" Hist ! "
37414	37423	37425	37425	Matcham	128	" Some one walketh in the room below , "
37427	37430	37432	37432	Dick	76	" Nay , "
37434	37469	37471	37471	he	128	" there is no room below ; we are above the chapel . It is my murderer in the secret passage . Well , let him come ; it shall go hard with him ; "
37476	37483	37485	37486	the other	311	" Blow me the lights out , "
37488	37495	37485	37486	the other	311	" Perchance he will betray himself . "
37769	37772	37759	37760	Sir Daniel	72	" Joanna . "
37773	37776	37778	37778	Dick	76	" Joanna ! "
37780	37804	37778	37778	Dick	76	" Why , who the murrain should this be ? Here is no Joanna , nor ever hath been . What meaneth it ? "
37847	37850	37852	37852	Dick	76	" Jack , "
37854	37869	37852	37852	Dick	76	" I wot not where ye were all day . Saw ye this Joanna ? "
37870	37873	37875	37875	Matcham	128	" Nay , "
37877	37883	37875	37875	Matcham	128	" I saw her not . "
37884	37891	37892	37892	he	128	" Nor heard tell of her ? "
37913	37920	37922	37922	Dick	76	" Did ye hear of her ? "
37924	37930	37932	37932	Matcham	128	" I heard of her , "
37934	37944	37946	37946	Dick	76	" How your voice twitters ! What aileth you ? "
37948	37967	37946	37946	Dick	76	" Tis a most excellent good fortune , this Joanna ; it will take their minds from us . "
37968	37971	37973	37973	Matcham	128	" Dick , "
37975	38035	37973	37973	Matcham	128	" I am lost ; we are both lost . Let us flee if there be yet time . They will not rest till they have found me . Or , see ! let me go forth ; when they have found me , ye may flee . Let me forth , Dick good Dick , let me away ! "
38049	38054	38055	38055	he	76	" By the mass ! "
38058	38079	38055	38055	he	76	" y are no Jack ; y are Joanna Sedley ; y are the maid that would not marry me ! "
38105	38108	38109	38109	he	76	" Joanna , "
38112	38215	38109	38109	he	76	" y ave saved my life , and I have saved yours ; and we have seen blood flow , and been friends and enemies ay , and I took my belt to thrash you ; and all that time I thought ye were a boy . But now death has me , and my time s out , and before I die I must say this : Y are the best maid and the bravest under heaven , and , if only I could live , I would marry you blithely ; and , live or die , I love you . "
38220	38223	38224	38224	he	1129	" Come , "
38227	38246	38224	38224	he	1129	" speak up , Jack . Come , be a good maid , and say ye love me ! "
38247	38252	38253	38253	she	1128	" Why , Dick , "
38256	38262	38253	38253	she	1128	" would I be here ? "
38263	38270	38272	38272	Dick	76	" Well , see ye here , "
38274	38313	38272	38272	Dick	76	" an we but escape whole we ll marry ; and an we re to die , we die , and there s an end on t. But now that I think , how found ye my chamber ? "
38314	38322	38323	38323	she	1128	" I asked it of Dame Hatch , "
38326	38334	38335	38335	he	76	" Well , the dame s staunch , "
38338	38352	38335	38335	he	76	" she ll not tell upon you . We have time before us . "
38379	38382	38414	38414	she	1127	" Here ! "
38387	38395	38414	38414	she	1127	" Open , Master Dick ; open ! "
38402	38408	38410	38411	the girl	1127	" It is all over , "
38450	38453	38455	38456	the knight	438	" Dick , "
38458	38489	38455	38456	the knight	438	" be not an ass . The Seven Sleepers had been awake ere now . We know she is within there . Open , then , the door , man . "
38495	38500	38502	38503	Sir Daniel	72	" Down with it , "
38616	38619	38621	38621	Dick	76	" Now , "
38623	38628	38621	38621	Dick	76	" we are saved . "
38648	38664	38665	38665	he	76	" Help me , Jack . For your life s sake , help me stoutly ! "
38696	38704	38706	38706	Joanna	117	" Ye do but make things worse , "
38710	38719	38706	38706	Joanna	117	" He will then enter by the trap . "
38720	38724	38726	38726	Dick	76	" Not so , "
38728	38762	38726	38726	Dick	76	" He durst not tell his secret to so many . It is by the trap that we shall flee . Hark ! The attack is over . Nay , it was none ! "
38835	38841	38843	38843	Dick	76	" He will return anon , "
38845	38850	38843	38843	Dick	76	" To the trap ! "
38963	38966	38968	38968	Dick	76	" Now , "
38970	38986	38968	38968	Dick	76	" go first and take the lamp . I will follow to close the trap . "
39311	39317	39319	39319	Dick	76	" Here is no help , "
39321	39327	39319	39319	Dick	76	" Let us try back . "
39328	39331	39333	39333	Joanna	117	" Nay , "
39335	39342	39333	39333	Joanna	117	" maybe the passage goeth farther . "
39489	39497	39498	39498	Dick	76	" We must be in the dungeons , "
39501	39509	39511	39511	Joanna	117	" And still there is no outlet , "
39513	39523	39524	39524	Dick	76	" Nay , but an outlet there must be ! "
39580	39586	39588	39588	Joanna	117	" Some one holdeth it , "
39590	39594	39596	39596	Dick	76	" Not so , "
39598	39715	39596	39596	Dick	76	" for were a man strong as ten , he must still yield a little . But this resisteth like dead rock . There is a weight upon the trap . Here is no issue ; and , by my sooth , good Jack , we are here as fairly prisoners as though the gyves were on our ankle bones . Sit ye then down , and let us talk . After a while we shall return , when perchance they shall be less carefully upon their guard ; and , who knoweth ? we may break out and stand a chance . But , in my poor opinion , we are as good as shent . "
39716	39719	39720	39720	she	117	" Dick ! "
39723	39752	39720	39720	she	117	" alas the day that ever ye should have seen me ! For like a most unhappy and unthankful maid , it is I have led you hither . "
39753	39757	39759	39759	Dick	76	" What cheer ! "
39761	39820	39759	39759	Dick	76	" It was all written , and that which is written , willy nilly , cometh still to pass . But tell me a little what manner of a maid ye are , and how ye came into Sir Daniel s hands ; that will do better than to bemoan yourself , whether for your sake or mine . "
39821	39835	39837	39837	Joanna	117	" I am an orphan , like yourself , of father and mother , "
39839	40075	39837	39837	Joanna	117	" and for my great misfortune , Dick , and hitherto for yours , I am a rich marriage . My Lord Foxham had me to ward ; yet it appears Sir Daniel bought the marriage of me from the king , and a right dear price he paid for it . So here was I , poor babe , with two great and rich men fighting which should marry me , and I still at nurse ! Well , then the world changed , and there was a new chancellor , and Sir Daniel bought the warding of me over the Lord Foxham s head . And then the world changed again , and Lord Foxham bought my marriage over Sir Daniel s ; and from then to now it went on ill betwixt the two of them . But still Lord Foxham kept me in his hands , and was a good lord to me . And at last I was to be married or sold , if ye like it better . Five hundred pounds Lord Foxham was to get for me . Hamley was the groom s name , and to - morrow , Dick , of all days in the year , was I to be betrothed . Had it not come to Sir Daniel , I had been wedded , sure and never seen thee , Dick dear Dick ! "
40104	40107	40108	40108	she	1168	" Well , "
40112	40186	40108	40108	she	1168	" Sir Daniel took me unawares in the garden , and made me dress in these men s clothes , which is a deadly sin for a woman ; and , besides , they fit me not . He rode with me to Kettley , as ye saw , telling me I was to marry you ; but I , in my heart , made sure I would marry Hamley in his teeth . "
40187	40190	40192	40192	Dick	76	" Ay ! "
40194	40202	40192	40192	Dick	76	" and so ye loved this Hamley ! "
40203	40206	40208	40208	Joanna	117	" Nay , "
40210	40302	40208	40208	Joanna	117	" not I. I did but hate Sir Daniel . And then , Dick , ye helped me , and ye were right kind , and very bold , and my heart turned towards you in mine own despite ; and now , if we can in any way compass it , I would marry you with right goodwill . And if , by cruel destiny , it may not be , still ye ll be dear to me . While my heart beats , it ll be true to you . "
40303	40307	40309	40309	Dick	76	" And I , "
40311	40390	40391	40391	he	1170	" that never cared a straw for any manner of woman until now , I took to you when I thought ye were a boy . I had a pity to you , and knew not why . When I would have belted you , the hand failed me . But when ye owned ye were a maid , Jack for still I will call you Jack I made sure ye were the maid for me . Hark ! "
40396	40400	40391	40391	he	1170	" one cometh . "
40524	40529	40531	40531	Dick	76	" Stand , Bennet ! "
40533	40542	40531	40531	Dick	76	" Another step , and y are dead . "
40543	40549	40551	40551	Hatch	77	" So here ye are , "
40559	40641	40551	40551	Hatch	77	" I see you not . Aha ! y ave done wisely , Dick ; y ave put your lamp before you . By my sooth , but , though it was done to shoot my own knave body , I do rejoice to see ye profit of my lessons ! And now , what make ye ? what seek ye here ? Why would ye shoot upon an old , kind friend ? And have ye the young gentlewoman there ? "
40642	40656	40658	40658	Dick	76	" Nay , Bennet , it is I should question and you answer , "
40660	40709	40658	40658	Dick	76	" Why am I in this jeopardy of my life ? Why do men come privily to slay me in my bed ? Why am I now fleeing in mine own guardian s strong house , and from the friends that I have lived among and never injured ? "
40710	40717	40719	40719	Bennet	77	" Master Dick , Master Dick , "
40721	40742	40719	40719	Bennet	77	" what told I you ? Y are brave , but the most uncrafty lad that I can think upon ! "
40743	40746	40748	40748	Dick	76	" Well , "
40750	40788	40748	40748	Dick	76	" I see ye know all , and that I am doomed indeed . It is well . Here , where I am , I stay . Let Sir Daniel get me out if he be able ! "
40796	40800	40801	40801	he	77	" Hark ye , "
40804	40852	40801	40801	he	77	" return to Sir Daniel , to tell him where ye are , and how posted ; for , in truth , it was to that end he sent me . But you , if ye are no fool , had best be gone ere I return . "
40853	40856	40858	40858	Dick	76	" Begone ! "
40860	40879	40858	40858	Dick	76	" I would be gone already , an I wist how . I can not move the trap . "
40880	40896	40898	40898	Bennet	77	" Put me your hand into the corner , and see what ye find there , "
40900	40915	40898	40898	Bennet	77	" Throgmorton s rope is still in the brown chamber . Fare ye well . "
41181	41184	41185	41185	she	117	" Dick , "
41188	41208	41185	41185	she	117	" is it so deep ? I may not essay it . I should infallibly fall , good Dick . "
41261	41265	41257	41258	a sentinel	1061	" Who goes ? "
41266	41270	41272	41272	Dick	76	" A murrain ! "
41274	41287	41272	41272	Dick	76	" We are paid now ! Down with you take the rope . "
41288	41293	41294	41294	she	117	" I can not , "
41299	41310	41312	41312	Shelton	76	" An ye can not , no more can I , "
41314	41331	41312	41312	Shelton	76	" How can I swim the moat without you ? Do you desert me , then ? "
41332	41335	41336	41336	she	117	" Dick , "
41339	41351	41336	41336	she	117	" I can not . The strength is gone from me . "
41352	41364	41365	41365	he	76	" By the mass , then , we are all shent ! "
42287	42290	42292	42292	Dick	76	" Well , "
42294	42344	42292	42292	Dick	76	" between then and now I will find me the means to bring that traitor under ; for I think , by the mass , that I be now absolved from any gratitude or obligation ; and when war is open , there is a fair chance for all . "
42798	42801	42803	42803	he	76	" Come , "
42805	42834	42803	42803	he	76	" if the world changes yet again , I may have here the wherewithal to shame Sir Daniel nay , and perchance to bring him to the block . "
42929	42932	42934	42934	Dick	76	" Stand ? "
42936	42947	42934	42934	Dick	76	" By the mass , but I am nearer falling . "
42992	42997	42999	43003	the younger of the two	1217	" Why , Lawless , "
43005	43011	42999	43003	the younger of the two	1217	" it is young Shelton . "
43012	43028	43030	43031	the other	311	" Ay , this will be as good as bread to John Amend - All , "
43033	43064	43030	43031	the other	311	" Though , faith , he hath been to the wars . Here is a tear in his scalp that must a cost him many a good ounce of blood . "
43065	43069	43071	43071	Greensheve	160	" And here , "
43073	43120	43071	43071	Greensheve	160	" is a hole in his shoulder that must have pricked him well . Who hath done this , think ye ? If it be one of ours , he may all to prayer ; Ellis will give him a short shrift and a long rope . "
43121	43127	43129	43129	Lawless	132	" Up with the cub , "
43131	43138	43129	43129	Lawless	132	" Clap him on my back . "
43178	43195	43171	43175	the ex - Grey Friar	1221	" Keep ye the post , brother Greensheve . I will on with him by myself . "
43308	43312	43314	43317	the man in command	1230	" Who goes ? "
43319	43336	43338	43339	the outlaw	1231	" Will Lawless , by the rood ye know me as well as your own hand , "
43343	43350	43352	43353	the other	311	" Give the word , Lawless , "
43355	43366	43368	43368	Lawless	132	" Now , Heaven lighten thee , thou great fool , "
43370	43417	43368	43368	Lawless	132	" Did I not tell it thee myself ? But ye are all mad for this playing at soldiers . When I am in the greenwood , give me greenwood ways ; and my word for this tide is : A fig for all mock soldiery ! "
43418	43436	43438	43442	the commander of the post	1233	" Lawless , ye but show an ill example ; give us the word , fool jester , "
43444	43452	43454	43455	the other	311	" And if I had forgotten it ? "
43457	43483	43485	43486	the first	1235	" An ye had forgotten it as I know y ave not by the mass , I would clap an arrow into your big body , "
43488	43499	43501	43501	Lawless	132	" Nay , an y are so ill a jester , "
43503	43540	43501	43501	Lawless	132	" ye shall have your word for me . Duckworth and Shelton is the word ; and here , to the illustration , is Shelton on my shoulders , and to Duckworth do I carry him . "
43541	43546	43548	43549	the sentry	1236	" Pass , Lawless , "
43551	43557	43559	43561	the Grey Friar	1237	" And where is John ? "
43563	43582	43584	43587	another of the company	1238	" He holdeth a court , by the mass , and taketh rents as to the manner born ! "
43733	43737	43739	43739	Ellis	100	" Dear lad , "
43745	43801	43739	43739	Ellis	100	" y are in a friend s hands that loved your father , and loves you for his sake . Rest ye a little quietly , for ye are somewhat out of case . Then shall ye tell me your story , and betwixt the two of us we shall find a remedy for all . "
43918	43921	43923	43923	Ellis	100	" Well , "
43930	44006	43923	43923	Ellis	100	" see what the kind saints have done for you , Dick Shelton , not alone to save your body in so numerous and deadly perils , but to bring you into my hands that have no dearer wish than to assist your father s son . Be but true to me and I see y are true and betwixt you and me , we shall bring that false - heart traitor to the death . "
44007	44014	44016	44016	Dick	76	" Will ye assault the house ? "
44018	44030	44032	44032	Ellis	100	" I were mad , indeed , to think of it , "
44034	44103	44032	44032	Ellis	100	" He hath too much power ; his men gather to him ; those that gave me the slip last night , and by the mass came in so handily for you those have made him safe . Nay , Dick , to the contrary , thou and I and my brave bowmen , we must all slip from this forest speedily , and leave Sir Daniel free . "
44104	44112	44114	44115	the lad	309	" My mind misgiveth me for Jack , "
44117	44121	44123	44123	Duckworth	100	" For Jack ! "
44125	44245	44123	44123	Duckworth	100	" O , I see , for the wench ! Nay , Dick , I promise you , if there come talk of any marriage we shall act at once ; till then , or till the time is ripe , we shall all disappear , even like shadows at morning ; Sir Daniel shall look east and west , and see none enemies ; he shall think , by the mass , that he hath dreamed awhile , and hath now awakened in his bed . But our four eyes , Dick , shall follow him right close , and our four hands so help us all the army of the saints ! shall bring that traitor low ! "
44837	44840	44842	44848	one of the men at the table	1289	" Nay , "
44850	44918	44842	44848	one of the men at the table	1289	" I like it not . Ill will come of it . This is no place for jolly fellows . A jolly fellow loveth open country , good cover , and scarce foes ; but here we are shut in a town , girt about with enemies ; and , for the bull s - eye of misfortune , see if it snow not ere the morning . "
44919	44926	44931	44931	his	1291	" Tis for Master Shelton there , "
44940	44949	44951	44952	the first	1235	" I will do much for Master Shelton , "
44954	44971	44951	44952	the first	1235	" but to come to the gallows for any man nay , brothers , not that ! "
44992	44996	44997	44997	he	675	" Master Shelton , "
45000	45014	44997	44997	he	675	" Sir Daniel goeth forth with a pair of links and four archers . "
45028	45031	45032	45032	he	675	" Lawless , "
45035	45068	45032	45032	he	675	" ye will take John Capper s watch . Greensheve , follow with me . Capper , lead forward . We will follow him this time , an he go to York . "
45192	45202	45204	45204	Dick	76	" He hath gone each night in this direction ? "
45210	45221	45223	45223	Capper	166	" This is the third night running , Master Shelton , "
45225	45246	45223	45223	Capper	166	" and still at the same hour and with the same small following , as though his end were secret . "
45412	45415	45417	45417	Dick	76	" Hey , "
45419	45424	45417	45417	Dick	76	" I smell treason . "
45495	45503	45505	45506	Sir Daniel	72	" Is it you , my lord ? "
45508	45527	45529	45534	the leader of the second troop	1335	" It is I , indeed ; and if ever true knight gave proof I am that man , "
45536	45555	45529	45534	the leader of the second troop	1335	" for who would not rather face giants , sorcerers , or pagans , than this pinching cold ? "
45556	45560	45562	45563	Sir Daniel	72	" My lord , "
45565	45599	45562	45563	Sir Daniel	72	" beauty will be the more beholden , misdoubt it not . But shall we forth ? for the sooner ye have seen my merchandise , the sooner shall we both get home . "
45600	45611	45613	45614	the other	311	" But why keep ye her here , good knight ? "
45616	45674	45613	45614	the other	311	" An she be so young , and so fair , and so wealthy , why do ye not bring her forth among her mates ? Ye would soon make her a good marriage , and no need to freeze your fingers and risk arrow - shots by going abroad at such untimely seasons in the dark . "
45675	45684	45686	45687	Sir Daniel	72	" I have told you , my lord , "
45689	45760	45686	45687	Sir Daniel	72	" the reason thereof concerneth me only . Neither do I purpose to explain it farther . Suffice it , that if ye be weary of your old gossip , Daniel Brackley , publish it abroad that y are to we d Joanna Sedley , and I give you my word ye will be quit of him right soon . Ye will find him with an arrow in his back . "
46086	46097	46098	46098	he	76	" Capper , ye will give me a back up , "
46130	46135	46137	46137	Dick	76	" Now , Greensheve , "
46139	46177	46137	46137	Dick	76	" follow me up here ; lie flat upon your face , that ye may be the less seen ; and be ever ready to give me a hand if I fall foully on the other side . "
46632	46635	46642	46642	he	76	" Hist ! "
46649	46653	46654	46654	he	76	" Who goes ? "
46657	46660	46642	46642	he	76	" Greensheve , "
46670	46675	46677	46677	Dick	76	" What want ye ? "
46679	46688	46690	46691	the outlaw	1231	" The house is watched , Master Shelton , "
46693	46731	46690	46691	the outlaw	1231	" We are not alone to watch it ; for even as I lay on my belly on the wall I saw men prowling in the dark , and heard them whistle softly one to the other . "
46732	46737	46739	46739	Dick	76	" By my sooth , "
46741	46757	46739	46739	Dick	76	" but this is passing strange ! Were they not men of Sir Daniel s ? "
46758	46768	46770	46770	Greensheve	160	" Nay , sir , that they were not , "
46772	46802	46770	46770	Greensheve	160	" for if I have eyes in my head , every man - Jack of them weareth me a white badge in his bonnet , something chequered with dark . "
46803	46810	46812	46812	Dick	76	" White , chequered with dark , "
46814	46905	46812	46812	Dick	76	" Faith , tis a badge I know not . It is none of this country s badges . Well , an that be so , let us slip as quietly forth from this garden as we may ; for here we are in an evil posture for defence . Beyond all question there are men of Sir Daniel s in that house , and to be taken between two shots is a beggarman s position . Take me this ladder ; I must leave it where I found it . "
46987	46993	46995	46995	Dick	76	" Now , John Capper , "
46997	47086	47087	47087	he	1383	" back with you to Shoreby , even as for your life . Bring me instantly what men ye can collect . Here shall be the rendezvous ; or if the men be scattered and the day be near at hand before they muster , let the place be something farther back , and by the entering in of the town . Greensheve and I lie here to watch . Speed ye , John Capper , and the saints aid you to despatch . And now , Greensheve , "
47097	47122	47087	47087	he	1383	" let thou and I go round about the garden in a wide circuit . I would fain see whether thine eyes betrayed thee . "
47327	47333	47334	47334	Dick	76	" They keep good watch , "
47337	47347	47349	47349	Greensheve	160	" Let us back to land , good master , "
47351	47384	47349	47349	Greensheve	160	" We stand here too open ; for , look ye , when the seas break heavy and white out there behind us , they shall see us plainly against the foam . "
47385	47390	47392	47392	Dick	76	" Ye speak sooth , "
47394	47402	47392	47392	Dick	76	" Ashore with us , right speedily . "
47426	47436	47438	47438	Dick	76	" I pray Heaven that Capper make good speed ! "
47440	47457	47438	47438	Dick	76	" I vow a candle to St. Mary of Shoreby if he come before the hour ! "
47458	47468	47470	47470	Greensheve	160	" Y are in a hurry , Master Dick ? "
47472	47478	47480	47480	Dick	76	" Ay , good fellow , "
47482	47513	47480	47480	Dick	76	" for in that house lieth my lady , whom I love , and who should these be that lie about her secretly by night ? Unfriends , for sure ! "
47514	47517	47519	47519	Greensheve	160	" Well , "
47521	47604	47519	47519	Greensheve	160	" an John come speedily , we shall give a good account of them . They are not two score at the outside I judge so by the spacing of their sentries and , taken where they are , lying so widely , one score would scatter them like sparrows . And yet , Master Dick , an she be in Sir Daniel s power already , it will little hurt that she should change into another s. Who should these be ? "
47605	47614	47615	47615	Dick	76	" I do suspect the Lord of Shoreby , "
47618	47623	47615	47615	Dick	76	" When came they ? "
47624	47633	47635	47635	Greensheve	160	" They began to come , Master Dick , "
47637	47669	47635	47635	Greensheve	160	" about the time ye crossed the wall . I had not lain there the space of a minute ere I marked the first of the knaves crawling round the corner . "
47882	47887	47889	47889	he	76	" Now , Kit , "
47894	48012	47889	47889	he	76	" take me your men to the near angle of the garden wall upon the beach . Post them strongly , and wait till that ye hear me falling on upon the other side . It is those upon the sea front that I would fain make certain of , for there will be the leader . The rest will run ; even let them . And now , lads , let no man draw an arrow ; ye will but hurt friends . Take to the steel , and keep to the steel ; and if we have the uppermost , I promise every man of you a gold noble when I come to mine estate . "
49033	49037	49038	49038	he	76	" Yield ye ! "
49041	49047	49038	49038	he	76	" I give you life . "
49048	49053	49055	49056	the other	311	" I yield me , "
49063	49089	49055	49056	the other	311	" Ye fight , like a young man , ignorantly and foolhardily ; but , by the array of the saints , ye fight bravely ! "
49129	49138	49140	49142	the conquered knight	1452	" Lead me to your captain , youth , "
49144	49153	49140	49142	the conquered knight	1452	" It is fit this butchery should cease . "
49154	49157	49159	49159	Dick	76	" Sir , "
49161	49182	49159	49159	Dick	76	" so far as these brave fellows have a captain , the poor gentleman who here addresses you is he . "
49183	49199	49201	49202	the other	311	" Call off your dogs , then , and I will bid my villains hold , "
49228	49236	49238	49240	the stranger knight	1455	" Lay down your arms , men ! "
49242	49253	49238	49240	the stranger knight	1455	" I have yielded me , upon promise of life . "
49277	49280	49282	49282	Dick	76	" Lawless , "
49284	49289	49282	49282	Dick	76	" are ye safe ? "
49290	49293	49295	49295	Lawless	132	" Ay , "
49297	49302	49295	49295	Lawless	132	" safe and hearty . "
49303	49309	49311	49311	Dick	76	" Light me the lantern , "
49313	49320	49322	49323	the knight	438	" Is not Sir Daniel here ? "
49325	49329	49331	49331	Dick	76	" Sir Daniel ? "
49333	49354	49331	49331	Dick	76	" Now , by the rood , I pray not . It would go ill with me if he were . "
49355	49363	49365	49366	the other	311	" Ill with you , fair sir ? "
49368	49434	49365	49366	the other	311	" Nay , then , if ye be not of Sir Daniel s party , I profess I comprehend no longer . Wherefore , then , fell ye upon mine ambush ? in what quarrel , my young and very fiery friend ? to what earthly purpose ? and , to make a clear end of questioning , to what good gentleman have I surrendered ? "
49473	49477	49479	49479	he	76	" My lord , "
49481	49577	49479	49479	he	76	" if these gentlemen be unfriends to Sir Daniel , it is pity , indeed , we should have been at blows with them ; but it were tenfold greater that either they or we should linger here . The watchers in the house unless they be all dead or deaf have heard our hammering this quarter - hour agone ; instantly they will have signalled to the town ; and unless we be the livelier in our departure , we are like to be taken , both of us , by a fresh foe . "
49578	49585	49587	49588	the lord	1462	" Hawksley is in the right , "
49590	49602	49587	49588	the lord	1462	" How please ye , sir ? Whither shall we march ? "
49603	49609	49611	49611	Dick	76	" Nay , my lord , "
49613	49686	49611	49611	Dick	76	" go where ye will for me . I do begin to suspect we have some ground of friendship , and if , indeed , I began our acquaintance somewhat ruggedly , I would not churlishly continue . Let us , then , separate , my lord , you laying your right hand in mine ; and at the hour and place that ye shall name , let us encounter and agree . "
49687	49695	49697	49698	the other	311	" Y are too trustful , boy , "
49700	49731	49697	49698	the other	311	" but this time your trust is not misplaced . I will meet you at the point of day at St. Bride s Cross . Come , lads , follow ! "
50284	50296	50297	50297	he	76	" I thank you , my lord , for your exactitude , "
50304	50316	50297	50297	he	76	" Will it please your lordship to set foot to earth ? "
50317	50326	50328	50329	the other	311	" Are ye here alone , young man ? "
50331	50338	50340	50340	Dick	76	" I was not so simple , "
50342	50371	50340	50340	Dick	76	" and , to be plain with your lordship , the woods upon either hand of this cross lie full of mine honest fellows lying on their weapons . "
50372	50378	50380	50381	the lord	1462	" Y ave done wisely , "
50383	50421	50380	50381	the lord	1462	" It pleaseth me the rather , since last night ye fought foolhardily , and more like a salvage Saracen lunatic than any Christian warrior . But it becomes not me to complain that had the undermost . "
50422	50437	50439	50439	Dick	76	" Ye had the undermost indeed , my lord , since ye so fell , "
50441	50510	50439	50439	Dick	76	" but had the waves not holpen me , it was I that should have had the worst . Ye were pleased to make me yours with several dagger marks , which I still carry . And in fine , my lord , methinks I had all the danger , as well as all the profit , of that little blind - man s mellay on the beach . "
50511	50525	50527	50528	the stranger	1456	" Y are shrewd enough to make light of it , I see , "
50530	50539	50541	50541	Dick	76	" Nay , my lord , not shrewd , "
50543	50625	50541	50541	Dick	76	" in that I shoot at no advantage to myself . But when , by the light of this new day , I see how stout a knight hath yielded , not to my arms alone , but to fortune , and the darkness , and the surf and how easily the battle had gone otherwise , with a soldier so untried and rustic as myself think it not strange , my lord , if I feel confounded with my victory . "
50626	50631	50633	50634	the stranger	1456	" Ye speak well , "
50636	50640	50633	50634	the stranger	1456	" Your name ? "
50641	50653	50655	50655	Dick	76	" My name , an t like you , is Shelton , "
50657	50665	50667	50668	the other	311	" Men call me the Lord Foxham , "
50670	50692	50694	50694	Dick	76	" Then , my lord , and under your good favour , ye are guardian to the sweetest maid in England , "
50696	50781	50694	50694	Dick	76	" and for your ransom , and the ransom of such as were taken with you on the beach , there will be no uncertainty of terms . I pray you , my lord , of your goodwill and charity , yield me the hand of my mistress , Joan Sedley ; and take ye , upon the other part , your liberty , the liberty of these your followers , and if ye will have it my gratitude and service till I die . "
50782	50810	50812	50813	Lord Foxham	157	" But are ye not ward to Sir Daniel ? Methought , if y are Harry Shelton s son , that I had heard it so reported , "
50815	50873	50878	50878	Dick	76	" Will it please you , my lord , to alight ? I would fain tell you fully who I am , how situate , and why so bold in my demands . Beseech you , my lord , take place upon these steps , hear me to a full end , and judge me with allowance . "
50943	50947	50948	50948	he	76	" Master Shelton , "
50951	51119	50948	50948	he	76	" ye are a most fortunate - unfortunate young gentleman ; but what fortune y ave had , that ye have amply merited ; and what unfortune , ye have noways deserved . Be of a good cheer ; for ye have made a friend who is devoid neither of power nor favour . For yourself , although it fits not for a person of your birth to herd with outlaws , I must own ye are both brave and honourable ; very dangerous in battle , right courteous in peace ; a youth of excellent disposition and brave bearing . For your estates , ye will never see them till the world shall change again ; so long as Lancaster hath the strong hand , so long shall Sir Daniel enjoy them for his own . For my ward , it is another matter ; I had promised her before to a gentleman , a kinsman of my house , one Hamley ; the promise is old "
51120	51138	51140	51140	Dick	76	" Ay , my lord , and now Sir Daniel hath promised her to my Lord Shoreby , "
51142	51163	51140	51140	Dick	76	" And his promise , for all it is but young , is still the likelier to be made good . "
51164	51170	51172	51173	his lordship	1511	" Tis the plain truth , "
51175	51223	51172	51173	his lordship	1511	" And considering , moreover , that I am your prisoner , upon no better composition than my bare life , and over and above that , that the maiden is unhappily in other hands , I will so far consent . Aid me with your good fellows "
51224	51228	51230	51230	Dick	76	" My lord , "
51232	51246	51230	51230	Dick	76	" they are these same outlaws that ye blame me for consorting with . "
51247	51259	51261	51262	Lord Foxham	157	" Let them be what they will , they can fight , "
51264	51289	51261	51262	Lord Foxham	157	" Help me , then ; and if between us we regain the maid , upon my knightly honour , she shall marry you ! "
51319	51322	51323	51323	he	76	" Come , "
51326	51340	51323	51323	he	76	" an y are to marry Joan , we must be early friends . "
51657	51660	51661	51661	he	76	" Lawless ! "
51664	51678	51661	51661	he	76	" you that were a shipman , can ye steal me a ship ? "
51679	51683	51685	51685	Lawless	132	" Master Dick , "
51687	51702	51685	51685	Lawless	132	" if ye would back me , I would agree to steal York Minster . "
52083	52088	52090	52090	Lawless	132	" There , sir , "
52092	52107	52090	52090	Lawless	132	" mark ye it well ! There is the ship for to - night . "
52143	52149	52150	52150	he	132	" How call ye her ? "
52159	52170	52172	52173	the loiterer	1559	" They call her the Good Hope , of Dartmouth , "
52175	52192	52172	52173	the loiterer	1559	" Her captain , Arblaster by name . He pulleth the bow oar in yon skiff . "
52249	52255	52256	52256	he	132	" What ! Gossip Arblaster ! "
52259	52378	52256	52256	he	132	" Why , ye be well met ; nay , gossip , ye be right well met , upon the rood ! And is that the Good Hope ? Ay , I would know her among ten thousand ! a sweet shear , a sweet boat ! But marry come up , my gossip , will ye drink ? I have come into mine estate which doubtless ye remember to have heard on . I am now rich ; I have left to sail upon the sea ; I do sail now , for the most part , upon spiced ale . Come , fellow ; thy hand upon t ! Come , drink with an old shipfellow ! "
52484	52487	52488	52488	he	132	" Nay , "
52491	52522	52523	52523	he	132	" I can not mind you . But what o that ? I would drink with any man , gossip , and so would my man Tom . Man Tom , "
52530	52562	52523	52523	he	132	" here is my gossip , whose name I can not mind , but no doubt a very good seaman . Let s go drink with him and his shore friend . "
52680	52685	52687	52687	Lawless	132	" Ay , now , "
52689	52735	52687	52687	Lawless	132	" here is a shipman s joy a good fire and a good stiff cup ashore , with foul weather without and an off - sea gale a - snoring in the roof ! Here s to the Good Hope ! May she ride easy ! "
52736	52739	52741	52742	Skipper Arblaster	171	" Ay , "
52744	52796	52741	52742	Skipper Arblaster	171	" tis good weather to be ashore in , that is sooth . Man Tom , how say ye to that ? Gossip , ye speak well , though I can never think upon your name ; but ye speak very well . May the Good Hope ride easy ! Amen ! "
52797	52801	52803	52803	Lawless	132	" Friend Dickon , "
52809	52884	52803	52803	Lawless	132	" ye have certain matters on hand , unless I err ? Well , prithee be about them incontinently . For here I be with the choice of all good company , two tough old shipmen ; and till that ye return I will go warrant these brave fellows will bide here and drink me cup for cup . We are not like shore - men , we old , tough tarry - Johns ! "
52885	52891	52893	52894	the skipper	1580	" It is well meant , "
52896	52972	52893	52894	the skipper	1580	" Ye can go , boy ; for I will keep your good friend and my good gossip company till curfew ay , and by St. Mary , till the sun get up again ! For , look ye , when a man hath been long enough at sea , the salt getteth me into the clay upon his bones ; and let him drink a draw - well , he will never be quenched . "
53462	53473	53475	53477	the young commander	1618	" Well , Jack , keep me a good watch , "
53485	53492	53475	53477	the young commander	1618	" Ye will do right well . "
53493	53496	53498	53498	Jack	128	" Why , "
53500	53567	53498	53498	Jack	128	" I shall do excellent well indeed , so long as we lie here ; but once we put the nose of this poor ship outside the harbour See , there she trembles ! Nay , the poor shrew heard the words , and the heart misgave her in her oak - tree ribs . But look , Master Dick ! how black the weather gathers ! "
53635	53643	53645	53645	Dick	76	" In sooth , it looketh evilly , "
53647	53664	53645	53645	Dick	76	" But what cheer ! Tis but a squall , and presently it will blow over . "
53810	53814	53815	53815	he	76	" Young Shelton , "
53818	53828	53815	53815	he	76	" are ye for sea , then , truly ? "
53829	53833	53835	53835	Richard	74	" My lord , "
53837	53929	53835	53835	Richard	74	" they lie about the house with horsemen ; it may not be reached from the land side without alarum ; and Sir Daniel once advertised of our adventure , we can no more carry it to a good end than , saving your presence , we could ride upon the wind . Now , in going round by sea , we do run some peril by the elements ; but , what much outweighteth all , we have a chance to make good our purpose and bear off the maid . "
53930	53933	53935	53936	Lord Foxham	157	" Well , "
53938	53966	53935	53936	Lord Foxham	157	" lead on . I will , in some sort , follow you for shame s sake ; but I own I would I were in bed . "
53967	53972	53974	53974	Dick	76	" Here , then , "
53976	53985	53974	53974	Dick	76	" Hither we go to fetch our pilot . "
54194	54197	54199	54200	the skipper	1580	" Hey ? "
54204	54211	54199	54200	the skipper	1580	" who are ye , hey ? "
54212	54224	54226	54226	Dick	76	" I want a word with you without , Master Arblaster , "
54228	54238	54226	54226	Dick	76	" and here is what we shall talk of . "
54268	54273	54274	54274	he	76	" Ay , boy , "
54277	54296	54274	54274	he	76	" I am with you . Gossip , I will be back anon . Drink fair , gossip ; "
55457	55467	55469	55469	another	992	" On board , lads , for your lives ! "
55490	55495	55539	55539	another	992	" We are betrayed ! "
55717	55728	55730	55730	he	132	" I have left my mark on them , gossip , "
55732	55739	55730	55730	he	132	" the yelping , coward hounds . "
55914	55917	55919	55922	one of the grumblers	1744	" What ! "
55924	55931	55919	55922	one of the grumblers	1744	" he carrieth us to seaward ! "
55932	55936	55938	55938	another	992	" Tis sooth , "
55940	55949	55938	55938	another	992	" Nay , we are betrayed for sure . "
56049	56054	56043	56043	they	1748	" crowing for courage . "
56097	56100	56101	56101	he	1751	" Lads , "
56104	56137	56101	56101	he	1751	" y are right wooden heads , I think . For to get back , by the mass , we must have an offing , must we not ? And this old Lawless "
56191	56195	56196	56196	he	132	" Steer yourselves , "
56477	56480	56481	56481	he	1763	" Lawless , "
56484	56522	56481	56481	he	1763	" we do all depend on you ; y are a brave , steady man , indeed , and crafty in the management of ships ; I shall put three sure men to watch upon your safety . "
56523	56531	56533	56534	the steersman	1766	" Bootless , my master , bootless , "
56542	56622	56533	56534	the steersman	1766	" We come every moment somewhat clearer of these sandbanks ; with every moment , then , the sea packeth upon us heavier , and for all these whimperers , they will presently be on their backs . For , my master , tis a right mystery , but true , there never yet was a bad man that was a good shipman . None but the honest and the bold can endure me this tossing of a ship . "
56623	56628	56630	56630	Dick	76	" Nay , Lawless , "
56634	56675	56630	56630	Dick	76	" that is a right shipman s byword , and hath no more of sense than the whistle of the wind . But , prithee , how go we ? Do we lie well ? Are we in good case ? "
56676	56680	56682	56682	Lawless	132	" Master Shelton , "
56684	56778	56682	56682	Lawless	132	" I have been a Grey Friar I praise fortune an archer , a thief , and a shipman . Of all these coats , I had the best fancy to die in the Grey Friar s , as ye may readily conceive , and the least fancy to die in John Shipman s tarry jacket ; and that for two excellent good reasons : first , that the death might take a man suddenly ; and second , for the horror of that great , salt smother and welter under my foot here "
56786	56789	56790	56790	he	132	" Howbeit , "
56794	56819	56790	56790	he	132	" an I die not a sailor s death , and that this night , I shall owe a tall candle to our Lady . "
56820	56825	56827	56827	Dick	76	" Is it so ? "
56829	56835	56837	56838	the outlaw	1231	" It is right so , "
56840	56918	56837	56838	the outlaw	1231	" Do ye not feel how heavy and dull she moves upon the waves ? Do ye not hear the water washing in her hold ? She will scarce mind the rudder even now . Bide till she has settled a bit lower ; and she will either go down below your boots like a stone image , or drive ashore here , under our lee , and come all to pieces like a twist of string . "
56919	56927	56929	56929	Dick	76	" Ye speak with a good courage , "
56931	56938	56929	56929	Dick	76	" Ye are not then appalled ? "
56939	56944	56946	56946	Lawless	132	" Why , master , "
56948	57019	56946	56946	Lawless	132	" if ever a man had an ill crew to come to port with , it is I a renegade friar , a thief , and all the rest on t. Well , ye may wonder , but I keep a good hope in my wallet ; and if that I be to drown , I will drown with a bright eye , Master Shelton , and a steady hand . "
57428	57434	57436	57436	he	76	" I am sore hurt , "
57438	57514	57436	57436	he	76	" Come near to my side , young Shelton ; let there be one by me who , at least , is gentle born ; for after having lived nobly and richly all the days of my life , this is a sad pass that I should get my hurt in a little ferreting skirmish , and die here , in a foul , cold ship upon the sea , among broken men and churls . "
57515	57521	57523	57523	Dick	76	" Nay , my lord , "
57525	57548	57523	57523	Dick	76	" I pray rather to the saints that ye will recover you of your hurt , and come soon and sound ashore . "
57549	57552	57554	57555	his lordship	1511	" How ! "
57557	57572	57554	57555	his lordship	1511	" Come sound ashore ? There is , then , a question of it ? "
57573	57584	57586	57587	the lad	309	" The ship laboureth the sea is grievous and contrary , "
57589	57617	57586	57587	the lad	309	" and by what I can learn of my fellow that steereth us , we shall do well , indeed , if we come dryshod to land . "
57618	57621	57623	57624	the baron	1354	" Ha ! "
57628	57704	57623	57624	the baron	1354	" thus shall every terror attend upon the passage of my soul ! Sir , pray rather to live hard , that ye may die easy , than to be fooled and fluted all through life , as to the pipe and tabor , and , in the last hour , be plunged among misfortunes ! Howbeit , I have that upon my mind that must not be delayed . We have no priest aboard ? "
57705	57708	57710	57710	Dick	76	" None , "
57712	57722	57724	57725	Lord Foxham	157	" Here , then , to my secular interests , "
57727	57836	57724	57725	Lord Foxham	157	" ye must be as good a friend to me dead , as I found you a gallant enemy when I was living . I fall in an evil hour for me , for England , and for them that trusted me . My men are being brought by Hamley he that was your rival ; they will rendezvous in the long holm at Holywood ; this ring from off my finger will accredit you to represent mine orders ; and I shall write , besides , two words upon this paper , bidding Hamley yield to you the damsel . Will he obey ? I know not . "
57837	57846	57848	57848	Dick	76	" But , my lord , what orders ? "
57850	57853	57855	57856	the baron	1354	" Ay , "
57858	57863	57865	57865	he	1354	" ay the orders ; "
57872	57879	57880	57880	he	1354	" Are ye Lancaster or York ? "
57886	57893	57895	57895	Dick	76	" I shame to say it , "
57897	57938	57895	57895	Dick	76	" I can scarce clearly answer . But so much I think is certain : since I serve with Ellis Duckworth , I serve the house of York . Well , if that be so , I declare for York . "
57939	57944	57946	57947	the other	311	" It is well , "
57949	58121	57946	57947	the other	311	" it is exceeding well . For , truly , had ye said Lancaster , I wot not for the world what I had done . But sith ye are for York , follow me . I came hither but to watch these lords at Shoreby , while mine excellent young lord , Richard of Gloucester , 1 prepareth a sufficient force to fall upon and scatter them . I have made me notes of their strength , what watch they keep , and how they lie ; and these I was to deliver to my young lord on Sunday , an hour before noon , at St. Bride s Cross beside the forest . This tryst I am not like to keep , but I pray you , of courtesy , to keep it in my stead ; and see that not pleasure , nor pain , tempest , wound , nor pestilence withhold you from the hour and place , for the welfare of England lieth upon this cast . "
58122	58132	58134	58134	Dick	76	" I do soberly take this up on me , "
58136	58151	58134	58134	Dick	76	" In so far as in me lieth , your purpose shall be done . "
58152	58157	58159	58161	the wounded man	1005	" It is good , "
58163	58209	58159	58161	the wounded man	1005	" My lord duke shall order you farther , and if ye obey him with spirit and good will , then is your fortune made . Give me the lamp a little nearer to mine eyes , till that I write these words for you . "
58214	58224	58134	58134	Dick	76	" to his worshipful kinsman , Sir John Hamley ; "
58238	58245	58246	58246	he	1005	" This is for the duke , "
58249	58265	58246	58246	he	1005	" The word is England and Edward , and the counter , England and York . "
58266	58273	58275	58275	Dick	76	" And Joanna , my lord ? "
58277	58288	58290	58291	the baron	1354	" Nay , ye must get Joanna how ye can , "
58293	58339	58290	58291	the baron	1354	" I have named you for my choice in both these letters ; but ye must get her for yourself , boy . I have tried , as ye see here before you , and have lost my life . More could no man do . "
58486	58492	58494	58494	Dick	76	" Are we going ashore ? "
58496	58499	58501	58501	Lawless	132	" Ay , "
58503	58512	58501	58501	Lawless	132	" unless we get first to the bottom . "
58546	58551	58553	58553	Dick	76	" By the mass ! "
58567	58583	58553	58553	Dick	76	" I thought we had foundered , indeed ; my heart was at my throat . "
58829	58834	58836	58836	Lawless	132	" Now , boys , "
58838	58884	58836	58836	Lawless	132	" the saints have had a care of us , indeed . The tide ebbs ; let us but sit down and drink a cup of wine , and before half an hour ye may all march me ashore as safe as on a bridge . "
58975	58979	58981	58982	young Shelton	74	" My lord , "
58984	59025	58981	58982	young Shelton	74	" fear not at all ; the saints are plainly for us ; the seas have cast us high upon a shoal , and as soon as the tide hath somewhat ebbed , we may walk ashore upon our feet . "
59089	59100	59101	59101	Dick	76	" They might draw near and offer us some comfort , "
59104	59122	59124	59124	Hawksley	170	" Well , an they come not to us , let us even turn aside to them , "
59126	59146	59124	59124	Hawksley	170	" The sooner we come to a good fire and a dry bed the better for my poor lord . "
59188	59193	59195	59196	his lordship	1511	" Back ! back ! "
59198	59211	59195	59196	his lordship	1511	" Beware , in Heaven s name , that ye reply not . "
59212	59215	59217	59217	Greensheve	160	" Nay , "
59227	59278	59217	59217	Greensheve	160	" We are in no posture to fight , it is certain , being drenching wet , dog - weary , and three - parts frozen ; but , for the love of old England , what aileth them to shoot thus cruelly on their poor country people in distress ? "
59279	59288	59290	59291	Lord Foxham	157	" They take us to be French pirates , "
59293	59348	59290	59291	Lord Foxham	157	" In these most troublesome and degenerate days we can not keep our own shores of England ; but our old enemies , whom we once chased on sea and land , do now range at pleasure , robbing and slaughtering and burning . It is the pity and reproach of this poor land . "
59934	59940	59942	59942	he	76	" Now , Master Richard , "
59944	59994	59942	59942	he	76	" an y are not too proud to be the guest of a man who is neither a gentleman by birth nor so much as a good Christian , I can offer you a cup of wine and a good fire to melt the marrow in your frozen bones . "
59995	60001	60003	60003	Dick	76	" Lead on , Will , "
60005	60028	60003	60003	Dick	76	" A cup of wine and a good fire ! Nay , I would go a far way round to see them . "
60306	60311	60312	60312	he	132	" Here , then , "
60315	60524	60312	60312	he	132	" is this old Lawless s rabbit - hole ; pray Heaven there come no terrier ! Far I have rolled hither and thither , and here and about , since that I was fourteen years of mine age and first ran away from mine abbey , with the sacrist s gold chain and a mass - book that I sold for four marks . I have been in England and France and Burgundy , and in Spain , too , on a pilgrimage for my poor soul ; and upon the sea , which is no man s country . But here is my place , Master Shelton . This is my native land , this burrow in the earth ! Come rain or wind and whether it s April , and the birds all sing , and the blossoms fall about my bed or whether it s winter , and I sit alone with my good gossip the fire , and robin red breast twitters in the woods here , is my church and market , and my wife and child . It s here I come back to , and it s here , so please the saints , that I would like to die . "
60525	60535	60537	60537	Dick	76	" Tis a warm corner , to be sure , "
60539	60549	60537	60537	Dick	76	" and a pleasant , and a well hid . "
60550	60557	60559	60559	Lawless	132	" It had need to be , "
60561	60580	60581	60581	he	132	" for an they found it , Master Shelton , it would break my heart . But here , "
60594	60612	60581	60581	he	132	" here is my wine cellar ; and ye shall have a flask of excellent strong stingo . "
60682	60686	60688	60689	the outlaw	1231	" Master Shelton , "
60691	60715	60688	60689	the outlaw	1231	" y ave had two mischances this last while , and y are like to lose the maid do I take it aright ? "
60716	60719	60721	60721	Dick	76	" Aright ! "
60727	60732	60734	60734	Lawless	132	" Well , now , "
60736	60849	60734	60734	Lawless	132	" hear an old fool that hath been nigh - hand everything , and seen nigh - hand all ! Ye go too much on other people s errands , Master Dick . Ye go on Ellis s ; but he desireth rather the death of Sir Daniel . Ye go on Lord Foxham s ; well the saints preserve him ! doubtless he meaneth well . But go ye upon your own , good Dick . Come right to the maid s side . Court her , lest that she forget you . Be ready ; and when the chance shall come , off with her at the saddle - bow . "
60850	60869	60871	60871	Dick	76	" Ay , but , Lawless , beyond doubt she is now in Sir Daniel s own mansion . "
60873	60881	60883	60884	the outlaw	1231	" Thither , then , go we , "
60891	60898	60900	60900	Lawless	132	" Nay , I mean it , "
60902	60921	60900	60900	Lawless	132	" And if y are of so little faith , and stumble at a word , see here ! "
60979	60982	60983	60983	he	1231	" Here , "
60986	60995	60983	60983	he	1231	" is for you . On with them ! "
61077	61080	61081	61081	he	132	" Now , "
61084	61128	61081	61081	he	132	" when I have done the like , we shall make as bonny a pair of friars as the eye could wish . Boldly to Sir Daniel s we shall go , and there be hospitably welcome for the love of Mother Church . "
61129	61136	61138	61139	the lad	309	" And how , dear Lawless , "
61141	61147	61081	61081	he	132	" shall I repay you ? "
61148	61153	61155	61156	the outlaw	1231	" Tut , brother , "
61158	61220	61155	61156	the outlaw	1231	" I do naught but for my pleasure . Mind not for me . I am one , by the mass , that mindeth for himself . When that I lack , I have a long tongue and a voice like the monastery bell I do ask , my son ; and where asking faileth , I do most usually take . "
61289	61295	61297	61298	the lad	309	" Wherefore do ye that ? "
61300	61310	61297	61298	the lad	309	" Wherefore arrows , when ye take no bow ? "
61311	61314	61316	61316	Lawless	132	" Nay , "
61320	61383	61316	61316	Lawless	132	" tis like there will be heads broke not to say backs ere you and I win sound from where we re going to ; and if any fall , I would our fellowship should come by the credit on t. A black arrow , Master Dick , is the seal of our abbey ; it showeth you who writ the bill . "
61384	61391	61393	61393	Dick	76	" An ye prepare so carefully , "
61395	61435	61393	61393	Dick	76	" I have here some papers that , for mine own sake , and the interest of those that trusted me , were better left behind than found upon my body . Where shall I conceal them , Will ? "
61436	61439	61441	61441	Lawless	132	" Nay , "
61443	61478	61441	61441	Lawless	132	" I will go forth into the wood and whistle me three verses of a song ; meanwhile , do you bury them where ye please , and smooth the sand upon the place . "
61479	61482	61484	61484	Richard	74	" Never ! "
61486	61503	61484	61484	Richard	74	" I trust you , man . I were base indeed if I not trusted you . "
61504	61513	61515	61517	the old outlaw	1743	" Brother , y are but a child , "
61533	61619	61522	61522	his	1743	" I am a kind old Christian , and no traitor to men s blood , and no sparer of mine own in a friend s jeopardy . But , fool , child , I am a thief by trade and birth and habit . If my bottle were empty and my mouth dry , I would rob you , dear child , as sure as I love , honour , and admire your parts and person ! Can it be clearer spoken ? No . "
61794	61807	61809	61810	the outlaw	1231	" Yet I would it were but summer and a clear day , "
61812	61876	61809	61810	the outlaw	1231	" that I might see myself in the mirror of a pool . There be many of Sir Daniel s men that know me ; and if we fell to be recognised , there might be two words for you , brother , but as for me , in a paternoster while , I should be kicking in a rope s - end . "
61941	61945	61946	61946	he	132	" Brother Martin , "
61962	61979	61980	61980	he	132	" let us enter and seek alms from these poor sinners . Pax vobiscum ! Ay , "
61988	62141	61980	61980	he	132	" tis as I feared ; I have somewhat lost the whine of it ; and by your leave , good Master Shelton , ye must suffer me to practise in these country places , before that I risk my fat neck by entering Sir Daniel s. But look ye a little , what an excellent thing it is to be a Jack - of - all - trades ! An I had not been a shipman , ye had infallibly gone down in the Good Hope ; an I had not been a thief , I could not have painted me your face ; and but that I had been a Grey Friar , and sung loud in the choir , and ate hearty at the board , I could not have carried this disguise , but the very dogs would have spied us out and barked at us for shams . "
62167	62170	62171	62171	he	1916	" Nay , "
62174	62201	62171	62171	he	1916	" better and better . We shall here try our false faces with a vengeance , and have a merry jest on Brother Capper to boot . "
62325	62332	62333	62333	he	166	" We want no beggars here ! "
62354	62358	62359	62359	he	166	" Not so , "
62362	62412	62359	62359	he	166	" We be strong men , and take ; these be weak , and crave ; but in the latter end these shall be uppermost and we below . Mind him not , my father ; but come , drink of my cup , and give me a benediction . "
62413	62427	62429	62430	the monk	1927	" Y are men of a light mind , carnal , and accursed , "
62432	62484	62429	62430	the monk	1927	" Now , may the saints forbid that ever I should drink with such companions ! But here , for the pity I bear to sinners , here I do leave you a blessed relic , the which , for your soul s interest , I bid you kiss and cherish . "
62563	62566	62567	62567	he	132	" So , "
62570	62592	62567	62567	he	132	" we have proved our false faces , Master Shelton . I will now adventure my poor carcase where ye please . "
62593	62596	62598	62598	Richard	74	" Good ! "
62600	62614	62598	62598	Richard	74	" It irks me to be doing . Set we on for Shoreby ! "
62617	62622	62567	62567	he	132	" IN MINE ENEMIES HOUSE "
63264	63274	63275	63275	he	76	" The taller of these twain was Lady Brackley , "
63278	63291	63275	63275	he	76	" and where Lady Brackley is , Joan will not be far . "
63554	63560	63562	63562	Dick	76	" It is right well , "
63564	63590	63562	63562	Dick	76	" Let me but know my Lady Brackley s chamber , and it will go hard an I find not Dame Hatch upon an errand . "
63664	63667	63669	63669	Dick	76	" Madam , "
63674	63704	63669	63669	Dick	76	" I cry you a thousand pardons ; but I have no eyes behind , and , by the mass , I could not tell ye were a maid . "
63754	63758	63759	63759	he	76	" Fair maid , "
63765	63786	63759	63759	he	76	" suffer me to kiss your hand , in token ye forgive my roughness , and I will even go . "
63787	63797	63799	63801	the young lady	2012	" Y are a strange monk , young sir , "
63813	63867	63799	63801	the young lady	2012	" and now that my first astonishment hath somewhat passed away , I can spy the layman in each word you utter . What do ye here ? Why are ye thus sacrilegiously tricked out ? Come ye in peace or war ? And why spy ye after Lady Brackley like a thief ? "
63868	63871	63759	63759	he	76	" Madam , "
63875	63979	63981	63981	Dick	76	" of one thing I pray you to be very sure : I am no thief . And even if I come here in war , as in some degree I do , I make no war upon fair maids , and I hereby entreat them to copy me so far , and to leave me be . For , indeed , fair mistress , cry out if such be your pleasure cry but once , and say what ye have seen , and the poor gentleman before you is merely a dead man . I can not think ye would be cruel , "
64003	64014	64016	64017	the maid	4055	" Are ye , then , a spy a Yorkist ? "
64019	64022	64023	64023	he	76	" Madam , "
64026	64092	64023	64023	he	76	" I am indeed a Yorkist , and , in some sort , a spy . But that which bringeth me into this house , the same which will win for me the pity and interest of your kind heart , is neither of York nor Lancaster . I will wholly put my life in your discretion . I am a lover , and my name "
64141	64144	64145	64145	she	2012	" Hush ! "
64148	64156	64145	64145	she	2012	" and come ! Shalt talk hereafter . "
64199	64202	64204	64206	the young lady	2012	" Now , "
64215	64285	64204	64206	the young lady	2012	" sit ye there and attend my sovereign good pleasure . I have life and death over you , and I will not scruple to abuse my power . Look to yourself ; y ave cruelly mauled my arm . He knew not I was a maid , quoth he ! Had he known I was a maid , he had ta en his belt to me , forsooth ! "
64315	64323	64324	64324	he	76	" Ta en my belt to her ! "
64327	64335	64324	64324	he	76	" Ta en my belt to her ! "
64551	64560	64561	64561	she	117	" What make ye here , good brother ? "
64564	64585	64540	64540	she	117	" Ye are doubtless ill - directed . Whom do ye require ? And she set her lamp upon the bracket .
64586	64589	64591	64591	Dick	76	" Joanna , "
64600	64603	64604	64604	he	76	" Joanna , "
64608	64626	64604	64604	he	76	" ye said ye loved me ; and the more fool I , but I believed it ! "
64627	64630	64631	64631	she	117	" Dick ! "
64634	64637	64631	64631	she	117	" Dick ! "
64678	64685	64686	64686	she	2030	" Oh , the fool fellow ! "
64689	64705	64706	64706	she	2030	" Oh , dear Dick ! Oh , if ye could see yourself ! Alack ! "
64711	64756	64706	64706	she	2030	" I have spoilt you , Dick ! I have knocked some of the paint off . But that can be mended . What can not be mended , Dick or I much fear it can not ! is my marriage with Lord Shoreby . "
64757	64764	64766	64767	the lad	309	" Is it decided , then ? "
64769	64784	64785	64785	she	2030	" To - morrow , before noon , Dick , in the abbey church , "
64788	64863	64785	64785	she	2030	" John Matcham and Joanna Sedley both shall come to a right miserable end . There is no help in tears , or I could weep mine eyes out . I have not spared myself to pray , but Heaven frowns on my petition . And , dear Dick good Dick but that ye can get me forth of this house before the morning , we must even kiss and say good - bye . "
64864	64867	64869	64869	Dick	76	" Nay , "
64871	64998	64869	64869	Dick	76	" not I ; I will never say that word . Tis like despair ; but while there s life , Joanna , there is hope . Yet will I hope . Ay , by the mass , and triumph ! Look ye , now , when ye were but a name to me , did I not follow did I not rouse good men did I not stake my life upon the quarrel ? And now that I have seen you for what ye are the fairest maid and stateliest of England think ye I would turn ? if the deep sea were there , I would straight through it ; if the way were full of lions , I would scatter them like mice . "
64999	65002	65003	65003	she	2032	" Ay , "
65008	65021	65003	65003	she	2032	" ye make a great ado about a sky - blue robe ! "
65022	65027	65029	65029	Dick	76	" Nay , Joan , "
65031	65071	65029	65029	Dick	76	" tis not alone the robe . But , lass , ye were disguised . Here am I disguised ; and , to the proof , do I not cut a figure of fun a right fool s figure ? "
65072	65082	65083	65083	she	2032	" Ay , Dick , an that ye do ! "
65088	65093	65094	65094	he	76	" Well , then ! "
65099	65127	65094	65094	he	76	" So was it with you , poor Matcham , in the forest . In sooth , ye were a wench to laugh at . But now ! "
65188	65191	65192	65192	she	2034	" Saints ! "
65195	65234	65192	65192	she	2034	" but what a noise ye keep ! Can ye not speak in compass ? And now , Joanna , my fair maid of the woods , what will ye give your gossip for bringing you your sweetheart ? "
65250	65256	65258	65260	the young lady	2012	" And you , sir , "
65262	65269	65258	65260	the young lady	2012	" what do ye give me ? "
65270	65273	65275	65275	Dick	76	" Madam , "
65277	65290	65275	65275	Dick	76	" I would fain offer to pay you in the same money . "
65291	65296	65298	65299	the lady	2036	" Come , then , "
65301	65307	65298	65299	the lady	2036	" it is permitted you . "
65321	65332	65333	65333	she	2036	" What ails ye at my face , fair sir ? "
65356	65359	65360	65360	she	2036	" Joanna , "
65363	65411	65412	65412	she	2036	" your sweetheart is very backward under your eyes ; but I warrant you , when first we met he was more ready . I am all black and blue , wench ; trust me never , if I be not black and blue ! And now , "
65415	65430	65412	65412	she	2036	" have ye said your sayings ? for I must speedily dismiss the paladin . "
65462	65466	65468	65470	the young lady	2012	" And supper ? "
65472	65481	65468	65470	the young lady	2012	" Must we not go down to supper ? "
65482	65489	65491	65491	Joan	117	" Nay , to be sure ! "
65493	65498	65491	65491	Joan	117	" I had forgotten . "
65499	65505	65507	65507	Dick	76	" Hide me , then , "
65509	65542	65543	65543	he	76	" put me behind the arras , shut me in a chest , or what ye will , so that I may be here on your return . Indeed , fair lady , "
65546	65575	65543	65543	he	76	" bear this in mind , that we are sore bested , and may never look upon each other s face from this night forward till we die . "
66003	66018	66096	66096	Lawless	132	" What make ye here , my merry men , among the greenwood shaws ? "
66023	66038	66096	66096	Lawless	132	" What make ye here ? Hey ! sots , what make ye here ? "
66058	66095	66096	66096	Lawless	132	" If ye should drink the clary wine , Fat Friar John , ye friend o mine If I should eat , and ye should drink , Who shall sing the mass , d ye think ? "
66328	66331	66332	66332	he	76	" Beast ! "
66334	66359	66332	66332	he	76	" beast and no man ! It is worse than treachery to be so witless . We may all be shent for thy sotting . "
66572	66577	66579	66579	Dick	76	" It is well , "
66584	66620	66579	66579	Dick	76	" they have not heard us , praise the saints ! But , now , what shall I do with this poor spy ? At least , I will take my tassel from his wallet . "
66866	66878	66879	66879	he	2075	" Nay , I will have the credit for mine order , "
66882	66897	66879	66879	he	2075	" My jolly boys must have the credit on t the credit , brother ; "
66923	66931	66913	66913	he	2075	" If ye should drink the clary wine "
66932	66937	66939	66939	Dick	76	" Peace , sot ! "
66949	67043	66939	66939	Dick	76	" In two words if so be that such a man can understand me who hath more wine than wit in him in two words , and , a - Mary s name , begone out of this house , where , if ye continue to abide , ye will not only hang yourself , but me also ! Faith , then , up foot ! be yare , or , by the mass , I may forget that I am in some sort your captain and in some your debtor ! Go ! "
67085	67090	67092	67092	Lawless	132	" By the mass , "
67094	67105	67092	67092	Lawless	132	" an I be not wanted , I can go ; "
67394	67398	67400	67401	Sir Daniel	72	" My lord , "
67403	67448	67400	67401	Sir Daniel	72	" have I not told you of this knave Black Arrow ? To the proof , behold it ! There it stands , and , by the rood , my gossip , in a man of yours , or one that stole your colours ! "
67449	67461	67463	67464	Lord Shoreby	143	" In good sooth , it was a man of mine , "
67469	67489	67463	67464	Lord Shoreby	143	" I would I had more such . He was keen as a beagle and secret as a mole . "
67490	67497	67499	67500	Sir Daniel	72	" Ay , gossip , truly ? "
67504	67526	67499	67500	Sir Daniel	72	" And what came he smelling up so many stairs in my poor mansion ? But he will smell no more . "
67527	67536	67538	67538	one	3600	" An t please you , Sir Daniel , "
67540	67556	67538	67538	one	3600	" here is a paper written upon with some matter , pinned upon his breast . "
67557	67566	67568	67569	the knight	438	" Give it me , arrow and all , "
67596	67599	67600	67600	he	438	" Ay , "
67607	67724	67600	67600	he	438	" here is a hate that followeth hard and close upon my heels . This black stick , or its just likeness , shall yet bring me down . And , gossip , suffer a plain knight to counsel you ; and if these hounds begin to wind you , flee ! Tis like a sickness it still hangeth , hangeth upon the limbs . But let us see what they have written . It is as I thought , my lord ; y are marked , like an old oak , by the woodman ; to - morrow or next day , by will come the axe . But what wrote ye in a letter ? "
67782	67785	67786	67786	he	143	" Gossip , "
67789	67846	67786	67786	he	143	" I have indeed lost a letter here that much imported ; and could I lay my hand upon the knave that took it , he should incontinently grace a halter . But let us , first of all , secure the issues of the house . Here is enough harm already , by St. George ! "
68020	68027	68028	68028	she	117	" It will avail but little , "
68031	68048	68028	68028	she	117	" I shall be we d to - morrow , in the morning , after all ! "
68049	68052	68054	68055	her friend	2121	" What ! "
68057	68100	68054	68055	her friend	2121	" And here is our paladin that driveth lions like mice ! Ye have little faith , of a surety . But come , friend lion - driver , give us some comfort ; speak , and let us hear bold counsels . "
68124	68127	68129	68129	he	76	" Truly , "
68131	68174	68129	68129	he	76	" we are in straits . Yet , could I but win out of this house for half an hour , I do honestly tell myself that all might still go well ; and for the marriage , it should be prevented . "
68175	68181	68183	68184	the girl	1127	" And for the lions , "
68186	68192	68183	68184	the girl	1127	" they shall be driven . "
68193	68199	68201	68201	Dick	76	" I crave your excuse , "
68203	68253	68201	68201	Dick	76	" I speak not now in any boasting humour , but rather as one inquiring after help or counsel ; for if I get not forth of this house and through these sentinels , I can do less than naught . Take me , I pray you , rightly . "
68254	68264	68265	68266	the girl	1127	" Why said ye he was rustic , Joan ? "
68269	68297	68265	68266	the girl	1127	" I warrant he hath a tongue in his head ; ready , soft , and bold is his speech at pleasure . What would ye more ? "
68298	68301	68303	68303	Joanna	117	" Nay , "
68309	68354	68303	68303	Joanna	117	" they have changed me my friend Dick , tis sure enough . When I beheld him , he was rough indeed . But it matters little ; there is no help for my hard case , and I must still be Lady Shoreby ! "
68355	68360	68362	68362	Dick	76	" Nay , then , "
68364	68410	68362	68362	Dick	76	" I will even make the adventure . A friar is not much regarded ; and if I found a good fairy to lead me up , I may find another belike to carry me down . How call they the name of this spy ? "
68411	68414	68416	68418	the young lady	2012	" Rutter , "
68420	68448	68416	68418	the young lady	2012	" and an excellent good name to call him by . But how mean ye , lion - driver ? What is in your mind to do ? "
68449	68457	68459	68459	Dick	76	" To offer boldly to go forth , "
68461	68494	68459	68459	Dick	76	" and if any stop me , to keep an unchanged countenance , and say I go to pray for Rutter . They will be praying over his poor clay even now . "
68495	68502	68504	68505	the girl	1127	" The device is somewhat simple , "
68507	68513	68504	68505	the girl	1127	" yet it may hold . "
68514	68517	68519	68520	young Shelton	74	" Nay , "
68522	68540	68519	68520	young Shelton	74	" it is no device , but mere boldness , which serveth often better in great straits . "
68541	68546	68547	68547	she	2012	" Ye say true , "
68550	68602	68547	68547	she	2012	" Well , go , a - Mary s name , and may Heaven speed you ! Ye leave here a poor maid that loves you entirely , and another that is most heartily your friend . Be wary , for their sakes , and make not shipwreck of your safety . "
68603	68606	68608	68608	Joanna	117	" Ay , "
68610	68641	68608	68608	Joanna	117	" go , Dick . Ye run no more peril , whether ye go or stay . Go ; ye take my heart with you ; the saints defend you ! "
68678	68682	68684	68684	Dick	76	" Pax vobiscum , "
68686	68699	68684	68684	Dick	76	" I go to pray over the body of this poor Rutter . "
68700	68704	68706	68707	the sentry	1236	" Like enough , "
68709	68719	68720	68720	He	1236	" but to go alone is not permitted you . "
68730	68734	68735	68735	he	1236	" One cometh ! "
68787	68796	68797	68797	he	1236	" Let him not slip , my lads , "
68800	68811	68797	68797	he	1236	" Bring him to Sir Oliver , on your lives ! "
69127	69131	69133	69134	Sir Oliver	73	" A monk ! "
69150	69161	69162	69162	he	73	" My brother , I looked not for your coming , "
69170	69191	69162	69162	he	73	" In all civility , who are ye ? and at whose instance do ye join your supplications to ours ? "
69227	69238	69239	69239	he	73	" I can not hope to deceive you , sir , "
69242	69250	69239	69239	he	73	" My life is in your hands . "
69270	69273	69274	69274	he	73	" Richard , "
69277	69382	69274	69274	he	73	" what brings you here , I know not ; but I much misdoubt it to be evil . Nevertheless , for the kindness that was , I would not willingly deliver you to harm . Ye shall sit all night beside me in the stalls : ye shall sit there till my Lord of Shoreby be married , and the party gone safe home ; and if all goeth well , and ye have planned no evil , in the end ye shall go whither ye will . But if your purpose be bloody , it shall return upon your head . Amen ! "
69710	69713	69714	69714	he	73	" Richard , "
69717	69769	69714	69714	he	73	" my son , if ye mean me evil , I will certify , on my soul s welfare , ye design upon an innocent man . Sinful in the eye of Heaven I do declare myself ; but sinful as against you I am not , neither have been ever . "
69770	69774	69776	69776	Dick	76	" My father , "
69785	69810	69776	69776	Dick	76	" trust me , I design nothing ; but as for your innocence , I may not forget that ye cleared yourself but lamely . "
69811	69819	69821	69822	the priest	338	" A man may be innocently guilty , "
69824	69872	69821	69822	the priest	338	" He may be set blindfolded upon a mission , ignorant of its true scope . So it was with me . I did decoy your father to his death ; but as Heaven sees us in this sacred place , I knew not what I did . "
69873	69878	69880	69880	Dick	76	" It may be , "
69882	69973	69880	69880	Dick	76	" But see what a strange web ye have woven , that I should be , at this hour , at once your prisoner and your judge ; that ye should both threaten my days and deprecate my anger . Methinks , if ye had been all your life a true man and good priest , ye would neither thus fear nor thus detest me . And now to your prayers . I do obey you , since needs must ; but I will not be burthened with your company . "
70475	70479	70481	70481	Dick	76	" Move not , "
70483	70536	70481	70481	Dick	76	" We are in the plaguiest pass , thanks , before all things , to thy swinishness of yestereven . When ye saw me here , so strangely seated where I have neither right nor interest , what a murrain I could ye not smell harm and get ye gone from evil ? "
70537	70540	70542	70542	Lawless	132	" Nay , "
70544	70559	70542	70542	Lawless	132	" I thought ye had heard from Ellis , and were here on duty . "
70560	70563	70565	70565	Dick	76	" Ellis ! "
70567	70574	70565	70565	Dick	76	" Is Ellis , then , returned ?
70575	70579	70581	70582	the outlaw	1231	" For sure , "
70584	70644	70581	70582	the outlaw	1231	" He came last night , and belted me sore for being in wine so there ye are avenged , my master . A furious man is Ellis Duckworth ! He hath ridden me hot - spur from Craven to prevent this marriage ; and , Master Dick , ye know the way of him do so he will ! "
70645	70650	70652	70652	Dick	76	" Nay , then , "
70657	70728	70652	70652	Dick	76	" you and I , my poor brother , are dead men ; for I sit here a prisoner upon suspicion , and my neck was to answer for this very marriage that he purposeth to mar . I had a fair choice , by the rood ! to lose my sweetheart or else lose my life ! Well , the cast is thrown it is to be my life . "
70729	70734	70736	70736	Lawless	132	" By the mass , "
70741	70746	70736	70736	Lawless	132	" I am gone ! "
70758	70766	70767	70767	he	76	" Friend Lawless , sit ye still , "
70770	70846	70767	70767	he	76	" An ye have eyes , look yonder at the corner by the chancel arch ; see ye not that , even upon the motion of your rising , yon armed men are up and ready to intercept you ? Yield ye , friend . Ye were bold aboard ship , when ye thought to die a sea - death ; be bold again , now that y are to die presently upon the gallows . "
70847	70851	70853	70853	Lawless	132	" Master Dick , "
70855	70895	70853	70853	Lawless	132	" the thing hath come upon me somewhat of the suddenest . But give me a moment till I fetch my breath again ; and , by the mass , I will be as stout - hearted as yourself . "
70896	70903	70905	70905	Dick	76	" Here is my bold fellow ! "
70907	70933	70905	70905	Dick	76	" And yet , Lawless , it goes hard against the grain with me to die ; but where whining mendeth nothing , wherefore whine ? "
70934	70940	70942	70942	Lawless	132	" Nay , that indeed ! "
70944	70995	70942	70942	Lawless	132	" And a fig for death , at worst ! It has to be done , my master , soon or late . And hanging in a good quarrel is an easy death , they say , though I could never hear of any that came back to say so . "
71029	71037	71038	71038	Dick	76	" And for the matter of that , "
71041	71081	71038	71038	Dick	76	" it is yet our best chance to keep quiet . We wot not yet what Duckworth purposes ; and when all is said , and if the worst befall , we may yet clear our feet of it . "
71827	71830	71831	71831	he	73	" Here , "
71834	71872	71831	71831	he	73	" is Richard Shelton alas the hour ! blood guilty ! Seize him ! bid him be seized ! For all our lives sakes , take him and bind him surely ! He hath sworn our fall . "
71891	71894	71895	71895	he	72	" Where ? "
71898	71916	71895	71895	he	72	" Hale him forth ! By the cross of Holywood , but he shall rue this hour ! "
71987	71990	71991	71991	he	72	" Ay , "
71994	72036	72037	72037	he	72	" treacherous and insolent , I have thee fast ; and by all potent oaths , for every drop of blood that now trickles in mine eyes , I will wring a groan out of thy carcase . Away with him ! "
72040	72065	72037	72037	he	72	" Here is no place ! Off with him to my house . I will number every joint of thy body with a torture . "
72078	72081	72082	72082	he	76	" Sanctuary ! "
72085	72103	72082	72082	he	76	" Sanctuary ! Ho , there , my fathers ! They would drag me from the church ! "
72104	72116	72118	72123	a tall man , magnificently dressed	2252	" From the church thou hast defiled with murder , boy , "
72125	72130	72132	72132	Dick	76	" On what probation ? "
72134	72217	72132	72132	Dick	76	" They do accuse me , indeed , of some complicity , but have not proved one tittle . I was , in truth , a suitor for this damsel s hand ; and she , I will be bold to say it , repaid my suit with favour . But what then ? To love a maid is no offence , I trow nay , nor to gain her love . In all else , I stand here free from guiltiness . "
72393	72397	72398	72398	he	2263	" Search them , "
72401	72413	72398	72398	he	2263	" for arms . We may so judge of their intentions . "
72506	72512	72514	72516	the tall man	2268	" How say ye now ? "
72523	72526	72528	72528	Dick	76	" Sir , "
72530	72721	72528	72528	Dick	76	" I am here in sanctuary , is it not so ? Well , sir , I see by your bearing that ye are high in station , and I read in your countenance the marks of piety and justice . To you , then , I will yield me prisoner , and that blithely , foregoing the advantage of this holy place . But rather than to be yielded into the discretion of that man whom I do here accuse with a loud voice to be the murderer of my natural father and the unjust retainer of my lands and revenues rather than that , I would beseech you , under favour , with your own gentle hand , to despatch me on the spot . Your own ears have heard him , how before that I was proven guilty he did threaten me with torments . It standeth not with your own honour to deliver me to my sworn enemy and old oppressor , but to try me fairly by the way of law , and , if that I be guilty indeed , to slay me mercifully . "
72722	72726	72728	72729	Sir Daniel	72	" My lord , "
72731	72751	72728	72729	Sir Daniel	72	" ye will not hearken to this wolf ? His bloody dagger reeks him the lie into his face . "
72752	72762	72764	72766	the tall stranger	2270	" Nay , but suffer me , good knight , "
72768	72778	72764	72766	the tall stranger	2270	" your own vehemence doth somewhat tell against yourself . "
72818	72824	72825	72825	she	2224	" My Lord of Risingham , "
72828	73010	72825	72825	she	2224	" hear me , in justice . I am here in this man s custody by mere force , reft from mine own people . Since that day I had never pity , countenance , nor comfort from the face of man but from him only Richard Shelton whom they now accuse and labour to undo . My lord , if he was yesternight in Sir Daniel s mansion , it was I that brought him there ; he came but at my prayer , and thought to do no hurt . While yet Sir Daniel was a good lord to him , he fought with them of the Black Arrow loyally ; but when his foul guardian sought his life by practices , and he fled by night , for his soul s sake , out of that bloody house , whither was he to turn he , helpless and penniless ? Or if he be fallen among ill company , whom should ye blame the lad that was unjustly handled , or the guardian that did abuse his trust ? "
73026	73037	73038	73038	she	2034	" And I , my good lord and natural uncle , "
73041	73079	73038	73038	she	2034	" I can bear testimony , on my conscience and before the face of all , that what this maiden saith is true . It was I , unworthy , that did lead the young man in . "
73133	73137	73138	73138	he	139	" Sir Daniel , "
73141	73216	73138	73138	he	139	" here is a right intricate affair , the which , with your good leave , it shall be mine to examine and adjust . Content ye , then ; your business is in careful hands ; justice shall be done you ; and in the meanwhile , get ye incontinently home , and have your hurts attended . The air is shrewd , and I would not ye took cold upon these scratches . "
73351	73361	73332	73333	the bridesmaid	2285	" Keep your heart up , lion - driver ! "
73465	73472	73474	73475	the outlaw	1231	" Well spoken , Master Richard , "
73477	73522	73474	73475	the outlaw	1231	" it was excellently well spoken , and , for my part , I thank you cordially . Here we are in good hands ; we shall be justly tried , and , some time this evening , decently hanged on the same tree . "
73523	73535	73537	73537	Dick	76	" Indeed , my poor friend , I do believe it , "
73539	73549	73551	73551	Lawless	132	" Yet have we a string to our bow , "
73553	73602	73551	73551	Lawless	132	" Ellis Duckworth is a man out of ten thousand ; he holdeth you right near his heart , both for your own and for your father s sake ; and knowing you guiltless of this fact , he will stir earth and heaven to bear you clear . "
73603	73609	73611	73611	Dick	76	" It may not be , "
73613	73663	73611	73611	Dick	76	" What can he do ? He hath but a handful . Alack , if it were but to - morrow could I but keep a certain tryst an hour before noon to - morrow all were , I think , otherwise . But now there is no help . "
73664	73667	73669	73669	Lawless	132	" Well , "
73671	73716	73669	73669	Lawless	132	" an ye will stand to it for my innocence , I will stand to it for yours , and that stoutly . It shall naught avail us ; but an I be to hang , it shall not be for lack of swearing . "
73827	73830	73831	73831	he	1897	" Sir , "
73834	73926	73831	73831	he	1897	" I knew your father , who was a man of honour , and this inclineth me to be the more lenient ; but I may not hide from you that heavy charges lie against your character . Ye do consort with murderers and robbers ; upon a clear probation ye have carried war against the king s peace ; ye are suspected to have piratically seized upon a ship ; ye are found skulking with a counterfeit presentment in your enemy s house ; a man is slain that very evening "
73927	73936	73937	73937	Dick	76	" An it like you , my lord , "
73940	73964	73937	73937	Dick	76	" I will at once avow my guilt , such as it is . I slew this fellow Rutter ; and to the proof "
73969	73978	73831	73831	he	1897	" here is a letter from his wallet . "
73992	73998	73999	73999	he	184	" Ye have read this ? "
74002	74008	74010	74010	Dick	76	" I have read it , "
74012	74020	74021	74022	the earl	2300	" Are ye for York or Lancaster ? "
74025	74051	74053	74053	Dick	76	" My lord , it was but a little while back that I was asked that question , and knew not how to answer it , "
74055	74074	74053	74053	Dick	76	" but having answered once , I will not vary . My lord , I am for York . "
74080	74084	74085	74085	he	2300	" Honestly replied , "
74088	74099	74085	74085	he	2300	" But wherefore , then , deliver me this letter ? "
74100	74116	74118	74118	Dick	76	" Nay , but against traitors , my lord , are not all sides arrayed ? "
74120	74129	74131	74132	the earl	2300	" I would they were , young gentleman , "
74134	74266	74131	74132	the earl	2300	" and I do at least approve your saying . There is more youth than guile in you , I do perceive ; and were not Sir Daniel a mighty man upon our side , I were half - tempted to espouse your quarrel . For I have inquired , and it appears ye have been hardly dealt with , and have much excuse . But look ye , sir , I am , before all else , a leader in the queen s interest ; and though by nature a just man , as I believe , and leaning even to the excess of mercy , yet must I order my goings for my party s interest , and , to keep Sir Daniel , I would go far about . "
74267	74271	74273	74273	Dick	76	" My lord , "
74275	74304	74273	74273	Dick	76	" ye will think me very bold to counsel you ; but do ye count upon Sir Daniel s faith ? Methought he had changed sides intolerably often . "
74305	74320	74321	74322	the earl	2300	" Nay , it is the way of England . What would ye have ? "
74325	74367	74321	74322	the earl	2300	" But ye are unjust to the knight of Tunstall ; and as faith goes , in this unfaithful generation , he hath of late been honourably true to us of Lancaster . Even in our last reverses he stood firm . "
74368	74376	74378	74378	Dick	76	" An it pleased you , then , "
74380	74398	74400	74400	he	76	" to cast your eye upon this letter , ye might somewhat change your thought of him ; "
74444	74451	74452	74452	he	76	" Ye have read this also ? "
74455	74459	74461	74461	Dick	76	" Even so , "
74463	74477	74461	74461	Dick	76	" It is your lordship s own estate he offers to Lord Wensleydale ? "
74478	74490	74492	74493	the earl	2300	" It is my own estate , even as ye say ! "
74495	74588	74492	74493	the earl	2300	" I am your bedesman for this letter . It hath shown me a fox s hole . Command me , Master Shelton ; I will not be backward in gratitude , and to begin with , York or Lancaster , true man or thief , I do now set you at freedom . Go , a Mary s name ! But judge it right that I retain and hang your fellow , Lawless . The crime hath been most open , and it were fitting that some open punishment should follow . "
74589	74606	74608	74608	Dick	76	" My lord , I make it my first suit to you to spare him also , "
74610	74627	74629	74630	the earl	2300	" It is an old , condemned rogue , thief , and vagabond , Master Shelton , "
74632	74668	74629	74630	the earl	2300	" He hath been gallows - ripe this score of years . And , whether for one thing or another , whether to - morrow or the day after , where is the great choice ? "
74669	74686	74688	74688	Dick	76	" Yet , my lord , it was through love to me that he came hither , "
74690	74701	74688	74688	Dick	76	" and I were churlish and thankless to desert him . "
74702	74710	74712	74713	the earl	2300	" Master Shelton , ye are troublesome , "
74717	74782	74712	74713	the earl	2300	" It is an evil way to prosper in this world . Howbeit , and to be quit of your importunity , I will once more humour you . Go , then , together ; but go warily , and get swiftly out of Shoreby town . For this Sir Daniel whom may the saints confound ! thirsteth most greedily to have your blood . "
74783	74811	74813	74813	Dick	76	" My lord , I do now offer you in words my gratitude , trusting at some brief date to pay you some of it in service , "
74966	74977	74978	74978	Dick	76	" How if we lay there until the night fall ? "
75364	75377	75378	75378	he	2340	" Seven pieces of as good Gascony as ever a tapster broached , "
75382	75406	75378	75378	he	2340	" the best ship out o the port o Dartmouth , a Virgin Mary parcel - gilt , thirteen pounds of good gold money "
75407	75415	75417	75420	one of the others	2342	" I have bad losses , too , "
75422	75451	75417	75420	one of the others	2342	" I have had losses of mine own , gossip Arblaster . I was robbed at Martinmas of five shillings and a leather wallet well worth ninepence farthing . "
75607	75612	75613	75613	he	2348	" Hey , shipmates ! "
75616	75767	75613	75613	he	2348	" Have ye ever a penny pie for a poor old shipman , clean destroyed by pirates ? I am a man that would have paid for you both o Thursday morning ; and now here I be , o Saturday night , begging for a flagon of ale ! Ask my man Tom , if ye misdoubt me . Seven pieces of good Gascon wine , a ship that was mine own , and was my father s before me , a Blessed Mary of plane - tree wood and parcel - gilt , and thirteen pounds in gold and silver . Hey ! what say ye ? A man that fought the French , too ; for I have fought the French ; I have cut more French throats upon the high seas than ever a man that sails out of Dartmouth . Come , a penny piece . "
75806	75813	75815	75816	the skipper	1580	" Are ye dumb , boy ? "
75818	75821	75822	75822	he	1580	" Mates , "
75829	75868	75822	75822	he	1580	" they be dumb . I like not this manner of discourtesy ; for an a man be dumb , so be as he s courteous , he will still speak when he was spoken to , methinks . "
76114	76129	76131	76131	Arblaster	173	" Bring me him back into the alehouse , till I see his face , "
76133	76138	76140	76140	Tom	136	" Nay , nay , "
76142	76158	76140	76140	Tom	136	" but let us first unload his wallet , lest the other lads cry share . "
76192	76200	76202	76203	the skipper	1580	" Turn me him to the moon , "
76221	76225	76226	76226	he	1580	" Blessed Virgin ! "
76229	76235	76226	76226	he	1580	" it is the pirate ! "
76236	76239	76241	76241	Tom	136	" Hey ! "
76243	76256	76258	76258	Arblaster	173	" By the Virgin of Bordeaux , it is the man himself ! "
76260	76272	76273	76273	he	173	" What , sea - thief , do I hold you ? "
76276	76344	76273	76273	he	173	" Where is my ship ? Where is my wine ? Hey ! have I you in my hands ? Tom , give me one end of a cord here ; I will so truss me this sea - thief , hand and foot together , like a basting turkey marry , I will so bind him up and thereafter I will so beat so beat him ! "
76566	76570	76571	76571	he	309	" My masters , "
76574	76665	76571	76571	he	309	" are ye gone clean foolish ? Here hath Heaven put into your hands as pretty an occasion to grow rich as ever shipman had such as ye might make thirty over - sea adventures and not find again and , by the mass I what do ye ? Beat me ? nay ; so would an angry child ! But for long - headed tarry - Johns , that fear not fire nor water , and that love gold as they love beef , methinks ye are not wise . "
76666	76669	76671	76671	Tom	136	" Ay , "
76673	76683	76671	76671	Tom	136	" now y are trussed ye would cozen us . "
76684	76688	76690	76690	Dick	76	" Cozen you ! "
76692	76798	76690	76690	Dick	76	" Nay , if ye be fools , it would be easy . But if ye be shrewd fellows , as I trow ye are , ye can see plainly where your interest lies . When I took your ship from you , we were many , we were well clad and armed ; but now , bethink you a little , who mustered that array ? One incontestably that hath much gold . And if he , being already rich , continueth to hunt after more even in the face of storms bethink you once more shall there not be a treasure somewhere hidden ? "
76799	76804	76806	76809	one of the men	693	" What meaneth he ? "
76811	76829	76831	76831	Dick	76	" Why , if ye have lost an old skiff and a few jugs of vinegary wine , "
76833	76908	76831	76831	Dick	76	" forget them , for the trash they are ; and do ye rather buckle to an adventure worth the name , that shall , in twelve hours , make or mar you for ever . But take me up from where I lie , and let us go somewhere near at hand and talk across a flagon , for I am sore and frozen , and my mouth is half among the snow . "
76909	76917	76919	76919	Tom	136	" He seeks but to cozen us , "
76923	76928	76930	76932	the third man	2361	" Cozen ! cozen ! "
76934	77008	76930	76932	the third man	2361	" I would I could see the man that could cozen me ! He were a cozener indeed ! Nay , I was not born yesterday . I can see a church when it hath a steeple on it ; and for my part , gossip Arblaster , methinks there is some sense in this young man . Shall we go hear him , indeed ? Say , shall we go hear him ? "
77009	77025	77027	77027	Arblaster	173	" I would look gladly on a pottle of strong ale , good Master Pirret , "
77029	77043	77027	77027	Arblaster	173	" How say ye , Tom ? But then the wallet is empty . "
77044	77049	77051	77052	the other	311	" I will pay , "
77053	77080	77051	77052	the other	311	" I will pay . I would fain see this matter out ; I do believe , upon my conscience , there is gold in it . "
77081	77095	77097	77097	Tom	136	" Nay , if ye get again to drinking , all is lost ! "
77099	77113	77115	77116	Master Pirret	197	" Gossip Arblaster , ye suffer your fellow to have too much liberty , "
77118	77132	77115	77116	Master Pirret	197	" Would ye be led by a hired man ? Fy , fy ! "
77133	77138	77140	77140	Arblaster	173	" Peace , fellow ! "
77145	77167	77140	77140	Arblaster	173	" Will ye put your oar in ? Truly a fine pass , when the crew is to correct the skipper ! "
77168	77177	77179	77179	Tom	136	" Well , then , go your way , "
77181	77189	77179	77179	Tom	136	" I wash my hands of you . "
77190	77200	77202	77203	Master Pirret	197	" Set him , then , upon his feet , "
77205	77218	77202	77203	Master Pirret	197	" I know a privy place where we may drink and discourse . "
77219	77237	77239	77239	Dick	76	" If I am to walk , my friends , ye must set my feet at liberty , "
77253	77258	77260	77260	Pirret	197	" He saith true , "
77262	77288	77260	77260	Pirret	197	" Truly , he could not walk accoutred as he is . Give it a slit out with your knife and slit it , gossip . "
77557	77564	77566	77566	Pirret	197	" And now , young man , "
77568	77615	77566	77566	Pirret	197	" to your tale . It doth appear , indeed , that ye have somewhat abused our gossip Arblaster ; but what then ? Make it up to him show him but this chance to become wealthy and I will go pledge he will forgive you . "
77895	77899	77901	77901	Pirret	197	" And so , "
77903	77910	77901	77901	Pirret	197	" y are one of these ? "
77911	77917	77919	77919	Dick	76	" I was made so , "
77921	78027	77919	77919	Dick	76	" against my will ; but an I could but get a sack or two of gold coin to my share , I should be a fool indeed to continue dwelling in a filthy cave , and standing shot and buffet like a soldier . Here be we four ; good ! Let us , then , go forth into the forest to - morrow ere the sun be up . Could we come honestly by a donkey , it were better ; but an we can not , we have our four strong backs , and I warrant me we shall come home staggering . "
78033	78038	78039	78039	he	197	" And this magic , "
78041	78057	78039	78039	he	197	" this password , whereby the cave is opened how call ye it , friend ? "
78058	78070	78072	78072	Dick	76	" Nay , none know the word but the three chiefs , "
78074	78117	78072	78072	Dick	76	" but here is your great good fortune , that , on this very evening , I should be the bearer of a spell to open it . It is a thing not trusted twice a year beyond the captain s wallet . "
78118	78122	78124	78124	Arblaster	173	" A spell ! "
78137	78157	78124	78124	Arblaster	173	" Aroint thee ! no spells ! I be a good Christian . Ask my man Tom , else . "
78158	78167	78169	78169	Dick	76	" Nay , but this is white magic , "
78171	78190	78169	78169	Dick	76	" It doth naught with the devil ; only the powers of numbers , herbs , and planets . "
78191	78196	78198	78198	Pirret	197	" Ay , ay , "
78200	78233	78198	78198	Pirret	197	" tis but white magic , gossip . There is no sin therein , I do assure you . But proceed , good youth . This spell in what should it consist ? "
78234	78244	78246	78246	Dick	76	" Nay , that I will incontinently show you , "
78248	78303	78246	78246	Dick	76	" Have ye there the ring ye took from my finger ? Good ! Now hold it forth before you by the extreme finger - ends , at the arm s - length , and over against the shining of these embers . Tis so exactly . Thus , then , is the spell . "
79501	79512	79514	79514	Richard	74	" Hold ye well , sir ! Here is help ! "
79531	79540	79541	79541	he	2452	" To the Arrow ! to the Arrow ! "
79899	79905	79921	79921	he	2469	" Seize me these fellows ! "
79995	79998	80000	80001	this lad	3775	" Sir , "
80003	80017	80000	80001	this lad	3775	" ye came in good time for me , and none too early . "
80018	80022	80024	80024	Dick	76	" My lord , "
80041	80079	80031	80031	he	76	" ye are yourself so marvellous a good swordsman that I believe ye had managed them single - handed . Howbeit , it was certainly well for me that your men delayed no longer than they did . "
80080	80088	80090	80091	the stranger	1456	" How knew ye who I was ? "
80093	80100	80101	80101	Dick	76	" Even now , my lord , "
80104	80114	80101	80101	Dick	76	" I am ignorant of whom I speak with . "
80115	80120	80122	80123	the other	311	" Is it so ? "
80125	80138	80122	80123	the other	311	" And yet ye threw yourself head first into this unequal battle . "
80139	80149	80151	80151	Dick	76	" I saw one man valiantly contending against many , "
80153	80166	80151	80151	Dick	76	" and I had thought myself dishonoured not to bear him aid . "
80182	80200	80178	80178	he	2476	" These are very brave words . But to the more essential are ye Lancaster or York ? "
80201	80216	80217	80217	Dick	76	" My lord , I make no secret ; I am clear for York , "
80220	80225	80227	80228	the other	311	" By the mass ! "
80230	80237	80227	80228	the other	311	" it is well for you . "
80250	80255	80256	80256	he	2476	" Let me see , "
80266	80283	80256	80256	he	2476	" let me see a clean end of these brave gentlemen . Truss me them up . "
80364	80368	80370	80372	the deformed leader	2484	" And now , "
80374	80392	80370	80372	the deformed leader	2484	" back to your posts , and when I summon you next , be readier to attend . "
80393	80398	80400	80401	one man	990	" My lord duke , "
80403	80422	80400	80401	one man	990	" beseech you , tarry not here alone . Keep but a handful of lances at your hand . "
80423	80426	80428	80429	the duke	3689	" Fellow , "
80431	80500	80428	80429	the duke	3689	" I have forborne to chide you for your slowness . Cross me not , therefore . I trust my hand and arm , for all that I be crooked . Ye were backward when the trumpet sounded ; and ye are now too forward with your counsels . But it is ever so ; last with the lance and first with tongue . Let it be reversed . "
80598	80601	80603	80604	the duke	3689	" Here , "
80606	80666	80603	80604	the duke	3689	" ye have seen my vengeance , which is , like my blade , both sharp and ready . But I would not have you , for all Christendom , suppose me thankless . You that came to my aid with a good sword and a better courage unless that ye recoil from my misshapenness come to my heart . "
80734	80742	80743	80743	he	1637	" And now , my lord duke , "
80753	80767	80743	80743	he	1637	" do I suppose aright ? Are ye my Lord Duke of Gloucester ? "
80768	80775	80777	80778	the other	311	" I am Richard of Gloucester , "
80780	80788	80777	80778	the other	311	" And you how call they you ? "
80808	80814	80815	80815	he	76	" Ye come too soon , "
80818	80934	80815	80815	he	76	" but why should I complain ? Ye are like me , that was here at watch two hours before the day . But this is the first sally of mine arms ; upon this adventure , Master Shelton , shall I make or mar the quality of my renown . There lie mine enemies , under two old , skilled captains Risingham and Brackley well posted for strength , I do believe , but yet upon two sides without retreat , enclosed betwixt the sea , the harbour , and the river . Methinks , Shelton , here were a great blow to be stricken , an we could strike it silently and suddenly . "
80935	80943	80945	80945	Dick	76	" I do think so , indeed , "
80949	80958	80960	80961	the duke	3689	" Have ye my Lord Foxham s notes ? "
80995	81006	81007	81007	he	76	" And for mine own part , my lord duke , "
81010	81088	81007	81007	he	76	" an ye had men enough , I would fall on even at this present . For , look ye , at the peep of day the watches of the night are over ; but by day they keep neither watch nor ward only scour the outskirts with horsemen . Now , then , when the night watch is already unarmed , and the rest are at their morning cup now were the time to break them . "
81089	81096	81098	81098	Gloucester	201	" How many do ye count ? "
81100	81107	81108	81108	Dick	76	" They number not two thousand , "
81111	81122	81124	81125	the duke	3689	" I have seven hundred in the woods behind us , "
81127	81177	81124	81125	the duke	3689	" seven hundred follow from Kettley , and will be here anon ; behind these , and further , are four hundred more ; and my Lord Foxham hath five hundred half a day from here , at Holywood . Shall we attend their coming , or fall on ? "
81178	81182	81184	81184	Dick	76	" My lord , "
81186	81257	81184	81184	Dick	76	" when ye hanged these five poor rogues ye did decide the question . Churls although they were , in these uneasy , times they will be lacked and looked for , and the alarm be given . Therefore , my lord , if ye do count upon the advantage of a surprise , ye have not , in my poor opinion , one whole hour in front of you . "
81258	81265	81267	81267	Crookback	199	" I do think so indeed , "
81269	81322	81267	81267	Crookback	199	" Well , before an hour , ye shall be in the thick on t , winning spurs . A swift man to Holywood , carrying Lord Foxham s signet ; another along the road to speed my laggards ! Nay , Shelton , by the rood , it may be done ! "
81685	81691	81692	81692	he	202	" In that poor place , "
81695	81784	81692	81692	he	202	" where people are cooking breakfast , either you shall gain your spurs and I begin a life of mighty honour and glory in the world s eye , or both of us , as I conceive it , shall fall dead and be unheard of . Two Richards are we . Well , then , Richard Shelton , they shall be heard about , these two ! Their swords shall not ring more loudly on men s helmets than their names shall ring in people s ears . "
82583	82586	82587	82587	he	76	" Go , "
82590	82623	82624	82624	he	76	" win your spurs . Win glory for me : one Richard for another . I tell you , if I rise , ye shall rise by the same ladder . Go , "
82653	82663	82664	82664	he	76	" Go , Dutton , and that right speedily , "
82667	82719	82664	82664	he	76	" Follow that lad . If ye find him faithful , ye answer for his safety , a head for a head . Woe unto you , if ye return without him ! But if he be faithless or , for one instant , ye misdoubt him stab him from behind . "
83216	83225	83227	83228	the page	2600	" It is from my Lord of Gloucester , "
83230	83243	83227	83228	the page	2600	" He hath observed , Sir Richard , that ye went unarmed . "
84060	84065	84066	84066	he	202	" Despatch these horses , "
84069	84080	84081	84081	he	202	" they keep you from your vantage . Richard Shelton , "
84084	84092	84081	84081	he	202	" ye have pleased me . Kneel . "
84136	84143	84144	84144	he	202	" And now , Sir Richard , "
84147	84197	84198	84198	he	202	" if that ye see Lord Risingham , send me an express upon the instant . Were it your last man , let me hear of it incontinently . I had rather venture the post than lose my stroke at him . For mark me , all of ye , "
84205	84224	84202	84202	his	202	" if Earl Risingham fall by another hand than mine , I shall count this victory a defeat . "
84225	84230	84232	84235	one of his attendants	2653	" My lord duke , "
84237	84255	84232	84235	one of his attendants	2653	" is your grace not weary of exposing his dear life unneedfully ? Why tarry we here ? "
84256	84259	84261	84262	the duke	3689	" Catesby , "
84264	84390	84261	84262	the duke	3689	" here is the battle , not elsewhere . The rest are but feigned onslaughts . Here must we vanquish . And for the exposure if ye were an ugly hunchback , and the children gecked at you upon the street , ye would count your body cheaper , and an hour of glory worth a life . Howbeit , if ye will , let us ride on and visit the other posts . Sir Richard here , my namesake , he shall still hold this entry , where he wadeth to the ankles in hot blood . Him can we trust . But mark it , Sir Richard , ye are not yet done . The worst is yet to ward . Sleep not . "
84755	84761	84762	84762	he	76	" It was well fought , "
84765	84779	84762	84762	he	76	" and , by my sooth , they will not charge us twice . "
84780	84783	84785	84787	the little archer	2677	" Sir , "
84789	84889	84785	84787	the little archer	2677	" ye have fought right well for York , and better for yourself . Never hath man in so brief space prevailed so greatly on the duke s affections . That he should have entrusted such a post to one he knew not is a marvel . But look to your head , Sir Richard ! If ye be vanquished ay , if ye give way one foot s breadth axe or cord shall punish it ; and I am set if ye do aught doubtful , I will tell you honestly , here to stab you from behind . "
84899	84902	84903	84903	he	76	" You ! "
84906	84911	84903	84903	he	76	" And from behind ! "
84912	84918	84920	84921	the archer	3173	" It is right so , "
84923	84996	84920	84921	the archer	3173	" and because I like not the affair I tell it you . Ye must make the post good , Sir Richard , at your peril . O , our Crookback is a bold blade and a good warrior ; but , whether in cold blood or in hot , he will have all things done exact to his commandment . If any fail or hinder , they shall die the death . "
84997	85004	85006	85006	Richard	129	" Now , by the saints ! "
85008	85021	85006	85006	Richard	129	" is this so ? And will men follow such a leader ? "
85022	85030	85032	85033	the other	311	" Nay , they follow him gleefully , "
85035	85098	85032	85033	the other	311	" for if he be exact to punish , he is most open - handed to reward . And if he spare not the blood and sweat of others , he is ever liberal of his own , still in the first front of battle , still the last to sleep . He will go far , will Crookback Dick o Gloucester ! "
85162	85169	85170	85170	he	2681	" I like not this quietude , "
85173	85181	85170	85170	he	2681	" Doubtless they prepare us some surprise . "
86800	86803	86804	86804	he	208	" Fellow , "
86807	86817	86804	86804	he	208	" were ye here when this house was taken ? "
86818	86822	86824	86825	the archer	3173	" Let be , "
86827	86838	86824	86825	the archer	3173	" A murrain ! let be , or I strike . "
86839	86843	86845	86845	Richard	209	" Hark ye , "
86847	86859	86845	86845	Richard	209	" two can play at that . Stand and be plain . "
86943	86949	86951	86952	the archer	3173	" I pray you mercy ! "
86954	86977	86951	86952	the archer	3173	" An I had thought ye were so angry I would a been charier of crossing you . I was here indeed . "
86978	86984	86986	86986	Dick	208	" Know ye Sir Daniel ? "
86988	86995	86997	86998	the man	3175	" Well do I know him , "
87000	87007	86951	86952	the archer	3173	" Was he in the mansion ? "
87008	87016	87018	87019	the archer	3173	" Ay , sir , he was , "
87021	87038	87018	87019	the archer	3173	" but even as we entered by the yard gate he rode forth by the garden . "
87039	87042	87044	87044	Dick	208	" Alone ? "
87046	87058	87060	87061	the man	3175	" He may a had a score of lances with him , "
87063	87071	87073	87073	Shelton	129	" Lances ! No women , then ? "
87075	87082	87084	87085	the archer	3173	" Troth , I saw not , "
87087	87102	87084	87085	the archer	3173	" But there were none in the house , if that be your quest . "
87103	87108	87110	87110	Dick	208	" I thank you , "
87112	87121	87110	87110	Dick	208	" Here is a piece for your pains . "
87132	87140	87141	87141	he	208	" Inquire for me to - morrow , "
87143	87150	87151	87151	he	208	" Richard Shelt Sir Richard Shelton , "
87154	87163	87151	87151	he	208	" and I will see you handsomely rewarded . "
87298	87304	87305	87305	he	2784	" Whither , my son ? "
87310	87314	87316	87316	Dick	208	" My father , "
87318	87341	87316	87316	Dick	208	" I am here upon an errand of expedition . Stay me not . I command here for my Lord of Gloucester . "
87342	87349	87351	87352	the priest	338	" For my Lord of Gloucester ? "
87354	87365	87351	87352	the priest	338	" Hath , then , the battle gone so sore ? "
87366	87407	87413	87414	the priest	338	" The battle , father , is at an end , Lancaster clean sped , my Lord of Risingham Heaven rest him ! left upon the field . And now , with your good leave , I follow mine affairs . "
87847	87852	87854	87854	Dick	208	" Murrey and blue ! "
87856	87864	87854	87854	Dick	208	" I swear it murrey and blue ! "
88008	88018	88019	88019	he	208	" Sir Richard Shelton , ye are well found , "
88022	88077	88019	88019	he	208	" I owe you one thing that I value little , my life ; and one that I can never pay you for , this victory . Catesby , if I had ten such captains as Sir Richard , I would march forthright on London . But now , sir , claim your reward . "
88078	88084	88086	88086	Dick	208	" Freely , my lord , "
88088	88146	88086	88086	Dick	208	" freely and loudly . One hath escaped to whom I owe some grudges , and taken with him one whom I owe love and service . Give me , then , fifty lances , that I may pursue ; and for any obligation that your graciousness is pleased to allow , it shall be clean discharged . "
88147	88153	88155	88156	the duke	3689	" How call ye him ? "
88158	88163	88165	88165	Richard	129	" Sir Daniel Brackley , "
88167	88176	88178	88178	Gloucester	207	" Out upon him , double - face ! "
88180	88247	88178	88178	Gloucester	207	" Here is no reward , Sir Richard ; here is fresh service offered , and , if that ye bring his head to me , a fresh debt upon my conscience . Catesby , get him these lances ; and you , sir , bethink ye , in the meanwhile , what pleasure , honour , or profit it shall be mine to give you . "
88372	88375	88376	88376	he	2527	" Good , "
88379	88383	88376	88376	he	2527	" Hang them . "
88398	88402	88404	88404	Dick	208	" My lord , "
88406	88428	88404	88404	Dick	208	" so please you , I have found my reward . Grant me the life and liberty of yon old shipman . "
88439	88443	88444	88444	he	2527	" Sir Richard , "
88447	88531	88444	88444	he	2527	" I make not war with peacock s feathers , but steel shafts . Those that are mine enemies I slay , and that without excuse or favour . For , bethink ye , in this realm of England , that is so torn in pieces , there is not a man of mine but hath a brother or a friend upon the other party . If , then , I did begin to grant these pardons , I might sheathe my sword . "
88532	88562	88564	88564	Dick	207	" It may be so , my lord ; and yet I will be overbold , and at the risk of your disfavour , recall your lordship s promise , "
88571	88577	88578	88578	he	2527	" Mark it right well , "
88583	88633	88578	88578	he	2527	" I love not mercy , nor yet mercymongers . Ye have this day laid the foundations of high fortune . If ye oppose to me my word , which I have plighted , I will yield . But , by the glory of heaven , there your favour dies !
88634	88640	88642	88642	Dick	207	" Mine is the loss , "
88644	88650	88652	88653	the duke	3689	" Give him his sailor , "
88820	88823	88825	88825	Dick	207	" Arblaster , "
88827	88849	88825	88825	Dick	207	" I have done you ill ; but now , by the rood , I think I have cleared the score . "
88864	88867	88869	88869	Dick	207	" Come , "
88871	88929	88869	88869	Dick	207	" a life is a life , old shrew , and it is more than ships or liquor . Say ye forgive me ; for if your life be worth nothing to you , it hath cost me the beginnings of my fortune . Come , I have paid for it dearly ; be not so churlish . "
88930	88938	88940	88940	Arblaster	173	" An I had had my ship , "
88942	89026	88940	88940	Arblaster	173	" I would a been forth and safe on the high seas I and my man Tom . But ye took my ship , gossip , and I m a beggar ; and for my man Tom , a knave fellow in russet shot him down . Murrain ! quoth he , and spake never again . Murrain was the last of his words , and the poor spirit of him passed . A will never sail no more , will my Tom . "
89051	89054	89056	89056	he	207	" Nay , "
89058	89076	89056	89056	he	207	" let be . Y have played the devil with me , and let that content you . "
89192	89196	89197	89197	he	206	" This morning , "
89200	89242	89197	89197	he	206	" I was somewhat jealous of your favour ; it hath not been of a long growth ; and now , Sir Richard , it is with a very good heart that I offer you this horse to ride away with . "
89243	89250	89252	89252	Dick	207	" Suffer me yet a moment , "
89254	89264	89252	89252	Dick	207	" This favour of mine whereupon was it founded ? "
89265	89270	89272	89272	Catesby	206	" Upon your name , "
89274	89297	89272	89272	Catesby	206	" It is my lord s chief superstition . Were my name Richard , I should be an earl to - morrow . "
89298	89307	89309	89309	Dick	207	" Well , sir , I thank you , "
89311	89396	89309	89309	Dick	207	" and since I am little likely to follow these great fortunes , I will even say farewell . I will not pretend I was displeased to think myself upon the road to fortune ; but I will not pretend , neither , that I am over - sorry to be done with it . Command and riches , they are brave things , to be sure ; but a word in your ear yon duke of yours , he is a fearsome lad . "
89400	89403	89405	89405	he	206	" Nay , "
89407	89434	89405	89405	he	206	" of a verity he that rides with Crooked Dick will ride deep . Well , God keep us all from evil ! Speed ye well . "
89828	89834	89786	89786	He	76	" Ah ! lion driver ! "
89840	89850	89786	89786	He	76	" She is farther on . Ride ride fast ! "
89901	89908	89910	89911	the girl	1127	" Why do ye take me ? "
89913	89920	89910	89911	the girl	1127	" Ye but delay your speed . "
89921	89927	89929	89929	Dick	76	" Nay , Mistress Risingham , "
89931	89950	89929	89929	Dick	76	" Shoreby is full of blood and drunkenness and riot . Here ye are safe ; content ye . "
89951	89963	89964	89964	she	1127	" I will not be beholden to any of your faction , "
89967	89972	89964	89964	she	1127	" set me down . "
89973	89983	89985	89985	Dick	76	" Madam , ye know not what ye say , "
89987	89991	89985	89985	Dick	76	" Y are hurt "
89992	89997	89998	89998	she	1127	" I am not , "
90001	90009	89998	89998	she	1127	" It was my horse was slain . "
90010	90017	90019	90019	Richard	129	" It matters not one jot , "
90021	90069	90019	90019	Richard	129	" Ye are here in the midst of open snow , and compassed about with enemies . Whether ye will or not , I carry you with me . Glad am I to have the occasion ; for thus shall I repay some portion of our debt . "
90086	90090	90083	90083	she	1127	" My uncle ? "
90091	90096	90098	90098	Dick	76	" My Lord Risingham ? "
90100	90136	90098	90098	Dick	76	" I would I had good news to give you , madam ; but I have none . I saw him once in the battle , and once only . Let us hope the best . "
90429	90434	90436	90436	Dick	76	" How say ye , "
90443	90455	90436	90436	Dick	76	" to follow straight on , or strike across for Tunstall ? "
90456	90460	90462	90467	the man - at - arms	2901	" Sir Richard , "
90469	90479	90462	90467	the man - at - arms	2901	" I would follow the line until they scatter . "
90480	90488	90490	90490	Dick	76	" Ye are , doubtless , right , "
90492	90592	90490	90490	Dick	76	" but we came right hastily upon the errand , even as the time commanded . Here are no houses , neither for food nor shelter , and by the morrow s dawn we shall know both cold fingers and an empty belly . How say ye , lads ? Will ye stand a pinch for expedition s sake , or shall we turn by Holywood and sup with Mother Church ? The case being somewhat doubtful , I will drive no man ; yet if ye would suffer me to lead you , ye would choose the first . "
90897	90904	90905	90905	Dick	76	" Well , we are outwitted , "
90908	90934	90905	90905	Dick	76	" Strike we for Holywood , after all . It is still nearer us than Tunstall or should be by the station of the sun . "
91225	91228	91230	91230	Dick	76	" Madam , "
91232	91331	91230	91230	Dick	76	" let me beseech you , punish me not so cruelly . Wherein I have offended you , I know not ; I have , indeed , carried you away , but with a friendly violence ; I have , indeed , exposed you to the inclemency of night , but the hurry that lies upon me hath for its end the preservation of another , who is no less frail and no less unfriended than yourself . At least , madam , punish not yourself ; and eat , if not for hunger , then for strength . "
91332	91345	91346	91346	she	2917	" I will eat nothing at the hands that slew my kinsman , "
91349	91353	91354	91354	Dick	76	" Dear madam , "
91357	91370	91354	91354	Dick	76	" I swear to you upon the rood I touched him not . "
91371	91380	91381	91381	she	2917	" Swear to me that he still lives , "
91384	91392	91394	91394	Dick	76	" I will not palter with you , "
91396	91413	91394	91394	Dick	76	" Pity bids me to wound you . In my heart I do believe him dead . "
91414	91422	91423	91423	she	2917	" And ye ask me to eat ! "
91426	91485	91423	91423	she	2917	" Ay , and they call you sir ! Y have won your spurs by my good kinsman s murder . And had I not been fool and traitor both , and saved you in your enemy s house , ye should have died the death , and he he that was worth twelve of you were living . "
91486	91505	91507	91507	Dick	76	" I did but my man s best , even as your kinsman did upon the other party , "
91509	91531	91507	91507	Dick	76	" Were he still living as I vow to Heaven I wish it ! he would praise , not blame me . "
91532	91539	91540	91540	she	2919	" Sir Daniel hath told me , "
91543	91623	91540	91540	she	2919	" He marked you at the barricade . Upon you , he saith , their party foundered ; it was you that won the battle . Well , then , it was you that killed my good Lord Risingham , as sure as though ye had strangled him . And ye would have me eat with you and your hands not washed from killing ? But Sir Daniel hath sworn your downfall . He tis that will avenge me ! "
91644	91652	91653	91653	he	2920	" Do ye hold me so guilty ? "
91656	91668	91653	91653	he	2920	" you that defended me you that are Joanna s friend ? "
91669	91677	91678	91678	she	2920	" What made ye in the battle ? "
91681	91718	91678	91678	she	2920	" Y are of no party ; y are but a lad but legs and body , without government of wit or counsel ! Wherefore did ye fight ? For the love of hurt , pardy ! "
91719	91722	91724	91724	Dick	76	" Nay , "
91726	91770	91724	91724	Dick	76	" I know not . But as the realm of England goes , if that a poor gentleman fight not upon the one side , perforce he must fight upon the other . He may not stand alone ; tis not in nature . "
91771	91783	91785	91787	the young lady	2012	" They that have no judgment should not draw the sword , "
91789	91819	91785	91787	the young lady	2012	" Ye that fight but for a hazard , what are ye but a butcher ? War is but noble by the cause , and y have disgraced it . "
91820	91823	91827	91827	Dick	76	" Madam , "
91829	92045	91827	91827	Dick	76	" I do partly see mine error . I have made too much haste ; I have been busy before my time . Already I stole a ship thinking , I do swear it , to do well and thereby brought about the death of many innocent , and the grief and ruin of a poor old man whose face this very day hath stabbed me like a dagger . And for this morning , I did but design to do myself credit , and get fame to marry with , and , behold ! I have brought about the death of your dear kinsman that was good to me . And what besides , I know not . For , alas ! I may have set York upon the throne , and that may be the worser cause , and may do hurt to England . O , madam , I do see my sin . I am unfit for life . I will , for penance sake and to avoid worse evil , once I have finished this adventure , get me to a cloister . I will forswear Joanna and the trade of arms . I will be a friar , and pray for your good kinsman s spirit all my days . "
92094	92097	92098	92098	he	76	" Madam , "
92128	92181	92117	92117	her	2012	" madam , will not this content you ? I give up all to undo what I have done amiss ; I make heaven certain for Lord Risingham . And all this upon the very day that I have won my spurs , and thought myself the happiest young gentleman on ground . "
92182	92186	92187	92187	she	2012	" O boy , "
92189	92193	92187	92187	she	2012	" good boy ! "
92254	92258	92259	92259	she	2012	" But come , "
92266	92282	92259	92259	she	2012	" you that are a captain , ye must eat . Why sup ye not ? "
92283	92288	92290	92290	Dick	76	" Dear Mistress Risingham , "
92292	92334	92290	92290	Dick	76	" I did but wait first upon my prisoner ; but , to say truth , penitence will no longer suffer me to endure the sight of food . I were better to fast , dear lady , and to pray . "
92335	92340	92341	92341	she	2012	" Call me Alicia , "
92344	92393	92341	92341	she	2012	" are we not old friends ? And now , come , I will eat with you , bit for bit and sup for sup ; so if ye eat not , neither will I ; but if ye eat hearty , I will dine like a ploughman . "
92468	92473	92474	92474	she	2012	" Lion - driver , "
92480	92493	92474	92474	she	2012	" ye do not admire a maid in a man s jerkin ? "
92535	92537	92538	92538	he	129	" Madam "
92550	92553	92554	92554	she	2012	" Nay , "
92557	92586	92554	92554	she	2012	" it skills not to deny ; Joanna hath told me , but come , Sir Lion - driver , look at me am I so homely come ! "
92595	92602	92604	92604	Dick	76	" Ye are something smallish , indeed "
92628	92631	92632	92632	she	2012	" Smallish ! "
92635	92680	92632	92632	she	2012	" Nay , now , be honest as ye are bold ; I am a dwarf , or little better ; but for all that come , tell me ! for all that , passably fair to look upon ; is t not so ? "
92681	92689	92691	92693	the distressed knight	2926	" Nay , madam , exceedingly fair , "
92701	92714	92715	92715	she	2012	" And a man would be right glad to we d me ? "
92718	92726	92728	92728	Dick	76	" O , madam , right glad ! "
92730	92735	92737	92737	she	2012	" Call me Alicia , "
92739	92742	92691	92693	the distressed knight	2926	" Alicia , "
92747	92756	92757	92757	she	2012	" Well , then , lion - driver , "
92760	92788	92757	92757	she	2012	" sith that ye slew my kinsman , and left me without stay , ye owe me , in honour , every reparation ; do ye not ? "
92789	92795	92797	92797	Dick	76	" I do , madam , "
92799	92820	92797	92797	Dick	76	" Although , upon my heart , I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight s blood . "
92821	92827	92828	92828	she	2012	" Would ye evade me ? "
92831	92854	92856	92856	Richard	129	" Madam , not so . I have told you ; at your bidding , I will even turn me a monk , "
92858	92869	92870	92870	she	2012	" Then , in honour , ye belong to me ? "
92873	92881	92883	92885	the young man	2017	" In honour , madam , I suppose "
92887	92891	92892	92892	she	2012	" Go to ! "
92895	92918	92892	92892	she	2012	" ye are too full of catches . In honour do ye belong to me , till ye have paid the evil ? "
92919	92926	92928	92928	Dick	76	" In honour , I do , "
92930	92935	92936	92936	she	2012	" Hear , then , "
92939	92977	92979	92979	she	2012	" Ye would make but a sad friar , methinks ; and since I am to dispose of you at pleasure , I will even take you for my husband . Nay , now , no words ! "
92981	93055	92979	92979	she	2012	" They will avail you nothing . For see how just it is , that you who deprived me of one home , should supply me with another . And as for Joanna , she will be the first , believe me , to commend the change ; for , after all , as we be dear friends , what matters it with which of us ye we d ? Not one whit ! "
93056	93059	93061	93061	Dick	76	" Madam , "
93063	93136	93061	93061	Dick	76	" I will go into a cloister , an ye please to bid me ; but to we d with anyone in this big world besides Joanna Sedley is what I will consent to neither for man s force nor yet for lady s pleasure . Pardon me if I speak my plain thoughts plainly ; but where a maid is very bold , a poor man must even be the bolder . "
93137	93140	93141	93141	she	2928	" Dick , "
93144	93271	93141	93141	she	2928	" ye sweet boy , ye must come and kiss me for that word . Nay , fear not , ye shall kiss me for Joanna ; and when we meet , I shall give it back to her , and say I stole it . And as for what ye owe me , why , dear simpleton , methinks ye were not alone in that great battle ; and even if York be on the throne , it was not you that set him there . But for a good , sweet , honest heart , Dick , y are all that ; and if I could find it in my soul to envy your Joanna anything , I would even envy her your love . "
93759	93773	93775	93775	Alicia	218	" But yet , for sure , I heard the clash of harness , "
93777	93780	93782	93782	Dick	76	" Madam , "
93798	93819	93782	93782	Dick	76	" I would not hint ye were mistaken ; but it might well have come from either of the camps . "
93820	93831	93832	93832	she	218	" It came not thence . It came from westward , "
93835	93843	93845	93845	Dick	76	" It may be what it will , "
93847	93881	93845	93845	Dick	76	" and it must be as heaven please . Reck we not a jot , but push on the livelier , and put it to the touch . Up , friends enough breathed . "
94161	94164	94166	94166	he	76	" Well , "
94170	94190	94166	94166	he	76	" even if I lose my horses , let me get my Joanna , and why should I complain ? "
94247	94250	94251	94251	he	76	" Bennet , "
94253	94276	94251	94251	he	76	" Bennet , old friend , yield ye . Ye will but spill men s lives in vain , if ye resist . "
94277	94286	94288	94288	Hatch	77	" Tis Master Shelton , by St. Barbary ! "
94290	94303	94288	94288	Hatch	77	" Yield me ? Ye ask much . What force have ye ? "
94304	94318	94320	94320	Dick	76	" I tell you , Bennet , ye are both outnumbered and begirt , "
94322	94353	94320	94320	Dick	76	" Casar and Charlemagne would cry for quarter . I have two score men at my whistle , and with one shoot of arrows I could answer for you all . "
94354	94358	94360	94360	Bennet	77	" Master Dick , "
94362	94381	94360	94360	Bennet	77	" it goes against my heart ; but I must do my duty . The saints help you ! "
94467	94472	94473	94473	she	117	" Here , Dick ! "
94557	94560	94561	94561	he	76	" On ! "
94564	94578	94561	94561	he	76	" Shoot , boys , and keep to cover . England and York ! "
94627	94632	94634	94634	Dick	76	" Rally , rally ! "
94636	94646	94634	94634	Dick	76	" Rally upon me ! Rally for your lives ! "
94854	94860	94861	94861	he	76	" The saints enlighten me ! "
94864	94883	94861	94861	he	76	" It is well I was knighted for this morning s matter ; this doth me little honour . "
95018	95030	95031	95031	Dick	76	" An I had but kept a reserve of them together , "
95036	95063	95031	95031	Dick	76	" I could have turned the tables yet ! Well , we live and learn ; next time it shall go better , by the rood . "
95064	95069	95071	95071	Joanna	117	" Nay , Dick , "
95073	95085	95071	95071	Joanna	117	" what matters it ? Here we are together once again . "
95138	95141	95142	95142	he	76	" Sweetheart , "
95145	95300	95142	95142	he	76	" if ye forgive this blunderer , what care I ? Make we direct for Holywood ; there lieth your good guardian and my better friend , Lord Foxham . There shall we be we d ; and whether poor or wealthy , famous or unknown , what , matters it ? This day , dear love , I won my spurs ; I was commended by great men for my valour ; I thought myself the goodliest man of war in all broad England . Then , first , I fell out of my favour with the great ; and now have I been well thrashed , and clean lost my soldiers . There was a downfall for conceit ! But , dear , I care not dear , if ye still love me and will we d , I would have my knighthood done away , and mind it not a jot . "
95301	95305	95306	95306	she	2988	" My Dick ! "
95309	95316	95306	95306	she	2988	" And did they knight you ? "
95317	95328	95329	95329	he	2989	" Ay , dear , ye are my lady now , "
95334	95348	95329	95329	he	2989	" or ye shall , ere noon to - morrow will ye not ? "
95349	95361	95362	95362	she	2988	" That will I , Dick , with a glad heart , "
95365	95378	95329	95329	he	2989	" Ay , sir ? Methought ye were to be a monk ! "
95386	95389	95391	95391	Joanna	117	" Alicia ! "
95393	95397	95399	95401	the young lady	2012	" Even so , "
95406	95445	95399	95401	the young lady	2012	" Alicia , whom ye left for dead , and whom your lion - driver found , and brought to life again , and , by my sooth , made love to , if ye want to know ! "
95446	95453	95455	95455	Joanna	117	" I ll not believe it , "
95457	95460	95455	95455	Joanna	117	" Dick ! "
95461	95464	95466	95466	Alicia	218	" Dick ! "
95468	95486	95487	95487	she	2012	" Dick , indeed ! Ay , fair sir , and ye desert poor damsels in distress , "
95496	95515	95487	95487	she	2012	" Ye leave them planted behind oaks . But they say true the age of chivalry is dead . "
95516	95519	95521	95521	Dick	76	" Madam , "
95526	95554	95521	95521	Dick	76	" upon my soul I had forgotten you outright . Madam , ye must try to pardon me . Ye see , I had new found Joanna ! "
95555	95568	95569	95569	she	2012	" I did not suppose that ye had done it o purpose , "
95572	95595	95596	95596	she	2012	" But I will be cruelly avenged . I will tell a secret to my Lady Shelton she that is to be , "
95601	95604	95605	95605	she	2012	" Joanna , "
95608	95723	95605	95605	she	2012	" I believe , upon my soul , your sweetheart is a bold fellow in a fight , but he is , let me tell you plainly , the softest - hearted simpleton in England . Go to ye may do your pleasure with him ! And now , fool children , first kiss me , either one of you , for luck and kindness ; and then kiss each other just one minute by the glass , and not one second longer ; and then let us all three set forth for Holywood as fast as we can stir ; for these woods , methinks , are full of peril and exceeding cold . "
95724	95734	95736	95736	Joanna	117	" But did my Dick make love to you ? "
95745	95751	95753	95753	Alicia	218	" Nay , fool girl , "
95755	95830	95753	95753	Alicia	218	" it was I made love to him . I offered to marry him , indeed ; but he bade me go marry with my likes . These were his words . Nay , that I will say : he is more plain than pleasant . But now , children , for the sake of sense , set forward . Shall we go once more over the dingle , or push straight for Holywood ? "
95831	95834	95836	95836	Dick	76	" Why , "
95838	95942	95836	95836	Dick	76	" I would like dearly to get upon a horse ; for I have been sore mauled and beaten , one way and another , these last days , and my poor body is one bruise . But how think ye ? If the men , upon the alarm of the fighting , had fled away , we should have gone about for nothing . Tis but some three short miles to Holywood direct ; the bell hath not beat nine ; the snow is pretty firm to walk upon , the moon clear ; how if we went even as we are ? "
95943	95946	95948	95948	Alicia	218	" Agreed , "
96264	96269	96271	96271	Richard	74	" By the mass , "
96273	96306	96271	96271	Richard	74	" there are Lord Foxham s fellows still encamped . The messenger hath certainly miscarried . Well , then , so better . We have power at hand to face Sir Daniel . "
96540	96545	96547	96547	Richard	74	" How , sir ? "
96549	96559	96547	96547	Richard	74	" Have ye brought me Sir Daniel s head ? "
96560	96565	96567	96567	Dick	207	" My lord duke , "
96579	96605	96567	96567	Dick	207	" I have not even the good fortune to return with my command . I have been , so please your grace , well beaten . "
96615	96625	96626	96626	he	207	" I gave you fifty lances , 3 sir , "
96629	96644	96646	96648	the young knight	2681	" My lord duke , I had but fifty men - at - arms , "
96650	96655	96657	96657	Gloucester	207	" How is this ? "
96659	96667	96657	96657	Gloucester	207	" He did ask me fifty lances . "
96668	96675	96677	96677	Catesby	206	" May it please your grace , "
96681	96692	96677	96677	Catesby	206	" for a pursuit we gave him but the horsemen . "
96693	96698	96700	96700	Richard	74	" It is well , "
96704	96711	96700	96700	Richard	74	" Shelton , ye may go . "
96712	96715	96717	96718	Lord Foxham	157	" Stay ! "
96720	96750	96717	96718	Lord Foxham	157	" This young man likewise had a charge from me . It may be he hath better sped . Say , Master Shelton , have ye found the maid ? "
96751	96760	96762	96762	Dick	207	" I praise the saints , my lord , "
96764	96771	96762	96762	Dick	207	" she is in this house . "
96772	96787	96789	96790	Lord Foxham	157	" Is it even so ? Well , then , my lord the duke , "
96792	96816	96789	96790	Lord Foxham	157	" with your good will , to - morrow , before the army march , I do propose a marriage . This young squire "
96817	96821	96823	96823	Catesby	206	" Young knight , "
96825	96833	96835	96836	Lord Foxham	157	" Say ye so , Sir William ? "
96838	96852	96854	96854	Gloucester	207	" I did myself , and for good service , dub him knight , "
96856	96931	96854	96854	Gloucester	207	" He hath twice manfully served me . It is not valour of hands , it is a man s mind of iron , that he lacks . He will not rise , Lord Foxham . Tis a fellow that will fight indeed bravely in a mellay , but hath a capon s heart . Howbeit , if he is to marry , marry him in the name of Mary , and be done ! "
96932	96944	96946	96947	Lord Foxham	157	" Nay , he is a brave lad I know it , "
96949	96975	96946	96947	Lord Foxham	157	" Content ye , then , Sir Richard . I have compounded this affair with Master Hamley , and to - morrow ye shall we d. "
97030	97036	97037	97037	he	3026	" Victory , my lord , "
97321	97324	97325	97325	he	207	" Stand ! "
97328	97332	97325	97325	he	207	" Who goes ? "
97405	97410	97412	97413	Sir Daniel	72	" Well , Dickon , "
97415	97430	97412	97413	Sir Daniel	72	" how is it to be ? Do ye make war upon the fallen ? "
97431	97440	97442	97443	the lad	309	" I made no war upon your life , "
97445	97465	97442	97443	the lad	309	" I was your true friend until ye sought for mine ; but ye have sought for it greedily . "
97466	97472	97474	97475	the knight	438	" Nay self - defence , "
97477	97535	97474	97475	the knight	438	" And now , boy , the news of this battle , and the presence of yon crooked devil here in mine own wood , have broken me beyond all help . I go to Holywood for sanctuary ; thence overseas , with what I can carry , and to begin life again in Burgundy or France . "
97536	97544	97546	97546	Dick	207	" Ye may not go to Holywood , "
97548	97554	97556	97557	the knight	438	" How ! May not ? "
97559	97572	97574	97574	Dick	207	" Look ye , Sir Daniel , this is my marriage morn , "
97576	97737	97574	97574	Dick	207	" and yon sun that is to rise will make the brightest day that ever shone for me . Your life is forfeit doubly forfeit , for my father s death and your own practices to meward . But I myself have done amiss ; I have brought about men s deaths ; and upon this glad day I will be neither judge nor hangman . An ye were the devil , I would not lay a hand on you . An ye were the devil , ye might go where ye will for me . Seek God s forgiveness ; mine ye have freely . But to go on to Holywood is different . I carry arms for York , and I will suffer no spy within their lines . Hold it , then , for certain , if ye set one foot before another , I will uplift my voice and call the nearest post to seize you . "
97738	97743	97745	97746	Sir Daniel	72	" Ye mock me , "
97748	97757	97745	97746	Sir Daniel	72	" I have no safety out of Holywood . "
97758	97764	97766	97766	Richard	129	" I care no more , "
97768	97847	97766	97766	Richard	129	" I let you go east , west , or south ; north I will not . Holywood is shut against you . Go , and seek not to return . For , once ye are gone , I will warn every post about this army , and there will be so shrewd a watch upon all pilgrims that , once again , were ye the very devil , ye would find it ruin to make the essay . "
97848	97853	97855	97856	Sir Daniel	72	" Ye doom me , "
97860	97866	97868	97868	Richard	129	" I doom you not , "
97870	97934	97868	97868	Richard	129	" If it so please you to set your valour against mine , come on ; and though I fear it be disloyal to my party , I will take the challenge openly and fully , fight you with mine own single strength , and call for none to help me . So shall I avenge my father , with a perfect conscience . "
97935	97938	97940	97941	Sir Daniel	72	" Ay , "
97943	97953	97940	97941	Sir Daniel	72	" y have a long sword against my dagger . "
97954	97961	97963	97963	Dick	207	" I rely upon Heaven only , "
97976	98009	97966	97966	his	207	" Now , if your ill - fate bids you , come ; and , under the pleasure of the Almighty , I make myself bold to feed your bones to foxes . "
98010	98019	98021	98022	the knight	438	" I did but try you , Dickon , "
98032	98040	98021	98022	the knight	438	" I would not spill your blood . "
98041	98052	98054	98054	Shelton	129	" Go , then , ere it be too late , "
98056	98096	98054	98054	Shelton	129	" In five minutes I will call the post . I do perceive that I am too long - suffering . Had but our places been reversed , I should have been bound hand and foot some minutes past . "
98097	98106	98108	98109	Sir Daniel	72	" Well , Dickon , I will go , "
98111	98127	98108	98109	Sir Daniel	72	" When we next meet , it shall repent you that ye were so harsh . "
98285	98291	98292	98292	he	418	" Is the arrow black ? "
98295	98300	98302	98302	Dick	207	" It is black , "
98505	98508	98509	98509	he	207	" Richard , "
98515	98546	98509	98509	he	207	" I heard you . Ye took the better part and pardoned ; I took the worse , and there lies the clay of mine enemy . Pray for me . "
98555	98558	98560	98560	Richard	129	" Sir , "
98562	98654	98560	98560	Richard	129	" I will pray for you , indeed ; though how I may prevail I wot not . But if ye have so long pursued revenge , and find it now of such a sorry flavour , bethink ye , were it not well to pardon others ? Hatch he is dead , poor shrew ! I would have spared a better ; and for Sir Daniel , here lies his body . But for the priest , if I might anywise prevail , I would have you let him go . "
98665	98668	98669	98669	he	100	" Nay , "
98672	98737	98669	98669	he	100	" the devil is still strong within me . But be at rest ; the Black Arrow flieth nevermore the fellowship is broken . They that still live shall come to their quiet and ripe end , in Heaven s good time , for me ; and for yourself , go where your better fortune calls you , and think no more of Ellis . "
98791	98797	98798	98798	he	229	" Is this the maid ? "
98811	98814	98815	98815	he	229	" Minion , "
98818	98829	98815	98815	he	229	" hold up your face until I see its favour . "
98839	98844	98845	98845	he	229	" Ye are fair , "
98850	98876	98845	98845	he	229	" and , as they tell me , dowered . How if I offered you a brave marriage , as became your face and parentage ? "
98877	98882	98884	98884	Joanna	117	" My lord duke , "
98886	98902	98884	98884	Joanna	117	" may it please your grace , I had rather we d with Sir Richard . "
98903	98907	98908	98908	he	229	" How so ? "
98913	98954	98908	98908	he	229	" Marry but the man I name to you , and he shall be my lord , and you my lady , before night . For Sir Richard , let me tell you plainly , he will die Sir Richard . "
98955	98975	98977	98977	Joanna	117	" I ask no more of Heaven , my lord , than but to die Sir Richard s wife , "
98979	98988	98990	98990	Gloucester	207	" Look ye at that , my lord , "
98997	99083	98990	98990	Gloucester	207	" Here be a pair for you . The lad , when for good services I gave him his choice of my favour , chose but the grace of an old , drunken shipman . I did warn him freely , but he was stout in his besottedness . Here dieth your favour , said I ; and he , my lord , with a most assured impertinence , Mine be the loss , quoth he . It shall be so , by the rood ! "
99084	99089	99091	99091	Alicia	218	" Said he so ? "
99093	99102	99091	99091	Alicia	218	" Then well said , lion - driver ! "
99103	99108	99110	99111	the duke	3689	" Who is this ? "
99113	99121	99123	99124	Lord Foxham	157	" A prisoner of Sir Richard s , "
99126	99131	99123	99124	Lord Foxham	157	" Mistress Alicia Risingham . "
99132	99143	99145	99146	the duke	3689	" See that she be married to a sure man , "
99148	99164	99166	99167	Lord Foxham	157	" I had thought of my kinsman , Hamley , an it like your grace , "
99169	99177	99166	99167	Lord Foxham	157	" He hath well served the cause . "
99178	99184	99186	99186	Richard	129	" It likes me well , "
99188	99205	99186	99186	Richard	129	" Let them be wedded speedily . Say , fair maid , will you we d ? "
99206	99211	99213	99213	Alicia	218	" My lord duke , "
99215	99222	99213	99213	Alicia	218	" so as the man is straight "
99238	99246	99248	99248	Richard	129	" He is straight , my mistress , "
99252	99277	99278	99278	he	129	" I am the only crookback of my party ; we are else passably well shapen . Ladies , and you , my lord , "
99289	99317	99278	99278	he	129	" judge me not too churlish if I leave you . A captain , in the time of war , hath not the ordering of his hours . "
99333	99336	99338	99338	Alicia	218	" Alack , "
99340	99345	99338	99338	Alicia	218	" I am shent ! "
99346	99352	99354	99355	Lord Foxham	157	" Ye know him not , "
99357	99372	99354	99355	Lord Foxham	157	" It is but a trifle ; he hath already clean forgot your words . "
99373	99385	99387	99387	Alicia	218	" He is , then , the very flower of knighthood , "
99389	99398	99400	99401	Lord Foxham	157	" Nay , he but mindeth other things , "
99403	99409	99400	99401	Lord Foxham	157	" Tarry we no more . "
