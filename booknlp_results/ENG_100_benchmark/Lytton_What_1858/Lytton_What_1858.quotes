691	698	682	682	his	1283	" a nose in the air , "
1283	1293	1295	1295	he	1297	" Found in the act , sentenced , punished , "
1307	1324	1295	1295	he	1297	" And now , good for evil , here 's a ribbon for you ; choose . "
1376	1428	1357	1361	his elder and wiser friend	1303	" Dr. Franklin tells us that once in his life he paid too dear for a whistle ; but then he was only seven years old , and a whistle has its uses . But to pay such a price for a scratch - back ! - Prodigal ! Come along . "
1468	1471	1473	1474	the elder	1306	" Lasses , "
1486	1539	1480	1480	his	1306	" ribbons are plentiful , - shillings scarce ; and kisses , though pleasant in private , are insipid in public . What , still ! Beware ! know that , innocent as we seem , we are women - eaters ; and if you follow us farther , you are devoured ! "
1626	1631	1633	1635	the elder friend	1315	" Oho , Lionel ! "
1637	1649	1680	1680	he	1306	" Thespian and classical , - worth seeing , no doubt . "
1683	1698	1680	1680	he	1306	" You seem attracted , sir ; you have probably already witnessed the performance . "
1699	1702	1704	1705	the Cobbler	1317	" Yes , "
1707	1747	1704	1705	the Cobbler	1317	" this is the third day , and to - morrow 's the last . I are n't missed once yet , and I sha ' n't miss ; but it are n't what it was a while back . "
1748	1822	1680	1680	he	1306	" ' That is sad ; but then the same thing is said of everything by everybody who has reached your respectable age , friend . Summers , and suns , stupid old watering - places , and pretty young women , ` are n't what they were a while back . ' If men and things go on degenerating in this way , our grandchildren will have a dull time of it . "
1858	1931	1849	1849	Cobbler	420	" You speaks truly and cleverly , sir . But if old folks do always say that things are worse than they were , ben't there always summat in what is always said ? I 'm for the old times ; my neighbour , Joe Spruce , is for the new , and says we are all a - progressing . But he 's a pink ; I ' m a blue . "
1932	1938	1942	1942	Lionel	419	" You are a blue ? "
1944	1950	1942	1942	Lionel	419	" I do n't understand . "
1951	1997	1849	1849	Cobbler	420	" Young ' un , I 'm a Tory , - that 's blue ; and Spruce is a Rad , - that 's pink ! And , what is more to the purpose , he is a tailor , and I 'm a cobbler . "
1998	2001	2003	2004	the elder	1306	" Aha ! "
2010	2021	2003	2004	the elder	1306	" more to the purpose is it ? How so ? "
2083	2089	2091	2092	the Cobbler	1317	" You see , sir , "
2094	2164	2091	2092	the Cobbler	1317	" that a man 's business has a deal to do with his manner of thinking . Every trade , I take it , has ideas as belong to it . Butchers do n't see life as bakers do ; and if you talk to a dozen tallow - chandlers , then to a dozen blacksmiths , you will see tallow - chandlers are peculiar , and blacksmiths too . "
2165	2172	2174	2174	he	1317	" You are a keen observer , "
2182	2197	2174	2174	he	1317	" your remark is new to me ; I dare say it is true . "
2198	2298	2300	2308	the man of leather , with a majestic air	1327	" Course it is ; and the stars have summat to do with it ; for if they order a man 's calling , it stands to reason that they order a man 's mind to fit it . Now , a tailor sits on his board with others , and is always a - talking with 'em , and a - reading the news ; therefore he thinks , as his fellows do , smart and sharp , bang up to the day , but nothing ' riginal and all his own , like . But a cobbler , "
2338	2338	2322	2322	he	1327	"
2339	2347	2349	2350	our friend	1330	" You enlighten me more and more , "
2362	2398	2349	2350	our friend	1330	" a tailor is gregarious , a cobbler solitary . The gregarious go with the future , the solitary stick by the past . I understand why you are a Tory and perhaps a poet . "
2399	2407	2409	2410	the Cobbler	1317	" Well , a bit of one , "
2417	2443	2409	2410	the Cobbler	1317	" And many 's the cobbler who is a poet , - or discovers marvellous things in a crystal , - whereas a tailor , sir "
2449	2464	2409	2410	the Cobbler	1317	" only sees the upper leather of the world 's sole in a newspaper . "
2552	2557	2559	2559	Lionel	419	" Poor little thing ! "
2561	2566	2568	2569	the Cobbler	1317	" Poor little thing ! "
2738	2742	2715	2717	a little lady	1343	" Poor thing ! "
2743	2753	2755	2756	the Cobbler	1317	" You should see her act , young gents , "
2780	2780	2775	2775	him	1346	"
2781	2786	2755	2756	the Cobbler	1317	" Who 's he ? "
2787	2800	2775	2775	him	1346	" Waife , sir ; mayhap you have heard speak of Waife ? "
2801	2809	2755	2756	the Cobbler	1317	" I blush to say , no . "
2810	2855	2775	2775	him	1346	" Why , he might have made his fortune at Common Garden ; but that 's a long story . Poor fellow ! he 's broke down now , anyhow . But she takes care of him , little darling : God bless thee ! "
2882	2891	2893	2898	the elder of the young men	1350	" By the brush and pallet of Raphael ! "
2900	2915	2893	2898	the elder of the young men	1350	" before I am many hours older I must have that child 's head ! "
2916	2922	2924	2925	the Cobbler	1317	" Her head , man ! "
2929	2952	2893	2898	the elder of the young men	1350	" In my sketch - book . You are a poet , - I a painter . You know the little girl ? "
2953	3067	2893	2898	the elder of the young men	1350	" Do n't I ! She and her grandfather lodge with me ; her grandfather , - that 's Waife , - marvellous man ! But they ill - uses him ; and if it warn't for her , he 'd starve . He fed them all once : he can feed them no longer ; he 'd starve . That 's the world : they use up a genus , and when it falls on the road , push on ; that 's what Joe Spruce calls a - progressing . But there 's the drum ! they 're a - going to act ; wo n't you look in , gents ? "
3068	3072	3074	3074	Lionel	419	" Of course , "
3077	3105	3074	3074	Lionel	419	" of course . And , hark ye , Vance , we 'll toss up which shall be the first to take that little girl 's head . "
3106	3115	3117	3117	Vance	425	" Murderer in either sense of the word ! "
3221	3225	3227	3227	Vance	425	" Very dear , "
3282	3292	3293	3293	We	1364	" The Remorseless Baron and the Bandit 's Child . "

4150	4153	4148	4148	Vance	425	" bravo ; "
4267	4272	4275	4292	the Bandit , who appeared but in the last scene , and even then uttered not a word	1440	" Waife , Waife ! "
4365	4375	4359	4360	the Cobbler	1317	" might have made a fortune at Covent Garden . "
4441	4446	4448	4451	many a village voice	1446	" Waife , Waife ! "
4708	4713	4706	4706	we	1465	" Behind the Scenes . "
4859	4922	4849	4849	Vance	425	" Sir , allow me to congratulate you ; your bow was admirable . I have never seen John Kemble ; before my time : but I shall fancy I have seen him now , - seen him on the night of his retirement from the stage . As to your grandchild , Miss Juliet Araminta , she is a perfect chrysolite . "
4945	4965	4929	4931	the Remorseless Baron	11136	" What do you do here , sir ? I allow no conspirators behind the scenes earwigging my people . "
4966	4997	5041	5042	the manager	1477	" I beg pardon respectfully : I am an artist , - a pupil of the Royal Academy ; I should like to make a sketch of Miss Juliet Araminta . "
4998	5003	4929	4931	the Remorseless Baron	11136	" Sketch ! nonsense . "
5004	5007	5009	5009	Lionel	419	" Sir , "
5019	5035	5009	5009	Lionel	419	" my friend would , I am sure , pay for the sitting - handsomely ! "
5036	5039	5041	5042	the manager	1477	" Ha ! "
5046	5130	5041	5042	the manager	1477	" you speak like a gentleman , sir : but , sir , Miss Juliet Araminta is under my protection ; in fact , she is my property . Call and speak to me about it to - morrow , before the first performance begins , which is twelve o'clock . Happy to see any of your friends in the reserved seats . Busy now , and - and - in short - excuse me - servant , sir - servant , sir . "
5235	5261	5187	5187	Lionel	419	" What on earth are you thinking of , Lionel ? I have put to you three questions , and you have not answered one . "
5262	5265	5267	5267	Lionel	419	" Vance , "
5271	5290	5267	5267	Lionel	419	" the oddest thing ! I am so disappointed in that little girl , - greedy and mercenary ! "
5291	5306	5187	5187	Lionel	419	" Precocious villain ! how do you know that she is greedy and mercenary ? "
5307	5423	5267	5267	Lionel	419	" Listen : when that surly old manager came up to you , I said something - civil , of course - to Waife , who answered in a hoarse , broken voice , but in very good language . Well , when I told the manager that you would pay for the sitting , the child caught hold of my arm hastily , pulled me down to her own height , and whispered , ' How much will he give ? ' Confused by a question so point - blank , I answered at random , ' I do n't know ; ten shillings , perhaps . ' You should have seen her face ! "
5424	5442	5444	5444	Vance	425	" See her face ! radiant , - I should think so . Too much by half ! "
5446	5452	5444	5444	Vance	425	" Ten shillings ! Spendthrift ! "
5453	5650	5652	5652	Lionel	419	" Too much ! she looked as you might look if one offered you ten shillings for your picture of ' Julius Caesar considering whether he should cross the Rubicon . ' But when the manager had declared her to be his property , and appointed you to call to - morrow , - implying that he was to be paid for allowing her to sit , - her countenance became overcast , and she muttered sullenly , ' I 'll not sit ; I 'll not ! ' Then she turned to her grandfather , and something very quick and close was whispered between the two ; and she pulled me by the sleeve , and said in my ear - oh , but so eagerly ! - ' I want three pounds , sir , - three pounds ! - if he would give three pounds ; and come to our lodgings , - Mr. Merle , Willow Lane . Three pounds , - three ! ' And with those words hissing in my ear , and coming from that fairy mouth , which ought to drop pearls and diamonds , I left her , "
5662	5668	5652	5652	Lionel	419	" and lost an illusion ! "
5669	5673	5675	5675	Vance	425	" Three pounds ! "
5700	5830	5689	5689	his	425	" three pounds ! - a fabulous sum ! Who has three pounds to throw away ? Dukes , with a hundred thousand a year in acres , have not three pounds to draw out of their pockets in that reckless , profligate manner . Three pounds ! - what could I not buy for three pounds ? I could buy the Dramatic Library , bound in calf , for three pounds ; I could buy a dress coat for three pounds silk lining not included ; I could be lodged for a month for three pounds ! And a jade in tinsel , just entering on her teens , to ask three pounds for what ? for becoming immortal on the canvas of Francis Vance ? - bother ! "
5865	5882	5862	5863	the Cobbler	1317	" Well , master , did not she act fine ? - how d'ye like her ? "
5883	5901	5862	5863	the Cobbler	1317	" Not much in her natural character ; but she sets a mighty high value on herself . "
5902	5911	5862	5863	the Cobbler	1317	" Anan , I do n't take you . "
5912	5930	5932	5932	Lionel	419	" She 'll not catch me taking her ! Three pounds ! - three kingdoms ! Stay , "
5937	5952	5932	5932	Lionel	419	" did not you say she lodged with you ? Are you Mr. Merle ? "
5953	5970	5862	5863	the Cobbler	1317	" Merle 's my name , and she do lodge with me , - Willow Lane . "
5971	6000	6002	6002	Lionel	419	" Come this way , then , a few yards down the road , - more quiet . Tell me what the child means , if you can ; "
6059	6064	6065	6065	he	420	" Poor little thing ! "
6090	6105	6065	6065	he	420	" ' tis all for her grandfather ; I guess , - I guess . "
6106	6109	6111	6111	Lionel	419	" Oh , "
6115	6135	6111	6111	Lionel	419	" I am so glad to think that . It alters the whole case , you see , Vance . "
6136	6148	6150	6150	Vance	425	" It do n't alter the case of the three pounds , "
6152	6203	6150	6150	Vance	425	" What 's her grandfather to me , that I should give his grandchild three pounds , when any other child in the village would have leaped out of her skin to have her face upon my sketch - book and five shillings in her pocket ? Hang her grandfather ! "
6257	6261	6262	6262	he	420	" Young master , "
6265	6356	6262	6262	he	420	" it is now just four years ago , when Mr. Rugge , coming here , as he and his troop had done at fair - time ever sin ' I can mind of , brought with him the man you have seen to - night , William Waife ; I calls him Gentleman Waife . However that man fell into sick straits , how he came to join sich a caravan , would puzzle most heads . It puzzles Joe Spruce , uncommon ; it do n't puzzle me . "
6357	6360	6362	6362	Vance	425	" Why ? "
6364	6369	6262	6262	he	420	" Cos of Saturn ! "
6370	6373	6262	6262	he	420	" Satan ? "
6374	6406	6262	6262	he	420	" Saturn , - dead agin his Second and Tenth House , I 'll swear . Lord of Ascendant , mayhap ; in combustion of the Sun , - who knows ? "
6407	6414	6416	6416	Vance	425	" You 're not an astrologer ? "
6423	6431	6262	6262	he	420	" Bit of it ; no offence . "
6432	6438	6440	6440	Lionel	419	" What does it signify ? "
6444	6479	6440	6440	Lionel	419	" go on . So you called Mr. Waife ' Gentleman Waife ; ' and if you had not been an astrologer you would have been puzzled to see him in such a calling . "
6480	6809	6262	6262	he	420	" Ay , that 's it ; for he warn't like any as we ever see on these boards hereabouts ; and yet he warn't exactly like a Lunnon actor , as I have seen 'em in Lunnon , either , but more like a clever fellow who acted for the spree of the thing . He had sich droll jests , and looked so comical , yet not commonlike , but always what I calls a gentleman , - just as if one o ' ye two were doing a bit of sport to please your friends . Well , he drew hugely , and so he did , every time he came , so that the great families in the neighbourhood would go to hear him ; and he lodged in my house , and had pleasant ways with him , and was what I call a scollard . But still I do n't want to deceive ye , and I should judge him to have been a wild dog in his day . Mercury ill - aspected , - not a doubt of it . Last year it so happened that one of the great gents who belong to a Lunnon theatre was here at fair - time . Whether he had heard of Waife chanceways , and come express to judge for hisself , I ca n't say ; like eno ' . And when he had seen Gentleman Waife act , he sent for him to the inn - Red Lion - and offered him a power o ' money to go to Lunnon , - Common Garden . Well , sir , Waife did not take to it all at once , but hemmed and hawed , and was at last quite coaxed into it , and so he went . But bad luck came on it ; and I knew there would , for I saw it all in my crystal . "
6810	6813	6815	6815	Vance	425	" Oh , "
6817	6847	6815	6815	Vance	425	" a crystal , too ; really it is getting late , and if you had your crystal about you , you might see that we want to sup . "
6848	6852	6854	6854	Lionel	419	" What happened ? "
6883	6982	6262	6262	he	420	" What happened ? why , just what I foreseed . There was an accident in the railway ' tween this and Lunnon , and poor Waife lost an eye , and was a cripple for life : so he could not go on the Lunnon stage at all ; and what was worse , he was a long time atwixt life and death , and got summat bad on his chest wi ' catching cold , and lost his voice , and became the sad object you have gazed on , young happy things that ye are . "
6983	6996	6998	6998	Vance	425	" But he got some compensation from the railway , I suppose ? "
7009	7148	6262	6262	he	420	" He did , and spent it . I suppose the gentleman broke out in him as soon as he had money , and , ill though he was , the money went . Then it seems he had no help for it but to try and get back to Mr. Rugge . But Mr. Rugge was sore and spiteful at his leaving ; for Rugge counted on him , and had even thought of taking the huge theatre at York , and bringing out Gentleman Waife as his trump card . But it warn't fated , and Rugge thought himself ill - used , and so at first he would have nothing more to say to Waife . And truth is , what could the poor man do for Rugge ? But then Waife produces little Sophy . "
7149	7155	7157	7157	Vance	425	" You mean Juliet Araminta ? "
7159	7219	6262	6262	he	420	" Same - in private life she be Sophy . And Waife taught her to act , and put together the plays for her . And Rugge caught at her ; and she supports Waife with what she gets ; for Rugge only gives him four shillings a week , and that goes on ' baccy and such like . "
7220	7229	7231	7231	Vance	425	" Such like - drink , I presume ? "
7233	7347	6262	6262	he	420	" No - he do n't drink . But he do smoke , and he has little genteel ways with him , and four shillings goes on 'em . And they have been about the country this spring , and done well , and now they be here . But Rugge behaves shocking hard to both on 'em : and I do n't believe he has any right to her in law , as he pretends , - only a sort of understanding which she and her grandfather could break if they pleased ; and that 's what they wish to do , and that 's why little Sophy wants the three pounds . "
7348	7351	7353	7353	Lionel	419	" How ? "
7357	7383	7353	7353	Lionel	419	" If they had three pounds could they get away ? and if they did , how could they live ? Where could they go ? "
7384	7485	6262	6262	he	420	" That 's their secret . But I heard Waife say - the first night they came here - I that if he could get three pounds , he had hit on a plan to be independent like . I tell you what put his back up : it was Rugge insisting on his coming on the stage agin , for he did not like to be seen such a wreck . But he was forced to give in ; and so he contrived to cut up that play - story , and appear hisself at the last without speaking . "
7486	7491	7493	7494	young Lionel	419	" My good friend , "
7496	7530	7493	7494	young Lionel	419	" we are greatly obliged to you for your story ; and we should much like to see little Sophy and her grandfather at your house to - morrow , - can we ? "
7531	7551	6262	6262	he	420	" Certain sure you can , after the play 's over ; to - night , if you like . "
7552	7577	7493	7494	young Lionel	419	" No , to - morrow : you see my friend is impatient to get back now ; we will call to - morrow . "
7578	7589	7591	7592	the Cobbler	1317	" ' T is the last day of their stay , "
7594	7623	7591	7592	the Cobbler	1317	" But you ca n't be sure to see them safely at my house afore ten o'clock at night ; and not a word to Rugge ! mum ! "
7624	7631	7633	7633	Lionel	419	" Not a word to Rugge , "
7635	7642	7633	7633	Lionel	419	" good - night to you . "
7669	7680	7682	7682	Lionel	419	" It is I who have had the talk now , "
7758	7771	7772	7773	a wag	1501	" that they were quite welcome to any joke at his expense , "
7777	7801	7772	7773	a wag	1501	" At your expense ! Do n't fear ; if a joke were worth a farthing , you would never give that permission . "
7842	7853	7831	7831	Lionel	419	" It is I who have all the talk now ! "
7854	7857	7860	7860	Vance	443	" Naturally , "
7862	7898	7860	7860	Vance	443	" naturally you have , for it is you , I suspect , who alone have the intention to pay for it , and three pounds appear to be the price . Dearish , eh ? "
7899	7910	7831	7831	Lionel	419	" Ah , Vance , if I had three pounds ! "
7911	7931	7860	7860	Vance	443	" Tush ; and say no more till we have supped . I have the hunger of a wolf . "
8037	8045	8047	8047	Vance	443	" Supper and lights in the arbour , "
8054	8083	8047	8047	Vance	443	" hey , presto , quick ! while we turn in to wash our hands . And hark ! a quart jug of that capital whiskey - toddy . "
8168	8172	8174	8174	he	443	" After all , "
8176	8197	8174	8174	he	443	" I am glad I am a painter ; and I hope I may live to be a great one . "

8275	8308	8267	8267	Lionel	419	" must you feel who can fix a fading sunshine - a fleeting face - on a scrap of canvas , and say ' Sunshine and Beauty , live there forever ! ' "
8312	8398	8309	8309	VANCE	443	" Forever ! no ! Colours perish , canvas rots . What remains to us of Zeuxis ? Still it is prettily said on behalf of the poetic side of the profession ; there is a prosaic one ; - we 'll blink it . Yes ; I am glad to be a painter . But you must not catch the fever of my calling . Your poor mother would never forgive me if she thought I had made you a dauber by my example . "
8403	8455	8399	8399	LIONEL	419	" No . I shall not be a painter ! But what can I be ? How shall I ever build on the earth one of the castles I have built in the air ? Fame looks so far , - Fortune so impossible . But one thing I am bent upon "
8464	8477	8399	8399	LIONEL	419	" I will gain an independence somehow , and support my mother . "
8481	8492	8478	8478	VANCE	443	" Your mother is supported : she has the pension - "
8496	8504	8505	8505	he	419	" Of a captain 's widow ; and "
8511	8521	8505	8505	he	419	" a first floor that she lets to lodgers . "
8525	8671	8673	8673	Vance	443	" No shame in that ! Peers let houses ; and on the Continent , princes let not only first floors , but fifth and sixth floors , to say nothing of attics and cellars . In beginning the world , friend Lionel , if you do n't wish to get chafed at every turn , fold up your pride carefully , put it under lock and key , and only let it out to air upon grand occasions . Pride is a garment all stiff brocade outside , all grating sackcloth on the side next to the skin . Even kings do n't wear the dalmaticum except at a coronation . Independence you desire ; good . But are you dependent now ? Your mother has given you an excellent education , and you have already put it to profit . My dear boy , "
8679	8791	8673	8673	Vance	443	" I honour you ; at your age , on leaving school , to have shut yourself up , translated Greek and Latin per sheet for a bookseller , at less than a valet 's wages , and all for the purpose of buying comforts for your mother ; and having a few pounds in your own pockets , to rove your little holiday with me and pay your share of the costs ! Ah , there are energy and spirit and life in all that , Lionel , which will found upon rock some castle as fine as any you have built in air . Your hand , my boy . "
8836	8883	8833	8833	He	419	" I do n't deserve your praise , Vance , and I fear the pride you tell me to put under lock and key has the larger share of the merit you ascribe to better motives . Independent ? No ! I have never been so . "
8887	8903	8884	8884	VANCE	425	" Well , you depend on a parent : who , at seventeen does not ? "
8907	9037	8904	8904	LIONEL	419	" I did not mean my mother ; of course , I could not be too proud to take benefits from her . But the truth is simply this - , my father had a relation , not very near , indeed , - a cousin , at about as distant a remove , I fancy , as a cousin well can be . To this gentleman my mother wrote when my poor father died ; and he was generous , for it is he who paid for my schooling . I did not know this till very lately . I had a vague impression , indeed , that I had a powerful and wealthy kinsman who took an interest in me , but whom I had never seen . "
9041	9045	9038	9038	VANCE	425	" Never seen ? "
9049	9115	9046	9046	LIONEL	419	" No . And here comes the sting . On leaving school last Christmas , my mother , for the first time , told me the extent of my obligations to this benefactor , and informed me that he wished to know my own choice as to a profession , - that if I preferred Church or Bar , he would maintain me at college . "
9119	9148	9116	9116	VANCE	425	" Body o ' me ! where 's the sting in that ? Help yourself to toddy , my boy , and take more genial views of life . "
9152	9292	9149	9149	LIONEL	419	" You have not heard me out . I then asked to see my benefactor 's letters ; and my mother , unconscious of the pain she was about to inflict , showed me not only the last one , but all she had received from him . Oh , Vance , they were terrible , those letters ! The first began by a dry acquiescence in the claims of kindred , a curt proposal to pay my schooling ; but not one word of kindness , and a stern proviso that the writer was never to see nor hear from me . He wanted no gratitude ; he disbelieved in all professions of it . His favours would cease if I molested him . ' Molested ' was the word ; it was bread thrown to a dog . "
9296	9312	9293	9293	VANCE	425	" Tut ! Only a rich man 's eccentricity . A bachelor , I presume ? "
9316	9330	9313	9313	LIONEL	419	" My mother says he has been married , and is a widower . "
9334	9338	9331	9331	VANCE	425	" Any children ? "
9342	9359	9339	9339	LIONEL	419	" My mother says none living ; but I know little or nothing about his family . "
9383	9473	9360	9360	Vance	425	" Plain as a pikestaff . Your relation is one of those men who , having no children , suspect and dread the attention of an heir presumptive ; and what has made this sting , as you call it , keener to you is - pardon me - is in some silly words of your mother , who , in showing you the letters , has hinted to you that that heir you might be , if you were sufficiently pliant and subservient . Am I not right ? "
9486	9508	9482	9482	VANCE	425	" So , so ; no great harm as yet . Enough of the first letter . What was the last ? "
9512	9626	9509	9509	LIONEL	419	" Still more offensive . He , this kinsman , this patron , desired my mother to spare him those references to her son 's ability and promise , which , though natural to herself , had slight interest to him , - him , the condescending benefactor ! As to his opinion , what could I care for the opinion of one I had never seen ? All that could sensibly affect my - oh , but I can not go on with those cutting phrases , which imply but this , ' All I can care for is the money of a man who insults me while he gives it . ' "
9631	9664	9627	9627	VANCE	425	" Without being a wizard , I should say your relative was rather a disagreeable person , - not what is called urbane and amiable , - in fact , a brute . "
9668	9836	9665	9665	LIONEL	419	" You will not blame me , then , when I tell you that I resolved not to accept the offer to maintain me at college , with which the letter closed . Luckily Dr. Wallis the head master of my school , who had always been very kind to me , had just undertaken to supervise a popular translation of the classics . He recommended me , at my request , to the publisher engaged in the undertaking , as not incapable of translating some of the less difficult Latin authors , - subject to his corrections . When I had finished the first instalment of the work thus intrusted to me , my mother grew alarmed for my health , and insisted on my taking some recreation . You were about to set out on a pedestrian tour . I had , as you say , some pounds in my pocket ; and thus I have passed with you the merriest days of my life . "
9840	9858	9837	9837	VANCE	425	" What said your civil cousin when your refusal to go to college was conveyed to him ? "
9862	9994	9859	9859	LIONEL	419	" He did not answer my mother 's communication to that effect till just before I left home , and then , - no , it was not his last letter from which I repeated that withering extract , - no , the last was more galling still , for in it he said that if , in spite of the ability and promise that had been so vaunted , the dulness of a college and the labour of learned professions were so distasteful to me , he had no desire to dictate to my choice , but that as he did not wish one who was , however remotely , of his blood , and bore the name of Haughton , to turn shoeblack or pickpocket - Vance - Vance ! "
9998	10018	9995	9995	VANCE	425	" Lock up your pride - the sackcloth frets you - and go on ; and that therefore he - "
10022	10040	10019	10019	LIONEL	419	" Would buy me a commission in the army , or get me an appointment in India . "
10044	10050	10041	10041	VANCE	425	" Which did you take ? "
10054	10198	10051	10051	LIONEL	419	" Which ! so offered , - which ? - of course neither ! But distrusting the tone of my mother 's reply , I sat down , the evening before I left home , and wrote myself to this cruel man . I did not show any letter to my mother , - did not tell her of it . I wrote shortly , - that if he would not accept my gratitude , I would not accept his benefits ; that shoeblack I might be , - pickpocket , no ! that he need not fear I should disgrace his blood or my name ; and that I would not rest till , sooner or later , I had paid him back all that I had cost him , and felt relieved from the burdens of an obligation which - which - "

See , just where we stand , how the slight pebbles are fretting the wave would the wave if not fretted make that pleasant music ? A few miles farther on , and the river is spanned by a bridge , which busy feet now are crossing : by the side of that bridge now is rising a palace ; all the men who rule England have room in that palace . At the rear of the palace soars up the old Abbey where kings have their tombs in right of the names they inherit ; men , lowly as we , have found tombs there , in right of the names which they made . Think , now , that you stand on that bridge with a boy 's lofty hope , with a man 's steadfast courage ; then turn again to that stream , calm with starlight , flowing on towards the bridge , - spite of islet and pebbles .

10743	10858	10739	10739	LIONEL	419	" Nay , I see nothing so wonderful in the story , though much that is sad . You must allow that Waife may have been a good actor : you became quite excited merely at his attitude and bow . Natural , therefore , that he should have been invited to try his chance on the London stage ; not improbable that he may have met with an accident by the train , and so lost his chance forever ; natural , then , that he should press into service his poor little grandchild , natural , also , that , hardly treated and his pride hurt , he should wish to escape . "
10862	10936	10859	10859	VANCE	443	" And more natural than all that he should want to extract from our pockets three pounds , the Bandit ! No , Lionel , I tell you what is not probable , that he should have disposed of that clever child to a vagabond like Rugge : she plays admirably . The manager who was to have engaged him would have engaged her if he had seen her . I am puzzled . "
10940	10959	10937	10937	LIONEL	419	" True , she is an extraordinary child . I can not say how she has interested me . "

11059	11148	11150	11150	Vance	443	" Borrow from me , Cato ! That comes of falling in with bandits and their children . No ; but let us look at the thing like men of sense . One story is good till another is told . I will call by myself on Rugge to - morrow , and hear what he says ; and then , if we judge favourably of the Cobbler 's version , we will go at night and talk with the Cobbler 's lodgers ; and I dare say , "

Put thy hands from thy mouth ; sit down , darling , there , opposite , and let us talk . Now , Sophy , thou hast often said that thou wouldst be glad to be out of this mode of life , even for one humbler and harder : think well , is it so ? "

"
12805	12812	12814	12815	little Sophy	442	" It would be so nice ! "

12982	13153	12980	12980	Sophy	442	" I will tell you , Grandy , what would make it nice : no one would vex and affront you , - we should be all by ourselves ; and then , instead of those nasty lamps and those dreadful painted creatures , we could go out and play in the fields and gather daisies ; and I could run after butterflies , and when I am tired I should come here , where I am now , any time of the day , and you would tell me stories and pretty verses , and teach me to write a little better than I do now , and make such a wise little woman of me ; and if I wore gingham - but it need not be dingy , Grandy - it would be all mine , and you would be all mine too , and we 'd keep a bird , and you 'd teach it to sing ; and oh , would it not be nice ! "
13154	13246	13435	13435	Sophy	442	" But still , Sophy , we should have to live , and we could not live upon daisies and butterflies . And I ca n't work now ; for the matter of that , I never could work : more shame for me , but so it is . Merle says the fault is in the stars , - with all my heart . But the stars will not go to the jail or the workhouse instead of me . And though they want nothing to eat , we do . "

13288	13347	13435	13435	Sophy	442	" A fortune ! - that 's a strong word : let it stand . A fortune ! But still , Sophy , though we should be free of this thrice - execrable Rugge , the scheme I have in my head lies remote from daisies and butterflies . We should have to dwell in towns and exhibit !

13617	13688	13614	13615	Mr. Waife	433	" it is no use pampering ourselves with vain hopes : the three pounds are not forthcoming . You heard what that brute Rugge said , that the gentleman who wanted to take your portrait had called on him this morning , and offered 10s . for a sitting , - that is , 5s . for you , 5s . for Rugge ; and Rugge thought the terms reasonable .

14785	14816	14779	14779	SOPHY	442	" That is the young gentleman - the very young one , I mean - with the kind eyes ; is he coming ? - is he , is he ? "

15030	15048	15027	15027	COBBLER	420	" Pooh ! worth a hundred times three pounds ; the gift , - the spirituous gift . "
15052	15066	15049	15049	WAIFE	442	" Spirituous ! do n't like the epithet , - smells of gin ! "
15070	15090	15067	15067	COBBLER	420	" Spirituous gift to see in the crystal : if she had that , she might make your fortune . "
15101	15127	15091	15091	WAIFE	442	" Ah ! I never thought of that . But if she has not the gift , I could teach it her , - eh ? "
15132	15204	15128	15128	COBBLER	420	" I did not think to hear this from you , Mr. Waife . Teach her , - you ! make her an impostor , and of the wickedest kind , inventing lies between earth and them as dwell in the seven spheres ! Fie ! No , if she has n't the gift natural , let her alone : what here is not heaven - sent is devil - taught . "
15212	15229	15205	15205	WAIFE	433	" Then you really think you saw all that you described , in that glass egg ? "

16056	16097	16098	16099	The Comedian	1587	" My grandchild declined your flattering proposal with my full approbation . She did not consider - neither did I - that the managerial rights of Mr. Rugge entitled him to the moiety of her face - off the stage . "
16124	16138	16098	16099	The Comedian	1587	" ' My face is my fortune , sir , ' she said . "

16203	16223	16200	16200	VANCE	443	" Certainly not . Why did you not introduce her to the London Manager who would have engaged yourself ? "
16234	16304	16224	16224	Waife	442	" How do I know she would have succeeded ? She had never then trod the boards . Besides , what strikes you as so good in a village show may be poor enough in a metropolitan theatre . Gentlemen , I do my best for her ; you can not think otherwise , since she maintains me ! I am no OEdipus , yet she is my Antigone . "
16308	16337	16305	16305	VANCE	443	" You know the classics , sir . Mr. Merle said you were a scholar ! - read Sophocles in his native Greek , I presume , sir ? "
16343	16356	16338	16340	MR . WAIFE	433	" You jeer at the unfortunate : I am used to it . "

16408	16598	16403	16405	MR . WAIFE	433	" Sir , you say you are an artist . Have you heard no tales of your professional brethren , - men of genius the highest , who won fame , which I never did , and failed of fortunes , as I have done ? Their own fault , perhaps , - improvidence , wild habits , ignorance of the way how to treat life and deal with their fellow - men ; such fault may have been mine too . I suffer for it : no matter ; I ask none to save me . You are a painter : you would place her features on your canvas ; you would have her rank amongst your own creations . She may become a part of your immortality . Princes may gaze on the effigies of the innocent happy childhood , to which your colours lend imperishable glow . They may ask who and what was this fair creature ? Will you answer , ' One whom I found in tinsel , and so left , sure that she would die in rags ! ' - Save her ! "

16728	16736	16708	16708	Sophy	442	" Three pounds - three - three . "
16737	16794	16795	16795	WAIFE	442	" You shall have them . But listen : I meant only to take a sketch ; I must now have a finished portrait . I can not take this by candlelight . You must let me come here to - morrow ; and yet to - morrow , I understand , you meant to leave ? "
16798	16835	16795	16795	WAIFE	442	" If you will generously bestow on us the sum you say , we shall not leave the village till you have completed your picture . It is Mr. Rugge and his company we will leave . "
16839	16900	16836	16836	VANCE	443	" And may I venture to ask what you propose to do , towards a new livelihood for yourself and your grandchild , by the help of a sum which is certainly much for me to pay , - enormous , I might say , quoad me , - but small for a capital whereon to set up a business ? "
16904	16958	16901	16901	WAIFE	442	" Excuse me if I do not answer that very natural question at present . Let me assure you that that precise sum is wanted for an investment which promises her and myself an easy existence . But to insure my scheme , I must keep it secret . Do you believe me ? "
16959	16963	16965	16965	Lionel	419	" I do ! "
16989	16999	17001	17001	Vance	443	" There is your money , sir , beforehand , "
17019	17026	17028	17028	Waife	442	" And how do you know , "
17032	17049	17028	17028	Waife	442	" that I may not be off to - night with your money and your model ! "
17050	17053	17055	17055	Vance	443	" Well , "
17059	17081	17055	17055	Vance	443	" I think it is on the cards . Still , as John Kemble said when rebuked for too large an alms ,
17082	17105	17028	17028	Waife	442	" ' It is not often that I do these things , But when I do , I do them handsomely . ' "
17106	17116	17118	17119	the Comedian	1587	" Well applied , and well delivered , sir , "
17121	17135	17118	17119	the Comedian	1587	" only you should put a little more emphasis on the word do . "
17136	17159	17028	17028	Waife	442	" Did I not put enough ? I am sure I felt it strongly ; no one can feel the do more ! "
17193	17342	17183	17183	he	1657	" No , sir , not a shilling till the picture is completed . Nay , to relieve your mind , I will own that , had I no scruple more delicate , I would rather receive nothing till Mr. Rugge is gone . True , he has no right to any share in it . But you see before you a man who , when it comes to arguing , could never take a wrangler 's degree , - never get over the Asses ' Bridge , sir . Plucked at it scores of times clean as a feather . But do not go yet . You came to give us money : give us what , were I rich , I should value more highly , - a little of your time . You , sir , are an artist ; and you , young gentleman ? "
17350	17358	17346	17346	LIONEL	419	" I - am nothing as yet . "
17362	17416	17359	17359	WAIFE	442	" You are fond of the drama , I presume , both of you ? Apropos of John Kemble , you , sir , said that you have never heard him . Allow me , so far as this cracked voice can do it , to give you a faint idea of him . "
17417	17423	17425	17425	Vance	443	" I shall be delighted , "
17440	17458	17425	17425	Vance	443	" But since I see you smoke , may I take the liberty to light my cigar ? "
17459	17465	17467	17468	Gentleman Waife	433	" Make yourself at home , "
17598	17603	17605	17606	the Comedian	1587	" Merle , Merle ! "
17616	17676	17613	17613	Merle	435	" We do n't go to - morrow . When Rugge sends for us as he will do at daybreak , say so . You shall lodge us a few days longer , and then - and then - my little Sophy , kiss me , kiss me ! You are saved at least from those horrid painted creatures ! "
17677	17682	17684	17684	Merle	435	" Ah , ah ! "
17688	17702	17703	17703	he	435	" he has got the money ! Glad to hear it . But , "
17723	17743	17703	17703	he	435	" that 's not it . The true horary question , is , WHAT WILL HE DO WITH IT ? "
17770	17773	17776	17776	his	1667	" to progress "

18722	18739	18705	18706	Mr. Rugge	438	" Rebellious , eh ? - wo n't come ? Where 's your grandfather , baggage ? "
18758	18766	18767	18767	SOPHY	442	" Your vile scamp of a grandfather ? "
18772	18791	18767	18767	SOPHY	442	" He is not vile . You ought to be ashamed of yourself speaking so , Mr. Rugge ! "
18872	18886	18856	18856	his	420	" Civil words to my lodgers , master , or out you go ! "
18918	18935	18904	18904	he	11136	" I have something to say to you ; shall I say it before your landlord ? "
18945	18965	18966	18966	Rugge	438	" Leave us , my friend ; I shall not require you . Step this way , Mr. Rugge . "

18991	19054	18988	18988	his	1317	" I do n't quite take your grandfather 's giving in . British ground here ! But your Ascendant can not surely be in such malignant conjunction with that obstreperous tyrant as to bind you to him hand and foot . Let 's see what the crystal thinks of it . ' Take it up gently , and come downstairs with me . "
19055	19066	19068	19068	Sophy	442	" Please , no ; I 'll stay near Grandfather , "
19072	19083	19068	19068	Sophy	442	" He sha'n't be left helpless with that rude man . "

19100	19148	19149	19149	He	420	" you have a spirit of your own , and if you were my wife I should be afraid of you . But I wo n't stand here eavesdropping ; mayhap your grandfather has secrets I 'm not to hear : call me if I 'm wanted . "
19296	19302	19304	19305	Mr. Rugge	438	" Am I to understand , "
19345	19390	19312	19312	Waife	442	" am I to understand that , after my taking you and that child to my theatre out of charity , and at your own request , you are going to quit me without warning , - French leave ; is that British conduct ? "
19391	19395	19397	19397	Waife	442	" Mr. Rugge , "
19401	19449	19397	19397	Waife	442	" I have no engagement with you beyond an experimental trial . We were free on both sides for three months , - you to dismiss us any day , we to leave you . The experiment does not please us : we thank you and depart . "
19453	19606	19607	19607	Waife	442	" That is not the truth . I said I was free to dismiss you both , if the child did not suit . You , poor helpless creature , could be of no use . But I never heard you say you were to be free too . Stands to reason not ! Put my engagements at a Waife 's mercy ! I , Lorenzo Rugge ! - stuff ! But I am a just man , and a liberal man , and if you think you ought to have a higher salary , if this ungrateful proceeding is only , as I take it , a strike for wages , I will meet you . Juliet Araminta does play better than I could have supposed ; and I 'll conclude an engagement on good terms , as we were to have done if the experiment answered , for three years . "
19612	19656	19658	19659	the actor	1644	" You are very good , Mr. Rugge , but it is not a strike . My little girl does not like the life at any price ; and , since she supports me , I am bound to please her . Besides , "
19666	19754	19658	19659	the actor	1644	" you have broken faith with me . It was fully understood that I was to appear no more on your stage ; all my task was to advise with you in the performances , remodel the plays , help in the stage - management ; and you took advantage of my penury , and , when I asked for a small advance , insisted on forcing these relics of what I was upon the public pity . Enough : we part . I bear no malice . "
19758	19793	19755	19755	RUGGE	438	" Oh , do n't you ? No more do I. But I am a Briton , and I have the spirit of one . You had better not make an enemy of me . "
19797	19816	19794	19794	WAIFE	442	" I am above the necessity of making enemies . I have an enemy ready made in myself . "
19829	19856	19817	19817	Rugge	438	" I dare say you have ! A bad conscience , sir . How would you like your past life looked into , and blabbed out ? "
19862	19902	19857	19858	GENTLEMAN WAIFE	433	" The last four years of it have been spent in your service , Mr. Rugge . If their record had been blabbed out for my benefit , there would not have been a dry eye in the house . "
19905	19984	19903	19903	RUGGE	438	" I disdain your sneer . When a scorpion nursed at my bosom sneers at me , I leave it to its own reflections . But I do n't speak of the years in which that scorpion has been enjoying a salary and smoking canaster at my expense . I refer to an earlier dodge in its checkered existence . Ha , sir , you wince ! I suspect I can find out something about you which would - "
19989	19993	19985	19985	WAIFE	433	" Would what ? "
19997	20073	19994	19994	RUGGE	438	" Oh , lower your tone , sir ; no bullying me . I suspect ! I have good reason for suspicion ; and if you sneak off in this way , and cheat me out of my property in Juliet Araminta , I will leave no stone unturned to prove what I suspect : look to it , slight man ! Come , I do n't wish to quarrel ; make it up , and "
20080	20135	19994	19994	RUGGE	438	" if you want cash down , and will have an engagement in black and white for three years for Juliet Araminta , you may squeeze a good sum out of me , and go yourself where you please : you 'll never be troubled by me . What I want is the girl . "
20146	20160	20142	20142	Waife	433	" And hang me ; sir , if you shall have the girl ! "
20313	20316	20318	20318	he	438	" Bravo ! "
20322	20383	20318	20318	he	438	" Come , come , Waife , look at her : she was born for the stage . My heart swells with pride . She is my property , morally speaking ; make her so legally ; and hark , in your ear , fifty pounds . Take me in the humour , - Golconda opens , - fifty pounds ! "
20384	20387	20389	20390	the vagrant	1734	" No , "
20392	20395	20397	20397	Rugge	438	" Well , "
20401	20408	20397	20397	Rugge	438	" let her speak for herself . "
20409	20437	20508	20508	he	1477	" Speak , child . You do n't wish to return to Mr. Rugge , - and without me , too , - do you , Sophy ? "
20438	20450	20397	20397	Rugge	438	" Without you , Grandy ! I 'd rather die first . "
20451	20491	20508	20508	he	1477	" You hear her ; all is settled between us . You have had our services up to last night ; you have paid us up to last night ; and so good morning to you , Mr. Rugge . "
20492	20497	20499	20500	the manager	1477	" My dear child , "
20511	20710	20508	20508	he	1477	" do consider . You shall be so made of without that stupid old man . You think me cross , but ' t is he who irritates and puts me out of temper . I ' m uncommon fond of children . I had a babe of my own once , - upon my honour , I had , - and if it had not been for convulsions , caused by teething , I should be a father still . Supply to me the place of that beloved babe . You shall have such fine dresses ; all new , - choose 'em yourself , - minced veal and raspberry tarts for dinner every Sunday . In three years , under my care , you will become a great actress , and make your fortune , and marry a lord , - lords go out of their wits for great actresses , - whereas , with him , what will you do ? drudge and rot and starve ; and he ca n't live long , and then where will you be ? ' T is a shame to hold her so , you idle old vagabond . "
20711	20718	20720	20720	Waife	442	" I do n't hold her , "

By the by , as you are going to the post - office here for the letter you expect from your mother , ask for my letters too . You will take care of little Sophy , and in a whisper hurry her out of the garden , or that Grand Mogul feminine , Lady Selina , whose condescension would crush the Andes , will be stopping her as my protege , falling in raptures with that horrid coloured print , saying , ' Dear , what pretty sprigs ! where can such things be got ? ' and learning perhaps how Frank Vance saved the Bandit 's Child from the Remorseless Baron . ' T is your turn now . Save your friend . The Baron was a lamb compared to a fine lady . "

28305	28381	28301	28302	LADY SELINA	500	" Lawyer - true ; now I think of it , he was a lawyer . But his chief fame was in the House of Commons . All parties agreed that he might have commanded any station ; but he was too rich perhaps to care sufficiently about office . At all events , Parliament was dissolved when he was at the height of his reputation , and he refused to be re - elected . "
28420	28440	28549	28550	LADY FROST	502	" I have heard of him . Before my time ; lawyers not much weight in the House now . "
28445	28548	28441	28442	LADY SELINA	500	" I am told that Mr. Darrell did not speak like a lawyer . But his career is over ; lives in the country , and sees nobody ; a thousand pities ; a connection of mine , too ; great loss to the country . Ask your young friend , Mr. Vance , if Mr. Darrell is not his relation . I hope so , for his sake . Now that our party is in power , Mr. Darrell could command anything for others , though he has ceased to act with us . Our party is not forgetful of talent . "
28556	28572	28549	28550	LADY FROST	502	" I should think not : it has so little of that kind to remember . "

I enclose a reply to himself , which I beg you will give to his own hands without breaking the seal . Since it did not seem to you indiscreet to communicate to a boy of his years letters written solely to yourself , you can not blame me if I take your implied estimate of his capacity to judge for himself of the nature of a correspondence , and of the views and temper of , madam , your very obedient servant .

31325	31357	31318	31318	Waife	442	" Enough of that , Sophy ; looking after young men is not proper ! What does he mean about ' seeing each other , and giving me his address ' ? "
31358	31374	31318	31318	Waife	442	" He wished me to write to him sometimes and he would write to me . "
31614	31621	31686	31686	Vance	443	" to that sort of people . "

31962	32009	31959	31959	LIONEL	419	" No , I find I can get across the country , - two hours by the railway . There is a station at the town which bears the post - mark of the letter . I shall make for that , if you advise it . "
32010	32032	32144	32144	VANCE	443	" You knew I should advise it , or you would not have tortured your intellect by those researches into Bradshaw . "

32043	32055	32039	32039	Lionel	419	" but I wished for your sanction of my crude impressions . "
32056	32100	32144	32144	VANCE	443	" You never told me your cousin 's name was Darrell : not that I should have been much wiser if you had ; but , thunder and lightning , Lionel ! do you know that your cousin Darrell is a famous man ? "
32104	32143	32101	32101	LIONEL	419	" Famous ! - Nonsense . I suppose he was a good lawyer , for I have heard my mother say , with a sort of contempt , that he had made a great fortune at the bar . "
32147	32154	32144	32144	VANCE	443	" But he was in Parliament . "
32158	32167	32155	32155	LIONEL	419	" Was he ? I did not know . "
32171	32203	32168	32168	VANCE	443	" And this is senatorial fame ! You never heard your schoolfellows talk of Mr. Darrell ? - they would not have known his name if you had boasted of it ? "

32215	32239	32212	32212	VANCE	443	" Would your schoolfellows have known the names of Wilkie , of Landseer , of Turner , Maclise ? I speak of painters . "

32256	32611	32612	32612	Vance	425	" And yet Her Serene Sublimity - ship , Lady Selina Vipont , says to me with divine compassion , ' Not in the way of your delightful art to know such men as Mr. Darrell ! ' Oh , as if I did not see through it , too , when she said , a propos of my jean cap and velveteen jacket , ' What matters how you dress ? Every one knows who you are ! ' Would she have said that to the earl of Dunder , or even to Sir Gregory Stollhead ? No . I am the painter Frank Vance , - nothing more nor less ; and if I stood on my head in a check shirt and a sky - coloured apron , Lady Selina Vipont would kindly murmur , ' Only Frank Vance the painter : what does it signify ? ' Aha ! - and they think to put me to use , puppets and lay figures ! it is I who put them to use ! Hark ye , Lionel , you are nearer akin to these fine folks than I knew of . Promise me one thing : you may become of their set , by right of your famous Mr. Darrell ; if ever you hear an artist , musician , scribbler , no matter what , ridiculed as a tuft - hunter , - seeking the great , and so forth , - before you join in the laugh , ask some great man 's son , with a pedigree that dates from the Ark , ' Are you not a toad - eater too ? Do you want political influence ; do you stand contested elections ; do you curry and fawn upon greasy Sam the butcher and grimy Tom the blacksmith for a vote ? Why ? useful to your career , necessary to your ambition ? Aha ! is it meaner to curry and fawn upon white - handed women and elegant coxcombs ? Tut , tut ! useful to a career , necessary to ambition ! ' "
32684	32714	32680	32680	LIONEL	419	" No one , I am sure , could have meant to call you a tuft - hunter ; of course , every one knows that a great painter - "
32718	32748	32715	32715	VANCE	425	" Dates from Michael Angelo , if not from Zeuxis ! Common individuals trace their pedigree from their own fathers ! the children of Art from Art 's founders ! "
32796	32799	32801	32801	Lionel	419	" But , "
32814	32825	32801	32801	Lionel	419	" what has all this to do with Mr. Darrell ? "
32829	32900	32826	32826	VANCE	425	" Mr. Darrell might have been one of the first men in the kingdom . Lady Selina Vipout says so , and she is related , I believe , to every member in the Cabinet . Mr. Darrell can push you in life , and make your fortune , without any great trouble on your own part . Bless your stars , and rejoice that you are not a painter ! "
32912	32919	32901	32901	Lionel	419	" Vance , you are cruel ! "

33066	33069	33071	33071	Lionel	419	" What ! "
33075	33084	33071	33071	Lionel	419	" is Lady Selina Vipont so formidably rude ? "
33085	33104	32987	32988	the painter	1786	" Rude ! nobody is rude in that delightful set . Lady Selina Vipont is excruciatingly - civil . "

But he bought a good bit o ' land , too , some years ago , ten or twelve mile t ' other side o ' the county . First time you are going to Fawley , sir ? "
37184	37187	37368	37369	The driver	2161	" Yes . "
37188	37281	37090	37091	the driver	2161	" Ah ! I do n't mind seeing you afore ; and I should have known you if I had , for it is seldom indeed I have a fare to Fawley old Manor House . It must be , I take it , four or five years ago sin ' I wor there with a gent , and he went away while I wor feeding the horse ; did me out o ' my back fare . What bisness had he to walk when he came in my fly ? Shabby . "
37282	37295	37368	37369	The driver	2161	" Mr. Darrell lives very retired , then ? sees few persons ? "
37296	37322	37324	37325	the driver	2161	" S'pose so . I never seed him as I knows on ; see'd two o ' his hosses though , - rare good uns ; "

37982	38027	37959	37960	The driver	2161	" Yes ; Squire Darrell began to build that - many years ago - when I was a boy . I heerd say it was to be the show - house of the whole county . Been stopped these ten or a dozen years . "
38028	38036	37959	37960	The driver	2161	" Why ? - do you know ? "
38037	38186	37959	37960	The driver	2161	" No one knows . Squire was a laryer , I b'leve : perhaps he put it into Chancery . My wife 's grandfather was put into Chancery jist as he was growing up , and never grew afterwards : never got out o ' it ; nout ever does . There 's our churchwarden comes to me with a petition to sign agin the Pope . Says I , ' That old Pope is always in trouble : what 's he bin doin' now ? ' Says he , ' Spreading ! He 's a - got into Parlyment , and he 's now got a colledge , and we pays for it . I does n't know how to stop him . ' Says I , ' Put the Pope into Chancery , along with wife 's grandfather , and he 'll never spread agin . ' "

39283	39326	39357	39357	he	2230	" No , sir ; I found your letter yesterday at Hampton Court . I had been staying some days in that neighbourhood . I came on this morning : I was afraid too unceremoniously ; your kind welcome reassures me there . "
39386	39395	39381	39382	The servant	2194	" Let dinner be served within an hour . "
39396	39401	39403	39403	Lionel	419	" Pray , sir , "
39405	39415	39403	39403	Lionel	419	" do not change your hours on my account . "
39438	39496	39432	39434	the great man	2232	" All hours are the same to me ; and it were strange if a host could be deranged by consideration to his guest , - on the first day too . Are you tired ? Would you like to go to your room , or look out for half an hour ? The sky is clearing . "
39497	39508	39416	39417	Mr. Darrell	512	" I should so like to look out , sir . "
39509	39514	39432	39434	the great man	2232	" This way then . "
39688	39692	39694	39695	Mr. Darrell	512	" Amsterdam manners , "
39702	39778	39699	39699	his	512	" Here a former race heard music , sang glees , and smoked from clay pipes . That age soon passed , unsuited to English energies , which are not to be united with Holland phlegm ! But the view from the window - look out there . I wonder whether men in wigs and women in hoops enjoyed that . It is a mercy they did not clip those banks into a straight canal ! "
39809	39816	39818	39818	Lionel	419	" How Vance would enjoy this ! "
39820	39833	39818	39818	Lionel	419	" It would come into a picture even better than the Thames . "
39834	39841	40006	40006	celebrities	11904	" Vance ? who is Vance ? "
39842	39867	39818	39818	Lionel	419	" The artist , - a great friend of mine . Surely , sir , you have heard of him or seen his pictures ! "
39868	39901	40006	40006	celebrities	11904	" Himself and his pictures are since my time . Days tread down days for the recluse , and he forgets that celebrities rise with their suns , to wane with their moons ,
39902	39913	39818	39818	Lionel	419	" ' Truditur dies die , Novaeque pergunt interire lunae ' "
39914	39927	39929	39929	Lionel	419	" All suns do not set ; all moons do not wane ! "
39935	39978	39929	39929	Lionel	419	" When Horace speaks elsewhere of the Julian star , he compares it to a moon - ' inter ignes minores ' - and surely Fame is not among the orbs which ' pergunt interire , ' - hasten on to perish ! "
39979	39993	39995	39996	Mr. Darrell	512	" I am glad to see that you retain your recollections of Horace , "
40008	40023	40024	40024	he	512	" the most charming of all poets to a man of my years , and "
40028	40041	40024	40024	he	512	" the most useful for popular quotation to men at any age . "
40381	40388	40390	40390	he	512	" They come to be fed , "
40418	40433	40434	40434	Friends	1602	" He rose , uncovered , and bowed to the birds in mock courtesy : "

40468	40477	40463	40465	MR . DARRELL	512	" Rival ! - useful to my swans ? "
40482	40489	40478	40478	LIONEL	419	" Or to you , sir . "
40520	40529	40531	40531	Darrell	512	" Sonless , childless , hopeless , objectless ! "
40617	40627	40602	40602	she	2260	" I did not know you had deer here . "
40628	40655	40657	40657	Darrell	512	" Deer ! - in this little paddock ! - of course not ; only that doe . Fairthorn introduced her here . By the by , "
40678	40817	40657	40657	Darrell	512	" you were not aware that I have a brother hermit , - a companion be sides the swans and the doe . Dick Fairthorn is a year or two younger than myself , the son of my father 's bailiff . He was the cleverest boy at his grammar - school . Unluckily he took to the flute , and unfitted himself for the present century . He condescends , however , to act as my secretary , - a fair classical scholar , plays chess , is useful to me , - I am useful to him . We have an affection for each other . I never forgive any one who laughs at him . The half - hour bell , and you will meet him at dinner . Shall we come in and dress ? "
40835	40843	40823	40827	the same man - servant	2264	" Show Mr. Haughton to his room . "

41067	41074	41075	41075	he	419	" I have no dress things , "
41079	41089	41075	41075	he	419	" only a change of linen , and this , "
41117	41152	41100	41105	a most gentleman - like man	2277	" I will mention it to Mr. Darrell ; and if you will favour me with your address in London , I will send to telegraph for what you want against to - morrow . "
41153	41157	41159	41159	Lionel	419	" Many thanks , "
41167	41176	41159	41159	Lionel	419	" I will speak to Mr. Darrell myself . "
41177	41202	41100	41105	a most gentleman - like man	2277	" There is the hot water , sir ; that is the bell . I have the honour to be placed at your commands . "
41326	41338	41277	41277	his	419	" Durum ! sed fit levius Patientia Quicquid corrigere est nefas . "
41423	41428	41430	41431	his host	2287	" Say the truth , "
41433	41450	41430	41431	his host	2287	" you thought you were coming to an old churl , with whom ceremony was misplaced . "
41451	41455	41457	41457	Lionel	419	" Indeed no ! "
41459	41470	41457	41457	Lionel	419	" But - but I have so lately left school . "
41471	41480	41430	41431	his host	2287	" Your mother might have thought for you . "
41481	41501	41457	41457	Lionel	419	" I did not stay to consult her , indeed , sir ; I hope you are not offended . "
41502	41575	41430	41431	his host	2287	" No , but let me not offend you if I take advantage of my years and our relationship to remark that a young man should be careful not to let himself down below the standard of his own rank . If a king could bear to hear that he was only a ceremonial , a private gentleman may remember that there is but a ceremonial between himself and - his hatter ! "
41607	41655	41585	41585	Darrell	512	" It will be fair to - morrow : there is no mist on the hill yonder . Since you have a painter for a friend , perhaps you yourself are a draughtsman . There are some landscape effects here which Fairthorn shall point out to you . "
41656	41663	41665	41665	Lionel	419	" I fear , Mr. Darrell , "
41670	41680	41665	41665	Lionel	419	" that to - morrow I must leave you . "
41681	41696	41585	41585	Darrell	512	" So soon ? Well , I suppose the place must be very dull . "
41697	41740	41665	41665	Lionel	419	" Not that - not that ; but I have offended you , and I would not repeat the offence . I have not the ' ceremonial ' necessary to mark me as a gentleman , - either here or at home . "
41741	41752	41754	41754	Darrell	512	" So ! Bold frankness and ready wit command ceremonials , "
41767	41776	41761	41761	his	512	" Let me present to you Mr. Fairthorn , "
41848	41862	41864	41865	the host	2230	" Three minutes yet to dinner , and two before the lettercarrier goes , "
41872	41884	41869	41869	his	2230	" Mr. Fairthorn , will you write a note for me ? "
41915	41961	41894	41894	Darrell	512	" Another letter for the post , Mills : Mr. Fairthorn is sealing it . You are looking at my book - shelves , Lionel . As I understand that your master spoke highly of you , I presume that you are fond of reading . "
41962	41973	41975	41975	Lionel	419	" I think so , but I am not sure , "
41992	42011	41894	41894	Darrell	512	" You mean , perhaps , that you like reading , if you may choose your own books . "
42012	42037	41894	41894	Darrell	512	" Or rather , if I may choose my own time to read them , and that would not be on bright summer days . "
42038	42059	41894	41894	Darrell	512	" Without sacrificing bright summer days , one finds one has made little progress when the long winter nights come . "
42060	42175	41894	41894	Darrell	512	" Yes , sir . But must the sacrifice be paid in books ? I fancy I learned as much in the play - ground as I did n the schoolroom , and for the last few months , in much my own master , reading hard in the forenoon , it is true , for many hours at a stretch , and yet again for a few hours at evening , but rambling also through the streets , or listening to a few friends whom I have contrived to make , - I think , if I can boast of any progress at all , the books have the smaller share in it . "
42176	42191	41894	41894	Darrell	512	" You would , then , prefer an active life to a studious one ? "
42192	42199	41894	41894	Darrell	512	" Oh , yes - yes . "
42200	42205	42207	42210	the decorous Mr. Mills	571	" Dinner is served , "
42337	42344	42393	42393	Darrell	512	" non avium citharaeque cantus somnum reducent "
42444	42451	42428	42428	his	512	" Welcome here to a Haughton . "
42562	42567	42569	42569	he	419	" Surely , sir , "
42611	42611	42601	42601	you	419	"
42612	42635	42636	42636	Fairthorn	569	" Not I ; but I instructed myself as a judge of pictures , because at one time I was a collector . "
42644	42665	42636	42636	Fairthorn	569	" The rarest collection , - such Albert Durers ! such Holbeins ! and that head by Leonardo da Vinci ! "
42698	42705	42707	42707	Lionel	419	" Are they here , sir ? "
42807	42812	42822	42822	he	512	" Any more wine ? "
42834	42845	42822	42822	he	512	" Will you find a book for yourself , Lionel ? "
43060	43064	43052	43052	his	419	" Faerie Queene . "
43086	43093	43080	43080	Darrell	512	" Mr. Fairthorn , the flute ! "
43151	43155	43175	43175	Darrell	512	" Faerie Queene . "
43276	43288	43266	43266	Darrell	512	" Spenser ; you love him ! Do you write poetry ? "
43289	43299	43266	43266	Darrell	512	" No , sir : I only feel it ! "
43300	43304	43306	43307	the host	2230	" Do neither ! "
43357	43382	43346	43346	Fairthorn	569	" Oh , Mr. Fairthorn , how you have enchanted me ! I never believed the flute could have been capable of such effects ! "
43409	43417	43418	43418	he	569	" So you were pleased ! really ? "
43434	43451	43418	43418	he	569	" Pleased ! it is a cold word ! Who would not be more than pleased ? "
43452	43462	43418	43418	he	569	" You should hear me in the open air . "
43463	43473	43418	43418	he	569	" Let me do so - to - morrow . "
43474	43487	43418	43418	he	569	" My dear young sir , with all my heart . Hist ! "
43496	43568	43418	43418	he	569	" I like you . I wish him to like you . Answer all his questions as if you did not care how he turned you inside out . Never ask him a question , as if you sought to know what he did not himself confide . So there is some thing , you think , in a flute , after all ? There are people who prefer the fiddle . "
43569	43580	43581	43582	The musician	2328	" Then they never heard your flute , Mr. Fairthorn . "
43704	43724	43701	43702	Mr. Mills	571	" I humbly beg pardon : nine o'clock , sir , and the breakfast - bell going to ring . "
43760	43766	43768	43769	the host	2230	" Good morning , Lionel , "
43771	43817	43819	43819	Darrell	512	" No leave - taking to - day , as you threatened . I find you have made an appointment with Mr. Fairthorn , and I shall place you under his care . You may like to look over the old house , and make yourself "
43821	43825	43828	43829	Mr. Fairthorn	569	" at home , "
43872	43898	43900	43900	Darrell	512	" Mr. Fairthorn , in the capacity of my secretary , has learned to find me thoughts , and put them in his own words , "
43938	43948	43950	43950	Lionel	419	" You are a true diviner , Mr. Darrell , "
43952	43959	43950	43950	Lionel	419	" it is a glorious day . "
43960	43980	43981	43981	Darrell	512	" But there will be showers later . The fish are at play on the surface of the lake , "
43999	44050	43989	43989	Fairthorn	569	" After twelve , it will be just the weather for trout to rise ; and if you fish , Mr. Fairthorn will lend you a rod . He is a worthy successor of Izaak Walton , and loves a companion as Izaak did , but more rarely gets one . "
44051	44061	43950	43950	Lionel	419	" Are there trout in your lake , sir ? "
44062	44200	43989	43989	Fairthorn	569	" The lake ! You must not dream of invading that sacred water . The inhabitants of rivulets and brooks not within my boundary are beyond the pale of Fawley civilization , to be snared and slaughtered like Caifres , red men , or any other savages , for whom we bait with a missionary and whom we impale on a bayonet . But I regard my lake as a politic community , under the protection of the law , and leave its denizens to devour each other , as Europeans , fishes , and other cold - blooded creatures wisely do , in order to check the overgrowth of population . To fatten one pike it takes a great many minnows . Naturally I support the vested rights of pike . I have been a lawyer . "
44263	44273	44275	44276	the host	2230	" I am going to leave you , Lionel , "
44278	44306	44307	44307	He	2230	" to make - friends with Mr. Fairthorn , and I thus complete , according to my own original intention , the sentence which he diverted astray . "

45425	45431	45433	45433	Lionel	419	" I had no idea , "
45454	45466	45433	45433	Lionel	419	" I had no idea that my cousin was so young ! "
45467	45472	45474	45475	Mr. Fairthorn	569	" Oh , yes , "
45477	45488	45474	45475	Mr. Fairthorn	569	" he is only a year older than I am ! "
45489	45494	45496	45496	Lionel	419	" Older than you ! "
45511	45521	45496	45496	Lionel	419	" yet true , he told me so himself . "
45522	45532	45474	45475	Mr. Fairthorn	569	" And I am fifty - one last birthday . "
45533	45542	45496	45496	Lionel	419	" Mr. Darrell fifty - two ! Incredible ! "
45543	45560	45562	45563	Mr. Fairthorn	569	" I do n't know why we should ever grow old , the life we lead , "
45569	45632	45562	45563	Mr. Fairthorn	569	" Time stands so still ! Fishing , too , is very conducive to longevity . If you will follow me , we will get the rods ; and the flute , - you are quite sure you would like the flute ? Yes ! thank you , my dear young sir . And yet there are folks who prefer the fiddle ! "
45633	45663	45496	45496	Lionel	419	" Is not the sun a little too bright for the fly at present ; and will you not , in the meanwhile , show me over the house ? "
45664	45705	45562	45563	Mr. Fairthorn	569	" Very well ; not that this house has much worth seeing . The other indeed would have had a music - room ! But , after all , nothing like the open air for the flute . This way . "
46168	46174	46176	46176	Lionel	419	" I do n't wonder , "
46193	46219	46184	46184	he	419	" that Mr. Darrell began to build a new house . But it would have been a great pity to pull down this for it . "
46220	46254	46176	46176	Lionel	419	" Pull down this ! Do n't hint at such an idea to Mr. Darrell . He would as soon have pulled down the British Monarchy ! Nay , I suspect , sooner . "
46255	46269	46184	46184	he	419	" But the new building must surely have swallowed up the old one ? "
46270	46358	46176	46176	Lionel	419	" Oh , no ; Mr. Darrell had a plan by which he would have enclosed this separately in a kind of court , with an open screen - work or cloister ; and it was his intention to appropriate it entirely to mediaeval antiquities , of which he has a wonderful collection . He had a notion of illustrating every earlier reign in which his ancestors flourished , - different apartments in correspondence with different dates . It would have been a chronicle of national manners . "
46359	46378	46184	46184	he	419	" But , if it be not an impertinent question , where is this collection ? In London ? "
46379	46402	46176	46176	Lionel	419	" Hush ! hush ! I will give you a peep of some of the treasures , only do n't betray me . "
46548	46551	46552	46552	he	569	" Dangerous , "
46556	46573	46552	46552	he	569	" but one gets used to everything ! If you feel afraid , do n't venture ! "
46606	46612	46614	46615	Mr. Fairthorn	569	" Do n't touch me ! "
46619	46632	46634	46634	himself	419	" or we shall both be over . Now observe and imitate . "
46703	46708	46710	46710	Fairthorn	569	" Here we are , "
46712	46720	46722	46722	Lionel	419	" I do n't see the collection , "
46752	46761	46763	46763	Fairthorn	569	" Here are some , - most precious , "
46769	46845	46763	46763	Fairthorn	569	" Walled up , except where these boards , cased in iron , are nailed across , with a little door just big enough to creep through ; but that is locked , - Chubb 's lock , and Mr. Darrell keeps the key ! - treasures for a palace ! No , you ca n't peep through here - not a chink ; but come on a little further , - mind your footing . "
46974	47046	47152	47153	a wizard	11357	" These are the heavy things , and least costly things , that no one could well rob . The pictures here are merely curious as early specimens , intended for the old house , all spoiling and rotting ; Mr. Darrell wishes them to do so , I believe ! What he wishes must be done ! my dear young sir : a prodigious mind ; it is of granite ! "
47047	47054	47056	47056	Lionel	419	" I can not understand it , "
47060	47071	47056	47056	Lionel	419	" The last man I should have thought capriciously whimsical . "
47072	47123	47152	47153	a wizard	11357	" Whimsical ! Bless my soul ! do n't say such a word , do n't , pray ! or the roof will fall down upon us ! Come away . You have seen all you can see . You must go first now ; mind that loose stone there ! "
47182	47199	47179	47179	men	11144	" like leaves on trees , now green in youth , now withering on the ground . "
47362	47368	47370	47370	he	419	" It will rain soon , "
47372	47480	47370	47370	he	419	" Let us take advantage of the present time , and hear the flute , while we can yet enjoy the open air . No , not by the margin , or you will be always looking after the trout . On the rising ground , see that old thorn tree ; let us go and sit under it . The new building looks well from it . What a pile it would have been ! I may not ask you , I suppose , why it is left uncompleted . Perhaps it would have cost too much , or would have been disproportionate to the estate . "
47481	47556	47558	47558	Fairthorn	569	" To the present estate it would have been disproportioned , but not to the estate Mr. Darrell intended to add to it . As to cost , you do n't know him . He would never have undertaken what he could not afford to complete ; and what he once undertook , no thoughts of the cost would have scared him from finishing . Prodigious mind , - granite ! And so rich ! "
47567	47594	47558	47558	Fairthorn	569	" I ought to know ; I write all his letters on money matters . How much do you think he has , without counting land ? "
47595	47601	47558	47558	Fairthorn	569	" I can not guess . "
47602	47639	47558	47558	Fairthorn	569	" Nearly half a million ; in two years it will be more than half a million . And he had not three hundred a year when he began life ; for Fawley was sadly mortgaged . "
47640	47656	47558	47558	Fairthorn	569	" Is it possible ! Could any lawyer make half a million at the bar ? "
47657	47881	47558	47558	Fairthorn	569	" If any man could , Mr. Darrell would . When he sets his mind on a thing , the thing is done ; no help for it . But his fortune was not all made at the bar , though a great part of it was . An old East Indian bachelor of the same name , but who had never been heard of hereabouts till he wrote from Calcutta to Mr. Darrell inquiring if they were any relation , and Mr. Darrell referred him to the College - at - Arms , which proved that they came from the same stock ages ago , left him all his money . Mr. Darrell was not dependent on his profession when he stood up in Parliament . And since we have been here , such savings ! Not that Mr. Darrell is avaricious , but how can he spend money in this place ? You should have seen the establishment we kept in Carlton Gardens . Such a cook too , - a French gentleman , looked like a marquis . Those were happy days , and proud ones ! It is true that I order the dinner here , but it ca n't be the same thing . Do you like fillet of veal ? - we have one to - day . "
47882	47901	47558	47558	Fairthorn	569	" We used to have fillet of veal at school on Sundays . I thought it good then . "
47902	47909	47911	47912	Mr. Fairthorn	569	" It makes a nice mince , "
47922	47954	47919	47919	his	569	" One must think of dinner when one lives in the country : so little else to think of ! Not that Mr. Darrell does , but then he is granite ! "
47955	47958	47960	47960	Lionel	419	" Still , "
47964	47988	47960	47960	Lionel	419	" I do not get my answer . Why was the house uncompleted ? and why did Mr. Darrell retire from public life ? "
47989	48014	48016	48016	Fairthorn	569	" He took both into his head ; and when a thing once gets there , it is no use asking why . But , "
48032	48200	48019	48019	his	569	" but no doubt he had his reasons . He has reasons for all he does , only they lie far , far away from what appears on the surface , - far as that rivulet lies from its source ! My dear young sir , Mr. Darrell has known griefs on which it does not become you and me to talk . He never talks of them . The least I can do for my benefactor is not to pry into his secrets , nor babble them out . And he is so kind , so good , never gets into a passion ; but it is so awful to wound him , - it gives him such pain ; that 's why he frightens me , - frightens me horribly ; and so he will you when you come to know him . Prodigious mind ! - granite , - overgrown with sensitive plants . Yes , a little music will do us both good . "
48369	48372	48364	48365	The boy	1297	" Beautiful ! "
48378	48385	48387	48387	Fairthorn	569	" It is an old air , "
48389	48474	48387	48387	Fairthorn	569	" I do n't think it is known . I found its scale scrawled down in a copy of the ' Eikon Basilike , ' with the name of ' Joannes Darrell , Esq . , Aurat , ' written under it . That , by the date , was Sir John Darrell , the cavalier who fought for Charles I. , father of the graceless Sir Ralph , who flourished under Charles II . Both their portraits are in the dining - room . "
48475	48534	48570	48570	Fairthorn	569	" Tell me something of the family ; I know so little about it , - not even how the Haughtons and Darrells seem to have been so long connected . I see by the portraits that the Haughton name was borne by former Darrells , then apparently dropped , now it is borne again by my cousin . "
48535	48561	48387	48387	Fairthorn	569	" He bears it only as a Christian name . Your grandfather was his sponsor . But he is nevertheless the head of your family . "
48562	48569	48570	48570	Fairthorn	569	" So he says . How ? "
48609	49449	48387	48387	Fairthorn	569	" The Darrells are supposed to have got their name from a knight in the reign of Edward III . , who held the lists in a joust victoriously against all comers , and was called , or called himself , John the Dare - all ; or , in old spelling , the Der - all . They were amongst the most powerful families in the country ; their alliances were with the highest houses , - Montfichets , Nevilles , Mowbrays ; they descended through such marriages from the blood of Plantagenet kings . You 'll find their names in chronicles in the early French wars . Unluckily they attached themselves to the fortunes of Earl Warwick , the king - maker , to whose blood they were allied ; their representative was killed in the fatal field of Barnet ; their estates were of course confiscated ; the sole son and heir of that ill - fated politician passed into the Low Countries , where he served as a soldier . His son and grandson followed the same calling under foreign banners . But they must have kept up the love of the old land ; for in the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII . , the last male Darrell returned to England with some broad gold pieces saved by himself or his exiled fathers , bought some land in this county , in which the ancestral possessions had once been large , and built the present house , of a size suited to the altered fortunes of a race that in a former age had manned castles with retainers . The baptismal name of the soldier who thus partially refounded the old line in England was that now borne by your cousin , Guy , - a name always favoured by Fortune in the family annals ; for in Elizabeth 's time , from the rank of small gentry , to which their fortune alone lifted them since their return to their native land , the Darrells rose once more into wealth and eminence under a handsome young Sir Guy , - we have his picture in black flowered velvet , - who married the heiress of the Haughtons , a family that had grown rich under the Tudors , and was in high favour with the Maiden - Queen . This Sir Guy was befriended by Essex and knighted by Elizabeth herself . Their old house was then abandoned for the larger mansion of the Haughtons , which had also the advantage of being nearer to the Court , The renewed prosperity of the Darrells was of short duration . The Civil Wars came on , and Sir John Darrell took the losing side . He escaped to France with his only son . He is said to have been an accomplished , melancholy man ; and my belief is , that he composed that air which you justly admire for its mournful sweetness . He turned Roman Catholic and died in a convent . But the son , Ralph , was brought up in France with Charles II , and other gay roisterers . On the return of the Stuart , Ralph ran off with the daughter of the Roundhead to whom his estates had been given , and , after getting them back , left his wife in the country , and made love to other men 's wives in town . Shocking profligate ! no fruit could thrive upon such a branch . He squandered all he could squander , and would have left his children beggars , but that he was providentially slain in a tavern brawl for boasting of a lady 's favours to her husband 's face . The husband suddenly stabbed him , - no fair duello , for Sir Ralph was invincible with the small sword . Still the family fortune was much dilapidated , yet still the Darrells lived in the fine house of the Haughtons , and left Fawley to the owls . But Sir Ralph 's son , in his old age , married a second time , a young lady of high rank , an earl 's daughter . He must have been very much in love with her , despite his age , for to win her consent or her father 's he agreed to settle all the Haughton estates on her and the children she might bear to him . The smaller Darrell property had already been entailed on his son by his first marriage . This is how the family came to split . Old Darrell had children by his second wife ; the eldest of those children took the Haughton name and inherited the Haughton property . The son by the first marriage had nothing but Fawley and the scanty domain round it . You descend from the second marriage , Mr. Darrell from the first . You understand now , my dear young sir ? "
49450	49472	48570	48570	Fairthorn	569	" Yes , a little ; but I should very much like to know where those fine Haughton estates are now ? "
49473	49963	48387	48387	Fairthorn	569	" Where they are now ? I ca n't say . They were once in Middlesex . Probably much of the land , as it was sold piecemeal , fell into small allotments , constantly changing hands . But the last relics of the property were , I know , bought on speculation by Cox the distiller ; for , when we were in London , by Mr. Darrell 's desire I went to look after them , and inquire if they could be repurchased . And I found that so rapid in a few years has been the prosperity of this great commercial country , that if one did buy them back , one would buy twelve villas , several streets , two squares , and a paragon ! But as that symptom of national advancement , though a proud thought in itself , may not have any pleasing interest for you , I return to the Darrells . From the time in which the Haughton estate had parted from them , they settled back in their old house of Fawley . But they could never again hold up their heads with the noblemen and great squires in the county . As much as they could do to live at all upon the little patrimony ; still the reminiscence of what they had been made them maintain it jealously and entail it rigidly . The eldest son would never have thought of any profession or business ; the younger sons generally became soldiers , and being always a venturesome race , and having nothing particular to make them value their existence , were no less generally killed off betimes . The family became thoroughly obscure , slipped out of place in the county , seldom rose to be even justices of the peace , never contrived to marry heiresses again , but only the daughters of some neighbouring parson or squire as poor as themselves , but always of gentle blood . Oh , they were as proud as Spaniards in that respect ! So from father to son , each generation grew obscurer and poorer ; for , entail the estate as they might , still some settlements on it were necessary , and no settlements were ever brought into it ; and thus entails were cut off to admit some new mortgage , till the rent - roll was somewhat less than L300 a year when Mr. Darrell 's father came into possession . Yet somehow or other he got to college , where no Darrell had been since the time of the Glorious Revolution , and was a learned man and an antiquary , - A GREAT ANTIQUARY ! You may have read his works . I know there is one copy of them in the British Museum , and there is another here , but that copy Mr. Darrell keeps under lock and key . "
49964	49981	48570	48570	Fairthorn	569	" I am ashamed to say I do n't even know the titles of those works . "
49982	50219	48387	48387	Fairthorn	569	" There were ' Popular Ballads on the Wars of the Roses ; ' ' Darrelliana , ' consisting of traditional and other memorials of the Darrell family ; ' Inquiry into the Origin of Legends Connected with Dragons ; ' ' Hours amongst Monumental Brasses , ' and other ingenious lucubrations above the taste of the vulgar ; some of them were even read at the Royal Society of Antiquaries . They cost much to print and publish . But I have heard my father , who was his bailiff , say that he was a pleasant man , and was fond of reciting old scraps of poetry , which he did with great energy ; indeed , Mr. Darrell declares that it was the noticing , in his father 's animated and felicitous elocution , the effects that voice , look , and delivery can give to words , which made Mr. Darrell himself the fine speaker he is . But I can only recollect the antiquary as a very majestic gentleman , with a long pigtail - awful , rather , not so much so as his son , but still awful - and so sad - looking ; you would not have recovered your spirits for a week if you had seen him , especially when the old house wanted repairs , and he was thinking how he could pay for them ! "
50220	50233	48570	48570	Fairthorn	569	" Was Mr. Darrell , the present one , an only child ? "
50234	50478	48387	48387	Fairthorn	569	" Yes , and much with his father , whom he loved most dearly , and to this day he sighs if he has to mention his father 's name ! He has old Mr. Darrell 's portrait over the chimney - piece in his own reading - room ; and he had it in his own library in Carlton Gardens . Our Mr. Darrell 's mother was very pretty , even as I remember her : she died when he was about ten years old . And she too was a relation of yours , - a Haughton by blood , - but perhaps you will be ashamed of her , when I say she was a governess in a rich mercantile family . She had been left an orphan . I believe old Mr. Darrell not that he was old then married her because the Haughtons could or would do nothing for her , and because she was much snubbed and put upon , as I am told governesses usually are , - married her because , poor as he was , he was still the head of both families , and bound to do what he could for decayed scions . The first governess a Darrell , ever married ; but no true Darrell would have called that a mesalliance since she was still a Haughton and ' Fors non mutat genus , ' - Chance does not change race . "
50479	50503	48570	48570	Fairthorn	569	" But how comes it that the Haughtons , my grandfather Haughton , I suppose , would do nothing for his own kinswoman ? "
50504	50642	48387	48387	Fairthorn	569	" It was not your grandfather Robert Haughton , who was a generous man , - he was then a mere youngster , hiding himself for debt , - but your great - grandfather , who was a hard man and on the turf . He never had money to give , - only money for betting . He left the Haughton estates sadly clipped . But when Robert succeeded , he came forward , was godfather to our Mr. Darrell , insisted on sharing the expense of sending him to Eton , where he became greatly distinguished ; thence to Oxford , where he increased his reputation ; and would probably have done more for him , only Mr. Darrell , once his foot on the ladder , wanted no help to climb to the top . "
50643	50673	48570	48570	Fairthorn	569	" Then my grandfather , Robert , still had the Haughton estates ? Their last relics had not been yet transmuted by Mr. Cox into squares and a paragon ? "
50674	50830	48387	48387	Fairthorn	569	" No ; the grand old mansion , though much dilapidated , with its park , though stripped of salable timber , was still left with a rental from farms that still appertained to the residence , which would have sufficed a prudent man for the luxuries of life , and allowed a reserve fund to clear off the mortgages gradually . Abstinence and self - denial for one or two generations would have made a property , daily rising in value as the metropolis advanced to its outskirts , a princely estate for a third . But Robert Haughton , though not on the turf , had a grand way of living ; and while Guy Darrell went into the law to make a small patrimony a large fortune , your father , my dear young sir , was put into the Guards to reduce a large patrimony - into Mr. Cox 's distillery . "
50874	50952	50838	50838	Fairthorn	569	" Your father and Guy Darrell were warm friends as boys and youths . Guy was the elder of the two , and Charlie Haughton I beg your pardon , he was always called Charlie looked up to him as to an elder brother . Many 's the scrape Guy got him out of ; and many a pound , I believe , when Guy had some funds of his own , did Guy lend to Charlie . "
50953	50962	50964	50964	Lionel	419	" I am very sorry to hear that , "
50972	50989	50968	50968	Fairthorn	569	" I ' m afraid I have made a blunder . Do n't tell Mr. Darrell . "
50990	51016	51017	51017	Your	2445	" Certainly not ; I promise . But how came my father to need this aid , and how came they at last to quarrel ? "
51429	51429	51601	51601	Fairthorn	569	"
51430	51434	51436	51436	Lionel	419	" My mother ! "
51440	51452	51436	51436	Lionel	419	" and the best of women she is . What then ? "
51453	51484	51601	51601	Fairthorn	569	" Nothing , my dear young sir , - nothing , except that Mr. Darrell never forgave it . He has his prejudices : this marriage shocked one of them . "
51485	51512	51436	51436	Lionel	419	" Prejudice against my poor mother ! I always supposed so ! I wonder why ? The most simple - hearted , inoffensive , affectionate woman . "
51513	51545	51601	51601	Fairthorn	569	" I have not a doubt of it ; but it is beginning to rain . Let us go home . I should like some luncheon : it breaks the day . "
51546	51593	51436	51436	Lionel	419	" Tell me first why Mr. Darrell has a prejudice against my mother . I do n't think that he has even seen her . Unaccountable caprice ! Shocked him , too , - what a word ! Tell me - I beg - I insist . "
51594	51599	51601	51601	Fairthorn	569	" But you know , "
51609	51691	51601	51601	Fairthorn	569	" that Mrs. Haughton was the daughter of a linendraper , and her father 's money got Charlie out of the county jail ; and Mr. Darrell said , ' Sold even your name ! ' My father heard him say it in the hall at Fawley . Mr. Darrell was there during a long vacation , and your father came to see him . Your father fired up , and they never saw each other , I believe , again . "
51767	51773	51774	51774	His	11694	" Sold even your name . "
52329	52782	52312	52312	Darrell	512	" nay , most probably ascribed to her not the fond girlish love which levels all disparities of rank , but the vulgar cold - blooded design to exchange her father 's bank - notes for a marriage beyond her station . And he was the debtor to this supercilious creditor , as his father had been before him . His father ! till then he had been so proud of that relationship ! Mrs. Haughton had not been happy with her captain ; his confirmed habits of wild dissipation had embittered her union , and at last worn away her wifely affections . But she had tended and nursed him in his last illness as the lover of her youth ; and though occasionally she hinted at his faults , she ever spoke of him as the ornament of all society , - poor , it is true , harassed by unfeeling creditors , but the finest of fine gentlemen . Lionel had never heard from her of the ancestral estates sold for a gambling debt ; never from her of the county jail nor the mercenary misalliance . In boyhood , before we have any cause to be proud of ourselves , we are so proud of our fathers , if we have a decent excuse for it . Of his father could Lionel Haughton be proud now ? And Darrell was cognizant of his paternal disgrace , had taunted his father in yonder old hall - for what ? - the marriage from which Lionel sprang ! The hands grew tighter and tighter before that burning face . He did not weep , as he had done in Vance 's presence at a thought much less galling . Not that tears would have misbecome him . Shallow judges of human nature are they who think that tears in themselves ever misbecome boy or even man . Well did the sternest of Roman writers place the arch distinction of humanity aloft from all meaner of Heaven 's creatures , in the prerogative of tears ! Sooner mayst thou trust thy purse to a professional pickpocket than give loyal friendship to the man who boasts of eyes to which the heart never mounts in dew ! Only , when man weeps he should be alone , - not because tears are weak , but because they should be sacred . Tears are akin to prayers . Pharisees parade prayer ! impostors parade tears . O Pegasus , Pegasus , - softly , softly , - thou hast hurried me off amidst the clouds : drop me gently down - there , by the side of the motionless boy in the shadowy glen .
52802	52810	52786	52787	Lionel Haughton	419	" What will he do with it ? "
52811	52819	52896	52896	Darrell	512	" I have been seeking you everywhere , "
52865	52879	52850	52851	Guy Darrell	1039	" Will you come in for a few minutes ? you are wanted . "
52880	52895	52896	52896	Darrell	512	" What for ? I would rather stay here . Who can want me ? "
52932	53032	52896	52896	Darrell	512	" Some one very commonplace , but since the Picts went out of fashion , very necessary to mortals the most sublime . I ought to apologize for his coming . You threatened to leave me yesterday because of a defect in your wardrobe . Mr. Fairthorn wrote to my tailor to hasten hither and repair it . He is here . I commend him to your custom ! Do n't despise him because he makes for a man of my remote generation . Tailors are keen observers and do not grow out of date so quickly as politicians . "
53076	53157	53158	53158	He	419	" No , sir ; I will not stoop to this ! I will not be clothed by your charity , - yours ! I will not submit to an implied taunt upon my poor mother 's ignorance of the manners of a rank to which she was not born ! You said we might not like each other , and , if so , we should part forever . I do not like you , and I will go ! "
53212	53216	53218	53219	Guy Darrell	1039	" I declare , "
53229	53300	53218	53219	Guy Darrell	1039	" I declare that I almost feel as if I could once again be capable of an emotion ! I hope I am not going to like that boy ! The old Darrell blood in his veins , surely . I might have spoken as he did at his age , but I must have had some better reason for it . What did I say to justify such an explosion ?
53301	53429	53218	53219	Guy Darrell	1039	" Quid feci ? - ubi lapsus ? Gone , no doubt , to pack up his knapsack , and take the Road to Ruin ! Shall I let him go ? Better for me , if I am really in danger of liking him ; and so be at his mercy to sting - what ? my heart ! I defy him ; it is dead . No ; he shall not go thus . I am the head of our joint houses . Houses ! I wish he had a house , poor boy ! And his grandfather loved me . Let him go ? I will beg his pardon first ; and he may dine in his drawers if that will settle the matter . "
53447	53450	53452	53452	Darrell	512	" Ha ! "
53484	53520	53464	53465	Mr. Fairthorn	569	" I have hit it ! That abominable Fairthorn has been shedding its prickles ! How could I trust flesh and blood to such a bramble ? I 'll know what it was this instant ! "
53575	53579	53549	53549	he	569	" nullis penetrabilis astris "
53620	53628	53667	53667	his	512	" What will he do with it ? "
53702	53718	53667	53667	his	512	" I must have hurt your feelings , and I come to beg your pardon ! "
53984	54052	54054	54054	Darrell	512	" Lionel Haughton , you have the heart of a gentleman that can never listen to a frank apology for unintentional wrong but what it springs forth to take the blame to itself and return apology tenfold . Enough ! A mistake no doubt , on both sides . More time must elapse before either can truly say that he does not like the other . Meanwhile , "
54087	54096	54097	54097	I	0	" meanwhile must I send away the tailor ? "
54513	54539	54488	54488	he	512	" Never think it enough to have solved the problem started by another mind till you have deduced from it a corollary of your own . "
55501	55508	55493	55493	ourselves	2557	" Let us bear what is ; "
55733	55747	55689	55689	he	1297	" Here are sands for a pilgrim , not fields for a conqueror . "
55867	55883	55864	55865	a groom	2344	" Do you ever ride that chestnut ? I think it even handsomer than this . "
55884	55909	55830	55831	the horseman	2573	" Half our preferences are due to the vanity they flatter . Few can ride this horse ; any one , perhaps , that . "
55910	55918	55920	55920	Lionel	419	" There speaks the Dare - all ! "
55931	55940	55942	55942	he	419	" Where no difficulty , there no pleasure , "
55949	56014	55942	55942	he	419	" I was in Spain two years ago . I had not an English horse there , so I bought that Andalusian jennet . What has served him at need , no preux chevalier would leave to the chance of ill - usage . So the jennet came with me to England . You have not been much accustomed to ride , I suppose ? "
56015	56049	55944	55944	his	419	" Not much ; but my dear mother thought I ought to learn . She pinched for a whole year to have me taught at a riding - school during one school vacation . "
56050	56070	55942	55942	he	419	" Your mother 's relations are , I believe , well off . Do they suffer her to pinch ? "
56071	56088	55944	55944	his	419	" I do not know that she has relations living ; she never speaks of them . "
56089	56092	55942	55942	he	419	" Indeed ! "
56124	56158	56110	56110	He	512	" I was not aware that you are a horseman , or I would have asked you to accompany me ; will you do so to - morrow , and mount the jennet ? "
56159	56172	55944	55944	his	419	" Oh , thank you ; I should like it so much . "
56184	56190	56191	56191	he	512	" I am only sorry , "
56197	56250	56191	56191	he	512	" that our excursions can be but few . On Friday next I shall submit to you a proposition ; if you accept it , we shall part on Saturday , - liking each other , I hope : speaking for myself , the experiment has not failed ; and on yours ? "
56251	56278	56110	56110	He	512	" On mine ! - oh , Mr. Darrell , if I dared but tell you what recollections of yourself the experiment will bequeath to me ! "
56279	56291	56293	56293	Darrell	512	" Do not tell me , if they imply a compliment , "
56342	56356	56358	56358	Darrell	512	" Could the pipe of Horace 's Faunus be sweeter than that flute ? "
56360	56373	56358	56358	Darrell	512	" ' Utcunque dulci , Tyndare , fistula , Valles , ' etc .
56513	56513	56503	56505	the ambitious Orion	2583	"
56733	56749	56750	56750	Darrell	512	" In recognizing you as kinsman , I shall henceforth provide for you as gentleman . "
56783	56818	56834	56834	You	2592	" I have now behaved as becomes me : the rest belongs to you . We may never meet again . There is no reason why this good - by may not be forever . "
57410	57427	57396	57397	Henry VIII	596	" I can make a lord any day , but I can not make a Holbein ! "
57559	57562	57563	57563	he	512	" Certainly , "
57573	57694	57563	57563	he	512	" Fame confers a rank above that of gentlemen and of kings ; and as soon as she issues her patent of nobility , it matters not a straw whether the recipient be the son of a Bourbon or of a tallow - chandler . But if Fame withhold her patent ; if a well - born man paint aldermen , and be not famous and I dare say you would have been neither a Titian nor a Holbein , - why , he might as well be a painter and plumber , and has a better chance even of bread and cheese by standing to his post as gentleman . Mrs. Haughton was right , and I respect her . "
57695	57718	57555	57555	his	512	" Quite right . If I lived to the age of Methuselah , I could not paint a head like Frank Vance . "
57719	57733	57563	57563	he	512	" And even he is not famous yet . Never heard of him . "
57734	57784	57555	57555	his	512	" He will be famous : I am sure of it ; and if you lived in London , you would hear of him even now . Oh , sir ! such a portrait as he painted the other day ! But I must tell you all about it . "
58000	58007	58009	58009	Lionel	419	" And , oh , sir ! "
58025	58028	58033	58033	he	419	" oh , "
58055	58289	58033	58033	he	419	" oh , sir ! you are so wise and rich and kind , do rescue that poor child from the penury and hardships of such a life ! If you could but have seen and heard her ! She could never have been born to it ! You look away : I offend you ! I have no right to tax your benevolence for others ; but , instead of showering favours upon me , so little would suffice for her ! - if she were but above positive want , with that old man she would not be happy without him , safe in such a cottage as you give to your own peasants ! I am a man , or shall be one soon ; I can wrestle with the world , and force my way somehow ; but that delicate child , a village show , or a beggar on the high road ! - no mother , no brother , no one but that broken - down cripple , leaning upon her arm as his crutch . I can not bear to think of it . I am sure I shall meet her again somewhere ; and when I do , may I not write to you , and will you not come to her help ? Do speak ; do say ' Yes , ' Mr. Darrell . "
58326	58375	58403	58404	Guy Darrell	1039	" Let go my reins ; see , my horse puts down his ears ; he may do you a mischief . Now canter on : you shall be satisfied . Give me a moment to - to unbutton my coat : it is too tight for me . "
58397	58401	58403	58404	Guy Darrell	1039	" Lionel Haughton , "
58422	58655	58403	58404	Guy Darrell	1039	" I have to thank you for one very happy minute ; the sight of a heart so fresh in the limpid purity of goodness is a luxury you can not comprehend till you have come to my age ; journeyed , like me , from Dan to Beersheba , and found all barren . Heed me : if you had been half - a - dozen years older , and this child for whom you plead had been a fair young woman , perhaps just as innocent , just as charming , - more in peril , - my benevolence would have lain as dormant as a stone . A young man 's foolish sentiment for a pretty girl , - as your true friend , I should have shrugged my shoulders and said , ' Beware ! ' Had I been your father , I should have taken alarm and frowned . I should have seen the sickly romance which ends in dupes and deceivers . But at your age , you , hearty , genial , and open - hearted boy , - you , caught but by the chivalrous compassion for helpless female childhood , - oh , that you were my son , - oh , that my dear father 's blood were in those knightly veins ! I had a son once ! God took him ; "
58667	59033	58663	58663	he	2645	" I felt there was manhood in you , when you wrote to fling my churlish favours in my teeth ; when you would have left my roof - tree in a burst of passion which might be foolish , but was nobler than the wisdom of calculating submission , manhood , but only perhaps man 's pride as man , - man 's heart not less cold than winter . To - day you have shown me something far better than pride ; that nature which constitutes the heroic temperament is completed by two attributes , - unflinching purpose , disinterested humanity . I know not yet if you have the first ; you reveal to me the second . Yes ! I accept the duties you propose to me ; I will do more than leave to you the chance of discovering this poor child . I will direct my solicitor to take the right steps to do so . I will see that she is safe from the ills you feel for her . Lionel , more still , I am impatient till I write to Mrs. Haughton . I did her wrong . Remember , I have never seen her . I resented in her the cause of my quarrel with your father , who was once dear to me . Enough of that . I disliked the tone of her letters to me . I disliked it in the mother of a boy who had Darrell blood ; other reasons too , - let them pass . But in providing for your education ; I certainly thought her relations provided for her support . She never asked me for help there ; and , judging of her hastily , I thought she would not have scrupled to do so , if my help there had not been forestalled . You have made me understand her better ; and , at all events , three - fourths of what we are in boyhood most of us owe to our mothers ! You are frank , fearless , affectionate , a gentleman . I respect the mother who has such a son . "
59596	59600	59547	59547	his	512	" Faerie Queene , "
59603	59619	59547	59547	his	512	" Why do you take him to your heart if he does not comfort it ? "
59626	59643	59620	59620	Darrell	512	" I did not know you were in the room . Poor Fairthorn ; thank you ! "
59644	59652	59686	59686	you	512	" Thank me ! - what for ? "
59653	59668	59620	59620	Darrell	512	" For a kind thought . So , then , you like the boy ? "
59669	59676	59678	59678	Fairthorn	569	" May n't I like him ? "
59689	59689	59686	59686	you	512	"
59690	59710	59712	59712	Darrell	512	" Yes , I like him much ; I am trying my best to love him . But , but "
59819	59829	59830	59830	he	512	" Yes , my father , it is so ! "
59834	59896	59830	59830	he	512	" All my sacrifices were in vain . The race is not to be rebuilt ! No grandchild of yours will succeed me , - me , the last of the old line ! Fairthorn , how can I love that boy ? He may be my heir , and in his veins not a drop of my father 's blood ! "
59897	59942	59814	59814	Darrell	512	" But he has the blood of your father 's ancestors ; and why must you think of him as your heir ? - you , who , if you would but go again into the world , might yet find a fair wi - "
60008	60047	60056	60056	Darrell	512	" Do n't , do n't now , do n't be so awful ; I did not mean to offend , but I 'm always saying something I did not mean ; and really you look so young still "
60050	60055	60056	60056	Darrell	512	" and , and - "
60120	60147	60103	60103	he	2328	" Master , master , forgive me ! Beast that I was ! Do look up - do smile or else beat me - kick me . "
60165	60170	60172	60175	the man of granite	2673	" Hush , hush , "
60177	60187	60172	60175	the man of granite	2673	" one moment , and it will be over . "
60556	60560	60550	60550	Lionel	419	" Faerie Queene , "
60641	60700	60636	60636	Lionel	419	" But this is the very scene ! Here the young knight , leaving his father 's hall , would have checked his destrier , glancing wistfully now over that green wild which seems so boundless , now to the ' umbrageous horror ' of those breathless woodlands , and questioned himself which way to take for adventure . "
60701	60704	60706	60706	Darrell	512	" Yes , "
60723	60744	60745	60745	He	512	" Yes , and the gold of the gorse - blossoms tempted me ; and I took the waste land . "
60753	60803	60804	60804	he	512	" And then , when I had known cities and men , and snatched romance from dull matter - of - fact , then I would have done as civilization does with romance itself , - I would have enclosed the waste land for my own aggrandizement . Look , "
60819	60895	60804	60804	he	512	" all that you see to the verge of the horizon , some fourteen years ago , was to have been thrown into the pretty paddock we have just quitted , and serve as park round the house I was then building . Vanity of human wishes ! What but the several proportions of their common folly distinguishes the baffled squire from the arrested conqueror ? Man 's characteristic cerebral organ must certainly be acquisitiveness . "
60896	60919	60745	60745	He	512	" Was it his organ of acquisitiveness that moved Themistocles to boast that ' he could make a small state great ' ? "
60920	60928	60930	60930	Darrell	512	" Well remembered , - ingeniously quoted , "
60941	61057	60937	60937	his	512	" Yes , I suspect that the coveting organ had much to do with the boast . To build a name was the earliest dream of Themistocles , if we are to accept the anecdote that makes him say , ' The trophies of Miltiades would not suffer him to sleep , ' To build a name , or to create a fortune , are but varying applications of one human passion . The desire of something we have not is the first of our childish remembrances : it matters not what form it takes , what object it longs for ; still it is to acquire ! it never deserts us while we live . "
61058	61082	61106	61106	his	512	" And yet , if I might , I should like to ask , what you now desire that you do not possess ? "
61083	61101	61103	61103	Darrell	512	" I - nothing ; but I spoke of the living ! I am dead . Only , "
61110	61131	61106	61106	his	512	" I say , as poor Chesterfield said before me , ' It is a secret : keep it . ' "
61224	61227	61229	61229	he	512	" Perhaps , "
61244	61332	61229	61229	he	512	" perhaps the love of power is at the origin of each restless courtship of Fortune : yet , after all , who has power with less alloy than the village thane ? With so little effort , so little thought , the man in the manor - house can make men in the cottage happier here below and more fit for a hereafter yonder . In leaving the world I come from contest and pilgrimage , like our sires the Crusaders , to reign at home . "
61422	61426	61428	61430	the old man	1741	" Master Guy ! "
61449	61464	61465	61465	Darrell	512	" Sit down , Matthew , and let , me read you a chapter . "
61595	61604	61584	61584	Lionel	419	" And is there not power in this ? "
61737	61747	61748	61748	he	512	" And I could have been so happy here ! "
61752	61971	61748	61748	he	512	" Can I not be so yet ? Ay , perhaps , when I am thoroughly old , - tied to the world but by the thread of an hour . Old men do seem happy ; behind them , all memories faint , save those of childhood and sprightly youth ; before them , the narrow ford , and the sun dawning up through the clouds on the other shore . ' T is the critical descent into age in which man is surely most troubled ; griefs gone , still rankling ; nor - strength yet in his limbs , passion yet in his heart - reconciled to what loom nearest in the prospect , - the armchair and the palsied head . Well ! life is a quaint puzzle . Bits the most incongruous join into each other , and the scheme thus gradually becomes symmetrical and clear ; when , lo ! as the infant claps his hands and cries , ' See ! see ! the puzzle is made out ! ' all the pieces are swept back into the box , - black box with the gilded nails . Ho ! Lionel , look up ; there is our village church , and here , close at my right , the churchyard ! "
62169	62192	62166	62167	the man	1450	" The taller gentleman yonder is surely your squire , is he not ? but who is the shorter and younger person ? "
62200	62246	62193	62194	The landlady	2738	" Oh ! that is a relation of the squire down on a visit , sir . I heard coachman say that the squire 's taken to him hugely ; and they do think at the Hall that the young gentleman will be his heir . "
62247	62272	62355	62356	the landlady	2738	" Aha ! - indeed - his heir ! What is the lad 's name ? What relation can he be to Mr. Darrell ? "
62273	62306	62193	62194	The landlady	2738	" I do n't know what relation exactly , sir ; but he is one of the Haughtons , and they 've been kin to the Fawley folks time out of mind . "
62307	62324	62355	62356	the landlady	2738	" Haughton ? - aha ! Thank you , ma'am . Change , if you please . "
62340	62353	62355	62356	the landlady	2738	" Beg pardon , sir , but this must be forring money , "
62371	62378	62379	62380	The stranger	2739	" Foreign ! Is it possible ? "
62400	62426	62355	62356	the landlady	2738	" Sixpence more , if you please , sir ; three brandies , and bread - and - cheese and the ale too , sir . "
62427	62476	62355	62356	the landlady	2738	" How stupid I am ! I thought that French coin was a five shilling piece . I fear I have no English money about me but this half - crown ; and I ca n't ask you to trust me , as you do n't know me . "
62477	62501	62355	62356	the landlady	2738	" Oh , sir , ' t is all one if you know the squire . You may be passing this way again . "
62502	62518	62520	62521	the stranger	2739	" I shall not forget my debt when I do , you may be sure , "
63103	63108	63110	63111	the stranger	2739	" So , so , "
63113	63198	63199	63199	He	2661	" That boy his heir ? so , so . How can I get to speak to him ? In his own house he would not see me : it must be as now , in the open air ; but how catch him alone ? and to lurk in the inn , in his own village , - perhaps for a day , - to watch an occasion ; impossible ! Besides , where is the money for it ? Courage , courage ! "
63209	63220	63199	63199	He	2661	" Courage ! Why not now ? Now or never ! "
63266	63276	63263	63263	Darrell	512	" Here is the doe waiting to welcome you . "
63333	63348	63349	63349	Darrell	512	" Pardon , me ; something to communicate , - important ; hear me . "
63397	63421	63393	63393	his	512	" You here ! You in England - at Fawley ! You presume to accost me ! You , sir , - you ! "
63564	63579	63587	63587	he	512	" Go home , Lionel ; this person would speak to me in private . "
63593	63620	63587	63587	he	512	" Close the gate , sir ; you are standing upon the land of my fathers . If you would speak with me , this way ; "
63682	63685	63687	63687	Lionel	419	" Come , "
63689	63692	63687	63687	Lionel	419	" come . "
63715	63718	63720	63720	he	1297	" Doubtless , "
63732	63732	63720	63720	he	1297	"
63924	63927	63901	63901	He	569	" granite . "
63928	63936	63938	63938	Fairthorn	569	" Lord , my dear young sir , "
63940	64010	63938	63938	Fairthorn	569	" be his most bitter open enemy , and fall down in the mire , the first hand to help you would be Guy Darrell 's ; but be his professed friend , and betray him to the worth of a straw , and never try to see his face again if you are wise , - the most forgiving and the least forgiving of human beings . But - "
64024	64033	64018	64018	Darrell	512	" Fairthorn , let me speak with you . "
64268	64271	64272	64272	he	512	" Yes , "
64284	64391	64272	64272	he	512	" I am ill . Idle persons like me give way to illness . When I was a busy man , I never did ; and then illness gave way to me . My general plans are thus , if not actually altered , at least hurried to their consummation sooner than I expected . Before you came here , I told you to come soon , or you might not find me . I meant to go abroad this summer ; I shall now start at once . I need the change of scene and air . You will return to London to - day . "
64392	64404	64256	64256	he	512	" To - day ! You are not angry with me ? "
64405	64414	64416	64416	Darrell	512	" Angry ! boy and cousin - no ! "
64425	64657	64416	64416	Darrell	512	" Angry - fie ! But since the parting must be , ' t is well to abridge the pain of long farewell . You must wish , too , to see your mother , and thank her for rearing you up so that you may step from poverty into ease with a head erect . You will give to Mrs. Haughton this letter : for yourself , your inclinations seem to tend towards the army . But before you decide on that career , I should like you to see something more of the world . Call to - morrow on Colonel Morley , in Curzon Street : this is his address . He will receive by to - day 's post a note from me , requesting him to advise you . Follow his counsels in what belongs to the world . He is a man of the world , - a distant connection of mine , who will be kind to you for my sake . Is there more to say ? Yes . It seems an ungracious speech ; but I should speak it . Consider yourself sure from me of an independent income . Never let idle sycophants lead you into extravagance by telling you that you will have more . But indulge not the expectation , however plausible , that you will be my heir . "
64658	64666	64748	64748	he	512	" Mr. Darrell - oh , sir - "
64667	64704	64705	64705	Darrell	512	" Hush ! the expectation would be reasonable ; but I am a strange being . I might marry again , - have heirs of my own . Eh , sir , - Oh why not ? "
64724	64728	64715	64715	his	512	" Why not ? "
64753	64846	64748	64748	he	512	" Enough ; what I have thus rudely said was kindly meant . It is a treason to a young man to let him count on a fortune which at last is left away from him . Now , Lionel , go ; enjoy your spring of life ! Go , hopeful and light - hearted . If sorrow reach you , battle with it ; if error mislead you , come fearlessly to me for counsel . Why , boy , what is this ? - tears ? Tut , tut . "
64847	64853	64855	64855	Lionel	419	" It is your goodness , "
64857	64876	64855	64855	Lionel	419	" I can not help it . And is there nothing I can do for you in return ? "
64877	64944	64748	64748	he	512	" Yes , much . Keep your name free from stain , and your heart open to such noble emotions as awaken tears like those . Ah , by the by , I heard from my lawyer to - day about your poor little protegee . Not found yet , but he seems sanguine of quick success . You shall know the moment I hear more . "
64945	64963	64855	64855	Lionel	419	" You will write to me , then , sir , and I may write to you ? "
64964	64977	64748	64748	he	512	" As often as you please . Always direct to me here . "
64978	64985	64855	64855	Lionel	419	" Shall you be long abroad ? "
64991	64997	64999	64999	he	512	" I do n't know , "
65003	65006	64999	64999	he	512	" Adieu . "
65031	65038	65039	65039	he	419	" God bless you , sir , "
65047	65056	65058	65058	Darrell	512	" That blessing should have come from me ! "
65074	65148	65060	65060	himself	512	" But they on whose heads I once poured a blessing , where are they , - where ? And that man 's tale , reviving the audacious fable which the other , and I verily believe the less guilty knave of the two , sought to palm on me years ago ! Stop ; let me weigh well what he said . If it were true ! Oh , shame , shame ! "
65212	65240	65199	65199	his	512	" A lie , - certainly a palpable and gross lie ; lie it must and shall be . Never will I accept it as truth . Father "
65252	65262	65199	65199	his	512	" Father , fear not - never - never ! "
65379	65383	65424	65424	She	442	" How dye do "
65385	65389	65424	65424	She	442	" Pretty Poll . "
65539	65547	65549	65549	he	2814	" You are sad , little one ? "
65551	65557	65532	65532	she	442	" Very sad , Grandy . "
65558	65600	65532	65532	she	442	" And displeased with me ? Yes , displeased that I have taken you suddenly away from the pretty young gentleman , who was so kind to you , without encouraging the chance that you were to meet with him again . "
65601	65610	65612	65612	Sophy	442	" It was not like you , Grandy , "
65631	65634	65636	65637	the vagabond	2818	" True , "
65639	65686	65636	65637	the vagabond	2818	" anything resembling common - sense is not like me . But do n't you think that I did what I felt was best for you ? Must I not have some good cause for it , whenever I have the heart deliberately to vex you ? "
65943	66004	65933	65933	his	433	" But if I see you thus cast down , I shall have no strength left to hobble on through the world ; and the sooner I lie down , and the dust is shovelled over me , why , the better for you ; for it seems that Heaven sends you friends , and I tear you from them . "
66044	66072	66015	66015	she	442	" Do n't talk so ! I 've been ungrateful and wicked . I do n't care for any one but my own dear , dear Grandy . "
66188	66291	66171	66171	he	1741	" Ah , at your age , my darling , I had not your troubles and hardships . I had not to trudge these dusty roads on foot with a broken - down good - for - nothing scatterling ; I trod rich carpets , and slept under silken curtains . I took the air in gay carriages , - I such a scapegrace ; and you , little child , you so good ! All gone , all melted away from me , and not able now to be sure that you will have a crust of bread this day week . "
66292	66308	66310	66310	Sophy	442	" Oh , yes ! I shall have bread , and you too , Grandy , "
66316	66418	66420	66420	Sophy	442	" It was you who taught me to pray to God , and said that in all your troubles God had been good to you : and He has been so good to me since I prayed to Him ; for I have no dreadful Mrs. Crane to beat me now , and say things more hard to bear than beating ; and you have taken me to yourself . How I prayed for that ! And I take care of you too , Grandy , - do n't I ? I prayed for that too ; and as to carriages , "
66426	66483	66420	66420	Sophy	442	" I do n't care if I am never in a carriage as long as I live ; and you know I have been in a van , which is bigger than a carriage , and I did n't like that at all . But how came people to behave so ill to you , Grandy ? "
66484	66496	66171	66171	he	1741	" I never said people behaved ill to me , Sophy . "
66497	66521	66420	66420	Sophy	442	" Did not they take away the carpets and silk curtains , and all the fine things you had as a little boy ? "
66522	66528	66530	66530	Waife	442	" I do n't know , "
66537	66549	66530	66530	Waife	442	" that people actually took them away ; but they melted away .
66550	66668	66420	66420	Sophy	442	" However , I had much still to be thankful for : I was so strong , and had such high spirits , Sophy , and found people not behaving ill to me , - quite the contrary , so kind . I found no Crane she monster as you did , my little angel . Such prospects before me , if I had walked straight towards them ! But I followed my own fancy , which led me zigzag ; and now that I would stray back into the high road , you see before you a man whom a Justice of the Peace could send to the treadmill for presuming to live without a livelihood . "
66672	66700	66669	66669	SOPHY	442	" Not without a livelihood ! - the what did you call it ? - independent income , - that is , the Three Pounds , Grandy ? "
66705	66751	66701	66701	WAIFE	442	" Sensible child . That is true . Yes , Heaven is very good to me still . Ah ! what signifies fortune ? How happy I was with my dear Lizzy , and yet no two persons could live more from hand to mouth . "
66757	66760	66752	66752	SOPHY	442	" tizzy ? "
66771	66815	66761	66761	WAIFE	442	" My wife . She was only spared to me two years : such sunny years ! And how grateful I ought to be that she did not live longer . She was saved - such - such - such shame and misery ! "
66841	67099	66820	66820	Waife	442	" What 's the good of looking back ? A man 's gone self is a dead thing . It is not I - now tramping this road , with you to lean upon - whom I see , when I would turn to look behind on that which I once was : it is another being , defunct and buried ; and when I say to myself , ' that being did so and so , ' it is like reading an epitaph on a tombstone . So , at last , solitary and hopeless , I came back to my own land ; and I found you , - a blessing greater than I had ever dared to count on . And how was I to maintain you , and take you from that long - nosed alligator called Crane , and put you in womanly gentle hands ; for I never thought then of subjecting you to all you have since undergone with me , - I who did not know one useful thing in life by which a man can turn a penny . And then , as I was all alone in a village ale - house , on my way back from - it does not signify from what , or from whence , but I was disappointed and despairing , Providence mercifully threw in my way - Mr. Rugge , and ordained me to be of great service to that ruffian , and that ruffian of great use to me . "
67103	67110	67100	67100	SOPHY	442	" Ah , how was that ? "
67114	67254	67111	67111	WAIFE	442	" It was fair time in the village wherein I stopped , and Rugge 's principal actor was taken off by delirium tremens , which is Latin for a disease common to men who eat little and drink much . Rugge came into the alehouse bemoaning his loss . A bright thought struck me . Once in my day I had been used to acting . I offered to try my chance on Mr. Rugge 's stage : he caught at me , I at him . I succeeded : we came to terms , and my little Sophy was thus taken from that ringleted crocodile , and placed with Christian females who wore caps and read their Bible . Is not Heaven good to us , Sophy ; and to me too - me , such a scamp ? "
67255	67270	67100	67100	SOPHY	442	" And you did all that , - suffered all that for my sake ? "
67271	67406	67408	67408	Waife	442	" Suffered , but I liked it . And , besides , I must have done something ; and there were reasons - in short , I was quite happy ; no , not actually happy , but comfortable and merry . Providence gives thick hides to animals that must exist in cold climates ; and to the man whom it reserves for sorrow , Providence gives a coarse , jovial temper . Then , when by a mercy I was saved from what I most disliked and dreaded , and never would have thought of but that I fancied it might be a help to you , - I mean the London stage , - and had that bad accident on the railway , how did it end ? Oh ! in saving you "
67415	67526	67408	67408	Waife	442	" in saving your destiny from what might be much worse for you , body and soul , than the worst that has happened to you with me . And so we have been thrown together ; and so you have supported me ; and so , when we could exist without Mr. Rugge , Providence got rid of him for us . And so we are now walking along the high road ; and through yonder trees you can catch a peep of the roof under which we are about to rest for a while ; and there you will learn what I have done with the Three Pounds ! "
67527	67537	67100	67100	SOPHY	442	" It is not the Spotted Boy , Grandy ? "
67538	67541	67543	67543	Waife	442	" No , "
67547	67577	67543	67543	Waife	442	" the Spotted Boy is a handsome income ; but let us only trust in Providence , and I should not wonder if our new acquisition proved a monstrous - "
67578	67581	67100	67100	SOPHY	442	" Monstrous ! "
67582	67588	67543	67543	Waife	442	" Piece of good fortune . "
67634	67655	67620	67623	an old peasant woman	2840	" Indeed , sir , I am glad you are come . I ' se most afeared he be dead . "
67656	67659	67661	67661	Waife	433	" Dead ! "
67663	67674	67661	67661	Waife	433	" Oh , Sophy , if he should be dead ! "
67675	67678	67620	67623	an old peasant woman	2840	" Who ? "
67686	67694	67696	67696	he	433	" What makes you think him dead ? "
67712	67728	67696	67696	he	433	" You have not been disobeying my strict orders , and tampering with the door ? "
67729	67774	67620	67623	an old peasant woman	2840	" Lor ' love ye , no , sir . But he made such a noise at fust - awful ! And now he 's as still as a corpse . And I did peep through the keyhole , and he was stretched stark . "

68092	68126	68062	68062	his	2847	" Make a bow - no - a bow , sir ; that is right : you can shake hands another time . Run down , Sophy , and ask for his dinner . "
68127	68134	68136	68136	Sophy	442	" Yes ; that I will ; "
68164	68180	68184	68184	himself	2847	" That will do ; lie down and die . Die this moment , sir . "
68200	68206	68208	68208	Waife	442	" A most splendid investment , "

68297	68306	68308	68308	Sophy	442	" Please let me stay here , Grandy , "
68318	68352	68208	68208	Waife	442	" Nonsense ! it is sixteen hours since he has had a morsel to eat . And he will never bite the hand that feeds him now . Come up , I say . "
68426	68435	68437	68437	Sophy	442	" And how did you come by him ? "
68439	68449	68437	68437	Sophy	442	" and is this really the - the INVESTMENT ? "
68450	68738	69405	69405	Mop	631	" Shut the door carefully , but see first that the woman is not listening . Lie down , sir , there , at the feet of the young lady . Good dog ! How did I come by him ? I will tell you . The first day we arrived at the village which we have just left I went into the tobacconist 's . While I was buying my ounce of canaster that dog entered the shop . In his mouth was a sixpence wrapped in paper . He lifted himself on his hind legs , and laid his missive on the counter . The shopwoman - you know her , Mrs. Traill - unfolded the paper and read the order . ' Clever dog that , sir , ' said she . ' To fetch and carry ? ' said I , indifferently . ' More than that , sir ; you shall see . The order is for two penn'orth of snuff . The dog knows he is to take back fourpence . I will give him a penny short . ' So she took the sixpence and gave the dog threepence out of it . The dog shook his head and looked gravely into her face . ' That 's all you 'll get , ' said she . The dog shook his head again , and tapped his paw once on the counter , as much as to say , ' I 'm not to be done : a penny more , if you please . ' ' If you 'll not take that , you shall have nothing , ' said Mrs. Traill , and she took back the threepence . "
68739	68755	68437	68437	Sophy	442	" Dear ! and what did the dog do then , - snarl or bite ? "
68756	69190	69405	69405	Mop	631	" Not so ; he knew he was in his rights , and did not lower himself by showing bad temper . The dog looked quietly round , saw a basket which contained two or three pounds of candles lying in a corner for the shop boy to take to some customer ; took up the basket in his mouth , and turned tail , as much as to say , ' Tit for tat then . ' He understood , you see , what is called ' the law of reprisals . ' ' Come back this moment , ' cried Mrs. Traill . The dog walked out of the shop ; then she ran after him , and counted the fourpence before him , on which he dropped the basket , picked up the right change , and went off demurely . ' To whom does that poodle belong ? ' said I. ' To a poor drunken man , ' said Mrs. Traill ; ' I wish it was in better hands . ' ' So do I , ma'am , ' answered I ; ' did he teach it ? ' ' No , it was taught by his brother , who was an old soldier , and died in his house two weeks ago . It knows a great many tricks , and is quite young . It might make a fortune as a show , sir . ' So I was thinking . I inquired the owner 's address , called on him , and found him disposed to sell the dog . But he asked L3 , a sum that seemed out of the question then . Still I kept the dog in my eye ; called every day to make friends with it , and ascertain its capacities . And at last , thanks to you , Sophy , I bought the dog ; and what is more , as soon as I had two golden sovereigns to show , I got him for that sum , and we have still L1 . left besides small savings from our lost salaries to go to the completion of his education , and the advertisement of his merits . I kept this a secret from Merle , - from all . I would not even let the drunken owner know where I took the dog to yesterday . I brought him here , where , I learned in the village , there were two rooms to let , locked him up , and my story is told . "
69191	69200	69439	69440	a personage	2853	" But why keep it such a secret ? "
69201	69334	69405	69405	Mop	631	" Because I do n't want Rugge to trace us . He might do one a mischief ; because I have a grand project of genteel position and high prices for the exhibition of that dog . And why should it be known where we come from , or what we were ? And because , if the owner knew where to find the dog , he might decoy it back from us . Luckily he had not made the dog so fond of him but what , unless it be decoyed , it will accustom itself to us . And now I propose that we should stay a week or so here , and devote ourselves exclusively to developing the native powers of this gifted creature . Get out the dominos . "
69335	69341	69439	69440	a personage	2853	" What is his name ? "
69342	69357	69405	69405	Mop	631	" Ha ! that is the first consideration . What shall be his name ? "
69358	69365	69439	69440	a personage	2853	" Has he not one already ? "
69366	69403	69405	69405	Mop	631	" Yes , - trivial and unattractive , - Mop ! In private life it might pass . But in public life - give a dog a bad name and hang him . Mop , indeed ! "
69417	69420	69422	69423	Gentleman Waife	433	" Right , "
69434	69434	69429	69429	you	631	"
69521	69532	69534	69535	Gentleman Waife	433	" The first noticeable defect in your name of Mop , "
69537	69590	69534	69535	Gentleman Waife	433	" is , as you yourself denote , the want of elongation . Monosyllables are not imposing , and in striking compositions their meaning is elevated by periphrasis ; that is to say , Sophy , that what before was a short truth , an elegant author elaborates into a long stretch . "
69591	69594	69596	69596	Sophy	442	" Certainly , "
69600	69620	69596	69596	Sophy	442	" I do n't think the name of Mop would draw ! Still he is very like a mop . "
69621	69784	69881	69881	Sophy	442	" For that reason the name degrades him the more , and lowers him from an intellectual phenomenon to a physical attribute , which is vulgar . I hope that that dog will enable us to rise in the scale of being . For whereas we in acting could only command a threepenny audience - reserved seats a shilling - he may aspire to half - crowns and dress - boxes ; that is , if we can hit on a name which inspires respect . Now , although the dog is big , it is not by his size that he is to become famous , or we might call him Hercules or Goliath ; neither is it by his beauty , or Adonis would not be unsuitable . It is by his superior sagacity and wisdom . And there I am puzzled to find his prototype amongst mortals ; for , perhaps , it may be my ignorance of history - "
69785	69793	69596	69596	Sophy	442	" You ignorant , indeed , Grandfather ! "
69794	69880	69881	69881	Sophy	442	" But considering the innumerable millions who have lived on the earth , it is astonishing how few I can call to mind who have left behind them a proverbial renown for wisdom . There is , indeed , Solomon , but he fell off at the last ; and as he belongs to sacred history , we must not take a liberty with his name . Who is there very , very wise , besides Solomon ? Think , Sophy , - Profane History . "
69888	69893	69881	69881	Sophy	442	" Puss in Boots . "
69894	69927	69881	69881	Sophy	442	" Well , he was wise ; but then he was not human ; he was a cat . Ha ! Socrates . Shall we call him Socrates , Socrates , Socrates ? "
69931	69936	69928	69928	SOPHY	442	" Socrates , Socrates ! "
69943	69954	69940	69940	WAIFE	442	" He do n't take to Socrates , - prosy ! "
69958	69980	69955	69955	SOPHY	442	" Ah , Mr. Merle 's book about the Brazen Head , Friar Bacon ! He must have been very wise . "
69984	70018	69981	69981	WAIFE	442	" Not bad ; mysterious , but not recondite ; historical , yet familiar . What does Mop say to it ? Friar , Friar , Friar Bacon , sir , - Friar ! "
70023	70026	70019	70019	SOPHY	442	" Friar ! "
70081	70090	70078	70078	SOPHY	442	" He does not take to that name . "
70094	70138	70091	70091	WAIFE	442	" He has his reasons for it ; and indeed there are many worthy persons who disapprove of anything that savours of magical practices . Mop intimates that on entering public life one should beware of offending the respectable prejudices of a class . "
70224	70228	70230	70230	Waife	433	" Wonderful intelligence ! "
70232	70246	70230	70230	Waife	433	" he knows that Thales and Bion would not draw ! - obsolete . "
70330	70349	70351	70351	Waife	433	" I am at the end of my list , so far as the wise men are concerned , "
70357	70471	70351	70351	Waife	433	" If Mop were to distinguish himself by valour , one would find heroes by the dozen , - Achilles , and Hector , and Julius Caesar , and Pompey , and Bonaparte , and Alexander the Great , and the Duke of Marlborough . Or , if he wrote poetry , we could fit him to a hair . But wise men certainly are scarce , and when one has hit on a wise man 's name it is so little known to the vulgar that it would carry no more weight with it than Spot or Toby . But necessarily some name the dog must have , and take to sympathetically . "
70512	70590	70509	70509	he	1587	" But after all , Mop 's great strength will probably be in arithmetic , and the science of numbers is the root of all wisdom . Besides , every man , high and low , wants to make a fortune , and associations connected with addition and multiplication are always pleasing . Who , then , is the sage at computation most universally known ? Unquestionably Cocker ! He must take to that , Cocker , Cocker "

70747	70750	70752	70752	Waife	442	" Still , "
70754	70773	70752	70752	Waife	442	" a name connected with profound calculation would be the most appropriate ; for instance , Sir Isaac - "
70808	70811	70813	70813	Waife	442	" Astounding ! "
70818	70833	70813	70813	Waife	442	" Can it be the name ? Impossible . Sir Isaac , Sir Isaac ! "
70834	70839	70841	70841	Mop	631	" Bow - wow ! "
70845	70857	70859	70860	Gentleman Waife	433	" If there be any truth in the doctrine of metempsychosis , "
70862	70879	70859	70860	Gentleman Waife	433	" if the great Newton could have transmigrated into that incomparable animal ! Newton , Newton ! "
70917	70930	70932	70932	Waife	442	" He does not seem to catch at the name of Newton , "
70942	70959	70932	70932	Waife	442	" and yet he seems extremely well versed in the principle of gravity . Sir Isaac ! "
70978	71014	70967	70967	his	2870	" Just cut out those figures carefully , my dear , and see if we can get him to tell us how much twice ten are - I mean by addressing him as Sir Isaac . "
71040	71046	71015	71015	Sophy	442	" Now , Sir Isaac . "
71059	71072	71047	71047	Mop	631	" Now , Sir Isaac , how much are ten times two ? "
71097	71103	71105	71105	Sophy	442	" It is not natural , "
71110	71129	71105	71105	Sophy	442	" It must be wicked , and I 'd rather have nothing to do with it , please . "
71130	71319	71320	71321	Sir Isaac	654	" Silly child ! He was but obeying my sign . He had been taught that trick already under the name of Mop . The only strange thing is , that he should do it also under the name of Sir Isaac , and much more cheerfully too . However , whether he has been the great Newton or not , a live dog is better than a dead lion . But it is clear that , in acknowledging the name of Sir Isaac , he does not encourage us to take that of Newton ; and he is right : for it might be thought unbecoming to apply to an animal , however extraordinary , who by the severity of fortune is compelled to exhibit his talents for a small pecuniary reward , the family name of so great a philosopher . Sir Isaac , after all , is a vague appellation ; any dog has a right to be Sir Isaac - Newton may be left conjectural . Let us see if we can add to our arithmetical information . Look at me , Sir Isaac . "
71664	71669	71652	71652	His	631	" Where is Isaac ? "
71670	71674	71652	71652	His	631	" Call Isaac ! "

72594	72623	72591	72592	Gentleman Waife	433	" that my life has known makeshifts . Once , in a foreign country , I kept poultry , upon the principle that the poultry should keep me . "

72876	72957	72874	72874	he	1587	" a man who has enemies , such as rats are to your chickens : chickens despise rats when raised , as yours are now , above the reach of claws and teeth . Some day or other I may so raise a coop for that little one : I am too old for coops . Meanwhile , if a rat comes sneaking here after us , send it off the wrong way , with a flea in its ear . "

73261	73271	73228	73239	a genteel young man , in a black coat and white neckcloth	2932	" At your service , sir . Spring chickens ? "
73291	73319	73228	73239	a genteel young man , in a black coat and white neckcloth	2932	" Thank you , ma'am ; not at this moment . The fact is , that I call to make some inquiries Have not you lodgers here ? "
73354	73364	73228	73239	a genteel young man , in a black coat and white neckcloth	2932	" No , sir , I ha'n't no lodgers . "
73365	73384	73338	73338	Waife	442	" But you have had some lately , eh ? a crippled elderly man and a little girl . "
73385	73395	73397	73398	Mrs. Saunders	664	" Do n't know anything about them ; leastways , "
73418	73435	73397	73398	Mrs. Saunders	664	" leastways , at this blessed time . Pray , sir , what makes you ask ? "
73436	73561	73338	73338	Waife	442	" Why , I was instructed to come down to - - - , and find out where this person , one William Waife , had gone . Arrived yesterday , ma'am . All I could hear is , that a person answering to his description left the place several days ago , and had been seen by a boy , who was tending sheep , to come down the lane to your house , and you were supposed to have lodgers you take lodgers sometimes , I think , ma'am , because you had been buying some trifling articles of food not in your usual way of custom . Circumstantial evidence , ma'am : you can have no motive to conceal the truth . "
73562	73571	73573	73574	Mrs. Saunders	664	" I should think not indeed , sir , "
73580	73583	73338	73338	Waife	442	" circumstantial evidence "
73590	73631	73573	73574	Mrs. Saunders	664	" I did see a gentleman such as you mention , and a pretty young lady , about ten days agone , or so , and they did lodge here a night or two , but they are gone to - "
73632	73641	73338	73338	Waife	442	" Yes , ma'am , - gone where ? "
73642	73645	73573	73574	Mrs. Saunders	664	" Lunnon . "
73646	73659	73338	73338	Waife	442	" Really - very likely . By the train or on foot ? "
73660	73667	73573	73574	Mrs. Saunders	664	" On foot , I s'pose . "
73668	73725	73338	73338	Waife	442	" Thank you , ma'am . If you should see them again , or hear where they are , oblige me by conveying this card to Mr. Waife . My employer , ma'am , Mr. Gotobed , Craven Street , Strand , - eminent solicitor . He has something of importance to communciate to Mr. Waife . "
73726	73738	73573	73574	Mrs. Saunders	664	" Yes , sir , - a lawyer ; I understand . "
73817	73823	73825	73825	he	2940	" Back to the inn , "
73827	73843	73825	73825	he	2940	" quick : I must be in time for the three o'clock train to London . "
73930	73947	73949	73950	Mr. Gotobed	666	" In London , of course : all people of that kind come back to London , "
73952	73985	73949	73950	Mr. Gotobed	666	" Give me the heads in writing , that I may report to my distinguished client . Most satisfactory . That young man will push his way , - businesslike and methodical . "

See , Sophy , not contented with the bread and cheese to which I bade her stint her beneficence , a whole chicken , - a little cake too for you , Sophy ; she has not even forgotten the salt . Sophy , that woman deserves the handsomest token of our gratitude ; and we will present her with a silver teapot the first moment we can afford it . "
75340	75351	75316	75326	Waife , whose attention was directed that way by the bark	3023	" There is no harm in my dog , sir . "

75548	75571	75545	75545	WAIFE	433	" Yes , sir , travellers . I trust we are not trespassing : this is not private ground , I think ? "
75575	75607	75572	75572	OXONIAN	667	" And if - f - f - f - it were , my f - f - father would not war - n - n you off - ff - f. "
75608	75627	75545	75545	WAIFE	433	" Is it your father 's ground , then ? Sir , I beg you a thousand pardons . "

75890	75951	75887	75887	OXONIAN	667	" On the other side the lane , where the garden slopes downward , is my father 's house . This ground is his property certainly , but he puts it to its best use , in lending it to those who so piously acknowledge that Father from whom all good comes . Your child , I presume , sir ? "
75952	75956	75887	75887	OXONIAN	667	" My grandchild . "
75957	75971	75887	75887	OXONIAN	667	" She seems delicate : I hope you have not far to go ? "
75972	76000	75887	75887	OXONIAN	667	" Not very far , thank you , sir . But my little girl looks more delicate than she is . You are not tired , darling ? "
76001	76008	75887	75887	OXONIAN	667	" Oh , not at all ! "
76036	76049	75887	75887	OXONIAN	667	" Who and what could they be ? so unlike foot wayfarers ! "
76109	76127	76104	76104	he	433	" You are an angler , sir ? I suppose the trout in the stream run small ? "
76128	76145	76146	76146	WAIFE	433	" Not very : a little higher up I have caught them at four pounds weight . "
76149	76166	76146	76146	WAIFE	433	" There goes a fine fish yonder , - see ! balancing himself between those weeds . "
76170	76245	76167	76167	OXONIAN	667	" Poor fellow , let him be safe to - day . After all , it is a cruel sport , and I should break myself of it . But it is strange that whatever our love for Nature we always seek some excuse for trusting ourselves alone to her . A gun , a rod , a sketch - book , a geologist 's hammer , an entomologist 's net , a something . "
76249	76294	76246	76246	WAIFE	433	" Is it not because all our ideas would run wild if not concentrated on a definite pursuit ? Fortune and Nature are earnest females , though popular beauties ; and they do not look upon coquettish triflers in the light of genuine wooers . "
76334	76343	76246	76246	WAIFE	433	" You have a definite pursuit , sir ? "
76344	76394	76295	76296	The Oxonian	3047	" I - alas ! when a man moralizes , it is a sign that he has known error : it is because I have been a trifler that I rail against triflers . And talking of that , time flies , and we must be off and away . "
76426	76439	76442	76443	the angler	3022	" I wish you success in your pursuit , whatever it be , "
76445	76460	76246	76246	WAIFE	433	" And I no less heartily , sir , wish you success in yours . "
76461	76471	76295	76296	The Oxonian	3047	" Mine ! Success there is beyond my power . "
76472	76485	76246	76246	WAIFE	433	" How , sir ? Does it rest so much with others ? "
76486	76532	76295	76296	The Oxonian	3047	" No , my failure is in myself . My career should be the Church , my pursuit the cure of souls , and - and - this pitiful infirmity ! How can I speak the Divine Word - I - I - a stutterer ! "
76576	76583	76585	76586	Gentleman Waife	433	" We all have our burdens , "
76821	76829	76815	76815	his	654	" il faut souffrir pour etre beau . "
76951	76966	76968	76968	Waife	442	" He is to be relied upon , in spite of his French origin , "
76970	77076	76968	76968	Waife	442	" All national prejudice fades before the sense of a common interest . And we shall always find more genuine solidity of character in a French poodle than in an English mastiff , whenever a poodle is of use to us and the mastiff is not . But oh , waste of care ! oh , sacrifice of time to empty names ! oh , emblem of fashionable education ! It never struck me before , - does it not , child though thou art , strike thee now , - by the necessities of our drama , this animal must be a French dog ? "
77077	77082	77490	77490	Sophy	442	" Well , Grandfather ? "
77083	77151	76968	76968	Waife	442	" And we have given him an English name ! Precious result of our own scholastic training , taught at preparatory academies precisely that which avails us naught when we are to face the world ! What is to be done ? Unlearn him his own cognomen , - teach him another name , - too late , too late . We can not afford the delay . "
77152	77176	77490	77490	Sophy	442	" I do n't see why he should be called any name at all . He observes your signs just as well without . "
77177	77422	76968	76968	Waife	442	" If I had but discovered that at the beginning . Pity ! Such a fine name too . Sir Isaac ! Vanitas vanitatum ! What desire chiefly kindles the ambitious ? To create a name , perhaps bequeath a title , - exalt into Sir Isaacs a progeny of slops ! And , after all , it is possible let us hope it in this instance that a sensible young dog may learn his letters and shoulder his musket just as well , though all the appellations by which humanity knows him be condensed into a pitiful monosyllable . Nevertheless as you will find when you are older , people are obliged in practice to renounce for themselves the application of those rules which they philosophically prescribe for others . Thus , while I grant that a change of name for that dog is a question belonging to the policy of Ifs and Buts , commonly called the policy of Expediency , about which one may differ from others and one 's own self every quarter of an hour , a change of name for me belongs to the policy of Must and Shall ; namely the policy of Necessity , against which let no dog bark , - though I have known dogs howl at it ! William Waife is no more : he is dead ; he is buried ; and even Juliet Araminta is the baseless fabric of a vision . "
77431	77489	77426	77426	her	442	" You see before you a man who has used up the name of Waife , and who on entering the town of Gatesboro ' becomes a sober , staid , and respectable personage , under the appellation of Chapman . You are Miss Chapman . Rugge and his Exhibition ' leave not a wrack behind . ' "
77598	77696	77571	77571	she	442	" Take the dog with you , my dear , back into the lane ; I will join you in a few minutes . You are neatly dressed , and , if not , would look so . I , in this old coat , have the air of a pedler , so I will change it , and enter the town of Gatesboro ' in the character of - a man whom you will soon see before you .

Mr. C. may add that of late he has earnestly directed his attention to the best means of extracting new uses from those noble but undeveloped institutions .

81041	81075	81038	81039	the Comedian	1587	" is a subject which requires deep research , and on which a learned man may say much without fear of contradiction . But how far is Gatesboro ' from the British Ocean ? "

81091	81122	81038	81039	the Comedian	1587	" Then , as shells are not familiar to the youthful remembrances of your fellow - townsmen , possibly the lecturer may have found an audience rather select than numerous . "
81123	81151	81177	81177	SHOPMAN	691	" It was a very attentive audience , sir , and highly respectable : Miss Grieve 's young ladies ' the genteelest seminary in the town attended . "
81155	81176	81152	81152	WAIFE	433	" Highly creditable to the young ladies . But , pardon me , is your Athenaeum a Mechanics ' institute ? "
81180	81252	81177	81177	SHOPMAN	691	" It was so called at first . But , somehow or other , the mere operatives fell off , and it was thought advisable to change the word ' Mechanics ' into the word ' Literary . ' Gatesboro ' is not a manufacturing town , and the mechanics here do not realize the expectations of that taste for abstract science on which the originators of these societies founded their - "
81258	81315	81253	81253	WAIFE	433	" Their calculations of intellectual progress and their tables of pecuniary return . Few of these societies , I am told , are really self - supporting : I suppose Professor Long is ! - and if he resides in Gatesboro ' , and writes on limpets , he is probably a man of independent fortune . "
81319	81385	81316	81316	SHOPMAN	691	" Why , sir , the professor was engaged from London , - five guineas and his travelling expenses . The funds of the society could ill afford such outlay ; but we have a most worthy mayor , who , assisted by his foreman , Mr. Williams , our treasurer , is , I may say , the life and soul of the institute . "
81386	81395	81253	81253	WAIFE	433	" A literary man himself , your mayor ? "
81400	81456	81396	81397	The shopman	3202	" Not much in that way , sir ; but anything to enlighten the working classes . This is Professor Long 's great work upon limpets , two vols . post octavo . The Mayor has just presented it to the library of the institute . I was cutting the leaves when you came in . "
81457	81502	81504	81505	the Comedian	1587	" Very prudent in you , sir . If limpets were but able to read printed character in the English tongue , this work would have more interest for them than the ablest investigations upon the political and social history of man . But , "
81512	81541	81504	81505	the Comedian	1587	" the human species is not testaceous ; and what the history of man might be to a limpet , the history of limpets is to a man . "

82738	82741	82743	82744	the Mayor	12758	" Why , "
82749	82774	82743	82744	the Mayor	12758	" I myself am not a man of science , and therefore his lecture , though profound , was a little dry to me . "
82775	82791	82679	82680	his assistant	3266	" Must it not have been still more dry to your workmen , Mr. Mayor ? "
82792	82798	82800	82800	Williams	692	" They did not attend , "

82890	82907	82909	82910	the Comedian	1587	" If a lecture were as amusing as a novel , would not they attend it ? "
82912	82918	82920	82921	Mr. Williams	692	" I suppose they would , "
82923	82936	82920	82921	Mr. Williams	692	" But our object is to instruct ; and instruction , sir - "
82937	82988	82989	82990	Mr. Williams	692	" Could be made amusing . If , for instance , the lecturer could produce a live shell - fish , and , by showing what kindness can do towards developing intellect and affection in beings without soul , - make man himself more kind to his fellow - man ? "
82994	82999	82989	82990	Mr. Williams	692	" Well , sir ! "
83000	83010	82989	82990	Mr. Williams	692	" This is what I should propose to do . "
83011	83018	83020	83021	the Mayor	12758	" With a shell - fish ! "
83023	83039	82989	82990	Mr. Williams	692	" No , sir ; with a creature of nobler attributes , - A DOG ! "
83054	83146	83050	83050	Waife	433	" By winning interest for the individuality of a gifted quadruped , I should gradually create interest in the natural history of its species . I should lead the audience on to listen to comparisons with other members of the great family which once associated with Adam . I should lay the foundation for an instructive course of natural history , and from vertebrated mammifers who knows but we might gradually arrive at the nervous system of the molluscous division , and produce a sensation by the production of a limpet ?

83187	83193	83195	83197	the mild Hartopp	682	" Nothing to speak of , "
83211	83217	83199	83199	Williams	692	" Nothing indeed - oh ! "
83218	83228	83230	83231	the Comedian	1587	" These societies should be wholly self - supporting , "
83233	83243	83230	83231	the Comedian	1587	" and inflict no pecuniary loss upon Mr. Mayor . "
83244	83247	83249	83249	Williams	692	" Certainly , "
83251	83264	83249	83249	Williams	692	" that is the right principle . Mr. Mayor should be protected . "
83265	83280	83199	83199	Williams	692	" And if I show you how to make these societies self - supporting - "
83281	83291	83249	83249	Williams	692	" We should be very much obliged to you . "
83292	83306	83307	83308	Mr. Williams	692	" I propose , then , to give an exhibition at your rooms . "
83326	83340	83249	83249	Williams	692	" Of course gratuitously . I am not a professional lecturer , gentlemen . "
83349	83398	83307	83308	Mr. Williams	692	" And when I have made my first effort successful , as I feel sure it will be , I will leave it to you , gentlemen , to continue my undertaking . But I can not stay long here . If the day after to - morrow - "
83399	83407	83409	83410	the Mayor	12758	" That is our ordinary soiree night , "
83412	83428	83409	83410	the Mayor	12758	" But you said a dog , sir , - dogs not admitted,-eh , Williams ? "
83434	83463	83429	83431	MR . WILLIAMS	692	" A mere by - law , which the subcommittee can suspend if necessary . But would not the introduction of a live animal be less dignified than - "
83464	83469	83472	83473	the Comedian	1587	" A dead failure , "
83509	83517	83519	83521	the latter gentleman	3280	" We are a purely intellectual body , "
83523	83528	83519	83521	the latter gentleman	3280	" and a dog - "
83529	83537	83539	83540	the Mayor	12758	" A learned dog , I presume , "
83548	83584	83542	83544	MR . WILLIAMS	692	" Might form a dangerous precedent for the introduction of other quadrupeds . We might thus descend even to the level of a learned pig . We are not a menagerie , Mr. - Mr. - "
83585	83588	83590	83591	the Mayor	12758	" Chapman , "
83595	83598	83600	83601	the Comedian	1587	" Enough , "
83609	83681	83600	83601	the Comedian	1587	" if I considered myself at liberty , gentlemen , to say who and what I am , you would be sure that I am not trifling with what I consider a very grave and important subject . As to suggesting anything derogatory to the dignity of science , and the eminent repute of the Gatesboro ' Athenaeum , it would be idle to vindicate myself . These gray hairs are - "
83711	83813	83705	83706	the Comedian	1587	" But when you speak of precedent , Mr. Williams , allow me to refer you to precedents in point . Aristotle wrote to Alexander the Great for animals to exhibit to the Literary Institute of Athens . At the colleges in Egypt lectures were delivered on a dog called Anubis , as inferior , I boldly assert , to that dog which I have referred to , as an Egyptian College to a British Institute . The ancient Etrurians , as is shown by the erudite Schweighduser in that passage - you understand Greek , I presume , Mr. Williams ? "
83826	83974	83822	83823	THE COMEDIAN	457	" Then I will not quote that passage in Schweighauser upon the Molossian dogs in general , and the dog of Alcibiades in particular . But it proves beyond a doubt , that , in every ancient literary institute , learned dogs were highly estimated ; and there was even a philosophical Academy called the Cynic , - that is , Doggish , or Dog - school , of which Diogenes was the most eminent professor . He , you know , went about with a lantern looking for an honest man , and could not find one ! Why ? Because the Society of Dogs had raised his standard of human honesty to an impracticable height . But I weary you ; otherwise I could lecture on in this way for the hour together , if you think the Gatesboro ' operatives prefer erudition to amusement . "
83975	83980	83982	83983	Mr. Williams	692	" A great scholar , "
83988	84040	83982	83983	Mr. Williams	692	" and I 've nothing to say against your precedents , sir . I think you have made out that part of the case . But , after all , a learned dog is not so very uncommon as to be in itself the striking attraction which you appear to suppose . "
84041	84056	84058	84059	the Comedian	1587	" It is not the mere learning of my dog of which I boast , "
84061	84140	84141	84143	The grand bow	3287	" Dogs may be learned , and men too ; but it is the way that learning is imparted , whether by dog or man , for the edification of the masses , in order , as Pope expresses himself , ' to raise the genius and to mend the heart ' that alone adorns the possessor , exalts the species , interests the public , and commands the respect of such judges as I see before me . "
84145	84148	84150	84151	Mr. Williams	692	" Ah ! "
84182	84182	84150	84151	Mr. Williams	692	"
84183	84188	84190	84191	the Comedian	1587	" ' Nothing easier ! "
84193	84208	84190	84191	the Comedian	1587	" Will you do me the honour to meet him at tea this evening ? "
84209	84222	84224	84225	the Mayor	12758	" Rather will you not come and take tea at my house ? "
84239	84322	84190	84191	the Comedian	1587	" You are very kind ; but my time is so occupied that I have long since made it a rule to decline all private invitations out of my own home . At my years , Mr. Mayor , one may be excused for taking leave of society and its forms ; but you are comparatively young men . I presume on the authority of these gray hairs , and I shall expect you this evening , - say at nine o'clock . "
84332	84339	84341	84341	Williams	692	" A scholar AND a gentleman , "
84361	84473	84346	84347	the Mayor	12758	" A humourist , and a pleasant one . Perhaps he is right , and our poor operatives would thank us more for a little innocent amusement than for those lectures , which they may be excused for thinking rather dull , since even you fell asleep when Professor Long got into the multilocular shell of the very first class of cephalous mollusca ; and it is my belief that harmless laughter has a good moral effect upon the working class , - only do n't spread it about that I said so , for we know excellent persons of a serious turn of mind whose opinions that sentiment might shock . "
84480	84492	84548	84548	I	0	" Is Gentleman Waife a swindler or a man of genius ? "
84495	84506	84548	84548	I	0	" Certainly a swindler , if he do n't succeed . "
85028	85031	85033	85033	Williams	692	" And , "

85132	85137	85139	85140	the Mayor	12758	" It will take , "

85150	85153	85155	85155	Williams	692	" Yes , "
85157	85192	85155	85155	Williams	692	" and though for that very reason some might think that by the ' live example of a dog ' we compromised the dignity of the Institute , still the importance of Natural History - "

85285	85334	85250	85250	Waife	433	" Do n't be too sanguine . I distributed bills on behalf of Professor Long , and the audience was not numerous . How ever , I will do my best . Is there nothing more in which I can be of use to you , Mr. Chapman ? "
85335	85340	85341	85341	Williams	692	" Yes , later . "
85363	85417	85355	85356	The Comedian	1587	" I intend to give the Mayor a little outline of the exhibition , and bring him into it , in order that his fellow - townsmen may signify their regard for him by a cheer ; it will please his good heart , and be touching , you 'll see - mum ! "

True , he is not a Frenchman ; he is one of a land you will not love less than France , - it is your own . He , too , has a child whom he would save from famine . He , too , has nothing left to sell or to pawn for bread , - except - oh , not this gilded badge , see , this is only foil and cardboard , - except , I say , the thing itself , of which you respect even so poor a symbol , - nothing left to sell or to pawn but Honour ! For these I have pleaded this night as a showman ; for these , less haughty than the Frenchman , I stretch my hands towards you without shame ; for these I am a beggar . "

93659	93688	93646	93647	THE COMEDIAN	1587	" Down , Sir Isaac , down ! This visit , Mr. Mayor , is an honour which may well take a dog by surprise ! Forgive him ! "
93739	93820	93732	93733	Mr. Hartopp	682	" Your dog is a very admirable and clever animal ; but in the exhibition of a learned dog there is something which tends to sadden one . By what privations has he been forced out of his natural ways ? By what fastings and severe usage have his instincts been distorted into tricks ? Hunger is a stern teacher , Mr. Chapman ; and to those whom it teaches , we can not always give praise unmixed with pity . "
93850	93906	93841	93841	he	682	" You speak like an oracle , Mr. Mayor ; but that dog , at least , has been mildly educated and kindly used . Inborn genius , sir , will have its vent . Hum ! a most intelligent audience honoured us to - night ; and our best thanks are due to you . "
93912	94133	93907	93909	MR . HARTOPP	682	" Mr. Chapman , let us be frank with each other . I am not a clever man ; perhaps a dull one . If I had set up for a clever man , I should not be where I am now . Hush ! no compliments . But my life has brought me into frequent contact with those who suffer ; and the dullest of us gain a certain sharpness in the matters to which our observation is habitually drawn . You took me in at first , it is true . I thought you were a philanthropical humourist , who might have crotchets , as many benevolent men , with time on their hands and money in their pockets , are apt to form . But when it came to the begging hat I ask your pardon ; do n't let me offend you , when it came to the begging hat , I recognized the man who wants philanthropy from others , and whose crotchets are to be regarded in a professional point of view . Sir , I have come here alone , because I alone perhaps see the case as it really is . Will you confide in me ? you may do it safely . To be plain , who and what are you ? "
94139	94192	94134	94135	THE COMEDIAN	1587	" What do you take me for , Mr. Mayor ? What can I be other than an itinerant showman , who has had resort to a harmless stratagem in order to obtain an audience , and create a surprise that might cover the naked audacity of the ' begging hat ' ! "
94199	94231	94193	94195	MR . HARTOPP	682	" When a man of your ability and education is reduced to such stratagems , he must have committed some great faults . Pray Heaven it be no worse than faults ! "
94237	94488	94232	94233	THE COMEDIAN	1587	" That is always the way with the prosperous . Is a man unfortunate ? They say , ' Why do n't he help himself ? ' Does he try to help himself ? They say , ' With so much ability , why does not he help himself better ? ' Ability and education ! Snares and springes , Mr. Mayor ! Ability and education ! the two worst mantraps that a poor fellow can put his foot into ! Aha ! Did not you say if you had set up to be clever , you would not be where you now are : ' A wise saying ; I admire you for it . Well , well , I and my dog have amused your townsfolk ; they have amply repaid us . We are public servants ; according as we act in public - hiss us or applaud . Are we to submit to an inquisition into our private character ? Are you to ask how many mutton bones has that dog stolen ? how many cats has he worried ? or how many shirts has the showman in his wallet ? how many debts has he left behind him ? what is his rent - roll on earth , and his account with Heaven ? Go and put those questions to ministers , philosophers , generals , poets . When they have acknowledged your right to put them , come to me and the other dog . "
94500	94581	94489	94491	MR . HARTOPP	682	" I beg your pardon ! I have done , sir . And yet I conceived an interest in you . It is because I have no talents myself that I admire those who have . I felt a mournful anxiety , too , for your poor little girl , - so young , so engaging . And is it necessary that you should bring up that child in a course of life certainly equivocal , and to females dangerous ? "
94648	94687	94627	94627	He	1587	" And have you no alarm for her health ? Do you not see how delicate she is ? Do you not see that her very talent comes from her susceptibility to emotions which must wear her away ? "
94688	94936	94956	94958	the good magistrate	3674	WAIFE.-"No , no ! stop , stop , stop ! you terrify me , you break my heart . Man , man ! it is all for her that I toil and show and beg , - if you call it begging . Do you think I care what becomes of this battered hulk ? Not a straw . What am I to do ? What ! what ! You tell me to confide in you ; wherefore ? How can you help me ? Would you give me employment ? What am I fit for ? Nothing ! You could find work and bread for an Irish labourer , nor ask who or what he was ; but to a man who strays towards you , seemingly from a sphere in which , if Poverty enters , she drops a courtesy , and is called ' genteel , ' you cry , ' Hold , produce your passport ; where are your credentials , references ? ' I have none . I have slipped out of the world I once moved in . I can no more appeal to those I knew in it than if I had transmigrated from one of yon stars , and said , ' See there what I was once ! ' Oh , but you do not think she looks ill ! - do you ? do you ? Wretch that I am ! And I thought to save her ! "
94971	95099	94956	94958	the good magistrate	3674	" Cheer up : where there is a will there is a way ; you justify the opinion I formed in your favour despite all circumstances to the contrary . When I asked you to confide in me , it was not from curiosity , but because I would serve you if I can . Reflect on what I have said . True , you can know but little of me . Learn what is said of me by my neighbours before you trust me further . For the rest , to - morrow you will have many proposals to renew your performance . Excuse me if I do not actively encourage it . I will not , at least , interfere to your detriment ; but - "
95100	95103	95105	95105	Waife	442	" But , "
95113	95145	95105	95105	Waife	442	" but you think she looks ill ? you think this is injuring her ? you think I am murdering my grandchild , - my angel of life , my all ? "
95146	95158	94956	94958	the good magistrate	3674	" Not so ; I spoke too bluntly . Yet still - "
95159	95167	95105	95105	Waife	442	" Yes , yes , yet still - "
95168	95209	94956	94958	the good magistrate	3674	" Still , if you love her so dearly , would you blunt her conscience and love of truth ? Were you not an impostor tonight ? Would you ask her to reverence and imitate and pray for an impostor ? "
95210	95219	95221	95221	Waife	442	" I never saw it in that light ! "
95228	95238	95221	95221	Waife	442	" never , never , so help me Heaven ! "
95239	95247	95249	95250	the Mayor	12758	" I felt sure you did not , "
95252	95317	95249	95250	the Mayor	12758	" you saw but the sport of the thing ; you took to it as a schoolboy . I have known many such men , with high animal spirits like yours . Such men err thoughtlessly ; but did they ever sin consciously , they could not keep those high spirits ! Good night , Mr. Chapman , I shall hear from you again . "
95612	95622	95623	95623	he	12758	" Who did you say was the best here ? "
95636	95644	95623	95623	he	12758	" Sir ! the best - what ? "
95645	95687	95689	95689	his	12758	" The best doctor , ma'am ; none of your parish apothecaries , - the best physician , - Dr. Gill , - did you say Gill ? Thank you ; his address , High Street . Close by , ma'am . "

96209	96212	96157	96162	the second wayfarer in that desert	3710	" Strange ! "
96213	96258	96192	96194	the sprucer wayfarer	3712	" Very strange indeed that more than one person can , in this busy age , employ himself in discovering a Podden Place ! Not a soul to inquire of , - not a shop that I see , not an orange - stall ! "

97363	97379	97380	97380	He	3746	" I am Jasper Losely , more bronzed of cheek , more iron of hand . "
97426	97441	97382	97382	his	3746	" Is your mistress up stairs ? show me to her room , or - "
97481	97495	97540	97542	A haggard face	3755	" Mistress , mistress ! here is Mr. Losely ! Jasper Losely himself ! "
97702	97705	97720	97721	Jasper Losely	721	" So , "
97727	97727	97720	97721	Jasper Losely	721	"
97800	97815	97795	97795	He	3746	" There , there , let us sit down , my dear Mrs. Crane . "
97816	97824	97973	97973	she	482	" And once I was called Bella . "
97825	97901	97795	97795	He	3746	" Ages ago ! Basta ! All things have their end . Do take those eyes of yours off my face ; they were always so bright ! and - really - now they are perfect burning - glasses ! How close it is ! Peuh ! I am dead tired . May I ask for a glass of water ; a drop of wine in it - or - brandy will do as well . "
97902	97918	97920	97921	Mrs. Crane	482	" Ho ! you have come to brandy and morning drams , eh , Jasper ? "
97930	97968	97920	97921	Mrs. Crane	482	" I , too , once tried if fire could burn up thought , but it did not succeed with me ; that is years ago ; and - there - see the bottles are full still ! "
97984	97988	98036	98036	she	482	" genteel lodgings , "
98515	98519	98616	98617	Mr. Losely	721	" lessons for beginners "
98608	98614	98624	98624	he	3764	" Basta , eno ' , "
98632	98649	98661	98661	she	730	" to business . Let me see the child : I feel up to it now . "
98664	98681	98661	98661	she	730	" The child ! she is not here ! I have disposed of her long ago . "
98682	98695	98744	98744	She	730	" Eh ! - disposed of her ! what do you mean ? "
98696	98743	98744	98744	She	730	" Do you ask as if you feared I had put her out of the world ? No ! Well , then , - you come to England to see the child ? You miss - you love , the child of that - of that - "
98757	98786	98661	98661	she	730	" of that honest , high - minded gentlewoman whose memory must be so dear to me , - you love that child ; very natural , Jasper . "
98787	98843	98744	98744	She	730	" Love her ! a child I have scarcely seen since she was born ! do talk common - sense . No . But have I not told you that she ought to be money 's worth to me ; ay , and she shall be yet , despite that proud man 's disdainful insolence . "
98844	98867	98661	98661	she	730	" That proud man ! what , you have ventured to address him - visit him - since your return to England ? "
98868	98914	98744	98744	She	730	" Of course . That 's what brought me over . I imagined the man would rejoice at what I told him , open his pursestrings , lavish blessings and bank - notes . And the brute would not even believe me ; all because - "
98915	98976	98661	98661	she	730	" Because you had sold the right to be believed before . I told you , when I took the child , that you would never succeed there , that - I would never encourage you in the attempt . But you had sold the future as you sold your past , - too cheaply , it seems , Jasper . "
98977	99000	98744	98744	She	730	" Too cheaply , indeed . Who could ever have supposed that I should have been fobbed off with such a pittance ? "
99001	99074	99121	99121	she	3782	" Who , indeed , Jasper ! You were made to spend fortunes , and call them pittances when spent , Jasper ! You should have been a prince , Jasper ; such princely tastes ! Trinkets and dress , horses and dice , and plenty of ladies to look and die ! Such princely spirit too ! bounding all return for loyal sacrifice to the honour you vouchsafed in accepting it ! "
99137	99154	99413	99414	Mr. Losely	721	" Ah , but you are altered from those days ; see what you then were ! "
99387	99411	99433	99433	he	3158	" And I was like this ! True ! I remember well when it was taken , and no one called it flattering , "
99422	99432	99433	99433	he	3158	" But I ca n't be very much changed , "
99441	99454	99465	99466	Mrs. Crane	482	" At my age one may have a manlier look , yet - "
99455	99463	99465	99466	Mrs. Crane	482	" Yet still be handsome , Jasper , "
99468	99482	99433	99433	he	3158	" You are so . But look at me ; what am I ? "
99483	99540	99465	99466	Mrs. Crane	482	" Oh , a very fine woman , my dear Crane , - always were . But you neglect yourself : you should not do that ; keep it up to the last . Well , but to return to the child . You have disposed of her without my consent , without letting me know ? "
99541	99568	99433	99433	he	3158	" Letting you know ! How many years is it since you even gave me your address ! Never fear : she is in good hands . "
99569	99580	99465	99466	Mrs. Crane	482	" Whose ? At all events I must see her . "
99581	99588	99433	99433	he	3158	" See her ! What for ? "
99589	99650	99465	99466	Mrs. Crane	482	" What for ! Hang it , it is natural that , now I am in England , I should at least wish to know what she is like . And I think it very strange that you should send her away , and then make all these difficulties . What 's your object ? I do n't understand it . "
99651	99793	99433	99433	he	3158	" My object ? What could be my object but to serve you ? At your request I took , fed , reared a child , whom you could not expect me to love , at my own cost . Did I ever ask you for a shilling ? Did I ever suffer you to give me one ? Never ! At last , hearing no more from you , and what little I heard of you making me think that , if anything happened to me and I was very ill at the time , you could only find her a burden , - at last I say , the old man came to me , - you had given him my address , - and he offered to take her , and I consented . She is with him . "
99794	99809	99465	99466	Mrs. Crane	482	" The old man ! She is with him ! And where is he ? "
99810	99816	99433	99433	he	3158	" I do n't know . "
99817	99832	99465	99466	Mrs. Crane	482	" Humph ; how does he live ? Can he have got any money ? "
99833	99839	99433	99433	he	3158	" I do n't know . "
99840	99849	99465	99466	Mrs. Crane	482	" Did any old friends take him up ? "
99850	99858	99902	99902	he	3794	" Would he go to old friends ? "
99907	99962	99433	99433	he	3158	" Well , upon the whole , I do n't see what I could do with the girl just at present , though , of course , I ought to know where she is , and with whom . Tell me , Mrs. Crane , what is she like , - pretty or plain ? "
99963	99980	99989	99989	Losely	721	" I suppose the chit would be called pretty , - by some persons at least . "
99981	99987	99989	99989	Losely	721	" Very pretty ? handsome ? "
99993	100021	100090	100090	she	482	" Handsome or not , what does it signify ? what good comes of beauty ? You had beauty enough ; what have you done with it ? "
100093	100121	100090	100090	she	482	" And now that you are satisfied about her , have you no questions to ask about me ? - what I do ? how I live ? "
100122	100178	100090	100090	she	482	" My dear Mrs. Crane , I know that you are comfortably off , and were never of a mercenary temper . I trust you are happy , and so forth : I wish I were ; things do n't prosper with me . If you could conveniently lend me a five - pound note - "
100179	100236	100246	100246	He	3795	" You would borrow of me , Jasper ? Ah ! you come to me in your troubles . You shall have the money , - five pounds , ten pounds , what you please , but you will call again for it : you need me now ; you will not utterly desert me now ? "
100237	100245	100254	100254	She	3796	" Best of creatures ! - never ! "
100274	100296	100254	100254	She	3796	" But are you really in want ? - you are well - dressed , Jasper ; that you always were . "
100297	100319	100254	100254	She	3796	" Not always ; three days ago very much the reverse : but I have had a trifling aid , and - "
100320	100343	100386	100386	his	3795	" Aid in England ? from whom ? where ? Not from him whom you say you had the courage to seek ? "
100344	100381	100386	100386	his	3795	" From whom else ? Have I no claim ? A miserable alms flung to me . Curse him ! I tell you that man 's look and language so galled me , - so galled , "
100415	100439	100445	100446	Mrs. Crane	482	" that , if his eye had quitted mine for a moment , I think I must have brained him , and been - "
100440	100443	100456	100456	Losely	721	" Hanged ! "
100448	100454	100386	100386	his	3795	" Of course , hanged , "
100490	100520	100610	100610	she	721	" But if a man did not sometimes forget consequences , there would be an end of the gallows . I am glad that his eye never left mine . "
100617	100665	100698	100699	Mr. Losely	721	" Poor Jasper ! Is all the vain ambition that made you so false shrunk into a ferocity that finds you so powerless ? Would your existence , after all , have been harder , poorer , meaner , if your faith had been kept to me ? "
100702	100804	100937	100937	She	1477	" Pshaw ! Bella , pshaw ! I was a fool , I dare say , and a sad dog , a very sad dog ; but I had always the greatest regard for you , and always shall ! Hillo , what 's that ? A knock at the door ! Oh , by the by , a queer - looking man , in a white hat , called at the same time I did , to see you on private business , gave way to me , said he should come again ; may I ask who he is ? "
100805	100824	100825	100829	The old woman - servant	3798	" I can not guess ; no one ever calls here on business except the tax - gatherer . "
100833	100845	100698	100699	Mr. Losely	721	" A gentleman , ma'am ; says his name is Rugge . "
100846	100856	100867	100868	the manager	1477	" Rugge , - Rugge ; let me think . "
100857	100865	100867	100868	the manager	1477	" I am here , Mrs. Crane , "
100873	100901	100698	100699	Mr. Losely	721	" You do n't , perhaps , call me to mind by name ; but - oho ! not gone , sir ! Do I intrude prematurely ? "
100902	100918	100867	100868	the manager	1477	" No , I have done ; good - day , my dear Mrs. Crane . "
100919	100936	100937	100937	She	1477	" Stay , Jasper . I remember you now , Mr. Rugge ; take a chair . "
100957	100976	100698	100699	Mr. Losely	721	" I saw you at Mr. Waife 's lodging , at the time he had that bad accident . "
100977	101001	100937	100937	She	1477	" And I had the honour to accompany you home , ma'am , and - but shall I speak out before this gentleman ? "
101002	101039	101040	101040	LOSELY	721	" Certainly ; you see he is listening to you with attention . This gentleman and I have no secrets from each other . What has become of that person ? This gentleman wishes to know . "
101043	101055	101056	101056	RUGGE	438	" Yes , sir , I wish to know - particularly . "
101059	101094	101095	101095	LOSELY	721	" So do I ; that is partly what I came about . You are aware , I think , ma'am , that I engaged him and Juliet Araminta , that is , Sophy . "
101098	101109	101110	101110	RUGGE	438	" Sophy ? engaged them , sir , - how ? "
101113	101135	101136	101136	LOSELY	721	" Theatrical line , sir , - Rugge 's Exhibition ; he was a great actor once , that fellow Waife . "
101139	101151	101172	101173	the lady	3801	" Oh , actor ! well , sir , go on . "
101183	101313	101314	101316	MRS . CRANE	482	" But he became a wreck , a block of a man ; lost an eye and his voice too . How ever , to serve him , I took his grandchild and him too . He left me - shamefully , and ran off with his grandchild , sir . Now , ma'am , to be plain with you , that little girl I looked upon as my property , - a very valuable property . She is worth a great deal to me , and I have been done out of her . If you can help me to get her back , articled and engaged say for three years , I am willing and happy , ma'am , to pay something handsome , - uncommon handsome . "
101320	101332	101333	101333	LOSELY	721	" Speak to that gentleman ; he may treat with you . "
101336	101349	101350	101350	RUGGE	438	" What do you call uncommon handsome , Mr. - Mr. Tugge ? "
101353	101380	101381	101381	LOSELY	721	" Rugge ! Sir ; we sha'n't disagree , I hope , provided you have the power to get Waife to bind the girl to me . "
101384	101451	101452	101452	RUGGE	438	" I may have the power to transfer the young lady to your care - young lady is a more respectful phrase than girl - and possibly to dispense with Mr. Waife 's consent to such arrangement . But excuse me if I say that I must know a little more of yourself , before I could promise to exert such a power on your behalf . "
101455	101909	101910	101910	LOSELY	721	" Sir , I shall be proud to improve our acquaintance . As to Waife , the old vagabond , he has injured and affronted me , sir . I do n't bear malice , but I have a spirit : Britons have a spirit , sir . And you will remember , ma'am , that when I accompanied you home , I observed that Mr. Waife was a mysterious man , and had apparently known better days , and that when a man is mysterious , and falls into the sear and yellow leaf , ma'am , without that which should accompany old age , sir , one has a right to suspect that some time or other , he has done something or other , ma'am , which makes him fear lest the very stones prate of his whereabout , sir . And you did not deny , ma'am , that the mystery was suspicious ; but you said , with uncommon good sense , that it was nothing to me what Mr. Waife had once been , so long as he was of use to me at that particular season . Since then , sir , he has ceased to be of use , - ceased , too , in the unhandsomest manner . And if you would , ma'am , from a sense of justice , just unravel the mystery , put me in possession of the secret , it might make that base man of use to me again , give me a handle over him , sir , so that I might awe him into restoring my property , as , morally speaking , Juliet Araminta most undoubtedly is . That 's why I call , - leaving my company , to which I am a father , orphans for the present . But I have missed that little girl , - that young lady , sir . I called her a phenomenon , ma'am ; missed her much : it is natural , sir , I appeal to you . No man can be done out of a valuable property and not feel it , if he has a heart in his bosom . And if I had her back safe , I should indulge ambition . I have always had ambition . The theatre at York , sir , - that is my ambition ; I had it from a child , sir ; dreamed of it three tunes , ma'am . If I had back my property in that phenomenon , I would go at the thing , slap - bang , take the York , and bring out the phenomenon with A CLAW ! "
101914	101947	101948	101948	RUGGE	438	" You say the young lady is a phenomenon , and for this phenomenon you are willing to pay something handsome , - a vague expression . Put it into L. s. d. "
101951	101986	101993	101993	his	3805	" Sir , if she can be bound to me legally for three years , I would give L100 . I did offer to Waife L50 , - to you , sir , L100 . "
101998	102013	102014	102014	RUGGE	438	" But , confound it , where is she ? Have you no clew ? "
102017	102059	102098	102098	She	482	" No , but we can easily find one ; it was not worth my while to hunt them up before I was quite sure that , if I regained my property in that phenomenon , the law would protect it . "
102069	102097	102098	102098	She	482	" Well , Jasper Losely , you will sell the young lady , I doubt not ; and when you have sold her , let me know . "
102104	102137	102154	102155	Mrs. Crane	482	" You will not perhaps now want money from me , but I shall see you again ; for , if you would find the child , you will need my aid . "
102138	102153	102228	102228	Rugge	438	" Certainly , my dear friend , I will call again ; honour bright . "
102223	102226	102228	102228	Rugge	438	" Sir , "
102233	102281	102288	102288	Losely	721	" what do you say to a chop and a pint of wine ? Perhaps we could talk more at our ease elsewhere . I am only in town for a day ; left my company thirty miles off , - orphans , as I said before . "
102282	102286	102288	102288	Losely	721	" Mr. Rugge , "
102290	102347	102228	102228	Rugge	438	" I have no desire to stay in London , or indeed in England ; and the sooner we can settle this matter the better . Grant that we find the young lady , you provide for her board and lodging ; teach her your honourable profession ; behave , of course , kindly to her . "
102348	102353	102288	102288	Losely	721	" Like a father . "
102354	102364	102228	102228	Rugge	438	" And give to me the sum of L100 ? "
102365	102396	102288	102288	Losely	721	" That is , if you can legally make her over to me . But , sir , may I inquire by what authority you would act in this matter ? "
102397	102429	102228	102228	Rugge	438	" On that head it will be easy to satisfy you ; meanwhile I accept your proposal of an early dinner . Let us adjourn ; is it to your house ? "
102430	102450	102288	102288	Losely	721	" I have no exact private house in London ; but I know a public one , - commodious . "
102451	102461	102484	102485	the woman	2842	" Be it so . After you , sir . "
102489	102496	102484	102485	the woman	2842	" Do you find her altered ? "
102497	102524	102484	102485	the woman	2842	" Whom ? Mrs. Crane ? - why , years will tell . But you seem to have known me ; I do n't remember you . "
102525	102530	102484	102485	the woman	2842	" Not Bridget Greggs ? "
102531	102571	102484	102485	the woman	2842	" Is it possible ? I left you a middle - aged , rosy - faced woman . True , I recognize you now . There 's a crown for you . I wish I had more to spare ! "
102578	102599	102788	102788	she	730	" No ; I dare not ! Take money from you , Jasper Losely ! Mistress would not forgive me ! "
102782	102787	102871	102871	she	730	" How it beats ! "
102791	102870	102884	102884	she	730	" if in love or in hate , in scorn or in pity , beats once more with a human emotion . He will come again ; whether for money or for woman 's wit , what care I ? - he will come . I will hold , I will cling to him , no more to part ; for better for worse , as it should have been once at the altar . And the child ? "
102879	102883	102884	102884	she	730	" The child ! "
102896	102979	103089	103089	his	438	" the child of that treacherous , hateful mother , - yes ! I will help him to sell her back as a stage - show , - help him in all that does not lift her to a state from which she may look down with disdain on me . Revenge on her , on that cruel house : revenge is sweet . Oh ! that it were revenge alone that bids me cling to him who deserves revenge the most . "
103065	103068	103170	103171	Mr. Rugge	438	" orphans , "
103159	103168	103270	103271	Mrs. Crane	482	" Set a female to catch a female , "
103262	103268	103270	103271	Mrs. Crane	482	" That woman deceives us , "
103277	103347	103353	103354	Mr. Rugge	438	" They have not gone to London . What could they do there ? Any man with a few stage juggling tricks can get on in country villages but would be lost in cities . Perhaps , as it seems he has got a dog , - we have found out that from Mrs. Saunders , - he will make use of it for an itinerant puppet - show . "
103348	103351	103353	103354	Mr. Rugge	438	" Punch ! "
103356	103363	103371	103372	Mrs. Crane	482	" not a doubt of it . "

103374	103420	103371	103372	Mrs. Crane	482	" they are probably not far off . Let us print handbills , offering a reward for their clew , and luring the old man himself by an assurance that the inquiry is made in order that he may learn of something to his advantage . "
103469	103616	103728	103729	the gentleman	11276	" If William Waife , who left - on the 20th ult . , will apply at the Red Lion Inn at - - - - , for X. X. , he will learn of something greatly to his advantage . A reward of L5 will be given to any one who will furnish information where the said William Waife and the little girl who accompanies him may be found . The said William Waife is about sixty years of age , of middle stature , strongly built , has lost one eye , and is lame of one leg . The little girl , called Sophy , is twelve years old , but looks younger ; has blue eyes and light brown hair . They had with them a white French poodle dog . This bill is printed by the friends of the missing party . "

103783	103788	103791	103792	Mrs. Crane	482	" Am X. X. , "
103797	103836	103980	103982	MRS . CRANE	482	" one of the friends of Mr. Waife , by whom the handbill has been circulated ; it will indeed be a great relief to us to know where they are , - the little girl more especially . "
103986	104013	104043	104043	she	482	" I fear they must be badly off . I hope they are not wanting the necessaries of life . But pray be seated , sir . "
104050	104063	104043	104043	she	482	" A clergyman of the Established Church , I presume , sir ? "
104077	104161	104162	104163	Mrs. CRANE	482	" With this defect , ma'am ! - But to the point . Some days ago I happened to fall in with an elderly person , such as is described , with a very pretty female child and a French dog . The man - gentleman , perhaps I may call him , judging from his conversation - interested me much ; so did the little girl . And if I could be the means of directing real friends anxious to serve them - "
104166	104182	104183	104183	OXONIAN	667	" You would indeed be a benefactor . And where are they now , sir ? "
104186	104224	104246	104247	the scholar	3036	" That I can not positively tell you . But before I say more , will you kindly satisfy my curiosity ? He is perhaps an eccentric person , - this Mr. Waife ? - a little - "
104250	104264	104265	104267	MRS . CRANE	482	" Because , in that case , I should not like to interfere . "
104270	104333	104334	104334	OXONIAN	667	" Quite right , sir . His own friends would not interfere with his roving ways , his little whims on any account . Poor man , why should they ? He has no property for them to covet . But it is a long story . I had the care of that dear little girl from her infancy , sweet child ! "
104337	104342	104343	104345	MRS . CRANE	482	" So she seems . "
104348	104393	104394	104394	OXONIAN	667	" And now she has a most comfortable home provided for her ; and a young girl , with good friends , ought not to be tramping about the country , whatever an old man may do . You must allow that , sir ? "
104397	104422	104423	104425	MRS . CRANE	482	" Well , - yes , I allow that ; it occurred to me . But what is the man ? - the gentleman ? "
104428	104464	104465	104465	OXONIAN	667	" Very ' eccentric , ' as you say , and inconsiderate , perhaps , as to the little girl . We will not call it insane , sir . But - are you married ? "
104469	104474	104475	104477	MRS . CRANE	482	" No , ma'am . "
104480	104489	104490	104490	OXONIAN	667	" But you have a sister , perhaps ? "
104493	104501	104502	104504	MRS . CRANE	482	" Yes ; I have one sister . "
104507	104535	104536	104536	OXONIAN	667	" Would you like your sister to be running about the country in that way , - carried off from her home , kindred , and friends ? "
104539	104582	104583	104585	MRS . CRANE	482	" Ah ! I understand . The poor little girl is fond of the old man , - a relation , grandfather perhaps ? and he has taken her from her home ; and though not actually insane , he is still - "
104588	104621	104638	104638	she	482	" An unsafe guide for a female child , delicately reared . I reared her ; of good prospects , too . O sir , let us save the child ! Look - "
104654	104807	104808	104810	MRS . CRANE	482	" I see , ma'am . I can not hesitate after this . It is a good many miles off where I met the persons whom I have no doubt that you seek ; and two or three days ago my father received a letter from a very worthy , excellent man , with whom he is often brought into communication upon benevolent objects , - a Mr. Hartopp , the Mayor of Gatesboro ' , in which , among other matters , the Mayor mentioned briefly that the Literary Institute of that town had been much delighted by the performance of a very remarkable man with one eye , about whom there seemed some mystery , with a little girl and a learned dog ; and I ca n't help thinking that the man , the girl , and the dog , must be those whom I saw and you seek . "
104813	104822	104808	104810	MRS . CRANE	482	" At Gatesboro ' ? is that far ? "
104826	104864	104865	104867	MRS . CRANE	482	" Some way ; but you can get a cross train from this village . I hope that the old man will not be separated from the little girl ; they seemed very fond of each other . "
104870	104923	104865	104867	MRS . CRANE	482	" No doubt of it ; very fond : it would be cruel to separate them . A comfortable home for both . I do n't know , sir , if I dare offer to a gentleman of your evident rank the reward , - but for the poor of your parish . "
104927	104985	104986	104988	MRS . CRANE	482	" Oh , ma'am , our poor want for nothing : my father is rich . But if you would oblige me by a line after you have found these interesting persons ; I am going to a distant part of the country to - morrow , - to Montfort Court , in - - - -shire . "
104991	105005	105006	105006	OXONIAN	667	" To Lord Montfort , the head of the noble family of Vipont ? "
105009	105040	105041	105043	MRS . CRANE	482	" Yes ; do you know any of the family , ma'am ? If you could refer me to one of them , I should feel more satisfied as to - "
105047	105088	105089	105089	OXONIAN	667	" Indeed , sir , every one must know that great family by name and repute . I know no more . So you are going to Lord Montfort 's ! The Marchioness , they say , is very beautiful . "
105092	105138	105139	105140	Mrs. Crane	482	" And good as beautiful . I have the honour to be connected both with her and Lord Montfort ; they are cousins , and my grandfather was a Vipont . I should have told you my name , - Morley ; George Vipont Morley . "
105163	105195	105206	105208	George Vipont Morley	562	" So it is to one of that noble family - to a Vipont - that the dear child will owe her restoration to my embrace ! Bless you , sir ! "
105196	105204	105226	105226	he	562	" I hope I have done right , "
105216	105225	105248	105248	he	562	" I must have done right , surely ! "
105238	105247	105315	105315	he	562	" I fear I have not done right , "
105310	105314	105315	105315	he	562	" After all , "
105319	105327	105336	105336	His	562	" it was no business of mine . "
105328	105335	105336	105336	His	562	" I meant well ; but - "
105347	105386	105554	105555	Mr. Mayor	686	" Yes , I did quite right . How should I like my sister to be roving the country , and acting at Literary Institutes ' with a poodle dog ? Quite right ; kiss me , Jane ! "

106184	106202	106338	106340	MR . HARTOPP	682	" Mr. Chapman calls by appointment . Perhaps he may have something to say to me confidentially . "
106343	106353	106354	106354	WAIFE	442	" What is the matter ? What has happened ? "
106357	106378	106379	106381	MR . HARTOPP	682	" She is very ill , - in a bad way ; the doctor says so , - Dr. Gill . "
106385	106456	106457	106457	WAIFE	442	" Your little girl in a bad way ! Oh , no ; doctors always exaggerate in order to get more credit for the cure . Not that I would disparage Dr. Gill , fellow - townsman , first - rate man . Still ' t is the way with doctors to talk cheerfully if one is in danger , and to look solemn if there is nothing to fear . "
106460	106487	106488	106490	MR . HARTOPP	682	" DO you think so : you have children of your own , sir ? - of her age , too ? - Eh ! eh ! "
106493	106518	106519	106519	WAIFE	442	" Yes ; I know all about children , - better , I think , than Mrs. H. does . What is the complaint ? "
106522	106531	106532	106534	MR . HARTOPP	682	" The doctor says it is low fever . "
106537	106545	106546	106546	WAIFE	442	" Caused by nervous excitement , perhaps . "
106551	106564	106565	106567	MR . HARTOPP	682	" Yes : that 's what he says , - nervous excitement . "
106570	106613	106614	106614	WATFE	742	" Clever sensitive children , subjected precociously to emulation and emotion , are always liable to such maladies . My third girl , Anna Maria , fell , into a low fever , caused by nervous excitement in trying for school prizes . "
106617	106626	106627	106629	MR . HARTOPP	682	" Did she die of it , sir ? "
106633	106694	106695	106695	WAIFE	442	" Die ! no ! I removed her from school , set her to take care of the poultry , forbade all French exercises , made her take English exercises instead , and ride on a donkey . She 's quite another thing now , cheeks as red as an apple , and as firm as a cricket - ball . "
106698	106730	106731	106733	MR . HARTOPP	682	" I will keep poultry ; I will buy a donkey . Oh , sir ! you do n't think she will go to heaven yet , and leave me here ? "
106736	106753	106754	106754	WAIFE	442	" Not if you give her rest and quiet . But no excitement , no exhibitions . "
106763	106853	106854	106854	HARTOPP	682	" Will you kindly count that money , sir ? Do n't you think that would be enough to find her some pretty lodgings hereabouts till she gets quite strong again ? With green fields , - she 's fond of green fields and a farm - yard with poultry , - though we were lodging a few days ago with a good woman who kept hens , and Sophy did not seem to take to them much . A canary bird is more of a companion , and - "
106858	106871	106872	106872	WAIFE	442	" Ay - ay - and you ! what would you do ? "
106875	106893	106894	106894	HARTOPP	682	" Why , I and the dog would go away for a little while about the country . "
106897	106900	106901	106901	WAIFE	442	" Exhibiting ? "
106904	106931	106932	106932	HARTOPP	682	" That money will not last forever , and what can we do , I and the dog , in order to get more for her ? "
106939	106996	106997	106997	WAIFE	442	" You are a good man , sir . I am sure of it ; you can not have done things which you should be afraid to tell me . Make me your confidant , and I may then find some employment fit for you , and you need not separate yourself from your little girl . "
107000	107047	107048	107048	HARTOPP	682	" Separate from her ! I should only leave her for a few days at a time till she gets well . This money would keep her , - how long ? Two months ? three ? how long ? the doctor would not charge much . "
107051	107081	107082	107082	WAIFE	442	" YOU will not confide in me then ? At your age , - have you no friends , - no one to speak a good word for you ? "
107093	107133	107331	107335	a Latin love - poet	3927	" So - so ! Who talks to you about me , sir ? I am speaking of my innocent child . Does she want a good word spoken for her ? Heaven has written it in her face . "
107325	107329	107331	107335	a Latin love - poet	3927	" There is , "
107337	107345	107609	107611	MR . HARTOPP	682	" no why or wherefore in liking . "
107614	107661	107662	107662	WAIFE	442	" I can not presume to question you further , Mr. Chapman . But to one of your knowledge of the world , I need not say that your silence deprives me of the power to assist yourself . We 'll talk no more of that . "
107665	107674	107839	107839	Hartopp	682	" Thank you , gratefully , Mr. Mayor . "
107680	107837	107889	107889	Hartopp	682	" But for the little girl , make your mind easy , - at least for the present . I will place her at my farm cottage . My bailiff 's wife , a kind woman , will take care of her , while you pursue your calling elsewhere . As for this money , you will want it yourself ; your poor little child shall cost you nothing . So that 's settled . Let me come up and see her . I am a bit of a doctor myself . Every man blest with a large family , in whose house there is always some interesting case of small - pox , measles , whooping - cough , scarlatina , etc . , has a good private practice of his own . I 'm not brilliant in book - learning , Mr. Chapman . But as to children 's complaints in a practical way , "
107847	107887	107889	107889	Hartopp	682	" Mrs. H. says she 'd rather trust the little ones to me than to Dr. Gill . I 'll see your child , and set her up I 'll be bound . But now I think of it , "
107896	107922	108030	108033	CHAPTER XX . Sophy	744	" if exhibit you must , why not stay at Gatesboro ' for a time ? More may be made in this town than elsewhere . "
107923	107955	107889	107889	Hartopp	682	" No , no ; I could not have the heart to act here again without her . I feel at present as if I can never again act at all ! "
107956	107973	107987	107987	he	3944	" Something else will turn up . Providence is so kind to me , Mr. Mayor . "
107980	107986	107991	107992	The Mayor	12758	" You will come soon ? "
108006	108029	108374	108375	The Mayor	12758	" I will but stay to give some orders ; in a quarter of an hour I shall be at your hotel . "

108399	108410	108411	108411	she	442	" No , sir , not hurt it , but - "
108415	108458	108605	108605	her	442	" I have been talking to your grandpapa about you , my dear , and we both wish to give you a little holiday . Dolls are well enough for the winter , but green fields and daisy chains for the summer . "
108623	108646	108655	108655	Waife	442	" And you , Grandy , - will you like it ? wo n't it be dull for you , Grandy dear ? "
108647	108653	108655	108655	Waife	442	" Why , my darling , "
108657	108678	108785	108785	She	3967	" I and Sir Isaac will go and take a stroll about the country for a few weeks , and - "
108683	108784	108815	108816	the Mayor	12758	" I thought so ; I thought he meant that . I tried not to believe it ; go away , - you ? and who 's to take care of you ? who 'll understand you ? I want care ! I ! I ! No , no , it is you , - you who want care . I shall be well to - morrow , - quite well , do n't fear . He shall not be sent away from me ; he shall not , sir . Oh , Grandfather , Grandfather , how could you ? "
108810	108813	108881	108881	he	12758	" But , "
108818	108880	108881	108881	he	12758	" it is not as if you were going to school , my dear ; you are going for a holiday . And your grandfather must leave you , - must travel about ; ' tis his calling . If you fell ill and were with him , think how much you would be in his way . Do you know , "
108886	108897	108903	108903	Waife	442	" I shall begin to fear that you are selfish . "

The pretty cottage , and all for me ; and what for him ? - tramp , tramp along the hot dusty roads . Do you see that he is lame ? Oh , Sir , I know him ; you do n't . Selfish ! he would have no merry ways that make you laugh without me ; would you , Grandy dear ? Go away , you are a naughty man , - go , or I shall hate you as much as that dreadful Mr. Rugge . "

110267	110271	110255	110258	the Mayor of Gatesboro	12794	" Gentleman Waife , "
110278	110289	110305	110305	she	442	" Dii meliora ! What will he do with it ? "
110342	110360	110372	110373	the Mayor	12758	" I 'll not hate you . I was ungrateful and peevish ; may I beg pardon ? "
110361	110370	110372	110373	the Mayor	12758	" I forgive you with all my heart , "
110380	110397	110415	110415	Waife	442	" And now try and compose yourself and sleep while I talk with your grandpapa below . "
110398	110413	110415	110415	Waife	442	" I do n't see how it is possible that I can leave her , "
110429	110434	110436	110437	the Mayor	12758	" I am sure , "
110441	110613	110820	110821	The Mayor	12758	" that it is the best thing for her : her pulse has much nervous excitability ; she wants a complete rest ; she ought not to move about with you on any account . But come : though I must not know , it seems , who and what you are , Mr. Chapman , I do n't think you will run off with my cow ; and if you like to stay at the bailiff 's cottage for a week or two with your grandchild , you shall be left in peace , and asked no questions . I will own to you a weakness of mine : I value myself on being seldom or never taken in . I do n't think I could forgive the man who did take me in . But taken in I certainly shall be , if , despite all your mystery , you are not as honest a fellow as ever stood upon shoe - leather ! So come to the cottage . "
110672	110819	110828	110828	Waife	442	" No , sir ; thank you most humbly . No , sir ; that must not be . I must work for my daily bread ; if what a poor vagabond like me may do can be called work . I have made it a rule for years not to force myself to the hearth and home of any kind man , who , not knowing my past , has a right to suspect me . Where I lodge , I pay as a lodger ; or whatever favour shown me spares my purse , I try to return in some useful humble way . Why , sir , how could I make free and easy with another man 's board and roof - tree for days or weeks together , when I would not even come to your hearthstone for a cup of tea ? "
110832	111037	111127	111128	Mr. Hartopp	682	" But for my poor child I have no such scruples , - no shame , no false pride . I take what you offer her gratefully , - gratefully . Ah , sir , she is not in her right place with me ; but there 's no use kicking against the pricks . Where was I ? Oh ! well , I tell you what we will do , sir . I will take her to the cottage in a day or two , - as soon as she is well enough to go , - and spend the day with her , and deceive her , sir ! yes , deceive , cheat her , sir ! I am a cheat , a player , and she 'll think I 'm going to stay with her ; and at night , when she 's asleep , I 'll creep off , I and the other dog . But I 'll leave a letter for her : it will soothe her , and she 'll be patient and wait . I will come back again to see her in a week , and once every week , till she 's well again . "
111038	111045	111056	111057	the actor	1644	" And what will you do ? "
111046	111054	111056	111057	the actor	1644	" I do n't know ; but , "
111063	111081	111127	111128	Mr. Hartopp	682	" I ' m not a man likely to starve . Oh , never fear , sir . "
111108	111125	111314	111315	the Mayor	12758	" It is all very well that the poor man should be away for some days , "
111130	111312	111314	111315	the Mayor	12758	" Before he comes again , I shall have hit on some plan to serve him ; and I can learn more about him from the child in his absence , and see what he is really fit for . There 's a schoolmaster wanted in Morley 's village . Old Morley wrote to me to recommend him one . Good salary , - pretty house . But it would be wrong to set over young children - recommend to a respectable proprietor and his parson - a man whom I know nothing about . Impossible ! that will not do . If there was any place of light service which did not require trust or responsibility , - but there is no such place in Great Britain . Suppose I were to set him up in some easy way of business , - a little shop , eh ? I do n't know . What would Williams say ? If , indeed , I were taken in ! if the man I am thus credulously trusting turned out a rogue , "
111325	111433	112172	112172	Hartopp	697	" why then , I should be fallen indeed . My wife would not let me have half - a - crown in my pockets ; and I could , not walk a hundred yards but Williams would be at my heels to protect me from being stolen by gypsies . Taken in by him ! No , impossible ! But if it turn out as I suspect , - that , contrary to vulgar prudence , I am divining a really great and good man in difficulties , aha , what a triumph I shall then gain over them all ! How Williams will revere me ! "
112158	112170	112172	112172	Hartopp	697	" So kind in you to come with me , Mary , "
112174	112206	112271	112272	Mrs. Hartopp	697	" I could not have been happy without your approval : look at the child ; something about her like Mary Anne , and Mary Anne is the picture of you ! "
112296	112302	112271	112272	Mrs. Hartopp	697	" I see the likeness ! "
112307	112335	112470	112477	One of the two children owning that name	4084	" I fear you are tired , my dear : you must not overfatigue yourself ; and you must take milk fresh from the cow every morning . "
112457	112469	112470	112477	One of the two children owning that name	4084	" Very like Mary Anne ! - Mary Anne , dear . "
112494	112547	112554	112555	the Mayor	12758	" This little girl , my Mary Anne , was as pale as you , - over - study ; and now , my dear child , you must try and steal a little of her colour . Do n't you think my Mary Anne is like her papa , Mr. Chapman ? "
112548	112552	112554	112555	the Mayor	12758	" Like me ! "
112560	112571	112573	112575	the artful actor	4087	" image of her mother ! the same intellectual look ! "
112577	112628	112838	112838	Waife	442	" Indeed , ma'am , the young lady has her father 's mouth and eyebrows , but that acute , sensible expression is yours , - quite yours . Sir Isaac , make a bow to the young lady , and then , sir , go through the sword exercise ! "
112823	112836	112838	112838	Waife	442	" Let us steal out into the back garden , my darling , "
112840	112867	113015	113015	she	442	" I see an arbour there , where I will compose myself with a pipe , - a liberty I should not like to take indoors . "
113019	113037	113052	113052	Waife	442	" We could be so happy here , Grandfather ! It can not last , can it ? "
113038	113050	113052	113052	Waife	442	" It is no use in this life , my dear , "
113056	113141	113015	113015	she	442	" no use at all disturbing present happiness by asking , ' Can it last ? ' To - day is man 's , to - morrow his Maker 's . But tell me frankly , do you really dislike so much the idea of exhibiting ? I do n't mean as we did in Mr. Rugge 's show . I know you hate that ; but in a genteel private way , as the other night . You sigh ! Out with it . "
113142	113151	113052	113052	Waife	442	" I like what you like , Grandy . "
113152	113195	113015	113015	she	442	" That 's not true . I like to smoke ; you do n't . Come , you do dislike acting ? Why ? you do it so well , - wonderfully . Generally speaking , people like what they do well . "
113196	113236	113052	113052	Waife	442	" It is not the acting itself , Grandy dear , that I do n't like . When I am in some part , I am carried away ; I am not myself . I am some one else ! "
113237	113242	113015	113015	she	442	" And the applause ? "
113243	113436	113449	113449	Waife	442	" I do n't feel it . I dare say I should miss it if it did not come ; but it does not seem to me as if I were applauded . If I felt that , I should stop short , and get frightened . It is as if that somebody else into whom I was changed was making friends with the audience ; and all my feeling is for that somebody , - just as , Grandy dear , when it is over , and we two are alone together , all my feeling is for you , - at least hanging her head it used to be ; but lately , somehow , I am ashamed to think how I have been feeling for myself more than for you . Is it - is it that I am growing selfish ? as Mr. Mayor said . Oh , no ! Now we are here , - not in those noisy towns , - not in the inns and on the highways ; now here , here , I do feel again for you , - all for you ! "
113437	113447	113505	113505	he	4108	" You are my little angel , you are , "
113453	113504	113505	113505	he	4108	" Selfish ! you ! a good joke that ! Now you see , I am not what is called Demonstrative , - a long word , Sophy , which means , that I do n't show to you always how fond I am of you ; and , indeed , "
113509	113717	113747	113747	she	4109	" I am not al ways aware of it myself . I like acting , - I like the applause , and the lights , and the excitement , and the illusion , - the make - belief of the whole thing : it takes me out of memory and thought ; it is a world that has neither past , present , nor future , an interlude in time,-an escape from space . I suppose it is the same with poets when they are making verses . Yes , I like all this ; and , when I think of it , I forget you too much . And I never observed , Heaven forgive me ! that you were pale and drooping till it was pointed out to me . Well , take away your arms . Let us consult ! As soon as you get quite , quite well , how shall we live ? what shall we do ? You are as wise as a little woman , and such a careful , prudent housekeeper ; and I 'm such a harumscarum old fellow , without a sound idea in my head . What shall we do if we give up acting altogether ? "
113718	113746	113747	113747	she	4109	" Give up acting altogether , when you like it so ! No , no . I will like it too , Grandy . But - but - "
113760	113785	113792	113792	Sophy	442	" But what ? let us make clean breasts , one to the other ; tell truth , and shame the Father of Lies . "
113786	113790	113792	113792	Sophy	442	" Tell truth , "
113822	113977	114015	114015	he	4111	" Could we but manage to tell truth off the stage , I should not dislike acting ! Oh , Grandfather , when that kind gentleman and his lady and those merry children come up and speak to us , do n't you feel ready to creep into the earth ? - I do . Are we telling truth ? are we living truth ? one name to - day , another name to morrow ? I should not mind acting on a stage or in a room , for the time , but always acting , always , - we ourselves ' make beliefs ! ' Grandfather , must that be ? They do n't do it ; I mean by they , all who are good and looked up to and respected , as - as - oh , Grandy ! Grandy ! what am I saying ? I have pained you . "
114007	114014	114015	114015	he	4111	" We must , hide ourselves , "
114023	114101	114146	114146	he	4111	" we must take false names ; I - because - because of reasons I ca n't tell even to you ; and you , because I failed to get you a proper home , where you ought to be ; and there is one who , if he pleases , and he may please it any day , could take you away from me , if he found you out ; and so - and so - "
114138	114144	114146	114146	he	4111	" But as for me , "
114148	114255	114321	114321	he	4111	" if I have lost all name ; if , while I live , I must be this wandering , skulking outcast , - look above , Sophy , - look up above : there all secrets will be known , all hearts read ; and there my best hope to find a place in which I may wait your coming is in what has lost me all birthright here . Not to exalt myself do I say this , - no ; but that you may have comfort , darling , if ever hereafter you are pained by what men say to you of me . "
114335	114373	114384	114384	Sophy	442	" But to the point in question , suppose we have done with acting and roaming , and keep to one name and settle somewhere like plain folks , again I ask , How shall we live ? "
114374	114382	114384	114384	Sophy	442	" I have been thinking of that , "
114386	114499	114515	114515	he	4117	" You remember that those good Miss Burtons taught me all kinds of needlework , and I know people can make money by needlework . And then , Grandy dear , what ca n't you do ? Do you forget Mrs. Saunders 's books that you bound , and her cups and saucers that you mended ? So we would both work , and have a little cottage and a garden , that we could take care of , and sell the herbs and vegetables . Oh , I have thought over it all , the last fortnight , a hundred hundred times , only I did not dare to speak first . "
114505	114513	114515	114515	he	4117	" I can make very good baskets , "
114521	114631	114641	114641	Sophy	442	" famous baskets if one could hire a bit of osier ground , and , as you say , there might be other fancy articles I could turn out prettily enough , and you could work samplers , and urn - rugs , and doileys , and pincushions , and so forth ; and what with a rood or two of garden ground , and poultry the Mayor says poultry is healthy for children , upon my word , if we could find a safe place , and people would not trouble us with their gossip , and we could save a little money for you when I am - "
114632	114639	114515	114515	he	4117	" Bees too , - honey ? "
114651	114701	114515	114515	he	4117	" Yes , bees , - certainly . A cottage of that kind in a village would not be above L6 a year , and L20 spent on materials for fancy - works would set us up . Ah but furniture , beds and tables , - monstrous dear ! "
114702	114714	114727	114727	Waife	442	" Oh , no ! very little would do at first . "
114715	114725	115342	115342	Sophy	442	" Let us count the money we have left , "
114808	114811	114831	114831	Waife	442	" Robinson Crusoe "
114816	114829	114831	114831	Waife	442	" I remember , I remember , just the place for us , "
114835	115106	115120	115120	Sophy	442	" It is many , many , many years since I was there ; I was courting my Lizzy at the time , - alas ! alas . But no sad thoughts now ! - just the place , near a large town , but in a pretty village quite retired from it . ' T was there I learned to make baskets . I had broken my leg ; fall from a horse ; nothing to do . I lodged with an old basketmaker ; he had a capital trade . Rivulet at the back of his house ; reeds , osiers , plentiful . I see them now , as I saw them from my little casement while my leg was setting . And Lizzy used to write to me such dear letters ; my baskets were all for her . We had baskets enough to have furnished a house with bask'ts ; could have dined in baskets , sat in baskets , slept in baskets . With a few lessons I could soon recover the knack of the work . I should like to see the place again ; it would be shaking hands with my youth once more . None who could possibly recognize me could be now living . Saw no one but the surgeon , the basketmaker , and his wife ; all so old they must be long since gathered to their fathers . Perhaps no one carries on the basket trade now . I may revive it and have it all to myself ; perhaps the cottage itself may be easily hired . "
115131	115267	115284	115287	the bailiff 's wife	4074	" And a fine large park close by : the owners , great lords , deserted it then ; perhaps it is deserted still . You might wander over it as if it were your own , Sophy . Such wonderful trees , - such green solitudes ; and pretty shy hares running across the vistas , - stately deer too ! We will make friends with the lodge - keepers , and we will call the park yours , Sophy ; and I shall be a genius who weaves magical baskets , and you shall be the enchanted princess concealed from all evil eyes , knitting doileys of pearl under leaves of emerald , and catching no sound from the world of perishable life , except as the boughs whisper and the birds sing . "
115268	115282	115284	115287	the bailiff 's wife	4074	" Dear me , here you are ; we thought you were lost , "
115289	115336	115438	115439	Mr. Gooch	756	" tea is waiting for you , and there 's husband , sir , coming up from his work ; he 'll be proud and glad to know you , sir , and you too , my dear ; we have no children of our own . "
115427	115436	115438	115439	Mr. Gooch	756	" We 'll take all care of her , "
115441	115453	115454	115454	Waife	442	" You 'll not know her again when you come back . "
115469	115599	116016	116016	Sophy	442	" You are sure you will find your way , - no , that 's the wrong turn , - straight onto the town . They 'll be sitting up for you at the Saracen 's Head , I suppose , of course , sir ? It seems not hospitable like , your going away at the dead of night thus . But I understand you do n't like crying , sir , we men do n't ; and your sweet little girl I dare say would sob ready to break her heart if she knew . Fine moonlight night , sir , - straight on . And I say , do n't fret about her : wife loves children dearly , - so do I. Good - night . "
115801	115920	116016	116016	Sophy	442	" I trust , dear and honoured sir , that I shall come back safely ; and when I do , I may have found perhaps a home for her , and some way of life such as you would not blame . But , in case of accident , I have left with Mr. Gooch , sealed up , the money we made at Gatesboro ' , after paying the inn bill , doctor , etc . , and retaining the mere trifle I need in case I and Sir Isaac fail to support ourselves . You will kindly take care of it . I should not feel safe with more money about me , an old man .
115921	116012	116016	116016	Sophy	442	" I might be robbed ; besides , I am careless . I never can keep money ; it slips out of my hands like an eel . Heaven bless you , sir ; your kindness seems like a miracle vouchsafed to me for that child 's dear sake . No evil can chance to her with you ; and if I should fall ill and die , even then you , who would have aided the tricksome vagrant , will not grudge the saving hand to the harmless child . "
116021	116283	116731	116731	she	442	" Darling , forgive me ; I have stolen away from you , but only for a few days , and only in order to see if we can not gain the magic home where I am to be the Genius , and you the Princess . I go forth with such a light heart , Sophy dear , I shall be walking thirty miles a day , and not feel an ache in the lame leg : you could not keep up with me ; you know you could not . So think over the cottage and the basket - work , and practise at samplers and pincushions , when it is too hot to play ; and be stout and strong against I come back . That , I trust , will be this day week , - -'t is but seven days ; and then we will only act fairy dramas to nodding trees , with linnets for the orchestra ; and even Sir Isaac shall not be demeaned by mercenary tricks , but shall employ his arithmetical talents in casting up the weekly bills , and he shall never stand on his hind legs except on sunny days , when he shall carry a parasol to shade an enchanted princess . Laugh ; darling , - let me fancy I see you laughing ; but do n't fret , - do n't fancy I desert you . Do try and get well , - quite , quite well ; I ask it of you on my knees . "
116761	116783	116794	116794	Sophy	442	" I am so glad to see you do n't pine after your good grandpapa , as we feared you would . "
116784	116792	117304	117305	Mrs. Crane	482	" He told me not to pine , "
117264	117302	117921	117922	Mr. Hartopp	682	" Yes , Mr. Mayor ; all right ! it is our little girl , - our dear Sophy . This way , Mr. Losely . Such a pleasant surprise for you , Sophy , my love ! "
117889	117920	118014	118014	he	682	" The Mayor , God bless him ! has been taken in : this must not occur again , or Gatesboro ' is dishonoured , and Virtue indeed a name ! "
118020	118024	118216	118216	his	12758	" Fitting retribution , "
118179	118202	118263	118264	the Mayor	12758	" What have you done with the charge I intrusted to you ? My child ! my child ! where is she ? "
118253	118261	118263	118264	the Mayor	12758	" Mr. - Mr. Chapman , sir , "
118276	118285	118291	118292	Mr. Williams	692	" I am astonished at your - your - "
118286	118289	118263	118264	the Mayor	12758	" Audacity ! "
118294	118309	118315	118316	the Mayor	12758	" My child ! my Sophy ! my child ! answer me , man ! "
118310	118313	118319	118319	himself	12758	" Sir , "
118322	118343	118353	118353	Waife	442	" have you not got the note which I left at my bailiff 's cottage in case you called there ? "
118344	118351	118353	118353	Waife	442	" Your note ! this thing ! "
118371	118400	118411	118412	the Mayor	12758	" You have rendered up , you say , the child to her lawful protector ? Gracious heavens ! did I trust her to you , or not ? "
118401	118409	118443	118443	Williams	692	" Leave the room all of you , "
118424	118441	118443	118443	Williams	692	" You go , - you , sirs ; what the deuce do you do here ? "
118449	118467	118569	118570	the Mayor	12758	" Out ! I stay , never fear , men , I 'll take care of him ! "
118559	118567	118569	118570	the Mayor	12758	" My good Williams , leave us , "
118572	118581	118627	118628	The Mayor	12758	" I would be alone with this person . "
118582	118626	118627	118628	The Mayor	12758	" Alone , - you ! out of the question . Now you have been once taken in , and you own it , - it is my duty to protect you henceforth ; and I will to the end of my days . "
118632	118664	118627	118628	The Mayor	12758	" Well , Williams , well ! - take a chair , and be quiet . Now , Mr. Chapman , so to call you still ; you have deceived me . "

Lean on me , Mr. Waite , and call off that big animal . He 's a suspicating my calves and circumtittyvating them . Thank ye , sir . You see I was born with sinister aspects in my Twelfth House , which appertains to big animals and enemies ; and dogs of that size about one 's calves are - malefics ! "

You took one turn ; I took another : but you see we meet at last , as good men always do in this world or the other , which is the same thing in the long run . "

No : I have won to - day , it is true , but I may lose to - morrow ; and besides I am in want of so many things : when one gets a little money , one has an immediate necessity for more - ha ! ha ! Still I would not have the child die ; and she may grow up to be of use . I tell you what I will do ; if , when the races are over , I find I have gained enough to afford it , I will see about buying her off . But L100 is too much ! Rugge ought to take half the money , or a quarter , because , if she do n't act , I suppose she does eat . "

Fulfil your solemn promises : marry me . I will forget whose daughter that girl is ; I will be a mother to her . And for yourself , give me the right to feel for you again as I once did , and I may find a way to raise you yet , - higher than you can raise yourself . I have some wit , Jasper , as you know . At the worst you shall have the pastime , I the toil . In your illness I will nurse you : in your joys I will intrude no share .

No : put that idea out of your head ; we know each other too well for conjugal felicity . You love me now : you always did , and always will ; that is , while we are not tied to each other . Women who once love me , always love me ; ca n't help themselves . I am sure I do n't know why , except that I am what they call a villain ! Ha ! the clock striking seven : I dine with a set of fellows I have picked up on the race - ground ; they do n't know me , nor I them ; we shall be better acquainted after the third bottle . Cheer up , Crane : go and scold Sophy , and make her act if you can ; if not , scold Rugge into letting her alone . Scold somebody ; nothing like it , to keep other folks quiet , and one 's self busy . Adieu ! and pray , no more matrimonial solicitations : they frighten me ! Gad , "

130834	130874	130875	130875	POOLE	790	" Yes , Poole , my hearty , as you say , that fellow trumping my best club lost me the last rubber . There 's no certainty in whist , if one has a spoon for a partner . "
130878	130933	130934	130934	JASPER	721	" No certainty in every rubber , but next to certainty in the long run , when a man plays as well as you do , Mr. Losely . Your winnings to - night must have been pretty large , though you had a bad partner almost every hand ; pretty large , eh ? "
130938	130949	130950	130950	POOLE	790	" Nothing to talk of , - a few ponies ! "
130953	130963	130964	130964	JASPER	721	" More than a few ; I should know . "
130967	130979	130980	130980	POOLE	790	" Why ? You did not play after the first rubber . "
130983	131026	131027	131029	The shrewd Dolly	792	" No , when I saw your play on that first rubber , I cut out , and bet on you ; and very grateful to you I am . Still you would win more with a partner who understood your game . "
131049	131059	131091	131091	he	790	" I do ; it is a French one . "
131096	131118	131129	131129	Poole	790	" French , ay ! In France there is more dash in playing out trumps than there is with English players . "
131119	131127	131129	131129	Poole	790	" And with a player like you , "
131137	131144	131171	131171	Poole	790	" more trumps to play out . "
131182	131198	131091	131091	he	790	" I did not mean to offend you , Mr. Losely , but to caution . "
131199	131202	131171	131171	Poole	790	" Caution ! "
131203	131307	131308	131308	Jasper	721	" There were two knowing coves , who , if they had not been so drunk , would not have lost their money without a row , and they would have seen how they lost it ; they are sharpers : you served them right ; do n't be angry with me . You want a partner ; so do I : you play better than I do , but I play well ; you shall have two - thirds of our winnings , and when you come to town I 'll introduce you to a pleasant set of young fellows - green . "
131313	131352	131371	131372	the manager	1477	" You know a thing or two , I see , Master Poole , and we 'll discuss the whole subject after breakfast . Ar'n't you hungry ? No ! I am ! Hillo ! who 's that ? "

131394	131401	131414	131414	He	4684	" Go on and order breakfast , "

131468	131582	131414	131414	He	4684	" ' Then she did not go without help : somebody must have thrown up to her a rope - ladder ; nothing so easy ; done it myself scores of times for the descent of ' maids who love the moon , ' Mr. Rugge . But at her age there is not a moon ; at least there is not a man in the moon : one must dismiss , then , the idea of a rope - ladder , - too precocious . But are you quite sure she is gone ? not hiding in some cupboard ? Sacre ! very odd . Have you seen Mrs. Crane about it ? "
131583	131616	131414	131414	He	4684	" Yes , just come from her ; she thinks that villain Waife must have stolen her . But I want you , sir , to come with me to a magistrate . "
131617	131632	131414	131414	He	4684	" Magistrate ! I ! why ? nonsense ; set the police to work . "
131633	131659	131414	131414	He	4684	" Your deposition that she is your lawful child , lawfully made over to me , is necessary for the inquisition ; I mean police . "
131660	131708	131414	131414	He	4684	" Hang it , what a bother ! I hate magistrates , and all belonging to them . Well , I must breakfast ! I 'll see to it afterwards . Oblige me by not calling Mr. Waife a villain ; good old fellow in his way . "

131716	131737	131414	131414	He	4684	" But if he took her off , how did he get at her ? It must have been preconcerted . "
131738	131763	131414	131414	He	4684	" Ha ! true . But she has not been suffered to speak to a soul not in the company , Mrs. Crane excepted . "
131764	131776	131414	131414	He	4684	" Perhaps at the performance last night some signal was given ? "
131777	131806	131414	131414	He	4684	" But if Waife had been there I should have seen him ; my troupe would have known him : such a remarkable face ; one eye too . "

My uncle Sam is more anxious about my sins than the other codgers , because he is my godfather , and responsible for my sins , I suppose ; and he says he will put me in the way of being respectable .

But there were only two whom I could have safely allowed to run away with me ; and they were so closely watched , poor things , that I was forced to leave them to their fate , - early graves ! Do n't talk to me of heiresses , Dolly ; I have been the victim of heiresses . But a rich widow is an estimable creature . Against widows , if rich , I have not a word to say ; and to tell you the truth , there is a widow whom I suspect I have fascinated , and whose connection I have a particular private reason for deeming desirable ! She has a whelp of a son , who is a spoke in my wheel : were I his father - in - law , would not I be a spoke in his ? I 'd teach the boy ' life , ' Dolly . "

137092	137109	137058	137059	the gentleman	11276	" The Captain was not in the Hussars , sir ; he was in the Guards . "
137110	137307	137058	137059	the gentleman	11276	" Of course he was ; but I was saying - in the Hussars , together with the Guards , there were some very fine fellows ; very fine ; he was one of them . I could not resist paying my respects to the widowed lady of so fine a fellow . I know it is a liberty , ma'am , but ' t is my way . People who know me well - and I have a large acquaintance - are kind enough to excuse my way . And to think that villanous horse , which I had just bought out of Lord Bolton 's stud 200 guineas , ma'am , and cheap , should have nearly taken the life of Charles Haughton 's lovely relict ! If anybody else had been driving that brute , I shudder to think what might have been the consequences ; but I have a wrist of iron . Strength is a vulgar qualification , - very vulgar ; but when it saves a lady from perishing , how can one be ashamed of it ? But I am detaining you . Your own house , Mrs. Haughton ? "
137308	137333	137058	137059	the gentleman	11276	" Yes , sir , I have just taken it , but the workmen have not finished . I am not yet settled here . "

137353	137365	137058	137059	the gentleman	11276	" No , sir , but he wishes it very much . "
137366	137378	137058	137059	the gentleman	11276	" Mr. Darrell , I think , could gratify that wish . "
137379	137401	137422	137423	Mrs. Haughton	515	" What ! you know Mr. Darrell , that most excellent generous man . All we have we owe to him . "
137425	137478	137526	137527	Mrs. Haughton	515	" Yes , I knew him once . He has had many a fee out of my family . Goodish lawyer ; cleverish man ; and rich as a Jew . I should like to see my old friend 's son , ma'am . He must be monstrous handsome with such parents ! "
137479	137499	137422	137423	Mrs. Haughton	515	" Oh , sir , very like his father . I shall be proud to present him to you . "

Young men should see Life ! "
138691	138788	139111	139112	Mrs. Haughton	515	" But in an innocent way , ma'am , such as mothers would approve . We 'll fix an evening for it when I have the honour to call again . Good morning , Mrs. Haughton . Your hand again , sir to Lionel . Ah , we shall be great friends , I guess ! You must let me take you out in my cab ; teach you to handle the ribbons , eh ? ' Gad , my old friend Charles was a whip . Ha ! Ha ! Goodday , good - day ! "
138871	138887	138897	138898	Mrs. Haughton	515	" My old friend 's particular friend is - not bad looking , Mrs. Haughton ! "

139014	139110	139136	139140	the man of the world	4961	" We must be careful that they do not pick up worse than words when they leave school , my dear madam . You will forgive me , but Mr. Darrell has so expressly - of course , with your permission - commended this young gentleman to my responsible care and guidance ; so openly confided to me his views and intentions , - that perhaps you would do me the very great favour not to force upon him , against his own wishes , the acquaintance of - that very good - looking person . "
139129	139134	139136	139140	the man of the world	4961	" By the by , "
139142	139156	138897	138898	Mrs. Haughton	515	" may I inquire the name of my old friend 's particular friend ? "
139157	139183	139136	139140	the man of the world	4961	" His name ? upon my word I really do n't know it . Perhaps he left his card ; ring the bell , Lionel . "
139184	139234	138897	138898	Mrs. Haughton	515	" You do n't know his name , yet you know him , ma'am , and would allow your son to see LIFE under his auspices ! I beg you ten thousand pardons ; but even ladies the most cautious , mothers the most watchful , are exposed to - "

For unless his appearance greatly belies his years he must have been little more than a boy when Charles Haughton left Lionel fatherless . "

Better throw a youth at once into the wider sphere of a capital - provided you there secure to his social life the ordinary checks of good company , the restraints imposed by the presence of decorous women , and men of grave years and dignified repute - than confine him to the exclusive society of youths of his own age , the age of wild spirits and unreflecting imitation , unless he cling to the safeguard which is found in hard reading , less by the book - knowledge it bestows than by the serious and preoccupied mind which it abstracts from the coarser temptations .

Pity ! for that youngster has in him the right metal , - spirit and talent that should make him a first - rate soldier . It would be time well spent that should join professional studies with that degree of polite culture which gives dignity and cures dulness . I must get him out of London , out of England ; cut him off from his mother 's apron - strings , and the particular friends of his poor father who prowl unannounced into the widow 's drawing - room . He shall go to Paris ; no better place to learn military theories , and be civilized out of huffy dispositions . No doubt my old friend , the chevalier , who has the art strategic at his fingerends , might be induced to take him en pension , direct his studies , and keep him out of harm 's way . I can secure to him the entree into the circles of the rigid old Faubourg St. Germain , where manners are best bred , and household ties most respected . Besides , as I am so often at Paris myself , I shall have him under my eye , and a few years there , spent in completing him as man , may bring him nearer to that marshal 's baton which every recruit should have in his eye , than if I started him at once a raw boy , unable to take care of himself as an ensign , and unfitted , save by mechanical routine , to take care of others , should he live to buy the grade of a colonel .

146645	146708	146627	146627	He	5189	" Fancy ! that purse - proud Grand Turk of an infidel , though he would not believe me , has been to France , - yes , actually to - - - making inquiries evidently with reference to Sophy . The woman who ought to have thoroughly converted him took flight , however , and missed seeing him . Confound her ! "
146709	146928	146967	146967	she	482	" I ought to have been there . So I have no doubt for the present the Pagan remains stubborn . Gone on into Italy I hear ; doing me , violating the laws of Nature , and roving about the world , with his own solitary hands in his bottomless pockets , - like the wandering Jew ! But , as some slight set - off in my run of ill - luck , I find at the post - office a pleasanter letter than the one which brings me this news . A rich elderly lady , who has no family , wants to adopt a nice child ; will take Sophy , - make it worth my while to let her have Sophy . ' T is convenient in a thousand ways to settle one 's child comfortably in a rich house ; establishes rights , subject , of course , to cheques which would not affront me , - a father ! But the first thing requisite is to catch Sophy : ' t is in that I ask your help ; you are so clever . Best of creatures ! what could I do without you ? As you say , whenever I want a friend I come to you , - Bella ! "
146957	146965	146929	146930	Mrs. Crane	482	" You know where the child is , "
146971	146997	146929	146930	Mrs. Crane	482	" Well , I take it for granted she is with the old man ; and I have seen him , - seen him yesterday . "
146998	147009	146929	146930	Mrs. Crane	482	" Go on ; you saw him , - where ? "
147010	147015	146929	146930	Mrs. Crane	482	" Near London Bridge . "
147016	147043	147199	147199	Jasper	721	" What business could you possibly have in that direction ? Ah ! I guess , the railway station to Dover : you are going abroad ? "
147044	147198	147199	147199	Jasper	721	" No such thing ; you are so horribly suspicious . But it is true I had been to the station inquiring after some luggage or parcels which a friend of mine had ordered to be left there ; now , do n't interrupt me . At the foot of the bridge I caught a sudden glimpse of the old man , - changed , altered , aged , one eye lost . You had said I should not know him again , but I did ; I should never have recognized his face . I knew him by the build of the shoulder , a certain turn of the arms , I do n't know what ; one knows a man familiar to one from birth without seeing his face . Oh , Bella ; I declare that I felt as soft , - as soft as the silliest muff who ever - "
147221	147269	146929	146930	Mrs. Crane	482	" He was selling something in a basket , - matches , boot - straps , deuce knows what . He ! a clever man too ! I should have liked to drop into that d - - d basket all the money I had about me . "
147270	147276	147199	147199	Jasper	721	" Why did not you ? "
147277	147382	146929	146930	Mrs. Crane	482	" Why ? How could I ? He would have recognized me . There would have been a scene , - a row , a flare up , a mob round us , I dare say . I had no idea it would so upset me ; to see him selling matches too ; glad we did not meet at Gatesboro ' . Not even for that L100 do I think I could have faced him . No ; as he said when we last parted , ' The world is wide enough for both . ' Give me some brandy ; thank you . "
147383	147422	147199	147199	Jasper	721	" You did not speak to the old man ; he did not see you : but you wanted to get back the child ; you felt sure she must be with him ; you followed him home ? "
147423	147523	146929	146930	Mrs. Crane	482	" I ? No ; I should have had to wait for hours . A man like me , loitering about London Bridge ! I should have been too conspicuous ; he would have soon caught sight of me , though I kept on his blind side . I employed a ragged boy to watch and follow him , and here is the address . Now , will you get Sophy back for me without any trouble to me , without my appearing ? I would rather charge a regiment of horse - guards than bully that old man . "
147524	147539	147545	147545	Losely	721	" Yet you would rob him of the child , - his sole comfort ? "
147540	147543	147545	147545	Losely	721	" Bother ! "
147549	147646	148336	148336	Jasper	721	" the child can be only a burden to him ; well out of his way ; ' t is for the sake of that child he is selling matches ! It would be the greatest charity we could do him to set him free from that child sponging on him , dragging him down ; without her he 'd find a way to shift for himself . Why , he 's even cleverer than I am ! And there - there ; give him this money , but do n't say it came from me . "
147888	147897	147908	147908	he	5200	" You have suddenly grown rich , Jasper . "
147915	147962	148336	148336	Jasper	721	" Yes , rouge - et - noir , - luck . Now , do go and see after this affair , that 's a dear good woman . Get the child to - day if you can ; I will call here in the evening . "
147963	148009	147908	147908	he	5200	" Should you take her , then , abroad at once to this worthy lady who will adopt her ? If so , we shall meet , I suppose , no , more ; and I am assisting you to forget that I live still . "
148010	148056	148336	148336	Jasper	721	" Abroad , - that crotchet of yours again ! You are quite mistaken ; in fact , the lady is in London . It was for her effects that I went to the station . Oh , do n't be jealous ; quite elderly . "
148057	148097	147908	147908	he	5200	" Jealous , my dear Jasper ! you forget . I am as your mother . One of your letters , then , announced this lady 's intended arrival ; you were in correspondence with this - elderly lady . "
148098	148316	148336	148336	Jasper	721	" Why , not exactly in correspondence . But when I left Paris I gave the General Post Office as my address to a few friends in France . And this lady , who took an interest in my affairs ladies , whether old or young , who have once known me , always do , was aware that I had expectations with respect to the child . So some days ago , when I was so badly off , I wrote a line to tell her that Sophy had been no go , and that , but for a dear friend that is you , I might be on the pave . In her answer , she said she should be in London as soon as I received her letter ; and gave me an address here at which to learn where to find her when arrived , - a good old soul , but strange to London . I have been very busy , helping her to find a house , recommending tradesmen , and so forth . She likes style , and can afford it . A pleasant house enough , but our quiet evenings here spoil me for anything else . Now get on your bonnet , and let me see you off . "
148317	148335	148431	148431	she	5207	" On one condition , my dear Jasper , - that you stay here till I return . "
148434	148548	148688	148690	the jealous woman	5215	" In the side pocket of Mr. Losely 's coat there is a POCKET - BOOK ; in it there are some letters which I must see . I shall appear to go out ; leave the street - door ajar , that I may slip in again unobserved . You will serve dinner as soon as possible . And when Mr. Losely , as usual , exchanges his coat for the dressing - gown , contrive to take out that pocket - book unobserved by him . Bring it to me here , in this room : you can as easily replace it afterwards . A moment will suffice to my purpose . "

The service is reciprocal , if your brother - in - law will do me a favour . He takes with him his daughter , a mere child . Bridget , let them enter their names on the steam - vessel as William and Sophy Waife ; they can , of course , resume their own name when the voyage is over .

Well , then , we are both done up and cleaned out ; and my decided opinion is , that nothing is left but a bold stroke . "

My Paris friend , Madame Caumartin , was going to Italy , but her plans are changed , and she is now all for St. Petersburg . She will wait a few days for you to get well . We will all go together and enjoy ourselves . The Russians dote upon whist . We shall get into their swell sets and live like princes . "
150092	150137	150138	150138	Poole	790	" I tell you what we will do . Madame Caumartin lives in prime style . Get old Latham , your employer , to discount her bill at three months ' date for L500 , and we will be all off in a crack . "
150143	150162	150138	150138	Poole	790	" Old Latham is too knowing a file for that . A foreigner ! He 'd want security . "
150163	150169	150170	150170	Dolly	790	" I 'll be security . "
150185	150200	150170	150170	Dolly	790	" But you say he does discount paper , - gets rich on it ? "
150201	150226	150170	150170	Dolly	790	" Yes , gets rich on ' it , which he might not do if he discounted the paper you propose . No offence . "
150227	150245	150170	150170	Dolly	790	" Oh , no offence among friends ! You have taken him bills which he has discounted ? "
150246	150253	150170	150170	Dolly	790	" Yes , - good paper . "
150254	150276	150582	150584	the good man	3973	" Any paper signed by good names is good paper . We can sign good names if we know their handwritings . "
150595	150639	150766	150767	the landlady	2738	" But as soon as you are well , I 'll carry you with me to my country - box , and keep you out of harm 's way till I find you a wife , who will comb your head for you ; "
150720	150750	151357	151357	she	834	" ' T is as much as my nephew 's life is worth ; and , what is more to the purpose , as much as your bill is . "
151341	151345	151864	151865	Mr. Losely	721	" Sea Devil ; "
151881	152035	152041	152041	he	5295	" You see , ma'am , Samuel Dolly is a weak young man , and easily led astray ; but , luckily for himself , he has no money and no stomach . So he may repent in time ; and if I could find a wife to manage him , he has not a bad head for the main chance , and may become a practical man . Repeatedly I have told him he should go to prison , but that was only to frighten him ; fact is , I want to get him safe down into the country , and he do n't take to that . So I am forced to say , ' My box , home - brewed and South - down , Samuel Dolly , or a Lunnon jail and debtors ' allowance . ' Must give a young man his choice , my dear lady . "
152054	152156	152162	152163	Mrs. Crane	482	" And I thought I had him , till I found Mr. Losely in his sick - room ; but ever since that day , I do n't know how it is , the lad has had something on his mind , which I do n't half like , - cracky , I think , my dear lady , - cracky . I suspect that old nurse passes letters . I taxed her with it , and she immediately wanted to take her Bible - oath , and smelt of gin , two things which , taken together , look guilty . "
152157	152160	152162	152163	Mrs. Crane	482	" But , "
152169	152182	152415	152416	Uncle Sam	531	" if Mr. Losely and Mr. Poole do correspond , what then ? "
152183	152413	152415	152416	Uncle Sam	531	" That 's what I want to know , ma'am . Excuse me ; I do n't wish to disparage Mr. Losely , - a dashing gent , and nothing worse , I dare say . But certain sure I am that he has put into Samuel Dolly 's head something which has cracked it ! There is the lad now up and dressed , when he ought to be in bed , and swearing he 'll go to old Latham 's to - morrow , and that long arrears of work are on his conscience ! Never heard him talk of conscience before : that looks guilty ! And it does not frighten him any longer when I say he shall go to prison for his debts ; and he 's very anxious to get me out of Lunnon ; and when I threw in a word about Mr. Losely slyly , my good lady , - just to see its effect , he grew as white as that paper ; and then he began strutting and swelling , and saying that Mr. Losely would be a great man , and he should be a great man , and that he did not care for my money ; he could get as much money as he liked . That looks guilty , my dear lady . And oh , "
152422	152533	152547	152548	Mrs. Crane	482	" I do fear that he 's thinking of something worse than he has ever done before , and his brain ca n't stand it . And , ma'am , he has a great respect for you ; and you 've a friendship for Mr. Losely . Now , just suppose that Mr. Losely should have been thinking of what your flash sporting gents call a harmless spree , and my sister 's son should , being cracky , construe into something criminal . Oh , Mrs. Crane , do go and see Mr. Losely , and tell him that Samuel Dolly is not safe , - is not safe ! "
152534	152545	152547	152548	Mrs. Crane	482	" Much better that I should go to your nephew , "
152550	152575	152415	152416	Uncle Sam	531	" and with your leave I will do so at once . Let me see him alone . Where shall I find you afterwards ? "
152576	152620	152635	152635	HORAT	835	" At the Gloucester Coffee - house . Oh , my dear lady , how can I thank you enough ? The boy can be nothing to you ; but to me , he 's my sister 's son , - the blackguard ! "
152624	152633	152780	152780	she	730	" Dices laborantes in uno Penelopen vitreamque Circen . "
152771	152779	152780	152780	she	730	" You are going to the gallows , "
152784	152813	152928	152928	She	730	" Down on your knees , and tell me all , and I will keep your secret , and save you ; lie , and you are lost ! "
152875	152927	153324	153324	he	5318	" Take your nephew , out of town this evening , and do not let him from your sight for the next six months . Hark you , he will never be a good man ; but you may save him from the hulks . Do so . Take my advice . "
153319	153323	153324	153324	he	5318	" You here ! "
153327	153339	153303	153303	her	730	" you ! - at such an hour , - you ! "
153340	153413	153415	153415	Jasper	721	" Ay , Jasper Losely , here to warn you . To - morrow the officers of justice will be in that accursed house . To - morrow that woman - not for her worst crimes , they elude the law , but for her least by which the law hunts her down - will be a prisoner , - no , you shall not return to warn her as I warn you "
153428	153444	153453	153453	Jasper	721	" or , if you do , share her fate . I cast you off . "
153445	153451	153461	153461	she	5323	" What do you mean ? "
153466	153496	153415	153415	Jasper	721	" Speak more plainly : if poor Madame Caumartin has got into a scrape , which I do n't think likely , what have I to do with it ? "
153497	153535	153461	153461	she	5323	" The woman you call Caumartin fled from Paris to escape its tribunals . She has been tracked ; the French government have claimed her - ho ! - you smile . This does not touch you ? "
153536	153540	153415	153415	Jasper	721	" Certainly not . "
153541	153668	153798	153798	he	5325	" But there are charges against her from English tradesmen ; and if it be proved that you knew her in her proper name , - the infamous Gabrielle Desmarets ; if it be proved that you have passed off the French billets de banque that she stole ; if you were her accomplice in obtaining goods under her false name ; if you , enriched by her robberies , were aiding and abetting her as a swindler here , - though you may be safe from the French law , will you be safe from the English ? You may be innocent , Jasper Losely ; if so , fear nothing . You may be guilty : if so , hide , or follow me ! "
153793	153796	153798	153798	he	5325	" Pray , "
153817	153828	153798	153798	he	5325	" pray , how did you learn all these particulars ? "
153829	153895	153901	153901	Jasper	721	" From a detective policeman employed to discover Sophy . In conferring with him , the name of Jasper Losely as her legal protector was of course stated ; that name was already coupled with the name of the false Caumartin . Thus , indirectly , the child you would have consigned to that woman saves you from sharing that woman 's ignominy and doom . "
153896	153899	153901	153901	Jasper	721	" Stuff ! "
153912	154025	154178	154178	She	5331	" I do n't , on reflection , see that anything can be proved against me . I am not bound to know why a lady changes her name , nor how she comes by her money . And as to her credit with tradesmen , - nothing to speak of : most of what she has got is paid for ; what is not paid for is less than the worth of her goods . Pooh ! I am not so easily frightened ; much obliged to you all the same . Go home now ; ' t is horridly late . Good - night , or rather good - morning . "
154026	154072	154101	154101	he	5327	" Jasper , mark me , if you see that woman again ; if you attempt to save or screen her , - I shall know , and you lose in me your last friend , last hope , last plank in a devouring sea ! "
154089	154100	154101	154101	he	5327	" I have no wish to screen or save her , "
154108	154141	154178	154178	She	5331	" And after what you have said I would as soon enter a fireship as that house . But let me have some hours to consider what is best to be done . "
154142	154155	154361	154362	Mr. Gotobed	666	" Yes , consider - I shall expect you to - morrow . "
154389	154399	154454	154455	Mr. Gotobed	666	" that the visit might prove to his advantage ! "
154444	154452	154454	154455	Mr. Gotobed	666	" I beg your pardon , sir , "
154461	154656	154662	154666	the miserable and imprudent Rugge	438	" but I heard a day or two ago accidentally from my head clerk , who had learned it also accidentally from a sporting friend , that you were exhibiting at Humberston , during the race - week , a young actress , named on the play - bills here is one ' Juliet Araminta , ' and whom , as I am informed , you had previously exhibited in Surrey and elsewhere ; but she was supposed to have relinquished that earlier engagement , and left your stage with her grandfather , William Waife . I am instructed by a distinguished client , who is wealthy , and who from motives of mere benevolence interests himself in the said William and Sophy Waife , to discover their residence . Please , therefore , to render up the child to my charge , apprising me also of the address of her grandfather , if he be not with you ; and without waiting for further instructions from my client , who is abroad , I will venture to say that any sacrifice in the loss of your juvenile actress will be most liberally compensated . "
154657	154660	154662	154666	the miserable and imprudent Rugge	438	" Sir , "
154668	154711	154744	154744	he	438	" I paid L100 for that fiendish child , - a three years ' engagement , - and I have been robbed . Restore me the L100 , and I will tell you where she is , and her vile grandfather also . "
154738	154742	154744	154744	he	438	" Mr. Rugge , "
154746	154787	154734	154734	his	438	" I understand from your words that you can not place the child Sophy , alias Juliet Araminta , in my hands . You ask L100 to inform me where she is . Have you a lawful claim on her ? "
154788	154798	154744	154744	he	438	" Certainly , sir : she is my property . "
154799	154841	154734	154734	his	438	" Then it is quite clear that though you may know where she is , you can not get at her yourself , and can not , therefore , place her in my hands . Perhaps she 's - in Heaven ! "
154842	154860	154744	154744	he	438	" Confound her , sir ! no - in America ! or on the seas to it . "
154861	154866	154734	154734	his	438	" Are you sure ? "
154867	154898	154744	154744	he	438	" I have just come from the steam - packet office , and seen the names in their book . William and Sophy Waife sailed from Liverpool last Thursday week . "
154899	154925	154954	154954	Rugge	438	" And they formed an engagement with you , received your money ; broke the one , absconded with the other . Bad characters indeed ! "
154926	154952	154954	154954	Rugge	438	" Bad ! you may well say that , - a set of swindling scoundrels , the whole kit and kin . And the ingratitude ! "
154956	154966	154967	154967	he	438	" I was more than a father to that child "
154972	155007	155059	155059	his	666	" I had a babe of my own once ; died of convulsions in teething . I thought that child would have supplied its place , and I dreamed of the York Theatre ; but "
155065	155119	155059	155059	his	666	" Sir , you have been very ill - treated , I perceive . I must wish you good - day ; I have an engagement in the City . I can not help you back to your L100 , but accept this trifle a L5 note for your loss of time in calling "
155125	155134	155539	155539	He	438	" Door , - show out this gentleman . "
155550	155559	155539	155539	He	438	" Ma'am , they 're off to America ! "
155560	155577	155539	155539	He	438	" So I have heard . You are fairly entitled to the return of your money - "
155578	155586	155539	155539	He	438	" Entitled , of course , but - "
155587	155603	155644	155645	Mrs. Crane	482	" There it is ; restore to me the contract for the child 's services . "
155637	155642	155669	155670	Mrs. Crane	482	" First the contract , "
155662	155667	155669	155670	Mrs. Crane	482	" Henceforth , then , "
155672	155699	155744	155744	Rugge	438	" you have no right to complain ; and whether or not the girl ever again fall in your way , your claim over her ceases . "
155700	155743	155763	155763	Bridget	734	" The gods be praised ! it does , ma'am , I have had quite enough of her . But you are every inch a lady , and allow me to add that I put you on my free list for life . "
155755	155761	155763	155763	Bridget	734	" Lor ' , miss , "
155767	155792	155798	155799	Arabella Crane	730	" who 'd think you 'd been up all night raking ! I have not seen you look so well this many a year . "
155793	155796	155798	155799	Arabella Crane	730	" Ah , "
155801	155846	155908	155909	Mrs. Crane	482	" I will tell you why . I have done what for many a year I never thought I should do again , - a good action . That child , - that Sophy , - do you remember how cruelly I used her ? "
155847	155907	155911	155911	her	482	" Oh , miss , do n't go for to blame yourself ; you fed her , you clothed her , when her own father , the villing , sent her away from hisself to you , - you of all people , you . How could you be caressing and fawning on his child , - their child ? "
155915	156020	156032	156032	Bridget	734	" What is past is past . I have lived to save that child , and a curse seems lifted from my soul . Now listen . I shall leave London - England - probably this evening . You will keep this house ; it will be ready for me any moment I return . The agent who collects my house - rents will give you money as you want it . Stint not yourself , Bridget . I have been saving and saving and saving for dreary years , - nothing else to interest me , and I am richer than I seem . "
156021	156030	155911	155911	her	482	" But where are you going , miss ? "
156046	156057	155911	155911	her	482	" I do n't know ; I do n't care . "
156058	156089	155911	155911	her	482	" Oh , gracious stars ! is it with that dreadful Jasper Losely ? - it is , it is . You are crazed , you are bewitched , miss ! "
156090	156198	156282	156282	she	5365	" Possibly I am crazed , - possibly bewitched ; but I take that man 's life to mine as a penance for all the evil mine has ever known ; and a day or two since I should have said , with rage and shame , ' I can not help it ; I loathe myself that I can care what becomes of him . ' Now , without rage , without shame , I say , ' The man whom I once so loved shall not die on a gibbet if I can help it ' and , please Heaven , help it I will . "
156245	156281	156376	156376	He	5366	" Go now , Bridget ; I have said all . He will be here soon : he will come ; he must come ; he has no choice ; and then - and then - "
156406	156415	157236	157236	they	5410	" All is up ; here I am ! "
157239	157252	157631	157635	No company in the house	5436	" Oh , that for me some home like this would smile ! "
157642	157649	157772	157773	the visitor	3676	" No acquaintance in a city . "
157764	157770	157772	157773	the visitor	3676	" Ah , Lady Montfort , "
157778	157789	157798	157799	the lady	3801	" I am so glad to find you at home . "
157790	157796	157798	157799	the lady	3801	" At home , George ! "
157805	157827	157896	157896	he	562	" where else is it likely that I should be found ? But how pale you are ! What has happened ? "
157890	157895	157896	157896	he	562	" What has happened ! "
157899	157913	157869	157870	Lady Montfort	770	" nothing new . I have just come from visiting the good bishop . "
157914	157923	157896	157896	he	562	" He does not hesitate to ordain you ? "
157924	157937	157869	157870	Lady Montfort	770	" No ; but I shall never ask him to do so . "
157938	157980	157994	157994	he	562	" My dear cousin , are you not over - scrupulous ? You would be an ornament to the Church , sufficient in all else to justify your compulsory omission of one duty , which a curate could perform for you . "
157987	157992	157994	157994	he	562	" One duty omitted ! "
157996	158081	158400	158404	the Archimandrite of his college	5466	" But is it not that duty which distinguishes the priest from the layman ? and how far extends that duty ? Whereever there needs a voice to speak the word , - not in the pulpit only , but at the hearth , by the sick - bed , - there should be the Pastor ! No : I can not , I ought not , I dare not ! Incompetent as the labourer , how can I be worthy of the hire ? "
158406	158418	158372	158374	a profound theologian	5464	" What a pity you can not go into the Church ! "
158419	158431	158400	158404	the Archimandrite of his college	5466	" Can not ; but I am going into the Church . "
158432	158450	158372	158374	a profound theologian	5464	" You ! is it possible ? But , perhaps , you are sure of a living - "
158451	158457	158400	158404	the Archimandrite of his college	5466	" Yes , - Humberston . "
158458	158494	158372	158374	a profound theologian	5464	" An immense living , but a very large population . Certainly it is in the bishop 's own discretionary power to ordain you , and for all the duties you can keep a curate . "
158506	158508	158372	158374	a profound theologian	5464	" but "
158517	158535	158537	158538	George Morley	562	" It may be a good thing for you ; but is it fair for the Church ? "
158543	158545	159784	159784	they	14087	" but "
159788	159791	159962	159962	she	770	" Puseyite . "
159894	159933	159969	159969	she	770	" Mine is the main responsibility . But if you ask me to ordain you , I will do so without hesitation ; for if the Church wants preachers , it also wants deep scholars and virtuous pastors . "
159965	159968	159969	159969	she	770	" George , "
159991	160077	160210	160210	he	562	" I must not argue with you : I bow before the grandeur of your motives , and I will not say that you are not right . One thing I do feel , that if you thus sacrifice your inclinations and interests from scruples so pure and holy , you will never be to be pitied ; you will never know regret . Poor or rich , single or wedded , a soul that so seeks to reflect heaven will be serene and blessed . "
160222	160260	160342	160342	she	770	" What a counsellor you are ! what a soother ! If Montfort were but less prosperous or more ambitious , what a treasure , either to console or to sustain , in a mind like yours ! "
160324	160341	160385	160385	he	5551	" Lord Montfort values me , as it is , far beyond my merits : far , "
160352	160384	160401	160401	he	5551	" Forgive me ; I have displeased you . I did not mean it . Heaven forbid that I should presume either to disparage Lord Montfort - or - or to - "
160397	160400	160401	160401	he	5551	" Only , "
160408	160443	160456	160456	her	770	" only forgive me this once . Recollect I was a little boy when you were a young lady , and I have pelted you with snowballs , and called you ' Caroline ' . "
160472	160474	160529	160529	he	562	" Caroline "
160522	160527	160529	160529	he	562	" By the by , "
160531	160581	160641	160641	she	5554	" I have a letter from Mr. Carr Vipont , asking me to give him a sketch for a Gothic bridge to the water yonder . I will , with your leave , walk down and look at the proposed site . Only do say that you forgive me . "
160582	160640	160641	160641	she	5554	" Forgive you , cousin George , oh , yes ! One word only : it is true you were a child still when I fancied I was a woman , and you have a right to talk to me upon all things , except those that relate to me and Lord Montfort ; unless , indeed , "
160649	160707	160857	160858	fine ladies	5565	" unless you ever see cause to scold me , there . Good - by , my cousin , and in turn forgive me , if I was so petulant . The Caroline you pelted with snowballs was always a wayward , impulsive creature , quick to take offence , to misunderstand , and - to repent . "
160853	160856	160864	160867	those same fine ladies	5566	" Nothing , "
160877	160880	160917	160917	she	770	" All . "
160951	160969	161017	161018	Lady Montfort	770	" Treasure ! I ! I ! worthless , fickle , credulous fool ! I ! I ! "
161003	161015	161017	161018	Lady Montfort	770	" I shall be more alone in a court than here , "
161028	161040	161175	161175	Thomson	850	" Much corn lies under the straw that is not seen . "
161177	161180	161853	161861	a man , elderly , but fresh and vigorous	5609	" Seasons ; "
161828	161841	161894	161894	he	5609	" Do not despond , sir , I undertake to cure you , "
161901	161924	161959	161959	he	667	" I was in the shade of the thicket yonder , sir ; pardon me , I could not help hearing you . "
161952	161958	161959	161959	he	667	" You can cure me , "
161963	161984	161941	161941	he	667	" what of ? - the folly of trying to speak in public ? Thank you , I am cured . "
161985	162031	161959	161959	he	667	" Nay , sir , you see before you a man who can make you a very good speaker . Your voice is naturally fine . I repeat , I can cure a defect which is not in the organ , but in the management ! "
162032	162044	161941	161941	he	667	" You can ! you - who and what are you ? "
162045	162057	161959	161959	he	667	" A basketmaker , sir ; I hope for your custom . "
162058	162071	161941	161941	he	667	" Surely this is not the first time I have seen you ? "
162072	162098	162207	162207	he	654	" True , you once kindly suffered me to borrow a resting - place on your father 's land . One good turn deserves another . "
162200	162206	162207	162207	he	654	" And your little girl ? "
162214	162231	162255	162255	He	654	" Better than she was when we last met . Providence is so kind to us . "
162269	162399	162405	162406	the scholar	3036	" Yes , sir , we have just settled in this neighbourhood . I have a pretty cottage yonder at the outskirts of the village , and near the park pales . I recognized you at once ; and as I heard you just now , I called to mind that when we met before , you said your calling should be the Church , were it not for your difficulty in utterance ; and I said to myself , ' No bad thing those pebbles , if his utterance were thick , which is it not ; ' and I have not a doubt , sir , that the true fault of Demosthenes , whom I presume you are imitating , was that he spoke through his nose . "
162400	162403	162405	162406	the scholar	3036	" Eh ! "
162408	162422	162255	162255	He	654	" through his nose ? I never knew that ? - and I - "
162423	162448	162405	162406	the scholar	3036	" And you are trying to speak without lungs ; that is without air in them . You do n't smoke , I presume ? "
162449	162455	162255	162255	He	654	" No ; certainly not . "
162456	162539	162550	162552	the learned man	5617	" You must learn ; speak between each slow puff of your pipe . All you want is time , - time to quiet the nerves , time to think , time to breathe . The moment you begin to stammer , stop , fill the lungs thus , then try again ! It is only a clever man who can learn to write , - that is , to compose ; but any fool can be taught to speak . Courage ! "
162540	162548	162565	162566	Mrs. Crane	482	" If you really can teach me , "
162580	162599	162405	162406	the scholar	3036	" if you can teach me ; if I can but con - con - con - conq - "
162600	162628	162565	162566	Mrs. Crane	482	" Slowly , slowly , breath and time ; take a whiff from my pipe ; that 's right . Yes , you can conquer the impediment . "
162629	162651	162405	162406	the scholar	3036	" Then I will be the best friend to you that man ever had . There 's my hand on it . "
162652	162710	162565	162566	Mrs. Crane	482	" I take it , but I ask leave to change the parties in the contract . I do n't want a friend : I do n't deserve one . You 'll be a friend to my little girl instead ; and if ever I ask you to help me in aught for her welfare and happiness - "
162711	162773	162774	162774	Waife	423	" I will help , heart and soul ! slight indeed any service to her or to you compared with such service to me . Free this wretched tongue from its stammer , and thought and zeal will not stammer whenever you say , ' Keep your promise . ' I am so glad your little girl is still with you . "
162778	162788	162813	162813	He	423	" Is still with me ! - why not ? "
162819	162827	162565	162566	Mrs. Crane	482	" When shall I begin my lesson ? "
162828	162844	162813	162813	He	423	" Now , if you like . But have you a book in your pocket ? "
162845	162850	162565	162566	Mrs. Crane	482	" I always have . "
162851	162860	162813	162813	He	423	" Not Greek , I hope , sir ? "
162861	162886	162565	162566	Mrs. Crane	482	" No , a volume of Barrow 's Sermons . Lord Chatham recommended those sermons to his great son as a study for eloquence . "
162887	162921	163306	163307	quoth Waife	423	" Good ! Will you lend me the volume , sir ? and now for it . Listen to me ; one sentence at a time ; draw your breath when I do . "
163302	163305	163306	163307	quoth Waife	423	" Nay , "
163309	163330	163696	163696	Waife	423	" instead of a drawback , become but an orator , and you will convert a defect into a beauty . "
163684	163694	163696	163696	Waife	423	" It is for my sake I ask this , "
163700	163710	164786	164786	he	855	" though I might say it was for yours ; "
164811	164814	164904	164904	Morley	855	" taken in "
164896	164900	164904	164904	Morley	855	" In fact , "
164906	165072	165209	165209	Waife	423	" a character so bad that Mr. Hartopp was too glad to give up to her lawful protectors the child , whom the man appears to have abducted ; and I suspect , from what Hartopp said , though he does not like to own that he was taken in to so gross a degree , that he had been actually introducing to his fellow - townsfolk and conferring familiarly with a regular jail - bird , - perhaps a burglar . How lucky for that poor , soft - headed , excellent Jos Hartopp , whom it is positively as inhuman to take in as it would be to defraud a born natural , that the lady you saw arrived in time to expose the snares laid for his benevolent credulity . But for that , Jos might have taken the fellow into his own house just like him ! , and been robbed by this time , perhaps murdered , - Heaven knows ! "
165204	165207	165209	165209	Waife	423	" Hush ! "
165211	165225	165349	165349	Waife	423	" and mark how the rudest musical sound can affect the brute creation . "
165326	165347	165349	165349	Waife	423	" I do n't think the story of Orpheus charming the brutes was a fable ; do you , sir ? "
165351	165454	165455	165456	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" The rabbits about here know me already ; and , if I had but a fiddle , I would undertake to make friends with that reserved and unsocial water - rat , on whom Sir Isaac in vain endeavours at present to force his acquaintance . Man commits a great mistake in not cultivating more intimate and amicable relations with the other branches of earth 's great family . Few of them not more amusing than we are ; naturally , for they have not our cares . And such variety of character too , where you would least expect it ! "
165459	165474	165475	165475	WAIFE	423	" Very true . Cowper noticed marked differences of character in his favourite hares . "
165478	165705	165706	165707	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" Hares ! I am sure that there are not two house - flies on a window - pane , two minnows in that water , that would not present to us interesting points of contrast as to temper and disposition . If house - flies and minnows could but coin money , or set up a manufacture , - contrive something , in short , to buy or sell attractive to Anglo - Saxon enterprise and intelligence , - of course we should soon have diplomatic relations with them ; and our despatches and newspapers would instruct us to a T in the characters and propensities of their leading personages . But , where man has no pecuniary nor ambitious interests at stake in his commerce with any class of his fellow - creatures , his information about them is extremely confused and superficial . The best naturalists are mere generalizers , and think they have done a vast deal when they classify a species . What should we know about mankind if we had only a naturalist 's definition of man ? We only know mankind by knocking classification on the head , and studying each man as a class in himself . Compare Buffon and Shakspeare ! Alas , sir ! can we never have a Shakspeare for house - flies and minnows ? "
165710	165746	165747	165747	WAIFE	423	" With all respect for minnows and house - flies , if we found another Shakspeare , he might be better employed , like his predecessor , in selecting individualities from the classifications of man . "
165750	165821	165822	165823	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" Being yourself a man , you think so : a housefly might be of a different opinion . But permit me , at least , to doubt whether such an investigator would be better employed in reference to his own happiness , though I grant that he would be so in reference to your intellectual amusement and social interests . Poor Shakspeare ! How much he must have suffered ! "
165826	165901	165907	165907	Waife	423	" You mean that he must have been racked by the passions he describes , - bruised by collision with the hearts he dissects . That is not necessary to genius . The judge on his bench , summing up evidence and charging the jury , has no need to have shared the temptations or been privy to the acts of the prisoner at the bar . Yet how consummate may be his analysis ! "
165902	165905	165907	165907	Waife	423	" No , "
165911	166114	166188	166188	WAIFE	423	" No ! Your illustration destroys your argument . The judge knows nothing of the prisoner . There are the circumstances ; there is the law . By these he generalizes , by these he judges , - right or wrong . But of the individual at the bar , of the world - the tremendous world - within that individual heart , I repeat , he knows nothing . Did he know , law and circumstances might vanish , human justice would be paralyzed . Ho , there ! place that swart - visaged , ill - looking foreigner in the dock , and let counsel open the case ; hear the witnesses depose ! Oh , horrible wretch ! a murderer ! unmanly murderer ! - a defenceless woman smothered by caitiff hands ! Hang him up ! hang him up ! ' Softly , ' whispers the POET , and lifts the veil from the assassin 's heart . ' Lo ! it is Othello the Moor ! ' What jury now dare find that criminal guilty ? what judge now put on the black cap ? who now says , ' Hang him up ! hang him up ! "
166195	166385	166386	166387	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" Why do we sympathize with those above us more than with those below ? why with the sorrows of a king rather than those of a beggar ? why does Sir Isaac sympathize with me more than let that water - rat vex him ever so much I can possibly sympathize with him ? Whatever be the cause , see at least , Mr. Morley , one reason why a poor creature like myself finds it better employment to cultivate the intimacy of brutes than to prosecute the study of men . Among men , all are too high to sympathize with me ; but I have known two friends who never injured nor betrayed . Sir Isaac is one ; Wamba was another . Wamba , sir , the native of a remote district of the globe two friends civilized Europe is not large enough to afford any one man , Wamba , sir , was less gifted by nature , less refined by education , than Sir Isaac ; but he was a safe and trustworthy companion : Wamba , sir , was - an opossum . "
166390	166410	166411	166411	WAIFE	433	" Alas , my dear Mr. Waife , I fear that men must have behaved very ill to you . "
166414	166452	166453	166454	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" I have no right to complain . I have behaved very ill to myself . When a man is his own enemy , he is very unreasonable if he expect other men to be his benefactors . "
166459	166491	166512	166512	he	3036	" Listen , I have a confession to make to you . I fear I have done you an injury , where , officiously , I meant to do a kindness . "
166515	166682	166683	166683	WAIFE	433	" When again I met you here , and learned that your Sophy was with you , I felt inexpressibly relieved . It was clear then , I thought , that your grandchild had been left to your care unmolested , either that you had proved not to be the person of whom the parties were in search , or family affairs had been so explained and reconciled that my interference had occasioned you no harm . But to - day I have a letter from my father which disquiets me much . It seems that the persons in question did visit Gatesboro ' , and have maligned you to Mr. Hartopp . Understand me , I ask for no confidence which you may be unwilling to give ; but if you will arm me with the power to vindicate your character from aspersions which I need not your assurance to hold unjust and false , I will not rest till that task be triumphantly accomplished . "
166692	166879	166903	166903	he	3047	" I thank you with all my heart . But there is nothing to be done . I am glad that the subject did not start up between us until such little service as I could render you , Mr. Morley , was pretty well over . It would have been a pity if you had been compelled to drop all communication with a man of attainted character , before you had learned how to manage the powers that will enable you hereafter to exhort sinners worse than I have been . Hush , sir ! you feel that , at least now , I am an inoffensive old man , labouring for a humble livelihood . You will not repeat here what you may have heard , or yet hear , to the discredit of my former life . You will not send me and my grandchild forth from our obscure refuge to confront a world with which we have no strength to cope . And , believing this , it only remains for me to say , Fare - you - well , sir . "
166880	166893	166903	166903	he	3047	" I should deserve to lose spe - spe - speech altogether , "
166911	166922	166935	166936	the Comedian	1587	" if I suffered - suff - suff - suff - "
166923	166933	166983	166983	he	3047	" One , two ! take time , sir ! "
167014	167117	166983	166983	he	3047	" You do not guess what you have done for me ; you have secured to me a home and a career ; the wife of whom I must otherwise have despaired ; the Divine Vocation on which all my earthly hopes were set , and which I was on the eve of renouncing : do not think these are obligations which can be lightly shaken off . If there are circumstances which forbid me to disabuse others of impressions which wrong you , imagine not that their false notions will affect my own gratitude , - my own respect for you ! "
167118	167174	166983	166983	he	3047	" Nay , sir ! they ought ; they must . Perhaps not your exaggerated gratitude for a service which you should not , however , measure by its effects on yourself , but by the slightness of the trouble it gave to me ; not perhaps your gratitude , but your respect , yes . "
167175	167370	167383	167383	Waife	433	" I tell you no ! Do you fancy that I can not judge of a man 's nature without calling on him to trust me with all the secrets - all the errors , if you will - of his past life ? Will not the calling to which I may now hold myself destined give me power and commandment to absolve all those who truly repent and unfeignedly believe ? Oh , Mr. Waife ! if in earlier days you have sinned , do you not repent ? and how often , in many a lovely gentle sentence dropped unawares from your lips , have I had cause to know that you unfeignedly believe ! Were I now clothed with sacred authority , could I not absolve you as a priest ? Think you that , in the meanwhile , I dare judge you as a man ? I , - Life 's new recruit , guarded hitherto from temptation by careful parents and favouring fortune , - I presume to judge , and judge harshly , the gray - haired veteran , wearied by the march , wounded in the battle ! "
167371	167381	167383	167383	Waife	433	" You are a noble - hearted human being , "
167388	167505	167506	167506	George	855	" And , mark my words , a mantle of charity so large you will live to wear as a robe of honour . But hear me , sir ! Mr. Hartopp also is a man infinitely charitable , benevolent , kindly , and , through all his simplicity , acutely shrewd ; Mr. Hartopp , on hearing what was said against me , deemed me unfit to retain my grandchild , resigned the trust I had confided to him , and would have given me alms , no doubt , had I asked them , but not his hand . Take your hands , sir , from my shoulder , lest the touch sully you . "
167535	167633	167710	167712	the old man	1741	" You are innocent ! you are innocent ! forgive me that I spoke to you of repentance as if you had been guilty . I feel you are innocent , - feel it by my own heart . You turn away . I defy you to say that you are guilty of what has been laid to your charge , of what has darkened your good name , of what Mr. Hartopp believed to your prejudice . Look me in the face and say , ' I am not innocent ; I have not been belied . "
167727	167905	167957	167957	George	855	" Forget that I may soon be the Christian minister whose duty bows his ear to the lips of Shame and Guilt ; whose hand , when it points to Heaven , no mortal touch can sully ; whose sublimest post is by the sinner 's side . Look on me but as man and gentleman . See , I now extend this hand to you . If , as man and gentleman , you have done that which , could all hearts be read , all secrets known , human judgment reversed by Divine omniscience , forbids you to take this hand , - then reject it , go hence : we part ! But if no such act be on your conscience , however you submit to its imputation , - THEN , in the name of Truth , as man and gentleman to man and gentleman , I command you to take this right hand , and , in the name of that Honour which bears no paltering , I forbid you to disobey . "
167951	167955	167957	167957	George	855	" You know , "
167963	167995	168007	168007	Waife	433	" that the hand you have taken will never betray , never desert ; but is it - is it really powerless to raise and to restore you to your place ? "
167996	168005	168007	168007	Waife	433	" Powerless amongst your kind for that indeed , "
168015	168125	167957	167957	George	855	" All the kings of the earth are not strong enough to raise a name that has once been trampled into the mire . Learn that it is not only impossible for me to clear myself , but that it is equally impossible for me to confide to mortal being a single plea in defence if I am innocent , in extenuation if I am guilty . And saying this , and entreating you to hold it more merciful to condemn than to question me , - for question is torture , - I can not reject your pity ; but it would be mockery to offer me respect ! "
168126	168195	168201	168201	Waife	433	" What ! not respect the fortitude which calumny can not crush ? Would that fortitude be possible if you were not calm in the knowledge that no false witnesses can mislead the Eternal Judge ? Respect you ! yes , - because I have seen you happy in despite of men , and therefore I know that the cloud around you is not the frown of Heaven . "
168196	168199	168252	168252	he	433	" Oh , "
168210	168250	168252	168252	he	433	" and not an hour ago I was jesting at human friendship , venting graceless spleen on my fellow - men ! And now - now - ah , sir ! Providence is so kind to me ! And , "
168274	168579	168946	168946	he	5756	" and kind to me in the very quarter in which unkindness had so sorely smitten me . True , you directed towards me the woman who took from me my grandchild , who destroyed me in the esteem of good Mr. Hartopp . Well , you see , I have my sweet Sophy back again ; we are in the home of all others I most longed for ; and that woman , yes , I can , at least , thus far , confide to you my secrets , so that you may not blame yourself for sending her to Gatesboro ' , - that very woman knows of my shelter ; furnished me with the very reference necessary to obtain it ; has freed my grandchild from a loathsome bondage , which I could not have legally resisted ; and should new persecutions chase us will watch and warn and help us . And if you ask me how this change in her was effected ; how , when we had abandoned all hope of green fields , and deemed that only in the crowd of a city we could escape those who pursued us when discovered there , though I fancied myself an adept in disguise , and the child and the dog were never seen out of the four garret walls in which I hid them , - if you ask me , I say , to explain how that very woman was suddenly converted from a remorseless foe into a saving guardian , I can only answer ' By no wit , no device , no persuasive art of mine . Providence softened her heart , and made it kind , just at a moment when no other agency on earth could have rescued us from - from - "
168580	168655	168252	168252	he	433	" Say no more : I guess ! the paper this woman showed me was a legal form authorizing your poor little Sophy to be given up to the care of a father . I guess ! of that father you would not speak ill to me ; yet from that father you would save your grandchild . Say no more . And yon quiet home , your humble employment , really content you ? "
168656	168756	168946	168946	he	5756	" Oh , if such a life can but last ! Sophy is so well , so cheerful , so happy . Did not you bear her singing the other day ? She never used to sing ! But we had not been here a week when song broke out from her , - untaught , as from a bird . But if any ill report of me travel hither from Gatesboro ' or elsewhere , we should be sent away , and the bird would be mute in my thorn - tree : Sophy would sing no more . "
168757	168861	168872	168872	Waife	442	" Do not fear that slander shall drive you hence . Lady Montfort , you know , is my cousin , but you know not - few do - how thoroughly generous and gentle - hearted she is . I will speak of you to her , - oh ! do not look alarmed . She will take my word when I tell her , ' That is a good man ; ' and if she ask more , it will be enough to say , ' Those who have known better days are loth to speak to strangers of the past . ' "
168862	168870	168946	168946	he	5756	" I thank you earnestly , sincerely , "
168877	168945	169086	169086	Waife	442	" One favour more : if you saw in the formal document shown to you , or retain on your memory , the name of - of the person authorized to claim Sophy as his child , you will not mention it to Lady Montfort . I am hot sure if ever she heard that name , but she may have done so , and - and - "
168965	169084	169156	169156	Waife	442	" You are so good to me , Mr. Morley , that I wish to confide in you as far as I can . Now , you see , I am already an old man , and my chief object is to raise up a friend for Sophy when I am gone , - a friend in her own sex , sir . Oh , you can not guess how I long , how I yearn , to view that child under the holy fostering eyes of a woman . Perhaps if Lady Montfort saw my pretty Sophy she might take a fancy to her . Oh , if she did ! if she did ! And Sophy , "
169090	169154	169156	169156	Waife	442	" has a right to respect . She is not like me , - any hovel is good enough for me ; but for her ! Do you know that I conceived that hope , that the hope helped to lead me back here when , months ago , I was at Humberston , intent upon rescuing Sophy ; and saw - though , "
169169	169339	169340	169341	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" I had no right at that precise moment to be seeing anything - Lady Montfort 's humane fear for a blind old impostor , who was trying to save his dog - a black dog , sir , who had dyed his hair - from her carriage wheels . And the hope became stronger still , when , the first Sunday I attended yon village church , I again saw that fair - wondrously fair - face at the far end , - fair as moonlight and as melancholy . Strange it is , sir , that I - naturally a boisterous , mirthful man , and now a shy , skulking fugitive - feel more attracted , more allured towards a countenance , in proportion as I read there the trace of sadness . I feel less abased by my own nothingness , more emboldened to approach and say , ' Not so far apart from me : thou too hast suffered . ' Why is this ? "
169344	169428	169682	169685	the ex - Comedian	5763	" ' The fool hath said in his heart that there is no God ; ' but the fool hath not said in his heart that there is no sorrow , - pithy and most profound sentence ; intimating the irrefragable claim that binds men to the Father . And when the chain tightens , the children are closer drawn together . But to your wish : I will remember it . And when my cousin returns , she shall see your Sophy . "
169698	169875	169883	169883	George	855	" To tell you the truth , sir , I have rather a superstition against having more money in my hands than I know what to do with . It has always brought me bad luck . And what is very hard , - the bad luck stays , but the money goes . There was that splendid sum I made at Gatesboro ' . You should have seen me counting it over . I could not have had a prouder or more swelling heart if I had been , that great man Mr. Elwes the miser . And what bad luck it brought me , and how it all frittered itself away ! Nothing to show for it but a silk ladder and an old hurdy - gurdy , and I sold them at half price . Then when I had the accident , which cost me this eye , the railway people behaved so generously , gave me L120 , - think of that ! And before three days the money was all gone ! "
169876	169881	169883	169883	George	855	" How was that ? "
169898	169898	169905	169905	Waife	442	"
169899	169903	169905	169905	Waife	442	" Not so , "
169910	170181	169682	169685	the ex - Comedian	5763	" but restored . A poor dear old man , who thought very ill of me , and I do n't wonder at it , - was reduced from great wealth to great poverty . While I was laid up , my landlady read a newspaper to me , and in that newspaper was an account of his reverse and destitution . But I was accountable to him for the balance of an old debt , and that , with the doctor 's bills , quite covered my L120 . I hope he does not think quite so ill of me now . But the money brought good luck to him , rather than to me . Well , sir , if you were now to give me money , I should be on the look - out for some mournful calamity . Gold is not natural to me . Some day , however , by and by , when you are inducted into your living , and have become a renowned preacher , and have plenty to spare , with an idea that you will feel more comfortable in your mind if you had done something royal for the basketmaker , I will ask you to help me to make up a sum , which I am trying by degrees to save , - an enormous sum , almost as much as I paid away from my railway compensation : I owe it to the lady who lent it to release Sophy from an engagement which I - certainly without any remorse of conscience - made the child break . "
170182	170200	169905	169905	Waife	442	" Oh , yes ! What is the amount ? Let me at least repay that debt . "
170201	170304	169682	169685	the ex - Comedian	5763	" Not yet . The lady can wait ; and she would be pleased to wait , because she deserves to wait : it would be unkind to her to pay it off at once . But in the meanwhile if you could send me a few good books for Sophy , - instructive , yet not very , very dry,-and a French dictionary , I can teach her French when the winter days close in . You see I am not above being paid , sir . But , Mr. Morley , there is a great favour you can do me . "
170305	170312	169905	169905	Waife	442	" What is it ? Speak . "
170313	170364	169682	169685	the ex - Comedian	5763	" Cautiously refrain from doing me a great disservice ! You are going back to your friends and relations . Never speak of me to them . Never describe me and my odd ways . Name not the lady , nor - nor - nor - the man who claimed Sophy .
170365	170413	169905	169905	Waife	442	" Your friends might not hurt me ; others might . Talk travels . The hare is not long in its form when it has a friend in a hound that gives tongue . Promise what I ask . Promise it as ' man and gentleman . ' "
170414	170479	170487	170487	Waife	442	" Certainly . Yet I have one relation to whom I should like , with your permission , to speak of you , with whom I could wish you acquainted . He is so thorough a man of the world , that he might suggest some method to clear your good name , which you yourself would approve . My uncle , Colonel Morley - "

I do not doubt that George will be a very distinguished clergyman . "
177178	177271	177280	177280	his	841	" We want one ; the House wants a very distinguished clergyman : we have none at this moment , - not a bishop , not even a dean ! all mere parish parsons , and among them not one we could push . Very odd , with more than forty livings too . But the Viponts seldom take to the Church kindly : George must be pushed . The more I think of it , the more we want a bishop : a bishop would be useful in the present CRISIS . "

For all the use he is to us , he might as well be dead ! But he has a fine fortune : what will he do with it ? "
177491	177506	177507	177508	LADY MONTFORT	770	" My dear Lady Montfort , you have hurt yourself with that paper cutter . "
177511	177525	177545	177546	CARR VIPONT	841	" NO , indeed . Hush ! we are disturbing Mr. Carr Vipont ! "
177552	177565	177566	177567	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" A very fine fortune : what will he do with it ? "
177570	177587	177588	177589	CARR VIPONT	841	" I do n't know ; but I had a letter from him some months ago . "
177592	177601	177602	177603	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" You had , and never told me ! "
177606	177652	177653	177654	CARR VIPONT	841	" Of no importance to you , my dear Carr . His letter merely introduced to me a charming young fellow , - a kinsman of his own no Vipont , - Lionel Haughton , son of poor Charlie Haughton , whom you may remember . "
177657	177683	177684	177685	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Yes , a handsome scamp ; went to the dogs . So Darrell takes up Charlie 's son : what ! as his heir ? "
177688	177702	177703	177704	CARR VIPONT	841	" In his letter to me he anticipated that question in the negative . "
177707	177714	177715	177716	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Has Darrell any nearer kinsman ? "
177719	177726	177727	177728	CARR VIPONT	841	" Not that I know of . "
177731	177755	177756	177757	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Perhaps he will select one of his wife 's family for his heir , - a Vipont ; I should not wonder . "
177761	177784	177785	177786	CARR VIPONT	841	" I should . But why may not Darrell marry again ? I always thought he would ; I think so still . "
177795	177881	177882	177883	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Well , a wife well chosen might restore him to society , and to us . Pity , indeed , that so great an intellect should be suspended , - a voice so eloquent hushed . You are right ; in this CRISIS , Guy Darrell once more in the House of Commons , we should have all we require , - an orator , a debater ! Very odd , but at this moment we have no speakers , - WE the Viponts ! "
177886	177889	177890	177891	CARR VIPONT	841	" Yourself ! "
177894	177966	177967	177968	Lord Montfort	737	" You are too kind . I can speak on occasions ; but regularly , no . Too much drudgery ; not young enough to take to it now . So you think Darrell will marry again ? A remarkably fine - looking fellow when I last saw him : not old yet ; I dare say well preserved . I wish I had thought of asking him here - Montfort ! "
177996	178019	178020	178021	LORD MONTFORT	737	" Montfort ! only think , we forgot to invite Guy Darrell . Is it too late before our party breaks up ? "
178025	178039	178060	178060	He	737	" I do n't choose Guy Darrell to be invited to my house . "
178067	178092	178105	178106	Lord Montfort	737	" Not choose , my dear Montfort ! you are joking . A monstrous clever fellow , Guy Darrell , and at this CRISIS - "
178093	178103	178132	178133	Colonel Morley	628	" I hate clever fellows ; no such bores ! "
178121	178130	178132	178133	Colonel Morley	628	" Spare your regrets , my dear Carr , "
178135	178150	178201	178201	she	770	" Darrell is not in England : I rather believe he is in Verona . "
178190	178200	178223	178224	Lady Montfort	770	" Will you give me my revenge at chess ? "
178228	178282	178283	178284	Lady Montfort	770	" I overheard you say you had lately received a letter from Mr. Darrell . Does he write as if well , - cheerful ? You remember that I was much with his daughter , much in his house , when I was a child . He was ever most kind to me . "
178290	178503	178504	178505	LADY MONTFORT	770	" He writes with no reference to himself , his health , or his spirits . But his young kinsman described him to me as in good health , - wonderfully young - looking for his years . But cheerful , - no ! Darrell and I entered the world together ; we were friends as much as a man so busy and so eminent as he could be friends with a man like myself , indolent by habit and obscure out of Mayfair . I know his nature ; we both know something of his family sorrows . He can not be happy ! Impossible ! - alone , childless , secluded . Poor Darrell , abroad now ; in Verona , too ! - the dullest place ! in mourning still for Romeo and Juliet ! ' T is your turn to move . In his letter Darrell talked of going on to Greece , Asia , penetrating into the depths of Africa , - the wildest schemes ! Dear County Guy , as we called him at Eton ! what a career his might have been ! Do n't let us talk of him , it makes me mournful . Like Goethe , I avoid painful subjects upon principle . "
178508	178538	178560	178560	he	13877	" No ; we will not talk of him . No ; I take the Queen 's pawn . No , we will not talk of him ! no ! "
178575	178591	178610	178610	She	770	" Pray , my fair cousin , what makes Montfort dislike my old friend Darrell ? "
178592	178609	178623	178623	she	770	" Dislike ! Does he ! I do n't know . Vanquished again , Colonel Morley ! "
178630	178645	178623	178623	she	770	" This young kinsman , will he not be a comfort to Mr. Darrell ? "
178646	178732	178733	178734	Lady Montfort	770	" He would be a comfort and a pride to a father ; but to Darrell , so distant a kinsman , - comfort ! - why and how ? Darrell will provide for him , that is all . A very gentlemanlike young man ; gone to Paris by my advice ; wants polish and knowledge of life . When he comes back he must enter society : I have put his name up at White 's ; may I introduce him to you ? "
178748	178751	178895	178895	he	737	" No . "
178881	178894	178923	178923	he	737	" Come to teach me to make a cannon , I suppose ! "
178912	178921	179010	179010	she	770	" Rather in my way , Lady Montfort , "
178999	179008	179010	179010	she	770	" Your nephew comes here to - morrow , "
179012	179029	179030	179031	CHAPTER IX	730	" my old play - fellow ; impossible quite to forget old friends ; good night . "

179332	179487	179494	179495	Lady Selina	500	" girls , with much instruction and well - balanced minds , - less authoritative with the last , because boys being not under her immediate control , her sense of responsibility allowed her to display more fondness and less dignity in her intercourse with them than with young ladies who must learn from her example , as well as her precepts , the patrician decorum which becomes the smooth result of impulse restrained and emotion checked : boys might make a noise in the world , girls should make none . Lady Selina , then , was working the slippers for her absent son , her heart being full of him at that moment . She was describing his character and expatiating on his promise to two or three attentive listeners , all interested , as being themselves of the Vipont blood , in the probable destiny of the heir to the Carr Viponts .
179488	179492	179494	179495	Lady Selina	500	" In short , "
179500	179628	179645	179645	Vipont	737	" as soon as Reginald is of age we shall get him into Parliament . Carr has always lamented that he himself was not broken into office early ; Reginald must be . Nothing so requisite for public men as early training ; makes them practical , and not too sensitive to what those horrid newspaper men say . That was Pitt 's great advantage . Reginald has ambition ; he should have occupation to keep him out of mischief . It is an anxious thing for a mother , when a son is good - looking : such danger of his being spoiled by the women . Yes , my dear , it is a small foot , very small , - his father 's foot . "
179629	179638	179645	179645	Vipont	737	" If Lord Montfort should have no family , "
179651	179657	179666	179667	Lady Selina	500	" does not the title - "
179658	179664	179666	179667	Lady Selina	500	" No , my dear , "
179669	179793	179645	179645	Vipont	737	" no , the title does not come to us . It is a melancholy thought , but the marquisate , in that case , is extinct . No other heir - male from Gilbert , the first marquess . Carr says there is even likely to be some dispute about the earldom . The Barony , of course , is safe ; goes with the Irish estates , and most of the English ; and goes do n't you know ? to Sir James Vipont , the last person who ought to have it ; the quietest , stupidest creature ; not brought up to the sort of thing , - a mere gentleman - farmer on a small estate in Devonshire . "
179794	179800	179666	179667	Lady Selina	500	" He is not here ? "
179801	179872	179886	179889	one of the listeners	6220	" No . Lord Montfort does not like him . Very natural . Nobody likes his heir , if not his own child ; and some people do n't even like their own eldest sons ! Shocking ; but so it is . Montfort is the kindest , most tractable being that ever was , except where he takes a dislike . He dislikes two or three people very much . "
179873	179884	179666	179667	Lady Selina	500	" True ; how he did dislike poor Mrs. Lyndsay ! "
179893	179982	179983	179984	FIRST LISTENER	908	" Mrs. Lyndsay , yes , - dear Lady Montfort 's mother . I ca n't say I pitied her , though I was sorry for Lady Montfort . How Mrs. Lyndsay ever took in Montfort for Caroline I ca n't conceive ! How she had the face to think of it ! He , a mere youth at the time ! Kept secret from all his family , even from his grandmother , - the darkest transaction . I do n't wonder that he never forgave it . "
179987	179994	179995	179996	LADY SELINA	500	" Caroline has beauty enough to - "
180000	180078	180079	180080	SECOND LISTENER	910	" Beauty , of course : no one can deny that . But not at all suited to such a position , not brought up to the sort of thing . Poor Montfort ! he should have married a different kind of woman altogether , - a woman like his grandmother , the last Lady Montfort . Caroline does nothing for the House , - nothing ; has not even a child , - most unfortunate affair . "
180083	180115	180116	180117	LADY SELINA	500	" Mrs. Lyndsay was very poor , was not she ? Caroline , I suppose , had no opportunity of forming those tastes and habits which are necessary for - for - "
180123	180647	181122	181122	herself	770	" For such a position and such a fortune . You are quite right , my dear . People brought up in one way can not accommodate themselves to another ; and it is odd , but I have observed that people brought up poor can accommodate themselves less to being very rich than people brought up rich can accommodate themselves to being very poor . As Carr says , in his pointed way , ' It is easier to stoop than to climb . ' Yes ; Mrs. Lyndsay was , you know , a daughter of Seymour Vipont , who was for so many years in the Administration , with a fair income from his salary , and nothing out of it . She married one of the Scotch Lyndsays , - good family , of course , with a very moderate property . She was left a widow young , with an only child , Caroline . Came to town with a small jointure . The late Lady Montfort was very kind to her . So were we all ; took her up ; pretty woman ; pretty manners ; worldly , - oh , very ! I do n't like worldly people . Well , but all of a sudden a dreadful thing happened . The heir - at - law disputed the jointure , denied that Lyndsay had any right to make settlements on the Scotch property ; very complicated business . But , luckily for her , Vipont Crooke 's daughter , her cousin and intimate friend , had married Darrell , the famous Darrell , who was then at the bar . It is very useful to have cousins married to clever people . He was interested in her case , took it up . I believe it did not come on in the courts in which Darrell practised . But he arranged all the evidence , inspected the briefs , spent a great deal of his own money in getting up the case ; and in fact he gained her cause , though he could not be her counsel . People did say that she was so grateful that after his wife 's death she had set her heart on becoming Mrs. Darrell the second . But Darrell was then quite wrapped up in politics , - the last man to fall in love , and only looked bored when women fell in love with him , which a good many did . Grand - looking creature , my dear , and quite the rage for a year or two . However , Mrs. Lyndsay all of a sudden went off to Paris , and there Montfort saw Caroline , and was caught . Mrs. Lyndsay , no doubt , calculated on living with her daughter , having the run of Montfort House in town and Montfort Court in the country . But Montfort is deeper than people think for . No , he never forgave her . She was never asked here ; took it to heart , went to Rome , and died . "

181156	181166	181191	181192	Lady Montfort	770	" And I so glad to receive your congratulations , "
181180	181189	181191	181192	Lady Montfort	770	" But , George , how is this ? "
181194	181247	181122	181122	herself	770	" Bring that chair , sit down here , and tell me all about it . You wrote me word you were cured , - at least sufficiently to re move your noble scruples . You did not say how . Your uncle tells me , by patient will and resolute practice . "
181248	181272	181191	181192	Lady Montfort	770	" Under good guidance . But I am going to confide to you a secret , if you will promise to keep it . "
181273	181287	181313	181313	he	6245	" Oh , you may trust me : I have no female friends . "
181306	181312	181313	181313	he	6245	" I have his permission , "
181318	181393	181402	181403	Lady Montfort	770	" to confide the service he rendered me , the intimacy that has sprung up between us , but to you alone , - not a word to your guests . When you have once seen him , you will understand why an eccentric man , who has known better days , would shrink from the impertinent curiosity of idle customers . Contented with his humble livelihood , he asks but liberty and repose . "
181394	181400	181402	181403	Lady Montfort	770	" That I already comprehend , "
181411	181434	181313	181313	he	6245	" But my curiosity shall not molest him , and when I visit the village , I will pass by his cottage . "
181435	181475	181402	181403	Lady Montfort	770	" Nay , my dear Lady Montfort , that would be to refuse the favour I am about to ask , which is that you would come with me to that very cottage . It would so please him . "
181476	181482	181313	181313	he	6245	" Please him ! why ? "
181483	181560	181707	181707	she	6258	" Because this poor man has a young female grandchild , and he is so anxious that you should see and be kind to her , and because , too , he seems most anxious to remain in his present residence . The cottage , of course , belongs to Lord Montfort , and is let to him by the bailiff , and if you deign to feel interest in him , his tenure is safe . "

183846	184084	184212	184212	He	6366	" a precocious villain bursts in upon me , breaks my day , makes an appointment to meet me here , in these very walks , ten minutes before six ; decoys me with the promise of a dinner at Putney , - room looking on the river and fried flounders . I have the credulity to yield : I derange my habits ; I leave my cool studio ; I put off my easy blouse ; I imprison my freeborn throat in a cravat invented by the Thugs ; the dog - days are at hand , and I walk rashly over scorching pavements in a black frock - coat and a brimless hat ; I annihilate 3s . 6d . in a pair of kid gloves ; I arrive at this haunt of spleen ; I run the gauntlet of Frosts , Slowes , and Prymmes : and my traitor fails me ! Half - past six , - not a sign of him ! and the dinner at Putney , - fried flounders ? Dreams ! Patience , five minutes more ; if then he comes not , breach for life between him and me ! Ah , voila ! there he comes , the laggard ! But how those fine folks are catching at him ! Has he asked them also to dinner at Putney , and do they care for fried flounders ? "
184254	184277	184212	184212	He	6366	" Do n't scold , Vance . I am late , I know ; but I did not make allowance for interceptions . "
184278	184303	184212	184212	He	6366	" Body o ' me , interceptions ! For an absentee just arrived in London , you seem to have no lack of friends . "
184304	184333	184212	184212	He	6366	" Friends made in Paris and found again here at every corner , like pleasant surprises , - but no friend so welcome and dear as Frank Vance . "
184334	184383	184212	184212	He	6366	" Sensible of the honour , O Lionello the Magnificent . Verily you are bon prince ! The Houses of Valois and of Medici were always kind to artists . But whither would you lead me ? Back into that treadmill ? Thank you , humbly ; no . "
184384	184461	184212	184212	He	6366	" A crowd in fine clothes is of all mobs the dullest . I can look undismayed on the many - headed monster , wild and rampant ; but when the many - headed monster buys its hats in Bond Street , and has an eyeglass at each of its inquisitive eyes , I confess I take fright . Besides , it is near seven o'clock ; Putney not visible , and the flounders not fried ! "
184462	184555	184561	184561	Vance	425	" My cab is waiting yonder ; we must walk to it : we can keep on the turf , and avoid the throng . But tell me honestly , Vance , do you really dislike to mix in crowds ; you , with your fame , dislike the eyes that turn back to look again , and the lips that respectfully murmur , ' Vance the Painter ' ? Ah , I always said you would be a great painter , - and in five short years you have soared high . "
184556	184559	184561	184561	Vance	425	" Pooh ! "
184565	184669	184782	184782	Vance	425	" Nothing is pure and unadulterated in London use ; not cream , nor cayenne pepper ; least of all Fame , - mixed up with the most deleterious ingredients . Fame ! did you read the ' Times ' critique on my pictures in the present Exhibition ? Fame indeed Change the subject . Nothing so good as flounders . Ho ! is that your cab ? Superb ! Car fit for the ' Grecian youth of talents rare , ' in Mr. Enfield 's ' Speaker ; ' horse that seems conjured out of the Elgin Marbles . Is he quiet ? "
184670	184697	184731	184731	Lionel	419	" Not very ; but trust to my driving . You may well admire the horse , - present from Darrell , chosen by Colonel Morley . "
184726	184729	184731	184731	Lionel	419	" Frank , "
184742	184759	184792	184792	Lionel	419	" your cynical definitions are unworthy that masculine beard . You despise fame ! what sheer affectation !

184776	184780	184782	184782	Vance	425	" Take care , "
184784	184790	184828	184828	Lionel	419	" we shall be over . "
184821	184826	184828	184828	Lionel	419	" Fame , fame ! "
184834	184850	184869	184869	Vance	425	" What would I not give to have and to hold it for an hour ? "
184851	184867	184882	184882	he	425	" Hold an eel , less slippery ; a scorpion , less stinging ! But - "
184878	184881	184882	184882	he	425	" but , "
184892	185037	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" I forgot , you are a soldier , you follow the career of arms ! Never heed what is said on the subject by a querulous painter ! The desire of fame may be folly in civilians : in soldiers it is wisdom . Twin - born with the martial sense of honour , it cheers the march ; it warms the bivouac ; it gives music to the whir of the bullet , the roar of the ball ; it plants hope in the thick of peril ; knits rivals with the bond of brothers ; comforts the survivor when the brother falls ; takes from war its grim aspect of carnage ; and from homicide itself extracts lessons that strengthen the safeguards to humanity , and perpetuate life to nations . Right : pant for fame ; you are a soldier ! "
185107	185146	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" I suppose , during the five years you have spent abroad completing your general education , you have made little study , or none , of what specially appertains to the profession you have so recently chosen . "
185147	185332	185340	185340	Vance	425	" You are mistaken there , my dear Vance . If a man 's heart be set on a thing , he is always studying it . The books I loved best , and most pondered over , were such as , if they did not administer lessons , suggested hints that might turn to lessons hereafter . In social intercourse , I never was so pleased as when I could fasten myself to some practical veteran , - question and cross - examine him . One picks up more ideas in conversation than from books ; at least I do . Besides , my idea of a soldier who is to succeed some day is not that of a mere mechanician - at - arms . See how accomplished most great captains have been . What observers of mankind ! what diplomatists ! what reasoners ! what men of action , because men to whom reflection had been habitual before they acted ! How many stores of idea must have gone to the judgment which hazards the sortie or decides on the retreat ! "
185333	185338	185340	185340	Vance	425	" Gently , gently ! "
185342	185424	185430	185430	Lionel	419	" We shall be into that omnibus ! Give me the whip , - do ; there , a little more to the left , - so . Yes ; I am glad to see such enthusiasm in your profession : ' t is half the battle . Hazlitt said a capital thing , ' The ' prentice who does not consider the Lord Mayor in his gilt coach the greatest man in the world will live to be hanged ! ' "
185425	185428	185437	185437	VANCE	425	" Pish ! "
185443	185502	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" No . I apologize . I retract the Lord Mayor : comparisons are odious . I agree with you , nothing like leather . I mean nothing like a really great soldier , - Hannibal , and so forth . Cherish that conviction , my friend : meanwhile , respect human life ; there is another omnibus ! "
185522	185537	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" Mr. Darrell , of course , consents to your choice of a profession ? "
185538	185560	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" Consents ! approves , encourages . Wrote me such a beautiful letter ! what a comprehensive intelligence that man has ! "
185561	185575	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" Necessarily ; since he agrees with you . Where is he now ? "
185576	185605	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" I have no notion : it is some months since I heard from him . He was then at Malta , on his return from Asia Minor . "
185606	185626	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" So ! you have never seen him since he bade you farewell at his old Manor - house ? "
185627	185641	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" Never . He has not , I believe , been in England . "
185642	185655	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" Nor in Paris , where you seem to have chiefly resided . "
185656	185775	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" Nor in Paris . Ah , Vance , could I but be of some comfort to him . Now that I am older , I think I understand in him much that perplexed me as a boy when we parted . Darrell is one of those men who require a home . Between the great world and solitude , he needs the intermediate filling - up which the life domestic alone supplies : a wife to realize the sweet word helpmate ; children , with whose future he could knit his own toils and his ancestral remembrances . That intermediate space annihilated , the great world and the solitude are left , each frowning on the other . "
185776	185798	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" My dear Lionel , you must have lived with very clever people : you are talking far above your years . "
185799	185905	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" Am I ? True ; I have lived , if not with very clever people , with people far above my years . That is a secret I learned from Colonel Morley , to whom I must present you , - the subtlest intellect under the quietest manner . Once he said to me , ' Would you throughout life be up to the height of your century , - always in the prime of man 's reason , without crudeness and without decline , - live habitually while young with persons older , and when old with persons younger , than yourself . ' "
185906	185936	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" Shrewdly said indeed . I felicitate you on the evident result of the maxim . And so Darrell has no home , - no wife and no children ? "
185937	185962	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" He has long been a widower ; he lost his only son in boyhood , and his daughter - did you never hear ? "
185963	185968	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" No , what ? "
185969	185987	185086	185087	The artist	1502	" Married so ill - a runaway match - and died many years since , without issue . "
185988	186013	186019	186019	Lionel	419	" Poor man ! It was these afflictions , then , that soured his life , and made him the hermit or the wanderer ? "
186014	186017	186019	186019	Lionel	419	" There , "
186021	186168	186169	186169	VANCE	425	" I am puzzled ; for I find that , even after his son 's death and his daughter 's unhappy marriage and estrangement from him , he was still in Parliament and in full activity of career . But certainly he did not long keep it up . It might have been an effort to which , strong as he is , he felt himself unequal ; or , might he have known some fresh disappointment , some new sorrow , which the world never guesses ? What I have said as to his family afflictions the world knows . But I think he will marry again . That idea seemed strong in his own mind when we parted ; he brought it out bluntly , roughly . Colonel Morley is convinced that he will marry , if but for the sake of an heir . "
186172	186186	186187	186187	LIONEL	419	" And if so , my poor Lionel , you are ousted of - "
186192	186316	186317	186317	VANCE	425	" Hush ! Do not say , my dear Vance , do not you say - you ! - one of those low , mean things which , if said to me even by men for whom I have no esteem , make my ears tingle and my cheek blush . When I think of what Darrell has already done for me , - me who have no claim on him , - it seems to me as if I must hate the man who insinuates , ' Fear lest your benefactor find a smile at his own hearth , a child of his own blood ; for you may be richer at his death in proportion as his life is desolate . ' "
186320	186386	186387	186387	LIONEL	419	" You are a fine young fellow , and I beg your pardon . Take care of that milestone : thank you . But I suspect that at least two - thirds of those friendly hands that detained you on the way to me were stretched out less to Lionel Haughton , a subaltern in the Guards , than to Mr. Darrell 's heir presumptive . "
186390	186520	186749	186749	Vance	425	" That thought sometimes galls me , but it does me good ; for it goads on my desire to make myself some one whom the most worldly would not disdain to know for his own sake . Oh for active service ! Oh for a sharp campaign ! Oh for fair trial how far a man in earnest can grapple Fortune to his breast with his own strong hands ! You have done so , Vance ; you had but your genius and your painter 's brush . I have no genius ; but I have a resolve , and resolve is perhaps as sure of its ends as genius . Genius and Resolve have three grand elements in common , - Patience , Hope , and Concentration . "
186744	186747	186749	186749	Vance	425	" So ! "
186756	186840	186919	186919	Lionel	419	" I do n't know whether I have resolve or genius ; but certainly if I have made my way to some small reputation , patience , hope , and concentration of purpose must have the credit of it ; and prudence , too , which you have forgotten to name , and certainly do n't evince as a charioteer . I hope , my dear fellow , you are not extravagant ? No doubt , eh ? - why do you laugh ? "
186841	186856	186749	186749	Vance	425	" The question is so like you , Frank , - thrifty as ever . "
186857	186918	187036	187036	Lionel	419	" Do you think I could have painted with a calm mind if I knew that at my door there was a dun whom I could not pay ? Art needs serenity ; and if an artist begin his career with as few shirts to his back as I had , he must place economy amongst the rules of perspective . "
187029	187034	187036	187036	Lionel	419	" Here we are ! "

187101	187127	187128	187128	VANCE	425	" Ah , no ! And that innocent , charming child , whose portrait you took , - you have never heard of her since ? "
187131	187141	187142	187142	LIONEL	419	" Never ! How should I ? Have you ? "
187145	187201	187202	187202	VANCE	425	" Only what Darrell repeated to me . His lawyer had ascertained that she and her grandfather had gone to America . Darrell gently implied that , from what he learned of them , they scarcely merited the interest I felt in their fate . But we were not deceived , were we , Vance ? "
187204	187253	187254	187254	LIONEL	419	" No ; the little girl - what was her name ? Sukey ? Sally ? Sophy , true - Sophy had something about her extremely prepossessing , besides her pretty face ; and , in spite of that horrid cotton print , I shall never forget it . "
187256	187269	187270	187270	VANCE	425	" Her face ! Nor I. I see it still before me ! "
187272	187321	187322	187322	LIONEL	419	" Her cotton print ! I see it still before me ! But I must not be ungrateful . Would you believe it , - that little portrait , which cost me three pounds , has made , I do n't say my fortune , but my fashion ? "
187324	187335	187336	187336	VANCE	425	" How ! You had the heart to sell it ? "
187339	187569	187570	187570	LIONEL	419	" No ; I kept it as a study for young female heads - ' with variations , ' as they say in music . It was by my female heads that I became the fashion ; every order I have contains the condition , ' But be sure , one of your sweet female heads , Mr. Vance . ' My female heads are as necessary to my canvas as a white horse to Wouvermans ' . Well , that child , who cost me three pounds , is the original of them all . Commencing as a Titania , she has been in turns a ' Psyche , ' a ' Beatrice - Cenci , ' a ' Minna , ' ' A Portrait of a Nobleman 's Daughter , ' ' Burns 's Mary in Heaven , ' ' The Young Gleaner , ' and ' Sabrina Fair , ' in Milton 's ' Comus . ' I have led that child through all history , sacred and profane . I have painted her in all costumes her own cotton print excepted . My female heads are my glory ; even the ' Times ' critic allows that ! ' Mr. Vance , there , is inimitable ! a type of childlike grace peculiarly his own , ' etc . I 'll lend you the article . "
187573	187617	187618	187618	VANCE	443	" And shall we never again see the original darling Sophy ? You will laugh , Vance , but I have been heartproof against all young ladies . If ever I marry , my wife must have Sophy 's eyes ! In America ! "
187621	187673	187674	187674	LIONEL	419	" Let us hope by this time happily married to a Yankee ! Yankees marry girls in their teens , and do n't ask for dowries . Married to a Yankee ! not a doubt of it ! a Yankee who thaws , whittles , and keeps a ' store ' ! "
187677	187695	187696	187696	VANCE	443	" Monster ! Hold your tongue . A propos of marriage , why are you still single ? "
187699	187880	187696	187696	VANCE	443	" Because I have no wish to be doubled up ! Moreover , man is like a napkin , the more neatly the housewife doubles him , the more carefully she lays him on the shelf . Neither can a man once doubled know how often he may be doubled . Not only his wife folds him in two , but every child quarters him into a new double , till what was a wide and handsome substance , large enough for anything in reason , dwindles into a pitiful square that will not cover one platter , - all puckers and creases , smaller and smaller with every double , with every double a new crease . Then , my friend , comes the washing - bill ! and , besides all the hurts one receives in the mangle , consider the hourly wear and tear of the linen - press ! In short , Shakspeare vindicates the single life , and depicts the double in the famous line , which is no doubt intended to be allegorical of marriage ,

188204	188213	188215	188215	Lionel	419	" There is so much power in faith , "
188217	188327	188654	188654	Vance	425	" even when faith is applied but to things human and earthly , that let a man be but firmly persuaded that he is born to do , some day , what at the moment seems impossible , and it is fifty to one but what he does it before he dies . Surely , when you were a child at school , you felt convinced that there was something in your fate distinct from that of the other boys , whom the master might call quite as clever , - felt that faith in yourself which made you sure that you would be one day what you are . "
188328	188462	188215	188215	Lionel	419	" Well , I suppose so ; but vague aspirations and self - conceits must be bound together by some practical necessity - perhaps a very homely and a very vulgar one - or they scatter and evaporate . One would think that rich people in high life ought to do more than poor folks in humble life . More pains are taken with their education ; they have more leisure for following the bent of their genius : yet it is the poor folks , often half self - educated , and with pinched bellies , that do three - fourths of the world 's grand labour . Poverty is the keenest stimulant ; and poverty made me say , not ' I will do , ' but ' I must . ' "
188463	188473	188654	188654	Vance	425	" You knew real poverty in childhood , Frank ? "
188474	188627	188215	188215	Lionel	419	" Real poverty , covered over with sham affluence . My father was Genteel Poverty , and my mother was Poor Gentility . The sham affluence went when my father died . The real poverty then came out in all its ugliness . I was taken from a genteel school , at which , long afterwards , I genteelly paid the bills ; and I had to support my mother somehow or other , - somehow or other I succeeded . Alas , I fear not genteelly ! But before I lost her , which I did in a few years , she had some comforts which were not appearances ; and she kindly allowed , dear soul , that gentility and shams do not go well together . Oh , beware of debt , Lionello mio ; and never call that economy meanness which is but the safeguard from mean degradation . "
188628	188647	188654	188654	Vance	425	" I understand you at last , Vance ; shake hands : I know why you are saving . "
188648	188652	188723	188723	Vance	425	" Habit now , "
188664	188722	188749	188749	his	425	" But I remember so well when twopence was a sum to be respected that to this day I would rather put it by than spend it . All our ideas - like orange - plants - spread out in proportion to the size of the box which imprisons the roots . Then I had a sister . "
188755	188768	188749	188749	his	425	" I had a sister older than myself , handsome , gentle . "
188769	189009	189018	189018	Vance	425	" I was so proud of her ! Foolish girl ! my love was not enough for her . Foolish girl ! she could not wait to see what I might live to do for her . She married - oh ! so genteelly ! - a young man , very well born , who had wooed her before my father died . He had the villany to remain constant when she had not a farthing , and he was dependent on distant relations , and his own domains in Parnassus . The wretch was a poet ! So they married . They spent their honeymoon genteelly , I dare say . His relations cut him . Parnassus paid no rents . He went abroad . Such heart - rending letters from her . They were destitute . How I worked ! how I raged ! But how could I maintain her and her husband too , mere child that I was ? No matter . They are dead now , both ; all dead for whose sake I first ground colours and saved halfpence . And Frank Vance is a stingy , selfish bachelor . Never revive this dull subject again , or I shall borrow a crown from you and cut you dead . Waiter , ho ! - the bill . I 'll just go round to the stables , and see the horse put to . "
189021	189051	189057	189057	Lionel	419	" Set me down anywhere in Piccadilly ; I will walk home . You , I suppose , of course , are staying with your mother in Gloucester Place ? "
189052	189055	189057	189057	Lionel	419	" No , "
189062	189121	189018	189018	Vance	425	" Colonel Morley , who acts for me as if he were my guardian , took a lodging for me in Chesterfield Street , Mayfair . My hours , I fear , would ill suit my dear mother . Only in town two days ; and , thanks to Morley , my table is already covered with invitations . "
189122	189133	189057	189057	Lionel	419	" Yet you gave me one day , generous friend ! "
189134	189169	189018	189018	Vance	425	" You the second day , my mother the first . But there are three balls before me to - night . Come home with me , and smoke your cigar while I dress . "
189170	189187	189229	189229	Lionel	419	" No ; but I will at least light my cigar in your hall , prodigal ! "
189212	189228	189777	189777	he	512	" A note for you , sir , from Colonel Morley , - just come . "
189827	189870	190194	190194	his	512	" Lovers there had breathed their first vows ; bridal feasts had been held ; babes had crowed in the arms of proud young mothers ; politicians there had been raised into ministers ; ministers there had fallen back into independent members ; "
190208	190218	190339	190339	he	512	" I have done with the substances of life . "
190356	190363	190382	190384	The two Englishmen	6486	" Alban , my dear Alban ! "
190364	190381	190430	190430	he	628	" Darrell ! old friend ! old school - friend ! dear , dear Guy Darrell ! "
190440	190453	190430	190430	he	628	" So little change ! - wonderful ! What is your secret ? "
190454	190484	190430	190430	he	628	" Suspense from life , - hibernating . But you beat me ; you have been spending life , yet seem as rich in it as when we parted . "
190485	190596	190688	190689	Colonel Morley	628	" No ; I begin to decry the present and laud the past ; to read with glasses , to decide from prejudice , to recoil from change , to find sense in twaddle , to know the value of health from the fear to lose it ; to feel an interest in rheumatism , an awe of bronchitis ; to tell anecdotes , and to wear flannel . To you in strict confidence I disclose the truth : I am no longer twenty - five . You laugh ; this is civilized talk : does it not refresh you after the gibberish you must have chattered in Asia Minor ? "
190692	190713	190714	190714	DARRELL	512	" But when did you arrive ? whence ? How long do you stay here ? What are your plans ? "
190717	190753	190754	190755	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Caesar could not be more laconic . When arrived ? this evening . Whence ? Ouzelford . How long do I stay ? uncertain . What are my plans ? let us discuss them . "
190758	190781	190807	190807	he	512	" With all my heart . You have plans , then ? - a good sign . Animals in hibernation form none . "
190811	190993	190994	190995	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" For the last five years I have struggled hard to renew interest in mankind , reconnect myself with common life and its healthful objects . Between Fawley and London I desired to form a magnetic medium . I took rather a vast one , - nearly all the rest of the known world . I have visited both Americas , either end . All Asia have I ransacked , and pierced as far into Africa as traveller ever went in search of Timbuctoo . But I have sojourned also , at long intervals , at least they seemed long to me , - in the gay capitals of Europe Paris excepted ; mixed , too , with the gayest ; hired palaces , filled them with guests ; feasted and heard music . ' Guy Darrell , ' said I , ' shake off the rust of years : thou hadst no youth while young , - be young now . A holiday may restore thee to wholesome work , as a holiday restores the wearied school - boy . ' "
190998	191006	191007	191007	DARRELL	512	" I comprehend ; the experiment succeeded ? "
191010	191099	191100	191101	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" I do n't know : not yet ; but it may . I am here , and I intend to stay . I would not go to a hotel for a single day , lest my resolution should fail me . I have thrown myself into this castle of care without even a garrison . I hope to hold it . Help me to man it . In a word , and without metaphor , I am here with the design of re - entering London life . "
191104	191178	191336	191336	Darrell	512	" I am so glad . Hearty congratulations ! How rejoiced all the Viponts will be ! Another ' CRISIS ' is at hand . You have seen the newspapers regularly , of course : the state of the country interests you . You say that you come from Ouzelford , the town you once represented . I guess you will re - enter Parliament ; you have but to say the word . "
191182	191335	191336	191336	Darrell	512	" Parliament ! No . I received , while abroad , so earnest a request from my old constituents to lay the foundation - stone of a new Town - Hall , in which they are much interested ; and my obligations to them have been so great that I could not refuse . I wrote to fix the day as soon as I had resolved to return to England , making a condition that I should be spared the infliction of a public dinner , and landed just in time to keep my appointment ; reached Ouzelford early this morning , went through the ceremony , made a short speech , came on at once to London , not venturing to diverge to Fawley which is not very far from Ouzelford , lest , once there again , I should not have strength to leave it ; and here I am . "
191347	191460	191336	191336	Darrell	512	" Parliament ? No . Labour ? No . Fellow - man , I am about to confess to you : I would snatch back some days of youth , - a wintry likeness of youth , better than none . Old friend , let us amuse ourselves ! When I was working hard , hard , hard ! it was you who would say : ' Come forth , be amused , ' - you ! happy butterfly that you were ! Now , I say to you , ' Show me this flaunting town that you know so well ; initiate me into the joys of polite pleasures , social commune ,
191461	191469	191470	191470	You	6491	" ' Dulce mihi furere est amico . "
191481	191481	191491	191491	his	13877	"
191482	191485	191487	191488	the Colonel	13877	" Faith , "
191494	191564	191565	191565	DARRELL	512	" you come late in the day ! Amusements cease to amuse at last . I have tried all , and begin to be tired . I have had my holiday , exhausted its sports ; and you , coming from books and desk fresh into the playground , say , ' Football and leapfrog . ' Alas ! my poor friend , why did not you come sooner ? "
191568	191636	191470	191470	You	6491	" One word , one question . You have made EASE a philosophy and a system ; no man ever did so with more felicitous grace : nor , in following pleasure , have you parted company with conscience and shame . A fine gentleman ever , in honour as in elegance . Well , are you satisfied with your choice of life ? Are you happy ? "
191637	191647	191565	191565	DARRELL	512	" Happy ! who is ? Satisfied , perhaps . "
191648	191669	191470	191470	You	6491	" Is there any one you envy , - whose choice , other than your own , you would prefer ? "
191670	191673	191565	191565	DARRELL	512	" Certainly . "
191674	191677	191470	191470	You	6491	" Who ? "
191678	191681	191687	191687	Darrell	512	" You . "
191682	191685	191687	191687	Darrell	512	" I ! "
191696	191706	191707	191708	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" I ! envy me ! prefer my choice ! "
191712	191891	191892	191892	DARRELL	512	" Without doubt . You have had gratified ambition , a great career . Envy you ! who would not ? Your own objects in life fulfilled : you coveted distinction , - you won it ; fortune , - your wealth is immense ; the restoration of your name and lineage from obscurity and humiliation , - are not name and lineage again written in the Libro d'oro ? What king would not hail you as his counsellor ? What senate not open its ranks to admit you as a chief ? What house , though the haughtiest in the land , would not accept your alliance ? And withal , you stand before me stalwart and unbowed , young blood still in your veins . Ungrateful man , who would not change lots with Guy Darrell ? Fame , fortune , health , and , not to flatter you , a form and presence that would be remarked , though you stood in that black frock by the side of a monarch in his coronation robes . "
191895	191959	191960	191961	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" You have turned my question against myself with a kindliness of intention that makes me forgive your belief in my vanity . Pass on , - or rather pass back ; you say you have tried all in life that distracts or sweetens . Not so , lone bachelor ; you have not tried wedlock . Has not that been your mistake ? "
191964	191974	192031	192032	the friend	6493	" Answer for yourself . You have tried it . "
192024	192028	192034	192034	DARRELL	512	" Pardon me , "
192037	192149	192150	192151	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Oh , yes ! I brought it on myself . What stuff we have been talking ! Tell me the news , not political , any other . But first , your report of young Haughton . Cordial thanks for all your kindness to him . You write me word that he is much improved , - most likeable ; you add , that at Paris he became the rage , that in London you are sure he will be extremely popular . Be it so , if for his own sake . Are you quite sure that it is not for the expectations which I come here to disperse ? "
192154	192190	192197	192197	Darrell	512	" Much for himself , I am certain ; a little , perhaps , because - whatever he thinks , and I say to the contrary - people seeing no other heir to your property - "
192191	192195	192197	192197	Darrell	512	" I understand , "
192201	192216	192217	192218	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" But he does not nurse those expectations ? he will not be disappointed ? "
192221	192279	192280	192280	DARRELL	512	" Verily I believe that , apart from his love for you and a delicacy of sentiment that would recoil from planting hopes of wealth in the graves of benefactors , Lionel Haughton would prefer carving his own fortunes to all the ingots hewed out of California by another 's hand and bequeathed by another 's will . "
192283	192295	192296	192297	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" I am heartily glad to hear and to trust you . "
192300	192318	192325	192325	Darrell	512	" I gather from what you say that you are here with the intention to - to - "
192319	192323	192325	192325	Darrell	512	" Marry again , "
192329	192335	192296	192297	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Right . I am . "
192336	192352	192325	192325	Darrell	512	" I always felt sure you would marry again . Is the lady here too ? "
192353	192357	192296	192297	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" What lady ? "
192358	192365	192325	192325	Darrell	512	" The lady you have chosen . "
192366	192484	192520	192520	his	628	" Tush ! I have chosen none . I come here to choose ; and in this I ask advice from your experience . I would marry again ! I ! at my age ! Ridiculous ! But so it is . You know all the mothers and marriageable daughters that London - arida nutrix - rears for nuptial altars : where , amongst them , shall I , Guy Darrell , the man whom you think so enviable , find the safe helpmate , whose love he may reward with munificent jointure , to whose child he may bequeath the name that has now no successor , and the wealth he has no heart to spend ? "
192528	192566	192567	192567	DARRELL	512	" You would not marry a mere girl ? some one of suitable age . I know several most superior young women on the other side of thirty , Wilhelmina Prymme , for instance , or Janet - "
192570	192579	192580	192581	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Old maids . No ! decidedly no ! "
192585	192624	192625	192625	DARRELL	512	" But you would not risk the peace of your old age with a girl of eighteen , or else I do know a very accomplished , well - brought - up girl ; just eighteen , who - "
192628	192644	192645	192646	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Re - enter life by the side of Eighteen ! am I a madman ? "
192649	192691	192692	192692	DARRELL	512	" Neither old maids nor young maids ; the choice becomes narrowed . You would prefer a widow . Ha ! I have thought of one ; a prize , indeed , could you but win her , the widow of - "
192695	192718	192719	192719	MORLEY	628	" Ephesus ! - Bah ! suggest no widow to me . A widow , with her affections buried in the grave ! "
192722	192731	192732	192732	DARRELL	512	" Not necessarily . And in this case - "
192740	192825	192826	192827	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" In every case I tell you : no widow shall doff her weeds for me . Did she love the first man ? Fickle is the woman who can love twice . Did she not love him ? Why did she marry him ? Perhaps she sold herself to a rent - roll ? Shall she sell herself again to me for a jointure ? Heaven forbid ! Talk not of widows . No dainty so flavourless as a heart warmed up again . "
192830	192857	192858	192858	DARRELL	512	" Neither maids , be they old or young , nor widows . Possibly you want an angel . London is not the place for angels . "
192861	192940	192941	192942	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" I grant that the choice seems involved in perplexity . How can it be otherwise if one 's self is perplexed ? And yet , Alban , I am serious ; and I do not presume to be so exacting as my words have implied . I ask not fortune , nor rank beyond gentle blood , nor youth nor beauty nor accomplishments nor fashion , but I do ask one thing , and one thing only . "
192945	192961	192962	192962	DARRELL	512	" What is that ? you have left nothing worth the having to ask for . "
192965	193316	193317	193318	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Nothing ! I have left all ! I ask some one whom I can love ; love better than all the world , - not the mariage de convenance , not the mariage de raison , but the mariage d'amour . All other marriage , with vows of love so solemn , with intimacy of commune so close , - all other marriage , in my eyes , is an acted falsehood , a varnished sin . Ah , if I had thought so always ! But away regret and repentance ! The future alone is now before me ! Alban Morley ! I would sign away all I have in the world save the old house at Fawley , ay , and after signing , cut off to boot this right hand , could I but once fall in love ; love , and be loved again , as any two of Heaven 's simplest human creatures may love each other while life is fresh ! Strange ! strange ! look out into the world ; mark the man of our years who shall be most courted , most adulated , or admired . Give him all the attributes of power , wealth , royalty , genius , fame . See all the younger generation bow before him with hope or awe : his word can make their fortune ; at his smile a reputation dawns . Well ; now let that man say to the young , ' Room amongst yourselves : all that wins me this homage I would lay at the feet of Beauty . I enter the lists of love , ' and straightway his power vanishes , the poorest booby of twenty - four can jostle him aside ; before , the object of reverence , he is now the butt of ridicule . The instant he asks right to win the heart of a woman , a boy whom in all else he could rule as a lackey cries , ' Off , Graybeard , that realm at least is mine ! ' "
193321	193381	193382	193382	DARRELL	512	" This were but eloquent extravagance , even if your beard were gray . Men older than you , and with half your pretensions , even of outward form , have carried away hearts from boys like Adonis . Only choose well : that 's the difficulty ; if it was not difficult , who would be a bachelor ? "
193385	193396	193397	193398	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Guide my choice . Pilot me to the haven . "
193401	193464	193465	193465	DARRELL	512	" Accepted ! But you must remount a suitable establishment ; reopen your way to the great world , and penetrate those sacred recesses where awaiting spinsters weave the fatal web . Leave all to me . Let Mills I see you have him still call on me to - morrow about your menage . You will give dinners , of course ? "
193468	193481	193498	193498	Darrell	512	" Oh , of course ; must I dine at them myself ? "
193492	193496	193498	193498	Darrell	512	" So soon ! "
193500	193516	193498	193498	Darrell	512	" If I fatigue you already , what chance shall I have with new friends ? "
193517	193535	193498	193498	Darrell	512	" So soon ! it is past eleven . And it is you who must be fatigued . "
193536	193586	193599	193599	Alban	628	" No such good luck ; were I fatigued , I might hope to sleep . I will walk back with you . Leave me not alone in this room , - alone in the jaws of a fish ; swallowed up by a creature whose blood is cold . "
193587	193597	193599	193599	Alban	628	" You have something still to say to me , "
193609	193621	193498	193498	Darrell	512	" I detect it in your manner ; what is it ? "
193622	193657	193599	193599	Alban	628	" I know not . But you have told me no news ; these streets are grown strange to me . Who live now in yonder houses ? once the dwellers were my friends . "
193658	193706	193498	193498	Darrell	512	" In that house , - oh , new people ! I forget their names , - but rich ; in a year or two , with luck , they may be exclusives , and forget my name . In the other house , Carr Vipont still . "
193707	193743	193599	193599	Alban	628	" Vipont ; those dear Viponts ! what of them all ? Crawl they , sting they , bask they in the sun , or are they in anxious process of a change of skin ? "
193744	193787	193498	193498	Darrell	512	" Hush ! my dear friend : no satire on your own connections ; nothing so injudicious . I am a Vipont , too , and all for the family maxim , ' Vipont with Vipont , and come what may ! ' "
193788	193869	193870	193871	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" I stand rebuked . But I am no Vipont . I married , it is true , into their house , and they married , ages ago , into mine ; but no drop in the blood of time - servers flows through the veins of the last childless Darrell . Pardon . I allow the merit of the Vipont race ; no family more excites my respectful interest . What of their births , deaths , and marriages ? "
193874	194001	194002	194002	DARRELL	512	" As to the births , Carr has just welcomed the birth of a grandson ; the first - born of his eldest son who married last year a daughter of the Duke of Halifax , - a promising young man , a Lord in the Admiralty . Carr has a second son in the Hussars ; has just purchased his step : the other boys are still at school . He has three daughters too , fine girls , admirably brought up ; indeed , now I think of it , the eldest , Honoria , might suit you , highly accomplished ; well read ; interests herself in politics ; a great admirer of intellect ; of a very serious turn of mind too . "
194005	194039	194040	194041	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" A female politician with a serious turn of mind , - a farthing rushlight in a London fog ! Hasten on to subjects less gloomy . Whose funeral achievement is that yonder ? "
194044	194056	194057	194057	DARRELL	512	" The late Lord Niton 's , father to Lady Montfort . "
194060	194099	194100	194101	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Lady Montfort ! Her father was a Lyndsay , and died before the Flood . A deluge , at least , has gone over me and my world since I looked on the face of his widow . "
194104	194156	194167	194167	Darrell	512	" I speak of the present Lord Montfort 's wife , - the Earl 's . You of the poor Marquess 's , the last Marquess ; the marquisate is extinct . Surely , whatever your wanderings , you must have heard of the death of the last Marquess of Montfort ? "
194157	194165	194167	194167	Darrell	512	" Yes , I heard of that , "
194177	194191	194192	194193	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" So he is dead , the young man ! What killed him ? "
194196	194248	194249	194249	DARRELL	512	" A violent attack of croup , - quite sudden . He was staying at Carr 's at the time . I suspect that Carr made him talk ! a thing he was not accustomed to do . Deranged his system altogether . But do n't let us revive painful subjects . "
194252	194261	194262	194263	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Was she with him at the time ? "
194266	194278	194279	194279	DARRELL	512	" Lady Montfort ? No ; they were very seldom together . "
194282	194290	194291	194292	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" She is not married again yet ? "
194295	194362	194363	194363	DARRELL	512	" No , but still young and so beautiful she will have many offers . I know those who are waiting to propose . Montfort has been only dead eighteen months ; died just before young Carr 's marriage . His widow lives , in complete seclusion , at her jointure - house near Twickenham . She has only seen even me once since her loss . "
194366	194371	194372	194372	MORLEY	628	" When was that ? "
194375	194391	194392	194392	DARRELL	512	" About six or seven months ago ; she asked after you with much interest . "
194395	194399	194400	194401	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" After me ! "
194404	194449	194450	194450	DARRELL	512	" To be sure . Do n't I remember how constantly she and her mother were at your house ? Is it strange that she should ask after you ? You ought to know her better , - the most affectionate , grateful character . "
194453	194498	194499	194500	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" I dare say . But at the time you refer to , I was too occupied to acquire much accurate knowledge of a young lady 's character . I should have known her mother 's character better , yet I mistook even that . "
194503	194548	194549	194549	DARRELL	512	" Mrs. Lyndsay 's character you might well mistake , - charming but artificial : Lady Montfort is natural . Indeed , if you had not that illiberal prejudice against widows , she was the very person I was about to suggest to you . "
194552	194626	194627	194628	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" A fashionable beauty ! and young enough to be my daughter . Such is human friendship ! So the marquisate is extinct , and Sir James Vipont , whom I remember in the House of Commons - respectable man , great authority on cattle , timid , and always saying , ' Did you read that article in to - day 's paper ? ' - has the estates and the earldom ? "
194631	194921	195005	195005	Vipont	628	" Yes . There was some fear of a disputed succession , but Sir James made his claim very clear . Between you and me , the change has been a serious affliction to the Viponts . The late lord was not wise , but on state occasions he looked his part , - tres grand seigneur , - and Carr managed the family influence with admirable tact . The present lord has the habits of a yeoman ; his wife shares his tastes . He has taken the management not only of the property , but of its influence , out of Carr 's hands , and will make a sad mess of it , for he is an impracticable , obsolete politician . He will never keep the family together , impossible , a sad thing . I remember how our last muster , five years ago next Christmas , struck terror into Lord 's Cabinet ; the mere report of it in the newspapers set all people talking and thinking . The result was that , two weeks after , proper overtures were made to Carr : he consented to assist the ministers ; and the country was saved ! Now , thanks to this stupid new earl , in eighteen months we have lost ground which it took at least a century and a half to gain . Our votes are divided ; our influence frittered away ; Montfort House is shut up ; and Carr , grown quite thin , says that in the coming ' CRISIS ' a Cabinet will not only be formed , but will also last - last time enough for irreparable mischief - without a single Vipont in office . "
195013	195162	195005	195005	Vipont	628	" Your appearance in town , my dear Darrell , is most opportune . It will be an object with the whole family to make the most of you at this coming ' CRISIS ; ' I say coming , for I believe it must come . Your name is still freshly remembered ; your position greater for having been out of all the scrapes of the party the last sixteen or seventeen years : your house should be the nucleus of new combinations . Do n't forget to send Mills to me ; I will engage your chef and your house - steward to - morrow . I know just the men to suit you . Your intention to marry too , just at this moment , is most seasonable ; it will increase the family interest . I may give out that you intend to marry ? "
195163	195173	195005	195005	Vipont	628	" Oh , certainly cry it at Charing Cross . "
195174	195228	195005	195005	Vipont	628	" A club - room will do as well . I beg ten thousand pardons ; but people will talk about money whenever they talk about marriage . I should not like to exaggerate your fortune : I know it must be very large , and all at your own disposal , eh ? "
195229	195233	195005	195005	Vipont	628	" Every shilling . "
195234	195249	195005	195005	Vipont	628	" You must have saved a great deal since you retired into private life ? "
195250	195338	195005	195005	Vipont	628	" Take that for granted . Dick Fairthorn receives my rents , and looks to my various investments ; and I accept him as an indisputable authority when I say that , what with the rental of lands I purchased in my poor boy 's lifetime and the interest on my much more lucrative moneyed capital , you may safely whisper to all ladies likely to feel interest in that diffusion of knowledge , ' Thirty - five thousand a year , and an old fool . ' "
195339	195375	195385	195385	Darrell	512	" I certainly shall not say an old fool , for I am the same age as yourself ; and if I had thirty - five thousand pounds a year , I would marry too . "
195376	195383	195613	195613	he	512	" You would ! Old fool ! "
195658	195671	196117	196117	her	6534	" Ah , who can tell how hard it is to climb ! "

Have I no other hold over him ? Can I send Dolly Poole to him ? How addled my brains are ! - want of food , want of sleep . Is this the place ? Peuh ! - "

Let me in ; knock up somebody , break open the larder . I want to eat , I am famished ; I should have eaten you by this time , only there 's nothing on your bones . "

200578	200602	201037	201039	The little man	6695	" ' tis a bad trade ; every year it gets worse . Or have you not some higher game in your eye ? "
200603	200645	200576	200576	Cutts	954	" I have higher game in my eye . One bird I marked down this very night . But that may be slow work , and uncertain . I have in this pocket - book a bank to draw upon meanwhile . "
200646	200657	201037	201039	The little man	6695	" How ? forged French billets de banque ? dangerous . "
200658	200676	200576	200576	Cutts	954	" Pooh ! better than that , - letters which prove theft against a respectable rich man . "
200677	200686	201037	201039	The little man	6695	" Ah , you expect hush - money ? "
200687	200698	200576	200576	Cutts	954	" Exactly so . I have good friends in London . "
200699	200722	201037	201039	The little man	6695	" Among them , I suppose , that affectionate ' adopted mother , ' who would have kept you in such order . "
200723	200853	200576	200576	Cutts	954	" Thousand thunders ! I hope not . I am not a superstitious man , but I fear that woman as if she were a witch , and I believe she is one . You remember black Jean , whom we call Sansculotte . He would have filled a churchyard with his own brats for a five - franc piece ; but he would not have crossed a churchyard alone at night for a thousand naps . Well , that woman to me is what a churchyard was to black Jean . No : if she is in London , I have but to go to her house and say , ' Food , shelter , money ; ' and I would rather ask Jack Ketch for a rope . "
200854	200910	201037	201039	The little man	6695	" How do you account for it , General ? She does not beat you ; she is not your wife . I have seen many a stout fellow , who would stand fire without blinking , show the white feather at a scold 's tongue . But then he must be spliced to her - "
200911	201036	201072	201072	he	6695	" Cutts , that Griffin does not scold : she preaches . She wants to make me spoony , Cutts : she talks of my young days , Cutts ; she wants to blight me into what she calls an honest man , Cutts , - the virtuous dodge ! She snubs and cows me , and frightens me out of my wits , Cutts ; for I do believe that the witch is determined to have me , body and soul , and to marry me some day in spite of myself , Cutts ; and if ever you see me about to be clutched in those horrible paws , poison me with ratsbane , or knock me on the head , Cutts . "
201068	201071	201072	201072	he	6695	" Hush ! "
201076	201104	201187	201187	he	6695	" and let me have a bed , if you can ; I have not slept in one for a week , and my nerves are shaky . "

205273	205288	205350	205352	Honoria Carr Vipont	897	" You can not make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear . "
205345	205348	205350	205352	Honoria Carr Vipont	897	" Mamma , "
205354	205364	205378	205379	Lady Selina	500	" what sort of a person was Mrs. Darrell ? "
205365	205376	205454	205455	Lady Selina	500	" She was not in our set , my dear , "
205381	205452	205454	205455	Lady Selina	500	" The Vipont Crookes are just one of those connections with which , though of course one is civil to all connections , one is more or less intimate according as they take after the Viponts or after the Crookes . Poor woman ! she died just before Mr. Darrell entered Parliament and appeared in society . But I should say she was not an agreeable person . Not nice , "
205472	205483	205454	205455	Lady Selina	500	" I suppose she was very accomplished , very clever ? "
205484	205516	205454	205455	Lady Selina	500	" Quite the reverse , my dear . Mr. Darrell was exceedingly young when he married , scarcely of age . She was not the sort of woman to suit him . "
205517	205536	205583	205584	Lady Selina	500	" But at least she must have been very much attached to him , very proud of him ? "
205575	205581	205583	205584	Lady Selina	500	" I do n't think , "
205586	205978	205990	205990	Honoria	897	" that she was proud of him . She would have been proud of his station , or rather of that to which his fame and fortune would have raised her , had she lived to enjoy it . But for a few years after her marriage they were very poor ; and though his rise at the bar was sudden and brilliant , he was long wholly absorbed in his profession , and lived in Bloomsbury . Mrs. Darrell was not proud of that . The Crookes are generally fine , give themselves airs , marry into great houses if they can : but we ca n't naturalize them ; they always remain Crookes , - useful connections , very ! Carr says we have not a more useful , - but third - rate , my dear . All the Crookes are bad wives , because they are never satisfied with their own homes , but are always trying to get into great people 's homes . Not very long before she died , Mrs. Darrell took her friend and relation , Mrs. Lyndsay , to live with her . I suspect it was not from affection , or any great consideration for Mrs. Lyndsay 's circumstances which were indeed those of actual destitution , till - thanks to Mr. Darrell - she won her lawsuit , but simply because she looked to Mrs. Lyndsay to get her into our set . Mrs. Lyndsay was a great favourite with all of us , charming manners , - perfectly correct , too , - thorough Vipont , thorough gentlewoman , but artful ! Oh , so artful ! She humoured poor Mrs. Darrell 's absurd vanity ; but she took care not to injure herself . Of course , Darrell 's wife , and a Vipont - though only a Vipont Crooke - had free passport into the outskirts of good society , the great parties , and so forth . But there it stopped ; even I should have been compromised if I had admitted into our set a woman who was bent on compromising herself . Handsome , in a bad style , not the Vipont tournure ; and not only silly and flirting , but we are alone , keep the secret decidedly vulgar , my dear . "
205979	205989	206005	206006	Lady Selina	500	" You amaze me ! How such a man - "
205999	206003	206005	206006	Lady Selina	500	" Clever men , "
206008	206336	206356	206356	Carr	897	" as a general rule , do choose the oddest wives ! The cleverer a man is , the more easily , I do believe , a woman can take him in . However , to do Mr. Darrell justice , he has been taken in only once . After Mrs. Darrell 's death , Mrs. Lyndsay , I suspect , tried her chance , but failed . Of course , she would not actually stay in the same house with a widower who was then young , and who had only to get rid of a wife to whom one was forced to be shy in order to be received into our set with open arms , and , in short , to be of the very best monde . Mr. Darrell came into Parliament immensely rich a legacy from an old East Indian , besides his own professional savings ; took the house he has now , close by us . Mrs. Lyndsay was obliged to retire to a cottage at Fulham . But as she professed to be a second mother to poor Matilda Darrell , she contrived to be very much at Carlton Gardens ; her daughter Caroline was nearly always there , profiting by Matilda 's masters ; and I did think that Mrs. Lyndsay would have caught Darrell , but your papa said ' No , ' and he was right , as he always is . Nevertheless , Mrs. Lyndsay would have been an excellent wife to a public man : so popular ; knew the world so well ; never made enemies till she made an enemy of poor dear Montfort , but that was natural . By the by , I must write to Caroline . Sweet creature ! but how absurd , shutting herself up as if she were fretting for Montfort ! That 's so like her mother , - heartless , but full of propriety . "
206347	206354	206356	206356	Carr	897	" We have just left Darrell , "
206358	206403	206412	206413	the Colonel	13877	" he will dine here to - day , to meet our cousin Alban . I have asked his cousin , young Haughton , and - and , your cousins , Selina a small party of cousins ; so lucky to find Darrell disengaged . "
206404	206410	206412	206413	the Colonel	13877	" I ventured to promise , "
206422	206431	206432	206432	HONORIA	897	" that Darrell should hear you play Beethoven . "
206435	206446	206447	206448	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Is Mr. Darrell so fond of music , then ? "
206451	206567	206573	206574	Lady Selina	500	" One would not have thought it . He keeps a secretary at Fawley who plays the flute . There 's something very interesting about Darrell . I wish you could hear his ideas on marriage and domestic life : more freshness of heart than in the young men one meets nowadays . It may be prejudice ; but it seems to me that the young fellows of the present race , if more sober and staid than we were , are sadly wanting in character and spirit , - no warm blood in their veins . But I should not talk thus to a demoiselle who has all those young fellows at her feet . "
206568	206571	206573	206574	Lady Selina	500	" Oh , "
206584	206611	206620	206620	Honoria	897	" Honoria thinks much as you do : she finds the young men so insipid ; all like one another , - the same set phrases . "
206612	206618	206640	206641	the Colonel	13877	" The same stereotyped ideas , "
206631	206638	206640	206641	the Colonel	13877	" A very superior mind hers , "

I have it from Alban Morley : immense fortune ; and so young - looking , any girl might fall in love with such eyes and forehead ; besides , what a jointure he could settle ! ... Do look at that girl , Flora Vyvyan , trying to make a fool of him . She ca n't appreciate that kind of man , and she would not be caught by his money ; does not want it .... I wonder she is not afraid of him . He is certainly quizzing her .... The men think her pretty ; I do n't .... They say he is to return to Parliament , and have a place in the Cabinet . ... No ! he has no children living : very natural he should marry again . ... A nephew ! - you are quite mistaken . Young Haughton is no nephew : a very distant connection ; could not expect to be the heir .... It was given out , though , at Paris . The Duchess thought so , and so did Lady Jane .

208403	208441	208442	208442	LIONEL	419	" Give me your arm , my dear Lionel ; I am tired out . What a lovely night ! What sweet scorn in the eyes of those stars that we have neglected for yon flaring lights . "
208445	208460	208461	208461	DARRELL	512	" Is it scorn ? is it pity ? is it but serene indifference ? "
208464	208548	208442	208442	LIONEL	419	" As we ourselves interpret : if scorn be present in our own hearts , it will be seen in the disc of Jupiter . Man , egotist though he be , exacts sympathy from all the universe . Joyous , he says to the sun , ' Life - giver , rejoice with me . ' Grieving , he says to the moon , ' Pensive one , thou sharest my sorrow . ' Hope for fame ; a star is its promise !
208549	208830	208943	208949	any one with nerves alive to music	6930	" Mourn for the dead ; a star is the land of reunion ! Say to earth , ' I have done with thee ; ' to Time , ' Thou hast nought to bestow ; ' and all space cries aloud , ' The earth is a speck , thine inheritance infinity . Time melts while thou sighest . The discontent of a mortal is the instinct that proves thee immortal . ' Thus construing Nature , Nature is our companion , our consoler . Benign as the playmate , she lends herself to our shifting humours . Serious as the teacher , she responds to the steadier inquiries of reason . Mystic and hallowed as the priestess , she keeps alive by dim oracles that spiritual yearning within us , in which , from savage to sage , - through all dreams , through all creeds , - thrills the sense of a link with Divinity . Never , therefore , while conferring with Nature , is Man wholly alone , nor is she a single companion with uniform shape . Ever new , ever various , she can pass from gay to severe , from fancy to science , - quick as thought passes from the dance of a leaf , from the tint of a rainbow , to the theory of motion , the problem of light . But lose Nature , forget or dismiss her , make companions , by hundreds , of men who ignore her , and I will not say with the poet , ' This is solitude . ' But in the commune , what stale monotony , what weary sameness ! "
208954	208959	209052	209052	Darrell	512	" Talk on forever . "
209064	209087	209745	209745	Darrell	512	" No , not yet ; I have something to say to you : come in ; let me say it now . "
209156	209744	210372	210372	Darrell	512	" Lionel , before I was your age I was married ; I was a father . I am lonely and childless now . My life has been moulded by a solemn obligation which so few could comprehend that I scarce know a man living beside yourself to whom I would frankly confide it . Pride of family is a common infirmity , - often petulant with the poor , often insolent with the rich ; but rarely , perhaps , out of that pride do men construct a positive binding duty , which at all self - sacrifice should influence the practical choice of life . As a child , before my judgment could discern how much of vain superstition may lurk in our reverence for the dead , my whole heart was engaged in a passionate dream , which my waking existence became vowed to realize . My father ! - my lip quivers , my eyes moisten as I recall him , even now , - my father ! - I loved him so intensely ! - the love of childhood , how fearfully strong it is ! All in him was so gentle , yet so sensitive , - chivalry without its armour . I was his constant companion : he spoke to me unreservedly , as a poet to his muse . I wept at his sorrows ; I chafed at his humiliations . He talked of ancestors as he thought of them ; to him they were beings like the old Lares , - not dead in graves , but images ever present on household hearths . Doubtless he exaggerated their worth , as their old importance . Obscure , indeed , in the annals of empire , their deeds and their power , their decline and fall . Not so thought he ; they were to his eyes the moon - track in the ocean of history , - light on the waves over which they had gleamed , - all the ocean elsewhere dark ! With him thought I ; as my father spoke , his child believed . But what to the eyes of the world was this inheritor of a vaunted name ? - a threadbare , slighted , rustic pedant ; no station in the very province in which mouldered away the last lowly dwelling - place of his line , - by lineage high above most nobles , in position below most yeomen . He had learning ; he had genius : but the studies to which they were devoted only served yet more to impoverish his scanty means , and led rather to ridicule than to honour . Not a day but what I saw on his soft features the smart of a fresh sting , the gnawing of a new care . Thus , as a boy , feeling in myself a strength inspired by affection , I came to him one day as he sat grieving , and kneeling to him , said , ' Father , courage yet a little while ; I shall soon be a man , and I swear to devote myself as man to revive the old fading race so prized by you ; to rebuild the House that , by you so loved , is loftier in my eyes than all the heraldry of kings . ' And my father 's face brightened , and his voice blessed me ; and I rose up - ambitious ! "
209760	210370	210372	210372	Darrell	512	" I was fortunate at the University . That was a day when chiefs of party looked for recruits amongst young men who had given the proofs and won the first - fruits of emulation and assiduity ; for statesmanship then was deemed an art which , like that of war , needs early discipline . I had scarcely left college when I was offered a seat in Parliament by the head of the Viponts , an old Lord Montfort . I was dazzled but for one moment ; I declined the next . The fallen House of Darrell needed wealth ; and Parliamentary success , in its higher honours , often requires wealth , - never gives it . It chanced that I had a college acquaintance with a young man named Vipont Crooke . His grandfather , one of the numberless Viponts , had been compelled to add the name of Crooke to his own , on succeeding to the property of some rich uncle , who was one of the numberless Crookes . I went with this college acquaintance to visit the old Lord Montfort , at his villa near London , and thence to the country - house of the Vipont Crookes . I stayed at the last two or three weeks . While there , I received a letter from the elder Fairthorn , my father 's bailiff , entreating me to come immediately to Fawley , hinting at some great calamity . On taking leave of my friend and his family , something in the manner of his sister startled and pained me , - an evident confusion , a burst of tears , - I know not what . I had never sought to win her affections . I had an ideal of the woman I could love , - it did not resemble her . On reaching Fawley , conceive the shock that awaited me . My father was like one heart - stricken . The principal mortgagee was about to foreclose , - Fawley about to pass forever from the race of the Darrells . I saw that the day my father was driven from the old house would be his last on earth . What means to save him ? - how raise the pitiful sum - but a few thousands - by which to release from the spoiler 's gripe those barren acres which all the lands of the Seymour or the Gower could never replace in my poor father 's eyes ? My sole income was a college fellowship , adequate to all my wants , but useless for sale or loan . I spent the night in vain consultation with Fairthorn . There seemed not a hope . Next morning came a letter from young Vipont Crooke . It was manly and frank , though somewhat coarse . With the consent of his parents he offered me his sister 's hand , and a dowry of L10,000 . He hinted , in excuse for his bluntness , that , perhaps from motives of delicacy , if I felt a preference for his sister , I might not deem myself rich enough to propose , and - but it matters not what else he said . You foresee the rest . My father 's life could be saved from despair ; his beloved home be his shelter to the last . That dowry would more than cover the paltry debt upon the lands . I gave myself not an hour to pause . I hastened back to the house to which fate had led me . But , "
210376	210451	210541	210541	Darrell	512	" do not think I was base enough , even with such excuses , to deceive the young lady . I told her what was true ; that I could not profess to her the love painted by romance - writers and poets ; but that I loved no other , and that if she deigned to accept my hand , I should studiously consult her happiness and gratefully confide to her my own . "
210452	210540	210541	210541	Darrell	512	" I said also , what was true , that if she married me , ours must be for some years a life of privation and struggle ; that even the interest of her fortune must be devoted to my father while he lived , though every shilling of its capital would be settled on herself and her children . How I blessed her when she accepted me , despite my candour ! - how earnestly I prayed that I might love and cherish and requite her ! "
210548	210867	210889	210889	Lionel	419	" And , thank Heaven ! I have nothing on that score wherewith to reproach myself ; and the strength of that memory enabled me to bear and forbear more than otherwise would have been possible to my quick spirit and my man 's heart . My dear father ! his death was happy : his home was saved ; he never knew at what sacrifice to his son ! He was gladdened by the first honours my youth achieved . He was resigned to my choice of a profession , which , though contrary to his antique prejudices , that allowed to the representative of the Darrells no profession but the sword , still promised the wealth which would secure his name from perishing . He was credulous of my future , as if I had uttered not a vow , but a prediction . He had blessed my union , without foreseeing its sorrows . He had embraced my first - born , - true , it was a girl , but it was one link onward from ancestors to posterity . And almost his last words were these : ' You will restore the race ; you will revive the name ! and my son 's children will visit the antiquary 's grave , and learn gratitude to him for all that his idle lessons taught to your healthier vigour . ' And I answered , ' Father , your line shall not perish from the land ; and when I am rich and great , and lordships spread far round the lowly hall that your life ennobled , I will say to your grandchildren , ' Honour ye and your son 's sons , while a Darrell yet treads the earth , honour him to whom I owe every thought which nerved me to toil for what you who come after me may enjoy . '
210868	210885	211215	211215	Darrell	512	" And so the old man , whose life had been so smileless , died smiling . "
210943	211213	211215	211215	Darrell	512	" I made , then , a promise ; it is not kept . No child of mine survives to be taught reverence to my father 's grave . My wedded life was not happy : its record needs no words . Of two children born to me , both are gone . My son went first . I had thrown my life 's life into him , - a boy of energy , of noble promise . ' T was for him I began to build that baffled fabric , ' Sepulchri immemor . ' For him I bought , acre on acre , all the land within reach of Fawley,-lands twelve miles distant . I had meant to fill up the intervening space , to buy out a mushroom earl whose woods and cornfields lie between . I was scheming the purchase , scrawling on the county map , when they brought the news that the boy I had just taken back to school was dead , - drowned bathing on a calm summer eve . No , Lionel . I must go on . That grief I have wrestled with , - conquered . I was widowed then . A daughter still left , - the first - born , whom my father had blest on his death - bed . I transferred all my love , all my hopes , to her . I had no vain preference for male heirs . Is a race less pure that runs on through the female line ? Well , my son 's death was merciful compared to - "
211222	211422	211438	211438	his	512	" Enough ! all is forgiven in the grave ! I was then still in the noon of man 's life , free to form new ties . Another grief that I can not tell you ; it is not all conquered yet . And by that grief the last verdure of existence was so blighted that - that - in short , I had no heart for nuptial altars , for the social world . Years went by . Each year I said , ' Next year the wound will be healed ; I have time yet . ' Now age is near , the grave not far ; now , if ever , I must fulfil the promise that cheered my father 's death - bed . Nor does that duty comprise all my motives . If I would regain healthful thought , manly action , for my remaining years , I must feel that one haunting memory is exorcised and forever laid at rest . It can be so only , - whatever my risk of new cares , whatever the folly of the hazard at my age , - be so only by - by - "
211444	211493	211927	211927	DARRELL	512	" Forgive me , my noble Lionel , that I am not contented with an heir like you ; and do not you mock at the old man who dreams that woman may love him yet , and that his own children may inherit his father 's home . "
211619	211637	211648	211649	the Colonel	13877	" I quite agree with you , Alban ; Honoria Vipont is a very superior young lady . "
211638	211646	211666	211666	Darrell	512	" I knew you would think so ! "
211659	211664	211666	211666	Darrell	512	" Many years since , "
211672	211784	211648	211649	the Colonel	13877	" I read Miss Edgeworth 's novels ; and in conversing with Miss Honoria Vipont , methinks I confer with one of Miss Edgeworth 's heroines - so rational , so prudent , so well - behaved - so free from silly romantic notions - so replete with solid information , moral philosophy and natural history - so sure to regulate her watch and her heart to the precise moment , for the one to strike , and the other to throb - and to marry at last a respectable steady husband , whom she will win with dignity , and would lose with decorum ! A very superior girl indeed . "
211785	211843	211856	211857	Alban Morley	628	" Darrell speaks - not the author . Darrell is unjust to the more exquisite female characters of a Novelist , admirable for strength of sense , correctness of delineation , terseness of narrative , and lucidity of style - nor less admirable for the unexaggerated nobleness of sentiment by which some of her heroines are notably distinguished .
211844	211854	211923	211924	the Colonel	13877	" Though your description of Miss Vipont is satirical , "
211867	211921	211927	211927	DARRELL	512	" yet I will accept it as panegyric ; for it conveys , unintentionally , a just idea of the qualities that make an intelligent companion and a safe wife . And those are the qualities we must look to , if we marry at our age . We are no longer boys , "
211930	211982	212066	212067	the Colonel	13877	" Alas , no ! I wish we were . But the truth of your remark is indisputable . Ah , look ! Is not that a face which might make an octogenarian forget that he is not a boy ? - what regular features ! - and what a blush ! "
212050	212064	212066	212067	the Colonel	13877	" Yes ; Lady Adela is one of the loveliest girls in London , "
212081	212197	212210	212210	Darrell	512	" and amiable too : I have known her ever since she was born . Her father and I are great friends - an excellent man but stingy . I had much difficulty in arranging the eldest girl 's marriage with Lord Bolton , and am a trustee in the settlement . If you feel a preference for Lady Adela , though I do n't think she would suit you so well as Miss Vipont , I will answer for her father 's encouragement and her consent . ' Tis no drawback to you , though it is to most of her admirers , when I add , ' There 's nothing with her ! ' "
212198	212208	212066	212067	the Colonel	13877	" And nothing in her ! which is worse , "
212212	212232	212233	212234	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Still , it is pleasant to gaze on a beautiful landscape , even though the soil be barren . "
212237	212260	212266	212266	Darrell	512	" That depends upon whether you are merely the artistic spectator of the landscape , or the disappointed proprietor of the soil . "
212261	212264	212266	212266	Darrell	512	" Admirable ! "
212268	212282	212773	212773	he	871	" you have disposed of Lady Adela . So ho ! so ho ! "
212780	212786	212773	212773	he	871	" There is my hand ; "
212793	212807	213226	213226	her	12548	" I know thee not , old roan ; Fall to thy prayers ! "
212972	213219	213232	213233	the Colonel	13877	" by advertising their horror of cigars . You would suppose that Flora Vyvyan must be coarse - vulgar perhaps ; not at all ; she was pignaute - original ; and did the oddest things with the air and look of the highest breeding . Fairies can not be vulgar , no matter what they do ; they may take the strangest liberties - pinch the maids - turn the house topsy - turvy ; but they are ever the darlings of grace and poetry . Flora Vyvyan was a fairy . Not peculiarly intellectual herself , she had a veneration for intellect ; those fast young men were the last persons likely to fascinate that fast young lady . Women are so perverse ; they always prefer the very people you would least suspect - the antithesis to themselves . Yet is it possible that Flora Vyvyan can have carried her crotchets to so extravagant a degree as to have designed the conquest of Guy Darrell - ten years older than her own father ? She , too , an heiress - certainly not mercenary ; she who had already refused better worldly matches than Darrell himself was - young men , handsome men , with coronets on the margin of their note - paper and the panels of their broughams ! The idea seemed preposterous ; nevertheless , Alban Morley , a shrewd observer , conceived that idea , and trembled for his friend .
213237	213244	213232	213233	the Colonel	13877	" Miss Vyvyan is - alarming . "
213248	213256	213257	213258	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Alarming ! the epithet requires construing . "
213261	213281	213282	213282	DARRELL	512	" The sort of girl who might make a man of our years really and literally an old fool ! "
213285	213357	213358	213359	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Old fool such a man must be if girls of any sort are permitted to make him a greater fool than he was before . But I think that , with those pretty hands resting on one 's arm - chair , or that sunny face shining into one 's study windows , one might be a very happy old fool - and that is the most one can expect ! "
213366	213421	213429	213429	Darrell	512	" I am afraid , my poor friend , you are far gone already . No wonder Honoria Vipont fails to be appreciated . But Lady Selina has a maxim - the truth of which my experience attests - ' the moment it comes to woman , the most sensible men are the ' - "
213422	213426	213429	213429	Darrell	512	" Oldest fools ! "
213431	213537	213543	213544	Alban Morley	628	" If Mark Antony made such a goose of himself for that painted harridan Cleopatra , what would he have done for a blooming Juliet ! Youth and high spirit ! Alas ! why are these to be unsuitable companions for us , as we reach that climax in time and sorrow - when to the one we are grown the most indulgent , and of the other have the most need ? Alban , that girl , if her heart were really won - her wild nature wisely mastered , gently guided - would make a true , prudent , loving , admirable wife - "
213538	213541	213554	213554	Darrell	512	" Heavens ! "
213546	213552	213554	213554	Darrell	512	" To such a husband , "
213560	213570	213429	213429	Darrell	512	" as - Lionel Haughton . What say you ? "
213571	213622	213554	213554	Darrell	512	" Lionel - oh , I have no objection at all to that ; but he 's too young yet to think of marriage - a mere boy . Besides , if you yourself marry , Lionel could scarcely aspire to a girl of Miss Vyvyan 's birth and fortune . "
213623	213724	213725	213725	MORLEY	628	" Ho , not aspire ! That boy at least shall not have to woo in vain from the want of fortune . The day I marry - if ever that day come - I settle on Lionel Haughton and his heirs five thousand a - year ; and if , with gentle blood , youth , good looks , and a heart of gold , that fortune does not allow him to aspire to any girl whose hand he covets , I can double it , and still be rich enough to buy a superior companion in Honoria Vipont - "
213728	213734	213735	213735	DARRELL	512	" Do n't say buy - "
213738	213947	213960	213961	the Colonel	13877	" Ay , and still be young enough to catch a butterfly in Lady Adela - still be bold enough to chain a panther in Flora Vyvyan . Let the world know - your world in each nook of its gaudy auction - mart - that Lione : Haughton is no pauper cousin - no penniless fortune - hunter . I wish that world to be kind to him while he is yet young , and can enjoy it . Ah , Morley , Pleasure , like Punishment , hobbles after us , pede claudo . What would have delighted us yesterday does not catch us up till to - morrow , and yesterday 's pleasure is not the morrow 's . A pennyworth of sugar - plums would have made our eyes sparkle when we were scrawling pot - hooks at a preparatory school , but no one gave us sugar - plums then . Now every day at dessert France heaps before us her daintiest sugar - plums in gilt bonbonnieres . Do you ever covet them ? I never do . Let Lionel have his sugar - plums in time . And as we talk , there he comes . Lionel , how are you ? "
213948	213958	213960	213961	the Colonel	13877	" I resign you to Lionel 's charge now , "
213968	214057	214063	214063	Darrell	512	" I have an engagement - trouble some . Two silly friends of mine have been quarrelling - high words - in an age when duels are out of the question . I have promised to meet another man , and draw up the form for a mutual apology . High words are so stupid nowadays . No option but to swallow them up again if they were as high as steeples . Adieu for the present . We meet to - night at Lady Dulcett 's concert ? "
214058	214061	214063	214063	Darrell	512	" Yes , "
214065	214090	214091	214091	LIONELL	990	" I promised Miss Vyvyan to be there , and keep her from disturbing the congregation . You Lionel , will come with me . "
214095	214110	214119	214120	the Colonel	13877	" No ; you must excuse me . I have long been engaged elsewhere . "
214111	214117	214119	214120	the Colonel	13877	" That 's a pity , "
214124	214143	214181	214181	Darrell	512	" Lady Dulcett 's conceit is just one of the places where a young man should be seen . "
214175	214179	214181	214181	Darrell	512	" Unalterable man , "
214193	214564	214593	214593	he	512	" ' Through all the mutations on Time 's dusty high - road - stable as a milestone . Just what Alban Morley was as a school - boy he is now ; and if mortal span were extended to the age of the patriarchs , just what Alban Morley is now , Alban Morley would be a thousand years hence . I do n't mean externally , of course ; wrinkles will come - cheeks will fade . But these are trifles : man 's body is a garment , as Socrates said before me , and every seven years , according to the physiologists , man has a new suit , fibre and cuticle , from top to toe . The interior being that wears the clothes is the same in Alban Morley . Has he loved , hated , rejoiced , suffered ? Where is the sign ? Not one . At school , as in life , doing nothing , but decidedly somebody - respected by small boys , petted by big boys - an authority with all . Never getting honours - arm and arm with those who did ; never in scrapes - advising those who were ; imperturbable , immovable , calm above mortal cares as an Epicurean deity . What can wealth give that he has not got ? In the houses of the richest he chooses his room . Talk of ambition , talk of power - he has their rewards without an effort . True prime minister of all the realm he cares for ; good society has not a vote against him - he transacts its affairs , he knows its secrets - he yields its patronage . Ever requested to do a favour - no loan great enough to do him one . Incorruptible , yet versed to a fraction in each man 's price ; impeccable , yet confidant in each man 's foibles ; smooth as silk , hard as adamant ; impossible to wound , vex , annoy him - but not insensible ; thoroughly kind . Dear , dear Alban ! nature never polished a finer gentleman out of a solider block of man ! "

I have been several days in London , and not yet called on your mother . Will you accompany me now to her house and present me ? "
214659	214687	214593	214593	he	512	" Thank you , thank you ; you will make her so proud and happy ; but may I ride on and prepare her for your visit ? "

He must not be seen bowing to snobs , nor should his enemies track him to the haunts of vulgarians . I date my fall in life to dining with a horrid man who lent me L100 , and lived in Upper Baker Street . His wife took my arm from a place they called a drawing - room the Captain as he spoke was on a fourth floor , to share some unknown food which they called a dinner the Captain at that moment would have welcomed a rasher . The woman went about blabbing - the thing got wind - for the first time my character received a soil . What is a man without character ! and character once sullied , Jessie , man becomes reckless . Teach my boy to beware of the first false step - no association with parvenus . Do n't cry , Jessie - I do n't mean that he is to cut your - relations are quite different from other people - nothing so low as cutting relations . I continued , for instance , to visit Guy Darrell , though he lived at the back of Holborn , and I actually saw him once in brown beaver gloves . But he was a relation . I have even dined at his house , and met odd people there - people who lived also at the back of Holborn . But he did not ask me to go to their houses , and if he had , I must have cut him . "
215762	215813	215720	215721	Mrs. Haughton	515	" Dear me , Lionel , is that you ? Just tell me , you who go to all those grandees , whether the ratafia - cakes should be opposite to the sponge - cakes , or whether they would not go better - thus - at cross - corners ? "
215814	215860	215720	215721	Mrs. Haughton	515	" My dear mother , I never observed - I do n't know . But make haste - take off that apron - have those doors shut come upstairs . Mr. Darrell will be here very shortly . I have ridden on to prepare you . "
215861	215901	215720	215721	Mrs. Haughton	515	" Mr. Darrell - TO - DAY - HOW could you let him come ? Oh , Lionel , how thoughtless you are ! You should have some respect for your mother - I am your mother , sir . "
215902	215947	215973	215974	Mrs. Haughton	515	" Yes , my own dear mother - do n't scold - I could not help it . He is so engaged , so sought after ; if I had put him off to - day , he might never have come , and - "
215948	215971	215720	215721	Mrs. Haughton	515	" Never have come ! Who is Mr. Darrell , to give himself such airs ? - Only a lawyer after all , "
215979	215998	215720	215721	Mrs. Haughton	515	" Oh , mother , that speech is not like you . He is our benefactor - our - "
215999	216069	216077	216077	Lionel	419	" Do n't , do n't say very more - I was very wrong - quite wicked - only my temper , Lionel dear . Good Mr. Darrell ! I shall be so happy to see him - see him , too , in this house that I owe to him - see him by your side ! I think I shall fall down on my knees to him . "
216084	216115	215720	215721	Mrs. Haughton	515	" That 's my own mother now indeed - now I am proud of you , mother ; and how well you look ! I am proud of that too . "
216116	216233	216821	216821	she	515	" Look well - I am not fit to be seen , this figure - though perhaps an elderly quiet gentleman like good Mr. Darrell does not notice ladies much . John , John , makes haste with those plants . Gracious me ! you 've got your coat off ! - put it on - I expect a gentleman - I 'm at home , in the front drawing - room - no - that 's all set out - the back drawing - room , John . Send Susan to me . Lionel , do just look at the supper - table ; and what is to be done with the flowers , and - "
216816	216820	216821	216821	she	515	" Poor man , "
216824	216906	216931	216931	she	515	" he must be very lonely . He is not , like Lionel , a young dancing man . A quiet little party , with people of his own early rank and habits , would be more in his way than those grand places to which Lionel goes . I can but ask him - I ought to ask him . What would he say if I did not ask him ? Black ingratitude indeed , if he were not asked ! "
216934	216944	216962	216962	she	515	" I have a little party to - night ! "
216965	216983	216962	216962	she	515	" There may be some good music - young friends of mine - sing charmingly - Italians ! "
216992	217023	217030	217030	Darrell	512	" And if I might presume to think it would amuse you , Mr. Darrell , oh , I should be so happy to see you ! - so happy ! "
217024	217028	217030	217030	Darrell	512	" Would you ? "
217034	217059	216962	216962	she	515	" Then I should be a churl if I did not come . Lionel will escort me . Of course you expect him too ? "
217060	217106	217163	217163	his	512	" Yes , indeed . Though he has so many fine places to go to - and it ca n't be exactly what he is used to - yet he is such a dear good boy that he gives up all to gratify his mother . "
217167	217187	217204	217205	Mrs. Haughton	515	" And to gratify his mother is a pleasure I thank you for inviting me to share with him . "
217217	217228	217247	217247	Darrell	512	" And if you like to play a quiet rubber - "
217229	217245	217350	217350	he	512	" I never touch cards - I abhor the very name of them , ma'am , "
217338	217348	217350	217350	he	512	" I like your mother much - very much , "
217358	217418	217591	217591	she	515	" Good boy ! I see now why you gave up Lady Dulcett . Go and take a canter by yourself , or with younger friends , and be sure you call on me so that we may be both at Mrs. Haughton 's by ten o'clock . I can go later to the concert if I feel inclined . "
217601	217605	217809	217809	she	515	" visiting acquaintance . "
217828	217835	217879	217879	she	515	" Mrs. Haughton , Gloucester Place , "
217891	217912	217879	217879	she	515	" Thus , long before the end of five years , Mrs. Haughton had attained her object . She had a "
217916	218149	218213	218214	Mrs. Haughton	515	" It is true that she was not particular ; so that there was a new somebody at whose house a card could be left , or a morning call achieved - who could help to fill her rooms , or whose rooms she could contribute to fill in turn . She was contented . She was no tuft - hunter . She did not care for titles . She had no visions of a column in the Morning Post . She wanted , kind lady , only a vent for the exuberance of her social instincts ; and being proud , she rather liked acquaintances who looked up to , instead of looking down on her . Thus Gloucester Place was invaded by tribes not congenial to its natural civilised atmosphere . Hengists and Horsas , from remote Anglo - Saxon districts , crossed the intervening channel , and insulted the British nationality of that salubrious district . To most of such immigrators , Mrs. Haughton , of Gloucester Place , was a personage of the highest distinction . A few others of prouder status in the world , though they owned to themselves that there was a sad mixture at Mrs. Haughton 's house , still , once seduced there , came again - being persons who , however independent in fortune or gentle by blood , had but a small "
218152	218201	218236	218247	the head attendant , sent with the ices from the neighbouring confectioner	7073	" in town ; fresh from economical colonisation on the Continent or from distant provinces in these three kingdoms . Mrs. Haughton 's rooms were well lighted . There was music for some , whist for others ; tea , ices , cakes , and a crowd for all .
218255	218262	218301	218302	the polite	7077	" Mr. Haughton - Mr. Darrell . "
218306	218311	218325	218326	Mrs. Haughton	515	" a sad mixture , "
218328	218332	218393	218394	Mrs. Haughton	515	" visiting acquaintance . "
218361	218392	218444	218481	one pale , puff - cheeked , flat - nosed gentleman , in a very large white waistcoat , who was waiting by her side till a vacancy in one of the two whist - tables should occur	7086	" Darrell ! what ! the Darrell ! Guy Darrell ! greatest man of the day ! A connection of yours ? Bless me , you do n't say so ? "
218439	218442	218444	218481	one pale , puff - cheeked , flat - nosed gentleman , in a very large white waistcoat , who was waiting by her side till a vacancy in one of the two whist - tables should occur	7086	" Ma'am , "
218483	218509	218573	218573	he	2232	" Ma'am , I 'm an enthusiastic admirer of Mr. Darrell . You say he is a connection of yours ? Present me to him . "
218598	218618	218623	218624	Mrs. Haughton	515	" In these anxious times , public men dispense with ceremony . I crave an introduction to Mr. Darrell . "
218633	218641	218655	218656	Mr. Poole	793	" Mr. Adolphus Poole - Mr. Darrell , "
218649	218653	218655	218656	Mr. Poole	793	" Mr. Darrell , "
218663	218669	218670	218670	Darrell	512	" this is an honour . "
218686	218706	218738	218738	himself	793	" If I were still at the bar I should be sorry to hold a brief for that fellow . "
218739	218743	218913	218913	he	512	" much flattered , "
218908	218912	218913	218913	he	512	" Excuse me , "
218920	218928	219005	219005	He	512	" but I see an old friend . "
219016	219031	219038	219043	the ex - mayor of Gatesboro	7106	" My dear Mr. Hartopp , do you not remember me - Guy Darrell ? "
219032	219036	219038	219043	the ex - mayor of Gatesboro	7106	" Mr. Darrell ! "
219048	219058	219005	219005	He	512	" who could think that you would remember me ? "
219059	219125	219005	219005	He	512	" What ! not remember those ten stubborn voters , on whom , all and singly , I had lavished my powers of argument in vain ? You came , and with the brief words , ' John - Ned - Dick - oblige me - vote for Darrell ! ' the men were convinced - the votes won . That 's what I call eloquence "
219130	219139	219005	219005	He	512	" Confound that fellow ! still after me ! "
219144	219167	219173	219173	Hartopp	682	" Oh ! may I ask who is that Mr. What's - his - name - there - in the white waistcoat ? "
219168	219171	219173	219173	Hartopp	682	" Poole , "
219175	219307	219038	219043	the ex - mayor of Gatesboro	7106	" Who is he , sir ? A speculative man . He is connected with a new Company - I am told it answers . Williams that 's my foreman - a very long head he has too has taken shares in the Company , and wanted me to do the same , but ' tis not in my way . And Mr. Poole may be a very honest man , but he does not impress me with that idea . I have grown careless ; I know I am liable to be taken in - I was so once - and therefore I avoid ' Companies ' upon principle - especially when they promise thirty per cent . , and work copper mines - Mr. Poole has a copper mine . "
219308	219350	219173	219173	Hartopp	682	" And deals in brass - you may see it in his face ! But you are not in town for good , Mr. Hartopp ? If I remember right , you were settled at Gatesboro ' when we last met . "
219351	219499	219038	219043	the ex - mayor of Gatesboro	7106	" And so I am still - or rather in the neighbourhood . I am gradually retiring from business , and grown more and more fond of farming . But I have a family , and we live in enlightened times , when children require a finer education than their parents had . Mrs. Hartopp thought my daughter Anna Maria was in need of some ' finishing lessons ' - very fond of the harp is Anna Maria - and so we have taken a house in London for six weeks . That 's Mrs. Hartopp yonder , with the bird on her head - bird of paradise , I believe ; Williams says birds of that kind never rest . That bird is an exception - it has rested on Mrs. Hartopp 's head for hours together , every evening since we have been in town . "
219500	219510	219173	219173	Hartopp	682	" Significant of your connubial felicity , Mr. Hartopp . "
219511	219597	219038	219043	the ex - mayor of Gatesboro	7106	" May it be so of Anna Maria ' s. She is to be married when her education is finished - married , by the by , to a son of your old friend Jessop , of Ouzelford ; and between you and me , Mr. Darrell , that is the reason why I consented to come to town . Do not suppose that I would have a daughter finished unless there was a husband at hand who undertook to be responsible for the results . "
219598	219676	219684	219684	Hartopp	682	" You retain your wisdom , Mr. Hartopp ; and I feel sure that not even your fair partner could have brought you up to London unless you had decided on the expediency of coming . Do you remember that I told you the day you so admirably settled a dispute in our committee - room , ' it was well you were not born a king , for you would have been an irresistible tyrant ' ? "
219677	219682	219684	219684	Hartopp	682	" Hush ! hush ! "
219690	219728	219735	219735	Darrell	512	" if Mrs. H. should hear you ! What an observer you are , sir . I thought I was a judge of character - but I was once deceived . I dare say you never were . "
219729	219733	219735	219735	Darrell	512	" You mistake , "
219739	219745	219810	219810	Darrell	512	" you deceived ! How ? "
219746	219808	219735	219735	Darrell	512	" Oh , a long story , sir . It was an elderly man - the most agreeable , interesting companion - a vagabond nevertheless - and such a pretty bewitching little girl with him , his grandchild . I thought he might have been a wild harumscarum chap in his day , but that he had a true sense of honour "
219829	219907	219912	219912	Darrell	512	" Only think , sir , just as I was saying to myself , ' I know character - I never was taken in , ' down comes a smart fellow - the man 's own son - and tells me - or rather he suffers a lady who comes with him to tell me - that this charming old gentleman of high sense of honour was a returned convict - been transported for robbing his employer . "
219919	219928	219735	219735	Darrell	512	" What was the name of - of - "
219929	219948	219954	219954	Darrell	512	" The convict ? He called himself Chapman , but the son 's name was Losely - Jasper . "
219949	219952	219954	219954	Darrell	512	" Ah ! "
219958	219967	219735	219735	Darrell	512	" And you spoke of a little girl ? "
219968	220004	219954	219954	Darrell	512	" Jasper Losely 's daughter ; he came after her with a magistrate 's warrant . The old miscreant had carried her off , - to teach her his own swindling ways , I suppose . "
220005	220040	219735	219735	Darrell	512	" Luckily she was then in my charge . I gave her back to her father , and the very respectable - looking lady he brought with him . Some relation , I presume . "
220041	220051	219954	219954	Darrell	512	" What was her name , do you remember ? "
220052	220055	220064	220064	Darrell	512	" Crane . "
220056	220062	220064	220064	Darrell	512	" Crane ! - Crane ! "
220079	220093	219954	219954	Darrell	512	" So he said the child was his daughter - are you sure ? "
220094	220118	220064	220064	Darrell	512	" Oh , of course he said so , and the lady too . But can you be acquainted with their , sir ? "
220119	220163	219954	219954	Darrell	512	" I ? - no ! Strangers to me , except by repute . Liars - infamous liars ! But have the accomplices quarrelled - I mean the son and father - that the father should be exposed and denounced by the son ? "
220164	220251	220302	220302	he	682	" I conclude so . I never saw them again . But you believe the father really was , then , a felon , a convict - no excuse for him - no extenuating circumstances ? There was something in that man , Mr. Darrell , that made one love him - positively love him ; and when I had to tell him that I had given up the child he trusted to my charge , and saw his grief , I felt a criminal myself . "
220293	220301	220393	220394	the crowd	1276	" You think I was a criminal ! "
220307	220377	220393	220394	the crowd	1276	" I think we are both talking too much , Mr. Hartopp , of a gang of miserable swindlers , and I advise you to dismiss the whole remembrance of intercourse with any of them from your honest breast , and never to repeat to other ears the tale you have poured into mine . Men of honour should crush down the very thought that approaches them to knaves . "
220435	220445	220525	220525	he	984	" Let me assist you , sir - do : "
220521	220524	220525	220525	he	984	" Sir , "
220532	220544	220555	220556	Mr. Poole	793	" your importunities annoy me I request you to cease them . "
220545	220553	220555	220556	Mr. Poole	793	" Oh , I ask your pardon , "
220563	220607	220610	220610	his	984	" I have no need to force myself on any man . But I beg you to believe that if I presumed to seek your acquaintance , it was to do you a service sir - yes , a private service , sir . "
220624	220661	220672	220672	Darrell	512	" There 's one Jasper Losely , sir - eh ? Oh , sir , I 'm no mischief - maker . I respect family secrets . Perhaps I might be of use , perhaps not . "
220662	220670	220704	220704	Darrell	512	" Certainly not to me , sir , "
220711	220726	220738	220738	Darrell	512	" Anywhere for half an hour - to St. Paul 's , then home . "
220745	220754	221341	221342	Mr. Poole	793	" To Belgrave Square - Lady Dulcett 's . "
221278	221340	221748	221749	Mr. Poole	793	" But the house being let for ninety - nine years - relet again on a running lease of seven , fourteen , and twenty - one - the builder is not answerable for duration , nor the original lessee for repairs . Take it altogether , than Alhambra Villa masonry could devise no better type of modern taste and metropolitan speculation .

221850	221854	221856	221858	Adolphus Samuel Poole	1001	" The money , "
221860	221875	221977	221977	she	1003	" is not my object ; but I like to have something to do . "
221967	221975	221977	221977	she	1003	" Come and kiss Pa , Johnny , "
221982	221990	222015	222016	Mrs. Poole	1003	" Mrs. Poole , I am busy , "
221993	222013	221992	221992	Pa.	1005	" Pa 's busy - working hard for little Johnny . Johnny will be better for it some day , "
222037	222046	221992	221992	Pa.	1005	" Mrs. Poole , what do you want ? "
222047	222129	221992	221992	Pa.	1005	" May I hire Jones 's brougham for two hours to - day , to pay visits ? There are a great many cards we ought to leave ; is there any place where I should leave a card for you , lovey - any person of consequence you were introduced to at Mrs. Haughton 's last night ? That great man they were all talking about , to whom you seemed to take such a fancy , Samuel , duck - "
222130	222144	221992	221992	Pa.	1005	" Do get out ! that man insulted me , I tell you . "
222145	222156	221992	221992	Pa.	1005	" Insulted you ! No ; you never told me . "
222157	222167	221992	221992	Pa.	1005	" I did tell you last night coming home . "
222168	222180	221992	221992	Pa.	1005	" Dear me , I thought you meant that Mr. Hartopp . "
222181	222208	221992	221992	Pa.	1005	" Well , he almost insulted me , too . Mrs. Poole , you are stupid and disagreeable . Is that all you have to say ? "
222209	222241	222409	222410	Mrs. Poole	1003	" Pa 's cross , Johnny dear ! poor Pa ! - people have vexed Pa , Johnny - naughty people . We must go or we shall vex him too . "
222309	222408	222471	222471	Poole	1003	" Well , Mrs. Poole , excuse me . I own I am out of sorts to - day - give me little Johnny - there kissing the infant ; who in return makes a dig at Pa 's left eye , and begins to cry on finding that he has not succeeded in digging it out - take the brougham . Hush , Johnny - hush - and you may leave a card for me at Mr. Peckham 's , Harley Street . My eye smarts horribly ; that baby will gouge me one of these days . "
222477	222501	222596	222597	Mrs. Poole	1003	" Nonsense , blarney - by the by , I did not say this morning that you should not have the rosewood chiffoniere ! "
222502	222538	222471	222471	Poole	1003	" No , you said you could not afford it , duck ; and when Pa says he ca n't afford it , Pa must be the judge - must not he , Johnny dear ? "
222539	222595	222608	222608	She	1003	" But perhaps I can afford it . Yes , you may have it yes , I say , you shall have it . Do n't forget to leave that card on Peckham - he 's a moneyed man . There 's a ring at the bell . Who is it ? run and see . "
222616	222664	222671	222671	Poole	1003	" Oh , my Adolphus - I oh , my Samuel ! it is that dreadful - looking man who was here the other evening - stayed with you so long . I do n't like his looks at all . Pray do n't be at home . "
222665	222669	222703	222703	He	7193	" I must , "
222683	222702	222766	222766	he	7193	" Stop - do n't let that girl go to the door ; and you - leave me . "
222730	222733	222805	222805	Poole	1003	" ring , "
222813	222833	222849	222849	Jasper	721	" What , you ! I am just going to my office - in a great hurry at present . "
222834	222847	222805	222805	Poole	1003	" Hurry or not , I must and will speak to you , "
222853	222875	222909	222909	his	7193	" What now ? then , step in ; - only remember I ca n't give you more than five minutes . "
222928	222977	222994	222994	Poole	790	" Now , mark me , Dolly Poole , if you think to shirk my business , or throw me over , you 'll find yourself in Queer Street . Have you called on Guy Darrell , and put my case to him , or have you not ? "
222978	222993	223064	223064	Poole	790	" I met Mr. Darrell only last night , at a very genteel party . "
223056	223062	223064	223064	Poole	790	" A very genteel party , "
223066	223086	223043	223043	he	7202	" I made a point of being presented to Mr. Darrell , and very polite he was at first . "
223087	223097	223064	223064	Poole	790	" Curse his politeness - get to the point . "
223098	223181	223043	223043	he	7202	" I sounded my way very carefully , as you may suppose ; and when I had got him into friendly chat , you understand , I began ; Ah ! my poor Losely , nothing to be done there - he flew off in a tangent - as much as desired me to mind my own business , and hold my tongue ; and upon my life , I do n't think there is a chance for you in that quarter . "
223182	223206	223064	223064	Poole	790	" Very well - we shall see . Next , have you taken any steps to find out the girl , my daughter ? "
223207	223236	223269	223269	Jasper	721	" I have , I assure you . But you give me so slight a clue . Are you quite sure she is not in America after all ? "
223237	223267	223269	223269	Jasper	721	" I have told you before that that story about America was all bosh ! a stratagem of the old gentleman 's to deceive me . Poor old man , "
223279	223679	223064	223064	Poole	790	" I do n't wonder that he dreads and flies me ; yet I would not hurt him more than I have done , even to be as well off as you are - blinking at me from your mahogany perch like a pet owl with its crop full of mice . And if I would take the girl from him , it is for her own good . For if Darrell could be got to make a provision on her , and , through her , on myself , why , of course the old man should share the benefit of it . And now that these infernal pains often keep me awake half the night , I ca n't always shut out the idea of that old man wandering about the world , and dying in a ditch . And that runaway girl - to whom , I dare swear , he would give away his last crumb of bread - ought to be an annuity to us both : Basta , basta ! As to the American story - I had a friend at Paris , who went to America on a speculation ; I asked him to inquire about this Willaim Waife and his granddaughter Sophy , who were said to have sailed for New York nearly five years ago , and he saw the very persons - settled in New York - no longer under the name of Waife , but their true name of Simpson , and got out from the man that they had been induced to take their passage from England in the name of Waife , at the request of a person whom the mail would not - give up , but to whom he said he was under obligations . Perhaps the old gentleman had done the fellow a kind turn in early life . The description of this soi - disant Waife and his grandchild settles the matter - wholly unlike those I seek ; so that there is every reason to suppose they must still be in England , and it is your business to find them . Continue your search - quicken your wits - let me be better pleased with your success when I call again this day week - and meanwhile four pounds , if you please - as much more as you like . "
223680	223704	223269	223269	Jasper	721	" Why , I gave you four pounds the other day , besides six pounds for clothes ; it ca n't be gone . "
223705	223709	223064	223064	Poole	790	" Every penny . "
223710	223750	223269	223269	Jasper	721	" Dear , dear ! ca n't you maintain yourself anyhow ? Ca n't you get any one to play at cards ? Four pounds ! Why , with your talent for whist , four pounds are a capital ! "
223751	223816	223064	223064	Poole	790	" Whom can I play with ! Whom can I herd with ? Cracksmen and pickpockets . Fit me out ; ask me to your own house ; invite your own friends ; make up a rubber , and you will then see what I can do with four pounds ; and may go shares if you like , as we used to do . "
223817	223845	223269	223269	Jasper	721	" Do n't talk so loud . Losely , you know very well that what you ask is impossible . I 've turned over a new leaf . "
223846	223859	223064	223064	Poole	790	" But I 've still got your handwriting on the old leaf . "
223860	223892	223269	223269	Jasper	721	" What 's the good of these stupid threats ? If you really wanted to do me a mischief , where could you go to , and who 'd believe you ? "
223893	223906	223064	223064	Poole	790	" I fancy your wife would . I 'll try . Hillo - "
223907	223935	223269	223269	Jasper	721	" Stop - stop - stop . No row here , sir . No scandal . Hold your tongue , or I 'll send for the police . "
223936	223980	223064	223064	Poole	790	" Do ! Nothing I should like better . I 'm tired out . I want to tell my own story at the Old Bailey , and have my revenge upon you , upon Darrell , upon all . Send for the police . "
224001	224051	223064	223064	Poole	790	" You could only give me five minutes - they are gone , I fear . I am more liberal . I give you your own time to consider . I do n't care if I stay to dine ; I dare say Mrs. Poole will excuse my dress . "
224052	224088	223064	223064	Poole	790	" Losely , you are such a - fellow ! If I do give you the four pounds you ask , will you promise to shift for yourself somehow , and molest me no more ? "
224089	224113	223064	223064	Poole	790	" Certainly not . I shall come once every week for the same sum . I ca n't live upon less - until - "
224114	224118	223064	223064	Poole	790	" Until what ? "
224119	224215	223064	223064	Poole	790	" Until either you get Mr. Darrell to settle on me a suitable provision ; or until you place me in possession of my daughter , and I can then be in a better condition to treat with him myself ; for if I would make a claim on account of the girl , I must produce the girl , or he may say she is dead . Besides , if she be as pretty as she was when a child , the very sight of her might move him more than all my talk . "
224216	224250	223064	223064	Poole	790	" And if I succeed in doing anything with Mr. Darrell , or discovering your daughter , you will give up all such letters and documents of mine as you say you possess ? "
224251	224283	224317	224317	he	7209	" ' Say I possess ! ' I have shown them to you in this pocket - book , Dolly Poole - your own proposition to rob old Latham 's safe . "
224322	224341	224317	224317	he	7209	" Turn against one 's own crony ! So unhandsome , so unlike what I thought you were . "
224342	224411	224517	224517	he	7210	" It is you who would turn against me . But stick to Darrell or find me my daughter , and help her and me to get justice out of him ; and you shall not only have back these letters , but I 'll pay you handsomely - handsomely , Dolly Poole . Zooks , sir - I am fallen , but I am always a gentleman . "
224511	224516	224814	224815	her father	1381	" This day week , "
224822	224904	224958	224958	Darrell	512	" Adela , Mr. Darrell has been greatly struck with your appearance - he told me so . He is not young , but he is still a very fine looking man , and you are twenty - seven . ' Tis a greater distinction to be noticed by a person of his years and position , than by a pack of silly young fellows , who think more of their own pretty faces than they would ever do of yours . "
224905	224957	224996	224996	She	983	" If you did not mind a little disparity of years , he would make you a happy wife ; and , in the course of nature , a widow , not too old to enjoy liberty , and with a jointure that might entitle you to a still better match . "
224991	224995	225717	225717	Honoria	982	" interesting man . "
225707	225716	225717	225717	Honoria	982	" I will marry the man I love . "
225722	225732	226218	226218	his	512	" I will only marry the man I respect . "
226223	226257	226512	226513	Colonel Morley	628	" Come and be the spoiled darling of my gladdened age ; let my life , ere it sink into night , be rejoiced by the bloom and fresh breeze of the morning . "
226507	226510	226512	226513	Colonel Morley	628	" Darrell , "
226515	226591	226638	226638	Darrell	512	" you remember my nephew George as a boy ? He is now the rector of Humberston ; married - a very nice sort of woman - suits him Humberston is a fine living ; but his talents are wasted there . He preached for the first time in London last year , and made a considerable sensation . This year he has been much out of town . He has no church here as yet .
226592	226637	226695	226698	an educated English Churchman	7291	" I hope to get him one . Carr is determined that he shall be a Bishop . Meanwhile he preaches at - Chapel tomorrow ; come and hear him with me , and then tell me frankly - is he eloquent or not ? "
226699	226708	226903	226903	he	512	" Strong without rage , without o'erflowing full . "
226889	226897	226934	226935	The congregation	15464	" Cast down , but not destroyed ; "
226940	226942	227110	227110	Darrell	512	" brilliant "
227120	227148	227158	227158	he	512	" Your nephew takes me by surprise . The Church wants such men . He will have a grand career , if life be spared to him . "
227162	227184	227185	227186	The Colonel	13877	" Your nephew was , at school with my boy . Had my son lived , what had been his career ? "
227197	227242	227347	227347	Darrell	512	" Bring George to see me to - morrow . I shrunk from asking it before : I thought the sight of him would too much revive old sorrows ; but I feel I should accustom myself to face every memory . Bring him . "
227334	227345	227347	227347	Darrell	512	" I remember you , George , as a boy , "
227349	227369	227370	227370	He	512	" and thanked you then for good advice to a schoolfellow , who is lost to your counsels now . "
227380	227598	227604	227605	the Colonel	13877	" You had then a slight defect in utterance , which , I understand from your uncle , increased as you grew older ; so that I never anticipated for you the fame that you are achieving . Orator fit - you must have been admirably taught . In the management of your voice , in the excellence of your delivery , I see that you are one of the few who deem that the Divine Word should not be unworthily uttered . The debater on beer bills may be excused from studying the orator 's effects ; but all that enforce , dignify , adorn , make the becoming studies of him who strives by eloquence to people heaven ; whose task it is to adjure the thoughtless , animate the languid , soften the callous , humble the proud , alarm the guilty , comfort the sorrowful , call back to the fold the lost . Is the culture to be slovenly where the glebe is so fertile ? The only field left in modern times for the ancient orator 's sublime conceptions , but laborious training , is the Preacher 's . And I own , George , that I envy the masters who skilled to the Preacher 's art an intellect like yours . "
227599	227602	227604	227605	the Colonel	13877	" Masters , "
227607	227641	227659	227659	Darrell	512	" I thought all those elocution masters failed with you , George . You cured and taught yourself . Did not you ? No ! Why , then , who was your teacher ? "
227704	227724	227659	227659	Darrell	512	" You have been to the country , I hear , George ; at your living , I suppose ? "
227725	227739	227752	227753	the Colonel	13877	" No . I have not been there very lately ; travelling about . "
227740	227750	227659	227659	Darrell	512	" Have you seen Lady Montfort since your return ? "
227755	227775	227785	227786	the Colonel	13877	" I only returned on Saturday night . I go to Lady Montfort 's at Twickenham , this evening . "
227776	227783	227785	227786	the Colonel	13877	" She has a delightful retreat , "
227788	227893	227903	227903	George	855	" But if she wish to avoid admiration , she should not make the banks of the river her favourite haunt . I know some romantic admirers , who , when she re - appears in the world , may be rival aspirants , and who have much taken to rowing since Lady Montfort has retired to Twickenham . They catch a glimpse of her , and return to boast of it . But they report that there is a young lady seen walking with her an extremely pretty one - who is she ? People ask me - as if I knew everything . "
227894	227901	227903	227903	George	855	" A companion , I suppose , "
227910	227934	227976	227977	the Colonel	13877	" But , pardon me , I must leave you now . Good - bye , uncle . Good day , Mr. Darrell . "
227966	227974	227976	227977	the Colonel	13877	" If my nephew were not married , "
227979	228046	228063	228063	Darrell	512	" I should regard his embarrassment with much suspicion - embarrassed at every point , from his travels about the country to the question of a young lady at Twickenham . I wonder who that young lady can be - not one of the Viponts , or I should have heard . Are there any young ladies on the Lyndsay side ? - Eh , Darrell ? "
228047	228061	228093	228094	the Colonel	13877	" What do I care ? - your head runs on young ladies , "
228079	228091	228133	228134	the Colonel	13877	" And your feet do not seem to run from them , "
228150	228174	228180	228181	the Colonel	13877	" If you are not very much occupied , will you waste half an hour on me ? - I am going homewards . "
228183	228263	228180	228181	the Colonel	13877	" Are you in want of your cabriolet to - day , or can you lend it to me ? I have asked a Frenchman , who brings me a letter of introduction , to dine at the nearest restaurant 's to which one can ask a Frenchman . I need not say that is Greenwich : and if I took him in a cabriolet , he would not suspect that he was taken five miles out of town . "
228264	228278	228180	228181	the Colonel	13877	" Alas , my dear Colonel , I have just sold my cabriolet . "
228322	228322	228328	228328	Lionel	419	"
228323	228326	228343	228344	the Colonel	13877	" Both , "
228332	228341	228343	228344	the Colonel	13877	" Nothing surprises me that man can do , "
228346	228406	228180	228181	the Colonel	13877	" or I should be surprised . When , acting on Darrell 's general instructions for your outfit , I bought that horse , I flattered myself that I had chosen well . But rare are good horses - rarer still a good judge of them ; I suppose I was cheated , and the brute proved a screw . "
228407	228457	228343	228344	the Colonel	13877	" The finest cab - horse in London , my dear Colonel , and every one knows how proud I was of him . But I wanted money , and had nothing else that would bring the sum I required . Oh , Colonel Morley , do hear me ? "
228458	228501	228180	228181	the Colonel	13877	" Certainly , I am not deaf , nor is St. James 's Street . When a man says , ' I have parted with my horse because I wanted money , ' I advise him to say it in a whisper . "
228502	228757	228772	228773	the Colonel	13877	" I have been imprudent , at least unlucky , and I must pay the penalty . A friend of mine - that is , not exactly a friend , but an acquaintance - whom I see every day - one of my own set - asked me to sign my name at Paris to a bill at three months ' date , as his security . He gave me his honour that I should hear no more of it - he would be sure to take up the bill when due - a man whom I supposed to be as well off as myself ! You will allow that I could scarcely refuse - at all events , I did not . The bill became due two days ago ; my friend does not pay it , and indeed says he can not , and the holder of the bill calls on me . He was very civil - offered to renew it - pressed me to take my time , c. ; but I did not like his manner : and as to my friend , I find that , instead of being well off , as I supposed , he is hard up , and that I am not the first he has got into the same scrape - not intending it , I am sure . He 's really a very good fellow , and , if I wanted security , would be it to - morrow to any amount . "
228758	228770	228180	228181	the Colonel	13877	" I 've no doubt of it - to any amount ! "
228775	228837	228180	228181	the Colonel	13877	" So I thought it best to conclude the matter at once . I had saved nothing from my allowance , munificent as it is . I could not have the face to ask Mr. Darrell to remunerate me for my own imprudence . I should not like to borrow from my mother - I know it would be inconvenient to her .
228838	228882	228893	228894	the Colonel	13877	" I sold both horse and cabriolet this morning . I had just been getting the cheque cashed when I met you . I intend to take the money myself to the bill - holder . I have just the sum - L200 . "
228883	228891	228893	228894	the Colonel	13877	" The horse alone was worth that , "
228901	229043	229051	229051	Lionel	419	" not to be replaced . France and Russia have the pick of our stables . However , if it is sold , it is sold - talk no more of it . I hate painful subjects . You did right not to renew the bill - it is opening an account with Ruin ; and though I avoid preaching on money matters , or , indeed , any other preaching is my nephew 's vocation , not mine , yet allow me to extract from you a solemn promise never again to sign bills , nor to draw them . Be to your friend what you please except security for him . Orestes never asked Pylades to help him to borrow at fifty per cent . Promise me - your word of honour as a gentleman ! Do you hesitate ? "
229044	229049	229051	229051	Lionel	419	" My dear Colonel , "
229054	229097	229104	229105	the Colonel	13877	" I do hesitate . I might promise not to sign a money - lender 's bill on my own account , though really I think you take rather an exaggerated view of what is , after all , a common occurrence - "
229098	229102	229104	229105	the Colonel	13877	" Do I ? "
229108	229146	229157	229157	Lionel	419	" I 'm sorry to hear it . I detest exaggeration . Go on . You might promise not to ruin yourself - but you object to promise not to help in the ruin of your friend . "
229147	229155	229157	229157	Lionel	419	" That is exquisite irony , Colonel , "
229161	229358	229104	229105	the Colonel	13877	" but it does not deal with the difficulty , which is simply this : When a man whom you call friend - whom you walk with , ride with , dine with almost every day , says to you ' I am in immediate want of a few hundreds - I do n't ask you to lend them to me , perhaps you ca n't - but assist me to borrow - trust to my honour that the debt shall not fall on you , - why , then , it seems as if to refuse the favour was to tell the man you call friend that you doubt his honour ; and though I have been caught once in that way , I feel that I must be caught very often before I should have the moral courage to say ' No ! ' Do n't ask me , then to promise - be satisfied with my assurance that , in future at least , I will be more cautious , and if the loss fall on me , why , the worst that can happen is to do again what I do now . "
229359	229430	229652	229652	Lionel	419	" Nay , you would not perhaps have another horse and cab to sell . In that case , you would do the reverse of what you do now - you would renew the bill - the debt would run on like a snowball - in a year or two you would owe , not hundreds , but thousands . But come in - here we are at my door . "
229611	229651	229717	229718	the Colonel	13877	" No man has more friends than I have - never did I lose one - never did I sign a bill . Your father pursued a different policy - he signed many bills - and lost many friends . "
229712	229715	229717	229718	the Colonel	13877	" Yes , "
229720	229996	230141	230142	the Colonel	13877	" it is the old story . One always begins by being security to a friend . The discredit of the thing is familiarised to one 's mind by the false show of generous confidence in another . Their what you have done for a friend , a friend should do for you ; - a hundred or two would be useful now - you are sure to repay it in three months . To Youth the Future seems safe as the Bank of England , and distant as the peaks of Himalaya . You pledge your honour that in three months you will release your friend . The three months expire . To release the one friend , you catch hold of another - the bill is renewed , premium and interest thrown into the next pay - day - soon the account multiplies , and with it the honour dwindles - your NAME circulates from hand to hand on the back of doubtful paper - your name , which , in all money transactions , should grow higher and higher each year you live , falling down every month like the shares in a swindling speculation . You begin by what you call trusting a friend , that is , aiding him to self - destruction - buying him arsenic to clear his complexion - you end by dragging all near you into your own abyss , as a drowning man would clutch at his own brother . Lionel Haughton , the saddest expression I ever saw in your father 's face was when - when - but you shall hear the story - "
229997	230026	229717	229718	the Colonel	13877	" No , sir ; spare me . Since you so insist on it , I will give the promise - it is enough ; and my father - "
230027	230112	230141	230142	the Colonel	13877	" Was as honourable as you when he first signed his name to a friend 's bill ; and , perhaps , promised to do so no more as reluctantly as you do . You had better let me say on ; if I stop now , you will forget all about it by this day twelve - month ; if I go on , you will never forget . There are other examples besides your father ; I am about to name one . "
230133	230139	230141	230142	the Colonel	13877	" When I was young , "
230144	230300	230306	230306	Lionel	419	" I chanced to make acquaintance with a man of infinite whim and humour ; fascinating as Darrell himself , though in a very different way . We called him Willy - you know the kind of man one calls by his Christian name , cordially abbreviated - that kind of man seems never to be quite grown up ; and , therefore , never rises in life . I never knew a man called Willy after the age of thirty , who did not come to a melancholy end ! Willy was the natural son of a rich , helter - skelter , cleverish , maddish , stylish , raffish , four - in - hand Baronet , by a celebrated French actress . The title is extinct now , and so , I believe , is that genus of stylish , raffish , four - in - hand Baronet - Sir Julian Losely - "
230301	230304	230306	230306	Lionel	419	" Losely ! "
230308	230317	230141	230142	the Colonel	13877	" Yes ; do you know the name ? "
230318	230345	230306	230306	Lionel	419	" I never heard it till yesterday . I want to tell you what I did hear then - but after your story - go on . "
230346	230716	230141	230142	the Colonel	13877	" Sir Julian Losely Willy 's father lived with the French lady as his wife , and reared Willy in his house , with as much pride and fondness as if he intended him for his heir . The poor boy , I suspect , got but little regular education ; though of course , he spoke his French mother 's tongue like a native ; and , thanks also perhaps to his mother , he had an extraordinary talent for mimicry and acting . His father was passionately fond of private theatricals , and Willy had early practice in that line . I once saw him act Falstaff in a country house , and I doubt if Quin could have acted it better . Well , when Willy was still a mere boy , he lost his mother , the actress . Sir Julian married - had a legitimate daughter - died intestate - and the daughter , of course , had the personal property , which was not much ; the heir - at - law got the land , and poor Willy nothing . But Willy was an universal favourite with his father 's old friends - wild fellows like Sir Julian himself amongst them there were two cousins , with large country - houses , sporting - men , and bachelors . They shared Willy between them , and quarrelled which should have the most of him . So he grew up to be man , with no settled provision , but always welcome , not only to the two cousins , but at every house in which , like Milton 's lark , ' he came to startle the dull night ' - the most amusing companion ! - a famous shot - a capital horseman - knew the ways of all animals , fishes , and birds ; I verily believe he could have coaxed a pug - dog to point , and an owl to sing . Void of all malice , up to all fun . Imagine how much people would court , and how little they would do for , a Willy of that sort . Do I bore you ? "
230717	230727	230306	230306	Lionel	419	" On the contrary , I am greatly interested . "
230728	230938	231493	231493	Willy	1028	" One thing a Willy , if a Willy could be wise , ought to do for himself - keep single . A wedded Willy is in a false position . My Willy wedded - for love too - an amiable girl , I believe I never saw her ; it was long afterwards that I knew Willy - but as poor as himself . The friends and relatives then said : ' This is serious : something - must be done for Willy . ' It was easy to say , ' something must be done , ' and monstrous difficult to do it . While the relations were consulting , his half - sister , the Baronet 's lawful daughter , died , unmarried ; and though she had ignored him in life , left him L2,000 . ' I have hit it now , ' cried one of the cousins ; ' Willy is fond of a country life . I will let him have a farm on a nominal rent , his L2,000 will stock it ; and his farm , which is surrounded by woods , will be a capital hunting - meet . As long as I live , Willy shall be mounted . '
230939	231492	231493	231493	Willy	1028	" Willy took the farm , and astonished his friends by attending to it . It was just beginning to answer when his wife died , leaving him only one child - a boy ; and her death made him so melancholy that he could no longer attend to his farm . He threw it up , invested the proceeds as a capital , and lived on the interest as a gentleman at large . He travelled over Europe for some time - chiefly on foot - came back , having recovered his spirits - resumed his old desultory purposeless life at different country - houses , and at one of those houses I and Charles Haughton met him . Here I pause , to state that Willy Losely at that time impressed me with the idea that he was a thoroughly honest man . Though he was certainly no formalist - though he had lived with wild sets of convivial scapegraces - though , out of sheer high spirits , he would now and then make conventional Proprieties laugh at their own long faces ; yet , I should have said that Bayard himself - and Bayard was no saint - could not have been more incapable of a disloyal , rascally , shabby action . Nay , in the plain matter of integrity , his ideas might be called refined , almost Quixotic . If asked to give or to lend , Willy 's hand was in his pocket in an instant ; but though thrown among rich men - careless as himself - Willy never put his hand into their pockets , never borrowed , never owed . He would accept hospitality - make frank use of your table , your horses , your dogs - but your money , no ! He repaid all he took from a host by rendering himself the pleasantest guest that host ever entertained . Poor Willy ! I think I see his quaint smile brimming over with sly sport ! The sound of his voice was like a cry of ' o - half - holiday ' in a schoolroom . He dishonest ! I should as soon have suspected the noonday sun of being a dark lantern ! I remember , when he and I were walking home from wild - duck shooting in advance of our companions , a short conversation between us that touched me greatly , for it showed that , under all his levity , there were sound sense and right feeling . I asked him about his son , then a boy at school : ' Why , as it was the Christmas vacation , he had refused our host 's suggestion to let the lad come down there ? ' ' Ah , ' said he , ' do n't fancy that I will lead my son to grow up a scatterbrained good - for - nought like his father . His society is the joy of my life ; whenever I have enough in my pockets to afford myself that joy , I go and hire a quiet lodging close by his school , to have him with me from Saturday till Monday all to myself - where he never hears wild fellows call me "
231495	231604	230306	230306	Lionel	419	" and ask me to mimic . I had hoped to have spent this vacation with him in that way , but his school bill was higher than usual , and after paying it , I had not a guinea to spare - obliged to come here where they lodge and feed me for nothing ; the boy 's uncle on the mother 's side - respectable man in business - kindly takes him home for the holidays ; but did not ask me , because his wife - and I do n't blame her - thinks I 'm too wild for a City clerk 's sober household . '
231605	231634	231493	231493	Willy	1028	" I asked Willy Losely what he meant to do with his son , and hinted that I might get the boy a commission in the army without purchase .
231635	231899	230306	230306	Lionel	419	" ' No , ' said Willy . ' I know what it is to set up for a gentleman on the capital of a beggar . It is to be a shuttlecock between discontent and temptation . I would not have my lost wife 's son waste his life as I have done . He would be more spoiled , too , than I have been . The handsomest boy you ever saw - and bold as a lion . Once in that set ' pointing over his shoulder towards some of our sporting comrades , whose loud laughter every now and then reached our ears - ' once in that set , he would never be out of it - fit for nothing . I swore to his mother on her death - bed that I would bring him up to avoid my errors - that he should be no hanger - on and led - captain ! Swore to her that he should be reared according to his real station - the station of his mother 's kin - I have no station - and if I can but see him an honest British trader - respectable , upright , equal to the highest - because no rich man 's dependant , and no poor man 's jest - my ambition will be satisfied . And now you understand , sir , why my boy is not here . ' You would say a father who spoke thus had a man 's honest stuff in him . Eh , Lionel ! "
231900	231912	231493	231493	Willy	1028	" Yes , and a true gentleman 's heart , too ! "
231913	232476	232504	232505	Alban Morley	628	" So I thought ; yet I fancied I knew the world ! After that conversation , I quitted our host 's roof , and only once or twice afterwards , at country - houses , met William Losely again . To say truth , his chief patrons and friends were not exactly in my set . But your father continued to see Willy pretty often . They took a great fancy to each other . Charlie , you know , was jovial - fond of private theatricals , too ; in short , they became great allies . Some years after , as ill - luck would have it , Charles Haughton , while selling off his Middlesex property , was in immediate want of L1,200 . He could get it on a bill , but not without security . His bills were already rather down in the market , and he had already exhausted most of the friends whose security was esteemed by accommodators any better than his own . In an evil hour he had learned that poor Willy had just L1,500 out upon mortgage ; and the money - lender , who was lawyer for the property on which the mortgage was , knew it too . It was on the interest of this L1,500 that Willy lived , having spent the rest of his little capital in settling his son as a clerk in a first - rate commercial house . Charles Haughton went down to shoot at the house where Willy was a guest - shot with him - drank with him - talked with him - proved to him , no doubt , that long before the three months were over the Middlesex property would be sold ; the bill taken up , Willy might trust to his Honour . Willy did trust . Like you , my dear Lionel , he had not moral courage to say ' No . ' Your father , I am certain , meant to repay him ; your father never in cold blood meant to defraud any human being ; but - your father gambled ! A debt of honour at piquet preceded the claim of a bill - discounter . The L1,200 were forestalled - your father was penniless . The money - lender came upon Willy . Sure that Charles Haughton would yet redeem his promise , Willy renewed the bill another three months on usurious terms ; those months over , he came to town to find your father hiding between four walls , unable to stir out for fear of arrest . Willy had no option but to pay the money ; and when your father knew that it was so paid , and that the usury had swallowed up the whole of Willy 's little capital , then , I say , I saw upon Charles Haughton 's once radiant face the saddest expression I ever saw on mortal man 's . And sure I am that all the joys your father ever knew as a man of pleasure were not worth the agony and remorse of that moment . I respect your emotion , Lionel , but you begin as your father began ; and if I had not told you this story , you might have ended as your father ended . "
232499	232502	232504	232505	Alban Morley	628	" Certainly , "
232511	232745	232491	232491	he	419	" certainly that villain - I mean William Losely , for villain he afterwards proved to be - had the sweetest , most forgiving temper ! He might have gone about to his kinsmen and friends denouncing Charles Haughton , and saying by what solemn promises he had been undone . But no ! such a story just at that moment would have crushed Charles Haughton 's last chance of ever holding up his head again , and Charles told me for it was through Charles that I knew the tale that Willy 's parting words to him were ' Do not fret , Charles - after all , my boy is now settled in life , and I am a cat with nine lives , and should fall on my legs if thrown out of a garret window . Do n't fret . ' So he kept the secret , and told the money - lender to hold his tongue . Poor Willy ! I never asked a rich friend to lend me money but once in my life . It was then I went to Guy Darrell , who was in full practice , and said to him : ' Lend me one thousand pounds . I may never repay you . ' ' Five thousand pounds , if you like it , ' said he . ' One will do . '
232746	233209	233217	233217	Lionel	419	" I took the money and sent it to Willy . Alas ! he returned it , writing word that ' Providence had been very kind to him ; he had just been appointed to a capital place , with a magnificent salary . ' The cat had fallen on its legs . He bade me comfort Haughton with that news . The money went back into Darrell 's pocket , and perhaps wandered thence to Charles Haughton 's creditors . Now for the appointment . At the country - house to which Willy had returned destitute , he had met a stranger no relation , who said to him : ' You live with these people - shoot their game - break in their horses - see to their farms - and they give you nothing ! You are no longer very young - you should lay by your little income , and add to it . Live with me and I will give you L300 a - year . I am parting with my steward - take his place , but be my friend . ' William Losely of course closed with the proposition . This gentleman , whose name was Gunston , I had known slightly in former times - people say I know everybody - a soured , bilious , melancholy , indolent , misanthropical old bachelor . With a splendid place universally admired , and a large estate universally envied , he lived much alone , ruminating on the bitterness of life and the nothingness of worldly blessings . Meeting Willy at the country - house to which , by some predestined relaxation of misanthropy , he had been decoyed - for the first time for years Mr. Gunston was heard to laugh . He said to himself , ' Here is a man who actually amuses me . ' William Losely contrived to give the misanthrope a new zest of existence ; and when he found that business could be made pleasant , the rich man conceived an interest in his own house , gardens , property . For the sake of William 's merry companionship , he would even ride over his farms , and actually carried a gun . Meanwhile , the property , I am told , was really well managed . Ah ! that fellow Willy was a born genius , and could have managed everybody 's affairs except his own . I heard of all this with pleasure - people say I hear everything - when one day a sporting man seizes me by the button at Tattersall 's - ' Do you know the news ? Will Losely is in prison on a charge ; of robbing his employer . ' "
233210	233215	232491	232491	he	419	" Robbing ! incredible ! "
233219	233249	232491	232491	he	419	" My dear Lionel , it was after hearing that news that I established as invariable my grand maxim , Nil admirari - never to be astonished at anything ! "
233250	233258	232491	232491	he	419	" But of course he was innocent ? "
233259	233413	232491	232491	he	419	" On the contrary , he confessed , - was committed ; pleaded guilty , and was transported ! People who knew Willy said that Gunston ought to have declined to drag him before a magistrate , or , at the subsequent trial , have abstained from giving evidence against him ; that Willy had been till then a faithful steward ; the whole proceeds of the estate lead passed through his hands ; he might , in transactions for timber , have cheated undetected to twice the amount of the alleged robbery ; it must have been a momentary aberration of reason ; the rich man should have let him off . But I side with the rich man . His last belief in his species was annihilated . He must have been inexorable . He could never be amused , never be interested again . He was inexorable and - vindictive . "
233414	233427	233562	233563	The Colonel	13877	" But what were the facts ? - what was the evidence ? "
233428	233561	233599	233599	his	13877	" Very little came out on the trial ; because , in pleading guilty , the court had merely to consider the evidence which had sufficed to commit him . The trial was scarcely noticed in the London papers . William Losely was not like a man known about town . His fame was confined to those who resorted to old - fashioned country - houses , chiefly single men , for the sake of sport . But stay . I felt such an interest in the case , that I made an abstract or praecis , not only of all that appeared , but all that I could learn of its leading circumstances . ' Tis a habit of mine , whenever any of my acquaintances embroil themselves with the Crown - "
233602	234050	234293	234294	the Colonel	13877	" One evening Mr. Gunston came to William Losely 's private apartment . Losely had two or three rooms appropriated to himself in one side of the house ; which was built in a quadrangle round a courtyard . When Losely opened his door to Mr. Gunston 's knock , it struck Mr. Gunston that his manner seemed confused . After some talk on general subjects , Losely said that he had occasion to go to London next morning for a few days on private business of his own . This annoyed Mr. Gunston . He observed that Losely 's absence just then would be inconvenient . He reminded him that a tradesman , who lived at a distance , was coming over the next day to be paid for a vinery he had lately erected , and on the charge for which there was a dispute . Could not Losely at least stay to settle it ? Losely replied , ' that he had already , by correspondence , adjusted the dispute , having suggested deductions which the tradesman had agreed to , and that Mr. Gunston would only have to give a cheque for the balance - viz . L270 . ' Thereon Mr. Gunston remarked : ' If you were not in the habit of paying my bills for me out of what you receive , you would know that I seldom give cheques . I certainly shall not give one now , for I have the money in the house . ' Losely observed ' That is a bad habit of yours keeping large sums in your own house . You may be robbed . ' Gunston answered ' Safer than lodging large sums in a country bank . Country banks break . My grandfather lost L1,000 by the failure of a country bank ; and my father , therefore , always took his payments in cash , remitting them to London from time to time as he went thither himself . I do the same , and I have never been robbed of a farthing that I know of . Who would rob a great house like this , full of menservants ? ' - ' That 's true , ' said Losely ; ' so if you are sure you have as much by you , you will pay the bill and have done with it . I shall be back before Sparks the builder comes to be paid for the new barn to the home farm - that will be L600 ; but I shall be taking money for timber next week . He can be paid out of that . "
234239	234291	234293	234294	the Colonel	13877	" After that , Losely became absent in manner , and seemed impatient to get rid of Mr. Gunston , hinting that he had the labour - book to look over , and some orders to write out for the bailiff , and that he should start early the next morning . "
234306	234467	234293	234294	the Colonel	13877	" Perhaps you will fancy that these dialogues are invented by me after the fashion of the ancient historians ? Not so . I give you the report of what passed , as Gunston repeated it verbatim ; and I suspect that his memory was pretty accurate . Well here Alban returned to his MS . Gunston left Willy , and went into his own study , where he took tea by himself . When his valet brought it in , he told the man that Mr. Losely was going to town early the next morning , and ordered the servant to see himself that coffee was served to Mr. Losely before he went . The servant observed ' that Mr. Losely had seemed much out of sorts lately , and that it was perhaps some unpleasant affair connected with the gentleman who had come to see him two days before . ' Gunston had not heard of such a visit .
234468	235756	236556	236556	his	628	" Losely had not mentioned it . When the servant retired , Gunston , thinking over Losely 's quotation respecting his money , resolved to ascertain what he had in his bureau . He opened it , examined the drawers , and found , stowed away in different places at different times , a larger sum than he had supposed - gold and notes to the amount of L1,975 , of which nearly L300 were in sovereigns . He smoothed the notes carefully ; and , for want of other occupation , and with a view of showing Losely that he could profit by a hint , he entered the numbers of the notes in his pocketbook , placed them all together in one drawer with the gold , relocked his bureau , and went shortly afterwards to bed . The next day Losely having gone in the morning the tradesman came to be paid for the vinery . Gunston went to his bureau , took out his notes , and found L250 were gone . He could hardly believe his senses . Had he made a mistake in counting ? No . There was his pocket book , the missing notes entered duly therein . Then he re - re - counted the sovereigns ; 142 were gone of them - nearly L400 in all thus abstracted . He refused at first to admit suspicion of Losely ; but , on interrogating his servants , the valet deposed , that he was disturbed about two o'clock in the morning by the bark of the house - dog , which was let loose of a night within the front courtyard of the house . Not apprehending robbers , but fearing the dog might also disturb his master , he got out of his window being on the ground - flour to pacify the animal ; that he then saw , in the opposite angle of the building , a light moving along the casement of the passage between Losely 's rooms and Mr. Gunston 's study . Surprised at this , at such an hour , he approached that part of the building and saw the light very faintly through the chinks in the shutters of the study . The passage windows had no shutters , being old - fashioned stone mullions . He waited by the wall a few minutes , when the light again reappeared in the passage ; and he saw a figure in a cloak , which , being in a peculiar colour , he recognised at once as Losely 's , pass rapidly along ; but before the figure had got half through the passage , the light was extinguished , and the servant could see no more . But so positive was he , from his recognition of the cloak , that the man was Losely , that he ceased to feel alarm or surprise , thinking , on reflection , that Losely , sitting up later than usual to transact business before his departure , might have gone into his employer 's study for any book or paper which he might have left there . The dog began barking again , and seemed anxious to get out of the courtyard to which he was confined ; but the servant gradually appeased him - went to bed , and somewhat overslept himself . When he awoke , he hastened to take the coffee into Losely 's room , but Losely was gone . Here there was another suspicious circumstance . It had been a question how the bureau had been opened , the key being safe in Gunston 's possession , and there being no sign of force . The lock was one of those rude old - fashioned ones which are very easily picked , but to which a modern key does not readily fit . In the passage there was found a long nail crooked at the end ; and that nail , the superintendent of the police who had been summoned had the wit to apply to the lock of the bureau , and it unlocked and re - locked it easily . It was clear that whoever had so shaped the nail could not have used such an instrument for the first time , and must be a practised picklock . That , one would suppose at first , might exonerate Losely ; but he was so clever a fellow at all mechanical contrivances that , coupled with the place of finding , the nail made greatly against him ; and still more so when some nails precisely similar were found on the chimney - piece of an inner room in his apartment , a room between that in which he had received Guarston and his bed - chamber , and used by him both as study and workshop . The nails , indeed , which were very long and narrow , with a Gothic ornamental head , were at once recognised by the carpenter on the estate as having been made according to Losely 's directions , for a garden bench to be placed in Gunston 's favourite walk , Gunston having remarked , some days before , that he should like a seat there , and Losely having undertaken to make one from a design by Pugin . Still loth to believe in Losely 's guilt , Gunston went to London with the police superintendent , the valet , and the neighbouring attorney . They had no difficulty in finding Losely ; he was at his son 's lodgings in the City , near the commercial house in which the son was a clerk . On being told of the robbery , he seemed at first unaffectedly surprised , evincing no fear . He was asked whether he had gone into the study about two o'clock in the morning . He said , ' No ; why should I ? ' The valet exclaimed : ' But I saw you - I knew you by that old grey cloak , with the red lining . Why , there it is now - on that chair yonder . I 'll swear it is the same . ' Losely then began to tremble visibly , and grew extremely pale . A question was next put to him as to the nail , but he secured quite stupefied , muttering : ' Good heavens ! the cloak - you mean to say you saw that cloak ? ' They searched his person - found on him some sovereigns , silver , and one bank - note for five pounds . The number on that bank - note corresponded with a number in Gunston 's pocket - book . He was asked to say where he got that five - pound note . He refused to answer . Gunston said : ' It is one of the notes stolen from me ! ' Losely cried fiercely : ' Take care what you say . How do you know ? ' Gunston replied : ' I took an account of the numbers of my notes on leaving your room . Here is the memorandum in my pocket - book - see - ' Losely looked , and fell back as if shot . Losely 's brother - in - law was in the room at the time , and he exclaimed , ' Oh , William ! you ca n't be guilty . You are the honestest fellow in the world . There must be some mistake , gentlemen . Where did you get the note , William - say ? '
235757	235853	235862	235863	the Colonel	13877	" Losely made no answer , but seemed lost in thought or stupefaction . ' I will go for your son , William - perhaps he may help to explain . ' Losely then seemed to wake up . ' My son ! what ! would you expose me before my son ? he 's gone into the country , as you know . What has he to do with it ? I took the notes - there - I have confessed . - Have done with it , ' - or words to that effect .
235854	235860	235862	235863	the Colonel	13877	" Nothing more of importance , "
235874	236365	236556	236556	his	628	" except to account for the crime . And here we come back to the money - lender . You remember the valet said that a gentleman had called on Losely two days before the robbery . This proved to be the identical bill - discounter to whom Losely had paid away his fortune . This person deposed that Losely had written to him some days before , stating that he wanted to borrow two or three hundred pounds , which he could repay by instalments out of his salary . What would be the terms ? The money - lender , having occasion to be in the neighbourhood , called to discuss the matter in person , and to ask if Losely could not get some other person to join in security - suggesting his brother - in - law . Losely replied that it was a favour he would never ask of any one ; that his brother - in - law had no pecuniary means beyond his salary as a senior clerk ; and , supposing that he Losely lost his place , which he might any day , if Gunston were displeased with him - how then could he be sure that his debt would not fall on the security ? Upon which the money - lender remarked that the precarious nature of his income was the very reason why a security was wanted . And Losely answered , ' Ay ; but you know that you incur that risk , and charge accordingly . Between me and you the debt and the hazard are mere matter of business , but between me and my security it would be a matter of honour . ' Finally the money - lender agreed to find the sum required , though asking very high terms . Losely said he would consider , and let him know . There the conversation ended . But Gunston inquired ' if Losely had ever had dealings with the money - lender before , and for what purpose it was likely he would leant the money now ; ' and the money - lender answered ' that probably Losely had some sporting or gaming speculations on the sly , for that it was to pay a gambling debt that he had joined Captain Haughton in a bill for L1,200 . ' And Gunston afterwards told a friend of mine that this it was that decided him to appear as a witness at the trial ; and you will observe that if Gunston had kept away there would have been no evidence sufficient to insure conviction . But Gunston considered that the man who could gamble away his whole fortune must be incorrigible , and that Losely , having concealed from him that he had become destitute by such transactions , must have been more than a mere security in a joint bill with Captain Haughton .
236366	236536	236556	236556	his	628	" Gunston could never have understood such an inconsistency in human nature , that the same man who broke open his bureau should have become responsible to the amount of his fortune for a debt of which he had not shared the discredit , and still less that such a man should , in case he had been so generously imprudent , have concealed his loss out of delicate tenderness for the character of the man to whom he owed his ruin . Therefore , in short , Gunston looked on his dishonest steward not as a man tempted by a sudden impulse in some moment of distress , at which a previous life was belied , but as a confirmed , dissimulating sharper , to whom public justice allowed no mercy . And thus , Lionel , William Losely was prosecuted , tried , and sentenced to seven years ' transportation . By pleading guilty , the term was probably made shorter than it otherwise would have been . "
236562	236602	236614	236614	Lionel	419	" I observe here that there are some queries entered as to the evidence against Losely . The solicitor whom , when I heard of his arrest , I engaged and sent down to the place on his behalf - "
236603	236611	236614	236614	Lionel	419	" You did ! Heaven reward you ! "
236616	236626	236556	236556	his	628	" But my father ? - where was he ? "
236627	236635	236614	236614	Lionel	419	" Then ? - in his grave . "
236646	237242	237474	237474	he	16014	" The lawyer , I say - a sharp fellow - was of opinion that if Losely had refused to plead guilty , he could have got him off in spite of his first confession - turned the suspicion against some one else . In the passage where the nail was picked up there was a door into the park . That door was found unbolted in the inside the next morning : a thief might therefore have thus entered and passed at once into the study . The nail was discovered close by the door ; the thief might have dropped it on putting out his light , which , by the valet 's account , he must have done when he was near the door in question , and required the light no more . Another circumstance in Losely 's favour : just outside the door , near a laurel - bush , was found the fag - end of one of those small rose - coloured wax - lights which are often placed in Lucifer - match boxes . If this had been used by the thief , it would seem as if , extinguishing the light before he stepped into the air , he very naturally jerked away the morsel of taper left , when , in the next moment , he was out of the house . But Losely would not have gone out of the house ; nor was he , nor any one about the premises , ever known to make use of that kind of taper , which would rather appertain to the fashionable fopperies of a London dandy . You will have observed , too , the valet had not seen the thief 's face . His testimony rested solely on the colours of a cloak , which , on cross - examination ; might have gone for nothing . The dog had barked before the light was seen . It was not the light that made him bark . He wished to get out of the courtyard ; that looked as if there were some stranger in the grounds beyond . Following up this clue , the lawyer ascertained that a strange man had been seen in the park towards the grey of the evening , walking up in the direction of the house . And here comes the strong point . At the railway station , about five miles from Mr. Gunston 's , a strange man had arrived just in time to take his place in the night - train from the north towards London , stopping there at four o'clock in the morning . The station - master remembered the stranger buying the ticket , but did not remark his appearance . The porter did , however , so far notice him as he hurried into a first - class carriage , that he said afterwards to the stationmaster : ' Why , that gentleman has a grey cloak just like Mr. Losely 's . If he had not been thinner and taller , I should have thought it was Mr. Losely . ' Well , Losely went to the same station the next morning , taking an early train , going thither on foot , with his carpet - bag in his hand ; and both the porter and station - master declared that he had no cloak on him at the time ; and as he got into a second - class carriage , the porter even said to him : "
237488	237701	237710	237710	Lionel	419	" The most damning fact against Losely , by the discovery in his possession of the L5 note , of which Mr. Gunston deposed to have taken the number , was certainly hard to get over ; still an ingenious lawyer might have thrown doubt on Gunstun 's testimony - a man confessedly so careless might have mistaken the number , c. The lawyer went , with these hints for defence , to see Losely himself in prison ; but Losely declined his help - became very angry - said that he would rather suffer death itself than have suspicion transferred to some innocent man ; and that , as to the cloak , it had been inside his carpet - bag . So you see , bad as he was , there was something inconsistently honourable left in him still . Poor Willy ! he would not even subpoena any of his old friends as to his general character . But even if he had , what could the Court do since he pleaded guilty ? And now dismiss that subject , it begins to pain me extremely . You were to speak to me about some one of the same name when my story was concluded . What is it ? "
237702	237708	237761	237761	Lionel	419	" I am so confused , "
237717	237760	237766	237767	Gentleman Waife	433	" that I can scarcely answer you - scarcely recollect myself . But - but - while you were describing this poor William Losely , his talent for mimicry and acting , I could not help thinking that I had seen him . "
237769	237776	237801	237801	he	628	" Can that be the man ? "
237796	237799	238059	238060	the Colonel	13877	" No , "
237803	238056	238059	238060	the Colonel	13877	" my dear boy . My William Losely could never become a strolling - player in a village fair . Besides , I have good reason to believe that Willy is well off ; probably made money in the colony by some lucky hit for when do you say you saw your stroller ? Five years ago ? Well , not very long before that date - perhaps a year or two - less than two years , I am sure - this eccentric rascal sent Mr. Gunston , the man who had transported him , L100 ! Gunston , you must know , feeling more than ever bored and hipped when he lost Willy , tried to divert himself by becoming director in some railway company . The company proved a bubble ; all turned their indignation on the one rich man who could pay where others cheated . Gunston was ruined - purse and character - fled to Calais ; and there , less than seven years ago , when in great distress , he received from poor Willy a kind , affectionate , forgiving letter , and L100 . I have this from Gunston 's nearest relation , to whom he told it , crying like a child . Willy gave no address ! but it is clear that at the time he must have been too well off to turn mountebank at your miserable exhibition . Poor , dear , rascally , infamous , big - hearted Willy , "
238062	238073	238079	238079	Lionel	419	" I wish to heaven he had only robbed me ! "
238074	238077	238079	238079	Lionel	419	" Sir , "
238081	238099	238112	238113	Alban Morley	628	" rely upon it , that man you described never robbed any one - ' tis impossible . "
238100	238110	238112	238113	Alban Morley	628	" No - very possible ! - human nature , "
238115	238220	238059	238060	the Colonel	13877	" And , after all , he really owed Gunston that L100 . For , out of the sum stolen , Gunston received anonymously , even before the trial , all the missing notes , minus about that L100 ; and Willy , therefore , owed Gunston the money , but not , perhaps , that kind , forgiving letter . Pass on - quick - the subject is worse than the gout . You have heard before the name of Losely - possibly . There are many members of the old Baronet 's family ; but when or where did you hear it ? "
238221	238292	238298	238299	the Colonel	13877	" I will tell you ; the man who holds the bill ah , the word sickens me reminded me when he called that I had seen him at my mother 's house - a chance acquaintance of hers - professed great regard for me - great admiration for Mr. Darrell - and then surprised me by asking if I had never heard Mr. Darrell speak of Mr. Jasper Losely . "
238293	238296	238298	238299	the Colonel	13877	" Jasper ! "
238301	238310	238059	238060	the Colonel	13877	" Jasper ! - well , go on . "
238311	238506	238298	238299	the Colonel	13877	" When I answered , ' No , ' Mr. Poole that is his name shook his head , and muttered : ' A sad affair - very bad business - I could do Mr. Darrell a great service if he would let me ; ' and then went on talking what seemed to me impertinent gibberish about ' family exposures ' and ' poverty making men desperate , ' and ' better compromise matters ; ' and finally wound up by begging me , ' if I loved Mr. Darrell , and wished to guard him from very great annoyance and suffering , to persuade him to give Mr. Poole an interview . ' Then he talked about his own character in the City , and so forth , and entreating me ' not to think of paying him till quite convenient ; that he would keep the bill in his desk ; nobody should know of it ; too happy to do me a favour ' - laid his card on the table , and went away . Tell me , should I say anything to Mr. Darrell about this or not ? "
238507	238554	238059	238060	the Colonel	13877	" Certainly not , till I have seen Mr. Poole myself . You have the money to pay him about you ? Give it to me , with Mr. Poole 's address ; I will call , and settle the matter . Just ring the bell . "
238559	238565	238602	238603	Alban Morley	628	" Order my horse round . "
238596	238600	238602	238603	Alban Morley	628	" Young man , "
238605	238688	238059	238060	the Colonel	13877	" I love you - I am interested in you - who would not be ? I have gone through this story ; put myself positively to pain - which I hate - solely for your good . You see what usury and money - lenders bring men to . Look me in the face ! Do you feel now that you would have the ' moral courage ' you before doubted of ? Have you done with such things for ever ? "
238689	238714	238602	238603	Alban Morley	628	" For ever , so help me Heaven ! The lesson has been cruel , but I do thank and bless you for it . "
238715	238943	239599	239600	Mr. Fossett	1040	" I knew you would . Mark this ! never treat money affairs with levity - MONEY is CHARACTER ! Stop . I have bared a father 's fault to a son . It was necessary - or even in his grave those faults might have revived in you . Now , I add this , if Charles Haughton - like you , handsome , high - spirited , favoured by men , spoiled by women - if Charles Haughton , on entering life , could have seen , in the mirror I have held up to you , the consequences of pledging the morrow to pay for to - day , Charles Haughton would have been shocked as you are , cured as you will be . Humbled by your own first error , be lenient to all his . Take up his life where I first knew it : when his heart was loyal , his lips truthful . Raze out the interval ; imagine that he gave birth to you in order to replace the leaves of existence we thus blot out and tear away . In every error avoided say , ' Thus the father warns the son ; ' in every honourable action , or hard self - sacrifice , say , ' Thus the son pays a father 's debt . ' "

239959	239999	240005	240007	the worthy man	7100	" it was very nice in old Fossett to bear it so meekly , never crying her up , nor showing her off to less fortunate parents - very nice in him - good sense - greatness of mind . "

The lady who is now your wife is entitled by my marriage - settlement to the reversion of a small fortune at my death ; nothing more from me is she likely to inherit . As I have no desire that she to whom I once gave the name of daughter should be dependent wholly on yourself for bread , my solicitor will inform you on what conditions I am willing , during my life , to pay the interest of the sum which will pass to your wife at my death . Sir , I return to your hands the letters that lady has addressed to me , and which , it is easy to perceive , were written at your dictation . No letter from her will I answer . Across my threshold her foot will never pass . Thus , sir , concludes all possible intercourse between you and myself ; what rests is between you and that gentleman . "
250411	250414	250416	250417	the lawyer	1389	" Sir , "
250419	250607	250708	250708	he	7861	" I will be quite frank with you . It is my wish , acting for Mr. Darrell , so to settle this sum of L10,000 on your wife , and any children she may bear you , as to place it out of your power to anticipate or dispose of it , even with Mrs. Hammond 's consent . If you part with that power , not at present a valuable one , you are entitled to compensation . I am prepared to make that compensation liberal . Perhaps you would prefer communicating with me through your own solicitor . But I should tell you , that the terms are more likely to be advantageous to you in proportion as negotiation is confined to us two . It might , for instance , be expedient to tell your solicitor that your true name I beg you a thousand pardons is not Hammond . That is a secret which , the more you can keep it to yourself , the better I think it will be for you . We have no wish to blab it out . "
250714	250839	250850	250850	he	7863	" I shall resume my family name whenever I choose it . If Mr. Darrell does not like his daughter to be called Mrs. Jasper Losely - or all the malignant tittle - tattle which my poor father 's unfortunate trial might provoke - he must , at least , ask me as a favour to retain the name I have temporarily adopted - a name in my family , sir . A Losely married a Hammond , I forget when - generations ago - you 'll see it in the Baronetage . My grandfather , Sir Julian , was not a crack lawyer , but he was a baronet of as good birth as any in the country ; and my father , sir "

252587	252771	252776	252776	Jasper	1052	" that it would be a great boon to himself and no disadvantage to Darrell if the principal were made over to him at once . He had been brought up originally to commerce . He had abjured all thoughts of resuming such vocation during his wife 's lifetime , out of that consideration for her family and ancient birth which motives of delicacy imposed . Now that the connection with Mr. Darrell was dissolved , it might be rather a relief than otherwise to that gentleman to know that a son - in - law so displeasing to him was finally settled , not only in a foreign land , but in a social sphere in which his very existence would soon be ignored by all who could remind Mr. Darrell that his daughter had once a husband . An occasion that might never occur again now presented itself . A trading firm at Paris , opulent , but unostentatiously quiet in its mercantile transactions , would accept him as a partner could he bring to it the additional capital of L10,000 . "

253165	253311	253340	253345	the solicitor who transmitted to him	7925	" Mr. Darrell having alluded to an equivalent for the L200 a year allowed to him , evidently implying that it was as disagreeable to Mr. Darrell to see that sum entered quarterly in his banker 's books , as it had been to see there the quarterly interest of the L10,000 , so Jasper might be excused in owning that he should prefer an equivalent . The commercial firm to which he was about to attach himself required a somewhat larger capital on his part than he had anticipated , c. , c. Without presuming to dictate any definite sum , he would observe that L1,500 or even L1000 would be of more avail to his views and objects in life than an annuity of L200 a year , which , being held only at will , was not susceptible of a temporary loan . "
253349	253461	253479	253479	He	512	" that an annuity held on his word was not to be calculated by Mr. Hammond 's notions of its value . That the L200 a year should therefore be placed on the same footing as the L500 a year that had been allowed on a capital of L10,000 ; that accordingly it might be held to represent a principal of L4,000 , for which he enclosed a cheque , begging Mr. Gotobed not only to make Mr. Hammond fully understand that there ended all possible accounts or communication between them , but never again to trouble him with any matters whatsoever in reference to affairs that were thus finally concluded . "
253493	253606	253856	253857	the porter	3111	" The firm he had entered , in the silk trade , was in the most flourishing state - an opportunity occurred to purchase a magnificent mulberry plantation in Provence , with all requisite magnanneries , c. , which would yield an immense increase of profit . That if , to insure him a share in this lucrative purchase , Mr. Darrell could accommodate him for a year with a loan of L2,000 or L3,000 , he sanguinely calculated on attaining so high a position in the commercial world as , though it could not render the recollection of his alliance more obtrusive to Mr. Darrell , would render it less humiliating . "
253867	253883	254474	254474	she	1072	" Monsieur Hammond was too reserved to communicate , he himself too incurious to inquire . "
254489	254528	254606	254606	Darrell	512	" I could forgive him if he beat me and beggared my friends ! but to beat my friends and to beggar me , - that is not the kind of love which makes the world go round ! "
254574	254605	254630	254630	he	512	" that he could not even communicate such applications to Mr. Darrell , and that he must peremptorily decline all further intercourse , epistolary or personal , with Mr. Hammond . "
254620	254627	255023	255023	he	628	" remote , unfriended , melancholy , "
255019	255022	255023	255023	he	628	" Stop ! "
255026	255048	255091	255091	Alban	628	" William Losely assured you of his own conviction that this strange tale was true . What proofs did he volunteer ? "
255049	255090	255091	255091	Alban	628	" Proofs ! Death , man , do you think that at such moments I was but a bloodless lawyer , to question and cross examine ? I could but bid the impostor leave the house which his feet polluted . "
255106	255110	255091	255091	Alban	628	" Poor Willy ! "
255114	255165	255171	255171	Darrell	512	" But , my dear friend , bear with me one moment . Suppose that , by the arts of this diabolical Jasper , the exchange really had been effected , and a child to your ancient line lived still , would it not be a solace , a comfort - "
255166	255169	255171	255171	Darrell	512	" Comfort ! "
255173	255327	255447	255447	himself	13877	" comfort in the perpetuation of infamy ! The line I promised my father to restore to its rank in the land , to be renewed in the grandchild of a felon ! - in the child of the yet viler sharper of a hell ! You , gentleman and soldier , call that thought - ' comfort ! ' O Alban ! - out on you ! Fie ! fie ! No ! - leave such a thought to the lips of a William Losely ! He indeed , clasping his hands , faltered forth some such word ; he seemed to count on my forlorn privation of kith and kindred - no heir to my wealth - no representative of my race - would I deprive myself of - ay - your very words - of a solace - a comfort ! He asked me , at least , to inquire . "
255328	255333	255171	255171	Darrell	512	" And you answered ? "
255334	255433	255444	255445	The Colonel	13877	" Answered so as to quell and crush in the bud all hopes in the success of so flagrant a falsehold - answered : ' Why inquire ? Know that , even if your tale were true , I have no heir , no representative , no descendant in the child of Jasper - the grandchild of William - Losely . I can at least leave my wealth to the son of Charles Haughton . True , Charles Haughton was a spendthrift , a gamester ; but he was neither a professional cheat nor a convicted felon . ' "
255434	255443	255468	255468	He	13877	" You said that - Oh , Darrell ! "
255477	255485	255500	255500	Darrell	512	" And how did William Losely reply ? "
255486	255499	255556	255556	Darrell	512	" He made no reply - he skulked away without a word . "
255551	255554	255556	255556	Darrell	512	" And , "
255558	255618	255624	255624	Darrell	512	" the man , finding it thus impossible to dupe my reason , had the inconceivable meanness to apply to me for alms . I could not better show the disdain in which I held himself and his story than in recognising his plea as a mendicant . I threw my purse at his feet , and so left him .
255619	255622	255624	255624	Darrell	512	" But , "
255633	255811	255821	255821	Alban	628	" but wild and monstrous as the story was , still the idea that it MIGHT be true - a supposition which derived its sole strength from the character of Jasper Losely - from the interest he had in the supposed death of a child that alone stood between himself and the money he longed to grasp - an interest which ceased when the money itself was gone , or rather changed into the counter - interest of proving a life that , he thought , would re - establish a hold on me - still , I say , an idea that the story might be true would force itself on my fears , and if so , though my resolution never to acknowledge the child of Jasper Losely as a representative , or even as a daughter , of my house , would of course be immovable - yet it would become my duty to see that her infancy was sheltered , her childhood reared , her youth guarded , her existence amply provided for . "
255812	255819	255821	255821	Alban	628	" Right - your plain duty , "
255824	255867	255624	255624	Darrell	512	" Intricate sometimes are the obligations imposed on us as gentlemen ; ' noblesse oblige ' is a motto which involves puzzles for a casuist ; but our duties as men are plain - the idea very properly haunted you - and - "
255868	256361	256388	256388	Darrell	512	" And I hastened to exorcise the spectre . I left England - I went to the French town in which poor Matilda died - I could not , of course , make formal or avowed inquiries of a nature to raise into importance the very conspiracy if conspiracy there were which threatened me . But I saw the physician who had attended both my daughter and her child - I sought those who had seen them both when living - seen them both when dead . The doubt on my mind was dispelled - not a pretext left for my own self - torment . The only person needful in evidence whom I failed to see was the nurse to whom the infant had been sent . She lived in a village some miles from the town - I called at her house - she was out . I left word I should call the next day - I did so - she had absconded . I might , doubtless , have traced her , but to what end if she were merely Jasper 's minion and tool ? Did not her very flight prove her guilt and her terror ? Indirectly I inquired into her antecedents and character . The inquiry opened a field of conjecture , from which I hastened to turn my eyes . This woman had a sister who had been in the service of Gabrielle Desmarets , and Gabrielle Desmarets had been in the neighbourhood during my poor daughter 's life - time , and just after my daughter 's death . And the nurse had had two infants under her charge ; the nurse had removed with one of them to Paris - and Gabrielle Desmarets lived in Paris - and , O Alban , if there be really in flesh and life a child by Jasper Losely , to be forced upon my purse or my pity - is it his child , not by the ill - fated Matilda , but by the vile woman for whom Matilda , even in the first year of wedlock , was deserted ? Conceive how credulity itself would shrink appalled from the horrible snare ! - I to acknowledge , adopt , proclaim as the last of the Darrells , the adulterous offspring of a Jasper Losely and a Gabrielle Desmarets ! - or , when I am in my grave , some claim advanced upon the sum settled by my marriage articles on Matilda 's issue , and which , if a child survived , could not have been legally transferred to its father - a claim with witnesses suborned - a claim that might be fraudulently established - a claim that would leave the representative - not indeed of my lands and wealth , but , more precious far , of my lineage and blood - in - in the person of - of - "
256381	256386	256388	256388	Darrell	512	" It is nothing , "
256392	256414	255821	255821	Alban	628	" and , ill or well , I must finish this subject now , so that we need not reopen it . "
256415	256554	256388	256388	Darrell	512	" I remained abroad , as you know , for some years . During that time two or three letters from Jasper Losely were forwarded to me ; the latest in date more insolent than all preceding ones . It contained demands as if they were rights , and insinuated threats of public exposure , reflecting on myself and my pride : ' He was my son - in - law after all , and if he came to disgrace , the world should know the tie . ' Enough . This is all I knew until the man who now , it seems , thrusts himself forward as Jasper Losely 's friend or agent , spoke to me the other night at Mrs. Haughton 's . That man you have seen , and you say that he - "
256555	256800	255821	255821	Alban	628	" Represents Jasper 's poverty as extreme ; his temper unscrupulous and desperate ; that he is capable of any amount of scandal or violence . It seems that though at Paris he has Poole believes still preserved the name of Hammond , yet that in England he has resumed that of Losely ; and seems by Poole 's date of the time at which he , Poole , made Jasper 's acquaintance , to have done so after his baffled attempt on you at Fawley - whether in so doing he intimated the commencement of hostilities , or whether , as is more likely , the sharper finds it convenient to have one name in one country , and one in another , ' tis useless to inquire ; enough that the identity between the Hammond who married poor Matilda , and the Jasper Losely whose father was transported , that unscrupulous rogue has no longer any care to conceal . It is true that the revelation of this identity would now be of slight moment to a man of the world - as thick - skinned as myself , for instance ; but to you it would be disagreeable - there is no denying that - and therefore , in short , when Mr. Poole advises a compromise , by which Jasper could be secured from want and yourself from annoyance , I am of the same opinion as Mr. Poole is . "
256801	256805	256388	256388	Darrell	512	" You are ? "
256806	257091	257097	257097	Darrell	512	" Certainly . My dear Darrell , if in your secret heart there was something so galling in the thought that the man who had married your daughter , though without your consent , was not merely the commonplace adventurer whom the world supposed , but the son of that poor dear - I mean that rascal who was transported , Jasper , too , himself a cheat and a sharper - if this galled you so , that you have concealed the true facts from myself , your oldest friend , till this day - if it has cost you even now so sharp a pang to divulge the true name of that Mr. Hammond , whom our society never saw , whom even gossip has forgotten in connection with yourself - how intolerable would be your suffering to have this man watching for you in the streets , some wretched girl in his hand , and crying out , ' A penny for your son - in - law and your grandchild ! ' Pardon me - I must be blunt . You can give him to the police - send him to the treadmill . Does that mend the matter ? Or , worse still , suppose the man commits some crime that fills all the newspapers with his life and adventures , including of course his runaway marriage with the famous Guy Darrell 's heiress - no one would blame you , no one respect you less ; but do not tell me that you would not be glad to save your daughter 's name from being coupled with such a miscreant 's at the price of half your fortune . "
257092	257095	257097	257097	Darrell	512	" Alban ' "
257101	257211	256388	256388	Darrell	512	" you can say nothing on this score that has not been considered by myself . But the man has so placed the matter , that honour itself forbids me to bargain with him for the price of my name . So long as he threatens , I can not buy off a threat ; so long as he persists in a story by which he would establish a claim on me on behalf of a child whom I have every motive as well as every reason to disown as inheriting my blood - whatever I bestowed on himself would seem like hush - money to suppress that claim . "
257212	257341	257355	257355	Darrell	512	" Of course - I understand , and entirely agree with you . But if the man retract all threats , confess his imposture in respect to this pretended offspring , and consent to retire for life to a distant colony , upon an annuity that may suffice for his wants , but leave no surplus beyond , to render more glaring his vices , or more effective his powers of evil ; if this could be arranged between Mr. Poole and myself , I think that your peace might be permanently secured without the slightest sacrifice of honour . Will you leave the matter in my hands on this assurance - that I will not give this person a farthing except on the conditions I have premised ? "
257342	257353	257355	257355	Darrell	512	" On these conditions , yes , and most gratefully , "
257357	257387	257405	257406	the Colonel	628	" Do what you will ; but one favour more : never again speak to me unless absolutely compelled in reference to this dark portion of my inner life . "
257414	257460	257472	257472	Darrell	512	" Darrell , more than ever now do I see that the new house at Fawley , so long suspended , must be finished . Marry again you must ! - you can never banish old remembrances unless you can supplant them by fresh hopes . "
257461	257470	257405	257406	the Colonel	628	" I feel it - I know it , "
257494	257494	257500	257500	Alban	628	"
257495	257498	257500	257500	Alban	628	" Ah ! "
257502	257533	258058	258059	the bravo	4678	" the remembrance of his former conjugal life ! - a remembrance which might well make the youngest and the boldest Benedict shrink from the hazard of a similar experiment . "
258046	258056	258058	258059	the bravo	4678	" I am not so young as I was , "
258061	258225	258231	258231	Poole	790	" I do n't speak of years , but feeling . I have not the same energy ; once I had high spirits - they are broken ; once I had hope - I have none : I am not up to exertion ; I have got into lazy habits . To go into new scenes , form new plans , live in a horrid raw new world , everybody round me bustling and pushing - No ! that may suit your thin dapper light Hop - o'-my - thumbs ! Look at me ! See how I have increased in weight the last five years - all solid bone and muscle . I defy any four draymen to move me an inch if I am not in the mind to it ; and to be blown off to the antipodes as if I were the down of a pestilent thistle , I am not in the mind for that , Dolly Poole ! "
258226	258229	258231	258231	Poole	790	" Hum ! "
258237	258278	258321	258322	the bravo	4678	" This is funny talk . You always were a funny fellow . But I am quite sure , from Colonel Morley 's decided manner , that you can get nothing from Darrell if you choose to remain in England . "
258279	258319	258363	258363	Poole	790	" Well , when I have nothing else left , I may go to Darrell myself , and have that matter out with him . At present I am not up to it . Dolly , do n't bore ! "
258358	258361	258363	258363	Poole	790	" Bore ! "
258373	258395	258231	258231	Poole	790	" But I should have thought no subject could bore you less than the consideration of how you are to live ? "
258396	258419	258425	258425	Poole	790	" Why , Dolly , I have learned to be easily contented , and you see at present I live upon you . "
258420	258423	258425	258425	Poole	790	" Yes , "
258427	258462	258231	258231	Poole	790	" but that ca n't go on for ever ; and , besides , you promised that you would leave me in peace as soon as I had got Darrell to provide for you . "
258463	258918	259365	259365	he	512	" So I will . Zounds , sir , do you doubt my word ? So I will . But I do n't call exile ' a provision ' - Basta ! I understand from you that Colonel Morley offers to restore the niggardly L200 a year Darrell formerly allowed to me , to be paid monthly or weekly , through some agent in Van Diemen 's Land , or some such uncomfortable half - way house to Eternity , that was not even in the Atlas when I studied geography at school . But L200 a year is exactly my income in England , paid weekly too , by your agreeable self , with whom it is a pleasure to talk over old times . Therefore that proposal is out of the question . Tell Colonel Morley , with my compliments , that if he will double the sum , and leave me to spend it where I please , I scorn haggling , and say ' done . ' And as to the girl , since I can not find her which , on penalty of being threshed to a mummy , you will take care not to let out , I would agree to leave Mr. Darrell free to disown her . But are you such a dolt as not to see that I put the ace of trumps on my adversary 's pitiful deuce , if I depose that my own child is not my own child , when all I get for it is what I equally get out of you , with my ace of trumps still in my hands ? Basta ! - I say again Basta ! It is evidently an object to Darrell to get rid of all fear that Sophy should ever pounce upon him tooth and claw : if he be so convinced that she is not his daughter 's child , why make a point of my saying that I told him a fib , when I said she was ? Evidently , too , he is afraid of my power to harass and annoy him ; or why make it a point that I shall only nibble his cheese in a trap at the world 's end , stared at by bushmen , and wombats , and rattlesnakes , and alligators , and other American citizens or British settlers ! L200 a year , and my wife 's father a millionaire ! The offer is an insult . Ponder this : put on the screw ; make them come to terms which I can do them the honour to accept ; meanwhile , I will trouble you for my four sovereigns . "
259376	259419	259428	259428	Poole	790	" Tell Colonel Morley , however , that if negotiations fail , I shall not fail , sooner or later , to argue my view of the points in dispute with my kind father - in - law , and in person . "
259420	259426	259428	259428	Poole	790	" Yes , hang it ! "
259432	259444	259450	259450	Jasper	721	" go and see Darrell yourself . He is easily found . "
259445	259448	259457	259457	his	512	" Ay , "
259462	259696	259858	259858	Poole	790	" Ay ; some day or other it may come to that . I would rather not , if possible . I might not keep my temper . It is not merely a matter of money between us , if we two meet . There are affronts to efface . Banished his house like a mangy dog - treated by a jackanapes lawyer like the dirt in the kennel ! The Loselys , I suspect , would have looked down on the Darrells fifty years ago ; and what if my father was born out of wedlock , is the blood not the same ? Does the breed dwindle down for want of a gold ring and priest ? Look at me . No ; not what I now am ; not even as you saw me five years ago ; but as I leapt into youth ! Was I born to cast sums and nib pens as a City clerk ? Aha , my poor father , you were wrong there ! Blood will out ! Mad devil , indeed , is a racer in a citizen 's gig ! Spavined , and wind - galled , and foundered - let the brute go at last to the knockers ; but by his eye , and his pluck , and his bone , the brute shows the stock that he came from ! "
259853	259856	259858	259858	Poole	790	" Humph ! "
259864	259961	259858	259858	Poole	790	" If Darrell was as uncivil to you as he was to me , I do n't wonder that you owe him a grudge . But even if you do lose temper in seeing him , it might rather do good than not . You can make yourself cursedly unpleasant if you choose it ; and perhaps you will have a better chance of getting your own terms if they see you can bite as well as bark ! Set at Darrell , and worry him ; it is not fair to worry nobody but me ! "
259962	260128	259858	259858	Poole	790	" Dolly , do n't bluster ! If I could stand at his door , or stop him in the streets , with the girl in my hand , your advice would be judicious . The world would not care for a row between a rich man and a penniless son - in - law . But an interesting young lady , who calls him grandfather , and falls at his knees , - he could not send her to hard labour ; and if he does not believe in her birth , let the thing but just get into the newspapers , and there are plenty who will : and I should be in a very different position for treating . ' Tis just because , if I meet Darrell again , I do n't wish that again it should be all bark and no bite , that I postpone the interview . All your own laziness - exert yourself and find the girl . "
260129	260171	259858	259858	Poole	790	" But I ca n't find the girl , and you know it . And I tell you what , Mr. Losely , Colonel Morley , who is a very shrewd man , does not believe in the girl 's existence . "
260172	260241	260425	260426	the Colonel	13877	" Does not he ! I begin to doubt it myself . But , at all events , you ca n't doubt of mine , and I am grateful for yours ; and since you have given me the trouble of coming here to no purpose , I may as well take the next week 's pay in advance - four sovereigns if you please , Dolly Poole . "
260374	260423	260504	260505	an adviser	8051	" that his interference was at an end ; that if Mr. Losely , either through himself , or through Mr. Poole , or any one else , presumed to address Mr. Darrell direct , the offer previously made would be peremptorily and irrevocably withdrawn . I myself , "
260506	260518	260752	260752	Darrell	512	" - a compliment which by no means consoled the miserable Poole .
260746	260750	260788	260788	Darrell	512	" Well met , "
260782	260786	260788	260788	Darrell	512	" Well met , "
260801	260859	260791	260792	the Colonel	13877	" Pray walk with me as far as the New Road . I have promised Lionel to visit the studio of an artist friend of his , in whom he chooses to find a Raffaele , and in whom I suppose , at the price of truth , I shall be urbanely compelled to compliment a dauber . "
260860	260868	260788	260788	Darrell	512	" Do you speak of Frank Vance ? "
260869	260873	260791	260792	the Colonel	13877	" The same . "
260874	261030	261036	261036	Darrell	512	" You could not visit a worthier man , nor compliment a more promising artist . Vance is one of the few who unite gusto and patience , fancy and brushwork . His female heads , in especial , are exquisite , though they are all , I confess , too much like one another . The man himself is a thoroughly fine fellow . He has been much made of in good society , and remains unspoiled . You will find his manner rather off - hand , the reverse of shy ; partly , perhaps , because he has in himself the racy freshness and boldness which he gives to his colours ; partly , perhaps , also , because he has in his art the self - esteem that patricians take from their pedigree , and shakes a duke by the hand to prevent the duke holding out to him a finger . "
261031	261034	261036	261036	Darrell	512	" Good , "
261045	261073	260791	260792	the Colonel	13877	" Being shy myself , I like men who meet one half - way . I see that we shall be at our ease with each other . "
261074	261111	261036	261036	Darrell	512	" And perhaps still more ' when I tell you that he is connected with an old Eton friend of ours , and deriving no great benefit from that connection ; you remember poor Sidney Branthwaite ? "
261112	261176	260791	260792	the Colonel	13877	" To be sure . He and I were great friends at Eton somewhat in the same position of pride and poverty . Of all the boys in the school we two had the least pocket - money . Poor Branthwaite ! I lost sight of him afterwards . He went into the Church , got only a curacy , and died young . "
261177	261194	261036	261036	Darrell	512	" And left a son , poorer than himself , who married Frank Vance 's sister . "
261195	261216	260791	260792	the Colonel	13877	" You do n't say so . The Branthwaites were of good old family ; what is Mr. Vance 's ? "
261217	261285	261036	261036	Darrell	512	" Respectable enough . Vance 's father was one of those clever men who have too many strings to their bow . He , too , was a painter ; but he was also a man of letters , in a sort of a way - had a share in a journal , in which he wrote Criticisms on the Fine Arts . A musical composer , too .
261286	261551	261572	261572	Darrell	512	" Rather a fine gentleman , I suspect , with a wife who was rather a fine lady . Their house was much frequented by artists and literary men : old Vance , in short , was hospitable - his wife extravagant . Believing that posterity would do that justice to his pictures which his contemporaries refused , Vance left to his family no other provision . After selling his pictures and paying his debts , there was just enough left to bury him . Fortunately , Sir - - - - , the great painter of that day , had already conceived a liking to Frank Vance - then a mere boy - who had shown genius from an infant , as all true artists do . Sir - - - - took him into his studio and gave him lessons . It would have been unlike Sir - - - - , who was open - hearted but close - fisted , to give anything else . But the boy contrived to support his mother and sister . That fellow , who is now as arrogant a stickler for the dignity of art as you or my Lord Chancellor may be for that of the bar , stooped then to deal clandestinely with fancy shops , and imitate Watteau on fans . I have two hand - screens that he painted for a shop in Rathbone Place . I suppose he may have got ten shillings for them , and now any admirer of Frank 's would give L100 apiece for them . "
261552	261570	261572	261572	Darrell	512	" That is the true soul in which genius lodges , and out of which fire springs , "
261575	261625	261036	261036	Darrell	512	" Give me the fire that lurks in the flint , and answers by light the stroke of the hard steel . I 'm glad Lionel has won a friend in such a man . Sidney Branthwaite 's son married Vance 's sister - after Vance had won reputation ? "
261626	261793	261572	261572	Darrell	512	" No ; while Vance was still a boy . Young Arthur Branthwaite was an orphan . If he had any living relations , they were too poor to assist him . He wrote poetry much praised by the critics they deserve to be hanged , those critics ! - scribbled , I suppose , in old Vance 's journal ; saw Mary Vance a little before her father died ; fell in love with her ; and on the strength of a volume of verse , in which the critics all solemnly deposed to his surpassing riches - of imagination , rushed to the altar , and sacrificed a wife to the Muses ! Those villanous critics will have a dark account to render in the next world ! Poor Arthur Branthwaite ! For the sake of our old friend , his father , I bought a copy of his little volume . Little as the volume was , I could not read it through . "
261794	261801	261036	261036	Darrell	512	" What ! - below contempt ? "
261802	262102	262265	262266	the artist	1502	" On the contrary , above comprehension ! All poetry praised by critics now - a - days is as hard to understand as a hieroglyphic . I own a weakness for Pope and common sense . I could keep up with our age as far as Byron ; after him I was thrown out . However , Arthur was declared by the critics to be a great improvement on Byron - more ' poetical in form ' - more ' aesthetically artistic ' - more ' objective ' or ' subjective ' I am sure I forget which ; but it was one or the other , nonsensical , and not English in his views of man and nature . Very possibly . All I know is - I bought the poems , but could not read them ; the critics read them , but did not buy . All that Frank Vance could make by painting hand - screens and fans and album - scraps , he sent , I believe , to the poor poet ; but I fear it did not suffice . Arthur , I suspect , must have been publishing another volume on his own account . I saw a Monody on something or other , by Arthur Branthwaite , advertised , and no doubt Frank 's fans and hand - screens must have melted into the printer 's bill . But the Monody never appeared : the poet died , his young wife too . Frank Vance remains a bachelor , and sneers at gentility - abhors poets - is insulted if you promise posthumous fame - gets the best price he can for his pictures - and is proud to be thought a miser . Here we are at his door . "
262257	262263	262281	262281	Lionel	419	" And that is Lionel , "
262276	262279	262288	262288	Darrell	512	" Pish ! "
262290	262310	262318	262318	Darrell	512	" This is the Sophy we have failed to find , sir - is it not a lovely face ? "
262311	262316	262318	262318	Darrell	512	" It is indeed , "
262320	262353	262365	262365	Lionel	419	" But that nameless refinement in expression - that arch yet tender elegance in the simple , watchful attitude - these , Mr. Vance , must be your additions to the original . "
262354	262363	262365	262365	Lionel	419	" No , I assure you , sir , "
262367	262400	262410	262410	Vance	425	" besides that elegance , that refinement , there was a delicacy in the look and air of that child to which Vance failed to do justice . Own it , Frank . "
262401	262408	262410	262410	Vance	425	" Reassure yourself , Mr. Darrell , "
262412	262465	262466	262466	DARRELL	512	" of any fears which Lionel 's enthusiasm might excite . He tells me that Titania is in America ; yet , after all , I would rather he saw her again - no cure for love at first sight like a second sight of the beloved object after a long absence . "
262471	262486	262487	262488	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" A hazardous remedy - it might kill , if it did not cure . "
262491	262511	262512	262512	LIONEL	419	" I suspect , from Vance 's manner , that he has tested its efficacy on his own person . "
262515	262533	262580	262581	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" NO , mon Colonel - I 'll answer for Vance . He in love ! Never . "
262584	262751	262752	262752	DARRELL	512	" Then all the more credit to Vance for his intuitive perception of philosophical truth . Suppose , my dear Lionel , that we light , one idle day , on a beautiful novel , a glowing romance - suppose that , by chance , we are torn from the book in the middle of the interest - we remain under the spell of the illusion - we recall the scenes - we try to guess what should have been the sequel - we think that no romance ever was so captivating , simply because we were not allowed to conclude it . Well , if , some years afterwards , the romance fall again in our way , and we open at the page where we left off , we cry , in the maturity of our sober judgment , ' Mawkish stuff ! - is this the same thing that I once thought so beautiful ? - how one 's tastes do alter ! ' "
262755	262770	262771	262771	LIONEL	419	" Does it not depend on the age in which one began the romance ? "
262774	262797	262798	262798	VANCE	425	" Rather , let me think , sir , upon the real depth of the interest - the true beauty of the - "
262802	262968	262982	262983	the Colonel	13877	" Heroine ? - Not at all , Lionel . I once fell in love - incredible as it may seem to you - nine years ago last January . I was too poor then to aspire to any young lady 's hand - therefore I did not tell my love , but ' let concealment , ' et cetera , et cetera . She went away with her mamma to complete her education on the Continent . I remained ' Patience on a monument . ' She was always before my eyes - the slenderest , shyest creature just eighteen . I never had an idea that she could grow any older , less slender , or less shy . Well , four years afterwards just before we made our excursion into Surrey , Lionel , she returned to England , still unmarried . I went to a party at which I knew she was to be - saw her , and was cured . "
262969	262980	262987	262987	VANCE	425	" Bad case of small - pox , or what ? "
262989	263185	262987	262987	VANCE	425	" Nay ; everybody said she was extremely improved - that was the mischief - she had improved herself out of my fancy . I had been faithful as wax to one settled impression , and when I saw a fine , full - formed , young Frenchified lady , quite at her ease , armed with eyeglass and bouquet and bustle , away went my dream of the slim blushing maiden . The Colonel is quite right , Lionel ; the romance once suspended , ' tis a haunting remembrance till thrown again in our way , but complete disillusion if we try to renew it ; though I swear that in my case the interest was deep , and the heroine improved in her beauty . So with you and that dear little creature . See her again , and you 'll tease , me no more to give you that portrait of Titania at watch over Bottom 's soft slumbers . All a Midsummer Night 's Dream , Lionel . Titania fades back into the arms of Oberon , and would not be Titania if you could make her - Mrs. Bottom . "
263208	263216	263226	263226	Darrell	512	" WHAT WILL HE DO WITH IT ? "
263217	263224	263229	263229	he	512	" I am delighted with Vance , "
263242	263273	263282	263283	the Colonel	13877	" His is not one of those meagre intellects which have nothing to spare out of the professional line . He has humour . Humour - strength 's rich superfluity . "
263274	263280	263282	263283	the Colonel	13877	" I like your definition , "
263285	263318	263335	263335	Darrell	512	" And humour in Vance , though fantastic , is not without subtlety . There was much real kindness in his obvious design to quiz Lionel out of that silly enthusiasm for - "
263319	263333	263335	263335	Darrell	512	" For a pretty child , reared up to be a strolling player , "
263337	263393	263394	263395	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Do n't call it silly enthusiasm . I call it chivalrous compassion . Were it other than compassion , it would not be enthusiasm - it would be degradation . But do you believe , then , that Vance 's confession of first love , and its cure , was but a whimsical invention ? "
263398	263435	263436	263436	DARRELL	512	" Not so . Many a grave truth is spoken jestingly . I have no doubt that , allowing for the pardonable exaggeration of a raconteur , Vance was narrating an episode in his own life . "
263439	263467	263468	263469	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Do you think that a grown man , who has ever really felt love , can make a jest of it , and to mere acquaintances ? "
263472	263524	263525	263525	DARRELL	512	" Yes ; if he be so thoroughly cured , that he has made a jest of it to himself . And the more lightly he speaks of it , perhaps the more solemnly at one time he felt it . Levity is his revenge on the passion that fooled him . "
263528	263561	263570	263571	the Colonel	13877	" You are evidently an experienced philosopher in the lore of such folly . ' Consultas insapientis sapientiae . ' Yet I can scarcely believe that you have ever been in love . "
263562	263568	263599	263600	the Colonel	13877	" Yes , I have , "
263574	263597	263599	263600	the Colonel	13877	" and very often ! Everybody at my age has - except yourself . So like a man 's observation , that , "
263605	263620	263621	263621	DARRELL	512	" No man ever thinks another man capable of a profound and romantic sentiment ! "
263624	263690	263691	263692	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" True ; I own my shallow fault , and beg you ten thousand pardons . So then you really believe , from your own experience , that there is much in Vance 's theory and your own very happy illustration ? Could we , after many years , turn back to the romance at the page at which we left off , we should - "
263695	263722	263723	263723	DARRELL	512	" Not care a straw to read on ! Certainly , half the peculiar charm of a person beloved must be ascribed to locality and circumstance . "
263726	263734	263735	263736	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" I do n't quite understand you . "
263739	263896	263897	263897	DARRELL	512	" Then , as you liked my former illustration , I will explain myself by another one more homely . In a room to which you are accustomed there is a piece of furniture , or an ornament , which so exactly suits the place that you say : ' The prettiest thing I ever saw ! ' You go away - you return - the piece of furniture or the ornament has been moved into another room . You see it there , and you say : ' Bless me , is that the thing I so much admired ! ' The strange room does not suit it - losing its old associations and accessories , it has lost its charm . So it is with human beings - seen in one place , the place would be nothing without them ; seen in another , the place without them would be all the better ! "
263900	263953	263965	263966	Colonel Morley	628	" There are some puzzles in life which resemble the riddles a child asks you to solve . Your imagination can not descend low enough for the right guess . Yet , when you are told , you are obliged to say , ' How clever ! ' Man lives to learn . "
263954	263963	263965	263966	Colonel Morley	628	" Since you have arrived at that conviction , "
263975	264033	264039	264039	Darrell	512	" I hope that you will rest satisfied with the experiences of Vance and myself ; and that if you have a mind to propose to one of the young ladies whose merits we have already discussed , you will not deem it necessary to try what effect a prolonged absence might produce on your good resolution . "
264034	264037	264039	264039	Darrell	512	" No ! "
264045	264058	263965	263966	Colonel Morley	628	" Before three days are over my mind shall be made up . "
264059	264075	264039	264039	Darrell	512	" Bravo ! - as to whom of the three you would ask in marriage ? "
264076	264098	263965	263966	Colonel Morley	628	" Or as to the idea of ever marrying again . Adieu , I am going to knock at that door . "
264099	264122	264039	264039	Darrell	512	" Mr. Vyvyan 's ! Ah , is it so , indeed ? Verily , you are a true Dare - all . "
264123	264160	264169	264170	the Colonel	13877	" Do not be alarmed . I go afterwards to an exhibition with Lady Adela , and I dine with the Carr Viponts . My choice is not yet made , and my hand still free . "
264161	264167	264169	264170	the Colonel	13877	" His hand still free ! "
264177	264194	264408	264408	he	512	" Yes - but three days hence - O - What will he do with it ? "
264401	264406	264408	264408	he	512	" The innocent child , "
264424	264465	264466	264466	Mills	571	" He began to pace the room with his habitual restlessness when in solitary thought - often stopping - often sighing heavily . At length his face cleared - his lips became firmly set . He summoned his favourite servant . "
264468	264472	264528	264528	I	0	" said he , "
264537	264537	264647	264647	he	512	"
264632	264645	264647	264647	he	512	" Back again - back again - and to leave no more ! "
264652	264658	265457	265457	my	0	" Spes et Fortuna valete ! "
265479	265496	265549	265549	I	0	" all that should accompany old age - honour , love , obedience , troops of friends "
265543	265548	265549	265549	I	0	" Vive , vale ; "
265554	265559	265577	265577	you	8112	" Sis memor mei . "
265581	265584	265922	265923	the Colonel	13877	" painful subjects "
265912	265920	265949	265949	he	13877	" That mischievous kitten , Flora Vyvyan , "
265925	265943	266004	266005	the Colonel	13877	" I always felt that she had the claws of a tigress under her patte de velours ! "
265992	266002	266018	266019	Mr. Vyvyan	1088	" So Darrell has left town for the season , "
266013	266016	266018	266019	Mr. Vyvyan	1088	" Yes , "
266021	266039	266045	266046	the Colonel	13877	" I had a note from him this morning to say he had renounced all hope of - "
266040	266043	266018	266019	Mr. Vyvyan	1088	" What ? "
266048	266092	266098	266099	the Colonel	13877	" Joining us in Switzerland . I am so sorry . Flora still more sorry . She is accustomed to have her own way , and she had set her heart on hearing Darrell read ' Manfred ' in sight of the Jungfrau ! "
266093	266096	266098	266099	the Colonel	13877	" Um ! "
266101	266153	266168	266168	Flora	975	" What might be sport to her might be death to him . A man at his age is not too old to fall in love with a young lady of hers . But he is too old not to be extremely ridiculous to such a young lady if he does . "
266154	266160	266211	266212	the Colonel	13877	" Colonel Morley - Fie ! "
266199	266209	266098	266099	the Colonel	13877	" What have I said to merit your rebuke ? "
266215	266230	266239	266240	Mr. Vyvyan	1088	" Said ! coupled the thought of ridicule with the name of Mr. Darrell ! "
266231	266237	266239	266240	Mr. Vyvyan	1088	" Take care , Morley , "
266244	266318	266361	266361	Vyvyan	975	" Flora is positively superstitious in her respect for Guy Darrell ; and you can not offend her more than by implying that he is mortal . Nay , child , it is very natural . Quite apart from his fame , there is something in that man 's familiar talk , or rather , perhaps , in the very sound of his voice , which makes most other society seem flat and insipid .
266319	266359	266361	266361	Vyvyan	975	" I feel it myself . And when Flora 's young admirers flutter and babble round her - just after Darrell has quitted his chair beside her - they seem very poor company . I am sure , Flora , "
266364	266400	266407	266408	the Colonel	13877	" that the mere acquaintance of such a man has done you much good ; and I am now in great hopes that , whenever you marry , it will be a man of sense . "
266401	266404	266407	266408	the Colonel	13877	" Um ! "
266419	266445	266485	266486	Mr. Vyvyan	1088	" How I wish , for my friend 's sake , that he was of an age which inspired Miss Vyvyan with less - veneration . "
266471	266483	266549	266550	The Colonel	13877	" It was given out that Darrell intended to marry again , "
266488	266548	266655	266655	she	975	" A man of that sort requires a very superior highly - educated woman ; and if Miss Carr Vipont had been a little more of his age she would have just suited him . But I am patriot enough to hope that he will remain single , and have no wife but his country , like Mr. Pitt . "
266661	266684	266655	266655	she	975	" You are Mr. Darrell 's most intimate friend ; I have heard him say so ; shall you see him soon ? "
266685	266693	266655	266655	she	975	" I fear not ; but why ? "
266694	266742	266751	266752	the Colonel	13877	" Why ? you , his friend ; do you not perceive that he is not happy ? I , a mere stranger , saw it at the first . You should cheer and comfort him ; you have that right - it is a noble privilege . "
266743	266749	266751	266752	the Colonel	13877	" My dear young lady , "
266756	266817	266823	266823	Flora	975	" you have a better heart than I thought for . It is true Darrell is not a happy man ; but can you give me any message that might cheer him more than an old bachelor 's commonplace exhortations to take heart , forget the rains of yesterday , and hope for some gleam of sun on the morrow ? "
266818	266821	266847	266847	her	975	" No , "
266827	266845	266847	266847	her	975	" it would be a presumption indeed in me , to affect the consoler 's part ; but "
266851	266868	266751	266752	the Colonel	13877	" but if I may judge by his letter , I may never see him again . "
266869	266888	266894	266894	Flora	975	" His letter ! He has written to you , then , as well as to your father ? "
266889	266892	266894	266894	Flora	975	" Yes , "
266900	266969	266981	266982	Mr. Vyvyan	1088	" a few lines in answer to a silly note of mine ; yes , tell him that I shall never forget his kind counsels , his delicate , indulgent construction of - of - in short , tell him my father is right , and that I shall be better and wiser all my life for the few short weeks in which I have known Guy Darrell . "
266970	266979	266998	266999	the Colonel	13877	" What secrets are you two whispering there ? "
266989	266996	267002	267002	he	13877	" Ask her ten years hence , "
267008	267024	267209	267210	Lady Selina	500	" The fairest leaves in the flower are the last that the bud will disclose . "
267202	267207	267209	267210	Lady Selina	500	" I had thought , "
267212	267435	267447	267448	the Colonel	13877	" that he might have felt a growing attachment for Honoria ; and considering the disparity of years , and that Honoria certainly might marry any one , he was too proud to incur the risk of refusal . But I will tell you in confidence , as a relation and dear friend , that Honoria has a very superior mind , and might have overlooked the mere age : congenial tastes - you understand . But on thinking it all over , I begin to doubt whether that be the true reason for his running away in this wild sort of manner . My maid tells me that his house - steward called to say that the establishment was to be broken up . That looks as if he had resigned London for good ; just , too , when , Carr says , the CRISIS , so long put off , is sure to burst on us . I 'm quite sick of clever men - one never knows how to trust them ; if they are not dishonest they are eccentric ! I have just been telling Honoria that clever men are , after all , the most tiresome husbands . Well , what makes you so silent ? What do you say ? Why do n't you speak ? "
267436	267445	267447	267448	the Colonel	13877	" I am slowly recovering from my shock , "
267450	267510	267516	267517	Lady Selina	500	" So Darrell shirks the CRISIS , and has not even hinted a preference for Honoria , the very girl in all London that would have made him a safe , rational companion . I told him so , and he never denied it . But it is a comfort to think he is no loss . Old monster ! "
267511	267514	267516	267517	Lady Selina	500	" Nay , "
267525	267642	267652	267653	the Colonel	13877	" I do n't say he is no loss . Honestly speaking - between ourselves - I think he is a very great loss . An alliance between him and Honoria would have united all the Vipont influence . Lord Montfort has the greatest confidence in Darrell ; and if this CRISIS comes , it is absolutely necessary for the Vipont interest that it should find somebody who can speak . Really , my dear Colonel Morley , you , who have such an influence over this very odd man , should exert it now . One must not be over - nice in times of CRISIS ; the country is at stake , Cousin Alban . "
267643	267650	267652	267653	the Colonel	13877	" I will do my best , "
267655	267709	267516	267517	Lady Selina	500	" I am quite aware that an alliance which would secure Darrell 's talents to the House of Vipont , and the House of Vipont to Darrell 's talents , would - but ' tis no use talking , we must not sacrifice Honoria even on the altar of her country 's interest ! "
267710	267733	267652	267653	the Colonel	13877	" Sacrifice ! Nonsense ! The man is not young certainly , but then what a grand creature , and so clever . "
267734	267751	267516	267517	Lady Selina	500	" Clever - yes ! But that was your very objection to him five minutes ago . "
267752	267778	267652	267653	the Colonel	13877	" I forgot the CRISIS . - One do n't want clever men every day , but there are days when one does want them ! "
267779	267819	267516	267517	Lady Selina	500	" I envy you that aphorism . But from what you now imply , I fear that Honoria may have allowed her thoughts to settle upon what may never take place ; and if so , she may fret . "
267820	267856	267857	267858	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Fret ! a daughter of mine fret ! - and of all my daughters , Honoria ! A girl of the best - disciplined mind ! Fret ! what a word ! - vulgar ! "
267861	267900	267901	267902	LADY SELINA	500	" So it is ; I blush for it ; but let us understand each other . If Darrell proposed for Honoria , you think , ambition apart , she would esteem him sufficiently for a decided preference . "
267905	267947	267948	267949	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" If that be his doubt , re - assure him . He is shy - men of genius are ; Honoria would esteem him ! Till he has actually proposed it would compromise her to say more even to you . "
267952	267976	267977	267978	LADY SELINA	500	" And if that be not the doubt , and if I ascertain that Darrell has no idea of proposing , Honoria would - "
267981	268006	268007	268008	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Despise him . Ah , I see by your countenance that you think I should prepare her . Is it so , frankly ? "
268011	268052	268063	268063	her	500	" Frankly , then . I think Guy Darrell , like many other men , has been so long in making up his mind to marry again that he has lost the right moment , and will never find it . "
268074	268082	268484	268485	the Colonel	13877	" POOR - DEAR - OLD MAN ! "
268474	268482	268484	268485	the Colonel	13877	" What have you there , George ? "
268494	268516	268484	268485	the Colonel	13877	" You seemed quite absorbed in its contents , and would not have noticed my presence but for Gyp 's bark . "
268517	268534	268484	268485	the Colonel	13877	" A volume of poems I never chanced to meet before , full of true genius . "
268535	268572	268484	268485	the Colonel	13877	" Bless me , poor Arthur Branthwaite 's poems . And you were positively reading those - not induced to do so by respect for his father ? Could you make head or tail of them ? "
268573	268619	268484	268485	the Colonel	13877	" There is a class of poetry which displeases middle age by the very attributes which render it charming to the young ; for each generation has a youth with idiosyncrasies peculiar to itself , and a peculiar poetry by which those idiosyncrasies are expressed . "
268667	268677	268684	268685	the Colonel	13877	" But I will not bore you at present . "
268678	268682	268684	268685	the Colonel	13877	" Thank you , "
268690	268722	268902	268903	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Perhaps you will lend me the book . I am going down to Lady Montfort 's by - and - by , and I can read it by the way . "
268723	268838	268684	268685	the Colonel	13877	" Yes , I will lend it to you till next season . Let me have it again then , to put on the table when Frank Vance comes to breakfast with me . The poet was his brother - in - law ; and though , for that reason , poets and poetry are a sore subject with Frank , yet the last time he breakfasted here , I felt , by the shake of his hand in parting , that he felt pleased by a mark of respect to all that is left of poor Arthur Branthwaite . So you are going to Lady Montfort ? Ask her why she chits me ! "
268839	268901	268902	268903	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" My dear uncle ! You know how secluded her life is at present ; but she has charged me to assure you of her unalterable regard for you ; and whenever her health and spirits are somewhat more recovered , I have no doubt that she will ask you to give her the occasion to make that assurance in person . "
268906	268932	268933	268933	GEORGE	855	" Can her health and spirits continue so long affected by grief for the loss of that distant acquaintance whom the law called her husband ? "
268936	269050	269059	269060	the Colonel	13877	" She is very far from well , and her spirits are certainly much broken . And now , uncle , for the little favour I came to ask . Since you presented me to Mr. Darrell , he kindly sent me two or three invitations to dinner , which my frequent absence from town would not allow me to accept . I ought to call on him ; and , as I feel ashamed not to have done so before , I wish you would accompany me to his house . One happy word from you would save me a relapse into stutter . When I want to apologise I always stutter . "
269051	269057	269059	269060	the Colonel	13877	" Darrell has left town , "
269064	269097	269115	269115	GEORGE	855	" you have missed an opportunity that will never occur again . The most charming companion ; an intellect so manly , yet so sweet ! I shall never find such another . "
269118	269125	269126	269127	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" When did he leave town ? "
269130	269135	269136	269136	GEORGE	855	" Three days ago . "
269139	269150	269151	269152	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Three days ago ! and for the Continent again ? "
269155	269277	269278	269278	GEORGE	855	" No ; for the Hermitage , George . I have such a letter from him ! You know how many years he has been absent from the world . When , this year , he re - appeared , he and I grew more intimate than we had ever been since we had left school ; for though the same capital held us before , he was then too occupied for much familiarity with an idle man like me . But just when I was intertwining what is left of my life with the bright threads of his , he snaps the web asunder : he quits this London world again ; says he will return to it no more . "
269281	269311	269312	269313	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Yet I did hear that he proposed to renew his parliamentary career ; nay , that he was about to form a second marriage , with Honoria Vipont ? "
269316	269585	269278	269278	GEORGE	855	" Mere gossip - not true . No , he will never marry again . Three days ago I thought it certain that he would - certain that I should find for my old age a nook in his home - the easiest chair in his social circle ; that my daily newspaper would have a fresh interest , in the praise of his name or the report of his speech ; that I should walk proudly into White 's , sure to hear there of Guy Darrell ; that I should keep from misanthropical rust my dry knowledge of life , planning shrewd panegyrics to him of a young happy wife , needing all his indulgence - panegyrics to her of the high - minded sensitive man , claiming tender respect and delicate soothing ; - that thus , day by day , I should have made more pleasant the home in which I should have planted myself , and found in his children boys to lecture and girls to spoil . Do n't be jealous , George . I like your wife , I love your little ones , and you will inherit all I have to leave . But to an old bachelor , who would keep young to the last , there is no place so sunny as the hearth of an old school - friend . But my house of cards is blown down - talk of it no more - ' tis a painful subject . You met Lionel Haughton here the last time you called - how did you like him ! "
269586	269591	269312	269313	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" Very much indeed . "
269592	269609	269610	269610	GEORGE	855	" Well , then , since you can not call on Darrell , call on him . "
269615	269630	269631	269632	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" It is just what I meant to do - what is his address ? "
269634	269750	269631	269632	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" There is his card - take it . He was here last night to inquire if I knew where Darrell had gone , though no one in his household , nor I either , suspected till this morning that Darrell had left town for good . You will find Lionel at home , for I sent him word I would call . But really I am not up to it now . Tell him from me that Mr. Darrell will not return to Carlton Gardens this season , and is gone to Fawley . At present Lionel need not know more - you understand ? And now , my dear George , good day . "
269782	269785	269631	269632	COLONEL MORLEY	628	" SETTLED QUESTIONS "
269787	269791	269912	269912	he	855	" FIXED OPINIONS . "
269904	269910	269912	269912	he	855	" I can well conceive , "
269914	270019	270020	270020	LIONEL	419	" your affection for Mr. Darrell . I remember , when I was a boy , how powerfully he impressed me , though I saw but little of him . He was then in the zenith of his career , and had but few moments to give to a boy like me ; but the ring of his voice and the flash of his eye sent me back to school , dreaming of fame and intent on prizes . I spent part of one Easter vacation at his house in town ; he bade his son , who was my schoolfellow , invite me . "
270023	270037	270038	270038	GEORGE	855	" You knew his son ? How Mr. Darrell has felt that loss ! "
270041	270088	270089	270089	LIONEL	419	" Heaven often veils its most provident mercy in what to man seems its sternest inflictions . That poor boy must have changed his whole nature , if his life had not , to a father like Mr. Darrell , occasioned grief sharper than his death . "
270092	270109	270110	270110	GEORGE	855	" You amaze me . Mr. Darrell spoke of him as a boy of great promise . "
270113	270165	270166	270166	LIONEL	419	" He had that kind of energy which to a father conveys the idea of promise , and which might deceive those older than himself - a fine bright - eyed , bold - tongued boy , with just enough awe of his father to bridle his worst qualities before him . "
270169	270174	270175	270175	GEORGE	855	" What were those ? "
270178	270451	270456	270456	George	855	" Headstrong arrogance - relentless cruelty . He had a pride which would have shamed his father out of pride , had Guy Darrell detected its nature - purse pride ! I remember his father said to me with a half - laugh : ' My boy must not be galled and mortified as I was every hour at school - clothes patched and pockets empty . ' And so , out of mistaken kindness , Mr. Darrell ran into the opposite extreme , and the son was proud , not of his father 's fame , but of his father 's money , and withal not generous , nor exactly extravagant , but using money as power - power that allowed him to insult an equal or to buy a slave . In a word , his nickname at school was ' Sir Giles Overreach . ' His death was the result of his strange passion for tormenting others . He had a fag who could not swim , and who had the greatest terror of the water ; and it was while driving this child into the river out of his depth that cramp seized himself , and he was drowned . Yes , when I think what that boy would have been as a man , succeeding to Darrell 's wealth - and had Darrell persevered as he would , perhaps , if the boy had lived in his public career - to the rank and titles he would probably have acquired and bequeathed - again , I say , in man 's affliction is often Heaven 's mercy . "
270459	270531	270532	270532	LIONEL	419	" Would that I could speak as plainly to Mr. Darrell himself ! For we find constantly in the world that there is no error that misleads us like the error that is half a truth wrenched from the other half ; and nowhere is such an error so common as when man applies it to the judgment of some event in his own life , and separates calamity from consolation . "
270535	270556	270557	270557	GEORGE	855	" True ; but who could have the heart to tell a mourning father that his dead son was worthless ? "
270560	270725	270804	270804	George	855	" Alas ! my young friend , the preacher must sometimes harden his own heart if he would strike home to another 's soul . But I am not sure that Mr. Darrell would need so cruel a kindness . I believe that his clear intellect must have divined some portions of his son 's nature which enabled him to bear the loss with fortitude . And he did bear it bravely . But now , Mr. Haughton , if you have the rest of the day free , I am about to make you an unceremonious proposition for its disposal . A lady who knew Mr. Darrell when she was very young has - a strong desire to form your acquaintance . She resides on the banks of the Thames , a little above Twickenham . I have promised to call on her this evening . Shall we dine together at Richmond ? and afterwards we can take a boat to her villa . "
270811	270832	270798	270798	Lionel	419	" Here are some remarkable poems by a brother - in - law of that remarkable artist , Frank Vance . "
270833	270897	270905	270905	George	855	" Frank Vance ! True , he had a brother - in - law a poet . I admire Frank so much ; and , though he professes to sneer at poetry , he is so associated in my mind with poetical images that I am prepossessed beforehand in favour of all that brings him , despite himself , in connection with poetry . "
270898	270903	270905	270905	George	855	" Tell me then , "
270915	270957	270958	270958	Lionel	419	" what you think of these lines . My good uncle would call them gibberish . I am not sure that I can construe them ; but when I was your age , I think I could - what say you ? "
270961	270984	270991	270991	George	855	" Exquisite indeed ! - nothing can be clearer - they express exactly a sentiment in myself that I could never explain . "
270985	270989	270991	270991	George	855	" Just so , "
270995	271106	271113	271113	Lionel	419	" Youth has a sentiment that it can not explain , and the sentiment is expressed in a form of poetry that middle age can not construe . It is true that poetry of the grand order interests equally all ages ; but the world ever throws out a poetry not of the grandest ; not meant to be durable - not meant to be universal , but following the shifts and changes of human sentiment , and just like those pretty sundials formed by flowers , which bloom to tell the hour , open their buds to tell it , and , telling it , fade themselves from time . "
271122	271130	271322	271323	the boy	1297	" How exquisite ! - how true ! "
271328	271340	271497	271497	George	855	" ' Fortune is so far , Fame so impossible ! ' "
271508	271556	271497	271497	George	855	" We near our destination , and you have not asked me even the name of the lady to whom you are to render homage . It is Lady Montfort , widow to the last Marquess . You have no doubt heard Mr. Darrell speak of her ? "
271557	271589	271605	271606	George Morley	855	" Never Mr. Darrell - Colonel Morley often . And in the world I have heard her cited as perhaps the handsomest , and certainly the haughtiest , woman in England . "
271590	271603	271605	271606	George Morley	855	" Never heard Mr. Darrell mention her ! that is strange indeed , "
271621	271639	271497	271497	George	855	" She was much in his house as a child , shared in his daughter 's education . "
271640	271726	271605	271606	George Morley	855	" Perhaps for that very reason he shuns her name . Never but once did I hear him allude to his daughter ; nor can I wonder at that , if it be true , as I have been told by people who seem to know very little of the particulars , that , while yet scarcely out of the nursery , she fled from his house with some low adventurer - a Mr. Hammond - died abroad the first year of that unhappy marriage . "
271727	271813	271497	271497	George	855	" Yes , that is the correct outline of the story ; and , as you guess , it explains why Mr. Darrell avoids mention of one , whom he associates with his daughter 's name ; though , if you desire a theme dear to Lady Montfort , you can select none that more interests her grateful heart than praise of the man who saved her mother from penury , and secured to herself the accomplishments and instruction which have been her chief solace . "
271814	271833	271605	271606	George Morley	855	" Chief solace ! Was she not happy with Lord Montfort ? What sort of man was he ? "
271834	271977	272214	272214	Milton	933	" I owe to Lord Montfort the living I hold , and I can remember the good qualities alone of a benefactor . If Lady Montfort was not happy with him , it is just to both to say that she never complained . But there is much in Lady Montfort 's character which the Marquess apparently failed to appreciate ; at all events , they had little in common , and what was called Lady Montfort 's haughtiness was perhaps but the dignity with which a woman of grand nature checks the pity that would debase her - the admiration that would sully - guards her own beauty , and protects her husband 's name . Here we are . Will you stay for a few minutes in the boat , while I go to prepare Lady Montfort for your visit ? "
272221	272223	272363	272364	the lark	8237	" Comus "
272371	272383	272780	272780	her	846	" Good morrow From his watch - tower in the skies . "
272706	272711	272780	272780	her	846	" Well , George . "
272712	272756	272777	272777	Caroline	846	" Mr. Darrell is not in London ; he went to Fawley three days ago ; at least he is there now . I have this from my uncle , to whom he wrote ; and whom his departure has vexed and saddened . "
272757	272775	272780	272780	her	846	" Three days ago ! It must have been he , then ! I was not deceived , "
272785	272832	272880	272881	George Morley	855	" There is no truth in the report you heard that he was to marry Honoria Vipont . My uncle thinks he will never marry again , and implies that he has resumed his solitary life at Fawley with a resolve to quit it no more . "
272866	272878	272880	272881	George Morley	855	" I have , therefore , fulfilled your commission so far , "
272883	273021	273067	273067	She	8251	" I have ascertained that Mr. Darrell is alive , and doubtless well ; so that it could not have been his ghost that startled you amidst yonder thicket . But I have done more : I have forestalled the wish you expressed to become acquainted with young Haughton ; and your object in postponing the accomplishment of that wish while Mr. Darrell himself was in town having ceased with Mr. Darrell 's departure , I have ventured to bring the young man with me . He is in the boat yonder . Will you receive him ? Or - but , my dear cousin , are you not too unwell today ? What is the matter ? Oh , I can easily make an excuse for you to Haughton . I will run and do so . "
273022	273066	273067	273067	She	8251	" No , George , no . I am as well as usual . I will see Mr. Haughton . All that you have heard of him , and have told me , interests me so much in his favour ; and besides - "
273084	273094	272880	272881	George Morley	855	" Have you no news of our missing friend ? "
273095	273121	273067	273067	She	8251	" None as yet ; but in a few days I shall renew my search . Now , then , I will go for Haughton . "
273122	273146	272880	272881	George Morley	855	" Do so ; and George , when you have presented him to me , will you kindly join that dear anxious child yonder !
273147	273196	273197	273197	George	855	" She is in the new arbour , or near it - her favourite spot . You must sustain her spirits , and give her hope . You can not guess how eagerly she looks forward to your visits , and how gratefully she relies on your exertions . "
273208	273221	274433	274434	Lady Montfort	770	" My exertions have established no claim to her gratitude as yet , "
274425	274431	274451	274451	her	770	" Our work - room , "
274454	274481	274433	274434	Lady Montfort	770	" mine and my dear pupil 's . Yes , that harp is hers . Is he still fond of music - I mean Mr. Darrell ? "
274482	274511	274521	274522	Lady Montfort	770	" Yes , though he does not care for it in crowds ; but he can listen for hours to Fairthorn 's flute . You remember Mr. Fairthorn ? "
274512	274519	274521	274522	Lady Montfort	770	" Ay , I remember him , "
274525	274535	274584	274584	he	419	" Mr. Darrell then likes his music , still ? "
274577	274583	274584	274584	he	419	" I know the spot ! "
274587	274596	274616	274616	Lionel	419	" Did you make the sketch of it ? "
274597	274615	274629	274629	they	8289	" I ? no ; it is hers - my pupil 's - my adopted child 's . "
274640	274652	274660	274661	Lady Montfort	770	" Your adopted child - what is she ? - who ? "
274664	274676	274769	274769	HORAT	835	" Wait here a moment ; I will go for her . "
274758	274767	274984	274985	Caroline Montfort	846	" Quem Fors dierum cunque dabit Lucro appone . "
274979	274982	274984	274985	Caroline Montfort	846	" Yes , "
274994	275030	275036	275036	Lionel	419	" yes , you will both forgive me for the surprise . Yes , you do see before you , grown up to become the pride of those who cherish her , that Sophy who - "
275031	275034	275036	275036	Lionel	419	" Sophy ! "
275039	275055	275056	275056	Sophy	442	" it is so , then ! I knew you were no stroller 's grandchild . "
275060	275080	275107	275107	his	419	" I am , I am his grandchild , and as proud to be so as I was then . "
275081	275105	275134	275134	Sophy	442	" Pardon me , pardon me ; I meant to say that he too was not what he seemed . You forgive me , "

But you and I , reader , have no other interest in these poems , except this - that they were written by the brother - in - law of that whimsical , miserly Frank Vance , who perhaps , but for such a brother - in - law , would never have gone through the labour by which he has cultivated the genius that achieved his fame ; and if he had not cultivated that genius , he might never have known Lionel ; and if he had never known Lionel , Lionel might never perhaps have gone to the Surrey village , in which he saw the Phenomenon : And , to push farther still that Voltaireian philosophy of ifs - if either Lionel or Frank Vance had not been so intimately associated in the minds of Sophy and Lionel with the golden holiday on the beautiful river , Sophy and Lionel might not have thought so much of those poems ; and if they had not thought so much of those poems , there might not have been between them that link of poetry without which the love of two young people is a sentiment , always very pretty it is true , but much too commonplace to deserve special commemoration in a work so uncommonly long as this is likely to be . And thus it is clear that Frank Vance is not a superfluous and episodical personage amongst the characters of this history , but , however indirectly , still essentially , one of those beings without whom the author must have given a very different answer to the question , "

His life and his projects are clear to my eyes - clear as if he dwelt in glass . Sophy is now of an age in which , were she placed in the care of some person whose respectability could not be impunged , she could not be legally forced away against her will ; but if under your roof , those whom Jasper has induced to institute a search , that he has no means to institute very actively himself , might make statements which as you are already aware might persuade others , though well - meaning , to assist him in separating her from you . He might publicly face even a police - court , if he thus hoped to shame the rich man into buying off an intolerable scandal . He might , in the first instance , and more probably , decoy her into his power through stealth ; and what might become of her before she was recovered ? Separate yourself from her for a time .

He should never forgive her if she were silly enough to fret for him . He should not be alone ; Sir Isaac would take care of him . He was not without plenty of money - savings of several months ; if he wanted more , he would apply to George Morley . He would write to her occasionally ; but she must not expect frequent letters ; he might be away for months - what did that signify ?

286526	286526	286539	286540	Lady Montfort	770	"
286527	286537	287507	287507	his	3036	" What is the matter ? you alarm me , "
286564	287500	287507	287507	his	3036	" Nay , my dear cousin , there is less cause for alarm than for anxious deliberation , and that upon more matters than those which directly relate to our poor fugitive . You know that I long shrunk from enlisting the police in aid of our search . I was too sensible of the pain and offence which such an application would occasion Waife - let us continue so to call him - and the discovery of it might even induce him to put himself beyond our reach , and quit England . But his prolonged silence , and my fears lest some illness or mishap might have befallen him , together with my serious apprehensions of the effect which unrelieved anxiety might produce on Sophy 's health , made me resolve to waive former scruples . Since I last saw you I have applied to one of the higher police - officers accustomed to confidential investigations of a similar nature . The next day he came to tell me that he had learned that a friend of his , who had been formerly a distinguished agent in the detective police , had been engaged for months in tracking a person whom he conjectured to be the same as the one whom I had commissioned him to discover , and with somewhat less caution and delicacy than I had enjoined . The fugitive 's real name had been given to this ex - agent - the cause for search , that he had abducted and was concealing his granddaughter from her father . It was easy for me to perceive why this novel search had hitherto failed , no suspicion being entertained that Waife had separated himself from Sophy , and the inquiry being therefore rather directed towards the grandchild than the grandfather . But that inquiry had altogether ceased of late , and for this terrible reason - a different section of the police had fixed its eye upon the father on whose behalf the search had been instituted . This Jasper Losely ah ! our poor friend might well shudder to think Sophy should fall into his hands ! haunts the resorts of the most lawless and formidable desperadoes of London . He appears to be a kind of authority amongst them ; but there is no evidence that as yet he has committed himself to any participation in their habitual courses . He lives profusely , for a person in such society regaling Daredevils whom he awes by a strength and courage which are described as extraordinary , but with out any visible means . It seems that the ex - agent , who had been thus previously employed in Jasper Losely 's name , had been engaged , not by Jasper himself , but by a person in very respectable circumstances , whose name I have ascertained to be Poole . And the ex - agent deemed it right to acquaint this Mr. Poole with Jasper 's evil character and ambiguous mode of life , and to intimate to his employer that it might not be prudent to hold any connection with such a man , and still less proper to assist in restoring a young girl to his care . On this Mr. Poole became so much agitated , and expressed himself so incoherently as to his relations with Jasper , that the ex - agent conceived suspicions against Poole himself , and reported the whole circumstances to one of the chiefs of the former service , through whom they reached the very man whom I myself was employing . But this ex - agent , who had , after his last interview with Poole , declined all further interference , had since then , through a correspondent in a country town , whom he had employed at the first , obtained a clue to my dear old friend 's wanderings , more recent , and I think more hopeful , than any I had yet discovered . You will remember that when questioning Sophy as to any friends in her former life to whom it was probable Waife might have addressed himself , she could think of no one so probable as a cobbler named Merle , with whom he and she had once lodged , and of whom he had often spoken to her with much gratitude as having put him in the way of recovering herself , and having shown him a peculiar trustful kindness on that occasion . But you will remember also that I could not find this Merle ; he had left the village , near this very place , in which he had spent the greater part of his life - his humble trade having been neglected in consequence of some strange superstitious occupations in which , as he had grown older , he had become more and more absorbed . He had fallen into poverty , his effects had been sold off ; he had gone away no one knew whither . Well , the ex - agent , who had also been directed to this Merle by his employer , had , through his correspondent , ascertained that the cobbler was living at Norwich , where he passed under the name of the Wise Man , and where he was in perpetual danger of being sent to the house of correction as an impostor , dealing in astrology , crystal - seeing , and such silly or nefarious practices . Very odd , indeed , and very melancholy , too , "
287512	287538	287556	287556	her	770	" that a man so gifted as our poor friend should ever have cultivated an acquaintance with a cobbler who deals in the Black Art ! "
287539	287550	287556	287556	her	770	" Sophy has talked to me much about that cobbler , "
287562	287606	287607	287607	GEORGE	855	" It was under his roof that she first saw Lionel Haughton . But though the poor man may be an ignorant enthusiast , he is certainly , by her account , too kind and simple - hearted to be a designing impostor . "
287610	288297	288313	288313	her	846	" Possibly . But to go on with my story : A few weeks ago , an elderly lame man , accompanied by a dog , who was evidently poor dear Sir Isaac , lodged two days with Merle at Norwich . On hearing this , I myself went yesterday to Norwich , saw and talked to Merle , and through this man I hope , more easily , delicately , and expeditiously than by any other means , to achieve our object . He evidently can assist us , and , as evidently , Waife has not told him that he is flying from Sophy and friends , but from enemies and persecutors . For Merle , who is impervious to bribes , and who at first was churlish and rude , became softened as my honest affection for the fugitive grew clear to him , and still more when I told him how wretched Sophy was at her grandfather 's disappearance , and that she might fret herself into a decline . And we parted with this promise on his side , that if I would bring down to him either Sophy herself which is out of the question or a line from her , which , in referring to any circumstances while under his roof that could only be known to her and himself , should convince him that the letter was from her hand , assuring him that it was for Waife 's benefit and at her prayer that he should bestir himself in search for her grandfather , and that he might implicitly trust to me , he would do all he could to help us . So far , then , so good . But I have now more to say , and that is in reference to Sophy herself . While we are tracking her grandfather , the peril to her is not lessened . Never was that peril thoroughly brought before my eyes until I had heard actually from the police agent the dreadful character and associations of the man who can claim her in a fathers name . Waife , it is true , had told you that his son was profligate , spendthrift , lawless - sought her , not from natural affection , but as an instrument to be used , roughly and coarsely , for the purpose of extorting money from Mr. Darrell . But this stops far short of the terrible reality . Imagine the effect on her nerves , so depressed as they now are , nay , on her very life , should this audacious miscreant force himself here and say , ' Come with me , you are my child . ' And are we quite sure that out of some refining nobleness of conscience she might not imagine it her duty to obey , and to follow him ? The more abject and friendless his condition , the more she might deem it her duty to be by his side . I have studied her from her childhood . She is capable of any error in judgment , if it be made to appear a martyr 's devoted self - sacrifice . You may well shudder , my dear cousin . But grant that she were swayed by us and by the argument that so to act would betray and kill her beloved grandfather , still , in resisting this ruffian 's paternal authority , what violent and painful scenes might ensue ! What dreadful publicity to be attached for ever to her name ! Nor is this all . Grant that her father does not discover her , but that he is led by his associates into some criminal offence , and suffers by the law - her relationship , both to him from whom you would guard her , and to him whose hearth you have so tenderly reared her to grace , suddenly dragged to day - would not the shame kill her ? And in that disclosure how keen would be the anguish of Darrell ! "
288298	288303	288313	288313	her	846	" Oh , heavens ! "
288316	288442	287607	287607	GEORGE	855	" you freeze me with terror . But this man can not be so fallen as you describe . I have seen him - spoken with him in his youth - hoped then to assist in a task of conciliation , pardon . Nothing about him then foreboded so fearful a corruption . He might be vain , extravagant , selfish , false - Ah , yes ! he was false indeed ! but still the ruffian you paint , banded with common criminals , can not be the same as the gay , dainty , perfumed , fair - faced adventurer with whom my ill - fated playmate fled her father 's house . You shake your head - what is it you advise ? "
288443	288546	288313	288313	her	846	" To expedite your own project - to make at once the resolute attempt to secure to this poor child her best , her most rightful protector - to let whatever can be done to guard her from danger or reclaim her father from courses to which despair may be driving him - to let , I say , all this be done by the person whose interest in doing it effectively is so paramount - whose ability to judge of and decide on the wisest means is so immeasurably superior to all that lies within our own limited experience of life . "
288547	288612	287607	287607	GEORGE	855	" But you forget that our friend told me that he had appealed to - to Mr. Darrell on his return to England : that Mr. Darrell had peremptorily refused to credit the claim ; and had sternly said that , even if Sophy 's birth could be proved , he would not place under his father 's roof the grandchild of William Losely . "
288613	288633	288313	288313	her	846	" True ; and yet you hoped reasonably enough to succeed where he , poor outcast , had failed . "
288634	288795	287607	287607	GEORGE	855	" Yes , yes ; I did hope that Sophy - her manners formed , her education completed - all her natural exquisite graces so cultured and refined , as to justify pride in the proudest kindred - I did so hope that she should be brought , as it were by accident , under his notice ; that she would interest and charm him ; and that the claim , when made , might thus be welcomed with delight . Mr. Darrell 's abrupt return to a seclusion so rigid forbids the opportunity that ought easily have been found or made if he had remained in London . But suddenly , violently to renew a claim that such a man has rejected , before he has ever seen that dear child - before his heart and his taste plead for her - who would dare to do it ? or , if so daring , who could hope success ? "
288796	288821	288313	288313	her	846	" My dear Lady Montfort , my noble cousin , with repute as spotless as the ermine of your robe - who but you ? "
288822	288845	288870	288870	he	855	" Who but I ? Any one . Mr. Darrell would not even read through a letter addressed to him by me . "
288865	288868	288870	288870	he	855	" Incredible ! "
288874	289099	288313	288313	her	846	" I have always suspected , and so indeed has my uncle , that Darrell had some cause of complaint against your mother . Perhaps he might have supposed that she had not sufficiently watched over his daughter , or had not sufficiently inquired into the character of the governess whom she recommended to him ; and that this had led to an estrangement between Darrell and your mother , which could not fail to extend somewhat to yourself . But such misunderstandings can surely now be easily removed . Talk of his not reading a letter addressed to him by you ! Why , do I not remember , when I was on a visit to my schoolfellow , his son , what influence you , a mere child yourself , had over that grave , busy man , then in the height of his career - how you alone could run without awe into his study - how you alone had the privilege to arrange his books , sort his papers - so that we two boys looked on you with a solemn respect , as the depositary of all his state secrets - how vainly you tried to decoy that poor timid Matilda , his daughter , into a share of your own audacity ! - Is not all this true ? "
289100	289112	288870	288870	he	855	" Oh yes , yes - old days gone for ever ! "
289113	289293	289294	289295	LADY MONTFORT	770	" Do I not remember how you promised that , before I went back to school , I should hear Darrell read aloud - how you brought the volume of Milton to him in the evening - how he said , ' No , to - morrow night ; I must now go to the House of Commons ' - how I marvelled to hear you answer boldly , ' To - morrow night George will have left us , and I have promised that he shall hear you read ' - and how , looking at you under those dark brows with serious softness , he said : ' Right : promises once given , must be kept . But was it not rash to promise in another 's name ? ' - and you answered , half gently , half pettishly , ' As if you could fail me ! ' He took the book without another word , and read . What reading it was too ! And do you not remember another time , how - "
289302	289352	289762	289763	Lady Montfort	770	" Ay , ay - I need no reminding of all - all ! Kindest , noblest , gentlest friend to a giddy , heedless child , unable to appreciate the blessing . But now , George , I dare not , I can not write to Mr. Darrell . "
289503	289761	289762	289763	Lady Montfort	770	" Who should be the pleader for one whose claim , if acknowledged , would affect his own fortunes , but Lionel Haughton ? - Hold ! - look where yonder they come into sight - there by the gap in the evergreens . May we not hope that Providence , bringing those two beautiful lives together , gives a solution to the difficulties which thwart our action and embarrass our judgment ? I conceived and planned a blissful romance the first moment I gathered fran Sophy 's artless confidences the effect that had been produced on her whole train of thought and feeling by the first meeting with Lionel in her childhood ; by his brotherly , chivalrous kindness , and , above all , by the chance words he let fall , which discontented her with a life of shift and disguise , and revealed to her the instincts of her own holiest truthful nature . An alliance between Lionel Haughton and Sophy seemed to me the happiest possible event that could befall Guy Darrell . The two branches of his family united - a painful household secret confined to the circle of his own kindred - granting Sophy 's claim never perfectly cleared up , but subject to a tormenting doubt - her future equally assured - her possible rights equally established - Darrell 's conscience and pride reconciled to each other . And how , even but as wife to his young kinsman , he would learn to love one so exquisitely endearing ! "
289772	289791	289797	289797	George	855	" When I heard that Mr. Darrell was about to marry again , my project was necessarily arrested . "
289792	289795	289797	289797	George	855	" Certainly , "
289799	289853	289854	289855	LADY MONTFORT	770	" if he formed new ties , Sophy would be less an object in his existence , whether or not he recognised her birth . The alliance between her and Lionel would lose many of its advantages ; and any address to him on Sophy 's behalf would become yet more ungraciously received . "
289858	289974	289975	289975	GEORGE	855	" In that case I had resolved to adopt Sophy as my own child ; lay by from my abundant income an ample dowry for her ; and whether Mr. Darrell ever know it or not , at least I should have the secret joy to think that I was saving him from the risk of remorse hereafter - should she be , as we believe , his daughter 's child , and have been thrown upon the world destitute ; - yes , the secret joy of feeling that I was sheltering , fostering as a mother , one whose rightful home might be with him who in my childhood sheltered , fostered me ! "
289980	290179	290347	290347	GEORGE	855	" How , in proportion as we know you , the beauty which you veil from the world outshines that which you can not prevent the world from seeing ! But you must not let this grateful enthusiasm blind your better judgment . You think these young persons are beginning to be really attached to each other . Then it is the more necessary that no time should be lost in learning how Mr. Darrell would regard such a marriage . I do not feel so assured of his consent as you appear to do . At all events , this should be ascertained before their happiness is seriously involved . I agree with you that Lionel is the best intermediator to plead for Sophy ; and his very generosity in urging her prior claim to a fortune that might otherwise pass to him is likely to have weight with a man so generous himself as Guy Darrell is held to be . But does Lionel yet know all ? Have you yet ventured to confide to him , or even to Sophy herself , the nature of her claim on the man who so proudly denies it ? "
290180	290346	290347	290347	GEORGE	855	" No - I deemed it due to Sophy 's pride of sex to imply to her that she would , in fortune and in social position , be entitled to equality with those whom she might meet here . And that is true , if only as the child whom I adopt and enrich . I have not said more . And only since Lionel has appeared has she ever seemed interested in anything that relates to her parentage . From the recollection of her father she naturally shrinks - she never mentions his name . But two days ago she did ask timidly , and with great change of countenance , if it was through her mother that she was entitled to a rank higher than she had hitherto known ; and when I answered ' yes , ' she sighed , and said ' But my dear grandfather never spoke to me of her ; he never even saw my mother . ' "
290350	290408	290409	290410	LADY MONTFORT	770	" And you , I suspect , do not much like to talk of that mother . I have gathered from you , unawares to yourself , that she was not a person you could highly praise ; and to me , as a boy , she seemed , with all her timidity , wayward and deceitful . "
290413	290493	290494	290494	GEORGE	855	" Alas ! how bitterly she must have suffered - and how young she was ! But you are right ; I can not speak to Sophy of her mother , the subject is connected with so much sorrow . But I told her ' that she should know all soon , ' and she said , with a sweet and melancholy patience , ' When my poor grandfather will be by to hear ; I can wait . ' "
290497	290551	290552	290553	LADY MONTFORT	770	" But is Lionel , with his quick intellect and busy imagination , equally patient ? Does he not guess at the truth ? You have told him that you do meditate a project which affects Guy Darrell , and required his promise not to divulge to Darrell his visits in this house . "
290555	290579	290580	290580	GEORGE	855	" He knows that Sophy 's paternal grandfather was William Losely . From your uncle he heard William Losely 's story , and - "
290583	290588	290589	290590	LADY MOSTFORT	1122	" My uncle Alban ? "
290593	290846	290580	290580	GEORGE	855	" Yes ; the Colonel was well acquainted with the elder Losely in former days , and spoke of him to Lionel with great affection . It seems that Lionel 's father knew him also , and thoughtlessly involved him in his own pecuniary difficulties . Lionel was not long a visitor here before he asked me abruptly if Mr. Waife 's real name was not Losely . I was obliged to own it , begging him not at present to question me further . He said then , with much emotion , that he had an hereditary debt to discharge to William Losely , and that he was the last person who ought to relinquish belief in the old man 's innocence of the crime for which the law had condemned him , or to judge him harshly if the innocence were not substantiated . You remember with what eagerness he joined in your search , until you positively forbade his interposition , fearing that should our poor friend hear of inquiries instituted by one whom he could not recognise as a friend , and might possibly consider an emissary of his son 's , he would take yet greater pains to conceal himself . But from the moment that Lionel learned that Sophy 's grandfather was William Losely , his manner to Sophy became yet more tenderly respectful . He has a glorious nature , that young man ! But did your uncle never speak to you of William Losely ? "
290847	290935	290589	290590	LADY MOSTFORT	1122	" No . I am not surprised at that . My uncle Alban avoids ' painful subjects . ' I am only surprised that he should have revived a painful subject in talk to Lionel . But I now understand why , when Waife first heard my name , he seemed affected , and why he so specially enjoined me never to mention or describe him to my friends and relations . Then Lionel knows Losely 's story , but not his son 's connection with Darrell ? "
290936	291025	290580	290580	GEORGE	855	" Certainly not . He knows but what is generally said in the world , that Darrell 's daughter eloped with a Mr. Hammond , a man of inferior birth , and died abroad , leaving but one child , who is also dead . Still Lionel does suspect , - my very injunctions of secrecy must make him more than suspect , that the Loselys are somehow or other mixed up With Darrell 's family history . Hush ! I hear his voice yonder - they approach . "
291026	291134	291334	291334	he	419	" My dear cousin , let it be settled between us , then , that you frankly and without delay communicate to Lionel the whole truth , so far as it is known to us , and put it to him how best and most touchingly to move Mr. Darrell towards her , of whom we hold him to be the natural protector . I will write to my uncle to return to England that he may assist us in the same good work . Meanwhile , I shall have only good tidings to communicate to Sophy in my new hopes to discover her grandfather through Merle . "
291329	291332	291334	291334	he	419	" Nothing , "
291336	291455	291301	291301	He	419	" but a respect for her more than filial anxiety at this moment could have kept my heart thus long silent . But that heart is so deeply pledged - so utterly hers - that it has grown an ingratitude , a disrespect - to my generous kinsman , to conceal from him any longer the feelings which must colour my whole future existence . Nor can I say to her , ' Can you return my affection ? - will you listen to my vows ? - will you accept them at the altar ? ' - until I have won , as I am sure to win , the approving consent of my more than father . "
291456	291476	291334	291334	he	419	" You feel sure to win that consent , in spite of the stain on her grandfather 's name ? "
291477	291664	291672	291673	Lady Montfort	770	" When Darrell learns that , but for my poor father 's fault , that name might be spotless now ! - yes ! I am not Mr. Darrell 's son - the transmitter of his line . I believe yet that he will form new ties . By my mother 's side I have no ancestors to boast of ; and you have owned to me that Sophy 's mother was of gentle birth . Alban Morley told me , when I last saw him , that Darrell wishes me to marry , and leaves me free to choose my bride . Yes ; I have no doubt of Mr. Darrell 's consent . My dear mother will welcome to her heart the prize so coveted by mine ; and Charles Haughton 's son will have a place at his hearth for the old age of William Losely . Withdraw your interdict at once , dearest Lady Montfort , and confide to me all that you have hitherto left unexplained , but have promised to reveal when the time came . The time has come . "
291665	291670	291672	291673	Lady Montfort	770	" It has come , "
291677	291757	292443	292444	the recluse	11903	" and Heaven grant that it may bear the blessed results which were in my thoughts when I took Sophy as my own adopted daughter , and hailed in yourself the reconciler of conflicting circumstance . Not under this roof should you woo William Losely 's grandchild . Doubly are you bound to ask Guy Darrell 's consent and blessing . At his hearth woo your Sophy - at his hands ask a bride in his daughter 's child . "
292432	292441	292443	292444	the recluse	11903	" In truth , my dear young kinsman , "
292446	292708	292840	292840	Darrell	512	" in truth I am , with slowness , and with frequent relapses , labouring through convalescence from a moral fever . My nerves are yet unstrung . I am as one to whom is prescribed the most complete repose ; - the visits , even of friends the dearest , forbidden as a perilous excitement . The sight of you - of any one from the great world - but especially of one whose rich vitality of youth and hope affronts and mocks my own fatigued exhaustion , would but irritate , unsettle , torture me . When I am quite well I will ask you to come . I shall enjoy your visit . Till then , on no account , and on no pretext , let my morbid ear catch the sound of your footfall on my quiet floor . Write to me often , but tell me nothing of the news and gossip of the world . Tell me only of yourself , your studies , your thoughts , your sentiments , your wishes . Nor forget my injunctions . Marry young , marry for love ; let no ambition of power , no greed of gold , ever mislead you into giving to your life a companion who is not the half of your soul . Choose with the heart of a man ; I know that you will choose with the self - esteem of a gentleman ; and be assured beforehand of the sympathy and sanction of your ' CHURLISH BUT LOVING KINSMAN . ' "
292830	292838	292843	292843	his	512	" If it be as you state , "
292847	292885	293372	293372	Lionel	419	" a matter that relates to myself , I claim , as a lawyer for my own affairs - the precaution I once enjoined to my clients - a written brief should always precede a personal consultation . "
293367	293370	293372	293372	Lionel	419	" And , "
293374	293453	293497	293497	he	419	" Lady Montfort seems to fear that she has given you some cause of displeasure - what I know not , but which might have induced you to disapprove of the acquaintance I had begun with her . Be that as it may , would you could hear the reverence with which she ever alludes to your worth - the gratitude with which she attests her mother 's and her own early obligations to your intellect and heart ! "
293493	293496	293497	293497	he	419	" Grant , "
293500	293792	294646	294648	such a benefactor	8790	" that her father 's tale be false - and no doubt you have sufficient reasons to discredit it - still , if you can not love her as your daughter 's child , receive , know her , I implore - let her love and revere you - as my wife ! Leave me to protect her from a lawless father - leave me to redeem , by some deeds of loyalty and honour , any stain that her grandsire 's sentence may seem to fix upon our union . Oh ! if ambitious before , how ambitious I should be now - to efface for her sake , as for mine , her grandsire 's shame , my father 's errors ! But if , on the other hand , she should , on the requisite inquiries , be proved to descend from your ancestry - your father 's blood in her pure veins - I know , alas ! then that I should have no right to aspire to such nuptials . Who would even think of her descent from a William Losely ? Who would not be too proud to remember only her descent from you ? All spots would vanish in the splendour of your renown ; the highest in the land would court her alliance . And I am but the pensioner of your bounty , and only on my father 's side of gentle origin . But still I think you would not reject me - you would place the future to my credit ; and I would wait , wait patiently , till I had won such a soldier 's name as would entitle me to mate with a daughter of the Darrells . "
294089	294093	294646	294648	such a benefactor	8790	" Unhappy boy ! "
294099	294365	294610	294610	Lionel	419	" is it through you that the false and detested woman who has withered up the noon - day of my life seeks to dishonour its blighted close ? Talk not to me of Lady Montfort 's gratitude and reverence ! Talk not to me of her amiable , tender , holy aim , to obtrude upon my childless house the grand - daughter of a convicted felon ! Show her these lines , and ask her by what knowledge of my nature she can assume that ignominy to my name would be a blessing to my hearth ? Ask her , indeed , how she can dare to force herself still upon my thoughts - dare to imagine she can lay me under obligations - dare to think she can be something still in my forlorn existence ! Lionel Haughton , I command you in the name of all the dead whom we can claim as ancestors in common , to tear from your heart , as you would tear a thought of disgrace , this image which has bewitched your reason . My daughter , thank Heaven , left no pledge of an execrable union . But a girl who has been brought up by a thief - a girl whom a wretch so lost to honour as Jasper Losely sought to make an instrument of fraud to my harassment and disgrace , be her virtues and beauty what they may , I could not , without intolerable anguish , contemplate as the wife of Lionel Haughton . But receive her as your wife !
294366	294609	295196	295196	he	419	" Admit her within these walls ! Never , never ; I scorn to threaten you with loss of favour , loss of fortune . Marry her if you will . You shall have an ample income secure to you . But from that moment our lives are separated - our relation ceases . You will never again see nor address me . But oh , Lionel , can you - can you inflict upon me this crowning sorrow ? Can you , for the sake of a girl of whom you have seen but little , or in the Quixotism of atonement for your father 's fault , complete the ingratitude I have experienced from those who owed me most ? I can not think it . I rejoice that you wrote - did not urge this suit in person . I should not have been able to control my passion ; we might have parted foes . As it is , I restrain myself with difficulty ! That woman , that child , associated thus to tear from me the last affection left to my ruined heart . No ! You will not be so cruel ! Send this , I command you , to Lady Montfort . See again neither her nor the impostor she has been cherishing for my disgrace . This letter will be your excuse to break off with both - with both . GUY DARRELL . "
295234	295239	295589	295589	He	419	" sa pauvre vie . "
295583	295588	296453	296453	her	8838	" a settled income . "
296456	296499	296453	296453	her	8838	" You are sure that , so long as Losely draws this weekly stipend from the man whom he has in his power , he will persist in the same course of life . Can you not warn him of the danger ? "
296500	296513	296453	296453	her	8838	" Peach against pals ! I dare not . No trusting him . "
296514	296578	296453	296453	her	8838	" He would come down , mad with brandy , make an infernal row , seize two or three by the throat , dash their heads against each other , blab , bully , and a knife would be out , and a weasand or two cut , and a carcase or so dropped into the Thames - mine certainly - his perhaps . "
296579	296596	296453	296453	her	8838	" You say you can keep back this plot against him for two or three days ? "
296597	296655	296453	296453	her	8838	" For two days - yes . I should be glad to save General Jas . He has the bones of a fine fellow , and if he had not destroyed himself by brandy , he might have been at the top of the tree - in the profession . But he is fit for nothing now . "
296656	296668	296453	296453	her	8838	" Ah ! and you say the brandy is killing him ? "
296669	296692	296453	296453	her	8838	" No , he will not be killed by brandy , if he continues to drink it among the same jolly set . "
296693	296750	296453	296453	her	8838	" And if he were left without the money to spend amongst these terrible companions , he would no longer resort to their meetings ? You are right there . The same vanity that makes him pleased to be the great man in that society would make him shrink from coming amongst them as a beggar . "
296751	296984	296453	296453	her	8838	" And if he had not the wherewithal to pay the weekly subscription , there would be an excuse to shut the door in his face . All these fellows wish to do is to get rid of him ; and if by fair means , there would be no necessity to resort to foul . The only danger would be that from which you have so often saved him . In despair , would he not commit some violent rash action - a street robbery , or something of the kind ? He has courage for any violence , but no longer the cool head to plan a scheme which would not be detected . You see I can prevent my pals joining in such risks as he may propose , or letting him if he were to ask it into an adventure of their own , for they know that I am a safe adviser ; they respect me ; the law has never been able to lay hold of me ; and when I say to them , ' That fellow drinks , blabs , and boasts , and would bring us all into trouble , ' they will have nothing to do with him ; but I can not prevent his doing what he pleases out of his own muddled head , and with his own reckless hand . "
296985	297003	296453	296453	her	8838	" But you will keep in his confidence , and let me know till that he proposes ! "
297004	297007	297082	297082	She	8844	" Yes . "
297008	297081	297161	297161	her	8844	" And meanwhile , he must come to me . And this time I have more hope than ever , since his health gives way , and he is weary of crime itself . Mr. Cutts , come near - softly . Look - nay , nay , he can not see you from below , and you are screened by the blind . Look , I say , where he sits . "
297138	297147	297161	297161	her	8844	" It is thus that his mornings pass , "
297164	297180	297188	297188	Cutts	954	" Look , I say , is he formidable now ? can you fear him ? "
297181	297186	297188	297188	Cutts	954	" Very much indeed , "
297190	297218	297161	297161	her	8844	" He is only stupefied , and he can shake off a doze as quickly as a bulldog does when a rat is let into his kennel . "
297219	297294	297188	297188	Cutts	954	" Mr. Cutts , you tell me that he constantly carries about him the same old pocket - book which he says contains his fortune ; in other words , the papers that frighten his victim into giving him the money which is now the cause of his danger . There is surely no pocket you can not pick or get picked , Mr. Cutts ? Fifty pounds for that book in three hours . "
297295	297318	297161	297161	her	8844	" Fifty pounds are not enough ; the man he sponges on would give more to have those papers in his power . "
297319	297539	297550	297550	Cutts	954	" Possibly ; but Losely has not been dolt enough to trust you sufficiently to enable you to know how to commence negotiations . Even if the man 's name and address be amongst those papers , you could not make use of the knowledge without bringing Jasper himself upon you ; and even if Jasper were out of the way , you would not have the same hold over his victim ; you know not the circumstances ; you could make no story out of some incoherent rambling letters ; and the man , who , I can tell you , is by nature a bully , and strong , compared with any other man but Jasper , would seize you by the collar ; and you would be lucky if you got out of his house with no other loss than the letters , and no other gain but a broken bone . Pooh ! YOU know all that , or you would have stolen the book , and made use of it before . Fifty pounds for that book in three hours ; and if Jasper Losely be safe and alive six months hence , fifty pounds more , Mr. Cutts . See ! he stirs not must be fast asleep . Now is the moment . "
297540	297548	297550	297550	Cutts	954	" What , in his own room ! "
297554	297603	297667	297667	Poole	790	" Why , he would know who did it ; and where should I be to - morrow ? No - in the streets ; any one has a right to pick a pocket in the Queen 's highways . In three hours you shall have the book . "

298253	298328	298195	298195	I	0	" Yes , Sammy , dear , I 'll hold my tongue . But Sammy sha n't be imposed upon by mendicants ; for I know he is a mendicant - one of those sharpers or blacklegs who took oo in , poor innocent Sam , in oo wild bachelor days , and oo good heart ca n't bear to see him in distress ; but there must be an end to all things . "

298347	298353	298355	298356	the angel	8873	" My poor dear hubby , "
298364	298383	298390	298390	Poole	1003	" oo will be in good hands to advise oo ; for I 've been and told Pa ! "
298384	298388	298405	298405	his	8874	" You have , "
298392	298400	298640	298640	his	8874	" told your father - you have ! "
298656	298665	298726	298726	she	1003	" Go up - stairs and stir not , "
298741	298793	298799	298799	Poole	1003	" Mr. Poole , I have but a few words to say . The letters which gave Jasper Losely the power to extort money from you are no longer in his possession ; they are in mine . You need fear him no more - you will fee him no more . "
298794	298797	298799	298799	Poole	1003	" Oh ! "
298806	298831	298726	298726	she	1003	" the blessing of a father of a family - a babe not six weeks born - be on your blessed , blessed head ! "
298832	298898	298912	298912	Poole	1003	" Get up , and do n't talk nonsense . I do not give you these papers at present , nor burn them . Instead of being in the power of a muddled , irresolute drunkard , you are in the power of a vigilant , clear - brained woman . You are in my power , and you will act as I tell you . "
298899	298910	298912	298912	Poole	1003	" You can ask nothing wrong , I am sure , "
298920	298942	298726	298726	she	1003	" Command me ; but the papers can be of no use to you ; I will pay for them handsomely . "
298943	299264	299487	299489	MRS . CRANE	482	" Be silent and listen . I retain these papers - first , because Jasper Losely must not know that they ever passed to my hands ; secondly , because you must inflict no injury on Losely himself . Betray me to him , or try to render himself up to the law , and the documents will be used against you ruthlessly . Obey , and you have nothing to fear , and nothing to pay . When Jasper Losely calls on you tomorrow , ask him to show you the letters . He can not ; he will make excuses . Decline peremptorily , but not insultingly his temper is fierce , to pay him farther . He will perhaps charge you with having hired some one to purloin his pocket - book ; let him think it . Stop - your window here opens on the ground - a garden without : - Ah ! have three of the police in that garden , in sight of the window . Point to them if he threaten you ; summon them to your aid , or pass out to them , if he actually attempt violence . But when he has left the house , you must urge no charge against him ; he must be let off unscathed . You can be at no loss for excuse in this mercy ; a friend of former times - needy , unfortunate , whom habits of drink maddened for the moment - necessary to eject him - inhuman to prosecute - any story you please . The next day you can , if you choose , leave London for a short time ; I advise it . But his teeth will be drawn ; he will most probably never trouble you again . I know his character . There , I have done ; open the door , sir . "
299492	299514	299515	299515	LOSELY	721	" SO ! You see we can not help meeting , Jasper dear , do what you will to shun me . "
299518	299546	299547	299549	MRS . CRANE	482	" I - I - you always startle me so ! - you are in town , then ? - to stay ? - your old quarters ? "
299552	299595	299596	299596	LOSELY	721	" Why ask ? You can not wish to know where I am - you would not call . But how fares it ? - what do you do ? - how do you live ? You look ill - Poor Jasper . "
299600	299611	299639	299639	she	482	" Hang your pity , and give me some money . "
299649	299713	299773	299773	he	8906	" I said you would always find me when at the worst of your troubles . And so , Jasper , it shall be till this right hand of yours is powerless as the clay at our feet . Walk - walk ; you are not afraid of me ? - walk on , tell me all . Where have you just been ? "
299766	299771	299773	299773	he	8906	" And the coward , "
299779	299815	299776	299776	his	8906	" got out of his window - and three policemen in his garden . He must have bribed a pickpocket - low knave that he is . But I shall find out - and then - "
299816	299877	299773	299773	he	8906	" And then , Jasper , how will you be better off ? - the letters are gone ; and Poole has you in his power if you threaten him again . Now , hark you ; you did not murder the Italian who was found stabbed in the fields yonder a week ago ; L100 reward for the murderer ? "
299878	299913	299776	299776	his	8906	" I - no . How coldly you ask ! I have hit hard in fair fight ; murdered - never . If ever I take to that , I shall begin with Poole . "
299914	299959	299773	299773	he	8906	" But I tell you , Jasper , that you are suspected of that murder ; that you will be accused of that murder ; and if I had not thus fortunately met you , for that murder you would be tried and hanged . "
299960	299970	299776	299776	his	8906	" Are you serious ? Who could accuse me ? "
299971	300011	300033	300033	her	8909	" Those who know that you are not guilty - those who could make you appear so - the villains with whom you horde , and drink and brawl ! Have I ever been wrong in my warnings yet ? "
300012	300018	300033	300033	her	8909	" This is too horrible , "
300039	300058	299776	299776	his	8906	" It must be witchcraft , and nothing else . How could you learn what you tell me ? "
300059	300105	300033	300033	her	8909	" That is my affair ; enough for you that I am right . Go no more to those black haunts ; they are even now full of snares and pitfalls for you . Leave London , and you are safe . Trust to me . "
300106	300113	299776	299776	his	8906	" And where shall I go ? "
300114	300201	300215	300215	Losely	721	" Look you , Jasper ; you have worn out this old world no refuge for you but the new . Whither went your father , thither go you . Consent , and you shall not want . You can not discover Sophy . You have failed in all attempts on Darrell 's purse . But agree to sail to Australasia , and I will engage to you an income larger than you say you extorted from Poole , to be spent in those safer shores . "
300202	300213	300238	300239	The ruffian	6718	" And you will go with me , I suppose , "
300221	300237	299776	299776	his	8906	" Go with you , as you please . Be where you are - yes . "
300246	300261	300451	300452	the woman	2842	" Woman , cross me no more , or I shall be goaded into - "
300262	300444	300655	300655	he	8912	" Into killing me - you dare not ! Meet my eye if you can - you dare not ! Harm me , yea a hair of my head , and your moments are numbered ! - your doom sealed . Be we two together in a desert - not a human eye to see the deed - not a human ear to receive my groan , and still I should stand by your side unharmed . I , who have returned the wrongs received from you , by vigilant , untiring benefits - I , who have saved you from so many enemies , and so many dangers - I , who , now when all the rest of earth shun you - when all other resource fails - I , who now say to you , ' Share my income , but be honest ! ' I receive injury from that hand . No ; the guilt would be too unnatural - Heaven would not permit it . Try , and your arm will fall palsied by your side ! "
300650	300653	300655	300655	he	8912	" Well , "
300679	300693	300874	300874	you	8918	" you certainly are the best of creatures ; and , as you say ,
300891	300891	300874	300874	you	8918	"
300892	300897	300874	300874	you	8918	" Are you serious ? "
300898	300903	300874	300874	you	8918	" To be sure . "
300904	300955	300874	300874	you	8918	" Then I will inquire the days on which the vessels sail . You can call on me at my own old home , and all shall be arranged . Oh , Jasper Losely , do not avoid this last chance of escape from the perils that gather round you . "
300956	300978	301134	301134	he	0	" No ; I am sick of life - of all things except repose . Arabella , I suffer horrible pain . "
301130	301133	301134	301134	he	0	" Yes , "
301137	301197	301310	301310	Jasper	721	" I will call on you ; but meanwhile I am without a farthing . Oh , do not fear that if you helped me now , I should again shun you . I have no other resource left ; nor have I now the spirit I once had . I no longer now laugh at fatigue and danger . "
301198	301247	301134	301134	he	0	" But will you swear by all that you yet hold sacred - if , alas ! there be aught which is sacred to you - that you will not again seek the company of those men who are conspiring to entrap you into the hangman 's hands ? "
301248	301291	301307	301307	she	8926	" Seek them again , the ungrateful cowardly blackguards ! No , no ; I promise you that - solemnly ; it is medical aid that I want ; it is rest , I tell you - rest , rest , rest . "
301299	301305	302041	302041	she	3801	" Take what you will , "
302026	302039	302128	302128	she	3801	" Female , yet not faithless ; fostered , yet not ungrateful . "
302115	302127	302391	302391	he	1039	" It is a duty , and it must be done , "
302387	302390	302444	302444	She	3801	" Avaunt ! "
302395	302443	302461	302461	Darrell	1039	" Is this a spirit my own black solitude conjures up - or is it a delusion , a dream ? It is I - I ! - the Caroline dear to you once , if detested now ! Forgive me ! Not for myself I come . "
302456	302459	302519	302520	Lionel Haughton	419	" So , "
302531	302531	302516	302516	I	0	"
302532	302553	302519	302520	Lionel Haughton	419	" Oh ! Mr. Darrell , how could you have the heart to write in such terms of one who - "
302554	302763	302516	302516	I	0	" One who had taken the heart from my bosom and trampled it into the mire . True , fribbles will say , ' Fie ! the vocabulary of fine gentlemen has no harsh terms for women . ' Gallants , to whom love is pastime , leave or are left with elegant sorrow and courtly bows . Madam , I was never such airy gallant . I am but a man unhappily in earnest - a man who placed in those hands his life of life - who said to you , while yet in his prime , ' There is my future , take it , till it vanish out of earth ! You have made that life substanceless as a ghost - that future barren as the grave . And when you dare force yourself again upon my way , and would dictate laws to my very hearth - if I speak as a man what plain men must feel - ' Oh ! Mr. Darrell , ' says your injured ladyship , ' how can you have the heart ? ' Woman ! were you not false as the falsest ? Falsehood has no dignity to awe rebuke - falsehood no privilege of sex . "
302764	302788	302519	302520	Lionel Haughton	419	" Darrell - Darrell - Darrell - spare me , spare me ! I have been so punished - I am so miserable ! "
302789	302918	302516	302516	I	0	" You ! - punished ! - What ! you sold yourself to youth , and sleek looks , and grand titles , and the flattery of a world ; and your rose - leaves were crumpled in the gorgeous marriage - bed . Adequate punishment ! - a crumpled rose - leaf ! True , the man was a - but why should I speak ill of him ? It was he who was punished , if , accepting his rank , you recognised in himself a nothingness that you could neither love nor honour . False and ungrateful alike to the man you chose - to the man you forsook ! And now you have buried one , and you have schemed to degrade the other . "
302919	302953	302519	302520	Lionel Haughton	419	" Degrade ! - Oh ! it is that charge which has stung me to the quick . All the others I deserve . But that charge ! Listen - you shall listen . "
302954	302985	302996	302996	She	8982	" I stand here resigned to do so . Say all you will now , for it is the last time on earth I lend my ears to your voice . "
302986	302995	303093	303093	Darrell	512	" Be it so - the last time . "
303088	303091	303235	303235	she	8982	" Speak , "
303214	303232	303235	303235	she	8982	" I have nothing to add or to alter in the resolution I have communicated to Lionel . "
303250	303308	303313	303313	she	8982	" My happiness ? Oh ! well have you proved the sincerity with which you schemed for that ! Save me from self - reproach - me ! Has Lady Montfort so wholly forgotten that she was once Caroline Lyndsay that she can assume the part of a warning angel against the terrors of self - reproach ? "
303309	303312	303313	303313	she	8982	" Ah ! "
303317	303332	303337	303337	he	419	" can you suppose , however fickle and thankless I may seem to you - "
303333	303336	303344	303344	she	8982	" Seem ! "
303340	303343	303497	303497	I	0	" Seem ! "
303487	303496	303533	303533	you	419	" a deep blush came over her cheek . "
303543	303543	303549	303549	Darrell	512	"
303544	303547	303549	303549	Darrell	512	" Ay , "
303552	303709	303793	303793	Woman	458	" ay , do not fear that I should misconceive you ; you would not so have addressed the young , the fair , the happy . No ! you , proud beauty , with hosts , no doubt , of supplicating wooers , would have thrust that hand into the flames before it wrote to a young man , loved as the young are loved , what without shame it wrote to the old man , reverenced as the old are reverenced ! But my heart is not old , and your boasted reverence was a mocking insult . Your letter , torn to pieces , was returned to you without a word - insult for insult ! You felt no shame that I should so rudely reject your pity . Why should you ? Rejected pity is not rejected love . The man was not less old because he was not reconciled to age . "
303797	303805	303807	303807	she	8987	" I have injured you - forgive ! "
303812	303820	303850	303850	he	8987	" You disdain me , but love ! "
303846	303849	303850	303850	he	8987	" Ah ! "
303872	303985	304037	304037	His	8988	" Ah ! I said to myself , ' Oh , she believes that she has been so mourned and missed that my soul would spring back to her false smile ; that I could be so base a slave to my senses as to pardon the traitress because her face was fair enough to haunt my dreams . She dupes herself ; she is no necessity to my existence - I have wrenched it from her power years , long years ago ! I will show her , since again she deigns to remember me , that I am not so old as to be grateful for the leavings of a heart .
303986	304014	303850	303850	he	8987	" I will love another - I will be beloved . She shall not say with secret triumph , ' The old man dotes in rejecting me ' "
304015	304030	304037	304037	His	8988	" Darrell , Darrel - unjus - cruel kill me rather than talk thus ! "
304072	304420	304432	304432	Caroline	846	" But - you have the triumph ; see , I am still alone ! I sought the world of the young - the marriage mart of the Beautiful once more . Alas ! if my eye was captured for a moment , it was by something that reminded me of you . I saw a faultless face , radiant with its virgin blush ; moved to it , I drew near - sighing , turned away ; it was not you ! I heard the silvery laugh of a life fresh as an April morn . ' Hark ! ' I said , ' is not that the sweet mirth - note at which all my cares were dispelled ? Listening , I forgot my weight of years . Why ? because listening , I remembered you . ' Heed not the treacherous blush and the beguiling laugh , ' whispered Prudence . ' Seek in congenial mind a calm companion to thine own . ' Mind ! O frigid pedantry ! Mind ! - had not yours been a volume open to my eyes ; in every page , methought , some lovely poet - truth never revealed to human sense before ! No ; you had killed to me all womanhood ! Woo another ! - we d another ! ' Hush , ' I said , ' it shall be . Eighteen years since we parted - seeing her not , she remains eternally the same ! Seeing her again , the very change that time must have brought will cure . I saw you - all the past rushed back in that stolen moment . I fled - never more to dream that I can shake off the curse of memory - blent with each drop of my blood - woven with each tissue - throbbing in each nerve - bone of my bone , and flesh of my flesh - poison - root from which every thought buds to wither - the curse to have loved and to have trusted you ! "
304421	304430	304432	304432	Caroline	846	" Merciful Heaven ! can I bear this ? "
304441	304567	304576	304578	the unrelenting man	8989	" And is my sin so great - is it so unpardonable ? Oh , if in a heart so noble , in a nature so great , mine was the unspeakable honour to inspire an affection thus enduring , must it be only - only - as a curse ! Why can I not repair the past ? You have not ceased to love me . Call it hate - it is love still ! And now , no barrier between our lives , can I never , never again - never , now that I know I am less unworthy of you by the very anguish I feel to have so stung you - can I never again be the Caroline of old ? "
304568	304573	306642	306643	Guy Darrell	1039	" Ha , ha ! "
305175	305290	305295	305295	he	0	" He paused a moment , heeding not her bitter weeping ; he was rapt from the present hour itself by the excess of that anguish which is to woe what ecstasy is to joy - swept along by the flood of thoughts that had been pent within his breast through the solitary days and haunted nights , which had made the long transition state from his manhood 's noon to its gathering eve . And in that pause there came from afar off a melodious , melancholy strain - softly , softly borne over the cold blue waters - softly , softly through the sere autumnal leaves - the music of the magic flute !
305291	305294	305295	305295	he	0	" Hark ! "
305298	305851	306642	306643	Guy Darrell	1039	" do you not remember ? Look to that beech - tree yonder ! Summer clothed it then ! Do you not remember ! as under that tree we stood - that same , same note came , musical as now , undulating with rise and fall - came , as if to interpret , by a voice from fairyland , the beating of my own mysterious heart . You had been pleading for pardon to one less ungrateful - less perfidious - than my comforter proved herself . I had listened to you , wondering why anger and wrong seemed banished from the world ; and I murmured , in answer , without conscious thought of myself : ' Happy the man whose faults your bright charity will admonish - whose griefs your tenderness will chase away ! But when , years hence , children are born to yourself , spare me the one who shall most resemble you , to replace the daughter whom I can only sincerely pardon when something else can spring up to my desolate being - something that I can cherish without the memory of falsehood and the dread of shame . ' Yes , as I ceased , came that music ; and as it thrilled through the summer air , I turned and met your eyes - turned and saw you blush - turned and heard some faint faltering words drowning the music with diviner sweetness ; and suddenly I knew , as by a revelation , that the Child I had fostered had grown the Woman I loved . My own soul was laid bare to me by the flash of hope . Over the universe rushed light and colour ! Oh , the Caroline of old ! What wonder that she became so fatally , so unspeakably beloved ! As some man in ancient story , banished from his native land , is told by an oracle to seek a happier isle in undiscovered seas - freights with his all a single bark - collects on his wandering altar the last embers of his abandoned hearth - places beside it his exiled household gods ; so all that my life had left to me , hallowing and hallowed , I stored in you .... I tore myself from the old native soil , the old hardy skies . Through time 's wide ocean I saw but the promised golden isle . Fables , fables ! - lying oracle ! - sunken vessel ! - visionary isle ! And life to me had till then been so utterly without love ! - had passed in such hard labours , without a holyday of romance - all the fountains of the unknown passion sealed till the spell struck the rock , and every wave , every drop sparkled fresh to a single star . Yet my boyhood , like other men 's , had dreamed of its Ideal . There at last that Ideal , come to life , bloomed before me ; there , under those beech - trees - the Caroline of old . O wretched woman , now weeping at my side , well may you weep ! Never can earth give you back such love as you lost in mine . "
305852	305869	305295	305295	he	0	" I know it , I know it - fool that I was - miserable fool ! "
305870	306218	306642	306643	Guy Darrell	1039	" Ay , but comfort yourself - wilder and sadder folly in myself ! Your mother was right . ' The vain child , ' she said , ' knows not her own heart . She is new to the world - has seen none of her own years . For your sake , as for hers , I must insist on the experiment of absence . A year 's ordeal - see if she is then of the same mind . ' I marvelled at her coldness ; proudly I submitted to her seasonings ; fearlessly I confided the result to you . Ah ! how radiant was your smile , when , in the parting hour , I said , ' Summer and you will return again ! ' In vain , on pretence that the experiment should be complete , did your mother carry you abroad , and exact from us both the solemn promise that not even a letter should pass between us - that our troth , made thus conditional , should be a secret to all - in vain , if meant to torture me with doubt . In my creed , a doubt is itself a treason . How lovely grew the stern face of Ambition ! - how Fame seemed as a messenger from me to you ! In the sound of applause I said ' They can not shut out the air that will carry that sound to her ears ! All that I can win from honour shall be my marriage gifts to my queenly bride . ' See that arrested pile - begun at my son 's birth , stopped awhile at his death , recommenced on a statelier plan when I thought of your footstep on its floors - your shadow on its walls . Stopped now forever ! Architects can build a palace ; can they build a home ? But you - you - you , all the while - your smile on another 's suit - your thoughts on another 's hearth ! "
306219	306263	305295	305295	he	0	" Not so ! - not so ! Your image never forsook me . I was giddy , thoughtless , dazzled , entangled ; and I told you in the letter you returned to me - told you that I had been deceived ! "
306264	306626	307059	307059	you	9028	" Patience - patience ! Deceived ! Do you imagine that I do not see all that passed as in a magician 's glass ? Caroline Montfort , you never loved me ; you never knew what love was . Thrown suddenly into the gay world , intoxicated by the effect of your own beauty , my sombre figure gradually faded dim - pale ghost indeed in the atmosphere of flowers and lustres , rank with the breath of flatterers . Then came my lord the Marquess - a cousin privileged to familiar intimacy to visit at will , to ride with you , dance with you , sit side by side with you in quiet corners of thronging ball - rooms , to call you ' Caroline . ' Tut , tut - they are only cousins , and cousins are as brothers and sisters in the affectionate House of Vipont ; and gossips talk , and young ladies envy - finest match in all England is the pretty - faced Lord of Montfort ! And your mother , who had said , ' Wait a year ' to Guy Darrell , must have dreamed of the cousin , and schemed for his coronet , when she said it . And I was unseen , and I must not write ; and the absent are always in the wrong - when cousins are present ! And I hear your mother speak of me - hear the soft sound of her damaging praises . ' Another long speech from your clever admirer ! Do n't fancy he frets ; that kind of man thinks of nothing but blue - books and politics . ' And your cousin proposes , and you say with a sigh , ' No ; I am bound to Guy Darrell ' ; and your mother says to my Lord , ' Wait , and still come - as a cousin ! ' And then , day by day , the sweet Mrs. Lyndsay drops into your ear the hints that shall poison your heart . Some fable is dressed to malign me ; and you cry , "
307075	307075	307087	307089	the miserable woman	9044	"
307076	307085	307087	307089	the miserable woman	9044	" I ask nothing - not even pardon , "
307091	307115	307329	307329	Darrell	1039	" I might say something to show where you misjudge me - something that might palliate ; but no , let it be . "
307321	307325	307337	307337	she	9044	" Lady Montfort , "
307340	307349	307329	307329	Darrell	1039	" I have addressed you rudely - harshly - "
307350	307355	307337	307337	she	9044	" No - no - "
307356	307446	307449	307449	her	9044	" But that was the last exercise of a right which I now resign for ever . I spoke to her who had once been Caroline Lyndsay ; some gentler words are due to the widow of Lord Montfort . Whatever the wrongs you have inflicted on me - wrongs inexpiable - I recognise no less in your general nature qualities that would render you , to one whom you really loved , and had never deceived , the blessing I had once hoped you would prove to me . "
307455	307498	307337	307337	she	9044	" I know that in an ill - assorted union , and amidst all the temptations to which flattered beauty is exposed , your conduct has been without reproach . Forget the old man whose thoughts should now be on his grave . "
307499	307508	307449	307449	her	9044	" Hush , hush - have human mercy ! "
307509	307612	308712	308712	Darrell	972	" I withdraw and repent my injustice to your motives in the protection you have given to the poor girl whom Lionel would we d ; I thank you for that protection , - though I refuse consent to my kinsman 's prayer . Whatever her birth , I must be glad to know that she whom Lionel so loves is safe from a wretch like Losely . More - one word more - wait - it is hard for me to say it - be happy ! I can not pardon , but I can bless you . Farewell for ever ! "
308706	308710	308712	308712	Darrell	972	" Darrell Montfort . "
308715	308730	309196	309196	she	907	" On the whole , such a marriage would have pleased my poor father . "
309209	309240	309241	309242	The Head	9128	" There is but one kind of wife , my dear Montfort , who could increase your importance : you should marry a beauty ; next to royalty ranks beauty . "
309266	309269	309578	309578	she	907	" Shoes . "
309555	309573	309836	309836	her	907	" for Caroline is coquettish , Mr. Darrell ; most girls so pretty are at that silly age "
309840	309843	310400	310402	Dear Guy Darrell	1039	" cousins , "
310415	310514	310606	310606	Caroline	846	" Something , my dear child , in your own artless words and manner , that made him fancy he had won your affections unknown to yourself ! - an idea that he was bound as a gentleman to speak out ! Just like him . He has that spirit of chivalry . But my belief is , that he is quite aware by this time how foolish such a marriage would be , and would thank you heartily if , at the year 's end , he found himself free , and you happily disposed of elsewhere , "
310618	310644	310572	310572	her	846	" Were this true , all would be indeed at an end between us ! But it is not true . Let it be proved . "
310645	310721	310606	310606	Caroline	846	" But , my dear , dear child , I could not stir in a matter so delicate . I could not aid in breaking off a marriage so much to your worldly advantage , unless you could promise that , in rejecting Mr. Darrell , you would accept your cousin . In my wretched state of health , the anxious thought of leaving you in the world literally penniless would kill me at once . "
310722	310756	311737	311738	the Marquess	4469	" Oh , if Guy Darrell be false but that is impossible ! do with me all you will ; to obey and please you would be the only comfort left to me . "
311743	311753	312338	312338	Gabrielle	836	" I do n't find that it produces honey . "
312342	312407	313020	313020	his	737	" Do so , and I will take care that your father shall know that your plea for his pardon through Madame la Baronne was a scheme to blacken his name , and to frustrate his marriage . Do not think that he will suppose you did not connive at a project so sly ; he must know you too well , pretty innocent . "
313025	313160	315277	315277	he	1319	" I beg never to hear again of this lawyer and his very disreputable family connections . As you say , you and your mother have behaved very ill to him ; but you do n't seem to understand that you have behaved much worse to me . As to condescending to write to him , and enter into explanations how you came to be Lady Montfort , it would be so lowering to me that I would never forgive it - never . I would just as soon that you run away at once ; - sooner . As for Mrs. Lyndsay , I shall forbid her entering my house . When you have done crying , order your things to be packed up . I shall return to England to - morrow . "
315267	315275	315277	315277	he	1319	" I have but one wish now , "
315279	315451	315461	315461	Alban	628	" and that is to change at once into some regiment on active service . I do not talk of courting danger and seeking death . That would be either a senseless commonplace , or a threat , as it were , to Heaven ! But I need some vehemence of action - some positive and irresistible call upon honour or duty that may force me to contend against this strange heaviness that settles down on my whole life . Therefore , I entreat you so to arrange for me , and break it to Mr. Darrell in such terms as may not needlessly pain him by the obtrusion of my sufferings . For , while I know him well enough to be convinced that nothing could move him from resolves in which he had entrenched , as in a citadel , his pride or his creed of honour , I am sure that he would take into his own heart all the grief which those resolves occasioned to another 's . "
315452	315459	315461	315461	Alban	628	" You do him justice there , "
315463	315491	315501	315501	Lionel	419	" you are a noble fellow to understand him so well ! Sir , you have in you the stuff that makes English gentlemen such generous soldiers . "
315492	315499	315501	315501	Lionel	419	" Action , action , action , "
315503	315523	315553	315553	we	9338	" Strife , strife ! No other chance of cure . Rest is so crushing , solitude so dismal . "
315556	315561	315614	315614	she	926	" Action - Strife ! "
315633	315636	315704	315704	he	419	" FAITH ! "
315695	315703	315704	315704	he	419	" Was there ever such untoward luck , "
315712	315786	315792	315792	Lionel	419	" that out of the whole world you should fall in love with the very girl against whom Darrell 's feelings prejudices if you please must be mailed in adamant ! Convinced , and apparently with every reason , that she is not his daughter 's child , but , however innocently , an impostor , how can he receive her as his young kinsman 's bride ? How can we expect it ? "
315787	315790	315792	315792	Lionel	419	" But , "
315794	315820	315704	315704	he	419	" if , on farther investigation , she prove to be his daughter 's child - the sole surviving representative of his line and name ? "
315821	315913	315792	315792	Lionel	419	" His name ! No ! Of the name of Losely - the name of that turbulent sharper , who may yet die on the gibbet - of that poor , dear , lovable rascal Willy , who was goose enough to get himself transported for robbery ! - a felon 's grandchild the representative of Darrell 's line ! But how on earth came Lady Montfort to favour so wild a project , and encourage you to share in it ? - she who ought to have known Darrell better ? "
315914	316009	315704	315704	he	419	" Alas ! she saw but Sophy 's exquisite , simple virtues , and inborn grace ; and , believing her claim to Darrell 's lineage , Lady Montfort thought but of the joy and blessing one so good and so loving might bring to his joyless hearth . She was not thinking of morbid pride and mouldering ancestors , but of soothing charities and loving ties . And Lady Montfort , I now suspect , in her scheme for our happiness - for Darrell 's - had an interest which involved her own ! "
316010	316014	315792	315792	Lionel	419	" Her own ! "
316015	316024	315704	315704	he	419	" Yes ; I see it all now . "
316025	316033	315792	315792	Lionel	419	" See what ? you puzzle me . "
316034	316055	315704	315704	he	419	" I told you that Darrell , in his letter to me , wrote with great bitterness of Lady Montfort . "
316056	316070	315792	315792	Lionel	419	" Very natural that he should . Who would not resent such interference ? "
316071	316115	315704	315704	he	419	" Listen . I told you that , at his own command , I sent to her that letter ; that she , on receiving it , went herself to Fawley , to plead our cause . I was sanguine of the result . "
316116	316119	315792	315792	Lionel	419	" Why ? "
316120	316168	316174	316178	the Man of the World	4961	" Because he who is in love has a wondrous intuition into all the mysteries of love in others ; and when I read Darrell 's letter I felt sure that he had once loved - loved still , perhaps - the woman he so vehemently reproached . "
316169	316172	316182	316183	Guy Darrell	1039	" Ha ! "
316190	316584	316659	316659	he	2194	" Ha ! is it possible ! And they say that I know everything ! You were sanguine , - I understand . Yes , if your belief were true - if there were some old attachment that could be revived - some old misunderstanding explained away - stop ; let me think . True , true - it was just after her marriage that he fled from the world . Ah , my dear Lionel ; light , light ! light dawns on me ! Not without reason were you sanguine . Your hand , my dear boy ; I see hope for you at last . For if the sole reason that prevented Darrell contracting a second marriage was the unconquered memory of a woman like Lady Montfort where , indeed , her equal in beauty , in disposition so akin to his own ideal of womanly excellence ? - and if she too has some correspondent sentiment for him , why then , indeed , you might lose all chance of being Darrell 's sole heir ; your Sophy might forfeit the hateful claim to be the sole scion on his ancient tree ; but it is precisely by those losses that Lionel Haughton might gain the bride he covets ; and if this girl prove to be what these Loselys affirm , that very marriage , which is now so repugnant to Darrell , ought to insure his blessing . Were he himself to marry again - had he rightful representatives and heirs in his own sons - he should rejoice in the nuptials that secured to his daughter 's child so honourable a name and so tender a protector . And as for inheritance , you have not been reared to expect it ; you have never counted on it . You would receive a fortune sufficiently ample to restore your ancestral station ; your career will add honours to fortune . Yes , yes ; that is the sole way out of all these difficulties . Darrell must marry again ; Lady Montfort must be his wife . Lionel shall be free to choose her whom Lady Montfort approves - be friends - no matter what her birth ; and I - I - Alban Morley - shall have an arm - chair by two smiling hearths . "
316675	316699	316706	316706	Lionel	419	" Lose not a minute - come with me instantly - as you value the safety , perhaps the life of Guy Darrell ! "
316700	316704	316724	316724	she	9343	" Guy Darrell ! "
316718	316723	316724	316724	she	9343	" Who are you ? "
316730	316738	316754	316755	the Colonel	13877	" are you one of his family ? "
316739	316752	316754	316755	the Colonel	13877	" His kinsman - almost his adopted son - Mr. Lionel Haughton , "
316757	316768	316724	316724	she	9343	" But pardon me , madam - who are you ? "
316769	316822	316754	316755	the Colonel	13877	" Do you not remember me ? Yet you were so often in Darrell 's house that you must have seen my face , as you have learned from your friend how little cause I have to care for him or his . Look again ; I am that Arabella Fossett who - "
316823	316832	316905	316905	she	9346	" Ah , I remember now ; but - "
316833	316904	316905	316905	she	9346	" But I tell you that Darrell is in danger , and this night . Take money ; to be in time you must hire a special train . Take arms , though to be used only in self - defence . Take your servant if he is brave . This young kinsman - let him come too . There is only one man to resist ; but that man , "
316915	316993	316999	316999	she	9346	" would have the strength and courage of ten were his cause not that which may make the strong man weak , and the bold man craven . It is not a matter for the officers of justice , for law , for scandal ; the service is to be done in secret , by friends , by kinsmen ; for the danger that threatens Darrell - stoop - stoop , Colonel Morley - close in your ear "
317002	317076	317485	317485	he	1039	" for the danger that threatens Darrell in his house this night is from the man whose name his daughter bore . That is why I come to you . To you I need not say , ' Spare his life - Jasper Losely 's life . ' Jasper Losely 's death as a midnight robber would be Darrell 's intolerable shame . Quick , quick , quick ! - come , come ! "
317480	317484	317485	317485	he	1039	" Mr. Darrell , "
317488	317507	317538	317538	Darrell	512	" I come here again to see you ; vouchsafe me , this time , a calmer hearing . "
317532	317536	317538	317538	Darrell	512	" Another time , "
317547	317555	317564	317564	Losely	721	" I am not at leisure now . "
317556	317562	317564	317564	Losely	721	" Pardon me , NOW , "
317583	317602	317896	317896	Darrell	512	" You do not remember me , sir ; no wonder . But my name is Jasper Losely . "
317904	317995	318007	318007	Losely	721	" You have heard , sir , I believe , through Colonel Morley , that only on condition of your permanent settlement in one of our distant colonies , or America if you prefer it , would I consent to assist you . I am of the same mind still . I can not parley with you myself . Colonel Morley is abroad , I believe . I refer you to my solicitor ; you have seen him years ago ; you know his address . No more , sir . "
317996	318005	318014	318014	himself	721	" This will not do , Mr. Darrell , "
318021	318044	318051	318051	Darrell	512	" I have come here on purpose to have all differences out with you , face to face - and I will - "
318045	318049	318177	318177	he	512	" You will ! "
318172	318176	318177	318177	he	512	" You will ! "
318180	318215	318142	318142	He	512	" Well , be it so . Are you come again to tell me that a child of my daughter lives , and that you won my daughter 's fortune by a deliberate lie ? "
318216	318366	318177	318177	he	512	" I am not come to speak of that girl , but of myself . I say that I have a claim on you , Mr. Darrell ; I say that turn and twist the truth as you will , you are still my father - in - law , and that it is intolerable that I should be wanting bread , or driven into actual robbery , while my wife 's father is a man of countless wealth , and has no heir except - but I will not now urge that child 's cause ; I am content to abandon it if so obnoxious to you . Do you wish me to cut a throat , and to be hanged , and all the world to hear the last dying speech and confession of Guy Darrell 's son - in - law ? Answer me , sir ? "
318367	318475	318485	318485	Jasper	721	" I answer you briefly and plainly . It is simply because I would not have that last disgrace on Guy Darrell 's name that I offer you a subsistence in lands where you will be less exposed to those temptations which induced you to invest the sums that , by your own tale , had been obtained from me on false pretences , in the sink of a Paris gambling house . A subsistence that , if it does not pamper vice , at least places you beyond the necessity of crime , is at your option . Choose it or reject it as you will . "
318476	318483	318485	318485	Jasper	721	" Look you , Mr. Darrell , "
318507	318539	318545	318545	Darrell	512	" I am in a state so desperate , that , rather than starve , I may take what you so contemptuously fling to - your daughter 's husband ; but - "
318540	318543	318545	318545	Darrell	512	" Knave ! "
318550	318608	318485	318485	Jasper	721	" do you again and again urge it as a claim upon me , that you decoyed from her home , under a false name , my only child ; that she died in a foreign land - broken - hearted , if I have rightly heard is that a claim upon your duped victim 's father ? "
318609	318941	318947	318947	Darrell	512	" It seems so , since your pride is compelled to own that the world would deem it one , if the jail chaplain took down the last words of your son - in - law ! But , basta , basta ! hear me out , and spare hard names ; for the blood is mounting into my brain , and I may become dangerous . Had any other man eyed , and scoffed , and railed at me as you have done , he would be lying dead and dumb as this stone at my foot ; but you - are my father - in - law ! Now , I care not to bargain with you what be the precise amount of my stipend if I obey your wish , and settle miserably in one of those raw , comfortless corners into which they who burthen this Old World are thrust out of sight . I would rather live my time out in this country - live it out in peace and for half what you may agree to give in transporting me . If you are to do anything for me , you had better do it so as to make me contented on easy terms to your own pockets , rather than to leave me dissatisfied , and willing to annoy you , which I could do somehow or other , even on the far side of the Herring Pond . I might keep to the letter of a bargain , live in Melbourne or Sydney , and take your money , and yet molest and trouble you by deputy . That girl , for instance - your grandchild ; well , well , disown her if you please ; but if I find out where she is , which I own I have not done yet , I might contrive to render her the plague of your life , even though I were in Australia . "
318942	318945	318961	318961	himself	512	" Ay , "
318951	318957	318961	318961	himself	512	" ay , ay ; but "
318964	319053	318485	318485	Jasper	721	" No ! Man , if she were my grandchild , your own child , could you talk of her thus ? make her the object of so base a traffic , and such miserable threats ? Wicked though you be , this were against nature ! even in nature 's wickedness - even in the son of a felon , and in the sharper of a hell . Pooh ! I despise your malice . I will listen to you no longer . Out of my path . "
319054	319057	318961	318961	himself	512	" No ! "
319058	319061	318485	318485	Jasper	721	" No ? "
319062	319197	319381	319381	Jasper	721	" No , Guy Darrell , I have not yet done ; you shall hear my terms , and accept them - a moderate sum down ; say a few hundreds , and two hundred a - year to spend in London as I will - but out of your beat , out of your sight and hearing . Grant this , and I will never cross you again - never attempt to find , and , if I find by chance , never claim as my child by your daughter that wandering girl . I will never shame you by naming our connection . I will not offend the law , nor die by the hangman ; yet I shall not live long , for I suffer much , and I drink hard . "
319373	319379	319381	319381	Jasper	721	" You see , sir , "
319388	319423	319433	319433	Jasper	721	" that there is no dog so toothless but what he can bite , and no dog so savage but what , if you give him plenty to eat , he will serve you . "
319436	319535	319542	319542	Darrell	512	" I have hinted how I might plague you ; perhaps , on the other hand , I might do you a good turn with that handsome lady who drove from your park - gate as I came up . Ah ! you were once to have been married to her . I read in the newspapers that she has become a widow ; you may marry her yet . There was a story against you once ; her mother made use of it , and broke off an old engagement . I can set that story right . "
319536	319540	319542	319542	Darrell	512	" You can , "
319554	319584	319590	319590	Jasper	721	" and perhaps , sir , that story , whatever it might be , you invented . No dog so toothless as not to bite - eh , sir ? "
319585	319588	319590	319590	Jasper	721	" Well , "
319597	319650	319776	319776	Losely	721	" at that time certainly it seemed my interest that you should not marry again ; but basta ! basta ! enough of bygones . If I bit once , I will serve now . Come , sir , you are a man of the world , let us close the bargain . "
319785	319866	321738	321738	he	954	" Execrable villain ! I revoke every offer to aid a life that has existed but to darken and desolate those it was permitted to approach . Starve or rob ! perish miserably ! And if I pour not on your head my parting curse , it is only because I know that man has no right to curse ; and casting you back on your own evil self is the sole revenge which my belief in Heaven permits me . "
321749	321752	322323	322324	a man	1281	" lost , "
322340	322343	322389	322389	he	954	" elderly . "
322392	322425	322434	322434	Jasper	721	" As yet things look promising - place still as death - only one door locked , and that the common country lock , which a schoolboy might pick with his knife . "
322426	322432	322389	322389	he	954	" Or a crooked nail , "
322436	322457	322860	322860	yourself	9540	" Ay , no better picklock in good hands . But there are other things besides locks to think of . "
322814	322817	322833	322833	his	954	" Circumstance , "
322819	322822	322860	322860	yourself	9540	" Chance , "
322824	322827	322860	322860	yourself	9540	" Fate , "
322862	322890	323304	323306	the strong man	2645	" For what I suffer I condemn another man , or I accuse the Arch - Invisible , be it a Destiny , be it a Maker ! "
323271	323295	323392	323394	the vindictive dreamer	9558	" None now can deliver you from me - I come no more as a suppliant - I command you to accept my terms "
323372	323390	323415	323415	he	954	" Oh that my enemy were but before me face to face - none to part us ! "
323422	323438	323415	323415	he	954	" Why , then another murder will be added to the long catalogue from Cain . "
323454	323463	323499	323499	Losely	721	" Why , then - come what may ! "
323512	323520	323543	323543	Jasper	721	" And then ! come what may ! "
323538	323541	323550	323550	Cutts	954	" Well ! "
323545	323548	323550	323550	Cutts	954	" Mount ! "
323552	323562	323571	323571	Cutts	954	" I have much to say as we ride . "
323563	323569	323571	323571	Cutts	954	" This will not do , "
323581	323633	323639	323639	Jasper	721	" why , you never told me all the drawbacks . There are no less than four men in the house - two servants besides the master and his secretary ; and one of those servants , the butler or valet , has firearms , and knows how to use them . "
323634	323637	323639	323639	Jasper	721	" Pshaw ! "
323642	323655	323571	323571	Cutts	954	" is that all ? Am I not a match for four ? "
323656	323715	323639	323639	Jasper	721	" No , it is not all ; you told me the master of the house was a retired elderly man , and you mentioned his name . But you never told me that your Mr. Darrell was the famous lawyer and Parliament man - a man about whom the newspapers have been writing the last six months . "
323716	323722	323571	323571	Cutts	954	" What does that signify ? "
323723	323871	323639	323639	Jasper	721	" Signify ! Just this , that there will be ten times more row about the affair you propose than there would be if it concerned only a stupid old country squire , and therefore ten times as much danger . Besides , on principle I do n't like to have anything to do with lawyers - a cantankerous , spiteful set of fellows . And this Guy Darrell ! Why , General Jas . , I have seen the man . He cross - examined me once when I was a witness on a case of fraud , and turned me inside out with as much ease as if I had been an old pincushion stuffed with bran . I think I see his eye now , and I would as lief have a loaded pistol at my head as that eye again fixed on mine . "
323872	323897	323571	323571	Cutts	954	" Pooh ! You have brought a mask ; and , besides , YOU need not see him ; I can face him alone . "
323898	324086	324095	324095	Jasper	721	" No , no ; there might be murder ! I never mix myself with things of that kind , on principle ; your plan will not do . There might be a much safer chance of more swag in a very different sort of scheme . I hear that the pictures in that ghostly long room I crept through are worth a mint of money . Now , pictures of great value are well known , and there are collectors abroad who would pay almost any price for some pictures , and never ask where they came from ; hide them for some years perhaps , and not bring them forth till any tales that would hurt us had died away . This would be safe , I say . If the pictures are small , no one in the old house need be disturbed . I can learn from some of the trade what pictures Darrell really has that would fetch a high price , and then look out for customers abroad . This will take a little time , but be worth waiting for . "
324087	324093	324095	324095	Jasper	721	" I will not wait , "
324099	324134	324162	324162	he	954	" and you are a coward . I have resolved that to - morrow night I will be in that man 's room , and that man shall be on his knees before me . "
324155	324161	324162	324162	he	954	" Oh , I see , "
324165	324191	324206	324206	Jasper	721	" there is more than robbery in your mind . You have some feeling of hate - of vengeance ; the man has injured you ? "
324192	324204	324206	324206	Jasper	721	" He has treated me as if I were a dog , "
324208	324215	324216	324216	Cutts	954	" and a dog can bite . "
324222	324250	324162	324162	he	954	" I have heard you talk at times about some rich relation or connection on whom you had claims ; Darrell is the man , I suppose ? "
324251	324326	324216	324216	Cutts	954	" He is ; and hark ye , Cutts , if you try to balk me here , I will wring your neck off . And since I have told you so much , I will tell you this much more - that I do n't think there is the danger you count on ; for I do n't mean to take Darrell 's blood , and I believe he would not take mine . "
324327	324338	324354	324354	Jasper	721	" But there may be a struggle - and then ? "
324339	324352	324709	324709	he	9574	" Ay , if so , and then - man to man , "
324716	324726	325859	325859	himself	2259	" to have nothing to do with the bullocks . "
325861	325868	326592	326592	his	512	" These are for far posterity , "
326597	326636	326680	326680	he	512	" Hold , sir ; I forbid you to advance another step . You are here , no matter how , to re - urge your claims on me . Be seated ; I will listen to you . "
326676	326679	326680	326680	he	512	" Ah ! "
326683	326697	326720	326721	The ruffian	6718	" you will listen to me now ; but my terms have risen . "
326729	326738	326720	326721	The ruffian	6718	" My terms have risen , Mr. Darrell . "
326739	326748	326720	326721	The ruffian	6718	" Have they , sir ? and why ? "
326749	326777	326720	326721	The ruffian	6718	" Why ! Because no one can come to your aid here ; because here you can not escape ; because here you are in my power ! "
326778	326807	326720	326721	The ruffian	6718	" Rather , sir , I listen to you because here you are under my roof - tree ; and it is you who are in my power ! "
326808	326850	326720	326721	The ruffian	6718	" Yours ! Look round ; the doors are locked on you . Perhaps you think your shouts , your cries might bring aid to you . Attempt it - raise your voice - and I strangle you with these hands . "
326851	326941	326720	326721	The ruffian	6718	" If I do not raise my voice , it is , first , because I should be ashamed of myself if I required aid against one man ; and , secondly , because I would not expose to my dependents a would - be assassin in him whom my lost child called husband . Hush , sir , hush , or your own voice will alarm those who sleep below . And now , what is it you ask ? Be plain , sir , and be brief . "
326942	326991	326720	326721	The ruffian	6718	" Well , if you like to take matters coolly , I have no objection . These are my terms . You have received large sums this day ; those sums are in your house , probably in that bureau ; and your life is at my will . "
326992	327132	326720	326721	The ruffian	6718	" You ask the monies paid for rent to - day . True , they are in the house ; but they are not in my apartments . They were received by another ; they are kept by another . In vain , through the windings and passages of this old house , would you seek to find the room in which he stores them . In doing so you will pass by the door of a servant who sleeps so lightly that the chances are that he will hear you ; he is armed with a blunderbuss , and with pistols . You say to me , ' Your money or your life . ' I say to you , in reply , ' Neither : attempt to seize the money , and your own life is lost . "
327133	327223	327237	327237	Darrell	512	" Miser ! I do n't believe that sums so large are not in your own keeping . And even if they are not , you shall show me where they are ; you shall lead me through those windings and passages of which you so tenderly warn me , my hand on your throat . And if servants wake , or danger threaten me , it is you who shall save me , or die ! Ha ! you do not fear me - eh , Mr. Darrell ! "
327228	327235	327237	327237	Darrell	512	" I do not fear you , "
327242	327355	327407	327407	Jasper	721	" I can not conceive that you are here with no other design than a profitless murder . You are here , you say , to make terms ; it will be time enough to see whose life is endangered when all your propositions have been stated . As yet you have only suggested a robbery , to which you ask me to assist you . Impossible ! Grant even that you were able to murder me , you would be just as far off from your booty . And yet you say your terms have risen ! To me they seem fallen to nothing ! Have you anything else to say ? "
327419	327502	327503	327503	Darrell	512	" Well , Mr. Darrell , it is all one to me how I wring from you , in your own house , what you refused me when I was a suppliant on the road . Fair means are pleasanter than foul . I am a gentleman - the grandson of Sir Julian Losely , of Losely Hall ; I am your son - in - law ; and I am starving . This must not be ; write me a cheque . "
327518	327616	327669	327669	Losely	1027	" Oho ! you do n't fear me , eh ? This is not done from fear , mind - all out of pure love and compassion , my kind father - in - law . You will write me a cheque for five thousand pounds - come , I am moderate - your life is worth a precious deal more than that . Hand me the cheque - I will trust to your honour to give me no trouble in cashing it , and bid you good - night - my father - in - law . "
327674	327684	327697	327697	Darrell	512	" What means that ? What have you done ? "
327685	327695	327697	327697	Darrell	512	" Saved your life and mine , Jasper Losely , "
327711	327719	327726	327727	the tiger	9648	" We are now upon equal terms . "
327720	327724	327726	327727	the tiger	9648	" I understand , "
327737	327751	327872	327872	Darrell	512	" you think by that paper to summon some one to your aid . "
327752	327871	327891	327891	Darrell	512	" Not so - that paper is useless while I live . Look forth - the moonlight is on the roofs below - can you see where that paper has fallen ? On the ledge of a parapet that your foot could not reach . It faces the window of a room in which one of my household sleeps ; it will meet his eye in the morning when the shutters are unbarred ; and on that paper are writ these words : ' If I am this night murdered , the murderer is Jasper Losely , ' and the paper is signed by my name . Back , sir - would you doom yourself to the gibbet ? "
327894	327942	328013	328014	The robber	9616	" And now I tell you plainly that I can accede to no terms put to me thus . I can sign my hand to no order that you may dictate , because that would be to sign myself a coward - and my name is Darrell ! "
327943	328012	328161	328161	Darrell	512	" Down on your knees , proud man - sign you shall , and on your knees ! I care not now for gold - I care not now a rush for my life . I came here to humble the man who from first to last has so scornfully humbled me . - And I will , I will ! On your knees - on your knees ! "
328148	328159	328161	328161	Darrell	512	" Stay , stay , stay , parricide and madman ! "
328171	328239	328497	328497	Losely	721	" It is not my life I plead for - it is yours . Remember , if I fall by your hand , no hope and no refuge are left to you ! In the name of my dead child , and under the eye of avenging Heaven , I strike down the fury that blinds you , and I scare back your soul from the abyss ! "
328361	328371	328397	328397	Losely	721	" Open , open ! - Darrell , Darrell ! "
328388	328395	328397	328397	Losely	721	" Ho - is it so ? "
328406	328430	328436	328436	Darrell	512	" But do not think that I will be caught thus , like a rat in a trap . No - I will - "
328431	328434	328502	328502	he	512	" Hist ! "
328449	328490	328546	328546	Darrell	512	" Hist ! - let no one know that my daughter 's husband came here with a felon 's purpose . Sit down - down I say ; it is for my house 's honour that you should be safe . "
328537	328544	328690	328690	Darrell	512	" The key - the key ! "
328695	328721	328816	328817	Alban Morley	628	" Alban ! Lionel ! - welcome always ; but what brings you hither at such an hour , with such clamour ? Armed too ! "
328811	328814	328816	328817	Alban Morley	628	" Well , "
328824	328846	328911	328911	he	512	" well , I am surprised ! - yes , for the first time in twenty years , I and surprised ! "
328847	328909	328911	328911	he	512	" Surprised perhaps to find me at this hour still up , and with a person upon business - the door locked . However , mutual explanations later . Of course you stay here to night . My business with this - this visitor , is now over . Lionel , open that door - here is the key . - Sir "
328924	328930	328911	328911	he	512	" Rise and speak not , "
328933	328957	329059	329059	Darrell	512	" Sir , I need not detain you longer . Allow me to show you the way out of this rambling old house . "
329051	329057	329075	329075	he	512	" Stand back , there ! "
329070	329073	329075	329075	he	512	" Sir , "
329085	329158	329230	329230	He	512	" mark that I told you truly - you were in my power ; and if the events of this night can lead you to acknowledge a watchful Providence , and recall with a shudder the crime from which you have been saved , why , then , I too , out of gratitude to Heaven , may think of means by which to free others from the peril of your despair . "
329239	329294	329305	329305	he	628	" Forgive me ; not in the presence of a servant could I say , ' You have saved me from an unnatural strife , and my daughter 's husband from a murderer 's end . ' But by what wondrous mercy did you learn my danger ? Were you sent to my aid ? "
329299	329304	329305	329305	he	628	" You may judge , "
329310	329388	329397	329397	Darrell	512	" how great was our anxiety , when , following the instructions of our guide , while our driver rang his alarum at the front portals , we made our entrance into yon ribs of stone , found the doors already opened , and feared we might be too late . But , meanwhile , the poor woman waits without in the carriage that brought us from the station . I must go and relieve her mind . "
329389	329395	329514	329514	Darrell	512	" And bring her hither , "
329399	329512	329514	329514	Darrell	512	" to receive my gratitude . Stay , Alban ; while you leave me with her , you will speak aside to Mills ; tell him that you heard there was an attempt to be made on the house , and came to frustrate it , but that your fears were exaggerated ; the man was more a half - insane mendicant than a robber . Be sure , at least , that his identity with Losely be not surmised , and bid Mills treat the affair lightly . Public men are exposed , you know , to assaults from crackbrained enthusiasts ; or stay - I once was a lawyer , and "
329534	329563	329569	329569	Darrell	512	" there are men so out of their wits as to fancy a lawyer has ruined them ! Lionel , tell poor Dick Fairthorn to come to me . "
329574	329646	329774	329774	she	8629	" Go back to your room - open your casement - step out on to the parapet - you will see something white ; it is a scrap of paper wrapped round my old armorial seal . Bring it to me just as it is , Dick . That poor young Lionel , we must keep him here a day or two ; mind , no prickles for him , Dick . "
329766	329773	329774	329774	she	8629	" You owe me no thanks , "
329784	329795	329801	329801	Darrell	512	" I sought to save not you , but him . "
329796	329799	329801	329801	Darrell	512	" How ! "
329805	329819	329774	329774	she	8629	" you feel no resentment against the man who injured and betrayed you ? "
329820	330118	330146	330146	Darrell	512	" What my feelings may be towards him are not for you to conjecture ; man could not conjecture them ; I am woman . What they once were I might blush for ; what they are now , I could own without shame . But you , Mr. Darrell , - you , in the hour of my uttermost anguish , when all my future was laid desolate , and the world lay crushed at my feet - you - man , chivalrous man ! - you had for me no human compassion - you thrust me in scorn from your doors - you saw in my woe nothing but my error - you sent me forth , stripped of reputation , branded by your contempt , to famine or to suicide . And you wonder that I feel less resentment against him who wronged me than against you , who , knowing me wronged , only disdained my grief . The answer is plain - the scorn of the man she only reverenced leaves to a woman no memory to mitigate its bitterness and gall . The wrongs inflicted by the man she loved may leave , what they have left to me , an undying sense of a past existence - radiant , joyous , hopeful ; of a time when the earth seemed covered with blossoms , just ready to burst into bloom ; when the skies through their haze took the rose - hues as the sun seemed about to rise . The memory that I once was happy , at least then , I owe to him who injured and betrayed me . To you , when happiness was lost to me forever , what do I owe ? Tell me . "
330149	330198	330205	330205	she	9691	" Pardon me ; this is no moment to revive recollections of anger on my part ; but reflect , I entreat you , and you will feel that I was not too harsh . In the same position any other man would not have been less severe . "
330199	330204	330306	330306	She	9691	" Any other man ! "
330208	330305	330306	330306	She	9691	" ay , possibly ! but would the scorn of any other man so have crushed self - esteem ? The injuries of the wicked do not sour us against the good ; but the scoff of the good leaves us malignant against virtue itself . Any other man ! Tut ! Genius is bound to be indulgent . It should know human errors so well - has , with its large luminous forces , such errors itself when it deigns to be human , that , where others may scorn , genius should only pity . "
330316	330526	330546	330548	the grim woman	5365	" And pity was my due . Had you , or had any one lofty as yourself in reputed honour , but said to me , ' Thou hast sinned , thou must suffer ; but sin itself needs compassion , and compassion forbids thee to despair , ' why , then , I might have been gentler to the things of earth , and less steeled against the influences of Heaven than I have been . That is all no matter now . Mr. Darrell , I would not part from you with angry and bitter sentiments . Colonel Morley tells me that you have not only let the man , whom we need not name , go free , but that you have guarded the secret of his designs . For this I thank you . I thank you , because what is left of that blasted and deformed existence I have taken into mine . And I would save that man from his own devices as I would save my soul from its own temptations . Are you large - hearted enough to comprehend me ? Look in my face - you have seen his ; all earthly love is erased and blotted out of both . "
330539	330544	330546	330548	the grim woman	5365	" You , too , "
330559	330579	330580	330580	He	1039	" you , too , have loved , I am told , and you , too , were forsaken . "
330586	330675	330736	330736	she	14473	" What is left to your heart of its ancient folly ? I should like to know ! I am curious to learn if there be a man who can feel as woman ! Have you only resentment ? have you only disdain ? have you only vengeance ? have you pity ? or have you the jealous absorbing desire , surviving the affection from which it sprang , that still the life wrenched from you shall owe , despite itself , a melancholy allegiance to your own ? "
330739	330763	330769	330769	Darrell	512	" I see ! man 's inflexible pride - no pardon there ! But own , at least , that you have suffered . "
330764	330767	330736	330736	she	14473	" Suffered ! "
330780	330822	330736	330736	she	14473	" You have ! - and you own it ! Fellow - sufferer , I have no more anger against you . Neither should pity , but let each respect the other . A few words more , - this child ! "
330823	330870	330736	330736	she	14473	" Ay - ay - this child ! you will be truthful . You will not seek to deceive me - you know that she - she - claimed by that assassin , reared by his convict father - she is no daughter of my line ! "
330871	330896	330736	330736	she	14473	" What ! would it then be no joy to know that your line did not close with yourself - that your child might - "
330897	331019	331025	331025	Arabella	1039	" Cease , madam , cease - it matters not to a man nor to a race when it perish , so that it perish at last with honour . Who would have either himself or his lineage live on into a day when the escutcheon is blotted and the name disgraced ? No ; if that be Matilda 's child , tell me , and I will bear , as man may do , the last calamity which the will of Heaven may inflict . If , as I have all reason to think , the tale be an imposture , speak and give me the sole comfort to which I would cling amidst the ruin of all other hopes . "
331020	331023	331025	331025	Arabella	1039	" Verily , "
331041	331365	331037	331037	her	9696	" verily , has a man 's heart the same throb and fibre as a woman 's ? Had I a child like that blue - eyed wanderer with the frail form needing protection , and the brave spirit that ennobles softness , what would be my pride ! my bliss ! Talk of shame - disgrace ! Fie - fie - the more the evil of others darkened one so innocent , the more cause to love and shelter her . But - I - am childless ! Shall I tell you that the offence which lies heaviest on my conscience has been my cruelty to that girl ? She was given an infant to my care . I saw in her the daughter of that false , false , mean , deceiving friend , who had taken my confidence , and bought , with her supposed heritage , the man sworn by all oaths to me . I saw in her , too , your descendant , your rightful heiress . I rejoiced in a revenge on your daughter and yourself . Think not I would have foisted her on your notice ! No . I would have kept her without culture , without consciousness of a higher lot ; and when I gave her up to her grandsire , the convict , it was a triumph to think that Matilda 's child would be an outcast . Terrible thought ! but I was mad then . But that poor convict whom you , in your worldly arrogance , so loftily despise - he took to his breast what was flung away as a worthless weed . And if the flower keep the promise of the bud , never flower so fair bloomed from your vaunted stem ! And yet you would bless me if I said , ' Pass on , childless man ; she is nothing to you ! ' "
331366	331416	331025	331025	Arabella	1039	" Madam , let us not argue . As you yourself justly imply , man 's heart and woman 's must each know throbs that never are , and never should be , familiar to the other . I repeat my question , and again I implore your answer . "
331417	331474	331037	331037	her	9696	" I can not answer for certain ; and I am fearful of answering at all , lest on a point so important I should mislead you . Matilda 's child ? Jasper affirmed it to me . His father believed him - I believed him . I never had the shadow of a doubt till - "
331475	331485	331025	331025	Arabella	1039	" Till what ? For Heaven 's sake speak . "
331486	331507	331037	331037	her	9696	" Till about five years ago , or somewhat more , I saw a letter from Gabrielle Desmarets , and - "
331508	331529	331570	331570	She	9697	" Ah ! which made you suspect , as I do , that the child is Gabrielle Desmaret 's daughter . "
331541	331569	331615	331615	she	9697	" Gabrielle 's daughter ! You think so . Her child that I sheltered ! Her child for whom I have just pleaded to you ! Hers ! "
331619	331653	331615	331615	she	9697	" No ! say no more now . You may hear from me again should I learn what may decide at least this doubt one way or the other . Farewell , sir . "
331654	331677	331615	331615	she	9697	" Not yet . Permit me to remind you that you have saved the life of a man whose wealth is immense . "
331678	331704	331615	331615	she	9697	" Mr. Darrell , my wealth in relation to my wants is perhaps immense as yours , for I do not spend what I possess . "
331705	331794	331803	331803	Arabella	1039	" But this unhappy outlaw , whom you would save from himself , can henceforth be to you but a burthen and a charge . After what has passed to - night , I do tremble to think that penury may whisper other houses to rob , other lives to menace . Let me , then , place at your disposal , to be employed in such mode as you deem the best , a sum that may suffice to secure an object which we have in common . "
331795	331801	331803	331803	Arabella	1039	" No , Mr. Darrell , "
331807	331880	332091	332094	the old heathen oracle	9709	" whatever he be , never with my consent shall Jasper Losely be beholden to you for alms . If money can save him from shame and a dreadful death , that money shall be mine . I have said it . And , hark you , Mr. Darrell , what is repentance without atonement ? I say not that I repent ; but I do know that I seek to atone . "

332163	332168	332395	332395	He	1450	" FULL OF MATTER . "
332386	332394	332491	332491	Cutts	954	" Anything rather than this humiliating failure . "
332498	332511	333109	333109	she	2842	" I blabbed your secret , and sent the aid that foiled it "
333093	333107	333148	333148	she	2842	" Stranger ! luck 's in store for you . Tell your fortune ! "
333151	333156	333162	333162	Jasper	721	" Wish and cut . "
333157	333160	333148	333148	she	2842	" Yshaw , "
333201	333218	333228	333229	the man	1450	" Get away ; you turn my stomach . Your cards smell ; so do you ! "
333219	333226	333228	333229	the man	1450	" Forgive her , worthy sir , "
333234	333303	333309	333311	the irreverent Losely	721	" The hag may be unsavoury , but she is wise . The Three Sisters who accosted the Scottish Thane , sir Macbeth - you have seen it on the stage ? were not savoury . Withered , and wild in their attire , sir , but they knew a thing or two ! She sees luck in your face . Cross her hand and give it vent ! "
333304	333307	333326	333326	he	1450	" Fiddledee , "
333313	333324	333521	333522	that man	11249	" Take her off , or I shall scald her , "
333540	333589	333595	333595	Losely	721	" While the time , sir ? What say you ? A game or two ? I can stake my pistoles - that is , sir , so far as a fourpenny bit goes . If ignorant of this French game , sir , cribbage or all fours ? "
333590	333593	333613	333613	he	1450	" No , "
333599	333611	333613	333613	he	1450	" there is nothing to be got out of you ; otherwise "
333618	333662	333521	333522	that man	11249	" But I have seen you under other circumstances . What has become of your Theatrical Exhibition ? Gambled it away ? Yet , from what I see of your play , I think you ought not to have lost , Mr. Rugge . "
333669	333718	333663	333666	The ex - manager	9762	" What ! You knew me before the Storm ? - before the lightning struck me , as I may say , sir - and falling into difficulties , I became - a wreck ? You knew me ? - not of the Company ? - a spectator ? "
333719	333749	333521	333522	that man	11249	" As you say - a spectator . You had once in your employ an actor - clever old fellow . Waife , I think , he was called . "
333750	333778	333796	333796	Losely	721	" Ah ! hold ! At that name , sir , my wounds bleed afresh . From that execrable name , sir , there hangs a tale ! "
333779	333794	333521	333522	that man	11249	" Indeed ! Then it will be a relief to you to tell it , "
333815	333901	333521	333522	that man	11249	" Sir , when a gentleman , who is a gentleman , asks as a favour a specimen of my powers of recital , not professionally , and has before him the sparkling goblet , which he does not invite me to share , he insults my fallen fortunes . Sir , I am poor - I own it ; I have fallen into the sere and yellow leaf , sir ; but I have still in this withered bosom the heart of a Briton ! "
333902	333920	333521	333522	that man	11249	" Warm it , Mr. Rugge . Help yourself to the brandy - and the lady too . "
333921	333963	333987	333987	Losely	721	" Sir , you are a gentleman ; sir , your health . Hag , drink better days to us both . That woman , sir , is a hag , but she is an honour to her sex - faithful ! "
333964	333985	334088	334092	the rough - clad stranger	9765	" It is astonishing how faithful ladies are when not what is called beautiful . I speak from painful experience , "
334039	334063	334228	334228	he	9762	" But , now , Mr. Rugge , I am all ears ; perhaps you will be kind enough to be all tale . "
334223	334226	334228	334228	he	9762	" Sir , "
334230	334660	334212	334212	he	9762	" I was ambitious . From my childhood 's hour I dreamed of the great York Theatre - dreamed of it literally thrice . Fatal Vision ! But like other dreams , that dream would have faded - been forgotten in the workday world - and I should not have fallen into the sere and yellow , but have had , as formerly , troops of friends , and not been reduced to the horrors of poverty and a faithful Hag . But , sir , when I first took to my bosom that fiend William Waife , he exhibited a genius , sir , that Dowton you have seen Dowton ? - grand was a stick as compared with . Then my ambition , sir , blazed and flared up - obstreperous , and my childhood 's dream haunted me ; and I went about musing Hag , you recollect ! - and muttering ' The Royal Theatre at York . ' But , incredible though it seem , the ungrateful scorpion left me with a treacherous design to exhibit the parts I had fostered on the London boards ; and even - handed Justice , sir , returned the poisoned chalice to his lips , causing him to lose an eye and to hobble - besides splitting up his voice - which served him right . And again I took the scorpion for the sake of the Phenomenon . I had a babe myself once , sir , though you may not think it . Gormerick that is this faithful Hag gave the babe Daffy 's Elixir , in teething ; but it died - convulsions . I comforted myself when that Phenomenon came out on my stage - in pink satin and pearls . ' Ha , ' I said , ' the great York Theatre shall yet be mine ! ' The haunting idea became a Mania , sir . The learned say that there is a Mania called Money Mania - Monomania ? ? - when one can think but of the one thing needful - as the guilty Thane saw the dagger , sir - you understand . And when the Phenomenon had vanished and gone , as I was told , to America , where I now wish I was myself , acting Rolla at New York or elsewhere , to a free and enlightened people - then , sir , the Mania grew on me still stronger and stronger . There was a pride in it , sir , a British pride .
334661	334718	334724	334724	Losely	721	" I said to this faithful Hag : ' What - shall I not have the York because that false child has deserted me ? Am I not able to realise a Briton 's ambition without being beholden to a Phenomenon in spangles ? ' Sir , I took the York ! Alone I did it ! "
334719	334722	334724	334724	Losely	721	" And , "
334752	334762	334770	334770	Rugge	438	" And the York Theatre alone perhaps did you . "
334763	334768	334770	334770	Rugge	438	" Right , sir , "
334780	335267	335277	335277	Jasper	721	" It was a Grand Concern , and might have done for the Bank of England ! It swallowed up my capital with as much ease , sir , as I could swallow an oyster if there were one upon that plate ! I saw how it would be , the very first week - when I came out myself , strong - Kean 's own part in the Iron Chest - Mortimer , sir ; there warn't three pounds ten in the house - packed audience , sir , and they had the face to hiss me . ' Hag , ' said I to Mrs. Gormerick , ' this Theatre is a howling wilderness . ' But there is a fascination in a Grand Concern , of which one is the head - one goes on and on . All the savings of a life devoted to the British Drama and the production of native genius went in what I may call - a jiffey ! But it was no common object , sir , to your sight displayed - but what with pleasure , sir I appeal to the Hag , Heaven itself surveyed ! - a great man struggling , sir , with the storms of fate , and greatly falling , sir , with - a sensation ! York remembers it to this day ! I took the benefit of the Act - it was the only benefit I did take - and nobody was the better for it . But I do n't repine - I realised my dream : that is more than all can say . Since then I have had many downs , and no ups . I have been a messenger , sir - a prompter , sir , in my own Exhibition , to which my own clown , having married into the tragic line , succeeded , sir , as proprietor ; buying of me when I took the York , the theatre , scenery , and properties , sir , with the right still to call himself ' Rugge 's Grand Theatrical Exhibition , ' for an old song , sir - Melancholy . Tyrannised over , sir - snubbed and bullied by a creature dressed in a little brief authority ; and my own tights - scarlet - as worn by me in my own applauded part of ' The Remorseless Baron . ' At last , with this one faithful creature , I resolved to burst the chains - to be free as air - in short , a chartered libertine , sir . We have not much , but thank the immortal gods , we are independent , sir - the Hag and I - chartered libertines ! And we are alive still - at which , in strict confidence , I may own to you that I am astonished . "
335268	335275	335277	335277	Jasper	721	" Yes ! you do live , "
335300	335311	334770	334770	Rugge	438	" you do live - it is amazing ! How ? "
335312	335382	335462	335462	Losely	721	" The Faithful tells fortunes ; and sometimes we pick up windfalls - widows and elderly single ladies - but it is dangerous . Labour is sweet , sir : but not hard labour in the dungeons of a Bridewell . She has known that labour , sir ; and in those intervals I missed her much , Do n't cry , Hag ; I repeat , I live ! "
335383	335460	334770	334770	Rugge	438	" I understand now ; you live upon her ! They are the best of creatures , these hags , as you call them , certainly . Well , well , no saying what a man may come to ! I suppose you have never seen Waife , nor that fellow you say was so well - dressed and good - looking , and who sold you the Phenomenon , nor the Phenomenon herself - Eh ? "
335478	335513	334770	334770	Rugge	438	" I have seen Waife - the one - eyed monster ! Aha ! - I have seen him ! - and yesterday too ; and a great comfort it was to me too ! "
335514	335522	334770	334770	Rugge	438	" You saw Waife yesterday - where ? "
335523	335536	335546	335546	Losely	721	" At Ouzelford , which I and the Faithful left this morning . "
335537	335544	335546	335546	Losely	721	" And what was he doing ? "
335554	335563	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" Begging , breaking stones , or what ? "
335564	335567	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" No , "
335573	335675	335684	335685	the Hag	777	" I ca n't say it was what , in farcical composition , I should call such nuts to me as that , sir . Still , he was in a low way - seemed a pedlar or a hawker , selling out of a pannier on the Rialto - I mean the Cornmarket , sir - not even a hag by his side , only a great dog - French . A British dog would have scorned such fellowship . And he did not look merry as he used to do when in my troop . Did he , Hag ? "
335676	335682	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" His conscience smites him , "
335689	335696	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" Did you speak to him ? "
335697	335820	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" Why , no . I should have liked it , but we could not at that moment , seeing that we were not in our usual state of independence . This faithful creature was being led before the magistrates , and I too - charge of cheating a cook - maid , to whom the Hag had only said , ' that if the cards spoke true , she would ride in her carriage . ' The charge broke down ; but we were placed for the night in the Cells of the Inquisition , remanded , and this morning banished from the city , and are now on our way to - any other city ; - eh , Hag ? "
335821	335840	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" And the old man was not with the Phenomenon ? What has become of her , then ? "
335841	335929	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" Perhaps she may be with him at his house , if he has one ; only , she was not with him on the Rialto or Cornmarket . She was with him two years ago , I know ; and he and she were better off then than he is now , I suspect . And that is why it did me good , sir , to see him a pedlar - a common pedlar - fallen into the sere , like the man he abandoned ! "
335930	335940	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" Humph - where were they two years ago ? "
335941	335982	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" At a village not far from Humberston . He had a pretty house , sir , and sold baskets ; and the girl was there too , favoured by a great lady - a Marchioness , sir ! Gods ! "
335983	335998	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" Marchioness ? - near Humberston ? The Marchioness of Montfort , I suppose ? "
335999	336196	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" Likely enough ; I do n't remember . All I know is , that two years ago my old Clown was my tyrannical manager ; and being in that capacity , and this world being made for Caesar , which is a shame , sir , he said to me , with a sneer , ' Old Gentleman Waife , whom you used to bully , and his Juliet Araminta , are in clover ! ' And the mocking varlet went on to unfold a tale to the effect , that when he had last visited Humberston , in the race - week , a young tradesman , who was courting the Columbine , whose young idea I myself taught to shoot on the light fantastic toe , treated that Columbine , and one of her sister train being , indeed , her aunt , who has since come out at the Surrey in Desdemona to a picnic in a fine park . That 's discipline ! - ha , ha ! And there , sir , Columbine and her aunt saw Waife on the other side of a stream by which they sate carousing . "
336197	336207	335569	335569	Rugge	438	" The Clown perhaps said it to spite you . "
336208	336427	336434	336435	the Hag	4640	" Columbine herself confirmed his tale , and said that on returning to the Village Inn for the Triumphal Car or bus which brought them , she asked if a Mr. Waife dwelt thereabouts , and was told , ' Yes , with his grand - daughter . ' And she went on asking , till all came out as the Clown reported . And Columbine had not even the gratitude , the justice , to expose that villain - not even to say he had been my perfidious servant ! She had the face to tell me ' she thought it might harm him , and he was a kind old soul . ' Sir , a Columbine whose toes I had rapped scores of times before they could be turned out , was below contempt ! but when my own Clown thus triumphed over me , in parading before my vision the bloated prosperity of mine enemy , it went to my heart like a knife ; and we had words on it , sir , and - I left him to his fate . But a pedlar ! Gentleman Waife has come to that ! The heavens are just , sir , and of our pleasant vices , sir , make instruments that - that - "
336428	336432	336444	336447	the maid - servant	9771	" Scourge us , "
336450	336486	336494	336495	the Hag	4640	" My horse and bill . Well , Mr. Rugge , I must quit your agreeable society . I am not overflowing with wealth at this moment , or I would request your acceptance of - "
336487	336492	336509	336509	his	9773	" The smallest trifle , "
336521	336528	336907	336910	no one Great House	9791	" alieni appetens , sui profusus , "
336927	336934	337414	337415	the gentleman	11276	" the legitimate influence of property , "
337400	337412	337414	337415	the gentleman	11276	" She takes much after her mother , does Anna Maria , "
337417	337429	337474	337474	Each	3906	" and I am very glad she is so well married . "
337481	337489	337474	337474	Each	3906	" What ! - Mr. George Morley ! "
337490	337512	337474	337474	Each	3906	" Mr. Hartopp ! - How are you , my dear sir ? - What brings you so far from home ? "
337513	337652	337474	337474	Each	3906	" I am on a visit to my daughter , Anna Maria . She has not been long married - to young Jessop . Old Jessop is one of the principal merchants at Ouzelford - very respectable worthy family . The young couple are happily settled in a remarkably snug villa - that is it with the portico , not a hundred yards behind us , to the right . Very handsome town , Ouzelford ; you are bound to it , of course ? - we can walk together . I am going to look at the papers in the City Rooms - very fine rooms they are . But you are straight from London , perhaps , and have seen the day 's journals ? Any report of the meeting in aid of the Ragged Schools ? "
337653	337674	337474	337474	Each	3906	" Not that I know of . I have not come from London this morning , nor seen the papers . "
337675	337696	337474	337474	Each	3906	" Oh ! - there 's a strange - looking fellow following us ; but perhaps he is your servant ? "
337697	337740	337474	337474	Each	3906	" Not so , but my travelling companion - indeed my guide . In fact , I come to Ouzelford in the faint hope of discovering there a poor old friend of mine , of whom I have long been in search . "
337741	337839	337845	337845	George	855	" Perhaps the Jessops can help you ; they know everybody at Ouzelford . But now I meet you thus by surprise , Mr. George , I should very much like to ask your advice on a matter which has been much on my mind the last twenty - four hours , and which concerns a person I contrived to discover at Ouzelford , though I certainly was not in search of him - a person about whom you and I had a conversation a few years ago , when you were staying with your worthy father . "
337840	337843	337845	337845	George	855	" Eh ? "
337849	337856	337474	337474	Each	3906	" whom do you speak of ? "
337857	337902	337845	337845	George	855	" That singular vagabond who took me in , you remember - called himself Chapman - real name William Losely , a returned convict . You would have it that he was innocent , though the man himself had pleaded guilty on his trial . "
337903	338052	338131	338131	myself	0	" His whole character belied his lips then . Oh , Mr. Hartopp , that man commit the crime imputed to him ! - a planned , deliberate robbery - an ungrateful , infamous breach of trust ! That man - that ! he who rejects the money he does not earn , even when pressed on him by anxious imploring friends - he who has now gone voluntarily forth , aged and lonely , to wring his bread from the humblest calling rather than incur the risk of injuring the child with whose existence he had charged himself ! - the dark midnight thief ! Believe him not , though his voice may say it . To screen , perhaps , some other man , he is telling you a noble lie . But what of him ? Have you really seen him , and at Ouzelford ? "
338053	338056	337845	337845	George	855	" Yes . "
338057	338060	338131	338131	myself	0	" When ? "
338061	338122	338674	338674	I	0	" Yesterday . I was in the City Reading - Room , looking out of the window . I saw a great white dog in the street below ; I knew the dog at once , sir , though he is disguised by restoration to his natural coat , and his hair is as long as a Peruvian lama 's . "
338699	338699	338674	338674	I	0	"
338700	338779	338674	338674	I	0	" My dear Mr. Hartopp , do not vex yourself with this very honourable dilemma of conscience . Let me only find my poor old friend , my benefactor I may call him , and I hope to persuade him , if not to return to the home that waits him , at least to be my guest , or put himself under my care . Do you know the name of the widow with whom he lodges ? "
338780	338997	338998	338999	George Morley	855	" Yes - Halse ; and I know the town well enough to conduct you , if not to the house itself , still to its immediate neighbourhood . Pray allow me to accompany you ; I should like it very much - for , though you may not think it , from the light way I have been talking of Chapman , I never was so interested in any man , never so charmed by any man ; and it has often haunted me at night , thinking that I behaved too harshly to him , and that he was about on the wide world , an outcast , deprived of his little girl , whom he had trusted to me . And I should have run after him yesterday , or called on him this morning , and said , ' Let me serve you , ' if it had not been for the severity with which he and his son were spoken of , and I myself rebuked for mentioning their very names , by a man whose opinion I , and indeed all the country , must hold in the highest respect - a man of the finest honour , the weightiest character - I mean Guy Darrell , the great Darrell . "
339002	339057	338674	338674	I	0	" I believe Darrell knows nothing of the elder Losely , and is prejudiced against him by the misdeeds of the younger , to whose care you and I can not blame you , for I also was instrumental to the same transfer which might have proved calamitously fatal surrendered the poor motherless girl . "
339058	339080	338998	338999	George Morley	855	" She is not with her grandfather now ' ! She lives still , I hope ! She was very delicate . "
339081	339094	339163	339165	the mild Hartopp	682	" She lives - she is safe . Ha - take care ! "
339150	339161	339170	339170	he	682	" An impudent , careless , ruffianly fellow , indeed ! "
339186	339192	339307	339307	Merle	420	" He must be drunk ! "
339327	339334	339399	339400	a woman	13633	" Widow Halse , Prospect Row , "
339425	339427	339489	339489	Merle	420	" charing "
339480	339482	339894	339895	the clergyman	6245	" fetch "
339900	339923	339989	339989	Waife	433	" Is there not something about a man 's home which attests his character ? - No ' pleading guilty ' here . "
339983	339987	339989	339989	Waife	433	" Thank Heaven , "
339996	340087	340101	340101	Jasper	721	" out of sight , out of hearing now ! Now you may speak ; now I can listen ! O wretched son of my lost angel , whom I so vainly sought to save by the sacrifice of all my claims to the respect of men , for what purpose do you seek me ? I have nothing left that you can take away ! Is it the child again ? See - see - look round - search the house if you will - she is not here . "
340088	340099	340101	340101	Jasper	721	" Bear with me , if you can , sir , "
340110	340174	339989	339989	Waife	433	" you , at least , can say nothing that I will not bear . But I am in my right when I ask you to tell me , without equivocation or reserve , if Sophy , though not actually within these walls , be near you , in this town or its neighbourhood ? - in short , still under your protection ? "
340175	340193	340101	340101	Jasper	721	" Not in this town - not near it - not under my protection ; I swear . "
340194	340242	339989	339989	Waife	433	" Do not swear , father ; I have no belief in other men 's oaths . I believe your simple word . Now comes my second question - remember I am still strictly in my right - where is she ? - and under whose care ? "
340243	340511	340519	340519	Jasper	721	" I will not say . One reason why I have abandoned the very air she breathes was , that you might not trace her in tracing me . But she is out of your power again to kidnap and to sell . You might molest , harass , shame her , by proclaiming yourself her father ; but regain her into your keeping , cast her to infamy and vice - never , never ! She is now with no powerless , miserable convict , for whom Law has no respect . She is now no helpless infant without a choice , without a will . She is safe from all , save the wanton , unprofitable effort to disgrace her . O Jasper , Jasper , be human - she is so delicate of frame - she is so sensitive to reproach , so tremulously alive to honour - I am not fit to be near her now . I have been a tricksome , shifty vagrant , and , innocent though I be , the felon 's brand is on me ! But you , you too , who never loved her , who can not miss her , whose heart is not breaking at her loss as mine is now - you , you - to rise up from the reeking pesthouse in which you have dwelt by choice , and say , ' Descend from God 's day with me ' - Jasper , Jasper , you will not - you can not ; it would be the malignity of a devil ! "
340512	340517	340519	340519	Jasper	721	" Father , hold ! "
340525	340693	340699	340701	the old man	1741	" I owe to you more than I do to that thing of pink and white . I know better than you the trumpery of all those waxen dolls of whom dupes make idols . At each turn of the street you may find them in basketfuls - blue - eyed or black - eyed , just the same worthless frippery or senseless toys ; but every man dandling his own doll , whether he call it sweetheart or daughter , makes the same puling boast that he has an angel of purity in his puppet of wax . Nay , hear me ! to that girl I owe nothing . You know what I owe to you . You bid me not seek her , and say , ' I am your father . ' Do you think it does not misbecome me more , and can it wound you less , when I come to you , and remind you that I am your son ! "
340694	340697	340741	340741	Jasper	721	" Jasper ! "
340736	340739	340741	340741	Jasper	721	" And , "
340743	340886	340699	340701	the old man	1741	" remembering how you once loved me - with what self - sacrifice you proved that love - it is with a bitter grudge against that girl that I see her thus take that place in your affection which was mine , - and you so indignant against me if I even presume to approach her . What ! I have the malignity of a devil because I would not quietly lie down in yonder kennels to starve , or sink into the grade of those whom your daintier thief disclaims ; spies into unguarded areas , or cowardly skulkers by blind walls ; while in the paltry girl , who you say is so well provided for , I see the last and sole resource which may prevent you from being still more degraded , still more afflicted by your son . "
340887	340930	340939	340939	Jasper	721	" What is it you want ? Even if Sophy were in your power , Darrell would not be more disposed to enrich or relieve you . He will never believe your tale , nor deign even to look into its proofs . "
340931	340937	340939	340939	Jasper	721	" He might at last , "
340943	340994	341242	341244	the old man	1741	" Surely with all that wealth , no nearer heir than a remote kinsman in the son of a beggared spendthrift by a linendraper 's daughter - he should need a grandchild more than you do ; yet the proofs you speak of convinced yourself ; you believe my tale . "
340995	341240	341295	341295	he	1741	" Believe - yes , for that belief was everything in the world , to me ! Ah , remember how joyously , when my term of sentence expired , I hastened to seek you at Paris , deceived by the rare letters with which you had deigned to cheer me - fondly dreaming that , in expiating your crime , I should have my reward in your redemption - should live to see you honoured , honest , good - live to think your mother watched us from heaven with a smile on both - and that we should both join her at last - you purified by my atonement ! Oh , and when I saw you so sunken , so hardened , exulting in vice as in a glory - bravo and partner in a gambler 's hell - or , worse still , living on the plunder of miserable women , even the almsman of that vile Desmarets - my son , my son , my lost Lizzy 's son blotted out of my world for ever ! - then , then I should have died if you had not said , boasting of the lie which had wrung the gold from Darrell , ' But the child lives still . ' Believe you - oh , yes , yes - for in that belief something was still left to me to cherish , to love , to live for ! "
341289	341294	341295	341295	he	1741	" Sir , sir , "
341303	341623	341629	341629	Wife	429	" do not let me see you weep . You can not believe me , but I say solemnly that , if there be in me a single remnant of affection for any human being , it is for you . When I consented to leave you to bear the sentence which should have fallen on myself , sure I am that I was less basely selfish than absurdly vain . I fancied myself so born to good fortune ! - so formed to captivate some rich girl ! - and that you would return to share wealth with me ; that the evening of your days would be happy ; that you would be repaid by my splendour for your own disgrace ! And when I did marry , and did ultimately get from the father - in - law who spurned me the capital of his daughter 's fortune , pitifully small though it was compared to my expectations , my first idea was to send half of that sum to you . But - but - I was living with those who thought nothing so silly as a good intention - nothing so bad as a good action . That mocking she - devil , Gabrielle , too ! Then the witch 's spell of that d - - d green - table ! Luck against one - wait ! double the capital ere you send the half . Luck with one - how balk the tide ? how fritter the capital just at the turn of doubling ? Soon it grew irksome even to think of you ; yet still when I did , I said , ' Life is long , I shall win riches ; he shall share them some day or other ! ' - Basta , basta ! - what idle twaddle or hollow brag all this must seem to you ! "
341624	341627	341634	341634	his	9928	" No , "
341656	341789	341634	341634	his	9928	" So , as you say , you found me at Paris . I told you where I had placed the child , not conceiving that Arabella would part with her , or you desire to hamper yourself with an encumbrance - nay , I took for granted that you would find a home as before with some old friend or country cousin : - but fancying that your occasional visits to her might comfort you , since it seemed to please you so much when I said she lived . Thus we parted , - you , it seems , only anxious to save that child from ever falling into my hands , or those of Gabrielle Desmarets ; I hastening to forget all but the riotous life around me till - "
341790	341852	341634	341634	his	9928	" Till you came back to England to rob from me the smile of the only face that I knew would never wear contempt , and to tell the good man with whom I thought she had so safe a shelter that I was a convicted robber , by whose very love her infancy was sullied . O Jasper ! Jasper ! "
341853	341979	341992	341992	Waife	442	" I never said that - never thought of saying it . Arabella Crane did so , with the reckless woman - will to gain her object . But I did take the child from you . Why ? Partly because I needed money so much that I would have sold a hecatomb of children for half what I was offered to bind the girl to a service that could not be very dreadful , since yourself had first placed here there ; - and partly because you had shrunk , it seems , from appealing to old friends : you were living , like myself , from hand to mouth ; what could that child be to you but a drag and a bother ? "
341980	341990	342012	342012	his	9929	" And you will tell me , I suppose , "
342019	342107	342192	342192	he	9930	" you will tell me that it was from the same considerate tenderness that you would have again filched her from me some months later , to place her with that ' she - devil ' who was once more by your side ; to be reared and sold to - O horror ! - horror ! - unimaginable horror ! - that pure helpless infant ! - you , armed with the name of father ! - you , strong in that mighty form of man ! "
342108	342153	342192	342192	he	9930	" What do you mean ? Oh , I remember now ! When Gabrielle was in London , and I had seen you on the bridge ? Who could have told you that I meant to get the child from you at that time ? "
342204	342587	342595	342595	Waife	442	" But whoever told you that I harboured the design that it whitens your lip to hint at , lied , and foully . Harkye , sir , many years ago Gabrielle had made acquaintance with Darrell , under another name , as Matilda 's friend long story now - not worth telling ; he had never , I believe , discovered the imposture . Just at the time you refer to , I heard that Darrell had been to France , inquiring himself into facts connected with my former story , that Matilda 's child was dead . That very inquiry seemed to show that he had not been so incredulous of my assertions of Sophy 's claims on him as he had affected to be when I urged them . He then went on into Italy . Talking this over with Gabrielle , she suggested that , if the child could be got into her possession , she would go with her in search of Darrell , resuming the name in which she had before known him - resuming the title and privilege of Matilda 's friend . In that character he might listen to her , when he would not to me . She might confirm my statement - melt his heart - coax him into terms . She was the cleverest creature ! I should have sold Sophy , it is true . For what ? A provision to place me above want and crime . Sold her to whom ? To the man who would see in her his daughter 's child , rear her to inherit his wealth - guard her as his own honour . What ! was this the design that so shocks you ? Basta , Basta ! Again , I say , Enough . I never thought I should be so soft as to mutter excuses for what I have done . And if I do so now , the words seem forced from me against my will - forced from me , as if in seeing you I was again but a wild , lawless , wilful boy , who grieved to see you saddened by his faults , though he forgot his grief the moment you were out of sight . "
342588	342593	342600	342600	his	9932	" Oh , Jasper , "
342625	343003	342600	342600	his	9932	" You repent ! - you repent ! Yes ; call back your BOYHOOD - call it back ! Let it stand before you , now , visible , palpable ! Lo ! I see it ! Do not you ? Fearless , joyous Image ! Wild , lawless , wilful , as you say . Wild from exuberant life ; lawless as a bird is free , because air is boundless to untried exulting wings ; wilful from the ease with which the bravery and beauty of Nature 's radiant Darling forced way for each jocund whim through our yielding hearts ! Silence ! It is there ! I see it , as I saw it rise in the empty air when guilt and ignominy first darkened round you ; and my heart cried aloud , ' Not on him , not on him , not on that glorious shape of hope and promise - on me , whose life , useless hitherto , has lost all promise now - on me let fall the shame . ' And my lips obeyed my heart , and I said - ' Let the Laws ' will be done - I am the guilty man . ' Cruel , cruel one ! Was that sunny Boyhood then so long departed from you ? On the verge of youth , and such maturity in craft and fraud - that when you stole into my room that dark winter eve , threw yourself at my feet , spoke but of thoughtless debts , and the fear that you should be thrust from an industrious honest calling , and I - I said , ' No , no ; fear not ; the head of your firm likes you ; he has written to me ; I am trying already to raise the money you need ; it shall be raised , no matter what it cost me ; you shall be saved ; my Lizzie 's son shall never know the soil of a prison ; shun temptation henceforth : be but honest , and I shall be repaid ! ' - what , even then , you were coldly meditating the crime that will make my very grave dishonoured ! "
343004	343552	342600	342600	his	9932	" Meditating - not so ! How could I be ? Not till after what had thus passed between us , when you spoke with such indulgent kindness , did I even know that I might more than save myself - by monies - not raised at risk and loss to you ! Remember , you had left me in the inner room , while you went forth to speak with Gunston . There I overheard him talk of notes he had never counted , and might never miss ; describe the very place where they were kept ; and then the idea came to me irresistibly , ' better rob him than despoil my own generous father . ' Sir , I am not pretending to be better than I was . I was not quite the novice you supposed . Coveting pleasures or shows not within my reach , I had shrunk from draining you to supply the means ; I had not had the same forbearance for the superfluous wealth of others . I had learned with what simple tools old locks may fly open ; and none had ever suspected me , so I had no fear of danger , small need of premeditation : a nail on your mantelpiece , the cloven end of the hammer lying beside , to crook it when hot from the fire that blazed before me ! I say this to show you that I did not come provided ; nothing was planned beforehand ; all was the project and work of the moment . Such was my haste , I burnt myself to the bone with the red iron - feeling no pain , or rather , at that age , bearing all pain without wincing . Before Gunston left you , my whole plan was then arranged - my sole instrument fashioned . You groan . But how could I fancy that there would be detection ? How imagine that even if monies , never counted , were missed , suspicion could fall on you - better gentleman than he whom you served ? And had it not been for that accursed cloak which you so fondly wrapped round me when I set off to catch the night train back to - ; if it had not been , I say , for that cloak , there could have been no evidence to criminate either you or me - except that unlucky L5 note , which I pressed on you when we met at - - , where I was to hide till you had settled with my duns . And why did I press it on you ? - because you had asked me if I had wherewithal about me on which to live meanwhile ; and I , to save you from emptying your own purse , said , ' Yes ' ; showed you some gold , and pressed on you the bank - note , which I said I could not want - to go , in small part , towards my debts ; it was a childish , inconsistent wish to please you : and you seemed so pleased to take it as a proof that I cared for you . "
343553	343598	343604	343604	Jasper	721	" For me ! - no , no ; for honour - for honour - for honour ! I thought you cared for honour ; and the proof of that care was , thrusting into these credulous hands the share of your midnight plunder ! "
343599	343602	343763	343763	Jasper	721	" Sir , "
343656	343762	344152	344154	the old man	1741	" Sir , I declare that I never conceived that I was exposing you to danger ; nay , I meant , out of the money I had taken , to replace to you what you were about to raise , as soon as I could invent some plausible story of having earned it honestly . Stupid notions and clumsy schemes , as I now look back on them ; but , as you say , I had not long left boyhood , and , fancying myself deep and knowing , was raw in the craft I had practised . Basta , basta , basta ! "
343815	344150	344488	344488	Jasper	721	" What is done can not be undone . Fling it aside , sir - look to the future ; you with your pedlar 's pack , I with my empty pockets ! What can save you from the workhouse - me from the hulks or gibbet ? I know not , unless the persons sheltering that girl will buy me off by some provision which may be shared between us . Tell me , then , where she is ; leave me to deal in the business as I best may . Pooh ! why so scared ? I will neither terrify nor kidnap her . I will shuffle off the crust of blackguard that has hardened round me . I will be sleek and smooth , as if I were still the exquisite Lothario - copied by would - be rufflers , and spoiled by willing beauties . Oh , I can still play the gentleman , at least for an hour or two , if it be worth my while . Come , sir , come ; trust me ; out with the secret of this hidden maiden , whose interests should surely weigh not more with you than those of a starving son . What , you will not ? Be it so . I suspect that I know where to look for her - on what noble thresholds to set my daring foot ; what fair lady , mindful of former days - of girlish friendship - of virgin love - wraps in compassionate luxury Guy Darrell 's rejected heiress ? Ah , your looks tell me that I am hot on the scent . That fair lady I knew of old ; she is rich - I helped to make her so . She owes me something . I will call and remind her of it . And - tut , sir , tut - you shall not go to the workhouse , nor I to the hulks . "
344209	344406	344488	344488	Jasper	721	" Hark to me , unhappy reprobate , and heed me well ! To save that child from the breath of disgrace - to place her in what you yourself assured me where her rights amidst those in whose dwellings I lost the privilege to dwell when I took to myself your awful burthen - I thought to resign her charge for ever in this world . Think not that I will fly her now , when you invade . No - since my prayers will not move you - since my sacrifice to you has been so fruitless - since my absence from herself does not attain its end there , where you find her , shall you again meet me ! And if there we meet , and you come with the intent to destroy her peace and blast her fortune , then I , William Losely , am no more the felon . In the face of day I will proclaim the truth , and say , ' Robber , change place in earth 's scorn with me ; stand in the dock , where thy father stood in vain to save thee ! "
344408	344423	344488	344488	Jasper	721	" Bah , sir - too late now ; who would listen to you ? "
344424	344479	344488	344488	Jasper	721	" All who have once known me - all will listen . Friends of power and station will take up my cause . There will be fresh inquiry into facts that I held back - evidence that , in pleading guilty , I suppressed - ungrateful one - to ward away suspicion from you . "
344480	344486	344488	344488	Jasper	721	" Say what you will , "
344507	344572	344488	344488	Jasper	721	" I am no hypocrite in fair repute whom such threats would frighten . If you choose to thwart me in what I always held my last resource for meat and drink , I must stand in the dock even , perhaps , on a heavier charge than one so stale . Each for himself ; do your worst - what does it matter ? "
344573	344678	344838	344838	His	9937	" What does it matter that a father should accuse his son ! No , no - son , son , son - this must not be ; - let it not be ! - let me complete my martyrdom ! I ask no reversal of man 's decree , except before the Divine Tribunal . Jasper , Jasper - child of my love , spare the sole thing left to fill up the chasms in the heart that you laid waste . Speak not of starving , or of fresh crime . Stay - share this refuge ! I WILL WORK FOR BOTH ! "
344801	344837	345011	345011	He	9943	" Share your refuge ! no - no - I should break your heart downright did you see me daily - hourly as I am ! You work for both ! - you - you ! "
344853	345010	345268	345268	Hartopp	682	" As for that girl - you - you - you are - but no matter , I will try to obey you - will try to wrestle against hunger , despair , and thoughts that whisper sinking men with devils ' tongues . I will try - I will try ; if I succeed not , keep your threat - accuse me - give me up to justice - clear yourself ; but if you would crush me more than by the heaviest curse , never again speak to me with such dreadful tenderness ! Cling not to me , old man ; release me , I say ; - there - there ; off . Ah ! I did not hurt you ? Brute that I am - you bless me - you - you ! And I dare not bless again ! Let me go - let me go - let me go ! "
345274	345305	345234	345237	the decorous English Trader	9957	" Forgive me ; you said I should repent , if I knew all ! I do repent ! I do ! Forgive me - I shall never forgive myself . "
345306	345351	345268	345268	Hartopp	682	" Have I been dreaming ? What is all this ? You here , too , Mr. George ! But - but there was ANOTHER . Gone ! ah - gone - gone ! lost , lost ! Ha ! Did you overhear us ? "
345352	345386	345234	345237	the decorous English Trader	9957	" We overheard you - at that window ! See , spite of yourself , Heaven lets your innocence be known , and , in that innocence , your sublime self - sacrifice . "
345387	345412	345546	345546	Waife	433	" Hush ! you will never betray me , either of you - never . A father turn against his son ! - horrible ! "
345562	345593	345603	345603	Waife	433	" No , that would scare me to death . No doctors - no eavesdroppers . Leave me to myself - quiet and darkness ; I shall be well tomorrow . "
345610	345705	345711	345711	Hartopp	682	" You will not let out what you heard , I know ; you understand how little I can now care for men 's judgments ; but how dreadful it would be to undo all I have done - I to be witness against my Lizzy 's child ! I - I ! I trust you - dear , dear Mr. Morley ; make Mr. Hartopp sensible that , if he would not drive me mad , not a syllable of what he heard must go forth - ' twould be base in him . "
345706	345709	345711	345711	Hartopp	682	" Nay ! "
345719	345756	346040	346040	he	1741	" do n't fear me ; I will hold my peace , though ' tis very hard not to tell Williams at least that you did not take me in . But you shall be obeyed . "
346034	346039	346040	346040	he	1741	" He had dreamed , "
346043	346060	346251	346251	he	1741	" that he had heard her voice calling out to him to come to her help . "
346262	346300	346328	346329	the scholar	3036	" A very honest , kind - hearted man , sir ; can you deliver him from the Planets ? - they bring him into sad trouble . Is there no opening for a cobbler at Humberston ? "
346321	346326	346328	346329	the scholar	3036	" My good friend , "
346331	346538	346546	346546	Merle	420	" do me two favours , besides the greater one you have already bestowed in conducting me back to a revered friend . First , let me buy of you the contents of that basket ; I have children amongst whom I would divide them as heirlooms ; next , as we were travelling hither , you told me that , in your younger days , ere you took to a craft which does not seem to have prospered , you were brought up to country pursuits , and knew all about cows and sheep , their care and their maladies . Well , I have a few acres of glebe - land on my own hands , not enough for a bailiff - too much for my gardener - and a pretty cottage , which once belonged to a schoolmaster , but we have built him a larger one ; it is now vacant , and at your service . Come and take all trouble of land and stock off my hands ; we shall not quarrel about the salary . But harkye , my friend - on one proviso - give up the Crystal , and leave the Stars to mind their own business . "
346539	346544	346576	346576	himself	420	" Please your Reverence , "
346583	346671	346686	346686	Waife	442	" Please your Reverence , no ! Kit Merle is not so unnatural as to swop away his Significator at Birth for a mess of porritch ! There was that forrin chap , Gally - Leo - he stuck to the stars , or the sun , which is the same thing - and the stars stuck by him , and brought him honour and glory , though the Parsons war dead agin him . He had Malefics in his Ninth House , which belongs to Parsons . "
346672	346684	346686	346686	Waife	442	" Ca n't the matter be compromised , dear Mr. George ? "
346690	346773	346779	346779	George	855	" Suppose Merle promises to keep his crystal and astrological schemes to himself , or at least only talk of them to you ; - they ca n't hurt you , I should think , sir ? And science is a sacred thing , Merle ; and the Chaldees , who were the great star - gazers , never degraded themselves by showing off to the vulgar . Mr. George , who is a scholar , will convince you of that fact . "
346774	346777	346779	346779	George	855	" Content , "
346781	346835	346842	346842	Waife	442	" So long as Mr. Merle will leave my children and servants , and the parish generally , in happy ignorance of the future , I give him the fullest leave to discuss his science with myself whenever we chat together on summer moons or in winter evenings ; and perhaps I may - "
346836	346840	346875	346876	the Parson	16951	" Be converted ? "
346866	346873	346875	346876	the Parson	16951	" I did not mean that , "
346880	346897	346907	346907	Merle	435	" rather the contrary . What say you , Merle ? Is it not a bargain ? "
346898	346905	346907	346907	Merle	435	" Sir - God bless you ! "
346911	346939	347207	347207	he	682	" I see you wo n't let me stand in my own light . And what Gentleman Waife says as to the vulgar , is uncommon true . "
347200	347206	347207	347207	he	682	" A very great man , "
347217	347230	347313	347313	Merle	435	" only he will not have it known - just at present . "
347319	347329	347307	347307	he	682	" You know that gentleman - the old one ? "
347330	347337	347313	347313	Merle	435	" Yes , a many year . "
347338	347345	347307	347307	he	682	" Ever heard anything against him ? "
347346	347355	347313	347313	Merle	435	" Yes , once - at Gatesboro ' . "
347356	347371	347307	347307	he	682	" At Gatesboro ' ! - ah ! and you did not believe it ? "
347372	347381	347392	347392	he	682	" Only jist for a moment , transiting . "
347382	347387	347402	347403	JASPER LOSELY	721	" I envy you , "
347452	347460	348036	348036	he	10013	" WHAT WILT THOU DO WITH IT ? "
348028	348034	348105	348106	his neighbours	3097	" Cutts , come hither , "
348045	348060	348117	348118	the other	2539	" Throw me that cur this way - you , who sit next him . "
348061	348097	348117	348118	the other	2539	" Do n't , do n't ; his mad fit is on him ; he will murder me - murder me , who have helped and saved you all so often . Stand by me . "
348098	348102	348137	348137	Jasper	721	" We will , "
348123	348135	348234	348234	your	10039	" Do you fear I should lop your ears , dog , "
348237	348374	348384	348384	he	10046	" - and he appropriated to himself the brimming glass of his next neighbour . Thus refreshed , he glanced round through the reek of tobacco smoke ; saw the man he had dislodged , and who , rather amazed than stunned by his fall , had kept silence on rising , and was now ominously interchanging muttered words with two of his comrades , who were also on their legs . Jasper turned from him contemptuously ; - with increasing contempt in his hard fierce sneer , noted the lowering frowns on either side the Pandemonium ; and it was only with an angry flash from his eyes that he marked , on closing his survey , the bar dropped across the door , and two forms , knife in hand , stationed at the threshold .
348375	348382	348384	348384	he	10046	" Aha ! my jolly companions , "
348387	348457	348524	348524	Jasper	721	" you do right to bar the door . Prudent families ca n't settle their quarrels too snugly amongst themselves . I am come here on purpose to give you all a proper scolding , and if some of you do n't hang your heads for shame before I have done , you 'll die more game than I think for , whenever you come to the last Drop . "
348515	348521	348524	348524	Jasper	721	" Scum of the earth ! "
348534	348860	348893	348907	the only one who gave audible tongue was that thin splinter of life called Cutts	10053	" I stooped to come amongst you - I shared amongst you my money . Was any one of you too poor to pay up his club fee - to buy a draught of Forgetfulness - I said , ' Brother , take ! ' Did brawl break out in your jollities - were knives drawn - a throat in danger - this right band struck down the uproar , crushed back the coward murder . If I did not join in your rogueries , it was because they were sneaking and pitiful . I came as your Patron , not as your Pal ; I did not meddle with your secrets - did not touch your plunder . I owed you nothing . Offal that you are ! to me you owed drink , and meat , and good fellowship . I gave you mirth , and I gave you Law ; and in return ye laid a plot amongst you to get rid of me ; - how , ye white - livered scoundrels ? Oho ! not by those fists , and knives , and bludgeons . All your pigeon breasts clubbed together had not manhood for that . But to palm off upon me some dastardly deed of your own ; by snares and scraps of false evidence - false oaths , too , no doubt - to smuggle me off to the hangman . That was your precious contrivance . Once again I am here ; but this once only . What for ? - why , to laugh at , and spit at , and spurn you . And if one man amongst you has in him an ounce of man 's blood , let him show me the traitors who planned that pitiful project , and be they a dozen , they shall carry the mark of this hand till their carcasses go to the surgeon 's scalpel . "
348909	349097	349105	349113	the man whom Jasper had flung on the table	10054	" Look you , General Jas . , it was all a mistake your ever coming here . You were a fine fellow once , particularly in the French way of doing business - large prizes and lots of row . That do n't suit us ; we are quiet Englishmen . You brag of beating and bullying the gentlemen who admit you amongst them , and of not sharing their plans or risks ; but that sort of thing is quite out of order - no precedent for it . How do we know that you are not a spy , or could not be made one , since you say you owe us nothing , and hold us in such scorn ? Truth is , we are all sick of you . You say you only come this once : very well , you have spun your yarn - now go . That 's all we want ; go in peace , and never trouble us again . Gentlemen , I move that General Jas . be expelled this club , and requested to withdraw . "
349098	349103	349105	349113	the man whom Jasper had flung on the table	10054	" I second it , "
349115	349142	349149	349149	Jasper	721	" Those who are in favour of the resolution , hold up their hands ; - all - carried unanimously . General Jas . is expelled . "
349143	349147	349310	349311	this knave	10064	" Expel me ! "
349302	349308	349315	349315	Cutts	954	" Shall I shoot him ? "
349322	349331	349458	349458	he	10054	" No ; the noise ! bludgeons safer . "
349463	349522	349737	349737	he	10075	" Down with your arms , each of you - down that knife , down that bludgeon . That 's well . Down yours - there ; yours - yours . What , all down ! Pile them here on the table at my feet . Dogs , what do you fear?-death . The first who refuses dies . "
349542	349731	349777	349777	he	10075	" Unbar the door , you two . You , orator Cutts , go in front ; light a candle - open the street - door . So - so - so . Who will treat me with a parting cup - to your healths ? Thank you , sir . Fall back there ; stand back - along the wall - each of you . Line my way . Ho , ho ! - you harm me - you daunt me - you - you ! Stop - I have a resolution to propose . Hear it , and cheer . ' That this meeting rescinds the resolution for the expulsion of General Jasper , and entreats him humbly to remain , the pride and ornament of the club ! ' Those who are for that resolution , hold up their hands - as many as are against it , theirs . Carried unanimously . Gentlemen , I thank you - proudest day of my life - but I 'll see you hanged first ; and till that sight diverts me , - gentlemen , your health . "
349797	349825	349777	349777	he	10075	" Return that to its owner , with my compliments . One word - speak truth , and fear nothing . Did you send help to Darrell ? "
349826	349833	349777	349777	he	10075	" No ; I swear it . "
349834	349873	349883	349883	Cutts	954	" I am sorry for it . I should like to have owed so trusty a friend that one favour . Go back to your pals . Understand now why I scorned to work with such rotten tools . "
349874	349881	349893	349895	the triumphant bravo	10080	" A wonderful fellow , indeed ! "
349897	349919	350488	350488	she	10097	" All London might look to itself , if he had more solid brains , and less liquid fire in them . "
350477	350487	350488	350488	she	10097	" Oh , it is you , Mr. Losely , "
350501	350558	350571	350571	Jasper	721	" Mistress thought you would come while she was away , and I 'm to get you the bedroom you had , over the stationer 's , six years ago , if you like it . You are to take your meals here , and have the best of everything ; that 's mistress 's orders . "
350559	350569	350571	350571	Jasper	721	" Oh , Mrs. Crane is out of town , "
350576	350582	350488	350488	she	10097	" where has she gone ? "
350583	350589	350571	350571	Jasper	721	" I do n't know . "
350590	350597	350488	350488	she	10097	" When will she be back ? "
350598	350641	351178	351178	he	10099	" In a few days ; so she told me . Will you walk in , and have breakfast ? Mistress said there was to be always plenty in the house - you might come any moment . Please scrape your feet . "
351189	351194	351178	351178	he	10099	" No , no . "
351197	351199	351616	351616	he	10099	" except "
351628	351678	351793	351793	Jasper	721	" Yes , there was a young lady with Lady Montfort ; they did not know her name . They had seen her often in the lawn - seen her too , at church . She was very pretty ; yes , she had blue eyes and fair hair . "
351686	351792	352158	352158	Bridgett	1177	" there had been an old gentleman such as he described - lame , and with one eye - who had lived some months ago in a cottage on Lady Montfort 's grounds . They heard he had gone away . He had made baskets - they did not know if for sale ; if so , perhaps for a charity . They supposed he was a gentleman , for they heard he was some relation to the young lady . But Lady Montfort 's head coachman lived in the village , and could , no doubt , give him all the information he required . "
352161	352172	352278	352278	she	10148	" Mistress is come back , and will see you . "
352241	352257	352372	352372	her	10148	" So you come at last to me , Jasper Losely - you are come . "
352420	352431	353593	353593	she	770	" THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE NEVER DOES RUN SMOOTH ! "
353615	353624	353656	353656	he	1741	" Nothing , now that he had come back "
353662	353688	353705	353705	she	770	" If , during his absence , any one besides George Morley had visited at Lady Montfort 's - any one whom she had seen ? "
353707	353710	353705	353705	she	770	" no , "
353713	353715	353727	353727	she	770	" yes "
353730	353758	353727	353727	she	770	" The young gentleman who - who helped us to buy Sir Isaac , he has visited Lady Montfort - related to some dear friend of hers . "
353759	353765	353727	353727	she	770	" What , the painter ! "
353766	353777	353783	353783	Waife	442	" No - the other , with the dark eyes . "
353778	353781	353727	353727	she	770	" Haughton ! "
353795	353822	354180	354181	Lionel Haughton	419	" Yes - Mr. Haughton ; but he has not been here a long , long time . He will not come again , I believe . "
354167	354172	354354	354354	he	419	" the pretty young gentleman "
354363	354401	354570	354570	Waife	442	" When had Mr. Haughton first presented himself ? - how often had he seen Sophy ? - what had passed between them ? - did not Lady Montfort see that his darling 's heart was breaking ? "
354586	354589	355021	355021	her	846	" Pardon . "
355025	355044	355159	355160	Lady Montfort	770	" I come to tell you that I love you , and that we must part for ever . "
355154	355157	355159	355160	Lady Montfort	770	" Meanwhile , "
355162	355297	355474	355475	Mr. Rugge	438	" I shall never we d again . I shall make it known that I look on your Sophy as the child of my adoption . If I do not live to save sufficient for her out of an income that is more than thrice what I require , I have instructed my lawyers to insure my life for her provision ; it will be ample . Many a wooer , captivating as Lionel , and free from the scruples that fetter his choice , will be proud to kneel at the feet of one so lovely . This rank of mine , which has never yet bestowed on me a joy , now becomes of value , since it will give dignity to - to Matilda 's child , and - and to - "
355479	355488	355734	355735	the woman	2842	" How much you will love one day . "
355774	355779	355950	355950	he	1741	" Mr. Lionel Haughton . "
355953	355986	356007	356007	Lionel	419	" I am really at a loss to conceive the cause of what appears to be meant as congratulations to me and reproaches to yourself , Mr. - , Mr. Haugh - ; "
355996	356005	356018	356018	he	419	" My name shocks you - no wonder , "
356027	356046	356052	356052	Waife	442	" Reproaches to myself ! - Ah , sir , I am here as Charles Haughton 's son ! "
356047	356050	356052	356052	Waife	442	" What ! "
356054	356066	356067	356067	LIONEL	419	" you know ? How could you know that Charles Haughton - "
356071	356087	356088	356088	WAIFE	442	" I know . His own lips confessed his shame to have so injured you . "
356091	356096	356097	356097	LIONEL	419	" Confessed to whom ? "
356100	356137	356172	356172	Lionel	419	" To Alban Morley . Relieve me , my father 's remorse was bitter ; it dies not in his grave , it lives in me . I have so longed to meet with William Losely . "
356186	356254	356172	356172	Lionel	419	" I have just come from Mr. Darrell , where I and Colonel Morley here Lionel 's countenance was darkly troubled have been staying some days . Two days ago I received this letter from George Morley , forwarded to me from London . It says - let me read it : ' You will rejoice to learn that our dear Waife ' - pardon that name . "
356255	356264	356172	356172	Lionel	419	" I have no other - go on . "
356265	356275	356277	356277	Lionel	419	" ' Is once more with his grandchild . ' "
356286	356415	356430	356430	Waife	442	" ' You will rejoice yet more to learn that it has pleased Heaven to allow me and another witness , who , some years ago , had been misled into condemning Waife , to be enabled to bear incontrovertible testimony to the complete innocence of my beloved friend ; nay , more - I say to you most solemnly , that in all which appeared to attest guilt , there has been a virtue , which , if known to Mr. Darrell , would make him bow in reverence to that old man . Tell Mr. Darrell so from me ; and add , that in saying it , I express my conviction of his own admiring sympathy - for all that is noble and heroic . ' "
356416	356427	356430	356430	Waife	442	" Too much - this is too , too much , "
356436	356473	356172	356172	Lionel	419	" but - but , you are folding up the letter . That is all ? - he does not say more ? he does not mention any one else ? - eh ? - eh ? "
356474	356483	356515	356515	he	10256	" No , sir ; that is all . "
356484	356514	356515	356515	he	10256	" Thank Heaven ! He is an honourable man ! Yet he has said more than he ought - much more than he can prove , or than I - "
356523	356551	356172	356172	Lionel	419	" How did Mr. Darrell take these assertions ? With an incredulous laugh - eh ? - ' Why , the old rogue had pleaded guilty ! ' "
356552	356650	356515	356515	he	10256	" Sir , Alban Morley was there to speak of the William Losely whom he had known ; to explain , from facts which he had collected at the time , of what nature was the evidence not brought forward . The motive that induced you to plead guilty I had long guessed ; it flashed in an instant on Guy Darrell ; it was not mere guess with him ! You ask me what he said ? This : ' Grand nature ! George is right ! and I do bow my head in reverence ! ' "
356651	356668	356682	356682	Waife	442	" He said that ? - Guy Darrell ? On your honour , he said that ? "
356669	356681	356694	356694	Lionel	419	" Can you doubt it ? Is he not a gentleman ? "
356687	356692	356694	356694	Lionel	419	" But , sir , "
356696	356781	356515	356515	he	10256	" I must not conceal from you , that though George 's letter and Alban Morley 's communications sufficed to satisfy Darrell , without further question , your old friend was naturally anxious to learn a more full account , in the hope of legally substantiating your innocence . He therefore despatched by the telegraph a request to his nephew to come at once to Fawley . George arrived there yesterday . Do not blame him , sir , that we share his secret . "
356782	356857	356694	356694	Lionel	419	" You do ? Good heavens ! And that lawyer will be barbarous enough to - but no - he has an interest in not accusing of midnight robbery his daughter 's husband ; Jasper 's secret is safe with him . And Colonel Morley - surely his cruel nephew will not suffer him to make me - me , with one foot in the grave - a witness against my Lizzy 's son ! "
356858	357010	357044	357044	Jasper	721	" Colonel Morley , at Darrell 's suggestion , came with me to London ; and if he does not accompany me to you , it is because he is even now busied in finding out your son , not to undo , but to complete the purpose of your self - sacrifice . ' All other considerations , ' said Guy Darrell , ' must be merged in this one thought - that such a father shall not have been in vain a martyr . ' Colonel Morley is empowered to treat with your son on any terms ; but on this condition , that the rest of his life shall inflict no farther pain , no farther fear on you . This is the sole use to which , without your consent , we have presumed to put the secret we have learned . Do you pardon George now ? "
357048	357051	357059	357059	Lionel	419	" Lizzy . "
357052	357057	357059	357059	Lionel	419	" Ah ! why , "
357069	357110	356515	356515	he	10256	" why was I not permitted to be the one to attest your innocence - to clear your name ? I , who owed to you so vast an hereditary debt ! And now - dear , dear Mr. Losely - "
357111	357126	357059	357059	Lionel	419	" Hush ! Waife ! - call me Waife still ! - and always . "
357127	357425	357536	357536	Lionel	419	" Willingly ! It is the name by which I have accustomed myself to love you . Now , listen to me . I am dishonoured until at least the mere pecuniary debt , due to you from my father , is paid . Hist ! Hist ! - Alban Morley says so - Darrell says so . Darrell says , ' he can not own me as kinsman till that debt is cancelled . ' Darrell lends me the means to do it ; he would share his kinsman 's ignominy if he did not . Before I could venture even to come hither , the sum due to you from my father was repaid . I hastened to town yesterday evening - saw Mr. Darrell 's lawyer . I have taken a great liberty - I have invested this sum already in the purchase of an annuity for you . Mr. Darrell 's lawyer had a client who was in immediate want of the sum due to you ; and , not wishing permanently to burthen his estate by mortgage , would give a larger interest by way of annuity than the public offices would ; excellent landed security . The lawyer said it would be a pity to let the opportunity slip , so I ventured to act for you . It was all settled this morning . The particulars are on this paper , which I will leave with you . Of course the sum due to you is not exactly the same as that which my father borrowed before I was born . There is the interest - compound interest ; nothing more . I do n't understand such matters ; Darrell 's lawyer made the calculation - it must be right . "
357508	357534	357536	357536	Lionel	419	" It is quite a business - like computation , I tell you , sir ; all done by a lawyer . It is indeed , "
357546	357602	357610	357610	Waife	433	" Compound interest will run up to what seems a large amount at first ; every child knows that . You ca n't deny Cocker and calculating tables , and that sort of thing . William Losely , you can not leave an eternal load of disgrace on the head of Charles Haughton 's son . "
357603	357608	357610	357610	Waife	433	" Poor Charlie Haughton , "
357612	357662	357536	357536	Lionel	419	" And I was feeling bitter against his memory - bitter against his son . How Heaven loves to teach us the injustice that dwells in anger ! But - but - this can not be . I thank Mr. Darrell humbly - I can not take his money . "
357663	357801	357811	357811	Waife	433	" It is not his money - it is mine ; he only advances it to me . It costs him really nothing , for he deducts the L500 a year from the allowance he makes me . And I do n't want such an absurd allowance as I had before going out of the Guards into the line - I mean to be a soldier in good earnest . Too much pocket - money spoils a soldier - only gets one into scrapes . Alban Morley says the same . Darrell , too , says , ' Right ; no gold could buy a luxury - like the payment of a father 's debt ! ' You can not grudge me that luxury - you dare not - why ? because you are an honest Man . "
357802	357809	357811	357811	Waife	433	" Softly , softly , softly , "
357813	357931	357937	357937	Lionel	419	" Let me look at you . Do n't talk of money now - do n't let us think of money ! What a look of your father ! ' Tis he , ' tis he whom I see before me . Charlie 's sweet bright playful eyes - that might have turned aside from the path of duty - a sheriff 's officer ! Ah ! and Charlie 's happy laugh , too , at the slightest joke ! But THIS is not Charlie 's - it is all your own touching , with gentle finger , Lionel 's broad truthful brow . Poor Charlie , he was grieved - you are right - I remember . "
357932	357935	358016	358016	him	1031	" Sir , "
358002	358002	358261	358261	he	1741	"
358250	358259	358295	358295	Waife	442	" You must go now , young gentleman , "
358287	358293	358295	358295	Waife	442	" Give me your address , "
358297	358316	358231	358231	Waife	442	" I will write about - that paper . Do n't now stay longer - pray - pray . "
358317	358337	358295	358295	Waife	442	" Do not fear , sir . I am not lingering here with the wish to see - her ! "
358342	358392	358295	358295	Waife	442	" Before I asked the servant to announce me I took the precaution to learn that you were alone . But a few words more - hear them patiently . Have you any proof that should satisfy Mr. Darrell 's reason that your Sophy is his daughter 's child ? "
358393	358454	358295	358295	Waife	442	" I have Jasper 's assurance that she is ; and the copy of the nurse 's attestation to the same effect . They satisfied me . I would not have asked Mr. Darrell to be as easily contented ; I could but have asked him to inquire , and satisfy himself . But he would not even hear me . "
358455	358466	358473	358473	Waife	442	" He will hear you now , and with respect . "
358467	358471	358473	358473	Waife	442	" He will ! "
358477	358515	358295	358295	Waife	442	" And if he should inquire and if Sophy should prove to be , as I have ever believed , his daughter 's child , would he not ' own , and receive , and cherish her ? "
358516	358608	358473	358473	Waife	442	" Alas , sir , do not let me pain you ; but that is not my hope . If , indeed , it should prove that your son deceived you - that Sophy is no way related to him - if she should be the child of peasants , but of honest peasants - why , sir , that is my hope , my last hope - for then I would kneel once more at your feet , and implore your permission to win her affection and ask her hand . "
358609	358632	358295	358295	Waife	442	" What ! Mr. Darrell would consent to your union with the child of peasants , and not with his own grandchild ? "
358633	358679	358700	358700	Lionel	419	" Sir , sir , you rack me to the heart ; but if you knew all , you would not wonder to hear me say , ' I dare not ask Mr. Darrell to bless my union with the daughter of Jasper Losely . ' "
358695	358698	358700	358700	Lionel	419	" But , "
358702	358768	358295	358295	Waife	442	" go to Fawley yourself . Seek Darrell ; compare the reasons for your belief with his for rejecting it . At this moment his pride is more subdued than I have ever known it . He will go calmly into the investigation of facts ; the truth will become clear . Sir - dear , dear sir - I am not without a hope . "
358769	358788	358700	358700	Lionel	419	" A hope that the child I have so cherished should be nothing in the world to me ! "
358789	358942	358963	358963	Lionel	419	" - Nothing to you ! Is memory such a shadow ? - is affection such a weathercock ? Has the love between you and Sophy been only the instinct of kindred blood ? Has it not been hallowed by all that makes Age and Childhood so pure a blessing to each other , rooted in trials borne together ? Were you not the first who taught her in wanderings , in privations , to see a Mother in Nature , and pray to a Father which is in Heaven ? Would all this be blotted out of your soul , if she were not the child of that son whom it chills you to remember ? Sir , if there be no tie to replace the mere bond of kindred , why have you taken such vigilant pains to separate a child from him whom you believe to be her father ? "
358956	358961	358963	358963	Lionel	419	" And , sir , "
358972	359102	359112	359112	Waife	442	" can I ask you , whose later life has been one sublime self - sacrifice , whether you would rather that you might call Sophy grandchild , and know her wretched , than know her but as the infant angel whom Heaven sent to your side when bereaved and desolate , and know also that she was happy ? Oh , William Losely , pray with me that Sophy may not be your grandchild . Her home will not be less your home - her attachment will not less replace to you your lost son - and on your knee her children may learn to lisp the same prayers that you taught to her . Go to Darrell - go - go ! and take me with you ! "
359103	359110	359164	359164	He	10282	" I will - I will , "
359122	359163	359537	359538	Guy Darrell	1039	" Come - come ! But Sophy should not learn that you have been here - that I have gone away with you ; it might set her thinking , dreaming , hoping - all to end in greater sorrow . "
359553	359557	359537	359538	Guy Darrell	1039	" I apologise , "
359563	359566	359585	359585	him	1039	" I repent "
359578	359581	359585	359585	him	1039	" I forgive "
359589	359593	359585	359585	him	1039	" I repent , "
359594	359598	359585	359585	him	1039	" I apologise , "
359600	359604	359688	359688	Lionel	419	" I forgive , "
359695	359740	360178	360178	he	419	" Could it be indisputably proved that no drop of Jasper Losely 's blood were in this girl 's veins - that she were the lawful child of honest parents , however humble - my right to stand between her and yourself would cease . "
360167	360177	360178	360178	he	419	" I am very uneasy about our dear friend , "
360185	360356	360364	360364	George	855	" I fear that I have had too little consideration for his years and his sensitive nature , and that , what with the excitement of the conversation that passed between us and the fatigue of the journey , his nerves have broken down . We were not half - way on the road , and as we had the railway - carriage to ourselves , I was talking to him with imprudent earnestness , when he began to tremble all over , and went into an hysterical paroxysm of mingled tears and laughter . I wished to stop at the next station , but he was not long recovering , and insisted on coming on . Still , as we approached Fawley , after muttering to himself , as far as I could catch his words , incoherently , he sank into a heavy state of lethargy or stupor , resting his head on my shoulder . It was with difficulty I roused him when he entered the park . "
360357	360362	360364	360364	George	855	" Poor old man , "
360367	360459	360579	360579	Darrell	512	" no doubt the quick succession of emotions through which he has lately passed has overcome him for the time . But the worst is now passed . His interview with Darrell must cheer his heart and soothe his spirits ; and that interview over , we must give him all repose and nursing . But tell me what passed between you - if he was very indignant that I could not suffer men like you and my uncle Alban and Guy Darrell to believe him a picklock and a thief . "
360569	360577	360579	360579	Darrell	512	" Help me - George - Lionel , "
360581	360594	360603	360603	Mills	571	" to bear him up - stairs . Mills , light us . "
360606	360612	360619	360619	his	512	" Which room , sir ? "
360628	360643	360720	360720	Darrell	512	" My father 's room - he shall rest on my father 's bed . "
360708	360718	360720	360720	Darrell	512	" If I were in my guest 's state , "
360725	360731	360720	360720	Darrell	512	" what would you do ? "
360732	360742	360720	360720	Darrell	512	" Telegraph instantly for Dr. F - - - . "
360743	360776	360799	360799	He	1183	" Lionel - you hear ? Take my own horse - he will carry you like the wind . Off to - - - - ; it is the nearest telegraph station . "
360824	360923	360930	360930	George	855	" I am compelled to leave you for the present , nor could I be of use in staying . I have given all the aid in my power to Nature - we must leave the rest to Nature herself . That fever - those fierce throes and spasms - are but Nature 's efforts to cast off the grasp of the enemy we do not see . It now depends on what degree of rallying power be left to the patient . Fortunately his frame is robust , yet not plethoric . Do you know his habits ? "
360924	360928	360930	360930	George	855	" I know , "
360932	360939	360930	360930	George	855	" most temperate , most innocent . "
360940	360957	360977	360977	Darrell	512	" Then , with constant care , minute attention to my directions , he may recover . "
360958	360975	360979	360980	The physician	10331	" If care and attention can save my guest 's life , he shall not die , "
360992	361019	361026	361026	George	855	" But , Mr. Darrell , I must not have you on my hands too . You must not be out of your bed again tonight . "
361020	361024	361026	361026	George	855	" Certainly not , "
361028	361034	361040	361040	Lionel	419	" I shall watch alone . "
361035	361038	361040	361040	Lionel	419	" No , "
361042	361049	361055	361055	Darrell	512	" that is my post too . "
361050	361053	361055	361055	Darrell	512	" Pooh ! "
361057	361121	361122	361123	Dr. F	1183	" young men so far from Death are not such watchful sentinels against his stroke as men of my years , who have seen him in all aspects ; and , moreover , base indeed in the host who deserts his own guest 's sick - chamber . Fear not for me , doctor ; no man needs sleep less than I do . "
361135	361171	361172	361172	Darrell	512	" Irregular - quick ; but what vitality ! what power ! - a young man 's pulse . Mr. Darrell , many years for your country 's service are yet in these lusty beats . "
361191	361198	361188	361189	the doctor	2598	" When will you come again ? "
361199	361207	361172	361172	Darrell	512	" The day after to - morrow . "
361225	361230	361939	361939	Darrell	512	" temperate , innocent habits "
361941	362027	362048	362048	Waife	442	" Something on the heart , my dear sir ; I ca n't get at it ; perhaps you can . Take off that something , and the springs will react , and my patient will soon recover . All about him sound as a rock - but the heart ; that has been horribly worried ; something worries it now . His heart may be seen in his eye . Watch his eye ; it is missing some face it is accustomed to see . "
362056	362091	362128	362128	Darrell	512	" I was just praying for you - and - and - I am sinking fast . Do not let me die , sir , without wishing poor Sophy a last good - bye ! "
362137	362167	362173	362173	Lionel	419	" Lionel , you must go back to London with Dr. F - - - - . I can not keep you here longer . I want your room . "
362168	362171	362173	362173	Lionel	419	" Sir , "
362177	362192	362128	362128	Darrell	512	" while Waife is still so ill ! You can not be thus unkind . "
362193	362275	363407	363407	he	1741	" Inconsiderate egotist ! would you deprive the old man of a presence dearer to him than yours ? George , you will go too , but you will return . You told me , yesterday , that your wife was in London for a few days ; entreat her to accompany you hither ; entreat her to bring with her the poor young lady whom my guest pines to see at his bedside - the face that his eye misses . "
363415	363465	363565	363565	George	855	" Patience yet , my child ; let me get a little stronger . You see Mr. Darrell will not suffer me to talk with him on matters that must be discussed with him before I go ; and then - and then - Patience till then , Sophhy . "
363577	363599	364353	364353	Fairthorn	570	" Ask no questions . Time , that solves all riddles , is hurrying on , and Heaven directs its movements . "
364365	364410	365221	365221	Darrell	512	" And how dare you foist yourself into this unsullied lineage - how dare you think that the dead would not turn in their graves , ere they would make room in the vault of the Darrells for the daughter of a Jasper Losely ! "
365227	365352	366368	366368	he	512	" Hush - not yet ; remember that it was in the very moment you first broached this sorrowful topic , on arriving here , and perceived how different the point of view from which we two must regard it , that your nerves gave way - your illness rushed on you . Wait , not only till you are stronger , but till we know each other better . This subject is one that it becomes us to treat with all the strength of our reason - with all the calm which either can impose upon the feelings that ruffle judgment . At present , talk we of all matters except that , which I promise you shall be fairly discussed at last . "
366378	366382	366435	366435	he	512	" Pardon me . "
366429	366433	366448	366450	the old man	1741	" William Losely , "
366437	366446	366458	366458	Darrell	512	" Waife , if you please , sir , "
366452	366456	366458	366458	Darrell	512	" William Losely , "
366460	366559	366448	366450	the old man	1741	" justice seeks to repair , so far as , alas ! it now can , the wrongs inflicted on the name of William Losely . Your old friend Alban Morley supplying me with the notes he had made in the matter of your trial , I arranged the evidence they furnished . The Secretary for the Home Department is one of my most intimate political friends - a man of humanity - of sense . I placed that evidence before him . I , George , and Mr. Hartopp , saw him after he had perused it - "
366560	366569	366458	366458	Darrell	512	" My - son - Lizzy 's son ! "
366570	366865	366877	366877	George	855	" His secret will be kept . The question was not who committed the act for which you suffered , but whether you were clearly , incontestably , innocent of the act , and , in pleading guilty , did but sublimely bear the penalty of another . There will be no new trial - there are none who would prosecute . I bring back to you the Queen 's free pardon under the Great Seal . I should explain to you that this form of the royal grace is so rarely given that it needed all the strength and affecting circumstance of your peculiar case to justify the Home Secretary in listening , not only to the interest I could bring to bear in your favour , but to his own humane inclinations . The pardon under the Great Seal differs from an ordinary pardon . It purges the blood from the taint of felony - it remits all the civil disabilities which the mere expiry of a penal sentence does not remove . In short , as applicable to your case , it becomes virtually a complete and formal attestation of your innocence . Alban Morley will take care to apprise those of your old friends who may yet survive , of that revocation of unjust obloquy , which this royal deed implies - Alban Morley , who would turn his back on the highest noble in Britain if but guilty of some jockey trick on the turf ! Live henceforth openly , and in broad daylight if you please ; and trust to us three - the Soldier , the Lawyer , the Churchman - to give to this paper that value which your Sovereign 's advisers intend it to receive . "
366866	366875	366877	366877	George	855	" Your hand now , dear old friend ! "
366879	366905	366913	366913	Waife	442	" You remember I commanded you once to take mine as man and gentleman - as man and gentleman , now honour me with yours . "
366906	366911	366928	366928	Darrell	512	" Is it possible ? "
366930	366969	366877	366877	George	855	" is it possible ? I vindicated - I cleared - and yet no felon 's dock for Jasper ! - the son not criminated by the father 's acquittal ! Tell me that ! again - again ! "
366970	367012	367033	367034	the preacher	5548	" It is so , believe me . All that rests is to force on that son , if he have a human heart , the conviction that he will be worse than a parricide if he will not save himself . "
367013	367031	367042	367042	Darrell	512	" And he will - he shall . Oh , that I could but get at him ! "
367036	367040	367042	367042	Darrell	512	" And now , "
367044	367067	367086	367086	Darrell	512	" now , George , leave us ; for now , upon equal terms , we two fathers can discuss family differences . "
367078	367084	367118	367118	Darrell	512	" I take this moment , "
367110	367116	367118	367118	Darrell	512	" I take this moment , "
367120	367264	367265	367265	WAIFE	442	" the first moment in which you can feel thoroughly assured that no prejudice against yourself clouds my judgment in reference to her whom you believe to be your grandchild , to commence , and I trust to conclude forever , the subject which twice brought you within these walls . On the night of your recent arrival here , you gave this copy of a French woman 's declaration , to the effect that two infants had been placed out with her to nurse ; that one of them was my poor daughter 's infant , who was about to be taken away from her ; that the other was confided to her by its parent , a French lady , whom she speaks of as a very liberal and distinguished person , but whose name is not stated in the paper . "
367268	367302	367303	367303	DARRELL	512	" The confession describes that lady as an artiste ; distinguished artiste is the expression - viz . , a professional person - a painter - an actress - a singer - or - "
367307	367519	367536	367539	the ex - comedian	5763	" An opera - dancer ! I understand the French word perfectly . And I presume the name is not mentioned in the document , from motives of delicacy ; the child of a distinguished French artiste is not necessarily born in wedlock . But this lady was very grateful to the nurse for the care shown to her infant , who was very sickly ; and promised to take the nurse , and the nurse 's husband also , into her service . The nurse states that she herself was very poor ; that the lady 's offer appeared to her like a permanent provision ; that the life of this artiste 's infant was of the utmost value to her - the life of my poor daughter 's child of comparative insignificance . But the infant of the artiste died , and the nurse 's husband put it into his wife 's head to tell your son then a widower , and who had seen so little of his child as to be easily deceived , that it was his infant who died . The nurse shortly afterwards removed to Paris , taking with her to the artiste 's house the child who in reality was my daughter 's . "
367520	367534	367550	367553	the ex - lawyer	10530	" It seems very probable , does it not - does it not ? "
367542	367548	367550	367553	the ex - lawyer	10530	" It seems to me , "
367555	367927	368103	368103	Waife	442	" very probable that a witness , entering into court with the confession of one villanous falsehood , would have little scruple to tell another . But I proceed . This rich and liberal artiste dies ; the nurse 's conscience then suddenly awakens - she sees Mr. Hammond - she informs him of the fraud she has practised . A lady of rank , who had known Matilda , and had seen both the infants when both were living under the nurse 's charge , and observed them more attentively than your son had done - corroborates the woman 's story , stating that the artiste 's child had dark eyes instead of blue ; that the artiste herself was never deceived - but , having taken a great fancy to the spurious infant , was willing to receive and cherish it as her own ; and that she knows several persons who will depose that they heard the artiste say that the child was not her own . On this evidence your son takes to himself this child - and this child is your Sophy - and you wish me to acknowledge her as my daughter 's offspring . Do not look me so earnestly in the face , my dear and respected guest . It was when you read in my face what my lips shrank from uttering that your emotions overcame your strength , and your very mind deserted you . Now , be firmer . Your Sophy has no need of me - she is under your charge , and your name is cleared . She has found a friend - a protectress - in her own sex . Lady Montfort 's rank gives to her a position in the world as high as I could offer ; and as to mere pecuniary provision for her , make your mind easy - it shall be secured . But bear with me when I add , resolutely and calmly , that this nurse 's attestation is to me a grosser and poorer attempt at imposture than I had anticipated ; and I am amazed that a man of your abilities should have been contented to accept it . "
367928	368066	368103	368103	Waife	442	" Oh , Mr. Darrell , do n't say so ! It was such a blessing to think , when my son was lost to me , that I might fill up the void in my heart with an innocent , loving child . Do n't talk of my abilities . If you , whose abilities none can question - if you had longed and yearned for such a comforter - if you had wished - if you wished now this tale to be true , you would have believed it too ; you would believe it now - you would indeed . Two men look so differently at the same story - one deeply interested that it should be true - one determined , if possible , to find it false . Is it not so ? "
368106	368142	368103	368103	Waife	442	" And whatever seems most improbable in this confession , is rendered probable at once - if - if - we may assume that my unhappy son , tempted by the desire to - to - "
368143	368372	368103	368103	Waife	442	" Spare yourself - I understand - if your son wished to obtain his wife 's fortune , and therefore connived at the exchange of the infants , and was therefore , too , enabled always to corroborate the story of the exchange whenever it suited him to reclaim the infant , I grant this - and I grant that the conjecture is sufficiently plausible to justify you in attaching to it much weight . We will allow that it was his interest at one time to represent his child , though living , as no more ; but you must allow also that he would have deemed it his interest later , to fasten upon me , as my daughter 's , a child to whom she never gave birth . Here we entangle ourselves in a controversy without data , without facts . Let us close it . Believe what you please . Why should I shake convictions that render you happy ? Be equally forbearing with me . I do full justice to your Sophy 's charming qualities . In herself , the proudest parent might rejoice to own her ; but I can not acknowledge her to be the daughter of Matilda Darrell . And the story that assured you she was your grandchild , still more convinces me that she is not mine ! "
368373	368450	368103	368103	Waife	442	" But be not thus inflexible , I implore you ; - you can be so kind , so gentle ; - she would be such a blessing to you - later - perhaps - when I am dead . I am pleading for your sake - I owe you so much ! I should repay you , if I could but induce you to inquire - and if inquiry should prove that I am right . "
368451	368457	368103	368103	Waife	442	" I have inquired sufficiently . "
368458	368478	368103	368103	Waife	442	" ' Then I 'll go and find out the nurse . I 'll question her . I 'll - "
368479	368493	368103	368103	Waife	442	" Hold . Be persuaded ! Hug your belief ! Inquire no farther ! "
368494	368499	368504	368504	Waife	442	" Why - why ? "
368519	368668	368727	368727	Waife	442	" But if I could prove her not to be my grandchild , then she might be happy ! - then - then - ah , sir , young Haughton tells me that if she were but the daughter of honest parents - no child of Jasper 's , no grandchild of mine - then you might not be too proud to bless her at least as his bride ! And , sir , the poor child loves the young man . How could she help it ? And , at her age , life without hope is either very short , or very , very long ! Let me inquire ! I should be happy even to know that she was not my grandchild . I should not love her less ; and then she would have others to love her when I am gone to Lizzy ! "
368720	368725	368742	368742	I	0	" Yes , sir , "
368751	368751	368779	368779	He	512	"
368798	368838	368779	368779	He	512	" I entreat you not ! Do you suppose that I would not resume inquiry in person , nor pause till the truth were made amply clear , if I had not strong reason to prefer doubt to certainty ? "
368839	368847	368779	368779	He	512	" What do you mean , sir ? "
368848	368956	368779	368779	He	512	" There is a woman whose career is , I believe , at this moment revived into fresh notoriety as the heroine of some drama on the stage of Paris - a woman who , when years paled her fame and reft her spoils , as a courtesan renowned for the fools she had beggared , for the young hearts she had corrupted , sought plunder still by crimes , to which law is less lenient ; charged with swindling , with fraud , with forgery , and at last more than suspected as a practised poisoner , she escaped by suicide the judgment of human tribunals . "
368957	369013	368779	368779	He	512	" I know of whom you speak - that dreadful Gabrielle Desmarets , but for whom my sacrifice to Jasper 's future might not have been in vain ! It was to save Sophy from the chance of Jasper 's ever placing her within reach of that woman 's example that I took her away . "
369014	369052	369070	369070	he	10534	" Is it not , then , better to forbear asking who were your Sophy 's parents , than to learn from inquiry that she is indeed your grandchild , and that her mother was Gabrielle Desmarets ? "
369073	369089	368779	368779	He	512	" I am certain it is not so ! Did you ever see that woman ? "
369090	369184	369070	369070	he	10534	" Never that I know of ; but George tells me that he heard your son state to you that she had made acquaintance with me under another name , and if there was a design to employ her in confirmation of his tale - if he was then speaking truth to you , doubtless this was the lady of rank referred to in the nurse 's confession - doubtless this was the woman once palmed upon me as Matilda 's confidante . In that case I have seen her . What then ? "
369185	369255	369269	369269	Darrell	512	" Mother was not written on her face ! She could never have been a mother . Oh , you may smile , sir ; but all my life I have been a reader of the human face ; and there is in the aspect of some women the barrenness as of stone - no mother 's throb in their bosom - no mother 's kiss on their lips . "
369256	369267	369269	369269	Darrell	512	" I am a poor reader of women 's faces , "
369271	369462	369468	369468	he	10535	" but she must be very unlike women in general , who allows you to know her a bit better if you stood reading her face till doomsday . Besides , at the time you saw Gabrielle Desmarets , her mode of life had perhaps given to her an aspect not originally in her countenance . And I can only answer your poetic conceit by a poetic illustration - Niobe turned to stone ; but she had a great many daughters before she petrified . Pardon me , if I would turn off by a jest a thought that I see would shock you , as myself , if gravely encouraged . Encourage it not . Let us suppose it only a chance that inquiry might confirm this conjecture ; but let us shun that chance . Meanwhile , if inquiry is to be made , one more likely than either of us to get at the truth has promised to make it , and sooner or later we may learn from her the results - I mean that ill - fated Arabella Fossett , whom you knew as Crane . "
369501	369514	369515	369515	Darrell	512	" And this thing is of no use to her , then ? "
369529	369583	369468	369468	he	10535	" Friend , do not fancy that the young have only one path to happiness . You grieve that I can not consent to Lionel 's marriage with your Sophy . Dismiss from your mind the desire for the Impossible . Gently wean from hers what is but a girl 's first fancy . "
369584	369593	369602	369602	Darrell	512	" It is a girl 's first love . "
369594	369600	369602	369602	Darrell	512	" And if it be , "
369606	369859	369871	369871	Waife	442	" no complaint more sure to yield to change of air . I have known a girl as affectionate , as pure , as full of all womanly virtues , as your Sophy and I can give her no higher praise - loved more deeply than Lionel can love ; professing , doubtless at the time believing , that she also loved for life ; betrothed too ; faith solemnised by promise ; yet in less than a year she was another 's wife . Change of air , change of heart ! I do not underrate the effect which a young man , so winning as Lionel , would naturally produce on the fancy or the feelings of a girl , who as yet , too , has seen no others ; but impressions in youth are characters in the sand . Grave them ever so deeply , the tide rolls over them ; and when the ebb shows the surface again , the characters are gone , for the sands are shifted . Courage ! Lady Montfort will present to her others with forms as fair as Lionel 's , and as elegantly dressed . With so much in her own favour , there are young patricians enough who will care not a rush what her birth ; - young lords - Lady Montfort knows well how fascinating young lords can be ! Courage ! before a year is out , you will find new characters written on the sand . "
369860	369869	369871	369871	Waife	442	" You do n't know Sophy , sir , "
369875	369923	370314	370314	Mills	571	" and I see you are resolved not to know her . But you say Arabella Crane is to inquire ; and should the inquiry prove that she is no child of Gabrielle Desmarets - that she is either your own grandchild or not mine - that - "
369924	370304	370722	370722	she	442	" Let me interrupt you . If there be a thing in the world that is cruel and treacherous , it is a false hope ! Crush out of every longing thought the belief that this poor girl can prove to be one whom , with my consent , my kinsman can woo to be his wife . Lionel Haughton is the sole kinsman left to whom I can bequeath this roof - tree - these acres hallowed to me because associated with my earliest lessons in honour and with the dreams which directed my life . He must take with the heritage the name it represents . In his children , that name of Darrell can alone live still in the land . I say to you , that even were my daughter now in existence , she would not succeed me - she would not inherit nor transmit that name . Why ? - not because I am incapable of a Christian 's forgiveness , but because I am not capable of a gentleman 's treason to his ancestors and himself ; - because Matilda Darrell was false and perfidious ; because she was dead to honour , and therefore her birthright to a heritage of honour was irrevocably forfeited . And since you compel me to speak rudely , while in you I revere a man above the power of law to degrade - while , could we pass a generation , and Sophy were your child by your Lizzy , I should proudly welcome an alliance that made you and me as brothers - yet I can not contemplate - it is beyond my power - I can not contemplate the picture of Jasper Losely 's daughter , even by my own child , the Mistress in my father 's home - the bearer of my father 's name . ' Tis in vain to argue . Grant me the slave of a prejudice - grant these ideas to be antiquated bigotry - I am too old to change . I ask from others no sacrifice which I have not borne . And whatever be Lionel 's grief at my resolve , grief will be my companion long after he has forgotten that he mourned . "
370735	370744	370745	370745	Waife	442	" Grandfather , may I read that letter ? "
370755	370761	370772	370772	she	442	" No , my dear . "
370762	370770	370789	370789	she	442	" It is better that I should , "
370808	370816	370924	370924	he	1741	" But as you please , grandfather . "
370937	370949	370982	370982	he	1741	" Only about me , Sophy ; what does that matter ? "
370972	370980	371188	371188	Waife	442	" Do n't read on , Sophy , "
371198	371264	371271	371271	Sophy	442	" You will bear it , Sophy ! The worst is over now . Fortitude , my child ! - fortitude ! The human heart is wonderfully sustained when it is not the conscience that weighs it down - griefs , that we think at the moment must kill us , wear themselves away . I speak the truth , for I too have suffered ! "
371265	371269	371488	371488	she	442	" Poor grandfather ! "
371499	371566	371823	371823	he	1741	" Please , dear grandfather , tell me all about what has happened to yourself , which should make us glad - that is , by - and - by ; but nothing as to the rest of that letter . I will just think over it by myself ; but never let us talk of it , grandy dear , never more - never more . "
371833	371852	371865	371865	she	1300	" The sun is quite bright now , Sophy ; go out for a little while , darling . "
371870	371875	371896	371896	she	1300	" Yes , presently . "
371910	371945	371953	371953	Sophy	442	" Sophy , dear , it is time to take your walk ; go - Mrs. Morley is in front , before my window . I have called to her to wait for you . "
371946	371951	371966	371966	He	1741	" Yes - presently , "
371988	372021	372265	372265	he	1039	" Sophy , I should like to hobble out and breathe the air ; it will do me good . Will you give me your arm ? I am still very weak . "
372271	372280	372265	372265	he	1039	" See the wretch who long has tost , "
372285	372301	372351	372351	her	442	" The common sun , the air , the skies , To him are opening paradise "
372338	372348	372542	372543	Poor Waife	1194	" the sun , the air , the skies , "
372567	372594	372750	372750	he	512	" He relents . I will not go to - morrow as I had intended . Sophy must win her way ; who can resist her ? "
372755	372770	372903	372903	she	442	" Tut , it will soon pass - only a girl 's first fancy . "
372918	372936	372903	372903	she	442	" Now , dear grandfather - all about yourself - what happy thing has chanced to you ? "
372964	373800	373968	373969	her grandfather	11191	" You know that , on my own account , I had reasons for secresy - change of name . I shunned all those whom I had ever known in former days ; could take no calling in life by which I might be recognised ; deemed it a blessed mercy of Providence that when , not able to resist offers that would have enabled me to provide for you as I never otherwise could , I assented to hazard an engagement at a London theatre - trusting for my incognito to an actor 's arts of disguise - came the accident which , of itself , annihilated the temptation into which I had suffered myself to be led . For , ah , child ! had it been known who and what was the William Waife whose stage - mime tricks moved harmless mirth , or tears as pleasant , the audience would have risen , not to applaud , but hoot , ' Off , off , ' from both worlds - the Mimic as the Real ! Well , had I been dishonest , you - you alone felt that I could not have dared to take you , guiltless infant , by the hand . You remember that , on my return to Rugge 's wandering theatre , bringing you with me , I exaggerated the effects of my accident - affected to have lost voice - stipulated to be spared appearing on his stage . That was not the mere pride of manhood shrinking from the display of physical afflictions . No . In the first village that we arrived at , I recognised an old friend , and I saw that , in spite of time , and the accident that had disfigured me , he recognised me , and turned away his face , as if in loathing . An old friend , Sophy - an old friend ! Oh , it pierced me to the heart ; and I resolved , from that day , to escape from Rugge 's stage ; and I consented till the means of escape , and some less dependent mode of livelihood , were found , to live on thy earnings , child ; for if I were discovered by other old friends , and they spoke out , my disgrace would reflect on you ; and better to accept support , from you than that ! Alas ! appearances were so strong against me , I never deemed they could be cleared away , even from the sight of my nearest friends . But Providence , you know , has been so kind to us hitherto ; and so Providence will be kind to us again , Sophy . And now , the very man I thought most hard to me - this very Guy Darrell , under whose roof we are - has been the man to make those whose opinion I most value know that I am not dishonest ; and Providence has raised a witness on my behalf in that very Mr. Hartopp , who judged me and any one else might have done the same too bad to be fit company for you ! And that is why I am congratulated ; and , oh , Sophy , though I have borne it as Heaven does enable us to bear what of ourselves we could not , and though one learns to shrug a patient shoulder under the obloquy which may be heaped on us by that crowd of mere strangers to us and to each other , which is called ' the WORLD , ' yet to slink out of sight from a friend , as one more to be shunned than a foe - to take like a coward the lashings of Scorn - to wince , one raw sore , from the kindness of Pity - to feel that in life the sole end of each shift and contrivance is to slip the view - hallo , into a grave without epitaph , by paths as stealthy and sly as the poor hunted fox , when his last chance - and sole one - is , by winding and doubling , to run under the earth ; to know that it would be an ungrateful imposture to take chair at the board - at the hearth , of the man who , unknowing your secret , says , ' Friend , be social ' ; accepting not a crust that one does not pay for , lest one feel a swindler to the kind fellow - creature whose equal we must not be ! - all this - all this , Sophy , did at times chafe and gall more than I ought to have let it do , considering that there was ONE who saw it all , and would - Do n't cry , Sophy ; it is all over now . "
373801	373814	372903	372903	she	442	" Not cry ! Oh , it does me so much good . "
373815	373923	374229	374229	she	442	" All over now ! I am under this roof - without shame or scruple ; and if Guy Darrell , knowing all my past , has proved my innocence in the eyes of those whom alone I cared for , I feel as if I had the right to stand before any crowd of men erect and shameless - a Man once more with Men ! Oh , darling ! let me but see thy old happy smile again ! The happy smiles of the young are the sunshine of the old . Be patient - be firm ; Providence is so very kind , Sophy . "
374221	374228	374229	374229	she	442	" You must scold my grandfather , "
374232	374265	374271	374271	Waife	442	" He chooses to fancy that he is not well enough yet to leave ; and I am sure that he is , and will recover more quickly at home than here . "
374266	374269	374271	374271	Waife	442	" Pooh ! "
374273	374333	374384	374384	George	855	" you young things suppose we old folks can be as brisk as yourselves ; but if I am to be scolded , leave Mr. George unawed by your presence , and go out , my dear , while the sun lasts : I know by the ways of that blackbird that the day will be overcast by noon . "
374345	374382	374405	374405	Waife	442	" Your Sophy is looking very ill , and if you are well enough to leave , it might be better for her to move from this gloomy house . Movement itself is a great restorative , "
374389	374403	374405	374405	Waife	442	" You see , then , that she looks ill - very ill , "
374408	374424	374523	374523	Waife	442	" and there is that in your manner which tells me you guess the cause . "
374425	374474	374485	374485	Waife	442	" I do guess it from the glimpse which I caught of Lionel 's face after he had been closeted a short time with Mr. Darrell at my uncle 's house two days ago . I guess it also from a letter I have received from my uncle . "
374475	374483	374485	374485	Waife	442	" You guess right - very right , "
374496	374509	374602	374602	George	855	" I showed her this letter from young Haughton . Read it . "
374526	374601	374614	374614	Waife	442	" I was frightened yesterday by the strange composure she showed . In her face alone could be read what she suffered . We talked last night . I spoke of myself - of my old sorrows - in order to give her strength to support hers ; and the girl has a heroic nature , Mr. George - and she is resolved to conquer or to die . But she will not conquer . "
374618	374831	374614	374614	Waife	442	" All that you can say , Mr. George , I know beforehand ; and she will need no exhortation to prayer and to fortitude . I stole from my room when it was almost dawn . I saw a light under the door of her chamber . I just looked in - softly - unperceived . She had not gone to bed . She was by the open window - stars dying out of the sky - kneeling on the floor , her face buried in her hands . She has prayed . In her soul , at this moment , be sure that she is praying now . She will devote herself to me - she will be cheerful - you will hear her laugh , Mr. George ; but she will not conquer in this world ; long before the new year is out , she will be looking down upon our grief with her bright smile ; but we shall not see her , Mr. George . Do not think this is an old man 's foolish terror ; I know sorrow as physicians know disease ; it has its mortal symptoms . Hush ! hear me out . I have one hope - it is in you . "
374832	374836	375120	375122	The old man	1741	" In me ? "
374837	375119	375231	375231	his	1741	" Yes . Do you remember that you said , if I could succeed in opening to your intellect its fair career , you would be the best friend to me man ever had ? and I said , ' Agreed , but change the party in the contract ; befriend my Sophy instead of me , and if ever I ask you , help me in aught for her welfare and happiness ; ' and you said , ' With heart and soul . ' That was the bargain , Mr. George . Now you have all that you then despaired of ; you have the dignity of your sacred calling - you have the eloquence of the preacher . I can not cope with Mr. Darrell - you can . He has a heart - it can be softened ; he has a soul - it can be freed from the wither that tether it down ; he has the virtues you can appeal to ; and he has the pride which you , as a Christian minister , have the right to prove to be a sin . I can not argue with him ; I can not reprove the man to whom I owe so much . All ranks of men and of mind should be equal to you , the pastor , the divine . You ministers of the gospel address yourselves unabashed to the poor , the humble , the uninstructed . Did Heaven give you power and commandment over these alone ? Go , Preacher ! go ! Speak with the same authority to the great , to the haughty , to the wise ! "
375245	375392	375404	375404	George	855	" Ay , if you were but the commonplace priest ! But , you are something more ; you are the priest specially endowed for all special purposes of good . You have the mind to reason - the tongue to persuade - the majestic earnestness of impassioned zeal . Nor are you here the priest alone ; you are here the friend , the confidant , of all for whom you may exert your powers . Oh , George Morley , I am a poor ignorant blunderer when presuming to exhort you as Christian minister ; but in your own words - I address you as man and gentleman , you declared that ' thought and zeal should not stammer whenever I said , Keep your promise . ' I say it now - Keep faith to the child you swore to me to befriend ! "
375393	375402	375404	375404	George	855	" I will go - and at once , "
375408	375437	375446	375446	Waife	442	" But be not sanguine . I see not a chance of success . A man so superior to myself in years , station , abilities , repute ! "
375438	375444	375446	375446	Waife	442	" Where would be Christianity , "
375448	375472	375798	375798	Darrell	512	" if the earliest preachers had raised such questions ? There is a soldier 's courage - is there not a priest 's ? "
375801	375858	375870	375870	he	419	" I trust that , in bringing to William Losely this intelligence , I shall at least soften his disappointment , when I make it thoroughly clear to him how impossible it is that his Sophy can ever be more to me - to us - than a stranger whose virtues create an interest in her welfare "
375873	375886	375895	375895	Darrell	512	" You have seen her - and your resolve remains the same . "
375887	375893	375945	375946	The Colonel	13877	" Can you doubt it ? "
375902	375944	375985	375985	he	13877	" The resolve may now give me pain on my account , as before it gave me pain on yours . But if not moved by your pain , can I be moved by mine ? That would be a baseness . "
375977	375983	375985	375985	he	13877	" I do not say , "
375987	376434	377163	377163	Alban	628	" that Lionel will guiltily seek death in the field , nor does death there come more to those who seek than to those who shun it ; but he will go upon a service exposed to more than ordinary suffering , privation , and disease - without that rallying power of hope - that Will , and Desire to Live , which constitute the true stamina of Youth . And I have always set a black mark upon those who go into war joyless and despondent . Send a young fellow to the camp with his spirits broken , his heart heavy as a lump of lead , and the first of those epidemics , which thin ranks more than the cannon , says to itself , ' There is a man for me ! ' Any doctor will tell you that , even at home , the gay and light - hearted walk safe through the pestilence , which settles on the moping as malaria settles on a marsh . Confound Guy Darrell 's ancestors , they have spoilt Queen Victoria as good a young soldier as ever wore a sword by his side ! Six months ago , and how blithely Lionel Haughton looked forth to the future ! - all laurel ! - no cypress ! And now I feel as if I had shaken hands with a victim sacrificed by Superstition to the tombs of the dead . I can not blame Darrell : I dare say in the same position I might do the same . But no ; on second thoughts , I should not . If Darrell does not choose to marry and have sons of his own , he has no right to load a poor boy with benefits , and say : ' There is but one way to prove your gratitude ; remember my ancestors , and be miserable for the rest of your days ! ' Darrell , forsooth , intends to leave to Lionel the transmission of the old Darrell name ; and the old Darrell name must not be tarnished by the marriage on which Lionel has unluckily set his heart ! I respect the old name ; but it is not like the House of Vipont - a British Institution . And if some democratical cholera , which does not care a rush for old names , carries off Lionel , what becomes of the old name then ? Lionel is not Darrell 's son ; Lionel need not perforce take the old name . Let the young man live as Lionel Haughton , and the old name die with Guy Darrell !
376435	377159	377163	377163	Alban	628	" As to the poor girl 's birth and parentage , I believe we shall never know them . I quite agree with Darrell that it will be wisest never to inquire . But I dismiss , as farfetched and improbable , his supposition that she is Gabrielle Desmaret 's daughter . To me it is infinitely more likely , either that the deposition of the nurse , which poor Willy gave to Darrell , and which Darrell showed to me , is true only that Jasper was conniving at the temporary suspension of his child 's existence while it suited his purpose - or that , at the worst , this mysterious young lady is the daughter of the artiste . In the former supposition , as I have said over and over again , a marriage between Lionel and Sophy is precisely that which Darrell should desire ; in the latter case , of course , if Lionel were the head of the House of Vipont , the idea of such an union would be inadmissible . But Lionel , entre nous , is the son of a ruined spendthrift by a linen - draper 's daughter . And Darrell has but to give the handsome young couple five or six thousand a year , and I know the world well enough to know that the world will trouble itself very little about their pedigrees . And really Lionel should be left wholly free to choose whether he prefer a girl whom he loves with his whole heart , five or six thousand a year , happiness , and the chance of honours in a glorious profession to which he will then look with glad spirits - or a life - long misery , with the right , after Darrell 's death - that I hope will not be these thirty years - to bear the name of Darrell instead of Haughton ; which , if I were the last of the Haughtons , and had any family pride - as , thank Heaven I have not - would be a painful exchange to me ; and dearly bought by the addition of some additional thousands a year , when I had grown perhaps as little disposed to spend them as Guy Darrell himself is . But , after all , there is one I compassionate even more than young Haughton . My morning rides of late have been much in the direction of Twickenham , visiting our fair cousin Lady Montfort . I went first to lecture her for letting these young people see so much of each other . But my anger melted into admiration and sympathy when I found with what tender , exquisite , matchless friendship she had been all the while scheming for Darrell 's happiness ; and with what remorse she now contemplated the sorrow which a friendship so grateful , and a belief so natural , had innocently occasioned . That remorse is wearing her to death . Dr. F - - - , who attended poor dear Willy , is also attending her ; and he told me privately that his skill was in vain - that her case baffled him ; and he had very serious apprehensions . Darrell owes some consideration to such a friend . And to think that here are lives permanently embittered , if not risked , by the ruthless obstinacy of the best - hearted man I ever met ! Now , though I have already intimated my opinions to Darrell with a candour due to the oldest and dearest of my friends , yet I have never , of course , in the letters I have written to him or the talk we have had together , spoken out so plainly as I do in writing to you . And having thus written , without awe of his grey eye and dark brow , I have half as mind to add ' seize him in a happy moment and show him this letter . ' Yes , I give you full leave ; show it to him if you think it would avail . If not , throw it into the fire , and - pray Heaven for those whom we poor mortals can not serve . "
377169	377190	377310	377310	Darrell	512	" But of course , before showing the enclosed , you will prepare Darrell 's mind to weigh its contents . "
377324	377366	377457	377457	Darrell	512	" that , on reflection , Alban submitted direct to his old school - fellow the reasonings and apprehensions which he had so unreservedly poured forth in a letter commenced without the intention at which the writer arrived at the close . "
377464	377469	377457	377457	Darrell	512	" Who 's there ? "
377470	377474	377457	377457	Darrell	512	" George Morley . "

377499	377513	377457	377457	Darrell	512	" A GOOD MAN IS NO MORE TO BE FEARED THAN A SHEEP . "
377514	377536	377457	377457	Darrell	512	" A GOOD SURGEON MUST HAVE AN EAGLE 'S EYE , A LION 'S HEART , AND A LADY 'S HAND . "
377537	377546	377585	377585	George	855	" A GOOD TONGUE IS A GOOD WEAPON . "
377579	377583	377585	377585	George	855	" I come , "
377587	377617	377658	377658	Darrell	512	" to ask you one of the greatest favours a man can confer upon another ; it will take some little time to explain . Are you at leisure ? "
377623	377657	377658	377658	Darrell	512	" Seat yourself in comfort , my dear George . If it be in my power to serve or to gratify Alban Morley 's nephew , it is I who receive a favour . "
377663	377680	377681	377682	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" The young man is ambitious - I may aid in his path towards a See ! "
377685	377766	377776	377776	Darrell	512	" First let me say that I would consult your intellect on a matter which habitually attracts and engages mine - that old vexed question of the origin and uses of Evil , not only in the physical , but the moral world ; it involves problems over which I would ponder for hours as a boy - on which I wrote essays as a schoolman - on which I perpetually collect illustrations to fortify my views as a theologian . "
377767	377774	377776	377776	Darrell	512	" He is writing a book , "
377780	377798	377799	377800	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" and a book on such a subject will last him all his life . Happy man ! "
377803	377941	377942	377942	DARRELL	512	" The Pastor , you know , is frequently consulted by the suffering and oppressed ; frequently called upon to answer that question in which the scepticism of the humble and the ignorant ordinarily begins : ' Why am I suffering ? Why am I oppressed ? Is this the justice of Providence ? Has the Great Father that benign pity , that watchful care for His children , which you preachers tell us ? ' Ever intent on deducing examples from the lives to which the clue has become apparent , must be the Priest who has to reason with Affliction caused by no apparent fault ; and where , judged by the Canons of Human justice , cloud and darkness obscure the Divine - still to ' vindicate the ways of God to man . ' "
377945	377983	377984	377985	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" A philosophy that preceded , and will outlive , all other schools . It is twin - born with the world itself . Go on ; though the theme be inexhaustible , its interest never flags . "
377988	378030	378031	378031	DARRELL	512	" Has it struck you , Mr. Darrell , that few lives have ever passed under your survey ; in which the inexpressible tenderness of the Omniscient has been more visibly clear than in that of your guest , William Losely ? "
378035	378243	378244	378245	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" Clear ? To me , I confess that if ever there were an instance in which the Divine tenderness , the Divine justice , which I can never presume to doubt , was yet undiscernible to my bounded vision , it is in the instance of the very life you refer to . I see a man of admirable virtues - of a childlike simplicity of character , which makes him almost unconscious of the grandeur of his own soul - involved by a sublime self - sacrifice - by a virtue , not by a fault - in the most dreadful of human calamities - ignominious degradation ; - hurled in the midday of life from the sphere of honest men - a felon 's brand on his name - a vagrant in his age ; justice at last , but tardy and niggard , and giving him but little joy when it arrives ; because , ever thinking only of others , his heart is wrapped in a child whom he can not make happy in the way in which his hopes have been set ! - George - no , your illustration might be turned by a sceptic into an argument against you . "
378248	378484	378494	378494	Darrell	512	" Not unless the sceptic refused the elementary starting - ground from which you and I may reason ; not if it be granted that man has a soul , which it is the object of this life to enrich and develop for another . We know from my uncle what William Losely was before this calamity befell him - a genial boon - companion - a careless , frank , ' good fellow ' - all the virtues you now praise in him dormant , unguessed even by himself . Suddenly came CALAMITY ! - suddenly arose the SOUL ! Degradation of name , and with it dignity of nature ! How poor , how slight , how insignificant William Losely the hanger - on of rural Thanes compared with that William Waife whose entrance into this house , you - despite that felon 's brand when you knew it was the martyr 's glory , - greeted with noble reverence ; whom , when the mind itself was stricken down - only the soul left to the wreck of the body - you tended with such pious care as he lay on - your father 's bed ! And do you , who hold Nobleness in such honour - do you , of all men , tell me that you can not recognise that Celestial tenderness which ennobled a Spirit for all Eternity ? "
378485	378492	378494	378494	Darrell	512	" George , you are right , "
378496	378527	378528	378529	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" and I was a blockhead and blunderer , as man always is when he mistakes a speck in his telescope for a blotch in the sun of a system . "
378532	378736	379003	379003	Darrell	512	" But more difficult it is to recognise the mysterious agencies of Heavenly Love when no great worldly adversity forces us to pause and question . Let Fortune strike down a victim , and even the heathen cries , ' This is the hand of God ! ' But where Fortune brings no vicissitude ; where her wheel runs smooth , dropping wealth or honours as it rolls - where Affliction centres its work within the secret , unrevealing heart - there , even the wisest man may not readily perceive by what means Heaven is admonishing , forcing , or wooing him nearer to itself . I take the case of a man in whom Heaven acknowledges a favoured son . I assume his outward life crowned with successes , his mind stored with opulent gifts , his nature endowed with lofty virtues ; what an heir to train through the brief school of earth for due place in the ages that roll on for ever ! But this man has a parasite weed in each bed of a soul rich in flowers ; - weed and flowers intertwined , stem with stem - their fibres uniting even deep down to the root .
378737	378859	378890	378890	George	855	" Can you not conceive with what untiring vigilant care Heaven will seek to disentangle the flower from the weed ? - how let me drop inadequate metaphor - how Heaven will select for its warning chastisements that very error which the man has so blent with his virtues that he holds it a virtue itself ? - how , gradually , slowly , pertinaciously , it will gather this beautiful nature all to itself - insist on a sacrifice it will ask from no other ? To complete the true nature of poor William Losely , Heaven ordained the sacrifice of worldly repute ; to complete the true nature of Guy Darrell , God ordains him the sacrifice of PRIDE ! "
378879	378888	379003	379003	Darrell	512	" I have approached the favour I supplicate , "
378901	379001	379003	379003	Darrell	512	" Greater favour man can scarcely bestow upon his fellow . I entreat you to believe that I respect , and love , and honour you sufficiently to be for a while so lifted up into your friendship that I may claim the privilege , without which friendship is but a form ; - just as no freedom is more obnoxious than intrusion on confidence withheld , so no favour , I repeat , more precious than the confidence which a man of worth vouchsafes to him who invites it with no claim but the loyalty of his motives . "
379011	379063	379090	379090	He	512	" All human lives are as separate circles ; they may touch at one point in friendly approach , but , even where they touch , each rounds itself from off the other . With this hint I am contented to ask at what point in my circle you would touch ? "
379068	379089	379090	379090	He	512	" I thank you gratefully ; I accept your illustration . The point is touched ; I need no other . "
379110	379414	379422	379422	Darrell	512	" Yes , I accept your illustration ; I will even strengthen the force of the truth implied in it by a more homely illustration of my own . There are small skeleton abridgments of history which we give to children . In such a year a king was crowned - a battle was fought ; there was some great disaster , or some great triumph . Of the true progress and development of the nation whose record is thus epitomised - of the complicated causes which lead to these salient events - of the animated , varied multitudinous life which has been hurrying on from epoch to epoch , the abridgment tells nothing . It is so with the life of each individual man : the life as it stands before us is but a sterile epitome - hid from our sight the EMOTIONS which are the People of the Heart . In such a year occurred a visible something - a gain - a loss - a success - a disappointment ; the People of the Heart crowned or deposed a King . This is all we know ; and the most voluminous biography ever written must still be a meagre abridgment of all that really individualised and formed a man . I ask not your confidence in a single detail or fact in your existence which lies beyond my sight . Far from me so curious an insolence ; but I do ask you this : Reflecting on your past life as a whole , have not your chief sorrows had a common idiosyncrasy ? Have they not been strangely directed towards the frustration of some one single object - cherished by your earliest hopes , and , as if in defiance of fate , resolutely clung to even now ? "
379415	379420	379422	379422	Darrell	512	" It is true , "
379424	379434	379090	379090	He	512	" You do not offend me ; go on ! "
379435	379620	379422	379422	Darrell	512	" And have not these SORROWS , in frustrating your object , often assumed , too , a certain uniformity in the weapons they use , in the quarter they harass or invade , almost as if it were a strategic policy that guided them where they could most pain , or humble , or eject a FOE that they were ordered to storm ? Degrade you they could not ; such was not their mission . Heaven left you intact a kingliness of nature - a loftiness of spirit , unabased by assaults levelled not against yourself , but your pride ; your personal dignity , though singularly sensitive , though bitterly galled , stood proof . What might lower lesser men , lowered not you ; Heaven left you that dignity , for it belongs alike to your intellect and your virtues - but suffered it to be a source of your anguish . Why ? Because , not content with adorning your virtues , it was covering the fault against which were directed the sorrows . You frown - forgive me . "
379621	379669	379856	379857	stern PRIDE	1203	" You do not transgress , unless it be as a flatterer ! If I frowned , it was unconsciously - the sign of thought , not anger . Pause ! - my mind has left you for a moment ; it is looking into the past . "
379834	379839	379856	379857	stern PRIDE	1203	" I can bless ? "
379849	379853	379948	379948	he	10650	" but not pardon "
379942	379946	379948	379948	he	10650	" George Morley , "
379950	380384	380385	380386	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" I acknowledge much justice in the censure you have conveyed , with so artful a delicacy that , if it fail to reform , it can not displease , and leaves much to be seriously revolved in solitary self - commune . But though I may own that pride is not made for man , and that in the blindness of human judgment I may often have confounded pride with duty , and suffered for the mistake , yet that one prevailing object of my life , which with so startling a truth you say it has pleased Heaven to frustrate , I can not hold an error in itself . You have learned enough from your uncle , seen enough of me yourself , to know what that object has been . You are scholar enough to concede to me that it is no ignoble homage which either nations or persons render to the ancestral Dead - that homage is an instinct in all but vulgar and sordid natures . Has a man no ancestry of his own - rightly and justly , if himself of worth , he appropriates to his lineage all the heroes , and bards , and patriots of his fatherland ! A free citizen has ancestors in all the glorious chiefs that have adorned the State , on the sole condition that he shall revere their tombs and guard their memory as a son ! And thus , whenever they who speak trumpet - tongued to grand democracies would rouse some quailing generation to heroic deed or sacrifice , they appeal in the Name of Ancestors , and call upon the living to be worthy of the dead ! That which is so laudable - nay , so necessary a sentiment in the mass , can not be a fault that angers Heaven in the man . Like all high sentiments , it may compel harsh and rugged duties ; it may need the stern suppression of many a gentle impulse - of many a pleasing wish . But we must regard it in its merit and consistency as a whole . And if , my eloquent and subtle friend , all you have hitherto said be designed but to wind into pleas for the same cause that I have already decided against the advocate in my own heart which sides with Lionel 's generous love and yon fair girl 's ingenuous and touching grace , let us break up the court ; the judge has no choice but the law which imperiously governs his judgment . "
380389	380526	380528	380528	Darrell	512	" I have not hitherto presumed to apply to particular cases the general argument you so indulgently allow me to urge in favour of my theory , that in the world of the human heart , when closely examined , there is the same harmony of design as in the external universe ; that in Fault and in Sorrow are the axioms , and problems , and postulates of a SCIENCE . Bear with me a little longer if I still pursue the same course of reasoning . I shall not have the arrogance to argue a special instance - to say , ' This you should do , this you should not do . ' All I would ask is , leave to proffer a few more suggestions to your own large and candid experience . "
380543	380583	380584	380585	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" You have the true genius of the pulpit , and I concede to you its rights . I will listen with the wish to profit - the more susceptible of conviction because freed from the necessity to reply . "
380588	380856	380873	380874	the scholar	3036	" You vindicate the object which has been the main ambition of your life . You say ' not an ignoble object . ' Truly ! ignoble objects are not for you . The question is , are there not objects nobler , which should have attained higher value , and led to larger results in the soul which Providence assigned to you ; was not the proper place of the object you vindicate that of an auxiliary - a subordinate , rather than that of the all - directing , self - sufficing leader and autocrat of such various powers of mind ? I picture you to myself - a lone , bold - hearted boy - in this ancient hall , amidst these primitive landscapes , in which old associations are so little disturbed by the modern - in which the wild turf of waste lands , vanishing deep into mazes of solemn wood , lends the scene to dreams of gone days - brings Adventure and Knighthood , and all the poetical colours of Old , to unite the homage due to the ancestral dead with the future ambition of life ; - Image full of interest and of pathos - a friendless child of a race more beloved for its decay , looking dauntless on to poverty and toil , with that conviction of power which is born of collected purpose and earnest will ; and recording his secret vow that singlehanded he will undo the work of destroying ages , and restore his line to its place of honour in the land ! "
380868	380871	380873	380874	the scholar	3036	" Yes , "
380876	380907	380857	380857	George	855	" yes , for the child , for the youth , for the man in his first daring stride into the Action of Life , that object commands our respectful sympathies .
380908	381021	380873	380874	the scholar	3036	" But wait a few years . Has that object expanded ? Has it led on into objects embracing humanity ? Remains it alone and sterile in the bosom of successful genius ? Or is it prolific and fruitful of grander designs - of more widespreading uses ? Make genius successful , and all men have the right to say , ' Brother , help us ! ' What ! no other object still but to build up a house ! - to recover a line ! What was grand at one stage of an onward career , is narrow and small at another ! Ambition limited to the rise of a family !
381022	381090	381100	381101	GEORGE MORLEY	855	" Can our sympathies still hallow that ? No ! In Guy Darrell successful - that ambition was treason to earth ! Mankind was his family now ! THEREFORE Heaven thwarted the object which opposed its own ends in creating you ! THERFORE childless you stand on your desolate hearth ! THEREFORE , lo ! side by side - yon uncompleted pile - your own uncompleted life ! "
381104	381691	381874	381874	Darrell	512	" Has not that object stinted your very intellect ? Has it not , while baffled in its own centred aim - has it not robbed you of the glory which youth craved , and which manhood might have won ? Idolater to the creed of an Ancestor 's NAME , has your own name that hold on the grateful respect of the Future , which men ever give to that genius whose objects are knit with mankind ? Suddenly , in the zenith of life , amidst cheers , not of genuine renown , - cheers loud and brief as a mob 's hurrah - calamities , all of which I know not , nor conjecture , interrupt your career ; - and when your own life - long object is arrested , or rather when it is snatched from your eye , your genius renounces all uses . Fame , ever - during , was before you still , had your objects been those for which genius is given . You muse . Heaven permits these rude words to strike home ! Guy Darrell , it is not too late ! Heaven 's warnings are always in time . Reflect , with the one narrow object was fostered and fed the one master failing of Pride . To us as Christians , or as reasoners , it is not in this world that every duty is to find its special meed ; yet by that same mystical LAW which makes Science of Sorrow , rewards are but often the normal effect of duties sublimely fulfilled . Out of your pride and your one - cherished object , has there grown happiness ? Has the success which was not denied you achieved the link with posterity that your hand , if not fettered , would long since have forged ? Grant that Heaven says ' Stubborn child , yield at last to the warnings vouchsafed to thee by my love ! From a son so favoured and strong I exact the most difficult offering ! Thou hast sacrificed much , but for ends not prescribed in my law ; sacrifice now to me the thing thou most clingest to - Pride . I make the pang I demand purposely bitter . I twine round the offering I ask the fibres that bleed in relaxing . What to other men would be no duty , is duty to thee , because it entails a triumphant self - conquest , and pays to Humanity the arrears of just dues long neglected . ' Grant the hard sacrifice made ; I must think Heaven has ends for your joy even here , when it asks you to part with the cause of your sorrows ; - I must think that your evening of life may have sunshine denied to its noon . But with God are no bargains . A virtue , the most arduous because it must trample down what your life has exalted as virtue , is before you ; distasteful , austere , repellant . The most inviting arguments in its favour are , that it proffers no bribes ; men would acquit you in rejecting it ; judged by our world 's ordinary rule , men would be right in acquitting you . But if on reflection you say in your heart of hearts , ' This is a virtue , ' you will follow its noiseless path up to the smile of God ! "
381892	381963	381989	381989	Darrell	512	" I have now but to place before you this letter from my uncle to myself ; it enters into those details which it would have ill become me specially to discuss . Remember , I entreat you , in reading it , that it is written by your oldest friend - by a man who has no dull discrimination in the perplexities of life or the niceties of honour . "
381984	381987	381989	381989	Darrell	512	" Stay , "
381991	382028	382044	382044	his	512	" ' tis best to have but one interview - one conversation on the subject which has been just enforced on me ; and the letter may need a comment or a message to your uncle . "
382057	382089	382100	382100	George	855	" How is it that , with an experience of mankind which you will pardon me for assuming to be limited , you yet read so wondrously the complicated human heart ? "
382090	382098	382100	382100	George	855	" If I really have that gift , "
382102	382166	382187	382187	He	512	" I will answer your question by another : Is it through experience that we learn to read the human heart - or is it through sympathy ? If it be experience , what becomes of the Poet ? If the Poet be born , not made , is it not because he is born to sympathise with what he has never experienced ? "
382167	382176	382203	382203	himself	512	" I see ! There are born Preachers ! "
382205	382219	382276	382276	he	512	" Poor boy ! - but he is brave - he is young . "
382286	382325	382369	382369	he	855	" Let the young man live , and the old name die with Guy Darrell . Ay , ay ! see how the world sides with Youth ! What matters all else so that Youth have its toy ! "
382362	382368	382369	382369	he	855	" ' Serious apprehensions , ' "
382372	382390	382391	382391	He	512	" I owe ' consideration to such a friend . ' This man is without a heart ! "
382402	382423	382963	382964	the musician	2328	" Leave me this letter , George ; I will give an answer to that and to you before night . "
382952	382961	382963	382964	the musician	2328	" Not a crumb , you unprincipled beggars , "
382966	383062	383152	383152	Darrell	512	" You imagine that mankind are to have no other thought but that of supplying you with luxuries ! And if you were asked , in a competitive examination , to define ME , your benefactor , you would say : ' A thing very low in the scale of creation , without wings or even feathers , but which Providence endowed with a peculiar instinct for affording nutritious and palatable additions to the ordinary aliment of Swans ! ' Ay , you may grunt ; I wish I had you - in a pie ! "
383145	383150	383152	383152	Darrell	512	" Dear Fellow Hermit , "
383169	383254	383164	383164	his	512	" you find me just when I want you . I am as one whose eyes have been strained by a violent conflict of colours , and your quiet presence is like the relief of a return to green . I have news for you , Fairthorn . You , who know more of my secrets than any other man , shall be the first to learn a decision that must bind you and me more together - but not in these scenes , Dick .
383279	383279	383290	383290	Fairthorn	570	"
383280	383288	383290	383290	Fairthorn	570	" What do you mean , sir ? "
383292	383323	383164	383164	his	512	" My mind always misgives me when I hear you quoting Horace . Some reflection about the certainty of death , or other disagreeable subjects , is sure to follow ! "
383324	383348	383290	383290	Fairthorn	570	" Death ! No , Dick - not now . Marriage - bells and joy , Dick ! We shall have a wedding ! "
383349	383401	383411	383411	Darrell	512	" What ! You will marry at last ! And it must be that beautiful Caroline Lyndsay ! It must - it must ! You can never love another ! You know it , my dear , dear master . I shall see you , then , happy before I die . "
383402	383409	383411	383411	Darrell	512	" Tut , foolish old friend ! "
383430	383447	383290	383290	Fairthorn	570	" How often must I tell you that no Marriage - bells can ring for me ! "
383448	383557	383411	383411	Darrell	512	" But you have told me , too , that you went to Twickenham to steal a sight of her again ; and that it was the sight of her that made you resolve to we d no one else . And when I have railed against her for fickleness , have you not nearly frightened me out of my wits , as if no one might rail against her but yourself ? And now she is free - and did you not grant that she would not refuse your hand , and would be true and faithful henceforth ? And yet you insist on being - granite . "
383558	383571	383579	383579	Dick	570	" No , Dick , not granite ; I wish I were . "
383572	383577	383579	383579	Dick	570	" Granite and pride , "
383583	383603	383612	383612	Darrell	512	" If one chips a bit off the granite , one only breaks one 's spade against the pride . "
383604	383610	383612	383612	Darrell	512	" Pride - you too ! "
383619	383913	383411	383411	Darrell	512	" No , it is not pride now , whatever it might have been even yesterday . But I would rather be racked by all the tortures that pious inquisitors ever invented out of compassion for obstinate heretics , than condemn the woman I have so fatally loved to a penance the misery of which she can not foresee . She would accept me ? - certainly ! Why ! Because she thinks she owes me reparation - because she pities me . And my heart tells me that I might become cruel , and mean , and vindictive , if I were to live day by day with one who created in me , while my life was at noon , a love never known in its morn , and to feel that that love 's sole return was the pity vouchsafed to the nightfall of my age . No ; if she pitied , but did not love me , when , eighteen years ago , we parted under yonder beech - tree , I should be a dotard to dream that woman 's pity mellows into love as our locks become grey , and Youth turns our vows into ridicule . It is not pride that speaks here ; it is rather humility , Dick . But we must not now talk of old age and bygones . Youth and marriage - bells , Dick ! Know that , I have been for hours pondering how to reconcile with my old - fashioned notions dear Lionel 's happiness . We must think of the living as well as the dead , Dick . I have solved the problem . I am happy , and so shall the young folks be . "
383914	383927	383612	383612	Darrell	512	" You do n't mean to say that you will consent to - "
383928	384281	384292	384292	Dick	570	" Yes , to Lionel 's marriage with that beautiful girl , whose parentage we never will ask . Great men are their own ancestors ; why not sometimes fair women ? Enough - I consent ! I shall of course secure to my kinsman and his bride an ample fortune . Lionel will have time for his honeymoon before he departs for the wars . He will fight with good heart now , Dick . Young folks of the present day can not bear up against sorrow , as they were trained to do in mine . And that amiable lady who has so much pity for me has , of course , still more pity for a charming young couple for whose marriage she schemed , in order to give me a home , Dick . And rather than she should pine and fall ill , and - no matter ; all shall be settled as it should be for the happiness of the living . But something else must be settled ; we must think of the dead as well as the living ; and this name of Darrell shall be buried with me in the grave beside my father 's . Lionel Haughton will keep to his own name . Live the Haughtons ! Perish , but with no blot on their shield - perish the Darrells ! Why , what is that ? Tears , Dick ? Pooh ! - be a man ! And I want all your strength ; for you , too , must have a share in the sacrifice . What follows is not the dictate of pride , if I can read myself aright . No ; it is the final completion and surrender of the object on which so much of my life has been wasted - but a surrender that satisfies my crotchets of honour . At all events , if it be pride in disguise , it will demand no victim in others ; you and I may have a sharp pang - we must bear it , Dick . "
384282	384290	383612	383612	Darrell	512	" What on earth is coming now ? "
384296	384342	383612	383612	Darrell	512	" The due to the dead , Richara Fairthorn . This nook of fair England , in which I learned from the dead to love honour - this poor domain of Fawley - shall go in bequest to the College at which I was reared . "
384343	384346	383612	383612	Darrell	512	" Sir ! "
384347	384513	383612	383612	Darrell	512	" It will serve for a fellowship or two to honest , bravehearted young scholars . It will be thus , while English institutions may last , devoted to Learning and Honour . It may sustain for mankind some ambition more generous than mine , it appears , ever was - settled thus , not in mine , but my dear father 's name , like the Darrell Museum . These are my dues to the dead , Dick ! And the old house thus becomes useless . The new house was ever a folly . They must go down , both , as soon as the young folks are married ; - not a stone stand on stone ! The ploughshare shall pass over their sites ! And this task I order you to see done . I have not strength . You will then hasten to join me at Sorrento , that corner of earth on which Horace wished to breathe his last sigh .
384528	384528	383612	383612	Darrell	512	"
384529	384546	384578	384578	he	570	" Do n't , sir , do n't . Horace again ! It is too much . "
384590	384596	384607	384607	Darrell	512	" You must be joking . "
384597	384605	384761	384761	Dick	570	" Seriously and solemnly , Richara Fairthorn , "

385273	385307	385333	385333	he	512	" I shall go up - stairs to our sick friend for a few minutes ; may I find you here when I come back ? Your visit to him can follow mine . "
385327	385331	385390	385390	He	512	" Fair guest , "
385354	385389	385513	385513	He	512	" teach me some art by which in future rather to detain than to scare away the presence in which a duller age than mine could still recognise the charms that subdue the young . "
385425	385512	385561	385561	Waife	442	" You must not leave me for some days yet . I have written by this post to my kinsman , Lionel Haughton . I have refused to be his ambassador at a court in which , by all the laws of nations , he is bound to submit himself to his conqueror . I can not even hope that he may escape with his freedom . No ! chains for life ! Thrice happy , indeed , if that be the merciful sentence you inflict . "
385571	385577	385588	385588	he	512	" Is not Providence kind ? "

385590	385713	385561	385561	Waife	442	" be kind enough to tell Alban that you showed me his letter . Be kind enough also to write to Lady Montfort , and say that I gratefully acknowledge her wish to repair to me those losses which have left me to face age and the grave alone . Tell her that her old friend you remember , George , I knew her as a child sees in that wish the same sweet goodness of heart which soothed him when his son died and his daughter fled . Add that her wish is gratified . To that marriage in which she compassionately foresaw the best solace left to my bereaved and baffled existence - to that marriage I give my consent . "
385714	385728	385588	385588	he	512	" You do ! Oh , Mr. Darrell , how I honour you ! "
385729	385936	386072	386072	he	570	" Nay , I no more deserve honour for consenting than I should have deserved contempt if I had continued to refuse . To do what I deemed right is not more my wish now than it was twelve hours ago . To what so sudden a change of resolve , in one who changes resolves very rarely , may be due , whether to Lady Montfort , to Alban , or to that metaphysical skill with which you wound into my reason , and compelled me to review all its judgments , I do not attempt to determine ; yet I thought I had no option but the course I had taken . No ; it is fair to yourself to give you the chief credit ; you made me desire , you made me resolve , to find an option - I have found one . And now pay your visit where mine has been just paid . It will be three days , I suppose , before Lionel , having joined his new regiment at , can be here . And then it will be weeks yet , I believe , before his regiment sails ; and I 'm all for short courtships . "

Hailing , in her unutterable secret bliss , the musician who had so often joined her rambles in the days of unuttered secret sadness , she sprang towards him , with welcome and mirth in a face that would have lured Diogenes out of his tub . Fairthorn recoiled sidelong , growling forth , "

386468	386481	386498	386498	Darrell	512	" Sir Isaac is the wonderful dog you have heard me describe , "

386500	386505	386507	386507	Sophy	442	" Oh , no ! "
386509	386563	386565	386565	George	855	" he never hurts anything . He once found a wounded hare , and he brought it in his mouth to us so tenderly , and seemed so anxious that we should cure it , which grandfather did , and the hare would sometimes hurt him , but he never hurt the hare . "

And that boy Lionel , who was as proud as Guy Darrell himself when I saw him last prouder indeed - that he should be so ungrateful to his benefactor ! And , indeed , the day may come when he may turn round on you , or on the lame old gentleman , and say he has been disgraced . Should not wonder at all ! Young folks when they are sweet - hearting only talk about roses and angels , and such - like ; but when husbands and wives fall out , as they always do sooner or later , they do n't mince their words then , and they just take the sharpest thing that they can find at their tongue 's end . So you may depend on it , my dear Miss , that some day or other that young Haughton will say , ' that you lost him the old Manor - house and the old Darrell name , ' and have been his disgrace ; that 's the very word , Miss ; I have heard husbands and wives say it to each other over and over again .

The Colonel was engaged every moment for the next twelve hours . He had the Earl of Montfort , who was intractable and stupid beyond conception , to see and talk over ; Carr Vipont was hard at work on the materials for the new Cabinet - Alban was helping Carr Vipont . If the House of Vipont failed England at this moment , it would not be a CRISIS , but a CRASH ! The Colonel hoped to arrange an interview with Lady Montfort for a minute or two the next day . But perhaps she would excuse him from a journey to Twickenham , and drive into town to see him ; if not at home , he would leave word where he was to be found . "
392157	392162	392164	392164	he	628	" My dear lady , "
392166	392844	392877	392879	the good doctor	10837	" yours is a case in which physicians can be of very little use . There is something on the mind which my prescriptions fail to reach ; worry of some sort - decidedly worry . And unless you yourself can either cure that , or will make head against it , worry , my dear Lady Montfort , will end not in consumption - you are too finely formed to let worry eat holes in the lungs - no ; but in a confirmed aneurism of the heart , and the first sudden shock might then be immediately fatal . The heart is a noble organ - bears a great deal - but still its endurance has limits . Heart - complaints are more common than they were ; - over - education and over - civilisation , I suspect . Very young people are not so subject to them ; they have flurry , not worry - a very different thing . A good chronic silent grief of some years standing , that gets worried into acute inflammation at the age when feeling is no longer fancy , throws out a heart - disease which sometimes kills without warning , or sometimes , if the grief be removed , will rather prolong than shorten life , by inducing a prudent avoidance of worry in future . There is that worthy old gentleman who was taken so ill at Fawley , and about whom you were so anxious : in his case there had certainly been chronic grief ; then came acute worry , and the heart could not get through its duties . Fifty years ago doctors would have cried ' apoplexy ! ' - nowadays we know that the heart saves the head . Well , he was more easy in his mind the last time I saw him , and thanks to his temperance , and his constitutional dislike to self - indulgence in worry , he may jog on to eighty , in spite of the stethoscope ! Excess in the moral emotions gives heart - disease ; abuse of the physical powers , paralysis ; both more common than they were - the first for your gentle sex , the second for our rough one . Both , too , lie in wait for their victims at the entrance in middle life . I have a very fine case of paralysis now ; a man built up by nature to live to a hundred - never saw such a splendid formation - such bone and such muscle . I would have given Van Amburgh the two best of his lions , and my man would have done for all three in five minutes . All the worse for him , my dear lady - all the worse for him . His strength leads him on to abuse the main fountains of life , and out jumps avenging Paralysis and fells him to earth with a blow . ' Tis your Hercules that Paralysis loves ; she despises the weak invalid , who prudently shims all excess . And so , my dear lady , that assassin called Aneurism lies in wait for the hearts that abuse their own force of emotion ; sparing hearts that , less vital , are thrifty in waste and supply . But you are not listening to one ! And yet my patient may not be quite unknown to your ladyship ; for in happening to mention the other day , to the lady who attends to and nurses him , that I could not call this morning , as I had a visit to pay to Lady Montfort at Twickenham , she became very anxious about you , and wrote this note , which she begged me to give you . She seems very much attached to my patient - not his wife nor his sister . She interests me ; - capital nurse - cleverish woman too . Oh ! here is the note . "
392893	392935	392936	392936	Caroline	846	" No , my dear lady , I promised that I would see you read the note ; besides , I am the most curious of men , and dying to know a little more who and what is the writer . "
392945	393000	393028	393028	he	2598	" If Lady Montfort remembers Arabella Fossett , and will call at Clare Cottage , Vale of Health , Hampstead , at her ladyship 's earliest leisure , and ask for Mrs. Crane , some information , not perhaps important to Lady Montfort , but very important to Mr. Darrell , will be given . "
393021	393026	393037	393038	Lady Montfort	770	" What is it ? "
393030	393035	393011	393011	she	770	" The carriage immediately , "
393044	393109	393040	393041	the servant	2194	" Ah ! you are going to see the poor lady , Mrs. Crane , eh ? Well , it is a charming drive , and just what I should have recommended . Any exertion will do you good . Allow me ; why , your pulse is already fifty per cent . better . Pray what relation is Mrs. Crane to my patient ? "
393110	393130	393011	393011	she	770	" I really do n't know ; pray excuse me , my dear Dr. F - - - - . "
393131	393161	393488	393490	MRS . CRANE	482	" Certainly ; go while the day is fine . Wrap up ; - a close carriage , mind ; - and I will look in to - morrow . "
393493	393825	393458	393458	she	720	" You too are changed since I saw you last , - that was more than five years ago , but you are not less beautiful . You can still be loved ; - you would not scare away the man whom you might desire to save . Sorrow has its partialities . Do you know that I have a cause to be grateful to you , without any merit of your own . In a very dark moment of my life - only vindictive and evil passions crowding on me - your face came across my sight . Goodness seemed there so beautiful - and , in this face , Evil looked so haggard ! Do not interrupt me . I have but few minutes to spare you . Yes ; at the sight of that face , gentle recollections rose up . You had ever been kind to me ; and truthful , Caroline Lyndsay - truthful . Other thoughts came at the beam of that face , as other thoughts come when a strain of unexpected music reminds us of former days . I can not tell how , but from that moment a something more like womanhood , than I had known for years , entered into my heart . Within that same hour I was sorely tried galled to the quick of my soul . Had I not seen you before , I might have dreamed of nothing but a stern and dire revenge . And a purpose of revenge I did form . But it was not to destroy - it was to save ! I resolved that the man who laughed to scorn the idea of vows due to me - vows to bind life to life - should yet sooner or later be as firmly mine as if he had kept his troth ; that my troth at least should be kept to him , as if it had been uttered at the altar .
393826	393875	393982	393982	She	720	" Hush , did you hear a moan ? - No ! He lies yonder , Caroline Lyndsay - mine , indeed , till the grave us do part . These hands have closed over him , and he rests in their clasp , helpless as an infant . "
393985	394147	394159	394159	she	720	" I said to Guy Darrell that I would learn , if possible , whether the poor child whom I ill - used in my most wicked days , and whom you , it seems , have so benignly sheltered , was the daughter of Matilda - or , as he believed , of a yet more hateful mother . Long ago I had conceived a suspicion that there was some ground to doubt poor Jasper 's assertion , for I had chanced to see two letters addressed to him - one from that Gabrielle Desinarets whose influence over his life had been so baleful - in which she spoke of some guilty plunder with which she was coming to London , and invited him again to join his fortunes with her own . Oh , but the cold , bloodless villany of the tone ! - the ease with which crimes for a gibbet were treated as topics for wit ! "
394170	394769	394790	394793	an infirm old man	10860	" But in the letter were also allusions to Sophy , to another attempt on Darrell to be made by Gabrielle herself . Nothing very clear ; but a doubt did suggest itself - ' Is she writing to him about his own child ? ' The other letter was from the French nurse with whom Sophy had been placed as an infant . It related to inquiries in person , and a visit to her own house , which Mr. Darrell had recently made ; that letter also seemed to imply some deception , though but by a few dubious words . At that time the chief effect of the suspicion these letters caused was but to make me more bent on repairing to Sophy my cruelties to her childhood . What if I had been cruel to an infant who , after all , was not the daughter of that false , false Matilda Darrell ! I kept in my memory the French nurse 's address . I thought that when in France I might seek and question her . But I lived only for one absorbing end . Sophy was not then in danger ; and even my suspicions as to her birth died away . Pass on : - Guy Darrell ! Ah , Lady Montfort ! his life has been embittered like mine ; but he was man , and could bear it better . He has known , himself , the misery of broken faith , of betrayed affection , which he could pity so little when its blight fell on me ; but you have excuse for desertion - you yourself were deceived ; and I pardon him , for he pardoned Jasper , and we are fellow - sufferers . You weep ! Pardon my rudeness . I did not mean to pain you . Try and listen calmly - I must hurry on . On leaving Mr. Darrell I crossed to France . I saw the nurse ; I have ascertained the truth ; here are the proofs in this packet . I came back - I saw Jasper Losely . He was on the eve of seeking you , whom he had already so wronged - of claiming the child , or rather of extorting money for the renunciation of a claim to one whom you had adopted . I told him how vainly he had hitherto sought to fly from me . One by one I recited the guilty schemes in which I had baffled his purpose - all the dangers from which I had rescued his life . I commanded him to forbear the project he had then commenced . I told him I would frustrate that project as I had frustrated others . Alas , alas ! why is this tongue so harsh ? - why does this face so belie the idea of human kindness ? I did but enrage and madden him ; he felt but the reckless impulse to destroy the life that then stood between himself and the objects to which he had pledged his own self - destruction . I thought I should die by his hand . I did not quail . Ah ! the ghastly change that came over his face - the one glance of amaze and superstitious horror ; his arm obeyed him not ; his strength , his limbs , forsook him ; he fell at my feet - one side of him stricken dead ! Hist ! that is his voice - pardon me ! "
394802	394827	394841	394843	the grim woman	5365	" I want to turn ; help me . Why am I left alone ? It is cruel to leave me so - cruel ! "
394848	394875	394979	394979	she	10862	" You gave me leave , Jasper dear . You said it would be a relief to you to have her pardon as well as theirs . "
394876	394880	394979	394979	she	10862	" Whose pardon ? "
394886	394895	394979	394979	she	10862	" Caroline Lyndsay 's - Lady Montfort 's . "
394896	394944	394979	394979	she	10862	" Nonsense ! What did I ever do against her ? Oh - ah ! I remember now . Do n't let me have it over again . Yes - she pardons me , I suppose ! Get me my broth , and do n't be long ! "
394993	395019	394979	394979	she	10862	" You heard - he misses me ! He ca n't bear me out of his sight now - me , me ! You heard ! "
395037	395057	395073	395073	She	10862	" Yes , I heard ! I must not keep you ; but let me help while I stay . "
395091	395116	395399	395399	Jasper	721	" Come in - say you forgive him ! Oh , you need not fear him ; a babe could not fear him now ! "
395371	395398	395605	395605	Jasper	721	" And the pitcher was broken at the fountain ; and the wheel was broken at the cistern ; vanity of vanities , saith the Preacher . "
395595	395603	395646	395646	He	2645	" I 'm a very poor creature , "
395611	395645	395666	395666	he	2645	" I ca n't rise - I ca n't move without help . Very strange supernatural ! She always said that if I raised my hand against her , it would fall palsied ! "
395659	395665	395686	395687	LADY MONTFORT	770	" She is a witch ! "
395690	395734	395793	395793	he	2645	" She is rather your good ministering spirit . Do not be unkind to her . Over her you have more power now than you had when you were well and strong . She lives but to serve you ; command her gently . "
395784	395792	395793	395793	he	2645	" I have been a sad dog , "
395806	395923	395768	395768	he	2645	" a very sad dog - in short , a villain ! But all ladies are indulgent to villains in fact , prefer them ! Never knew a lady who could endure ' a good young man ' - never ! So I am sure you will forgive me , miss - ma'am . Who is this lady ? When it comes to forgiveness , there are so many of them ! Oh , I remember now - your ladyship will forgive me - ' tis all down in black and white what I 've done - Belles has it . You see this hand - I can write with this hand - this is not paralysed .
395924	396014	395793	395793	he	2645	" This is not the hand I tried to raise against her . But basta , basta ! where was I ? My poor head ! I know what it is to have a head now ! - ache , ache ! - boom , boom - weight , weight - heavy as a church bell - hollow as a church bell - noisy as a church bell ! Brandy ! give me brandy , you witch ! - I mean Bella , good Bella , give me brandy ! "
396015	396080	395768	395768	he	2645	" Not yet , Jasper dear . You are to have it every third hour ; it is not time yet , dearest ; you must attend to the doctor , and try to get well and recover your strength . You remember I told you how kind Lady Montfort had been to your father , and you wished to see and thank her . "
396081	396126	396133	396134	Mrs. Crane	482	" My father - my poor , poor father ! You 've been kind to him ! Bless you , bless you ! And you will see him ? I want his pardon before I die . Do n't forget , and - and - "
396127	396131	395768	395768	he	2645	" Poor Sophy ! "
396136	396179	395768	395768	he	2645	" Ah yes ! But she 's well off now , you tell me . I ca n't think I have injured her . And really girls and women are intended to be a little useful to one . Basta , basta . "
396181	396185	395768	395768	he	2645	" Mr. Darrell - "
396186	396223	395768	395768	he	2645	" Yes , yes , yes ! I forgive him , or he forgives me ; settle it as you like . But my father 's pardon , Lady Montfort , you will get me that ! "
396224	396231	396261	396261	he	10875	" I will , I will . "
396252	396260	396261	396261	he	10875	" Throw a handkerchief over my face , "
396265	396279	396306	396306	Arabella	1039	" and leave me ; but be in call ; I feel sleepy . "
396295	396304	396306	396306	Arabella	1039	" You will bring his father to him ? "
396317	396444	396306	396306	Arabella	1039	" In this packet is Jasper 's confession of the robbery for which that poor old man suffered . I never knew of that before . But you see how mild he is now ! - how his heart is changed ; it is indeed changed more than he shows ; only you have seen him at the worst - his mind wanders a little to - day ; it does sometimes . I have a favour to ask of you . I once heard a preacher , not many months ago ; he affected me as no preacher ever did before . I was told that he was Colonel Morley 's nephew . Will you ask Colonel Morley to persuade him to come to Jasper ? "
396445	396476	396306	396306	Arabella	1039	" My cousin , George Morley ! He shall come , I promise you ; so shall your poor patient 's forgiving father . Is there more I can do ? "
396477	396734	396911	396911	Arabella	1039	" No . Explain to Mr. Darrell the reason why I have so long delayed sending to him the communication which he will find in the packet I have given to you , and which you will first open , reading the contents yourself - a part of them , at least , in Jasper 's attestation of his stratagem to break off your marriage with Mr. Darrell , may yet be of some value to you - you had better also show the papers to Colonel Morley - he may complete the task . I had meant , on returning to England , or before seeing Mr. Darrell , to make the inquiries which you will see are still necessary . But then came this terrible affliction ! I have been able to think of nothing else but Jasper ; - terrible to quit the house which contains him for an hour ; only , when Dr. F. told me that he was attending you , that you were ill and suffering , I resolved to add to this packet Jasper 's own confession . Ah , and he gave it so readily , and went yesterday through the fatigue of writing with such good heart . I tell you that there is a change within him - there is there is . Well , well - I resolved to give you the packet to transmit to Mr. Darrell , for somehow or other I connected your illness with your visit to him at Fawley ! "
396735	396742	396306	396306	Arabella	1039	" My visit to Mr. Darrell ! "
396743	396783	396791	396791	Caroline	846	" Jasper saw you as your carriage drove from the park gate , not very many days since . Ah , you change colour ! You have wronged that man ; repair the wrong ; you have the power ! "
396784	396789	396791	396791	Caroline	846	" Alas ! no , "
396793	396800	396306	396306	Arabella	1039	" I have not the power . "
396801	396820	396856	396856	she	5365	" Pooh ! - he loves you still . You are not one of those whom men forget . "
396846	396855	396856	396856	she	5365	" Ah ! Pride - pride in both , "
396859	396891	396901	396901	Caroline	846	" I understand - I dare not blame him here . But you - you were the injurer ; you have no right to pride ; you will see him again . "
396892	396899	396939	396939	Arabella	1039	" No - never - never ! "
396926	396937	396856	396856	she	5365	" You will see him again , I tell you ; "
396947	396957	396856	396856	she	5365	" Stay ; do you think HE will die ? "
396958	396965	396856	396856	she	5365	" Good heavens ! Mr. Darrell ? "
396966	396974	396856	396856	she	5365	" No , no - Jasper Losely ! "
396975	396986	396856	396856	she	5365	" I hope not . What does Dr. F. say ? "
396987	397058	397087	397087	Carr	897	" He will not tell me . But it is not the paralysis alone ; he might recover from that - so young still . There are other symptoms ; that dreadful habit of stimulants ! He sinks if he has them not - they hasten death if he has . But - but - but - HE IS MINE , AND MINE ONLY , TO THE GRAVE - NOW ! "
397101	397319	397357	397357	he	628	" My dear Lady Montfort ! - not seen you for an age ! What times we live in ! How suddenly THE CRISIS has come upon us ! Sad loss in poor dear Montfort ; no wonder you mourn for him ! Had his failings , true - who is not mortal ? - but always voted right ; always to be relied on in times of CRISIS ! But this crotchety fellow , who has so unluckily , for all but himself , walked into that property , is the loosest fish ! And what is a House divided against itself ? Never was the Constitution in such peril ! - I say it deliberately ! - and here is the Head of the Viponts humming and haaing , and asking whether Guy Darrell will join the Cabinet . And if Guy Darrell will not , we have no more chance of the Montfort interest than if we were Peep - o'-day Boys . But excuse me ; I must be off ; every moment is precious in times of CRISIS . Think , if we ca n't form a Cabinet by to - morrow night - only think what may happen ; the other fellows will come in , and then - THE DELUGE ! "
397370	397973	398158	398159	the Colonel	13877	" Only think - I knew it would be so when the moment came ; all depends upon Guy Darrell ; Montfort , who seems always in a fright lest a newspaper should fall on his head and crush him , says that if Darrell , whom he chooses to favour just because the newspapers do , declines to join , the newspapers will say the CRISIS is a job ! Fancy ! - a job - the CRISIS ! Lord Mowbray de l'Arco and Sir Josiah Snodge , who are both necessary to a united government , but who unluckily detest each other , refuse to sit in the same Cabinet , unless Darrell sit between - to save them , I suppose , from the fate of the cats of Kilkenny . Sir John Cautly , our crack county member , declares that if Darrell does not come in , ' tis because the CRISIS is going too far ! Harry Bold , our most popular speaker , says , if Darrell stay out , ' tis a sign that the CRISIS is a retrograde movement ! In short , without Darrell the CRISIS will be a failure , and the House of Vipont smashed - Lady Montfort - smashed ! I sent a telegram oh , that I should live to see such a word introduced into the English language ! - but , as Carr says , what times these are ! to Fawley this morning , entreating Guy to come up to town at once . He answers by a line from Horace , which means , ' that he will see me shot first . ' I must go down to him ; only waiting to know the result of certain negotiations as to measures . I have but one hope . There is a measure which Darrell always privately advocated - which he thoroughly understands - which , placed in his hands , would be triumphantly carried ; one of those measures , Lady Montfort , which , if defective , shipwreck a government ; if framed as Guy Darrell could frame it , immortalise the minister who concocts and carries them . This is all that Darrell needs to complete his fame and career . This is at length an occasion to secure a durable name in the history of his country ; let him reject it , and I shall tell him frankly that his life has been but a brilliant failure . Since he has not a seat in Parliament , and usage requires the actual possession of that qualification for a seat in the Cabinet , we must lose his voice in the Commons . But we can arrange that ; for if Darrell will but join the government , and go - to the Lords , Sir Josiah Snodge , who has a great deal of voice and a great deal of jealousy , will join too - head the Vipont interest in the Commons - and speak to the country - speak every night - and all night , too , if required . Yes ; Darrell must take the peerage - devote himself for a year or two to this great measure - to the consolidation of his fame - to the redemption of the House of Vipont - and to the Salvation of the Empire ; and then , if he please , ' solve senescentem ' - that is , he may retire from harness , and browse upon laurels for the rest of his days ! "
398150	398156	398158	398159	the Colonel	13877	" A very good riddance , "
398163	398252	398319	398319	his	13877	" Great relief to Darrell , and to every one else whom that monster tormented and preyed on ; and with his life will vanish the only remaining obstacle in righting poor Willy 's good name . I hope to live to collect , from all parts of the country , Willy 's old friends and give them a supper , at which I suppose I must not get drunk ; though I should rather like it , than not ! But I interrupt you ! go on . "
398322	398371	398469	398469	she	770	" Well , I have half an hour yet to spare in discussing these matters with you - may I order your coachman to drive round the Regent 's Park ? - better than keeping it thus at my door , with four old maids for opposite neighbours . "
398454	398468	398469	398469	she	770	" Oh , not that paper - you are not to read that , "
398480	398819	399045	399046	Lady Montfort	770	" Too late , my dear cousin . I have read it . All is now clear . Lionel was right ; and I was right too , in my convictions , though Darrell put so coolly aside my questions when I was last at Fawley . I am justified now in all the pains I took to secure Lionel 's marriage - in the cunning cruelty of my letter to George ! Know , Lady Montfort , that if Lionel had sacrificed his happiness to respect for Guy 's ancestor - worship , Guy Darrell would have held himself bound in honour never to marry again . He told me so - told me he should be a cheat if he took any step to rob one from whom he had exacted such an offering - of the name , and the heritage , for which the offering had been made . And I then resolved that County Guy should not thus irrevocably shut the door on his own happiness ! Lady Montfort , you know that this man loves you - as , verily , I believe , never other man in our cold century loved woman ; - through desertion - through change - amidst grief - amidst resentment - despite pride ; - dead to all other love - shrinking from all other ties - on , constant on - carrying in the depth of his soul to the verge of age , secret and locked up , the hopeless passion of his manhood . Do you not see that it is through you , and you alone , that Guy Darrell has for seventeen years been lost to the country he was intended to serve and to adorn ? Do you not feel that if he now reject this last opportunity to redeem years so wasted , and achieve a fame that may indeed link his Ancestral Name to the honours of Posterity , you , and you alone , are the cause ? "
398820	398831	398469	398469	she	770	" Alas - alas - but what can I do ? "
398832	398888	398899	398900	Lady Montfort	770	" Do ! - ay , true . The poor fellow is old now ; you can not care for him ! - you still young , and so unluckily beautiful ! - you , for whom young princes might vie . True ; you can have no feeling for Guy Darrell , except pity ! "
398889	398897	398929	398929	his	4961	" Pity ! I hate the word ! "
398937	398941	398469	398469	she	770	" See him ! "
398942	398963	398929	398929	his	4961	" But I have seen him . You remember I went to plead for Lionel and Sophy - in vain ! "
398964	399044	398469	398469	she	770	" Not in vain . George writes me word that he has informed you of Darrell 's consent to their marriage . And I am much mistaken if his greatest consolation in the pang that consent must have cost him be not the thought that it relieves you from the sorrow and remorse his refusal had occasioned to you . Ah ! there is but one person who can restore Darrell to the world - and that is yourself ! "
399052	399073	399216	399217	Lady Montfort	770	" If I had but an excuse - with dignity - with self - respect - to - to - ! '
399074	399214	399230	399231	the Colonel	13877	" An excuse ! You have an absolute necessity to communicate with Darrell . You have to give him these documents - to explain how you came by them . Sophy is with him ; you are bound to see her on a subject of such vital importance to herself . Scruples of prudery ! You , Caroline Lyndsay , the friend of his daughter - you whose childhood was reared in his very house - you whose mother owed to him such obligations - you to scruple in being the first to acquaint him with information affecting him so nearly ! And why , forsooth ? Because , ages ago , your hand was , it seems , engaged to him , and you were deceived by false appearances , like a silly young girl as you were . "
399225	399228	399230	399231	the Colonel	13877	" Well , "
399237	399286	399296	399296	Caroline	893	" I will grant that those former ties ca n't be renewed now . The man now is as old as the hills , and you had no right to expect that he would have suffered so much at being very naturally jilted for a handsome young Marquess . "
399287	399294	399300	399301	The Colonel	13877	" Cease , sir , cease , "
399305	399743	399777	399778	The Colonel	13877	" I see now that such nuptials are out of the question . But has the world come to such a pass that one can never at any age have a friend in a lady unless she marry him ? Scruple to accompany me - me your cousin - me your nearest surviving relation - in order to take back the young lady you have virtually adopted ! - scruple to trust yourself for half an hour to that tumbledown old Fawley ! Are you afraid that the gossips will say you , the Marchioness of Montfort , are running after a gloomy old widower , and scheming to be mistress of a mansion more like a ghosttrap than a residence for civilised beings ? Or are you afraid that Guy Darrell will be fool and fop enough to think you are come to force on him your hand ? Pooh , pooh ! Such scruples would be in place if you were a portionless forward girl , or if he were a conceited young puppy , or even a suspicious old roue . But Guy Darrell - a man of his station , his character , his years ! And you , cousin Caroline , what are you ? Surely , lifted above all such pitiful crotchets by a rank amongst the loftiest gentlewomen of England ; ample fortune , a beauty that in itself is rank and wealth ; and , above all , a character that has passed with such venerated purity through an ordeal in which every eye seeks a spot , every ear invites a scandal . But as you will . All I say is , that Darrell 's future may be in your hands ; that after to - morrow , the occasion to give at least noble occupation and lasting renown to a mind that is devouring itself and stifling its genius , may be irrevocably lost ; and that I do believe , if you said to - morrow to Guy Daxrell , ' You refused to hear me when I pleaded for what you thought a disgrace to your name , and yet even that you at last conceded to the voice of affection as if of duty - now hear me when I plead by the side of your oldest friend on behalf of your honour , and in the name of your forefathers , ' - if You say THAT , he is won to his country . You will have repaired a wrong ; and , pray , will you have compromised your dignity ? "
399785	399990	400046	400047	Mrs. Morley	1192	" Nothing so natural ; you are the widow of the Head of the House of Vipont . You are , or ought to be , deeply interested in its fate . An awful CRISIS , long expected , has occurred . The House trembles . A connection of that House can render it an invaluable service ; that connection is the man at whose hearth your childhood was reared ; and you go with me - me , who am known to be moving heaven and earth for every vote that the House can secure , to canvass this wavering connection for his support and assistance . Nothing , I say , so natural ; and yet you scruple to serve the House of Vipont - to save your country ! You may well be agitated . I leave you to your own reflections . My time runs short ; I will get out here . Trust me with these documents . I will see to the rest of this long painful subject . I will send a special report to you this evening , and you will reply by a single line to the prayer I have ventured to address to you . "
400019	400027	400255	400255	Lionel	419	" WHAT WILL HE DO WITH IT ? "
400268	400294	400421	400421	he	512	" I must leave you , sir ; God bless you ! All is over . I was the blindest fool - she refuses me . "
400295	400306	400320	400320	Lionel	419	" Refuses you ! - impossible ! For what reason ? "
400307	400318	400421	400421	he	512	" She can not love me well enough to marry , "
400352	400396	400412	400412	Darrell	512	" Likes me as a friend , a brother , and so forth , but - nothing more . All a mistake , sir - all , except your marvellous kindness to me - to her - for which Heaven ever bless you . "
400397	400410	400441	400441	He	512	" Yes , all a mistake of your own , foolish boy , "
400448	400491	400676	400676	she	442	" Tell this dull kinsman of mine that ' faint heart never won fair lady . ' You do not mean seriously , deliberately to reject a heart that will never be faint with a meaner fear than that of losing you ? "
400550	400555	400676	400676	she	442	" Sensible of the honour "
400557	400559	400676	400676	she	442	" Grateful "
400561	400567	400571	400571	Darrell	512	" Some one more worthy , "
400577	400627	400633	400633	Lionel	419	" My question , young lady , is solemn ; it involves the destiny of two lives . Do you mean to say that you do not love Lionel Haughton well enough to give him your hand , and return the true faith which is pledged with his own ? "
400628	400631	400633	400633	Lionel	419	" Yes , "
400644	400658	400665	400665	her	442	" yes , that is it . O Sophy - Ay or No ? "
400659	400662	400676	400676	she	442	" No ! "
400691	400713	400785	400785	Darrell	512	" Grandfather , grandfather ! - home , home ; let us go home at once , or I shall die ! "
400779	400783	400785	400785	Darrell	512	" Noble child , "
400787	400813	400950	400950	She	442	" I think I see into her heart . If so , poor Lionel , indeed ! My pride has yielded , hers never will ! "
400954	401041	401146	401146	Waife	442	" O grandfather , let us ever henceforth be all in all to each other . You are not ashamed of me - I am so proud of you . But there are others akin to me , grandfather , whom we will not mention ; and you would be ashamed of me if I brought disgrace on one who would confide to me his name , his honour ; and should I be as proud of you , if you asked me to do it ? "
401160	401167	401238	401239	the man	1450	" How dare you , sir , "
401231	401236	401238	401239	the man	1450	" How dare I ? "
401249	401354	401420	401424	a tall , thin personage	10930	" How dare I kiss my own niece ? - my own sister 's orphan child ? Venerable Bandit , I have a much better right than you have . Oh , my dear injured Sophy , to think that I was ashamed of your poor cotton print - to think that to your pretty face I have been owing fame and fortune - and you , you wandering over the world - child of the sister of whose beauty I was so proud - of her for whom , alas , in vain ! I painted Watteaus and Greuzes upon screens and fans ! "
401399	401414	401446	401446	Waife	442	" But where is my old friend William Losely ? - where is Willy ? "
401440	401444	401446	401446	Waife	442	" Alban Morley ! "
401448	401455	401538	401539	the Colonel	13877	" you are but little changed ! "
401522	401536	401562	401563	Fairthorn morbific	1223	" ' Eheu , fugaces , Postume , Postume , Labuntur anni , ' "
401565	401645	401538	401539	the Colonel	13877	" Years slide away , Willy , mutely as birds skim through air ; but when friend meets with friend after absence , each sees the print of their crows ' feet on the face of the other . But we are not too old yet , Willy , for many a meet at the fireside ! Nothing else in our studs , we can still mount our hobbies ; and thoroughbred hobbies contrive to be in at the death .
401646	401710	401717	401717	Fairthorn	1223	" But you are waiting to learn by what title and name this stranger lays claim to so peerless a niece . Know then Ah , here comes Darrell . Guy Darrell , in this young lady you will welcome the grandchild of Sidney Branthwaite , our old Eton school friend , a gentleman of as good blood as any in the land ! "
401711	401715	401717	401717	Fairthorn	1223	" None better , "
401727	401751	401763	401764	the Colonel	13877	" there 's a note on the Branthwaite genealogy , sir , in your father 's great work upon ' Monumental Brasses . ' "
401752	401761	401763	401764	the Colonel	13877	" Permit me to conclude , Mr. Fairthorn , "
401766	401850	401856	401856	Lionel	419	" Monumental Brasses are painful subjects . Yes , Darrell , - yes , Lionel ; this fair creature , whom Lady Montfort might well desire to adopt , is the daughter of Arthur Branthwaite , by marriage with the sister of Frank Vance , whose name I shrewdly suspect nations will prize , and whose works princes will hoard , when many a long genealogy , all blazoned in azure and or , will have left not a scrap for the moths . "
401851	401854	401856	401856	Lionel	419	" Ah ! "
401858	401915	401967	401967	Waife	442	" was it not I , Sophy , who taught you to love your father 's genius ! Do you not remember how , as we bent over his volume , it seemed to translate to us our own feelings ? - to draw us nearer together ? He was speaking to us from his grave . "
401942	401965	401976	401976	Alban	628	" Is it so ? Is it certain ? Is there no doubt that she is the child of these honoured parents ? "
401971	401974	401976	401976	Alban	628	" None , "
401978	401992	402029	402029	he	1741	" we bring with us proofs that will clear up all my story . "
402016	402027	402045	402045	Sophy	442	" You are mine for a moment yet , Sophy , "
402031	402043	401997	401997	his	1741	" Yours as ever - more fondly , gratefully than ever , "
402047	402070	402079	402079	Vance	425	" There is but one man to whom I can willingly yield you . Son of Charles Haughton , take my treasure . "
402071	402077	402079	402079	Vance	425	" I consent to that , "
402081	402112	402118	402118	Lionel	419	" though I am put aside like a Remorseless Baron . And , Lionello mio , if Frank Vance is a miser , so much the better for his niece . "
402113	402116	401997	401997	his	1741	" But , "
402120	402218	402225	402225	Alban	628	" Oh , falter not . Look into those eyes ; read that blush now . She looks coy , not reluctant . She bends before him - adorned as for love , by all her native graces . Air seems brightened by her bloom . No more the Outlaw - Child of Ignominy and Fraud , but the Starry Daughter of POETRY AND ART ! Lo , where they glide away under the leafless , melancholy trees . Leafless and melancholy ! No ! Verdure and blossom and the smile of spring are upon every bough ! "
402219	402223	402225	402225	Alban	628	" I suppose , "
402227	402303	402305	402305	Alban	628	" it will not now break Lionel 's heart to learn that not an hour before I left London , I heard from a friend at the Horse Guards that it has been resolved to substitute the regiment for Lionel 's ; and it will be for some time yet , I suspect , that he must submit to be in gloriously happy . Come this way , George , a word in your ear . "
402325	402437	402446	402446	George	855	" Not a word to - day on these mournful topics , to poor Willy . To - day let nothing add to his pain to have lost a grandchild , or dim his consolation in the happiness and security his Sophy gains in that loss . But to - morrow you will go and see the stricken - down sinner , and prepare the father for the worst . I made a point of seeing Dr. F. last night . He gives Jasper but a few weeks . He compares him to a mountain , not merely shattered by an earthquake , but burned out by its own inward fires . "
402438	402444	402446	402446	George	855	" A few weeks only , "
402448	402504	402511	402515	the Man of the World	4961	" Well , Time , that seems everything to man , has not even an existence in the sight of God . To that old man I owe the power of speech to argue , to exhort , and to comfort ; - he was training me to kneel by the deathbed of his son ! "
402505	402509	402511	402515	the Man of the World	4961	" You believe , "
402517	402539	402546	402547	the Preacher	5548	" in the efficacy of a deathbed repentance , when a sinner has sinned till the power of sinning be gone ? "
402540	402544	402546	402547	the Preacher	5548	" I believe , "
402549	402580	403653	403653	Jasper	721	" that in health there is nothing so unsafe as trust in a deathbed repentance ; I believe that on the deathbed , it can not be unsafe to repent ! "
403482	403652	403988	403988	Jasper	721	" There is what , if well - managed , may retain your hold on a rich father - in - law when all else has failed . You have but to say that this infant is his grandchild ; the nurse we can easily bribe , or persuade to confirm the tale . I , whom he already knows as that respectable baroness , your Matilda 's friend , can give to the story some probable touches . The lone childless man must rejoice to think that a tie is left to him . The infant is exquisitely pretty ; her face will plead for her . His heart will favour the idea too much to make him very rigorous in his investigations . Take the infant . Doubtless in your own country you can find some one to rear it at little or no expense , until the time come for appeal to your father - in - law when no other claim on his purse remains . "
404002	404010	404392	404392	he	512	" but she is not your grandchild ! "
404385	404390	404427	404427	he	512	" It is well , "
404421	404426	404463	404463	he	512	" It is well , "
404457	404462	404463	404463	he	512	" it is well , "
404470	404622	404629	404629	Alban	628	" Poor human nature ! Alban , can you conceive it ? I , who once so dreaded that that poor child should prove to be of my blood , now , in knowing that she is not , feel a void , a loss ! To Lionel I am so distant a kinsman ! - to his wife , to his children , what can I be ? A rich old man ; the sooner he is in his grave the better . A few tears , and then the will ! But , as your nephew says , ' This life is but a school ; ' the new - comer in the last form thinks the head - boy just leaving so old ! And to us , looking back , it seems but the same yesterday whether we were the last comer or the head - boy . "
404623	404627	404629	404629	Alban	628	" I thought , "
404633	404677	404734	404734	Ulysses	669	" that , for a short time at least , I had done with ' painful subjects . ' You revel in them ! County Guy , you have not left school yet ; leave it with credit ; win the best prize . "
404754	404758	404874	404874	Darrell	512	" the Measure , "
404865	404872	404874	404874	Darrell	512	" No , my dear Alban , "
404876	405031	405150	405150	he	628	" I can not summon up sufficient youth and freshness of spirit to re - enter the turbulent arena I have left . Ah ! look yonder where Lionel and Sophy move ! Give me , I do not say Lionel 's years , but Lionel 's wealth of hope , and I might still have a wish for fame and a voice for England ; but it is a subtle truth , that when a man misses a home , a link between his country and himself is gone . Vulgar ambition may exist - the selfish desire of power ; they were never very strong in me , and now less strong than the desire of rest ; but that beautiful , genial , glorious union of all the affections of social citizen , which begins at the hearth and widens round the land , is not for the hermit 's cell . "
405168	405196	405197	405197	Darrell	512	" I have a message to you from Lady Montfort . Restless man , do come nearer , and stand still . I am tired to death . "
405220	405227	405150	405150	he	628	" A message from Lady Montfort ! "
405228	405514	405529	405529	Darrell	512	" Yes . I should have told you , by - the - by , that it was she who , being a woman , of course succeeded where I , being a man , despite incredible pains and trouble , signally failed , discovered Arabella Fossett , alias Crane , and obtained from her the documents which free your life forever from a haunting and torturing fear . I urged her to accompany me hither , and place the documents herself in your hand . She refused ; you were not worth so much trouble , my dear Guy . I requested her at least to suffer me to show to you a paper containing Jasper Losely 's confession of a conspiracy to poison her mind against you some years ago - a conspiracy so villianously ingenious that it would have completely exonerated any delicate and proud young girl from the charge of fickleness in yielding to an impulse of pique and despair . But Lady Montfort did not wish to be exonerated ; your good opinion has ceased to be of the slightest value to her . But to come to the point . She bade me tell you that , if you persist in sheltering yourself in a hermit 's cell from the fear of meeting her - if she be so dangerous to your peace - you may dismiss such absurd apprehension . She is going abroad , and between you and me , my dear fellow , I have not a doubt that she will marry again before six months are out . I spoke of your sufferings ; she told me she had not the smallest compassion for them . "
405515	405527	405150	405150	he	628	" Alban Morley , you presumed to talk thus of me ? "
405535	405645	405150	405150	he	628	" Strike , but hear me . It is true you would not own , when I was last at Fawley , that she was the cause of your secluded life , of your blighted career ; but I knew better . However , let me go on before you strangle me . Lady Montfort 's former feelings of friendship for you are evidently quite changed ; and she charged me to add , that she really hoped that you would exert your good sense and pride of which Heaven knows you have plenty to eradicate an absurd and romantic sentiment , so displeasing to her , and so - "
405646	405694	406183	406183	Darrell	512	" It is false ! it is false ! What have I done to you , Colonel Morley , that you should slander me thus ? I send you messages of taunt and insult , Mr. Darrell ! You can not believe it - you can not ! "
406176	406181	406183	406183	Darrell	512	" Again - again , "
406187	406331	406332	406332	She	11094	" The same music ! the same air ! and this the same place on which we two stood together when I first dared to say , ' I love ! ' Look ! we are under the very tree ! Look ! there is the date I carved on the bark when you were gone , but had left Hope behind . Ah , Caroline , why can I not now resign myself to age ? Why is youth , while I speak , rushing back into my heart , into my soul ? Why can not I say , ' Gratefully I accept your tender friendship ; let the past be forgotten ; through what rests to me of the future while on earth , be to me as a child . I can not - I can not ! Go ! "
406342	406363	406368	406368	he	11095	" Even that , Darrell , - even that ; something in your life - let me be something still ! "
406364	406367	406368	406368	he	11095	" Ah , "
406374	406456	406332	406332	She	11094	" you deceive me no longer now ! You own that , when here we stood last and exchanged our troth , you in the blossom , and I in the prime , of life - you own that it was no woman 's love , deaf to all calumny , proof to all craft that could wrong the absent ; no woman 's love , warm as the heart , undying as the soul , that you pledged me then ? "
406457	406471	406478	406478	he	11095	" Darrell , it was not - though then I thought it was . "
406472	406477	406650	406650	woman	11452	" Ay , ay , "
406654	406654	406771	406771	She	11096	"
406655	406662	406650	406650	woman	11452	" Darrell , I was not . "
406663	406696	406771	406771	She	11096	" You own it , and you suffer me to see you again ! Trifler and cruel one , is it but to enjoy the sense of your undiminished , unalterable power ? "
406697	406770	406830	406830	Darrell	512	" Alas , Darrell ! alas ! why am I here ? - why so yearning , yet so afraid to come ? Why did my heart fail when these trees rose in sight against the sky ? - why , why - why was it drawn hither by the spell I could not resist ? Alas , Darrell , alas ! I am a woman now - and - and this - "
406822	406828	406830	406830	Darrell	512	" Stay , oh stay ! "
406832	406874	406909	406909	her	11096	" Oh that I could dare to ask you to complete the sentence ! I know - I know by the mysterious sympathy of my own soul , that you could never deceive me more ! Is it - is it - "
406916	406939	407650	407650	he	628	" Again and now , till the grave - Oh , by this hallowing kiss , again - the Caroline of old ! "
407654	407691	None	None	None	None	" Ten to one that the old House of Vipont now weather the CRISIS ; and a thousand to one that I find at last my armchair at the hearth of my schoolfriend , Guy Darrell ! "
