534	628	524	524	he	349	' I made a point of never discussing these matters with her . As no doubt you guess , life has been rather an uphill journey with us . But the home must be guarded against sordid cares to the last possible moment ; nothing upsets me more than the sight of those poor homes where wife and children are obliged to talk from morning to night of how the sorry earnings shall be laid out . No , no ; women , old or young , should never have to think about money .
658	737	738	738	He	186	' There will come a day , Alice , when neither man nor woman is troubled with such sordid care . Not yet awhile ; no , no ; but the day will come .

2770	2796	2754	2754	she	438	' I have a difficulty in finding precisely what I want . One room would be sufficient , and I ask for very little attendance . '

2855	2868	2969	2969	She	447	' That would depend , mum , on what attendance was required . '
2869	2945	2843	2843	she	438	' Yes of course . I think will you permit me to sit down ? I am really very tired . Thank you . I require very little attendance indeed . My ways are very simple . I should make the bed myself , and and , do the other little things that are necessary from day to day . Perhaps I might ask you to sweep the room out once a week or so . '

2987	2995	2982	2982	her	447	' would you be thinking of paying ? '
2996	3127	2969	2969	She	447	' Perhaps I had better explain my position . For several years I have been companion to a lady in Hampshire . Her death has thrown me on my own resources I hope only for a short time . I have come to London because a younger sister of mine is employed here in a house of business ; she recommended me to seek for lodgings in this part ; I might as well be near her whilst I am endeavouring to find another post ; perhaps I may be fortunate enough to find one in London . Quietness and economy are necessary to me . A house like yours would suit me very well very well indeed . Could we not agree upon terms within my within my power ? '
3133	3144	3129	3130	the landlady	447	' Would you be willing to pay five and sixpence ? '
3145	3255	3289	3290	the landlady	447	' Yes , I would pay five and sixpence if you are quite sure that you could let me live in my own way with satisfaction to yourself . I in fact , I am a vegetarian , and as the meals I take are so very simple , I feel that I might just as well prepare them myself . Would you object to my doing so in this room ? A kettle and a saucepan are really all absolutely all that I should need to use . As I shall be much at home , it will be of course necessary for me to have a fire . '

3292	3347	3289	3290	the landlady	447	' I think I may say that of myself . If I make five or six shillings a week out of my spare room , I do n't grumble . But the party as takes it must do their duty on their side . You have n't told me your name yet , mum . '
3348	3389	3289	3290	the landlady	447	' Miss Madden . My luggage is at the railway station ; it shall be brought here this evening . And , as I am quite unknown to you , I shall be glad to pay my rent in advance . '
3390	3408	3289	3290	the landlady	447	' Well , I do n't ask for that ; but it 's just as you like . '
3409	3432	3289	3290	the landlady	447	' Then I will pay you five and sixpence at once . Be so kind as to let me have a receipt . '
3540	3564	3584	3585	The landlady	447	' 88 . Then , one afternoon , Miss Madden descended to the kitchen and tapped in her usual timid way at the door .
3565	3583	3584	3585	The landlady	447	' Are you at leisure , Mrs. Conisbee ? Could I have a little conversation with you ? '
3606	3649	3584	3585	The landlady	447	' I have mentioned my elder sister now and then . I am sorry to say she is leaving her post with the family at Hereford . The children are going to school , so that her services are no longer needed . '
3650	3655	3584	3585	The landlady	447	' Indeed , mum ? '
3656	3753	3584	3585	The landlady	447	' Yes . For a shorter or longer time she will be in need of a home . Now it has occurred to me , Mrs. Conisbee , that that I would ask you whether you would have any objection to her sharing my room with me ? Of course there must be an extra payment . The room is small for two persons , but then the arrangement would only be temporary . My sister is a good and experienced teacher , and I am sure she will have no difficulty in obtaining another engagement . '
3779	3791	3792	3792	she	206	' Well , it 's if you can manage , mum , '
3795	3843	3792	3792	she	206	' I do n't see as I could have any fault to find , if you thought you could both live in that little room . And as for the rent , I should be quite satisfied if we said seven shillings instead of five and six . '
3844	3886	3914	3915	Mrs. Conisbee	206	' Thank you , Mrs. Conisbee ; thank you very much indeed . I will write to my sister at once ; the news will be a great relief to her . We shall have quite an enjoyable little holiday together . '

Do you know , my dear , I am afraid I have not exerted myself as I might have done to find a new place .

7891	7941	7841	7841	she	191	' Oh yes , as she gives us the choice . How delightful ! I wonder what she is doing ? She writes cheerfully ; I am sure she must be in a good position . What is the address ? Queen 's Road , Chelsea . Oh , I 'm

8903	8925	8889	8889	She	462	' Yes , I must struggle against it . We will have dinner as soon as possible . I feel faint . '
8982	8994	8996	8996	Virginia	191	' Ah ! it 's a good sign to be hungry , '
8998	9008	8996	8996	Virginia	191	' You 'll be better this afternoon , dear . '

9636	9667	9630	9630	she	197	' So long as that ? How I wish I had known you were so near ! I have been in London myself about two years . And your sisters ? '
9676	9714	9668	9668	Virginia	191	' As for poor Monica , she has only Sunday free except one evening a month . She is at business till half - past nine , and on Saturday till half - past eleven or twelve . '

9744	9758	9734	9734	her	197	' That will never do . You must put a stop to that . '

9788	9824	9734	9734	her	197	' Yes , yes ; we will talk about it presently . Poor little Monica ! But do tell me about yourself and Miss Madden . It is so long since I heard about you . '
9825	9869	9734	9734	her	197	' Indeed I ought to have written . I remember that at the end of our correspondence I remained in your debt . But it was a troublesome and depressing time with me . I had nothing but groans and moans to send . '
9870	9886	9734	9734	her	197	' You did n't stay long , I trust , with that trying Mrs. Carr ? '
9887	9891	9893	9893	Virginia	191	' Three years ! '

9902	9941	9734	9734	her	197	' I wished to leave again and again . But at the end she always begged me not to desert her that was how she put it . After all , I never had the heart to go . '
9942	9966	9734	9734	her	197	' Very kind of you , but those questions are so difficult to decide . Self - sacrifice may be quite wrong , I 'm
9969	9969	9734	9734	her	197	'
9970	9976	9978	9978	Virginia	191	' Do you think so ? '
9981	10016	9734	9734	her	197	' Yes , I am sure it is often wrong all the more so because people proclaim it a virtue without any reference to circumstances . Then how did you get away at last ? '
10017	10048	9734	9734	her	197	' The poor woman died . Then I had a place scarcely less disagreeable . Now I have none at all ; but I really must find one very soon . '
10063	10075	10077	10078	Miss Nunn	197	' Let me tell you what my own course has been , '
10085	10154	10077	10078	Miss Nunn	197	' When my mother died , I determined to have done with teaching you know that . I disliked it too much , and partly , of course , because I was incapable . Half my teaching was a sham a pretence of knowing what I neither knew nor cared to know . I had gone into it like most girls , as a dreary matter of course . '
10155	10161	9734	9734	her	197	' Like poor Alice , I 'm
10164	10164	9734	9734	her	197	'
10165	10377	9734	9734	her	197	' Oh , it 's a distressing subject . When my mother left me that little sum of money I took a bold step . I went to Bristol to learn everything I could that would help me out of school life . Shorthand , book - keeping , commercial correspondence I had lessons in them all , and worked desperately for a year . It did me good ; at the end of the year I was vastly improved in health , and felt myself worth something in the world . I got a place as cashier in a large shop . That soon tired me , and by dint of advertising I found a place in an office at Bath . It was a move towards London , and I could n't rest till I had come the whole way . My first engagement here was as shorthand writer to the secretary of a company . But he soon wanted some one who could use a typewriter . That was a suggestion . I went to learn typewriting , and the lady who taught me asked me in the end to stay with her as an assistant . This is her house , and here I live with her . '
10378	10385	9734	9734	her	197	' How energetic you have been ! '
10386	10537	9734	9734	her	197	' How fortunate , perhaps . I must tell you about this lady Miss Barfoot . She has private means not large , but sufficient to allow of her combining benevolence with business . She makes it her object to train young girls for work in offices , teaching them the things that I learnt in Bristol , and typewriting as well . Some pay for their lessons , and some get them for nothing . Our workrooms are in Great Portland Street , over a picture - cleaner 's shop . One or two girls have evening lessons , but our pupils for the most part are able to come in the day . Miss Barfoot has n't much interest in the lower classes ; she wishes to be of use to the daughters of educated people . And she is of use . She is doing admirable work . '

10554	10565	9734	9734	her	197	' It occurs to me that she might help Monica . '
10566	10575	10577	10577	Virginia	191	' Oh , do you think she would ? '
10583	10590	10577	10577	Virginia	191	' How grateful we should be ! '
10591	10597	9734	9734	her	197	' Where is Monica employed ? '
10598	10664	10577	10577	Virginia	191	' At a draper 's in Walworth Road . She is worked to death . Every week I see a difference in her , poor child . We hoped to persuade her to go back to the shop at Weston ; but if this you speak of were possible how much better ! We have never reconciled ourselves to her being in that position never . '
10665	10675	10677	10678	Miss Nunn	197	' I see no harm in the position itself , '
10685	10722	10677	10678	Miss Nunn	197	' but I see a great deal in those outrageous hours . She wo n't easily do better in London , without special qualifications ; and probably she is reluctant to go back to the country . '
10723	10732	10577	10577	Virginia	191	' Yes , she is ; very reluctant . '
10733	10738	10740	10741	the other	462	' I understand it , '
10747	10758	10740	10741	the other	462	' Will you ask her to come and see me ? '
10779	10816	10817	10817	she	197	' I had no midday meal to - day , and really I feel the omission . Mary , please do put tea in the dining - room , and bring up some meat Miss Barfoot , '
10850	10850	10843	10843	you	191	'
10942	10952	10954	10955	Miss Nunn	197	' Now let us go back to the library , '
10963	11001	10954	10955	Miss Nunn	197	' We shall soon see each other again , I hope , but we might as well talk of serious things whilst we have the opportunity . Will you allow me to be very frank with you ? '
11007	11018	11002	11003	The other	462	' What could you possibly say that would offend me ? '
11019	11038	11002	11003	The other	462	' In the old days you told me all about your circumstances . Are they still the same ? '
11039	11067	11002	11003	The other	462	' Precisely the same . Most happily , we have never needed to entrench upon our capital . Whatever happens , we must avoid that whatever happens ! '
11068	11110	11002	11003	The other	462	' I quite understand you . But would n't it be possible to make a better use of that money ? It is eight hundred pounds , I think ? Have you never thought of employing it in some practical enterprise ? '
11128	11138	11002	11003	The other	462	' Would it be possible ? Really ? You think '
11139	11164	11002	11003	The other	462	' I can only suggest , of course . One must n't argue about others from one 's own habit of thought . Heaven forbid '
11172	11197	11002	11003	The other	462	' that I should urge you to do anything you would think rash . But how much better if you could somehow secure independence . '
11198	11224	11002	11003	The other	462	' Ah , if we could ! The very thing we were saying the other day ! But how ? I have no idea how . '
11231	11290	11225	11226	Miss Nunn	197	' I do n't advise . You must n't give any weight to what I say , except in so far as your own judgment approves it . But could n't one open a preparatory school , for instance ? At Weston , suppose , where already you know a good many people . Or even at Clevedon . '
11391	11399	11401	11402	Miss Nunn	197	' Do take some of these flowers , '
11412	11447	11401	11402	Miss Nunn	197	' Let them be my message to your sister . And I should be so glad to see Monica . Sunday is a good time ; I am always at home in the afternoon . '

12325	12331	12332	12332	Monica	195	' Yes ; some distance . '

12465	12479	12385	12385	she	195	' At least she wished to go if she could find a companion . '
12480	12488	12490	12491	Mr. Bullivant	215	' I hope she will enjoy herself , '
12497	12532	12385	12385	she	195	' But of course she wo n't enjoy it very much if she has to go alone . As you have no particular engagement , Mr. Bullivant , would n't it be kind to ? '
12541	12554	12556	12558	the young man	667	' I could n't ask Miss Eade to let me accompany her , '
12561	12574	12556	12558	the young man	667	' Oh , I think you could . She would like it . '
12586	12600	12575	12575	Monica	195	' Now I must say good - bye . There comes the bus . '

12713	12723	12650	12650	Monica	195	' I think when I have begged you not to '
12724	12750	12685	12687	the young fellow	674	' I know how bad my behaviour must seem . But , Miss Madden , may I not be on terms of friendship with you ? '
12751	12764	12650	12650	Monica	195	' Of course you may but you are not content with that . '
12765	12772	12685	12687	the young fellow	674	' Yes indeed I will be content '
12773	12792	12650	12650	Monica	195	' It 's foolish to say so . Have n't you broken the understanding three or four times ? '
12809	12815	12817	12817	Bullivant	215	' I am so sorry , '
12827	12874	12817	12817	Bullivant	215	' I try not to worry you . Think of my position . You have told me that there is no one else who whose rights I ought to respect . Feeling as I do , it is n't in human nature to give up hope ! '
12875	12887	12917	12917	Bullivant	215	' Then will you let me ask you a rude question ? '
12888	12897	12817	12817	Bullivant	215	' Ask me any question , Miss Madden . '
12898	12911	12917	12917	Bullivant	215	' How would it be possible for you to support a wife ? '
12930	12940	12941	12941	he	215	' It would n't be possible for some time , '
12948	12962	12941	12941	he	215	' I have nothing but my wretched salary . But every one hopes . '
12963	12970	12971	12971	Monica	195	' What reasonable hope have you ? '
12994	13067	12971	12971	Monica	195	' Oh , there are so many opportunities in our business . I could point to half a dozen successful men who were at the counter a few years ago . I may become a walker , and get at least three pounds a week . If I were lucky enough to be taken on as a buyer , I might make why , some make many hundreds a year many hundreds . '
13068	13086	12971	12971	Monica	195	' And you would ask me to wait on and on for one of these wonderful chances ? '
13087	13098	13099	13099	he	215	' If I could move your feelings , Miss Madden , '
13131	13232	13114	13114	He	215	' Mr. Bullivant , I think you ought to wait until you really have prospects . If you were encouraged by some person , it would be a different thing . And indeed you have n't to look far . But where there has never been the slightest encouragement , you are really wrong to act in this way . A long engagement , where everything remains doubtful for years , is so wretched that oh , if I were a man , I would never try to persuade a girl into that ! I think it wrong and cruel . '
13269	13280	13281	13281	he	215	' I will say good - morning , Miss Madden , '
13368	13409	13351	13351	Virginia	191	' You are nice and early ! Poor Alice has been in bed since the day before yesterday ; a dreadful cold and one of her very worst headaches . But I think she is a little better this morning . '
13420	13428	13429	13429	she	191	' Do n't kiss me , darling , '
13438	13453	13429	13429	she	191	' You must n't risk getting a sore throat . How well you look ! '

13489	13538	13481	13481	Monica	195	' use her voice , I will speak for both of us , and wish you many , many happy returns of the day . And we ask you to accept this little book from us . It may be a comfort to you from time to time . '
13539	13547	13549	13549	Monica	195	' You are good , kind dears ! '
13567	13611	13549	13549	Monica	195	' It 's no use saying you ought n't to have spent money on me ; you will always do it . What a nice " Christian Year " ! I 'll do my best to read some of it now and then . '
13665	13675	13676	13677	The others	397	' But you are ruining yourselves , foolish people ! '
13697	13701	13702	13702	she	195	' I know ! '
13705	13722	13702	13702	she	195	' There 's good news . You have found something , and better than usual Virgie . '
13723	13750	13789	13789	she	191	' Perhaps so . Who knows ? Eat your slice of cake like a good child , and then I shall have something to tell you . '
13778	13788	13789	13789	she	191	' You would never guess whom I have seen , '
13800	13829	13789	13789	she	191	' We had a letter the other morning which did puzzle us so I mean the writing before we opened it . And it was from Miss Nunn ! '
13838	13851	13852	13852	she	191	' You had quite lost sight of her , had n't you ? '
13855	13885	13789	13789	she	191	' Quite . I did n't suppose we should ever hear of her again . But nothing more fortunate could have happened . My dear , she is wonderful ! '
13907	13998	13892	13892	she	191	' She will be the most valuable friend to us . Oh , her strength , her resolution ! The way in which she discovers the right thing to do ! You are to call upon her as soon as possible . This very after noon you had better go . She will relieve you from all your troubles darling . Her friend , Miss Barfoot , will teach you typewriting , and put you in the way of earning an easy and pleasant livelihood . She will , indeed ! '
13999	14007	14009	14011	the astonished girl	691	' But how long does it take ? '
14013	14050	14052	14052	Virginia	191	' Oh , quite a short time , I should think . We did n't speak of details ; they were postponed . You will hear everything yourself . And she suggested all sorts of ways , '
14059	14113	14052	14052	Virginia	191	' in which we could make better use of our invested money . She is full of practical expedients . The most wonderful person ! She is quite like a man in energy and resources . I never imagined that one of our sex could resolve and plan and act as she does ! '
14127	14133	14052	14052	Virginia	191	' Nothing is decided yet , '
14144	14163	14052	14052	Virginia	191	' Let us first of all put you in comfort and security ; that is the immediate need . '
14237	14251	14252	14252	Monica	195	' Do n't you think we might go out for half an hour ? '
14266	14268	14252	14252	Monica	195	' I 'm
14284	14284	14252	14252	Monica	195	'
14293	14299	14285	14285	I	0	' the other whispered back . '
14333	14333	14301	14301	I	0	'
15414	15426	15429	15429	he	736	' I should be sorry if I never saw you again . '
15487	15537	15538	15538	he	736	' We meet in this casual way , and talk , and then say good - bye . Why may n't I tell you that you interest me very much , and that I am afraid to trust only to chance for another meeting ? If you were a man '
15540	15564	15538	15538	he	736	' I should give you my card , and ask you to my house . The card I may at all events offer . '
15591	15595	15568	15568	he	736	' thank you , '
15610	15620	15621	15621	he	736	' You are on my side of the river , '
15631	15672	15621	15621	he	736	' May I not hope to see you some day , when you are walking ? All days and times are the same to me ; but I am afraid it is only on Sunday that you are at leisure ? '
15673	15681	15621	15621	he	736	' Yes , only on a Sunday . '
15946	15954	15939	15939	he	350	' And now to God the Father . '
16368	16376	16378	16378	Rhoda	197	' I should never have known you , '
16383	16414	16378	16378	Rhoda	197	' For one thing , you look like a fever patient just recovering . What can be expected ? Your sister gave me a shocking account of how you live . '
16415	16422	16378	16378	Rhoda	197	' The work is very hard . '
16423	16437	16378	16378	Rhoda	197	' Preposterous . Why do you stay at such a place , Monica ? '
16438	16444	16378	16378	Rhoda	197	' I am getting experience . '
16445	16454	16378	16378	Rhoda	197	' To be used in the next world ? '
16458	16470	16541	16541	she	197	' Miss Madden is better to - day , I hope ? '
16471	16478	16541	16541	she	197	' Alice ? Not much , I 'm
16483	16483	16541	16541	she	197	'
16484	16511	16541	16541	she	197	' Will you tell me something more about the " experience " you are getting ? For instance , what time is given you for meals ? '
16552	16561	16562	16562	Monica	195	' There 's twenty minutes for each meal , '
16565	16595	16562	16562	Monica	195	' but at dinner and tea one is very likely to be called into the shop before finishing . If you are long away you find the table cleared . '
16596	16610	16541	16541	she	197	' Charming arrangement ! No sitting down behind the counter , I suppose ? '
16611	16689	16562	16562	Monica	195	' Oh , of course not . We stiffer a great deal from that . Some of us get diseases . A girl has just gone to the hospital with varicose veins , and two or three others have the same thing in a less troublesome form . Sometimes , on Saturday night , I lose all feeling in my feet ; I have to stamp on the floor to be sure it 's still under me . '
16690	16697	16541	16541	she	197	' Ah , that Saturday night ! '
16698	16755	16562	16562	Monica	195	' Yes , it 's bad enough now ; but at Christmas ! There was a week or more of Saturday night going on to one o'clock in the morning . A girl by me was twice carried out fainting , one night after another . They gave her brandy , and she came back again . '
16756	16762	16541	16541	she	197	' They compelled her to ? '
16763	16875	16562	16562	Monica	195	' Well , no , it was her own wish . Her " book of takings " was n't very good , poor thing , and if it did n't come up to a certain figure at the end of the week she would lose her place . She lost it after all . They told her she was too weak . After Christmas she was lucky enough to get a place as a lady's - maid at twenty - five pounds a year at Scotcher 's she had fifteen . But we heard that she burst a blood - vessel , and now she 's in the hospital at Brompton . '
16876	16889	16541	16541	she	197	' Delightful story ! Have n't you an early - closing day ? '
16890	16911	16562	16562	Monica	195	' They had before I went there ; but only for about three months . Then the agreement broke down . '
16912	16926	16541	16541	she	197	' Like the assistants . A pity the establishment does n't follow suit . '
16927	16957	16562	16562	Monica	195	' But you would n't say so , Miss Nunn , if you knew how terribly hard it is for many girls to find a place , even now . '
16958	17016	16541	16541	she	197	' I know it perfectly well . And I wish it were harder . I wish girls fell down and died of hunger in the streets , instead of creeping to their garrets and the hospitals . I should like to see their dead bodies collected together in some open place for the crowd to stare at . '
17025	17040	16562	16562	Monica	195	' You mean , I suppose , that people would try to reform things . '
17041	17072	16562	16562	Monica	195	' Who knows ? Perhaps they might only congratulate each other that a few of the superfluous females had been struck off . Do they give you any summer holiday ? '
17073	17081	16562	16562	Monica	195	' A week , with salary continued . '
17082	17104	16562	16562	Monica	195	' Really ? With salary continued ? That takes one 's breath away . - Are many of the girls ladies ? '
17105	17146	16562	16562	Monica	195	' None , at Scotcher 's . They nearly all come from the country . Several are daughters of small farmers and those are dreadfully ignorant . One of them asked me the other day in what country Africa was . '
17147	17157	16562	16562	Monica	195	' You do n't find them very pleasant company ? '
17158	17167	16562	16562	Monica	195	' One or two are nice quiet girls . '
17179	17197	16562	16562	Monica	195	' Well , do n't you think you 've had about enough of it experience and all ? '
17198	17212	16562	16562	Monica	195	' I might go into a country business : it would be easier . '
17213	17223	16562	16562	Monica	195	' But you do n't care for the thought ? '
17224	17267	16562	16562	Monica	195	' I wish now they had brought me up to something different . Alice and Virginia were afraid of having me trained for a school ; you remember that one of our sisters who went through it died of overwork . And I 'm
17281	17281	17274	17274	I	0	'
17289	17298	17282	17282	Rhoda	197	' You have no inclination to study now ? '
17299	17301	17282	17282	Rhoda	197	' I 'm
17305	17313	17282	17282	Rhoda	197	' replied the other , looking away . '
17348	17348	17282	17282	Rhoda	197	'
17349	17396	17282	17282	Rhoda	197	' Perhaps so . But there are things you might manage . No doubt your sister told you how I get my living . There 's a good deal of employment for women who learn to use a typewriter . Did you ever have piano lessons ? '
17397	17400	17282	17282	Rhoda	197	' No . '
17401	17444	17282	17282	Rhoda	197	' No more did I , and I was sorry for it when I went to typewriting . The fingers have to be light and supple and quick . Come with me , and I 'll show you one of the machines . '
17471	17506	17465	17465	Rhoda	197	' One must practise until one can do fifty words a minute at least . I know one or two people who have reached almost twice that speed . It takes a good six months '
17520	17520	17515	17516	Miss Barfoot	212	'
17552	17563	17539	17540	The other	462	' Do you feel any impulse to try for it ? '
17564	17577	17614	17614	she	197	' I should have to live for six months without earning anything . '
17578	17591	17539	17540	The other	462	' That is by no means impossible for you , I think ? '
17592	17597	17598	17598	Monica	195	' Not really impossible , '
17649	17664	17614	17614	she	197	' Let us go back to the drawing - room and have some tea . '
17771	17852	17761	17761	Rhoda	197	' So it is your birthday ? I no longer keep count of mine , and could n't tell you without a calculation what I am exactly . It does n't matter , you see . Thirty - one or fifty - one is much the same for a woman who has made up her mind to live alone and work steadily for a definite object . But you are still a young girl , Monica . My best wishes ! '
17868	17875	17877	17878	the other	462	' How shall I put it ? '
17882	17890	17877	17878	the other	462	' To make women hard - hearted . '
17891	17901	17943	17943	Monica	195	' Hard - hearted ? I think I understand . '
17902	17906	17877	17878	the other	462	' Do you ? '
17907	17919	17943	17943	Monica	195	' You mean that you like to see them live unmarried . '
17924	17932	17920	17920	Rhoda	197	' You say that almost with resentment . '
17933	17942	17877	17878	the other	462	' No indeed I did n't intend it . '
17948	17967	17920	17920	Rhoda	197	' Nothing more natural if you have done . At your age , I should have resented it . '
17968	17970	17971	17972	the girl	384	' But '
17974	17984	17971	17972	the girl	384	' do n't you approve of any one marrying ? '
17985	17989	17920	17920	Rhoda	197	' Oh , I 'm
18015	18015	17996	17996	you	384	'
18016	18021	18022	18022	Her	195	' Half a million ! '
18031	18123	18027	18027	Rhoda	197	' Something like that , they say . So many odd women no making a pair with them . The pessimists call them useless , lost , futile lives . I , naturally being one of them myself take another view . I look upon them as a great reserve . When one woman vanishes in matrimony , the reserve offers a substitute for the world 's work . True , they are not all trained yet far from it . I want to help in that to train the reserve . '
18124	18132	18134	18134	Monica	195	' But married woman are not idle , '
18137	18149	18027	18027	Rhoda	197	' Not all of them . Some cook and rock cradles . '
18209	18218	18219	18219	Rhoda	197	' Will you come and see Miss Barfoot ? '
18237	18261	18219	18219	Rhoda	197	' I am only her subordinate , but I know she will wish to be of all the use to you she can . '
18668	18679	18680	18680	he	742	' I am so glad you were able to come , '
18691	18701	18710	18710	she	195	' It has been even finer than last Sunday , '
18719	18741	18710	18710	she	195	' Yes , a wonderful day . But I only left home an hour ago . Shall we walk this way ? '
18820	18828	18918	18918	she	809	' Have you been into the country ? '
18836	18860	18918	18918	she	809	' No . I spent the morning with my sisters , and in the afternoon I had to see a lady in Chelsea . '
18861	18869	18918	18918	she	809	' Your sisters are older than yourself ? '
18870	18877	18918	18918	she	809	' Yes , some years older . '
18878	18891	18918	18918	she	809	' Is it long since you went to live apart from them ? '
18892	18909	18918	18918	she	809	' We have never had a home of our own since I was quite a child . '
19072	19081	19082	19082	he	217	' I supposed you were not a Londoner , '
19092	19095	19134	19134	He	217	' How ? '
19096	19102	19103	19103	he	217	' Your speech . Not , '
19107	19133	19103	19103	he	217	' that you have any provincial accent . And even if you had been a Londoner you would not have shown it in that way . '
19156	19163	19134	19134	He	217	' Do you prefer the town ? '
19164	19172	19134	19134	He	217	' In some ways not in all . '
19173	19199	19134	19134	He	217	' I am glad you have relatives here , and friends . So many young ladies come up from the country who are quite alone . '
19200	19205	19134	19134	He	217	' Yes , many . '
19299	19309	19282	19282	Widdowson	217	' Would you care to go on the river ? '
19340	19349	19350	19350	he	217	' It would be pleasant , I think , '
19353	19381	19350	19350	he	217	' The tide is still running up . We might go very quietly for a mile or two , and be back as soon as you like . '
19382	19390	19391	19391	He	217	' Yes , I should like it . '
19546	19553	19554	19554	he	217	' I am at your service , '
19563	19587	19554	19554	he	217	' Direct me . Shall we go quickly some distance , or only just a little quicker than the tide would float us ? '
19588	19602	19639	19639	He	217	' Which you like . To row much would make you too hot . '
19603	19614	19554	19554	he	217	' You would like to go some distance I see . '
19615	19638	19639	19639	He	217	' No , no . Do exactly what you like . Of course we must be back in an hour or two . '
19645	19671	19554	19554	he	217	' It 's now ten minutes past six , and there is daylight till nine or after . When do you wish to be home ? '
19672	19679	19680	19680	Monica	195	' Not much later than nine , '
19689	19720	19554	19554	he	217	' Then we will just go quietly along . I wish we could have started early in the afternoon . But that may be for another day , I hope . '
19761	19777	19778	19778	he	217	' I was very much afraid that I should not see you to - day , '
19789	19800	19778	19778	he	217	' But I promised to come if it was fine . '
19801	19821	19822	19822	He	217	' Yes . I feared something might prevent you . You are very kind to give me your company . '
19833	19843	19822	19822	He	217	' I ca n't say how I thank you . '
19872	19876	19877	19877	he	217	' Last year , '
19880	19908	19877	19877	he	217	' I went on the river two or three times , but alone . This year I have n't been in a boat till to - day . '
19909	19914	19778	19778	he	217	' You prefer driving ? '
19915	20004	19877	19877	he	217	' Oh , it 's only chance . I do drive a good deal , however . I wish it were possible to take you through the splendid country I saw a day or two ago down in Surrey . Perhaps some day you will let me . I live rather a lonely life , as you see . I have a housekeeper ; no relative lives with me . My only relative in London is a sister - in - law , and we very seldom meet . '
20005	20016	19778	19778	he	217	' But do n't you employ yourself in any way ? '
20017	20019	19877	19877	he	217	' I 'm
20069	20069	20060	20060	I	0	'
20070	20076	20078	20078	Monica	195	' This is your birthday ? '
20090	20162	20078	20078	Monica	195	' Yes I only remembered it a few hours ago . Strange that such a treat should have been provided for me . Yes , I am very idle . A year and a half ago my only brother died . He had been very successful in life , and he left me what I regard as a fortune , though it was only a small part of what he had . '
20187	20194	20196	20196	Widdowson	217	' The left hand a little , '
20201	20241	20196	20196	Widdowson	217	' That 's right . Many days I do n't leave home . I am fond of reading , and now I make up for all the time lost in years gone by . Do you care for books ? '
20242	20255	20173	20173	she	195	' I never read very much , and I feel very ignorant . '
20256	20267	20196	20196	Widdowson	217	' But that is only for want of opportunity , I 'm
20270	20270	20196	20196	Widdowson	217	'
20305	20313	20319	20319	she	195	' I thought it was a book ! '
20328	20336	20338	20338	Monica	195	' When you told me your name , '
20340	20364	20338	20338	Monica	195	' I ought perhaps to have told you mine . It 's written here . My sisters gave me this to - day . '
20395	20403	20319	20319	she	195	' What ? It is your birthday ? '
20404	20413	20365	20365	She	195	' Yes . I am twenty - one . '
20414	20424	20425	20425	His	217	' Will you let me shake hands with you ? '
20435	20497	20425	20425	His	217	' Now that 's rather a strange thing is n't it ? Oh , I remember this book very well , though I have n't seen it or heard of it for twenty years . My mother used to read it on Sundays . And it is really your birthday ? I am more than twice your age , Miss Madden . '
20543	20549	20551	20552	her companion	812	' I do n't think , '
20555	20570	20551	20552	her companion	812	' you are very well contented with your life in that house of business . '
20571	20578	20604	20604	she	195	' No , I am not . '
20579	20602	20551	20552	her companion	812	' I have heard a good deal of the hardships of such a life . Will you tell me something about yours ? '
20633	20640	20642	20642	Widdowson	217	' You must be very strong , '
20646	20661	20604	20604	she	195	' The lady I went to see this afternoon told me I looked ill . '
20662	20690	20691	20691	Monica	195	' Of course I can see the effects of overwork . My wonder is that you endure it at all . Is that lady an old acquaintance ? '
20806	20809	20812	20812	him	217	' Yes , '
20827	20912	20822	20822	he	217	' I began to earn my bread when I was fourteen . My father was an auctioneer at Brighton . A few years after his marriage he had a bad illness , which left him completely deaf . His partnership with another man was dissolved , and as things went worse and worse with him , my mother started a lodging - house , which somehow supported us for a long time . She was a sensible , good , and brave woman . I 'm
21115	21115	21092	21092	he	3748	'
21125	21130	21132	21132	Monica	195	' What happened them ? '
21134	21147	21148	21148	he	3748	' I must n't make out that I was a faultless boy , '
21161	21290	21148	21148	he	3748	' quite the opposite . I had a good deal of my father 's temper ; I often behaved very badly to my mother ; what I needed was some stern but conscientious man to look after me and make me work . In my spare time I lay about on the shore , or got into mischief with other boys . It needed my mother 's death to make a more sensible fellow of me , and by that time it was too late . I mean I was too old to be trained into profitable business habits . Up to nineteen I had been little more than an errand and office boy , and all through the after years I never got a much better position . '
21291	21298	21300	21300	Monica	195	' I ca n't understand that , '
21303	21307	21148	21148	he	3748	' Why not ? '
21308	21324	21148	21148	he	3748	' You seem to to be the kind of man that would make your way . '
21325	21329	21148	21148	he	3748	' Do I ? '
21339	21463	21335	21335	he	849	' But I never found what my way was to be . I have always hated office work , and business of every kind ; yet I could never see an opening in any other direction . I have been all my life a clerk like so many thousands of other men . Nowadays , if I happen to be in the City when all the clerks are coming away from business , I feel an inexpressible pity for them . I feel I should like to find two or three of the hardest driven , and just divide my superfluous income between . A clerk 's life a life of the office without any hope of rising that is a hideous fate ! '
21464	21479	21148	21148	he	3748	' But your brother got on well . Why did n't he help you ? '
21480	21490	21335	21335	he	849	' We could n't agree . We always quarrelled . '
21491	21500	21148	21148	he	3748	' Are you really so ill - tempered ? '
21528	21535	21536	21536	he	217	' Since I was a lad , '
21539	21629	21536	21536	he	217	' I have never quarrelled with any one except my brother . I think it 's only very unreasonable people that irritate me . Some men have told me that I was far too easy - going , too good - natured . Certainly I desire to be good - natured . But I do n't easily make friends ; as a rule I ca n't talk to strangers . I keep so much to myself that those who know me only a little think me surly and unsociable . '
21630	21640	21335	21335	he	849	' So your brother always refused to help you ? '
21641	21882	21536	21536	he	217	' It was n't easy for him to help me . He got into a stockbroker 's , and went on step by step until he had saved a little money ; then he speculated in all sorts of ways . He could n't employ me himself and if he could have done so , we should never have got on together . It was impossible for him to recommend me to any one except as a clerk . He was a born money - maker . I 'll give you an example of how he grew rich . In consequence of some mortgage business he came into possession of a field at Clapham . As late as 1875 this field brought him only a rent of forty pounds ; it was freehold property , and he refused many offers of purchase . Well , in 1885 , the year before he died , the ground - rents from that field now covered with houses were seven hundred and ninety pounds a year . That 's how men get on who have capital and know how to use it . If I had had capital , it would never have yielded me more than three or four per cent . I was doomed to work for other people who were growing rich . It does n't matter much now , except that so many years of life have been lost . '
21883	21890	21335	21335	he	849	' Had your brother any children ? '
21891	21948	21536	21536	he	217	' No children . All the same , it astonished me when I heard his will ; I had expected nothing . In one day in one hour I passed from slavery to freedom , from poverty to more than comfort . We never hated each other ; I do n't want you to think that . '
21949	21962	21335	21335	he	849	' But did n't it bring you friends as well as comfort ? '
21963	21966	21967	21967	he	850	' Oh , '
21970	21994	21967	21967	he	850	' I am not so rich as to have people pressing for my acquaintance . I have only about six hundred a year . '
22008	22100	21335	21335	he	849	' No , I have n't made any new friends . The one or two men I care for are not much better off than I used to be , and I always feel ashamed to ask them to come and see me . Perhaps they think I shun them because of their position , and I do n't know how to justify myself . Life has always been full of worrying problems for me . I ca n't take things in the simple way that comes natural to other men . '
22101	22116	21335	21335	he	849	' Do n't you think we ought to be turning back , Mr. Widdowson ? '
22117	22132	21335	21335	he	849	' Yes , we will . I am sorry the time goes so quickly . '
22145	22163	22142	22142	he	851	' Do you feel that I am no longer quite a stranger to you , Miss Madden ? '
22164	22173	21335	21335	he	849	' Yes you have told me so much . '
22174	22207	22208	22208	He	851	' It 's very kind of you to listen so patiently . I wish I had more interesting things to tell , but you see what a dull life mine has been . '
22223	22263	22208	22208	He	851	' When I dared to speak to you last Sunday I had only the faintest hope that you would grant me your acquaintance . You ca n't , I am sure , repent of having done me that kindness ? '
22264	22279	21335	21335	he	849	' One never knows . I doubted whether I ought to talk with a stranger '
22280	22319	22320	22320	He	854	' Rightly quite rightly . It was my perseverance you saw , I hope , that I could never dream of giving you offence . The rule is necessary , but you see there may be exceptional cases . '
22344	22370	22320	22320	He	854	' I saw something in your face that compelled me to speak to you . And now we may really be friends , I hope ? '
22371	22385	21335	21335	he	849	' Yes I can think of you as a friend , Mr. Widdowson . '
22454	22483	22570	22570	his	860	' And you will let me see you again before long ? Let me drive you to Hampton Court next Sunday or any other place you would choose . '
22484	22498	22570	22570	his	860	' Very likely I shall be invited to my friend 's in Chelsea . '
22499	22509	22570	22570	his	860	' Do you seriously think of leaving the shop ? '
22510	22523	22570	22570	his	860	' I do n't know I must have time to think about it '
22524	22551	22570	22570	his	860	' Yes yes . But if I write a line to you , say on Friday , would you let me know whether you can come ? '
22552	22567	22568	22568	He	860	' Please to let me refuse for next Sunday . The one after , perhaps '
22638	22646	22648	22648	Monica	195	' Now I must go quickly home , '
22650	22654	22666	22666	Widdowson	217	' But how ? '
22655	22665	22666	22666	Widdowson	217	' By train from York Road to Walworth Road . '
22692	22704	22666	22666	Widdowson	217	' I will go with you to the station , then . '
22733	22740	22744	22744	his	217	' I may write to you , '
22753	22768	22744	22744	his	217	' and make an appointment , if possible , for the Sunday after next ? '
22769	22780	22744	22744	his	217	' I shall be glad to come if I can . '
22781	22792	22744	22744	his	217	' It will be a very long time to me . '
22875	22896	22872	22873	Miss Eade	216	' I want to speak to you , Miss Madden . Where did you go with Mr. Bullivant this morning ? '
22917	22928	22849	22868	a tall , showily - dressed , rather coarse - featured girl , who seemed to have been loitering about	869	' With Mr. Bullivant ? I went nowhere with him . '
22929	22944	22872	22873	Miss Eade	216	' But I saw you both get into the bus in Kennington Park Road . '
22945	22949	22950	22950	Monica	195	' Did you ? '
22954	22971	22950	22950	Monica	195	' I ca n't help it if Mr. Bullivant happened to be going the same way . '
22972	22991	22950	22950	Monica	195	' Oh , very well ! I thought you was to be trusted . It 's nothing to me '
22992	23001	22950	22950	Monica	195	' You behave very foolishly , Miss Eade , '
23023	23049	22950	22950	Monica	195	' I can only tell you that I have never thought again of Mr. Bullivant since he left the bus somewhere in Clapham Road . I 'm
23057	23057	22950	22950	Monica	195	'
23058	23077	22950	22950	Monica	195	' Now , see here , do n't be cross . Come and walk a bit and tell me '
23078	23080	22950	22950	Monica	195	' I 'm
23093	23093	22950	22950	Monica	195	'
23094	23101	22950	22950	Monica	195	' Oh , well , if you 're

23119	23158	23113	23114	the girl	384	' Do n't be so sharp with me , Miss Madden . I do n't say as you wanted him to go in the bus with you . But you might tell me what he had to say . '
23159	23213	23113	23114	the girl	384	' Nothing at all ; except that he wished to know where I was going , which was no business of his . I did what I could for you . I told him that if he asked you to go up the river with him I felt sure you would n't refuse . '
23214	23220	23221	23222	Miss Eade	216	' Oh , you did ! '
23228	23242	23225	23225	her	216	' I do n't think it was a very delicate thing to say . '
23243	23272	23113	23114	the girl	384	' You are very unreasonable . I myself do n't think it was very delicate , but have n't you worried me to say something of the kind ? '
23273	23278	23225	23225	her	216	' No , that I 'm
23289	23289	23113	23114	the girl	384	'

23310	23323	23113	23114	the girl	384	' And what did he say , when you 'd said that ? '
23324	23330	23113	23114	the girl	384	' I ca n't remember . '
23331	23368	23113	23114	the girl	384	' Oh , you are narsty to - day ! Really you are ! If it had been the other way about , I 'd never have treated you like this , that I would n't . '

23414	23419	23420	23420	she	216	' Do tell me ! '
23423	23441	23420	23420	she	216	' I 'll do anything for you I can . Do n't be unkind , Miss Madden ! '
23447	23480	23442	23442	Monica	195	' If I were you , I would n't be so silly . I ca n't do more than assure you and promise you that I shall never listen to Mr. Bullivant . '
23481	23492	23442	23442	Monica	195	' But what did he say about me , dear ? '
23493	23496	23442	23442	Monica	195	' Nothing . '
23504	23534	23497	23498	Miss Eade	216	' You had much better not think of him at all . I would have more pride . I wish I could make you see him as I do . '
23535	23561	23442	23442	Monica	195	' And you did really speak about me ? Oh , I do wish you 'd find some one to go out with . Then perhaps '
23573	23581	23562	23562	Monica	195	' Well I have found some one . '
23582	23586	23587	23588	The girl	384	' You have ? '

23900	23944	23897	23897	inquiries	222	' He 's oldish , I should say . I caught sight of them just as they was going off in a boat from Battersea Park , but I could n't see his face very well . He looked rather like Mr. Thomas . '
23974	23980	23982	23982	one	472	' Was he a swell ? '
23984	24011	23982	23982	one	472	' Should n't wonder if he was . You can trust Miss M. to keep her eyes open . She 's one of the sly and quiet '

24015	24021	24023	24024	another enviously	890	' Oh , is she ? '
24026	24044	24023	24024	another enviously	890	' She 's just one of those as gets made a fool of that 's my opinion . '
24244	24252	24232	24234	The gifted anecdotist	897	' Good - night , young ladies ! '

24767	24834	24754	24755	Miss Barfoot	212	' Nothing but a business transaction , Miss Madden . You can give me security ; you will repay me at your convenience . If , in the end , this occupation does n't please you , you will at all events have regained health . It is clear to me that you must n't go on in that dreadful place you described to Miss Nunn . '
24845	24852	24854	24855	Miss Barfoot	212	' Poor things ! Poor things ! '
24865	24876	24854	24855	Miss Barfoot	212	' What can we possibly do for the older ones ? '
24877	24883	24885	24885	Rhoda	197	' They are excellent creatures , '
24887	24941	24885	24885	Rhoda	197	' kind , innocent women ; but useful for nothing except what they have done all their lives . The eldest ca n't teach seriously , but she can keep young children out of mischief and give them a nice way of speaking . Her health is breaking down , you can see . '
24942	24952	24854	24855	Miss Barfoot	212	' Poor woman ! One of the saddest types . '
24953	24966	24885	24885	Rhoda	197	' Decidedly . Virginia is n't quite so depressng but how childish ! '
24967	25002	24854	24855	Miss Barfoot	212	' They all strike me as childish . Monica is a dear little girl ; it seemed a great absurdity to talk to her about business . Of course she must find a husband . '
25003	25008	24885	24885	Rhoda	197	' I suppose so . '
25019	25035	24854	24855	Miss Barfoot	212	' My dear , after all we do n't desire the end of the race . '
25036	25043	25044	25044	Rhoda	197	' No , I suppose not , '
25050	25101	25044	25044	Rhoda	197	' A word of caution . Your zeal is eating you up . At this rate , you will hinder our purpose . We have no mission to prevent girls from marrying suitably only to see that those who ca n't shall have a means of living with some satisfaction . '
25102	25114	24854	24855	Miss Barfoot	212	' What chance is there that this girl will marry suitably ? '
25115	25139	25044	25044	Rhoda	197	' Oh , who knows ? At all events , there will be more likelihood of it if she comes into our sphere . '
25140	25155	24854	24855	Miss Barfoot	212	' Really ? Do you know any man that would dream of marrying her ? '
25156	25163	25044	25044	Rhoda	197	' Perhaps not , at present . '
25255	25262	25264	25265	Miss Nunn	197	' If she marry at all , '
25267	25310	25264	25265	Miss Nunn	197	' she will marry badly . The family is branded . They belong to the class we know so well with no social position , and unable to win an individual one . I must find a name for that ragged regiment . '
25318	25331	25311	25312	Miss Barfoot	212	' Rhoda , what comfort have you for the poor in spirit ? '
25332	25337	25352	25352	she	212	' None whatever , I 'm
25347	25347	25340	25340	My	0	'
25355	25374	25352	25352	she	212	' They have their religious faith , I suppose ; and it 's answerable for a good deal . '
25375	25388	25390	25392	the elder woman	924	' It would be a terrible responsibility to rob them of it , '
25402	25416	25352	25352	she	212	' It 's a terrible responsibility to do anything at all . But I 'm
25418	25422	25352	25352	she	212	' she laughed scornfully '
25433	25433	25395	25395	Rhoda	197	'
25446	25461	25462	25462	she	212	' I do n't think we can do without the spirit of that religion , '
25466	25526	25462	25462	she	212	' the essential human spirit . These poor women one ought to be very tender with them . I do n't like your " ragged regiment " phrase . When I grow old and melancholy , I think I shall devote myself to poor hopeless and purposeless women try to warm their hearts a little before they go hence . '
25527	25530	25532	25532	Rhoda	197	' Admirable ! '
25536	25550	25532	25532	Rhoda	197	' But in the meantime they cumber us ; we have to fight . '
25622	25632	25634	25635	the widow	934	' I am so glad you are back again , '
25653	25673	25638	25638	she	934	' I do so want to ask your advice about an interesting girl who has applied to me . I 'm
25699	25699	25692	25692	Winifred	227	'
25716	25727	25728	25728	she	227	' I do wish my aunt would n't exaggerate so , '
25744	25772	25736	25737	Mrs. Smallbrook	226	' I never said that I was favourably impressed . The girl protests far too much ; she has played on aunt 's weaknesses , I fear . '
25773	25779	25728	25728	she	227	' But who is she ? '
25780	25829	25736	25737	Mrs. Smallbrook	226	' Oh , some one who lost her character long ago , and lives , I should say , on charitable people . Just because I said that she must once have had a very nice face , aunt misrepresents me in this way it 's too bad . '
25830	25837	25838	25839	Miss Barfoot	212	' Is she an educated person ? '
25845	25851	25736	25737	Mrs. Smallbrook	226	' Not precisely well educated . '
25852	25860	25736	25737	Mrs. Smallbrook	226	' Of the lower classes , then ? '
25861	25877	25736	25737	Mrs. Smallbrook	226	' I do n't like that term , you know . Of the poorer classes . '
25878	25885	25888	25889	Miss Haven	227	' She never was a lady , '
25894	25905	25907	25908	the hostess	903	' Then I fear I can be of no use , '
25965	25985	25922	25923	Mrs. Smallbrook	226	' But surely you do n't limit your humanity , Miss Barfoot , by the artificial divisions of society . '
25986	25996	25998	25999	the hostess	903	' I think those divisions are anything but artificial , '
26004	26021	25998	25999	the hostess	903	' In the uneducated classes I have no interest whatever . You have heard me say so .
26022	26038	25922	25923	Mrs. Smallbrook	226	' Yes , but I can not think is n't that just a little narrow ? '
26039	26098	25998	25999	the hostess	903	' Perhaps so . I choose my sphere , that 's all . Let those work for the lower classes I must call them lower , for they are , in every sense , let those work for them who have a call to do so . I have none . I must keep to my own class . '
26099	26106	26108	26109	the widow	934	' But surely , Miss Nunn , '
26115	26136	26108	26109	the widow	934	' we work for the abolition of all unjust privilege ? To us , is not a woman a woman ? '
26137	26188	25998	25999	the hostess	903	' I am obliged to agree with Miss Barfoot . I think that as soon as we begin to meddle with uneducated people , all our schemes and views are unsettled . We have to learn a new language , for one thing . But your missionary enterprise is admirable . '
26189	26194	26196	26197	Mrs. Smallbrook	226	' For my part , '
26199	26220	26196	26197	Mrs. Smallbrook	226	' I aim at the solidarity of woman . You , at all events , agree with me , Winifred ? '
26221	26242	26244	26245	Miss Haven	227	' I really do n't think , aunt , that there can be any solidarity of ladies with servant girls , '
26254	26269	26252	26252	Rhoda	197	' Then I grieve that your charity falls so far below the Christian standard . '
26519	26522	26515	26520	the leader of a ' movement	3882	' movement , '
26653	26661	26662	26662	Thither	212	' at her school in Great Portland Street .
26973	27065	26955	26955	she	212	' trial , bade fair to develop noteworthy ability , of a sudden disappeared . She was without relatives in London , and Miss Barfoot 's endeavours to find her proved for several weeks very futile . Then came news of her ; she was living as the mistress of a married man . Every effort was made to bring her back , but the girl resisted ; presently she again passed out of sight , and now more than a year had elapsed since Miss Barfoot 's last interview with her .
27134	27146	27111	27111	she	212	' Here 's a letter I should like you to read . '
27147	27161	27111	27111	she	212	' Something that has been troubling you since morning , is n't it ? '
27162	27165	27111	27111	she	212	' Yes . '
27193	27199	27201	27203	the elder woman	924	' What do you advise ? '
27209	27225	27111	27111	she	212	' An answer in two lines with a cheque enclosed , if you see fit . '
27226	27234	27111	27111	she	212	' Does that really meet the case ? '
27235	27245	27111	27111	she	212	' More than meets it , I should say . '
27250	27272	27246	27247	Miss Barfoot	212	' I am doubtful . That is a letter of despair , and I ca n't close my ears to it . '
27273	27306	27111	27111	she	212	' You had an affection for the girl . Help her , by all means , if you feel compelled to . But you would hardly dream of taking her back again ? '
27307	27318	27246	27247	Miss Barfoot	212	' That 's the point . Why should n't I ? '
27319	27324	27326	27326	Rhoda	197	' For one thing , '
27335	27362	27326	27326	Rhoda	197	' you will never do any good with her . For another , she is n't a suitable companion for the girls she would meet here . '
27363	27396	27246	27247	Miss Barfoot	212	' I ca n't be sure of either objection . She acted with deplorable rashness , with infatuation , but I never discovered any sign of evil in her . Did you ? '
27397	27511	27326	27326	Rhoda	197	' Evil ? Well , what does the word mean ? I am not a Puritan , and I do n't judge her as the ordinary woman would . But I think she has put herself altogether beyond our sympathy . She was twenty - two years old no child and she acted with her eyes open . No deceit was practised with her . She knew the man had a wife , and she was base enough to accept a share of his attentions . Do you advocate polygamy ? That is an intelligible position , I admit . It is one way of meeting the social difficulty . But not mine . '
27512	27522	27246	27247	Miss Barfoot	212	' My dear Rhoda , do n't enrage yourself . '
27523	27530	27326	27326	Rhoda	197	' I will try not to . '
27531	27607	27246	27247	Miss Barfoot	212	' But I ca n't see the temptation to do so . Come and sit down , and talk quietly . No , I have no fondness for polygamy . I find it very hard to understand how she could act as she did . But a mistake , however wretched , must n't condemn a woman for life . That 's the way of the world , and decidedly it must n't be ours . '
27608	27619	27326	27326	Rhoda	197	' On this point I practically agree with the world . '
27620	27654	27246	27247	Miss Barfoot	212	' I see you do , and it astonishes me . You are going through curious changes , in several respects . A year ago you did n't speak of her like this . '
27655	27712	27326	27326	Rhoda	197	' Partly because I did n't know you well enough to speak my mind . Partly yes , I have changed a good deal , no doubt . But I should never have proposed to take her by the hand and let bygones be bygones . That is an amiable impulse , but anti - social . '
27713	27732	27246	27247	Miss Barfoot	212	' A favourite word on your lips just now , Rhoda . Why is it anti - social ? '
27733	27816	27326	27326	Rhoda	197	' Because one of the supreme social needs of our day is the education of women in self - respect and self - restraint . There are plenty of people men chiefly , but a few women also of a certain temperament who cry for a reckless individualism in these matters . They would tell you that she behaved laudably , that she was living out herself and things of that kind . But I did n't think you shared such views . '
27817	27986	27246	27247	Miss Barfoot	212	' I do n't , altogether . " The education of women in self - respect . " Very well . Here is a poor woman whose self - respect has given way under grievous temptation . Circumstances have taught her that she made a wild mistake . The man gives her up , and bids her live as she can ; she is induced to beggary . Now , in that position a girl is tempted to sink still further . The letter of two lines and an enclosed cheque would as likely as not plunge her into depths from which she could never be rescued . It would assure her that there was no hope . On the other hand , we have it in our power to attempt that very education of which you speak . She has brains , and does n't belong to the vulgar . It seems to me that you are moved by illogical impulses and certainly anything but kind ones . '
27993	28013	27326	27326	Rhoda	197	' You say she yielded to a grievous temptation . What temptation ? Will it bear putting into words ? '
28014	28023	28025	28026	Miss Barfoot	212	' Oh yes , I think it will , '
28033	28041	28029	28029	her	212	' She fell in love with the man .
28042	28047	27326	27326	Rhoda	197	' Fell in love ! '
28056	28067	28029	28029	her	212	' Oh , for what is n't that phrase responsible ! '
28068	28095	28029	28029	her	212	' Rhoda , let me ask you a question on which I have never ventured . Do you know what it is to be in love ? '
28120	28128	28129	28129	she	197	' I am a normal human being , '
28137	28147	28129	28129	she	197	' I understand perfectly well what the phrase signifies . '
28148	28167	27326	27326	Rhoda	197	' That is no answer , my dear . Have you ever been in love with any man ? '
28168	28176	28129	28129	she	197	' Yes . When I was fifteen . '
28177	28182	28184	28185	the other	462	' And not since , '
28193	28199	28188	28188	her	462	' No , not since ? '
28200	28206	28129	28129	she	197	' Thank Heaven , no ! '
28207	28252	28188	28188	her	462	' Then you are not very well able to judge this case . I , on the other hand , can judge it with the very largest understanding . Do n't smile so witheringly , Rhoda . I shall neglect your advice for once . '
28253	28268	28129	28129	she	197	' You will bring this girl back , and continue teaching her as before ? '
28269	28296	28188	28188	her	462	' We have no one here that knows her , and with prudence she need never be talked about by those of our friends who did . '
28297	28304	28129	28129	she	197	' Oh , weak weak weak ! '
28305	28313	28188	28188	her	462	' For once I must act independently . '
28314	28470	28129	28129	she	197	' Yes , and at a stroke change the whole character of your work . You never proposed keeping a reformatory . Your aim is to help chosen girls , who promise to be of some use in the world . This Miss Royston represents the profitless average no , she is below the average . Are you so blind as to imagine that any good will ever come of such a person ? If you wish to save her from the streets , do so by all means . But to put her among your chosen pupils is to threaten your whole undertaking . Let it once become known and it would become known that a girl of that character came here , and your usefulness is at an end . In a year 's time you will have to choose between giving up the school altogether and making it a refuge for outcasts . '
28485	28492	28493	28493	Rhoda	197	' Personal feeling is misleading you , '
28496	29032	28493	28493	Rhoda	197	' Miss Royston had a certain cleverness , I grant ; but do you think I did n't know that she would never become what you hoped ? All her spare time was given to novel - reading . If every novelist could be strangled and thrown into the sea we should have some chance of reforming women . The girl 's nature was corrupted with sentimentality , like that of all but every woman who is intelligent enough to read what is called the best fiction , but not intelligent enough to understand its vice . Love love love ; a sickening sameness of vulgarity . What is more vulgar than the ideal of novelists ? They wo n't represent the actual world ; it would be too dull for their readers . In real life , how many men and women fall in love ? Not one in every ten thousand , I am convinced . Not one married pair in ten thousand have felt for each other as two or three couples do in every novel . There is the sexual instinct , of course , but that is quite a different thing ; the novelists dare n't talk about that . The paltry creatures dare n't tell the one truth that would be profitable . The result is that women imagine themselves noble and glorious when they are most near the animals . This Miss Royston when she rushed off to perdition , ten to one she had in mind some idiot heroine of a book . Oh , I tell you that you are losing sight of your first duty . There are people enough to act the good Samaritan ; you have quite another task in life . It is your work to train and encourage girls in a path as far as possible from that of the husband - hunter . Let them marry later , if they must ; but at all events you will have cleared their views on the subject of marriage , and put them in a position to judge the man who offers himself . You will have taught them that marriage is an alliance of intellects not a means of support , or something more ignoble still . But to do this with effect you must show yourself relentless to female imbecility . If a girl gets to know that you have received back such a person as Miss Royston she will be corrupted by your spirit of charity corrupted , at all events , for our purposes . The endeavour to give women a new soul is so difficult that we ca n't be cumbered by side - tasks , such as fishing foolish people out of the mud they have walked into . Charity for human weakness is all very well in its place , but it is precisely one of the virtues that you must not teach . You have to set an example of the sterner qualities to discourage anything that resembles sentimentalism . And think if you illustrate in your own behaviour a sympathy for the very vice of character we are trying our hardest to extirpate ! '
29033	29040	29042	29043	Miss Barfoot	212	' This is a terrible harangue , '
29060	29094	29042	29043	Miss Barfoot	212	' I quite enter into your point of view , but I think you go beyond practical zeal . However , I will help the girl in some other way , if possible . '
29095	29101	29594	29595	Miss Barfoot	212	' I have offended you . '
29102	29112	29042	29043	Miss Barfoot	212	' Impossible to take offence at such obvious sincerity . '
29113	29125	29594	29595	Miss Barfoot	212	' But surely you grant the force of what I say ? '
29126	29234	29042	29043	Miss Barfoot	212	' We differ a good deal , Rhoda , on certain points which as a rule would never come up to interfere with our working in harmony . You have come to dislike the very thought of marriage and everything of that kind . I think it 's a danger you ought to have avoided . True , we wish to prevent girls from marrying just for the sake of being supported , and from degrading themselves as poor Bella Royston has done ; but surely between ourselves we can admit that the vast majority of women would lead a wasted life if they did not marry . '
29235	29255	29594	29595	Miss Barfoot	212	' I maintain that the vast majority of women lead a vain and miserable life because they do marry . '
29256	29302	29042	29043	Miss Barfoot	212	' Do n't you blame the institution of marriage with what is chargeable to human fate ? A vain and miserable life is the lot of nearly all mortals . Most women , whether they marry or not , will suffer and commit endless follies . '
29303	29332	29594	29595	Miss Barfoot	212	' Most women as life is at present arranged for them . Things are changing , and we try to have our part in hastening a new order . '
29333	29357	29042	29043	Miss Barfoot	212	' Ah , we use words in a different sense . I speak of human nature , not of the effect of institutions . '
29358	29378	29594	29595	Miss Barfoot	212	' Now it is you who are unpractical . Those views lead only to pessimism and paralysis of effort . '
29383	29420	29042	29043	Miss Barfoot	212	' I give in to your objection against bringing the girl back to work here . I will help her in other ways . It 's quite true that she is n't to be relied upon . '
29421	29451	29042	29043	Miss Barfoot	212	' Impossible to trust her in any detail of life . The pity is that her degradation ca n't be used as an object lesson for our other girls . '
29452	29554	29042	29043	Miss Barfoot	212	' There again we differ . You are quite mistaken in your ideas of how the mind is influenced . The misery of Bella Royston would not in the least affect any other girl 's way of thinking about the destiny of her sex . We must avoid exaggeration . If our friends get to think of us as fanatics , all our usefulness is over . The ideal we set up must be human . Do you think now that we know one single girl who in her heart believes it is better never to love and never to marry ? '
29555	29559	29561	29561	Rhoda	197	' Perhaps not , '
29573	29593	29567	29567	she	197	' But we know several who will not dream of marrying unless reason urges them as strongly as inclination . '
29598	29613	29594	29595	Miss Barfoot	212	' Pray , who ever distinguished in such a case between reason and inclination ? '
29614	29624	29626	29626	Rhoda	197	' You are most unusually sceptical to - day , '
29633	29706	29594	29595	Miss Barfoot	212	' No , my dear . We happen to be going to the root of things , that 's all . Perhaps it 's as well to do so now and then . Oh , I admire you immensely , Rhoda . You are the ideal adversary of those care - nothing and believe - nothing women who keep the world back . But do n't prepare for yourself a woeful disillusion . '
29707	29715	29717	29718	Miss Nunn	197	' Take the case of Winifred Haven , '
29720	29747	29717	29718	Miss Nunn	197	' She is a good - looking and charming girl , and some one or other will want to marry her some day , no doubt . '
29748	29787	29594	29595	Miss Barfoot	212	' Forgive my interrupting you . There is great doubt . She has no money but what she can earn , and such girls , unless they are exceptionally beautiful , are very likely indeed to remain unsought . '
29788	29807	29717	29718	Miss Nunn	197	' Granted . But let us suppose she has an offer . Should you fear for her prudence ? '
29808	29815	29817	29818	the other	462	' Winifred has much good sense , '
29820	30021	29817	29818	the other	462	' I think she is in as little danger as any girl we know . But it would n't startle me if she made the most lamentable mistake . Certainly I do n't fear it . The girls of our class are not like the uneducated , who , for one reason or another , will marry almost any man rather than remain single . They have at all events personal delicacy . But what I insist upon is , that Winifred would rather marry than not . And we must carefully bear that fact in mind . A strained ideal is as bad , practically , as no ideal at all . Only the most exceptional girl will believe it her duty to remain single as an example and support to what we call the odd women ; yet that is the most human way of urging what you desire . By taking up the proud position that a woman must be altogether independent of sexual things , you damage your cause . Let us be glad if we put a few of them in the way of living single with no more discontent than an unmarried man experiences . '
30022	30030	30032	30032	Rhoda	197	' Surely that 's an unfortunate comparison , '
30035	30139	30032	30032	Rhoda	197	' What man lives in celibacy ? Consider that unmentionable fact , and then say whether I am wrong in refusing to forgive Miss Royston . Women 's battle is not only against themselves . The necessity of the case demands what you call a strained ideal . I am seriously convinced that before the female sex can be raised from its low level there will have to be a widespread revolt against sexual instinct . Christianity could n't spread over the world without help of the ascetic ideal , and this great movement for woman 's emancipation must also have its ascetics . '
30140	30169	29817	29818	the other	462	' I ca n't declare that you are wrong in that . Who knows ? But it is n't good policy to preach it to our young disciples . '
30170	30178	30032	30032	Rhoda	197	' I shall respect your wish ; but '
30186	30190	30192	30194	the elder woman	924	' My dear , '
30197	30335	30192	30194	the elder woman	924	' believe me that the less we talk or think about such things the better for the peace of us all . The odious fault of working - class girls , in town and country alike , is that they are absorbed in preoccupation with their animal nature . We , thanks to our education and the tone of our society , manage to keep that in the background . Do n't interfere with this satisfactory state of things . Be content to show our girls that it is their duty to lead a life of effort to earn their bread and to cultivate their minds . Simply ignore marriage that 's the wisest . Behave as if the thing did n't exist . You will do positive harm by taking the other course the aggressive course . '
30336	30342	30351	30352	Miss Barfoot	212	' I shall obey you . '
30343	30349	30351	30352	Miss Barfoot	212	' Good , humble creature ! '
30354	30374	30351	30352	Miss Barfoot	212	' Come , let us be off to Chelsea . Did Miss Grey finish that copy for Mr. Houghton ? '
30375	30384	30351	30352	Miss Barfoot	212	' Yes , it has gone to post . '
30385	30415	30351	30352	Miss Barfoot	212	' Look , here 's a big manuscript from our friend the antiquary . Two of the girls must get to work on it at once in the morning . '
30658	30669	30670	30670	she	191	' I do n't know whether it 's worth while , '
30697	30702	30704	30704	Virginia	191	' Not worth while ? '
30706	30717	30704	30704	Virginia	191	' You do n't think it would be an improvement ? '
30718	30737	30670	30670	she	191	' Yes , I suppose it would . I shall see how I feel about it tomorrow morning . '
31005	31070	30956	30956	She	195	' waiting she recovered her self - command . She had not made a mistake ; even his features had been discernible as he turned towards her . Was this the first time that he had come to look at the place where she lived possibly to spy upon her ? She resented this behaviour , yet the feeling was confused with a certain satisfaction .
31156	31161	31214	31215	The other	462	' Who 's that ? '
31185	31194	31171	31172	The speaker	884	' You ? What are you doing here ? '
31195	31207	31171	31172	The speaker	884	' I wanted to see if some one was standing outside . '
31208	31213	31171	31172	The speaker	884	' You mean him ? '
31218	31300	31214	31215	The other	462	' I 've got a beastly headache . I could n't hold myself up , and I had to come home at eight o'clock . There 's such pains all down my back too . I sha n't stay at this beastly place much longer . I do n't want to get ill , like Miss Radford . Somebody went to see her at the hospital this afternoon , and she 's awfully bad . Well , have you seen him ? '
31301	31310	31171	31172	The speaker	884	' He 's gone . Good - night . '
31400	31430	31509	31510	the eldest	1039	' We have something very delightful to tell you . We do hope you gave notice to - day , as things are getting so bright in every direction . '
31454	31464	31466	31466	Virginia	191	' Mrs. Darby has found a place for Alice , '
31468	31494	31466	31466	Virginia	191	' We heard by the afternoon post yesterday . A lady at Yatton wants a governess for two young children . Is n't it fortunate ? '
31495	31506	31509	31510	the eldest	1039	' So delightfully convenient for what we were thinking of , '
31517	31524	31509	31510	the eldest	1039	' Nothing could have been better . '
31525	31532	31534	31534	Monica	195	' You mean about the school ? '
31537	31543	31544	31544	Virginia	191	' Yes , the school , '
31551	31584	31544	31544	Virginia	191	' Yatton is convenient both for Clevedon and Weston . Alice will be able to run over to both places and make enquiries , and ascertain where the best opening would be . '
31710	31717	31718	31720	their younger sister	1047	' Is it a good place ? '
31723	31768	31718	31720	their younger sister	1047	' Oh , pretty good . Only twelve pounds a year , but nice people , Mrs. Darby says . They want me at once , and it is very likely that in a few weeks I shall go with them to the seaside . '
31769	31776	31778	31778	Virginia	191	' What could have been better ? '
31780	31820	31778	31778	Virginia	191	' Her health will be established , and in half a year , or less , we shall be able to come to a decision about the great step . Oh , and have you given notice , darling ? '
31821	31827	31718	31720	their younger sister	1047	' Yes , I have . '
31911	31917	31919	31919	Virginia	191	' We thought at first , '
31921	32045	31919	31919	Virginia	191	' that when Alice had gone you might like to share my room ; but then the distance from Great Portland Street would be a decided objection . I might move , but we doubt whether that would be worth while . It is so comfortable with Mrs. Conisbee , and for the short remaining time Christmas , I should think , would be a very good time for opening . If it were possible to decide upon dear old Clevedon , of course we should prefer it ; but perhaps Weston will offer more scope . Alice will weigh all the arguments on the spot . Do n't you envy her , Monica ? Think of being there in this summer weather ! '
32046	32055	32056	32056	Monica	195	' Why do n't you go as well ? '
32059	32178	31919	31919	Virginia	191	' I ? And take lodgings , you mean ? We never thought of that . But we still have to consider expenditure very seriously , you know . If possible , I must find employment for the rest of the year . Remember how very likely it is that Miss Nunn will have something to suggest for me . And when I think it will be of so much practical use for me to see her frequently for a few weeks . Already I have learnt so much from her and from Miss Barfoot . Their conversation is so encouraging . I feel that it is a training of the mind to be in contact with them . '
32179	32188	32190	32190	Alice	185	' Yes , I quite share that view , '
32196	32234	32190	32190	Alice	185	' Virginia can reap much profit from intercourse with them . They have the new ideas in education , and it would be so good if our school began with the advantage of quite a modern system . '
32259	32283	32255	32255	she	195	' I wrote to Miss Barfoot last night , so I suppose I shall be able to move to those lodgings next Sunday . '
32344	32353	32354	32354	she	195	' Why are you here at this time ? '
32361	32376	32377	32377	He	350	' Not by chance . I had a hope that I might see you . '
32387	32404	32377	32377	He	350	' I must n't wait to talk now , Mr. Widdowson . It 's very late . '
32405	32417	32464	32464	Widdowson	217	' Very late indeed . It surprised me to see you . '
32418	32426	32377	32377	He	350	' Surprised you ? Why should it ? '
32427	32440	32464	32464	Widdowson	217	' I mean that it seemed so very unlikely at this hour . '
32441	32452	32377	32377	He	350	' Then how could you have hoped to see me ? '
32474	32504	32464	32464	Widdowson	217	' No , I did n't really think of seeing you , Miss Madden . I wished to be near the place where you were , that was all . '
32505	32515	32377	32377	He	350	' You saw me come out I dare say . '
32516	32519	32464	32464	Widdowson	217	' No . '
32520	32563	32377	32377	He	350	' If you had done , you would have known that I came to meet two ladies , my sisters . I walked with them to the station , and now I am going home . You seem to think an explanation necessary '
32564	32616	32464	32464	Widdowson	217	' Do forgive me ! What right have I to ask anything of the kind ? But I have been very restless since Sunday . I wished so to meet you , if only for a few minutes . Only an hour or two ago I posted a letter to you . '
32621	32645	32377	32377	He	350	' It was to ask you to meet me next Sunday , as we arranged . Shall you be able to do so ? '
32646	32648	32377	32377	He	350	' I 'm
32679	32679	32377	32377	He	350	'
32680	32696	32377	32377	He	350	' You are leaving ? You have decided to make the change you spoke of ? '
32697	32700	32377	32377	He	350	' Yes . '
32701	32714	32377	32377	He	350	' And will you tell me where you are going to live ? '
32715	32738	32377	32377	He	350	' In lodgings near Great Portland Street . I must say good - night , Mr. Widdowson . I must , indeed . '
32739	32747	32377	32377	He	350	' Please do give me one moment ! '
32748	32760	32377	32377	He	350	' I ca n't stay I ca n't good - night ! '
32935	32960	32917	32917	Widdowson	217	' In passing , I shall be able to point out to you the house which has been my home for about a year . '
33060	33149	33150	33151	MONICA MADDEN	195	' DEAR MR . WIDDOWSON I am very sorry that it will be impossible for me to see you next Sunday . All day I shall be occupied . My eldest sister is leaving London , and Sunday will be my last day with her , perhaps for a long time . Please do not think that I make light of your kindness . When I am settled in my new life , I hope to be able to let you know how it suits me . Sincerely yours ,
33153	33153	33150	33151	MONICA MADDEN	195	'
33201	33351	33197	33197	Widdowson	217	' DEAR MISS MADDEN My chief purpose in writing again so soon is to apologize sincerely for my behaviour on Tuesday evening . It was quite unjustifiable . The best way of confessing my fault is to own that I had a foolish dislike of your walking in the streets unaccompanied at so late an hour . I believe that any man who had newly made your acquaintance , and had thought as much about you as I have , would have experienced the same feeling . The life which made it impossible for you to see friends at any other time of the day was so evidently unsuited to one of your refinement that I was made angry by the thought of it . Happily it is coming to an end , and I shall be greatly relieved when I know that you have left the house of business .
33352	33463	33481	33482	EDMUND WIDDOWSON	217	' You remember that we are to be friends . I should be much less than your friend if I did not desire for you a position very different from that which necessity forced upon you . Thank you very much for the promise to tell me how you like the new employment and your new friends . Shall you not henceforth be at leisure on other days besides Sunday ? As you will now be near Regent 's Park , perhaps I may hope to meet you there some evening before long . I would go any distance to see you and speak with you for only a few minutes .
33464	33480	33197	33197	Widdowson	217	' Do forgive my impertinence , and believe me , dear Miss Madden . Ever yours ,
33484	33484	33481	33482	EDMUND WIDDOWSON	217	'
33523	33526	33518	33518	he	1079	' any distance '
33886	34000	33877	33884	the girl whose rooms she was to share	1089	' Miss Barfoot has spoken of you so favourably that I did not think it necessary to see you before consenting to what she suggested . Perhaps she has told you that I have my own furniture ; it is very plain , but , I think , comfortable . For the two rooms , with attendance , I pay eight and sixpence a week ; my landlady will ask eleven shillings when there are two of us , so that your share would be five - and - six . I hope you wo n't think this is too much . I am a quiet and I think a very reasonable person . '
34004	34009	33877	33884	the girl whose rooms she was to share	1089	' Mildred H. Vesper . '
34163	34169	34170	34170	Monica	195	' You are Miss Vesper ? '
34176	34208	34170	34170	Monica	195	' Yes very pleased to see you , Miss Madden . As London cabmen have a narrow view of their duties , I 'll help you to get the boxes in . '
34281	34286	34269	34269	She	235	' Will it do ? '
34287	34310	34269	34269	She	235	' Oh , very nicely indeed . After my quarters in Walworth Road ! But I feel ashamed to intrude upon you . '
34311	34324	34326	34327	the other	462	' I have been trying to find someone to share my rent , '
34338	34356	34326	34327	the other	462	' Miss Barfoot was full of your praises and indeed I think we may suit each other . '
34357	34371	34269	34269	She	235	' I shall try to be as little disturbance to you as possible . '
34372	34426	34326	34327	the other	462	' And I to you . The street is a very quiet one . Up above here is Cumberland Market ; a hay and straw market . Quite pleasant odours country odours reach us on market day . I am country - bred ; that 's why I speak of such a trifle . '
34427	34432	34434	34434	Monica	195	' So am I , '
34436	34442	34434	34434	Monica	195	' I come from Somerset . '
34443	34470	34326	34327	the other	462	' And I from Hampshire . Do you know , I have a strong suspicion that all the really nice girls in London are country girls . '
34519	34533	34506	34506	her	235	' Shall I ask the landlady to help me up with the luggage ? '
34534	34614	34506	34506	her	235	' You are rather pale , Miss Madden . Better let me see to that . I have to go down to remind Mrs. Hocking to put salt into the saucepan with the potatoes . She cooks for me only on Sunday , and if I did n't remind her every week she would boil the potatoes without salt . Such a state of mind is curious , but one ends by accepting it as a fact in nature . '
34735	34805	34715	34715	she	234	' She had made more of me than any one else could have done . When I first met her , three years ago , I was a simpleton ; I thought myself ill - used because I had to work hard for next to no payment and live in solitude . Now I should be ashamed to complain of what falls to the lot of thousands of girls . '
34806	34813	34815	34815	Monica	195	' Do you like Miss Nunn ? '
34817	34862	34715	34715	she	234	' Not so well as Miss Barfoot , but I think very highly of her . Her zeal makes her exaggerate a little now and then , but then the zeal is so splendid . I have n't it myself not in that form . '
34863	34866	34715	34715	she	234	' You mean '

Indeed , it is only just to see your face or your form as you walk along . When I have had my journey in vain I go back in misery . You are never out of my thoughts never . '
35848	35858	35737	35737	his	217	' I am sorry for that , Mr. Widdowson . '
35859	35885	35766	35766	he	217	' Sorry ? Are you really sorry ? Do you think of me with less friendliness than when we had our evening on the river ? '

35902	35981	35766	35766	he	217	' In one way unhappy , but as no one else ever had the power to . If you would let me meet you at certain times my restlessness would be at an end . The summer is going so quickly . Wo n't you come for that drive with me next Sunday ? I will be waiting for you at any place you like to appoint . If you could imagine what joy it would give me ! '

36201	36226	36227	36227	he	217	' Because you slaved and suffered there . If I had the power , I would destroy it every house . Many a time , '

36265	36301	36227	36227	he	217	' Not only that . It was n't fit for you to work in that way but the people about you ! I hated every face of man or woman that passed along the street . '

36311	36336	36227	36227	he	217	' I should hope not . Of course , I know you did n't . Why did you ever come to such a place ? '

36479	36511	36475	36475	he	217	' There 's nothing pretty or noticeable about it , and it is n't at all grandly furnished . My old housekeeper and one servant manage to keep it in order . '

Men in general do n't seem to care so long as they have lodgings that suit them I mean unmarried men . But I always wanted to live alone without strangers , that is to say . I told you that I am not very sociable . When I got my house , I was like a child with a toy ; I could n't sleep for satisfaction . I used to walk all over it , day after day , before it was furnished . There was something that delighted me in the sound of my footsteps on the staircases and the bare floors . Here I shall live and die , I kept saying to myself . Not in solitude , I hoped . Perhaps I might meet some one '
36744	36765	36727	36728	the girl	384	' You were telling me how the house pleased you . Have you still the same pleasure in living there ? '
36766	36787	36727	36728	the girl	384	' Yes . But lately I have been hoping I dare n't say more . You will interrupt me again . '
36788	36799	36727	36728	the girl	384	' Which way are we going now , Mr. Widdowson ? '
36800	36866	36727	36728	the girl	384	' To Streatham , then on to Carshalton . At five o'clock we will use our right as travellers , and get some innkeeper to make tea for us . Look , the sun is trying to break through ; we shall have a fine evening yet . May I , without rudeness , say that you look better since you left that abominable place . '
36867	36874	36727	36728	the girl	384	' Oh , I feel better . '
36897	36918	36727	36728	the girl	384	' I told you about my sister - in - law . Would you be willing to make her acquaintance ? '
36919	36932	36933	36933	Monica	195	' I do n't feel able to do that , Mr. Widdowson , '
37022	37076	37368	37369	the girl	384	' I ca n't part from you this evening without a word of hope to remember . You know that I want you to be my wife . Will you tell me if there is anything I can say or do to make your consent possible ? Have you any doubt of me ? '
37077	37085	37368	37369	the girl	384	' No doubt whatever of your sincerity . '
37086	37127	37368	37369	the girl	384	' In one sense , I am still a stranger to you . Will you give me the Opportunity of making things between us more regular ? Will you allow me to meet some friend of yours whom you trust ? '
37128	37137	37368	37369	the girl	384	' I had rather you did n't yet . '
37138	37150	37368	37369	the girl	384	' You wish to know still more of me , personally ? '

37173	37176	37177	37177	he	1152	' But , '
37180	37206	37177	37177	he	1152	' if we became acquaintances in the ordinary way , and knew each other 's friends , would n't that be most satisfactory to you ? '
37207	37244	37368	37369	the girl	384	' It might be . But you forget that so much would have to be explained . I have behaved very strangely . If I told everything to my friends I should leave myself no choice . '
37245	37287	37177	37177	he	1152	' Oh , why not ? You would be absolutely free . I could no more than try to recommend myself to you . If I am so unhappy as to fail , how would you be anything but quite free ? '
37288	37343	37368	37369	the girl	384	' But surely you must understand me . In this position , I must either not speak of you at all , or make it known that I am engaged to you . I ca n't have it taken for granted that I am engaged to you when I do n't wish to be . '
37359	37366	37368	37369	the girl	384	' I have behaved very imprudently , '
37560	37600	37601	37601	he	217	' Thank you for saying that for putting it so well , and so kindly for me . Let us disregard people , then . Let us go on seeing each other . I love you with all my soul '
37613	37646	37601	37601	he	217	' and your rules shall be mine . Give me a chance of winning you . Tell me if I offend you in anything if there 's anything you dislike in me . '

37873	38065	38254	38254	Rhoda	197	' DEAR COUSIN MARY , I hear that you are still active in an original way , and that civilization is more and more indebted to you . Since my arrival in London a few weeks ago , I have several times been on the point of calling at your house , but scruples withheld me . Our last interview was not quite friendly on your side , you will remember , and perhaps your failure to write to me means continued displeasure ; in that case I might be rejected at your door , which I should n't like , for I am troubled with a foolish sense of personal dignity . I have taken a flat , and mean to stay in London for at least half a year . Please let me know whether I may see you . Indeed I should like to . Nature meant us for good friends , but prejudice came between us . Just a line , either of welcome or " get thee behind me ! " In spite of your censures , I always was , and still am , affectionately yours ,
38069	38069	38066	38067	EVERARD BARFOOT	242	'
38077	38082	38084	38085	Miss Barfoot	212	' An impudent letter , '
38087	38092	38084	38085	Miss Barfoot	212	' Just like him . '
38093	38100	38070	38070	Rhoda	197	' Where does he appear from ? '
38101	38151	38084	38085	Miss Barfoot	212	' Japan , I suppose . " But prejudice came between us . " I like that ! Moral conviction is always prejudice in the eyes of these advanced young men . Of course he must come . I am anxious to see what time has made of him . '
38152	38166	38168	38168	Rhoda	197	' Was it really moral censure that kept you from writing to him ? '
38174	38193	38084	38085	Miss Barfoot	212	' Decidedly . I did n't approve of him at all , as I have frequently told you . '
38194	38205	38084	38085	Miss Barfoot	212	' But I gather that he has n't changed much . '
38206	38211	38213	38214	Miss Barfoot	212	' Not in theories , '
38216	38242	38213	38214	Miss Barfoot	212	' That is n't to be expected . He is far too stubborn . But in mode of life he may possibly be more tolerable . '
38243	38252	38254	38254	Rhoda	197	' After two or three years in Japan , '
38264	38326	38213	38214	Miss Barfoot	212	' He is about three - and - thirty , and before he left England I think he showed possibilities of future wisdom . Of course I disapprove of him , and , if necessary , shall let him understand that quite as plainly as before . But there 's no harm in seeing if he has learnt to behave himself . '
38588	38598	38600	38601	Miss Barfoot	212	' No one had told me of your return , '
38612	38632	38567	38567	his	242	' I fancy because no one knew . You were the first of my kinsfolk to whom I wrote . '
38633	38644	38765	38765	He	242	' Much honour , Everard . You look very well . '
38645	38670	38567	38567	his	242	' I am glad to be able to say the same of you . And yet I hear that you work harder than ever . '
38671	38682	38765	38765	He	242	' Who is the source of your information about me ? '
38683	38702	38567	38567	his	242	' I had an account of you from Tom , in a letter that caught me at Constantinople . '
38703	38734	38765	38765	He	242	' Tom ? I thought he had forgotten my existence . Who told him about me I ca n't imagine . So you did n't come straight home from Japan ? '
38746	38764	38765	38765	He	242	' No ; I loitered a little in Egypt and Turkey . Are you living quite alone ? '
38799	38816	38765	38765	He	242	' A lady lives with me Miss Nunn . She will join us in a moment . '
38817	38821	38822	38822	He	242	' Miss Nunn ? '
38825	38832	38822	38822	He	242	' A partner in your activity ? '
38833	38840	38765	38765	He	242	' She gives me valuable help . '
38841	38891	38822	38822	He	242	' I must hear all about it if you will kindly tell me some day . It will interest me greatly . You always were the most interesting of our family . Brother Tom promised to be a genius , but marriage has blighted the hope , I fear . '
38892	38901	38765	38765	He	242	' The marriage was a very absurd one . '
38902	38923	38822	38822	He	242	' Was it ? I feared so ; but Tom seems satisfied . I suppose they will stay at Madeira . '
38924	38951	38765	38765	He	242	' Until his wife is tired of her imaginary phthisis , and amuses herself with imagining some other ailment that requires them to go to Siberia . '
38952	38963	38964	38964	He	1168	' Ah , that kind of person , is she ? '
39191	39201	39203	39204	the hostess	903	' There shall be no forms , cousin Everard , '
39206	39212	39203	39204	the hostess	903	' Please to follow us . '
39370	39380	39381	39382	the hostess	903	' Have you heard of your friend Mr. Poppleton ? '
39385	39398	39381	39382	the hostess	903	' Poppleton ? Nothing whatever . I should like to see him . '
39399	39401	39381	39382	the hostess	903	' I 'm
39413	39413	39381	39382	the hostess	903	'
39443	39452	39454	39456	the young man	667	' Yet I should have suggested another explanation , '
39464	39471	39459	39459	his	667	' You never met Mrs. Poppleton ? '
39488	39595	39482	39482	he	667	' My friend Poppleton was one of the most delightful men perhaps the best and kindest I ever knew , and so overflowing with natural wit and humour that there was no resisting his cheerful influence . To the amazement of every one who knew him , he married perhaps the dullest woman he could have found . Mrs. Poppleton not only never made a joke , but could n't understand what joking meant . Only the flattest literalism was intelligible to her ; she could follow nothing but the very macadam of conversation had no palate for anything but the suet - pudding of talk . '
39621	39624	39625	39625	he	242	' Yes , '
39628	39895	39625	39625	he	242	' she was by birth a lady which made the infliction harder to bear . Poor old Poppleton ! Again and again I have heard him what do you think ? laboriously explaining jests to her . That was a trial , as you may imagine . There we sat , we three , in the unbeautiful little parlour for they were anything but rich . Poppleton would say something that convulsed me with laughter in spite of my efforts , for I always dreaded the result so much that I strove my hardest to do no more than smile appreciation . My laugh compelled Mrs. Poppleton to stare at me oh , her eyes I Thereupon , her husband began his dread performance . The patience , the heroic patience , of that dear , good fellow ! I have known him explain , and re - explain , for a quarter of an hour , and invariably without success . It might be a mere pun ; Mrs. Poppleton no more understood the nature of a pun than of the binomial theorem . But worse was when the jest involved some allusion . When I heard Poppleton begin to elucidate , to expound , the perspiration already on his forehead , I looked at him with imploring anguish . Why would he attempt the impossible ? But the kind fellow could n't disregard his wife 's request . Shall I ever forget her . " Oh yes I see " ? when obviously she saw nothing but the wall at which she sat staring . '
39896	39903	39905	39906	Miss Barfoot	212	' I have known her like , '
39909	39950	39625	39625	he	242	' I am convinced his madness did n't come from business anxiety . It was the necessity , ever recurring , ever before him , of expounding jokes to his wife . Believe me , it was nothing but that . '
39951	39957	39959	39959	Rhoda	197	' It seems very probable , '
39962	39976	39978	39979	the hostess	903	' Then there 's another friend of yours whose marriage has been unfortunate , '
39981	39998	39978	39979	the hostess	903	' They tell me that Mr. Orchard has forsaken his wife , and without intelligible reason . '
39999	40010	40012	40012	Barfoot	212	' There , too , I can offer an explanation , '
40015	40154	40012	40012	Barfoot	212	' though you may doubt whether it justifies him . I met Orchard a few months ago in Alexandria , met him by chance in the street , and did n't recognize him until he spoke to me . He was worn to skin and bone . I found that he had abandoned all his possessions to Mrs. Orchard , and just kept himself alive on casual work for the magazines , wandering about the shores of the Mediterranean like an uneasy spirit . He showed me the thing he had last written , and I see it is published in this month 's Macmillan . Do read it . An exquisite description of a night in Alexandria . One of these days he will starve to death . A pity ; he might have done fine work . '
40155	40173	39625	39625	he	242	' But we await your explanation . What business has he to desert his wife and children ? '
40174	40451	40012	40012	Barfoot	212	' Let me give an account of a day I spent with him at Tintern , not long before I left England . He and his wife were having a holiday there , and I called on them . We went to walk about the Abbey . Now , for some two hours I will be strictly truthful whilst we were in the midst of that lovely scenery , Mrs. Orchard discoursed unceasingly of one subject the difficulty she had with her domestic servants . Ten or twelve of these handmaidens were marshalled before our imagination ; their names , their ages , their antecedents , the wages they received , were carefully specified . We listened to a catalogue raisonne of the plates , cups , and other utensils that they had broken . We heard of the enormities which in each case led to their dismissal . Orchard tried repeatedly to change the subject , but only with the effect of irritating his wife . What could he or I do but patiently give ear ? Our walk was ruined , but there was no help for it . Now , be good enough to extend this kind of thing over a number of years . Picture Orchard sitting down in his home to literary work , and liable at any moment to an invasion from Mrs. Orchard , who comes to tell him , at great length , that the butcher has charged for a joint they have not consumed or something of that kind . He assured me that his choice lay between flight and suicide , and I firmly believed him . '
40470	40477	40465	40466	the latter	1187	' Why will men marry fools ? '
40491	40497	40499	40500	the hostess	903	' A most sensible question , '
40506	40511	40499	40500	the hostess	903	' Why , indeed ? '
40512	40520	40522	40522	Everard	242	' But a difficult one to answer , '
40530	40564	40525	40525	his	242	' Possibly , Miss Nunn , narrow social opportunity has something to do with it . They must marry some one , and in the case of most men choice is seriously restricted . '
40565	40571	40573	40573	Rhoda	197	' I should have thought , '
40579	40591	40576	40576	her	197	' that to live alone was the less of two evils . '
40592	40612	40525	40525	his	242	' Undoubtedly . But men like these two we have been speaking of have n't a very logical mind . '
40693	40700	40701	40702	Miss Barfoot	212	' It is as I expected , '
40714	40721	40701	40702	Miss Barfoot	212	' He has changed very noticeably . '
40722	40737	40738	40738	Rhoda	197	' Mr. Barfoot is n't quite the man your remarks had suggested to me , '
40741	40786	40738	40738	Rhoda	197	' I fancy he is no longer the man I knew . His manners are wonderfully improved . He used to assert himself in rather alarming ways . His letter , to be sure , had the old tone , or something of it . '
40787	40798	40800	40800	Rhoda	197	' I will go to the library for an hour , '
40808	40820	40800	40800	Rhoda	197	' Mr. Barfoot wo n't leave before ten , I suppose ? '
40821	40833	40806	40806	herself	197	' I do n't think there will be any private talk . '
40834	40842	40800	40800	Rhoda	197	' Still , if you will let me '
40855	40863	40864	40864	she	197	' What are you going to do ? '
40872	40898	40806	40806	herself	197	' To do ? You mean , how do I propose to employ myself ? I have nothing whatever in view , beyond enjoying life . '
40899	40904	40806	40806	herself	197	' At your age ? '
40905	40915	40806	40806	herself	197	' So young ? Or so old ? Which ? '
40916	40931	40806	40806	herself	197	' So young , of course . You deliberately intend to waste your life ? '
40932	40969	40806	40806	herself	197	' To enjoy it , I said . I am not prompted to any business or profession ; that 's all over for me ; I have learnt all I care to of the active world . '
40970	40979	40981	40982	Miss Barfoot	212	' But what do you understand by enjoyment ? '
40988	41130	40806	40806	herself	197	' Is n't the spectacle of existence quite enough to occupy one through a lifetime ? If a man merely travelled , could he possibly exhaust all the beauties and magnificences that are offered to him in every country ? For ten years and more I worked as hard as any man ; I shall never regret it , for it has given me a feeling of liberty and opportunity such as I should not have known if I had always lived at my ease . It taught me a great deal , too ; supplemented my so - called education as nothing else could have done . But to work for ever is to lose half of life . I ca n't understand those people who reconcile themselves to quitting the world without having seen a millionth part of it . '
41131	41150	40806	40806	herself	197	' I am quite reconciled to that . An infinite picture gallery is n't my idea of enjoyment . '
41151	41210	40806	40806	herself	197	' Nor mine . But an infinite series of modes of living . A ceaseless exercise of all one 's faculties of pleasure . That sounds shameless to you ? I ca n't understand why it should . Why is the man who toils more meritorious than he who enjoys ? What is the sanction for this judgment ? '
41211	41217	40806	40806	herself	197	' Social usefulness , Everard . '
41218	41278	40806	40806	herself	197	' I admit the demand for social usefulness , up to a certain point . But , really , I have done my share . The mass of men do n't toil with any such ideal , but merely to keep themselves alive , or to get wealth . I think there is a vast amount of unnecessary labour . '
41279	41303	40806	40806	herself	197	' There is an old proverb about Satan and idle hands . Pardon me ; you alluded to that personage in your letter . '
41304	41366	40806	40806	herself	197	' The proverb is a very true one , but , like other proverbs , it applies to the multitude . If I get into mischief , it will not be because I do n't perspire for so many hours every day , but simply because it is human to err . I have no intention whatever of getting into mischief . '
41380	41396	41398	41399	Miss Barfoot	212	' Your purpose is intensely selfish , and all indulged selfishness reacts on the character , '
41410	41458	40806	40806	herself	197	' My dear cousin , for anything to be selfish , it must be a deliberate refusal of what one believes to be duty . I do n't admit that I am neglecting any duty to others , and the duty to myself seems very clear indeed . '
41459	41467	41469	41470	the other	462	' Of that I have no doubt , '
41474	41484	41469	41470	the other	462	' I see that you have refined your arguments . '
41485	41494	41496	41496	Everard	242	' Not my arguments only , I hope , '
41499	41519	41496	41496	Everard	242	' My time has been very ill spent if I have n't in some degree , refined my nature . '
41520	41538	41469	41470	the other	462	' That sounds very well , Everard . But when it comes to degrees of self - indulgence '
41548	41628	41539	41539	She	212	' It comes to that , surely , with every man . But we certainly shall not agree on this subject . You stand at the social point of view ; I am an individualist . You have the advantage of a tolerably consistent theory ; whilst I have no theory at all , and am full of contradictions . The only thing clear to me is that I have a right to make the most of my life . '
41629	41636	41724	41725	Miss Barfoot	212	' No matter at whose expense ? '
41637	41702	41539	41539	She	212	' You are quite mistaken . My conscience is a tender one . I dread to do any one an injury . That has always been true of me , in spite of your sceptical look ; and the tendency increases as I grow older . Let us have done with so unimportant a matter . Is n't Miss Nunn able to rejoin us ? '
41703	41712	41724	41725	Miss Barfoot	212	' She will come presently , I think . '
41713	41723	41539	41539	She	212	' How did you make this lady 's acquaintance ? '
41730	41736	41738	41738	Everard	242	' She makes an impression , '
41740	41762	41738	41738	Everard	242	' A strong character , of course . More decidedly one of the new women than you yourself is n't she ? '
41763	41797	41724	41725	Miss Barfoot	212	' Oh , I am a very old - fashioned woman . Women have thought as I do at any time in history . Miss Nunn has much more zeal for womanhood militant . '
41798	41820	41738	41738	Everard	242	' I should delight to talk with her . Really , you know , I am very strongly on your side . '
41825	41834	41821	41822	Miss Barfoot	212	' Oh , sophist ! You despise women . '
41835	41877	41738	41738	Everard	242	' Why , yes , the great majority of women the typical woman . All the more reason for my admiring the exceptions , and wishing to see them become more common . You , undoubtedly , despise the average woman . '
41878	41887	41821	41822	Miss Barfoot	212	' I despise no human being , Everard . '
41888	41908	41738	41738	Everard	242	' Oh , in a sense ! But Miss Nunn , I feel sure , would agree with me . '
41909	41945	41821	41822	Miss Barfoot	212	' I am very sure Miss Nunn would n't . She does n't admire the feebler female , but that is very far from being at one with your point of view , my cousin . '
41952	41974	41946	41946	Everard	242	' I must get to understand her line of thought . You permit me to call upon you now and then ? '
41975	41988	41989	41990	Miss Barfoot	212	' Oh , whenever you like , in the evening . Except , '
41993	42003	41989	41990	Miss Barfoot	212	' Wednesday evening . Then we are always engaged . '
42004	42015	41946	41946	Everard	242	' Summer holidays are unknown to you , I suppose ? '
42016	42041	41989	41990	Miss Barfoot	212	' Not altogether . I had mine a few weeks ago . Miss Nunn will be going away in a fortnight , I think . '
42107	42118	42119	42119	he	242	' Wednesday is the forbidden evening , is it not ? '
42125	42134	42119	42119	he	242	' Yes , that is devoted to business . '
42190	42203	42175	42175	Rhoda	197	' You are sure you have n't exaggerated Mr. Barfoot 's failings ? '
42212	42233	42276	42277	Miss Barfoot	212	' I was a little indiscreet to speak of him at all . But no , I did n't exaggerate . '
42234	42237	42239	42240	the other	462	' Curious , '
42253	42263	42244	42244	she	462	' He hardly strikes one as that kind of man .
42264	42275	42276	42277	Miss Barfoot	212	' Oh , he has certainly changed a great deal . '
42292	42340	42276	42277	Miss Barfoot	212	' His means are very modest . I feel rather guilty before him ; his father bequeathed to me much of the money that would in the natural course have been Everard 's . But he is quite superior to any feeling of grudge on that score . '
42341	42349	42276	42277	Miss Barfoot	212	' Practically , his father disinherited him ? '
42350	42554	42276	42277	Miss Barfoot	212	' It amounted to that . From quite a child , Everard was at odds with his father . A strange thing , for in so many respects they resembled each other very closely . Physically , Everard is his father walking the earth again . In character , too , I think they must be very much alike . They could n't talk about the simplest thing without disagreeing . My uncle had risen from the ranks but he disliked to be reminded of it . He disliked the commerce by which he made his fortune . His desire was to win social position ; if baronetcies could be purchased in our time , he would have given a huge sum to acquire one . But he never distinguished himself , and one of the reasons was , no doubt , that he married too soon . I have heard him speak bitterly , and very indiscreetly , of early marriages ; his wife was dead then , but every one knew what he meant . Rhoda , when one thinks how often a woman is a clog upon a man 's ambition , no wonder they regard us as they do . '
42555	42581	42276	42277	Miss Barfoot	212	' Of course , women are always retarding one thing or another . But men are intensely stupid not to have remedied that long ago . '
42582	42885	42276	42277	Miss Barfoot	212	' He determined that his boys should be gentlemen . Tom , the elder , followed his wishes exactly ; he was remarkably clever , but idleness spoilt him , and now he has made that ridiculous marriage the end of poor Tom . Everard went to Eton , and the school had a remarkable effect upon him ; it made him a furious Radical . Instead of imitating the young aristocrats he hated and scorned them . There must have been great force of originality in the boy . Of course I do n't know whether any Etonians of his time preached Radicalism , but it seems unlikely . I think it was sheer vigour of character , and the strange desire to oppose his father in everything . From Eton he was of course to pass to Oxford , but at that stage came practical rebellion . No , said the boy ; he would n't go to a university , to fill his head with useless learning ; he had made up his mind to be an engineer . This was an astonishment to every one ; engineering did n't seem at all the thing for him ; he had very little ability in mathematics , and his bent had always been to liberal studies . But nothing could shake his idea . He had got it into his head that only some such work as engineering something of a practical kind , that called for strength and craftsmanship was worthy of a man with his opinions . He would rank with the classes that keep the world going with their sturdy toil : that was how he spoke . And , after a great fight , he had his way . He left Eton to study civil engineering . '
42894	42897	42899	42900	her friend	631	' Then , '
42902	43073	42899	42900	her friend	631	' came another display of firmness or obstinacy , whichever you like to call it . He soon found out that he had made a complete mistake . The studies did n't suit him at all , as others had foreseen . But he would have worked himself to death rather than confess his error ; none of us knew how he was feeling till long after . Engineering he had chosen , and an engineer he would be , cost him what effort it might . His father should n't triumph over him . And from the age of eighteen till nearly thirty he stuck to a profession which I am sure he loathed . By force of resolve he even got on to it , and reached a good position with the firm he worked for . Of course his father would n't assist him with money after he came of age ; he had to make his way just like any young man who has no influence . '
43074	43084	43086	43086	Rhoda	197	' All this puts him in quite another light , '
43088	43241	42276	42277	Miss Barfoot	212	' Yes , it would be all very well , if there were no vices to add to the picture . I never experienced such a revulsion of feeling as the day when I learnt shameful things about Everard . You know , I always regarded him as a boy , and very much as if he had been my younger brother ; then came the shock a shock that had a great part in shaping my life thenceforward . Since , I have thought of him as I have spoken of him to you as an illustration of evils we have to combat . A man of the world would tell you that I grossly magnified trifles ; it is very likely that Everard was on a higher moral level than most men . But I shall never forgive him for destroying my faith in his honour and nobility of feeling . '
43248	43258	43259	43259	she	197	' Perhaps even now you are unintentionally misleading me , '
43262	43271	43259	43259	she	197	' I have supposed him an outrageous profligate . '
43272	43285	43242	43242	Rhoda	197	' He was vicious and cowardly I ca n't say any more . '
43286	43303	43259	43259	she	197	' And that was the immediate cause of his father 's leaving him poorly provided for ? '
43304	43318	43242	43242	Rhoda	197	' It had much to do with it , I have no doubt . '
43319	43335	43259	43259	she	197	' I see . I imagined that he was cast out of all decent society . '
43336	43454	43242	43242	Rhoda	197	' If society were really decent , he would have been . It 's strange how completely his Radicalism has disappeared . I believe he never had a genuine sympathy with the labouring classes . And what 's more , I fancy he had a great deal of his father 's desire for command and social distinction . If he had seen his way to become a great engineer , a director of vast enterprises , he would n't have abandoned his work . An incredible stubbornness has possibly spoilt his whole life . In a congenial pursuit he might by this time have attained to something noteworthy . It 's too late now , I fear . '
43458	43466	43242	43242	Rhoda	197	' Does he aim at nothing whatever ? '
43467	43498	43242	43242	Rhoda	197	' He wo n't admit any ambition . He has no society . His friends are nearly all obscure people , like those you heard him speak of this evening . '
43499	43509	43511	43511	Rhoda	197	' After all , what ambition should he have ? '
43517	43563	43511	43511	Rhoda	197	' There 's one advantage in being a woman . A woman with brains and will may hope to distinguish herself in the greatest movement of our time that of emancipating her sex . But what can a man do , unless he has genius ? '
43564	43595	43242	43242	Rhoda	197	' There 's the emancipation of the working classes . That is the great sphere for men ; and Everard cares no more for the working classes than I do . '
43596	43606	43511	43511	Rhoda	197	' Is n't it enough to be free oneself ? '
43607	43623	43242	43242	Rhoda	197	' You mean that he has task enough in striving to be an honourable man ? '
43624	43634	43511	43511	Rhoda	197	' Perhaps . I hardly know what I meant . '
43649	43705	43242	43242	Rhoda	197	' You are right . It 's better to be a woman , in our day . With us is all the joy of advance , the glory of conquering . Men have only material progress to think about . But we we are winning souls , propagating a new religion , purifying the earth ! '
43710	43788	43706	43706	Rhoda	197	' My cousin is a fine specimen of a man , after all , in body and mind . But what a poor , ineffectual creature compared with you , Rhoda ! I do n't flatter you , dear . I tell you bluntly of your faults and extravagances . But I am proud of your magnificent independence , proud of your pride , dear , and of your stainless heart . Thank Heaven we are women ! '
43886	44083	43874	43874	he	1209	' DEAR MICKLETHWAITE , I am back in England , and ought before this to have written to you . I see you have just published a book with an alarming title , " A Treatise on Trilinear Co - ordinates . " My hearty congratulations on the completion of such a labour ; were you not the most disinterested of mortals , I would add a hope that it may somehow benefit you financially . I presume there are people who purchase such works . But of course the main point with you is to have delivered your soul on Trilinear Co - ordinates . Shall I run down to Sheffield to see you , or is there any chance of the holidays bringing you this way ? I have found a cheap flat , poorly furnished , in Bayswater ; the man who let it to me happens to be an engineer , and is absent on Italian railway work for a year or so . My stay in London wo n't , I think , be for longer than six months , but we must see each other and talk over old times , '
44109	44206	44087	44087	he	1210	' My DEAR BARFOOT , I also am in London ; your letter has been forwarded from the school , which I quitted last Easter . Disinterested or not , I am happy to tell you that I have got a vastly better appointment . Let me know when and where to meet you ; or if you like , come to these lodgings of mine . I do n't enter upon duties till end of October , and am at present revelling in mathematical freedom . There 's a great deal to tell . Sincerely yours ,
44210	44210	44207	44208	THOMAS MICKLETHWAITE	252	'

44352	44415	44349	44350	its occupant	1222	' and that 's all I care for . Two other lodgers in the house ; but they go to business every morning at half - past eight , and are in bed by ten at night . Besides , it 's only temporary . I have great things in view portentous changes ! I 'll tell you all about it presently . '
44575	44585	44586	44586	he	242	' And what is the appointment you have got ? '
44609	44672	44586	44586	he	242	' I shall have a hundred and fifty a year , and be able to take private pupils . On two hundred , at least , I can count , and there are possibilities I wo n't venture to speak of , because it does n't do to be too hopeful . Two hundred a year is a great advance for me . '
44673	44680	44682	44682	Everard	242	' Quite enough , I suppose , '
44685	44698	44586	44586	he	242	' Not not enough . I must make a little more somehow . '
44699	44711	44586	44586	he	242	' Hollo ! Why this spirit of avarice all at once ? '
44727	44756	44586	44586	he	242	' I must have more than two hundred . I should be satisfied with three hundred , but I 'll take as much more as I can get . '
44757	44827	44586	44586	he	242	' My revered tutor , this is shameless . I came to pay my respects to a philosopher , and I find a sordid worldling . Look at me ! I am a man of the largest needs , spiritual and physical , yet I make my pittance of four hundred and fifty suffice , and never grumble . Perhaps you aim at an income equal to my own ? '
44828	44867	44586	44586	he	242	' I do ! What 's four hundred and fifty ? If you were a man of enterprise you would double or treble it . I put a high value on money . I wish to be rich ! '
44868	44880	44586	44586	he	242	' You are either mad or are going to get married . '

44956	45038	44942	44943	my boy	1228	' I am renewing my youth . Nay , for the first time I am youthful . I never had time for it before . At the age of sixteen I began to teach in a school , and ever since I have pegged away at it , school and private . Now luck has come to me , and I feel five - and - twenty . When I was really five - and - twenty , I felt forty . '
45039	45052	45140	45140	Barfoot	242	' Well , what has that to do with money - making ? '
45053	45139	44942	44943	my boy	1228	' After Mick 's Algebra would follow naturally Mick 's Arithmetic , Mick 's Euclid , Mick 's Trigonometry . Twenty years hence I should have an income of thousands thousands ! I would then cease to teach resign my professorship that is to say , for of course I should be professor , and devote myself to a great work on Probability . Many a man has begun the best of his life at sixty the most enjoyable part of it , I mean . '
45177	45191	45140	45140	Barfoot	242	' Am I right or not ? You are going to get married ? '
45206	45249	45192	45192	Micklethwaite	252	' I do n't care to talk about it here . Let us go somewhere and eat together . I invite you to have dinner with me or lunch , as I suppose you would call it , in your aristocratic language . '
45250	45266	45192	45192	Micklethwaite	252	' No , you had better have lunch with me . Come to my club . '
45267	45280	45192	45192	Micklethwaite	252	' Confound your impudence ! Am I not your father in mathematics ? '
45281	45319	45192	45192	Micklethwaite	252	' Be so good as to put on a decent pair of trousers , and brush your hair . Ah , here is your Trilinear production . I 'll look over it whilst you make yourself presentable . '
45320	45334	45192	45192	Micklethwaite	252	' There 's a bad misprint in the Preface . Let me show you '
45335	45348	45192	45192	Micklethwaite	252	' It 's all the same to me , my dear fellow . '
45374	45385	45386	45386	he	252	' How do you suppose I got the thing published ? '
45390	45413	45386	45386	he	252	' Old Bennet , the Sheffield headmaster , is security for loss if the book does n't pay for itself in two years '

45626	45720	45576	45576	I	0	' Yes , I ought to tell you that . Why , about a year ago , I wrote an answer to a communication signed by a Big Gun in one of the scientific papers . It was a question in Probability you would n't understand it . My answer was printed , and the Big Gun wrote privately to me a very flattering letter . That correspondence led to my appointment ; the Big Gun exerted himself on my behalf . The fact is , the world is bursting with good nature . '

45945	45948	45949	45949	he	252	' Now , '
45953	45973	45949	45949	he	252	' I do n't mind telling you that your conjecture was right . I am going to be married . '
45974	45977	45979	45980	the other	462	' Well , '
45982	46002	45979	45980	the other	462	' you have reached the age of discretion . I must suppose that you know what you are about . '
46003	46060	45949	45949	he	252	' Yes , I think I do . The story is unexciting . I am not a romantic person , nor is my future wife . Now , you must know that when I was about twenty - three years old I fell in love . You never suspected me of that , I dare say ? '
46061	46065	45979	45980	the other	462	' Why not ? '
46066	46149	45949	45949	he	252	' Well , I did fall in love . The lady was a clergyman 's daughter at Hereford , where I had a place in a school ; she taught the infants in an elementary school connected with ours ; her age was exactly the same as my own . Now , the remarkable thing was that she took a liking for me , and when I was scoundrel enough to tell her of my feeling , she did n't reject me . '
46150	46157	45979	45980	the other	462	' Scoundrel enough ? Why scoundrel ? '
46158	46218	45949	45949	he	252	' Why ? But I had n't a penny in the world . I lived at the school , and received a salary of thirty pounds , half of which had to go towards the support of my mother . What could possibly have been more villainous ? What earthly prospect was there of my being able to marry ? '
46219	46228	45979	45980	the other	462	' Well , grant the monstrosity of it . '
46229	46341	45949	45949	he	252	' This lady a very little lower than the angels declared that she was content to wait an indefinite time . She believed in me , and hoped for my future . Her father the mother was dead sanctioned our engagement . She had three sisters , one of them a governess , another keeping house , and the third a blind girl . Excellent people , all of them . I was at their house as often as possible , and they made much of me . It was a pity , you know , for in those few leisure hours I ought to have been working like a nigger . '
46342	46347	45979	45980	the other	462	' Plainly you ought . '
46348	46508	45949	45949	he	252	' Fortunately , I left Hereford , and went to a school at Gloucester , where I had thirty - five pounds . How we gloried over that extra five pounds ! But it 's no use going on with the story in this way ; it would take me till to - morrow morning . Seven years went by ; we were thirty years old , and no prospect whatever of our engagement coming to anything . I had worked pretty hard ; I had taken my London degree ; but not a penny had I saved , and all I could spare was still needful to my mother . It struck me all at once that I had no right to continue the engagement . On my thirtieth birthday I wrote a letter to Fanny that is her name and begged her to be free . Now , would you have done the same , or not ? '
46509	46536	45979	45980	the other	462	' Really , I am not imaginative enough to put myself in such a position . It would need a stupendous effort , at all events . '
46537	46547	45949	45949	he	252	' But was there anything gross in the proceeding ? '
46548	46555	45979	45980	the other	462	' The lady took it ill ? '
46556	46662	45949	45949	he	252	' Not in the sense of being offended . But she said it had caused her much suffering . She begged me to consider myself free . She would remain Faithful , and if , in time to come , I cared to write to her again After all these years , I ca n't speak of it without huskiness . It seemed to me that I had behaved more like a scoundrel than ever . I thought I had better kill myself , and even planned ways of doing it I did indeed . But after all we decided that our engagement should continue . '
46663	46667	45979	45980	the other	462	' Of course . '
46668	46700	45949	45949	he	252	' You think it natural ? Well , the engagement has continued till this day . A month ago I was forty , so that we have waited for seventeen years . '
46709	46776	45979	45980	the other	462	' Two of Fanny 's sisters are dead ; they never married . The blind one Fanny has long supported , and she will come to live with us . Long , long ago we had both of us given up thought of marriage . I have never spoken to any one of the engagement ; it was something too absurd , and also too sacred . '
46791	46801	46803	46803	Micklethwaite	252	' Now , when are you going to marry ? '
46812	46816	45949	45949	he	252	' Probably never . '
46817	46873	46803	46803	Micklethwaite	252	' Then I think you will neglect a grave duty . Yes . It is the duty of every man , who has sufficient means , to maintain a wife . The life of unmarried women is a wretched one ; every man who is able ought to save one of them from that fate . '
46874	46900	45949	45949	he	252	' I should like my cousin Mary and her female friends to hear you talk in that way . They would overwhelm you with scorn . '
46901	46927	46803	46803	Micklethwaite	252	' Not sincere scorn , is my belief . Of course I have heard of that kind of woman . Tell me something about them . '
46940	46959	45949	45949	he	252	' I admire your old - fashioned sentiment , Micklethwaite . It sits well on you , and you 're
47083	47083	47066	47066	You	1250	'
47084	47095	47066	47066	You	1250	' That affair you told me about some years ago ? '
47096	47178	47066	47066	You	1250	' Chiefly that . I have a good mind to tell you the true story ; I did n't care to at the time . I accepted the charge of black - guardism ; it did n't matter much . My cousin will never forgive me , though she has an air of friendliness once more . And I suspect she had told her friend Miss Nunn all about me . Perhaps to put Miss Nunn on her guard Heaven knows ! '
47183	47197	47179	47179	He	1254	' Miss Nunn , I dare say , needs no protection against you . '
47198	47209	47210	47210	Everard	242	' I had an odd thought whilst I was there . '
47222	47300	47212	47212	his	242	' Miss Nunn , I warrant , considers herself proof against any kind of wooing . She is one of the grandly severe women ; a terror , I imagine , to any young girl at their place who betrays weak thoughts of matrimony . Now , it 's rather a temptation to a man of my kind . There would be something piquant in making vigorous love to Miss Nunn , just to prove her sincerity . '
47306	47324	47210	47210	Everard	242	' Unworthy of you , Barfoot . Of course you could n't really do such a thing . '
47325	47347	47210	47210	Everard	242	' But such women really challenge one . If she were rich , I think I could do it without scruple . '
47348	47358	47360	47361	the mathematician	1226	' You seem to be taking it for granted , '
47365	47376	47360	47361	the mathematician	1226	' that this lady would would respond to your lovemaking . '
47377	47499	47210	47210	Everard	242	' I confess to you that women have spoilt me . And I am rather resentful when any one cries out against me for lack of respect to womanhood . I have been the victim of this groundless veneration for females . Now you shall hear the story ; and bear in mind that you are the only person to whom I have ever told it . I never tried to defend myself when I was vilified on all hands . Probably the attempt would have been useless ; and then it would certainly have increased the odium in which I stood . I think I 'll tell cousin Mary the truth some day ; it would be good for her . '
47508	47624	47210	47210	Everard	242	' Well now , I was staying in the summer with some friends of ours at a little place called Upchurch , on a branch line from Oxford . The people were well - to - do Goodall their name and went in for philanthropy . Mrs. Goodall always had a lot of Upchurch girls about her , educated and not ; her idea was to civilize one class by means of the other , and to give a new spirit to both . My cousin Mary was staying at the house whilst I was there . She had more reasonable views than Mrs. Goodall , but took a great interest in what was going on .
47625	47719	47210	47210	Everard	242	' Now one of the girls in process of spiritualization was called Amy Drake . In the ordinary course of things I should n't have met her , but she served in a shop where I went two or three times to get a newspaper ; we talked a little with absolute propriety on my part , I assure you and she knew that I was a friend of the Goodalls . The girl had no parents , and she was on the point of going to London to live with a married sister .
47720	47894	47210	47210	Everard	242	' It happened that by the very train which took me back to London , when my visit was over , this girl also travelled , and alone . I saw her at Upchurch Station , but we did n't speak , and I got into a smoking carriage . We had to change at Oxford , and there , as I walked about the platform , Amy put herself in my way , so that I was obliged to begin talking with her . This behaviour rather surprised me . I wondered what Mrs. Goodall would think of it . But perhaps it was a sign of innocent freedom in the intercourse of men and women . At all events , Amy managed to get me into the same carriage with herself , and on the way to London we were alone . You foresee the end of it . At Paddington Station the girl and I went off together , and she did n't get to her sister 's till the evening .
47895	48011	47210	47210	Everard	242	' Of course I take it for granted that you believe my account of the matter . Miss Drake was by no means the spiritual young person that Mrs. Goodall thought her , or hoped to make her ; plainly , she was a reprobate of experience . This , you will say , does n't alter the fact that I also behaved like a reprobate . No ; from the moralist 's point of view I was to blame . But I had no moral pretentions , and it was too much to expect that I should rebuke the young woman and preach her a sermon . You admit that , I dare say ? '
48024	48245	47210	47210	Everard	242	' Amy was not only a reprobate , but a rascal . She betrayed me to the people at Upchurch , and , I am quite sure , meant from the first to do so . Imagine the outcry . I had committed a monstrous crime had led astray an innocent maiden , had outraged hospitality and so on . In Amy 's case there were awkward results . Of course I must marry the girl forthwith . But of course I was determined to do no such thing . For the reasons I have explained , I let the storm break upon me . I had been a fool , to be sure , and could n't help myself . No one would have believed my plea no one would have allowed that the truth was an excuse . I was abused on all hands . And when , shortly after , my father made his will and died , doubtless he cut me off with my small annuity on this very account . My cousin Mary got a good deal of the money that would otherwise have been mine . The old man had been on rather better terms with me just before that ; in a will that he destroyed I believe he had treated me handsomely . '
48246	48251	48253	48253	Micklethwaite	252	' Well , well , '
48255	48288	48253	48253	Micklethwaite	252	' every one knows there are detestable women to be found . But you ought n't to let this affect your view of women in general . What became of the girl ? '
48289	48329	47210	47210	Everard	242	' I made her a small allowance for a year and a half . Then her child died , and the allowance ceased . I know nothing more of her . Probably she has inveigled some one into marriage . '
48330	48335	48337	48338	the other	462	' Well , Barfoot , '
48346	48382	48337	48338	the other	462	' my Opinion remains the same . You are in debt to some worthy woman to the extent of half your income . Be quick and find her . It will be better for you . '
48383	48389	48391	48391	Everard	242	' And do you suppose , '
48399	48411	48391	48391	Everard	242	' that I could marry on four hundred and fifty a year .
48412	48418	48337	48338	the other	462	' Heavens ! Why not ? '
48419	48446	48391	48391	Everard	242	' Quite impossible . A wife might be acceptable to me ; but marriage with poverty I know myself and the world too well for that . '
48447	48450	48452	48453	the mathematician	1226	' Poverty ! '
48455	48462	48452	48453	the mathematician	1226	' Four hundred and fifty pounds ! '
48463	48470	48391	48391	Everard	242	' Grinding poverty for married people . '
48603	48625	48588	48589	Miss Barfoot	212	' I should n't wonder if that is the young man . Very flattering if he has come again so soon . '
48680	48691	48693	48693	Everard	242	' One of my reasons for coming to - day , '
48695	48706	48707	48707	he	242	' was to tell you a remarkable story . It connects '
48711	48765	48707	48707	he	242	' with our talk about the matrimonial disasters of those two friends of mine . Do you remember the name of Micklethwaite a man who used to cram me with mathematics ? I thought you would . He is on the point of marrying , and his engagement has lasted just seventeen years . '
48766	48777	48707	48707	he	242	' The wisest of your friends , I should say . '
48778	48799	48707	48707	he	242	' An excellent fellow . He is forty , and the lady the same . An astonishing case of constancy . '
48800	48810	48707	48707	he	242	' And how is it likely to turn out ? '
48811	48827	48828	48828	he	1267	' I ca n't predict , as the lady is unknown to me . But , '
48834	48924	48828	48828	he	1267	' I think it likely that they are tolerably well acquainted with each other . Nothing but sheer poverty has kept them apart . Pathetic , do n't you think ? I have a theory that when an engagement has lasted ten years , with constancy on both sides , and poverty still prevents marriage , the State ought to make provision for a man in some way , according to his social standing . When one thinks of it , a whole socialistic system lies in that suggestion . '
48925	48928	48930	48930	Rhoda	197	' If , '
48932	48948	48930	48930	Rhoda	197	' it were first provided that no marriage should take place until after a ten years '
48951	48951	48930	48930	Rhoda	197	'
48952	48955	48956	48956	Barfoot	242	' Yes , '
48967	49007	48960	48960	his	242	' That completes the system . Unless you like to add that no engagement is permitted except between people who have passed a certain examination ; equivalent , let us say , to that which confers a university degree . '
49008	49035	48930	48930	Rhoda	197	' Admirable . And no marriage , except where both , for the whole decennium , have earned their living by work that the State recognizes . '
49036	49046	49048	49049	Miss Barfoot	212	' How would that affect Mr. Micklethwaite 's betrothed ? '
49051	49063	48930	48930	Rhoda	197	' I believe she has supported herself all along by teaching . '
49064	49068	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' Of course ! '
49074	49096	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' And more likely than not , with loathing of her occupation . The usual kind of drudgery , was it ? '
49097	49114	48930	48930	Rhoda	197	' After all , there must be some one to teach children to read and write . '
49115	49189	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' Yes ; but people who are thoroughly well trained for the task , and who take a pleasure in it . This lady may be an exception ; but I picture her as having spent a lifetime of uncongenial toil , longing miserably for the day when poor Mr. Micklethwaite was able to offer her a home . That 's the ordinary teacher - woman , and we must abolish her altogether . '
49190	49198	49200	49200	Everard	242	' How are you to do that ? '
49203	49237	49200	49200	Everard	242	' The average man labours that he may be able to marry , and the average woman certainly has the same end in view . Are female teachers to be vowed to celibacy ? '
49238	49372	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' Nothing of the kind . But girls are to be brought up to a calling in life , just as men are . It 's because they have no calling that , when need comes , they all offer themselves as teachers . They undertake one of the most difficult and arduous pursuits as if it were as simple as washing up dishes . We ca n't earn money in any other way , but we can teach children ! A man only becomes a schoolmaster or tutor when he has gone through laborious preparation anything but wise or adequate , of course , but still conscious preparation ; and only a very few men , comparatively , choose that line of work . Women must have just as wide a choice . '
49373	49421	49200	49200	Everard	242	' That 's plausible , cousin Mary . But remember that when a man chooses his calling he chooses it for life . A girl can not but remember that if she marries her calling at once changes . The old business is thrown aside henceforth profitless . '
49422	49505	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' No . Not henceforth profitless ! There 's the very point I insist upon . So far is it from profitless , that it has made her a wholly different woman from what she would otherwise have been . Instead of a moping , mawkish creature , with in most instances a very unhealthy mind , she is a complete human being . She stands on an equality with the man . He ca n't despise her as he now does . '
49506	49510	49512	49512	Everard	242	' Very good , '
49521	49562	49515	49516	Miss Nunn	197	' I like that view very much . But what about the great number of girls who are claimed by domestic duties ? Do you abandon them , with a helpless sigh , to be moping and mawkish and unhealthy ? '
49563	49724	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' In the first place , there need n't be a great number of unmarried women claimed by such duties . Most of those you are thinking of are not fulfilling a duty at all ; they are only pottering about the house , because they have nothing better to do . And when the whole course of female education is altered ; when girls are trained as a matter of course to some definite pursuit ; then those who really are obliged to remain at home will do their duty there in quite a different spirit . Home work will be their serious business , instead of a disagreeable drudgery , or a way of getting through the time till marriage offers . I would have no girl , however wealthy her parent , grow up without a profession . There should be no such thing as a class of females vulgarized by the necessity of finding daily amusement . '
49725	49734	49737	49737	Everard	242	' Nor of males either , of course , '
49743	49752	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' Nor of males either , cousin Everard . '
49753	49763	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' You thoroughly approve all this , Miss Nunn ? '
49764	49805	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' Oh yes . But I go further . I would have girls taught that marriage is a thing to be avoided rather than hoped for . I would teach them that for the majority of women marriage means disgrace . '
49806	49822	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' Ah ! Now do let me understand you . Why does it mean disgrace ? '
49823	49847	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' Because the majority of men are without sense of honour . To be bound to them in wedlock is shame and misery . '
49862	49891	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' And you seriously think , Miss Nunn , that by persuading as many woman as possible to abstain from marriage you will improve the character of men ? '
49892	49969	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' I have no hope of sudden results , Mr. Barfoot . I should like to save as many as possible of the women now living from a life of dishonour ; but the spirit of our work looks to the future . When all women , high and low alike , are trained to self - respect , then men will regard them in a different light , and marriage may be honourable to both . '
49979	49990	49992	49993	Miss Barfoot	212	' We 'll go on with this discussion another time , '
49999	50009	49992	49993	Miss Barfoot	212	' Everard , do you know Somerset at all ? '
50010	50019	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' Never was in that part of England . '
50020	50047	49992	49993	Miss Barfoot	212	' Miss Nunn is going to take her holiday at Cheddar and we have been looking over some photographs of that district taken by her brother . '
50089	50124	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' I had no idea the scenery was so fine . Cheddar cheese has quite overshadowed the hills in my imagination . This might be a bit of Cumberland , or of the Highlands . '
50125	50136	50138	50138	Rhoda	197	' It was my playground when I was a child , '
50140	50147	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' You were born at Cheddar ? '
50148	50186	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' No ; at Axbridge , a little place not far off . But I had an uncle at Cheddar , a farmer , and very often stayed with him . My brother is farming there now . '
50187	50206	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' Axbridge ? Here is a view of the market - place . What a delightful old town ! '
50207	50258	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' One of the sleepiest spots in England , I should say . The railway goes through it now , but has n't made the slightest difference . Nobody pulls down or builds ; nobody opens a new shop ; nobody thinks of extending his trade . A delicious place ! '
50259	50275	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' But surely you find no pleasure in that kind of thing , Miss Nunn ? '
50276	50296	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' Oh yes at holiday time . I shall doze there for a fortnight , and forget all about the '
50304	50304	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	'
50305	50333	49070	49072	the other impatiently	1268	' I can hardly believe it . There will be a disgraceful marriage at this beautiful old church , and the sight of it will exasperate you . '
50338	50414	50334	50334	Rhoda	197	' Oh , it will be a marriage of the golden age ! Perhaps I shall remember the bride when she was a little girl ; and I shall give her a kiss , and pat her on the rosy cheek , and wish her joy . And the bridegroom will be such a good - hearted simpleton , unable to pronounce f and s. I do n't mind that sort of marriage a bit ! '
50440	50451	50453	50454	the latter	1187	' I must run down into that country some day , '
50564	50601	50554	50554	She	197	' Miss Barfoot , I am sorry to say , has gone to visit one of our girls who is ill . But I think she will very soon be back . Will you come in ? '
50602	50615	50616	50616	Rhoda	197	' Gladly . I had so counted on an hour 's talk . '
51099	51112	51087	51087	Everard	242	' Have you a formal society , with rules and so on ? '
51113	51122	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' Oh no ; nothing of the kind . '
51123	51137	51087	51087	Everard	242	' But you of course select the girls whom you instruct or employ ? '
51138	51142	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' Very carefully . '
51143	51156	51157	51157	he	242	' How I should like to see them all ! I mean , '
51164	51213	51157	51157	he	242	' it would be so very interesting . The truth is , my sympathies are strongly with you in much of what you said the other day about women and marriage . We regard the matter from different points of view , but our ends are the same . '
51223	51228	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' Are you serious ? '
51229	51283	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' Perfectly . You are absorbed in your present work , that of strengthening women 's minds and character ; for the final issue of this you ca n't care much . But to me that is the practical interest . In my mind , you are working for the happiness of men . '
51284	51287	51289	51289	Rhoda	197	' Indeed ? '
51299	51362	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' Do n't misunderstand me . I am not speaking cynically or trivially . The gain of women is also the gain of men . You are bitter against the average man for his low morality ; but that fault , on the whole , is directly traceable to the ignobleness of women . Think , and you will grant me this . '
51363	51378	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' I see what you mean . Men have themselves to thank for it . '
51379	51623	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' Assuredly they have . I say that I am on your side . Our civilization in this point has always been absurdly defective . Men have kept women at a barbarous stage of development , and then complain that they are barbarous . In the same way society does its best to create a criminal class , and then rages against the criminals . But , you see , I am one of the men , and an impatient one too . The mass of women I see about me are so contemptible that , in my haste , I use unjust language . Put yourself in the man 's place . Say that there are a million or so of us very intelligent and highly educated . Well , the women of corresponding mind number perhaps a few thousands . The vast majority of men must make a marriage that is doomed to be a dismal failure . We fall in love it is true ; but do we really deceive ourselves about the future ? A very young man may ; why , we know of very young men who are so frantic as to marry girls of the working class mere lumps of human flesh . But most of us know that our marriage is a pis aller . At first we are sad about it ; then we grow cynical , and snap our fingers at moral obligation . '
51624	51639	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' Making a bad case very much worse , instead of bravely bettering it . '
51640	51736	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' Yes , but human nature is human nature . I am only urging to you the case of average intelligent men . As likely as not so preposterous are our conventions you have never heard it put honestly . I tell you the simple truth when I say that more than half these men regard their wives with active disgust . They will do anything to be relieved of the sight of them for as many hours as possible at a time . If circumstances allowed , wives would be abandoned very often indeed . '
51740	51749	51737	51737	Rhoda	197	' You regret that it is n't done ? '
51750	51936	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' I prefer to say that I approve it when it is done without disregard of common humanity . There 's my friend Orchard . With him it was suicide or freedom from his hateful wife . Most happily , he was able to make provision for her and the children , and had strength to break his bonds . If he had left them to starve , I should have understood it , but could n't have approved it . There are men who might follow his example , but prefer to put up with a life of torture . Well , they do prefer it , you see . I may think that they are foolishly weak , but I can only recognize that they make a choice between two forms of suffering . They have tender consciences ; the thought of desertion is too painful to them . And in a great number of cases , mere considerations of money and the like keep a man bound . But conscience and habit detestable habit and fear of public opinion generally hold him . '
51937	51944	51946	51946	Rhoda	197	' All this is very interesting , '
51952	51972	51946	51946	Rhoda	197	' By - the - bye , under the head of detestable habit you would put love of children ? '
51976	52064	51214	51214	Rhoda	197	' That 's a motive I ought n't to have left out . Yet I believe , for most men , it is represented by conscience . The love of children would not generally , in itself , be strong enough to outweigh matrimonial wretchedness . Many an intelligent and kind - hearted man has been driven from his wife notwithstanding thought for his children . He provides for them as well as he can but , and even for their sakes , he must save himself . '
52093	52109	52110	52110	she	197	' There 's something in your way of putting it that I do n't like , '
52117	52165	52110	52110	she	197	' but of course I agree with you in the facts . I am convinced that most marriages are hateful , from every point of view . But there will be no improvement until women have revolted against marriage , from a reasonable conviction of its hatefulness . '
52166	52177	52178	52178	He	242	' I wish you all success most sincerely I do . '
52198	52289	52178	52178	He	242	' My own ideal of marriage involves perfect freedom on both sides . Of course it could only be realized where conditions are favourable ; poverty and other wretched things force us so often to sin against our best beliefs . But there are plenty of people who might marry on these ideal terms . Perfect freedom , sanctioned by the sense of intelligent society , would abolish most of the evils we have in mind . But women must first be civilized ; you are quite right in that . '
52317	52323	52324	52324	he	242	' How is your patient ? '
52327	52368	52300	52300	She	197	' A little better , I think . It is nothing dangerous . Here 's a letter from your brother Tom . Perhaps I had better read it at once ; there may be news you would like to hear . '
52392	52399	52401	52402	Miss Barfoot	212	' Yes , there is news , '
52405	52433	52401	52402	Miss Barfoot	212	' and of a disagreeable kind . A few weeks ago before writing , that is he was thrown off a horse and had a rib fractured . '
52434	52443	52369	52369	She	197	' Oh ? How is he going on ? '
52444	52520	52401	52402	Miss Barfoot	212	' Getting right again , he says . And they are coming back to England ; his wife 's consumptive symptoms have disappeared , of course , and she is very impatient to leave Madeira . It is to be hoped she will allow poor Tom time to get his rib set . Probably that consideration does n't weigh much with her . He says that he is writing to you by the same mail . '
52521	52526	52528	52528	Everard	242	' Poor old fellow ! '
52533	52541	52528	52528	Everard	242	' Does he complain about his wife ? '
52542	52599	52401	52402	Miss Barfoot	212	' He never has done till now , but there 's a sentence here that reads doubtfully . " Muriel , " he says , " has been terribly upset about my accident . I ca n't persuade her that I did n't get thrown on purpose ; yet I assure you I did n't . " '
52603	52626	52528	52528	Everard	242	' If old Tom becomes ironical , he must be hard driven . I have no great longing to meet Mrs. Thomas . '
52627	52670	52671	52671	He	242	' She 's a silly and a vulgar woman . But I told him that in plain terms before he married . It says much for his good nature that he remains so friendly with me . Read the letter , Everard . '
52675	52705	52671	52671	He	242	' H'm very kind things about me . Good old Tom ! Why do n't I marry ? Well , now , one would have thought that his own experience '
52742	52750	52752	52752	Everard	242	' I have been reading about Cheddar , '
52757	52776	52752	52752	Everard	242	' There 's a flower grows among the rocks called the Cheddar pink . Do you know it ? '
52777	52783	52784	52784	Rhoda	197	' Oh , very well , '
52787	52795	52784	52784	Rhoda	197	' I 'll bring you some specimens . '
52796	52805	52752	52752	Everard	242	' Will you ? That 's very kind . '
52806	52820	52822	52823	Miss Barfoot	212	' Bring me a genuine pound or two of the cheese , Rhoda , '
52826	52851	52752	52752	Everard	242	' I will . What they sell in the shops there is all sham , Mr. Barfoot like so much else in this world . '
52852	52892	52752	52752	Everard	242	' I care nothing about the cheese . That 's all very well for a matter - of - fact person like cousin Mary , but I have a strong vein of poetry ; you must have noticed it ? '
52898	52907	52908	52908	Everard	242	' You will really bring me the flowers ? '
52916	52925	52752	52752	Everard	242	' I will make a note of it , '

53218	53278	53297	53297	Rhoda	197	' Oh , I ca n't think that ! She has been so delighted with her progress each time I have seen her . No , I feel sure it 's only the results of what she suffered at Walworth Road . In a very short time we shall have her at work again , and brighter than ever . '

53359	53371	53372	53372	Rhoda	197	' Oh , I do n't like the thought of that . '
53382	53567	53376	53376	her	197	' Now could one have a better instance than this Madden family of the crime that middle - class parents commit when they allow their girls to go without rational training ? Of course I know that Monica was only a little child when they were left orphans ; but her sisters had already grown up into uselessness , and their example has been harmful to her all along . Her guardians dealt with her absurdly ; they made her half a lady and half a shop - girl . I do n't think she 'll ever be good for much . And the elder ones will go on just keeping themselves alive ; you can see that . They 'll never start the school that there 's so much talk of . That poor , helpless , foolish Virginia , alone there in her miserable lodging ! How can we hope that any one will take her as a companion ? And yet they are capitalists ; eight hundred pounds between them . Think what capable women might do with eight hundred pounds . '

Why have n't you made another appointment ? It is all I can do to keep from breaking my promise and coming to ask about you . Write at once , I implore you , my dearest . It 's no use telling me that I must not use these words of affection ; they come to my lips and to my pen irresistibly . You know so well that I love you with all my heart and soul ; I ca n't address you like I did when we first corresponded . My darling ! My dear , sweet , beautiful little girl '

56172	56210	56132	56132	Monica	195	' No ; that 's turning it very unkindly . I only said that after I had told you that I did love him . And I do love him . He has made me love him . '
56211	56229	55977	55977	Monica	195	' Then I have no right to say any more . I can only wish you happiness . '
56288	56295	56269	56269	She	195	' It is going , Milly . '
56296	56309	56269	56269	She	195	' Very well , dear . I have nothing more to say . '
56310	56322	56269	56269	She	195	' You give me up for lost . We shall see . '
56395	56401	56402	56402	Monica	195	' It 's all right , '
56413	56429	56402	56402	Monica	195	' I feel so relieved and so glad so happy now I have done it . '
56430	56437	56439	56444	the other , with a kiss	1340	' Good - night , dear , '
56509	56521	56479	56479	she	195	' Just a minute , my love ! Only a minute . '
56589	56595	56596	56596	Monica	195	' What a strange smell ! '
56604	56610	56596	56596	Monica	195	' It 's like brandy . '
56611	56680	56681	56681	She	191	' You notice it ? I have I was obliged to get to ask Mrs. Conisbee for I do n't want to alarm you , dear , but I felt rather faint . Indeed , I thought I should have a fainting fit . I was obliged to call Mrs. Conisbee But do n't think anything about it . It 's all over . The weather is very trying '
56736	56760	56726	56726	she	191	' I have brought you astonishing news . If you did n't faint before you 'll be very likely to do so now . '
56776	56804	56726	56726	she	191	' My nerves are in a shocking state to - day . It must be the weather . What can you have to tell me , Monica ? '
56805	56818	56726	56726	she	191	' I think I sha n't need to go on with typewriting . '
56819	56831	56832	56833	the other	462	' Why ? What are you going to do , child ? '
56837	56846	56726	56726	she	191	' Virgie I am going to be married . '
56885	56888	56889	56889	she	191	' Married ? '
56894	56900	56889	56889	she	191	' Who who is it ? '
56901	56931	56889	56889	she	191	' Some one you have never heard of . His name is Mr. Edmund Widdowson . He is very well off , and has a house at Herne Hill . '
56932	56937	56889	56889	she	191	' A private gentleman ? '
56938	57019	56889	56889	she	191	' Yes . He used to be in business , but is retired . Now , I am not going to tell you much more about him until you have made his acquaintance . Do n't ask a lot of questions . You are to come with me this afternoon to his house . He lives alone , but a relative of his , his sister - in - law , is going to be with him to meet us . '
57020	57083	56889	56889	she	191	' Oh , but it 's so sudden ! I ca n't go to pay a call like that at a moment 's notice . Impossible , darling ! What does it all mean ? You are going to be married , Monica ? I ca n't understand it . I ca n't realize it . Who is this gentleman ? How long '
57084	57107	56889	56889	she	191	' No ; you wo n't get me to tell you more than I have done , till you have seen him . '
57108	57133	56889	56889	she	191	' But what have you told me ? I could n't grasp it . I am quite confused . Mr. what was the name ? '
57176	57228	56889	56889	she	191	' Monica to be married ! A private gentleman a large fortune ! My darling , how shall I ever believe it ? Yet I felt so sure that the day would come . What will Alice say ? And Rhoda Nunn ? Have you have you ventured to tell her ? '
57229	57258	56889	56889	she	191	' No , that I have n't . I want you to do that You shall go and see them to - morrow , as it 's Sunday . '
57259	57282	56889	56889	she	191	' Oh , the delight ! Alice wo n't be able to contain herself . We always said the day would come . '
57283	57308	56889	56889	she	191	' You wo n't have any more anxieties , Virgie . You can take the school or not , as you like . Mr. Widdowson '
57309	57315	57317	57317	Virginia	191	' Oh , my dear , '
57323	57393	57317	57317	Virginia	191	' we shall certainly open the school . We have made up our minds ; that is to be our life 's work . It is far , far more than a mere means of subsistence . But perhaps we shall not need to hurry . Everything can be matured at our leisure . If you would only just tell me , darling , when you were first introduced ? '
57510	57517	57519	57520	the latter	1187	' Have you been here often ? '
57562	57569	57570	57570	Monica	195	' I 've never been inside , '
57574	57582	57570	57570	Monica	195	' Come ; we shall be unpunctual . '
57583	57593	57570	57570	Monica	195	' I do wish you would tell me , dear '
57594	57617	57570	57570	Monica	195	' I ca n't talk , Virgie . Try and keep quiet , and behave as if it were all quite natural . '
58015	58027	58028	58028	she	265	' Do you , by chance , know the Hodgson Bulls ? '
58066	58073	58054	58054	She	265	' I never heard of them , '
58079	58106	58054	58054	She	265	' No ? They live somewhere about here . I have to make a call on them . I suppose my coachman will find the place . '
58143	58153	58123	58124	Mrs. Luke	265	' Do you like this neighbourhood , Miss Madden ? '
58255	58269	58278	58278	she	265	' Perhaps you will come and see me some day , Miss Madden , '
58289	58313	58278	58278	she	265	' Edmund must bring you at some quiet time when we can talk . Very glad to have met you very glad indeed . '
58438	58446	58448	58448	Virginia	191	' But very rich , my dear , '
58454	58485	58448	58448	Virginia	191	' You can see that . I have met such people before ; they have a manner oh ! Of course Mr. Widdowson will take you to call upon her . '
58486	58502	58504	58504	Monica	195	' When nobody else is likely to be there ; that 's what she meant , '
58507	58562	58448	58448	Virginia	191	' Never mind , my love . You do n't wish for grand society . I am very glad to tell you that Edmund impresses me very favourably . He is reserved , but that is no fault . Oh , we must write to Alice at once ! Her surprise ! Her delight ! '
58608	58614	58615	58615	he	1390	' I had told you , '
58622	58675	58615	58615	he	1390	' that I see very little of her . I ca n't say that I like her , but she is a very difficult person to understand , and I fancy she often gives offence when she does n't at all mean it . Still , I hope you were not displeased ? '
58682	58691	58693	58693	her	195	' Shall you take me to see her ? '
58696	58747	58693	58693	her	195	' If you will go , dear . And I have no doubt she will be present at our wedding . Unfortunately , she 's my only relative ; or the only one I know anything about . After our marriage I do n't think we shall see much of her '
58748	58756	58758	58758	Monica	195	' No , I dare say not , '
59397	59412	59379	59379	She	265	' Well , it is n't quite so bad as I feared , Edmund . '
59413	59419	59379	59379	She	265	' What do you mean ? '
59420	59437	59379	59379	She	265	' Oh , she 's a decent enough little girl , I can see . But you 're
59471	59471	59463	59463	I	0	'
59472	59482	59484	59484	Widdowson	217	' I do n't relish this kind of talk , '
59487	59510	59484	59484	Widdowson	217	' In plain English , you supposed I was going to marry some one about whom I could n't confess the truth . '
59511	59529	59530	59531	The man	350	' Of course I did . Now come ; tell me how you got to know her . '
59554	59573	59544	59545	Mrs. Luke	265	' Yes , yes ; she managed it capitally . Clever little witch . Fetching eyes she has . '
59574	59584	59544	59545	Mrs. Luke	265	' If you sent for me to make insulting remarks '
59585	59598	59599	59601	a silly fellow	1423	' Bosh ! I 'll come to the wedding gaily . But you 're
59709	59709	59695	59695	you	350	'
59719	59758	59710	59710	Widdowson	265	' I see you do n't understand me in the least . I am going to marry because , for the first time in my life , I have met the woman whom I can respect and love . '
59759	59783	59710	59710	Widdowson	265	' That 's very nice and proper . But why should n't you respect and love a girl who belongs to good society ? '
59784	59791	59792	59792	he	350	' Miss Madden is a lady , '
59796	59803	59805	59806	the other	462	' Oh yes to be sure , '
59814	59837	59805	59806	the other	462	' Well , bring her here some day when we can lunch quietly together . I see it 's no use . You 're
59845	59845	59843	59843	Edmund	217	'
59846	59853	59855	59855	Widdowson	217	' Do you seriously tell me , '
59861	59884	59855	59855	Widdowson	217	' that there are ladies in good society who would have married me just because I have a few hundreds a year ? '
59885	59924	59843	59843	Edmund	217	' My dear boy , I would get together a round dozen in two or three days . Girls who would make good , faithful wives , in mere gratitude to the man who saved them from horrors . '
59925	59938	59855	59855	Widdowson	217	' Excuse me if I say that I do n't believe it . '
60094	60098	60099	60099	she	197	' And yet , '
60102	60113	60099	60099	she	197	' I have heard you speak severely of such marriages . '
60114	60122	60124	60125	Miss Barfoot	212	' It is n't the ideal wedlock , '
60127	60149	60124	60125	Miss Barfoot	212	' But so much in life is compromise . After all , she may regard him more affectionally than we imagine . '
60150	60208	60099	60099	she	197	' No doubt she has weighed advantages . If the prospects you offered her had proved more to her taste she would have dismissed this elderly admirer . His fate has been decided during the last few weeks . It 's probable that the invitation to your Wednesday evenings gave her a hope of meeting young men . '
60209	60218	60220	60221	Miss Barfoot	212	' I see no harm if it did , '
60225	60238	60220	60221	Miss Barfoot	212	' But Miss Vesper would very soon undeceive her on that point . '
60239	60262	60099	60099	she	197	' I hardly thought of her as a girl likely to make chance friendships with men in highways and by - ways . '
60263	60303	60220	60221	Miss Barfoot	212	' No more did I ; and that makes all the more content with what has come about . She ran a terrible risk , poor child . You see , Rhoda , nature is too strong for us . '
60310	60342	60099	60099	she	197	' And the delight of her sister ! It is really pathetic . The mere fact that Monica is to be married blinds the poor woman to every possibility of misfortune . '
60355	60396	60351	60351	Rhoda	197	' It strikes me that Mr. Widdowson must be of a confiding nature . I do n't think men in general , at all events those with money , care to propose marriage to girls they encounter by the way . '
60397	60408	60351	60351	Rhoda	197	' I suppose he saw that the case was exceptional . '
60409	60417	60351	60351	Rhoda	197	' How was he to see that ? '
60418	60452	60351	60351	Rhoda	197	' You are severe . Her shop training accounts for much . The elder sisters could never have found a husband in this way . The revelation must have shocked them at first . '
61015	61025	61026	61026	she	195	' It was very kind of you to come , '
61034	61043	61026	61026	she	195	' It all seems very silly , and I 'm
61064	61064	61054	61054	I	0	'
61290	61301	61302	61302	Everard	242	' You are thinking with regret of your old home , '
61313	61313	61302	61302	Everard	242	'
61314	61323	61284	61285	Miss Barfoot	212	' No . Why should you fancy that ? '
61324	61332	61302	61302	Everard	242	' Only because you seem rather sad . '
61333	61338	61284	61285	Miss Barfoot	212	' One is sometimes . '
61339	61362	61302	61302	Everard	242	' I like to see you with that look . May I remind you that you promised me some flowers from Cheddar ? '
61363	61370	61372	61373	the other	462	' Oh , so I did , '
61381	61399	61372	61373	the other	462	' I have brought them , scientifically pressed between blotting - paper . I 'll fetch them . '
61440	61448	61449	61449	he	242	' I left London for a while , '
61457	61558	61449	61449	he	242	' partly because I was afraid I had begun to bore you and Miss Nunn . Do n't you regret giving me permission to call upon you ? The fact is , I ca n't live without intelligent female society ; talking with women , as I talk with you two , is one of my chief enjoyments . I hope you wo n't get tired of my visits ; in fact , they are all but a necessity to me , as I have discovered since coming away . But it was fair that you should have a rest . '
61559	61565	61566	61567	Miss Barfoot	212	' Do n't be afraid , '
61576	61657	61566	61567	Miss Barfoot	212	' We are not at all weary of your conversation . The truth is , I like it much better than in the old days . You seem to me to have a healthier mind , and I am quite sure that the society of intelligent women we affect no foolish self - depreciation , Miss Nunn and I is a good thing for you . Come back to us as soon as you like ; I shall welcome you . '
61857	61860	61901	61901	Micklethwaite	252	' Fanny , '
61928	61932	61933	61933	he	252	' You scoundrel ! '
61950	62022	61945	61945	himself	242	' This is your doing . What the deuce do you mean ? A man who complains of poverty ! Well , it 's the greatest kindness I ever received , that 's all . Fanny will be devoted to you . With music in the house , our blind sister will lead quite a different life . Confound it ! I want to begin crying . Why , man , I 'm
62045	62045	62034	62034	I	0	'
62046	62070	61945	61945	himself	242	' That 's an audacious statement . When you told me that Miss Wheatley never allowed your birthday to pass without sending something . '
62071	62111	62034	62034	I	0	' Oh , Fanny ! But I have never thought of Fanny as a separate person . Upon my word , now I think of it , I never have . Fanny and I have been one for ages . '
62666	62677	62679	62679	Everard	242	' I will say good - bye to you here , '
62697	62733	62688	62690	The married man	1505	' You will do nothing of the kind . Fanny , he wants to be off at once ! You wo n't go until you have heard my wife play something on that blessed instrument . '
62839	62843	62845	62846	the sister	521	' Mr. Barfoot , '
62850	62897	62845	62846	the sister	521	' I have known your name for a long time , but I little thought to meet you on such a day as this , and to owe you such endless thanks . So long as I can have music I forget that I ca n't see .
62898	62907	62909	62909	Micklethwaite	270	' Barfoot is the finest fellow on earth , '
62911	62926	62909	62909	Micklethwaite	270	' At least , he would be if he understood Trilinear Co - ordinates . '
62927	62937	62939	62939	Everard	242	' Are you strong in mathematics , Mrs. Micklethwaite ? '
62941	62968	62845	62846	the sister	521	' I ? Oh dear , no ! I never got much past the Rule of Three . But Tom has forgiven me that long ago . '
62969	62996	62909	62909	Micklethwaite	270	' I do n't despair of getting you into plane trigonometry , Fanny . We will gossip about sines and co - sines before we die . '
63553	63573	63550	63550	her	197	' I have just called at the house , Miss Nunn . How is my cousin to - day ? '
63593	63602	63603	63603	she	197	' I believe Miss Barfoot is quite well , '
63612	63620	63574	63574	She	197	' But yesterday she was not so . '
63621	63631	63632	63632	He	1535	' A headache , or something of the kind . '
63657	63672	63574	63574	She	197	' She had to attend an inquest yesterday . Perhaps it rather upset her ? '
63673	63681	63636	63636	Rhoda	197	' Yes , I think it did . '
63781	63793	63845	63845	He	1535	' You also have been disturbed by it , Miss Nunn . '
63794	63799	63800	63800	she	197	' By the inquest ? '
63808	63814	63800	63800	she	197	' Indeed I have not . '
63815	63823	63845	63845	He	1535	' Did you know that poor girl ? '
63824	63829	63800	63800	she	197	' Some time ago . '
63830	63844	63845	63845	He	1535	' Then it is only natural that her miserable fate should sadden you . '
63859	63868	63869	63869	Rhoda	197	' It has no effect whatever upon me , '
63880	63897	63800	63800	she	197	' Forgive me if I say that I find it difficult to believe that . Perhaps you '
63902	63918	63898	63898	She	197	' I do n't easily forgive anyone who charges me with falsehood , Mr. Barfoot . '
63919	63959	63898	63898	She	197	' Oh , you take it too seriously . I beg your pardon a thousand times . I was going to say that perhaps you wo n't allow yourself to acknowledge any feeling of compassion in such a case . '
63960	63979	63898	63898	She	197	' I do n't acknowledge what I do n't feel . I will bid you good - afternoon . '
64019	64079	64080	64080	She	197	' You must , you shall forgive me ! I shall be too miserable if you dismiss me in this way . I see that I was altogether wrong . You know all the particulars of the case , and I have only read a brief newspaper account . I am sure the girl did n't deserve your pity . '
64113	64122	64080	64080	She	197	' You do pardon me , Miss Nunn ? '
64123	64140	64145	64145	Her	197	' Please do n't be foolish . I will thank you to let my hand go . '
64182	64192	64193	64193	he	242	' Will you have the kindness to tell me , '
64198	64209	64193	64193	he	242	' whether my cousin was suffering only from that cause ? '
64210	64216	64217	64217	she	197	' I ca n't say , '
64223	64237	64217	64217	she	197	' I have n't spoken with Miss Barfoot for two or three days . '
64246	64254	64238	64238	He	242	' You have n't seen each other ? '
64255	64272	64193	64193	he	242	' Miss Barfoot is angry with me . I think we shall be obliged to part . '
64273	64289	64238	64238	He	242	' To part ? What can possibly have happened ? Miss Barfoot angry with you ? '
64290	64433	64193	64193	he	242	' If I must satisfy your curiosity , Mr. Barfoot , I had better tell you at once that the subject of our difference is the girl you mentioned . Not very long ago she tried to persuade your cousin to receive her again to give her lessons at the place in Great Portland Street , as before she disgraced herself . Miss Barfoot , with too ready good - nature , was willing to do this , but I resisted . It seemed to me that it would be a very weak and wrong thing to do . At the time she ended by agreeing with me . Now that the girl has killed herself , she throws the blame upon my interference . We had a painful conversation , and I do n't think we can continue to live together . '
64456	64463	64464	64464	he	249	' Nor even to work together ? '
64467	64472	64193	64193	he	242	' It is doubtful . '
64486	64522	64473	64473	Rhoda	197	' You will somehow get over this difficulty , I am sure . Such friends as you and Mary do n't quarrel like ordinary unreasonable women . Wo n't you let me be of use ? '
64523	64526	64528	64528	Rhoda	197	' How ? '
64532	64544	64473	64473	Rhoda	197	' I shall make my cousin see that she is wrong . '
64545	64555	64473	64473	Rhoda	197	' How do you know that she is wrong ? '
64556	64580	64473	64473	Rhoda	197	' Because I am convinced that you must be right . I respect Mary 's judgment , but I respect yours still more . '
64588	64592	64593	64593	she	197	' That compliment , '
64596	64610	64593	64593	she	197	' pleases me less than the one you have uttered without intending it . '
64611	64616	64473	64473	Rhoda	197	' You must explain . '
64617	64655	64593	64593	she	197	' You said that by making Miss Barfoot see she was wrong you could alter her mind towards me . The world 's opinion would hardly support you in that , even in the case of men . '
64659	64688	64656	64656	Everard	242	' Now this is better . Now we are talking in the old way . Surely you know that the world 's opinion has no validity for me . '
64693	64704	64689	64689	She	197	' But , after all , is Mary wrong ? I 'm
64776	64776	64768	64768	I	0	'
64785	64793	64794	64794	he	1550	' Mary was fond of this girl ? '
64800	64806	64777	64777	Rhoda	197	' Yes , she was . '
64807	64854	64869	64869	his	1550	' Then her distress , and even anger , are natural enough . We wo n't discuss the girl 's history ; probably I know all that I need to . But whatever her misdoing , you certainly did n't wish to drive her to suicide . '
64860	64865	64866	64866	he	1550	' All the same , '
64873	64924	64866	64866	he	1550	' it turns out that you have practically done so . If Mary had taken the girl back that despair would most likely never have come upon her . Is n't it natural that Mary should repent of having been guided by you , and perhaps say rather severe things ? '
64925	64949	64869	64869	his	1550	' Natural , no doubt . But it is just as natural for me to resent blame where I have done nothing blameworthy . '
64950	64961	64866	64866	he	1550	' You are absolutely sure that this is the case ? '
64962	64976	64869	64869	his	1550	' I thought you expressed a conviction that I was in the right ? '
64995	65034	65064	65064	she	1551	' I have got into the way of always thinking so in questions of this kind . But perhaps you tend to err on the side of severity . Perhaps you make too little allowance for human weakness . '
65035	65054	65064	65064	she	1551	' Human weakness is a plea that has been much abused , and generally in an interested spirit . '
65093	65099	65100	65100	he	1550	' I , for one , '
65103	65147	65100	65100	he	1550	' ve ry seldom urge that plea , whether in my own defence or another 's . But it answers to a spirit we ca n't altogether dispense with . Do n't you feel ever so little regret that your severe logic prevailed ? '
65148	65154	65076	65076	she	1551	' Not the slightest regret . '
65176	65192	65100	65100	he	1550	' How I admire your consistency ! We others are poor halting creatures in comparison . '
65193	65197	65199	65199	Rhoda	197	' Mr. Barfoot , '
65202	65251	65199	65199	Rhoda	197	' I have had enough of this . If your approval is sincere , I do n't ask for it . If you are practising your powers of irony , I had rather you chose some other person . I will go my way , if you please . '
65723	65725	65731	65731	she	197	' home '
66029	66062	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' I have been thinking it over . It is n't right for me to remain here . Such an arrangement was only possible whilst we were on terms of perfect understanding . '
66063	66074	66075	66076	the other	462	' You must do what you think best , Rhoda , '
66087	66115	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' Yes , I had better take a lodging somewhere . What I wish to know is , whether you can still employ me with any satisfaction ? '
66116	66148	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' I do n't employ you . That is not the word to describe your relations with me . If we must use business language , you are simply my partner . '
66149	66176	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' Only your kindness put me into that position . When you no longer regard me as a friend , I am only in your employment . '
66177	66199	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' I have n't ceased to regard you as a friend . The estrangement between us is entirely of your making . '
66217	66224	66226	66227	the former	930	' I ca n't bear reproaches , '
66229	66240	66226	66227	the former	930	' least of all when they are irrational and undeserved . '
66241	66273	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' If I reproached you , it was in a tone which should never have given you offence . One would think that I had rated you like a disobedient servant . '
66274	66281	66283	66283	Rhoda	197	' If that had been possible , '
66290	66342	66283	66283	Rhoda	197	' I should never have been here . You said that you bitterly repented having given way to me on a certain occasion . That was unreasonable ; in giving way , you declared yourself convinced . And the reproach I certainly did n't deserve , for I had behaved conscientiously . '
66343	66357	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' Is n't it allowed me to disapprove of what your conscience dictates ? '
66358	66401	66283	66283	Rhoda	197	' Not when you have taken the same view , and acted upon it . I do n't lay claim to many virtues , and I have n't that of meekness . I could never endure anger ; my nature resents it . '
66402	66476	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' I did wrong to speak angrily , but indeed I hardly knew what I was saying . I had suffered a terrible shock . I loved that poor girl ; I loved her all the more for what I had seen of her since she came to implore my help . Your utter coldness it seemed to me inhuman I shrank from you . If your face had shown ever so little compassion '
66477	66483	66283	66283	Rhoda	197	' I felt no compassion . '
66484	66531	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' No . You have hardened your heart with theory . Guard yourself , Rhoda ! To work for women one must keep one 's womanhood . You are becoming you are wandering as far from the true way oh , much further than Bella did ! '
66532	66589	66283	66283	Rhoda	197	' I ca n't answer you . When we argued about our differences in a friendly spirit , all was permissible ; now if I spoke my thought it would be mere harshness and cause of embitterment . I fear all is at an end between us . I should perpetually remind you of this sorrow . '
66607	66614	66616	66617	Miss Barfoot	212	' Let us do nothing hastily , '
66619	66631	66616	66617	Miss Barfoot	212	' We have more to think of than our own feelings . '
66632	66687	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' I have said that I am quite willing to go on with my work , but it must be on a different footing . The relation between us can no longer be that of equals . I am content to follow your directions . But your dislike of me will make this impossible . '
66688	66717	66616	66617	Miss Barfoot	212	' Dislike ? You misunderstand me wretchedly . I think rather it is you who dislike me , as a weak woman with no command of her emotions . '
66730	66822	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' Rhoda , I shall be away all to - morrow ; I may not return to London until Monday morning . Will you think quietly over it all ? Believe me , I am not angry with you , and as for disliking you what nonsense are we talking ! But I ca n't regret that I let you see how painfully your behaviour impressed me . That hardness is not natural to you . You have encouraged yourself in it , and you are warping a very noble character . '
66823	66839	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' I wish only to be honest . Where you felt compassion I felt indignation . '
66840	66882	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' Yes ; we have gone through all that . The indignation was a forced , exaggerated sentiment . You ca n't see it in that light perhaps . But try to imagine for a moment that Bella had been your sister '
66883	66892	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' That is confusing the point at issue , '
66897	66980	66893	66893	Rhoda	197	' Have I ever denied the force of such feelings ? My grief would have blinded me to all larger considerations , of course . But she was happily not my sister , and I remained free to speak the simple truth about her case . It is n't personal feeling that directs a great movement in civilization . If you were right , I also was right . You should have recognized the inevitable discord of our Opinions at that moment . '
66981	66990	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' It did n't seem to me inevitable . '
66991	67004	66893	66893	Rhoda	197	' I should have despised myself if I could have affected sympathy . '
67005	67009	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' Affected yes . '
67010	67041	66893	66893	Rhoda	197	' Or have really felt it . That would have meant that I did not know myself . I should never again have dared to speak on any grave subject . '
67047	67135	66021	66021	Rhoda	197	' How young you are ! Oh , there is far more than ten years between our ages , Rhoda ! In spirit you are a young girl , and I an old woman . No , no ; we will not quarrel . Your companionship is far too precious to me , and I dare to think that mine is not without value for you . Wait till my grief has had its course ; then I shall be more reasonable and do you more justice . '
67231	67237	67181	67181	Rhoda	197	' Woman as an Invader . '
67453	67527	67539	67539	her	212	' They will tell you that , in entering the commercial world , you not only unsex yourselves , but do a grievous wrong to the numberless men struggling hard for bare sustenance . You reduce salaries , you press into an already overcrowded field , you injure even your own sex by making it impossible for men to marry , who , if they earned enough , would be supporting a wife . '
67680	67806	67640	67641	Miss Barfoot	212	' They point to half a dozen occupations which are deemed strictly suitable for women . Why do n't we confine ourselves to this ground ? Why do n't I encourage girls to become governesses , hospital nurses , and so on ? You think I ought to reply that already there are too many applicants for such places . It would be true , but I do n't care to make use of the argument , which at once involves us in a debate with the out - crowded clerk . No ; to put the truth in a few words , I am not chiefly anxious that you should earn money , but that women in general shall become rational and responsible human beings .
67807	67947	67640	67641	Miss Barfoot	212	' Follow me carefully . A governess , a nurse , may be the most admirable of women . I will dissuade no one from following those careers who is distinctly fitted for them . But these are only a few out of the vast number of girls who must , if they are not to be despicable persons , somehow find serious work . Because I myself have had an education in clerkship , and have most capacity for such employment , I look about for girls of like mind , and do my best to prepare them for work in offices . And here I must become emphatic once more I am glad to have entered on this course . I am glad that I can show girls the way to a career which my opponents call unwomanly .
67948	68204	67640	67641	Miss Barfoot	212	' Now see why . Womanly and womanish are two very different words ; but the latter , as the world uses it , has become practically synonymous with the former . A womanly occupation means , practically , an occupation that a man disdains . And here is the root of the matter . I repeat that I am not first of all anxious to keep you supplied with daily bread . I am a troublesome , aggressive , revolutionary person . I want to do away with that common confusion of the words womanly and womanish , and I see very clearly that this can only be effected by an armed movement , an invasion by women of the spheres which men have always forbidden us to enter . I am strenuously opposed to that view of us set forth in such charming language by Mr. Ruskin for it tells on the side of those men who think and speak of us in a way the reverse of charming . Were we living in an ideal world , I think women would not go to sit all day in offices . But the fact is that we live in a world as far from ideal as can be conceived . We live in a time of warfare , of revolt . If woman is no longer to be womanish , but a human being of powers and responsibilities , she must become militant , defiant . She must push her claims to the extremity .
68205	68347	67640	67641	Miss Barfoot	212	' An excellent governess , a perfect hospital nurse , do work which is invaluable ; but for our cause of emancipation they are no good nay , they are harmful . Men point to them , and say , Imitate these , keep to your proper world . Our proper world is the world of intelligence , of honest effort , of moral strength . The old types of womanly perfection are no longer helpful to us . Like the Church service , which to all but one person in a thousand has become meaningless gabble by dint of repetition , these types have lost their effect . They are no longer educational . We have to ask ourselves , What course of training will wake women up , make them conscious of their souls , startle them into healthy activity ?
68348	68477	67640	67641	Miss Barfoot	212	' It must be something new , something free from the reproach of womanliness . I do n't care whether we crowd out the men or not . I do n't care what results , if only women are made strong and self - reliant and nobly independent ! The world must look to its concerns . Most likely we shall have a revolution in the social order greater than any that yet seems possible . Let it come , and let us help its coming . When I think of the contemptible wretchedness of women enslaved by custom , by their weakness , by their desires , I am ready to cry , Let the world perish in tumult rather than things go on in this way ! '
68511	68831	68506	68506	they	1600	' Our abusive correspondent shall do as best he can . He suffers for the folly of men in all ages . We ca n't help it . It is very far from our wish to cause hardship to any one , but we ourselves are escaping from a hardship that has become intolerable . We are educating ourselves . There must be a new type of woman , active in every sphere of life : a new worker out in the world , a new ruler of the home . Of the old ideal virtues we can retain many , but we have to add to them those which have been thought appropriate only in men . Let a woman be gentle , but at the same time let her be strong ; let her be pure of heart , but none the less wise and instructed . Because we have to set an example to the sleepy of our sex , we must carry on an active warfare must be invaders . Whether woman is the equal of man I neither know nor care . We are not his equal in size , in weight , in muscle , and , for all I can say , we may have less power of brain . That has nothing to do with it . Enough for us to know that our natural growth has been stunted . The mass of women have always been paltry creatures , and their paltriness has proved a curse to men . So , if you like to put it in this way , we are working for the advantage of men as well as for our own . Let the responsibility for disorder rest on those who have made us despise our old selves . At any cost at any cost we will free ourselves from the heritage of weakness and contempt ! '
68898	68904	68885	68885	She	197	' It was very good . '
68905	68913	68914	68915	Miss Barfoot	212	' I thought it would please you . '
68922	68945	68914	68915	Miss Barfoot	212	' It was addressed to you . It seemed to me that you had forgotten how I really thought about these things . '
68946	68954	68955	68955	Rhoda	197	' I have been ill - tempered , '
68958	68966	68955	68955	Rhoda	197	' Obstinacy is one of my faults . '
68967	68971	68914	68915	Miss Barfoot	212	' It is . '
68976	68980	68982	68982	Rhoda	197	' I believe , '
68984	69004	68982	68982	Rhoda	197	' that I ought to ask your pardon . Right or wrong , I behaved in an unmannerly way . '
69005	69013	68955	68955	Rhoda	197	' Yes , I think you did . '
69024	69033	69035	69036	Miss Barfoot	212	' And there 's the last of it , '
69038	69046	69035	69036	Miss Barfoot	212	' Let us kiss and be friends . '
69116	69123	69111	69112	the hostess	903	' Not at home this evening ? '
69124	69135	69111	69112	the hostess	903	' Busy with some kind of study , I think . '
69174	69191	69192	69192	he	1604	' That was a very unpleasant affair that I saw your name connected with last week , '
69196	69210	69243	69244	Miss Barfoot	212	' It made me very miserable ill indeed for a day or two . '
69211	69221	69243	69244	Miss Barfoot	212	' That was why you could n't see me ? '
69222	69225	69243	69244	Miss Barfoot	212	' Yes . '
69226	69242	69243	69244	Miss Barfoot	212	' But in your reply to my note you made no mention of the circumstances . '
69271	69275	69277	69277	Everard	242	' No doubt , '
69283	69296	69277	69277	Everard	242	' you refrained out of delicacy on my account , I mean . '
69297	69304	69243	69244	Miss Barfoot	212	' Need we talk of it ? '
69305	69337	69277	69277	Everard	242	' For a moment , please . You are very friendly with me nowadays , but I suppose your estimate of my character remains very much the same as years ago ? '
69338	69347	69243	69244	Miss Barfoot	212	' What is the use of such questions ? '
69348	69365	69277	69277	Everard	242	' I ask for a distinct purpose . You ca n't regard me with any respect ? '
69366	69404	69243	69244	Miss Barfoot	212	' To tell you the truth , Everard , I know nothing about you . I have no wish to revive disagreeable memories , and I think it quite possible that you may be worthy of respect . '
69405	69432	69277	69277	Everard	242	' So far so good . Now , in justice , please answer me another question . How have you spoken of me to Miss Nunn ? '
69433	69439	69243	69244	Miss Barfoot	212	' How can it matter ? '
69440	69456	69277	69277	Everard	242	' It matters a good deal . Have you told her any scandal about me ? '
69457	69463	69243	69244	Miss Barfoot	212	' Yes , I have . '
69471	69480	69481	69481	she	1609	' I spoke to Miss Nunn about you , '
69484	69507	69481	69481	she	1609	' before I thought of your coming here . Frankly , I used you as an illustration of the evils I abominate . '
69508	69522	69524	69524	Everard	242	' You are a courageous and plain - spoken woman , cousin Mary , '
69530	69540	69524	69524	Everard	242	' Could n't you have found some other example ? '
69546	69549	69550	69550	he	242	' So , '
69553	69563	69550	69550	he	242	' Miss Nunn regards me as a proved scoundrel ? '
69564	69588	69481	69481	she	1609	' I never told her the story . I made known the general grounds of my dissatisfaction with you , that was all . '
69589	69597	69550	69550	he	242	' Come , that 's something . I 'm
69611	69611	69599	69599	you	242	'

69616	69621	69623	69623	Everard	242	' Yes , fiction , '
69626	69705	69623	69623	Everard	242	' I am not going into details ; the thing 's over and done with , and I chose my course at the time . But it 's as well to let you know that my behaviour was grossly misrepresented . In using me to point a moral you were grievously astray . I shall say no more . Ii you can believe me , do ; if you ca n't , dismiss the matter from your mind . '
70198	70212	70213	70213	she	212	' We went to hear the new opera at the Savoy last night , '
70226	70237	70213	70213	she	212	' Did you ? Miss Nunn and I were there . '
70247	70252	70253	70253	he	242	' Is it possible ? '
70256	70263	70253	70253	he	242	' You were at the Savoy ? '
70264	70282	70331	70331	her	1630	' Where is the impossibility ? Why should n't Miss Nunn and I go to the theatre ? '
70283	70295	70253	70253	he	242	' I appeal to Mrs. Widdowson . She also was astonished . '
70296	70306	70308	70310	the younger lady	1630	' Yes , indeed I was , Miss Barfoot ! '
70318	70329	70308	70310	the younger lady	1630	' I hesitated before speaking of such a frivolous entertainment . '
70347	70373	70343	70344	Miss Barfoot	212	' I have to make a concession occasionally on Miss Nunn 's account . It would be unkind never to allow her a little recreation . '
70413	70427	70428	70428	he	242	' Is there anything very good in the new Gilbert and Sullivan opera ? '
70431	70443	70395	70396	the visitor	439	' Many good things . You really have n't been yet ? '

70565	70607	70562	70562	he	242	' we have talked in the approved five o'clock way . Precisely the dialogue I heard in a drawing - room yesterday . It goes on day after day , year after year , through the whole of people 's lives . '
70608	70618	70654	70654	she	675	' You are on friendly terms with such people ? '
70619	70631	70632	70632	He	242	' I am on friendly terms with people of every kind . '
70639	70650	70632	70632	He	242	' I hope I may include you , Miss Nunn ? '
70690	70698	70700	70701	his cousin	1165	' Another cup of tea , Everard ? '
70703	70719	70663	70663	Monica	195	' Thank you . Who was the young lady you did n't introduce me to ? '
70720	70728	70676	70676	They	1635	' Miss Haven one of our pupils . '
70729	70738	70663	70663	Monica	195	' Does she think of going into business ? '
70739	70755	70676	70676	They	1635	' She has just got a place in the publishing department of a weekly paper . '
70756	70781	70663	70663	Monica	195	' But really from the few words of her talk that fell upon my ear I should have thought her a highly educated girl . '
70782	70787	70789	70790	Miss Barfoot	212	' So she is , '
70792	70798	70789	70790	Miss Barfoot	212	' What is your objection ? '
70799	70810	70663	70663	Monica	195	' Why does n't she aim at some better position ? '
70818	70878	70814	70814	Rhoda	197	' But nothing could be better for her . Some day she hopes to start a paper of her own , and to learn all the details of such business is just what she wants . Oh , you are still very conventional , Everard . You meant she ought to take up something graceful and pretty something ladylike . '
70879	70908	70663	70663	Monica	195	' No , no . It 's all right . I thoroughly approve . And when Miss Haven starts her paper , Miss Nunn will write for it . '
70909	70914	70814	70814	Rhoda	197	' I hope so , '
70919	70959	70663	70663	Monica	195	' You make me feel that I am in touch with the great movements of our time . It 's delightful to know you . But come now , is n't there any way in which I could help ? '
70963	70968	70960	70960	Mary	225	' None whatever , I 'm
70971	70971	70960	70960	Mary	225	'
70972	70986	70960	70960	Mary	225	' Well , " They also serve who only stand and wait . " '
71391	71410	71382	71382	he	242	' Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows , Imprison her soft hand , and let her rave '
71582	71587	71588	71588	he	242	' Do you play ? '
71591	71603	71588	71588	he	242	' Strange that I should still have to ask the question . '
71604	71613	71614	71614	she	197	' Oh , only a hymn on Sunday , '
71620	71624	71588	71588	he	242	' A hymn ? '
71625	71647	71588	71588	he	242	' Why not ? I like some of the old tunes very much . They remind me of the golden age . '
71648	71657	71588	71588	he	242	' In your own life , you mean ? '
71661	71682	71588	71588	he	242	' You have once or twice spoken of that time as if you were not quite happy in the present . '
71683	71711	71588	71588	he	242	' Of course I am not quite happy . What woman is ? I mean , what woman above the level of a petted pussy - cat ? '
71734	71760	71727	71727	He	242	' I wish it were in my power to remove some of your discontents . I would , more gladly than I can tell you . '
71761	71771	71772	71772	she	197	' You abound in good nature , Mr. Barfoot , '
71776	71786	71772	71772	she	197	' But unfortunately you ca n't change the world . '
71787	71807	71727	71727	He	242	' Not the world at large . But might I not change your views of it in some respects ? '
71808	71837	71772	71772	she	197	' Indeed I do n't see how you could . I think I had rather have my own view than any you might wish to substitute for it . '
71893	71900	71901	71901	he	1659	' My views are not ignoble , '
71904	71918	72001	72001	She	197	' I hope not . But they are the views of a man . '
71919	71933	72001	72001	She	197	' Man and woman ought to see life with much the same eyes . '
71934	71954	72001	72001	She	197	' Ought they ? Perhaps so . I am not sure . But they never will in our time . '
71955	71978	72001	72001	She	197	' Individuals may . The man and woman who have thrown away prejudice and superstition . You and I , for instance . '
71979	72000	72001	72001	She	197	' Oh , those words have such different meanings . In your judgment I should seem full of idle prejudice . '
72032	72043	72001	72001	She	197	' You have a prejudice against me , for instance . '
72044	72054	72056	72056	Rhoda	197	' Pray , did you go to the Savoy ? '
72059	72088	72001	72001	She	197	' I have no intention of talking about the Savoy , Miss Nunn . It is teacup time , but as yet we have the room to ourselves . '
72096	72104	72105	72105	He	1659	' The teacups shall come at once . '
72152	72207	72145	72145	he	1659	' Well , you were saying that you had a prejudice against me . Of course my cousin Mary is accountable for that . Mary has used me rather ill . Before ever you saw me , I represented to your mind something very disagreeable indeed . That was too bad of my cousin . '
72221	72229	72230	72230	he	1659	' I did n't know of this , '
72233	72250	72230	72230	he	1659	' when we met that day in the gardens , and when I made you so angry .
72251	72263	72145	72145	he	1659	' I was n't disposed to jest about what had happened . '
72264	72286	72230	72230	he	1659	' But neither was I. You quite misunderstood me . Will you tell me how that unpleasantness came to an end ? '
72287	72303	72145	72145	he	1659	' Oh yes . I admitted that I had been ill - mannered and obstinate . '
72304	72379	72230	72230	he	1659	' How delightful ! Obstinate ? I have a great deal of that in my character . All the active part of my life was one long fit of obstinacy . As a lad I determined on a certain career , and I stuck to it in spite of conscious unfitness , in spite of a great deal of suffering , out of sheer obstinacy . I wonder whether Mary ever told you that . '
72380	72389	72145	72145	he	1659	' She mentioned something of the kind once . '
72390	72501	72230	72230	he	1659	' You could hardly believe it , I dare say ? I am a far more reasonable being now . I have changed in so many respects that I hardly know my old self when I look back on it . Above all , in my thoughts about women . If I had married during my twenties I should have chosen , as the average man does , some simpleton with unpleasant results . If I marry now , it will be a woman of character and brains . Marry in the legal sense I never shall . My companion must be as independent of forms as I am myself . '
72519	72526	72502	72502	Rhoda	197	' You also are a reformer ? '
72527	72532	72533	72533	He	1661	' In that direction . '
72560	72565	72566	72566	she	197	' Questions of marriage , '
72572	72609	72566	72566	she	197	' do n't interest me much ; but this particular reform does n't seem very practical . It is trying to bring about an ideal state of things whilst we are yet struggling with elementary obstacles . '
72610	72630	72502	72502	Rhoda	197	' I do n't advocate this liberty for all mankind . Only for those who are worthy of it . '
72631	72634	72635	72635	she	197	' And what '
72639	72658	72635	72635	she	197	' are the sure signs of worthiness ? I think it would be very needful to know them . '
72665	72792	72794	72794	she	197	' True . But a free union presupposes equality of position . No honest man would propose it , for instance , to a woman incapable of understanding all it involved , or incapable of resuming her separate life if that became desirable . I admit all the difficulties . One must consider those of feeling , as well as the material . If my wife should declare that she must be released , I might suffer grievously , but being a man of some intelligence , I should admit that the suffering could n't be helped ; the brutality of enforced marriage does n't seem to me an alternative worth considering . It would n't seem so to any woman of the kind I mean . '
72828	72838	72839	72839	he	242	' After all , that is not your ideal ? '
72842	72854	72855	72855	Rhoda	197	' I have n't to do with the subject at all , '
72865	72879	72855	72855	Rhoda	197	' My work and thought are for the women who do not marry the '
72882	72899	72855	72855	Rhoda	197	' I call them . They alone interest me . One must n't undertake too much . '
72900	72909	72855	72855	Rhoda	197	' And you resolutely class yourself with them ? '
72910	72916	72855	72855	Rhoda	197	' Of course I do . '
72917	72962	72855	72855	Rhoda	197	' And therefore you have certain views of life which I should like to change . You are doing good work , but I had rather see any other woman in the world devote her life to it . I am selfish enough to wish '
72972	72978	72968	72969	the servant	791	' Mr. and Mrs. Widdowson . '
73410	73426	73405	73405	her	1678	' Oh , then do come and dine with us . Do , I beg ! '
73427	73434	73436	73437	Miss Nunn	197	' I will , with pleasure , '
73441	73451	73436	73437	Miss Nunn	197	' Can you wait and take me with you ? '
74745	74752	74753	74753	he	4145	' Shall we go home again ? '
74771	74781	74763	74763	his	4145	' I should like to see Milly , but I 'm
74794	74794	74783	74783	I	0	'
74795	74799	74753	74753	he	4145	' Why not ? '
74800	74834	74783	74783	I	0	' It 's a very poor little sitting - room , you know , and she might have some friend . Is n't there anywhere you could go , and meet me afterwards ? '
74843	74854	74753	74753	he	4145	' Nearly six o'clock . There is n't much time . '
74855	74917	74753	74753	he	4145	' Edmund , suppose you go home , and let me come back by myself ? You would n't mind , for once ? I should like so much to have a talk with Milly . If I got back about nine or half - past , I could have a little supper , and that 's all I should want . '
74922	74937	74918	74918	He	4145	' Oh , but I ca n't have you going about alone at night . '
74938	74942	74944	74944	Monica	195	' Why not ? '
74954	74965	74944	74944	Monica	195	' Are you afraid I shall be robbed or murdered ? '
74966	74976	74918	74918	He	4145	' Nonsense . But you must n't be alone . '
74977	74987	74944	74944	Monica	195	' Did n't I always use to be alone ? '
74994	75045	74988	74988	He	4145	' I have begged you not to speak of that . Why do you say what you know is disagreeable to me ? You used to do all sorts of things that you never ought to have been obliged to do , and it 's very painful to remember it . '
75071	75080	75081	75081	Widdowson	217	' I think we had better go home , '
75086	75112	74988	74988	He	4145	' If you wish it ; but I really do n't see why I should n't call on Milly , now that we are here . '
75113	75171	75081	75081	Widdowson	217	' Why did n't you speak of it before we left home ? You ought to be more methodical , Monica . Each morning I always plan how my day is to be spent , and it would be much better if you would do the same . Then you would n't be so restless and uncertain . '
75172	75180	75182	75182	Monica	195	' If I go to Rutland Street , '
75189	75200	75182	75182	Monica	195	' could n't you leave me there for an hour ? '
75201	75211	75081	75081	Widdowson	217	' What in the world am I to do ? '
75212	75245	75182	75182	Monica	195	' I should have thought you might walk about . It 's a pity you do n't know more people , Edmund . It would make things so much pleasanter for you . '
75487	75499	75500	75500	she	195	' You have n't been waiting here long , I hope ? '
75504	75514	75500	75500	she	195	' Ten minutes . But it does n't matter . '
75515	75517	75500	75500	she	195	' I 'm
75525	75525	75521	75521	We	1724	'
75526	75552	75500	75500	she	195	' Yes , but one must always be punctual . I wish I could impress that upon you . Life without punctuality is quite impossible . '

75582	75609	75500	75500	she	195	' We had better take a cab to Victoria . No knowing how long we may have to wait for a train when we get there . '
75610	75626	75500	75500	she	195	' Now do n't be so grumpy . Where have you been all the time ? '
75627	75640	75500	75500	she	195	' Oh , walking about . What else was I to do ? '
75740	75750	75751	75751	he	217	' Let us have something to eat at once , '
75758	75772	75751	75751	he	217	' This disorder really wo n't do : we must manage better somehow . '
76068	76077	76079	76079	Monica	195	' You are making a butterfly of me , '
76098	76103	76104	76104	he	217	' A beautiful woman , '
76124	76134	76104	76104	he	217	' a beautiful woman ought to be beautifully clad . '

76698	76810	76811	76811	Monica	195	' Woman 's sphere is the home , Monica . Unfortunately girls are often obliged to go out and earn their living , but this is unnatural , a necessity which advanced civilization will altogether abolish . You shall read John Ruskin ; every word he says about women is good and precious . If a woman can neither have a home of her own , nor find occupation in any one else 's she is deeply to be pitied ; her life is bound to be unhappy . I sincerely believe that an educated woman had better become a domestic servant than try to imitate the life of a man . '
76944	76966	76924	76924	she	195	' What a change you have made in my life , Edmund ! How much I have to thank you for ! '

77326	77326	77317	77317	You	195	'
77327	77336	77337	77337	she	195	' As much as usual , I think , '

77668	77682	77655	77655	he	217	' Not quite . But I do n't care to read just now . '
77693	77704	77705	77705	she	195	' Have you accepted Mrs. Luke 's invitation to dinner ? '
77708	77714	77655	77655	he	217	' I have declined it , '

77732	77744	77745	77745	His	217	' Surely we need n't discuss that over again , Monica . '

77766	77831	77763	77764	his wife	4133	' do you mean to break with her altogether ? If so , I think it 's very unwise , Edmund . What an opinion you must have of me , if you think I ca n't see people 's faults ! I know it 's very true , all you say about her . But she wishes to be kind to us , I 'm
77848	77848	77834	77834	I	0	'

77918	77926	77868	77868	he	217	' He 's often there , then ? '
77927	77947	77868	77868	he	217	' I do n't know . Perhaps he is . He 's Miss Barfoot 's cousin , you know . '
77948	77959	77868	77868	he	217	' You have n't seen him more than once before ? '
77960	77968	77868	77868	he	217	' No . Why do you ask ? '
77969	77987	77868	77868	he	217	' Oh , it was only that he seemed to speak as if you were old acquaintances . '
77988	77997	77868	77868	he	217	' That 's his way , I suppose . '
78047	78057	78058	78058	she	195	' You talked to him , did n't you ? '
78069	78092	78058	78058	she	195	' Oh , the kind of talk that is possible with a perfect stranger . I suppose he is in some profession ? '
78093	78109	78058	78058	she	195	' I really do n't know . Why , Edmund ? Does he interest you ? '
78110	78129	78130	78130	Widdowson	217	' Only that one likes to know something about the people that are introduced to one 's wife , '
78333	78338	78339	78339	he	217	' Are we friends ? '
78355	78361	78362	78362	Monica	195	' Of course we are , '
78372	78385	78339	78339	he	217	' Did n't he behave gruffly last night to his little girl ? '
78386	78391	78339	78339	he	217	' Just a little . '
78392	78407	78339	78339	he	217	' And what can the old bear do to show that he 's sorry ? '
78408	78414	78339	78339	he	217	' Never be gruff again . '
78415	78455	78339	78339	he	217	' The old bear is sometimes an old goose as well , and torments himself in the silliest way . Tell him so , if ever he begins to behave badly . Is n't it account - book morning ? '
78456	78467	78339	78339	he	217	' Yes . I 'll come to you at eleven . '
78468	78493	78339	78339	he	217	' And if we have a nice , quiet , comfortable week , I 'll take you to the Crystal Palace concert next Saturday . '
78603	78640	78784	78784	she	1807	' Now , why ca n't we always live like this ? What have we to do with other people ? Let us be everything to each other , and forget that any one else exists . '
78641	78652	78653	78653	Monica	195	' I ca n't help thinking that 's a mistake , '
78658	78683	78653	78653	Monica	195	' For one thing , if we saw more people , we should have so much more to talk about when we are alone . '
78684	78724	78784	78784	she	1807	' It 's better to talk about ourselves . I should n't care if I never again saw any living creature but you . You see , the old bear loves his little girl better than she loves him . '
78729	78748	78725	78725	Monica	195	' Is n't it true ? You do n't feel that my company would be enough for you ? '

79553	79580	79515	79515	she	195	' Oh , but there are places where it would n't be like this . You do n't mind the expense , do you , Edmund ? '
79581	79596	79597	79597	She	195	' Expense ? Not I , indeed ! But were you thinking of abroad ? '
79608	79626	79597	79597	She	195	' Oh ! would it be possible ? People do go out of England in the winter . '
79669	79678	79679	79679	he	217	' I have never been out of England , '
79685	79720	79648	79648	her	195	' All the more reason why we should go . I think Miss Barfoot could advise us about it . She has been abroad , I know , and she has so many friends . '
79721	79733	79734	79734	he	217	' I do n't see any need to consult Miss Barfoot , '
79738	79749	79734	79734	he	217	' I am not such a helpless man , Monica . '
79965	79971	79972	79972	he	268	' An immoral lot there , '

You could n't live by yourself . You have to eat at public tables , and you 'd have all sorts of people trying to make acquaintance with Mrs. Widdowson . They 're

80279	80323	80278	80278	I	0	'm bound to keep in with them . Be off , and let me pitch into your young man for daring to refuse my dinner . Do n't you know , sir , that my invitations are like those of Royalty polite commands ? '

81230	81241	81200	81200	she	4133	' Gravely ? Do n't I seem to enjoy myself ? '
81242	81277	81200	81200	she	4133	' Oh yes ; just now . But still in a rather serious way . One would think you always had cares on your mind , and were struggling to get rid of them . '
81278	81296	81200	81200	she	4133	' I have n't a care in the world . I am the most blessed of mortals . '
81297	81339	81200	81200	she	4133	' So you ought to think yourself . But when we get back again , how will it be ? You wo n't be angry with me ? I really do n't think I can live again as we were doing . '

81356	81364	81365	81365	she	1886	' We ought to have more enjoyment , '
81369	81425	81365	81365	she	1886	' Think of the numbers of people who live a dull , monotonous life just because they ca n't help it . How they would envy us , with so much money to spend , free to do just what we like ! Does n't it seem a pity to sit there day after day alone '
81426	81433	81434	81434	he	217	' Do n't , my darling ! '
81437	81451	81434	81434	he	217	' Do n't ! That makes me think you do n't really love me .
81452	81518	81365	81365	she	1886	' Nonsense ! I want you to see what I mean . I am not one of the silly people who care for nothing but amusement , but I do think we might enjoy our lives more when we are in London . We sha n't live for ever , you know . Is it right to spend day after day sitting there in the house '
81519	81552	81434	81434	he	217	' But come , come ; we have our occupations . Surely it ought to be a pleasure to you to see that the house is kept in order . There are duties '
81553	81571	81365	81365	she	1886	' Yes , I know . But these duties I could perform in an hour or two . '
81572	81576	81434	81434	he	217	' Not thoroughly . '
81577	81582	81365	81365	she	1886	' Quite thoroughly enough . '
81583	81607	81434	81434	he	217	' In my Opinion , Monica , a woman ought never to be so happy as when she is looking after her home . '
81663	81671	81672	81672	she	195	' I wish to do my duty , '
81679	81781	81672	81672	she	195	' but I do n't think it 's right to make dull work for oneself , when one might be living . I do n't think it is living to go on week after week like that . If we were poor , and I had a lot of children to look after as well as all the housework to do , I believe I should n't grumble at least , I hope I should n't . I should know that I ought to do what there was no one else to do , and make the best of it . But '
81782	81789	81790	81790	he	1888	' Make the best of it ! '
81794	81815	81672	81672	she	195	' What an expression to use ! It would not only be your duty , dear , but your privilege ! '
81816	81856	81857	81857	He	1888	' Wait a moment , Edmund . If you were a shopman earning fifteen shillings a week , and working from early morning to late at night , should you think it not Only your duty but your privilege ? '
81863	81898	81672	81672	she	195	' What comparison is there ? I should be earning a hard livelihood by slaving for other people . But a married woman who works in her own home , for her husband 's children '
81899	81975	81672	81672	she	195	' Work is work , and when a woman is overburdened with it she must find it difficult not to weary of home and husband and children all together . But of course I do n't mean to say that my work is too hard . All I mean is , that I do n't see why any one should make work , and why life should n't be as full of enjoyment as possible . '
81976	82010	81672	81672	she	195	' Monica , you have got these ideas from those people at Chelsea . That is exactly why I do n't care for you to see much of them . I utterly disapprove of '
82011	82036	81672	81672	she	195	' But you are mistaken . Miss Barfoot and Miss Nunn are all for work . They take life as seriously as you do . '
82037	82077	82078	82078	He	1889	' Work ? What kind of work ? They want to make women unwomanly , to make them unfit for the only duties women ought to perform . You know very well my opinions about that kind of thing . '
82092	82124	81672	81672	she	195	' I do n't think , Edmund , there 's much real difference between men and women . That is , there would n't be , if women had fair treatment . '
82125	82160	82172	82172	Pained	283	' Not much difference ? Oh , come ; you are talking nonsense . There 's as much difference between their minds as between their bodies . They are made for entirely different duties . '
82164	82171	82161	82161	Monica	195	' Oh , that word Duty ! '
82238	82270	82224	82224	He	217	' Dear , good little wife ! Do be guided by your husband . He is older than you , darling , and has seen so much more of the world . '
82271	82298	82224	82224	He	217	' I have n't said anything dreadful , dear . My thoughts do n't come from other people ; they rise naturally in my own head . '
82299	82325	82224	82224	He	217	' Now , what do you really want ? You say you ca n't live as we were doing . What change would you make ? '
82326	82402	82224	82224	He	217	' I should like to make more friends , and to see them often . I want to hear people talk , and know what is going on round about me . And to read a different kind of books ; books that would really amuse me , and give me something I could think about with pleasure . Life will be a burden to me before long if I do n't have more freedom . '
82403	82406	82224	82224	He	217	' Freedom ? '
82407	82422	82224	82224	He	217	' Yes , I do n't think there 's any harm in saying that . '
82423	82426	82427	82427	He	1891	' Freedom ? '
82432	82447	82427	82427	He	1891	' I shall begin to think that you wish you had never married me . '
82448	82538	82224	82224	He	217	' I should only wish that if I were made to feel that you shut me up in a house and could n't trust me to go where I chose . Suppose the thought took you that you would go and walk about the City some afternoon , and you wished to go alone , just to be more at ease , should I have a right to forbid you , or grumble at you ? And yet you are very dissatisfied if I wish to go anywhere alone . '
82539	82557	82427	82427	He	1891	' But here 's the old confusion . I am a man ; you are a woman . '
82558	82618	82224	82224	He	217	' I ca n't see that that makes any difference . A woman ought to go about just as freely as a man . I do n't think it 's just . When I have done my work at home I think I ought to be every bit as free as you are every bit as free . And I 'm
82636	82636	82637	82637	He	217	'
82643	82678	82637	82637	He	217	' That 's a dreadful thing for you to say . So , if I disapprove of your becoming the kind of woman that acknowledges no law , you will cease to love me ? '
82679	82686	82224	82224	He	217	' What law do you mean ? '
82687	82702	82703	82703	he	217	' Why , the natural law that points out a woman 's place , and '
82709	82719	82224	82224	He	217	' commands her to follow her husband 's guidance . '
82720	82737	82224	82224	He	217	' Now you are angry . We must n't talk about it any more just now . '
82985	82999	83000	83000	he	217	' I do n't think you 'll get much good out of that , '
83011	83019	83020	83020	she	195	' No harm , at all events , '
83026	83028	83020	83020	she	195	' I 'm

83053	83063	83064	83064	He	217	' I 'll see how I like this first . '
83193	83202	83204	83205	the lady	4316	' I have been expecting to see you , '
83207	83214	83204	83205	the lady	4316	' We arrived three days ago . '
83378	83387	83388	83388	she	277	' Come and see me , will you ? '
83395	83423	83388	83388	she	277	' One ca n't get much in the evenings ; I shall be nearly always at home after dinner , and we have music of a kind . '
83524	83530	83520	83520	Widdowson	217	' Who is that person ? '
83531	83547	83577	83577	Monica	195	' I only know her name , and that she goes to Miss Barfoot 's . '
83548	83556	83557	83557	he	217	' It 's a most extraordinary thing , '
83563	83576	83557	83557	he	217	' There 's no getting out of the way of those people . '
83593	83607	83577	83577	Monica	195	' It 's still more extraordinary that you should object so to them . '
83608	83629	83577	83577	Monica	195	' Whether or no I do object , and I had rather you did n't go to see that woman . '
83630	83635	83636	83636	Monica	195	' You are unreasonable , '
83640	83649	83636	83636	Monica	195	' Certainly I shall go and see her . '
83650	83671	83577	83577	Monica	195	' I forbid you to do so ! If you go , it will be in defiance of my wish . '
83672	83687	83688	83688	His	1923	' Then I am obliged to defy your wish . I shall certainly go . '
83923	83926	83927	83927	He	217	' Monica ! '
83938	83947	83929	83929	his	217	' Monica ! do n't you love me ? '
83955	83958	83948	83948	She	195	' Monica ! '
83982	84006	83963	83963	he	217	' Have you no love for me ? My darling ! My dear , beautiful wife ! Have you begun to hate me ? '
84022	84037	84013	84013	She	195	' I was so violent , so brutal with you . I spoke without thinking '
84038	84092	84013	84013	She	195	' But why should you speak like that ? Why are you so unreasonable ? If you forbid me to do simple things , with not the least harm in them , you ca n't expect me to take it like a child . I shall resist ; I ca n't help it . '
84117	84155	84112	84112	he	217	' I want to keep you all to myself . I do n't like these people they think so differently they put such hateful ideas into your mind they are not the right kind of friends for you '
84156	84179	84180	84180	He	217	' You misunderstand them , and you do n't in the least understand me . Oh , you hurt me , Edmund ! '
84193	84237	84180	84180	He	217	' I had rather you were dead than that you should cease to love me ! You shall go to see her ; I wo n't say a word against it . But , Monica , be faithful , be faithful to me ! '
84238	84243	84244	84244	she	195	' Faithful to you ? '
84249	84276	84244	84244	she	195	' What have I said or done to put you in such a state ? Because I wish to make a few friends as all women do '
84277	84364	84180	84180	He	217	' It 's because I have lived so much alone . I have never had more than one or two friends , and I am absurdly jealous when you want to get away from me and amuse yourself with strangers . I ca n't talk to such people . I am not suited for society . If I had n't met you in that strange way , by miracle , I should never have been able to marry . If I allow you to have these friends '
84365	84392	84244	84244	she	195	' I do n't like to hear that word . Why should you say allow ? Do you think of me as your servant , Edmund ? '
84393	84413	84180	84180	He	217	' You know how I think of you . It is I who am your servant , your slave . '
84414	84423	84424	84424	She	1940	' Oh , I ca n't believe that ! '
84436	84455	84424	84424	She	1940	' Such words do n't mean anything . It is you who forbid and allow and command , and '
84456	84477	84180	84180	He	217	' I will never again use such words . Only convince me that you love me as much as ever . '
84478	84486	84424	84424	She	1940	' It is so miserable to begin quarrelling '
84487	84506	84180	84180	He	217	' Never again ! Say you love me ! Put your arms round my neck press closer to me '
84519	84529	84180	84180	He	217	' You ca n't say that you love me ? '
84530	84559	84180	84180	He	217	' I think I am always showing it . Do get ready for dinner now ; it 's past seven . Oh , how foolish you have been ! '
84777	84785	84786	84786	she	195	' You must either trust me completely , '
84789	84812	84786	84786	she	195	' or not at all . If you ca n't and wo n't trust me , how can I possibly love you ? '
84813	84820	84822	84823	her husband	4145	' Am I never to advise ? '
84846	84860	84861	84861	she	195	' Oh , that 's a very different thing from forbidding and commanding ! '
84864	84920	84861	84861	she	195	' There was that novel this morning . Of course I know as well as you do that " Guy Mannering " is better ; but that does n't say I am not to form my opinion of other books . You must n't be afraid to leave me the same freedom you have yourself . '
85045	85058	85059	85059	she	195	' Will you go with me to Mrs. Cosgrove 's this evening ? '
85396	85436	85376	85377	Mrs. Bevis	287	' Do you know my son , Mrs. Widdowson ? Oh , I thought you had perhaps met him . You will do so this evening , I hope . He is over here on a fortnight 's holiday . '
85437	85444	85445	85445	Monica	195	' Do you live in Guernsey ? '
85448	85486	85376	85377	Mrs. Bevis	287	' I practically live here , and one of my daughters is always with me . The other two live with their brother in a flat in Bayswater . Do you care for flats , Mrs. Widdowson ? '
85500	85509	85511	85512	Mrs. Bevis	287	' I do think them such a boon , '
85514	85869	85511	85512	Mrs. Bevis	287	' They are expensive but the advantages and comforts are so many . My son would n't on any consideration give up his flat . As I was saying , he always has two of his sisters to keep house for him . He is quite a young man , not yet thirty , but would you believe it ? we are all dependent upon him ! My son has supported the whole of the family for the last six or seven years , and that by his own work . It sounds incredible , does n't it ? But for him we should be quite unable to live . The dear girls have very delicate health ; simply impossible for them to exert themselves in any way . My son has made extraordinary sacrifices on our account . His desire was to be a professional musician , and every one thinks he would have become eminent ; myself , I am convinced of it perhaps that is only natural . But when our circumstances began to grow very doubtful , and we really did n't know what was before us , my son consented to follow a business career that of wine merchant , with which his father was connected . And he exerted himself so nobly , and gave proof of such ability , that very soon all our fears were at an end ; and now , before he is thirty , his position is quite assured . We have no longer a care . I live here very economically really sweet lodgings on the road to St. Martin 's ; I do hope you will come and see me . And the girls go backwards and forwards . You see we are all here at present . When my son returns to London he will take the eldest and the youngest with him . The middle girl , dear Grace she is thought very clever in water - colours , and I am quite sure , if it were necessary , she could pursue the arts in a professional spirit . '
85943	85948	85950	85952	Miss Grace Bevis	288	' His own composition , '
86053	86060	86061	86061	she	195	' Thank you so very much , '
86064	86074	86061	86061	she	195	' for that charming song . Is it published ? '
86075	86081	86082	86082	He	1982	' Oh dear , no ! '
86091	86120	86082	86082	He	1982	' It 's one of two or three that I somehow struck out when I was studying in Germany , ages ago . You play , I hope ? '
86127	86175	86121	86121	Monica	195	' Oh , what does it matter ? There are hosts of people who will always be overjoyed to play when you ask them . It would be a capital thing if only those children were allowed to learn an instrument who showed genuine talent for music . '
86176	86181	86183	86183	Monica	195	' In that case , '
86185	86200	86183	86183	Monica	195	' there certainly would n't be hosts of people ready to play for me . '

86274	86372	86205	86205	His	1982	' As for myself , how I ever undertake the thing I really do n't know . One of these times I shall die ; there 's not a shadow of doubt of that . The girls always have to carry me ashore , one holding me by the hair and one by the boots . Happily , I am so emancipated that my weight does n't distress them . I pick up flesh in a day or two , and then my health is stupendous as at present . You see how marvellously fit I look . '
86373	86381	86383	86383	Monica	195	' Yes , you look very well , '
86393	86456	86457	86457	he	1991	' It 's deceptive . All our family have wretched constitutions . If I go to work regularly for a couple of months without a holiday , I sink into absolute decrepitude . An office - chair has been specially made for me , to hold me up at the desk . I beg your pardon for this clowning , Mrs. Widdowson , '
86464	86514	86457	86457	he	1991	' The air puts me in such spirits . What air it is ! Speaking quite seriously , my mother was saved by coming to live here . We believed her to be dying , and now I have hopes that she will live ever so many years longer . '

86672	86716	86607	86607	Monica	195	' Unsatisfactory man ! You ca n't bring yourself to admit that it was pleasant to be among new people . I believe , in your heart , you think all enjoyment is wrong . The music was nice , was n't it ? '
86717	86737	86609	86609	her	195	' I did n't think much of the girl 's singing , but that fellow Bevis was n't bad . '
86752	86780	86738	86738	Monica	195	' No , he was n't at all bad . I saw you talking with Mrs. Bevis . Did she tell you anything about her wonderful son ? '
86781	86785	86738	86738	Monica	195	' Nothing particular . '
86786	86798	86738	86738	Monica	195	' Oh , then I must tell you the whole story . '
86816	86831	86833	86833	Widdowson	217	' I do n't see that he has done anything more than his duty , '

86964	86989	86959	86959	he	667	' Only think of it . The girls are all rather below par just now ; they had better stay here for the present . '

87001	87055	86959	86959	he	667	' Yes . It 's very sad . I must bear up under it . The worst of it is , I am naturally subject to depression . In solitude I sink , sink . But the subject is too painful . Do n't let us darken the last hours with such reflections . '

87264	87286	87238	87238	Monica	195	' Something to do ? Why , they attend to their mother and their brother . What could be more proper ? '
87287	87303	87238	87238	Monica	195	' Very proper , perhaps . But they are miserable , and always will be . '
87304	87328	87238	87238	Monica	195	' Then they have no right to be miserable . They are doing their duty , and that ought to keep them cheerful . '

87905	87936	87895	87895	Everard	242	' No , my boy , you do not smoke here . And , in fact , I like your claret ; I wo n't spoil the flavour of it . '

It would be brutal if I declined to go to church on a Sunday morning . You see , my strictly scientific attitude helps in avoiding offence . Fanny ca n't understand it , but my lack of dogmatism vastly relieves her . I have been trying to explain to her that the scientific mind can have nothing to do with materialism . The new order of ideas is of course very difficult for her to grasp ; but in time , in time . '

I seriously believe that she has a plan for killing her husband . You remember my mentioning in a letter his horse - accident ? He has never recovered from that , and as likely as not never will . His wife brought him away from Madeira just when he ought to have stopped there to get well . He settled himself at Torquay , whilst that woman ran about to pay visits . It was understood that she should go back to him at Torquay , but this she at length refused to do . The place was too dull ; it did n't suit her extremely delicate health ; she must live in London , her pure native air . If Tom had taken any advice , he would have let her live just where she pleased , thanking Heaven that she was at a distance from him . But the poor fellow ca n't be away from her . He has come up , and here I feel convinced he will die . It 's a very monstrous thing , but uncommonly like women in general who have got a man into their power . '

90690	90706	90640	90640	Everard	242	' No . A vigorous and rational optimist such as I myself aim at being . '
90707	90727	90596	90596	she	197	' Do you ? But optimism of that kind must be proved by some effort on behalf of society . '
90728	90760	90640	90640	Everard	242	' Precisely the effort I am making . If a man works at developing and fortifying the best things in his own character , he is surely doing society a service . '

I wo n't make myself ridiculous in your eyes if I can help it . You despise the love - making of ballrooms and garden parties ; so do I , most heartily . Let me speak like a man who has few illusions to overcome . I want you for the companion of my life ; I do n't see very well how I am to do without you . You know , I think , that I have only a moderate competence ; it 's enough to live upon without miseries , that 's all one can say . Probably I shall never be richer , for I ca n't promise to exert myself to earn money ; I wish to live for other things . You can picture the kind of life I want you to share . You know me well enough to understand that my wife if we use the old word would be as free to live in her own way as I to live in mine . All the same , it is love that I am asking for . Think how you may about man and woman , you know that there is such a thing as love between them , and that the love of a man and a woman who can think intelligently may be the best thing life has to offer them .

I have come to think your face so beautiful that I am in torment with the desire to press my lips upon yours . Do n't be afraid that I shall be brutal enough to do it without your consent ; my respect for you is stronger even than my passion . When I first saw you , I thought you interesting because of your evident intelligence nothing more ; indeed you were not a woman to me . Now you are the one woman in the world ; no other can draw my eyes from you . Touch me with your fingers and I shall tremble that is what my love means . '

92286	92463	92262	92262	He	242	' Yes , it is true . Love revives the barbarian ; it would n't mean much if it did n't . In this one respect I suppose no man , however civilized , would wish the woman he loves to be his equal . Marriage by capture ca n't quite be done away with . You say you have not the least love for me ; if you had , should I like you to confess it instantly ? A man must plead and woo ; but there are different ways . I ca n't kneel before you and exclaim about my miserable unworthiness for I am not unworthy of you . I shall never call you queen and goddess unless in delirium , and I think I should soon weary of the woman who put her head under my foot . Just because I am stronger than you , and have stronger passions , I take that advantage try to overcome , as I may , the womanly resistance which is one of your charms .

92553	92565	92262	92262	He	242	' But suppose marriage in no way interfered with your work ? '
92566	92599	92262	92262	He	242	' It would interfere hopelessly with the best part of my life . I thought you understood this . What would become of the encouragement I am able to offer our girls ? '
92600	92606	92262	92262	He	242	' Encouragement to refuse marriage ? '
92607	92713	92262	92262	He	242	' To scorn the old idea that a woman 's life is wasted if she does not marry . My work is to help those women who , by sheer necessity , must live alone woman whom vulgar opinion ridicules . How can I help them so effectually as by living among them , one of them , and showing that my life is anything but weariness and lamentation ? I am fitted for this . It gives me a sense of power and usefulness which I enjoy . Your cousin is doing the same work admirably . If I deserted I should despise myself . '
92714	92737	92262	92262	He	242	' Magnificent ! If I could bear the thought of living without you , I should bid you persevere and be great . '
92738	92747	92262	92262	He	242	' I need no such bidding to persevere . '
92748	92770	92262	92262	He	242	' And for that very reason , because you are capable of such things , I love you only the more . '
92785	92793	92794	92794	she	2081	' Then , for your own peace , '
92797	92822	92794	92794	she	2081	' I must hope that you will avoid me . It is so easily done . We have nothing in common , Mr. Barfoot . '
92823	92886	92262	92262	He	242	' I ca n't agree with that . For one thing , there are perhaps not half a dozen women living with whom I could talk as I have talked with you . It is n't likely that I shall ever meet one . Am I to make my bow , and abandon in resignation the one chance of perfecting my life ? '
92887	92903	92794	92794	she	2081	' You do n't know me . We differ profoundly on a thousand essential points . '
92904	92918	92262	92262	He	242	' You think so because you have a very wrong idea of me . '
92928	92932	92933	92933	she	197	' Mr. Barfoot , '
92940	92956	92933	92933	she	197	' you will forgive me if I remind you that it is past ten o'clock . '
92962	92985	92794	92794	she	2081	' The fog certainly can not be so thick now . Shall I ask them to try and get you a cab ? '
92986	92994	92262	92262	He	242	' I shall walk to the station . '
92995	93001	93002	93002	She	197	' Only one more word . '
93013	93044	93002	93002	She	197	' We have spoken in this way for the last time . You will not oblige me to take all sorts of trouble merely to avoid useless and painful conversations ? '
93045	93057	92262	92262	He	242	' I love you , and I ca n't abandon hope . '
93058	93066	93002	93002	She	197	' Then I must take that trouble . '
93080	93089	93091	93091	Everard	242	' I must n't offer to shake hands , '
93098	93115	93067	93067	Her	197	' I hope you can remember that I had no choice but to be your hostess . '
93320	93324	93326	93326	her	212	' What happened ? '
93342	93351	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' Did the fog keep our guest away ? '
93352	93359	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' No ; he dined here . '
93360	93373	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' It was just as well . You have n't been lonely . '
93397	93405	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' Did he offer to go away ? '
93406	93427	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' It was really impossible . It took him more than half an hour to get here from Sloane Square . '
93428	93443	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' Foolish fellow ! Why did n't he take a train back at once ? '
93464	93470	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' Did you quarrel much ? '
93471	93480	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' Not more than was to be expected . '
93481	93492	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' He did n't think of staying for my return ? '
93493	93500	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' He left about ten o'clock . '
93501	93536	93331	93331	Rhoda	197	' Of course . Quite late enough , under the circumstances . It was very unfortunate , but I do n't suppose Everard cared much . He would enjoy the opportunity of teasing you . '
93623	93630	93609	93609	her	924	' What is it , dear ? '
93631	93649	93650	93651	Miss Barfoot	212	' I am going to tax your good - nature , to ask you about unpleasant things . '
93670	93690	93658	93658	She	212	' Will you tell me in plain terms what it was that your cousin did when he disgraced himself ? '
93691	93697	93650	93651	Miss Barfoot	212	' Must you really know ? '
93698	93704	93658	93658	She	212	' I wish to know . '
93722	93743	93713	93713	her	212	' Then I shall take the liberty of an old friend , Rhoda . Why do you wish to know ? '
93744	93748	93750	93752	the other dryly	2092	' Mr. Barfoot , '
93754	93769	93750	93752	the other dryly	2092	' has been good enough to say that he is in love with me . '
93774	93793	93770	93770	Their	2093	' I suspected it . I felt sure it was coming . He asked you to marry him ? '
93794	93801	93803	93803	Rhoda	197	' No , he did n't , '
93809	93817	93770	93770	Their	2093	' You would n't allow him to ? '
93818	93844	93770	93770	Their	2093	' At all events , it did n't come to that . I should be glad if you would let me know what I asked . '
93888	93891	93893	93894	her friend	631	' That , '
93899	94007	93893	93894	her friend	631	' is the story as it was understood at the time disgraceful to him in every particular . He knew what was said of him , and offered not a word of contradiction . But not very long ago he asked me one evening if you had been informed of this scandal . I told him that you knew he had done something which I thought very base . Everard was hurt , and thereupon he declared that neither I nor any other of his acquaintances knew the truth that he had been maligned . He refused to say more , and what am I to believe ? '
94015	94025	94113	94113	Rhoda	197	' He declared that he was n't to blame ? '
94026	94039	93893	93894	her friend	631	' I suppose he meant that . But it is difficult to see '
94040	94050	94052	94052	Rhoda	197	' Of course the truth can never be known , '
94058	94072	94052	94052	Rhoda	197	' And it does n't matter . Thank you for satisfying my curiosity . '
94082	94093	93893	93894	her friend	631	' Some day , Rhoda , you shall satisfy mine . '
94094	94102	94073	94074	Miss Barfoot	212	' Yes if we live long enough . '
94534	94539	94541	94541	Everard	242	' Tom is dying , '
94555	94582	94586	94586	he	4145	' Dr. Swain assures me that unless he be removed he can not last more than a month or two . This morning I saw the woman '
94596	94683	94586	94586	he	4145	' and talked to her in what was probably the plainest language she ever had the privilege of hearing . It was a tremendous scene , brought to a close only by her flinging herself on the sofa with shrieks which terrified the whole household . My idea is that we must carry the poor fellow away by force . His infatuation makes me rage and curse , but I am bent on trying to save his life . Will you come and give your help ? '
95019	95033	94995	94995	Everard	242	' travel . Having read the letter , he laughed with a peculiar fierceness .
95034	95040	95042	95043	Miss Barfoot	212	' This kind of thing , '
95045	95067	95042	95043	Miss Barfoot	212	' may necessitate your prosecuting her . There is a limit , you know , even to a woman 's licence . '
95068	95075	95076	95076	he	4145	' I am far more likely , '
95079	95095	95076	95076	he	4145	' to purchase a very nice little cane , and give her an exemplary thrashing . '
95096	95101	94995	94995	Everard	242	' Oh ! Oh ! '
95102	95247	95076	95076	he	4145	' Upon my word , I see no reason against it ! That 's how I should deal with a man who talked about me in this way , and none the less if he were a puny creature quite unable to protect himself . In that furious scene before we got Tom away I felt most terribly tempted to beat her . There 's a great deal to be said for woman - beating . I am quite sure that many a labouring man who pommels his wife is doing exactly the right thing ; no other measure would have the least result . You see what comes of impunity . If this woman saw the possibility that I should give her a public caning she would be far more careful how she behaved herself . Let us ask Miss Nunn 's opinion . '
95269	95275	95277	95277	Barfoot	263	' Glance over this letter , '
95279	95335	95277	95277	Barfoot	263	' Oh , you have seen it . I propose to get a light , supple , dandyish cane , and to give Mrs. Thomas Barfoot half a dozen smart cuts across the back in her own drawing - room , some afternoon when people were present . What have you to say to it ? '
95350	95356	95357	95357	she	197	' I sympathized with you , '
95362	95375	95357	95357	she	197	' but I do n't think I would go to that extremity . '
95387	95393	95394	95394	Rhoda	197	' You are quite right , '
95397	95423	95394	95394	Rhoda	197	' I think many women deserve to be beaten , and ought to be beaten . But public Opinion would be so much against you . '
95424	95437	95394	95394	Rhoda	197	' What do I care ? So is public opinion against you . '
95438	95465	95394	95394	Rhoda	197	' Very well . Do as you like . Miss Barfoot and I will come to the police court and give strong evidence in your favour . '
95466	95473	95475	95475	Everard	242	' Now there 's a woman ! '
95496	95520	95483	95483	Rhoda	197	' Look at her , Mary . Do you wonder that I would walk the diameter of the globe to win her love ? '
95542	95549	95552	95552	Everard	242	' That 's the simple truth , '
95555	95618	95552	95552	Everard	242	' and she knows it , and yet wo n't listen to me . Well , good - bye to you both ! Now that I have so grossly misbehaved myself , she has a good excuse for refusing even to enter the room when I am here . But do speak a word for me whilst I am away , Mary . '
95658	95668	95649	95650	Miss Barfoot	212	' Really my poor cousin is not very discreet . '
95669	95673	95674	95674	Rhoda	197	' Anything but , '
95690	95705	95685	95685	her	197	' Do you think he will really cane his sister - in - law ? '
95706	95715	95674	95674	Rhoda	197	' How can you ask such a question ? '
95716	95731	95685	95685	her	197	' It would be amusing . I should think better of him for it . '
95732	95759	95674	95674	Rhoda	197	' Well , make it a condition . We know the story of the lady and her glove . I can see you sympathize with her . '
95794	95803	95773	95773	she	212	' Face this monstrous scandal and I am yours .
95877	96038	95866	95866	she	212	' DEAR MISS NUNN , I am sitting at a little marble table outside a cafe on the Cannibiere . Does that name convey anything to you ? The Cannibiere is the principal street of Marseilles , street of gorgeous cafe 's and restaurants , just now blazing with electric light . You , no doubt , are shivering by the fireside ; here it is like an evening of summer . I have dined luxuriously , and I am taking my coffee whilst I write . At a table near to me sit two girls , engaged in the liveliest possible conversation , of which I catch a few words now and then , pretty French phrases that caress the ear . One of them is so strikingly beautiful that I can not take my eyes from her when they have been tempted to that quarter . She speaks with indescribable grace and animation , has the sweetest eyes and lips
96039	96123	95866	95866	she	212	' And all the time I am thinking of some one else . Ah , if you were here ! How we would enjoy ourselves among these southern scenes ! Alone , it is delightful ; but with you for a companion , with you to talk about everything in your splendidly frank way ! This French girl 's talk is of course only silly chatter ; it makes me long to hear a few words from your lips strong , brave , intelligent .
96124	96221	95866	95866	she	212	' I dream of the ideal possibility . Suppose I were to look up and see you standing just in front of me , there on the pavement . You have come in a few hours straight from London . Your eyes glow with delight . To - morrow we shall travel on to Genoa , you and I , more than friends , and infinitely more than the common husband and wife ! We have bidden the world go round for our amusement ; henceforth it is our occupation to observe and discuss and make merry .
96222	96268	95866	95866	she	212	' Is it all in vain ? Rhoda , if you never love me , my life will be poor to what it might have been ; and you , you also , will lose something . In imagination I kiss your hands and your lips .
96272	96272	96269	96270	EVERARD BARFOOT	242	'
96425	96434	96409	96409	she	197	' These in return for your Cheddar pinks , '
96443	96529	96409	96409	she	197	' I had them an hour ago from a pretty girl in the streets of Parma . I did n't care to buy , and walked on , but the pretty girl ran by me , and with gentle force fixed the flowers in my button - hole , so that I had no choice but to stroke her velvety cheek and give her a lira . How hungry I am for the sight of your face ! Think of me sometimes , dear friend . '
96545	96560	96562	96563	Miss Barfoot	212	' I must depend on you , it seems , for news of Everard , '
96567	96574	96575	96575	Rhoda	197	' I can only tell you , '
96579	96602	96575	96575	Rhoda	197	' that he has travelled from the south of France to the north of Italy , with much observation of female countenances . '
96603	96610	96575	96575	Rhoda	197	' He informs you of that ? '
96611	96629	96575	96575	Rhoda	197	' Very naturally . It is his chief interest . One likes people to tell the truth . '
96708	96787	96788	96788	She	2146	' talk with her he took a place by Mrs. Widdowson , who , it struck him , looked by no means in such good spirits as during the early days of her marriage . As soon as she began to converse , his impression of a change in her was confirmed ; the girlishness so pleasantly noticeable when first he knew her had disappeared , and the gravity substituted for it was suggestive of disillusion , of trouble .
96808	96834	96788	96788	She	2146	' Bevis ? I have seen the name on the index at the foot of the stairs ; but I do n't know them personally . '
96835	96848	96850	96850	Monica	195	' That was how I came to know that you live there , '
96852	96888	96850	96850	Monica	195	' My husband took me to call upon the Bevises , and there we saw your name . At least , we supposed it was you , and Miss Barfoot tells me we were right . '
96889	96926	96788	96788	She	2146	' Oh yes ; I live there all alone , a gloomy bachelor . How delightful if you knocked at my door some day , when you and Mr. Widdowson are again calling on your friends . '
96936	96945	96946	96946	she	195	' You have been away out of England ? '
96950	96956	96788	96788	She	2146	' Yes ; in Italy . '
96957	96962	96788	96788	She	2146	' I envy you . '
96963	96970	96788	96788	She	2146	' You have never been there ? '
96971	96976	96788	96788	She	2146	' No not yet . '
97031	97038	97013	97014	Miss Haven	227	' Miss Nunn not at home ? '
97039	97050	97013	97014	Miss Haven	227	' No . Wo n't be till dinner - time . '
97051	97055	97013	97014	Miss Haven	227	' Quite well ? '
97056	97077	97013	97014	Miss Haven	227	' Never was better . Would you care to come back and dine with us at half - past seven ? '
97078	97084	97013	97014	Miss Haven	227	' Of course I should . '
97168	97176	97177	97177	he	2149	' Are we travelling the same way ? '
97180	97183	97177	97177	he	2149	' Westward ? '
97184	97198	97213	97213	he	2149	' Yes . I am going all the way round to Portland Road . '
97442	97448	97449	97449	she	265	' Probably because I married , '
97455	97467	97449	97449	she	265	' Is Miss Nunn really such a determined enemy of marriage ? '
97468	97491	97449	97449	she	265	' She thinks it pardonable in very weak people . In my case she was indulgent enough to come to the wedding . '
97499	97512	97449	97449	she	265	' She came to your wedding ? And wore a wedding garment ? '
97513	97522	97449	97449	she	265	' Oh yes . And looked very nice . '
97523	97534	97449	97449	she	265	' Do describe it to me . Can you remember ? '
97586	97598	97643	97643	his	2174	' You could n't imagine Miss Nunn in such a costume ? '
97599	97610	97643	97643	his	2174	' I should very much like to have seen her . '
97611	97624	97643	97643	his	2174	' She has a very striking face do n't you think so ? '
97625	97634	97643	97643	his	2174	' Indeed I do . A wonderful face . '
97648	97658	97659	97659	he	2174	' To me the most interesting of all faces , '
97671	97682	97663	97663	His	2174	' Does it seem strange to you , Mrs. Widdowson ? '
97683	97691	97663	97663	His	2174	' Oh why ? Not at all . '
97914	97926	97928	97928	Barfoot	212	' I dined with our friends at Chelsea on Saturday evening , '
97930	97945	97928	97928	Barfoot	212	' On Saturday ? You did n't tell me you were going back again . '
97946	97958	97928	97928	Barfoot	212	' I was n't thinking of it just at the time . '
97965	97969	97970	97970	he	2174	' You see , '
97974	98030	97970	97970	he	2174	' I expected nothing , and happy for me that it was so . Miss Nunn was in her severest mood ; I think she did n't smile once through the evening . I will confess to you I wrote her a letter whilst I was abroad , and it offended her , I suppose . '
98031	98047	97928	97928	Barfoot	212	' I do n't think you can always judge of her thoughts by her face . '
98048	98152	97970	97970	he	2174	' Perhaps not . But I have studied her face so often and so closely . For all that , she is more a mystery to me than any woman I have ever known . That , of course , is partly the reason of her power over me . I feel that if ever if ever she should disclose herself to me , it would be the strangest revelation . Every woman wears a mask , except to one man ; but Rhoda 's Miss Nunn 's is , I fancy , a far completer disguise than I ever tried to pierce . '
98281	98286	98287	98287	she	195	' Do you mean , '
98290	98300	98287	98287	she	195	' that Miss Nunn seems to disguise her feelings ? '
98301	98324	98363	98363	her	265	' It is supposed to be wrong is n't it ? for a man to ask one woman her opinion of another . '
98325	98335	98336	98336	Monica	195	' I ca n't be treacherous if I wished , '
98339	98349	98336	98336	Monica	195	' I do n't feel that I understand her . '
98412	98423	98400	98400	he	742	' Do you believe her capable of falling in love ? '
98440	98453	98430	98430	She	195	' She would perhaps try not not to acknowledge it to herself . '
98454	98464	98400	98400	he	742	' When , in fact , it had happened ? '
98465	98477	98430	98430	She	195	' She thinks it so much nobler to disregard such feelings . '
98478	98499	98500	98500	He	742	' I know . She is to be an inspiring example to the women who can not hope to marry . '
98504	98524	98500	98500	He	742	' And I suppose it is quite possible that mere shame would withhold her from taking the opposite course . '
98525	98534	98430	98430	She	195	' I think she is very strong . But '
98535	98538	98500	98500	He	742	' But ? '
98546	98577	98539	98539	He	742	' I ca n't tell . I do n't really know her . A woman may be as much a mystery to another woman as she is to a man . '
98578	98607	98430	98430	She	195	' On the whole , I am glad to hear you say that . I believe it . It is only the vulgar that hold a different opinion . '
98608	98619	98539	98539	He	742	' Shall we look at the pictures , Mr. Barfoot ? '
98620	98634	98430	98430	She	195	' Oh , I am so sorry . I have been wasting your time '
98678	98693	98675	98675	his	249	' I think that is Mr. Widdowson on the other side of the room . '
99532	99540	99541	99541	Monica	195	' So you have come after all ? '
99678	99688	99675	99675	Widdowson	217	' How long do you want to stay here ? '
99689	99697	99698	99698	she	195	' I will go whenever you like , '
99706	99716	99675	99675	Widdowson	217	' I have no wish to spoil your pleasure . '
99717	99737	99675	99675	Widdowson	217	' Really , I have very little pleasure in anything . Did you come to keep me in sight ? '
99738	99754	99675	99675	Widdowson	217	' I think we will go home now , and you can come another day . '
99833	99842	99843	99843	he	4145	' I have almost made up my mind , '
99850	99883	99843	99843	he	4145	' to take a serious step . As you have always spoken with pleasure of your old home , Clevedon , suppose we give up this house and go and live there ? '
99884	99892	99821	99821	Monica	195	' It is for you to decide . '
99893	99905	99843	99843	he	4145	' I want to know whether you would have any objection . '
99906	99914	99821	99821	Monica	195	' I shall do as you wish . '
99915	99973	99843	99843	he	4145	' No , that is n't enough . The plan I have in mind is this . I should take a good large house no doubt rents are low in the neighbourhood and ask your sisters to come and live with us . I think it would be a good thing both for them and for you . '
99974	99998	99821	99821	Monica	195	' You ca n't be sure that they would agree to it . You see that Virginia prefers her lodgings to living here . '
100073	100086	100087	100087	he	1667	' I think they both would be glad to live at Clevedon , '
100090	100095	100087	100087	he	1667	' judging from your sisters '
100142	100142	100134	100134	you	195	'
100147	100152	100143	100143	Monica	195	' Please answer me . '
100153	100161	100143	100143	Monica	195	' Why have you thought of it ? '
100162	100194	100143	100143	Monica	195	' I do n't think I need explain . We have had too many unpleasant conversations , and I wish to act for the best without saying things you would misunderstand . '
100195	100242	100143	100143	Monica	195	' There is no fear of my misunderstanding . You have no confidence in me , and you want to get me away into a quiet country place where I shall be under your eyes every moment . It 's much better to say that plainly . '
100243	100254	100143	100143	Monica	195	' That means you would consider it going to prison . '
100255	100267	100143	100143	Monica	195	' How could I help ? What other motive have you ? '
100300	100320	100143	100143	Monica	195	' Do n't you think it best that we should take some step before our happiness is irretrievably ruined ? '
100321	100348	100143	100143	Monica	195	' I see no need for its ruin . As I have told you before , in talking like that you degrade yourself and insult me . '
100349	100393	100143	100143	Monica	195	' I have my faults ; I know them only too well . One of them is that I can not bear you to make friends with people who are not of my kind . I shall never be able to endure that . '
100394	100404	100143	100143	Monica	195	' Of course you are speaking of Mr. Barfoot . '
100405	100408	100409	100409	he	2232	' Yes , '
100413	100434	100409	100409	he	2232	' It was a very unfortunate thing that I happened to come up just as he was in your company . '
100435	100442	100444	100444	Monica	195	' You are so very unreasonable , '
100447	100503	100444	100444	Monica	195	' What possible harm is there in Mr. Barfoot , when he meets me by chance in a public place , having a conversation with me ? I wish I knew twenty such men . Such conversation gives me a new interest in life . I have every reason to think well of Mr. Barfoot . '
100509	100513	100514	100514	he	217	' And I , '
100525	100602	100514	100514	he	217	' feel that I have every reason to dislike and suspect him . He is not an honest man ; his face tells me that . I know his life would n't bear inspection . You ca n't possibly be as good a judge as I am in such a case . Contrast him with Bevis . No , Bevis is a man one can trust ; one talk with him produces a lasting favourable impression . '
100622	100629	100630	100630	she	195	' Yet even with Mr. Bevis , '
100635	100704	100630	100630	she	195	' you do n't make friends . That is the fault in you which causes all this trouble . You have n't a sociable spirit . Your dislike of Mr. Barfoot only means that you do n't know him , and do n't wish to . And you are completely wrong in your judgment of him . I have every reason for being sure that you are wrong . '
100705	100718	100514	100514	he	217	' Of course you think so . In your ignorance of the world '
100719	100729	100730	100730	she	195	' Which you think very proper in a woman , '
100734	100750	100514	100514	he	217	' Yes , I do ! That kind of knowledge is harmful to a woman . '
100751	100764	100514	100514	he	217	' Then , please , how is she to judge her acquaintances ? '
100765	100782	100783	100783	He	2233	' A married woman must accept her husband 's opinion , at all events about men . '
100791	100809	100783	100783	He	2233	' A man may know with impunity what is injurious if it enters a woman 's mind . '
100810	100826	100827	100827	He	2233	' I do n't believe that . I ca n't and wo n't believe it . '
100834	100878	100514	100514	he	217	' We differ hopelessly . It was all very well to discuss these things when you could do so in a friendly spirit . Now you say whatever you know will irritate me , and you say it on purpose to irritate me . '
100879	100924	100827	100827	He	2233	' No ; indeed I do not . But you are quite right that I find it hard to be friendly with you . Most earnestly I wish to be your friend your true and faithful friend . But you wo n't let me . '
100925	100928	100929	100929	he	2233	' Friend ! '
100933	100966	100929	100929	he	2233	' The woman who has become my wife ought to be something more than a friend , I should think . You have lost all love for me there 's the misery . '
100974	100976	100984	100984	his	2233	' love '
101125	101132	101133	101133	he	2233	' You do n't love me , '
101141	101164	101133	101133	he	2233	' You wish to be my friend . That 's how you try to compensate me for the loss of your love . '
101170	101176	101177	101177	Monica	195	' When you say that , '
101180	101229	101177	101177	Monica	195	' do you ever ask yourself whether you try to make me love you ? Scenes like this are ruining my health . I have come to dread your talk . I have almost forgotten the sound of your voice when it is n't either angry or complaining . '
101243	101273	101241	101241	him	217	' That is why I have asked you to go away from here , Monica . We must have a new home if our life is to begin anew . '
101274	101308	101309	101309	He	217	' I have no faith in mere change of place . You would be the same man . If you can not command your senseless jealousy here , you never would anywhere else . '
101334	101357	101309	101309	He	217	' Can you honestly repeat to me what Barfoot was saying to - day , when you were on the seat together ? '
101363	101379	101309	101309	He	217	' I could ; every word . But I shall not try to do so . '
101380	101396	101309	101309	He	217	' Not if I beseech you to , Monica ? To put my mind at rest '
101397	101420	101309	101309	He	217	' No . When I tell you that you might have heard every syllable , I have said all that I shall . '
101708	101805	101700	101700	she	195	' Your behaviour seems to me very weak , very unmanly . You make us both miserable , and quite without cause . I can only say as I have said before , that things will never be better until you come to think of me as your free companion , not as your bond - woman . If you ca n't do this , you will make me wish that I had never met you , and in the end I am sure it wo n't be possible for us to go on living together . '
102688	102700	102702	102702	she	277	' We want to get rid of a lot of sham propriety '
102709	102761	102702	102702	she	277	' Girls must learn to trust themselves , and look out for dangers . If a girl can only be kept straight by incessant watchfulness , why , let her go where she will , and learn by experience . In fact , I want to see experience substituted for precept . '
102849	102853	102854	102854	she	197	' That house , '
102861	102870	102854	102854	she	197	' is nothing more than a matrimonial agency . '
102871	102883	102830	102830	she	197	' But so is every house where many people are entertained . '
102884	102934	102854	102854	she	197	' Not in the same way . Mrs. Cosgrove was speaking to me of some girl who has just accepted an offer of marriage . " I do n't think they 'll suit each other , " she said , " but there 's no harm in trying . " '
102943	102980	102830	102830	she	197	' Who knows ? Perhaps she is right in that view of things . After all , you know , it 's only putting into plain words what everybody thinks on all but every such occasion . '
102981	102990	102992	102992	Rhoda	197	' The first part of her remark yes , '
102995	103022	102992	102992	Rhoda	197	' But as for the " no harm in trying , " well , let us ask the wife 's opinion in a year 's time . '
103180	103190	103191	103191	she	265	' Your sisters are not here to - day ? '
103194	103214	103171	103171	he	289	' No . They have guests of their own . And when are you coming to see them again ? '
103215	103222	103171	103171	he	289	' Before long , I hope . '
103231	103239	103256	103256	his	289	' Do come next Saturday could you ? '
103240	103247	103256	103256	his	289	' I had better not promise . '
103248	103253	103254	103254	he	289	' Do try , and '
103258	103316	103256	103256	his	289	' come alone . Forgive me for saying that . The girls are rather afraid of Mr. Widdowson , that 's the truth . They would so like a free gossip with you . Let me tell them to expect you about half - past three or four . They will rise up and call me blessed . '
103621	103637	103616	103616	Widdowson	217	' I 've ordered the trap , Monica . Will you come for a drive ? '
103638	103649	103663	103663	his	217	' I have promised to go into the town . I 'm
103653	103653	103663	103663	his	217	'
103654	103660	103663	103663	his	217	' It does n't matter . '
103677	103691	103692	103692	he	217	' For a day or two I have n't felt at all well , '
103696	103706	103692	103692	he	217	' I thought a drive might do me good . '
103707	103723	103663	103663	his	217	' Certainly . I hope it will . When would you like to have dinner ? '
103724	103748	103692	103692	he	217	' I never care to alter the hours . Of course I shall be back at the usual time . Shall you be ? '
103749	103756	103663	103663	his	217	' Oh yes long before dinner . '
103824	103832	103819	103819	person	2297	' Delighted ! I thought it might be '
103870	103881	103882	103882	he	289	' My sisters will be here in a few minutes , '
103885	103912	103882	103882	he	289	' A few minutes at most . Will you take this chair , Mrs. Widdowson ? How delighted I am that you were able to come ! '
103984	104064	103982	103982	his	289	' arrival ; but in this little set of rooms it was doubtfully permissible for her to sit tete - a - tete with a young man , under any excuse . And the fact of his opening the front door himself seemed to suggest that not even a servant was in the flat . A tremor grew upon her as she talked , due in part to the consciousness that she was glad to be thus alone with Bevis .
104065	104079	104080	104080	he	289	' A place like this must seem to you to be very unhomelike , '
104097	104232	104080	104080	he	289	' The girls did n't like it at all at first . I suppose it 's a retrograde step in civilization . Servants are decidedly of that opinion ; we have a great difficulty in getting them to stay here . The reason seems to me that they miss the congenial gossip of the area door . At this moment we are without a domestic . I found she compensated herself for disadvantages by stealing my tobacco and cigars . She went to work with such a lack of discretion abstracting half a pound of honeydew at a time that I could n't find any sympathy for her . Moreover , when charged with the delinquency , she became abusive , so very abusive that we were obliged to insist upon her immediate departure . '
104233	104240	104242	104242	Monica	195	' Do you think she smoked ? '
104245	104306	104427	104427	He	289	' We have debated that point with much interest . She was a person of advanced ideas , as you see ; practically a communist . But I doubt whether honeydew had any charms for her personally . It seems more probable that some milkman , or baker 's assistant , or even metropolitan policeman , benefited by her communism . '
104338	104347	104348	104348	he	289	' But I have something to tell you , '
104355	104400	104348	104348	he	289	' I am going to leave England . They want me to live at Bordeaux for a tune , two or three years perhaps . It 's a great bore , but I shall have to go . I am not my own master . '
104401	104410	104427	104427	He	289	' Then your sisters will go to Guernsey ? '
104411	104426	104348	104348	he	289	' Yes . I dare say I shall leave about the end of July . '
104438	104452	104453	104453	Monica	195	' Do you think your sisters will soon be here , Mr. Bevis ? '
104463	104593	104427	104427	He	289	' I think so . Do you know , I did a very silly thing . I wanted your visit if you came to be a surprise for them , and so in fact , I said nothing about it . When I got here from business , a little before three , they were just going out . I asked them if they were sure they would be back in less than an hour . Oh , they were quite sure not a doubt about it . I do hope they have n't altered their mind , and gone to call somewhere . But , Mrs. Widdowson , I am going to make you a cup of tea with my own fair hands , as the novelist say . '
104618	104632	104633	104633	Bevis	289	' No , I ca n't , I ca n't let you go ! '
104646	104683	104641	104641	he	289	' How shall I entreat you ? If you knew what an unforgettable delight it will be to me to make you a cup of tea ! I shall think of it at Bordeaux every Saturday . '
104694	104703	104637	104637	his	289	' I really must go , Mr. Bevis ! '
104704	104789	104790	104790	His	2306	' Do n't drive me to despair . I am capable of turning my poor sisters out of house and home flat and home , I mean in anger at their delay . On their account , in pity for their youth , do stay , Mrs. Widdowson ! Besides , I have a new song that I want you to bear words and music my own . One little quarter of an hour ! And I know the girls will be here directly . '
105032	105043	105044	105044	she	195	' You have n't made Mr. Barfoot 's acquaintance yet ? '
105047	105071	105214	105214	He	2315	' No , I have n't . There seems to have been no opportunity . Did you seriously wish me to know him ? '
105072	105085	105214	105214	He	2315	' Oh , I had no wish in the matter at all . '
105086	105092	105214	105214	He	2315	' You like Mr. Barfoot ? '
105093	105100	105214	105214	He	2315	' I think him very pleasant . '
105101	105175	105214	105214	He	2315	' How delightful to be praised by you , Mrs. Widdowson ! Now if any one speaks to you about me , when I have left England , will you find some nice word ? Do n't think me foolish . I do so desire the good opinion of my friends . To know that you spoke of me as you did for Mr. Barfoot would give me a whole day of happiness . '
105176	105187	105214	105214	He	2315	' How enviable ! To be so easily made happy . '
105188	105213	105214	105214	He	2315	' Now let me sing you this song of mine . It is n't very good ; I have n't composed for years . But '
105288	105310	105268	105268	Bevis	289	' Quite a new sort of thing for me , Mrs. Widdowson . Does it strike you as so very bad ? '
105311	105317	105268	105268	Bevis	289	' No not at all . '
105318	105327	105328	105328	He	289	' But you ca n't honestly praise it ? '
105334	105384	105328	105328	He	289	' I meant to give you a copy . I made this one specially for you , and if you will forgive me I have taken the liberty of dedicating it to you . Songwriters do that , you know . Of course it is altogether unworthy of your acceptance '
105385	105409	105328	105328	He	289	' No no indeed I am very grateful to you , Mr. Bevis . Do give it to me as you meant to . '
105410	105416	105417	105417	he	289	' You will have it ? '
105421	105428	105417	105417	he	289	' Now for a triumphal march ! '
105464	105486	105447	105447	She	195	' Now I must say good - bye , Mr. Bevis . I am so sorry your sisters have n't come . '
105487	105509	105328	105328	He	289	' So am I and yet I am not . I have enjoyed the happiest half - hour of my life . '
105510	105520	105447	105447	She	195	' Will you give me the piece of music ? '
105521	105560	105328	105328	He	289	' Let me roll it up . There ; it wo n't be very awkward to carry . But of course I shall see you again before the end of July ? You will come some other afternoon ? '
105561	105574	105447	105447	She	195	' If Miss Bevis will let me know when she is quite sure '
105575	105631	105328	105328	He	289	' Yes , she shall . Do you know , I do n't think I shall say a word about what has happened this afternoon . Will you allow me to keep silence about your call , Mrs. Widdowson ? They would be so annoyed and really it was a silly thing not to tell them '
105653	105674	105328	105328	He	289	' Good - bye , then . You know what I told you about my tendency to low spirits . I 'm
105687	105687	105644	105644	Bevis	288	'
105717	105721	105722	105722	he	2316	' Thank you , '
105725	105733	105722	105722	he	2316	' Thank you for your great kindness . '
105824	105831	105816	105816	she	195	' Have you enjoyed your drive ? '
105832	105836	105816	105816	she	195	' Pretty well . '
105837	105844	105816	105816	she	195	' And do you feel better ? '
105845	105859	105816	105816	she	195	' Not much , dear . But it is n't worth talking about . '
105869	105878	105862	105862	he	2316	' I had an appointment with Milly Vesper . '
107393	107401	107402	107402	Mary	225	' What about your holiday this year ? '
107409	107419	107402	107402	Mary	225	' Shall you go first , or shall I ? '
107420	107428	107429	107430	Miss Barfoot	212	' Please make whatever arrangements you like . '
107464	107468	107469	107469	she	212	' Miss Vesper , '
107472	107494	107469	107469	she	212	' can manage your room very well . We shall be much more at ease in that respect than last year . '
107495	107509	107510	107510	Rhoda	197	' Yes . Miss Vesper is getting to be very useful and trustworthy . '
107519	107524	107525	107525	she	212	' Do you know , '
107529	107538	107525	107525	she	212	' whether she sees much of Mrs. Widdowson ? '
107539	107545	107567	107568	Miss Barfoot	212	' I have no idea . '
107574	107582	107584	107584	Rhoda	197	' I was thinking of it myself , '
107586	107639	107584	107584	Rhoda	197	' I should like to have some sea - bathing , though . A week by the shore , and then the rest of the time spent in vagabondage among the mountains , would suit me very well . Mrs. Cosgrove is at home in Cumberland ; I must ask her advice . '
107747	107806	107713	107713	Wastdale	149	' There are one or two bathing - machines , Mrs. Cosgrove says , but I hope to avoid such abominations . How delicious it was in one 's childhood , when one ran into the sea naked ! I will enjoy that sensation once more , if I have to get up at three in the morning . '
107879	107891	107892	107892	Barfoot	225	' Have you planned a route after your stay at Seascale ? '
107895	107907	107911	107911	he	2363	' No . I shall do that when I am there . '
108235	108246	108248	108248	Rhoda	197	' You must feel rather lonely in your lodgings sometimes ? '
108250	108292	108248	108248	Rhoda	197	' Very rarely . In future I shall have music in the evening . Our best room has been let to a young man who has a violin , and he plays " The Blue Bells of Scotland " not badly . '
108313	108322	108293	108293	Rhoda	197	' Does Mrs. Widdowson come to see you ? '
108323	108334	108293	108293	Rhoda	197	' Not often . She came a few days ago . '
108335	108343	108293	108293	Rhoda	197	' You go to her house sometimes ? '
108344	108370	108293	108293	Rhoda	197	' I have n't been there for several months . At first I used to go rather frequently , but it 's a long way . '
108390	108420	108374	108374	Rhoda	197	' Mrs. Widdowson comes here now and then , and we are always very glad to see her . But I ca n't help thinking she looks rather unhappy . '
108421	108423	108293	108293	Rhoda	197	' I 'm
108428	108433	108293	108293	Rhoda	197	' assented the other gravely .
108434	108472	108374	108374	Rhoda	197	' You and I were both at her wedding . It was n't very cheerful , was it ? I had a disagreeable sense of bad omens all the time . Do you think she is sorry ? '
108473	108475	108293	108293	Rhoda	197	' I 'm
108481	108481	108293	108293	Rhoda	197	'
108491	108527	108374	108374	Rhoda	197	' Foolish girl ! Why could n't she stay with us , and keep her liberty ? She does n't seem to have made any new friends . Has she spoken to you of any ? '
108528	108537	108374	108374	Rhoda	197	' Only of people she has met here . '
108564	108604	108559	108559	she	197	' Can you help to put my mind at rest about Monica ? You saw her a week ago . Did she say anything , or give any sign , that might make one really uneasy on her account ? '
108617	108623	108615	108615	Rhoda	197	' Perhaps you had rather not '
108624	108657	108615	108615	Rhoda	197	' Yes , I had rather tell you . She said a good many strange things , and I have been uneasy about her . I wished I could speak to some one '
108658	108672	108674	108674	Rhoda	197	' How strange that I should feel urged to ask you about this , '
108691	108713	108674	108674	Rhoda	197	' The poor thing is very miserable , I am sure . Her husband seems to leave her entirely to herself . '
108718	108735	108615	108615	Rhoda	197	' Monica made quite the opposite complaint to me . She said that was a prisoner . '
108736	108752	108615	108615	Rhoda	197	' That 's very odd . She certainly goes about a good deal and alone . '
108753	108760	108762	108762	Milly	234	' I did n't know that , '
108764	108811	108762	108762	Milly	234	' She has very often talked to me about a woman 's right to the same freedom as a man , and I always understood that Mr. Widdowson objected to her going anywhere without him , except just to call here , or at my lodgings . '
108812	108824	108615	108615	Rhoda	197	' Do you think she has any acquaintance that he dislikes ? '
108837	108852	108615	108615	Rhoda	197	' There is some one . She has n't told me who it is . '
108853	108867	108762	108762	Milly	234	' In plain words , Mr. Widdowson thinks he has cause for jealousy ? '
108868	108878	108615	108615	Rhoda	197	' Yes , I understand Monica to mean that . '
108893	108904	108887	108887	She	197	' But you do n't think she could deceive him ? '
108905	108914	108916	108917	Miss Vesper	235	' Oh , I ca n't think that ! '
108923	108974	108916	108917	Miss Vesper	235	' But what I could n't help fearing , after I saw her last , was that she might almost be tempted to leave her husband . She spoke so much of freedom and of a woman 's right to release herself if she found her marriage was a mistake . '
108975	109026	108887	108887	She	197	' I am so grateful to you for telling me all this . We must try to help her . Of course I will make no mention of you , Miss Vesper . Then you are really under the impression that there 's some one she prefers to her husband ? '
109027	109036	108916	108917	Miss Vesper	235	' I ca n't help thinking there is , '
109043	109081	108916	108917	Miss Vesper	235	' I was so sorry for her , and felt so powerless . She cried a little . All I could do was to entreat her not to behave rashly . I thought her sister ought to know '
109082	109101	108887	108887	She	197	' Oh , Miss Madden is useless . Monica can not look to her for advice or support . '
109297	109361	109283	109283	She	197	' I see you limit me to ten miles a day . In such scenery of course one does n't hurry on , but I ca n't help informing you that twenty miles would n't alarm me . I think it very likely that I shall follow your itinerary , after my week of bathing and idling . I leave on Monday week . '
109409	109433	109402	109402	her	197	' her thoughts . On the Sunday before her departure she took a sudden resolve and went to call upon Monica at Herne Hill .
109451	109458	109461	109461	he	249	' Is Mr. Widdowson at home ? '
109633	109644	109646	109646	Widdowson	265	' No , she is not in very good health , '
109649	109665	109646	109646	Widdowson	265	' She has gone this afternoon to Mrs. Cosgrove 's I think you know her . '
109701	109712	109736	109736	He	2386	' Shall you be leaving town shortly , Mr. Widdowson ? '
109713	109735	109736	109736	He	2386	' We are not quite sure But pray sit down , Miss Nunn . You have n't seen my wife lately ? '
109756	109775	109736	109736	He	2386	' Mrs. Widdowson has n't been to see us for more than a month if I remember rightly . '
109784	109804	109736	109736	He	2386	' A month ? But I thought I had an idea that she went only a few days ago . '
109805	109811	109836	109836	Rhoda	197	' In the day time ? '
109812	109835	109736	109736	He	2386	' To Great Portland Street , I mean to hear a lecture , or something of that kind , by Miss Barfoot . '
109847	109859	109844	109844	she	197	' Oh yes very likely I was n't there that afternoon . '
109860	109867	109868	109868	He	2386	' I see . That would explain '
109914	109948	109901	109901	he	2386	' We are going to leave London altogether . I have decided to take a house at my wife 's native place , Clevedon . Her sisters will come and live with us . '
109949	109959	109901	109901	he	2386	' That is a recent decision , Mr. Widdowson ? '
109960	109979	109901	109901	he	2386	' I have thought about it for some time . London does n't suit Monica 's health ; I 'm
109994	109994	109901	109901	he	2386	'
109995	110004	109901	109901	he	2386	' Yes , I think that very likely . '
110005	110026	110027	110027	He	2390	' As you say that you have noticed her changed looks , I shall lose no time in getting away . '
110036	110088	110027	110027	He	2390	' A few weeks . We will go down to Clevedon at once and find a house . Yes , we will go to - morrow , or the day after . Miss Madden , also , is very far from well . I wish I had n't delayed so long . '
110089	110135	109901	109901	he	2386	' You are doing very wisely , I think . I had meant to suggest something of this kind to Mrs. Widdowson . Perhaps , if I went at once to Mrs. Cosgrove 's , I might be fortunate enough to find her still there ? '
110136	110171	110027	110027	He	2390	' You might . Did I understand you to say that you go away tomorrow ? For three weeks . Ah , then we may be getting ready to remove when you come back . '
110420	110425	110427	110428	Miss Barfoot	212	' What has happened ? '
110436	110445	110427	110428	Miss Barfoot	212	' Happened ? Nothing that I know of . '
110446	110452	110427	110428	Miss Barfoot	212	' You look very strange . '
110453	110471	110427	110428	Miss Barfoot	212	' Your imagination . I have been packing ; perhaps it 's from stooping over the trunk . '
110574	110584	110591	110591	he	242	' I have been in the country all day , '
110638	110647	110630	110630	Rhoda	197	' Have you really been out of town ? '
110648	110655	110662	110662	She	197	' Why should you doubt it ? '
110656	110661	110630	110630	Rhoda	197	' As I told you .
110679	110719	110672	110672	Everard	242	' I want to ask your leave to meet you somewhere during these next three weeks . At any point on your route . We could have a day 's ramble together , and then say good - bye . '
110720	110732	110662	110662	She	197	' The lake country is free to you , Mr. Barfoot . '
110733	110750	110672	110672	Everard	242	' But I must n't miss you . You will leave Seascale to - morrow week ? '
110751	110776	110662	110662	She	197	' At present I think so . But I ca n't restrict myself by any agreement . Holiday must be a time of liberty . '
110798	110812	110792	110792	he	242	' To - morrow week , then , perhaps we may meet again . '
110831	110846	110822	110822	her	197	' I wo n't stay longer this evening . A pleasant journey to you ! '
111641	111645	111646	111646	Bevis	288	' The girls , '
111650	111684	111646	111646	Bevis	288	' leave on Thursday . The rest of the week I shall be alone . On Monday the furniture will be stowed away at the Pantechnicon , and on Tuesday off I go . '
111750	111759	111737	111737	he	5036	' Come on Friday afternoon about four o'clock . '
111780	111816	111760	111760	Her	195	' Do come once more for the last time . It shall be just as before just as before . An hour 's talk , and we will say good - bye to each other . '
111878	111899	111900	111900	his	5036	' I shall expect you . I know you wo n't refuse me this one last kindness . Some day , '
111907	111913	111900	111900	his	5036	' some day who knows ? '
111933	111945	111930	111930	she	195	' On Friday , at four . I shall expect you . '
112021	112025	112026	112026	he	5036	' Back already ? '
112034	112050	112026	112026	he	5036	' Be quick , and take your things off , and come to the library . '
112116	112123	112125	112125	his	5036	' Miss Nunn has been here , '
112148	112167	112264	112264	he	2438	' She wanted to see you because she is going away on Monday . What 's the matter ? '
112168	112175	112264	112264	he	2438	' Nothing . You spoke so strangely '
112176	112230	112264	112264	he	2438	' Did I ? And you look very strangely . I do n't understand you . Miss Nunn says that everybody has noticed how ill you seem . It 's time we did something . To - morrow morning we are going down into Somerset , to Clevedon , to find a house . '
112231	112241	112264	112264	he	2438	' I thought you had given up that idea . '
112242	112252	112264	112264	he	2438	' Whether I had or not does n't matter . '
112280	112320	112264	112264	he	2438	' I am decided on it now . There 's a train to Bristol at ten - twenty . You will pack just a few things ; we sha n't be away for more than a day or two . '
112378	112387	112388	112388	she	195	' Why are you talking in this tone ? '
112392	112437	112388	112388	she	195	' What tone ? I am telling you what I have decided to do , that 's all . I shall easily find a house down there , no doubt . Knowing the place , you will be able to suggest the likely localities . '
112448	112454	112455	112455	Widdowson	265	' It 's quite true , '
112466	112486	112455	112455	Widdowson	265	' You are beginning to look like a ghost . Oh , we 'll have an end of this ! '
112493	112523	112487	112487	He	2440	' Not a day 's unnecessary delay ! Write to both your sisters this evening and tell them . I wish them both to come and live with us . '
112524	112528	112591	112591	Monica	195	' Very well . '
112529	112547	112487	112487	He	2440	' Now , wo n't you be glad ? Wo n't it be better in every way ? '
112559	112565	112566	112566	she	195	' I told you before , '
112569	112577	112566	112566	she	195	' to do just as you liked . '
112578	112590	112548	112548	He	2440	' And you wo n't talk about being kept a prisoner ? '
112594	112606	112591	112591	Monica	195	' Oh no , I wo n't say anything at all . '
112662	112679	112634	112634	She	195	' You know we could n't go on living like this do n't you , Monica ? '
112680	112687	112634	112634	She	195	' No , we could n't . '
112688	112692	112693	112693	He	2440	' You see ! '
112707	112759	112693	112693	He	2440	' All that was needed was resolution on my part . I have been absurdly weak , and weakness in the husband means unhappiness in the wife . From today you look to me for guidance . I am no tyrant , but I shall rule you for your own good . '
112764	112796	112761	112761	she	195	' So there 's an end of our misery is n't it , darling ? What misery ! Good God , how I have suffered ! Have n't you known it ? '
112797	112805	112761	112761	she	195	' I have known it too well . '
112806	112820	112761	112761	she	195	' And now you will make up to me for it , Monica ? '
112832	112841	112828	112828	she	195	' I will do the best for both . '
112857	112991	112844	112844	himself	2441	' No , that is my own dear wife once more ! Your face has altogether changed . See how right it is that a husband should take the law into his own hands ! Our second year of marriage shall be very different from the first . And yet we were happy , were n't we , my beautiful ? It 's only this cursed London that has come between us . At Clevedon we shall begin our life over again like we did at Guernsey . All our trouble , I am convinced , has come of your ill - health . This air has never suited you ; you have felt miserable , and could n't be at peace in your home . Poor little girl ! My poor darling ! '
113119	113173	113174	113174	He	2442	' To - morrow we will go straight home and make our preparations for removal . When all is ready , you shall come down here and live at the hotel until the house is furnished . Go to your sister Virginia and simply bid her do as you wish . Imitate me ! '
113178	113198	113174	113174	He	2442	' Do n't listen to any objection . When you have once got her away she will thank you . '
113387	113404	113373	113373	he	2442	' Well , now , you will go and see your sister to - morrow morning . '
113405	113413	113373	113373	he	2442	' In the afternoon , I think . '
113414	113431	113373	113373	he	2442	' Why ? Do n't let us have any procrastination . The morning , the morning ! '
113432	113447	113448	113448	Monica	195	' Please do let me have my way in such a trifle as that , '
113452	113469	113448	113448	Monica	195	' I have all sorts of things to see to here before I can go out . '
113474	113498	113448	113448	Monica	195	' You sha n't say that I am unreasonable . In the afternoon , then . And do n't listen to any objections . '
113499	113504	113470	113470	He	2442	' No , no . '
113737	113768	113730	113731	the landlady	447	' Please ask her not to come to Herne Hill until she hears from me , as I am not likely to be at home for a day or two . '

I am deceiving him I have deceived him for a long time , pretending to be a faithful wife when I have often wished that he might die and release me . It is I who am to blame . I ought to have left him . Every woman who thinks of her husband as I do ought to go away from him . It is base and wicked to stay there pretending deceiving '

Oh , I must live somewhere in secret until you go , and then I have put aside the few things that I want to take . I could never have continued to live with him even if you had n't said you love me . I was obliged to pretend that I agreed to everything , but I will beg and starve rather than bear that misery any longer . Do n't you love me enough to face whatever may happen ? '

But it would be so much better if you could wait here until I Oh , what a wretched thing to have to seem so cowardly to you ! But the difficulties are so great , darling . I shall be a perfect stranger in Bordeaux . I do n't even speak the language at all well . When I reach there I shall be met at the station by one of our people , and just think , how could we manage ? You know , if it were discovered that I had run away with you , it would damage my position terribly . I ca n't say what might happen . My darling , we shall have to be very careful . In a few weeks it might all be managed very easily . I would write to you to some address , and as soon as ever I had made arrangements '

117278	117284	117285	117285	Bevis	288	' I dare n't open , '

The journey wo n't be very difficult for you ; and think how much better , dear Monica , if we can escape discovery , and live for each other without any shame or fear to disturb us . You will be my own dear true wife . I will love and guard you as long as I live . '

118184	118189	118181	118181	he	2501	' like a gentleman . '

119685	119714	119678	119678	he	217	' Pity she should be serving at a bar hearing doubtful talk , and seeing very often vile sights . A nice , soft - spoken little girl . '
119847	119909	119825	119825	He	217	' genuine happiness of soul had that love afforded him ? The minutest fraction of the twelve months for which she had been his wife . And of suffering , often amounting to frantic misery , he could count many weeks . Could such a marriage as this be judged a marriage at all , in any true sense of the word ?
119910	120120	120168	120168	he	217	' Let me ask myself a question . If Monica were absolutely free to choose between continuing to live with me and resuming her perfect liberty , can I persuade myself that she would remain my wife ? She would not . Not for a day , not for an hour . Of that I am morally convinced . And I acknowledge the grounds of her dissatisfaction . We are unsuited to each other . We do not understand each other . Our marriage is physical and nothing more . My love what is my love ? I do not love her mind , her intellectual part . If I did , this frightful jealousy from which I suffer would be impossible . My ideal of the wife perfectly suited to me is far liker that girl at the public - house bar than Monica . Monica 's independence of thought is a perpetual irritation to me . I do n't know what her thoughts really are , what her intellectual life signifies . And yet I hold her to me with the sternest grasp . If she endeavoured to release herself I should feel capable of killing her . Is not this a strange , a brutal thing ? '

120645	120660	120635	120636	Mrs. Conisbee	206	' Not very well ? But could n't I see her for a moment ? '
120671	120680	120681	120681	she	191	' Some one for me , Mrs. Conisbee ? '
120686	120700	120681	120681	she	191	' Oh , is it you , Edmund ? So very glad ! I 'm
120747	120751	120752	120752	She	191	'm really hardly able '
120835	120845	120846	120846	Virginia	191	' It is so foolish of me , Edmund , '
120861	121133	120846	120846	Virginia	191	' When I am away from home I forget all about my meals really forget and then all at once I find that I am quite exhausted quite exhausted as you see . And the worst of it is I have altogether lost my appetite by the time I get back . I could n't eat a mouthful of food not a mouthful I assure you I could n't . And it does so distress good Mrs. Conisbee . She is exceedingly kind to me exceedingly careful about my health . Oh , and in Battersea Park Road I saw such a shocking sight ; a great cart ran over a poor little dog , and it was killed on the spot . It unnerved me dreadfully . I do think , Edmund , those drivers ought to be more careful . I was saying to Mrs. Conisbee only the other day and that reminds me , I do so want to know all about your visit to Clevedon . Dear , dear Clevedon ! And have you really taken a house there , Edmund ? Oh , if we could all end our days at Clevedon ! You know that our dear father and mother are buried in the old churchyard . You remember Tennyson 's lines about the old church at Clevedon ? Oh , and what did Monica decide about about really , what was I going to ask ? It is so foolish of me to forget that dinner - time has come and gone . I get so exhausted , and even my memory fails me . '
121166	121174	121175	121175	he	2578	' I only wished to tell you , '
121179	121188	121175	121175	he	2578	' that we have taken a house at Clevedon '
121189	121194	121195	121195	She	2579	' You really have ! '
121201	121204	121195	121195	She	2579	' Whereabouts ? '
121205	121210	121175	121175	he	2578	' Near Dial Hill . '
121232	121245	121175	121175	he	2578	' Perhaps you had better come and see us to - morrow . '
121246	121278	121175	121175	he	2578	' But Monica left a message that she would n't be at home for the next few days , and that I was n't to come till I heard from her . '
121279	121291	121175	121175	he	2578	' Not at home ? I think there 's a mistake . '
121292	121303	121175	121175	he	2578	' Oh , impossible ! We 'll ask Mrs. Conisbee . '
121329	121351	121360	121360	he	217	' She shall write to you then . Do n't come just yet . I must n't stay any longer now . '
121533	121589	121521	121521	she	195	' waiting - room for the purpose of bathing her face . She had red , swollen eyes , and her hair was in slight disorder . This done , she inquired as to the next train for Herne Hill . One had just gone ; another would leave in about a quarter of an hour .
122255	122261	122245	122245	He	217	' So you are back ? '
122262	122274	122245	122245	He	217	' Yes . I hope you did n't expect me sooner . '
122275	122283	122284	122284	He	217	' Oh , it 's all right . '
122295	122306	122284	122284	He	217	' Had a long talk with Virginia , I suppose ? '
122307	122317	122347	122347	he	217	' Yes . I could n't get away before . '
122371	122378	122347	122347	he	217	' Does she consent to go ? '
122400	122406	122408	122409	the other	462	' You look very tired , '
122411	122417	122387	122387	she	195	' I am , very . '
122555	122560	122545	122545	he	217	' Hypocrite ! Liar ! '
122665	122676	122677	122677	he	217	' I want to be in the City at nine , '
122686	122697	122677	122677	he	217	' There 's a money affair I must see after . '
122698	122705	122654	122654	her	195	' Something that 's going wrong ? '
122706	122708	122677	122677	he	217	' I 'm
122731	122731	122725	122725	you	217	'
122732	122736	122654	122654	her	195	' None whatever . '
122737	122761	122725	122725	you	217	' It 's Saturday , you know . I promised to see Newdick this afternoon . Perhaps I may bring him to dinner . '
125047	125057	125034	125034	He	217	' How late you are ! Are you alone ? '
125058	125063	125034	125034	He	217	' Yes , alone . '
125064	125071	125034	125034	He	217	' You have n't had dinner ? '
125072	125075	125034	125034	He	217	' No . '
125105	125115	125094	125094	He	217	' Have you had bad news in the City ? '
125116	125122	125124	125124	he	217	' Yes , I have . '
125146	125154	125140	125140	his	217	' Have you been out this afternoon ? '
125175	125185	125171	125171	he	217	' Yes , I went to see Miss Barfoot . '
125186	125189	125171	125171	he	217	' Liar ! '
125279	125282	125286	125286	him	217	' Liar ! '
125288	125302	125286	125286	him	217	' Day after day you have lied to me . Liar ! Adultress ! '
125303	125313	125314	125314	She	195	' I am not ! I am not that ! '
125352	125404	125413	125413	he	217	' Not that ? What is your word worth ? The prostitute in the street is sooner to be believed . She has the honesty to say what she is , but you Where were you yesterday when you were not at your sister 's ? Where were you this afternoon ? '
125431	125447	125413	125413	he	217	' Where were you ? Tell the truth , or you shall never speak again ! '
125448	125459	125413	125413	he	217	' Oh help ! help ! He will kill me ! '
125467	125523	125460	125460	Her	195	' Call them up let them come and look at you and hear what you are . Soon enough every one will know . Where were you this afternoon ? You were watched every step of the way from here to that place where you have made yourself a base , vile , unclean creature . '
125524	125536	125413	125413	he	217	' I am not that ! Your spies have misled you . '
125537	125573	125460	125460	Her	195	' Misled ? Did n't you go to that man Barfoot 's door and knock there ? And because you were disappointed , did n't you wait about , and go there a second time ? '
125574	125588	125413	125413	he	217	' What if I did ? It does n't mean what you think . '
125589	125616	125460	125460	Her	195	' What ? You go time after time to the private chambers of an unmarried man a man such as that and it means no harm ? '
125617	125625	125413	125413	he	217	' I have never been there before . '
125626	125634	125635	125635	Widdowson	217	' You expect me to believe you ? '
125671	125701	125667	125667	her	2714	' When did your lies begin ? Was it when you told me you had been to hear Miss Barfoot 's lecture , and never went there at all ? '
125722	125741	125711	125711	her	2714	' For how many weeks , for how many months , have you been dishonouring me and yourself ? '
125742	125796	125707	125708	a venture	2715	' I am not guilty of what you believe , but I sha n't try to defend myself . Thank Heaven , this is the end of everything between us ! Charge me with what you like . I am going away from you , and I hope we may never meet again . '
125797	125840	125841	125841	Both	525	' Yes , you are going no doubt of that . But not before you have answered my questions . Whether with lies or not does n't matter much . You shall give your own account of what you have been doing . '
125921	125929	125930	125930	Monica	195	' I shall answer no question whatever , '
125933	125949	125930	125930	Monica	195	' All I want is to leave your house , and never see you again . '
126175	126191	126192	126192	he	217	' You say you were never at that man 's rooms before to - day ? '
126199	126218	126192	126192	he	217	' What I have said you must take the trouble to recollect . I shall answer no question . '
126265	126271	126272	126272	she	195	' Stay where you are ! '
126275	126299	126272	126272	she	195	' If your hands touch me again I shall call for help until someone comes up . I wo n't endure your touch ! '
126300	126313	126344	126344	She	195	' Do you pretend you are innocent of any crime against me ? '
126314	126343	126272	126272	she	195	' I am not what you called me . Explain everything as you like . I will explain nothing . I want only to be free from you . '
126391	126397	126398	126398	he	217	' Where are you going ? '
126410	126422	126398	126398	he	217	' It is nothing to you . I am going away . '
126439	126447	126423	126423	They	2729	' No , that you shall not ! '
126506	126520	126502	126502	Widdowson	217	' Make what scandal you like , you do n't leave this house . '
126581	126588	126590	126590	her	195	' For scandal I care nothing , '
126593	126604	126590	126590	her	195	' One way or another I will leave the house . '
126605	126611	126590	126590	her	195	' Where are you going ? '
126612	126618	126590	126590	her	195	' To my sister 's . '
126888	126896	126897	126897	he	217	' Will you please to tell me , '
126899	126906	126897	126897	he	217	' whether Mrs. Widdowson is here ? '
126928	126940	126920	126920	she	5196	' Yes , sir . Mrs. Widdowson is with her sister , '
126941	126945	126920	126920	she	5196	' Thank you . '
128492	128504	128505	128505	she	197	' Did you know me before I happened to look round ? '
128509	128540	128478	128478	He	242	' Of course I did . Up there by the station I caught sight of you . Who else bears herself as you do with splendid disdain of common mortals ? '
128541	128554	128478	128478	He	242	' Please do n't make me think that my movements are ridiculous . '
128555	128578	128478	128478	He	242	' They are superb . The sea has already touched your cheeks . But I am afraid you have had abominable weather . '
128579	128599	128478	128478	He	242	' Yes , rather bad ; but there 's hope to - day . Where do you come from ? '
128600	128645	128478	128478	He	242	' By train , only from Carnforth . I left London yesterday morning , and stopped at Morecambe some people I know are there . As trains were awkward to - day , I drove from Morecambe to Carnforth . Did you expect me ? '
128646	128659	128478	128478	He	242	' I thought you might come , as you spoke of it . '
128660	128703	128478	128478	He	242	' How I have got through the week I could n't tell you . I should have been here days ago , but I was afraid . Let us go nearer to the sea . I was afraid of making you angry . '
128704	128714	128478	128478	He	242	' It 's better to keep one 's word . '
128715	128743	128478	128478	He	242	' Of course it is . And I am all the more delighted to be with you for the miserable week of waiting . Have you bathed ? '
128744	128749	128478	128478	He	242	' Once or twice . '
128750	128770	128478	128478	He	242	' I had a swim this morning before breakfast , in pouring rain . Now you ca n't swim . '
128771	128786	128478	128478	He	242	' No . I ca n't . But why were you sure about it ? '
128787	128881	128478	128478	He	242	' Only because it 's so rare for any girl to learn swimming . A man who ca n't swim is only half the man he might be , and to a woman I should think it must be of even more benefit . As in everything else , women are trammelled by their clothes ; to be able to get rid of them , and to move about with free and brave exertion of all the body , must tend to every kind of health , physical , mental , and mortal . '
128882	128890	128892	128892	Rhoda	197	' Yes , I quite believe that , '
128899	128938	128478	128478	He	242	' I spoke rather exultantly , did n't I ? I like to feel myself superior to you in some things . You have so often pointed out to me what a paltry , ineffectual creature I am . '
128939	128953	128478	128478	He	242	' I do n't remember ever using those words , or implying them . '
128954	128963	128965	128965	Everard	242	' How does the day stand with you ? '
128973	128980	128965	128965	Everard	242	' Have you still to dine ? '
128981	129003	128478	128478	He	242	' My dining is a very simple matter ; it happens at one o'clock . About nine I shall have supper . '
129004	129017	128965	128965	Everard	242	' Let us walk a little then . And may I smoke ? '
129018	129022	128478	128478	He	242	' Why not ? '
129060	129068	128965	128965	Everard	242	' To - morrow you leave here ? '
129069	129072	129073	129073	Rhoda	197	' Yes , '
129076	129096	129073	129073	Rhoda	197	' I shall go by railway to Coniston , and walk from there towards Helvellyn , as you suggested . '
129097	129229	128965	128965	Everard	242	' I have something else to propose . A man I talked to in the train told me of a fine walk in this neighbourhood . From Ravenglass , just below here , there 's a little line runs up Eskdale to a terminus at the foot of Scawfell , a place called Boot . From Boot one can walk either over the top of Scawfell or by a lower track to Wastdale Head . It 's very grand , wild country , especially the last part , the going down to Wastwater , and not many miles in all . Suppose we have that walk to - morrow ? From Wastdale we could drive back to Seascale in the evening , and then the next day just as you like . '
129230	129239	129073	129073	Rhoda	197	' Are you quite sure about the distances ? '
129240	129257	129258	129258	He	2818	' Quite . I have the Ordnance map in my pocket . Let me show you . '
129278	129318	129073	129073	Rhoda	197	' We must take something to eat ; I 'll provide for that . And at the Wastdale Head hotel we can have dinner about three or four , probably . It would be enjoyable , would n't it ? '
129319	129326	129073	129073	Rhoda	197	' If it does n't rain . '
129327	129358	129073	129073	Rhoda	197	' We 'll hope it wo n't . As we go back we can look out the trains at the station . No doubt there 's one soon after breakfast . '
129396	129406	129407	129407	Barfoot	242	' Wo n't you come out again after supper ? '
129410	129417	129073	129073	Rhoda	197	' Not again to - night . '
129418	129426	129427	129427	he	242	' For a quarter of an hour , '
129430	129439	129427	129427	he	242	' Just down to the sea and back . '
129440	129457	129073	129073	Rhoda	197	' I have been walking all day . I shall be glad to rest and read . '
129458	129467	129427	129427	he	242	' Very well . To - morrow morning . '
129792	129798	129800	129800	Everard	242	' If your strength fails , '
129815	129838	129800	129800	Everard	242	' there is no human help . I should have to choose between carrying you back to Boot or on to Wastdale . '
129839	129851	129800	129800	Everard	242	' My strength is not likely to fail sooner than yours , '
129857	129893	129800	129800	Everard	242	' I have chicken sandwiches , and wine that maketh glad the heart of man . Tell me when hunger overcomes you . I should think we had better make our halt at Burmoor Tarn . '
130039	130056	130058	130058	Barfoot	242	' Now this is just what I have enjoyed in imagination for a year or more , '
130087	130103	130067	130067	he	242	' An ideal realized , for once in one 's life . A perfect moment . '
130104	130118	130058	130058	Barfoot	242	' Do n't you like the scent of burning peat from that cottage ? '
130119	130144	130067	130067	he	242	' Yes . I like everything about us , in heaven and earth , and most of all I like your companionship , Rhoda . '
130177	130185	130186	130186	he	242	' Is mine as agreeable to you ? '
130201	130214	130186	130186	he	242	' Or do you just tolerate me out of good - nature ? '
130215	130241	130058	130058	Barfoot	242	' I have liked your companionship all the way from Seascale . Do n't disturb my enjoyment of it for the rest of the way . '
130242	130290	130186	130186	he	242	' That would be a misfortune indeed . The whole day shall be perfect . Not a note of discord . But I must have liberty to say what comes into my mind , and when you do n't choose to answer I shall respect your silence . '
130291	130305	130058	130058	Barfoot	242	' Would n't you like to smoke a cigar before we start again ? '
130306	130330	130186	130186	he	242	' Yes . But I like still better not to . The scent of peat is pleasanter to you than that of tobacco . '
130331	130339	130058	130058	Barfoot	242	' Oblige me by lighting the cigar . '
130340	130344	130345	130345	He	242	' If you command '
130350	130389	130345	130345	He	242	' The whole day shall be perfect . A delightful dinner at the inn , a drive to Seascale , an hour or two of rest , and then one more quiet talk by the sea at nightfall . '
130390	130402	130058	130058	Barfoot	242	' All but the last . I shall be too tired . '
130403	130500	130345	130345	He	242	' No . I must have that hour of talk by the sea . You are free to answer me or not , but your presence you must grant me . We are in an ideal world remember . We care nothing for all the sons and daughters of men . You and I will spend this one day together between cloudless heaven and silent earth a memory for lifetime . At nightfall you will come out again , and meet me down by the sea , where you stood when I first saw you yesterday . '
130518	130523	130524	130524	he	2860	' What an opportunity , '
130537	130546	130524	130524	he	2860	' for saying the silliest of conceivable things ! '
130547	130556	130058	130058	Barfoot	242	' What might that be , I wonder ? '
130557	130587	130524	130524	he	2860	' Why , that to dwell there together for the rest of our lives would be supreme felicity . You know the kind of man that would say that . '
130588	130595	130058	130058	Barfoot	242	' Not personally , thank goodness ! '
130596	130682	130524	130524	he	2860	' A week a month , even with weather such as this . Nay , with a storm for variety ; clouds from the top of Scawfell falling thick about us ; a fierce wind shrieking across the tarn ; sheets and torrents and floods of rain beating upon our roof ; and you and I by the peat - fire . With a good supply of books , old and new , I can picture it for three months , for half a year ! '
130683	130697	130058	130058	Barfoot	242	' Be on your guard . Remember " that kind of man " . '
130698	130731	130524	130524	he	2860	' I am in no danger . There is a vast difference between six months and all one 's life . When the half - year was over we would leave England . '
130732	130738	130058	130058	Barfoot	242	' By the Orient Express ? '
130760	130818	130524	130524	he	2860	' By the Orient Express . We would have a house by the Bosphorus for the next half - year , and contrast our emotions with those we had known by Burmoor Tarn . Think what a rich year of life that would make ! How much we should have learnt from nature and from each other ! '
130819	130831	130739	130739	They	2863	' And how dreadfully tired of each other we should be ! '
130847	130852	130853	130853	he	242	' You mean that ? '
130856	130863	130524	130524	he	2860	' You know it is true . '
130864	130910	130911	130911	He	242	' Hush ! The day is to be perfect . I wo n't admit that we could ever tire of each other with reasonable variety of circumstance . You to me are infinitely interesting , and I believe that I might become so to you . '
131243	131249	131251	131251	Everard	242	' It is six o'clock , '
131258	131272	131251	131251	Everard	242	' You remember your arrangement . At eight , down on the shore . '
131273	131287	131334	131334	Rhoda	197	' I should be much more comfortable in the armchair with a book . '
131288	131304	131251	131251	Everard	242	' Oh , you have had enough of books . It 's time to live . '
131305	131312	131334	131334	Rhoda	197	' It 's time to rest . '
131313	131333	131251	131251	Everard	242	' Are you so very tired ? Poor girl ! The day has been rather too much for you . '
131337	131350	131334	131334	Rhoda	197	' I could walk back again to Wastwater if it were necessary . '
131351	131367	131334	131334	Rhoda	197	' Of course ; I knew that . You are magnificent . At eight o'clock then '
131835	131847	131831	131831	she	197	' Did you see the light of sunset on the mountains ? '
131848	131851	131852	131852	he	242	' Yes , '
131855	131866	131831	131831	she	197	' There has been no such evening since I came . '
131867	131888	131831	131831	she	197	' And you wanted to sit at home with a book . That was no close for a perfect day . '
131889	131907	131831	131831	she	197	' I found a letter from your cousin . She was with her friends the Goodalls yesterday . '
131908	131917	131831	131831	she	197	' The Goodalls I used to know them . '
131918	131921	131831	131831	she	197	' Yes . '
131944	131953	131831	131831	she	197	' How does Mary get on without you ? '
131954	131960	131831	131831	she	197	' There 's no difficulty . '
131961	131972	131831	131831	she	197	' Has she any one capable of taking your place ? '
131973	131985	131831	131831	she	197	' Yes . Miss Vesper can do all that 's necessary . '
131986	131999	131831	131831	she	197	' Even to inspiring the girls with zeal for an independent life ? '
132000	132005	131831	131831	she	197	' Perhaps even that . '
132032	132041	132042	132042	he	242	' To - morrow we go to Coniston ? '
132052	132057	132047	132047	he	242	' You are going ? '
132058	132067	132068	132068	Rhoda	197	' Do you think I can leave you ? '
132087	132096	132097	132097	he	242	' Do you wish me to leave you ? '
132100	132120	132073	132073	She	2894	' You mean that we are to go through the lakes together as we have been to - day ? '
132121	132130	132131	132131	Rhoda	197	' No . I do n't mean that . '
132216	132243	132212	132212	she	2894	' Do you remember my saying in the letter how I hungered to taste your lips ? I do n't know how I have refrained so long '
132244	132251	132253	132253	Rhoda	197	' What is your love worth ? '
132283	132289	132290	132290	he	242	' Worth your whole life ! '
132300	132312	132212	132212	she	2894	' That is what I doubt . Convince me of that . '
132313	132328	132212	132212	she	2894	' Convince you ? With more kisses ? But what is your love worth ? '
132329	132344	132212	132212	she	2894	' Perhaps more than you yet understand . Perhaps more than you can understand . '
132345	132380	132212	132212	she	2894	' I will believe that , Rhoda . I know , at all events , that it is something of inestimable price . The knowledge has grown in me for a year and more . '
132381	132408	132212	132212	she	2894	' Let me stand away from you again . There is something more to be said before No , let me be quite apart from you . '
132417	132428	132429	132429	Her	2894	' Will you answer me a question with perfect truthfulness ? '
132447	132457	132437	132437	she	2894	' Yes . I will answer you any question . '
132458	132487	132429	132429	Her	2894	' That is spoken like a man . Tell me then is there at this moment any woman living who has a claim upon you a moral claim ? '
132488	132494	132437	132437	she	2894	' No such woman exists . '
132495	132504	132429	132429	Her	2894	' But do we speak the same language ? '
132505	132508	132509	132509	he	242	' Surely , '
132515	132531	132509	132509	he	242	' There is no woman to whom I am bound by any kind of obligation . '
132550	132583	132429	132429	Her	2894	' I must put the question in another way . During the past month the past three months have you made profession of love have you even pretended love to any woman ? '
132584	132590	132591	132591	he	242	' To no woman whatever , '
132595	132600	132429	132429	Her	2894	' That satisfies me . '
132601	132611	132613	132613	Everard	242	' If I knew what is in your mind ! '
132617	132637	132613	132613	Everard	242	' What sort of life have you imagined for me ? Is this the result of Mary 's talk ? '
132638	132642	132429	132429	Her	2894	' Not immediately . '
132643	132792	132613	132613	Everard	242	' Still , she planted the suspicion . Believe me , you have been altogether mistaken . I never was the kind of man Mary thought me . Some day you shall understand more about it in the meantime my word must be enough . I have no thought of love for any woman but you . Did I frighten you with those joking confessions in my letters ? I wrote them purposely as you must have seen . The mean , paltry jealousies of women such as one meets every day are so hateful to me . They argue such a lack of brains . If I were so unfortunate as to love a woman who looked sour when I praised a beautiful face . I would snap the bond between us like a bit of thread . But you are not one of those poor creatures . '
132801	132832	132793	132793	He	2895	' Should you think me a poor creature if I resented any kind of unfaithfulness ? whether love , in any noble sense , had part in it or not ? '
132833	132867	132613	132613	Everard	242	' No . That is the reasonable understanding between man and wife . If I exact fidelity from you , and certainly I should , I must consider myself under the same obligation . '
132868	132886	132793	132793	He	2895	' You say " man or wife . " Do you say it with the ordinary meaning ? '
132887	132928	132613	132613	Everard	242	' Not as it applies to us . You know what I mean when I ask you to be my wife . If we can not trust each other without legal bonds , any union between us would be unjustified . '
132967	132979	132981	132981	Barfoot	242	' After all , you doubt of your love for me ? '
133282	133315	133277	133277	She	2898	' Are you willing , for the sake of this idea , to abandon all society but that of the very few people who would approve or tolerate what you have done ? '
133316	133380	133277	133277	She	2898	' I look upon the thing in this way . We are not called upon to declare our principles wherever we go . If we regard each other as married , why , we are married . I am no Quixote , hoping to convert the world . It is between you and me our own sense of what is reasonable and dignified . '
133381	133392	133442	133442	Rhoda	197	' But you would not make it a mere deception ? '
133393	133408	133277	133277	She	2898	' Mary would of course be told , and any one else you like . '
133492	133501	133502	133502	she	2898	' I ca n't answer you at once , '
133509	133518	133502	133502	she	2898	' You must . Here and at once . '
133586	133589	133591	133591	Rhoda	197	' No , '
133594	133609	133591	133591	Rhoda	197	' I ca n't answer you tonight . I ca n't decide so suddenly . '
133637	133727	133739	133739	He	2910	' foreseen this moment , and had made preparations for the possibility of never returning to Miss Barfoot 's house knowing the nature of the proposal that would be offered to her . But the practical resolve needed a greater effort than she had imagined . Above all , she feared an ignominious failure of purpose after her word was given ; that would belittle her in Everard 's eyes , and so shame her in her own that all hope of happiness in marriage must be at an end .
133728	133738	133739	133739	He	2910	' You are still doubtful of me , Rhoda ? '
133756	133766	133739	133739	He	2910	' Or are you doubtful of your own love ? '
133767	133781	133739	133739	He	2910	' No . If I understand what love means , I love you . '
133782	133800	133739	133739	He	2910	' Then give me the kiss I am waiting for . You have not kissed me yet . '
133801	133814	133739	133739	He	2910	' I ca n't until I am sure of myself of my readiness '
133835	133841	133842	133842	he	242	' Give me your hand , '
133845	133850	133842	133842	he	242	' The left hand . '
133885	133922	133870	133870	Rhoda	197	' No that proves to me I ca n't ! What should we gain ? You see , you dare not be quite consistent . It 's only deceiving the people who do n't know us . '
133923	133940	133870	133870	Rhoda	197	' But I have explained to you . The consistency is in ourselves , our own minds '
133941	133973	133870	133870	Rhoda	197	' Take it back . Custom is too strong for us . We should only play at defying it . Take it back or I shall drop it on the sand . '
134012	134016	134006	134006	He	242	' Everard , dearest '
134058	134064	134046	134046	he	242	' Will you kiss me ? '
134094	134104	134083	134083	He	242	' You wish for that old , idle form ? '
134105	134121	134083	134083	He	242	' Not the religious form , which has no meaning for either of us , But '
134122	134156	134083	134083	He	242	' You have been living here seven or eight days . Stay till the fifteenth , then we can get a licence from the registrar of the district . Does that please you ? '
134162	134173	134083	134083	He	242	' Do you love me any the less , Everard ? '
134174	134178	134083	134083	He	242	' Kiss me . '
134200	134206	134207	134207	Rhoda	197	' Is n't it better ? '
134218	134231	134207	134207	Rhoda	197	' Wo n't it make our life so much simpler and happier ? '
134232	134235	134179	134179	She	197	' Perhaps . '
134236	134242	134243	134243	She	197	' You know it will . '
134253	134259	134179	134179	She	197	' Perhaps you are right . '
134260	134277	134179	134179	She	197	' I shall let no one hear of it until . Then let us go abroad . '
134278	134285	134179	134179	She	197	' You dare not face Mary ? '
134286	134310	134179	134179	She	197	' I dare , if you wish it . Of course she will laugh at me . They will all laugh at me . '
134311	134320	134179	134179	She	197	' Why , you may laugh as well . '
134321	134358	134179	134179	She	197	' But you have spoilt my life , you know . Such a grand life it might have been . Why did you come and interfere with me ? And you have been so terribly obstinate . '
134359	134376	134179	134179	She	197	' Of course ; that 's my nature . But after all I have been weak . '
134377	134404	134179	134179	She	197	' Yielding in one point that did n't matter to you at all ? It was the only way of making sure that you loved me . '
134409	134423	134405	134405	Barfoot	225	' And what if I needed the other proof that you loved me . '
135487	135490	135486	135489	the ' odd women	4883	' odd women '
135689	135698	135699	135699	she	197	' Shall you stay here all the week ? '

135710	135717	135659	135659	Rhoda	197	' You will find it wearisome . '
135718	135755	135659	135659	Rhoda	197	' Impossible , with you here . But if I run up to London for a day or two it might be better . There are preparations . We shall go first of all to my rooms '
135756	135766	135659	135659	Rhoda	197	' I would rather not have stayed in London . '
135767	135777	135659	135659	Rhoda	197	' I thought you might wish to make purchases . '
135778	135797	135659	135659	Rhoda	197	' Let us go to some other town , and spend a few days there before leaving England . '
135798	135806	135659	135659	Rhoda	197	' Very well . Manchester or Birmingham . '
135807	135813	135815	135815	Rhoda	197	' You speak rather impatiently , '
135825	135833	135815	135815	Rhoda	197	' Let it be London if you prefer '
135834	135885	135659	135659	Rhoda	197	' On no account . It 's all indifferent to me so long as we get safely away together . Every man is impatient of these preliminaries . Yes , in that case I must of course go up to London . To - morrow , and back on Saturday ? '
136044	136078	136033	136033	He	242	' I send you something that has come by post this afternoon . Please to bring it with you when you meet me at eight o'clock if you still care to do so . '
136093	136101	136086	136087	contemptible woman	2956	' If you still care to do so '
136127	136487	136079	136079	His	242	' My DEAR RHODA , I have just gone through a very painful scene , and I feel bound to let you know of it without delay , as it may concern you . This evening Monday , when I came home from Great Portland Street , Emma told me that Mr. Widdowson had called , that he wished to see me as soon as possible , and would be here again at six o'clock . He came , and his appearance alarmed me , he was looking so dreadfully ill . Without preface , he said , " My wife has left me ; she has gone to her sister , and refuses to return . " This was astonishing in itself , and I wondered still more why he should come and tell me about it in so strange a way . The explanation followed very promptly , and you may judge how I heard it . Mr. Widdowson said that his wife had been behaving very badly of late ; that he had discovered several falsehoods she had told him as to her employment during absences from home , in daytime and evening . Having cause for suspecting the worst , he last Saturday engaged a private detective to follow Mrs. Widdowson wherever she went . This man saw her go to the flats in Bayswater where Everard lives and knock at his door . As no one replied , she went away for a time and returned , but again found no one at home . This being at once reported to Mr. Widdowson he asked his wife where she had been that afternoon . The answer was false ; she said she had been here , with me . Thereupon he lost command of himself , and charged her with infidelity . She refused to offer any kind of explanation , but denied that she was guilty and at once left the house . Since , she has utterly refused to see him . Her sister can only report that Monica is very ill , and that she charges her husband with accusing her falsely .
136488	136696	136764	136765	MARY BARFOOT	225	' He had come to me , he said , in unspeakable anguish and helplessness , to ask me whether I had seen anything suspicious in the relations between Monica and my cousin when they met at this house or elsewhere . A nice question ! Of course I could only reply that it had never even occurred to me to observe them that to my knowledge they had met so rarely and that I should never have dreamt of suspecting Monica . " Yet you see she must be guilty , " he kept on repeating . I said no , that I thought her visit might have an innocent significance , though I could n't suggest why she had told falsehoods . Then he inquired what I knew about Everard 's present movements . I answered that I had every reason to think that he was out of town , but did n't know when he went , or when he might be expected to return . The poor man was grievously dissatisfied ; he looked at me as if I were in a base plot against him . It was an immense relief when he went away , after begging me to respect his confidence .
136697	136763	136079	136079	His	242	' I write very hurriedly , as you see . That I ought to write is , I think , clear though I may be doing lamentable mischief . I can not credit this charge against Mrs. Widdowson ; there must surely be some explanation . If you have already left Seascale , no doubt this letter will be forwarded . Ever yours , dear Rhoda ,

136979	136983	136984	136984	he	242	' By Jove ! '

137424	137429	137421	137421	he	242	' Well , Rhoda ? '
137473	137476	137477	137477	he	242	' Well , '
137480	137489	137477	137477	he	242	' what have you to say to me ? '
137490	137495	137444	137444	She	197	' I ? Nothing . '
137496	137524	137477	137477	he	242	' You mean that it is my business to explain what Mary has told you . I ca n't , so there 's an end of it . '
137525	137533	137534	137534	she	197	' What do you mean by that ? '
137542	137577	137477	137477	he	242	' Precisely what I say , Rhoda . And I am obliged to ask what you mean by this odd way of speaking to me . What has happened since we parted this morning ? '
137591	137603	137477	137477	he	242	' If you ca n't explain this letter , who can ? '
137604	137643	137578	137578	Rhoda	197	' I suppose Mrs. Widdowson would be able to account for her doings . I certainly am not able to . And it seems to me that you are strangely forgetful of something that passed between us yesterday . '
137644	137648	137649	137649	she	197	' Of what ? '
137667	137697	137698	137698	He	242	' Evidently you accuse me of concealing something from you . Please to remember a certain plain question you asked me , and the equally plain answer I gave . '
137710	137714	137715	137715	she	197	' I remember , '
137718	137747	137698	137698	He	242	' And you can still behave to me with indignation ? Surely the indignation should be on my side . You are telling me that I deceived you . '
137758	137766	137767	137767	she	197	' How can I help thinking so ? '
137776	137791	137767	137767	she	197	' What can this letter mean ? Why should she go to your rooms ? '
137792	137801	137802	137802	He	242	' I simply do n't know , Rhoda . '
137819	137827	137802	137802	He	242	' She has never been there before ? '
137828	137834	137802	137802	He	242	' Never to my knowledge . '
137889	137898	138214	138214	Rhoda	197	' When did you last see Mrs. Widdowson ? '
137899	137912	137914	137914	Everard	242	' No , I sha n't consent to be cross - examined , '
137921	137955	137914	137914	Everard	242	' As soon as you refuse to accept my word it 's folly to ask further questions . You do n't believe me . Say it honestly and let us understand each other . '
137956	137975	138214	138214	Rhoda	197	' I have good reason for thinking that you could explain Mrs. Widdowson 's behaviour if you chose . '
137976	138085	137914	137914	Everard	242	' Exactly . There 's no misunderstanding that . And if I get angry I am an unpardonable brute . Come now , you ca n't be offended if I treat you as simply my equal , Rhoda . Let me test your sincerity . Suppose I had seen you talking somewhere with some man who seemed to interest you very much , and then to - day , let us say I heard that he had called upon you when you were alone . I turn with a savage face and accuse you of grossly deceiving me in the worst sense . What would your answer be ? '
138086	138092	138093	138093	she	2970	' These are idle suppositions , '
138097	138157	137914	137914	Everard	242	' But the case is possible , you must admit . I want you to realize what I am feeling . In such a case as that , you could only turn from me with contempt . How else can I behave to you conscious of my innocence , yet in the nature of things unable to prove it ? '
138158	138166	137914	137914	Everard	242	' Appearances are very strongly against you . '
138167	138213	137914	137914	Everard	242	' That 's an accident to me quite unaccountable . If I charged you with dishonour you would only have your word to offer in reply . So it is with me . And my word is bluntly rejected . You try me rather severely . '
138218	138357	137914	137914	Everard	242	' I know what you are thinking . My character was previously none of the best . There is a prejudice against me in such a matter for your good . My record is not immaculate ; nor , I believe , is any as this . Well , you shall hear some more plain speech , altogether man 's . I have gone here and there , and have had my adventures like other men . One of them you have heard about the story of that girl Amy Drake the subject of Mrs. Goodall 's righteous wrath . You shall know the truth , and if it offends your ears I ca n't help it . The girl simply threw herself into my arms , on a railway journey , when we met by pure chance . '
138358	138367	138369	138369	Rhoda	197	' I do n't care to hear that , '
138374	138418	137914	137914	Everard	242	' But you shall hear it . That story has predisposed you to believe the worst things of me . If I hold you by force , you shall hear every word of it . Mary seems to have given you mere dark hints '
138419	138434	137914	137914	Everard	242	' No ; she has told me the details . I know it all . '
138435	138662	137914	137914	Everard	242	' From their point of view . Very well ; that saves me a lot of narrative . What those good people did n't understand was the girl 's character . They thought her a helpless innocent ; she was a I 'll spare you the word . She simply planned to get me into her power thought I should be forced to marry her . It 's the kind of thing that happens far oftener than you would suppose ; that 's the reason why men so often smile in what you would call a brutal way when certain stories are told to other men 's discredit . You will have to take this into account , Rhoda , before you reach satisfactory results on the questions that have occupied you so much . I was not in the least responsible for Amy Drake 's desertion of creditable paths . At the worst I behaved foolishly ; and knowing I had done so , knowing how thankless it was to try and clear myself at her expense , I let people say what they would ; it did n't matter . And you do n't believe me ; I can see you do n't . Sexual pride wo n't let you believe me . In such a case the man must necessarily be the villain . '
138663	138681	137914	137914	Everard	242	' What you mean by saying you only behaved " foolishly , " I ca n't understand . '
138682	138872	137914	137914	Everard	242	' Perhaps not , and I ca n't explain as I once did in telling the story to a man , a friend of mine . But however strict your moral ideas , you will admit that a girl of thoroughly bad character is n't a subject for the outcry that was raised about Miss Amy Drake . By taking a little trouble I could have brought things to light which would have given worthy Mrs. Goodall and cousin Mary a great shock . Well , that 's enough . I have never pretended to sanctity ; but , on the other hand , I have never behaved like a scoundrel . You charge me , deliberately , with being a scoundrel , and I defend myself as best I can . You argue that the man who would mislead an innocent girl and then cast her off is more likely than not to be guilty in a case like this of Mrs. Widdowson , when appearances are decidedly against him . There is only my word in each instance . The question is Will you accept my word ? '
138911	138922	138923	138923	he	225	' Let us go up on to the higher sand , '
138979	138994	138952	138952	they	2974	' After all this , what have you to say to me , Rhoda ? '
138995	139007	139008	139008	she	2977	' Will you please to give me your cousin 's letter ? '
139012	139051	139008	139008	she	2977	' Here it is . Now you will go back to your lodgings , and sit with that letter open before you half through the night . You will make yourself unutterably wretched , and all for what ? '
139122	139135	139142	139142	her	2977	' You must prove to me that you have been wrongly suspected . '
139182	139190	139191	139191	he	2978	' How am I to prove it ? '
139195	139228	139156	139156	She	2977	' If there was nothing wrong between you and Mrs. Widdowson , there must be some very simple explanation of her coming to your rooms and being so anxious to see you . '
139229	139240	139191	139191	he	2978	' And is it my business to discover that explanation ? '
139241	139247	139156	139156	She	2977	' Can it be mine ? '
139248	139272	139191	139191	he	2978	' It must either be yours , Rhoda , or no one 's . I shall take no single step in the matter . '
139290	139300	139301	139301	Everard	242	' You are putting yourself wildly in the wrong , '
139304	139328	139301	139301	Everard	242	' By refusing to take my word you make it impossible for me to hope that we could live together as we imagined . '
139586	139596	139597	139597	she	2980	' I do n't refuse to take your word , '
139604	139636	139597	139597	she	2980	' I only say that your name must be cleared from suspicion . Mr. Widdowson is sure to tell his story to other people . Why has his wife left him ? '
139637	139644	139680	139680	him	2983	' I neither know nor care . '
139645	139660	139597	139597	she	2980	' You must prove to me that you are not the cause of it . '
139661	139673	139680	139680	him	2983	' I shall not make the slightest effort to do so . '
139731	139734	139728	139728	Everard	242	' Rhoda ! '
139741	139767	139735	139735	She	2980	' You remember that I was going to London to - morrow . It seems that I had better go and not trouble to return . '
139768	139776	139728	139728	Everard	242	' That is for you to decide . '
139777	139782	139735	139735	She	2980	' For you rather . '
139783	139793	139728	139728	Everard	242	' I have said all that I can say . '
139794	139812	139735	139735	She	2980	' And so have I. But surely you must be unconscious how grossly you are insulting me . '
139813	139830	139728	139728	Everard	242	' I want only to understand what purpose Mrs. Widdowson had in going to your rooms . '
139831	139850	139735	139735	She	2980	' Then why not ask her ? You are friends . She would doubtless tell you the truth . '
139851	139875	139728	139728	Everard	242	' If she comes to me voluntarily to make an explanation , I will hear it . But I shall not ask her . '
139876	139898	139735	139735	She	2980	' Your view of the fitness of things is that I should request her to wait upon you for that purpose ? '
139899	139909	139728	139728	Everard	242	' There are others who can act for you . '
139910	139941	139735	139735	She	2980	' Very well . Then we are at a deadlock . It seems to me that we had better shake hands like sensible people , and say good - bye . '
139942	139952	139728	139728	Everard	242	' Much better if it seems so to you . '
140010	140039	140004	140004	Everard	242	' When you are ready to say that you have used me very ill , I shall remember only yesterday . Till then good - bye , Rhoda . '
140408	140426	140402	140403	Mr. Widdowson	217	' You may still write to this address ; if I leave , letters shall be forwarded . '
140772	140782	140783	140784	Miss Barfoot	212	' Have you seen Everard since you went away ? '
140808	140817	140818	140818	Rhoda	197	' Yes , I saw him at Seascale , '
140826	140834	140933	140933	Rhoda	197	' Before or after that news came ? '
140835	140862	140933	140933	Rhoda	197	' Both before and after . I showed him your letter , and all he had to say was that he knew nothing of the affair . '
140863	140932	140933	140933	Rhoda	197	' That 's all he has to say to me . I have n't seen him . A letter I sent to his address was answered , after a week , from a place I never heard of Arromanches , in Normandy . The shortest and rudest letter I ever had from him . Practically he told me to mind my own business . And there things stand . '
141062	141066	141067	141067	she	197	' I suppose , '
141071	141081	141067	141067	she	197	' Mr. Widdowson will try to divorce his wife . '
141082	141098	141067	141067	she	197	' I am in dread of that . But they may have made it up . '
141099	141110	141067	141067	she	197	' Of course you have no doubt of her guilt ? '
141179	141185	141187	141188	Miss Barfoot	212	' I have some doubt , '
141192	141210	141187	141188	Miss Barfoot	212	' But I should be glad of some one else 's favourable opinion to help my charity . '
141211	141238	141161	141161	Rhoda	197	' Miss Madden has n't been here , you see . She certainly would have come if she had felt convinced that her sister was wronged . '
141239	141263	141187	141188	Miss Barfoot	212	' Unless a day or two saw the end of the trouble when naturally none of them would say any more about it . '
141731	141740	141741	141741	Rhoda	197	' I have been wanting to ask you , '
141744	141754	141741	141741	Rhoda	197	' whether you have any news of Mrs. Widdowson . '
141755	141787	141905	141905	Mildred	234	' I wrote to her not long ago , and she answered from a new address . She said she had left her husband and would never go back to him . '
141792	141807	141905	141905	Mildred	234	' Then what I had heard was true . You have n't seen her ? '
141808	141823	141741	141741	Rhoda	197	' She asked me not to come . She is living with her sister . '
141824	141838	141905	141905	Mildred	234	' Did she give you any reason for the separation from her husband ? '
141839	141842	141844	141844	Mildred	234	' None , '
141846	141882	141844	141844	Mildred	234	' But she said it was no secret ; that every one knew . That 's why I have n't spoken to you about it as I should have done otherwise after our last conversation . '
141883	141890	141892	141892	Rhoda	197	' The fact is no secret , '
141895	141904	141892	141892	Rhoda	197	' But why will she offer no explanation ? '
142566	142576	142578	142579	Mrs. Cosgrove	277	' In mercy , come and talk to me ! '
142581	142603	142578	142579	Mrs. Cosgrove	277	' I am quite alone , and feel as if I could hang myself . Are you obliged to go anywhere ? '
142604	142613	142687	142688	Mrs. Cosgrove	277	' No . I was having a walk . '
142614	142673	142578	142579	Mrs. Cosgrove	277	' A walk ? What astonishing energy ! It never occurs to me to take a walk in London . I came from the country last night and expected to find my sister here , but she wo n't arrive till Tuesday . I have been standing at the window for an hour , getting crazy with ennui . '
142761	142771	142773	142774	the listener	632	' It does n't in the least surprise me , '
142779	142810	142773	142774	the listener	632	' I saw they would n't be able to live together very well . Without children the thing was impossible . Of course she has told you all about it ? '
142811	142821	142747	142747	She	265	' I have n't seen her since it happened . '
142822	142903	142773	142774	the listener	632	' Do you know , I always have a distinct feeling of pleasure when I hear of married people parting . How horrible that would seem to some of our good friends ! But it is n't a malicious pleasure ; there 's nothing personal in it . As I have told you before , I think , I led a very contented life with my husband . But marriage in general is such a humbug you forgive the word . '
142904	142910	142912	142912	Rhoda	197	' Of course it is , '
142919	143096	142773	142774	the listener	632	' I am glad of anything that seems to threaten it as an institution in its present form . A scandalous divorce case is a delight to me anything that makes it evident how much misery would be spared if we could civilize ourselves in this respect . There are women whose conduct I think personally detestable , and whom yet I ca n't help thanking for their assault upon social laws . We shall have to go through a stage of anarchy , you know , before reconstruction begins . Yes , in that sense I am an anarchist . Seriously , I believe if a few men and women in prominent position would contract marriage of the free kind , without priest or lawyer , open and defiantly , they would do more benefit to their kind than in any other possible way . I do n't declare this opinion to every one , but only because I am a coward . Whatever one believes with heart and soul one ought to make known . '
143105	143114	143115	143115	she	197	' It needs a great deal of courage , '
143118	143127	143115	143115	she	197	' To take that step , I mean . '
143128	143205	142773	142774	the listener	632	' Of course . We need martyrs . And yet I doubt whether the martyrdom would be very long , or very trying , to intellectual people . A woman of brains who boldly acted upon her conviction would have no lack of congenial society . The best people are getting more liberal than they care to confess to each other . Wait until some one puts the matter to the test and you will see . '
143236	143243	143244	143245	the revolutionist	3033	' Where is Mrs. Widdowson living ? '
143250	143264	143244	143245	the revolutionist	3033	' I do n't know . But I can get you her address . '
143265	143289	143321	143321	She	235	' Pray do . I shall go and see her . We are quite friendly enough for me to do so without impertinence . '
143369	143480	143356	143357	Mrs. Cosgrove	277	' She is ill , wretched , and unwilling to talk . I could only stay about a quarter of an hour , and to ask questions was impossible . She mentioned your name , and appeared very anxious to hear about you ; but when I asked whether she would like you to call she grew timid all at once , and said she hoped you would n't unless you really desired to see her . Poor thing ! Of course I do n't know what it all means , but I came away with maledictions on marriage in my heart one is always safe in indulging that feeling . '
143771	143854	143761	143761	Mary	225	' DEAR COUSIN MARY , After all I was rather too grumpy In my last note to you . But my patience had been desperately tried . I have gone through a good deal ; now at last I am recovering sanity , and can admit that you had no choice but to ask those questions . I know and care nothing about Mrs. Widdowson . By her eccentric behaviour she either did me a great injury or a great service , I 'm
143882	144002	143757	143757	Everard	242	' Do you know anything about Arromanches ? A very quiet little spot on the Normandy coast . You get to it by an hour 's coach from Bayeux . Not infested by English . I went there on an invitation from the Brissendens ; who discovered the place last year . Excellent people these . I like them better the more I know of them . A great deal of quiet liberality even extreme liberality in the two girls . They would suit you , I am sure . Well instructed . Agnes , the younger , reads half a dozen languages , and shames me by her knowledge of all sorts of things . And yet delightfully feminine .
144003	144028	144246	144246	Everard	242	' As they were going to Ostend I thought I might as well follow them , and we continue to see each other pretty frequently .
144029	144118	143757	143757	Everard	242	' By - the - bye , I shall have to find new quarters if I come back to London . The engineer , back from Italy after a longer absence than he anticipated , wants his flat , and of course must have it . But then I may not come back at all , except to gather my traps . I shall not call on you , unless I have heard that you do n't doubt the assurance I have now twice given . Your profligate relative ,
144121	144121	143757	143757	Everard	242	'
144122	144126	144128	144128	Mary	213	' I think , '
144130	144245	144128	144128	Mary	213	' that we may safely believe him . Such a lie would be too bad ; he is incapable of it . Remember , I have never charged him with falsehood . I shall write and tell him that I accept his word . Has it , or has it not , occurred to you to see Mrs. Widdowson herself ? Or , if there are insuperable objections , why not see Miss Madden ? We talk to each other in a sort of cypher , dear Rhoda . Well , I desire nothing but your good , as I think you know , and you must decide for yourself where that good lies . '
144754	144766	144742	144742	She	197	' Why have you not been to see me before this ? '
144767	144791	144742	144742	She	197	' I really could n't . The circumstances everything is so very painful . You know of course you know what has happened ? '
144792	144798	144742	144742	She	197	' Of course I do . '
144799	144802	144804	144804	Virginia	191	' How , '
144807	144817	144804	144804	Virginia	191	' did the news first of all reach you ? '
144818	144829	144742	144742	She	197	' Mr. Widdowson came here and told Miss Barfoot everything . '
144830	144849	144804	144804	Virginia	191	' He came ? We did n't know that . Then you have heard the accusation he makes ? '
144850	144853	144742	144742	She	197	' Everything . '
144854	144884	144804	144804	Virginia	191	' It is quite unfounded , I do assure you . Monica is not guilty . The poor child has done nothing it was an indiscretion nothing more than indiscretion '
144885	144947	144742	144742	She	197	' I am very anxious to believe it . Can you give me certainty ? Can you explain Monica 's behaviour not only on that one occasion , but the deceit she practised at other times ? Her husband told Miss Barfoot that she had frequently told him untruths such as saying that she called here when she certainly did not . '
144948	144955	144957	144957	Virginia	191	' I ca n't explain that , '
144959	144971	144957	144957	Virginia	191	' Monica wo n't tell me why she concealed her movements . '
144972	144989	144742	144742	She	197	' Then how can you ask me to believe your assurance that she is n't guilty ? '
145016	145034	144742	144742	She	197	' Oh , Miss Nunn ! How can you think Monica ? You know her better ; I 'm
145039	145039	144742	144742	She	197	'
145040	145049	145051	145053	the other impatiently	1268	' Any human being may commit a crime , '
145067	145083	145051	145053	the other impatiently	1268	' Who knows any one well enough to say that a charge must be unfounded ? '
145090	145092	144742	144742	She	197	' I 'm
145104	145104	144742	144742	She	197	'
145105	145126	144742	144742	She	197	' I did n't want to distress you . Do command yourself , and let us talk about it calmly . '
145127	145327	144742	144742	She	197	' Yes I will I shall be so glad to talk about it with you . Oh , if I could persuade her to return to her husband ! He is willing to receive her . I meet him very often on Clapham Common , and We are living at his expense . When Monica had been with me in my old lodgings for about a week he took these new rooms for us , and Monica consented to remove . But she wo n't hear of going back to live with him . He has offered to let us have the house to ourselves , but it 's no use . He writes to her , but she wo n't reply . Do you know that he has taken a house at Clevedon a beautiful house ? They were to go to it in a week or two , and Alice and I would have gone to share it with them then this dreadful thing happened . And Mr. Widdowson does n't even insist on her telling him what she keeps secret . He is willing to take her back under any circumstances . And she is so ill '
145358	145366	145368	145368	Rhoda	197	' Seriously ill , do you mean ? '
145376	145385	145373	145373	her	197	' She gets up each day , but I 'm
145394	145394	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	'
145404	145421	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' What can have caused this ? Is it the result of her being falsely accused ? '
145422	145427	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' Partly that . But '
145454	145462	145429	145429	Virginia	191	' And still you believe her innocent ? '
145463	145517	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' She has sworn to me that she is innocent . She says that she has a proof of it which I shall see some day and her husband also . A presentiment has fixed itself in her mind that she ca n't live , and before the end she will tell everything . '
145518	145534	145429	145429	Virginia	191	' Her husband knows of this , of course of what you have told me ? '
145535	145665	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' No . She has forbidden me to say anything and how could I , Miss Nunn ? She has made me promise solemnly that he shall not be told . I have n't even told Alice . But she will know very soon . At the end of September she leaves her place , and will come to London to be with us for a time at all events . We do so hope that we shall succeed in persuading Monica to go to the house at Clevedon . Mr. Widdowson is keeping it , and will move the furniture from Herne Hill at any moment . Could n't you help us , dear Miss Nunn ? Monica would listen to you ; I am sure she would . '
145666	145668	145429	145429	Virginia	191	' I 'm
145677	145681	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' Rhoda answered coldly .
145682	145691	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' She has been hoping to see you . '
145692	145698	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' She has said so ? '
145699	145741	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' Not in so many words but I am sure she wishes to see you . She has asked about you several times , and when your note came she was very pleased . It would be a great kindness to us '
145742	145755	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' Does she declare that she will never return to her husband ? '
145756	145850	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' Yes I am sorry to say she does . But the poor child believes that she has only a short time to live . Nothing will shake her presentiment . " I shall die , and give no more trouble " that 's what she always says to me . And a conviction of that kind is so likely to fulfil itself . She never leaves the house , and of course that is very wrong ; she ought to go out every day . She wo n't see a medical man . '
145851	145863	145864	145864	Rhoda	197	' Has Mr. Widdowson given her any cause for disliking him ? '
145867	145876	145395	145395	Rhoda	197	' He was dreadfully violent when he discovered I 'm
145942	145966	145941	145941	I	0	'm afraid so ill - matched in almost every respect . Still , under the circumstances surely she ought to return to him ? '
145967	145978	145941	145941	I	0	' I ca n't say . I do n't know . '
146123	146130	146132	146132	Virginia	191	' I must n't stay longer , '
146140	146178	146132	146132	Virginia	191	' I am always afraid to be away from her even for an hour ; the fear of dreadful things that might happen haunts me day and night . How glad I shall be when Alice comes ! '
147137	147225	147114	147114	she	311	' When your letter came , could I very well have acted otherwise than I did ? It was not a flat refusal to believe him ; all I asked was that things should be cleared up before our marriage . For his own sake he ought to have willingly agreed to that . He preferred to take my request as an insult . His unreasonable anger made me angry too . And now I do n't think we shall ever meet again unless as mere acquaintances . '
147226	147230	147232	147233	the listener	632	' I think , '
147235	147243	147232	147233	the listener	632	' that he behaved with extraordinary impudence . '
147244	147261	147114	147114	she	311	' In the first proposal ? But I myself attach no importance to the marriage ceremony . '
147262	147271	147273	147273	Mary	213	' Then why did you insist upon it ? '
147291	147298	147114	147114	she	311	' Would you have received us ? '
147299	147311	147312	147312	Rhoda	197	' In the one case as readily as in the other . '
147319	147329	147312	147312	Rhoda	197	' Perhaps I never felt entire confidence in him . '
147342	147444	147114	147114	she	311	' My own dearest love , if I could but describe to you all I have suffered before sitting down to write this letter ! Since our last meeting I have not known one hour of quietness . To think that I missed you when you called and left that note for it was you yourself , was it not ? The journey was horrible , and the week that I have spent here I assure you I have not slept for more than a few minutes at a time , and I am utterly broken down by misery . My darling '
147447	147533	147114	147114	she	311	' I regard myself as a criminal ; if you have suffered a thousandth part of what I have , I deserve any punishment that could be devised . For it has all been my fault . Knowing as I did that our love could never end in happiness , it was my duty to hide what I felt . I ought never to have contrived that first meeting alone for it was contrived ; I sent my sisters away on purpose . I ought never '
147536	147601	147114	147114	she	311	' The only reflection that can ever bring me comfort is that our love has been pure . We can always think of each other without shame . And why should this love ever have an end ? We are separated , and perhaps shall never see each other again , but may not our hearts remain for ever true ? May we not think '
147604	147691	147114	147114	she	311	' If I were to bid you leave your home and come to me , I should be once more acting with base selfishness . I should ruin your life , and load my own with endless self - reproach . I find that even mere outward circumstances would not allow of what for a moment we dreamt might be possible , and of that I am glad , since it helps me to overcome the terrible temptation . Oh , if you knew how that temptation '
147694	147723	147114	147114	she	311	' Time will be a friend to both of us , dearest Monica . Forget each other we never can , we never will . But our unsullied love '
147745	147748	147114	147114	she	311	' Mrs. Williamson '
148184	148190	148168	148168	She	195	' What have you heard ? '
148191	148201	148159	148160	the landlady	447	' He went there . He told them everything . '
148202	148214	148168	148168	She	195	' How did Miss Nunn look ? How did she speak ? '
148215	148225	148227	148227	Virginia	191	' Oh , she was very , very distant , '
148229	148272	148227	148227	Virginia	191	' I do n't quite know why she sent for me . She said there would be no use in her coming to see you and I do n't think she ever will . I told her that there was no truth in '
148273	148280	148282	148282	Monica	195	' But how did she look ? '
148285	148314	148168	148168	She	195	' Not at all well , I thought . She had been away for her holiday , but it does n't seem to have done her much good . '
148315	148324	148168	148168	She	195	' He went there and told them everything ? '
148325	148362	148168	148168	She	195	' Yes just after it happened . But he has n't seen them since that . I could see they believed him . It was no use all that I said . She looked so stern and '
148363	148372	148168	148168	She	195	' Did you ask anything about Mr. Barfoot ? '
148373	148421	148168	148168	She	195	' My dear , I did n't venture to . It was impossible . But I feel quite sure that they must have broken off all intercourse with him . Whatever he may have said , they evidently did n't believe it . Miss Barfoot is away now .
148422	148432	148168	148168	She	195	' And what did you tell her about me ? '
148433	148443	148168	148168	She	195	' Everything that you said I might , dear . '
148444	148451	148168	148168	She	195	' Nothing else you are sure ? '
148466	148476	148478	148478	Monica	195	' It would n't have mattered if you had , '
148481	148487	148478	148478	Monica	195	' I do n't care . '
148504	148517	148168	148168	She	195	' Then why were you so particular to forbid me , Monica ? '
148518	148543	148168	148168	She	195	' It was better but I do n't care . I do n't care for anything . Let them believe and say what they like '
148544	148558	148168	148168	She	195	' Monica , if I find out at last that you have deceived me '
148559	148570	148572	148574	the other wretchedly	3116	' Oh , do , do , do be quiet ! '
148576	148592	148572	148574	the other wretchedly	3116	' I shall go somewhere and live alone or die alone . You worry me I 'm

148598	148607	148168	148168	She	195	' You are not very grateful , Monica . '
148608	148649	148572	148574	the other wretchedly	3116	' I ca n't be grateful ! You must expect nothing from me . If you keep talking and questioning I shall go away . I do n't care what becomes of me . The sooner I die the better . '
149012	149024	149003	149003	Monica	195	' Come with me . We 'll go into the town . '
149025	149039	149041	149041	Virginia	191	' But you refused to go out this morning when it was fine , '
149043	149053	149041	149041	Virginia	191	' And now you can see it will rain . '
149054	149061	149003	149003	Monica	195	' Then I shall go alone . '
149069	149075	149003	149003	Monica	195	' No , no ; I 'm
149083	149083	149062	149063	The sister	521	'
149084	149112	149003	149003	Monica	195	' Anywhere out of this dead place . We 'll go by train , and walk from Victoria anywhere . To the Abbey , if you like . '

149402	149413	149415	149415	Monica	195	' It 's one of the girls from Walworth Road , '
149417	149430	149415	149415	Monica	195	' Just walk on ; I 'll meet you at the bookstall . '
149431	149442	149389	149389	Virginia	191	' But , my dear , she does n't look respectable '
149443	149454	149415	149415	Monica	195	' Go on ; I wo n't be a minute . '
149470	149477	149389	149389	Virginia	191	' You have left the shop ? '
149478	149505	149455	149455	Monica	195	' Left I should think so . Nearly a year ago . I told you I should n't stand it much longer . Are you married ? '
149506	149509	149389	149389	Virginia	191	' Yes . '
149523	149527	149529	149530	Miss Eade	216	' You are ? '
149532	149541	149529	149530	Miss Eade	216	' Nobody that I know , I suppose ? '

149719	149740	149708	149709	the speaker	884	' I have neither seen nor heard of him since I left Walworth Road . Is n't he still there ? '
149741	149762	149824	149824	her	216	' Not he . He went about the same time you did , and nobody knew where he hid himself . '
149763	149771	149708	149709	the speaker	884	' Hid ? Why should he hide ? '
149772	149793	149824	149824	her	216	' I only mean he got out of sight somewheres . I thought perhaps you might have come across him . '
149794	149816	149708	149709	the speaker	884	' No , I have n't . Now I must say good - bye . That lady is waiting for me . '

149954	149961	149938	149939	The girl	384	' Is it a name as you 're

Let me again entreat you to go to Clevedon . The furniture shall be moved any moment you wish . I solemnly promise not to molest you in any way , not even by writing . It shall be understood that business makes it necessary for me to live in London . For your sister 's sake do accept this offer . If I could see you in private , I should be able to give you a very good reason why your sister Virginia would benefit by the change ; perhaps you yourself know of it . Do answer me , Monica . Never again will I refer by word or look to what has passed . I am anxious only to put an end to the wretched life that you are leading . Do go to the house at Clevedon , I implore you . '

152988	153001	152980	152980	Alice	185	' You must remember what her life has been , dear . I 'm
153009	153009	152980	152980	Alice	185	'
153010	153064	153065	153065	She	185	' She need n't have been lonely . She refused to come and live at Herne Hill , and now of course I understand why . Mrs. Conisbee must have known about it , and it was her duty to tell me . Mr. Widdowson had found out somehow , I feel sure . '
153073	153082	153084	153085	Miss Madden	204	' You know what it all points to , '
153094	153121	153084	153085	Miss Madden	204	' You must do as your husband wishes , dearest . We must go to Clevedon . There the poor girl will be out of temptation . '
153122	153129	152980	152980	Alice	185	' You and Virgie may go . '
153130	153145	153084	153085	Miss Madden	204	' You too , Monica . My dear sister , it is your duty . '
153146	153155	153157	153159	the other angrily	3215	' Do n't use that word to me ! '
153161	153194	153157	153159	the other angrily	3215	' It is not my duty . It can be no woman 's duty to live with a man she hates - or even to make a pretence of living with him . '
153195	153199	153084	153085	Miss Madden	204	' But , dearest '
153200	153239	153157	153159	the other angrily	3215	' You must n't begin this to - night , Alice . I have been ill all day , and now my head is aching terribly . Go downstairs and eat the supper they have laid for you . '
153240	153248	153250	153251	Miss Madden	204	' I could n't touch a morsel , '
153253	153266	153250	153251	Miss Madden	204	' Oh , everything is too dreadful ! Life is too hard ! '
153285	153294	153295	153295	she	204	' If you do n't want any supper , '
153301	153318	153295	153295	she	204	' please go and tell them , so that they need n't sit up for you . '
154190	154198	154199	154199	she	924	' We must leave her alone today , '
154204	154231	154199	154199	she	924	' She wo n't take any meal . Oh , the wretched state she is in ! If only I could have known of this before ! '
154232	154242	154199	154199	she	924	' Has it been going on for very long ? '
154243	154313	154199	154199	she	924	' It began soon after she went to live at Mrs. Conisbee 's . She has told me all about it poor girl , poor thing ! Whether she can ever break herself of it , who knows ? She says that she will take the pledge of total abstinence , and I encouraged her to do so ; it may be some use , do n't you think ? '
154314	154320	154199	154199	she	924	' Perhaps I do n't know '
154321	154384	154199	154199	she	924	' But I have no faith in her reforming unless she goes away from London . She thinks herself that only a new life in a new place will give her the strength . My dear , at Mrs. Conisbee 's she starved herself to have money to buy spirits ; she went without any food but dry bread day after day . '
154385	154400	154199	154199	she	924	' Of course that made it worse . She must have craved for support . '
154401	154425	154199	154199	she	924	' Of course . And your husband knows about it . He came once when she was in that state when you were away '
154434	154469	154199	154199	she	924	' Her life has been so dreadfully unhealthy . She seems to have become weak - minded . All her old interests have gone ; she reads nothing but novels , day after day . '
154470	154476	154199	154199	she	924	' I have noticed that . '
154477	154539	154199	154199	she	924	' How can we help her , Monica ? Wo n't you make a sacrifice for the poor girl 's sake ? Can not I persuade you , dear ? Your position has a bad influence on her ; I can see it has . She worries so about you , and then tries to forget the trouble you know how . '
154605	154617	154584	154585	Miss Madden	204	' Monica you are deceiving us all . You are guilty . '
154618	154625	154731	154731	she	185	' Why do you say that ? '
154626	154644	154584	154585	Miss Madden	204	' I know it . I have watched you . You betray yourself when you are thinking . '
154658	154719	154645	154646	The other	462	' All your natural affection is dead , and only guilt could have caused that . You do n't care what becomes of your sister . Only the fear , or the evil pride , that comes of guilt could make you refuse what we ask of you . You are afraid to let your husband know of your condition . '
154752	154758	154760	154761	her sister	455	' That last is true , '
154772	154779	154760	154761	her sister	455	' You confess it ? O Monica '
154780	154789	154792	154793	the younger	5786	' I do n't confess what you think , '
154807	154868	154760	154761	her sister	455	' Of that I am not guilty . I am afraid of his knowing , because he will never believe me . I have a proof which would convince anyone else ; but , even if I produced it , it would be no use . I do n't think it is possible to persuade him - when once he knows '
154869	154879	154760	154761	her sister	455	' If you were innocent you would disregard that . '
154880	154972	154760	154761	her sister	455	' Listen to me , Alice . If I were guilty I should not be living here at his expense . I only consented to do that when I knew what my condition was . But for this thing I should have refused to accept another penny from him . I should have drawn upon my own money until I was able to earn my own living again . If you wo n't believe this it shows you know nothing of me . Your reading of my face is all foolishness . '
154973	154986	154988	154989	Miss Madden	204	' I would to God I were sure of what you say ! '
155004	155014	155016	155016	Monica	195	' You know that I told my husband lies , '
155018	155177	155016	155016	Monica	195	' so you think I am never to be trusted . I did tell him lies ; I ca n't deny it , and I am ashamed of it . But I am not a deceitful woman I can say that boldly . I love the truth better than falsehood . If it were n't for that I should never have left home . A deceitful woman , in my circumstances you do n't understand them would have cheated her husband into forgiving her such a husband as mine . She would have calculated the most profitable course . I left my husband because it was hateful to me to be with a man for whom I had lost every trace of affection . In keeping away from him I am acting honestly . But I have told you that I am also afraid of his making a discovery . I want him to believe when the time comes '
155182	155216	155178	155178	She	3248	' Then , Monica , you ought to make known to him what you have been concealing . If you are telling the truth , that confession ca n't be anything very dreadful . '
155217	155254	155178	155178	She	3248	' Alice , I am willing to make an agreement . If my husband will promise never to come near Clevedon until I send for him I will go and live there with you and Virgie . '
155255	155263	155265	155266	Miss Madden	204	' He has promised that , darling , '
155269	155369	155178	155178	She	3248	' Not to me . He has only said that he will make his home in London for a time : that means he would come whenever he wished , if it were only to speak to you and Virgie . But he must undertake never to come near until I give him permission . If he will promise this , and keep his word , I pledge myself to let him know the whole truth in less than a year . Whether I live or die , he shall be told the truth in less than a year . '
155498	155553	155487	155487	Monica	195	' I am about to leave London , and before I go I very much wish to see you . Will you allow me to call at some hour when I could speak to you in private ? There is something I must make known to you , and I can not write it . '
155624	155631	155632	155632	Monica	195	' It will be lost trouble , '
155635	155667	155632	155632	Monica	195	' More likely than not there is a spy waiting to follow me wherever I go . Your assurance that I really went to Miss Barfoot 's wo n't be needed . '
155682	155708	155632	155632	Monica	195	' Have you undertaken to save him the expense of private detectives ? Have you promised never to let me go out of your sight ? '
155709	155715	155717	155717	Alice	185	' Certainly I have not , '
155719	155725	155727	155727	Virginia	191	' Nor I , dear , '
155729	155739	155727	155727	Virginia	191	' He has never asked anything of the kind . '
155740	155777	155778	155778	She	195	' Then you may be sure that the spies are still watching me . Let them have something to do , poor creatures . I shall go alone , so you need n't say any more . '
156010	156047	155997	155997	Her	195	' , a cold dignity , only not offensive haughtiness , appeared in her bearing . She did not offer to shake hands , and used no form of civility beyond requesting her visitor to be seated .
156048	156054	156055	156055	Monica	195	' I am going away , '
156065	156073	156055	156055	Monica	195	' Yes , so you told me . '
156074	156088	156102	156102	Their	3263	' I can see that you ca n't understand why I have come . '
156089	156101	156055	156055	Monica	195	' Your note only said that you wished to see me . '
156159	156173	156154	156155	Miss Nunn	197	' Is it possible that I can be of any service to you ? '
156174	156192	156154	156155	Miss Nunn	197	' Yes . You might be . But I find it is very difficult to say what I '
156210	156227	156154	156155	Miss Nunn	197	' Will you tell me , Miss Nunn , why you behave so coldly to me ? '
156228	156240	156154	156155	Miss Nunn	197	' Surely that does n't need any explanation , Mrs. Widdowson ? '
156241	156253	156154	156155	Miss Nunn	197	' You mean that you believe everything Mr. Widdowson has said ? '
156254	156282	156154	156155	Miss Nunn	197	' Mr. Widdowson has said nothing to me . But I have seen your sister , and there seemed no reason to doubt what she told me . '
156283	156299	156154	156155	Miss Nunn	197	' She could n't tell you the truth , because she does n't know it . '
156300	156310	156154	156155	Miss Nunn	197	' I presume she at least told no untruth . '
156311	156327	156154	156155	Miss Nunn	197	' What did Virginia say ? I think I have a right to ask that . '
156349	156361	156362	156362	she	197	' Your affairs do n't really concern me , Mrs. Widdowson , '
156367	156411	156362	156362	she	197	' They have been forced upon my attention , and perhaps I regard them from a wrong point of view . Unless you have come to defend yourself against a false accusation , is there any profit in our talking of these things ? '
156412	156419	156336	156336	her	197	' I have come for that . '
156420	156434	156362	156362	she	197	' Then I am not so unjust as to refuse to hear you . '
156435	156458	156336	156336	her	197	' My name has been spoken of together with Mr. Barfoot 's . This is wrong . It began from a mistake . '
156494	156518	156482	156482	she	195	' When I went to Bayswater that day I had no thought of seeing Mr. Barfoot . I wished to see someone else . '
156540	156544	156545	156545	she	195	' Some one , '
156549	156557	156545	156545	she	195	' who was living with Mr. Barfoot ? '
156558	156605	156525	156525	She	195	' No . Some one in the same building ; in another flat . When I knocked at Mr. Barfoot 's door , I knew or I felt sure no one would answer . I knew Mr. Barfoot was going away that day going into Cumberland . '
156617	156626	156627	156627	she	195	' You knew he was going to Cumberland ? '
156636	156654	156525	156525	She	195	' He told me so . I met him , quite by chance , the day before . '
156655	156662	156525	156525	She	195	' Where did you meet him ? '
156663	156668	156669	156669	Monica	195	' Near the flats , '
156674	156708	156669	156669	Monica	195	' He had just come out I saw him come out . I had an appointment there that afternoon , and I walked a short way with him , so that he should n't '
156743	156754	156737	156738	Miss Nunn	197	' I have n't asked for your confidence , remember . '
156755	156806	156737	156738	Miss Nunn	197	' No and if you try to imagine what it means for me to be speaking like this I am not shameless . I have suffered a great deal before I could bring myself to come here and tell you . If you were more human if you tried to believe '
156835	156848	156737	156738	Miss Nunn	197	' Why have you come ? Why do you tell me this ? '
156849	156898	156737	156738	Miss Nunn	197	' Because it is n't only that I have been falsely accused . I felt I must tell you that Mr. Barfoot had never - that there was nothing between us . What has he said ? How did he meet the charge Mr. Widdowson made against him ? '
156899	156905	156737	156738	Miss Nunn	197	' Simply by denying it . '
156906	156916	156737	156738	Miss Nunn	197	' Has n't he wished to appeal to me ? '
156917	156962	156737	156738	Miss Nunn	197	' I do n't know . I have n't heard of his expressing such a wish . I ca n't see that you are called upon to take any trouble about Mr. Barfoot . He ought to be able to protect his own reputation . '
156963	156969	156970	156970	Monica	195	' Has he done so ? '
156974	156982	156970	156970	Monica	195	' Did you believe him when he denied '
156983	156996	156737	156738	Miss Nunn	197	' But what does it matter whether I believed him or not ? '
156997	157007	156970	156970	Monica	195	' He would think it mattered a great deal . '
157008	157017	156737	156738	Miss Nunn	197	' Mr. Barfoot would think so ? Why ? '
157018	157100	156970	156970	Monica	195	' He told me how much he wished to have your good opinion That is what we used to talk about . I do n't know why he took me into his confidence . It happened first of all when we were going by train the same train , by chance after we had both been calling here . He asked me many questions about you , and at last said that he loved you or something that meant the same . '
157107	157111	157113	157113	Monica	195	' After that , '
157115	157166	157113	157113	Monica	195	' we several times spoke of you . We did so when we happened to meet near his rooms as I have told you . He told me he was going to Cumberland with the hope of seeing you ; and I understood him to mean he wished to ask you '
157224	157234	157236	157236	Monica	195	' There was never more than that between us , '
157240	157280	157236	157236	Monica	195	' My interest in Mr. Barfoot was only on your account . I hoped he might be successful . And I have come to you because I feared you would believe my husband as I see you have done . '
157351	157363	157345	157345	her	197	' I am very sorry you have laid this task upon yourself '
157375	157387	157365	157365	Monica	195	' If only I could know that I had done any good '
157388	157391	157393	157393	Rhoda	197	' But , '
157400	157413	157393	157393	Rhoda	197	' you do n't wish me to repeat what you have said ? '
157414	157438	157365	157365	Monica	195	' It was only for you . I thought if you felt able to let Mr. Barfoot know that you had no longer any '
157451	157458	157459	157459	she	195	' You have seen him then ? '
157465	157469	157365	157365	Monica	195	' Not since . '
157470	157477	157549	157549	her	195	' He has written to you ? '
157484	157528	157365	157365	Monica	195	' Indeed he has not . Mr. Barfoot never wrote to me . I know nothing whatever about him . No one asked me to come to you do n't think that . No one knows of what I have been telling you . '
157552	157582	157547	157547	Monica	195	' As I have said so much I must tell you all . It would be dreadful after this to go away uncertain whether you believed me or not . '
157635	157642	157643	157643	Monica	195	' I will tell you everything , '
157652	157671	157643	157643	Monica	195	' If no one else believes me , you at all events shall . I have not done what '
157672	157680	157681	157681	Rhoda	197	' No I ca n't hear this , '
157694	157702	157681	157681	Rhoda	197	' I will believe you without this . '
157719	157729	157731	157731	Rhoda	197	' We wo n't talk any more of it , '
157740	157762	157731	157731	Rhoda	197	' You have done all that could be asked of you . I am grateful to you for coming on my account .
157768	157833	157844	157844	her	195	' Will you hear what I have to say , Miss Nunn ? Will you hear it as a friend ? I want to put myself right in your thoughts . I have told no one else ; I shall be easier in mind if you will hear me . My husband will know everything before very long but perhaps I shall not be alive '
157871	157880	157882	157882	Rhoda	197	' Why should you wish to tell me ? '
157885	157943	157975	157975	she	195	' Because you are so strong . You will say something that will help me . I know you think that I have committed a sin which it is a shame to speak of . That is n't true . If it were true I should never consent to go and live in my husband 's house . '
157944	157951	157975	157975	she	195	' You are returning to him ? '
157952	157962	157975	157975	she	195	' I forgot that I have n't told you . '
158003	158017	158018	158018	she	195	' There is a reason why I consent to be supported by him , '
158021	158103	158018	158018	she	195	' If it were true that I had sinned as he suspects I would rather kill myself than pretend still to be his wife . The day before he had me watched I thought I had left him forever . I thought that if I went back to the house again it would only be to get a few things that I needed . It was some one who lived in the same building as Mr. Barfoot . You have met him '
158140	158146	158148	158148	Monica	195	' He has left England , '
158156	158201	158148	158148	Monica	195	' I thought then that I should go away with him . But it was impossible . I loved him or thought I loved him ; but I was guiltless of anything more than consenting to leave my husband . Will you believe me ? '
158202	158212	158260	158260	she	3275	' Yes , Monica , I do believe you . '
158213	158236	158148	158148	Monica	195	' If you have any doubt , I can show you a letter he wrote to me from abroad , which will prove '
158237	158243	158260	158260	she	3275	' I believe you absolutely . '
158244	158258	158148	158148	Monica	195	' But let me tell you more . I must explain how the misunderstanding '
158292	158326	158260	158260	she	3275	' What shall I do , Miss Nunn ? How can I live until ? I know it 's only for a short time . My wretched life will soon be at an end '
158327	158337	158260	158260	she	3275	' Monica there is one thing you must remember . '
158363	158373	158260	158260	she	3275	' Tell me give me what help you can . '
158374	158403	158260	158260	she	3275	' Life seems so bitter to you that you are in despair . Yet is n't it your duty to live as though some hope were before you ? '
158409	158412	158413	158413	she	195	' You mean '
158416	158475	158260	158260	she	3275	' I think you will understand . I am not speaking of your husband . Whether you have duties to him or not I ca n't say ; that is for your own mind and heart to determine . But is n't it true that your health has a graver importance than if you yourself only were concerned ? '
158476	158482	158413	158413	she	195	' Yes you have understood me '
158483	158530	158260	158260	she	3275	' Is n't it your duty to remember at every moment that your thoughts , your actions , may affect another life that by heedlessness , by abandoning yourself to despair , you may be the cause of suffering it was in your power to avert ? '
158659	158674	158648	158648	she	3277	' Why do you encourage that fear of your life coming to an end ? '
158675	158702	158648	158648	she	3277	' It 's more a hope than a fear at most times . I can see nothing before me . I do n't wish to live . '
158703	158740	158648	158648	she	3277	' That 's morbid . It is n't yourself that speaks , but your trouble . You are young and strong , and in a year 's time very much of this unhappiness will have passed . '
158741	158761	158648	158648	she	3277	' I have felt it like a certainty as if it had been foretold to me ever since I knew '
158762	158819	158648	158648	she	3277	' I think it very likely that young wives have often the same dread . It is physical , Monica , and in your case there is so little relief from dark brooding . But again you must think of your responsibility . You will live , because the poor little life will need your care . '
158828	158836	158648	158648	she	3277	' I shall not love my child . '
158837	158884	158648	158648	she	3277	' Yes , you will . And that love , that duty , is the life to which you must look forward . You have suffered a great deal , but after such sorrow as yours there comes quietness and resignation . Nature will help you . '
158885	158958	158648	158648	she	3277	' Oh , if you could give me some of your strength ! I have never been able to look at life as you do . I should never have married him if I had n't been tempted by the thoughts of living easily and I feared so that I might always be alone My sisters are so miserable ; it terrified me to think of struggling on through life as they do '
158959	159032	158648	158648	she	3277	' Your mistake was in looking only at the weak women . You had other examples before you girls like Miss Vesper and Miss Haven , who live bravely and work hard and are proud of their place in the world . But it 's idle to talk of the past , and just as foolish to speak as if you were sorrowing without hope . How old are you , Monica ? '
159033	159040	158648	158648	she	3277	' Two - and - twenty . '
159041	159263	158648	158648	she	3277	' Well , I am two - and - thirty and I do n't call myself old . When you have reached my age I prophesy you will smile at your despair of ten years ago . At your age one talks so readily of " wrecked life " and " hopeless future , " and all that kind of thing . My dear girl , you may live to be one of the most contented and most useful women in England . Your life is n't wrecked at all nonsense ! You have gone through a storm , that 's true ; but more likely than not you will be all the better for it . Do n't talk or think about sins ; simply make up your mind that you wo n't be beaten by trials and hardships . There can not can there ? be the least doubt as to how you ought to live through these next coming months . Your duty is perfectly clear . Strengthen yourself in body and mind . You have a mind , which is more than can be said of a great many women . Think bravely and nobly of yourself ! Say to yourself : This and that it is in me to do , and I will do it ! '
159282	159331	158648	158648	she	3277	' I knew you could say something that would help me . You have a way of speaking . But it is n't only now . I shall be so far away , and so lonely , all through the dark winter . Will you write to me ? '
159332	159343	158648	158648	she	3277	' Gladly . And tell you all we are doing . '
159364	159420	158648	158648	she	3277	' We seemed to have lost you ; but before long you will be one of us again . I mean , you will be one of the women who are fighting in woman 's cause . You will prove by your life that we can be responsible human beings trustworthy , conscious of purpose . '
159421	159447	158648	158648	she	3277	' Tell me do you think it right for me to live with my husband when I ca n't even regard him as a friend ? '
159448	159574	158648	158648	she	3277	' In that I dare not counsel you . If you can think of him as a friend , in time to come , surely it will be better . But here you must guide yourself . You seem to have made a very sensible arrangement , and before long you will see many things more clearly . Try to recover health health ; that is what you need . Drink in the air of the Severn Sea ; it will be a cordial to you after this stifling London . Next summer I shall I hope I shall be at Cheddar , and then I shall come over to Clevedon and we shall laugh and talk as if we had never known a care . '
159575	159594	158648	158648	she	3277	' Ah , if that time were come ! But you have done me good . I shall try '
159598	159604	159606	159606	Rhoda	197	' I must n't forget , '
159613	159677	159606	159606	Rhoda	197	' that I owe you thanks . You have done what you felt was right in spite of all it cost you ; and you have very greatly relieved my mind . Of course it is all a secret between us . If I make it understood that a doubt is no longer troubling me I shall never say how it was removed . '
159678	159687	159606	159606	Rhoda	197	' How I wish I had come before . '
159688	159719	159606	159606	Rhoda	197	' For your own sake , if I have really helped you , I wish you had . But as for anything else it is much better as it is . '
159755	159760	159742	159742	She	195	' Good - bye ! '
159761	159766	159767	159767	They	3281	' Till next summer . '
159958	159961	159982	159983	its women	3292	' smart , '
160127	160129	160159	160159	Everard	242	' movement '
160643	160663	160636	160636	he	242	' I have often wished to come here , Mary . Show me over the premises , will you ? '
160664	160670	160627	160627	she	213	' That was your purpose ? '
160671	160686	160636	160636	he	242	' No , not altogether . But you know how your work interests me . '
160730	160739	160627	160627	she	213	' I want to hear about Miss Nunn . '
160740	160755	160777	160777	she	3317	' To hear about her ? Pray , what do you wish to hear ? '
160756	160761	160627	160627	she	213	' Is she well ? '
160762	160767	160777	160777	she	3317	' Very well indeed . '
160768	160770	160627	160627	she	213	' I 'm
160783	160783	160777	160777	she	3317	'
160784	160799	160777	160777	she	3317	' Let me see I do n't think she has referred to you lately . '
160804	160834	160800	160800	Everard	242	' Do n't let us play a comedy , Mary . I want to talk very seriously . Shall I tell you what happened when I went to Seascale ? '
160835	160846	160777	160777	she	3317	' Ah , you went to Seascale , did you ? '
160847	160854	160855	160855	he	242	' Did n't you know that ? '
160877	160886	160777	160777	she	3317	' You went when Miss Nunn was there ? '
160887	160908	160777	160777	she	3317	' Of course . You must have known I was going , when I asked you for her Seascale address . '
160909	160930	160777	160777	she	3317	' And what did happen ? I shall be glad to hear if you feel at liberty to tell me . '
160978	160992	160941	160941	he	242	' The end of it was that Miss Nunn consented to marry me . '
160993	160997	160941	160941	he	242	' She consented ? '
160998	161005	160941	160941	he	242	' That comes as a surprise ? '
161006	161011	160941	160941	he	242	' Please go on . '
161012	161136	160941	160941	he	242	' Well , we arranged everything . Rhoda was to stay till the fifteen days were over , and the marriage would have been there . But then arrived your letter , and we quarrelled about it . I was n't disposed to beg and pray for justice . I told Rhoda that her wish for evidence was an insult , that I would take no step to understand Mrs. Widdowson 's behaviour . Rhoda was illogical , I think . She did not refuse to take my word , but she would n't marry me until the thing was cleared up . I told her that she must investigate it for herself , and so we parted in no very good temper . '
161193	161204	161205	161205	Everard	242	' Now I want to ask you a plain question , '
161208	161229	161205	161205	Everard	242	' That letter you wrote to me at Ostend did it represent Rhoda 's mind as well as your own ? '
161230	161248	161189	161189	Mary	213	' It 's quite impossible for me to say . I did n't know Rhoda 's mind . '
161249	161291	161205	161205	Everard	242	' Well , perhaps that is a satisfactory answer . It implies , no doubt , that she was still resolved not to concede the point on which I insisted . But since then ? Has she come to a decision ? '
161322	161336	161315	161315	she	213	' I have no means of judging how she regards you , Everard . '
161337	161348	161315	161315	she	213	' It is possible she even thinks me a liar ? '
161349	161363	161364	161364	He	3322	' I understood you to say that she never refused to believe you . '
161371	161379	161315	161315	she	213	' Plainly you will tell me nothing ? '
161380	161387	161315	161315	she	213	' I have nothing to tell . '
161388	161405	161315	161315	she	213	' Then I suppose I must see Rhoda . Perhaps she will refuse to admit me ? '
161406	161422	161315	161315	she	213	' I ca n't say . But if she does her meaning would be unmistakable . '
161423	161426	161427	161427	he	3322	' Cousin Mary '
161433	161446	161427	161427	he	3322	' I think you will be very glad if she does refuse . '
161467	161520	161447	161447	She	3323	' No . I have no such feeling . Whatever you both agree upon will satisfy me . So come by all means if you wish . I can have nothing to do with it . You had better write and ask her if she will see you , I should think . '
161579	161593	161572	161572	he	242	' You think I have behaved rather badly let us say , harshly ? '
161594	161613	161572	161572	he	242	' I am not so foolish as to form any judgment in such a case , cousin Everard . '
161614	161635	161572	161572	he	242	' Speaking as a woman , should you say that Rhoda had reason on her side in the first instance ? '
161636	161640	161641	161641	Mary	213	' I think , '
161650	161678	161641	161641	Mary	213	' that she was not unreasonable in wishing to postpone her marriage until she knew what was to be the result of Mrs. Widdowson 's indiscreet behaviour . '
161679	161687	161688	161688	Everard	242	' Well , perhaps she was not , '
161692	161700	161572	161572	he	242	' And what has been the result ? '
161701	161727	161572	161572	he	242	' I only know that Mrs. Widdowson has left London and gone to live at a house her husband has taken somewhere in the country . '
161728	161730	161572	161572	he	242	' I 'm
161760	161760	161742	161744	the little lady	3324	'
161761	161766	161767	161767	Mary	213	' And to me , '
161775	161816	161572	161572	he	242	' Well , then , let us take it for granted that I was rather harsh with Rhoda . But suppose she still meets me with the remark that things are just as they were that nothing has been explained ? '
161817	161828	161572	161572	he	242	' I ca n't discuss your relations with Miss Nunn . '
161829	161863	161572	161572	he	242	' However , you defend her original action . Be so good as to admit that I ca n't go to Mrs. Widdowson and request her to publish a statement that I have never '
161864	161870	161872	161873	Miss Barfoot	212	' I shall admit nothing , '
161877	161900	161872	161873	Miss Barfoot	212	' I have advised you to see Miss Nunn if she is willing . And there 's nothing more to be said . '
161901	161910	161572	161572	he	242	' Good . I will write to her . '
162051	162086	162048	162048	he	3325	' I had made up my mind never to come until you let me know that I was tried and acquitted But after all it is better to have reason on one 's side . '
162087	162091	162093	162093	Rhoda	197	' Much better , '
162148	162159	162130	162130	he	315	' I suppose you would never have written to me ? '
162160	162163	162164	162164	she	197	' Never , '
162168	162184	162130	162130	he	315	' Because you are too proud , or because the mystery is still a mystery ? '
162185	162193	162130	162130	he	315	' There is no longer any mystery . '
162201	162212	162130	162130	he	315	' Indeed ? You have discovered what it all meant ? '
162213	162223	162130	162130	he	315	' Yes , I know what it all meant . '
162224	162233	162130	162130	he	315	' Can you gratify my not unnatural curiosity ? '
162234	162251	162130	162130	he	315	' I can say nothing about it , except that I know how the misunderstanding arose . '
162283	162315	162130	162130	he	315	' And it did n't occur to you that it would be a kindness , not inconsistent with your dignity , to make me in some way acquainted with this fact ? '
162316	162325	162130	162130	he	315	' I feel no uneasiness on your account . '
162329	162350	162326	162326	Everard	242	' Splendidly frank , as of old . You really did n't care in the least how much I suffered ? '
162351	162367	162130	162130	he	315	' You misunderstand me . I felt sure that you did n't suffer at all . '
162368	162389	162326	162326	Everard	242	' Ah , I see . You imagined me calm in the assurance that I should some day be justified . '
162390	162399	162401	162401	Rhoda	197	' I had every reason for imagining it , '
162403	162414	162401	162401	Rhoda	197	' Other wise , you would have given some sign . '
162534	162545	162546	162546	he	242	' It was not for me to give any sign , '
162549	162566	162546	162546	he	242	' Yet you have said that it is well to have reason on one 's side . '
162590	162612	162626	162626	Her	197	' Admit , then , that an approach was due from me . I have made it . I am here . '
162685	162691	162692	162692	he	242	' So we go back , '
162695	162709	162692	162692	he	242	' to our day at Wastwater . The perfect day was n't it ? '
162710	162719	162721	162721	Rhoda	197	' I shall never wish to forget it , '
162724	162739	162759	162759	He	242	' And we stand as when we quitted each other that night do we ? '
162745	162750	162740	162740	She	197	' I think not . '
162751	162758	162759	162759	He	242	' Then what is the difference ? '
162772	162780	162781	162781	she	197	' You are conscious of no difference ? '
162784	162810	162759	162759	He	242	' Months have lapsed . We are different because we are older . But you speak as if you were conscious of some greater change . '
162811	162862	162759	162759	He	242	' Yes , you are changed noticeably . I thought I knew you ; perhaps I did . Now I should have to learn you all over again . It is difficult , you see , for me to keep pace with you . Your opportunities are so much wider . '
162900	162909	162910	162910	he	3331	' I try not to waste my life , '
162914	162921	162910	162910	he	3331	' I have made new acquaintances . '
162922	162930	162759	162759	He	242	' Will you tell me about them ? '
162931	162991	162910	162910	he	3331	' Tell me first about yourself . You say you would never have written to me . That means , I think , that you never loved me . When you found that I had been wrongly suspected and you suspected me yourself , say what you will if you had loved me , you would have asked forgiveness . '
162992	163026	162759	162759	He	242	' I have a like reason for doubting your love . If you had loved me you could never have waited so long without trying to remove the obstacle that was between us . '
163027	163037	163039	163039	Everard	242	' It was you who put the obstacle there , '
163043	163060	162759	162759	He	242	' No . An unlucky chance did that . Or a lucky one . Who knows ? '
163186	163191	163192	163192	he	242	' Well , now , '
163195	163215	163192	163192	he	242	' there 's the question which we must decide . If you incline to think that the chance was fortunate '
163221	163230	163302	163302	She	197	' We must know each other 's mind . '
163231	163239	163240	163240	Rhoda	197	' Ah , that is so difficult ! '
163252	163301	163240	163240	Rhoda	197	' Yes , unless we give each other help . Let us imagine ourselves back at Seascale , down by the waves . How cold and grim it must be there to - night ! I repeat what I said then : Rhoda , will you marry me ? '
163308	163316	163302	163302	She	197	' You did n't say that then . '
163317	163324	163240	163240	Rhoda	197	' What do the words matter ? '
163325	163333	163334	163334	He	242	' That was not what you said . '
163370	163383	163384	163384	Everard	242	' Why do you want me to repeat exactly what I said ? '
163392	163417	163352	163352	She	197	' You speak of the " perfect day . " Did n't the day 's perfection end before there was any word of marriage ? '
163475	163484	163450	163450	she	197	' Who first used the word , Rhoda ? '
163485	163491	163450	163450	she	197	' Yes ; I did . '
163513	163516	163517	163517	he	242	' Perhaps , '

163545	163567	163531	163531	She	197	' Not quite serious ? Yes , I have thought that . And were you quite serious in anything you said ? '
163568	163573	163574	163574	he	242	' I loved you , '
163583	163589	163531	163531	She	197	' Yet wanted to see whether '
163601	163618	163531	163531	She	197	' I loved you , that 's all . And I believe I still love you . '
163626	163632	163633	163633	he	242	' Will you marry me ? '
163641	163652	163619	163619	Rhoda	197	' I think you are " not quite serious " . '
163653	163667	163619	163619	Rhoda	197	' I have asked you twice . I ask for the third time . '
163668	163680	163681	163681	Rhoda	197	' I wo n't marry you with the forms of marriage , '
163690	163702	163619	163619	Rhoda	197	' Now it is you who play with a serious matter . '
163703	163754	163619	163619	Rhoda	197	' You said we had both changed . I see now that our " perfect day " was marred by my weakness at the end . If you wish to go back in imagination to that summer night , restore everything , only let me be what I now am . '
163760	163774	163757	163757	his	242	' Impossible . It must be then or now for both of us . '
163775	163779	163780	163780	she	197	' Legal marriage , '
163787	163798	163780	163780	she	197	' has acquired some new sanction for you since then ? '
163799	163808	163757	163757	his	242	' On the whole , perhaps it has . '
163809	163827	163780	163780	she	197	' Naturally . But I shall never marry , so we will speak no more of it . '
163855	163869	163834	163834	she	197	' In other words , then , you have ceased to love me ? '
163870	163879	163834	163834	she	197	' Yes , I no longer love you . '
163880	163897	163834	163834	she	197	' Yet , if I had been willing to revive that fantastic idealism as you thought it '
163903	163908	163834	163834	she	197	' What was it ? '
163909	163930	163834	163834	she	197	' Oh , a kind of idealism undoubtedly . I was so bent on making sure that you loved me . '
163934	163972	163931	163931	She	197	' After all , the perfection of our day was half make - believe . You never loved me with entire sincerity . And you will never love any woman even as well as you loved me . '
163973	163987	163834	163834	she	197	' Upon my soul , I believe it , Rhoda . And even now '
163988	164026	163931	163931	She	197	' And even now it is just possible for us to say goodbye with something like friendliness . But not if you talk longer . Do n't let us spoil it ; things are so straight and clear '
164086	164141	164083	164083	he	3335	' I am about to do my duty as you put it that is , to marry . The name of my future wife is Miss Agnes Brissenden . It will be in March , I think . But I shall see you before then , and give you a fuller account of myself . '

He no longer held himself upright , and when out of doors seldom raised his eyes from the ground ; grey streaks had begun to brindle his hair ; his face grew yellower and more deeply furrowed . Of his personal appearance , even of cleanliness , he became neglectful , and occasionally it happened that he lay in bed all through the morning , reading , dozing , or in a state of mental vacuity .

164538	164680	164490	164491	Mrs. Luke	265	' Among the English who this year elected to take their repose and recreation at Trouville there was no more brilliant figure than Mrs. Luke Widdowson . This lady is well known in the monde where one never s'ennuie ; where smart people are gathered together , there is the charming widow sure to be seen . We are able to announce that , before leaving Trouville , Mrs. Widdowson had consented to a private engagement with Capt . William Horrocks no other , indeed , than " Captain Bill , " the universal favourite , so beloved by hostesses as a sure dancing man . By the lamented death of his father , this best of good fellows has now become Sir William , and we understand that his marriage will be celebrated after the proper delays . Our congratulations ! '
164902	164918	164880	164880	she	322	' Now look here , Edmund . Tell the whole story from the first . You 're
164942	164995	164880	164880	she	322	'm not a bad sort , you know , and I have troubles of my own I do n't mind telling you so much . Women make fools of themselves well , never mind . Just tell me about the little girl , and see if we ca n't square things somehow . '

165028	165037	165039	165039	Widdowson	217	' I am expecting to hear from them , '
165061	165066	165099	165100	Lady Horrocks	322	' To hear what ? '
165067	165076	165099	165100	Lady Horrocks	322	' I think I shall be sent for . '
165077	165086	165099	165100	Lady Horrocks	322	' Sent for ? To make it up ? '
165087	165098	165099	165100	Lady Horrocks	322	' She is going to give birth to a child . '
165111	165119	165099	165100	Lady Horrocks	322	' How did you find this out ? '
165120	165154	165099	165100	Lady Horrocks	322	' I have known it long enough . Her sister Virginia told me before they went away . I had a suspicion all at once , and I forced her to tell me . '
165155	165166	165099	165100	Lady Horrocks	322	' And if you are sent for shall you go ? '
165177	165192	165167	165167	Widdowson	217	' I shall hear what she has to tell me , as she promised . '
165193	165200	165099	165100	Lady Horrocks	322	' Is it is it possible ? '
165235	165268	165231	165231	he	217	' Whatever she tells me how can I believe it ? When once a woman has lied how can she ever again be believed ? I ca n't be sure of anything . '
165269	165274	165276	165277	Lady Horrocks	322	' All that fibbing , '
165279	165309	165276	165277	Lady Horrocks	322	' has an unpleasant look . No denying it . She got entangled somehow . But I think you had better believe that she pulled up just in time . '
165310	165319	165320	165320	he	217	' I have no love for her left , '
165328	165492	165320	165320	he	217	' It all perished in those frightful days . I tried hard to think that I still loved her . I kept writing letters but they meant nothing or they only meant that I was driven half crazy by wretchedness . I had rather we lived on as we have been doing . It 's miserable enough for me , God knows ; but it would be worse to try and behave to her as if I could forget everything . I know her explanation wo n't satisfy me . Whatever it is I shall still suspect her . I do n't know that the child is mine . It may be . Perhaps as it grows up there will be a likeness to help me to make sure . But what a life ! Every paltry trifle will make me uneasy ; and if I discovered any fresh deceit I should do something terrible . You do n't know how near I was '
165500	165508	165510	165511	Lady Horrocks	322	' The Othello business wo n't do , '
165515	165651	165510	165511	Lady Horrocks	322	' You could n't have gone on together , of course ; you had to part for a time . Well , that 's all over ; take it as something that could n't be helped . You were behaving absurdly , you know ; I told you plainly ; I guessed there 'd be trouble . You ought n't to have married at all , that 's the fact ; it would be better for most of us if we kept out of it . Some marry for a good reason , some for a bad , and mostly it all comes to the same in the end . But there , never mind . Pull yourself together , dear boy . It 's all nonsense about not caring for her . Of course you 're
165752	165806	165751	165751	You	3362	're an honest man , and it is n't every woman never mind . I could tell you stories about people but you would n't care to hear them . Just take things with a laugh we all have to . Life 's as you take it : all gloom or moderately shiny . '
166355	166360	166361	166361	he	217	' Is it over ? '
166375	166381	166383	166383	Alice	185	' At four this afternoon , '
166390	166395	166383	166383	Alice	185	' A little girl . '
166396	166403	166405	166405	Virginia	191	' She had to have chloroform , '
166423	166429	166383	166383	Alice	185	' And all 's well ? '
166430	166438	166439	166439	they	3391	' We think so we hope so , '
166489	166497	166481	166481	its	3394	' She knows you sent for me ? '
166498	166520	166459	166461	a good nurse	3393	' Yes . And we have something to give you . You were to have this as soon as you arrived . '
166561	166569	166570	166570	he	217	' I must have something to eat , '
166577	166587	166570	166570	he	217	' When the doctor comes I 'll see him . '
166616	166619	166606	166607	the doctor	352	' fairly well '
166797	166803	166805	166805	she	195	' I only make this confession '
166807	166911	166805	166805	she	195	' for the sake of the poor child that will soon be born . The child is yours , and ought not to suffer because of what I did . The enclosed letter will prove this to you , if anything can . For myself I ask nothing . I do n't think I shall live . If I do I will consent to anything you propose . I only ask you to behave without any pretence ; if you can not forgive me , do not make a show of it . Say what your will is , and that shall be enough '
167320	167328	167330	167331	Miss Madden	204	' She has been inquiring about you , '
167334	167339	167363	167363	His	3403	' How is she ? '
167340	167358	167363	167363	His	3403	' Not worse , I believe . But so very weak . She wishes me to ask you '
167359	167362	167363	167363	His	3403	' What ? '
167372	167417	167363	167363	His	3403	' I shall be obliged to tell her something . If I have nothing to say she will fret herself into a dangerous state . She wants to know if you have read her letter , and if if you will see the child . '
167435	167449	167427	167428	Miss Madden	204	' Oh , do n't refuse ! Let me give her some comfort . '
167450	167460	167427	167428	Miss Madden	204	' It 's the child she 's anxious about ? '
167479	167486	167487	167487	he	2580	' Say I will see it , '
167490	167505	167487	167487	he	2580	' and have it brought into some room then say I have seen it . '
167506	167517	167551	167551	he	2580	' May n't I take her a word of forgiveness ? '
167518	167536	167487	167487	he	2580	' Yes , say I forgive her . She does n't wish me to go to her ? '
167542	167549	167551	167551	he	2580	' Then say I forgive her . '
167876	167886	167887	167887	she	185	' But there 's something I must tell you , '
167898	167908	167887	167887	she	185	' Poor Virginia wishes to go into an institution . '
167967	167978	167980	167980	Alice	185	' You know that we are by no means penniless , '
167982	168002	167980	167980	Alice	185	' We can very well bear the expense . But will you assist us to find a suitable place ? '
168013	168020	168022	168023	Miss Madden	204	' And when she is cured , '
168025	168098	168022	168023	Miss Madden	204	' she shall come and live with me . And when baby is about two years old we will do what we have been purposing for a long time . We will open a school for young children , either here or at Weston . That will afford my poor sister occupation . Indeed , we shall both be better for the exertion of such an undertaking do n't you think so ? '
168099	168113	168003	168003	He	3441	' It would be a wise thing , I have no doubt whatever . '
168336	168345	168312	168312	She	197	' Poor little child ! Dear little child ! '
168406	168413	168415	168416	Miss Nunn	197	' And where is your sister ? '
168418	168456	168415	168416	Miss Nunn	197	' Staying with friends at present . She will be back before long , I hope . And as soon as baby can walk we are going to think very seriously about the school . You remember ? '
168457	168468	168415	168416	Miss Nunn	197	' The school ? You will really make the attempt ? '
168469	168483	168484	168484	she	185	' It will be so good for us both . Why , look , '
168488	168497	168484	168484	she	185	' here is one pupil growing for us ! '
168498	168506	168508	168508	Rhoda	197	' Make a brave woman of her , '
168511	168530	168415	168416	Miss Nunn	197	' We will try ah , we will try ! And is your work as successful as ever ? '
168531	168534	168536	168536	Rhoda	197	' More ! '
168538	168611	168536	168536	Rhoda	197	' We flourish like the green bay - tree . We shall have to take larger premises . By - the - bye , you must read the paper we are going to publish ; the first number will be out in a month , though the name is n't quite decided upon yet . Miss Barfoot was never in such health and spirit nor I myself . The world is moving ! '
168689	168694	168686	168686	she	197	' Poor little child ! '
