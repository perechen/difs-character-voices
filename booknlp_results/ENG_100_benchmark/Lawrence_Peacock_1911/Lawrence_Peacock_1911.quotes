506	546	487	487	he	433	" It does n't hurt him I wanted to see if it was because he could n't spread his wings that he could n't fly . There he goes no , he does n't . Let 's try another . "

1806	1845	1802	1802	he	479	" you 've made her as sharp as yourself , I see , since you 've had her in Standard Six . I 'll try a potato , mother , if you can find one that 's done . "
1846	1888	1934	1934	she	114	" Well , George , they seem mixed , I 'm sure that was done that I tried . There they are mixed look at this one , it 's soft enough . I 'm sure they were boiling long enough . "

3202	3243	3196	3196	mother	4146	" I only wondered if I could just strum out this old tune ; I learned it when I was quite a girl , on this piano . It was a cracked one then ; the only one I had . "
3244	3279	3281	3281	Lettie	116	" But play again , dearie , do play again . It was like the clinking of lustre glasses , and you look so quaint at the piano . Do play , my dear ! "
3283	3286	3288	3289	my mother	515	" Nay , "
3291	3320	3288	3289	my mother	515	" the touch of the old keys on my fingers is making me sentimental you would n't like to see me reduced to the tears of old age ? "
3321	3325	3327	3327	Lettie	116	" Old age ! "
3333	3349	3327	3327	Lettie	116	" You are young enough to play little romances . Tell us about it mother . "
3350	3356	3288	3289	my mother	515	" About what , child ? "
3357	3364	3327	3327	Lettie	116	" When you used to play . "

3392	3399	3401	3401	I.	0	" Only down to Strelley Mill , "
3402	3406	3408	3408	mother	4146	" Of course , "
3411	3418	3419	3419	I	0	" Why ' of course ' ? "
3422	3435	3437	3437	Lettie	116	" And you came away as soon as Em went to school ? "

3466	3475	3463	3463	I	0	" They would have me stay to dinner . "

3497	3500	3501	3501	I	0	" No , "
3504	3521	3501	3501	I	0	" he never will at this rate . Nobody will ever be good enough for him . "

3626	3633	3635	3635	Lettie	116	" He is rather good looking , "
3640	3653	3654	3654	I	0	" You could make a man of him , I am sure , "

3837	3840	3842	3842	she	116	" Indeed ! "
3844	3852	3842	3842	she	116	" He 's as good as most folk "
3860	3863	3864	3864	she	116	" Not , "
3868	3890	3864	3864	she	116	" that I think anything about him . I 'm merely going for a game of tennis . Are you coming ? "
3891	3900	3901	3901	I	0	" What shall you say if I agree ? "
3904	3907	3908	3908	she	116	" Oh ! "
3913	3924	3908	3908	she	116	" We shall all be very pleased I 'm sure . "
3925	3928	3930	3930	I	0	" Ooray ! "

4470	4477	4446	4446	he	121	" But whose were the kisses ? "
4478	4484	4485	4485	he	121	" Who produced the sensation ? "
4488	4499	4446	4446	he	121	" Since I only tapped your nose you should dream of "
4500	4504	4506	4506	he	121	" Go on ! "
4510	4515	4516	4516	she	116	" Of Doctor Slop , "

4548	4556	4557	4557	she	116	" No your nose is quite classic , "
4908	4917	4919	4919	Lettie	116	" What has frightened the crazy little things ? "
4921	4953	4919	4919	Lettie	116	" I do n't know . They 've cheek enough sometimes ; then they go whining , skelping off from a fancy as if they had a snake under their wings . "
5010	5015	5007	5007	her	116	" Oh , Cyril ! "
5078	5086	5088	5088	Lettie	116	" How cruel oh , how cruel ! "

5181	5191	5193	5193	I	0	" It is one of the Strelley Mill cats , "
5195	5204	5193	5193	I	0	" and so I 'll take her home . "
5243	5252	5254	5254	I	0	" I have brought poor Mrs. Nickie Ben , "

5304	5323	5325	5325	Mollie	114	" I wish keepers had to sit two or three days with their bare ankles in a trap , "
5424	5431	5433	5433	Mollie	114	" Look at Mrs. Nickie Ben , "
5449	5452	5454	5454	he	125	" Broken , "
5456	5460	5462	5462	Emily	109	" How awful ! "
5472	5475	5476	5476	I	0	" Both ? "

5530	5538	5539	5539	he	125	" Put her out of her misery , "
5555	5560	5562	5562	he	125	" The quickest way , "
5564	5578	5562	5562	he	125	" is to swing her round and knock her head against the wall . "
5579	5585	5587	5587	Lettie	116	" You make me sick , "
5589	5596	5597	5597	he	125	" I 'll drown her then , "
5644	5653	5655	5655	he	125	" You 're not coming , are you ? "
5668	5675	5676	5676	he	125	" It 'll make you sick , "
5711	5721	5703	5703	he	125	" Now for it ! you are chief mourners . "
5743	5752	5728	5728	he	125	" Good - bye , Mrs. Nickie Ben . "
5766	5769	5771	5771	Lettie	116	" Cyril , "
5774	5785	5771	5771	Lettie	116	" is n't it cruel ? is n't it awful ? "
5792	5798	5800	5800	George	108	" Do you mean me ? "
5802	5821	5822	5822	He	125	" Not you in particular everything ! If we move the blood rises in our heel - prints . "
5832	5842	5844	5844	he	125	" I had to drown her out of mercy , "
5879	5882	5884	5884	he	125	" If , "
5886	5905	5884	5884	he	125	" the poor old cat had made a prettier corpse , you 'd have thrown violets on her . "
5925	5928	5929	5929	he	125	" Well , "
5937	5951	5929	5929	he	125	" have n't her good looks gone ! She was a fine cat . "
5952	5959	5960	5960	Lettie	116	" Bury it and have done , "
5968	5977	5963	5963	He	125	" Shall you have bad dreams after it ? "
5978	5985	5986	5986	she	116	" Dreams do not trouble me , "
6065	6071	6073	6073	Emily	109	" Has he done it ? "
6074	6106	6073	6073	Emily	109	" and did you watch him ? If I had seen it I should have hated the sight of him , and I 'd rather have touched a maggot than him . "
6107	6119	6121	6121	Lettie	116	" I should n't be particularly pleased if he touched me , "
6123	6134	6136	6136	Emily	109	" There is something so loathsome about callousness and brutality , "
6138	6145	6136	6136	Emily	109	" He fills me with disgust . "
6146	6150	6152	6152	Lettie	116	" Does he ? "
6165	6182	6183	6183	She	116	" He 's only healthy . He 's never been sick , not anyway , yet . "
6387	6400	6401	6401	he	108	" Why do n't you play something with a tune in it ? "
6414	6418	6419	6419	she	116	" A tune ! "
6496	6502	6503	6503	she	116	" What shall I play ? "
6532	6540	6541	6541	she	116	" Which do you want to sing ? "
6555	6560	6549	6549	his	108	" Anything you like . "
6561	6566	6567	6567	she	116	" A love song ? "
6570	6579	6580	6580	he	108	" If you like yes , a love song "
6602	6606	6607	6607	He	108	" Tit Willow . "
6630	6639	6627	6627	she	116	" Drink to me only with thine eyes . "
6679	6694	6695	6695	she	116	" That 's because you have no wine in your eyes to pledge with , "
6735	6738	6739	6739	she	116	" Because , "
6751	6803	6739	6739	she	116	" because there 's no change in your eyes when I look at you . I always think people who are worth much talk with their eyes . That 's why you are forced to respect many quite uneducated people . Their eyes are so eloquent , and full of knowledge . "
6879	6890	6891	6891	she	116	" There 's nothing in this book nice to sing , "
6909	6914	6907	6907	she	116	" Should he upbraid . "
6958	6963	6965	6965	she	116	" You like that , "
7005	7009	7010	7010	he	108	" I do , "
7019	7051	7052	7052	she	116	" I 'd rather ' dance and sing ' round ' wrinkled care ' than carefully shut the door on him , while I slept in the chimney would n't you ? "
7069	7074	7075	7075	she	116	" As you do , "
7078	7081	7082	7082	he	108	" What ? "
7085	7094	7063	7063	she	116	" Keep half your senses asleep half alive . "
7095	7099	7100	7100	he	108	" Do I ? "
7103	7138	7139	7139	she	116	" Of course you do ; ' bos - bovis ; an ox . ' You are like a stalled ox , food and comfort , no more . Do n't you love comfort ? "
7142	7147	7148	7148	he	108	" Do n't you ? "

7511	7518	7498	7498	she	116	" You are worse and worse . "
7543	7554	7555	7555	she	116	" Is n't it time to go home , Pat ? "

9978	9988	9990	9990	George	108	" You do n't seem to have nice dreams , "
10004	10010	9992	9993	The man	655	" And who are you ? "
10031	10034	10035	10035	he	655	" So ! "
10042	10053	10035	10035	he	655	" I do dream . I do , I do . "

11989	12031	11987	11987	she	116	" and when you 're boyish you 'll be a very decent man . A mere man dare n't be a boy for fear of tumbling off his manly dignity , and then he 'd be a fool , poor thing . "

12267	12326	12261	12261	she	116	" Some look at my hair , some watch the rise and fall of my breathing , some look at my neck , and a few , not you among them , look me in the eyes for my thoughts . To you , I 'm a fine specimen , strong ! Pretty strong ! You primitive man ! "
12338	12344	12345	12345	she	116	" Bring your chair up , "

12436	12442	12443	12443	she	116	" Then you ought to , "

12470	12489	12465	12465	She	116	" Why that 's a pertinent question . I think you might be rather nice , you know . "

12501	12504	12505	12505	she	116	" Oh ! "
12508	12528	12505	12505	she	116	" I know , you think you 're perfect , but you 're not , you 're very annoying . "
12529	12532	12534	12534	Alice	218	" Yes , "
12548	12575	12534	12534	Alice	218	" He 's so blooming slow ! Great whizz ! Who wants fellows to carry cold dinners ? Should n't you like to shake him Lettie ? "
12576	12584	12586	12587	the other	689	" I do n't feel concerned enough , "
12590	12600	12602	12602	Alice	218	" Did you ever carry a boiled pudding Georgy ? "
12611	12621	12622	12622	he	689	" Me ! why ? what makes you ask ? "
12630	12652	12534	12534	Alice	218	" Oh , I only wondered if your people needed any indigestion mixture pa mixes it 1 1 1 a bottle . "
12653	12658	12659	12659	he	689	" I do n't see "
12662	12717	12534	12534	Alice	218	" Ta ta , old boy , I 'll give you time to think about it . Good - night , Lettie . Absence makes the heart grow fonder Georgy of someone else . Farewell . Come along , Sybil love , the moon is shining Good - night all , good - night ! "

12774	12818	12772	12772	Lettie	116	" he is a real realist , he makes common things beautiful , he sees the mystery and magnificence that envelops us even when we work menially . I do know and I can speak . If I hoed in the fields beside you "

12855	12866	12867	12867	she	116	" You 'd be just that colour in the sunset , "
12878	13159	12867	12867	she	116	" and if you looked at the ground you 'd find there was a sense of warm gold fire in it , and once you 'd perceived the colour , it would strengthen till you 'd see nothing else . You are blind ; you are only half - born ; you are gross with good living and heavy sleeping . You are a piano which will only play a dozen common notes . Sunset is nothing to you it merely happens anywhere . Oh , but you make me feel as if I 'd like to make you suffer . If you 'd ever been sick ; if you 'd ever been born into a home where there was something oppressed you , and you could n't understand ; if ever you 'd believed , or even doubted , you might have been a man by now . You never grow up , like bulbs which spend all summer getting fat and fleshy , but never wakening the germ of a flower . As for me , the flower is born in me , but it wants bringing forth . Things do n't flower if they 're overfed . You have to suffer before you blossom in this life . When death is just touching a plant , it forces it into a passion of flowering . You wonder how I have touched death . You do n't know . There 's always a sense of death in this home . I believe my mother hated my father before I was born . That was death in her veins for me before I was born . It makes a difference "
13212	13244	13189	13189	She	695	" Oh ! my dear heart , are you bewildered ? How amiable of you to listen to me there is n't any meaning in it all there is n't really ! "
13245	13248	13250	13250	he	693	" But , "
13252	13259	13250	13250	he	693	" why do you say it ? "
13260	13266	13267	13267	she	695	" Oh , the question ! "
13270	13290	13267	13267	she	695	" Let us go back to our muttons , we 're gazing at each other like two dazed images . "
13303	13306	13299	13299	George	108	" There ! "

13367	13370	13371	13371	she	695	" What ? "
13380	13391	13392	13392	He	693	" That a girl like that half afraid and passion ! "

13419	13427	13428	13428	he	693	" But do n't you like it ? "
13438	13480	13433	13433	her	695	" Make love to the next girl you meet , and by the time the poppies redden the field , she 'll hang in your arms . She 'll have need to be more than half afraid , wo n't she ? "
13497	13500	13501	13501	he	693	" But , "
13508	13513	13504	13504	his	693	" it would be rather "
13514	13524	13525	13525	she	695	" Do n't , sweet lad , do n't ! "
13529	13534	13535	13535	he	693	" But I should n't "
13538	13552	13535	13535	he	693	" I do n't know whether I should like any girl I know to "

13755	13765	13766	13766	he	693	" No , I 've never seen it before , "
13769	13774	13775	13775	she	695	" I 'm surprised , "
13778	13786	13775	13775	she	695	" It is a very common one . "
13787	13791	13792	13792	he	693	" Is it ? "
13890	13901	13902	13902	she	695	" I believe it 's in Liverpool , the picture , "
13927	13939	13921	13921	He	693	" I did n't know there was a gallery in Liverpool . "
13940	13950	13951	13951	she	695	" Oh , yes , a very good one , "

18815	18872	18873	18874	The doctor	840	" But he was a jolly decent fellow generous , open - handed . The folks did n't like him , because they could n't get to the bottom of him ; they always hate a thing they ca n't fathom . He was close , there 's no mistake save when he was asleep sometimes . "

19036	19105	19033	19033	he	840	" there are two ways . You can burn your lamp with a big draught , and it 'll flare away , till the oil 's gone , then it 'll stink and smoke itself out . Or you can keep it trim on the kitchen table , dirty your fingers occasionally trimming it up , and it 'll last a long time , and sink out mildly . "

19142	19247	19248	19248	He	840	" Ay , I do n't suppose there 's much to settle . Nor many tears to shed when a fellow spends his years an ' his prime on the Lord knows who , you ca n't expect those that remember him young to feel his loss too keenly . He 'd had his fling in his day , though , ma'am . Ay must ha ' had some rich times . No lasting satisfaction in it though always wanting , craving . There 's nothing like marrying you 've got your dish before you then , and you 've got to eat it . "
19300	19307	19292	19293	the doctor	840	" But what about the funeral ? "
19332	19370	19320	19320	he	840	" Come across to my wife and have a cup of tea . Buried in these dam holes a fellow gets such a boor . Do come my little wife is lonely come just to see her . "
19817	19831	19832	19832	he	677	" I had better go with you to see the vicar , then , "
20009	20019	20025	20025	her	468	" But you will be quite safe with him , "
20126	20135	20136	20136	she	115	" But you 'll do with another cup , "
20204	20210	20211	20211	she	115	" Lettie has been home , "
20214	20220	20222	20222	mother	4146	" And gone back again ? "
20224	20247	20282	20282	Rebecca	115	" She only came to change her dress . She put the green poplin on . She wondered where you 'd gone . "
20248	20255	20282	20282	Rebecca	115	" What did you tell her ? "
20256	20281	20282	20282	Rebecca	115	" I said you 'd just gone out a bit . She said she was glad . She was as lively as a squirrel . "
20295	20307	20291	20292	the latter	627	" He 's dead , Rebecca . I have seen him . "
20308	20322	20282	20282	Rebecca	115	" Now thank God for that no more need to worry over him . "
20323	20335	20291	20292	the latter	627	" Well ! He died all alone , Rebecca all alone . "
20336	20344	20346	20346	Becky	115	" He died as you 've lived , "
20351	20372	20291	20292	the latter	627	" But I 've had the children , I 've had the children we wo n't tell Lettie , Rebecca . "
20373	20377	20378	20378	Rebecca	115	" No ' m. "
20383	20392	20394	20394	mother	4146	" You and Lettie will have the money , "
20425	20438	20447	20447	she	4146	" Well , mother if it 's ours , it 's yours . "
20450	20457	20447	20447	she	4146	" You might have had a father "
20458	20473	20447	20447	she	4146	" We 're thankful we had n't , mother . You spared us that . "
20474	20481	20483	20484	my mother	515	" But how can you tell ? "
20486	20490	20491	20491	I	0	" I can , "

20503	20528	20447	20447	she	4146	" If ever you feel scorn for one who is near you rising in your throat , try and be generous , my lad . "
20529	20531	20533	20533	I.	0	" Well "
20534	20537	20538	20538	she	515	" Yes , "
20541	20557	20538	20538	she	515	" we 'll say no more . Sometime you must tell Lettie you tell her . "
20569	20573	20574	20574	she	515	" Who knows ? "
20581	20589	20633	20633	her	515	" Mother , Becky , and ourselves . "
20590	20594	20633	20633	her	515	" Nobody else ? "
20595	20598	20633	20633	her	515	" No . "
20599	20625	20633	20633	her	515	" Then it 's a good thing he is out of the way if he was such a nuisance to mother . Where is she ? "
20626	20629	20633	20633	her	515	" Upstairs . "
21178	21181	21187	21187	He	121	" Oh ! "
21236	21245	21246	21246	she	116	" Leslie ! oh ! Let me go ! "
21281	21286	21287	21287	she	116	" You are mean ! "
21305	21322	21299	21299	He	121	" You should n't go to sleep then and look so pretty . Who could help ? "
21323	21329	21330	21330	she	116	" It is not nice ! "
21337	21363	21407	21407	Mother	117	" We are not ' nice ' are we ? I thought we were proud of our unconventionality . Why should n't I kiss you ? "
21364	21378	21407	21407	Mother	117	" Because it is a question of me , not of you alone . "
21379	21389	21407	21407	Mother	117	" Dear me , you are in a way ! "
21390	21395	21407	21407	Mother	117	" Mother is coming . "
21396	21406	21407	21407	Mother	117	" Is she ? You had better tell her . "
21414	21419	21420	21420	she	116	" Well , sir , "
21423	21429	21420	21420	she	116	" why are you frowning ? "
21436	21453	21467	21468	my mother	515	" Lettie is scolding me for kissing her when she was playing ' Sleeping Beauty . ' "
21454	21465	21467	21468	my mother	515	" The conceit of the boy , to play Prince ! "
21470	21483	21484	21484	he	121	" Oh , but it appears I was sadly out of character , "
21494	21497	21498	21498	he	121	" Well , "
21507	21517	21498	21498	he	121	" I came to ask you to go out . "

21537	21543	21529	21529	She	4146	" I feel dreadfully lazy . "
21544	21548	21549	21549	he	121	" Never mind ! "
21552	21565	21549	21549	he	121	" you 'll wake up . Go and put your hat on . "
21593	21600	21601	21601	he	121	" She 'll come all right , "
21610	21620	21601	21601	he	121	" She likes to play you on a string . "
21642	21650	21638	21638	she	4146	" You come as well , Pat . "
21662	21672	21673	21673	I	0	" I had rather stay and finish this sketch , "
21679	21691	21692	21692	She	4146	" No , but do come , there 's a dear . "
21725	21729	21730	21730	he	121	" All right ! "
21734	21742	21730	21730	he	121	" Women like to fancy themselves Napoleons . "
21743	21754	21755	21755	she	4146	" They do , dear Iron Duke , they do , "
21758	21770	21771	21771	he	121	" Yet , there 's a Waterloo in all their histories , "
21783	21793	21775	21775	she	4146	" Say Peterloo , my general , say Peterloo . "
21794	21799	21800	21800	he	121	" Ay , Peterloo , "
21810	21814	21800	21800	he	121	" Easy conquests ! "
21815	21827	21828	21828	Lettie	116	" ' He came , he saw , he conquered , ' "
21831	21836	21837	21837	he	121	" Are you coming ? "
21844	21850	21851	21851	she	4146	" When you bid me , "
21956	21956	21957	21957	We	936	"
22201	22205	22207	22208	the father	465	" Now then , "
22212	22218	22207	22208	the father	465	" take that coat off , "
22223	22254	22256	22256	he	630	" Have you brought us a drink ? No ; come , that sounds bad ! Going a walk I guess . You see what it is to get fat , "
22285	22294	22296	22296	Lettie	116	" Show me , I 'll do some , "
22298	22301	22302	22302	he	630	" Nay , "
22306	22321	22322	22322	he	630	" it would scratch your wrists and break your stays . Hark at my hands "
22326	22330	22322	22322	he	630	" like sandpaper ! "
22353	22360	22361	22361	he	121	" That 's a fine movement ! "
22364	22367	22369	22370	the father	465	" Yes , "
22382	22407	22369	22370	the father	465	" and our George enjoys a bit o ' mowing . It puts you in fine condition when you get over the first stiffness . "
22577	22587	22571	22571	Leslie	121	" I should think mowing is a nice exercise . "
22588	22592	22593	22593	he	121	" It is , "
22606	22621	22600	22600	Leslie	121	" but it will make you sweat , and your hands will be sore . "
22638	22645	22622	22622	Leslie	121	" How do you do it ? "
22663	22668	22669	22669	she	116	" You are picturesque , "

22842	22852	22814	22814	he	964	" A bit but I 'm not dressed up . "
22853	22858	22859	22859	she	116	" Do you know , "
22863	22886	22859	22859	she	116	" your arms tempt me to touch them . They are such a fine brown colour , and they look so hard . "
22946	22954	22955	22955	she	116	" I wish I could work here , "
22984	22988	22989	22989	she	116	" I do ! "
22993	22999	23000	23000	he	108	" You feel so fine , "
23021	23043	23000	23000	he	108	" It 's a pleasure to work or to stand still . It 's a pleasure to yourself your own physique . "
23074	23077	23079	23079	he	108	" Jove , "
23081	23086	23079	23079	he	108	" I do perspire . "

23108	23118	23120	23120	he	108	" It 's a jolly nice form of exercise , "
23149	23157	23159	23159	Leslie	121	" What a hide you must have , "
23189	23196	23197	23197	he	465	" You 'd soon had enough , "

23311	23322	23308	23309	the father	465	" if you see the heads of the corn shake ! "

23786	23797	23783	23783	he	108	" Why did n't you fall on top of it ? "
23798	23803	23805	23805	I.	0	" I could n't , "

24450	24472	24438	24438	he	108	" makes you more tired than a whole day 's work . I do n't think I shall do it again . "
24473	24482	24484	24484	Leslie	121	" The sport 's exciting while it lasts , "
24486	24499	24501	24502	Mrs. Saxton	131	" It does you more harm than the rabbits do us good , "
24504	24514	24516	24517	her son	1005	" Oh , I do n't know , mother , "
24519	24527	24516	24517	her son	1005	" it 's a couple of shillings . "
24528	24538	24501	24502	Mrs. Saxton	131	" And a couple of days off your life . "
24539	24544	24545	24545	he	1005	" What be that ! "

24681	24702	24703	24703	he	108	" It does make you mad , though , to touch the fur , and not be able to grab him "
24725	24731	24733	24733	Leslie	121	" I do n't know , "
24735	24747	24733	24733	Leslie	121	" When it comes to killing it goes against the stomach . "
24748	24754	24756	24756	George	108	" If you can run , "
24758	24781	24756	24756	George	108	" you should be able to run to death . When your blood 's up , you do n't hang half way . "
24782	24790	24792	24792	Lettie	116	" I think a man is horrible , "
24794	24820	24792	24792	Lettie	116	" who can tear the head off a little mite of a thing like a rabbit , after running it in torture over a field . "
24821	24832	24834	24834	Emily	109	" When he is nothing but a barbarian to begin with "
24836	24849	24851	24851	George	108	" If you began to run yourself you 'd be the same , "
24853	24861	24863	24863	Leslie	121	" Why , women are cruel enough , "
24871	24874	24875	24875	he	121	" Yes , "
24878	24886	24875	24875	he	121	" they 're cruel enough in their way "
24896	24899	24901	24901	George	108	" Well , "
24903	24923	24901	24901	George	108	" what 's the good finicking ! If you feel like doing a thing you 'd better do it . "
24924	24931	24933	24933	Emily	109	" Unless you have n't courage , "
24951	24954	24956	24956	Lettie	116	" But , "
24965	24993	24956	24956	Lettie	116	" Do n't you think it 's brutal , now that you do think is n't it degrading and mean to run the poor little things down ? "
24994	24999	25000	25000	he	108	" Perhaps it is , "
25003	25012	25000	25000	he	108	" but it was n't an hour ago . "
25013	25019	25020	25020	she	116	" You have no feeling , "
25075	25080	25064	25064	him	108	" The Ash Grove . "
25081	25091	25093	25093	Emily	109	" He does n't care a scrap for anything , "
25598	25606	25607	25607	he	121	" Were you running away from me ? "
25610	25613	25614	25614	she	116	" No , "
25617	25629	25614	25614	she	116	" I have been to fetch you a plum . Look ! "
25639	25647	25649	25649	he	121	" They are too pretty to eat ! "
25651	25658	25659	25659	she	116	" You have not tasted yet , "
25662	25665	25666	25666	he	121	" Come , "
25674	25683	25666	25666	he	121	" Let us go up to the water . "
25752	25771	25744	25744	her	116	" No let us be still it is all so still I love it best of all now . "
25857	25865	25850	25850	George	108	" I sowed the seeds of love . "
25915	25923	25909	25909	George	108	" The moon is going to rise . "
25924	25930	25932	25932	Lettie	116	" Let me get down , "
25984	25993	25995	25995	George	108	" I thought you were all four together , "
26005	26024	25998	25998	Lettie	116	" So we were . So we are five now . Is it there the moon will rise ? "
26025	26074	26076	26076	Emily	109	" Yes I like to see it come over the wood . It lifts slowly up to stare at you . I always think it wants to know something , and I always think I have something to answer , only I do n't know what it is , "
26199	26204	26206	26206	he	121	" Come along , dear "
26231	26236	26237	26237	she	109	" Do you know , "
26252	26268	26237	26237	she	109	" I feel as if I wanted to laugh , or dance something rather outrageous . "
26269	26276	26277	26277	Leslie	121	" Surely not like that now , "

26382	26413	26379	26379	she	109	" Polka ! a polka one can dance a polka when the grass is smooth and short even if there are some fallen leaves . Yes , yes how jolly ! "

26606	26618	26595	26595	she	116	" that was lovely . Do you come and dance now . "
26619	26624	26626	26626	he	121	" Not a polka , "
26642	26664	26595	26595	she	116	" But one can not dance anything else on wet grass , and through shuffling dead leaves . You , George ? "
26665	26671	26672	26672	he	121	" Emily says I jump , "

26898	26946	26948	26948	she	116	" It must be the moon . Now , is my hat straight ? Tell me now you 're not looking . Then put it level . Now then ! Why , your hands are quite cold , and mine so hot ! I feel so impish , "
26951	26989	26990	26990	She	116	" There now I 'm ready . Do you notice those little chrysanthemums trying to smell sadly ; when the old moon is laughing and winking through those boughs . What business have they with their sadness ! "
27003	27021	26990	26990	She	116	" There if they sigh they ask for sorrow I like things to wink and look wild . "
27474	27482	27484	27484	he	1080	" Are they not quails and manna ? "
27509	27517	27484	27484	he	1080	" Quails and manna in this wilderness ? "
27518	27525	27531	27531	he	1086	" They are , by Jove ! "
27578	27581	27583	27584	the squire	1080	" Well , "
27589	27614	27583	27584	the squire	1080	" you have the land for next to nothing next to nothing at a rent really absurd . Surely the little that the rabbits eat "
27615	27627	27629	27630	the farmer	1094	" It 's not a little come and look for yourself , "
27640	27646	27647	27647	he	1080	" What do you want ? "
27650	27657	27583	27584	the squire	1080	" Will you wire me off ? "
27663	27699	27583	27584	the squire	1080	" Wire is what does Halkett say so much per yard and it would come to what did Halkett tell me now ? but a large sum . No , I ca n't do it . "
27700	27710	27583	27584	the squire	1080	" Well , I ca n't live like this . "
27711	27760	27583	27584	the squire	1080	" Have another glass of whisky ? Yes , yes , I want another glass myself , and I ca n't drink alone so if I am to enjoy my glass . That 's it ! Now surely you exaggerate a little . It 's not so bad . "
27761	27774	27583	27584	the squire	1080	" I ca n't go on like it , I 'm sure . "
27775	27821	27583	27584	the squire	1080	" Well , we 'll see about compensation we 'll see . I 'll have a talk with Halkett , and I 'll come down and have a look at you . We all find a pinch somewhere it 's nothing but humanity 's heritage . "

As it is , we depend on the milk - round , and on the carting which I do for the council . You ca n't call it farming . We 're a miserable mixture of farmer , milkman , greengrocer , and carting contractor . It 's a shabby business . "

29338	29372	29191	29191	George	108	" Me ! What should I change for ? I 'm comfortable at home . As for my future , it can look after itself , so long as nobody depends on me . "

29397	29419	29391	29391	he	1145	" this is pulling the nipple out of your lips , and letting the milk run away sour . Look there ! "

29530	29536	29524	29524	he	1130	" Good - evenin ' ! "

30817	30877	30774	30774	they	1195	" No they did n't see me . I was dropping asleep when a rabbit rushed under the blanket , all of a shiver , and a whippet dog after it . I gave the whippet a punch in the neck , and he yelped off . The rabbit stopped with me quite a long time then it went . "
30878	30884	30808	30808	I.	1197	" How did you feel ? "
30885	30920	30774	30774	they	1195	" I did n't care . I do n't care much what happens just now . Father could get along without me , and mother has the children . I think I shall emigrate . "
30921	30928	30808	30808	I.	1197	" Why did n't you before ? "
30929	30975	30774	30774	they	1195	" Oh , I do n't know . There are a lot of little comforts and interests at home that one would miss . Besides , you feel somebody in your own countryside , and you 're nothing in a foreign part , I expect . "
30976	30982	30808	30808	I.	1197	" But you 're going ? "
30983	31068	30774	30774	they	1195	" What is there to stop here for ? The valley is all running wild and unprofitable . You 've no freedom for thinking of what the other folks think of you , and everything round you keeps the same , and so you ca n't change yourself because everything you look at brings up the same old feeling , and stops you from feeling fresh things . And what is there that 's worth anything ? What 's worth having in my life ? "
31069	31073	31075	31075	I	0	" I thought , "
31077	31084	31075	31075	I	0	" your comfort was worth having . "

31107	31231	30774	30774	they	1195	" I do n't know . I 've not felt the same since that row with Annable . And Lettie said to me : ' Here , you ca n't live as you like in any way or circumstance . You 're like a bit out of those coloured marble mosaics in the hall , you have to fit in your own set , fit into your own pattern , because you 're put there from the first . But you do n't want to be like a fixed bit of a mosaic you want to fuse into life , and melt and mix with the rest of folk , to have some things burned out of you ' She was downright serious . "
31232	31247	30774	30774	they	1195	" Well , you need not believe her . When did you see her ? "
31248	31333	30774	30774	they	1195	" She came down on Wednesday , when I was getting the apples in the morning . She climbed a tree with me , and there was a wind , that was why I was getting all the apples , and it rocked us , me right up at the top , she sitting half way down holding the basket . I asked her did n't she think that free kind of life was the best , and that was how she answered me . "
31334	31341	30774	30774	they	1195	" You should have contradicted her . "
31342	31358	30774	30774	they	1195	" It seemed true . I never thought of it being wrong , in fact . "
31359	31365	30774	30774	they	1195	" Come that sounds bad . "
31366	31394	30774	30774	they	1195	" No I thought she looked down on us on our way of life . I thought she meant I was like a toad in a hole . "
31395	31403	30774	30774	they	1195	" You should have shown her different . "
31404	31415	30774	30774	they	1195	" How could I when I could see no different ? "
31416	31425	30774	30774	they	1195	" It strikes me you 're in love . "
31434	31457	31426	31426	He	1199	" No , but it is rotten to find that there is n't a single thing you have to be proud of . "
31458	31467	31426	31426	He	1199	" This is a new tune for you . "
31474	31483	30774	30774	they	1195	" And when do you think of going ? "
31484	31507	31426	31426	He	1199	" Oh I do n't know I 've said nothing to mother . Not yet , at any rate not till spring . "
31508	31515	31517	31517	I.	1200	" Not till something has happened , "
31518	31521	31522	31522	he	1199	" What ? "
31525	31529	31426	31426	He	1199	" Something decisive . "
31530	31545	31426	31426	He	1199	" I do n't know what can happen unless the Squire turns us out . "

"
37036	37045	36852	36852	Marie	114	" Do you want them for the bazaar ? "
37046	37077	36920	36920	She	114	" Yes for to - morrow . Cook has done the rest , but I had fairly set my heart on these . Do n't you think they are lovely ? "

37314	37344	37313	37313	I.	1330	" There is nothing at home to do . Mother is reading , and Lettie is stitching . The weather disagrees with her , as it does with Leslie . "

37792	37797	37817	37817	she	116	" Immensely , thanks . "
37820	37839	37817	37817	she	116	" Yes , no doubt . You have the air of a man who has been enjoying himself . "
37840	37846	37817	37817	she	116	" How do you mean ? "
37847	37866	37817	37817	she	116	" A kind of guilty or shall I say embarrassed look . Do n't you notice it mother ? "

37876	37888	37889	37889	Lettie	116	" I suppose it means we may not ask him questions , "

37930	37962	37897	37897	He	1338	" Oh , we have sat at home desolate . ' Ever of thee I 'm fo - o - ondly dreeaming ' and so on . Have n't we mother ? "

37970	37986	37968	37968	mother	4146	" I do n't know . We imagined him all sorts of lions up there . "
37987	38005	38007	38007	Lettie	116	" What a shame we may not ask him to roar his old roars over for us , "
38009	38015	38016	38016	he	1338	" What are they like ? "
38019	38044	37968	37968	mother	4146	" How should I know ? Like a sucking dove , to judge from your present voice . ' A monstrous little voice . ' "
38061	38104	38049	38049	She	116	" Pussy cat , Pussy cat , where have you been ? I 've been up to London to see the fine queen : Pussy cat , Pussy cat , what did you there I frightened a little mouse under a stair . "
38105	38109	38110	38110	she	116	" I suppose , "
38113	38140	38110	38110	she	116	" that may be so . Poor mouse ! but I guess she 's none the worse . You did not see the queen , though ? "
38141	38148	38149	38149	he	1340	" She was not in London , "
38153	38157	38158	38158	she	116	" You do n't "
38169	38186	38158	38158	she	116	" I suppose you do n't mean by that , she was in Eberwich your queen ? "
38187	38196	38197	38197	he	1340	" I do n't know where she was , "
38201	38204	38205	38205	she	116	" Oh ! "
38211	38228	38205	38205	she	116	" I thought perhaps you had met her in Eberwich . When did you come back ? "
38229	38233	38234	38234	he	1340	" Last night , "
38237	38249	38158	38158	she	116	" Oh why did n't you come and see us before ? "
38250	38260	38205	38205	she	116	" I 've been at the offices all day . "
38261	38269	38270	38270	she	116	" I 've been up to Eberwich , "
38274	38278	38324	38324	she	116	" Have you ? "
38279	38307	38324	38324	she	116	" Yes . And I feel so cross because of it . I thought I might see you . I felt as if you were at home . "
38328	38361	38362	38362	She	116	" Yes I felt you had come back . It is funny how one has a feeling occasionally that someone is near ; when it is someone one has a sympathy with . "
38389	38400	38368	38368	she	116	" I thought I might meet you when I was out "
38415	38421	38368	38368	she	116	" but I did n't . "
38422	38432	38433	38433	he	1340	" I was at the office till rather late , "
38464	38469	38444	38444	She	116	" You little liar . "
38508	38524	38525	38525	he	1340	" I did not know you wanted me for the pleasure of plucking this crow , "
38528	38533	38534	38534	she	116	" I wanted you ! "
38544	38551	38534	38534	she	116	" Who said I wanted you ? "
38552	38568	38582	38582	she	116	" No one . If you did n't want me I may as well go . "
38586	38595	38582	38582	she	116	" What made you think I wanted you ? "
38596	38613	38582	38582	she	116	" I do n't care a damn whether you wanted me or whether you did n't . "
38614	38640	38582	38582	she	116	" It seems to upset you ! And do n't use bad language . It is the privilege of those near and dear to one . "
38641	38652	38582	38582	she	116	" That 's why you begin it , I suppose . "
38653	38658	38659	38659	she	116	" I can not remember "
38667	38678	38663	38663	He	1342	" Well if you 're so beastly cut up about it "
38717	38725	38714	38714	he	1342	" Well you have we done then ? "
38773	38780	38770	38770	she	116	" I thought so this afternoon . "

39147	39151	39153	39153	Lettie	116	" There now ! "
39206	39218	39220	39220	Lettie	116	" Why has the old wretch settled just over our noses , "
39223	39233	39220	39220	Lettie	116	" Just to blot the promise of a sorrow . "
39234	39240	39241	39241	I	0	" Your 's or mine ? "
39244	39254	39220	39220	Lettie	116	" He is looking at me , I declare . "

39454	39498	39451	39451	I	0	" Oh , but she wept abundantly . I felt like weeping too , but somehow I laughed . She hoped he had gone to heaven but I 'm sick of that word ' but ' it is always tangling one 's thoughts . "

39508	39565	39451	39451	I	0	" Oh , she lifted up her forehead , and the tears dripped off her nose . He must have been an old nuisance , Syb . I ca n't understand why women marry such men . I felt downright glad to think of the drunken old wretch toppling into the canal out of the way . "
39705	39711	39714	39714	She	116	" Here comes your fourth , "

41195	41203	40993	40993	he	1353	" Oh , dear a sloppy angel ! "
41204	41221	41111	41111	She	1353	" Well do n't interrupt now suppose I were one like the ' Blessed Damosel . ' "

41270	41289	40993	40993	he	1353	" What on earth do you ask that for ? Oh I think I 'd be cursing eh ? "
41290	41302	41111	41111	She	1353	" No saying fragrant prayers that your thin soul might mount up "
41303	41365	40993	40993	he	1353	" Hang thin souls , Lettie ! I 'm not one of your souly sort . I ca n't stand Pre - Raphaelities . You You 're not a Burne - Jonesess you 're an Albert Moore . I think there 's more in the warm touch of a soft body than in a prayer . I 'll pray with kisses . "

41823	41842	41111	41111	She	1353	" What are you making so many words about ? You do n't know now , do you ? "
41843	41850	41111	41111	She	1353	" No that I do n't . "
41851	41866	41111	41111	She	1353	" Then just be comfortable . Let me look at myself in your eyes . "
41867	41896	41111	41111	She	1353	" Narcissus , Narcissus ! Do you see yourself well ? Does the image flatter you ? Or is it a troubled stream , distorting your fair lineaments . "

49918	49927	49894	49894	he	121	" So do I. You promised me something . "
49928	49931	49932	49932	she	116	" What ? "
49935	49943	49944	49944	he	121	" Here see if you like it , "

50026	50037	50023	50023	she	116	" Do you think they will come to my party ? "
50038	50045	50023	50023	she	116	" I hope not By Heaven ! "
50046	50058	50023	50023	she	116	" But oh , yes ! We have made all preparations . "
50059	50073	50023	50023	she	116	" What does that matter ! Ten thousand folks here to - day ! "
50074	50093	50023	50023	she	116	" Not ten thousand only five or six . I shall be wild if they ca n't come . "
50094	50099	50023	50023	she	116	" You want them ? "
50100	50121	50023	50023	she	116	" We have asked them and everything is ready and I do want us to have a party one day . "
50122	50133	50023	50023	she	116	" But to - day damn it all , Lettie ! "
50134	50153	50023	50023	she	116	" But I did want my party to - day . Do n't you think they 'll come ? "
50154	50164	50023	50023	she	116	" They wo n't if they 've any sense ! "
50165	50170	50171	50171	she	1528	" You might help me "
50174	50196	50023	50023	she	116	" Well I 'll be ! and you 've set your mind on having a houseful of people to - day ? "
50197	50227	50023	50023	she	116	" You know how we look forward to it my party . At any rate I know Tom Smith will come and I 'm almost sure Emily Saxton will . "
50239	50253	50228	50228	He	1529	" Then I suppose I 'd better send John round for the lot . "
50254	50265	50023	50023	she	116	" It would n't be much trouble , would it ? "
50266	50272	50228	50228	He	1529	" No trouble at all . "
50273	50278	50279	50279	she	1528	" Do you know , "
50289	50316	50279	50279	she	1528	" It makes me feel as if I tied something round my finger to remember by . It somehow remains in my consciousness all the time . "
50317	50322	50324	50324	he	1529	" At any rate , "
50326	50332	50324	50324	he	1529	" I have got you . "
50352	50363	50364	50364	she	116	" It is pretty , mother , is n't it ? "
50370	50382	50384	50385	my mother	515	" Yes , very pretty . I have always liked Leslie , "
50387	50405	50384	50384	my	0	" But it feels so heavy it fidgets me . I should like to take it off . "
50406	50426	50384	50385	my mother	515	" You are like me , I never could wear rings . I hated my wedding ring for months . "
50427	50433	50384	50384	my	0	" Did you , mother ? "
50434	50456	50384	50385	my mother	515	" I longed to take it off and put it away . But after a while I got used to it . "
50457	50468	50384	50384	my	0	" I 'm glad this is n't a wedding ring . "
50469	50477	50479	50479	I.	0	" Leslie says it is as good , "
50480	50491	50492	50492	She	515	" Ah well , yes ! But still it is different "
50517	50544	50509	50509	she	515	" I 'm glad it 's not not yet . I begin to feel a woman , little mother I feel grown up to - day . "
50557	50567	50568	50568	she	515	" Let me kiss my girl good - bye , "
50616	50623	50598	50598	she	515	" No , mother no o ! "
50653	50810	50645	50645	Marie	114	" Oh , Lettie , he is in such a state of excitement , you never knew . He took me with him to buy it let me see it on . I think it 's awfully lovely . Here , let me help you to do your hair all in those little rolls it will look charming . You 've really got beautiful hair there 's so much life in it it 's a pity to twist it into a coil as you do . I wish my hair were a bit longer though really , it 's all the better for this fashion do n't you like it ? it 's ' so chic ' I think these little puffs are just fascinating it is rather long for them but it will look ravishing . Really , my eyes , and eyebrows , and eyelashes are my best features , do n't you think ? "
50857	50865	50866	50866	he	121	" What the Dickens is she doing ? "
50869	50872	50840	50840	he	121	" Dressing . "
50873	50892	50827	50827	Leslie	121	" Then we may keep on waiting . Is n't it a deuced nuisance , these people coming ? "
50893	50903	50840	50840	he	121	" Well , we generally have a good time . "
50904	50923	50827	50827	Leslie	121	" Oh it 's all very well we 're not in the same boat , you and me . "
50924	50927	50929	50929	I	0	" Fact , "
50932	50993	50827	50827	Leslie	121	" By Jove , Cyril , you do n't know what it is to be in love . I never thought I could n't ha ' believed I should be like it . All the time when it is n't at the top of your blood , it 's at the bottom : ' the Girl , the Girl . ' "
51000	51017	50994	50994	He	121	" It seems pressing you , pressing you on . Never leaves you alone a moment . "
51024	51045	50994	50994	He	121	" Then , all at once , you remember how she kissed you , and all your blood jumps afire . "
51063	51067	51068	51068	he	121	" You know , "
51071	51086	51068	51068	he	121	" I do n't think she feels for me as I do for her . "
51087	51094	51096	51096	I.	1541	" Would you want her to ? "
51097	51113	51096	51096	I.	1541	" I do n't know . Perhaps not but still I do n't think she feels "
51216	51221	51222	51222	he	121	" You are splendid ! "
51275	51281	51282	51282	he	121	" It looks all right ! "
51285	51289	51290	51290	she	1545	" Anything would , "
51293	51307	51258	51258	He	121	" What do they mean sapphires and diamonds for I do n't know ? "
51308	51337	51258	51258	He	121	" Nor do I. Blue for hope , because Speranza in ' Fairy Queen ' had a blue gown and diamonds for the crystalline clearness of my nature . "
51338	51357	51258	51258	He	121	" Its glitter and hardness , you mean You are a hard little mistress . But why Hope ? "
51358	51476	51258	51258	He	121	" Why ? No reason whatever , like most things . No , that 's not right . Hope ! Oh Blindfolded hugging a silly harp with no strings . I wonder why she did n't drop her harp framework over the edge of the globe , and take the handkerchief off her eyes , and have a look round ! But of course she was a woman and a man 's woman . Do you know I believe most women can sneak a look down their noses from underneath the handkerchief of hope they 've tied over their eyes . They could take the whole muffler off but they do n't do it , the dears . "
51477	51522	51258	51258	He	121	" I do n't believe you know what you 're talking about , and I 'm sure I do n't . Sapphires reminded me of your eyes and is n't it ' Blue that kept the faith ? ' I remember something about it . "
51523	51526	51528	51528	she	1546	" Here , "
51535	51553	51528	51528	she	1546	" you ought to wear it yourself , Faithful One , to keep me in constant mind . "
51554	51585	51258	51258	He	121	" Keep it on , keep it on . It holds you faster than that fair damsel tied to a tree in Millais ' picture I believe it 's Millais . "
51592	51610	51258	51258	He	121	" What a comparison ! Who 'll be the brave knight to rescue me discreetly from behind ? "
51611	51614	51615	51615	he	1547	" Ah , "
51618	51633	51615	51615	he	1547	" it does n't matter . You do n't want rescuing , do you ? "
51634	51638	51639	51639	she	1546	" Not yet , "
51818	51845	51803	51803	She	114	" I always love Woodside , it is restful there is something about it oh assuring really it comforts one I 've been reading Maxim Gorky . "
51846	51851	51853	51853	I.	0	" You should n't , "
51854	51898	51803	51803	She	114	" Dadda reads them but I do n't like them I shall read no more . I like Woodside it makes you feel really at home it soothes one like the old wood does . It seems right life is proper here not ulcery "
51899	51905	51907	51907	I.	0	" Just healthy living flesh , "
51908	51936	51803	51803	She	114	" No , I do n't mean that , because one feels oh , as if the world were old and good , not old and bad . "
51937	51946	51948	51948	I.	0	" Young , and undisciplined , and mad , "
51949	51994	51803	51803	She	114	" No but here , you , and Lettie , and Leslie , and me it is so nice for us , and it seems so natural and good . Woodside is so old , and so sweet and serene it does reassure one . "
51995	51998	52000	52000	I	0	" Yes , "
52002	52022	52000	52000	I	0	" we just live , nothing abnormal , nothing cruel and extravagant just natural like doves in a dovecote . "
52023	52034	51803	51803	She	114	" Oh ! doves ! they are so so mushy . "
52035	52071	52000	52000	I	0	" They are dear little birds , doves . You look like one yourself , with the black band round your neck . You a turtle - dove , and Lettie a wood - pigeon . "
52072	52111	52116	52116	her	1553	" Lettie is splendid , is n't she ? What a swing she has what a mastery ! I wish I had her strength she just marches straight through in the right way I think she 's fine . "
52174	52179	52180	52180	she	114	" It is lovely , "
52184	52196	52180	52180	she	114	" People must be ill when they write like Maxim Gorky . "
52197	52203	52205	52205	I.	0	" They live in town , "
52206	52224	52180	52180	she	114	" Yes but then look at Hardy life seems so terrible it is n't , is it ? "
52225	52251	52180	52180	she	114	" If you do n't feel it , it is n't if you do n't see it . I do n't see it for myself . "
52252	52260	52180	52180	she	114	" It 's lovely enough for heaven . "
52261	52280	52180	52180	she	114	" Eskimo 's heaven perhaps . And we 're the angels eh ? And I 'm an archangel . "
52281	52303	52180	52180	she	114	" No , you 're a vain , frivolous man . Is that ? What is that moving through the trees ? "
52304	52308	52310	52310	I.	0	" Somebody coming , "
52324	52331	52333	52333	Marie	114	" Does n't he walk funnily ? "
52447	52455	52456	52456	he	1556	" Well , Beardsall , old man , "
52459	52477	52456	52456	he	1556	" and how 's things ? God , I 'm not ' alf hot ! Fine idea though "
52486	52500	52501	52501	He	1556	" Ripping ! ai n't they ? I 've come like an Indian brave "

52524	52531	52532	52532	he	1556	" Could n't resist it though , "
52535	52553	52532	52532	he	1556	" Remember your party last year Girls turned up ? On the war - path , eh ? "
52630	52640	52641	52641	he	1556	" Lord , I skimmed here like a swallow ! "
52650	52738	52644	52644	I	0	" Never met a soul , though they 've had a snow - plough down the road . I saw the marks of a cart up the drive , so I guessed the Tempests were here . So Lettie 's put her nose in Tempest 's nosebag leaves nobody a chance , that some women have rum taste only they 're like ravens , they go for the gilding do n't blame 'em only it leaves nobody a chance . Madie Howitt 's coming , I suppose ? "
52746	52751	52752	52752	he	1559	" She 'll come , "
52755	52771	52752	52752	he	1559	" if it 's up to the neck . Her mother saw me go past . "
52801	52829	52830	52830	he	1559	" Miss Gall I smell sulphur ! Beardsall , old boy , there 's fun in the wind . Madie , and the coy little Tempest , and "
52856	52875	52876	52876	he	1559	" Little pink of a girl worked it for me a real juicy little peach chipped somehow or other "
52991	53039	53071	53071	Marie	114	" Could n't forget to - day , Lettie . Would n't have let old Pluto and all the bunch of 'em keep me away . I skimmed here like a ' Brra - ave ' on my snow - shoes , like Hiawatha coming to Minnehaha . "
53040	53046	53048	53048	Marie	114	" Ah that was famine , "
53051	53065	53066	53066	he	1559	" And this is a feast , a gorgeous feast , Miss Tempest , "
53076	53083	53085	53085	mother	4146	" You have brought some music ? "
53087	53093	53094	53094	he	1559	" Wish I was Orpheus , "
53115	53135	53106	53106	he	1559	" I see you 're in full feather , Tempest . Is she kind as she is fair ? ' "
53136	53139	53106	53106	he	1559	" Who ? "
53168	53174	53176	53176	William	183	" She 's an houri ! "
53178	53205	53176	53176	William	183	" Gad , I 'm almost done for ! She 's a lotus - blossom ! But is that your ring she 's wearing , Tempest ? "
53206	53210	53212	53212	Leslie	121	" Keep off , "
53214	53222	53224	53224	I.	0	" And do n't be a fool , "
53225	53234	53236	53236	Will	244	" Oh , O - O - Oh ! "

53611	53615	53617	53617	Madie	238	" You know , "
53619	53647	53617	53617	Madie	238	" It gave me quite a flutter when I heard the piano . It is a year since I saw you . How did you get here ? "
53648	53656	53658	53658	he	244	" I came on snow - shoes , "

58315	58337	58261	58261	Marie	114	" Thanks but give me some of that stuff in brown jelly , will you ? It 's new to me . "
58338	58347	58261	58261	Marie	114	" Have some of this trifle , Georgie ? "
58348	58356	58261	58261	Marie	114	" I will you are a jewel . "
58357	58367	58261	58261	Marie	114	" So will you be a yellow topaz tomorrow ! "
58368	58375	58261	58261	Marie	114	" Ah ! tomorrow 's tomorrow ! "
58384	58410	58381	58381	Alice	218	" Georgie , dear have you finished ? do n't die the death of a king King John I ca n't spare you , pet . "
58411	58419	58261	58261	Marie	114	" Are you so fond of me ? "
58420	58443	58381	58381	Alice	218	" I am Aw ! I 'd throw my best Sunday hat under a milk - cart for you , I would ! "
58444	58462	58261	58261	Marie	114	" No ; throw yourself into the milk - cart some Sunday , when I 'm driving . "
58463	58470	58472	58472	Emily	109	" Yes come and see us , "
58474	58511	58261	58261	Marie	114	" How nice ! Tomorrow you wo n't want me , Georgie dear , so I 'll come . Do n't you wish Pa would make Tono - Bungay ? Would n't you marry me then ? "
58512	58516	58518	58518	he	1619	" I would , "
58591	58594	58596	58596	George	108	" Well , "
58602	58630	58596	58596	George	108	" To - day is nearly gone it will soon be tomorrow . I feel a bit drunk ! We had a good time to - night . "
58631	58636	58638	58638	Lettie	116	" I am glad , "
58659	58664	58666	58666	George	108	" We must go , "
58668	58681	58682	58682	he	108	" before the clock strikes , like Cinderella look at my glass slippers "
58688	58722	58682	58682	he	108	" Midnight , and rags , and fleeing . Very appropriate . I shall call myself Cinderella who would n't fit . I believe I 'm a bit drunk the world looks funny . "
58736	58747	58723	58723	We	1621	" Good - bye , Lettie ; good - bye . "
58768	58773	58774	58774	he	108	" Good - bye , "
58955	58967	58969	58969	Marie	114	" Leslie , Leslie , John is here , come along ! "
58976	58985	59011	59011	he	108	" Leslie John is waiting in the snow . "
58986	58990	59032	59032	She	116	" All right . "
58991	58999	59000	59000	She	114	" But you must come at once . "
59613	59616	59618	59618	she	116	" So ! "
59629	59670	59618	59618	she	116	" There now , you understand , do n't you , Minnehaha , my Laughing Water So laugh again , darling , and do n't worry about these things . We will not talk about them any more , eh ? "
59671	59675	59618	59618	she	116	" No more . "
59676	59720	59618	59618	she	116	" No more that 's right you are as wise as an angel . Come here pooh , the wood is thick and lonely ! Look , there is nobody in the world but us , and you are my heaven and earth ! "
59721	59725	59618	59618	she	116	" And hell ? "
59726	59754	59618	59618	she	116	" Ah if you are so cold how cold you are ! it gives me little shivers when you look so and I am always hot Lettie ! "
59755	59758	59618	59618	she	116	" Well ? "
59759	59786	59618	59618	she	116	" You are cruel ! Kiss me now No , I do n't want your cheek kiss me yourself . Why do n't you say something ? "
59787	59806	59618	59618	she	116	" What for ? What 's the use of saying anything when there 's nothing immediate to say ? "
59807	59812	59618	59618	she	116	" You are offended ! "
59813	59822	59823	59823	she	1674	" It feels like snow to - day , "
60194	60205	60207	60207	Lettie	116	" Get me some of those alder catkins , Leslie , "
60217	60248	60249	60249	She	116	" Yes , those , where they hang over the brook . They are ruddy like new blood freshening under the skin . Look , tassels of crimson and gold ! "
60272	60276	60265	60265	she	116	" A Birthday . "
60277	60289	60290	60290	she	116	" I 'm glad you came to take me a walk , "
60292	60336	60265	60265	she	116	" Does n't Strelley Mill look pretty ? Like a group of orange and scarlet fungi in a fairy picture . Do you know , I have n't been , no , not for quite a long time . Shall we call now ? "
60337	60363	60265	60265	she	116	" The daylight will be gone if we do . It is half past five more ! I saw him the son the other morning . "
60364	60367	60265	60265	she	116	" Where ? "
60368	60378	60265	60265	she	116	" He was carting manure I made haste by . "
60379	60391	60265	60265	she	116	" Did he speak to you did you look at him ? "
60392	60429	60265	60265	she	116	" No , he said nothing . I glanced at him he 's just the same , brick colour stolid . Mind that stone it rocks . I 'm glad you 've got strong boots on . "
60430	60437	60265	60265	she	116	" Seeing that I usually wear them "
60462	60473	60474	60474	she	1688	" You wo n't call and see them , then ? "
60477	60492	60493	60493	he	1690	" No . I like to hear the brook tinkling , do n't you ? "
60496	60506	60555	60555	I.	0	" Ah , yes it 's full of music . "
60507	60513	60514	60514	he	1690	" Shall we go on ? "
60521	60530	60555	60555	I.	0	" I 'll catch up in a minute , "
60546	60553	60555	60555	I.	0	" Come out for a walk , "
60556	60566	60567	60567	She	109	" Now ? Let me tell mother I was longing "
60597	60603	60604	60604	I	0	" I 'll come back , "
60892	60905	60907	60907	Leslie	121	" Let us go right into the wood out of the quarry , "
60909	60921	60907	60907	Leslie	121	" I have not been since I was a little lad . "
60922	60927	60929	60929	Emily	109	" It is trespassing , "
60931	60937	60938	60938	he	121	" We do n't trespass , "
61315	61325	61327	61327	Lettie	116	" What do they mean , do you think ? "
61349	61358	61360	61360	Leslie	121	" There are not so many this year , "
61362	61379	61381	61381	Emily	109	" They remind me of mistletoe , which is never ours , though we wear it , "
61385	61401	61402	61402	Lettie	116	" What do you think they say what do they make you think , Cyril ? "
61405	61440	61402	61402	Lettie	116	" I do n't know . Emily says they belong to some old wild lost religion . They were the symbol of tears , perhaps , to some strange hearted Druid folk before us . "
61441	61446	61448	61448	Lettie	116	" More than tears , "
61450	61478	61448	61448	Lettie	116	" More than tears , they are so still . Something out of an old religion , that we have lost . They make me feel afraid . "
61479	61487	61489	61489	Leslie	121	" What should you have to fear ? "
61491	61500	61501	61501	she	116	" If I knew I should n't fear , "
61504	61510	61501	61501	she	116	" Look at all the snowdrops "
61522	61588	61501	61501	she	116	" look at them closed up , retreating , powerless . They belong to some knowledge we have lost , that I have lost and that I need . I feel afraid . They seem like something in fate . Do you think , Cyril , we can lose things off the earth like mastodons , and those old monstrosities but things that matter wisdom ? "
61589	61596	61598	61598	I.	1723	" It is against my creed , "
61599	61607	61609	61609	she	116	" I believe I have lost something , "
61611	61614	61616	61616	Leslie	121	" Come , "
61618	61654	61616	61616	Leslie	121	" do n't trouble with fancies . Come with me to the bottom of this cup , and see how strange it will be , with the sky marked with branches like a filigree lid . "
61670	61680	61655	61655	She	116	" Ah , you are treading on the flowers . "
61681	61684	61686	61686	he	121	" No , "
61688	61695	61686	61686	he	121	" I am being very careful . "
61745	61753	61754	61754	he	121	" Do n't you care for me ? "
61758	61761	61762	61762	she	116	" You ? "
61774	61783	61784	61784	she	116	" You do not seem real to me , "
61807	61830	61804	61804	Birds	269	" off from the bushes , and Emily looked up with a great start as a quiet , sardonic voice said above us :
61831	61903	61804	61804	Birds	269	" A dove - cot , my eyes if it ai n't ! It struck me I ' eered a cooin ' , an ' ' ere 's th ' birds . Come on , sweethearts , it 's th ' wrong place for billin ' an ' cooin ' , in th ' middle o ' these ' ere snowdrops . Let 's ' ave yer names , come on . "
61904	61911	61913	61913	Leslie	121	" Clear off , you fool ! "
61967	62013	61957	61959	some malicious Pan	1729	" Very pretty pretty ! Two and two makes four . ' Tis true , two and two makes four . Come on , come on out o ' this ' ere bridal bed , an ' let 's ' ave a look at yer . "
62014	62025	62027	62027	Leslie	121	" Ca n't you use your eyes , you fool , "
62038	62050	62027	62027	Leslie	121	" At any rate you can see there are ladies here . "
62051	62079	61957	61959	some malicious Pan	1729	" Very sorry , Sir ! You ca n't tell a lady from a woman at this distance at dusk . Who may you be , Sir ? "
62080	62096	62027	62027	Leslie	121	" Clear out ! Come along , Lettie , you ca n't stay here now . "
62103	62135	62097	62097	They	1730	" Oh , very sorry , Mr. Tempest when yer look down on a man he never looks the same . I thought it was some young fools come here dallyin ' "
62136	62142	62144	62144	Leslie	121	" Damn you shut up ! "
62145	62159	62144	62144	Leslie	121	" I beg your pardon , Lettie . Will you have my arm ? "
62218	62230	62204	62204	he	1156	" Well , the lady might as well take her gloves . "
62248	62255	62242	62242	she	116	" Let me fetch my flowers . "
62277	62287	62289	62289	Annable	184	" Sorry I made such a mistake a lady ! "
62291	62316	62289	62289	Annable	184	" But I 've nearly forgot the sight o ' one save the squire 's daughters , who are never out o ' nights . "
62317	62335	62242	62242	she	116	" I should think you never have seen many unless ! Have you ever been a groom ? "
62336	62372	62289	62289	Annable	184	" No groom but a bridegroom , Sir , and then I think I 'd rather groom a horse than a lady , for I got well bit if you will excuse me , Sir . "
62373	62381	62242	62242	she	116	" And you deserved it no doubt . "
62382	62420	62289	62289	Annable	184	" I got it an ' I wish you better luck , Sir . One 's more a man here in th ' wood , though , than in my lady 's parlour , it strikes me . "
62421	62427	62429	62429	Leslie	121	" A lady 's parlour ! "
62440	62453	62289	62289	Annable	184	" Oh , yes ! ' Will you walk into my parlour ' "
62454	62463	62289	62289	Annable	184	" You 're very smart for a keeper . "
62464	62508	62289	62289	Annable	184	" Oh , yes Sir I was once a lady 's man . But I 'd rather watch th ' rabbits an ' th ' birds ; an ' it 's easier breeding brats in th ' Kennels than in th ' town . "
62509	62517	62519	62519	I.	1735	" They are yours , are they ? "
62520	62575	62289	62289	Annable	184	" You know 'em , do you , Sir ? Are n't they a lovely little litter ? are n't they a pretty bag o ' ferrets ? natural as weasels that 's what I said they should be bred up like a bunch o ' young foxes , to run as they would . "
62592	62604	62606	62606	I.	1735	" They 'll get nicely trapped , one of these days , "
62607	62621	62622	62622	he	1737	" They 're natural they can fend for themselves like wild beasts do , "
62627	62639	62642	62642	Leslie	121	" You are not doing your duty , it strikes me , "
62649	62698	62645	62646	The man	655	" Duties of parents ! tell me , I 've need of it . I 've nine that is eight , and one not far off . She breeds well , the ow'd lass one every two years nine in fourteen years done well , has n't she ? "
62699	62709	62645	62646	The man	655	" You 've done pretty badly , I think . "
62710	62771	62645	62646	The man	655	" I why ? It 's natural ! When a man 's more than nature he 's a devil . Be a good animal , says I , whether it 's man or woman . You , Sir , a good natural male animal ; the lady there a female un that 's proper as long as yer enjoy it . "
62772	62777	62645	62646	The man	655	" And what then ? "
62778	62859	62645	62646	The man	655	" Do as th ' animals do . I watch my brats I let 'em grow . They 're beauties , they are sound as a young ash pole , every one . They sha n't learn to dirty themselves wi ' smirking deviltry not if I can help it . They can be like birds , or weasels , or vipers , or squirrels , so long as they ai n't human rot , that 's what I say . "
62860	62870	62872	62872	Leslie	121	" It 's one way of looking at things , "
62874	62906	62907	62907	he	1739	" Ay . Look at the women looking at us . I 'm something between a bull and a couple of worms stuck together , I am . See that spink ! "
62917	62976	62907	62907	he	1739	" Pretty , is n't he ? What for ? And what for do you wear a fancy vest and twist your moustache , Sir ! What for , at the bottom ! Ha tell a woman not to come in a wood till she can look at natural things she might see something Good night , Sir . "
62984	62990	62992	62992	Leslie	121	" Coarse fellow , that , "
62999	63006	62992	62992	Leslie	121	" but he 's a character . "
63007	63013	63014	63014	she	116	" He makes you shudder , "
63017	63033	63014	63014	she	116	" But yet you are interested in him . I believe he has a history . "
63034	63041	63043	63043	Emily	109	" He seems to lack something , "
63045	63054	63056	63056	I.	109	" I thought him rather a fine fellow , "
63057	63067	63069	63069	Leslie	121	" Splendidly built fellow , but callous no soul , "
63075	63078	63080	63080	Emily	109	" No , "
63082	63090	63080	63080	Emily	109	" No soul and among the snowdrops . "
63164	63169	63171	63171	Lettie	116	" Let us run ! "
63204	63207	63199	63199	we	1741	" Hark ! "
63208	63212	63214	63214	Lettie	116	" A child ! "
63216	63221	63199	63199	we	1741	" At the Kennels , "

63775	63784	63786	63787	the mother	460	" I canna manage 'em , I canna , "
63790	63845	63786	63787	the mother	460	" They growin ' beyont me I dunna know what to do wi ' 'em . An ' niver a ' and does ' e lift ter ' elp me no ' e cares not a thing for me not a thing nowt but makes a mock an ' a sludge o ' me . "
63846	63851	63853	63853	Lettie	116	" Ah , baby ! "
63872	63885	63853	63853	Lettie	116	" do you want to walk to your mother go then Ah ! "
63945	63948	63949	63949	she	453	" Ah ! "

64207	64211	64213	64213	Lettie	116	" Is it ? "

64267	64277	64213	64213	Lettie	116	" And you would n't let Sam have it ? "

That was the root of the difference at first . But she cooled down , and if you do n't know the pride of my body you 'd never know my humiliation . I tried to remonstrate and she looked simply astounded at my cheek . I never got over that amazement .

Then I began to think of her , if she 'd have me but not clear , till you showed me those pictures . I must have her if I can and I must have something . It 's rather ghostish to have the road suddenly smudged out , and all the world anywhere , nowhere for you to go . I must get something sure soon , or else I feel as if I should fall from somewhere and hurt myself . I 'll ask her . "
77076	77082	77084	77084	I	0	" You 'll ask Lettie ? "

77534	77568	77500	77500	He	2163	" I do n't know . The same as she 's gone to Nottingham in , I suppose a sort of gold - brown costume with a rather tight fitting coat . Why ? "
77569	77578	77511	77511	I	0	" I was thinking how she 'd look . "
77579	77587	77588	77588	I	0	" What chickens are you counting now ? "
77591	77602	77603	77603	he	2163	" But what do you think I look best in ? "

77735	77739	77740	77740	he	2163	" Good Lord , "
77743	77834	77740	77740	he	2163	" I 've lain there thinking all afternoon . I did n't know I could do such a thing . Where have you been ? It 's with being all upset you see . You left the violets here , take them , will you ; and tell her : I 'll come when it 's getting dark . I feel like somebody else or else really like myself . I hope I sha n't wake up to the other things you know , like I am always before them . "
77835	77839	77875	77875	he	2166	" Why not ? "
77840	77870	77740	77740	he	2163	" Oh , I do n't know only I feel as if I could talk straight off without arranging like birds , without knowing what note is coming next . "
77878	77936	77875	77875	he	2166	" Here , leave me that book it 'll keep me like this I mean I 'm not the same as I was yesterday , and that book'll keep me like it . Perhaps it 's a bilious bout I do sometimes have one , if something very extraordinary happens . When it 's getting dark then ! "
78093	78114	78116	78116	she	116	" Look , Little Woman . I 've got a ready - made underskirt is n't it lovely . Listen ! "
78123	78154	78155	78155	She	116	" Sha n't I sound splendid ! Frou - Frou ! But it is a charming shade , is n't it , and not a bit bulky or clumsy anywhere ? "
78178	78266	78267	78267	She	116	" It 's just the right length , is n't it , Little Woman ? and they said I was tall it was a wonder . Do n't you wish it were yours , Little ? oh , you wo n't confess it . Yes you like to be as fine as anybody that 's why I bought you this piece of silk is n't it sweet , though ? you need n't say there 's too much lavender in it , there is not . Now ! "
78280	78343	78267	78267	She	116	" It suits you beautifully does n't it . Do n't you like it , Sweet ? You do n't seem to like it a bit , and I 'm sure it suits you makes you look ever so young . I wish you would n't be so old fashioned in your notions . You do like it , do n't you ? "
78344	78373	78155	78155	She	116	" Of course I do I was only thinking what an extravagant mortal you are when you begin to buy . You know you must n't keep on always "
78374	78470	78267	78267	She	116	" Now now , Sweet , do n't be naughty and preachey . It 's such a treat to go buying : You will come with me next time , wo n't you ? Oh , I have enjoyed it but I wished you were there Marie takes anything , she 's so easy to suit I like to have a good buy Oh , it was splendid ! and there 's lots more yet . Oh , did you see this cushion cover these are the colours I want for that room gold and amber "

78552	78563	78550	78550	mother	4146	" I told Rebecca to mash when you came in . "
78564	78594	78550	78550	mother	4146	" All right . Leslie 's coming up later on , I believe about half past eight , he said . Should I show him what I 've bought ? "

78607	78663	78550	78550	mother	4146	" I shall have to change my dress , and I 'm sure I do n't want the fag . Rebecca , just go and look at the things I 've bought in the other room and , Becky , fold them up for me , will you , and put them on my bed ? "
78675	78702	78672	78672	Lettie	116	" She 'll enjoy doing it , wo n't she , mother , they 're so nice ! Do you think I need dress , mother ? "

82084	82093	82251	82251	mother	4146	" Is it ? Then go somewhere nearer . "
82103	82112	82113	82113	she	116	" I do n't know what to do , "
82116	82176	82113	82113	she	116	" And I feel as if I might just as well never have lived at all as waste days like this . I wish we were n't buried in this dead little hole I wish we were near the town it 's hateful having to depend on about two or three folk for your your your pleasure in life . "
82177	82193	82251	82251	mother	4146	" I ca n't help it , my dear you must do something for yourself . "
82194	82206	82113	82113	she	116	" And what can I do ? I can do nothing . "
82207	82215	82251	82251	mother	4146	" Then I 'd go to bed . "
82216	82242	82113	82113	she	116	" That I wo n't with the dead weight of a wasted day on me . I feel as if I 'd do something desperate . "
82243	82249	82251	82251	mother	4146	" Very well , then , "
82253	82261	82251	82251	mother	4146	" do it , and have done . "
82262	82276	82277	82277	She	4146	" Oh , it 's no good talking to you I do n't want "

82641	82648	82631	82631	she	116	" You are trembling , dear . "
82649	82660	82631	82631	she	116	" It 's the ride . I 've never stopped . "
82671	82720	82664	82664	she	116	" How pale you are see , lie on the couch never mind the dust . All right , I 'll find you a coat of Cyril 's . O , mother , he 's come all those miles in the car without stopping make him lie down . "
82772	82793	82794	82794	he	121	" I wonder if I shall be had up for scorching I can feel the road coming at me yet , "
82797	82804	82845	82845	She	116	" Why were you so headlong ? "
82805	82844	82845	82845	She	116	" I felt as if I should go wild if I did n't come if I did n't rush . I did n't know how you might have taken me , Lettie when I said what I did . "
82862	82951	82845	82845	She	116	" It 's a wonder I have n't done something desperate I 've been half mad since I said Oh , Lettie , I was a damned fool and a wretch I could have torn myself in two . I 've done nothing but curse and rage at myself ever since . I feel as if I 'd just come up out of hell . You do n't know how thankful I am , Lettie , that you 've not oh turned against me for what I said . "
83048	83052	83053	83053	he	2234	" I suppose , "
83056	83070	83071	83071	he	2234	" I shall have to go home and get bathed and dressed though , "
83086	83105	83071	83071	he	2234	" I shall have to get back in the morning I do n't know what they 'll say . "
83106	83111	83112	83112	she	116	" At any rate , "
83115	83120	83112	83112	she	116	" You could wash here "
83121	83136	83071	83071	he	2234	" But I must get out of these clothes and I want a bath . "
83137	83166	83112	83112	she	116	" You could you might have some of Cyril 's clothes and the water 's hot . I know . At all events , you can stay to supper "
83167	83209	83071	83071	he	2234	" If I 'm going I shall have to go soon or they 'd not like it , if I go in late ; they have no idea I 've come ; they do n't expect me till next Monday or Tuesday "
83210	83222	83112	83112	she	116	" Perhaps you could stay here and they need n't know . "
83243	83259	83071	83071	he	2234	" Oh , but what would your mother think ! no , I 'll go . "
83260	83268	83304	83305	My mother	515	" She wo n't mind a bit . "
83269	83273	83071	83071	he	2234	" Oh , but "
83274	83280	83304	83305	My mother	515	" I 'll ask her . "
83315	83325	83307	83307	her	515	" He 'd better go home and be straight . "
83326	83369	83307	83307	her	515	" But look how he 'd feel he 'd have to tell them . . . and how would he feel ! It 's really my fault , in the end . Do n't be piggling and mean and Grundyish , Matouchka . "
83370	83377	83307	83307	her	515	" It is neither meanness nor grundyishness "
83378	83385	83387	83387	Lettie	116	" Oh , Ydgrun , Ydgrun ! "
83391	83400	83402	83402	mother	4146	" He may certainly stay if he likes , "
83411	83423	83431	83431	my	0	" All right , Mutterchen and be a sweetling , do ! "
83815	83824	83825	83825	he	2246	" I know I 'm a beastly nuisance , "
83828	83836	83825	83825	he	2246	" but I must get off early . "
83856	83894	83895	83895	I	0	" It 's a wonder Lettie has n't got up to have breakfast with you she 's such a one for raving about the perfection of the early morning it 's purity and promises and so forth , "

89644	89726	89573	89574	her father	486	" I 'm not going . What should I go for ? There 's nothing at the end of it only a long life . It 's like a day here in June a long work day , pleasant enough , and when it 's done you sleep well but it 's work and sleep and comfort , half a life . It 's not enough . What 's the odds ? I might as well be Flower , the mare . "
89736	89745	89746	89746	he	630	" Now it seems to me so different , "
89750	89787	89746	89746	he	630	" it seems to me you can live your own life , and be independent , and think as you like without being choked with harassments . I feel as if I could keep on like that "

89823	89891	89817	89817	he	630	" Do you know , I 'm going to get pretty rich , so that I can do what I want for a bit . I want to see what it 's like , to taste all sides to taste the towns . I want to know what I 've got in me . I 'll get rich or at least I 'll have a good try . "
89892	89901	89903	89903	Emily	109	" And pray how will you manage it ? "
89905	89917	89947	89947	he	465	" I 'll begin by marrying and then you 'll see . "
89922	89929	89918	89918	Emily	109	" Let us see you begin . "
89930	89938	89940	89941	the father	465	" Ah , you 're not wise ! "
89957	89978	89947	89947	he	465	" but he 'll come out there to me in a year or two you see if he does n't . "
89979	89987	89989	89989	I.	109	" I wish I could come now , "
89990	89995	89997	89997	George	108	" If you would , "

91862	92187	91844	91860	a garrulous spinster who had called ostensibly to inquire into the absence of the family from church	2460	" I said to Elizabeth , ' Now what a thing if anything happens to them just now , and the wedding is put off . ' I felt I must come and make myself sure that nothing had happened . We all feel so interested in Lettie just now . I 'm sure everybody is talking of her , she seems in the air . I really think we shall have thunder : I hope we sha n't . Yes , we are all so glad that Mr. Tempest is content with a wife from at home the others , his father and Mr. Robert and the rest they were none of them to be suited at home , though to be sure the wives they brought were nothing indeed they were not as many a one said Mrs. Robert was a paltry choice neither in looks or manner had she anything to boast of if her family was older than mine . Family was n't much to make up for what she lacked in other things , that I could easily have supplied her with ; and , oh , dear , what an object she is now , with her wisp of hair and her spectacles ! She for one has n't kept much of her youth . But when is the exact date , dear ? Some say this and some that , but as I always say , I never trust a ' they say . ' It is so nice that you have that cousin a canon to come down for the service , Mrs. Beardsall , and Sir Walter Houghton for the groom 's man ! What ? You do n't think so oh , but I know , dear , I know ; you do like to treasure up these secrets , do n't you ; you are greedy for all the good things just now . "
92240	92282	92223	92223	she	2463	" Oh , I hope nothing is wrong , dear I hope nothing is wrong ! I always feel so terrified of a telegram . You 'd better not open it yourself , dear do n't now let your brother go . "
92307	92313	92315	92315	Lettie	313	" It 's all right , "
92319	92332	92315	92315	Lettie	313	" it 's only to say he 's coming to - night . "
92333	92342	92344	92345	the spinster	2466	" I 'm very thankful , very thankful , "
92347	92403	92404	92404	she	2466	" It might have been so much worse . I 'm sure I never open a telegram without feeling as if I was opening a death - blow . I 'm so glad , dear ; it must have upset you . What news to take back to the village , supposing something had happened ! "
92612	92620	92622	92622	Lettie	313	" I will go round to Highclose , "
92624	92653	92622	92622	Lettie	313	" I am sure it will be stormy again . Are you coming down the road , Miss Slaighter , or do you mind if I leave you ? "

92682	92722	92622	92622	Lettie	313	" Oh , it will not come over for an hour , I am sure . We read the weather well out here , do n't we , Cyril ? You 'll come with me , wo n't you ? "
92901	92910	92911	92911	she	2475	" Put me in the stair - hole ! "
92914	92922	92911	92911	she	2475	" Where is the stair - hole ? "
93251	93254	93256	93256	Lettie	313	" Hark ! "
93494	93510	93491	93491	she	2505	" He is not dead let us take him home let us take him quickly . "
93573	93591	93548	93548	She	2505	" I ca n't bear to see his hand hanging , knocking against the bushes and things . "

94014	94019	94020	94020	he	313	" Yes perhaps so , "
94028	94122	94023	94023	his	313	" I would have had her she 'd have been glad if you 'd done as you wanted with her . She wo n't leave him till he 's strong , and he 'll marry her before then . You should have had the courage to risk yourself you 're always too careful of yourself and your own poor feelings you never could brace yourself up to a shower - bath of contempt and hard usage , so you 've saved your feelings and lost not much , I suppose you could n't .

94123	94125	94126	94126	he	2525	" But "
94139	94143	94144	94144	I	0	" Go on , "

94351	94362	94348	94348	she	2528	" it would be better for us not to marry ? "
94394	94401	94402	94402	he	2525	" Do you mean not yet ? "
94405	94414	94465	94465	He	2525	" Yes and , perhaps , perhaps never . "

101273	101352	101373	101373	she	109	" It 's casting its bread upon the winds no , it is dying , so it puts out all its strength and loads its boughs with the last fruit . It 'll be dead next year . If you 're here then , come and see . Look at the ivy , the suave smooth ivy , with its fingers in the trees ' throat . Trees know how to die , you see we do n't . "
101380	101407	101373	101373	she	109	" If we were trees with ivy instead of being fine humans with free active life we should hug our thinning lives , should n't we ? "
101408	101414	101373	101373	she	109	" I suppose we should . "
101415	101449	101373	101373	she	109	" You , for instance fancy your sacrificing yourself for the next generation that reminds you of Schopenhauer , does n't it ? for the next generation , or love , or anything ! "

101571	101618	101619	101619	she	109	" Cold he 's quite cold , under the feathers ! I think a wood - pigeon must enjoy being fought for and being won especially if the right one won . It would be a fine pleasure to see them fighting do n't you think ? "
101625	101637	101638	101638	he	313	" The claws are spread it fell dead off the perch , "
101641	101678	101742	101742	she	109	" Ah , poor thing it was wounded and sat and waited for death when the other had won . Do n't you think life is very cruel , George and love the cruellest of all ? "
101692	101714	101679	101679	He	313	" Let me bury him and have done with the beaten lover . But we 'll make him a pretty grave . "
101759	101762	101763	101763	she	109	" There , "

102063	102066	102067	102067	she	109	" No , "
102070	102089	102067	102067	she	109	" if I were , I would shape things oh , would n't I have my own way ! "
102090	102097	102131	102131	She	109	" And do n't you now ? "
102098	102130	102067	102067	she	109	" Oh I do n't want it particularly when I 've got it . When I 've had my way , I do want somebody to take it back from me . "
102188	102198	102199	102199	she	109	" I love to see myself in the water , "
102202	102244	102199	102199	she	109	" I do n't mean on the water , Narcissus but that 's how I should like to be out west , to have a little lake of my own , and swim with my limbs quite free in the water . "
102245	102251	102252	102252	he	2676	" Do you swim well ? "
102255	102258	102199	102199	she	109	" Fairly . "
102259	102269	102199	102199	she	109	" I would race you in your little lake . "

Look at the harvest of bluebells ripened for us ! Listen to the bee , sounding among all the organ - play if he sounded exultant for us ! "

It was running up so straight , with such a fine balance of leaves you know how a young strong sycamore looks about nine feet high it seemed a cruelty . When you are gone , and we are left from here , I shall feel like that , as if my leading shoot were broken off . You see , the tree is spoiled . Yet how it went on growing . I believe I shall grow faster . I can remember the bright red stalks of the leaves as he broke them off from the bough . "

112566	112574	112575	112575	I	0	" There is a tale about them , "
112585	112592	112594	112594	Hilda	339	" Pray , do tell us , "
112599	112908	112578	112579	The girls	496	" It was Emily told me she says it 's a legend , but I believe it 's only a tale . She says the peonies were brought from the Hall long since by a fellow of this place when it was a mill . He was brown and strong , and the daughter of the Hall , who was pale and fragile and young , loved him . When he went up to the Hall gardens to cut the yew hedges , she would hover round him in her white frock , and tell him tales of old days , in little snatches like a wren singing , till he thought she was a fairy who had bewitched him . He would stand and watch her , and one day , when she came near to him telling him a tale that set the tears swimming in her eyes , he took hold of her and kissed her and kept her . They used to tryst in the poplar spinney . She would come with her arms full of flowers , for she always kept to her fairy part . One morning she came early through the mists . He was out shooting . She wanted to take him unawares , like a fairy . Her arms were full of peonies . When she was moving beyond the trees he shot her , not knowing . She stumbled on , and sank down in their tryst place . He found her lying there among the red pyeenocks , white and fallen . He thought she was just lying talking to the red flowers , so he stood waiting . Then he went up , and bent over her , and found the flowers full of blood . It was he set the garden here with these pyeenocks . "
112931	112938	112940	112940	Lettie	313	" It is a beautiful ending , "
112952	112959	112961	112961	Leslie	121	" It 's all a tale , "
112999	113038	112991	112991	Marie	336	" Give me just a few and I can tell the others the story it is so sad I feel so sorry for him , it was so cruel for him ! And Lettie says it ends beautifully ! "
113077	113085	113087	113087	Lettie	313	" Good - bye for the present , "
113095	113100	113101	113101	he	313	" Good - bye , "
113104	113119	113121	113121	Marie	336	" Thank you so much for the flowers and the story it was splendid , "
113123	113128	113121	113121	Marie	336	" but so sad ! "
113190	113195	113196	113196	he	313	" And all day , "
113199	113244	113196	113196	he	313	" Blench has been ploughing his wheat in , because it was that bitten off by the rabbits it was no manner of use , so he 's ploughed it in : an ' they say with idylls , eating peaches in our close . "
113276	113296	113297	113297	He	313	" She said it ended well but what 's the good of death what 's the good of that ? "
113329	113334	113336	113336	I	0	" Damn that row ! "
113347	113388	113389	113389	Continuously	350	" It 's some stoat or weasel , or something . It 's been going on like that for nearly a week . I 've shot in the trees ever so many times . There were two one 's gone . "
113409	113413	113414	113414	he	313	" You know , "

113905	113941	113870	113870	I	0	" It 's all as one where you go , you will travel north , and I east , and Lettie south . Lettie has departed . In seven weeks I go . And you ? "
113942	113950	113951	113951	he	2949	" I must be gone before you , "
113955	113959	113961	113961	he	2949	" Do you know "
113967	113991	113992	113992	he	2949	" I feel alarmed at the idea of being left alone on a loose end . I must not be the last to leave "

114031	114056	114057	114057	he	2949	" You see it 's not so much what you call love . I do n't know . You see I built on Lettie , "
114069	114318	114057	114057	he	2949	" you must found your castles on something , and I founded mine on Lettie . You see , I 'm like plenty of folks , I have nothing definite to shape my life to . I put brick upon brick , as they come , and if the whole topples down in the end , it does . But you see , you and Lettie have made me conscious , and now I 'm at a dead loss . I have looked to marriage to set me busy on my house of life , something whole and complete , of which it will supply the design . I must marry or be in a lost lane . There are two people I could marry and Lettie 's gone . I love Meg just as well , as far as love goes . I 'm not sure I do n't feel better pleased at the idea of marrying her . You know I should always have been second to Lettie , and the best part of love is being made much of , being first and foremost in the whole world for somebody . And Meg 's easy and lovely . I can have her without trembling , she 's full of soothing and comfort . I can stroke her hair and pet her , and she looks up at me , full of trust and lovingness , and there is no flaw , all restfulness in one another "
114401	114408	114409	114409	he	313	" Well , are you ready ? "

120706	120738	120692	120692	George	313	" What I 've got 's in th ' road . Is'll ' ae ter get em out . I can manage wi ' bare gums , like a baby again . "
120739	120755	120756	120756	George	313	" Second childhood , eh ? Ah well , we must all come to it , "
120774	120785	120759	120761	The old man	663	" You'n got ter ower th ' first afore that . "
120805	120814	120815	120815	he	313	" I suppose you soon got over yours , "
120837	120895	120830	120830	He	663	" I 'd married , an ' paid for it ; I 'd broke a constable 's jaw an ' paid for it ; I 'd deserted from the army , an ' paid for that : I 'd had a bullet through my cheek in India atop of it all , by I was your age . "
120896	120899	120901	120901	George	313	" Oh ! "
120907	120917	120901	120901	George	313	" you 've seen a bit of life then ? "
120992	121001	121002	121002	George	313	" And how old are you , Dad ? "
121023	121036	121005	121006	The Parrot	359	" If you 'll be any better for knowing sixty - four . "
121037	121050	121052	121054	the young man	3195	" It 's a bit rough on you , is n't it , "
121056	121087	121052	121054	the young man	3195	" going round with the threshing machine and sleeping outdoors at that time of life ? I should ' a thought you 'd ' a wanted a bit o ' comfort "
121088	121100	121101	121102	the Parrot	3184	" How do you mean , ' rough on me ' ? "
121106	121117	121119	121119	George	313	" Oh , I think you know what I mean , "
121122	121130	121132	121135	the slow old Parrot	359	" Do n't know as I do , "
121137	121155	121132	121135	the slow old Parrot	359	" Well , you have n't made exactly a good thing out of life , have you ? "
121156	121187	121101	121102	the Parrot	3184	" What d'you mean by a good thing ? I 've had my life , an ' I 'm satisfied wi ' it . Is'll die with a full belly . "
121188	121198	121132	121135	the slow old Parrot	359	" Oh , so you have saved a bit ? "
121199	121202	121204	121206	the old man	663	" No , "
121209	121256	121204	121206	the old man	663	" I 've spent as I 've gone on . An ' I 've had all I wish for . But I pity the angels , when the Lord sets me before them like a book to read . Heaven wo n't be heaven just then . "
121257	121266	121268	121268	George	313	" You 're a philosopher in your way , "
121270	121274	121276	121278	the old man	663	" And you , "
121280	121311	121276	121278	the old man	663	" toddling about your back - yard , think yourself mighty wise . But your wisdom 'll go with your teeth . You 'll learn in time to say nothing . "
121334	121344	121346	121346	George	313	" There 's a lot in the old Parrot , "
121348	121355	121346	121346	George	313	" as he 'll never tell . "
121359	121379	121380	121380	he	663	" He makes you feel , as well , as if you 'd a lot to discover in life , "
121417	121420	121421	121421	George	313	" Ram . "
121886	121894	121878	121878	she	3220	" A Happy New Year to you . "
121904	121914	121915	121915	he	313	" I thought you would n't have known me , "
121918	121926	121928	121928	Lettie	313	" What , is it you George ? "
121932	121943	121944	121944	she	3220	" Now , what a joke ! How are you ? "
121961	121969	121954	121954	He	313	" I am very well and you ? "
121986	121991	121992	121992	she	3220	" As you see , "
122000	122007	121992	121992	she	3220	" but where are you going ? "
122008	122014	122015	122015	he	313	" I am going home , "
122023	122033	122015	122015	he	313	" have you forgotten that I too am married ? "
122034	122040	122042	122042	Lettie	313	" Oh , of course ! "
122044	122086	122042	122042	Lettie	313	" You are now mine host of the Ram . You must tell me about it . May I ask him to come home with us for an hour , mother ? It is New Year 's Eve , you know . "
122087	122094	122096	122096	mother	4146	" You have asked him already , "
122098	122108	122110	122110	Lettie	313	" Will Mrs. Saxton spare you for so long ? "
122114	122128	122042	122042	Lettie	313	" Meg ? Oh , she does not order my comings and goings . "
122129	122134	122136	122136	Lettie	313	" Does she not ? "
122138	122204	122136	122136	Lettie	313	" She is very unwise . Train up a husband in the way he should go , and in after life . I never could quote a text from end to end . I am full of beginnings , but as for a finish ! Leslie , my shoe - lace is untied shall I wait till I can put my foot on the fence ? "
122603	122614	122615	122615	she	3228	" Wo n't you take off my shoes , darling ? "
122641	122650	122651	122651	she	3228	" My feet are a tiny bit cold , "
122680	122686	122687	122687	he	121	" It is quite cold , "
122700	122707	122708	122708	she	3228	" Ah , you dear boy ! "
122721	122736	122737	122737	she	3228	" Is it great fun being mine host of ' Ye Ramme Inne ? ' "
122771	122776	122777	122777	he	121	" It is rather , "
122780	122801	122777	122777	he	121	" the men in the smoke room say such rum things . My word , you hear some tales there . "
122802	122808	122809	122809	she	3228	" Tell us , do ! "
122812	122832	122777	122777	he	121	" Oh ! I could n't . I never could tell a tale , and even if I could well "
122833	122841	122842	122842	she	3228	" But I do long to hear , "
122845	122866	122842	122842	she	3228	" what the men say in the smoke room of ' Ye Ramme Inne . ' Is it quite untellable ? "
122867	122870	122871	122871	he	121	" Quite ! "
122874	122937	122777	122777	he	121	" What a pity ! See what a cruel thing it is to be a woman , Leslie : we never know what men say in smoke rooms , while you read in your novels everything a woman ever uttered . It is a shame ! George , you are a wretch , you should tell me . I do envy you . "
122938	122947	122948	122948	he	121	" What do you envy me , exactly ? "
122957	122976	122777	122777	he	121	" Your smoke room . The way you see life or the way you hear it , rather . "
122977	122992	122993	122993	he	121	" But I should have thought you saw life ten times more than me , "
122996	123035	122777	122777	he	121	" I ! I only see manners good manners and bad manners . You know ' manners maketh a man . ' That 's when a woman 's there . But you wait awhile , you 'll see . "
123036	123042	123044	123044	George	313	" When shall I see ? "
123050	123061	123062	123062	she	3239	" When you have made the fortune you talked about , "
123077	123086	123087	123087	he	121	" But when I have made it when ! "
123091	123113	123087	123087	he	121	" even then well , I shall only be , or have been , landlord of ' Ye Ramme Inne . ' "
123132	123167	123121	123121	her	3239	" Oh , that does n't matter ! Leslie might be landlord of some Ram Inn when he 's at home , for all anybody would know might n't you , hubby , dear ? "
123168	123171	123173	123173	Leslie	121	" Thanks ! "
123180	123198	123199	123199	she	3239	" You ca n't tell a publican from a peer , if he 's a rich publican , "
123202	123211	123199	123199	she	3239	" Money maketh the man , you know . "
123212	123216	123218	123218	George	313	" Plus manners , "
123222	123269	123199	123199	she	3239	" Oh they are always there where I am . I give you ten years . At the end of that time you must invite us to your swell place say the Hall at Eberwich and we will come ' with all our numerous array . ' "
123307	123312	123313	123313	she	3239	" How is Meg ? "
123316	123329	123313	123313	she	3239	" Is she as charming as ever or have you spoiled her ? "
123330	123340	123341	123341	he	313	" Oh , she is as charming as ever , "
123344	123354	123341	123341	he	313	" And we are tremendously fond of one another . "
123355	123367	123368	123368	she	3239	" That is right ! I do think men are delightful , "
123373	123381	123382	123382	he	313	" I am glad you think so , "
123430	123445	123446	123446	she	3239	" Not until you have eaten a biscuit and drunk good luck with me , "
123477	123483	123485	123485	Lettie	313	" To the Vita Nuova ! "
123492	123495	123497	123497	George	313	" Hark ! "
123499	123503	123497	123497	George	313	" the hooters . "
123871	123888	123890	123890	Leslie	121	" Why , my darling , you should n't have troubled to come down so early , "
123897	123906	123907	123907	she	3250	" Of course , I should come down , "
123929	123982	123983	123983	She	3250	" I should not let you go away into the cold without having seen you take a good breakfast . I think it is thawing . The snow on the rhododendrons looks sodden and drooping . Ah , well , we can keep out the dismal of the morning for another hour . "
123988	123993	123994	123994	she	3250	" just an hour ! "
124027	124038	124039	124039	he	121	" I think I shall come back to - night , "
124075	124086	124087	124087	she	3250	" You will not do anything so foolish , Leslie , "
124108	124119	124120	124120	he	121	" I can easily catch the 7:15 from St. Pancras , "
124127	124136	124137	124137	she	3250	" Have I sweetened to your liking Cyril ? "
124151	124212	124148	124148	she	3250	" It is ridiculous Leslie ! You catch the 7.15 and very probably miss the connection at Nottingham . You ca n't have the motor - car there , because of the roads . Besides , it is absurd to come toiling home in the cold slushy night when you may just as well stay in London and be comfortable . "
124213	124227	124228	124228	he	121	" At any rate I should get the 10.30 down to Lawton Hill , "
124231	124238	124239	124239	she	3250	" But there is no need , "
124242	124304	124239	124239	she	3250	" there is not the faintest need for you to come home to - night . It is really absurd of you . Think of all the discomfort ! Indeed I should not want to come trailing dismally home at midnight , I should not indeed . You would be simply wretched . Stay and have a jolly evening with Cyril . "
124324	124332	124333	124333	she	3250	" That is what you can do ! "
124336	124380	124333	124333	she	3250	" Go to the pantomime . Or wait go to Maeterlinck 's ' Blue Bird . ' I am sure that is on somewhere . I wonder if Rebecca has destroyed yesterday 's paper . Do you mind touching the bell , Cyril ? "
124471	124477	124478	124478	she	3250	" Good - bye dear ! "
124491	124545	124478	124478	she	3250	" You know it would have been miserable for you to sit all those hours in the train at night . You will have ever such a jolly time . I know you will . I shall look for you to - morrow . Good - bye , then , Good - bye ! "
124652	124657	124660	124660	her	3250	" Good - bye ! "
124669	124674	124675	124675	I	0	" Good - bye ! "
124680	124690	124691	124691	he	121	" Good - bye Darling , Good - bye ! "
125222	125381	125215	125215	Emily	109	" Do n't you find it quite exhilarating , almost intoxicating , to be so free ? I think it is quite wonderful . At home you can not live your own life . You have to struggle to keep even a little apart for yourself . It is so hard to stand aloof from our mothers , and yet they are only hurt and insulted if you tell them what is in your heart . It is such a relief not to have to be anything to anybody , but just to please yourself . I am sure mother and I have suffered a great deal from trying to keep up our old relations . Yet she would not let me go . When I come home in the evening and think that I need n't say anything to anybody , nor do anything for anybody , but just have the evening for myself , I am overjoyed .
125382	125390	125215	125215	Emily	109	" I have begun to write a story "
125400	125441	125397	125397	she	3290	" As I go to school by Old Brayford village in the morning the birds are thrilling wonderfully and everything seems stirring . Very likely there will be a set - back , and after that spring will come in truth .
125442	125506	125397	125397	she	3290	" When shall you come and see me ? I can not think of a spring without you . The railways are the only fine exciting things here one is only a few yards away from school . All day long I am watching the great Midland trains go south . They are very lucky to be able to rush southward through the sunshine .
125507	125601	125397	125397	she	3290	" The crows are very interesting . They flap past all the time we 're out in the yard . The railways and the crows make the charm of my life in Brayford . The other day I saw no end of pairs of crows . Do you remember what they say at home ? ' One for sorrow . ' Very often one solitary creature sits on the telegraph wires . I almost hate him when I look at him . I think my badge for life ought to be one crow . "
125608	125648	125397	125397	she	3290	" I have been home for the week - end . Is n't it nice to be made much of , to be an important cherished person for a little time ? It is quite a new experience for me .
125649	125747	125397	125397	she	3290	" The snowdrops are full out among the grass in the front garden and such a lot . I imagined you must come in the sunshine of the Sunday afternoon to see them . It did not seem possible you should not . The winter aconites are out along the hedge . I knelt and kissed them . I have been so glad to go away , to breathe the free air of life , but I felt as if I could not come away from the aconites . I have sent you some are they much withered ?
125748	125796	125397	125397	she	3290	" Now I am in my lodgings , I have the quite unusual feeling of being contented to stay here a little while not long not above a year , I am sure . But even to be contented for a little while is enough for me . "
125810	125935	125807	125808	the father	465	" You 'll not see us again in the old place . We shall be gone in a fortnight . The things are most of them gone already . George has got Bob and Flower . I have sold three of the cows , Stafford , and Julia and Hannah . The place looks very empty . I do n't like going past the cowsheds , and we miss hearing the horses stamp at night . But I shall not be sorry when we have really gone . I begin to feel as if we 'd stagnated here . I begin to feel as if I was settling and getting narrow and dull . It will be a new lease of life to get away .
125936	126100	125397	125397	she	3290	" But I 'm wondering how we shall be over there . Mrs. Saxton feels very nervous about going . But at the worst we can but come back . I feel as if I must go somewhere , it 's stagnation and starvation for us here . I wish George would come with me . I never thought he would have taken to public - house keeping , but he seems to like it all right . He was down with Meg on Sunday . Mrs. Saxton says he 's getting a public - house tone . He is certainly much livelier , more full of talk than he was . Meg and he seem very comfortable , I 'm glad to say . He 's got a good milk - round , and I 've no doubt but what he 'll do well . He is very cautious at the bottom ; he 'll never lose much if he never makes much .
126101	126199	125807	125808	the father	465	" Sam and David are very great friends . I 'm glad I 've got the boy . We often talk of you . It would be very lonely if it was n't for the excitement of selling things and so on . Mrs. Saxton hopes you will stick by George . She worries a bit about him , thinking he may go wrong . I do n't think he will ever go far . But I should be glad to know you were keeping friends . Mrs. Saxton says she will write to you about it . "
126226	126230	125807	125808	the father	465	" My Dear Cyril ,
126231	126378	125807	125808	the father	465	" Forgive me for not having written you before , but you see , I can not sit down and write to you any time . If I can not do it just when I am in the mood , I can not do it at all . And it so often happens that the mood comes upon me when I am in the fields at work , when it is impossible to write . Last night I sat by myself in the kitchen on purpose to write to you , and then I could not . All day , at Greymede , when I was drilling in the fallow at the back of the church , I had been thinking of you , and I could have written there if I had had materials , but I had not , and at night I could not .
126379	126491	125807	125808	the father	465	" I am sorry to say that in my last letter I did not thank you for the books . I have not read them both , but I have nearly finished Evelyn Innes . I get a bit tired of it towards the end . I do not do much reading now . There seems to be hardly any chance for me , either somebody is crying for me in the smoke room , or there is some business , or else Meg wo n't let me . She does n't like me to read at night , she says I ought to talk to her , so I have to .
126492	126782	125807	125808	the father	465	" It is half - past seven , and I am sitting ready dressed to go and talk to Harry Jackson about a young horse he wants to sell to me . He is in pretty low water , and it will make a pretty good horse . But I do n't care much whether I have it or not . The mood seized me to write to you . Somehow at the bottom I feel miserable and heavy , yet there is no need . I am making pretty good money , and I 've got all I want . But when I 've been ploughing and getting the oats in those fields on the hillside at the back of Greymede church , I 've felt as if I did n't care whether I got on or not . It 's very funny . Last week I made over five pounds clear , one way and another , and yet now I 'm as restless , and discontented as I can be , and I seem eager for something , but I do n't know what it is . Sometimes I wonder where I am going . Yesterday I watched broken white masses of cloud sailing across the sky in a fresh strong wind . They all seemed to be going somewhere . I wondered where the wind was blowing them . I do n't seem to have hold on anything , do I ? Can you tell me what I want at the bottom of my heart ? I wish you were here , then I think I should not feel like this . But generally I do n't , generally I am quite jolly , and busy .
126783	126804	125807	125808	the father	465	" By jove , here 's Harry Jackson come for me . I will finish this letter when I get back .
126805	126878	125807	125808	the father	465	" I have got back , we have turned out , but I can not finish . I can not tell you all about it . I 've had a little row with Meg . Oh , I 've had a rotten time . But I can not tell you about it to - night , it is late , and I am tired , and have a headache . Some other time perhaps
126882	126882	126879	126880	GEORGE SAXTON	108	"
127292	127432	127282	127282	Alice	218	" Cyril dear , prepare yourself . Meg has got twins yesterday . I went up to see how she was this afternoon , not knowing anything , and there I found a pair of bubs in the nest , and old ma Stainwright bossing the show . I nearly fainted . Sybil dear , I hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry when I saw those two rummy little round heads , like two larch cones cheek by cheek on a twig . One is a darkie , with lots of black hair , and the other is red , would you believe it , just lit up with thin red hair like a flicker of firelight . I gasped . I believe I did shed a few tears , though what for , I do n't know .
127433	127626	127282	127282	Alice	218	" The old grandma is a perfect old wretch over it . She lies chuckling and passing audible remarks in the next room , as pleased as punch really , but so mad because ma Stainwright would n't have them taken in to her . You should have heard her when we took them in at last . They are both boys . She did make a fuss , poor old woman . I think she 's going a bit funny in the head . She seemed sometimes to think they were hers , and you should have heard her , the way she talked to them , it made me feel quite funny . She wanted them lying against her on the pillow , so that she could feel them with her face . I shed a few more tears , Sybil . I think I must be going dotty also . But she came round when we took them away , and began to chuckle to herself , and talk about the things she 'd say to George when he came awful shocking things , Sybil , made me blush dreadfully .
127627	127745	127282	127282	Alice	218	" Georgie did n't know about it then . He was down at Bingham , buying some horses , I believe . He seems to have got a craze for buying horses . He got in with Harry Jackson and Mayhew 's sons you know , they were horse dealers at least their father was . You remember he died bankrupt about three years ago . There are Fred and Duncan left , and they pretend to keep on the old business . They are always up at the Ram , and Georgie is always driving about with them . I do n't like it they are a loose lot , rather common , and poor enough now .
127746	127860	127282	127282	Alice	218	" Well , I thought I 'd wait and see Georgie . He came about half - past five . Meg had been fidgeting about him , wondering where he was , and how he was , and so on . Bless me if I 'd worry and whittle about a man . The old grandma heard the cart , and before he could get down she shouted you know her room is in the front ' Hi , George , ma lad , sharpen thy shins an ' com ' an ' a'e a look at 'em thee'r 's two on 'em , two on 'em ! ' and she laughed something awful .
127861	127862	127282	127282	Alice	218	" "
127894	127904	127884	127884	Meg	114	" ' He 's been wi ' them Mayhews . "
127905	128033	127884	127884	Meg	114	" ' Tha 's gotten twins , a couple at a go ma lad ! ' shouted the old woman , and you know how she gives squeal before she laughs ! She made the horse shy , and he swore at it something awful . Then Bill took it , and Georgie came upstairs . I saw Meg seem to shrink when she heard him kick at the stairs as he came up , and she went white . When he got to the top he came in . He fairly reeked of whisky and horses . Bah , a man is hateful when he reeks of drink ! He stood by the side of the bed grinning like a fool , and saying , quite thick :
128034	128061	127884	127884	Meg	114	" ' You 've bin in a bit of a ' urry , ' aven't you Meg . An ' how are ter feelin ' then ? '
128062	128075	127884	127884	Meg	114	" ' Oh , I 'm a ' right , ' said Meg .
128076	128093	127884	127884	Meg	114	" ' Is it twins , straight ? ' he said , ' wheer is 'em ? '
128094	128154	127884	127884	Meg	114	" Meg looked over at the cradle , and he went round the bed to it , holding to the bed - rail . He had never kissed her , nor anything . When he saw the twins , asleep with their fists shut tight as wax , he gave a laugh as if he was amused , and said :
128155	128178	127884	127884	Meg	114	" ' Two right enough an ' one on 'em red ! Which is the girl , Meg , the black un ? '
128179	128192	127884	127884	Meg	114	" ' They 're both boys , ' said Meg , quite timidly .
128193	128203	127884	127884	Meg	114	" He turned round , and his eyes went little .
128204	128299	127884	127884	Meg	114	" ' Blast 'em then ! ' he said . He stood there looking like a devil . Sybil dear , I did not know our George could look like that . I thought he could only look like a faithful dog or a wounded stag . But he looked fiendish . He stood watching the poor little twins , scowling at them , till at last the little red one began to whine a bit . Ma Stainwright came pushing her fat carcass in front of him and bent over the baby , saying :
128300	128325	127884	127884	Meg	114	" ' Why , my pretty , what are they doin' to thee , what are they ? what are they doin' to thee ? '
128326	128355	127884	127884	Meg	114	" Georgie scowled blacker than ever , and went out , lurching against the wash - stand and making the pots rattle till my heart jumped in my throat .
128356	128404	127884	127884	Meg	114	" ' Well , if you do n't call that scandylos ! ' said old Ma Stainwright , and Meg began to cry . You do n't know , Cyril ! She sobbed fit to break her heart . I felt as if I could have killed him .
128405	128480	127884	127884	Meg	114	" That old gran'ma began talking to him , and he laughed at her . I do hate to hear a man laugh when he 's half drunk . It makes my blood boil all of a sudden . That old grandmother backs him up in everything , she 's a regular nuisance . Meg has cried to me before over the pair of them . The wicked , vulgar old thing that she is "
128795	128802	128803	128803	she	900	" Stop it , stop it ! "
128814	128826	128828	128828	she	900	" Silly little devils , fools , fools , fools ! ! "
128863	128908	128909	128909	she	900	" Do n't you like 'em , do n't you ? Well eat 'em , eat 'em then . Go on Emily , go on , eat some more . Only do n't tell Tom do n't tell Tom when ' e comes in , "
129043	129060	129062	129062	she	900	" Emily , he 's your sweetheart , your sweetheart Emily ! You never told me ! "
129087	129104	129106	129106	she	900	" You 've been here o ' nights , have n't you Emily have n't you ? "
129124	129129	129111	129111	she	900	" Ah , look there "
129137	129172	129111	129111	she	900	" Look at her , look at her ! How many kisses a night , Emily ? Ha ! Ha ! kisses all the year ! Kisses o ' nights in a lonely place . "
129380	129399	129376	129376	Meg	114	" No , do n't you take him Emily naughty little thing ! Let his father hold him ! "
129466	129473	129475	129475	Meg	114	" I ca n't shake hands , "
129480	129491	129493	129493	she	114	" I am all floury . Sit down , will you "
129522	129544	129500	129500	Emily	109	" See , I am engaged thus for a moment , but I keep my heart for you all the time . "
129723	129726	129728	129728	Teenie	369	" No , "
129730	129739	129728	129728	Teenie	369	" he 's not for sleep this day . "
129740	129758	129760	129760	Meg	114	" Mend the fire and see to the oven , and then put him his frock on , "
129808	129827	129802	129802	he	108	" Here , look at bun - bun ! Have your nice rabbit ! Hark at it squeaking ! "
129873	129900	129865	129865	He	108	" What 's up then ? What 's up wi ' thee ? Have a ride then dee - de - dee - de - dee ! "
129922	129928	129930	129930	George	108	" Hurry up , Teenie ! "
129996	130004	129979	129979	George	108	" Will you come in the garden ? "
130050	130054	130055	130055	he	108	" You know , "
130066	130066	130055	130055	he	108	"
130080	130083	130084	130084	he	108	" Yes ! "
130087	130139	130084	130084	he	108	" you know she ought to have sent the girl out with the kids this afternoon , and have got dressed directly . But no , she must sit gossiping with Emily all the time they were asleep , and then as soon as they wake up she begins to make cake "
130140	130155	130156	130156	I	0	" I suppose she felt she 'd enjoy a pleasant chat , all quiet , "
130159	130183	130084	130084	he	108	" But she knew quite well you were coming , and what it would be . But a woman 's no dam foresight . "
130184	130192	130194	130194	I.	0	" Nay , what does it matter ! "
130195	130217	130084	130084	he	108	" Sunday 's the only day we can have a bit of peace , so she might keep 'em quiet then . "
130218	130237	130238	130238	I	0	" I suppose it was the only time , too , that she could have a quiet gossip , "
130241	130248	130249	130249	he	3389	" But you do n't know , "
130252	130359	130249	130249	he	3389	" there seems to be never a minute of freedom . Teenie sleeps in now , and lives with us in the kitchen Oswald as well so I never know what it is to have a moment private . There does n't seem a single spot anywhere where I can sit quiet . It 's the kids all day , and the kids all night , and the servants , and then all the men in the house I sometimes feel as if I should like to get away . I shall leave the pub as soon as I can only Meg does n't want to . "
130360	130372	130084	130084	he	108	" But if you leave the public - house what then ? "
130373	130457	130249	130249	he	3389	" I should like to get back on a farm . This is no sort of a place , really , for farming . I 've always got some business on hand , there 's a traveller to see , or I 've got to go to the brewers , or I 've somebody to look at a horse , or something . Your life 's all messed up . If I had a place of my own , and farmed it in peace "
130458	130469	130470	130470	I	0	" You 'd be as miserable as you could be , "
130473	130477	130478	130478	he	3390	" Perhaps so , "
130487	130512	130482	130482	his	3390	" Perhaps so ! Anyhow , I need n't bother , for I feel as if I never shall go back to the land . "
130513	130528	130529	130529	I	0	" Which means at the bottom of your heart you do n't intend to , "
130533	130537	130538	130538	he	3390	" Perhaps so ! "
130542	130633	130538	130538	he	3390	" You see I 'm doing pretty well here apart from the public - house : I always think that 's Meg 's . Come and look in the stable . I 've got a shire mare and two nags : pretty good . I went down to Melton Mowbray with Tom Mayhew , to a chap they 've had dealings with . Tom 's all right , and he knows how to buy , but he is such a lazy careless devil , too lazy to be bothered to sell "
130673	130687	130663	130663	She	109	" See , now he is good ! Does n't he look pretty ? "
130724	130730	130731	130731	I	0	" Who is he like ? "
130767	130791	130764	130764	she	109	" Who is he ? Why , nobody , of course ! But he will be like father , do n't you think ? "
130822	130834	130840	130840	her	109	" Ay ! Blue eyes like your father 's not like yours "
130843	130846	130847	130847	she	109	" No ! "
130852	130874	130847	130847	she	109	" And I think he 'll be jolly , like father they have neither of them our eyes , have they ? "
130875	130878	130879	130879	I	0	" No , "
130891	130942	130879	130879	I	0	" No not vulnerable . To have such soft , vulnerable eyes as you used makes one feel nervous and irascible . But you have clothed over the sensitiveness of yours , have n't you ? like naked life , naked defenceless protoplasm they were , is it not so ? "
130975	130982	130984	130984	George	108	" And were mine like that ? "
131021	131024	131025	131025	I	0	" Yes , "
131028	131052	131025	131025	I	0	" yes but not so bad . You never gave yourself away so much you were most cautious : but just as defenceless . "
131053	131059	131060	131060	he	108	" And am I altered ? "
131078	131108	131069	131069	he	108	" Yes , more cautious . You keep in the shadow . But Emily has clothed herself , and can now walk among the crowd at her own gait . "
131144	131164	131138	131138	I	0	" But you are taking me to the stable George ! Come and see the horses too , Emily . "
131165	131175	131176	131176	she	3396	" I will . I admire them so much , "
131270	131277	131278	131278	she	109	" He is a little wanderer , "
131281	131299	131300	131300	she	109	" he likes to be always moving . Perhaps he objects to the ammonia of stables too , "
131308	131318	131300	131300	she	109	" it is not very agreeable , is it ? "
131319	131323	131324	131324	I	0	" Not particularly , "
131529	131532	131534	131534	Emily	109	" Look ! "
131536	131559	131560	131560	she	109	" look at the little bees ! Ah , but you must n't touch them , they bite . They 're coming ! "
131740	131752	131753	131753	she	109	" What , have you had that child all this time ? "
131760	131766	131753	131753	she	109	" Where is his father ? "
131767	131799	131801	131801	Emily	109	" I do n't know we left him in the stable , did n't we Cyril ? But I like nursing him , Meg . I like it ever so much , "
131803	131865	131753	131753	she	109	" Oh , yes , you may be sure George would get off it if he could . He 's always in the stable . As I tell him , he fair stinks of horses . He 's not that fond of the children , I can tell you . Come on , my pet why , come to its mammy . "
131896	131909	131911	131911	Meg	114	" Here , just look and tell George as tea is ready , "
131913	131918	131920	131920	Oswald	370	" Where is he ? "
131932	131940	131942	131942	Meg	114	" You know where to find him , "
131966	131974	131975	131975	he	108	" What , is it tea already ? "
131978	131995	131997	131997	Meg	114	" It 's a wonder you have n't been crying out for it this last hour , "
131999	132011	132012	132012	he	108	" It 's a marvel you 've got dressed so quick , "
132015	132021	132022	132022	she	114	" Oh , is it ? "
132024	132050	132051	132052	The maid	470	" well , it 's not with any of your help that I 've done it , that is a fact . Where 's Teenie ? "
132071	132085	132086	132086	she	470	" Can you take Alfy as well , just while we have tea ? "
132175	132186	132188	132188	Meg	114	" I do n't know what those cakes are like , "
132190	132238	132188	132188	Meg	114	" I made them in such a fluster . Really , you have to do things as best you can when you 've got children especially when there 's two . I never seem to have time to do my hair up even look at it now . "
132352	132370	132372	132372	Meg	114	" It 's a funny thing , but whenever anybody comes they 're sure to be cross , "
132378	132386	132388	132388	George	108	" They 're no different from ordinary , "
132390	132403	132388	132388	George	108	" it 's only that you 're forced to notice it then . "
132404	132411	132413	132413	Meg	114	" No , it is not ! "
132419	132492	132413	132413	Meg	114	" Is it now , Emily ? Of course , he has to say something ! Were n't they as good as gold this morning , Emily ? and yesterday ! why they never murmured , as good as gold they were . But he wants them to be as dumb as fishes : he 'd like them shutting up in a box as soon as they make a bit of noise . "
132493	132502	132503	132503	he	108	" I was not saying anything about it , "
132506	132512	132513	132513	she	114	" Yes , you were , "
132516	132526	132513	132513	she	114	" I do n't know what you call it then "
132534	132540	132542	132542	Meg	114	" Bring Alfy to me , "
132550	132558	132560	132560	George	108	" Oh , no , damn it ! "
132562	132568	132560	132560	George	108	" let Oswald take him . "
132569	132572	132574	132574	Meg	114	" Yes , "
132577	132602	132574	132574	Meg	114	" let anybody take him so long as he 's out of your sight . You never ought to have children , you did n't "
132607	132612	132603	132603	George	108	" to - day . "
132613	132617	132619	132619	Meg	114	" Come then ! "
132642	132664	132628	132628	she	114	" Why , what is it then , what is it , my precious ? Hush then pet , hush then ! "
132693	132702	132703	132703	she	114	" He 's got a bit of wind , "
132720	132728	132730	132730	Meg	114	" I wonder if he 's hungry , "
132732	132738	132730	132730	Meg	114	" let 's try him . "
133055	133063	133064	133064	she	2978	" My leg my leg a bit , "
133136	133139	133140	133140	he	108	" There , "
133145	133154	133140	133140	he	108	" is that any better then , mother ? "
133155	133164	133165	133165	she	2978	" Ay , that 's a bit better , "
133169	133177	133178	133178	he	108	" Should I gi'e thee a drink ? "
133214	133227	133228	133228	I	0	" Does n't it make you miserable to have her always there ? "
133252	133267	133240	133240	He	108	" We 're used to it we never notice her , poor old gran'ma . "
133268	133296	133297	133297	I	0	" But she must have made a difference to you she must make a big difference at the bottom , even if you do n't know it , "
133300	133309	133310	133310	he	108	" She 'd got such a strong character , "
133314	133363	133310	133310	he	108	" she seemed to understand me . She was a real friend to me before she was so bad . Sometimes I happen to look at her generally I never see her , you know how I mean but sometimes I do and then it seems a bit rotten "
133370	133380	133381	133381	he	108	" it seems to take the shine off things , "
133392	133401	133402	133402	He	108	" She 's our skeleton in the closet . "
133456	133462	133463	133463	he	108	" I hate Sunday night , "
133467	133475	133476	133476	I	0	" Because you 've nothing to do ? "
133479	133485	133486	133486	he	108	" I do n't know , "
133489	133522	133486	133486	he	108	" It seems like a gag , and you feel helpless . I do n't want to go to church , and hark at the bells , they make you feel uncomfortable . "
133523	133530	133531	133531	I	0	" What do you generally do ? "
133534	133611	133486	133486	he	108	" Feel miserable I 've been down to Mayhew 's these last two Sundays , and Meg 's been pretty mad .

142836	143063	142829	142829	She	3763	" George Saxton was here to dinner yesterday . He and Leslie had frightful battles over the nationalisation of industries . George is rather more than a match for Leslie , which , in his secret heart , makes our friend gloriously proud . It is very amusing . I , of course , have to preserve the balance of power , and , of course , to bolster my husband 's dignity . At a crucial dangerous moment , when George is just going to wave his bloody sword and Leslie lies bleeding with rage , I step in and prick the victor under the heart with some little satire or some esoteric question , I raise Leslie and say his blood is luminous for the truth , and vous voila ! Then I abate for the thousandth time Leslie 's conservative crow , and I appeal once more to George it is no use my arguing with him , he gets so angry I make an abtruse appeal for all the wonderful , sad , and beautiful expressions on the countenance of life , expressions which he does not see or which he distorts by his oblique vision of socialism into grimaces and there I am ! I think I am something of a Machiavelli , but it is quite true , what I say "
143068	143314	143065	143065	she	3766	" We happened to be motoring from Derby on Sunday morning , and as we came to the top of the hill , we had to thread our way through quite a large crowd . I looked up , and whom should I see but our friend George , holding forth about the state endowment of mothers . I made Leslie stop while we listened . The market - place was quite full of people . George saw us , and became fiery . Leslie then grew excited , and although I clung to the skirts of his coat with all my strength , he jumped up and began to question . I must say it with shame and humility he made an ass of himself . The men all round were jeering and muttering under their breath . I think Leslie is not very popular among them , he is such an advocate of machinery which will do the work of men . So they cheered our friend George when he thundered forth his replies and his demonstrations . He pointed his finger at us , and flung his hand at us , and shouted till I quailed in my seat . I can not understand why he should become so frenzied as soon as I am within range . George had a triumph that morning , but when I saw him a few days later he seemed very uneasy , rather self - mistrustful "
143329	143462	143322	143322	her	3767	" I have had such a lark . Two or three times I have been to the ' Hollies ' ; to socialist meetings . Leslie does not know . They are great fun . Of course , I am in sympathy with the socialists , but I can not narrow my eyes till I see one thing only . Life is like a large , rather beautiful man who is young and full of vigour , but hairy , barbaric , with hands hard and dirty , the dirt ingrained . I know his hands are very ugly , I know his mouth is not firmly shapen , I know his limbs are hairy and brutal : but his eyes are deep and very beautiful . That is what I tell George .

143873	143932	143870	143870	he	108	" Because Meg receives them in such an off - hand fashion . I asked Jim Curtiss and his wife from Everley Hall one evening . We were uncomfortable all the time . Meg had hardly a word for anybody ' Yes ' and ' No ' and ' Hm Hm ! ' They 'll never come again . "
143937	143975	143933	143933	Meg	114	" Oh , I ca n't stand stuck - up folks . They make me feel uncomfortable . As soon as they begin mincing their words I 'm done for I can no more talk than a lobster "

144882	144892	144895	144895	his	4273	" Because you generally sing when Mr. Saxton comes . "

145492	145498	145488	145488	he	313	" It seems a hundred . "
145499	145507	145508	145508	she	288	" It does and it does n't , "
145513	145552	145488	145488	he	313	" If I look straight back , and think of my excitement , it seems only yesterday . If I look between then and now , at all the days that lie between , it is an age . "
145553	145560	145561	145561	he	313	" If I look at myself , "
145564	145573	145561	145561	he	313	" I think I am another person altogether . "

145588	145621	145580	145580	she	288	" There is a great change but you are not another person . I often think there is one of his old looks , he is just the same at the bottom ! "
145640	145647	145648	145648	he	313	" The worst of it is , "
145651	145680	145648	145648	he	313	" I have got a miserable carelessness , a contempt for things . You know I had such a faculty for reverence . I always believed in things . "
145681	145687	145688	145688	she	288	" I know you did , "
145691	145730	145688	145688	she	288	" You were so humbly - minded too humbly - minded , I always considered . You always thought things had a deep religious meaning , somewhere hidden , and you reverenced them . Is it different now ? "
145731	145738	145739	145739	he	313	" You know me very well , "
145742	145758	145739	145739	he	313	" What is there left for me to believe in , if not in myself ? "

145837	145841	145843	145843	he	313	" I think , "
145845	145880	145843	145843	he	313	" marriage is more of a duel than a duet . One party wins and takes the other captive , slave , servant what you like . It is so , more or less . "
145881	145884	145886	145886	Lettie	313	" Well ? "
145888	145891	145892	145892	he	313	" Well ! "
145895	145922	145892	145892	he	313	" Meg is not like you . She wants me , part of me , so she 'd kill me rather than let me go loose . "
145923	145928	145930	145930	Lettie	313	" Oh , no ! "
145934	145941	145942	145942	he	313	" You know nothing about it , "
145946	146014	145892	145892	he	313	" In the marital duel Meg is winning . The woman generally does ; she has the children on her side . I ca n't give her any of the real part of me , the vital part that she wants I ca n't , any more than you could give kisses to a stranger . And I feel that I 'm losing and do n't care . "
146015	146018	146019	146019	she	3855	" No , "
146022	146028	146019	146019	she	3855	" you are getting morbid . "

146066	146082	146063	146063	she	3855	" Let me sing to you , shall I , and make you cheerful again ? "

146188	146193	146175	146175	she	3855	" I am sorry . "
146194	146200	146201	146201	she	3855	" What is the matter ? "
146213	146216	146217	146217	he	313	" Nothing ! "
146219	146226	146175	146175	she	3855	" You are looking very beautiful . "
146227	146256	146175	146175	she	3855	" There , I wanted you to say that ! You ought to be quite gay , you know , when I am so smart to - night . "
146257	146260	146261	146261	he	313	" Nay , "
146264	146294	146261	146261	he	313	" I know I ought . But the to - morrow seems to have fallen in love with me . I ca n't get out of its lean arms . "
146295	146298	146299	146299	she	3855	" Why ! "
146302	146319	146299	146299	she	3855	" To - morrow 's arms are not lean . They are white , like mine . "
146331	146337	146338	146338	he	313	" How do you know ? "
146343	146351	146353	146353	her	3855	" Oh , of course they are , "
146364	146367	146368	146368	he	313	" No ! "
146371	146380	146368	146368	he	313	" It came when the children kissed us . "
146381	146384	146385	146385	she	3855	" What ? "
146388	146405	146406	146406	he	313	" These lean arms of tomorrow 's round me , and the white arms round you , "
146420	146425	146426	146426	she	3855	" You foolish boy , "
146440	146444	146445	146445	he	313	" You know , "
146455	146473	146449	146449	his	313	" I have needed you for a light . You will soon be the only light again . "

146484	146489	146490	146490	he	313	" My little girl ! "
146497	146518	146494	146494	he	313	" And you know , I could n't endure complete darkness , I could n't . It 's the solitariness . "
146519	146527	146528	146528	she	3855	" You must n't talk like this , "
146531	146538	146528	146528	she	3855	" You know you must n't . "
146558	146569	146570	146570	she	3855	" It is as thick as ever , your hair , "
146633	146642	146643	146643	she	3855	" I believe you would have a parting , "
146673	146682	146683	146683	he	313	" I was only a warmth to you , "
146693	146722	146683	146683	he	313	" So you could do without me . But you were like the light to me , and otherwise it was dark and aimless . Aimlessness is horrible . "
146741	146744	146745	146745	she	3855	" There ! "
146748	146767	146745	146745	she	3855	" It looks fair fine , as Alice would say . Raven 's wings are raggy in comparison . "

151195	151209	151192	151192	he	313	" You mean it 's like giving a child fire to play with . "

152800	152940	152760	152760	she	3995	" Oh dear Cyril , I 'm in a bubbling state , I want to yell , not write . Oh , Cyril , why did n't you marry me , or why did n't our Georgie Saxton , or somebody . I 'm deadly sick . Percival Charles is enough to stop a clock . Oh , Cyril , he lives in an eternal Sunday suit , holy broadcloth and righteous three inches of cuffs ! He goes to bed in it . Nay , he wallows in Bibles when he goes to bed . I can feel the brass covers of all his family Bibles sticking in my ribs as I lie by his side . I could weep with wrath , yet I put on my black hat and trot to chapel with him like a lamb .
152941	153040	152760	152760	she	3995	" Oh , Cyril , nothing 's happened . Nothing has happened to me all these years . I shall die of it . When I see Percival Charles at dinner , after having asked a blessing , I feel as if I should never touch a bit at his table again . In about an hour I shall hear him hurrying up the entry prayers always make him hungry and his first look will be on the table . But I 'm not fair to him he 's really a good fellow I only wish he was n't .
153041	153100	152760	152760	she	3995	" It 's George Saxton who 's put this seidlitz powder in my marital cup of cocoa . Cyril , I must a tale unfold . It is fifteen years since our George married Meg . When I count up , and think of the future , it nearly makes me scream . But my tale , my tale !
153101	153269	152760	152760	she	3995	" Can you remember his faithful - dog , wounded - stag , gentle - gazelle eyes ? Cyril , you can see the whisky or the brandy combusting in them . He 's got d t 's , blue - devils and I 've seen him , and I 'm swarming myself with little red devils after it . I went up to Eberwich on Wednesday afternoon for a pound of fry for Percival Charles ' Thursday dinner . I walked by that little path which you know goes round the back of the ' Hollies ' it 's as near as any way for me . I thought I heard a row in the paddock at the back of the stables , so I said I might as well see the fun . I went to the gate , basket in one hand , ninepence in coppers in the other , a demure deacon 's wife . I did n't take in the scene at first .
153270	153687	152760	152760	she	3995	" There was our Georgie , in leggings and breeches as of yore , and a whip . He was flourishing , and striding , and yelling . ' Go it old boy , ' I said , ' you 'll want your stocking round your throat to - night . ' But Cyril , I had spoken too soon . Oh , lum ! There came raking up the croft that long , wire - springy racehorse of his , ears flat , and , clinging to its neck , the pale - faced lad , Wilfred . The kid was white as death , and squealing ' Mam ! mam ! ' I thought it was a bit rotten of Georgie trying to teach the kid to jockey . The race - horse , Bonny - Boy Boney Boy I call him came bouncing round like a spiral egg - whish . Then I saw our Georgie rush up screaming , nearly spitting the moustache off his face , and fetch the horse a cut with the whip . It went off like a flame along hot paraffin . The kid shrieked and clung . Georgie went rushing after him , running staggery , and swearing , fairly screaming , awful ' a lily - livered little swine ! ' The high lanky race - horse went larroping round as if it was going mad . I was dazed . Then Meg came rushing , and the other two lads , all screaming . She went for George , but he lifted his whip like the devil . She dare n't go near him she rushed at him , and stopped , rushed at him , and stopped , striking at him with her two fists . He waved his whip and kept her off , and the race - horse kept tearing along . Meg flew to stop it , he ran with his drunken totter - step , brandishing his whip . I flew as well . I hit him with my basket . The kid fell off , and Meg rushed to him . Some men came running . George stood fairly shuddering . You would never have known his face , Cyril . He was mad , demoniacal . I feel sometimes as if I should burst and shatter to bits like a sky - rocket when I think of it . I 've got such a weal on my arm .
153688	153803	152760	152760	she	3995	" I lost Percival Charles ' ninepence and my nice white cloth out of the basket , and everything , besides having black looks on Thursday because it was mutton chops , which he hates . Oh , Cyril , ' I wish I was a cassowary , on the banks of the Timbuctoo . ' When I saw Meg sobbing over that lad thank goodness he was n't hurt ! I wished our Georgie was dead ; I do now , also ; I wish we only had to remember him . I have n't been to see them lately ca n't stand Meg 's ikeyness . I wonder how it all will end .
153804	153826	152760	152760	she	3995	" There 's P. C. bidding ' Good night and God Bless You ' to Brother Jakes , and no supper ready "

The dogwood berries stood jauntily scarlet on the hedge - tops , the bunched scarlet and green berries of the convolvulus and bryony hung amid golden trails , the blackberries dropped ungathered . I rode slowly on , the plants dying around me , the berries leaning their heavy ruddy mouths , and languishing for the birds , the men imprisoned underground below me , the brown birds dashing in haste along the hedges .

154972	155022	154909	154909	She	109	" Oh , he was better of that very nearly before he came here . He sometimes fancies they 're coming on again , and he 's terrified . Is n't it awful ! And he 's brought it all on himself . Tom 's very good to him . "
