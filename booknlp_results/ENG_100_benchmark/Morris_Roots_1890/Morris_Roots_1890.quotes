5846	5886	5829	5829	He	677	' Ho , Kettel ! Are all men gone without doors to sleep so near the winter - tide , that the Hall is as dark as a cave ? Hither to me ! Or art thou also sleeping ? '
5898	5944	6005	6007	a third voice	700	' Yea , lord , asleep I am , and have been , and dreaming ; and in my dream I dealt with the flesh - pots and the cake - board , and thou shalt see my dream come true presently to thy gain . '
5949	5994	6002	6002	him	699	' Kettel hath had out that share of his dream already belike , if the saw sayeth sooth about cooks . All ye have been away , so belike he hath done as Rafe 's dog when Rafe ran away from the slain buck . '
6020	6057	6012	6014	The young man	677	' Here I bring the venison which my kinsman desired ; but as ye see I have brought it over - late : but take it , Kettel . When cometh my father from the stithy ? '
6061	6107	6058	6059	Quoth Kettel	203	' My lord hath been hard at it shaping the Yule - tide sword , and doth not lightly leave such work , as ye wot , but he will be here presently , for he has sent to bid us dight for supper straightway . '
6113	6142	6109	6111	the young man	677	' Where are there lords in the dale , Kettel , or hast thou made some thyself , that thou must be always throwing them in my teeth ? '
6143	6149	6151	6151	Kettel	203	' Son of the Alderman , '
6153	6231	6151	6151	Kettel	203	' ye call me Kettel , which is no name of mine , so why should I not call thee lord , which is no dignity of thine , since it goes well over my tongue from old use and wo nt ? But here comes my mate of the kettle , and the women and lads . Sit down by the hearth away from their hurry , and I will fetch thee the hand - water . '
6343	6734	6327	6327	he	677	' House , so long familiar to him ; yet to - night he had a pleasure in it above his wo nt , and in all the stir of the household ; for the thought of the wood wherein he had wandered all day yet hung heavy upon him . Came one of the girls and cast fresh brands on the smouldering fire and stirred it into a blaze , and the wax candles were set up on the dais , so that between them and the mew - quickened fire every corner of the hall was bright . As aforesaid it was long and narrow , over - arched with stone and not right high , the windows high up under the springing of the roof - arch and all on the side toward the street ; over against them were the arches of the shut - beds of the housemates . The walls were bare that evening , but folk were wo nt to hang up hallings of woven pictures thereon when feasts and high - days were toward ; and all along the walls were the tenter - hooks for that purpose , and divers weapons and tools were hanging from them here and there . About the dais behind the thwart - table were now stuck for adornment leavy boughs of oak now just beginning to turn with the first frosts . High up on the gable wall above the tenter - hooks for the hangings were carven fair imagery and knots and twining stems ; for there in the hewn atone was set forth that same image with the rayed head that was on the outside wall , and he was smiting the dragon and slaying him ; but here inside the house all this was stained in fair and lively colours , and the sun - like rays round the head of the image were of beaten gold . At the lower end of the hall were two doors going into the butteries , and kitchen , and other out - bowers ; and above these doors was a loft upborne by stone pillars , which loft was the sleeping chamber of the goodman of the house ; but the outward door was halfway between the said loft and the hearth of the hall .
8073	8112	8069	8070	the Alderman	590	' Scarce are the wood - deer grown , kinsman , when I must needs eat sheep 's flesh on a Thursday , though my son has lain abroad in the woods all night to hunt for me . '
8132	8153	8125	8127	Gold - mane	243	' So is it , kinsman , I can hit what I can see ; but not what is hidden . '
8161	8179	8154	8156	Iron - face	205	' Hast thou been to the Woodland - Carles ? are their women fairer than our cousins ? '
8212	8275	8207	8208	his father	783	' Nay , father , I saw not the Wood - carles , nor went to their abode ; and on no day do I lust after their women . Moreover , I brought home a roebuck of the fattest ; but I was over - late for Kettel , and the flesh was ready for the board by then I came . '
8276	8281	8353	8353	he	202	' Well , son , '
8292	8337	8288	8288	he	202	' a roebuck is but a little deer for such big men as are thou and I. But I rede thee take the Bride along with thee the next time ; and she shall seek whilest thou sleepest , and hit when thou missest . '
8356	8607	8353	8353	he	202	' Well were that , indeed ! But if ye must needs drag a true tale out of me : that roebuck I shot at the very edge of the wood nigh to the Mote - stead as I was coming home : harts had I seen in the wood and its lawns , and boars , and bucks , and loosed not at them : for indeed when I awoke in the morning in that wood - lawn ye wot of , I wandered up and down with my bow unbent . So it was that I fared as if I were seeking something , I know not what , that should fill up something lacking to me , I know not what . Thus I felt in myself even so long as I was underneath the black boughs , and there was none beside me and before me , and none to turn aback to : but when I came out again into the sunshine , and I saw the fair dale , and the happy abode lying before me , and folk abroad in the meads merry in the eventide ; then was I full fain of it , and loathed the wood as an empty thing that had nought to give me ; and lo you ! all that I had been longing for in the wood , was it not in this House and ready to my hand ? - and that is good meseemeth . '
8641	8767	8636	8636	he	810	' And yet now I am sitting honoured and well - beloved in the House of my Fathers , with the holy hearth sparkling and gleaming down there before me ; and she that shall bear my children sitting soft and kind by my side , and the bold lads I shall one day lead in battle drinking out of my very cup : now it seems to me that amidst all this , the dark cold wood , wherein abide but the beasts and the Foes of the Gods , is bidding me to it and drawing me thither . Narrow is the Dale and the World is wide ; I would it were dawn and daylight , that I might be afoot again . '
8788	9070	8781	8781	his	783	' Kinsman , thou hast a long tongue for a half - trained whelp : nor see I whitherward thy mind is wandering , but if it be on the road of a lad 's desire to go further and fare worse . Hearken then , I will offer thee somewhat ! Soon shall the West - country merchants be here with their winter truck . How sayest thou ? hast thou a mind to fare back with them , and look on the Plain and its Cities , and take and give with the strangers ? To whom indeed thou shalt be nothing save a purse with a few lumps of gold in it , or maybe a spear in the stranger 's band on the stricken field , or a bow on the wall of an alien city . This is a craft which thou mayst well learn , since thou shalt be a chieftain ; a craft good to learn , however grievous it be in the learning . And I myself have been there ; for in my youth I desired sore to look on the world beyond the mountains ; so I went , and I filled my belly with the fruit of my own desires , and a bitter meat was that ; but now that it has passed through me , and I yet alive , belike I am more of a grown man for having endured its gripe . Even so may it well be with thee , son ; so go if thou wilt ; and thou shalt go with my blessing , and with gold and wares and wain and spearmen . '
9071	9074	9076	9080	Face - of - god	202	' Nay , '
9082	9132	9076	9080	Face - of - god	202	' I thank thee , for it is well offered ; but I will not go , for I have no lust for the Plain and its Cities ; I love the Dale well , and all that is round about it ; therein will I live and die . '
9191	9394	9178	9183	the old man Stone - face	817	' Son Gold - mane , it behoveth me to speak , since belike I know the wild - wood better than most , and have done for these three - score and ten years ; to my cost . Now I perceive that thou longest for the wood and the innermost of it ; and wot ye what ? This longing will at whiles entangle the sons of our chieftains , though this Alderman that now is hath been free therefrom , which is well for him . For , time was this longing came over me , and I went whither it led me : overlong it were to tell of all that befell me because of it , and how my heart bled thereby . So sorry were the tidings that came of it , that now meseemeth my heart should be of stone and not my face , had it not been for the love wherewith I have loved the sons of the kindred . Therefore , son , it were not ill if ye went west away with the merchants this winter , and learned the dealings of the cities , and brought us back tales thereof . '
9404	9488	9396	9398	Gold - mane	243	' I tell thee , foster- father , that I have no mind for the cities and their men and their fools and their whores and their runagates . But as for the wood and its wonders , I have done with it , save for hunting there along with others of the Folk . So let thy mind be at ease ; and for the rest , I will do what the Alderman commandeth , and whatso my father craveth of me . '
9489	9497	9499	9499	Stone	206	' And that is well , son , '
9503	9788	9499	9499	Stone	206	' if what ye say come to pass , as sore I misdoubt me it will not . But well it were , well it were ! For such things are in the wood , yea and before ye come to its innermost , as may well try the stoutest heart . Therein are Kobbolds , and Wights that love not men , things unto whom the grief of men is as the sound of the fiddle - bow unto us . And there abide the ghosts of those that may not rest ; and there wander the dwarfs and the mountain - dwellers , the dealers in marvels , the givers of gifts that destroy Houses ; the forgers of the curse that clingeth and the murder that flitteth to and fro . There moreover are the lairs of Wights in the shapes of women , that draw a young man 's heart out of his body , and fill up the empty place with desire never to be satisfied , that they may mock him therewith and waste his manhood and destroy him . Nor say I much of the strong - thieves that dwell there , since thou art a valiant sword ; or of them who have been made Wolves of the Holy Places ; or of the Murder - Carles , the remnants and off - scourings of wicked and wretched Folks - men who think as much of the life of a man as of the life of a fly . Yet happiest is the man whom they shall tear in pieces , than he who shall live burdened by the curse of the Foes of the Gods . '
9823	9915	9820	9820	he	818	' This is long and evil talk for the end of a merry day , O fosterer ! Wilt thou not drink a draught , O Redesman , and then stand up and set thy fiddle - bow a - dancing , and cause it draw some fair words after it ? For my cousin 's face hath grown sadder than a young maid 's should be , and my son 's eyes gleam with thoughts that are far away from us and abroad in the wild - wood seeking marvels . '
9985	10019	9974	9974	he	824	' Here I drink a double health to Face - of - god and the Bride , and the love that lieth between them , and the love betwixt them twain and us . '
10146	10189	10134	10134	he	210	' O why on this morning , ye maids , are ye tripping Aloof from the meadows yet fresh with the dew , Where under the west wind the river is lipping The fragrance of mint , the white blooms and the blue ?
10424	10424	10426	10426	he	839	'
10450	10469	10443	10445	an old man	841	' A cup to the memory of the Mighty of the Day of the Warding of the Ways . '
12014	12072	12006	12010	Face - of - god	878	' Hail to thee , O Warcliff ! Shrewd is the wind this morning , and thou dost well to heed it carefully , this thine orchard , this thy garden , this thy fair apple - tree ! To a good hall thou wendest , and the Wine of Increase shall be sweet there this even . '
12094	12114	12091	12092	the goodman	907	' Wilt thou not be with us , son of the Alderman , as surely thy father shall be ? '
12115	12118	12120	12124	Face - of - god	202	' Nay , '
12126	12141	12120	12124	Face - of - god	202	' though I were fain of it : my own matters carry me away . '
12142	12146	12148	12148	Warcliff	212	' What matters ? '
12150	12160	12148	12148	Warcliff	212	' perchance thou art for the cities this autumn ? '
12170	12177	12161	12165	Face - of - god	202	' Nay , I am not ; '
12186	12198	12161	12165	Face - of - god	202	' All roads lead not down to the Plain , friend . '
12199	12209	12211	12212	the goodwife	908	' What road then farest thou away from us ? '
12214	12221	12222	12222	he	212	' The way of my will , '
12225	12232	12234	12234	she	908	' And what way is that ? '
12236	12265	12234	12234	she	908	' take heed , lest I get a longing to know . For then must thou needs tell me , or deal with the carle there beside thee . '
12266	12271	12273	12277	Face - of - god	202	' Nay , goodwife , '
12279	12311	12273	12277	Face - of - god	202	' let not that longing take thee ; for on that matter I am even as wise as thou . Now good speed to thee and to the new - comer ! '
12702	12739	12684	12684	she	716	' Come hither , thou , and help the others to climb the bank ; for they are beaten in the race , and now must they do after my will ; that was the forfeit . '
12765	12785	12740	12740	He	212	' Hail to thee , Long - coat ! who be they , and whither away this morning early ? '
12801	12844	12797	12797	she	716	' They be the two maidens of my father 's house , whom thou knowest ; and our errand , all three of us , is to Burgstead , the Feast of the Wine of Increase which shall be drunk this even . '
13006	13036	12995	12999	Face - of - god	878	' How comes it , maidens , that ye are but in your kirtles this sharp autumn morning ? or where have ye left your gowns or your cloaks ? '
13071	13180	13063	13066	The last - comer	950	' What ails thee , Gold - mane , to be so careful of us , as if thou wert our mother or our nurse ? Yet if thou must needs know , there hang our gowns on the thorn - bush down yonder ; for we have been running a match and a forfeit ; to wit , that she who was last on the highway should go down again and bring them up all three ; and now that is my day 's work : but since thou art here , Alderman 's son , thou shalt go down instead of me and fetch them up . '
13191	13307	13182	13182	he	955	' That will I not , for there be but twenty - four hours in the day , and what between eating and drinking and talking to fair maidens , I have enough to do in every one of them . Wasteful are ye women , and simple is your forfeit . Now will I , who am the Alderman 's son , give forth a doom , and will ordain that one of you fetch up the gowns yourselves , and that Long - coat be the one ; for she is the fleetest - footed and ablest thereto . Will ye take my doom ? for later on I shall not be wiser . '
13308	13311	13313	13315	the fair woman	956	' Yea , '
13317	13348	13313	13315	the fair woman	956	' not because thou art the Alderman 's son , but because thou art the fairest man of the Dale , and mayst bid us poor souls what thou wilt . '
13754	13798	13742	13742	He	960	' Strange ! yestereven I thought much of the wood , and I set my mind on not going thither , and this morning I thought nothing of it , and here am I amidst its trees , and wending towards its innermost . '
14724	14765	14695	14695	he	960	' What is mine errand hither ? Whither wend I ? What shall I have done to - morrow that I have hitherto left undone ? Or what manner of man shall I be then other than I am now ? '
14908	14938	14898	14898	he	960	' Am I become a mere sport of dreams , whether I sleep or wake ? I will go backward - or forward , but will think no more . '
15311	15414	15306	15306	he	960	' I am a fool : this comes of being alone in the dark wood and the dismal waste , after the merry faces of the Dale had swept away my foolish musings of yesterday and the day before . Lo ! here I stand , a man of the Face , sword and axe by my side ; if death come , it can but come once ; and if I fear not death , what shall make me afraid ? The Gods hate me not , and will not hurt me ; and they are not ugly , but beauteous . '
15659	15772	15643	15643	He	960	' Marvellous ! here is a dwelling of man , scarce a day 's journey from Burgstead ; yet have I never heard tell of it : may happen some of the Woodland - Carles have built it , and are on some errand of hunting peltries up in the mountains , or maybe are seeking copper and tin among the rocks . Well , at least let us go see what manner of men dwell there , and if they are minded for a guest to - night ; for fain were I of a bed beneath a roof , and of a board with strong meat and drink on it . '
16226	16248	16219	16219	he	960	' What aileth , maiden ? is this man thy foe ? doth he oppress thee ? shall I slay him ? '
16254	16277	16249	16249	She	904	' Thou art open - handed in thy proffers : he might have asked the like concerning thee but a minute ago . '
16278	16283	16285	16287	Gold - mane	243	' Yea , yea , '
16292	16301	16285	16287	Gold - mane	243	' but he asked it not of thee . '
16302	16307	16308	16308	she	904	' That is sooth , '
16311	16429	16308	16308	she	904	' but since thou hast asked me , I will tell thee that if thou slay him it will be my harm as well as his ; and in my country a man that taketh a gift is not wo nt to break the giver 's head with it straightway . The man is my brother , O stranger , and presently , if thou wilt , thou mayst be eating at the same board with him . Or if thou wilt , thou mayst go thy ways unhurt into the wood . But I had liefer of the twain that thou wert in our house to - night ; for thou hast a wrong against us . '
16473	16495	16438	16438	she	1039	' Angry is my sister ! good it is to wear the helm abroad when she shaketh the nut - trees . '
16496	16499	16501	16501	she	1039	' Nay , '
16503	16575	16501	16501	she	1039	' it is thy luck that thou wert bare - headed , else had I been forced to smite thee on the face . Thou churl , since when hath it been our wo nt to thrust knives into a guest , who is come of great kin , a man of gentle heart and fair face ? Come hither and handsel him self - doom for thy fool 's onset ! '
16585	16623	16576	16577	The man	669	' Well , sister , least said , soonest mended . A clout on the head is worse than a woman 's chiding ; but since ye have given me one , ye may forbear the other . '
16798	16849	16780	16781	the man	669	' I deemed thee a foe , and I may not have over - many foes alive : but it seems that thou art to be a friend , and that is well and better ; so herewith I handsel thee self - doom in the matter of the onslaught . '
16860	16895	16851	16855	Face - of - god	214	' The doom is soon given forth ; against the tumble on the grass I set the clout on the head ; there is nought left over to pay to any man 's son . '
16903	16940	16897	16901	the scarlet - clad man	1046	' Belike by thine eyes thou art a true man , and wilt not bewray me . Now is there no foeman here , but rather maybe a friend both now and in time to come . '
16970	16977	16957	16961	Face - of - god	878	' Is the peace wholly made ? '
16986	16999	16980	16980	her	904	' Nay , thou art too fair for a woman to kiss . '
17038	17067	17028	17028	she	904	' Now is it for thee to choose betwixt the wild- wood and the hall , and whether thou wilt be a guest or a wayfarer this night . '
17091	17102	17088	17088	he	1046	' I will be thy guest and not thy stranger . '
17103	17107	17108	17108	she	904	' Come then , '
17286	17313	17270	17270	he	1046	' Tell me thy name , tall man ; and thou , fair woman , tell me thine ; for how can we talk together else ? '
17321	17435	17314	17315	The man	669	' The young chieftain thinks that this house also should be his ! Nay , young man , I know what is in thy thought , be not ashamed that thou art wary ; and be assured ! We shall hurt thee no more than thou hast been hurt . Now as to my name ; the name that was born with me is gone : the name that was given me hath been taken from me : now I belike must give myself a name , and that shall be Wild - wearer ; but it may be that thou thyself shalt one day give me another , and call me Guest . '
17557	17579	17536	17536	she	1059	' And as for me , call me the Friend ; the name is good and will serve for many things . '
17663	17675	17660	17660	he	1058	' It is the custom of the Dale to all women . '
17693	17728	17677	17677	she	1059	' Then art thou of Burgdale , and if it were lawful to guess , I would say that thy name is Face - of - god , of the House of the Face . '
17729	17735	17737	17737	he	1058	' Even so it is , '
17739	17756	17737	17737	he	1058	' but in the Dale those that love me do mostly call me Gold - mane . '
17757	17763	17764	17764	she	1059	' It is well named , '
17767	17826	17764	17764	she	1059	' and seldom wilt thou be called otherwise , for thou wilt be well - beloved . But come in now , Gold- mane , for night is at hand , and here have we meat and lodging such as an hungry and weary man may take ; though we be broken people , dwellers in the waste . '
18448	18473	18444	18446	Wild - wearer	6818	' This is good for to - morrow , not for to - day ; the meat is well - nigh on the board . '
18497	18516	18493	18494	the woman	904	' The fault is not mine ; she told me of the coming guest but three hours agone . '
18517	18520	18522	18524	Wild - wearer	6818	' Ay ? '
18526	18534	18522	18524	Wild - wearer	6818	' she looked for a guest then ? '
18535	18540	18542	18543	the woman	904	' Yea , certes , '
18545	18562	18542	18543	the woman	904	' else why went I forth this afternoon , as wearied as I was with yesterday ? '
18563	18568	18570	18572	Wild - wearer	6818	' Well , well , '
18574	18600	18570	18572	Wild - wearer	6818	' get to thy due work or go play ; I meddle not with meat ! and for thee all jests are as bitter earnest . '
18601	18608	18609	18609	she	904	' And with thee , chief , '
18612	18626	18609	18609	she	904	' it is no otherwise ; surely I am made on thy model . '
18627	18635	18637	18637	he	6818	' Thy tongue is longer , friend , '
18639	18656	18637	18637	he	6818	' now tarry if thou wilt , and if the supper 's service craveth thee not . '
19010	19022	19004	19006	the old woman	1120	' Well , lads , have ye been doing or sleeping ? '
19023	19028	19030	19034	one of the young men	1124	' Sleeping , mother , '
19036	19053	19030	19034	one of the young men	1124	' as was but due after last night was , and to - morrow shall be . '

There came a man of the Shepherd- Folk , drunk or foolish , or both , who began to chaffer with the big carle ; but ever on the queen were his eyes set , and presently he put forth his hand to her to clip her , whereon the big carle hove up his fist and smote him , so that he fell to earth noseling . Then ran the folk together to hale off the stranger and help the shepherd , and it was like that the stranger should be mishandled . Then there thrust through the press a young man with yellow hair and grey eyes , who cried out , " Fellows , let be ! The stranger had the right of it ; this is no matter to make a quarrel or a court case of . Let the market go on ! This man and maid are true folk . " So when the folk heard the young man and his bidding , they forebore and let the carle and the queen be , and the shepherd went his ways little hurt . Now then , who was this young man ? '

24069	24126	24066	24066	she	1245	' thou must depart , and that straightway : lo , there lieth thy spear which the Wood - mother hath brought in from the waste .

Well , Alderman 's son , short is the tale to tell : we could not fail to follow the gear , and the slot led us into the wood , and ill is the going there for us shepherds , who are used to the bare downs , save Rusty , who was a good woodsman and lifted the slot for us ; so he outwent us all , and ran out of sight of us , so presently we came upon him dead - slain , with the manslayer 's spear in his breast . What then could we do but turn back again , for now was the wood blind now Rusty was dead , and we knew not whither to follow the fray ; and the man himself was but little loss : so back we turned , and told goodman Penny - thumb of all this , for we had left him alone in his hall lamenting his gear ; so we bided to - day 's morn , and have come out now , with our neighbour and the spear , and the dead corpse of Rusty . Stand aside , neighbours , and let the Alderman 's son see it . '

For the wights that waylay the bodies and souls of the mighty in the wild - wood heed such matters nothing ; yea and at Yule - tide are they most abroad , and most armed for the fray . Even such an one have I seen time agone , when the snow was deep and the wind was rough ; and it was in the likeness of a woman clad in such raiment as the Bride bore last night , and she trod the snow light - foot in thin raiment where it would scarce bear the skids of a deft snow - runner . Even so she stood before me ; the icy wind blew her raiment round about her , and drifted the hair from her garlanded head toward me , and she as fair and fresh as in the midsummer days . Up the fell she fared , sweetest of all things to look on , and beckoned on me to follow ; on me , the Warrior , the Stout - heart ; and I followed , and between us grief was born ; but I it was that fostered that child and not she . Always when she would be , was she merry and lovely ; and even so is she now , for she is of those that be long - lived . And I wot that thou hast seen even such an one ! '

We sat in the hall together and there was no third ; and methought that the birds sang and the flowers bloomed , and sweet was their savour , though it was midwinter . A rose - wreath was on her head ; grapes were on the board , and fair unwrinkled summer apples on the day that we feasted together . When was the feast ? sayst thou . Long ago . What was the hall , thou sayest , wherein ye feasted ? I know not if it were on the earth or under it , or if we rode the clouds that even . But on the morrow what was there but the stark wood and the drift of the snow , and the iron wind howling through the branches , and a lonely man , a wanderer rising from the ground . A wanderer through the wood and up the fell , and up the high mountain , and up and up to the edges of the ice - river and the green caves of the ice - hills . A wanderer in spring , in summer , autumn and winter , with an empty heart and a burning never - satisfied desire ; who hath seen in the uncouth places many an evil unmanly shape , many a foul hag and changing ugly semblance ; who hath suffered hunger and thirst and wounding and fever , and hath seen many things , but hath never again seen that fair woman , or that lovely feast - hall .

Face - of - god for his part went to his shut - bed , and stood by his chest , and opened it , and drew out of it a fine hauberk of ring - mail which his father had made for him : for though Face - of - god was a deft wright , he was not by a long way so deft as his father , who was the deftest of all men of that time and country ; so that the alien merchants would give him what he would for his hauberks and helms , whenso he would chaffer with them , which was but seldom . So Face - of - god did on this hauberk over his kirtle , and over it he cast his foul - weather weed , so that none might see it : he girt a strong war - sword to his side , cast his quiver over his shoulder , and took his bow in his hand , although he had little lust to shoot elks that day , even as Stone - face had said ; therewithal he took his skids , and went forth of the hall to the gate of the Burg ; whereto gathered the whole company of twenty - three , and Gold - mane the twenty - fourth . And each man there had his skids and his bow and quiver , and whatso other weapon , as short - sword , or wood - knife , or axe , seemed good to him .

Thereat the goodman , naked as he was , caught up his sword and made at these murder - carles , and or ever they were ware of him he had hewn down one and turned to face the other , who smote at him with his steel axe and gave him a great wound on the shoulder , and therewithal fled out at the open door and forth into the wood .

Then it fell into his mind that this had been a beloved trysting - place betwixt him and the Bride , and that often when they were little would they come to gather chestnuts in the grove , and thereafter sit and prattle on the old dyke ; or in spring when the season was warm would they go barefoot into the brook , seeking its treasures of troutlets and flowers and clean - washed agate pebbles . Yea , and time not long ago had they met here to talk as lovers , and sat on that very bank in all the kindness of good days without a blemish , and both he and she had loved the place well for its wealth of blossoms and deep grass and goodly trees and clear running stream .

41049	41080	41046	41046	She	1822	' I would have a token of thee that thou shalt show to the God , and swear on it to give me the gift . For the times change . '
41081	41088	41090	41090	he	1821	' What token wilt thou have ? '
41095	41156	41092	41092	She	1822	' When next thou farest to the Wood , thou shalt bring me back , it maybe a flower from the bank ye sit upon , or a splinter from the dais of the hall wherein ye feast , or maybe a ring or some matter that the strangers are wo nt to wear . That shall be the token . '
41179	41258	41167	41167	she	1822	' Woe 's me , woe 's me , Gold - mane ! How evil is this day , when bewailing me I may not bewail thee also ! For I know that thine heart is glad . All through the winter have I kept this hidden in my heart , and durst not speak to thee . But now the spring - tide hath driven me to it . Let summer come , and who shall say ? '
41284	41297	41281	41281	she	1822	' Tell me , Gold - mane , when goest thou thither ? '
41301	41322	41281	41281	she	1822	' I know not surely , may happen in two days , may happen in ten . Why askest thou ? '
41323	41327	41328	41328	she	1822	' O friend ! '
41331	41382	41328	41328	she	1822	' is it a new thing that I should ask thee whither thou goest and whence thou comest , and the times of thy coming and going . Farewell to - day ! Forget not the token . Woe 's me , that I may not kiss thy fair face ! '
41729	41756	41719	41719	his	1821	' Yet remaineth to me the morrow of to - morrow , and that is the first of the days of the watching for the token . '
41887	41901	41875	41875	he	1821	' Is it but a lie and a mocking when all is said ? '
41986	42018	41983	41983	he	1821	' It is well : ten days she gave me , so that she might be able to send without fail on one of them ; she will not fail me . '
42688	42818	42681	42682	Stone- face	244	' Foster - son , thou art happy . Is it that the spring - tide is in thy blood , and maketh thee blithe with all things , or hast thou some new tidings ? Nay , I would not have an answer out of thee ; but here is good rede : when next thou goest into the wood , it were nought so ill for thee to have a valiant old carle by thy side ; one that loveth thee , and would die for thee if need were ; one who might watch when thou wert seeking . Or else beware ! for there are evil things abroad in the Wood , and moreover the brethren of those two felons who were slain at Carlstead . '
43874	43945	44186	44186	they	1905	' space was there something of a break , and they came to the shore of a dark deep tarn on whose windless and green waters the daylight shone fully . The hound skirted the water , and led on unchecked till the trees began to grow smaller and the air colder for all that the sun was higher ; for they had been going up and up all the way .
43953	44182	44186	44186	they	1905	' journey they came clean out of the pine - wood , and before them lay the black wilderness of the bare mountains , and beyond them , looking quite near now , the great ice- peaks , the wall of the world . It was but an hour short of noon by this time , and the high sun shone down on a barren boggy moss which lay betwixt them and the rocky waste . Sure - foot made no stay , but threaded the ways that went betwixt the quagmires , and in another hour led Face - of - god into a winding valley blinded by great rocks , and everywhere stony and rough , with a trickle of water running amidst of it . The hound fared on up the dale to where the water was bridged by a great fallen stone , and so over it and up a steep bent on the further side , on to a marvellously rough mountain - neck , whiles mere black sand cumbered with scattered rocks and stones , whiles beset with mires grown over with the cottony mire - grass ; here and there a little scanty grass growing ; otherwhere nought but dwarf willow ever dying ever growing , mingled with moss or red - blossomed sengreen ; and all blending together into mere desolation .
45410	45451	45401	45401	she	1030	' Now welcome , Gold - mane , welcome , Face - of - god ! and twice welcome art thou and threefold . Lo ! this is the day that thou asked for : art thou happy in it ? '
45545	45565	45514	45514	she	1030	' I do not bid thee hold thy peace ; yet thou sayest nought . Is well with thee ? '
45566	45569	45570	45570	he	7294	' Yea , '
45573	45579	45570	45570	he	7294	' and more than well . '

45612	45626	45610	45610	he	7294	' none hindered me ; thou hast made the ways easy to me . '
45631	45684	45627	45627	She	1030	' Such as I might do , I did . But we may not wield everything , for our foes are many , and I feared for thee . But come thou into our house , which is ours , and far more ours than the booth before the pine - wood . '
45821	45900	45818	45819	the Friend	6820	' So it is : thou beholdest the token of the God and Father of out Fathers , that telleth the tale of so many days , that the days which now pass by us be to them but as the drop in the sea of waters . Thou beholdest the sign of our sorrow , the memory of our wrong ; yet is it also the token of our hope . Maybe it shall lead thee far . '
45901	45904	45906	45906	he	7294	' Whither ? '
46021	46068	46007	46007	she	1030	' My friend , the Wolf shall lead thee no - whither but where I also shall be , whatsoever peril or grief may beset the road or lurk at the ending thereof . Thou shalt be no thrall , to labour while I look on . '
46113	46232	46102	46102	she	1030	' Come in , Gold - mane , come into our house ; for I have many things to say to thee . And moreover thou art so hushed , and so fearsome in thy mail , that I think thou yet deemest me to be a Wight of the Waste , such as Stone - face thy Fosterer told thee tales of , and forewarned thee . So would I eat before thee , and sign the meat with the sign of the Earth - god 's Hammer , to show thee that he is in error concerning me , and that I am a very woman flesh and fell , as my kindred were before me . '
46243	46287	46233	46233	He	1967	' Tell me now , kind friend , dost thou deem that Stone - face 's tales are mere mockery of his dreams , and that he is beguiled by empty semblances or less ? Or are there such Wights in the Waste . '
46288	46291	46292	46292	she	1968	' Nay , '
46295	46380	46292	46292	she	1968	' the man is a true man ; and of these things are there many ancient tales which we may not doubt . Yet so it is that such wights have I never yet seen , nor aught to scare me save evil men : belike it is that I have been over - much busied in dealing with sorrow and ruin to look after them : or it may be that they feared me and the wrath - breeding grief of the kindred . '
46403	46425	46400	46400	she	1968	' It is of men we must talk , and of me and thee . Come with me , my friend . '
46628	46655	46656	46656	she	1968	' Yea , thou lookest a goodly warrior ; yet am I glad that thou camest hither without battle . Tell me , Gold - mane , '
46668	46676	46618	46618	she	1968	' art thou deft with the spear ? '
46677	46684	46686	46686	he	1967	' I have been called so , '
46696	46724	46688	46688	She	1968	' Canst thou show me the feat of spear - throwing in this Hall , or shall we wend outside presently that I may see thee throw ? '

46734	46749	46688	46688	She	1968	' Shall I set this steel in the lintel of the buttery door yonder ? '

46931	46957	46928	46928	She	1968	' Good spear - casting , forsooth ! and far above what our folk can do , who be no great throwers of the spear . '
46963	46968	46970	46970	he	1967	' Sooth is that , '
46972	46985	46970	46970	he	1967	' or hardly were I here to teach thee spear - throwing . '
46986	46997	46998	46998	she	1968	' Wilt thou NEVER be paid for that simple onslaught ? '
47001	47008	47010	47010	he	1967	' Have I been paid then ? '
47055	47151	47044	47044	she	1968	' Good indeed is thy spear - throwing , and meseems my brother will love thee when he hath seen thee strike a stroke or two in wrath . But , fair warrior , there be no foemen here : so get thee to the lower end of the Hall , and in the bower beyond shalt thou find fresh water ; there wash the waste from off thee , and do off thine helm and hauberk , and come back speedily and eat with me ; for I hunger , and so dost thou . '
47227	47327	47221	47222	the Friend	6820	' Now art thou Gold - mane indeed : but come now , sit by me and eat , though the Wood - woman giveth thee but a sorry banquet , O guest ; but from the Dale it is , and we be too far now from the dwellings of men to have delicate meat on the board , though to - night when they come back thy cheer shall be better . Yet even then thou shalt have no such dainties as Stone - face hath imagined for thee at the hands of the Wood - wight . '
47365	47381	47358	47361	Face - of- god	1981	' Sweet it shall be to me ; good is all that the Friend giveth . '

47527	47544	47521	47521	he	1967	' I see the face of the Friend , and it will not change to me . '
47612	47690	47600	47600	she	6820	' O guest from the Dale , I pledge thee ! and when thou hast drunk to me in turn we will talk of weighty matters . For indeed I bear hopes in my hands too heavy for the daughters of men to bear ; and thou art a chieftain 's son , and mayst well help me to bear them ; so let us talk simply and without guile , as folk that trust one another . '
47720	47738	47713	47713	he	1984	' Here in this Hall I drink to the Sons of the Wolf , whosoever they be . '
47746	47774	47743	47743	he	1984	' Simply and guilelessly indeed will I talk with thee ; for I am weary of lies , and for thy sake have I told a many . '
47775	47782	47783	47783	she	6820	' Thou shalt tell no more , '
47786	47818	47783	47783	she	6820	' and as for the health thou hast drunk , it is good , and shall profit thee . Now sit we here in these ancient seats and let us talk . '
47838	47850	47835	47835	she	6820	' Tell me first what tidings have been in the Dale . '
47868	47931	47865	47865	She	6820	' These tidings have we heard before , and some deal of them we know better than ye do , or can ; for we were the ransackers of Penny - thumb and Harts - bane . Thereof will I say more presently . What other tidings hast thou to tell of ? What oaths were sworn upon the Boar last Yule ? '
47951	47964	47946	47946	She	6820	' He shall keep his oath , and yet redden no blade . '
47978	48014	47975	47975	she	6820	' It is good ; but even so would he do and no oath sworn . All men may trust Iron - face . And thou , my friend , what oath didst thou swear ? '
48024	48049	48015	48015	His	1984	' I swore to we d the fairest woman in the world , though the Dalesmen gainsaid me , and they beyond the Dale . '
48050	48053	48054	48054	she	6820	' Yea , '
48057	48146	48054	48054	she	6820	' and there is no need to ask thee whom thou didst mean by thy " fairest woman , " for I have seen that thou deemest me fair enough . My friend , maybe thy kindred will be against it , and the kindred of the Bride ; and it might be that my kindred would have gainsaid it if things were not as they are . But though all men gainsay it , yet will not I. It is meet and right that we twain we d. '
48195	48321	48188	48188	she	6820	' I know thee , how glad thou art of this word of mine , because thou lookest on me with eyes of love , and thinkest of me as better than I am ; though I am no ill woman and no beguiler . But this is not all that I have to say to thee , though it be much ; for there are more folk in the world than thou and I only . But I told thee this first , that thou mightest trust me in all things . So , my friend , if thou canst , refrain thy joy and thy longing a little , and hearken to what concerneth thee and me , and thy people and mine . '
48322	48329	48330	48330	he	1989	' Fair woman and sweet friend , '
48333	48374	48188	48188	she	6820	' thou knowest of a gladness which is hard to bear if one must lay it aside for a while ; and of a longing which is hard to refrain if it mingle with another longing - knowest thou not ? '
48375	48378	48379	48379	she	1990	' Yea , '
48382	48387	48379	48379	she	1990	' I know it . '
48388	48391	48393	48397	Face - of - god	202	' Yet , '
48399	48428	48393	48397	Face - of - god	202	' I will forbear as thou biddest me . Tell me , then , what were the felons who were slain at Carlstead ? Knowest thou of them ? '
48429	48433	48434	48434	she	1990	' Over well , '
48437	48482	48434	48434	she	1990	' they are our foes this many a year ; and since we met last autumn they have become foes of you Dalesmen also . Soon shall ye have tidings of them ; and it was against them that I bade thee arm yesterday . '
48490	48507	48484	48488	Face - of - god	202	' Is it against them that thou wouldst have us do battle along with thy folk ? '
48508	48513	48514	48514	she	1990	' So it is , '
48517	48600	48514	48514	she	1990	' no other foemen have we . And now , Gold - mane , thou art become a friend of the Wolf , and shalt before long be of affinity with our House ; that other day thou didst ask me to tell thee of me and mine , and now will I do according to thine asking . Short shall my tale be ; because maybe thou shalt hear it told again , and in goodly wise , before thine whole folk .
48601	48611	48484	48488	Face - of - god	202	' As thou wottest we be now outlaws and Wolves '
48664	48725	49506	49506	he	1995	' Wherefore are we outlaws ? Because we have been driven from our own , and we bore away our lives and our weapons , and little else ; and for our lands , thou seest this Vale in the howling wilderness and how narrow and poor it is , though it hath been the nurse of warriors in time past .
48726	48875	49506	49506	he	1995	' Hearken ! Time long ago came the kindred of the Wolf to these Mountains of the World ; and they were in a pass in the stony maze and the utter wilderness of the Mountains , and the foe was behind them in numbers not to be borne up against . And so it befell that the pass forked , and there were two ways before our Folk ; and one part of them would take the way to the north and the other the way to the south ; and they could not agree which way the whole Folk should take . So they sundered into two companies , and one took one way and one another . Now as to those who fared by the southern road , we knew not what befell them , nor for long and long had we any tale of them .
48876	49009	49506	49506	he	1995	' But we who took the northern road , we happened on this Vale amidst the wilderness , and we were weary of fleeing from the over - mastering foe ; and the dale seemed enough , and a refuge , and a place to dwell in , and no man was there before us , and few were like to find it , and we were but a few . So we dwelt here in this Vale for as wild as it is , the place where the sun shineth never in the winter , and scant is the summer sunshine therein . Here we raised a Doom - ring and builded us a Hall , wherein thou now sittest beside me , O friend , and we dwelt here many seasons .
49010	49155	49506	49506	he	1995	' We had a few sheep in the wilderness , and a few neat fed down the grass of the Vale ; and we found gems and copper in the rocks about us wherewith at whiles to chaffer with the aliens , and fish we drew from our river the Shivering Flood . Also it is not to be hidden that in those days we did not spare to lift the goods of men ; yea , whiles would our warriors fare down unto the edges of the Plain and lie in wait there till the time served , and then drive the spoil from under the very walls of the Cities . Our men were not little - hearted , nor did our women lament the death of warriors over - much , for they were there to bear more warriors to the Folk .
49156	49242	49506	49506	he	1995	' But the seasons passed , and the Folk multiplied in Shadowy Vale , and livelihood seemed like to fail them , and needs must they seek wider lands . So by ways which thou wilt one day wot of , we came into a valley that lieth north - west of Shadowy Vale : a land like thine of Burgdale , or better ; wide it was , plenteous of grass and trees , well watered , full of all things that man can desire .
49243	49496	49506	49506	he	1995	' Were there men before us in this Dale ? sayest thou . Yea , but not very many , and they feeble in battle , weak of heart , though strong of body . These , when they saw the Sons of the Wolf with weapons in their hands , felt themselves puny before us , and their hearts failed them ; and they came to us with gifts , and offered to share the Dale between them and us , for they said there was enough for both folks . So we took their offer and became their friends ; and some of our Houses wedded wives of the strangers , and gave them their women to wife . Therein they did amiss ; for the blended Folk as the generations passed became softer than our blood , and many were untrusty and greedy and tyrannous , and the days of the whoredom fell upon us , and when we deemed ourselves the mightiest then were we the nearest to our fall . But the House whereof I am would never we d with these Westlanders , and other Houses there were who had affinity with us who chiefly wedded with us of the Wolf , and their fathers had come with ours into that fruitful Dale ; and these were called the Red Hand , and the Silver Arm , and the Golden Bushel , and the Ragged Sword . Thou hast heard those names once before , friend ? '
49497	49500	49501	49501	he	1995	' Yea , '
49550	49605	49546	49546	She	1996	' Fair and goodly is that Dale as mine own eyes have seen , and plentiful of all things , and up in its mountains to the east are caves and pits whence silver is digged abundantly ; therefore is the Dale called Silver - dale . Hast thou heard thereof , my friend ? '
49606	49609	49611	49615	Face - of - god	878	' Nay , '
49617	49630	49611	49615	Face - of - god	878	' though I have marvelled whence ye gat such foison of silver . '
49680	49736	49674	49674	she	1996	' Happy lived the Folk in Silver - dale for many and many winters and summers : the seasons were good and no lack was there : little sickness there was and less war , and all seemed better than well . It is strange that ye Dalesmen have not heard of Silver - dale . '
49737	49740	49742	49742	he	1995	' Nay , '
49744	49787	49742	49742	he	1995	' but I have not ; of Rose - dale have I heard , as a land very far away : but no further do we know of toward that airt . Lieth Silver - dale anywhere nigh to Rose - dale ? '
49791	50163	49788	49788	She	1996	' It is the next dale to it , yet is it a far journey betwixt the two , for the ice - sea pusheth a horn in betwixt them ; and even below the ice the mountain - neck is passable to none save a bold crag - climber , and to him only bearing his life in his hands . But , my friend , I am but lingering over my tale , because it grieveth me sore to have to tell it . Hearken then ! In the days when I had seen but ten summers , and my brother was a very young man , but exceeding strong , and as beautiful as thou art now , war fell on us without rumour or warning ; for there swarmed into Silver - dale , though not by the ways whereby we had entered it , a host of aliens , short of stature , crooked of limb , foul of aspect , but fierce warriors and armed full well : they were men having no country to go back to , though they had no women or children with them , as we had when we were young in these lands , but used all women whom they took as their beastly lust bade them , making them their thralls if they slew them not . Soon we found that these foemen asked no more of us than all we had , and therewithal our lives to be cast away or used for their service as beasts of burden or pleasure . There then we gathered our fighting - men and withstood them ; and if we had been all of the kindreds of the Wolf and the fruit of the wives of warriors , we should have driven back these felons and saved the Dale , though it maybe more than half ruined : but the most part of us were of that mingled blood , or of the generations of the Dalesmen whom we had conquered long ago , and stout as they were of body their hearts failed them , and they gave themselves up to the aliens to be as their oxen and asses .
50164	50224	49788	49788	She	1996	' Why make a long tale of it ? We who were left , and could brook death but not thraldom , fought it out together , women as well as men , till the sweetness of life and a happy chance for escape bid us flee , vanquished but free men . For at the end of three days '
50357	50403	51197	51197	her	2009	' So they forbore us , and night came on moonless and dark ; and it was the early spring season , when the days are not yet long , and so by night and cloud we fled away , and back again to Shadowy Vale .
50404	50518	51197	51197	her	2009	' Forsooth , we were but a few ; for when we were gotten into this Vale , this strip of grass and water in the wilderness , and had told up our company , we were but two hundred and thirty and five of men and women and children . For there were an hundred and thirty and three grown men of all ages , and of women grown seventy and five , and one score and seven children , whereof I was one ; for , as thou mayst deem , it was easier for grown men with weapons in their hands to escape from that slaughter than for women and children .
50519	50744	51197	51197	her	2009	' There sat we in yonder Doom - ring and took counsel , and to some it seemed good that we should all dwell together in Shadowy Vale , and beset the skirts of the foemen till the days should better ; but others deemed that there was little avail therein ; and there was a mighty man of the kindred , Stone - wolf by name , a man of middle - age , and he said , that late in life had he tasted of war , and though the banquet was made bitter with defeat , yet did the meat seem wholesome to him . " Come down with me to the Cities of the Plain , " said he , " all you who are stout warriors ; and leave we here the old men and the swains and the women and children . Hateful are the folk there , and full of malice , but soft withal and dastardly . Let us go down thither and make ourselves strong amongst them , and sell our valour for their wealth till we come to rule them , and they make us their kings , and we establish the Folk of the Wolf amongst the aliens ; then will we come back hither and bring away that which we have left . "
50745	50843	51197	51197	her	2009	' So he spake , and the more part of the warriors yea said his rede , and they went with him to the Westland , and amongst these was my brother Folk - might for that is his name in the kindred . And I sorrowed at his departure , for he had borne me thither out of the flames and the clash of swords and the press of battle , and to me had he ever been kind and loving , albeit he hath had the Words of hard and froward used on him full oft .
50844	51062	51197	51197	her	2009	' So in this Vale abode we that were left , and the seasons passed ; some of the elders died , and some of the children also ; but more children were born , for amongst us were men and women to whom it was lawful to we d with each other . Even with this scanty remnant was left some of the life of the kindred of old days ; and after we had been here but a little while , the young men , yea and the old also , and even some of the women , would steal through passes that we , and we only , knew of , and would fall upon the Aliens in Silver - dale as occasion served , and lift their goods both live and dead ; and this became both a craft and a pastime amongst us . Nor may I hide that we sometimes went lifting otherwhere ; for in the summer and autumn we would fare west a little and abide in the woods the season through , and hunt the deer thereof , and whiles would we drive the spoil from the scattered folk not far from your Shepherd - Folk ; but with the Shepherds themselves and with you Dalesmen we meddled not .
51063	51114	51197	51197	her	2009	' Now that little wood - lawn with the toft of an ancient dwelling in it , wherein , saith Bow - may , thou didst once rest , was one of our summer abodes ; and later on we built the hall under the pine - wood that thou knowest .
51115	51186	51197	51197	her	2009	' Thus then grew up our young men ; and our maids were little softer ; e'en such as Bow - may is and kind is she withal , and it seemed in very sooth as if the Spirit of the Wolf was with us , and the roughness of the Waste made us fierce ; and law we had not and heeded not , though love was amongst us . '
51216	51344	51202	51202	she	2009	' Desolate and dreary is the Dale , thou deemest , friend ; and yet for me I love it and its dark - green water , and it is to me as if the Fathers of the kindred visit it and hold converse with us ; and there I grew up when I was little , before I knew what a woman was , and strange communings had I with the wilderness . Friend , when we are wedded , and thou art a great chieftain , as thou wilt be , I shall ask of thee the boon to suffer me to abide here at whiles that I may remember the days when I was little and the love of the kindred waxed in me . '
51345	51355	51357	51357	Face	206	' This is but a little thing to ask , '
51363	51372	51357	51357	Face	206	' I would thou hadst asked me more . '
51373	51377	51378	51378	she	878	' Fear not , '
51381	51402	51378	51378	she	878	' I shall ask thee for much and many things ; and some of them belike thou shalt deny me . '
51417	51611	51409	51409	she	878	' Yea , so it is , friend ; but hearken . The seasons passed , and six years wore , and I was grown a tall slim maiden , fleet of foot and able to endure toil enough , though I never bore weapons , nor have done . So on a fair even of midsummer when we were together , the most of us , round about this Hall and the Doom - ring , we saw a tall man in bright war - gear come forth into the Dale by the path that thou camest , and then another and another till there were two score and seven men - at - arms standing on the grass below the scree yonder ; by that time had we gotten some weapons in our hands , and we stood together to meet the new - comers , but they drew no sword and notched no shaft , but came towards us laughing and joyous , and lo ! it was my brother Folk - might and his men , those that were left of them , come back to us from the Westland .
51612	51644	51409	51409	she	878	' Glad indeed was I to behold him ; and for him when he had taken me in his arms and looked up and down the Dale , he cried out : '
51668	51668	51663	51663	I	0	'
51669	51755	51409	51409	she	878	' Now when we asked him concerning Stone - wolf and the others who were missing for ten tens of stalwarth men had fared to the Westland , he swept out his hand toward the west and said with a solemn face : " There they lie , and grass groweth over their bones , and we who have come aback , and ye who have abided , these are now the children of the Wolf : there are no more now on the earth . "
51756	51836	51663	51663	I	0	' Let be ! It was a fair even and high was the feast in the Hall that night , and sweet was the converse with our folk come back . A glad man was my brother Folk - might when he heard that for years past we had been lifting the gear of men , and chiefly of the Aliens in Silver - dale : and he himself was become learned in war and a deft leader of men .
51837	52044	51409	51409	she	878	' So the days passed and the seasons , and we lived on as we might ; but with Folk - might 's return there began to grow up in all our hearts what had long been flourishing in mine , and that was the hope of one day winning back our own again , and dying amidst the dear groves of Silver - dale . Within these years we had increased somewhat in number ; for if we had lost those warriors in the Westland , and some old men who had died in the Dale , yet our children had grown up I have now seen twenty and one summers and more were growing up . Moreover , after the first year , from the time when we began to fall upon the Dusky Men of Silver - dale , from time to time they who went on such adventures set free such thralls of our blood as they could fall in with and whom they could trust in , and they dwelt and yet dwell with us in the Dale : first and last we have taken in three score and twelve of such men , and a score of women - thralls withal .
52045	52115	51663	51663	I	0	' Now during these seasons , and not very long ago , after I was a woman grown , the thought came to me , and to Folk - might also , that there were kindreds of the people dwelling anear us whom we might so deal with that they should become our friends and brothers in arms , and that through them we might win back Silver - dale .
52116	52209	51409	51409	she	878	' Of Rose - dale we wotted already that the Folk were nought of our blood , feeble in the field , cowed by the Dusky Men , and at last made thralls to them ; so nought was to do there . But Folk - might went to and fro to gather tidings : at whiles I with him , at whiles one or more of Wood - father 's children , who with their father and mother and Bow - may have abided in the Vale ever since the Great Undoing .
52210	52289	51663	51663	I	0	' Soon he fell in with thy Folk , and first of all with the Woodlanders , and that was a joy to him ; for wot ye what ? He got to know that these men were the children of those of our Folk who had sundered from us in the mountain passes time long and long ago ; and he loved them , for he saw that they were hardy and trusty , and warriors at heart .
52290	52343	51409	51409	she	878	' Then he went amongst the Shepherd - Folk , and he deemed them good men easily stirred , and deemed that they might soon be won to friendship ; and he knew that they were mostly come from the Houses of the Woodlanders , so that they also were of the kindred .
52344	52518	51663	51663	I	0	' And last he came into Burgdale , and found there a merry and happy Folk , little wo nt to war , but stout - hearted , and nowise puny either of body or soul ; he went there often and learned much about them , and deemed that they would not be hard to win to fellowship . And he found that the House of the Face was the chiefest house there ; and that the Alderman and his sons were well beloved of all the folk , and that they were the men to be won first , since through them should all others be won . I also went to Burgstead with him twice , as I told thee erst ; and I saw thee , and I deemed that thou wouldest lightly become our friend ; and it came into my mind that I myself might we d thee , and that the House of the Face thereby might have affinity thenceforth with the Children of the Wolf . '
52522	52534	52519	52519	He	2015	' Why didst thou deem thus of me , O friend ? '
52540	52638	52535	52535	She	2015	' Dost thou long to hear me say the words when thou knowest my thought well ? So be it . I saw thee both young and fair ; and I knew thee to be the son of a noble , worthy , guileless man and of a beauteous woman of great wits and good rede . And I found thee to be kind and open - handed and simple like thy father , and like thy mother wiser than thou thyself knew of thyself ; and that thou wert desirous of deeds and fain of women . '
52654	52666	52651	52651	he	2017	' Didst thou draw me to the woods and to thee ? '

But dost thou not remember , Gold - mane , how that one day last Hay - month , as ye were resting in the meadows in the cool of the evening , there came to you a minstrel that played to you on the fiddle , and therewith sang a song that melted all your hearts , and that this song told of the Wild - wood , and what was therein of desire and peril and beguiling and death , and love unto Death itself ? Dost thou remember , friend ? '
52821	52824	52825	52825	he	2018	' Yea , '
52828	52869	52825	52825	he	2018	' and how when the minstrel was done Stone - face fell to telling us more tales yet of the woodland , and the minstrel sang again and yet again , till his tales had entered into my very heart . '
52870	52873	52874	52874	she	2018	' Yea , '
52877	52914	52874	52874	she	2018	' and that minstrel was Wood - wont ; and I sent him to sing to thee and thine , deeming that if thou didst hearken , thou would'st seek the woodland and happen upon us . '
52920	52940	52915	52915	He	2018	' Thou didst not doubt but that if we met , thou mightest do with me as thou wouldest ? '
52941	52946	52947	52947	she	2018	' So it is , '
52950	52957	52947	52947	she	2018	' that I doubted it little . '
52958	52964	52966	52966	Face	206	' Therein wert thou wise , '
52972	53014	52966	52966	Face	206	' but now that we are talking without guile to each other , mightest thou tell me wherefore it was that Folk - might made that onslaught upon me ? For certain it is that he was minded to slay me . '
53018	53539	53015	53015	She	2018	' It was sooth what I told thee , that whiles he groweth so battle - eager that whatso edge - tool he beareth must needs come out of the scabbard ; but there was more in it than that , which I could not tell thee erst . Two days before thy coming he had been down to Burgstead in the guise of an old carle such as thou sawest him with me in the market - place . There was he guested in your Hall , and once more saw thee and the Bride together ; and he saw the eyes of love wherewith she looked on thee for so much he told me , and deemed that thou didst take her love but lightly . And he himself looked on her with such love and this he told me not that he deemed nought good enough for her , and would have had thee give thyself up wholly to her ; for my brother is a generous man , my friend . So when I told him on the morn of that day whereon we met that we looked to see thee that eve for indeed I am somewhat foreseeing , he said : " Look thou , Sun - beam , if he cometh , it is not unlike that I shall drive a spear through him . " " Wherefore ? " said I ; " can he serve our turn when he is dead ? " Said he : " I care little . Mine own turn will I serve . Thou sayest WHEREFORE ? I tell thee this stripling beguileth to her torment the fairest woman that is in the world - such an one as is meet to be the mother of chieftains , and to stand by warriors in their day of peril . I have seen her ; and thus have I seen her . " Then said I : " Greatly forsooth shalt thou pleasure her by slaying him ! " And he answered : " I shall pleasure myself . And one day she shall thank me , when she taketh my hand in hers and we go together to the Bride - bed . " Therewith came over me a clear foresight of the hours to come , and I said to him : " Yea , Folk - might , cast the spear and draw the sword ; but him thou shalt not slay : and thou shalt one day see him standing with us before the shafts of the Dusky Men . " So I spake ; but he looked fiercely at me , and departed and shunned me all that day , and by good hap I was hard at hand when thou drewest nigh our abode . Nay , Gold - mane , what would'st thou with thy sword ? Why art thou so red and wrathful ? Would'st thou fight with my brother because he loveth thy friend , thine old playmate , thy kinswoman , and thinketh pity of her sorrow ? '
53550	53561	53540	53540	He	2020	' Would the man take her away from me perforce ? '
53562	53566	53567	53567	she	2021	' My friend , '
53570	53634	53567	53567	she	2021	' thou art not yet so wise as not to be a fool at whiles . Is it not so that she herself hath taken herself from thee , since she hath come to know that thou hast given thyself to another ? Hath she noted nought of thee this winter and spring ? Is she well pleased with the ways of thee ? '
53638	53697	53635	53635	He	2022	' Thou hast spoken simply with me , and I will do no less with thee . It was but four days agone that she did me to wit that she knew of me how I sought my love on the Mountain ; and she put me to sore shame , and afterwards I wept for her sorrow . '

Is it not that I should stand by thee and thine in the Folk - mote of the Dalesmen , and speak for you when ye pray us for help against your foemen ; and then again that I do my best when ye and we are arrayed for battle against the Dusky Men ? This is easy to do , and great is the reward thou offerest me . '
53974	53983	53984	53984	she	2029	' I look for this service of thee , '

53993	54003	54005	54005	he	2030	' And when I go down to the battle , '
54007	54016	54005	54005	he	2030	' shalt thou be sorry for our sundering ? '

54037	54052	54035	54035	he	2030	' And if I were slain in the battle , would'st thou lament me ? '
54053	54060	54061	54061	she	2029	' Thou shalt not be slain , '
54077	54094	54074	54074	he	2030	' This then is why thou didst draw me to thee in the Wild - wood ? '
54095	54098	54100	54100	she	2029	' Yea , '
54148	54157	54145	54145	he	2030	' Tell me thy name what it is . '
54161	54170	54158	54158	She	2029	' I am called the Sun - beam . '
54181	54279	54172	54172	he	2030	' O Sun - beam , I have been seeking pleasant and cunning words , and can find none such . But tell me this if thou wilt : dost thou desire me as I desire thee ? or is it that thou wilt suffer me to we d thee and bed thee at last as mere payment for the help that I shall give to thee and thine ? Nay , doubt it not that I will take the payment , if this is what thou wilt give me and nought else . Yet tell me . '
54289	54633	54286	54286	she	2033	' Gold - mane , maybe that thou hast now asked me one question too many ; for this is no fair game to be played between us . For thee , as I deem , there are this day but two people in the world , and that is thou and I , and the earth is for us two alone . But , my friend , though I have seen but twenty and one summers , it is nowise so with me , and to me there are many in the world ; and chiefly the Folk of the Wolf , amidst whose very heart I have grown up . Moreover , I can think of her whom I have supplanted , the Bride to wit ; and I know her , and how bitter and empty her days shall be for a while , and how vain all our redes for her shall seem to her . Yea , I know her sorrow , and see it and grieve for it : so canst not thou , unless thou verily see her before thee , her face unhappy , and her voice changed and hard . Well , I will tell thee what thou askest . When I drew thee to me on the Mountain I thought but of the friendship and brotherhood to be knitted up between our two Folks , nor did I anywise desire thy love of a young man . But when I saw thee on the heath and in the Hall that day , it pleased me to think that a man so fair and chieftain - like should one day lie by my side ; and again when I saw that the love of me had taken hold of thee , I would not have thee grieved because of me , but would have thee happy . And now what shall I say ? - I know not ; I can not tell . Yet am I the Friend , as erst I called myself .
54634	54697	54710	54710	she	2034	' And , Gold - mane , I have seen hitherto but the outward show and image of thee , and though that be goodly , how would it be if thou didst shame me with little - heartedness and evil deeds ? Let me see thee in the Folk - mote and the battle , and then may I answer thee . '
54719	54895	54710	54710	she	2034	' Out on it ! have I beguiled myself as well as thee ? These are but empty words I have been saying . If thou wilt drag the truth out of me , this is the very truth : that to - day is happy to me as it is to thee , and that I have longed sore for its coming . O Gold - mane , O speech - friend , if thou wert to pray me or command me that I lie in thine arms to - night , I should know not how to gainsay thee . Yet I beseech thee to forbear , lest thy death and mine come of it . And why should we die , O friend , when we are so young , and the world lies so fair before us , and the happy days are at hand when the Children of the Wolf and the kindreds of the Dale shall deliver the Folk , and all days shall be good and all years ? '
54976	55067	54968	54968	he	2038	' length from him , and beheld her face how her eyes were closed and her lips quivering . But before him , in a moment of time , passed a picture of the life to be in the fair Dale , and all she would give him there , and the days good and lovely from morn to eve and eve to morn ; and though in that moment it was hard for him to speak , at last he spoke in a voice hoarse at first , and said :
55068	55110	54968	54968	he	2038	' Thou sayest sooth , O friend ; we will not die , but live ; I will not drag our deaths upon us both , nor put a sword in the hands of Folk- might , who loves me not . '
55121	55227	55112	55112	he	2039	' Now shalt thou take me by the hand and lead me forth from the Hall . For the day is waxing old , and here meseemeth in this dim hall there are words crossing in the air about us - words spoken in days long ago , and tales of old time , that keep egging me on to do my will and die , because that is all that the world hath for a valiant man ; and to such words I would not hearken , for in this hour I have no will to die , nor can I think of death . '
55485	55543	55482	55482	she	6820	' This is the altar of the God of Earth , and often hath it been reddened by mighty men ; and thereon lieth the Ring of the Sons of the Wolf ; and now it were well that we swore troth on that ring before my brother cometh ; for now will he soon be here . '
55583	55670	55579	55579	he	2039	' I am Face - of - god of the House of the Face , and I do thee to wit , O God of the Earth , that I pledge my troth to this woman , the Sun - beam of the Kindred of the Wolf , to beget my offspring on her , and to live with her , and to die with her : so help me , thou God of the Earth , and the Warrior and the God of the Face ! '
55678	55742	55579	55579	he	2039	' I , the Sun - beam of the Children of the Wolf , pledge my troth to Face - of - god to lie in his bed and to bear his children and none other 's , and to be his speech - friend till I die : so help me the Wolf and the Warrior and the God of the Earth ! '
55949	56007	55929	55931	Bow - may	224	' So here thou art at last in Shadowy Vale ; and I hope that thou art content therewith , and as happy as I would wish thee to be . Well , this is the first time ; and when thou comest the second time it may well be that the world shall be growing better . '
56072	56120	56061	56064	The Sun - beam	7698	' That shall not fail to be , Bow - may : ye have won a new friend to- day . But tell me , when dost thou look to see the men here , for I was down by the water when they went away yesterday ? '
56121	56133	56135	56137	Bow - may	224	' They shall come into the Dale a little after sunset , '
56139	56148	56150	56152	Gold - mane	243	' Shall I abide them , my friend ? '
56160	56163	56164	56164	she	224	' Yea , '
56167	56198	56164	56164	she	224	' for what else art thou come hither ? or art thou so pressed to depart from us ? Last time we met thou wert not so hasty to sunder . '

Time was I schemed and planned for this day of betrothal ; but now I tell thee it has become no longer needful for bringing to pass our fellowship in arms with thy people . Yea yesterday , ere he went on a hunt , whereof he shall tell thee , Folk - might was against it , in words at least ; and yet as one who would have it done if he might have no part in it . So , in good sooth , this hand that lieth in thine is the hand of a wilful woman , who desireth a man , and would keep him for her speech - friend . Now art thou fond and happy ; yet bear in mind that there are deeds to be done , and the troth we have just plighted must be paid for . So hearken , I bid thee . Dost thou care to know why the wheedling of thee is no longer needful to us ? '
56516	56610	56513	56513	He	2082	' A little while ago I should have said , Yea , If thy lips say the words . But now , O friend , it seemeth as if thine heart were already become a part of mine , and I feel as if the chieftain were growing up in me and the longing for deeds : so I say , Tell me , for I were fain to hear what toucheth the welfare of thy Folk and their fellowship with my Folk ; for on that also have I set my heart ? '
56619	56955	56611	56611	She	2082	' What thou sayest is good : full glad am I that I have not plighted my troth to a mere goodly lad , but rather to a chieftain and a warrior . Now then hearken ! Since I saw thee first in the autumn this hath happened , that the Dusky Men , increasing both in numbers and insolence , have it in their hearts to win more than Silver - dale , and it is years since they have fallen upon Rose - dale and conquered it , rather by murder than by battle , and made all men thralls there , for feeble were the Folk thereof ; and doubt it not but that they will look into Burgdale before long . They are already abroad in the woods , and were it not for the fear of the Wolf they would be thicker therein , and faring wider ; for we have slain many of them , coming upon them unawares ; and they know not where we dwell , nor who we be : so they fear to spread about over - much and pry into unknown places lest the Wolf howl on them . Yet beware ! for they will gather in numbers that we may not meet , and then will they swarm into the Dale ; and if ye would live your happy life that ye love so well , ye must now fight for it ; and in that battle must ye needs join yourselves to us , that we may help each other . Herein have ye nought to choose , for now with you it is no longer a thing to talk of whether ye will help certain strangers and guests and thereby win some gain to yourselves , but whether ye have the hearts to fight for yourselves , and the wits to be the fellows of tall men and stout warriors who have pledged their lives to win or die for it . '
56975	57025	56956	56956	She	2083	' Therefore , Gold - mane , we need thee no longer ; for thou must needs fight in our battle . I have no longer aught to do to wheedle thee to love me . Yet if thou wilt love me , then am I a glad woman . '
57029	57068	57026	57026	He	2084	' Thou wottest well that thou hast all my love , neither will I fail thee in the battle . I am not little - hearted , though I would have given myself to thee for no reward . '

57081	57131	57076	57079	the Sun - beam	7698	' nought is undone by that which I have done . Moreover , it is good that we have plighted troth to - day . For Folk - might will presently hear thereof , and he must needs abide the thing which is done . Hearken ! he cometh . '

57437	57470	57434	57434	he	7596	' Dalesman , it behoveth thy people to bestir them if ye would live and see good days . Hath my sister told thee what is toward ? Or what sayest thou ? '
57471	57481	57483	57487	Face - of - god	206	' Hail to thee , son of the Wolf ! '

57702	57721	57699	57699	she	1059	' that this man and I have plighted troth together at the altar of the Doom - ring . '
57727	57741	57723	57725	Folk - might	7596	' Thou wilt have thy will , and I may not amend it . '
57755	57774	57743	57743	he	6615	' Thou must look to it to keep this oath , whatever other one thou hast failed in . '
57784	57801	57776	57780	Face - of - god	878	' I shall keep it , whether thou biddest me to keep it or break it . '

58004	58120	58000	58000	he	7596	' Thou must pardon us if our words are rough ; for we have stood in rough places , where we had to speak both short and loud , whereas there was much to do . But now will we twain talk of matters that concern chieftains who are going on a hard adventure . And ye women , do ye dight the Hall for the evening feast , which shall be the feast of the troth - plight for you twain . This indeed we owe thee , O guest ; for little shall be thine heritage which thou shalt have with my sister , over and above that thy sword winneth for thee . '

These are of the kind that ye must cast fear into their hearts by falling on them ; for if ye abide till they fall upon you , they are like the winter wolves that swarm on and on , how many soever ye slay . And this above all things shall help you , that we shall bring you whereas ye shall fall on them unawares and destroy them as boys do with a wasp 's nest .

58876	58914	58869	58869	Folk	206	' Yet I would not have thee forget that I was wroth with thee when I saw thee to - day ; and had it not been for the coming battle I had drawn sword upon thee . '

Now that we are friends and fellows , it is no hurt for thee to know the shortest way to Shadowy Vale . What thou shalt tell concerning us in Burgdale I leave the tale thereof to thee ; yet belike thou wilt not tell everything till I come to Burgstead at the spring market - tide . Now must I presently to bed ; for before daylight to - morrow must I be following the hunt along with two score good men of ours . '

In these days we have learned how to find companies of them ; and forsooth every week they draw nigher to this Dale ; and some day they should happen upon us if we were not to look to it , and then would there be a murder great and grim ; therefore we scour the heaths round about , and the skirts of the woodland , and we fall upon these felons in divers guises , so that they may not know us for the same men ; whiles are we clad in homespun , as to - day , and seem like to field- working carles ; whiles in scarlet and gold , like knights of the Westland ; whiles in wolf - skins ; whiles in white glittering gear , like the Wights of the Waste : and in all guises these felons , for all their fierce hearts , fear us , and flee from us , and we follow and slay them , and so minish their numbers somewhat against the great day of battle . '
60420	60424	60426	60428	Gold - mane	243	' Tell me , '

60546	60743	60542	60544	Folk - might	7596	' have seen a many down in the Cities . And there were thralls who were the tyrants of thralls , and held the whip over them ; and of the others there were some who were not very hardly entreated . But with these it is otherwise , and they all bear grievous pains daily ; for the Dusky Men are as hogs in a garden of lilies . Whatsoever is fair there have they defiled and deflowered , and they wallow in our fair halls as swine strayed from the dunghill . No delight in life , no sweet days do they have for themselves , and they begrudge the delight of others therein . Therefore their thralls know no rest or solace ; their reward of toil is many stripes , and the healing of their stripes grievous toil . To many have they appointed to dig and mine in the silver - yielding cliffs , and of all the tasks is that the sorest , and there do stripes abound the most . Such thralls art thou happy not to behold till thou hast set them free ; as we shall do . '
60744	60749	60751	60755	Face - of - god	878	' Tell me again , '
60757	60813	60751	60755	Face - of - god	878	' Is there no mixed folk between these Dusky Men and the Dalesmen , since they have no women of their own , but lie with the women of the Dale ? Moreover , do not the poor folk of the Dale beget and bear children , so that there are thralls born of thralls ? '
60814	60820	60822	60822	Folk	206	' Wisely thou askest this , '
60826	60994	60822	60822	Folk	206	' but thereof shall I tell thee , that when a Dusky Carle mingles with a woman of the Dale , the child which she beareth shall oftenest favour his race and not hers ; or else shall it be witless , a fool natural . But as for the children of these poor thralls ; yea , the masters cause them to breed if so their masterships will , and when the children are born , they keep them or slay them as they will , as they would with whelps or calves . To be short , year by year these vile wretches grow fiercer and more beastly , and their thralls more hapless and down - trodden ; and now at last is come the time either to do or to die , as ye men of Burgdale shall speedily find out . But now must I go sleep if I am to be where I look to be at sunrise to - morrow . '
61034	61069	61017	61020	the Sun - beam	7698	' I shall arise betimes on the morrow ; so I say not farewell to - night ; yea , and after to - morrow it shall not be long ere we meet again . '

'
61289	61360	61280	61280	He	243	' Dawn is in the sky , Dalesman ; there is yet time for thee to wash the night off of thee in our bath of the Shivering Flood and to put thy mouth to the milk - bowl ; but time for nought else : for I and Bow - may are appointed thy fellows for the road , and it were well that we were back home speedily .

Also as I led thee out of the house when we last met , so shall I lead thee out of the Dale to - day , and I will go with thee a little way on the waste ; and therefore am I shod this morning , as thou seest , for the ways on the waste are rough . And now I bid thee have courage while my hand holdeth thine . For afterwards I need not bid thee anything ; for thou wilt have enough to do when thou comest to thy Folk , and must needs think more of warriors then than of maidens . '

But the outgate up the water is called the Road of War , as this is named the Path of Peace . But now are all ways ways of war . '
62302	62310	62312	62314	Gold - mane	243	' There is peace in my heart , '
62363	62615	62360	62360	she	2220	' One thing would I say to thee , my friend . Thou hast seen me amongst men of war , amongst outlaws who seek violence ; thou hast heard me bid my brother to count the slain , and I shrinking not ; thou knowest for I have told thee how I have schemed and schemed for victorious battle . Yet I would not have thee think of me as a Chooser of the Slain , a warrior maiden , or as of one who hath no joy save in the battle whereto she biddeth others . O friend , the many peaceful hours that I have had on the grass down yonder , sitting with my rock and spindle in hand , the children round about my knees hearkening to some old story so well remembered by me ! or the milking of the kine in the dewy summer even , when all was still but for the voice of the water and the cries of the happy children , and there round about me were the dear and beauteous maidens with whom I had grown up , happy amidst all our troubles , since their life was free and they knew no guile . In such times my heart was at peace indeed , and it seemed to me as if we had won all we needed ; as if war and turmoil were over , after they had brought about peace and good days for our little folk .
62616	62690	62360	62360	she	2220	' And as for the days that be , are they not as that rugged pass , full of bitter winds and the voice of hurrying waters , that leadeth yonder to Silver - dale , as thou hast divined ? and there is nought good in it save that the breath of life is therein , and that it leadeth to pleasant places and the peace and plenty of the fair dale .

62699	62923	62696	62696	he	2224	' what thou sayest is better than well : for time shall be , if we come alive out of this pass of battle and bitter strife , when I shall lead thee into Burgdale to dwell there . And thou wottest of our people that there is little strife and grudging amongst them , and that they are merry , and fair to look on , both men and women ; and no man there lacketh what the earth may give us , and it is a saying amongst us that there may a man have that which he desireth save the sun and moon in his hands to play with : and of this gladness , which is made up of many little matters , what story may be told ? Yet amongst it shall I live and thou with me ; and ill indeed it were if it wearied thee and thou wert ever longing for some day of victorious strife , and to behold me coming back from battle high - raised on the shields of men and crowned with bay ; if thine ears must ever be tickled with the talk of men and their songs concerning my warrior deeds . For thus it shall not be . When I drive the herds it shall be at the neighbours '

In a moment , as he rushed at them , one shaft went whistling by him , and the other glanced from off his target ; he cast a spear as he bounded on , and saw it smite one of the shooters full in the naked face , and saw the blood spout out and change his face and the man roll over , and then in another moment four men were hewing at him with their short steel axes . He thrust out his target against them , and then let the weight of his body come on his other spear , and drave it through the second shooter 's throat , and even therewith was smitten on the helm so hard that , though the Alderman 's work held out , he fell to his knees , holding his target over his head and striving to draw forth Dale - warden ; in that nick of time a shaft whistled close by his ear , and as he rose to his feet again he saw his foeman rolling over and over , clutching at the ling with both hands . Then rang out again the terrible wolf - whoop from Wood - wise 's mouth , and both he and Bow - may loosed a shaft , for the two other foes had turned their backs and were fleeing fast . Again Bow - may hit the clout , and the Dusky Man fell dead at once , but Wood - wise 's arrow flew over the felon 's shoulder as he ran . Then in a trice was Gold - mane bounding after him like the hare just roused from her form ; for it came into his head that these felons had beheld them coming up out of the Vale , and that if even this one man escaped , he would bring his company down upon the Vale - dwellers .
64492	64559	64476	64476	he	214	' Rocks , and found there Wood - wise and the dead foemen , for the carle had slain the wounded , and he was now drawing the silver arm - rings off the slain men ; for all these Dusky Felons bore silver arm - rings . But Bow - may was walking towards the Sun - beam , and thitherward followed Gold - mane speedily .

64751	64783	64745	64748	the Sun - beam	7698	' and kind it is of her to say it . I saw thee , Bow - may , and good was thy shooting , and I love thee for it . '
64789	64814	64785	64787	Bow - may	224	' I never shoot otherwise than well . But those idle shooters of the Dusky Ones , whereabouts nigh to thee went their shafts ? '
64821	64882	64816	64819	the Sun - beam	7698	' One just lifted the hair by my left ear , and that was not so ill - aimed ; as for the other , it pierced my raiment by my right knee , and pinned me to the earth , so that I tottered and fell , and my gown and smock are grievously wounded , both of them . '
64912	64920	64921	64921	she	224	' What were best to do now ? '
64931	64969	64925	64929	Face - of - god	878	' Let us tarry a little ; for some of thy carles shall surely come up from the Vale : because they will have heard Wood - wise 's whoop , since the wind sets that way . '
64970	64977	64979	64982	the Sun - beam	7698	' Yea , they will come , '
64984	64989	64991	64995	Face - of - god	214	' Good is that , '
64997	65080	64991	64995	Face - of - god	214	' for they shall take the dead felons and cast them where they be not seen if perchance any more stray hereby . For if they wind them , they may well happen on the path down to the Vale . Also , my friend , it were well if thou wert to bid a good few of the carles that are in the Vale to keep watch and ward about here , lest there be more foemen wandering about the waste . '
65084	65122	65081	65081	She	2259	' Thou art wise in war , Gold - mane ; I will do as thou biddest me . But soothly this is a perilous thing that the Dusky Men are gotten so close to the Vale . '
65130	65192	65124	65128	Face - of - god	214	' This will Folk - might look to when he cometh home ; and it is most like that he will deem it good to fall on them somewhere a good way aloof , so as to draw them off from wandering over the waste . Also I will do my best to busy them when I am home in Burgdale . '
65258	65308	65250	65250	they	2260	' Rocks , so that they might slay the men , and then bear off the woman . He said withal that it would be best to carry their corpses further on , so that they might be cast over the cliffs into the fierce stream of the Shivering Flood .
65402	65424	65426	65426	she	2269	' Now must ye wayfarers depart ; for the road is but rough , and the day not over - long . '
65455	65546	65444	65444	her	2269	' Doth this second parting seem at all strange to thee , and that I am now so familiar to thee , I whom thou didst once deem to be a very goddess ? And now thou hast seen me redden before thine eyes because of thee ; and thou hast seen me grow pale with fear because of thee ; and thou hast felt my caresses which I might not refrain ; even as if I were altogether such a maiden as ye warriors hang about for a nine days '
65595	65595	65591	65591	maid	6943	'
65599	65706	65596	65596	He	442	' In all this there is but one thing for me to say , and that is that I love thee ; and surely none the less , but rather the more , because thou lovest me , and art of my kind , and mayest share in my deeds and think well of them . Now is my heart full of joy , and one thing only weigheth on it ; and that is that my kinswoman the Bride begrudgeth our love together . For this is the thing that of all things most misliketh me , that any should bear a grudge against me . '
65710	65722	65707	65707	She	2273	' Forget not the token , and my message to her . '
65723	65730	65732	65732	he	442	' I will not forget it , '
65734	65768	65732	65732	he	442	' And now I bid thee to kiss me even before all these that are looking on ; for there is nought to belittle us therein , since we be troth - plight . '
66325	66362	66320	66322	Bow - may	224	' I would I were going all the way with thee , Gold - mane ; for I long sore to let my eyes rest a while on the land where I shall one day live . '
66363	66366	66368	66372	Face - of - god	264	' Yea , '
66374	66389	66368	66372	Face - of - god	264	' art thou minded to dwell there ? We shall be glad of that . '
66390	66397	66399	66399	she	224	' Whither are thy wits straying ? '
66401	66416	66399	66399	she	224	' whether I am minded to it or not , I shall dwell there . '
66435	66449	66428	66432	Face - of - god	878	' Good will be thy dwelling ; but wherefore must it be so ? '
66458	66560	66451	66453	Wood - wise	221	' I shall tell thee in fewer words than she will , and time presses now : Wood - father and Wood - mother , and I and my two brethren and this woman have ever been about and anigh the Sun - beam ; and we deem that war and other troubles have made us of closer kin to her than we were born , whether ye call it brotherhood or what not , and never shall we sunder from her in life or in death . So when thou goest to Burgdale with her , there shall we be . '
66604	66652	66595	66599	Face - of - god	264	' Tell me one thing , Wood - wise ; that whoop that thou gavest forth when we were at handy - strokes e'en now - is it but a cry of thine own or is it of thy Folk , and shall I hear it again ? '
66653	66664	66666	66668	Wood - wise	221	' Thou may'st look to hear it many a time , '
66670	66707	66666	66668	Wood - wise	221	' for it is the cry of the Wolf . Seldom indeed hath battle been joined where men of our blood are , but that cry is given forth . Come now , to the road ! '
66918	66923	66925	66925	he	878	' Bow - may , '
66927	67045	66925	66925	he	878	' thou saidst a while ago that thou wouldst be fain to look on Burgdale ; and indeed it is fair and lovely , and ye may soon be in it if ye will . Ye shall both be more than welcome to the house of my father , and heartily I bid you thither . For night is on us , and the way back is long and toilsome and beset with peril . Sister Bow - may , thou wottest that it would be a sore grief to me if thou camest to any harm , and thou also , fellow Wood - wise . Daylight is a good faring - fellow over the waste . '
67051	67146	67047	67049	Bow - may	224	' Thou art kind , Gold - mane , and that is thy wo nt , I know ; and fain were I to - night of the candles in thine hall . But we may not tarry ; for thou wottest how busy we be at home ; and Sun - beam needeth me , if it were only to make her sure that no Dusky Man is bearing off thine head by its lovely locks . Neither shall we journey in the mirk night ; for look you , the moon yonder . '
67147	67150	67152	67156	Face - of - god	878	' Well , '
67158	67187	67152	67156	Face - of - god	878	' parting is ill at the best , and I would I could give you twain a gift , and especially to thee , my sister Bow- may . '
67193	67221	67189	67191	Wood - wise	221	' Thou may'st well do that ; or at least promise the gift ; and that is all one as if we held it in our hands . '
67222	67225	67227	67229	Bow - may	224	' Yea , '
67231	67257	67227	67229	Bow - may	224	' Wood - wise and I have been thinking in one way belike ; and I was at point to ask a gift of thee . '
67258	67263	67265	67267	Gold - mane	243	' What is it ? '
67269	67286	67265	67267	Gold - mane	243	' Surely it is thine , if it were but a guerdon for thy good shooting . '
67300	67316	67297	67297	she	224	' Show us the dint in thine helm that the steel axe made this morning . '
67317	67325	67327	67327	he	2317	' There is no such great dint , '
67329	67344	67327	67327	he	2317	' my father forged that helm , and his work is better than good . '
67345	67348	67350	67352	Bow - may	224	' Yea , '
67354	67391	67350	67352	Bow - may	224	' and might I have hauberk and helm of his handiwork , and Wood - wise a good sword of the same , then were I a glad woman , and this man a happy carle . '
67397	67465	67393	67395	Gold - mane	2318	' I am well pleased at thine asking , and so shall Iron - face be when he heareth of thine archery ; and how that Hall - face were now his only son but for thy close shooting . But now must I to the way ; for my heart tells me that there may have been tidings in Burgstead this while I have been aloof . '
67478	67498	67473	67475	Bow - may	224	' Thou art a kind brother , and soon shall we meet again ; and that will be well . '
67990	68005	67984	67984	his	2320	' For the Burg and the Face ! For the Burg and the Face ! '
68029	68045	68046	68046	He	2320	' For the Face , for the Face ! For the Burg and the Face ! '
68049	68058	68046	68046	He	2320	' So ends the day as it begun , '
68064	68072	68046	68046	He	2320	' For the Burg and the Face ! '
68149	68188	68139	68139	he	206	' Well met , Gold - mane , though thou comest amongst us like Stone - fist of the Mountain . Art thou hurt ? With whom hast thou dealt ? Where be they ? Whence comest thou ? '
68189	68197	68199	68199	Face	206	' Nay , I am not hurt , '
68205	68226	68141	68141	his	206	' Stint thy questions then , till thou hast told me whom thou seekest with spear and sword and candle . '
68227	68233	68235	68235	Hall	206	' Two felons were they , '
68239	68256	68235	68235	Hall	206	' even such as ye saw lying dead at Wood - grey 's the other day . '
68257	68268	68270	68272	Gold - mane	2318	' Then may ye sheathe your swords and go home , '
68274	68303	68270	68272	Gold - mane	2318	' for one lieth at the bottom of the eddy , and the other , thy feet are well - nigh treading on him , Hall - face . '
68436	68443	68445	68445	he	206	' For was it not so , '
68447	68467	68445	68445	he	206	' that thou didst enter into the wood seeking some adventure early in the morning the day before yesterday ? '
68468	68473	68475	68479	Face - of - god	206	' Sooth is that , '
68481	68497	68475	68479	Face - of - god	206	' and I came to Shadowy Vale , and thence am I come this morning . '
68503	68537	68499	68501	Hall - face	206	' I know not Shadowy Vale , nor doth any of us . This is a new word . How say ye , friends , doth any man here know of Shadowy Vale ? '
68542	68545	68538	68538	They	2342	' Nay . '
68552	68572	68548	68550	Hall - face	206	' Hast thou been amongst mere ghosts and marvels , brother , or cometh this tale of thy minstrelsy ? '
68573	68579	68581	68583	Gold - mane	243	' For all your words , '
68585	68832	68581	68583	Gold - mane	243	' to that Vale have I been ; and , to speak shortly for I desire to have your tale , and am waiting for it , I will tell thee that I found there no marvels or strange wights , but a folk of valiant men ; a folk small in numbers , but great of heart ; a folk come , as we be , from the Fathers and the Gods . And this , moreover , is to be said of them , that they are the foes of these felons of whom ye were chasing these twain . And these same Dusky Men of Silver - dale would slay them every man if they might ; and if we look not to it they will soon be doing the same by us ; for they are many , and as venomous as adders , as fierce as bears , and as foul as swine . But these valiant men , who bear on their banner the image of the Wolf , should be our fellows in arms , and they have good will thereto ; and they shall show us the way to Silver - dale by blind paths , so that we may fall upon these felons while they dwell there tormenting the poor people of the land , and thus may we destroy them as lads a hornet 's nest . Or else the days shall be hard for us . '
68859	68960	68856	68856	he	2348	' Brother Gold- mane , these be great tidings . Time was when we might have deemed them but a minstrel 's tale ; for Silver - dale we know not , of which thou speakest so glibly , nor the Dusky Men , any more than the Shadowy Vale . Howbeit , things have befallen these two last days so strange and new , that putting them together with the murder at Wood - grey 's , and thy words which seem somewhat wild , it may well seem to us that tidings unlooked for are coming our way . '
68961	68966	68968	68972	Face - of - god	269	' Come , then , '
68974	68996	68968	68972	Face - of - god	269	' give me what thou hast in thy scrip , and trust me , I shall not jeer at thy tale . '
69002	69070	68998	69000	Hall - face	206	' I also will be short with the tale ; and that the more , as meseemeth it is not yet done , and that thou thyself shalt share in the ending of it . It was the day before yesterday , that is the day when thou departedst into the woods on that adventure whereof thou shalt one day tell me more , wilt thou not ? '
69071	69078	69080	69084	Face - of - god	878	' Yea , in good time , '
69086	69089	68998	69000	Hall - face	206	' Well , '
69095	69245	68998	69000	Hall - face	206	' we went into the woods that day and in the morning , but after sunrise , to the number of a score : we looked to meet a bear and a she - bear with cubs in a certain place ; for one of the Woodlanders , a keen hunter , had told us of their lair . Also we were wishful to slay some of the wild - swine , the yearlings , if we might . Therefore , though we had no helms or shields or coats of fence , we had bowshot a plenty , and good store of casting - weapons , besides our wood - knives and an axe or so ; and some of us , of whom I was one , bore our battle - swords , as we are wo nt ever to do , be the foe beast or man .
69246	69449	68998	69000	Hall - face	206	' Thus armed we went up Wildlake 's Way and came to Carlstead , where half - a - score Woodlanders joined themselves to us , so that we became a band . We went up the half - cleared places past Carlstead for a mile , and then turned east into the wood , and went I know not how far , for the Woodlanders led us by crooked paths , but two hours wore away in our going , till we came to the place where they looked to find the bears . It is a place that may well be noted , for it is unlike the wood round about . There is a close thicket some two furlongs about of thorn and briar and ill - grown ash and oak and other trees , planted by the birds belike ; and it stands as it were in an island amidst of a wide - spreading woodlawn of fine turf , set about in the most goodly fashion with great tall straight - boled oak - trees , that seem to have been planted of set purpose by man 's hand . Yea , dost thou know the place ? '
69450	69455	69457	69459	Gold - mane	243	' Methinks I do , '
69461	69481	69457	69459	Gold - mane	243	' and I seem to have heard the Woodlanders give it a name and call it Boars - bait . '
69482	69487	69489	69489	Hall	206	' That may be , '
69493	69575	69489	69489	Hall	206	' Well , there we were , the dogs and the men , and we drew nigh the thicket and beset it , and doubted not to find prey therein : but when we would set the dogs at the thicket to enter it , they were uneasy , and would not take up the slot , but growled and turned about this way and that , so that we deemed that they winded some fierce beast at our flanks or backs .
69576	69685	69457	69459	Gold - mane	243	' Even so it was , and fierce enough and deadly was the beast ; for suddenly we heard bow - strings twang , and shafts came flying ; and Iron - shield of the Upper Dale , who was close beside me , leapt up into the air and fell down dead with an arrow through his back . Then I bethought me in the twinkling of an eye , and I cried out , " The foe are on us ! take the cover of the tree - boles and be wary ! For the Burg and the Face ! For the Burg and the Face ! "
69686	69734	69489	69489	Hall	206	' So we scattered and covered ourselves with the oak - boles , but besides Iron - shield , who was slain outright , two goodmen were sorely hurt , to wit Bald - face , a man of our house , and Stonyford of the Lower Dale .
69735	69853	69457	69459	Gold - mane	243	' I looked from behind my tree - bole , a great one ; and far off down the glades I saw men moving , clad in gay raiment ; but nearer to me , not a hundred yards from my cover , I saw an arm clad in scarlet come out from behind a tree - bole , so I loosed at it , and missed not ; for straight there tottered out from behind the tree one of those dusky foul - favoured men like to those that were slain by Wood - grey . I had another shaft ready notched , so I loosed and set the shaft in his throat , and he fell .
69854	69908	69489	69489	Hall	206	' Straightway was a yelling and howling about us like the cries of scalded curs , and the oak - wood swarmed thick with these felons rushing on us ; for it seems that the man whom I had slain was a chief amongst them , or we judged so by his goodly raiment .
69909	69960	69457	69459	Gold - mane	243	' Methought then our last day was come . What could we do but run together again after we had loosed at a venture , and so withstand them sword and spear in hand ? Some fell beneath our shot , but not many , for they came on very swiftly .
69961	70085	69489	69489	Hall	206	' So they fell on us ; but for all their fierceness and their numbers they might not break our array , and we slew four and hurt many by sword - hewing and spear - casting and push of spear ; and five of us were hurt and one slain by their dart - casting . So they drew off from us a little , and strove to spread out and fall to shooting at us again ; but this we would not suffer , but pushed on as they fell back , keeping as close together as we might for the trees . For we said that we would all die together if needs must ; and verily the stour was hard .
70086	70141	69457	69459	Gold - mane	243	' Yet hearken ! In that nick of time rose up a strange cry not far from us , Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! How - ow - ow ! ending like the howl of a wolf , and then another and another and another , till the whole wood rang again .
70142	70291	69489	69489	Hall	206	' At first we deemed that here were come fresh foemen , and that we were undone indeed ; but when they heard it , the foe - men before us faltered and gave way , and at last turned their backs and fled , and we followed , keeping well together still : thereby the more part of these men escaped us , for they fled wildly here and there from those who bore that cry with them ; so we knew that our work was being done for us ; therefore we stood , and saw tall men clad in sheep - brown weed running through the glades pursuing those felons and smiting them down , till both fleers and pursuers passed out of our sight like men in a dream , or as when ye roll up a pictured cloth to lay it in the coffer .
70292	70316	69457	69459	Gold - mane	243	' But to Stone - face 's mind those brown - clad men were the Wights of the Wood that be of the Fathers '
70392	70607	70347	70349	Stone - face	206	' So what with one thing , what with another , we turned back : but War- cliff 's brother , a tall man , had felled two of those felons with an oak sapling which he had torn from the thicket ; but he had not slain them , and by now they were just awakening from their swoon , and were sitting up looking round them with fierce rolling eyes , expecting the stroke , for Raven of Longscree was standing over them with a naked war - sword in his hand . But now that our blood was cool , we were loth to slay them as they lay in our hands ; so we bound them and brought them away with us ; and our own dead we carried also on such biers as we might lightly make there , and with them three that were so grievously hurt that they might not go afoot , these we left at Carlstead : they were Tardy the Son of the Untamed , and Swan of Bull- meadow , both of the Lower Dale , and a Woodlander , Undoomed to wit . But the dead were Iron - shield aforesaid , and Wool - sark , and the Hewer , a Woodlander .
70608	70748	70347	70349	Stone - face	206	' So came we sadly at eventide to Burgstead with the two dead Burgdalers , and the captive felons , and the wounded of us that might go afoot ; and ye may judge that they of Burgdale and our father deemed these tidings great enough , and wotted not what next should befall . Stone - face would have had those two felons slain there and then ; for no true tale could we get out of them , nor indeed any word at all . But the Alderman would not have it so ; and he deemed they might serve our turn as hostages if any of our folk should be taken : for one and all we deemed , and still deem , that war is on us and that new folk have gathered on our skirts .
70749	70813	70347	70349	Stone - face	206	' So the captives were shut up in the red out - bower of our house ; and our father was minded that thou mightest tell us somewhat of them when thou wert come home . But about dusk to - day the word went that they had broken out and gotten them weapons and fled up the Dale ; and so it was .
70814	70881	70347	70349	Stone - face	206	' But to - morrow morning will a Gate - thing be holden , and there it will be looked for of thee that thou tell us a true tale of thy goings . For it is deemed , and it is my deeming especially , that thou may'st tell us more of these men than thou hast yet told us . Is it not so ? '
70882	70887	70889	70891	Gold - mane	243	' Yea , surely , '
70893	70957	70889	70891	Gold - mane	243	' I can make as many words as ye will about it ; yet when all is said , it will come to much the same tale as I have already told thee . Yet belike , if ye are minded to take up the sword to defend you , I may tell you in what wise to lay hold on the hilts . '
70958	70964	70966	70966	Hall	206	' And that is well , '
70970	70998	70966	70966	Hall	206	' and no less do I look for of thee . But lo ! here are we come to the Gate of the Burg that abideth battle . '
71157	71195	71150	71153	a very tall man	2367	' Good people , all is well ! the runaways are slain , and Face - of - god is come back with us ; give place a little , that we may come into our house . '
71306	71342	71278	71278	they	2355	' Men in this hall , good is the tidings . The runaways are slain ; and it was Face - of - god who slew them as he came back safe from the waste . '
71660	71750	71650	71652	Iron - face	205	' Kinswoman , thou art pale ; thou hast feared for thy mate amidst all these tidings of war , and still fearest for him . But pluck up a heart ; for the man is a deft warrior for all his fair face , which thou lovest as a woman should , and his hands may yet save his head . And if he be slain , yet are there other men of the kindred , and the earth will not be a desert to thee even then . '

73016	73106	73013	73013	she	755	' for her it is so , and for thee ; but not for me . But now I have brought thee here that thou mightest swear thine oath to me ; lay thine hand on this ring and on this brazen plate whereby the sun measures the hours of the day for happy folk , and swear by the spring - tide of the year and all glad things that find a mate , and by the God of the Earth that rejoiceth in the life of man .

Yesterday I plighted my troth to we d the woman that I met last autumn in the wood . And why ? I wot not why , but that I longed for her . Yet I must tell thee that it seemed to me , and yet seemeth , that I might do no otherwise - that there was nothing else in the world for me to do . What do I deem will come of it , sayest thou ? This , that we shall be happy together , she and I , till the day of our death . '

73712	73785	73709	73709	She	2415	' What sayest thou ? What may grow out of them ? Yea , I have heard those rumours as a man sick to death heareth men talk of their business down in the street while he lieth on his bed ; and already he hath done with it all , and hath no world to mend or mar . For me nought shall grow out of it . What meanest thou ? '

73883	73940	73871	73871	She	2415	' Thou sayest right ; it is not thou that hast done this , but the woman who sent me the ring and the message of an old saw . O that she should be born to sunder us ! How hath it befallen that I am now so little to thee and she so much ? '
73963	73993	73951	73951	Face	202	' Kinswoman , wilt thou for ever begrudge our love ? this grudge lieth heavy on my soul , and it is I alone that have to bear it . '
73997	74047	73994	73994	She	2415	' This is but a light burden for thee to bear , when thou hast nought else to bear ! But do I begrudge thee thy love , Gold- mane ? I know not that . Rather meseemeth I do not believe in it - nor shall do ever . '
74127	74495	74114	74114	she	2415	' These are idle words and avail nothing : one thing only I know , that we are sundered . And now it repenteth me that I have shown thee my tears and my grief and my sickness of the earth and those that dwell thereon . I am ashamed of it , as if thou hadst smitten me , and I had come and shown thee the stripes , and said , See what thou hast done ! hast thou no pity ? Yea , thou pitiest me , and wilt try to forget thy pity . Belike thou art right when thou sayest , To - morrow is a new day ; belike matters will arise that will call me back to life , and I shall once more take heed of the joy and sorrow of my people . Nay , it is most like that this I shall feign to do even now . But if to - morrow be a new day , it is to - day now and not to - morrow , and so shall it be for long . Hereof belike we shall talk no more , thou and I. For as the days wear , the dealings between us shall be that thou shalt but get thee away from my life , and I shall be nought to thee but the name of a kinswoman . Thus should it be even wert thou to strive to make it otherwise ; and thou shalt NOT strive . So let all this be ; for this is not the word I had to say to thee . But hearken ! now are we sundered , and it irketh me beyond measure that folk know it not , and are kind , and rejoice in our love , and deem it a happy thing for the folk ; and this burden I may bear no longer . So I shall declare unto men that I will not we d thee ; and belike they may wonder why it is , till they see thee wedded to the Woman of the Mountain . Art thou content that so it shall be ? '
74503	74536	74497	74501	Face - of - god	202	' Nay , thou shalt not take this all upon thyself ; I also shall declare unto the Folk that I will we d none but her , the Mountain - Woman . '
74540	74625	74537	74537	She	2419	' This shalt thou not do ; I forbid it thee . And I WILL take it all upon myself . Shall I have it said of me that I am unmeet to we d thee , and that thou hast found me out at last and at latest ? I lay this upon thee , that wheresoever I declare this and whatsoever I may say , thou shalt hold thy peace . This at least thou may'st do for me . Wilt thou ? '
74626	74629	74630	74630	he	2420	' Yea , '
74633	74642	74630	74630	he	2420	' though it shall put me to shame . '
74655	74775	74652	74652	she	2421	' O Gold - mane , this would I take upon myself not soothly for any shame of seeming to be thy cast - off ; but because it is I who needs must bear all the sorrow of our sundering ; and I have the will to bear it greater and heavier , that I may be as the women of old time , and they that have come from the Gods , lest I belittle my life with malice and spite and confusion , and it become poisonous to me . Be at peace ! be at peace ! And leave all to the wearing of the years ; and forget not that which thou hast sworn ! '
75708	75850	75690	75691	the Alderman	590	' Now is hallowed in this Gate - thing of the Burgstead Men and the Men of the Dale , wherein they shall take counsel concerning matters late befallen , that press hard upon them . Let no man break the peace of the Holy Thing , lest he become a man accursed in holy places from the plain up to the mountain , and from the mountain down to the plain ; a man not to be cherished of any man of good will , not be holpen with victuals or edge - tool or draught - beast ; a man to be sheltered under no roof - tree , and warmed at no hearth of man : so help us the Warrior and the God of the Earth , and Him of the Face , and all the Fathers ! '
75949	76053	75946	75946	he	2477	' I am Red - coat of Waterless of the Lower Dale . Early this morning as I was going afield I met on the way a man akin to me , Fox of Upton to wit , and he told me that men were being summoned to a Gate - thing . So I turned back home , and caught up any weapon that came handy , and here I am , Alderman , asking thee of the tidings which hath driven thee to call this Thing so hard on the Great Folk - mote , for I know them nothing so . '
76065	76249	76057	76057	Iron	205	' This is well asked , and soon shall ye be as wise as I am on this matter . Know ye , O men of Burgstead and the Dale , that we had not called this Gate - thing so hard on the Great Folk - mote had not great need been to look into troublous matters . Long have ye dwelt in peace , and it is years on years now since any foeman hath fallen on the Dale : but , as ye will bear in mind , last autumn were there ransackings in the Dale and amidst of the Shepherds after the manner of deeds of war ; and it troubleth us that none can say who wrought these ill deeds . Next , but a little while agone , was Wood - grey , a valiant goodman of the Woodlanders , slain close to his own door by evil men . These men we took at first for mere gangrel felons and outcasts from their own folk : though there were some who spoke against that from the beginning .
76250	76387	76535	76537	Hall - face	206	' But thirdly are new tidings again : for three days ago , while some of the folk were hunting peaceably in the Wild - wood and thinking no evil , they were fallen upon of set purpose by a host of men - at - arms , and nought would serve but mere battle for dear life , so that many of our neighbours were hurt , and three slain outright ; and now mark this , that those who there fell upon our folk were clad and armed even as the two felons that slew Wood - grey , and moreover were like them in aspect of body . Now stand forth Hall - face my son , and answer to my questions in a loud voice , so that all may hear thee . '
76423	76462	76416	76418	Iron - face	205	' Tell me , son , those whom ye met in the wood , and of whom ye brought home two captives , how much like were they to the murder - carles at Wood - grey 's ? '
76468	76508	76464	76466	Hall - face	206	' As like as peas out of the same cod , and to our eyes all those whom we saw in the wood might have been sons of one father and one mother , so much alike were they . '
76509	76512	76514	76515	the Alderman	590	' Yea , '
76517	76533	76514	76515	the Alderman	590	' now tell me how many by thy deeming fell upon you in the wood ? '
76539	76556	76535	76537	Hall - face	206	' We deemed that if they were any less than threescore , they were little less . '
76557	76563	76565	76566	the Alderman	590	' Great was the odds , '
76568	76575	76565	76566	the Alderman	590	' Or how many were ye ? '
76576	76582	76584	76586	Hall - face	206	' One score and seven , '
76592	76604	76589	76590	the Alderman	590	' And yet ye escaped with life all save those three ? '
76610	76670	76605	76607	Hall - face	206	' I deem that scarce one should have come back alive , had it not been that as we fought came a noise like the howling of wolves , and thereat the foemen turned and fled , and there followed on the fleers tall men clad in sheep - brown raiment , who smote them down as they fled . '
76671	76680	76682	76683	the Alderman	590	' Here then is the story , neighbours , '
76685	76800	76682	76683	the Alderman	590	' and ye may see thereby that if those slayers of Wood - grey were outcast , their band is a great one ; but it seemeth rather that they were men of a folk whose craft it is to rob with the armed hand , and to slay the robbed ; and that they are now gathering on our borders for war . Yet , moreover , they have foemen in the woods who should be fellows - in - arms of us . How sayest thou , Stone - face ? Thou art old , and hast seen many wars in the Dale , and knowest the Wild - wood to its innermost .
76801	76804	76806	76808	Stone - face	206	' Alderman , '
76810	77077	76806	76808	Stone - face	206	' and ye neighbours of the Dale , maybe these foes whom ye have met are not of the race of man , but are trolls and wood - wights . Now if they be trolls it is ill , for then is the world growing worser , and the wood shall be right perilous for those who needs must fare therein . Yet if they be men it is a worse matter ; for the trolls would not come out of the waste into the sunlight of the Dale . But these foes , if they be men , are lusting after our fair Dale to eat it up , and it is most like that they are gathering a huge host to fall upon us at home . Such things I have heard of when I was young , and the aspect of the evil men who overran the kindreds of old time , according to all tales and lays that I have heard , is even such as the aspect of those whom we have seen of late . As to those wolves who saved the neighbours and chased their foemen , there is one here who belike knoweth more of all this than we do , and that , O Alderman , is thy son whom I have fostered , Face - of - god to wit . Bid him answer to thy questioning , and tell us what he hath seen and heard of late ; then shall we verily know the whole story as far as it can be known . '
77277	77294	77273	77274	the Alderman	590	' I would question my son Face - of - god . Let him stand forth ! '
77320	77332	77317	77317	he	590	' Ask of me , Alderman , and I will answer . '
77333	77336	77338	77340	Iron - face	205	' Kinsman , '
77342	77381	77338	77340	Iron - face	205	' look at these two dead men , and tell me , if thou hast seen any such besides those two murder - carles who were slain at Carlstead ; or if thou knowest aught of their folk ? '
77389	77424	77383	77383	Face	206	' Yesterday I saw six others like to these both in array and of body , and three of them I slew , for we were in battle with them early in the morning . '
77451	77460	77446	77446	Iron	205	' What meanest thou by " we " ? '
77461	77472	77474	77478	Face - of - god	206	' I and the men who had guested me overnight , '
77480	77498	77474	77478	Face - of - god	206	' and they slew the other three ; or rather a woman of them slew the felons . '
77499	77511	77513	77514	the Alderman	590	' Valiant she was ; all good go with her hand ! '
77516	77529	77513	77514	the Alderman	590	' But what be these people , and where do they dwell ? '
77537	77657	77531	77535	Face - of - god	206	' As to what they are , they are of the kindred of the Gods and the Fathers , valiant men , and guest - cherishing : rich have they been , and now are poor : and their poverty cometh of these same felons , who mastered them by numbers not to be withstood . As to where they dwell : when I say the name of their dwelling - place men mock at me , as if I named some valley in the moon : yet came I to Burgdale thence in one day across the mountain - necks led by sure guides , and I tell thee that the name of their abode is Shadowy Vale . '
77658	77661	77663	77665	Iron - face	205	' Yea , '
77667	77681	77663	77665	Iron - face	205	' knoweth any man here of Shadowy Vale , or where it is ? '
77736	77750	77733	77734	that elder	2506	' Give me place ; for I have a word to say hereon . '
77771	77778	77757	77757	his	2503	' Alderman , thou knowest me ? '
77779	77782	77784	77786	Iron - face	205	' Yea , '
77788	77822	77784	77786	Iron - face	205	' thou art called the Fiddle , because of thy sweet speech and thy minstrelsy ; whereof I mind me well in the time when I was young and thou no longer young . '
77823	77828	77830	77831	the Fiddle	2508	' So it is , '
77833	78162	77830	77831	the Fiddle	2508	' Now hearken ! When I was very young I heard of a vale lying far away across the mountain - necks ; a vale where the sun shone never in winter and scantily in summer ; for my sworn foster - brother , Fight - fain , a bold man and a great hunter , had happened upon it ; and on a day in full midsummer he brought me thither ; and even now I see the Vale before me as in a picture ; a marvellous place , well grassed , treeless , narrow , betwixt great cliff - walls of black stone , with a green river running through it towards a yawning gap and a huge force . Amidst that Vale was a doom- ring of black stones , and nigh thereto a feast - hall well builded of the like stones , over whose door was carven the image of a wolf with red gaping jaws , and within it for we entered into it were stone benches on the dais . Thence we came away , and thither again we went in late autumn , and so dusk and cold it was at that season , that we knew not what to call it save the valley of deep shade . But its real name we never knew ; for there was no man there to give us a name or tell us any tale thereof ; but all was waste there ; the wimbrel laughed across its water , the raven croaked from its crags , the eagle screamed over it , and the voices of its waters never ceased ; and thus we left it . So the seasons passed , and we went thither no more : for Fight - fain died , and without him wandering over the waste was irksome to me ; so never have I seen that valley again , or heard men tell thereof .
78163	78193	78194	78195	The Alderman	590	' Now , neighbours , have I told you of a valley which seemeth to be Shadowy Vale ; and this is true and no made - up story . '
78211	78226	78194	78195	The Alderman	590	' Kinsman , is this word according with what thou knowest of Shadowy Vale ? '
78227	78234	78236	78240	Face - of - god	206	' Yea , on all points , '
78242	78293	78236	78240	Face - of - god	206	' he hath put before me a picture of the valley . And whereas he saith , that in his youth it was waste , this also goeth with my knowledge thereof . For once was it peopled , and then was waste , and now again is it peopled . '
78294	78304	78306	78307	the Alderman	205	' Tell us then more of the folk thereof , '
78309	78314	78306	78307	the Alderman	205	' are they many ? '
78315	78318	78320	78324	Face - of - god	206	' Nay , '
78326	78624	78320	78324	Face - of - god	206	' they are not . How might they be many , dwelling in that narrow Vale amid the wastes ? But they are valiant , both men and women , and strong and well - liking . Once they dwelt in a fair dale called Silver - dale , the name whereof will be to you as a name in a lay ; and there were they wealthy and happy . Then fell upon them this murderous Folk , whom they call the Dusky Men ; and they fought and were overcome , and many of them were slain , and many enthralled , and the remnant of them escaped through the passes of the mountains and came back to dwell in Shadowy Vale , where their forefathers had dwelt long and long ago ; and this overthrow befell them ten years agone . But now their old foemen have broken out from Silver - dale and have taken to scouring the wood seeking prey ; so they fall upon these Dusky Men as occasion serves , and slay them without pity , as if they were adders or evil dragons ; and indeed they be worse . And these valiant men know for certain that their foemen are now of mind to fall upon this Dale and destroy it , as they have done with others nigher to them . And they will slay our men , and lie with our women against their will , and enthrall our children , and torment all those that lie under their hands till life shall be worse than death to them . Therefore , O Alderman and Wardens , and ye neighbours all , it behoveth you to take counsel what we shall do , and that speedily . '
78658	78672	78654	78655	the Alderman	205	' When didst thou first happen upon this Earl - folk , son ? '
78673	78678	78680	78684	Face - of - god	878	' Late last autumn , '
78691	78703	78687	78687	Iron	205	' Then mightest thou have told us of this tale before . '
78704	78707	78709	78710	his son	804	' Yea , '
78712	78988	78709	78710	his son	804	' but I knew it not , or but little of it , till two days agone . In the autumn I wandered in the woodland , and on the fell I happened on a few of this folk dwelling in a booth by the pine - wood ; and they were kind and guest - fain with me , and gave me meat and drink and lodging , and bade me come to Shadowy Vale in the spring , when I should know more of them . And that was I fain of ; for they are wise and goodly men . But I deemed no more of those that I saw there save as men who had been outlawed by their own folk for deeds that were unlawful belike , but not shameful , and were biding their time of return , and were living as they might meanwhile . But of the whole Folk and their foemen knew I no more than ye did , till two days agone , when I met them again in Shadowy Vale . Also I think before long ye shall see their chieftain in Burgstead , for he hath a word for us . Lastly , my mind it is that those brown - clad men who helped Hall - face and his company in the wood were nought but men of this Earl - kin seeking their foemen ; for indeed they told me that they had come upon a battle in the woodland wherein they had slain their foemen . Now have I told you all that ye need to know concerning these matters . '
79021	79042	79006	79011	a goodman of the Upper Dale	2515	' Gold - mane mine , tell us how many is this folk ; I mean their fighting - men ? '
79043	79049	79051	79053	Iron - face	205	' Well asked , neighbour , '
79062	79151	79056	79060	Face - of - god	878	' Their fighting - men of full age may be five score ; but besides that there shall be some two or three score of women that will fight , whoever says them nay ; and many of these are little worse in the field than men ; or no worse , for they shoot well in the bow . Moreover , there will be a full score of swains not yet twenty winters old whom ye may not hinder to fight if anything is a - doing . '
79152	79159	79161	79162	the Alderman	590	' This is no great host , '
79164	79240	79161	79162	the Alderman	590	' yet if they deem there is little to lose by fighting , and nought to gain by sitting still , they may go far in winning their desire ; and that more especially if they may draw into their quarrel some other valiant Folk more in number than they be . I marvel not , though , they were kind to thee , son Gold - mane , if they knew who thou wert . '
79241	79246	79248	79252	Face - of - god	206	' They knew it , '
79254	79257	79259	79260	the Alderman	590	' Neighbours , '
79262	79278	79259	79260	the Alderman	590	' have ye any rede hereon , and aught to say to back your rede ? '
79284	79443	79281	79282	the Fiddle	2508	' As ye know and may see , I am now very old , and , as the word goes , unmeet for battle : yet might I get me to the field , either on mine own legs or on the legs of some four - foot beast , I would strike , if it were but one stroke , on these pests of the earth . And , Alderman , meseemeth we shall do amiss if we bid not the Earl - folk of Shadowy Vale to be our fellows in arms in this adventure . For look you , how few soever they be , they will be sure to know the ways of our foemen , and the mountain passes , and the surest and nighest roads across the necks and the mires of the waste ; and though they be not a host , yet shall they be worth a host to us ? '
79531	79636	79528	79528	He	283	' Life hath been well with us of the Lower Dale , and we deem that we have much to lose in losing it . Yet ill would the bargain be to buy life with thralldom : we have been over - merry hitherto for that . Therefore I say , to battle ! And as to these men , these well - wishers of Face - of - god , if they also are minded for battle with our foes , we were fools indeed if we did not join them to our company , were they but one score instead of six . '
79760	79785	79754	79756	the Alderman spake	205	' As to the war , that must we needs meet if all be sooth that we have heard , and I doubt it not .
79786	79980	79754	79756	the Alderman spake	205	' Now therefore let us look to it like wise men while time yet serves . Ye shall know that the muster of the Dalesmen will bring under shield eight long hundreds of men well - armed , and of the Shepherd - Folk four hundreds , and of the Woodlanders two hundreds ; and this is a goodly host if it be well ordered and wisely led . Now am I your Alderman and your Doomster , and I can heave up a sword as well as another maybe , nor do I think that I shall blench in the battle ; yet I misdoubt me that I am no leader or orderer of men - of - war : therefore ye will do wisely to choose a wiser man - at - arms than I be for your War - leader ; and if at the Great Folk - mote , when all the Houses and Kindreds are gathered , men yeasay your choosing , then let him abide ; but if they naysay it , let him give place to another . For time presses . Will ye so choose ? '
79981	79986	79988	79989	all men	6587	' Yea , yea ! '
79991	79998	80000	80001	the Alderman	590	' Good is that , neighbours , '
80003	80016	80000	80001	the Alderman	590	' Whom will ye have for War - leader ? Consider well . '
80031	80038	80026	80026	his	2337	' Face - of - god ! '
80044	80118	80041	80042	the Alderman	590	' The man is young and untried ; yet though he is so near akin to me , I will say that ye will do wisely to take him ; for he is both deft of his hands and brisk ; and moreover , of this matter he knoweth more than all we together . Now therefore I declare him your War - leader till the time of the Great Folk - mote . '
80164	80227	80149	80149	them	6587	' Alderman , some of us deem it good that Stone - face , the old man wise in war and in the ways of the Wood , should be named as a counsellor to the War - leader ; and Hall - face , a very brisk and strong young man , to be his right hand and sword - bearer . '
80228	80233	80235	80237	Iron - face	205	' Good is that , '
80239	80248	80235	80237	Iron - face	205	' Neighbours , will ye have it so ? '
80283	80318	80280	80280	he	590	' If any hath aught to say concerning what is best to be done at once , it were good that he said it now before all and not to murmur and grudge hereafter . '
80328	80480	80322	80323	the Fiddle	2508	' Alderman and War - leader , one thing would I say : that if these foemen are anywise akin to those overrunners of the Folks of whom the tales went in my youth for I also as well as Stone - face mind me well of those tales concerning them , it shall not avail us to sit still and await their onset . For then may they not be withstood , when they have gathered head and burst out and over the folk that have been happy , even as the waters that overtop a dyke and cover with their muddy ruin the deep green grass and the flower - buds of spring . Therefore my rede is , as soon as may be to go seek these folk in the woodland and wheresoever else they may be wandering . What sayest thou , Face - of - god ? '
80481	80488	80490	80490	he	2542	' My rede is as thine , '
80492	80589	80490	80490	he	2542	' and to begin with , I do now call upon ten tens of good men to meet me in arms at the beginning of Wildlake 's Way to - morrow morning at daybreak ; and I bid my brother Hall - face to summon such as are most meet thereto . For this I deem good , that we scour the wood daily at present till we hear fresh tidings from them of Shadowy Vale , who are nigher than we to the foemen . Now , neighbours , are ye ready to meet me ? '
80594	80605	80591	80591	all	2344	' Yea , we will go , we will go ! '
80610	80698	80607	80608	the Alderman	590	' Now have we made provision for the war in that which is nearest to our hands . Yet have we to deal with the matter of the fellowship with the Folk whom Face - of - god hath seen . This is a matter for thee , son , at least till the Great Folk - mote is holden . Tell me then , shall we send a messenger to Shadowy Vale to speak with this folk , or shall we abide the chieftain 's coming ? '
80699	80704	80706	80710	Face - of - god	206	' By my rede , '
80712	80813	80706	80710	Face - of - god	206	' we shall abide his coming : for first , though I might well make my way thither , I doubt if I could give any the bearings , so that he could come there without me ; and belike I am needed at home , since I am become War - leader . Moreover , when your messenger cometh to Shadowy Vale , he may well chance to find neither the chieftain there , nor the best of his men ; for whiles are they here , and whiles there , as they wend following after the Dusky Men . '
80814	80821	80823	80824	the Alderman	590	' It is well , son , '
80826	80873	80823	80824	the Alderman	590	' let it be as thou sayest : soothly this matter must needs be brought before the Great Folk - mote . Now will I ask if any other hath any word to say , or any rede to give before this Gate - thing sundereth ? '
81153	81181	81150	81150	she	755	' There sittest thou , O Alderman of Burgdale ! Is Face - of - god thy son anywhere nigh , so that he can hear me ? '
81194	81205	81183	81185	Iron - face	205	' He is beside thee , as he should be . '
81236	81373	81222	81222	she	755	' Hearken , Iron - face ! Chief of the House of the Face , Alderman of the Dale , and ye also , neighbours and goodmen of the Dale : I am a woman called the Bride , of the House of the Steer , and ye have heard that I have plighted my troth to Face - of - god to we d with him , to love him , and lie in his bed . But it is not so : we are not troth - plight ; nor will I we d with him , nor any other , but will wend with you to the war , and play my part therein according to what might is in me ; nor will I be worser than the wives of Shadowy Vale . '
81409	81503	81404	81404	his	288	' Maiden , what are these words ? What have we done to thee ? Have I not been to thee as a father , and loved thee dearly ? Is not my son goodly and manly and deft in arms ? Hath it not ever been the wo nt of the House of the Face to we d in the House of the Steer ? and in these two Houses there hath never yet been a goodlier man and a lovelier maiden than are ye two . What have we done then ? '
81504	81512	81513	81513	she	2561	' Ye have done nought against me , '
81516	81538	81513	81513	she	2561	' and all that thou sayest is sooth ; yet will I not we d with Face - of - god . '
81556	81590	81549	81549	he	205	' But how if I tell thee that I will speak with thy kindred of the Steer , and thou shalt do after my bidding whether thou wilt or whether thou wilt not ? '
81591	81600	81601	81601	she	2561	' And how will ye compel me thereto ? '
81604	81641	81601	81601	she	2561	' Are there thralls in the Dale ? Or will ye make me an outlaw ? Who shall heed it ? Or I shall betake me to Shadowy Vale and become one of their warrior- maidens . '
81673	81715	81669	81669	he	590	' This is an evil day , and who shall help me ? Thou , Face - of - god , what hast thou to say ? Wilt thou let this woman go without a word ? What hath bewitched thee ? '
81753	81830	81738	81738	Iron	205	' Tell me , maiden , whom I erst called daughter , what hath befallen , that thou wilt leave my son ; thou who wert once so kind and loving to him ; whose hand was always seeking his , whose eyes were ever following his ; who wouldst go where he bade , and come when he called . What hath betid that ye have cast him out , and flee from our House ? '
81840	82203	81831	81831	She	755	' There is war in the land , and I have seen it coming , and that things shall change around us . I have looked about me and seen men happy and women content , and children weary for mere mirth and joy . And I have thought , in a day , or two days or three , all this shall be changed , and the women shall be , some anxious and wearied with waiting , some casting all hope away ; and the men , some shall come back to the garth no more , and some shall come back maimed and useless , and there shall be loss of friends and fellows , and mirth departed , and dull days and empty hours , and the children wandering about marvelling at the sorrow of the house . All this I saw before me , and grief and pain and wounding and death ; and I said : Shall I be any better than the worst of the folk that loveth me ? Nay , this shall never be ; and since I have learned to be deft with mine hands in all the play of war , and that I am as strong as many a man , and as hardy - hearted as any , I will give myself to the Warrior and the God of the Face ; and the battle - field shall be my home , and the after- grief of the fight my banquet and holiday , that I may bear the burden of my people , in the battle and out of it ; and know every sorrow that the Dale hath ; and cast aside as a grievous and ugly thing the bed of the warrior that the maiden desires , and the toying of lips and hands and soft words of desire , and all the joy that dwelleth in the Castle of Love and the Garden thereof ; while the world outside is sick and sorry , and the fields lie waste and the harvest burneth . Even so have I sworn , even so will I do . '
82246	82308	82240	82242	Iron - face	205	' These are great words ; but I know not what they mean . If thou wilt to the field and fight among the carles and that I would not naysay , for it hath oft been done and praised aforetime , why shouldest thou not go side by side with Face - of - god and as his plighted maiden ? '
82340	82371	82335	82335	she	2565	' I will not we d with Face - of - god , but will fare afield as a virgin of war , as I have sworn to the Warrior . '
82393	82415	82381	82381	he	205	' There is some lie abroad , that windeth about us as the gossamers in the lanes of an autumn morning . '
82453	82507	82439	82439	he	205	' Thou ! what hast thou done to turn this maiden 's heart to stone ? Who is it that is devising guile with thee to throw aside this worthy wedding in a worthy House , with whom our sons are ever wo nt to we d ? Speak , tell the tale ! '
82565	82627	82550	82550	he	205	' Thou dastard ! I see thee now ; it is thou that hast done this , and not the maiden ; and now thou hast made her bear a double burden , and set her on to speak for thee , whilst thou standest by saying nought , and wilt take no scruple 's weight of her shame upon thee ! '
82642	82682	82637	82639	Iron - face	205	' Out on thee ! I know thee now , and why thou wouldest not to the West - land last winter . I am no fool ; I know thee . Where hast thou hidden the stranger woman ? '
82736	82752	82754	82754	some	1353	' The Peace of the Holy Thing ! Peace - breaking , peace - breaking ! '
82757	82768	82754	82754	some	1353	' For the War - leader , the War- leader ! '
82907	82945	82884	82885	the Alderman	590	' Here hath been trouble in the Holy Thing ; a violent man hath troubled it , and drawn sword on a neighbour ; will the neighbours give the dooming hereof into the hands of the Alderman ? '
82958	82963	82954	82954	they	397	' That will we . '
82969	83008	82965	82965	he	205	' I doom the troubler of the Peace of the Holy Thing to pay a fine , to wit double the blood - wite that would be duly paid for a full - grown freeman of the kindreds . '
83047	83132	83039	83041	Stone - face	206	' Here have been wild words in the air ; and dreams have taken shape and come amongst us , and have bewitched us , so that friends and kin have wrangled . And meseemeth that this is through the wizardry of these felons , who , even dead as they are , have cast spells over us . Good it were to cast them into the Death Tarn , and then to get to our work ; for there is much to do . '
83166	83530	83160	83161	the Fiddle	291	' Stone - face sayeth sooth . O Alderman , thou art no young man , yet am I old enough to be thy father ; so will I give thee a rede , and say this : Face - of - god thy son is no liar or dastard or beguiler , but he is a young man and exceeding goodly of fashion , well - spoken and kind ; so that few women may look on him and hear him without desiring his kindness and love , and to such men as this many things happen . Moreover , he hath now become our captain , and is a deft warrior with his hands , and as I deem , a sober and careful leader of men ; therefore we need him and his courage and his skill of leading . So rage not against him as if he had done an ill deed not to be forgiven - whatever he hath done , whereof we know not - for life is long before him , and most like we shall still have to thank him for many good deeds towards us . As for the maiden , she is both lovely and wise . She hath a sorrow at her heart , and we deem that we know what it is . Yet hath she not lied when she said that she would bear the burden of the griefs of the people . Even so shall she do ; and whether she will , or whether she will not , that shall heal her own griefs . For to - morrow is a new day . Therefore , if thou do after my rede , thou wilt not meddle betwixt these twain , but wilt remember all that we have to do , and that war is coming upon us . And when that is over , we shall turn round and behold each other , and see that we are not wholly what we were before ; and then shall that which were hard to forgive , be forgotten , and that which is remembered be easy to forgive . '
83612	83798	83609	83609	she	755	' Thou hast been wroth with me , and I marvel not ; for thy hope , and the hope which we all had , hath deceived thee . But kind indeed hast thou been to me ere now : therefore I pray thee take it not amiss if I call to thy mind the oath which thou swearedst on the Holy Boar last Yule , that thou wouldst not gainsay the prayer of any man if thou couldest perform it ; therefore I bid thee naysay not mine : and that is , that thou wilt ask me no more about this matter , but wilt suffer me to fare afield like any swain of the Dale , and to deal so with my folk that they shall not hinder me . Also I pray thee that thou wilt put no shame upon Face - of - god my playmate and my kinsman , nor show thine anger to him openly , even if for a little while thy love for him be abated . No more than this will I ask of thee . '
83906	83954	83903	83903	he	205	' It is well , my daughter . I have no will to forswear myself ; nor hast thou asked me a thing which is over - hard . Yet indeed I would that to - day were yesterday , or that many days were worn away . '
83969	84042	83956	83956	he	205	' Let none forget the muster ; but hold him ready against the time that the Warden shall come to him . Let all men obey the War - leader , Face- of - god , without question or delay . As to the fine of the peace- breaker , it shall be laid on the altar of the God at the Great Folk- mote . Herewith is the Thing broken up . '
84553	84604	84548	84548	his	784	' Good is this if it may be done ; but it is not for everyone to go down to Hell in his lifetime and come back safe with a tale thereof . However , whither thou wilt lead , thither will I follow , though assured death waylayeth us . '
86079	86119	86068	86072	Face - of - god	206	' Come hither , Woodsman ! we will not harm thee , but we desire speech of thee : and it will not avail thee to flee , since I have bowmen of the best in the hollow yonder . '
86229	86243	86215	86219	Face - of - god	878	' Art thou a foemen ? or wilt thou be helpful to us ? '
86264	86277	86244	86244	He	669	' Thou seest , lord , that I am naked and unarmed . '
86278	86285	86287	86291	Face - of - god	878	' Yet may'st thou bewray us , '
86293	86299	86287	86291	Face - of - god	878	' What man art thou ? '
86304	86334	86301	86302	the man	669	' I am the runaway thrall of evil men ; I have fled from Rose - dale and the Dusky Men . Hast thou the heart to hurt me ? '
86335	86345	86347	86351	Face - of - God	202	' We are the foemen of the Dusky Men , '
86353	86361	86347	86351	Face - of - God	202	' wilt thou help us against them ? '
86370	86401	86362	86363	The man	669	' Yea , if ye will give me your word not to suffer me to fall into their hands alive . But whence art thou , to be so bold ? '
86409	86441	86403	86407	Face - of - god	202	' We are of Burgdale ; and I will swear to thee on the edge of the sword that thou shalt not fall alive into the hands of the Dusky Men . '
86442	86449	86451	86452	the man	669	' Of Burgdale have I heard , '
86454	86504	86451	86452	the man	669	' and in sooth thou seemest not such a man as would bewray a hapless man . But now had I best bring you to some lurking - place where ye shall not be easily found of these devils , who now oft - times scour the woods hereabout . '
86512	86535	86506	86510	Face - of - god	202	' Come first and see my fellows ; and then if thou thinkest we have need to hide , it is well . '
86569	86579	86581	86582	the man	669	' Sorely hast thou been mishandled , poor man ! '
86591	86627	86581	86582	the man	669	' Said I not that I had been a thrall of the Dusky Men ? how then should I have escaped tormenting and scourging , if I had been with them for but three days ? '
86655	86679	86651	86652	the man	669	' Are these thy fellows ? Call to mind that thou hast sworn by the edge of the sword not to hurt me . '
86680	86684	86686	86690	Face - of - god	878	' Poor man ! '
86692	86703	86686	86690	Face - of - god	878	' these are thy friends , unless thou bewrayest us . '
86712	86744	86705	86705	he	669	' Here is now a good hap ! this is a runaway thrall of the Dusky Men ; of him shall we hear tidings ; so cherish him all ye may . '
86827	86891	86816	86816	he	669	' Now I see so many men and weapons I deem that ye have no need to skulk in caves to - night , though I know of good ones : yet shall ye do well not to light a fire till moon - setting ; for the flame ye may lightly hide , but the smoke may be seen from far aloof . '
86942	86966	86928	86928	he	669	' If ye are from Burgdale ye shall be faring back again presently ; and I pray you to take me with you . '
86974	86990	86968	86972	Face - of - god	878	' Yea surely , friend , that will we do , and rejoice in thee . '
87007	87263	86997	86997	Warcliff	212	' Yet if ye would abide here till about noon to - morrow , or mayhappen a little later , I would bring other runaways to see you ; and them also might ye take with you : ye may think when ye see them that ye shall have small gain of their company ; for poor wretched folk they be , like to myself . Yet since ye seek for tidings , herein might they do you more service than I ; for amongst them are some who came out of the hapless Dale within this moon ; and it is six months since I escaped . Moreover , though they may look spent and outworn now , yet if ye give them a little rest , and feed them well , they shall yet do many a day 's work for you : and I tell you that if ye take them for thralls , and put collars on their necks , and use them no worse than a goodman useth his oxen and his asses , beating them not save when they are idle or at fault , it shall be to them as if they were come to heaven out of hell , and to such goodhap as they have not thought of , save in dreams , for many and many a day . And thus I entreat you to do because ye seem to me to be happy and merciful men , who will not begrudge us this happiness . '
87302	87363	87297	87299	Stone - face	206	' Herein , O War - leader , need I give thee no rede , for thou mayst see clearly that all we deem that we should lose our manhood and become the dastards of the Warrior if we did not abide the coming of these poor men , and take them back to the Dale , and cherish them . '
87364	87367	87369	87371	Wolf of Whitegarth	226	' Yea , '
87373	87437	87369	87371	Wolf of Whitegarth	226	' and great thanks we owe to this man that he biddeth us this : for great will be the gain to us if we become so like the Gods that we may deliver the poor from misery . Now must I needs think how they shall wonder when they come to Burgdale and find out how happy it is to dwell there . '
87438	87441	87443	87447	Face - of - god	206	' Surely , '
87449	87495	87443	87447	Face - of - god	206	' thus shall we do , whatever cometh of it . But , friend of the wood , as to thralls , there be none such in the Dale , but therein are all men friends and neighbours , and even so shall ye be . '
87582	87621	87574	87574	he	6853	' Since ye are in arms , and seem to be seeking your foemen , I suppose ye wot that these tyrants and man - quellers will fall upon you in Burgdale ere the summer is well worn . '
87622	87629	87631	87635	Face - of - god	206	' So much we deem indeed , '

87660	87934	87657	87658	the man	669	' It was six moons ago that I fled , as I have told you ; and even then it was the common talk amongst our masters that there were fair dales to the south which they would overrun . Man would say to man : We were over many in Silver - dale , and we needed more thralls , because those we had were lessening , and especially the women ; now are we more at ease in Rose - dale , though we have sent thralls to Silver - dale ; but yet we can bear no more men from thence to eat up our stock from us : let them fare south to the happy dales , and conquer them , and we will go with them and help therein , whether we come back to Rose - dale or no . Such talk did I hear then with mine own ears : but some of those whom I shall bring to you to - morrow shall know better what is doing , since they have fled from Rose - dale but a few days . Moreover , there is a man and a woman who have fled from Silver - dale itself , and are but a month from it , journeying all the time save when they must needs hide ; and these say that their masters have got to know the way to Burgdale , and are minded for it before the winter , as I said ; and nought else but the ways thither do they desire to know , since they have no fear . '
88122	88174	88120	88120	he	2731	' Lord , this is according to the naming of men in Rose - dale before we were enthralled : but now what names have thralls ? Also I am not altogether of the blood of them of Rose - dale , but of better and more warrior - like kin . '
88182	88194	88176	88180	Face - of - god	206	' Thou hast named Silver - dale ; knowest thou it ? '
88198	88253	88195	88195	Dallach	294	' I have never seen it . It is far hence ; in a week 's journey , making all diligence , and not being forced to hide and skulk like those runaways , ye shall come to the mouth thereof lying west , where its rock - walls fall off toward the plain . '
88254	88257	88259	88263	Face - of - god	206	' But , '
88265	88275	88259	88263	Face - of - god	206	' is there no other way into that Dale ? '
88276	88285	88287	88287	Dallach	294	' Nay , none that folk wot of , '
88289	88301	88287	88287	Dallach	294	' except to bold cragsmen with their lives in their hands . '
88302	88314	88316	88320	Face - of - god	206	' Knowest thou aught of the affairs of Silver - dale ? '
88325	88425	88323	88323	Dallach	294	' Somewhat I know : we wot that but a few years ago there was a valiant folk dwelling therein , who were lords of the whole dale , and that they were vanquished by the Dusky Men : but whether they were all slain and enthralled we wot not ; but we deem it otherwise . As for me it is of their blood that I am partly come ; for my father 's father came thence to settle in Rose - dale , and wedded a woman of the Dale , who was my father 's mother . '
88426	88438	88440	88444	Face - of - god	206	' When was it that ye fell under the Dusky Men ? '
88449	88469	88447	88447	Dallach	294	' It was five years ago . They came into the Dale a great company , all in arms . '
88470	88477	88479	88483	Face - of - god	206	' Was there battle betwixt you ? '
88485	88491	88493	88493	Dallach	294	' Alas ! not so , '
88495	88635	88493	88493	Dallach	294	' We were a happy folk there ; but soft and delicate : for the Dale is exceeding fertile , and beareth wealth in abundance , both corn and oil and wine and fruit , and of beasts for man 's service the best that may be . Would that there had been battle , and that I had died therein with those that had a heart to fight ; and even so saith now every man , yea , every woman in the Dale . But it was not so when the elders met in our Council - House on the day when the Dusky Men bade us pay them tribute and give them houses to dwell in and lands to live by . Then had we weapons in our hands , but no hearts to use them . '
88636	88641	88643	88646	the goodman of Whitegarth	2734	' What befell then ? '
88651	88906	88649	88649	Dallach	294	' Look ye to it , lords , that it befall not in Burgdale ! We gave them all they asked for , and deemed we had much left . What befell , sayst thou ? We sat quiet ; we went about our work in fear and trembling , for grim and hideous were they to look on . At first they meddled not much with us , save to take from our houses what they would of meat and drink , or raiment , or plenishing . And all this we deemed we might bear , and that we needed no more than to toil a little more each day so as to win somewhat more of wealth . But soon we found that it would not be so ; for they had no mind to till the teeming earth or work in the acres we had given them , or to sit at the loom , or hammer in the stithy , or do any manlike work ; it was we that must do all that for their behoof , and it was altogether for them that we laboured , and nought for ourselves ; and our bodies were only so much our own as they were needful to be kept alive for labour . Herein were our tasks harder than the toil of any mules or asses , save for the younger and goodlier of the women , whom they would keep fair and delicate to be their bed - thralls .
88907	89151	88649	88649	Dallach	294	' Yet not even so were our bodies safe from their malice : for these men were not only tyrants , but fools and madmen . Let alone that there were few days without stripes and torments to satiate their fury or their pleasure , so that in all streets and nigh any house might you hear wailing and screaming and groaning ; but moreover , though a wise man would not willingly slay his own thrall any more than his own horse or ox , yet did these men so wax in folly and malice , that they would often hew at man or woman as they met them in the way from mere grimness of soul ; and if they slew them it was well . Thereof indeed came quarrels enough betwixt master and master , for they are much given to man - slaying amongst themselves : but what profit to us thereof ? Nay , if the dead man were a chieftain , then woe betide the thralls ! for thereof must many an one be slain on his grave - mound to serve him on the hell - road . To be short : we have heard of men who be fierce , and men who be grim ; but these we may scarce believe us to be men at all , but trolls rather ; and ill will it be if their race waxeth in the world . '
89265	89339	89260	89260	Dallach	294	' Kind folk , ye will presently be sleeping ; but I bid you keep a good watch , and if ye will be ruled by me , ye will kindle no fire on the morrow , for the smoke riseth thick in the morning air , and is as a beacon . As for me , I shall leave you here to rest , and I myself will fare on mine errand . '
89373	89482	89370	89370	he	2730	' Nay , the moon is high , and it is as good as daylight to me , who could find my way even by starlight ; and your tarrying here is nowise safe . Moreover , if I could find those folk and bring them part of the way by night and cloud it were well ; for if we were taken again , burning quick would be the best death by which we should die . As for me , now am I strong with meat and drink and hope ; and when I come to Burgdale there will be time enough for resting and slumber . '
89490	89508	89484	89484	Face	206	' Shall I not wend with thee to see these people and the lairs wherein they hide ? '
89513	89518	89520	89520	he	669	' Nay , earl , '
89522	89703	89520	89520	he	669	' that shall not be . For wot ye what ? If they were to see me in company of a man - at - arms they would deem that I was bringing the foe upon them , and would flee , or mayhappen would fall upon us . For as for me , when I saw thee , thou wert close anigh me , so I knew thee to be no Dusky Man ; but they would see the glitter of thine arms from afar , and to them all weaponed men are foemen . Thou , lord , knowest not the heart of a thrall , nor the fear and doubt that is in it . Nay , I myself must cast off these clothes that ye have given me , and fare naked , lest they mistrust me . Only I will take a spear in my hand , and sling a knife round my neck , if ye will give them to me ; for if the worst happen , I will not be taken alive . '
90084	90114	90070	90070	He	206	' Now will they be lighting the cooking fires in Rose - dale : would I were there with a few hundreds of axes and staves at my back ! '

90257	90275	90251	90255	Face - of - god	206	' that may well be . But deemest thou by that token that we shall be vanquished ? '

90291	90362	90287	90289	Stone - face	206	' but thy friends of Shadowy Vale have been vanquished . Moreover , concerning these felons whom now we are hunting , are we all so sure that they be men ? Certain it is , that when I go into battle with them , I shall smite with no more pity than my sword , as if I were smiting things that may not feel the woes of man . '
90370	90430	90364	90368	Face - of - god	206	' Yea , even so shall it be with me . But what thinkest thou of these runaways ? Shall we have tidings of them , or shall Dallach bring the foe upon us ?

90431	90434	90436	90438	Stone - face	206	' Nay , '
90440	90496	90436	90438	Stone - face	206	' I have seen many men , and I deem of Dallach that he is a true man . I deem we shall soon have tidings of his fellows ; and they may have seen the elves and wood - wights : I would fain ask them thereof , and am eager to see them . '
90504	90595	90498	90502	Face - of - god	206	' And I somewhat dread to see them , and their rags and their misery and the weals of their stripes . It irked me to see Dallach when he first fell to his meat last night , how he ate like a dog for fear and famine . How shall it be , moreover , when we have them in the Dale , and they fall to the deed of kind there , as they needs must . Will they not bear us evil and thrall - like men ? '
90596	90599	90601	90603	Stone - face	206	' Maybe , '
90605	90711	90601	90603	Stone - face	206	' and maybe not ; for they have been thralls but for a little while : and I deem that in no long time shall ye see them much bettered by plenteous meat and rest . And after all is said , this Dallach bore him like a valiant man ; also it was valiant of him to flee ; and of the others may ye say the like . But look you ! there are men going down yonder towards our lair : belike those shall be our guests , and there be no Dusky Men amongst them . Come , let us home ! '

92265	92373	92253	92253	Dallach	294	' Lord of the Earl - folk , if I might give thee rede , it were best to turn your faces to Burgdale without more tarrying . For we are over- nigh to Rose - dale , being but thus many in company . But when we come to our next resting - place , then shall bring thee to speech with the last - comers from Silver - dale ; for there they talk with the tongue of the kindreds ; but we of Rose - dale for the more part talk otherwise ; though in my house it came down from father to son . '
92374	92377	92379	92383	Face - of - god	206	' Yea , '
92505	92586	92494	92494	himself	206	' We are now over - nigh to our foes of Rose - dale to lie here any longer , being too few to fall upon them . We will come hither again with a host when we have duly questioned these men who have sought refuge with us : and let us call yonder height the Burg of the Runaways , and it shall be a landmark for us when we are on the road to Rose - dale . '
94009	94758	93992	93992	She	904	' Thou hast sent for me , lord , and I wot well thou wouldst hear my tale shortly , for it would be long to tell if I were to tell it fully , and bring into it all that I have endured , which has been bitter enough , for all that ye see me smooth of skin and well - liking of body . I have been the bed - thrall of one of the chieftains of the Dusky Men , at whose house many of their great men would assemble , so that ye may ask me whatso ye will ; as I have heard much talk and may call it to mind . Now if ye ask me whether I have fled because of the shame that I , a free woman come of free folk , should be a mere thrall in the bed of the foes of my kin , and with no price paid for me , I must needs say it is not so ; since over long have we of the Dale been thralls to be ashamed of such a matter . And again , if ye deem that I have fled because I have been burdened with grievous toil and been driven thereto by the whip , ye may look on my hands and my body and ye will see that I have toiled little therewith : nor again did I flee because I could not endure a few stripes now and again ; for such usage do thralls look for , even when they are delicately kept for the sake of the fairness of their bodies , and this they may well endure ; yea also , and the mere fear of death by torment now and again . But before me lay death both assured and horrible ; so I took mine own counsel , and told none for fear of bewrayal , save him who guarded me ; and that was this man ; who fled not from fear , but from love of me , and to him I have given all that I might give . So we got out of the house and down the Dale by night and cloud , and hid for one whole day in the Dale itself , where I trembled and feared , so that I deemed I should die of fear ; but this man was well pleased with my company , and with the lack of toil and beating even for the day . And in the night again we fled and reached the wild - wood before dawn , and well- nigh fell into the hands of those who were hunting us , and had outgone us the day before , as we lay hid . Well , what is to say ? They saw us not , else had we not been here , but scattered piece - meal over the land . This carle knew the passes of the wood , because he had followed his master therein , who was a great hunter in the wastes , contrary to the wo nt of these men , and he had lain a night on the burg yonder ; therefore he brought me thither , because he knew that thereabout was plenty of prey easy to take , and he had a bow with him ; and there we fell in with others of our folk who had fled before , and with Dallach ; who e'en now told us what was hard to believe , that there was a fair young man like one of the Gods leading a band of goodly warriors , and seeking for us to bring us into a peaceful and happy land ; and this man would not have gone with him because he feared that he might fall into thralldom of other folk , who would take me away from him ; but for me , I said I would go in any case , for I was weary of the wood and its roughness and toil , and that if I had a new master he would scarcely be worse than my old one was at his best , and him I could endure . So I went , and glad and glad I am , whatever ye will do with me . And now will I answer whatso ye may ask of me . '
94843	94862	94840	94840	he	889	' I pray thee , sister , be truthful in thine answer , for somewhat lieth on it . '
94866	95069	94863	94863	She	2953	' How could I speak aught but the sooth to thee , O lovely lord ? The last word spoken hereof I mind me well : for my master had been mishandling me , and I was sullen to him after the smart , and he mocked and jeered me , and said : Ye women deem we can not do without you , but ye are fools , and know nothing ; we are going to conquer a new land where the women are plenty , and far fairer than ye be ; and we shall leave you to fare afield like the other thralls , or work in the digging of silver ; and belike ye wot what that meaneth . Also he said that they would leave us to the new tribe of their folk , far wilder than they , whom they looked for in the Dale in about a moon 's wearing ; so that they needs must seek to other lands . Also this same talk would we hear whenever it pleased any of them to mock us their bed - thralls . Now , my sweet lord , this is nought but the very sooth . '

95129	95216	95107	95107	she	2958	' This alone was it hard for me to tell thee amongst all the I griefs I have borne , whereof I might have told thee many tales , and will do one day if thou wilt suffer it ; but fear makes this hard for me . For in very sooth this was the cause of my fleeing , that my master was brought in slain by an arrow in the wood ; and he was to be borne to bale and burned in three days '

97290	97424	97275	97275	she	755	' Daughter , thou sayest who clad these folk thus ? It was misery that hath so dight them ; and they are the images of what we shall be if we love foul life better than fair death , and so fall into the hands of the Felons , who were the masters of these men . As for the tall naked men , they are of our own blood , and kinsmen to Face - of - god 's new friends ; and they are of the best of the vanquished : it was in early days that they fled from thralldom ; as we may have to do .

And since I am War - leader , and have the right hereto , I will first choose them whom I will lead into the House of the Face . And lo you ! will I have this man and he laid his hand on Dallach , who is he whom I first came across , and who found us all these others , and next I will have yonder tall carles , the three of them , because I perceive them to be men meet to be with a War- leader , and to follow him in battle .

And this we may not suffer , but must abide till we have met all our foemen and have overcome them , so that the poor folk there shall be safe from them till they have learned how to defend their dale . Now my rede is , that we send out the War- arrow at once up and down the Dale , and to the Shepherds and Woodlanders , and appoint a day for the Muster and Weapon - show of all our Folk , and that day to be the day before the Spring Market , that is to say , four days before the Great Folk - mote , and meantime that we keep sure watch about the border of the wood , and now and again scour the wood , so as to clear the Dale of their wandering bands .

What sayest thou , Face - of - god , my son ? '

'
107753	107780	107750	107751	the man	669	' They are tall men gloriously attired , so that they seem like kinsmen of the Gods ; and they bear flowering boughs in their hands . '

108123	108183	108116	108117	the Alderman	590	' And hail to thee , tall man ! Fair greeting to thee and thy company ! Wilt thou name thyself with thine own name , or shall I call thee nought save Guest ? Welcome art thou , by whatsoever name thou wilt be called . Here may'st thou and thy folk abide as long as ye will . '
108190	108379	108185	108188	the new - comer	6741	' Thanks have thou for thy greeting and for thy bidding ! And that bidding shall we take , whatsoever may come of it ; for we are minded to abide with thee for a while . But know thou , O Alderman of the Dalesmen , that I am not sackless toward thee and thine . My name is Folk - might of the Children of the Wolf , and this woman is the Sun - beam , my sister , and these behind me are of my kindred , and are well beloved and trusty . We are no evil men or wrong - doers ; yet have we been driven into sore straits , wherein men must needs at whiles do deeds that make their friends few and their foes many . So it may be that I am thy foeman . Yet , if thou doubtest of me that I shall be a baneful guest , thou shalt have our weapons of us , and then mayest thou do thy will upon us without dread ; and here first of all is my sword ! '
108427	108535	108418	108419	the Alderman	590	' The blade is a good one , and I say it who know the craft of sword- forging ; but I need it not , for thou seest I have a sword by my side . Keep your weapons , one and all ; for ye have come amongst many and those no weaklings : and if so be that thy guilt against us is so great that we must needs fall on you , ye will need all your war - gear . But hereof is no need to speak till the time of the Folk - mote , which will be holden in three days '
108583	108583	108572	108572	thou	3584	'
108596	108627	108585	108585	he	3586	' Yet belike thou hast a word of greeting for my son , Face - of - god , unless it be so that ye have not seen him before ? '
108713	108752	108706	108710	Face - of - god	878	' Welcome , Guests , who erewhile guested me so well : now beginneth the day of your well - doing to the men of Burgdale ; therefore will we do to you as well as we may . '
108826	108897	108898	108898	she	224	' Now it gladdens my heart to look upon thee alive and thriving , and to remember that day last winter when I met thee on the snow , and turned thee back from the perilous path to thy pleasure , which the Dusky Men were besetting , of whom thou knewest nought . Yea , it was merry that tide ; but this is better . Nay , friend , '
108901	109045	108898	108898	she	224	' it availeth thee nought to strive to look out of the back of thine head : let it be enough to thee that she is there . Thou art now become a great chieftain , and she is no less ; and this is a meeting of chieftains , and the folk are looking on and expecting demeanour of them as of the Gods ; and she is not to be dealt with as if she were the daughter of some little goodman with whom one hath made tryst in the meadows . There ! hearken to me for a while ; at least till I tell thee that thou seemest to me to hold thine head higher than when last I saw thee ; though that is no long time either . Hast thou been in battle again since that day ? '
109046	109049	109050	109050	he	3596	' Nay , '
109053	109082	109050	109050	he	3596	' I have stricken no stroke since I slew two felons within the same hour that we parted . And thou , sister , what hast thou done ? '
109086	109108	109083	109083	She	3597	' The grey goose hath been on the wing thrice since that , bearing on it the bane of evil things . '
109115	109132	109111	109111	Wood	221	' Kinswoman , tell him of that battle , since thou art deft with thy tongue . '
109136	109318	109133	109133	She	3597	' Weary on battles ! it is nought save this : twelve days agone needs must every fighting - man of the Wolf , carle or of queen , wend away from Shadowy Vale , while those unmeet for battle we hid away in the caves at the nether end of the Dale : but Sun - beam would not endure that night , and fared with us , though she handled no weapon . All this we had to do because we had learned that a great company of the Dusky Men were over - nigh to our Dale , and needs must we fall upon them , lest they should learn too much , and spread the story . Well , so wise was Folk - might that we came on them unawares by night and cloud at the edge of the Pine - wood , and but one of our men was slain , and of them not one escaped ; and when the fight was over we counted four score and ten of their arm - rings . '
109322	109337	109319	109319	He	3598	' Did that or aught else come of our meeting with them that morning ? '
109338	109341	109342	109342	she	3599	' Nay , '
109345	109409	109342	109342	she	3599	' nought came of it : those we slew were but a straying band . Nay , the four score and ten slain in the Pine - wood knew not of Shadowy Vale belike , and had no intent for it : they were but scouring the wood seeking their warriors that had gone out from Silver - dale and came not aback . '
109410	109421	109423	109427	Face - of - god	264	' Thou art wise in war , Bow - may , '
109441	109489	109434	109436	Bow - may	224	' Friend Gold - mane , dost thou perchance deem that there is aught ill in my warring ? And the Sun - beam , she naysayeth the bearing of weapons ; though I deem that she hath little fear of them when they come her way . '
109497	109534	109491	109495	Face - of - god	878	' Nay , I deem no ill of it , but much good . For I suppose that thou hast learned overmuch of the wo nt of the Dusky Men , and hast seen their thralls ? '
109557	109717	109554	109554	she	3601	' Yea , thou hast it ; for I have both seen their thralls and been in the Dale of thralldom ; and how then can I do less than I do ? But for thee , I perceive that thou hast been nigh unto our foes and hast fallen in with their thralls ; and that is well ; for whatso tales we had told thee thereof it is like thou wouldst not have trowed in , as now thou must do , since thou thyself hast seen these poor folk . But now I will tell thee , Gold- mane , that my soul is sick of these comings and goings for the slaughter of a few wretches ; and I long for the Great Day of Battle , when it will be seen whether we shall live or die ; and though I laugh and jest , yet doth the wearing of the days wear me . '
109726	109815	109718	109718	He	3602	' I am War - leader of this Folk , and trust me that the waiting - tide shall not be long ; wherefore now , sister , be merry to - day , for that is but meet and right ; and cast aside thy care , for presently shalt thou behold many new friends . But now meseemeth overlong have ye been standing before our Gate , and it is time that ye should see the inside of our Burg and the inside of our House . '
110063	110161	110060	110060	he	3607	' Alderman , meseemeth it is now time that we bring our Guests into the House of our Fathers ; for since they are in warlike array , and we are no longer living in peace , and I am now War - leader of the Dale , I deem it but meet that I should have the guesting of them . Moreover , when we are come into our House , I will bid thee look into thy treasury , that thou may'st find therein somewhat which it may pleasure us to give to our Guests . '
110167	110315	110163	110165	Iron - face	205	' Thou sayest well , son , and since the day is now worn past noon , and these folk are but just come from the Waste , therefore such as we have of meat and drink abideth them . And surely there is within our house a coffer which belongeth to thee and me ; and forsooth I know not why we keep the treasures hoarded therein , save that it be for this cause : that if we were to give to our friends that which we ourselves use and love , which would be of all things pleasant to us , if we gave them such goods , they would be worn and worsened by our use of them . For this reason , therefore , do we keep fair things which we use not , so that we may give them to our friends .
110316	110372	110406	110407	the Chapman	310	' Now , Guests , both of the Waste and the Westland , since here is no Gate - thing or meeting of the Dale - wardens , and we sit here but for our pleasure , let us go take our pleasure within doors for a while , if it seem good to you . '
111143	111265	111123	111124	the Alderman	590	' Men of the Dale , and ye Outlanders who may be here , know that this is a happy day ; for hither have come to us Guests , men of the kindred of the Gods , and they are even those of whom Face - of - god my son hath told you . And they are friends of our friends and foes of our foes . These men are now in my House , as is but right ; but when they come forth I look to you to cherish them in the best way ye know , and make much of them , as of those who may help us and who may by us be holpen . '
111631	111662	111622	111623	the Alderman	590	' Is it not so , Guests , that ye would now gladly behold our market , and the goodly wares which the chapmen have brought us from the Cities ? '
111669	111674	111664	111665	most men	492	' Yea , yea ! '
111681	111777	111676	111678	Iron - face	205	' Then shall ye go , nor be holden by me from your pleasure . And ye kinsmen who are the most guest - fain and the wisest , go ye with our friends , and make all things easy and happy for them . But first of all , Guests , I were well pleased if ye would take some small matters out of our abundance ; for it were well that ye see them ere ye stand before the chapmen 's booths , lest ye chaffer with them for what ye have already . '
111836	111948	111826	111830	Face - of - god	878	' Kinsman , if thou hast anywhere a hauberk somewhat better than folk are wo nt to bear , such as thine own hand fashioneth , and a sword of the like stuff , I would have thee give them , the sword to my brother- in - arms Wood - wise here , and the war - coat to my sister Bow - may , who shooteth so well in the bow that none may shoot closer , and very few as close ; and her shaft it was that delivered me when my skull was amongst the axes of the Dusky Men : else had I not been here . '
111982	112070	111974	111975	the Alderman	590	' I thank thee , son , that thou hast let me know what these our two friends may be fain of : and as for this damsel - at - arms , it is a little thing that thou askest for her , and we might have found her something more worthy of her goodliness ; yet forsooth , since we are all bound for the place where shafts and staves shall be good cheap , a greater treasure might be of less avail to her . '
112226	112340	112215	112215	he	590	' Sun - beam , thou fair woman , time has been when thou wert to us as the edge of the poisonous sword or the midnight torch of the murderer ; but now I know not how it will be , or if the grief which thou hast given me will ever wear out or not . And now that I have beheld thee , I have little to do to blame my son ; for indeed when I look on thee I can not deem that there is any evil in thee . Yea , however it may be , take thou this gift as the reward of thine exceeding beauty . '
112353	112454	112341	112341	She	3723	' Indeed , if I have hurt thee unwittingly , I grieve to have hurt so good a man . Hereafter belike we may talk more of this , but now I will but say , that whereas at first I needed but to win thy son 's goodwill , so that our Folk might come to life and thriving again , now it is come to this , that he holdeth my heart in his hand and may do what he will with it ; therefore I pray thee withhold not thy love either from him or from me . '
112464	112532	112455	112455	He	3725	' Thou art such an one as might make the old man young , and the boy grow into manhood suddenly ; and thy voice is as sweet as the voice of the song - birds singing in the dawn of early summer soundeth to him who hath been sick unto death , but who hath escaped it and is mending . And yet I fear thee . '
112587	112648	112582	112582	he	3725	' Fair damsel - at - arms , faithful is thy face , and the fashion of thee is goodly : now art thou become one of the best of our friends , and this is little enough to give thee ; yet would we fain ward thy body against the foeman ; so grieve us not by gainsaying us . '
113087	113199	113083	113084	the Alderman	205	' My son , I said not to thee come back presently , because I wotted that thou wouldst surely do so , knowing that we have much to speak of . For , whatever these thy friends may have done , or whatsoever thou hast done with them to grieve us , all that must be set aside at this present time , since the matter in hand is to save the Dale and its folk . What sayest thou hereon ? Since , young as thou mayst be , thou art our War - leader , and doubtless shalt so be after the Folk - mote hath been holden . '
113278	113309	113265	113265	he	206	' There can be no two words concerning what we have to aim at ; these Dusky Men we must slay everyone , though we be fewer than they be . '
113338	113384	113334	113336	Folk - might	7596	' Thou wert a boy methought when I cast my spear at thee last autumn , Face - of - god , but now hast thou grown into a man . Now tell me , what deemest thou we must do to slay them all ? '
113392	113415	113386	113390	Face - of - god	206	' Once again it is clear that we must fall upon them at home in Rose - dale and Silver - dale . '
113428	113504	113423	113425	Iron - face	205	' Needeth this ? May we not ward the Dale and send many bands into the wood to fall upon them when we meet them ? Yea , and so doing these our guests have already slain many , as this valiant man hath told me e'en now . Will ye not slay so many at last , that they shall learn to fear us , and abide at home and leave us at peace ? '
113513	113744	113506	113510	Face - of - god	206	' Meseemeth , father , that this is not thy rede , and that thou sayest this but to try me : and perchance ye have been talking about me when I was without in the street e'en now . Even if it might be that we should thus cow these felons into abiding at home and tormenting their own thralls at their ease , yet how then are our friends of the Wolf holpen to their own again ? And I shall tell thee that I have promised to this man and this woman that I will give them no less than a man 's help in this matter . Moreover , I have spoken in every house of the Dale , and to the Shepherds and the Woodlanders , and there is no man amongst them but will follow me in the quarrel . Furthermore , they have heard of the thralldom that is done on men no great way from their own houses ; yea , they have seen it ; and they remember the old saw , " Grief in thy neighbour 's hall is grief in thy garth , " and sure it is , father , that whether thou or I gainsay them , go they will to deliver the thralls of the Dusky Men , and will leave us alone in the Dale . '
113745	113753	113755	113758	the Dale - warden	3761	' This is no less than sooth , '
113760	113784	113755	113758	the Dale - warden	3761	' never have men gone forth more joyously to a merry - making than all men of us shall wend to this war . '
113785	113788	113790	113794	Face - of - god	206	' But , '
113796	113927	113790	113794	Face - of - god	206	' of one thing ye may be sure , that these men will not abide our pleasure till we cut them all off in scattered bands , nor will they sit deedless at home . Nor indeed may they ; for we have heard from their thralls that they look to have fresh tribes of them come to hand to eat their meat and waste their servants , and these and they must find new abodes and new thralls ; and they are now warned by the overthrows and slayings that they have had at our hands that we are astir , and they will not delay long , but will fall upon us with all their host ; it might even be to - day or to - morrow . '
113933	114092	113929	113931	Folk - might	7596	' In all this thou sayest sooth , brother of the Dale ; and to cut this matter short , I will tell you all , that yesterday we had with us a runaway from Silver - dale it is overlong to tell how we fell in with her ; for it was a woman . But she told us that this very moon is a new tribe come into the Dale , six long hundreds in number , and twice as many more are looked for in two eights of days , and that ere this moon hath waned , that is , in twenty - four days , they will wend their ways straight for Burgdale , for they know the ways thereto . So I say that Face - of - god is right in all wise . But tell me , brother , hast thou thought of how we shall come upon these men ? '
114093	114103	114105	114109	Face - of - god	206	' How many men wilt thou lead into battle ? '
114119	114133	114111	114113	Folk - might	7596	' A few , a few ; maybe two - hundreds all told . '
114134	114137	114139	114143	Face - of - god	206	' Yea , '
114145	114156	114139	114143	Face - of - god	206	' but some special gain wilt thou be to us . '
114157	114164	114166	114168	Folk - might	7596	' So I deem at least , '
114177	114245	114171	114175	Face - of - god	206	' Good is that . Now have we held our Weapon - show in the Dale , and we find that we together with you be sixteen long hundreds of men ; and the tale of the foemen that be now in Silver- dale , new - comers and all , shall be three thousands or thereabout , and in Rose - dale hard on a thousand . '
114246	114251	114253	114255	Folk - might	7596	' Scarce so many , '
114257	114297	114253	114255	Folk - might	7596	' some of the felons have died ; we told over our silver arm - rings yesterday , and the tale was three hundred and eighty and six . Besides , they were never so many as thou deemest . '
114298	114301	114303	114307	Face - of - god	206	' Well , '
114309	114352	114303	114307	Face - of - god	206	' yet at least they shall outnumber us sorely . We may scarce leave the Dale unguarded when our host is gone ; therefore I deem that we shall have but one thousand of men for our onslaught on Silver - dale . '
114353	114360	114362	114362	Stone	206	' How come ye to that ? '
114373	114526	114367	114371	Face - of - god	206	' Abide a while , fosterer ! Though the odds between us be great , it is not to be hidden that I wot how ye of the Wolf know of privy passes into Silver - dale ; yea , into the heart thereof ; and this is the special gain ye have to give us . Therefore we , the thousand men , falling on the foe unawares , shall make a great slaughter of them ; and if the murder be but grim enough , those thralls of theirs shall fear us and not them , as already they hate them and not us , so that we may look to them for rooting out these sorry weeds after the overthrow . And what with one thing , what with another , we may cherish a good hope of clearing Silver - dale at one stroke with the said thousand men .
114527	114722	114367	114371	Face - of - god	206	' There remaineth Rose - dale , which will be easier to deal with , because the Dusky Men therein are fewer and the thralls as many : that also would I fall on at the same time as we fall on Silver - dale with the men that are left over from the Silver - dale onslaught . Wherefore my rede is , that we gather all those unmeet for battle in the field into this Burg , with ten tens of men to strengthen them ; which shall be enough for them , along with the old men , and lads , and sturdy women , to defend themselves till help comes , if aught of evil befall , or to flee into the mountains , or at the worst to die valiantly . Then let the other five hundreds fare up to Rose - dale , and fall on the Dusky Men therein about the same time , but not before our onslaught on Silver - dale : thus shall hand help foot , so that stumbling be not falling ; and we may well hope that our rede shall thrive . '
114781	114880	114778	114778	he	3766	' War - leader of Burgdale , all that thou hast spoken likes me well , and even so must it be done , saving that parting of our host and sending one part to fall upon Rose - dale . I say , nay ; let us put all our might into that one stroke on Silver - dale , and then we are undone indeed if we fail ; but so shall we be if we fail anywise ; but if we win Silver - dale , then shall Rose - dale lie open before us . '
114881	114885	114887	114891	Face - of - god	206	' My brother , '
114893	114987	114887	114891	Face - of - god	206	' thou art a tried warrior , and I but a lad : but dost thou not see this , that whatever we do , we shall not at one onslaught slay all the Dusky Men of Silver - dale , and those that flee before us shall betake them to Rose - dale , and tell all the tale , and what shall hinder them then from falling on Burgdale since they are no great way from it after they have murdered what they will of the unhappy people under their hands ? '
114993	115056	114989	114991	Folk - might	7596	' I say not but that there is a risk thereof , but in war we must needs run such risks , and all should be risked rather than that our blow on Silver - dale be light . For we be the fewer ; and if the foemen have time to call that to mind , then are we all lost . '
115062	115156	115058	115058	Stone	206	' Meseemeth , War - leader , that there is nought much to dread in leaving Rose - dale to itself for a while ; for not only may we follow hard on the fleers if they flee to Rose - dale , and be there no long time after them , before they have time to stir their host but also after the overthrow we shall be free to send men back to Burgdale by way of Shadowy Vale . I deem that herein Folk - might hath the right of it . '
115157	115163	115165	115166	the Alderman	590	' Even so say I , '
115168	115205	115165	115166	the Alderman	590	' besides , we might theft leave more folk behind us for the warding of the Dale . So , son , the risk whereof thou speakest groweth the lesser the longer it is looked on . '
115213	115301	115208	115211	the Dale - warden	3761	' Yet saving your wisdom , Alderman , the risk is there yet . For if these felons come into the Dale at all , even if the folk left behind hold the Burg and keep themselves unmurdered , yet may they not hinder the foe from spoiling our homesteads ; so that our folk coming back in triumph shall find ruin at home , and spend weary days in hunting their foemen , who shall , many of them , escape into the Wild - wood . '
115302	115305	115307	115310	the Sun - beam	7698	' Yea , '
115312	115421	115307	115310	the Sun - beam	7698	' sooth is that ; and Face - of - god is wise to think of it and of other matters . Yet one thing we must bear in mind , that all may not go smoothly in our day 's work in Silver - dale ; so we must have force there to fall back on , in case we miss our stroke at first . Therefore , I say , send we no man to Rose - dale , and leave we no able man - at - arms behind in the Burg , so that we have with us every blade that may be gathered . '
115429	115499	115422	115424	Iron - face	205	' Thou art wise , damsel ; and I marvel that so fair - fashioned a thing as thou can think so hardly of the meeting of the fallow blades . But hearken ! will not the Dusky Men hear that we have stripped the Dale of fighting - men , and may they not then give our host the go - by and send folk to ruin us ? '
115525	115853	115517	115517	he	878	' Folk - might was right when he said that all must be risked . Let us leave Rose - dale till we have overcome them of Silver - dale . Moreover , my father , thou must not deem of these felons as if they were of like wits to us , to forecast the deeds to come , and weigh the chances nicely , and unravel tangled clews . Rather they move like to the stares in autumn , or the winter wild - geese , and will all be thrust forward by some sting that entereth into their imaginations . Therefore , if they have appointed one moon to wear before they fall upon us , they will not stir till then , and we have time enough to do what must be done . Wherefore am I now of one mind with the rest of you . Now meseemeth it were well that these things which we have spoken here , and shall speak , should not be noised abroad openly ; nay , at the Folk - mote it would be well that nought be said about the day or the way of our onslaught on Silver - dale , lest the foe take warning and be on their guard . Though , sooth to say , did I deem that if they had word of our intent they of Rose - dale would join themselves to them of Silver - dale , and that we should thus have all our foes in one net , then were I fain if the word would reach them . For my soul loathes the hunting that shall befall up and down the wood for the slaying of a man here , and two or three there , and the wearing of the days in wandering up and down with weapons in the hand , and the spinning out of hatred and delaying of peace . '
115874	115906	115859	115859	his	205	' Hail to thee , son , for thy word ! Herein thou speakest as if from my very soul , and fain am I of such a War - leader . '
115934	115989	115931	115931	he	205	' All hath been spoken that the others of us may speak ; and now it falleth to the part of Folk - might to order our goings for the tryst for the onslaught , and the trysting - place shall be in Shadowy Vale . How sayest thou , Chief of the Wolf ? '
115995	116108	115991	115993	Folk - might	7596	' I have little to say ; and it is for the War - leader to see to this closely and piecemeal . I deem , as we all deem , that there should be no delay ; yet were it best to wend not all together to Shadowy Vale , but in divers bands , as soon as ye may after the Folk - mote , by the sure and nigh ways that we shall show you . And when we are gathered there , short is the rede , for all is ready there to wend by the passes which we know throughly , and whereby it is but two days '
116133	116133	115991	115993	Folk - might	7596	'
116202	116286	116198	116198	he	3781	' Now therefore , War - leader , it is for thee to order the goings of thy folk . But I will tell thee that they shall not need to take aught with them save their weapons and victual for the way , that is , for thirty hours ; because all is ready for them in Shadowy Vale , though it be but a poor place as to victual . Canst thou tell us , therefore , what thou wilt do ? '
116327	116719	116309	116309	he	3781	' This is the order whereof I have bethought me . Before the Folk - mote I and the Wardens shall speak to the leaders of hundreds , who be mostly here at the Fair , and give them the day and the hour whereon they shall , each hundred , take their weapons and wend to Shadowy Vale , and also the place where they shall meet the men of yours who shall lead them across the Waste . These hundred - leaders shall then go straightway and give the word to the captains of scores , and the captains of scores to the captains of tens ; and if , as is scarce doubtful , the Folk - mote yea - says the onslaught and the fellowship with you of the Wolf , then shall those leaders of tens bring their men to the trysting - place , and so go their ways to Shadowy Vale . Now here I have the roll of our Weapon - show , and I will look to it that none shall be passed over ; and if ye ask me in what order they had best get on the way , my rede is that a two hundred should depart on the very evening of the day of the Folk - mote , and these to be of our folk of the Upper Dale ; and on the morning of the morrow of the Folk- mote another two hundreds from the Dale ; and in the evening of the same day the folk of the Shepherds , three hundreds or more , and that will be easy to them ; again on the next day two more bands of the Lower Dale , one in the morning , one in the evening . Lastly , in the earliest dawn of the third day from the Folk - mote shall the Woodlanders wend their ways . But one hundred of men let us leave behind for the warding of the Burg , even as we agreed before . As for the place of tryst for the faring over the Waste , let it be the end of the knolls just by the jaws of the pass yonder , where the Weltering Water comes into the Dale from the East . How say ye ? '
116761	116796	116798	116798	he	3761	' It were good , brother , that we saw the other wardens as soon as may be , to do them to wit of this order , and what they have to do . '
117231	117262	117216	117217	the damsels	3801	' treasure , Soft are ye by seeming , yet hardy of heart ! No warrior amongst us withstandeth your pleasure ; No man from his meadow may thrust you apart .
118418	118466	118405	118405	he	7596	' Time presses on me these days ; but if thou wouldest speak with me to - morrow as I would with thee , then mightest thou go on the Bridge of the Burg about sunrise , and I will be there , and we two only . '
118505	118520	118490	118490	she	3869	' Yea , friend , I shall be there , and fain of thee . '
119039	119058	119036	119036	he	8444	' Hereby is a fair place for us to sit and talk till the day 's work beginneth . '
119191	119319	119184	119184	she	755	' Gold - mane , my dear , sorely I wonder at thee and at me , how we are changed since that day last autumn when I first saw thee . Whiles I think , didst thou not laugh when thou wert by thyself that day , and mock at me privily , that I must needs take such wisdom on myself , and lesson thee standing like a stripling before me . Dost thou not call it all to mind and make merry over it , now that thou art become a great chieftain and a wise warrior , and I am yet what I always was , a young maiden of the kindred ; save that now I abide no longer for my love ? '
119364	119489	119361	119361	he	3900	' Yea , indeed , oft do I see that morning in the woodland hall and thee and me therein , as one looketh on a picture ; yea verily , and I laugh , yet is it for very bliss ; neither do I mock at all . Did I not deem thee a God then ? and am I not most happy now when I can call it thus to mind ? And as to thee , thou wert wise then , and yet art thou wise now . Yea , I thought thee a God ; and if we are changed , is it not rather that thou hast lifted me up to thee , and not come down to me ? '
119500	119622	119492	119492	he	3901	' Yet thou hast not to tell me that all thy love for thy Folk , and thy yearning hope for its recoverance , was but a painted show . Else why shouldst thou love me the better now that I am become a chieftain , and therefore am more meet to understand thy hope and thy sorrow ? Did I not behold thee as we stood before the Wolf of the Hall of Shadowy Vale , how the tears stood in thine eyes as thou beheldest him , and thine hand in mine quivered and clung to me , and thou wert all changed in a moment of time ? Was all this then but a seeming and a beguilement ? '
119623	119628	119629	119629	she	3902	' O young man , '
119632	119809	119629	119629	she	3902	' hast thou not said it , that we stood there close together , and my hand in thine and desire growing up in me ? Dost thou not know how this also quickeneth the story of our Folk , and our goodwill towards the living , and remembrance of the dead ? Shall they have lived and desired , and we deny desire and life ? Or tell me : what was it made thee so chieftain - like in the Hall yesterday , so that thou wert the master of all our wills , for as self - willed as some of us were ? Was it not that I , whom thou deemest lovely , was thereby watching thee and rejoicing in thee ? Did not the sweetness of thy love quicken thee ? Yet because of that was thy warrior 's wisdom and thy foresight an empty show ? Heedest thou nought the Folk of the Dale ? Wouldest thou sunder from the children of the Fathers , and dwell amongst strangers ? '
119820	119845	119810	119810	He	3903	' Did I not say of thee that thou wert wiser than the daughters of men ? See how wise thou hast made me ! '
119850	119900	119846	119846	She	3904	' Nay , nay , there was no feigning in my love for my people . How couldest thou think it , when the Fathers and the kindred have made this body that thou lovest , and the voice of their songs is in the speech thou deemest sweet ? '
119904	119954	119901	119901	He	3903	' Sweet friend , I deemed not that there was feigning in thee : I was but wondering what I am and how I was fashioned , that I should make thee so glad that thou couldst for a while forget thy hope of the days before we met . '
119958	120016	119955	119955	She	3905	' O how glad , how glad ! Yet was I nought hapless . In despite of all trouble I had no down - weighing grief , and I had the hope of my people before me . Good were my days ; but I knew not till now how glad a child of man may be . '
120032	120113	120029	120029	she	3905	' Gold - mane , my friend , I mocked not my past self because I deem that I was a fool then , but because I see now that all that my wisdom could do , would have come about without my wisdom ; and that thou , deeming thyself something less than wise , didst accomplish the thing I craved , and that which thou didst crave also ; and withal wisdom embraced thee , along with love . '
120124	120248	120115	120115	she	3905	' O friend , I mock myself of this : that erst thou deemedst me a God and fearedst me , but now thou seemest to me to be a God , and I fear thee . Yea , though I have longed so sore to be with thee since the day of Shadowy Vale , and though I have wearied of the slow wearing of the days , and it hath tormented me ; yet now that I am with thee , I bless the torment of my longing ; for it is but my longing that compelleth me to cast away my fear of thee and caress thee , because I have learned how sweet it is to love thee thus . '
120370	120373	120375	120377	Sun - beam	9050	' Look , '
120391	120446	120375	120377	Sun - beam	9050	' deemest thou not that other speech - friends besides us have been abroad to talk together apart on this morning of the eve of battle . It is nought unwonted , that we do , even though we forget the trouble of the people to think of our own joy for a while . '
120462	120509	120459	120459	she	3909	' O friend , this much may I say for myself in all sooth , that indeed I would die for the kindred and its good days , nor falter therein ; but if I am to die , might I but die in thine arms ! '
120529	120656	120519	120519	his	9050	' What ails us to stand in the doom - ring and bear witness against ourselves before the kindred ? Now I will say , that whatsoever the kindred may or can call upon me to do , that will I do , nor grudge the deed : I am sackless before them . But that is true which I spake to thee when we came together up out of Shadowy Vale , to wit , that I am no strifeful man , but a peaceful ; and I look to it to win through this war , and find on the other side either death , or life amongst a happy folk ; and I deem that this is mostly the mind of our people . '
120660	120671	120657	120657	She	3915	' Thou shalt not die , thou shalt not die ! '
120672	120676	120677	120677	he	3916	' Mayhappen not , '
120680	120760	120677	120677	he	3916	' yet yesterday I could not but look into the slaughter to come , and it seemed to me a grim thing , and darkened the day for me ; and I grew acold as a man walking with the dead . But tell me : thou sayest I shall not die ; dost thou say this only because I am become dear to thee , or dost thou speak it out of thy foresight of things to come ? '
120887	120956	120884	120884	she	3915	' Nay , I have striven to see , and can see nought save the picture of hope and fear that I make for myself . So it oft befalleth foreseeing women , that the love of a man cloudeth their vision . Be content , dear friend ; it is for life or death ; but whichso it be , the same for me and thee together ? '
120957	120960	120961	120961	he	3922	' Yea , '
120964	121003	120961	120961	he	3922	' and well content I am ; so now let each of us trust in the other to be both good and dear , even as I trusted in thee the first hour that I looked on thee . '
121004	121009	121010	121010	she	3915	' It is well , '
121013	121050	121010	121010	she	3915	' it is well . How fair thou art ; and how fair is the morn , and this our Dale in the goodly season ; and all this abideth us when the battle is over . '
121083	121105	121070	121070	she	3915	' See thou ! Here indeed have other lovers passed by across the brook . Shall we wish them good luck ? '
121118	121283	121106	121106	He	3922	' Thou art in haste to make a story up . Indeed I see that these first footprints are of a woman , for no carle of the Dale has a foot as small ; for we be tall fellows ; and these others withal are a man 's footprints ; and if they showed that they had been walking side by side , simple had been thy tale ; but so it is not . I can not say that these two pairs of feet went over the brook within five minutes of each other ; but sure it is that they could not have been faring side by side . Well , belike they were lovers bickering , and we may wish them luck out of that . Truly it is well seen that Bow - may hath done thine hunting for thee , dear friend ; or else wouldest thou have lacked venison ; for thou hast no hunter 's eye . '
121284	121287	121288	121288	she	3924	' Well , '
121291	121305	121288	121288	she	3924	' but wish them luck , and give me thine hand upon it . '
121318	121384	121306	121306	He	3925	' By this hand of my speech - friend , I wish these twain all luck , in love and in leisure , in faring and fighting , in sowing and samming , in getting and giving . Is it well enough wished ? If so it be , then come thy ways , dear friend ; for the day 's work is at hand . '
121385	121391	121392	121392	she	3924	' It is well wished , '
121395	121430	121392	121392	she	3924	' Now hearken : by the valiant hand of the War - leader , by the hand that shall unloose my girdle , I wish these twain to be as happy as we be . '
121533	121555	121529	121530	a man	790	' I saw the tall Guest come abroad from the House and go toward the Bridge very early in the morning . '
121577	121593	121529	121530	a man	790	' Gold - mane , deemest thou that it was my brother whom we blessed ? '
121594	121599	121600	121600	he	3936	' I wot not , '
121603	121620	121600	121600	he	3936	' but I would he were here , for this gear must speedily be looked to . '
121672	121733	121657	121657	He	3936	' Thou hast been seeking me , War - leader ; but grudge it not that I have caused thee to tarry . For as things have gone , I am twice the man for thine helping that I was yester - eve ; and thou art so ready and deft , that all will be done in due time . '
121765	121799	121757	121761	Face - of - god	264	' I am glad of thy gladness ; but now let us dally no longer , for I have many folk to see to - day and much to set a - going . '
122468	122472	122474	122474	he	7596	' At least , '
122478	122503	122474	122474	he	7596	' if I come not to speech with her , I shall be nigh unto her , and shall see somewhat of her beauty . '
123315	123332	123310	123310	he	206	' Where shall I see her again privily if I pass by this time and place ? '
123450	123465	123442	123442	he	206	' Hail to the Daughter of a mighty House ! Mayst thou live happy ! '
123469	123494	123466	123466	She	1030	' Hail to thee also , Guest of our Folk ! Hast thou been wandering about our meadows , and happened on me perchance ? '
123495	123498	123499	123499	he	206	' Nay , '
123502	123521	123499	123499	he	206	' I saw thee come forth from the House of the Steer , and I followed thee hither . '
123535	123545	123529	123529	her	1030	' Thou wilt have something to say to me ? '
123546	123555	123556	123556	he	206	' I have much to say to thee , '
123559	123579	123556	123556	he	206	' yet it was sweet to me to behold thee , even if I might not speak with thee . '
123603	123667	123600	123600	she	1030	' Speak what thou hast in thine heart , and I will hearken without anger whatsoever it may be ; even if thou hast but to tell me of the passing folly of a mighty man , which in a month or two he will not remember for sorrow or for joy . Sit here beside me , and tell me thy thought . '
123676	123773	123669	123669	he	206	' Yea , I have much to say to thee , but it is hard to me to say it . But this I will say : to - day and yesterday make the third time I have seen thee . The first time thou wert happy and calm , and no shadow of trouble was on thee ; the second time thine happy days were waning , though thou scarce knewest it ; but to - day and yesterday thou art constrained by the bonds of grief , and wouldest loosen them if thou mightest . '
123777	123799	123774	123774	She	4006	' What meanest thou ? How knowest thou this ? How may a stranger partake in my joy and my sorrow ? '
123803	123989	123800	123800	He	206	' As for yesterday , all the people might see thy grief and know it . But when I beheld thee the first time , I saw thee that thou wert more fair and lovely than all other women ; and when I was away from thee , the thought of thee and thine image were with me , and I might not put them away ; and oft at such and such a time I wondered and said to myself , what is she doing now ? though god wot I was dealing with tangles and troubles and rough deeds enough . But the second time I beheld thee , when I had looked to have great joy in the sight of thee , my heart was smitten with a pang of grief ; for I saw thee hanging on the words and the looks of another man , who was light - minded toward thee , and that thou wert troubled with the anguish of doubt and fear .

I saw thee yesterday in the street , and thou wert as the ghost of thine old gladness ; although belike thou hast striven with sorrow ; for I see thee with a sword by thy side , and we have been told that thou , O fairest of women , hast given thyself to the Warrior to be his damsel .

124135	124138	124139	124139	she	4010	' Yea , '

124152	124214	124148	124148	He	4011	' But the face which thou bearedst yesterday against thy will , amidst all the people , that was because thou hadst seen my sister the Sun - beam for the first time , and Face - of - god with her , hand clinging to hand , lip longing for lip , desire unsatisfied , but glad with all hope . '
124239	124248	124236	124236	she	4010	' Doth it avail to talk of this ? '
124252	124290	124249	124249	He	4011	' I know not : it may avail ; for I am grieved , and shall be whilst thou art grieved ; and it is my wo nt to strive with my griefs till I amend them . '
124301	124428	124291	124291	She	4010	' O mighty man , canst thou clear away the tangle which besetteth the soul of her whose hope hath bewrayed her ? Canst thou make hope grow up in her heart ? Friend , I will tell thee that when I we d , I shall we d for the sake of the kindred , hoping for no joy therein . Yea , or if by some chance the desire of man came again into my heart , I should strive with it to rid myself of it , for I should know of it that it was but a wasting folly , that should but beguile me , and wound me , and depart , leaving me empty of joy and heedless of life . '
124436	124482	124431	124431	his	4012	' Even so thou deemest now ; but one day it shall be otherwise . Or dost thou love thy sorrow ? I tell thee , as it wears thee and wears thee , thou shalt hate it , and strive to shake it off . '
124483	124488	124489	124489	she	4013	' Nay , nay , '
124492	124515	124489	124489	she	4013	' I love it not ; for not only it grieveth me , but also it beateth me down and belittleth me . '

124525	124637	124523	124523	he	4012	' I know how strong thine heart is . Now , wilt thou take mine hand , which is verily the hand of thy friend , and remember what I have told thee of my grief which can not be sundered from thine ? Shall we not talk more concerning this ? For surely I shall soon see thee again , and often ; since the Warrior , who loveth me belike , leadeth thee into fellowship with me . Yea , I tell thee , O friend , that in that fellowship shalt thou find both the seed of hope , and the sun of desire that shall quicken it . '
124675	124778	124662	124662	she	4014	' This much will I tell thee , O friend ; that what I have said to thee this hour , I thought not to have said to any man ; or to talk with a man of the grief that weareth me , or to suffer him to see my tears ; and marvellous I deem it of thee , for all thy might , that thou hast drawn this speech from out of me , and left me neither angry nor ashamed , in spite of these tears ; and thou whom I have known not , though thou knewest me !
124779	124885	124662	124662	she	4014	' But now it were best that thou depart , and get thee home to the House of the Face , where I was once so frequent ; for I wot that thou hast much to do ; and as thou sayest , it will be in warfare that I shall see thee . Now I thank thee for thy words and the thought thou hast had of me , and the pain which thou hast taken to heal my hurt : I thank thee , I thank thee , for as grievous as it is to show one 's hurts even to a friend . '
124889	124924	124886	124886	He	4015	' O Bride , I thank thee for hearkening to my tale ; and one day shall I thank thee much more . Mayest thou fare well in the Field and amidst the Folk ! '

128304	128627	128629	128629	he	4204	' Bristler , son of Brightling , and ye other good men and true , it is but sooth that the ransackers and the slayer may soon be known ; and here I declare them unto you : I it was and none other who slew Rusty ; and I was the leader of those who ransacked Penny - thumb , and cowed Harts - bane of Greentofts . As for the slaying of Rusty , I slew him because he chased me , and would not forbear , so that I must either slay or be slain , as hath befallen me erewhile , and will befall again , methinks . As for the ransacking of Penny - thumb , I needed the goods that I took , and he needed them not , since he neither used them , nor gave them away , and , they being gone , he hath lived no worser than aforetime . Now I say , that if ye will take the outlawry off me , which , as I hear , ye laid upon me , not knowing me , then will I handsel self - doom to thee , Bristler , if thou wilt bear thy grief to purse , and I will pay thee what thou wilt out of hand ; or if perchance thou wilt call me to Holm , thither will I go , if thou and I come unslain out of this war . As to the ransacking and cowing of Harts - bane , I say that I am sackless therein , because the man is but a ruffler and a man of violence , and hath cowed many men of the Dale ; and if he gainsay me , then do I call him to the Holm after this war is over ; either him or any man who will take his place before my sword . '
128716	128793	128710	128710	Bristler	237	' Tall man , we know that thou art a chieftain and of good will to the men of the Dale and their friends , and that want drave thee to the ransacking , and need to the manslaying , and neither the living nor the dead to whom thou art guilty are to be called good men ; therefore will I bring the matter to purse , if thou wilt handsel me self - doom . '
128794	128803	128805	128807	Folk - might	7596	' Yea , even so let it be , '

As for the ransacking of Penny - thumb , he shall deem himself well paid if thou give him our hundreds in weed - stuff for that which thou didst borrow of him . '
129085	129115	129080	129082	Folk - might	304	' Draw nigh now , Penny - thumb , and take what thou wilt of this gear , which I need not , and grudge not at me henceforward . '

129287	129329	129281	129282	the Alderman	590	' Now , since the fines have been paid duly and freely , according to the dooming of Bristler , take we off the outlawry from Folk - might and his fellows , and account them to be sackless before us . '
129427	129638	129421	129422	the Alderman	590	' Men of the Dale , and ye Shepherds and Woodlanders ; it is well known to you that we have foemen in the wood and beyond it ; and now have we gotten sure tidings , that they will not abide at home or in the wood , but are minded to fall upon us at home . Now therefore I will not ask you whether ye will have peace or war ; for with these foemen ye may have peace no otherwise save by war . But if ye think with me , three things have ye to determine : first , whether ye will abide your foes in your own houses , or will go meet them at theirs ; next , whether ye will take to you as fellows in arms a valiant folk of the children of the Gods , who are foemen to our foemen ; and lastly , what man ye will have to be your War - leader . Now , I bid all those here assembled , to speak hereof , any man of them that will , either what they may have conceived in their own minds , or what their kindred may have put into their mouths to speak . '
129671	129744	129665	129666	the Alderman	590	' O Alderman , all we say : Since war is awake we will not tarry , but will go meet our foes while it is yet time . The valiant men of whom thou tellest shall be our fellows , were there but three of them . We know no better War - leader than Face - of - god of the House of the Face . Let him lead us . '
129762	129795	129806	129808	Fox of Upton	279	' The House of the Bridge would have Face - of - god for War - leader , these tall men for fellows , and the shortest way to meet the foe . '
129813	129859	129806	129808	Fox of Upton	279	' Time presses , or much might be spoken . Thus saith the House of the Bull : Let us go meet the foe , and take these valiant strangers for way - leaders , and Face - of - god for War - leader . '
129893	130014	129882	129884	the old man	784	' The Men of the Vine bid me say their will : They will not stay at home to have their houses burned over their heads , themselves slain on their own hearths , and their wives haled off to thralldom . They will take any man for their fellow in arms who will smite stark strokes on their side . They know Face - of - god , and were liefer of him for War - leader than any other , and they will follow him wheresoever he leadeth . Thus my kindred biddeth me say , and I hight Fork - beard of Lea . If I live through this war , I shall have lived through five . '
130034	130069	130029	130029	his	677	' To all this I say yea , and so am I bidden by the kindred of the Sickle . I am Red - beard of the Knolls , the son of my father . '
130088	130143	130081	130083	Stone - face	206	' The House of the Face saith : Lead us through the wood , O Face - of - god , thou War - leader , and ye warriors of the Wolf . I am Stone - face , as men know , and this word hath been given to me by the kindred . '
130186	130268	130177	130177	Strongitharm	308	' The Men of Greenbury , and they of the Fleece and the Thorn , are of one accord , and bid us say that they are well pleased to have Face- of - god for War - leader ; and that they will follow him and the warriors of the Wolf to live or die with them ; and that they are ready to go meet the foe at once , and will not skulk behind the walls of Greenbury . '
130358	130398	130344	130344	he	4250	' O war , war ! O death ! O wounding and grief ! O loss of friends and kindred ! let all this be rather than the drawing back of meeting hands and the sundering of yearning hearts ! '
130425	130480	130417	130419	a young man	6707	' As is the word of Red - wolf , so is my word , Bears - bane of Carlstead ; and this is the word which our little Folk hath put into our mouths ; and O ! that our hands may show the meaning of our mouths ; for nought else can . '
130595	130653	130588	130589	the Alderman	590	' Now have ye yeasaid three things : That we take Face - of - god of the House of the Face for our War - leader ; that we fare under weapons at once against them who would murder us ; and that we take the valiant Folk of the Wolf for our fellows in arms . '
130689	130727	130686	130686	he	590	' Now , if any man will speak , here is the War - leader , and here is the chief of our new friends , to answer to whatso any of the kindred would have answered . '
130752	130890	130731	130732	the Fiddle	291	' Alderman , we would ask of the War - leader if he hath devised the manner of our assembling , and the way of our war - faring , and the day of our hosting . More than this I will not ask of him , because we wot that in so great an assembly it may be that the foe may have some spy of whom we wot not ; and though this be not likely , yet some folk may babble ; therefore it is best for the wise to be wise everywhere and always . Therefore my rede it is , that no man ask any more concerning this , but let it lie with the War - leader to bring us face to face with the foe as speedily as he may . '
130910	130996	130900	130905	But Face - of - god	2955	' Ye Men of the Dale , ye Shepherds and Woodlanders , meseemeth the Fiddle hath spoken wisely . Now therefore I answer him and say , that I have so ordered everything since the Gate - thing was holden at Burgstead , that we may come face to face with the foemen by the shortest of roads . Every man shall be duly summoned to the Hosting , and if any man fail , let it be accounted a shame to him for ever . '
131020	131147	131012	131014	Fox of Upton	279	' O Alderman , we have yeasaid the fellowship of the valiant men who have come to us from out of the waste ; but this we have done , not because we have known them , otherwise than by what our kinsman Face- of - god hath told us concerning them , but because we have seen clearly that they will be of much avail to us in our warfare . Now , therefore , if the tall chieftain who sitteth beside thee were to do us to wit what he is , and whence he and his are come , it were well , and fain were we thereof ; but if he listeth not to tell us , that also shall be well . '
131226	131287	131219	131219	Folk	206	' O Men of the Dale and the Sheepcotes , I will do as ye bid me do ; And fain were ye of the story if every deal ye knew . But long , long were its telling , were I to tell it all : Let it bide till the Cup of Deliverance ye drink from hall to hall .
131288	131327	131219	131219	Folk	206	' Like you we be of the kindreds , of the Sons of the Gods we come , Midst the Mid - earth 's mighty Woodland of old we had our home ; But of older time we abided '
131511	131564	131813	131813	He	4281	' So saith the ancient story , that west and west we went , And many a day of battle we had in brake , on bent ; Whilst here a while we tarried , and there we hastened on , And still the battle - harvest from many a folk we won .
131565	131812	131813	131813	He	4281	' Of the tale of the days who wotteth ? Of the years what man can tell , While the Sons of the Wolf were wandering , and knew not where to dwell ? But at last we clomb the mountains , and mickle was our toil , As high the spear - wood clambered of the drivers of the spoil ; And tangled were the passes and the beacons flared behind , And the horns of gathering onset came up upon the wind . So saith the ancient story , that we stood in a mountain - cleft , Where the ways and the valleys sundered to the right hand and the left . There in the place of sundering all woeful was the rede ; We knew no land before us , and behind was heavy need . As the sword cleaves through the byrny , so there the mountain flank Cleft through the God - kin 's people ; and ne'er again we drank The wine of war together , or feasted side by side In the Feast - hall of the Warrior on the fruit of the battle - tide . For there we turned and sundered ; unto the North we went And up along the waters , and the clattering stony bent ; And unto the South and the Sheepcotes down went our sister 's sons ; And O for the years passed over since we saw those valiant ones ! '

But as for that tale of the Ancients , it saith that we who went To the northward , climbed and stumbled o'er many a stony bent , Till we happed on that isle of the waste - land , and the grass of Shadowy Vale , Where we dwelt till we throve a little , and felt our might avail . Then we fared abroad from the shadow and the little - lighted hold , And the increase fell to the valiant , and the spoil to the battle- bold , And never a man gainsaid us with the weapons in our hands ; And in Silver - dale the happy we gat us life and lands .
132411	132556	132647	132648	the Alderman	205	' So wore the years o'er - wealthy ; and meseemeth that ye know How we sowed and reaped destruction , and the Day of the overthrow : How we leaned on the staff we had broken , and put our lives in the hand Of those whom we had vanquished and the feeble of the land ; And these were the stone of stumbling , and the burden not to be borne , When the battle - blast fell on us and our day was over - worn . Thus then did our wealth bewray us , and left us wise and sad ; And to you , bold men , it falleth once more to make us glad , If so your hearts are bidding , and ye deem the deed of worth .

132652	132755	132647	132648	the Alderman	205	' Friend , and chieftain of the Wolf , thou mayst hear by this shouting of the people that we have no mind to naysay our yea - say . And know that it is not our use and manner to seek the strong for friends , and to thrust aside the weak ; but rather to choose for our friends them who are of like mind to us , men in whom we put our trust . From henceforth then there is brotherhood between us ; we are yours , and ye are ours ; and let this endure for ever ! '
133995	134087	133989	133991	Folk - might	7596	' A full and free greeting to our brothers ! Well be ye , O Sons of our Ancient Fathers ! And to - day are ye the dearer to us because we see that ye have brought us a gift , to wit , your wives and children , and your grandsires unmeet for war .

136135	136270	136129	136129	he	4483	' My friend , I have been thinking of thee and of me ; and now hearken : if thou wilt declare that thou feelest no sweetness embracing thine heart when I say that I desire thee sorely , as now I say it ; or when I kiss thine hand , as now I kiss it ; or when I pray thee to suffer me to cast mine arms about thee and kiss thy face , as now I pray it : if thou wilt say this , then will I take thee by the hand straightway , and lead thee to the tents of the House of the Steer , and say farewell to thee till the battle is over . Canst thou say this out of the truth of thine heart ? '
136274	136288	136271	136271	She	4484	' What then if I can not say this word ? What then ? '

136365	136402	136362	136362	she	4484	' Yet after all this shalt thou lead me back to my folk straight - way ; and when the battle is done , if both we are living , then shall we speak more thereof . '
136443	136478	136440	136440	he	4485	' Now is this better for me than if it had not been , whether I live or whether I die . Yet thou hast not said that thou lovest me and desirest me . '

136489	136528	136486	136486	she	4484	' To - night I may not say it . Who shall say what words my lips shall fashion when we stand together victorious in Silver - dale ; then indeed may the time seem long from now . '
136532	136606	136529	136529	He	4485	' Yea , true is that ; yet once again I say that so measured long and long is the time since first I saw thee in Burgdale before thou knewest me . Yet now I will not bicker with thee , for be sure that I am glad at heart . And lo you ! our feet have brought us to the tents of thy people . All good go with thee ! '

He spake with one or two of these , and then went up to the head of the Vale , where was the pass that led to Silver - dale ; and there he saw the watch , and spake with them , and they told him that none had as yet come forth from the pass , and he bade them to blow the horn of warning to rouse up the Host as soon as the messengers came thence . For forerunners had been sent up the pass , and had been set to hold watch at divers places therein to pass on the word from place to place .

For how could I bear the sight of the fair Dale , and no hope to see thee again therein ? '
137075	137183	137072	137072	She	4494	' The heart is light within me to - day . Deemest thou that this is strange ? Or dost thou call to mind that which thou spakest the other day , that it was of no avail to stand in the Doom - ring of the Folk and bear witness against ourselves ? This will I not . This is no light - mindedness that thou beholdest in me , but the valiancy that the Fathers have set in mine heart . Deem not , O Gold - mane , fear not , that we shall die before they dight the bride - bed for us . '
137214	137261	137192	137192	she	4494	' This is not the last time that thou shalt kiss me , Gold - mane , my dear ; and yet I long for it as if it were , so high as the Fathers have raised me up this morn above fear and sadness . '
137434	137477	137431	137431	she	4494	' Thus then we depart from this Valley of the Shadows , but as thou saidst when first we met therein , there shall be no sundering of thee and me , but thou shalt go down with me to the battle . '

149625	150002	149612	149617	those big spearmen of the Dale	5138	' voice died out , and their great - staved spears rose up from their shoulders into the air , and stood so a moment , and then slowly fell forward , as the oars of the longship fall into the row - locks , and then over the shoulders of the foremost men showed the steel of the five ranks behind them , and their own spears cast long bars of shadow on the whiteness of the sunny road . No sound came from them now save the rattle of their armour and the tramp of their steady feet ; but from the Dusky Men rose up hideous confused yelling , and those that could free themselves from the tangle of the throng rushed desperately against the on - rolling hedge of steel , and the whole throng shoved on behind them . Then met steel and men ; here and there an ash - stave broke ; here and there a Dusky Felon rolled himself unhurt under the ash - staves , and hewed the knees of the Dalesmen , and a tall man came tottering down ; but what men or wood - wights could endure the push of spears of those mighty husbandmen ? The Dusky Ones shrunk back yelling , or turned their backs and rushed at their own folk with such fierce agony that they entered into the throng , till the terror of the spear reached to the midmost of it and swayed them back on the hindermost ; for neither was there outgate for the felons on the flanks of the spearmen , since there the feathered death beset them , and the bowmen and the Bride amongst the foremost shot wholly together , and no shaft flew idly . But the wise leaders of the Dalesmen would not that they should thrust in too far amongst the howling throng of the Dusky Men , lest they should be hemmed in by them ; for they were but a handful in regard to them : so there they stayed , barring the way to the Dusky Men , and the bowmen still loosed from the flanks of them , or aimed deftly from betwixt the ranks of the spearmen .

But the slain whom they find of the kindreds do they array out yonder before this Hall . In all wise are these men tame and biddable , save that they rage against the Dusky Men , though they fear them yet . As for us , they deem us Gods come down from heaven to help them . So much for what is good : now have I an ill word to say ; to wit , that in the houses whereas we have found many thralls alive , yet also have we found many dead ; for amongst these murder - carles were some of an evil sort , who , when they saw that the battle would go against them , rushed into the houses hewing down all before them - man , woman , and child ; so that many of the halls and chambers we saw running blood like to shambles . To be short : of them whom they were going to hew to the Gods , we have found thirteen living and three dead , of which latter is one woman ; and of the living , seven women ; and all these , living and dead , with the leaden shackles yet on them wherein they should be burned . To all these and others whom we have found , we have done what of service we could in the way of victual and clothes , so that they scarce believe that they are on this lower earth . Moreover , I have with me two score of them , who are men of some wits , and who know of the stores of victual and other wares which the felons had , and these will fetch and carry for you as much as ye will .

But your folk they fear as warriors of the world , who have slain the Dusky Men in the Market- place of Silver - stead ; and they are of alien blood to them , men who will do as their friend biddeth think our folk against them who are neither friends or foes .

Great was the joy of these messengers as they went from company to company of the warriors , and saw the familiar faces of their friends , and heard their wonted voices telling all the story of battle and slaughter . And for their part the men of the Host feasted these stay - at - homes , and made much of them . But one of them , a man of the House of the Face , left the Host a little after nightfall , and bore back to Burgstead at once the tidings of the coming home of the Host . Albeit since Dallach 's tidings of victory had come to the Dale , the dwellers in the steads of the country - side had left Burgstead and gone home to their own houses ; so that there was no great multitude abiding in the Thorp .

For he had gone with the other grooms to that gathered band , and had passed from one to the other , not finding her , till he had got him through the whole company , and beheld her awaiting him . Then indeed he bounded toward her , and caught her by the hands , and then by the shoulders , and drew her to him , and she nothing loth ; and in that while he said to her :

When we are in the meadows we shall sit down for a minute on a bank under the chestnut trees , and thence watch the moon coming up over the southern cliffs . And I shall behold thee in the summer night , and deem that I see all thy beauty ; which yet shall make me dumb with wonder when I see it indeed in the house amongst the candles . '
181975	181979	181980	181980	she	6455	' O nay , '
181983	182003	181980	181980	she	6455	' by the Portway shall we go ; the torch - bearers shall be abiding thee at the gate . '
182011	182067	181866	181866	He	6454	' Then shall we rise up and wend first through a wide treeless meadow , wherein amidst the night we shall behold the kine moving about like odorous shadows ; and through the greyness of the moonlight thou shalt deem that thou seest the pink colour of the eglantine blossoms , so fragrant they are .

182068	182072	182073	182073	she	6455	' O nay , '

There in the ancient walnut - tree the owl sitteth breathing hard in the night - time ; but thou shalt not hear him for the joy of the nightingales singing from the apple - trees of the close . Then from out of the shadowed orchard shall we come into the open town - meadow , and over its daisies shall the moonlight be lying in a grey flood of brightness .
182190	182357	181866	181866	He	6454	' Short is the way across it to the brim of the Weltering Water , and across the water lieth the fair garden of the Face ; and I have dight for thee there a little boat to waft us across the night - dark waters , that shall be like wavering flames of white fire where the moon smites them , and like the void of all things where the shadows hang over them . There then shall we be in the garden , beholding how the hall - windows are yellow , and hearkening the sound of the hall - glee borne across the flowers and blending with the voice of the nightingales in the trees . There then shall we go along the grass paths whereby the pinks and the cloves and the lavender are sending forth their fragrance , to cheer us , who faint at the scent of the over - worn roses , and the honey - sweetness of the lilies .
182358	182418	182090	182090	he	6456	' All this is for thee , and for nought but for thee this even ; and many a blossom whereof thou knowest nought shall grieve if thy foot tread not thereby to - night ; if the path of thy wedding which I have made , be void of thee , on the even of the Chamber of Love .
182419	182576	181866	181866	He	6454	' But lo ! at last at the garden 's end is the yew - walk arched over for thee , and thou canst not see whereby to enter it ; but I , I know it , and I lead thee into and along the dark tunnel through the moonlight , and thine hand is not weary of mine as we go . But at the end shall we come to a wicket , which shall bring us out by the gable - end of the Hall of the Face . Turn we about its corner then , and there are we blinking on the torches of the torch - bearers , and the candles through the open door , and the hall ablaze with light and full of joyous clamour , like the bale - fire in the dark night kindled on a ness above the sea by fisher - folk remembering the Gods . '
182577	182581	182582	182582	she	6457	' O nay , '
182585	182603	182582	182582	she	6457	' but by the Portway must we go ; the straightest way to the Gate of Burgstead . '
182811	182842	182804	182808	And old Stone - face	6477	' Too many are the rows of bee - skeps in the gardens of the Dale that we should begrudge wayward lovers an hour 's waste of candle - light . '
182921	182947	182909	182909	he	6475	' How then have I kept mine oath , whereas I swore on the Holy Boar to we d the fairest woman of the world ? '
183009	183034	182986	182987	the God	773	' How fares it now with my darling and my daughter , who dwelleth amongst strangers in the land beyond the wild - wood ? '
183494	183551	183488	183490	Folk - might	206	' Fair greeting and love to my friend and the daughter of my Folk ! How farest thou , Bow - may , best of all friendly women ? How fareth my sister , and Face - of - god my brother ? and how is it with our friends and helpers in the goodly Dale ? '
183557	183620	183553	183555	Bow - may	347	' It is well both with all those and with me ; and my heart laughs to see thee , Folk - might , and to look on the elders of the valiant , and our lovely sister the Bride . But I have a message for thee from Face - of - god : wilt thou that I deliver it here ? '
183621	183625	183627	183629	Folk - might	7596	' Yea surely , '
183725	183812	183698	183700	Bow - may	347	' Thus saith Face - of - god : " Friend and kinswoman , well - beloved playmate , the gift which thou badest of me in sorrow do thou now take in joy , and do all the good thou wouldest to the son of thy friend . The ring which I gave thee once in the garden of the Face , give thou to Bow - may , my trusty and well - beloved , in token of the fulfilment of my behest . " '
183844	184001	183840	183840	she	755	' To thee also , Folk - might , I have a message from Face - of - god , who saith : " Mighty warrior , friend and fellow , all things thrive with us , and we are happy . Yet is there a hollow place in our hearts which grieveth us , and only thou and thine may amend it . Though whiles we hear tell of thee , yet we see thee not , and fain were we , might we see thee , and wot if the said tales be true . Wilt thou help us somewhat herein , or wilt thou leave us all the labour ? For sure we be that thou wilt not say that thou rememberest us no more , and that thy love for us is departed . " This is his message , Folk - might , and he would have an answer from thee . '
184010	184023	184004	184006	Folk - might	7596	' Sister Bow - may , seest thou these weaponed men hereby ? '
184024	184027	184028	184028	she	7596	' Yea , '
184034	184080	184032	184032	he	7596	' These men bear a message with them to Face - of - god my brother . Crow the Shaft - speeder , stand forth and tell thy friend Bow - may the message I have set in thy mouth , every word of it . '
184095	184136	184082	184082	Crow	280	' Friend Bow - may , this is the message of our Alderman : " Friend and helper , in the Dale which thou hast given to us do all things thrive ; neither are we grown old in three years '

184407	184419	184403	184405	Folk - might	7596	' What say'st thou to the message , Bow - may ? '
184420	184428	184430	184430	she	7596	' It is good in all ways , '
184432	184457	184430	184430	she	7596	' but is it timely ? May our folk have the message and get to Shadowy Vale , so as to meet you there ? '
184458	184462	184464	184466	Folk - might	7596	' Yea surely , '
184468	184485	184464	184466	Folk - might	7596	' for our kinsmen here shall take the road through Shadowy Vale , and in four days '
184504	184511	184513	184513	he	7596	' journey thence to Shadowy Vale . '
184523	184538	184513	184513	he	7596	' Kinsman Crow , depart now , and use all diligence with thy message . '
184553	184618	184547	184549	Bow - may	347	' Ho ! Folk- might , my friend , I perceive thou art little changed from the man I knew in Shadowy Vale , who would have his dinner before the fowl were plucked . For shall I not go back with these thy messengers , so that I also may get all ready to wend to the Mote - house of Shadowy Vale ? '
184632	184709	184620	184621	the Bride	755	' Sister Bow - may , his meaning is that thou shouldest abide here in Silver - dale till we depart for the Folk - thing , and then go thither with us ; and this I also pray thee to do , that thou mayst rejoice the hearts of thine old friends ; and also that thou mayst teach me all that I should know concerning this fair child of my brother and my sister . '
184735	184793	184731	184731	she	6538	' Would that I might never depart from the house wherein thou dwellest , O Bride of my Kinsman ! And this that thou biddest me is easy and pleasant for me to do . But afterwards I must get me back to Burgdale ; for I seem to have left much there that calleth for me . '
184794	184797	184799	184801	Folk - might	7596	' Yea , '
184803	184823	184799	184801	Folk - might	7596	' and art thou wedded , Bow - may ? Shalt thou never bend the yew in battle again ? '
184830	184865	184825	184827	Bow - may	224	' Who knoweth , chieftain ? Yea , I am wedded now these two years ; and nought I looked for less when I followed those twain through the wild - wood to Burgdale . '
184873	184913	184866	184866	She	6541	' In all the Dale there is no better man of his hands than my man , nor any goodlier to look on , and he is even that Hart of Highcliff whom thou knowest well , O Bride ! '
184918	184932	184915	184916	the Bride	755	' Thou sayest sooth , there is no better man in the Dale . '
184938	184954	184934	184936	Bow - may	224	' Sun - beam bade me we d him when he pressed hard upon me . '
184963	184993	184955	184955	She	224	' Face - of - god also deemed I should not naysay the man ; and now my son by him is of like age to this little one . '
184994	185000	185002	185004	Folk - might	7596	' Good is thy story , '
185006	185070	185002	185004	Folk - might	7596	' or deemest thou , Bow - may , that such strong and goodly women as thou , and women so kind and friendly , should forbear the wedding and the bringing forth of children ? Yea , and we who may even yet have to gather to another field before we die , and fight for life and the goods of life . '
185071	185076	185077	185077	she	224	' Thou sayest well , '
185080	185104	185077	185077	she	224	' all that hath befallen me is good since the day whereon I loosed shaft from the break of the bent over yonder . '
