Her mother , not unkindly , sadly , had counted her poor girl 's chances of winning attention and a husband . Her father had doated on her face ; but , as she argued , her father had been attracted by her mother , a beautiful woman , and this was a circumstance that reflected the greater hopelessness on her prospects . She bore a likeness to her father , little to her mother , though he fancied the reverse and gave her the mother 's lips and hair . Thinking of herself , however , was destructive to the form of her mirror of knightliness : he wavered , he fled for good , as the rosy vapour born of our sensibility must do when we relapse to coldness , and the more completely when we try to command it . No , she thought , a plain girl should think of work , to earn her independence .

19736	19752	19734	19734	Chillon	267	' for where it 's with the offensive , there 's everlasting bullying and plundering . '

19860	19873	19780	19780	Tenderness	284	' There 's a nobleman anxious to bestow his titles on her . '
19874	19879	19780	19780	Tenderness	284	' He is rich ? '
19880	19893	19780	19780	Tenderness	284	' The first or second wealthiest in Great Britain , they say . '

21182	21231	21179	21179	her	215	' But I had the same wish . They told us at the inn of an Englishman who left last night to sleep on the mountain , and would go alone ; and did I not say , brother , that must be true love of the mountains ? '
21232	21244	21249	21249	He	600	' These freaks get us a bad name on the Continent , '

21379	21384	21377	21377	Chillon	267	' you can stand ? '
21385	21392	21393	21393	He	600	' Pretty well , I think . '
21469	21501	21460	21460	he	600	' Now you can leave me ; and let me thank you . Half an hour will set me right . My name is Woodseer , if ever we meet again . '
21545	21554	21540	21540	She	215	' I should like to hear more English . '
21555	21572	21529	21530	Her brother	600	' My dear girl , you 'll have enough of it in two or three weeks . '
21573	21585	21540	21540	She	215	' Should we leave a good deed half done , Chillon ? '
21586	21593	21529	21530	Her brother	600	' He shall have our guide . '
21594	21601	21540	21540	She	215	' He may not be rich . '
21602	21612	21529	21530	Her brother	600	' I 'll pay Anton to stick to him . '
21613	21623	21540	21540	She	215	' Brother , he has an objection to guides . '
21632	21638	21639	21639	He	267	' Five minutes , then . '
21656	21705	21641	21642	Mr. Woodseer	289	' Your objection to guides might have taught you a sharp lesson . It 's like declining to have a master in studying a science - trusting to instinct for your knowledge of a bargain . One might as well refuse an oar to row in a boat . '
21706	21713	21714	21716	the young man	1196	' I 'd rather risk it , '
21719	21738	21714	21716	the young man	1196	' These guides kick the soul out of scenery . I came for that and not for them . '
21739	21752	21641	21642	Mr. Woodseer	289	' You might easily have been a disagreeable part of the scene . '
21753	21762	21714	21716	the young man	1196	' Why not here as well as elsewhere ? '
21763	21772	21641	21642	Mr. Woodseer	289	' You do n't care for your life ? '
21773	21788	21714	21716	the young man	1196	' I try not to care for it a fraction more than Destiny does . '
21789	21799	21641	21642	Mr. Woodseer	289	' Fatalism . I suppose you care for something ? '
21800	21937	21942	21942	he	1635	' Besides I 've a slack purse , and shun guides and inns when I can . I care for open air , colour , flowers , weeds , birds , insects , mountains . There 's a world behind the mask . I call this life ; and the town 's a boiling pot , intolerably stuffy . My one ambition is to be out of it . I thank heaven I have not another on earth . Yes , I care for my note - book , because it 's of no use to a human being except me . I slept beside a spring last night , and I never shall like a bedroom so well . I think I have discovered the great secret : I may be wrong , of course . '
22050	22071	22047	22047	He	1635	' Here the brook 's the brook , the mountain 's the mountain : they are as they always were . '
22072	22081	22082	22082	Chillon	267	' You 'd have men be the same , '
22094	22109	22091	22091	he	1635	' They 've lost more than they 've gained ; though , he admitted , '
22121	22121	22091	22091	he	1635	'
22182	22188	22189	22189	Chillon	267	' I would advise you , '
22192	22218	22189	22189	Chillon	267	' to get a pair of Styrian boots , if you intend to stay in the Alps . Those boots of yours are London make . '
22219	22221	22222	22223	my father	1644	' They 're
22227	22231	22222	22223	my father	1644	' said Mr. Woodseer .
22238	22248	22249	22249	He	267	' Come , Carinthia , we must be off . '
22334	22347	22313	22313	her	215	' You have not yet your strength to come on with us ? '
22432	22442	22418	22418	Anton	288	' Have we been quite kind to that gentleman ? '
22449	22486	22443	22443	Chillon	267	' He 's there still ; he 's fond of solitude . And , Carin , my dear , do n't give your hand when you are meeting or parting with people it 's not done . '
22492	22499	22487	22489	His uninstructed sister	1653	' Did you not like him ? '
22505	22508	22500	22500	She	1653	' Oh , '
22520	22588	22500	22500	She	1653	' Some of the ideas he has are Lord Fleetwood 's , I hear , and one can understand them in a man of enormous wealth , who does n't know what to do with himself and is dead - sick of flattery ; though it seems odd for an English nobleman to be raving about Nature . Perhaps it 's because none else of them does . '
22589	22598	22622	22622	Chillon	267	' Lord Fleetwood loves our mountains , Chillon ? '
22599	22620	22622	22622	Chillon	267	' But a fellow who probably has to make his way in the world ! - and he despises ambition ! '
22922	22932	22933	22933	she	1658	' I wonder what that gentleman is doing now , '
22975	22977	22946	22946	he	267	' gentleman '
23003	23017	22985	22985	Her	1658	' It 's the unlikeliest thing possible - at all events in England . '
23018	23025	23027	23027	she	1658	' But I think we shall , '
23029	23047	22985	22985	Her	1658	' My dear , you meet people of your own class ; you do n't meet others . '
23048	23057	23103	23103	he	267	' But we may meet anybody , Chillon ! '
23058	23077	22985	22985	Her	1658	' In the street . I suppose you would not stop to speak to him in the street . '
23078	23090	23091	23091	Carinthia	215	' It would be strange to see him in the street ! '
23094	23099	23103	23103	he	267	' Strange or not ! '
23324	23335	23336	23336	she	215	' You will tell them how I walked with you , '
23339	23345	23347	23347	he	1691	' Your friends over yonder ? '
23349	23362	23363	23363	She	215	' So that they may not think me so ignorant , brother . '
23496	23540	23493	23493	he	1691	' Come , come , you can dance . You dance well , mother has told me , and she was a judge . You ride , you swim , you have a voice for country songs , at all events . And you 're
23549	23593	23493	23493	he	1691	're good at English and German ; you had a French governess for a couple of years . By the way , you understand the use of a walking - stick in self - defence : you could handle a sword on occasion . '

23603	23612	23601	23601	Carthinia	282	' I can fire a pistol , aiming . '
23613	23656	23668	23668	he	1698	' With a good aim , too . Father told me you could . How fond he was of his girl ! Well , bear in mind that father was proud of you , and hold up your head wherever you are . '
23657	23661	23662	23662	she	215	' I will , '
23713	23722	23723	23723	she	215	' Which is the hard one to please ? '
23726	23738	23696	23696	She	215	' The one you will find the kinder of the two . '
23739	23742	23696	23696	She	215	' Henrietta ? '
23746	23752	23696	23696	She	215	' Has she a father ? '
23753	23763	23696	23696	She	215	' A gallant old admiral : Admiral Baldwin Fakenham . '
23764	23771	23696	23696	She	215	' I am glad of that ! '
23777	23790	23696	23696	She	215	' And he is with her ? And likes you , Chillon ? '
23791	23801	23696	23696	She	215	' On the whole , I think he does . '
23802	23807	23696	23696	She	215	' A brave officer ! '
23865	23874	23876	23876	Carinthia	215	' We are not tired in the slightest , '
23888	23899	23876	23876	Carinthia	215	' I could go on through the night quite comfortably . '
23900	23914	23915	23915	Chillon	267	' Wait till you wake up in your little bed to - morrow , '
23947	23948	23945	23946	THE LADY	805	'S LETTER
24131	24139	24128	24128	Chillon	267	' Well , we must wash and eat '
24232	24267	24268	24268	she	215	' We can have a carriage here , Chillon ; order a carriage ; I shall get as much sleep in a carriage as in a bed : I shall enjoy driving at night , '
24334	24339	24305	24305	she	215	' Most picturesque of Castles !
24352	24352	24296	24296	her	215	'
24353	24542	24296	24296	her	215	' We start at noon to - day . Sailing orders have been issued , and I could only have resisted them in my own person by casting myself overboard . I go like the boat behind the vessel . You were expected yesterday , at latest this morning . I have seen boxes in the hall , with a name on them not foreign to me . Why does the master tarry ? Sir , of your valliance you should have held to your good vow , - quoth the damozel , for now you see me sore perplexed and that you did not your devoir is my affliction . Where lingers chivalry , she should have proceeded , if not with my knight ? I feast on your regrets . I would not have you less than miserable : and I fear the reason is , that I am not so very , very sure you will be so at all or very hugely , as I would command it of you for just time enough to see that change over your eyebrows I know so well .
24543	24626	24296	24296	her	215	' If you had seen a certain Henrietta yesterday you would have the picture of how you ought to look . The admiral was heard welcoming a new arrival - you can hear him . She ran down the stairs quicker than any cascade of this district , she would have made a bet with Livia that it could be no one else - her hand was out , before she was aware of the difference it was locked in Lord F. 's !
24627	24699	24296	24296	her	215	' Let the guilty absent suffer for causing such a betrayal of disappointment . I must be avenged ! But if indeed you are unhappy and would like to chide the innocent , I am full of compassion for the poor gentleman inheriting my legitimate feelings of wrath , and beg merely that he will not pour them out on me with pen and paper , but from his lips and eyes .
24700	24819	24296	24296	her	215	' Time pressing , I chatter no more . The destination is Livia 's beloved Baden . We rest a night in the city of Mozart , a night at Munich , a night at Stuttgart . Baden will detain my cousin full a week . She has Captain Abrane and Sir Meeson Corby in attendance - her long shadow and her short : both devoted to Lord F. , to win her smile , and how he drives them ! The captain has been paraded on the promenade , to the stupefaction of the foreigner . Princes , counts , generals , diplomats passed under him in awe . I am told that he is called St. Christopher .
24820	24848	24296	24296	her	215	' Why do we go thus hastily ? - my friend , this letter has to be concealed . I know some one who sees in the dark .
24849	25071	24296	24296	her	215	' Think no harm of Livia . She is bent upon my worldly advantage , and that is plain even to the person rejecting it . How much more so must it be to papa , though he likes you , and when you are near him would perhaps , in a fit of unworldliness , be almost as reckless as the creature he calls madcap and would rather call countess . No ! sooner with a Will - o'-the - wisp , my friend . Who could ever know where the man was when he himself never knows where he is . He is the wind that bloweth as it listeth - because it is without an aim or always with a new one . And am I the one to direct him ? I need direction . My lord and sovereign must fix my mind . I am volatile , earthly , not to be trusted if I do not worship . He himself said to me that - he reads our characters . " Nothing but a proved hero will satisfy Henrietta , " his words ! And the hero must be shining like a beacon - fire kept in a blaze . Quite true ; I own it . Is Chillon Kirby satisfied ? He ought to be .
25072	25627	24296	24296	her	215	' But oh ! - to be yoked is an insufferable thought , unless we name all the conditions . But to be yoked to a creature of impulses ! Really I could only describe his erratic nature by commending you to the study of a dragon - fly . It would map you an idea of what he has been in the twenty - four hours since we had him here . They tell me a vain sort of person is the cause . Can she be the cause of his resolving to have a residence here , to buy up half the valley - erecting a royal palace - and marking out the site - raving about it in the wildest language , poetical if it had been a little reasonable - and then , after a night , suddenly , unaccountably , hating the place , and being under the necessity of flying from it in hot haste , tearing us all away , as if we were attached to a kite that will neither mount nor fall , but rushes about headlong . Has he heard , or suspected ? or seen certain boxes bearing a name ? Livia has no suspicion , though she thinks me wonderfully contented in so dull a place , where it has rained nine days in a fortnight . I ask myself whether my manner of greeting him betrayed my expectation of another . He has brains . It is the greatest of errors to suppose him at all like the common run of rich young noblemen . He seems to thirst for brilliant wits and original sayings . His ambition is to lead all England in everything ! I readily acknowledge that he has generous ideas too ; but try to hold him , deny him his liberty , and it would be seen how desperate and relentless he would be to get loose . Of this I am convinced : he would be either the most abject of lovers , or a woman if it turned out not to be love would find him the most unscrupulous of yoke - fellows . Yoke - fellow ! She would not have her reason in consenting . A lamb and a furious bull ! Papa and I have had a serious talk . He shuts his ears to my comparisons , but admits , that as I am the principal person concerned , etc . Rich and a nobleman is too tempting for an anxious father ; and Livia 's influence is paramount . She has not said a syllable in depreciation of you . That is to her credit . She also admits that I must yield freely if at all , and she grants me the use of similes ; but her tactics are to contest them one by one , and the admirable pretender is not as shifty as the mariner 's breeze , he is not like the wandering spark in burnt paper , of which you can not say whether it is chasing or chased : it is I who am the shifty Pole to the steadiest of magnets . She is a princess in other things besides her superiority to Physics . There will be wild scenes at Baden .
25628	25675	24296	24296	her	215	' My Diary of to - day is all bestowed on you . What have I to write in it except the pair of commas under the last line of yesterday - " He has not come ! " Oh ! to be caring for a he .
25676	25716	24296	24296	her	215	' O that I were with your sister now , on one side of her idol , to correct her extravagant idolatry ! I long for her . I had a number of nice little phrases to pet her with .
25717	25890	24296	24296	her	215	' You have said I have it written that men who are liked by men are the best friends for women . In which case , the earl should be worthy of our friendship ; he is liked . Captain Abrane and Sir Meeson , in spite of the hard service he imposes on them with such comical haughtiness , incline to speak well of him , and Methuen Rivers - here for two days on his way to his embassy at Vienna - assured us he is the rarest of gentlemen on the point of honour of his word . They have stories of him , to confirm Livia 's eulogies , showing him punctilious to chivalry : No man alive is like him in that , they say . He grieves me . All that you have to fear is my pity for one so sensitive . So speed , sir ! It is not good for us to be much alone , and I am alone when you are absent .
25891	25896	24296	24296	her	215	' I hear military music !
25897	25975	24296	24296	her	215	' How grand that music makes the dullest world appear in a minute . There is a magic in it to bring you to me from the most dreadful of distances . - Chillon ! it would kill me ! - Writing here and you perhaps behind the hill , I can hardly bear it ; - I am torn away , my hand will not any more . This music burst out to mock me ! Adieu .
25976	25980	24296	24296	her	215	' I am yours .

My College fellows were hawkers , tinkers , tramps and ploughmen , choughs and crows . A volume of our Poets and a History of Philosophy composed my library . I had scarce any money , so I learnt how to idle inexpensively - a good first lesson . We 're

So far , Henrietta will have been satisfied . She can not have found much amusement among dusty troopers or at that court at Carlsruhe . Our French milliner there has helped in retarding her quite against her will . She has had to choose a balldress for the raw mountain - girl they have with them , and get her fitted , and it 's a task ! Why take her to the ball ?

39368	39413	39365	39365	Woodseer	289	' Very well , I do ; there , I give my word . Hang it ! now I know what they mean by " anything for a quiet life . " Just a shake brings us down on that cane - bottomed chair ! '

39422	39431	39365	39365	Woodseer	289	' To - day , yes , yes . '
39444	39456	39440	39440	Abrane	294	' Pop old Chummy in beside the fellow to mount guard . '

Let me ask you , my good sir , are you going to turn ? We 've sat a fairish stretch . I begin to want my bath and a shave , linen and coffee . Thirsty '

Naturally , he was abused for letting his bird fly : but as he was shaven , refreshed , and in clean linen , he could pull his shirt - cuffs and take seat at his breakfast - table with equanimity while Abrane denounced him .

40788	40831	40786	40786	Potts	327	' He 's no new hand and you do n't think him so either , Fleet . I 've looked into the fellow 's eye and seen a leery old badger at the bottom of it . Talks vile stuff . However , '

40871	41001	40847	40847	He	327	' Henrietta Fakenham ! no mistake about her ; driving out from a pothouse ; man beside her , military man ; might be a German . And , if you please , quite unacquainted with your humble servant , though we were as close as you to me . Something went wrong in that pothouse . Red eyes . There had been a scene , one could swear . Behind the lady another carriage , and her maid . Never saw the girl before , and sets to bowing and smirking at me , as if I was the - fellow of all others ! Comical . I made sure they were bound for this place . They were on the Strasburg road . No sign of them ? '
41002	41008	41010	41010	Fleetwood	241	' You speak to me ? '
41023	41034	41035	41035	Fleetwood	241	' You have a bad habit of speaking to yourself , '

41112	41136	41140	41140	she	2276	' How could you choose Russett for such a report as that ! The admiral was on the road behind . Henrietta - you 're

41186	41199	41200	41200	Potts	327	' Oh ! the man ! pretty fair , I dare say , '
41203	41230	41200	41200	Potts	327	' If it was n't Henrietta Fakenham , I see with the back of my head . German girl ! The maid was a German girl . '
41231	41237	41239	41239	Livia	308	' That may well be , '
41440	41454	41428	41428	she	449	' You seem to have had the lion 's share of the parting . '
41455	41464	41472	41472	her	449	' Yes , we passed Mr. Chumley Potts , '
41525	41589	41506	41506	each	1792	' You place particular confidence in Russett 's fidelity to his word , Riette - as you have been hearing yourself called . You should be serious by this time . Russett wo n't bear much more . I counted on the night of the Ball for the grand effect . You will extinguish every woman there - and if he is absent ? '
41590	41596	41506	41506	each	1792	' I shall excuse him . '
41597	41851	41506	41506	each	1792	' You are not in a position to be so charitable . You ought to know your position , and yourself too , a little better than you do . How could you endure poverty ? Chillon Kirby stands in his uniform , and all 's told . He can manoeuvre , we know . He got the admiral away to take him to those reviews cleverly . But is he thinking of your interests when he does it ? He requires twenty years of active service to give you a roof to your head . I hate such allusions . But look for a moment at your character : you must have ordinary luxuries and pleasures , and if you were to find yourself grinding against common necessities - imagine it ! Russett is quite manageable . He is , trust me ! He is a gentleman ; he has more ability than most young men : he can do anything he sets his mind to do . He has his great estates and fortune all in his own hands . We call him eccentric . He is only young , with a lot of power . Add , he 's in love , and some one distracts him . Not love , do you say ? - you look it . He worships . He has no chance given him to show himself at his best . Perhaps he is off again now . Will you bet me he is not ? '
41852	41865	41867	41867	Henrietta	449	' I should incline to make the bet , if I betted , '
41869	41895	41867	41867	Henrietta	449	' His pride is in his word , and supposing he 's in love , it 's with his pride , which never quits him . '
41896	42020	41506	41506	each	1792	' There 's firmness in a man who has pride of that kind . You must let me take you back to Baden . I hold to having you with me to - day . You must make an appearance there . The admiral will bring us his Miss Kirby to - morrow , if he is bound to remain here to - night . There 's no harm in his bachelor dinners . I suspect his twinges of gout come of the prospect of affairs when he lands in England . Remember our bill with Madame Clemence . There wo n't be the ghost of a bank - note for me if Russett quits the field ; we shall all be stranded . '
42024	42037	42021	42021	Henrietta	449	' Does it depend on my going with you to - day ? '
42038	42060	41506	41506	each	1792	' Consider , that he is now fancying a thousand things . We wo n't talk of the road to Paris . '
42069	42091	41506	41506	each	1792	' I will speak to papa : - if he can let me go . He has taken to Miss Kirby . '
42092	42098	42099	42099	Henrietta	449	' Does she taste well ? '
42102	42300	42099	42099	Henrietta	449	' It 's impossible to dislike her . Oh ! she is wild ! She knows absolutely nothing of the world . She can do everything we ca n't - or do n't dare to try . - Men would like her . Papa 's beginning to doat . He says she would have made a first - rate soldier . She fears blood as little as her morning cup of milk . One of the orderlies fell rather badly from a frightened horse close by our carriage . She was out in a moment and had his head on her lap , calling to papa to keep the carriage fast and block the way of the squadron , for the man 's leg was hurt . I really thought we were lost . At these manoeuvres anything may happen , at any instant . Papa will follow the horse - artillery . You know his vanity to be a military quite as much as a naval commander like the Greeks and Romans , he says . We took the bruised man into our carriage and drove him to camp , Carinthia nursing him on the way . '
42301	42344	42099	42099	Henrietta	449	' Carinthia ! She 's well fitted with her name . What with her name and her hair and her build and her singular style of attire , one wonders at her coming into civilized parts . She 's utterly unlike Chillon . '

42656	42704	42642	42644	Sir Meeson Corby	295	' Fleetwood 's tramp ! There he goes . Now see , Miss Fakenham , the kind of object Lord Fleetwood picks up and calls friend ! - calls that object friend ! .. But , what ? He has been to a tailor and a barber ! '
42705	42722	42723	42723	Livia	308	' Stop the coachman . Run , tell Mr. Woodseer I wish him to join us , '

43065	43072	43073	43074	Sir Beeson	339	' Best hotel in the town ! '
43100	43138	43139	43139	Livia	308	' Be so good as to step down and tell the admiral he is to bring Madame Clemence in his carriage to - morrow ; and on your way , you will dismiss Mr. Woodseer 's fly , '

45853	45859	45852	45852	HENRIETTA	449	'S LETTER TREATING OF THE GREAT EVENT
45945	45949	45925	45925	she	449	' Monsieur Du Lac !
45950	45954	45925	45925	she	449	' Grey Dawn . '
46007	46062	45986	45986	knights	2469	' The Ball in every way a success . Grand Duke and Duchess perfect in courtesy , not a sign of the German morgue . Livia splendid . Compared to Day and Night . But the Night eclipses the Day . A summer sea of dancing . Who , think you , eclipsed those two ?
46063	46116	46117	46117	You	2470	' I tell you the very truth when I say your Carinthia did . If you had seen her , - the " poor dear girl " you sigh to speak of , - with the doleful outlook on her fortunes : " portionless , unattractive ! " Chillon , she was magical !
46220	46397	46467	46467	Carinthia	215	' You choose to think , is it Riette who noticed my simple sister so closely before ... ? for I suppose you to be reading this letter a second time and reflecting as you read . In the first place , acquaintance with her has revealed that she is not the simple person - only in her manner . Under the beams of subsequent events , it is true I see her more picturesquely . But I noticed also just a suspicion of the " grenadier " stride when she was on the march to make her curtsey . But Livia had no cause for chills and quivers . She was not the very strange bird requiring explanatory excuses ; she dances excellently , and after the first dance , I noticed she minced her steps in the walk with her partner . She catches the tone readily . If not the image of her mother , she has inherited her mother 's bent for the graces ; she needs but a small amount of practice .
46398	46424	46467	46467	Carinthia	215	' Take my assurance of that ; and you know who has critical eyes . Your anxiety may rest ; she is equal to any station .
46425	46455	46467	46467	Carinthia	215	' As expected by me , my Lord Tyrant appeared , though late , near midnight . I saw him bowing to the Ducal party . Papa had led your '
46516	46556	46499	46499	He	2475	' His word binds him - I hope not fatally ; irrevocably , it certainly does . There is charm of character in that . His autocrat airs can be forgiven to a man who so profoundly respects his word .
46557	46594	46499	46499	He	2475	' It occurred during their third dance . Your Riette was not in the quadrille . O but she was a snubbed young woman last night ! I refrain - the examples are too minute for quotation .
46595	46745	46499	46499	He	2475	' A little later and he had vanished . Carinthia Kirby may already be written Countess of Fleetwood ! His hand was offered and hers demanded in plain terms . Her brother would not be so astounded if he had seen the brilliant creature she was - is , I could say ; for when she left me here , to go to her bed , she still wore the " afterglow . " She tripped over to me in the ball - room to tell me . I might doubt , she had no doubt whatever . I fancied he had subjected her to some degree of trifling . He was in a mood . His moods are known to me . But no , he was precise ; her report of him strikes the ear as credible , in spite of the marvel it insists on our swallowing .
46747	46772	46499	46499	He	2475	' Lord Fleetwood had asked me to marry him . " Neither assurance nor bashfulness ; newspaper print ; aid an undoubting air of contentment .
46773	46778	46499	46499	He	2475	' Imagine me hearing it .
46779	46786	46499	46499	He	2475	' " To be his wife ? "
46787	46793	46499	46499	He	2475	' " He said wife . "
46794	46800	46499	46499	He	2475	' " And you replied ? "
46801	46809	46499	46499	He	2475	' " I - said I would . "
46810	46816	46499	46499	He	2475	' " Tell me all ? "
46817	46825	46499	46499	He	2475	' " He said we were plighted . "
46826	46861	46499	46499	He	2475	' Now , " wife " is one of the words he abhors ; and he loathes the hearing of a girl as " engaged . " However , " plighted " carried a likeness .
46862	46878	46499	46499	He	2475	' I pressed her : " My dear Carinthia , you thought him in earnest ? "
46879	46884	46499	46499	He	2475	' " He was . "
46885	46892	46499	46499	He	2475	' " How do you judge ? "
46893	46902	46499	46499	He	2475	' " By his look when he spoke . "
46903	46910	46499	46499	He	2475	' " Not by his words ? "
46912	46919	46499	46499	He	2475	' I repeat them to you . "
46920	46973	46499	46499	He	2475	' She has repeated them to me here in my bedroom . There is no variation . She remembers every syllable . He went so far as to urge her to say whether she would as willingly utter consent if they were in a church and a clergyman at the altar - rails .
46974	46979	46499	46499	He	2475	' That was like him .
46980	47000	46499	46499	He	2475	' She made answer : " Wherever it may be , I am bound , if I say yes . "
47001	47016	46499	46499	He	2475	' She then adds : " He told me he joined hands with me . "
47017	47024	46499	46499	He	2475	' " Did he repeat the word '
47026	47028	46499	46499	He	2475	' ? "
47029	47036	46499	46499	He	2475	' " He said it twice . "
47037	47075	46499	46499	He	2475	' I transcribe verbatim scrupulously . There can not be an error , Chillon . It seems to show , that he has embraced the serious meaning of the word - or seriously embraced the meaning , reads '
47088	47260	46499	46499	He	2475	' But why wonder so staringly ? They both love the mountains . Both are wildish . She was looking superb . And he had seen her do a daring thing on the rocks on the heights in the early morning , when she was out by herself , unaware of a spectator , he not knowing who she was ; - the Fates had arranged it so . That was why he took to her so rapidly . So he told her . She likes being admired . The preparation for the meeting does really seem " under direction . " She likes him too , I do think . Between her repetitions of his compliments , she praised his tone of voice , his features . She is ready to have the fullest faith in the sincerity of his offer ; speaks without any impatience for the fulfilment . If it should happen , what a change in the fortunes of a girl - of more than one , possibly .
47261	47305	46499	46499	He	2475	' Now I must rest " eyelids fall . " It will be with a heart galloping . No rest for me till this letter flies . Good morning is my good night to you , in a world that has turned over . '
47309	47394	46499	46499	He	2475	' Livia will not hear of it , calls up all her pretty languor to put it aside . It is the same to - day as last night . " Why mention Russett 's nonsense to me ? " Carinthia is as quietly circumstantial as at first . She and the Tyrant talked of her native home . Very desirous to see it ! means to build a mansion there ! " He said it must be the most romantic place on earth . "
47395	47452	46499	46499	He	2475	' I suppose I slept . I woke with my last line to you on my lips , and the great news thundering . He named Esslemont and his favourite - always uninhabited - Cader Argau . She speaks them correctly . She has an unfailing memory . The point is , that it is a memory .
47453	47522	46499	46499	He	2475	' Do not forget also - Livia is affected by her distaste - that he is a gentleman . He plays with his nobility . With his reputation of gentleman , he has never been known to play . You will understand the slightly hypocritical air - it is not of sufficient importance for it to be alluded to in papa 's presence - I put on with her .
47523	47672	46499	46499	He	2475	' Yes , I danced nearly all the dances . One , a princeling in scarlet uniform , appearing fresh from under earth ; Prussian : a weighty young Graf in green , between sage and bottle , who seemed to have run off a tree in the forest , and was trimmed with silver like dew - drops : one in your Austrian white , dragon de Boheme , if I caught his French rightly . Others as well , a list . They have the accomplishment . They are drilled in it young , as girls are , and so few Englishmen - even English officers . How it may be for campaigning , you can pronounce ; but for dancing , the pantalon collant is the perfect uniform . Your critical Henrietta had not to complain of her partners , in the absence of the one .
47673	47719	46499	46499	He	2475	' I shall be haunted by visions of Chillon 's amazement until I hear or we meet . I serve for Carinthia 's mouthpiece , she can not write it , she says . It would be related in two copybook lines , if at all .
47720	47787	46499	46499	He	2475	' The amazement over London ! The jewel hand of the kingdom gone in a flash , to " a raw mountain girl , " as will be said . I can hear Lady Endor , Lady Eldritch , Lady Cowry . The reasonable woman should be Lady Arpington . I have heard her speak of your mother , seen by her when she was in frocks .
47788	47879	46499	46499	He	2475	' Enter the " plighted . " Poor Livia ! to be made a dowager of by any but a damsel of the family . She may well ridicule " that nonsense of Russett 's last night " ! Carinthia kisses , embraces , her brother . I am to say : " What Henrietta tells you is true , Chillon . " She is contented though she has not seen him again and has not the look of expecting to see him . She still wears the kind of afterglow .
47880	47961	46499	46499	He	2475	' Chillon 's Viennese waltz was played by the band : played a second time , special request , conveyed to the leader by Prince Ferdinand . True , most true , she longs to be home across the water . But be it admitted , that to any one loving colour , music , chivalry , the Island of Drab is an exile . Imagine , then , the strange magnetism drawing her there ! Could warmer proof be given ?
47962	47990	46499	46499	He	2475	' Adieu . Livia 's " arch - plotter " will weigh the letter he reads to the smallest fraction of a fraction before he moves a step .
47991	48063	46499	46499	He	2475	' I could leave it and come to it again and add and add . I foresee in Livia 's mind a dread of the aforesaid " arch , " and an interdict . So the letter must be closed , sealed and into the box , with the hand I still call mine , though I should doubt my right if it were contested fervently . I am singing the waltz .
48064	48067	46499	46499	He	2475	' Adieu , '

48081	48390	46499	46499	He	2475	' P.S.-My Lord Tyrant has departed - as on other occasions . The prisoner of his word is sure to take his airing before he presents himself to redeem it . His valet is left to pay bills , fortunately for Livia . She entrusted her purse yesterday to a man picked up on the road by my lord , that he might play for her . Captain Abrane assured her he had a star , and Mr. Potts thought him a rush compere , an adept of those dreadful gambling tables . Why will she continue to play ! The purse was returned to her , without so much as a piece of silver in it ; the man has flown . Sir M. Corby says , he is a man whose hands betray him - or did to Sir M. ; expects to see him one day on the wrong side of the criminal bar . He struck me as not being worse than absurd . He was , in any case , an unfit companion , and our C. would help to rescue the Eccentric from such complicating associates . I see worlds of good she may do . Happily , he is no slave of the vice of gambling ; so she would not suffer that anxiety . I wish it could be subjoined , that he has no malicious pleasure in misleading others . Livia is inconsolable over her pet , young Lord Cressett , whom he yesterday induced to " try his luck " - with the result . We leave , if bills are paid , in two days . Captain Abrane and Mr. Potts left this afternoon ; just enough to carry them home . Papa and your blissful sister out driving . Riette within her four walls and signing herself ,

She admired Kit Ines for his valour : she hated that ruinous and besotting drink . It flung skeletons of a married couple on the wall of the future . Nevertheless her love had been all maternal to him when he lay chastised and disgraced on account of his vice . Pity had done it . Pity not being stirred , her admiration of the hero declared victorious , whose fortunes in uncertainty had stopped the beating of her heart , was eclipsed by gratitude toward his preserver , and a sentiment eclipsed becomes temporarily coldish , against our wish and our efforts , in a way to astonish ; making her think that she can not hold two sentiments at a time ; when it is but the fact that she is unable to keep the two equally warm .

No engagement possible , to teach either French or English . But he was inquisitive touching the urgency . That was my chance . The French are humane when they are not suspicious of you . They are generous , if you put a light to their minds . As I was dealing with a scholarly one , I made use of such ornamental literary skill as I possessed , to prove urgency . He supplied me with bread , fruit , and wine . In the end he procured me pupils . I lodged over a baker 's shop . I had food walks , and learnt something of forestry there - a taking study . When I had saved enough to tramp it home , I said my adieux to that good friend and tramped away , entering London with about the same amount in small coin as when I entered Nancy .

He swears amendment , is hiccupping at night ; fights a match on the morrow , and gets beaten out of formation . No matter : whenever , wherever , that man goes to his fight , that girl follows to nurse him after it . He 's her hero . Women will have one , and it 's their lottery .

Madge drives her cart out , if it 's near town . She 's off down into Kent to - day by coach , Sarah tells me . A great nobleman patronizes Christopher ; a Lord Fleetwood , a lord of wealth . And he must be thoughtful for these people : he sent Sarah word that Christopher should not touch drink . You may remember a butcher Ines in the street next to us . Christopher was a wild lad , always at " best man " with every boy he met : went to sea - ran away . He returned a pugilist . The girl will be nursing him now . I have spoken to her of him ; and I trust to her ; but I mourn her attachment to the man who drinks . '

Leaves her by herself , with only me , after - it knocks me dumb ! Many a man commits a murder would n't do that . She could force him to - no , it is n't a house she wants , she wants him . He 's her husband , Mr. Woodseer . You will do what you can to help ; I judge by your father .

A queer groom . He may keep Kit Ines from drink , he 's one of you men , and rides over anything in his way . I ca n't speak about it ; I could swear it before a judge , from what I know . Those Rundles at that inn do n't hear anything it suits him to do . All the people down in those parts are slaves to him . And I thought he was a real St. George before , - yes , ready I was to kiss the ground his feet crossed . If you could , it 's Chinningfold near where Admiral Fakenham lives , down Hampshire way . Her friends ought to hear what 's happened to her . They 'll find her in a queer place . She might go to the minister 's . I believe she 's happier with us girls . '

An old woman cooks . '

She has to be careful . She taught me how to jump down not to hurt . She makes you feel you can do anything . I had a bother to get her to let me and be quiet herself . She 's not one to put it upon others , you 'll learn . When I was down I felt like a stick in the ground and sat till I had my feet , she at the window waiting ; and I started for you . She kissed her hand . I was to come to you , and then your father , you nowhere seen . I was n't spoken to . I know empty London . '

No , not like a dog , as men say of us . She 'd die for him this night , need were . Live with her , you wo n't find many men match her for brave ; and she 's good . My Sally calls her a Bible saint . I could tell you stories of her goodness , short the time though she 's been down our way . And better there for her than at that inn he left her at to pine and watch the Royal Sovereign come swing come smirk in sailor blue and star to meet the rain - would make anybody disrespect Royalty or else go mad ! He 's a great nobleman , he ca n't buy what she 's ready to give ; and if he thinks he breaks her will now , it 's because she thinks she 's obeying a higher than him , or no lord alive and Kit Ines to back him 'd hold her . Women want a priest to speak to men certain times . I wish I dared ; we have to bite our tongues . He 's master now , but , as I believe God 's above , if he plays her false , he 's the one to be brought to shame . I talk . '

However , she had a voice and a face that led him to be thoughtful over her devotedness to her mistress , after nearly losing her character for the prize - fighter , and he had to thank her for invigorating him .

97095	97099	97088	97088	Potts	333	' clear case . '
97292	97361	97281	97281	Henrietta	449	' I am with Livia to - morrow . Janey starts for Wales to - morrow morning , a voluntary exile . She pleaded to go back to that place where you had to leave her , promising she would not come Westward ; but was persuaded . Lady Arpington approves . The situation was getting too terribly strained . We met and passed my lord in the park .
97362	97552	97281	97281	Henrietta	449	' He was walking his horse - elegant cavalier that he is : would not look on his wife . A woman pulled by her collar should be passive ; if she pulls her way , she is treated as a dog . I see nothing else in the intention of poor Janey 's last offence to him . There is an opposite counsel , and he can be eloquent , and he will be heard on her side . How could she manage the most wayward when she has not an idea of ordinary men ! But , my husband , they have our tie between them ; it may move him . It subdues her - and nothing else would have done that . If she had been in England a year before the marriage , she would , I think , have understood better how to guide her steps and her tongue for his good pleasure . She learns daily , very quickly : observes , assimilates ; she reads and has her comments - would have shot far ahead of your Riette , with my advantages .
97553	97597	97281	97281	Henrietta	449	' Your uncle - but he will bear any charge on his conscience as long as he can get the burden off his shoulders . Do not fret , my own ! Reperuse the above - you will see we have grounds for hope .
97598	97797	97281	97281	Henrietta	449	' He should have looked down on her ! No tears from her eyes , but her eyes were tears . She does not rank among beautiful women . She has her moments for outshining them - the loveliest of spectres ! She caught at my heart . I can not forget her face looking up for him to look down . A great painter would have reproduced it , a great poet have rendered the impression . Nothing short of the greatest . That is odd to say of one so simple as she . But when accidents call up her reserves , you see mountain heights where mists were - she is actually glorified . Her friend - I do believe a friend - the Mr. Woodseer you are to remember meeting somewhere - a sprained ankle - has a dozen similes ready for what she is when pain or happiness vivify her . Or , it may be , tender charity . She says , that if she feels for suffering people , it is because she is the child of Chillon 's mother . In like manner Chillon is the son of Janey 's father .
97798	97928	97281	97281	Henrietta	449	' Mr. Woodseer came every other evening . Our only enlivenment . Livia followed her policy , in refusing to call . We lived luxuriously ; no money , not enough for a box at the opera , though we yearned - you can imagine . Chapters of philosophy read out and expounded instead . Janey likes them . He sets lessons to her queer maid - reading , writing , pronunciation of English . An inferior language to Welsh , for poetical purposes , we are informed . So Janey - determining to apply herself to Welsh , and a chameleon Riette dreading that she will be taking a contrary view of the honest souls - as she feels them to be - when again under Livia 's shadow .
97929	98111	97281	97281	Henrietta	449	' The message from Janey to Scrope 's hotel was despatched half - an - hour after we had driven in from the park ; fruit of a brown meditation . I wrote it - third person - a single sentence . Arrangements are made for her to travel comfortably . It is funny - the shops for her purchases of clothes , necessaries , etc . , are specified ; she may order to any extent . Not a shilling of money for her poor purse . What can be the secret of that ? He does nothing without an object . To me , uniformly civil , no irony , few compliments . Livia writes , that I am commended for keeping Janey company . What can be the secret of a man scrupulously just with one hand , and at the same time cruel with the other ? Mr. Woodseer says , his wealth : - " More money than is required for their needs , men go into harness to Plutus , " - if that is clever .
98112	98471	97281	97281	Henrietta	449	' I have written my husband - as Janey ceases to call her own ; and it was pretty and touching to hear her " my husband . " - Oh ! a dull letter . But he is my husband though he keeps absent - to be longed for - he is my husband still , my husband always . Chillon is Henrietta 's husband , the world cries out , and when she is flattered she does the like , for then it is not too presumptuous that she should name Henrietta Chillon 's wife . In my ears , husband has the sweeter sound . It brings an angel from overhead . Will it bring him one - half hour sooner ? My love ! My dear ! If it did , I should be lisping " husband , husband , husband " from cock - crow to owl 's cry . Livia thinks the word foolish , if not detestable . She and I have our different opinions . She is for luxury . I choose poverty and my husband . Poverty has its beauty , if my husband is the sun of it . Elle radote . She would not have written so dull a letter to her husband if she had been at the opera last night , or listened to a distant street - band . No more - the next line would be bleeding . He should have her blood too , if that were her husband 's - it would never be ; but if it were for his good in the smallest way . Chillon 's wish is to give his blood for them he loves . Never did woman try more to write worthily to her absent lord and fall so miserably into the state of dripping babe from bath on nurse 's knee . Cover me , my lord ; and love , my cause for - no , my excuse , my refuge from myself . We are one ? Oh ! we are one ! - and we have been separated eight and twenty days .

He would not permit . He thinks me blacked by it , like a sweepboy coming from a chimney ; and that I have done injury to his title . No , Riette , to be a true sister , I must bargain with my lord before I submit . He has not cared to come and see his little son . His boy has not offended him . There may be some of me in this dear . I know whose features will soon show to defend the mother 's good name . He is early my champion .

I wish his coming , for him to agree upon the Christian names of the boy . I feel his coming will do me , injury in making me offend him worse . I would avoid that . Oh , dear soul ! I may say it to you : - he can not hurt me any more . I am spared loving him when I forgive him ; and I do . The loving is the pain . That is gone by . '
110887	111147	110878	110879	Mrs. Wythan	457	' Let me say in my turn ; I may help you , dear . You know I have my husband 's love , as he mine . Am I , have I ever been a wife to him ? Here I lie , a dead weight , to be carried up and down , all of a wife that Owain has had for years . I lie and pray to be taken , that my good man , my proved good man , may be free to choose a healthy young woman and be rewarded before his end by learning what a true marriage is . The big simpleton will otherwise be going to his grave , thinking he was married ! I see him stepping about softly in my room , so contented if he does not disturb me , and he crushes me with a desire to laugh at him while I worship . I tricked him into marrying the prostrate invalid I am , and he ca n't discover the trick , he will think it 's a wife he has , instead of a doctor 's doll . Oh ! you have a strange husband , it has been a strange marriage for you , but you have your invincible health , you have not to lie and feel the horror of being a deception to a guileless man , whose love blindfolds him . The bitter ache to me is , that I can give nothing . You abound in power to give . '
111159	111240	110878	110879	Mrs. Wythan	457	' My brother would not want , if I could give . He may have to sell out of . the army , he thinks , fears ; and I must look on . Our mother used to say she had done something for her country in giving a son like Chillon to the British army . Poor mother ! Our bright opening days all seem to end in rain . We should turn to Mr. Wythan for a guide . '

When Mr. Wythan does penance for temper by descending into his mine and working among his men for a day with the pick , seated , as he showed me down below , that is an example . If I did like that , I should have no firedamp in the breast , and not such a task to forgive , that when I succeed I kill my feelings . '

And the earl , my lord , not coming , and he wanting her to move again , seems to her he durstn't do it here and intends to snap at the child on the road . She- 's forced to believe anything of such a husband and father . And why does he behave so ? I ca n't spell it . He 's kind to my Sally - you 've seen the Piccadilly shop ? - because she was ... she did her best in love and duty for my lady . And behaves like a husband hating his wife 's life on earth ! Then he went down with good Mr. Woodseer , and called on Sally , pretending to inquire , after she was kidnapped by that Kit Ines acting to please his paytron , he must be shown up to the room where she slept , and stands at the door and peeps in , Sally 's letter says , and asks if he may enter the room . He went to the window looking on the chimneys she used to see , and touched an ornament over the fireplace , called grandfather 's pigtail case - he was a sailor ; only a ridiculous piece of china , that made my lady laugh about the story of its holding a pigtail . But he turns it over because she did - Sally told him . He could n't be pretending when he bought the beautiful shop and stocked it for Sally . He gets her lots of customers ; and no rent to pay till next Michaelmas a year . She 's a made woman through him .

You read my downright preference of what most people would call poverty , and my enjoyment of good cookery and good company . You enlist among the crew below as one of our tempters . You find I come round to the thing I like best . Therefore , you have your liking for me ; and that 's why you turn to me again , after your natural infidelities . So much for me . You read this priceless lady quite as clearly . You choose to cloud her with your moods . She was at a disadvantage , '

I have thought him hard to deal with ; he is humane . His enormous wealth has been his tempter . Madge and I will owe him our means of livelihood , enough for cottagers , until I carve my way . His feelings are much more independent of his rank than those of most noblemen . He will repeat your kind words to Madge and me ; I am sure of it . He has had heavy burdens ; he is young , hardly formed yet . He needs a helper ; I mean , one allied to him . You forgive me ?

She has given proof she 's a good girl . I do n't see why it should n't end well . That attack on the Welshman 's the bad lookout .

160540	160545	160149	160149	she	6904	' All your heart ? '
160546	160559	160149	160149	she	6904	' My heart is my brother 's until one of us drops . '

160636	160727	160728	160728	he	6909	' By all the saints ! you hit hard . Justly . Not you . Our deeds are the hard hitters . We learn when they begin to flagellate , stroke upon stroke ! Suppose we hold a costly thing in the hand and dash it to the ground - no recovery of it , none ! That must be what your father meant . I ca n't regret you are a mother . We have a son , a bond . How can I describe the man I was ! '
160732	160744	160728	160728	he	6909	' possessed ! sort of werewolf ! You are my wife ? '
160745	160755	160608	160608	she	6905	' I was married to you , my lord . '
160756	160765	160728	160728	he	6909	' It 's a tie of a kind . '
160766	160771	160608	160608	she	6905	' It binds me . '
160772	160778	160728	160728	he	6909	' Obey , you said . '
160779	160786	160608	160608	she	6905	' Obey it . I do . '
160787	160793	160728	160728	he	6909	' You consider it holy ? '
160794	160835	160608	160608	she	6905	' My father and my mother spoke to me of the marriage - tie . I read the service before I stood at the altar . It is holy . It is dreadful . I will be true to it . '

160842	160851	160608	160608	she	6905	' To his name , to his honour . '
160852	160861	160728	160728	he	6909	' To the vow to live with him ? '
160862	160870	160608	160608	she	6905	' My husband broke that for me . '

God has given me a friend , too , - a man of humble heart , my brother 's friend , my dear Rebecca 's husband . He can take them from me : no one but God . See the splendid sky we have . '
161080	161094	161095	161095	he	6911	' I propose to call on Captain Kirby - Levellier tomorrow , Carinthia , '
161098	161105	161095	161095	he	6911	' The name of his house ? '

161156	161174	161095	161095	he	6911	' Here is the church , and here we have to part for today . Do we ? '
161175	161185	161186	161186	she	6910	' Good - bye to you , my lord , '
161199	161213	161189	161189	He	6915	' Your idea is , to return to Esslemont some day or other ? '

163015	163046	163047	163047	Fleetwood	241	' Know him as if I had known him for years . They both come to the mind as faith comes - no saying how ; one swears by them . '

163462	163475	163486	163486	Her	7026	' Not so much to fear while the countess is with us . '
163476	163485	163486	163486	Her	7026	' Fear is not a word for Carinthia . '

164086	164123	164124	164124	Henrietta	449	' Janey is with her brother down at Lekkatts . Things are at a deadlock . A spice of danger , enough to relieve the dulness ; and where there is danger Janey 's at home . '
164129	164207	164127	164127	Janey	366	' Parades with her brother at night ; old military cap on her head ; firearms primed ; sings her Austrian mountain songs or the Light Cavalry call , till it rings all day in my ears - she has a thrilling contralto . You are not to think her wild , my lord . She 's for adventure or domesticity , " whichever the Fates decree . " She really is coming to the perfect tone . '
164208	164213	164215	164216	the earl	797	' Speak of her , '

164285	164339	164270	164270	Henrietta	449	' He belongs to the order of primitive people . His wife - the same pattern , one supposes - pledged them to their Christian names . The man is a simpleton , but a gentleman ; and Janey holds his dying wife 's wish sacred . We are all indebted to him . '

164621	164632	164569	164569	She	449	' And chose - what on earth are you saying ! '
164683	164698	164699	164699	she	449	' Oh yes , and here we have a book of Travels in Spain , '
164702	164716	164699	164699	she	449	' Everything Spanish for Janey now . You are aware ? - no ? '
164726	164748	164749	164749	She	449	' Janey 's latest idea ; only she would have conceived the notion . You solve our puzzle , my lord . '

164869	164881	164882	164882	she	449	' Yes , I hope so - on our way down , '
164886	164902	164882	164882	she	449	' I want you to see the pair of love - birds in a nest . '

164948	164955	164956	164956	she	449	' Very imperious - Mr. Boy ! '
165358	165599	165335	165335	she	449	' You are aware , my dear lord , Janey worships her brother . He was defeated , by some dastardly contrivance , in a wager to do wonderful feats - for money ! money ! money ! a large stake . How we come off our high horses ! I had n't an idea of money before I was married . I think of little else . My husband has notions of honour ; he engaged himself to pay a legacy of debts ; his uncle would not pay debts long due to him . He was reduced to the shift of wagering on his great strength and skill . He could have done it . His enemy managed - enemy there was ! He had to sell out of the army in consequence . I shall never have Janey 's face of suffering away from my sight . He is a soldier above all things . It seems hard on me , but I can not blame him for snatching at an opportunity to win military distinction . He is in treaty for the post of aide to the Colonel - the General of the English contingent bound for Spain , for the cause of the Queen . My husband will undertake to be at the orders of his chief as soon as he can leave this place . Janey goes with him , according to present arrangements . '
165638	165715	165633	165633	she	449	' You have altered that , my lord . She is devoted to her brother ; and her brother running dangers ... and danger in itself is an attraction to her . But her husband will have the first claim . She has her good sense . She will never insist on going , if you oppose . She will be ready to fill her station . It will be - her pride and her pleasure . '
166459	166496	166456	166456	Chillon	449	' It concerns my sister , I have to think . In that case , her wish is to be present . Your lordship will shorten the number of minutes for the interview by permitting it . '

With the interest on that and the sum he tells me he has in the Funds , they keep the wolf from the door - a cottage door . They have their cottage . There 's an old song of love in a cottage . His liking for it makes him seem wiser than his clever sayings . He 'll work in that cottage . '
167493	167541	167624	167625	The earl	797	' They have a good friend to them in you , my lord . It will not be poverty for their simple wants . I hear of the little cottage in Surrey where they are to lodge at first , before they take one of their own . '
167542	167548	167292	167292	Carinthia	215	' We will visit them . '
167549	167561	167624	167625	The earl	797	' When I am in England I shall visit them often . '
167565	167574	167292	167292	Carinthia	215	' The man up here wounded is recovering ? '
167575	167596	167292	167292	Carinthia	215	' Yes , my lord . I am learning to nurse the wounded , with the surgeon to direct me . '

167837	167846	167292	167292	Carinthia	215	' She has weighed them , every one . '
167847	167865	167729	167729	she	7171	' In the event of accidents , the responsibility for having persuaded her would rest on you . '

167880	167905	167729	167729	she	7171	' I proposed it . The persuasion was mine . It is my happiness to be near him , helping , if I can . '

His love for her was the answer ; and her beauty argued for the love . But possessing her , he was bound to win her a name . So his reasoning ran to an accord with his military instincts and ambition . Nevertheless , the mournful strange fact she recalled , that they had never waltzed together since they were made one , troubled his countenance in the mirror of hers .

184655	185283	184589	184589	Carinthia	215	're lambs to vultures with those men . I do n't pretend I was the perfect fool . I thought myself so safe . I let one of them squeeze my hand one day , he swears . You know what a passion is ; you have it for mountains and battles , I for music . I do remember , one morning before sunrise , driving back to town out of Windsor , - a dance , the officers of the Guards , - and my lord 's trumpeter at the back of the coach blowing notes to melt a stone , I found a man 's hand had mine . I remember Lord Fleetwood looking over his shoulder and smiling hard and lashing his horses . But listen - yes , at Calesford it happened . He - oh , hear the name , then ; Chillon must never hear it ; - Lord Brailstone was denied the right to step on Lord Fleetwood 's grounds . The Opera company had finished selections from my Pirata . I went out for cool air ; little Sir Meeson beside me . I had a folded gauze veil over my head , tied at the chin in a bow . Some one ran up to me - Lord Brailstone . He poured forth their poetry . They suppose it the wine for their " beautiful woman . " I dare say I laughed or told him to go , and he began a tirade against Lord Fleetwood . There 's no mighty difference between one beast of prey and another . Let me get away from them all ! Though now ! they would not lift an eyelid . This is my husband 's treasure returning to him . We have to be burnt to come to our senses . Janey - oh ! you do well ! - it was fiendish ; old ballads , melodrama plays , I see they were built on men 's deeds . Janey , I could not believe it , I have to believe , it is forced down my throat ; - that man , your husband , because he could not forgive my choosing Chillon , schemed for Chillon 's ruin . I could not believe it until I saw in the glass this disfigured wretch he has made of me . Livia serves him , she hates him for the tyrant he is ; she has opened my eyes . And not for himself , no , for his revenge on me , for my name to be as my face is . He tossed me to his dogs ; fair game for them ! You do well , Janey ; he is capable of any villany . And has been calling at Livia 's door twice a day , inquiring anxiously ; begs the first appointment possible . He has no shame ; he is accustomed to buy men and women ; he thinks his money will buy my pardon , give my face a new skin , perhaps . A woman swears to you , Janey , by all she holds holy on earth , it is not the loss of her beauty - there will be a wrinkled patch on the cheek for life , the surgeon says ; I am to bear a brown spot , like a bruised peach they sell at the fruit - shops cheap . Chillon 's Riette ! I think of that , the miserable wife I am for him without the beauty he loved so ! I think of myself as guilty , a really guilty woman , when I compare my loss with my husband 's . '

185302	185535	185296	185296	Carinthia	215	' Because , Janey , what have I ever been to Chillon but the good - looking thing he was proud of ? It 's gone . Oh , the accident . Brailstone had pushed little Corby away ; he held my hand , kept imploring , he wanted the usual two minutes , and all to warn me against - I 've told you ; and he saw Lord Fleetwood coming . I got my hand free , and stepped back , my head spinning ; and I fell . That I recollect , and a sight of flames , like the end of the world . I fell on one of the oil - lamps bordering the grass ; my veil lighted ; I had fainted ; those two men saw nothing but one another ; and little Sir Meeson was no help ; young Lord Cressett dashed out the flames . They brought me to my senses for a second swoon . Livia says I woke moaning to be taken away from that hated Calesford . It was , oh ! never to see that husband of yours again . Forgive him , if you can . Not I. I carry the mark of him to my grave . I have called myself " Skin - deep " ever since , day and night - the name I deserve . '
