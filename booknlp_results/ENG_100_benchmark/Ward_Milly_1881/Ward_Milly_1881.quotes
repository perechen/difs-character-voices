228	231	233	233	her	164	" Aunt Emma "
368	373	467	467	she	83	" not Time 's fool-- "
374	383	467	467	she	83	" Or bends with the remover to remove . "
397	415	467	467	she	83	" Milly , come down ! come down directly ! Mother wants you . Do make haste ! "
416	435	467	467	she	83	" I 'm just coming , Olly . Do n't stamp so . Nurse is tying my sash . "
559	573	545	545	she	83	" What 's the matter , Olly ? What made you shout so ? "
574	583	585	587	the little boy	178	" Oh , come along , come along ; "
600	633	585	587	the little boy	178	" Mother wants to tell us something , and she says it 's a nice something , and I kissed her like anyfing ! but she would n't tell me without you . "
670	709	660	668	a lady who was sitting working by the window	183	" Well , monkeys , do n't choke me before I tell you my nice something . Sit on my knee Olly . Now , Milly , guess -- what have father and I just been talking about ? "
710	718	720	720	Milly	83	" Sending Olly to school , perhaps , "
722	732	720	720	Milly	83	" I heard Uncle Richard talking about it yesterday . "
733	743	745	745	Olly	63	" That would n't be such a nice something , "
752	781	745	745	Olly	63	" I would n't like it -- not a bit . Boys do n't never like going to school . I want to learn my lessons with mother . "
782	799	801	802	the lady	184	" I know a little boy that does n't like learning lessons with mother very much , "
806	829	801	802	the lady	184	" But my nice something is n't sending Olly to school , Milly . You 're quite wrong -- so try again . "
830	841	843	843	Milly	83	" Oh , mother ! is it a strawberry tea ? "
845	877	843	843	Milly	83	" The strawberries are just ripe , I know . Gardener told nurse so this morning . And we can have tea on the lawn , and ask Jacky and Francis ! "
878	883	885	885	Oliver	68	" Oh , jolly ! "
899	914	885	885	Oliver	68	" And we 'll gather them ourselves -- won't you let us , mother ? "
915	925	927	928	his mother	185	" But it is n't a strawberry tea even , "
930	944	927	928	his mother	185	" Now , look here , children , what have I got here ? "
945	956	958	958	Milly	83	" It 's a map -- a map of England , "
980	997	927	928	his mother	185	" Well , and what happens when father and I look at maps in the summertime ? "
998	1001	1003	1003	Milly	83	" Why , "
1007	1030	1003	1003	Milly	83	" you and father pack up your things , and go away over the sea , and we stay behind with nurse . "
1031	1043	1045	1045	Olly	63	" I do n't call _ that _ a nice something , "
1051	1063	1065	1065	Milly	83	" Oh , mother , _ are _ you going away ? "
1074	1087	1088	1089	their mother	189	" Yes , Milly , and so 's father , and so 's nurse"--and
1094	1099	1101	1101	Milly	83	" So 's nurse ? "
1126	1137	1108	1108	they	188	" Oh , mother , mother , take us too ! "
1138	1157	1159	1160	their mother	189	" Why , how should father and I get on , travelling about with a pair of monkeys ? "
1176	1187	1159	1160	their mother	189	" we should want a cage to keep them in . "
1188	1217	1108	1108	they	188	" Oh , mother , we 'll be _ ever _ so good ! But where are we going ? Oh , do take us to the sea ! "
1218	1227	1229	1229	Olly	63	" Yes , the sea ! the sea ! "
1237	1281	1229	1229	Olly	63	" we 'll have buckets and spades , and we 'll paddle and catch crabbies , and wet our clothes , and have funny shoes , just like Cromer . And father'll teach me to swim -- he said he would next time . "
1282	1285	1287	1288	Mrs. Norton	70	" No , "
1303	1381	1287	1288	Mrs. Norton	70	" No , we are not going to the sea this summer . We are going to a place mother loves better than the sea , though perhaps you children may n't like it quite so well . We 're going to the mountains . Uncle Richard has lent father and mother his own nice house among the mountains and we 're all going there next week -- such a long way in the train , Milly . "
1382	1387	1389	1389	Olly	63	" What are mountains ? "
1404	1420	1389	1389	Olly	63	" They ca n't be so nice as the sea , mother . Nothing can . "
1421	1428	1430	1430	Milly	83	" They 're humps , Olly , "
1433	1544	1430	1430	Milly	83	" Great , big humps of earth , you know ; earth mixed with stone . And they reach up ever so high , up into the sky . And it takes you a whole day to get up to the top of them , and a whole day to get down again . Does n't it , mother ? Fräulein told me all about mountains in my geography . And some mountains have got snow on their tops all year , even in summer , when it 's so hot , and we 're having strawberries . Will the mountains we 're going to , have snow on them ? "
1545	1601	1389	1389	Olly	63	" Oh , no . The snow mountains are far away over the sea . But these are English mountains , kind , easy mountains , not too high for you and me to climb up , and covered all over with soft green grass and wild flowers , and tiny sheep with black faces . "
1602	1627	1430	1430	Milly	83	" And , mother , is there a garden to Uncle Richard 's house , and are there any children there to play with ? "
1628	1761	1389	1389	Olly	63	" There 's a delightful garden , full of roses , and strawberries and grapes , and everything else that 's nice . And it has a baby river all to itself , that runs and jumps and chatters all through the middle of it , so perhaps Olly may have a paddle sometimes , though we are n't going to the sea . And the gardener has got two little children , just about your age , Aunt Mary says : and there are two more at the farm , two dear little girls , who are n't a bit shy , and will like playing with you very much . But who else shall we see there , Milly ? Who lives in the mountains too , near Uncle Richard ? "
1777	1799	1767	1767	Milly	83	" Aunt Emma , is n't it , mother ? Did n't she come here once ? I think I remember . "
1800	1918	1389	1389	Olly	63	" Yes , she came once , but long ago , when you were quite small . But now we shall see a great deal of her I hope , for she lives just on the other side of the mountain from Uncle Richard 's house , in a dear old house , where I spent many , many happy days when I was small . Great - grandpapa and grandmamma were alive then . But now Aunt Emma lives there quite alone . Except for one creature , at least , an old gray poll - parrot , that chatters away , and behaves as if it were quite sensible , and knew all about everything . "
1919	1929	1931	1931	Olly	63	" Has n't she got any pussies , mother ? "
1933	1961	1389	1389	Olly	63	" Yes , two I believe ; but they do n't get on with Polly very well , so they live in the kitchen out of the way-- "
1962	1970	1972	1972	Olly	63	" I like pussies better than pollies , "
1975	1988	1389	1389	Olly	63	" Why , what do you know about pollies , old man ? "
1989	2006	1389	1389	Olly	63	" Pollies bite , I know they do . There was a polly bited Francis once . "
2007	2014	2016	2016	Milly	83	" Well , and pussies scratch , "
2018	2033	2035	2035	Olly	63	" No , they do n't , not if you 're nicey to them , "
2061	2083	2085	2086	Mrs. Norton	70	" Well , suppose you do n't make up your mind about Aunt Emma 's Polly till you 've seen her , "
2088	2103	2085	2086	Mrs. Norton	70	" Now sit down on the rug there and let us have a talk . "
2130	2139	2141	2141	Olly	63	" I 'll take my cart and horse , "
2143	2174	2141	2141	Olly	63	" and my big ball , and my whistle , and my wheelbarrow , and my spade , and all my books , and the big scrap - book , and-- "
2175	2182	2184	2184	Milly	83	" You ca n't , Olly , "
2186	2238	2184	2184	Milly	83	" Nurse could never pack all those up . There 'd be no room for our clothes . You can take your whistle , and the top , and the picture books , and I can take my dolls . That 'll be quite enough , wo n't it , mother ? "
2239	2243	2245	2246	Mrs. Norton	70	" Quite enough , "
2248	2273	2275	2275	she	70	" If it 's fine weather you 'll see -- you wo n't want any toys . But now , look here , children , "
2281	2296	2275	2275	she	70	" Shall I show you how we are going to get to the mountains ? "
2297	2301	2303	2303	Milly	83	" Oh yes , "
2305	2331	2303	2303	Milly	83	" that 'll be like my geography lesson -- come , Olly . Now mother'll teach _ you _ geography , like Fräulein does me . "
2332	2337	2339	2339	Olly	63	" That 's lessons , "
2346	2377	2339	2339	Olly	63	" not fun a bit . It 's only girls like lessons -- Boys never do -- Jacky does n't , and Francis does n't , and I do n't . "
2378	2398	2400	2401	Mrs. Norton	70	" Never mind about it 's being lessons , Olly . Come and see if it is n't interesting , "
2403	2411	2400	2401	Mrs. Norton	70	" Now , Milly , find Willingham . "
2456	2461	2463	2463	Milly	83	" There it is , "
2474	2482	2484	2485	Mrs. Norton	70	" Quite right . Now look here , "
2502	2523	2484	2485	Mrs. Norton	70	" First of all we shall get into the train and go to a place called -- look , Milly . "
2524	2527	2529	2529	Milly	83	" Bletchley , "
2537	2543	2529	2529	Milly	83	" What an ugly name . "
2544	2551	2553	2554	Mrs. Norton	70	" It 's an ugly place , "
2556	2576	2553	2554	Mrs. Norton	70	" so perhaps it does n't deserve a better name . And after Bletchley -- look again , Milly . "
2577	2580	2582	2582	Milly	83	" Rugby , "
2592	2653	2582	2582	Milly	83	" and then Stafford , and then Crewe -- what a funny name , mother!--and then Wigan , and then Warrington , and then Lancaster . Ox - en - holme , Kendal , Wind - er - mere . Oh , mother , what a long way ! Why , we 've got right to the top of England . "
2654	2908	2909	2910	The children	198	" Stop a bit , Milly , and let me tell you something about these places . First of all we shall get out of the train at Bletchley , and get into another train that will go faster than the first . And it will take us past all kinds of places , some pretty and some ugly , and some big and some small . At Stafford there is an old castle , Milly , where fierce people lived in old days and fought their neighbours . And at Crewe we shall get out and have our dinner . And at Wigan all the trees grow on one side as if some one had come and given them a push in the night ; and at Lancaster there 's another old castle , a very famous one , only now they have turned it into a prison , and people are shut up inside it . Then a little way after Lancaster you 'll begin to see some mountains , far , far away , but first you 'll see something else -- just a little bit of blue sea , with mountains on the other side of it . And then will come Windermere , where we shall get out and drive in a carriage . And we shall drive right into the mountains , Olly , till they stand up all round us with their dear kind old faces that mother has loved ever since she was a baby . "
2945	2952	2954	2954	Olly	63	" Oh ! And , mother , "
2956	2971	2954	2954	Olly	63	" you 'll let us take Spot . She can go in my box . "
2987	3004	3006	3007	Mrs. Norton	70	" Suppose you go and ask Spot first , whether she 'd like it , Olly , "
3270	3286	3261	3261	Francis	67	" How funny , and how dreadful it must be . Poor Jacky and Francis ! "
3297	3302	3261	3261	Francis	67	" Poor Jacky 's mother "
3580	3589	3571	3571	her	83	" a yellow owl in an ivy bush . "
3618	3623	3597	3607	John the gardener , who was rather cross to the children	243	" on them beds , "
3892	3898	3900	3900	she	83	" when I was little , "
4128	4132	4123	4123	John	66	" squealin ' , "
4139	4142	4124	4125	the gardener	1554	" capital good "
4293	4305	4384	4384	nurse	1496	" ' I ca n't do without my toys , Nana ' "
4307	4313	4314	4314	she	83	" I think , Nana , "
4330	4373	4314	4314	she	83	" I will take Katie . Mother always sends us away when we get white faces to make us look nice and red again ; so , perhaps , if I take Katie her colour will come back too , you know . "
4374	4382	4384	4384	nurse	1496	" Perhaps it will , Miss Milly , "
4388	4430	4384	4384	nurse	1496	" anyhow , you had better give me the doll you want directly , for it is time I packed all the toys now . Now , Master Olly , you know I ca n't let you take all those things . "
4485	4519	4482	4482	nurse	1496	" I ca n't do without my toys , Nana . I _ must _ do mischief if you wo n't let me take all my toys ; I ca n't help it . "
4520	4551	4482	4482	nurse	1496	" I have n't got room for half those , Master Olly , and you 'll have ever so many new things to play with when we get to Ravensnest . "
4552	4562	4564	4564	Milly	83	" There 'll be the new children , Olly , "
4566	4578	4564	4564	Milly	83	" and the little rivers and all the funny new flowers . "
4579	4585	4587	4587	Olly	63	" Those are n't toys , "
4594	4603	4587	4587	Olly	63	" I do n't know nothing about them . "
4604	4607	4609	4609	nurse	1496	" Now , "
4618	4644	4609	4609	nurse	1496	" bring me your bricks and your big ball , and your picture - books . There , that 's all I can spare you . "
4645	4650	4652	4652	Olly	63	" Wait one minute , "
4729	4736	4738	4738	nurse	1496	" Why -- Spot ! Spot ! "
4767	4775	4777	4777	nurse	1496	" Master Olly and his tricks again , "
5003	5082	4997	4997	his	63	" Oh ! Nana , she _ did _ make a funny me - ow ! I just said to her , Now , Spottie , _ would n't _ you like to go in my box ? and she said , Yes ; and I made her such a comfy bed , and then I stuck all those frocks on the top of her to keep her warm . Why did you let her out , Nana ? "
5083	5088	5090	5090	Nana	79	" You little mischief , "
5092	5129	5090	5090	Nana	79	" do you know you might have smothered poor little Spot ? And look at all these frocks ; do you think I have got nothing better to do than to tidy up after your tricks ? "
5251	5254	5239	5239	nurse	1496	" wake up krick"--quick
5385	5429	5377	5377	she	1496	" Get into bed again , Master Olly , directly . It is only just six o'clock , and I ca n't have you out of bed till seven . You 'll only be under my feet , and in everybody 's way . "
5430	5444	5446	5446	Olly	63	" Nana , I wo n't be in _ anybody 's _ way , "
5469	5524	5459	5459	his	63	" I ca n't keep still in my bed all such a long time . There 's something inside of me , Nana , keeps jumping up and down , and wo n't let me keep still . Now , if I get up , you know , Nana , I can help you . "
5525	5531	5533	5533	nurse	1496	" Help me , indeed ! "
5554	5586	5533	5533	nurse	1496	" A nice helping that would be . Come back to bed , sir , and I 'll give you some picture - books till I 'm ready to dress you . "
5768	5773	5761	5762	the children	198	" Hurrah ! hurrah ! "
5848	5850	5817	5817	mother	1502	" whew "
6120	6125	6127	6127	Olly	63	" Bletchley , Bletchley ! "
6135	6141	6143	6144	his father	262	" No , my boy , "
6151	6170	6143	6144	his father	262	" we shall stop five more times before we get to Bletchley ; so do n't be impatient . "
6220	6228	6230	6230	Milly	83	" Keep hold of me , Olly , "
6238	6249	6230	6230	Milly	83	" Oh , Nana , do n't let him go ! "
6280	6283	6266	6266	father	1498	" Windermere , "
6297	6311	6313	6313	Olly	63	" That was like lions and bears , was n't it , mother ? "
6331	6335	6313	6313	Olly	63	" lions and bears "
6468	6475	6521	6521	father	1498	" Snow White and Rose Red . "
6543	6547	6521	6521	father	1498	" Lichfield Cathedral . "
6642	6652	6654	6654	nurse	1496	" Come and have a sleep , Master Olly , "
6656	6684	6654	6654	nurse	1496	" You are just tired and hot . This is a long way for little boys , and we 've got ever so far to go yet . "
6685	6693	6695	6695	Olly	63	" I 'm not sleepy , Nana , "
6712	6722	6695	6695	Olly	63	" I 'm going to keep awake like father . "
6723	6732	6734	6735	Mr. Norton	89	" Father 's going to sleep , then , "
6745	6762	6734	6735	Mr. Norton	89	" so you go too , Olly , and see which of us can go quickest . "
6934	6940	6942	6942	father	1498	" Crewe , I declare , "
6950	6974	6942	6942	father	1498	" Why , Olly and I have been asleep nearly an hour ! Wake up , children , it 's dinner - time . "
7326	7446	7310	7310	mother	1502	" Are you very tired , Olly ? Never mind , poor little man , we sha n't be very long now , and we 're all tired , darling -- father 's tired , and I 'm tired ; and look at Milly there , she looks like a little white ghost . Suppose you be brave , and try a little extra hard to be good . Then mother'll love you an extra bit . And what do you think we shall see soon ? such a lovely bit of blue sea with white ships on it . Just you shut your eyes a little bit till it comes , I 'll be sure to tell you . "
7510	7519	7521	7521	Olly	63	" Mother , mother ! what is it ? "
7532	7541	7525	7525	his	63	" is it a fairy palace , mother ? "
7542	7573	7525	7525	his	63	" Perhaps it is , Olly ; anyway , the hill - fairies live there . For those are the mountains , the beautiful mountains we are going to see . "
7574	7586	7588	7588	Milly	83	" But how shall we get across the sea to them ? "
7595	7644	7525	7525	his	63	" This is only a corner of the sea , Milly -- a bay . Do n't you remember bays in your geography ? We ca n't go across it , but we can go round it , and we shall find the mountains on the other side . "
7915	7929	7931	7931	Olly	63	" Mother ! mother ! may we go in those boats some day ? "
7948	7953	7931	7931	Olly	63	said--"Yes , very likely . "
8103	8115	8101	8101	father	1498	out--"Here we are , children , here we are at Ravensnest . "
8237	8256	8259	8259	nurse	1496	" Poor little souls ! How late they are sleeping . They must have been tired last night . "
8308	8311	8312	8312	she	1496	" Milly ! "
8321	8333	8312	8312	she	1496	" Milly , it 's breakfast - time , wake up ! "
8344	8346	8334	8334	Milly	83	" whistles "
8348	8350	8352	8352	her	83	" hedges "
8374	8392	8356	8356	nurse	1496	open--"What is it ? What do you want , Nana ? Where are we?--Oh , I know ! "
8414	8470	8406	8406	her	83	" Yes , there they are ! Come and look , Nana ! There , past those trees -- don't you see the mountains ? And there is father walking about ; and oh ! do look at those roses over there . Dress me quick , dress me quick , please , dear Nana . "
8542	8545	8547	8547	Olly	63	" Milly , "
8555	8570	8547	8547	Olly	63	" I 'm going right up the mountains after breakfast . Are n't you ? "
8571	8581	8583	8583	nurse	1496	" Wait till you see them , Master Olly , "
8592	8613	8583	8583	nurse	1496	" perhaps your little legs wo n't find it quite so easy to climb up the mountains as you think . "
8614	8628	8630	8630	Olly	63	" I can climb up three , four , six , seven mountains , "
8633	8650	8630	8630	Olly	63	" mountains are n't a bit hard . Mother says they 're meant to climb up . "
8651	8666	8668	8668	Milly	83	" Well , I suppose it 's like going up stairs a long way , "
8677	8694	8668	8668	Milly	83	" You did n't like going up the stairs in Auntie Margaret 's house , Olly . "
8755	8769	8750	8750	his	63	" I do n't believe it 's a bit like going up stairs . "
8973	8989	8997	8997	her	83	" Nana , is n't it pretty ? Nana , I think it 's lovely ! "
9182	9230	9173	9174	Mrs. Norton	70	" Aunt Emma sends a few lines just to welcome us , and to say that she ca n't come over to us to - day , but will we all come over to her to - morrow and have early dinner , and perhaps a row afterward-- "
9231	9242	9244	9244	Olly	63	" Oh , a row , mother , a row ! "
9264	9281	9244	9244	Olly	63	" I can row , father said I might . Are we going to - day ? "
9282	9312	9173	9174	Mrs. Norton	70	" No , to - morrow , Olly , when we 've seen a little bit of Ravensnest first . Which of you remembers Aunt Emma , I wonder ? "
9313	9318	9320	9320	Milly	83	" I remember her , "
9327	9357	9320	9320	Milly	83	" she had a big white cap , and she told me stories . But I do n't quite remember her face , mother -- not _ quite _ . "
9358	9369	9371	9371	Olly	63	" I do n't remember her , not one bit , "
9373	9403	9371	9371	Olly	63	" Mother , does she keep saying , ' Do n't do that ; ' ' Go up stairs , naughty boys , ' like Jacky 's aunt does ? "
9438	9442	9431	9431	she	482	" Do n't ! "
9444	9449	9428	9428	They	198	" Go up stairs ! "
9466	9477	9479	9479	mother	1502	" She 's the dearest aunt in the whole world , "
9481	9537	9479	9479	mother	1502	" and she never says , ' Do n't , ' except when she 's obliged , but when she does say it little boys have to mind . When I was a little girl I thought there was nobody like Aunt Emma , nobody who could make such plans or tell such splendid stories . "
9538	9576	9479	9479	mother	1502	" And , mother , ca n't she cut out card dolls ? asked Milly . Do n't you know those beautiful card dolls you have in your drawer at home -- didn't Aunt Emma make them ? "
9577	9652	9479	9479	mother	1502	" Yes , of course she did . She made me a whole family once for my birthday , a father and a mother , and two little girls and two little boys . And each of the children had two paper dresses and two hats , one for best and one for every day -- and the mother had a white evening dress trimmed with red , and a hat and a bonnet . "
9653	9695	9479	9479	mother	1502	" I know , mother ! they 're all in your drawer at home , only one of the little boys has his head broken off . Do you think Aunt Emma would make me a set if I asked her ? "
9696	9766	9479	9479	mother	1502	" I ca n't say , Milly . But I believe Aunt Emma 's fingers are just as quick as ever they were . Now , children , father says he will take you out while I go and speak to cook . Olly , how do you think we 're going to get any meat for you and Milly here ? There are no shops on the mountains . "
9767	9779	9781	9781	Olly	63	" Then we 'll eat fisses , little fisses like those ! "
9803	9809	9811	9812	Mr. Norton	89	" Thank you , Olly , "
9816	9878	9811	9812	Mr. Norton	89	" it would cost a good deal to keep you in trout , sir . I think we 'll try for some plain mutton for you , even if we have to catch the sheep on the mountains ourselves . But now come along till mother is ready , and I 'll show you the river where those little fishes lived . "
10001	10023	10025	10025	Milly	83	" Father , why did that old gentleman at Willingham last week tell mother that it always rained in the mountains ? "
10034	10099	10025	10025	Milly	83	" Well , Milly , I 'm afraid you 'll find out before you go home that it does know how to rain here . Sometimes it rains and rains as if the sky were coming down and all the world were going to turn into water . But never mind about that now -- it is n't going to rain to - day . "
10261	10274	10276	10277	Mr. Norton	89	" What do you think of that for a river , children ? "
10279	10319	10276	10277	Mr. Norton	89	" Very early this morning , when you little sleepyheads were in bed , I got up and came down here , and had my bath over there , look -- in that nice brown pool under the tree . "
10320	10325	10327	10328	both children	501	" Oh , father ! "
10334	10378	10327	10328	both children	501	" Let us have our baths in the river too . Do ask Nana -- do , father ! We can have our bathing things on that we had at the sea , and you can come too and teach us to swim . "
10379	10447	10276	10277	Mr. Norton	89	" Well , just once perhaps , if mother says yes , and it 's very warm weather , and you get up very _ very _ early . But you wo n't like it quite as much as you think . Rivers are very cold to bathe in , and those pretty stones at the bottom wo n't feel at all nice to your little toes . "
10448	10455	10457	10457	Milly	83	" Oh , but , father , "
10459	10468	10457	10457	Milly	83	" we could put on our sand shoes . "
10469	10476	10478	10478	Olly	63	" And would n't we splash ! "
10480	10513	10478	10478	Olly	63	" Nurse wo n't let us splash in our bath , father , she says it makes a mess . I 'm sure it does n't make a _ great _ mess . "
10514	10524	10526	10527	Mr. Norton	89	" What do you know about it , shrimp ? "
10529	10593	10526	10527	Mr. Norton	89	" you do n't have to tidy up . Hush , is n't that mother calling ? Let 's go and fetch her , and then we 'll go and see Uncle Richard 's farm , where the milk you had for breakfast came from . There are three children there , Milly , besides cows and pigs , and ducks and chickens . "
10623	10635	10637	10637	Milly	83	" Oh , mother ! where did you get those roses ? "
10639	10703	10708	10708	Olly	63	" Wheeler , the gardener , gave them to me . And now suppose we go first of all to see Mrs. Wheeler , and gardener 's two little children . They live in that cottage over there , across the brook , and the two little ones have just been peeping over the wall to try and get a look at you . "
10781	10792	10794	10794	Olly	63	" Why , mother , what a lot of rivers , "
10815	10821	10823	10824	Mrs. Norton	70	" Just to begin with , "
10826	10869	10823	10824	Mrs. Norton	70	" You 'll see plenty more before you 've done . But I ca n't have you calling this a river , Olly . These baby rivers are called becks in Westmoreland -- some of the big ones , too , indeed . "
11069	11074	11076	11077	Mrs. Norton	70	" Well , Bessie , "
11083	11089	11076	11077	Mrs. Norton	70	" is your mother in ? "
11090	11093	11095	11095	Bessie	97	" Naw , "
11106	11126	11095	11095	Bessie	97	" Oh , I 'm sorry for that . Do you know when she 's likely to be in ? "
11127	11130	11132	11132	Bessie	97	" Naw , "
11192	11197	11199	11200	Mrs. Norton	70	" What a pity , "
11202	11247	11199	11200	Mrs. Norton	70	" I wanted to ask her a question . Come away , Olly , and do n't tease Charlie if he does n't want to shake hands . Can you remember , Bessie , to tell your mother that I came to see her ? "
11248	11251	11253	11253	Bessie	97	" Yis , "
11255	11291	11199	11200	Mrs. Norton	70	" And can you remember , too , to ask her if she will let you and Charlie come down to tea with Miss Milly and Master Olly , this afternoon , at five o'clock ? "
11292	11295	11297	11297	Bessie	97	" Yis , "
11313	11320	11322	11323	Mrs. Norton	70	" Good - bye , then , "
11325	11332	11334	11334	Milly	83	" Good - bye , Bessie , "
11469	11481	11483	11483	Olly	63	" Mother , _ do _ let me climb up too ! "
11496	11513	11486	11487	Mrs. Norton	70	" I want to climb up krick like that ! Oh , do let me try ! "
11514	11554	11486	11487	Mrs. Norton	70	" No , no , Olly ! come along . We shall never get to the farm if you stay climbing here . And you would n't find it as easy as Charlie does , I can tell you . "
11555	11564	11566	11566	Olly	63	" Why , I 'm bigger than Charlie , "
11575	11626	11486	11487	Mrs. Norton	70	" But you have n't got such stout legs ; and , besides , Charlie is always out of doors all day long , climbing and poking about . I daresay he can do outdoor things better than you can . You 're a little town boy , you know . "
11627	11635	11637	11637	Olly	63	" Charlie 's got a black face , "
11667	11687	11486	11487	Mrs. Norton	70	" Well , you see , he has n't got a Nana always looking after him as you have . "
11688	11698	11700	11700	Olly	63	" Has n't he got _ any _ Nana ? "
11718	11789	11700	11700	Olly	63	" He has n't got any nurse but his mother , and Mrs. Wheeler has a great deal else to do than looking after him . What would you be like , do you think , Olly , if I had to do all the housework , and cook the dinner , and mind the baby , and there was no nurse to wash your face and hands for you ? "
11790	11801	11803	11803	Olly	63	" I should get just like shock - headed Peter , "
11887	11898	11900	11900	Milly	83	" What a funny little girl Bessie is , mother ! "
11902	11929	11900	11900	Milly	83	" Do they always say _ Naw _ and _ Yis _ in this country , instead of saying No and Yes , like we do ? "
11930	11942	11944	11945	Mrs. Norton	70	" Well , most of the people that live here do , "
11947	11986	11944	11945	Mrs. Norton	70	" Their way of talking sounds odd and queer at first , Milly , but when you get used to it you will like it as I do , because it seems like a part of the mountains . "
12085	12095	12096	12096	he	63	" Why are n't the strawberries red , mother ? "
12117	12124	12096	12096	he	63	" Ours at home were ripe . "
12125	12215	12108	12108	somebody	545	" Well , Olly , I suppose the strawberries know best . All I can tell you is , that things always get ripe here later than at Willingham . Their summer begins a little later than ours does , and so everything gets pushed on a little . But there will be plenty by - and - by . And suppose just now , instead of looking at the strawberries , you give just one look at the mountains . Count how many you can see all round . "
12216	12225	12227	12227	Olly	63	" One , two , three , five , "
12229	12256	12258	12258	he	63	" What great big humps ! Should we be able to touch the sky if we got up to the top of that one , mother ? "
12276	12318	12108	12108	somebody	545	" Well , if you were up there just now , you would be all among the clouds , and it would seem like a white fog all round you . So you would be touching the clouds at any rate . "
12333	12347	12108	12108	somebody	545	" Why , mother , we ca n't touch the clouds at home ! "
12348	12362	12364	12365	Mr. Norton	89	" That comes of living in a country as flat as a pancake , "
12367	12429	12364	12365	Mr. Norton	89	" Just you wait till we can buy a tame mountain , and carry it to Willingham with us . Then we 'll put it down in the middle of the garden , and the clouds will come down to sit on the top of it just as they do here . But now , who can scramble over that gate ? "
12787	12801	12803	12804	Mrs. Backhouse	101	her--"I'm sure , ma'am , I 'm very pleased to see you here , "
12806	12877	12803	12804	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" John told me you were come ( only Mrs. Backhouse said ' coom ' ) , and Becky and Tiza went down with their father when he took the milk this morning , hoping they would catch a sight of your children . They have been just wild to see them , but I told them they were n't likely to be up at that time in the morning . "
12878	12884	12886	12887	Mrs. Norton	70	" Where are they now ? "
12889	12902	12886	12887	Mrs. Norton	70	" Mine have been looking out for them as we came along . "
12903	12926	12987	12988	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Well , ma'am , I ca n't say , unless they 're in the cherry - tree . Becky ! Tiza ! "
12929	12931	12886	12887	Mrs. Norton	70	" Yis "
12964	12985	12987	12988	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" You go along that path , missy , and call again . You 'll be sure to find them , "
12995	13021	12987	12988	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" And wo n't you come in , ma'am , and rest a bit ? You 'll be maybe tired with walking this hot day . "
13300	13303	13305	13305	Milly	83	" Becky , "
13315	13329	13305	13305	Milly	83	" will you come down and say how do you do to us ? "
13372	13387	13389	13389	Becky	102	" We came down to the house when fayther took the milk this morning , "
13391	13416	13389	13389	Becky	102	" We thought maybe we 'd see you in the garden . Only Tiza said she 'd run away if she did see you . "
13417	13425	13427	13427	Olly	63	" Why does n't Tiza come down ? "
13436	13443	13427	13427	Olly	63	" I want to see her . "
13481	13490	13491	13491	he	63	" Throw some more ! Throw some more ! "
13547	13554	13556	13556	Becky	102	" She wo n't come down , "
13564	13596	13556	13556	Becky	102	" Maybe she wo n't speak to you for two or three days . And if you run after her she hides in such queer places you can never find her . "
13597	13613	13615	13615	Milly	83	" But mother wants you and her to come to tea with us this afternoon , "
13617	13623	13615	13615	Milly	83	" wo n't Tiza come ? "
13624	13631	13633	13633	Becky	102	" I suppose mother'll make her , "
13635	13650	13633	13633	Becky	102	" but she does n't like it . Have you been on the fell ? "
13655	13692	13651	13651	Milly	83	" Do you mean on the mountain ? No , not yet . We 're going to - morrow when we go to Aunt Emma 's . But we 've been to the river with father . "
13693	13703	13615	13615	Milly	83	" Did you go over the stepping - stones ? "
13704	13707	13709	13709	Milly	83	" No , "
13711	13728	13709	13709	Milly	83	" I do n't know what they are . Can we go this evening after tea ? "
13729	13733	13735	13735	Becky	102	" Oh yes , "
13737	13756	13735	13735	Becky	102	" they 're just close by your house . Does your mother let you go in the water ? "
13779	13781	13777	13777	She	102	" doos "
13783	13786	13777	13777	She	102	" oop , "
13788	13791	13777	13777	She	102	" knaw , "
13793	13796	13777	13777	She	102	" jist , "
13798	13803	13777	13777	She	102	" la - ike , "
13827	13879	13818	13818	she	102	" No , mother does n't let us go in the water here , at least , not unless it 's very warm . We paddle when we go to the sea , and some day father says we may have our bath in the river if it 's very fine . "
13880	13890	13892	13892	Becky	102	" We never have a bath in the river , "
13902	13915	13917	13917	Milly	83	" Do you have your bath in the nursery like we do ? "
13919	13927	13929	13929	Becky	102	" We have n't got a nursery , "
13935	13982	13929	13929	Becky	102	" mother puts us in the toob on Saturday nights . I do n't mind it but Tiza does n't like it a bit . Sometimes she hides when it 's Saturday night , so that mother ca n't find her till it 's too late . "
13983	13994	13996	13996	Milly	83	" Do n't you have a bath except on Saturday ? "
13998	14022	13996	13996	Milly	83	" Olly and I have one every morning . Mother says we should get like shock - headed Peter if we did n't . "
14023	14031	14033	14033	Becky	102	" I do n't know about him , "
14039	14081	13996	13996	Milly	83	" He 's a little boy in a picture - book . I 'll show him you when you come to tea . But there 's mother calling . Come along , Olly . Tiza wo n't come down Becky says . "
14082	14090	14092	14092	Olly	63	" She 's a very rude girl , "
14128	14143	14119	14119	he	63	" I wo n't sit next her when she comes to tea with us . "
14144	14151	14153	14153	Becky	102	" Tiza 's only in fun , "
14155	14184	14153	14153	Becky	102	" she 's always like that . Tiza , are you coming down ? I am going to get baby out , I heard him crying just now . "
14185	14195	14197	14197	Milly	83	" May you take baby out all by yourself ? "
14199	14234	14236	14236	Becky	102	" Why , I always take him out , and I put him to sleep at nights ; and mother says he wo n't go to sleep for anybody as quick as for me , "
14257	14263	14265	14265	Becky	102	" Will you and he , "
14271	14283	14265	14265	Becky	102	" come up this afternoon and help us call the cows ? "
14284	14289	14291	14291	Milly	83	" If we may , "
14293	14298	14291	14291	Milly	83	" who calls them ? "
14299	14304	14306	14306	Becky	102	" Tiza and I , "
14308	14331	14306	14306	Becky	102	" when I 'm a big girl I shall learn how to milk , but fayther says I 'm too little yet . "
14332	14341	14343	14343	Milly	83	" I wish I lived at a farm , "
14365	14368	14358	14358	she	102	" Swish ! "
14426	14437	14439	14440	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Ah , you wo n't catch Tiza , master , "
14446	14472	14439	14440	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" she 's a rough girl , always at some tricks or other -- we think she ought to have been a boy , really . "
14473	14482	14484	14484	Milly	83	" Mother , is n't Becky very nice ? "
14491	14525	14484	14484	Milly	83	" Her mother lets her do such a lot of things -- nurse the baby , and call the cows , and make pinafores . Oh , I wish father was a farmer . "
14526	14548	14550	14551	Mrs. Norton	70	" Well , it 's not a bad kind of life when the sun shines , and everything is going right , "
14553	14580	14550	14551	Mrs. Norton	70	" but I think you had better wait a little bit till the rain comes before you quite make up your mind about it , Milly . "
14609	14633	14586	14586	she	83	" If I could only turn into a little farmer 's girl ! Why do n't people have fairy godmothers now like Cinderella ? "
15248	15256	15281	15281	nurse	1496	" The flowers Milly gathered for her mother "
15793	15804	15806	15806	Milly	83	" Bessie , we are going to Aunt Emma 's , "
15813	15822	15806	15806	Milly	83	" Where are you and Charlie going to ? "
15823	15826	15828	15828	Bessie	97	" Nawhere , "
15858	15871	15806	15806	Milly	83	" Nowhere ! what do you do all the morning , Bessie ? "
15872	15877	15879	15879	Bessie	97	" I doan't know , "
15887	15894	15879	15879	Bessie	97	" sometimes I mind the baby . "
15895	15914	15806	15806	Milly	83	" Do you mind the baby , too ? Dear , dear ! And what does Charlie do ? "
15915	15918	15920	15920	Bessie	97	" Nawthing , "
15923	15930	15920	15920	Bessie	97	" He only makes himself dirty . "
15931	15940	15806	15806	Milly	83	" Do n't you go to school ever ? "
15941	15952	15954	15954	Bessie	97	" No , but mother 's going to send us , "
15975	15986	15954	15954	Bessie	97	" Are you going to be away for all day ? "
15987	16030	15954	15954	Bessie	97	" Yes ; we sha n't be back till quite evening , mother says . Here she is . Good - bye , Bessie ; good - bye , Charlie . Will you come and play with us to - morrow morning ? "
16104	16123	16125	16125	Milly	83	" It _ is _ a little bit like going upstairs , do n't you think , Olly ? "
16140	16152	16154	16154	Olly	63	" No , it is n't a bit like going upstairs , "
16170	16184	16167	16167	he	63	" It 's like -- it 's like -- walking up a house ! "
16194	16197	16220	16220	him	1498	" Hullo ! "
16223	16230	16220	16220	him	1498	" Where are you , father ? "
16231	16234	16220	16220	him	1498	" Hullo ! "
16393	16406	16408	16409	Mr. Norton	89	" Here 's a boy and girl tied up in a knot , "
16420	16430	16408	16409	Mr. Norton	89	" There 's no harm done , is there ? "
16431	16441	16443	16443	Milly	83	" I 've got a bump on my arm , "
16450	16461	16463	16463	Olly	63	" And I 've got a scratch on my nose , "
16468	16480	16482	16483	Mr. Norton	89	" That 's not much for a nice tumble like that , "
16485	16497	16482	16483	Mr. Norton	89	" you would n't mind another , would you , Milly ? "
16498	16503	16505	16505	Milly	83	" Not a bit , "
16513	16519	16505	16505	Milly	83	" Hide again , father . "
16520	16569	16482	16483	Mr. Norton	89	" Another day , not now , for we want to get to Aunt Emma 's . But tomorrow , if you like , we 'll come up here and have a capital game . Only we must choose a nice dry place where there are no bogs . "
16570	16575	16577	16577	Olly	63	" What are bogs ? "
16579	16677	16482	16483	Mr. Norton	89	" Wet places , where your feet go sinking deeper and deeper into the mud , and you ca n't find any stiff firm bit to stand on . Sometimes people sink down and down into a bog till the mud comes right over their head and face and chokes them ; but we have n't got any bogs as bad as that here . Now , children , step along in front . Very soon we shall get to the top of the mountain , and then we shall see wonderful things on the other side . "
16729	16735	16723	16723	mother	1502	" Stags ' horn moss , "
16748	16754	16756	16757	their father	212	" Now look , children , "
16763	16771	16756	16757	their father	212	" Here we are at the top . "
16855	16862	16864	16864	Milly	83	" Look , look , mother ! "
16870	16932	16867	16867	her	83	" there 's Windermere lake , the lake we saw when we were coming from the station . Look at that steamer , with all the people on board ! What funny little black people . And oh , mother , look at that little boat over there ! How can people go out in such a weeny boat as that ? "
16933	17004	16867	16867	her	83	" It is n't such a weeny boat , Milly . It only looks so small because it 's such a long way off . When father and I take you and Olly on the lake , we shall go in a boat just like that . And now , instead of looking so far away , look just down here below you , and tell me what you see . "
17005	17022	17024	17025	the children	198	" Some chimneys , and some trees , and some smoke , ever so far down , "
17027	17035	17024	17025	the children	198	" Is it a house , mother ? "
17036	17087	16867	16867	her	83	" That 's Aunt Emma 's house , the old house where I used to come and stay when I was a little girl , and when your dear great - grandfather and great - grandmother were alive . I used to think it the nicest place in the world . "
17088	17104	17106	17106	Milly	83	" Were you a very little girl , mother , and were you ever naughty ? "
17127	17248	16867	16867	her	83	" I 'm afraid I was very often naughty , Milly . I used to get into great rages and scream , till everybody was quite tired out . But Aunt Emma was very good to me , and took a great deal of pains to cure me of going into rages . Besides , it always did naughty children good to live in the same house with great - grandmamma , and so after a while I got better . Take care how you go , children , it 's very steep just here , and you might soon tumble over on your noses . Olly , take care ! take care ! where _ are _ you going ? "
17331	17342	17344	17346	the little boy	178	" Father , pull me out , pull me out ! "
17430	17437	17441	17441	mother	1502	" Oh , you black boy ! "
17475	17484	17486	17486	Olly	63	" I 've got mud - stockings on , "
17506	17519	17521	17522	Mrs. Norton	70	" You 're a nice respectable boy to take out to dinner , "
17524	17541	17521	17522	Mrs. Norton	70	" I think we 'll leave you on the mountain to have dinner with the sheep . "
17542	17548	17550	17550	Milly	83	" Oh no , father , "
17559	17572	17550	17550	Milly	83	" We can wash him at Aunt Emma 's , you know . "
17573	17584	17586	17587	Mrs. Norton	70	" Do n't go too close to him , Milly ! "
17589	17691	17586	17587	Mrs. Norton	70	" or you 'll get as black as he is . We shall have to put him under the pump at Aunt Emma 's , that 's quite certain . But there 's nothing to wash him with here , so he must just go as he is for a bit . Now , Olly , run along and your feet will soon dry . Father 's going first , you go next , just where he goes , I 'm coming after you , and Milly shall go last . Perhaps in that way we shall get you down safe . "
17692	17704	17706	17706	Olly	63	" Oh , but , mother , look at my flower , "
17713	17720	17706	17706	Olly	63	" Is n't it a beauty ? "
17721	17762	17586	17587	Mrs. Norton	70	" Shall I tell you what it 's called , Olly ? It 's called a butterwort , and it always grows in boggy places ; I would n't advise you to go after one again without asking father first . "
17873	17878	17880	17881	Mrs. Norton	70	" Dear Aunt Emma ! "
17896	17901	17903	17905	the little lady	699	" Well , Lucy , "
17924	17981	17903	17905	the little lady	699	" it _ is _ nice to see you all here . And there 's dear little Milly , I remember her . But where 's Olly ? I 've never seen that small creature , you know . Come , Olly , do n't be shy . Little boys are never shy with Aunt Emma . "
17982	17990	17992	17993	Mr. Norton	89	" Except when they tumble into bogs , "
18014	18054	17992	17993	Mr. Norton	89	" There 's a clean tidy boy to bring to dinner , is n't he , Aunt Emma ? I think I 'll take him to the yard and pump on him a little before we bring him in . "
18066	18140	18055	18056	Aunt Emma	59	" Why , Olly , I think Mother Quiverquake has been catching hold of you . Do n't you know about old Mother Quiverquake , who lives in the bogs ? Oh , I can tell you splendid stories about her some day . But now catch hold of my hand , and keep your little legs away from my dress , and we 'll soon make a proper boy of you again . "
18239	18249	18251	18252	Aunt Emma	59	" This is where my coachman 's wife lives , "
18254	18282	18251	18252	Aunt Emma	59	" and she owns a small boy who might perhaps find you a pair of stockings , Olly , to put on while your own are washed . "
18324	18386	18317	18322	a stout kind - looking woman	711	" Mrs. Tyson , do you think your Johnny could lend my little nephew a pair of his stockings while we get his own washed ? Master Olly has been tumbling into a bog by way of making friends with the mountains , and I do n't quite know how I am to let those legs into my dining - room . "
18387	18418	18307	18308	Aunt Emma	59	" Dear me , ma'am , but Johnny'll be proud if he 's got any clean , but I 'll not answer for it . Wo n't ye come in ? "
18467	18476	18477	18477	he	714	" I 've got bigger legs than Johnny , "
18503	18515	18517	18518	Aunt Emma	59	" Perhaps you eat more bread and milk than Johnny does , "
18524	18542	18517	18518	Aunt Emma	59	" However , most likely Johnny 's stockings will stretch . How 's the baby , Johnny ? "
18543	18553	18555	18557	the little boy	178	" She 's a great deal better , ma'am , "
18577	18591	18517	18518	Aunt Emma	59	" Have you been taking care of her all the morning for mother ? "
18592	18605	18607	18607	Johnny	78	" Yes , ma'am , and she 's never cried but once , "
18610	18638	18517	18518	Aunt Emma	59	" Well done ! Ah ! there comes Mrs. Tyson . Now , Olly , sit up on that chair , and we 'll see to you . "
18702	18710	18712	18713	Mrs. Tyson	108	" Do they feel funny to you ? "
18719	18741	18712	18713	Mrs. Tyson	108	" Never you mind , little master ; I know they 're nice and warm , for I knitted them myself . "
18742	18751	18753	18753	Olly	63	" Mother buys our stockings in the shop , "
18761	18768	18753	18753	Olly	63	" why does n't Mrs. Tyson ? "
18769	18878	18712	18713	Mrs. Tyson	108	" Perhaps we have n't so many shops , or such nice ones here , Olly , as you have at Willingham ; and the people here have always been used to do a great many things for themselves . Some of them live in such lonely places among the mountains that it is very difficult for them to get to any shops . Not very long ago the mothers used to make all the stuffs for their own dresses and their children 's . What would you say , Milly , if mother had to weave the stuff for it every time you had a new dress ? "
18879	18891	18898	18898	her	83	" Mother would n't give me a great many new dresses , "
18901	18910	18893	18893	Milly	83	" I like shops best , Aunt Emma . "
18911	18926	18928	18929	Aunt Emma	59	" Well , I suppose it 's best to like what we 've got , "
19323	19337	19339	19340	Aunt Emma	59	" You know who that is , do n't you , little woman ? "
19349	19352	19354	19354	Milly	83	" Yes , "
19358	19373	19354	19354	Milly	83	" it 's great - grandmamma . I wish we could have seen her . "
19374	19549	19339	19340	Aunt Emma	59	" I wish you could , Milly . She would have smiled at you as she is smiling in the picture and you would have been sure to have loved her ; all little children did . I can remember seeing your mother , Milly , when she was about as old as you , cuddled up in a corner of that sofa over there , in ' grandmamma 's pocket , ' as she used to call it , listening with all her ears to great - grandmamma 's stories . There was one story called ' Leonora ' that went on for years and years , till all the little children in it -- and the little children who listened to it -- were almost grown up ; and then great - grandmamma always carried about with her a wonderful blue - silk bag full of treasures , which we used to be allowed to turn out whenever any of us had been quite good at our lessons for a whole week . "
19550	19558	19560	19560	Milly	83	" Mother has a bag like that , "
19562	19599	19560	19560	Milly	83	" it has lots of little toys in it that father had when he was a little boy . She lets us look at it on our birthdays . Can you tell stories , Aunt Emma ? "
19600	19608	19610	19610	Olly	63	" Tell us about old Mother Quiverquake , "
19622	19628	19630	19631	Aunt Emma	59	" Oh dear , no ! "
19633	19725	19630	19631	Aunt Emma	59	" it 's much too fine to - day for stories -- indoors , at any rate . Wait till we get a real wet day , and then we 'll see . After dinner to - day , what do you think we 're going to do ? Suppose we have a row on the lake to get water - lilies , and suppose we take a kettle and make ourselves some tea on the other side of the lake . What would you say to that , Master Olly ? "
19762	19766	19758	19759	Aunt Emma	59	" Come in ! "
19815	19820	19822	19823	Aunt Emma	59	" Now , children , "
19834	19910	19912	19913	Aunt Emma	59	" let me introduce you to my old friend , Mr. Poll Parrot . Perhaps you thought I lived all alone in this big house . Not at all . Here is somebody who talks to me when I talk to him , who sings and chatters and whistles and cheers me up wonderfully in the winter evenings , when the rains come and make me feel dull . Put him down here , Margaret , "
19926	19939	19912	19913	Aunt Emma	59	" Now , Olly , what do you think of my parrot ? "
19940	19945	19947	19947	Olly	63	" Can it talk ? "
19958	20010	19912	19913	Aunt Emma	59	" It _ can _ talk ; whether it _ will _ talk is quite another thing . Parrots are contradictious birds . I feel very often as if I should like to beat Polly , he 's so provoking . Now , Polly , how are you to - day ? "
20011	20022	19912	19913	Aunt Emma	59	" Polly 's got a bad cold ; fetch the doc-- "
20053	20056	20046	20051	one of the witches in Grimm	756	" Fairy Tales "
20059	20113	20114	20114	Olly	63	" Come , Polly , that 's very well behaved of you ; but you must n't leave off in the middle , begin again . Olly , if you do n't keep your fingers out of the way Polly will snap them up for his dinner . Parrots like fingers very much . "
20204	20209	20211	20212	Aunt Emma	59	" Come , Polly , "
20214	20236	20211	20212	Aunt Emma	59	" what a cross parrot you are . One -- two -- three -- four . Now , Polly , count . "
20237	20248	20250	20250	Polly	72	" Polly 's got a bad cold , fetch the doc-- "
20258	20275	20253	20254	Aunt Emma	59	" One -- two -- six -- seven -- eight -- nine -- two--_Quick _ march ! "
20343	20347	20358	20358	he	761	" Come in ! "
20366	20379	20358	20358	he	761	" Hush -- sh -- sh , cat 's got a mouse ! "
20380	20385	20387	20388	Aunt Emma	59	" Well , Polly , "
20390	20418	20387	20388	Aunt Emma	59	" I suppose she may have a mouse if she likes . Is that all you 've got to tell us ? Polly , where 's gardener ? "
20419	20426	20428	20428	Polly	72	" Get away ! get away ! "
20453	20460	20462	20463	Aunt Emma	59	" That always makes him cross , "
20465	20484	20462	20463	Aunt Emma	59	" he ca n't bear gardener . Come , Polly , do n't get in such a temper . "
20485	20507	20509	20509	Milly	83	" Oh , is n't he like the witches on the broom - sticks in our fairy - book , Olly ? "
20511	20552	20509	20509	Milly	83	" Do n't you think , Aunt Emma , he must have been changed into something ? Perhaps he was a wicked witch once , or a magician , you know , and the fairies changed him into a parrot . "
20553	20647	20462	20463	Aunt Emma	59	" Well , Milly , I ca n't say . He was a parrot when I had him first , twelve years ago . That 's all I know about it . But I believe he 's very old . Some people say he 's older than I am -- think of that ! So you see he 's had time to be a good many things . Well , Polly , good - night . You 're not a nice bird to - night at all . Take him away , Margaret . "
20648	20653	20655	20655	Polly	72	" Jane ! Jane ! "
20666	20678	20658	20659	the maid	755	" Make haste , Jane ! cat 's in the larder ! "
20679	20686	20688	20689	Aunt Emma	59	" Oh , you bad Polly , "
20691	20763	20688	20689	Aunt Emma	59	" you 're always telling tales . Jane 's my cook , Milly , and Polly does n't like cats , so you see he tries to make Jane believe that our old cat steals the meat out of the larder . Good - bye , Polly , good - bye . You 're an ill - natured old bird , but I 'm very fond of you all the same . "
20764	20773	20775	20775	Olly	63	" Do get us a parrot , mother ! "
20788	20807	20809	20810	his mother	185	" How many more things will you want before you get home , Olly , do you think ? "
20815	20850	20809	20810	his mother	185	" Perhaps you 'll want to take home a few mountains , and two or three little rivers , and a bog or two , and a few sheep -- eh , young man ? "
21036	21039	21041	21042	Aunt Emma	59	" Milly , "
21051	21093	21041	21042	Aunt Emma	59	" do you see that little house down there by the water 's edge ? That 's where the boat lives -- we call it a boathouse . Do you think you 'll be frightened of the water , little woman ? "
21094	21103	21105	21105	Milly	83	" No , I do n't think so , "
21114	21163	21105	21105	Milly	83	" I am frightened sometimes , very . Mother calls me a little goose because I run away from Jenny sometimes -- that 's our cow at home , Aunt Emma , but then she 's got such long horns , and I ca n't help feeling afraid . "
21164	21176	21178	21179	Aunt Emma	59	" Well , the lake has n't got horns , Milly , "
21183	21196	21178	21179	Aunt Emma	59	" so perhaps you will manage not to be afraid of it . "
21427	21432	21434	21435	Aunt Emma	59	" Now , children , "
21447	21480	21434	21435	Aunt Emma	59	" suppose you help me to pack up our tea - things . Olly , you go and fetch the spoons , and , Milly , bring the plates one by one . "
21513	21524	21526	21526	Olly	63	" Ai n't I a useful boy , Aunt Emma ? "
21544	21684	21539	21539	he	63	" Very useful , Olly , though our table - cloth wo n't look over tidy at tea if you crumple it up like that . Now , Milly , bring me that tray of bread and the little bundle of salt ; and , Olly , bring me that bit of butter over there , done up in the green leaves , but mind you carry it carefully . Now for some knives too ; and there are the cups and saucers , Milly , look , in that corner ; and there is the cake all ready cut up , and there is the bread and butter . Now have we got everything ? Everything , I think , but the kettle , and some wood and some matches , and these must go in another basket . "
21685	21689	21691	21691	Milly	83	" Aunt Emma , "
21699	21707	21691	21691	Milly	83	" were you ever a fairy godmother ? "
21708	21739	21539	21539	he	63	" Not that I know of , Milly . Would you like me better if I had a wand and a pair of pet dragons , like old Fairy Blackstick ? "
21740	21743	21745	21745	Milly	83	" No , "
21753	21767	21745	21745	Milly	83	" but you do such nice things , just like fairy godmothers do . "
21768	21813	21539	21539	he	63	" Do I , little woman ? Aunt Emma likes doing nice things for good children . But now come along , it 's quite time we were off . Let us go and fetch father and mother . Gardener will bring the baskets . "
21855	21858	21745	21745	Milly	83	" Ariel , "
21974	21985	21987	21987	Olly	63	" Oh ! mother , mother , look up there , "
21989	22005	21987	21987	Olly	63	" there 's the mountain . Is n't that where we climbed up this morning ? "
22180	22194	22196	22196	Milly	83	" Are n't there any water - fairies in this lake , mother ? "
22215	22315	22196	22196	Milly	83	" I ca n't tell , Milly , I never saw any . But there used to be water - fairies in old days . After tea suppose we ask Aunt Emma to tell us a story about a king in olden times whom the water - fairies loved ; she used to tell it to me when I was small , and I liked it best of all stories . But , Olly , you must sit still , or the boat will go tipping over to one side , and father wo n't be able to row . "
22316	22324	22326	22326	Olly	63	" Do let me row , father , "
22328	22368	22196	22196	Milly	83	" Not yet , old man -- I must get used to the boat first , and find out how to manage her , but presently you shall come and try , and so shall Milly if she likes . "
22403	22414	22416	22416	Milly	83	" Father , what a long way we 've come , "
22422	22429	22416	22416	Milly	83	" Where are we going to ? "
22430	22485	22196	22196	Milly	83	" Well , presently , Milly , I am going to turn the boat a little bit , so as to make her go over to that side of the lake over there . Do you see a big rock with some trees on it , far away , sticking out into the lake ? "
22486	22489	22491	22492	the children	198	" Yes , "
22498	22563	22196	22196	Milly	83	" Well , that 's where we 're going to have tea . It 's called Birdsnest Point , because the rocks come out in a point into the lake . But first I thought I would bring you right out into the middle of the lake , that you might see how big it is , and look at the mountains all round . "
22564	22567	22569	22569	Olly	63	" Father , "
22571	22607	22569	22569	Olly	63	" if a big stone fell down out of the sky and made ever such a big hole in the boat , and the water came into the hole , should we all be dead ? "
22608	22654	22196	22196	Milly	83	" I daresay we should , Olly , for I do n't think I could carry mother , and Aunt Emma , and Milly , and you on my back , safe home again , and you see none of you can swim but me . "
22655	22666	22668	22668	Milly	83	" Then I hope a big stone wo n't come , "
22681	22942	22196	22196	Milly	83	" Well , big stones do n't grow in the sky generally , Milly , if that 's any comfort to you . But do you know , one day long ago , when I was out rowing on this lake , I thought all of a sudden I heard some one shouting and screaming , and for a long time I looked and waited , but could see nothing ; till at last I fancied I could see , a long distance off , what looked like a pole , with something white tied to it . And I rowed , and rowed , and rowed , as fast as I could , and all the time the shouting and screaming went on , and at last what do you think I saw ? I saw a boat , which looked as if something was dragging it down into the water . Part of it had already sunk down into the lake , and in the part which was still above the water there were three people sitting , a gentleman , and two little girls who looked about ten years old . And they were shouting ' Help ! help ! ' at the top of their voices , and waving an oar with a handkerchief tied to it . And the boat in which they sat was sinking farther and farther into the water , and if I had'n't come up just when I did , the gentleman and the two little girls would have been drowned . "
22943	22948	22950	22950	Milly	83	" Oh , father ! "
22952	22968	22950	22950	Milly	83	" what made their boat do like that ? And did they get into yours ? "
22969	23168	22196	22196	Milly	83	" There was a great hole in the bottom of their boat , Milly , and the water was coming through it , and making the boat so heavy that it was sinking down and down into the lake , just as a stone would sink if you threw it in . How the hole came there we never quite knew : I thought they must have knocked their boat against a sharp rock -- in some parts of the lake there are rocks under the water which you ca n't see -- and the rock had made the hole ; but other people thought it had happened in some other way . However , there they were , and when I took them all into my boat you never saw such miserable little creatures as the two little girls were . They were wet through , they were as white as little ghosts , and when they were safe in my boat they began to cry and shake so , poor little souls , though their father and I wrapped them up in our coats , that I did want their mother to come and comfort them . "
23169	23197	22950	22950	Milly	83	" Oh , but , father , you took them safe home to their mother , did n't you ? And do tell me what she said . "
23198	23325	22196	22196	Milly	83	" They had no mother , Milly , they had only their father , who was with them . But he was very good to them , and I think on the whole they were happy little girls . The Christmas after that I got a little parcel one morning , and what do you think was in it ? Why , two photographs of the same little girls , looking so neat and tidy and happy , I could hardly believe they were really the same as the little drowned rats I had pulled out of the water . Ask mother to show you the pictures when we get home ; she has them somewhere . Now , Olly , would you like to row ? "
23326	23338	23340	23340	Milly	83	" Oh , father , do n't bump against any rocks , "
23352	23397	23405	23405	mother	1502	" Do n't you trouble your head about rocks , old woman . I know a good deal more about this lake than those little girls ' father did , and I wo n't take you into any harm . Come along , Olly . "
23475	23484	23485	23485	he	63	" Do n't we go fast , father ? "
23499	23514	23485	23485	he	63	" You could n't row so fast without me , could you , father ? "
23515	23526	23528	23529	his father	262	" You little fly - on - the - wheel , "
23535	23543	23528	23529	his father	262	" What does that mean , father ? "
23544	23585	23586	23587	Mr. Norton	89	" Never mind , you 'll know when you 're bigger . But now look , children , how close we are coming to the shore . And quick , Milly , quick ! What do you see over there ? "
23643	23652	23654	23654	Milly	83	" Water - lilies ! water - lilies ! "
23663	23726	23657	23657	her	83	" Oh , mother , look ! it was on one of those leaves that the old toad put little Tiny in my fairy - book , do n't you remember ? Only the little fishes came and bit off the stalk and set her free . Oh , I wish we could see little Tiny sitting on one of those leaves ! "
23727	23730	23732	23733	Aunt Emma	59	" Well , "
23735	23792	23732	23733	Aunt Emma	59	" there 's no saying what you may find in these parts if you look long enough . This is a very strange country . But now , Milly , look out for the lilies . Father 's going to take us in among them , and I 'll hold you , while you gather them . "
23969	23980	23982	23982	Milly	83	" Oh , father , just those two over there ! "
23994	24031	23982	23982	Milly	83	" No , Milly , no more . Look where the sun is now . If we do n't make haste and have our tea , we shall never get back to Ravensnest to - night . "
24099	24112	24113	24113	she	59	" Who 's going to gather me sticks to make my fire ? "
24122	24129	24132	24133	the children	198	" I am ! I am ! "
24153	24165	24140	24140	Milly	83	" And who 's going to lay the table - cloth ? "
24166	24173	24113	24113	she	59	" We are ! we are ! "
24174	24186	24140	24140	Milly	83	" And who 's going to hand the bread and butter ? "
24187	24191	24193	24193	Milly	83	" I am ! "
24195	24203	24193	24193	Milly	83	" and Olly shall hand the cake . "
24204	24218	24140	24140	Milly	83	" And who 's going to _ eat _ the bread and butter ? "
24219	24224	24226	24227	the children	198	" All of us ! "
24233	24250	24230	24230	Milly	83	" Father will want a _ big _ plate of bread and butter , I daresay . "
24251	24263	24265	24266	Mr. Norton	89	" I should think he would , after all this rowing , "
24268	24278	24265	24266	Mr. Norton	89	" Now then , look out for a bump ! "
24282	24299	24265	24266	Mr. Norton	89	" So they put Olly up on a tall piece of rock , and he sang . "
24372	24380	24382	24382	Milly	83	" Oh ! what a nice place ! "
24415	24417	24418	24418	Milly	83	" peninsula "
24648	24658	24660	24660	Olly	63	" Who put these stones here , Aunt Emma ? "
24685	24835	24667	24668	Mr. Norton	89	" Well , Olly , long ago , when all your uncles and aunts were little , and they used to come here for picnics , they thought it would be very nice to have a stone fireplace , built up properly , so that they need n't make one every time . It was Uncle Richard 's idea , and we had such fun building it up . The little ones brought the stones ; and the big ones piled them together till you see we made quite a nice fireplace . And it has lasted ever since . Whenever I come here I mend it up if any of the stones have tumbled down . Numbers of little children come to picnic here every summer , and they always use our fireplace . But now , come along into the woods , children , and gather sticks . "
24909	24915	24917	24918	Mr. Norton	89	" You grasshopper , you ! "
24925	24949	24917	24918	Mr. Norton	89	" do n't you think you 'd better try a whole tree next time ? There , let me break it for you . "
24982	25005	24969	24970	Aunt Emma	59	" That 'll do to begin with , old man . Come along , and you and I 'll light the fire . "
25064	25076	25078	25078	Olly	63	" Have n't we made a blazey fire , Aunt Emma ? "
25094	25097	25099	25100	Mr. Norton	89	" Splendid , "
25114	25139	25099	25100	Mr. Norton	89	" Now , Olly , let me just put you on the top of it to finish it off . How you would fizz ! "
25177	25189	25159	25160	Mr. Norton	89	" Now , Aunt Emma , shall I put him on ? "
25190	25196	25198	25199	Aunt Emma	59	" Oh dear , no ! "
25201	25230	25198	25199	Aunt Emma	59	" my kettle would n't sit straight on him , and it 's just boiling beautifully . We 'll put him on presently when the fire gets low . "
25231	25247	25249	25249	Milly	83	" Olly , do come and help mother and me with the tea - things , "
25265	25271	25273	25274	his father	262	" Run along , shrimp , "
25375	25384	25386	25386	Milly	83	" But we have n't got any flowers , "
25398	25411	25386	25386	Milly	83	" you always have flowers on the table at home , mother . "
25412	25431	25490	25490	Mother	62	" Why , Milly , have you forgotten your water - lilies ; where did you leave them ? "
25432	25438	25440	25440	Milly	83	" Down by the water , "
25442	25489	25440	25440	Milly	83	" Father told me just to put their stalks in the water , and he put a stone to keep them safe . Oh ! that 'll be splendid , mother . Do give me a cup , and we 'll get some water for them . "
25523	25535	25537	25537	Milly	83	" They look rather sad , mother , do n't they ? "
25543	25556	25537	25537	Milly	83	" Perhaps they do n't like being taken away from their home . "
25557	25568	25570	25570	mother	1502	" They never look so beautiful out of the water , "
25572	25630	25570	25570	mother	1502	" but when we get home we 'll put them into a soup - plate , and let them swim about in it . They 'll look very nice then . Now , Olly , fill the cup with water , and we 'll put five or six of the biggest in , and gather some leaves . "
25631	25641	25643	25643	Milly	83	" There , look ! look ! Aunt Emma , "
25662	25670	25643	25643	Milly	83	" Have n't we made it beautiful ? "
25671	25676	25678	25679	Aunt Emma	59	" That you have , "
25691	25703	25678	25679	Aunt Emma	59	" Now for the tea , and then we 're ready . "
25704	25716	25718	25718	Olly	63	" We never had such a nice tea as this before , "
25739	25752	25718	25718	Olly	63	" It 's nicer than having dinner at the railway station even . "
25779	25784	25786	25786	mother	1502	" Well , Olly , "
25788	25805	25786	25786	mother	1502	" I hope we shall often have tea out of doors while we are at Ravensnest . "
25811	25829	25808	25808	her	83	" It 'll rain , mother . That old gentleman said it would be sure to rain . "
25830	25840	25842	25843	Mr. Norton	89	" That old gentleman is about right , Milly , "
25845	25948	25842	25843	Mr. Norton	89	" I think it rains dreadfully here , but mother does n't seem to mind it a bit . Once upon a time when mother was a little girl , there came a funny old fairy and threw some golden dust in her eyes , and ever since then she ca n't see straight when she comes to the mountains . It 's all right everywhere else , but as soon as she comes here , the dust begins to fly about in her eyes , and makes the mountains look quite different to her from what they look to anybody else . "
25949	25956	25958	25958	Olly	63	" Let me look , mother , "
25976	25986	25969	25969	her	70	" I ca n't see any dust , father . "
25987	25998	26000	26001	Mr. Norton	89	" Ah , that 's because it 's fairy dust , "
26005	26027	26000	26001	Mr. Norton	89	" Now , Olly , do n't you eat too much cake , else you wo n't be able to row . "
26028	26038	26040	26040	Milly	83	" It 'll be my turn first , father , "
26042	26053	26040	26040	Milly	83	" you know I have n't rowed at all yet . "
26054	26066	26068	26069	Aunt Emma	59	" Well , do n't you catch any crabs , Milly , "
26071	26078	26080	26080	Milly	83	" Catch crabs , Aunt Emma ! "
26086	26098	26080	26080	Milly	83	" Crabs are only in the sea , are n't they ? "
26099	26110	26112	26113	Mr. Norton	89	" There 's a very big kind just about here , "
26115	26130	26112	26113	Mr. Norton	89	" and they 're always looking out for little children , particularly little girls . "
26131	26139	26141	26141	Milly	83	" I do n't understand , father , "
26149	26157	26159	26160	Mr. Norton	89	" Have some more tea , then , "
26162	26170	26159	26160	Mr. Norton	89	" that always makes people feel wiser . "
26171	26180	26182	26182	Olly	63	" Father , are n't you talking nonsense ? "
26202	26227	26159	26160	Mr. Norton	89	" Very likely , Olly . People always do at picnics . Aunt Emma , when are you going to tell us your story ? "
26228	26240	26242	26243	Aunt Emma	59	" When we 've washed the things and put them away , "
26245	26262	26242	26243	Aunt Emma	59	" then Olly shall sing us two songs , and I 'll tell you my story . "
26356	26362	26364	26364	Milly	83	" I did like that , "
26375	26395	26364	26364	Milly	83	" I wish you 'd let me help Sarah wash up the tea - things at home , mother . "
26396	26412	26414	26415	Mrs. Norton	70	" If Sarah liked to let you , I should n't say no , Milly , "
26417	26461	26414	26415	Mrs. Norton	70	" How soon would you get tired of it , old woman , I wonder ? But come along , let 's put Olly up on a rock , and make him sing , and then we 'll have Aunt Emma 's story . "
26477	26482	26475	26475	he	63	" The Minstrel Boy , "
26484	26488	26475	26475	he	63	" Bonnie Dundee , "
26490	26495	26499	26499	he	63	" Hot Cross Buns , "
26558	26561	26563	26563	Olly	63	" There ! "
26574	26579	26566	26566	he	63	" Hot Cross Buns . "
26580	26607	26566	26566	he	63	" I have singed three whole songs ; and now , Aunt Emma , tell us about the king and the fairies . Krick , please . "
26608	26617	26619	26620	Aunt Emma	59	" It must be ' krick ' indeed , "
26622	26633	26619	26620	Aunt Emma	59	" if we want to get home to - night . "
26672	26677	26666	26667	the rooks	892	" caw , caw , "
26737	26746	26732	26732	they	890	" Good - night ! good - night ! "
26747	26750	26752	26753	Aunt Emma	59	" Well , "
26773	27404	26766	26766	her	59	" Once upon a time there was a great king . He was a good king and a wise man , and he tried to make all the people round about him wiser and better than they were before he came to rule over them ; and for a long time he was very powerful and happy , and he and the brave men who helped him and were his friends did a great deal of good , and kept the savage people who lived all about him in order , and taught them a great many things . But at last some of the savage people got tired of obeying the king , and they said they would not have him to reign over them any more ; so they made an army , and they came together against the king to try and kill him and his friends . And the king made an army too , and there was a great battle ; and the savage people were the strongest , and they killed nearly all the king 's brave men , and the king himself was terribly hurt in the fight . And at last , when night came on , there were left only the king and one of his friends -- his knights , as they were called . The king was hurt so much that he could not move , and his friend thought he was dying . They were left alone in a rocky desert place , and close by there was a great lake with mountains round it -- like this , Olly . It was very cold , and the moon was shining , and the king lay so still that once or twice his friend almost thought that he was dead . But at last , about the middle of the night , he began to speak , and he told his friend to take his sword that was by his side and to go down to the side of the lake and throw it as far as he could into the water . Now , this sword was a magic sword . Long before , the king was once walking beside this lake , when he suddenly saw an arm in a long white sleeve rising out of the lake , and in the hand at the end of it was a splendid sword with a glistening handle . And the king got into a boat and rowed as fast as he could till he got near enough to take hold of the sword , and then the arm sank down under the water and was seen no more . And with the sword the king won a great many battles , and he loved it , and never would part with it ; but now that he was dying , he told his friend to take the sword and throw it back into the lake where he had found it , and see what would happen . And his friend took it , and went away over the rocks till he came to the edge of the lake , and then he took the sword out of its case and swung it above his head that he might throw it far into the water ; but as he lifted it up the precious stones in the handle shone so splendidly in the moonlight that he could not make up his mind to throw it into the water , it seemed such a pity . So he hid it away among the rushes by the water side , and went back to the king . And the king said , ' What did you see by the lake ? '
27405	27427	26766	26766	her	59	" And the knight said , ' I saw nothing except the water , and the mountains , and the rushes . '
27428	27477	26766	26766	her	59	" And the king said , ' Oh , unkind friend ! Why will you not do as I ask you , now that I am dying and can do nothing for myself ? Go back and throw the sword into the lake , as I told you . '
27478	27589	26766	26766	her	59	" And the knight went back , and once more he lifted the sword to throw it into the water but it looked so beautiful that he _ could _ not throw it away . There would be nothing left , he thought , to remember the king by when he was dead if he threw away the sword ; so again he hid it among the rushes , and then he went back to the king . And again the king asked , ' What did you see by the lake ? ' and again the knight answered , ' I saw nothing except the water and the mountains . '
27590	27643	26766	26766	her	59	" ' Oh , unkind , false friend ! ' cried the king , ' you are crueller to me than those who gave me this wound . Go back and throw the sword into the water , or , weak as I am , I will rise up and kill you . '
27644	27774	26766	26766	her	59	" Back went the knight , and this time he seized the sword without looking at it , so that he should not see how beautiful it was , and then he swung it once , twice , thrice , round his head , and away it went into the lake . And as it fell , up rose a hand and arm in a long white sleeve out of the water , and the hand caught the sword and drew it down under the water . And then for a moment , all round the lake , the knight fancied he heard a sound of sobbing and weeping , and he thought in his heart that it must be the water - fairies weeping for the king 's death .
27775	27838	26766	26766	her	59	" ' What did you see by the lake ? ' asked the king again , when he came back , and the knight told him . Then the king told him to lift him up and carry him on his back down to the edge of the lake , and when they got there , what do you think they saw ? "
27860	27930	26766	26766	her	59	" They saw a great black ship coming slowly over the water , and on the ship were numbers of people in black , sobbing and crying , so that the air was full of a sound of weeping , and in front sat three queens in long black dresses , and with gold crowns on their heads , and they , too , were weeping and wringing their hands .
27931	27980	26766	26766	her	59	" ' Lift me up , ' said the king , when the ship came close beside them , ' and put me into the ship . ' And the knight lifted him up , while the three queens stretched out their hands and drew him into the ship .
27981	28053	26766	26766	her	59	" ' Oh , king ! take me with you , ' said the knight , ' take me too . What shall I do all alone without you ? ' But the ship began to move away , and the knight was left standing on the shore . Only he fancied he heard the king 's voice saying , ' Wait for me , I shall come again . Farewell ! '
28054	28145	26766	26766	her	59	" And the ship went faster and faster away into the darkness , for it was a fairy ship , till at last the knight could see it no more . So then he knew that the king had been carried away by the fairies of the lake -- the same fairies who had given him the sword in old days , and who had loved him and watched over him all his life . But what did the king mean by saying , ' I shall come again ' ? "
28156	28164	28166	28166	Milly	83	" What did he mean , auntie ? "
28184	28193	28166	28166	Milly	83	" and did he ever come back again ? "
28194	28239	28166	28166	Milly	83	" Not while the knight lived , Milly . He grew to be quite an old man , and was always hoping that the fairies would bring the king again . But the king never came , and his friend died without seeing him . "
28240	28250	28252	28252	Olly	63	" But did he _ ever _ come again ? "
28254	28298	28166	28166	Milly	83	" I do n't know , Olly . Some people think that he is still hidden away somewhere by the kind water - fairies , and that some day , when the world wants him very much , he will come back again . "
28299	28310	28312	28312	Milly	83	" Do you think he is here in this lake ? "
28319	28333	28335	28336	Aunt Emma	59	" How can we tell what 's at the bottom of the lake ? "
28340	28363	28335	28336	Aunt Emma	59	" But no , I do n't think the king is hidden in this lake . He did n't live near here . "
28364	28370	28372	28372	Milly	83	" What was his name ? "
28374	28409	28410	28410	They	899	" His name was King Arthur . But now , children , hurry ; there is father putting all the baskets into the boat . We must get home as quick as we can . "
28571	28579	28581	28581	Milly	83	" Good - bye , dear lake , "
28603	28626	28585	28585	her	83	" Good - night , mountains ; good - night , Birdsnest Point . I shall soon come and see you again . "
28658	28671	28672	28672	she	59	" Next time , I shall come and see you , Milly , "
28684	28692	28676	28676	she	59	" Do n't forget me till then . "
28693	28704	28706	28706	Olly	63	" Then you 'll tell us about old Mother Quiverquake , "
28715	28737	28706	28706	Olly	63	" Aunt Emma , I have n't given Johnny back his stockings . They did tickle me so in the boat . "
28738	28746	28748	28749	Aunt Emma	59	" We 'll get them some time , "
28751	28760	28748	28749	Aunt Emma	59	" Good - night , good - night . "
29128	29142	29147	29147	he	63	" Why do n't we always get up at five o'clock , father ? "
29165	29173	29162	29163	Mr. Norton	89	" Is n't it nice and funny ? "
29174	29177	29179	29180	Mr. Norton	89	" Very , "
29182	29219	29179	29180	Mr. Norton	89	" Still , I imagine Olly , if you had to get up every day at five o'clock , you might think it funny , but I 'm sure you would n't always think it nice . "
29220	29229	29231	29231	Milly	83	" Oh ! I 'm sure we should , "
29235	29276	29231	29231	Milly	83	" Why , father , it 's just as if everything was ours and nobody else 's , the garden and the river I mean . Is there _ anybody _ up yet do you think -- in those houses ? "
29292	29331	29278	29278	Milly	83	" I ca n't tell , Milly . But I 'll tell you who 's sure to be up now , and that 's John Backhouse . I should think he 's just beginning to milk the cows . "
29332	29343	29345	29345	Milly	83	" Oh then , Becky and Tiza'll be up too , "
29350	29382	29345	29345	Milly	83	" I wish we could see them . Somehow it would be quite different seeing them now , father . I feel so queer , as if I was somebody else . "
29553	29574	29538	29538	he	89	" Now , Olly , give me your hands and jump in . Mind , it 'll feel very cold . "
29641	29657	29659	29659	Olly	63	" Oh , father , fetch Milly , and then we 'll all dance about , "
29661	29666	29668	29669	Mr. Norton	89	" Come , Milly , "
29671	29684	29668	29669	Mr. Norton	89	" Try whether you can manage the stepping - stones by yourself . "
29809	29821	29822	29822	he	63	" I should think the fishes must be frightened of us , "
29831	29840	29822	29822	he	63	" I ca n't see any , father . "
29841	29903	29822	29822	he	63	" Well , they would n't choose to swim about just where little children are shouting and capering . The fishes are hidden safe away under the banks and the big stones . Besides , it 's going to be a very hot day , and they like the shady bits of the river . Just here there 's no shade . "
29972	29981	29983	29984	Mr. Norton	89	" Why , what happened , old woman ? "
29995	30029	29988	29988	his	89	" I -- I -- don't quite know , father ; I was standing on a big stone , and all of a sudden it tipped up , and I tumbled right in . "
30030	30053	30055	30055	Olly	63	" First of all I thought you was a big fish , and then I thought you was going to be drowned , "
30059	30068	30055	30055	Olly	63	" I 'm glad you was n't drowned . "
30069	30076	30078	30078	nurse	1496	" Miss Milly ! Miss Milly ! "
30083	30112	30078	30078	nurse	1496	" it 's quite time you came out now . If you stay in so long you 'll get cold , and you , too , Master Olly . "
30288	30301	30306	30306	she	83	" Oh , Becky ! we 've had such a nice bathe , "
30460	30478	30479	30479	he	89	" I would n't make much of a plan for to - morrow if I were you , "
30485	30493	30479	30479	he	89	" the weather does n't look promising . "
30494	30499	30501	30501	Milly	83	" Oh , father ! "
30505	30532	30501	30501	Milly	83	" There are some red clouds over there -- look ! and Nana always says it 's going to be fine when there are red clouds . "
30533	30554	30479	30479	he	89	" Well , Milly , your red clouds may be right and I may be wrong . We shall see . "
30624	30628	30630	30630	Milly	83	" Oh dear ! "
30638	30677	30633	30633	she	83	" we ca n't go out , and the wild strawberries will get so wet . I meant to have gathered some for mother to - day . There would have been such nice ones in the wood . "
30730	30734	30736	30736	Olly	63	" Nasty rain , "
30746	30764	30736	30736	Olly	63	" Go to Spain . I do n't want you to come and spoil my nicey time . "
30765	30779	30790	30790	he	63	" I am afraid scolding the rain wo n't make it go away , "
30803	30815	30797	30797	his	63	" Now what are we going to do to - day ? "
30816	30822	30824	30824	Milly	83	" I do n't know , "
30841	30878	30824	30824	Milly	83	" Well , we brought _ some _ toys , you know , mother . Olly 's got his top ; I can help him spin it , and I can play with Katie a bit . "
30879	30887	30889	30890	Mrs. Norton	70	" That wo n't take very long , "
30892	30902	30889	30890	Mrs. Norton	70	" Suppose we do some lessons first of all . "
30903	30910	30912	30912	Milly	83	" Oh , mother , lessons ! "
30920	30931	30933	30933	Olly	63	" It 's holidays , mother , it 's holidays , "
30935	30946	30933	30933	Olly	63	" I do n't like lessons -- not a bit . "
30947	31102	31103	31103	Milly	83	" Well , but , Olly , think a bit ; you ca n't spin your top and look at picture - books all day , and I 'm afraid it 's going to rain all day -- it looks very like it . If you come and do some reading and counting with me this morning , I can give you some spills to make , or some letters to tear up for me afterwards . That will save the toys for this afternoon ; and some time this afternoon , if it does n't stop raining , we 'll all have a romp . And as for you , Milly , do n't you think it 's quite time Katie had a new frock ? I believe I can find a beautiful bit of blue silk in my bag , and I 'm sure nurse will show you how to make it . "
31202	31205	31253	31253	mother	1502	" ham , "
31213	31216	31253	31253	mother	1502	" was , "
31244	31248	31236	31236	she	83	" Lucy Gray , "
31344	31370	31320	31321	Mrs. Norton	70	" He was quite sure that h - a - y spelt ' ham ' and s - a - w spelt ' was . ' "
31372	31393	31395	31395	Milly	83	" Why , mother , I never could go all that long way all at once--_really _ , could I ? "
31413	31421	31423	31424	Mrs. Norton	70	" No , Milly , not quite , "
31428	31464	31423	31424	Mrs. Norton	70	" but it 's very easy to go a long way in a pretendy drive . It would only take us about ten minutes that way to get to the other side of the world . "
31465	31473	31475	31475	Olly	63	" How long would it take really ? "
31477	31482	31423	31424	Mrs. Norton	70	" About three months . "
31483	31497	31499	31499	Olly	63	" If we could fly up , and up , ever so far , "
31518	31537	31499	31499	Olly	63	" it would n't take us long . Mother , do n't you wish you was a bird ? "
31538	31553	31423	31424	Mrs. Norton	70	" No , I do n't think so , Olly ; why do you ? "
31554	31611	31499	31499	Olly	63	" Because I should like to go so _ krick _ . Mother , the fly - catchers do fly so krick ; I ca n't see them sometimes when they 're flying , they go so fast . Oh , I do wish father would let me get up a ladder to look at them . "
31612	31621	31623	31623	Milly	83	" No Olly , you 'll frighten them , "
31631	31647	31623	31623	Milly	83	" Besides , father says you 're too little , and you 'd tumble down . "
32035	32042	32044	32044	Milly	83	" Oh , you tiresome rain , "
32061	32093	32044	32044	Milly	83	" Where does it all come from , I wonder ? Wo n't it be wet to - morrow , Nana ? and oh , what is that roaring over there ? "
32094	32100	32102	32102	nurse	1496	" That 's the beck , "
32123	32136	32102	32102	nurse	1496	" The beck ! why , what 's the matter with it ? "
32137	32150	32152	32152	nurse	1496	" It 's the rain has made it so full I suppose , "
32154	32174	32152	32152	nurse	1496	" To - morrow , gardener says , it 'll be over the lawn if the rain goes on . "
32175	32185	32187	32187	Milly	83	" Oh , but it must n't go on , "
32189	32243	32187	32187	Milly	83	" Now , rain , dear rain , good rain , do go away to - night , right away up into the mountains . There 's plenty of room for you up there , and down here we do n't want you a bit . So do be polite and go away . "
32334	32337	32339	32339	Milly	83	" Mother , "
32356	32372	32339	32339	Milly	83	" when we get back to Willingham , do you know what I shall do ? "
32373	32378	32339	32339	Milly	83	" No , Milly . "
32379	32452	32339	32339	Milly	83	" I shall ask you to take me to see that old gentleman -- you know who I mean -- who told you about the rain . And I shall say to him , ' please , Mr. Old Gentleman , at first I thought you were quite wrong about the rain , but afterwards I thought you were quite right , and it does rain dreadfully much in the mountains . ' "
32453	32500	32339	32339	Milly	83	" Very well , Milly . But you have only just had a taste of what the rain can do in the lakes you know , so far . Father and I have been here sometimes when it has rained two or three weeks without stopping . "
32501	32505	32507	32507	Milly	83	" Oh dear ! "
32513	32540	32507	32507	Milly	83	" I like the mountains very much , mother ; but _ do _ you think we 'd better come to Ravensnest again after this year ? "
32541	32548	32550	32551	Mrs. Norton	70	" Oh you ungrateful little woman ! "
32571	32630	32550	32551	Mrs. Norton	70	" Have you forgotten all your happy sunshiny days here , just because it has rained for two ? Why , when I was a little girl , and used to come here , the rainy days never made me love the place a bit the less . I always used to think the fine days made up . "
32631	32644	32646	32646	Milly	83	" But then , mother , you were a nice little girl , "
32660	32704	32646	32646	Milly	83	" Now , I do n't feel a bit nice this morning . It makes me so cross not to be able to go out and get flowers and wild strawberries . And you know at home it hardly ever rains all day . "
32705	32716	32718	32718	Olly	63	" Gardener says sometimes it rains all over the road , "
32720	32776	32718	32718	Olly	63	" and people ca n't walk along , and they have to go right up on the mountains to get past the water place . And sometimes they have to get a boat to take people across . Do you think we shall have to go in a boat to church on Sunday , mother ? "
32777	32882	32646	32646	Milly	83	" Well , we 're a long way off that yet , Olly . It will take a good many days ' rain to flood the roads so deep that we ca n't get along them , and this is only the second rainy day . Come , I do n't think we 've got much to complain of . Now suppose , instead of doing all your lessons this morning , you were presently to write to Jacky and Francis -- you write to Jacky , Milly , and Olly to Francis . Do n't you think that would be a good thing ? "
32883	32889	32891	32891	Milly	83	" Oh yes , yes ! "
32902	32934	32891	32891	Milly	83	" They 'll be so much astonished , mother , for we did n't _ promise _ to write to them . I do n't believe they ever get any letters . "
33714	33725	33726	33726	he	1498	" I have been down to look at the river , "
33732	33800	33726	33726	he	1498	" Keep off , children ! I 'm much too wet to touch . Such rain ! It does know how to come down here ! The water 's over the road just by the stepping - stones . John Backhouse says if it goes on another twenty - four hours like this , there 'll be no getting to Wanwick by the road , on foot . "
33801	33804	33806	33806	Milly	83	" Father , "
33817	33887	33806	33806	Milly	83	" would n't it be dreadful if it went on raining and raining , and if the river came up and up , right up to the drive and into the hall , and we all had to sit upstairs , and the butcher could n't bring us any meat , and John Backhouse could n't bring us any milk , and we all _ died _ of hunger . "
33888	33899	33901	33901	Olly	63	" Then they would put us into some black boxes , "
33914	33941	33901	33901	Olly	63	" and they would put the black boxes into some boats , and take us right away and bury us krick -- wouldn't they , mother ? "
33942	33946	33948	33949	Mr. Norton	89	" Well , but-- "
33975	33994	33970	33970	himself	89	" suppose we got into the boats before we were dead , and rowed away to Windermere station ? "
33995	34001	34003	34003	Milly	83	" Oh no ! father , "
34017	34065	34003	34003	Milly	83	" they would n't know anything about us till we were dead you know , and then they 'd come and find us , and be _ very _ sorry for us , and say , ' Oh dear ! oh dear ! what a pity ! ' "
34208	34223	34225	34225	Milly	83	" Or you might go to Willingham , you know , dear Mr. Rain , "
34227	34274	34225	34225	Milly	83	" I daresay mother 's flowers want a good watering . And there 's Spot -- you might give her a good washing -- she _ can _ wash herself , but she wo n't . Only we do n't want you here , Mr. Rain . "
34342	34345	34347	34347	Becky	102	" tarns , "
34590	34597	34599	34599	he	63	" to make them get red kricker "
34684	34693	34695	34696	Mrs. Norton	70	" Pick up the pieces , old woman , "
34708	34717	34695	34696	Mrs. Norton	70	" What 's the matter with you both ? "
34718	34725	34727	34727	Milly	83	" Olly 's spoilt my doll , "
34729	34748	34727	34727	Milly	83	" and it _ will _ go on raining -- and I feel so -- so -- dull . "
34749	34759	34761	34761	Olly	63	" I did n't spoil her doll , mother , "
34765	34798	34761	34761	Olly	63	" I only rubbed some jam on its cheeks to make them a nicey pink -- only some of it _ would _ sticky her dress -- I did n't mean to . "
34799	34813	34815	34816	Mrs. Norton	70	" How would you like some jam rubbed on your cheeks , sir ? "
34836	34875	34815	34816	Mrs. Norton	70	" Suppose you leave Milly 's dolls alone for the future ; but cheer up , Milly ! I think I can make Katie very nearly right again . Come upstairs to my room and we 'll try . "
35018	35025	35027	35027	Olly	63	" A carriage ! a carriage ! "
35049	35052	35058	35058	them	1081	" cars , "
35066	35072	35074	35075	Mrs. Norton	70	" It 's Aunt Emma , "
35080	35103	35074	35075	Mrs. Norton	70	" how good of her to come over on such a day . Run , children , and open the front door . "
35165	35172	35174	35174	Olly	63	" Aunt Emma ! Aunt Emma ! "
35188	35202	35183	35183	his	63	" _ are _ you come to tell us about old Mother Quiverquake ? "
35203	35255	35183	35183	his	63	" You gipsy , do n't strangle me ! Well , Lucy dear , here I am . Will you have me to dinner ? I thought we 'd all be company for each other this bad day . Why , Milly , what have you been doing to your cheeks ? "
35256	35262	35264	35264	Olly	63	" She 's been crying , "
35280	35287	35269	35269	Milly	83	" because I stickened her doll . "
35288	35397	35183	35183	his	63	" Well , and quite right too . Dolls were n't made to be stickied . But now , who 's going to carry my bag upstairs ? Take it gently , Milly , it 's got my cap inside , and if you crumple my cap I shall have to sit with my head in a bandbox at dinner . Old ladies are _ never _ seen without their caps you know . The most dreadful things would happen if they were ! Olly , you may put my umbrella away . There now , I 'll go to mother 's room and take off my things . "
35624	35634	35636	35637	Aunt Emma	59	" I put my head out of the window , "
35639	35875	35636	35637	Aunt Emma	59	" and said to my old coachman , ' Now , John , if it 's going to get any deeper than this , you 'd better turn him round and go home , for I 'm an old woman , not a fish , and I ca n't swim . Of course , if the horse can swim with the carriage behind him it 's all right , but I have my doubts . ' Now John , my dears , has been with me a great many years , and he knows very well that I 'm rather a nervous old woman . It 's very sad , but it is so . Do n't you be nervous when you 're old people . So all he said was ' All right , ma'am . Bless you , he can swim like a trout . ' And crack went the whip , splash went the water ! It seemed to me it was just going to come in under the door , when , lo and behold ! there we were safe and sound on dry ground again . But whether my old horse swam through or walked through I ca n't tell you . I like to believe he swam , because I 'm so fond of him , and one likes to believe the creatures one loves can do clever things . "
35876	35892	35894	35894	Olly	63	" I 'll ask John when he comes to take you away , Aunt Emma , "
35896	35911	35894	35894	Olly	63	" I do n't believe horses can swim when they 're in a carriage . "
35912	35923	35925	35926	Aunt Emma	59	" You 're a matter - of - fact monkey , "
35928	35936	35925	35926	Aunt Emma	59	" Dear me , what 's that ? "
35990	35999	36001	36002	Aunt Emma	59	" What a strange house you live in , "
36010	36026	36001	36002	Aunt Emma	59	" You must have caught a magician somehow . That 's a magician 's squeak . "
36032	36039	36041	36041	Olly	63	" I know , I know ! "
36043	36061	36041	36041	Olly	63	" It 's Aunt Emma 's bag ! I 'm sure it came out of the bag . "
36062	36064	36001	36002	Aunt Emma	59	" My bag!"--holding
36072	36102	36001	36002	Aunt Emma	59	" Now does it look like a bag that squeaks ? It 's a perfectly well - behaved bag , and never did such a thing in its life . "
36103	36110	36112	36112	Olly	63	" I know , Aunt Emma , "
36121	36130	36112	36112	Olly	63	" You 've got the parrot in there ! "
36131	36135	36137	36138	Aunt Emma	59	" Well now , "
36140	36202	36137	36138	Aunt Emma	59	" This is really serious . If you think I am such a cruel old woman as to shut up a poor poll - parrot in a bag , there 's no help for it , we must open the bag . But it 's a very curious bag -- I would n't stand too near it if I were you . "
36319	36331	36333	36333	Milly	83	" What is it , Aunt Emma ? Is it alive ? "
36377	36384	36386	36387	Aunt Emma	59	" You 'd better ask it , "
36410	36424	36386	36387	Aunt Emma	59	" I 'm sure it looks very peaceable just now , poor thing . "
36479	36487	36489	36490	Mr. Norton	89	" Take hold of it , Milly , "
36509	36518	36489	36490	Mr. Norton	89	" Turn it over on its legs again . "
36519	36527	36529	36529	Olly	63	" No , I 'll turn it , "
36598	36609	36611	36611	Milly	83	" Oh , Aunt Emma , is it a toy ? "
36627	36654	36611	36611	Milly	83	" Well , Milly , I believe so -- a very lively one . Bring it here , and I 'll tell you something about it . "
36728	36743	36745	36746	Aunt Emma	59	" And there never was such a toy as froggy for a wet day , "
36748	36836	36745	36746	Aunt Emma	59	" I have tried him on all sorts of boys and girls , and he never fails . He 's as good a cure for a cross face as a poultice is for a sore finger . But , Milly , listen ! I declare there 's something else going on in my bag . I really think , my dear bag , you might be quiet now that you have got rid of froggy ! What can all this chattering be about ? Sh ! sh ! "
36892	36895	36897	36898	Aunt Emma	59	" Yes , "
36900	36997	36897	36898	Aunt Emma	59	" It 's just as I thought . The bag declares it 's not his fault at all , but that if I will give him such noisy creatures to carry I must take the consequences . He says there 's a whole family now inside him , making such a noise he can hardly hear himself speak . It 's enough , he says , to drive a respectable bag mad , and he must blow up if it goes on . Dear me ! I must look into this . Milly , come here ! "
37010	37046	37003	37004	Aunt Emma	59	" Now , Milly , I 'll hold it for fear it should take it into its poor head to blow up , and you put your hand in and see what you can find . "
37247	37257	37259	37259	Milly	83	" Oh , Aunt Emma , dear Aunt Emma ! "
37275	37305	37266	37266	she	83	" They 're just like mother 's at home , mother 's that you made for her when she was a little girl -- only ever so many more . "
37306	37397	37266	37266	she	83	" Well , Milly , I made mother 's for her long ago , when it rained for days and days without stopping , and she had grown tired of pretty nearly everything and everybody indoors ; and now I have been spending part of these rainy days in making a new set for mother 's little girl . There , dear little woman , I think you must have given me a kiss for each of them by this time . Suppose you try and make them stand up . "
37398	37404	37406	37406	Olly	63	" But , Aunt Emma , "
37427	37427	37406	37406	Olly	63	"
37428	37435	37437	37438	Aunt Emma	59	" I know nothing about it , "
37452	37480	37437	37438	Aunt Emma	59	" You _ might _ ask the bag -- but it would n't answer you . Magical bags never do talk except to their masters or mistresses . "
37959	37972	37974	37974	Olly	63	" _ Now , _ can you remember about old Mother Quiverquake ? "
37999	38010	37951	37951	Milly	83	" ' Suppose we have a story - telling game ' "
38012	38071	37951	37951	Milly	83	" Well , I daresay I shall begin to remember about her presently ; but suppose , children , we have a _ story - telling game _ . We 'll tell stories -- you and Olly , father , mother , and everybody . That 's much fairer than that one person should do all the telling . "
38072	38077	38079	38079	Milly	83	" We could n't , "
38086	38101	38082	38082	her	83	" we are only little children . Little children ca n't make up stories . "
38102	38108	38110	38110	mother	1502	" Suppose little children try , "
38112	38135	38110	38110	mother	1502	" I think Aunt Emma 's is an excellent plan . Now , father , you 'll have to tell one too . "
38136	38141	38143	38144	Mr. Norton	89	" Father 's lazy , "
38153	38173	38143	38144	Mr. Norton	89	" But , perhaps , if you all of you tell very exciting stories you may stir him up . "
38174	38179	38181	38181	Olly	63	" Oh , father ! "
38201	38220	38181	38181	Olly	63	" tell us about the rat with three tails , and the dog that walked on its nose . "
38221	38227	38229	38230	Mr. Norton	89	" Oh dear , no ! "
38232	38262	38229	38230	Mr. Norton	89	" those wo n't do for such a grand story - telling as this . I must think of some story which is all long words and good children . "
38263	38270	38272	38272	Milly	83	" _ Do n't _ father , "
38276	38300	38272	38272	Milly	83	" it 's ever so much nicer when they get into scrapes , you know , and tumble down , and all that . "
38301	38307	38309	38310	Aunt Emma	59	" Who 's to begin ? "
38312	38339	38309	38310	Aunt Emma	59	" I think mother had better begin . Afterwards it will be your turn , Olly ; then father , then Milly , and then me . "
38340	38357	38359	38360	Mrs. Norton	70	" I do n't believe I 've got a scrap of a story in my head , "
38362	38372	38359	38360	Mrs. Norton	70	" It 's weeks since I caught one last . "
38373	38380	38382	38383	Aunt Emma	59	" Then look here , Olly , "
38385	38436	38382	38383	Aunt Emma	59	" I 'll tell you what to do . Go up gently behind mother , and kiss her three times on the top of the head . That 's the way to send the stories in . Mother will soon begin to feel one fidgeting inside her head after that . "
38486	38489	38490	38490	she	70	" Ah ! "
38495	38588	38490	38490	she	70	" Now I think I 've caught one . But it 's a very little one , poor little thing . And yet , strange to say , though it 's very little , it 's very old . Now , children , you must be kind to my story . I caught him first a great many years ago in an old book , but I am afraid you will hardly care for him as much as I did . Well , once upon a time there was a great king . "
38589	38597	38599	38599	Olly	63	" Was it King Arthur , mother ? "
38603	38630	38490	38490	she	70	" Oh no ! this king lived in a different country altogether . He lived in a beautiful hot country over the sea , called Spain . "
38631	38642	38644	38644	Milly	83	" Oh , mother ! a _ hot _ country ! "
38646	38655	38644	38644	Milly	83	" that 's where the rain goes to . "
38656	39099	38490	38490	she	70	" Well , Milly , I do n't think you know any more about it , except that you _ tell _ the rain to go there . Do n't you know by this time that the rain never does what it 's told ? Really , very little rain goes to Spain , and in some parts of the country the people would be very glad indeed if we could send them some of the rain we do n't want at Ravensnest . But now , you must n't interrupt me , or I shall forget my story -- Well there was once a king who lived in a _ very _ hot part of Spain , where they do n't have much rain , and where it hardly ever snows or freezes . And this king had a beautiful wife , whom he loved very much . But , unluckily , this beautiful wife had one great fault . She was always wishing for the most unreasonable and impossible things , and though the king was always trying to get her what she wanted she was never satisfied , and every day she seemed to grow more and more discontented and exacting . At last , one day in the winter , a most extraordinary thing happened . A shower of snow fell in Cordova , which was the name of the town where the king and queen lived , and it whitened the hills all around the town , so that they looked as if somebody had been dusting white sugar over them . Now snow was hardly ever seen in Cordova , and the people in the town wondered at it , and talked about it a great deal . But after she had looked at it a little - while the queen began to cry bitterly . None of her ladies could comfort her , nor would she tell any of them what was the matter . There she sat at her window , weeping , till the king came to see her . When he came he could not imagine what she was crying about , and begged her to tell him why . ' I am weeping , ' she said , sobbing all the time , ' because the hills -- are not always -- covered with snow . See how pretty they look ! And yet -- I have never , till now , seen them look like that . If you really loved me , you would manage some way or other that it should snow once a year at any rate . '
39100	39132	38644	38644	Milly	83	" ' But how can I make it snow ? ' cried the king in great trouble , because she would go on weeping and weeping , and spoiling her pretty eyes .
39133	39166	38490	38490	she	70	" ' I 'm sure I do n't know , ' said the queen , crossly , ' but you ca n't love me a bit , or you 'd certainly try . '
39167	39427	38644	38644	Milly	83	" Well , the king thought and thought , and at last he hit upon a beautiful plan . He sent into all parts of Spain to buy almond trees , and planted them on the hills all round the town . Now the almond tree , as you know , has a lovely pinky - white blossom , so when the next spring arrived all these thousands of almond trees came out into bloom all over the hills round Cordova , so that they looked at a distance as if they were covered with white snow . And for once the queen was delighted , and could not help saying a nice ' Thank you ' to the king for all the trouble he had taken to please her . But it was not very long before she grew discontented again , and began once more to wish for all kinds of ridiculous things . One day she was sitting at her window , and she saw some ragged little children playing by the river that ran round the palace . They were dabbling in the mud at the side , sticking their little bare feet into it , or scooping up pieces which they rolled into balls and threw at one another . The queen watched them for some time , and at last she began to weep bitterly . One of her maidens ran and told the king that the queen was weeping , and he came in a great hurry to see what was the matter .
39428	39502	38490	38490	she	70	" ' Just look at those children down there ! ' said the queen , sobbing and pointing to them . ' Did you ever see anybody so happy ? Why ca n't I have mud to dabble in too , and why ca n't I take off my shoes and stockings , and amuse myself like the children do , instead of being so dull and stuck - up all day long ? '
39503	39549	38644	38644	Milly	83	" ' Because it is n't proper for queens to dabble in the mud , ' said the poor king in great perplexity , for he did n't at all like the idea of his beautiful queen dabbling in the mud with the little ragged children .
39550	39598	38490	38490	she	70	" ' That 's just like you , ' said the queen , beginning to cry faster than ever , ' you never do anything to please me . What 's the good of being proper ? What 's the good of being a queen at all ? '
39599	39712	38644	38644	Milly	83	" This made the king very unhappy , and again he thought and thought , till at last he hit upon a plan . He ordered a very large shallow bath of white marble to be made in the palace - garden . Then he poured into it all kinds of precious stones , and chips of sweet - smelling wood , besides a thousand cartloads of rose - leaves and a thousand cartloads of orange flowers . All these he ordered to be stirred up together with a great ivory spoon , till they made a kind of wonderful mud , and then he had the bath filled up with scented water .
39713	39934	38490	38490	she	70	" ' Now then , ' he said to the queen , when he had brought her down to look at it , ' you may take off your shoes and stockings and paddle about in this mud as much as you like . ' You may imagine that this was a very pleasant kind of mud to dabble in , and the queen and her ladies amused themselves with it immensely for some time . But nothing could keep this tiresome queen amused for long together , and in about a fortnight she had grown quite tired of her wonderful bath . It seemed as if the king 's pains had been all thrown away . She grew cross and discontented again , and her ladies began to say to each other , ' What will she wish for next , I wonder ? The king might as well try to drink up the sea as try to get her all she wants . ' At last , one day , when she and her ladies were walking near the palace , they met a shepherdess driving a flock of sheep up into the hills . The shepherdess looked so pretty and bright in her red petticoat and tall yellow cap , that the queen stopped to speak to her .
39935	39954	38644	38644	Milly	83	" ' Where are you going , pretty maiden , with your woolly white sheep ? ' she asked .
39955	40066	38490	38490	she	70	" ' I am going up to the hills , ' said the shepherdess . ' Now the sun has scorched up the fields down below we must take our sheep up to the cool hills , where the grass is still fresh and green . Good - day , good - day , the sheep are going so fast I can not wait . ' So on she tripped , singing and calling to her sheep , who came every now and then to rub their soft coats against her , as if they loved her . The queen looked after her , and her face began to pucker up .
40067	40128	38644	38644	Milly	83	" ' Why am I not a shepherdess ? ' she exclaimed , bursting into tears . ' I _ hate _ being a queen ! I never sang as merrily as that little maiden in all my life . I must and will be a shepherdess , and drive sheep up into the mountain , or I shall die ! "
40129	40181	38490	38490	she	70	" And all that night the foolish queen sat at her window crying , and when the morning came she had made herself look quite old and ugly . When the king came to see her he was dreadfully troubled , and begged her to tell him what was the matter now .
40182	40225	38644	38644	Milly	83	" ' I want to be a shepherdess , and drive sheep up into the mountains , ' sobbed the queen . ' Why should the little shepherdess girls look always so happy and merry , while I am dying of dulness ? '
40226	40280	38490	38490	she	70	" The king thought it was very unkind of her to say she was dying of dulness when he had taken so much trouble to get her all she wanted ; but he knew it was no good talking to her while she was in such a temper . So all he said was :
40281	40321	38644	38644	Milly	83	" ' How can I turn you into a shepherdess ? These shepherdesses stay out all night with their sheep on the hills , and live on water and a crust of bread . How would you like that ? '
40322	40389	38490	38490	she	70	" ' Of course I - should like it , ' said the queen , ' anything for a change . Besides , nothing could be nicer than staying out of doors these lovely nights . And as for food , you know very well that I am never hungry here , and that it does n't matter in the least to me what I eat ! '
40390	40441	38644	38644	Milly	83	" ' Well , ' said the king , ' you shall go up to the hills , if you promise to take your ladies with you , and if you will let me send a tent to shelter you at night , and some servants to look after you . '
40442	40490	38490	38490	she	70	" ' As if that would give me any pleasure ! ' said the queen , ' to be followed about and waited upon is just what I detest . I will go alone ; just like that pretty little shepherdess , if I go at all . '
40491	40555	38644	38644	Milly	83	" But the king declared that nothing would induce him to let her go alone . So the queen set to work to cry , and she cried for two days and two nights without stopping , and at the end of that time the poor king was ready to let her go anywhere or do anything for the sake of a little peace .
40556	40619	38490	38490	she	70	" So she had her own way . They found her a flock of the loveliest white sheep , all with blue ribbons round their necks , and blue rosettes on their little white tails ; and the queen dressed herself up in a red silk petticoat and a cap embroidered in gold and silver , and then she set out by herself .
40620	40831	38644	38644	Milly	83	" At first it was all delightful . She drove the sheep up the soft green hillsides , and laughed with delight to see them nibbling the fresh grass , and running hither and thither after her , and after each other . The evening sun shone brightly , and she sat herself down on a rock and sang all the tunes she knew , that she might be just like the little shepherdess . But while she was singing the sheep strayed away , and she had to run after them as fast as she could , to catch them up . This made her hot and tired , so she tried to make them lie down under a chestnut tree , that she might rest beside them . But the sheep were not a bit tired , and had no mind to rest at all . While she was calling one set of them together the other set ran scampering off , and the queen found out that she must just give up her way for once and follow theirs . On went the sheep , up hill and down dale , nibbling and frisking and trotting to their hearts ' content , till the queen was worn out .
40832	40919	38490	38490	she	70	" At last , by the time the sun was setting , the poor queen was so tired that she could walk no longer . Down she sat , and the ungrateful sheep kicked up their little hind legs and trotted away out of sight as fast as they could trot . There she was left on the hillside all alone . It began to get dark , and the sky , instead of being blue and clear as it had been , filled with black clouds .
40920	40959	38644	38644	Milly	83	" ' Oh dear ! oh dear ! ' sighed the queen , ' here is a storm coming . If I could only find my way down the hill , if I could only see the town ! '
40960	41215	38490	38490	she	70	" But there were trees all about her , which hid the view , and soon it was so dark there was nothing to be seen , not even the stars . And presently , crash came the thunder , and after the thunder the rain -- such rain ! It soaked the queen 's golden cap till it was so heavy with water she was obliged to throw it away , and her silk petticoat was as wet as if she had been taking a bath in it . In vain she ran hither and thither , trying to find a way through the trees , while the rain blinded her , and the thunder deafened her , till at last she was forced to sink down on the ground , feeling more wretched and frightened and cold than any queen ever felt before . Oh , if she were only safe back in her beautiful palace ! If only she had the tent the king wanted to send with her ! But there all night she had to stay , and all night the storm went on , till the queen was lying in a flood , and the owls and bats , startled out of their holes , went flying past her in the dark , and frightening her out of her senses . When the morning came there was such a shivering , crumpled up queen sitting on the grass , that even her own ladies would scarcely have known her .
41216	41256	38644	38644	Milly	83	" ' Oh , husband ! husband ! ' she cried , getting up and wringing her cold little hands . ' You will never find me , and your poor wicked wife will die of cold and hunger . '
41257	41378	38490	38490	she	70	" Tirra - lirra ! tirra - lirra ! What was that sounding in the forest ? Surely -- surely -- it was a hunting horn . But who could be blowing it so early in the cold gray morning , when it was scarcely light ? On ran the queen toward where the sound came from . Over rocks and grass she ran , till , all of a sudden , stepping out from behind a tree , came the king himself , who had been looking for her for hours . And then what do you think the discontented queen did ? She folded her hands , and hung her head , and said , quite sadly and simply :
41379	41423	38644	38644	Milly	83	" ' Oh , my lord king , make me a shepherdess really . I do n't deserve to be a queen . Send me away , and let me knit and spin for my living . I have plagued you long enough . '
41424	41482	38490	38490	she	70	" And suddenly it seemed to the king as if there had been a black speck in the queen 's heart , which had been all washed away by the rain ; and he took her hands , and led her home to the palace in joy and gladness . And so they lived happy ever afterward . "
41483	41493	41495	41495	Milly	83	" Thank you _ very _ much , mother , "
41512	41525	41495	41495	Milly	83	" Do you really think the queen was never discontented any more ? "
41526	41539	41541	41542	Mrs. Norton	70	" I ca n't tell you any more than the story does , "
41544	41580	41541	41542	Mrs. Norton	70	" You see there would always be that dreadful night to think about , if she ever felt inclined to be ; but I daresay the queen did n't find it very easy at first . "
41581	41591	41593	41593	Olly	63	" I would have made her be a shepherdess , "
41600	41610	41593	41593	Olly	63	" She was n't nice , not a bit . "
41611	41616	41618	41619	Aunt Emma	59	" Little Mr. Severity ! "
41626	41635	41618	41619	Aunt Emma	59	" It 's your turn next , Olly . "
41636	41644	41646	41646	Olly	63	" Then Milly must kiss me first , "
41751	41764	41744	41744	he	63	" Once upon a time there was a daddy - long - legs-- "
41765	41768	41770	41770	Milly	83	" Well , "
41785	41793	41795	41795	Olly	63	" I do n't know any more , "
41797	41806	41808	41808	Milly	83	" Oh , that _ is _ silly , "
41810	41837	41808	41808	Milly	83	" why , that is n't a story at all . Shut your eyes tight , that 's much the best way of making a story . "
41859	41872	41855	41855	he	63	" Once upon a time there was a daddy - long - legs-- "
41876	41889	41891	41891	Milly	83	" Was it a _ good _ daddy - long - legs ? "
41899	41902	41904	41904	Olly	63	" Yes , "
41906	41926	41904	41904	Olly	63	" that 's it , Milly . Once upon a time there was a good daddy - long - legs-- "
41927	41935	41937	41937	Milly	83	" Well , what did he do ? "
41941	41953	41955	41955	Olly	63	" He -- he -- flewed on to father 's nose ! "
41977	42117	42119	42119	Olly	63	" And father said , ' Who 's that on my nose ? ' and the daddy - long - legs said , ' It 's me , do n't you know ? ' And father said , ' Get away off my nose , I do n't like you a bit . ' And the daddy - long - legs said , ' I sha n't go away . It 's hot on the window , the sun gets in my eyes . I like sitting up here best . ' So father took a big sofa - cushion and gave his nose _ ever _ such a bang ! And the daddy - long - legs tumbled down dead . And the cushion tumbled down dead . And father tumbled down dead . And that 's all , "
42131	42138	42140	42140	Milly	83	" Oh , you silly boy ! "
42142	42153	42140	42140	Milly	83	" that is n't a bit like a real story . "
42191	42200	42202	42203	the children	198	" Father 's turn ! father 's turn ! "
42312	42325	42327	42327	Milly	83	" Father , it is n't fair , I do n't think , "
42339	42365	42327	42327	Milly	83	" Of course little people ca n't _ make _ big people do things , so the big people ought to do them without making . "
42366	42377	42379	42380	Mr. Norton	89	" That 's not at all good reasoning , Milly , "
42399	42425	42379	42380	Mr. Norton	89	" You ca n't _ make _ nurse stand on her head , but that 's no reason why nurse should stand on her head . "
42471	42475	42477	42478	Mr. Norton	89	" Dear me ! "
42494	42541	42477	42478	Mr. Norton	89	" This is very serious . Aunt Emma , that spell of yours is really _ too _ strong . My poor head ! It will certainly burst if I do n't get this story out directly ! Come , jump up , children -- quick ! "
42573	42573	42553	42554	Mr. Norton	89	"
42574	42577	42579	42579	Milly	83	" Father , "
42581	42601	42579	42579	Milly	83	" I shall soon be getting tired of ' Once upon a time there was a great king . ' "
42602	42640	42553	42554	Mr. Norton	89	" Do n't cry till you 're hurt , Milly ; which means , wait till I get to the end of my sentence . Well , once upon a time there was a great -- hero . "
42641	42647	42649	42649	Olly	63	" What is a hero ? "
42651	42655	42657	42657	Milly	83	" I know , "
42661	42680	42657	42657	Milly	83	" it 's a brave man that 's always fighting and killing giants and dragons and cruel people . "
42681	42689	42691	42692	Mr. Norton	89	" That 'll do to begin with , "
42694	43052	42691	42692	Mr. Norton	89	" though , when you grow older , you will find that people can be heroes without fighting or killing . However , the man I am going to tell you about was just the kind of hero you 're thinking of , Milly . He loved fighting with giants and dragons and wild people , and my story is going to be about two of his fights -- the greatest he ever fought . The name of this hero was Beowulf , and he lived in a country called Sweden ( Milly knows all about Sweden , Olly , and you must get her to show it you on the map ) , with a number of other brave men who were his friends , and helped him in his battles . And one day a messenger came over the sea from another country close by , called Denmark , and the messenger said , ' Which of all you brave men will come over and help my master , King Hrothgar , who is in sore trouble ? ' And the messenger told them how Hrothgar , for many years past , had been plagued by a monster -- the hateful monster Grendel -- half a man and half a beast , who lived at the bottom of a great bog near the king 's palace . Every night , he said , Grendel the monster came out of the bog with his horrible mother beside him -- a wolf - like creature , fearful to look upon -- and he and she would roam about the country , killing and slaying all whom they met . Sometimes they would come stalking to the king 's palace , where his brave men were sleeping round the fire in the big hall , and before anyone could withstand him Grendel would fall upon the king 's warriors , kill them by tens and twenties , and carry off their dead bodies to his bog . Many a brave man had tried to slay the monster , but none had been able so much as to wound him .
43053	43459	42553	42554	Mr. Norton	89	" When Beowulf and his friends had heard this story they thought a while , and then each said to the other , ' Let us go across the sea and rid King Hrothgar of this monster . ' So they took ship and went across the sea to Hrothgar 's country , and Hrothgar welcomed them royally , and made a great feast in their honour . And after the feast Hrothgar said to Beowulf , ' Now , I give over to you the hall of my palace , that you may guard it against the monster . ' So Beowulf and the brave men who had come over with him made a great fire in the hall , and they all lay down to sleep beside it . You may imagine that they did not find it very easy to get to sleep , and some of them thought as they lay there that very likely they should never see their homes in Sweden again . But they were tired with journeying and feasting , and one after another they all fell asleep . Then in the dead of the night , when all was still , Grendel rose up out of the bog , and came stalking over the moor to the palace . His eyes flamed with a kind of horrible light in the darkness , and his steps seemed to shake the earth ; but those inside the palace were sleeping so heavily that they heard nothing , not even when Grendel burst open the door of the hall and came in among them . Before anyone had wakened , the monster had seized one of the sleeping men and torn him to pieces . Then he came to Beowulf ; but Beowulf sprang up out of his sleep and laid hold upon him boldly . He used no sword to strike him , for there was no sword which men could make was strong enough to hurt Grendel ; but he seized him with his strong hands , and the two struggled together in the palace . And they fought till the benches were torn from the walls , and everything in the hall was smashed and broken . The brave men , springing up all round , seized their swords and would gladly have helped their lord , but there was no one but Beowulf could harm Grendel .
43460	43566	42691	42692	Mr. Norton	89	" So they fought , till at last Beowulf tore away Grendel 's hand and arm , and the monster fled away howling into the darkness . Over the moor he rushed till he came to his bog , and there he sank down into the middle of the bog , wailing and shrieking like one whose last hour was come . Then there was great rejoicing at Heorot , the palace , and King Hrothgar , when he saw Grendel 's hand which Beowulf had torn away , embraced him and blessed him , and he and all his friends were laden with splendid gifts .
43567	43755	42553	42554	Mr. Norton	89	" But all was not over yet . When the next night came , and Hrothgar 's men and Beowulf 's men were asleep together in the great hall , Grendel 's horrible mother , half a woman and half a wolf , came rushing to the palace and while they were all asleep she carried off one of Hrothgar 's dearest friends -- a young noble whom he loved best of all his nobles . And she killed him , and carried his body back to the bog . Then the next morning there was grief and weeping in Heorot ; but Beowulf said to the king , ' Grieve not , O king ! till we have found out Grendel 's mother and punished her for her evil deeds . I promise you she shall give an account for this . She shall not be able to hide herself in the water , nor under the earth , nor in the forest , nor at the bottom of the sea ; let her go where she will , I will find a way after her . '
43756	43991	42691	42692	Mr. Norton	89	" So Beowulf and his friends put on their armour and mounted their horses , and set out to look for her . And when they had ridden a long and weary way over steep lonely paths and past caves where dragons and serpents lived , they came at last to Grendel 's bog -- a fearful place indeed . There in the middle of it lay a pool of black water , and over the water hung withered trees , which seemed as if they had been poisoned by the air rising from the water beneath them . No bird or beast would ever come near Grendel 's pool . If the hounds were hunting a stag , and they drove him down to the edge , he would sooner let them tear him to pieces than hide himself in the water . And every night the black water seemed to burn and flame , and it hissed and bubbled and groaned as if there were evil creatures tossing underneath . And now when Beowulf and his men came near it , they saw fierce water dragons lying near the edge or swimming about the pool . There also , beside the water , they found the dead body of Hrothgar 's friend , who had been killed by Grendel 's mother , and they took it up , and mourned over him afresh .
43992	44302	42553	42554	Mr. Norton	89	" But Beowulf took an old and splendid sword that Hrothgar had given him , and he put on his golden helmet and his iron war shirt that no sword could cut through , and when he had bade his friends farewell he leapt straight into the middle of the bog . Down he sank , deeper and deeper into the water , among strange water beasts that struck at him with their tusks as he passed them , till at last Grendel 's mother , the water - wolf , looked up from the bottom and saw him coming . Then she sprang upon him , and seized him , and dragged him down , and he found himself in a sort of hall under the water , with a pale strange light in it . And then he turned from the horrible water - wolf and raised his sword and struck her on the head ; but his blow did her no harm . No sword made by mortal men could harm Grendel or his mother ; and as he struck her Beowulf stumbled and fell . Then the water - wolf rushed forward and sat upon him as he lay there , and raised aloft her own sharp dagger to drive it into his breast ; but Beowulf shook her off , and sprang up , and there , on the wall , he saw hanging a strange old sword that had been made in the old times , long , long ago , when the world was full of giants . So he threw his own sword aside and took down the old sword , and once more he smote the water - wolf . And this time his sword did him good service , and Grendel 's fierce mother sank down dead upon the ground .
44303	44436	44509	44509	he	1161	" Then Beowulf looked round him , and he saw lying in a corner the body of Grendel himself . He cut off the monster 's head , and lo and behold ! when he had cut it off the blade of the old sword melted away , and there was nothing left in his hands but the hilt , with strange letters on it , telling how it was made in old days by the giants for a great king . So with that , and Hrothgar 's sword and Grendel 's head , Beowulf rose up again through the bog , and just as his brave men had begun to think they should never see their dear lord more he came swimming to land , bearing the great head with him .
44437	44496	44509	44509	he	1161	" Then Hrothgar and all his people rejoiced greatly , for they knew that the land would never more be troubled by these hateful monsters , but that the ploughers might plough , and the shepherds might lead their sheep , and brave men might sleep at night , without fear any more of Grendel and his mother . "
44497	44502	44504	44504	Milly	83	" Oh , father ! "
44512	44517	44504	44504	Milly	83	" Is that all ? "
44552	44560	44562	44563	Mr. Norton	89	" That 's all for this time , "
44565	44586	44562	44563	Mr. Norton	89	" Why , Olly , where are your little wits gone to ? Did it frighten you , old man ? "
44587	44590	44592	44592	Olly	63	" Oh ! "
44599	44614	44592	44592	Olly	63	" I did think he would never have comed up out of that bog ! "
44615	44620	44622	44622	Milly	83	" It was splendid , "
44624	44651	44622	44622	Milly	83	" But , father , I do n't understand about that pool . Why did n't Beowulf get drowned when he went down under the water ? "
44652	44663	44665	44666	Mr. Norton	89	" The story does n't tell us anything about that , "
44668	44729	44665	44666	Mr. Norton	89	" But heroes in those days , Milly , must have had something magical about them so that they were able to do things that men and women ca n't do now . Do you know , children , that this story that you have been listening to is more than a thousand years old ? Can you fancy that ? "
44730	44733	44735	44735	Milly	83	" No , "
44741	44768	44738	44738	her	83	" I ca n't fancy it a bit , father . It 's too long . It makes me puzzled to think of so many years . "
44769	44780	44782	44782	Olly	63	" Years and years and years and _ years _ ! "
44784	44794	44782	44782	Olly	63	" When father 's grandfather was a little boy . "
44799	44867	44795	44796	Mr. Norton	89	" Ca n't you think of anything farther back than that , Olly ? It would take a great many grandfathers , and grandfathers ' grandfathers , to get back to the time when the story of Beowulf was made . And here am I telling it to you just in the same way as fathers used to tell it to their children a thousand years ago . "
44868	44886	44888	44888	Milly	83	" I suppose the children liked it so , they would n't let their fathers forget it , "
44890	44928	44888	44888	Milly	83	" And then when they grew up they told it to their children . I shall tell it to my children when I grow up . I think I shall tell it to Katie to - morrow . "
44929	44932	44934	44934	Olly	63	" Father , "
44936	44943	44934	44934	Olly	63	" did Beowulf die -- ever ? "
44944	45254	45256	45257	Mr. Norton	89	" Yes . When he was quite an old man he had another great fight with a dragon , who was guarding a cave full of golden treasure on the sea - shore ; and though he killed the dragon , the dragon gave him a terrible wound , so that when his friends came to look for him they found him lying all but dead in the cave . He was just able to tell them to make a great mound of earth over him when he was dead , on a high rock close by , that sailors might see it from their ships and think of him when they saw it , and then he died . And when he was dead they carried him up to the rock , and there they burned his body , and then they built up a great high mound of earth , and they put Beowulf 's bones inside , and all the treasure from the dragon 's cave . They were ten days building up the mound . Then when it was all done they rode around it weeping and chanting sorrowful songs , and at last they left him there , saying as they went away that never should they see so good a king or so true a master any more . And for hundreds of years afterwards , when the sailors out at sea saw the high mound rising on its point of rock , they said one to another , ' There is Beowulf 's Mount , ' and they began to tell each other of Beowulf 's brave deeds -- how he lived and how he died , and how he fought with Grendel and the wild sea dragons . There , now , I have told you all I know about Beowulf , "
45269	45285	45256	45257	Mr. Norton	89	" and if it is n't somebody else 's turn now it ought to be . "
45286	45293	45295	45295	Olly	63	" Aunt Emma ! Aunt Emma ! "
45378	45385	45387	45387	Milly	83	" Oh you nice blue sky ! "
45401	45456	45387	45387	Milly	83	" Mind you stay there and get bigger . We 'll get on our hats presently and come out to look at you . Oh ! there 's John Backhouse coming down the hill with the dogs . Mother , may we go up ourselves and ask Becky and Tiza to come to tea ? "
45457	45468	45470	45470	Olly	63	" But Aunt Emma must tell us her story first , "
45485	45489	45470	45470	Olly	63	" She promised . "
45490	45495	45497	45498	Aunt Emma	59	" You silly boy ! "
45500	45596	45497	45498	Aunt Emma	59	" as if I was going to keep you indoors listening to stories just now , when the sun 's shining for the first time for three whole days . I promised you my story on a wet day , and you shall have it -- never fear . There 'll be plenty more wet days before you go away from Ravensnest , I 'm afraid . There goes my knitting , and mother 's putting away her work , and father 's stretching himself -- which means we 're all going for a walk . "
45597	45606	45608	45608	Milly	83	" To fetch Becky and Tiza , mother ? "
45614	45621	45612	45612	mother	1502	" Yes , if you like , "
45784	45790	45792	45793	Mr. Norton	89	" Well , old woman , "
45800	45817	45792	45793	Mr. Norton	89	" I do n't suppose you 'd like , a bathe to - day -- quite . "
45818	45826	45828	45828	Olly	63	" If we were in there now , "
45837	45857	45828	45828	Olly	63	" the water would push us down krick ! and the fishes would come and etten us all up . "
45858	45872	45874	45875	his father	262	" They 'd be a long time gobbling you up , Master Fatty , "
45877	45891	45874	45875	his father	262	" Come , run along ; it 's too cold to stand about . "
46052	46057	46059	46060	Aunt Emma	59	" Poor John Backhouse ! "
46062	46086	46059	46060	Aunt Emma	59	" I 'm afraid his hay is a good deal spoilt . Are n't you glad father 's not a farmer , Milly ? "
46087	46093	46095	46095	Milly	83	" Why , Aunt Emma , "
46097	46148	46095	46095	Milly	83	" I 'm always wishing father _ was _ a farmer . I want to be like Becky , and call the cows , and mind the baby all by myself . It must be nice feeding the chickens , and making the hay , and taking the milk around . "
46149	46199	46059	46060	Aunt Emma	59	" Yes , all that 's very nice , but how would you like your hay washed away , and your corn beaten down , and your fruit all spoilt ? Those are things that are constantly happening to John Backhouse , I expect , in the rainy country . "
46200	46211	46213	46213	Milly	83	" Yes , and it wo n't always be summer , "
46217	46248	46213	46213	Milly	83	" I do n't think I should like to stay in that little weeny house all the winter . Is it very cold here in the winter , Aunt Emma ? "
46249	46321	46059	46060	Aunt Emma	59	" Not very , generally . But last winter was very cold here , and the snow lay on the ground for weeks and weeks . On Christmas eve , do you know , Milly , I wanted to have a children 's party in my kitchen , and what do you think I did ? The snow was lying deep on the roads , so I sent out two sledges . "
46322	46327	46329	46329	Olly	63	" What are sledges ? "
46331	46470	46059	46060	Aunt Emma	59	" Carriages with the wheels taken off and two long pieces of wood fastened on instead , so that they slip along smoothly over the snow . And my old coachman drove one and my gardener the other , and they went round all the farmhouses near by , and gathered up the children , little and big , into the sledges , till the coachman had got eight in his sledge , and the gardener had got nine in his , and then they came trotting back with the bells round the horses ' necks jingling and clattering , and two such merry loads of rosy - faced children . I wish you had been there ; I gave them tea in the kitchen , and afterward we had a Christmas tree in the drawing - room . "
46471	46476	46478	46478	Milly	83	" Oh what fun , "
46480	46513	46478	46478	Milly	83	" Why did n't you ask us too , Aunt Emma ? We could have come quite well in the train , you know . But how did the children get home ? "
46514	46560	46059	46060	Aunt Emma	59	" We covered them up warm with rugs and blankets , and sent them back in the sledges . And they looked so happy with their toys and buns cuddled up in their arms , that it did one 's heart good to see them . "
46561	46572	46574	46574	Milly	83	" Mind you ask us next time , Aunt Emma , "
46582	46596	46598	46599	Aunt Emma	59	" Mind you get two pairs of wings by that time , then , "
46601	46641	46598	46599	Aunt Emma	59	" for mother 's not likely to let you come to my Christmas tree unless you promise to fly there and back . But suppose , instead of your coming to me , I come to you next Christmas ? "
46642	46648	46650	46650	Olly	63	" Oh yes ! yes ! "
46661	46693	46650	46650	Olly	63	" come to our Christmas tree , Aunt Emma . We 'll give you ever such nice things -- a ball and a top , and a train -- perhaps -- and-- "
46694	46707	46709	46709	Milly	83	" As if Aunt Emma would care for those kind of things ! "
46711	46752	46709	46709	Milly	83	" No , you shall give her some muffetees , you know , to keep her hands warm , and I 'll make her a needlebook . But , Aunt Emma , do listen ! What can be the matter ? "
46798	46806	46808	46808	Milly	83	" What _ is _ the matter ? "
46846	46849	46851	46851	Milly	83	" Tiza ! "
46919	46930	46932	46933	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Ay , that 's the best place for ye , "
46944	47021	46932	46933	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" you 'll not get into so much mischief there perhaps as you will indoors . Oh , is that you , Miss Elliot ( that was Aunt Emma 's surname ) ? Walk in please , ma'am , though you 'll find me sadly untidy this afternoon . Tiza 's been at her tricks again ; she keeps me sweeping up after her all day . Just look here , if you please , ma'am . "
47113	47116	47118	47119	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Yes , "
47126	47304	47118	47119	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" there 's the supper just spoilt . Tiza 's never easy but when she 's in mischief . I 'm sure these wet days I have'nt known what to do with her indoors all day . And what must she do this afternoon but tie her tin mug to the cat 's tail , till the poor creature was nearly beside herself with fright , and went rushing about upstairs like a mad thing . And then , just when I happened to be out a minute looking after something , she lets the cat in here , and the poor thing jumps into the saucepan I had just put on with the broth for our supper , and in her fright and all turns it right over . And now look at my grate , and the fender , and the floor , and the meat there all messed ! I expect her father'll give Tiza a good beating when he comes in , and I 'm sure I sha n't stand in the way . "
47305	47314	47316	47316	Milly	83	" Oh no , please , Mrs. Backhouse ! "
47329	47354	47316	47316	Milly	83	" Do n't let Mr. Backhouse beat her ; she did n't mean it , she was only in fun , I 'm sure . "
47355	47369	47371	47372	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Well , missy , it 's very troiblesome fun I 'm sure , "
47401	47488	47382	47382	she	101	" I do n't know what I 'm to give John for his supper , that I do n't . I had nothing in the house but just those little odds and ends of meat , that I thought would make a nice bit of broth for supper . And now he 'll come in wet and hungry , and there 'll be nothing for him . Well , we must do with something else , I suppose , but I expect her father'll beat her . "
47647	47650	47652	47652	Milly	83	" Tiza , "
47663	47670	47656	47656	her	83	" do you feel very bad ? "
47674	47687	47689	47689	Milly	83	" We came to take you down to have tea with us , "
47691	47702	47689	47689	Milly	83	" do you think your mother will let you come ? "
47703	47706	47708	47708	Tiza	103	" Naw , "
47737	47740	47741	47741	she	83	" Tiza , "
47745	47758	47741	47741	she	83	" do your father and mother tell you stories when it rains ? "
47759	47762	47764	47764	Tiza	103	" Naw , "
47781	47794	47741	47741	she	83	" Then what do you do , Tiza , when it rains ? "
47795	47798	47800	47800	Tiza	103	" Nothing , "
47802	47828	47800	47800	Tiza	103	" We has our dinners and tea , and sometimes Becky minds the baby and sometimes I do , and father mostly goes to sleep . "
47829	47832	47834	47834	Milly	83	" Tiza , "
47837	47850	47834	47834	Milly	83	" did you _ mean _ pussy to jump into the saucepan ? "
47895	47945	47887	47887	she	103	" Oh , she did jump so , and the mug made such a rattling ! And when she comed out there was just a little bit of carrot sticking to her nose , and her tail was all over cabbage leaf . Oh , she did look funny ! "
47964	47993	47958	47959	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Oh , but , Tiza , Mrs. Backhouse says your father wo n't have anything for his supper . Are n't you sorry you spoilt his supper ? "
47994	47997	47999	47999	Tiza	103	" Yis , "
48003	48020	47999	47999	Tiza	103	" I know father'll beat me , he said he would next time I vexed mother . "
48038	48045	48047	48047	Milly	83	" Do n't cry , Tiza , "
48058	48101	48047	48047	Milly	83	" I 'll beg him not . Ca n't you make up anyway ? Mother says we must always make up if we can when we 've done any harm . I wish I had anything to give you to make up . "
48121	48127	48128	48128	she	103	" You come with me , "
48139	48153	48128	48128	she	103	" Come here by the hedge , do n't let mother see us . "
48243	48247	48248	48248	she	103	" You come , "
48260	48267	48248	48248	she	103	" you come and look here . "
48328	48344	48320	48320	Milly	83	" Oh , Tiza , how be -- utiful ! How did they get there ? "
48345	48388	48390	48390	Tiza	103	" It 's old Sally , our white hen you know , laid them . I found them just after dinner . Mother does n't know nothing about them . I never told Becky , nor nobody . Are n't they beauties ? "
48419	48428	48430	48430	Milly	83	" Oh , and Tiza , I know , "
48433	48475	48430	48430	Milly	83	" you meant these would do for supper . That would be a lovely make up . There 's three . One for Mr. Backhouse , one for Mrs. Backhouse , and one for Becky.--There 's none for you , Tiza . "
48476	48483	48485	48485	Tiza	103	" Nor none for Becky neither , "
48488	48501	48485	48485	Tiza	103	" Father'll want two . Becky and me'll get bread and dripping . "
48502	48516	48430	48430	Milly	83	" Well , come along , Tiza , let 's take them in . "
48517	48524	48526	48526	Tiza	103	" No , you take them , "
48528	48546	48526	48526	Tiza	103	" Mother wo n't want to see me no more , and father'll perhaps be coming in . "
48547	48562	48430	48430	Milly	83	" Oh , but , Tiza , you 'll come to tea with us ? "
48563	48569	48571	48571	Tiza	103	" I do n't know , "
48573	48577	48571	48571	Tiza	103	" You ask . "
48720	48726	48728	48728	Milly	83	" Oh , Mrs. Backhouse , "
48738	48821	48728	48728	Milly	83	" just look here , what I 've brought . Tiza found them just after dinner to - day . They were under the hayrick right away in the corner , and she wanted to make up , so she showed me where they were , so I brought them in , and there 's two for Mr. Backhouse , and one for you , you know . And , please , wo n't you let Tiza come to tea with us ? "
48846	48907	48990	48991	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Ay , that 's Sally , I suppose . She 's always hiding her eggs is Sally , where I ca n't find them . So it was Tiza found them , was it , Missy ? Well , they will come , in very handy for supper as it happens . Thank you kindly for bringing them in . "
48945	48956	48926	48926	Becky	102	" Thank you for helping Tiza out of her scrape . "
48957	48969	48971	48971	Milly	83	" And you 'll let Becky and Tiza come to tea ? "
48974	48988	48990	48991	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Well , I 'm sure , Miss , I do n't know , "
48996	49015	48990	48991	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Becky may come and welcome , but perhaps it would do Tiza good to stay at home . "
49016	49029	49031	49032	Aunt Emma	59	" Do n't you think she 'd better have a little change ? "
49046	49095	49031	49032	Aunt Emma	59	" I daresay staying indoors so long made her restless . If you will let me carry them both off , I daresay between us , Mrs. Backhouse , we can give Tiza a talking to , and perhaps she 'll come back in a more sensible mood . "
49096	49126	49134	49135	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Well , Miss Elliot , she shall go if you wish it . Come Becky , give me the baby , and go and put your things on . "
49137	49140	49134	49135	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Tiza ! "
49197	49211	49213	49214	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" There , go along , Tiza , and get your things on , "
49222	49291	49213	49214	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" I would n't have let you go out to tea , you know , if Miss Elliot and Missy had n't asked particular . Mind you do n't get into no more mischief . And very like those eggs'll do for father 's supper ; so , I daresay , I 'll not say anything to him this time -- just for once . Now go up . "
49341	49346	49348	49349	Mr. Norton	89	" Well , Tiza , "
49391	49391	49384	49384	you	103	"
49392	49396	49398	49398	Tiza	103	" Beat him , "
49411	49417	49419	49420	Mr. Norton	89	" Oh dear , no ! "
49422	49439	49419	49420	Mr. Norton	89	" that would n't do my dinner any good . I should eat him up instead . "
49440	49452	49454	49454	Olly	63	" I do n't believe little boys taste good a bit , "
49467	49480	49454	49454	Olly	63	" If you ettened me , father , you 'd be ill . "
49481	49485	49487	49488	Mr. Norton	89	" Oh no , "
49490	49529	49487	49488	Mr. Norton	89	" not if I eat you with plenty of bread - sauce . That 's the best way to cook little boys . Now , Milly , which of you three girls can get to that gate first ? "
49602	49607	49609	49609	Milly	83	" Oh , Becky ! "
49626	49645	49612	49612	her	83	" I hope you may stay a good long time . What time do you go to bed ? "
49646	49654	49656	49656	Becky	102	" Oh , I do n't know , "
49658	49665	49656	49656	Becky	102	" We go when fayther goes . "
49666	49671	49673	49673	Milly	83	" When fayther goes ! "
49675	49694	49673	49673	Milly	83	" Why , we go ever so long before father . Why do you stay up so late ? "
49695	49703	49705	49705	Becky	102	" Why , it is n't late , "
49707	49754	49705	49705	Becky	102	" Fayther goes to bed , now it 's summertime , about half - past eight ; but in winter , of course , he goes earlier . And we all goes together , except baby . Mother puts him out of the way before supper . "
49755	49762	49764	49764	Milly	83	" Well , but how funny , "
49766	49780	49764	49764	Milly	83	" I ca n't think why you should be so different from us . "
50191	50193	50224	50224	Tiza	103	" Haymaking "
50554	50557	50559	50559	Milly	83	" Father , "
50597	50608	51107	51108	Mrs. Norton	70	" does everybody have birthdays ? Do policemen have birthdays ? "
50609	50616	50618	50619	Mr. Norton	89	" I expect so , Milly , "
50623	50634	50618	50619	Mr. Norton	89	" but they have n't any time to remember them . "
50635	50717	51107	51108	Mrs. Norton	70	" But , father , what 's the good of having birthdays if you do n't keep them , and have presents and all that ? And do cats and dogs have birthdays ? I should like to find out Spot 's birthday . We 'd give her cream instead of milk , you know , and I 'd tie a blue ribbon round her neck , and one round her tail like the queen 's sheep in mother 's story . "
50718	50730	50732	50733	Mr. Norton	89	" I do n't suppose Spot would thank you at all , "
50735	50756	50732	50733	Mr. Norton	89	" The cream would make her ill , and the ribbon would fidget her dreadfully till she pulled it off . "
50757	50761	50763	50763	Milly	83	" Oh dear ! "
50765	50829	50763	50763	Milly	83	" Well , I suppose Spot had better not have any birthday then . But , father , what do you think ? Becky and Tiza do n't care about their birthdays a bit . Becky could hardly remember when hers was , and they never have any presents unless Aunt Emma gives them one , or people to tea , or anything . '
50830	50917	51107	51108	Mrs. Norton	70	" Well , you see , Milly , when people have only just pennies and shillings enough to buy bread and meat to eat , and clothes to put on , they ca n't go spending money on presents ; and when they 're very anxious and busy all the year round they ca n't be remembering birthdays and taking pains about them like richer people can , who have less to trouble them , and whose work does not take up quite so much time . "
50918	50957	50763	50763	Milly	83	" Well , but why do n't the rich people remember the poor people 's birthdays for them , father ? Then they could give them presents , and ask them to tea and all , you know . "
50958	50969	50971	50972	Mr. Norton	89	" Yes , that would be a very good arrangement , "
50981	50999	50971	50972	Mr. Norton	89	" Only , somehow , Milly , things do n't come right like that in this world . "
51000	51017	51019	51019	Milly	83	" Well , I 'm going to try and remember Becky 's and Tiza 's birthdays , "
51021	51097	51019	51019	Milly	83	" I 'll tell mother to put them down in her pocket - book -- won't you , mother ? Oh , what fun ! I 'll send them birthday cards , and they 'll be so surprised , and wonder why ; and then they 'll say , ' Oh , why , of course it 's our birthday!'--No , not _ our _ birthday -- but you know what I mean , father . "
51098	51105	51107	51108	Mrs. Norton	70	" Well , but , Milly , "
51110	51125	51107	51108	Mrs. Norton	70	" have you made up your mind what you want to do this birthday ? "
51161	51181	51126	51126	Milly	83	" Well , monkey , out with it . What have you got hidden away in your little head ? "
51182	51187	51189	51189	Milly	83	" Well , mother , "
51193	51221	51189	51189	Milly	83	" I do n't want to _ have _ anybody to tea . I want to go out to tea with somebody . Now can you guess ? "
51222	51227	51126	51126	Milly	83	" With Aunt Emma ? "
51228	51246	51189	51189	Milly	83	" Oh no , Aunt Emma 's coming over here all day . She promised she would . "
51247	51253	51126	51126	Milly	83	" With Becky and Tiza ? "
51267	51285	51189	51189	Milly	83	" But I do n't expect Mrs. Backhouse will want the trouble of having you two to tea .
51286	51354	51189	51189	Milly	83	" Oh mother , she wo n't mind a bit . I know she wo n't ; because Becky told me one day her mother would like us very much to come some time if you 'd let us . And Nana could come and help Mrs. Backhouse , and we could all wash up the tea - things afterwards , like we did at the picnic . "
51355	51364	51366	51366	Olly	63	" Then Tiza must n't sit next me , "
51379	51404	51366	51366	Olly	63	" She takes away my bread and butter when I 'm not looking , and I do n't like it , not a bit . "
51405	51415	51417	51417	Milly	83	" No , Olly dear , she sha n't , "
51436	51451	51428	51428	she	83	" I 'll sit on one side of you and Becky on the other , "
51468	51478	51480	51481	Mrs. Norton	70	" Well , you must ask Mrs. Backhouse yourselves , "
51483	51510	51480	51481	Mrs. Norton	70	" And if it is her washing - day , or inconvenient to her at all , you must n't think of going , you know . "
51633	51636	51637	51637	he	63	" Milly , "
51642	51682	51637	51637	he	63	" _ would n't _ you like to know about your presents ? But of course I sha n't tell you about mine . Perhaps I 'm not going to give you one at all . Oh , mother , "
51691	51704	51688	51689	Mrs. Norton	70	" did you put it away safe where she ca n't see ? "
51705	51712	51714	51714	Milly	83	" Oh , you silly boy , "
51716	51728	51714	51714	Milly	83	" you 'll tell me if you do n't take care . "
51729	51774	51688	51689	Mrs. Norton	70	" No , I sha n't . I would n't tell you if you were to go on asking me all day . It is n't very big , you know , Milly , and -- and -- it is n't pretty outside -- only-- "
51775	51781	51783	51784	Mr. Norton	89	" Be quiet , chatterbox , "
51793	51812	51783	51784	Mr. Norton	89	" you 'll tell in another minute , and then there 'll be no fun to - morrow . "
51846	51849	51850	51850	he	63	" Father , "
51855	51879	51850	51850	he	63	" do take Milly out for a walk , and mother shall take me . Then I ca n't tell , you know . "
51969	51974	51976	51976	nurse	1496	" Bless their hearts , "
51981	52001	51976	51976	nurse	1496	" they can think of nothing but to - morrow . They 'll be sadly disappointed if it rains . "
52074	52078	52080	52080	Milly	83	" Oh dear ! "
52090	52113	52085	52085	her	83	" it 's my birthday , and it 's fine . Nana , bring me my things , please.--But where 's Olly ? "
52149	52183	52185	52185	nurse	1496	" Why , Miss Milly , are you woke up at last ? I hardly thought you 'd have slept so late this morning . Many happy returns of the day to you , "
52193	52217	52185	52185	nurse	1496	" Thank you , _ dear _ nurse . Oh , it is so nice having birthdays . But where can Olly be ? "
52218	52228	52230	52230	nurse	1496	" Do n't you trouble your head about him , "
52259	52284	52254	52254	mother	1502	" Well , birthday - girl ! The top of the morning to you , and many , many happy returns of the day . "
52336	52363	52304	52304	mother	1502	" Now , Milly , wait one minute till you hear the bell ring , and then you may come down as fast as you like . "
52389	52397	52399	52399	Milly	83	" Oh , that 's Olly ringing , "
52630	52635	52602	52602	mother	1502	" Miss Milly Norton , "
52682	52704	52706	52706	Olly	63	" We got all those roses , mother and me , this morning , when you was fast asleep , Milly , "
52717	52756	52706	52706	Olly	63	" Mother pulled me out of bed ever so early , and I putted on my goloshes , and did n't we get wet just ! Milly , _ is n't _ my paint - box a beauty ? "
52800	52803	52805	52805	father	1498	" Now , "
52810	52831	52805	52805	father	1498	" I 'm yours , Milly , for all this morning . What are you going to do with me ? "
52832	52845	52847	52847	Olly	63	" Make you into a tiger , father , and shoot you , "
52864	52873	52875	52876	Mr. Norton	89	" I did n't ask you , sir , "
52878	52898	52875	52876	Mr. Norton	89	" I 'm not yours , I 'm Milly 's . Now , Milly , what shall we do ? "
52899	52925	52988	52988	she	59	" Will you take us right to the top of Brownholme , father ? You know we have n't been to the very top yet . "
52926	52961	52875	52876	Mr. Norton	89	" Very well , we 'll go if your legs will carry you . But you must ask them very particularly first how they feel , for it 'll be stiff work for them . "
53078	53112	53062	53062	she	1502	" I do n't want to have everything just as _ I _ like , to - day , mother . Ca n't I do what somebody else likes ? I 'd rather . "
53247	53252	53254	53255	Mrs. Norton	70	" Dear little woman , "
53268	53353	53254	53255	Mrs. Norton	70	" go and be happy . That 's what we all like to - day . Besides , you 'll find plenty of ways of doing what other people like before the end of the day without my inventing any . Run along now , and climb away . Mind you do n't let Olly tumble into bogs , and mind you bring me a bunch of ferns for the dinner - table -- and there 'll be two things done at any rate . "
53399	53402	53404	53404	he	66	" intake , "
54509	54543	54493	54493	he	63	" _ This _ currant says to _ that _ currant , ' I 'm here , where are you ? You 're so far off I ca n't see you nowhere . ' "
54544	54550	54552	54552	Milly	83	" Olly , be quiet , "
54554	54644	54493	54493	he	63	" Well , but , Milly , I ca n't help it ; it 's so funny . There 's only three currants in my bit , and cookie puts such a lot in at home . I 'm pretending they 're little children wanting to play , only they ca n't , they 're so far off . There , I 've etten one up . Now there 's only two . That 's you and me , Milly . I 'll eat you up first -- krick ! "
54645	54655	54657	54658	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" Never mind about the currants , little master , "
54664	54695	54657	54658	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" It 's nice and sweet any way , and you can eat as much of it as you like , which is more than you can of rich cakes . "
54774	54789	54790	54790	he	63	" We 're going to carry all the hay in yon lower field presently , "
54799	54809	54790	54790	he	63	" Send the young ' uns down to see . "
55045	55051	55038	55038	Milly	83	" Babes in the Wood , "
55304	55311	55313	55314	Aunt Emma	59	" What a happy little party , "
55322	55331	55313	55314	Aunt Emma	59	" there 's nothing like hay for children . "
55378	55383	55385	55385	John	66	" Gee - up , "
55405	55408	55387	55387	his	66	" Hurrah ! "
55531	55538	55540	55540	Milly	83	" Oh , mother ! mother ! "
55547	55560	55540	55540	Milly	83	" tell me , mother , what is the matter with Becky ? "
55598	55609	55611	55612	Mrs. Norton	70	" She was under the cart when it moved on , "
55620	55658	55611	55612	Mrs. Norton	70	" We none of us know how it happened . She must have been trying to hand up some hay at the last moment and tumbled under . I do n't think her head is much hurt . "
55671	55683	55685	55686	Mr. Norton	89	" Better let me carry her up now without moving her , "
55700	55717	55689	55690	Mrs. Backhouse	101	" She has fainted , I think . We must get some water at the stream . "
55752	55827	55734	55735	Aunt Emma	59	" We hope she is not much hurt , darlings ; the wheel did not go over her , thank God . It was just upon her when her father backed the horse . But it must have crushed her I 'm afraid , and there was something hanging under the cart which gave her that knock on the temple . Look , there is one of the men starting off for the doctor . "
55854	55857	55859	55860	Aunt Emma	59	" Nurse , "
55862	55884	55859	55860	Aunt Emma	59	" stay here with these two poor little ones while I go and see if I can be of any use . "
56019	56028	56029	56029	she	187	" Oh , Miss Emma , Miss Emma , "
56037	56047	56029	56029	she	187	" I 'm afeard but she 's badly hurt . "
56048	56058	56060	56061	Aunt Emma	59	" I hope not , with all my heart , "
56068	56086	56060	56061	Aunt Emma	59	" But the doctor will soon be here ; we must get her home before he comes . "
56250	56256	56258	56258	Milly	83	" Oh , Aunt Emma , "
56266	56271	56258	56258	Milly	83	" is she better ? "
56272	56347	56236	56236	nurse	1496	" A little , I think , Milly , but the doctor will soon be here , and then we shall know all about it . Tiza , you poor little woman , Mrs. Wheeler says you must sleep with them to - night . Your mother will want the house very quiet , and to - morrow , you know , you can go and see Becky if the doctor says you may . "
56497	56501	56503	56503	Milly	83	" Aunt Emma , "
56533	56542	56523	56524	Mr. Norton	89	" how did Becky tumble under the cart ? "
56543	56598	56503	56503	Milly	83	" She was lifting up some hay , I think , which had fallen off , and one of the men was stooping down to take it on his fork , and then she must have slipped and fallen right under the cart , just as John Backhouse told the horse to go on . "
56599	56611	56613	56613	Milly	83	" Oh , if the wheel _ had _ gone over ! "
56617	56655	56613	56613	Milly	83	" Is n't it a sad birthday , Aunt Emma , and we were so happy a little while ago ? And then I ca n't understand . I do n't know why it happens like this . "
56656	56662	56503	56503	Milly	83	" Like what , Milly ? "
56663	56723	56613	56613	Milly	83	" Why , Aunt Emma , always in stories , you know , it 's the bad people get hurt and die . And now it 's poor little Becky that 's hurt . And she 's such a dear little girl , and helps her mother so . I do n't think she ought to have been hurt . "
56724	56849	56503	56503	Milly	83	" We do n't know anything about ' oughts , ' Milly , darling , you and I. God knows , we trust , and that helps many people who love God to be patient when they are in trouble or pain . But think if it had been poor mischievous little Tiza who had been hurt , how she would have fretted . And now very likely Becky will bear it beautifully , and so , without knowing it , she will be teaching Tiza to be patient , and it will do Tiza good to have to help Becky and take care of her for a bit , instead of letting Becky always look after her and get her out of scrapes . "
56850	56873	56875	56875	Milly	83	" Oh , and Aunt Emma , ca n't we all take care of Becky ? What can Olly and I do ? "
56879	56891	56893	56893	Olly	63	" I can go and sing all my songs to Becky , "
56899	56908	56910	56911	Aunt Emma	59	" By - and - by , perhaps , "
56919	56930	56910	56911	Aunt Emma	59	" But hark ! is n't that father 's step ? "
56948	56955	56957	56957	Milly	83	" Oh yes , it is , "
56959	56966	56957	56957	Milly	83	" It 's father and mother . "
56991	57068	56975	56976	Mrs. Norton	70	" She 's not _ very _ badly hurt , darling . The doctor says she must lie quite quiet for two or three weeks , and then he hopes she 'll be all right . The wheel gave her a squeeze , which jarred her poor little back and head very much , but it did n't break anything , and if she lies very quite the doctor thinks she 'll get quite well again . "
57069	57078	56975	56976	Mrs. Norton	70	" Oh mother ! and does Tiza know ? "
57079	57144	56975	56976	Mrs. Norton	70	" Yes , we have just been to tell her . Mrs. Wheeler had put her to bed , but she went up to give her our message , and she said poor little Tiza began to cry again , and wanted us to tell her mother she would be _ so _ quiet if only they would let her come back to Becky . "
57145	57151	56975	56976	Mrs. Norton	70	" Will they , mother ? "
57152	57175	56975	56976	Mrs. Norton	70	" In a few days , perhaps . But she is not to see anybody but Mrs. Backhouse for a little while . "
57176	57180	57182	57182	Milly	83	" Oh dear ! "
57193	57233	57182	57182	Milly	83	" We shall be going away so soon , and we ca n't say good - bye . Is n't it sad , mother , just happening last thing ? and we 've been so happy all the time . "
57234	57239	57241	57242	Mr. Norton	89	" Yes , Milly , "
57251	57297	57241	57242	Mr. Norton	89	" This is the first really sad thing that ever happened to you in your little life I think . Mother , and I , and Aunt Emma , tell you stories about sad things , but that 's very different , is n't it ? "
57298	57301	57303	57303	Milly	83	" Yes , "
57307	57327	57303	57303	Milly	83	" Father , are there as many sad things really as there are in stories?--you know what I mean . "
57328	57396	57241	57242	Mr. Norton	89	" There are a great many sad things and sad people in the world , Milly . We do n't have monsters plaguing us like King Hrothgar , but every day there is trouble and grief going on somewhere , and we happy and strong people must care for the sad ones if we want to do our duty and help to straighten the world a little . "
57397	57400	57402	57402	Milly	83	" Father , "
57406	57424	57402	57402	Milly	83	" will you tell us how -- Olly and me ? We would if we knew how . "
57425	57468	57241	57242	Mr. Norton	89	" Well , Milly , suppose you begin with Becky , and poor Tiza too , indeed . I wonder whether a pair of little people could make a scrap - book for Becky to look at when she is getting better ? "
57469	57475	57477	57477	Milly	83	" Oh yes , yes ! "
57481	57519	57477	57477	Milly	83	" I 've got ever so many pictures in mother 's writing - book , she let me cut out of her ' Graphics , ' and Olly can help paste ; ca n't you , Olly ? "
57520	57531	57533	57534	Mr. Norton	89	" Olly generally pastes his face more than anything else , "
57545	57567	57533	57534	Mr. Norton	89	" If I 'm not very much mistaken , there is a little fairy pasting up your eyes , old man . "
57568	57578	57580	57580	Olly	63	" I 'm not sleepy , not a bit , "
57590	57602	57604	57605	Mr. Norton	89	" I think you 're not sleepy , but just asleep , "
57655	57658	57669	57669	Becky	102	" sad things "
57901	57910	57912	57912	Tiza	103	" They do n't have porridge for breakfast , "
57926	57966	57915	57915	her	103	" Mother always gives us porridge . And I wo n't sit next Charlie . He 's always dirtying hisself . He stickied hisself just all over this morning with treacle . Mother would have given him a clout . "
58100	58103	58105	58105	Tiza	103	" Becky , "
58119	58138	58105	58105	Tiza	103	" here 's some strawberries . Wheeler gave me some . You can have some if you want . "
58139	58143	58145	58145	Becky	102	" Just one , "
58171	58182	58184	58184	Becky	102	" You 'll have to nurse baby now , Tiza , "
58187	58220	58184	58184	Becky	102	" he 's been under mother 's feet terrible . Mind you do n't let him eat nasty things . He 'll get at the coals if you do n't mind him . "
58221	58228	58230	58230	Tiza	103	" I 'll not let him , "
58488	58500	58502	58502	Milly	83	" ' Have n't you got a bump ? ' asked Olly "
58523	58529	58531	58531	Milly	83	" Is your back better ? "
58535	58546	58531	58531	Milly	83	" I 'm so glad the doctor let us come . "
58547	58555	58557	58557	Olly	63	" Have n't you got a bump ? "
58567	58590	58557	58557	Olly	63	" We thought you 'd have a great black bump on your fore - head , you know -- ever so big . "
58591	58599	58601	58601	Becky	102	" No , it 's a cut , "
58603	58616	58601	58601	Becky	102	" there now , you can see how it 's plastered up . "
58617	58622	58624	58624	Olly	63	" Did it hurt ? "
58626	58645	58624	58624	Olly	63	" did you kick ? I should have kicked . And does the doctor give you nasty medicine ? "
58646	58649	58651	58651	Becky	102	" No , "
58653	58691	58651	58651	Becky	102	" I do n't have any now . And it was n't nasty at all what I had first . And now I may have strawberries and raspberries , and Mr. Wheeler sends mother a plate everyday . "
58692	58709	58711	58711	Olly	63	" I do n't think it 's fair that little boys should n't never be ill , "
58732	58739	58741	58741	Milly	83	" Oh , you funny boy , "
58743	58770	58741	58741	Milly	83	" why , mother gives you some every day though you are n't ill ; and I 'm sure you would n't like staying in bed . "
58771	58777	58779	58779	Olly	63	" Yes , I should , "
58788	58817	58779	58779	Olly	63	" Do you know , Becky , we 've got a secret , and we 're not to tell it you , only Milly and I are going to-- "
58818	58822	58824	58824	Milly	83	" Do n't ! "
58834	58848	58824	58824	Milly	83	" You 'll tell in a minute . You 're always telling secrets . "
58849	58925	58779	58779	Olly	63	" Well , just half , Milly , I wo n't tell it all you know . It 's just like something burning inside my mouth . We 're going to make you something , Becky , when we get home . Something be -- ootiful , you know . And you can look at it in bed , and we wo n't make it big , so you can turn over the pages , and-- "
58926	58932	58934	58934	Milly	83	" Be quiet , Olly , "
58936	58968	58934	58934	Milly	83	" I should think Becky'll guess now . It 'll come by post , Becky . Mother 's going to help us make it . You 'll like it I know . "
58969	58979	58981	58981	Olly	63	" It's -- it's -- a picture - book ! "
58995	59004	58981	58981	Olly	63	" You wo n't tell , will you ? "
59005	59012	59014	59014	Milly	83	" Oh , you unkind boy , "
59018	59029	59014	59014	Milly	83	" I 'll never have a secret with you again . "
59079	59090	59092	59092	Milly	83	" I 'm going to write to you , Becky , "
59102	59126	59092	59092	Milly	83	" and at Christmas I 'll send you a Christmas card , and perhaps some day we 'll come here again you know . "
59127	59136	59138	59138	Olly	63	" And then we 'll milk the cows , "
59140	59187	59138	59138	Olly	63	" wo n't we , Becky ? And I 'll ride on your big horse . Mr. Backhouse says I may ride all alone some day when I 'm big ; when I 'm sixty -- no , when I 'm ninety - five you know . "
59280	59287	59292	59292	she	83	" Oh , you dear mountains , "
59299	59308	59292	59292	she	83	" Look Nana , are n't they lovely ? "
59363	59403	59357	59357	Milly	83	" Good - bye river , good - bye stepping - stones , good - bye doves , good - bye fly - catchers ! Mind you do n't any of you go away till we come back again . "
59471	59478	59481	59482	the children	198	" Mind you come at Christmas , "
59521	59524	59526	59526	Milly	83	" Mother , "
59555	59621	59543	59543	Brownholme	24	" I think Ravensnest is the nicest place we ever stopped at . And I do n't think the rain matters either . I 'm going to tell your old gentleman so . He said it rained in the mountains , and it does , mother -- doesn't it ? but he said the rain spoilt everything , and it doesn't -- not a bit . "
59622	59641	59533	59534	Aunt Emma	59	" Why , there 's that curious old fairy been sprinkling dust in your eyes too , Milly ! "
