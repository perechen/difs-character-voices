1077	1125	948	948	Batts	115	" Well , I ai n't heared much about her -- not yet awhile . But they say as she 's nice - lookin ' , an ' Muster Shentsone ee said as she 'd been to college somewhere , where they 'd larn't her farmin ' . "
1133	1136	1137	1137	he	297	" College ! "
1156	1167	1137	1137	he	297	" _ They _ ca n't larn yer farmin ' ! "

1207	1217	1219	1220	the other	283	" She 'd better be full o ' money , "
1224	1234	1219	1220	the other	283	" Notions is no good without money to 'em . "
1235	1271	948	948	Batts	115	" Aye , they 're wunnerfull costly things is notions . Yo'd better by a long way go by the folk as know . But they do say she 'll be payin ' good wages . "
1272	1294	1296	1296	Batts	115	" I dessay she will ! She 'll be obleeged . It 's Hobson 's choice , as you might say ! "
1578	1604	1606	1607	old Halsey	114	" There she be ! I did hear as Webb wor to meet her at the station . He 's took her over once before , "

3194	3214	3216	3216	Hastings	127	" I 'm afraid I have n't as much to show you , miss , as I 'd like , "
3225	3279	3280	3280	He	292	" It 's cruel work nowadays trying to do anything of this kind . Two of the men that began work last week have been called up , and there 's another been just ' ticed away from me this week . The wages that some people about will give are just mad ! "
3286	3295	3283	3283	his	292	" Colonel Shepherd says he ca n't compete . "
3535	3542	3543	3543	she	127	" It is a poor place ! "
3547	3562	3543	3543	she	127	" and those men do n't seem to have done much to it yet . "
3592	3597	3598	3598	she	127	" I never noticed , "
3601	3619	3598	3598	she	127	" that the living room goes right through . What draughts there 'll be in the winter ! "
4414	4416	4413	4413	Her	127	" nice "
4577	4581	4583	4584	Miss Henderson	127	" All right ! "
4596	4638	4589	4589	her	127	" now I think we 've been through everything . I 'll take over one cart , and Mrs. Wellin must remove the other . I 'll buy the chaff - cutter and the dairy things , but not the reaping machine-- "
4639	4651	4654	4654	Hastings	127	" I 'm afraid that 'll put Mrs. Wellin out considerably ! "
4656	4695	4589	4589	her	127	" Ca n't help it . I ca n't have the place cluttered up with old iron like that . It 's worth nothing . I 'm sure _ you _ would n't advise me to buy it ! "
4753	4794	4745	4746	Miss Henderson	127	" And you 'll hurry these men up?--as much as you can ? They _ are _ slow - coaches ! I must get in the week after next . Miss Leighton and I intend to come , whatever happens . "
4798	4801	4795	4795	Hastings	127	" Miss Leighton "
4831	4903	4821	4822	Miss Henderson	127	" And you must please engage those two men you spoke of . Neither of them , you say , under sixty ! Well , there 's no picking and choosing now . If they were eighty I should have to take them ! till the harvest 's got in . There are two girls coming from the Land Army , and you 've clinched that other girl from the village ? "
4907	4921	4922	4922	she	127	" Well , I dare say we shall get the harvest in somehow , "
4936	4960	4922	4922	she	127	" Miss Leighton and I mean to put our backs into it . But Miss Leighton is n't as strong as I am . "
4985	5003	4981	4981	she	127	" I expect you think it a queer business , Mr. Hastings , women taking to farming ? "
5004	5017	5086	5086	She	127	" Well , it 's new , you see , Miss Henderson . "
5018	5037	5038	5038	She	127	" I believe it 's going to be very common . Why should n't the women do it ! "
5043	5051	5053	5053	Hastings	127	" Oh , no reason at all , "
5062	5085	5057	5057	he	482	" I 've nothing against it myself . And there wo n't be men enough to go round , after the war . "
5092	5102	5086	5086	She	127	" You 've got a son in the war ? "
5103	5112	5086	5086	She	127	" Two , and one 's been killed . "
5113	5117	5086	5086	She	127	" Last year ? "
5118	5124	5086	5086	She	127	" No , last month . "
5138	5148	5149	5149	Hastings	127	" He was to have been allowed home directly , "
5153	5173	5174	5174	He	482	" for two or three months . He was head woodman before the war on Lord Radley 's property . "
5184	5202	5174	5174	He	482	" And they were to have given him leave to see to the cutting of these woods . "
5203	5207	5208	5209	Miss Henderson	127	" These woods ! "
5217	5229	5208	5209	Miss Henderson	127	" You do n't mean to say they 're coming down ! "
5230	5236	5238	5238	Hastings	127	" Half of them commandeered , "
5244	5295	5238	5238	Hastings	127	" The Government valuers have been all over them these last weeks . They 're splendid timber , you know . There 's been a timber camp the other side of the hills a long while . They 've got Canadians , and no doubt they 'll move on here . "
5341	5351	5352	5352	he	487	" Well , the Government must have the wood , "
5358	5374	5352	5352	he	487	" We 've got to win the war . But it does seem a pity . "
5375	5388	5389	5389	she	127	" I do n't know that I should have taken the farm , "
5395	5421	5393	5393	her	127	" If you had known ? I wish I 'd thought to tell you . But it was really only settled a few days ago . "
5422	5437	5438	5438	she	127	" I do n't like having a lot of strange men about the farm , "
5442	5452	5438	5438	she	127	" especially when I have girls to look after . "
5453	5466	5467	5467	he	487	" Oh , the camp 's a long way from the farm , "
5471	5479	5467	5467	he	487	" And these woods will come last . "
5498	5527	5528	5528	He	487	" Do n't let me keep you , Mr. Hastings . I 'll lock up the house , if you 'll tell me where to leave the key . "
5684	5688	5674	5674	She	127	" good sort . "
6021	6027	6028	6028	she	129	" That 's done with ! "
6060	6063	6056	6056	she	129	" done with "
6096	6114	6116	6117	Miss Henderson	127	" You do seem to have hit on a rather nice spot , Rachel , though lonesome , "
6607	6615	6617	6618	Janet Leighton	131	" Why , there 's the vicar ! "
6659	6668	6669	6669	she	129	" Oh , dear , what a bore , "
6673	6695	6669	6669	she	129	" I suppose I must go and tidy up . Nobody ought to be allowed to pay visits after five o'clock . "
6696	6712	6650	6650	Rachel	129	" You asked him something about a village woman to help , did n't you ? "
6713	6720	6722	6722	Rachel	129	" I did , worse luck ! "
6885	6903	6880	6880	Janet	131	" How little I really know about her . She is a darling -- but a mystery ! "
7131	7179	7125	7125	His	3228	" I have come at an unearthly hour , Miss Leighton . But I thought I should have no chance of finding Miss Henderson free till the evening , and I came to tell you that I think I have found a woman to do your work . "
7214	7223	7224	7224	he	3228	" How nice you have made it all , "
7231	7299	7224	7224	he	3228	" When I think what a deserted hole this has been for years . You know , the village people firmly believe it is haunted ? Old Wellin never could get anybody to sleep here . But tramps often used it , I 'm certain . They got in through the windows . Hastings told me he had several times found a smouldering fire in the kitchen . "
7300	7307	7308	7308	Janet	131	" What sort is the ghost ? "
7327	7344	7312	7312	she	131	" Well , there 's a story -- but I wonder whether I ought to tell you-- "
7345	7358	7360	7360	Janet	131	" I assure you as to ghosts -- I have no nerves ! "
7366	7402	7360	7360	Janet	131	" and I do n't think Rachel has either . We are more frightened of rats . This farm - yard contains the biggest I 've ever seen . I dream of them at night . "
7403	7410	7412	7413	the vicar	3228	" It 's not exactly the ghost-- "
7417	7431	7312	7312	she	131	" But the story that produced the ghost ? What -- a murder ? "
7432	7438	7440	7441	the vicar	3228	" Half a century ago , "
7444	7451	7440	7441	the vicar	3228	" you wo n't mind that ? "
7452	7512	7312	7312	she	131	" Not the least . A century ago would be romantic . If it was just the other day , we should feel we ought to have got the farm cheaper . But half a century does n't matter . It 's a mid - Victorian , just a plain , old - fashioned murder . Who did it ? "
7731	7760	7723	7724	the vicar	3228	" I ought n't to have told you -- I really ought n't ; just on your settling in -- I hope you wo n't tell Miss Henderson ? "
8166	8172	8174	8174	Rachel	129	" She comes from Ralstone , "
8176	8200	8174	8174	Rachel	129	" Ah , that 's the village where the new timber camp is . You really must see that camp , Miss Henderson . "
8201	8212	8213	8213	she	129	" I hate to think of the woods coming down , "
8220	8276	8213	8213	she	129	" We all do . But that 's the war . It ca n't be helped , alack ! But it 's wonderful to see the women at work , measuring and checking , doing the brain work , in fact , while the men do the felling and loading . It makes one envious . "
8292	8301	8336	8336	he	3228	" Of the men -- or the women ? "
8302	8334	8336	8336	he	3228	" Oh , their work , I mean . They 're doing something for the war . I 've done my best . But the Bishop wo n't hear of it . "
8362	8373	8374	8374	he	3228	" I suppose there must be some left at home , "
8380	8392	8374	8374	he	3228	" and the doctors seem to have a down on me . "
8476	8486	8454	8454	she	133	" Were you ever in Canada , Miss Henderson ? "
8521	8530	8514	8515	Rachel Henderson	129	" Yes , I have been in Canada . "
8531	8545	8514	8515	Rachel Henderson	129	" You have ? Oh , then , you know all about it . "
8546	8554	8514	8515	Rachel Henderson	129	" I know nothing about Canadian lumbering . "
8555	8562	8514	8515	Rachel Henderson	129	" You were on the prairies ? "
8563	8573	8514	8515	Rachel Henderson	129	" I lived some time on a prairie farm . "
8574	8584	8586	8587	the vicar	3228	" Everything here must seem very small to you , "
8618	8636	8637	8637	he	3228	" I trust you will call upon me for any help I can possibly be to you , "
8645	8672	8673	8673	He	3228	" I should be delighted to help in the harvest if you want it . I have a pair of hands anyway , as you see ! "
8722	8730	8732	8734	the young man	598	" Good - night , Miss Henderson , "
8751	8789	8732	8734	the young man	598	" I hope you will let your Ralstone girl come sometimes to the clubroom my sister and I have in the village ? We feel young people ought to be amused , especially when they work hard . "
8790	8811	8732	8734	the young man	598	" Thank you , but it 's so far away . We do n't like them to be out late . "
8812	8826	8827	8828	The vicar	3228	" Certainly not . But in the long evenings -- don't you know ? "
8832	8877	8827	8828	The vicar	3228	" However , there it is -- whenever she comes she will be welcome . And then , as to your seat in church . There is a pew that has always belonged to the farm . It is about half - way up . "
8878	8886	8888	8888	Rachel	129	" We do n't go to church , "
8893	8901	8902	8902	She	129	" At least , I do n't . "
8908	8917	8919	8919	Janet	131	" And I ca n't be counted on , "
8929	8938	8923	8924	The vicar	3228	" Then you 're not Church of England ? "
8939	8943	8945	8945	Rachel	129	" I am , "
8948	8963	8945	8945	Rachel	129	" at least I 'm not anything else . Miss Leighton is a Unitarian . "
8983	8997	8980	8980	she	129	" I 'm afraid you 'll think us dreadful heathens , Mr. Shenstone ! "

10238	10295	10298	10298	she	129	" she supposed , had brought the child . She had noticed a little girl playing about the reapers in the afternoon -- no doubt an elder sister brought to look after the baby . Between the mother and the sister there must have been some confusion , and one or other would come running back directly .

11409	11459	11401	11402	Janet Leighton	131	" and German prisoners , quite a good few , and these thirty girls . Mrs. Fergusson begs us to come . Sunday 's no good because we could n't see the work , but -- after the harvest ? We could get there with the pony quite well . "
11491	11499	11501	11501	Rachel	129	" Ca n't you go without me ? "
11519	11525	11527	11527	Janet	131	" Well , I could , "
11533	11550	11527	11527	Janet	131	" but I thought you were curious to see these new kinds of work for women ? "
11551	11562	11595	11595	Rachel	129	" So I am . It is n't the women . "
11563	11570	11572	11572	Janet	131	" The German prisoners , then ? "
11574	11579	11595	11595	Rachel	129	" Heavens , no ! "
11580	11584	11586	11586	Janet	131	" The Canadians ? "
11601	11615	11616	11616	she	129	" Well , I did n't have exactly a good time in Canada , "
11632	11646	11616	11616	she	129	" but of course I 'll go -- sometime -- after the harvest . "
11789	11797	11798	11798	she	131	" Shall we have prayers at night ? "
11813	11823	11798	11798	she	131	" Do n't if you do n't want to . "

12383	12385	12378	12378	Janet	131	" Words "
12686	12691	12692	12692	Janet	131	" A jolly view ! "
13062	13068	13097	13097	Rachel	129	" rubble and woody wreck , "
13092	13095	13097	13097	Rachel	129	" Look ! "
13203	13207	13209	13209	Janet	131	" German prisoners ! "
13244	13365	13236	13243	the English troops to the west of Rheims:--	786	" The beggars are on the run ! Foch has got them this time . But , oh , Lord , the sight they 've made of all this beautiful country ! Trampled , and ruined , and smashed ! all of it . Deliberate loot and malice everywhere , and tales of things done in the villages that make one see red . We captured a letter to his wife on a dead German this morning : ' Well , the offensive is a failure , but we 've done one thing -- we've smashed up another bit of France ! ' How are we ever going to live with this people in the same world after the war ? "
13643	13653	13655	13655	Janet	131	" But have n't you seen all this before ? "
13657	13667	13624	13624	Rachel	129	" No , I never saw anything of lumbering . "
13995	14034	13987	13987	She	143	" Well , here we meet again ! Jolly to see you ! A new scene , is n't it ? Life does n't stand still nowadays ! One of my girls will take the carriage for you . "
14074	14224	14046	14047	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" You see those tall fellows farthest off ? Those work the saws and cut up the trees as they come down . Then the horses bring them to the rollers , and the Canadians guide them with those hooks till the crane seizes hold of them and lifts them on to the trolley . But before the hooks get them -- you see the girls there?--they do all the measuring ; they note everything in their books and they mark every log . All the payments of the camp , the wages paid , the sums earned by the trolley contractor who takes them to the station , the whole finance in fact , depends on the _ women _ . I 've trained scores besides and sent them out to other camps ! But now come , I must introduce you to the commandant of the camp . "
14225	14229	14231	14231	Janet	131	" A Canadian ? "
14233	14295	14297	14297	she	131	" No , an American ! He comes from Maine , but he had been lumbering in Canada , with several mills and , camps under him . So he volunteered a year ago to bring over a large Forestry battalion -- mostly the men he had been working with in Quebec . Splendid fellows ! But he 's the king ! "
14301	14305	14297	14297	she	131	" Captain Ellesborough ! "
14427	14436	14437	14437	he	837	" You would like to see the camp ? "
14444	14454	14437	14437	he	837	" Are n't you too busy to show it ? "
14455	14475	14476	14476	He	837	" Not at all . I am not wanted just now . Let me help you over those logs . "
14482	14495	14497	14497	Rachel	129	" Oh , thank you , I do n't want any help , "
14648	14657	14659	14660	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" They ca n't talk to you now ! "
14673	14690	14659	14660	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" but they 'll talk at tea . And there 's a dance to - night . "
14700	14704	14691	14691	Janet	131	" Who come ? "
14705	14766	14659	14660	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" Oh , there 's an Air Force camp half a mile away -- an Army Service camp on the other side . The officers come -- some of them -- every Saturday . We take down the partitions in our huts . You ca n't think what pretty frocks the girls put on ! And we dance till midnight . "
14767	14781	14691	14691	Janet	131	" And you 've no difficulty with the men working in the camp ? "
14782	14793	14795	14796	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" You mean -- how do they treat the girls ? "
14798	14820	14821	14821	she	143	" They 're _ charming _ to the girls ! Chivalrous , kind , everything they should be . But then , "
14825	14860	14821	14821	she	143	" my girls are the pick -- educated women all of them . I could trust them anywhere . And Captain Ellesborough -- you wo n't get any mischief going on where he is . "
14905	14913	14914	14914	she	143	" Which works hardest , I wonder ? "
14930	14960	14914	14914	she	143	" We on our farm , or you here ? I 've never had more than five hours ' sleep through the harvest ? But now things are slacker . "
14970	15030	14961	14961	He	847	" Why , this seems to me like playing at lumbering ! It 's all so tiny -- so babyish . Oh , yes , there 's plenty of work -- for the moment . But it 'll be all done , in one more season ; not a stick left . England ca n't grow a real forest . "
15031	15036	15058	15058	she	143	" Compared to America ? "
15037	15051	14961	14961	He	847	" Well , I was thinking of Canada . Do you know Canada ? "
15052	15056	15058	15058	she	143	" A little . "
15062	15070	15058	15058	she	143	" But I never saw any lumbering . "
15071	15144	14961	14961	He	847	" What a pity ! It 's a gorgeous life . Oh , not for women . These women here -- awfully nice girls , and awfully clever too -- couldn't make anything of it in Canada . I had a couple of square miles of forest to look after -- magnificent stuff!--Douglas fir most of it -- and two pulping mills , and about two hundred men -- a rough lot . "
15145	15152	15058	15058	she	143	" But you 're not Canadian ? "
15153	15313	14961	14961	He	847	" Oh , Lord , no ! My people live in Maine . I was at Yale . I got trained at the forest school there , and after a bit went over the Canadian frontier with my brother to work a big concession in Quebec . We did very well -- made a lot of money . Then came the war . My brother joined up with the Canadian army . I stayed behind to try and settle up the business , till the States went in , too . Then they set me and some other fellows to raise a Forestry battalion -- picked men . We went to France first , and last winter I was sent here -- to boss this little show ! But I sha n't stay here long ! It is n't good enough . Besides , I want to fight ! They 've promised me a commission in our own army . "
15519	15529	15531	15532	the captain	847	" We do n't have any trouble with them , "
15535	15599	15531	15532	the captain	847	" They 're only too thankful to be here . They 've two corporals of their own who keep order . Oh , of course we have our eyes open . There are some sly beggars among them . Our men have no truck with them . I should n't advise you to employ them . It would n't do for women alone . "
15670	15680	15681	15681	she	129	" Once or twice they 've jeered at me , "
15686	15691	15692	15692	he	847	" Jeered at you ! "
15697	15711	15681	15681	she	129	" At my dress , I mean . It seems to amuse them . "
15712	15726	15681	15681	she	129	" I see . You wear the land army dress like these girls ? "
15727	15734	15681	15681	she	129	" When I 'm at work . "
15735	15748	15749	15749	he	847	" Well , I 'm glad you do n't wear it always , "
15753	15768	15749	15749	he	847	" These girls here look awfully nice of an evening . They always change . "
15877	15881	15872	15872	Unmarried	151	" Miss Henderson ? "
15911	15932	15933	15933	he	847	" Well , if I came across these fellows jeering at an Englishwoman , I 'd know the reason why ! "
15937	15943	15933	15933	he	847	" You should have complained . "
15951	15970	15944	15944	She	129	" One does n't want to be a nuisance in war time . One can always protect oneself . "
15974	15991	15946	15946	her	129	" That 's what women always say , and -- excuse me -- they ca n't ! "
15995	16007	15992	15992	She	129	" Oh , yes , we can -- the modern woman . "
16008	16026	16027	16027	he	847	" I do n't see much difference between the modern woman and the old - fashioned woman , "
16031	16045	16027	16027	he	847	" It is n't dress or working at munitions that makes the difference . "
16046	16055	15992	15992	She	129	" No , but -- what they signify . "
16056	16072	16027	16027	he	847	" What?--a freer life , getting your own way , seeing more of the world ? "
16080	16089	16090	16090	she	129	" _ Knowing _ more of the world , "
16095	16117	16090	16090	she	129	" We 're not the ignorant babes our grandmothers were at our age . That 's why we can protect ourselves . "
16420	16431	16397	16397	She	129	" Oh , I dare say that 's all nonsense ! "
16661	16669	16658	16658	his	847	" Good Heavens ! what 's that ? "
16732	16738	16740	16740	Ellesborough	149	" The cable 's broken ! "
16843	16856	16857	16857	Ellesborough	149	" The cable snapped , and has caught him round the body , "
16860	16874	16857	16857	Ellesborough	149	" Give him this brandy , please , while I try and make out-- "
16887	16895	16896	16896	He	149	" A rib broken , I think . "
16912	16958	16896	16896	He	149	" I must go down and get some men and a stretcher . They wo n't know what to do without me . My second in command is off duty for the day . Can you look after him while I go ? Awfully sorry to-- "
16972	16985	16970	16970	him	149	" Tell me what to do , and I 'll do it . "

17053	17069	17071	17071	Ellesborough	149	" Give him more brandy if you can , and try and keep him still , "
17079	17086	17071	17071	Ellesborough	149	" I shall be back directly . "

24638	24661	24600	24600	his	149	" Why , no one but a plucky woman could have taken this farm and be working it as you 're doing . "
24662	24668	24669	24669	she	129	" That 's not pluck , "
24675	24716	24669	24669	she	129	" But if it is -- well , I 've got plenty of pluck of that kind . But I am often scared , downright scared , about nothing . It 's just fear , that 's what it is . "

25350	25384	25335	25335	he	3153	" There is n't scarcely a lodging or a cottage to be had . Partly it 's the holidays still , and partly it 's silly folk like you -- scared of raids . "

We 've got the upper hand now , and the Boche will keep his planes at home . But as you wo n't listen to me , you 've got to have your way , I suppose . Well , I 've got you rooms of a sort .

Everybody in America 's growing something , and making something . When a man thinks he 's done enough , and wants to rest a bit , the man next him gets behind him with a bradawl . There 's no rest for anybody . We 've just registered _ thirteen million _ men . That sounds like business , does n't it ? No slacking there ! Well , we mean business . And you mean business .

29033	29065	29029	29029	Halsey	114	" Aye , it 's a queer business . But they do be cleverer at it than ye'd think . Miss Henderson 's a good head - piece of her own . "

29916	29992	29786	29786	he	182	" Noa , she ai n't . She 's the farmer herself--'at 's what she is . She 's took the farm from Colonel Shepherd -- she did -- all on her own . To be sure there 's Miss Leighton as lives with her . But it do seem to me as Miss Henderson's -- as you might say -- the top ' un . And me an ' James Halsey works for her . "

My husband 's determined to stop this kind of thing . Do n't imagine you can either threaten us , or come round us . We have tried again and again to help and reform you . It is no good -- and now we give you up . You have worn us out . If you are wise , you will not answer this -- and if you keep quiet the allowance shall be continued . MARIANNE TILNEY . "

He declares that he called to the man -- who was like nobody he had ever seen before -- and the man took no notice , but went along , all hunched up -- as they say the ghost is -- and talking to himself -- till all of a sudden he vanished . I 've argued with him . But nothing'll hold him -- old idiot ! He vows he 'll go --- and if he talks to the others they 'll all go . "
33986	33992	33994	33994	Janet	131	" Has he gone home ? "
33996	34045	33801	33801	Janet	131	" Long ago . He left the horses to Jenny , and just marched off . In the lane he met me , and gave notice . Such a cock - and - bull story as you never heard ! But I could n't do anything with him . "

35309	35314	35316	35316	Rachel	129	" And -- peace ? "
35368	35375	35377	35377	Ellesborough	149	" There will be no peace ! "

35442	35451	35421	35422	The male	1700	" And if they do n't accept that ? "
35452	35460	35461	35461	he	149	" Then the war will go on , "
35465	35476	35461	35461	he	149	" and I shall be in for the last lap ! "
35498	35512	35483	35483	She	129	" If it does go on , it will be fiercer than ever . "
35513	35534	35483	35483	She	129	" Very likely . If our fellows set the pace there 'll be no dawdling . America 's white hot . "
35535	35543	35483	35483	She	129	" And you 'll be in it ? "
35544	35549	35550	35550	he	149	" I hope so , "
35834	35837	35821	35821	He	149	" Rachel ! "
35900	35902	35903	35903	He	149	" Rachel!-- "
35934	35942	35930	35930	she	129	" Do n't --don't say anything -- till-- "
36008	36011	36012	36012	she	129	" Wait!--wait ! "
36109	36119	36120	36120	she	129	" I 've got something to say to you , "
36127	36244	36120	36120	she	129	" which -- I'm afraid -- will surprise you very much . Of course I ought to have told you -- long ago . But I 'm a coward , and -- and -- it was all so horrible . I am not what you suppose me . I'm -- a married woman -- at least I was . I divorced my husband -- eighteen months ago . I 'm quite free now . I thought if you really cared about me -- I should of course have to tell you some time -- but I 've been letting it go on . It was very wrong of me -- I know it was very wrong ! "
36538	36549	36528	36528	his	1722	" Do n't cry so , dear -- don't cry ! "
36576	36580	36581	36581	she	1719	" Sit there ! "
36597	36602	36592	36592	she	1719	" Where is Janet ? "
36603	36610	36611	36611	Rachel	129	" She went to the village . "
36628	36643	36655	36655	he	1722	" I 'll try and tell it shortly . It 's a horrible tale . "
36644	36653	36655	36655	he	1722	" Do you feel able to tell it ? "
36669	36673	36674	36674	she	1719	" I must , "
36677	36693	36674	36674	she	1719	" Were n't you -- weren't you just going to ask me to marry you ? "
36699	36703	36704	36704	he	1722	" I was , "
36708	36716	36704	36704	he	1722	" Did n't you know I should ? "
36717	36727	36728	36728	she	1719	" No , no , I did n't know ! "
36732	36750	36728	36728	she	1719	" I was never _ sure_--till you looked at me then . I would n't be sure ! "
36770	36780	36781	36781	she	1719	" It all began to happen three years ago , "
36800	37020	37023	37023	she	1735	" I was living with my brother , who was then near Winnipeg . He offered me a home after my father died . But he was married , and I did n't get on with his wife . I dare say it was my fault , but I was n't happy , and I wanted to get away . Then a man -- an Englishman -- bought the next section to us , and we began to know him . He was a gentleman -- he'd been to Cambridge -- his father had some land and a house in Lincolnshire . But he was the third son , and he 'd been taught land agency , he said , as a training for the colonies . That was all we knew . He was very good - looking , and he began courting me . I suppose I was proud of his being a University man -- a public school boy , and all that . He told me a lot of stories about his people , and his money -- most of which were lies . But I was a fool -- and I believed them . My brother tried to stop it . Well , you know from his letters what sort of man he is , "
37030	37059	37023	37023	she	1735	" But his wife made mischief , and I was set on having a place of my own . So I stuck to it -- and married him . "
37156	37166	37167	37167	she	1735	" What 's the good of going into it ! "
37173	37180	37167	37167	she	1735	" You can guess -- what it means"--a
37186	37267	37268	37268	She	1735	cheeks--"to be tied to a man -- without honour -- or principle -- or refinement -- who presently seemed to me vile all through -- in what he said -- or what he did . And I was at his mercy . I had married him in such a hurry he had a right to despise me , and he used it ! And when I resisted and turned against him , then I found out what his temper meant . "
37280	37293	37270	37270	her	1735	" Well -- we got on somehow till my little girl was born-- "
37349	37477	37333	37333	she	129	" She only lived a few weeks . Her death was largely owing to him . But that 's a long story . And after her death I could n't stand it any more . I ran away . And soon I heard that he had taken up with an Italian girl . There was a large camp of Italians on the C.P.R. , quite close to us . She was the daughter of one of the foremen . So then my brother made me go to his lawyers in Winnipeg . We collected evidence very easily . I got my divorce eighteen months ago . The decree was made absolute last February . So , of course , I 'm quite free -- quite--_quite _ free ! "
37515	37522	37523	37523	he	149	" The action was not defended ? "
37544	37552	37542	37542	she	1738	" I can show you the report . "
37593	37813	37576	37576	she	1738	" It has all come so suddenly -- hasn't it ? I had been in such good spirits to - day , not thinking of those horrible things at all . I do n't know what I meant to do , if you did ask me -- for of course I knew you _ might _ . I suppose I intended to put off telling you -- so as to be sure first--_certain_--that you loved me . And then -- somehow -- when you looked down on me like that , I felt -- that _ I _ cared -- much more than I had thought I cared -- too much to let you speak -- before you knew -- before I 'd told you . It 's always been my way -- to -- put off disagreeable things . And so I thought I could put this off . But every night I have been awake thinking--'if only he knew!'--and I was wretched -- for a while -- because you did n't know . But then it went away again -- and I forgot it . One does forget things -- everything -- when one is hard at work . But I 'm awfully sorry . And now -- I think -- we'd better say good - bye . "
37826	37831	37832	37832	he	1740	" No -- no , "
37836	37861	37832	37832	he	1740	" we wo n't say good - bye . But you must let me think -- for you , as well as for myself . "
37862	37873	37874	37874	she	1739	" It would be better to say good - bye , "
37877	37953	37874	37874	she	1739	" I 'm afraid -- you expect in me -- what I have n't got . I see that now . Because I 'm keen about this work , and I can run this farm , you think -- perhaps -- I'm a strong character . But I 'm not . I 've no judgment -- not in moral things . I give in -- I'm weak -- and then -- I could kill myself ! "
38020	38025	38026	38026	she	1739	" There 's Janet ! "
38029	38037	38026	38026	she	1739	" we ca n't talk any more . "
38055	38069	38070	38070	he	1741	" Can you meet me to - morrow evening -- on the Common ? "
38073	38081	38070	38070	he	1741	" I could be there about six . "
38087	38093	38082	38082	She	1739	" Is it worth while ? "
38094	38099	38100	38100	he	1741	" I beg you ! "
38104	38119	38082	38082	She	1739	" Very well -- I'll come . We shall be just friends , please . "
38120	38136	38137	38137	Janet	131	" But , of course , I 'll tell you more -- if you wish . "
39107	39111	39112	39112	she	129	" not a bad woman!"--as
39291	39304	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" You ca n't live a lie beside him all your life ! "
39305	39349	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" It wo n't be a lie . All that matters to him is what I am now -- not what I was . And it was n't I!--it was another woman -- a miserable , battered creature who could n't help herself . "
39350	39373	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" It will rise up between you , and perhaps -- after all -- in some way -- he will discover it . "
39374	39397	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" How can he ? Dick and I -- who in all the world knew , but us two?--and Dick is dead . "
39398	39413	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" Are you sure that no one knew:--that no one saw you ? Think ! "
39427	39441	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" There was that wagon -- and the boy -- in the storm . "
39442	39448	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" Yes -- what then ? "
39449	39461	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" Well -- what then ? The boy scarcely saw me . "
39462	39468	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" He did see you . "
39469	39498	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" And if he did -- it is the commonest thing in a Canadian winter to be caught by a storm , to ask shelter from a neighbour . "
39499	39529	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" Still -- even if he drew no malicious conclusion , he saw you -- alone in that farm with Dick Tanner , and he probably knew your name . "
39530	39538	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" How should he know my name ? "
39539	39552	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" He had seen you before -- you had seen him before . "
39553	39568	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" I did n't know his name -- I do n't know it now . "
39569	39600	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" No -- but in passing your farm once , he had dropped a parcel for a neighbour -- and you had seen him once -- at a railway station . "
39601	39627	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" Is it the least likely that I shall ever see him again -- or that he remembers seeing me at Dick Tanner 's door ? "
39628	39640	39278	39279	the Accuser	1772	" Not likely , perhaps -- but possible -- quite possible . "
39895	39915	40046	40047	Rachel Henderson	129	" How _ could _ I have resisted ? I was so miserable -- so lonely -- so weak ! "
39916	39923	40046	40047	Rachel Henderson	129	" You did n't love him ! "
39924	39935	40046	40047	Rachel Henderson	129	" No -- but I was alone in the world . "
39936	39955	40046	40047	Rachel Henderson	129	" Well , then , tell George Ellesborough -- he is a reasonable man -- he would understand . "
39956	40024	40046	40047	Rachel Henderson	129	" I ca n't --I _ ca n't _ ! I have deceived him up till now by passing as unmarried . If I confess this , too , there will be no chance for me . He 'll never trust me in anything!--he'll suspect everything I do or say -- even if he goes on loving me . And I could n't bear it!--nor could he . "

41197	41221	41392	41392	Betts	182	" but as Halsey had gone to bed immediately after Miss Leighton had had her say with him , and had refused to be "
41223	41247	41392	41392	Betts	182	" even by his wife , there was a good deal of uncertainty even in the mind of his oldest pal , Peter Betts .
41248	41253	41255	41255	Halsey	114	" Why -- ghostisses ! "
41274	41333	41255	41255	Halsey	114	" I do n't see as a man can be expected to deal with ghostisses . Anythin ' else yer like in a small way -- mad dogs , or bulls , or snakes , where they keep 'em , which , thank the Lord , they do n't in these parts -- but not _ them _ . "
41334	41340	41342	41342	Betts	182	" What did yer see ? "
41350	41375	41377	41377	Halsey	114	" Well , I saw old Watson , the keeper , as was murdered sixty years since , ' at 's what I saw , "
41382	41390	41392	41392	Betts	182	" An ' what might be like ? "
41462	41479	41525	41525	He	202	" Well , I saw a man come creepin ' an ' crouchin ' down yon grass road"--(it

41813	41826	41805	41805	He	182	" Ghostisses do n't cough , as ever I ' eered on . "
41827	41834	41836	41836	Halsey	114	" And why should n't they ? "
41839	41870	41836	41836	Halsey	114	" If they can do them other things they 'd used to do when livin'--walkin ' an ' seein ' an ' such - like -- why not coughin ' ? "
41876	41883	41884	41884	he	182	" Never ' eered on it , "
41890	41974	41975	41977	The old man	292	" Well , anyways I seed him come down to that shed , an ' then I lost ' i m. But I ' ad the creeps somehow and I called to Jenny to come an ' take the ' orses . An ' then I went after ' i m. But there was all the field an ' the lane to cross , and when I come to the shed , there was n't no one and nothink to be seen -- excep'-- "
41988	41991	41993	41993	Betts	182	" Well ? "
42004	42027	42029	42029	Halsey	114	" Excep'--a large patch o ' blood--_fresh blood_--I touched it -- on one of them ole sacks lyin ' near the cart , "
42032	42050	42029	42029	Halsey	114	" An ' it worn't there in the afternoon , for I moved the sacks mysel ' . "
42057	42132	42133	42134	old man	1847	" There was nothin' moved -- or taken away -- nothin' at all!--only that patch . So then I went all round the farm , and there was nobody . I thought ' ee might ha ' turned back by the grass road , p'raps , without my seein ' ' i m , so I went that way , and there was nothin'--until -- a little way up the road -- there was blood again"--the
42137	42183	42133	42134	old man	1847	dropped--"every couple o ' yards or so -- a drop or two here -- an ' a drop or two there -- just as they tracked old Watson by it , up the hill , and into yon wood -- where Dempsey set on him . "
42198	42206	42133	42134	old man	1847	" Are you sure it was blood ? "
42207	42374	42133	42134	old man	1847	" Sure . Last night , Hastings said it was sheep - dip ! After I tole ' i m , when ' ee went to look under the shed , it wor so dark ' ee could n't see nothin' . Well , ' ee knew better this mornin ' . ' Ee fetched me , an ' asst me if I 'd said anythin ' to Miss Janet . And I said , no . So then he tole me I was n't to say nothin' to the ladies , nor the girls , nor anybody . An ' ' ee'd done summat wi ' the sack -- I dunno what . But ' ee might ha ' held ' is tongue last night about sheep - dip ! Who 's been dippin ' sheep about here ? ' As Miss Henderson got any ruddle anywhere about the farm ? I know she ai n't ! --an ' Muster Hastings knows she ai n't . "
42375	42387	42133	42134	old man	1847	" Why did n't yer tell Miss Janet?--about the bleedin ' ? "
42388	42446	42133	42134	old man	1847	" Well , I was a bit skeered . I thought I 'd sleep on't , before I got talkin ' any more . But on the way ' ome , as I tellt yer , I met Hastings , an ' tole ' _ i m _ , an ' then give ' i m notice . "
42447	42457	42459	42459	Betts	182	" That wor a bit hasty , worn't it ? "
42497	42506	42507	42507	Halsey	114	" Well , it might ha ' bin , "
42510	42566	42507	42507	Halsey	114	" but as I said afore , I 'm gettin ' an old man , and I do n't want no truck wi ' things as I do n't unnerstan ' . It give me the wust night as I 've had since I had that bad turn wi ' the influenza ten year ago . "
42567	42575	42655	42655	Hastings	127	" You did n't see his face ? "

42634	42654	42631	42631	Betts	182	" it 's as curous as the coughin ' . Did you iver hear tell as ghosts could bleed ? "
42686	42697	42674	42674	Betts	182	" Have yer thought o ' tellin ' John Dempsey ? "
42698	42737	42674	42674	Betts	182	" I hain't thought o ' tellin ' nobody . An ' I should n't ha ' told Miss Leighton what I did tell her , if she ' adn't come naggin ' about my givin ' notice . "

43648	43661	43663	43663	Janet	131	" Did you think that would be news to any of us ? "
43689	43717	43645	43645	She	129	" Do n't , Janet , please . I told him something -- which made him wonder -- whether he did want to marry me after all . "
43738	43745	43718	43718	Janet	131	" What did you tell him ? "
43746	43799	43718	43718	Janet	131	" What I see now I ought to have told you -- as well as him -- long ago . Henderson is my maiden name . I was a married woman for three years . I had a child which died . I divorced my husband , and he 's still alive . "
43820	43834	43836	43836	Rachel	129	" I did tell you I had a story , did n't I ? "
43839	43858	43718	43718	Janet	131	" You did . I took my chance . It was you who -- who brought the action ? "
43859	43912	43942	43942	she	131	" I brought the action . There was no defence . And the judge said -- I'd been awfully badly treated -- it was no wonder I wanted -- to get free . Well , there it is . I 'm sorry I deceived you . I 'm sorry I deceived him . "
43913	43920	43922	43922	Janet	131	" You did n't deceive me , "
43924	43931	43932	43932	She	131	" I had practically guessed it . "
43949	43961	43942	43942	she	131	" Why did n't you tell me , you poor thing ! "
43990	44006	43987	43987	her	129	" Because I wanted never to hear of it -- or think of it again . "
44016	44041	44013	44013	she	129	" But if you want to know more , I 'll tell you . It 's your right . My married name was Delane . "
44042	44050	44052	44052	Janet	131	" Do n't tell me any more ! "
44055	44078	44052	44052	Janet	131	" I do n't want to hear it . But you ought to be -- quite frank -- with _ him _ . "
44079	44094	44101	44101	her	131	" I know that . Naturally -- it was a great shock to him . "
44256	44262	44247	44247	Janet	131	" When is he coming ? "
44263	44278	44279	44279	Janet	131	" To - morrow evening . I dare say he 'll give me up . "
44371	44397	44366	44366	her	131	" My dear , he wo n't give you up ! As if I had n't seen ! He worships the ground you tread upon ! "
44697	44712	44695	44695	she	207	" wrapped it lovingly in red flannel , describing the evening dressing of it as "
44718	44722	44723	44723	her	207	" and talked of "
44724	44741	44695	44695	she	207	" qualities and oddities as though , in the phrase of her next - door neighbour , "
44750	44807	44746	44748	a christened child	1906	" She had decided views on politics , and was a match for any political agent who might approach her with an eye to her vote , a commodity which she kept , so to speak , like a new shilling in her pocket , turning it from time to time to make sure it was there .
45073	45088	45046	45046	he	1294	" All right -- I've done -- you may take it or leave it . "
45089	45109	45110	45110	Dempsey	194	" Well , I do n't see that what you saw , Mr. Halsey , was so very uncommon ! "
45125	45159	45110	45110	Dempsey	194	" You saw a man come down that road ? Well , in the first place , why should n't a man come down that road -- it 's a reg'lar right of way-- "
45160	45179	45182	45183	Peter Betts	182	" It 's the way , mind ye , as the ghost of old Watson has allus come ! "
45204	45245	45191	45191	Halsey	114	" An ' it 's been seen twice on that road already , as I can remember : once when I was a little boy , by old Dan Holt , the postmaster , and once about ten years ago . "
45497	45526	45528	45528	Betts	182	" Well , if yer do n't think that man as Halsey saw _ was _ the ghost , what do you s'pose ' ee was doin' there ? "
45530	45602	45528	45528	Betts	182	" and where did he go ? Halsey went right round the farm . The hill just there is as bare as my hand . He must ha ' seen the man -- if it _ wor _ a man -- an ' he saw nothin' . There is n't a tree or a bush where that man could ha ' hid hisself -- if he _ wor _ a man . "
45745	45786	45741	45741	Dempsey	194	" Well , it 's curious , grant ye . It 's real funny ! But where are you going to get blood without a body ? And if a thing 's a body , it is n't a ghost ! "
45927	45934	45913	45913	Halsey	114	" A spirit hath not flesh and blood"--True
45944	45948	45913	45913	Halsey	114	" bodies of the saints"--that

46399	46405	46407	46407	Dempsey	194	" Why should n't I ? "
46409	46427	46407	46407	Dempsey	194	" when it 's sixty years ago . They 've lost their chance of hanging him anyhow . "
46440	46456	46372	46373	Mrs. Halsey	207	" I would n't advise you to be tellin ' that tale to Miss Henderson . "
46470	46488	46372	46373	Mrs. Halsey	207	" By the way , who is Miss Henderson ? Do you know where she comes from ? "
46493	46497	46499	46499	Betts	182	" Last winter , "
46525	46525	46522	46523	Miss Janet	131	"
46526	46533	46549	46549	she	1962	" Was she ever in Canada ? "
46534	46537	46539	46539	Halsey	207	" Yes ! "
46636	46636	46628	46628	I	0	"
46637	46640	46642	46642	Dempsey	194	" Ah ! "
46649	46664	46642	46642	Dempsey	194	" And she 's not married ? You 're sure she 's not married ? "
46665	46668	46670	46672	all the others	1968	" Married ? "
46681	46730	46642	46642	Dempsey	194	" Well , if she ai n't , I saw her sister -- or her double -- twice -- about two - and - a - half year ago -- at a place thirty miles from Winnipeg . I could ha ' sworn I 'd seen her before ! "
46731	46743	46745	46745	Betts	182	" Well , you ca n't ha ' seen her before , "
46748	46757	46745	46745	Betts	182	" cause she 's Miss , not Missis . "
46758	46761	46763	46763	Dempsey	194	" Ah ! "
46780	46791	46793	46794	Mrs. Halsey	207	" Where have you seen her -- in these parts ? "
46796	46828	46851	46852	Mrs. Halsey	207	" At the Harvest Festival , t'other day . But I must have been mistaken -- that 's all . I think I 'm going to call upon her some day . "
46829	46833	46851	46852	Mrs. Halsey	207	" Whatever for ? "
46834	46844	46846	46846	Dempsey	194	" Why -- to tell her about my grandfather ! "
46868	46875	46851	46852	Mrs. Halsey	207	" You wo n't be welcome . "
46876	46880	46851	46852	Mrs. Halsey	207	" Why not ? "
46881	46905	46907	46908	Mrs. Halsey	207	" Because she do n't want to hear nothin' about Watson 's murder . And whatever 's the good on it , anyhow ? "
46913	46972	46907	46908	Mrs. Halsey	207	" You 've told us a good tale , I 'll grant ye . But yer might as well be pullin ' the old feller ' isself out of his grave , as goin' round killin ' ' i m every night fresh , as you be doin' . Let ' i m be . Skelintons is skelintons . "
47041	47064	47029	47030	Mrs. Halsey	207	" I ' ad to pike ' i m out soomhow . It 's ' igh time she wor put to bed ! "
47462	47475	47452	47452	She	129	" Going to a Food meeting ! But Rachel 's at home . "
47897	47904	47895	47895	she	129	him,--"You'd like to hear it all ? "
48046	48264	48270	48270	She	2016	" I nursed her for years . I never did anything else -- I could n't . I never had any amusements like other girls . There was no money and no time . She died when I was twenty - four . And three months after , my father died . He did n't leave a penny . Then my brother asked me to go and live with him and his wife . I was to have my board and a dress allowance , if I would help her in the house . My brother 's an awfully good sort -- but I could n't get on with his wife . I just could n't ! I expect it was my fault , just as much as hers . It was something we could n't help . Very soon I hated the sight of her , and she never missed a chance of making me feel a worm -- a useless , greedy creature , living on other people 's work . If only there had been some children , I dare say I could have borne it . But she and I could never get away from each other . There were no distractions . Our nerves got simply raw -- at least mine did . "
48282	48358	48272	48272	her	2016	" I suppose my mother would have borne it . But girls nowadays ca n't . Not girls like me , anyway . Mother was a Christian . I do n't suppose I am . I do n't know what I am . I just _ had _ to live my own life . I could n't exist without a bit of pleasure -- and being admired -- and seeing men -- and all that ! "
48389	48403	48372	48372	Ellesborough	149	" Well then -- this man Delane -- came to live near you ? "
48425	48648	48417	48417	She	2016	" I met him at a dance in Winnipeg first -- the day after I 'd had a horrid row with my sister - in - law . He 'd just taken a large farm , with a decent house on it -- not a shack -- and everybody said his people were rich and were backing him . And he was very good - looking -- and a Cambridge man -- and all that . We danced together almost all the evening . Then he found out where I lived , and used to be always coming to see me . My brother never liked him . He said to me often , ' Why do you encourage that unprincipled cad ? I 'm certain there 's a screw loose about him ! ' And I was n't in love with Roger -- not really -- for one moment . But I _ think _ he was in love with me -- yes , I 'm sure he was -- at first . And he excited and interested me . I was proud , too , of taking him away from other girls , who were always running after him . And my sister - in - law was just mad to get rid of me ! Do n't you understand ? "
48649	48655	48665	48665	his	2018	" Of course I do ! "
48668	48740	48656	48656	Her	2017	" Well , then , we got married . My brother tried to get out of him what his money - affairs were . But he always evaded everything . He talked a great deal about this rich sister , and she did send him a wedding present . But he never showed me her letter , and that was the last we ever heard of her while I knew him .... "
48768	48837	48839	48839	she	2017	" Well , it 's a hateful story -- and as common!--as common as dirt . We began to quarrel almost immediately . He was jealous and tyrannical , and I always had a quick temper . I found that he drank , that he told me all sorts of lies about his past life , that he presently only cared about me as -- well , as his mistress!"--and
48846	49199	48839	48839	she	2017	eyes--"that he was hopelessly in debt -- a gambler -- and everything else . When the baby came , I could only get the wife of a neighbouring settler to come and look after me . And Roger behaved so abominably to her that she went home when the baby was a week old -- and I was left to manage for myself . Then when baby was three months old , she caught whooping - cough , and had bronchitis on the top . I had a few pounds of my own , and I gave them to Roger to go in to Winnipeg and bring out a doctor and medicines . He drank all the money on the way -- that I found out afterwards -- he was a week away instead of two days -- and the baby died . When he came back he told me a lie about having been ill . But I never lived with him -- as a wife -- after that . Then , of course , he hated me , and one night he nearly killed me . Next morning he apologized -- said that he loved me passionately -- and that kind of stuff -- that I was cruel to him -- and what could he do to make up ? So then I suggested that he should go away for a month -- and we should both think things over . He was rather frightened , because -- well -- he'd knocked me about a good deal in the horrible scene between us -- and he thought I should bring my brother down on him . So he agreed to go , and I said I would have a girl friend to stay with me . But , of course , as soon as he was gone , I just left the house and departed . I had got evidence enough by then to set me free -- about the Italian girl . I met my brother in Winnipeg . We went to his lawyers together , and I began proceedings-- "
49204	49415	49200	49200	She	2020	" The rest I told you.--_No!_--I've told you the horrible things -- now I 'll say something of the things which -- have made life worth living again . Till the divorce was settled I went back to my brother in Toronto . I dropped my married name then and called myself Henderson . And then I came home -- because my mother 's brother , who was a manufacturer in Bradford , wrote to ask me . But when I arrived he was dead , and he had left me three thousand pounds . Then I went to Swanley and got trained for farm - work . And I found Janet Leighton , and we made friends . And I love farm - work -- and I love Janet -- and the whole world looks so different to me ! Why , of course , I did n't want to be reminded of that old horrible life ! I did n't want people to say , ' Mrs. Delane ? Who and where is her husband ? Is he dead ? ' ' No -- she 's divorced . ' ' Why ? ' There's!--don't you see?--all the old vile business over again ! So I cut it all ! "
49427	49483	49416	49416	She	2021	" And yet -- it seems -- you ca n't do a simple thing like that without -- hurting somebody -- injuring somebody . I ca n't help it ! I did n't mean to deceive _ you _ . But I had a right to get free from the old life if I could ! "
49503	49601	49499	49499	she	2021	" There!--I've told you . I suppose you do n't want to be friends with me any more . It was rotten of me , I know , for , of course -- I saw -- you seemed to be getting to care for me . I told Janet when we set up work together that I was n't a bad woman . And I 'm not . But I 'm weak . You 'd better not trust me . And besides -- I fell into the mud -- and I expect it sticks to me still ! "
49621	49687	49602	49602	She	2022	" I 've told him!--I've told him ! If he does n't understand , it 's not my fault . I can always say , ' I _ did _ tell you -- about Roger--_and the rest_!--as much as I was bound to tell you . ' Why should I make him miserable -- and destroy my own chances with him for _ nothing _ ? "
49758	49778	49752	49752	his	2025	" Darling!--I'll try and make up to you -- for all you 've suffered . Poor child!--poor little Rachel ! "
49797	49819	49794	49794	She	2022	" Now I shall be happy!--and I shall make him happy , too . Of course I shall!--I'm doing quite right . "
49991	50001	50002	50002	he	2025	" Do you know where that man is now ? "
50044	50184	50008	50008	She	2022	" Roger ? No , I have no idea . I always suppose he 's in Canada still . He never appeared when the case was tried . But the summons had to be served on him , and my lawyers succeeded in tracking him to a lodging in Calgary , where he was living -- with the Italian girl . But after that we never heard any more of him -- except that I had a little pencil note -- unsigned , undated , delivered by hand -- just before the trial came on . It said I should repent casting him off -- that I had treated him shamefully -- that I was a vile woman -- and though I had got the better of him for the time , he would have his revenge before long . "
50191	50207	50008	50008	She	2022	" Threats are cheap ! I hope you soon put that out of your mind ? "
50215	50245	50208	50208	She	2028	" Yes , I -- I suppose so . But I did tell you once , did n't I , that -- I often had fears -- about nothing ? "
50246	50254	50255	50255	he	149	" Yes , you did tell me , "
50260	50276	50255	50255	he	149	" Do n't have any more fears , darling ! I 'll see to that . "
50498	50574	50478	50478	she	2028	" I 've got a bit of money of my own . But first you must let me go back , as soon as there are ships to go in -- to see after my own humble business . We could launch out -- get some fine stock -- try experiments . It 's a going concern , and I 've got a good share in it . Why should n't you go , too ? "
50580	50588	50575	50575	He	149	" To Canada ? Oh , no ! "
50625	50634	50635	50635	he	149	" I should like to have seen Janet ! "
50639	50662	50635	50635	he	149	" She 'll have to get used to Christian names . How soon will you tell her ? Directly she comes in ? "
50663	50677	50678	50678	He	149	" Certainly not . I shall wait -- till to - morrow morning . "
50697	50726	50678	50678	He	149	" You wo n't wait ten minutes -- you could n't ! Well , I must be going , or they 'll shut me out of the camp . "
50727	50734	50678	50678	He	149	" Why do you hurry so ? "
50735	50760	50678	50678	He	149	" Hurry ? Why , I shall be an hour late , anyway . I shall have to give myself C.B. to - morrow . "
50781	50797	50771	50771	she	2028	" You do love me -- you do -- you will always!--whatever people may say ? "
50831	50835	50836	50836	she	2028	" Do go ! "
50843	50860	50836	50836	she	2028	" I 'd like to be a few minutes -- alone -- before they come back . "
51141	51148	51149	51149	she	129	" Did n't I do that ? "
51155	51159	51160	51160	He	149	" We forgot ! "
51165	51193	51160	51160	He	149	" Now it 's all cosy . Ah , there they are ! Perhaps I 'll get Janet to come as far as the road with me . "
51701	51705	51713	51713	She	2058	" Come in ! "
51726	51734	51713	51713	She	2058	" You 'll see Mr. Roger here ? "
51735	51745	51713	51713	She	2058	" Why , I told you so , Nannie ! "
51751	51759	51713	51713	She	2058	" Is everybody out of the way ? "
51799	51829	51848	51850	A tall man	2065	" I told them I 'd answer the bell . And I 'll keep an eye that no one comes down before he 's gone . There he is ! "
51855	51861	51862	51862	he	2065	" Beastly night , Nannie ! "
51874	51893	51862	51862	he	2065	" Do n't suit my style . Well?--how are you ? Had the flu , like everybody else ? "
51894	51916	51848	51850	A tall man	2065	" Not yet , Mr. Roger -- though it 's been going through the house . Shall I take your coat ? "
51917	51929	51862	51862	he	2065	" You 'd better not . I 'm too shabby underneath . "
51930	51941	51848	51850	A tall man	2065	" Sir Richard 's in the country , Mr. Roger . "
51942	51965	51862	51862	he	2065	" Oh , so her ladyship 's alone ? Well , that 's how I generally find her , is n't it ? "
52117	52122	52123	52123	he	2065	" Well , Marianne , "
52132	52151	52123	52123	he	2065	" You do n't seem particularly glad to see me . Hullo!--has Dick been buying some more china ? "
52201	52271	52272	52272	She	221	" I think you had better leave the china alone , Roger . I have only got a very few minutes . What do you want ? Money , I suppose -- as usual ! And yet I warned you in my last letter that you would do this kind of thing once too often , and that we were _ not _ going to put up with it ! "
52291	52337	52282	52282	Delane	179	" The vase is Ming all right -- better stuff than Dick generally buys . I congratulate him . Well , I 'm sorry for you , my dear Marianne -- but you _ are _ my sister -- and you ca n't help yourself ! "
52355	52395	52338	52338	He	2076	" Do n't talk like that , Roger ! Tell me directly what it is you want . You seem to think you can force me to see you at any time , whatever I may be doing . But-- "
52396	52411	52413	52413	Delane	179	" Your last letter was ' a bit thick'--you see -- it provoked me , "
52416	52457	52413	52413	Delane	179	" Of course you can get the police to chuck me out if you like . You would be quite in your rights . But I imagine the effect on the aristocratic nerves of Berkeley Square would be amusing . However-- "
52462	52489	52458	52458	He	2077	" As Carlyle said to the old Queen , ' I 'm getting old , madam , and with your leave I 'll take a chair-- ' "
52498	52514	52490	52490	He	2077	" And let me make up the fire . It 's beginning to freeze outside . "
52529	52545	52515	52516	Lady Winton	221	" There is quite enough fire , thank you . I am going out presently . "
52566	52571	52572	52572	he	2077	" Dick 's boots ! "
52588	52652	52572	52572	he	2077	" What a lot of wear I 've got out of them since he threw them away ! His overcoat , too . And now that it 's the thing to be shabby , Dick 's clothes are really a godsend . I defraud Jones . But I have no doubt that Jones gets a good deal more than is good for him . "
52653	52668	52670	52671	Marianne Winton	228	" Look here , Roger!--suppose you stop talking this nonsense and come to business , "
52677	52714	52670	52671	Marianne Winton	228	" I 've sent Jones out with a note -- but he 'll be back directly . And I 've got an appointment . What are you doing ? Have you got any work to do ? "
52741	52756	52757	52757	he	1111	" Oh , dear , no , I 've got no work to do , "
52762	52828	52757	52757	he	1111	" That 's not a commodity that comes my way . But I must somehow manage to keep a roof over Anita and the child . So what can I do but count on your assistance , my dear ? My father left you a great deal of money which in equity belonged to me -- and I am bound to remind you of it . "
52829	52841	52843	52844	Lady Winton	221	" You know very well why he left you so little ! "
52846	52866	52867	52867	She	221	" We need n't go into that old story . I ask you again , what do you want ? "
52873	52880	52867	52867	She	221	" I have just ten minutes . "
52881	52887	52888	52888	He	2080	" What do I want ? "
52899	52933	52888	52888	He	2080	" Money , my dear , money ! Money means everything that I must have -- food , coals , clothes , doctor , chemist , buses -- decent houseroom for Anita and myself-- "
52943	52950	52867	52867	She	221	" Have you married that woman ? "
52954	52998	53001	53001	his	2080	" As you seemed to think it desirable , Anita and I did take a trip to a Registry Office about a month ago . It 's all lawful now -- except for our abominable English law that does n't legitimize the children . But"--he
53008	53017	53018	53018	His	2080	her--"whom do you think I 've seen lately ? "
53045	53118	52867	52867	She	221	" _ Rachel_!--my wife -- my former -- precious -- wife . I thought she was in Canada . No doubt she thought the same of me . But I 've stumbled upon her quite by chance -- living close to the place where I had taken lodgings for Anita and the babe , in September , in case there were more raids this winter . What do you think of that ? "
53119	53128	53130	53131	Lady Winton	221	" It does n't interest me at all , "
53134	53297	53298	53298	He	2083	" Then you have no dramatic sense , my dear . Just think ! I stroll out , for want of anything better to do , with Anita , into the market - place of a beastly little country town , to see a silly sort of show -- a mixture of a Harvest Festival and a Land Girls ' beano -- when without a moment 's warning -- standing up in a decorated wagon -- I behold--_Rachel_!--handsomer than ever!--in a kind of khaki dress -- tunic , breeches , and leggings -- enormously becoming!--and , of course , the observed of all observers . More than that!--I perceive a young man , in an American uniform , dancing attendance upon her -- taking her orders -- walking her off to church -- Oh , a perfectly clear case!--no doubt about it at all . And there I stood -- within a few yards of her -- and she never saw me ! "
53328	53338	53318	53318	Her	1186	" Are you sure she did n't see you ? "
53339	53376	53377	53377	He	2083	" Sure . I put the child on my shoulder , and hid behind her . Besides -- my dear -- even Rachel might find it difficult to recognize her discarded husband -- in this individual ! "
53430	53438	53419	53419	she	221	" Have you seen that doctor again ? "
53439	53479	53419	53419	she	221	" To whom you so obligingly sent me ? Yes , I saw him yesterday . One lung seems to have finally struck work--_caput _ ! as the Germans say . The other will last a bit longer yet . "
53505	53511	53512	53512	he	2083	" Do n't be alarmed , "
53525	53545	53518	53518	he	2083	" I 'm drenched in disinfectant . I take all proper precautions -- for the child 's sake . Now then"--he
53552	53561	53562	53562	His	2083	feet--"what are you going to do for me ? "
53605	53626	53627	53627	she	1186	" I have saved twenty pounds for you -- out of my own money -- with _ great _ difficulty , "
53634	53683	53627	53627	she	1186	" If I were to tell Richard , he would be furious . And I cannot -- do--_anything_--more for you , beyond the allowance I give you . Everything you suffer from , you have brought upon , yourself . It is hopeless to try and help you . "
53687	53697	53698	53698	he	2083	" Well , then , I must try Rachel ! "
53709	53719	53721	53722	Lady Winton	221	" That I think would be the lowest depth ! "
53727	53738	53721	53722	Lady Winton	221	" to beg money from the wife who divorced you ! "
53739	53823	53824	53825	Lady Winton	221	" I am ready to beg for money -- requisition is the better word -- from anybody in the world who has more of it than I. I am a Bolshevist . You need n't talk to me about property , or rights . I do n't acknowledge them . I want something that you 've got , and I have n't . I shall take it if I find the opportunity -- civilly if I can , uncivilly , if I must . "
53873	53905	53844	53844	He	2087	" Handsome chap ! You 're in luck , Marianne . I suppose you managed to get him into a staff job of some sort , out of harm 's way ? "
54101	54110	54111	54111	he	1111	" Well , good - night , Edith , "
54121	54163	54111	54111	he	1111	" This 'll last for a bit -- but not very long , I warn you -- prices being what they are . Oh , by the way , my name just now is Wilson -- make a note of it ! "
54164	54170	54171	54171	she	221	" What 's that for ? "
54175	54214	54215	54215	He	1111	" Some Canadian creditors of mine got wind of me -- worse luck . I had to change my quarters , and drop the old name -- for a bit . However -- what 's in a name ? "
54224	54246	54221	54221	his	1111	" Going to shake hands , Edie ? You used to be awfully fond of me , when you were small . "
54268	54281	54286	54286	him	1111	" Good - night , Roger . Nannie will show you out . "
54504	54558	54497	54497	He	1111	" There must have been a black drop somewhere in our forbears , Edie . It has reappeared in me . We are none of us responsible , my dear , for our precious selves . I may be a sinner and a loafer -- but that benevolent Almighty of yours made me . "

55176	55188	55163	55165	The little thing	2131	" I 'm going to get a bus at the Circus . "
55189	55199	55200	55200	She	2128	" All right . I 'll see you there . "
55273	55349	55256	55256	she	2128	" Jolly good pay , though , compared to what it used to be ! Why , with tips , on a good day , I can make seven and eight shillings . That 's good , ai n't it ? And now the war 's goin' to stop . Do you think I want it to stop ? I do n't think ! Me and my sister'll be starvin ' again , I suppose ? "
55387	55395	55396	55396	she	2128	" What did you want with it ? "
55404	55422	55396	55396	she	2128	" I 'm straight , I am . There 's my bus ! Night ! night!--So long ! "

57392	57409	57411	57413	the young soldier	2232	" Oh , well , that 's straight ahead . I turn off to the right , "

57497	57506	57477	57477	Delane	179	" No -- only to Great End Farm . "
57517	57524	57569	57569	He	598	" You know some one there ? "
57525	57556	57577	57577	Dempsey	194	" No , but I want to see one of the ladies about something . There 's two of them running the farm . But Miss Henderson 's the boss . "
57629	57686	57623	57624	Presently Dempsey	234	" There 's been people in Ipscombe all these years as always would have it old Watson walked . I know the names of three people at least as have sworn to seein ' ' i m. And there 's an old fellow in Ipscombe now that declares he 's seen him , only t'ther day . "
57707	57725	57726	57727	The speaker	294	" He 's an old fool ! Did you ever hear of a ghost bleedin ' before ! "
57735	57816	57730	57730	his	294	" That 's all rot ! Besides , I do n't believe in ghosts -- never did . But as Miss Henderson 's farmin ' the very land where old Watson was done in , I thought she 'd like to have the true story and first hand . And there 's no one but me knows it -- not first hand . So I wrote to her , and said as I would call at six o'clock this evening . "
57817	57822	57730	57730	his	294	" You know her ? "
57823	57828	57830	57832	the young man	598	" No -- o , "
57836	57849	57830	57832	the young man	598	" But I somehow fancy as I may have seen her before . "
57850	57853	57730	57730	his	294	" Where ? "
57854	57870	57830	57832	the young man	598	" Why , in Canada . I was living on a farm , not far from Winnipeg"--he
57888	57892	57893	57893	he	598	" All right , "
57896	57900	57893	57893	he	598	" go on . "
57901	58029	57730	57730	his	294	" And there was a man -- a sort of gentleman -- his name was Delane -- on another farm about ten miles from where I was working . People talked of him no end -- he was a precious bad lot ! I never saw him that I know of -- but I saw his wife twice . They say he was a brute to her . And she was awfully handsome . You could n't forget her when you 'd once come across her . And when I saw Miss Henderson drivin ' one of the wagons in the Millsborough Harvest Festival , a fortnight ago , I could have sworn it was Mrs. Delane . But , of course , it was my mistake . "
58030	58038	57893	57893	he	598	" Where did you see Mrs. Delane ? "
58039	58073	57730	57730	his	294	" Once at her own place . I was delivering some poultry food that Delane had bought of my employer -- and once at a place belongin ' to a man called Tanner . "
58074	58077	57893	57893	he	598	" Tanner ? "
58078	58185	57730	57730	his	294	" Tanner . He was somethin' the same sort as Delane . We 've a lot of them in Canada -- remittance men , we call them -- men as ca n't get on in the old country -- and their relations pay 'em to go -- and pay 'em to keep away . But Tanner was a nice sort of fellow -- quite different from Delane . He painted pictures . I remember his showin ' some o ' them in Winnipeg . But he was always down on his luck . He could n't make any money , and he could n't keep it . "
58186	58193	57893	57893	he	598	" You saw Miss Henderson there ? "
58199	58385	58194	58194	Dempsey	194	" Oh , Lor , no ! I do n't say that . Why , I 'd get into trouble -- shouldn't I ? But I saw Mrs. Delane . I was driving past Tanner 's place , with two horses , and a heavy load , November two years ago -- just before we passed our Military Service Act , and I joined up . And an awful storm came on -- a regular blizzard . Before I got to Tanner 's I was nearly wore out , an ' the horses , too . So I stopped to ask for a hot drink or somethin' . You could n't see the horses ' heads for the snow . And Tanner brought me out some hot coffee -- I'm a teetotaller , you see -- an ' a woman stood at the door , and handed it to him . She was holdin ' a lamp , so I saw her quite plain . And I knew her at once , though she was only there a minute . It was Mrs. Roger Delane . "
58475	58484	58471	58471	he	2247	" And what was Mrs. Delane doing there ? "
58488	58575	58485	58485	Dempsey	194	" How should I know ? Tanner used to have a sister staying with him sometimes . Perhaps she and Mrs. Delane were friends . But I saw that woman quite plain . It was Mrs. Delane -- that I 'll swear . And Miss Henderson is as like her as two peas . It might have been her sister . Miss Henderson 's very uncommon - looking . You do n't often see that complexion and that hair . And she has lived in Canada . "
58576	58582	58485	58485	Dempsey	194	" How do you know ? "
58583	58626	58485	58485	Dempsey	194	" She told old Halsey . Well , there 's my road , just ahead . And if you 're going to Moor End , you keep straight on . The moon 's coming up . It wo n't be very dark . "
59147	59149	59152	59152	she	129	" fears "
59885	59936	59874	59874	He	235	" It 's some one as knows the story , and is playin ' the fool with it . It 's a very impudent thing to do ! It 's not playing fair , that 's what it is n't ; and I 'd like to get hold of him . "
60007	60020	60021	60021	he	598	" Well , I 'm sorry not to have seen Miss Henderson , "
60029	60055	60021	60021	he	598	" I 'd like to have had a talk with her about Canada . It was old Halsey told me she 'd lived in Canada . "
60056	60059	60061	60061	Janet	131	" Yes , "
60078	60096	60073	60073	he	235	" I wonder if Miss Henderson ever knew a man called Tanner -- who lived near Winnipeg ? "
60097	60106	60073	60073	he	235	" I never heard her speak of him . "
60107	60108	60073	60073	he	235	" Because"--he
60110	60132	60073	60073	he	235	twirled--"when I saw Miss Henderson at Millsborough that day of the rally , I thought as I 'd seen her before . "
60133	60136	60138	60138	Janet	131	" Oh ? "
60150	60189	60073	60073	he	235	" Dick Tanner , they called him , was a man -- an artist chap -- who lived not far from the man I was with -- and I once saw a lady there just like Miss Henderson . "
60190	60194	60073	60073	he	235	" Did you ? "
60199	60240	60195	60195	Dempsey	235	" Only it could n't have been Miss Henderson , you see -- because this lady I saw was a Mrs. Delane . But was Mrs. Delane perhaps a relation of Miss Henderson ? She was just like Miss Henderson . "
60241	60248	60250	60250	Janet	131	" I 'll ask Miss Henderson , "
60267	60280	60250	60250	Janet	131	" But I expect you 're confusing her with some one else . "
60409	60415	60430	60430	he	235	" November before they Passed Conscription "
60686	60692	60694	60694	Ellesborough	149	" Do n't believe her ! "
60700	60708	60694	60694	Ellesborough	149	" She is not a truthful woman ! "
60766	60788	60751	60751	she	129	" But it 's hopeless to go shopping with a man ! He ca n't make up his mind one bit ! "
60789	60799	60801	60801	Ellesborough	149	" He had n't a mind to make up ! "
60822	60856	60819	60819	She	129	" That , I suppose , was what made him want to buy the whole place ! If I 'd taken his advice , Janet , I should have been just cleaned out ! "
60857	60873	60875	60875	Ellesborough	149	" What 's the good of being economical when one 's going to be married ! "
60879	60881	60875	60875	Ellesborough	149	" Why-- "
60893	60922	60882	60882	Rachel	129	" And we 've settled our plans , Janet -- that is , if you 're agreeable . Will you mind looking after the farm for six months ? "
60923	60941	60943	60943	Ellesborough	149	" You see , if the armistice is signed -- and we shall know to - morrow , "
60945	60983	60943	60943	Ellesborough	149	" I shall be free in a month or so , and then we propose to marry and get a passage before Christmas . I must go home , and she says she 'll come with me ! "
61010	61043	61006	61006	Ellesborough	149	" We ca n't settle things -- can we?--till we 've seen his people . We 've got to decide whether I 'll go to America , or he 'll come here . "
61044	61049	61006	61006	Ellesborough	149	" But we want to say"--Ellesborough
61053	61067	61006	61006	Ellesborough	149	Janet--"that first and foremost , we wish to do the best for you . "
61083	61098	61006	61006	Ellesborough	149	" Oh , that 'll be all right . Do n't bother about me . "
61099	61104	61106	61106	Rachel	129	" We shall bother ! "
61110	61128	61106	61106	Rachel	129	" but I 'll tell you all about it presently . He wo n't stay to supper . "
61159	61166	61151	61151	he	149	" How do you get back ? "
61167	61187	61209	61209	she	131	" Oh , I left my bike in the village . I shall walk and pick it up there . "
61342	61356	61420	61420	she	131	" Will you write a little line to my mother to - morrow ? "
61357	61364	61420	61420	she	131	" Yes , of course . But-- "
61371	61390	61365	61365	He	149	" I have prepared the way , darling . I promise you -- it will be all right . "
61391	61403	61420	61420	she	131	" But why -- why -- didn't I see you first ? "
61425	61448	61420	61420	she	131	" It 's no good talking -- it ca n't ever be the same -- to you , or to your people . "
61449	61498	61420	61420	she	131	" It shall be the same ! Or rather , we shall owe you a double share of love to make up to you -- for that horrible time . Forget it , dear -- make yourself forget it . My mother would tell you so at once . "
61499	61509	61420	61420	she	131	" Is n't she -- very strict about divorce ? "
61517	61539	61420	61420	she	131	" She could n't have any doubts about your case -- dearest -- who could ? You fell among thieves , and-- "

62844	62849	62850	62850	she	131	" To - morrow ! "

63102	63109	63111	63111	Rachel	129	" Do n't stay , Hastings , "
63113	63123	63111	63111	Rachel	129	" I 'll get the horse and cart myself . "
63148	63160	63162	63162	Hastings	127	" Oh , I 've no call to go , Miss , "
63164	63174	63162	63162	Hastings	127	" I 'd rather stay and look after things . "
63348	63356	63357	63357	she	129	" Do n't wait tea for me , "
63362	63369	63357	63357	she	129	" I shall get some somewhere . "
63394	63402	63382	63382	Janet	131	" Ca n't you let it alone ? "
63436	63444	63430	63430	Janet	131	" Ca n't you let it alone ? "
63796	63802	63789	63789	She	131	" an insubstantial faery place , "
63864	63873	63861	63861	Rachel	129	" What are you doing ? Let go ! "
63902	63916	63901	63901	Rachel,--	237	" Sit where you are -- hold tight!--don't be a fool!--he'll quiet down . "
63949	63957	63958	63958	he	3155	" Well -- do you know me ? "
63971	63981	63936	63937	a man	3155	" Let those reins alone!--what are you doing here ? "
64011	64074	63993	63993	he	3155	" You know you never were strong enough to get the better of me . Why do you try ? Do n't be an idiot . I want to make an appointment with you . You ca n't escape me . I 've watched you for weeks . And see you alone , too . Without that fellow you 're engaged to . "
64086	64094	64095	64095	she	129	" He 'll take care of that , "
64098	64115	64095	64095	she	129	" and the police . I 'm not helpless now -- as I used to be . "
64116	64179	64180	64180	He	2426	" Ah , but you 'd better see me . I 've got a great deal to say that concerns you . I suppose you 've told that American chap a very pretty story about our divorce ? Well , it took me a long time to get to the bottom of it myself . But now I'm -- well , disillusioned ! "
64219	64242	64243	64243	he	2426	" Who stayed the night alone , with Dick Tanner , on his place , when I was safely got rid of ? "
64253	64264	64243	64243	he	2426	" And then who played the innocent -- who did ? "
64265	64268	64180	64180	He	2426	" Liar ! "
64269	64357	64243	64243	he	2426	" Not at all . I 've got some new evidence now -- some quite fresh light on the scene -- which may be useful to me . I want money . You seem to have a lot . And I want to be paid back a little of what I 'm owed . Oh , I can hold my tongue , if it 's made worth my while . I do n't suppose you 've told your American young man anything about Dick Tanner -- eh ? "
64358	64364	64365	64365	she	2428	" Let go the horse ! "
64375	64386	64365	64365	she	2428	" You 've nothing to do with me any more . "
64387	64447	64243	64243	he	2426	" Have n't I ? Oh , by all means tell your Yankee that I 've waylaid you . I should n't at all object to an interview with him . In fact , I rather think of asking for it . But if you want to prevent it , you 've got to do what you 're told . "
64458	64479	64448	64448	He	2429	" You 've got to arrange a time -- when I can see you--_alone ? _ When shall it be ? "
64503	64538	64494	64494	Delane	179	" This is Monday . Wednesday night -- get rid of everybody ! You can do it if you like . I shall come at nine . You 've got to let me in . "
64549	64554	64555	64555	he	2429	" Do n't forget , "
64561	64566	64555	64555	he	2429	" Good - night ! "
64644	64647	64649	64650	a man	3155	" Hallo ! "
64654	64659	64649	64650	a man	3155	" What the matter ? "
64747	64778	64745	64745	himself	3153	" Do n't be frightened , Mrs. Delane ! Why , you 've had a faint . But never mind . Cheer up ! I 'll get you home safe . "
64819	64825	64826	64826	she	129	" What did you say ? "
64853	64862	64839	64839	she	129	" Thank you , I 'm all right . "
64878	64935	64936	64936	lad	2442	" I beg your pardon , ma'am -- but I think I 've seen you in Canada . Did n't I once come to your place , with a parcel from Mr. Grimes -- that was my employer -- of Redminster ? I remember you had a Jap servant . And there was another time , I think"--the
64949	65003	64936	64936	lad	2442	curiosity--"when you and Mr. Dick Tanner gave me that fizzling hot coffee -- don't you remember?--in that awful blizzard two years ago ? And Mr. Tanner gave the horses a feed , too . Awfully good chap , Mr. Tanner . I do n't know what I should have done without that coffee . "
65030	65036	65037	65037	she	129	" You 're quite mistaken , "
65041	65082	65037	65037	she	129	" I never saw you before that I am aware of . Please let go the reins . I can manage now quite well . I do n't know what made me feel ill . I 'm all right now . "
65083	65096	65098	65098	Dempsey	194	" You 've got the reins twisted round the shaft , miss , "
65101	65111	65098	65098	Dempsey	194	" You 'd better let me put 'em right . "
65304	65310	65311	65311	she	2444	" What is your name ? "
65338	65345	65332	65332	she	2444	" Quiet , Jack , quiet ! "
65346	65355	65356	65356	He	3771	" My name 's John Dempsey , ma'am . "
65393	65398	65399	65399	she	2444	" It 's curious , "
65402	65435	65399	65399	she	2444	" but you 're not the first person who 's mistaken me for that Mrs. Delane . I knew something about her . I do n't want to be mistaken for her . "
65436	65440	65442	65442	Dempsey	194	" I see , "
65444	65482	65399	65399	she	2444	" I would rather you did n't speak about it in the village -- or anywhere . You see , one does n't like to be confused with some people . I did n't like Mrs. Delane . "
65489	65498	65483	65484	The lad	2453	" She got divorced , did n't she ? "
65499	65527	65543	65543	him	194	" I dare say . I knew very little about her . But , as I said , I do n't want to be mistaken for her . "
65561	65641	65545	65545	His	194	" And I should be very much obliged to you if you would keep what you thought about me to yourself . I do n't want you to talk about it in the village or anywhere . Come up and see me -- at the farm -- and I 'll tell you why I dislike being mixed up with that woman -- why , in fact , I should mind it dreadfully . I ca n't explain now , but-- "
65739	65759	65693	65694	Captain Ellesborough	149	" Why , of course , ma'am , wo n't say anything . I did n't mean any harm . "
65760	65764	65766	65766	Rachel	129	" All right , "
65774	65801	65766	65766	Rachel	129	" If you like to come up to - morrow morning , I shall be pleased to see you . It 's a bargain , mind ! "
65816	65825	65831	65831	himself	194	" Well , that 's the rummiest go ! "
65840	65874	65829	65829	Dempsey	194	" Mistake be damned ! She _ was _ Mrs. Delane , and what 's she up to now with my captain ? And what the deuce was she doing at Tanner 's ? "

66119	66133	66134	66134	he	2476	" Well , I suppose there were fine doings at Millsborough , Miss , "
66148	66163	66138	66138	he	2476	" Yes -- there were a lot of people . It was very noisy . "
66164	66210	66245	66245	he	2476	" We thought you 'd hear our noise , Miss , as far as the road ! Miss Leighton , she 's been keeping us all alive . She took the girls to church -- to the Thanksgiving Service , while I looked after things . "
66211	66217	66219	66220	Miss Henderson	127	" All right , Hastings , "
66231	66241	66219	66220	Miss Henderson	127	" Thank you . Will you take the cart ? "
66251	66267	66245	66245	he	2476	" She 's been overdoin ' it again . The Cap'n will tell her so . "
66315	66321	66309	66309	Janet	131	" Come and join in ! "
66327	66331	66309	66309	Janet	131	" God Save the King"--a

66525	66562	66519	66519	She	129	" I went to find Lucy Tanner , who was my friend -- she was n't there -- I was overtaken by the storm -- and Dick Tanner looked after me till I could get home . "

67570	67581	67557	67557	he	194	" Would n't you like to know , Miss Inquisitive ? "

67713	67717	67708	67708	He	194	" real smart . "
67723	67730	67708	67708	He	194	" Jenny thought was to be happy .
67928	67937	67938	67938	she	129	" So my cow 's a good one ? "
67948	67952	67954	67954	Rachel	129	" A beauty , "
67979	67998	67999	67999	she	131	" It does n't seem to be quite as easy to tell lies about cows as about horses , "
68004	68020	67999	67999	she	131	" that 's about all one can say . We 'll hope for the best . "
68026	68121	67999	67999	she	131	" I never told you much about that man Dempsey 's visit . Of course he came to see you . He thought when he saw you at Millsborough that you were a Mrs. Delane he had seen in Canada . Were you perhaps a relation of hers ? I said I would ask you . Then I inquired how often he had seen Mrs. Delane . He said twice -- perhaps three times -- at her home -- at a railway station -- and at a farm belonging to a man called Tanner . "
68122	68125	68127	68127	Rachel	129	" Yes , "
68131	68152	68127	68127	Rachel	129	" I knew Lucy Tanner , his sister . She was an artist like him . I liked them both . "
68263	68300	68252	68252	she	129	" I 'm going over to - morrow to a little service -- a Thanksgiving service -- at Millsborough . I took the girls to church to - day -- but I love my own people ! "
68307	68314	68252	68252	she	129	" Unitarian service , you mean ? "
68315	68366	68252	68252	she	129	" Yes -- we've got a little 'cause ' there , and a minister . The service will be about six , I think . The girls will manage . The minister and his wife want me to stay to supper -- but I shall be back in good time . "
68367	68371	68252	68252	she	129	" About ten ? "
68372	68385	68252	68252	she	129	" Oh , yes -- quite by then . I shall bicycle . "
68552	68571	68572	68572	she	129	" You seem to have saved me and my horse from a tumble into that ditch last night , "
68584	68618	68572	68572	she	129	" Why I turned faint like that I ca n't imagine . I do sometimes when I 'm tired . Well , now then -- let us walk up the road a little . "
68676	68683	68685	68686	Miss Henderson	127	" I wanted to tell you , "
68687	68794	68795	68796	The speaker	294	calmly--"because I 'm sure you 're a nice fellow , and do n't want to hurt anybody 's feelings -- why I asked you to hold your tongue about Mrs. Delane . In the first place , you 're quite mistaken about myself . I was never at Mr. Tanner 's farm -- never in that part of Canada ; and the person you saw there -- Mrs. Delane -- was a very favourite cousin of mine , and extraordinarily like me . When we were children everybody talked of the likeness . She had a very sad story , and now -- she 's dead . "
68801	68869	68795	68796	The speaker	294	" I 've been confused with her before -- and it 's a great trouble to me . The confusion has done me harm , more than once , and I 'm very sensitive about it . So , as I said last night , I should be greatly obliged if you would not only not spread the story , but deny it , whenever you can . "
68881	68885	68886	68886	he	294	" Of course , "
68889	68899	68886	68886	he	294	" I should like to do anything you wish . "
68900	68907	68908	68908	she	2525	" I do wish it , and-- "
68916	68970	68908	68908	she	2525	think--"and Captain Ellesborough wishes it . I would not advise you , however , to say anything at all about it to him . But if you do what we ask you , you may be sure we shall find some way -- some substantial way -- of showing that we appreciate it . "
68999	69013	69014	69014	she	2525	" What do you want to do , now the war 's over ? "
69026	69046	68984	68984	she	2525	" I suppose I want to settle down -- somewhere -- on land , if I had the money . "
69047	69052	68984	68984	she	2525	" Here?--or in Canada ? "
69053	69059	68984	68984	she	2525	" Oh , at home . "
69060	69091	68984	68984	she	2525	" I thought so . Well , Mr. Dempsey , Captain Ellesborough and I shall be quite ready to help you in any scheme you take up . You understand ? "
69092	69101	68984	68984	she	2525	" That 's awfully kind of you -- but-- "
69102	69106	69107	69107	she	2525	" Quite ready , "
69110	69134	69107	69107	she	2525	" Let me know what your plans are when you 've worked them out -- and I 'll see what can be done . "
69166	69170	69171	69171	she	2525	" You understand ? "
69174	69182	69136	69136	she	2525	" Oh , yes -- I understand . "
69183	69188	69189	69189	she	2525	" And you agree ? "
69196	69207	69136	69136	she	2525	" Oh , yes , I -- I -- agree . "
69208	69244	69136	69136	she	2525	" Well , then , that 's all right -- that 's understood . A letter will always find me here . And now I must get back to my work . Good - morning . "
69492	69497	69501	69502	The vicar	3228	" folly even to wish "
69933	69944	69946	69947	the vicar	3228	" Have n't we a tiresome meeting to - night ? "
69974	69984	69954	69954	he	3228	" Yes -- Miss Hall is coming to speak . "
70071	70086	70025	70025	she	248	" How can she know aught about it -- havin' none of her own ? "
70185	70211	70170	70172	a wise woman	2580	" Do you think you could possibly take a note for me to Miss Leighton this morning -- when you go to see old Frant ? "
70212	70215	70217	70223	a labourer on the point of death	2581	" Old Frant "
70237	70248	70231	70231	He	3228	" Great End 's hardly in old Frant 's direction . "
70261	70323	70231	70231	He	3228	" It wo n't take you far out of your way . I want Miss Leighton to send those two girls to the Armistice dance to - night if they 'd like to come . Lady Alicia writes that several of her maids are down with the flu , and she asks me to give away two or three more tickets . "
70324	70361	70363	70364	the vicar	3228	" Why does n't Lady Alicia let the servants manage the thing themselves when she gives them a party ? _ They _ ought to invite . I would n't be bossed if I were they , "
70369	70379	70231	70231	He	3228	" She 's so particular about character , dear . "
70380	70398	70422	70423	Miss Shenstone	139	" So would they be . She has n't been so very successful in her own case . "
70427	70436	70422	70423	Miss Shenstone	139	" I 'll have the note ready directly . "
70482	70485	70486	70488	A fine fellow	2587	" rally . "
70620	70629	70600	70600	his	3228	" I wish I had guessed it sooner . "
70633	70642	70600	70600	his	3228	perhaps--"Why did you make a fool of me ? "
70666	70673	70653	70653	Rachel	129	" Wo n't you come in ? "
70674	70686	70688	70689	the vicar	3228	" Oh , no , I must n't waste your time , "
70694	70704	70688	70689	the vicar	3228	" Perhaps you 'll give me a verbal answer . "
70740	70776	70711	70712	the vicar	3228	" Very kind of Lady Alicia . Of course the girls shall come . They will be delighted . You really wo n't come in ? Then I 'll walk to the road with you . "
70831	70835	70828	70828	her	131	" done up . "
71183	71206	71169	71169	she	129	" Girls!--would you like to go to the Shepherds ' dance to - night ? I 've got an invitation for you ? "
71469	71480	71482	71482	Jenny	131	" Ai n't she just kind?--don't you just love her ? "
72279	72284	72267	72267	She	129	" Come in here . "
72301	72309	72310	72310	he	253	" You 've managed it uncommonly well , "
72316	72329	72310	72310	he	253	" You 've dared it . Are n't you afraid of me ? "
72330	72340	72341	72341	They	2649	" Not the least . What do you want ? "
72658	72664	72665	72665	he	253	" What do I want ? "
72676	72714	72673	72673	his	253	" I 'll tell you . I 've come -- like Foch -- to dictate to you certain terms , which you have only to accept . We had better sit down . It will take time . "
72758	72780	72753	72753	He	253	" I confess you were very clever about Dick Tanner -- and I was a precious fool ! I never suspected . "
72781	72792	72753	72753	He	253	" I have not the least idea what you mean . "
72793	72797	72798	72798	he	253	" A lie ! "
72803	72927	72798	72798	he	253	" You were in Dick Tanner 's house -- staying with him alone -- at night -- after I left you . You were seen there -- by a man -- a Canadian -- from whom I had the story -- only two days ago . He does n't know my name , nor I his . We met on the common , two nights ago , after dark . And by the merest chance he was coming to the farm , and he began to talk of you . Then this came out . But of course I always knew that it -- or something like it -- would come out . Your puritanical airs never deceived me -- for a moment . "
72928	72938	72942	72942	her	2655	" I suppose you are talking of John Dempsey ? "
72947	73002	73003	73003	She	2655	" I know nothing about John Dempsey . Of course I can track the man who told me , if I want to -- with the greatest ease . He was coming here to call . He saw either you or your partner . And I shall track him -- if you force me . "
73011	73059	73008	73008	he	2656	" Assume , please , that I have my witness at hand . Well , then , he saw you alone -- at night -- in Dick Tanner 's charge , a few days apparently , after you and I quarrelled . What were you doing there ? "
73060	73071	73072	73072	she	2655	" It was during that great snowstorm , I suppose , "
73086	73121	73072	73072	she	2655	" I remember going over to the Tanners ' to ask for something -- and being snow - bound . Lucy Tanner was always ready to help me -- and be sorry for me . "
73137	73239	73072	73072	she	2655	" Lucy Tanner ? Yes , that 's good . I thought you 'd play her ! Now , I 'll tell you something . The day after I left you , I was on the train going to Regina . We stopped a long time . I do n't remember why -- at Medicine Hat -- and walking up and down the platform was--_Lucy Tanner _ ! Does that surprise you ? She told me she could n't stand the Manitoba climate , and was going to a friend at Kamloops for the winter . Is that news to you ? "
73254	73291	73072	73072	she	2655	" Not at all . Naturally , I went over expecting to find her . But as you say , she was gone , and Mr. Tanner drove me back , when the storm went down . "
73302	73463	73293	73293	she	129	" What 's the use of talking like this , Roger ? You wo n't make anything out of this story you 're so proud of . Had n't you better come to business ? Why have you been spying on me , and dogging me like this ? You know , of course , I could give you in charge to - morrow , or I could get Captain Ellesborough to do it . And I will -- unless you give me your solemn promise to leave this place , to go out of my life altogether , and stop molesting me in this scandalous way . Now , of course , I understand who it is that has been prowling about the farm all these weeks . And I warn you the police too know all about it , and are on the watch . They may have tracked you here to - night for all I know . "
73464	73531	73532	73532	He	2659	" Not they ! I passed one bobby fellow on the hill , going safely away north , as I came down . I was scarcely three yards from him , and he never twigged . And the other 's gone to Millsborough . You could hardly be more alone , more entirely at my mercy -- than you are at this moment , Miss Henderson ! "
73546	73582	73541	73541	She	2660	" All the same the people who live with me in this house will soon be back . I recommend you to make haste . I ask you again -- what is it you want ? "
73631	73639	73640	73640	he	2659	" Well , I 'll tell you , "
73684	73841	73644	73644	He	2659	" I went this morning in town to look up your uncle 's will . Of course I remember all about that old chap at Manchester . I often speculated on what he was going to leave you . Unfortunately for me he lived just a little too long . But I find from the copy of the will that he left you -- three -- thousand -- pounds . Not bad , considering that you were never at all civil to him . But three thousand pounds is more than you require to run this small farm on . You owe me damages for the injury you inflicted on me by the loss of -- first , your society ; second , your financial prospects . I assess it at five hundred pounds . Pay me that small sum , and -- well , I engage to leave you henceforth to the Captain,--and your conscience . "
73866	73872	73864	73864	she	2662	" And if I refuse ? "
73873	73879	73880	73880	he	2661	" Oh , well , then-- "
73894	73950	73880	73880	he	2661	considering--"I shall of course have to work up my case . What do you call this man?--John Dempsey ? A great fool -- but I dare say I shall get enough out of him . And then -- well , then I propose to present the story to Captain Ellesborough -- for his future protection . "
73951	73961	73880	73880	he	2661	" He wo n't believe a word of it . "
73989	74017	73880	73880	he	2661	" I dare say not . That 's for him to consider . But if I were you , I would n't put him to the test . "
74045	74093	74036	74036	he	2661	" Rachel!--when did you begin to prefer Dick Tanner to me ? No doubt you had a jolly time with him . I suppose I ca n't undo the divorce -- but you would never have got it , if I had n't been such an innocent . "
74108	74132	74133	74133	she	2662	" If you say any more such things to me , you will get nothing from me -- and you may either _ go_-- "
74138	74153	74094	74094	She	2662	door--"or you may sit there till my people come back -- which you like . "
74180	74220	74221	74221	She	2662	" You are just the same spitfire , I see , as you used to be ! All right . I see you understand . Well , now , how am I to get my money -- my damages ? "
74403	74414	74415	74415	she	2662	" Shall I -- shall I get you some brandy ? "
74486	74492	74472	74472	he	2661	" That 's your doing ! "
74500	74504	74505	74505	he	2661	" It is , "
74512	74560	74505	74505	he	2661	" You never showed me any real love -- any forbearance . You never cared for me -- as you know I cared for you . You told me so once . You married me for a home -- and then you deserted -- and betrayed me . "
74576	74633	74662	74662	he	2669	" I know my own faults very well . And now you must go -- we ca n't either of us stand this any more . Do you give me your solemn promise that you will trouble me no more --- or the man I am going to marry -- if I do this for you ? "
74634	74641	74642	74642	he	2669	" Give me a piece of paper-- "
74668	74671	74662	74662	he	2669	" to bearer "
74677	74732	74662	74662	he	2669	" Well , I dare say that will see me out -- and bury me decently . I shall take my family down to the sea . You know I 've got a little girl -- about three ? Oh , I never told any lies about Anita . I 've married her now . "
74826	74831	74821	74821	he	2669	" Let me be ! "
74861	74868	74873	74873	he	2669	" Well , good - night . "
74883	74928	74873	74873	he	2669	" Good - night . Anita will be kind to me -- when I die -- Anita will be a woman to me . You were never kind -- you never thought of any one but yourself . Good - bye . Good luck ! "

80924	80937	80908	80908	he	2892	" Not that I know of . Come and have your tea . "

81179	81226	81231	81231	her	129	" That I do n't know . But three or four months certainly . It will put off our wedding , dearest , a bit . But you 'd like me to go , would n't you ? I should be at the hub of things . "
81234	81241	81231	81231	her	129	" _ Must you go _ ? "

81418	81439	81441	81441	she	129	" I told you -- I ca n't always help it . I 'm a fool , I suppose -- but-- "
81454	81481	81441	81441	she	129	" You 'll have time to think -- when you 're away from me -- that it was a great pity -- you ever asked me . "
82205	82212	82203	82203	Rachel	129	thinking--"Why did n't _ he _ propose it?"--this
82296	82468	82293	82293	her	129	" My Darling -- What an idiot I was last night ! This morning I have woke up to a brilliant idea -- why I did n't propose it to you yesterday I ca n't imagine ! Let us marry before I go . Meet me in London , a week to - day , and let us go into the country , or to the sea , for a blessed forty - eight hours , afterwards . Then you will see me off -- and I shall know , wherever I go , that you are my very , very own , and I am yours . I do n't want to hurry you . Take time to think , and write to me to - night , or wire me to - morrow morning . But the very idea that you may say ' Yes ' makes me the happiest of men . Take time to think -- but -- all the same -- don't keep me too long waiting !
82469	82472	82293	82293	her	129	" Your own ,
82473	82475	82293	82293	her	129	" G.E. "
82491	82500	82501	82501	she	2923	" I 'll wire to - morrow morning , "
82768	82778	82765	82765	Rachel	129	" Janet , I want to speak to you . "
82838	82843	82825	82825	She	131	" Here , Rachel ? "
82844	82850	82825	82825	She	131	" You 've nearly done ? "
82851	82873	82825	82825	She	131	" In a few minutes . If you 'll go into the sitting - room , I 'll join you directly . "
82955	82960	82939	82939	Janet	131	" What is it ? "
82964	82984	82985	82985	She	131	" I told you one secret , Janet , the other day . Now this is another . And it's-- "
82996	83038	82985	82985	She	131	moment--"I did n't mean to tell you , or any one . I ca n't make up my mind whether I 'm bound to or not . But I want you to advise me , Janet . I 'm awfully troubled . "
83121	83130	83118	83119	a religious	2931	" Tell me -- I'll do my best . "
83131	83137	83139	83139	Rachel	129	" In the first place , "
83146	83155	83139	83139	Rachel	129	" who do you think was the ghost ? "
83156	83162	83118	83119	a religious	2931	" What do you mean ? "
83163	83171	83139	83139	Rachel	129	" The ghost -- was Roger Delane ! "
83211	83222	83118	83119	a religious	2931	" Oh , Rachel , have you ever seen him ? "
83223	83307	83118	83119	a religious	2931	" Twice . He stopped me on the road , when I was coming back from Millsborough on Armistice Day . And he came to see me the day after . You remember you were astonished to find I had sent the girls to the Shepherds ' dance ? I did it to get them out of the way -- and if you had n't said you were going to that service I should have had to invent something to send you away . "
83308	83317	83319	83319	Janet	131	" I always thought he was in Canada ? "
83324	83336	83319	83319	Janet	131	" What did he want ? Have you told Captain Ellesborough ? "
83337	83366	83118	83119	a religious	2931	" No , I have n't told George . I do n't know whether I shall . Roger wanted money -- as usual . I gave him some . "
83367	83377	83319	83319	Janet	131	" _ You gave him some ! Rachel ! _ "
83378	83410	83118	83119	a religious	2931	" I had to -- I had to buy him off . And I 've seen John Dempsey also without your knowing . And I 've had to bribe him too . "
83454	83457	83319	83319	Janet	131	" Dick Tanner "
83464	83475	83477	83477	Rachel	129	" I know you ca n't understand me , Janet , "
83483	83563	83477	83477	Rachel	129	" you could never do what I 've done . I dare say when you 've let me tell you the story you 'll not be able to forgive me . You 'll think I ought never to have let you settle with me -- that I told a lie when I said I was n't a bad woman -- that I 've disgraced you . I hope you wo n't . That -- that would about finish it . "
83818	83825	83827	83827	Rachel	129	" I did n't love him , "
83835	83924	83831	83831	her	129	eyes--"I do n't pretend I did . I liked him -- I was awfully sorry for him -- as he was for me . But -- well , there it is ! I went over to his house . I honestly thought his sister was there ; but , above all , I wanted him to sympathize with me -- and pity me -- because he knew everything . And she was n't there -- and I stayed three days and nights with him . _ Voil _ ! "
83943	84034	83939	83939	Rachel	129	" Now , why am I telling you all this ? I need never have told anybody -- at least up to a few days ago . Poor Dick was drowned just before I got my divorce , in a boat accident on Lake Nipissing . He had gone there to paint , and was camping out . If he had n't been drowned , perhaps , he would have made me marry him . So there was no one in the world who knew I was ever with him except-- "
84040	84127	84128	84128	She	129	" Except this man who turned up here in George 's own camp -- and in the village , two months ago , but whom I never saw till this week--_this week_--Armistice Day -- John Dempsey . That was a queer chance , was n't it ? The sort of thing nobody could have expected . I was coming back from Millsborough . I was -- well , just that evening , I was awfully happy . I expected nothing . And then -- within twenty minutes-- "
84180	84187	84188	84188	she	129	" Why did I do it ? "
84197	84364	84188	84188	she	129	" It was idiotic ! Why did n't I just accept the boy 's story , and say quietly , ' Yes , I was staying with the Tanners ' ? And why did n't I defy Roger -- go straight to George , and hand him over to the police ? Do n't you see why ? Because it is true!--_it 's true!_--and I 'm terrified . If I lost George , I should kill myself . I never thought I should be -- I could be -- in love with anybody like this . But yet I suppose it was in me all the time . I was always seeking -- reaching out -- to somebody I could love with every bit of me , soul and body -- somebody I could follow -- for I ca n't manage for myself -- I'm not like you , Janet . And now I 've found him -- and -- Do you know what that is ? "
84385	84468	84365	84365	She	2949	" It 's a letter from George . It came this morning . He wants me to marry him at once -- next week . He 's got some new work in France , and he saw that I was miserable because he was going away . And why should n't I ? _ Why should n't I ? _ I love him . There 's nothing wrong with me , except that wretched story . Well , there are two reasons . First"--she
84474	84640	84371	84371	her	2949	emphasis--"I do n't believe for a moment Roger will keep his word . I know him . He is frightfully ill . He says he 's dying . He may die -- before he 's got through this money . That would be the best thing that could happen to me -- wouldn't it ? But probably he wo n't die -- and certainly he 'll get through the money ! Then he 'll come back -- and I shall begin bribing him again -- and telling lies to hide it from George -- and in the end it 'll be no use -- for Roger 's quite reckless -- you ca n't appeal to him through anything but money . He 'll see George , whatever I do , and try it on with him . And then -- George will know how to deal with _ him _ , I dare say -- but when we are alone -- and he asks _ me_-- "
84660	84673	84653	84653	her	2950	" You see , Janet , do n't you ? You see ? "
84684	84691	84653	84653	her	2950	" You poor , poor thing ! "
84753	84766	84730	84730	She	131	" You 'll let me say just what I feel , Rachel ? "
84767	84771	84730	84730	She	131	" Of course . "
84772	84792	84730	84730	She	131	" You ca n't marry him without telling him . No , no -- you could n't do that ! "
84812	84821	84822	84822	Janet	131	" You could n't do that , Rachel , "
84834	84843	84827	84827	she	131	" you 'd never have a happy moment . "
84844	84852	84854	84854	Rachel	129	" Oh , yes , of course , "
84866	84915	84854	84854	Rachel	129	" One says that -- but how do you know ? I might never think of it again -- if Roger and that man Dempsey were out of the way . It 's dead -- it 's _ dead _ ! Why do we trouble about such things ! "
84916	84922	84924	84924	Janet	131	" It would be dead , "
84930	84942	84924	84924	Janet	131	" if you 'd told him -- and he 'd forgiven ! "
84943	84952	84954	84954	Rachel	129	" What has he to do with it ? "
84958	84972	84954	84954	Rachel	129	" it was before he knew me . I was a different being . "
84973	85035	84854	84854	Rachel	129	" No -- it is always the same self , which we are making , all the time . Do n't you see -- dear , dear Rachel!--it 's your chance now to put it all behind you -- just by being true . Oh , I do n't want to preach to you -- but I see it so clearly ! "
85036	85053	85055	85055	Rachel	129	" But it is n't as a man would see it -- a man like George , "
85061	85063	85058	85058	her	129	" Look there"--she
85074	85259	84854	84854	Rachel	129	table--"there are letters from his people which he brought me this morning . It 's awful!--how they take me at his valuation -- just because he loves me . I must be everything that 's good , because he says so . And you can see what kind of people they are -- what they think of him -- and what they imagine about me -- what they think I _ must _ be -- for him to love me . I do n't mean they 're prigs -- they are n't a bit . It 's just their life coming out , quite naturally . You see what they are -- quite simply -- what they ca n't help being , and what they expect from him and the woman he marries . And he 's got to take me home to them -- some time -- to present me to them . The divorce is difficult enough . Even if they think of me as quite innocent , it will be hard for them , that George should marry a divorced woman . "
85260	85269	85271	85271	Janet	131	" What have they to do with it ? "
85273	85298	85271	85271	Janet	131	" It 's only George that matters -- no other person has any right whatever to know ! You need n't consider anybody else . "
85299	85371	84854	84854	Rachel	129	" Yes -- but think of _ him _ . It 's bad enough that I should know something he does n't know -- but at least _ he 's _ spared . He can take me home to his mother -- whom he adores -- and if _ I _ know that I 'm a cheat and a sham -- he does n't --it will be all easy for him . "
85413	85423	85424	85424	Rachel	129	" And think of _ me _ , please ! "
85428	85461	85424	85424	Rachel	129	" If I tell him , it 's done -- for ever . He 'll forgive me , I think . He may be everything that 's dear , and good , and kind"--her
85463	85616	85617	85617	She	2952	broke--"but it 'd hit him dreadfully hard . A man like that ca n't forget such a thing . When I 've once said it , I shall have changed everything between us . He must think -- some time -- when he 's alone -- when I 'm not there--'It was Dick Tanner once -- it will be some one else another time ! ' I shall have been pulled down from the place where he puts me now -- even after he knows all about Roger and the divorce -- pulled down for good and all -- however much he may pity me -- however good he may be to me . It will be love perhaps -- but another kind of love . He ca n't trust me again . No one could . And it 's that I ca n't bear -- I ca n't _ bear _ ! "
85645	85653	85655	85655	Janet	131	" Yes -- that you could bear , "
85658	85685	85655	85655	Janet	131	" with him to help you -- and God . It would all straighten out in the end -- because the first step would be right . "
85691	85699	85700	85700	she	129	" Now that I 've told you , "
85703	85722	85700	85700	she	129	" can _ you _ ever think the same of me again ? You know you ca n't ! "
85739	85781	85723	85723	Janet	131	" Not the same -- no , not the same ! But if I cared for you before , Rachel -- I care for you ten thousand times more now . Do n't you see?--it will be the same with him ? "
85787	85797	85798	85798	she	129	" No -- a _ man 's _ different , "
85801	85807	85798	85798	she	129	" a man 's different ! "
85808	85816	85818	85818	Janet	131	" Anyway , you _ must _ , "
85821	85836	85818	85818	Janet	131	" you know you must . You do n't need me to tell you . "
85888	86001	85859	85859	Janet	131	" Dear Rachel , one goes on living side by side -- doing one 's daily work -- and thinking just one 's ordinary thoughts -- and all the time one never speaks of the biggest things of all -- the only things that matter , really . Is n't it God that matters -- and the law in our hearts ? If we break it -- if we are n't true -- if we wrong those that love us -- if we injure and deceive -- how will it be when we grow old -- when we come to die ? Whatever our gain -- we shall have lost our souls ? "
86002	86013	86015	86015	Rachel	129	" You think I should injure him by marrying him ? "
86017	86055	86173	86173	Janet	131	" No -- no ! A thousand times , no ! But by deceiving him -- by not trusting him -- with all your heart , and all your life -- that would be the worst injury . "
86056	86070	86072	86072	Rachel	129	" How do you know all there may have been in his life ? "
86074	86079	86072	86072	Rachel	129	vehemently--"I do n't ask . "
86080	86087	86173	86173	Janet	131	" I think you do know . "
86102	86111	86112	86112	she	129	" Well , I dare say I do ! "
86116	86129	86112	86112	she	129	" Of course he 's a hundred times too good for me . "
86130	86172	86173	86173	Janet	131	" Do n't turn it off like that ! It 's for oneself one has to think -- one 's own fulfilling of the law . Love--_is _ the fulfilling of the law . And love means trust -- and truth . "
86262	86284	86256	86256	she	129	" Very well . That 's settled . How shall it be done ? Shall I write it or say it ? "
86312	86316	86295	86295	she	131	" Write it . "
86317	86321	86327	86328	an automaton	2954	" All right . "
86330	86337	86295	86295	she	131	" How shall I send it ? "
86338	86350	86295	86295	she	131	" Would you -- would you trust me to take it ? "
86351	86360	86295	86295	she	131	" You mean -- you'd talk to him ? "
86361	86368	86295	86295	she	131	" If you gave me leave . "
86418	86429	86406	86406	Janet	131	" I should bicycle , and get home before dark . "
86430	86440	86442	86442	Rachel	129	" And now let 's talk of something else , "
86775	86780	86772	86772	She	131	" Who 's there ? "
87750	87762	87764	87765	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" Well , so Miss Henderson 's engaged to our Captain ! "
87777	87809	87764	87765	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" The girls here , and I , are awfully interested . The camp began it ! But do you want the Captain ? I 'm afraid he is n't here . "
87815	87830	87810	87810	Janet	131	" I thought I should be sure to find him in the dinner hour . "
87831	87859	87928	87929	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" No , he went up to town by the first train this morning on some business with the Ministry . We expect him back about three . "
87872	87879	87881	87882	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" You wanted to see him ? "
87888	87912	87928	87929	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" I brought a letter for him . If I leave it , will he be sure to get it directly he returns ? "
87913	87927	87928	87929	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" His servant 's in the hut . Let 's talk to him . "
87947	87963	87965	87965	Janet	131	" I have a letter for Captain Ellesborough -- an important letter -- on business , "
87967	87999	87965	87965	Janet	131	" I was to wait for an answer . But as he is n't here , where shall I leave it , so that he will be certain to get it ? "
88000	88011	88013	88014	the soldier	3007	" On his table , if you please , ma'am , "
88026	88033	88013	88014	the soldier	3007	room--"I'll see that he gets it . "
88034	88041	88043	88043	Janet	131	" It 'll be quite safe ? "
88059	88090	88013	88014	the soldier	3007	" Lor , yes , ma'am . Nobody comes in here but me , when the Captain 's away . I 'll tell him of it directly he comes home . "
88091	88109	88110	88111	The servant	3009	" May I just write a little note myself ? I expected to find Captain Ellesborough in . "
88120	88146	88110	88111	The servant	3009	wrote--"I brought Rachel 's letter , and am very disappointed not to see you . Come at once . Do n't delay . Janet Leighton . "
88173	88184	88186	88187	that lady	3011	" I am so sorry you did n't find him , "
88189	88197	88198	88198	she	3011	" Was it something about the wedding ? "
88212	88220	88222	88222	Janet	131	" Oh , no -- not yet , "
88226	88237	88239	88240	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" Well , I suppose it wo n't be long , "
88242	88252	88239	88240	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" He 's desperately in love , you know ! "
88276	88485	88259	88260	Mrs. Fergusson	143	" You see , we women who are doing all this new work with men , we know a jolly deal more about them than we ever did before . I can tell you , it searches us out , this joint life -- both women and men . In this camp you ca n't hide what you are -- the sort of man -- or the sort of woman . And there is n't a woman in this camp , if she 's been here any time , who would n't trust the Captain for all she 's worth -- who would n't tell him her love - affairs , or her debts -- or march up to a machine - gun , if he told her . In a sense , they 're in love with him , because -- as you 've no doubt found out , he has a way with him ! But they all know that he 's never been anything to them but the best of Commandants , and a good friend . Oh , I could never have run this camp but for him . He and I 'll go together ! Of course we 're shutting up very soon . "
88555	88561	88553	88554	A lover	1652	" not too bright and good "
88612	88618	88619	88619	she	129	" He was n't there ? "
88641	88650	88651	88651	she	131	" I would have waited if I could , "
88656	88672	88651	88651	she	131	" But it would have looked strange . Mrs. Fergusson would have suspected something wrong . "
88673	88683	88685	88685	Rachel	129	" Oh no , you could n't have waited , "
88689	88690	88692	88692	her	129	" Well!"--she
88698	88738	88739	88739	She	129	stretch--"it 's done . In half an hour he 'll be reading the letter . It 's like waiting for one 's execution , is n't it ? Nothing can stop it ; I may be dead before tea ! "
88745	88748	88651	88651	she	131	" Rachel ! "
88749	88795	88797	88797	her	129	" Well , that 's how I feel . If he gives me up , it will be death -- though I dare say I shall go on fussing round the farm , and people will still talk to me as if I were alive . But!"--she
88800	88807	88809	88809	Janet	131	" He wo n't give you up-- "
88812	88821	88809	88809	Janet	131	troubled--"because -- because he 's a good man . "
88822	88969	88970	88970	She	3022	" All the more reason . If I were he , I should give me up . Shall I tell you a queer thing , Janet ? I hate Roger , as much as I can hate anybody . It would be a great relief to me if I heard he were dead . And yet at the same time I see -- oh yes , I see quite plainly -- that I treated him badly . He told me so the other night -- and it is so -- it 's _ true _ . I never had the least patience with him . And now he 's dying -- at least he says so -- and though I hate him -- though I pray I may never , never see him again , yet I 'm sorry for him . Is n't that strange ? "
88992	89000	88970	88970	She	3022	" No , it is n't strange . "
89001	89008	88970	88970	She	3022	" Why not?--when I hate him ? "
89009	89025	89026	89026	Janet	131	" One can be sorry even for those one hates . I suppose God is , "
89041	89080	89033	89033	Rachel	129	" Why should God hate any one ? He made us . He 's responsible . He must have known what He was doing . If He really pitied us , would He have made us at all ? "
89093	89110	89111	89111	Rachel	129	" Does it give you the shivers , old woman , when I talk like that ? "
89121	89132	89133	89133	she	129	" Well , I wo n't , then . But if-- "
89138	89171	89135	89135	her	129	little--"if George casts me off , do n't expect me to sing psalms and take it piously . I do n't know myself just lately -- I seem quite strange to myself . "
89227	89230	89233	89233	herself	129	" love , "
89290	89299	89300	89300	she	129	" If he does n't come before dark , "
89312	89320	89304	89304	her	129	off--"it will be finished . If he does-- "
89561	89565	89566	89566	she	129	" Nearly four o'clock-- "
89567	89601	89609	89609	she	129	thought--"I'll give it an hour . He 'd send -- if he could n't come , and he wanted to come -- but if nothing happens -- I shall know what to think . "
89783	89786	89787	89787	She	129	" Diary . "
90091	90372	90785	90785	she	3047	" He must have got my letter by now . I sent it by Janet this morning . He was n't there -- but by now he must have got home -- he is probably reading it at this moment . Whatever happens to me -- I want just to say this -- to write it down now , while I can -- I shall never blame George , and I shall always love him -- with all my heart , with all my soul . He has the right to say he ca n't trust me -- I told him so in my letter this morning -- that I am not fit to be his wife . He has the right -- and very likely he will say it . The terrible thing is that I do n't trust myself . If I look forward and ask myself -- shall I always feel as I do now?--I ca n't honestly be sure . There is something in me that wants change -- always something new -- some fresh experience . I ca n't even imagine the time when I should n't love George . The mere thought of losing him is awful -- unspeakable . But yet -- I will write it down frankly!--nothing has ever lasted with me very long . It is like the farm . I used to love every minute of the day , every bit of the work , however dull and dirty it was ; and now -- I love it still -- but I seem already -- sometimes -- to be looking forward to the day when I shall be tired of it .
90373	90395	90785	90785	she	3047	" Why am I made like that ? I do n't know . But I ca n't feel that I am responsible .
90396	90474	90785	90785	she	3047	" Perhaps if George forgives me , I shall be so happy that everything will change -- my own character first of all . That is my hope . For though I suppose I am vain -- though I like people to admire me and make much of me -- I am not really in love with myself at all . If I were , I could n't be in love with George -- we are so different .
90475	90578	90785	90785	she	3047	" I do n't feel yet that I know him . Perhaps now I never shall . I often find myself wishing that he had something to confess to me . I would hardly let him -- he should never humble himself to me . But to feel that I _ could _ forgive him something , and that he would owe me something -- would be very sweet , very heavenly . I would make it so easy for him . Is he feeling like that towards me ? ' Poor child -- she was very young -- and so miserable ! '
90579	90623	90785	90785	she	3047	" I must n't write like this -- it makes me cry . There is a beautiful yellow sunset outside , and the world seems very still . He must be here soon -- or a messenger . Janet asked him not to wait .
90624	90777	90785	90785	she	3047	" After all , I do n't think I am so changeable . I have just been running myself down -- but I do n't really believe I could ever change -- towards him . Oh , George!--George!--my George!--come to me!--don't give me up . George , darling , you could do anything with me you liked -- don't despair of me ! In the Gospel , it was the bad women who were forgiven because they loved ' much . ' Now I understand why . Because love makes new . It is so terribly _ strong _ . It is either a poison -- or life -- immortal life . I have never been able to believe in the things Janet believes in . But I think I do now believe in immortality -- in something within you that ca n't die -- when once it has begun to live . "
90863	90869	90842	90842	He	3050	" Did you want me ? "
90870	90878	90879	90879	he	3050	" I wanted to tell you something , "
90888	90905	90879	90879	he	3050	her--"Don't let the girls hear . But that man 's been seen again . The tramp . "
90934	90948	90949	90949	he	3050	" There are two or three people think they 've seen him lately , "
90953	90959	90949	90949	he	3050	" A man from Dobson 's farm"--(the
90968	90996	90909	90909	She	131	village)--"who was on the hill yesterday evening , just before dark , was certain he saw somebody hanging about the back of the farm in a queer way-- "
90997	91001	91003	91003	Janet	131	" Last night ? "
91005	91131	90909	90909	She	131	" Yes . And there are two people who remember meeting a man on the X -- road who said he was going to Walton End . And the police have been inquiring , but nobody at Walton End knows anything about such a man . However , they have a description of him at last . A tall , dark fellow -- gentlemanly manners -- seems delicate . I do n't like the look of it , Miss Janet . Seems to me as though it were n't just a tramp , hanging about for what he can steal . Do you know of anybody who has a down on Miss Henderson -- who'd like to frighten her , or put blackmail on her ? "
91206	91218	91219	91219	she	131	" Besides -- I'd like to be out of the way , "
91222	91231	91219	91219	she	131	" They wo n't want anybody hanging round ! "
91357	91375	91378	91378	she	131	" And then -- either Rachel or the Captain will have to tell the police the truth ! "
91389	91396	91382	91382	Rachel	129	" Where are you off to ? "
91397	91417	91382	91382	Rachel	129	" I have forgotten something I wanted from Millsborough . I shall be back in an hour or so . "
91533	91538	91532	91532	her	131	" a diviner air . "
91611	91617	91606	91606	Rachel	129	" Are you off soon ? "
91618	91635	91606	91606	Rachel	129	" No , Miss. I shall sleep over the stable . That horse wants looking after . "
92058	92061	92043	92043	he	3075	" Rachel ! "
92118	92124	92113	92113	Hastings	127	" Good God , Sir ! "
92125	92132	92134	92134	Ellesborough	198	" A doctor!--Go for a doctor ! "
92135	92141	92134	92134	Ellesborough	198	hoarsely--"No -- she 's gone ! "
92199	92204	92198	92202	the " fierce workman Death	4297	" fierce workman Death . "
92247	92258	92260	92261	the Superintendent	3091	" Can you throw any light upon it , Sir ? "
92288	92292	92283	92284	The Captain	847	" Her husband did it"--he
92295	92302	92283	92284	The Captain	847	quietly--"the man who was her husband . "
92312	92321	92323	92324	the Superintendent	3091	" Did I hear you right , Sir ? "
92326	92333	92323	92324	the Superintendent	3091	" Miss Henderson passed for unmarried . "
92334	92345	92347	92347	Ellesborough	198	" She married a man called Roger Delane in Canada , "
92355	92435	92347	92347	Ellesborough	198	" She divorced him -- for cruelty and adultery -- two years ago . A few days since he waylaid her in the dark , and threatened her . I did n't know this till she wrote to me to - day . She said that she was afraid of him -- that she thought he was mad -- and I came over at once to see how I could protect her . We were engaged to be married . "
92793	92873	92786	92786	She	131	" The Superintendent asked my leave to go into her room -- in case there was anything which could help them . He brought me this . She had been writing in it -- He asked me to look at it . I did -- just enough to see -- that no one had any right to it -- but you . She wrote it I think about an hour before you came . It was her last word . "
92874	92879	92880	92880	Ellesborough	198	" I have her letters also"--said
92889	92907	92886	92886	he	198	book--"You brought it -- you kind woman ! You were her good angel -- God reward you ! "
