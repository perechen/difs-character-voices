89	94	95	95	she	100	" Quite an ovation , "
107	126	95	95	she	100	" They 'll take us for royalty . Oh , Mr. Kingcroft , get us foot - warmers . "
176	179	180	180	he	172	" Remember , "
183	259	180	180	he	172	" that it is only by going off the track that you get to know the country . See the little towns - Gubbio , Pienza , Cortona , San Gemignano , Monteriano . And do n't , let me beg you , go with that awful tourist idea that Italy 's only a museum of antiquities and art . Love and understand the Italians , for the people are more marvellous than the land . "
260	270	271	271	she	100	" How I wish you were coming , Philip , "
289	295	271	271	she	100	" I wish I were . "
350	363	364	364	She	100	" Good - bye , dear every one . What a whirl ! "
384	404	364	364	She	100	" Good - bye , darling . Mind you 're always good , and do what Granny tells you . "
445	452	432	432	Irma	103	" I 'll do my best . "
453	461	463	464	Mrs. Herriton	104	" She is sure to be good , "
511	529	478	478	Lilia	100	" Caroline , my Caroline ! Jump in , or your chaperon will go off without you . "
660	665	667	667	Harriet	102	" Handkerchiefs and collars , "
669	683	667	667	Harriet	102	" in my inlaid box ! I 've lent you my inlaid box . "
684	689	690	690	She	100	" Good old Harry ! "
821	840	808	808	he	106	" Good - bye , Mrs. Charles . May you enjoy yourself , and may God bless you . "
866	874	875	875	she	100	" Oh , I am so sorry , "
879	900	875	875	she	100	" but you do look so funny . Oh , you all look so funny waving ! Oh , pray ! "
913	923	925	926	Mrs. Theobald	105	" High spirits to begin so long a journey , "
943	947	949	949	he	106	" I wish , "
951	972	949	949	he	106	" that Mrs. Charles had gotten the footwarmer . These London porters wo n't take heed to a country chap . "
973	980	982	983	Mrs. Herriton	104	" But you did your best , "
985	1010	982	983	Mrs. Herriton	104	" And I think it simply noble of you to have brought Mrs. Theobald all the way here on such a day as this . "
1123	1137	1139	1139	Irma	103	" And , Granny , when will the old ship get to Italy ? "
1141	1153	1155	1156	Mrs. Herriton	104	" ' Grandmother , ' dear ; not ' Granny , ' "
1163	1230	1155	1156	Mrs. Herriton	104	" And we say ' a boat ' or ' a steamer , ' not ' a ship . ' Ships have sails . And mother wo n't go all the way by sea . You look at the map of Europe , and you 'll see why . Harriet , take her . Go with Aunt Harriet , and she 'll show you the map . "
1231	1234	1236	1238	the little girl	253	" Righto ! "
1265	1272	1274	1274	Philip	172	" Here beginneth the New Life , "
1276	1283	1285	1286	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Poor child , how vulgar ! "
1288	1310	1285	1286	Mrs. Herriton	104	" It 's surprising that she is n't worse . But she has got a look of poor Charles about her . "
1311	1350	1402	1403	Mrs. Herriton	104	" And - alas , alas ! - a look of old Mrs. Theobald . What appalling apparition was that ! I did think the lady was bedridden as well as imbecile . Why ever did she come ? "
1351	1377	1285	1286	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Mr. Kingcroft made her . I am certain of it . He wanted to see Lilia again , and this was the only way . "
1378	1401	1402	1403	Mrs. Herriton	104	" I hope he is satisfied . I did not think my sister - in - law distinguished herself in her farewells . "
1406	1447	1402	1403	Mrs. Herriton	104	" I mind nothing , so long as she has gone - and gone with Miss Abbott . It is mortifying to think that a widow of thirty - three requires a girl ten years younger to look after her . "
1448	1504	1402	1403	Mrs. Herriton	104	" I pity Miss Abbott . Fortunately one admirer is chained to England . Mr. Kingcroft can not leave the crops or the climate or something . I do n't think , either , he improved his chances today . He , as well as Lilia , has the knack of being absurd in public . "
1509	1539	1505	1506	Mrs. Herriton	104	" When a man is neither well bred , nor well connected , nor handsome , nor clever , nor rich , even Lilia may discard him in time . "
1540	1600	1285	1286	Mrs. Herriton	104	" No . I believe she would take any one . Right up to the last , when her boxes were packed , she was ' playing ' the chinless curate . Both the curates are chinless , but hers had the dampest hands . I came on them in the Park . They were speaking of the Pentateuch . "
1601	1627	1505	1506	Mrs. Herriton	104	" My dear boy ! If possible , she has got worse and worse . It was your idea of Italian travel that saved us ! "
1635	1734	1628	1628	Philip	172	" The odd part is that she was quite eager - always asking me for information ; and of course I was very glad to give it . I admit she is a Philistine , appallingly ignorant , and her taste in art is false . Still , to have any taste at all is something . And I do believe that Italy really purifies and ennobles all who visit her . She is the school as well as the playground of the world . It is really to Lilia 's credit that she wants to go there . "
1735	1741	1285	1286	Mrs. Herriton	104	" She would go anywhere , "
1756	1772	1743	1754	his mother , who had heard enough of the praises of Italy	257	" I and Caroline Abbott had the greatest difficulty in dissuading her from the Riviera . "
1773	1796	1797	1797	He	172	" No , Mother ; no . She was really keen on Italy . This travel is quite a crisis for her . "
2508	2514	2496	2496	they	284	" as a gentleman friend , "
2674	2681	2682	2682	she	100	" In a place like this , "
2685	2722	2682	2682	she	100	" one really does feel in the heart of things , and off the beaten track . Looking out of a Gothic window every morning , it seems impossible that the middle ages have passed away . "
2742	2751	2753	2754	Mrs. Herriton	104	" It is something that she is contented , "
2756	2775	2753	2754	Mrs. Herriton	104	" But no one could live three months with Caroline Abbott and not be the better for it . "
2973	2982	2983	2983	he	172	" They 've stopped there over a week ! "
2986	3012	2983	2983	he	172	" Why ! I should n't have done as much myself . They must be really keen , for the hotel 's none too comfortable . "
3013	3020	3022	3022	Harriet	102	" I can not understand people , "
3024	3043	3022	3022	Harriet	102	" What can they be doing all day ? And there is no church there , I suppose . "
3044	3059	2983	2983	he	172	" There is Santa Deodata , one of the most beautiful churches in Italy . "
3060	3069	3071	3071	Harriet	102	" Of course I mean an English church , "
3074	3090	3071	3071	Harriet	102	" Lilia promised me that she would always be in a large town on Sundays . "
3091	3121	2983	2983	he	172	" If she goes to a service at Santa Deodata 's , she will find more beauty and sincerity than there is in all the Back Kitchens of Europe . "
3158	3234	2983	2983	he	172	" Now , dears , do n't . Listen to Lilia 's letter . ' We love this place , and I do not know how I shall ever thank Philip for telling me it . It is not only so quaint , but one sees the Italians unspoiled in all their simplicity and charm here . The frescoes are wonderful . Caroline , who grows sweeter every day , is very busy sketching . ' "
3235	3242	3244	3244	Harriet	102	" Every one to his taste ! "
3289	3298	3300	3300	Philip	172	" Oh , Harriet is a bad lot ! "
3346	3352	3354	3355	her uncle	311	" One moment , Irma , "
3357	3375	3354	3355	her uncle	311	" I 'm going to the station . I 'll give you the pleasure of my company . "
3497	3513	3515	3516	Mrs. Herriton	104	" We will save the peas to the last ; they are the greatest fun , "
3565	3577	3563	3563	she	102	" bolted all the cardinal virtues and could n't digest them . "
3666	3674	3675	3675	she	102	" It 's a shame , Mother ! "
3679	3720	3675	3675	she	102	" Philip laughs at everything - the Book Club , the Debating Society , the Progressive Whist , the bazaars . People wo n't like it . We have our reputation . A house divided against itself can not stand . "
3729	3747	3721	3722	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Let Philip say what he likes , and he will let us do what we like . "
3810	3830	3804	3804	she	104	" It 's twelve ! The second post 's in . Run and see if there are any letters . "
3838	3852	3804	3804	she	104	" Let 's finish the peas . There wo n't be any letters . "
3853	3883	3804	3804	she	104	" No , dear ; please go . I 'll sow the peas , but you shall cover them up - and mind the birds do n't see 'em ! "
3921	3927	3929	3929	Harriet	102	" Actually old Mrs. Theobald ! "
3933	3951	3884	3885	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Read me the letter . My hands are dirty . How intolerable the crested paper is . "
3957	3963	3964	3964	she	102	" I do n't understand , "
3967	3974	3964	3964	she	102	" it does n't make sense . "
3975	3981	4020	4021	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Her letters never did . "
3982	3991	3993	3993	Harriet	102	" But it must be sillier than usual , "
4002	4019	3993	3993	Harriet	102	" Look here , read it , Mother ; I ca n't make head or tail . "
4027	4033	4034	4034	she	104	" What is the difficulty ? "
4041	4052	4034	4034	she	104	" What is it that puzzles you in this letter ? "
4053	4057	4059	4059	Harriet	102	" The meaning - "
4072	4134	4136	4136	she	102	" The meaning is quite clear - Lilia is engaged to be married . Do n't cry , dear ; please me by not crying - do n't talk at all . It 's more than I could bear . She is going to marry some one she has met in a hotel . Take the letter and read for yourself . "
4147	4193	4195	4195	she	102	" How dare she not tell me direct ! How dare she write first to Yorkshire ! Pray , am I to hear through Mrs. Theobald - a patronizing , insolent letter like this ? Have I no claim at all ? Bear witness , dear "
4200	4212	4195	4195	she	102	" bear witness that for this I 'll never forgive her ! "
4213	4222	4224	4224	Harriet	102	" Oh , what is to be done ? "
4226	4233	4224	4224	Harriet	102	" What is to be done ? "
4234	4238	4239	4239	She	102	" This first ! "
4253	4279	4239	4239	She	102	" Next , a telegram for Lilia ! No ! a telegram for Miss Caroline Abbott . She , too , has something to explain . "
4280	4289	4291	4291	Harriet	102	" Oh , what is to be done ? "
4321	4328	4314	4315	awful person	325	" Some one in the hotel . "
4352	4363	4365	4366	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Wire reason of stay at Monteriano . Strange rumours , "
4382	4390	4391	4391	she	104	" If there is an office there , "
4394	4441	4391	4391	she	104	" we might get an answer this evening . Since Philip is back at seven , and the eight - fifteen catches the midnight boat at Dover - Harriet , when you go with this , get 100 pounds in 5 pound notes at the bank . "
4442	4485	4490	4490	she	104	" Go , dear , at once ; do not talk . I see Irma coming back ; go quickly .... Well , Irma dear , and whose team are you in this afternoon - Miss Edith 's or Miss May 's ? "
4544	4549	4501	4501	she	104	" Sub - Apennines . "
4614	4618	4608	4608	She	104	" Childe Harold , "
4634	4638	4608	4608	She	104	" Tramp Abroad . "
4670	4674	4676	4676	Baedeker	126	" Central Italy , "
4834	4847	4816	4819	Dante Purg . xx	127	" POGGIBONIZZI , FAUI IN LA , CHE MONTERIANO SI FA CITTA ! "
4969	4981	4965	4965	Philip	172	" The view from the Rocca small gratuity is finest at sunset "
5070	5078	5080	5082	the agonized Harriet	356	" Your feet grow larger every day , "
5136	5142	5144	5145	Mrs. Herriton	104	" It is too bad , "
5190	5234	5185	5186	her mother	270	" It 's ridiculous to read , dear . She 's not trying to marry any one in the place . Some tourist , obviously , who 's stopping in the hotel . The place has nothing to do with it at all . "
5235	5257	5185	5186	her mother	270	" But what a place to go to ! What nice person , too , do you meet in a hotel ? "
5258	5342	5185	5186	her mother	270	" Nice or nasty , as I have told you several times before , is not the point . Lilia has insulted our family , and she shall suffer for it . And when you speak against hotels , I think you forget that I met your father at Chamounix . You can contribute nothing , dear , at present , and I think you had better hold your tongue . I am going to the kitchen , to speak about the range . "
5478	5489	5552	5552	Lilia	100	" Lilia engaged to Italian nobility . Writing . Abbott . "
5490	5494	5496	5497	Mrs. Herriton	104	" No answer , "
5499	5510	5496	5497	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Get down Mr. Philip 's Gladstone from the attic . "
5566	5570	5556	5556	she	100	" Italian nobility . "
5580	5603	5571	5571	She	104	" We love this place - Caroline is sweeter than ever , and busy sketching - Italians full of simplicity and charm . "
5610	5621	5608	5608	Baedeker	126	" The inhabitants are still noted for their agreeable manners , "
5734	5792	5731	5731	she	307	" The man may be a duke or he may be an organ - grinder . That is not the point . If Lilia marries him she insults the memory of Charles , she insults Irma , she insults us . Therefore I forbid her , and if she disobeys we have done with her for ever . "
5793	5801	5803	5803	Philip	172	" I will do all I can , "
6067	6069	6059	6059	He	382	" legno "
6472	6511	6468	6468	she	107	" I am John Bull to the backbone , yet I do want to see Italy , just once . Everybody says it is marvellous , and that one gets no idea of it from books at all . "
6534	6575	6524	6525	Miss Abbott	107	" Oh , but you must let me have my fling ! I promise to have it once , and once only . It will give me things to think about and talk about for the rest of my life . "
6835	6844	6845	6845	he	172	" Are we to talk it over now ? "
6848	6853	6855	6856	Miss Abbott	107	" Certainly , please , "
6862	6871	6855	6856	Miss Abbott	107	" If you will be so very kind . "
6872	6881	6882	6882	Her	107	" Then how long has she been engaged ? "
6896	6906	6907	6907	she	107	" A short time - quite a short time , "
6921	6935	6969	6969	he	172	" I should like to know how long , if you can remember . "
6945	6950	6951	6951	she	107	" Exactly eleven days , "
6956	6964	6969	6969	he	172	" How long have you been here ? "
6976	6982	6969	6969	he	172	" Close on three weeks . "
6983	6992	6969	6969	he	172	" Did you know him before you came ? "
6993	6996	6969	6969	he	172	" No . "
6997	7004	6969	6969	he	172	" Oh ! Who is he ? "
7005	7012	6969	6969	he	172	" A native of the place . "
7068	7077	7042	7043	The driver	426	" I understood they met at the hotel . "
7078	7088	7042	7043	The driver	426	" It was a mistake of Mrs. Theobald 's . "
7089	7103	7042	7043	The driver	426	" I also understand that he is a member of the Italian nobility . "
7109	7117	7104	7104	She	429	" May I be told his name ? "
7122	7125	7118	7119	Miss Abbott	107	" Carella . "
7147	7157	7042	7043	The driver	426	" Carella ? Conte or Marchese , or what ? "
7158	7161	7163	7164	Miss Abbott	107	" Signor , "
7171	7187	7042	7043	The driver	426	" Perhaps I bore you with these questions . If so , I will stop . "
7188	7228	7042	7043	The driver	426	" Oh , no , please ; not at all . I am here - my own idea - to give all information which you very naturally - and to see if somehow - please ask anything you like . "
7229	7236	7042	7043	The driver	426	" Then how old is he ? "
7237	7250	7042	7043	The driver	426	" Oh , quite young . Twenty - one , I believe . "
7258	7262	7254	7254	Philip	172	" Good Lord ! "
7263	7270	7272	7273	Miss Abbott	107	" One would never believe it , "
7277	7283	7272	7273	Miss Abbott	107	" He looks much older . "
7284	7292	7293	7293	he	172	" And is he good - looking ? "
7304	7334	7300	7300	She	107	" Very good - looking . All his features are good , and he is well built - though I dare say English standards would find him too short . "
7354	7363	7300	7300	She	107	" May I conclude that you like him ? "
7369	7381	7364	7364	She	107	" As far as I have seen him , I do . "
7535	7549	7551	7552	Miss Abbott	107	" As far as I have seen him , I do like him , "
7572	7591	7558	7558	He	172	" What is he , please ? You have n't told me that . What 's his position ? "
7620	7650	7708	7708	She	107	" No position at all . He is kicking his heels , as my father would say . You see , he has only just finished his military service . "
7651	7656	7708	7708	She	107	" As a private ? "
7657	7683	7708	7708	She	107	" I suppose so . There is general conscription . He was in the Bersaglieri , I think . Is n't that the crack regiment ? "
7684	7707	7708	7708	She	107	" The men in it must be short and broad . They must also be able to walk six miles an hour . "
7738	7756	7730	7730	she	107	" And now , like most young men , he is looking out for something to do . "
7757	7760	7730	7730	she	107	" Meanwhile ? "
7761	7790	7730	7730	she	107	" Meanwhile , like most young men , he lives with his people - father , mother , two sisters , and a tiny tot of a brother . "
7812	7827	7730	7730	she	107	" One more question , and only one more . What is his father ? "
7828	7832	7834	7835	Miss Abbott	107	" His father , "
7837	7883	7834	7835	Miss Abbott	107	" Well , I do n't suppose you 'll think it a good match . But that 's not the point . I mean the point is not - I mean that social differences - love , after all - not but what - I - "
7893	7934	7730	7730	she	107	" Gentlemen sometimes judge hardly . But I feel that you , and at all events your mother - so really good in every sense , so really unworldly - after all , love - marriages are made in heaven . "
7935	7971	8019	8022	A dentist at Monteriano	443	" Yes , Miss Abbott , I know . But I am anxious to hear heaven 's choice . You arouse my curiosity . Is my sister - in - law to marry an angel ? "
7972	7993	7730	7730	she	107	" Mr. Herriton , do n't - please , Mr. Herriton - a dentist . His father 's a dentist . "
8169	8180	8181	8181	he	172	" I can not think what is in the air , "
8184	8250	8181	8181	he	172	" If Lilia was determined to disgrace us , she might have found a less repulsive way . A boy of medium height with a pretty face , the son of a dentist at Monteriano . Have I put it correctly ? May I surmise that he has not got one penny ? May I also surmise that his social position is nil ? Furthermore - "
8251	8261	8338	8338	he	453	" Stop ! I 'll tell you no more . "
8262	8282	8181	8181	he	172	" Really , Miss Abbott , it is a little late for reticence . You have equipped me admirably ! "
8283	8292	8293	8293	she	452	" I 'll tell you not another word ! "
9005	9008	9009	9009	she	100	" Welcome ! "
9012	9017	9018	9018	He	172	" Welcome to Monteriano ! "
9042	9050	9051	9051	she	100	" You told me to come here , "
9054	9068	9051	9051	she	100	" and I do n't forget it . Let me introduce Signor Carella ! "
9136	9146	9148	9148	Lilia	100	" Well , din - din 's nearly ready , "
9150	9166	9148	9148	Lilia	100	" Your room 's down the passage , Philip . You need n't go changing . "
9181	9185	9187	9187	Lilia	100	" Dear Caroline ! "
9195	9222	9187	9187	Lilia	100	" What an angel you 've been to tell him ! He takes it so well . But you must have had a MAUVAIS QUART D'HEURE . "
9233	9239	9240	9240	she	100	" I 've told nothing , "
9243	9265	9240	9240	she	100	" It 's all for you - and if it only takes a quarter of an hour you 'll be lucky ! "
9725	9740	9698	9699	Signor Carella	131	" England is a great country . The Italians love England and the English . "
9753	9757	9758	9759	the other	470	" Italy too , "
9765	9811	9758	9759	the other	470	" is a great country . She has produced many famous men - for example Garibaldi and Dante . The latter wrote the ' Inferno , ' the ' Purgatorio , ' the ' Paradiso . ' The ' Inferno ' is the most beautiful . "
9965	9970	9972	9972	Lilia	100	" Oh , look ! "
9974	9980	9972	9972	Lilia	100	" the poor wee fish ! "
10069	10077	10079	10080	Miss Abbott	107	" But may not the fish die ? "
10082	10088	10079	10080	Miss Abbott	107	" They have no air . "
10089	10099	10100	10100	he	172	" Fish live on water , not on air , "
10156	10197	10139	10139	She	100	" Well , Philip , I am sure you are ready for by - bye . We shall meet at twelve o'clock lunch tomorrow , if we do n't meet before . They give us caffe later in our rooms . "
10208	10233	10205	10205	Philip	172	" I should like to see you now , please , in my room , as I have come all the way on business . "
10286	10336	10282	10282	he	172	" My dear Lilia , do n't let 's have a scene . Before I arrived I thought I might have to question you . It is unnecessary . I know everything . Miss Abbott has told me a certain amount , and the rest I see for myself . "
10337	10342	10343	10343	she	100	" See for yourself ? "
10356	10368	10282	10282	he	172	" That he is probably a ruffian and certainly a cad . "
10369	10377	10378	10378	she	100	" There are no cads in Italy , "
10403	10415	10396	10396	she	100	" He is the son of a dentist . Why not ? "
10416	10453	10396	10396	she	100	" Thank you for the information . I know everything , as I told you before . I am also aware of the social position of an Italian who pulls teeth in a minute provincial town . "
10487	10507	10480	10480	she	100	" Indeed , Philip , you surprise me . I understood you went in for equality and so on . "
10508	10523	10480	10480	she	100	" And I understood that Signor Carella was a member of the Italian nobility . "
10524	10570	10571	10571	She	100	" Well , we put it like that in the telegram so as not to shock dear Mrs. Herriton . But it is true . He is a younger branch . Of course families ramify - just as in yours there is your cousin Joseph . "
10584	10660	10571	10571	She	100	" Gino 's father is courtesy itself , and rising rapidly in his profession . This very month he leaves Monteriano , and sets up at Poggibonsi . And for my own poor part , I think what people are is what matters , but I do n't suppose you 'll agree . And I should like you to know that Gino 's uncle is a priest - the same as a clergyman at home . "
10685	10696	10680	10680	Lilia	100	" Well , his cousin 's a lawyer at Rome . "
10697	10705	10680	10680	Lilia	100	" What kind of ' lawyer ' ? "
10706	10729	10680	10680	Lilia	100	" Why , a lawyer just like you are - except that he has lots to do and can never get away . "
10758	10891	10740	10740	He	172	" The whole thing is like a bad dream - so bad that it can not go on . If there was one redeeming feature about the man I might be uneasy . As it is I can trust to time . For the moment , Lilia , he has taken you in , but you will find him out soon . It is not possible that you , a lady , accustomed to ladies and gentlemen , will tolerate a man whose position is - well , not equal to the son of the servants ' dentist in Coronation Place . I am not blaming you now . But I blame the glamour of Italy - I have felt it myself , you know - and I greatly blame Miss Abbott . "
10892	10908	10742	10742	his	172	" Caroline ! Why blame her ? What 's all this to do with Caroline ? "
10909	10916	10917	10917	He	517	" Because we expected her to - "
10936	11013	10931	10931	his	517	" So I am confident , and you in your heart agree , that this engagement will not last . Think of your life at home - think of Irma ! And I 'll also say think of us ; for you know , Lilia , that we count you more than a relation . I should feel I was losing my own sister if you did this , and my mother would lose a daughter . "
11029	11038	11021	11021	she	518	" I ca n't break it off now ! "
11039	11043	11045	11045	he	519	" Poor Lilia , "
11050	11121	11045	11045	he	519	" I know it may be painful . But I have come to rescue you , and , book - worm though I may be , I am not frightened to stand up to a bully . He 's merely an insolent boy . He thinks he can keep you to your word by threats . He will be different when he sees he has a man to deal with . "
11176	11393	11167	11167	Lilia	100	" For once in my life I 'll thank you to leave me alone . I 'll thank your mother too . For twelve years you 've trained me and tortured me , and I 'll stand it no more . Do you think I 'm a fool ? Do you think I never felt ? Ah ! when I came to your house a poor young bride , how you all looked me over - never a kind word - and discussed me , and thought I might just do ; and your mother corrected me , and your sister snubbed me , and you said funny things about me to show how clever you were ! And when Charles died I was still to run in strings for the honour of your beastly family , and I was to be cooped up at Sawston and learn to keep house , and all my chances spoilt of marrying again . No , thank you ! No , thank you ! ' Bully ? ' ' Insolent boy ? ' Who 's that , pray , but you ? But , thank goodness , I can stand up against the world now , for I 've found Gino , and this time I marry for love ! "
11419	11527	11406	11406	her	520	" Yes ! and I forbid you to do it ! You despise me , perhaps , and think I 'm feeble . But you 're mistaken . You are ungrateful and impertinent and contemptible , but I will save you in order to save Irma and our name . There is going to be such a row in this town that you and he 'll be sorry you came to it . I shall shrink from nothing , for my blood is up . It is unwise of you to laugh . I forbid you to marry Carella , and I shall tell him so now . "
11528	11531	11532	11532	she	522	" Do , "
11535	11562	11532	11532	she	522	" Tell him so now . Have it out with him . Gino ! Gino ! Come in ! Avanti ! Fra Filippo forbids the banns ! "
11577	11600	11601	11601	She	522	" Fra Filippo 's blood 's up . He shrinks from nothing . Oh , take care he does n't hurt you ! "
11673	11681	11683	11683	Philip	172	" Please sit down , Signor Carella , "
11687	11716	11683	11683	Philip	172	" Mrs. Herriton is rather agitated , but there is no reason we should not be calm . Might I offer you a cigarette ? Please sit down . "
11838	11905	12010	12010	He	172	" Signor Carella , I will be frank with you . I have come to prevent you marrying Mrs. Herriton , because I see you will both be unhappy together . She is English , you are Italian ; she is accustomed to one thing , you to another . And - pardon me if I say it - she is rich and you are poor . "
11906	11917	12010	12010	He	172	" I am not marrying her because she is rich , "
11923	11932	11934	11934	Philip	172	" I never suggested that for a moment , "
11937	12002	11934	11934	Philip	172	" You are honourable , I am sure ; but are you wise ? And let me remind you that we want her with us at home . Her little daughter will be motherless , our home will be broken up . If you grant my request you will earn our thanks - and you will not be without a reward for your disappointment . "
12003	12009	12010	12010	He	172	" Reward - what reward ? "
12039	12046	12035	12035	Philip	172	" What about a thousand lire ? "
12077	12084	12057	12057	he	172	" You can have them tonight . "
12092	12098	12085	12085	He	172	" It is too late . "
12099	12103	12108	12108	His	172	" But why ? "
12104	12107	12108	12108	His	172	" Because - "
12250	12298	12223	12223	Gino	144	" Because we are married - married - married as soon as I knew you were , coming . There was no time to tell you . Oh . oh ! You have come all the way for nothing . Oh ! And oh , your generosity ! "
12307	12327	12300	12300	he	172	" Please pardon me ; I am rude . I am no better than a peasant , and I - "
12449	12456	12457	12457	he	172	" I sleep at the Globo , "
12461	12484	12457	12457	he	172	" and start for Sawston tomorrow morning early . He has assaulted me . I could prosecute him . But shall not . "
12485	12492	12493	12493	she	107	" I ca n't stop here , "
12496	12512	12493	12493	she	107	" I dare n't stop here . You will have to take me with you ! "
13722	13734	13735	13735	she	100	" Look what I am giving up to live with you ! "
13770	13808	13809	13809	She	100	" Silly fellow , no ! I mean the life . Those Herritons are very well connected . They lead Sawston society . But what do I care , so long as I have my silly fellow ! "
13894	13902	13903	13903	she	100	" It may n't be heaven below , "
13906	13914	13903	13903	she	100	" but it 's better than Charles . "
14011	14039	13997	13997	He	144	" The air is good , so is the food ; she will be happy here , and we shall not have to part with the money . "
14119	14126	14127	14127	she	100	" Oh , you idle boy ! "
14134	14140	14127	14127	she	100	" Go and play pallone . "
14141	14148	14149	14149	he	144	" I am a married man , "
14157	14166	14149	14149	he	144	" I do not play games any more . "
14167	14175	14127	14127	she	100	" Go and see your friends then . "
14176	14183	14149	14149	he	144	" I have no friends now . "
14184	14199	14127	14127	she	100	" Silly , silly , silly ! You ca n't stop indoors all day ! "
14200	14210	14211	14211	He	144	" I want to see no one but you . "
14220	14250	14127	14127	she	100	" Now , Gino , do n't be silly . Go and see your friends , and bring them to see me . We both of us like society . "
14293	14304	14305	14305	she	100	" I 'm ready , too , for people now , "
14308	14348	14305	14305	she	100	" I mean to wake you all up , just as I woke up Sawston . Let 's have plenty of men - and make them bring their womenkind . I mean to have real English tea - parties . "
14349	14370	14446	14446	She	100	" There is my aunt and her husband ; but I thought you did not want to receive my relatives . "
14371	14378	14305	14305	she	100	" I never said such a - "
14379	14386	14387	14387	he	608	" But you would be right , "
14391	14422	14387	14387	he	608	" They are not for you . Many of them are in trade , and even we are little more ; you should have gentlefolk and nobility for your friends . "
14423	14427	14429	14429	Lilia	100	" Poor fellow , "
14431	14445	14446	14446	She	100	" It is sad for him to discover that his people are vulgar . "
14471	14494	14446	14446	She	100	" But besides your relatives I must have other people here . Your friends have wives and sisters , have n't they ? "
14495	14508	14452	14452	she	100	" Oh , yes ; but of course I scarcely know them . "
14509	14517	14446	14446	She	100	" Not know your friends ' people ? "
14518	14545	14546	14546	He	608	" Why , no . If they are poor and have to work for their living I may see them - but not otherwise . Except - "
14580	14608	14612	14612	her	610	" How funny ! But I mean to change all that . Bring your friends to see me , and I will make them bring their people . "
14616	14630	14609	14609	He	608	" Well , who are the principal people here ? Who leads society ? "
14647	14654	14609	14609	He	608	" Well , are they married ? "
14655	14658	14609	14609	He	608	" Yes . "
14659	14669	14609	14609	He	608	" There we are . Do you know them ? "
14670	14677	14609	14609	He	608	" Yes - in a way . "
14678	14682	14683	14683	she	610	" I see , "
14687	14702	14683	14683	she	610	" They look down on you , do they , poor boy ? Wait ! "
14706	14722	14703	14703	He	608	" Wait ! I 'll soon stop that . Now , who else is there ? "
14723	14737	14609	14609	He	608	" The marchese , sometimes , and the canons of the Collegiate Church . "
14738	14741	14703	14703	He	608	" Married ? "
14742	14746	14747	14747	he	608	" The canons - "
14753	14798	14703	14703	He	608	" Oh , I forgot your horrid celibacy . In England they would be the centre of everything . But why should n't I know them ? Would it make it easier if I called all round ? Is n't that your foreign way ? "
14809	14828	14703	14703	He	608	" But I must know some one ! Who were the men you were talking to this afternoon ? "
14841	14868	14930	14930	his	144	" But , Gino dear , if they 're low class , why did you talk to them ? Do n't you care about your position ? "
14892	14928	14883	14883	his	144	" Ouf - pouf ! How hot it is in here . No air ; I sweat all over . I expire . I must cool myself , or I shall never get to sleep . "
15504	15508	15509	15509	he	144	" And I , "
15512	15531	15509	15509	he	144	" though I am young , am at all events a man , and know what is right . "
15567	15575	15576	15576	he	144	" You must not go out alone , "
15580	15597	15576	15576	he	144	" It is not safe . If you want to walk , Perfetta shall accompany you . "
15618	15622	15633	15633	she	100	" Very well , "
15626	15629	15633	15633	she	100	" very well "
15932	15938	15939	15939	he	144	" They all do it , "
15942	15946	15939	15939	he	144	" myself excepted . "
15955	15985	15939	15939	he	144	" But tell me more . She is English . That is good , very good . An English wife is very good indeed . And she is rich ? "
15986	15990	15939	15939	he	144	" Immensely rich . "
15991	15996	15939	15939	he	144	" Blonde or dark ? "
15997	16000	15939	15939	he	144	" Blonde . "
16001	16006	15939	15939	he	144	" Is it possible ! "
16007	16014	16016	16016	Gino	144	" It pleases me very much , "
16019	16030	16016	16016	Gino	144	" If you remember , I always desired a blonde . "
16042	16048	16050	16050	Spiridione	151	" We all desire one , "
16052	16093	16050	16050	Spiridione	151	" But you , Gino , deserve your good fortune , for you are a good son , a brave man , and a true friend , and from the very first moment I saw you I wished you well . "
16094	16101	16103	16103	Gino	144	" No compliments , I beg , "
16137	16151	16124	16126	the other men	679	" Is it not true ? Does not he deserve this wealthy blonde ? "
16152	16158	16160	16162	all the men	681	" He does deserve her , "
16337	16341	16343	16343	Spiridione	151	" Tell me , "
16345	16355	16343	16343	Spiridione	151	" I forgot to ask - is she young ? "
16356	16361	16480	16480	He	144	" Thirty - three . "
16362	16373	16343	16343	Spiridione	151	" Ah , well , we can not have everything . "
16374	16396	16480	16480	He	144	" But you would be surprised . Had she told me twenty - eight , I should not have disbelieved her . "
16397	16402	16343	16343	Spiridione	151	" Is she SIMPATICA ? "
16420	16424	16409	16409	Gino	144	" Sufficiently so . "
16425	16433	16480	16480	He	144	" It is a most important thing . "
16434	16454	16409	16409	Gino	144	" She is rich , she is generous , she is affable , she addresses her inferiors without haughtiness . "
16460	16466	16468	16469	the other	470	" It is not sufficient , "
16471	16479	16480	16480	He	144	" One does not define it thus . "
16488	16541	16482	16482	his	144	" Last month a German was smuggling cigars . The custom - house was dark . Yet I refused because I did not like him . The gifts of such men do not bring happiness . NON ERA SIMPATICO . He paid for every one , and the fine for deception besides . "
16542	16551	16553	16553	Gino	144	" Do you gain much beyond your pay ? "
16560	16646	16482	16482	his	144	" I do not accept small sums now . It is not worth the risk . But the German was another matter . But listen , my Gino , for I am older than you and more full of experience . The person who understands us at first sight , who never irritates us , who never bores , to whom we can pour forth every thought and wish , not only in speech but in silence - that is what I mean by SIMPATICO . "
16647	16656	16658	16658	Gino	144	" There are such men , I know , "
16660	16679	16658	16658	Gino	144	" And I have heard it said of children . But where will you find such a woman ? "
16680	16707	16708	16708	He	144	" That is true . Here you are wiser than I. SONO POCO SIMPATICHE LE DONNE . And the time we waste over them is much . "
16724	16791	16793	16793	he	144	" One I have seen who may be so . She spoke very little , but she was a young lady - different to most . She , too , was English , the companion of my wife here . But Fra Filippo , the brother - in - law , took her back with him . I saw them start . He was very angry . "
16820	16825	16827	16827	Gino	144	" I regret though , "
16835	16861	16827	16827	Gino	144	" that I toppled him on to the bed . A great tall man ! And when I am really amused I am often impolite . "
16862	16870	16880	16880	him	151	" You will never see him again , "
16882	16895	16880	16880	him	151	" And by now the scene will have passed from his mind . "
16896	16951	16827	16827	Gino	144	" It sometimes happens that such things are recollected longest . I shall never see him again , of course ; but it is no benefit to me that he should wish me ill . And even if he has forgotten , I am still sorry that I toppled him on to the bed . "
17013	17041	17009	17009	he	144	" I want to consult you since you are so kind as to take an interest in my affairs . My wife wishes to take solitary walks . "
17046	17053	17009	17009	he	144	" But I have forbidden her . "
17054	17057	17042	17042	Spiridione	151	" Naturally . "
17058	17092	17009	17009	he	144	" She does not yet understand . She asked me to accompany her sometimes - to walk without object ! You know , she would like me to be with her all day . "
17093	17100	17101	17101	He	151	" I see . I see . "
17116	17126	17110	17110	he	151	" She needs employment . Is she a Catholic ? "
17127	17130	17009	17009	he	144	" No . "
17131	17155	17110	17110	he	151	" That is a pity . She must be persuaded . It will be a great solace to her when she is alone . "
17156	17171	17009	17009	he	144	" I am a Catholic , but of course I never go to church . "
17172	17228	17110	17110	he	151	" Of course not . Still , you might take her at first . That is what my brother has done with his wife at Bologna and he has joined the Free Thinkers . He took her once or twice himself , and now she has acquired the habit and continues to go without him . "
17229	17260	17009	17009	he	144	" Most excellent advice , and I thank you for it . But she wishes to give tea - parties - men and women together whom she has never seen . "
17261	17303	17110	17110	he	151	" Oh , the English ! they are always thinking of tea . They carry it by the kilogramme in their trunks , and they are so clumsy that they always pack it at the top . But it is absurd ! "
17304	17313	17009	17009	he	144	" What am I to do about it ? "
17314	17322	17110	17110	he	151	" Do nothing . Or ask me ! "
17323	17326	17328	17328	Gino	144	" Come ! "
17333	17340	17328	17328	Gino	144	" She will be quite pleased . "
17348	17356	17341	17344	The dashing young fellow	696	" Of course I was only joking . "
17357	17375	17110	17110	he	151	" I know . But she wants me to take my friends . Come now ! Waiter ! "
17376	17382	17384	17385	the other	470	" If I do come , "
17387	17401	17384	17385	the other	470	" and take tea with you , this bill must be my affair . "
17402	17412	17110	17110	he	151	" Certainly not ; you are in my country ! "
17588	17594	17595	17595	she	100	" Do you like music ? "
17598	17601	17602	17602	he	144	" Passionately , "
17605	17622	17602	17602	he	144	" I have not studied scientific music , but the music of the heart , yes . "
17694	17730	17679	17679	he	144	" I think you are quite right . I shall not bring people to the house any more . I do not see why an English wife should be treated differently . This is Italy . "
17731	17737	17739	17740	the other	470	" You are very wise , "
17742	17760	17739	17740	the other	470	" very wise indeed . The more precious a possession the more carefully it should be guarded . "
17803	17814	17820	17820	Lilia	100	" yesterday I was happy , today I am not . "
17878	17881	17873	17873	he	1962	" business , "
18093	18101	18102	18102	she	100	" I do n't call this country , "
18106	18118	18102	18102	she	100	" Why , it 's not as wild as Sawston Park ! "
18231	18235	18228	18228	she	100	" married properly , "
18287	18292	18283	18283	she	100	" Santa Deodata 's . "
18439	18442	18415	18416	Miss Abbott	107	" do , "
18795	18803	18883	18883	He	144	" I always do it in England . "
18804	18809	18883	18883	He	144	" This is Italy . "
18810	18825	18883	18883	He	144	" Yes , but I 'm older than you , and I 'll settle . "
18826	18832	18833	18833	he	144	" I am your husband , "
18874	18882	18864	18864	Lilia	100	" And I 've got the money . "
18908	18917	18918	18918	she	100	" And you 'd better mend your manners , "
18921	18934	18918	18918	she	100	" for you 'd find it awkward if I stopped drawing cheques . "
18955	18975	18949	18949	she	100	" None of his clothes seemed to fit - too big in one place , too small in another . "
19084	19089	19091	19091	Lilia	100	" What has happened ? "
19096	19103	19091	19091	Lilia	100	" He is ill - ill . "
19113	19121	19122	19122	She	100	" What did you say to him ? "
19126	19130	19132	19132	Lilia	100	" Hardly anything , "
19203	19209	19185	19185	he	144	" It was not I , "
19769	19772	19773	19773	she	100	" Perhaps , "
19776	19794	19773	19773	she	100	" if I have a child he will be different . I know he wants a son . "
19965	19996	19962	19962	his	144	" Ah , one ought to marry ! Spiridione is wrong ; I must persuade him . Not till marriage does one realize the pleasures and the possibilities of life . "
20546	20550	20551	20551	she	150	" Non vengo ! "
20581	20584	20574	20574	she	150	" Vengo ... "
20600	20605	20585	20585	Her	150	" Vengo ! Vengo ! "
20790	20796	20797	20797	she	150	" What shall I do ? "
20800	20807	20797	20797	she	150	" He will be so angry . "
21065	21069	21071	21071	Lilia	100	" You laugh ? "
21073	21076	21077	21077	he	144	" Ah ! "
21080	21116	21077	21077	he	144	" who could help it ? I , who thought you knew and saw nothing - I am tricked - I am conquered . I give in . Let us talk of it no more . "
21155	21161	21162	21162	she	150	" What courage you have ! "
21165	21182	21162	21162	she	150	" and what good fortune ! He is angry no longer ! He has forgiven you ! "
21520	21580	21512	21512	she	100	" Irma , darling Irma , this letter is for you . I almost forgot I have a daughter . It will make you unhappy , but I want you to know everything , and you can not learn things too soon . God bless you , my dearest , and save you . God bless your miserable mother . "
21645	21650	21652	21653	her husband	1962	" Gently ! gently ! "
21687	21692	21693	21693	She	100	" It 's nothing . "
21715	21721	21693	21693	She	100	" Come and save me . "
21949	21953	21954	21954	He	144	" I continue . "
22017	22021	22022	22022	he	144	" My love ! "
22026	22043	22022	22022	he	144	" my dearest Lilia ! Be calm . I have never loved any one but you . "
22077	22087	22068	22068	he	144	" I have prayed all night for a boy . "
22100	22109	22096	22096	she	100	" You are a boy yourself , Gino . "
22113	22120	22110	22110	He	144	" Then we shall be brothers . "
22169	22176	22163	22164	some one	1989	" It is a beautiful boy ! "
22368	22387	22362	22362	he	172	" It is a weak face . I shall never carve a place for myself in the world . "
22864	22876	22877	22877	She	104	" Are we to go into mourning , do you think ? "
22915	22963	22904	22904	she	104	" After all she has suffered . That letter kept me awake for nights . The whole thing is like one of those horrible modern plays where no one is in ' the right . ' But if we have mourning , it will mean telling Irma . "
22964	22972	22974	22974	Philip	172	" Of course we must tell Irma ! "
22976	22980	22982	22983	his mother	307	" Of course , "
22985	23000	22982	22983	his mother	307	" But I think we can still not tell her about Lilia 's marriage . "
23001	23017	22904	22904	she	104	" I do n't think that . And she must have suspected something by now . "
23018	23123	22982	22983	his mother	307	" So one would have supposed . But she never cared for her mother , and little girls of nine do n't reason clearly . She looks on it as a long visit . And it is important , most important , that she should not receive a shock . All a child 's life depends on the ideal it has of its parents . Destroy that and everything goes - morals , behaviour , everything . Absolute trust in some one else is the essence of education . That is why I have been so careful about talking of poor Lilia before her . "
23124	23142	22904	22904	she	104	" But you forget this wretched baby . Waters and Adamson write that there is a baby . "
23143	23189	22982	22983	his mother	307	" Mrs. Theobald must be told . But she does n't count . She is breaking up very quickly . She does n't even see Mr. Kingcroft now . He , thank goodness , I hear , has at last consoled himself with someone else . "
23190	23198	23200	23200	Philip	172	" The child must know some time , "
23216	23228	22982	22983	his mother	307	" The later the better . Every moment she is developing . "
23229	23243	22982	22983	his mother	307	" I must say it seems rather hard luck , does n't it ? "
23244	23250	22982	22983	his mother	307	" On Irma ? Why ? "
23251	23275	22982	22983	his mother	307	" On us , perhaps . We have morals and behaviour also , and I do n't think this continual secrecy improves them . "
23276	23289	23291	23291	Harriet	102	" There 's no need to twist the thing round to that , "
23296	23303	23305	23306	her mother	270	" Of course there is n't , "
23308	23339	23305	23306	her mother	270	" Let 's keep to the main issue . This baby 's quite beside the point . Mrs. Theobald will do nothing , and it 's no concern of ours . "
23340	23352	23354	23354	he	172	" It will make a difference in the money , surely , "
23356	23390	23305	23306	her mother	270	" No , dear ; very little . Poor Charles provided for every kind of contingency in his will . The money will come to you and Harriet , as Irma 's guardians . "
23391	23400	23305	23306	her mother	270	" Good . Does the Italian get anything ? "
23401	23415	23305	23306	her mother	270	" He will get all hers . But you know what that is . "
23416	23438	23305	23306	her mother	270	" Good . So those are our tactics - to tell no one about the baby , not even Miss Abbott . "
23439	23448	23450	23451	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Most certainly this is the proper course , "
23454	23456	23305	23306	her mother	270	" course "
23458	23460	23305	23306	her mother	270	" tactics "
23466	23475	23305	23306	her mother	270	" And why ever should we tell Caroline ? "
23476	23486	23305	23306	her mother	270	" She was so mixed up in the affair . "
23487	23576	23305	23306	her mother	270	" Poor silly creature . The less she hears about it the better she will be pleased . I have come to be very sorry for Caroline . She , if any one , has suffered and been penitent . She burst into tears when I told her a little , only a little , of that terrible letter . I never saw such genuine remorse . We must forgive her and forget . Let the dead bury their dead . We will not trouble her with them . "
23595	23621	23580	23581	his mother	307	" Here beginneth the New Life , then . Do you remember , mother , that was what we said when we saw Lilia off ? "
23622	23674	23305	23306	her mother	270	" Yes , dear ; but now it is really a New Life , because we are all at accord . Then you were still infatuated with Italy . It may be full of beautiful pictures and churches , but we can not judge a country by anything but its men . "
23675	23681	23682	23682	he	172	" That is quite true , "
23815	23820	23822	23823	Mrs. Herriton	104	" As for Caroline , "
23825	23873	23822	23823	Mrs. Herriton	104	" I was almost frightened . She broke down utterly . She cried even when she left the house . I comforted her as best I could , and I kissed her . It is something that the breach between her and ourselves is now entirely healed . "
23874	23893	23975	23976	His mother	307	" Did she ask no questions - as to the nature of Lilia 's death , I mean ? "
23894	23974	23822	23823	Mrs. Herriton	104	" She did . But she has a mind of extraordinary delicacy . She saw that I was reticent , and she did not press me . You see , Philip , I can say to you what I could not say before Harriet . Her ideas are so crude . Really we do not want it known in Sawston that there is a baby . All peace and comfort would be lost if people came inquiring after it . "
24144	24166	24133	24133	she	107	" It is all so strange as well as so tragic . And what I did was as strange as anything . "
24181	24185	24186	24186	he	172	" Never mind , "
24189	24211	24186	24186	he	172	" It 's all over now . Let the dead bury their dead . It 's fallen out of our lives . "
24212	24255	24172	24172	she	107	" But that 's why I can talk about it and tell you everything I have always wanted to . You thought me stupid and sentimental and wicked and mad , but you never really knew how much I was to blame . "
24256	24265	24267	24267	Philip	172	" Indeed I never think about it now , "
24293	24302	24303	24303	she	107	" The first evening we got to Monteriano , "
24306	24377	24303	24303	she	107	" Lilia went out for a walk alone , saw that Italian in a picturesque position on a wall , and fell in love . He was shabbily dressed , and she did not even know he was the son of a dentist . I must tell you I was used to this sort of thing . Once or twice before I had had to send people about their business . "
24378	24386	24388	24388	Philip	172	" Yes ; we counted on you , "
24410	24416	24417	24417	she	107	" I know you did , "
24423	24510	24417	24417	she	107	" Lilia saw him several times again , and I knew I ought to interfere . I called her to my bedroom one night . She was very frightened , for she knew what it was about and how severe I could be . ' Do you love this man ? ' I asked . ' Yes or no ? ' She said ' Yes . ' And I said , ' Why do n't you marry him if you think you 'll be happy ? ' "
24511	24516	24518	24518	Philip	172	" Really - really , "
24530	24554	24518	24518	Philip	172	" You knew Lilia all your life . Apart from everything else - as if she could choose what could make her happy ! "
24555	24563	24564	24564	she	895	" Had you ever let her choose ? "
24568	24576	24577	24577	she	895	" I 'm afraid that 's rude , "
24585	24593	24595	24595	Philip	172	" Let us rather say unhappily expressed , "
24609	24640	24656	24656	her	895	" I want to finish . Next morning I found Signor Carella and said the same to him . He - well , he was willing . That 's all . "
24641	24646	24647	24647	He	172	" And the telegram ? "
24678	24757	24656	24656	her	895	" Ah , the telegram ! That was wrong . Lilia there was more cowardly than I was . We should have told the truth . It lost me my nerve , at all events . I came to the station meaning to tell you everything then . But we had started with a lie , and I got frightened . And at the end , when you left , I got frightened again and came with you . "
24758	24766	24656	24656	her	895	" Did you really mean to stop ? "
24767	24776	24656	24656	her	895	" For a time , at all events . "
24777	24787	24656	24656	her	895	" Would that have suited a newly married pair ? "
24788	24817	24656	24656	her	895	" It would have suited them . Lilia needed me . And as for him - I ca n't help feeling I might have got influence over him . "
24818	24826	24828	24828	Philip	172	" I am ignorant of these matters , "
24830	24846	24828	24828	Philip	172	" but I should have thought that would have increased the difficulty of the situation . "
24869	24876	24855	24855	She	896	" Well , I have explained . "
24877	24900	24901	24901	He	172	" But pardon me , Miss Abbott ; of most of your conduct you have given a description rather than an explanation . "
24925	24941	24919	24919	she	896	" An explanation may bore you , Mr. Herriton : it drags in other topics . "
24942	24948	24901	24901	He	172	" Oh , never mind . "
24949	24957	24919	24919	she	896	" I hated Sawston , you see . "
24962	24975	24958	24958	He	172	" So did and do I. That 's splendid . Go on . "
24976	24992	24901	24901	He	172	" I hated the idleness , the stupidity , the respectability , the petty unselfishness . "
24993	24997	24998	24998	he	172	" Petty selfishness , "
25009	25013	25014	25014	she	896	" Petty unselfishness , "
25017	25084	25014	25014	she	896	" I had got an idea that every one here spent their lives in making little sacrifices for objects they did n't care for , to please people they did n't love ; that they never learnt to be sincere - and , what 's as bad , never learnt how to enjoy themselves . That 's what I thought - what I thought at Monteriano . "
25085	25091	25092	25092	he	172	" Why , Miss Abbott , "
25095	25117	25092	25092	he	172	" you should have told me this before ! Think it still ! I agree with lots of it . Magnificent ! "
25118	25122	25123	25123	she	896	" Now Lilia , "
25127	25353	25123	25123	she	896	" though there were things about her I did n't like , had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity . And Gino , I thought , was splendid , and young , and strong not only in body , and sincere as the day . If they wanted to marry , why should n't they do so ? Why should n't she break with the deadening life where she had got into a groove , and would go on in it , getting more and more - worse than unhappy - apathetic till she died ? Of course I was wrong . She only changed one groove for another - a worse groove . And as for him - well , you know more about him than I do . I can never trust myself to judge characters again . But I still feel he can not have been quite bad when we first met him . Lilia - that I should dare to say it ! - must have been cowardly . He was only a boy - just going to turn into something fine , I thought - and she must have mismanaged him . So that is the one time I have gone against what is proper , and there are the results . You have an explanation now . "
25354	25383	25092	25092	he	172	" And much of it has been most interesting , though I do n't understand everything . Did you never think of the disparity of their social position ? "
25384	25412	25123	25123	she	896	" We were mad - drunk with rebellion . We had no common - sense . As soon as you came , you saw and foresaw everything . "
25413	25422	25423	25423	He	898	" Oh , I do n't think that . "
25449	25455	25456	25456	she	107	" I hope you see , "
25459	25637	25456	25456	she	107	" why I have troubled you with this long story . Women - I heard you say the other day - are never at ease till they tell their faults out loud . Lilia is dead and her husband gone to the bad - all through me . You see , Mr. Herriton , it makes me specially unhappy ; it 's the only time I 've ever gone into what my father calls ' real life ' - and look what I 've made of it ! All that winter I seemed to be waking up to beauty and splendour and I do n't know what ; and when the spring came , I wanted to fight against the things I hated - mediocrity and dulness and spitefulness and society . I actually hated society for a day or two at Monteriano . I did n't see that all these things are invincible , and that if we go against them they will break us to pieces . Thank you for listening to so much nonsense . "
25638	25649	25651	25651	Philip	172	" Oh , I quite sympathize with what you say , "
25654	25753	25651	25651	Philip	172	" it is n't nonsense , and a year or two ago I should have been saying it too . But I feel differently now , and I hope that you also will change . Society is invincible - to a certain degree . But your real life is your own , and nothing can touch it . There is no power on earth that can prevent your criticizing and despising mediocrity - nothing that can stop you retreating into splendour and beauty - into the thoughts and beliefs that make the real life - the real you . "
25754	25774	25776	25776	she	899	" I have never had that experience yet . Surely I and my life must be where I live . "
25802	25812	25813	25813	he	172	" There is another great consolation against invincible mediocrity , "
25816	25841	25813	25813	he	172	" the meeting a fellow - victim . I hope that this is only the first of many discussions that we shall have together . "
26046	26051	26053	26054	her aunt	906	" How dare you ! "
26056	26065	26053	26054	her aunt	906	" You wicked girl ! Give it here ! "
26096	26110	26092	26092	she	103	" View of the superb city of Monteriano - from your lital brother . "
26139	26169	26129	26129	Irma	103	" Who is my little brother ? Why have I never heard of him before ? Grandmamma ! Grandmamma ! Who is my little brother ? Who is my - "
26179	26201	26170	26171	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Come with me , dear , and I will tell you . Now it is time for you to know . "
26260	26264	26265	26265	she	104	" Aunt Harriet ! "
26269	26333	26265	26265	she	104	" Uncle Phil ! Grandmamma ! What do you suppose my little brother is doing now ? Has he begun to play ? Do Italian babies talk sooner than us , or would he be an English baby born abroad ? Oh , I do long to see him , and be the first to teach him the Ten Commandments and the Catechism . "
26343	26346	26348	26349	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Really , "
26351	26365	26348	26349	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Irma is getting too tiresome . She forgot poor Lilia soon enough . "
26366	26379	26381	26381	Philip	172	" A living brother is more to her than a dead mother , "
26384	26391	26381	26381	Philip	172	" She can knit him socks . "
26392	26429	26348	26349	Mrs. Herriton	104	" I stopped that . She is bringing him in everywhere . It is most vexatious . The other night she asked if she might include him in the people she mentions specially in her prayers . "
26430	26436	26381	26381	Philip	172	" What did you say ? "
26437	26444	26445	26445	she	911	" Of course I allowed her , "
26449	26478	26445	26445	she	911	" She has a right to mention any one she chooses . But I was annoyed with her this morning , and I fear that I showed it . "
26479	26486	26381	26381	Philip	172	" And what happened this morning ? "
26487	26505	26445	26445	she	911	" She asked if she could pray for her ' new father ' - for the Italian ! "
26506	26512	26381	26381	Philip	172	" Did you let her ? "
26513	26521	26445	26445	she	911	" I got up without saying anything . "
26522	26540	26381	26381	Philip	172	" You must have felt just as you did when I wanted to pray for the devil . "
26541	26547	26549	26549	Harriet	102	" He is the devil , "
26551	26561	26549	26549	Harriet	102	" No , Harriet ; he is too vulgar . "
26562	26573	26575	26575	Harriet	102	" I will thank you not to scoff against religion ! "
26579	26604	26575	26575	Harriet	102	" Think of that poor baby . Irma is right to pray for him . What an entrance into life for an English child ! "
26605	26643	26549	26549	Harriet	102	" My dear sister , I can reassure you . Firstly , the beastly baby is Italian . Secondly , it was promptly christened at Santa Deodata 's , and a powerful combination of saints watch over - "
26644	26686	26575	26575	Harriet	102	" Do n't , dear . And , Harriet , do n't be so serious - I mean not so serious when you are with Irma . She will be worse than ever if she thinks we have something to hide . "
26771	26777	26779	26780	Mrs. Herriton	104	" I can not think , "
26782	26791	26779	26780	Mrs. Herriton	104	" what his motive is in sending them . "
26824	26844	26897	26897	She	104	" Do you suppose that he guesses the situation - how anxious we are to hush the scandal up ? "
26845	26874	26897	26897	She	104	" That is quite possible . He knows that Irma will worry us about the baby . Perhaps he hopes that we shall adopt it to quiet her . "
26875	26879	26897	26897	She	104	" Hopeful indeed . "
26880	26896	26897	26897	She	104	" At the same time he has the chance of corrupting the child 's morals . "
26914	26924	26926	26926	her	104	" He entreats her to send the baby one , "
26930	26937	26897	26897	She	104	" She might do it too ! "
26938	26962	26897	26897	She	104	" I told her not to ; but we must watch her carefully , without , of course , appearing to be suspicious . "
26986	27004	26897	26897	She	104	" Who 's to watch her at school , though ? She may bubble out any moment . "
27005	27014	27016	27017	Mrs. Herriton	104	" We can but trust to our influence , "
27229	27238	27239	27240	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Yes , it is all very sad , "
27244	27317	27239	27240	Mrs. Herriton	104	" My daughter - in - law made a very unhappy marriage , as I dare say you know . I suppose that the child will be educated in Italy . Possibly his grandmother may be doing something , but I have not heard of it . I do not expect that she will have him over . She disapproves of the father . It is altogether a painful business for her . "
27500	27508	27510	27511	Mrs. Herriton	104	" I dare say you have heard , "
27520	27538	27510	27511	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Yes , I have . I came to ask you ; have any steps been taken ? "
27569	27574	27576	27577	Mrs. Herriton	104	" About the baby ? "
27580	27583	27647	27648	His mother	307	" Yes . "
27584	27610	27647	27648	His mother	307	" As far as I know , no steps . Mrs. Theobald may have decided on something , but I have not heard of it . "
27611	27622	27647	27648	His mother	307	" I was meaning , had you decided on anything ? "
27623	27632	27634	27634	Philip	172	" The child is no relation of ours , "
27636	27646	27634	27634	Philip	172	" It is therefore scarcely for us to interfere . "
27654	27687	27647	27648	His mother	307	" Poor Lilia was almost a daughter to me once . I know what Miss Abbott means . But now things have altered . Any initiative would naturally come from Mrs. Theobald . "
27688	27701	27703	27704	Miss Abbott	107	" But does not Mrs. Theobald always take any initiative from you ? "
27713	27733	27706	27707	Mrs. Herriton	104	" I sometimes have given her advice in the past . I should not presume to do so now . "
27734	27747	27647	27648	His mother	307	" Then is nothing to be done for the child at all ? "
27748	27761	27763	27763	Philip	172	" It is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest , "
27765	27776	27778	27779	Miss Abbott	107	" The child came into the world through my negligence , "
27781	27793	27778	27779	Miss Abbott	107	" It is natural I should take an interest in it . "
27794	27799	27801	27802	Mrs. Herriton	104	" My dear Caroline , "
27804	27842	27801	27802	Mrs. Herriton	104	" you must not brood over the thing . Let bygones be bygones . The child should worry you even less than it worries us . We never even mention it . It belongs to another world . "
27862	27866	27867	27867	she	107	" Of course , "
27870	27917	27867	27867	she	107	" if Mrs. Theobald decides on any plan that seems at all practicable - I must say I do n't see any such - I shall ask if I may join her in it , for Irma 's sake , and share in any possible expenses . "
27918	27939	27980	27981	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Please would you let me know if she decides on anything . I should like to join as well . "
27940	27957	27867	27867	she	107	" My dear , how you throw about your money ! We would never allow it . "
27958	27979	27980	27981	Mrs. Herriton	104	" And if she decides on nothing , please also let me know . Let me know in any case . "
27989	27996	28003	28003	she	104	" Is the young person mad ? "
28007	28034	28003	28003	she	104	" Never in my life have I seen such colossal impertinence . She ought to be well smacked , and sent back to Sunday - school . "
28040	28157	28035	28036	His mother	307	" But do n't you see - she is practically threatening us ? You ca n't put her off with Mrs. Theobald ; she knows as well as we do that she is a nonentity . If we do n't do anything she 's going to raise a scandal - that we neglect our relatives , c. , which is , of course , a lie . Still she 'll say it . Oh , dear , sweet , sober Caroline Abbott has a screw loose ! We knew it at Monteriano . I had my suspicions last year one day in the train ; and here it is again . The young person is mad . "
28163	28182	28194	28194	she	944	" Shall I go round at once and give it her well ? I 'd really enjoy it . "
28207	28241	28203	28204	Mrs. Herriton	104	" Caroline has been extremely impertinent . Yet there may be something in what she says after all . Ought the child to grow up in that place - and with that father ? "
28273	28279	28280	28280	she	944	" Let us admit frankly , "
28283	28292	28280	28280	she	944	" that after all we may have responsibilities . "
28293	28314	28335	28336	Mrs. Herriton	104	" I do n't understand you , Mother . You are turning absolutely round . What are you up to ? "
28359	28380	28354	28354	His	945	" Up to ? I am wondering whether I ought not to adopt the child . Is that sufficiently plain ? "
28381	28398	28342	28342	her	104	" And this is the result of half - a - dozen idiocies of Miss Abbott ? "
28399	28461	28354	28354	His	945	" It is . I repeat , she has been extremely impertinent . None the less she is showing me my duty . If I can rescue poor Lilia 's baby from that horrible man , who will bring it up either as Papist or infidel - who will certainly bring it up to be vicious - I shall do it . "
28462	28468	28342	28342	her	104	" You talk like Harriet . "
28469	28474	28476	28476	she	104	" And why not ? "
28488	28535	28476	28476	she	104	" Say , if you choose , that I talk like Irma . That child has seen the thing more clearly than any of us . She longs for her little brother . She shall have him . I do n't care if I am impulsive . "
28801	28810	28811	28811	she	107	" I am planning what can be done , "
28816	28881	28811	28811	she	107	" and that kind Caroline Abbott is helping me . It is no business of either of us , but we are getting to feel that the baby must not be left entirely to that horrible man . It would be unfair to little Irma ; after all , he is her half - brother . No , we have come to nothing definite . "
29111	29119	29120	29120	she	107	" What do you think of it ? "
29125	29141	29120	29120	she	107	" It would not do to let him know that we are anxious for it . "
29142	29150	29120	29120	she	107	" Certainly he will never suppose that . "
29151	29162	29120	29120	she	107	" But what effect will the letter have on him ? "
29163	29218	29120	29120	she	107	" When he gets it he will do a sum . If it is less expensive in the long run to part with a little money and to be clear of the baby , he will part with it . If he would lose , he will adopt the tone of the loving father . "
29219	29227	29120	29120	she	107	" Dear , you 're shockingly cynical . "
29234	29242	29231	29231	she	107	" How would the sum work out ? "
29243	29336	29337	29337	He	968	" I do n't know , I 'm sure . But if you wanted to ensure the baby being posted by return , you should have sent a little sum to HIM . Oh , I 'm not cynical - at least I only go by what I know of him . But I am weary of the whole show . Weary of Italy . Weary , weary , weary . Sawston 's a kind , pitiful place , is n't it ? I will go walk in it and seek comfort . "
29421	29432	29434	29435	Mr. Abbott	128	" Very fine of Mrs. Herriton , very fine indeed , "
29453	29475	29434	29435	Mr. Abbott	128	" I 'm afraid it will mean a lot of expense . She will get nothing out of Italy without paying . "
29476	29485	29487	29487	Philip	172	" There are sure to be incidental expenses , "
29499	29511	29491	29491	he	172	" Do you suppose we shall have difficulty with the man ? "
29512	29516	29517	29517	she	107	" It depends , "
29524	29543	29434	29435	Mr. Abbott	128	" From what you saw of him , should you conclude that he would make an affectionate parent ? "
29544	29564	29491	29491	he	172	" I do n't go by what I saw of him , but by what I know of him . "
29565	29575	29434	29435	Mr. Abbott	128	" Well , what do you conclude from that ? "
29576	29585	29491	29491	he	172	" That he is a thoroughly wicked man . "
29586	29604	29434	29435	Mr. Abbott	128	" Yet thoroughly wicked men have loved their children . Look at Rodrigo Borgia , for example . "
29605	29617	29491	29491	he	172	" I have also seen examples of that in my district . "
29754	29759	29760	29760	he	172	" She fences well , "
29767	29775	29776	29776	she	307	" What had you to fence about ? "
29845	29850	29851	29851	she	307	" Read the letters , "
29854	29859	29851	29851	she	307	" We have failed . "
29878	29881	29851	29851	she	307	" Preghiatissima Signora "
29885	29890	29851	29851	she	307	" Most Praiseworthy Madam , "
29952	29971	29945	29945	he	172	" ; he also had addressed letters - who writes at home ? - from the Caffe Garibaldi . "
29983	29987	29976	29976	I	0	" he thought . "
30015	30015	30004	30005	a bounder	982	"
30016	30022	30024	30025	his mother	307	" Is n't it disheartening ? "
30108	30116	30118	30118	Philip	172	" The sum works out against us , "
30120	30130	30118	30118	Philip	172	" Or perhaps he is putting up the price . "
30131	30134	30136	30137	Mrs. Herriton	104	" No , "
30140	30172	30136	30137	Mrs. Herriton	104	" It is not that . For some perverse reason he will not part with the child . I must go and tell poor Caroline . She will be equally distressed . "
30202	30206	30207	30207	she	104	" The impudence ! "
30210	30255	30207	30207	she	104	" The cursed impudence ! Oh , I 'm swearing . I do n't care . That beastly woman - how dare she interfere - I 'll - Philip , dear , I 'm sorry . It 's no good . You must go . "
30256	30268	30274	30274	his	987	" Go where ? Do sit down . What 's happened ? "
30292	30312	30207	30207	she	104	" She wo n't accept - wo n't accept the letter as final . You must go to Monteriano ! "
30313	30318	30319	30319	he	987	" I wo n't ! "
30323	30344	30319	30319	he	987	" I 've been and I 've failed . I 'll never see the place again . I hate Italy . "
30345	30355	30207	30207	she	104	" If you do n't go , she will . "
30356	30359	30319	30319	he	987	" Abbott ? "
30360	30463	30207	30207	she	104	" Yes . Going alone ; would start this evening . I offered to write ; she said it was ' too late ! ' Too late ! The child , if you please - Irma 's brother - to live with her , to be brought up by her and her father at our very gates , to go to school like a gentleman , she paying . Oh , you 're a man ! It does n't matter for you . You can laugh . But I know what people say ; and that woman goes to Italy this evening . "
30470	30498	30464	30464	He	989	" Then let her go ! Let her mess with Italy by herself . She 'll come to grief somehow . Italy 's too dangerous , too - "
30499	30533	30319	30319	he	987	" Stop that nonsense , Philip . I will not be disgraced by her . I WILL have the child . Pay all we 've got for it . I will have it . "
30534	30541	30542	30542	he	989	" Let her go to Italy ! "
30545	30617	30542	30542	he	989	" Let her meddle with what she does n't understand ! Look at this letter ! The man who wrote it will marry her , or murder her , or do for her somehow . He 's a bounder , but he 's not an English bounder . He 's mysterious and terrible . He 's got a country behind him that 's upset people from the beginning of the world . "
30618	30621	30623	30624	his mother	307	" Harriet ! "
30626	30640	30623	30624	his mother	307	" Harriet shall go too . Harriet , now , will be invaluable ! "
30767	30775	30776	30776	she	307	" It upsets one 's plans terribly , "
30786	30794	30780	30780	she	307	" but obviously it is my duty . "
30795	30804	30806	30806	Philip	172	" Did mother explain it all to you ? "
30808	30902	30780	30780	she	307	" Yes , indeed ! Mother has written me a really beautiful letter . She describes how it was that she gradually got to feel that we must rescue the poor baby from its terrible surroundings , how she has tried by letter , and it is no good - nothing but insincere compliments and hypocrisy came back . Then she says , ' There is nothing like personal influence ; you and Philip will succeed where I have failed . ' She says , too , that Caroline Abbott has been wonderful . "
30906	30979	30780	30780	she	307	" Caroline feels it as keenly almost as us . That is because she knows the man . Oh , he must be loathsome ! Goodness me ! I 've forgotten to pack the ammonia ! ... It has been a terrible lesson for Caroline , but I fancy it is her turning - point . I ca n't help liking to think that out of all this evil good will come . "
31168	31177	31179	31179	Philip	172	" Absurd nonsense they talk about the heat , "
31188	31204	31179	31179	Philip	172	" Supposing we were here for pleasure , what could be more pleasurable than this ? "
31205	31219	31221	31221	Harriet	102	" Did you hear , though , they are remarking on the cold ? "
31224	31233	31221	31221	Harriet	102	" I should never have thought it cold . "
31382	31387	31389	31389	Harriet	102	" What a religion ! "
31478	31485	31487	31487	Harriet	102	" Foreigners are a filthy nation , "
31489	31503	31487	31487	Harriet	102	" I do n't care if there are tunnels ; open the windows . "
31598	31603	31605	31605	he	172	" Singles or returns ? "
31607	31613	31615	31615	Harriet	102	" A single for me , "
31618	31626	31615	31615	Harriet	102	" I shall never get back alive . "
31627	31631	31633	31634	her brother	1014	" Sweet creature ! "
31640	31653	31633	31634	her brother	1014	" How helpful you will be when we come to Signor Carella ! "
31654	31659	31661	31661	Harriet	102	" Do you suppose , "
31671	31685	31661	31661	Harriet	102	" do you suppose I am going to enter that man 's house ? "
31686	31699	31633	31634	her brother	1014	" Then what have you come for , pray ? For ornament ? "
31700	31709	31661	31661	Harriet	102	" To see that you do your duty . "
31710	31715	31633	31634	her brother	1014	" Oh , thanks ! "
31716	31743	31661	31661	Harriet	102	" So mother told me . For goodness sake get the tickets ; here comes that hot woman again ! She has the impudence to bow . "
31744	31752	31754	31754	Philip	172	" Mother told you , did she ? "
31952	31959	31961	31961	Harriet	102	" But do people live inside ? "
31998	32001	31991	31991	Philip	172	" No . "
32002	32009	32011	32011	Harriet	102	" What do they do there ? "
32017	32037	31991	31991	Philip	172	" There is a caffe . A prison . A theatre . A church . Walls . A view . "
32038	32046	32048	32048	Harriet	102	" Not for me , thank you , "
32055	32093	32095	32095	his	172	" Nobody asked you , Miss , you see . Now Lilia was asked by such a nice young gentleman , with curls all over his forehead , and teeth just as white as father makes them . "
32099	32119	32095	32095	his	172	" But , Harriet , do you see nothing wonderful or attractive in that place - nothing at all ? "
32120	32129	31991	31991	Philip	172	" Nothing at all . It 's frightful . "
32130	32144	32095	32095	his	172	" I know it is . But it 's old - awfully old . "
32145	32152	32154	32154	Harriet	102	" Beauty is the only test , "
32156	32181	32154	32154	Harriet	102	" At least so you told me when I sketched old buildings - for the sake , I suppose , of making yourself unpleasant . "
32182	32222	32095	32095	his	172	" Oh , I 'm perfectly right . But at the same time - I do n't know - so many things have happened here - people have lived so hard and so splendidly - I ca n't explain . "
32223	32283	32154	32154	Harriet	102	" I should n't think you could . It does n't seem the best moment to begin your Italy mania . I thought you were cured of it by now . Instead , will you kindly tell me what you are going to do when you arrive . I do beg you will not be taken unawares this time . "
32284	32339	32095	32095	his	172	" First , Harriet , I shall settle you at the Stella d'Italia , in the comfort that befits your sex and disposition . Then I shall make myself some tea . After tea I shall take a book into Santa Deodata 's , and read there . It is always fresh and cool . "
32345	32379	32340	32342	The martyred Harriet	102	" I 'm not clever , Philip . I do n't go in for it , as you know . But I know what 's rude . And I know what 's wrong . "
32380	32384	32154	32154	Harriet	102	" Meaning - ? "
32385	32388	32389	32389	she	102	" You ! "
32405	32420	32389	32389	she	102	" What 's the good of cleverness if a man 's murdered a woman ? "
32421	32434	32154	32154	Harriet	102	" Harriet , I am hot . To whom do you refer ? "
32435	32456	32389	32389	she	102	" He . Her . If you do n't look out he 'll murder you . I wish he would . "
32457	32471	32473	32473	he	1030	" Tut tut , tutlet ! You 'd find a corpse extraordinarily inconvenient . "
32480	32514	32473	32473	he	1030	" I heartily dislike the fellow , but we know he did n't murder her . In that letter , though she said a lot , she never said he was physically cruel . "
32515	32533	32389	32389	she	102	" He has murdered her . The things he did - things one ca n't even mention - "
32534	32580	32581	32581	He	1030	" Things which one must mention if one 's to talk at all . And things which one must keep in their proper place . Because he was unfaithful to his wife , it does n't follow that in every way he 's absolutely vile . "
32594	32610	32389	32389	she	102	" It 's the supreme test . The man who is unchivalrous to a woman - "
32611	32658	32587	32587	It	460	" Oh , stow it ! Take it to the Back Kitchen . It 's no more a supreme test than anything else . The Italians never were chivalrous from the first . If you condemn him for that , you 'll condemn the whole lot . "
32659	32666	32389	32389	she	102	" I condemn the whole lot . "
32667	32674	32587	32587	It	460	" And the French as well ? "
32675	32682	32389	32389	she	102	" And the French as well . "
32683	32691	32693	32693	Philip	172	" Things are n't so jolly easy , "
32722	32808	32714	32714	she	1032	" What about the baby , pray ? You 've said a lot of smart things and whittled away morality and religion and I do n't know what ; but what about the baby ? You think me a fool , but I 've been noticing you all today , and you have n't mentioned the baby once . You have n't thought about it , even . You do n't care . Philip ! I shall not speak to you . You are intolerable . "
33493	33496	33489	33489	Harriet	102	" Go ! "
33497	33501	33503	33503	Philip	172	" Go where ? "
33517	33524	33489	33489	Harriet	102	" To the Italian . Go . "
33525	33538	33489	33489	Harriet	102	" Buona sera , signora padrona . Si ritorna volontieri a Monteriano ! "
33559	33564	33551	33551	You	1080	" Vorrei due camere - "
33565	33582	33489	33489	Harriet	102	" Go . This instant . Now . I 'll stand it no longer . Go ! "
33583	33597	33551	33551	You	1080	" I 'm damned if I 'll go . I want my tea . "
33598	33604	33605	33605	she	102	" Swear if you like ! "
33608	33622	33605	33605	she	102	" Blaspheme ! Abuse me ! But understand , I 'm in earnest . "
33623	33634	33551	33551	You	1080	" Harriet , do n't act . Or act better . "
33635	33679	33605	33605	she	102	" We 've come here to get the baby back , and for nothing else . I 'll not have this levity and slackness , and talk about pictures and churches . Think of mother ; did she send you out for THEM ? "
33680	33710	33551	33551	You	1080	" Think of mother and do n't straddle across the stairs . Let the cabman and the landlady come down , and let me go up and choose rooms . "
33711	33716	33605	33605	she	102	" I sha n't . "
33717	33724	33551	33551	You	1080	" Harriet , are you mad ? "
33725	33743	33605	33605	she	102	" If you like . But you will not come up till you have seen the Italian . "
33744	33751	33753	33753	Philip	172	" La signorina si sente male , "
33755	33762	33753	33753	Philip	172	" C ' e il sole . "
33763	33766	33768	33769	the landlady	476	" Poveretta ! "
33774	33779	33781	33781	Harriet	102	" Leave me alone ! "
33788	33819	33781	33781	Harriet	102	" I do n't care for the lot of you . I 'm English , and neither you 'll come down nor he up till he goes for the baby . "
33820	33837	33768	33769	the landlady	476	" La prego - piano - piano - c e un ' altra signorina che dorme - "
33838	33859	33781	33781	Harriet	102	" We shall probably be arrested for brawling , Harriet . Have you the very slightest sense of the ludicrous ? "
34038	34048	34055	34055	she	102	" You , Caroline , here of all people ! "
34074	34117	34069	34069	Philip	172	" You will have a lot to tell Miss Abbott , Harriet , and she may have as much to tell you . So I 'll pay my call on Signor Carella , as you suggested , and see how things stand . "
34152	34160	34161	34161	he	172	" Tear each other 's eyes out ! "
34172	34210	34161	34161	he	172	" Give it to her , Harriet ! Teach her to leave us alone . Give it to her , Caroline ! Teach her to be grateful to you . Go it , ladies ; go it ! "
34391	34398	34399	34399	he	172	" Where does Signor Carella live ? "
34407	34413	34415	34417	a little girl	1101	" I 'll show you , "
34429	34435	34437	34439	the Dogana men	480	" She will show you , "
34444	34467	34437	34439	the Dogana men	480	" Follow her always , always , and you will come to no harm . She is a trustworthy guide . She is my
34470	34473	34474	34474	sister	376	" cousin . "
34476	34476	34474	34474	sister	376	"
34495	34507	34508	34508	he	172	" Do you chance to know whether Signor Carella is in ? "
34693	34698	34700	34701	the girl	1120	" That is Perfetta , "
34703	34711	34713	34713	Philip	172	" I want to see Signor Carella , "
34715	34718	34664	34664	her	1110	" Out ! "
34719	34722	34724	34725	the girl	1120	" Out , "
34728	34739	34740	34740	He	172	" Why on earth did you say he was in ? "
34781	34788	34789	34789	he	172	" When will he be back ? "
34905	34914	34915	34915	he	172	" I shall have to leave a message , "
34918	34927	34929	34931	the little girl	253	" Now Perfetta has gone for her basket , "
34933	34965	34929	34931	the little girl	253	" When she returns she will lower it - so . Then you will put your card into it . Then she will raise it - thus . By this means - "
35064	35069	35060	35060	She	100	" to hack about in "
35080	35086	35087	35087	He	172	" in Italy anything does . "
35095	35101	35103	35103	Perfetta	150	" Beautiful as an angel ! "
35115	35122	35103	35103	Perfetta	150	" But who am I addressing ? "
35123	35132	35133	35133	He	172	" Thank you - here is my card . "
35169	35185	35162	35162	he	172	" Has a young lady happened to call here lately - a young English lady ? "
35197	35208	35186	35186	Perfetta	150	" A young lady - pale , large , tall . "
35215	35220	35209	35209	She	253	" A YOUNG LADY ! "
35221	35229	35231	35234	the Dogana 's relative	1110	" Perfetta is deaf when she chooses , "
35375	35385	35386	35386	he	172	" I was going to make myself some tea , "
35397	35403	35386	35386	he	172	" I should be grateful - "
35418	35422	35423	35423	she	107	" You see , "
35426	35431	35423	35423	she	107	" Harriet knows nothing . "
35432	35441	35386	35386	he	172	" No more do I. He was out . "
35442	35452	35423	35423	she	107	" But what 's that to do with it ? "
35471	35487	35461	35461	She	107	" He was out . You find me as ignorant as you have left Harriet . "
35488	35566	35423	35423	she	107	" What do you mean ? Please , please Mr. Herriton , do n't be mysterious : there is n't the time . Any moment Harriet may be down , and we sha n't have decided how to behave to her . Sawston was different : we had to keep up appearances . But here we must speak out , and I think I can trust you to do it . Otherwise we 'll never start clear . "
35567	35574	35576	35576	Philip	172	" Pray let us start clear , "
35585	35609	35576	35576	Philip	172	" Permit me to begin by asking you a question . In which capacity have you come to Monteriano - spy or traitor ? "
35610	35613	35614	35614	she	1143	" Spy ! "
35664	35667	35668	35668	she	1143	" Spy , "
35689	35797	35668	35668	she	1143	" Your mother has behaved dishonourably all through . She never wanted the child ; no harm in that ; but she is too proud to let it come to me . She has done all she could to wreck things ; she did not tell you everything ; she has told Harriet nothing at all ; she has lied or acted lies everywhere . I can not trust your mother . So I have come here alone - all across Europe ; no one knows it ; my father thinks I am in Normandy - to spy on Mrs. Herriton . Do n't let 's argue ! "
35812	35842	35799	35799	he	1146	" If you are here to get the child , I will help you ; if you are here to fail , I shall get it instead of you . "
35843	35854	35855	35855	he	1146	" It is hopeless to expect you to believe me , "
35858	35927	35855	35855	he	1146	" But I can assert that we are here to get the child , even if it costs us all we 've got . My mother has fixed no money limit whatever . I am here to carry out her instructions . I think that you will approve of them , as you have practically dictated them . I do not approve of them . They are absurd . "
35952	35960	35961	35961	he	1146	" Harriet also carries out your instructions , "
35964	36016	35961	35961	he	1146	" She , however , approves of them , and does not know that they proceed from you . I think , Miss Abbott , you had better take entire charge of the rescue party . I have asked for an interview with Signor Carella tomorrow morning . Do you acquiesce ? "
36021	36040	36017	36017	She	1148	" Might I ask for details of your interview with him ? They might be helpful to me . "
36073	36084	36061	36061	Her	1148	" My interview - how do you know of it ? "
36085	36094	36017	36017	She	1148	" From Perfetta , if it interests you . "
36095	36101	36061	36061	Her	1148	" Who ever is Perfetta ? "
36102	36112	36017	36017	She	1148	" The woman who must have let you in . "
36113	36117	36061	36061	Her	1148	" In where ? "
36118	36125	36017	36017	She	1148	" Into Signor Carella 's house . "
36126	36130	36131	36131	she	1148	" Mr. Herriton ! "
36134	36213	36131	36131	she	1148	" How could you believe her ? Do you suppose that I would have entered that man 's house , knowing about him all that I do ? I think you have very odd ideas of what is possible for a lady . I hear you wanted Harriet to go . Very properly she refused . Eighteen months ago I might have done such a thing . But I trust I have learnt how to behave by now . "
36267	36283	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" I suppose I misunderstood Perfetta . Where did you have your interview , then ? "
36284	36388	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" Not an interview - an accident - I am very sorry - I meant you to have the chance of seeing him first . Though it is your fault . You are a day late . You were due here yesterday . So I came yesterday , and , not finding you , went up to the Rocca - you know that kitchen - garden where they let you in , and there is a ladder up to a broken tower , where you can stand and see all the other towers below you and the plain and all the other hills ? "
36389	36405	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" Yes , yes . I know the Rocca ; I told you of it . "
36406	36438	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" So I went up in the evening for the sunset : I had nothing to do . He was in the garden : it belongs to a friend of his . "
36439	36444	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" And you talked . "
36445	36497	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" It was very awkward for me . But I had to talk : he seemed to make me . You see he thought I was here as a tourist ; he thinks so still . He intended to be civil , and I judged it better to be civil also . "
36498	36506	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" And of what did you talk ? "
36507	36570	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" The weather - there will be rain , he says , by tomorrow evening - the other towns , England , myself , about you a little , and he actually mentioned Lilia . He was perfectly disgusting ; he pretended he loved her ; he offered to show me her grave - the grave of the woman he has murdered ! "
36571	36660	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" My dear Miss Abbott , he is not a murderer . I have just been driving that into Harriet . And when you know the Italians as well as I do , you will realize that in all that he said to you he was perfectly sincere . The Italians are essentially dramatic ; they look on death and love as spectacles . I do n't doubt that he persuaded himself , for the moment , that he had behaved admirably , both as husband and widower . "
36661	36667	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" You may be right , "
36678	36719	36669	36670	Miss Abbott	107	" When I tried to pave the way , so to speak - to hint that he had not behaved as he ought - well , it was no good at all . He could n't or would n't understand . "
36755	36766	36825	36825	Philip	172	" Harriet would say he has no sense of sin . "
36767	36777	36789	36790	Miss Abbott	107	" Harriet may be right , I am afraid . "
36778	36788	36825	36825	Philip	172	" If so , perhaps he is n't sinful ! "
36798	36806	36807	36807	she	107	" I know what he has done , "
36810	36824	36807	36807	she	107	" What he says and what he thinks is of very little importance . "
36831	36853	36825	36825	Philip	172	" I should like to hear , though , what he said about me . Is he preparing a warm reception ? "
36854	36904	36825	36825	Philip	172	" Oh , no , not that . I never told him that you and Harriet were coming . You could have taken him by surprise if you liked . He only asked for you , and wished he had n't been so rude to you eighteen months ago . "
36905	36916	36917	36917	He	172	" What a memory the fellow has for little things ! "
36967	36988	36960	36960	She	107	" You did not think it a little thing at the time . You told me he had assaulted you . "
36989	36995	36997	36997	Philip	172	" I lost my temper , "
37021	37032	36997	36997	Philip	172	" Did he really - what exactly did he say ? "
37033	37057	36997	36997	Philip	172	" He said he was sorry - pleasantly , as Italians do say such things . But he never mentioned the baby once . "
37193	37206	37207	37207	he	172	" The view from the Rocca small gratuity is finest at sunset , "
37217	37226	37227	37228	Miss Abbott	107	" And he never mentioned the baby once , "
37274	37286	37267	37267	She	107	" The view from the Rocca - was n't it fine ? "
37287	37294	37295	37295	she	107	" What is n't fine here ? "
37303	37310	37295	37295	she	107	" I wish I was Harriet , "
37319	37324	37295	37295	she	107	" Because Harriet - ? "
37391	37402	37387	37387	she	107	" Mr. Herriton - come here - look at this ! "
37602	37609	37611	37611	Philip	172	" It reaches up to heaven , "
37613	37621	37611	37611	Philip	172	" and down to the other place . "
37645	37656	37657	37657	She	1178	" Is it to be a symbol of the town ? "
37783	37793	37795	37796	Miss Abbott	107	" Surely that is n't an opera - bill ? "
37806	37823	37798	37798	Philip	172	" ' Lucia di Lammermoor . By the Master Donizetti . Unique representation . This evening . '
37824	37835	37795	37796	Miss Abbott	107	" But is there an opera ? Right up here ? "
37836	37909	37798	37798	Philip	172	" Why , yes . These people know how to live . They would sooner have a thing bad than not have it at all . That is why they have got to have so much that is good . However bad the performance is tonight , it will be alive . Italians do n't love music silently , like the beastly Germans . The audience takes its share - sometimes more . "
37910	37916	37795	37796	Miss Abbott	107	" Ca n't we go ? "
37926	37936	37917	37917	He	172	" But we 're here to rescue a child ! "
38152	38216	38120	38120	She	102	" You see him tomorrow at ten , Philip . Well , do n't forget the blank cheque . Say an hour for the business . No , Italians are so slow ; say two . Twelve o'clock . Lunch . Well - then it 's no good going till the evening train . I can manage the baby as far as Florence - "
38217	38247	38120	38120	She	102	" My dear sister , you ca n't run on like that . You do n't buy a pair of gloves in two hours , much less a baby . "
38248	38271	38120	38120	She	102	" Three hours , then , or four ; or make him learn English ways . At Florence we get a nurse - "
38272	38277	38279	38280	Miss Abbott	107	" But , Harriet , "
38282	38292	38279	38280	Miss Abbott	107	" what if at first he was to refuse ? "
38293	38304	38306	38306	Harriet	102	" I do n't know the meaning of the word , "
38309	38333	38306	38306	Harriet	102	" I 've told the landlady that Philip and I only want our rooms one night , and we shall keep to it . "
38334	38366	38120	38120	She	102	" I dare say it will be all right . But , as I told you , I thought the man I met on the Rocca a strange , difficult man . "
38367	38494	38306	38306	Harriet	102	" He 's insolent to ladies , we know . But my brother can be trusted to bring him to his senses . That woman , Philip , whom you saw will carry the baby to the hotel . Of course you must tip her for it . And try , if you can , to get poor Lilia 's silver bangles . They were nice quiet things , and will do for Irma . And there is an inlaid box I lent her - lent , not gave - to keep her handkerchiefs in . It 's of no real value ; but this is our only chance . Do n't ask for it ; but if you see it lying about , just say - "
38495	38557	38120	38120	She	102	" No , Harriet ; I 'll try for the baby , but for nothing else . I promise to do that tomorrow , and to do it in the way you wish . But tonight , as we 're all tired , we want a change of topic . We want relaxation . We want to go to the theatre . "
38558	38568	38306	38306	Harriet	102	" Theatres here ? And at such a moment ? "
38569	38582	38584	38585	Miss Abbott	107	" We should hardly enjoy it , with the great interview impending , "
38603	38621	38594	38594	He	172	" Do n't you think it 's better than sitting in all the evening and getting nervous ? "
38628	38667	38625	38625	her	304	" Mother would n't like it . It would be most unsuitable - almost irreverent . Besides all that , foreign theatres are notorious . Do n't you remember those letters in the ' Church Family Newspaper ' ? "
38668	38690	38691	38691	Harriet	102	" But this is an opera - ' Lucia di Lammermoor ' - Sir Walter Scott - classical , you know . "
38697	38741	38691	38691	Harriet	102	" Certainly one has so few opportunities of hearing music . It is sure to be very bad . But it might be better than sitting idle all the evening . We have no book , and I lost my crochet at Florence . "
38742	38753	38691	38691	Harriet	102	" Good . Miss Abbott , you are coming too ? "
38754	38791	38691	38691	Harriet	102	" It is very kind of you , Mr. Herriton . In some ways I should enjoy it ; but - excuse the suggestion - I do n't think we ought to go to cheap seats . "
38792	38797	38799	38799	Harriet	102	" Good gracious me ! "
38801	38838	38799	38799	Harriet	102	" I should never have thought of that . As likely as not , we should have tried to save money and sat among the most awful people . One keeps on forgetting this is Italy . "
38839	38852	38691	38691	Harriet	102	" Unfortunately I have no evening dress ; and if the seats - "
38853	38862	38864	38864	Philip	172	" Oh , that 'll be all right , "
38876	38897	38864	38864	Philip	172	" We 'll go as we are , and buy the best we can get . Monteriano is not formal . "
39049	39055	39032	39032	He	172	" La Zia di Carlo . "
39342	39348	39350	39350	Philip	172	" We do all right , "
39358	39385	39350	39350	Philip	172	" Yes , I know ; but pretty things pack as easily as ugly ones . We had no need to come to Italy like guys . "
39393	39403	39388	39388	he	172	" But we 're here to rescue a baby . "
39506	39515	39516	39516	he	172	" Do n't you like it at all ? "
39520	39524	39530	39530	they	1213	" Most awfully . "
39611	39614	39607	39607	She	102	" Shish ! "
39615	39619	39621	39622	her brother	1014	" Shut it , "
39624	39638	39607	39607	She	102	" We must make a stand from the beginning . They 're talking . "
39639	39644	39646	39647	Miss Abbott	107	" It is tiresome , "
39649	39660	39646	39647	Miss Abbott	107	" but perhaps it is n't for us to interfere . "
39818	39823	39805	39805	Lucia	189	" Welcome to Monteriano ! "
39824	39828	39830	39830	Harriet	102	" Ridiculous babies ! "
39838	39851	39853	39853	Philip	172	" Why , it is the famous hot lady of the Apennines , "
39855	39865	39853	39853	Philip	172	" the one who had never , never before - "
39866	39898	39899	39899	Lucia	189	" Ugh ! Do n't . She will be very vulgar . And I 'm sure it 's even worse here than in the tunnel . I wish we 'd never - "
40314	40318	40320	40321	the singer	1248	" Che carino ! "
40339	40344	40346	40348	many old gentlemen	1250	" Silence ! silence ! "
40351	40358	40346	40348	many old gentlemen	1250	" Let the divine creature continue ! "
40451	40456	40457	40457	she	102	" Call this classical ! "
40465	40480	40457	40457	she	102	" It 's not even respectable ! Philip ! take me out at once . "
40481	40486	40488	40489	her brother	1014	" Whose is it ? "
40507	40512	40488	40489	her brother	1014	" Whose is it ? "
40557	40562	40551	40551	Philip	172	" Whose is it ? "
40589	40594	40595	40596	the people	1735	" To the left ! "
40599	40607	40595	40596	the people	1735	" The innamorato is to the left . "
40653	40660	40662	40664	the young man	1260	" Why have you not written ? "
40666	40675	40662	40664	the young man	1260	" Why do you take me by surprise ? "
40676	40683	40685	40685	Philip	172	" Oh , I 've written , "
40688	40696	40685	40685	Philip	172	" I left a note this afternoon . "
40697	40702	40704	40712	the audience , who were beginning to have enough	1261	" Silence ! silence ! "
40714	40721	40704	40712	the audience , who were beginning to have enough	1261	" Let the divine creature continue . "
40729	40734	40736	40738	the young man	1260	" No ! no ! "
40740	40748	40736	40738	the young man	1260	" You do n't escape me now . "
40773	40780	40818	40819	The audience	2328	" Gino 's friends are ours - "
40781	40784	40786	40786	Gino	144	" Friends ? "
40788	40810	40786	40786	Gino	144	" A relative ! A brother ! Fra Filippo , who has come all the way from England and never written . "
40811	40817	40818	40819	The audience	2328	" I left a message . "
40824	40830	40818	40819	The audience	2328	" Come in to us . "
40831	40842	40846	40846	he	172	" Thank you - ladies - there is not time - "
41093	41100	41101	41101	he	172	" At ten o'clock , then , "
41106	41118	41101	41101	he	172	" I want to speak to you alone . At ten . "
41119	41122	41124	41125	the other	470	" Certainly ! "
41150	41159	41160	41160	she	102	" That was he , was n't it ? "
41163	41168	41101	41101	he	172	" Yes , rather . "
41169	41178	41101	41101	he	172	" I suppose you did n't settle anything ? "
41179	41384	41101	41101	he	172	" Why , no ; how could I ? The fact is - well , I got taken by surprise , but after all , what does it matter ? There 's no earthly reason why we should n't do the business pleasantly . He 's a perfectly charming person , and so are his friends . I 'm his friend now - his long - lost brother . What 's the harm ? I tell you , Miss Abbott , it 's one thing for England and another for Italy . There we plan and get on high moral horses . Here we find what asses we are , for things go off quite easily , all by themselves . My hat , what a night ! Did you ever see a really purple sky and really silver stars before ? Well , as I was saying , it 's absurd to worry ; he 's not a porky father . He wants that baby as little as I do . He 's been ragging my dear mother - just as he ragged me eighteen months ago , and I 've forgiven him . Oh , but he has a sense of humour ! "
41505	41516	41497	41497	She	107	" This time - the same place - the same thing "
41587	41591	41592	41592	she	107	" Help me ! "
41727	41731	41732	41732	she	150	" Scusi tanto ! "
41755	41761	41762	41764	the young lady	1289	" Is Signor Carella in ? "
41941	41945	41948	41948	Harriet	102	" Central Italy , "
42114	42120	42121	42121	she	150	" Harriet and her brother , "
42124	42259	42121	42121	she	150	" do n't realize what is before them . She would bluster and be rude ; he would be pleasant and take it as a joke . Both of them - even if they offered money - would fail . But I begin to understand the man 's nature ; he does not love the child , but he will be touchy about it - and that is quite as bad for us . He 's charming , but he 's no fool ; he conquered me last year ; he conquered Mr. Herriton yesterday , and if I am not careful he will conquer us all today , and the baby will grow up in Monteriano . He is terribly strong ; Lilia found that out , but only I remember it now . "
42369	42372	42402	42402	he	172	" unconventionality , "
42655	42660	42649	42649	He	172	" Where is Perfetta ? "
42735	42739	42740	42740	he	172	" You know ! "
42743	42755	42756	42756	He	172	" but you will not tell me . Exactly like you . "
42769	42821	42756	42756	He	172	" And why wo n't you tell me the numbers ? I have dreamt of a red hen - that is two hundred and five , and a friend unexpected - he means eighty - two . But I try for the Terno this week . So tell me another number . "
42902	42942	42944	42944	she	107	" Two hundred and five - eighty - two . In any case I shall put them on Bari , not on Florence . I can not tell you why ; I have a feeling this week for Bari . "
42972	43020	43056	43056	he	1322	" Ah ! you do n't care if you get the profits . You wo n't even say ' Thank you , Gino . ' Say it , or I 'll drop hot , red - hot ashes on you . ' Thank you , Gino - ' "
43104	43109	43110	43110	he	1322	" What is it ? "
43113	43119	43110	43110	he	1322	" What has frightened you ? "
43160	43163	43164	43164	she	107	" Business - "
43169	43174	43120	43120	He	1322	" Business with me ? "
43175	43180	43181	43181	She	107	" Most important business . "
43194	43208	43120	43120	He	1322	" Before business you must get well ; this is the best wine . "
43257	43263	43264	43264	she	107	" Perhaps you are engaged , "
43267	43276	43264	43264	she	107	" And as I am not very well - "
43277	43293	43294	43294	She	107	" You are not well enough to go back . And I am not engaged . "
43302	43309	43310	43310	he	1322	" Ah , now I understand , "
43313	43328	43310	43310	he	1322	" Now I see what frightened you . But why did you never speak ? "
43670	43723	43654	43654	she	107	" What a fine child , Signor Carella . And how nice of you to talk to it . Though I see that the ungrateful little fellow is asleep ! Seven months ? No , eight ; of course eight . Still , he is a remarkably fine child for his age . "
43747	43774	43775	43775	he	1339	" You must not stand . Let us sit on the loggia , where it is cool . I am afraid the room is very untidy , "
43850	43853	43855	43856	Miss Abbott	107	" Posing ! "
43860	43867	43855	43856	Miss Abbott	107	" A born artist 's model . "
43868	43874	43875	43875	she	107	" Mr. Herriton called yesterday , "
43878	43884	43875	43875	she	107	" but you were out . "
43982	43986	43987	43987	he	1339	" But guess ! "
44038	44043	44044	44044	He	1339	" E manca questo ! "
44079	44083	44084	44084	she	107	" This house , "
44087	44093	44084	44084	she	107	" is a large house . "
44094	44097	44099	44099	his	1339	" Exactly , "
44103	44111	44112	44112	He	1339	" And when my poor wife died - "
44161	44240	44137	44137	he	1339	" When my poor wife died I thought of having my relatives to live here . My father wished to give up his practice at Empoli ; my mother and sisters and two aunts were also willing . But it was impossible . They have their ways of doing things , and when I was younger I was content with them . But now I am a man . I have my own ways . Do you understand ? "
44241	44247	44249	44250	Miss Abbott	107	" Yes , I do , "
44320	44327	44328	44328	she	107	" It is a large house , "
44331	44369	44328	44328	she	107	" Immense ; and the taxes ! But it will be better when - Ah ! but you have never guessed why I went to Poggibonsi - why it was that I was out when he called . "
44370	44385	44295	44295	Gino	144	" I can not guess , Signor Carella . I am here on business . "
44386	44390	44328	44328	she	107	" But try . "
44391	44401	44295	44295	Gino	144	" I can not ; I hardly know you . "
44402	44409	44410	44410	he	144	" But we are old friends , "
44413	44436	44410	44410	he	144	" and your approval will be grateful to me . You gave it me once before . Will you give it now ? "
44437	44448	44449	44449	she	1348	" I have not come as a friend this time , "
44453	44469	44449	44449	she	1348	" I am not likely , Signor Carella , to approve of anything you do . "
44470	44475	44476	44476	He	144	" Oh , Signorina ! "
44488	44495	44476	44476	He	144	" Surely you approve of marriage ? "
44496	44502	44504	44505	Miss Abbott	107	" Where there is love , "
44531	44537	44539	44539	he	144	" Where there is love , "
44556	44568	44548	44548	he	144	" Do I understand that you are proposing to marry again ? "
44572	44579	44548	44548	he	144	" I forbid you , then ! "
44595	44600	44602	44603	Miss Abbott	107	" I forbid you ! "
44621	44625	44626	44626	He	144	" But why ? "
44651	44702	44632	44632	His	144	" You have ruined one woman ; I forbid you to ruin another . It is not a year since Lilia died . You pretended to me the other day that you loved her . It is a lie . You wanted her money . Has this woman money too ? "
44703	44708	44709	44709	he	144	" Why , yes ! "
44713	44717	44709	44709	he	144	" A little . "
44718	44730	44632	44632	His	144	" And I suppose you will say that you love her . "
44731	44748	44749	44749	He	144	" I shall not say it . It will be untrue . Now my poor wife - "
44873	44881	44882	44882	he	144	" So you do not advise me ? "
44886	44895	44882	44882	he	144	" But why should it be a failure ? "
44922	44928	44929	44929	she	107	" How can it succeed , "
44933	44940	44929	44929	she	107	" where there is no love ? "
44941	44955	44980	44980	He	144	" But she does love me ! I forgot to tell you that . "
44956	44959	44929	44929	she	107	" Indeed . "
44960	44963	44964	44964	He	144	" Passionately . "
44973	44979	44929	44929	she	107	" Then God help her ! "
44984	45082	44980	44980	He	144	" Whatever I say displeases you , Signorina . God help you , for you are most unfair . You say that I ill - treated my dear wife . It is not so . I have never ill - treated any one . You complain that there is no love in this marriage . I prove that there is , and you become still more angry . What do you want ? Do you suppose she will not be contented ? Glad enough she is to get me , and she will do her duty well . "
45083	45087	45089	45090	Miss Abbott	107	" Her duty ! "
45102	45116	44980	44980	He	144	" Why , of course . She knows why I am marrying her . "
45117	45134	45137	45137	she	107	" To succeed where Lilia failed ! To be your housekeeper , your slave , you - "
45149	45158	45160	45160	he	1358	" To look after the baby , certainly , "
45162	45167	45168	45168	She	107	" The baby - ? "
45173	45180	45181	45181	he	1358	" It is an English marriage , "
45185	45208	45181	45181	he	1358	" I do not care about the money . I am having her for my son . Did you not understand that ? "
45209	45212	45214	45215	Miss Abbott	107	" No , "
45230	45247	45181	45181	he	1358	" It is not necessary , Signor Carella . Since you are tired of the baby - "
45264	45271	45272	45272	she	107	" I do n't mean that , "
45276	45280	45282	45282	his	1358	" I know , "
45286	45306	45282	45282	his	1358	" Ah , in a foreign language and how perfectly you speak Italian one is certain to make slips . "
45320	45465	45307	45307	She	107	" You meant that we could not always be together yet , he and I. You are right . What is to be done ? I can not afford a nurse , and Perfetta is too rough . When he was ill I dare not let her touch him . When he has to be washed , which happens now and then , who does it ? I. I feed him , or settle what he shall have . I sleep with him and comfort him when he is unhappy in the night . No one talks , no one may sing to him but I. Do not be unfair this time ; I like to do these things . But nevertheless his voice became pathetic they take up a great deal of time , and are not all suitable for a young man . "
45466	45472	45474	45475	Miss Abbott	107	" Not at all suitable , "
45521	45527	45529	45529	Gino	144	" A little more wine ? "
45532	45565	45585	45585	He	144	" Oh , no , thank you ! But marriage , Signor Carella , is a very serious step . Could you not manage more simply ? Your relative , for example - "
45566	45578	45585	45585	He	144	" Empoli ! I would as soon have him in England ! "
45579	45584	45585	45585	He	144	" England , then - "
45588	45601	45585	45585	He	144	" He has a grandmother there , you know - Mrs. Theobald . "
45602	45640	45641	45641	he	144	" He has a grandmother here . No , he is troublesome , but I must have him with me . I will not even have my father and mother too . For they would separate us , "
45644	45647	45585	45585	He	144	" How ? "
45648	45655	45656	45656	She	1360	" They would separate our thoughts . "
45765	45769	45770	45770	he	144	" Wake up ! "
45802	45808	45809	45809	She	107	" Oh , take care ! "
45820	45852	45809	45809	She	107	" He is not much longer than my boot , is he ? Can you believe that in time his own boots will be as large ? And that he also - "
45853	45863	45809	45809	She	107	" But ought you to treat him like that ? "
46012	46017	46000	46000	Gino	144	" father - son , "
46061	46111	46058	46058	his	144	" This woman will do exactly what I tell her . She is fond of children . She is clean ; she has a pleasant voice . She is not beautiful ; I can not pretend that to you for a moment . But she is what I require . "
46119	46126	46128	46129	Miss Abbott	107	" Oh , do take care ! "
46131	46137	46128	46129	Miss Abbott	107	" You are squeezing it . "
46138	46168	46058	46058	his	144	" It is nothing . If he cries silently then you may be frightened . He thinks I am going to wash him , and he is quite right . "
46169	46173	46174	46174	she	107	" Wash him ! "
46177	46182	46174	46174	she	107	" You ? Here ? "
46234	46242	46243	46243	he	1380	" I had gone to the Farmacia , "
46246	46302	46243	46243	he	1380	" and was sitting there comfortably , when suddenly I remembered that Perfetta had heated water an hour ago - over there , look , covered with a cushion . I came away at once , for really he must be washed . You must excuse me . I can put it off no longer . "
46303	46310	46311	46311	she	107	" I have wasted your time , "
46405	46422	46399	46400	Miss Abbott	107	" But why are you going ? Excuse me if I wash him while we talk . "
46423	46431	46433	46434	Miss Abbott	107	" I have nothing more to say , "
46478	46486	46487	46487	he	1380	" Oh , but stop a moment ! "
46490	46498	46487	46487	he	1380	" You have not seen him yet . "
46499	46512	46519	46519	He	1380	" I have seen as much as I want , thank you . "
46535	46539	46519	46519	He	1380	" Take him ! "
46547	46554	46555	46555	she	107	" I must go at once , "
46572	46640	46666	46666	Gino	144	" Who would have believed his mother was blonde ? For he is brown all over - brown every inch of him . Ah , but how beautiful he is ! And he is mine ; mine for ever . Even if he hates me he will be mine . He can not help it ; he is made out of me ; I am his father . "
46805	46814	46815	46815	she	107	" May I help you to wash him ? "
46902	46910	46911	46911	he	144	" It is very kind of you , "
46914	46988	46911	46911	he	144	" especially in your beautiful dress . He is nearly clean already . Why , I take the whole morning ! There is so much more of a baby than one expects . And Perfetta washes him just as she washes clothes . Then he screams for hours . My wife is to have a light hand . Ah , how he kicks ! Has he splashed you ? I am very sorry . "
46989	46999	47001	47002	Miss Abbott	107	" I am ready for a soft towel now , "
47012	47017	47018	47018	He	144	" Certainly ! certainly ! "
47052	47060	47040	47040	he	144	" And if you had any powder . "
47249	47252	47253	47253	he	144	" Hullo ! "
47286	47292	47294	47294	Philip	172	" No , do stop ! "
47296	47325	47294	47294	Philip	172	" I got your note . I 'm not offended ; you 're quite right . I really want you ; I could never have done it alone . "
47349	47362	47333	47333	she	1408	" Signorina , do stop a little - after all your kindness . "
47368	47373	47375	47375	Philip	172	" What is it ? "
47423	47428	47430	47430	Philip	172	" What is it ? "
47476	47482	47484	47484	Gino	144	" Well , your business , "
47491	47503	47484	47484	Gino	144	" Our business - Miss Abbott has told you of that . "
47504	47507	47556	47556	Gino	144	" No . "
47508	47512	47484	47484	Gino	144	" But surely - "
47513	47528	47556	47556	Gino	144	" She came for business . But she forgot about it ; so did I. "
47580	47583	47585	47585	Harriet	102	" Mad ! "
47588	47597	47585	47585	Harriet	102	" absolutely stark , staring , raving mad ! "
47607	47670	47565	47565	he	144	" What 's she here for ? Answer me that . What 's she doing in Monteriano in August ? Why is n't she in Normandy ? Answer that . She wo n't . I can : she 's come to thwart us ; she 's betrayed us - got hold of mother 's plans . Oh , goodness , my head ! "
47678	47701	47671	47671	He	172	" You must n't accuse her of that . Though she is exasperating , she has n't come here to betray us . "
47702	47714	47715	47715	He	172	" Then why has she come here ? Answer me that . "
47733	47882	47722	47723	his sister	304	" Bursting in on me - crying and looking a disgusting sight - and says she has been to see the Italian . Could n't even talk properly ; pretended she had changed her opinions . What are her opinions to us ? I was very calm . I said : ' Miss Abbott , I think there is a little misapprehension in this matter . My mother , Mrs. Herriton - ' Oh , goodness , my head ! Of course you 've failed - do n't trouble to answer - I know you 've failed . Where 's the baby , pray ? Of course you have n't got it . Dear sweet Caroline wo n't let you . Oh , yes , and we 're to go away at once and trouble the father no more . Those are her commands . Commands ! COMMANDS ! "
47919	48017	47916	47916	she	304	" I 've not got the baby , Harriet , but at the same time I have n't exactly failed . I and Signor Carella are to have another interview this afternoon , at the Caffe Garibaldi . He is perfectly reasonable and pleasant . Should you be disposed to come with me , you would find him quite willing to discuss things . He is desperately in want of money , and has no prospect of getting any . I discovered that . At the same time , he has a certain affection for the child . "
48166	48173	48174	48174	he	172	" Miss Abbott has behaved extraordinarily , "
48179	48186	48174	48174	he	172	" but at the same time - "
48211	48234	48194	48194	She	304	" Harriet , you must listen . My dear , you must stop crying . I have something quite important to say . "
48235	48242	48244	48244	she	304	" I shall not stop crying , "
48263	48296	48194	48194	She	304	" Remember that Miss Abbott has done us no harm . She said nothing to him about the matter . He assumes that she is working with us : I gathered that . "
48297	48304	48194	48194	She	304	" Well , she is n't . "
48305	48356	48194	48194	She	304	" Yes ; but if you 're careful she may be . I interpret her behaviour thus : She went to see him , honestly intending to get the child away . In the note she left me she says so , and I do n't believe she 'd lie . "
48357	48361	48194	48194	She	304	" I do . "
48362	48415	48194	48194	She	304	" When she got there , there was some pretty domestic scene between him and the baby , and she has got swept off in a gush of sentimentalism . Before very long , if I know anything about psychology , there will be a reaction . She 'll be swept back . "
48416	48428	48194	48194	She	304	" I do n't understand your long words . Say plainly - "
48429	48469	48194	48194	She	304	" When she 's swept back , she 'll be invaluable . For she has made quite an impression on him . He thinks her so nice with the baby . You know , she washed it for him . "
48470	48473	48194	48194	She	304	" Disgusting ! "
48526	48557	48632	48632	Philip	172	" If you want to carry off the baby , keep your peace with Miss Abbott . For if she chooses , she can help you better than I can . "
48558	48569	48571	48571	Harriet	102	" There can be no peace between me and her , "
48574	48578	48632	48632	Philip	172	" Did you - "
48579	48607	48632	48632	Philip	172	" Oh , not all I wanted . She went away before I had finished speaking - just like those cowardly people ! - into the church . "
48608	48614	48632	48632	Philip	172	" Into Santa Deodata 's ? "
48615	48629	48632	48632	Philip	172	" Yes ; I 'm sure she needs it . Anything more unchristian - "
49045	49048	49050	49050	Philip	172	" Please , "
49052	49060	49050	49050	Philip	172	" is there an English lady here ? "
49209	49218	49220	49220	she	1451	" I am sure that I need it , "
49243	49251	49252	49252	she	1451	" I 've nothing to tell you , "
49255	49296	49252	49252	she	1451	" I have simply changed straight round . If I had planned the whole thing out , I could not have treated you worse . I can talk it over now ; but please believe that I have been crying . "
49297	49310	49312	49312	Philip	172	" And please believe that I have not come to scold you , "
49314	49321	49312	49312	Philip	172	" I know what has happened . "
49322	49325	49327	49328	Miss Abbott	107	" What ? "
49384	49403	49348	49350	Giovanni da Empoli	201	" What might have happened to me - he had made you believe that he loved the child . "
49404	49419	49348	49350	Giovanni da Empoli	201	" Oh , yes ; he has . He will never give it up . "
49420	49428	49348	49350	Giovanni da Empoli	201	" At present it is still unsettled . "
49429	49436	49348	49350	Giovanni da Empoli	201	" It will never be settled . "
49437	49501	49348	49350	Giovanni da Empoli	201	" Perhaps not . Well , as I said , I know what has happened , and I am not here to scold you . But I must ask you to withdraw from the thing for the present . Harriet is furious . But she will calm down when she realizes that you have done us no harm , and will do none . "
49502	49509	49510	49510	she	1467	" I can do no more , "
49513	49524	49510	49510	she	1467	" But I tell you plainly I have changed sides . "
49525	49551	49348	49350	Giovanni da Empoli	201	" If you do no more , that is all we want . You promise not to prejudice our cause by speaking to Signor Carella ? "
49552	49575	49510	49510	she	1467	" Oh , certainly . I do n't want to speak to him again ; I sha n't ever see him again . "
49576	49584	49348	49350	Giovanni da Empoli	201	" Quite nice , was n't he ? "
49585	49588	49510	49510	she	1467	" Quite . "
49589	49618	49348	49350	Giovanni da Empoli	201	" Well , that 's all I wanted to know . I 'll go and tell Harriet of your promise , and I think things'll quiet down now . "
49693	49702	49703	49703	she	1468	" Why are n't you angry with me ? "
49710	49732	49703	49703	she	1468	" Because I understand you - all sides , I think , - Harriet , Signor Carella , even my mother . "
49733	49755	49756	49756	He	1467	" You do understand wonderfully . You are the only one of us who has a general view of the muddle . "
49907	49916	49918	49919	Miss Abbott	107	" So what are you going to do ? "
49939	49942	49943	49943	he	172	" Do ? "
49949	49957	49943	49943	he	172	" This afternoon I have another interview . "
49958	49967	49921	49921	Philip	172	" It will come to nothing . Well ? "
49968	49996	49943	49943	he	172	" Then another . If that fails I shall wire home for instructions . I dare say we may fail altogether , but we shall fail honourably . "
50037	50088	50034	50034	she	1468	" That 's not doing anything ! You would be doing something if you kidnapped the baby , or if you went straight away . But that ! To fail honourably ! To come out of the thing as well as you can ! Is that all you are after ? "
50089	50094	50095	50095	he	172	" Why , yes , "
50098	50169	50095	50095	he	172	" Since we talk openly , that is all I am after just now . What else is there ? If I can persuade Signor Carella to give in , so much the better . If he wo n't , I must report the failure to my mother and then go home . Why , Miss Abbott , you ca n't expect me to follow you through all these turns - "
50170	50281	50034	50034	she	1468	" I do n't ! But I do expect you to settle what is right and to follow that . Do you want the child to stop with his father , who loves him and will bring him up badly , or do you want him to come to Sawston , where no one loves him , but where he will be brought up well ? There is the question put dispassionately enough even for you . Settle it . Settle which side you 'll fight on . But do n't go talking about an ' honourable failure , ' which means simply not thinking and not acting at all . "
50282	50301	50095	50095	he	172	" Because I understand the position of Signor Carella and of you , it 's no reason that - "
50302	50463	50034	50034	she	1468	" None at all . Fight as if you think us wrong . Oh , what 's the use of your fair - mindedness if you never decide for yourself ? Any one gets hold of you and makes you do what they want . And you see through them and laugh at them - and do it . It 's not enough to see clearly ; I 'm muddle - headed and stupid , and not worth a quarter of you , but I have tried to do what seemed right at the time . And you - your brain and your insight are splendid . But when you see what 's right you 're too idle to do it . You told me once that we shall be judged by our intentions , not by our accomplishments . I thought it a grand remark . But we must intend to accomplish - not sit intending on a chair . "
50464	50469	50470	50470	he	1475	" You are wonderful ! "
50474	50481	50482	50482	she	1476	" Oh , you appreciate me ! "
50487	50526	50482	50482	she	1476	" I wish you did n't . You appreciate us all - see good in all of us . And all the time you are dead - dead - dead . Look , why are n't you angry ? "
50549	50584	50541	50541	she	1476	" You are so splendid , Mr. Herriton , that I ca n't bear to see you wasted . I ca n't bear - she has not been good to you - your mother . "
50585	50808	50859	50859	She	1477	" Miss Abbott , do n't worry over me . Some people are born not to do things . I 'm one of them ; I never did anything at school or at the Bar . I came out to stop Lilia 's marriage , and it was too late . I came out intending to get the baby , and I shall return an ' honourable failure . ' I never expect anything to happen now , and so I am never disappointed . You would be surprised to know what my great events are . Going to the theatre yesterday , talking to you now - I do n't suppose I shall ever meet anything greater . I seem fated to pass through the world without colliding with it or moving it - and I 'm sure I ca n't tell you whether the fate 's good or evil . I do n't die - I do n't fall in love . And if other people die or fall in love they always do it when I 'm just not there . You are quite right ; life to me is just a spectacle , which - thank God , and thank Italy , and thank you - is now more beautiful and heartening than it has ever been before . "
50813	50834	50809	50809	She	1477	" I wish something would happen to you , my dear friend ; I wish something would happen to you . "
50835	50839	50840	50840	he	1478	" But why ? "
50845	50858	50840	50840	he	1478	" Prove to me why I do n't do as I am . "
50994	50998	50999	50999	he	172	" Look here ! "
51009	51054	50999	50999	he	172	" it 's too hot for this . We 've been talking and interviewing each other all the morning , and I have another interview this afternoon . I do stipulate for silence . Let each lady retire to her bedroom with a book . "
51055	51061	51063	51063	Harriet	102	" I retire to pack , "
51065	51088	51063	51063	Harriet	102	" Please remind Signor Carella , Philip , that the baby is to be here by half - past eight this evening . "
51089	51105	50999	50999	he	172	" Oh , certainly , Harriet . I shall make a point of reminding him . "
51106	51119	51063	51063	Harriet	102	" And order a carriage to take us to the evening train . "
51120	51124	51126	51127	Miss Abbott	107	" And please , "
51129	51139	51126	51127	Miss Abbott	107	" would you order a carriage for me too ? "
51140	51144	51145	51145	he	1481	" You going ? "
51148	51152	51153	51153	she	102	" Of course , "
51159	51163	51153	51153	she	102	" Why not ? "
51164	51186	51187	51187	He	1481	" Why , of course you would be going . Two carriages , then . Two carriages for the evening train . "
51194	51209	51187	51187	He	1481	" Harriet , whatever are you up to ? We shall never be ready . "
51210	51219	51221	51221	Harriet	102	" Order my carriage for the evening train , "
51226	51245	51187	51187	He	1481	" Well , I suppose I shall . And I shall also have my interview with Signor Carella . "
51253	51273	51246	51247	Miss Abbott	107	" But why should you mind ? Do you suppose that I shall have the slightest influence over him ? "
51274	51321	51187	51187	He	1481	" No . But - I ca n't repeat all that I said in the church . You ought never to see him again . You ought to bundle Harriet into a carriage , not this evening , but now , and drive her straight away . "
51322	51455	51246	51247	Miss Abbott	107	" Perhaps I ought . But it is n't a very big ' ought . ' Whatever Harriet and I do the issue is the same . Why , I can see the splendour of it - even the humour . Gino sitting up here on the mountain - top with his cub . We come and ask for it . He welcomes us . We ask for it again . He is equally pleasant . I 'm agreeable to spend the whole week bargaining with him . But I know that at the end of it I shall descend empty - handed to the plains . It might be finer of me to make up my mind . But I 'm not a fine character . And nothing hangs on it . "
51456	51462	51463	51463	she	1483	" Perhaps I am extreme , "
51467	51559	51463	51463	she	1483	" I 've been trying to run you , just like your mother . I feel you ought to fight it out with Harriet . Every little trifle , for some reason , does seem incalculably important today , and when you say of a thing that ' nothing hangs on it , ' it sounds like blasphemy . There 's never any knowing - how am I to put it ? - which of our actions , which of our idlenesses wo n't have things hanging on it for ever . "
51707	51714	51715	51715	he	172	" Well , you are right , "
51718	51728	51715	51715	he	172	" This affair is being managed by the ladies . "
51729	51738	51745	51745	he	470	" Ah , the ladies - the ladies ! "
51773	51782	51784	51784	Philip	172	" Well , I have done my best , "
51805	51828	51784	51784	Philip	172	" I shall face my mother with a good conscience . Will you bear me witness that I 've done my best ? "
51829	51837	51838	51838	He	172	" My poor fellow , I will ! "
51848	51854	51838	51838	He	172	" And that I have - "
51894	51898	51899	51899	he	172	" Mia sorella ! "
51936	51940	51942	51942	Philip	172	" Poor Harriet ! "
51948	51967	51942	51942	Philip	172	" One more wrench and it will all be over for her ; we are leaving this evening . "
51974	51992	51968	51968	Gino	144	" Then you will not be here this evening as you promised us . All three leaving ? "
51993	51997	51999	51999	Philip	172	" All three , "
52011	52037	51999	51999	Philip	172	" by the night train ; at least , that is my sister 's plan . So I 'm afraid I sha n't be here . "
52472	52477	52479	52479	Philip	172	" Yes , do , "
52488	52529	52479	52479	Philip	172	" Now that we have quarrelled we scarcely want to travel in procession all the way down the hill . Well , good - bye ; it 's all over at last ; another scene in my pageant has shifted . "
52530	52556	52557	52557	She	102	" Good - bye ; it 's been a great pleasure to see you . I hope that wo n't shift , at all events . "
52562	52567	52568	52568	he	172	" You sound despondent , "
52573	52582	52568	52568	he	172	" Do n't forget that you return victorious . "
52583	52589	52590	52590	she	102	" I suppose I do , "
52696	52704	52705	52705	he	172	" It 's hard luck on her , "
52708	52724	52705	52705	he	172	" She is a good person . I must do for her anything I can . "
52841	52860	52832	52832	Philip	172	" Blessed be the Lord my God who teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight . "
52899	52904	52906	52907	the landlady	476	" Depend upon it , "
52927	53019	52910	52910	she	476	" Philip did not think it likely . They shouted all over the house and still there was no Harriet . He began to be uneasy . He was helpless without Miss Abbott ; her grave , kind face had cheered him wonderfully , even when it looked displeased . Monteriano was sad without her ; the rain was thickening ; the scraps of Donizetti floated tunelessly out of the wineshops , and of the great tower opposite he could only see the base , fresh papered with the advertisements of quacks .
53033	53051	53020	53021	A man	1757	" Start at once . Pick me up outside the gate . Pay the bearer . H. H. "
53052	53061	53062	53062	he	172	" Did the lady give you this note ? "
53070	53074	53076	53076	Philip	172	" Speak up ! "
53078	53087	53076	53076	Philip	172	" Who gave it you - and where ? "
53100	53106	53108	53109	the driver	426	" Be patient with him , "
53117	53124	53108	53109	the driver	426	" It is the poor idiot . "
53135	53152	53126	53127	the landlady	476	" The poor idiot . He can not speak . He takes messages for us all . "
53201	53204	53206	53207	the Englishman	774	" Ugh ! "
53209	53236	53206	53207	the Englishman	774	" Signora padrona , find out from him ; this note is from my sister . What does it mean ? Where did he see her ? "
53237	53243	53245	53246	the landlady	476	" It is no good , "
53248	53258	53245	53246	the landlady	476	" He understands everything but he can explain nothing . "
53259	53267	53269	53274	the man who drove the cab	1534	" He has visions of the saints , "
53276	53292	53245	53246	the landlady	476	" But my sister - where has she gone ? How has she met him ? "
53293	53301	53303	53304	the landlady	476	" She has gone for a walk , "
53321	53374	53313	53313	she	476	" She has gone for a walk - perhaps to wish good - bye to her little nephew . Preferring to come back another way , she has sent you this note by the poor idiot and is waiting for you outside the Siena gate . Many of my guests do this . "
53421	53425	53427	53427	Philip	172	" Go on , "
53429	53436	53427	53427	Philip	172	" I have paid him plenty . "
53475	53479	53481	53481	Philip	172	" Go on ! "
53553	53560	53561	53561	he	426	" What am I to do ? "
53564	53581	53561	53561	he	426	" it is not like the lady to be late . We shall miss the train . "
53582	53588	53590	53591	the driver	426	" Let us drive slowly , "
53593	53605	53590	53591	the driver	426	" and you shall call her by name as we go . "
53616	53623	53614	53614	Philip	172	" Harriet ! Harriet ! Harriet ! "
53644	53653	53626	53626	she	102	" Harriet , why do n't you answer ? "
53654	53660	53662	53662	she	102	" I heard you coming , "
53681	53686	53626	53626	she	102	" What 's that ? "
53687	53690	53673	53673	he	172	" Hush - "
53691	53696	53626	53626	she	102	" Whatever is that ? "
53697	53702	53673	53673	he	172	" Hush - sleeping . "
53822	53826	53827	53827	he	172	" Poor Gino , "
53830	53842	53827	53827	he	172	" He 's no greater than I am , after all . "
53901	53908	53909	53909	he	172	" You have been pretty secret , "
53912	53933	53909	53909	he	172	" you might tell me a little now . What do we pay for him ? All we 've got ? "
53934	53937	53939	53939	Harriet	102	" Hush ! "
54088	54094	54095	54095	he	172	" Look here , Harriet , "
54100	54112	54095	54095	he	172	" I feel bad ; I want to see the baby . "
54113	54116	54146	54146	Harriet	102	" Hush ! "
54117	54145	54095	54095	he	172	" I do n't mind if I do wake him up . I want to see him . I 've as much right in him as you . "
54164	54169	54170	54170	he	172	" Wait a minute , "
54191	54197	54198	54198	he	172	" But he 's awake ! "
54206	54214	54215	54215	Philip	172	" Good ickle quiet boysey , then . "
54218	54232	54215	54215	Philip	172	" His face , do you know , struck me as all wrong . "
54233	54237	54272	54272	He	172	" All wrong ? "
54238	54243	54215	54215	Philip	172	" All puckered queerly . "
54244	54258	54272	54272	He	172	" Of course - with the shadows - you could n't see him . "
54259	54267	54268	54268	She	102	" Well , hold him up again . "
54294	54297	54299	54299	Harriet	102	" Nonsense , "
54302	54311	54299	54299	Harriet	102	" We should hear him if he cried . "
54312	54331	54272	54272	He	172	" No , he 's crying hard ; I thought so before , and I 'm certain now . "
54345	54355	54356	54356	she	102	" Oh , the night air , I suppose , "
54359	54368	54356	54356	she	102	" or perhaps the wet of the rain . "
54369	54428	54299	54299	Harriet	102	" I say , you have n't hurt it , or held it the wrong way , or anything ; it is too uncanny - crying and no noise . Why did n't you get Perfetta to carry it to the hotel instead of muddling with the messenger ? It 's a marvel he understood about the note . "
54429	54435	54440	54440	her	102	" Oh , he understands . "
54443	54451	54440	54440	her	102	" He tried to carry the baby - "
54452	54460	54496	54496	she	102	" But why not Gino or Perfetta ? "
54461	54484	54485	54485	She	102	" Philip , do n't talk . Must I say it again ? Do n't talk . The baby wants to sleep . "
54654	54667	54668	54668	he	172	" I suppose he breathes , and all that sort of thing ? "
54671	54675	54677	54677	Harriet	102	" Of course , "
54684	54712	54677	54677	Harriet	102	" You 've started him again . I 'm certain he was asleep . I do wish you would n't talk ; it makes me so nervous . "
54713	54740	54789	54789	she	1576	" I 'm nervous too . I wish he 'd scream . It 's too uncanny . Poor Gino ! I 'm terribly sorry for Gino . "
54741	54745	54677	54677	Harriet	102	" Are you ? "
54746	54786	54789	54789	she	1576	" Because he 's weak - like most of us . He does n't know what he wants . He does n't grip on to life . But I like that man , and I 'm sorry for him . "
54794	54854	54789	54789	she	1576	" You despise him , Harriet , and you despise me . But you do us no good by it . We fools want some one to set us on our feet . Suppose a really decent woman had set up Gino - I believe Caroline Abbott might have done it - might n't he have been another man ? "
54855	54858	54859	54859	she	1576	" Philip , "
54868	54891	54859	54859	she	1576	" do you happen to have those matches handy ? We might as well look at the baby again if you have . "
54920	54934	54904	54904	He	1576	" Oh , I do n't want all that bother . Try again . "
55072	55078	55079	55079	he	172	" Are you all right ? "
55107	55128	55101	55101	Harriet	102	" The baby - the baby - it slipped - it 's gone from my arms - I stole it ! "
55129	55134	55136	55136	Philip	172	" God help me ! "
55181	55201	55174	55174	Harriet	102	" I stole it ! I stole it ! I stole it ! It slipped out of my arms ! "
55202	55206	55207	55207	he	172	" Keep still ! "
55212	55227	55207	55207	he	172	" Let no one move . We may tread on it . Keep still . "
55349	55364	55365	55365	She	1594	" I stole it ! I and the idiot - no one was there . "
55447	55452	55480	55480	her	107	" Where are you ? "
55485	55488	55489	55489	he	172	" Silence ! "
56143	56153	56154	56154	she	1620	" I will be as quick as I can , "
56158	56182	56154	56154	she	1620	" But there are many streets in Monteriano ; he is sometimes difficult to find . I could not find him this morning . "
56183	56191	56193	56193	Philip	172	" Go first to the Caffe Garibaldi , "
56299	56315	56291	56291	Gino	144	" So you are back ! How glad I am ! We are all waiting - "
56392	56398	56400	56400	Philip	172	" My sister is ill , "
56402	56422	56400	56400	Philip	172	" and Miss Abbott is guiltless . I should be glad if you did not have to trouble them . "
56454	56460	56461	56461	he	144	" It is through me , "
56464	56484	56461	56461	he	144	" It happened because I was cowardly and idle . I have come to know what you will do . "
56519	56531	56513	56513	Philip	172	" Gently , man , gently ; he is not here . "
56597	56623	56594	56594	he	172	" Break down , Gino ; you must break down . Scream and curse and give in for a little ; you must break down . "
56637	56660	56679	56679	he	172	" It is time to be unhappy . Break down or you will be ill like my sister . You will go - "
56704	56707	56715	56715	he	172	" Gino ! "
56724	56766	56715	56715	he	172	" You are to do what you like with me , Gino . Your son is dead , Gino . He died in my arms , remember . It does not excuse me ; but he did die in my arms . "
56820	56824	56826	56827	the Englishman	774	" You brute ! "
56829	56845	56826	56827	the Englishman	774	" Kill me if you like ! But just you leave my broken arm alone . "
56955	56965	56944	56944	he	144	" Do what you like ; but think first - "
57610	57632	57594	57594	his	144	" But your son is dead , Gino . Your son is dead , dear Gino . Your son is dead . "
57669	57686	57641	57642	Miss Abbott	107	" What is the good of another death ? What is the good of more pain ? "
57763	57768	57770	57771	Miss Abbott	107	" Go to him , "
57776	57785	57770	57771	Miss Abbott	107	" Pick him up . Treat him kindly . "
57816	57821	57823	57823	Philip	172	" Help ! help ! "
57869	57876	57877	57877	he	172	" Oh , the foul devil ! "
57880	57889	57877	57877	he	172	" Kill him ! Kill him for me . "
57911	57917	57904	57904	she	107	" This thing stops here . "
57918	57923	57925	57925	Perfetta	150	" Latte ! latte ! "
57932	57935	57936	57936	she	107	" Remember , "
57939	57966	57936	57936	she	107	" there is to be no revenge . I will have no more intentional evil . We are not to fight with each other any more . "
57967	57974	57976	57976	Philip	172	" I shall never forgive him , "
57978	57988	57989	57989	Perfetta	150	" Latte ! latte freschissima ! bianca come neve ! "
58007	58015	58016	58016	he	144	" Put the milk on the table , "
58019	58030	58016	58016	he	144	" It will not be wanted in the other room . "
58329	58333	58335	58335	she	107	" That milk , "
58337	58356	58335	58335	she	107	" need not be wasted . Take it , Signor Carella , and persuade Mr. Herriton to drink . "
58377	58383	58399	58399	she	107	" Is there any left ? "
58384	58388	58390	58390	Gino	144	" A little , "
58392	58397	58399	58399	she	107	" Then finish it . "
58412	58419	58399	58399	she	107	" Will you not have some ? "
58420	58432	58399	58399	she	107	" I do not care for milk ; finish it all . "
58433	58442	58399	58399	she	107	" Philip , have you had enough milk ? "
58443	58455	58399	58399	she	107	" Yes , thank you , Gino ; finish it all . "
58485	58491	58492	58492	he	172	" It does not matter , "
58496	58510	58492	58492	he	172	" It does not matter . It will never be wanted any more . "
58513	58521	58523	58523	Philip	172	" He will have to marry her , "
58525	58696	58523	58523	Philip	172	" I heard from him this morning , just as we left Milan . He finds he has gone too far to back out . It would be expensive . I do n't know how much he minds - not as much as we suppose , I think . At all events there 's not a word of blame in the letter . I do n't believe he even feels angry . I never was so completely forgiven . Ever since you stopped him killing me , it has been a vision of perfect friendship . He nursed me , he lied for me at the inquest , and at the funeral , though he was crying , you would have thought it was my son who had died . Certainly I was the only person he had to be kind to ; he was so distressed not to make Harriet 's acquaintance , and that he scarcely saw anything of you . In his letter he says so again . "
58697	58707	58709	58710	Miss Abbott	107	" Thank him , please , when you write , "
58712	58720	58709	58710	Miss Abbott	107	" and give him my kindest regards . "
58721	58726	58727	58727	He	1677	" Indeed I will . "
58844	58857	58831	58831	Gino	144	" to marry Miss Abbott , even if her dowry is small . "
58887	58895	58896	58896	she	107	" When will you see him again ? "
58921	58957	58899	58899	They	1680	" I hope next spring . Perhaps we shall paint Siena red for a day or two with some of the new wife 's money . It was one of the arguments for marrying her . "
58958	58964	58965	58965	she	107	" He has no heart , "
58969	58981	58965	58965	she	107	" He does not really mind about the child at all . "
58982	59033	58899	58899	They	1680	" No ; you 're wrong . He does . He is unhappy , like the rest of us . But he does n't try to keep up appearances as we do . He knows that the things that have made him happy once will probably make him happy again - "
59034	59044	58965	58965	she	107	" He said he would never be happy again . "
59045	59094	58899	58899	They	1680	" In his passion . Not when he was calm . We English say it when we are calm - when we do not really believe it any longer . Gino is not ashamed of inconsistency . It is one of the many things I like him for . "
59095	59106	58965	58965	she	107	" Yes ; I was wrong . That is so . "
59107	59119	59121	59121	Philip	172	" He 's much more honest with himself than I am , "
59123	59153	59121	59121	Philip	172	" and he is honest without an effort and without pride . But you , Miss Abbott , what about you ? Will you be in Italy next spring ? "
59154	59157	58965	58965	she	107	" No . "
59158	59173	59121	59121	Philip	172	" I 'm sorry . When will you come back , do you think ? "
59174	59179	58965	58965	she	107	" I think never . "
59180	59185	59186	59186	He	172	" For whatever reason ? "
59197	59209	59186	59186	He	172	" Because I understand the place . There is no need . "
59210	59214	59215	59215	he	172	" Understand Italy ! "
59218	59221	59186	59186	He	172	" Perfectly . "
59222	59236	59240	59240	himself	172	" Well , I do n't . And I do n't understand you , "
59474	59480	59464	59464	She	102	" Are your plans decided ? "
59481	59491	59471	59471	her	102	" Yes . I ca n't live at Sawston . "
59492	59499	59464	59464	She	102	" Have you told Mrs. Herriton ? "
59500	59602	59471	59471	her	102	" I wrote from Monteriano . I tried to explain things ; but she will never understand me . Her view will be that the affair is settled - sadly settled since the baby is dead . Still it 's over ; our family circle need be vexed no more . She wo n't even be angry with you . You see , you have done us no harm in the long run . Unless , of course , you talk about Harriet and make a scandal . So that is my plan - London and work . What is yours ? "
59603	59607	59609	59610	Miss Abbott	107	" Poor Harriet ! "
59612	59623	59609	59610	Miss Abbott	107	" As if I dare judge Harriet ! Or anybody . "
59767	59776	59777	59777	he	172	" Is Harriet going to be all right ? "
59788	59797	59780	59781	Miss Abbott	107	" She will soon be her old self , "
59825	59828	59822	59822	She	217	" thoroughly upset "
59857	59862	59854	59854	she	217	" this unlucky accident , "
59864	59877	59854	59854	she	217	" the mysterious frustration of one 's attempts to make things better . "
59912	59938	59878	59879	Miss Abbott	107	" I 'm clear enough about Harriet 's future , and about parts of my own . But I ask again , What about yours ? "
59939	59944	59946	59947	Miss Abbott	107	" Sawston and work , "
59949	59952	59878	59879	Miss Abbott	107	" No . "
59953	59957	59958	59958	she	107	" Why not ? "
59963	59982	59878	59879	Miss Abbott	107	" You 've seen too much . You 've seen as much and done more than I have . "
59983	60035	59878	59879	Miss Abbott	107	" But it 's so different . Of course I shall go to Sawston . You forget my father ; and even if he was n't there , I 've a hundred ties : my district - I 'm neglecting it shamefully - my evening classes , the St. James ' - "
60036	60040	60041	60041	he	1697	" Silly nonsense ! "
60055	60106	60041	60041	he	1697	" You 're too good - about a thousand times better than I am . You ca n't live in that hole ; you must go among people who can hope to understand you . I mind for myself . I want to see you often - again and again . "
60107	60127	59878	59879	Miss Abbott	107	" Of course we shall meet whenever you come down ; and I hope that it will mean often . "
60128	60163	60041	60041	he	1697	" It 's not enough ; it 'll only be in the old horrible way , each with a dozen relatives round us . No , Miss Abbott ; it 's not good enough . "
60164	60172	59878	59879	Miss Abbott	107	" We can write at all events . "
60173	60178	60179	60179	he	1697	" You will write ? "
60196	60201	59878	59879	Miss Abbott	107	" I will indeed . "
60202	60230	59878	59879	Miss Abbott	107	" But I say it 's not enough - you ca n't go back to the old life if you wanted to . Too much has happened . "
60231	60236	60237	60237	she	1697	" I know that , "
60241	60290	59878	59879	Miss Abbott	107	" Not only pain and sorrow , but wonderful things : that tower in the sunlight - do you remember it , and all you said to me ? The theatre , even . And the next day - in the church ; and our times with Gino . "
60291	60299	60300	60300	she	1697	" All the wonderful things are over , "
60303	60311	60300	60300	she	1697	" That is just where it is . "
60312	60335	59878	59879	Miss Abbott	107	" I do n't believe it . At all events not for me . The most wonderful things may be to come - "
60336	60343	60344	60344	she	1697	" The wonderful things are over , "
60380	60384	60385	60385	he	1697	" Miss Abbott , "
60401	60569	60385	60385	he	1697	" what is the matter with you ? I thought I understood you , and I do n't . All those two great first days at Monteriano I read you as clearly as you read me still . I saw why you had come , and why you changed sides , and afterwards I saw your wonderful courage and pity . And now you 're frank with me one moment , as you used to be , and the next moment you shut me up . You see I owe too much to you - my life , and I do n't know what besides . I wo n't stand it . You 've gone too far to turn mysterious . I 'll quote what you said to me : ' Do n't be mysterious ; there is n't the time . ' I 'll quote something else : ' I and my life must be where I live . ' You ca n't live at Sawston . "
60583	60588	60577	60577	She	1703	" It is tempting - "
60675	60680	60681	60681	she	1703	" It is tempting , "
60684	60731	60681	60681	she	1703	" not to be mysterious . I 've wanted often to tell you , and then been afraid . I could never tell any one else , certainly no woman , and I think you 're the one man who might understand and not be disgusted . "
60732	60737	60738	60738	he	1702	" Are you lonely ? "
60741	60748	60738	60738	he	1702	" Is it anything like that ? "
60749	60752	60760	60760	her	1703	" Yes . "
60782	60801	60762	60762	He	1702	" I 'm terribly lonely , or I would n't speak . I think you must know already . "
60818	60823	60824	60824	He	1702	" Perhaps I do . "
60830	60861	60824	60824	He	1702	" Perhaps I could speak instead . But if you will say the word plainly you 'll never be sorry ; I will thank you for it all my life . "
60866	60872	60862	60862	She	1703	" That I love him . "
60908	60933	60906	60906	himself	1702	" Rather ! I love him too ! When I can forget how he hurt me that evening . Though whenever we shake hands - "
60958	60964	60965	60965	She	1703	" You 've upset me . "
60974	61018	60965	60965	She	1703	" I thought I was past all this . You 're taking it wrongly . I 'm in love with Gino - do n't pass it off - I mean it crudely - you know what I mean . So laugh at me . "
61019	61024	61026	61026	Philip	172	" Laugh at love ? "
61028	61126	61127	61127	She	1712	" Yes . Pull it to pieces . Tell me I 'm a fool or worse - that he 's a cad . Say all you said when Lilia fell in love with him . That 's the help I want . I dare tell you this because I like you - and because you 're without passion ; you look on life as a spectacle ; you do n't enter it ; you only find it funny or beautiful . So I can trust you to cure me . Mr. Herriton , is n't it funny ? "
61141	61190	61191	61191	She	1712	" He 's not a gentleman , nor a Christian , nor good in any way . He 's never flattered me nor honoured me . But because he 's handsome , that 's been enough . The son of an Italian dentist , with a pretty face . "
61204	61215	61191	61191	She	1712	" Oh , Mr. Herriton , is n't it funny ! "
61227	61267	61222	61222	she	1712	" I love him , and I 'm not ashamed of it . I love him , and I 'm going to Sawston , and if I may n't speak about him to you sometimes , I shall die . "
61338	61352	61353	61353	She	1712	" Perhaps it is what the books call ' a passing fancy ' ? "
61387	61394	61395	61395	she	1712	" If I saw him often , "
61398	61427	61395	61395	she	1712	" I might remember what he is like . Or he might grow old . But I dare not risk it , so nothing can alter me now . "
61428	61441	61445	61445	he	172	" Well , if the fancy does pass , let me know . "
61452	61461	61445	61445	he	172	" Oh , you shall know quick enough - "
61462	61476	61487	61487	He	172	" But before you retire to Sawston - are you so mighty sure ? "
61477	61481	61482	61482	She	1712	" What of ? "
61497	61503	61504	61504	He	172	" That you and he - "
61547	61561	61575	61575	her	1712	" I was going to say - whatever have you got in common ? "
61562	61573	61575	61575	her	1712	" Nothing except the times we have seen each other . "
61587	61593	61580	61580	He	172	" Which - which times ? "
61594	61759	61575	61575	her	1712	" The time I thought you weak and heedless , and went instead of you to get the baby . That began it , as far as I know the beginning . Or it may have begun when you took us to the theatre , and I saw him mixed up with music and light . But did n't understand till the morning . Then you opened the door - and I knew why I had been so happy . Afterwards , in the church , I prayed for us all ; not for anything new , but that we might just be as we were - he with the child he loved , you and I and Harriet safe out of the place - and that I might never see him or speak to him again . I could have pulled through then - the thing was only coming near , like a wreath of smoke ; it had n't wrapped me round . "
61760	61766	61768	61768	Philip	172	" But through my fault , "
61771	61799	61768	61768	Philip	172	" he is parted from the child he loves . And because my life was in danger you came and saw him and spoke to him again . "
61849	61900	61846	61846	her	1717	" Do n't talk of ' faults . ' You 're my friend for ever , Mr. Herriton , I think . Only do n't be charitable and shift or take the blame . Get over supposing I 'm refined . That 's what puzzles you . Get over that . "
61949	62019	61937	61937	she	1717	" I say again , do n't be charitable . If he had asked me , I might have given myself body and soul . That would have been the end of my rescue party . But all through he took me for a superior being - a goddess . I who was worshipping every inch of him , and every word he spoke . And that saved me . "
62126	62130	62134	62134	he	172	" Thank you , "
62138	62144	62134	62134	he	172	" Thank you for everything . "
