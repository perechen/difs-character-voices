2341	2348	2324	2336	The old man , who still sat impassively on the beer - barrel	441	" Ay ! What is it ? "
2349	2357	2382	2382	He	435	" Are you coming along with us ? "
2365	2377	2361	2361	his	87	" Why not ? It 's the last load this year ! "
2378	2381	2382	2382	He	435	" Ay ! "
2403	2412	2382	2382	He	435	" The last load ! The very last ! "
2571	2577	2554	2554	He	435	" Are you feeling kind ? "
2587	2593	2578	2578	Her	414	" I am always kind . "
2594	2609	2554	2554	He	435	" Not to me ! Not as kind as you are to that bird . "
2610	2622	2578	2578	Her	414	" Oh , poor Cupid ! You 're jealous of him ! "
2631	2636	2638	2638	he	435	" Perhaps I am ! "
2645	2682	2638	2638	he	435	" Perhaps I am , Innocent ! I grudge him the privilege of lying there on your dear little white breast ! I am envious when you kiss him ! I want you to kiss ME ! "
2701	2708	2709	2709	she	414	" I will if you like ! "
2712	2726	2709	2709	she	414	" I should think no more of kissing you than of kissing Cupid ! "
2736	2747	2748	2748	he	435	" I would n't be kissed at all that way , "
2753	2757	2810	2810	He	435	" Why not ? "
2758	2774	2820	2820	he	435	" Because it 's not the right way . A bird is not a man ! "
2779	2795	2796	2796	she	414	" Nor a man a bird , though he may have a bird 's name ! "
2799	2809	2796	2796	she	414	" Oh , Robin , how clever you are ! "
2814	2819	2820	2820	he	435	" Let Cupid go ! "
2821	2834	2874	2874	She	414	pleaded,--"I want to ride home on the last load with you alone . "
2843	2853	2854	2854	she	414	" I declare you think Cupid an actual person ! "
2857	2873	2854	2854	she	414	" If he 'll go , he shall . But I think he 'll stay . "
2905	2911	2912	2912	she	448	" I told you so ! "
2913	2918	2899	2899	She	414	said,--"He 's a fixture . "
2919	2930	2932	2932	Robin	84	" I do n't mind him so much up there , "
2945	2973	2935	2935	he	84	own,--"but he always has so much of you ; he nestles under your chin and is caressed by your sweet lips,--he has all , and I have,--nothing ! "
2974	2980	2982	2982	Innocent	152	" You have one hand , "
2988	2995	2996	2996	he	84	" But no heart with it ! "
3001	3010	2996	2996	he	84	" Innocent , can you never love me ? "
3025	3039	2996	2996	he	84	" I 'm afraid not ! But I have often thought about it . "
3040	3042	3043	3043	his	84	" You have?"--and
3049	3069	3070	3070	she	414	" Oh yes , often ! You see , it is n't your fault at all . You are -- well!"--here
3078	3165	3070	3070	she	414	admiration,--"you are quite a beautiful man ! You have a splendid figure and a good face , and kind eyes and well - shaped feet and hands,--and I like the look of you just now with that open collar and that gleam of sunlight in your curly hair -- and your throat is almost white , except for a touch of sunburn , which is RATHER becoming!--especially with that crimson silk tie ! I suppose you put that tie on for effect , did n't you ? "
3173	3180	3070	3070	she	414	" Naturally ! To please YOU ! "
3181	3211	3070	3070	she	414	" Really ? How thoughtful of you ! Well , you are charming,--and I should n't mind kissing you at all . But it would n't be for love . "
3212	3225	3070	3070	she	414	" Would n't it ? What would it be for , then ? "
3240	3247	3248	3248	she	414	" Only because you look pretty ! "
3263	3273	3274	3274	he	84	" You want to make a fool of me ! "
3279	3307	3251	3251	He	84	" I 'm sure I do n't ! You are just lovely , and I tell you so . That is not making a fool of you ! "
3308	3325	3251	3251	He	84	" Yes , it is ! A man is never lovely . A woman may be . "
3326	3333	3335	3335	Innocent	152	" Well , I 'm not , "
3339	3350	3335	3335	Innocent	152	" That 's why I admire the loveliness of others . "
3351	3358	3359	3359	he	84	" You are lovely to me , "
3377	3381	3382	3382	she	414	" Poor Robin ! "
3445	3451	3452	3452	he	450	" So you pity me ! "
3453	3459	3493	3493	He	450	said,--"Pity is akin to love . "
3460	3466	3467	3467	she	414	" But kinsfolk seldom agree , "
3470	3492	3467	3467	she	414	" I only pity you because you are foolish . No one but a very foolish fellow would think ME lovely . "
3576	3579	3580	3580	he	450	" There ! "
3596	3683	3580	3580	he	450	" Now you know how lovely you are to me ! I should like to kiss your mouth like that,--for you have the sweetest mouth in the world ! And you have the prettiest hair,--not raw gold which I hate,--but soft brown , with delicious little sunbeams lost in it,--and such a lot of it ! I 've seen it all down , remember ! And your eyes would draw the heart out of any man and send him anywhere,--yes , Innocent!--anywhere,--to Heaven or to Hell ! "
3689	3695	3696	3696	she	455	" That 's beautiful talk ! "
3697	3708	3684	3684	She	455	said,--"It 's like poetry , but it is n't true ! "
3709	3714	3715	3715	he	450	" It is true ! "
3722	3731	3715	3715	he	450	" And I 'll MAKE you love me ! "
3732	3737	3684	3684	She	455	" Ah , no ! "
3748	3781	3747	3747	her	455	features--"that 's not possible . You could never MAKE me do anything ! And -- it 's rude of you to speak in such a way . Please let go my hand ! "
3791	3803	3805	3805	he	450	" All right ! I 'll leave you to yourself,--and Cupid ! "
3810	3821	3805	3805	he	450	" What made you give that bird such a name ? "
3822	3830	3831	3831	she	455	" I found it in a book , "
3832	3851	3805	3805	he	450	answered,--"It 's a name that was given to the god of Love when he was a little boy . "
3852	3865	3867	3867	Robin	84	" I know that ! Please do n't teach me my A.B.C. , "
3882	3915	3873	3873	She	455	" Love was once a little boy , Heigh - ho , Heigh - ho ! Then ' twas sweet with him to toy , Heigh - ho , Heigh - ho ! "
3951	3960	3961	3961	he	84	" You might go on with the song , "
3962	3969	3945	3945	He	84	said,--"'Love is now a little man-- ' "
3970	3979	3980	3980	she	455	" ' And a very naughty one ! ' "
3997	4012	4013	4013	he	84	" Say what you like , Cupid is a ridiculous name for a dove , "
4016	4022	4023	4023	she	455	" It rhymes to stupid , "
4026	4040	4023	4023	she	455	demurely,--"And the rhyme expresses the nature of the bird and -- the god ! "
4041	4049	3990	3990	his	84	" Pooh ! You think that clever ! "
4050	4085	4023	4023	she	455	" I do n't ! I never said a clever thing in my life . I should n't know how . Everything clever has been written over and over again by people in books . "
4086	4090	4091	4091	he	84	" Hang books ! "
4094	4119	4091	4091	he	84	" It 's always books with you ! I wish we had never found that old chest of musty volumes in the panelled room . "
4120	4143	4023	4023	she	455	" Do you ? Then you are sillier than I thought you were . The books taught me all I know,--about love ! "
4144	4156	4157	4157	he	84	" About love ! You do n't know what love means ! "
4169	4229	4157	4157	he	84	" You read and read , and you get the queerest ideas into your head , and all the time the world goes on in ways that are quite different from what YOU are thinking about,--and lovers walk through the fields and lanes everywhere near us every year , and you never appear to see them or to envy them-- "
4230	4234	4235	4236	The girl	414	" Envy them ! "
4242	4269	4235	4236	The girl	414	" Envy them ! Oh , Cupid , hear ! Envy them ! Why should I envy them ? Who could envy Mr. and Mrs. Pettigrew ? "
4270	4276	4277	4277	he	457	" What nonsense you talk ! "
4278	4290	4235	4236	The girl	414	exclaimed,--"Mr . and Mrs. Pettigrew are married folk , not lovers ! "
4291	4298	4299	4299	she	414	" But they were lovers once , "
4300	4380	4235	4236	The girl	414	said,--"and only three years ago . I remember them , walking through the lanes and fields as you say , with arms round each other,--and Mrs. Pettigrew 's hands were always dreadfully red , and Mr. Pettigrew 's fingers were always dirty,--and they married very quickly,--and now they 've got two dreadful babies that scream all day and all night , and Mrs. Pettigrew 's hair is never tidy and Pettigrew himself -- well , you know what he does!-- "
4381	4387	4389	4389	Robin	84	" Gets drunk every night , "
4391	4404	4389	4389	Robin	84	crossly,--"I know ! And I suppose you think I 'm another Pettigrew ? "
4405	4411	4413	4413	she	414	" Oh dear , no ! "
4420	4450	4413	4413	she	414	" You never could , you never would be a Pettigrew ! But it all comes to the same thing -- love ends in marriage , does n't it ? "
4451	4456	4458	4458	Robin	84	" It ought to , "
4462	4470	4389	4389	Robin	84	" And marriage ends -- in Pettigrews ! "
4471	4474	4389	4389	Robin	84	" Innocent ! "
4475	4515	4389	4389	Robin	84	" Do n't say ' Innocent ' in that reproachful way ! It makes me feel quite guilty ! Now,--if you talk of names,--THERE 'S a name to give a poor girl,--Innocent ! Nobody ever heard of such a name-- "
4516	4534	4536	4536	Robin	84	" You 're wrong . There were thirteen Popes named Innocent between the years 402 and 1724 , "
4538	4560	4536	4536	Robin	84	promptly,--"and one of them , Innocent the Eleventh , is a character in Browning 's ' Ring and the Book . ' "
4561	4565	4567	4567	her	414	" Dear me ! "
4572	4615	4567	4567	her	414	" You astound me with your wisdom , Robin ! But all the same , I do n't believe any girl ever had such a name as Innocent , in spite of thirteen Popes . And perhaps the Thirteen had other names ? "
4616	4623	4624	4624	he	84	" They had other baptismal names , "
4632	4665	4624	4624	he	84	" For instance , Pope Innocent the Third was Cardinal Lothario before he became Pope , and he wrote a book called ' De Contemptu Mundi sive de Miseria Humanae Conditionis ! ' "
4700	4706	4707	4707	she	414	" Oh Robin , Robin ! "
4708	4777	4666	4666	She	414	cried--"You are simply delicious ! The most enchanting boy ! That crimson tie and that Latin ! No wonder the village girls adore you ! ' De,'--what is it ? ' Contemptu Mundi , ' and Misery Human Conditions ! Poor Pope ! He never sat on top of a hay - load in his life I 'm sure ! But you see his name was Lothario,--not Innocent . "
4778	4785	4787	4787	Robin	84	" His baptismal name was Lothario , "
4796	4807	4808	4808	she	414	" Well ! I suppose _ I _ was baptised ? "
4815	4820	4787	4787	Robin	84	" I suppose so . "
4821	4836	4837	4837	Robin	84	" I wonder if I have any other name ? I must ask Dad . "
4883	4894	4880	4880	her	458	" Mister Jocelyn ! Mister Jocelyn ! You 're wanted ! "
4895	4903	4904	4904	he	84	" There 's Priscilla calling Uncle in , "
4917	4926	4914	4914	he	84	" Hullo , Priscilla ! What is it ? "
4942	4952	4937	4938	the wearer	461	" Doctor 's come ! Wantin ' yer Uncle ! "
5046	5049	5050	5050	she	152	" Dad ! "
5051	5057	5060	5060	his	84	called--"Dad , shall I come ? "
5065	5080	5060	5060	his	84	" No , lass , no ! Stay where you are , with Robin . "
5153	5171	5133	5133	her	103	" Well ! Ye're a fine couple up there ! What are ye a - doin' of ? "
5172	5180	5182	5182	Robin	84	" Never mind what we 're doing , "
5186	5201	5182	5182	Robin	84	" I say , Priscilla , do you think Uncle Hugo is really ill ? "
5232	5238	5239	5239	she	103	" He ai n't hisself , "
5244	5247	5249	5249	Innocent	152	" No , "
5251	5257	5249	5249	Innocent	152	seriously,--"I'm sure he is n't . "
5275	5286	5287	5287	she	103	" He ai n't been hisself for this past year , "
5289	5393	5287	5287	she	103	on--"Mr . Slowton , bein ' only a kind of village physic - bottle , do n't know much , an ' yer uncle ai n't bin satisfied . Now there 's another doctor from London staying up ' ere for ' is own poor ' elth , and yer Uncle said he 'd like to ' ave ' is opinion,--so Mr. Slowton , bein ' obligin ' though ignorant , ' as got ' i m in to see yer Uncle , and there they both is , in the best parlour , with special wine an ' seedies on the table . "
5394	5403	5405	5405	Robin	84	" Oh , it 'll be all right ! "
5407	5423	5405	5405	Robin	84	cheerfully,--"Uncle Hugo is getting old , of course , and he 's a bit fanciful . "
5429	5445	5424	5424	Priscilla	103	" Mebbe -- and mebbe not ! What are you two waitin ' for now ? "
5446	5462	5287	5287	she	103	" For the men to come back with Roger . Then we 'll haul home . "
5463	5479	5424	5424	Priscilla	103	" You 'll ' ave to wait a bit longer , I 'm thinkin ' , "
5481	5541	5287	5287	she	103	Priscilla--"They 's all drinkin ' beer in the yard now an ' tappin ' another barrel to drink at when the waggon comes in . There 's no animals on earth as ever thirsty as men ! Well , good luck t'ye ! I must go , or there 'll be a smell of burnin ' supper - cakes . "
5602	5609	5610	5610	she	103	" Dad is really not well , "
5615	5627	5610	5610	she	103	" I feel anxious about him . If he were to die,-- "
5638	5645	5647	5647	Robin	84	" He must die some day , "
5649	5656	5647	5647	Robin	84	gently,--"and he 's old,--nigh on eighty . "
5657	5668	5669	5669	she	103	" Oh , I do n't want to remember that , "
5672	5722	5669	5669	she	103	" It 's the cruellest part of life -- that people should grow old , and die , and pass away from us . What should I do without Dad ? I should be all alone , with no one in the world to care what becomes of me . "
5723	5729	5730	5730	he	84	" _ I _ care ! "
5735	5742	5647	5647	Robin	84	" Yes , you care -- just now"--she
5749	5773	5647	5647	Robin	84	" and it 's very kind of you . I wish I could care -- in the way you want me to -- but-- "
5774	5779	5780	5780	he	84	" Will you try ? "
5783	5794	5795	5795	she	472	" I do try -- really I do try hard , "
5802	5810	5811	5811	she	472	earnestness,--"but I ca n't feel what is n't HERE,"--and
5817	5853	5854	5854	she	472	breast--"I care more for Roger the horse , and Cupid the dove , than I do for you ! It 's quite awful of me -- but there it is ! I love -- I simply adore"--and
5862	5953	5811	5811	she	472	gesture--"all the trees and plants and birds!--and everything about the farm and the farmhouse itself -- it 's just the sweetest home in the world ! There 's not a brick or a stone in it that I would not want to kiss if I had to leave it -- but I never felt that way for you ! And yet I like you very , very much , Robin!--I wish I could see you married to some nice girl , only I do n't know one really nice enough . "
5954	5959	5960	5960	he	473	" Nor do I ! "
5967	6002	5960	5960	he	473	" except yourself ! But never mind , dear!--we wo n't talk of it any more , just now at any rate . I 'm a patient sort of chap . I can wait ! "

6016	6021	6022	6022	he	473	" All my life ! "
6248	6269	6239	6240	the man	481	" All my life I shall love you , Innocent ! Whatever happens , remember that ! All my life ! "

6328	6354	6292	6292	his	481	cried,--"bless his heart ! Now , Robin , you must try to look very stately ! Are you going to ride home standing or sitting ? "
6364	6388	6389	6389	he	481	" Unless I may sit beside you with my arm round your waist , in the Pettigrew fashion , I 'd rather stand ! "
6392	6430	6389	6389	he	481	" You said Pettigrew 's hands were always dirty -- so are mine . I 'd better keep my distance from you . One ca n't make hay and remain altogether as clean as a new pin ! "
6437	6448	6449	6449	she	152	" You always take things up in the wrong way , "
6450	6466	6511	6511	he	481	said--"I never thought you a bit like Pettigrew ! Your hands are not really dirty ! "
6467	6471	6472	6472	he	481	" They are ! "
6477	6493	6472	6472	he	481	" Besides , you do n't want my arm round your waist , do you ? "
6494	6498	6499	6499	she	152	" Certainly not ! "
6504	6510	6511	6511	he	481	" Then I 'll stand , "
6512	6532	6533	6533	He	481	said;--"You shall be enthroned like a queen and I 'll be your bodyguard . Here , wait a minute ! "
6606	6614	6615	6615	he	481	" Looks prutty , do n't it ? "
6625	6646	6618	6618	She	414	" Is it for me ? Oh , Larry , how nice of you ! Am I to wear it ? "
6647	6652	6615	6615	he	481	" If ye loike ! "
6814	6825	6826	6826	they	436	" Good luck to the last load , Mr. Clifford ! "
6829	6836	6838	6838	Robin	84	" Good luck to you all ! "
6842	6849	6851	6851	they	436	" Good luck t'ye , Miss ! "
6868	6881	6851	6851	they	436	" As fine a crop and as fair a load next year ! "
6882	6888	6889	6889	she	414	" Good luck to you ! "
6903	6929	6898	6898	she	414	" Please wish luck to Dad ! He 's not well -- and he is n't here ! Oh , please do n't forget him ! "
6954	6981	6946	6946	they	436	" That 's right , Miss ! Good luck to the master ! Many good years of life to him , and better crops every year ! "
7218	7226	7228	7243	one tall , powerful - looking man who seemed to be a leader among the others	499	" Have a drop , Mr. Clifford ! "
7265	7273	7274	7274	he	86	" Just to your health , Landon ! "
7275	7281	7228	7243	one tall , powerful - looking man who seemed to be a leader among the others	499	said--"I'm not a drinking man . "
7282	7288	7290	7291	the other	501	" Haymaking 's thirsty work , "
7293	7302	7290	7291	the other	501	" Will Miss Jocelyn do us the honour ? "
7311	7321	7322	7322	she	503	" I do n't like beer , Mr. Landon , "
7323	7345	7290	7291	the other	501	said--"It 's horrid stuff , even when it 's home - brewed ! I help to make it , you see ! "
7442	7449	7450	7450	she	414	" I 'll go in now , "
7451	7459	7435	7435	She	414	said--"Dad must be alone by this time . "
7460	7464	7466	7466	Robin	84	" All right ! "
7553	7558	7559	7559	he	112	" There you are ! "
7564	7604	7559	7559	he	112	laugh--"When you get into the house you can tell Uncle that you are a Rose Queen , a Hay Queen , and Queen of everything and everyone on Briar Farm , including your very humble servant , Robin Clifford ! "
7605	7615	7617	7617	Landon	112	" And your humblest of slaves , Ned Landon ! "
7628	7642	7617	7617	Landon	112	" Mr. Clifford must n't expect to have it all his own way ! "
7643	7652	7654	7654	Robin	84	" What the devil are you talking about ? "
7671	7678	7679	7679	she	152	" Don't!--Oh , do n't quarrel ! "
7754	7758	7759	7759	he	112	" Mr. Clifford , "
7765	7798	7759	7759	he	112	" you heard what I said just now ? You must n't expect to have it all your own way ! There 's other men after the girl as well as you ! "
7806	7812	7813	7813	he	84	" Yourself , I suppose ? "
7816	7821	7823	7823	Landon	112	" And why not ? "
7825	7836	7838	7838	Clifford	84	" Only because there are two sides to every question , "
7846	7859	7838	7838	Clifford	84	" And no decision can be arrived at till both are heard ! "
7889	7929	7860	7860	He	84	" Yonder comes a courteous knight , Lustily raking over the hay , He was well aware of a bonny lass , As she came wandering over the way . Then she sang Downe a downe , hey downe derry !
7930	7979	7860	7860	He	84	" Jove you speed , fair ladye , he said , Among the leaves that be so greene , If I were a king and wore a crown , Full soon faire Ladye shouldst thou be queene . Then she sang Downe a downe , hey downe derry ! "
7990	7998	7999	7999	he	112	" Those laugh best who laugh last ! "
8002	8015	7999	7999	he	112	" And a whistling throstle has had its neck wrung before now ! "
8089	8102	8103	8103	she	152	" Ah ! YOU'LL never come to much good , Jenny Spinner , "
8106	8229	8103	8103	she	152	" What with a muck of dirty dishes in one corner and a muddle of ragged clouts in another , you 're the very model of a wife for a farm hand ! Ca n't sew a gown for yerself neither , but bound to send it into town to be made for ye , and could n't put a button on a pair of breeches for fear of ' urtin ' yer delicate fingers ! Well ! God ' elp ye when the man comes as ye're lookin ' for ! He 'll be a fool anyhow , for all men are that,--but he 'll be twice a fool if he takes you for a life - satchel on his shoulders ! "
8283	8290	8291	8291	she	116	" Priscilla , where 's Dad ? "
8294	8353	8260	8260	she	116	" Lord save us , lovey ! You gave me a real scare coming in like that with them roses on yer head like a pixie out of the woods ! The master ? He 's just where the doctors left ' i m , sittin ' in his easy - chair and looking out o ' window . "
8354	8367	8369	8370	the girl	414	" Was it -- was it all right , do you think ? "
8374	8521	8260	8260	she	116	" Now , lovey , do n't ask me about doctors , 'cos I do n't know nothin' and wants to know nothin' , for they be close - tongued folk who never sez what they thinks lest they get their blessed selves into hot water . And whether it 's all right or all wrong , I could n't tell ye , for the two o ' them went out together , and Mr. Slowton sez ' Good - arternoon , Miss Friday ! ' quite perlite like , and the other gentleman he lifts ' is ' at quite civil , so I should say ' twas all wrong . For if you mark me , lovey , men 's allus extra perlite when they thinks there 's goin' to be trouble , hopin ' they 'll get somethin' for theirselves out of it . "
8531	8538	8539	8539	she	152	" I 'm going to Dad , "
8829	8832	8833	8833	she	152	" Dad ! "
8843	8852	8838	8838	He	532	" Ay , lass ! What is it ? "
8898	8905	8895	8895	he	532	" Last load in all safe ? "
8906	8911	8895	8895	he	532	" Yes , Dad ! "
8912	8932	8895	8895	he	532	" Not a drop of rain to wet it , and no hard words to toughen it , eh ? "
8933	8938	8895	8895	he	532	" No , Dad . "
8968	8974	8954	8954	He	532	" Been quarrelling with Robin ? "
8975	8988	8954	8954	He	532	" Dear Dad , no ! We 're the best of friends . "
9003	9026	8989	8989	He	532	" That 's right ! That 's as it should be ! Be friends with Robin , child ! Be friends!--be lovers ! "
9072	9078	9062	9062	He	532	" Did Robin crown thee ? "
9085	9094	9079	9079	She	152	" No , it 's Larry 's wreath . "
9095	9127	9079	9079	She	152	" Larry ! Ay , poor Larry ! A good lad -- but he can eat for two and only work for one . ' Tis the way of men nowadays ! "
9146	9149	9151	9152	the girl	414	" Dad , "
9158	9169	9151	9152	the girl	414	tone--"Do tell me -- what did the London doctor say ? "
9194	9240	9172	9172	his	532	" Say ! What should he say , lass , but that I am old and must expect to die ? It 's natural enough -- only I have n't thought about it . It 's just that -- I have n't thought about it ! "
9241	9249	9250	9250	she	414	" Why should you think about it ? "
9255	9278	9250	9250	she	414	tenderness--"You will not die yet -- not for many years . You are not so very old . And you are strong . "
9285	9290	9291	9291	he	532	" Poor little wilding ! "
9292	9326	9279	9279	He	532	said--"If you had your way I should live for ever , no doubt ! But an ' you were wise with modern wisdom , you would say I had already lived too long ! "
9339	9348	9349	9349	she	414	" I do not want any modern wisdom , "
9350	9360	9330	9330	she	414	said--"I am your little girl and I love you ! "
9378	9385	9372	9372	She	414	" You will not tell me ? "
9386	9391	9349	9349	she	414	" Tell you what ? "
9392	9400	9372	9372	She	414	" All that the London doctor said . "
9414	9438	9411	9411	he	532	" Yes , I will tell you , but not now . To - night after supper will be time enough . And then-- "
9439	9444	9445	9445	she	414	" Yes -- then ? "
9450	9461	9411	9411	he	532	" Then you shall know -- you will have to know-- "
9468	9471	9463	9463	he	532	" Innocent ! "
9472	9477	9411	9411	he	532	" Yes , Dad ? "
9478	9485	9463	9463	he	532	" How old are you now ? "
9486	9489	9411	9411	he	532	" Eighteen . "
9490	9497	9499	9499	he	532	" Ay , so you are ! "
9505	9519	9499	9499	he	532	" Quite a woman ! Time flies ! You 're old enough to learn-- "
9520	9528	9529	9529	she	414	" I have always tried to learn , "
9530	9538	9499	9499	he	532	said--"and I like studying things out of books-- "
9539	9556	9557	9557	he	532	" Ay ! But there are worse things in life than ever were written in books , "
9560	9603	9557	9557	he	532	wearily--"things that people hide away and are ashamed to speak of ! Ay , poor wilding ! Things that I 've tried to keep from you as long as possible -- but -- time presses , and , I shall have to speak-- "
9621	9628	9629	9629	she	414	" Have I done anything wrong ? "
9632	9687	9744	9744	His	536	" You ? No ! Not you ! You are not to blame , child ! But you 've heard the law set out in church on Sundays that ' The sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children even unto the third and fourth generation . ' You 've heard that ? "
9688	9693	9744	9744	His	536	" Yes , Dad ! "
9694	9743	9744	9744	His	536	" Ay!--and who dare say the fourth generation are to blame ! Yet , though they are guiltless , they suffer most ! No just God ever made such a law , though they say ' tis God speaking . _ I _ say ' tis the devil ! "
9775	9783	9759	9759	he	536	" I say ' tis the devil ! "
9800	9805	9806	9806	she	414	" There , Dad ! "
9808	9860	9806	9806	she	414	soothingly,--"Don't worry ! Church and church things seem to rub you up all the wrong way ! Do n't think about them ! Supper will be ready in a little while and after supper we 'll have a long talk . And then you 'll tell me what the doctor said . "
9874	9892	9806	9806	she	414	" Ay ! After supper . Then -- then I 'll tell you what the doctor said . "
10131	10139	10140	10140	he	536	" How fast the hours go by ! "
10145	10196	10140	10140	he	536	" When we 're young they do n't count -- but when we 're old we know that every hour brings us nearer to the end - the end , the end of all ! Another night closing in -- and the last load cleared from the field -- Innocent ! "
10216	10225	10210	10210	she	545	" Dad , dear , what is it ? "
10236	10241	10242	10242	he	536	" Nothing -- nothing ! "
10250	10328	10246	10246	his	536	hard--"Nothing , lass ! No pain -- no -- not that ! I 'm only frightened ! Frightened!--think of it!--me frightened who never knew fear ! And I -- I would n't tell it to anyone but you -- I'm afraid of what 's coming -- of what 's bound to come ! ' Twould always have come , I know -- but I never thought about it -- it never seemed real ! It never seemed real-- "
10350	10359	10346	10347	Robin Clifford	84	" Hullo , Uncle ! Supper 's ready ! "
10393	10406	10386	10386	he	536	" All right , my lad ! You 've worked pretty late ! "
10407	10424	10446	10448	the old farmer	544	" Yes , and we 've not done yet . But we shall finish stacking tomorrow , "
10426	10435	10386	10386	he	536	Clifford--"Just now we 're all tired and hungry . "
10436	10444	10446	10448	the old farmer	544	" Do n't say you 're thirsty ! "
10454	10465	10446	10448	the old farmer	544	" How many barrels have been tapped to - day ? "
10466	10475	10476	10476	Clifford	84	" Oh , well ! You 'd better ask Landon,"--and
10486	10504	10476	10476	Clifford	84	it,--"he 's the man for the beer ! I hardly ever touch it -- Innocent knows that . "
10505	10515	10517	10517	Jocelyn	113	" More work 's done on water after all , "
10519	10577	10578	10578	he	84	" The horses that draw for us and the cattle that make food for us prove that . But we think we 're a bit higher than the beasts , and some of us get drunk to prove it ! That 's one of our strange ways as men ! Come along , lad ! And you , child,"--here
10581	10593	10611	10611	he	84	Innocent--"run and tell Priscilla we 're waiting in the Great Hall . "

11454	11524	11447	11447	he	582	difficulty,--"That 's what I says , boys ! Be eddicated ! Then everything 's right for us ! We can kick all the rich out into the mud and take their goods and enjoy 'em for ourselves . Eddication does it ! Makes us all we wants to be,--members o ' Parli'ment and what not ! I 've only one boy,--but he 'll be eddicated as his father never was-- "
11525	11533	11535	11535	Robin	84	" And learn to despise his father ! "
11551	11572	11539	11539	his	84	" You 're right ! That 's the best way to train a boy in the way he should go ! "
11595	11606	11607	11607	he	112	" I do n't agree with you , Mr. Clifford , "
11608	11623	11539	11539	his	84	said--"There 's no reason why a well - educated lad should despise his father . "
11624	11630	11607	11607	he	112	" But he often does , "
11632	11637	11539	11539	his	84	Robin--"reason or no reason . "
11638	11646	11648	11648	Landon	112	" Well , you 're educated yourself , "
11654	11671	11648	11648	Landon	112	envy,--"You won a scholarship at your grammar school , and you 've been to a University . "
11672	11680	11682	11682	Robin	84	" What 's that done for me ? "
11684	11712	11682	11682	Robin	84	carelessly,--"Where has it put me ? Just nowhere , but exactly where I might have stood all the time . I did n't learn farming at Oxford ! "
11713	11730	11732	11736	one of the farm hands	584	" But you did n't learn to despise your father either , did you , sir ? "
11740	11746	11748	11748	Robin	84	" My father 's dead , "
11750	11756	11748	11748	Robin	84	curtly,--"and I honour his memory . "
11757	11767	11769	11769	Landon	112	" So your own argument goes to the wall ! "
11771	11782	11769	11769	Landon	112	" Education has not made you think less of him . "
11783	11790	11748	11748	Robin	84	" In my case , no , "
11792	11843	11769	11769	Landon	112	Robin,--"but in dozens of other cases it works out differently . Besides , you 've got to decide what education IS . The man who knows how to plough a field rightly is as usefully educated as the man who knows how to read a book , in my opinion . "
11844	11847	11748	11748	Robin	84	" Education , "
11853	11872	11748	11748	Robin	84	" is first to learn one 's place in the world and then know how to keep it ! "
11896	11903	11904	11904	he	84	" What 's called education nowadays , "
11907	11954	11904	11904	he	84	" is a mere smattering and does no good . The children are taught , especially in small villages like ours , by men and women who often know less than the children themselves . What do you make of Danvers , for example , boys ? "
11964	11967	11969	11980	a huge red - faced fellow at the other end of the	586	" Danvers ! "
11981	12031	11969	11980	a huge red - faced fellow at the other end of the	586	board,--"Why he talks yer ' ead off about what he 's picked up here and there like , and when I asked him to tell me where my son is as went to Mexico , blowed if he did n't say it was a town somewheres near New York ! "
12051	12062	12063	12063	he	587	" Mr. Danvers is a teacher selected by the Government , "
12071	12098	12063	12063	he	587	" And if he teaches us that Mexico is a town near New York , we poor ignorant farm - folk are bound to believe him ! "
12108	12279	12105	12105	he	587	" I 'm old enough , boys , to have seen many changes , and I tell you , all things considered , that the worst change is the education business , so far as the strength and the health of the country goes . That , and machine work . When I was a youngster , nearly every field - hand knew how to mow,--now we 've trouble enough to find an extra man who can use a scythe . And you may put a machine on the grass as much as you like , you 'll never get the quality that you 'll get with a well - curved blade and a man 's arm and hand wielding it . Longer work maybe , and risk of rain -- but , taking the odds for and against , men are better than machines . Forty years we 've scythed the grass on Briar Farm , and have n't we had the finest crops of hay in the county ? "
12288	12294	12105	12105	he	587	" Ay , Mister Jocelyn ! "
12295	12300	12105	12105	he	587	" That 's right ! "
12301	12321	12323	12324	one man	582	" I never ' member more'n two wet seasons and then we got last load in ' tween showers , "
12328	12353	12355	12355	another	591	" There ai n't never been nothin' wrong with Briar Farm hay crops anyway -- all the buyers knows that for thirty mile round , "
12357	12373	12376	12378	the old farmer	544	" And the wheat and the corn and the barley and the oats the same , "

12429	12434	12376	12378	the old farmer	544	" Ay , ay ! "
12435	12444	12376	12378	the old farmer	544	" Never a day out o ' work ! "

12456	12633	12454	12454	Jocelyn	102	" if the old ways were kept up and work done in the old fashion , there 'd be plenty for all England 's men to do , and to feed fair and hearty ! But the idea nowadays is to rush everything just to get finished with it , and then to play cards or football , and get drunk till the legs do n't know whether it 's land or water they 're standing on ! It 's the wrong way about , boys ! It 's the wrong way about ! You may hurry and scurry along as fast as you please , but you miss most good things by the way ; and there 's only one end to your racing -- the grave ! There 's no such haste to drop into THAT , boys ! It 'll wait ! It 's always waiting ! And the quicker you go the quicker you 'll get to it ! Take time while you 're young ! That time for me is past ! "
12722	12728	12729	12729	she	121	" Now , lovey child ! "
12730	12804	12805	12805	Innocent	152	whispered,--"Don't take on ! It 's only the doctors that 's made him low like and feelin ' blue , and he ai n't takin ' sup or morsel , but we 'll make him have a bite in his own room afterwards . Do n't you swell your pretty eyes and make 'em red , for that wo n't suit me nor Mr. Robin neither , come , come!--that it wo n't ! "
12848	12858	12859	12859	he	597	" The time for good farming is never past ! "

12940	12948	12912	12913	Ned Landon	112	" To Briar Farm and the master ! "
12949	12955	12859	12859	he	597	" Health and good luck ! "

13150	13361	13362	13362	he	602	" Boys , I thank you ! You 're all boys to me , young and old , for you 've worked on the farm so long that I seem to know your faces as well as I know the shape of the land and the trees on the ridges . You 've wished me health and long life -- and I take it that your wishes are honest -- but I 've had a long life already and must n't expect much more of it . However , the farm will go on just the same whether I 'm here or elsewhere,--and no man that works well on it will be turned away from it,--that I can promise you ! And the advice I 've always given to you I give to you again,--stick to the land and the work of the land ! There 's nothing finer in the world than the fresh air and the scent of the good brown earth that gives you the reward of your labour , always providing it is labour and not ' scamp ' service . When I 'm gone you 'll perhaps remember what I say,--and think it not so badly said either . I thank you for your good wishes and"--here
13363	13427	13428	13428	He	602	hesitated--"my little girl here thanks you too . Next time you make the hay -- if I 'm not with you -- I ask you to be as merry as you are to - night and to drink to my memory ! For whenever one master of Briar Farm has gone there 's always been another in his place!--and there always will be ! "
13448	13472	13441	13441	he	602	contents--"God bless you all ! May you long have the will to work and the health to enjoy the fruits of honest labour ! "
13489	13493	13428	13428	He	602	" A song ! "
13494	13498	13428	13428	He	602	" A song ! "
13499	13504	13428	13428	He	602	" Who 'll begin ? "
13505	13510	13428	13428	He	602	" Where 's Steevy ? "
13511	13515	13428	13428	He	602	" Little Steevy ! "
13516	13525	13428	13428	He	602	" Steevy ! Wheer be ye got to ? "
13538	13552	13527	13538	one old fellow with very white hair and a very red face--"ye're	2913	face--"ye're not so small as ye can hide in yer mother 's thimble ! "
13572	13577	13629	13629	he	602	" Here I be ! "
13578	13587	13629	13629	he	602	" Sing away , lad , sing away ! "
13588	13596	13629	13629	he	602	" Wet yer pipe , and whistle ! "
13597	13604	13629	13629	he	602	" Tune up , my blackbird ! "
13639	13684	13629	13629	he	602	" Would you choose a wife For a happy life , Leave the town and the country take ; Where Susan and Doll , And Jenny and Moll , Follow Harry and John , While harvest goes on , And merrily , merrily rake ! "
13685	13734	13629	13629	he	602	" The lass give me here , As brown as my beer , That knows how to govern a farm ; That can milk a cow , Or farrow a sow , Make butter and cheese , And gather green peas , And guard the poultry from harm . "
13735	13781	13629	13629	he	602	" This , this is the girl , Worth rubies and pearl , The wife that a home will make ! We farmers need No quality breed , But a woman that 's won While harvest goes on , And we merrily , merrily rake ! "
13801	13819	13629	13629	he	602	" A woman that 's won While harvest goes on , And we merrily , merrily rake . "
13820	13823	13629	13629	he	602	" Bravo ! "
13824	13831	13629	13629	he	602	" Good for you , Steevy ! "
13832	13837	13629	13629	he	602	" First - class ! "
13838	13847	13629	13629	he	602	" Here 's to you , my lad ! "
13886	13924	13875	13875	all	604	" A glass is good and a lass is good , And a pipe is good in cold weather , The world is good and the people are good , And we 're all good fellows together ! "
14388	14396	14382	14382	she	152	" Do you want anything , Dad ? "
14411	14432	14397	14397	He	605	" Ay -- just help me to get this off . The working day is over,--the working clothes can go ! "
14620	14626	14627	14627	Jocelyn	120	" going with the times , "
14809	14836	14788	14788	she	152	" Poor little child , thou hast eaten no supper ! I saw thee playing with the bread and touching no morsel . Art not well ? "
14861	14870	14871	14871	she	152	" Dear Dad , I am only anxious , "
14876	14902	14871	14871	she	152	" You , too , have had nothing . Shall I fetch you a glass of the old wine ? It will do you good . "
14912	14920	14921	14921	he	605	" Presently -- presently -- not now , "
14924	14977	14921	14921	he	605	" Come and sit by me at the window and I 'll tell you -- I'll tell you what you must know . But see you , child , if you are going to cry or fret , you will be no help to me and I 'll just hold my peace ! "
14989	14995	14996	14996	she	152	" I will not cry , "
14997	15008	14978	14978	She	152	said,--"I will not fret . I promise you , Dad ! "
15030	15037	15044	15044	he	625	" That 's a brave girl ! "
15050	15147	15044	15044	he	625	window--"Look out there ! See how the stars shine ! Always the same , no matter what happens to us poor folk down here,--they twinkle as merrily over our graves as over our gardens,--and yet if we 're to believe what we 're taught nowadays , they 're all worlds more or less like our own , full of living creatures that suffer and die like ourselves . It 's a queer plan of the Almighty , to keep on making wonderful and beautiful things just to destroy them ! There seems no sense in it ! "
15221	15232	15233	15233	he	625	" You want to know what the London doctor said , "
15236	15314	15233	15233	he	625	" Well , child , you 'll not be any the better for knowing , but it 's as I thought . I 've got my death - warrant . Slowton was not sure about me,--but this man , ill as he is himself , has had too much experience to make mistakes . There 's no cure for me . I may last out another twelve months -- perhaps not so long -- certainly not longer . "
15352	15359	15360	15360	she	152	" I do n't believe it , "
15366	15371	15360	15360	she	152	emphasis--"I WON'T believe it ! "
15383	15442	15443	15443	he	625	" You wo n't ? Poor little girl , you must believe it!--and more than that , you must be prepared for it . Even a year 's none too much for all that has to be done,--'twill almost take me that time to look the thing square in the face and give up the farm for good . "--Here
15453	15468	15451	15451	his	625	words--"Give up the farm!--My God ! And for ever ! How strange it seems ! "
15478	15551	15372	15372	He	625	" Dad , dear ! Dad ! It is n't true ! Do n't think it ! Do n't mind what the doctor says . He 's wrong -- I'm sure he 's wrong ! You 'll live for many and many a happy year yet -- oh yes , Dad , you will ! I 'm sure of it ! You wo n't die , darling Dad ! Why should you ? "
15562	15567	15568	15568	he	625	" Why should I ? "
15576	15686	15568	15568	he	625	" Ah!--that 's more than I can tell you ! There 's neither rhyme nor reason in it that I can see . But it 's the rule of life that it should end in death . For some the end is swift -- for some it 's slow -- some know when it 's coming -- some don't,--the last are the happiest . I 've been told , you see,--and it 's no use my fighting against the fact,--a year at the most , perhaps less , is the longest term I have of Briar Farm . Your eyes are wet -- you promised you would n't cry . "
15708	15716	15717	15717	she	152	" I 'm not crying , Dad , "
15720	15728	15730	15730	she	152	" There 's nothing to cry for , "
15736	15779	15735	15735	her	152	own--"The doctors are wrong . You 're only a little weak and run down -- you'll be all right with rest and care -- and -- and you sha n't die ! You sha n't die ! I wo n't let you . "
15801	15807	15808	15808	he	625	" That 's foolish talk , "
15815	15850	15808	15808	he	625	" You 've got trouble to meet , and you must meet it . I 'm bound to show you trouble -- but I can show you a way out of it as well . "
15879	15888	15889	15889	he	625	" The first thing I must tell you , "
15893	15908	15889	15889	he	625	" is about yourself . It 's time you should know who you are . "
15916	15921	15922	15922	she	627	" Who I am ? "
15967	15975	15976	15976	he	625	" Now hear me out , child ! "
15977	16126	15958	15958	He	625	said--"Let me speak on without interruption , or I shall never get through the tale . Perhaps I ought to have told you before , but I 've put it off and put it off , thinking ' twould be time enough when you and Robin were we d. You and Robin -- you and Robin!--your marriage bells have rung through my brain many and many a night for the past two years and never a bit nearer are you to the end of your wooing , such fanciful children as you both are ! And you 're so long about it and I 've so short a time before me that I 've made up my mind it 's best to let you have all the truth about yourself before anything happens to me . All the truth about yourself -- as far as I know it . "
16235	16246	16247	16247	he	628	" It was eighteen years ago this very haymaking time , "
16262	16768	16258	16258	he	628	himself,--"The last load had been taken in . Supper was over . The men had gone home,--Priscilla was clearing the great hall , when there came on a sudden storm -- just a flash of lightning -- I can see it now , striking a blue fork across the windows -- a clap of thunder -- and then a regular downpour of rain . Heavy rain , too,--buckets - full -- for it washed the yard out and almost swamped the garden . I did n't think much about it,--the hay was hauled in dry , and that was all my concern . I stood under a shed in the yard and watched the rain falling in straight sheets out of a sky black as pitch -- I could scarcely see my own hand if I stretched it out before me , the night was so dark . All at once I heard the quick gallop of a horse 's hoofs some way off,--then the sound seemed to die away,--but presently I heard the hoofs coming at a slow steady pace down our muddy old by - road -- no one can gallop THAT , in any weather . And almost before I knew how it came there , the horse was standing at the farmyard gate , with a man in the saddle carrying a bundle in front of him . He was the handsomest fellow I ever saw , and when he dismounted and came towards me , and took off his cap in the pouring rain and smiled at me , I was fairly taken with his looks . I thought he must be something of a king or other great personage by his very manner . ' Will you do me a kindness ? ' he said , as gently as you please . ' This is a farm , I believe . I want to leave my little child here in safe keeping for a night . She is such a baby,--I can not carry her any further through this storm . ' And he put aside the wrappings of the bundle he carried and showed me a small pale infant asleep . ' She 's motherless , ' he added , ' and I 'm taking her to my relatives . But I have to ride some distance from here on very urgent business , and if you will look after her for to - night I 'll call for her to - morrow . Poor little innocent ! She 's hungry and fretful . I have n't anything to give her and the storm looks like continuing . Will you let her stay with you ? ' ' Certainly ! ' said I , without thinking a bit further about it . ' Leave her here by all means . We 'll see she gets all she wants . ' He gave me the child at once and said in a very soft voice : ' You are most generous!--"verily
16783	17238	17239	17239	Jocelyn	120	" You 're sure you do n't mind ? ' ' Not at all ! ' I answered him,--'You'll come back for her to - morrow , of course . ' He smiled and said--'Oh yes , of course ! To - morrow ! I 'm really very much obliged to you ! ' Then he seemed to think for a moment and put his hand in his pocket , but I stopped him--'No , sir , ' I said , ' excuse me , but I do n't want any pay for giving a babe a night 's shelter . ' He looked at me very straight with his big clear hazel eyes , and then shook hands with me . ' You 're an honest fellow , ' he said,--and he stooped and kissed the child he had put into my arms . ' I 'm extremely sorry to trouble you , but the storm is too much for this helpless little creature . ' ' You yourself are wet through , ' I interrupted . ' That does n't matter , ' he answered,--'for me nothing matters . Thank you a thousand times ! Good - night ! ' The rain was coming down faster than ever and I stepped back into the shed , covering the child up so that the drifting wet should not beat upon it . He came after me and kissed it again , saying ' Good - night , poor little innocent , good - night ! ' three or four times . Then he went off quickly and sprang into his saddle and in the blur of rain I saw horse and man turn away . He waved his hand once and his handsome pale face gleamed upon me like that of a ghost in the storm . ' Till to - morrow ! ' he called , and was gone . I took the child into the house and called Priscilla . She was always a rough one as you know , even in her younger days , and she at once laid her tongue to with a will and as far as she dared called me a fool for my pains . And so I was , for when I came to think of it the man was a stranger to me , and I had never asked him his name . It was just his handsome face and the way he had with him that had thrown me off my guard as it were ; so I stood and looked silly enough , I suppose , while Priscilla fussed about with the baby , for it had wakened and was crying . Well!"--and
17243	17294	17239	17239	Jocelyn	120	sigh--"That 's about all ! We never saw the man again , and the child was never claimed ; but every six months I received a couple of bank - notes in an envelope bearing a different postmark each time , with the words : ' For Innocent ' written inside-- "
17312	17324	17325	17325	he	630	" Every six months for a steady twelve years on end , "
17327	17379	17380	17380	He	630	on,--"then the money suddenly stopped . Now you understand , do n't you ? YOU were the babe that was left with me that stormy night ; and you 've been with me ever since . But you 're not MY child . I do n't know whose child you are ! "
17438	17450	17451	17451	she	120	" You -- you do n't know whose child I am ! "
17452	17512	17559	17559	she	632	repeated,--"I am not yours -- and you do n't know -- you do n't know who I belong to ! Oh , it hurts me!--it hurts me , Dad ! I ca n't realise it ! I thought you were my own dear father!--and I loved you!--oh , how much I loved you!--yet you have deceived me all along ! "
17513	17520	17521	17521	he	631	" I have n't deceived you , "
17526	17544	17521	17521	he	631	" I 've done all for the best -- I meant to tell you when you married Robin-- "
17554	17558	17559	17559	she	632	" Marry Robin ! "
17560	17581	17604	17604	she	632	exclaimed--"How could I marry Robin ? I 'm nothing ! I 'm nobody ! I have not even a name ! "
17597	17603	17604	17604	she	632	" Not even a name ! "
17605	17610	17582	17582	She	632	murmured--"Not even a name ! "
17632	17640	17641	17641	she	632	" Oh , help me , Dad ! "
17644	17792	17641	17641	she	632	piteously--"Comfort me ! Say something -- anything ! I feel so lost -- so astray ! All my life seems gone!--I ca n't realise it ! Yes , I know ! You have been very kind,--all kindness , just as if I had been your own little girl . Oh , why did you tell me I was your own?--I was so proud to be your daughter -- and now -- it 's so hard -- so hard ! Only a few moments ago I was a happy girl with a loving father as I thought -- now I know I 'm only a poor nameless creature,--deserted by my parents and left on your hands . Oh , Dad dear ! I 've given you years of trouble!--I hope I 've been good to you ! It 's not my fault that I am what I am ! "
17803	17883	17795	17795	his	635	" Dear child , of course it 's not your fault ! That 's what I 've said all along . You 're innocent , like your name,--and you 've been a blessing to me all your days,--the farm has been brighter for your living on it,--so you 've no cause to worry me or yourself about what 's past long ago and ca n't be helped . No one knows your story but Priscilla,--no one need ever know . "
17892	17895	17896	17896	she	637	" Priscilla ! "
17897	17907	17795	17795	his	635	echoed--"She knew , and she never said a word ! "
17908	17920	17922	17922	Jocelyn	120	" If she had , she 'd have got the sack , "
17926	17936	17922	17922	Jocelyn	120	" You were brought up always as MY child . "
17950	17959	17960	17960	she	120	" I want to know how that was , "
17965	17977	17960	17960	she	120	" You told me my mother died when I was born . "
17983	17995	17996	17996	he	638	" Well , that was true , or so I suppose , "
17999	18018	17996	17996	he	638	" The man who brought you said you were motherless . But I -- I have never married . "
18019	18038	18039	18039	He	638	" Then how could you tell Robin -- and everyone else about here that I was your daughter ? "
18044	18055	18056	18056	he	638	" Child , do n't stare at me like that ! "
18067	18086	18056	18056	he	638	" It does n't matter what I said -- I had to let the neighbours think you were mine-- "
18103	18110	18095	18095	she	640	" Dad ! Oh , Dad ! "
18125	18129	18130	18130	he	638	" What now ? "
18134	18144	18130	18130	he	638	fiercely--"What trouble are you going to make of it ? "
18145	18154	18155	18155	she	640	" Oh , if it were only trouble , "
18160	18218	18155	18155	she	640	" It 's far worse ! You 've branded me with shame ! Oh , I understand now ! I understand at last why the girls about here never make friends with me ! I understand why Robin seems to pity me so much ! Oh , how shall I ever look people in the face again ! "
18228	18232	18233	18233	he	638	" Little fool ! "
18236	18372	18233	18233	he	638	roughly,--"What shame are you talking of ? I see no shame in laying claim to a child of my own , even though the claim has no reality . Look at the thing squarely ! Here comes a strange man with a baby and leaves it on my hands . You know what a scandalous , gossiping little place this is,--and it was better to say at once the baby was mine than leave it to the neighbours to say the same thing and that I would n't acknowledge it . Not a soul about here would have believed the true story if I had told it to them . I 've done everything for the best -- I know I have . And there 'll never be a word said if you marry Robin . "
18411	18418	18419	18419	she	641	" I shall never marry Robin ! "
18424	18479	18419	18419	she	641	firmness--"And I will not be considered your illegitimate child any longer . It 's cruel of you to have made me live on a lie!--yes , cruel!--though you 've been so kind in other things . You do n't know who my parents were -- you've no right to think they were not honest ! "
18533	18539	18540	18540	she	643	" What right have you ? "
18544	18613	18540	18540	she	643	" The man who brought me to you,--poor wretched me!--if he was my father , may have been good and true . He said I was motherless ; and he , or someone else , sent you money for me till I was twelve . That did not look as if I was forgotten . Now you say the money has stopped -- well!--my father may be dead . "
18626	18653	18614	18614	Her	643	" But there is nothing in all this that should make you think me basely born,--nothing that should have persuaded you to put shame upon me ! "
18673	18788	18668	18668	he	645	" It 's the old story , I see ! Do a good action and it turns out a curse ! Basely born ! Of course you are basely born , if that 's the way you put it ! What man alive would leave his own lawful child at a strange farm off the high - road and never claim it again ? You 're a fool , I tell you ! This man who brought you to me was by his look and bearing some fine gentleman or other who had just the one idea in his head -- to get rid of an encumbrance . And so he got rid of you-- "
18789	18799	18800	18800	she	646	" Do n't go over the whole thing again ! "
18805	18847	18848	18848	She	646	patience-"-I was an encumbrance to him -- I've been an encumbrance to you . I 'm sorry ! But in no case had you the right to set a stigma on me which perhaps does not exist . That was wrong ! "
18858	18905	18848	18848	She	646	" I 've been a burden on you for six years now,--it 's six years , you say , since the money stopped . I wish I could do something in return for what I 've cost you all those six years,--I've tried to be useful . "
18917	18920	18921	18921	he	647	" Innocent ! "
18944	18990	18930	18930	She	646	" No ! I ca n't do that ! Not just yet ! You see , it 's all so unexpected -- things have changed altogether in a moment . I ca n't feel quite the same -- my heart seems so sore and cold . "
18999	19010	19011	19011	he	647	" Ah , well , it is as I thought ! "
19016	19078	19011	19011	he	647	" You 're more concerned about yourself than about me . A few minutes ago you only cared to know what the doctors thought of my illness , but now it 's nothing to you that I shall be dead in a year . Your mind is set on your own trouble , or what you choose to consider a trouble . "
19113	19118	19119	19119	she	646	" I am sorry ! "
19124	19192	19119	19119	she	646	" But this is the first time I have known real trouble -- you forget that!--and you must forgive me if I am stupid about it . And if the doctors really believe you are to die in a year I wish I could take your place , Dad!--I would rather be dead than live shamed . And there 's nothing left for me now,--not even a name-- "
19201	19208	19194	19194	she	646	" Why am I called Innocent ? "
19209	19234	19235	19235	he	647	" Why ? Because that 's the name that was written on every slip of paper that came with each six months ' money , "
19240	19249	19194	19194	she	646	" That 's the only reason I know . "
19250	19258	19259	19259	she	646	" Was I baptised by that name ? "
19266	19272	19194	19194	she	646	" You were never baptised . "
19273	19277	19278	19278	She	646	" Never baptised ! "
19292	19303	19304	19304	she	646	" Could you not have done that much for me ? "
19310	19316	19278	19278	She	646	last--"Would it have been impossible ? "
19375	19565	19363	19363	He	647	" Not impossible -- no,--maybe I could have baptised you myself if I had thought about it . ' Tis but a sprinkle of water and ' In the Name of the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost . ' But somehow I never worried my head -- for as long as you were a baby I looked for the man who brought you day after day , and in my own mind left all that sort of business for him to attend to -- and when he did n't come and you grew older , it fairly slipped my remembrance altogether . I 'm not fond of the Church or its ways,--and you 've done as well without baptism as with it , surely . Innocent is a good name for you , and fits your case . For you 're innocent of the faults of your parents whatever they were , and you 're innocent of my blunders . You 're free to make your own life pleasant if you 'll only put a bright face on it and make the best of an awkward business . "
19581	19591	19592	19592	he	650	" As for the tale I told the neighbours , "
19594	19791	19566	19566	She	649	on--"it was the best thing I could think of . If I had said you were a child I had taken in to adopt , not one of them would have believed me ; ' twas a case of telling one lie or t'other , the real truth being so queer and out of the common , so I chose the easiest . And it 's been all right with you , my girl , whichever way you put it . There may be a few stuck - up young huzzies in the village that are n't friendly to you , but you may take it that it 's more out of jealousy of Robin 's liking for you than anything else . Robin loves you -- you know he does ; and all you 've got to do is to make him happy . Marry him , for the farm will be his when I 'm dead , and it 'll give me a bit of comfort to feel that you 're settled down with him in the old home . For then I know it 'll go on just the same -- just the same-- "
19889	19893	19899	19899	she	653	" good - night "
19906	19924	19899	19899	she	653	" The men are away now . Is there anything you want before I go to bed ? "
19946	19955	19956	19956	he	652	" No , there 's nothing I want ! "
19961	20189	19956	19956	he	652	tones--"Nothing but peace and quietness ! I 've told you your story , and you take it ill . But recollect , girl , that if you consider any shame has been put on you , I 've put equal shame on myself for your sake -- I , Hugo Jocelyn,--against whom never a word has been said but this,--which is a lie -- that my child , mine!--was born out of wedlock ! I suffered this against myself solely for your sake -- I , who never wronged a woman in my life!--I , who never loved but one woman , who died before I had the chance to marry her!--and I say and I swear I have sacrificed something of my name and reputation to you ! So that you need not make trouble because you also share in the sacrifice . Robin thinks you 're my child , and therefore his cousin,--and he counts nothing against you , for he knows that what the world would count against you must be my fault and would be my fault , if the lie I started against myself was true . Marry Robin , I tell you!--and if you care to make me happy , marry him before I die . Then you 're safe out of all harm 's way . If you DON'T marry him-- "
20226	20232	20233	20233	she	655	" Yes ? What then ? "
20238	20246	20247	20247	he	656	" Then you must take the consequences , "
20250	20272	20247	20247	he	656	" The farm and all I have is left to Robin,--he 's my dead sister 's son and my nearest living kin-- "
20273	20278	20279	20279	she	655	" I know that , "
20284	20325	20279	20279	she	655	" and I 'm glad he has everything . It 's right that it should be so . I shall not be in his way . You may be quite sure of that . But I shall not marry him . "
20326	20333	20334	20334	he	656	" You 'll not marry him ? "
20357	20497	20498	20498	She	657	" Dad , do n't be angry!--it only hurts you and it does no good ! Just before supper you reminded me of what they say in Church that ' the sins of the fathers should be visited on the children , even unto the third and fourth generation . ' I will not visit the sin of my father and mother on anyone . If you will give me a little time I shall be able to understand everything more clearly , and perhaps bear it better . I want to be quite by myself . I must try to see myself as I am,--unbaptised , nameless , forsaken ! And if there is anything to be done with this wretched little self of mine , it is I that must do it . With God 's help ! "
20512	20518	20502	20502	her	657	" With God 's help ! "
20552	20562	20563	20563	she	657	" Shall I get you some wine , Dad ? "
20571	20574	20575	20575	he	658	" No ! "
20578	20583	20563	20563	she	657	curtly--"Priscilla can get it . "
20584	20590	20594	20594	he	658	" Then good - night ! "
20603	20608	20609	20609	he	658	" Are you going ? "
20612	20870	20871	20871	his	659	" Without your usual kiss?--your usual tenderness ? Why should you change to me ? Your own father -- if he was your father -- deserted you,--and I have been , a father to you in his place , wronging my own honourable name for your sake ; am I to blame for this ? Be reasonable ! The laws of man are one thing and the laws of God are another,--and we have to make the best we can of ourselves between the two . There 's many a piece of wicked injustice in the world , but nothing more wicked than to set shame or blame on a child that 's born without permit of law or blessing of priest . For it 's not the child 's fault,--it 's brought into the world without its own consent,--and yet the world fastens a slur upon it ! That 's downright brutal and senseless!--for if there is any blame attached to the matter it should be fastened on the parents , and not on the child . And that 's what I thought when you were left on my hands -- I took the blame of you on myself , and I was careful that you should be treated with every kindness and respect -- mind you that ! Respect ! There 's not a man on the place that does n't doff his cap to you ; and you 've been as my own daughter always . You ca n't deny it ! And more than that"--here

20973	21015	20968	20968	he	659	" Thou must look at it in this way , dear child ! That if God deprived thee of one father he gave thee another in his place ! Make the best of that gift before it be taken from thee ! "

28630	28638	28639	28639	she	902	" Do you -- can you care?--NOW ? "
28642	28740	28624	28624	She	902	" Of course ! What is there in all this story that can change my love for you ? That you are not my cousin?--that my uncle is not your own father ? What does that matter to me ? You are someone else 's child , and if we never know who that someone is , why should we vex ourselves about it ? You are you!--you are Innocent!--the sweetest , dearest little girl that ever lived , and I adore you ! What difference does it make that you are not Uncle Hugo 's daughter ? "
28741	28750	28751	28751	she	904	" It makes a great difference to me , "
28754	28767	28751	28751	she	904	sadly--"I do not belong any more to the Sieur Amadis de Jocelin ! "
28776	28781	28782	28782	he	905	" Why , Innocent ! "
28783	28821	28624	28624	She	902	exclaimed--"Surely you 're not worrying your mind over that old knight , dead and gone more than three hundred years ago ! Dear little goose ! How on earth does he come into this trouble of yours ? "
28822	28828	28829	28829	she	904	" He comes in everywhere ! "
28842	29004	28829	28829	she	904	" You do n't know , Robin!--you would never understand ! But I have loved the Sieur Amadis ever since I can remember;--I have talked to him and studied with him!--I have read his old books , and all the poems he wrote -- and he seemed to be my friend ! I thought I was born of his kindred -- and I was proud of it -- and I felt it would be my duty to live at Briar Farm always because he would wish his line quite unbroken -- and I think -- perhaps -- yes , I think I might have married you and been a good wife to you just for his sake!--and now it is all spoiled!--because though you will be the master of Briar Farm , you will not be the lineal descendant of the Sieur Amadis ! No,--it is finished!--all finished with your Uncle Hugo!--and the doctors say he can only live a year ! "
29093	29098	29100	29100	he	84	" love - child , "
29203	29207	29208	29208	he	84	" Dear Innocent , "
29212	29311	29208	29208	he	84	last--"Don't cry ! It cuts me to the heart ! I would give my very life to save you from a sorrow -- you know I would ! If you ever thought , as you say , that you could or would marry me for the sake of the Sieur Amadis , you might just as well marry me now , even though the Sieur Amadis is out of it . I would make you so happy ! I would indeed ! And no one need ever know that you are not really the lineal descendant of the Knight-- "
29316	29320	29321	29321	she	910	" Priscilla knows , "
29322	29382	29312	29312	She	910	said--"and , no matter how you look at it , I am ' base - born . ' Your Uncle Hugo has let all the village folk think I am his illegitimate child -- and that is ' base - born ' of itself . Oh , it is cruel ! Even you thought so , did n't you ? "
29386	29394	29395	29395	he	911	" I did not know , dear , "
29398	29400	29395	29395	he	911	gently--"I fancied-- "
29401	29409	29410	29410	she	910	" Do not deny it , Robin ! "
29415	29545	29410	29410	she	910	" You did think so ! Well , it 's true enough , I suppose!--I am ' base - born'--but your uncle is not my father . He is a good , upright man -- you can always be proud of him ! He has not sinned,--though he has burdened me with the shame of sin ! I think that is unfair,--but I must bear it somehow , and I will try to be brave . I 'm glad I 've told you all about it,--and you are very kind to have taken it so well -- and to care for me still -- but I shall never marry you , Robin!--never ! I shall never bring my ' base - born ' blood into the family of Jocelyn ! "
29564	29567	29568	29568	he	912	" Innocent ! "
29569	29649	29552	29552	her	913	murmured--"Don't be hard upon me ! Think a little longer before you leave me without any hope ! It means so much to my life ! Surely you can not be cruel ? Do you care for me less than you care for that old knight buried under his own effigy in the garden ? Will you not think kindly of a living man?--a man who loves you beyond all things ? Oh , Innocent!--be gentle , be merciful ! "
29662	29675	29676	29676	she	913	" It is just because I am kind and gentle and merciful , "
29686	29819	29676	29676	she	913	" that I will not marry you , dear ! I know I am right,--and you will think so too , in time . For the moment you imagine me to be much better and prettier than I am -- and that there is no one like me!--poor Robin!--you are blind!--there are so many sweet and lovely girls , well born , with fathers and mothers to care for them -- and you , with your good looks and kind ways , could marry any one of them -- and you will , some day ! Good - night , dear ! You have stayed here a long time talking to me!--just suppose you were seen sitting on this window - ledge so late!--it is past midnight!--what would be said of me ! "
29820	29826	29828	29828	Robin	84	" What could be said ? "
29832	29846	29828	29828	Robin	84	" I came up here of my own accord,--the blame would be mine ! "
29857	29876	29676	29676	she	913	" Ah , Robin ! The man is never blamed ! It 's always the woman 's fault ! "
29877	29886	29887	29887	he	84	" Where 's your fault to - night ? "
29890	29896	29897	29897	she	914	" Oh , most plain ! "
29900	29966	29897	29897	she	914	" When I saw you coming , I ought to have shut the window , drawn the curtains , and left you to clamber down the wall again as fast as you clambered up ! But I wanted to tell you what had happened -- and how everything had changed for me -- and now -- now that you know all -- good - night ! "
30008	30013	30014	30014	he	84	" Good - night ! "
30019	30036	30014	30014	he	84	" Good - night , my angel Innocent ! Good - night , my little love ! "
30268	30271	30272	30272	he	112	" Landon ! "
30273	30284	30316	30317	his antagonist	921	gasped--"What 's the matter with you ? Are you mad ? "
30285	30288	30290	30290	Landon	112	" Yes ! "
30292	30308	30290	30290	Landon	112	hoarsely--"And enough to make me so ! You devil ! You 've ruined the girl ! "
30326	30330	30331	30331	he	112	" You lie ! "
30332	30368	30369	30369	Landon	112	said--"And you shall pay for it ! Come away from the house and fight like a man ! Come into the grass meadow yonder , where no one can see or hear us . Come ! "
30388	30394	30395	30395	he	112	" That 's a trick ! "
30398	30402	30395	30395	he	112	scornfully--"You'll run away ! "
30403	30406	30408	30408	Clifford	84	" Come ! "
30410	30422	30408	30408	Clifford	84	vehemently--"You're more likely to run away than I am ! Come ! "
30450	30457	30458	30458	he	112	" No , I wo n't ! "
30461	30492	30458	30458	he	112	curtly--"I've done all I want to do for to - night . I 've shaken you like the puppy you are ! To - morrow we 'll settle our differences . "
30604	30609	30599	30599	he	84	" Let me go ! "
30611	30615	30599	30599	he	84	Landon--"You're killing me ! "
30616	30621	30599	30599	he	84	" Serve you right ! "
30623	30633	30599	30599	he	84	Clifford--"You scoundrel ! My uncle shall know of this ! "
30634	30641	30643	30643	Landon	112	" Tell him what you like ! "
30645	30657	30643	30643	Landon	112	faintly--"I do n't care ! Get off my chest!--you're suffocating me ! "
30669	30674	30675	30675	he	84	" Will you apologise ? "
30678	30682	30742	30742	Clifford	84	" Apologise?--for what ? "
30683	30693	30599	30599	he	84	" For your insolence to me and my cousin . "
30694	30699	30742	30742	Clifford	84	" Cousin be hanged ! "
30701	30734	30599	30599	he	84	Landon--"She 's no more your cousin than I am -- she 's only a nameless bastard ! I heard her tell you so ! And fine airs she gives herself on nothing ! "
30735	30740	30742	30742	Clifford	84	" You miserable spy ! "
30750	30763	30742	30742	Clifford	84	vise--"Whatever you heard is none of your business ! Will you apologise ? "
30764	30779	30780	30780	Landon	112	" Oh , I 'll apologise , if you like!--anything to get your weight off me!"--and
30788	30799	30780	30780	Landon	112	" But I keep my own opinion all the same ! "
30850	30859	30860	30860	he	84	" Yes -- I keep my own opinion ! "
30865	30961	30966	30966	he	84	" You 've got the better of me just now -- but you wo n't always , my pert Cock Robin ! You wo n't always . Do n't you think it ! Briar Farm and I may part company -- but there 's a bigger place than Briar Farm -- there 's the world!--that 's a wide field and plenty of crops growing on it ! And the men that sow those kind of crops and reap them and bring them in , are better farmers than you 'll ever be ! As for your girl!"--here
30982	31015	30966	30966	he	84	quarrel--"You can keep her ! A nice ' Innocent ' SHE is!--talking with a man in her bedroom after midnight!--why , I would n't have her as a gift -- not now ! "
31030	31034	31035	31035	he	112	" Hands off ! "
31036	31092	31096	31096	he	112	said--"Don't touch me ! I 'm in a killing mood ! I 've a knife on me -- you have n't . You 're the master -- I'm the man -- and I 'll play fair ! I 've my future to think of , and I do n't want to start with a murder ! "
31171	31187	31188	31188	he	84	" The simplest way out of it is to make a clean breast of everything , "
31194	31213	31188	31188	he	84	" Tomorrow I 'll see Uncle Hugo early in the morning and tell him just what has happened . "
31306	31311	31348	31348	Priscilla	121	motto,--"Mon coeur me soutien ! "
31552	31557	31549	31549	she	152	" They are talking about me!"--then
31599	31618	31564	31564	she	152	" Priscilla dear , why did you never tell me that I was n't Dad 's own daughter ? "
31640	31686	31638	31638	she	121	" Lord , lovey ! How you frightened me ! Why did n't I tell you ? Well , in the first place , ' twasn't none of my business , and in the second , ' twouldn't have done any good if I had . "
31699	31710	31713	31713	Priscilla	121	" And who is it that 's told you now ? "
31715	31720	31713	31713	Priscilla	121	nervously--"some meddlin ' old fool-- "
31728	31737	31721	31721	Innocent	152	" Hush , Priscilla ! Dad himself told me-- "
31738	31755	31757	31757	Priscilla	121	" Well , he might just as well have kept a still tongue in his head , "
31761	31839	31757	31757	Priscilla	121	" He 's kept it for eighteen years , an ' why he should let it go wagging loose now , the Lord only knows ! There 's no making out the ways of men,--they first plays the wise and silent game like barn - door owls,--then all on a suddint - like they starts cawing gossip for all they 're worth , like crows . And what 's the good of tellin ' ye , anyway ? "
31840	31846	31848	31848	Innocent	152	" No good , perhaps , "
31850	31893	31848	31848	Innocent	152	sorrowfully--"but it 's right I should know . You see , I 'm not a child any more -- I'm eighteen -- that 's a woman -- and a woman ought to know what she must expect more or less in her life-- "
31913	31929	31930	31930	she	152	" What a woman must expect in life is good ' ard knocks and blows , "
31931	32004	31894	31894	Priscilla	121	said--"unless she can get a man to look arter her what 's not of the general kicking spirit . Take my advice , dearie ! You marry Mr. Robin!--as good a boy as ever breathed -- he'll be a kind fond ' usband to ye , and arter all that 's what a woman thrives best on -- kindness -- an ' you 've ' ad it all your life up to now-- "
32005	32008	32010	32010	Innocent	152	" Priscilla , "
32012	32064	32010	32010	Innocent	152	decidedly--"I can not marry Robin ! You know I can not ! A poor nameless girl like me!--why , it would be a shame to him in after - years . Besides , I do n't love him -- and it 's wicked to marry a man you do n't love . "
32076	32086	32087	32087	she	121	" You talks a lot about love , child , "
32088	32185	31894	31894	Priscilla	121	said--"but I 'm thinkin ' you do n't know much about it . Them old books an ' papers you found up in the secret room are full of nonsense , I 'm pretty sure -- an ' if you believes that men are always sighin ' an ' dyin ' for a woman , you 're mistaken -- yes , you are , lovey ! They goes where they can be made most comfortable -- an ' it do n't matter what sort o ' woman gives the comfort so long as they gits it . "
32191	32202	32203	32203	she	121	" You do n't know anything about it , Priscilla , "
32204	32209	32087	32087	she	121	answered--"You were never married . "
32210	32220	32222	32222	Priscilla	121	" Thank the Lord and His goodness , no ! "
32227	32338	32222	32222	Priscilla	121	sniff--"I've never been troubled with the whimsies of a man , which is worse than all the megrims of a woman any day . I 've looked arter Mr. Jocelyn in a way -- but he 's no sort of a man to worry about -- he just goes reglar to the farmin'--an ' that 's all -- a decent creature always , an ' steady as his own oxen what pulls the plough . An ' when he 's gone , if go he must , I 'll look arter you an ' Mr. Robin , an ' please God , I 'll dance your babies on my old knees-- "
32356	32365	32366	32366	she	942	" Why , Priscilla , you 're crying ! "
32367	32376	32222	32222	Priscilla	121	exclaimed--"Don't do that ! Why should you cry ? "
32377	32381	32366	32366	she	942	" Why indeed ! "
32383	32568	32569	32569	She	943	Priscilla--"Except that I 'm a doiterin ' fool ! I ca n't abear the thoughts of you turnin ' yer back on the good that God gives ye , an ' floutin ' Mr. Robin , who 's the best sort o ' man that ever could fall to the lot of a little tender maid like you -- why , lovey , you do n't know the wickedness o ' this world , nor the ways of it -- an ' you talks about love as if it was somethin' wonderful an ' far away , when here it is at yer very feet for the pickin ' up ! What 's the good of all they books ye've bin readin ' if they do n't teach ye that the old knight you 're fond of got so weary of the world that arter tryin ' everythin ' in turn he found nothin' better than to marry a plain , straight country wench and settle down in Briar Farm for all his days ? Ai n't that the lesson he 's taught ye ? "
32604	32607	32608	32608	she	943	" No , "
32609	32668	32569	32569	She	943	said--"He has not taught me that at all . He came here to ' seek forgetfulness'--so it is said in the words he carved on the panel in his study,--but we do not know that he ever really forgot . He only ' found peace , ' and peace is not happiness -- except for the very old . "
32669	32675	32679	32679	Priscilla	121	" Peace is not happiness ! "
32681	32698	32679	32679	Priscilla	121	staring--"That 's a queer thing to say , lovey ! What do you call being happy ? "
32699	32704	32711	32712	the girl	414	" It is difficult to explain"--and
32721	32732	32733	32733	She	121	feeling--"Your idea of happiness and mine must be so different ! "
32734	32750	32711	32712	the girl	414	smiled--"Dear , good Priscilla ! You are so much more easily contented than I am ! "
32766	32772	32773	32773	she	943	" See here , lovey ! "
32774	32899	32751	32751	Priscilla	121	said--"You're just like a young bird on the edge of a nest ready to fly . You do n't know the world nor the ways of it . Oh , my dear , it ai n't all gold harvests and apples ripening rosy in the sun ! You 've lived all your life in the open country , and so you 've always had the good God near you,--but there 's places where the houses stand so close together that the sky can hardly make a patch of blue between the smoking chimneys -- like London , for instance -- ah!--that 's where you 'd find what the world 's like , lovey!--where you feels so lonesome that you wonders why you ever were born-- "
32900	32906	32908	32909	the girl	414	" I wonder that already , "
32913	32965	32908	32909	the girl	414	" Do n't worry me , dear ! I have so much to think about -- my life seems so altered and strange -- I hardly understand myself -- and I do n't know what I shall do with my future -- but I cannot -- I will not marry Robin ! "
33054	33058	33059	33059	she	414	" Dear home ! "
33060	33083	33094	33094	she	414	murmured--"Home that is not mine -- that never will be mine ! How I have loved you!--how I shall always love you ! "
33110	33111	33109	33109	her	414	" Dad"--the
33162	33166	33167	33167	she	414	" Dear Dad ! "
33181	33192	33171	33171	she	414	cheek--"How are you this morning ? Did you sleep well ? "
33218	33226	33227	33227	he	949	" I did not sleep at all , "
33229	33276	33301	33301	he	949	her--"I lay broad awake , thinking of you . Thinking of you , my little innocent , fatherless , motherless lamb ! And you , child!--you did not sleep so well as you should have done , talking with Robin half the night out of window ! "
33293	33300	33301	33301	he	949	" No harm , no harm ! "
33302	33351	33352	33352	he	949	said--"Just two young doves cooing among the leaves at mating time ! Robin has told me all about it . Now listen , child!--I'm away to - day to the market town -- there 's seed to buy and crops to sell -- I'll take Ned Landon with me-- "
33365	33475	33364	33364	his	949	features--"Yes!--I'll take Ned Landon with me -- he 's shrewd enough when he 's sober -- and he 's cunning enough , too , for that matter!--yes , I 'll take him with me . We 'll be off in the dog - cart as soon as breakfast 's done . My time 's getting short , but I 'll attend to my own business as long as I can -- I'll look after Briar Farm till I die -- and I 'll die in harness . There 's plenty of work to do yet -- plenty of work ; and while I 'm away you can settle up things-- "
33508	33514	33515	33515	she	152	" Yes , dear Dad ! "
33518	33527	33515	33515	she	152	soothingly--"What is it you wish me to do ? "
33540	33545	33546	33546	he	950	" Settle up things , "
33553	33628	33546	33546	he	950	emphasis--"Settle up things with Robin . No more beating about the bush ! You talked to him long enough out of window last night , and mind you!--somebody was listening ! That means mischief ! _ I _ do n't blame you , poor wilding!--but remember , SOMEBODY WAS LISTENING ! Now think of that and of your good name , child!--settle with Robin and we 'll have the banns put up next Sunday . "
33767	33777	33778	33778	he	950	" Such little white hands , are n't they ? "
33792	33836	33788	33788	she	152	cup--"Eh , wilding ? The prettiest lily flowers I ever saw ! And one of them will look all the prettier for a gold wedding - ring upon it ! Ay , ay ! We 'll have the banns put up on Sunday . "
33897	33908	33909	33909	he	950	" You heard what I said , did n't you ? "
33910	33914	33889	33889	he	950	demanded--"And you understood ? "
33926	33938	33915	33915	She	152	" Yes , Dad . I heard . And I understood . "
34031	34038	34039	34039	he	143	" It 's a fine day , "
34040	34097	34098	34098	he	143	said--"and it 's a fine world ! Ay , that it is ! I 'm not sure there 's a better anywhere ! And it 's a bit difficult to think of going down for ever into the dark and the cold , away from the sunshine and the sky -- but it 's got to be done!"--here
34112	34143	34098	34098	he	143	blow--"It 's got to be done , and I 've got to do it ! But not yet -- not quite yet!--I've plenty of time and chance to stop mischief ! "
34183	34191	34192	34192	he	143	" We shall be away all day , "
34193	34202	34213	34213	his	143	said--"I and Ned Landon . Do you hear ? "
34227	34236	34237	34237	he	143	" Well , what are you wondering at ? "
34242	34253	34237	34237	he	143	testily--"You need not open your eyes at me like that ! "
34258	34267	34268	34268	she	955	" Did I open my eyes , Dad ? "
34269	34280	34213	34213	his	143	said--"I did not mean to be curious . I only thought-- "
34281	34287	34288	34288	he	143	" You only thought what ? "
34293	34298	34213	34213	his	143	heat--"What did you think ? "
34299	34318	34213	34213	his	143	" Oh , just about your being away all day in the town -- you will be so tired-- "
34319	34335	34336	34336	He	143	" Tired ? Not I!--not when there 's work to do and business to settle ! "
34348	34357	34358	34358	he	143	" Work to do and business to settle ! "
34359	34385	34386	34386	She	955	repeated--"Yes , little girl ! There 's not much time before me , and I must leave everything in good order for you and Robin . "
34402	34407	34408	34408	he	143	" You and Robin ! "
34413	34447	34448	34448	He	143	" Ay , ay ! Briar Farm will be in the best of care when I 'm dead , and it 'll thrive well with young love and hope to keep it going ! "
34464	34469	34470	34470	he	143	" There , there ! "
34476	34525	34448	34448	He	143	gently--"We'll think no more of trouble and folly and mistakes in life ; it 'll be all joy and peace for you , child ! Take God 's good blessing of an honest lad 's love and be happy with it ! And when I come home to - night,"--he
34533	34562	34470	34470	he	143	moment--"yes!--when I come home , let me hear that it 's all clear and straight between you -- and we 'll have the banns put up on Sunday ! "
34595	34607	34608	34608	he	143	" You 'll have all the day to yourself with Robin , "
34614	34633	34608	34608	he	143	her--"There'll be no spies about the place , and no one listening , as there was last night ! "
34650	34655	34656	34656	she	955	" Who was it ? "
34657	34671	34608	34608	he	143	asked--"I said nothing wrong -- and I do not care!--but who was it ? "
34685	34689	34690	34690	She	955	" Ned Landon . "
34695	34699	34656	34656	she	955	" Ned Landon ? "
34700	34779	34656	34656	she	955	" Ay ! Ned Landon . He has n't the sweetest of tempers and he is n't always sober . He 's a bit in the way sometimes,--ay , ay!--a bit in the way ! But he 's a good farm hand for all that,--and his word stands for something ! I 'd rather he had n't heard you and Robin talking last night -- but what 's done is done , and it 's a mischief easy mended-- "
34780	34789	34790	34791	the girl	414	" Why , what mischief can there be ? "
34799	34816	34794	34794	her	414	quickly--"And why should he have listened ? It 's a mean trick to spy upon others ! "
34821	34897	34899	34899	he	143	" Of course it 's a mean trick , child!--but there 's a good many men -- and women too -- who are just made up of mean tricks and nothing more . They spend their lives in spying upon their neighbours and interfering in everybody 's business . You 'd soon find that out , my girl , if you lived in the big world that lies outside Briar Farm ! Ay!--and that reminds me-- "
34958	34964	34965	34965	he	143	" Now I 'm ready ! "
34966	34982	34983	34983	He	143	said--"Ready for all I 've got to do ! Good - bye , my wilding ! "
35000	35042	34983	34983	He	143	" Bless thee ! No child of my own could be dearer than thou art ! All I want now is to leave thee in safe and gentle keeping when I die . Think of this and be good to Robin ! "
35316	35318	35341	35341	Landon	112	" Dad "
35359	35367	35368	35368	He	112	" Good - morning , Miss Jocelyn ! "
35383	35387	35378	35378	She	958	" Good - morning "
35435	35441	35442	35442	he	112	" Come on , Landon ! "
35445	35450	35442	35442	he	112	impatiently--"No time for farewells ! "
35481	35492	35493	35493	he	112	" Take care of the house while I 'm gone ! "
35496	35503	35493	35493	he	112	her;--"You'll find Robin in the orchard . "
35652	35656	35657	35657	she	152	" I wonder ! "
35785	35789	35735	35742	romancist,--a weaver of wonderful thoughts into musical language,--this	979	" chanson d'amour . "
35997	36000	36001	36001	she	152	" Perhaps , "
36003	36029	35985	35985	she	152	whispered--"perhaps there is something in it after all!--something just a little new and out of the ordinary -- but -- how shall I ever know ! "
36207	36215	36216	36216	she	152	" I can always be his friend , "
36219	36290	36216	36216	she	152	herself--"And if I once make him understand clearly how much better it is for us to be like brother and sister , he will see things in the right way . And when he marries I am sure to be fond of his wife and children -- and -- and -- it will be ever so much happier for us all ! I 'll go and talk to him now . "
36369	36375	36376	36376	she	152	" Are you very busy ? "
36384	36414	36415	36415	She	152	" Just now , yes ! In a moment , no ! We shall lose this big bough in the next high wind if I do n't take care . "
36458	36502	36415	36415	She	152	" Now I am at your service ! You look very serious!--grave as a little judge , and quite reproachful ! What have I done?--or what has anybody done that you should almost frown at me on this bright sun - shiny morning ? "
36514	36525	36526	36526	she	152	" I 'm sorry I have such a depressing aspect , "
36527	36542	36543	36543	He	84	said--"I do n't feel very happy , and I suppose my face shows it . "
36569	36629	36565	36565	he	84	" Come and stroll about a bit with me through the orchard,--it will cheer you to see the apples hanging in such rosy clusters among the grey - green leaves . Nothing prettier in all the world , I think!--and they are just ripening enough to be fragrant . Come , dear ! Let us talk our troubles out ! "
36712	36744	36745	36745	he	84	" You see , dear , I know quite well what is worrying you . I 'm worried myself -- and I 'd better tell you all about it . Last night-- "
36756	36760	36748	36748	She	152	" Last night?--Well ? "
36761	36998	37047	37047	he	999	" Well -- Ned Landon was in hiding in the bushes under your window -- and he must have been there all the time we were talking together . How or why he came there I can not imagine . But he heard a good deal -- and when you shut your window he was waiting for me . Directly I got down he pounced on me like a tramp - thief , and -- now there!--don't look so frightened!--he said something that I could n't stand , so we had a jolly good fight . He got the worst of it , I can tell you ! He 's stiff and unfit to work to - day -- that 's why Uncle Hugo has taken him to the town . I told the whole story to Uncle Hugo this morning -- and he says I did quite right . But it 's a bore to have to go on ' bossing ' Landon -- he bears me a grudge , of course -- and I foresee it will be difficult to manage him . He can hardly be dismissed -- the other hands would want to know why ; no man has ever been dismissed from Briar Farm without good and fully explained reasons . This time no reasons could be given , because your name might come in , and I wo n't have that-- "
36999	37010	37011	37011	she	998	" Oh , Robin , it 's all my fault ! "
37014	37034	37011	37011	she	998	" If you would only let me go away ! Help me -- do help me to go away ! "
37042	37046	37047	37047	he	999	" Go away ! "
37048	37085	37086	37086	he	999	echoed--"You ! Why , Innocent , how can you think of such a thing ! You are the very life and soul of the place -- how can you talk of going away ! No , no!--not unless"--here
37098	37126	37086	37086	he	999	eyes--"not unless you will let me take you away!--just for a little while!--as a bridegroom takes a bride -- on a honeymoon of love and sunshine and roses-- "
37137	37141	37142	37142	she	998	" Dear Robin , "
37146	37266	37142	37142	she	998	gently--"would you marry a girl who can not love you as a wife should love ? Wo n't you understand that if I could and did love you I should be happier than I am?--though now , even if I loved you with all my heart , I would not marry you . How could I ? I am nothing -- I have no name -- no family -- and can you think that I would bring shame upon you ? No , Robin!--never ! I know what your Uncle Hugo wishes -- and oh!--if I could only make him happy I would do it!--but I cannot -- it would be wrong of me -- and you would regret it-- "
37267	37274	37275	37275	he	1000	" I should never regret it , "
37281	37359	37275	37275	he	1000	" If you would be my wife , Innocent , I should be the proudest , gladdest man alive ! Ah , dear!--do put all your fancies aside and try to realise what good you would be doing to the old man if he felt quite certain that you would be the little mistress of the old farm he loves so much -- I will not speak of myself -- you do not care for me!--but for him-- "
37373	37379	37380	37380	she	1001	" Could we not pretend ? "
37383	37389	37275	37275	he	1000	" What do you mean ? "
37390	37415	37275	37275	he	1000	" Why , pretend that we 're engaged -- just to satisfy him . Could n't you make things easy for me that way ? "
37416	37423	37424	37424	he	1002	" I do n't quite understand , "
37430	37437	37275	37275	he	1000	air--"How would it make things easy ? "
37438	37446	37448	37448	she	1001	" Why , do n't you see ? "
37452	37484	37448	37448	she	1001	eagerness--"When he comes home to - night let him think it 's all right -- and then -- then I 'll run away by myself -- and it will be my fault-- "
37485	37492	37493	37493	he	1002	" Innocent ! What are you talking about?"--and
37498	37555	37493	37493	he	1002	" My dear girl , if you dislike me so much that you would rather run away than marry me , I wo n't say another word about it . I 'll manage to smooth things over with my uncle for the present -- just to prevent his fretting himself -- and you shall not be worried-- "
37556	37564	37565	37565	she	1003	" You must not be worried either , "
37568	37611	37565	37565	she	1003	" You will not understand , and you do not think!--but just suppose it possible that , after all , my own parents did remember me at last and came to look after me -- and that they were perhaps dreadful wicked people-- "
37615	37626	37627	37627	he	1004	" The man who brought you here was a gentleman , "
37628	37650	37690	37690	he	1004	said--"Uncle Hugo told me so this morning , and said he was the finest - looking man he had ever seen . "
37657	37672	37673	37673	she	152	" You think he was a ' gentleman ' to desert his own child ? "
37679	37689	37690	37690	he	1004	" Dear , you do n't know the world , "
37691	37721	37651	37651	Innocent	152	said--"There may have been all sorts of dangers and difficulties -- anyhow , _ I _ do n't bear him any grudge ! He gave you to Briar Farm ! "
37771	37774	37775	37775	she	152	" Come ! "
37832	37839	37840	37840	she	152	" You are cross with him ! "
37845	37859	37840	37840	she	152	" You must not be so . He is the founder of your family-- "
37860	37870	37871	37871	he	84	" And the finish of it , I suppose ! "
37876	37913	37871	37871	he	84	" He stands between us two , Innocent!--a cold stone creature with no heart -- and you prefer him to me ! Oh , the folly of it all ! How can you be so cruel ! "
37938	37947	37948	37948	he	84	" You do not know what love is ! "
37956	37971	37948	37948	he	84	own--"Innocent , you do not know ! If you did!--if I might teach you-- ! "
37982	37989	37990	37990	she	152	" Love does not want teaching , "
37991	38063	38064	38064	she	152	said--"it comes -- when it will , and where it will ! It has not come to me , and you can not force it , Robin ! If I were your wife -- your wife without any wife 's love for you -- I should grow to hate Briar Farm!--yes , I should!--I should pine and die in the very place where I have been so happy!--and I should feel that HE"--here
38070	38080	38081	38081	She	152	Amadis--"would almost rise from this tomb and curse me ! "
38117	38129	38130	38130	she	152	" You take me just for the ordinary sort of girl , "
38132	38199	38130	38130	she	152	on--"A girl to caress and fondle and marry and make the mother of your children,--now for that you might choose among the girls about here , any of whom would be glad to have you for a husband . But , Robin , do you think I am really fit for that sort of life always?--can't you believe in anything else but marriage for a woman ? "
38261	38277	38278	38278	he	1010	" Dear , I can not believe in anything else but love for a woman , "
38279	38296	38255	38255	He	1010	said--"She was created and intended for love , and without love she must surely be unhappy . "
38297	38301	38302	38302	she	152	" Love!--ah yes ! "
38305	38311	38302	38302	she	152	quickly--"But marriage is not love ! "
38316	38327	38328	38328	he	1010	" You must not speak in that way , Innocent , "
38331	38339	38328	38328	he	1010	seriously--"It is wrong -- people would misunderstand you-- "
38348	38356	38357	38357	she	152	" Yes!--I'm sure ' people ' would ! "
38358	38376	38340	38340	Her	152	answered--"But ' people ' do n't matter -- to ME . It is truth that matters,--truth,--and love ! "
38384	38394	38395	38395	he	1010	" Why should you think marriage is not love ? "
38396	38414	38340	38340	Her	152	asked--"It is the one thing all lovers wish for -- to be married and to live together always-- "
38415	38428	38429	38429	she	152	" Oh , they wish for it , yes , poor things ! "
38438	38453	38454	38454	She	152	brows--"And when their wishes are gratified , they often wish they had not wished ! "
38457	38475	38454	38454	She	152	" Robin , this talk of ours is making me feel quite merry ! I am amused ! "
38476	38481	38482	38482	he	1010	" I am not ! "
38485	38496	38482	38482	he	1010	irritably--"You are much too young a girl to think these things-- "
38502	38526	38527	38527	she	152	" I know ! And I ought to get married while young , before I learn too many of ' these things , ' "
38528	38555	38454	38454	She	152	said--"Isn't that so ? Do n't frown , Robin ! Look at the Sieur Amadis ! How peacefully he sleeps ! He knew all about love ! "
38556	38562	38527	38527	she	152	" Of course he did ! "
38564	38578	38454	38454	She	152	Robin--"He was a perfectly sensible man -- he married and had six children . "
38596	38609	38454	38454	She	152	" Yes ! But he said good - bye to love first ! "
38618	38629	38630	38630	he	1010	" How can you tell?--what do you know about it ? "
38735	38743	38744	38744	she	152	" Come and sit beside me here , "
38745	38791	38706	38706	she	152	said--"We have the day to ourselves -- Dad said so,--and we can talk as long as we like . You ask me what I know?--not much indeed ! But I 'll tell you what the Sieur Amadis has told me!--if you care to hear it ! "
38792	38801	38802	38802	he	1010	" I 'm not sure that I do , "
38810	38858	38860	38860	she	152	" Oh , Robin!--how ungrateful you are ! You ought to be so pleased ! If you really loved me as much as you say , the mere sound of my voice ought to fill you with ecstasy ! Yes , really ! Come , be good ! "
38893	38899	38900	38900	she	152	" There!--you may hold it ! "
38907	38938	38880	38880	she	152	it--"Yes , you may ! Now , if the Sieur Amadis had been allowed to hold the hand of the lady he loved he would have gone mad with joy ! "
38939	38950	38952	38952	Robin	84	" Much good he 'd have done by going mad ! "
38960	38967	38952	38952	Robin	84	humour--"I'd rather be sane,--sane and normal . "
38976	38993	38968	38968	She	152	" Would you ? Poor Robin ! Well , you will be -- when you settle down-- "
38994	38998	38999	38999	he	1010	" Settle down ? "
39000	39007	38968	38968	She	152	echoed--"How ? What do you mean ? "
39008	39027	39028	39028	she	152	" Why , when you settle down with a wife , and -- shall we say six children ? "
39031	39065	39028	39028	she	152	merrily--"Yes , I think it must be six ! Like the Sieur Amadis ! And when you forget that you ever sat with me under the trees , holding my hand -- so ! "
39090	39093	39094	39094	he	1010	" Innocent ! "
39097	39104	39094	39094	he	1010	passionately--"if you would only listen to reason-- "
39110	39115	39116	39116	she	152	" I never could ! "
39128	39219	39107	39107	her	152	depreciation--"People who ask you to listen to reason are always so desperately dull ! Even Priscilla!--when she asks you to ' listen to reason , ' she 's in the worst of tempers ! Besides , Robin , dear , we shall have plenty of chances to ' listen to reason ' when we grow older,--we're both young just now , and a little folly wo n't hurt us . Have patience with me!--I want to tell you some quite unreasonable -- quite abnormal things about love ! May I ? "
39220	39230	39231	39231	he	1010	" Yes -- if _ I _ may too ! "
39253	39257	39258	39258	she	152	" Poor Robin ! "
39259	39339	39249	39249	her	152	said--"You deserve to be happy and you will be!--not with me , but with some one much better , and ever so much prettier ! I can see you as the master of Briar Farm -- such a sweet home for you and your wife , and all your little children running about in the fields among the buttercups and daisies -- a pretty sight , Robin!--I shall think of it often when -- when I am far away ! "
39353	39356	39357	39357	she	152	" Hush ! "
39370	39377	39378	39378	she	152	" When I think about love , "
39386	39606	39378	39378	she	152	voice--"I'm quite sure that very few people ever really feel it or understand it . It must be the rarest thing in all the world ! This poor Sieur Amadis , asleep so long in his grave , was a true lover,--and I will tell you how I know he had said good - bye to love when he married . All those books we found in the old dower - chest , that day when we were playing about together as children , belonged to him -- some are his own compositions , written by his own hand,--the others , as you know , are printed books which must have been difficult to get in his day , and are now , I suppose , quite out of date and almost unknown . I have read them all!--my head is a little library full of odd volumes ! But there is one -- a manuscript book -- which I never tire of reading,--it is a sort of journal in which the Sieur Amadis wrote down many of his own feelings -- sometimes in prose , sometimes in verse -- and by following them carefully and piecing them together , it is quite easy to find out his sadness and secret -- how he loved once and never loved again-- "
39607	39614	39633	39633	She	1013	" You ca n't tell that , "
39616	39632	39378	39378	she	152	Robin--"men often say they can only love once -- but they love ever so many times-- "
39649	39653	39654	39654	she	1013	" Do they ? "
39657	39679	39654	39654	she	1013	softly--"I am so glad , Robin ! For you will find it easy then to love somebody else instead of me ! "
39685	39691	39692	39692	he	1014	" I did n't mean that-- "
39695	39895	39929	39929	She	1016	" No ? I think you did!--but of course if you had thought twice you would n't have said it ! It was uttered quite truly and naturally , Robin!--don't regret it ! Only I want to explain to you that the Sieur Amadis was not like that -- he loved just once -- and the lady he loved must have been a very beautiful woman who had plenty of admirers and did not care for him at all . All he writes proves that . He is always grieved to the heart about it . Still he loved her -- and he seems glad to have loved her , though it was all no use . And he kept a little chronicle of his dreams and fancies -- all that he felt and thought about,--it is beautifully and tenderly written all in quaint old French . I had some trouble to make it out -- but I did at last -- every word -- and when he made up his mind to marry , he finished the little book and never wrote another word in it . Shall I tell you what were the last lines he wrote ? "
39896	39904	39905	39905	he	1015	" It would n't be any use , "
39913	39928	39929	39929	She	1016	held--"I do n't understand French . I 've never even tried to learn it . "
39932	40053	39929	39929	She	1016	" I know you have n't ! But you 've missed a great deal , Robin!--you have really ! When I made up my mind to find out all the Sieur Amadis had written , I got Priscilla to buy me a French dictionary and grammar and some other French lesson - books besides -- then I spelt all the words carefully and looked them all up in the dictionary , and learned the pronunciation from one of the lesson - books -- and by - and - bye it got quite easy . For two years at least it was dreadfully hard work -- but now -- well!--I think I could almost speak French if I had the chance ! "
40054	40061	40063	40063	Robin	84	" I 'm sure you could ! "
40069	40082	40063	40063	Robin	84	admiringly--"You're a clever little girl and could do anything you wanted to . "
40126	40140	40141	40141	she	1016	" Well , I wanted to understand the writing of the Sieur Amadis , "
40145	40183	40141	40141	she	1016	quietly--"and when I could understand them I translated them . So I can tell you the last words he wrote in his journal -- just before he married,--in fact on the very eve of his marriage - day-- "
40268	40272	40273	40273	he	84	" Go on , "
40274	40279	40589	40589	she	169	said--"What were the words ? "
40280	40281	40273	40273	he	84	" These"--and
40294	40581	40273	40273	he	84	feeling--"'Tonight I pull down and put away for ever the golden banner of my life 's ideal . It has been held aloft too long in the sunshine of a dream , and the lily broidered on its web is but a withered flower . My life is no longer of use to myself , but as a man and faithful knight I will make it serve another 's pleasure and another 's good . And because this good and simple girl doth truly love me , though her love was none of my seeking , I will give her her heart 's desire , though mine own heart 's desire shall never be accomplished,--I will make her my wife , and will be to her a true and loyal husband , so that she may receive from me all she craves of happiness and peace . For though I fain would die rather than we d , I know that life is not given to a man to live selfishly , nor is God satisfied to have it wasted by any one who hath sworn to be His knight and servant . Therefore even so let it be!--I give all my unvalued existence to her who doth consider it valuable , and with all my soul I pray that I may make so gentle and trustful a creature happy . But to Love -- oh , to Love a long farewell!--farewell my dreams!--farewell ambition!--farewell the glory of the vision unattainable!--farewell bright splendour of an earthly Paradise!--for now I enter that prison which shall hold me fast till death release me ! Close , doors!--fasten , locks!--be patient in thy silent solitude , my Soul ! ' "
40590	40602	40589	40589	she	169	said--"That is the end . He signed it ' Amadis . ' "
40613	40630	40631	40631	he	84	" It 's pretty -- very pretty and touching -- and all that sort of thing , "
40634	40656	40589	40589	she	169	last--"but it 's like some old sonnet or mediaeval bit of romance . No one would go on like that nowadays . "
40664	40670	40659	40659	her	169	" Go on like what ? "
40675	40694	40695	40695	He	84	" Oh , about being patient in solitude with one 's soul , and saying farewell to love . "
40701	40740	40695	40695	He	84	" Innocent dear , I wish you would see the world as it really is!--not through the old - style spectacles of the Sieur Amadis ! In his day people were altogether different from what they are now . "
40741	40748	40749	40749	she	169	" I 'm sure they were ! "
40752	40765	40749	40749	she	169	quietly--"But love is the same to - day as it was then . "
40774	40787	40788	40788	he	84	" No , dear , I 'm not sure that it is , "
40791	40850	40788	40788	he	84	" Those knights and poets and curious people of that kind lived in a sort of imaginary ecstasy -- they exaggerated their emotions and lived at the top - height of their fancies . We in our time are much more sane and level - headed . And it 's much better for us in the long run . "
40866	40875	40876	40876	he	84	" I 'm not a knight of old , "
40889	40940	40941	40941	He	84	her,--"but I 'm sure I love you as much as ever the Sieur Amadis could have loved his unknown lady . So much indeed do I love you that I could n't write about it to save my life!--though I did write verses at Oxford once -- very bad ones ! "
40944	40985	40941	40941	He	84	" But I can do one thing the Sieur Amadis did n't do -- I can keep faithful to my Vision of the glory unattainable'--and if I do n't marry you I 'll marry no - body -- so there ! "
40994	41002	41003	41003	she	1023	" You will not be so foolish , "
41004	41030	40941	40941	He	84	said--"You will not put me into the position of the Sieur Amadis , who married some one who loved him , merely out of pity ! "
41040	41115	41003	41003	she	1023	" No , no ! I wo n't do that , Innocent ! I 'm not a coward ! If you ca n't love me , you shall not marry me , just because you are sorry for me ! That would be intolerable ! I would n't have you for a wife at all under such circumstances . I shall be perfectly happy as a bachelor -- perhaps happier than if I married . "
41116	41123	41124	41124	she	1023	" And what about Briar Farm ? "
41127	41138	41139	41139	he	1024	" Briar Farm can get on as best it may ! "
41142	41239	41139	41139	he	1024	cheerily--"I'll work on it as long as I live and hand it down to some one worthy of it , never fear ! So there , Innocent!--be happy , and do n't worry yourself ! Keep to your old knight and your strange fancies about him -- you may be right in your ideas of love , or you may be wrong ; but the great point with me is that you should be happy -- and if you can not be happy in my way , why you must just be happy in your own ! "
41278	41287	41288	41288	she	1023	" You are really a very handsome boy ! "
41289	41305	41323	41323	he	1024	said--"Quite a picture in your way ! Some girl will be very proud of you ! "
41313	41322	41323	41323	he	1024	" I must go back to the orchard , "
41324	41352	41306	41306	He	1024	said--"There 's plenty to do . And after all , work 's the finest thing in the world -- quite as fine as love -- perhaps finer ! "
41403	41405	41361	41361	his	1024	" finer "
41445	41451	41452	41452	she	1023	" Going to the orchard ? "
41455	41458	41470	41470	He	1024	" Yes . "
41464	41469	41459	41459	She	1023	" That 's right ! "
41648	41653	41654	41654	he	1024	" Poor little girl ! "
41655	41680	41654	41654	he	1024	thought--"She does not know the world!--and when she DOES come to know it -- ah , my poor Innocent!--I would rather she never knew ! "
41899	41905	41906	41906	she	1023	" For when I go , "
41911	41919	41906	41906	she	1023	" they must find everything in order . "
42070	42075	42063	42063	She	1023	" Were you asleep ? "
42086	42092	42093	42093	he	84	" I believe I was ! "
42098	42108	42063	42063	She	1023	" And you would n't come in to tea ! "
42116	42129	42130	42130	he	84	" Oh yes , I would , if I had wanted tea , "
42131	42138	42063	42063	She	1023	replied--"but I did n't want it . "
42139	42147	42148	42148	she	1023	" Nor my company , I suppose , "
42164	42177	42178	42178	he	84	" Oh , I daresay that had something to do with it ! "
42305	42308	42309	42309	she	1023	" Robin , "
42310	42320	42285	42285	she	1023	said--"don't you think -- wouldn't it be better -- perhaps-- "
42334	42339	42340	42340	he	84	" What is it ? "
42341	42348	42309	42309	she	1023	asked--"Anything you want me to do ? "
42349	42350	42340	42340	he	84	" Yes"--and
42353	42386	42309	42309	she	1023	drooped--"but I hardly like to say it . You see , Dad made up his mind this morning that we were to settle things together -- and he 'll be angry and disappointed-- "
42396	42413	42414	42414	he	84	" He 'll be angry and disappointed if we do n't settle it , you mean , "
42415	42425	42447	42447	she	1023	said--"and we certainly have n't settled it . Well ? "
42433	42446	42447	42447	she	1023	" Could n't we pretend it 's all right for the moment ? "
42448	42458	42414	42414	he	84	suggested--"Just to give him a little peace of mind ? "
42465	42475	42414	42414	he	84	" You mean , could n't we deceive him ? "
42476	42499	42414	42414	he	84	" Yes!--for his good ! He has deceived ME all my life,--I suppose for MY good -- though it has turned out badly-- "
42500	42506	42414	42414	he	84	" Has it ? Why ? "
42507	42514	42515	42515	she	1023	" It has left me nameless , "
42516	42519	42414	42414	he	84	answered,--"and friendless . "
42572	42582	42583	42583	he	84	" Dear , I will do what you like ! "
42586	42595	42583	42583	he	84	" Tell me -- what is your wish ? "
42609	42611	42583	42583	he	84	" I thought"--she
42614	42653	42583	42583	he	84	then--"that we might tell Dad just for to - night that we are engaged -- it would make him happy -- and perhaps in a week or two we might get up a quarrel together and break it off-- "
42657	42682	42654	42654	Robin	84	" Dear little girl!--I'm afraid the plan would n't work ! He wants the banns put up on Sunday -- and this is Wednesday . "
42688	42696	42697	42697	she	1023	" Something can be managed before then , "
42700	42734	42697	42697	she	1023	" Robin , I can not bear to disappoint him ! He 's old -- and he 's so ill too!--it would n't hurt us for one night to say we are engaged ! "
42735	42737	42738	42738	Robin	84	" All right!"--and
42745	42786	42741	42741	his	84	joyously--"I do n't mind ! The sensation of even imagining I 'm engaged to you is quite agreeable ! For one evening , at least , I can assume a sort of proprietorship over you ! Innocent ! I -- I-- "
42806	42816	42817	42817	she	1023	" Well ? What are you thinking of now ? "
42820	42837	42838	42838	he	84	" I think -- I really think -- under the circumstances I ought to kiss you ! "
42839	42865	42909	42909	He	84	said--"Don't you feel it would be right and proper ? Even on the stage the hero and heroine ACT a kiss when they 're engaged ! "
42875	42883	42884	42884	she	1023	" I can not act a kiss , "
42885	42897	42838	42838	he	84	said--"You can , if you like ! I do n't mind . "
42898	42904	42884	42884	she	1023	" You do n't mind ? "
42905	42908	42838	42838	he	84	" No . "
42984	42997	42998	42998	he	84	" Dear Innocent , I would n't kiss you for the world ! "
43001	43038	42998	42998	he	84	gently--"It would be taking a mean advantage of you . I only spoke in fun . There!--dry your pretty eyes!--you sweet , strange , romantic little soul ! You shall have it all your own way ! "
43048	43055	43039	43039	She	414	" Then you 'll tell your uncle-- "
43056	43061	43062	43062	he	84	" Anything you like ! "
43065	43082	43062	43062	he	84	" By - the - bye , ought n't he to be home by this time ? "
43083	43093	43094	43094	she	414	" He may have been kept by some business , "
43095	43109	43062	43062	he	84	said--"He wo n't be long now . You 'll say we 're engaged ? "
43110	43113	43094	43094	she	414	" Yes . "
43114	43116	43062	43062	he	84	" And perhaps"--went
43118	43140	43094	43094	she	414	Innocent--"you might ask him not to have the banns put up yet as we do n't want it known quite so soon-- "
43141	43149	43150	43150	he	84	" I 'll do all I can , "
43153	43175	43150	43150	he	84	cheerily--"all I can to keep him quiet , and to make you happy ! There ! I ca n't say more ! "
43186	43194	43176	43176	Her	414	" You are very good , Robin ! "
43198	43313	43176	43176	Her	414	" Good ! Not I ! But I ca n't bear to see you fret -- if I had my way you should never know a moment 's trouble that I could keep from you . But I know I 'm not a patch on your old stone knight who wrote such a lot about his ' ideal'--and yet went and married a country wench and had six children . Do n't frown , dear ! Nothing will make me say he was romantic ! Not a bit of it ! He wrote a lot of romantic things , of course -- but he did n't mean half of them!--I'm sure he did n't ! "
43318	43329	43330	43330	she	1036	" You say that because you know nothing about it , "
43331	43338	43195	43195	He	84	said--"You have not read his writings . "
43339	43352	43353	43353	he	1036	" No -- and I 'm not sure that I want to , "
43358	43452	43353	43353	he	1036	" Dear Innocent , you must remember that I was at Oxford -- my dear old father and mother scraped and screwed every penny they could get to send me there -- and I believe I acquitted myself pretty well -- but one of the best things I learned was the general uselessness and vanity of the fellows that called themselves ' literary . ' They chiefly went in for disparaging and despising everyone who did not agree with them and think just as they did . Mulish prigs , most of them ! "
43462	43518	43456	43456	his	84	more--"They did n't know that I was all the time comparing them with the honest type of farmer -- the man who lives an outdoor life with God 's air blowing upon him , and the soil turned freshly beneath him!--I love books , too , in my way , but I love Nature better . "
43519	43530	43532	43532	Innocent	152	" And do not poets help you to understand Nature ? "
43534	43603	43604	43604	Innocent	152	" The best of them do -- such as Shakespeare and Keats and Tennyson,--but they were of the past . The modern men make you almost despise Nature,--more 's the pity ! They are always studying THEMSELVES , and analysing THEMSELVES , and pitying THEMSELVES -- now _ I _ always say , the less of one 's self the better , in order to understand other people . "
43613	43623	43624	43624	she	152	" Yes , you are a thoroughly good boy , "
43625	43651	43667	43667	she	152	said--"I have told you so often . But -- I'm not sure that I should always get on with anyone as good as you are ! "
43677	43688	43667	43667	she	152	" Cupid ! Cupid ! Cu - COO - pid ! "
43898	43907	43882	43882	his	84	" Uncle at last ! Here he comes ! "
43974	43983	43985	43985	Innocent	152	" Are n't you very late , Dad ? "
43991	43999	43985	43985	Innocent	152	him--"I was beginning to be quite anxious ! "
44000	44024	44026	44026	he	87	" Were you ? Poor little one ! I 'm all right ! I had business -- I was kept longer than I expected-- "
44030	44038	44026	44026	he	87	Robin--"Unharness , boy!--unharness!--and come in to supper ! "
44039	44044	44046	44046	Robin	84	" Where 's Landon ? "
44048	44061	44062	44062	He	87	" Landon ? Oh , I 've left him in the town . "
44227	44237	44238	44238	he	87	" Anxious about me , were you , child ? "
44249	44292	44238	44238	he	87	" Well , well ! you need not have given me a thought ! I -- I was all right -- all right ! I made a bit of a bargain in the town -- but the prices were high -- and Landon-- "
44332	44343	44349	44349	his	87	" Yes , Dad ? You were saying something about Landon-- "
44362	44413	44352	44352	he	87	" Landon ? Did I speak of him ? Oh yes!--Landon met with some fellows he knew and decided to spend the evening with them -- he asked me for a night off -- and I gave it to him . Yes -- I -- I gave it to him . "
44419	44422	44423	44423	he	84	" Hullo ! "
44426	44448	44423	44423	he	84	gaily--"At supper ? Do n't begin without me ! I say , Uncle , is Landon coming back to - night ? "
44455	44458	44459	44459	he	84	" No ! "
44470	44509	44449	44449	Jocelyn	120	amazed--"Why do you all keep on asking me about Landon ? He loves drink more than life , and he 's having all he wants to - night . I 've let him off work to - morrow . "
44521	44536	44537	44537	he	84	" Oh well , that 's all right , if you do n't mind , "
44541	44554	44537	44537	he	84	last--"We're pretty busy -- but I daresay we can manage without him . "
44555	44561	44563	44563	Hugo	87	" I should think so ! "
44569	44590	44563	44563	Hugo	87	scorn--"Briar Farm would have come to a pretty pass if it could not get on without a man like Landon ! "
44621	44633	44634	44634	she	121	" Well , Landon or no Landon , supper 's ready ! "
44637	44658	44634	44634	she	121	briskly--"and it 's been waiting an hour at least . Say grace , Mister Jocelyn , and I 'll carve ! "
44665	44669	44670	44670	he	84	" Say grace ? "
44671	44674	44675	44675	Priscilla	121	queried--"what for ? "
44685	44729	44675	44675	Priscilla	121	" What for ? Lor , Mister Jocelyn , if you do n't know I 'm sure I do n't ! For the beef and potatoes , I suppose , an ' all the stuff we eats--'for what we are going to receive-- ' "
44730	44745	44747	44747	Jocelyn	120	" Ah , yes ! I remember--'May the Lord make us truly thankful ! ' "
44759	44786	44747	44747	Jocelyn	120	again--"And I 'll tell you what , Priscilla!--there 's a deal more to be thankful for to - night than beef and potatoes!--a great deal more ! "
44866	44868	44856	44857	his uncle	514	" settled "
45015	45025	45026	45026	she	152	" You be off to bed , Mister Jocelyn , "
45027	45065	45001	45003	the practical Priscilla	121	said,--"The sooner the better , for you look as tired as a lame dog that ' as limped ' ome twenty miles . You ai n't fit to be racketing about markets an ' drivin ' bargains . "
45066	45073	45074	45074	he	426	" Who says I 'm not ? "
45084	45145	45074	45074	he	426	her--"I tell you I am ! I can do business as well as any man -- and drive a bargain - ah ! I should think so indeed!--a hard - and - fast bargain!--not easy to get out of , I can tell you!--not easy to get out of ! And it has cost me a pretty penny , too ! "
45153	45158	45159	45159	he	426	" How 's that ? "
45160	45167	45146	45147	Robin Clifford	84	asked--"You generally make rather than spend ! "
45175	45249	45168	45168	Jocelyn	120	" So I do , boy , so I do ! But sometimes one has to spend to make ! I 've done both to - day -- I've made and I 've spent . And what I 've spent is better than keeping it -- and what I 've made -- ay!--what I 've made -- well!--it 's a bargain , and no one can say it is n't a fair one ! "
45263	45268	45269	45269	he	426	" I 'll go , "
45270	45287	45288	45288	He	426	said--"Priscilla 's right -- I'm dog - tired and bed 's the best place for me . "
45296	45319	45288	45288	He	426	" There 's a sort of buzzing in my brain like the noise of a cart - wheel -- I want rest . "
45343	45376	45334	45334	He	426	" Yes , wilding , I want rest ! We 'll have a long talk out tomorrow -- you and I and Robin . Bless thee , child ! Good - night ! "
45394	45398	45399	45399	he	426	" Good boy ! "
45400	45444	45445	45445	He	426	said-"Be up early , for there 's much to do -- and Landon wo n't be home till late -- no -- not till late ! Get on with the field work -- for if the clouds mean anything we shall have rain . "
45456	45476	45445	45445	He	426	slowly--"Yes , lad ! We shall have rain!--and wind , and storm ! Be ready!--the fine weather 's breaking ! "
45537	45555	45556	45556	she	121	" Well , if Mister Jocelyn worn't as sober a man as any judge an ' jury , "
45557	45592	45522	45522	she	121	observed--"I should say ' e'd bin drinkin ' ! But that ai n't it . Mr. Robin , there 's somethin' gone wrong with ' im -- an ' I do n't like it . "
45593	45597	45599	45599	Innocent	152	" Nor I , "
45610	45638	45599	45599	Innocent	152	" Oh , Robin , you surely noticed how strange he looked ! I 'm so afraid ! I feel as if something dreadful was going to happen-- "
45639	45642	45644	45644	Robin	126	" Nonsense ! "
45655	45688	45651	45651	he	126	feeling--"Uncle Hugo is tired -- I think he has been put out -- you know he 's quick - tempered and easily irritated -- he may have had some annoyance in the town-- "
45689	45697	45700	45700	Priscilla	121	" Ah ! And where 's Landon ? "
45705	45752	45700	45700	Priscilla	121	nod--"That do beat me ! Why ever the master should ' ave let a man like that go on the loose for a night an ' a day is more than I can make out ! It 's sort of tempting Providence -- that it is ! "
45804	45859	45802	45802	he	84	" Oh , well , there 's nothing very much in that , Priscilla ! I daresay Landon wanted a holiday -- he does n't ask for one often , and he 's kept fairly sober lately . Had n't we better be off to bed ? Things will straighten out with the morning . "
45860	45867	45871	45871	she	152	" Do you really think so ? "
45876	45883	45885	45885	Robin	84	" Of course I think so ! "
45889	45920	45885	45885	Robin	84	" We 're all tired , and ca n't look on the bright side ! Sound sleep is the best cure for the blues ! Good - night , Innocent ! "
45921	45926	45927	45927	she	152	" Good - night ! "
45932	45939	45885	45885	Robin	84	" Good - night , Priscilla ! "
45940	45952	45982	45982	he	84	" Good - night , Mr. Robin . God bless ye ! "
45967	45975	45977	45977	Priscilla	121	" There 's a man for ye ! "
45983	46007	45982	45982	he	84	disappeared--"A tower of strength for a ' usband , which the Lord knows is rare ! Lovey , you 'll never do better ! "
46030	46036	46037	46037	she	121	" Dad looks very ill , "
46040	46045	46037	46037	she	121	slowly--"Priscilla , surely you noticed-- "
46046	46056	46057	46057	Priscilla	121	" Now , child , do n't you worry--'tain't no use"--and
46065	46125	46057	46057	Priscilla	121	one--"You just go up to bed and think of nothing till the morning . Mister Jocelyn is dead beat and put out about something -- precious ' ungry too , for he ate his food as though he had n't ' ad any all day . You could n't expect him to be pleasant if he was wore out . "
46223	46234	46235	46235	she	121	" Good - night , you dear , kind Priscilla ! "
46236	46243	46219	46219	she	152	said--"You've always been good to me ! "
46244	46251	46253	46253	Priscilla	121	" Bless you , my lovey ! "
46256	46292	46253	46253	Priscilla	121	emotion--"Go and sleep with the angels , like the little angel you are yourself ! And mind you think twice , and more than twice , before you say ' No ' to Mr. Robin ! "
46339	46343	46344	46344	she	152	" found peace , "
46505	46510	46501	46501	he	143	" putting up the banns "
46661	46669	46670	46670	she	152	" I really think it might do ! "
46673	46709	46670	46670	she	152	aloud--"I should not be afraid to try ! Who knows what might happen ? I can but fail -- or succeed . If I fail , I shall have had my lesson -- if I succeed-- "
46731	46806	46710	46710	She	152	" If I succeed!--ah!--if I do ! Then I 'll pay back everything I owe to Dad and Briar Farm!--oh , no ! I can never pay back my debt to Briar Farm!--that would be impossible ! Why , the very fields and trees and flowers and birds have made me happy!--happier than I shall ever be after I have said good - bye to them all!--good - bye even to the Sieur Amadis ! "
46826	46832	46833	46833	she	152	" Yes , after all , "
46843	46994	46833	46833	she	152	" it 's better and braver to try to do something in the world , rather than throw myself upon Robin , and be cowardly enough to take him for a husband when I do n't love him . Just for comfort and shelter and Briar Farm ! It would be shameful . And I could not marry a man unless I loved him quite desperately!--I could not ! I 'm not sure that I like the idea of marriage at all,--it fastens a man and woman together for life , and the time might come when they would grow tired of each other . How cruel and wicked it would be to force them to endure each other 's company when they perhaps wished the width of the world between them ! No -- I do n't think I should care to be married -- certainly not to Robin . "

47783	47786	47788	47788	she	1088	" Why ? "
47798	47813	47814	47814	she	1088	" Oh no , no ! Let me be with you -- let me call him!"--and

47909	47930	47931	47931	she	121	whispered--"It 's no good and you 're in the way when they open the door . Come with me!--there 's a dear!"--and
47942	47949	47951	47951	she	121	" There!--that'll be a bit warmer ! "

48130	48185	48127	48127	she	121	" He has fainted -- we must lift him -- get some one to lift him on the bed . It is only a faint -- he will recover -- get some brandy and send for the doctor . Do n't lose time!--for Heaven 's sake be quick ! Robin , make them hurry ! "
48301	48308	48309	48309	she	152	" He will be better soon , "
48310	48398	48423	48423	Priscilla	121	said,--"Priscilla , bring me that brandy -- just a little will revive him , I 'm sure . Why do you stand there crying ? You surely do n't think he 's dead?--No , no , that is n't possible ! It is n't possible , is it , Robin ? He 'll come to himself in a few minutes -- a fainting fit may last quite a long time . I wish he had not locked his door -- we could have been with him sooner . "
48483	48492	48493	48493	she	121	" I can not make him swallow it , "
48494	48511	48473	48473	she	121	said--"Can you , Robin ? He looks so grey and cold!--but his lips are quite warm . "
48543	48560	48561	48561	he	84	" Dear , if you could leave him for a little it would perhaps be better , "
48564	48585	48561	48561	he	84	" He might -- he might recover sooner . We have sent for the doctor -- he will be here directly-- "
48586	48595	48597	48598	the girl	414	" I will stay here till he comes , "
48602	48624	48597	48598	the girl	414	" How can you think I would leave Dad when he 's ill ? If we could only rouse him a little-- "

48853	48875	48850	48850	he	2825	" He must have fallen forward on getting out of bed . I rather expected a sudden seizure of this kind . "

49000	49011	48980	48981	The doctor	2825	said--"in the next -- perhaps ! Let us hope so ! "
49025	49030	49031	49031	she	152	" He is dead ! "

51253	51262	51263	51263	she	403	" It is kind of you to come , "
51338	51350	51351	51351	he	1151	" I am very sorry to hear of your sad bereavement , "
51360	51363	51351	51351	he	1151	tone--"very sorry indeed-- "
51370	51459	51364	51364	She	403	" Are you ? I do n't think you can be sorry , because you did not know him -- if you had known him , you would have been really grieved -- yes , I am sure you would . He was such a good man!--one of the best in all the world ! I 'm glad you have come to see me , because I have often wanted to speak to you -- and perhaps now is the right time . Wo n't you sit down ? "
51543	51551	51552	51552	she	1167	" I have never seen death before , "
51557	51668	51552	51552	she	1167	tones--"except in birds and flowers and animals -- and I have cried over the poor things for sorrow that they should be taken away out of this beautiful world . But with Dad it is different . He was afraid -- afraid of suffering and weakness -- and he was taken so quickly that he could hardly have felt anything -- so that his fears were all useless . And I can hardly believe he is dead -- actually dead -- can you ? But of course you do not believe in death at all -- the religion you teach is one of eternal life -- eternal life and happiness . "
51679	51686	51675	51675	he	184	" living again in the Lord . "
51706	51709	51710	51710	she	152	" Listen ! "
51711	51919	51920	51921	Mr. Medwin	184	said--"When Priscilla told me Dad was really dead -- that he would never get off the bed where he lay so cold and white and peaceful,--that he would never speak to me again , I said she was wrong -- that it could not be . I told her he would wake presently and laugh at us all for being so foolish as to think him dead . Even Hero , our mastiff , does not believe it , for he has stayed all morning by the bedside and no one dare touch him to take him away . And just now Priscilla has been with me , crying very much -- and she says I must not grieve,--because Dad is gone to a better world . Then surely he must be alive if he is able to go anywhere , must he not ? I asked her what she knew about this better world , and she cried again and said indeed she knew nothing except what she had been taught in her Catechism . I have read the Catechism and it seems to me very stupid and unnatural -- perhaps because I do not understand it . Can you tell me about this better world ? "
51932	51937	51938	51938	he	184	" I 'm afraid , "
51939	51961	51929	51929	his	184	observed--"I'm very much afraid , my poor child , that you have been brought up in a sad state of ignorance . "
51969	51971	51972	51972	she	152	" poor child"--and
51980	51987	51988	51988	she	152	" Please do not pity me , "
51995	52079	51972	51972	she	152	hauteur--"I do not wish that ! I know it is difficult for me to explain things to you as I see them , because I have never been taught religion from a Church . I have read about the Virgin and Christ and the Saints and all those pretty legends in the books that belonged to the Sieur Amadis -- but he lived three hundred years ago and he was a Roman Catholic , as all those French noblemen were at that time . "
52104	52144	52095	52095	She	152	" Dad believed in a God who governed all things rightly,--I have heard him say that God managed the farm and made it what it is . But he never spoke much about it -- and he hated the Church-- "
52156	52160	52161	52161	he	138	" I know ! "
52162	52184	52145	52147	The reverend gentleman	1131	sighed--"Ah yes , I know ! A dreadful thing!--a shocking attitude of mind ! ' I fear he was not saved ! "
52191	52200	52201	52201	she	152	" I do n't see what you mean , "
52202	52208	52161	52161	he	138	said--"He was quite a good man-- "
52209	52216	52218	52219	Mr. Medwin	184	" Are you sure of that ? "
52229	52236	52221	52221	his	184	" Our affections are often very deceptive-- "
52246	52253	52254	52254	she	152	" Indeed I am very sure ! "
52257	52292	52254	52254	she	152	steadily--"He was a good man . There was never a stain on his character -- though he allowed people to think wrong things of him for my sake . That was his only fault . "
52303	52313	52314	52314	she	152	" I think perhaps I ought to tell you , "
52315	52348	52349	52350	Mr. Medwin	184	continued--"because then you will be able to judge him better and spare his memory from foolish and wicked scandal . He was not my father -- I was only his adopted daughter . "
52361	52363	52349	52350	Mr. Medwin	184	" Adopted "
52376	52388	52389	52389	she	152	" I never knew my own history till the other day , "
52396	52503	52389	52389	she	152	" The doctor came to see Dad , with a London specialist , a friend of his -- and they told him he had not long to live . After that Dad made up his mind that I must learn all the truth of myself -- oh!--what a terrible truth it was!--I thought my heart would break ! It was so strange -- so cruel ! I had grown up believing myself to be Dad 's own , very own daughter!--and I had been deceived all my life!--for he told me I was nothing but a nameless child , left on his hands by a stranger ! "
52552	52558	52547	52547	he	184	" cock - and - bull "
52561	52565	52566	52566	he	184	" Most extraordinary ! "
52570	52584	52566	52566	he	184	last--"Did he give you no clue at all as to your actual parentage ? "
52590	52665	52587	52587	her	152	" How could he ? A man on horseback arrived here suddenly one very stormy night , carrying me in his arms -- I was just a little baby -- and asked shelter for me , promising to come and fetch me in the morning -- but he never came -- and Dad never knew who he was . I was kept here out of pity at first -- then Dad began to love me-- "
52678	52687	52688	52688	she	152	" Priscilla can tell you all about it , "
52691	52753	52688	52688	she	152	tremulously--"if you wish to know more . I am only explaining things a little because I do want you to understand that Dad was really a good man though he did not go to Church -- and he must have been ' saved , ' as you put it , for he never did anything unworthy of the name of Jocelyn ! "
52760	52769	52770	52770	he	1151	" You are not Miss Jocelyn , then ? "
52782	52796	52773	52773	She	152	" No . I am nobody . I have not even been baptised . "
52806	52810	52811	52811	he	1151	" Not baptised ! "
52812	52845	52773	52773	She	152	exclaimed--"Not baptised ! Do you mean to tell me that Farmer Jocelyn never attended to this imperative and sacred duty on your behalf?--that he allowed you to grow up as a heathen ? "
52853	52860	52861	52861	she	152	" I am not a heathen , "
52864	52894	52861	52861	she	152	gently--"I believe in God -- as Dad believed . I 'm sorry I have not been baptised -- but it has made no difference to me that I know of-- "
52895	52899	52901	52902	the clergyman	1151	" No difference ! "
52911	52950	52905	52905	his	1151	ponderously--"You poor unfortunate girl , it has made all the difference in the world ! You are unregenerate -- your soul is not washed clean -- all your sins are upon you , and you are not redeemed ! "
52957	52970	52971	52971	she	152	" That is all very sad for me if it is true , "
52972	53105	53148	53148	she	1174	said--"but it is not my fault . I could not help it . Dad could n't help it either -- he did not know what to do . He expected that I might be claimed and taken away any day -- and he had no idea what name to give me -- except Innocent -- which is a name I suppose no girl ever had before . He used to get money from time to time in registered envelopes , bearing different foreign postmarks -- and there was always a slip of paper inside with the words ' For Innocent ' written on it . So that name has been my only name . You see , it was very difficult for him -- poor Dad!--besides , he did not believe in baptism-- "
53106	53113	53115	53116	Mr. Medwin	184	" Then he was an infidel ! "
53128	53147	53148	53148	she	1174	" I do n't think you should say that -- it is n't quite kind on your part , "
53149	53304	53120	53120	Her	1174	replied--"He always thanked God for prosperity , and never complained when things went wrong -- that is not being an infidel ! Even when he knew he was hopelessly ill , he never worried anyone about it -- he was only just a little afraid - and that was perfectly natural . We 're all a little afraid , you know -- though we pretend we 're not -- none of us like the idea of leaving this lovely world and the sunshine for ever . Even Hamlet was afraid,--Shakespeare makes him say so . And when one has lived all one 's life on Briar Farm -- such a sweet peaceful home!--one can hardly fancy anything better , even in a next world ! No -- Dad was not an infidel -- please do not think such a thing!--he only died last night -- and I feel as if it would hurt him . "
53342	53360	53361	53361	he	184	" Well -- to me , of course , it is a very shocking state of affairs , "
53364	53410	53361	53361	he	184	irritably--"I hardly think I can be of any use -- or consolation to you in the matters you have spoken of , which are quite outside my scope altogether . If you have anything to say about the funeral arrangements -- but I presume Mr. Clifford-- "
53411	53419	53420	53420	she	414	" Mr. Clifford is master here now , "
53421	53523	53361	53361	he	184	answered--"He will give his own orders , and will do all that is best and wisest . As I have told you , I am a name - less nobody , and have no right in this house at all . I 'm sorry if I have vexed or troubled you -- but as you called I thought it was right to tell you how I am situated . You see , when poor Dad is buried I shall be going away at once -- and I had an idea you might perhaps help me -- you are God 's minister . "
53535	53542	53543	53543	he	1176	" You are leaving Briar Farm ? "
53546	53557	53361	53361	he	184	" I must . I have no right to stay . "
53558	53566	53524	53524	He	1176	" Is Mr. Clifford turning you out ? "
53582	53607	53608	53608	she	1177	" Ah , no ! No , indeed ! He would not turn a dog out that had once taken food from his hand , "
53611	53662	53608	53608	she	1177	" It is my own wish entirely . When Dad was alive there was something for me to do in taking care of him -- but now!--there is no need for me -- I should feel in the way -- besides , I must try to earn my own living . "
53663	53671	53673	53674	Mr. Medwin	184	" What do you propose to do ? "
53690	53696	53673	53674	Mr. Medwin	184	aggressive--"Do you want a situation ? "
53708	53744	53697	53697	She	1177	" Yes -- I should like one very much -- I could be a lady 's maid , I think , I can sew very well . But -- perhaps you would baptise me first ? "
53756	53762	53745	53745	He	184	" Eh ? Baptise you ? "
53763	53795	53796	53796	Her	1177	" Yes,--because if I am unregenerate , and my soul is not clean , as you say , no one would take me -- not even as a lady 's maid . "
53810	53825	53796	53796	Her	1177	" I 'm afraid you are not sufficiently aware of the importance of the sacred rite,"--he
53828	53889	53796	53796	Her	1177	severely--"At your age you would need to be instructed for some weeks before you could be considered fit and worthy . Then,--you tell me you have no name!--Innocent is not a name at all for a woman -- I do not know who you are -- you are ignorant of your parentage -- you may have been born out of wedlock-- "
53894	53902	53903	53903	she	1177	" I am not sure of that , "
53911	53929	53930	53932	the reverend gentleman	1131	" No -- of course you are not sure,--but I should say the probability is that you are illegitimate"--and
53940	53985	53930	53932	the reverend gentleman	1131	" The whole business is very perplexing and difficult . However , I will see what can be done for you -- but you are in a very awkward corner!--very awkward indeed ! Life will not be very easy for you , I fear ! "
53986	53993	53994	53994	she	1177	" I do not expect ease , "
53995	54018	53930	53932	the reverend gentleman	1131	replied--"I have been very happy till now -- and I am grateful for the past . I must make my own future . "
54071	54088	54089	54089	he	1151	" I hope -- I fervently trust -- that God will support you in your bereavement , "
54092	54151	54089	54089	he	1151	unctuously--"I had intended before leaving to offer up a prayer with you for the soul of the departed and for your own soul -- but the sad fact of your being unbaptised places me in a difficulty . But I shall not fail personally to ask our Lord to prepare you for the unfortunate change in your lot ! "
54152	54156	54157	54157	she	1177	" Thank you ! "
54277	54281	54282	54282	she	1177	" Poor Cupid ! "
54283	54351	54272	54272	She	1177	murmured--"You are like me -- you are unregenerate!--you have never been baptised!--your soul has not been washed clean!--and all your sins are on your head ! Yes , Cupid!--we are very much alike!--for I do n't suppose you know your own father and mother any more than I know mine ! And yet God made you -- and He has taken care of you -- so far ! "
54427	54440	54441	54441	she	1184	" Eh , Mr. Clifford -- it 's you , is it ? "
54448	54497	54441	54441	she	1184	" An ' Farmer Jocelyn 's dead!--who'd a ' thought it ! But I 'd ' ave ' ad a bone to pick with ' i m this mornin ' , if he 'd been livin'--that I would!--givin ' sack to Ned Landon without a warning to me ! "
54572	54582	54525	54526	Hugo Jocelyn	143	" I 've come up to speak with ye , "
54585	54622	54623	54623	She	1184	woman,--"It 's pretty ' ard on me to be left in the ditch , with a man tumbling ye off his horse an ' ridin ' away where ye ca n't get at ' i m ! "
54627	54635	54623	54623	She	1184	" Ned 's gone to ' Merriker ! "
54636	54639	54623	54623	She	1184	" Gone to America!"--Robin
54648	54659	54623	54623	She	1184	surprise--"Ned Landon ? Why , when did you hear that ? "
54660	54713	54623	54623	She	1184	" Just now -- his own letter came with the carrier 's cart -- he left the town last night and takes ship from Southampton to - day . And why ? Because Farmer Jocelyn gave him five hundred pounds to do it ! So there 's some real news for ye ! "
54714	54719	54623	54623	She	1184	" Five hundred pounds ! "
54721	54730	54623	54623	She	1184	Clifford--"My Uncle Hugo gave him five hundred pounds ! "
54731	54736	54737	54738	the woman	3205	" Ay , ye may stare!"--and
54740	54795	54737	54738	the woman	3205	again--"And the devil has taken it all,--except a five - pun ' note which he sends to me to ' keep me goin' , ' he says . Like his cheek ! I 'm not his wife , that 's true!--but I 'm as much as any wife -- an ' there 's the kid-- "
54805	54808	54809	54809	he	84	" Hush ! "
54810	54814	54623	54623	She	1184	said--"don't talk so loud-- "
54815	54822	54823	54823	she	3205	" The dead ca n't hear , "
54826	54983	54823	54823	she	3205	scornfully--"an ' Ned says in his letter that he 's been sent off all on account of you an ' your light o ' love -- Innocent , she 's called -- a precious ' innocent ' SHE is!--an ' that the old man has paid ' i m to go away an ' ' old his tongue ! So it 's all YOUR fault , after all , that I 'm left with the kid to rub along anyhow;--he might ave married me in a while , if he 'd stayed . I 'm only Jenny o ' Mill - Dykes now -- just as I 've always been -- the toss an ' catch of every man!--but I ' ad a grip on Ned with the kid , an ' he 'd a ' done me right in the end if you an ' your precious ' innocent ' ' adn't been in the way-- "
54992	54999	55000	55000	he	84	" Go out of this place ! "
55003	55012	55000	55000	he	84	fiercely--"How dare you come here with such lies ! "
55036	55042	55043	55043	she	116	" Lies , is it ? "
55044	55137	55030	55030	her	116	said--"Well , lies make good crops , an ' Farmer Jocelyn 's money'll ' elp them to grow ! Lies , indeed ! An ' how dare I come here ? Why , because your old uncle is stiff an ' cold an ' ca n't speak no more -- an ' no one would know what ' ad become o ' Ned Landon if I was n't here to tell them an ' show his own letter ! I 'll tell them all , right enough!--you bet your life I will ! "
55171	55180	55181	55181	he	84	" If you say one word about Miss Jocelyn-- "
55184	55188	55189	55189	she	116	" Miss Jocelyn ! "
55192	55196	55197	55197	she	116	shrilly--"That 's good!--we ARE grand!"--and
55202	55238	55239	55239	she	116	curtsey--"Miss Jocelyn ! There ai n't no ' Miss Jocelyn , ' an ' you know it as well as I do ! So do n't try to fool ME ! Look here , Mr. Robin Clifford"--and
55245	55336	55239	55239	she	116	akimbo--"you're not a Jocelyn neither!--there 's not a Jocelyn left o ' the old stock -- they're all finished with the one lyin ' dead upstairs yonder -- and I 'll tell ye what!--you an ' your ' innocent ' are too ' igh an ' mighty altogether for the likes o ' we poor villagers -- seein ' ye ai n't got nothin' to boast of , neither of ye ! You 've lost me my man -- an ' I 'll let everyone know how an ' why ! "
55468	55473	55475	55477	the young man	435	" Poor Uncle Hugo ! "
55504	55560	55578	55578	Innocent	152	Jocelyns--"What a mistake you have made ! You meant so well!--you thought you were doing a wise thing in sending Landon away -- and at such a cost!--but you did not know what he had left behind him -- Jenny of the Mill - Dykes , whose wicked tongue would blacken an angel 's reputation ! "
55597	55601	55602	55602	she	152	" Poor Robin ! "
55605	55612	55602	55602	she	152	softly--"Don't worry ! I heard everything . "
55619	55623	55613	55613	He	435	" You heard-- ? "
55624	55679	55684	55684	Robin	84	" Yes . I was at the open window there -- I could n't help hearing . It was Jenny of the Mill - Dykes -- I know her by sight , but not to speak to -- Priscilla told me something about her . She is n't a nice woman , is she ? "
55680	55683	55684	55684	Robin	84	" Nice ? "
55685	55701	55684	55684	Robin	84	gasped--"No , indeed ! She is -- Well!--I must not tell you what she is ! "
55702	55776	55684	55684	Robin	84	" No!--you must not -- I do n't want to hear . But she ought to be Ned Landon 's wife -- I understood that!--and she has a little child . I understood that too . And she knows everything about me -- and about that night when you climbed up on my window - sill and sat there so long . It was a pity you did that , was n't it ? "
55777	55787	55789	55789	Robin	84	" Yes!--when there was a dirty spy in hiding ! "
55793	55804	55805	55805	she	1197	" Ah!--we never imagined such a thing could be on Briar Farm!"--and
55806	55844	55684	55684	Robin	84	sighed--"but it ca n't be helped now . Poor darling Dad ! He parted with all that money to get rid of the man he thought would do me wrong . Oh Robin , he loved me ! "
55867	55877	55879	55879	Robin	84	" He loved you , and I love you ! "
55883	55986	55879	55879	Robin	84	" Dear little girl , come indoors and do n't cry any more ! Your sweet eyes will be spoilt , and Uncle Hugo could never bear to see you weeping . All the tears in the world wo n't bring him back to us here,--but we can do our best to please him still , so that if his spirit has ever been troubled , it can be at peace . Come in and let us talk quietly together -- we must look at things squarely and straightly , and we must try to do all the things he would have wished-- "
55987	55993	55994	55994	she	1198	" All except one thing , "
56006	56014	55879	55879	Robin	84	house--"the one thing that can never be ! "
56015	56027	56029	56029	Robin	84	" The one thing -- the chief thing that shall be ! "
56031	56039	56029	56029	Robin	84	fiercely--"Innocent , you must be my wife ! "
56068	56072	56073	56073	she	1198	" Robin,--dear Robin ! "
56074	56164	56040	56040	She	1198	said--"Don't make it harder for me than it is ! Think for a moment ! I am nameless -- a poor , unbaptised , deserted creature who was flung on your uncle 's charity eighteen years ago -- I am a stranger and intruder in this old historic place -- I have no right to be here at all -- only through your uncle 's kindness and yours .

Oh , Robin , be kind!--you always are!--let me go by myself and watch Dad put to rest where nobody can see me . For after they have laid him down and left him , they will be talking ! "

59968	60019	59810	59810	she	121	said--"And I 'm not sure that I want to understand it -- not now . What love I had in my heart is all buried -- with Dad and the roses . I am not the same girl any more -- I feel a different creature -- grown quite old ! "
60020	60030	60031	60031	he	1278	" You can not feel older than I do , "
60032	60132	59810	59810	she	121	replied--"but you do not think of me at all,--why should you ? I never used to think you selfish , Innocent!--you have always been so careful and considerate of the feelings of others -- yet now!--well!--are you not so much absorbed in your own grief as to be forgetful of mine ? For mine is a double grief -- a double loss -- I have lost my uncle and best friend -- and I shall lose you because you will not love me , though I love you with all my heart and only want to make you happy ! "
60147	60153	60031	60031	he	1278	" You think me selfish ? "

60165	60197	60031	60031	he	1278	said--"You think I ought to sacrifice myself to you , and to Dad 's last wish . You would expect me to spoil your life by marrying you unwillingly and without love-- "
60198	60208	60209	60209	he	1280	" I tell you you know nothing about love ! "
60215	60220	60221	60221	she	1279	" So you imagine , "
60223	60350	60221	60221	she	1279	quietly--"but I do know one thing -- and it is that no one who really loves a person wishes to see that person , unhappy . To love anybody means that above all things in the world you desire to see the beloved one well and prosperous and full of gladness . You can not love me or you would not wish me to do a thing that would make me miserable . If I loved you , I would marry you and devote my life to yours -- but I do not love you , and , therefore , I should only make you wretched if I became your wife . Do not let us talk of this any more -- it tires me out ! "
60363	60380	60381	60381	she	1281	" It is wrong to talk of ourselves at all when Dad is only just buried , "

He shall not sell any part of the land for building purposes , nor shall he dispose of any of the furniture , pewter , plate , china , glass , or other effects belonging to Briar Farm House,--but shall carefully preserve the same and hand them down to his lawful heirs in succession on the same terms as heretofore'--etc . , etc . ,--yes!--well!--that is the gist of the business , and we need not go over the details . With the farm and lands aforesaid he leaves the sum of Twenty Thousand Pounds-- "

61031	61039	61041	61042	Mr. Bayliss--"and	211	" It is a nice little fortune , "
61042	61072	61041	61042	Mr. Bayliss--"and	211	Bayliss--"and you come into it at a time of life when you will be able to make good use of it . Especially if you should be inclined to marry-- "

61173	61182	61122	61122	Robin	84	replied--"I am not a real descendant of the Jocelyns-- "

61765	61798	61764	61764	she	152	said--"He was always good -- too good and generous -- but if they are mine , I give them to Mr. Clifford . There is nothing more to be said about them . "
61804	61830	61764	61764	she	152	" Well -- that is all that is contained in this casket , with the exception of a paper unsealed -- shall I read it ? "
61836	61853	61855	61856	the lawyer	1289	" The paper is written in Mr. Jocelyn 's own hand , and is as follows , "
61858	61935	61855	61856	the lawyer	1289	" I desire that my adopted child , known as ' Innocent , ' shall receive into her own possession the Jocelyn pearls , valued by experts at L2,500 , and that she shall wear the same on her marriage - morning . The sealed packet , placed in this casket with the pearls afore - said , contains a letter for her own personal and private perusal , and other matter which concerns herself alone . "
61946	61966	61967	61967	She	152	" From these words it is evident that the sealed packet you have there is an affair of confidence . "
61974	61979	61967	61967	She	152	" I quite understand ! "
61993	62018	61980	61980	He	205	" Then I think there is nothing more we need trouble you with -- oh yes!--one thing -- Miss -- er -- Miss Priday-- ? "
62057	62064	62050	62051	The lawyer	1289	" Priday - Miss Priscilla Priday ? "
62065	62074	62076	62076	Priscilla	121	" Yes , sir -- that 's me , "
62080	62092	62093	62093	he	205	" Mr. Jocelyn thought very highly of you , Miss Friday , "
62094	62213	62050	62051	The lawyer	1289	said--"he mentions you in the following paragraph of his will--'I give and bequeath to my faithful housekeeper and good friend , Priscilla Priday , the sum of Two Hundred Pounds for her own personal use , and I desire that she shall remain at Briar Farm for the rest of her life . And that , if she shall find it necessary to resign her duties in the farm house , she shall possess that cottage on my estate known as Rose Cottage , free of all charges , and be allowed to live there and be suitably and comfortably maintained till the end of her days . And,--er -- pray do n't distress yourself , Miss Priday ! "
62228	62236	62237	62237	she	121	" Bless ' is old ' art ! "
62238	62399	62050	62051	The lawyer	1289	sobbed--"He thort of everybody , ' e did ! An ' what shall I ever want o ' Rose Cottage , as is the sweetest o ' little places , when I 've got the kitchen o ' Briar Farm!--an ' there I 'll ' ope to do my work plain an ' true till I drops!--so there!--an ' I 'm much obliged to ye , Mr. Bayliss , an ' mebbe ye'll tell me where to put the two ' underd pounds so as I do n't lose it , for I never ' ad so much money in my life , an ' if any one gets to ' ear of it I 'll ' ave all the ' alt an ' lame an ' blind round me in a jiffy . An ' as for keepin ' money , I never could -- an ' p'raps it ' ud be best for Mr. Robin to look arter it--- "
62412	62419	62421	62422	Mr. Bayliss	205	" It will be all right , "
62426	62451	62421	62422	Mr. Bayliss	205	" quite all right , I assure you ! Mr. Clifford will no doubt see to any little business matter for you with great pleasure-- "
62452	62454	62050	62051	The lawyer	1289	" Dear Priscilla!"--and
62466	62491	62050	62051	The lawyer	1289	neck--"Don't cry!--you will be so happy , living always in this dear old place!--and Robin will be so glad to have you with him . "
62505	62511	62512	62512	she	1301	" Ah , my lovey ! "
62514	62553	62492	62492	Priscilla	121	whispered--"I should be ' appy enough if I thought you was a - goin' to be ' appy too!--but you 're flyin ' in the face o ' fortune , lovey!--that 's what you 're a - doin' ! "
62576	62583	62584	62584	he	205	" I think , Mr. Clifford , "
62589	62712	62584	62584	he	205	last--"there is no occasion to trouble you further . Everything is in perfect order -- you are the inheritor of Briar Farm and all its contents , with all its adjoining lands -- and the only condition attached to your inheritance is that you keep it maintained on the same working methods by which it has always been maintained . You will find no difficulty in doing this -- and you have plenty of money to do it on . There are a few minor details respecting farm stock , etc . , which we can go over together at any time . You are sole executor , of course -- and -- and -- er -- yes!--I think that is all . "
62713	62719	62721	62721	Innocent	215	" May I go now ? "
62732	62739	62724	62724	her	215	face--"Do you want me any more ? "
62746	62757	62758	62758	he	205	" No -- I -- er -- I think not , "
62759	62768	62793	62793	he	205	replied--"Of course the pearls should be in your possession-- "
62769	62776	62777	62777	she	215	" I have given them away , "
62780	62783	62777	62777	she	215	quickly--"to Robin . "
62784	62792	62793	62793	he	205	" But I have not accepted them , "
62794	62805	62777	62777	she	215	answered--"I will keep them if you like -- for YOU . "
62847	62858	62859	62859	he	1289	" I 'm afraid she takes her loss rather badly , "
62860	62872	62777	62777	she	215	said--"or -- perhaps -- is she a little absent - minded ? "
62879	62884	62885	62885	he	1289	" I think not , "
62888	62919	62885	62885	he	1289	" Of course she feels the death of my uncle deeply -- she adored him -- and then - I - suppose you know -- my uncle may have told you-- "
62920	62931	62933	62934	Mr. Bayliss	205	" That he hoped and expected you to marry her ? "
62940	62968	62937	62937	his	205	sagaciously--"Yes -- I am aware that such was his dearest wish . In fact he led me to believe that the matter was as good as settled . "
62969	62976	62978	62978	Clifford	84	" She will not have me , "
62980	63001	62978	62978	Clifford	84	gently--"and I can not compel her to marry me against her will -- indeed I would not if I could . "
63020	63027	63028	63028	he	1289	" She will not have you ! "
63031	63059	63028	63028	he	1289	" Dear me ! That is indeed most unexpected and distressing ! There is -- there is nothing against you , surely?--you are quite a personable young man-- "
63067	63077	63078	63078	he	84	" Whatever I am does not matter to her , "
63079	63087	63101	63101	she	121	said--"Let us talk no more about it . "
63096	63100	63101	63101	she	121	" Eh well ! "
63102	63333	63101	63101	she	121	said--"If any one knows ' er at all ' tis I as ' ave ' ad ' er with me night an ' day when she was a baby -- and ' as watched ' er grow into the little beauty she is,--an ' ' er ' ed 's just fair full o ' strange fancies that she 's got out o ' the books she found in the old knight 's chest years ago -- we must give ' er time to think a bit an ' settle . ' Tis an awful blow to ' er to lose ' er Dad , as she allus called Farmer Jocelyn -- she 's like a little bird fallen out o ' the nest with no strength to use ' er wings an ' not knowin ' where to go . Let ' er settle a bit!--that 's what I sez -- an ' you 'll see I 'm right . You leave ' er alone , Mister Robin , an ' all'll come right , never fear ! She 's got the queerest notions about love -- she picked 'em out o ' they old books -- an ' she 'll ' ave to find out they 's more lies than truth . Love 's a poor ' oldin ' for most folks -- it do n't last long enough . "
63352	63364	63365	63365	he	205	" I 'm sure you 're quite right , Miss Priday ! "
63366	63396	63426	63426	his	1289	said--"you speak -- er -- most sensibly ! I 'm sure I hope , for the young lady 's sake , that she will ' settle down'--if she does not-- "
63397	63405	63407	63407	Clifford	84	" Ay , if she does not ! "
63409	63422	63426	63426	his	1289	" Well ! if she does not , life may be difficult for her"--and
63428	63471	63426	63426	his	1289	forebodingly--"A girl alone in the world -- with no relatives!--ah , dear , dear me ! A sad look - out!--a very sad look - out ! But we must trust to her good sense that she will be wise in time ! "
63621	64057	63601	63601	she	1307	" MY LITTLE WILDING!--When you read this I shall be gone to that wonderful world which all the clergymen tell us about , but which none of them are in any great hurry to see for themselves . I hope -- and I sometimes believe -- such a world exists -- and that perhaps it is a place where a man may sow seed and raise crops as well and as prosperously as on Briar Farm -- however , I 'm praying I may not be taken till I 've seen you safely we d to Robin -- and yet , something tells me this will not be ; and that 's the something that makes me write this letter and put it with the pearls that are , by my will , destined for you on your marriage - morning . I 'm writing it , remember , on the same night I 've told you all about yourself -- the night of the day the doctor gave me my death - warrant . I may live a year,--I may live but a week,--it will be hard if I may not live to see you married!--but God 's will must be done . The bank - notes folded in this letter make up four hundred pounds -- and this money you can spend as you like -- on your clothes for the bridal , or on anything you fancy -- I place no restriction on you as to its use . When a maid weds there are many pretties she needs to buy , and the prettier they are for you the better shall I be pleased . Whether I live or whether I die , you need say nothing of this money to Robin , or to anyone . It is your own absolutely -- to do as you like with . I am thankful to feel that you will be safe in Robin 's loving care -- for the world is hard on a woman left alone as you would be , were it not for him . I give you my word that if I had any clue , however small , to your real parentage , I would write down here for you all I know -- but I know nothing more than I have told you . I have loved you as my own child and you have been the joy of my old days . May God bless you and give you joy and peace in Briar Farm!--you and your children , and your children 's children ! Amen !

64289	64383	64263	64263	she	1310	said--"I can do what I like -- I have my wings , and I can fly away ! Oh Dad , dear Dad!--you would be so unhappy if you knew what I mean to do!--it would break your heart , Dad!--but you have no heart to break now , poor Dad!--it is cold as stone!--it will never beat any more ! Mine is the heart that beats!--the heart that burns , and aches , and hurts me!--ah!--how it hurts ! And no one can understand -- no one will ever care to understand ! "
64476	64484	64485	64485	she	1310	" I shall do for anything now , "
64486	64536	64544	64544	she	1310	said--"No one will look at me , and I shall pass quite unnoticed in a crowd . I 'm glad I 'm not a pretty girl -- it might be more difficult to get on . And Robin called me ' lovely ' the other day!--poor , foolish Robin ! "
64565	64568	64563	64563	she	121	" chores . "
64569	64574	64575	64575	she	1310	" No , lovey , "
64576	64637	64638	64638	Priscilla	121	said--"you just keep quiet , an ' by - an'-bye you an ' me'll ' ave a quiet tea together , for Mister Robin he 's gone off for the rest o ' the day an ' night with Mr. Bayliss , as there 's lots o ' things to see to , an ' ' e left you this little note"--here

"
64737	64809	64731	64731	Innocent	152	" I have made up my mind to go with Bayliss into the town and stay at his house for the night -- there are many business matters we have to go into together , and it is important for me to thoroughly understand the position of my uncle 's affairs . If I can not manage to get back to - morrow , I will let you know . Robin . "
64855	64863	64864	64864	she	152	" I 'll go into the garden , "
64865	64894	64844	64844	She	152	said--"and when it 's tea - time you 'll come and fetch me , wo n't you ? I shall be near the old stone knight , Sieur Amadis-- "

64934	64937	64943	64943	her	152	" Nothing ! "
64954	64972	64943	64943	her	152	again--"He never had anything to do with me , really ! But I seem to know him . "
65041	65059	65001	65001	Her	152	" If she winnot take Mister Robin , the Lord knows what 'll become of ' er ! "

It is the common lot of women -- why they should envy or desire it , I can not think ! To give one 's self up entirely to a man 's humours -- to be glad of his caresses , and miserable when he is angry or tired -- to bear his children and see them grow up and leave you for their own ' betterment ' as they would call it -- oh!--what an old , old drudging life!--a life of monotony , sickness , pain , and fatigue!--and nothing higher done than what animals can do ! There are plenty of women in the world who like to stay on this level , I suppose -- but I should not like it,--I could not live in this beautiful , wonderful world with no higher ambition than a sheep or a cow !

66070	66075	66076	66076	she	1328	" What is it ? "

66104	66108	66076	66076	she	1328	" There 's a lady"--she
66110	66144	66145	66145	Priscilla	121	gasped--"a lady to see you -- from London -- in the best parlour -- she asked for Farmer Jocelyn 's adopted daughter named Innocent . And she gave me her card -- here it is"--and
66159	66162	66076	66076	she	1328	" Lady Maude Blythe,"--then
66169	66179	66076	66076	she	1328	" Who can she be?--some one who knew Dad-- ? "
66180	66193	66195	66195	Priscilla	121	" Bless you , child , he never knew lord nor lady ! "
66200	66246	66076	66076	she	1328	somewhat--"No -- it 's more likely one o ' they grand folks what likes to buy old furniture , an ' mebbe somebody 's told ' er about Briar Farm things , an ' ' ow they might p'raps be sold now the master 's gone-- "
66247	66258	66260	66260	Innocent	152	" But that would be very silly and wicked talk , "
66262	66273	66260	66260	Innocent	152	" Nothing will be sold -- Robin would never allow it-- "
66274	66284	66286	66286	Priscilla	121	" Well , come an ' see the lady , "
66289	66354	66260	66260	Innocent	152	along--"She said she wished to see you partikler .

66531	66537	66538	66538	she	1334	" So you are Innocent ! "
66556	66559	66560	66560	she	414	" Yes , "
66563	66573	66560	66560	she	414	simply--"I am Innocent . You wished to see me-- ? "

66752	66775	66865	66866	Lady Blythe	224	continued--"Deaths and funerals are such unpleasant affairs ! But the farmer -- Mr. Jocelyn -- was not your father , was he ? "
66791	66792	66793	66794	the girl	414	" No,"--and
66798	66810	66793	66794	the girl	414	wonderingly--"but he was better than my own father who deserted me ! "
66811	66826	66828	66829	Lady Blythe	224	" Dear me ! Your own father deserted you ! How shocking of him ! "
66844	66848	66828	66829	Lady Blythe	224	her--"And your mother ? "
66849	66856	66865	66866	Lady Blythe	224	" She deserted me , too . "
66857	66863	66828	66829	Lady Blythe	224	" What a reprehensible couple ! "
66875	66885	66865	66866	Lady Blythe	224	" Come here and let me look at you ! "
66890	66894	66895	66895	she	152	" Excuse me , "
66903	66925	66895	66895	she	152	dignity--"I do not know you . I can not understand why you have come to see me -- if you would explain-- "

66957	66992	66953	66953	she	152	smiled--"Quite proud ! I suppose I really must explain ! Only I do hope you will not make a scene . Nothing is so unpleasant ! And SUCH bad form ! Please sit down ! "
67038	67123	67036	67036	she	152	" Well , I must first tell you that I have always known your history -- such a romance , is n't it ! You were brought here as a baby by a man on horseback'--and he left you with the good old farmer who has taken care of you ever since . I am right ? Yes!--I'm quite sure about it -- because I knew the man -- the curious sort of parental Lochinvar!--who got rid of you in such a curious way ! "
67130	67135	67036	67036	she	152	" You knew him ? "
67144	67226	67136	67137	Lady Blythe	224	" Yes -- I knew him -- rather well ! I was quite a girl -- and he was an artist -- a rather famous one in his way -- half French -- and very good - looking . Yes , he certainly was remarkably good - looking ! We ran away together -- most absurd of us -- but we did . Please do n't look at me like that!--you remind me of Sara Bernhardt in ' La Tosca ' ! "
67259	67275	67277	67278	Lady Blythe	224	" People often do that kind of thing -- fall in love and run away , "
67280	67400	67277	67278	Lady Blythe	224	placidly--"when they are young and silly . It is quite a delightful sensation , of course , but it does n't last . They do n't know the world -- and they never calculate results . However , we had quite a good time together . We went to Devon and Cornwall , and he painted pictures and made love to me -- and it was all very nice and pretty . Then , of course , trouble came , and we had to get out of it as best we could -- we were both tired of each other and quarrelled dreadfully , so we decided to give each other up . Only you were in the way ! "
67413	67416	67417	67417	she	152	" I ! "
67429	67474	67595	67596	Lady Blythe	224	" Yes -- you ! Dear me,--how you stare ! Do n't you understand ? I suppose you 've lived such a strange sort of hermit life down here that you know nothing . You were in the way -- you , the baby ! "
67475	67480	67595	67596	Lady Blythe	224	" Do you mean-- ? "
67481	67559	67595	67596	Lady Blythe	224	" Yes -- I mean what you ought to have guessed at once -- if you were not as stupid as an owl ! I 've told you I ran away with a man -- I would n't marry him , though he asked me to -- I should have been tied up for life , and I did n't want that -- so we decided to separate . And he undertook to get rid of the baby-- "
67560	67563	67565	67565	Innocent	152	" Me ! "
67567	67576	67565	67565	Innocent	152	wildly--"oh , dear God ! It was me ! "
67577	67593	67595	67596	Lady Blythe	224	" Yes -- it was you -- but you need n't be tragic about it ! "
67598	67617	67595	67596	Lady Blythe	224	calmly--"I think , on the whole , you were fortunately placed -- and I was told where you were-- "
67618	67637	67565	67565	Innocent	152	" You were told?--oh , you were told!--and you never came ! And you -- you are -- my MOTHER!"--and
67673	67679	67680	67680	she	224	" What a tiresome creature ! "
67685	67716	67684	67684	her	224	breath--"Quite undisciplined ! No repose of manner -- no style whatever ! And apparently very little sense ! I think it 's a pity I came,--a mistaken sense of duty ! "
67720	67867	67718	67718	she	224	" I hope you 're not going to cry very long ! Wo n't you get it over ? I thought you would be glad to know me -- and I 've come out of pure kindness to you , simply because I heard your old farmer was dead . Why Pierce Armitage should have brought you to him I never could imagine -- except that once he was painting a picture in the neighbourhood and was rather taken with the history of this place -- Briar Farm is n't it called ? You 'll make your eyes quite sore if you go on crying like that ! Yes -- I am your mother -- most unfortunately!--I hoped you would never know it!--but now -- as you are left quite alone in the world , I have come to see what I can do for you . "
67895	67903	67904	67904	she	152	" You can do nothing for me , "
67910	67930	67982	67983	Lady Blythe	224	voice--"You never have done anything for me . If you are my mother , you are an unnatural one ! "
67954	67981	67940	67940	she	152	" I was in your way at my birth -- and you were glad to be rid of me . Why should you seek me now ? "
67989	68000	68001	68001	she	152	" Really , you would do well on the stage ! "
68002	68169	67982	67983	Lady Blythe	224	said--"If you were taller , you would make your fortune with that tragic manner ! It is quite wasted on me , I assure you ! I 've told you a very simple commonplace truth -- a thing that happens every day -- a silly couple run away together , madly in love , and deluded by the idea that love will last -- they get into trouble and have a child -- naturally , as they are not married , the child is in the way , and they get rid of it -- some people would have killed it , you know ! Your father was quite a kind - hearted person -- and his one idea was to place you where there were no other children , and where you would have a chance of being taken care of . So he brought you to Briar Farm -- and he told me where he had left you before he went away and died . "
68170	68173	68175	68177	the girl--"My father	4028	" Died ! "
68176	68181	68175	68177	the girl--"My father	4028	girl--"My father is dead ? "
68182	68185	68186	68187	Lady Blythe	224	" So I believe,"--and
68191	68254	68186	68187	Lady Blythe	224	yawn--"He was always a rather reckless person -- went out to paint pictures in all weathers , or to ' study effects ' as he called it -- how I hated his ' art ' talk!--and I heard he died in Paris of influenza or pneumonia or something or other . But as I was married then , it did n't matter . "
68265	68267	68285	68286	Lady Blythe	224	" mother "
68272	68279	68280	68280	she	152	" Did you not love him ? "
68291	68379	68285	68286	Lady Blythe	224	" You odd girl ! Of course I was quite crazy about him!--he was so handsome -- and very fascinating in his way -- but he could be a terrible bore , and he had a very bad temper . I was thankful when we separated . But I have made my own private enquiries about you , from time to time -- I always had rather a curiosity about you , as I have had no other children . Wo n't you come and kiss me ? "
68384	68389	68390	68390	she	152	" I can not ! "
68401	68406	68407	68407	she	224	" As you like ! "
68410	68415	68407	68407	she	224	airily--"I do n't mind ! "
68424	68431	68432	68432	she	224	" How can you ask me ! "
68439	68489	68432	68432	she	224	tones--"You who have let me grow up without any knowledge of you!--you who had no shame in leaving me here to live on the charity of a stranger!--you who never cared at all for the child you brought into the world!--can you imagine that I could care -- now ? "
68490	68495	68497	68498	Lady Blythe--"I'm	228	" Well , really , "
68498	68581	68583	68583	she	1343	Blythe--"I'm not sure that I have asked you to care ! I have simply come here to tell you that you are not entirely alone in the world , and that I , knowing myself to be your mother--(although it happened so long ago I can hardly believe I was ever such a fool!)--am willing to do something for you -- especially as I have no children by my second marriage . I will , in fact , ' adopt ' you ! "
68599	68613	68583	68583	she	1343	" Lord Blythe will be delighted -- he 's a kind old person ! "
68622	68638	68614	68614	Innocent	152	" Do you mean to say that you will own me?--name me?--acknowledge me as your daughter-- "
68639	68645	68647	68648	Lady Blythe	224	" Why , certainly not ! "
68656	68779	68647	68648	Lady Blythe	224	disdain--"What are you thinking of ? You are not legitimate -- and you really have no lawful name -- besides , I 'm not bound to do anything at all for you now you are old enough to earn your own living . But I 'm quite a good - natured woman,--and as I have said already I have no other children -- and I 'm willing to ' adopt ' you , bring you out in society , give you pretty clothes , and marry you well if I can . But to own that I ever made such an idiot of myself as to have you at all is a little too much to ask!--Lord Blythe would never forgive me ! "
68780	68794	68614	68614	Innocent	152	" So you would make me live a life of deception with you ! "
68796	68836	68837	68837	she	1344	Innocent--"You would make me pretend to be what I am not -- just as you pretend to be what you are not!--and yet you say I am your child ! Oh God , save me from such a mother ! Madam"--and
68843	68933	68837	68837	she	1344	accents--"you have lived all these years without children , save me whom you have ignored -- and I , though nameless and illegitimate , now ignore you ! I have no mother ! I would not own you any more than you would own me;--my shame in saying that such a woman is my mother would be greater than yours in saying that I am your child ! For the stigma of my birth is not my fault , but yours!--I am , as my father called me--'innocent ' ! "
68966	68974	68975	68975	she	224	" You are exceedingly rude and stupid , "
68976	69036	68955	68956	Lady Blythe	224	said--"You talk like a badly - trained actress ! And you are quite blind to your own interests . Now please remember that if you refuse the offer I make you , I shall never trouble about you again -- you will have to sink or swim -- and you can do nothing for yourself -- without even a name-- "
69037	69043	69045	69045	Innocent	152	" Have you never heard , "
69049	69060	69045	69045	Innocent	152	" that it is quite possible to MAKE a name ? "
69062	69064	68955	68956	Lady Blythe	224	" mother "
69079	69085	69086	69086	she	1345	" Have you never thought , "
69088	69097	69061	69063	Her " mother	4030	on--"even you , in your strange life of hypocrisy-- "
69098	69101	69103	69104	Lady Blythe--"How	231	" Hypocrisy ! "
69104	69112	69061	69063	Her " mother	4030	Blythe--"How dare you say such a thing ! "
69113	69120	69122	69123	the girl	414	" Of course it is hypocrisy , "
69125	69203	69122	69123	the girl	414	resolutely--"You are married to a man who knows nothing of your past life -- is not that hypocrisy ? You are a great lady , no doubt -- you have everything you want in this world , except children -- one child you had in me , and you let me be taken from you -- yet you would pretend to ' adopt ' me though you know I am your own ! Is not that hypocrisy ? "
69224	69229	69230	69230	she	224	" It is tact , "
69231	69272	69220	69220	she	224	said--"and good manners . Society lives by certain conventions , and we must be careful not to outrage them . In your own interests you should be glad to learn how to live suitably without offence to others around you . "
69283	69289	69290	69290	she	224	" I have done that , "
69291	69403	69220	69220	she	224	answered--"so far . I shall continue to do it . I do not want any help from you ! I would rather die than owe you anything ! Please understand this ! You say I am your daughter , and I suppose I must believe it -- but the knowledge brings me sorrow and shame . And I must work my way out of this sorrow and shame,--somehow ! I will do all I can to retrieve the damaged life you have given me . I never knew my mother was alive -- and now -- I wish to forget it ! If my father lived , I would go to him-- "
69404	69409	69411	69412	Lady Blythe	224	" Would you indeed ! "
69428	69472	69411	69412	Lady Blythe	224	flight--"I'm afraid you would hardly receive a parental welcome ! Fortunately for himself and for me , he is dead,--so you are quite untrammelled by any latent notions of filial duty . And you will never see me again after to - day ! "
69473	69474	69220	69220	she	224	" No?"--and
69504	69509	69510	69510	she	224	" Of course not ! "
69511	69542	69220	69220	she	224	said--"Do you think you , in your position of a mere farmer 's girl , are likely to meet me in the greater world ? You , without even a name-- "
69543	69552	69554	69555	the girl	414	" Would you have given me a name ? "
69559	69569	69220	69220	she	224	" Of course ! I should have invented one for you--
69570	69578	69580	69580	Innocent	152	" I can do that for myself , "
69582	69602	69580	69580	Innocent	152	quietly--"and so you are relieved from all trouble on my score . May I ask you to go now ? "
69609	69618	69619	69619	she	152	" Are you insolent , or only stupid ? "
69620	69682	69220	69220	she	224	asked--"Do you realise what it is that I have told you -- that I , Lady Blythe , wife of a peer , and moving in the highest ranks of society , am willing to take charge of you , feed you , clothe you , bring you out and marry you well ? Do you understand , and still refuse ? "
69683	69692	69619	69619	she	152	" I understand -- and I still refuse , "
69694	69749	69220	69220	she	224	Innocent--"I would accept , if you owned me as your daughter to your husband and to all the world -- but as your ' adopted ' child -- as a lie under your roof -- I refuse absolutely and entirely ! Are you astonished that I should wish to live truly instead of falsely ? "
69762	69776	69777	69777	she	224	" I begin to think it must have been all a bad dream ! "
69782	69857	69858	69858	She	224	softly--"My little affair with your father can not have really happened , and you can not really be my child ! I must consider it in that light ! I feel I have done my part in the matter by coming here to see you and talk to you and make what I consider a very kind and reasonable proposition -- you have refused it -- and there is no more to be said . "
69875	69911	69858	69858	She	224	" Will you show me the way out ? I left my motor - car on the high - road -- my chauffeur did not care to bring it down your rather muddy back lane . "
69955	69956	69989	69989	she	224	" mother!"--and
69981	69988	69989	69989	she	224	" You will not kiss me ? "
69990	69998	70005	70005	her	152	said--"Not even for your father 's sake ? "
70014	70016	70013	70013	her	414	" mother "
70050	70056	70057	70057	she	224	" There!--be a good girl ! "
70060	70128	70057	70057	she	224	" You have the most extraordinary high - flown notions , and I think they will lead you into trouble ! However , I 'll give you one more chance -- if at the end of this year you would like to come to me , my offer to you still holds good . After that -- well!--as you yourself said , you will have no mother ! "
70129	70136	70138	70138	Innocent	152	" I have never had one ! "
70143	70151	70138	70138	Innocent	152	accents--"And -- I shall never have one ! "
70172	70177	70178	70178	she	224	" What delightful flowers ! "
70196	70223	70178	70178	she	224	listening--"A perfect paradise ! No wonder Briar Farm is so famous ! It 's perfectly charming ! Is this the way ? Thanks ever so much ! "
70230	70270	70227	70227	Innocent	152	gate--"Let me see!--I go up the old by - road?--yes?--and the main road joins it at the summit?--No , pray do n't trouble to come with me -- I can find my car quite easily ! Good - bye ! "

70470	70479	70460	70460	she	152	" Yes , dear ? What is it ? "
70493	70499	70480	70480	Priscilla	121	" Has the lady gone ? "
70500	70503	70460	70460	she	152	" Yes . "
70504	70514	70480	70480	Priscilla	121	" What did she want with ye , dearie ? "
70515	70520	70522	70522	Innocent	152	" Nothing very much ! "
70529	70553	70522	70522	Innocent	152	smile--"Only just what you thought!--she wished to buy something from Briar Farm -- and I told her it was not to be sold ! "
70605	70610	70620	70620	she	152	" good - night , "
70736	70739	70718	70718	she	152	" Sieur Amadis "

70786	71002	70757	70757	she	152	ran--"I have left this beloved home . It is impossible for me to stay . Dad left me some money in bank - notes in that sealed letter -- so I want for nothing . Do not be anxious or unhappy -- but marry soon and forget me . I know you will always be good to Priscilla -- tell her I am not ungrateful to her for all her care of me . I love her dearly . But I am placed in the world unfortunately , and I must do something that will help me out of the shame of being a burden on others and an object of pity or contempt . If you will keep the old books Dad gave me , and still call them mine , you will be doing me a great kindness . And will you take care of Cupid?--he is quite a clever bird and knows his friends . He will come to you or Priscilla as easily as he comes to me . Good - bye , you dear , kind boy ! I love you very much , but not as you want me to love you,--and I should only make you miserable if I stayed here and married you . God bless you ! "

71258	71408	71253	71253	she	1363	" there is no way out of it . It is not as if I were anybody -- I am nobody ! I was never wanted in the world at all . I have no name . I have never been baptised . And though I know now that I have a mother , I feel that she is nothing to me . I can hardly believe she is my mother . She is a lady of fashion with a secret -- and _ I _ am the secret ! I ought to be put away and buried and forgotten!--that would be safest for her , and perhaps best for me ! But I should like to live long enough to make her wish she had been true to my father and had owned me as his child ! Ah , such dreams ! Will they ever come true ! "

79439	79487	79402	79403	Miss Leigh	239	" Yes -- I -- I think so -- he died abroad -- so they say , but I have never quite believed it -- I do n't know why ! Come , let me show you the rooms . I am glad your name is Armitage . "

79625	79674	79622	79622	she	239	" Now , at once ! I have only just arrived in London and this is the first place I have seen . It seems so -- so fortunate that you should have had a friend named Armitage ! Perhaps -- perhaps I may be a friend too ! "
79705	79711	79712	79712	she	239	" You may , indeed ! "
79715	79774	79694	79694	She	239	" One never can tell what may happen in this strange world ! But we have to be practical -- and I am very poor and pressed for money . I do not know you -- and of course I should expect references from some respectable person who can tell me who you are and all about you . "
79789	79798	79799	79799	she	239	" I can not give you any references , "
79800	79844	79845	79845	she	239	said--"I am quite alone in the world -- my people are dead -- you see I am in mourning . The last friend I had died a little while ago and left me four hundred pounds in bank - notes . I have them here"--and

79915	79953	79954	79954	she	239	" I would not on any account take so much money from you . If you wish to stay , and if I must omit references and take you on trust -- which I am quite willing to do!"--and
79957	79977	79954	79954	she	239	gravely--"I will accept two months ' rent in advance if you think you can spare this -- can you ? "

80228	80256	80225	80225	she	152	" this is my little fortune ! Please change one of them and take the two months ' rent and anything more you want -- please do ! "
80267	80275	80276	80276	she	152	" No , my dear , no ! "
80279	80376	80377	80377	she	152	" You must not tempt me ! I will take exactly the two months ' rent and no more ; but I think you ought not to carry this money about with you -- you should put it in a bank . We 'll talk of this afterwards -- but go and lock it up somewhere now -- there 's a little desk in your room you could use -- but a bank would be safest . After dinner this evening I 'll tell you what I think you ought to do -- you are so very young!"--and
80378	80395	80404	80404	her	152	smiled--"such a young little thing ! I shall have to look after you and play chaperone ! "
80407	80415	80416	80416	she	152	" That will be kind of you ! "
80454	80513	80434	80434	she	152	" In a little while I will tell you a great deal about myself -- and I do hope I shall please you ! I will not give any trouble , and I 'll try to be useful in the house if you 'll let me . I can cook and sew and do all sorts of things ! "
80514	80520	80522	80523	Miss Leigh	239	" Can you , indeed ! "

80549	80574	80546	80546	she	152	" But I shall do all my writing in the mornings -- in the afternoons I can help you as much as you like . "
80575	80586	80588	80589	Miss Leigh	239	" My dear , your time must be your own , "

81992	82112	81989	81989	he	84	" I could cry like a baby -- not for myself so much , but to think of her running away from Briar Farm out into the wide world all alone ! Little Innocent ! She was safe here -- and if she had wished it , _ I _ would have gone away -- I would have made HER the owner of the farm , and left her in peace to enjoy it and to marry any other man she fancied . But she would n't listen to any plan for her own happiness since she knew she was not my uncle 's daughter -- that is what has changed her ! I wish she had never known ! "
82113	82120	82122	82122	Priscilla	255	" Ay , so do I ! "

All about that old stone knight in the garden -- an ' what wi ' the things he 's left carved all over the wall of the room where she read them queer old books , she 's fair ' mazed with ideas that do n't belong to the ways o ' the world at all .

I ca n't think she 's gone far or that she 'll stay away long . Her heart 's in Briar Farm all the while -- I'd swear to that ! Why , only yesterday when a fine lady came to see if she could n't buy something out o ' the house , you should just a ' seen her toss her pretty little head when she told me how she 'd said it was n't to be sold .

I asked if it was anything I could do , and she said no . So I called the child in from the garden , and she and the lady had quite a long talk together in the best parlour . Then when the lady went away , Innocent told me that she had wished to buy something from Briar Farm -- but that it was not to be sold . "

82732	82746	82747	82747	he	126	" You do n't think she came to engage Innocent for some service ? "
82750	82778	82747	82747	he	126	" Or that Innocent herself had perhaps written to an agency asking for a place , and that this lady had come to see her in consequence ? "
82803	82809	82810	82810	she	1585	" It might be so , "
82815	82866	82810	82810	she	1585	" But I ca n't bear to think the child was playin ' a part an ' tellin ' me things that were n't true just to get away from us . No ! Mister Robin ! I do n't believe that lady had anything to do with her going . "
82867	82878	82879	82879	he	126	" Well , I shall keep the name by me , "
82882	82932	82879	82879	he	126	" And I shall find out where the lady lives , who she is and all about her . For if I do n't hear from Innocent , if she does n't write to us , I 'll search the whole world and never rest till I find her ! "

85820	86067	85819	85819	he	241	said--"Why on earth you should think that because a woman looks like a school - girl she can not write a clever book if gifted that way , is a condition of non - intelligence I fail to fathom ! You speak of this author as a ' he . ' Do you think only a male creature can produce a work of genius ? Look at the twaddle men turn out every day in the form of novels alone ! Many of them are worse than the worst weak fiction by women . I tell you I 've lived long enough to know that a woman 's brain can beat a man 's if she cares to test it , so long as she does not fall in love . When once that disaster happens it 's all over with her ! It 's the one drawback to a woman 's career ; if she would only keep clear of love and self - sacrifice she 'd do wonders ! Men never allow love to interfere with so much as their own smoke -- very few among them would sacrifice a good cigar for a woman ! As for this girl , Miss Armitage , I 'll pluck out the heart of her mystery for you ! I suppose you wo n't pay any less for good work if it turns out to be by a ' she ' instead of a ' he ' ? "
86073	86077	86078	86078	he	1637	" Certainly not ! "
86081	86119	86078	86078	he	1637	" We have already paid over a thousand pounds in royalties on the present book , and we have agreed to give two thousand in advance on the next . The author has expressed himself as perfectly satisfied-- "

86177	86241	86174	86175	the publisher	1637	distressed--"surely you do not intend to trouble this poor girl by questions concerning her employer ? It 's hardly fair to her!--and of course it 's only your way of joking , but your idea that she wrote the book we 're all talking about is simply absurd ! She could n't do it !

90635	90663	90628	90628	His	1739	" Indeed ? This is very interesting ! I thought I was the only wearer of such a very medieval appellation ! Is there another so endowed ? "
90664	90672	90676	90676	herself	1742	" There WAS another -- long , long ago"--and
90701	90875	90690	90690	her	1742	" He was a noble knight of France , and he came over to England with the Due d ' Anjou when the great Elizabeth was Queen . He fell in love with a very beautiful Court lady , who would not care for him at all,--so , as he was unhappy and broken - hearted , he went away from London and hid himself from everybody in the far country . There he bought an old manor - house and called it Briar Farm -- and he married a farmer 's daughter and settled in England for good -- and he had six sons and daughters . And when he died he was buried on his own land -- and his effigy is on his tomb -- it was sculptured by himself . I used to put flowers on it , just where his motto was carved--'Mon coeur me soutien . ' For I -- I was brought up at Briar Farm ... and I was quite fond of the Sieur Amadis ! "
91020	91033	91034	91034	he	1744	" A pity you should waste fondness on a man of stone ! "
91049	91084	91034	91034	he	1744	" But what you tell me is most curious , for your ' Sieur Amadis ' must be the missing branch of my own ancestral tree . May I explain?--or will it bore you ? "
91094	91098	91099	91099	she	1743	" Bore me ? "
91100	91115	91142	91142	he	1744	echoed--"How could it ? Oh , do please let me know everything -- quickly ! "
91122	91133	91134	91134	he	1744	" We 'll sit down here out of the crowd , "
91165	91182	91142	91142	he	1744	" You have told me half a romance ! Perhaps I can supply the other half . "
91214	91399	91206	91206	her	1743	" Long , long ago -- as you put it -- in the days of good Queen Bess , there lived a certain Hugo de Jocelin , a nobleman of France , famed for fierce deeds of arms , and for making himself generally disagreeable to his neighbours with whom he was for ever at cross - purposes . This contentious personage had two sons,--Jeffrey and Amadis,--also knights - at - arms , inheriting the somewhat excitable nature of their father ; and the younger of these , Amadis , whose name I bear , was selected by the Duc d'Anjou to accompany him with his train of nobles and gentles , when that ' petit grenouille ' as he called himself , went to England to seek Queen Elizabeth 's hand in marriage . The Duke failed in his ambitious quest , as we all know , and many of his attendants got scattered and dispersed,--among them Amadis , who was entirely lost sight of , and never returned again to the home of his fathers . He was therefore supposed to be dead-- "
91400	91404	91406	91406	Innocent	152	" MY Amadis ! "
91417	91421	91423	91423	his	1750	" YOUR Amadis!--yes ! "
91427	91510	91511	91511	he	1750	" Of course he must have been YOUR Amadis!--your ' Knight of old and warrior bold ! ' Well ! None of his own people ever heard of him again -- and in the family tree he is marked as missing . But Jeffrey stayed at home in France,--and in due course inherited his father 's grim old castle and lands . He married , and had a large family,--much larger than the six olive - branches allotted to your friend of Briar Farm,"--and
91514	91548	91511	91511	he	1750	" He , Jeffrey , is my ancestor , and I can trace myself back to him in direct lineage , so you see I have quite the right to my curious name ! "
91569	91574	91575	91575	she	1751	" It is wonderful ! "
91576	91600	91549	91549	She	1751	murmured--"I can hardly believe it possible that I should meet here in London a real Jocelyn!--one of the family of the Sieur Amadis ! "
91601	91607	91608	91608	He	1750	" Does it seem strange ? "
91611	91683	91608	91608	He	1750	" Oh no ! Nothing is strange in this queer little world ! But I do n't quite know what the exact connection is between me and your knight -- it 's too difficult for me to grasp ! I suppose I 'm a sort of great - great - great - grand - nephew ! However , nothing can alter the fact that I am also an Amadis de Jocelyn ! "
91691	91697	91698	91698	she	1751	" You are , indeed ! "
91701	91715	91684	91684	She	1751	" It is you who ought to be the master of Briar Farm ! "
91716	91720	91721	91721	He	1750	" Ought I ? "
91728	91731	91721	91721	He	1750	" Why ? "
91732	91745	91746	91746	she	1751	" Because there is no direct heir now to the Sieur Amadis ! "
91752	91816	91746	91746	she	1751	" His last descendant is dead . His name was Hugo -- Hugo Jocelyn -- and he was a farmer , and he left all he had to his nephew , the only child of his sister who died before him . The nephew is very good , and clever , too,--he was educated at Oxford,--but he is not an actually lineal descendant . "
91834	91840	91841	91841	he	1752	" That 's very terrible ! "
91844	91936	91841	91841	he	1752	" I do n't know when I 've heard anything so lamentable ! And I 'm afraid I ca n't put matters right ! I should never do for a farmer -- I'm a painter . I had better go down and see this famous old place , and the tomb of my ever so great - great - grand - uncle ! I could make a picture of it -- I ought to do that , as it belonged to the family of my ancestors . Will you take me ? "
91947	91956	91957	91957	she	1754	" You are making fun of it all , "
91960	91978	91957	91957	she	1754	" That is not wise of you ! You should not laugh at grave and noble things . "
91986	91996	91997	91997	he	1755	" Was he grave and noble?--Amadis , I mean ? "
92011	92046	91997	91997	he	1755	" You are sure ? Well , all honour to him ! And to YOU -- for believing in him ! I hope you 'll consider me kindly for his sake ! Will you ? "
92054	92061	92062	92062	she	1754	" Of course!--I must do so ! "
92067	92073	92062	92062	she	1754	" I owe him so much-- "
92086	92103	92062	92062	she	1754	hesitated--"I mean -- he taught me all I know . I studied all his old books .... "
92112	92147	92106	92108	their cheery host	1757	" Well ! Have you made friends ? Ah!--I see you have ! Mutual intelligence , mutual comprehension ! Jocelyn , will you bring Miss Innocent in to supper?--I leave her in your charge . "
92148	92152	92154	92154	Jocelyn	143	" Miss Innocent ? "
92171	92194	92106	92108	their cheery host	1757	" Yes -- some people call her Ena -- but her real name is Innocent . Is n't it , little lady ? "
92209	92217	92218	92218	he	143	" Really ? Your name is Innocent ? "
92221	92224	92225	92225	she	1757	" Yes , "

I 've had a fairly hard time , and I 've experienced the rough side of human nature , getting more kicks than halfpence . Now that the kicks have ceased I 'm in no mood for soft soap . I know the humbug of so - called ' friendship'--the rarity of sincerity -- and as for love!--there 's no such thing permanently in man , woman or child . What is called ' love ' is merely a comfortable consciousness that one particular person is agreeable and useful to you for a time -- but it 's only for a time -- and marriage which seeks to bind two people together till death is the heaviest curse ever imposed on manhood or womanhood ! Devotion and self - sacrifice are merest folly -- the people you sacrifice yourself for are never worth it , and devotion is generally , if not always , misplaced . The only thing to do in this life is to look after yourself,--serve yourself -- please yourself ! No one will do anything for you unless they can get something out of it for their own advantage,--you're bound to follow the general example ! "

We consider that women were made to charm and to amuse us -- not to equal us . Do you see ? When a woman is clever -- perhaps cleverer than we are -- she ceases to be amusing -- and we must be amused ! We can not have our fun spoiled by the blue - stocking element,--though you -- YOU do not look in the least ' blue ' ! "

I can hardly believe that the dear little ' Innocent ' of Briar Farm has become such a celebrated and much - talked - of personage , for after all it is not yet two years since you left us . I have told Priscilla , and she sends her love and duty , and hopes God will allow her to see you once again before she dies . The work of the farm goes on as usual , and everything prospers -- all is as Uncle Hugo would have wished -- all except one thing which I know will never be ! But you must not think I grumble at my fate . I might feel lonely if I had not plenty of work to do and people dependent on me -- but under such circumstances I manage to live a life that is at least useful to others and I want for nothing . In the evenings when the darkness closes in , and we light the tall candles in the old pewter sconces , I often wish I could see a little fair head shining like a cameo against the dark oak panelling -- a vision of grace and hope and comfort!--but as this can not be , I read old books -- even some of those belonging to your favourite French Knight Amadis!--and try to add to the little learning I gained at Oxford . I am sending for your book!--when it comes I shall read every word of it with an interest too deep to be expressed to you in my poor language . ' Cupid ' is well -- he flies to my hand , surprised , I think , to find it of so rough a texture as compared with the little rose - velvet palm to which he was accustomed . Will you ever come to Briar Farm again ? God bless you ! ROBIN . "

She used to shut herself up all the morning and write -- she told me she was finishing off some work -- in fact it was her first book,--a manuscript she brought with her from the country in that famous satchel ! I knew nothing at all about it till she confided to me one day that she had written a book , and that it had been accepted by a publisher . I was amazed ! "
96377	96388	96220	96220	he	84	" And the result must have amazed you still more , "
96390	96426	96220	96220	he	84	Harrington,--"but I 'm a very astute person!--and I guessed at once , when I was told the address of the ' PRIVATE SECRETARY of the author , ' that the SECRETARY was the author herself ! "

96446	96467	96443	96443	she	152	" but really I WAS and AM the secretary of the author!--I write all the manuscript with my own hand ! "
96480	96594	96475	96475	Harrington	241	" I believe you know the painter Amadis Jocelyn , do n't you ? Yes ? Well , I was with him the other day , and I said you were the author of the wonderful book . He told me I was talking nonsense -- that you could n't be,--he had met you at an artist 's evening party and that you had told him a story about some ancestor of his own family . ' She 's a nice little thing with baby eyes , ' he said , ' but she could n't write a clever book ! She may have got some man to write it for her ! ' "
96603	96609	96475	96475	Harrington	241	" Oh!--did he say that ? "
96610	96733	96475	96475	Harrington	241	" Of course he did ! All men say that sort of thing ! They ca n't bear a woman to do more than marry and have children . Simple girl with the satchel , do n't you know that ? You must n't mind it -- it 's their way . Of course I rounded on Jocelyn and told him he was a fool , with a swelled head on the subject of his own sex -- he IS a fool in many ways,--he 's a great painter , but he might be much greater if he 'd get up early in the morning and stick to his work . He ought to have been in the front rank long ago . "
96734	96744	96746	96747	Miss Leigh	239	" But surely he IS in the front rank ? "
96749	96755	96746	96747	Miss Leigh	239	mildly--"He is a wonderful artist ! "
96756	96773	96775	96775	Harrington	241	" Wonderful -- yes!--with a lot of wonderful things in him which have n't come out ! "
96777	96843	96775	96775	Harrington	241	" and which never will come out , I fear ! He turns night into day too often . Oh , he 's clever!--I grant you all that -- but he has n't a resolute will or a great mind , like Watts or Burne - Jones or any of the fellows who served their art nobly -- he 's a selfish sort of chap !

96964	96987	97003	97003	Harrington	241	said--"Upon my word , it 's a quaint bit of history and coincidence -- almost too romantic for such days as these ! "

97009	97089	97003	97003	Harrington	241	" Almost ! It 's gasping its last gasp in company with poetry . Realism is our only wear -- Realism and Prose -- very prosy Prose . YOU are a romantic child!--I can see that!--but do n't over - do it ! And if you ever made an ideal out of your sixteenth - century man , do n't make another out of the twentieth - century one !

98081	98086	98088	98089	the girl	414	" Who would not ! "
98094	98107	98109	98111	the old lady	1525	" And she lives it -- very much so!--rather to the dregs ! "
98116	98165	98109	98111	the old lady	1525	" She has no real aim beyond the satisfaction of her own vanity and social power -- and you , with your beautiful thoughts and ideals , might not like the kind of people she surrounds herself with -- people , who only want amusement and ' sensation'--particularly sensation-- "
98182	98210	98176	98176	she	152	" To go or not to go , godmother mine ! Which is it to be ? The decision rests with you ! Yes , or no ? "

98232	98262	98229	98229	her	239	" It would be unwise to refuse -- especially just now when everyone is talking of you and wishing to see you . And you are quite worth seeing ! "

98344	98355	98356	98356	Innocent	152	thought--"But not happier , I fear!--not happier , poor child ! "

98411	98567	98356	98356	Innocent	152	ran--"I hope you will go -- for the purely selfish reason that I want to meet you there . Hers is a great house with plenty of room , and a fine garden -- for London . People crowd to her ' crushes ' , but one can always escape the mob . I have seen so little of you lately , and you are now so famous that I shall think myself lucky if I may touch the hem of your garment . Will you encourage me thus far ? Like Hamlet , ' I lack advancement ' ! When will you take me to Briar Farm ? I should like to see the tomb of my very ancestral uncle -- could we not arrange a day 's outing in the country while the weather is fine ? I throw myself on your consideration and clemency for this -- and for many other unwritten things !

101013	101065	100997	100997	her	224	" Oh , I could strike you for your insolence ! I wish I had never sought you out or told you how you were born ! Is this your revenge for the manner of your birth , that you come to shame me among my own class -- my own people-- "
101080	101084	101085	101085	she	152	" Shame you ? "
101088	101166	101167	101167	Her	1938	" I ? What shame have I brought you ? What shame shall I bring ? Had you owned me as your child I would have made you proud of me ! I would have given you honour,--you abandoned me to strangers , and I have made honour for myself ! Shame is YOURS and yours only!--it would be mine if I had to acknowledge YOU as my mother!--you who never had the courage to be true ! "
101172	101236	101167	101167	Her	1938	passion.--"I have won my own way ! I am something beyond and above you!--'your own class -- your own people , ' as you call them , are at MY feet,--and you -- you who played with my father 's heart and spoilt his career -- you have lived to know that I , his deserted child , have made his name famous ! "
101250	101257	101258	101258	she	224	" His name -- his name ! "
101263	101282	101258	101258	she	224	" Yes , and how dare you take it ? You have no right to it in law ! "

101297	101387	101388	101388	she	224	" Would you rather I had taken yours ? I might have done so had I known it -- though I think not , as I should have been ashamed of any ' maiden ' name you had dishonoured ! When you came to Briar Farm to find me -- to see me -- so late , so late!--after long years of desertion -- I told you it was possible to make a name;--one can not go nameless through the world ! I have made mine!--independently and honestly -- in fact"--and
101394	101411	101388	101388	she	224	smile--"it is an honour for you , my mother , to know me , your daughter ! "
101444	101452	101453	101453	she	224	" What do you mean to do ? "
101461	101487	101453	101453	she	224	" I must know ! What are your plans of vengeance?--your campaign of notoriety?--your scheme of self - advertisement ? What claim will you make ? "
101488	101491	101493	101493	Innocent	152	" None ! "
101505	101592	101493	101493	Innocent	152	" I have no claim upon you , thank God ! I am less to you than a dropped lamb , lost in a thicket of thorns , is to the sheep that bore it ! That 's a rough country simile,--I was brought up on a farm , you know!--but it will serve your case . Think nothing of me , as I think nothing of you ! What I am , or what I may be to the world , is my own affair ! "
101609	101633	101599	101600	Lady Blythe	224	" Then , when we meet in society , as we have met to - night , it will be as comparative strangers ? "
101634	101644	101645	101646	the girl	414	" Why , of course!--we have always been strangers , "
101651	101664	101645	101646	the girl	414	" No strangers were ever more strange to each other than we ! "
101665	101675	101599	101600	Lady Blythe	224	" You mean to keep MY secret?--and your own ? "
101676	101692	101645	101646	the girl	414	" Certainly . Do you suppose I would give my father 's name to slander ? "
101693	101713	101599	101600	Lady Blythe	224	" Your father!--you talk of your father as if HE was worth consideration!--he was chiefly to blame for your position-- "
101714	101726	101728	101728	Innocent	152	" Was he ? I am not quite sure of that , "
101730	101767	101728	101728	Innocent	152	slowly--"I do not know all the circumstances . But I have heard that he was a great artist ; and that some woman he loved ruined his life . And I believe you are that woman ! "
101777	101783	101784	101784	she	224	" Believe what you like ! "
101785	101861	101862	101862	She	224	said--"You are an imaginative little fool ! When you know more of the world you will find out that men ruin women 's lives as casually as cracking nuts , but they take jolly good care of their own skins ! Pierce Armitage was too selfish a man to sacrifice his own pleasure and comfort for anyone -- he was glad to get rid of me -- and of YOU ! And now -- now ! "
101876	101931	101932	101932	She	224	" Now you are famous!--actually famous ! Good heavens!--why , I thought you would stay in that old farmhouse all your life , scrubbing the floors and looking after the poultry , and perhaps marrying some good - natured country yokel ! Famous!--you!--with social London dancing attendance on you ! What a ghastly comedy ! "
101936	101945	101932	101932	She	224	" Come!--we must go back to the house . "

102077	102083	102084	102084	she	224	" How guilty I feel ! "
102087	102137	102084	102084	she	224	" Everybody wanting to see you , and I selfishly detaining you in the garden ! It was so good of you to give me a few minutes!--you , the guest of the evening too ! Good - night!--in case I do n't find you again in this crowd ! "
102189	102198	102200	102201	Lord Blythe	229	" I 'm afraid you 've caught cold ! "
102203	102240	102200	102201	Lord Blythe	229	kindly--"That will never do ! I promised I would take you to the Duchess as soon as I found you -- she has some friends with her who wish to meet you . Will you come ? "
102311	102324	102325	102325	he	229	" They 're going to dance in the ball - room directly , "
102339	102353	102329	102329	he	229	" You will not be without partners ! Are you fond of dancing ? "
102373	102429	102354	102354	Her	224	" Yes , I like it very much , though before I came to London I only knew country dances such as they dance at harvest - homes ; but of course here , you all dance so differently!--it is only just going round and round ! But it 's quite pleasant and rather amusing . "
102430	102440	102441	102441	he	229	" You were brought up in the country then ? "
102444	102458	102354	102354	Her	224	" Yes , entirely . I came to London about two years ago . "
102459	102476	102354	102354	Her	224	" But -- I hope you do n't think me too inquisitive!--where did you study literature ? "
102482	102493	102494	102494	she	224	" I do n't think I studied it at all , "
102497	102581	102494	102494	she	224	" I just loved it ! There was a small library of very old books in the farmhouse where I lived , and I read and re - read these . Then , when I was about sixteen , it suddenly came into my head that I would try to write a story myself -- and I did . Little by little it grew into a book , and I brought it to London and finished it here . You know the rest ! "
102582	102595	102597	102598	Lord Blythe	229	" Like Byron , you awoke one morning to find yourself famous ! "
102602	102609	102597	102598	Lord Blythe	229	" You have no parents living ? "
102621	102624	102494	102494	she	224	" No . "
102625	102643	102610	102610	Her	1955	" A pity ! They would have been very proud of you . Here is the Duchess ! "

102753	102884	102746	102746	she	1955	" These prodigies and things ! I love them ! They 're often quite ugly and have rude manners -- Beethoven used to eat with his fingers I believe ; was n't it wonderful of him ! Such a relief from the conventional way ! When I was quite a girl I used to adore a man in Paris who played the ' cello divinely -- a perfect marvel!--but he would n't comb his hair or blow his nose properly -- and it was n't very nice!--not that it mattered much , he was such a wonderful artist ! Oh yes , I know ! it would n't have lessened his genius to have wiped his nose with a handkerchief instead of-- ! well!--perhaps we 'd better not mention it ! "
102894	102900	102886	102886	she	1964	" These deaf abnormal people ! "

103100	103108	103110	103111	the Duchess	4640	" How late you are , Amadis ! "
103135	103179	103115	103115	she	4640	" If you mean Miss Armitage , she is just over there talking to two old fogies . I think they 're Cabinet ministers -- they look it ! She 's quite the success of the evening,--and pretty , do n't you think ? "
103204	103208	103209	103209	he	1969	" Not exactly , "
103212	103252	103209	103209	he	1969	" But spirituelle -- she has what some painters might call an imaginative head -- she could pose very well for St. Dorothy . I can quite realise her preferring the executioner 's axe to the embraces of Theophilus . "
103271	103281	103282	103282	she	4640	" Are you going to make love to her ? "
103285	103303	103282	103282	she	4640	" You make love to every woman -- but most women understand your sort of love - making-- "

103316	103325	103310	103310	his	1969	" And what do they think of it ? "
103326	103332	103333	103333	she	4640	" They laugh at it ! "
103338	103355	103333	103333	she	4640	" But that clever child would not laugh -- she would take it au grand serieux . "
103378	103515	103356	103356	He	1969	" Would she ? My dear Duchess , nobody takes anything ' au grand serieux ' nowadays . We grin through every scene of life , and we do n't know and do n't care whether it 's comedy or tragedy we 're grinning at ! It does n't do to be serious . I never am . ' Life is real , life is earnest ' was the line of conduct practised by my French ancestors ; they cut up all their enemies with long swords , and then sat down to wild boar roasted whole for dinner . That was real life , earnest life ! We in our day do n't cut up our enemies with long swords -- we cut them up in the daily press . It 's so much easier ! "
103516	103525	103527	103528	the Duchess	4640	" How you love to hear yourself talk ! "
103530	103548	103527	103528	the Duchess	4640	" I let you do it -- but I know you do n't mean half you say ! "
103549	103581	103356	103356	He	1969	" You think not ? Well , I 'm going to join the court of Corinne -- she 's not the usual type of Corinne -- I fancy she has a heart-- "
103582	103596	103598	103599	the Duchess	4640	" And you want to steal it if you can , of course ! "
103602	103620	103598	103599	the Duchess	4640	" Men always long for what they have n't got , and tire of what they have ! "
103621	103647	103356	103356	He	1969	" True , O Queen ! We are made so ! Blame , not us , but the Creator of the poor world - mannikins ! "
103668	103676	103677	103677	she	4640	" I thought you were never coming ! "
103682	103691	103677	103677	she	4640	" I 'm so glad you are here ! "

103774	103784	103757	103769	Several of the younger men in the group which had gathered about her	1974	" Give somebody else a chance , Miss Armitage ! "
103793	103807	103785	103785	She	4640	" But of course ! Mr. Amadis de Jocelyn has not taken all ? "
103812	103821	103808	103808	They	1974	" His name dominates your programme , anyhow ! "
103827	103834	103835	103835	she	4640	" It is a beautiful name ! "
103838	103851	103853	103856	one man near her	1976	" Granted ! But show a little mercy to the unbeautiful names ! "
103858	103873	103853	103856	one man near her	1976	" My name , for instance , is Smith -- can you tolerate it ? "
103882	103888	103889	103889	she	4640	" You play with me ! "
103890	103908	103874	103874	She	4640	said--"Of course ! You will find a dance , Mr. Smith!--and I will dance it with you ! "
103944	103953	103954	103954	she	4640	" But I shall never dance all these ! "
103957	103968	103970	103970	Jocelyn	102	" No , you will sit out some of them , "
103972	103975	103970	103970	Jocelyn	102	coolly--"With me ! "
104012	104019	104020	104020	he	1977	" We 'll begin the revelry ! "

104152	104182	104149	104149	he	1977	" It 's quite a real garden for London -- and I know every inch of it . We 'll find a quiet corner and sit down and rest . "
104228	104236	104237	104237	he	1977	" You must n't catch a chill , "
104241	104272	104237	104237	he	1977	" But it 's not a cold night -- in fact it 's very close and sultry -- almost like thunder . A little air will be good for us . "

105525	105567	105568	105568	Her	4640	answered--"Not even that -- sweet soul as you are!--not even that ! You think I am -- but you do not know . You are a clever , imaginative little girl -- and I love to hear you praise me -- but-- "
105576	105582	105583	105583	she	4640	" No ' buts ! ' "

106971	107011	106968	106968	she	239	" You are young and ought to enjoy yourself . I am old , and hardly fit for these late assemblies -- and how very late they are too ! When I was a girl we never stayed beyond midnight-- "

107278	107286	107268	107268	her	2032	" I have been so very happy ! "
107306	107316	107268	107268	her	2032	" Good - night , ' Sieur Amadis ! ' "

107354	107363	107365	107366	Miss Leigh	239	" You are tired , child!--you must be ! "
107368	107389	107399	107400	Miss Leigh	239	" No , godmother mine ! That sigh was one of pleasure . It has been a most wonderful evening!--wonderful ! "
107390	107397	107399	107400	Miss Leigh	239	" It was certainly very brilliant , "
107402	107438	107399	107400	Miss Leigh	239	" And I 'm glad you were made so much of , my dear ! That was as it ought to be . Lord Blythe told me he had seldom met so charming a girl ! "
107444	107453	107439	107439	Innocent	152	" Lord Blythe ? Do you know him ? "
107454	107466	107468	107469	Miss Leigh	239	" No , I can not say I really know him , "
107471	107550	107468	107469	Miss Leigh	239	" I 've met him several times -- and his wife too -- there was some scandal about her years and years ago before she was married -- nobody ever knew exactly what it was , and her people hushed it up . I daresay it was n't very much . Anyhow Lord Blythe married her -- and he 's a very fine man with a great position . I thought I saw you talking to Lady Blythe ? "
107551	107552	107439	107439	Innocent	152	" Yes"--Innocent
107555	107565	107468	107469	Miss Leigh	239	mechanically--"I had a few minutes ' conversation with her . "
107566	107572	107575	107576	Miss Leigh	239	" She 's very handsome , "
107578	107593	107575	107576	Miss Leigh	239	" She used to be quite beautiful . A pity she has no children . "
107605	107618	107620	107622	the old lady	1525	" You and Mr. Jocelyn seem to get on very well together , "
107626	107645	107620	107622	the old lady	1525	" He is a very ' taking ' man -- but I wonder if he is quite sincere ? "
107665	107672	107673	107673	she	1525	" Why should he not be ? "
107674	107689	107620	107622	the old lady	1525	asked--"Surely with his great art , he would be more sincere than most men ? "
107690	107697	107699	107700	Miss Leigh	239	" Well , I hope so ! "
107708	107780	107781	107781	she	1525	" But artists are very impressionable , and live so much in a world of their own that I sometimes doubt whether they have much understanding or sympathy with the world of other people ! Even Pierce Armitage -- who was very dear to me -- ran away with impressions like a child with toys . He would adore a person one day -- and hate him , or her , the next!"--and
107785	107812	107781	107781	she	1525	compassionately--"He would indeed , poor fellow ! He was rather like Shelley in his likes and dislikes -- you've read all about your Shelley of course ? "
107813	107818	107819	107820	the girl	414	" Indeed I have ! "
107821	107833	107781	107781	she	1525	answered,--"A glorious poet!--but he must have been difficult to live with ! "
107834	107839	107840	107843	the gentle old lady	1553	" Difficult , if not impossible!"--and
107855	107893	107840	107843	the gentle old lady	1553	clasp--"You are a genius yourself -- but you are a human little creature , not above the sweet and simple ways of life,--some of the poets and artists were and are in - human ! Now Mr. Jocelyn-- "
107894	107899	107901	107901	Innocent	152	" HE is human ! "
107903	107908	107901	107901	Innocent	152	quickly--"I'm sure of that ! "
107909	107959	107977	107977	she	152	" You are sure ? Well , dear , you like him very much and you have made a friend of him,--which is quite natural considering the long association you have had with his name -- such a curious and romantic coincidence!--but I hope he wo n't disappoint you . "
107965	107976	107977	107977	she	152	" Do n't be afraid , you dear little godmother ! "
107978	107996	107901	107901	Innocent	152	said--"I do n't expect anything of him , so no disappointment is possible ! Here we are ! "
108055	108062	108063	108063	she	152	" There was a true genius ! "
108064	108226	108233	108233	her	2041	said--"He might have been the greatest artist in England to - day if he had not let his impressions and prejudices overmaster his judgment . You know -- for I have told you my story -- that he loved me , or thought he did -- and I loved him and knew I did ! There was the difference between us ! He tired of me -- all artists tire of the one face -- they want dozens!--and he lost his head over some woman whose name I never knew . The result must have been fatal to his career , for it stopped short just when he was succeeding;--for me , it only left me resolved to be true to his memory till the end . But , my child , it 's a hard lot to be alone all one 's days , with only the remembrance of a past love to keep one 's heart from growing cold ! "
108245	108258	108259	108259	she	2041	" Why do you talk like this so sadly to - night ? "
108260	108269	108271	108271	she	2041	asked--"Has something reminded you of -- of HIM ? "
108279	108282	108284	108286	the old lady	1525	" Yes , "
108288	108322	108284	108286	the old lady	1525	simply--"Something has reminded me -- very much -- of him ! Good - night , dear little child ! Keep your beautiful dreams and ideals as long as you can ! Sleep well ! "

108682	108691	108692	108692	she	152	" To love without return -- without hope ! "
108693	108706	108674	108674	she	152	mused--"Oh , it would be torture!--to me , death ! Poor Robin ! "
108731	108735	108736	108736	she	152	" My love ! "
108740	108743	108744	108744	she	152	silence.--"My love ! "
108774	108778	108783	108783	she	152	" My love ! "

109239	109343	109235	109235	he	229	voce--"That child I met last night actually wrote this amazing piece of work ! It 's almost incredible ! A nice child too,--simple and perfectly natural,--nothing of the blue - stocking about her . Well , well ! What a career she 'll make!--what a name!--that is , if she takes care of herself and does n't fall in love , which she 's sure to do ! That 's the worst of women -- God occasionally gives them brains , but they 've scarcely begun to use them when heart and sentiment step in and overthrow all reason . Now , we men-- "
109393	109404	109405	109405	he	229	" For the moment it is perhaps worth everything else ! "
109406	109419	109420	109420	His	229	mused--"But -- for the moment only ! The ecstasy does not last . "
109472	109477	109478	109478	she	706	" Are you busy ? "
109479	109484	109507	109507	he	229	enquired--"May I come in ? "
109499	109506	109507	109507	he	229	" By all means come in ! "
109508	109513	109507	109507	he	229	said--"You have returned early ? "
109514	109517	109518	109518	She	706	" Yes . "
109543	109565	109507	109507	he	229	herself--"It was a boresome affair,--there were recitations and music which I hate -- so I came away . You are reading ? "
109566	109568	109569	109569	he	229	" Not now"--and
109577	109611	109569	109569	he	229	him--"But I HAVE been reading -- that amazing book by the young girl we met at the Deanshires ' last night -- Ena Armitage . It 's really a fine piece of work . "
109616	109628	109629	109629	he	229	" You did n't take to her , I 'm afraid ? "
109631	109650	109569	109569	he	229	on--"Yet she seemed a charming , modest little person . Perhaps she was not quite what you expected ? "
109659	109678	109651	109652	Lady Blythe	224	" You are right ! She certainly was not what I expected ! Is the door well shut ? "
109691	109698	109699	109699	he	229	" The door is quite closed , "
109705	109719	109699	109699	he	229	" One would think we were talking secrets -- and we never do ! "
109720	109723	109724	109724	she	706	" No ! "
109730	109746	109724	109724	she	706	curiously--"We never do . We are model husband and wife , having nothing to conceal ! "
109770	109778	109779	109779	he	229	" You have something to tell me , "
109782	109801	109779	109779	he	229	quietly--"Pray go on , and do n't let me interrupt you . Do you object to my smoking ? "
109802	109808	109812	109812	his	229	" Not in the least . "
109855	109859	109860	109860	she	706	" I suppose , "
109861	109878	109916	109916	His	229	began--"hardly anything in the social life of our day would very much surprise or shock you-- ? "
109879	109885	109886	109886	he	229	" Very little , certainly ! "
109890	109903	109916	109916	His	229	coldly--"I have lived a long time , and am not easily surprised ! "
109904	109915	109916	109916	His	229	" Not even if it concerned some one you know ? "
109930	109936	109937	109937	he	229	" Some one I know ? "
109938	109969	109916	109916	His	229	repeated--"Well , I should certainly be very sorry to hear anything of a scandalous nature connected with the girl we saw last night -- she looked too young and too innocent-- "
109970	109976	109978	109979	Lady Blythe	224	" Innocent -- oh yes ! "
109988	109993	109916	109916	His	229	excitement--"She is innocent enough ! "
109994	110016	110017	110017	He	229	" Pardon ! I thought you were about to speak of her , as you said she was not what you expected-- "
110029	110032	110033	110033	she	224	" Richard , "
110034	110075	110017	110017	He	229	said--"You are a good man , and you hold very strong opinions about truth and honour and all that sort of thing . I do n't believe you could ever understand badness -- real , downright badness -- could you ? "
110076	110084	110085	110085	he	229	" Badness ? ... in that child ? "
110096	110115	110116	110116	she	224	" Dear me , you are perfectly obsessed by ' that child , ' as you call her ! "
110117	110132	110017	110017	He	229	answered--"You had better know the truth then at once,--'that child ' is my daughter ! "
110133	110138	110116	110116	she	224	" Your daughter?--your -- your-- "
110167	110171	110172	110172	he	229	" Good God ! "
110174	110182	110017	110017	He	229	whispered--"What do you mean?--you have had no children-- "
110183	110188	110189	110189	she	224	" Not by you,--no ! "
110196	110257	110189	110189	she	224	scorn--"Not in marriage , that church - and - law form of union!--but by love and passion -- yes ! Stop!--do not look at me like that ! I have not been false to you -- I have not betrayed you ! Your honour has been safe with me ! It was before I met you that this thing happened . "
110265	110271	110017	110017	He	229	" Before you met me ? "
110272	110333	110189	110189	she	224	" Yes . I was a silly , romantic , headstrong girl,--my parents were compelled to go abroad , and I was left in the charge of one of my mother 's society friends -- a thoroughly worldly , unprincipled woman whose life was made up of intrigue and gambling . And I ran away with a man -- Pierce Armitage-- "
110334	110338	110017	110017	He	229	" Pierce Armitage ! "
110350	110361	110362	110362	He	229	" Yes -- Pierce Armitage . Did you know him ? "
110376	110386	110362	110362	He	229	" Know him ? He was my best friend ! "
110401	110544	110398	110398	her	2075	" Well , you never told me,--I have never heard you mention his name . But the world is a small place!--and when I was a girl he was beginning to be known by a good many people . Anyhow , he threw up everything in the way of his art and work , and ran away with me . I went quite willingly -- I took a maid whom we bribed,--we pretended we were married , and we had a charming time together -- a time of real romance , till he began to get tired and want change -- all men are like that ! Then he became a bore with a bad temper . He certainly behaved very well when he knew the child was coming , and offered to marry me in real earnest -- but I refused . "
110545	110549	110550	110551	Lord Blythe	229	" You refused ! "
110562	110749	110750	110750	She	2076	" Of course I did . He was quite poor -- and I should have been miserable running about the world with a man who depended on art for a living . Besides he was ceasing to be a lover -- and as a husband he would have been insupportable . We managed everything very well -- my own people were all in India -- and my mother 's friend , if she guessed my affair , said nothing about it,--wisely enough for her own sake!--so that when my time came I was able to go away on an easy pretext and get it all over secretly . Pierce came and stayed in a hotel close at hand -- he was rather in a fright lest I should die!--it would have been such an awkward business for him!--however , all went well , and when I had quite recovered he took the child away from me , and left it at an old farmhouse he had once made a drawing of , saying he would call back for it -- as if it were a parcel ! "
110754	110785	110750	110750	She	2076	" He wrote and told me what he had done and gave me the address of the farm -- then he went abroad , and I never heard of him again-- "
110786	110790	110792	110793	Lord Blythe	229	" He died , "
110795	110802	110792	110793	Lord Blythe	229	slowly--"He died -- alone and very poor-- "
110803	110809	110810	110810	she	2076	" So I was told , "
110813	110912	110810	110810	she	2076	indifferently--"Oh yes ! I see you look at me as if you thought I had no heart ! Perhaps I have not,--I used to have something like one,--your friend Armitage killed it in me . Anyhow , I knew the child had been adopted by the farm people as their own , and I took no further trouble . My parents came home from India to inherit an unexpected fortune , and they took me about with them a great deal -- they were never told of my romantic escapade!--then I met you -- and you married me . "
110924	110934	110935	110935	she	2078	" You are sorry you did , I suppose ! "
110943	111009	110935	110935	she	2078	way--"Anyhow , I tried to do my duty . When I heard by chance that the old farmer who had taken care of the child was dead , I made up my mind to go and see what she was like . I found her , and offered to adopt her -- but she would n't hear of it -- so I let her be . "
111022	111031	110935	110935	she	2078	" You told her you were her mother ? "
111032	111036	110935	110935	she	2078	" I did . "
111037	111048	111049	111049	She	2079	" And offered to ' adopt ' your own child ? "
111055	111072	110935	110935	she	2078	" It was the only thing to do ! One can not make a social scandal . "
111073	111078	110935	110935	she	2078	" And she refused ? "
111079	111083	110935	110935	she	2078	" She refused . "
111084	111091	111093	111094	Lord Blythe	229	" I admire her for it , "
111115	111133	111106	111106	He	2077	" You were unprepared for the strange compensation you have received?--the sudden fame of your deserted daughter ? "
111142	111173	110935	110935	she	2078	" I knew nothing of it ! Armitage is not an uncommon name , and I did not connect it with her . She has no right to wear it . "
111174	111204	111206	111207	Lord Blythe	229	" If her father were alive he would be proud that she wears it!--moreover he would give her the right to wear it , and would make it legal , "
111208	111241	110935	110935	she	2078	sternly--"Out of old memory I can say that for him ! You recognised each other at once , I suppose , when I presented her to you at the Duchess 's reception ? "
111242	111248	111250	111250	his	229	" Of course we did ! "
111251	111267	110935	110935	she	2078	wife--"You yourself saw that I was rather taken aback,--it was difficult to conceal our mutual astonishment-- "
111268	111274	110935	110935	she	2078	" It must have been ! "
111283	111318	110935	110935	she	2078	lips--"And you carried it off well ! But -- the poor child!--what an ordeal for her ! You can hardly have felt it so keenly , being seasoned to hypocrisy for so many years ! "
111336	111435	111436	111436	he	229	" Permit me to speak , Maude ! You can scarcely wonder that I am -- well!--a little shaken and bewildered by the confession you have made,--the secret you have -- after years of marriage -- suddenly divulged . You suggested -- at the beginning of this interview -- that perhaps there was nothing in the social life of our day that would very much shock or surprise me -- and I answered you that I was not easily surprised -- but -- I was thinking of others.--it did not occur to me that -- that my own wife-- "
111442	111453	111454	111454	he	229	continued--"that my own wife 's honour was involved in the matter-- "
111458	111573	111454	111454	he	229	" Sentiment is of course out of place -- nobody is supposed to feel anything nowadays -- or to suffer -- or to break one 's heart , as the phrase goes,--that would be considered abnormal , or bad form,--but I had the idea -- a foolish one , no doubt!--that though you may not have married me for love on your own part , you did so because you recognised the love,--the truth -- the admiration and respect -- on mine . I was at any rate happy in believing you did!--I never dreamed you married me for the sake of convenience!--to kill the memory of a scandal , and establish a safe position-- "
111591	111595	111596	111596	he	229	" One moment ! "
111598	111635	111574	111574	She	2081	on--"After what you have told me I hope you see clearly that it is impossible we can live together under the same roof again . If YOU could endure it , _ I _ could not ! "
111644	111688	111636	111636	She	2081	" What ? You mean to make trouble ? I , who have kept my own counsel all these years , am to be disgraced because I have at last confided in you ? You will scandalise society -- you will separate from me-- "
111716	111723	111724	111724	he	229	" I shall make no trouble , "
111727	111848	111724	111724	he	229	quietly--"and I shall not scandalise society . But I can not live with you . I will go away at once on some convenient excuse -- abroad -- anywhere -- and you can say whatever you please of my prolonged absence . If I could be of any use or protection to the girl I saw last night -- the daughter of my friend Pierce Armitage -- I would stay , but circumstances render any such service from me impossible . Besides , she needs no one to assist her -- she has made a position for herself -- a position more enviable than yours or mine . You have that to think about by way of -- consolation?--or reproach ? "
111862	111871	111872	111872	she	2082	" You can not forgive me , then ? "
111878	112174	112192	112192	He	2085	" Forgive you ! Is there a man who could forgive twenty years of deliberate deception from the wife he thought the soul of honour ? Maude , Maude ! We live in lax times truly , when men and women laugh at principle and good faith , and deal with each other less honestly than the beasts of the field,--but for me there is a limit!--a limit you have passed ! I think I could pardon your wrong to me more readily than I can pardon your callous desertion of the child you brought into the world -- your lack of womanliness -- motherliness!--your deliberate refusal to give Pierce Armitage the chance of righting the wrong he had committed in a headstrong , heart - strong rush of thoughtless passion!--he WOULD have righted it , I know , and been a loyal husband to you , and a good father to his child . For whatever his faults were he was neither callous nor brutal . You prevented him from doing this,--you were tired of him -- your so - called ' love ' for him was a mere selfish caprice of the moment -- and you preferred deceit and a rich marriage to the simple duty of a woman ! Well!--you may find excuses for yourself,--I can not find them for you ! I could not remain by your side as a husband and run the risk of coming constantly in contact , as we did last night , with that innocent girl , placed as she is , in a situation of so much difficulty , by the sins of her parents -- her mother , my wife!--her father , my dead friend ! The position is , and would be untenable ! "
112183	112188	112189	112189	she	2084	" Have you done ? "
112200	112236	112192	112192	He	2085	" I have . I have said all I wish to say . So far as I am concerned the incident is closed . I will only bid you good - night -- and farewell ! "
112237	112245	112246	112246	she	2084	" Good - night -- and farewell ! "
112263	112270	112271	112271	she	2084	" Oh dear , oh dear ! "
112279	112331	112332	112332	She	2084	mirth--"You are so very funny , you know ! Like -- what's - his - name?--Marius in the ruins of Carthage!--or one of those antique classical bores with their household gods broken around them ! You -- you ought to have lived in their days!--you are so terribly behind the times ! "
112337	112395	112396	112396	She	2084	" We do n't do the Marius and Carthage business now -- life 's too full and too short ! Really , Richard , I 'm afraid you 're getting very old!--poor dear!--past sixty I know!--and you 're quite prehistoric in some of your fancies!--'Good - night!'--er--'and farewell ! ' Sounds so stagey , does n't it ! "
112425	112482	112414	112414	her	2084	" Womanliness -- motherliness!--good Lord , deliver us!--I never thought you likely to preach at me -- if I had I would n't have told you anything ! I took you for a sensible man of the world -- but you are only a stupid old - fashioned thing after all ! Good - night!--and farewell ! "
112542	112547	112548	112548	she	2084	" Good - night!--farewell ! "
112757	112768	112769	112769	he	2086	" I will go and see her to - morrow , "
112772	112813	112769	112769	he	2086	himself--"It will be better for her to know that I have heard all her sad little history -- then -- if she ever wants a friend she can come to me without fear . Ah!--if only she were MY daughter ! "
112831	112838	112839	112839	he	2086	" If she were my daughter , "
112842	112854	112839	112839	he	2086	slowly--"I should be a proud man instead of a sorrowful one ! "
113006	113010	113011	113011	she	224	" Old fool ! "
113012	113170	113176	113176	him	2103	soliloquised--"He ought to know better than to play the tragic - sentimental with me at his time of life ! I thought he would accept the situation reasonably and help me to tackle it . Of course it will be simply abominable if I am to meet that girl at every big society function -- I do n't know what I shall do about it ! Why did n't she stay in her old farm - house!--who could ever have imagined her becoming famous ! I shall go abroad , I think -- that will be the best thing to do . If Blythe leaves me as he threatens , I shall certainly not stay here by myself to face the music ! Besides , who knows?--the girl herself may ' round ' on me when her head gets a little more swelled with success . Such a horrid bore!--I wish I had never seen Pierce Armitage ! "
113287	113292	113293	113293	she	2102	" And the child , "
113294	113311	113312	113312	She	2102	murmured--"The child -- it clung to me and I kissed it!--it was a dear little thing ! "
113326	113331	113332	113332	she	2102	" I must sleep ! "
113333	113346	113312	113312	She	2102	thought--"I am worried and out of sorts -- I must sleep and forget-- "
113364	113367	113347	113347	She	2102	" Veronal . "
113368	113380	113381	113381	she	2102	" One or two more or less will not hurt me , "
113394	113409	113381	113381	she	2102	mirror--"I am accustomed to it -- and I must have a good long sleep ! "

113490	113513	113454	113454	their	2793	" Oh no ! Mere accident!--an overdose of veronal -- some carelessness -- quite a common occurrence . Nothing to be done ! "
113549	113554	113555	113555	he	1834	" Good - night ! "

I think she ran rather wild at that time . There was some talk of her having gone off secretly somewhere with a lover -- but I never believed the story . It was a silly scandal -- and of course it stopped directly she married Lord Blythe . He gave her a splendid position,--and he was devoted to her -- poor man ! "

And she has made her name famous to escape the reproach of birth which others fastened upon her . A brave child!--it must have been strange to her to find her father 's portrait here -- did you ever speak of him to her ? "
116654	116657	116659	116660	Miss Leigh	239	" Often ! "
116662	116669	116659	116660	Miss Leigh	239	" She knows all my story ! "

116808	116854	116803	116803	he	229	" Miss Leigh knows , and _ I _ know that you are the daughter of Pierce Armitage , and that your mother was my late wife . No one can be dearer to us both than you are -- for your father 's sake ! "
116896	116902	116903	116903	she	2192	" How can you know ? "
116904	116909	116923	116923	he	229	faltered--"Who has told you ? "
116910	116922	116903	116903	she	2192	" Your mother herself told me on the night she died , "
116924	116938	116923	116923	he	229	answered--"She gave me all the truth of herself,--at last -- after long years ! "
116963	116970	116971	116971	she	2192	" My dear , my dear ! "
116972	116992	116939	116939	She	239	exclaimed--"I wish I had known it all before!--I might have done more -- I might have tried to be kinder-- "
117004	117012	117013	117013	she	414	" You would have tried in vain ! "
117018	117043	117013	117013	she	414	" No one on earth could have been kinder than my beloved little godmother ! You have been the dearest and best of friends ! "
117051	117066	117067	117067	she	414	" It is very good of you to come here and say what you have said"--and
117074	117131	117045	117045	she	414	accents--"But I am sorry that anyone knows my story -- it is no use to know it , really ! I should have always kept it a secret -- for it chiefly concerns me , after all,--and why should my existence cast a shadow on the memory of my father ? Perhaps you may have known him-- "
117132	117140	117142	117143	Lord Blythe	229	" I knew him and loved him ! "
117159	117181	117182	117182	she	414	" Well then , how hard it must be for you to think that he ever did anything unworthy of himself ! "
117183	117311	117345	117345	he	229	said--"And for this dear lady it is cruel!--for she loved him too . And what am I that I should cause all this trouble ! I am a nameless creature -- I took his name because I wanted to kindle a little light of my own round it -- I have done that ! And then I wanted to guard his memory from any whisper of scandal -- will you help me in this ? The secret must still be kept -- and no one must ever know I am his daughter . For though your wife is dead her name must not be shamed for the long ago sin of her youth -- nor must I be branded as what I am -- base - born . "
117339	117344	117345	117345	he	229	" My dear child , "
117348	117501	117345	117345	he	229	earnestly--"believe me , I shall never speak of your parentage or give the slightest hint to anyone of the true facts of your history -- still less would I allow you to be lightly esteemed for what is no fault of your own . You have made a brilliant name and fame for yourself -- you have the right to that name and fame . I came here to - day for two reasons -- one to tell you that I was fully acquainted with all you had endured and suffered -- the other to ask if you will let me be your guardian -- your other father -- and give me some right to shelter you from the rough ways of the world . I may perhaps in this way make some amends to you for the loss of mother - love and father - love -- I would do my best-- "
117532	117538	117539	117539	she	152	" How good you are ! "
117542	117588	117539	117539	she	152	softly--"You would take care of me -- you with your proud name and place!--and I -- the poor , unfortunately born child of your dead friend ! Ah , you kind , gentle heart!--I thank you!--but no!--I must not accept such a sacrifice on your part-- "
117589	117594	117596	117596	her	152	" It would be no sacrifice"--he
117598	117624	117596	117596	her	152	eagerly--"No , child!--it would be pure selfishness!--for I 'm getting old and am lonely -- and -- and I want someone to look after me ! "
117631	117642	117625	117625	He	2195	" Why not come to me and be my daughter ? "
117653	117666	117667	117667	she	152	" I will be a daughter to you in affection and respect , "
117668	117782	117643	117643	She	152	said--"But I will not take any benefits from you -- no , none ! Oh , I know well all you could and would do for me!--you would place me in the highest ranks of that society where you are a leader , and you would surround me with so many advantages and powerful friends that I should forget my duty , which is to work for myself , and owe nothing to any man ! Dear , kind Lord Blythe!--do not think me ungrateful ! But I have made my own little place in the world , and I must keep it -- independently ! Am I not right , my godmother ? "
117793	117804	117805	117805	she	239	" My dear , you must think well about it , "
117806	117840	117842	117844	the old lady	1525	said--"Lord Blythe would care for you as his own child , I am sure -- and his home would be a safe and splendid one for you -- but there!--do not ask ME ! "
117854	117882	117842	117844	the old lady	1525	eyes--"I am selfish!--and now I know you are Pierce 's daughter I want to keep you for myself!--to have you near me!--to look at you and love you!-- "
117908	117946	117947	117947	she	1525	" What did you think -- what must you have thought the first day you came here when I asked you if you were any relation to Pierce Armitage , and told you that was his portrait ! "
117952	117963	117964	117965	the girl	414	" I thought that God had guided me to you , "
117972	117983	117964	117965	the girl	414	accents--"And that my father 's spirit had not forsaken me ! "
117996	118001	117992	117992	she	1525	" Dear Lord Blythe , "
118003	118028	117992	117992	she	1525	said--"Now that you know so much may I tell you my own story ? It will not take long ! Come and sit here -- yes!"--and
118053	118107	118040	118040	she	1525	her--"It is nothing of a story!--my little life is not at all like the lives lived by all the girls of my age that I have ever met or seen -- it 's all in the past , as it were,--the old , very old past!--as far back as the days of Elizabeth ! "
118203	118209	118211	118211	she	1525	" Sieur Amadis de Jocelin . "
118225	118260	118220	118221	Lord Blythe	229	" Why , that 's a curious thing ! I know a rather clever painter named Amadis de Jocelyn -- and surely you were dancing with him on the evening I first met you ? "
118271	118283	118284	118284	she	1525	" Yes!--that is what I was just going to tell you ! "
118287	118340	118284	118284	she	1525	" He is another Amadis de Jocelyn!--and he is actually connected with a branch of the same family ! HIS ancestor was the brother of that very Amadis who lies buried at Briar Farm ! Is it not strange that I should have met him!--and he is going to paint my portrait ! "
118341	118346	118348	118349	Lord Blythe	229	" Is he indeed ! "
118353	118361	118284	118284	she	1525	impressed--"I thought he was a landscape man . "
118362	118367	118368	118368	she	1525	" So he is , "
118372	118426	118368	118368	she	1525	eagerness--"But he can do portraits -- and he wishes to make a picture of me , because I have been a student of the books written by one of his ancient line . Those books taught me all I know of literature . You see , it is curious , is n't it ? "
118427	118431	118432	118432	he	229	" It is , "
118436	118467	118432	118432	he	229	hesitatingly--"But I 've never quite liked Jocelyn -- he 's clever -- yet he has always struck me as being intensely selfish,--a callous sort of man -- many artists are . "
118480	118492	118493	118493	she	1525	" I suppose all clever men get self - absorbed sometimes ! "
118502	118511	118493	118493	she	1525	wisdom--"But I do n't think he is really callous-- "
118518	118599	118512	118512	She	1525	brightly--"Anyhow we need n't discuss him -- need we ? I just wanted to tell you what an odd experience it has been for me to meet and to know someone descended from the family of the old French knight whose spirit was my instructor in beautiful things ! The little books of his own poems were full of loveliness -- and I used to read them over and over again . They were all about love and faith and honour-- "
118600	118607	118609	118610	Lord Blythe	229	" Very old - fashioned subjects ! "
118615	118623	118609	118610	Lord Blythe	229	smile--"And not very much in favour nowadays ! "
118631	118636	118637	118637	she	239	" You think not ? "
118646	118656	118657	118657	he	229	" It is difficult to know what to think , "
118658	118722	118723	118723	he	229	answered--"But I have lived a long life -- long enough to have seen the dispersal of many illusions ! I fear selfishness is the keynote of the greater part of humanity . Those who do the kindest deeds are invariably the worst rewarded -- and love in its highest form is so little known that it may be almost termed non - existent . You"--and
118726	118814	118657	118657	he	229	Innocent--"you write in a very powerful and convincing way about things of which you can have had no real experience -- and therein lies your charm ! You restore the lost youth of manhood by idealisation , and you compel your readers to ' idealise ' with you -- but ' to idealise ' is rather a dangerous verb!--and its conjugation generally means trouble and disaster . Ideals -- unless they are of the spiritual kind unattainable on this planet -- are apt to be very disappointing . "
118818	118834	118835	118835	she	152	" But love is an ideal which can not disappoint , because it is everlasting ! "
118841	118876	118835	118835	she	152	" The story of the old French knight is , in its way , a proof of that . He loved his ideal all his life , even though he could not win her . "
118877	118883	118884	118884	he	229	" Very wonderful if true ! "
118885	118961	118835	118835	she	152	answered--"But I can not quite believe it ! I am too familiar with the ways of my own sex ! Anyhow , dear child , I should advise you not to make too many ideals apart from the characters in the books you write . Fortunately your special talent brings you an occupation which will save you from that kind of thing . You have ambition as an incentive , and fame for a goal . "
119009	119024	119025	119025	she	152	" Well , now you know what my ' literary education ' has been , "
119027	119119	119140	119140	he	229	on--"Since I came to London I have tried to improve myself as much as I can -- and I have read a great many modern books -- but to me they seem to lack the real feeling of the old - time literature . For instance , if you read the account of the battle of the Armada by a modern historian it sounds tame and cold,--but if you read the same account in Camden 's ' Elizabeth'--the whole scene rises before you,--you can almost see every ship riding the waves ! "
119131	119139	119140	119140	he	229	" I see you are an enthusiast ! "
119141	119207	119210	119210	him	229	said--"And you could not have better teachers than the Elizabethans . They lived in a great age and they were great men . Our times , though crowded with the splendid discoveries of science , seem small and poor compared to theirs . If you ever come to me , I can give you the run of a library where you will find many friends . "
119219	119269	119216	119216	he	229	" You will come and see me often , will you not?--you and Miss Leigh -- by - and - by , when the conventional time of mourning for my poor wife is over . Make my house your second home , both of you!--and when I return from Italy-- "
119270	119273	119274	119275	the girl	414	" Oh ! "
119278	119284	119274	119275	the girl	414	impulsively--"Are you going to Italy ? "
119285	119302	119216	119216	he	229	" For a few weeks -- yes!--will you come with me -- you and your godmother ? "
119339	119344	119345	119345	she	414	" I must not ! "
119346	119373	119216	119216	he	229	said-"-I am bound to finish some work that I have promised . But some day -- ah , yes!--some day I should love to see Italy ! "
119382	119426	119345	119345	she	414	" Some day!--well!--I hope I may live to be with you on that ' some day . ' I ought not to leave London just now -- but the house is very lonely -- and I think I am best away for a time-- "
119427	119431	119433	119434	Miss Leigh	239	" Much best ! "
119436	119444	119433	119434	Miss Leigh	239	sympathetically--"And if there is anything we can do-- "
119445	119459	119461	119462	Lord Blythe	229	" Yes -- there is one thing that will please me very much , "
119471	119491	119493	119493	he	2203	case--"I want my friend Pierce 's daughter to wear this -- it was my first gift to her mother . "
119524	119532	119493	119493	he	2203	" I gave it as an emblem of innocence"--a
119536	119560	119493	119493	he	2203	him--"I little knew!--but you , dear girl , are the one to wear it now ! Let me fasten it round your neck . "

There are always spiteful tongues wagging in the secret corners and byways , ready to assert that her work is not her own and that some man is in the background , helping to keep her ! "

120055	120110	120134	120135	Miss Leigh	239	answered--"We are to begin our sittings next week . I am to wear a white frock -- and I told him about my dove Cupid , and how it used to fly from the gables of the house to my hand -- and he is going to paint the bird as well as me ! "
120120	120128	120184	120184	she	239	" Fancy ! Cupid will be there ! "
120129	120132	120134	120135	Miss Leigh	239	" Cupid ? "
120139	120162	120184	120184	she	239	" Yes -- Cupid!--usually known as the little god of love,--but only a dove this time!--so much more harmless than the god ! "
120175	120183	120184	120184	she	239	" You have a dove there now , "
120185	120222	120184	120184	she	239	said--"All in jewels ! And in your heart , dear child , I pray there is a spiritual dove of holy purity to guard you from all evil and keep your sweet soul safe and clean ! "
120247	120257	120258	120258	she	239	" A blessing or a warning , godmother mine ? "

Some of these , more foolish than the rest , expressed themselves as afraid or unwilling to meet her--"lest

120546	120599	120521	120521	she	152	" for so much as the humblest paragraphist . It was quite true that she showed herself sadly deficient in the appreciation of society functions and society people,--to her they seemed stupid and boresome , involving much waste of precious time,--but notwithstanding this , she was invited everywhere , and the accumulation of "
120601	120714	120521	120521	she	152	" cards on her table and desk made such a formidable heap that it was quite a business to clear them , as she did once a week , with the assistance of the useful waste - paper basket . As a writer her popularity was unquestionable , and so great and insistent was the public demand for anything from her pen that she could command her own terms from any publishing quarter . Her good fortune made very little effect upon her,--sometimes it seemed as if she hardly realised or cared to realise it . She had odd , almost child - like ways of spending some of her money in dainty "
120716	120986	120521	120521	she	152	" gifts to her friends -- that is to say , such friends as had shown her kindness,--beautiful flowers and fruit for invalids -- choice wines for those who needed yet could not afford them,--a new drawing - room carpet for Miss Leigh , which was , in the old lady 's opinion , a most important and amazing affair!--costly furs , also for Miss Leigh,--and devices and adornments of all sorts for the pleasure , beauty or comfort of the house -- but on herself personally she spent nothing save what was necessary for such dress and appearance as best accorded with her now acknowledged position . Dearly as she would have loved to shower gifts and benefits on the inhabitants of never - forgotten Briar Farm , she knew that if she did anything of the kind poor lonely old Priscilla Friday and patiently enduring Robin Clifford were more likely to be hurt than gratified . For a silence had fallen between that past life , which had been like a wild rose blossoming in a country lane , and the present one , which resembled a wonderful orchid flower , flaming in heat under glass,--and though she wrote to Robin now and again , and he replied , his letters were restrained and formal -- almost cold . He knew too well how far she was removed from him by more than distance , and bravely contented himself with merely giving her such news of the farm and her former home surroundings as might awaken her momentary interest without recalling too many old memories to her mind .

122833	122930	122807	122807	He	2242	said--"It 's a great thing for a young girl like you who are all alone in the world , to be taken in hand by such a man as Blythe . He 's a statesman,--very useful to his country,--he 's very rich and has a splendid position . His wife 's sudden death has left him very lonely as he has no children,--you could be a daughter to him , and it would be a great leap upwards for you , socially speaking . You would be much better off under his care than scribbling books . "

You are such an armful of sweetness -- such a warm , nestling little bird of love in my arms!--and to think that you actually write books that the world talks about!--the thing is so incongruous -- so ' out of drawing ' that it makes me laugh ! I do n't like writing women as a rule -- they give themselves too many airs to please me -- but you-- "
123062	123068	123069	123069	she	2245	" Well , go on , "

123204	123211	123212	123212	she	2245	" I HAVE read about them , "
123213	123303	123169	123169	her	2245	said--"Walter Scott was popular and made money,--Charles Dickens was popular and made money -- Thackeray was popular and made money -- Shakespeare himself seemed to have had the one principal aim of making sufficient money enough to live comfortably in his native town , and he was ' popular ' in his day -- indeed he ' played to the gallery . ' But he was not a ' failure'--and the whole world acknowledges his greatness now , though in his life - time he was unconscious of it . "
123316	123321	123322	123322	he	2246	" Very well spoken ! "
123325	123383	123322	123322	he	2246	condescendingly--"I see you take a high view of your art ! But like all women , you wander from the point . We were talking of Lord Blythe -- and I say it would be far better for you to be -- well!--his heiress!--for he might leave you all his fortune -- than go on writing books . "
123419	123425	123426	123426	he	2246	" What have I said ? "
123429	123441	123442	123442	he	2246	coaxingly--"Innocent -- sweet little love ! Forgive me if I have -- what?"--and
123444	123451	123442	123442	he	2246	softly--"rubbed you up the wrong way ! "

123486	123511	123482	123482	she	2245	last--"I thought -- I hoped -- you might be proud of my work , Amadis ! I was planning it all for that ! You see"--she
123512	123595	123458	123458	her	2245	hesitated--"I learned so much from the Sieur Amadis de Jocelin -- the brother of your ancestor!--that I have been thinking all the time how I could best show you that I was worthy of his teaching . The world -- or the public -- you know the things they say of me -- but I do not want their praise . I believe I could do something really great if YOU cared!--for now it is only to please you that I live . "
123607	123610	123611	123611	he	2247	" Nonsense ! "
123615	123646	123611	123611	he	2247	brusquely--"You have a thousand other things to live for -- you must not think of pleasing me only . Besides I 'm not very -- keen on literature,--I'm a painter . "
123647	123655	123656	123656	she	2248	" Surely painting owes something to literature ? "
123657	123679	123611	123611	he	2247	queried--"We should not have had all the wonderful Madonnas and Christs of the old masters if there had been no Bible ! "
123680	123690	123691	123691	he	2247	" True!--but perhaps we could have done without them ! "
123694	123745	123691	123691	he	2247	lightly--"I'm not at all sure that painting would not have got on just as well without literature at all . There is always nature to study -- sky , sea , landscape and the faces of lovely women and children,--quite enough for any man . Where is Lord Blythe now ? "

She is not as bright as she used to be , and looks very pale , so that I fear she is doing too much , though she says she is perfectly well and happy . We had a call from Mr. John Harrington the other afternoon -- I think you know him -- and he seemed quite to think with me that she is over - working herself . He suggested that I should persuade her to go for a change somewhere , either with me or with other friends . I wonder if you would care for us to join you at the Italian Lakes ? If you would I might be able to manage it . I have not mentioned the idea to her yet , as I know she is finishing some work -- but she tells me it will all be done in a few days , and that then she will take a rest . I hope she will , for I 'm sure she needs it . "
130275	130399	130055	130055	she	239	" I rather hesitate to mention it , but I think so many prolonged sittings for her portrait to that painter with the strange name , Amadis de Jocelyn , have rather tired her out . The picture is finished now , and I and a few friends went to see it the other day . It is a most beautiful portrait , but very sad!--and it is wonderful how the likeness of her father as he was in his young days comes out in her face ! She and Mr. de Jocelyn are very intimate friends -- and some people say he is in love with her ! Perhaps he may be!--but I do hope she is not in love with HIM ! "

132692	132701	132703	132703	Blythe	229	" She told me the night she died , "
132704	132712	132683	132683	he	227	quietly--"After a silence of nearly twenty years ! "
132721	132727	132728	132728	he	227	" Women are strange creatures ! "
132731	132770	132728	132728	he	227	" I do n't think they know when they are loved . I loved her -- much more than she knew,--she seemed to me the most beautiful thing on earth!--and when she asked me to run away with her-- "
132771	132776	132713	132713	Armitage	227	" She asked you ? "
132777	132960	132728	132728	he	227	" Yes -- of course ! Do you think I would have taken her against her own wish and will ? She suggested and planned the whole thing -- and I was mad for her at the time -- even now those weeks we passed together seem to me the only real living of my life ! I thought she loved me as I loved her -- and if she had married me , as I begged her to do , I believe I should have done something as a painter,--something great , I mean . But she got tired of my ' art - jargon , ' as she called it -- and she could n't bear the idea of having to rough it a bit before I could hope to make any large amount of money . Then I was disappointed -- and I told her so -- and SHE was disappointed , and she told ME so -- and we quarrelled -- but when I heard a child was to be born , I urged her again to marry me-- "
132961	132966	132968	132968	Blythe	229	" And she refused ? "
132970	133032	132728	132728	he	227	" She refused . She said she intended to make a rich marriage and live in luxury . And she declared that if I ever loved her at all , the only way to prove it was to get rid of the child . I do n't think she would have cared if I had been brute enough to kill it . "
133040	133053	132728	132728	he	227	" Do n't say that , man ! Do n't think it ! "
133057	133243	133054	133054	Armitage	227	" Well , I ca n't help it , Blythe ! Some women go callous when they 've had their fling . Maude was like that . She did n't care for me any more,--she saw nothing in front of her but embarrassment and trouble if her affair with me was found out -- and as it was all in my hands I did the best I could think of,--took the child away and placed it with kind country folks -- and removed myself from England and out of Maude 's way altogether . The year after I came abroad I heard she had married you,--rather an unkind turn of fate , you being my oldest friend ! and this was what made me resolve to ' die'--that is , to be reported dead , so that she might have no misgivings about me or my turning up unexpectedly to cause you any annoyance . I determined to lose myself and my name too -- no one knows me here as Pierce Armitage,--I'm Pietro Corri for all the English amateur art - lovers in Italy ! "
133249	133264	133265	133265	he	2413	" I think I lost a good deal more than myself and my name ! "
133269	133331	133265	133265	he	2413	" I believe if I had stayed in England I should have won something of a reputation . But -- you see , I really loved Maude -- in a stupid man 's way of love,--I did n't want to worry her or remind her of her phase of youthful madness with me -- or cause scandal to her in any way-- "
133332	133342	133344	133344	Blythe	229	" But did you ever think of the child ? "
133352	133564	133265	133265	he	2413	" Think of it ? Of course I did ! The place where I left it was called Briar Farm,--a wonderful old sixteenth - century house -- I made a drawing of it once when the apple - blossom was out -- and the owner of it , known as Farmer Jocelyn , had a wonderful reputation in the neighbourhood for integrity and kindness . I left the child with him -- one stormy night in autumn -- saying I would come back for it -- of course I never did -- but for twelve years I sent money for it from different places in Europe -- and before I left England I told Maude where it was , in case she ever wanted to see it -- not that such an idea would ever occur to her ! I thought the probabilities were that the farmer , having no children of his own , would be likely to adopt the one left on his hands , and that she would grow up a happy , healthy country lass , without a care , and marry some good , sound , simple rustic fellow . But you know everything , I suppose!--or so your looks imply . Is the child alive ? "
133572	133582	133583	133583	he	229	" Now , Pierce , it is my turn , "
133584	133611	133726	133726	he	229	said--"Your share in the story I already knew in part -- but one thing you have not told me -- one wrong you have not confessed . "
133612	133624	133626	133626	Armitage	227	" Oh , there are a thousand wrongs I have committed , "
133635	133662	133626	133626	Armitage	227	" Life and love have both disappointed me -- and I suppose when that sort of thing happens a man goes more or less to the dogs-- "
133663	133674	133726	133726	he	229	" Life and love have disappointed a good many folks , "
133676	133709	133626	133626	Armitage	227	Blythe--"Women perhaps more than men . And one woman especially , who hardly merited disappointment -- one who loved you very truly , Pierce!--have you any idea who it is I mean ? "
133719	133725	133726	133726	he	229	" You mean Lavinia Leigh ? "
133727	133772	133773	133773	He	229	said--"Yes -- I behaved like a cad . I know it ! But -- I could not help myself . Maude drew me on with her lovely eyes and smile ! And to think she is dead!--all that beauty in the grave!--cold and mouldering ! "
133788	133860	133861	133861	He	229	" Somehow I have always fancied her as young as ever and endowed with a sort of earthly immortality ! She was so bright , so imperious , so queen - like ! You ask me why I did not let you know I was living ? Blythe , I would have died in very truth by my own hand rather than trouble her peace in her married life with you ! "
133877	133885	133861	133861	He	229	smile--"And -- do you know Lavinia Leigh ? "
133886	133890	133861	133861	He	229	" I do , "
133892	133907	133861	133861	He	229	Blythe--"I know and honour her ! And -- your daughter is with her now ! "
133912	133922	133908	133908	Armitage	227	" My daughter ! With Lavinia ! No!--impossible -- incredible!-- "
133923	133930	133934	133934	himself	229	" Sit down again , Pierce , "
133941	133994	133934	133934	himself	229	Armitage--"Sit down and be patient ! You know the lines--'There 's a divinity that shapes our ends , rough - hew them how we will ' ? Divinity has worked in strange ways with you , Pierce!--and still more strangely with your child . Will you listen while I tell you all ? "
134023	134037	134038	134038	he	227	" I will listen as if you were an angel speaking , Dick ! "
134041	134053	134038	134038	he	227	" Let me know the worst!--or the best -- of everything ! "
134108	134110	134116	134116	she	152	" Ena Armitage"--of
134178	134196	134197	134197	he	227	" But now you have turned up , Pierce , I resign my hopes in that direction ! "
134204	134258	134197	134197	he	227	" You are her father!--and you may well be proud of such a daughter ! And there is a duty staring you in the face -- a duty towards her which , when once performed , will release her from a good deal of pain and perplexity -- you know what it is ? "
134259	134262	134264	134264	Armitage	227	" Rather ! "
134271	134316	134325	134325	his	227	fro--"To acknowledge and legalise her as my child ! I can do this now -- and I will ! I can declare she was born in wedlock , now Maude is dead -- for no one will ever know . The real identity of her mother"--he
134329	134343	134350	134350	Armitage	227	shoulders--"the real identity of her mother is and shall ever be OUR secret ! "
134360	134369	134370	134370	he	227	" I can never thank you , Blythe ! "
134371	134484	134350	134350	Armitage	227	said--"You blessed old man as you are ! You seem to me like a god disguised in a tweed suit ! You have changed life for me altogether ! I must cease to be a wandering scamp on the face of the earth!--I must try to be worthy of my fair and famous daughter ! How strange it seems ! Little Innocent!--the poor baby I left to the mercies of a farm - yard training!--for her I must become respectable ! I think I 'll even try to paint a great picture , so that she is n't ashamed of her Dad ! What do you say ? Will you help me ? "
134509	134519	134520	134520	he	2420	" I 'll wire to Miss Leigh this morning , "
134523	134563	134520	134520	he	2420	" I 'll ask her to come out here with Innocent as soon as possible . I wo n't break the news of YOU to them yet -- it would quite overpower Miss Leigh -- it might almost kill her-- "
134564	134569	134571	134571	Armitage	227	" Why , how ? "
134573	134577	134579	134579	Blythe	229	" With joy ! "
134581	134588	134579	134579	Blythe	229	" Hers is a faithful soul ! "
134598	134636	134589	134589	He	2420	" I 'll prepare the way cautiously in a letter -- it would never do to blurt the whole thing out at once . I 'll tell Innocent I have a very great and delightful surprise awaiting her-- "
134637	134646	134648	134648	Armitage	227	" Oh , very great and delightful indeed ! "
134655	134680	134648	134648	Armitage	227	" The discovery of a tramp father with only a couple of shirts to his back and a handful of francs in his pocket ! "
134681	134691	134693	134693	Blythe	229	" My dear chap , what does that matter ? "
134704	134811	134693	134693	Blythe	229	" We can put all these exterior matters right in no time . Trust me!--Are we not old friends ? You have come back from death , as it seems , just when your child may need you -- she DOES need you -- every young girl needs some protector in this world , especially when her name has become famous , and a matter of public talk and curiosity . Ah ! I can already see her joy when she throws her arms around your neck and says ' My father ! ' I would gladly change places with you for that one exquisite moment ! "
134884	134887	134914	134914	his	229	" Pietro Corri "
134898	134901	134914	134914	his	229	" Yes , "
134947	134995	134930	134930	he	229	success--"When she comes she will give you all her heart , Pierce ! She will be proud and glad,--she will think of no one but her beloved father ! She is like that ! She is full of an unspent love -- you will possess it all ! "
135126	135135	135136	135136	she	152	" Summer is over , I 'm afraid ! "
135137	135168	135242	135242	She	152	sighed--"Such a wonderful summer it has been for me!--the summer of my life -- the summer of my love ! Oh , dear summer , stay just a little longer ! "
135189	135241	135136	135136	she	152	" Falling leaf and fading tree , Lines of white in a sullen sea , Shadows rising on you and me -- The swallows are making them ready to fly , Wheeling out on a windy sky : Good - bye , Summer ! Good - bye , good - bye ! "

135845	135865	135842	135842	he	1633	kindly--"And you must have worked very hard . I hope you 'll give yourself a good long rest now ? "
135871	135876	135877	135877	she	239	" Oh , well!--perhaps ! "
135878	135936	135957	135957	he	1637	answered--"If I feel I can afford it ! I want to work while I 'm young -- not to rest . But I think Miss Leigh would like a change -- and if she does I 'll take her wherever she wishes to go . She is so kind to me!--I can never do enough for her ! "
135948	135956	135957	135957	he	1637	" Do you never think of yourself ? "
135958	135967	135937	135938	The publisher	1637	asked--"Must you always plan some pleasure for others ? "
135976	135982	135983	135983	she	239	" Why , of course ! "
135984	136026	135968	135968	She	239	replied--"Pleasure for others is the only pleasure possible to me . I assure you I 'm quite selfish!--I'm greedy for the happiness of those I love -- and if they ca n't or wo n't be happy I 'm perfectly miserable ! "
136051	136063	136064	136064	he	1637	" You wo n't let me call you a brilliant author , "

136802	136809	136810	136810	she	152	" What can not go on ? "
136827	136879	136759	136759	he	1637	" Why -- this -- this love - making , of ours ! We must n't give ourselves over to sentiment -- we must be normal and practical . We must look the thing squarely in the face and settle on some course that will be best and wisest for us both-- "
136896	136902	136903	136903	she	152	" Yes -- I know , "

137035	137051	136993	136993	her	152	said--"What is it ? You frighten me!--you speak so strangely ! What do you mean ? "
137052	137063	137064	137064	he	1637	" Now if you are unreasonable I shall go away ! "

137126	137136	137137	137137	she	152	" I -- I am not unreasonable , Amadis , "
137138	137144	137187	137187	Her	152	faltered--"only -- I do n't understand-- "
137145	137153	137154	137154	he	1637	" Well , you ought to understand , "
137157	137186	137154	137154	he	1637	heatedly--"A clever little woman like you who writes books should not want any explanation . You ought to be able to grasp the whole position at a glance ! "

137213	137227	137210	137210	she	152	gently--"For I can only see that you seem angry with me for nothing . "
137234	137244	137245	137245	he	1637	" Dear little goose , I am not angry , "
137246	137323	137228	137228	He	1637	said--"If you were to make me a ' scene ' I SHOULD be angry -- very angry ! But you wo n't do that , will you ? It would upset my nerves . And you are such a wise , independent little person that I feel quite safe with you . Well , now let us talk sensibly,--I've a great deal to tell you . In the first place , I 'm going to Algiers . "
137336	137339	137245	137245	he	1637	" When ? "
137340	137380	137381	137381	Her	152	" Oh , any time!--to - morrow ... next day -- before the week is over , certainly . There are some fine subjects out there that I want to paint -- and I feel I could do good work-- "

137426	137436	137395	137395	herself	152	carelessly--"In the spring perhaps,--perhaps not for a year or two-- "
137437	137440	137395	137395	herself	152	" Amadis ! "
137478	137481	137482	137482	he	2459	" Well ! "
137483	137497	137445	137445	her	152	rejoined--"You say ' Amadis ' as though it hurt you ! What now ? "
137498	137503	137504	137504	she	152	" Do you mean , "
137507	137524	137504	137504	she	152	faintly--"by -- what -- you -- say,--do you mean -- that we are -- to part ? "
137552	137560	137561	137561	he	2459	" We must part sooner or later , "
137564	137569	137561	137561	he	2459	lightly--"surely you know that ? "
137570	137576	137577	137577	she	152	" Surely I know that ! "
137591	137625	137588	137588	she	152	arm--"Amadis ! Amadis ! You do n't mean it!--say you do n't mean it!--You ca n't mean it , if you love me ! ... Oh , my dearest!--if you love me ! ... "
137660	137667	137668	137668	he	2459	" Of course I love you ! "
137671	137696	137668	137668	he	2459	hurriedly--"When you are good and reasonable!--not when you behave like this ! If I DON'T love you , it will be quite your own fault-- "
137697	137702	137703	137703	she	152	" My own fault ? "
137706	137717	137703	137703	she	152	sobbingly--"My own fault ? Amadis ! What have I done ? "
137718	137750	137751	137751	She	152	" What have you done ? It 's what you are doing that matters ! Giving way to temper and making me uncomfortable ! Do you call that ' love ' ? "
137773	137782	137783	137783	she	152	" Please -- please do n't misunderstand me ! "
137789	137815	137783	137783	she	152	child--"I -- I have no temper ! I -- I -- feel nothing -- I only want to please you -- to know what you wish-- "
137856	137872	137873	137873	he	2459	" If you want to please me you will first of all be perfectly normal , "
137874	137919	137850	137850	He	2459	said--"Make up your mind to be calm and good - natured . I can not stand an emotional woman all tantrums and tears . I like good sense and good manners . You ought to have both , with all the books you have read-- "
137931	137934	137935	137935	she	152	" Books ! "
137960	137974	137945	137945	she	152	" Ah yes ! Books ! Books by the Sieur Amadis de Jocelin ! "
138001	138008	138009	138009	he	2459	" Your hair is coming down , "

138115	138118	138119	138119	She	152	retorted--"Be normal ! "
138163	138170	138171	138171	he	2459	" You see , dear child , "

Of course , with a sweet caressable creature like you it 's very pleasant to indulge in a little folly for a time,--and we 've had quite four months of the ' divine rapture ' as the poets call it,--four months is a long time for any rapture to last ! You have -- yes!--you have amused me!--and I 've made you happy -- given you something to think about besides scribbling and publishing -- yes -- I'm sure I have made you happy -- and,--what is much more to my credit -- I have taken care of you and left you unharmed . Think of that ! Day after day I have had you here entirely in my power!--and yet -- and yet"--here

I know , of course , what YOU would like . You would like a grand wedding with lots of millinery and presents , and then a honeymoon at your old Briar Farm -- in fact , I daresay you 'd like to buy Briar Farm and imprison me there for life , along with the dust and ashes of my ancestor 's long - lost brother -- but I should n't like it ! No , child!--not even you , attractive as you are , could turn me into a Farmer Jocelyn ! "
138838	138843	138844	138844	she	2467	" You speak truly , "

Oh , say it is n't true!--say it is n't true ! Have mercy -- mercy ! I love you , I love you ! You are all my life!--I can not live without you ! Amadis ! "

Oh , no , no ! Let me die rather than that!--you would not think unkindly of me if I were dead ! "

139339	139351	139352	139352	he	2468	" I should think of you exactly as I do now , "
139355	139436	139352	139352	he	2468	resolutely--"If you were to kill yourself I should not pity you in the least ! I should say that though you were a bit of a clever woman , you were much more of a fool ! So you would gain nothing that way ! You see , I 'm sane and sensible -- you are not . You are excited and hysterical -- and do n't know what you are talking about . Yes , child!--that 's the fact ! "
139451	139529	139437	139437	He	2468	" I wish you 'd get up from the floor and be reasonable ! The position is quite simple and clear . We 've had an ideal time of it together -- but is n't it Shakespeare who says ' These violent delights have violent ends ' ? My work calls me to Algiers -- yours keeps you in London -- therefore we must part -- but we shall meet again -- some day -- I hope ... "
139539	139547	139548	139548	she	2469	" Then -- you never loved me ? "
139549	139555	139646	139646	he	2470	said--"It was all a lie ? "
139556	139561	139562	139562	he	2470	" I never lie , "
139565	139578	139562	139562	he	2470	coldly--"I loved you -- for the time being . You amused me . "
139579	139591	139646	139646	he	2470	" And for your ' amusement ' you have ruined me ? "
139592	139596	139597	139597	He	2470	" Ruined you ? "

140015	140097	140098	140098	He	2471	said--"For heaven 's sake have done with all this sentimental talk!--I am not a man who can tolerate it . You are such a pleasant creature when you are cheerful and self - possessed,--so bright and clever and companionable -- and there is no reason why we should n't make love to each other again as often as we like,--but change and novelty are good for both of us . Come!--kiss me!--be a good child -- and let us part friends ! "

You must n't think of love any more!--that 's only a fancy!--you mustn't -- no , you must n't have any fancies or your dove will fly away ! You are holding it to your heart just now -- and it seems quite safe -- but it will fly away presently -- yes!--it will fly away ! "

Straight home , I suppose , to Miss Leigh,--will she tell Miss Leigh ? No -- I think not!--she 's not likely to tell anybody . She 'll keep it all to herself . She 's a silly little fool!--but she's -- she 's loyal ! "

Curious!--very curious that a sixteenth - century member of my own family tree should be mixed up in my affair with this girl ! Of course she 'll say nothing,--there 's nothing to say ! We 've kept our secret very well , and except for a few playful suggestions and hints dropped here and there , nobody knows we were in love with each other . Then -- she 's got her work to do,--it is n't as if she were an idle woman without an occupation,--and she 'll think it down and live it down . Of course she will ! I 'm worrying myself quite needlessly ! It will be all right . And as she does n't go to her Briar Farm now , I daresay she 'll even forget her fetish of a knight , the ' Sieur Amadis de Jocelin ' !

145388	145441	145381	145381	She	121	rapidly--"It is raining -- yes ! Oh , yes -- raining very much!--such a cold , sharp rain ! I 've walked quite a long way -- but I felt I must come back to you , Amadis!--just to ask you once more to say a kind word - to kiss me ... "
145468	145482	145483	145483	she	121	" She does n't know what she 's talking about , poor lamb ! "
145484	145499	145444	145444	her	121	thought,--"Just wandering and off her head!--and fancying things about that old French knight again ! "
145549	145561	145562	145562	she	121	" There , dear lad , do n't look like that ! "
145565	145605	145562	145562	she	121	" Go , and come back in a few minutes with the wine -- we'll be ready for you then . Cheer up!--she 's opened her pretty eyes once -- she'll open them again directly and smile at you ! "
145918	145921	145922	145922	she	121	" Priscilla ! "
145923	145946	145891	145891	her	152	said--"I believe it is Priscilla I Oh , dear Priscilla ! I called you but you would not hear or answer me ! "
145947	145957	145958	145958	Priscilla	121	" Oh , my lamb , I heard ye right enough!"--and
145966	145980	145958	145958	Priscilla	121	hands--"But I could n't think it was yourself -- I thought I was dreaming-- "
145981	145986	145987	145987	she	121	" So did I ! "
145989	146059	145958	145958	Priscilla	121	feebly--"I thought I was dreaming ... yes!--I have been dreaming such a long , long time ! All dreams ! I have walked through the rain -- it was very dark and the wind was cold and cruel -- but I walked on and on -- I do n't know how I came -- but I wanted to get home to Briar Farm -- do you know Briar Farm ? "
146079	146118	146077	146077	Priscilla	121	gently--"You're in Briar Farm now , dearie!--Surely you know you are ! This is your own old home -- don't you know it?--don't you remember the old kitchen?--of course you do ! There , there!--look up and see ! "
146132	146135	146136	146136	she	121	" No ! "
146137	146179	146077	146077	Priscilla	121	murmured--"I wish I could believe it , but I can not . I believe nothing now . It is all strange to me -- I have lost the way home , and I shall never find it -- never -- never ! "
146192	146197	146198	146198	she	121	" Who is that ? "
146218	146223	146224	146224	he	126	" It 's Robin ! "
146225	146234	146254	146254	she	121	said--"Dear Innocent , do n't you know me ? "
146250	146253	146254	146254	she	121	" Robin ? "
146255	146271	146272	146272	She	121	queried--"Oh , no!--you can not be Robin -- he is ever so many miles away ! "
146286	146356	146254	146254	she	121	" I thought for a moment you might be Amadis -- his hair is like yours , thick and soft -- you know him , of course -- he is the great painter , Amadis de Jocelyn -- all the world has heard of him ! He went out just now and shut the door and locked it -- but he will come back -- yes!--he will come back ! "
146401	146429	146430	146430	She	121	" He will come back -- he must come back ! Amadis!--Amadis!--you will not leave me all alone?--No , no , you can not be so cruel ! "
146444	146449	146452	146452	Priscilla	121	air--"Priscilla ! ... Priscilla ! "
146470	146553	146464	146464	she	121	" The old motto!--you remember it?--the motto of the Sieur Amadis de Jocelin!--'Mon coeur me soutien ! ' You know what it means--'My heart sustains me . ' Yes -- and you know why his heart is so strong ? Because it is made of stone ! A stone heart can sustain anything!--it is hard and firm and cold -- no rain , no tears can soften it!--no flowers ever grow on it -- it does not beat -- it feels nothing -- nothing!"--and
146562	146621	146464	146464	she	121	" It is not like MY heart ! my heart burns and aches -- it is a foolish heart , and my brain is a foolish brain -- I can not think with it -- it is all dark and confused ! And I have no one to help me -- I am all alone in the world ! "
146622	146625	146627	146627	Robin	126	" Innocent ! "
146628	146696	146627	146627	Robin	126	passionately--"Oh , my love , my darling!--try to recall your dear wandering mind ! You are here in the old home you used to love so well -- you are not alone -- you never shall be alone any more . I am with you to love you and take care of you -- I have loved you always -- I shall love you till I die ! "
146706	146744	146697	146697	She	2585	" Robin!--It is Robin!--you poor boy ! You always talked like that!--but you must not love me,--I have no love to give you -- I would make you happy if I could , but I can not ! "
146763	146772	146773	146773	she	2585	" Would you take me somewhere to sleep ? "
146774	146815	146816	146816	Her	2585	murmured--"I am very tired ! And when he comes you will wake me -- I will not keep him a moment waiting ! Tell him I am quite well -- and that I knew he did not mean to be unkind-- "
146859	146866	146867	146867	he	126	" What is to be done ? "
146868	146875	146849	146849	He	126	asked,--"Shall I go for the doctor ? "
146881	146889	146890	146890	she	121	" The doctor would be no use , "
146891	146957	146963	146963	he	126	answered--"She 's just fairly worn out and wants rest . Her little room is ready,--I've kept it aired , and the bed made warm and cosy ever since she went away -- lest she should ever come back sudden like ... could you carry her up , d'ye think ? She 'll be better in her bed -- and she would come to herself quicker . "
147080	147085	147086	147086	he	126	" Amadis de Jocelyn ! "
147087	147137	147086	147086	he	126	muttered--"A curse on him ! Why should the founder of this house bring evil on us?--Rising up like a ghost to overshadow us and spoil our happiness?--Let the house perish and all its traditions if it must be so , rather than that she should suffer!--for she is innocent ! "

147234	147276	147223	147223	He	126	" No , no ! She could only bring joy wherever she went -- no matter who her parents were , or how she was born , my poor little one!--she has suffered for no fault at all of her own ! "
147338	147345	147346	147346	she	121	" Cheer up , Mister Robin ! "
147350	147458	147346	147346	she	121	" She is much better -- she knows where she is now , bless her heart!--and she 's glad to be at home . Let her alone -- and if she ' as a good sleep she 'll be a'most herself again in the morning . I 'll leave my bedroom door open all night -- an ' I 'll be lookin ' in at ' er when she does n't know it , watchin ' her lovin' like for all I 'm worth ! ... so do n't ye worry , my lad!--there 's a good God in Heaven an ' it 'll all come right ! "
147474	147482	147483	147483	he	126	" Bless you , you dear woman ! "
147488	147505	147483	147483	he	126	" Do you really think so ? Will she be herself again?--our own dear little Innocent ? "
147506	147512	147514	147514	Priscilla	121	" Of course she will ! "
147521	147542	147520	147520	her	121	eyes--"An ' you 'll mebbe win ' er yet!--The Lord 's ways are ever wonderful an ' past findin ' out-- "
147553	147558	147598	147598	She	121	" Priscilla ! Robin ! "
147605	147613	147614	147614	she	121	" Only to say good - night ! "
147615	147652	147598	147598	She	121	said,--"I know just where I am now!--it was so foolish of me to forget ! I am at home -- and this is Briar Farm -- and I feel almost well and -- happy ! Robin ! "
147671	147678	147679	147679	she	121	" That 's my true knight ! "
147682	147703	147679	147679	she	121	" Dear Robin ! You deserve everything good -- and if it will give you joy I will marry you ! "
147704	147708	147709	147709	he	2598	" Marry me ! "
147715	147725	147679	147679	she	121	ears--"Innocent ! You will?--Dearest little love , you will ? "
147741	147767	147726	147726	She	121	" Yes -- I will!--To please you and Dad!--Tomorrow if you like ! But you must say good - night now and let me sleep ! "
147774	147781	147768	147768	He	2598	" Good - night , sweet ! "
147791	147817	147818	147818	She	121	" He said that once,--and once -- in a letter -- he wrote it . It seemed to me beautiful!--'Good - night , sweet ! ' "
147828	147833	147835	147835	she	121	" Good - night ! "
147836	147852	147782	147782	She	121	said--"Do not be anxious about me -- I shall sleep well ! Good - night ! "
147872	147882	147884	147884	Robin	126	" Does she mean it , do you think ? "
147889	147897	147884	147884	Robin	126	Priscilla--"Will she marry me , after all ? "
147898	147904	147906	147908	the old woman	2564	" I should n't wonder ! "
147910	147941	147906	147908	the old woman	2564	sagaciously--"Let her sleep on it , lad!--an ' you sleep on it , too!--The storm 's nigh over -- an ' mebbe our dark cloud ' as a silver lining ! "
148269	148281	148282	148282	he	84	" For , after all , I am only a farmer , "
148283	148355	148282	148282	he	84	said--"And with the friends she has made for herself she might marry any one ! The best way for me will be to give her time -- time to recover from this -- this terrible trouble she seems to have on her mind -- this curse of that fancy for Amadis de Jocelyn!--by Heaven , I 'd kill him without a minute 's grace if I had him in my power ! "
148468	148481	148482	148482	he	84	" Just now she hardly knows what she is saying or doing , "
148485	148553	148482	148482	he	84	sadly--"Some great disappointment has broken her spirit and she is wounded and in pain,--but when she is quite herself and has mastered her grief , she will see things in a different light -- she will realise the fame she has won,--the brilliant name she has made -- yes!--she must think of all this -- she must not wrong herself or injure her position by marrying me !
