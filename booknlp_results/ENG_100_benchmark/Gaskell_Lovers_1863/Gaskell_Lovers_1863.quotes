They had each purchases to make after their sales were effected , as sales of butter and eggs were effected in those days by the market - women sitting on the steps of the great old mutilated cross till a certain hour in the afternoon , after which , if all their goods were not disposed of , they took them unwillingly to the shops and sold them at a lower price . But good housewives did not despise coming themselves to the Butter Cross , and , smelling and depreciating the articles they wanted , kept up a perpetual struggle of words , trying , often in vain , to beat down prices . A housekeeper of the last century would have thought that she did not know her business , if she had not gone through this preliminary process ; and the farmers '

Again , this was denied by those who averred that Coulson was no blood relation , and that if the Fosters had intended to do anything considerable for Hester , they would never have allowed her and her mother to live in such a sparing way , ekeing out their small income by having Coulson and Hepburn for lodgers . No ; John and Jeremiah would leave all their money to some hospital or to some charitable institution . But , of course , there was a reply to this ; when are there not many sides to an argument about a possibility concerning which no facts are known ? Part of the reply turned on this : the old gentlemen had , probably , some deep plan in their heads in permitting their cousin to take Coulson and Hepburn as lodgers , the one a kind of nephew , the other , though so young , the head man in the shop ; if either of them took a fancy to Hester , how agreeably matters could be arranged !

It had been done , as he would himself have owned , to spite himself as well as them ; for it had obliged him to leave a sea - life , to which , in comparison , all life spent on shore was worse than nothing for dulness . For Robson had never reached that rank aboard ship which made his being unable to run up the rigging , or to throw a harpoon , or to fire off a gun , of no great consequence ; so he had to be thankful that an opportune legacy enabled him to turn farmer , a great degradation in his opinion . But his blood warmed , as he told the specksioneer , towards a sailor , and he pressed Kinraid to beguile the time when he was compelled to be ashore , by coming over to see him at Haytersbank , whenever he felt inclined .

53176	53319	53415	53415	he	199	' standing ; and then , her anger quenching her incipient regard , she went about her daily business pretty much as though he had never been . He had gone away out of her sight into the thick mist of unseen life from which he had emerged gone away without a word , and she might never see him again . But still there was a chance of her seeing him when he came to marry Molly Corney . Perhaps she should be bridesmaid , and then what a pleasant merry time the wedding - day would be ! The Corneys were all such kind people , and in their family there never seemed to be the checks and restraints by which her own mother hedged her round . Then there came an overwhelming self - reproaching burst of love for that '
53322	53378	53415	53415	he	199	' ; a humiliation before her slightest wish , as penance for the moment 's unspoken treason ; and thus Sylvia was led to request her cousin Philip to resume his lessons in so meek a manner , that he slowly and graciously acceded to a request which he was yearning to fulfil all the time .
53751	53777	53741	53741	Molly	195	' Why , Sylvia , is that thee ! Why , how thou'rt growed , to be sure ! What a bonny lass thou is ! '

56349	56354	56356	56356	Hester	199	' But do you ? '
56371	56379	56356	56356	Hester	199	' There 's no need for talking o '
56383	56390	56356	56356	Hester	199	' he answered , with abrupt displeasure .

56735	56815	56718	56719	her mother	796	' and if blamed for her carelessness by her parents , Sylvia was always as penitent as she could be for the time being . To be sure , it was only to her father and mother that she remained the same as she had been when an awkward lassie of thirteen . Out of the house there were the most contradictory opinions of her , especially if the voices of women were to be listened to . She was '
56823	56825	56833	56833	i	0	' ; '
56834	56841	56842	56842	her	2422	' June , and as sweet i '
56846	56854	56855	56855	she	2422	' honeysuckle a - climbing round it ; '
56857	56873	56874	56874	she	2422	' a vixen , with a tongue sharp enough to make yer very heart bleed ; '
56876	56881	56874	56874	she	2422	' just a bit o '
56887	57079	56884	56884	she	2422	' she was sulky , lively , witty , silent , affectionate , or cold - hearted , according to the person who spoke about her . In fact , her peculiarity seemed to be this that every one who knew her talked about her either in praise or blame ; in church , or in market , she unconsciously attracted attention ; they could not forget her presence , as they could that of other girls perhaps more personally attractive . Now all this was a cause of anxiety to her mother , who began to feel as if she would rather have had her child passed by in silence than so much noticed . Bell 's opinion was , that it was creditable to a woman to go through life in the shadow of obscurity , never named except in connexion with good housewifery , husband , or children . Too much talking about a girl , even in the way of praise , disturbed Mrs. Robson 's opinion of her ; and when her neighbours told her how her own daughter was admired , she would reply coldly , '
57086	57628	57080	57080	She	2423	' and change the subject of conversation . But it was quite different with her husband . To his looser , less - restrained mind , it was agreeable to hear of , and still more to see , the attention which his daughter 's beauty received . He felt it as reflecting consequence on himself . He had never troubled his mind with speculations as to whether he himself was popular , still less whether he was respected . He was pretty welcome wherever he went , as a jovial good - natured man , who had done adventurous and illegal things in his youth , which in some measure entitled him to speak out his opinions on life in general in the authoritative manner he generally used ; but , of the two , he preferred consorting with younger men , to taking a sober stand of respectability with the elders of the place ; and he perceived , without reasoning upon it , that the gay daring spirits were more desirous of his company when Sylvia was by his side than at any other time . One or two of these would saunter up to Haytersbank on a Sunday afternoon , and lounge round his fields with the old farmer . Bell kept herself from the nap which had been her weekly solace for years , in order to look after Sylvia , and on such occasions she always turned as cold a shoulder to the visitors as her sense of hospitality and of duty to her husband would permit . But if they did not enter the house , old Robson would always have Sylvia with him when he went the round of his land . Bell could see them from the upper window : the young men standing in the attitudes of listeners , while Daniel laid down the law on some point , enforcing his words by pantomimic actions with his thick stick ; and Sylvia , half turning away as if from some too admiring gaze , was possibly picking flowers out of the hedge - bank . These Sunday afternoon strolls were the plague of Bell 's life that whole summer . Then it took as much of artifice as was in the simple woman 's nature to keep Daniel from insisting on having Sylvia 's company every time he went down to Monkshaven . And here , again , came a perplexity , the acknowledgement of which in distinct thought would have been an act of disloyalty , according to Bell 's conscience . If Sylvia went with her father , he never drank to excess ; and that was a good gain to health at any rate drinking was hardly a sin against morals in those days , and in that place ; so , occasionally , she was allowed to accompany him to Monkshaven as a check upon his folly ; for he was too fond and proud of his daughter to disgrace her by any open excess . But one Sunday afternoon early in November , Philip came up before the time at which he usually paid his visits . He looked grave and pale ; and his aunt began ,
57629	57668	56884	56884	she	2422	' Why , lad ! what 's been ado ? Thou'rt looking as peaked and pined as a Methody preacher after a love - feast , when he 's talked hisself to Death 's door . Thee dost na '

57738	57741	57743	57743	Philip	199	' Oh , '

71803	71875	71801	71801	master	7826	' said Kinraid , with easy freedom a freedom which Philip envied , but could not have imitated , although he was deeply disappointed at the loss of his walk with Sylvia , when he had intended to exercise the power his aunt had delegated to him of remonstrance if her behaviour had been light or thoughtless , and of warning if he saw cause to disapprove of any of her associates .
72043	72052	72035	72035	she	248	' A shall take it very unkind if yo '
72055	72435	72035	72035	she	248	' ; but somehow she could not say this , for in truth Philip 's look showed that he would be but a wet blanket on the merriment of the party . So , with as much civility as could be mustered up between them , he took leave . Shutting the door behind him , he went out into the dreary night , and began his lonesome walk back to Monkshaven . The cold sleet almost blinded him as the sea - wind drove it straight in his face ; it cut against him as it was blown with drifting force . The roar of the wintry sea came borne on the breeze ; there was more light from the whitened ground than from the dark laden sky above . The field - paths would have been a matter of perplexity , had it not been for the well - known gaps in the dyke - side , which showed the whitened land beyond , between the two dark stone walls . Yet he went clear and straight along his way , having unconsciously left all guidance to the animal instinct which co - exists with the human soul , and sometimes takes strange charge of the human body , when all the nobler powers of the individual are absorbed in acute suffering . At length he was in the lane , toiling up the hill , from which , by day , Monkshaven might be seen . Now all features of the landscape before him were lost in the darkness of night , against which the white flakes came closer and nearer , thicker and faster . On a sudden , the bells of Monkshaven church rang out a welcome to the new year , 1796 . From the direction of the wind , it seemed as if the sound was flung with strength and power right into Philip 's face . He walked down the hill to its merry sound its merry sound , his heavy heart . As he entered the long High Street of Monkshaven he could see the watching lights put out in parlour , chamber , or kitchen . The new year had come , and expectation was ended . Reality had begun .
72614	72637	72638	72638	He	199	' A happy new year to you , Philip , and may God have you in his keeping all the days thereof ! '
72817	72822	72806	72806	Coulson	199	' , and Philip replied ,
72823	72835	72806	72806	Coulson	199	' Not much ; such parties are noane to my liking . '
72836	72844	72806	72806	Coulson	199	' And yet thou broke off from t '
72852	72852	72806	72806	Coulson	199	'

72925	72938	72953	72953	he	199	' Sodom , pleasant to look at , but ashes to taste . '

73075	73277	73073	73074	the Corneys	247	' kitchen and the scenes that had taken place in it , passing like a pageant before his closed eyes . Then he opened them in angry weariness at the recurring vision , and tried to make out the outlines of the room and the furniture in the darkness . The white ceiling sloped into the whitewashed walls , and against them he could see the four rush - bottomed chairs , the looking - glass hung on one side , the old carved oak - chest his own property , with the initials of forgotten ancestors cut upon it , which held his clothes ; the boxes that belonged to Coulson , sleeping soundly in the bed in the opposite corner of the room ; the casement window in the roof , through which the snowy ground on the steep hill - side could be plainly seen ; and when he got so far as this in the catalogue of the room , he fell into a troubled feverish sleep , which lasted two or three hours ; and then he awoke with a start , and a consciousness of uneasiness , though what about he could not remember at first .

75500	75708	75476	75476	He	199	' had exhibited . But then he felt stirring within him a force of enduring love which he believed to be unusual , and which seemed as if it must compel all things to his wish in the end . A year or so ago he had thought much of his own cleverness and his painfully acquired learning , and he had imagined that these were the qualities which were to gain Sylvia . But now , whether he had tried them and had failed to win even her admiration , or whether some true instinct had told him that a woman 's love may be gained in many ways sooner than by mere learning , he was only angry with himself for his past folly in making himself her school nay , her taskmaster . To - night , though , he would start off on a new tack . He would not even upbraid her for her conduct the night before ; he had shown her his displeasure at the time ; but she should see how tender and forgiving he could be . He would lure her to him rather than find fault with her . There had perhaps been too much of that already .

84425	84428	84346	84346	Kester	229	' addressing Sylvia .

84450	84453	84448	84448	her	196	' said Kester .

84471	84476	84478	84478	Sylvia	196	' To - morrow ! '

84771	84773	84748	84748	he	229	' T '
84779	84839	84748	84748	he	229	' said he ; but he grinned to himself , and looked about , and listened to the hearsay of every lad , wondering who was handsome , and brave , and good enough to be Sylvia 's mate . Now , of late , it had seemed to the canny farm - servant pretty clear that Philip Hepburn was '
84842	84974	84748	84748	he	229	' ; and to Philip , Kester had an instinctive objection , a kind of natural antipathy such as has existed in all ages between the dwellers in a town and those in the country , between agriculture and trade . So , while Kinraid and Sylvia kept up their half - tender , half - jesting conversation , Kester was making up his slow persistent mind as to the desirability of the young man then present as a husband for his darling , as much from his being other than Philip in every respect , as from the individual good qualities he possessed . Kester 's first opportunity of favouring Kinraid 's suit consisted in being as long as possible over his milking ; so never were cows that required such '
84977	84984	84748	84748	he	229	' or were expected to yield such '
84986	85134	85193	85193	she	3135	' , as Black Nell and Daisy that night . But all things must come to an end ; and at length Kester got up from his three - legged stool , on seeing what the others did not that the dip - candle in the lantern was coming to an end and that in two or three minutes more the shippen would be in darkness , and so his pails of milk be endangered . In an instant Sylvia had started out of her delicious dreamland , her drooping eyes were raised , and recovered their power of observation ; her ruddy arms were freed from the apron in which she had enfolded them , as a protection from the gathering cold , and she had seized and adjusted the wooden yoke across her shoulders , ready to bear the brimming milk - pails to the dairy .
85135	85138	85140	85140	her	3135	' Look yo '
85142	85158	85159	85159	She	3135	' exclaimed Kester to Charley , as he adjusted the fragrant pails on the yoke . '

89410	89532	89574	89575	Mark Alderson	337	' shop , and later hours were kept than usual . Some perplexity or other was occupying John and Jeremiah Foster ; their minds were not so much on the alert as usual , being engaged on some weighty matter of which they had as yet spoken to no one . But it thus happened that they did not give the prompt assistance they were accustomed to render at such times ; and Coulson had been away on some of the new expeditions devolving on him and Philip as future partners . One evening after the shop was closed , while they were examining the goods , and comparing the sales with the entries in the day - book , Coulson suddenly inquired

But , if he had done so , it would have been locking the stable - door after the steed was stolen . Kinraid had turned his steps towards Haytersbank Farm as soon as ever he had completed his purchases . He had only come that afternoon to Monkshaven , and for the sole purpose of seeing Sylvia once more before he went to fulfil his engagement as specksioneer in the Urania , a whaling - vessel that was to sail from North Shields on Thursday morning , and this was Monday .

Neither could keep quiet and silent long . She felt his eyes were upon her , watching every motion , and grew more and more confused in her expression and behaviour . He was a little taken aback by the nature of his reception , and was not sure at first whether to take the great change in her manner , from what it had been when last he saw her , as a favourable symptom or otherwise . By - and - by , luckily for him , in some turn of her arm to reach the scissors on the table , she caught the edge of her work - basket , and down it fell . She stooped to pick up the scattered stockings and ball of worsted , and so did he ; and when they rose up , he had fast hold of her hand , and her face was turned away , half ready to cry .

He would speak to her of his passionate attachment , before he left , for an uncertain length of time , and the certain distance of London . And all the modification on this point which his judgment could obtain from his impetuous and excited heart was , that he would watch her words and manner well when he announced his approaching absence , and if in them he read the slightest token of tender regretful feeling , he would pour out his love at her feet , not even urging the young girl to make any return , or to express the feelings of which he hoped the germ was already budding in her . He would be patient with her ; he could not be patient himself . His heart beating , his busy mind rehearsing the probable coming scene , he turned into the field - path that led to Haytersbank . Coming along it , and so meeting him , advanced Daniel Robson , in earnest talk with Charley Kinraid . Kinraid , then , had been at the farm : Kinraid had been seeing Sylvia , her mother away . The thought of poor dead Annie Coulson flashed into Philip 's mind . Could he be playing the same game with Sylvia ? Philip set his teeth and tightened his lips at the thought of it . They had stopped talking ; they had seen him already , or his impulse would have been to dodge behind the wall and avoid them ; even though one of his purposes in going to Haytersbank had been to bid his uncle farewell .

But by the farm , by the very house - door they must of necessity pass . Philip slackened his pace , keeping under the shadow of the rock . By - and - by Kinraid , walking on the sunlight open sands , turned round and looked long and earnestly towards Haytersbank gully . Hepburn paused when he paused , but as intently as he looked at some object above , so intently did Hepburn look at him . No need to ascertain by sight towards whom his looks , his thoughts were directed . He took off his hat and waved it , touching one part of it as if with particular meaning . When he turned away at last , Hepburn heaved a heavy sigh , and crept yet more into the cold dank shadow of the cliffs . Each step was now a heavy task , his sad heart tired and weary . After a while he climbed up a few feet , so as to mingle his form yet more completely with the stones and rocks around . Stumbling over the uneven and often jagged points , slipping on the sea - weed , plunging into little pools of water left by the ebbing tide in some natural basins , he yet kept his eyes fixed as if in fascination on Kinraid , and made his way almost alongside of him . But the last hour had pinched Hepburn 's features into something of the wan haggardness they would wear when he should first be lying still for ever .

They were speaking of that very Kinraid , the thought of whom filled his own mind like an actual presence .

It was late , it is true , but on a May evening even country people keep up till eight or nine o'clock . Perhaps it was because Hepburn was still in his travel - stained dress ; having gone straight to the shop on his arrival in Monkshaven . Perhaps it was because , if he went this night for the short half - hour intervening before bed - time , he would have no excuse for paying a longer visit on the following evening . At any rate , he proceeded straight to Alice Rose 's , as soon as he had finished his interview with his employers .

She was out of doors , in the garden , which , at some distance from the house , sloped up the bank on the opposite side of the gully ; much too far off to be spoken to not too far off to be gazed at by eyes that caressed her every movement . How well Philip knew that garden ; placed long ago by some tenant of the farm on a southern slope ; walled in with rough moorland stones ; planted with berry - bushes for use , and southernwood and sweet - briar for sweetness of smell . When the Robsons had first come to Haytersbank , and Sylvia was scarcely more than a pretty child , how well he remembered helping her with the arrangement of this garden ; laying out his few spare pence in hen - and - chicken daisies at one time , in flower - seeds at another ; again in a rose - tree in a pot . He knew how his unaccustomed hands had laboured with the spade at forming a little primitive bridge over the beck in the hollow before winter streams should make it too deep for fording ; how he had cut down branches of the mountain - ash and covered them over , yet decked with their scarlet berries , with sods of green turf , beyond which the brilliancy crept out ; but now it was months and years since he had been in that garden , which had lost its charm for Sylvia , as she found the bleak sea - winds came up and blighted all endeavours at cultivating more than the most useful things pot - herbs , marigolds , potatoes , onions , and such - like . Why did she tarry there now , standing quite motionless up by the highest bit of wall , looking over the sea , with her hand shading her eyes ? Quite motionless ; as if she were a stone statue . He began to wish she would move would look at him but any way that she would move , and not stand gazing thus over that great dreary sea .

Thee and Coulson should have a try for Hester , Philip . I have told Coulson this day of Hester 's chances . I told him first because he is my wife 's nephew ; but I tell thee now , Philip . It would be a good thing for the shop if one of ye was married . '

But , no ! she would have none of him , but set her heart on Jack Rose , a sailor in a whale - ship . And so they were married at last , though all her own folks were against it . And he was a profligate sinner , and went after other women , and drank , and beat her . She turned as stiff and as grey as thou seest her now within a year of Hester 's birth . I believe they 'd have perished for want and cold many a time if it had not been for John . If she ever guessed where the money came from , it must have hurt her pride above a bit , for she was always a proud woman . But mother 's love is stronger than pride . '

It was time that he should change his tactics ; for the girl was becoming weary of the necessity for thanking him , every time he came , for some little favour or other . She wished he would let her alone and not watch her continually with such sad eyes .

The shops were almost deserted ; there was no unnecessary expenditure by the men ; they dared not venture out to buy lavish presents for the wife or sweetheart or little children .

No more silence , no more dead opposition : a living struggle , a glowing , raging fight ; and Daniel thought he should be obliged to sit there still , leaning against the wall , inactive , while the strife and the action were going on in which he had once been foremost .

131823	132416	132636	132636	his	374	' And now she sate down , and wept the dry hot tears that come with such difficulty to the eyes of the aged . And so first one grieving , and then the other , and each draining her own heart of every possible hope by way of comfort , alternately trying to cheer and console the February afternoon passed away ; the continuous rain closing in the daylight even earlier than usual , and adding to the dreariness , with the natural accompaniments of wailing winds , coming with long sweeps over the moors , and making the sobbings at the windows that always sound like the gasps of some one in great agony . Meanwhile Philip had hastened back to Monkshaven . He had no umbrella , he had to face the driving rain for the greater part of the way ; but he was thankful to the weather , for it kept men indoors , and he wanted to meet no one , but to have time to think and mature his plans . The town itself was , so to speak , in mourning . The rescue of the sailors was a distinctly popular movement ; the subsequent violence which had , indeed , gone much further than has been described , after Daniel left it was , in general , considered as only a kind of due punishment inflicted in wild justice on the press - gang and their abettors . The feeling of the Monkshaven people was , therefore , in decided opposition to the vigorous steps taken by the county magistrates , who , in consequence of an appeal from the naval officers in charge of the impressment service , had called out the militia from a distant and inland county stationed within a few miles , and had thus summarily quenched the riots that were continuing on the Sunday morning after a somewhat languid fashion ; the greater part of the destruction of property having been accomplished during the previous night . Still there was little doubt but that the violence would have been renewed as evening drew on , and the more desperate part of the population and the enraged sailors had had the Sabbath leisure to brood over their wrongs , and to encourage each other in a passionate attempt at redress , or revenge . So the authorities were quite justified in the decided steps they had taken , both in their own estimation then , and now , in ours , looking back on the affair in cold blood . But at the time feeling ran strongly against them ; and all means of expressing itself in action being prevented , men brooded sullenly in their own houses . Philip , as the representative of the family , the head of which was now suffering for his deeds in the popular cause , would have met with more sympathy , ay , and more respect than he imagined , as he went along the streets , glancing from side to side , fearful of meeting some who would shy him as the relation of one who had been ignominiously taken to Bridewell a few hours before . But in spite of this wincing of Philip 's from observation and remark , he never dreamed of acting otherwise than as became a brave true friend . And this he did , and would have done , from a natural faithfulness and constancy of disposition , without any special regard for Sylvia .

133207	133278	133293	133293	Philip	199	' Why , hang him , to be sure ; if the judge is in a hanging mood . He 's been either a principal in the offence , or a principal in the second degree , and , as such , liable to the full punishment .

I 'm
133494	133517	133634	133635	Mr. Donkin	374	'm sure ; but I can not help thinking as Daniel had a deal to justify him on Saturday night , sir . '
133518	133592	133357	133357	you	4513	' Well ; you must try and get a good lawyer to bring out all that side of the question . There 's a good deal to be said on it ; but it 's my duty to get up all the evidence to prove that he and others were present on the night in question ; so , as you 'll perceive , I can give you no help in defending him . '
133593	133633	133663	133663	he	374	' But who can , sir ? I came to you as a friend who , I thought , would see me through it . And I do n't know any other lawyer ; leastways , to speak to . '
133681	133810	133847	133848	Mr. Donkin	374	' You 'd better go to Edward Dawson on the other side of the river ; he that was articled clerk with me two years ago , you know . He 's a clever fellow , and has not too much practice ; he 'll do the best he can for you . He 'll have to be at the court - house , tell him , to - morrow morning at ten , when the justices meet . He 'll watch the case for you ; and then he 'll give you his opinion , and tell you what to do . You ca n't do better than follow his advice . I must do all I can to collect evidence for a conviction , you know . '

In her keen agony she read his thoughts as though they were an open page ; she sate there , upright and stony , the conviction creeping over her face like the grey shadow of death . No more tears , no more trembling , almost no more breathing . He could not bear to see her , and yet she held his eyes , and he feared to make the effort necessary to move or to turn away , lest the shunning motion should carry conviction to her heart . Alas ! conviction of the probable danger to her father 's life was already there : it was that that was calming her down , tightening her muscles , bracing her nerves . In that hour she lost all her early youth .

Every time she sate down to look at the sea , this process of thought was gone through up to this point ; the next step would , she knew , bring her to the question she dared not , must not ask . He was dead ; he must be dead ; for was she not Philip 's wife ? Then came up the recollection of Philip 's speech , never forgotten , only buried out of sight : '
167279	167290	167278	167278	yo	5370	' to go on dreaming of another man , and yo '
167295	167664	168042	168042	we	5384	' She used to shudder as if cold steel had been plunged into her warm , living body as she remembered these words ; cruel words , harmlessly provoked . They were too much associated with physical pains to be dwelt upon ; only their memory was always there . She paid for these happy rambles with her baby by the depression which awaited her on her re - entrance into the dark , confined house that was her home ; its very fulness of comfort was an oppression . Then , when her husband saw her pale and fatigued , he was annoyed , and sometimes upbraided her for doing what was so unnecessary as to load herself with her child . She knew full well it was not that that caused her weariness . By - and - by , when he inquired and discovered that all these walks were taken in one direction , out towards the sea , he grew jealous of her love for the inanimate ocean . Was it connected in her mind with the thought of Kinraid ? Why did she so perseveringly , in wind or cold , go out to the sea - shore ; the western side , too , where , if she went but far enough , she would come upon the mouth of the Haytersbank gully , the point at which she had last seen Kinraid ? Such fancies haunted Philip 's mind for hours after she had acknowledged the direction of her walks . But he never said a word that could distinctly tell her he disliked her going to the sea , otherwise she would have obeyed him in this , as in everything else ; for absolute obedience to her husband seemed to be her rule of life at this period obedience to him who would so gladly have obeyed her smallest wish had she but expressed it ! She never knew that Philip had any painful association with the particular point on the sea - shore that she instinctively avoided , both from a consciousness of wifely duty , and also because the sight of it brought up so much sharp pain .

They thought he was dead himself , you see , as he was very near ; and would have been too , if your husband had not come out of shelter , and taken him up in his arms or on his back I could n't make out which , and carried him safe within the walls .

207658	207692	207812	207812	Sylvia	196	' You see , because he could n't find him alive is no reason for giving him up as dead ; because his name was n't to be found on any of the ships '
