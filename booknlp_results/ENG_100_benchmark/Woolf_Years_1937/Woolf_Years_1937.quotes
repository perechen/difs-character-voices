37693	37698	37682	37682	she	276	" That 'll do . "
37738	37750	37751	37751	she	276	" I shall be late as it is , Mrs Lamley , "
37832	37841	37843	37844	the Colonel	583	" Miss Eleanor wo n't be a minute , "

37883	37891	37892	37892	he	583	" I do n't see why not , "
38007	38012	38013	38013	he	583	" Here she is , "
38126	38133	38134	38134	he	583	" Hullo , what 's that ? "
38142	38149	38150	38150	she	276	" Maggie 's present , Papa , "
38153	38171	38150	38150	she	276	" The best I could do . . . . I 'm afraid it 's rather cheap . "

38190	38197	38198	38198	he	583	" Just what she 'll like , "
38233	38359	38225	38225	She	276	" as she put it to herself . What did you spin things round on ? she wondered , helping herself to bread sauce - a pivot ? The scene had changed so often that morning ; and every scene required a different adjustment ; bringing this to the front ; sinking that to the depths . And now she felt nothing ; hungry merely ; merely a chicken - eater ; blank . But as she ate , the sense of her father imposed itself . She liked his solidity , as he sat opposite her munching his chicken methodically . What had he been doing , she wondered . Taking shares out of one company and putting them in another ? He roused himself .
38360	38368	38369	38369	he	1716	" Well , how was the Committee ? "
38382	38402	38403	38403	he	1716	" That 's right . Stand up to 'em , Nell . Do n't let yourself be sat on , "
38509	38516	38517	38517	she	1717	" I shall have to hurry , "
38520	38535	38537	38538	the Colonel	583	" Ah , but these lawyer chaps always know how to spin things out , "
38540	38546	38537	38538	the Colonel	583	" Who 's the Judge ? "
38547	38551	38553	38553	Eleanor	276	" Sanders Curry , "
38563	38567	38561	38561	Domesday	335	" said the Colonel .
38568	38576	38577	38577	he	583	" Which Court 's he sitting in ? "
38585	38590	38592	38593	the Colonel	583	" Here , Crosby - "
38641	38652	38653	38653	she	276	" And you 're going to the City , Papa ? "
38662	38669	38670	38670	he	583	" Yes . To a meeting , "
38685	38697	38698	38698	she	276	" Odd it should be Curry who 's trying the case , "
38722	38728	38729	38729	she	276	" D'you remember that party ? "
38735	38740	38729	38729	she	276	" The old oak ? "
38746	38752	38754	38755	her father	643	" All shams I suspect , "
38757	38762	38763	38763	he	583	" Do n't hurry , "
38766	38779	38780	38780	he	583	" Take a cab , Nell - if you want any change - "
38818	38823	38824	38824	she	276	" Well , then , "
38831	38838	38824	38824	she	276	" we shall meet at tea . "
38839	38842	38843	38843	he	583	" No , "
38847	38857	38843	38843	he	583	" I 'm going round by the Digbys ' . "
38878	38889	38890	38890	he	583	" And what about a box for this , eh ? "
38893	38903	38905	38905	Eleanor	276	" Crosby , find a box for the necklace , "
38920	38927	38928	38928	she	276	" It 'll be dinner then , "
38952	38957	38958	38958	he	583	" Yes , dinner , "
39011	39020	39021	39021	she	276	" And give my love to Aunt Eugénie , "
39322	39328	39329	39329	she	276	" We started at dawn , "
39376	39391	39372	39372	She	276	" I found myself alone in the middle of the jungle . . . . "
39443	39456	39457	39457	she	276	" I had lost my way ; and the sun was sinking , "
39460	39468	39469	39469	Eleanor	276	" The sun was sinking . . . "
39528	39539	39541	39541	he	205	" I thought it better to stay where I was . "
39594	39617	39618	39618	She	276	" I looked in my pocket and found that I had only two matches . . . The first match went out . "
39634	39650	39626	39626	Martin	205	" Then I lit the other , and by sheer luck it did the trick . "
39682	39696	39668	39668	She	276	" once I thought I heard voices shouting , but they died away . "
39697	39702	39704	39704	Eleanor	276	" They died away ! "
39734	39739	39740	39740	she	1285	" They died away , "

46509	46551	46552	46552	She	225	" he lets everybody else take a holiday , but he never takes one himself . And then , when he 's done a full day 's work at the office , he comes back with his bag full of papers - "
46558	46566	46568	46568	Abel	191	" You should n't work after dinner , "
46570	46577	46568	46568	Abel	191	" That 's a bad habit . "

56488	56497	56486	56486	Martin	205	" But he was such a damned snob . "
56498	56504	56506	56506	Eleanor	276	" Only on the surface , "
56508	56519	56520	56520	Martin	205	" And always finding fault with Eugénie about little things , "
56523	56531	56533	56533	Eleanor	276	" But think of living with her , "
56535	56539	56540	56540	She	276	" That manner - "
56558	56563	56564	56564	he	205	" I liked her , "
56567	56573	56564	56564	he	205	" I liked going there . "
56604	56615	56616	56616	she	276	" What a pleasure , Martin ! what a pleasure ! "
56644	56651	56652	56652	he	205	" Was n't there some story , "
56655	56660	56652	56652	he	205	" about a letter ? "
56718	56721	56722	56722	she	276	" Yes , "
56725	56731	56722	56722	she	276	" There was a story - "
56743	56746	56747	56747	she	276	" Papa , "
56754	56757	56759	56759	Martin	205	" No , "
56761	56766	56759	56759	Martin	205	" I 'll go . "
56771	56780	56767	56767	He	205	" I promised him a game of chess . "
56781	56791	56793	56793	Eleanor	276	" Thanks , Martin . He 'll enjoy that , "
56914	56932	56899	56899	he	205	" A man of singularly handsome presence . . . shot , fished , and played golf . "
57691	57696	57697	57697	she	276	" Hullo , Rose ! "
57709	57717	57697	57697	she	276	" I thought you were in Northumberland ! "
57718	57726	57727	57727	Rose	204	" You thought I was in Northumberland ! "
57733	57742	57727	57727	Rose	204	" But why ? I said the eighteenth . "
57743	57751	57753	57753	Eleanor	276	" But is n't today the eleventh ? "
57755	57767	57769	57769	Martin	205	" You 're only a week behind the times , Nell , "
57771	57782	57783	57783	Eleanor	276	" Then I must have dated all my letters wrong ! "
57811	57816	57817	57817	she	276	" Tea , Rose ? "
57820	57830	57832	57832	Rose	204	" No . It 's a bath I want , "
57847	57854	57856	57856	Eleanor	276	" You 're looking very well , "
57873	57882	57883	57883	Martin	205	" A positive beauty , is n't she ? "
57950	57956	57957	57957	Rose	204	" I want a bath , "
57960	57971	57972	57972	she	204	" I 'm dirty . And what 's all this ? "
57984	57990	57991	57991	she	204	" Oh , Uncle Digby , "
58014	58023	58025	58025	Eleanor	276	" Martin says the house has been sold , "
58027	58031	58032	58032	she	204	" Has it ? "
58048	58053	58054	58054	she	204	" Spoiling my dinner , "
58057	58066	58054	58054	she	204	" But I had no time for lunch . "
58067	58076	58077	58077	Martin	205	" What a woman of action she is ! "
58081	58086	58087	58087	Eleanor	276	" And the meetings ? "
58090	58098	58100	58100	Martin	205	" Yes . What about the North ? "
58139	58150	58151	58151	she	204	" I think we gave 'em something to think about , "
58287	58294	58295	58295	Eleanor	276	" Eleanor - ' said Rose . "
58296	58300	58295	58295	Eleanor	276	" - she repeated .
58304	58309	58311	58311	Martin	205	" Eleanor 's broody , "
58313	58324	58325	58325	she	276	" No , not at all - not at all , "
58328	58335	58325	58325	she	276	" What are you talking about ? "
58336	58342	58344	58344	Rose	204	" I was asking you , "
58346	58379	58344	58344	Rose	204	" Do you remember that row when the microscope was broken ? Well , I met that boy - that horrid , ferret- faced boy - Erridge - up in the North . "
58380	58386	58388	58388	Martin	205	" He was n't horrid , "
58390	58394	58395	58395	Rose	204	" He was , "
58398	58430	58431	58431	She	204	" A horrid little sneak . He pretended that it was I who broke the microscope and it was he who broke it . . . . D'you remember that row ? "
58436	58444	58446	58446	Eleanor	276	" I do n't remember that row , "
58448	58454	58455	58455	she	204	" There were so many , "
58458	58466	58468	58468	Martin	205	" That was one of the worst , "
58470	58474	58476	58476	Rose	204	" It was , "
58494	58501	58502	58502	she	204	" And after it was over , "
58509	58532	58502	58502	she	204	" you came up into the nursery and asked me to go beetling with you in the Round Pond . D'you remember ? "
58555	58597	58598	58598	Her	204	" And you said , ' I 'll ask you three times ; and if you do n't answer the third time , I 'll go alone . ' And I swore , ' I 'll let him go alone . ' "
58603	58609	58611	58611	Martin	205	" I can see you , "
58613	58626	58611	58611	Martin	205	" Wearing a pink frock , with a knife in your hand . "
58627	58632	58633	58633	Rose	204	" And you went , "
58642	58653	58655	58655	she	204	" And I dashed into the bathroom and cut this gash "
58726	58735	58737	58737	Martin	205	" Oh , Rose always was a firebrand ! "
58743	58753	58754	58754	he	205	" She always had the devil 's own temper , "
58808	58812	58813	58813	she	276	" Dining out ? "
58871	58877	58878	58878	he	205	" That picture wants cleaning , "
58889	58896	58897	58897	he	205	" It 's a nice picture , "
58905	58917	58897	58897	he	205	" But usen't there to be a flower in the grass ? "
58940	58944	58945	58945	she	276	" Was there ? "
58948	58956	58958	58958	Martin	205	" Yes . A little blue flower , "
58960	58974	58958	58958	Martin	205	" I can remember it when I was a child . . . . "
59057	59064	59065	59065	he	205	" What awful lives children live ! "
59079	59086	59065	59065	he	205	" Do n't they , Rose ? "
59087	59090	59092	59092	Rose	204	" Yes , "
59094	59102	59103	59103	she	204	" And they ca n't tell anybody , "
59117	59123	59125	59125	Martin	205	" Miss Pym 's conservatory ? "
59135	59139	59141	59141	Eleanor	276	" Miss Pym ? "
59143	59152	59141	59141	Eleanor	276	" She 's been dead these twenty years ! "
59855	59859	59860	59860	she	204	" Damned humbugs ! "
60294	60300	60301	60301	she	204	" Go search the valleys , "
60309	60315	60305	60305	she	204	" pluck up every rose . "
60319	60325	60326	60326	she	204	" That 's very nice , "
60390	60397	60399	60399	Maggie	316	" What are you laughing at ? "
60417	60425	60427	60427	Sara	344	" Dazed in a rapture of contemplation , "
60442	60449	60450	60450	Maggie	316	" she pointed to the table . "
60453	60463	60450	60450	Maggie	316	" she jumped up and pirouetted about the room , "
60478	60491	60450	60450	Maggie	316	" She pointed to the table upon which three places had been laid .
60492	60498	60500	60500	Maggie	316	" But we are three , "
60502	60507	60500	60500	Maggie	316	" Rose is coming . "
60515	60520	60521	60521	she	344	" Rose is coming ? "
60524	60529	60531	60531	Maggie	316	" I told you , "
60533	60562	60563	60563	she	344	" I said to you , Rose is coming to luncheon on Friday . It is Friday . And Rose is coming to luncheon . Any minute now , "
60582	60594	60595	60595	Sara	344	" It is Friday , and Rose is coming to luncheon , "
60598	60603	60605	60605	Maggie	316	" I told you , "
60607	60621	60623	60623	she	344	" I was in a shop . I was buying stuff . And somebody "
60632	60678	60679	60679	she	344	" came out from behind a counter and said , ' I 'm your cousin . I 'm Rose , ' she said . ' Can I come and see you ? Any day , any time , ' she said . So I said , "
60687	60690	60679	60679	she	344	" lunch . "
60714	60719	60720	60720	she	344	" Rose is coming , "
60723	60732	60733	60733	She	344	" and this is where she 'll sit . "
60744	60783	60733	60733	She	344	" And she 'll take off her gloves ; and she 'll lay one on this side , one on that . And she 'll say , I 've never been in this part of London before . ' "
60784	60788	60790	60790	Maggie	316	" And then ? "
60797	60811	60733	60733	She	344	" You 'll say ' It 's so convenient for the theatres . ' "
60812	60816	60818	60818	Maggie	316	" And then ? "
60820	60849	60733	60733	She	344	" And then she 'll say rather wistfully , smiling , putting her head on one side , ' D'you often go to the theatre , Maggie ? ' "
60850	60853	60855	60855	Maggie	316	" No , "
60857	60863	60855	60855	Maggie	316	" Rose has red hair . "
60864	60868	60869	60869	Sara	344	" Red hair ? "
60872	60889	60890	60890	she	344	" I thought it was grey - a little wisp straggling from under a black bonnet , "
60893	60896	60898	60898	Maggie	316	" No , "
60900	60914	60898	60898	Maggie	316	" She has a great deal of hair ; and it 's red . "
60915	60922	60923	60923	Sara	344	" Red hair ; red Rose , "
60933	60957	60898	60898	Maggie	316	" Rose of the flaming heart ; Rose of the burning breast ; Rose of the weary world - red , red Rose ! "
60970	60975	60977	60977	Maggie	316	" There she is , "
60989	61002	60983	60983	They	2405	" Still further up ? On the very top ? Thank you . "
61012	61021	61022	61022	Sara	344	" This is the worst torture . . . "
61035	61042	61022	61022	Sara	344	" that life . . . . "
61043	61051	61053	61053	Maggie	316	" Do n't be such an ass , "
61068	61076	61077	61077	she	204	" It 's ages since we met , "
61156	61169	61170	61170	she	204	" That used to stand in the hall , did n't it ? "
61181	61184	61186	61186	Maggie	316	" Yes , "
61188	61193	61195	61195	Rose	204	" And that glass - "
61212	61219	61195	61195	Rose	204	" was n't that there too ? "
61220	61223	61225	61225	Maggie	316	" Yes , "
61227	61234	61225	61225	Maggie	316	" in my mother 's bedroom . "
61248	61256	61257	61257	Rose	204	" What nice rooms you 've found ! "
61279	61289	61290	61290	she	204	" But do n't you find it rather noisy ? "
61364	61371	61373	61373	Maggie	316	" Yes , it 's noisy , "
61375	61380	61373	61373	Maggie	316	" But very convenient . "
61381	61388	61390	61390	Sara	344	" Very convenient for the theatres , "
61399	61405	61407	61407	Rose	204	" So I remember finding , "
61415	61422	61407	61407	Rose	204	" when I lived here myself . "
61423	61429	61431	61431	Maggie	316	" Did you live here ? "
61439	61443	61444	61444	she	316	" Not here , "
61447	61456	61444	61444	she	316	" Round the corner . With a friend . "
61457	61466	61468	61468	Sara	344	" We thought you lived in Abercorn Terrace , "
61470	61481	61482	61482	Rose	204	" Ca n't one live in more places than one ? "
61506	61512	61514	61514	Maggie	316	" I remember Abercorn Terrace , "
61519	61547	61516	61516	She	316	" There was a long room ; and a tree at the end ; and a picture over the fireplace , of a girl with red hair ? "
61551	61558	61559	61559	she	316	" Mama when she was young , "
61562	61571	61572	61572	Maggie	316	" And a round table in the middle ? "
61578	61590	61575	61575	Rose	204	" And you had a parlourmaid with very prominent blue eyes ? "
61591	61600	61575	61575	Rose	204	" Crosby . She 's still with us . "
61606	61610	61612	61612	Sara	344	" And then ? "
61625	61629	61631	61631	Rose	204	" And then ? "
61633	61636	61638	61638	she	204	" Well then "
61718	61729	61708	61708	she	204	" Eleanor , I want to go to Lamley 's . "
61797	61803	61805	61805	Maggie	316	" I remember Uncle Abel , "
61807	61821	61805	61805	Maggie	316	" He gave me a necklace ; a blue necklace with gold spots . "
61822	61828	61830	61830	Rose	204	" He 's still alive , "
61969	61979	61980	61980	she	204	" Do n't you find it very noisy here ? "
61983	61993	61995	61995	Sara	344	" Yes . But very convenient for the theatres , "
62090	62094	62095	62095	Maggie	316	" And Delia - "
62172	62178	62179	62179	she	316	" She married an Irishman , "
62196	62200	62201	62201	she	316	" And Edward ? "
62204	62209	62210	62210	Rose	204	" Edward . . . "
62222	62225	62226	62226	she	344	" Edward ! "
62233	62254	62255	62255	She	344	" Oh blasted eyes of my deceased wife 's sister - withered prop of my defunct old age . . . "
62261	62266	62267	62267	she	344	" That 's Edward , "
62270	62292	62267	62267	she	344	" A quotation from a book he gave me . ' My wasted youth - my wasted youth ' . . . "
62359	62374	62375	62375	she	344	" There 's not much of ' my wasted youth ' about Edward now , "
62378	62383	62385	62385	Sara	344	" I thought not , "
62443	62449	62451	62451	Maggie	316	" Go on , Rose , "
62457	62466	62451	62451	Maggie	316	" Go on telling us about the Pargiters . "
62467	62472	62474	62474	Rose	204	" About the Pargiters ? "
62488	62495	62496	62496	she	204	" What could be more ordinary ? "
62499	62512	62496	62496	she	204	" A large family , living in a large house . . . "
62533	62539	62540	62540	she	344	" It 's not ordinary , "
62543	62547	62540	62540	she	344	" The Pargiters - "
62568	62572	62573	62573	she	204	" The Pargiters , "
62576	62583	62573	62573	she	204	" going on and on and on "
62594	62602	62603	62603	she	204	" until they come to a rock , "
62606	62610	62612	62612	she	344	" and then Rose "
62624	62659	62660	62660	she	204	" - Rose claps spurs to her horse , rides straight up to a man in a gold coat , and says ' Damn your eyes ! ' Is n't that Rose , Maggie ? "
62712	62719	62721	62721	Maggie	316	" Well , that 's done , "
62728	62738	62739	62739	she	204	" Come and sit in the armchair , Rose , "
62821	62828	62829	62829	she	204	" You make your own clothes ? "
62848	62851	62853	62853	Maggie	316	" Yes , "
62862	62867	62869	62869	Rose	204	" For a party ? "
62884	62888	62890	62890	Maggie	316	" Tomorrow night , "
62969	62978	62979	62979	she	204	" I never could make my own clothes , "
63037	63041	63043	63043	Maggie	316	" But then , "
63053	63059	63060	63060	She	316	" you did other things . "
63089	63097	63099	63099	Rose	204	" Yes , I did other things , "
63112	63119	63099	63099	Rose	204	" when I lived down here . "
63120	63127	63128	63128	she	316	" But that was years ago , "
63131	63144	63145	63145	she	316	" when I was young . I lived here with a friend , "
63148	63154	63145	63145	she	316	" and taught little thieves . "
63168	63178	63179	63179	Rose	204	" I always liked thieves better than other people , "
63185	63188	63190	63190	Maggie	316	" Yes , "
63192	63200	63202	63202	Rose	204	" I never liked being at home , "
63204	63214	63202	63202	Rose	204	" I liked being on my own much better . "
63215	63218	63220	63220	Maggie	316	" Yes , "
63277	63291	63292	63292	she	344	" What was that about clinging to a fat man in the Campagna ? "
63300	63304	63306	63306	Rose	204	" The Campagna ? "
63308	63316	63306	63306	Rose	204	" There was nothing about the Campagna . "
63317	63323	63325	63325	Sara	344	" Heard through a door , "
63332	63338	63339	63339	She	344	" talk sounds very odd . "
63345	63362	63384	63384	she	204	" I thought you were talking about Italy ; about the Campagna , about the moonlight . "
63368	63377	63378	63378	she	204	" We were talking about the Waterloo Road , "
63416	63432	63433	63433	she	204	" All talk would be nonsense , I suppose , if it were written down , "
63450	63458	63459	63459	she	316	" And even if it is n't , "
63462	63476	63477	63477	Rose	204	" But it 's the only way we have of knowing each other , "
63497	63502	63503	63503	she	204	" I must go , "
63506	63516	63517	63517	she	204	" But why do n't you come with me ? "
63532	63535	63536	63536	she	316	" Where ? "
63543	63548	63549	63549	she	204	" To a meeting , "
63597	63603	63604	63604	she	204	" You could wait upstairs , "
63608	63626	63627	63627	she	204	" And you 'd see Eleanor ; you 'd see Martin - the Pargiters in the flesh , "
63636	63643	63644	63644	she	204	" the caravan crossing the desert , "
63674	63679	63680	63680	she	344	" Shall I come ? "
63698	63703	63704	63704	she	204	" If you like , "
63707	63714	63715	63715	Sara	344	" But should I like it ? "
63723	63737	63738	63738	she	204	" . . . this meeting ? What do you think , Maggie ? "
63746	63765	63738	63738	she	204	" Shall I go , or sha n't I ? Shall I go , or sha n't I ? "
63789	63800	63801	63801	she	344	" Go search the valleys ; pluck up every rose , "
63812	63821	63809	63809	he	826	" Any old iron ? Any old iron ? "
63830	63835	63836	63836	she	344	" I 'll come , "
63848	63858	63836	63836	she	344	" I 'll fling on my clothes and come . "
63930	63937	63938	63939	the man	826	" Any old iron to sell ? "
63946	63951	63938	63939	the man	826	" any old iron ? "
63980	63985	63986	63986	she	204	" Poor little wretches ! "
64004	64013	64014	64014	she	204	" Do n't you find it rather unpleasant , "
64035	64050	64014	64014	she	204	" coming home late at night sometimes with that public house at the corner ? "
64051	64058	64060	64060	Maggie	316	" Drunken men , you mean ? "
64062	64065	64067	64067	Rose	204	" Yes , "
64099	64108	64110	64110	Sara	344	" And now what are you talking about ? "
64118	64124	64110	64110	Sara	344	" Another visit to Italy ? "
64125	64128	64130	64130	Maggie	316	" No , "
64143	64149	64132	64132	She	316	" Drunken men following one . "
64150	64156	64158	64158	Sara	344	" Drunken men following one , "
64171	64179	64180	64180	she	344	" But they do n't follow me , "
64198	64214	64215	64215	she	204	" I can walk over Waterloo Bridge at any hour of the day or night , "
64223	64228	64215	64215	she	204	" and nobody notices . "
64243	64249	64250	64250	she	204	" But I can remember , "
64253	64269	64250	64250	she	204	" being told by a woman - a very beautiful woman - she was like - "
64270	64274	64275	64275	Maggie	316	" Hurry up , "
64278	64283	64275	64275	Maggie	316	" Rose is waiting . "
64284	64310	64312	64312	she	204	" . . . Rose is waiting - well , the woman told me , when she went into Regent 's Park to have an ice "
64326	64356	64358	64358	she	204	" - to have an ice , at one of those little tables under the trees , one of those little round tables laid with a cloth under the trees "
64370	64402	64403	64403	she	204	" the eyes , she said , came through every leaf like the darts of the sun ; and her ice was melted . . . . Her ice was melted ! "
64426	64437	64438	64438	she	204	" You 're going to stay and finish your dress ? "
64441	64449	64438	64438	she	204	" You wo n't come with us ? "
64458	64466	64468	64468	Maggie	316	" No , I wo n't come , "
64473	64479	64480	64480	she	316	" I should hate it , "
64603	64610	64611	64611	he	2460	" Nice vilets , fresh vilets , "

64819	64828	64830	64830	Sara	344	" Is this the place where you meet ? "
64902	64910	64912	64912	Rose	204	" That 's the house over there , "
64983	64989	64990	64990	she	204	" Are you coming in , "
64993	64999	64990	64990	she	204	" or are n't you ? "
65022	65026	65027	65027	she	344	" All right ! "

65774	65777	65778	65778	she	313	" Yes , "
65889	65902	65903	65903	Kitty	254	" . . . and we discussed the whole matter perfectly frankly , "
66243	66252	66253	66253	she	195	" About coming to see you on Wednesday , "

69511	69515	69516	69516	she	316	" and suddenly , "
69522	69531	69516	69516	she	316	" I felt a clap on my shoulder . "
69532	69536	69538	69538	Rose	204	" Damned liar ! "

69597	69615	69616	69616	she	344	" and there were people - multitudes of people . And I said to myself . . . "
69619	69623	69624	69624	Maggie	316	" A meeting ? "
69627	69630	69624	69624	Maggie	316	" Where ? "
69631	69636	69637	69637	Sara	344	" In a room , "
69640	69669	69637	69637	Sara	344	" A pale greenish light . A woman hanging clothes on a line in the back garden ; and someone went by rattling a stick on the railings . "
69670	69674	69676	69676	Maggie	316	" I see , "
69683	69689	69690	69690	Sara	344	" I said to myself , "
69693	69701	69702	69702	she	344	" whose heads are those . . . "
69705	69709	69710	69710	Maggie	316	" A meeting , "
69714	69721	69710	69710	Maggie	316	" What for ? What about ? "
69722	69728	69729	69729	Sara	344	" There were pigeons cooing , "
69733	69772	69729	69729	Sara	344	" Take two coos , Taffy . Take two coos . . . Tak . . . And then a wing darkened the air , and in came Kitty clothed in starlight ; and sat on a chair . "
69788	69793	69794	69794	she	316	" Who came in ? "
69799	69814	69816	69816	Sara	344	" Somebody very beautiful ; clothed in starlight ; with green in her hair , "
69818	69820	69816	69816	Sara	344	" Whereupon "
69848	69870	69823	69823	she	344	" up jumps Mr Pickford , and says ' Oh , Lady Lasswade , wo n't you take this chair ? ' "
69880	69884	69885	69885	she	344	" And then , "
69893	69906	69908	69908	she	344	" Lady Lasswade sits down ; puts her gloves on the table , "
69913	69917	69908	69908	she	344	" like that . "
69961	69966	69967	69967	she	316	" What happened then ? "
69970	69984	69985	69985	Sara	344	" Then withered Rose , spiky Rose , tawny Rose , thorny Rose , "
69995	69995	69985	69985	Sara	344	"
69996	70001	70003	70003	Maggie	316	" No , no , "
70102	70106	70107	70107	Maggie	316	" Another row ? "
70240	70246	70247	70247	she	344	" In time to come , "
70255	70284	70286	70286	she	344	" people , looking into this room - this cave , this little antre , scooped out of mud and dung , will hold their fingers to their noses "
70294	70304	70286	70286	she	344	" and say ' Pah ! They stink ! ' "
70350	70353	70354	70354	Maggie	316	" Pah ! "
70359	70362	70354	70354	Maggie	316	" They stink "
70445	70454	70455	70455	she	316	" That 's done . That 's finished , "
70510	70519	70521	70521	Maggie	316	" You want your supper , do you ? "
70537	70543	70544	70544	she	316	" There , poor puss , "
70595	70606	70607	70607	she	344	" There , poor puss , there , poor puss , "
70610	70619	70620	70620	she	344	" As you rock the cradle , Maggie , "
70706	70719	70721	70721	Maggie	316	" Upcher 's come home drunk and wants to be let in , "
70741	70761	70762	70762	she	344	" Bring up your children on a desert island where the ships only come when the moon 's full ! "
70765	70770	70772	70772	Maggie	316	" Or have none ? "
70812	70824	70826	70826	Maggie	316	" Now he 'll stagger against the wall and be sick , "
70950	70956	70957	70957	she	316	" What 's he crying ? "
70967	70973	70974	70974	she	316	" Death . . . ? "
70977	70983	70985	70985	Sara	344	" Death . . . ? "
71018	71024	71003	71012	a man who was wheeling a barrow along the street	2640	" The King 's dead ! "
71616	71623	71625	71625	Eleanor	276	" Sorry to be so late , "
72007	72016	72017	72017	she	276	" Midges very bad this year , William ? "
72024	72032	72033	72033	he	2693	" Tarrible bad , miss , tarrible , "
72682	72686	72687	72692	her sister - in - law	1790	" Oh Eleanor ! "
72707	72724	72687	72692	her sister - in - law	1790	" How nice to see you ! How brown you look ! Come into the cool ! "
72756	72764	72766	72766	Celia	334	" We 're in such a mess , "
72773	72788	72766	72766	Celia	334	" Lady St. Austell has only just this minute gone , and the Bishop . "
72798	72818	72825	72825	she	334	" But it 's been a great success . We had the bazaar in the garden . They acted . "
72830	72834	72836	72836	Eleanor	276	" A play ? "
72838	72846	72848	72848	Celia	334	" Yes , a scene from Shakespeare , "
72850	72888	72848	72848	Celia	334	" Midsummer - Night ? As You Like It ? I forget which . Miss Green got it up . Happily it was so fine . Last year it poured . But how my feet are aching ! "
72904	72909	72910	72910	she	276	" What an undertaking ! "
72913	72917	72918	72918	Celia	334	" It was ! "
72921	72953	72918	72918	Celia	334	" We had Lady St. Austell and the Bishop , coco - nut shies and a pig ; but I think it all went off very well . They enjoyed it . "
72954	72959	72960	72960	Eleanor	276	" For the Church ? "
72963	72970	72972	72972	Celia	334	" Yes . The new steeple , "
72974	72979	72981	72981	Eleanor	276	" What a business ! "
73020	73027	73028	73028	Celia	334	" Was it nice in Spain ? "
73032	73039	73028	73028	Celia	334	" Did you see wonderful things ? "
73040	73044	73045	73045	Eleanor	276	" Oh yes ! "
73048	73054	73055	73055	She	276	" I saw . . . "
73082	73092	73094	73094	Celia	334	" You must tell me all about it afterwards , "
73098	73111	73112	73112	she	334	" It 's time we got ready . But I 'm afraid , "
73123	73146	73147	73147	she	334	" I must ask you to be careful , because we 're very short of water . The well . . . . "
73229	73241	73242	73242	she	334	" We 're putting you in the Blue room this time , "
73256	73264	73265	73265	she	334	" I hope you 've got everything - "
73268	73279	73281	73281	Eleanor	276	" Yes , I 'm sure I 've got everything , "
73706	73716	73718	73718	Morris	237	" You know each other , do n't you ? "
73720	73727	73728	73728	He	237	" Eleanor - Sir William Whatney . "
73736	73738	73728	73728	He	237	" Sir "
73746	73754	73756	73757	Sir William	377	" We used to know each other , "
73998	74008	74010	74010	Eleanor	276	" That 's what I saw on the perambulator , "
74012	74021	74022	74022	she	276	" I met the F te coming back , "
74038	74050	74052	74052	Celia	334	" Do n't you envy my sister - in - law ? "
74059	74070	74052	74052	Celia	334	" She 's just back from a tour in Greece . "
74071	74074	74076	74077	Sir William	377	" Indeed ! "
74079	74085	74076	74077	Sir William	377	" Which part of Greece ? "
74086	74100	74101	74101	Eleanor	276	" We went to Athens , then to Olympia , then to Delphi , "
74121	74131	74132	74132	Celia	334	" My brother - in - law , Edward , "
74135	74141	74132	74132	Celia	334	" takes these delightful tours . "
74142	74147	74149	74149	Morris	237	" You remember Edward ? "
74151	74159	74149	74149	Morris	237	" Were n't you up with him ? "
74160	74169	74171	74172	Sir William	377	" No , he was junior to me , "
74174	74204	74171	74172	Sir William	377	" But I 've heard of him , of course . He 's - let me think - what is he - a great swell , is n't he ? "
74205	74217	74219	74219	Morris	237	" Oh , he 's at the top of his tree , "
74253	74258	74259	74259	she	276	" They loved him , "
74310	74319	74323	74323	her	276	" Did you meet anyone at the Embassy ? "
74330	74339	74326	74326	he	377	" Not an Embassy though , is it ? "
74340	74349	74351	74351	Morris	237	" No . Athens is not an Embassy , "
74381	74394	74395	74396	Sir William	377	" There 's going to be trouble there in the near future , "
74478	74489	74490	74490	he	237	" Your sister has the brightest eyes I ever saw , "
74592	74600	74601	74601	Celia	334	" Give Sir William some more wine , "
74653	74712	74713	74713	He	237	" . . . and I found myself in an old pair of riding - breeches standing under a peacock umbrella ; and all the good people were crouching with their heads to the ground . ' Good Lord , ' I said to myself , ' if they only knew what a bally ass I feel ! ' "
74722	74735	74736	74736	he	237	" That 's how we were taught our job in those days , "
74759	74766	74768	74768	they	2798	" about the size of Ireland , "
75038	75043	75044	75044	Peggy	316	" There he goes , "
75051	75057	75058	75058	she	316	" The owl . . . "
75108	75114	75116	75116	Peggy	316	" You can time him , "
75118	75124	75116	75116	Peggy	316	" he 's so regular . "
75131	75141	75142	75142	she	334	" Shall we leave the gentlemen to their politics , "
75145	75154	75142	75142	she	334	" and have our coffee on the terrace ? "
75167	75174	75176	75176	Eleanor	276	" I 'll fetch my glasses , "
75387	75399	75400	75400	Peggy	316	" Did father say Sir William was in love with her ? "
75409	75418	75420	75420	Celia	334	" Oh I do n't know about that , "
75422	75448	75449	75449	she	334	" But I wish they could have married . I wish she had children of her own . And then they could have settled here , "
75452	75460	75449	75449	she	334	" He 's such a delightful man . "
75473	75493	75470	75470	Celia	334	" I hope you were polite to the Robinsons this afternoon , dreadful as they are . . . . "
75494	75501	75503	75503	Peggy	316	" They give ripping parties anyhow , "
75505	75512	75513	75514	her mother	685	" ' Ripping , ripping , ' "
75519	75544	75545	75545	she	334	" I wish you would n't pick up all North 's slang , my dear . . . . Oh , here 's Eleanor , "
75584	75593	75595	75595	Peggy	316	" He 'll be back in a minute , "
75602	75610	75595	75595	Peggy	316	" He 'll come along that hedge . "
75632	75635	75637	75637	Celia	334	" Now , "
75644	75656	75637	75637	Celia	334	" There are so many things I want to ask you . "
75691	75697	75698	75698	she	334	" In the first place , "
75701	75707	75698	75698	she	334	" No . . . . "
75717	75725	75726	75726	she	334	" What 's all this about Rose ? "
75729	75732	75734	75734	Eleanor	276	" What ? "
75744	75751	75752	75752	she	334	" It 's getting too dark , "
75760	75774	75776	75776	Celia	334	" Morris says she 's been had up in a police - court , "
75788	75794	75796	75796	Eleanor	276	" She threw a brick - "
75821	75829	75830	75830	Peggy	316	" Will she be put in prison ? "
75834	75839	75841	75841	Eleanor	276	" Not this time , "
75843	75853	75854	75854	she	276	" Next time - Ah , here he comes ! "
75898	75908	75909	75909	she	276	" He 's got a mouse in his claws ! "
75912	75922	75924	75924	Peggy	316	" He 's got a nest in the steeple , "
75936	75946	75948	75948	Eleanor	276	" Now I ca n't see him any more , "
75978	75985	75986	75986	she	334	" Tell me about William Whatney , "
75989	76005	75986	75986	she	334	" When I last saw him he was a slim young man in a boat . "
76011	76019	76020	76020	she	316	" That must have been ages ago ! "
76023	76029	76031	76031	Eleanor	276	" Not so very long , "
76038	76041	76042	76042	she	276	" Well - "
76045	76055	76042	76042	she	276	" twenty years - twenty - five years perhaps . "
76086	76094	76095	76095	Celia	334	" Is n't he a delightful man ? "
76098	76133	76095	76095	Celia	334	" He was in India , you know . Now he 's retired , and we do hope he 'll take a house here ; but Morris thinks he 'd find it too dull . "
76178	76189	76191	76191	Peggy	316	" It 's going to be another hot day tomorrow , "
76314	76320	76321	76321	she	316	" How lovely it is ! "
76335	76344	76346	76346	Celia	334	" If only Mr Robinson does n't build ! "
76365	76380	76381	76381	Celia	334	" I did my best to be polite to them at the bazaar today , "
76384	76408	76381	76381	Celia	334	" Some people wo n't ask them ; but I say one must be polite to neighbours in the country . . . . "
76413	76425	76426	76426	she	334	" There are so many things I want to ask you , "
76442	76453	76454	76454	Celia	334	" Have you had an offer for Abercorn Terrace yet ? "
76468	76472	76474	76474	Eleanor	276	" Not yet , "
76476	76488	76474	76474	Eleanor	276	" The agent wants me to cut it up into flats . "
76498	76513	76493	76493	she	334	" And now about Maggie - when 's her baby going to be born ? "
76514	76521	76523	76523	Eleanor	276	" In November , I think , "
76525	76529	76530	76530	she	276	" In Paris , "
76533	76542	76544	76544	Celia	334	" I hope it 'll be all right , "
76546	76559	76560	76560	She	276	" But I do wish it could have been born in England . "
76564	76574	76575	76575	she	276	" Her children will be French , I suppose ? "
76578	76586	76588	76588	Eleanor	276	" Yes ; French , I suppose , "
76612	76622	76624	76624	Celia	334	" Everybody says he 's a very nice fellow , "
76626	76632	76624	76624	Celia	334	" But René - René , "
76638	76650	76624	76624	Celia	334	" - it does n't sound like a man 's name . "
76651	76658	76660	76660	Peggy	316	" You can call him Renny , "
76669	76693	76624	76624	Celia	334	" But that reminds me of Ronny ; and I do n't like Ronny . We had a stable - boy called Ronny . "
76694	76700	76702	76702	Peggy	316	" Who stole the hay , "
76709	76716	76717	76717	Celia	334	" It 's such a pity - "
76734	76745	76747	76747	Celia	334	" It 's a wonderful night , is n't it ? "
76758	76780	76747	76747	Celia	334	" It looks as if it would never rain again . In which case I do n't know . . . . "
76812	76825	76828	76828	Celia	334	" Oh , but there 's quite enough for everybody at present , "
76849	76858	76859	76859	she	276	" - quite enough for everybody at present , "
76930	76936	76937	76937	Celia	334	" What was I saying ? "
76940	76956	76937	76937	Celia	334	" I was saying , It 's such a pity . Yes . . . . "
76977	76984	76985	76985	she	334	" Oh , here they are ! "
77084	77089	77091	77091	North	383	" There he goes , "
77155	77166	77168	77168	Morris	237	" It 's going to be a fine day tomorrow , "
77255	77260	77261	77261	Celia	334	" I hate bats ! "
77272	77276	77278	77279	Sir William	377	" Do you ? "
77281	77287	77288	77288	His	377	" I rather like them . "
77311	77319	77320	77320	Celia	334	" They get into one 's hair , "
77323	77331	77333	77334	Sir William	377	" But I have n't any hair , "
77565	77573	77574	77574	she	276	" Why do n't they come in ? "
77607	77612	77613	77613	she	334	" That 's Mama , "
77616	77622	77613	77613	she	334	" We must go in . "
77843	77847	77848	77848	she	376	" Not tonight , "
77863	77873	77874	77874	She	376	" I am sure it will bore Sir William ? "
77896	77905	77906	77906	he	2878	" Not at all . Not at all , "
77911	77918	77919	77919	he	2878	" Nothing would please me more , "
78068	78072	78073	78073	she	334	" The bazaar , "
78081	78096	78073	78073	she	334	" I shall go to bed . Come , Peggy . Come , Eleanor . "
78143	78149	78150	78150	Celia	334	" Come along , Peggy , "
78186	78191	78170	78170	she	334	" Come , Peggy . "
79614	79627	79628	79628	he	393	" The fact is , our clients expect more lavatory accommodation nowadays , "
79642	79644	79640	79640	he	393	" baths "
79869	79884	79886	79886	Eleanor	276	" Well , Crosby , it all looks very empty , does n't it ? "
79929	79936	79938	79938	Crosby	202	" It does , Miss Eleanor , "
79970	79985	79987	79987	Crosby	202	" I can still see you all sitting round that table , Miss Eleanor , "
80013	80022	80024	80024	Eleanor	276	" And the kettle that would n't boil , "
80026	80031	80024	80024	Eleanor	276	" D'you remember that ? "
80037	80043	80045	80045	Crosby	202	" Oh , Miss Eleanor , "
80051	80056	80045	80045	Crosby	202	" I remember everything ! "
80246	80264	80266	80266	Eleanor	276	" I should think you 'd be glad to be out of that basement anyhow , Crosby , "
80292	80297	80298	80298	she	276	" our Mr Grice , "
80303	80314	80316	80316	Crosby	202	" It was my home for forty years , Miss , "
80378	80386	80388	80388	Eleanor	276	" You 're sure you want him ? "
80402	80416	80388	80388	Eleanor	276	" We could easily find a nice home for him in the country . "
80417	80431	80433	80433	Crosby	202	" Oh , miss , do n't ask me to give him up ! "
80464	80472	80473	80473	she	276	" Dear Crosby , good - bye , "
81113	81122	81124	81125	Mrs Burt	396	" Come along with me , my dear , "
81135	81142	81124	81125	Mrs Burt	396	" and let Bishop do it . "
81143	81154	81156	81157	Mr Bishop	394	" He wo n't suffer , I can assure you , "
81179	81186	81164	81164	He	394	" He 'll just take one sniff "
81199	81209	81164	81164	He	394	" and he 'll be off in a jiffy . "
81210	81220	81221	81222	Mrs Burt	396	" It 'll be for his good , Annie , "
81361	81374	81376	81377	Mrs Burt	396	" It 's a mercy she 's got something to distract her , "
81412	81424	81425	81425	she	202	" But he ought to have been put down long ago , "
81814	81826	81806	81806	He	205	" Well , Crosby , how 's the world treating you ? "
81877	81885	81886	81886	he	205	" What d'you call THAT , Crosby ? "
81909	81915	81916	81916	she	202	" A burn , sir , "
81921	81931	81933	81933	Martin	205	" Brand new pyjamas ; only worn them twice , "
81955	81962	81963	81963	she	202	" Tut - tut - tut ! "
81970	81985	81986	81986	he	205	" Will you please take this pyjama to Mrs What's - her - name , "
82028	82036	82037	82037	he	205	" Tell her to get another laundress , "
82040	82050	82037	82037	he	205	" and send the old one to the devil . "
82101	82107	82108	82108	he	205	" How 's the rheumatics ? "
82182	82190	82191	82191	he	205	" Seen Miss Eleanor 's new flat ? "
82213	82224	82225	82225	she	202	" And the people 's not worth it , sir , "

115613	115625	115634	115634	her	344	" How nice to see you - you 've filled out , "
115704	115716	115717	115717	he	383	" The odds on that side ; the evens on this , "
115796	115801	115802	115802	he	383	" What a dirty , "
115832	115836	115817	115818	a woman	5302	" he added , "
115845	116124	115817	115818	a woman	5302	" He cut off his engine ; got out , and examined the names on the door . Names mounted one above another ; here on a visiting - card , here engraved on brass - Foster ; Abrahamson ; Roberts ; S. Pargiter was near the top , punched on a strip of aluminium . He rang one of the many bells . No one came . The woman went on singing scales , mounting slowly . The mood comes , the mood goes , he thought . He used to write poetry ; now the mood had come again as he stood there waiting . He pressed the bell two or three times sharply . But no one answered . Then he gave the door a push ; it was open . There was a curious smell in the hall ; of vegetables cooking ; and the oily brown paper made it dark . He went up the stairs of what had once been a gentleman 's residence . The banisters were carved ; but they had been daubed over with some cheap yellow varnish . He mounted slowly and stood on the landing , uncertain which door to knock at . He was always finding himself now outside the doors of strange houses . He had a feeling that he was no one and nowhere in particular . From across the road came the voice of the singer deliberately ascending the scale , as if the notes were stairs ; and here she stopped indolently , languidly , flinging out the voice that was nothing but pure sound . Then he heard somebody inside , laughing .
116174	116181	116182	116182	Sara	344	" Yes , yes , yes , "
116237	116240	116241	116241	she	344	" What ? "

116759	116763	116764	116764	he	383	" What picture ? "
116767	116781	116782	116782	she	344	" The one who sits looking puzzled with his hat in his hand , "
116803	116806	116807	116807	he	383	" Sorry , "
116837	116849	116850	116850	he	383	" This is n't the room where I came last time ? "

117576	117580	117581	117581	she	344	" And then , "
117598	117621	117581	117581	she	344	" - how can we make laws , religions , that fit , that fit , when we do n't know ourselves ? "

117745	117752	117742	117742	he	383	" we discussed . . . . "
117781	117791	117792	117792	he	383	" - society or solitude ; which is best , "
117804	117808	117809	117809	she	344	" And which , "
117838	117854	117855	117855	she	344	" - which did you say ? You who 've been alone all these years , "
117865	117873	117874	117874	She	1220	" - among your sheep , North . "

118019	118025	118026	118026	she	1220	" And then . . . "
118049	118057	118058	118058	she	1220	" - then you saddled a horse , "
118061	118066	118058	118058	she	1220	" and rode away ! "
118096	118100	118101	118101	he	4119	" D'you know , "

118934	118944	118945	118945	she	1220	" And there was nothing to break the silence , "
118954	118972	118973	118973	She	1220	" but a tree falling , or a rock breaking from the side of a distant mountain - "
118991	118994	118995	118995	he	383	" Yes , "
118998	119004	118995	118995	he	383	" It was very silent . "
119005	119009	119010	119010	she	1220	" And hot , "
119013	119030	119010	119010	she	1220	" Blazing hot at midday : an old tramp tapped on your door . . . ? "
119047	119051	119052	119052	she	1220	" And then - "
119103	119108	119109	119109	she	1220	" And the birds , "
119113	119122	119109	119109	she	1220	" The nightingales , singing in the moonlight ? "
119133	119144	119145	119145	he	383	" I must have written you a lot of nonsense ! "
119148	119160	119129	119129	she	1220	" I wish you 'd torn them up - those letters ! "
119161	119172	119173	119173	she	1220	" No ! They were beautiful letters ! Wonderful letters ! "
119200	119209	119210	119210	she	1220	" And then you had a day off , "
119214	119231	119210	119210	she	1220	" and jolted along a rough white road in a springless cart to the next town - "
119232	119237	119238	119238	he	383	" Sixty miles away , "
119241	119258	119259	119259	She	1220	" And went to a bar ; and met a man from the next - ranch ? "
119271	119278	119279	119279	he	383	" Ranch , yes , ranch , "
119283	119297	119279	119279	he	383	" I went to the town and had a drink at the bar - "
119298	119302	119303	119303	she	1220	" And then ? "
119323	119329	119330	119330	she	1220	" Then you stopped writing , "
119339	119348	119349	119349	he	383	" When I forgot what you were like , "
119356	119363	119364	119364	he	383	" You gave up writing too , "
119367	119373	119374	119374	she	1220	" Yes , I too , "
119424	119442	119444	119444	she	1220	" Our hearts full of tears , our lips full of laughter , we passed on the stairs "
119457	119471	119444	119444	she	1220	" we passed on the stair - r - r - r - s "
119484	119493	119494	119494	she	1220	" He to sorrow , I to bliss , "

119614	119628	119629	119629	She	1220	" The bells do n't ring , and the taps do n't run . "
119647	119657	119658	119658	he	383	" But there was one letter you wrote me , "
119664	119673	119658	119658	he	383	" An angry letter ; a cruel letter . "
119700	119703	119704	119704	she	1220	" Yes ? "
119707	119717	119718	119718	he	383	" The night you came in from the Strand , "
119749	119753	119755	119755	Sara	344	" I remember , "
119765	119787	119755	119755	Sara	344	" a still autumn night ; the lights lit ; and people padding along the pavement with wreaths in their hands ? "
119788	119791	119792	119792	he	383	" Yes , "
119795	119800	119792	119792	he	383	" That was it . "
119801	119808	119809	119809	she	344	" And I said to myself , "
119812	119822	119823	119823	He	383	" this is Hell . We are the damned ? "
119832	119836	119837	119837	he	383	" And I , "
119846	119852	119853	119853	He	383	" was among the damned . "
119867	119886	119887	119887	He	383	" Coward ; hypocrite , with your switch in your hand ; and your cap on your head - "
119908	119920	119921	119921	she	344	" But what was the word - the word I used ? "
119932	119935	119936	119936	he	383	" Poppycock ! "
119943	119952	119953	119953	she	344	" And then I went over the bridge , "
119966	119994	119953	119953	she	344	" and stopped in one of those little alcoves , bays , what d'you call 'em ? - scooped out over the water , and looked down - "
120002	120014	120015	120015	he	383	" When you lived on the other side of the river , "
120019	120025	120026	120026	she	344	" Stood and looked down , "
120041	120062	120026	120026	she	344	" and thought ; Running water , flowing water , water that crinkles up the lights ; moonlight ; starlight - "
120069	120075	120076	120076	he	383	" Then the car came , "
120080	120098	120076	120076	he	383	" Yes ; the Rolls - Royce . It stopped in the lamplight and there they sat - "
120099	120103	120104	120104	he	383	" Two people , "

120172	120181	120167	120167	she	344	" and polish that spade , her mouth . "
120187	120192	120193	120193	he	383	" And the peroration ? "

120977	120997	120998	120998	He	383	" I 'm dining with Sara . . . . Yes , I 'll tell her . . . . "
121004	121015	121016	121016	he	383	" She is sitting on the edge of her chair , "
121019	121034	121016	121016	he	383	" with a smudge on her face , swinging her foot up and down . "

121195	121200	121201	121201	she	276	" We were saying - "
121204	121211	121213	121213	Peggy	316	" You 've had it cleaned , "
121236	121239	121240	121240	Eleanor	276	" Yes , "
121247	121263	121264	121264	she	276	" Yes . And do you see there 's a flower fallen on the grass ? "
121320	121328	121330	121330	Eleanor	276	" It was hidden by the dirt , "
121332	121360	121330	121330	Eleanor	276	" But I can just remember it , when I was a child . That reminds me , if you want a good man to clean pictures - "
121361	121368	121369	121369	Peggy	316	" But was it like her ? "
121418	121426	121427	121427	Eleanor	276	" I 've got the address somewhere , "
121431	121440	121442	121442	Peggy	316	" Do n't bother - do n't bother , "
121480	121486	121487	121487	she	316	" Was it like her ? "
121491	121498	121500	121500	Eleanor	276	" Not as I remember her , "
121509	121533	121534	121534	she	316	" When I was a child perhaps - no , I do n't think even as a child . What 's so interesting , "
121537	121561	121562	121562	she	316	" is that what they thought ugly - red hair for instance - we think pretty ; so that I often ask myself , "
121570	121577	121562	121562	she	316	" ' What is pretty ? ' "
121578	121581	121583	121583	Peggy	316	" Yes , "

121682	121686	121691	121691	She	276	" I wonder , "
121698	121702	121703	121703	she	316	" How annoying ! "
121707	121764	121703	121703	she	316	" I had it on the tip of my tongue - something I want to ask you . Then I thought of Delia 's party : then North made me laugh - Sally sitting on the edge of her chair with a smudge on her nose ; and that 's put it out of my head . "
121770	121797	121798	121798	she	316	" D'you know the feeling when one 's been on the point of saying something , and been interrupted ; how it seems to stick HERE , "
121819	121832	121798	121798	she	316	" she added . She wandered about the room for a moment . "
121845	121852	121840	121840	I	0	" she said , shaking her head .
121853	121869	121798	121798	she	316	" I shall go and get ready now , if you 'll call a cab . "
121938	121944	121917	121917	She	316	" Mon Repos , Wimbledon . "

122076	122081	122083	122083	she	316	" Number , please , "
122246	122249	122263	122263	she	316	" Hullo , "
122295	122316	122317	122317	Peggy	316	" One of these days d'you think you 'll be able to see things at the end of the telephone ? "
122376	122381	122383	122383	Eleanor	276	" What 's that ? "
122575	122590	122591	122591	she	276	" That 's where I saw my first aeroplane - there between those chimneys , "
122624	122633	122634	122634	Eleanor	276	" I was standing here , looking out , "
122638	122708	122634	122634	Eleanor	276	" It must have been just after I 'd got into the flat , a summer 's day , and I saw a black spot in the sky , and I said to whoever it was - Miriam Parrish , I think , yes , for she came to help me to get into the flat - I hope Delia , by the way , remembered to ask her - "
122727	122733	122734	122734	she	316	" You said to Miriam - "
122738	122843	122734	122734	she	316	" I said to Miriam , ' Is it a bird ? No , I do n't think it can be a bird . It 's too big . Yet it moves . ' And suddenly it came over me , that 's an aeroplane ! And it was ! You know they 'd flown the Channel not so very long before . I was staying with you in Dorset at the time : and I remember reading it out in the paper , and someone - your father , I think - said : ' The world will never be the same again ! "
122844	122849	122850	122850	Peggy	316	" Oh , well - "
122905	122909	122910	122910	she	276	" Oh dear , "
122985	122991	122992	122992	Peggy	316	" What , Nell - ? "
122995	123000	123002	123002	Eleanor	276	" Nothing , nothing , "

123214	123307	123308	123308	She	276	" Yes - I do n't know about aeroplanes , I 've never been up in one ; but motor cars - I could do without motor cars . I was almost knocked down by one , did I tell you ? In the Brompton Road . All my own fault - I was n't looking . . . . And wireless - that 's a nuisance - the people downstairs turn it on after breakfast ; but on the other hand - hot water ; electric light ; and those new - "
123311	123318	123319	123319	she	276	" Ah , there it is ! "
123334	123357	123322	123322	She	276	" If Edward 's there tonight , do remind me - I 'll tie a knot in my handkerchief . . . . "

123778	123803	123804	123804	Eleanor	276	" take my aunt , living alone in a sort of workman 's flat at the top of six flights of stairs . . . "
123807	123813	123814	123814	she	316	" Do n't tell me , "
123817	123839	123814	123814	she	316	" that I left the letter upstairs - Runcorn 's letter that I want to show Edward , about the boy ? "

123952	123956	123957	123957	Eleanor	276	" You see , "
123969	123980	123962	123962	she	276	" it means the end of everything we cared for . "
123981	123984	123986	123986	Peggy	316	" Freedom ? "
123989	123992	123994	123994	Eleanor	276	" Yes , "
123996	124001	123994	123994	Eleanor	276	" Freedom and justice . "
124063	124070	124071	124071	she	316	" Suddenly she lost her temper , "
124074	124091	124071	124071	she	316	" took the paper and tore it across - my aunt , who 's over seventy . "
124106	124115	124116	124116	she	316	" That 's where we used to live , "

124390	124458	124459	124459	she	4244	" Your father and I. The man he used to read with . What was his name ? He became a Judge . . . . We used to dine there , the three of us . Morris , my father and I. . . . They had very large parties in those days . Always legal people . And he collected old oak . Mostly shams , "
124466	124474	124475	124475	Peggy	316	" You used to dine . . . "
124516	124525	124526	124526	she	4244	" Tell me about your youth . . . "

125276	125307	125308	125308	she	276	" Travel 's so easy . You just take a ticket ; just get on board ship . . . . But what I want to see before I die , "

126320	126354	126355	126355	She	276	" you ought to travel : the natives are so beautiful you know ; half naked : going down to the river in the moonlight ; - that 's the house over there - "
126366	126407	126355	126355	She	276	" What was I saying ? I 'm not despondent , no , because people are so kind , so good at heart . . . . So that if only ordinary people , ordinary people like ourselves . . . "

159441	159446	159448	159448	Peggy	316	" Yes , North , "
159459	159471	159472	159472	she	316	" North says we talk of nothing but money and politics , "
159475	159484	159485	159485	He	383	" Tell us what we ought to do . "
159645	159656	159657	159657	Kitty	254	" . . . It 's a nice little house , "
159661	159693	159657	159657	Kitty	254	" An old mad woman used to live there . . . . You 'll have to come and stay with me , Nell . In the spring . . . . "

159831	159844	159827	159827	Edward	215	" I thought you never liked anyone at Oxford . . . . "
159913	159925	159926	159926	he	383	" . . . To live differently . . . differently , "
159988	159995	159996	159997	Lady Lasswade	313	" Yes , it was Robson ! "
160009	160015	160016	160016	she	313	" How one forgets things ! "
160020	160051	160016	160016	she	313	" Of course - Robson . That was his name . And the girl I used to like - Nelly ? The girl who was going to be a doctor ? "
160052	160058	160060	160060	Edward	215	" Died , I think , "
160062	160070	160072	160073	Lady Lasswade	313	" Died , did she - died - "
160081	160092	160093	160093	she	313	" Well , I wish you 'd make your speech , "

160785	160795	160750	160750	Kitty	254	" . . . the one that was interrupted ? "
160796	160800	160801	160801	he	431	" My speech ? "
160804	160813	160814	160814	he	431	" It was to have been a miracle ! "
160817	160890	160891	160891	He	431	" A masterpiece ! But how can one speak when one is always interrupted ? I begin : I say , Let us give thanks . Then Delia says , Do n't thank me . I begin again : I say , Let us give thanks to someone , to somebody . . . And Renny says , What for ? I begin again , and look - Eleanor is sound asleep . "
160896	160903	160891	160891	He	431	" So what 's the good ? "

160997	161020	161021	161021	he	431	" First I was going to have thanked our host and hostess . Then I was going to have thanked this house - "
161037	161058	161059	161059	he	431	" - which has sheltered the lovers , the creators , the men and women of goodwill . And finally - "
161067	161082	161083	161083	he	431	" I was going to drink to the human race . The human race , "
161093	161111	161112	161112	he	431	" which is now in its infancy , may it grow to maturity ! Ladies and gentlemen ! "
161122	161128	161112	161112	he	431	" I drink to that ! "
161144	161153	161155	161155	Delia	201	" That 's the thirteenth glass broken tonight ! "
