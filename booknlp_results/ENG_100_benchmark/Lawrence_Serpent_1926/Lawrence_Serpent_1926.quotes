1220	1224	1226	1226	Owen	224	' Why no ! '

1534	1549	1513	1513	Kate	360	' No , I do n't like it . I really hate common people . '

1786	1796	1798	1798	Owen	224	' Yes , I think perhaps it 's wiser , '
1817	1854	1784	1784	Villiers	228	' tidy and ladylike little panama . He glared round coldly , like a bird that would stab with its beak if it got the chance , but which would fly away at the first real menace .

2050	2076	2121	2122	the mob	576	' section . Only a little distance above Kate 's row was a mass of people , as it were impending ; a very uncomfortable sensation .
2112	2119	2121	2122	the mob	576	' La música ! La música ! '
2282	2287	2289	2289	Owen	224	' That 's fine ! '
2291	2319	2289	2289	Owen	224	' But that 's really good ! And it 's the first time I 've heard a good band in Mexico , a band with any backbone . '
2634	2637	2639	2640	the Mexican	622	' No , '
2642	2651	2639	2640	the Mexican	622	' I 'll sit in my own seat . '

2761	2776	2753	2753	Villiers	228	' Why do n't you shove him off , Owen ? Shove him off ? '
2841	2895	2924	2924	he	228	' foot - space . But Villiers was too quick for him . He quickly brought his feet together under the man 's sinking posterior , so the individual subsided uncomfortably on to a pair of boots , and at the same time felt a hand shoving him quietly but determinedly on the shoulder .
2896	2899	2900	2900	Villiers	228	' No ! '
2907	2922	2900	2900	Villiers	228	' This place is for my feet ! Get off ! You get off ! '

3183	3239	3170	3171	the intruder	648	' feet , and Villiers , out of very distaste , had had to extricate his feet from such a compression . The young man 's face went white at the nostrils , and his eyes took on that bright abstract look of pure democratic anger . He pushed the fat shoulders more decisively , repeating :
3240	3248	3182	3182	Villiers	228	' Go away ! Go away ! You 're
3254	3254	3170	3171	the intruder	648	'
3277	3280	3282	3282	Kate	360	' Insolence ! '
3285	3288	3282	3282	Kate	360	' Insolence ! '
3412	3422	3423	3423	she	360	' Do n't you wonder who was his tailor ? '
3452	3466	3433	3433	Villiers	228	' I should say he had n't one . Perhaps did it himself . '
3467	3471	3472	3472	Kate	360	' Very likely ! '
3496	3499	3501	3501	Kate	360	' Triumph ! '
3503	3513	3501	3501	Kate	360	' Ca n't you do the same , Owen ? '
3544	3551	3552	3552	he	224	' Apparently not yet , unfortunately , '
4693	4719	4672	4673	that Pole	727	' Now , Miss Leslie , you are seeing Life ! Now you will have something to write about , in your letters to England . '
4841	4859	4860	4860	she	360	' Why does n't the horse move ? Why does n't it run away from the bull ? '
4874	4884	4885	4885	he	224	' Did n't you see ? It was blindfolded , '
4888	4897	4898	4898	she	360	' But ca n't it smell the bull ? '
4901	4932	4871	4871	his	224	' Apparently not . - They bring the old wrecks here to finish them off . - I know it 's awful , but it 's part of the game . '
4938	4944	4934	4934	Kate	360	' part of the game . '
4974	4976	4934	4934	Kate	360	' brave '
5160	5168	5170	5170	Kate	360	' Run at the men , idiot ! '
5178	5189	5170	5170	Kate	360	' Run at the men , not at the cloaks . '
5190	5200	5202	5202	Villiers	228	' They never do , is n't it curious ! '
5209	5247	5202	5202	Villiers	228	' They say no toreador will face a cow , because a cow always goes for him instead of the cloak . If a bull did that there 'd be no bull - fights . Imagine it ! '
5359	5414	5348	5348	He	694	' gangway . The attendants vaulted over into the arena . The bull trotted in the corridor , then nicely leaped back . The attendants vaulted once more into the corridor . The bull trotted round the arena , ignoring the toreadors , and leaped once more into the gangway . Over vaulted the attendants .
6061	6063	6047	6047	She	360	' I 'm
6066	6071	6047	6047	She	360	' she said , rising .
6072	6075	6076	6076	he	224	' Going ! '
6133	6137	6138	6138	he	224	' Really going ! '
6155	6166	6167	6167	she	360	' I must . I 've got to get out , '
6170	6176	6167	6167	she	360	' Do n't you come . '
6177	6180	6181	6181	he	224	' Really ! '
6211	6226	6227	6227	she	360	' Do n't come ! Really ! I shall take a tram - car , '
6231	6243	6227	6227	she	360	' Really ! Do you think you 'll be all right ? '
6244	6264	6265	6265	He	224	' Perfectly . You stay . Good - bye ! I ca n't smell any more of this stink . '
6384	6397	6409	6409	Irish	227	' They might just as well sit and enjoy somebody else 's diarrhoea '
7292	7299	7300	7300	He	816	' General Viedma ! Don Cipriano ! '
7313	7332	7333	7333	he	816	' I am General Viedma . Did you wish to leave ? Let me get you an automobile , '
7428	7434	7435	7435	she	360	' Thank you so much , '
7447	7459	7460	7460	he	816	' I will send you in the automobile of my friend , '
7463	7481	7438	7438	He	816	' It will be better than a taxi . You do n't like the bull - fight ? '
7482	7487	7489	7489	Kate	360	' No ! Horrible ! '
7491	7505	7489	7489	Kate	360	' But do get me a yellow taxi . That is quite safe . '
7506	7523	7438	7438	He	816	' Well , the man has gone for the automobile . You are English , yes ? '
7524	7527	7529	7529	Kate	360	' Irish , '
7531	7535	7536	7536	he	816	' Ah Irish ! '
7546	7553	7554	7554	she	360	' You speak English awfully well , '
7557	7572	7438	7438	He	816	' Yes ! I was educated there . I was in England seven years . '
7573	7583	7438	7438	He	816	' Were you ! My name is Mrs Leslie . '
7584	7602	7438	7438	He	816	' Ah Leslie ! I knew James Leslie in Oxford . He was killed in the war . '
7603	7613	7438	7438	He	816	' Yes . That was my husband 's brother . '
7614	7618	7438	7438	He	816	' Oh really ! '
7619	7626	7628	7628	Kate	360	' How small the world is ! '
7630	7634	7636	7637	the General	824	' Yes indeed ! '
7644	7657	7438	7438	He	816	' And the gentlemen who are with you , they are - ? '
7658	7661	7663	7663	Kate	360	' American , '
7665	7672	7438	7438	He	816	' Ah Americans ! Ah yes ! '
7673	7684	7438	7438	He	816	' The older one is my cousin - Owen Rhys . '
7685	7708	7438	7438	He	816	' Owen Rhys ! Ah yes ! I think I saw in the newspaper you were here in town - visiting Mexico . '
7764	7775	7777	7777	Kate	360	' They did put in a not very complimentary note , '
7779	7821	7777	7777	Kate	360	' I think they do n't like it that we stay in the Hotel San Remo . It is too poor and foreign . But we are none of us rich , and we like it better than those other places . '
7822	7832	7744	7744	his	824	' The Hotel San Remo ? Where is that ? '
7833	7857	7777	7777	Kate	360	' In the Avenida del Peru . Wo n't you come and see us there , and meet my cousin and Mr Thompson ? '
7858	7901	7744	7744	his	824	' Thank you ! Thank you ! I hardly ever go out . But I will call if I may , and then perhaps you will all come to see me at the house of my friend , Señor Ram n Carrasco . '
7902	7908	7910	7910	Kate	360	' We should like to , '
7912	7923	7744	7744	his	824	' Very well . And shall I call , then ? '
7933	8045	7924	7924	She	360	' You must n't be surprised at the hotel . It is small , and nearly all Italians . But we tried some of the big ones , and there is such a feeling of lowness about them , awful ! I ca n't stand the feeling of prostitution . And then the cheap insolence of the servants . No , my little San Remo may be rough , but it 's kindly and human , and it 's not rotten . It is like Italy as I always knew it , decent , and with a bit of human generosity . I do think Mexico City is evil , underneath . '
8046	8049	8050	8050	he	827	' Well , '
8053	8096	8050	8050	he	827	' the hotels are bad . It is unfortunate , but the foreigners seem to make the Mexicans worse than they are naturally . And Mexico , or something in it , certainly makes the foreigners worse than they are at home . '
8104	8112	8113	8113	she	828	' Perhaps we should all stay away , '
8116	8119	8120	8120	he	827	' Perhaps ! '
8129	8137	8124	8124	his	827	' But I do n't think so . '
8176	8184	8186	8186	Kate	360	' It does n't rain so much , '
8188	8195	8186	8186	Kate	360	' When will the car come ? '
8196	8209	8210	8210	he	827	' It is here now . It has been waiting some time , '
8213	8219	8220	8220	she	828	' Then I 'll go , '
8223	8226	8227	8227	he	827	' Well , '
8235	8254	8227	8227	he	827	' It is still raining , and your dress is very thin . You must take my cloak . '
8255	8258	8259	8259	she	828	' Oh ! '
8264	8271	8259	8259	she	828	' it is only two yards . '
8272	8292	8227	8227	he	827	' It is still raining fairly fast . Better either wait , or let me lend you my cloak . '
8421	8426	8427	8427	she	360	' Good - bye ! '
8430	8451	8427	8427	she	360	' Thank you ever so much . And we shall see you on Tuesday . Do put your cape on . '
8452	8466	8467	8467	he	827	' On Tuesday , yes . Hotel San Remo . Calle de Peru , '
8479	8485	8467	8467	he	827	' The hotel , no ? '
8486	8489	8490	8490	she	360	' Yes , '
8497	8520	8490	8490	she	360	' No , take me to Sanborn 's , where I can sit in a corner and drink tea to comfort me . '
8521	8531	8532	8532	he	827	' To comfort you after the bull - fight ? '
8540	8547	8532	8532	he	827	' To Sanborn 's , Gonzalez . '
8836	8845	8846	8846	he	224	' Oh , how did you get on ? '
8867	8888	8861	8861	his	224	' I got on perfectly . Went to Sanborn 's for tea , and had strawberry shortcake - so good ! '
8889	8896	8897	8897	he	224	' Oh , good for you ! '
8902	8912	8897	8897	he	224	' Then you were n't too much overcome ! I 'm
9003	9007	9009	9009	he	224	'm still alive . '
9026	9032	9033	9033	she	360	' Are n't you drenched ? '
9036	9039	9040	9040	he	224	' Drenched ! '
9043	9146	9040	9040	he	224	' Or at least I was . I 've dried off quite a lot . My rain - coat is no good - I do n't know why I do n't buy another . Oh , but what a time ! The rain streaming on my bald head , and the crowd behind throwing oranges at it . Then simply gored in my inside about letting you go alone . Yet it was the only bull - fight I shall ever see . I came then before it was over . Bud would n't come . I suppose he 's still there . '
9147	9156	9157	9157	she	360	' Was it as awful as the beginning ? '
9160	9225	9040	9040	he	224	' No ! No ! It was n't . The first was worst - that horse - shambles . Oh , they killed two more horses . And five bulls ! Yes , a regular butchery . But some of it was very neat work ; those toreadors did some very pretty feats . One stood on his cloak while a bull charged him . '
9226	9230	9232	9232	Kate	360	' I think , '
9234	9290	9232	9232	Kate	360	' if I knew that some of those toreadors were going to be tossed by the bull , I 'd go to see another bull - fight . Ugh , how I detest them ! The longer I live the more loathsome the human species becomes to me . How much nicer the bulls are ! '
9291	9296	9298	9298	Owen	224	' Oh , quite ! '
9301	9320	9298	9298	Owen	224	' Exactly . But still there was some very skilful work , very pretty . Really very plucky . '
9321	9324	9326	9326	Kate	360	' Yah ! '
9328	9429	9326	9326	Kate	360	' Plucky ! They with all their knives and their spears and cloaks and darts - and they know just how a bull will behave . It 's just a performance of human beings torturing animals , with those common fellows showing off , how smart they are at hurting a bull . Dirty little boys maiming flies - that 's what they are . Only grown - up , they are bastards , not boys . Oh , I wish I could be a bull , just for five minutes . Bastard , that 's what I call it ! '
9430	9433	9435	9435	Owen	224	' Well ! '
9438	9443	9435	9435	Owen	224	' it is rather . '
9444	9449	9451	9451	Kate	360	' Call that manliness ! '
9453	9462	9463	9464	a woman	845	' Then thank God a million times that I 'm
9478	9478	9435	9435	Owen	224	'
9484	9490	9491	9491	she	360	' Go upstairs and change , '
9494	9499	9491	9491	she	360	' You 'll die . '
9500	9538	9480	9480	Owen	224	' I think I 'd better . I feel I might die any minute , as a matter of fact . Well , till dinner then . I 'll tap at your door in half an hour . '
9743	9749	9750	9750	he	228	' Oh it was GREAT ! '
9758	9766	9750	9750	he	228	' GREAT ! They killed seven BULLS . '
9767	9773	9775	9775	Kate	360	' No calves , unfortunately , '
9801	9807	9808	9808	he	224	' No , no calves , '
9811	9830	9808	9808	he	224	' The calves have come home to be fattened . But several more horses after you 'd gone . '
9831	9839	9840	9840	she	360	' I do n't want to hear , '
9890	9894	9895	9895	he	224	' Oh but ! '
9904	9955	9895	9895	he	224	' Do n't you want to hear what I did after ! I went to the hotel of the chief toreador , and saw him lying on his bed all dressed up , smoking a fat cigar . Rather like a male Venus who is never undressed . So funny ! '
9956	9962	9963	9963	she	360	' Who took you there ? '
9966	10023	9895	9895	he	224	' That Pole , you remember ? - and a Spaniard who talked English . The toreador was great , lying on his bed in all his get - up , except his shoes , and quite a crowd of men going over it all again - wawawawawa ! - you never heard such a row ! '
10024	10030	10032	10032	Kate	360	' Are n't you wet ? '
10034	10042	9895	9895	he	224	' No , not at all . I 'm
10074	10090	10060	10060	My	0	' He wiped his thin hair across his head with rather self - conscious humour . '
10097	10100	10093	10093	Owen	224	' he asked .

11272	11286	11288	11288	Kate	360	' His frailty and his aestheticism are both bad signs , to me , '
11291	11301	11303	11303	Owen	224	' And the youth . Surely that 's another ! '
11383	11505	11368	11368	She	252	' Yes ! Yes ! This is Mrs Norris . How are you ? That 's right , that 's right . Now , Mrs Leslie , wo n't you come out to tea this afternoon and see the garden ? I wish you would . Two friends are coming in to see me , two Mexicans : Don Ram n Carrasco and General Viedma . They are both charming men , and Don Ram n is a great scholar . I assure you , they are both entirely the exception among Mexicans . Oh , but entirely the exception ! So now , my dear Mrs Leslie , wo n't you come with your cousin ? I wish you would . '

Ridiculous , this rushing up and down from one altitude to another . I 've lived at this height all these years . I simply refuse to be bundled down to Cuernavaca or some other place where I do n't want to go . Well , my dear , and how are you ? '

13432	13445	13430	13430	Owen	224	' am American . Mrs Leslie is English - or rather Irish . '

13461	13485	13459	13459	Owen	224	' I have n't . American clubs are n't much in my line . Though Garfield Spence gave me a letter of introduction . '
13486	13492	13493	13494	The judge	1005	' Who ? Garfield Spence ? '
13503	13520	13493	13494	The judge	1005	' Why the fellow 's nothing better than a bolshevist . Why he went to Russia ! '

13536	13551	13534	13534	Owen	224	' It is probably the most interesting country in the world to - day . '
13552	13560	13563	13564	Mrs Norris	252	' But were n't you telling me , '
13575	13586	13563	13564	Mrs Norris	252	' that you loved China so much , Mr Rhys ? '
13587	13595	13597	13597	Owen	224	' I did like China very much , '
13599	13602	13567	13567	her	252	' And I 'm

13621	13627	13629	13629	Owen	224	' Perhaps , after all , '
13631	13636	13629	13629	Owen	224	' it was jade . '
13637	13660	13567	13567	her	252	' Ah jade ! Yes ! Jade ! Jade is beautiful ! Those wonderful little fairy - lands they carve in jade ! '
13661	13676	13678	13678	Owen	224	' And the stone itself ! It was the delicate stone that fascinated me , '
13680	13687	13678	13678	Owen	224	' The wonderful quality of it ! '
13688	13712	13567	13567	her	252	' Ah wonderful , wonderful ! Tell me now , dear Mrs Leslie , what you have been doing since I saw you ? '
13713	13726	13728	13728	Kate	360	' We went to a bull - fight , and hated it , '
13730	13752	13728	13728	Kate	360	' At least I did . We sat in the Sun , near the ring , and it was all horrible . '
13753	13792	13567	13567	her	252	' Horrible , I am sure . I never went to a bull - fight in Mexico . Only in Spain , where there is wonderful colour . Did you ever try a bull - fight , Major ? '
13793	13802	13728	13728	Kate	360	' Yes , I have been several times . '
13803	13824	13567	13567	her	252	' You have ! Then you know all about it . And how are you liking Mexico , Mrs Leslie ? '
13825	13829	13831	13831	Kate	360	' Not much , '
13833	13840	13831	13831	Kate	360	' It strikes me as evil . '
13841	13848	13850	13851	Mrs Norris	252	' It does ! It does ! '
13853	13881	13850	13851	Mrs Norris	252	' Ah , if you had known it before ! Mexico before the revolution ! It was different then . What is the latest news , Major ? '
13882	13887	13889	13890	the Major	1007	' About the same , '
13892	13923	13889	13890	the Major	1007	' There is a rumour that the new President will be turned down by the army , a few days before he comes into office . But you never know . '
13924	13941	13944	13944	Owen	224	' I think it would be a great shame not to let him have a try , '
13947	13971	13944	13944	Owen	224	' He seems a sincere man , and just because he is honestly a Labour man , they want to shut him out . '
13972	14002	13944	13944	Owen	224	' Ah , my dear Mr Rhys , they all talk so nobly beforehand . If only their deeds followed their words , Mexico would be heaven on earth . '
14003	14010	14012	14013	the Judge	1005	' Instead of hell on earth , '
14041	14050	14052	14053	Mrs. Norris	252	' We were talking about the new President , '
14055	14061	14063	14064	Mr Henry	261	' Well , why not ! '
14067	14069	14063	14064	Mr Henry	261	' I 'm
14107	14107	14103	14105	Socrates Tomás Montes	262	'
14108	14120	14122	14123	Mrs. Norris	252	' Why , did you ever hear of such a thing ! '
14125	14144	14146	14146	Henry	261	' Hosanna ! Hosanna ! Hosanna ! To the new Labour President . I think it 's rich , '
14163	14170	14172	14173	the Major	1007	' They pasted on my luggage , '
14175	14208	14172	14173	the Major	1007	' when I came through Vera Cruz : La degenerada media clasa , Será regenerada , por mi , Montes . The degenerate middle class shall be regenerated by me , Montes . '
14209	14213	14215	14215	Kate	360	' Poor Montes ! '
14217	14228	14215	14215	Kate	360	' He seems to have got his work cut out . '
14229	14234	14236	14237	Mrs Norris	252	' He has indeed ! '
14239	14267	14236	14237	Mrs Norris	252	' Poor man , I wish he might come in peacefully and put a strong hand on the country . But there 's not much hope , I 'm
14270	14270	14236	14237	Mrs Norris	252	'
14297	14323	14325	14326	the Judge	1005	' How can a man who comes in on a Labour vote , even a doctored one , put a strong hand on a country ! '
14328	14344	14325	14326	the Judge	1005	' Why he came in on the very cry of Down with the strong hand ! '
14389	14411	14413	14414	Mrs Norris	252	' Oh , but may n't it be possible that he will change his views a little on coming into power ? '
14416	14424	14413	14414	Mrs Norris	252	' So many Presidents have done so . '
14425	14439	14441	14442	young Henry	261	' I should say very probable , if ever he gets into power , '
14444	14468	14441	14442	young Henry	261	' He 'll have all his work cut out saving Socrates Tomás , he wo n't have much time left for saving Mexico . '
14469	14483	14485	14486	the Judge	1005	' He 's a dangerous fellow , and will turn out a scoundrel , '
14488	14491	14493	14493	Owen	224	' Myself , '
14495	14515	14493	14493	Owen	224	' as far as I have followed him , I believe he is sincere , and I admire him . '
14516	14524	14526	14526	Kate	360	' I thought it was so nice , '
14528	14543	14526	14526	Kate	360	' that they received him in New York with loud music by the Street Sweepers '
14549	14560	14493	14493	Owen	224	' Band they sent to receive him from the ship ! '
14561	14565	14567	14568	the Major	1007	' You see , '
14570	14584	14567	14568	the Major	1007	' no doubt the Labour people themselves wished to send that particular band . '
14585	14600	14493	14493	Owen	224	' But to be President Elect , and to be received by the Street Sweepers '
14603	14607	14610	14610	I	0	' said Kate . '
14616	14616	14610	14610	I	0	'
14617	14625	14627	14628	the Major	1007	' Oh , it actually was so , '
14630	14640	14627	14628	the Major	1007	' But that is Labour hailing Labour , surely . '
14641	14646	14648	14648	Henry	261	' The latest rumour , '
14650	14675	14648	14648	Henry	261	' is that the army will go over en bloc to General Angulo about the twenty - third , a week before the inauguration . '
14676	14683	14685	14685	Kate	360	' But how is it possible ? '
14687	14694	14685	14685	Kate	360	' when Montes is so popular ? '
14695	14699	14648	14648	Henry	261	' Montes popular ! '
14706	14709	14711	14712	the Judge	1005	' Why ! '
14714	14724	14711	14712	the Judge	1005	' he 's the most unpopular man in Mexico . '
14725	14732	14734	14734	Owen	224	' Not with the Labour Party ! '
14740	14745	14746	14747	the Judge	1005	' The Labour Party ! '
14754	14803	14746	14747	the Judge	1005	' There is no such thing . What is the Labour Party in Mexico ? A bunch of isolated factory hands here and there , mostly in the State of Vera Cruz . The Labour Party ! They 've done what they could already . We know them . '
14804	14809	14811	14811	Henry	261	' That 's true , '
14813	14901	14811	14811	Henry	261	' The Labourites have tried every little game possible . When I was in Orizaba they marched to the Hotel Francia to shoot all the gringoes and the Gachupines . The hotel manager had pluck enough to harangue them , and they went off to the next hotel . When the man came out there to talk to them , they shot him before he got a word out . It 's funny , really ! If you have to go to the Town Hall , and you 're
14965	14965	14972	14975	an access of gout	1035	'
15051	15085	15113	15114	the Major	1007	' work . And when Owen had seen the man in front of him arrested and actually sent to jail , a Mexican jail at that , for refusing to pay the charge , '
15089	15099	15113	15114	the Major	1007	' , he himself had stumped up without a word .
15100	15111	15113	15114	the Major	1007	' I walked into the National Museum the other day , '
15117	15300	15113	15114	the Major	1007	' Just into that room on the patio where the stones are . It was rather a cold morning , with a Norte blowing . I 'd been there about ten minutes when somebody suddenly poked me on the shoulder . I turned round , and it was a lout in tight boots . You spik English ? I said yes ! Then he motioned me to take my hat off : I 'd got to take my hat off . What for ? said I , and I turned away and went on looking at their idols and things : ugliest set of stuff in the world , I believe . Then up came the fellow with the attendant - the attendant of course wearing his cap . They began gabbling that this was the National Museum , and I must take off my hat to their national monuments . Imagine it : those dirty stones ! I laughed at them and jammed my hat on tighter and walked out . They are really only monkeys when it comes to nationalism . '
15301	15304	15306	15306	Henry	261	' Exactly ! '
15308	15324	15306	15306	Henry	261	' When they forget all about the Patria and Mexico and all that stuff , they 're
15343	15631	15113	15114	the Major	1007	're just monkeys . A man up from Mixcoatl told me a nice story . Mixcoatl is a capital way in the South , and they 've got a sort of Labour bureau there . Well , the Indians come in from the hills , as wild as rabbits . And they get them into that bureau , and the Laboristas , the agitator fellows , say to them : Now , Señores , have you anything to report from your native village ? Have n't you anything for which you would like redress ? Then of course the Indians start complaining about one another , and the Secretary says : Wait a minute , gentlemen ! Let me ring up the Governor and report this . So he goes to the telephone and starts ringing : ringing : Ah ! Is that the Palace ? Is the Governor in ? Tell him Señor Fulano wants to speak to him ! The Indians sit gaping with open mouths . To them it 's a miracle . Ah ! Is that you , Governor ! Good morning ! How are you ? Can I have your attention for a moment ? Many thanks ! Well I 've got some gentlemen here down from Apaxtle , in the hills : José Garcia , Jesús Querido , etc . - and they wish to report so - and - so . Yes ! Yes ! That 's it ! Yes ! What ? You will see that justice is done and the thing is made right ? Ah señor , many thanks ! In the name of these gentlemen from the hills , from the village of Apaxtle , many thanks .
15632	15684	15751	15751	she	252	' There sit the Indians staring as if heaven had opened and the Virgin of Guadalupe was standing tiptoe on their chins . And what do you expect ? The telephone is a dummy . It is n't connected with anywhere . Is n't that rich ? But it 's Mexico . '

15703	15713	15751	15751	she	252	' it 's wicked ! It is wicked . I 'm

15729	15732	15734	15735	Mrs Norris	252	' Well , '
15737	15749	15734	15735	Mrs Norris	252	' Mexico is n't like any other place in the world . '
15761	15770	15772	15772	Kate	360	' They seem to want to betray everything , '
15774	15841	15772	15772	Kate	360	' They seem to love criminals and ghastly things . They seem to want the ugly things . They seem to want the ugly things to come up to the top . All the foulness that lies at the bottom , they want to stir up to the top . They seem to enjoy it . To enjoy making everything fouler . Is n't it curious ! '
15842	15847	15849	15850	Mrs Norris	252	' It is curious , '
15852	15860	15862	15863	the Judge	1005	' But that 's what it is , '
15865	15933	15862	15863	the Judge	1005	' They want to turn the country into one big crime . They do n't like anything else . They do n't like honesty and decency and cleanliness . They want to foster lies and crime . What they call liberty here is just freedom to commit crime . That 's what Labour means , that 's what they all mean . Free crime , nothing else . '
15934	15945	15947	15947	Kate	360	' I wonder all the foreigners do n't go away , '
15949	15956	15958	15959	the Judge	1005	' They have their occupations here , '
15961	15986	15988	15989	Mrs Norris	252	' And the good people are all going away . They have nearly all gone , those that have anything left to go to , '
15991	16065	15988	15989	Mrs Norris	252	' Some of us , who have our property here , and who have made our lives here , and who know the country , we stay out of a kind of tenacity . But we know it 's hopeless . The more it changes , the worse it is . - Ah , here is Don Ram n and Don Cipriano . So pleased to see you . Let me introduce you . '
16128	16131	16133	16134	Mrs Norris	252	' Come , '
16136	16145	16133	16134	Mrs Norris	252	' Let us go across and have tea . '
16219	16226	16228	16228	Kate	360	' How lovely it is here ! '
16230	16238	16228	16228	Kate	360	' Having the great dark trees beyond . '
16248	16254	16256	16257	Mrs Norris	252	' Yes it is beautiful , '
16266	16278	16256	16257	Mrs Norris	252	' I have such a time trying to keep these apart . '
16312	16321	16323	16323	Owen	224	' I think the two reds together interesting , '
16325	16330	16332	16333	Mrs Norris	252	' Do you really ! '
16368	16376	16378	16378	Kate	360	' One never sees Popocatepetl nor Ixtaccihuatl , '
16382	16402	16447	16447	Owen	224	' No , not at this season . But look , through the trees there , you see Ajusco ! '
16478	16484	16485	16485	she	360	' Aztec things oppress me , '

16526	16535	16536	16536	he	824	' Perhaps the Aztecs never asked for hope , '
16542	16552	16553	16553	she	360	' Surely it is hope that keeps one going ? '
16556	16573	16574	16574	He	824	' You , maybe . But not the Aztec , nor the Indian to - day . '
16602	16615	16616	16616	she	360	' What do they have , if they do n't have hope ? '
16619	16628	16629	16629	he	824	' They have some other strength , perhaps , '
16633	16642	16643	16643	she	360	' I would like to give them hope , '
16646	16670	16643	16643	she	360	' If they had hope , they would n't be so sad , and they would be cleaner , and not have vermin . '
16671	16679	16680	16680	he	824	' That of course would be good , '
16688	16708	16680	16680	he	824	' But I think they are not so very sad . They laugh a good deal and are gay . '
16709	16712	16713	16713	she	360	' No , '
16716	16740	16713	16713	she	360	' They oppress me , like a weight on my heart . They make me irritable , and I want to go away . '
16741	16745	16807	16807	him	824	' From Mexico ? '
16746	16773	16713	16713	she	360	' Yes . I feel I want to go away from it and never , never see it again . It is so oppressive and gruesome . '
16774	16781	16782	16782	he	824	' Try it a little longer , '
16785	16796	16797	16797	he	824	' Perhaps you will feel differently . But perhaps not , '
16870	16879	16880	16880	he	824	' And does everything in Mexico oppress you ? '
16912	16916	16917	16917	she	360	' Almost everything ! '
16920	16992	16917	16917	she	360	' It always makes my heart sink . Like the eyes of the men in the big hats - I call them the peons . Their eyes have no middle to them . Those big handsome men , under their big hats , they are n't really there . They have no centre , no real I. Their middle is a raging black hole , like the middle of a maelstrom . '
17050	17071	17072	17072	he	824	' You mean we are n't real people , we have nothing of our own , except killing and death , '
17080	17086	17087	17087	she	360	' I do n't know , '
17095	17105	17087	17087	she	360	' I only say how it makes me feel . '
17106	17115	17117	17118	Don Ram	253	' You are very clever , Mrs Leslie , '
17130	17217	17117	17118	Don Ram	253	' It is quite true . Whenever a Mexican cries Viva ! he ends up with Muera ! When he says Viva ! he really means Death for Somebody or Other ! I think of all the Mexican revolutions , and I see a skeleton walking ahead of a great number of people , waving a black banner with Viva la Muerte ! written in large white letters . Long live Death ! Not Viva Cristo Rey ! but Viva Muerte Rey ! Vamos ! Viva ! '
17266	17269	17271	17271	Kate	360	' But , '
17273	17284	17271	17271	Kate	360	' I do n't want to say Viva la Muerte ! '
17285	17293	17294	17294	he	253	' But when you are real Mexican - '
17299	17305	17306	17306	she	360	' I never could be , '

17446	17456	17457	17457	she	360	' Do I call you General or Don Cipriano ? '
17491	17496	17497	17497	he	253	' As you wish , '
17500	17518	17497	17497	he	253	' You know General is a term of disgrace in Mexico . Shall we say Don Cipriano ? '
17519	17529	17530	17530	she	360	' Yes , I like that much the best , '
17799	17808	17809	17810	Mrs Norris	252	' But of course nobody lives without hope , '
17818	17836	17809	17810	Mrs Norris	252	' If it 's only the hope of a real , to buy a litre of pulque . '
17837	17843	17844	17844	he	239	' Ah , Mrs Norris ! '
17859	17867	17844	17844	he	239	' If pulque is the highest happiness ! '
17868	17882	17883	17883	she	252	' Then we are fortunate , because a tost n will buy paradise , '
17886	17896	17898	17899	Don Ram	239	' It is a bon mot , Señora mía , '
17908	17924	17926	17927	Mrs Norris	252	' Now wo n't you try these little native cakes with sesame seeds on them ! '
17934	17958	17926	17927	Mrs Norris	252	' My cook makes them , and her national feeling is flattered when anybody likes them . Mrs Leslie , do take one . '
17959	17963	17965	17965	Kate	360	' I will , '
17967	17974	17965	17965	Kate	360	' Does one say Open Sesame ! '
17975	17980	17982	17983	Mrs Norris	252	' If one wishes , '
17985	17992	17994	17994	Kate	360	' Wo n't you have one ? '
18003	18009	18010	18010	he	276	' Do n't want any , '

18114	18124	18036	18037	Mrs Norris	252	' I did . I thought it very sensible . '
18125	18177	18064	18064	she	252	' The only sensible thing that 's been said about these Agrarian Laws . Sensible ! I should think so . Why Rice Hope came to me , and I put him up to a few things . But his article says everything , does n't miss an item of importance . '
18178	18181	18183	18184	Mrs Norris	252	' Quite ! '
18191	18202	18183	18184	Mrs Norris	252	' If only saying would alter things , Judge Burlap . '
18203	18214	18216	18217	the Judge	1005	' Saying the wrong thing has done all the mischief ! '
18219	18248	18216	18217	the Judge	1005	' Fellows like Garfield Spence coming down here and talking a lot of criminal talk . Why the town 's full of Socialists and Sinvergüenzas from New York . '

18264	18292	18261	18261	she	252	' they do n't come out to Tlacolula , so we need n't think about them . Mrs Henry , let me give you some more tea . '

18376	18441	18373	18373	she	252	' My father had us all speaking four languages by the time we were twelve , and we have none of us ever quite recovered . My stockings were all dyed blue for me before I put my hair up . By the way ! How have you been for walking , Judge ? You heard of the time I had with my ankle ? '
18442	18448	18450	18451	Mrs Burlap	254	' Of course we heard ! '
18484	18484	18477	18477	We	1083	'
18485	18489	18491	18491	Kate	360	' What happened ? '
18493	18561	18562	18562	she	360	' Why I foolishly slipped on a piece of orange peel in town - just at the corner of San Juan de Latrán and Madero . And I fell right down . And of course , the first thing I did when I got up was to push the piece of orange peel into the gutter . And would you believe it , that lot of Mex - '
18567	18596	18562	18562	she	360	' that lot of fellows standing there at the corner laughed heartily at me , when they saw me doing it . They thought it an excellent joke . '
18597	18603	18605	18606	the Judge	1005	' Of course they would , '
18608	18622	18605	18606	the Judge	1005	' They were waiting for the next person to come along and fall . '
18623	18629	18631	18631	Kate	360	' Did nobody help you ? '
18633	18668	18605	18606	the Judge	1005	' Oh no ! If anyone has an accident in this country , you must never , never help . If you touch them even , you may be arrested for causing the accident . '
18669	18675	18677	18678	the Judge	1005	' That 's the law ! '
18680	18706	18677	18678	the Judge	1005	' If you touch them before the police arrive , you are arrested for complicity . Let them lie and bleed , is the motto . '
18707	18712	18714	18714	Kate	360	' Is that true ? '
18719	18723	18724	18724	he	239	' Fairly true , '
18727	18743	18724	18724	he	239	' Yes , it is true you must not touch the one who is hurt . '
18744	18748	18750	18750	Kate	360	' How disgusting ! '
18752	18755	18757	18758	the Judge	1005	' Disgusting ! '
18760	18810	18757	18758	the Judge	1005	' A great deal is disgusting in this country , as you 'll learn if you stay here long . I nearly lost my life on a banana skin ; lay in a darkened room for days , between life and death , and lame for life from it . '
18811	18815	18817	18817	Kate	360	' How awful ! '
18819	18828	18817	18817	Kate	360	' What did you do when you fell ? '
18829	18840	18757	18758	the Judge	1005	' What did I do ? Just smashed my hip . '
18856	18867	18869	18869	Owen	224	' You can hardly blame Mexico for a banana skin , '
18873	18893	18869	18869	Owen	224	' I fell on one in Lexington Avenue ; but fortunately I only bruised myself on a soft spot . '
18894	18904	18906	18907	Mrs Henry	260	' That was n't your head , was it ? '
18909	18912	18914	18914	Owen	224	' No , '
18916	18921	18914	18914	Owen	224	' The other extreme . '

19041	19045	19047	19048	Mrs Norris	252	' One wonders , '
19051	19058	19047	19048	Mrs Norris	252	' what he meant by Americanism . '
19059	19066	19068	19068	Henry	260	' He did n't define it , '
19070	19079	19068	19068	Henry	260	' Cult of the dollar , I suppose . '
19080	19083	19085	19086	Mrs Norris	252	' Well , '
19088	19119	19085	19086	Mrs Norris	252	' The cult of the dollar , in my experience , is far more intense in the countries that have n't got the dollar , than in the United States . '
19143	19152	19153	19153	she	360	' Where is your garden , Mrs Norris ? '
19191	19198	19200	19200	Kate	360	' Is n't this strange stuff ! '
19214	19222	19200	19200	Kate	360	' Is it a sort of jade ? '
19223	19226	19228	19229	the Judge	1005	' Jade ! '
19231	19243	19228	19229	the Judge	1005	' Jade 's green , not black . That 's obsidian . '
19244	19250	19252	19252	Kate	360	' Jade can be black , '
19254	19268	19252	19252	Kate	360	' I 've got a lovely little black tortoise of jade from China . '
19269	19280	19228	19229	the Judge	1005	' You ca n't have . Jade 's bright green . '
19281	19294	19252	19252	Kate	360	' But there 's white jade too . I know there is . '
19310	19316	19307	19307	he	1005	' Jade 's bright green . '
19330	19335	19336	19336	he	224	' What 's that ? '
19339	19348	19350	19350	Kate	360	' Surely there 's more than green jade ! '
19352	19355	19357	19357	Owen	224	' What ! '
19359	19375	19357	19357	Owen	224	' More ! Why there 's every imaginable tint - white , rose , lavender - '
19376	19380	19382	19382	Kate	360	' And black ? '
19384	19417	19420	19420	he	224	' Black ? Oh yes , quite common . Why you should see my collection . The most beautiful range of colour ! Only green jade ! Ha - ha - ha ! '
19452	19463	19465	19466	the Judge	1005	' I 'll catch hold of your arm down here , '
19471	19480	19465	19466	the Judge	1005	' This staircase is a death - trap . '
19674	19682	19685	19685	her	254	' What hotel are you staying at ? '
19687	19698	19683	19683	Kate	360	' I do n't know it . Where is it ? '
19699	19719	19683	19683	Kate	360	' In the Avenida del Peru . You would n't know it , it is a little Italian hotel . '
19720	19726	19683	19683	Kate	360	' Are you staying long ? '
19727	19733	19683	19683	Kate	360	' We are n't certain . '

19743	19751	19683	19683	Kate	360	' No , he 's a poet . '
19752	19761	19683	19683	Kate	360	' Does he make a living by poetry ? '
19762	19771	19683	19683	Kate	360	' No , he does n't try to . '
19820	19865	19683	19683	Kate	360	' Well , good - bye , Mrs Norris ! Wo n't you come and lunch with us ? I do n't mean come out to our house . Only let me know , and lunch with me anywhere you like , in town . '
19866	19883	19884	19885	Mrs Norris	252	' Thank you , my dear ! Thank you so much ! Well ! I 'll see !
19914	19921	19922	19923	Mrs Burlap	254	' How did you come out ? '
19928	19940	19942	19942	Kate	360	' In an old Ford taxi - but where is it ? '
19964	19970	19972	19972	Owen	224	' What a curious thing ! '
19981	19988	19990	19991	Mrs Burlap	254	' Which way do you go ? '
19993	19999	20001	20001	Kate	360	' To the Z calo , '
20003	20015	20017	20028	the baby - faced , withered woman from the Middle - West	1117	' We have to take a tram , the opposite way , '
20096	20102	20104	20105	the Judge	1005	' There you have them , '
20114	20121	20108	20108	his	1005	' There 's the two lots of 'em

20124	20129	20131	20131	Kate	360	' What two lots ? '
20135	20156	20167	20167	he	1005	' Those peon fellows and those obreros , all drunk , the lot of them . The lot of them ! '
20205	20211	20213	20214	the Judge	1005	' Here 's our car ! '
20224	20231	20254	20254	she	1131	' You go the other way , '
20329	20337	20339	20339	Kate	360	' You common - place little woman ! '
20350	20359	20339	20339	Kate	360	' You awful ill - bred little pair . '
20486	20512	20517	20517	He	1144	're baked too much ! said the Lord . So He made another batch , and put them in . They came out white . They 're
20536	20543	20535	20535	They	1145	're just right ! said the Lord .
20632	20641	20642	20642	he	224	' I found the man in a pulquería , '
20645	20664	20642	20642	he	224	' But I do n't think he 's quite drunk . Will you risk driving back with him ? '
20665	20682	20684	20684	Owen	224	' The pulquería was called La Flor de un Día - the Flower of a Day , '
20699	20705	20706	20706	she	360	' We may as well , '
20719	20727	20729	20729	Kate	360	' Do tell him not so fast , '
20731	20738	20740	20740	Owen	224	' I do n't know how , '
20748	20763	20742	20742	He	224	' Hey ! chauffeur ! Not so fast ! Do n't drive so fast . '
20764	20775	20777	20777	Kate	360	' No presto . Troppo presto . Va troppo presto ! '
20802	20809	20811	20811	Owen	224	' He 's only going faster ! '

20870	20880	20882	20882	Owen	224	' Was n't that a ghastly tea - party ! '
20884	20887	20889	20889	Kate	360	' Ghastly ! '

20970	20973	20914	20914	she	360	' fun . '
22746	22796	22739	22747	young misses in bobbed hair and boys ' jumpers	7635	' jumpers were going around , their chins pushed forward with the characteristic , deliberate youth - and - eagerness of our day . Very much aware of their own youth and eagerness . And very American . Young professors were passing in soft amiability , young and apparently harmless .
23008	23015	23017	23017	Owen	224	' Oh , but how wonderful ! '
23175	23179	23181	23181	Kate	360	' Oh no ! '

23215	23252	23212	23213	young Garcia	268	' They must be ugly , no ? Because capitalism is ugly , and Mammon is ugly , and the priest holding his hand to get the money from the poor Indians is ugly . No ? '

23265	23283	23263	23263	Kate	360	' these caricatures are too intentional . They are like vulgar abuse , not art at all . '

23344	23356	23342	23342	Kate	360	' It bores me . One must keep a certain balance . '
23357	23362	23364	23366	the young Mexican	1276	' Not in Mexico ! '
23374	23540	23369	23369	his	1276	' In Mexico you ca n't keep a balance , because things are so bad . In other countries , yes , perhaps you can remain balanced , because things are not so bad as they are here . But here they are so very bad , you ca n't be human . You have to be Mexican . You have to be more Mexican than human , no ? You ca n't do no other . You have to hate the capitalist , you have to , in Mexico , or nobody can live . We ca n't live . Nobody can live . If you are Mexican you ca n't be human , it is impossible . You have to be a socialist Mexican , or you have to be a capitalist Mexican , and you hate . What else is there to be done ? We hate the capitalist because he ruins the country and the people . We must hate him . '
23541	23546	23548	23548	Kate	360	' But after all , '
23550	23621	23548	23548	Kate	360	' what about the twelve million poor - mostly Indians - whom Montes talks about ? You ca n't make them all rich , whatever you do . And they do n't understand the very words , capital and socialism . They are Mexico , really , and nobody ever looks at them , except to make a casus belli of them . Humanly , they never exist for you . '
23622	23634	23636	23636	Garcia	268	' Humanly they ca n't exist , they are too ignorant ! '
23638	23650	23636	23636	Garcia	268	' But when we can kill all the capitalists , then - '
23651	23659	23661	23661	Kate	360	' You 'll find somebody killing you , '
23663	23720	23661	23661	Kate	360	' No , I do n't like it . You are n't Mexico . You are n't even Mexican , really . You are just half Spaniards full of European ideas , and you care for asserting your own ideas and nothing else . You have no real bowels of compassion . You are no good . '
23754	23761	23762	23762	he	7334	' Well ! It may be ! '
23771	23788	23762	23762	he	7334	' Perhaps you know everything . Maybe ! Foreigners , they usually know everything about Mexico . '
23798	23805	23807	23807	Kate	360	' I know what I feel , '
23809	23837	23807	23807	Kate	360	' And now I want a taxi , and I want to go home . I do n't want to see any more stupid , ugly pictures . '
24097	24101	24102	24102	he	268	' I came , '
24118	24236	24102	24102	he	268	' to tell you that I , too , do n't like those caricatures . I , too , do n't like them . I do n't like the young people , boys and girls , no ? - to be seeing them all the time . I , too , do n't like . But I think , also , that here in Mexico we ca n't help it . People are very bad , very greedy , no ? - they only want to get money here , and they do n't care . So we must hate them . Yes , we must . But I , too , I do n't like it . '
24275	24288	24289	24289	she	360	' That 's awfully nice of you to come and say so , '
24296	24302	24303	24303	he	1288	' No , not nice , '
24308	24342	24303	24303	he	1288	' But I do n't know what to do . Perhaps you think I am - different - I am not the thing that I am . And I do n't want it . '
24391	24397	24399	24399	Kate	360	' I know , really , '
24401	24424	24399	24399	Kate	360	' you feel a good deal like I do about it . I know you only pretend to be fierce and hard . '
24425	24428	24429	24429	he	1288	' No ! '
24439	24467	24468	24468	He	1288	' I do also feel fierce . I do hate these men who take , only take everything from Mexico - money , and all - everything ! '
24475	24514	24470	24470	his	1288	' I hate them because I must , no ? But also , I am sorry - I am sorry I have to hate so much . Yes , I think I am sorry . I think so . '
24769	24938	25732	25732	Kate	360	' There was a ferment in the village of Sayula , Jalisco , on the Lake of Sayula , owing to an incident of more or less comic nature , yesterday morning towards mid - day . The women who inhabit the shores of the lake are to be seen each day soon after sunrise descending to the water 's edge with large bundles . They kneel on the rocks and stones , and in little groups , like water - fowl , they wash their dirty linen in the soft water of the lake , pausing at times as an old canoa sails by with large single sail . The scene is little changed since the days of Montezuma , when the natives of the lake worshipped the spirit of the waters , and threw in little images and idols of baked clay , which the lake sometimes returns to the descendants of the dead idolaters , to keep them in mind of practices not yet altogether forgotten .
24939	25038	25732	25732	Kate	360	' As the hot sun rises in the sky , the women spread their washing on the sand and pebbles of the shore , and retire to the shade of the willow trees that grow so gracefully and retain their verdant hue through the dryest season of the year . While thus reposing after their labours , these humble and superstitious women were astonished to see a man of great stature rise naked from the lake and wade towards the shore . His face , they said , was dark and bearded , but his body shone like gold .
25039	25103	25732	25732	Kate	360	' As if unaware of any watchful eyes , he advanced calmly and majestically towards the shore . There he stood a moment , and selecting with his eye a pair of the loose cotton pants worn by the peasants in the fields , that was spread whitening in the sun , he stooped and proceeded to cover his nakedness with the said garment .
25104	25232	25732	25732	Kate	360	' The woman who thus saw her husband 's apparel robbed beneath her eye , rose , calling to the man and summoning the other women . Whereupon the stranger turned his dark face upon them , and said in a quiet voice : " Why are you crying ? Be quiet ! It will be given back to you . Your gods are ready to return to you . Quetzalcoatl and Tlaloc , the old gods , are minded to come back to you . Be quiet , do n't let them find you crying and complaining . I have come from out of the lake to tell you the gods are coming back to Mexico , they are ready to return to their own home . "
25233	25268	25732	25732	Kate	360	' Little comforted by this speech , the woman who had lost her washing was overcome and said no more . The stranger then appropriated a cotton blouse , which he donned , and disappeared .
25269	25306	25732	25732	Kate	360	' After a while , the simple women gathered courage to return to their humble dwellings . The story thus reached the ears of the police , who at once set out to search for the thief .
25307	25631	25732	25732	Kate	360	' The story , however , is not yet concluded . The husband of the poor woman of the lake - shore , returning from his labours in the field , approached the gates of the village towards sunset , thinking , no doubt , of nothing but repose and the evening meal . A man in a black serape stepped towards him , from the shadows of a broken wall , and asked : Are you afraid to come with me ? The labourer , a man of spirit , promptly replied : No , señor ! He therefore followed the unknown man through the broken wall and through the bushes of a deserted garden . In a dark room , or cellar , a small light was burning , revealing a great basin of gold , into which four little men , smaller than children , were pouring sweet - scented water . The astounded peasant was now told to wash and put on clean clothes , to be ready for the return of the gods . He was seated in the golden basin and washed with sweet - smelling soap , while the dwarfs poured water over him . This , they said , is the bath of Quetzalcoatl . The bath of fire is yet to come . They gave him clean clothing of pure white cotton , and a new hat with star embroidery , and sandals with straps of white leather . But beside this , a new blanket , white with bars of blue and black , and flowers like stars at the centre , and two pieces of silver money . Go , he was told . And when they ask you , where did you get your blanket ? answer that Quetzalcoatl is young again . The poor fellow went home in sore fear , lest the police should arrest him for possessing stolen goods .
25632	25731	25732	25732	Kate	360	' The village is full of excitement , and Don Ram n Carrasco , our eminent historian and archaeologist , whose hacienda lies in the vicinity , has announced his intention of proceeding as soon as possible to the spot to examine the origin of this new legend . Meanwhile , the police are watching attentively the development of affairs , without taking any steps for the moment . Indeed , these little fantasies create a pleasant diversion in the regular order of banditry , murder , and outrage , which it is usually our duty to report . '

26930	26958	26928	26928	Owen	224	' whether I ought to put on a dinner - coat . Really , I feel humiliated to the earth every time I put on evening dress . '
26959	26966	26968	26968	Kate	360	' Then do n't do it ! '

27472	27482	27483	27483	he	253	' How do you know I have a hacienda ? '
27486	27497	27460	27460	Kate	360	' I saw it in a newspaper - near Sayula . '
27498	27501	27502	27502	he	253	' Ah ! '
27512	27524	27502	27502	he	253	' You saw about the returning of the Gods of Antiquity . '
27525	27528	27529	27529	she	360	' Yes , '
27532	27541	27529	27529	she	360	' Do n't you think it is interesting ? '
27542	27547	27548	27548	he	253	' I think so , '
27551	27558	27529	27529	she	360	' I love the word Quetzalcoatl . '
27559	27563	27564	27564	he	253	' The word ! '
27577	27586	27588	27593	the pale - faced young Mirabal	1362	' What do you think , Mrs Leslie , '
27605	27626	27627	27627	He	253	' Do n't you think it would be wonderful if the gods came back to Mexico ? our own gods ? '
27656	27662	27663	27663	she	360	' Not those Aztec horrors ! '
27666	27722	27633	27633	his	253	' The Aztec horrors ! The Aztec horrors ! Well , perhaps they were not so horrible after all . But if they were , it was because the Aztecs were all tied up . They were in a cul de sac , so they saw nothing but death . Do n't you think so ? '
27723	27730	27732	27732	Kate	360	' I do n't know enough ! '
27734	27969	27970	27970	He	1363	' Nobody knows any more . But if you like the word Quetzalcoatl , do n't you think it would be wonderful if he came back again ? Ah , the names of the gods ! Do n't you think the names are like seeds , so full of magic , of the unexplored magic ? Huitzilopochtli ! - how wonderful ! And Tlaloc ! Ah ! I love them ! I say them over and over , like they say Mani padma Om ! in Tibet . I believe in the fertility of sound . Itzpapalotl - the Obsidian Butterfly ! Itzpapalotl ! But say it , and you will see it does good to your soul . Itzpapalotl ! Tezcatlipocá ! They were old when the Spaniards came , they needed the bath of life again . But now , re - bathed in youth , how wonderful they must be ! Think of Jehovah ! Jehovah ! Think of Jesus Christ ! How thin and poor they sound ! Or Jesús Cristo ! They are dead names , all the life withered out of them . Ah , it is time now for Jesus to go back to the place of the death of the gods , and take the long bath of being made young again . He is an old - old young god , do n't you think ? '
28000	28009	28010	28010	she	360	' I think it 's a bit overwhelming ! '
28017	28048	27997	27997	she	360	' Ah ! Yes ! Exactly ! Exactly ! But how good to be overwhelmed ! How splendid if something will overwhelm me ! Ah , I am so glad ! '
28084	28088	28090	28091	young Garcia	268	' You see , '
28109	28170	28094	28094	his	268	' we must do something for Mexico . If we do n't , it will go under , no ? You say you do n't like socialism . I do n't think I do either . But if there is nothing else but socialism , we will have socialism . If there is nothing better . But perhaps there is . '
28171	28178	28180	28180	Kate	360	' Why should Mexico go under ? '
28182	28190	28180	28180	Kate	360	' There are lots of children everywhere . '
28191	28257	28094	28094	his	268	' Yes . But the last census of Porfirio Diaz gave seventeen million people in Mexico , and the census of last year gave only thirteen millions . Maybe the count was not quite right . But you count four million people fewer , in twenty years , then in sixty years there will be no Mexicans : only foreigners , who do n't die . '
28258	28266	28268	28268	Kate	360	' Oh , but figures always lie ! '
28270	28276	28268	28268	Kate	360	' Statistics are always misleading . '
28277	28287	28289	28289	Garcia	268	' Maybe two and two do n't make four , '
28291	28316	28289	28289	Garcia	268	' I do n't know if they do . But I know , if you take two away from two , it leaves none . '
28317	28326	28327	28327	she	360	' Do you think Mexico might die out ? '
28333	28336	28337	28337	he	253	' Why ! '
28340	28350	28337	28337	he	253	' It might . Die out and become Americanized . '
28351	28360	28362	28362	Owen	224	' I quite see the danger of Americanization , '
28364	28375	28362	28362	Owen	224	' That would be ghastly . Almost better die out . '
28387	28390	28392	28392	Kate	360	' But ! '
28394	28401	28392	28392	Kate	360	' The Mexicans look so strong ! '
28402	28411	28413	28414	Don Ram	253	' They are strong to carry heavy loads , '
28416	28528	28413	28414	Don Ram	253	' But they die easily . They eat all the wrong things , they drink the wrong things , and they do n't mind dying . They have many children , and they like their children very much . But when the child dies , the parents say : Ah , he will be an angelito ! So they cheer up and feel as if they had been given a present . Sometimes I think they enjoy it when their children die . Sometimes I think they would like to transfer Mexico en bloc into Paradise , or whatever lies behind the walls of death . It would be better there ! '
28534	28541	28543	28543	Kate	360	' But how sad you are ! '
28557	28568	28570	28571	Julio Toussaint	297	' Whoever knows Mexico below the surface , is sad ! '
28581	28584	28586	28586	Owen	224	' Well , '
28588	28696	28586	28586	Owen	224	' it seems to me , on the contrary , a gay country . A country of gay , irresponsible children . Or rather , they would be gay , if they were properly treated . If they had comfortable homes , and a sense of real freedom . If they felt that they could control their lives and their own country . But being in the grip of outsiders , as they have been for hundreds of years , life of course seems hardly worth while to them . Naturally , they do n't care if they live or die . They do n't feel free . '
28697	28702	28704	28704	Toussaint	297	' Free for what ? '
28706	28725	28704	28704	Toussaint	297	' To make Mexico their own . Not to be so poor and at the mercy of outsiders . '
28726	28738	28740	28740	Toussaint	297	' They are at the mercy of something worse than outsiders , '
28742	29010	28740	28740	Toussaint	297	' Let me tell you . They are at the mercy of their own natures . It is this way . Fifty per cent of the people in Mexico are pure Indian : more or less . Of the rest , a small proportion are foreigners or Spaniard . You have then the mass which is on top , of mixed blood , Indian and Spaniard mixed , chiefly . These are the Mexicans , those with the mixed blood . Now , you take us at this table . Don Cipriano is pure Indian . Don Ram n is almost pure Spaniard , but most probably he has the blood of Tlaxcalan Indians in his veins as well . Señor Mirabal is mixed French and Spanish . Señor Garcia most probably has a mixture of Indian blood with Spanish . I myself have French , Spanish , Austrian , and Indian blood . Very well ! Now you mix blood of the same race , and it may be all right . Europeans are all Aryan stock , the race is the same . But when you mix European and American Indian , you mix different blood races , and you produce the half - breed . Now , the half - breed is a calamity . For why ? He is neither one thing nor another , he is divided against himself . His blood of one race tells him one thing , his blood of another race tells him another . He is an unfortunate , a calamity to himself . And it is hopeless .
29011	29131	28704	28704	Toussaint	297	' And this is Mexico . The Mexicans of mixed blood are hopeless . Well then ! There are only two things to be done . All the foreigners and the Mexicans clear out and leave the country to the Indians , the pure - blooded Indians . But already you have a difficulty . How can you distinguish the pure - blooded Indian , after so many generations ? Or else the half - breed or mixed - blood Mexicans who are all the time on top shall continue to destroy the country till the Americans from the United States flood in . We are as California and New Mexico now are , swamped under the dead white sea .
29132	29200	28740	28740	Toussaint	297	' But let me tell you something further . I hope we are not Puritans . I hope I may say that it depends on the moment of coition . At the moment of coition , either the spirit of the father fuses with the spirit of the mother , to create a new being with a soul , or else nothing fuses but the germ of procreation .
29201	29302	28704	28704	Toussaint	297	' Now consider . How have these Mexicans of mixed blood been begotten , for centuries ? In what spirit ? What was the moment of coition like ? Answer me that , and you have told me the reason for this Mexico which makes us despair and which will go on making everybody despair , till it destroys itself . In what spirit have the Spanish and other foreign fathers gotten children of the Indian women ? What sort of spirit was it ? What sort of coition ? And then , what sort of race do you expect ? '
29303	29319	29321	29321	Kate	360	' But what sort of a spirit is there between white men and white women ! '
29323	29327	29329	29331	the didactic Toussaint	297	' At least , '
29333	29347	29329	29331	the didactic Toussaint	297	' the blood is homogeneous , so that consciousness automatically unrolls in continuity . '
29348	29357	29359	29359	Kate	360	' I hate its unrolling in automatic continuity , '
29361	29387	28704	28704	Toussaint	297	' Perhaps ! But it makes life possible . Without developing continuity in consciousness , you have chaos . And this comes of mixed blood . '
29388	29392	29394	29394	Kate	360	' And then , '
29396	29421	29394	29394	Kate	360	' surely the Indian men are fond of their women ! The men seem manly , and the women seem very lovable and womanly . '
29422	29551	28704	28704	Toussaint	297	' It is possible that the Indian children are pure - blooded , and there is the continuity of blood . But the Indian consciousness is swamped under the stagnant water of the white man 's Dead Sea consciousness . Take a man like Benito Juarez , a pure Indian . He floods his old consciousness with the new white ideas , and there springs up a whole forest of verbiage , new laws , new constitutions and all the rest . But it is a sudden weed . It grows like a weed on the surface , saps the strength of the Indian soil underneath , and helps the process of ruin . No , madam ! There is no hope for Mexico short of a miracle . '
29552	29555	29557	29557	Mirabal	296	' Ah ! '
29565	29596	29597	29597	He	296	' Is n't that wonderful , when only the miracle will save us ! When we must produce the miracle ? We ! We ! We must make the miracle ! '
29604	29613	29597	29597	He	296	' Ah , I think that is marvellous ! '
29624	29630	29631	29631	Toussaint	297	' Look at the Mexicans ! '
29635	29817	29631	29631	Toussaint	297	' They do n't care about anything . They eat food so hot with chili , it burns holes in their insides . And it has no nourishment . They live in houses that a dog would be ashamed of , and they lie and shiver with cold . But they do n't do anything . They could make , easily , easily , a bed of maize leaves or similar leaves . But they do n't do it . They do n't do anything . They roll up in a thin serape and lie on a thin mat on the bare ground , whether it is wet or dry . And Mexican nights are cold . But they lie down like dogs , anyhow , as if they lay down to die . I say dogs ! But you will see the dogs looking for a dry sheltered place . The Mexicans , no ! Anywhere , nothing , nothing ! And it is terrible . It is terrible ! As if they wanted to punish themselves for being alive ! '
29818	29830	29832	29832	Kate	360	' But then , why do they have so many children ? '
29834	29942	29631	29631	Toussaint	297	' Why do they ? The same , because they do n't care . They do n't care . They do n't care about money , they do n't care about making anything , they do n't care about nothing , nothing , nothing . Only they get an excitement out of women , as they do out of chili . They like to feel the red pepper burning holes in their insides , and they like to feel the other thing , the sex , burning holes in them too . But after the moment , they do n't care . They do n't care a bit .
29943	30052	29631	29631	Toussaint	297	' And that is bad . I tell you , excuse me , but all , everything , depends on the moment of coition . At that moment many things can come to a crisis : all a man 's hope , his honour , his faith , his trust , his belief in life and creation and God , all these things can come to a crisis in the moment of coition . And these things will be handed on in continuity to the child . Believe me , I am a crank on this idea , but it is true . It is certainly absolutely true . '
30053	30060	30062	30062	Kate	360	' I believe it is true , '
30067	30101	29631	29631	Toussaint	297	' Ah ! you do ! Well then ! Look at Mexico ! The only conscious people are half - breeds , people of mixed blood , begotten in greed and selfish brutality . '
30102	30111	30113	30113	Kate	360	' Some people believe in the mixed blood , '

30127	30148	29631	29631	Toussaint	297	' Some of your serious - minded men . They say the half - breed is better than the Indian . '
30149	30181	29631	29631	Toussaint	297	' Better ! Well ! The Indian has his hopelessness . The moment of coition is his moment of supreme hopelessness , when he throws himself down the pit of despair . '
30212	30217	30219	30219	Mirabal	296	' It is true , '
30226	30295	30219	30219	Mirabal	296	' The Mexicans who have any feeling always prostitute themselves , one way or another , and so they can never do anything . And the Indians can never do anything either , because they have n't got hope in anything . But it is always darkest before the dawn . We must make the miracle come . The miracle is superior even to the moment of coition . '
30384	30449	30379	30379	his	239	' material comfort , at the same time listening , as it were , from the back of his head . His big brown eyes were inscrutable , his face impassive . But when he had anything to say , it was always with a light laugh and a teasing accent . And yet his eyes brooded and smouldered with an incomprehensible , unyielding fire .
30947	30958	30959	30959	she	360	' Do you think one can make this miracle come ? '
30964	30971	30972	30972	he	239	' The miracle is always there , '
30975	30992	30972	30972	he	239	' for the man who can pass his hand through to it , to take it . '
31052	31063	31064	31064	she	360	' It is a strange darkness , the Mexican darkness ! '
31067	31073	31074	31074	he	239	' Do you like it ? '
31077	31084	31085	31085	she	360	' I do n't know yet , '
31088	31092	31085	31085	she	360	' Do you ? '
31093	31159	31040	31040	Cipriano	239	' Yes . Very much . I think I like best the time when the day is falling and the night coming on like something else . Then , one feels more free , do n't you think ? Like the flowers that send out their scent at night , but in the daytime they look at the sun and do n't have any smell . '
31160	31168	31169	31169	she	360	' Perhaps the night here scares me , '
31172	31208	31040	31040	Cipriano	239	' Yes . But why not ? The smell of the flowers at night may make one feel afraid , but it is a good fear . One likes it , do n't you think ? '
31209	31216	31217	31217	she	360	' I am afraid of fear , '
31224	31231	31232	31232	she	360	' You speak such English English , '
31235	31255	31232	31232	she	360	' Nearly all the Mexicans who speak English speak American English . Even Don Ram n does , rather . '
31256	31284	31040	31040	Cipriano	239	' Yes . Don Ram n graduated in Columbia University . But I was sent to England , to school in London , and then to Oxford . '
31285	31290	31232	31232	she	360	' Who sent you ? '
31291	31315	31040	31040	Cipriano	239	' My god - father . He was an Englishman : Bishop Severn , Bishop of Oaxaca . You have heard of him ? '
31316	31319	31321	31321	Kate	360	' No , '
31323	31399	31040	31040	Cipriano	239	' He was a very well - known man . He died only about ten years ago . He was very rich , too , before the revolution . He had a big hacienda in Oaxaca , with a very fine library . But they took it away from him in the revolution , and they sold the things , or broke them . They did n't know the value of them , of course . '
31400	31407	31518	31518	he	1387	' And did he adopt you ? '
31408	31453	31456	31456	he	1387	' Yes ! In a way . My father was one of the overseers on the hacienda . When I was a little boy I came running to my father , when the Bishop was there , with something in my hands - so ! '
31464	31499	31456	31456	he	1387	' I do n't remember . This is what they tell me . I was a small child - three or four years of age - somewhere there . What I had in my hands '
31516	31516	31518	31518	he	1387	'
31539	31708	31709	31709	He	1388	' Well , the Bishop was talking to my father , and he saw what I had got before my father did . So he told me at once , to put the scorpion in his hat - the Bishop 's hat , no ? Of course I did what he told me , and I put the scorpion in his hat , and it did not bite me . If it had stung me I should have died , of course . But I did n't know , so I suppose the alacran was not interested . The Bishop was a very good man , very kind . He liked my father , so he became my god - father . Then he always took an interest in me , and he sent me to school , and then to England . He hoped I should be a priest . He always said that the one hope for Mexico was if she had really fine native priests . '
31714	31725	31727	31727	Kate	360	' And did n't you want to become a priest ? '
31729	31732	31733	31733	he	1388	' No ! '
31737	31740	31733	31733	he	1388	' No ! '
31741	31746	31747	31747	she	360	' Not at all ? '
31750	31913	31733	31733	he	1388	' No ! When I was in England it was different from Mexico . Even God was different , and the Blessed Mary . They were changed so much , I felt I did n't know them any more . Then I came to understand better , and when I understood I did n't believe any more . I used to think it was the images of Jesus , and the Virgin , and the Saints , that were doing everything in the world . And the world seemed to me so strange , no ? I could n't see that it was bad , because it was all so very strange and mysterious , when I was a child , in Mexico . Only in England I learned about the laws of life , and some science . And then when I knew why the sun rose and set , and how the world really was , I felt quite different . '
31914	31922	31733	31733	he	1388	' Was your god - father disappointed ? '
31923	31970	31733	31733	he	1388	' A little , perhaps . But he asked me if I would rather be a soldier , so I said I would . Then when the revolution came , and I was twenty - two years old , I had to come back to Mexico . '
31971	31980	31733	31733	he	1388	' Did you like your god - father ? '
31981	32067	31733	31733	he	1388	' Yes , very much . But the revolution carried everything away . I felt I must do what my god - father wished . But I could see that Mexico was not the Mexico he believed in . It was different . He was too English , and too good to understand . In the revolutions I tried to help the man I believed was the best man . So you see , I have always been half a priest and half a soldier . '
32068	32073	31733	31733	he	1388	' You never married ? '
32074	32165	31733	31733	he	1388	' No . I could n't marry , because I always felt my god - father was there , and I felt I had promised him to be a priest - all those things , you know . When he died he told me to follow my own conscience , and to remember that Mexico and all the Indians were in the hands of God , and he made me promise never to take sides against God . He was an old man when he died , seventy - five . '
32226	32239	32240	32240	he	537	' Your husband was James Joachim Leslie , the famous Irish leader ? '
32247	32253	32240	32240	he	537	' You had no children ? '
32254	32301	32240	32240	he	537	' No . I wanted Joachim 's children so much , but I did n't have any . But I have a boy and a girl from my first marriage . My first husband was a lawyer , and I was divorced from him for Joachim . '
32302	32312	32240	32240	he	537	' Did you like him - that first one ? '
32313	32554	32240	32240	he	537	' Yes . I liked him . But I never felt anything very deep for him . I married him when I was young , and he was a good deal older than I. I was fond of him , in a way . But I - had never realized that one could be more than fond of a man , till I knew Joachim . I thought that was all one could ever expect to feel - that you just liked a man , and that he was in love with you . It took me years to understand that a woman ca n't love a man - at least a woman like I am ca n't - if he is only the sort of good , decent citizen . With Joachim I came to realize that a woman like me can only love a man who is fighting to change the world , to make it freer , more alive . Men like my first husband , who are good and trustworthy and who work to keep the world going on well in the same state they found it in , they let you down horribly , somewhere . You feel so terribly sold . Everything is just a sell : it becomes so small . A woman who is n't quite ordinary herself can only love a man who is fighting for something beyond the ordinary life . '
32555	32563	32737	32737	she	1392	' And your husband fought for Ireland . '
32564	32678	32240	32240	he	537	' Yes - for Ireland , and for something he never quite realized . He ruined his health . And when he was dying , he said to me : Kate , perhaps I 've let you down . Perhaps I have n't really helped Ireland . But I could n't help myself . I feel as if I 'd brought you to the doors of life , and was leaving you there . Kate , do n't be disappointed in life because of me . I did n't really get anywhere . I have n't really got anywhere . I feel as if I 'd made a mistake . But perhaps when I 'm
32705	32705	32699	32699	you	1392	'
32728	32736	32737	32737	she	1392	' And I do n't feel disappointed , '
32747	32772	32737	32737	she	1392	' But I loved him . And it was bitter , that he had to die , feeling he had n't - had n't . '
32994	33005	33006	33006	she	360	' I want to go and look at the flowers , '
33178	33219	33161	33163	an old American	1405	' No man who has n't a strong moral backbone should try to settle in Mexico . If he does , he 'll go to pieces , morally and physically , as I 've seen hundreds of young Americans do . '
33267	33276	33287	33288	Don Ram	239	' There is no such thing as liberty , '
33292	33360	33287	33288	Don Ram	239	' There is no such thing as liberty . The greatest liberators are usually slaves of an idea . The freest people are slaves to convention and public opinion , and more still , slaves to the industrial machine . There is no such thing as liberty . You only change one sort of domination for another . All we can do is to choose our master . '
33361	33374	33287	33288	Don Ram	239	' But surely that is liberty - for the mass of people . '
33375	33401	33287	33288	Don Ram	239	' They do n't choose . They are tricked into a new form of servility , no more . They go from bad to worse . '
33402	33411	33412	33412	she	360	' You yourself - are n't you free ? '
33415	33418	33419	33419	he	1408	' I ? '
33422	33522	33419	33419	he	1408	' I spent a long time trying to pretend . I thought I could have my own way . Till I realized that having my own way meant only running about smelling all the things in the street , like a dog that will pick up something . Of myself , I have no way . No man has any way in himself . Every man who goes along a way is led by one of three things : by an appetite - and I class ambition among appetites ; or by an idea ; or by an inspiration . '
33523	33535	33537	33537	Kate	360	' I used to think my husband was inspired about Ireland , '
33540	33544	33419	33419	he	1408	' And now ? '
33545	33590	33591	33591	she	360	' Yes ! Perhaps he put his wine in old , rotten bottles that would n't hold it . No ! - Liberty is a rotten old wine - skin . It wo n't hold one 's wine of inspiration or passion any more , '
33594	33598	33599	33599	he	1409	' And Mexico ! '
33602	33728	33599	33599	he	1409	' Mexico is another Ireland . Ah no , no man can be his own master . If I must serve , I will not serve an idea , which cracks and leaks like an old wine - skin . I will serve the God that gives me my manhood . There is no liberty for a man , apart from the God of his manhood . Free Mexico is a bully , and the old , colonial , ecclesiastical Mexico was another sort of bully . When man has nothing but his will to assert - even his good - will - it is always bullying . Bolshevism is one sort of bullying , capitalism another : and liberty is a change of chains . '
33729	33737	33739	33739	Kate	360	' Then what 's to be done ? '
33741	33745	33739	33739	Kate	360	' Just nothing ? '
33764	33783	33785	33785	Ram	239	' One is driven , at last , back to the far distance , to look for God , '
33789	33804	33806	33806	Kate	360	' I rather hate this search - for - God business , and religiosity , '
33808	33812	33813	33813	he	239	' I know ! '
33820	33833	33813	33813	he	239	' I 've suffered from would - be - cocksure religion myself . '
33834	33845	33846	33846	she	360	' And you ca n't really " find God " ! '
33849	33866	33846	33846	she	360	' It 's a sort of sentimentalism , and creeping back into old , hollow shells . '
33867	33870	33871	33871	he	239	' No ! '
33875	33955	33871	33871	he	239	' I ca n't find God , in the old sense . I know it 's a sentimentalism if I pretend to . But I am nauseated with humanity and the human will : even with my own will . I have realized that my will , no matter how intelligent I am , is only another nuisance on the face of the earth , once I start exerting it . And other people 's wills are even worse . '
33956	33965	33966	33966	she	360	' Oh ! is n't human life horrible ! '
33969	33995	33966	33966	she	360	' Every human being exerting his will all the time - over other people , and over himself , and nearly always self - righteous ! '
34004	34008	34009	34009	he	239	' To me , '
34012	34092	34009	34009	he	239	' that is just the weariness of life ! For a time , it can be amusing : exerting your own will , and resisting all the other people 's wills , that they try to put over you . But at a certain point a nausea sets in at the very middle of me : my soul is nauseated . My soul is nauseated , and there is nothing but death ahead , unless I find something else . '
34137	34144	34145	34145	she	360	' Oh , people are repulsive ! '
34148	34159	34160	34160	he	239	' My own will becomes even more repulsive at last , '
34163	34212	34160	34160	he	239	' My own will , merely as my own will , is even more distasteful to me than other people 's wills . From being the god in my own machine , I must either abdicate , or die of disgust - self - disgust , at that . '
34213	34217	34218	34218	she	360	' How amusing ! '
34221	34227	34228	34228	he	239	' It is rather funny , '
34232	34236	34237	34237	she	360	' And then ? '
34264	34267	34268	34268	he	239	' Then ! '
34271	34306	34268	34268	he	239	' Then ! - I ask , what else is there in the world , besides human will , human appetite ? because ideas and ideals are only instruments of human will and appetite . '
34307	34311	34313	34313	Kate	360	' Not entirely , '
34315	34321	34313	34313	Kate	360	' They may be disinterested . '
34322	34337	34268	34268	he	239	' May they ? If the appetite is n't interested , the will is . '
34338	34342	34343	34343	she	360	' Why not ? '
34346	34355	34343	34343	she	360	' We ca n't be mere detached blocks . '
34356	34367	34268	34268	he	239	' It nauseates me - I look for something else . '
34368	34375	34343	34343	she	360	' And what do you find ? '
34376	34381	34268	34268	he	239	' My own manhood ! '
34382	34388	34389	34389	she	360	' What does that mean ? '
34394	34409	34268	34268	he	239	' If you looked , and found your own womanhood , you would know . '
34410	34418	34419	34419	she	360	' But I have my own womanhood ! '
34422	34436	34437	34437	he	1411	' And then - when you find your own manhood - your womanhood , '
34446	34530	34437	34437	he	1411	' then you know it is not your own , to do as you like with . You do n't have it of your own will . It comes from - from the middle - from the God . Beyond me , at the middle , is the God . And the God gives me my manhood , then leaves me to it . I have nothing but my manhood . The God gives it me , and leaves me to do further . '

But it may be they pull you down as the earth 's pull of gravitation does , that you can balance on your feet . Maybe they draw you down as the earth draws down the roots of a tree , so that it may be clinched deep in soil . Men are still part of the Tree of Life , and the roots go down to the centre of the earth . Loose leaves , and aeroplanes , blow away on the wind , in what they call freedom .

58443	58503	58222	58222	his	2620	' The men made houses on the shore , and the man on the hill , who was a god , taught them to sow maize and beans , and build boats . But he said to them : No boat will save you , when the dark sun ceases to hold out his dark arms abroad in the sky .
58504	58698	58093	58093	he	2620	' The man on the hill said : I am Quetzalcoatl , who breathed moisture on your dry mouths . I filled your breasts with breath from beyond the sun . I am the wind that whirls from the heart of the earth , the little winds that whirl like snakes round your feet and your legs and your thighs , lifting up the head of the snake of your body , in whom is your power . When the snake of your body lifts its head , beware ! It is I , Quetzalcoatl , rearing up in you , rearing up and reaching beyond the bright day , to the sun of darkness beyond , where is your home at last . Save for the dark sun at the back of the day - sun , save for the four dark arms in the heavens , you were bone , and the stars were bone , and the moon an empty sea - shell on a dry beach , and the yellow sun were an empty cup , like the dry thin bone of a dead coyote 's head . So beware !
58699	58722	58222	58222	his	2620	' Without me you are nothing . Just as I , without the sun that is back of the sun , am nothing .
58723	58759	58093	58093	he	2620	' When the yellow sun is high in the sky , then say : Quetzalcoatl will lift his hand and screen me from this , else I shall burn out , and the land will wither .
58760	58814	58222	58222	his	2620	' For , say I , in the palm of my hand is the water of life , and on the back of my hand is the shadow of death . And when men forget me , I lift the back of my hand , farewell ! Farewell , and the shadow of death .
58815	58888	58093	58093	he	2620	' But men forgot me . Their bones were moist , their hearts weak . When the snake of their body lifted its head , they said : This is the tame snake that does as we wish . And when they could not bear the fire of the sun , they said : The sun is angry . He wants to drink us up . Let us give him blood of victims .
58889	58925	58222	58222	his	2620	' And so it was , the dark branches of shade were gone from heaven , and Quetzalcoatl mourned and grew old , holding his hand before his face , to hide his face from men .
58926	58963	58093	58093	he	2620	' He mourned and said : Let me go home . I am old , I am almost bone . Bone triumphs in me , my heart is a dry gourd . I am weary in Mexico .
58964	59018	58222	58222	his	2620	' So he cried to the Master - Sun , the dark one , of the unuttered name : I am withering white like a perishing gourd - vine . I am turning to bone . I am denied of these Mexicans . I am waste and weary and old . Take me away .
59019	59138	58093	58093	he	2620	' Then the dark sun reached an arm , and lifted Quetzalcoatl into the sky . And the dark sun beckoned with a finger , and brought white men out of the east . And they came with a dead god on the Cross , saying : Lo ! This is the Son of God ! He is dead , he is bone ! Lo , your god is bled and dead , he is bone . Kneel and sorrow for him , and weep . For your tears he will give you comfort again , from the dead , and a place among the scentless rose - trees of the after - life , when you are dead .
59139	59208	58222	58222	his	2620	' Lo ! His mother weeps , and the waters of the world are in her hands . She will give you drink , and heal you , and lead you to the land of God . In the land of God you shall weep no more . Beyond the gates of death , when you have passed from the house of bone into the garden of white roses .
59209	59281	58093	58093	he	2620	' So the weeping Mother brought her Son who was dead on the Cross to Mexico , to live in the temples . And the people looked up no more , saying : The Mother weeps . The Son of her womb is bone . Let us hope for the place of the west , where the dead have peace among the scentless rose - trees , in the Paradise of God .
59282	59295	58222	58222	his	2620	' For the priests would say : It is beautiful beyond the grave .
59296	59363	58093	58093	he	2620	' And then the priests grew old , and the tears of the Mother were exhausted , and the Son on the Cross cried out to the dark sun far beyond the sun : What is this that is done to me ? Am I dead for ever , and only dead ? Am I always and only dead , but bone on a Cross of bone ?
59364	59389	58222	58222	his	2620	' So this cry was heard in the world , and beyond the stars of the night , and beyond the sun of the day .
59390	59423	58093	58093	he	2620	' Jesus said again : Is it time ? My Mother is old like a sinking moon , the old bone of her can weep no more . Are we perished beyond redeem ?
59424	59495	58222	58222	his	2620	' Then the greatest of the great suns spoke aloud from the back of the sun : I will take my Son to my bosom , I will take His Mother on my lap . Like a woman I will put them in my womb , like a mother I will lay them to sleep , in mercy I will dip them in the bath of forgetting and peace and renewal .
59496	59514	58093	58093	he	2620	' That is all . So hear now , you men , and you women of these men .
59515	59553	58222	58222	his	2620	' Jesus is going home , to the Father , and Mary is going back , to sleep in the belly of the Father . And they both will recover from death , during the long long sleep .
59554	59568	58093	58093	he	2620	' But the Father will not leave us alone . We are not abandoned .
59569	59697	58222	58222	his	2620	' The Father has looked around , and has seen the Morning Star , fearless between the rush of the oncoming yellow sun , and the backward reel of the night . So the Great One , whose name has never been spoken , says : Who art thou , bright watchman ? And the dawn - star answering : It is I , the Morning Star , who in Mexico was Quetzalcoatl . It is I , who look at the yellow sun from behind , have my eye on the unseen side of the moon . It is I , the star , midway between the darkness and the rolling of the sun . I , called Quetzalcoatl , waiting in the strength of my days .
59718	59739	58093	58093	he	2620	' Thus the big word was spoken behind the back of the world . The Nameless said : It is time .
59740	59752	58222	58222	his	2620	' Once more the word has been spoken : It is time .
59753	59795	58093	58093	he	2620	' Listen , men , and the women of men : It is time . Know now it is time . Those that left us are coming back . Those that came are leaving again . Say welcome , and then farewell !
59796	59801	58222	58222	his	2620	' Welcome ! Farewell ! '

76061	76196	75986	75987	Doña Carlota	360	' Oh , but he is very human too . But he is a general ; yes , yes , he wants to be in command of the soldiers . And I tell you , he is very strong . He has great power with his regiments . They believe in him , oh , they believe in him . He has that power , you know , that some of the higher types of Indians have , to make many others want to follow them and fight for them . You know ? Don Cipriano is like that . You can never change him . But I think a woman might be wonderful for him . He has lived so without any woman in his life . He wo n't care about them . '
76197	76204	76206	76206	Kate	360	' What does he care about ? '
76208	76211	76212	76213	Doña Carlota	360	' Ah ! '
76233	76246	76230	76230	she	360	' I do n't know . Really , I do n't know . '
76247	76253	76255	76256	Don Ram	239	' The Men of Quetzalcoatl , '
76292	76327	76333	76333	her	360	' Ah , there ! There ! There you have it ! The Men of Quetzalcoatl - that is a nice thing for him to care about ! A nice thing , I say , '
77395	77400	77402	77404	the man behind	3319	' There it is ! '
77406	77411	77402	77404	the man behind	3319	' Jamiltepec , Señorita . '
77419	77419	77425	77425	he	239	'
77442	77448	77450	77450	Juana	334	' Look ! How far ! '
77452	77456	77458	77458	Kate	360	' Another time , '
77460	77470	77458	77458	Kate	360	' I shall come alone , or with Ezequiel . '
77471	77488	77425	77425	he	239	' No , Niña ! Do n't say so . Only my foot hurts this morning . '
77489	77498	77458	77458	Kate	360	' Yes . Better not to bring you . '
77499	77512	77425	77425	he	239	' No , Niña ! I like to come , very much ! '
77724	77730	77732	77736	the man with the basket	3355	' That way , Señorita ! '
77762	77767	77769	77769	he	3355	' We are here ! '
78211	78218	78192	78194	the servant woman	3393	' Pass this way , Señorita . '
78280	78314	78269	78269	she	3393	' So you have come ! And you have walked , walked all the way ? Oh , imagine walking in so much sun and dust ! Come , come in and rest . '
78334	78340	78342	78342	Kate	360	' It is beautiful here , '
78418	78424	78425	78425	Kate	360	' What is that village ? '
78428	78441	78447	78447	her	360	' That one ? That one there ? It is San Ildefonso , '
78451	78458	78459	78459	Kate	360	' But it is beautiful here ! '
78462	78471	78473	78475	the other woman	3048	' Hermoso - sí ! Sí , bonito ! '
78574	78583	78585	78586	Doña Carlota	360	' Come , you will need to rest ! '
78588	78597	78599	78599	Kate	360	' I would like to change my shoes , '
78867	78870	78872	78873	Doña Carlota	360	' Come ! '
78877	78886	78888	78888	she	360	' Are you sure now you are rested ? '
78911	78914	78916	78916	Kate	360	' Perfectly ! '
78918	78954	78916	78916	Kate	360	' How still it seems here ! Except for the drum . Perhaps it is the drum that makes it seem so still . Though I always think the lake makes a sort of silence . '
78955	78961	78963	78964	Doña Carlota	360	' Ah , the drum ! '
78978	78999	78963	78964	Doña Carlota	360	' I can not hear it . No , I can not , I can not bear to hear it . '
79011	79021	79023	79023	Kate	360	' It does hit one rather below the belt , '
79025	79030	79023	79023	Kate	360	' What is it ? '
79031	79044	79071	79072	Doña Carlota	360	' Ah , do not ask me ! It is my husband . '
79059	79066	79023	79023	Kate	360	' Is Don Ram n drumming ? '
79067	79070	79071	79072	Doña Carlota	360	' Drumming ? '
79077	79102	79071	79072	Doña Carlota	360	' No ! Oh no ! He is not drumming , himself . He brought down two Indians from the north to do that . '
79103	79107	79109	79109	Kate	360	' Did he ! '
79136	79146	79147	79147	she	360	' I must talk to somebody , I must ! '
79178	79185	79147	79147	she	360	' May I talk to you ? '
79186	79189	79191	79191	Kate	360	' Do ! '
79196	79205	79206	79206	she	360	' You know what Ram n is doing ? '
79217	79228	79230	79230	Kate	360	' Does he want to bring back the old gods ? '
79233	79236	79238	79239	Doña Carlota	360	' Ah ! '
79252	79347	79238	79239	Doña Carlota	360	' As if it were possible ! As if it were possible ! The old gods ! Imagine it , Señora ! The old gods ! Why , what are they ? Nothing but dead illusions . And ugly , repulsive illusions ! Ah ! I always thought my husband such a clever man , so superior to me ! Ah , it is terrible to have to change one 's idea ! This is such nonsense . How dare he ! How dare he take such nonsense seriously ! How does he dare ! '
79348	79356	79358	79358	Kate	360	' Does he believe in it himself ? '
79360	79367	79369	79370	Doña Carlota	360	' Himself ? But , Señora - '
79380	79408	79369	79370	Doña Carlota	360	' How could he ! As if it were possible . After all , he is an educated man ! How could he believe in such nonsense ! '
79409	79417	79432	79433	Doña Carlota	360	' Then why does he do it ? '
79418	79423	79369	79370	Doña Carlota	360	' Why ? Why ? '
79437	79462	79432	79433	Doña Carlota	360	' I wish I knew . I think he has gone insane , as Mexicans do . Insane like Francisco Villa , the bandit . '
79484	79501	79503	79504	Doña Carlota	360	' All the Mexicans , as soon as they rise above themselves , go that way , '
79506	79617	79503	79504	Doña Carlota	360	' Their pride gets the better of them . And then they understand nothing , nothing but their own foolish will , their will to be very , very important . It is just the male vanity . Do n't you think , Señora , that the beginning and the end of a man is his vanity ? Do n't you think it was just against this danger that Christ came , to teach men a proper humility ? To teach them the sin of pride . But that is why they hate Christ so much , and His teaching . First and last , they want their own vanity . '
79657	79727	79729	79729	Carlota	360	' And now , my husband wants to go to the other extreme of Jesus . He wants to exalt pride and vanity higher than God . Ah , it is terrible , terrible ! And foolish like a little boy ! Ah , what is a man but a little boy who needs a nurse and a mother ! Ah , Señora , I ca n't bear it . '
79741	79755	79757	79757	Kate	360	' But there is something wonderful , too , about Don Ram n , '
79768	79794	79729	79729	Carlota	360	' Wonderful ! Ah yes , he has gifts . He has great gifts ! But what are gifts to a man who perverts them ! '
79795	79805	79807	79807	Kate	360	' Tell me what you think he really wants , '
79809	79906	79907	79907	She	360	' Power ! Just power ! Just foolish , wicked power . As if there had not been enough horrible , wicked power let loose in this country . But he - he - wants to be beyond them all . He - he - he wants to be worshipped . To be worshipped ! To be worshipped ! A God ! He , whom I 've held , I 've held in my arms ! He is a child , as all men are children . And now he wants - to be worshipped - ! '
79970	79974	79975	79975	she	360	' After all , '
79990	80092	79984	79984	her	360	' it is n't your fault . We ca n't be responsible , even for our husbands . I know that , since my husband died , and I could n't prevent him dying . And then - then I learned that no matter how you love another person , you ca n't really do anything , you are helpless when it comes to the last things . You have to leave them to themselves , when they want to die : or when they want to do things that seem foolish , so , so foolish , to a woman . '
80102	80114	80115	80115	she	360	' You loved your husband very much - and he died ? '
80119	80145	79984	79984	her	360	' I did love him . And I shall never , never love another man . I could n't . I 've lost the power . '
80146	80153	79984	79984	her	360	' And why did he die ? '
80154	80282	79984	79984	her	360	' Ah , even that was really his own fault . He broke his own soul and spirit , in those Irish politics . I knew it was wrong . What does Ireland matter , what does nationalism and all that rubbish matter , really ! And revolutions ! They are so , so stupid and vieux jeu . Ah ! It would have been so much better if Joachim had been content to live his life in peace , with me . It could be so jolly , so lovely . And I tried and tried and tried with him . But it was no good . He wanted to kill himself with that beastly Irish business , and I tried in vain to prevent him . '
80290	80307	80308	80308	she	360	' As a woman must try to prevent a man , when he is going wrong , '
80311	80350	80308	80308	she	360	' As I try to prevent Ram n. As he will get himself killed , as surely as they all do , down to Francisco Villa . And when they are dead , what good is it all ? '
80351	80357	80359	80359	Kate	360	' When they are dead , '
80361	80370	80359	80359	Kate	360	' then you know it 's no good . '
80371	80422	80308	80308	she	360	' You do ! Oh , Señora , if you think you can help me with Ram n , do help me , do ! For it means the death either of me or him . And I shall die , though he is wrong . Unless he gets killed . '
80423	80432	80434	80434	Kate	360	' Tell me what he wants to do , '
80436	80528	80434	80434	Kate	360	' What does he think he wants to do , anyhow ? - Like my husband thought he wanted to make a free Ireland and a great Irish people . But I knew all the time , the Irish are n't a great people any more , and you ca n't make them free . They are only good at destroying - just mere stupid destroying . How can you make a people free , if they are n't free ? If something inside them compels them to go on destroying ! '
80529	80574	80308	80308	she	360	' I know ! I know ! And that is Ram n. He wants to destroy even Jesus and the Blessed Virgin , for this people . Imagine it ! To destroy Jesus and the Blessed Virgin ! the last thing they 've got ! '
80575	80589	80434	80434	Kate	360	' But what does he say himself , that he wants to do ? '
80590	80791	80308	80308	she	360	' He says he wants to make a new connection between the people and God . He says himself , God is always God . But man loses his connection with God . And then he can never recover it again , unless some new Saviour comes to give him his new connection . And every new connection is different from the last , though God is always God . And now , Ram n says , the people have lost God . And the Saviour can not lead them to Him any more . There must be a new Saviour with a new vision . But ah , Señora , that is not true for me . God is love , and if Ram n would only submit to love , he would know that he had found God . But he is perverse . Ah , if we could be together , quietly loving , and enjoying the beautiful world , and waiting in the love of God ! Ah , Señora , why , why , why ca n't he see it ? Oh , why ca n't he see it ! Instead of doing all these - '
80817	80823	80824	80824	she	360	' It 's no good ! '
80829	80883	80824	80824	she	360	' I know it 's no good , no matter what we do . They do n't want to be happy and peaceful . They want this strife and these other false , horrible connections . It 's no good whatever we do ! That 's what 's so bitter , so bitter ! '
81139	81147	81148	81148	he	239	' I am pleased to see you , '
81156	81162	81148	81148	he	239	' How did you come ? '
81231	81261	81263	81264	Doña Carlota	360	' You did n't know my husband had become one of the people - a real peon - a Señor Peon , like Count Tolstoy became a Señor Moujik ? '
81272	81278	81280	81280	Kate	360	' Anyway it suits him , '
81282	81285	81287	81288	Don Ram	239	' There ! '
81290	81297	81306	81306	him	239	' Give the devil his dues . '
81386	81396	81398	81399	Doña Carlota	360	' The Señora is like me , Ram n , '
81401	81420	81398	81399	Doña Carlota	360	' She can not bear the sound of that drum . Must it play any more this afternoon ? '
81432	81438	81429	81429	he	239	' After four o'clock only . '
81439	81449	81450	81450	Carlota	360	' Must we have that noise to - day ? '
81453	81463	81464	81464	he	239	' Why not to - day like other days ! '
81491	81548	81473	81473	his	239	' Because the Señora is here : and I am here : and we neither of us like it . And to - morrow the Señora will not be here , and I shall be gone back to Mexico . So why not spare us to - day ! Surely you can show us this consideration . '
81607	81618	81619	81619	he	239	' Why not row with Mrs Leslie on the lake ! '
81638	81645	81647	81647	Carlota	360	' We may not want to , '
81717	81722	81723	81723	she	360	' Oh , yes , '
81726	81734	81723	81723	she	360	' I can start home before then . '
81735	81740	81742	81743	Doña Carlota	360	' No ! No ! '
81750	81776	81742	81743	Doña Carlota	360	' Do n't leave me . Stay with me till evening , and help me to amuse Don Cipriano . He is coming to supper . '
82609	82615	82617	82631	Ram n , standing watching the piece of metal , now cold upon the anvil	3474	' It is the bird ? '
82633	82648	82650	82651	the man	537	' Yes , Patr n ! It is the bird . Is it right ? '
82690	82698	82700	82701	the smith	3476	' I put the wings on after , '
82736	82744	82746	82746	Ram	239	' A little more slender - so ! '
82748	82761	82763	82764	the man	537	' Yes , Patr n ! Yes ! Yes ! I understand , '
82767	82772	82746	82746	Ram	239	' And the rest ? '
82773	82778	82779	82780	The man	537	' Here it is ! '
82806	82813	82779	82780	The man	537	' Lay them on the ground . '
82879	82884	82886	82886	Ram	239	' Now the bird , '
82945	82951	82953	82954	the man	537	' So ! It fits , '
82986	82992	82994	82995	the workman	3487	' I take it away ? '
82998	83002	83003	83004	Ram n	371	' Never mind , '
83022	83027	83028	83028	she	360	' What is it ? '
83032	83039	83003	83004	Ram n	371	' The bird within the sun . '
83040	83046	83003	83004	Ram n	371	' Is that a bird ? '
83047	83053	83003	83004	Ram n	371	' When it has wings . '
83054	83070	83003	83004	Ram n	371	' Ah , yes ! When it has wings . And what is it for ? '
83071	83079	83003	83004	Ram n	371	' For a symbol to the people . '
83080	83085	83003	83004	Ram n	371	' It is pretty . '
83086	83089	83003	83004	Ram n	371	' Yes . '
83090	83094	83096	83097	Doña Carlota	360	' Ram n ! '
83099	83116	83096	83097	Doña Carlota	360	' will you give me the key for the boat ? Martin will row us out . '
83126	83135	83137	83137	Kate	360	' Where did you get that beautiful sash ? '
83159	83162	83163	83163	he	537	' This ? '
83166	83172	83163	83163	he	537	' We wove it here . '
83173	83182	83117	83117	He	537	' And did you make the sandals too ? '
83183	83198	83163	83163	he	537	' Yes ! They were made by Manuel . Later I will show you . '
83199	83221	83117	83117	He	537	' Oh , I should like to see ! - They are beautiful , do n't you think , Doña Carlota ? '
83222	83269	83163	83163	he	537	' Yes ! Yes ! It is true . But whether beautiful things are wise things , I do n't know . So much I do n't know , Señora . Ay , so much ! - And you , do you know what is wise ? '
83270	83273	83275	83275	Kate	360	' I ? '
83277	83285	83275	83275	Kate	360	' I do n't care very much . '
83286	83306	83163	83163	he	537	' Ah ! You do n't care ! - You think Ram n is wise , to wear the peasants '
83313	83323	83163	83163	he	537	' For once Doña Carlota was speaking in slow English .
83324	83329	83331	83331	Kate	360	' Oh , yes ! '
83333	83357	83331	83331	Kate	360	' He looks so handsome ! - Men 's clothes are so hideous , and Don Ram n looks so handsome in those ! '
83377	83380	83382	83383	Doña Carlota	360	' Ah ! '
83406	83414	83382	83383	Doña Carlota	360	' Shall we go to the lake ? '
83525	83531	83533	83533	Ram	371	' How is it going ? '
83535	83540	83499	83509	A fattish young man with curly hair , wearing an artist	3499	' Yes - well - '

83844	83848	83849	83849	he	239	' Now you ! '
83961	83966	83968	83968	Ram	371	' It is good ! '

85390	85402	85237	85237	he	371	' And worlds arise as dreams , and are gone as dreams .
85403	85415	85237	85237	he	371	' And man is a dream in the sleep of the Snake .
85416	85427	85237	85237	he	371	' And only the sleep that is dreamless breathes I Am !
85428	85436	85237	85237	he	371	' In the dreamless Now , I Am .
85437	85451	85237	85237	he	371	' Dreams arise as they must arise , and man is a dream arisen .
85452	85479	85237	85237	he	371	' But the dreamless plasm of the Snake is the plasm of a man , of his body , his soul , and his spirit at one .
85480	85500	85237	85237	he	371	' And the perfect sleep of the Snake I Am is the plasm of a man , who is whole .
85501	85531	85237	85237	he	371	' When the plasm of the body , and the plasm of the soul , and the plasm of the spirit are at one , in the Snake I Am .

85537	85559	85237	85237	he	371	' Was - not is a dream , and shall - be is a dream , like two separate , heavy feet .

85567	85589	85237	85237	he	371	' The trees put forth their leaves in their sleep , and flowering emerge out of dreams , into pure I Am .
85590	85612	85237	85237	he	371	' The birds forget the stress of their dreams , and sing aloud in the Now , I Am ! I Am !
85613	85630	85237	85237	he	371	' For dreams have wings and feet , and journeys to take , and efforts to make .
85631	85650	85237	85237	he	371	' But the glimmering Snake of the Now is wingless and footless , and undivided , and perfectly coiled .
85651	85679	85237	85237	he	371	' It is thus the cat lies down , in the coil of Now , and the cow curves round her nose to her belly , lying down .
85680	85717	85237	85237	he	371	' In the feet of a dream the hare runs uphill . But when he pauses , the dream has passed , he has entered the timeless Now , and his eyes are the wide I Am .
85718	85743	85237	85237	he	371	' Only man dreams , dreams , and dreams , and changes from dream to dream , like a man who tosses on his bed .
85744	85780	85237	85237	he	371	' With his eyes and his mouth he dreams , with his hands and his feet , with phallos and heart and belly , with body and spirit and soul , in a tempest of dreams .
85781	85796	85237	85237	he	371	' And rushes from dream to dream , in the hope of the perfect dream .
85797	85829	85237	85237	he	371	' But I , I say to you , there is no dream that is perfect , for every dream has an ache and an urge , an urge and an ache .
85830	85847	85237	85237	he	371	' And nothing is perfect , save the dream pass out into the sleep , I Am .
85848	85862	85237	85237	he	371	' When the dream of the eyes is darkened , and encompassed with Now .
85863	85876	85237	85237	he	371	' And the dream of the mouth resounds in the last I Am .
85877	85905	85237	85237	he	371	' And the dream of the hands is a sleep like a bird on the sea , that sleeps and is lifted and shifted , and knows not .

85928	85941	85237	85237	he	371	' And the dream of the phallos reaches the great I Know Not .
85942	85958	85237	85237	he	371	' And the dream of the body is the stillness of a flower in the dark .
85959	85973	85237	85237	he	371	' And the dream of the soul is gone in the perfume of Now .
85974	85996	85237	85237	he	371	' And the dream of the spirit lapses , and lays down its head , and is still with the Morning Star .
85997	86011	85237	85237	he	371	' For each dream starts out of Now , and is accomplished in Now .
86012	86025	85237	85237	he	371	' In the core of the flower , the glimmering , wakeless Snake .
86026	86054	85237	85237	he	371	' And what falls away is a dream , and what accrues is a dream . There is always and only Now , Now and I Am . '

Lords of the day and night . Sons of the Morning Star , sons of the Evening Star . Men of the Morning and the Evening Star .
86517	86545	86402	86402	You	3560	' We are not lords of men : how can men make us lords ? Nor are we masters of men , for men are not worth it .
86546	86594	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' But I am the Morning and the Evening Star , and lord of the day and the night . By the power that is put in my left hand , and the power that I grasp in my right , I am lord of the two ways .
86595	86612	86402	86402	You	3560	' And my flower on earth is the jasmine flower , and in heaven the flower Hesperus .
86613	86633	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' I will not command you , nor serve you , for the snake goes crooked to his own house .

86649	86752	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' There is no giving , and no taking . When the fingers that give touch the fingers that receive , the Morning Star shines at once , from the contact , and the jasmine gleams between the hands . And thus there is neither giving nor taking , nor hand that proffers nor hand that receives , but the star between them is all , and the dark hand and the light hand are invisible on each side . The jasmine takes the giving and the receiving in her cup , and the scent of the oneness is fragrant on the air .
86753	86767	86402	86402	You	3560	' Think neither to give nor to receive , only let the jasmine flower .
86768	86783	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' Let nothing spill from you in excess , let nothing be reived from you .
86784	86811	86402	86402	You	3560	' And reive nothing away . Not even the scent from the rose , nor the juice from the pomegranate , nor the warmth from the fire .
86812	86853	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' But say to the rose : Lo ! I take you away from your tree , and your breath is in my nostrils , and my breath is warm in your depths . Let it be a sacrament between us .
86854	86888	86402	86402	You	3560	' And beware when you break the pomegranate ; it is sunset you take in your hands . Say : I am coming , come thou . Let the Evening Star stand between us .
86889	86990	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' And when the fire burns up and the wind is cold and you spread your hands to the blaze , listen to the flame saying : Ah ! Is it thou ? Comest thou to me ? Lo , I was going the longest journey , down the path of the greatest snake . But since thou comest to me , I come to thee . And where thou fallest into my hands , fall I into thine , and jasmine flowers on the burning bush between us . Our meeting is the burning bush , whence the jasmine flowers .
86991	87023	86402	86402	You	3560	' Reive nothing away , and let nothing be reived from you . For reiver and bereaved alike break the root of the jasmine flower , and spit upon the Evening Star .
87024	87044	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' Take nothing , to say : I have it ! For you can possess nothing , not even peace .
87045	87074	86402	86402	You	3560	' Nought is possessible , neither gold , nor land , nor love , nor life , nor peace , nor even sorrow nor death , nor yet salvation .

87084	87092	86402	86402	You	3560	' Say only : It is with me .
87093	87139	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' For the gold that is with thee lingers as a departing moon , looking across space thy way , saying : Lo ! We are beholden of each other . Lo ! for this little while , to each other thou and I are beholden .
87140	87199	86402	86402	You	3560	' And thy land says to thee : Ah , my child of a far - off father ! Come , lift me , lift me a little while , that poppies and wheat may blow on the level wind that moves between my breast and thine ! Then sink with me , and we will make one mound .
87200	87267	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' And listen to thy love saying : Beloved ! I am mown by thy sword like mown grass , and darkness is upon me , and the tremble of the Evening Star . And to me thou art darkness and nowhere . Oh thou , when thou risest up and goest thy way , speak to me , only say : The star rose between us .
87268	87329	86402	86402	You	3560	' And say to thy life : Am I thine ? Art thou mine ? Am I the blue curve of day around thine uncurved night ? Are my eyes twilight of neither of us , where the star hangs ? Is my upper lip the sunset and my lower lip the dawn , does the star tremble inside my mouth ?
87330	87360	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' And say to thy peace : Ah ! risen , deathless star ! Already the waters of dawn sweep over thee , and wash me away on the flood !
87361	87375	86402	86402	You	3560	' And say to thy sorrow : Axe , thou art cutting me down !
87376	87390	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' Yet did a spark fly from out of thy edge and my wound !
87391	87405	86402	86402	You	3560	' Cut then , while I cover my face , father of the Star .
87406	87481	86447	86448	Ram n	371	' And say to thy strength : Lo , the night is foaming up my feet and my loins , day is foaming down from my eyes and my mouth to the sea of my breast . Lo , they meet ! My belly is a flood of power , that races in down the sluice of bone at my back , and a star hangs low on the flood , over a troubled dawn .
87482	87519	86402	86402	You	3560	' And say to thy death : Be it so ! I , and my soul , we come to thee , Evening Star . Flesh , go thou into the night . Spirit , farewell , '
87539	87539	87570	87570	Ram	371	'
87818	87833	87814	87814	She	360	' Ram n ! Ram n ! Have you finished ? Cipriano is here . '
88033	88048	88017	88017	his	371	' Qué tal ? " he said , from the edge of his lips . '
88053	88053	88017	88017	his	371	'
88060	88148	88017	88017	his	371	' said Cipriano , still gazing into the other man 's face with black , wondering , childlike , searching eyes , as if he , Cipriano , were searching for himself , in Ram n 's face . Ram n looked back into Cipriano 's black , Indian eyes with a faint , kind smile of recognition , and Cipriano hung his head as if to hide his face , the black hair , which he wore rather long and brushed sideways , dropping over his forehead .
88216	88223	88225	88225	Ram	371	' You rowed on the lake ? '
88232	88237	88239	88239	Kate	360	' It was lovely ! '
88241	88249	88239	88239	Kate	360	' But hot when the sun came . '
88828	88839	88841	88841	Kate	360	' Birds in this country have all their colour below , '
88850	88860	88861	88861	he	371	' They say the word Mexico means below this ! '

89325	89507	89320	89320	she	360	' Let me close my eyes to him , and open only my soul . Let me close my prying , seeing eyes , and sit in dark stillness along with these two men . They have got more than I , they have a richness that I have n't got . They have got rid of that itching of the eye , and the desire that works through the eye . The itching , prurient , knowing , imagining eye , I am cursed with it , I am hampered up in it . It is my curse of curses , the curse of Eve . The curse of Eve is upon me , my eyes are like hooks , my knowledge is like a fish - hook through my gills , pulling me in spasmodic desire . Oh , who will free me from the grappling of my eyes , from the impurity of sharp sight ! Daughter of Eve , of greedy vision , why do n't these men save me from the sharpness of my own eyes ! '
89591	89595	89598	89599	Doña Carlota	360	' Ram n ! '
89603	89611	89598	89599	Doña Carlota	360	' Wo n't you put something on ? '
89623	89632	89634	89634	Ram	239	' Yes ! Thank you for the tea , '
89663	89669	89674	89674	Carlota	360	' Oh , Señora Caterina ! '
89676	89685	89674	89674	Carlota	360	' Come and drink your tea . Come ! '
89694	89702	89686	89686	Kate	360	' It seems so wonderfully peaceful here . '
89703	89706	89708	89708	Carlota	360	' Peaceful ! '
89710	89731	89708	89708	Carlota	360	' Ah , I do not find it peaceful . There is a horrible stillness , which makes me afraid . '
89732	89740	89742	89742	Kate	360	' Do you come out very often ? '
89746	89759	89760	89760	he	239	' Yes . Fairly often . Once a week . Or twice , '
89804	89812	89813	89813	she	360	' I must be going home now , '
89816	89823	89813	89813	she	360	' The sun will be setting . '

89849	89855	89833	89833	his	239	' Will you go already ? '
89856	89863	89865	89865	Carlota	360	' Oh , no , Señora ! '
89867	89887	89865	89865	Carlota	360	' Stay until to - morrow . Oh , yes , stay until to - morrow , with me . '
89888	89895	89896	89896	she	360	' They will expect us home , '
89901	89932	89934	89934	she	360	' Ah , no ! I can send a boy to say you will come to - morrow . Yes ? You will stay ? Ah , good , good ! '
89968	89974	89975	89975	she	360	' Shall I take one ? '
89978	89984	89975	89975	she	360	' It is my vice . '
89985	89990	89991	89991	he	239	' Do take one , '
89994	90003	89991	89991	he	239	' It is n't good to be perfect . '
90004	90012	90013	90013	she	360	' It is n't , is it ? '
90020	90028	90029	90029	he	239	' Now would you call it peace ? '
90035	90038	90039	90039	she	360	' Why ? '
90042	90051	90052	90052	he	239	' Why do white people always want peace ? '
90055	90072	90017	90017	her	360	' Surely peace is natural ! Do n't all people want it ? Do n't you ? '
90073	90082	90083	90083	he	239	' Peace is only the rest after war , '
90086	90101	90083	90083	he	239	' So it is not more natural than fighting : perhaps not so natural . '
90102	90124	90017	90017	her	360	' No , but there is another peace : the peace that passes all understanding . Do n't you know that ? '
90125	90133	90134	90134	he	239	' I do n't think I do , '
90137	90142	90143	90143	she	360	' What a pity ! '
90146	90149	90150	90150	he	239	' Ah ! '
90153	90242	90150	90150	he	239	' You want to teach me ! But to me it is different . Each man has two spirits in him . The one is like the early morning in the time of rain , very quiet , and sweet , moist , no ? - with the mocking - bird singing , and birds flying about , very fresh . And the other is like the dry season , the steady , strong hot light of the day , which seems as if it will never change . '
90243	90251	90252	90252	she	360	' But you like the first better , '
90255	90261	90262	90262	he	239	' I do n't know ! '
90265	90271	90262	90262	he	239	' The other lasts longer . '
90272	90283	90284	90284	she	360	' I am sure you like the fresh morning better , '
90298	90317	90293	90293	I	0	' He smiled a crumpled sort of smile , and she could tell he really did not know . '
90458	90458	90507	90507	his	1089	'
90459	90467	90469	90469	Kate	360	' And then what does he want ? '
90471	90493	90507	90507	his	1089	' I do n't know . Perhaps he wants to be a very big man , and master all the people . '
90494	90501	90503	90503	Kate	360	' Then why does n't he ? '
90510	90514	90515	90515	he	1089	' And you , '
90520	90533	90515	90515	he	1089	' You seem to me like that morning I told you about . '
90534	90542	90543	90543	she	360	' I am just forty years old , '
90553	90559	90560	90560	he	1089	' It does n't matter , '
90563	90602	90548	90548	he	1089	' It is the same . Your body seems to me like the stem of the flower I told you about , and in your face it will always be morning , of the time of the rains . '
90603	90612	90613	90613	she	360	' Why do you say that to me ? '
90624	90630	90631	90631	he	1089	' Why not say it ! '
90634	90658	90631	90631	he	1089	' You are like the cool morning , very fresh . In Mexico , we are the end of the hot dry day . '
90701	90709	90710	90710	he	1089	' I would like to marry you , '
90713	90727	90710	90710	he	1089	' if ever you will marry . I would like to marry you . '
90728	90739	90740	90740	she	360	' I do n't think I shall ever marry again , '
90762	90766	90768	90768	he	1089	' Who knows ! '
90842	90849	90850	90850	he	239	' I told the Señora Caterina , '
90853	90868	90850	90850	he	239	' if ever she wanted to marry a man , she should marry me . '
90869	90875	90877	90877	Ram	239	' It is plain talk , '
90959	90970	90971	90971	she	360	' Don Cipriano says that white people always want peace , '
90983	90992	90993	90993	she	360	' Do n't you consider yourselves white people ? '
91003	91010	91012	91012	Ram	239	' No whiter than we are , '
91014	91023	91012	91012	Ram	239	' Not lily - white , at least . '
91024	91032	91033	91033	she	360	' And do n't you want peace ? '
91036	91102	91012	91012	Ram	239	' I ? I should n't think of it . The meek have inherited the earth , according to prophecy . But who am I , that I should envy them their peace ! No , Señora . Do I look like a gospel of peace ? - or a gospel of war either ? Life does n't split down that division , for me . '
91103	91112	91114	91114	she	360	' I do n't know what you want , '
91124	91131	91132	91132	he	239	' We only half know ourselves , '
91140	91148	91132	91132	he	239	' Perhaps not so much as half . '

91211	91221	91222	91222	she	360	' I think it is beautiful to look at , '
91225	91227	91222	91222	she	360	' But '

92235	92238	92184	92184	Cipriano	379	' Why ? '
92239	92261	92184	92184	Cipriano	379	' Perhaps that you could give him your moral support . Perhaps that you might be Secretary , and President when Montes '

92296	92339	92294	92294	Cipriano	379	' More or less . He is suspicious , and jealous for fear anyone else might want to share in his power . He has the cravings of a dictator . He wanted to find out if I would stick to him . '
92340	92348	92184	92184	Cipriano	379	' You let him know you would ? '
92349	92365	92294	92294	Cipriano	379	' I told him that all I cared for was for you and for Mexico . '
92366	92372	92184	92184	Cipriano	379	' What did he say ? '
92373	92527	92294	92294	Cipriano	379	' Well , he is no fool . He said : " Don Ram n sees the world with different eyes from mine . Who knows which of us is right ? I want to save my country from poverty and unenlightenment , he wants to save its soul . I say , a hungry and ignorant man has no place for a soul . An empty belly grinds upon itself , so does an empty mind , and the soul does n't exist . Don Ram n says , if a man has no soul , it does n't matter whether he is hungry or ignorant . Well , he can go his way , and I mine . We shall never hinder one another , I believe . I give you my word I wo n't have him interfered with . He sweeps the patio and I sweep the street . " '
92528	92531	92533	92533	Ram	239	' Sensible ! '
92535	92542	92294	92294	Cipriano	379	' And honest in his convictions . '

92563	92566	92294	92294	Cipriano	379	' said Cipriano .
92567	92638	92294	92294	Cipriano	379	' You know I do n't want that . I must stand in another world , and act in another world . - Politics must go their own way , and society must do as it will . Leave me alone , Cipriano . I know you want me to be another Porfirio Diaz , or something like that . But for me that would be failure pure and simple . '
92678	92690	92691	92691	he	239	' I do n't understand , myself , what you want , '
92694	92981	92982	92982	Cipriano	239	' Yes , yes , you do . Politics and all this social religion that Montes has got is like washing the outside of the egg , to make it look clean . But I , myself , I want to get inside the egg , right to the middle , to start it growing into a new bird . Ay ! Cipriano ! Mexico is like an old , old egg that the bird of Time laid long ago ; and she has been sitting on it for centuries , till it looks foul in the nest of the world . But still , Cipriano , it is a good egg . It is not addled . Only the spark of fire has never gone into the middle of it , to start it . - Montes wants to clean the nest and wash the egg . But meanwhile , the egg will go cold and die . The more you save these people from poverty and ignorance , the quicker they will die : like a dirty egg that you take from under the hen - eagle , to wash it . While you wash the egg , it chills and dies . Poor old Montes , all his ideas are American and European . And the old Dove of Europe will never hatch the egg of dark - skinned America . The United States ca n't die , because it is n't alive . It is a nestful of china eggs , made of pot . So they can be kept clean . - But here , Cipriano , here , let us hatch the chick before we start cleaning up the nest . '
93036	93103	93104	93104	Cipriano	239	' It is no good , trying to mix the two things . At this stage of affairs , at least , they wo n't mix . We have to shut our eyes and sink down , sink away from the surface , away , like shadows , down to the bottom . Like the pearl divers . But you keep bobbing up like a cork . '
93113	93151	93153	93153	Ram	239	' We 've got to open the oyster of the cosmos , and get our manhood out of it . Till we 've got the pearl , we are only gnats on the surface of the ocean , '
93155	93165	93167	93167	Cipriano	239	' My manhood is like a devil inside me , '
93169	93175	93177	93177	Ram	239	' It 's very true , '
93179	93203	93177	93177	Ram	239	' That 's because the old oyster has him shut up , like a black pearl . You must let him walk out . '
93204	93208	93210	93210	Cipriano	239	' Ram n , '
93212	93246	93210	93210	Cipriano	239	' would n't it be good to be a serpent , and be big enough to wrap one 's folds round the globe of the world , and crush it like that egg ? '
93255	93263	93265	93265	Cipriano	239	' I believe we could do that , '
93275	93283	93272	93272	his	239	' And would n't it be good ? '
93292	93303	93304	93304	he	239	' There would be one good moment , at least , '
93307	93313	93315	93315	Cipriano	239	' Who asks for more ! '
93338	93345	93346	93346	he	239	' What would be the good ! '
93350	93382	93346	93346	he	239	' If the egg was crushed , and we remained , what could we do but go howling down the empty passages of darkness ? What 's the good , Cipriano ? '
93454	93465	93467	93468	Ram n	239	' My manhood is like a demon howling inside me , '

95422	95554	95419	95419	he	371	' and I tell you truly . At the heart of this earth sleeps a great serpent , in the midst of fire . Those that go down in mines feel the heat and the sweat of him , they feel him move . It is the living fire of the earth , for the earth is alive . The snake of the world is huge , and the rocks are his scales , trees grow between them . I tell you the earth you dig is alive as a snake that sleeps . So vast a serpent you walk on , this lake lies between his folds as a drop of rain in the folds of a sleeping rattlesnake . Yet he none the less lives . The earth is alive .
95555	95610	95389	95389	He	371	' And if he died , we should all perish . Only his living keeps the soil sweet , that grows you maize . From the roots of his scales we dig silver and gold , and the trees have root in him , as the hair of my face has root in my lips .
95611	95721	95419	95419	he	371	' The earth is alive . But he is very big and we are very small , smaller than dust . But he is very big in his life , and sometimes he is angry . These people , smaller than dust , he says , they stamp on me and say I am dead . Even to their asses they speak , and shout Harreh ! Burro ! But to me they speak no word . Therefore I will turn against them , like a woman who lies angry with her man in bed , and eats away his spirit with her anger , turning her back to him .
95722	95744	95389	95389	He	371	' That is what the earth says to us . He sends sorrow into our feet , and depression into our loins .
95745	95786	95419	95419	he	371	' Because as an angry woman in the house can make a man heavy , taking his life from him , so the earth can make us heavy , make our souls cold , and our life dreary in our feet .
95787	95853	95389	95389	He	371	' Speak then to the snake of the heart of the world , put oil on your fingers and lower your fingers for him to taste the oil of the earth , and let him send life into your feet and ankles and knees , like sap in the young maize pressing against the joint and making the milk of the maize bud among its hair .

98998	99053	98995	98995	he	239	' when Ram n tells the people the earth is alive , and the sky has a big bird in it , that you do n't see . I think it is true . Certainly ! And it is good to know it , because then one is on the qui vive , no ? '
99054	99067	99068	99068	she	360	' But it 's tiring to be always on the qui vive , '
99071	99125	98995	98995	he	239	' Why ? Why tiring ? No , I think , on the contrary , it is refreshing . - Ah , you should marry , and live in Mexico . At last , I am sure , you would like it . You would keep waking up more and more to it . '
99126	99135	99136	99136	she	360	' Or else going more and more deadened , '
99139	99152	99136	99136	she	360	' That is how most foreigners go , it seems to me . '
99153	99157	99158	99158	he	239	' Why deadened ? '
99163	99249	99158	99158	he	239	' I do n't understand . Why deadened ? Here you have a country where night is night , and rain comes down and you know it . And you have a people with whom you must be on the qui vive all the time , all the time . And that is very good , no ? You do n't go sleepy . Like a pear ! Do n't you say a pear goes sleepy , no ? - cuando se echa a perder ? '
99250	99253	99254	99254	she	360	' Yes ! '
99257	99273	99158	99158	he	239	' And here you have also Ram n. How does Ram n seem to you ? '
99274	99311	99158	99158	he	239	' I do n't know . I do n't want to say anything . But I do think he is almost too much : too far . - And I do n't think he is Mexican . '
99312	99324	99158	99158	he	239	' Why not ? Why not Mexican ? He is Mexican . '
99325	99331	99158	99158	he	239	' Not as you are . '
99332	99343	99158	99158	he	239	' How not as I am ? He is Mexican . '
99344	99358	99359	99359	she	3796	' He seems to me to belong to the old , old Europe , '
99362	99383	99384	99384	he	3796	' And he seems to me to belong to the old , old Mexico - and also to the new , '
99388	99397	99158	99158	he	239	' But you do n't believe in him . '
99398	99401	99158	99158	he	239	' How ? '
99402	99453	99158	99158	he	239	' You - yourself . You do n't believe in him . You think it is like everything else , a sort of game . Everything is a sort of game , a put - up job , to you Mexicans . You do n't really believe , in anything . '
99454	99539	99158	99158	he	239	' How not believe ? I not believe in Ram n ? - Well , perhaps not , in that way of kneeling before him and spreading out my arms and shedding tears on his feet . But I - I believe in him , too . Not in your way , but in mine . I tell you why . Because he has the power to compel me . If he had n't the power to compel me , how should I believe ? '
99540	99552	99553	99553	she	3797	' It is a queer sort of belief that is compelled , '
99556	99641	99158	99158	he	239	' How else should one believe , except by being compelled ? I like Ram n for that , that he can compel me . When I grew up , and my godfather could not compel me to believe , I was very unhappy . It made me very unhappy . - But Ram n compels me , and that is very good . It makes me very happy , when I know I ca n't escape . It would make you happy too . '
99642	99654	99655	99655	she	3797	' To know I could not escape from Don Ram n ? '
99659	99684	99158	99158	he	239	' Yes , that also . And to know you could not escape from Mexico . And even from such a man as me . '
99696	99739	99685	99685	She	3797	' I do n't think it would make me happy to feel I could n't escape from Mexico . No , I feel , unless I was sure I could get out any day , I could n't bear to be here . '
99795	99798	99799	99799	he	3798	' Ah ! '
99803	100077	99799	99799	he	3798	' You think so . But then you do n't know . You can only think with American thoughts , it is natural . From your education , you have only American thoughts , U.S.A. thoughts , to think with . Nearly all women are like that : even Mexican women of the Spanish - Mexican class . They are all thinking nothing but U.S.A. thoughts , because those are the ones that go with the way they dress their hair . And so it is with you . You think like a modern woman , because you belong to the Anglo - Saxon or Teutonic world , and dress your hair in a certain way , and have money , and are altogether free . - But you only think like this because you have had these thoughts put in your head , just as in Mexico you spend centavos and pesos , because that is the Mexican money you have put in your pocket . It 's what they give you at the bank . - So when you say you are free , you are not free . You are compelled all the time to be thinking U.S.A. thoughts - compelled , I must say . You have not as much choice as a slave . As the peons must eat tortillas , tortillas , tortillas , because there is nothing else , you must think these U.S.A. thoughts , about being a woman and being free . Every day you must eat those tortillas , tortillas . - Till you do n't know how you would like something else . '
100078	100085	100086	100086	she	3800	' What else should I like ? '
100096	100160	100086	100086	she	3800	' Other thoughts , other feelings . - You are afraid of such a man as me , because you think I should not treat you l'américaine . You are quite right . I should not treat you as an American woman must be treated . Why should I ? I do n't wish to . It does n't seem good to me . '
100161	100185	100187	100187	Kate	360	' You would treat a woman like a real old Mexican , would you ? Keep her ignorant , and shut her up ? '
100190	100222	100086	100086	she	3800	' I could not keep her ignorant if she did not start ignorant . But what more I had to teach her would n't be in the American style of teaching . '
100223	100227	100086	100086	she	3800	' What then ? '
100228	100236	100086	100086	she	3800	' Quién sabe ! Ça reste voir . '
100237	100243	100245	100245	Kate	360	' Et continuera y rester , '

101002	101175	100993	100993	he	239	' you do not love , save with your will . I do n't like the love you have for your god : it is an assertion of your own will . I do n't like the love you have for me : it is the same . I do n't like the love you have for your children . If ever I see in them a spark of desire to be saved from it , I shall do my best to save them . Meanwhile have your love , have your will . But you know I dislike it . I dislike your insistence . I dislike your monopoly of one feeling , I dislike your charity works . I disapprove of the whole trend of your life . You are weakening and vitiating the boys . You do not love them , you are only putting your love will over them . One day they will turn and hate you for it . Remember I have said this to you . '
101316	101319	101320	101320	he	3824	' Carlota , '
101326	101352	101320	101320	he	3824	' how happy you would be if you could wear deep , deep mourning for me . - I shall not give you this happiness . '

101527	101536	101537	101537	she	360	' I am going with Cipriano after breakfast , '
101540	101547	101513	101513	she	360	' Yes , so you said . '
101548	101558	101513	101513	she	360	' The boys will be home in three weeks . '
101559	101562	101513	101513	she	360	' Yes . '
101563	101572	101513	101513	she	360	' Do n't you want to see them ? '
101573	101581	101513	101513	she	360	' If they want to see me . '
101582	101589	101513	101513	she	360	' I am sure they do . '
101590	101596	101513	101513	she	360	' Then bring them here . '
101597	101607	101608	101608	she	360	' Do you think it is pleasant for me ? '
101615	101627	101513	101513	she	360	' You do not make it pleasant for me , Carlota . '
101628	101698	101513	101513	she	360	' How can I ? You know I think you are wrong . When I listened to you last night - there is something so beautiful in it all - and yet so monstrous . So monstrous ! - Oh ! I think to myself : What is this man doing ? This man of all men , who might be such a blessing to his country and mankind - '
101699	101702	101704	101704	Ram	239	' Well , '
101706	101713	101704	101704	Ram	239	' And what is he instead ? '
101714	101745	101513	101513	she	360	' You know ! You know ! I ca n't bear it . - It is n't for you to save Mexico , Ram n. Christ has already saved it . '
101746	101754	101704	101704	Ram	239	' It seems to me not so . '
101755	101795	101513	101513	she	360	' He has ! He has ! And He made you the wonderful being that you are , so that you should work out the salvation , in the name of Christ and of love . Instead of which - '
101796	102027	101704	101704	Ram	239	' Instead of which , Carlota , I try something else . - But believe me , if the real Christ has not been able to save Mexico - and He has n't - then I am sure the white Anti - Christ of charity , and socialism , and politics , and reform , will only succeed in finally destroying her . That , and that alone , makes me take my stand . - You , Carlota , with your charity works and your pity : and men like Benito Juarez , with their Reform and their Liberty : and the rest of the benevolent people , politicians and socialists and so forth , surcharged with pity for living men , in their mouths , but really with hate - the hate of the materialist have - nots for the materialist haves : they are the Anti - Christ . The old world , that 's just the world . But the new world , that wants to save the People , this is the Anti - Christ . This is Christ with real poison in the communion cup . - And for this reason I step out of my ordinary privacy and individuality . I do n't want everybody poisoned . About the great mass I do n't care . But I do n't want everybody poisoned . '
102028	102052	101513	101513	she	360	' How can you be so sure that you yourself are not a poisoner of the people ? - I think you are . '
102053	102091	101704	101704	Ram	239	' Think it then . I think of you , Carlota , merely that you have not been able to come to your complete , final womanhood : which is a different thing from the old womanhoods . '
102092	102099	101513	101513	she	360	' Womanhood is always the same . '
102100	102113	101704	101704	Ram	239	' Ah , no , it is n't ! Neither is manhood . '
102114	102134	101513	101513	she	360	' But what do you think you can do ? What do you think this Quetzalcoatl nonsense amounts to ? '
102135	102283	101704	101704	Ram	239	' Quetzalcoatl is just a living word , for these people , no more . All I want them to do is to find the beginnings of the way to their own manhood , their own womanhood . Men are not yet men in full , and women are not yet women . They are all half and half , incoherent , part horrible , part pathetic , part good creatures . Half arrived . - I mean you as well , Carlota . I mean all the world . - But these people do n't assert any righteousness of their own , these Mexican people of ours . That makes me think that grace is still with them . And so , having got hold of some kind of clue to my own whole manhood , it is part of me now to try with them . '
102284	102289	101513	101513	she	360	' You will fail . '
102290	102322	101704	101704	Ram	239	' I sha n't . Whatever happens to me , there will be a new vibration , a new call in the air , and a new answer inside some men . '
102323	102355	101513	101513	she	360	' They will betray you . - Do you know what even your friend Toussaint said of you ? - Ram n Carrasco 's future is just the past of mankind . '
102356	102372	101704	101704	Ram	239	' A great deal of it is the past . Naturally Toussaint sees that part . '
102373	102441	101513	101513	she	360	' But the boys do n't believe in you . Instinctively , they disbelieve . Cyprian said to me , when I went to see him : " Is father doing any more of that silly talk about old gods coming back , mother ? I wish he would n't . It would be pretty nasty for us if he got himself into the newspapers with it . '
102447	102451	102452	102452	he	253	' Little boys , '
102455	102474	102452	102452	he	253	' are like little gramophones . They only talk according to the record that 's put into them . '
102475	102489	102491	102491	Carlota	360	' You do n't believe out of the mouths of babes and sucklings , '
102494	102563	102443	102443	Ram	253	' Why , Carlota , the babes and sucklings do n't get much chance . Their mothers and their teachers turn them into little gramophones from the first , so what can they do , but say and feel according to the record the mother and teacher puts into them ? Perhaps in the time of Christ babes and sucklings were not so perfectly exploited by their elders . '
102585	102589	102590	102590	he	3834	' Go away , '
102597	102612	102590	102590	he	3834	' Go away ! I have smelt the smell of your spirit long enough . '
102676	102685	102686	102686	he	3834	' What have I to do with it ! '
102870	102954	102955	102955	Kate	360	' Ah , Niña , how good ! How good that you have come ! Ay , in the night , how much water ! Much ! Much ! But you were safe in the hacienda , Niña . Ah , how nice , that hacienda of Jamiltepec . Such a good man , Don Ram n - is n't he , Niña ? He cares a great deal for his people . And the Señora , ah , how sympathetic she is ! '

108023	108030	108032	108032	Juana	334	' Entonces ! - Read then , '
108034	108039	108046	108046	her	336	' He is afraid , '
108055	108069	108046	108046	her	336	' However , read , Julio ! Because the Niña wants to hear . '
108084	108092	108077	108077	Julio	297	' Do I begin from the beginning . '
108093	108102	108104	108104	Juana	334	' Yes , from the beginning ! Read ! '
108160	108176	108150	108150	He	7334	' I am Quetzalcoatl with the dark face , who lived in Mexico in other days .
108177	108276	108150	108150	He	7334	' Till there came a stranger from over the seas , and his face was white , and he spoke with strange words . He showed his hands and his feet , that in both there were holes . And he said : " My name is Jesus , and they called me Christ . Men crucified me on a Cross till I died . But I rose up out of the place where they put me , and I went up to heaven to my Father . Now my Father has told me to come to Mexico . "
108277	108283	108150	108150	He	7334	' Quetzalcoatl said : You alone ?
108284	108358	108150	108150	He	7334	' Jesus said : My mother is here . She shed many tears for me , seeing me crucify . So she will hold the Sons of Mexico on her lap , and soothe them when they suffer , and when the women of Mexico weep , she will take them on her bosom and comfort them . And when she cries to the Father for her people , He will make everything well .
108359	108380	108150	108150	He	7334	' Quetzatlcoatl said : That is well . And Brother with the name Jesus , what will you do in Mexico ?
108381	108425	108150	108150	He	7334	' Jesus said : I will bring peace into Mexico . And on the naked I will put clothes , and food between the lips of the hungry , and gifts in all men 's hands , and peace and love in their hearts .
108426	108477	108150	108150	He	7334	' Quetzalcoatl said : It is very good . I am old . I could not do so much . I must go now . Farewell , people of Mexico . Farewell , strange brother called Jesus . Farewell , woman called Mary . It is time for me to go .
108478	108632	108150	108150	He	7334	' So Quetzalcoatl looked at his people ; and he embraced Jesus , the Son of Heaven ; and he embraced Maria , the Blessed Virgin , the Holy Mother of Jesus , and he turned away . Slowly he went . But in his ears was the sound of the tearing down of his temples in Mexico . Nevertheless he went on slowly , being old , and weary with much living . He climbed the steep of the mountain , and over the white snow of the volcano . As he went , behind him rose a cry of people dying , and a flame of places burning . He said to himself : Surely those are Mexicans crying ! Yet I must not hear , for Jesus has come to the land , and he will wipe the tears from all eyes , and his Mother will make them all glad .
108633	108683	108150	108150	He	7334	' He also said : Surely that is Mexico burning . But I must not look , for all men will be brothers , now Jesus has come to the land , and the women will sit by the blue skirts of Mary , smiling with peace and with love .
108684	108740	108150	108150	He	7334	' So the old god reached the top of the mountain , and looked up into the blue of heaven . And through a door in the blue wall he saw a great darkness , and stars and a moon shining . And beyond the darkness he saw one great star , like a bright gateway .
108741	108823	108150	108150	He	7334	' Then fire rose from the volcano around the old Quetzalcoatl , in wings and glittering feathers . And with the wings of fire and the glitter of sparks Quetzalcoatl flew up , up , like a wafting fire , like a glittering bird , up , into the space , and away to the white steps of heaven , that lead to the blue walls , where is the door to the dark . So he entered in and was gone .
108824	108854	108150	108150	He	7334	' Night fell , and Quetzalcoatl was gone , and men in the world saw only a star travelling back into heaven , departing under the low branches of darkness .
108855	108885	108150	108150	He	7334	' Then men in Mexico said : Quetzalcoatl has gone . Even his star has departed . We must listen to this Jesus , who speaks in a foreign tongue .
108886	108912	108150	108150	He	7334	' So they learned a new speech from the priests that came from upon the great waters to the east . And they became Christians . '
108932	108937	108939	108939	Kate	360	' It is beautiful , '
108941	108947	108949	108951	the sceptical Juana	4025	' And it is true ! '
108953	108960	108962	108962	Kate	360	' It seems to me true , '
108964	108967	108969	108969	Concha	337	' Señora ! '
108971	109034	108969	108969	Concha	337	' Is it true that heaven is up there , and you come down steps like clouds to the edge of the sky , like the steps from the mole into the lake ? Is it true that El Señor comes and stands on the steps and looks down at us like we look down into the lake to see the charales ? '
109059	109066	109068	109068	Kate	360	' I do n't know everything , '
109070	109078	109068	109068	Kate	360	' But it seems to me true . '
109079	109084	109086	109086	Concha	337	' She believes it , '
109095	109101	109103	109103	Juana	334	' And is it true , '
109105	109132	109103	109103	Juana	334	' that El Señor , El Cristo del Mundo , is a gringo , and that He comes from your country , with His Holy Mother ? '
109133	109145	109092	109093	her mother	1333	' Not from my country , but from a country near . '
109146	109149	109151	109151	Juana	334	' Listen ! '
109155	109193	109151	109151	Juana	334	' El Señor is a gringuito , and His Holy Mother is a gringuita . Yes , one really knows . Look ! Look at the feet of the Niña ! Pure feet the Santísima ! Look ! '
109220	109248	109208	109208	Juana	334	' Feet of the Santísima . And She , the Holy Mary , is a gringuita . She came over the sea , like you , Niña ? '
109249	109258	109092	109093	her mother	1333	' Yes , she came over the sea ! '
109259	109266	109208	109208	Juana	334	' Ah ! You know it ? '
109267	109274	109092	109093	her mother	1333	' Yes . We know that . '
109275	109303	109304	109304	Juana	334	' Think of it ! The Santísima is a gringuita , and She came over the Sea like the Niña , from the countries of the Niña ! '
109317	109328	109330	109330	Concha	337	' And the Lord is a Gringuito - pure Gringuito ? '
109332	109363	109304	109304	Juana	334	' And Niña - it was the gringos who killed El Señor ? It was n't the Mexicans ? It was those other gringos who put Him on the Cross ? '
109364	109367	109369	109369	Kate	360	' Yes ! '
109371	109378	109369	109369	Kate	360	' It was n't the Mexicans . '
109379	109383	109304	109304	Juana	334	' The gringos ? '
109384	109390	109369	109369	Kate	360	' Yes , the gringos . '
109391	109399	109304	109304	Juana	334	' And He Himself was a Gringo ? '
109400	109403	109405	109405	Kate	360	' Yes ! '
109414	109417	109419	109419	Juana	334	' Look ! '
109430	109445	109422	109422	her	334	' He was a Gringo , and the gringos put him on the Cross . '
109446	109453	109455	109455	Kate	360	' But a long time ago , '
109458	109468	109470	109470	Juana	334	' A long time ago , says the Niña , '
109526	109532	109540	109542	Maria del Carmen	336	' And now , Niña , '
109544	109564	109540	109542	Maria del Carmen	336	' El Señor is going back again to His Father , and our Quetzalcoatl is coming back to us ? '
109565	109573	109580	109580	Juana	334	' And the Santísima is leaving us ? '
109582	109606	109580	109580	Juana	334	' Think of it ! The Santísima is leaving us , and this Quetzalcoatl is coming ! He has no mother , he ! '
109607	109614	109616	109616	Kate	360	' Perhaps he has a wife , '
109618	109622	109624	109624	Juana	334	' Quién sabe ! '
109626	109630	109632	109634	the bold Concha	337	' They say , '
109636	109645	109632	109634	the bold Concha	337	' that in Paradise he has grown young . '
109646	109649	109651	109651	Juana	334	' Who ? '
109653	109663	109665	109665	Concha	337	' I do n't know how they call him , '
109673	109676	109681	109681	his	349	' Quetzalcoatl ! '
109687	109708	109681	109681	his	349	' Yes , he is young . He is a god in the flower of life , and finely built . '
109709	109718	109720	109720	Juana	334	' They say so ! They say so ! '
109722	109727	109720	109720	Juana	334	' Think of it ! '
109728	109734	109736	109736	Ezequiel	349	' Here it says so ! '
109738	109749	109736	109736	Ezequiel	349	' Here it is written . In the second Hymn . '
109750	109757	109681	109681	his	349	' Read it then , Julio . '
109771	109784	109681	109681	his	349	' I , Quetzalcoatl , of Mexico , I travelled the longest journey .
109785	109836	109681	109681	his	349	' Beyond the blue outer wall of heaven , beyond the bright place of the Sun , across the plains of darkness where the stars spread out like trees , like trees and bushes , far away to the heart of all the worlds , low down like the Morning Star .
109837	109886	109681	109681	his	349	' And at the heart of all the worlds those were waiting whose faces I could not see . And in voices like bees they murmured among themselves : This is Quetzalcoatl whose hair is white with fanning the fires of life . He comes alone , and slowly .
109887	109915	109681	109681	his	349	' Then with hands I could not see , they took my hands , and in their arms that I could not see , at last I died .
109916	109980	109681	109681	his	349	' But when I was dead , and bone , they cast not my bones away , they did not give me up to the four winds , nor to the six . No , not even to the wind that blows down to the middle of earth , nor to him that blows upward like a finger pointing , did they give me .
109981	109991	109681	109681	his	349	' He is dead , they said , but unrelinquished .
109992	110076	109681	109681	his	349	' So they took the oil of the darkness , and laid it on my brow and my eyes , they put it in my ears and nostrils and my mouth , they put it on the two - fold silence of my breasts , and on my sunken navel , and on my secret places , before and behind : and in the palms of my hands , and on the mounds of my knees , and under the tread of my feet .
110077	110107	109681	109681	his	349	' Lastly , they anointed all my head with the oil that comes out of the darkness . They they said : He is sealed up . Lay him away .
110108	110143	109681	109681	his	349	' So they laid me in the fountain that bubbles darkly at the heart of the worlds , far , far behind the sun , and there lay I , Quetzalcoatl , in warm oblivion .
110144	110154	109681	109681	his	349	' I slept the great sleep , and dreamed not .
110155	110163	109681	109681	his	349	' Till a voice was calling : Quetzalcoatl !
110164	110171	109681	109681	his	349	' I said : Who is that ?
110172	110183	109681	109681	his	349	' No one answered , but the voice said : Quetzalcoatl !
110184	110191	109681	109681	his	349	' I said : Where art thou ?
110192	110211	109681	109681	his	349	' So ! he said . I am neither here nor there . I am thyself . Get up .
110212	110228	109681	109681	his	349	' Now all was very heavy upon me , like a tomb - stone of darkness .
110229	110245	109681	109681	his	349	' I said : Am I not old ? How shall I roll this stone away ?
110246	110267	109681	109681	his	349	' How art thou old , when I am new man ? I will roll away the stone . Sit up !
110268	110285	109681	109681	his	349	' I sat up , and the stone went rolling , crashing down the gulfs of space .
110286	110406	109681	109681	his	349	' I said to myself : I am new man . I am younger than the young and older than the old . Lo ! I am unfolded on the stem of time like a flower , I am at the midst of the flower of my manhood . Neither do I ache with desire , to tear , to burst the bud ; neither do I yearn away like a seed that floats into heaven . The cup of my flowering is unfolded , in its middle the stars float balanced with array . My stem is in the air , my roots are in all the dark , the sun is no more than a cupful within me .
110407	110426	110506	110506	My	0	' Lo ! I am neither young nor old , I am the flower unfolded , I am new .
110427	110479	109681	109681	his	349	' So I rose and stretched my limbs and looked around . The sun was below me in a daze of heat , like a hot humming - bird hovering at mid - day over the worlds . And his beak was long and very sharp , he was like a dragon .
110480	110492	110506	110506	My	0	' And a faint star was hesitating wearily , waiting to pass .
110493	110505	109681	109681	his	349	' I called aloud , saying : " Who is that ? "
110553	110605	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' I caught the sun and held him , and in my shade the faint star slipped past , going slowly into the dark reaches beyond the burning of the sun . Then on the slope of silence he sat down and took off his sandals , and I put them on .
110606	110623	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' " How do they wear the wings of love , Jesus , the Mexican people ? "
110624	110648	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' " The souls of the Mexican people are heavy for the wings of love , they have swallowed the stone of despair . "
110649	110669	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' " Where is your Lady Mother in the mantle of blue , she with comfort in her lap ? "
110670	110770	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' " Her mantle faded in the dust of the world , she was weary without sleep , for the voices of people cried night and day , and the knives of the Mexican people were sharper than the pinions of love , and their stubbornness was stronger than hope . Lo ! the fountain of tears dries up in the eyes of the old , and the lap of the aged is comfortless , they look for rest . Quetzalcoatl , Sir , my mother went even before me , to her still white bed in the moon . "
110771	110792	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' " She is gone , and thou art gone , Jesus , the Crucified . Then what of Mexico ? "
110793	110905	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' " The images stand in their churches , Oh Quetzalcoatl , they do n't know that I and my Mother have departed . They are angry souls , Brother , my Lord ! They vent their anger . They broke my Churches , they stole my strength , they withered the lips of the Virgin . They drove us away , and we crept away like a tottering old man and a woman , tearless and bent double with age . So we fled while they were not looking . And we seek but rest , to forget forever the children of men who have swallowed the stone of despair . "
110906	110942	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' Then said I : It is good , pass on . I , Quetzalcoatl , will go down . Sleep thou the sleep without dreams . Farewell at the cross - roads , Brother Jesus .
110943	110973	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' He said : Oh , Quetzalcoatl ! They have forgotten thee . The feathered snake ! The serpent - silent bird ! They are asking for none of thee .
110974	111105	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' I said : Go thy way , for the dust of earth is in thy eyes and on thy lips . For me the serpent of middle - earth sleeps in my loins and my belly , the bird of the outer air perches on my brow and sweeps her bill across my breast . But I , I am lord of two ways . I am master of up and down . I am as a man who is a new man , with new limbs and life , and the light of the Morning Star in his eyes . Lo ! I am I ! The lord of both ways . Thou wert lord of the one way . Now it leads thee to the sleep . Farewell !
111106	111136	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' So Jesus went on towards the sleep . And Mary the Mother of Sorrows lay down on the bed of the white moon , weary beyond any more tears .
111137	111170	110522	110523	My mother	2565	' And I , I am on the threshold . I am stepping across the border . I am Quetzalcoatl , lord of both ways , star between day and the dark . '
111476	111484	111499	111499	his	4049	' Do you want charcoal , Niña ? '
111502	111507	111499	111499	his	4049	' At how much ? '
111508	111517	111499	111499	his	4049	' Twenty - five reales the two sacks . '
111518	111524	111499	111499	his	4049	' I pay twenty reales . '
111525	111543	111499	111499	his	4049	' At twenty reales then , Señorita . But you give me two reales for the transport ? '
111544	111551	111553	111553	Kate	360	' The owner pays the transport , '
111555	111564	111553	111553	Kate	360	' But I will give you twenty centavos . '
112938	112948	112920	112920	Juana	334	' Look ! Niña ! It is the General ! '
112962	112966	112967	112967	she	360	' Don Cipriano ! '
112970	112974	112975	112975	he	4120	' The same ! '
112978	112986	112975	112975	he	4120	' Did that drunken fellow frighten you ? '
112987	113005	112956	112957	The officer	4120	' Not much ! Only startled me . I did n't feel any evil intention behind it . '
113006	113012	112975	112975	he	4120	' No , only drunk . '
113013	113021	112956	112957	The officer	4120	' But I shall go home now . '
113022	113029	112975	112975	he	4120	' Shall I walk with you ? '
113030	113036	112956	112957	The officer	4120	' Would you care to ? '
113126	113133	113135	113135	Kate	360	' But the night is beautiful , '
113140	113150	113151	113151	he	4120	' With the moon clipped away just a little , '
113171	113178	113179	113179	she	334	' Do the soldiers escort you ? '
113182	113187	113189	113189	he	4120	' I suppose so , '
113191	113196	113197	113197	she	334	' But the moon , '
113200	113214	113197	113197	she	334	' is n't lovely and friendly as it is in England or Italy . '
113215	113222	113223	113223	he	4120	' It is the same planet , '
113226	113259	113268	113268	he	4120	' But the moonshine in America is n't the same . It does n't make one feel glad as it does in Europe . One feels it would like to hurt one . '

113296	113310	113268	113268	he	4120	' European good faith . Perhaps it is not the same as Mexican . '
113318	113327	113328	113328	she	360	' Fancy your Mexican moon objecting to me ! '
113332	113341	113343	113343	he	4120	' Fancy your objecting to our Mexican moon ! '
113345	113350	113352	113352	she	360	' I was n't , '
113498	113503	113505	113505	Kate	360	' But how absurd ! '
113507	113516	113505	113505	Kate	360	' Cocks do n't crow at this hour . '

113533	113544	113545	113545	he	4120	' He thinks your moon is the sun , no ? '
113560	113572	113574	113574	Cipriano	239	' This is very nice , your house , your patio , '
113581	113589	113590	113590	he	4120	' Or do n't you like it ? '
113593	113597	113598	113598	she	360	' You see , '
113601	113665	113598	113598	she	360	' I have nothing to do ! The servants wo n't let me do anything . If I sweep my room , they stand and say Qué Niña ! Qué Niña ! As if I was standing on my head for their benefit . I sew , though I 've no interest in sewing . - What is it , for a life ? '
113666	113671	113672	113672	he	4120	' And you read ! '
113682	113700	113701	113701	she	360	' Ah , it is all such stupid , lifeless stuff , in the books and papers , '
113714	113816	113711	113711	he	4120	' But what would you like to do ? As you say , you take no interest in sewing . You know the Navajo women , when they weave a blanket , leave a little place for their soul to come out , at the end : not to weave their soul into it . - I always think England has woven her soul into her fabrics , into all the things she has made . And she never left a place for it to come out . So now all her soul is in her goods , and nowhere else . '
113817	113824	113826	113826	Kate	360	' But Mexico has no soul , '
113828	113842	113826	113826	Kate	360	' She 's swallowed the stone of despair , as the hymn says . '
113843	113939	113711	113711	he	4120	' Ah ! You think so ? I think not . The soul is also a thing you make , like a pattern in a blanket . It is very nice while all the wools are rolling their different threads and different colours , and the pattern is being made . But once it is finished - then finished it has no interest any more . Mexico has n't started to weave the pattern of her soul . Or she is only just starting : with Ram n. Do n't you believe in Ram n ? '
113946	113971	113972	113972	she	360	' Ram n , yes ! I do ! But whether it 's any good trying here in Mexico , as he is trying - '
113976	113991	113711	113711	he	4120	' He is in Mexico . He tries here . Why should not you ? '

113996	114032	113711	113711	he	4120	' Yes ! You ! Ram n does n't believe in womanless gods , he says . Why should you not be the woman in the Quetzalcoatl pantheon ? If you will , the goddess ! '

114162	114176	114177	114177	she	360	' But I do n't feel like a goddess in a Mexican pantheon , '

114220	114275	114177	114177	she	360	' You marry me . You complain you have nothing to do . Then marry me . Marry me , and help Ram n and me . We need a woman , Ram n says , to be with us . And you are the woman . There is a great deal to do . '
114276	114286	114288	114288	Kate	360	' But ca n't I help without marrying anybody ? '

114331	114334	114335	114335	he	4145	' Why ? '
114338	114388	114389	114389	He	4145	' You see , Mexico is really a bit horrible to me . And the black eyes of the people really make my heart contract , and my flesh shrink . There 's a bit of horror in it . And I do n't want horror in my soul . '
114415	114419	114420	114420	he	4145	' Why not ? '
114425	114446	114420	114420	he	4145	' Horror is real . Why not a bit of horror , as you say , among all the rest ? '

114471	114515	114447	114447	He	4145	' You feel a bit of horror for me too . - But why not ? Perhaps I feel a bit of horror for you too , for your light - coloured eyes and your strong white hands . But that is good . '
114542	114548	114549	114549	he	4145	' Get used to it , '
114552	114618	114549	114549	he	4145	' Get used to it that there must be a bit of fear , and a bit of horror in your life . And marry me , and you will find many things that are not horror . The bit of horror is like the sesame seed in the nougat , it gives the sharp wild flavour . It is good to have it there . '
114785	114791	114792	114792	she	360	' I ca n't believe , '
114795	114802	114792	114792	she	360	' that I could do it . '
114803	114807	114808	114808	he	4145	' Do it , '
114811	114818	114808	114808	he	4145	' And then you will know . '
114960	114963	114964	114964	he	4145	' Well ! '

115193	115205	115206	115206	she	360	' No . But Don Ram n is n't really Mexican , '
115209	115214	115117	115117	Kate	360	' Not really Mexican ? '
115215	115223	115235	115235	She	360	' No ! - He feels European . '
115224	115234	115117	115117	Kate	360	' Really ! To me he is - Mexico . '
115242	115272	115235	115235	She	360	' I will row in a boat to Jamiltepec to - morrow , or I will take Alonso 's motor - boat . I will come about ten o'clock . '

117217	117296	117297	117297	I	0	'm laughing at them . The first thing I did when I saw them , was to laugh at the sight of such fools . Such lumps , such frogs with stones in their bellies . Tell them they are like frogs with stones in their bellies , ca n't hop ! Tell them they must get the stones out of their bellies , Get rid of their heaviness , Their lumpishness , Or I 'll smother them all .

Unless I can stand uncontaminated , I had better abandon everything . But the Church will push me over to the socialists - and the socialists will betray me on the first opportunity . It is not myself . It is the new spirit . The surest way to kill it - and it can be killed , like any other living thing - is to get it connected with any political party . '
119482	119491	119493	119493	Cipriano	239	' Why do n't you see the Bishop ? '
119495	119516	119493	119493	Cipriano	239	' I will see him too . Am I to be chief of the division in the west for nothing ? '

119526	119619	119522	119523	Ram n	371	' I will see Jimenez . I have thought of it . Yes , I intend to use every means in my power . - Montes will stand for us , because he hates the Church and hates any hint of dictation from outside . He sees the possibility of a " national " church . Though myself , I do n't care about national churches . Only one has to speak the language of one 's own people . You know the priests are forbidding the people to read the Hymns ? '
119620	119626	119628	119628	Cipriano	239	' What does that matter ? '
119630	119649	119628	119628	Cipriano	239	' These people are nothing if not perverse , nowadays . They will read them all the more . '

119699	119703	119705	119705	Cipriano	239	' Ram n ! '
119707	119722	119705	119705	Cipriano	239	' If you can turn Mexico entirely into a Quetzalcoatl country , what then ? '
119723	119737	119522	119523	Ram n	371	' I shall be First Man of Quetzalcoatl - I know no more . '
119738	119750	119705	119705	Cipriano	239	' You wo n't trouble about the rest of the world ? '
119769	119774	119775	119775	he	371	' I would like , '
119780	120509	119775	119775	he	371	' to be one of the Initiates of the Earth . One of the Initiators . Every country its own Saviour , Cipriano : or every people its own Saviour . And the First Men of every people , forming a Natural Aristocracy of the World . One must have aristocrats , that we know . But natural ones , not artificial . And in some way the world must be organically united : the world of man . But in the concrete , not in the abstract . Leagues and Covenants and International Programmes . Ah ! Cipriano ! it 's like an international pestilence . The leaves of one great tree ca n't hang on the boughs of another great tree . The races of the earth are like trees ; in the end they neither mix nor mingle . They stand out of each other 's way , like trees . Or else they crowd on one another , and their roots grapple , and it is the fight to the death . - Only from the flowers there is commingling . And the flowers of every race are the natural aristocrats of that race . And the spirit of the world can fly from flower to flower , like a humming - bird , and slowly fertilize the great trees in their blossoms . Only the Natural Aristocrats can rise above their nation ; and even then they do not rise beyond their race . Only the Natural Aristocrats of the World can be international , or cosmopolitan , or cosmic . It has always been so . The peoples are no more capable of it than the leaves of the mango - tree are capable of attaching themselves to the pine . - So if I want Mexicans to learn the name of Quetzalcoatl , it is because I want them to speak with the tongues of their own blood . I wish the Teutonic world would once more think in terms of Thor and Wotan , and the tree Igdrasil . And I wish the Druidic world would see , honestly , that in the mistletoe is their mystery , and that they themselves are the Tuatha De Danaan , alive , but submerged . And a new Hermes should come back to the Mediterranean , and a new Ashtaroth to Tunis ; and Mithras again to Persia , and Brahma unbroken to India , and the oldest of dragons to China . Then I , Cipriano , I , First Man of Quetzalcoatl , with you , First Man of Huitzilopochtli , and perhaps your wife , First Woman of Itzpapalotl , could we not meet , with sure souls , the other great aristocrats of the world , the First Man of Wotan and the First Woman of Freya , First Lord of Hermes , and the Lady of Astarte , the Best - Born of Brahma , and the Son of the Greatest Dragon ? I tell you , Cipriano , then the earth might rejoice , when the First Lords of the West met the First Lords of South and East , in the Valley of the Soul . Ah , the earth has Valleys of the Soul , that are not cities of commerce and industry . And the mystery is one mystery , but men must see it differently . The hibiscus and the thistle and the gentian all flower on the Tree of Life , but in the world they are far apart ; and must be . And I am hibiscus and you are a yucca flower , and your Caterina is a wild daffodil , and my Carlota is a white pansy . Only four of us , yet we make a curious bunch . So it is . The men and women of the earth are not manufactured goods , to be interchangeable . But the Tree of Life is one tree , as we know when our souls open in the last blossoming . We ca n't change ourselves , and we do n't want to . But when our souls open out in the final blossoming , then as blossoms we share one mystery with all blossoms , beyond the knowledge of any leaves and stems and roots : something transcendent .

And I suppose they all said nice things to me , as they do . I only answered : You are all monkeys ! It was a great success ! - But I felt it even as a child , and I feel it now .

121169	121173	121174	121174	he	4348	' Puros monos ! '
121181	121190	121174	121174	he	4348	' Y lo que hacen , puras monerías . '
121191	121204	121206	121206	he	4348	' Pure monkeys ! And the things they do , sheer monkeydom ! '
121209	121215	121206	121206	he	4348	' Yet you have children ! '
121216	121221	121222	121222	she	4349	' Yes ! Yes ! '
121229	121236	121222	121222	she	4349	' My first husband 's children . '
121237	121247	121206	121206	he	4348	' And they ? - monos y no más ? '
121248	121251	121252	121252	she	4349	' No ! '
121262	121266	121252	121252	she	4349	' Only partly . '
121267	121272	121273	121273	he	4348	' It is bad , '
121280	121284	121285	121285	he	4348	' But then ! '
121289	121429	121285	121285	he	4348	' What are my own children to me , but little monkeys ? And their mother - and their mother - Ah , no ! Señora Caterina ! It is no good . One must be able to disentangle oneself from persons , from people . If I go to a rose - bush , to be intimate with it , it is a nasty thing that hurts me . One must disentangle oneself from persons and personalities , and see people as one sees the trees in the landscape . People in some way dominate you . In some way , humanity dominates your consciousness . So you must hate people and humanity , and you want to escape . But there is only one way of escape : to turn beyond them , to the greater life . '
121430	121435	121437	121437	Kate	360	' But I do ! '
121439	121489	121437	121437	Kate	360	' I do nothing else . When I was with Joachim absolutely alone in a cottage , doing all the work myself , and knowing nobody at all , just living , and feeling the greater thing all the time ; then I was free , I was happy . '
121490	121494	121496	121496	Ram	239	' But he ? '
121498	121505	121437	121437	Kate	360	' Was he free and happy ? '
121506	121543	121437	121437	Kate	360	' He was really . But that 's where the monkeyishness comes in . He would n't let himself be content . He insisted on having people and a cause , just to torture himself with . '
121544	121561	121562	121562	he	239	' Then why did n't you live in your cottage quite alone , and without him ? '
121565	121574	121562	121562	he	239	' Why do you travel and see people ? '
123251	123257	123258	123258	he	239	' We are coming up ! '
123268	123291	123258	123258	he	239	' Shall we go upstairs ? Will you drink something cool , tepache , or squeezed oranges ? There is no ice . '
123292	123301	123302	123302	she	360	' I would like orange juice and water , '
123345	123360	123361	123361	he	239	' I heard you come . I thought perhaps you had gone away again , '
123395	123399	123400	123400	she	360	' Not yet , '
123414	123438	123439	123439	he	239	' The Señora Caterina thinks we are all monkeys , but perhaps this particular monkey - show is the most amusing after all , '
123442	123453	123439	123439	he	239	' So she will see a little more of it . '
123479	123490	123492	123492	Kate	360	' That 's rather an unfair way of putting it ! '
123549	123552	123553	123553	she	360	' No ! '
123556	123564	123553	123553	she	360	' There 's something else beside that . '
123565	123568	123570	123570	Ram	239	' Ah ! '
123572	123584	123553	123553	she	360	' Take care ! A little mercy is a dangerous thing . '
123585	123591	123592	123592	she	360	' No ! Not mercy ! '
123597	123606	123592	123592	she	360	' Why are you being horrid to me ? '
123607	123618	123620	123621	Ram n.	239	' Monkeys always end by being horrid to the spectators , '
123638	123642	123643	123643	she	360	' I came , '
123646	123665	123643	123643	she	360	' to hear about the Mexican pantheon . I was even given to understand I might be admitted . '
123666	123673	123675	123675	Ram	239	' Ah , that is good ! '
123677	123720	123643	123643	she	360	' A rare specimen of the female monkey has been added to the Ram n menagerie ! I am sure you would be a good draw . There have been some pretty goddesses , I assure you , in the Aztec pantheon . '
123721	123725	123726	123726	she	360	' How horrid ! '
123729	123734	123735	123735	he	239	' Come ! Come ! '
123738	123882	123735	123735	he	239	' Let us keep to the bedrock of things , Señora mía . We are all monkeys . Monos somos . - Ihr seid alle Affen ! Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings was it spoken , as Carlota said . You see that little male monkey , Cipriano . He had the monkey 's idea of marrying you . Say the word . Marriage is a monkey 's game . Say the word . He will let you go when you 've had enough ; and he 's had enough . He is a general and a very great jefe . He can make you monkey - queen of monkey - Mexico , if it please you . And what should monkeys do , but amuse themselves ! Vamos ! Embobémonos ! Shall I be priest ? Vamos ! Vamos ! '
123906	123915	123916	123916	he	4422	' What have you been saying to him ? '
123919	123922	123923	123923	she	360	' Nothing ! '
123928	123935	123923	123923	she	360	' I 'd better go now . '
123990	123999	124000	124000	Juana	334	' Mucho calor , Niña ! Mucho calor ! '
126119	126138	126109	126109	He	4561	' I have finished this reading of the Fourth Hymn of Quetzalcoatl . Now I will begin again . '
126976	127010	127012	127012	he	4625	' Ah , Don Ram n , it is long since I saw you ! How goes it , eh ? Well , well ? That is good ! That is very good ! '
127025	127066	127012	127012	he	4625	' Ah , my General , much honour , much honour ! Welcome to this poor house of yours . It is the house of your Honour ! To serve you ! Gentlemen ! Wo n't you take a seat ? '
127107	127112	127113	127113	he	7862	' Good ! Señores ! '
127124	127137	127113	127113	he	7862	' At your service ! Entirely at the service of your Honours . '
127138	127153	127155	127155	Ram	239	' Doña Carlota is in the city , Father . You have seen her ? '
127157	127164	127166	127167	the Bishop	7862	' Yes , son of mine , '
127169	127184	127113	127113	he	7862	' Then you know the latest news about me . She told you everything . '
127185	127224	127113	127113	he	7862	' Somewhat ! Somewhat ! She spoke somewhat of you , the poor little thing . Thanks to God she has her sons with her . They are safely back in their native country , in good health . '
127225	127231	127113	127113	he	7862	' Did you see them ? '
127232	127282	127113	127113	he	7862	' Yes ! yes ! Two of my dearest children ! Very sympathetic , very intelligent , like their father ; and , like him , promising to be of very handsome presence . Yes ! yes ! Smoke if you will , my General . Do n't hesitate . '
127299	127312	127314	127314	Ram	239	' You know all about what I want to do , Father ? '
127316	127342	127343	127343	he	239	' I do n't know all , son of mine , but I know enough . I would n't want to hear more . Eh ! '
127346	127352	127343	127343	he	239	' It is very sad . '
127353	127443	127113	127113	he	7862	' Not so very sad , Father , if we do n't make it sad . Why make a sad thing out of it , Father ? We are in Mexico for the most part Indians . They can not understand the high Christianity , Father , and the Church knows it . Christianity is a religion of the spirit , and must needs be understood if it is to have any effect . The Indians can not understand it , any more than the rabbits of the hills . '
127444	127475	127343	127343	he	239	' Very good ! Very good ! Son of mine ! But we can convey it to them . The rabbits of the hills are in the hands of God . '
127476	127516	127113	127113	he	7862	' No , Father , it is impossible . And without a religion that will connect them with the universe , they will all perish . Only religion will serve ; not socialism , nor education , nor anything . '
127517	127522	127524	127525	the Bishop	7862	' Thou speakest well , '
127527	127589	127113	127113	he	7862	' The rabbits of the hills may be in the hands of God , Father . But they are at the mercy of men . The same with Mexico . The people sink heavier and heavier into inertia , and the Church can not help them , because the Church does not possess the key - word to the Mexican soul . '
127590	127602	127604	127605	the Bishop	7862	' Does n't the Mexican soul know the Voice of God ? '
127607	127651	127113	127113	he	7862	' Your own children may know your voice , Father . But if you go out to speak to the birds on the lake , or the deer among the mountains , will they know your voice ? Will they wait and listen ? '
127652	127670	127113	127113	he	7862	' Who knows ? It is said they waited to listen to the Holy Francisco of Assisi . '
127671	127719	127113	127113	he	7862	' Now , Father , we must speak to the Mexicans in their own language , and give them the clue - word to their own souls . I shall say Quetzalcoatl . If I am wrong , let me perish . But I am not wrong . '
127748	127758	127113	127113	he	7862	' Your Church is the Catholic Church , Father ? '
127759	127762	127764	127765	the Bishop	7862	' Surely ! '
127767	127781	127113	127113	he	7862	' And Catholic Church means the Church of All , the Universal Church ? '
127782	127789	127113	127113	he	7862	' Surely , son of mine . '
127790	127842	127113	127113	he	7862	' Then why not let it be really catholic ? Why call it catholic , when it is not only just one among many Churches , but is even hostile to all the rest of the churches ? Father , why not let the Catholic Church become really the Universal Church ? '
127843	127855	127113	127113	he	7862	' It is the Universal Church of Christ , my son . '
127856	127927	127113	127113	he	7862	' Why not let it be the Universal Church of Mohammed as well ; since ultimately , God is One God , but the peoples speak varying languages , and each needs its own prophet to speak with its own tongue . The Universal Church of Christ , and Mohammed , and Buddha , and Quetzalcoatl , and all the others - that would be a Catholic Church , Father . '
127928	127936	127938	127939	the Bishop	7862	' You speak of things beyond me , '
127945	127951	127953	127954	Don Ram	239	' Not beyond any man , '
127956	128010	127113	127113	he	7862	' A Catholic Church is a church of all the religions , a home on earth for all the prophets and the Christs , a big tree under which every man who acknowledges the greater life of the soul can sit and be refreshed . Is n't that the Catholic Church , Father ? '
128011	128048	127113	127113	he	7862	' Alas , my son , I know the Apostolic Church of Christ in Rome , of which I am a humble servant . I do not understand these clever things you are saying to me . '
128049	128128	127113	127113	he	7862	' I am asking you for peace , Father . I am not one who hates the Church of Christ , the Roman Catholic Church . But in Mexico I think it has no place . When my heart is not bitter , I am grateful forever to Christ , the Son of God . The affair of the Judases grieves me more than it does you , and the affairs of bloodshed are far bitterer to me . '
128129	128142	127113	127113	he	7862	' I am no innovator , my son , to provoke bloodshed . '
128143	128186	127113	127113	he	7862	' Listen ! I am going to remove the holy images from the church at Sayula , with reverence , and with reverence burn them upon the lake . Then I shall put the image of Quetzalcoatl in the church at Sayula . '
128208	128219	128220	128220	he	7862	' Would you dare do that , Don Ram n ? '
128223	128239	127113	127113	he	7862	' Yes ! And I shall not be prevented . General Viedma is with me . '
128247	128250	128252	128252	Cipriano	239	' Certainly , '
128254	128260	128262	128263	the Bishop	7862	' Nevertheless it is illegal , '
128269	128276	128278	128278	Ram	239	' What is illegal in Mexico ? '
128280	128296	128278	128278	Ram	239	' What is weak is illegal . I will not be weak , My Lord . '
128297	128301	128303	128304	the Bishop	7862	' Lucky you ! '
128317	128320	128322	128322	Ram	239	' No ! '
128324	128438	128322	128322	Ram	239	' I come to ask you for peace . Tell the Archbishop what I say . Let him tell the Cardinals and the Pope that the time has come for a Catholic Church of the Earth , the Catholic Church of All the Sons of Men . The Saviours are more than one , and let us pray they will still be increased . But God is one God , and the Saviours are the Sons of the One God . Let the Tree of the Church spread its branches over all the earth , and shelter the prophets in its shade , as they sit and speak their knowledge of the beyond . '
128439	128451	128278	128278	Ram	239	' Are you one of these prophets , Don Ram n ? '
128452	128474	128322	128322	Ram	239	' I surely am , Father . And I would speak about Quetzalcoatl in Mexico , and build his Church here . '
128475	128495	128278	128278	Ram	239	' Nay ! You would invade the Churches of Christ and the Blessed Virgin , I heard you say . '
128496	128549	128322	128322	Ram	239	' You know my intentions . But I do not want to quarrel with the Church of Rome , nor have bloodshed and enmity , Father . Can you not understand me ? Should there not be peace between the men who strive down their different ways to the God - Mystery ? '
128550	128577	128278	128278	Ram	239	' Once more desecrate the altars ! Bring in strange idols . Burn the images of Our Lord and Our Lady , and ask for peace ? '
128591	128597	128599	128599	Ram	239	' All that , Father , '
128601	128679	128322	128322	Ram	239	' Son , what can I answer ? You are a good man smitten with the madness of pride . Don Cipriano is one more Mexican general . I am the poor old Bishop of this diocese , faithful servant of the Holy Church , humble child of the Holy Father in Rome . What can I do ? What can I answer ? Take me out to the cemetery and shoot me at once , General ! '
128680	128687	128689	128689	Cipriano	239	' I do n't want to , '
128691	128698	128700	128701	the Bishop	7862	' It will end like that , '
128703	128707	128709	128710	Don Ram	239	' But why ? '
128712	128727	128709	128710	Don Ram	239	' Is there no sense in what I say ? Can not you understand ? '
128728	128773	128799	128800	the Bishop	7862	' My son , my understanding goes no farther than my faith , my duty , will allow . I am not a clever man , I live by faith and my duty to my sacred office . Understand that I do not understand . '
128774	128781	128783	128783	Ram	239	' Good - day , Father ! '
128789	128797	128799	128800	the Bishop	7862	' Go with God , my son , '
128808	128814	128816	128816	Cipriano	239	' Adi s , Señor ! '
128836	128843	128845	128846	the Bishop	7862	' Adi s , Señor General , '
128865	128871	128876	128876	he	239	' He will say nothing , '
128885	128936	128878	128878	Ram	239	' The old Jesuit , he only wants to keep his job and his power , and prevent the heart 's beating . I know them . All they treasure , even more than their money , is their centipede power over the frightened people ; especially over the women . '
128937	128946	128948	128948	Ram	239	' I did n't know you hated them , '
128950	128962	128964	128964	Cipriano	239	' Waste no more breath on them , my dear one , '
128966	128980	128964	128964	Cipriano	239	' Go forward , you can walk over broken snakes such as those . '
129042	129180	129182	129183	the General	824	' Why talk to the Bishop ? - he does n't exist any more . I hear his Knights of Cortés had a big dinner the other evening , and it is said - I do n't believe it - that they drank oaths in blood to have my life and yours . But I think the oaths of the Catholic Dames would frighten me more . Why , if a man stops to unfasten his trousers to make water , the Knights of Cortés run for their lives , thinking the pistol is pointed at them . Do n't think about them , man ! Do n't try to conciliate them . They will only puff up and become insolent , thinking you are afraid of them . Six soldiers will trample down all that dirt , '

129384	129392	129394	129394	Ram	239	' Not all the things they sing , '
129396	129400	129401	129402	the boy	1161	' They sing - '
129424	129462	129413	129413	he	1161	' Don Ram n do n't drink , do n't smoke . Doña Carlota wished he would . He 's going to wear the sky - blue cloak That he 's stolen from the Mother of God . '

129524	129544	129413	129413	he	1161	' I do n't want to be mixed up in this affair . It makes us all look ridiculous . '
129545	129578	129413	129413	he	1161	' But how do you think you look , anyhow , in your striped little sailor suit and your little saintly look ? We 'd better dress you as the Infant Jesus . '
129579	129597	129413	129413	he	1161	' No , papa ! You are in bad taste . One does n't say those things . '
129598	129638	129413	129413	he	1161	' Now you 'll have to confess to a fib . You say one does n't say those things , when I , who am your father , said them only a moment ago , and you heard me . '
129639	129650	129413	129413	he	1161	' I mean good people do n't . Decent people . '

129709	129712	129714	129716	the elder boy	4666	' Yes ! '
129720	129744	129714	129716	the elder boy	4666	' I want to come and bathe in the lake , and have a boat . But - they say it is impossible . '
129745	129748	129776	129776	you	1161	' Why ? '
129749	129762	129764	129765	The boy	1161	' They say you make yourself a peon , in your clothes . '

129805	129825	129776	129776	you	1161	' Not at all . I only pretend that the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl is coming back to the Mexicans . '
129826	129836	129776	129776	you	1161	' But , papa , it is not true . '
129837	129843	129776	129776	you	1161	' How do you know ? '
129844	129850	129776	129776	you	1161	' Because it is impossible . '
129851	129854	129776	129776	you	1161	' Why ? '
129855	129865	129776	129776	you	1161	' There never was any Quetzalcoatl , except idols . '
129866	129875	129776	129776	you	1161	' Is there any Jesus , except images ? '
129876	129881	129776	129776	you	1161	' Yes , papa . '

129886	129890	129776	129776	you	1161	' In heaven . '
129891	129919	129776	129776	you	1161	' Then in heaven there is also Quetzalcoatl . And what is in heaven is capable of coming back to earth . Do n't you believe me ? '

130115	130193	129995	129995	Ram	239	' Oh ! Oh ! I am laughing at thee now , little frog ! What name wilt thou choose , then ? Espina , perhaps . Thou knowest Carrasco is a wild bush , on the moors in Spain , where we come from . Wilt thou be the little thorn on the bush ? Call thyself Espina , thou art a sprig of the old tree . Entonces , adi s ! Señor Espina Espinita ! '
130194	130198	130200	130201	the boy	1161	' Adi s ! '

130386	130393	130394	130394	she	360	' I did n't expect you , '
130397	130407	130370	130370	She	360	' I am on my way back from town . '
130438	130446	130447	130447	she	360	' Did you see anybody in town ? '
130450	130464	130424	130424	he	239	' I saw Don Cipriano - and Doña Carlota , and my boys ! '
130465	130478	130424	130424	he	239	' Oh , how nice for you ! Are they quite well ? '
130479	130487	130424	130424	he	239	' In excellent health , I believe . '
130492	130498	130499	130499	she	360	' You are still cross , '
130502	130510	130488	130488	She	360	' Is it about the monkeys still ? '
130511	130514	130515	130515	he	239	' Señora , '
130533	130556	130515	130515	he	239	' in monkeydom I do n't know who is prince . But in the kingdom of fools , I believe it is I. '
130557	130560	130561	130561	she	360	' Why ? '
130574	130589	130571	130571	she	360	' It must be a comfort to be a prince , even of fools . '
130602	130622	130571	130571	she	360	' Oh , Señora mía ! What ails us men , when we are always wanting to be good ? '
130623	130630	130631	130631	she	360	' Are you repenting of it ? '
130634	130637	130638	130638	he	239	' Yes ! '
130641	130664	130638	130638	he	239	' I am a prince of fools ! Why have I started this Quetzalcoatl business ? Why ? Pray tell me why . '
130665	130672	130571	130571	she	360	' I suppose you wanted to . '
130684	130745	130571	130571	she	360	' Perhaps it is better to be a monkey than a fool . I object to being called a monkey , nevertheless . Carlota is a monkey , no more ; and my two boys are prize young monkeys in sailor suits . And I am a fool . Yet what is the difference between a fool and a monkey ? '
130746	130750	130752	130752	Kate	360	' Quién sabe ? '
130754	130806	130571	130571	she	360	' One wants to be good , and the other is sure he is good . So I make a fool of myself . They are sure they are always good , so that makes monkeys of them . Oh , if only the world would blow up like a bomb ! '
130807	130812	130814	130814	Kate	360	' It wo n't ! '
130816	130825	130571	130571	she	360	' True enough . - Ah , well ! '
130835	130850	130851	130852	Ram n	239	' Do you think , Señora Caterina , you might marry our mutual General ? '
130859	130867	130869	130869	Kate	360	' I - I do n't know ! '
130871	130877	130869	130869	Kate	360	' I hardly think so . '
130878	130888	130851	130852	Ram n	239	' He is not sympathetic to you at all ? '
130889	130933	130869	130869	Kate	360	' Yes , he is . He is alive , and there is even a certain fascination about him . - But one should n't try marrying a man of another race , do you think , even if he were more sympathetic ? '
130934	130937	130939	130939	Ram	239	' Ah ! '
130941	130964	130939	130939	Ram	239	' It 's no good generalizing . It 's no good marrying anybody , unless there will be a real fusion somewhere . '
130965	130973	130975	130975	Kate	360	' And I feel there would n't , '
130977	131058	130975	130975	Kate	360	' I feel he just wants something of me ; and perhaps I just want something of him . But he would never meet me . He would never come forward himself , to meet me . He would come to take something from me and I should have to let him . And I do n't want merely that . I want a man who will come half - way , just half - way , to meet me . '
131069	131074	131075	131075	he	239	' You are right , '
131078	131136	131075	131075	he	239	' Yet , in these matters , one never knows what is half - way , nor where it is . A woman who just wants to be taken , and then to cling on , is a parasite . And a man who wants just to take , without giving , is a creature of prey . '
131137	131140	131059	131061	Don Ram n	239	' And I 'm
131148	131151	131142	131143	Don Cipriano	239	' said Kate .
131152	131155	131157	131157	Ram	239	' Possibly , '
131159	131221	131157	131157	Ram	239	' He is not so with me . But perhaps he would be , if we did not meet - perhaps it is our half - way - in some physical belief that is at the very middle of us , and which we recognize in one another . Do n't you think there might be that between you and him ? '
131222	131244	131059	131061	Don Ram n	239	' I doubt if he 'd feel it necessary , with a woman . A woman would n't be important enough . '
131250	131253	131254	131254	he	239	' Perhaps ! '
131257	131509	131254	131254	he	239	' With a woman , a man always wants to let himself go . And it is precisely with a woman that he should never let himself go . It is precisely with a woman that he should never let himself go , but stick to his innermost belief , and meet her just there . Because when the innermost belief coincides in them both , if it 's physical , there , and then , and nowhere else , they can meet . And it 's no good unless there is a meeting . It 's no good a man ravishing a woman , and it 's absolutely no good a woman ravishing a man . It 's a sin , that is . There is such a thing as sin , and that 's the centre of it . Men and women keep on ravishing one another . Absurd as it may sound , it is not I who would ravish Carlota . It is she who would ravish me . Strange and absurd and a little shameful , it is true . - Letting oneself go , is either ravishing or being ravished . Oh , if we could only abide by our own souls , and meet in the abiding place . - Señora , I have not a very great respect for myself . Woman and I have failed with one another , and it is a bad failure to have in the middle of oneself . '
131572	131577	131578	131578	he	4689	' I am sorry , '
131582	131766	131578	131578	he	4689	' that Carlota and I are as we are with one another . Who am I , even to talk about Quetzalcoatl , when my heart is hollow with anger against the woman I have married and the children she bore me ? - We never met in our souls , she and I. At first I loved her , and she wanted me to ravish her . Then after a while a man becomes uneasy . He ca n't keep on wanting to ravish a woman , the same woman . He has revulsions . Then she loved me , and she wanted to ravish me . And I liked it for a time . But she had revulsions too . The eldest boy is really my boy , when I ravished her . And the youngest is her boy , when she ravished me . See how miserable it is ! And now we can never meet ; she turns to her crucified Jesus , and I to my uncrucified and uncrucifiable Quetzalcoatl , who at least can not be ravished . '
131767	131770	131772	131772	you	4690	' And I 'm
131780	131783	131772	131772	you	4690	' she said .
131784	131949	131578	131578	he	4689	' Who knows ? If I err , it will be on that side . But you know , Señora , Quetzalcoatl is to me only the symbol of the best a man may be , in the next days . The universe is a nest of dragons , with a perfectly unfathomable life - mystery at the centre of it . If I call the mystery the Morning Star , surely it does n't matter ! A man 's blood ca n't beat in the abstract . And man is a creature who wins his own creation inch by inch from the nest of the cosmic dragons . Or else he loses it little by little , and goes to pieces . Now we are all losing it , in the ravishing and ravished disintegration . We must pull ourselves together , hard , both men and women , or we are all lost . - We must pull ourselves together , hard . '
131950	131964	131965	131965	she	4693	' But are you a man who needs a woman in his life ? '
131968	131985	131986	131986	he	4694	' I am a man who yearns for the sensual fulfilment of my soul , Señora , '
131989	132130	131986	131986	he	4694	' I am a man who has no belief in abnegation of the blood desires . I am a man who is always on the verge of taking wives and concubines to live with me , so deep is my desire for that fulfilment . Except that now I know that is useless - not momentarily useless , but in the long run - my ravishing a woman with hot desire . No matter how much she is in love with me and desires me to ravish her . It is no good , and the very inside of me knows it is no good . Wine , woman , and song - all that - all that game is up . Our insides wo n't really have it any more . Yet it is hard to pull ourselves together . '
132131	132144	132146	132146	Kate	360	' So that you really want a woman to be with you ? '
132148	132218	131578	131578	he	4689	' Ah , Señora ! If I could trust myself ; and trust her ! I am no longer a young man , who can afford to make mistakes . I am forty - two years old , and I am making my last - and perhaps in truth , my first great effort as a man . I hope I may perish before I make a big mistake . '
132219	132231	131578	131578	he	4689	' Why should you make a mistake ? You need n't ? '
132232	132394	131578	131578	he	4689	' I ? It is very easy for me to make a mistake . Very easy , on the one hand , for me to become arrogant and a ravisher . And very easy , on the other hand , for me to deny myself , and make a sort of sacrifice of my life . Which is being ravished . Easy to let myself , in a certain sense , be ravished . I did it to a small degree even yesterday , with the Bishop of Guadalajara . And it is bad . If I had to end my life in a mistake , Señora , I had rather end it in being a ravisher , than in being ravished . As a hot ravisher , I can still slash and cut at the disease of the other thing , the horrible pandering and the desire men have to be ravished , the hateful , ignoble desire they have . '
132395	132449	131578	131578	he	4689	' But why do n't you do as you say , stick by the innermost soul that is in you , and meet a woman there , meet her , as you say , where your two souls coincide in their deepest desire ? Not always that horrible unbalance that you call ravishing . '
132450	132571	131578	131578	he	4689	' Why do n't I ? But which woman can I meet in the body , without that slow degradation of ravishing , or being ravished , setting in ? If I marry a Spanish woman or a dark Mexican , she will give herself up to me to be ravished . If I marry a woman of the Anglo - Saxon or any blonde northern stock , she will want to ravish me , with the will of all the ancient white demons . Those that want to be ravished are parasites on the soul , and one has revulsions . Those that want to ravish a man are vampires . And between the two , there is nothing . '
132572	132581	131578	131578	he	4689	' Surely there are some really good women ? '
132582	132717	131578	131578	he	4689	' Well , show me them . They are all potential Carlotas or - or - yes , Caterinas . I am sure you ravished your Joachim till he died . No doubt he wanted it ; even more than you wanted it . It is not just sex . It lies in the will . Victims and victimizers . The upper classes , craving to be victims to the lower classes ; or else craving to make victims of the lower classes . The politicians , craving to make one people victims to another . The Church , with its evil will for turning the people into humble , writhing things that shall crave to be victimized , to be ravished - I tell you , the earth is a place of shame . '
132718	132727	132729	132729	Kate	360	' But if you want to be different , '
132731	132741	132729	132729	Kate	360	' surely a few other people do - really . '
132742	132747	132748	132748	he	4695	' It may be , '
132754	132804	132748	132748	he	4695	' It may be . I wish I kept myself together better . I must keep myself together , keep myself within the middle place , where I am still . My Morning Star . Now I am ashamed of having talked like this to you , Señora Caterina . '
132805	132808	132809	132809	she	360	' Why ? '
132845	132848	132849	132849	he	4695	' No , '
132852	132862	132849	132849	he	4695	' I am not ashamed . I am relieved . '
132891	132895	132896	132896	he	4695	' On Sunday , '
132899	132920	132896	132896	he	4695	' will you come into the plaza , in the morning , when the drum sounds ? Will you come ? '
132921	132925	132926	132926	she	360	' What for ? '
132929	132939	132896	132896	he	4695	' Well ! Come , and you will see . '

139713	139744	139685	139685	Ram	428	' It is least trouble to let this fellow go , and you can leave by boat just whenever you wish to . So we shall all be more free . '
139802	139812	139813	139813	she	360	' Why do you have to have armed men ? '
139816	139820	139813	139813	she	360	' Oh , they 're

139853	139861	139863	139863	Kate	360	' But where do they come from ? '
139873	139878	139879	139879	he	428	' From the villages , '
140015	140025	140026	140026	she	360	' But which villages do the bandits come from ? '
140029	140046	139977	139978	Ram n	428	' Any of them . Mostly , they say , from San Pablo or from Ahuajijic . '
140047	140051	140052	140052	she	360	' Quite near ! '
140055	140060	140061	140061	he	428	' Or from Sayula , '
140064	140100	140061	140061	he	428	' Any of the ordinary men in big hats you see around the plaza may possibly be bandits , when banditry pays , as a profession , and is n't punished with any particular severity . '
140101	140108	140109	140109	she	360	' It is hard to believe ! '
140112	140118	140119	140119	he	428	' It is so obvious ! '
140140	140146	140147	140147	she	360	' I suppose it is ! '
140315	140321	140322	140322	she	360	' Where is Don Cipriano ? '
140325	140337	140338	140338	he	428	' Don Cipriano is very much General Viedma at the moment , '
140341	140350	140338	140338	he	428	' Chasing rebels in the State of Colima . '
140351	140360	140559	140559	He	5143	' Will they be very hard to chase ? '
140361	140396	140338	140338	he	428	' Probably not . Anyhow Cipriano will enjoy chasing them . He is Zapotee , and most of his men are Zapotecans , from the hills . They love chasing men who are n't . '
140397	140414	140415	140415	she	5142	' I wondered why he was n't there on Sunday when you carried away the images , '
140418	140430	140415	140415	she	5142	' I think it was an awfully brave thing to do . '
140431	140435	140436	140436	he	5143	' Do you ? '
140439	140467	140436	140436	he	5143	' It was n't . It 's never half so brave to carry something off , and destroy it , as to set a new pulse beating . '
140468	140480	140415	140415	she	5142	' But you have to destroy those old things , first . '
140481	140507	140436	140436	he	5143	' Those frowsty images - why , yes . But it 's no good until you 've got something else moving , from the inside . '
140508	140513	140415	140415	she	5142	' And have you ? '
140514	140524	140436	140436	he	5143	' I think I have . Do n't you ? '
140525	140528	140529	140529	she	5142	' Yes , '
140536	140542	140543	140543	he	5143	' I think I have , '
140546	140558	140559	140559	He	5143	' I feel there 's a new thing moving inside me . '
140569	140579	140580	140580	he	5143	' Why do n't you come and join us ? '
140583	140586	140587	140587	she	5142	' How ? '
140590	140599	140587	140587	she	5142	' By being married off to Don Cipriano ? '
140600	140615	140559	140559	He	5143	' Not necessarily . Not necessarily . Not necessarily by being married to anybody . '
140616	140625	140626	140626	she	5142	' What are you going to do next ? '
140629	140673	140559	140559	He	5143	' I ? I am going to re - open the church , for Quetzalcoatl to come in . But I do n't like lonely gods . There should be several of them , I think , for them to be happy together . '
140674	140680	140681	140681	she	5142	' Does one need gods ? '
140684	140697	140559	140559	He	5143	' Why yes . One needs manifestations , it seems to me . '
140704	140716	140717	140717	he	5144	' One needs goddesses too . That is also a dilemma , '
140724	140730	140732	140732	Kate	360	' How I would hate , '
140734	140744	140732	140732	Kate	360	' to have to be a goddess for people . '
140745	140750	140751	140751	he	5144	' For the monkeys ? '
140756	140762	140732	140732	Kate	360	' Yes ! Of course . '
140851	140860	140861	140861	he	5144	' Wo n't you go into that room ? '
140872	140890	140861	140861	he	5144	' You will be all right there . Just stay a few minutes till I come back . '

143455	143460	143461	143461	he	5218	' Creo que sí ! '
143600	143605	143607	143608	Ram n	428	' Watch the stairs ! '
143724	143742	143743	143743	he	5218	' You grazed that man with your first shot , you only stunned him , I believe , '
143746	143752	143753	143753	she	360	' Are there any more ? '
143758	143766	143753	143753	she	360	' I think they are all gone . '
143792	143798	143799	143799	she	360	' Are you much hurt ? '

143883	143904	143878	143878	he	5218	' Good that he is dead . Good that he is dead . - Good that we killed them both . '
143918	143927	143928	143928	she	360	' Ugh ! No ! It 's terrible ! '
143933	143955	143905	143905	He	5218	' Good for me that you were there ! Good that we killed them between us ! Good they are dead . '

144132	144143	144144	144144	she	360	' Why did n't your peons come and help you ? '
144147	144152	144153	144153	he	5218	' They never do ! '

And but for your being here , they would have done it ! - Ah , think of it , Señora ! Don Ram n is the most precious man in Mexico . It is possible that in the world there is not a man like him . And personally , he has n't got enemies . As a man among men , he has n't got enemies . No , Señora . Not one ! But do you know who it will be ? the priests , and the Knights of Cortés . '

One was Don Ram n 's own mozo Martin ! - ah , what a faithful man , what a brave one ! Never will Don Ram n pardon his death . Then moreover , the two men killed on the azotea , and two men in the courtyard , shot by Don Ram n. Besides these , a man whom Martin wounded , who fell and broke his leg , so we have got him .

149418	149431	149432	149432	she	5459	' What would you have done if they had killed Ram n ? '
149437	149440	149432	149432	she	5459	' I ? '
149459	149467	149442	149442	He	239	' If they had killed him ? - '
149482	149490	149491	149491	she	5459	' Would you have cared very much ? '
149494	149500	149501	149501	he	239	' I ? Would I ? '
149515	149525	149511	149511	his	239	' Would it have meant very much to you ? '
149538	149542	149543	149543	he	239	' To me ! '
149558	149572	149547	149547	he	239	' To me Ram n is more than life . More than life . '
149623	149628	149629	149629	she	5459	' More than anything ? '
149632	149635	149636	149636	he	239	' Yes ! '
149657	149663	149650	149650	he	239	' You saved his life . '
150131	150240	150242	150242	he	239	' beard hanging light from his chin , the tilt of his brows and the slight slant of his eyes , the domed Indian head with its thick black hair , they were like symbols to her , of another mystery , the mystery of the twilit , primitive world , where shapes that are small suddenly loom up huge , gigantic on the shadow , and a face like Cipriano 's is the face at once of a god and a devil , the undying Pan face . The bygone mystery , that has indeed gone by , but has not passed away . Never shall pass away .
150593	150600	150601	150601	he	239	' En poco tiempo , verdad ? '
150626	150634	150601	150601	he	239	' In a little while , no ? '
150684	150689	150679	150679	she	5472	' My demon lover ! '
150951	150956	150957	150957	Kate	450	' Are you better ? '
150960	150964	150965	150965	he	239	' Very nearly ! '
150974	150978	150965	150965	he	239	' And you ? '
150979	150987	150928	150928	Cipriano	239	' Yes , I am all right . '
150988	150992	150965	150965	he	239	' You are ? '
150993	151028	150928	150928	Cipriano	239	' Yes , I think so . - I have felt myself all lost , since that day . Spiritually , I mean . Otherwise I am all right . Are you healing well ? '
151029	151039	150965	150965	he	239	' Oh , yes ! I always heal quickly . '
151040	151048	150928	150928	Cipriano	239	' Knives and bullets are horrible things . '
151049	151057	150965	150965	he	239	' Yes - in the wrong place . '
151141	151151	151152	151152	she	5472	' I was wondering whether to go to England , '
151155	151158	151160	151160	Ram	239	' Again ? '
151168	151181	151160	151160	Ram	239	' Away from the bullets and the knives , is that it ? '
151182	151190	151192	151192	she	5472	' Yes ! - to get away . '
151196	151199	151201	151201	Ram	239	' No ! '
151203	151216	151201	151201	Ram	239	' Do n't go away . You will find nothing in England . '
151217	151225	151160	151160	Ram	239	' But can I go on here ? '
151226	151232	151201	151201	Ram	239	' Can you help it ? '
151233	151242	151160	151160	Ram	239	' I wish I knew what to do . '
151243	151268	151201	151201	Ram	239	' How can one know ? Something happens inside you , and all your decisions are smoke . - Let happen what will happen . '
151269	151288	151160	151160	Ram	239	' I ca n't quite drift as if I had no soul of my own , can I ? '
151289	151295	151201	151201	Ram	239	' Sometimes it is best . '
151321	151331	151332	151332	she	5472	' I have been thinking so much about you , '
151338	151347	151332	151332	she	5472	' and wondering whether it is worth while . '
151348	151351	151160	151160	Ram	239	' What ? '
151352	151477	151332	151332	she	5472	' What you are doing ; trying to change the religion of these people . If they have any religion to change . I do n't think they are a religious people . They are only superstitious . I have no use for men and women who go crawling down a church aisle on their knees , or holding up their arms for hours . There 's something stupid and wrong about it . They never worship a God . Only some little evil power . I have been wondering so much if it is worth while giving yourself to them , and exposing yourself to them . It would be horrible if you were really killed . I have seen you look dead . '
151478	151487	151488	151488	he	5493	' Now you see me look alive again , '
151497	151521	151522	151522	she	5494	' I believe Don Cipriano knows them better than you do . I believe he knows best , if it is any good , '
151525	151532	151534	151534	Ram	239	' And what does he say ? '
151536	151546	151548	151548	Cipriano	239	' I say I am Ram n 's man , '
151614	151623	151625	151625	Kate	450	' I feel they 'll let you down , '
151629	151691	151696	151696	his	450	' Maybe ! But I sha n't let myself down . I do what I believe in . Possibly I am only the first step round the corner of change . But : ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute - Why will you not go round the corner with us ? At least it is better than sitting still . '
151722	151738	151739	151739	she	5497	' How did those two men get in ; those two bandits on the roof ? '
151743	151796	151797	151797	Ram	450	' It was a woman this time ; a girl whom Carlota brought here from the Cuna in Mexico City , to be a sewing girl and to teach the peon 's wives to sew and do little things . She had a little room at the end of the terrace there - '
151822	151958	151797	151797	Ram	450	' She got entangled with one of the peons ; a sort of second overseer , called Guillermo . Guillermo had got a wife and four children , but he came to me to say could he change and take Maruca - the sewing girl . I said no , he could stay with his family . And I sent Maruca back to Mexico . But she had had a smattering of education , and thought she was equal to anything . She got messages through to Guillermo , and he ran away and joined her in Mexico , leaving wife and four children here . The wife then went to live with another peon - the blacksmith - whose wife had died and who was supposed to be a good match ; a decent fellow .
151959	152038	151797	151797	Ram	450	' One day appeared Guillermo , and said : could he come back ? I said not with Maruca . He said he did n't want Maruca , he wanted to come back . His wife was willing to go back to him again with the children . The blacksmith was willing to let her go . I said very well ; but he had forfeited his job as sub - overseer , and must be a peon again .
152039	152078	151797	151797	Ram	450	' And he seemed all right - satisfied . But then Maruca came and stayed in Sayula , pretending to make her living as a dressmaker . She was in with the priest ; and she got Guillermo again .
152079	152132	151797	151797	Ram	450	' It seems the Knights of Cortés had promised a big reward for the man who would bring in my scalp ; secretly , of course . The girl got Guillermo : Guillermo got those two peons , one from San Pablo and one from Ahuajijic ; somebody else arranged for the rest .
152133	152249	151797	151797	Ram	450	' The bedroom the girl used to have is that one , on the terrace not far from where the stairs go up to the roof . The bedroom has a lattice window , high up , looking out on the trees . There 's a big laurel de India growing outside . It appears the girl climbed on a table and knocked the iron lattice of the window loose , while she was living here , and that Guillermo , by taking a jump from the bough - a very risky thing , but then he was one of that sort - could land on the window - sill and pull himself into the room .
152250	152313	151797	151797	Ram	450	' Apparently he and the other two men were going to get the scalp and pillage the house before the others could enter . So the first one , the man I killed , climbed the tree , and with a long pole shoved in the lattice of the window , and so got into the room , and up the terrace stairs .
152314	152382	151797	151797	Ram	450	' Martin , my man , who was waiting on the other stairs , ready if they tried to blow out the iron door , heard the smash of the window and rushed round just as the second bandit - the one you shot - was crouching on the window - sill to jump down into the room . The window is quite small , and high up .
152383	152425	151797	151797	Ram	450	' Before Martin could do anything the man had jumped down on top of him and stabbed him twice with his machete . Then he took Martin 's knife and came up the stairs , when you shot him in the head .
152426	152479	151797	151797	Ram	450	' Martin was on the floor when he saw the hands of a third man gripping through the window . Then the face of Guillermo . Martin got up and gave the hands a slash with the heavy machete , and Guillermo fell smash back down on to the rocks under the wall .
152480	152513	151797	151797	Ram	450	' When I came down , I found Martin lying outside the door of that room . He told me - They came through there , Patr n. Guillermo was one of them .
152514	152552	151797	151797	Ram	450	' Guillermo broke his thigh on the rocks , and the soldiers found him . He confessed everything , and said he was sorry , and begged my pardon . He 's in the prison hospital now . '
152553	152557	152559	152559	Kate	450	' And Maruca ? '
152561	152568	151797	151797	Ram	450	' They 've got her too . '
152569	152577	152579	152579	Kate	450	' There will always be a traitor , '
152582	152593	152595	152595	Ram	450	' Let us hope there will also be a Catarina , '
152597	152609	151797	151797	Ram	450	' But will you go on with it - your Quetzalcoatl ? '
152610	152637	151797	151797	Ram	450	' How can I leave off ? It 's my métier now . Why do n't you join us ? Why do n't you help me ? '
152638	152641	151797	151797	Ram	450	' How ? '
152642	152694	151797	151797	Ram	450	' You will see . Soon you will hear the drums again . Soon the first day of Quetzalcoatl will come . You will see . Then Cipriano will appear - in the red serape - and Huitzilopochtli will share the Mexican Olympus with Quetzalcoatl . Then I want a goddess . '
152695	152705	152706	152706	she	5503	' But will Don Cipriano be the god Huitzilopochtli ? '
152712	152726	151797	151797	Ram	450	' First Man of Huitzilopochtli , as I am First Man of Quetzalcoatl . '
152727	152731	152733	152733	Kate	451	' Will you ? '
152737	152742	152733	152733	Kate	451	' That horrible Huitzilopochtli ? '
152743	152748	152750	152750	Cipriano	239	' Yes , Señora ! '
152767	152777	152779	152779	Ram	239	' Not the old Huitzilopochtli - but the new , '
152781	152821	152779	152779	Ram	239	' And then there must come a goddess ; wife or virgin , there must come a goddess . Why not you , as the First Woman of - say Itzpapalotl , just for the sound of the name ? '
152822	152825	152827	152827	Kate	451	' I ? '
152829	152838	152827	152827	Kate	451	' Never ! I should die of shame . '
152839	152842	152844	152844	Ram	239	' Shame ? '
152846	153012	152827	152827	Kate	451	' Ah , Señora Caterina , why shame ? This is a thing that must be done . There must be manifestations . We must change back to the vision of the living cosmos ; we must . The oldest Pan is in us , and he will not be denied . In cold blood and in hot blood both , we must make the change . That is how man is made . I accept the must from the oldest Pan in my soul , and from the newest me . Once a man gathers his whole soul together and arrives at a conclusion , the time of alternatives has gone . I must . No more than that . I am the First Man of Quetzalcoatl . I am Quetzalcoatl himself , if you like . A manifestation , as well as a man . I accept myself entire , and proceed to make destiny . Why , what else can I do ? '
153929	153934	153935	153935	she	451	' No , no ! '
153938	153943	153935	153935	she	451	' I 'll paddle . '
154218	154227	154229	154229	Cipriano	239	' Why am I not the living Huitzilopochtli ? '
154241	154248	154249	154249	she	451	' Do you feel you are ? '
154254	154257	154258	154258	he	239	' Yes , '
154269	154276	154258	154258	he	239	' It is what I feel . '
154732	154750	154751	154751	he	239	' The sun makes you pale . Lie down and rest . I will close the windows , '
154780	154788	154789	154789	he	239	' I said you were my wife , '
154800	154809	154789	154789	he	239	' It is true , is n't it ? '
154998	155009	155010	155010	he	239	' Will you come to eat at the little restaurant ? '
156000	156006	156008	156008	Kate	451	' For whom is that ? '
156012	156016	156008	156008	Kate	451	' For you ? '
156017	156020	156021	156021	he	239	' Yes , '
156024	156028	156021	156021	he	239	' For me ! '
156211	156216	156218	156218	Kate	451	' I love that ! '
156220	156226	156218	156218	Kate	451	' What is that for ? '
156227	156274	156276	156276	Cipriano	239	' It is one of Ram n 's ; they are Quetzalcoatl 's colours , the blue and white and natural black . But this one is for the day of the opening of the flowers , when he brings in the goddess who will come , '
156308	156313	156218	156218	Kate	451	' Are these yours ? '
156314	156353	156436	156436	Kate	451	' Well , they are for the messengers of Huitzilopochtli . Those are my colours : scarlet and black . But I myself have white as well , just as Ram n has a fringe of my scarlet . '
156354	156362	156363	156363	she	451	' Does n't it make you afraid ? '
156374	156380	156436	156436	Kate	451	' How make me afraid ? '
156381	156392	156393	156393	she	451	' To do this . To be the living Huitzilopochtli , '
156396	156403	156404	156404	he	5642	' I am the living Huitzilopochtli , '
156407	156435	156404	156404	he	5642	' When Ram n dares to be the living Quetzalcoatl , I dare to be the living Huitzilopochtli . I am he . - Am I not ? '
156514	156520	156505	156505	she	451	' I know you are . '
156521	156529	156530	156530	he	5642	' And on the day of flowers , '
156533	156567	156530	156530	he	5642	' you , too , shall come , in a green dress they shall weave you , with blue flowers at the seam , and on your head the new moon of flowers . '
156575	156583	156584	156584	he	5642	' Come and look at the wools , '
156620	156623	156624	156624	he	5642	' See ! '
156627	156652	156624	156624	he	5642	' You shall have a dress of green , that leaves the arms bare , and a white under - dress with blue flowers . '
156748	156800	156740	156740	she	5646	' And on the day of flowers you , too , will come . Ah ! If Ram n is the centre of a new world , a world of new flowers shall spring up round him , and push the old world back . I call you the First Flower . '
156992	157003	157005	157005	Cipriano	239	' Why not ride through the water to the boat ? '
157022	157025	157026	157026	she	451	' No , '

157323	157333	157334	157334	he	239	' It likes to be wet - who knows ? '

158271	158276	158278	158278	Cipriano	239	' What is it ? '
158280	158286	158288	158289	the boatman	1797	' More gasoline , Excellency ! '
158303	158309	158311	158311	Cipriano	239	' The water is coming , '

He sends the serpent of power up my feet and my loins So that strength wells up in me like water in hot springs . But midmost shines as the Morning Star midmost shines Between night and day , my Soul - star in one , Which is my Father whom I know not .

Night turns upon me , and Day , who am the star between . Between your breast and belly is a star . If it be not there You are empty gourd - shells filled with dust and wind . When you walk , the star walks with you , between your breast and your belly . When you sleep , it softly shines . When you speak true and true , it is bright on your lips and your teeth . When you lift your hands in courage and bravery , its glow is clear in your palms . When you turn to your wives as brave men turn to their women The Morning Star and the Evening Star shine together . For man is the Morning Star . And woman is the Star of Evening . I tell you , you are not men alone . The star of the beyond is within you . But have you seen a dead man , how his star has gone out of him ? So the star will go out of you , even as a woman will leave a man if his warmth never warms her . Should you say : I have no star ; I am no star . So it will leave you , and you will hang like a gourd on the vine of life With nothing but rind : Waiting for the rats of the dark to come and gnaw your inside . Do you hear the rats of the darkness gnawing at your inside ? Till you are as empty as rat - gnawed pomegranates hanging hollow on the Tree of Life ? If the star shone , they dare not , they could not . If you were men with the Morning Star . If the star shone within you No rat of the dark dared gnaw you . But I am Quetzalcoatl , of the Morning Star . I am the living Quetzalcoatl . And you are men who should be men of the Morning Star . See you be not rat - gnawed gourds .

You stole the very sunshine out of the sky and the sap out of the earth . Because back again , what did you pour ? Only the water of dead dilution into the mixing - bowl of life , you thief .

171486	171495	171447	171449	The young Cyprian	391	' The only one . Where God is . '
171496	171502	171447	171449	The young Cyprian	391	' And where is that ? '

And there the souls of the dead come to rest , there , at the very centre , where the blood turns and returns ; that is where the dead sleep best . '
171607	171620	171622	171622	Cyprian	391	' And wilt thou go on saying thou art the Living Quetzalcoatl ? '

171647	171672	171447	171449	The young Cyprian	391	' Never ! Thou hast killed our mother , and we shall hate thee . When we are men we ought to kill thee . '
171673	171838	171447	171449	The young Cyprian	391	' Nay , that is bombast , child ! Why wilt thou listen only to servants and priests and people of that sort ? Are they not thy inferiors , since thou art my son , and thy mother 's son ? Why dost thou take the talk of servants and inferiors into thy mouth ? Hast thou no room for the speech of brave men ? Thou wilt not kill me , neither will thy brother . For I would not allow you , even if you wished it . And you do not wish it . Talk no more of this empty lackey - talk to me , Cyprian , for I will not hear it . Art thou already a little lackey , or a priest ? Come , thou art vulgar . Thou art a little vulgarian . We had better speak English ; or thy French . Castilian is too good a language to turn into this currish talk . '
171881	171951	171447	171449	The young Cyprian	391	' The sun has climbed the hill , the day is on the downward slope . Between the morning and the afternoon , stand I here with my soul , and lift it up . My soul is heavy with sunshine , and steeped with strength . The sunbeams have filled me like a honeycomb , It is the moment of fulness , And the top of the morning . '

171979	172087	171976	171976	he	253	' Why are you confused ? If I talked to you about your new boots , or ten pesos , you would not be confused . But if I speak of the sun and your own souls filled from the sun like honeycombs , you sulk . You had better go back to your school in America , to learn to be business men . You had better say to everybody : Oh , no ! we have no father ! Our mother died , but we never had a father . We are children of an immaculate conception , so we should make excellent business men . '
172088	172095	172097	172097	Cyprian	391	' I shall be a priest , '

But the touch , the look , the word that goes from one naked man to another is the mystery of living . We live by manifestations .
173901	174004	173754	173754	He	239	' And men are fragile , and fragments , and strangely grouped in their fragmentariness . The invisible God has done it to us , darkened some faces and whitened others , and grouped us in groups , even as the zopilote is a bird , and the parrot of the hot lands is a bird , and the little oriole is a bird . But the angel of the zopilotes must be a zopilote , and the angel of the parrots a parrot . And to one , the dead carcase will ever smell good ; to the other , the fruit .

And when every peon in Mexico wears an American suit of clothes and shiny black shoes , and looks for life in the newspaper and for his manhood to the government , will you be satisfied ? Did the government , then , give you your manhood , that you expect it to give it to these others ?
174142	174180	173754	173754	He	239	' It is time to forget . It is time to put away the grudge and the pity . No man was ever the better for being pitied , and every man is the worse for a grudge .

But every time we deny the living life , in order to solve a problem , we cause ten problems to spring up where was one before . Solving the problems of the people , we lose the people in a poisonous forest of problems .
174263	174310	174065	174065	he	6168	' Life makes , and moulds , and changes the problem . The problem will always be there , and will always be different . So nothing can be solved , even by life and living , for life dissolves and resolves , solving it leaves alone .

174984	174990	174065	174065	he	6168	' I found the other strength .

175084	175088	175090	175090	he	6170	' and here ! '
175095	175099	175101	175101	he	6170	' and here ! '
175106	175117	175101	175101	he	6170	' The strength that comes from back of the sun . '
175198	175216	175191	175191	they	9331	' It is Cipriano ! It is he ! We are Ciprianistos , we are his children . '

175230	175253	175191	175191	they	9331	' But listen . There are two kinds of men . There are men with the second strength , and men without it .

175289	175345	175191	175191	they	9331	' Like cunning ones , they stole it on the sly . They kept very still , like a tarantula in his hole . Then when neither sun nor moon nor stars knew he was there , Biff ! - the tarantula sprang across , and bit , and left the poison and sucked the secret .
175346	175392	175191	175191	they	9331	' So they got the secrets of the air and the water , and they got the secrets out of the earth . So the metals were theirs , and they made guns and machines and ships , and they made trains and telegrams and radio .
175393	175409	175191	175191	they	9331	' Why ? Why did they make all these things ? How could they do it ?
175410	175432	175191	175191	they	9331	' Because , by cunning , they had got the secret of the second strength , which comes from behind the sun .
175433	175456	175191	175191	they	9331	' And we had to be slaves , because we had only got the first strength , we had lost the second strength .

175618	175640	175547	175547	he	6173	' Are we men ? Can we not get the second strength ? Can we not ? Have we lost it forever ?
175641	175661	175613	175613	he	6173	' I say no ! Quetzalcoatl is among us . I have found the red Huitzilopochtli . The second strength !
175662	175693	175547	175547	he	6173	' When you walk or sit , when you work or lie down , when you eat or sleep , think of the second strength , that you must have it .
175694	175709	175613	175613	he	6173	' Be very quiet . It is shy as a bird in a dark tree .
175710	175735	175547	175547	he	6173	' Be very clean , clean in your bodies and your clothes . It is like a star , that will not shine in dirt .
175736	175794	175613	175613	he	6173	' Be very brave , and do not drink till you are drunk , nor soil yourself with bad women , nor steal . Because a drunken man has lost his second strength , and a man loses his strength in bad women , and a thief is a coward , and the red Huitzilopochtli hates a coward .
175795	175815	175547	175547	he	6173	' Try ! Try for the second strength . When we have it , the others will lose it . '
175910	175917	175918	175918	he	239	' Give me something to eat , '
175922	175928	175918	175918	he	239	' Give me an enchilada ! '

176706	176763	176679	176679	He	239	' This is the oil of the stars . Rub it well into your limbs and you will be strong as the starry sky . This is the red blood of volcanoes . Rub yourselves with it , you will have the power of the fire of the volcanoes , from the centre of the earth . '
176788	176875	176764	176764	He	239	' If you know how to tread the dance , you can tread deeper and deeper , till you touch the middle of the earth with your foot . And when you touch the middle of the earth , you will have such power in your belly and your breast , no man will be able to overcome you . Get the second strength . Get it , get it out of the earth , get it from behind the sun . Get the second strength . '
176976	176987	176967	176967	he	239	' I am the red Huitzilopochtli , of the knife . '

177142	177190	177136	177136	he	239	' They must learn again to move swiftly and untiringly , with the old power . They must not lie about . In the sleep hours , let them sleep . In the waking , let them work , or march , or drill , or dance . '
177230	177235	177236	177236	Cipriano	239	' Perfect your hundred , '
177239	177252	177236	177236	Cipriano	239	' and I will perfect your thousands and your tens of thousands . '

177260	177358	177257	177257	he	239	' For us , no trench and cannon warfare . My men are no cannon - fodder , nor trench - dung . Where cannon are , we move away . Our hundreds break up , and we attack where the cannon are not . That we are swift , that we are silent , that we have no burdens , and that the second strength is in us : that is all . We intend to put up no battle - front , but to attack at our own moment , and at a thousand points . '
177364	177409	177361	177361	he	239	' If you can get the power from the heart of the earth , and the power from behind the sun ; if you can summon the power of the red Huitzilopochtli into you , nobody can conquer you . Get the second strength . '
177423	177426	177427	177427	he	239	' Come ! '
177430	177451	177427	177427	he	239	' It is time you let General Viedma be swallowed up in the red Huitzilopochtli . Do n't you think ? '

192467	192485	192487	192487	Ram	435	' Now there is a hostess , wo n't you come and stay some time at Jamiltepec ? '
192489	192497	192499	192499	Teresa	435	' Oh , do ! Do come ! '
192501	192509	192511	192511	Kate	360	' But do you really want me ? '
192515	192520	192522	192522	Teresa	435	' Yes ! Yes ! '
192524	192532	192534	192534	Ram	435	' She needs a woman - friend , '
192538	192544	192545	192545	she	435	' Yes , I do ! '
192548	192573	192545	192545	she	435	' I have never had a true , true woman - friend : only when I was at school , and we were girls . '
192611	192624	192625	192625	she	360	' Yes , I should like to come for a few days , '
192628	192633	192635	192635	Teresa	435	' Oh , yes ! '
192637	192643	192635	192635	Teresa	435	' When will you come ? '
192649	192659	192661	192661	Ram	435	' And we will write the Song of Malintzi , '
192663	192669	192671	192671	Kate	360	' Do n't do that ! '
192936	192943	192944	192944	she	491	' My arms are so thin ! '
192958	192966	192944	192944	she	491	' They are not beautiful like yours . '
192986	192989	192990	192990	she	360	' No ! '
192995	193017	192990	192990	she	360	' Your arms are not thin : they are exactly right for your figure , and pretty and young and brown . '
193018	193029	193031	193031	Teresa	491	' But make the sleeves long , to the wrist , '
193048	193059	193061	193061	Teresa	491	' The men here do n't like little thin women , '
193065	193075	193077	193077	Kate	360	' One does n't care what the men like , '
193079	193093	193077	193077	Kate	360	' Do you think Don Ram n wishes you were a plump partridge ? '
193121	193125	193126	193126	she	491	' Who knows ! '
193435	193439	193440	193440	he	587	' One day , '
193443	193469	193440	193440	he	587	' we will put Quetzalcoatl in Puebla Cathedral , and Huitzilopochtli in Mexico Cathedral and Malintzi in Guadalupe . The day will come , Ram n. '
193470	193478	193479	193479	Ram	239	' We will see that it comes , '
194830	194832	194822	194822	Kate	360	' I 'm
194844	194844	194836	194836	I	0	'
194845	194854	194856	194857	Ram n	371	' I wanted to be under the sky ! '
194864	194871	194873	194873	Kate	360	' Oh , do n't move ! '
194875	194889	194873	194873	Kate	360	' It was stupid of me to come here . You are tired . '
194890	194893	194894	194894	he	371	' Yes , '
194900	194928	194894	194894	he	371	' I am tired . These people make me feel I have a hole in the middle of me . So I have come back to Teresa . '
194929	194932	194934	194934	Kate	360	' Yes ! '
194936	194973	194934	194934	Kate	360	' One is n't the Living Quetzalcoatl for nothing . Of course they eat holes in you . - Really , is it worth it ? - To give yourself to be eaten away by them . '
194974	194980	194981	194981	he	371	' It must be so , '
194984	195007	194981	194981	he	371	' The change has to be made . And some man has to make it . I sometimes wish it was n't I. '
195008	195032	195034	195034	Kate	360	' So do I wish it . So does Teresa . One wonders if it is n't better to be just a man , '
195041	195059	195060	195060	he	371	' One does what one must . And after all , one is always just a man , '
195063	195076	195060	195060	he	371	' And if one has wounds - la guerre comme la guerre ! '
195088	195091	195093	195093	Kate	360	' Ah ! '
195095	195120	195093	195093	Kate	360	' It makes one wonder what a man is , that he must needs expose himself to the horrors of all the other people . '
195128	195142	195143	195143	he	371	' Man is a column of blood , with a voice in it , '
195146	195167	195143	195143	he	371	' And when the voice is still , and he is only a column of blood , he is better . '
195499	195502	195504	195504	Kate	360	' Ah ! '
195508	195510	195506	195506	herself	360	' I 'm
195526	195526	195506	195506	herself	360	'
195580	195586	195588	195588	Kate	360	' How is Ram n ? '
195590	195595	195597	195597	Teresa	491	' He is sleeping , '
195599	195613	195619	195621	The black eyes	6796	' Good ! He seemed to me almost done up , last night . '
195614	195617	195619	195621	The black eyes	6796	' Yes . '
195641	195656	195658	195658	Kate	360	' I do n't believe in a man 's sacrificing himself in this way , '
195660	195666	195658	195658	Kate	360	' And I do n't . '
195676	195679	195680	195680	she	491	' Ah ! '
195683	195709	195680	195680	she	491	' He does n't sacrifice himself . He feels he must do as he does . And if he must , I must help him . '
195710	195729	195731	195731	Kate	360	' But then you are sacrificing yourself to him , and I do n't believe in that either , '
195733	195738	195740	195740	Teresa	491	' Oh , no ! '
195758	195788	195753	195753	her	491	' I am not sacrificing myself to Ram n. If I can give him - sleep - when he needs it - that is not sacrifice . It is - '
195805	195813	195815	195815	Kate	360	' It is love , I know , '
195817	195824	195815	195815	Kate	360	' But it exhausts you too . '
195825	195832	195834	195834	Teresa	491	' It is not simply love , '
195837	195863	195834	195834	Teresa	491	' I might have loved more than one man : many men are lovable . But Ram n ! - My soul is with Ram n. '
195872	195882	195883	195883	she	491	' I do not want to talk about it , '
195888	195901	195883	195883	she	491	' But you must not touch me there , and judge me . '
195946	195955	195956	195956	she	491	' I am sorry if I was rude , '
195959	195962	195964	195964	Kate	360	' No , '
195966	195975	195964	195964	Kate	360	' Apparently it is I who am wrong . '
195976	195984	195986	195986	Teresa	491	' Yes , I think you are , '
195988	196004	195986	195986	Teresa	491	' You think there is only love . Love is only such a little bit . '
196005	196012	195964	195964	Kate	360	' And what is the rest ? '
196013	196041	195986	195986	Teresa	491	' How can I tell you if you do not know ? - But do you think Ram n is no more to me than a lover ? '
196042	196046	196048	196048	Kate	360	' A husband ! '
196050	196053	196054	196054	Teresa	491	' Ah ! '
196064	196084	196054	196054	Teresa	491	' Those little words ! Those little words ! Nor either a husband . - He is my life . '
196085	196099	195986	195986	Teresa	491	' Surely it is better for one to live one 's own life ! '
196100	196204	196054	196054	Teresa	491	' No ! It is like seed . It is no good till it is given . I know . I kept my own life for a long time . As you keep it longer , it dies . And I tried to give it to God . But I could n't , quite . Then they told me , if I married Ram n and had any part in the Quetzalcoatl heresy , my soul would be damned . - But something made me know it was not true . I even knew he needed my soul . - Ah , Señora - '
196215	196231	196210	196210	Teresa	491	' I have lost my soul to Ram n. - What more can I say ! '
196232	196239	196054	196054	Teresa	491	' And what about his soul ? '
196240	196249	196250	196250	She	491	' It comes home to me - here ! '
196265	196272	196273	196273	she	491	' And if he betrays you ? '
196276	196281	196283	196283	Teresa	491	' Ah , Señora ! '
196285	196348	196349	196349	she	491	' Ram n is not just a lover . He is a brave man , and he does n't betray his own blood . And it is his soul that comes home to me . - And I would struggle to my last breath to give him sleep , when he came home to me with his soul , and needed it , '
196360	196485	196353	196353	she	491	' No , thank God ! I have not got a life of my own ! I have been able to give it to a man who is more than a man , as they say in their Quetzalcoatl language . And now it need n't die inside me , like a bird in a cage . - Oh , yes , Señora ! If he goes to Sinaloa and the west coast , my soul goes with him and takes part in it all . It does not let him go alone . And he does not forget that he has my soul with him . I know it . - No , Señora ! You must not criticise me or pity me . '
196486	196489	196491	196491	Kate	360	' Still ! '
196493	196518	196353	196353	she	491	' It still seems to me it would be better for each one to keep her own soul , and be responsible for it . '
196519	196525	196527	196527	Teresa	491	' If it were possible ! '
196529	196746	196527	196527	Teresa	491	' But you can no more keep your own soul inside you for yourself , without its dying , than you can keep the seed of your womb . Until a man gives you his seed , the seed of your womb is nothing . And the man 's seed is nothing to him . - And until you give your soul to a man , and he takes it , your soul is nothing to you . - And when a man has taken your whole soul . - Ah , do not talk to me about betraying . A man only betrays because he has been given a part , and not the whole . And a woman only betrays because only the part has been taken from her , and not the whole . That is all about betrayal . I know . - But when the whole is given , and taken , betrayal ca n't exist . What I am to Ram n , I am . And what he is to me , he is . I do not care what he does . If he is away from me , he does as he wishes . So long as he will always keep safe what I am to him . '
197278	197284	197285	197285	Teresa	491	' You did not sleep ? '
197290	197295	197297	197297	Kate	360	' Not very well , '
197299	197318	197285	197285	Teresa	491	' No , you look as if you had not slept very well . - Under your eyes . '
197329	197337	197338	197338	she	360	' One gets that look in Mexico , '
197341	197360	197338	197338	she	360	' It 's not an easy country to keep your youth in . - You are looking well . '
197361	197369	197319	197319	Kate	360	' Yes , I am very well . '
197400	197413	197415	197415	Kate	360	' I think I will go home now Ram n has come , '
197417	197427	197319	197319	Kate	360	' Oh , why ? Do you wish to ? '
197428	197435	197415	197415	Kate	360	' I think I 'd better . '
197436	197452	197319	197319	Kate	360	' Then I will go with you to Sayula . In the boat , no ? '
197535	197542	197543	197543	Kate	360	' I have been married too , '
197547	197558	197543	197543	Kate	360	' To a very exceptional man , whom I loved . '
197559	197564	197566	197566	Teresa	491	' Ah , yes ! '
197568	197573	197566	197566	Teresa	491	' And he died . '
197574	197580	197543	197543	Kate	360	' He wanted to die . '
197581	197591	197566	197566	Teresa	491	' Ah , yes ! He wanted to die . '
197592	197606	197543	197543	Kate	360	' I did my level best to prevent him from wearing himself out . '
197607	197616	197566	197566	Teresa	491	' Ah , yes , to prevent him . '
197617	197625	197627	197627	Kate	360	' What else could I have done ? '
197631	197650	197566	197566	Teresa	491	' If you could have given him your life , he would not even have wanted to die . '
197651	197690	197566	197566	Teresa	491	' I did give him my life . I loved him - oh , you will never know . - But he did n't want my soul . He believed I should keep a soul of my own . '
197691	197936	197566	197566	Teresa	491	' Ah , yes , men are like that , when they are merely men . When a man is warm and brave - then he wants the woman to give him her soul , and he keeps it in his womb , so he is more than a mere man , a single man . I know it . I know where my soul is . It is in Ram n 's womb , the womb of a man , just as his seed is in my womb , the womb of a woman . He is a man , and a column of blood . I am a woman , and a valley of blood . I shall not contradict him . How can I ? My soul is inside him , and I am far from contradicting him when he is trying with all his might to do something that he knows about . He wo n't die , and they wo n't kill him . No ! The stream flows into him from the heart of the world : and from me . - I tell you , because you saved his life , and therefore we belong to the same thing , you and I and he - and Cipriano . But you should not misjudge me . That other way of women , where a woman keeps her own soul - ah , what is it but weariness ! '
197937	197942	197988	197988	she	360	' And the men ? '
197943	197966	197566	197566	Teresa	491	' Ah ! if there are men whose souls are warm and brave , how they comfort one 's womb , Caterina ! '
198202	198215	198217	198217	Kate	360	' It is like Europe - like the Tyrol to - day , '
198220	198228	198230	198230	Teresa	491	' Do you love Europe very much ? '
198232	198241	198287	198287	she	360	' Yes , I think I love it . '
198242	198251	198287	198287	she	360	' And must you go back to it ? '
198252	198266	198287	198287	she	360	' I think so . Soon ! To my mother and my children . '
198267	198275	198287	198287	she	360	' Do they want you very much ? '
198276	198279	198281	198281	Kate	360	' Yes ! '
198290	198302	198287	198287	she	360	' Not very much , really . But I want them . '
198303	198311	198312	198312	Teresa	491	' What for ? - I mean , '
198315	198322	198312	198312	Teresa	491	' do you long for them ? '
198323	198326	198328	198328	Kate	360	' Sometimes , '
198344	198348	198349	198349	Teresa	491	' And Cipriano ? '
198353	198356	198358	198358	Kate	360	' Ah ! '
198361	198370	198358	198358	Kate	360	' He is such a stranger to me . '
198378	198391	198393	198393	Teresa	491	' I think a man is always a stranger to a woman , '
198395	198403	198393	198393	Teresa	491	' Why should it not be so ? '
198404	198408	198410	198410	Kate	360	' But you , '
198412	198418	198410	198410	Kate	360	' have n't any children . '
198419	198469	198393	198393	Teresa	491	' Ram n has . - And he says : " I cast my bread upon the waters . It is my children too . And if they return to me after many days , I shall be glad . " - Is it not the same for you ? '
198470	198474	198476	198476	Kate	360	' Not quite ! '
198478	198490	198476	198476	Kate	360	' I am a woman , I am not a man . '
198491	198499	198501	198501	Teresa	491	' I , if I have children , '
198503	198596	198501	198501	Teresa	491	' I shall try to cast my bread upon the waters , so my children come to me that way . I hope I shall . I hope I shall not try to fish them out of life for myself , with a net . I have a very great fear of love . It is so personal . Let each bird fly with its own wings , and each fish swim its own course . - Morning brings more than love . And I want to be true to the morning . '
201267	201286	201287	201287	she	360	' It does n't matter to me very much whether I marry or not , before I go , '
201290	201299	201287	201287	she	360	' But I must go soon - soon . '
201300	201304	201310	201310	His	239	' How soon ? '
201305	201309	201287	201287	she	360	' By January . '
201315	201323	201324	201324	he	239	' Then marry me before you go , '
201327	201331	201324	201324	he	239	' Next week . '
202738	202741	202733	202733	she	360	' satisfaction . '

204654	204661	204662	204662	Ram	239	' Yet you must go away ? '
204668	204687	204662	204662	Ram	239	' For a little while . You do n't think I am Lot 's wife , do you ? '

206861	206864	206865	206865	Kate	360	' Oh ! '
206869	206904	206865	206865	Kate	360	' To get back to simple life . To see the buses rolling on the mud in Piccadilly , on Christmas Eve , and the wet pavements crowded with people under the brilliant shops . '

206917	206944	206865	206865	Kate	360	' Yes ! Without all this abstraction , and will . Life is good enough for me if I am allowed to live and be myself . '

208043	208244	208016	208016	Teresa	491	' For myself , I am afraid of it . But I understand that Ram n wants it . He says it is accepting the greater responsibility of one 's existence . And I think that is true . If there is God in me , and God as woman , then I must accept this part of myself also , and put on the green dress , and be for the time the God - woman , since it is true of me also . I think it is true . Ram n says we must make it manifest . When I think of my brothers , I know we must . So I shall think of the God that beats invisible , like the heart of all the world . So when I have to wear the green dress , and sit before all the people in the church , I shall look away to the heart of all the world , and try to be my sacred self , because it is necessary , and the right thing to do . It is right . I would not do it if I thought it was not right . '
208245	208259	208261	208261	Kate	360	' But I thought the green dress was for the Bride of Huitzilopochtli ! '

208273	208289	208268	208268	Teresa	491	' Mine is the black dress with the white edges , and the red clouds . '

208322	208332	208333	208333	she	491	' The green is for the wife of Huitzilopochtli , '

208443	208451	208440	208440	Kate	360	' He takes too much upon himself . '
208474	208488	208489	208489	she	491	' How do you know that Ram n needs submission from a woman ? '
208492	208586	208489	208489	she	491	' How do you know ? He has not asked any submission from you . - And you are wrong . He does not ask submission from me . He wants me to give myself gently to him . And then he gives himself back to me far more gently than I give myself to him . Because a man like that is more gentle than a woman . He is not like Cipriano . Cipriano is a soldier . But Ram n is gentle . You are mistaken in what you say . '
208592	208606	208607	208607	Teresa	491	' And you are a soldier among women , fighting all the time , '
208610	208664	208607	208607	Teresa	491	' I am not such . But some women must be soldiers in their spirit , and they need soldier husbands . That is why you are Malintzi , and your dress is green . You would always fight . You would fight with yourself , if you were alone in the world . '

209786	209817	209745	209745	Kate	360	' Yes , I am . But everywhere else it is denied . Only here one feels the full force of one 's nobility . The natives still worship it . '

209907	209911	209912	209912	he	239	' I know , '

209924	209954	209977	209977	she	360	' Unless one gets one 's nobility from the gods and turns to the middle of the sky for one 's power , one will be murdered at last . '

If ones tries to be unlimited , one becomes horrible . Without Cipriano to touch me and limit me and submerge my will , I shall become a horrible , elderly female . I ought to want to be limited . I ought to be glad if a man will limit me with a strong will and a warm touch . Because what I call my greatness , and the vastness of the Lord behind me , lets me fall through a hollow floor of nothingness , once there is no man 's hand there , to hold me warm and limited . Ah yes ! Rather than become elderly and a bit grisly , I will make my submission ; as far as I need , and no further . '

I may as well stay here , where my soul is less dreary . I shall have to tell Ram n I am sorry for the things I said . I wo n't carp at them . After all , there is another kind of vastness here , with the sound of drums , and the cry of Quetzalcoatl . '
