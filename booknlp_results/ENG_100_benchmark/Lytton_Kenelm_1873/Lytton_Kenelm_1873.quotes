But this Sally would not have been thought fast in another household , and she was now little likely to sally out of the one she belonged to . These sisters , who were all many years older than Sir Peter , lived in a handsome , old - fashioned , red - brick house , with a large garden at the back , in the principal street of the capital of their native county . They had each L10,000 for portion ; and if he could have married all three , the heir - at - law would have married them , and settled the aggregate L30,000 on himself .

4513	4520	4522	4523	Sir Peter	421	" I AGREE with Mr. Shandy , "
4532	4994	4522	4523	Sir Peter	421	" that among the responsibilities of a parent the choice of the name which his child is to bear for life is one of the gravest . And this is especially so with those who belong to the order of baronets . In the case of a peer his Christian name , fused into his titular designation , disappears . In the case of a Mister , if his baptismal be cacophonous or provocative of ridicule , he need not ostentatiously parade it : he may drop it altogether on his visiting cards , and may be imprinted as Mr. Jones instead of Mr. Ebenezer Jones . In his signature , save where the forms of the law demand Ebenezer in full , he may only use an initial and be your obedient servant E. Jones , leaving it to be conjectured that E. stands for Edward or Ernest , - names inoffensive , and not suggestive of a Dissenting Chapel , like Ebenezer . If a man called Edward or Ernest be detected in some youthful indiscretion , there is no indelible stain on his moral character : but if an Ebenezer be so detected he is set down as a hypocrite ; it produces that shock on the public mind which is felt when a professed saint is proved to be a bit of a sinner . But a baronet never can escape from his baptismal : it can not lie perdu ; it can not shrink into an initial , it stands forth glaringly in the light of day ; christen him Ebenezer , and he is Sir Ebenezer in full , with all its perilous consequences if he ever succumb to those temptations to which even baronets are exposed . But , my friends , it is not only the effect that the sound of a name has upon others which is to be thoughtfully considered : the effect that his name produces on the man himself is perhaps still more important . Some names stimulate and encourage the owner ; others deject and paralyze him : I am a melancholy instance of that truth . Peter has been for many generations , as you are aware , the baptismal to which the eldest - born of our family has been devoted . On the altar of that name I have been sacrificed . Never has there been a Sir Peter Chillingly who has , in any way , distinguished himself above his fellows . That name has been a dead weight on my intellectual energies . In the catalogue of illustrious Englishmen there is , I think , no immortal Sir Peter , except Sir Peter Teazle , and he only exists on the comic stage . "
4999	5004	4995	4996	MISS SIBYL	215	" Sir Peter Lely ? "
5010	5105	5005	5007	SIR PETER CHILLINGLY	421	" That painter was not an Englishman . He was born in Westphalia , famous for hams . I confine my remarks to the children of our native land . I am aware that in foreign countries the name is not an extinguisher to the genius of its owner . But why ? In other countries its sound is modified . Pierre Corneille was a great man ; but I put it to you whether , had he been an Englishman , he could have been the father of European tragedy as Peter Crow ? "
5110	5113	5106	5107	MISS SIBYL	215	" Impossible ! "

5162	5226	5156	5159	MR . CHILLINGLY GORDON	193	" If a man is such a fool - and I do n't say your son will not be a fool , Cousin Peter - as to be influenced by the sound of his own name , and you want the booby to turn the world topsy - turvy , you had better call him Julius Caesar or Hannibal or Attila or Charlemagne . "
5239	5385	5227	5228	SIR PETER	421	" On the contrary , if you inflict upon a man the burden of one of those names , the glory of which he can not reasonably expect to eclipse or even to equal , you crush him beneath the weight . If a poet were called John Milton or William Shakspeare , he could not dare to publish even a sonnet . No : the choice of a name lies between the two extremes of ludicrous insignificance and oppressive renown . For this reason I have ordered the family pedigree to be suspended on yonder wall . Let us examine it with care , and see whether , among the Chillinglys themselves or their alliances , we can discover a name that can be borne with becoming dignity by the destined head of our house - a name neither too light nor too heavy . "

5459	5473	5475	5478	the Rev. John Stalworth	202	" I never could quite make out what kind of fishes these are , "
5480	5512	5475	5478	the Rev. John Stalworth	202	" They are certainly not pike which formed the emblematic blazon of the Hotofts , and are still grim enough to frighten future Shakspeares on the scutcheon of the Warwickshire Lucys . "
5513	5520	5522	5523	Mr. Mivers	196	" I believe they are tenches , "
5525	5552	5522	5523	Mr. Mivers	196	" The tench is a fish that knows how to keep itself safe by a philosophical taste for an obscure existence in deep holes and slush . "
5557	5761	5553	5554	SIR PETER	421	" No , Mivers ; the fishes are dace , a fish that , once introduced into any pond , never can be got out again . You may drag the water ; you may let off the water ; you may say , ' Those dace are extirpated , ' - vain thought ! - the dace reappear as before ; and in this respect the arms are really emblematic of the family . All the disorders and revolutions that have occurred in England since the Heptarchy have left the Chillinglys the same race in the same place . Somehow or other the Norman Conquest did not despoil them ; they held fiefs under Eudo Dapifer as peacefully as they had held them under King Harold ; they took no part in the Crusades , nor the Wars of the Roses , nor the Civil Wars between Charles the First and the Parliament . As the dace sticks to the water and the water sticks by the dace , so the Chillinglys stuck to the land and the land stuck by the Chillinglys . Perhaps I am wrong to wish that the new Chillingly may be a little less like a dace . "
5762	5765	5767	5768	Miss Margaret	212	" Oh ! "
5788	5804	5767	5768	Miss Margaret	212	" I do n't see a fine Christian name from the beginning , except Oliver . "
5809	5868	5805	5806	SIR PETER	421	" That Chillingly was born in Oliver Cromwell 's Protectorate , and named Oliver in compliment to him , as his father , born in the reign of James I. , was christened James . The three fishes always swam with the stream . Oliver ! - Oliver not a bad name , but significant of radical doctrines . "
5873	5903	5869	5870	Mr. MIVERS	196	" I do n't think so . Oliver Cromwell made short work of radicals and their doctrines ; but perhaps we can find a name less awful and revolutionary . "
5904	5913	5915	5916	the Parson	908	" I have it ! I have it ! "
5918	5966	5915	5916	the Parson	908	" Here is a descent from Sir Kenelm Digby and Venetia Stanley . Sir Kenelm Digby ! No finer specimen of muscular Christianity . He fought as well as he wrote ; eccentric , it is true , but always a gentleman . Call the boy Kenelm ! "
5967	5972	5974	5975	Miss Sibyl	215	" A sweet name , "
5977	5983	5974	5975	Miss Sibyl	215	" it breathes of romance . "
5984	5996	5998	5999	Miss Margaret	212	" Sir Kenelm Chillingly ! It sounds well , - imposing ! "
6001	6004	6006	6007	Mr. Mivers	196	" And , "
6009	6095	6006	6007	Mr. Mivers	196	" it has this advantage - that while it has sufficient association with honourable distinction to affect the mind of the namesake and rouse his emulation , it is not that of so stupendous a personage as to defy rivalry . Sir Kenelm Digby was certainly an accomplished and gallant gentleman ; but what with his silly superstition about sympathetic powders , etc . , any man nowadays might be clever in comparison without being a prodigy . Yes , let us decide on Kenelm . "
6100	6103	6105	6105	he	421	" Certainly , "
6111	6177	6105	6105	he	421	" certainly the name of Kenelm carries with it very crotchety associations ; and I am afraid that Sir Kenelm Digby did not make a prudent choice in marriage . The fair Venetia was no better than she should be ; and I should wish my heir not to be led away by beauty but we d a woman of respectable character and decorous conduct . "
6182	6190	6178	6179	Miss MARGARET	212	" A British matron , of course ! "
6197	6204	6178	6179	Miss MARGARET	212	" Of course ! of course ! "
6205	6208	6210	6211	Sir Peter	421	" But , "
6213	6284	6210	6211	Sir Peter	421	" I am crotchety myself , and crotchets are innocent things enough ; and as for marriage the Baby can not marry to - morrow , so that we have ample time to consider that matter . Kenelm Digby was a man any family might be proud of ; and , as you say , sister Margaret , Kenelm Chillingly does not sound amiss : Kenelm Chillingly it shall be ! "
6318	6321	6323	6323	he	193	" Cousin , "
6327	6355	6323	6323	he	193	" I do not blame you for the want of family affection , or even of humane interest , which you exhibit towards the New - born . "
6356	6388	6323	6323	he	193	" Blame me , Cousin Peter ! I should think not . I exhibit as much family affection and humane interest as could be expected from me , - circumstances considered . "
6389	6393	6395	6396	Sir Peter	421	" I own , "
6404	6603	6395	6396	Sir Peter	421	" that after remaining childless for fourteen years of wedded life , the advent of this little stranger must have occasioned you a disagreeable surprise . But , after all , as I am many years younger than you , and in the course of nature shall outlive you , the loss is less to yourself than to your son , and upon that I wish to say a few words . You know too well the conditions on which I hold my estate not to be aware that I have not legally the power to saddle it with any bequest to your boy . The New - born succeeds to the fee - simple as last in tail . But I intend , from this moment , to lay by something every year for your son out of my income ; and , fond as I am of London for a part of the year , I shall now give up my town - house . If I live to the years the Psalmist allots to man , I shall thus accumulate something handsome for your son , which may be taken in the way of compensation . "
6628	6647	6652	6652	he	193	" My son will be very much obliged to you , should he ever need your intended bequest . "
6659	6675	6652	6652	he	193	" A large percentage of infants die before attaining the age of twenty - one . "
6676	6692	6652	6652	he	193	" Nay , but I am told your son is an uncommonly fine healthy child . "
6693	6801	6652	6652	he	193	" My son , Cousin Peter ! I was not thinking of my son , but of yours . Yours has a big head . I should not wonder if he had water in it . I do n't wish to alarm you , but he may go off any day , and in that case it is not likely that Lady Chillingly will condescend to replace him . So you will excuse me if I still keep a watchful eye on my rights ; and , however painful to my feelings , I must still dispute your right to cut a stick of the field timber . "
6802	6828	6652	6652	he	193	" That is nonsense , Gordon . I am tenant for life without impeachment of waste , and can cut down all timber not ornamental . "
6829	6919	6652	6652	he	193	" I advise you not , Cousin Peter . I have told you before that I shall try the question at law , should you provoke it , amicably , of course . Rights are rights ; and if I am driven to maintain mine , I trust that you are of a mind too liberal to allow your family affection for me and mine to be influenced by a decree of the Court of Chancery . But my fly is waiting . I must not miss the train . "
6920	6932	6652	6652	he	193	" Well , good - by , Gordon . Shake hands . "
6933	6976	6652	6652	he	193	" Shake hands ! - of course , of course . By the by , as I came through the lodge , it seemed to me sadly out of repair . I believe you are liable for dilapidations . Good - by . "
6977	6986	6988	6989	Sir Peter	421	" The man is a hog in armour , "
6997	7104	6988	6989	Sir Peter	421	" and if it be hard to drive a common pig in the way he do n't choose to go , a hog in armour is indeed undrivable . But his boy ought not to suffer for his father 's hoggishness ; and I shall begin at once to see what I can lay by for him . After all , it is hard upon Gordon . Poor Gordon ; poor fellow ! poor fellow ! Still I hope he will not go to law with me . I hate law . And a worm will turn , especially a worm that is put into Chancery . "
7251	7267	7243	7243	he	909	" Mamma , are you not sometimes overpowered by the sense of your own identity ? "
7308	7327	7301	7301	her	930	" The boy is growing troublesome , too wise for any woman : he must go to school . "
7351	7354	7341	7342	the child	932	" identity , "
7417	7467	7412	7413	Quoth Kenelm	261	" A want is an idea ; and if , as soon as I was born , I felt the want of food and knew at once where to turn for it , without being taught , surely I came into the world with an ' innate idea . ' "
7499	7503	7504	7504	he	421	" My child , "
7509	7559	7504	7504	he	421	" you do n't know what you are talking about : go and take a good gallop on your black pony ; and I forbid you to read any books that are not given to you by myself or your mamma . Stick to ' Puss in Boots . ' "
7796	7799	7801	7802	Sir Peter	421	" Cousin , "
7804	7812	7801	7802	Sir Peter	421	" I have come to consult you . "
7824	7856	7815	7815	he	421	" You see the name begins to work on him rather too much . He must go to school ; and now what school shall it be ? Private or public ? "
7864	8074	7857	7861	THE REV . JOHN STALWORTH	218	" There is a great deal to be said for or against either . At a public school the chances are that Kenelm will no longer be overpowered by a sense of his own identity ; he will more probably lose identity altogether . The worst of a public school is that a sort of common character is substituted for individual character . The master , of course , ca n't attend to the separate development of each boy 's idiosyncrasy . All minds are thrown into one great mould , and come out of it more or less in the same form . An Etonian may be clever or stupid , but , as either , he remains emphatically Etonian . A public school ripens talent , but its tendency is to stifle genius . Then , too , a public school for an only son , heir to a good estate , which will be entirely at his own disposal , is apt to encourage reckless and extravagant habits ; and your estate requires careful management , and leaves no margin for an heir 's notes - of - hand and post - obits . On the whole , I am against a public school for Kenelm . "
8075	8087	7815	7815	he	421	" Well then , we will decide on a private one . "
8088	8091	8093	8094	the Parson	908	" Hold ! "
8096	8201	8093	8094	the Parson	908	" a private school has its drawbacks . You can seldom produce large fishes in small ponds . In private schools the competition is narrowed , the energies stinted . The schoolmaster 's wife interferes , and generally coddles the boys . There is not manliness enough in those academies ; no fagging , and very little fighting . A clever boy turns out a prig ; a boy of feebler intellect turns out a well - behaved young lady in trousers . Nothing muscular in the system . Decidedly the namesake and descendant of Kenelm Digby should not go to a private seminary . "
8202	8212	8214	8215	Sir Peter	421	" So far as I gather from your reasoning , "
8221	8233	8214	8215	Sir Peter	421	" Kenelm Chillingly is not to go to school at all . "
8234	8241	8243	8244	the Parson	908	" It does look like it , "
8248	8431	8243	8244	the Parson	908	" but , on consideration , there is a medium . There are schools which unite the best qualities of public and private schools , large enough to stimulate and develop energies mental and physical , yet not so framed as to melt all character in one crucible . For instance , there is a school which has at this moment one of the first scholars in Europe for head - master , - a school which has turned out some of the most remarkable men of the rising generation . The master sees at a glance if a boy be clever , and takes pains with him accordingly . He is not a mere teacher of hexameters and sapphics . His learning embraces all literature , ancient and modern . He is a good writer and a fine critic ; admires Wordsworth . He winks at fighting : his boys know how to use their fists ; and they are not in the habit of signing post - obits before they are fifteen . Merton School is the place for Kenelm . "
8432	8436	8438	8439	Sir Peter	421	" Thank you , "
8441	8476	8438	8439	Sir Peter	421	" It is a great comfort in life to find somebody who can decide for one . I am an irresolute man myself , and in ordinary matters willingly let Lady Chillingly govern me . "
8477	8488	8490	8492	the stout Parson	938	" I should like to see a wife govern me , "
8494	8518	8438	8439	Sir Peter	421	" But you are not married to Lady Chillingly . And now let us go into the garden and look at your dahlias . "
8630	8657	8623	8623	Kenelm	261	" Sir , I am disgraced , and I shall die of it if you can not help to set me right in my own eyes . "
8658	8675	8693	8693	he	908	" My dear boy , do n't talk in that way . Come into my study . "
8732	8752	8727	8728	the Parson	908	" Hold up your head , Kenelm . I am sure you have done nothing unworthy of a gentleman . "
8753	8872	8693	8693	he	908	" I do n't know that . I fought a boy very little bigger than myself , and I have been licked . I did not give in , though ; but the other boys picked me up , for I could not stand any longer ; and the fellow is a great bully ; and his name is Butt ; and he 's the son of a lawyer ; and he got my head into chancery ; and I have challenged him to fight again next half ; and unless you can help me to lick him , I shall never be good for anything in the world , - never . It will break my heart . "
8873	8988	8727	8728	the Parson	908	" I am very glad to hear you have had the pluck to challenge him . Just let me see how you double your fist . Well , that 's not amiss . Now , put yourself into a fighting attitude , and hit out at me , - hard ! harder ! Pooh ! that will never do . You should make your blows as straight as an arrow . And that 's not the way to stand . Stop , - so : well on your haunches ; weight on the left leg ; good ! Now , put on these gloves , and I 'll give you a lesson in boxing . "
9065	9070	9072	9074	Mrs. John Chillingly	256	" Good gracious me ! "
9135	9150	9129	9129	his	261	" We 'll begin again to - morrow . Now , come to breakfast . "
9187	9223	9177	9177	he	261	" I have been thinking , sir , that perhaps it is not fair to Butt that I should be taking these lessons ; and if it is not fair , I 'd rather not - "
9224	9233	9235	9236	the Parson	908	" Give me your hand , my boy ! "
9240	9327	9235	9236	the Parson	908	" The name of Kenelm is not thrown away upon you . The natural desire of man in his attribute of fighting animal an attribute in which , I believe , he excels all other animated beings , except a quail and a gamecock is to beat his adversary . But the natural desire of that culmination of man which we call gentleman is to beat his adversary fairly . A gentleman would rather be beaten fairly than beat unfairly . Is not that your thought ? "
9328	9331	9333	9333	Kenelm	261	" Yes , "
9347	9371	9344	9344	he	261	" And it stands to reason ; because if I beat a fellow unfairly , I do n't really beat him at all . "
9372	9426	9344	9344	he	261	" Excellent ! But suppose that you and another boy go into examination upon Caesar 's Commentaries or the multiplication table , and the other boy is cleverer than you , but you have taken the trouble to learn the subject and he has not : should you say you beat him unfairly ? "
9437	9440	9427	9427	Kenelm	261	" No . "
9441	9465	9344	9344	he	261	" That which applies to the use of your brains applies equally to the use of your fists . Do you comprehend me ? "
9466	9475	9427	9427	Kenelm	261	" Yes , sir ; I do now . "
9476	9608	9344	9344	he	261	" In the time of your namesake , Sir Kenelm Digby , gentlemen wore swords , and they learned how to use them , because , in case of quarrel , they had to fight with them . Nobody , at least in England , fights with swords now . It is a democratic age , and if you fight at all , you are reduced to fists ; and if Kenelm Digby learned to fence , so Kenelm Chillingly must learn to box ; and if a gentleman thrashes a drayman twice his size , who has not learned to box , it is not unfair ; it is but an exemplification of the truth that knowledge is power . Come and take another lesson on boxing to - morrow . "
9632	9635	9637	9637	Kenelm	261	" Papa , "
9639	9683	9637	9637	Kenelm	261	" how does one gentleman write to another with whom he has a quarrel , and he do n't want to make it up , but he has something to say about the quarrel which it is fair the other gentleman should know ? "
9684	9693	9344	9344	he	261	" I do n't understand what you mean . "
9694	9757	9637	9637	Kenelm	261	" Well , just before I went to school I remember hearing you say that you had a quarrel with Lord Hautfort , and that he was an ass , and you would write and tell him so . When you wrote did you say , ' You are an ass ' ? Is that the way one gentleman writes to another ? "
9758	9909	9344	9344	he	261	" Upon my honour , Kenelm , you ask very odd questions . But you can not learn too early this fact , that irony is to the high - bred what Billingsgate is to the vulgar ; and when one gentleman thinks another gentleman an ass , he does not say it point - blank : he implies it in the politest terms he can invent . Lord Hautfort denies my right of free warren over a trout - stream that runs through his lands . I do n't care a rush about the trout - stream , but there is no doubt of my right to fish in it . He was an ass to raise the question ; for , if he had not , I should not have exercised the right . As he did raise the question , I was obliged to catch his trout . "
9910	9919	9637	9637	Kenelm	261	" And you wrote a letter to him ? "
9920	9923	9344	9344	he	261	" Yes . "
9924	9937	9637	9637	Kenelm	261	" How did you write , Papa ? What did you say ? "
9938	10009	9344	9344	he	261	" Something like this . ' Sir Peter Chillingly presents his compliments to Lord Hautfort , and thinks it fair to his lordship to say that he has taken the best legal advice with regard to his rights of free warren ; and trusts to be forgiven if he presumes to suggest that Lord Hautfort might do well to consult his own lawyer before he decides on disputing them . ' "
10010	10019	9637	9637	Kenelm	261	" Thank you , Papa . I see . "
10083	10086	10088	10088	Kenelm	261	" Papa , "
10093	10129	10088	10088	Kenelm	261	" I want to write to a schoolfellow whose name is Butt ; he is the son of a lawyer who is called a serjeant . I do n't know where to direct to him . "
10130	10136	10138	10139	Sir Peter	421	" That is easily ascertained , "
10141	10159	10138	10139	Sir Peter	421	" Serjeant Butt is an eminent man , and his address will be in the Court Guide . "
10343	10345	10339	10340	Sir Peter	421	" confidential "

10989	10993	10995	10995	he	196	" I mean , "
10997	11038	10995	10995	he	196	" to remain thirty - five all my life . No better age to stick at . People may choose to say I am more , but I shall not own it . No one is bound to criminate himself . "
11053	11127	11050	11050	One	1023	" Refuse to be ill . Never tell people you are ill ; never own it to yourself . Illness is one of those things which a man should resist on principle at the onset . It should never be allowed to get in the thin end of the wedge . But take care of your constitution , and , having ascertained the best habits for it , keep to them like clockwork . "
11171	11294	11168	11168	his	196	" If you want to keep young , live in a metropolis ; never stay above a few weeks at a time in the country . Take two men of similar constitution at the age of twenty - five ; let one live in London and enjoy a regular sort of club life ; send the other to some rural district , preposterously called ' salubrious . ' Look at these men when they have both reached the age of forty - five . The London man has preserved his figure : the rural man has a paunch . The London man has an interesting delicacy of complexion : the face of the rural man is coarse - grained and perhaps jowly . "
11300	11398	11401	11401	his	1027	" Do n't be a family man ; nothing ages one like matrimonial felicity and paternal ties . Never multiply cares , and pack up your life in the briefest compass you can . Why add to your carpet - bag of troubles the contents of a lady 's imperials and bonnet - boxes , and the travelling fourgon required by the nursery ? Shun ambition : it is so gouty . It takes a great deal out of a man 's life , and gives him nothing worth having till he has ceased to enjoy it . "
11406	11446	11401	11401	his	1027	" A fresh mind keeps the body fresh . Take in the ideas of the day , drain off those of yesterday . As to the morrow , time enough to consider it when it becomes to - day . "
11542	11546	11547	11547	he	196	" There are , "
11550	11591	11547	11547	he	196	" two things in life that a sage must preserve at every sacrifice , the coats of his stomach and the enamel of his teeth . Some evils admit of consolations : there are no comforters for dyspepsia and toothache . "
11804	11833	11800	11801	SIR PETER	421	" Cousin Mivers , you have now had time to study Kenelm , and to compare his character with that assigned to him in the Doctor 's letter . "
11838	11841	11834	11834	MIVERS	196	" Ay . "
11846	11925	11842	11843	SIR PETER	421	" I ask you , as a man of the world , what you think I had best do with the boy . Shall I send him to such a tutor as the Doctor suggests ? Cousin John is not of the same mind as the Doctor , and thinks that Kenelm 's oddities are fine things in their way , and should not be prematurely ground out of him by contact with worldly tutors and London pavements . "
11926	11929	11931	11932	Mr. Mivers	196	" Ay , "
11944	11953	11941	11941	he	196	" Parson John , let us hear you . "
12002	12009	11991	11991	he	253	" At the morning of life - "
12038	12049	11991	11991	he	253	" At the morning of life , when the dews - "
12050	12058	12060	12060	Mivers	196	" I knew the dews were coming , "
12062	12107	12060	12060	Mivers	196	" Dry them , if you please ; nothing so unwholesome . We anticipate what you mean to say , which is plainly this , When a fellow is sixteen he is very fresh : so he is ; pass on ; what then ? "
12108	12120	12122	12123	the Parson	908	" If you mean to interrupt me with your habitual cynicism , "
12125	12134	12122	12123	the Parson	908	" why did you ask to hear me ? "
12135	12167	11991	11991	he	253	" That was a mistake I grant ; but who on earth could conceive that you were going to commence in that florid style ? Morning of life indeed ! bosh ! "
12168	12172	12174	12175	Sir Peter	421	" Cousin Mivers , "
12177	12229	12174	12175	Sir Peter	421	" you are not reviewing John 's style in ' The Londoner ; ' and I will beg you to remember that my son 's morning of life is a serious thing to his father , and not to be nipped in its bud by a cousin . Proceed , John ! "
12238	12473	12231	12232	the Parson	908	" I will adapt my style to the taste of my critic . When a fellow is at the age of sixteen , and very fresh to life , the question is whether he should begin thus prematurely to exchange the ideas that belong to youth for the ideas that properly belong to middle age , - whether he should begin to acquire that knowledge of the world which middle - aged men have acquired and can teach . I think not . I would rather have him yet a while in the company of the poets ; in the indulgence of glorious hopes and beautiful dreams , forming to himself some type of the Heroic , which he will keep before his eyes as a standard when he goes into the world as man . There are two schools of thought for the formation of character , - the Real and the Ideal . I would form the character in the Ideal school , in order to make it bolder and grander and lovelier when it takes its place in that every - day life which is called Real . And therefore I am not for placing the descendant of Sir Kenelm Digby , in the interval between school and college , with a man of the world , probably as cynical as Cousin Mivers and living in the stony thoroughfares of London . "
12481	12693	12478	12478	himself	196	" Before we plunge into that Serbonian bog - the controversy between the Realistic and the Idealistic academicians - I think the first thing to decide is what you want Kenelm to be hereafter . When I order a pair of shoes , I decide beforehand what kind of shoes they are to be , - court pumps or strong walking shoes ; and I do n't ask the shoemaker to give me a preliminary lecture upon the different purposes of locomotion to which leather can be applied . If , Sir Peter , you want Kenelm to scribble lackadaisical poems , listen to Parson John ; if you want to fill his head with pastoral rubbish about innocent love , which may end in marrying the miller 's daughter , listen to Parson John ; if you want him to enter life a soft - headed greenhorn , who will sign any bill carrying 50 per cent to which a young scamp asks him to be security , listen to Parson John ; in fine , if you wish a clever lad to become either a pigeon or a ring - dove , a credulous booby or a sentimental milksop , Parson John is the best adviser you can have . "
12694	12713	12760	12761	Mr. Mivers	196	" But I do n't want my son to ripen into either of those imbecile developments of species . "
12714	12732	12478	12478	himself	196	" Then do n't listen to Parson John ; and there 's an end of the discussion . "
12733	12759	12760	12761	Mr. Mivers	196	" No , there is not . I have not heard your advice what to do if John 's advice is not to be taken . "
12768	12773	12775	12776	the Parson	908	" The fact is , "
12778	12819	12775	12776	the Parson	908	" that Mivers got up ' The Londoner ' upon a principle that regulates his own mind , - find fault with the way everything is done , but never commit yourself by saying how anything can be done better . "
12820	12825	12827	12827	Mivers	196	" That is true , "
12831	12971	12827	12827	Mivers	196	" The destructive order of mind is seldom allied to the constructive . I and ' The Londoner ' are destructive by nature and by policy . We can reduce a building into rubbish , but we do n't profess to turn rubbish into a building . We are critics , and , as you say , not such fools as to commit ourselves to the proposition of amendments that can be criticised by others . Nevertheless , for your sake , Cousin Peter , and on the condition that if I give my advice you will never say that I gave it , and if you take it that you will never reproach me if it turns out , as most advice does , very ill , - I will depart from my custom and hazard my opinion . "
12972	12978	12478	12478	himself	196	" I accept the conditions . "
12979	13385	12827	12827	Mivers	196	" Well then , with every new generation there springs up a new order of ideas . The earlier the age at which a man seizes the ideas that will influence his own generation , the more he has a start in the race with his contemporaries . If Kenelm comprehends at sixteen those intellectual signs of the time which , when he goes up to college , he will find young men of eighteen or twenty only just prepared to comprehend , he will produce a deep impression of his powers for reasoning and their adaptation to actual life , which will be of great service to him later . Now the ideas that influence the mass of the rising generation never have their well - head in the generation itself . They have their source in the generation before them , generally in a small minority , neglected or contemned by the great majority which adopt them later . Therefore a lad at the age of sixteen , if he wants to get at such ideas , must come into close contact with some superior mind in which they were conceived twenty or thirty years before . I am consequently for placing Kenelm with a person from whom the new ideas can be learned . I am also for his being placed in the metropolis during the process of this initiation . With such introductions as are at our command , he may come in contact not only with new ideas , but with eminent men in all vocations . It is a great thing to mix betimes with clever people . One picks their brains unconsciously . There is another advantage , and not a small one , in this early entrance into good society . A youth learns manners , self - possession , readiness of resource ; and he is much less likely to get into scrapes and contract tastes for low vices and mean dissipation , when he comes into life wholly his own master , after having acquired a predilection for refined companionship under the guidance of those competent to select it . There , I have talked myself out of breath . And you had better decide at once in favour of my advice ; for as I am of a contradictory temperament , myself of to - morrow may probably contradict myself of to - day . "
13419	13440	13415	13415	he	908	" In this programme of education for a Christian gentleman , the part of Christian seems to me left out . "
13441	13448	13450	13451	Mr. Mivers	196	" The tendency of the age , "
13455	13521	13450	13451	Mr. Mivers	196	" is towards that omission . Secular education is the necessary reaction from the special theological training which arose in the dislike of one set of Christians to the teaching of another set ; and as these antagonists will not agree how religion is to be taught , either there must be no teaching at all , or religion must be eliminated from the tuition . "
13522	13536	13538	13539	Sir Peter	421	" That may do very well for some huge system of national education , "
13541	13579	13538	13539	Sir Peter	421	" but it does not apply to Kenelm , as one of a family all of whose members belong to the Established Church . He may be taught the creed of his forefathers without offending a Dissenter . "
13580	13590	13592	13593	Mr. Mivers	196	" Which Established Church is he to belong to ? "
13596	13624	13592	13593	Mr. Mivers	196	" High Church , Low Church , Broad Church , Puseyite Church , Ritualistic Church , or any other Established Church that may be coming into fashion ? "
13625	13628	13630	13631	the Parson	908	" Pshaw ! "
13633	13711	13713	13714	the Parson	908	" That sneer is out of place . You know very well that one merit of our Church is the spirit of toleration , which does not magnify every variety of opinion into a heresy or a schism . But if Sir Peter sends his son at the age of sixteen to a tutor who eliminates the religion of Christianity from his teaching , he deserves to be thrashed within an inch of his life ; and , "
13728	13736	13713	13714	the Parson	908	" I should like to thrash him . "
13737	13742	13744	13745	Sir Peter	421	" Gently , John , "
13749	13805	13744	13745	Sir Peter	421	" gently , my dear kinsman . My heir shall not be educated as a heathen , and Mivers is only bantering us . Come , Mivers , do you happen to know among your London friends some man who , though a scholar and a man of the world , is still a Christian ? "
13806	13814	13713	13714	the Parson	908	" A Christian as by law established ? "
13815	13820	13744	13745	Sir Peter	421	" Well - yes . "
13821	13831	13713	13714	the Parson	908	" And who will receive Kenelm as a pupil ? "
13832	13849	13744	13745	Sir Peter	421	" Of course I am not putting , such questions to you out of idle curiosity . "
13850	14080	13713	13714	the Parson	908	" I know exactly the man . He was originally intended for orders , and is a very learned theologian . He relinquished the thought of the clerical profession on succeeding to a small landed estate by the sudden death of an elder brother . He then came to London and bought experience : that is , he was naturally generous ; he became easily taken in ; got into difficulties ; the estate was transferred to trustees for the benefit of creditors , and on the payment of L400 a year to himself . By this time he was married and had two children . He found the necessity of employing his pen in order to add to his income , and is one of the ablest contributors to the periodical press . He is an elegant scholar , an effective writer , much courted by public men , a thorough gentleman , has a pleasant house , and receives the best society . Having been once taken in , he defies any one to take him in again . His experience was not bought too dearly . No more acute and accomplished man of the world . The three hundred a year or so that you would pay for Kenelm would suit him very well . His name is Welby , and he lives in Chester Square . "
14081	14094	14096	14097	the Parson	908	" No doubt he is a contributor to ' The Londoner , ' "
14101	14141	14096	14097	the Parson	908	" True . He writes our classical , theological , and metaphysical articles . Suppose I invite him to come here for a day or two , and you can see him and judge for yourself , Sir Peter ? "
14142	14145	13713	13714	the Parson	908	" Do . "
15291	15295	15257	15257	he	261	" memento mori . "
15303	15307	15299	15299	his	261	" take in . "
15849	15856	15900	15901	a logician	1116	" The Approach to the Angels , "
16273	16279	16280	16280	he	261	" It is certainly true , "
16283	16395	16280	16280	he	261	" that the Chillinglys have lived in this place from father to son for about a fourth part of the history of the world , since the date which Sir Isaac Newton assigns to the Deluge . But , so far as can be judged by existent records , the world has not been in any way wiser or better for their existence . They were born to eat as long as they could eat , and when they could eat no longer they died . Not that in this respect they were a whit less insignificant than the generality of their fellow - creatures . Most of us now present , "
16401	16445	16397	16399	the youthful orator	1137	" are only born in order to die ; and the chief consolation of our wounded pride in admitting this fact is in the probability that our posterity will not be of more consequence to the scheme of Nature than we ourselves are . "
16485	16489	16490	16490	he	1137	" As man , "
16493	16779	16490	16490	he	1137	" my father no doubt deserves all that can be said by man in favour of man . But what , at the best , is man ? A crude , struggling , undeveloped embryo , of whom it is the highest attribute that he feels a vague consciousness that he is only an embryo , and can not complete himself till he ceases to be a man ; that is , until he becomes another being in another form of existence . We can praise a dog as a dog , because a dog is a completed ens , and not an embryo . But to praise a man as man , forgetting that he is only a germ out of which a form wholly different is ultimately to spring , is equally opposed to Scriptural belief in his present crudity and imperfection , and to psychological or metaphysical examination of a mental construction evidently designed for purposes that he can never fulfil as man . That my father is an embryo not more incomplete than any present is quite true ; but that , you will see on reflection , is saying very little on his behalf . Even in the boasted physical formation of us men , you are aware that the best - shaped amongst us , according to the last scientific discoveries , is only a development of some hideous hairy animal , such as a gorilla ; and the ancestral gorilla itself had its own aboriginal forefather in a small marine animal shaped like a two - necked bottle . The probability is that , some day or other , we shall be exterminated by a new development of species .
16780	17236	17245	17246	the orator	1143	" As for the merits assigned to my father as landlord , I must respectfully dissent from the panegyrics so rashly bestowed on him . For all sound reasoners must concur in this , that the first duty of an owner of land is not to the occupiers to whom he leases it , but to the nation at large . It is his duty to see that the land yields to the community the utmost it can yield . In order to effect this object , a landlord should put up his farms to competition , exacting the highest rent he can possibly get from responsible competitors . Competitive examination is the enlightened order of the day , even in professions in which the best men would have qualities that defy examination . In agriculture , happily , the principle of competitive examination is not so hostile to the choice of the best man as it must be , for instance , in diplomacy , where a Talleyrand would be excluded for knowing no language but his own ; and still more in the army , where promotion would be denied to an officer who , like Marlborough , could not spell . But in agriculture a landlord has only to inquire who can give the highest rent , having the largest capital , subject by the strictest penalties of law to the conditions of a lease dictated by the most scientific agriculturists under penalties fixed by the most cautious conveyancers . By this mode of procedure , recommended by the most liberal economists of our age , - barring those still more liberal who deny that property in land is any property at all , - by this mode of procedure , I say , a landlord does his duty to his country . He secures tenants who can produce the most to the community by their capital , tested through competitive examination in their bankers ' accounts and the security they can give , and through the rigidity of covenants suggested by a Liebig and reduced into law by a Chitty . But on my father 's land I see a great many tenants with little skill and less capital , ignorant of a Liebig and revolting from a Chitty , and no filial enthusiasm can induce me honestly to say that my father is a good landlord . He has preferred his affection for individuals to his duties to the community . It is not , my friends , a question whether a handful of farmers like yourselves go to the workhouse or not . It is a consumer 's question . Do you produce the maximum of corn to the consumer ?
17237	17243	17245	17246	the orator	1143	" With respect to myself , "
17264	17355	17252	17252	he	1143	" with respect to myself , I do not deny that , owing to the accident of training for a very faulty and contracted course of education , I have obtained what are called ' honours ' at the University of Cambridge ; but you must not regard that fact as a promise of any worth in my future passage through life . Some of the most useless persons - especially narrow - minded and bigoted - have acquired far higher honours at the University than have fallen to my lot .
17356	17501	17245	17246	the orator	1143	" I thank you no less for the civil things you have said of me and of my family ; but I shall endeavour to walk to that grave to which we are all bound with a tranquil indifference as to what people may say of me in so short a journey . And the sooner , my friends , we get to our journey 's end , the better our chance of escaping a great many pains , troubles , sins , and diseases . So that when I drink to your good healths , you must feel that in reality I wish you an early deliverance from the ills to which flesh is exposed , and which so generally increase with our years that good health is scarcely compatible with the decaying faculties of old age . Gentlemen , your good healths ! "
17664	17673	17675	17676	Sir Peter	421	" Does fishing amuse you , my boy ? "
17680	17688	17690	17690	Kenelm	261	" Not in the least , sir , "
17692	17700	17702	17703	Lady Chillingly	1154	" Then why do you do it ? "
17705	17716	17702	17703	Lady Chillingly	1154	" Because I know nothing else that amuses me more . "
17717	17724	17726	17727	Sir Peter	421	" Ah ! that is it , "
17729	17784	17726	17727	Sir Peter	421	" the whole secret of Kenelm 's oddities is to be found in these words , my dear ; he needs amusement . Voltaire says truly , ' Amusement is one of the wants of man . ' And if Kenelm could be amused like other people , he would be like other people . "
17785	17790	17792	17792	Kenelm	261	" In that case , "
17817	17855	17811	17812	Lady Chillingly	282	" in that case I would rather not be amused . I have no interest in the absurdities of other people . The instinct of self - preservation compels me to have some interest in my own . "
17856	17861	17863	17864	Lady Chillingly	1155	" Kenelm , sir , "
17879	17909	17863	17864	Lady Chillingly	1155	" take away that horrid damp thing ! Put down your rod and attend to what your father says . Your strange conduct gives us cause of serious anxiety . "
17935	17947	17924	17924	his	261	" What is there in my conduct that occasions you displeasure ? "
17948	17954	17956	17957	Sir Peter	421	" Not displeasure , Kenelm , "
17961	18078	17956	17957	Sir Peter	421	" but anxiety ; your mother has hit upon the right word . You see , my dear son , that it is my wish that you should distinguish yourself in the world . You might represent this county , as your ancestors have done before . I have looked forward to the proceedings of yesterday as an admirable occasion for your introduction to your future constituents . Oratory is the talent most appreciated in a free country , and why should you not be an orator ? Demosthenes says that delivery , delivery , delivery , is the art of oratory ; and your delivery is excellent , graceful , self - possessed , classical . "
18079	18166	17924	17924	his	261	" Pardon me , my dear father , Demosthenes does not say delivery , nor action , as the word is commonly rendered ; he says , ' acting , or stage - play , ' - the art by which a man delivers a speech in a feigned character , whence we get the word hypocrisy . Hypocrisy , hypocrisy , hypocrisy ! is , according to Demosthenes , the triple art of the orator . Do you wish me to become triply a hypocrite ? "
18167	18292	17956	17957	Sir Peter	421	" Kenelm , I am ashamed of you . You know as well as I do that it is only by metaphor that you can twist the word ascribed to the great Athenian into the sense of hypocrisy . But assuming it , as you say , to mean not delivery , but acting , I understand why your debut as an orator was not successful . Your delivery was excellent , your acting defective . An orator should please , conciliate , persuade , prepossess . You did the reverse of all this ; and though you produced a great effect , the effect was so decidedly to your disadvantage that it would have lost you an election on any hustings in England . "
18293	18303	18305	18305	Kenelm	261	" Am I to understand , my dear father , "
18329	18354	18305	18305	Kenelm	261	" am I to understand that you would commend to your son the adoption of deliberate falsehood for the gain of a selfish advantage ? "
18355	18363	18369	18369	Kenelm	261	" Deliberate falsehood ! you impertinent puppy ! "
18364	18367	18369	18369	Kenelm	261	" Puppy ! "
18377	18390	18369	18369	Kenelm	261	" puppy ! a well - bred puppy takes after its parents . "
18416	18424	18426	18427	Sir Peter	421	" Now , look you , Kenelm , "
18437	18525	18432	18432	he	421	" These quips and humours of yours are amusing enough to an eccentric man like myself , but they will not do for the world ; and how at your age , and with the rare advantages you have had in an early introduction to the best intellectual society , under the guidance of a tutor acquainted with the new ideas which are to influence the conduct of statesmen , you could have made so silly a speech as you did yesterday , I can not understand . "
18526	18595	18369	18369	Kenelm	261	" My dear father , allow me to assure you that the ideas I expressed are the new ideas most in vogue , - ideas expressed in still plainer , or , if you prefer the epithet , still sillier terms than I employed . You will find them instilled into the public mind by ' The Londoner ' and by most intellectual journals of a liberal character . "
18596	18611	18432	18432	he	421	" Kenelm , Kenelm , such ideas would turn the world topsy - turvy . "
18612	18649	18369	18369	Kenelm	261	" New ideas always do tend to turn old ideas topsy - turvy . And the world , after all , is only an idea , which is turned topsy - turvy with every successive century . "
18650	18671	18432	18432	he	421	" You make me sick of the word ' ideas . ' Leave off your metaphysics and study real life . "
18672	18732	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" It is real life which I did study under Mr. Welby . He is the Archimandrite of Realism . It is sham life which you wish me to study . To oblige you I am willing to commence it . I dare say it is very pleasant . Real life is not ; on the contrary - dull , "
18738	18750	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" Have you no young friends among your fellow - collegians ? "
18751	18784	18432	18432	he	421	" Friends ! certainly not , sir . But I believe I have some enemies , who answer the same purpose as friends , only they do n't hurt one so much . "
18785	18798	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" Do you mean to say that you lived alone at Cambridge ? "
18799	18819	18432	18432	he	421	" No , I lived a good deal with Aristophanes , and a little with Conic Sections and Hydrostatics . "
18820	18826	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" Books . Dry company . "
18827	18846	18432	18432	he	421	" More innocent , at least , than moist company . Did you ever get drunk , sir ? "
18847	18850	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" Drunk ! "
18851	18893	18432	18432	he	421	" I tried to do so once with the young companions whom you would commend to me as friends . I do n't think I succeeded , but I woke with a headache . Real life at college abounds with headache . "
18894	18909	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" Kenelm , my boy , one thing is clear : you must travel . "
18910	18941	18432	18432	he	421	" As you please , sir . Marcus Antoninus says that it is all one to a stone whether it be thrown upwards or downwards . When shall I start ? "
18942	18997	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" Very soon . Of course there are preparations to make ; you should have a travelling companion . I do n't mean a tutor , - you are too clever and too steady to need one , - but a pleasant , sensible , well - mannered young person of your own age . "
18998	19008	18432	18432	he	421	" My own age , - male or female ? "
19026	19088	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" FEMALE ! If I said you were too steady to need a tutor , it was because you have hitherto seemed little likely to be led out of your way by female allurements . Among your other studies may I inquire if you have included that which no man has ever yet thoroughly mastered , - the study of women ? "
19089	19101	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" Certainly . Do you object to my catching another trout ? "
19102	19136	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" Trout be - blessed , or the reverse . So you have studied woman . I should never have thought it . Where and when did you commence that department of science ? "
19137	19166	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" When ? ever since I was ten years old . Where ? first in your own house , then at college . Hush ! - a bite , "
19191	19213	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" At ten years old , and in my own house ! That flaunting hussy Jane , the under - housemaid - "
19214	19282	18734	18734	Kenelm	261	" Jane ! No , sir . Pamela , Miss Byron , Clarissa , - females in Richardson , who , according to Dr. Johnson , ' taught the passions to move at the command of virtue . ' I trust for your sake that Dr. Johnson did not err in that assertion , for I found all these females at night in your own private apartments . "
19283	19286	19288	19289	Sir Peter	421	" Oh ! "
19291	19296	19288	19289	Sir Peter	421	" that 's all ? "
19297	19306	19308	19308	Kenelm	261	" All I remember at ten years old , "
19310	19320	19322	19323	Sir Peter	421	" And at Mr. Welby 's or at college , "
19327	19338	19322	19323	Sir Peter	421	" was your acquaintance with females of the same kind ? "
19344	19356	19341	19341	his	261	" Much worse : they were very naughty indeed at college . "
19357	19374	19288	19289	Sir Peter	421	" I should think so , with such a lot of young fellows running after them . "
19375	19391	19341	19341	his	261	" Very few fellows run after the females . I mean - rather avoid them . "
19392	19398	19288	19289	Sir Peter	421	" So much the better . "
19399	19427	19341	19341	his	261	" No , my father , so much the worse ; without an intimate knowledge of those females there is little use going to college at all . "
19428	19432	19288	19289	Sir Peter	421	" Explain yourself . "
19433	19480	19341	19341	his	261	" Every one who receives a classical education is introduced into their society , - Pyrrha and Lydia , Glycera and Corinna , and many more of the same sort ; and then the females in Aristophanes , what do you say to them , sir ? "
19481	19518	19288	19289	Sir Peter	421	" Is it only females who lived two thousand or three thousand years ago , or more probably never lived at all , whose intimacy you have cultivated ? Have you never admired any real women ? "
19519	19585	19341	19341	his	261	" Real women ! I never met one . Never met a woman who was not a sham , a sham from the moment she is told to be pretty - behaved , conceal her sentiments , and look fibs when she does not speak them . But if I am to learn sham life , I suppose I must put up with sham women . "
19586	19602	19288	19289	Sir Peter	421	" Have you been crossed in love that you speak so bitterly of the sex ? "
19603	19644	19341	19341	his	261	" I do n't speak bitterly of the sex . Examine any woman on her oath , and she 'll own she is a sham , always has been , and always will be , and is proud of it . "
19645	19693	19288	19289	Sir Peter	421	" I am glad your mother is not by to hear you . You will think differently one of these days . Meanwhile , to turn to the other sex , is there no young man of your own rank with whom you would like to travel ? "
19694	19702	19341	19341	his	261	" Certainly not . I hate quarrelling . "
19703	19796	19288	19289	Sir Peter	421	" As you please . But you can not go quite alone : I will find you a good travelling - servant . I must write to town to - day about your preparations , and in another week or so I hope all will be ready . Your allowance will be whatever you like to fix it at ; you have never been extravagant , and - boy - I love you . Amuse yourself , enjoy yourself , and come back cured of your oddities , but preserving your honour . "
19832	19858	19812	19812	he	261	" If ever I am tempted to do a base thing , may I remember whose son I am : I shall be safe then . "
20161	20173	20175	20175	Kenelm	261	" It is a wonderful proof of the wisdom of Providence , "
20177	20433	20175	20175	Kenelm	261	" that whenever any large number of its creatures forms a community or class , a secret element of disunion enters into the hearts of the individuals forming the congregation , and prevents their co - operating heartily and effectually for their common interest . ' The fleas would have dragged me out of bed if they had been unanimous , ' said the great Mr. Curran ; and there can be no doubt that if all the spiders in this commonwealth would unite to attack me in a body , I should fall a victim to their combined nippers . But spiders , though inhabiting the same region , constituting the same race , animated by the same instincts , do not combine even against a butterfly : each seeks his own special advantage , and not that of the community at large . And how completely the life of each thing resembles a circle in this respect , that it can never touch another circle at more than one point . Nay , I doubt if it quite touches it even there , - there is a space between every atom ; self is always selfish : and yet there are eminent masters in the Academe of New Ideas who wish to make us believe that all the working classes of a civilized world could merge every difference of race , creed , intellect , individual propensities and interests into the construction of a single web , stocked as a larder in common ! "
20679	20689	20691	20691	Kenelm	261	" ' Alas ! regardless of their doom , ' "
20693	20724	20691	20691	Kenelm	261	" what trouble those ' little victims ' are preparing for themselves and their progeny ! Would I could lend them Decimus Roach 's ' Approach to the Angels ' ! "
20780	20834	20775	20775	They	1211	" Black Karl looked forth from his cottage door , He looked on the forest green ; And down the path , with his dogs before , Came the Ritter of Neirestein : Singing , singing , lustily singing , Down the path with his dogs before , Came the Ritter of Neirestein . "
21159	21184	21135	21135	he	1217	" ' Why on foot , why on foot , Ritter Karl , ' quoth he , ' And not on thy palfrey gray ? '
21192	21214	21135	21135	he	1217	" ' The run of ill - luck was too strong for me , ' And has galloped my steed away . '
21221	21221	21135	21135	he	1217	"
21222	21231	21233	21233	Kenelm	261	" Good indeed ! He is easily satisfied , "
21235	21253	21233	21233	Kenelm	261	" But such pedestrians do n't pass the road every day . Let us talk to him . "
21388	21401	21408	21409	The wayfarer	1220	" I should like to hear the rest of that German ballad , "
21476	21485	21487	21487	Kenelm	261	" I beg your pardon for my interruption , "
21493	21532	21487	21487	Kenelm	261	" but I overheard you reciting ; and though I suppose your verses are a translation from the German , I do n't remember anything like them in such popular German poets as I happen to have read . "
21533	21542	21544	21545	the itinerant	1230	" It is not a translation , sir , "
21547	21566	21544	21545	the itinerant	1230	" I was only trying to string together some ideas that came into my head this fine morning . "
21567	21575	21577	21577	Kenelm	261	" You are a poet , then ? "
21585	21599	21544	21545	the itinerant	1230	" I dare not say poet . I am a verse - maker . "
21600	21662	21544	21545	the itinerant	1230	" Sir , I know there is a distinction . Many poets of the present day , considered very good , are uncommonly bad verse - makers . For my part , I could more readily imagine them to be good poets if they did not make verses at all . But can I not hear the rest of the ballad ? "
21663	21690	21544	21545	the itinerant	1230	" Alas ! the rest of the ballad is not yet made . It is rather a long subject , and my flights are very brief . "
21691	21727	21544	21545	the itinerant	1230	" That is much in their favour , and very unlike the poetry in fashion . You do not belong , I think , to this neighbourhood . Are you and your dog travelling far ? "
21728	21764	21544	21545	the itinerant	1230	" It is my holiday time , and I ramble on through the summer . I am travelling far , for I travel till September . Life amid summer fields is a very joyous thing . "
21765	21770	21772	21772	Kenelm	261	" Is it indeed ? "
21778	21926	21772	21772	Kenelm	261	" I should have thought that long before September you would have got very much bored with the fields and the dog and yourself altogether . But , to be sure , you have the resource of verse - making , and that seems a very pleasant and absorbing occupation to those who practise it , - from our old friend Horace , kneading laboured Alcaics into honey in his summer rambles among the watered woodlands of Tibur , to Cardinal Richelieu , employing himself on French rhymes in the intervals between chopping off noblemen 's heads . It does not seem to signify much whether the verses be good or bad , so far as the pleasure of the verse - maker himself is concerned ; for Richelieu was as much charmed with his occupation as Horace was , and his verses were certainly not Horatian . "
21927	21941	21544	21545	the itinerant	1230	" Surely at your age , sir , and with your evident education - "
21942	21954	21772	21772	Kenelm	261	" Say culture ; that 's the word in fashion nowadays . "
21955	21968	21544	21545	the itinerant	1230	" Well , your evident culture , you must have made verses . "
21969	21994	21772	21772	Kenelm	261	" Latin verses , yes ; and occasionally Greek . I was obliged to do so at school . It did not amuse me . "
21995	21999	21544	21545	the itinerant	1230	" Try English . "
22005	22016	22002	22002	his	261	" Not I. Every cobbler should stick to his last . "
22017	22075	21772	21772	Kenelm	261	" Well , put aside the verse - making : do n't you find a sensible enjoyment in those solitary summer walks , when you have Nature all to yourself , - enjoyment in marking all the mobile evanescent changes in her face , - her laugh , her smile , her tears , her very frown ! "
22076	22194	22002	22002	his	261	" Assuming that by Nature you mean a mechanical series of external phenomena , I object to your speaking of a machinery as if it were a person of the feminine gender , - her laugh , her smile , etc . As well talk of the laugh and smile of a steam - engine . But to descend to common - sense . I grant there is some pleasure in solitary rambles in fine weather and amid varying scenery . You say that it is a holiday excursion that you are enjoying . I presume , therefore , that you have some practical occupation which consumes the time that you do not devote to a holiday ? "
22195	22255	21772	21772	Kenelm	261	" Yes ; I am not altogether an idler . I work sometimes , though not so hard as I ought . ' Life is earnest , ' as the poet says . But I and my dog are rested now , and as I have still a long walk before me I must wish you good - day . "
22256	22260	22262	22262	Kenelm	261	" I fear , "
22299	22342	22344	22344	he	261	" I fear that I have offended you by a question that must have seemed to you inquisitive , perhaps impertinent ; accept my excuse : it is very rarely that I meet any one who interests me ; and you do . "
22358	22467	22346	22346	he	261	" I should be a churl indeed if your question could have given me offence . It is rather perhaps I who am guilty of impertinence , if I take advantage of my seniority in years and tender you a counsel . Do not despise Nature or regard her as a steam - engine ; you will find in her a very agreeable and conversable friend if you will cultivate her intimacy . And I do n't know a better mode of doing so at your age , and with your strong limbs , than putting a knapsack on your shoulders and turning foot - traveller like myself . "
22468	22558	22566	22567	the traveller	1232	" Sir , I thank you for your counsel ; and I trust we may meet again and interchange ideas as to the thing you call Nature , - a thing which science and art never appear to see with the same eyes . If to an artist Nature has a soul , why , so has a steam - engine . Art gifts with soul all matter that it contemplates : science turns all that is already gifted with soul into matter . Good - day , sir . "
22589	22594	22579	22579	KENELM	261	" old hereditary trees . "
22653	22657	22659	22659	Kenelm	261	" It is , "
22662	22838	22659	22659	Kenelm	261	" a strange yearning I have long felt , - to get out of myself , to get , as it were , into another man 's skin , and have a little variety of thought and emotion . One 's self is always the same self ; and that is why I yawn so often . But if I ca n't get into another man 's skin , the next best thing is to get as unlike myself as I possibly can do . Let me see what is myself . Myself is Kenelm Chillingly , son and heir to a rich gentleman . But a fellow with a knapsack on his back , sleeping at wayside inns , is not at all like Kenelm Chillingly ; especially if he is very short of money and may come to want a dinner . Perhaps that sort of fellow may take a livelier view of things : he ca n't take a duller one . Courage , Myself : you and I can but try . "
23601	23605	23591	23591	I	0	" Bless you , "

24152	24195	24129	24129	He	421	" My old friend the Duke of Clareville is just setting off on a tour to Switzerland with his family . His youngest daughter , Lady Jane , is a pretty girl , and would not be a bad match for Kenelm . "
24196	24237	24125	24127	a practised fibber	1301	" Lady Jane , the youngest daughter with fair hair , whom I saw last as a very charming child , nursing a lovely doll presented to her by the Empress Eugenie , - a good match indeed for Kenelm . "
24238	24282	24129	24129	He	421	" I am glad you agree with me . Would it not be a favourable step towards that alliance , and an excellent thing for Kenelm generally , if he were to visit the Continent as one of the Duke 's travelling party ? "
24283	24289	24125	24127	a practised fibber	1301	" Of course it would . "
24290	24394	24129	24129	He	421	" Then you approve what I have done ; the Duke starts the day after to - morrow , and I have packed Kenelm off to town , with a letter to my old friend . You will excuse all leave taking . You know that though the best of sons he is an odd fellow ; and seeing that I had talked him into it , I struck while the iron was hot , and sent him off by the express at nine o'clock this morning , for fear that if I allowed any delay he would talk himself out of it . "
24395	24409	24410	24411	Sir Peter	421	" Do you mean to say Kenelm is actually gone ? Good gracious . "
24425	24460	24410	24411	Sir Peter	421	" I have sent Mr. Chillingly to London . Pack up the clothes he is likely to want , so that he can have them sent at once , whenever he writes for them . "

24555	24690	24544	24544	he	261	" unquestionably I begin the world as poets begin poetry , an imitator and a plagiarist . I am imitating an itinerant verse - maker , as , no doubt , he began by imitating some other maker of verse . But if there be anything in me , it will work itself out in original form . And , after all , the verse - maker is not the inventor of ideas . Adventure on foot is a notion that remounts to the age of fable . Hercules , for instance ; that was the way in which he got to heaven , as a foot - traveller . How solitary the world is at this hour ! Is it not for that reason that this is of all hours the most beautiful ? "
25095	25102	25103	25103	He	261	" Refreshment for man and beast . "
25215	25218	25220	25220	Kenelm	261	" Now , "
25222	25364	25220	25220	Kenelm	261	" I really begin to think I have got out of myself . I am in another man 's skin ; for what , after all , is a skin but a soul 's clothing , and what is clothing but a decenter skin ? Of its own natural skin every civilized soul is ashamed . It is the height of impropriety for any one but the lowest kind of savage to show it . If the purest soul now existent upon earth , the Pope of Rome 's or the Archbishop of Canterbury 's , were to pass down the Strand with the skin which Nature gave to it bare to the eye , it would be brought up before a magistrate , prosecuted by the Society for the Suppression of Vice , and committed to jail as a public nuisance .
25365	25381	25220	25220	Kenelm	261	" Decidedly I am now in another man 's skin . Kenelm Chillingly , I no longer
25382	25383	25220	25220	Kenelm	261	" Remain
25384	25387	25220	25220	Kenelm	261	" Yours faithfully ;
25388	25391	25220	25220	Kenelm	261	" But am ,
25392	25396	25220	25220	Kenelm	261	" With profound consideration ,
25397	25403	25220	25220	Kenelm	261	" Your obedient humble servant . "
25453	25471	25220	25220	Kenelm	261	" Help ! help ! I will not go ; I tell you , I will not ! "
25530	25535	25561	25562	the cob	1334	" Help , help ! "
25636	25653	25620	25620	He	261	" For shame ! what are you doing to that poor boy ? let him go ! "
25654	25662	25664	25666	the stout man	1340	" Why the devil do you interfere ? "
25678	25702	25664	25666	the stout man	1340	" Ah , are you the villain ? yes , no doubt of it . I 'll give it to you , jackanapes , "
25820	25835	25796	25797	The boy	5573	" Come , come before he gets up ! save me ! save me ! "
25862	25886	25844	25845	the boy	5573	" Get in , get in , I ca n't drive ; get in , and drive - you . Quick ! Quick ! "
25887	25890	25892	25892	Kenelm	261	" But - "
25894	25904	25905	25905	Kenelm	261	" Get in , or I shall go mad . "
25933	25954	25930	25931	the cob	1334	" Stop , stop , stop , thief ! villain ! Holloa ! thieves ! thieves ! thieves ! stop ! "
26041	26045	26048	26048	Kenelm	261	" Young gentleman , "
26050	26060	26048	26048	Kenelm	261	" perhaps you will have the goodness to explain . "
26061	26087	26315	26316	The boy	5573	" By and by ; get on , that 's a good fellow ; you shall be well paid for it , well and handsomely . "
26093	26154	26088	26089	Quoth Kenelm	261	" I know that in real life payment and service naturally go together . But we will put aside the payment till you tell me what is to be the service . And first , whither am I to drive you ? We are coming to a place where three roads meet ; which of the three shall I take ? "
26155	26194	26048	26048	Kenelm	261	" Oh , I do n't know ; there is a finger - post . I want to get to , - but it is a secret ; you 'll not betray me ? Promise , - swear . "
26195	26268	26088	26089	Quoth Kenelm	261	" I do n't swear except when I am in a passion , which , I am sorry to say , is very seldom ; and I do n't promise till I know what I promise ; neither do I go on driving runaway boys in other men 's gigs unless I know that I am taking them to a safe place , where their papas and mammas can get at them . "
26269	26278	26280	26281	the boy	5573	" I have no papa , no mamma , "
26289	26314	26088	26089	Quoth Kenelm	261	" Poor boy ! I suppose that burly brute is your schoolmaster , and you are running away home for fear of a flogging . "
26335	26356	26332	26332	Kenelm	261	" No , he would not flog me : he is not a schoolmaster ; he is worse than that . "
26357	26366	26088	26089	Quoth Kenelm	261	" Is it possible ? What is he ? "
26367	26371	26332	26332	Kenelm	261	" An uncle . "
26372	26400	26088	26089	Quoth Kenelm	261	" Hum ! uncles are proverbial for cruelty ; were so in the classical days , and Richard III . was the only scholar in his family . "
26401	26410	26412	26413	the boy	5573	" Eh ! classical and Richard III . ! "
26425	26436	26412	26413	the boy	5573	" Who are you ? you talk like a gentleman . "
26437	26454	26088	26089	Quoth Kenelm	261	" I beg pardon . I 'll not do so again if I can help it . "
26456	26459	26461	26461	Kenelm	261	" Decidedly , "
26463	26491	26461	26461	Kenelm	261	" I am beginning to be amused . What a blessing it is to get into another man 's skin , and another man 's gig too ! "
26494	26523	26461	26461	Kenelm	261	" Here we are at the fingerpost . If you are running away from your uncle , it is time to inform me where you are running to . "
26543	26571	26412	26413	the boy	5573	" All right ! I thought so , ' To Tor - Hadham , eighteen miles . ' That 's the road to ' Tor - Hadham . "
26572	26591	26708	26708	Kenelm	261	" Do you mean to say I am to drive you all that way , - eighteen miles ? "
26592	26595	26412	26413	the boy	5573	" Yes . "
26596	26604	26708	26708	Kenelm	261	" And to whom are you going ? "
26605	26698	26412	26413	the boy	5573	" I will tell you by and by . Do go on ; do , pray . I ca n't drive - never drove in my life - or I would not ask you . Pray , pray , do n't desert me ! If you are a gentleman you will not ; and if you are not a gentleman , I have got L10 in my purse , which you shall have when I am safe at Tor - Hadham . Do n't hesitate : my whole life is at stake ! "
26726	26735	26737	26738	the boy	5573	" You are a good , dear fellow , "
26744	26759	26737	26738	the boy	5573	" I am afraid I am taking you very much out of your road . "
26760	26800	26708	26708	Kenelm	261	" I have no road in particular , and would as soon go to Tor - Hadham , which I have never seen , as anywhere else . I am but a wanderer on the face of the earth . "
26801	26822	26737	26738	the boy	5573	" Have you lost your papa and mamma too ? Why , you are not much older than I am . "
26823	26827	26829	26829	Kenelm	261	" Little gentleman , "
26833	26850	26829	26829	Kenelm	261	" I am just of age , and you , I suppose , are about fourteen . "
26851	26855	26857	26858	the boy	5573	" What fun ! "
26862	26868	26857	26858	the boy	5573	" Is n't it fun ? "
26869	26941	26737	26738	the boy	5573	" It will not be fun if I am sentenced to penal servitude for stealing your uncle 's gig , and robbing his little nephew of L10 . By the by , that choleric relation of yours meant to knock down somebody else when he struck at me . He asked , ' Are you the villain ? ' Pray who is the villain ? he is evidently in your confidence . "
26942	26981	26857	26858	the boy	5573	" Villain ! he is the most honourable , high - minded - But no matter now : I 'll introduce you to him when we reach Tor - Hadham . Whip that pony : he is crawling . "
26982	26995	26737	26738	the boy	5573	" It is up hill : a good man spares his beast . "
27165	27168	27169	27169	he	261	" row ! "
27176	27178	27169	27169	he	261	" row "
27582	27592	27574	27574	Kenelm	261	" My boy , I must talk with you ; "
27609	27616	27595	27596	the boy	5573	" Hush ! I am thinking . "
27638	27644	27646	27646	Kenelm	261	" NOW , young sir , "
27657	27684	27646	27646	Kenelm	261	" now we are in the town , where am I to take you ? and wherever it be , there to say good - by . "
27685	27712	27714	27715	the boy	5573	" No , not good - by . Stay with me a little bit . I begin to feel frightened , and I am so friendless ; "
27812	27851	27800	27800	he	261	" Little brute that you are , I 'll be shot if I forsake you if in trouble . But some compassion is also due to the cob : for his sake say where we are to stop . "
27852	27886	27795	27795	He	261	" I am sure I ca n't say : I never was here before . Let us go to a nice quiet inn . Drive slowly : we 'll look out for one . "
28141	28152	28135	28135	he	5573	" Ah , I was right : there it is ! "
28153	28158	28160	28160	Kenelm	261	" There what is ? "
28163	28167	28160	28160	Kenelm	261	" the inn ? "
28188	28195	28160	28160	Kenelm	261	" TO - MORROW NIGHT THEATRE OPENS .
28196	28203	28160	28160	Kenelm	261	" RICHARD III . Mr. COMPTON . "
28204	28213	28215	28216	the boy	5573	" Do just ask where the theatre is , "
28310	28313	28315	28315	he	5573	" Now , "
28317	28332	28315	28315	he	5573	" let us look out for an inn near here , - the nearest . "
28394	28398	28448	28449	the cob	1334	" Temperance Hotel . "
28399	28402	28404	28405	the boy	5573	" Stop , "
28407	28421	28404	28405	the boy	5573	" do n't you think that would suit us ? it looks quiet . "
28422	28434	28436	28436	Kenelm	261	" Could not look more quiet if it were a tombstone , "
28560	28563	28552	28554	This tidy woman	1449	" pleasure . "
28564	28567	28572	28572	his	261	" Pleasure , "
28576	28622	28572	28572	his	261	" is not the word I should myself have chosen . But could you oblige my horse - I mean that horse - with a stall and a feed of oats , and that young gentleman and myself with a private room and a dinner ? "
28623	28626	28628	28629	the hostess	1450	" Dinner ! "
28632	28635	28628	28629	the hostess	1450	" dinner ! "
28636	28667	28572	28572	his	261	" A thousand pardons , ma'am . But if the word ' dinner ' shock you I retract it , and would say instead something to eat and drink . ' "
28668	28680	28628	28629	the hostess	1450	" Drink ! This is strictly a Temperance Hotel , sir . "
28681	28693	28695	28695	Kenelm	261	" Oh , if you do n't eat and drink here , "
28704	28711	28695	28695	Kenelm	261	" I wish you good morning . "
28712	28739	28628	28629	the hostess	1450	" Stay a bit , sir . We do eat and drink here . But we are very simple folks . We allow no fermented liquors . "
28740	28748	28695	28695	Kenelm	261	" Not even a glass of beer ? "
28749	28792	28628	28629	the hostess	1450	" Only ginger - beer . Alcohols are strictly forbidden . We have tea and coffee and milk . But most of our customers prefer the pure liquid . As for eating , sir , - anything you order , in reason . "
28819	28861	28802	28803	the boy	5573	" What does it signify ? Who wants fermented liquors ? Water will do very well . And as for dinner , - anything convenient . Please , ma'am , show us into a private room : I am so tired . "
28888	28892	28882	28882	her	1450	" Poor boy ! "
28902	28910	28882	28882	her	1450	" What a pretty face he has ! "
28926	28939	28941	28941	Kenelm	261	" But the horse and gig , where are they to go ? "
28961	29013	28882	28882	her	1450	" Oh , as for the horse and gig , sir , you will find Jukes 's livery - stables a few yards farther down . We do n't take in horses ourselves ; our customers seldom keep them : but you will find the best of accommodation at Jukes 's . "
29251	29262	29264	29264	Kenelm	261	" What are they going to give us to eat ? "
29266	29278	29264	29264	Kenelm	261	" It must be ready by this time I should think . "
29430	29446	29424	29424	his	1470	" Sir , you have behaved extremely well , and I thank you very much . "
29447	29457	29459	29460	Kenelm Chillingly	261	" Your Royal Highness is condescending to say so , "
29465	29504	29459	29460	Kenelm Chillingly	261	" but have you ordered dinner ? and what are they going to give us ? No one seems to answer the bell here . As it is a Temperance Hotel , probably all the servants are drunk . "
29505	29516	29424	29424	his	1470	" Why should they be drunk at a Temperance Hotel ? "
29517	29718	29459	29460	Kenelm Chillingly	261	" Why ! because , as a general rule , people who flagrantly pretend to anything are the reverse of that which they pretend to . A man who sets up for a saint is sure to be a sinner , and a man who boasts that he is a sinner is sure to have some feeble , maudlin , snivelling bit of saintship about him which is enough to make him a humbug . Masculine honesty , whether it be saint - like or sinner - like , does not label itself either saint or sinner . Fancy Saint Augustine labelling himself saint , or Robert Burns sinner ; and therefore , though , little boy , you have probably not read the poems of Robert Burns , and have certainly not read the ' Confessions ' of Saint Augustine , take my word for it , that both those personages were very good fellows ; and with a little difference of training and experience , Burns might have written the ' Confessions ' and Augustine the poems . Powers above ! I am starving . What did you order for dinner , and when is it to appear ? "
29768	29818	29754	29755	Saint Augustine	319	" I am sorry I was not thinking of dinner . I was not so mindful of you as I ought to have been . The landlady asked me what we would have . I said , ' What you like ; ' and the landlady muttered something about - "
29824	29834	29890	29890	his	1472	" Yes . About what ? Mutton - chops ? "
29835	29844	29890	29890	his	1472	" No . Cauliflowers and rice - pudding . "
29899	29905	29888	29888	He	1472	" Cauliflower ! - Starvation ! "
29927	29927	29888	29888	He	1472	"
29957	29976	29953	29953	he	5573	" Pray forgive me , I was ungrateful . I 'll run down and see what there is ; "
30153	30193	30142	30142	He	5573	" I made them cut a whole loin into chops , besides the cauliflower ; and such a big rice - pudding , and eggs and bacon too ! Cheer up ! it will be served in a minute . "
30194	30199	30201	30201	Kenelm	261	" A - h ! "
30203	30250	30142	30142	He	5573	" They are good people ; they did not mean to stint you : but most of their customers , it seems , live upon vegetables and farinaceous food . There is a society here formed upon that principle ; the landlady says they are philosophers ! "
30254	30256	30142	30142	He	5573	" philosophers "
30271	30278	30264	30266	a practised hunter	1483	" Yoiks ! Tally - ho ! "
30279	30282	30284	30284	he	261	" Philosophers ! "
30286	30492	30284	30284	he	261	" philosophers indeed ! O ignoramuses , who do not even know the structure of the human tooth ! Look you , little boy , if nothing were left on this earth of the present race of man , as we are assured upon great authority will be the case one of these days , - and a mighty good riddance it will be , - if nothing , I say , of man were left except fossils of his teeth and his thumbs , a philosopher of that superior race which will succeed to man would at once see in those relics all his characteristics and all his history ; would say , comparing his thumb with the talons of an eagle , the claws of a tiger , the hoof of a horse , the owner of that thumb must have been lord over creatures with talons and claws and hoofs . You may say the monkey tribe has thumbs . True ; but compare an ape 's thumb with a man 's : could the biggest ape 's thumb have built Westminster Abbey ? But even thumbs are trivial evidence of man as compared with his teeth . Look at his teeth ! "
30532	30542	30543	30544	The boy	5573	" look , I say , at his teeth ! "
30548	30592	30594	30594	Kenelm	261	" Are the teeth those of a miserable cauliflower - eater ? or is it purely by farinaceous food that the proprietor of teeth like man 's obtains the rank of the sovereign destroyer of creation ? No , little boy , no , "
30616	30753	30755	30755	Kenelm	261	" no ; man is the master of the world , because of all created beings he devours the greatest variety and the greatest number of created things . His teeth evince that man can live upon every soil from the torrid to the frozen zone , because man can eat everything that other creatures can not eat . And the formation of his teeth proves it . A tiger can eat a deer ; so can man : but a tiger ca n't eat an eel ; man can . An elephant can eat cauliflowers and rice - pudding ; so can man ! but an elephant ca n't eat a beefsteak ; man can . In sum , man can live everywhere , because he can eat anything , thanks to his dental formation ! "
30765	30779	30755	30755	Kenelm	261	" Man , when everything else fails him , eats his own species . "
30780	30788	30790	30791	the boy	5573	" Do n't ; you frighten me , "
30793	30796	30790	30791	the boy	5573	" Aha ! "
30807	30815	30790	30791	the boy	5573	" here come the mutton - chops ! "
30874	30891	30856	30857	the handmaiden	1490	" Mistress is sorry to have kept you waiting , but she thought you were Vegetarians . "
30911	30973	30975	30975	Kenelm	261	" Tell your mistress that if she had only given us vegetables , I should have eaten you . Tell her that though man is partially graminivorous , he is principally carnivorous . Tell her that though a swine eats cabbages and such like , yet where a swine can get a baby , it eats the baby . Tell her , "
30982	31027	30975	30975	Kenelm	261	" that there is no animal that in digestive organs more resembles man than a swine . Ask her if there is any baby in the house ; if so , it would be safe for the baby to send up some more chops . "
31075	31089	31060	31060	Kenelm	261	" I should be so sorry for the baby . Bring the chops ! "
31129	31133	31135	31136	the boy	5573	" No more , "
31148	31158	31135	31136	the boy	5573	" I have dined : I have had enough . "
31159	31166	31168	31168	Kenelm	261	" Little boy , you lie , "
31170	31198	31168	31168	Kenelm	261	" you have not had enough to keep body and soul together . Eat that chop or I shall thrash you : whatever I say I do . "
31226	31231	31207	31207	he	5573	" I am afraid . "
31322	31330	31316	31317	the boy	5573	" May I ask you another favour ? "
31331	31348	31316	31317	the boy	5573	" Is it to knock down another uncle , or to steal another gig and cob ? "
31349	31381	31316	31317	the boy	5573	" No , it is very simple : it is merely to find out the address of a friend here ; and when found to give him a note from me . "
31382	31438	31316	31317	the boy	5573	" Does the commission press ? ' After dinner , rest a while , ' saith the proverb ; and proverbs are so wise that no one can guess the author of them . They are supposed to be fragments of the philosophy of the antediluvians : came to us packed up in the ark . "
31439	31444	31446	31447	the boy	5573	" Really , indeed , "
31451	31482	31446	31447	the boy	5573	" How interesting ! No , my commission does not press for an hour or so . Do you think , sir , they had any drama before the Deluge ? "
31483	31607	31316	31317	the boy	5573	" Drama ! not a doubt of it . Men who lived one or two thousand years had time to invent and improve everything ; and a play could have had its natural length then . It would not have been necessary to crowd the whole history of Macbeth , from his youth to his old age , into an absurd epitome of three hours . One can not trace a touch of real human nature in any actor 's delineation of that very interesting Scotchman , because the actor always comes on the stage as if he were the same age when he murdered Duncan , and when , in his sear and yellow leaf , he was lopped off by Macduff . "
31608	31620	31446	31447	the boy	5573	" Do you think Macbeth was young when he murdered Duncan ? "
31621	31848	31316	31317	the boy	5573	" Certainly . No man ever commits a first crime of violent nature , such as murder , after thirty ; if he begins before , he may go on up to any age . But youth is the season for commencing those wrong calculations which belong to irrational hope and the sense of physical power . You thus read in the newspapers that the persons who murder their sweethearts are generally from two to six and twenty ; and persons who murder from other motives than love - that is , from revenge , avarice , or ambition - are generally about twenty - eight , - Iago 's age . Twenty - eight is the usual close of the active season for getting rid of one 's fellow - creatures ; a prize - fighter falls off after that age . I take it that Macbeth was about twenty - eight when he murdered Duncan , and from about fifty - four to sixty when he began to whine about missing the comforts of old age . But can any audience understand that difference of years in seeing a three - hours ' play ? or does any actor ever pretend to impress it on the audience , and appear as twenty - eight in the first act and a sexagenarian in the fifth ? "
31849	31856	31858	31859	the boy	5573	" I never thought of that , "
31864	31908	31858	31859	the boy	5573	" But I never saw ' Macbeth . ' I have seen ' Richard III . : ' is not that nice ? Do n't you dote on the play ? I do . What a glorious life an actor 's must be ! "
31940	31987	31909	31909	Kenelm	261	" I see you are stage - stricken . You have run away from home in order to turn player , and I should not wonder if this note you want me to give is for the manager of the theatre or one of his company . "
32009	32022	32189	32189	he	5573	" And what if it were ? would not you give it ? "
32023	32053	32189	32189	he	5573	" What ! help a child of your age run away from his home , to go upon the stage against the consent of his relations ? Certainly not . "
32054	32183	32189	32189	he	5573	" I am not a child ; but that has nothing to do with it . I do n't want to go on the stage , at all events without the consent of the person who has a right to dictate my actions . My note is not to the manager of the theatre , nor to one of his company ; but it is to a gentleman who condescends to act here for a few nights ; a thorough gentleman , - a great actor , - my friend , the only friend I have in the world . I say frankly I have run away from home so that he may have that note , and if you will not give it some one else will ! "
32243	32250	32252	32252	Kenelm	261	" I will take your note , "
32254	32277	32292	32295	the door - keeper	1510	" There it is ; give it into the hands of the person it is addressed to , - Mr. Herbert Compton . "
32305	32322	32301	32302	That functionary	1511	" Mr. Compton does not act to - night , and is not in the house . "
32323	32329	32330	32333	The door - keeper	1510	" Where does he lodge ? "
32352	32362	32330	32333	The door - keeper	1510	" There , private door ; knock and ring . "
32399	32407	32412	32412	his	261	" I am sorry to disturb him , "
32433	32443	32451	32451	he	261	" but my business requires to see him forthwith ; "
32559	32566	32568	32568	Kenelm	261	" Mr. Compton , I presume , "
32575	32595	32568	32568	Kenelm	261	" My name is Compton : any message from the theatre ? or what do you want with me ? "
32596	32601	32603	32603	Kenelm	261	" I - nothing ! "
32620	32630	32632	32632	he	261	" By whom you are wanted let this explain ; "
32666	32676	32649	32649	his	261	" ' Qu'en dis - tu , Brute ? ' "
32728	32735	32737	32748	the lady with blond ringlets , in a tone of stinging affability	1525	" Never mind me , dear , "
32750	32767	32737	32748	the lady with blond ringlets , in a tone of stinging affability	1525	" read your billet - doux ; do n't keep the young man waiting , love ! "
32768	32803	32812	32812	he	317	" Nonsense , Matilda , nonsense ! billet - doux indeed ! more likely a bill from Duke the tailor . Excuse me for a moment , my dear . Follow me , sir , "
32869	32883	32895	32895	he	317	" Good heavens , how very absurd ! what 's to be done ? "
32919	32932	32934	32935	Mr. Compton	317	" Are you in the confidence of the writer of this letter ? "
32940	32950	32952	32952	Kenelm	261	" I am not the confidant of the writer , "
32954	32965	32952	32952	Kenelm	261	" but for the time being I am the protector ! "
32966	32969	33017	33017	he	317	" Protector ! "
32970	32973	32952	32952	Kenelm	261	" Protector . "
33020	33046	33017	33017	he	317	" I am requested to call on the writer . If I do so , may I understand that the interview will be strictly private ? "
33047	33073	32952	32952	Kenelm	261	" So far as I am concerned , yes : on the condition that no attempt be made to withdraw the writer from the house . "
33074	33085	33087	33088	Mr. Compton	317	" Certainly not , certainly not ; quite the contrary , "
33094	33104	33087	33088	Mr. Compton	317	" Say I will call in half an hour . "
33105	33112	33114	33114	Kenelm	261	" I will give your message , "
33124	33186	33121	33121	his	261	" and pray pardon me if I remind you that I styled myself the protector of your correspondent , and if the slightest advantage be taken of that correspondent 's youth and inexperience or the smallest encouragement be given to plans of abduction from home and friends , the stage will lose an ornament and Herbert Compton vanish from the scene . "
33218	33221	33223	33224	the lad	1534	" Stupid , "
33226	33242	33223	33224	the lad	1534	" ca n't you see where you are going ? Give this to Mrs. Compton . "
33243	33264	33266	33266	Kenelm	261	" I should deserve the title you give if I did for nothing the business for which you are paid , "
33276	33283	33285	33285	Kenelm	261	" I HAVE fulfilled my mission , "
33293	33306	33285	33285	Kenelm	261	" Mr. Compton said he would be here in half an hour . "
33307	33312	33223	33224	the lad	1534	" You saw him ? "
33313	33328	33285	33285	Kenelm	261	" Of course : I promised to give your letter into his own hands . "
33329	33334	33223	33224	the lad	1534	" Was he alone ? "
33335	33344	33285	33285	Kenelm	261	" No ; at supper with his wife . "
33345	33364	33223	33224	the lad	1534	" His wife ! what do you mean , sir ? - wife ! he has no wife . "
33365	33431	33285	33285	Kenelm	261	" Appearances are deceitful . At least he was with a lady who called him ' dear ' and ' love ' in as spiteful a tone of voice as if she had been his wife ; and as I was coming out of his street - door a lad who ran against me asked me to give a band - box to Mrs. Compton . "
33497	33538	33471	33471	He	261	" This is no boy 's agitation . If you have been deceived or misled , and I can in any way advise or aid you , count on me as women under the circumstances count on men and gentlemen . "
33594	33632	33572	33572	he	5573	" I thank you , - I bless you . Leave me now : I would be alone . Alone , too , I must face this man . There may be some mistake yet ; go . "
33633	33646	33572	33572	he	5573	" You will promise not to leave the house till I return ? "
33647	33654	33572	33572	he	5573	" Yes , I promise that . "
33655	33675	33572	33572	he	5573	" And if it be as I fear , you will then let me counsel with and advise you ? "
33676	33695	33572	33572	he	5573	" Heaven help me , if so ! Whom else should I trust to ? Go , go ! "
33748	33932	33732	33732	he	261	" Kenelm , my friend , you are in a still worse scrape than I thought you were an hour ago . You have evidently now got a woman on your hands . What on earth are you to do with her ? A runaway woman , who , meaning to run off with somebody else - such are the crosses and contradictions in human destiny - has run off with you instead . What mortal can hope to be safe ? The last thing I thought could befall me when I got up this morning was that I should have any trouble about the other sex before the day was over . If I were of an amatory temperament , the Fates might have some justification for leading me into this snare , but , as it is , those meddling old maids have none . Kenelm , my friend , do you think you ever can be in love ? and , if you were in love , do you think you could be a greater fool than you are now ? "
34495	34518	34491	34491	he	261	" Judging by the little I heard , you sing very well , sir . May I ask who composed the words ? "
34519	34524	34526	34527	the singer	1562	" They are mine , "
34529	34534	34491	34491	he	261	" And the air ? "
34535	34539	34579	34579	his	1562	" Mine too . "
34540	34555	34491	34491	he	261	" Accept my compliments . I hope you find these manifestations of genius lucrative ? "
34592	34605	34579	34579	his	1562	" Your voice betrays you , sir . We have met before . "
34606	34640	34579	34579	his	1562	" True ; but I did not then notice your guitar , nor , though acquainted with your poetical gifts , suppose that you selected this primitive method of making them publicly known . "
34641	34685	34579	34579	his	1562	" Nor did I anticipate the pleasure of meeting you again in the character of Hobnail . Hist ! let us keep each other 's secret . I am known hereabouts by no other designation than that of the ' Wandering Minstrel . ' "
34686	34721	34579	34579	his	1562	" It is in the capacity of minstrel that I address you . If it be not an impertinent question , do you know any songs which take the other side of the case ? "
34722	34734	34579	34579	his	1562	" What case ? I do n't understand you , sir . "
34735	34774	34579	34579	his	1562	" The song I heard seemed in praise of that sham called love . Do n't you think you could say something more new and more true , treating that aberration from reason with the contempt it deserves ? "
34775	34787	34579	34579	his	1562	" Not if I am to get my travelling expenses paid . "
34788	34797	34579	34579	his	1562	" What ! the folly is so popular ? "
34798	34808	34579	34579	his	1562	" Does not your own heart tell you so ? "
34809	34901	34579	34579	his	1562	" Not a bit of it , - rather the contrary . Your audience at present seem folks who live by work , and can have little time for such idle phantasies ; for , as it is well observed by Ovid , a poet who wrote much on that subject , and professed the most intimate acquaintance with it , ' Idleness is the parent of love . ' Ca n't you sing something in praise of a good dinner ? Everybody who works hard has an appetite for food . "
34938	34942	34944	34944	Kenelm	261	" I perceive , "
34946	35031	34944	34944	Kenelm	261	" that my observations surprise you : the surprise will vanish on reflection . It has been said by another poet , more reflective than Ovid , that ' the world is governed by love and hunger . ' But hunger certainly has the lion 's share of the government ; and if a poet is really to do what he pretends to do , - namely , represent nature , - the greater part of his lays should be addressed to the stomach . "
35060	35208	35051	35051	his	1562	" You will allow that a man in the normal condition of health does not fall in love every day . But in the normal condition of health he is hungry every day . Nay , in those early years when you poets say he is most prone to love , he is so especially disposed to hunger that less than three meals a day can scarcely satisfy his appetite . You may imprison a man for months , for years , nay , for his whole life , - from infancy to any age which Sir Cornewall Lewis may allow him to attain , - without letting him be in love at all . But if you shut him up for a week without putting something into his stomach , you will find him at the end of it as dead as a door - nail . "
35238	35263	35210	35211	the singer	1562	" Sir , you have fairly argued me down . Will you please to come to the conclusion which you deduce from your premises ? "
35264	35341	35210	35211	the singer	1562	" Simply this , that where you find one human being who cares about love , you will find a thousand susceptible to the charms of a dinner ; and if you wish to be the popular minne - singer or troubadour of the age , appeal to nature , sir , - appeal to nature ; drop all hackneyed rhapsodies about a rosy cheek , and strike your lyre to the theme of a beefsteak . "
35434	35447	35425	35426	The singer	1562	" Excuse me , sir ; but I am called upon to - "
35448	35453	35409	35410	the audience	6258	" To sing again ? "
35454	35457	35425	35426	The singer	1562	" Yes . "
35458	35466	35409	35410	the audience	6258	" And on the subject I suggest ? "
35467	35472	35425	35426	The singer	1562	" No , indeed . "
35473	35480	35409	35410	the audience	6258	" What ! love , again ? "
35481	35487	35425	35426	The singer	1562	" I am afraid so . "
35488	35529	35409	35410	the audience	6258	" I wish you good evening then . You seem a well - educated man , - more shame to you . Perhaps we may meet once more in our rambles , when the question can be properly argued out . "
35577	35580	35551	35552	the singer	1562	" love . "
35581	35588	35590	35590	Kenelm	261	" Fiddle - de - dee , "
35636	35639	35641	35641	Kenelm	261	" Hem ! "
35643	35663	35641	35641	Kenelm	261	" I do n't think there is much triumph in that face . I suspect he has been scolded . "
35714	35719	35721	35721	Kenelm	261	" My dear child , "
35732	35762	35721	35721	Kenelm	261	" do not honour me with any confidence that may be painful . But let me hope that you have dismissed forever all thoughts of going on the stage . "
35763	35766	35728	35728	his	261	" Yes , "
35773	35789	35721	35721	Kenelm	261	" And now only remains the question , ' What is to be done ? ' "
35790	35805	35728	35728	his	261	" I am sure I do n't know , and I do n't care . "
35806	35940	35721	35721	Kenelm	261	" Then you leave it to me to know and to care ; and assuming for the moment as a fact that which is one of the greatest lies in this mendacious world - namely , that all men are brothers - you will consider me as an elder brother , who will counsel and control you as he would an imprudent young - sister . I see very well how it is . Somehow or other you , having first admired Mr. Compton as Romeo or Richard III . , made his acquaintance as Mr. Compton . He allowed you to believe him a single man . In a romantic moment you escaped from your home , with the design of adopting the profession of the stage and of becoming Mrs. Compton . "
35941	35944	35947	35948	the girl	1594	" Oh , "
35958	35961	35962	35962	she	1594	" oh , "
35970	36032	35962	35962	she	1594	" what a fool I have been ! Only do not think worse of me than I deserve . The man did deceive me ; he did not think I should take him at his word , and follow him here , or his wife would not have appeared . I should not have known he had one and - and - "
36042	36078	35721	35721	Kenelm	261	" But now you have discovered the truth , let us thank Heaven that you are saved from shame and misery . I must despatch a telegram to your uncle : give me his address . "
36079	36084	35947	35948	the girl	1594	" No , no . "
36085	36205	35721	35721	Kenelm	261	" There is not a ' No ' possible in this case , my child . Your reputation and your future must be saved . Leave me to explain all to your uncle . He is your guardian . I must send for him ; nay , nay , there is no option . Hate me now for enforcing your will : you will thank me hereafter . And listen , young lady ; if it does pain you to see your uncle , and encounter his reproaches , every fault must undergo its punishment . A brave nature undergoes it cheerfully , as a part of atonement . You are brave . Submit , and in submitting rejoice ! "
36239	36251	36231	36231	She	1595	" John Bovill , Esq . , Oakdale , near Westmere . "
36276	36291	36257	36257	she	1595	" Now , will you esteem me more , or rather despise me less ? "
36343	36385	36326	36326	he	261	" If human beings despise each other for being young and foolish , the sooner we are exterminated by that superior race which is to succeed us on earth the better it will be . Adieu , till your uncle comes . "
36386	36396	36326	36326	he	261	" What ! you leave me here - alone ? "
36397	36478	36326	36326	he	261	" Nay , if your uncle found me under the same roof , now that I know you are his niece , do n't you think he would have a right to throw me out of the window ? Allow me to practise for myself the prudence I preach to you . Send for the landlady to show you your room , shut yourself in there , go to bed , and do n't cry more than you can help . "
36525	36554	36326	36326	he	261	" Rouchefoucauld was perfectly right when he said , ' Very few people would fall in love if they had not heard it so much talked about . ' "
36626	36631	36633	36633	he	261	" That 's right , "
36638	36651	36633	36633	he	261	" I am glad to see you are so early a riser . "
36652	36655	36657	36658	the hostler	1606	" Why , "
36660	36694	36657	36658	the hostler	1606	" the gentleman as owns the pony knocked me up at two o'clock in the morning , and pleased enough he was to see the creature again lying down in the clean straw . "
36695	36713	36657	36658	the hostler	1606	" Oh , he has arrived at the hotel , I presume ? - a stout gentleman ? "
36714	36765	36657	36658	the hostler	1606	" Yes , stout enough ; and a passionate gentleman too . Came in a yellow and two posters , knocked up the Temperance and then knocked up me to see for the pony , and was much put out as he could not get any grog at the Temperance . "
36766	36794	36796	36796	Kenelm	261	" I dare say he was . I wish he had got his grog : it might have put him in better humour . Poor little thing ! "
36801	36842	36796	36796	Kenelm	261	" I am afraid she is in for a regular vituperation . My turn next , I suppose . But he must be a good fellow to have come at once for his niece in the dead of the night . "
36932	36949	36924	36924	his	336	" Sir , you are a gentleman ; sit down , sit down and take breakfast . "
36968	36989	36963	36964	the uncle	1615	" I have heard all your good conduct from this young simpleton . Things might have been worse , sir . "
37020	37033	37016	37016	he	261	" I hope you forgive me for that unfortunate mistake , when - "
37034	37121	37016	37016	he	261	" You knocked me down , or rather tripped me up . All right now . Elsie , give the gentleman a cup of tea . Pretty little rogue , is she not ? and a good girl , in spite of her nonsense . It was all my fault letting her go to the play and be intimate with Miss Lockit , a stage - stricken , foolish old maid , who ought to have known better than to lead her into all this trouble . "
37122	37127	37129	37130	the girl	1594	" No , uncle , "
37134	37146	37129	37130	the girl	1594	" do n't blame her , nor any one but me . "
37207	37210	37212	37213	the uncle	1615	" Ah ! "
37215	37269	37212	37213	the uncle	1615	" just like you , Elsie ; always ready to take everybody 's fault on your own shoulders . Well , well , say no more about that . Now , my young friend , what brings you across the country tramping it on foot , eh ? a young man 's whim ? "
37323	37334	37336	37336	Kenelm	261	" I travel on foot to please myself , sir , "
37347	37353	37355	37356	Mr. Bovill	336	" Of course you do , "
37363	37397	37355	37356	Mr. Bovill	336	" But it seems you do n't object to a chaise and pony whenever you can get them for nothing , - ha , ha ! - excuse me , - a joke . "
37523	37590	37504	37505	Mr. Bovill	336	" Just as I thought , sir ; you know nothing of these matters : you are a gentleman born and bred ; your clothes ca n't disguise you , sir . Elsie was right . My dear , just leave us for a few minutes : I have something to say to our young friend . You can get ready meanwhile to go with me . "
37727	37733	37735	37736	the former	1628	" Now , young sir , "
37738	37764	37735	37736	the former	1628	" you and I can talk at our ease . That adventure of yours yesterday may be the luckiest thing that could happen to you . "
37765	37826	37717	37717	himself	336	" It is sufficiently lucky if I have been of any service to your niece . But her own good sense would have been her safeguard if she had been alone , and discovered , as she would have done , that Mr. Compton had , knowingly or not , misled her to believe that he was a single man . "
37827	38024	37735	37736	the former	1628	" Hang Mr. Compton ! we have done with him . I am a plain man , and I come to the point . It is you who have carried off my niece ; it is with you that she came to this hotel . Now when Elsie told me how well you had behaved , and that your language and manners were those of a real gentleman , my mind was made up . I guess pretty well what you are ; you are a gentleman 's son ; probably a college youth ; not overburdened with cash ; had a quarrel with your governor , and he keeps you short . Do n't interrupt me . Well , Elsie is a good girl and a pretty girl , and will make a good wife , as wives go ; and , hark ye , she has L20,000 . So just confide in me ; and if you do n't like your parents to know about it till the thing 's done and they be only got to forgive and bless you , why , you shall marry Elsie before you can say Jack Robinson . "
38077	38080	38071	38071	he	1629	" Marry ! "
38081	38261	38476	38476	Kenelm	261	" Yes ; marry . If you are a gentleman you are bound to it . You have compromised my niece , - a respectable , virtuous girl , sir ; an orphan , but not unprotected . I repeat , it is you who have plucked her from my very arms , and with violence and assault eloped with her ; and what would the world say if it knew ? Would it believe in your prudent conduct ? - conduct only to be explained by the respect you felt due to your future wife . And where will you find a better ? Where will you find an uncle who will part with his ward and L20,000 without asking if you have a sixpence ? and the girl has taken a fancy to you ; I see it : would she have given up that player so easily if you had not stolen her heart ? Would you break that heart ? No , young man : you are not a villain . Shake hands on it ! "
38262	38266	38268	38268	Kenelm	261	" Mr. Bovill , "
38275	38474	38268	38268	Kenelm	261	" I am inexpressibly flattered by the honour you propose to me , and I do not deny that Miss Elsie is worthy of a much better man than myself . But I have inconceivable prejudices against the connubial state . If it be permitted to a member of the Established Church to cavil at any sentence written by Saint Paul , - and I think that liberty may be permitted to a simple layman , since eminent members of the clergy criticise the whole Bible as freely as if it were the history of Queen Elizabeth by Mr. Froude , - I should demur at the doctrine that it is better to marry than to burn : I myself should prefer burning . With these sentiments it would ill become any one entitled to that distinction of ' gentleman ' which you confer on me to lead a fellow - victim to the sacrificial altar . As for any reproach attached to Miss Elsie , since in my telegram I directed you to ask for a young gentleman at this hotel , her very sex is not known in this place unless you divulge it . And - "
38514	38584	38501	38501	he	261	" Sir , you are mocking me : John Bovill is not a man to be jeered in this way . You shall marry the girl . I 'll not have her thrust back upon me to be the plague of my life with her whims and tantrums . You have taken her , and you shall keep her , or I 'll break every bone in your skin . "
38585	38589	38591	38591	Kenelm	261	" Break them , "
38647	38790	38629	38629	Kenelm	261	" When you recover your habitual serenity of humour , Mr. Bovill , you will see how much your very excusable desire to secure your niece 's happiness , and , I may add , to reward what you allow to have been forbearing and well - bred conduct on my part , has hurried you into an error of judgment . You know nothing of me . I may be , for what you know , an impostor or swindler ; I may have every bad quality , and yet you are to be contented with my assurance , or rather your own assumption , that I am born a gentleman , in order to give me your niece and her L20,000 . This is temporary insanity on your part . Allow me to leave you to recover from your excitement . "
38791	38796	38798	38799	Mr. Bovill	336	" Stop , sir , "
38808	39005	38798	38799	Mr. Bovill	336	" I am not quite the madman you think me . But I dare say I have been too hasty and too rough . Nevertheless the facts are as I have stated them , and I do not see how , as a man of honour , you can get off marrying my niece . The mistake you made in running away with her was , no doubt , innocent on your part : but still there it is ; and supposing the case came before a jury , it would be an ugly one for you and your family . Marriage alone could mend it . Come , come , I own I was too business - like in rushing to the point at once , and I no longer say , ' Marry my niece off - hand . ' You have only seen her disguised and in a false position . Pay me a visit at Oakdale ; stay with me a month ; and if at the end of that time you do not like her well enough to propose , I 'll let you off and say no more about it . "
39072	39078	39040	39040	she	340	" Uncle , for shame ! "
39089	39101	39102	39102	she	340	" Oh , do not believe I knew anything of this ! "
39151	39193	39199	39199	he	261	" I am as convinced that your uncle 's words are abhorrent to you as I am that you are a pure - hearted and high - spirited woman , of whose friendship I shall be proud . We meet again . "
39204	39243	39199	39199	he	261	" Sir , you are unworthy the charge of your niece . Had you not been so , she would have committed no imprudence . If she have any female relation , to that relation transfer your charge . "
39244	39251	39253	39253	Elsie	340	" I have ! I have ! "
39255	39268	39253	39253	Elsie	340	" my lost mother 's sister : let me go to her . "
39269	39277	39279	39280	Mr. Bovill	336	" The woman who keeps a school ! "
39283	39287	39289	39289	Kenelm	261	" Why not ? "
39291	39316	39253	39253	Elsie	340	" She never would go there . I proposed it to her a year ago . The minx would not go into a school . "
39317	39324	39253	39253	Elsie	340	" I will now , Uncle . "
39325	39512	39253	39253	Elsie	340	" Well , then , you shall at once ; and I hope you 'll be put on bread and water . Fool ! fool ! you have spoilt your own game . Mr. Chillingly , now that Miss Elsie has turned her back on herself , I can convince you that I am not the mad man you thought me . I was at the festive meeting held when you came of age : my brother is one of your father 's tenants . I did not recognize your face immediately in the excitement of our encounter and in your change of dress ; but in walking home it struck me that I had seen it before , and I knew it at once when you entered the room to - day . It has been a tussle between us which should beat the other . You have beat me ; and thanks to that idiot ! If she had not put her spoke into my wheel , she would have lived to be ' my lady . ' Now good - day , sir . "
39513	39564	39567	39568	Mr. Bovill	336	" Mr. Bovill , you offered to shake hands : shake hands now , and promise me , with the good grace of one honourable combatant to another , that Miss Elsie shall go to her aunt the schoolmistress at once if she wishes it . Hark ye , my friend "
39572	39612	39567	39568	Mr. Bovill	336	" a man can never manage a woman . Till a woman marries , a prudent man leaves her to women ; when she does marry , she manages her husband , and there 's an end of it . "
39617	39624	39626	39627	the uncle	1615	" Oh , wise young man ! "
39629	39649	39626	39627	the uncle	1615	" Elsie , dear , how can you go to your aunt 's while you are in that dress ? "
39669	39673	39674	39674	she	340	" This dress , "
39678	39693	39674	39674	she	340	" this dress ; is not that easily altered with shops in the town ? "
39694	39697	39699	39700	Mr. Bovill	336	" Gad ! "
39702	39729	39699	39700	Mr. Bovill	336	" that youngster is a second Solomon ; and if I ca n't manage Elsie , she 'll manage a husband - whenever she gets one . "
39733	39743	39745	39745	Kenelm	261	" BY the powers that guard innocence and celibacy , "
39748	39887	39745	39745	Kenelm	261	" but I have had a narrow escape ! and had that amphibious creature been in girl 's clothes instead of boy 's , when she intervened like the deity of the ancient drama , I might have plunged my armorial Fishes into hot water . Though , indeed , it is hard to suppose that a young lady head - over - ears in love with Mr. Compton yesterday could have consigned her affections to me to - day . Still she looked as if she could , which proves either that one is never to trust a woman 's heart or never to trust a woman 's looks . Decimus Roach is right . Man must never relax his flight from the women , if he strives to achieve an ' Approach to the Angels . ' "
40122	40125	40120	40120	we	1646	" revery . "
40199	40239	40244	40244	himself	261	" Young man , if you are not too tired , will you lend a hand to get in my hay ? We are very short of hands , and I am afraid we shall have rain pretty soon . "
40259	40287	40254	40254	his	261	" Man is born to help his fellow - man , - especially to get in hay while the sun shines . I am at your service . "
40288	40327	40338	40338	he	261	" That 's a good fellow , and I 'm greatly obliged to you . You see I had counted on a gang of roving haymakers , but they were bought up by another farmer . This way ; "
40440	40443	40445	40445	he	261	" handiness , "
40508	40515	40516	40516	she	1655	" This is new to you , "
40520	40527	40529	40529	Kenelm	261	" Nothing is new to me , "
40533	40564	40529	40529	Kenelm	261	" But allow me to observe that to do things well you should only do one thing at a time . I am here to make hay and not conversation . "
40565	40568	40570	40571	the girl	1594	" My ! "
40588	40599	40601	40601	Kenelm	261	" I wonder if that jade has got an uncle , "
40683	40690	40692	40693	the farmer	1658	" Be n't it eno ' ? "
40697	40701	40703	40703	Kenelm	261	" Pardon me , "
40705	40776	40703	40703	Kenelm	261	" But , to tell you the truth , it is the first money I ever earned by my own bodily labour ; and I regard it with equal curiosity and respect . But if it would not offend you , I would rather that , instead of the money , you had offered me some supper ; for I have tasted nothing but bread and water since the morning . "
40777	40790	40792	40793	the farmer	1658	" You shall have the money and supper both , my lad , "
40797	40846	40792	40793	the farmer	1658	" And if you will stay and help till I have got in the hay , I dare say my good woman can find you a better bed than you 'll get in the village inn ; if , indeed , you can get one there at all . "
40847	40870	40703	40703	Kenelm	261	" You are very kind . But before I accept your hospitality excuse one question : have you any nieces about you ? "
40871	40874	40876	40877	the farmer	1658	" Nieces ! "
40896	40914	40876	40877	the farmer	1658	" nieces about me ! what do you mean ? Be that a newfangled word for coppers ? "
40915	40946	40947	40948	The farmer	1658	" Not for coppers , though perhaps for brass . But I spoke without metaphor . I object to nieces upon abstract principle , confirmed by the test of experience . "
40979	41006	40964	40964	he	1658	" Make yourself easy , then . I have only one niece , and she is married to an iron - monger and lives in Exeter . "
41052	41088	41042	41044	a stout girl	1670	" Hulloa ! old woman , I have brought you a guest who has well earned his supper , for he has done the work of two , and I have promised him a bed . "
41097	41110	41111	41111	she	1672	" He is heartily welcome to supper . As to a bed , "
41115	41121	41111	41111	she	1672	" I do n't know . "
41165	41198	41150	41150	she	1672	" The gentleman shall have the guest - room : but it will take a little time to get ready ; you know , John , all the furniture is covered up . "
41199	41226	41150	41150	she	1672	" Well , wife , there will be leisure eno ' for that . He do n't want to go to roost till he has supped . "
41227	41231	41233	41233	Kenelm	261	" Certainly not , "
41241	41247	41249	41250	the farmer	1658	" Where are the girls ? "
41252	41268	41150	41150	she	1672	" They have been in these five minutes , and gone upstairs to tidy themselves . "
41269	41273	41275	41275	Kenelm	261	" What girls ? "
41282	41292	41275	41275	Kenelm	261	" I thought you said you had no nieces . "
41293	41316	41150	41150	she	1672	" But I did not say I had no daughters . Why , you are not afraid of them , are you ? "
41317	41320	41322	41322	Kenelm	261	" Sir , "
41334	41353	41322	41322	Kenelm	261	" if your daughters are like their mother , you ca n't say that they are not dangerous . "
41354	41357	41359	41360	the farmer	1658	" Come , "
41374	41415	41368	41369	his dame	1676	" come , that 's as nicely said as if you were canvassing the county . ' Tis not among haymakers that you learned manners , I guess ; and perhaps I have been making too free with my betters . "
41416	41419	41421	41423	the courteous Kenelm	1677	" What ! "
41425	41508	41421	41423	the courteous Kenelm	1677	" do you mean to imply that you were too free with your shillings ? Apologize for that , if you like , but I do n't think you 'll get back the shillings . I have not seen so much of this life as you have , but , according to my experience , when a man once parts with his money , whether to his betters or his worsers , the chances are that he 'll never see it again . "
41548	41595	41536	41536	Kenelm	261	" Wit consists in the epigrammatic expression of a commonplace truth , and the dullest remark on the worth of money is almost as sure of successful appreciation as the dullest remark on the worthlessness of women . Certainly I am a wit without knowing it . "
41626	41661	41614	41614	he	1658	" We must not disturb the Missis or we shall get no supper . I 'll just go and give a look into the cow - sheds . Do you know much about cows ? "
41662	41741	41614	41614	he	1658	" Yes , cows produce cream and butter . The best cows are those which produce at the least cost the best cream and butter . But how the best cream and butter can be produced at a price which will place them free of expense on a poor man 's breakfast - table is a question to be settled by a Reformed Parliament and a Liberal Administration . In the meanwhile let us not delay the supper . "
41755	41765	41614	41614	he	1658	" You are quite a stranger in these parts ? "
41766	41769	41614	41614	he	1658	" Quite . "
41770	41779	41614	41614	he	1658	" You do n't even know my name ? "
41780	41793	41614	41614	he	1658	" No , except that I heard your wife call you John . "
41794	41801	41614	41614	he	1658	" My name is John Saunderson . "
41802	41881	41614	41614	he	1658	" Ah ! you come from the North , then ? That 's why you are so sensible and shrewd . Names that end in ' son ' are chiefly borne by the descendants of the Danes , to whom King Alfred , Heaven bless him ! peacefully assigned no less than sixteen English counties . And when a Dane was called somebody 's son , it is a sign that he was the son of a somebody . "
41882	41892	41614	41614	he	1658	" By gosh ! I never heard that before . "
41893	41906	41614	41614	he	1658	" If I thought you had I should not have said it . "
41907	41920	41614	41614	he	1658	" Now I have told you my name , what is yours ? "
41921	41944	41614	41614	he	1658	" A wise man asks questions and a fool answers them . Suppose for a moment that I am not a fool . "
41972	41976	41978	41978	he	351	" Dash it , "
41982	41991	41978	41978	he	351	" but I think you are Yorkshire too . "
41992	42108	42110	42111	the farmer	1658	" Man , who is the most conceited of all animals , says that he alone has the prerogative of thought , and condemns the other animals to the meaner mechanical operation which he calls instinct . But as instincts are unerring and thoughts generally go wrong , man has not much to boast of according to his own definition . When you say you think , and take it for granted , that I am Yorkshire , you err . I am not Yorkshire . Confining yourself to instinct , can you divine when we shall sup ? The cows you are about to visit divine to a moment when they shall be fed . "
42128	42133	42110	42111	the farmer	1658	" In ten minutes . "
42160	42254	42157	42157	he	1658	" We do n't sup in the kitchen . My father did , and so did I till I married ; but my Bess , though she 's as good a farmer 's wife as ever wore shoe - leather , was a tradesman 's daughter , and had been brought up different . You see she was not without a good bit of money : but even if she had been , I should not have liked her folks to say I had lowered her ; so we sup in the parlour . "
42258	42316	42255	42256	Quoth Kenelm	261	" The first consideration is to sup at all . Supper conceded , every man is more likely to get on in life who would rather sup in his parlour than his kitchen . Meanwhile , I see a pump ; while you go to the cows I will stay here and wash my hands of them . "
42317	42380	42157	42157	he	1658	" Hold ! you seem a sharp fellow , and certainly no fool . I have a son , a good smart chap , but stuck up ; crows it over us all ; thinks no small beer of himself . You 'd do me a service , and him too , if you 'd let him down a peg or two . "
42429	42510	42412	42412	he	261	" One ca n't wonder why every small man thinks it so pleasant to let down a big one , when a father asks a stranger to let down his own son for even fancying that he is not small beer . It is upon that principle in human nature that criticism wisely relinquishes its pretensions as an analytical science , and becomes a lucrative profession . It relies on the pleasure its readers find in letting a man down . "
42966	42973	42975	42975	he	261	" There is safety in numbers , "
42977	42995	42975	42975	he	261	" especially in odd numbers . The three Graces never married , neither did the nine Muses . "
42996	43010	43012	43012	Kenelm	261	" I presume , young ladies , that you are fond of music , "
43019	43027	43029	43031	the eldest girl	1719	" Yes , I love it dearly , "
43055	43115	43043	43043	he	1658	" Things are not what they were when I was a boy ; then it was only great tenant - farmers who had their girls taught the piano , and sent their boys to a good school . Now we small folks are for helping our children a step or two higher than our own place on the ladder . "
43116	43122	43124	43125	the son	1723	" The schoolmaster is abroad , "
43143	43163	43165	43165	Kenelm	261	" There is , no doubt , a greater equality of culture than there was in the last generation , "
43167	43319	43165	43165	Kenelm	261	" People of all ranks utter the same commonplace ideas in very much the same arrangements of syntax . And in proportion as the democracy of intelligence extends - a friend of mine , who is a doctor , tells me that complaints formerly reserved to what is called aristocracy though what that word means in plain English I do n't know are equally shared by the commonalty - tic - douloureux and other neuralgic maladies abound . And the human race , in England at least , is becoming more slight and delicate . There is a fable of a man who , when he became exceedingly old , was turned into a grasshopper . England is very old , and is evidently approaching the grasshopper state of development . Perhaps we do n't eat as much beef as our forefathers did . May I ask you for another slice ? "
43359	43374	43333	43334	the son	1723	" I hope , sir , that you are not an enemy to progress . "
43375	43400	43417	43418	the son	1723	" That depends : for instance , I prefer staying here , where I am well off , to going farther and faring worse . "
43401	43405	43407	43408	the farmer	1658	" Well said ! "
43428	43447	43417	43418	the son	1723	" I suppose you mean that it is to fare worse , if you march with the time . "
43448	43511	43417	43418	the son	1723	" I am afraid we have no option but to march with the time ; but when we reach that stage when to march any farther is to march into old age , we should not be sorry if time would be kind enough to stand still ; and all good doctors concur in advising us to do nothing to hurry him . "
43512	43535	43417	43418	the son	1723	" There is no sign of old age in this country , sir ; and thank Heaven we are not standing still ! "
43536	43604	43417	43418	the son	1723	" Grasshoppers never do ; they are always hopping and jumping , and making what they think ' progress , ' till unless they hop into the water and are swallowed up prematurely by a carp or a frog they die of the exhaustion which hops and jumps unremitting naturally produce . May I ask you , Mrs. Saunderson , for some of that rice - pudding ? "
43640	43659	43611	43611	he	1658	" Bob , my boy , - Bob , our visitor is a little too much for you ! "
43660	43665	43667	43667	Kenelm	261	" Oh , no , "
43671	43707	43667	43667	Kenelm	261	" But I honestly think Mr. Bob would be a wiser man , and a weightier man , and more removed from the grasshopper state , if he would think less and eat more pudding . "
43891	43898	43900	43900	Kenelm	261	" It is a strange thing , "
43902	44081	44082	44082	he	261	" that girls are not unpleasant to look at if you take them collectively , - two or three bound up together ; but if you detach any one of them from the bunch , the odds are that she is as plain as a pikestaff . I wonder whether that bucolical grasshopper , who is so enamoured of the hop and jump that he calls ' progress , ' classes the society of the Mormons among the evidences of civilized advancement ? There is a good deal to be said in favour of taking a whole lot of wives as one may buy a whole lot of cheap razors . For it is not impossible that out of a dozen a good one may be found . And then , too , a whole nosegay of variegated blooms , with a faded leaf here and there , must be more agreeable to the eye than the same monotonous solitary lady 's smock . But I fear these reflections are naughty ; let us change them . Farmer , "
44086	44109	44082	44082	he	261	" I suppose your handsome daughters are too fine to assist you much . I did not see them among the haymakers . "
44110	44179	44382	44384	the jovial farmer	1748	" Oh , they were there , but by themselves , in the back part of the field . I did not want them to mix with all the girls , many of whom are strangers from other places . I do n't know anything against them ; but as I do n't know anything for them , I thought it as well to keep my lasses apart . "
44180	44206	44082	44082	he	261	" But I should have supposed it wiser to keep your son apart from them . I saw him in the thick of those nymphs . "
44207	44210	44212	44213	the farmer	1658	" Well , "
44225	44308	44212	44213	the farmer	1658	" I do n't think lasses not quite well brought up , poor things ! do as much harm to the lads as they can do to proper - behaved lasses ; leastways my wife does not think so . ' Keep good girls from bad girls , ' says she , ' and good girls will never go wrong . ' And you will find there is something in that when you have girls of your own to take care of . "
44309	44373	44082	44082	he	261	" Without waiting for that time , which I trust may never occur , I can recognize the wisdom of your excellent wife 's observation . My own opinion is , that a woman can more easily do mischief to her own sex than to ours ; since , of course , she can not exist without doing mischief to somebody or other . "
44374	44380	44382	44384	the jovial farmer	1748	" And good , too , "
44393	44401	44382	44384	the jovial farmer	1748	" What should we be without women ? "
44402	44438	44536	44536	he	1748	" Very much better , I take it , sir . Adam was as good as gold , and never had a qualm of conscience or stomach till Eve seduced him into eating raw apples . "
44439	44462	44382	44384	the jovial farmer	1748	" Young man , thou'st been crossed in love . I see it now . That 's why thou look'st so sorrowful . "
44463	44486	44536	44536	he	1748	" Sorrowful ! Did you ever know a man crossed in love who looked less sorrowful when he came across a pudding ? "
44487	44507	44382	44384	the jovial farmer	1748	" Hey ! but thou canst ply a good knife and fork , that I will say for thee . "
44539	44549	44536	44536	he	1748	" Do you know that you puzzle me somewhat ? "
44550	44565	44536	44536	he	1748	" Very likely . I am sure that I puzzle myself . Say on . "
44566	44575	44536	44536	he	1748	" Looking at your dress and - and - "
44576	44586	44536	44536	he	1748	" The two shillings you gave me ? Yes - "
44587	44626	44536	44536	he	1748	" I took you for the son of some small farmer like myself . But now I judge from your talk that you are a college chap , - anyhow , a gentleman . Be n't it so ? "
44627	44739	44536	44536	he	1748	" My dear Mr. Saunderson , I set out on my travels , which is not long ago , with a strong dislike to telling lies . But I doubt if a man can get along through this world without finding that the faculty of lying was bestowed on him by Nature as a necessary means of self - preservation . If you are going to ask me any questions about myself , I am sure that I shall tell you lies . Perhaps , therefore , it may be best for both if I decline the bed you proffered me , and take my night 's rest under a hedge . "
44740	44814	44536	44536	he	1748	" Pooh ! I do n't want to know more of a man 's affairs than he thinks fit to tell me . Stay and finish the haymaking . And I say , lad , I 'm glad you do n't seem to care for the girls ; for I saw a very pretty one trying to flirt with you , and if you do n't mind she 'll bring you into trouble . "
44815	44828	44536	44536	he	1748	" How ? Does she want to run away from her uncle ? "
44829	44908	44536	44536	he	1748	" Uncle ! Bless you , she do n't live with him ! She lives with her father ; and I never knew that she wants to run away . In fact , Jessie Wiles - that 's her name - is , I believe , a very good girl , and everybody likes her , - perhaps a little too much ; but then she knows she 's a beauty , and does not object to admiration . "
44909	44938	44536	44536	he	1748	" No woman ever does , whether she 's a beauty or not . But I do n't yet understand why Jessie Wiles should bring me into trouble . "
44939	44992	44536	44536	he	1748	" Because there is a big hulking fellow who has gone half out of his wits for her ; and when he fancies he sees any other chap too sweet on her he thrashes him into a jelly . So , youngster , you just keep your skin out of that trap . "
44993	45022	44536	44536	he	1748	" Hem ! And what does the girl say to those proofs of affection ? Does she like the man the better for thrashing other admirers into jelly ? "
45023	45119	44536	44536	he	1748	" Poor child ! No ; she hates the very sight of him . But he swears she shall marry nobody else if he hangs for it . And , to tell you the truth , I suspect that if Jessie does seem to trifle with others a little too lightly , it is to draw away this bully 's suspicion from the only man I think she does care for , - a poor sickly young fellow who was crippled by an accident , and whom Tom Bowles could brain with his little finger . "
45120	45126	45128	45128	Kenelm	261	" This is really interesting , "
45135	45145	45128	45128	Kenelm	261	" I should like to know this terrible suitor . "
45146	45153	45155	45156	the farmer	1658	" That 's easy eno ' , "
45160	45192	45155	45156	the farmer	1658	" You have only to take a stroll with Jessie Wiles after sunset , and you 'll know more of Tom Bowles than you are likely to forget in a month . "
45193	45202	45204	45204	Kenelm	261	" Thank you very much for your information , "
45215	45223	45204	45204	Kenelm	261	" I hope to profit by it . "
45224	45291	45155	45156	the farmer	1658	" Do . I should be sorry if any harm came to thee ; and Tom Bowles in one of his furies is as bad to cross as a mad bull . So now , as we must be up early , I 'll just take a look round the stables , and then off to bed ; and I advise you to do the same . "
45292	45313	45204	45204	Kenelm	261	" Thank you for the hint . I see the young ladies have already gone in . Good - night . "
45325	45329	45331	45334	the Votary of Progress	1752	" I fear , "
45336	45353	45331	45334	the Votary of Progress	1752	" that you have found the governor awful slow . What have you been talking about ? "
45354	45357	45359	45359	Kenelm	261	" Girls , "
45361	45372	45359	45359	Kenelm	261	" a subject always awful , but not necessarily slow . "
45373	45387	45155	45156	the farmer	1658	" Girls , - the governor been talking about girls ? You joke . "
45388	45530	45359	45359	Kenelm	261	" I wish I did joke , but that is a thing I could never do since I came upon earth . Even in the cradle , I felt that life was a very serious matter , and did not allow of jokes . I remember too well my first dose of castor - oil . You too , Mr. Bob , have doubtless imbibed that initiatory preparation to the sweets of existence . The corners of your mouth have not recovered from the downward curves into which it so rigidly dragged them . Like myself , you are of grave temperament , and not easily moved to jocularity , - nay , an enthusiast for Progress is of necessity a man eminently dissatisfied with the present state of affairs . And chronic dissatisfaction resents the momentary relief of a joke . "
45531	45540	45542	45542	Bob	354	" Give off chaffing , if you please , "
45552	45569	45549	45549	his	354	" and just tell me plainly , did not my father say anything particular about me ? "
45570	45592	45549	45549	his	354	" Not a word : the only person of the male sex of whom he said anything particular was Tom Bowles . "
45593	45644	45549	45549	his	354	" What , fighting Tom ! the terror of the whole neighbourhood ! Ah , I guess the old gentleman is afraid lest Tom may fall foul upon me . But Jessie Wiles is not worth a quarrel with that brute . It is a crying shame in the Government - "
45645	45670	45549	45549	his	354	" What ! has the Government failed to appreciate the heroism of Tom Bowles , or rather to restrain the excesses of its ardour ? "
45671	45698	45549	45549	his	354	" Stuff ! it is a shame in the Government not to have compelled his father to put him to school . If education were universal - "
45699	45752	45549	45549	his	354	" You think there would be no brutes in particular . It may be so ; but education is universal in China , and so is the bastinado . I thought , however , that you said the schoolmaster was abroad , and that the age of enlightenment was in full progress . "
45753	45813	45549	45549	his	354	" Yes , in the towns , but not in these obsolete rural districts ; and that brings me to the point . I feel lost , thrown away here . I have something in me , sir , and it can only come out by collision with equal minds . So do me a favour , will you ? "
45814	45820	45549	45549	his	354	" With the greatest pleasure . "
45821	45858	45549	45549	his	354	" Give the governor a hint that he ca n't expect me , after the education I have had , to follow the plough and fatten pigs ; and that Manchester is the place for ME . "
45859	45863	45549	45549	his	354	" Why Manchester ? "
45864	45890	45549	45549	his	354	" Because I have a relation in business there who will give me a clerkship if the governor will consent . And Manchester rules England . "
45891	46143	45549	45549	his	354	" Mr. Bob Saunderson , I will do my best to promote your wishes . This is a land of liberty , and every man should choose his own walk in it , so that , at the last , if he goes to the dogs , he goes to them without that disturbance of temper which is naturally occasioned by the sense of being driven to their jaws by another man against his own will . He has then no one to blame but himself . And that , Mr. Bob , is a great comfort . When , having got into a scrape , we blame others , we unconsciously become unjust , spiteful , uncharitable , malignant , perhaps revengeful . We indulge in feelings which tend to demoralize the whole character . But when we only blame ourselves , we become modest and penitent . We make allowances for others . And indeed self - blame is a salutary exercise of conscience , which a really good man performs every day of his life . And now , will you show me the room in which I am to sleep , and forget for a few hours that I am alive at all : the best thing that can happen to us in this world , my dear Mr. Bob ! There 's never much amiss with our days , so long as we can forget about them the moment we lay our heads on the pillow . "
46307	46318	46302	46302	he	261	" I fear I shall have to lick Thomas Bowles . "
46402	46421	46385	46385	he	261	" I am afraid I was rather rude to you yesterday , and I want to beg pardon . "
46422	46425	46427	46428	the girl	1594	" Oh , "
46454	46485	46427	46428	the girl	1594	" oh , I ought to ask pardon for taking a liberty in speaking to you . But I thought you 'd feel strange , and I intended it kindly . "
46486	46493	46495	46495	Kenelm	261	" I 'm sure you did , "
46513	46581	46495	46495	Kenelm	261	" And I want to be good friends with you . It is very near the time when we shall leave off for dinner , and Mrs. Saunderson has filled my pockets with some excellent beef - sandwiches , which I shall be happy to share with you , if you do not object to dine with me here , instead of going home for your dinner . "
46597	46609	46589	46589	her	1594	" Are you afraid that your neighbours will think it wrong ? "
46623	46640	46613	46613	her	358	" I do n't much care what other folks say , but is n't it wrong ? "
46641	46692	46694	46694	he	1766	" Not in the least . Let me make your mind easy . I am here but for a day or two : we are not likely ever to meet again ; but , before I go , I should be glad if I could do you some little service . "
46941	46944	46945	46945	he	1766	" Certainly , "
46949	46967	46945	46945	he	1766	" certainly I must lick Tom Bowles ; yet stay , perhaps after all she likes him . "
46968	46971	46972	46972	he	1766	" But , "
46976	47009	46972	46972	he	1766	" you do not see how I can be of any service to you . Before I explain , let me ask which of the men in the field is Tom Bowles ? "
47010	47014	47016	47016	Jessie	358	" Tom Bowles ? "
47035	47066	47030	47030	she	358	" you frightened me , sir : but he is not here ; he does not work in the fields . But how came you to hear of Tom Bowles ? "
47067	47126	46972	46972	he	1766	" Dine with me and I 'll tell you . Look , there is a quiet place in yon corner under the thorn - trees by that piece of water . See , they are leaving off work : I will go for a can of beer , and then , pray , let me join you there . "
47258	47262	47264	47264	Kenelm	261	" AND now , "
47311	47347	47799	47799	Kenelm	261	" now I will talk to you about Tom Bowles . Is it true that you do n't like that brave young fellow ? I say young , as I take his youth for granted . "
47348	47359	47799	47799	Kenelm	261	" Like him ! I hate the sight of him . "
47360	47386	47799	47799	Kenelm	261	" Did you always hate the sight of him ? You must surely at one time have allowed him to think that you did not ? "
47411	47430	47432	47432	Kenelm	261	" I am afraid you like to serve your admirers as you do that ill - fated flower , "
47440	47486	47432	47432	Kenelm	261	" But concealed in the flower you may sometimes find the sting of a bee . I see by your countenance that you did not tell Tom Bowles that you hated him till it was too late to prevent his losing his wits for you . "
47487	47498	47500	47500	Jessie	358	" No ; I was n't so bad as that , "
47511	47617	47500	47500	Jessie	358	" but I was silly and giddy - like , I own ; and , when he first took notice of me , I was pleased , without thinking much of it , because , you see , Mr. Bowles emphasis on Mr. is higher up than a poor girl like me . He is a tradesman , and I am only a shepherd 's daughter ; though , indeed , Father is more like Mr. Saunderson 's foreman than a mere shepherd . But I never thought anything serious of it , and did not suppose he did ; that is , at first . "
47618	47629	47432	47432	Kenelm	261	" So Tom Bowles is a tradesman . What trade ? "
47630	47636	47500	47500	Jessie	358	" A farrier , sir . "
47637	47650	47432	47432	Kenelm	261	" And , I am told , a very fine young man . "
47651	47665	47500	47500	Jessie	358	" I do n't know as to that : he is very big . "
47666	47674	47432	47432	Kenelm	261	" And what made you hate him ? "
47675	47793	47500	47500	Jessie	358	" The first thing that made me hate him was that he insulted Father , who is a very quiet , timid man , and threatened I do n't know what if Father did not make me keep company with him . Make me indeed ! But Mr. Bowles is a dangerous , bad - hearted , violent man , and - do n't laugh at me , sir , but I dreamed one night he was murdering me . And I think he will too , if he stays here : and so does his poor mother , who is a very nice woman , and wants him to go away ; but he will not . "
47794	47797	47799	47799	Kenelm	261	" Jessie , "
47803	47848	47799	47799	Kenelm	261	" I said I wanted to make friends with you . Do you think you can make a friend of me ? I can never be more than friend . But I should like to be that . Can you trust me as one ? "
47849	47852	47854	47855	the girl	1594	" Yes , "
47886	47916	47950	47950	Kenelm	261	" Is there not another young man who courts you more civilly than Tom Bowles does , and whom you really could find it in your heart to like ? "
48035	48040	48024	48024	we	1791	" Happy young lovers ! "
48142	48191	48138	48138	he	261	" I see there is some one you would like well enough to marry , and that you make a great difference in the way you treat a daffodil and a bluebell . Who and what is the young man whom the bluebell represents ? Come , confide . "
48192	48200	48202	48202	Jessie	358	" We were much brought up together , "
48217	48263	48202	48202	Jessie	358	" His mother lived in the next cottage ; and my mother was very fond of him , and so was Father too ; and , before I was ten years old , they used to laugh when poor Will called me his little wife . "
48281	48319	48202	48202	Jessie	358	" But now Father would not hear of it ; and it ca n't be . And I 've tried to care for some one else , and I ca n't , and that 's the truth . "
48320	48337	48202	48202	Jessie	358	" But why ? Has he turned out ill ? - taken to poaching or drink ? "
48338	48361	48202	48202	Jessie	358	" No , no , no ; he 's as steady and good a lad as ever lived . But - but - "
48362	48367	48202	48202	Jessie	358	" Yes ; but - "
48368	48385	48202	48202	Jessie	358	" He is a cripple now ; and I love him all the better for it . "
48610	48613	48615	48615	Jessie	358	" And , "
48701	48701	48679	48679	Will	362	"
48702	48742	48670	48670	he	359	" As for Mr. Bowles , we 'll not think of him at present . But if Will could maintain himself and you , your father would not object nor you either to a marriage with the poor cripple ? "
48743	48773	48679	48679	Will	362	" Father would not ; and as for me , if it were n't for disobeying Father , I 'd marry him to - morrow . I can work . "
48774	48812	48670	48670	he	359	" They are going back to the hay now ; but after that task is over , let me walk home with you , and show me Will 's cottage and Mr. Bowles 's shop or forge . "
48813	48858	48679	48679	Will	362	" But you 'll not say anything to Mr. Bowles . He would n't mind your being a gentleman , as I now see you are , sir ; and he 's dangerous , - oh , so dangerous ! - and so strong . "
48859	48863	48865	48865	Kenelm	261	" Never fear , "
48881	48898	48874	48874	he	261	" but when we are relieved , wait for me a few minutes at yon gate . "
49128	49135	49137	49137	Kenelm	261	" Who is the Squire here ? "
49139	49156	49137	49137	Kenelm	261	" I should guess him to be a good sort of man , and well off . "
49157	49237	49239	49239	Jessie	358	" Yes , Squire Travers ; he is a great gentleman , and they say very rich . But his place is a good way from this village . You can see it if you stay , for he gives a harvest - home supper on Saturday , and Mr. Saunderson and all his tenants are going . It is a beautiful park , and Miss Travers is a sight to look at . Oh , she is lovely ! "
49268	49274	49137	49137	Kenelm	261	" As pretty as yourself ? "
49275	49291	49137	49137	Kenelm	261	" Oh , pretty is not the word . She is a thousand times handsomer ! "
49292	49295	49297	49297	Kenelm	261	" Humph ! "
49314	49325	49312	49312	Jessie	358	" What are you sighing for ? - tell me . "
49326	49364	49137	49137	Kenelm	261	" I was thinking that a very little can make folks happy , but that somehow or other that very little is as hard to get as if one set one 's heart on a great deal . "
49365	49402	49312	49312	Jessie	358	" That 's very wisely said . Everybody covets a little something for which , perhaps , nobody else would give a straw . But what 's the very little thing for which you are sighing ? "
49403	49454	49137	49137	Kenelm	261	" Mrs. Bawtrey wants to sell that shop of hers . She is getting old , and has had fits ; and she can get nobody to buy ; and if Will had that shop and I could keep it , - but ' tis no use thinking of that . "
49455	49462	49312	49312	Jessie	358	" What shop do you mean ? "
49463	49466	49137	49137	Kenelm	261	" There ! "
49467	49475	49312	49312	Jessie	358	" Where ? I see no shop . "
49476	49499	49137	49137	Kenelm	261	" But it is the shop of the village , - the only one , - where the post - office is . "
49500	49519	49312	49312	Jessie	358	" Ah ! I see something at the windows like a red cloak . What do they sell ? "
49520	49565	49137	49137	Kenelm	261	" Everything , - tea and sugar and candles and shawls and gowns and cloaks and mouse - traps and letter - paper ; and Mrs. Bawtrey buys poor Will 's baskets , and sells them for a good deal more than she pays . "
49566	49582	49312	49312	Jessie	358	" It seems a nice cottage , with a field and orchard at the back . "
49583	49603	49137	49137	Kenelm	261	" Yes . Mrs. Bawtrey pays L8 a year for it ; but the shop can well afford it . "
49710	49716	49718	49718	Jessie	358	" It is Tom Bowles , "
49749	49758	49722	49722	she	358	" Go back now , sir ; do . "
49759	49774	49782	49782	his	359	" Not I. It is Tom Bowles whom I want to know . Hush ! "
49986	49991	49961	49961	he	359	" Who be you ? "
49992	50003	49961	49961	he	359	" Let go that young woman before I tell you . "
50004	50012	50014	50014	Bowles	359	" If you were n't a stranger , "
50029	50077	50019	50019	he	359	" you 'd be in the kennel for those words . But I s'pose you do n't know that I 'm Tom Bowles , and I do n't choose the girl as I 'm after to keep company with any other man . So you be off . "
50078	50135	50157	50157	his	359	" And I do n't choose any other man to lay violent hands on any girl walking by my side without telling him that he 's a brute ; and that I only wait till he has both his hands at liberty to let him know that he has not a poor cripple to deal with . "
50339	50348	50332	50332	Kenelm	261	" Thou'lt find one hand enough for thee . "
50581	50629	50578	50578	himself	359	" Oh , that 's your sort , is it ? We do n't fight with our heels hereabouts , like Cornishers and donkeys : we fight with our fists , youngster ; and since you will have a bout at that , why , you must . "
50630	50633	50635	50635	Kenelm	261	" Providence , "
50670	50670	50635	50635	Kenelm	261	"
50887	51053	50873	50873	Kenelm	261	" Stand round , my good friends , make a ring , and see that it is fair play on my side . I am sure it will be fair on Mr. Bowles 's . He is big enough to scorn what is little . And now , Mr. Bowles , just a word with you in the presence of your neighbours . I am not going to say anything uncivil . If you are rather rough and hasty , a man is not always master of himself - at least so I am told - when he thinks more than he ought to do about a pretty girl . But I ca n't look at your face even by this moonlight , and though its expression at this moment is rather cross , without being sure that you are a fine fellow at bottom , and that if you give a promise as man to man you will keep it . Is that so ? "
51071	51081	51083	51084	Tom Bowles	359	" What 's all that soft - sawder about ? "
51089	51128	51268	51269	the bystanders	1869	" Simply this : if in the fight between us I beat you , I ask you to promise before your neighbours that you will not by word or deed molest or interfere again with Miss Jessie Wiles . "
51129	51132	51134	51134	Tom	359	" Eh ! "
51136	51145	51134	51134	Tom	359	" Is it that you are after her ? "
51146	51209	51268	51269	the bystanders	1869	" Suppose I am , if that pleases you ; and on my side , I promise that if you beat me , I quit this place as soon as you leave me well enough to do so , and will never visit it again . What ! do you hesitate to promise ? Are you really afraid I shall lick you ? "
51210	51223	51134	51134	Tom	359	" You ! I 'd smash a dozen of you to powder . "
51224	51249	51268	51269	the bystanders	1869	" In that case , you are safe to promise . Come , ' tis a fair bargain . Is n't it , neighbours ? "
51278	51283	51285	51287	an old fellow	1872	" Come , Tom , "
51289	51310	51285	51287	an old fellow	1872	" the gentleman ca n't speak fairer ; and we shall all think you be afeard if you hold back . "
51322	51336	51319	51319	he	359	" Well , I promise ; that is , if he beats me . "
51337	51341	51343	51343	Kenelm	261	" All right , "
51345	51375	51343	51343	Kenelm	261	" You hear , neighbours ; and Tom Bowles could not show that handsome face of his among you if he broke his word . Shake hands on it . "
51382	51393	51395	51395	Kenelm	261	" Well now , that 's what I call English , "
51397	51417	51395	51395	Kenelm	261	" all pluck and no malice . Fall back , friends , and leave a clear space for us . "

52050	52066	52040	52040	he	261	" He has a handsome face : it would be a shame to spoil it . "
52532	52614	52505	52505	his	261	" If he had been a less magnificent creature , I assure you on my honour that I should never have ventured that second blow . The first would have done for any man less splendidly endowed by nature . Lift him gently ; take him home . Tell his mother , with my kind regards , that I 'll call and see her and him to - morrow . And , stop , does he ever drink too much beer ? "
52615	52618	52620	52623	one of the villagers	1912	" Well , "
52625	52630	52620	52623	one of the villagers	1912	" Tom can drink . "
52631	52676	52505	52505	his	261	" I thought so . Too much flesh for that muscle . Go for the nearest doctor . You , my lad ? good ; off with you ; quick . No danger , but perhaps it may be a case for the lancet . "
52745	52758	52742	52742	Jessie	358	" Now , my young friend , show me Will 's cottage . "
52906	52972	52890	52890	Kenelm	261	" Mr. Bowles has given me his promise , and it is fair that I should now ask a promise from you . It is this : just consider how easily a girl so pretty as you can be the cause of a man 's death . Had Bowles struck me where I struck him I should have been past the help of a surgeon . "
52973	52976	52978	52978	Jessie	358	" Oh ! "
52990	53100	52890	52890	Kenelm	261	" And , putting aside that danger , consider that a man may be hit mortally on the heart as well as on the head , and that a woman has much to answer for who , no matter what her excuse , forgets what misery and what guilt can be inflicted by a word from her lip and a glance from her eye . Consider this , and promise that , whether you marry Will Somers or not , you will never again give a man fair cause to think you can like him unless your own heart tells you that you can . Will you promise that ? "
53101	53110	53111	53112	Poor Jessie	370	" I will , indeed , - indeed . "
53119	53173	52890	52890	Kenelm	261	" There , my child , I do n't ask you not to cry , because I know how much women like crying ; and in this instance it does you a great deal of good . But we are just at the end of the village ; which is Will 's cottage ? "
53189	53229	53176	53176	her	370	" I would ask you to come in and introduce me ; but that might look too much like crowing over poor Tom Bowles . So good - night to you , Jessie , and forgive me for preaching . "
53245	53249	53233	53233	KENELM	261	" Come in . "
53692	53728	53682	53682	Kenelm	261	" I am among simple English peasants ; but , for some reason or other , not to be explained by the relative amount of wages , it is a favourable specimen of that class . "
53729	53743	53745	53745	Kenelm	261	" I beg your pardon for intruding at this hour , Mrs. Somers , "
53787	53821	53745	53745	Kenelm	261	" But my stay in the village is very short , and I should not like to leave without seeing your son 's basket - work , of which I have heard much . "
53822	53830	53832	53832	Will	362	" You are very good , sir , "
53845	53871	53832	53832	Will	362	" It is only just a few common things that I keep by me . Any finer sort of work I mostly do by order . "
53872	53878	53880	53881	Mrs. Somers	371	" You see , sir , "
53883	53925	53880	53881	Mrs. Somers	371	" it takes so much more time for pretty work - baskets , and such like ; and unless done to order , it might be a chance if he could get it sold . But pray be seated , sir , "
53936	53976	53927	53928	Mrs. Somers	371	" while I just run up stairs for the work - basket which my son has made for Miss Travers . It is to go home to - morrow , and I put it away for fear of accidents . "
54009	54020	54022	54022	Kenelm	261	" This seems to me very nice and delicate workmanship , "
54024	54047	54022	54022	Kenelm	261	" and the shape , when you have finished it , will be elegant enough to please the taste of a lady . "
54048	54055	54057	54057	Will	362	" It is for Mrs. Lethbridge , "
54100	54100	54093	54093	He	373	"
54101	54114	54088	54089	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" No , I do n't know him . Who is he ? "
54115	54126	54093	54093	He	373	" Our clergyman , sir . This is the book . "
54159	54167	54169	54169	Kenelm	261	" I see this is your model , "
54171	54238	54169	54169	Kenelm	261	" what they call a patera , and rather a famous one . You are copying it much more truthfully than I should have supposed it possible to do in substituting basket - work for bronze . But you observe that much of the beauty of this shallow bowl depends on the two doves perched on the brim . You ca n't manage that ornamental addition . "
54239	54253	54088	54089	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" Mrs. Lethbridge thought of putting there two little stuffed canary - birds . "
54254	54261	54263	54263	Kenelm	261	" Did she ? Good heavens ! "
54265	54269	54271	54271	Will	362	" But somehow , "
54273	54288	54271	54271	Will	362	" I did not like that , and I made bold to say so . "
54289	54297	54088	54089	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" Why did not you do it ? "
54298	54318	54271	54271	Will	362	" Well , I do n't know ; but I did not think it would be the right thing . "
54319	54547	54088	54089	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" It would have been very bad taste , and spoiled the effect of your basket - work ; and I 'll endeavour to explain why . You see here , in the next page , a drawing of a very beautiful statue . Of course this statue is intended to be a representation of nature , but nature idealized . You do n't know the meaning of that hard word , idealized , and very few people do . But it means the performance of a something in art according to the idea which a man 's mind forms to itself out of a something in nature . That something in nature must , of course , have been carefully studied before the man can work out anything in art by which it is faithfully represented . The artist , for instance , who made that statue , must have known the proportions of the human frame . He must have made studies of various parts of it , - heads and hands , and arms and legs , and so forth , - and having done so , he then puts together all his various studies of details , so as to form a new whole , which is intended to personate an idea formed in his own mind . Do you go with me ? "
54548	54561	54271	54271	Will	362	" Partly , sir ; but I am puzzled a little still . "
54562	54814	54088	54089	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" Of course you are ; but you 'll puzzle yourself right if you think over what I say . Now if , in order to make this statue , which is composed of metal or stone , more natural , I stuck on it a wig of real hair , would not you feel at once that I had spoilt the work ; that as you clearly express it , ' it would not be the right thing ' ? and instead of making the work of art more natural , I should have made it laughably unnatural , by forcing insensibly upon the mind of him who looked at it the contrast between the real life , represented by a wig of actual hair , and the artistic life , represented by an idea embodied in stone or metal . The higher the work of art that is , the higher the idea it represents as a new combination of details taken from nature , the more it is degraded or spoilt by an attempt to give it a kind of reality which is out of keeping with the materials employed . But the same rule applies to everything in art , however humble . And a couple of stuffed canary - birds at the brim of a basket - work imitation of a Greek drinking - cup would be as bad taste as a wig from the barber 's on the head of a marble statue of Apollo . "
54815	54819	54821	54821	Will	362	" I see , "
54833	54852	54828	54829	a man	5498	" at least I think I see ; and I 'm very much obliged to you , sir . "
55014	55032	55034	55035	Mrs. Somers	371	" The young lady means to finish it herself with ribbons , and line it with satin , "
55039	55049	55051	55051	Will	362	" The ribbons will not be amiss , sir ? "
55055	55191	55235	55236	Mrs. Somers	371	" Not at all . Your natural sense of the fitness of things tells you that ribbons go well with straw and light straw - like work such as this ; though you would not put ribbons on those rude hampers and game - baskets in the corner . Like to like ; a stout cord goes suitably with them : just as a poet who understands his art employs pretty expressions for poems intended to be pretty and suit a fashionable drawing - room , and carefully shuns them to substitute a simple cord for poems intended to be strong and travel far , despite of rough usage by the way . But you really ought to make much more money by this fancy - work than you could as a day - labourer . "
55195	55209	55192	55192	Will	362	" Not in this neighbourhood , sir ; I might in a town . "
55210	55220	55235	55236	Mrs. Somers	371	" Why not move to a town , then ? "
55238	55258	55261	55261	she	371	" I 'll be willing to go wherever it would be best for my boy , sir . But - "
55283	55302	55274	55274	Will	362	" I am getting a little known now , and work will come if one waits for it . "
55481	55505	55473	55475	that philosophical vagrant	1965	" If I am not mistaken , sir , you are the doctor . There is not much the matter with Mr. Bowles ? "
55512	55528	55506	55507	The doctor	5702	" I ca n't say yet . He has had a very ugly blow somewhere . "
55529	55633	55509	55509	his	5702	" It was just under the left ear . I did not aim at that exact spot : but Bowles unluckily swerved a little aside at the moment , perhaps in surprise at a tap between his eyes immediately preceding it : and so , as you say , it was an ugly blow that he received . But if it cures him of the habit of giving ugly blows to other people who can bear them less safely , perhaps it may be all for his good , as , no doubt , sir , your schoolmaster said when he flogged you . "
55634	55657	55506	55507	The doctor	5702	" Bless my soul ! are you the man who fought with him , - you ? I ca n't believe it . "
55658	55662	55509	55509	his	5702	" Why not ? "
55663	55696	55506	55507	The doctor	5702	" Why not ! So far as I can judge by this light , though you are a tall fellow , Tom Bowles must be a much heavier weight than you are . "
55697	55733	55509	55509	his	5702	" Tom Spring was the champion of England ; and according to the records of his weight , which history has preserved in her archives , Tom Spring was a lighter weight than I am . "
55734	55743	55506	55507	The doctor	5702	" But are you a prize - fighter ? "
55744	55770	55509	55509	his	5702	" I am as much that as I am anything else . But to return to Mr. Bowles , was it necessary to bleed him ? "
55771	55811	55506	55507	The doctor	5702	" Yes ; he was unconscious , or nearly so , when I came . I took away a few ounces ; and I am happy to say he is now sensible , but must be kept very quiet . "
55812	55831	55509	55509	his	5702	" No doubt ; but I hope he will be well enough to see me to - morrow . "
55832	55853	55506	55507	The doctor	5702	" I hope so too ; but I ca n't say yet . Quarrel about a girl , - eh ? "
55854	55892	55509	55509	his	5702	" It was not about money . And I suppose if there were no money and no women in the world , there would be no quarrels and very few doctors . Good - night , Sir . "
55893	55902	55907	55907	he	261	" It is a strange thing to me , "
55920	55972	55907	55907	he	261	" that though I 've had nothing to eat all day , except a few pitiful sandwiches , I do n't feel the least hungry . Such arrest of the lawful duties of the digestive organs never happened to me before . There must be something weird and ominous in it . "
56040	56080	56027	56029	the hearty farmer	1970	" But I have lost my appetite ! No honours can compensate for that . Let me go to bed peaceably , and perhaps in the magic land of sleep Nature may restore me by a dream of supper . "
56421	56431	56432	56432	she	1979	" You be n't thinking of it for yourself ? "
56446	56473	56432	56432	she	1979	" Perhaps so , if one could get a decent living out of it . Do you keep a book of your losses and your gains ? "
56474	56480	56481	56481	she	1979	" In course , sir , "
56485	56524	56481	56481	she	1979	" I kept the books in my goodman 's time , and he was one who could find out if there was a farthing wrong , for he had been in a lawyer 's office when a lad . "
56525	56540	56432	56432	she	1979	" Why did he leave a lawyer 's office to keep a little shop ? "
56541	56571	56481	56481	she	1979	" Well , he was born a farmer 's son in this neighbourhood , and he always had a hankering after the country , and - and besides that - "
56572	56575	56432	56432	she	1979	" Yes . "
56576	56808	56481	56481	she	1979	" I 'll tell you the truth ; he had got into a way of drinking speerrits , and he was a good young man , and wanted to break himself of it , and he took the temperance oath ; but it was too hard on him , for he could not break himself of the company that led him into liquor . And so , one time when he came into the neighbourhood to see his parents for the Christmas holiday , he took a bit of liking to me ; and my father , who was Squire Travers 's bailiff , had just died , and left me a little money . And so , somehow or other , we came together , and got this house and the land from the Squire on lease very reasonable ; and my goodman being well eddyeated , and much thought of , and never being tempted to drink , now that he had a missis to keep him in order , had a many little things put into his way . He could help to measure timber , and knew about draining , and he got some bookkeeping from the farmers about ; and we kept cows and pigs and poultry , and so we did very well , specially as the Lord was merciful and sent us no children . "
56809	56824	56432	56432	she	1979	" And what does the shop bring in a year since your husband died ? "
56825	56862	56481	56481	she	1979	" You had best judge for yourself . Will you look at the book , and take a peep at the land and apple - trees ? But they 's been neglected since my goodman died . "
57309	57315	57316	57316	she	2010	" What 's your pleasure ? "
57327	57330	57332	57332	Kenelm	261	" Ma'am , "
57336	57359	57332	57332	Kenelm	261	" I have called to see Mr. Bowles , and I sincerely hope he is well enough to let me do so . "
57360	57388	57316	57316	she	2010	" No , sir , he is not well enough for that ; he is lying down in his own room , and must be kept quiet . "
57389	57420	57421	57422	Mrs. Bowles	378	" May I then ask you the favour to let me in ? I would say a few words to you , who are his mother if I mistake not . "
57506	57509	57511	57511	Kenelm	261	" Ma'am , "
57513	57545	57511	57511	Kenelm	261	" do not regret to have admitted me , and do not think hardly of me when I inform you that I am the unfortunate cause of your son 's accident . "
57553	57563	57546	57547	Mrs. Bowles	378	" You 're the man who beat my boy ? "
57564	57632	57633	57634	Mrs. Bowles	378	" No , ma'am , do not say I beat him . He is not beaten . He is so brave and so strong that he would easily have beaten me if I had not , by good luck , knocked him down before he had time to do so . Pray , ma'am , retain your seat and listen to me patiently for a few moments . "
57666	57673	57675	57675	Kenelm	261	" You will allow , ma'am , "
57677	57706	57675	57675	Kenelm	261	" that this is not the first time by many that Mr. Bowles has come to blows with another man . Am I not right in that assumption ? "
57707	57715	57717	57718	Mrs. Bowles	378	" My son is of hasty temper , "
57722	57730	57717	57718	Mrs. Bowles	378	" and people should not aggravate him . "
57731	57739	57741	57741	Kenelm	261	" You grant the fact , then ? "
57753	57858	57741	57741	Kenelm	261	" Mr. Bowles has often been engaged in these encounters , and in all of them it is quite clear that he provoked the battle ; for you must be aware that he is not the sort of man to whom any other would be disposed to give the first blow . Yet , after these little incidents had occurred , and Mr. Bowles had , say , half killed the person who aggravated him , you did not feel any resentment against that person , did you ? Nay , if he had wanted nursing , you would have gone and nursed him . "
57859	57868	57870	57871	Mrs. Bowles	378	" I do n't know as to nursing , "
57881	57936	57876	57876	her	378	" but certainly I should have been very sorry for him . And as for Tom , - though I say it who should not say , - he has no more malice than a baby : he 'd go and make it up with any man , however badly he had beaten him . "
57937	57973	57741	57741	Kenelm	261	" Just as I supposed ; and if the man had sulked and would not make it up , Tom would have called him a bad fellow , and felt inclined to beat him again . "
57984	57989	57991	57991	Kenelm	261	" Well , then , "
57993	58015	57991	57991	Kenelm	261	" I do but humbly imitate Mr. Bowles , and I come to make it up and shake hands with him . "
58016	58024	58026	58027	Mrs. Bowles	378	" No , sir , - no , "
58039	58101	58026	58027	Mrs. Bowles	378	" Do n't think of it . ' Tis not the blows ; he 'll get over those fast enough : ' tis his pride that 's hurt ; and if he saw you there might be mischief . But you 're a stranger , and going away : do go soon ; do keep out of his way ; do ! "
58109	58113	58115	58115	Kenelm	261	" Mrs. Bowles , "
58142	58211	58115	58115	Kenelm	261	" will you not help me to save your son from the dangers into which that hasty temper and that mischievous pride may at any moment hurry him ? Does it never occur to you that these are the causes of terrible crime , bringing terrible punishment ; and that against brute force , impelled by savage passions , society protects itself by the hulks and the gallows ? "
58212	58219	58115	58115	Kenelm	261	" Sir ; how dare you - "
58220	58331	58115	58115	Kenelm	261	" Hush ! If one man kill another in a moment of ungovernable wrath , that is a crime which , though heavily punished by the conscience , is gently dealt with by the law , which calls it only manslaughter ; but if a motive to the violence , such as jealousy or revenge , can be assigned , and there should be no witness by to prove that the violence was not premeditated , then the law does not call it manslaughter , but murder . Was it not that thought which made you so imploringly exclaim , ' Go soon ; keep out of his way ' ? "
58350	58355	58357	58357	Kenelm	261	" Nay , madam , "
58361	58414	58357	58357	Kenelm	261	" banish your fears . If you will help me I feel sure that I can save your son from such perils , and I only ask you to let me save him . I am convinced that he has a good and a noble nature , and he is worth saving . "
58457	58495	58453	58453	she	1941	" It is all along of that girl . He was not so till she crossed him , and made him half mad . He is not the same man since then , - my poor Tom ! "
58496	58532	58453	58453	she	1941	" Do you know that he has given me his word , and before his fellow - villagers , that if he had the worst of the fight he would never molest Jessie Wiles again ? "
58533	58589	58453	58453	she	1941	" Yes , he told me so himself ; and it is that which weighs on him now . He broods and broods and mutters , and will not be comforted ; and - and I do fear that he means revenge . And again , I implore you to keep out of his way . "
58590	58626	58453	58453	she	1941	" It is not revenge on me that he thinks of . Suppose I go and am seen no more , do you think in your own heart that that girl 's life is safe ? "
58627	58636	58453	58453	she	1941	" What ! My Tom kill a woman ! "
58637	58715	58453	58453	she	1941	" Do you never read in your newspaper of a man who kills his sweetheart , or the girl who refuses to be his sweetheart ? At all events , you yourself do not approve this frantic suit of his . If I have heard rightly , you have wished to get Tom out of the village for some time , till Jessie Wiles is - we 'll say , married , or gone elsewhere for good . "
58716	58853	58453	58453	she	1941	" Yes , indeed , I have wished and prayed for it many 's the time , both for her sake and for his . And I am sure I do n't know what we shall do if he stays , for he has been losing custom fast . The Squire has taken away his , and so have many of the farmers ; and such a trade as it was in his good father 's time ! And if he would go , his uncle , the veterinary at Luscombe , would take him into partnership ; for he has no son of his own , and he knows how clever Tom is : there be n't a man who knows more about horses ; and cows , too , for the matter of that . "
58854	58884	58453	58453	she	1941	" And if Luscombe is a large place , the business there must be more profitable than it can be here , even if Tom got back his custom ? "
58885	58909	58453	58453	she	1941	" Oh yes ! five times as good , - if he would but go ; but he 'll not hear of it . "
58910	58964	58453	58453	she	1941	" Mrs. Bowles , I am very much obliged to you for your confidence , and I feel sure that all will end happily now we have had this talk . I 'll not press further on you at present . Tom will not stir out , I suppose , till the evening . "
58965	58988	58453	58453	she	1941	" Ah , sir , he seems as if he had no heart to stir out again , unless for something dreadful . "
58989	59039	58453	58453	she	1941	" Courage ! I will call again in the evening , and then you just take me up to Tom 's room , and leave me there to make friends with him , as I have with you . Do n't say a word about me in the meanwhile . "
59040	59043	58453	58453	she	1941	" But - "
59044	59105	58453	58453	she	1941	" ' But , ' Mrs. Bowles , is a word that cools many a warm impulse , stifles many a kindly thought , puts a dead stop to many a brotherly deed . Nobody would ever love his neighbour as himself if he listened to all the Buts that could be said on the other side of the question . "
59144	59154	59138	59138	he	261	" Have I the honour to address Mr. Lethbridge ? "
59155	59161	59163	59164	the clergyman	2019	" That is my name , "
59169	59177	59163	59164	the clergyman	2019	" Anything I can do for you ? "
59178	59200	59138	59138	he	261	" Yes , a great deal , if you will let me talk to you about a few of your parishioners . "
59201	59229	59163	59164	the clergyman	2019	" My parishioners ! I beg your pardon , but you are quite a stranger to me , and , I should think , to the parish . "
59230	59268	59138	59138	he	261	" To the parish , - no , I am quite at home in it ; and I honestly believe that it has never known a more officious busybody , thrusting himself into its most private affairs . "
59282	59314	59269	59270	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" I have heard of a young man who has been staying at Mr. Saunderson 's , and is indeed at this moment the talk of the village . You are - "
59315	59324	59138	59138	he	261	" That young man . Alas ! yes . "
59325	59328	59330	59331	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" Nay , "
59335	59476	59330	59331	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" I can not myself , as a minister of the Gospel , approve of your profession , and , if I might take the liberty , I would try and dissuade you from it ; but still , as for the one act of freeing a poor girl from the most scandalous persecution , and administering , though in a rough way , a lesson to a savage brute who has long been the disgrace and terror of the neighbourhood , I can not honestly say that it has my condemnation . The moral sense of a community is generally a right one : you have won the praise of the village . Under all the circumstances , I do not withhold mine . You woke this morning and found yourself famous . Do not sigh ' Alas . ' "
59477	59529	59138	59138	he	261	" Lord Byron woke one morning and found himself famous , and the result was that he sighed ' Alas ' for the rest of his life . If there be two things which a wise man should avoid , they are fame and love . Heaven defend me from both ! "
59566	59688	59554	59554	he	908	" I have always heard that the Americans in general enjoy the advantage of a better education than we do in England , and their reading public is infinitely larger than ours ; still , when I hear one of a calling not highly considered in this country for intellectual cultivation or ethical philosophy cite Lord Byron , and utter a sentiment at variance with the impetuosity of inexperienced youth , but which has much to commend it in the eyes of a reflective Christian impressed with the nothingness of the objects mostly coveted by the human heart , I am surprised , and - oh , my dear young friend , surely your education might fit you for something better ! "
59722	59726	59713	59713	he	1276	" taken aback , "
59741	59747	59729	59729	himself	1276	" I do n't understand . "
59748	59752	59754	59755	the clergyman	2019	" I see , "
59762	59866	59758	59758	his	2019	" as I always suspected , that in the vaunted education bestowed on Americans , the elementary principles of Christian right and wrong are more neglected than they are among our own humble classes . Yes , my young friend , you may quote poets , you may startle me by remarks on the nothingness of human fame and human love , derived from the precepts of heathen poets , and yet not understand with what compassion , and , in the judgment of most sober - minded persons , with what contempt , a human being who practises your vocation is regarded . "
59867	59873	59875	59875	Kenelm	261	" Have I a vocation ? "
59877	59899	59875	59875	Kenelm	261	" I am very glad to hear it . What is my vocation ? And why must I be an American ? "
59900	59979	59758	59758	his	2019	" Why , surely I am not misinformed ? You are the American - I forget his name - who has come over to contest the belt of prize - fighting with the champion of England . You are silent ; you hang your head . By your appearance , your length of limb , your gravity of countenance , your evident education , you confirm the impression of your birth . Your prowess has proved your profession . "
59980	59984	59986	59986	Kenelm	261	" Reverend sir , "
59995	60170	59989	59989	his	261	" I am on my travels in search of truth and in flight from shams , but so great a take - in as myself I have not yet encountered . Remember me in your prayers . I am not an American ; I am not a prize - fighter . I honour the first as the citizen of a grand republic trying his best to accomplish an experiment in government in which he will find the very prosperity he tends to create will sooner or later destroy his experiment . I honour the last because strength , courage , and sobriety are essential to the prize - fighter , and are among the chiefest ornaments of kings and heroes . But I am neither one nor the other . And all I can say for myself is , that I belong to that very vague class commonly called English gentlemen , and that , by birth and education , I have a right to ask you to shake hands with me as such . "
60186	60251	59758	59758	his	2019	" You will allow me now to speak to you about your parishioners . You take an interest in Will Somers ; so do I. He is clever and ingenious . But it seems there is not sufficient demand here for his baskets , and he would , no doubt , do better in some neighbouring town . Why does he object to move ? "
60252	60282	59758	59758	his	2019	" I fear that poor Will would pine away to death if he lost sight of that pretty girl for whom you did such chivalrous battle with Tom Bowles . "
60283	60310	59758	59758	his	2019	" The unhappy man , then , is really in love with Jessie Wiles ? And do you think she no less really cares for him ? "
60311	60318	59758	59758	his	2019	" I am sure of it . "
60319	60335	59758	59758	his	2019	" And would make him a good wife ; that is , as wives go ? "
60336	60409	59758	59758	his	2019	" A good daughter generally makes a good wife . And there is not a father in the place who has a better child than Jessie is to hers . She really is a girl of a superior nature . She was the cleverest pupil at our school , and my wife is much attached to her . But she has something better than mere cleverness : she has an excellent heart . "
60410	60444	59758	59758	his	2019	" What you say confirms my own impressions . And the girl 's father has no other objection to Will Somers than his fear that Will could not support a wife and family comfortably .
60445	60487	59758	59758	his	2019	" He can have no other objection save that which would apply equally to all suitors . I mean his fear lest Tom Bowles might do her some mischief , if he knew she was about to marry any one else . "
60488	60505	59758	59758	his	2019	" You think , then , that Mr. Bowles is a thoroughly bad and dangerous person ? "
60506	60521	59758	59758	his	2019	" Thoroughly bad and dangerous , and worse since he has taken to drinking . "
60522	60540	59758	59758	his	2019	" I suppose he did not take to drinking till he lost his wits for Jessie Wiles ? "
60541	60551	59758	59758	his	2019	" No , I do n't think he did . "
60552	60569	59758	59758	his	2019	" But , Mr. Lethbridge , have you never used your influence over this dangerous man ? "
60570	60630	59758	59758	his	2019	" Of course , I did try , but I only got insulted . He is a godless animal , and has not been inside a church for years . He seems to have got a smattering of such vile learning as may be found in infidel publications , and I doubt if he has any religion at all . "
60631	60642	59758	59758	his	2019	" Poor Polyphemus ! no wonder his Galatea shuns him . "
60643	60675	59758	59758	his	2019	" Old Wiles is terribly frightened , and asked my wife to find Jessie a place as servant at a distance . But Jessie ca n't bear the thoughts of leaving . "
60676	60690	59758	59758	his	2019	" For the same reason which attaches Will Somers to the native soil ? "
60691	60697	59758	59758	his	2019	" My wife thinks so . "
60698	60750	59758	59758	his	2019	" Do you believe that if Tom Bowles were out of the way , and Jessie and Will were man and wife , they could earn a sufficient livelihood as successors to Mrs. Bawtrey , Will adding the profits of his basket - work to those of the shop and land ? "
60751	60802	59758	59758	his	2019	" A sufficient livelihood ! of course . They would be quite rich . I know the shop used to turn a great deal of money . The old woman , to be sure , is no longer up to the business , but still she retains a good custom . "
60803	60835	59758	59758	his	2019	" Will Somers seems in delicate health . Perhaps if he had a less weary struggle for a livelihood , and no fear of losing Jessie , his health would improve . "
60836	60845	59758	59758	his	2019	" His life would be saved , sir . "
60846	60849	60851	60851	Kenelm	261	" Then , "
60867	61049	60851	60851	Kenelm	261	" though I myself entertain a profound compassion for that disturbance to our mental equilibrium which goes by the name of ' love , ' and I am the last person who ought to add to the cares and sorrows which marriage entails upon its victims , - I say nothing of the woes destined to those whom marriage usually adds to a population already overcrowded , - I fear that I must be the means of bringing these two love - birds into the same cage . I am ready to purchase the shop and its appurtenances on their behalf , on the condition that you will kindly obtain the consent of Jessie 's father to their union . As for my brave friend Tom Bowles , I undertake to deliver them and the village from that exuberant nature , which requires a larger field for its energies . Pardon me for not letting you interrupt me . I have not yet finished what I have to say . Allow me to ask if Mrs. Grundy resides in this village . "
61050	61076	59758	59758	his	2019	" Mrs. Grundy ! Oh , I understand . Of course ; wherever a woman has a tongue , there Mrs. Grundy has a home . "
61077	61166	60851	60851	Kenelm	261	" And seeing that Jessie is very pretty , and that in walking with her I encountered Mr. Bowles , might not Mrs. Grundy say , with a toss of her head , ' that it was not out of pure charity that the stranger had been so liberal to Jessie Wiles ' ? But if the money for the shop be paid through you to Mrs. Bawtrey , and you kindly undertake all the contingent arrangements , Mrs. Grundy will have nothing to say against any one . "
61179	61182	61183	61183	he	373	" Sir , "
61191	61227	61183	61183	he	373	" I scarcely know how to express my admiration of a generosity so noble , so thoughtful , and accompanied with a delicacy , and , indeed , with a wisdom , which - which - "
61228	61370	60851	60851	Kenelm	261	" Pray , my dear sir , do not make me still more ashamed of myself than I am at present for an interference in love matters quite alien to my own convictions as to the best mode of making an ' Approach to the Angels . ' To conclude this business , I think it better to deposit in your hands the sum of L45 , for which Mrs. Bawtrey has agreed to sell the remainder of her lease and stock - in - hand ; but , of course , you will not make anything public till I am gone , and Tom Bowles too . I hope I may get him away to - morrow ; but I shall know to - night when I can depend on his departure , and till he goes I must stay . "
61395	61425	61522	61522	he	908	" May I at least ask the name of the gentleman who honours me with his confidence , and has bestowed so much happiness on members of my flock ? "
61426	61493	61522	61522	he	908	" There is no great reason why I should not tell you my name , but I see no reason why I should . You remember Talleyrand 's advice , ' If you are in doubt whether to write a letter or not , do n't . ' The advice applies to many doubts in life besides that of letter - writing . Farewell , sir ! "
61494	61501	61503	61504	the parson	908	" A most extraordinary young man , "
61525	61530	61522	61522	he	908	" Quite an original . "
61587	61634	61575	61575	Kenelm	261	" My dear Mr. Saunderson , though you have no longer any work for me to do , and I ought not to trespass further on your hospitality , yet if I might stay with you another day or so , I should be very grateful . "
61635	61640	61642	61643	the farmer	1658	" My dear lad , "
61659	61726	61642	61643	the farmer	1658	" you are welcome to stay as long as you like , and we shall be all sorry when you go . Indeed , at all events , you must stay over Saturday , for you shall go with us to the squire 's harvest - supper . It will be a pretty sight , and my girls are already counting on you for a dance . "
61727	61771	61642	61643	the farmer	1658	" Saturday , - the day after to - morrow . You are very kind ; but merrymakings are not much in my way , and I think I shall be on my road before you set off to the Squire 's supper . "
61772	61806	61642	61643	the farmer	1658	" Pooh ! you shall stay ; and , I say , young ' un , if you want more to do , I have a job for you quite in your line . "
61807	61812	61642	61643	the farmer	1658	" What is it ? "
61813	61840	61642	61643	the farmer	1658	" Thrash my ploughman . He has been insolent this morning , and he is the biggest fellow in the county , next to Tom Bowles . "
61852	61858	61860	61860	Kenelm	261	" Thank you for nothing , "
61866	61874	61860	61860	Kenelm	261	" A burnt child dreads the fire . "
61974	61980	61982	61982	he	261	" Is it then true , "
61986	62043	61982	61982	he	261	" that I am born to pass through life utterly alone ; asking , indeed , for no sister - half of myself , disbelieving its possibility , shrinking from the thought of it , - half scorning , half pitying those who sigh for it ? - thing unattainable , - better sigh for the moon !
62044	62364	62366	62366	Kenelm	261	" Yet if other men sigh for it , why do I stand apart from them ? If the world be a stage , and all the men and women in it merely players , am I to be the solitary spectator , with no part in the drama and no interest in the vicissitudes of its plot ? Many there are , no doubt , who covet as little as I do the part of ' Lover , ' ' with a woful ballad , made to his mistress 's eyebrow ; ' but then they covet some other part in the drama , such as that of Soldier ' bearded as a pard , ' or that of Justice ' in fair round belly with fat capon lined . ' But me no ambition fires : I have no longing either to rise or to shine . I do n't desire to be a colonel , nor an admiral , nor a member of Parliament , nor an alderman ; I do not yearn for the fame of a wit , or a poet , or a philosopher , or a diner - out , or a crack shot at a rifle - match or a battue . Decidedly , I am the one looker - on , the one bystander , and have no more concern with the active world than a stone has . It is a horrible phantasmal crotchet of Goethe , that originally we were all monads , little segregated atoms adrift in the atmosphere , and carried hither and thither by forces over which we had no control , especially by the attraction of other monads , so that one monad , compelled by porcine monads , crystallizes into a pig ; another , hurried along by heroic monads , becomes a lion or an Alexander . Now it is quite clear , "
62380	62637	62366	62366	Kenelm	261	" that a monad intended or fitted for some other planet may , on its way to that destination , be encountered by a current of other monads blowing earthward , and be caught up in the stream and whirled on , till , to the marring of its whole proper purpose and scene of action , it settles here , - conglomerated into a baby . Probably that lot has befallen me : my monad , meant for another region in space , has been dropped into this , where it can never be at home , never amalgamate with other monads nor comprehend why they are in such a perpetual fidget . I declare I know no more why the minds of human beings should be so restlessly agitated about things which , as most of them own , give more pain than pleasure , than I understand why that swarm of gnats , which has such a very short time to live , does not give itself a moment 's repose , but goes up and down , rising and falling as if it were on a seesaw , and making as much noise about its insignificant alternations of ascent and descent as if it were the hum of men . And yet , perhaps , in another planet my monad would have frisked and jumped and danced and seesawed with congenial monads , as contentedly and as sillily as do the monads of men and gnats in this alien Vale of Tears . "
62704	62746	62839	62839	Kenelm	261	" There are times when the troubles of life are still ; The bees wandered lost in the depths of June , And I paused where the chime of a silver rill Sang the linnet and lark to their rest at noon .
62747	62790	62839	62839	Kenelm	261	" Said my soul , ' See how calmly the wavelets glide , Though so narrow their way to their ocean vent ; And the world that I traverse is wide , is wide , And yet is too narrow to hold content '
62791	62834	62839	62839	Kenelm	261	" O my son , never say that the world is wide ; The rill in its banks is less closely pent : It is thou who art shoreless on every side , And thy width will not let thee enclose content . "
62911	62914	62916	62916	Kenelm	261	" Sir , "
62921	62935	62916	62916	Kenelm	261	" well met once more . Have you ever listened to the cuckoo ? "
62936	62939	62941	62942	the minstrel	2047	" Sir , "
62944	62955	62941	62942	the minstrel	2047	" have you ever felt the presence of the summer ? "
62956	62996	62916	62916	Kenelm	261	" Permit me to shake hands with you . I admire the question by which you have countermet and rebuked my own . If you are not in a hurry , will you sit down and let us talk ? "
63064	63194	63029	63029	his	261	" I asked you , sir , if you had ever listened to the cuckoo from no irrelevant curiosity ; for often on summer days , when one is talking with one 's self , - and , of course , puzzling one 's self , - a voice breaks out , as it were from the heart of Nature , so far is it and yet so near ; and it says something very quieting , very musical , so that one is tempted inconsiderately and foolishly to exclaim , ' Nature replies to me . ' The cuckoo has served me that trick pretty often . Your song is a better answer to a man 's self - questionings than he can ever get from a cuckoo . "
63195	63200	63202	63203	the minstrel	2047	" I doubt that , "
63205	63262	63202	63203	the minstrel	2047	" Song , at the best , is but the echo of some voice from the heart of Nature . And if the cuckoo 's note seemed to you such a voice , it was an answer to your questionings perhaps more simply truthful than man can utter , if you had rightly construed the language . "
63263	63268	63270	63270	Kenelm	261	" My good friend , "
63272	63449	63270	63270	Kenelm	261	" what you say sounds very prettily ; and it contains a sentiment which has been amplified by certain critics into that measureless domain of dunderheads which is vulgarly called BOSH . But though Nature is never silent , though she abuses the privilege of her age in being tediously gossiping and garrulous , Nature never replies to our questions : she ca n't understand an argument ; she has never read Mr. Mill 's work on Logic . In fact , as it is truly said by a great philosopher , ' Nature has no mind . ' Every man who addresses her is compelled to force upon her for a moment the loan of his own mind . And if she answers a question which his own mind puts to her , it is only by such a reply as his own mind teaches to her parrot - like lips . And as every man has a different mind , so every man gets a different answer . Nature is a lying old humbug . "
63465	63485	63456	63456	his	2047	" Poets would have a great deal to unlearn if they are to look upon Nature in that light . "
63486	63502	63456	63456	his	2047	" Bad poets would , and so much the better for them and their readers . "
63503	63512	63456	63456	his	2047	" Are not good poets students of Nature ? "
63513	63852	63456	63456	his	2047	" Students of Nature , certainly , as surgeons study anatomy by dissecting a dead body . But the good poet , like the good surgeon , is the man who considers that study merely as the necessary A B C , and not as the all - in - all essential to skill in his practice . I do not give the fame of a good surgeon to a man who fills a book with details , more or less accurate , of fibres and nerves and muscles ; and I do n't give the fame of a good poet to a man who makes an inventory of the Rhine or the Vale of Gloucester . The good surgeon and the good poet are they who understand the living man . What is that poetry of drama which Aristotle justly ranks as the highest ? Is it not a poetry in which description of inanimate Nature must of necessity be very brief and general ; in which even the external form of man is so indifferent a consideration that it will vary with each actor who performs the part ? A Hamlet may be fair or dark . A Macbeth may be short or tall . The merit of dramatic poetry consists in the substituting for what is commonly called Nature namely , external and material Nature creatures intellectual , emotional , but so purely immaterial that they may be said to be all mind and soul , accepting the temporary loans of any such bodies at hand as actors may offer , in order to be made palpable and visible to the audience , but needing no such bodies to be palpable and visible to readers . The highest kind of poetry is therefore that which has least to do with external Nature . But every grade has its merit more or less genuinely great , according as it instils into Nature that which is not there , - the reason and the soul of man . "
63853	63860	63862	63863	the minstrel	2047	" I am not much disposed , "
63865	63954	63862	63863	the minstrel	2047	" to acknowledge any one form of poetry to be practically higher than another ; that is , so far as to elevate the poet who cultivates what you call the highest with some success above the rank of the poet who cultivates what you call a very inferior school with a success much more triumphant . In theory , dramatic poetry may be higher than lyric , and ' Venice Preserved ' is a very successful drama ; but I think Burns a greater poet than Otway . "
63955	64115	63456	63456	his	2047	" Possibly he may be ; but I know of no lyrical poet , at least among the moderns , who treats less of Nature as the mere outward form of things , or more passionately animates her framework with his own human heart , than does Robert Burns . Do you suppose when a Greek , in some perplexity of reason or conscience , addressed a question to the oracular oak - leaves of Dodona that the oak - leaves answered him ? Do n't you rather believe that the question suggested by his mind was answered by the mind of his fellow - man , the priest , who made the oak - leaves the mere vehicle of communication , as you and I might make such vehicle in a sheet of writing - paper ? Is not the history of superstition a chronicle of the follies of man in attempting to get answers from external Nature ? "
64116	64119	64121	64122	the minstrel	2047	" But , "
64124	64152	64121	64122	the minstrel	2047	" have I not somewhere heard or read that the experiments of Science are the answers made by Nature to the questions put to her by man ? "
64153	64306	64348	64348	Kenelm	261	" They are the answers which his own mind suggests to her , - nothing more . His mind studies the laws of matter , and in that study makes experiments on matter ; out of those experiments his mind , according to its previous knowledge or natural acuteness , arrives at its own deductions , and hence arise the sciences of mechanics and chemistry , etc . But the matter itself gives no answer : the answer varies according to the mind that puts the question ; and the progress of science consists in the perpetual correction of the errors and falsehoods which preceding minds conceived to be the correct answers they received from Nature . It is the supernatural within us , - namely , Mind , - which can alone guess at the mechanism of the natural , namely , Matter . A stone can not question a stone . "
64355	64378	64348	64348	Kenelm	261	" ' Rapiamus , amici , Occasionem de die , dumque virent genua , Et decet , obducta solvatur fronte senectus ! ' "
64379	64387	64389	64390	the minstrel	2047	" Is not that quotation from Horace ? "
64392	64417	64348	64348	Kenelm	261	" Yes ; and I made it insidiously , in order to see if you had not acquired what is called a classical education . "
64418	64503	64348	64348	Kenelm	261	" I might have received such education , if my tastes and my destinies had not withdrawn me in boyhood from studies of which I did not then comprehend the full value . But I did pick up a smattering of Latin at school ; and from time to time since I left school I have endeavoured to gain some little knowledge of the most popular Latin poets ; chiefly , I own to my shame , by the help of literal English translations . "
64504	64571	64348	64348	Kenelm	261	" As a poet yourself , I am not sure that it would be an advantage to know a dead language so well that its forms and modes of thought ran , though perhaps unconsciously , into those of the living one in which you compose . Horace might have been a still better poet if he had not known Greek better than you know Latin . "
64572	64584	64586	64587	the singer	1562	" It is at least courteous in you to say so , "
64594	64602	64604	64604	Kenelm	261	" You would be still more courteous , "
64606	64660	64604	64604	Kenelm	261	" if you would pardon an impertinent question , and tell me whether it is for a wager that you wander through the land , Homer - like , as a wandering minstrel , and allow that intelligent quadruped your companion to carry a tray in his mouth for the reception of pennies ? "
64661	64697	64348	64348	Kenelm	261	" No , it is not for a wager ; it is a whim of mine , which I fancy from the tone of your conversation you could understand , being apparently somewhat whimsical yourself . "
64698	64711	64604	64604	Kenelm	261	" So far as whim goes , be assured of my sympathy . "
64712	65067	64348	64348	Kenelm	261	" Well , then , though I follow a calling by the exercise of which I secure a modest income , my passion is verse . If the seasons were always summer , and life were always youth , I should like to pass through the world singing . But I have never ventured to publish any verses of mine . If they fell still - born it would give me more pain than such wounds to vanity ought to give to a bearded man ; and if they were assailed or ridiculed it might seriously injure me in my practical vocation . That last consideration , were I quite alone in the world , might not much weigh on me ; but there are others for whose sake I should like to make fortune and preserve station . Many years ago - it was in Germany - I fell in with a German student who was very poor , and who did make money by wandering about the country with lute and song . He has since become a poet of no mean popularity , and he has told me that he is sure he found the secret of that popularity in habitually consulting popular tastes during his roving apprenticeship to song . His example strongly impressed me . So I began this experiment ; and for several years my summers have been all partly spent in this way . I am only known , as I think I told you before , in the rounds I take as ' The Wandering Minstrel ; ' I receive the trifling moneys that are bestowed on me as proofs of a certain merit . I should not be paid by poor people if I did not please ; and the songs which please them best are generally those I love best myself . For the rest , my time is not thrown away , - not only as regards bodily health , but healthfulness of mind : all the current of one 's ideas becomes so freshened by months of playful exercise and varied adventure . "
65068	65077	65079	65079	Kenelm	261	" Yes , the adventure is varied enough , "
65101	65122	64348	64348	Kenelm	261	" But do n't you find those mischief - makers , the women , always mix themselves up with adventure ? "
65123	65130	65132	65133	the minstrel	2047	" Bless them ! of course , "
65140	65157	65132	65133	the minstrel	2047	" In life , as on the stage , the petticoat interest is always the strongest . "
65158	65167	65169	65169	Kenelm	261	" I do n't agree with you there , "
65173	65223	65169	65169	Kenelm	261	" And you seem to me to utter a claptrap beneath the rank of your understanding . However , this warm weather indisposes one to disputation ; and I own that a petticoat , provided it be red , is not without the interest of colour in a picture . "
65224	65230	65232	65233	the minstrel	2047	" Well , young gentleman , "
65237	65306	65232	65233	the minstrel	2047	" the day is wearing on , and I must wish you good - by ; probably , if you were to ramble about the country as I do , you would see too many pretty girls not to teach you the strength of petticoat interest , - not in pictures alone ; and should I meet you again I may find you writing love - verses yourself . "
65307	65335	65169	65169	Kenelm	261	" After a conjecture so unwarrantable , I part company with you less reluctantly than I otherwise might do . But I hope we shall meet again . "
65336	65400	65232	65233	the minstrel	2047	" Your wish flatters me much ; but , if we do , pray respect the confidence I have placed in you , and regard my wandering minstrelsy and my dog 's tray as sacred secrets . Should we not so meet , it is but a prudent reserve on my part if I do not give you my right name and address . "
65401	65429	65169	65169	Kenelm	261	" There you show the cautious common - sense which belongs rarely to lovers of verse and petticoat interest . What have you done with your guitar ? "
65430	65474	65232	65233	the minstrel	2047	" I do not pace the roads with that instrument : it is forwarded to me from town to town under a borrowed name , together with other raiment that this , should I have cause to drop my character of wandering minstrel . "
65859	65866	65883	65883	he	5565	" that trembled between two worlds , "
65902	65905	65883	65883	he	5565	" brother , "
65906	65915	65883	65883	he	5565	" The devil put it into my head . "
66097	66106	66090	66090	his	359	" What do you want with me now ? "
66107	66116	66090	66090	his	359	" I want to ask you a favour . "
66117	66120	66090	66090	his	359	" Favour ? "
66121	66141	66146	66146	himself	261	" The greatest which man can ask from man , - friendship . You see , my dear Tom , "
66176	66457	66152	66152	his	261	" you see , my dear Tom , that men like us - young , single , not on the whole bad - looking as men go - can find sweethearts in plenty . If one does not like us , another will ; sweethearts are sown everywhere like nettles and thistles . But the rarest thing in life is a friend . Now , tell me frankly , in the course of your wanderings did you ever come into a village where you could not have got a sweetheart if you had asked for one ; and if , having got a sweetheart , you had lost her , do you think you would have had any difficulty in finding another ? But have you such a thing in the world , beyond the pale of your own family , as a true friend , - a man friend ; and supposing that you had such a friend , - a friend who would stand by you through thick and thin ; who would tell you your faults to your face , and praise you for your good qualities behind your back ; who would do all he could to save you from a danger , and all he could to get you out of one , - supposing you had such a friend and lost him , do you believe that if you lived to the age of Methuselah you could find another ? You do n't answer me ; you are silent . Well , Tom , I ask you to be such a friend to me , and I will be such a friend to you . "
66462	66465	66458	66458	Tom	359	" taken aback "
66526	66543	66522	66522	his	359	" A pretty friend indeed , robbing me of my girl ! Go along with you ! "
66544	66561	66522	66522	his	359	" She was not your girl any more than she was or ever can be mine . "
66562	66571	66522	66522	his	359	" What , you be n't after her ? "
66572	66602	66522	66522	his	359	" Certainly not ; I am going to Luscombe , and I ask you to come with me . Do you think I am going to leave you here ? "
66603	66610	66522	66522	his	359	" What is it to you ? "
66611	66788	66522	66522	his	359	" Everything . Providence has permitted me to save you from the most lifelong of all sorrows . For - think ! Can any sorrow be more lasting than had been yours if you had attained your wish ; if you had forced or frightened a woman to be your partner till death do part , - you loving her , she loathing you ; you conscious , night and day , that your very love had insured her misery , and that misery haunting you like a ghost ! - that sorrow I have saved you . May Providence permit me to complete my work , and save you also from the most irredeemable of all crimes ! Look into your soul , then recall the thoughts which all day long , and not least at the moment I crossed this threshold , were rising up , making reason dumb and conscience blind , and then lay your hand on your heart and say , ' I am guiltless of a dream of murder . ' "
66839	66842	66844	66844	Kenelm	261	" Brother , "
66861	66879	66852	66852	his	261	" it is over now ; with that cry the demon that maddened you has fled forever . "
66903	67003	66899	66899	he	261	" All right ; Tom and I are sworn friends . We are going together to Luscombe the day after to - morrow , - Sunday ; just write a line to his uncle to prepare him for Tom 's visit , and send thither his clothes , as we shall walk , and steal forth unobserved betimes in the morning . Now go up and talk to him ; he wants a mother 's soothing and petting . He is a noble fellow at heart , and we shall be all proud of him some day or other . "
67019	67250	67013	67014	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" I have come from Mr. Saunderson 's , where I went in search of you . There is an unexpected hitch in the negotiation for Mrs. Bawtrey 's shop . After seeing you this morning I fell in with Mr. Travers 's bailiff , and he tells me that her lease does not give her the power to sublet without the Squire 's consent ; and that as the premises were originally let on very low terms to a favoured and responsible tenant , Mr. Travers can not be expected to sanction the transfer of the lease to a poor basket - marker : in fact , though he will accept Mrs. Bawtrey 's resignation , it must be in favour of an applicant whom he desires to oblige . On hearing this , I rode over to the Park and saw Mr. Travers himself . But he was obdurate to my pleadings . All I could get him to say was , ' Let the stranger who interests himself in the matter come and talk to me . I should like to see the man who thrashed that brute Tom Bowles : if he got the better of him perhaps he may get the better of me . Bring him with you to my harvest - supper to - morrow evening . ' Now , will you come ? "
67251	67254	67256	67256	Kenelm	261	" Nay , "
67260	67294	67256	67256	Kenelm	261	" but if he only asks me in order to gratify a very vulgar curiosity , I do n't think I have much chance of serving Will Somers . What do you say ? "
67295	67427	67013	67014	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" The Squire is a good man of business , and , though no one can call him unjust or grasping , still he is very little touched by sentiment ; and we must own that a sickly cripple like poor Will is not a very eligible tenant . If , therefore , it depended only on your chance with the Squire , I should not be very sanguine . But we have an ally in his daughter . She is very fond of Jessie Wiles , and she has shown great kindness to Will . In fact , a sweeter , more benevolent , sympathizing nature than that of Cecilia Travers does not exist . She has great influence with her father , and through her you may win him . "
67428	67439	67441	67441	Kenelm	261	" I particularly dislike having anything to do with women , "
67445	67471	67441	67441	Kenelm	261	" Parsons are accustomed to get round them . Surely , my dear sir , you are more fit for that work than I am . "
67472	67539	67013	67014	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" Permit me humbly to doubt that proposition ; one does n't get very quickly round the women when one carries the weight of years on one 's back . But whenever you want the aid of a parson to bring your own wooing to a happy conclusion , I shall be happy , in my special capacity of parson , to perform the ceremony required . "
67540	67544	67546	67546	Kenelm	261	" Dii meliora ! "
67550	67619	67546	67546	Kenelm	261	" Some ills are too serious to be approached even in joke . As for Miss Travers , the moment you call her benevolent you inspire me with horror . I know too well what a benevolent girl is , - officious , restless , fidgety , with a snub nose , and her pocket full of tracts . I will not go to the harvest - supper . "
67620	67623	67625	67626	the Parson	908	" Hist ! "
67665	67675	67649	67650	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" Hist ! and come here , - gently . "
67760	67783	67757	67757	her	358	" Do n't talk so , Will , you break my heart ; it is I who am not worthy of you . "
67784	67787	67789	67789	Kenelm	261	" Parson , "
67796	67841	67789	67789	Kenelm	261	" I must go to that confounded harvest - supper . I begin to think there is something true in the venerable platitude about love in a cottage . And Will Somers must be married in haste , in order to repent at leisure . "
67842	67861	67757	67757	her	358	" I do n't see why a man should repent having married a good girl whom he loves . "
67862	67882	67789	67789	Kenelm	261	" You do n't ? Answer me candidly . Did you ever meet a man who repented having married ? "
67883	67892	67757	67757	her	358	" Of course I have ; very often . "
67893	67916	67789	67789	Kenelm	261	" Well , think again , and answer as candidly . Did you ever meet a man who repented not having married ? "
67925	67928	67930	67930	Kenelm	261	" Sir , "
67932	67944	67930	67930	Kenelm	261	" your reticence proves your honesty , and I respect it . "
67960	67965	67954	67955	the Parson	908	" But - but - "
68019	68022	68024	68025	Mr. Saunderson	354	" Ha ! "
68033	68043	68024	68025	Mr. Saunderson	354	" you see it now , do n't you ? "
68044	68101	67979	67980	the former	1628	" I ? not a bit of it . You tell me that your grandfather was a farmer , and your father was a farmer , and that you have been a farmer for thirty years ; and from these premises you deduce the illogical and irrational conclusion that therefore your son must be a farmer . "
68102	68131	68024	68025	Mr. Saunderson	354	" Young man , you may think yourself very knowing 'cause you have been at the ' Varsity , and swept away a headful of book - learning . "
68132	68135	67979	67980	the former	1628	" Stop , "
68139	68148	67979	67980	the former	1628	" You grant that a university is learned . "
68149	68156	68024	68025	Mr. Saunderson	354	" Well , I suppose so . "
68157	68377	67979	67980	the former	1628	" But how could it be learned if those who quitted it brought the learning away ? We leave it all behind us in the care of the tutors . But I know what you were going to say , - that it is not because I had read more books than you have that I was to give myself airs and pretend to have more knowledge of life than a man of your years and experience . Agreed , as a general rule . But does not every doctor , however wise and skilful , prefer taking another doctor 's opinion about himself , even though that other doctor has just started in practice ? And seeing that doctors , taking them as a body , are monstrous clever fellows , is not the example they set us worth following ? Does it not prove that no man , however wise , is a good judge of his own case ? Now , your son 's case is really your case : you see it through the medium of your likings and dislikings ; and insist upon forcing a square peg into a round hole , because in a round hole you , being a round peg , feel tight and comfortable . Now I call that irrational . "
68378	68396	68398	68399	the farmer	1658	" I do n't see why my son has any right to fancy himself a square peg , "
68403	68460	68462	68463	the farmer	1658	" when his father and his grandfather and his great - grandfather have been round pegs ; and it is agin ' nature for any creature not to take after its own kind . A dog is a pointer or a sheep - dog according as its forebears were pointers or sheep - dogs . There , "
68475	68486	68462	68463	the farmer	1658	" I think I have posed you , young master ! "
68487	68536	68537	68538	Mr. Saunderson	354	" No ; for you have taken it for granted that the breeds have not been crossed . But suppose that a sheep - dog has married a pointer , are you sure that his son will not be more of a pointer than a sheep - dog ? "
68554	68558	68560	68560	Kenelm	261	" You see , "
68562	68660	68560	68560	Kenelm	261	" that you have crossed the breed . You married a tradesman 's daughter , and I dare say her grandfather and great - grandfather were tradesmen too . Now , most sons take after their mothers , and therefore Mr. Saunderson junior takes after his kind on the distaff side , and comes into the world a square peg , which can only be tight and comfortable in a square hole . It is no use arguing , Farmer : your boy must go to his uncle ; and there 's an end of the matter . "
68661	68665	68667	68668	the farmer	1658	" By goles ! "
68670	68684	68667	68668	the farmer	1658	" you seem to think you can talk me out of my senses . "
68685	68706	68560	68560	Kenelm	261	" No ; but I think if you had your own way you would talk your son into the workhouse . "
68707	68737	68667	68668	the farmer	1658	" What ! by sticking to the land like his father before him ? Let a man stick by the land , and the land will stick by him . "
68738	68890	68560	68560	Kenelm	261	" Let a man stick in the mud , and the mud will stick to him . You put your heart in your farm , and your son would only put his foot into it . Courage ! Do n't you see that Time is a whirligig , and all things come round ? Every day somebody leaves the land and goes off into trade . By and by he grows rich , and then his great desire is to get back to the land again . He left it the son of a farmer : he returns to it as a squire . Your son , when he gets to be fifty , will invest his savings in acres , and have tenants of his own . Lord , how he will lay down the law to them ! I would not advise you to take a farm under him . "
68891	68897	68899	68900	the farmer	1658	" Catch me at it ! "
68902	68926	68899	68900	the farmer	1658	" He would turn all the contents of the ' pothecary 's shop into my fallows , and call it ' progress . ' "
68927	68968	68560	68560	Kenelm	261	" Let him physic the fallows when he has farms of his own : keep yours out of his chemical clutches . Come , I shall tell him to pack up and be off to his uncle 's next week ? "
68969	68974	68976	68977	the farmer	1658	" Well , well , "
68984	68994	68976	68977	the farmer	1658	" a wilful man must e'en have his way . "
68995	69053	68560	68560	Kenelm	261	" And the best thing a sensible man can do is not to cross it . Mr. Saunderson , give me your honest hand . You are one of those men who put the sons of good fathers in mind of their own ; and I think of mine when I say ' God bless you ! ' "
69126	69147	69110	69111	The lad	1534	" Ah ! I see you have talked with the old governor , and he 'll not hear of it . "
69148	69154	69156	69156	Kenelm	261	" In the first place , "
69505	69505	69503	69503	you	2107	"
69580	69657	69567	69567	he	261	" Do n't take it to heart that I called you a conceited fool and an ass . These terms are no doubt just as applicable to myself . But there is a more conceited fool and a greater ass than either of us ; and that is the Age in which we have the misfortune to be born , - an Age of Progress , Mr. Saunderson , junior ! - an Age of Prigs . "
70386	70389	70383	70384	a bishop	2171	" a swell "
70395	70399	70383	70384	a bishop	2171	" awfully jolly . "
71387	71391	71382	71382	their	2216	" poor fellow ; "
71517	71548	71514	71514	he	393	" Let us settle in the country and try our best to live on a few hundreds , lay by , and keep the old place out of the market , "
72108	72189	72097	72097	he	399	" When a man once gives himself up to the care and improvement of a landed estate , he has no time and no heart for anything else . An estate is an income or a kingdom , according as the owner chooses to take it . I take it as a kingdom , and I can not be roi faineant , with a steward for maire du palais . A king does not go into the House of Commons . "
72658	72661	72650	72651	Mr. Travers	393	" No , "
72679	72714	72650	72651	Mr. Travers	393	" there would be no such things as strict justice and disciplined order in the world if a man yielded to a woman 's pleadings in any matter of business between man and man . "
72819	72830	72813	72813	you	2278	" Not at all the sort of man I expected . "
73468	73540	73461	73462	Mr. Travers	393	" I see old farmer Steen 's yellow gig . Mind how you talk to him , George . He is full of whims and crotchets , and if you once brush his feathers the wrong way he will be as vindictive as a parrot . But he is the man who must second you at the nomination . No other tenant - farmer carries the same weight with his class . "
73541	73545	73547	73547	George	404	" I suppose , "
73549	73571	73547	73547	George	404	" that if Mr. Steen is the best man to second me at the hustings , he is a good speaker ? "
73572	73682	73461	73462	Mr. Travers	393	" A good speaker ? in one sense he is . He never says a word too much . The last time he seconded the nomination of the man you are to succeed , this was his speech : ' Brother Electors , for twenty years I have been one of the judges at our county cattle - show . I know one animal from another . Looking at the specimens before us to - day none of them are as good of their kind as I 've seen elsewhere . But if you choose Sir John Hogg you 'll not get the wrong sow by the ear ! ' "
73683	73687	73689	73689	George	404	" At least , "
73701	73738	73689	73689	George	404	" Mr. Steen does not err on the side of flattery in his commendations of a candidate . But what makes him such an authority with the farmers ? Is he a first - rate agriculturist ? "
73739	73979	73461	73462	Mr. Travers	393	" In thrift , yes ! - in spirit , no ! He says that all expensive experiments should be left to gentlemen farmers . He is an authority with other tenants : firstly , because he is a very keen censor of their landlords ; secondly , because he holds himself thoroughly independent of his own ; thirdly , because he is supposed to have studied the political bearings of questions that affect the landed interest , and has more than once been summoned to give his opinion on such subjects to Committees of both Houses of Parliament . Here he comes . Observe , when I leave you to talk to him : firstly , that you confess utter ignorance of practical farming ; nothing enrages him like the presumption of a gentleman farmer like myself : secondly , that you ask his opinion on the publication of Agricultural Statistics , just modestly intimating that you , as at present advised , think that inquisitorial researches into a man 's business involve principles opposed to the British Constitution . And on all that he may say as to the shortcomings of landlords in general , and of your father in particular , make no reply , but listen with an air of melancholy conviction . How do you do , Mr. Steen , and how 's the mistress ? Why have you not brought her with you ? "
73980	73997	74110	74111	Mr. Travers	393	" My good woman is in the straw again , Squire . Who is that youngster ? "
73998	74007	73461	73462	Mr. Travers	393	" Hist ! let me introduce Mr. Belvoir . "
74014	74019	74021	74021	Steen	405	" No , sir ! "
74031	74094	74021	74021	Steen	405	" No offence , young gentleman . But I do n't give my hand at first sight to a man who wants to shake a vote out of it . Not that I know anything against you . But , if you be a farmer 's friend rabbits are not , and my lord your father is a great one for rabbits . "
74095	74102	74104	74104	George	404	" Indeed you are mistaken there ! "
74123	74128	74110	74111	Mr. Travers	393	" Hold your tongue . "
74270	74275	74277	74278	Mr. Travers	393	" Well , Lethbridge , "
74280	74291	74277	74278	Mr. Travers	393	" where is the young gladiator you promised to bring ? "
74292	74338	74240	74240	he	393	" I did bring him , and he was by my side not a minute ago . He has suddenly given me the slip : ' abiit , evasit , erupit . ' I was looking round for him in vain when you accosted me . "
74339	74356	74277	74278	Mr. Travers	393	" I hope he has not seen some guest of mine whom he wants to fight . "
74357	74362	74364	74365	the Parson	908	" I hope not , "
74369	74411	74364	74365	the Parson	908	" He 's a strange fellow . But I think you will be pleased with him ; that is , if he can be found . Oh , Mr. Saunderson , how do you do ? Have you seen your visitor ? "
74412	74438	74277	74278	Mr. Travers	393	" No , sir , I have just come . My mistress , Squire , and my three girls ; and this is my son . "
74439	74446	74448	74450	the graceful Squire	2331	" A hearty welcome to all , "
74457	74479	74448	74450	the graceful Squire	2331	" I suppose you are fond of dancing . Get yourself a partner . We may as well open the ball . "
74480	74491	74493	74494	Saunderson junior	354	" Thank you , sir , but I never dance , "
74514	74543	74544	74545	Mr. Belvoir	407	" Then you 'll have less to regret when you are grown old . But the band is striking up ; we must adjourn to the marquee . George "
74558	74579	74555	74555	his	407	" will you give your arm to Cecilia , to whom I think you are engaged for the first quadrille ? "
74580	74584	74586	74586	George	404	" I hope , "
74597	74716	74586	74586	George	404	" that Mr. Steen is not an average specimen of the electors I shall have to canvass . Whether he has been brought up to honour his own father and mother I ca n't pretend to say , but he seems bent upon teaching me not to honour mine . Having taken away my father 's moral character upon the unfounded allegation that he loved rabbits better than mankind , he then assailed my innocent mother on the score of religion , and inquired when she was going over to the Church of Rome , basing that inquiry on the assertion that she had taken away her custom from a Protestant grocer and conferred it on a Papist . "
74717	74848	74555	74555	his	407	" Those are favourable signs , Mr. Belvoir . Mr. Steen always prefaces a kindness by a great deal of incivility . I asked him once to lend me a pony , my own being suddenly taken lame , and he seized that opportunity to tell me that my father was an impostor in pretending to be a judge of cattle ; that he was a tyrant , screwing his tenants in order to indulge extravagant habits of hospitality ; and implied that it would be a great mercy if we did not live to apply to him , not for a pony , but for parochial relief . I went away indignant . But he sent me the pony . I am sure he will give you his vote . "
74849	74852	74854	74854	George	404	" Meanwhile , "
74870	74901	74854	74854	George	404	" I take encouragement from the belief that I have the good wishes of Miss Travers . If ladies had votes , as Mr. Mill recommends , why , then - "
74902	74914	74916	74917	Miss Travers	364	" Why , then , I should vote as Papa does , "
74921	74955	74916	74917	Miss Travers	364	" And if women had votes , I suspect there would be very little peace in any household where they did not vote as the man at the head of it wished them . "
74956	74964	74966	74969	the aspirant to Parliament	2336	" But I believe , after all , "
74973	75002	74966	74969	the aspirant to Parliament	2336	" that the advocates for female suffrage would limit it to women independent of masculine control , widows and spinsters voting in right of their own independent tenements . "
75003	75008	75010	75010	Cecilia	364	" In that case , "
75012	75041	75010	75010	Cecilia	364	" I suppose they would still generally go by the opinion of some man they relied on , or make a very silly choice if they did not . "
75042	75052	74916	74917	Miss Travers	364	" You underrate the good sense of your sex . "
75053	75105	75010	75010	Cecilia	364	" I hope not . Do you underrate the good sense of yours , if , in far more than half the things appertaining to daily life , the wisest men say , ' Better leave them to the women ' ? But you 're forgetting the figure , cavalier seul . "
75106	75111	75113	75113	George	404	" By the way , "
75122	75142	75113	75113	George	404	" do you know a Mr. Chillingly , the son of Sir Peter , of Exmundham , in Westshire ? "
75143	75151	75010	75010	Cecilia	364	" No ; why do you ask ? "
75152	75190	75113	75113	George	404	" Because I thought I caught a glimpse of his face : it was just as Mr. Steen was bearing me away down that plantation . From what you say , I must suppose I was mistaken . "
75191	75241	75010	75010	Cecilia	364	" Chillingly ! But surely some persons were talking yesterday at dinner about a young gentleman of that name as being likely to stand for Westshire at the next election , but who had made a very unpopular and eccentric speech on the occasion of his coming of age . "
75242	75393	75113	75113	George	404	" The same man : I was at college with him , - a very singular character . He was thought clever ; won a prize or two ; took a good degree : but it was generally said that he would have deserved a much higher one if some of his papers had not contained covert jests either on the subject or the examiners . It is a dangerous thing to set up as a humourist in practical life , - especially public life . They say Mr. Pitt had naturally a great deal of wit and humour , but he wisely suppressed any evidence of those qualities in his Parliamentary speeches . Just like Chillingly , to turn into ridicule the important event of festivities in honour of his coming of age , - an occasion that can never occur again in the whole course of his life . "
75394	75400	75402	75402	Cecilia	364	" It was bad taste , "
75404	75419	75402	75402	Cecilia	364	" if intentional . But perhaps he was misunderstood , or taken by surprise . "
75420	75637	75113	75113	George	404	" Misunderstood , - possibly ; but taken by surprise , - no . The coolest fellow I ever met . Not that I have met him very often . Latterly , indeed , at Cambridge he lived much alone . It was said that he read hard . I doubt that ; for my rooms were just over his , and I know that he was much more frequently out of doors than in . He rambled a good deal about the country on foot . I have seen him in by - lanes a dozen miles distant from the town when I have been riding back from the bunt . He was fond of the water , and pulled a mighty strong oar , but declined to belong to our University crew ; yet if ever there was a fight between undergraduates and bargemen , he was sure to be in the midst of it . Yes , a very great oddity indeed , full of contradictions , for a milder , quieter fellow in general intercourse you could not see ; and as for the jests of which he was accused in his examination papers , his very face should have acquitted him of the charge before any impartial jury of his countrymen . "
75638	75648	75650	75650	Cecilia	364	" You sketch quite an interesting picture of him , "
75652	75666	75650	75650	Cecilia	364	" I wish we did know him : he would be worth seeing . "
75667	75719	75113	75113	George	404	" And , once seen , you would not easily forget him , - a dark , handsome face , with large melancholy eyes , and with one of those spare slender figures which enable a man to disguise his strength , as a fraudulent billiard - player disguises his play . "
75745	75760	75762	75762	George	404	" How well your father plays the part of host to these rural folks ! "
75769	75825	75762	75762	George	404	" Do observe how quietly he puts that shy young farmer at his ease , and now how kindly he deposits that lame old lady on the bench , and places the stool under her feet . What a canvasser he would be ! and how young he still looks , and how monstrous handsome ! "
75986	76046	75977	75977	Travers	399	" I have been talking much to the Saundersons about that young man who did us the inestimable service of punishing your ferocious parishioner , Tom Bowles ; and all I hear so confirms the interest your own account inspired me with that I should really like much to make his acquaintance . Has not he turned up yet ? "
76047	76080	76236	76237	Mr. Lethbridge	373	" No ; I fear he must have gone . But in that case I hope you will take his generous desire to serve my poor basket - maker into benevolent consideration . "
76081	76231	75977	75977	Travers	399	" Do not press me ; I feel so reluctant to refuse any request of yours . But I have my own theory as to the management of an estate , and my system does not allow of favour . I should wish to explain that to the young stranger himself ; for I hold courage in such honour that I do not like a brave man to leave these parts with an impression that Leopold Travers is an ungracious churl . However , he may not have gone . I will go and look for him myself . Just tell Cecilia that she has danced enough with the gentry , and that I have told Farmer Turby 's son , a fine young fellow and a capital rider across country , that I expect him to show my daughter that he can dance as well as he rides . "
76436	76444	76446	76447	Leopold Travers	399	" I think I am not mistaken , "
76449	76477	76446	76447	Leopold Travers	399	" in assuming you to be the gentleman whom Mr. Lethbridge promised to introduce to me , and who is staying with my tenant , Mr. Saunderson ? "
76513	76516	76518	76518	he	399	" Nay , "
76520	76526	76518	76518	he	399	" let us talk seated ; "
76542	76548	76550	76550	Travers	399	" In the first place , "
76552	76686	76550	76550	Travers	399	" I must thank you for having done a public service in putting down the brute force which has long tyrannized over the neighbourhood . Often in my young days I have felt the disadvantage of height and sinews , whenever it would have been a great convenience to terminate dispute or chastise insolence by a resort to man 's primitive weapons ; but I never more lamented my physical inferiority than on certain occasions when I would have given my ears to be able to thrash Tom Bowles myself . It has been as great a disgrace to my estate that that bully should so long have infested it as it is to the King of Italy not to be able with all his armies to put down a brigand in Calabria . "
76687	76723	76534	76534	he	399	" Pardon me , Mr. Travers , but I am one of those rare persons who do not like to hear ill of their friends . Mr. Thomas Bowles is a particular friend of mine . "
76724	76727	76729	76729	Travers	393	" Eh ! "
76733	76741	76729	76729	Travers	393	" ' Friend ! ' you are joking .
76742	76790	76534	76534	he	399	" You would not accuse me of joking if you knew me better . But surely you have felt that there are few friends one likes more cordially , and ought to respect more heedfully , than the enemy with whom one has just made it up . "
76791	76802	76804	76804	Travers	393	" You say well , and I accept the rebuke , "
76811	76908	76804	76804	Travers	393	" And I certainly have less right to abuse Mr. Bowles than you have , since I had not the courage to fight him . To turn to another subject less provocative . Mr. Lethbridge has told me of your amiable desire to serve two of his young parishioners , Will Somers and Jessie Wiles , and of your generous offer to pay the money Mrs. Bawtrey demands for the transfer of her lease . To that negotiation my consent is necessary , and that consent I can not give . Shall I tell you why ? "
76909	76920	76534	76534	he	399	" Pray do . Your reasons may admit of argument . "
76921	76928	76930	76931	Mr. Travers	393	" Every reason admits of argument , "
76957	77626	76930	76931	Mr. Travers	393	" I do not , however , tell you my reasons for the sake of argument , but in vindication of my seeming want of courtesy towards yourself . I have had a very hard and a very difficult task to perform in bringing the rental of my estate up to its proper value . In doing so , I have been compelled to adopt one uniform system , equally applied to my largest and my pettiest holdings . That system consists in securing the best and safest tenants I can , at the rents computed by a valuer in whom I have confidence . To this system , universally adopted on my estate , though it incurred much unpopularity at first , I have at length succeeded in reconciling the public opinion of my neighbourhood . People began by saying I was hard ; they now acknowledge I am just . If I once give way to favour or sentiment , I unhinge my whole system . Every day I am subjected to moving solicitations . Lord Twostars , a keen politician , begs me to give a vacant farm to a tenant because he is an excellent canvasser , and has always voted straight with the party . Mrs. Fourstars , a most benevolent woman , entreats me not to dismiss another tenant , because he is in distressed circumstances and has a large family ; very good reasons perhaps for my excusing him an arrear , or allowing him a retiring pension , but the worst reasons in the world for letting him continue to ruin himself and my land . Now , Mrs. Bawtrey has a small holding on lease at the inadequate rent of L8 a year . She asks L45 for its transfer , but she ca n't transfer the lease without my consent ; and I can get L12 a year as a moderate rental from a large choice of competent tenants . It will better answer me to pay her the L45 myself , which I have no doubt the incoming tenant would pay me back , at least in part ; and if he did not , the additional rent would be good interest for my expenditure . Now , you happen to take a sentimental interest , as you pass through the village , in the loves of a needy cripple whose utmost industry has but served to save himself from parish relief , and a giddy girl without a sixpence , and you ask me to accept these very equivocal tenants instead of substantial ones , and at a rent one - third less than the market value . Suppose that I yielded to your request , what becomes of my reputation for practical , business - like justice ? I shall have made an inroad into the system by which my whole estate is managed , and have invited all manner of solicitations on the part of friends and neighbours , which I could no longer consistently refuse , having shown how easily I can be persuaded into compliance by a stranger whom I may never see again . And are you sure , after all , that , if you did prevail on me , you would do the individual good you aim at ? It is , no doubt , very pleasant to think one has made a young couple happy . But if that young couple fail in keeping the little shop to which you would transplant them and nothing more likely : peasants seldom become good shopkeepers , and find themselves , with a family of children , dependent solely , not on the arm of a strong labourer , but the ten fingers of a sickly cripple , who makes clever baskets , for which there is but slight and precarious demand in the neighbourhood , may you not have insured the misery of the couple you wished to render happy ? "
77627	77633	77635	77635	Kenelm	261	" I withdraw all argument , "
77661	78027	77650	77652	a Greenland bear	2364	" I am more and more convinced that of all the shams in the world that of benevolence is the greatest . It seems so easy to do good , and it is so difficult to do it . Everywhere , in this hateful civilized life , one runs one 's head against a system . A system , Mr. Travers , is man 's servile imitation of the blind tyranny of what in our ignorance we call ' Natural Laws , ' a mechanical something through which the world is ruled by the cruelty of General Principles , to the utter disregard of individual welfare . By Natural Laws creatures prey on each other , and big fishes eat little ones upon system . It is , nevertheless , a hard thing for the little fish . Every nation , every town , every hamlet , every occupation , has a system , by which , somehow or other , the pond swarms with fishes , of which a great many inferiors contribute to increase the size of a superior . It is an idle benevolence to keep one solitary gudgeon out of the jaws of a pike . Here am I doing what I thought the simplest thing in the world , asking a gentleman , evidently as good - natured as myself , to allow an old woman to let her premises to a deserving young couple , and paying what she asks for it out of my own money . And I find that I am running against a system , and invading all the laws by which a rental is increased and an estate improved . Mr. Travers , you have no cause for regret in not having beaten Tom Bowles . You have beaten his victor , and I now give up all dream of further interference with the Natural Laws that govern the village which I have visited in vain . I had meant to remove Tom Bowles from that quiet community . I shall now leave him to return to his former habits , - to marry Jessie Wiles , which he certainly will do , and - "
78028	78031	78033	78034	Mr. Travers	393	" Hold ! "
78036	78053	78033	78034	Mr. Travers	393	" Do you mean to say that you can induce Tom Bowles to leave the village ? "
78054	78095	77650	77652	a Greenland bear	2364	" I had induced him to do it , provided Jessie Wiles married the basket - maker ; but , as that is out of the question , I am bound to tell him so , and he will stay . "
78096	78154	78033	78034	Mr. Travers	393	" But if he left , what would become of his business ? His mother could not keep it on ; his little place is a freehold ; the only house in the village that does not belong to me , or I should have ejected him long ago . Would he sell the premises to me ? "
78155	78223	77650	77652	a Greenland bear	2364	" Not if he stays and marries Jessie Wiles . But if he goes with me to Luscombe and settles in that town as a partner to his uncle , I suppose he would be too glad to sell a house of which he can have no pleasant recollections . But what then ? You can not violate your system for the sake of a miserable forge . "
78224	78268	78033	78034	Mr. Travers	393	" It would not violate my system if , instead of yielding to a sentiment , I gained an advantage ; and , to say truth , I should be very glad to buy that forge and the fields that go with it . "
78269	78317	77650	77652	a Greenland bear	2364	" ' Tis your affair now , not mine , Mr. Travers . I no longer presume to interfere . I leave the neighbourhood to - morrow : see if you can negotiate with Mr. Bowles . I have the honour to wish you a good evening . "
78318	78354	78033	78034	Mr. Travers	393	" Nay , young gentleman , I can not allow you to quit me thus . You have declined apparently to join the dancers , but you will at least join the supper . Come ! "
78355	78375	77650	77652	a Greenland bear	2364	" Thank you sincerely , no . I came here merely on the business which your system has settled . "
78376	78387	78033	78034	Mr. Travers	393	" But I am not sure that it is settled . "
78408	78498	78392	78392	his	393	" I know that I am speaking to a gentleman at least equal in rank to myself , but as I enjoy the melancholy privilege of being the older man , do not think I take an unwarrantable liberty in asking if you object to tell me your name . I should like to introduce you to my daughter , who is very partial to Jessie Wiles and to Will Somers . But I ca n't venture to inflame her imagination by designating you as a prince in disguise . "
78499	78712	78392	78392	his	393	" Mr. Travers , you express yourself with exquisite delicacy . But I am just starting in life , and I shrink from mortifying my father by associating my name with a signal failure . Suppose I were an anonymous contributor , say , to ' The Londoner , ' and I had just brought that highly intellectual journal into discredit by a feeble attempt at a good - natured criticism or a generous sentiment , would that be the fitting occasion to throw off the mask , and parade myself to a mocking world as the imbecile violator of an established system ? Should I not , in a moment so untoward , more than ever desire to merge my insignificant unit in the mysterious importance which the smallest Singular obtains when he makes himself a Plural , and speaks not as ' I , ' but as ' We ' ? We are insensible to the charm of young ladies ; We are not bribed by suppers ; We , like the witches of ' Macbeth , ' have no name on earth ; We are the greatest wisdom of the greatest number ; We are so upon system ; We salute you , Mr. Travers , and depart unassailable . "
78772	78783	78761	78762	George Belvoir	404	" Chillingly ! I thought I could not be mistaken . "
78784	78787	78789	78790	Leopold Travers	399	" Chillingly ! "
78794	78806	78789	78790	Leopold Travers	399	" Are you the son of my old friend Sir Peter ? "
78840	78875	78826	78827	Leopold Travers	399	" If my father was your friend , do not disgrace his son . Do not say I am a failure . Deviate from your system , and let Will Somers succeed Mrs. Bawtrey . "
78888	78896	78884	78884	he	261	" Yes ; we have met before . "
78897	78900	78902	78902	Travers	399	" Cecilia , "
78907	78990	78902	78902	Travers	399	" I am happy to introduce to you as Mr. Chillingly , not only the son of an old friend of mine , not only the knight - errant of whose gallant conduct on behalf of your protegee Jessie Wiles we have heard so much , but the eloquent arguer who has conquered my better judgment in a matter on which I thought myself infallible . Tell Mr. Lethbridge that I accept Will Somers as a tenant for Mrs. Bawtrey 's premises . "
78999	79023	78991	78991	Kenelm	261	" May it be in my power to do a kind thing to you , in spite of any system to the contrary ! "
79024	79045	78991	78991	Kenelm	261	" Mr. Chillingly , give your arm to my daughter . You will not now object to join the dancers ? "
79125	79160	79288	79288	He	2372	" You have chosen a delightful mode of seeing the country this lovely summer weather , Mr. Chillingly . I believe such pedestrian exercises are very common with university students during the long vacation . "
79161	79217	79288	79288	He	2372	" Very common , though they generally wander in packs like wild dogs or Australian dingoes . It is only a tame dog that one finds on the road travelling by himself ; and then , unless he behaves very quietly , it is ten to one that he is stoned as a mad dog . "
79218	79238	79288	79288	He	2372	" But I am afraid , from what I hear , that you have not been travelling very quietly . "
79239	79287	79288	79288	He	2372	" You are quite right , Miss Travers , and I am a sad dog if not a mad one . But pardon me : we are nearing the marquee ; the band is striking up , and , alas ! I am not a dancing dog . "
79297	79307	79309	79309	she	364	" Let us sit here a while , then , "
79318	79345	79309	79309	she	364	" I have no engagement for the next dance , and , as I am a little tired , I shall be glad of a reprieve . "
79374	79383	79364	79364	his	261	" You were at college with Mr. Belvoir ? "
79384	79388	79288	79288	He	2372	" I was . "
79389	79396	79364	79364	his	261	" He was thought clever there ? "
79397	79406	79288	79288	He	2372	" I have not a doubt of it . "
79407	79441	79364	79364	his	261	" You know he is canvassing our county for the next election . My father takes a warm interest in his success , and thinks he will be a useful member of Parliament . "
79442	79608	79288	79288	He	2372	" Of that I am certain . For the first five years he will be called pushing , noisy , and conceited , much sneered at by men of his own age , and coughed down on great occasions ; for the five following years he will be considered a sensible man in committees , and a necessary feature in debate ; at the end of those years he will be an under - secretary ; in five years more he will be a Cabinet Minister , and the representative of an important section of opinions ; he will be an irreproachable private character , and his wife will be seen wearing the family diamonds at all the great parties . She will take an interest in politics and theology ; and if she die before him , her husband will show his sense of wedded happiness by choosing another lady , equally fitted to wear the family diamonds and to maintain the family consequences . "
79657	79668	79669	79669	she	364	" Are you a fortune - teller , Mr. Chillingly ? "
79679	79695	80017	80017	Kenelm	261	" As good a one as any whose hand you could cross with a shilling . "
79696	79704	80017	80017	Kenelm	261	" Will you tell me my fortune ? "
79705	79781	80017	80017	Kenelm	261	" No ; I never tell the fortunes of ladies , because your sex is credulous , and a lady might believe what I tell her . And when we believe such and such is to be our fate , we are too apt to work out our life into the verification of the belief . If Lady Macbeth had disbelieved in the witches , she would never have persuaded her lord to murder Duncan . "
79782	79803	80017	80017	Kenelm	261	" But can you not predict me a more cheerful fortune than that tragical illustration of yours seems to threaten ? "
79804	79852	80017	80017	Kenelm	261	" The future is never cheerful to those who look on the dark side of the question . Mr. Gray is too good a poet for people to read nowadays , otherwise I should refer you to his lines in the ' Ode to Eton College , ' -
79853	79874	80017	80017	Kenelm	261	" ' See how all around us wait The ministers of human fate , And black Misfortune 's baleful train . '
79875	79933	80017	80017	Kenelm	261	" Meanwhile it is something to enjoy the present . We are young ; we are listening to music ; there is no cloud over the summer stars ; our conscience is clear ; our hearts untroubled : why look forward in search of happiness ? shall we ever be happier than we are at this moment ? "
79940	79951	79953	79953	he	393	" We are going to supper in a few minutes , "
79955	80016	79953	79953	he	393	" and before we lose sight of each other , Mr. Chillingly , I wish to impress on you the moral fact that one good turn deserves another . I have yielded to your wish , and now you must yield to mine . Come and stay a few days with me , and see your benevolent intentions carried out . "
80094	80109	80085	80085	Kenelm	261	" I accept your invitation . Would the middle of next week suit you ? "
80110	80122	80085	80085	Kenelm	261	" The sooner the better . Why not to - morrow ? "
80123	80165	80085	80085	Kenelm	261	" To - morrow I am pre - engaged to an excursion with Mr. Bowles . That may occupy two or three days , and meanwhile I must write home for other garments than those in which I am a sham . "
80166	80173	80085	80085	Kenelm	261	" Come any day you like . "
80174	80177	80085	80085	Kenelm	261	" Agreed . "
80178	80190	80085	80085	Kenelm	261	" Agreed ; and , hark ! the supper - bell . "
80191	80194	80196	80196	Kenelm	261	" Supper , "
80336	80343	80327	80327	him	2390	" So saying , his face brightened .
80617	80622	80612	80612	Leopold	399	" his old friend , "
80641	80643	80640	80650	the " dears " and " darlings " of conjugal intercourse	2398	" dears "
80645	80647	80640	80650	the " dears " and " darlings " of conjugal intercourse	2398	" darlings "
80689	80696	80682	80683	Kenelm Chillingly	261	" Neesdale Park , near Beaverston . "
80862	80867	80814	80814	his	359	" a hopeless attachment . "
82207	82210	82212	82212	he	359	" Tom , "
82220	82228	82212	82212	he	359	" what do you say to breakfast ? "
82233	82244	82230	82230	Tom	359	" I am not hungry ; but as you like . "
82245	82316	82230	82230	Tom	359	" Thank you , then we will stop here a while . I find it difficult to believe that you are not hungry , for you are very strong , and there are two things which generally accompany great physical strength : the one is a keen appetite ; the other is - though you may not suppose it , and it is not commonly known - a melancholic temperament . "
82317	82324	82230	82230	Tom	359	" Eh ! - a what ? "
82325	82350	82230	82230	Tom	359	" A tendency to melancholy . Of course you have heard of Hercules : you know the saying ' as strong as Hercules ' ? "
82351	82357	82230	82230	Tom	359	" Yes , of course . "
82358	82529	82230	82230	Tom	359	" Well , I was first led to the connection between strength , appetite , and melancholy , by reading in an old author named Plutarch that Hercules was among the most notable instances of melancholy temperament which the author was enabled to quote . That must have been the traditional notion of the Herculean constitution ; and as for appetite , the appetite of Hercules was a standard joke of the comic writers . When I read that observation it set me thinking , being myself melancholic and having an exceedingly good appetite . Sure enough , when I began to collect evidence , I found that the strongest men with whom I made acquaintance , including prize - fighters and Irish draymen , were disposed to look upon life more on the shady than the sunny side of the way ; in short , they were melancholic . But the kindness of Providence allowed them to enjoy their meals , as you and I are about to do . "
82686	82689	82691	82691	Kenelm	261	" No , "
82693	82795	82691	82691	Kenelm	261	" No , Tom ; you have promised me friendship , and that is not compatible with brandy . Brandy is the worst enemy a man like you can have ; and would make you quarrel even with me . If you want a stimulus I allow you a pipe . I do n't smoke myself , as a rule , but there have been times in my life when I required soothing , and then I have felt that a whiff of tobacco stills and softens one like the kiss of a little child . Bring this gentleman a pipe . "
82898	82911	82895	82895	Kenelm	261	" We have yet far to go : we must push on . "
83100	83111	83113	83113	Kenelm	261	" Now let us sit here a while and listen , "
83124	83149	83116	83116	himself	261	" I see that you brought away your pipe from the inn , and provided yourself with tobacco : refill the pipe and listen . "
83156	83160	83162	83162	Kenelm	261	" O friend , "
83174	83201	83162	83162	Kenelm	261	" do you not feel what a blessed thing it is in this mortal life to be ever and anon reminded that you have a soul ? "
83217	83220	83202	83202	Tom	359	" Eh ! "
83225	83460	83221	83221	Kenelm	261	" You and I , Tom , are not so good as we ought to be : of that there is no doubt ; and good people would say justly that we should now be within yon church itself rather than listening to its bell . Granted , my friend , granted ; but still it is something to hear that bell , and to feel by the train of thought which began in our innocent childhood , when we said our prayers at the knees of a mother , that we were lifted beyond this visible Nature , beyond these fields and woods and waters , in which , fair though they be , you and I miss something ; in which neither you nor I are as happy as the kine in the fields , as the birds on the bough , as the fishes in the water : lifted to a consciousness of a sense vouchsafed to you and to me , not vouchsafed to the kine , to the bird , and the fish , - a sense to comprehend that Nature has a God , and Man has a life hereafter . The bell says that to you and to me . Were that bell a thousand times more musical it could not say that to beast , bird , and fish . Do you understand me , Tom ? "
83472	83490	83461	83461	Tom	359	" I never thought of it before ; but , as you put it , I understand . "
83491	83707	83221	83221	Kenelm	261	" Nature never gives to a living thing capacities not practically meant for its benefit and use . If Nature gives to us capacities to believe that we have a Creator whom we never saw , of whom we have no direct proof , who is kind and good and tender beyond all that we know of kind and good and tender on earth , it is because the endowment of capacities to conceive such a Being must be for our benefit and use : it would not be for our benefit and use if it were a lie . Again , if Nature has given to us a capacity to receive the notion that we live again , no matter whether some of us refuse so to believe , and argue against it , - why , the very capacity to receive the idea for unless we receive it we could not argue against it proves that it is for our benefit and use ; and if there were no such life hereafter , we should be governed and influenced , arrange our modes of life , and mature our civilization , by obedience to a lie , which Nature falsified herself in giving us the capacity to believe . You still understand me ? "
83708	83733	83461	83461	Tom	359	" Yes ; it bothers me a little , for you see I am not a parson 's man ; but I do understand . "
83734	83928	83221	83221	Kenelm	261	" Then , my friend , study to apply , - for it requires constant study , - study to apply that which you understand to your own case . You are something more than Tom Bowles , the smith and doctor of horses ; something more than the magnificent animal who rages for his mate and fights every rival : the bull does that . You are a soul endowed with the capacity to receive the idea of a Creator so divinely wise and great and good that , though acting by the agency of general laws , He can accommodate them to all individual cases , so that - taking into account the life hereafter , which He grants to you the capacity to believe - all that troubles you now will be proved to you wise and great and good either in this life or the other . Lay that truth to your heart , friend , now - before the bell stops ringing ; recall it every time you hear the church - bell ring again . And oh , Tom , you have such a noble nature ! - "
83929	83943	83461	83461	Tom	359	" I - I ! do n't jeer me , - do n't . "
83944	84070	83221	83221	Kenelm	261	" Such a noble nature ; for you can love so passionately , you can war so fiercely , and yet , when convinced that your love would be misery to her you love , can resign it ; and yet , when beaten in your war , can so forgive your victor that you are walking in this solitude with him as a friend , knowing that you have but to drop a foot behind him in order to take his life in an unguarded moment ; and rather than take his life , you would defend it against an army . Do you think I am so dull as not to see all that ? and is not all that a noble nature ? "
84086	84228	83221	83221	Kenelm	261	" Well , then , to that noble nature I now trust . I myself have done little good in life . I may never do much ; but let me think that I have not crossed your life in vain for you and for those whom your life can colour for good or for bad . As you are strong , be gentle ; as you can love one , be kind to all ; as you have so much that is grand as Man , - that is , the highest of God 's works on earth , - let all your acts attach your manhood to the idea of Him , to whom the voice of the bell appeals . Ah ! the bell is hushed ; but not your heart , Tom , - that speaks still . "
84480	84484	84477	84477	he	261	" Poor fellow ! "
84572	84596	84570	84570	himself	261	" I can not , I do not stand in this world ; like a ghost I glide beside it , and look on "
84845	84867	84869	84869	Tom	359	" There is a short cut across the fields beyond that stile , which leads straight to my uncle 's house , "
84871	84901	84869	84869	Tom	359	" and I dare say , sir , that you will be glad to escape the dirty suburb by which the road passes before we get into the town . "
84902	85007	84869	84869	Tom	359	" A good thought , Tom . It is very odd that fine towns always are approached by dirty suburbs ; a covert symbolical satire , perhaps , on the ways to success in fine towns . Avarice or ambition go through very mean little streets before they gain the place which they jostle the crowd to win , - in the Townhall or on ' Change . Happy the man who , like you , Tom , finds that there is a shorter and a cleaner and a pleasanter way to goal or to resting - place than that through the dirty suburbs ! "
85164	85170	85172	85172	Kenelm	261	" By the sacred Nine , "
85174	85189	85172	85172	Kenelm	261	" thou art the dog with the tin tray ! where is thy master ? "
85237	85242	85243	85243	he	261	" Come this way , "
85248	85259	85243	85243	he	261	" I recognize an acquaintance . You will like him . "
85278	85288	85290	85290	Kenelm	261	" YOU see we are fated to meet again , "
85310	85335	85304	85304	Tom	359	" But you seem to add the accomplishment of drawing to that of verse - making ! You sketch from what you call Nature ? "
85336	85347	85293	85293	himself	261	" From what I call Nature ! yes , sometimes . "
85348	85442	85444	85444	he	2532	" And do you not find in drawing , as in verse - making , the truth that I have before sought to din into your reluctant ears ; namely , that Nature has no voice except that which man breathes into her out of his mind ? I would lay a wager that the sketch you are now taking is rather an attempt to make her embody some thought of your own , than to present her outlines as they appear to any other observer . Permit me to judge for myself . "
85551	85556	85557	85557	he	261	" I was right , "
85561	85632	85557	85557	he	261	" From this height there is a beautiful view , as it presents itself to me ; a beautiful view of the town , its meadows , its river , harmonized by the sunset ; for sunset , like gilding , unites conflicting colours , and softens them in uniting . But I see nothing of that view in your sketch . What I do see is to me mysterious . "
85633	85639	85641	85642	the minstrel	2047	" The view you suggest , "
85644	85675	85641	85642	the minstrel	2047	" is no doubt very fine , but it is for a Turner or a Claude to treat it . My grasp is not wide enough for such a landscape . "
85676	85690	85641	85642	the minstrel	2047	" I see indeed in your sketch but one figure , a child . "
85691	85708	85641	85642	the minstrel	2047	" Hist ! there she stands . Hist ! while I put in this last touch . "
85833	85839	85841	85841	Kenelm	261	" But at that distance , "
85871	85914	85860	85860	his	261	" but at that distance , how can you distinguish the girl 's face ? How can you discover that the dim object she has just thrown up and recaught is a ball made of flowers ? Do you know the child ? "
85915	86155	86211	86212	the minstrel	2047	" I never saw her before this evening ; but as I was seated here she was straying around me alone , weaving into chains some wild - flowers which she had gathered by the hedgerows yonder , next the high road ; and as she strung them she was chanting to herself some pretty nursery rhymes . You can well understand that when I heard her thus chanting I became interested , and as she came near me I spoke to her , and we soon made friends . She told me she was an orphan , and brought up by a very old man distantly related to her , who had been in some small trade and now lived in a crowded lane in the heart of the town . He was very kind to her , and being confined himself to the house by age or ailment he sent her out to play in the fields on summer Sundays . She had no companions of her own age . She said she did not like the other little girls in the lane ; and the only little girl she liked at school had a grander station in life , and was not allowed to play with her , and so she came out to play alone ; and as long as the sun shines and the flowers bloom , she says she never wants other society . "
86156	86191	85860	85860	his	261	" Tom , do you hear that ? As you will be residing in Luscombe , find out this strange little girl , and be kind to her , Tom , for my sake . "
86237	86341	86233	86234	The minstrel	2047	" While the child was talking to me I mechanically took the flower - chains from her hands , and not thinking what I was about , gathered them up into a ball . Suddenly she saw what I had done , and instead of scolding me for spoiling her pretty chains , which I richly deserved , was delighted to find I had twisted them into a new plaything . She ran off with the ball , tossing it about till , excited with her own joy , she got to the brow of the hill , and I began my sketch . "
86342	86353	86233	86234	The minstrel	2047	" Is that charming face you have drawn like hers ? "
86354	86421	86233	86234	The minstrel	2047	" No ; only in part . I was thinking of another face while I sketched , but it is not like that either ; in fact , it is one of those patchworks which we call ' fancy heads , ' and I meant it to be another version of a thought that I had just put into rhyme when the child came across me . "
86422	86429	86233	86234	The minstrel	2047	" May we hear the rhyme ? "
86430	86446	86233	86234	The minstrel	2047	" I fear that if it did not bore yourself it would bore your friend . "
86447	86459	86233	86234	The minstrel	2047	" I am sure not . Tom , do you sing ? "
86460	86467	86469	86469	Tom	359	" Well , I have sung , "
86476	86486	86469	86469	Tom	359	" and I should like to hear this gentleman . "
86487	86518	86520	86521	the minstrel	2047	" But I do not know these verses , just made , well enough to sing them ; it is enough if I can recall them well enough to recite . "
86586	86627	86731	86731	he	6007	" By the muddy crossing in the crowded streets Stands a little maid with her basket full of posies , Proffering all who pass her choice of knitted sweets , Tempting Age with heart's - ease , courting Youth with roses .
86628	86652	86731	86731	he	6007	" Age disdains the heart's - ease , Love rejects the roses ; London life is busy , - Who can stop for posies ?
86653	86696	86731	86731	he	6007	" One man is too grave , another is too gay ; This man has his hothouse , that man not a penny : Flowerets too are common in the month of May , And the things most common least attract the many .
86697	86722	86731	86731	he	6007	" Ill , on London crossings , Fares the sale of posies ; Age disdains the heart's - ease , Youth rejects the roses . "
86771	86788	86731	86731	he	6007	" I see with great grief that I am better at sketching than rhyming . Can you "
86792	86802	86731	86731	he	6007	" even comprehend what I mean by the verses ? "
86806	86813	86803	86803	KENELM	261	" Do you comprehend , Tom ? "
86820	86823	86814	86814	TOM	359	" No . "
86827	86911	86824	86824	KENELM	261	" I presume that by his flower - girl our friend means to represent not only poetry , but a poetry like his own , which is not at all the sort of poetry now in fashion . I , however , expand his meaning , and by his flower - girl I understand any image of natural truth or beauty for which , when we are living the artificial life of crowded streets , we are too busy to give a penny . "
86912	86919	86921	86922	the minstrel	2047	" Take it as you please , "
86932	86959	86921	86922	the minstrel	2047	" but I have not expressed in words that which I did mean half so well as I have expressed it in my sketch - book . "
86960	86966	86968	86968	Kenelm	261	" Ah ! and how ? "
86970	87054	86921	86922	the minstrel	2047	" The image of my thought in the sketch , be it poetry or whatever you prefer to call it , does not stand forlorn in the crowded streets : the child stands on the brow of the green hill , with the city stretched in confused fragments below , and , thoughtless of pennies and passers - by , she is playing with the flowers she has gathered ; but in play casting them heavenward , and following them with heavenward eyes . "
87055	87058	87060	87060	Kenelm	261	" Good ! "
87062	87065	87060	87060	Kenelm	261	" good ! "
87083	87120	87074	87074	he	261	" Pardon me that remark of mine the other day about a beefsteak . But own that I am right : what you call a sketch from Nature is but a sketch of your own thought . "
87268	87301	87262	87262	Kenelm	261	" I suppose you are going to some inn ; may I accompany you ? We can sup together , and I should like to hear you talk upon poetry and Nature . "
87302	87350	87262	87262	Kenelm	261	" You flatter me much ; but I have friends in the town , with whom I lodge , and they are expecting me . Do you not observe that I have changed my dress ? I am not known here as the ' Wandering Minstrel . ' "
87419	87423	87425	87425	Kenelm	261	" I fear , "
87429	87502	87425	87425	Kenelm	261	" that your change of dress betokens the neighbourhood of those pretty girls of whom you spoke in an earlier meeting . According to the Darwinian doctrine of selection , fine plumage goes far in deciding the preference of Jenny Wren and her sex , only we are told that fine - feathered birds are very seldom songsters as well . It is rather unfair to rivals when you unite both attractions . "
87507	87588	87503	87504	The minstrel	2047	" There is but one girl in my friend 's house , - his niece ; she is very plain , and only thirteen . But to me the society of women , whether ugly or pretty , is an absolute necessity ; and I have been trudging without it for so many days that I can scarcely tell you how my thoughts seemed to shake off the dust of travel when I found myself again in the presence of - "
87589	87593	87595	87595	Kenelm	261	" Petticoat interest , "
87597	87700	87595	87595	Kenelm	261	" Take care of yourself . My poor friend with whom you found me is a grave warning against petticoat interest , from which I hope to profit . He is passing through a great sorrow ; it might have been worse than sorrow . My friend is going to stay in this town . If you are staying here too , pray let him see something of you . It will do him a wondrous good if you can beguile him from this real life into the gardens of poetland ; but do not sing or talk of love to him . "
87701	87707	87709	87710	the minstrel	2047	" I honour all lovers , "
87719	87762	87709	87710	the minstrel	2047	" and would willingly serve to cheer or comfort your friend , if I could ; but I am bound elsewhere , and must leave Luscombe , which I visit on business - money business - the day after to - morrow . "
87763	87784	87716	87716	his	2047	" So , too , must I. At least give us both some hours of your time to - morrow . "
87785	87869	87709	87710	the minstrel	2047	" Certainly ; from twelve to sunset I shall be roving about , - a mere idler . If you will both come with me , it will be a great pleasure to myself . Agreed ! Well , then , I will call at your inn to - morrow at twelve ; and I recommend for your inn the one facing us , - The Golden Lamb . I have heard it recommended for the attributes of civil people and good fare . "
87912	87918	87920	87920	Kenelm	261	" But one word more , "
87922	88027	87920	87920	Kenelm	261	" Your host or hostess , if resident here , can , no doubt , from your description of the little girl and the old man her protector , learn the child 's address . If so , I should like my companion to make friends with her . Petticoat interest there at least will be innocent and safe . And I know nothing so likely to keep a big , passionate heart like Tom 's , now aching with a horrible void , occupied and softened , and turned to directions pure and gentle , as an affectionate interest in a little child . "
88037	88051	88033	88033	he	2047	" Sir , are you a wizard that you say that to me ? "
88052	88098	88028	88029	The minstrel	2047	" I am not a wizard , but I guess from your question that you have a little child of your own . So much the better : the child may keep you out of much mischief . Remember the little child . Good evening . "
88517	88525	88530	88530	he	261	" The new civilization versus the old , "
88585	88593	88638	88639	The girl	1594	" Are you kind to - night ? "
88599	88602	88604	88604	Kenelm	261	" Kind ! "
88613	88637	88604	88604	Kenelm	261	" kind ! Alas , my poor sister mortal ! if pity be kindness , who can see you and not be kind ? "
89277	89280	89281	89281	he	2660	" Holloa , "
89303	89314	89281	89281	he	2660	" is it not time for you to come in ? "
89315	89324	89326	89328	the handsome lady	2663	" Do n't be so tiresome , Fritz , "
89349	89372	89326	89328	the handsome lady	2663	" Your friend has been sulking the whole evening , and is only just beginning to be pleasant as the moon rises . "
89373	89391	89393	89395	the bald man	2666	" The moon has a good effect on poets and other mad folks , I dare say , "
89404	89429	89393	89395	the bald man	2666	" But I ca n't have my little niece laid up again just as she is on the mend : Annie , come in . "
89441	89450	89452	89454	the bald man	2666	" Ah , Mother , you are wise , "
89456	89470	89471	89471	He	2666	" and a game at euchre is safer than poetizing in night air . "
89495	89520	89485	89485	she	2340	" As for you two sentimentalists and moon - gazers , I give you ten minutes ' time , - not more , mind . "
89521	89524	89526	89527	the minstrel	2047	" Tyrant ! "
89627	89632	89634	89634	Kenelm	261	" They are foreigners , "
89636	89754	89634	89634	Kenelm	261	" though the man does speak English so well . That accounts for playing euchre of a Sunday evening , as if there were no harm in it . Euchre is an American game . The man is called Fritz . Ah ! I guess - Germans who have lived a good deal in America ; and the verse - maker said he was at Luscombe on pecuniary business . Doubtless his host is a merchant , and the verse - maker in some commercial firm . That accounts for his concealment of name , and fear of its being known that he was addicted in his holiday to tastes and habits so opposed to his calling . "
89998	90017	89973	89974	the lady	802	" Tell me those verses again . I must remember every word of them when you are gone . "
90031	90034	90036	90037	the lady	802	" Do , "
90066	90066	90057	90057	I	0	"
90067	90070	90072	90073	the minstrel	2047	" What ? "
90075	90080	90084	90084	his	2047	" Love 's quarrel . "
90133	90177	90120	90120	his	2047	" Standing by the river , gazing on the river , See it paved with starbeams , - heaven is at our feet ; Now the wave is troubled , now the rushes quiver ; Vanished is the starlight : it was a deceit .
90178	90221	90120	90120	his	2047	" Comes a little cloudlet ' twixt ourselves and heaven , And from all the river fades the silver track ; Put thine arms around me , whisper low , ' Forgiven ! ' See how on the river starlight settles back . "
90241	90244	90233	90234	the lady	802	" Forgiven , "
90290	90300	90269	90270	The minstrel	2047	" Mischief ! mischief ! Remember the little child ! "
90301	90304	90305	90305	he	2047	" Hush ! "
90311	90319	90305	90305	he	2047	" Did you not hear a voice ? "
90320	90324	90326	90327	the lady	802	" Only yours , "
90329	90349	90305	90305	he	2047	" It was our guardian angel 's , Amalie . It came in time . We will go within . "
90585	90623	90582	90582	KENELM	261	" I have asked my friend Tom Bowles to come a little later , because I wished you to be of use to him , and , in order to be so , I should suggest how . "
90628	90632	90624	90625	THE MINSTREL	2047	" Pray do . "
90636	90662	90633	90633	KENELM	261	" You know that I am not a poet , and I do not have much reverence for verse - making merely as a craft . "
90667	90671	90663	90664	THE MINSTREL	438	" Neither have I. "
90675	90744	90672	90672	KENELM	261	" But I have a great reverence for poetry as a priesthood . I felt that reverence for you when you sketched and talked priesthood last evening , and placed in my heart - I hope forever while it beats - the image of the child on the sunlit hill , high above the abodes of men , tossing her flower - ball heavenward and with heavenward eyes . "
90771	90835	90768	90768	Kenelm	261	" I have been educated in the Realistic school , and with realism I am discontented , because in realism as a school there is no truth . It contains but a bit of truth , and that the coldest and hardest bit of it , and he who utters a bit of truth and suppresses the rest of it tells a lie . "
90841	90897	90836	90837	THE MINSTREL	2047	" Does the critic who says to me , ' Sing of beefsteak , because the appetite for food is a real want of daily life , and do n't sing of art and glory and love , because in daily life a man may do without such ideas , ' - tell a lie ? "
90901	90943	90898	90898	KENELM	261	" Thank you for that rebuke . I submit to it . No doubt I did tell a lie , - that is , if I were quite in earnest in my recommendation , and if not in earnest , why - "
90948	90953	90944	90945	THE MINSTREL	2047	" You belied yourself . "
90957	91035	90954	90954	KENELM	261	" Very likely . I set out on my travels to escape from shams , and begin to discover that I am a sham par excellence . But I suddenly come across you , as a boy dulled by his syntax and his vulgar fractions suddenly comes across a pleasant poem or a picture - book , and feels his wits brighten up . I owe you much : you have done me a world of good . "
91036	91043	90944	90945	THE MINSTREL	2047	" I can not guess how . "
91044	91166	90954	90954	KENELM	261	" Possibly not , but you have shown me how the realism of Nature herself takes colour and life and soul when seen on the ideal or poetic side of it . It is not exactly the words that you say or sing that do me the good , but they awaken within me new trains of thought , which I seek to follow out . The best teacher is the one who suggests rather than dogmatizes , and inspires his listener with the wish to teach himself . Therefore , O singer ! whatever be the worth in critical eyes of your songs , I am glad to remember that you would like to go through the world always singing . "
91167	91192	90944	90945	THE MINSTREL	2047	" Pardon me : you forget that I added , ' if life were always young , and the seasons were always summer . ' "
91193	91365	90954	90954	KENELM	261	" I do not forget . But if youth and summer fade for you , you leave youth and summer behind you as you pass along , - behind in hearts which mere realism would make always old , and counting their slothful beats under the gray of a sky without sun or stars ; wherefore I pray you to consider how magnificent a mission the singer 's is , - to harmonize your life with your song , and toss your flowers , as your child does , heavenward , with heavenward eyes . Think only of this when you talk with my sorrowing friend , and you will do him good , as you have done me , without being able to guess how a seeker after the Beautiful , such as you , carries us along with him on his way ; so that we , too , look out for beauty , and see it in the wild - flowers to which we had been blind before . "
91664	91691	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" You tell me that you are no poet , yet I am sure you have a poet 's perception : you must have written poetry ? "
91692	91839	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" Not I ; as I before told you , only school verses in dead languages : but I found in my knapsack this morning a copy of some rhymes , made by a fellow - collegian , which I put into my pocket meaning to read them to you both . They are not verses like yours , which evidently burst from you spontaneously , and are not imitated from any other poets . These verses were written by a Scotchman , and smack of imitation from the old ballad style . There is little to admire in the words themselves , but there is something in the idea which struck me as original , and impressed me sufficiently to keep a copy , and somehow or other it got into the leaves of one of the two books I carried with me from home . "
91840	91857	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" What are those books ? Books of poetry both , I will venture to wager - "
91858	91901	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" Wrong ! Both metaphysical , and dry as a bone . Tom , light your pipe , and you , sir , lean more at ease on your elbow ; I should warn you that the ballad is long . Patience ! "
91902	91905	91907	91908	the minstrel	2047	" Attention ! "
91910	91913	91915	91915	Tom	359	" Fire ! "
91935	91954	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" WHY gathers the crowd in the market - place Ere the stars have yet left the sky ? "
91955	91975	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" For a holiday show and an act of grace , - At the sunrise a witch shall die . "
91976	92013	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" What deed has she done to deserve that doom ? Has she blighted the standing corn , Or rifled for philters a dead man 's tomb , Or rid mothers of babes new - born ? "
92014	92052	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" Her pact with the fiend was not thus revealed , She taught sinners the Word to hear ; The hungry she fed , and the sick she healed , And was held as a Saint last year .
92053	92091	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" But a holy man , who at Rome had been , Had discovered , by book and bell , That the marvels she wrought were through arts unclean , And the lies of the Prince of Hell .
92092	92131	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" And our Mother the Church , for the dame was rich , And her husband was Lord of Clyde , Would fain have been mild to this saint - like witch If her sins she had not denied .
92132	92175	91658	91659	the wanderer	2545	" But hush , and come nearer to see the sight , Sheriff , halberds , and torchmen , - look ! That 's the witch standing mute in her garb of white , By the priest with his bell and book . "
92356	92375	92326	92326	her	2749	" Lord Ronald ! men marry for love or gold , Mickle rich must have been thy bride ! "
92376	92397	92326	92326	her	2749	" Man 's heart may be bought , woman 's hand be sold , On the banks of our northern Clyde .
92398	92440	92326	92326	her	2749	" My bride is , in sooth , mickle rich to me Though she brought not a groat in dower , For her face , couldst thou see it as I do see , Is the fairest in hall or bower ! "
92452	92479	92442	92443	the bishop	2754	" Satan reigns on the Clyde alway , And the taint in the blood of the witch doth cling To the child that she brought to day .
92480	92517	92326	92326	her	2749	" Lord Ronald hath come from the Paynim land With a bride that appals the sight ; Like his dam she hath moles on her dread right hand , And she turns to a snake at night .
92518	92556	92442	92443	the bishop	2754	" It is plain that a Scot who can blindly dote On the face of an Eastern ghoul , And a ghoul who was worth not a silver groat , Is a Scot who has lost his soul .
92557	92595	92326	92326	her	2749	" It were wise to have done with this demon tree Which has teemed with such caukered fruit ; Add the soil where it stands to my holy See , And consign to the flames its root . "
92596	92600	92442	92443	the bishop	2754	" Holy man ! "
92609	92641	92606	92606	he	442	" we know That thy tongue never wags in vain , But the Church cist is full , and the king 's is low , And the Clyde is a fair domain .
92642	92679	92606	92606	he	442	" Yet a knight that 's bewitched by a laidly fere Needs not much to dissolve the spell ; We will summon the bride and the bridegroom here Be at hand with thy book and bell . "
92758	92794	92751	92751	he	2754	" Lord Ronald , the knights of thy race and mine Should have mates in their own degree ; What parentage , say , hath that bride of thine Who hath come from the far countree ?
92795	92833	92849	92849	her	2766	" And what was her dowry in gold or land , Or what was the charm , I pray , That a comely young gallant should woo the hand Of the ladye we see to - day ? "
92854	92873	92849	92849	her	2766	" Saucy king , did I utter my father 's name , Thou wouldst kneel as his liegeman down .
92874	92912	92849	92849	her	2766	" Though I brought to Lord Ronald nor lands nor gold , Nor the bloom of a fading cheek ; Yet , were I a widow , both young and old Would my hand and my dowry seek .
92913	92951	92849	92849	her	2766	" For the wish that he covets the most below , And would hide from the saints above , Which he dares not to pray for in weal or woe , Is the dowry I bring my love .
92952	92988	92849	92849	her	2766	" Let every man look in his heart and see What the wish he most lusts to win , And then let him fasten his eyes on me While he thinks of his darling sin . "
93091	93100	93056	93061	the coo of the woodland dove	2772	" In thy widow shall be my wife . "
93202	93211	93199	93199	he	379	" Lo ! my ladye hath kept her word .
93212	93252	93199	93199	he	379	" Now I leave her to others to woo and win , For no longer I find her fair ; Could I look on the face of my darling sin , I should see but a dead man 's there .
93253	93293	93199	93199	he	379	" And the dowry she brought me is here returned , For the wish of my heart has died , It is quenched in the blood of the priest who burned My sweet mother , the Saint of Clyde . "
93491	93499	93501	93501	Kenelm	261	" What say you to the ballad ? "
93506	93513	93515	93515	he	261	" It is not without power , "
93517	93525	93526	93527	The minstrel	2047	" Ay , of a certain kind . "
93546	93603	93526	93527	The minstrel	2047	" The Scotch are a thoughtful race . The Scot who wrote this thing may have thought of a day when he saw beauty in the face of a darling sin ; but , if so , it is evident that his sight recovered from that glamoury . Shall we walk on ? Come , Tom . "
93617	93657	93604	93605	The minstrel	2047	" I regret that I can not see more of either of you , as I quit Luscombe at daybreak . Here , by the by , I forgot to give it before , is the address you wanted . "
93661	93674	93675	93676	The minstrel	2047	" Of the little child . I am glad you remembered her . "
93733	93747	93749	93749	he	359	" Did you not mean those rhymes to hit me here - here ? "
93754	93798	93727	93727	Tom	359	" The rhymes were written long before I saw you , Tom ; but it is well if their meaning strike us all . Of you , my friend , I have no fear now . Are you not already a changed man ? "
93799	93811	93813	93813	Tom	359	" I feel as if I were going through a change , "
93821	93860	93813	93813	Tom	359	" In hearing you and that gentleman talk so much of things that I never thought of , I felt something in me , - you will laugh when I tell you , - something like a bird . "
93861	93875	93727	93727	Tom	359	" Like a bird , - good ! - a bird has wings . "
93876	93880	93813	93813	Tom	359	" Just so . "
93881	94126	93727	93727	Tom	359	" And you felt wings that you were unconscious of before , fluttering and beating themselves as against the wires of a cage . You were true to your instincts then , my dear fellow - man , - instincts of space and Heaven . Courage ! - the cage - door will open soon . And now , practically speaking , I give you this advice in parting : You have a quick and sensitive mind which you have allowed that strong body of yours to incarcerate and suppress . Give that mind fair play . Attend to the business of your calling diligently ; the craving for regular work is the healthful appetite of mind : but in your spare hours cultivate the new ideas which your talk with men who have been accustomed to cultivate the mind more than the body has sown within you . Belong to a book - club , and interest yourself in books . A wise man has said , ' Books widen the present by adding to it the past and the future . ' Seek the company of educated men and educated women too ; and when you are angry with another , reason with him : do n't knock him down ; and do n't be knocked down yourself by an enemy much stronger than yourself , - Drink . Do all this , and when I see you again you will be - "
94127	94139	93813	93813	Tom	359	" Stop , sir , - you will see me again ? "
94140	94152	93727	93727	Tom	359	" Yes , if we both live , I promise it . "
94153	94156	93813	93813	Tom	359	" When ? "
94157	94243	93727	93727	Tom	359	" You see , Tom , we have both of us something in our old selves which we must work off . You will work off your something by repose , and I must work off mine , if I can , by moving about . So I am on my travels . May we both have new selves better than the old selves , when we again shake hands ! For your part try your best , dear Tom , and Heaven prosper you . "
94244	94250	94252	94252	Tom	359	" And Heaven bless you ! "
94346	94360	94336	94336	he	261	" Alas ! I have soon got back again into my own skin . "
94502	94506	94507	94507	he	261	" I feel , "
94513	94550	94507	94507	he	261	" like poor Lord Pomfret , who , charmed with Punch 's lively conversation , bought him , and was greatly surprised that , when he had once brought him home , Punch would not talk . "
94551	94557	94559	94560	Mrs. Campion	396	" But your Punch listens , "
94562	94567	94559	94560	Mrs. Campion	396	" and he observes . "
94695	94704	94688	94688	Kenelm	261	" There is much in what you say . "
94923	94933	94915	94931	a man who says in his heart , " If this creature would but leave me alone	7982	" If this creature would but leave me alone ! "
95459	95473	95455	95455	he	399	" The study of life is a science , and not an art . "
95586	95645	95576	95576	he	399	" Kenelm Chillingly , now that thou hast got back into thy proper skin , dost thou not think that thou hadst better remain there ? Couldst thou not be contented with thy lot as erring descendant of Adam , if thou couldst win for thy mate so faultless a descendant of Eve as now flits before thee ? "
95700	95706	95686	95686	Cecilia	364	" Do you admire Virgil ? "
95707	95736	95666	95666	he	399	" To say truth I have not read Virgil since I was a boy ; and , between you and me , I then thought him rather monotonous . "
95737	95749	95686	95686	Cecilia	364	" Perhaps because his verse is so smooth in its beauty ? "
95750	95783	95666	95666	he	399	" Probably . When one is very young one 's taste is faulty ; and if a poet is not faulty , we are apt to think he wants vivacity and fire . "
95784	95792	95794	95794	Kenelm	261	" Thank you for your lucid explanation , "
95801	95819	95799	95799	himself	261	" I am afraid I should yawn very often if I were married to a Miss Virgil . "
95939	95952	95954	95954	Kenelm	261	" I do n't pretend to be a good judge of paintings , "
95962	96007	95957	95957	Cecilia	364	" but it strikes me that this picture is very much better than most of those to which places of honour are assigned in your collection . And the face itself is so lovely that it would add an embellishment to the princeliest galleries . "
96008	96011	96013	96013	Cecilia	364	" Yes , "
96021	96064	96013	96013	Cecilia	364	" The face is lovely , and the portrait is considered one of Lely 's rarest masterpieces . It used to hang over the chimney - piece in the drawing - room . My father had it placed here many years ago . "
96065	96077	95957	95957	Cecilia	364	" Perhaps because he discovered it was not a family portrait ? "
96078	96129	96013	96013	Cecilia	364	" On the contrary , - because it grieves him to think it is a family portrait . Hush ! I hear his footstep : do n't speak of it to him ; do n't let him see you looking at it . The subject is very painful to him . "
96304	96307	96309	96309	Travers	399	" Cissy ! "
96330	96351	96324	96324	he	399	" Cissy ! How comes this ? We have taken the wrong turn ! No matter , I see there , "
96357	96430	96324	96324	he	399	" the chimney - pots of old Mondell 's homestead . He has not yet promised his vote to George Belvoir . I 'll go and have a talk with him . Turn back , you and Mr. Chillingly , - meet me at Terner 's Green , and wait for me there till I come . I need not excuse myself to you , Chillingly . A vote is a vote . "
96726	96732	96734	96735	Miss Travers	364	" Let us turn back , "
96737	96748	96734	96735	Miss Travers	364	" my father would not like me to stay here . "
96749	96784	96840	96840	Cecilia	364	" Pardon me a moment . I wish my father were here ; he would stay till sunset . But what is the history of that old tower ? a history it must have . "
96785	96798	96800	96800	Cecilia	364	" Every home has a history , even a peasant 's hut , "
96802	96826	96800	96800	Cecilia	364	" But do pardon me if I ask you to comply with my father 's request . I at least must turn back . "
96853	96865	96867	96867	Kenelm	261	" I am far from a very inquisitive man by temperament , "
96926	96926	96920	96920	I	0	"
96927	96939	96941	96941	Cecilia	364	" Its most melancholy associations are with a very recent past , "
96943	97252	96941	96941	Cecilia	364	" The tower , in remote times , formed the keep of a castle belonging to the most ancient and once the most powerful family in these parts . The owners were barons who took active share in the Wars of the Roses . The last of them sided with Richard III . , and after the battle of Bosworth the title was attainted , and the larger portion of the lands was confiscated . Loyalty to a Plantagenet was of course treason to a Tudor . But the regeneration of the family rested with their direct descendants , who had saved from the general wreck of their fortunes what may be called a good squire 's estate , - about , perhaps , the same rental as my father 's , but of much larger acreage . These squires , however , were more looked up to in the county than the wealthiest peer . They were still by far the oldest family in the county ; and traced in their pedigree alliances with the most illustrious houses in English history . In themselves too for many generations they were a high - spirited , hospitable , popular race , living unostentatiously on their income , and contented with their rank of squires . The castle , ruined by time and siege , they did not attempt to restore . They dwelt in a house near to it , built about Elizabeth 's time , which you could not see , for it lies in a hollow behind the tower , - a moderate - sized , picturesque , country gentleman 's house . Our family intermarried with them , - the portrait you saw was a daughter of their house , - and very proud was any squire in the county of intermarriage with the Fletwodes . "
97253	97292	96920	96920	I	0	" Fletwode , - that was their name ? I have a vague recollection of having heard the name connected with some disastrous - oh , but it ca n't be the same family : pray go on . "
97293	97372	96941	96941	Cecilia	364	" I fear it is the same family . But I will finish the story as I have heard it . The property descended at last to one Bertram Fletwode , who , unfortunately , obtained the reputation of being a very clever man of business . There was some mining company in which , with other gentlemen in the county , he took great interest ; invested largely in shares ; became the head of the direction - "
97373	97383	96920	96920	I	0	" I see ; and was of course ruined . "
97384	97529	96941	96941	Cecilia	364	" No ; worse than that : he became very rich ; and , unhappily , became desirous of being richer still . I have heard that there was a great mania for speculations just about that time . He embarked in these , and prospered , till at last he was induced to invest a large share of the fortune thus acquired in the partnership of a bank which enjoyed a high character . Up to that time he had retained popularity and esteem in the county ; but the squires who shared in the adventures of the mining company , and knew little or nothing about other speculations in which his name did not appear , professed to be shocked at the idea of a Fletwode of Fletwode being ostensibly joined in partnership with a Jones of Clapham in a London bank . "
97530	97548	96920	96920	I	0	" Slow folks , those country squires , - behind the progress of the age . Well ? "
97549	97722	96941	96941	Cecilia	364	" I have heard that Bertram Fletwode was himself very reluctant to take this step , but was persuaded to do so by his son . This son , Alfred , was said to have still greater talents for business than the father , and had been not only associated with but consulted by him in all the later speculations which had proved so fortunate . Mrs. Campion knew Alfred Fletwode very well . She describes him as handsome , with quick , eager eyes ; showy and imposing in his talk ; immensely ambitious , more ambitious than avaricious , - collecting money less for its own sake than for that which it could give , - rank and power . According to her it was the dearest wish of his heart to claim the old barony , but not before there could go with the barony a fortune adequate to the lustre of a title so ancient , and equal to the wealth of modern peers with higher nominal rank . "
97723	97847	96920	96920	I	0	" A poor ambition at the best ; of the two I should prefer that of a poet in a garret . But I am no judge . Thank Heaven I have no ambition . Still , all ambition , all desire to rise , is interesting to him who is ignominiously contented if he does not fall . So the son had his way , and Fletwode joined company with Jones on the road to wealth and the peerage ; meanwhile did the son marry ? if so , of course the daughter of a duke or a millionnaire . Tuft - hunting , or money - making , at the risk of degradation and the workhouse . Progress of the age ! "
97848	97851	97853	97853	Cecilia	364	" No , "
97864	97954	97853	97853	Cecilia	364	" Fletwode did not marry the daughter of a duke or a millionnaire ; but still his wife belonged to a noble family , - very poor , but very proud . Perhaps he married from motives of ambition , though not of gain . Her father was of much political influence that might perhaps assist his claim to the barony . The mother , a woman of the world , enjoying a high social position , and nearly related to a connection of ours , - Lady Glenalvon . "
97955	97972	96920	96920	I	0	" Lady Glenalvon , the dearest of my lady friends ! You are connected with her ? "
97973	98240	97853	97853	Cecilia	364	" Yes ; Lord Glenalvon was my mother 's uncle . But I wish to finish my story before my father joins us . Alfred Fletwode did not marry till long after the partnership in the bank . His father , at his desire , had bought up the whole business , Mr. Jones having died . The bank was carried on in the names of Fletwode and Son . But the father had become merely a nominal or what I believe is called a ' sleeping ' partner . He had long ceased to reside in the county . The old house was not grand enough for him . He had purchased a palatial residence in one of the home counties ; lived there in great splendour ; was a munificent patron of science and art ; and in spite of his earlier addictions to business - like speculations he appears to have been a singularly accomplished , high - bred gentleman . Some years before his son 's marriage , Mr. Fletwode had been afflicted with partial paralysis , and his medical attendant enjoined rigid abstention from business . From that time he never interfered with his son 's management of the bank . He had an only daughter , much younger than Alfred . Lord Eagleton , my mother 's brother , was engaged to be married to her . The wedding - day was fixed , - when the world was startled by the news that the great firm of Fletwode and Son had stopped payment ; is that the right phrase ? "
98241	98246	96920	96920	I	0	" I believe so . "
98247	98472	97853	97853	Cecilia	364	" A great many people were ruined in that failure . The public indignation was very great . Of course all the Fletwode property went to the creditors . Old Mr. Fletwode was legally acquitted of all other offence than that of overconfidence in his son . Alfred was convicted of fraud , - of forgery . I do n't , of course , know the particulars , they are very complicated . He was sentenced to a long term of servitude , but died the day he was condemned ; apparently by poison , which he had long secreted about his person . Now you can understand why my father , who is almost gratuitously sensitive on the point of honour , removed into a dark corner the portrait of Arabella Fletwode , - his own ancestress , but also the ancestress of a convicted felon : you can understand why the whole subject is so painful to him . His wife 's brother was to have married the felon 's sister ; and though , of course , that marriage was tacitly broken off by the terrible disgrace that had befallen the Fletwodes , yet I do n't think my poor uncle ever recovered the blow to his hopes . He went abroad , and died in Madeira of a slow decline . "
98473	98485	96920	96920	I	0	" And the felon 's sister , did she die too ? "
98486	98533	97853	97853	Cecilia	364	" No ; not that I know of . Mrs. Campion says that she saw in a newspaper the announcement of old Mr. Fletwode 's death , and a paragraph to the effect that after that event Miss Fletwode had sailed from Liverpool to New York . "
98534	98549	96920	96920	I	0	" Alfred Fletwode 's wife went back , of course , to her family ? "
98550	98699	97853	97853	Cecilia	364	" Alas ! no , - poor thing ! She had not been many months married when the bank broke ; and among his friends her wretched husband appears to have forged the names of the trustees to her marriage settlement , and sold out the sums which would otherwise have served her as a competence . Her father , too , was a great sufferer by the bankruptcy , having by his son - in - law 's advice placed a considerable portion of his moderate fortune in Alfred 's hands for investment , all of which was involved in the general wreck . I am afraid he was a very hard - hearted man : at all events his poor daughter never returned to him . She died , I think , even before the death of Bertram Fletwode . The whole story is very dismal . "
98700	99052	96920	96920	I	0	" Dismal indeed , but pregnant with salutary warnings to those who live in an age of progress . Here you see a family of fair fortune , living hospitably , beloved , revered , more looked up to by their neighbours than the wealthiest nobles ; no family not proud to boast alliance with it . All at once , in the tranquil record of this happy race , appears that darling of the age , that hero of progress , - a clever man of business . He be contented to live as his fathers ! He be contented with such trifles as competence , respect , and love ! Much too clever for that . The age is money - making , - go with the age ! He goes with the age . Born a gentleman only , he exalts himself into a trader . But at least he , it seems , if greedy , was not dishonest . He was born a gentleman , but his son was born a trader . The son is a still cleverer man of business ; the son is consulted and trusted . Aha ! He too goes with the age ; to greed he links ambition . The trader 's son wishes to return - what ? to the rank of gentleman ? - gentleman ! nonsense ! everybody is a gentleman nowadays , - to the title of Lord . How ends it all ! Could I sit but for twelve hours in the innermost heart of that Alfred Fletwode ; could I see how , step by step from his childhood , the dishonest son was avariciously led on by the honest father to depart from the old vestigia of Fletwodes of Fletwode , - scorning The Enough to covet The More , gaining The More to sigh , ' It is not The Enough , ' - I think I might show that the age lives in a house of glass , and had better not for its own sake throw stones on the felon ! "
99053	99072	97853	97853	Cecilia	364	" Ah , but , Mr. Chillingly , surely this is a very rare exception in the general - "
99073	99076	96920	96920	I	0	" Rare ! "
99108	99438	97853	97853	Cecilia	364	" rare ! nay , how common - I do n't say to the extent of forgery and fraud , but to the extent of degradation and ruin - is the greed of a Little More to those who have The Enough ! is the discontent with competence , respect , and love , when catching sight of a money - bag ! How many well - descended county families , cursed with an heir who is called a clever man of business , have vanished from the soil ! A company starts , the clever man joins it one bright day . Pouf ! the old estates and the old name are powder . Ascend higher . Take nobles whose ancestral titles ought to be to English ears like the sound of clarions , awakening the most slothful to the scorn of money - bags and the passion for renown . Lo ! in that mocking dance of death called the Progress of the Age , one who did not find Enough in a sovereign 's revenue , and seeks The Little More as a gambler on the turf by the advice of blacklegs ! Lo ! another , with lands wider than his greatest ancestors ever possessed , must still go in for The Little More , adding acre to acre , heaping debt upon debt ! Lo ! a third , whose name , borne by his ancestors , was once the terror of England 's foes , - the landlord of a hotel ! A fourth , - but why go on through the list ? Another and another still succeeds ; each on the Road to Ruin , each in the Age of Progress . Ah , Miss Travers ! in the old time it was through the Temple of Honour that one passed to the Temple of Fortune . In this wise age the process is reversed . But here comes your father . "
99439	99444	99446	99447	Leopold Travers	399	" A thousand pardons ! "
99449	99535	99446	99447	Leopold Travers	399	" That numskull Mondell kept me so long with his old - fashioned Tory doubts whether liberal politics are favourable to agricultural prospects . But as he owes a round sum to a Whig lawyer I had to talk with his wife , a prudent woman ; convinced her that his own agricultural prospects were safest on the Whig side of the question ; and , after kissing his baby and shaking his hand , booked his vote for George Belvoir , - a plumper . "
99536	99540	99544	99544	himself	261	" I suppose , "
99559	99596	99552	99552	him	261	" that Travers has taken the right road to the Temple , not of Honour , but of honours , in every country , ancient or modern , which has adopted the system of popular suffrage . "
99654	99666	99649	99651	MRS . CAMPION	396	" Has Mr. Chillingly said when he means to take leave ? "
99670	99684	99667	99667	CECILIA	364	" Not to me . How much my dear father enjoys his conversation ! "
99690	99769	99685	99687	MRS . CAMPION	396	" Cynicism and mockery were not so much the fashion among young men in your father 's day as I suppose they are now , and therefore they seem new to Mr. Travers . To me they are not new , because I saw more of the old than the young when I lived in London , and cynicism and mockery are more natural to men who are leaving the world than to those who are entering it . "
99773	99820	99770	99770	CECILIA	364	" Dear Mrs. Campion , how bitter you are , and how unjust ! You take much too literally the jesting way in which Mr. Chillingly expresses himself . There can be no cynicism in one who goes out of his way to make others happy . "
99826	99865	99821	99823	MRS . CAMPION	396	" You mean in the whim of making an ill - assorted marriage between a pretty village flirt and a sickly cripple , and settling a couple of peasants in a business for which they are wholly unfitted . "
99869	99902	99866	99866	CECILIA	364	" Jessie Wiles is not a flirt , and I am convinced that she will make Will Somers a very good wife , and that the shop will be a great success . "
99908	99939	99903	99905	MRS . CAMPION	396	" We shall see . Still , if Mr. Chillingly 's talk belies his actions , he may be a good man , but he is a very affected one . "
99943	99968	99940	99940	CECILIA	364	" Have I not heard you say that there are persons so natural that they seem affected to those who do not understand them ? "
99994	100000	99972	99972	her	396	" Take care , Cecilia . "
100001	100007	99972	99972	her	396	" Take care of what ? "
100008	100030	99972	99972	her	396	" My dearest child , forgive me ; but I do not like the warmth with which you defend Mr. Chillingly . "
100031	100047	99972	99972	her	396	" Would not my father defend him still more warmly if he had heard you ? "
100048	100093	99972	99972	her	396	" Men judge of men in their relations to men . I am a woman , and judge of men in their relations to women . I should tremble for the happiness of any woman who joined her fate with that of Kenelm Chillingly . "
100094	100108	99972	99972	her	396	" My dear friend , I do not understand you to - day . "
100109	100166	99972	99972	her	396	" Nay ; I did not mean to be so solemn , my love . After all , it is nothing to us whom Mr. Chillingly may or may not marry . He is but a passing visitor , and , once gone , the chances are that we may not see him again for years . "
100344	100349	100339	100339	herself	6862	" Do I love ? "
100370	100375	100339	100339	herself	6862	" Do I love ? "
100434	100437	100440	100445	a girl of such a nature	2907	" yes . "
100451	100453	100440	100445	a girl of such a nature	2907	" yes "
100539	100542	100521	100521	she	396	" yes . "
100688	100701	100703	100703	Kenelm	261	" I have been visiting the man you have made so happy , "
100705	100711	100673	100673	he	2913	" Who can that be ? "
100712	100734	100673	100673	he	2913	" Will Somers . Do you make so many people happy that your reminiscence of them is lost in their number ? "
100748	100822	100744	100744	Kenelm	261	" I have also seen Mrs. Bowles , and you will be pleased to hear that Tom is satisfied with his change of abode : there is no chance of his returning to Graveleigh ; and Mrs. Bowles took very kindly to my suggestion that the little property you wish for should be sold to you , and , in that case , she would remove to Luscombe to be near her son . "
100823	100834	100836	100836	Travers	364	" I thank you much for your thought of me , "
100838	100961	100836	100836	Travers	364	" and the affair shall be seen to at once , though the purchase is no longer important to me . I ought to have told you three days ago , but it slipped my memory , that a neighbouring squire , a young fellow just come into his property , has offered to exchange a capital farm , much nearer to my residence , for the lands I hold in Graveleigh , including Saunderson 's farm and the cottages : they are quite at the outskirts of my estate , but run into his , and the exchange will be advantageous to both . Still I am glad that the neighbourhood should be thoroughly rid of a brute like Tom Bowles . "
100962	100989	100744	100744	Kenelm	261	" You would not call him brute if you knew him ; but I am sorry to hear that Will Somers will be under another landlord . "
100990	101005	100836	100836	Travers	364	" It does not matter , since his tenure is secured for fourteen years . "
101006	101016	100744	100744	Kenelm	261	" What sort of man is the new landlord ? "
101017	101077	100836	100836	Travers	364	" I do n't know much of him . He was in the army till his father died , and has only just made his appearance in the county . He has , however , already earned the character of being too fond of the other sex : it is well that pretty Jessie is to be safely married . "
101103	101164	101097	101098	the latter	1650	" My dear Mr. Travers , do not think I take a liberty if I venture to guess that something has happened this morning which troubles or vexes you . When that is the case , it is often a relief to say what it is , even to a confidant so unable to advise or to comfort as myself . "
101165	101214	101215	101215	he	261	" You are a good fellow , Chillingly , and I know not , at least in these parts , a man to whom I would unburden myself more freely . I am put out , I confess ; disappointed unreasonably , in a cherished wish , and , "
101223	101237	101215	101215	he	261	" it always annoys me when I do n't have my own way . "
101238	101244	101097	101098	the latter	1650	" So it does me . "
101245	101260	101215	101215	he	261	" Do n't you think that George Belvoir is a very fine young man ? "
101261	101264	101097	101098	the latter	1650	" Certainly . "
101265	101324	101215	101215	he	261	" I call him handsome ; he is steadier , too , than most men of his age , and of his command of money ; and yet he does not want spirit nor knowledge of life . To every advantage of rank and fortune he adds the industry and the ambition which attain distinction in public life . "
101325	101340	101097	101098	the latter	1650	" Quite true . Is he going to withdraw from the election after all ? "
101341	101347	101215	101215	he	261	" Good heavens , no ! "
101348	101361	101097	101098	the latter	1650	" Then how does he not let you have your own way ? "
101362	101368	101370	101370	Travers	393	" It is not he , "
101374	101418	101370	101370	Travers	393	" it is Cecilia . Do n't you understand that George is precisely the husband I would choose for her ; and this morning came a very well written manly letter from him , asking my permission to pay his addresses to her . "
101419	101429	101097	101098	the latter	1650	" But that is your own way so far . "
101430	101527	101370	101370	Travers	393	" Yes , and here comes the balk . Of course I had to refer it to Cecilia , and she positively declines , and has no reasons to give ; does not deny that George is good - looking and sensible , that he is a man of whose preference any girl might be proud ; but she chooses to say she can not love him , and when I ask why she can not love him , has no other answer than that ' she can not say . ' It is too provoking . "
101528	101533	101535	101535	Kenelm	261	" It is provoking , "
101537	101657	101535	101535	Kenelm	261	" but then Love is the most dunderheaded of all the passions ; it never will listen to reason . The very rudiments of logic are unknown to it . ' Love has no wherefore , ' says one of those Latin poets who wrote love - verses called elegies , - a name which we moderns appropriate to funeral dirges . For my own part , I ca n't understand how any one can be expected voluntarily to make up his mind to go out of his mind . And if Miss Travers can not go out of her mind because George Belvoir does , you could not argue her into doing so if you talked till doomsday . "
101670	101779	101666	101666	he	393	" Certainly , I would not wish Cissy to marry any man she disliked , but she does not dislike George ; no girl could : and where that is the case , a girl so sensible , so affectionate , so well brought up , is sure to love , after marriage , a thoroughly kind and estimable man , especially when she has no previous attachment , - which , of course , Cissy never had . In fact , though I do not wish to force my daughter 's will , I am not yet disposed to give up my own . Do you understand ? "
101780	101783	101370	101370	Travers	393	" Perfectly . "
101784	101861	101666	101666	he	393	" I am the more inclined to a marriage so desirable in every way , because when Cissy comes out in London , which she has not yet done , she is sure to collect round her face and her presumptive inheritance all the handsome fortune - hunters and titled vauriens ; and if in love there is no wherefore , how can I be sure that she may not fall in love with a scamp ? "
101862	101872	101874	101874	Kenelm	261	" I think you may be sure of that , "
101876	101884	101874	101874	Kenelm	261	" Miss Travers has too much mind . "
101885	101906	101666	101666	he	393	" Yes , at present ; but did you not say that in love people go out of their mind ? "
101907	101914	101874	101874	Kenelm	261	" True ! I forgot that . "
101915	101958	101666	101666	he	393	" I am not then disposed to dismiss poor George 's offer with a decided negative , and yet it would be unfair to mislead him by encouragement . In fact , I 'll be hanged if I know how to reply . "
101959	102004	101874	101874	Kenelm	261	" You think Miss Travers does not dislike George Belvoir , and if she saw more of him may like him better , and it would be good for her as well as for him not to put an end to that , chance ? "
102005	102009	101666	101666	he	393	" Exactly so . "
102010	102094	101874	101874	Kenelm	261	" Why not then write : ' My dear George , - You have my best wishes , but my daughter does not seem disposed to marry at present . Let me consider your letter not written , and continue on the same terms as we were before . ' Perhaps , as George knows Virgil , you might find your own schoolboy recollections of that poet useful here , and add , Varium et mutabile semper femina ; hackneyed , but true . "
102095	102121	102122	102122	Kenelm	261	" My dear Chillingly , your suggestion is capital . How the deuce at your age have you contrived to know the world so well ? "
102134	102145	102122	102122	Kenelm	261	" By being only a looker - on ; alas ! "
102471	102478	102480	102480	Kenelm	261	" Is the delight in scenery , "
102482	102531	102480	102480	Kenelm	261	" really an acquired gift , as some philosophers tell us ? Is it true that young children and rude savages do not feel it ; that the eye must be educated to comprehend its charm , and that the eye can be only educated through the mind ? "
102532	102541	102543	102543	Travers	399	" I should think your philosophers are right , "
102545	102614	102543	102543	Travers	399	" When I was a schoolboy , I thought no scenery was like the flat of a cricket ground ; when I hunted at Melton , I thought that unpicturesque country more beautiful than Devonshire . It is only of late years that I feel a sensible pleasure in scenery for its own sake , apart from associations of custom or the uses to which we apply them . "
102615	102624	102480	102480	Kenelm	261	" And what say you , Miss Travers ? "
102625	102633	102635	102635	Cecilia	364	" I scarcely know what to say , "
102639	102704	102635	102635	Cecilia	364	" I can remember no time in my childhood when I did not feel delight in that which seemed to me beautiful in scenery , but I suspect that I vaguely distinguished one kind of beauty from another . A common field with daisies and buttercups was beautiful to me then , and I doubt if I saw anything more beautiful in extensive landscapes . "
102705	102708	102710	102710	Kenelm	261	" True , "
102712	102766	102710	102710	Kenelm	261	" it is not in early childhood that we carry the sight into distance : as is the mind so is the eye ; in early childhood the mind revels in the present , and the eye rejoices most in the things nearest to it . I do n't think in childhood that we -
102767	102778	102635	102635	Cecilia	364	" ' Watched with wistful eyes the setting sun . ' "
102779	102794	102796	102796	Cecilia	364	" Ah ! what a world of thought in that word ' wistful ' ! "
102934	102950	103077	103078	the bailiff	2449	" No sign of rain yet , Squire . What will become of the turnips ? "
102951	102961	102963	102963	Kenelm	261	" Real life again ! Who can escape it ? "
102979	102984	102986	102986	Travers	363	" Ha ! North , "
102988	103001	102986	102986	Travers	363	" what brings you here ? No bad news , I hope ? "
103002	103013	103077	103078	the bailiff	2449	" Indeed , yes , Squire . The Durham bull - "
103014	103027	102986	102986	Travers	363	" The Durham bull ! What of him ? You frighten me . "
103028	103034	103077	103078	the bailiff	2449	" Taken bad . Colic . "
103035	103041	103043	103043	Travers	363	" Excuse me , Chillingly , "
103045	103068	103043	103043	Travers	363	" I must be off . A most valuable animal , and no one I can trust to doctor him but myself . "
103069	103075	103077	103078	the bailiff	2449	" That 's true enough , "
103082	103095	103077	103078	the bailiff	2449	" There 's not a veterinary in the county like the Squire . "
103123	103130	103132	103132	he	261	" How I envy your father ! "
103134	103151	103153	103153	Cecilia	364	" Why just at this moment , - because he knows how to doctor the bull ? "
103161	103190	103115	103115	himself	261	" Well , that is something to envy . It is a pleasure to relieve from pain any of God 's creatures , - even a Durham bull . "
103191	103201	103115	103115	himself	261	" Indeed , yes . I am justly rebuked . "
103202	103286	103115	103115	himself	261	" On the contrary you are to be justly praised . Your question suggested to me an amiable sentiment in place of the selfish one which was uppermost in my thoughts . I envied your father because he creates for himself so many objects of interest ; because while he can appreciate the mere sensuous enjoyment of a landscape and a sunset , he can find mental excitement in turnip crops and bulls . Happy , Miss Travers , is the Practical Man . "
103287	103337	103115	103115	himself	261	" When my dear father was as young as you , Mr. Chillingly , I am sure that he had no more interest in turnips and bulls than you have . I do not doubt that some day you will be as practical as he is in that respect . "
103338	103346	103115	103115	himself	261	" Do you think so - sincerely ? "
103357	103422	103352	103352	Kenelm	261	" Sincerely , then , I do not know whether you will take interest in precisely the same things that interest my father ; but there are other things than turnips and cattle which belong to what you call ' practical life , ' and in these you will take interest , as you took in the fortunes of Will Somers and Jessie Wiles . "
103423	103475	103115	103115	himself	261	" That was no practical interest . I got nothing by it . But even if that interest were practical , - I mean productive , as cattle and turnip crops are , - a succession of Somerses and Wileses is not to be hoped for . History never repeats itself . "
103476	103486	103352	103352	Kenelm	261	" May I answer you , though very humbly ? "
103487	103557	103115	103115	himself	261	" Miss Travers , the wisest man that ever existed never was wise enough to know woman ; but I think most men ordinarily wise will agree in this , that woman is by no means a humble creature , and that when she says she ' answers very humbly , ' she does not mean what she says . Permit me to entreat you to answer very loftily . "
103611	103659	103603	103603	she	364	" Are there not things very practical , and affecting the happiness , not of one or two individuals , but of innumerable thousands , in which a man like Mr. Chillingly can not fail to feel interest , long before he is my father 's age ? "
103660	103691	103603	103603	she	364	" Forgive me : you do not answer ; you question . I imitate you , and ask what are those things as applicable to a man like Mr. Chillingly ? "
103715	103732	103694	103694	herself	364	" In the expression of thought , literature ; in the conduct of action , politics . "
103778	103781	103694	103694	herself	364	" laconics . "
103782	103786	103787	103787	he	2942	" No woman , "
103794	103803	103787	103787	he	2942	" ever invented an axiom or a proverb . "
103804	103808	103809	103809	he	2942	" Miss Travers , "
103814	103854	103809	103809	he	2942	" before we proceed further , vouchsafe to tell me if that very terse reply of yours is spontaneous and original ; or whether you have not borrowed it from some book which I have not chanced to read ? "
103863	103897	103809	103809	he	2942	" I do n't think it is from any book ; but I owe so many of my thoughts to Mrs. Campion , and she lived so much among clever men , that - "
103898	103942	103694	103694	herself	364	" I see it all , and accept your definition , no matter whence it came . You think I might become an author or a politician . Did you ever read an essay by a living author called ' Motive Power ' ? "
103943	103946	103809	103809	he	2942	" No . "
103947	104058	103694	103694	herself	364	" That essay is designed to intimate that without motive power a man , whatever his talents or his culture , does nothing practical . The mainsprings of motive power are Want and Ambition . They are absent from my mechanism . By the accident of birth I do not require bread and cheese ; by the accident of temperament and of philosophical culture I care nothing about praise or blame . But without want of bread and cheese , and with a most stolid indifference to praise and blame , do you honestly think that a man will do anything practical in literature or politics ? Ask Mrs. Campion . "
104059	104073	103809	103809	he	2942	" I will not ask her . Is the sense of duty nothing ? "
104074	104215	103694	103694	herself	364	" Alas ! we interpret duty so variously . Of mere duty , as we commonly understand the word , I do not think I shall fail more than other men . But for the fair development of all the good that is in us , do you believe that we should adopt some line of conduct against which our whole heart rebels ? Can you say to the clerk , ' Be a poet ' ? Can you say to the poet , ' Be a clerk ' ? It is no more to the happiness of a man 's being to order him to take to one career when his whole heart is set on another , than it is to order him to marry one woman when it is to another woman that his heart will turn . "
104300	104395	104296	104296	he	261	" Happiness is a word very lightly used . It may mean little ; it may mean much . By the word happiness I would signify , not the momentary joy of a child who gets a plaything , but the lasting harmony between our inclinations and our objects ; and without that harmony we are a discord to ourselves , we are incompletions , we are failures . Yet there are plenty of advisers who say to us , ' It is a duty to be a discord . ' I deny it . "
104406	104417	104397	104397	Cecilia	364	" It is getting late . We must go homeward . "
104475	104481	104483	104483	Kenelm	261	" The bats are practical , "
104485	104524	104483	104483	Kenelm	261	" they are hungry , and their motive power to - night is strong . Their interest is in the insects they chase . They have no interest in the stars ; but the stars lure the moth . "
104549	104552	104554	104554	she	364	" Yet , "
104556	104563	104554	104554	she	364	" the moth is practical too . "
104564	104589	104606	104606	she	364	" Ay , just now , since it has found an asylum from the danger that threatened it in its course towards the stars . "
104646	104649	104650	104650	he	261	" See , "
104653	104772	104650	104650	he	261	" the moon has just risen over those dark firs , making the still night stiller . Is it not strange that we mortals , placed amid perpetual agitation and tumult and strife , as if our natural element , conceive a sense of holiness in the images antagonistic to our real life ; I mean in images of repose ? I feel at the moment as if I suddenly were made better , now that heaven and earth have suddenly become yet more tranquil . I am now conscious of a purer and sweeter moral than either I or you drew from the insect you have sheltered . I must come to the poets to express it , -
104773	104803	104642	104642	he	261	" ' The desire of the moth for the star , Of the night for the morrow ; The devotion to something afar From the sphere of our sorrow . '
104804	104828	104650	104650	he	261	" Oh , that something afar ! that something afar ! never to be reached on this earth , - never , never ! "
104904	104918	104921	104922	Mr. Travers	393	" I am happy to tell you that I have saved my Durham , "
105041	105047	105049	105049	Kenelm	261	" What a speaking homily , "
105055	105214	105215	105215	He	2960	" against the ambition thy fair descendant would awake in me , art thou , O lovely image ! For generations thy beauty lived in this canvas , a thing of joy , the pride of the race it adorned . Owner after owner said to admiring guests , ' Yes , a fine portrait , by Lely ; she was my ancestress , - a Fletwode of Fletwode . ' Now , lest guests should remember that a Fletwode married a Travers thou art thrust out of sight ; not even Lely 's art can make thee of value , can redeem thine innocent self from disgrace . And the last of the Fletwodes , doubtless the most ambitious of all , the most bent on restoring and regilding the old lordly name , dies a felon ; the infamy of one living man is so large that it can blot out the honour of the dead . "
105288	105291	105292	105292	he	2960	" Kenelm , "
105304	105546	105292	105292	he	2960	" it becomes you , forsooth , to moralize about the honour of races which have no affinity with you . Son of Sir Peter Chillingly , look at home . Are you quite sure that you have not said or done or looked a something that may bring trouble to the hearth on which you are received as guest ? What right had you to be moaning forth your egotisms , not remembering that your words fell on compassionate ears , and that such words , heard at moonlight by a girl whose heart they move to pity , may have dangers for her peace ? Shame on you , Kenelm ! shame ! knowing too what her father 's wish is ; and knowing too that you have not the excuse of desiring to win that fair creature for yourself . What do you mean , Kenelm ? I do n't hear you ; speak out . Oh , ' that I am a vain coxcomb to fancy that she could take a fancy to me : ' well , perhaps I am ; I hope so earnestly ; and at all events , there has been and shall be no time for much mischief . We are off to - morrow , Kenelm ; bestir yourself and pack up , write your letters , and then ' put out the light , - put out the light ! ' "

But if any case requiring extra funds should occur , - a case in which that extra would do such real good to another that I feel you would do it , - why , I must draw a check on your bankers . But understand that is your expense , not mine , and it is you who are to be repaid in Heaven . Dear father , how I do love and honour you every day more and more !

I could not have obeyed you more cheerfully if you had asked me to promise never to propose to any young lady at all . Had you asked me to promise that I would renounce the dignity of reason for the frenzy of love , or the freedom of man for the servitude of husband , then I might have sought to achieve the impossible ; but I should have died in the effort ! - and thou wouldst have known that remorse which haunts the bed of the tyrant .
107443	107450	107452	107452	he	261	" The summer is wearing away , "
107454	107483	107452	107452	he	261	" and I have far to go before the flowers fade and the snows fall . On the third night from this I shall sleep on foreign soil . "
107484	107492	107494	107495	Mrs. Campion	396	" You are going abroad , then ? "
107497	107500	107452	107452	he	261	" Yes . "
107501	107520	107452	107452	he	261	" A sudden resolution , Mr. Chillingly . The other day you talked of visiting the Scotch lakes . "
107521	107557	107452	107452	he	261	" True ; but , on reflection , they will be crowded with holiday tourists , many of whom I shall probably know . Abroad I shall be free , for I shall be unknown . "
107558	107570	107572	107572	Travers	364	" I suppose you will be back for the hunting season , "
107574	107585	107452	107452	he	261	" I think not . I do not hunt foxes . "
107586	107597	107599	107599	Travers	364	" Probably we shall at all events meet in London , "
107601	107656	107599	107599	Travers	364	" I think , after long rustication , that a season or two in the bustling capital may be a salutary change for mind as well as for body ; and it is time that Cecilia were presented and her court - dress specially commemorated in the columns of the ' Morning Post . ' "
107675	107682	107684	107684	Travers	364	" I shall miss you terribly , "
107697	107722	107684	107684	Travers	364	" I declare that you have quite unsettled me . Your quaint sayings will be ringing in my ears long after you are gone . "
107744	107747	107749	107750	Mrs. Campion	396	" Cissy , "
107752	107761	107749	107750	Mrs. Campion	396	" are we ever to have our tea ? "
107762	107767	107769	107773	a voice behind the urn	3043	" I beg pardon , "
107775	107779	107769	107773	a voice behind the urn	3043	" I hear Pompey "
107783	107801	107769	107773	a voice behind the urn	3043	" whining on the lawn . They have shut him out . I will be back presently . "
107819	107835	107837	107837	Travers	364	" It is quite absurd of Cissy to be so fond of that hideous dog , "
107841	107848	107850	107851	Mrs. Campion	396	" Its hideousness is its beauty , "
107855	107880	107850	107851	Mrs. Campion	396	" Mr. Belvoir selected it for her as having the longest back and the shortest legs of any dog he could find in Scotland . "
107881	107894	107896	107896	Travers	364	" Ah , George gave it to her ; I forgot that , "
108068	108074	108075	108075	she	364	" Thank you , dear , "
109482	109485	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" Yes , "
109501	109698	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" I think there will be an opening at Saxboro ' soon : Milroy wants a Colonial Government ; and if we can reconstruct the Cabinet as I propose , he would get one . Saxboro ' would thus be vacant . But , my dear fellow , Saxboro ' is a place to be wooed through love , and only won through money . It demands liberalism from a candidate , - two kinds of liberalism seldom united ; the liberalism in opinion which is natural enough to a very poor man , and the liberalism in expenditure which is scarcely to be obtained except from a very rich one . You may compute the cost of Saxboro ' at L3000 to get in , and about L2000 more to defend your seat against a petition , - the defeated candidate nearly always petitions . L5000 is a large sum ; and the worst of it is , that the extreme opinions to which the member for Saxboro ' must pledge himself are a drawback to an official career . Violent politicians are not the best raw material out of which to manufacture fortunate placemen . "
109699	109722	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" The opinions do not so much matter ; the expense does . I can not afford L5000 , or even L3000 . "
109723	109754	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" Would not Sir Peter assist ? He has , you say , only one son ; and if anything happen to that son , you are the next heir . "
109755	109830	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" My father quarrelled with Sir Peter , and harassed him by an imprudent and ungracious litigation . I scarcely think I could apply to him for money to obtain a seat in Parliament upon the democratic side of the question ; for , though I know little of his politics , I take it for granted that a country gentleman of old family and L10,000 a year can not well be a democrat . "
109831	109857	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" Then I presume you would not be a democrat if , by the death of your cousin , you became heir to the Chillinglys . "
109858	109893	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" I am not sure what I might be in that case . There are times when a democrat of ancient lineage and good estates could take a very high place amongst the aristocracy . "
109894	109905	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" Humph ! my dear Gordon , vous irez loin . "
109906	109933	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" I hope to do so . Measuring myself against the men of my own day , I do not see many who should outstrip me . "
109934	109980	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" What sort of a fellow is your cousin Kenelm ? I met him once or twice when he was very young , and reading with Welby in London . People then said that he was very clever ; he struck me as very odd . "
109981	110017	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" I never saw him , but from all I hear , whether he be clever or whether he be odd , he is not likely to do anything in life , - a dreamer . "
110018	110023	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" Writes poetry perhaps ? "
110024	110033	109487	109488	Mr. Danvers	483	" Capable of it , I dare say . "
110202	110205	110207	110208	Lady Glenalvon	274	" But , "
110213	110252	110207	110208	Lady Glenalvon	274	" are you quite sure that my old young friend Kenelm is here ? Since you told me so , I have looked everywhere for him in vain . I should so much like to see him again . "
110253	110287	110181	110181	he	483	" I certainly caught a glimpse of him half an hour ago ; but before I could escape from a geologist who was boring me about the Silurian system , Kenelm had vanished . "
110288	110295	110207	110208	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Perhaps it was his ghost ! "
110296	110343	110181	110181	he	483	" Well , we certainly live in the most credulous and superstitious age upon record ; and so many people tell me that they converse with the dead under the table that it seems impertinent in me to say that I do n't believe in ghosts . "
110344	110357	110359	110360	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Tell me some of those incomprehensible stories about table - rapping , "
110362	110375	110359	110360	Lady Glenalvon	274	" There is a charming , snug recess here behind the screen . "
110530	110537	110539	110540	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Do you not remember me ? "
110560	110594	110547	110547	Mivers	196	" My dear Kenelm , how are you ? When did you come to London ? Why have you not called on me ; and what on earth are you hiding yourself for ? "
110645	110649	110650	110650	he	261	" Remember you ! "
110665	110786	110650	110650	he	261	" I am not so far advanced towards the noon of life as to forget the sunshine that brightened its morning . My dear Mivers , your questions are easily answered . I arrived in England two weeks ago , stayed at Exmundham till this morning , to - day dined with Lord Thetford , whose acquaintance I made abroad , and was persuaded by him to come here and be introduced to his father and mother , the Beaumanoirs . After I had undergone that ceremony , the sight of so many strange faces frightened me into shyness . Entering this room at a moment when it was quite deserted , I resolved to turn hermit behind the screen . "
110787	110804	110660	110660	his	261	" Why , you must have seen your cousin Gordon as you came into the room . "
110805	110873	110650	110650	he	261	" But you forget I do n't know him by sight . However , there was no one in the room when I entered ; a little later some others came in , for I heard a faint buzz , like that of persons talking in a whisper . However , I was no eavesdropper , as a person behind a screen is on the dramatic stage . "
110907	110954	111018	111019	Lady Glenalvon	274	" You ought to know young Gordon ; he is a very clever fellow , and has an ambition to enter Parliament . I hope no old family quarrel between his bear of a father and dear Sir Peter will make you object to meet him . "
110955	110984	111018	111019	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Sir Peter is the most forgiving of men , but he would scarcely forgive me if I declined to meet a cousin who had never offended him . "
110985	111011	111018	111019	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Well said . Come and meet Gordon at breakfast to - morrow , - ten o'clock . I am still in the old rooms . "
111040	111068	111037	111037	she	274	" My dear Mr. Mivers , you will have many opportunities of talking with Kenelm ; do not grudge me five minutes ' talk with him now . "
111069	111091	111022	111022	herself	274	" I leave your ladyship alone in your hermitage . How all the men in this assembly will envy the hermit ! "
111095	111108	111110	111111	Lady Glenalvon	274	" I AM glad to see you once more in the world , "
111113	111146	111110	111111	Lady Glenalvon	274	" and I trust that you are now prepared to take that part in it which ought to be no mean one if you do justice to your talents and your nature . "
111150	111187	111147	111147	KENELM	261	" When you go to the theatre , and see one of the pieces which appear now to be the fashion , which would you rather be , - an actor or a looker - on ? "
111192	111203	111188	111189	LADY GLENALVON	274	" My dear young friend , your question saddens me . "
111209	111273	111188	111189	LADY GLENALVON	274	" But though I used a stage metaphor when I expressed my hope that you would take no mean part in the world , the world is not really a theatre . Life admits of no lookers - on . Speak to me frankly , as you used to do . Your face retains its old melancholy expression . Are you not happy ? "
111277	111337	111274	111274	KENELM	261	" Happy , as mortals go , I ought to be . I do not think I am unhappy . If my temper be melancholic , melancholy has a happiness of its own . Milton shows that there are as many charms in life to be found on the Penseroso side of it as there are on the Allegro . "
111342	111438	111338	111339	LADY GLENALVON	274	" Kenelm , you saved the life of my poor son , and when , later , he was taken from me , I felt as if he had commended you to my care . When at the age of sixteen , with a boy 's years and a man 's heart , you came to London , did I not try to be to you almost as a mother ? and did you not often tell me that you could confide to me the secrets of your heart more readily than to any other ? "
111439	111445	111447	111447	Kenelm	261	" You were to me , "
111452	111781	111447	111447	Kenelm	261	" that most precious and sustaining good genius which a youth can find at the threshold of life , - a woman gently wise , kindly sympathizing , shaming him by the spectacle of her own purity from all grosser errors , elevating him from mean tastes and objects by the exquisite , ineffable loftiness of soul which is only found in the noblest order of womanhood . Come , I will open my heart to you still . I fear it is more wayward than ever . It still feels estranged from the companionship and pursuits natural to my age and station . However , I have been seeking to brace and harden my nature , for the practical ends of life , by travel and adventure , chiefly among rougher varieties of mankind than we meet in drawing - rooms . Now , in compliance with the duty I owe to my dear father 's wishes , I come back to these circles , which under your auspices I entered in boyhood , and which even then seemed to me so inane and artificial . Take a part in the world of these circles ; such is your wish . My answer is brief . I have been doing my best to acquire a motive power , and have not succeeded . I see nothing that I care to strive for , nothing that I care to gain . The very times in which we live are to me , as to Hamlet , out of joint ; and I am not born like Hamlet to set them right . Ah ! if I could look on society through the spectacles with which the poor hidalgo in ' Gil Blas ' looked on his meagre board , - spectacles by which cherries appear the size of peaches , and tomtits as large as turkeys ! The imagination which is necessary to ambition is a great magnifier . "
111782	111813	111338	111339	LADY GLENALVON	274	" I have known more than one man , now very eminent , very active , who at your age felt the same estrangement from the practical pursuits of others . "
111814	111824	111447	111447	Kenelm	261	" And what reconciled those men to such pursuits ? "
111825	111852	111338	111339	LADY GLENALVON	274	" That diminished sense of individual personality , that unconscious fusion of one 's own being into other existences , which belong to home and marriage . "
111853	111867	111447	111447	Kenelm	261	" I do n't object to home , but I do to marriage . "
111868	111884	111338	111339	LADY GLENALVON	274	" Depend on it there is no home for man where there is no woman . "
111885	111897	111447	111447	Kenelm	261	" Prettily said . In that case I resign the home . "
111898	111944	111338	111339	LADY GLENALVON	274	" Do you mean seriously to tell me that you never see the woman you could love enough to make her your wife , and never enter any home that you do not quit with a touch of envy at the happiness of married life ? "
111945	111964	111447	111447	Kenelm	261	" Seriously , I never see such a woman ; seriously , I never enter such a home . "
111965	112054	111338	111339	LADY GLENALVON	274	" Patience , then ; your time will come , and I hope it is at hand . Listen to me . It was only yesterday that I felt an indescribable longing to see you again , - to know your address that I might write to you ; for yesterday , when a certain young lady left my house after a week 's visit , I said this girl would make a perfect wife , and , above all , the exact wife to suit Kenelm Chillingly . "
112055	112072	111447	111447	Kenelm	261	" Kenelm Chillingly is very glad to hear that this young lady has left your house . "
112073	112117	111338	111339	LADY GLENALVON	274	" But she has not left London : she is here to - night . She only stayed with me till her father came to town , and the house he had taken for the season was vacant ; those events happened yesterday . "
112118	112134	111447	111447	Kenelm	261	" Fortunate events for me : they permit me to call on you without danger . "
112135	112163	111338	111339	LADY GLENALVON	274	" Have you no curiosity to know , at least , who and what is the young lady who appears to me so well suited to you ? "
112164	112175	111447	111447	Kenelm	261	" No curiosity , but a vague sensation of alarm . "
112176	112234	111338	111339	LADY GLENALVON	274	" Well , I can not talk pleasantly with you while you are in this irritating mood , and it is time to quit the hermitage . Come , there are many persons here , with some of whom you should renew old acquaintance , and to some of whom I should like to make you known . "
112235	112258	111447	111447	Kenelm	261	" I am prepared to follow Lady Glenalvon wherever she deigns to lead me , - except to the altar with another . "
112432	112453	112425	112426	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Come this way : there is one person I must reintroduce you to ; thank me for it hereafter . "
112537	112548	112532	112532	Kenelm	261	" Have you been long in town , Miss Travers ? "
112549	112566	112532	112532	Kenelm	261	" A little more than a week , but we only settled into our house yesterday . "
112567	112580	112581	112581	He	261	" Ah , indeed ! were you then the young lady who - "
112596	112604	112606	112606	Cecilia	364	" The young lady who - what ? "
112611	112620	112581	112581	He	261	" Who has been staying with Lady Glenalvon ? "
112621	112629	112581	112581	He	261	" Yes ; did she tell you ? "
112630	112653	112581	112581	He	261	" She did not mention your name , but praised that young lady so justly that I ought to have guessed it . "
112727	112751	112719	112719	Kenelm	261	" So that is the young lady in whom I was to see my fate : you knew that we had met before ? "
112752	112784	112722	112723	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Yes , she told me when and where . Besides , it is not two years since you wrote to me from her father 's house . Do you forget ? "
112785	112788	112790	112790	Kenelm	261	" Ah , "
112801	112851	112795	112795	he	261	" no man with his eyes open rushes on his fate : when he does so his sight is gone . Love is blind . They say the blind are very happy , yet I never met a blind man who would not recover his sight if he could . "
113040	113044	113090	113091	No man	5941	" The Londoner , "
113219	113222	113224	113224	he	196	" I , "
113231	113234	113224	113224	he	196	" We . "
113238	113240	113235	113235	He	196	" I "
113295	113298	113289	113290	Mr. Mivers	196	" We , "
113303	113307	113308	113308	His	196	" The Londoner . "
113333	113335	113328	113328	Painters	491	" We "
113346	113348	113328	113328	Painters	491	" I "
113474	113477	113436	113437	Mr. Mivers	196	" The Londoner "
113495	113498	113459	113496	a mild - looking man , who was one of the most merciless contributors to " The Londoner " and no unimportant councillor in the oligarchy of the clique that went by the name of the " Intellectuals	8528	" Intellectuals . "
113499	113502	113504	113504	Mivers	196	" Well , "
113508	113765	113504	113504	Mivers	196	" I ca n't even get through the book ; it is as dull as the country in November . But , as you justly say , the writer is an ' Intellectual , ' and a clique would be anything but intellectual if it did not support its members . Review the book yourself ; mind and make the dulness of it the signal proof of its merit . Say : ' To the ordinary class of readers this exquisite work may appear less brilliant than the flippant smartness of ' - any other author you like to name ; ' but to the well educated and intelligent every line is pregnant with , ' etc . By the way , when we come by and by to review the exhibition at Burlington House , there is one painter whom we must try our best to crush . I have not seen his pictures myself , but he is a new man ; and our friend , who has seen him , is terribly jealous of him , and says that if the good judges do not put him down at once , the villanous taste of the public will set him up as a prodigy . A low - lived fellow too , I hear . There is the name of the man and the subject of the pictures . See to it when the time comes . Meanwhile , prepare the way for onslaught on the pictures by occasional sneers at the painter . "
113797	113818	113794	113794	he	196	" I fear we must suspend our business till to - morrow ; I expect two young cousins to breakfast . "
114018	114022	114024	114024	Mivers	196	" Good morning , "
114026	114090	114024	114024	Mivers	196	" I was much pleased to see you talking so long and so familiarly with Danvers : others , of course , observed it , and it added a step to your career . It does you great good to be seen in a drawing - room talking apart with a Somebody . But may I ask if the talk itself was satisfactory ? "
114091	114189	113993	113997	a well - dressed valet	3205	" Not at all : Danvers throws cold water on the notion of Saxboro ' , and does not even hint that his party will help me to any other opening . Party has few openings at its disposal nowadays for any young man . The schoolmaster being abroad has swept away the school for statesmen as he has swept away the school for actors , - an evil , and an evil of a far greater consequence to the destinies of the nation than any good likely to be got from the system that succeeded it . "
114190	114224	114024	114024	Mivers	196	" But it is of no use railing against things that ca n't be helped . If I were you , I would postpone all ambition of Parliament and read for the bar . "
114225	114260	113993	113997	a well - dressed valet	3205	" The advice is sound , but too unpalatable to be taken . I am resolved to find a seat in the House , and where there is a will there is a way . "
114261	114270	114024	114024	Mivers	196	" I am not so sure of that . "
114271	114276	113993	113997	a well - dressed valet	3205	" But I am . "
114277	114323	114024	114024	Mivers	196	" Judging by what your contemporaries at the University tell me of your speeches at the Debating Society , you were not then an ultra - Radical . But it is only an ultra - Radical who has a chance of success at Saxboro ' . "
114324	114359	113993	113997	a well - dressed valet	3205	" I am no fanatic in politics . There is much to be said on all sides : coeteris paribus , I prefer the winning side to the losing ; nothing succeeds like success . "
114360	114430	114024	114024	Mivers	196	" Ay , but in politics there is always reaction . The winning side one day may be the losing side another . The losing side represents a minority , and a minority is sure to comprise more intellect than a majority : in the long run intellect will force its way , get a majority and then lose it , because with a majority it will become stupid . "
114431	114652	113993	113997	a well - dressed valet	3205	" Cousin Mivers , does not the history of the world show you that a single individual can upset all theories as to the comparative wisdom of the few or the many ? Take the wisest few you can find , and one man of genius not a tithe so wise crushes them into powder . But then that man of genius , though he despises the many , must make use of them . That done , he rules them . Do n't you see how in free countries political destinations resolve themselves into individual impersonations ? At a general election it is one name around which electors rally . The candidate may enlarge as much as he pleases on political principles , but all his talk will not win him votes enough for success , unless he says , ' I go with Mr. A. , ' the minister , or with Mr. Z. , the chief of the opposition . It was not the Tories who beat the Whigs when Mr. Pitt dissolved Parliament . It was Mr. Pitt who beat Mr. Fox , with whom in general political principle - slave - trade , Roman Catholic emancipation , Parliamentary reform - he certainly agreed much more than he did with any man in his own cabinet . "
114653	114661	114663	114663	Mivers	267	" Take care , my young cousin , "
114670	114704	114663	114663	Mivers	267	" do n't set up for a man of genius . Genius is the worst quality a public man can have nowadays : nobody heeds it , and everybody is jealous of it . "
114705	114978	113993	113997	a well - dressed valet	3205	" Pardon me , you mistake ; my remark was purely objective , and intended as a reply to your argument . I prefer at present to go with the many because it is the winning side . If we then want a man of genius to keep it the winning side , by subjugating its partisans to his will , he will be sure to come . The few will drive him to us , for the few are always the enemies of the one man of genius . It is they who distrust , - it is they who are jealous , - not the many . You have allowed your judgment , usually so clear , to be somewhat dimmed by your experience as a critic . The critics are the few . They have infinitely more culture than the many . But when a man of real genius appears and asserts himself , the critics are seldom such fair judges of him as the many are . If he be not one of their oligarchical clique , they either abuse , or disparage , or affect to ignore him ; though a time at last comes when , having gained the many , the critics acknowledge him . But the difference between the man of action and the author is this , that the author rarely finds this acknowledgment till he is dead , and it is necessary to the man of action to enforce it while he is alive . But enough of this speculation : you ask me to meet Kenelm ; is he not coming ? "
114979	115177	114663	114663	Mivers	267	" Yes , but I did not ask him till ten o'clock . I asked you at half - past nine , because I wished to hear about Danvers and Saxboro ' , and also to prepare you somewhat for your introduction to your cousin . I must be brief as to the last , for it is only five minutes to the hour , and he is a man likely to be punctual . Kenelm is in all ways your opposite . I do n't know whether he is cleverer or less clever ; there is no scale of measurement between you : but he is wholly void of ambition , and might possibly assist yours . He can do what he likes with Sir Peter ; and considering how your poor father - a worthy man , but cantankerous - harassed and persecuted Sir Peter , because Kenelm came between the estate and you , it is probable that Sir Peter bears you a grudge , though Kenelm declares him incapable of it ; and it would be well if you could annul that grudge in the father by conciliating the goodwill of the son . "
115178	115222	113993	113997	a well - dressed valet	3205	" I should be glad so to annul it ; but what is Kenelm 's weak side ? - the turf ? the hunting - field ? women ? poetry ? One can only conciliate a man by getting on his weak side . "
115223	115255	114663	114663	Mivers	267	" Hist ! I see him from the windows . Kenelm 's weak side was , when I knew him some years ago , and I rather fancy it still is - "
115256	115272	113993	113997	a well - dressed valet	3205	" Well , make haste ! I hear his ring at your door - bell . "
115273	115285	114663	114663	Mivers	267	" A passionate longing to find ideal truth in real life . "
115286	115289	115291	115291	Gordon	193	" Ah ! "
115293	115302	115291	115291	Gordon	193	" as I thought , - a mere dreamer "
115506	115516	115518	115518	he	193	" I have long wished to know you personally , "
115546	115575	115518	115518	he	193	" I can not conceive how I missed you last night at Lady Beaumanoir 's , where Mivers tells me he met you ; but I left early . "
115825	115850	115814	115814	Gordon	193	" But he is master of the position , and must , of course , be supported through thick and thin for the present . "
115851	115858	115860	115860	Mivers	267	" Yes , for the present , "
115862	115919	115860	115860	Mivers	267	" one has no option . But you will see some clever articles in ' The Londoner ' towards the close of the session , which will damage him greatly , by praising him in the wrong place , and deepening the alarm of important followers , - an alarm now at work , though suppressed . "
115951	115978	115979	115979	KENELM	261	" Because at present a member elected so to support him would lose his seat if he did not : needs must when the devil drives . "
115982	116023	115979	115979	KENELM	261	" When the devil drives , I should have thought it better to resign one 's seat on the coach ; perhaps one might be of some use , out of it , in helping to put on the drag . "
116027	116075	116024	116024	MIVERS	267	" Cleverly said , Kenelm . But , metaphor apart , Gordon is right . A young politician must go with his party ; a veteran journalist like myself is more independent . So long as the journalist blames everybody , he will have plenty of readers . "
116157	116160	116162	116162	Mivers	267	" But , "
116164	116182	116162	116162	Mivers	267	" would you not be obliged to defend these Bills if you were member for Saxboro ' ? "
116183	116216	116126	116126	Kenelm	261	" Before I answer your question , answer me this : dangerous as the Bills are , is it not necessary that they shall pass ? Have not the public so resolved ? "
116217	116226	116162	116162	Mivers	267	" There can be no doubt of that . "
116227	116245	116126	116126	Kenelm	261	" Then the member for Saxboro ' can not be strong enough to go against the public . "
116246	116252	116254	116254	Kenelm	261	" Progress of the age ! "
116258	116272	116254	116254	Kenelm	261	" Do you think the class of gentlemen will long last in England ? "
116273	116289	116126	116126	Kenelm	261	" What do you call gentlemen ? The aristocracy by birth ? - the gentilshommes ? "
116290	116543	116254	116254	Kenelm	261	" Nay , I suppose no laws can take away a man 's ancestors , and a class of well - born men is not to be exterminated . But a mere class of well - born men - without duties , responsibilities , or sentiment of that which becomes good birth in devotion to country or individual honour - does no good to a nation . It is a misfortune which statesmen of democratic creed ought to recognize , that the class of the well - born can not be destroyed : it must remain as it remained in Rome and remains in France , after all efforts to extirpate it , as the most dangerous class of citizens when you deprive it of the attributes which made it the most serviceable . I am not speaking of that class ; I speak of that unclassified order peculiar to England , which , no doubt , forming itself originally from the ideal standard of honour and truth supposed to be maintained by the gentilshommes , or well - born , no longer requires pedigrees and acres to confer upon its members the designation of gentleman ; and when I hear a ' gentleman ' say that he has no option but to think one thing and say another , at whatever risk to his country , I feel as if in the progress of the age the class of gentleman was about to be superseded by some finer development of species . "
116566	116578	116579	116579	he	261	" My dear cousin , if I may so call you , "
116610	116720	116579	116579	he	261	" I am one of those who , from an over - dislike to sentimentality and ca nt , often make those not intimately acquainted with them think worse of their principles than they deserve . It may be quite true that a man who goes with his party dislikes the measures he feels bound to support , and says so openly when among friends and relations , yet that man is not therefore devoid of loyalty and honour ; and I trust , when you know me better , you will not think it likely I should derogate from that class of gentlemen to which we both belong . "
116721	116729	116731	116731	Kenelm	261	" Pardon me if I seemed rude , "
116733	116775	116731	116731	Kenelm	261	" ascribe it to my ignorance of the necessities of public life . It struck me that where a politician thought a thing evil , he ought not to support it as good . But I dare say I am mistaken . "
116776	116780	116782	116782	Mivers	267	" Entirely mistaken , "
116784	116873	116782	116782	Mivers	267	" and for this reason : in politics formerly there was a direct choice between good and evil . That rarely exists now . Men of high education , having to choose whether to accept or reject a measure forced upon their option by constituent bodies of very low education , are called upon to weigh evil against evil , - the evil of accepting or the evil of rejecting ; and if they resolve on the first , it is as the lesser evil of the two . "
116874	116880	116882	116882	Gordon	193	" Your definition is perfect , "
116884	116902	116882	116882	Gordon	193	" and I am contented to rest on it my excuse for what my cousin deems insincerity . "
116903	116911	116913	116913	Kenelm	261	" I suppose that is real life , "
116920	116926	116928	116928	Mivers	267	" Of course it is , "
116930	116936	116938	116938	Kenelm	261	" Every day I live , "

117616	117617	117607	117607	they	3263	" "
117620	117621	117607	117607	they	3263	" "
117625	117676	117607	117607	they	3263	" etc . But now I find a great many who have advanced to a slang beyond that of verbal expressions , - a slang of mind , a slang of sentiment , a slang in which very little seems left of the woman and nothing at all of the lady .
117798	117804	117794	117794	Adonis	498	" pick - me - up "
117997	118088	118089	118089	woman	5943	" Of these exceptions I must content myself with naming the most remarkable . Place aux dames , the first I name is Cecilia Travers . She and her father are now in town , and I meet them frequently . I can conceive no civilized era in the world which a woman like Cecilia Travers would not grace and adorn , because she is essentially the type of woman as man likes to imagine woman ; namely , on the fairest side of the womanly character . And I say "
118090	118093	118094	118094	girl	6505	" rather than "
118096	118099	118094	118094	girl	6505	" because among "
118104	118293	118089	118089	woman	5943	" Cecilia Travers can not be classed . You might call her damsel , virgin , maiden , but you could no more call her girl than you could call a well - born French demoiselle fille . She is handsome enough to please the eye of any man , however fastidious , but not that kind of beauty which dazzles all men too much to fascinate one man ; for - speaking , thank Heaven , from mere theory - I apprehend that the love for woman has in it a strong sense of property ; that one requires to individualize one 's possession as being wholly one 's own , and not a possession which all the public are invited to admire . I can readily understand how a rich man , who has what is called a show place , in which the splendid rooms and the stately gardens are open to all inspectors , so that he has no privacy in his own demesnes , runs away to a pretty cottage which he has all to himself , and of which he can say , "
118303	118303	118089	118089	woman	5943	"
118418	118427	118428	118428	Her	364	" Heaven had made her such a man . "
118656	118666	118640	118641	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Cecilia Travers would make you a perfect wife , "
118960	119166	119167	119169	The Chillingly race	857	" and the verdict would have been proved by his senseless resistance to a mob and a dictator ! Talking of ambition , I come to the other exception to the youth of the day ; I have named a demoiselle , I now name a damoiseau . Imagine a man of about five - and - twenty , and who is morally about fifty years older than a healthy man of sixty , - imagine him with the brain of age and the flower of youth ; with a heart absorbed into the brain , and giving warm blood to frigid ideas : a man who sneers at everything I call lofty , yet would do nothing that he thinks mean ; to whom vice and virtue are as indifferent as they were to the Aesthetics of Goethe ; who would never jeopardize his career as a practical reasoner by an imprudent virtue , and never sully his reputation by a degrading vice . Imagine this man with an intellect keen , strong , ready , unscrupulous , dauntless , - all cleverness and no genius . Imagine this man , and then do not be astonished when I tell you he is a Chillingly .

121481	121513	121479	121479	Kenelm	261	" I am half inclined to think that the whole school you so systematically sought to build up is a mistake , and that realism in art is a thing impossible . "
121514	121588	121589	121590	Mr. Welby	272	" I dare say you are right . I took up that school in earnest because I was in a passion with pretenders to the Idealistic school ; and whatever one takes up in earnest is generally a mistake , especially if one is in a passion . I was not in earnest and I was not in a passion when I wrote those articles to which I am indebted for my office . "
121610	121615	121617	121617	Kenelm	261	" You sadden me , "
121619	121645	121617	121617	Kenelm	261	" It is a melancholy thing to find that one 's mind was influenced in youth by a teacher who mocks at his own teachings . "

For the rest , as I have ceased to be a critic , I care little whether I was wrong or right when I played that part . I think I am right now as a placeman . Let the world go its own way , provided the world lets you live upon it . I drain my wine to the lees , and cut down hope to the brief span of life . Reject realism in art if you please , and accept realism in conduct . For the first time in my life I am comfortable : my mind , having worn out its walking - shoes , is now enjoying the luxury of slippers . Who can deny the realism of comfort ? "
121801	121808	121812	121812	himself	261	" Has a man a right , "
121820	121933	121815	121815	he	261	" to employ all the brilliancy of a rare wit , all the acquisitions of as rare a scholarship , to the scaring of the young generation out of the safe old roads which youth left to itself would take , - old roads skirted by romantic rivers and bowery trees , - directing them into new paths on long sandy flats , and then , when they are faint and footsore , to tell them that he cares not a pin whether they have worn out their shoes in right paths or wrong paths , for that he has attained the summum bonum of philosophy in the comfort of easy slippers ? "
122069	122076	122080	122080	himself	261	" I suppose this is realism , "
122082	122095	122080	122080	himself	261	" but it is not truth , and it is not comfort . "
122242	122249	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" Our host is looking ill , "
122256	122281	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" I detect symptoms of suppressed gout . You know my aphorism , ' nothing so gouty as ambition , ' especially Parliamentary ambition . "
122282	122308	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" You are not one of those friends who press on my choice of life that source of disease ; allow me to thank you . "
122309	122327	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" Your thanks are misplaced . I strongly advise you to devote yourself to a political career . "
122328	122333	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" Despite the gout ? "
122334	122381	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" Despite the gout . If you could take the world as I do , my advice might be different . But your mind is overcrowded with doubts and fantasies and crotchets , and you have no choice but to give them vent in active life . "
122382	122448	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" You had something to do in making me what I am , - an idler ; something to answer for as to my doubts , fantasies , and crotchets . It was by your recommendation that I was placed under the tuition of Mr. Welby , and at that critical age in which the bent of the twig forms the shape of the tree . "
122449	122583	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" And I pride myself on that counsel . I repeat the reasons for which I gave it : it is an incalculable advantage for a young man to start in life thoroughly initiated into the New Ideas which will more or less influence his generation . Welby was the ablest representative of these ideas . It is a wondrous good fortune when the propagandist of the New Ideas is something more than a bookish philosopher , - when he is a thorough ' man of the world , ' and is what we emphatically call ' practical . ' Yes , you owe me much that I secured to you such tuition , and saved you from twaddle and sentiment , the poetry of Wordsworth and the muscular Christianity of Cousin John . "
122584	122698	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" What you say that you saved me from might have done me more good than all you conferred on me . I suspect that when education succeeds in placing an old head upon young shoulders the combination is not healthful : it clogs the blood and slackens the pulse . However , I must not be ungrateful ; you meant kindly . Yes , I suppose Welby is practical : he has no belief , and he has got a place . But our host , I presume , is also practical ; his place is a much higher one than Welby 's , and yet he is surely not without belief ? "
122699	122811	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" He was born before the new ideas came into practical force ; but in proportion as they have done so , his beliefs have necessarily disappeared . I do n't suppose that he believes in much now , except the two propositions : firstly , that if he accept the new ideas he will have power and keep it , and if he does not accept them power is out of the question ; and , secondly , that if the new ideas are to prevail he is the best man to direct them safely , - beliefs quite enough for a minister . No wise minister should have more . "
122812	122831	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" Does he not believe that the motion he is to resist next week is a bad one ? "
122832	122878	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" A bad one of course , in its consequences , for if it succeed it will upset him ; a good one in itself I am sure he must think it , for he would bring it on himself if he were in opposition . "
122879	122906	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" I see that Pope 's definition is still true , ' Party is the madness of the many for the gain of the few . ' "
122907	123022	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" No , it is not true . Madness is a wrong word applied to the many : the many are sane enough ; they know their own objects , and they make use of the intellect of the few in order to gain their objects . In each party it is the many that control the few who nominally lead them . A man becomes Prime Minister because he seems to the many of his party the fittest person to carry out their views . If he presume to differ from these views , they put him into a moral pillory , and pelt him with their dirtiest stones and their rottenest eggs . "
123023	123046	123120	123121	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Then the maxim should be reversed , and party is rather the madness of the few for the gain of the many ?
123047	123059	122251	122251	Mivers	196	" Of the two , that is the more correct definition . "
123060	123075	123120	123121	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Let me keep my senses and decline to be one of the few . "
123175	123183	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" Do n't you think it strange , "
123187	123281	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" that we English should so mould all our habits as to make even what we call pleasure as little pleasurable as possible ? We are now in the beginning of June , the fresh outburst of summer , when every day in the country is a delight to eye and ear , and we say , ' The season for hot rooms is beginning . ' We alone of civilized races spend our summer in a capital , and cling to the country when the trees are leafless and the brooks frozen . "
123282	123302	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" Certainly that is a mistake ; but I love the country in all seasons , even in winter . "
123303	123314	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" Provided the country house is full of London people ? "
123315	123332	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" No ; that is rather a drawback . I never want companions in the country . "
123333	123405	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" True ; I should have remembered that you differ from young ladies in general , and make companions of books . They are always more conversable in the country than they are in town ; or rather , we listen there to them with less distracted attention . Ha ! do I not recognize yonder the fair whiskers of George Belvoir ? Who is the lady leaning on his arm ? "
123406	123420	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" Do n't you know ? - Lady Emily Belvoir , his wife . "
123421	123451	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" Ah ! I was told that he had married . The lady is handsome . She will become the family diamonds . Does she read Blue - books ? "
123452	123461	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" I will ask her if you wish . "
123462	123502	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" Nay , it is scarcely worth while . During my rambles abroad I saw but few English newspapers . I did , however , learn that George had won his election . Has he yet spoken in Parliament ? "
123503	123544	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" Yes ; he moved the answer to the Address this session , and was much complimented on the excellent tone and taste of his speech . He spoke again a few weeks afterwards , I fear not so successfully . "
123545	123549	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" Coughed down ? "
123550	123555	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" Something like it . "
123556	123575	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" Do him good ; he will recover the cough , and fulfil my prophecy of his success . "
123576	123605	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" Have you done with poor George for the present ? If so , allow me to ask whether you have quite forgotten Will Somers and Jessie Wiles ? "
123606	123612	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" Forgotten them ! no . "
123613	123622	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" But you have never asked after them ? "
123623	123646	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" I took it for granted that they were as happy as could be expected . Pray assure me that they are . "
123647	123664	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" I trust so now ; but they have had trouble , and have left Graveleigh . "
123665	123679	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" Trouble ! left Graveleigh ! You make me uneasy . Pray explain . "
123680	123777	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" They had not been three months married and installed in the home they owed to you , when poor Will was seized with a rheumatic fever . He was confined to his bed for many weeks ; and , when at last he could move from it , was so weak as to be still unable to do any work . During his illness Jessie had no heart and little leisure to attend to the shop . Of course I - that is , my dear father - gave them all necessary assistance ; but - "
123778	123817	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" I understand ; they were reduced to objects of charity . Brute that I am , never to have thought of the duties I owed to the couple I had brought together . But pray go on . "
123818	123847	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" You are aware that just before you left us my father received a proposal to exchange his property at Graveleigh for some lands more desirable to him ? "
123848	123858	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" I remember . He closed with that offer . "
123859	123946	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" Yes ; Captain Stavers , the new landlord of Graveleigh , seems to be a very bad man ; and though he could not turn the Somerses out of the cottage so long as they paid rent , which we took care they did pay , - yet out of a very wicked spite he set up a rival shop in one of his other cottages in the village , and it became impossible for these poor young people to get a livelihood at Graveleigh . "
123947	123965	123185	123185	Kenelm	261	" What excuse for spite against so harmless a young couple could Captain Stavers find or invent ? "
123972	123981	123966	123966	Cecilia	364	" It was a revengeful feeling against Jessie . "
123982	123988	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" Ah , I comprehend . "
123989	124025	123966	123966	Cecilia	364	" But they have now left the village , and are happily settled elsewhere . Will has recovered his health , and they are prospering much more than they could ever have done at Graveleigh . "
124026	124038	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" In that change you were their benefactress , Miss Travers ? "
124062	124077	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" No , it is not I whom they have to thank and bless . "
124078	124089	123966	123966	Cecilia	364	" Who , then , is it ? Your father ? "
124090	124122	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" No . Do not question me . I am bound not to say . They do not themselves know ; they rather believe that their gratitude is due to you . "
124123	124164	123966	123966	Cecilia	364	" To me ! Am I to be forever a sham in spite of myself ? My dear Miss Travers , it is essential to my honour that I should undeceive this credulous pair ; where can I find them ? "
124165	124187	124040	124040	Kenelm	261	" I must not say ; but I will ask permission of their concealed benefactor , and send you their address . "
124202	124214	123966	123966	Cecilia	364	" May I ask you to present me to Miss Travers ? "
124215	124219	124221	124221	Kenelm	261	" Miss Travers , "
124223	124245	124221	124221	Kenelm	261	" I entreat you to add to the list of your acquaintances a cousin of mine , - Mr. Chillingly Gordon . "
124295	124313	124247	124247	Gordon	193	" Is not that young man whom you left talking with Miss Travers your clever cousin Gordon ? "
124314	124318	124221	124221	Kenelm	261	" The same . "
124319	124346	124247	124247	Gordon	193	" She is listening to him with great attention . How his face brightens up as he talks ! He is positively handsome , thus animated . "
124347	124403	124221	124221	Kenelm	261	" Yes , I could fancy him a dangerous wooer . He has wit and liveliness and audacity ; he could be very much in love with a great fortune , and talk to the owner of it with a fervour rarely exhibited by a Chillingly . Well , it is no affair of mine . "
124404	124410	124247	124247	Gordon	193	" It ought to be . "
124416	124421	124221	124221	Kenelm	261	" ought to be ; "
124933	125139	124925	124925	he	261	" Taking that conjecture to task , he could not honestly persuade himself that he had formed any ideal of woman and wife with which the reality of Cecilia Travers was at war . On the contrary , the more he thought over the characteristics of Cecilia , the more they seemed to correspond to any ideal that had floated before him in the twilight of dreamy revery ; and yet he knew that he was not in love with her , that his heart did not respond to his reason ; and mournfully he resigned himself to the conviction that nowhere in this planet , from the normal pursuits of whose inhabitants he felt so estranged , was there waiting for him the smiling playmate , the earnest helpmate . As this conviction strengthened , so an increased weariness of the artificial life of the metropolis , and of all its objects and amusements , turned his thoughts with an intense yearning towards the Bohemian freedom and fresh excitements of his foot ramblings . He often thought with envy of the wandering minstrel , and wondered whether , if he again traversed the same range of country , he might encounter again that vagrant singer .
125721	125752	125715	125715	he	3496	" You must do it : without effort of mine the thing may last my life . It needs effort of yours that the thing may last through your own . "
126043	126048	126054	126054	he	486	" My dear fellow , "
126060	126076	126054	126054	he	486	" I quite understand that you bore yourself : you have nothing else to do . "
126077	126083	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" What can I do ? "
126084	126087	126054	126054	he	486	" Work . "
126088	126091	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" Work ! "
126092	126142	126054	126054	he	486	" Yes , you are clever enough to feel that you have a mind ; and mind is a restless inmate of body : it craves occupation of some sort , and regular occupation too ; it needs its daily constitutional exercise . Do you give your mind that ? "
126143	126164	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" I am sure I do n't know , but my mind is always busying itself about something or other . "
126165	126177	126054	126054	he	486	" In a desultory way , - with no fixed object . "
126178	126181	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" True . "
126182	126195	126054	126054	he	486	" Write a book , and then it will have its constitutional . "
126196	126257	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" Nay , my mind is always writing a book though it may not publish one , always jotting down impressions , or inventing incidents , or investigating characters ; and between you and me , I do not think that I do bore myself so much as I did formerly . Other people bore me more than they did . "
126258	126287	126054	126054	he	486	" Because you will not create an object in common with other people : come into Parliament , side with a party , and you have that object . "
126288	126307	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" Do you mean seriously to tell me that you are not bored in the House of Commons ? "
126308	126398	126054	126054	he	486	" With the speakers very often , yes ; but with the strife between the speakers , no . The House of Commons life has a peculiar excitement scarcely understood out of it ; but you may conceive its charm when you observe that a man who has once been in the thick of it feels forlorn and shelved if he lose his seat , and even repines when the accident of birth transfers him to the serener air of the Upper House . Try that life , Chillingly . "
126399	126439	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" I might if I were an ultra - Radical , a Republican , a Communist , a Socialist , and wished to upset everything existing , for then the strife would at least be a very earnest one . "
126440	126454	126054	126054	he	486	" But could not you be equally in earnest against those revolutionary gentlemen ? "
126455	126474	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" Are you and your leaders in earnest against them ? They do n't appear to me so . "
126482	126519	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" Well , if you doubt the principles of my side , go with the other side . For my part , I and many of our party would be glad to see the Conservatives stronger . "
126520	126831	126054	126054	he	486	" I have no doubt they would . No sensible man likes to be carried off his legs by the rush of the crowd behind him ; and a crowd is less headlong when it sees a strong force arrayed against it in front . But it seems to me that , at present , Conservatism can but be what it now is , - a party that may combine for resistance , and will not combine for inventive construction . We are living in an age in which the process of unsettlement is going blindly at work , as if impelled by a Nemesis as blind as itself . New ideas come beating into surf and surge against those which former reasoners had considered as fixed banks and breakwaters ; and the new ideas are so mutable , so fickle , that those which were considered novel ten years ago are deemed obsolete to - day , and the new ones of to - day will in their turn be obsolete to - morrow . And , in a sort of fatalism , you see statesmen yielding way to these successive mockeries of experiment , - for they are experiments against experience , - and saying to each other with a shrug of the shoulders , ' Bismillah ! it must be so ; the country will have it , even though it sends the country to the dogs . ' I do n't feel sure that the country will not go there the sooner , if you can only strengthen the Conservative element enough to set it up in office , with the certainty of knocking it down again . Alas ! I am too dispassionate a looker - on to be fit for a partisan : would I were not ! Address yourself to my cousin Gordon . "
126832	126856	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" Ay , Chillingly Gordon is a coming man , and has all the earnestness you find absent in party and in yourself . "
126857	126863	126054	126054	he	486	" You call him earnest ? "
126864	126925	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" Thoroughly , in the pursuit of one object , - the advancement of Chillingly Gordon . If he get into the House of Commons , and succeed there , I hope he will never become my leader ; for if he thought Christianity in the way of his promotion , he would bring in a bill for its abolition . "
126926	126937	126054	126054	he	486	" In that case would he still be your leader ? "
126938	127006	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" My dear Kenelm , you do n't know what is the spirit of party , and how easily it makes excuses for any act of its leader . Of course , if Gordon brought in a bill for the abolition of Christianity , it would be on the plea that the abolition was good for the Christians , and his followers would cheer that enlightened sentiment . "
127007	127010	127012	127012	Kenelm	261	" Ah , "
127018	127064	127012	127012	Kenelm	261	" I own myself the dullest of blockheads ; for instead of tempting me into the field of party politics , your talk leaves me in stolid amaze that you do not take to your heels , where honour can only be saved by flight . "
127065	127290	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" Pooh ! my dear Chillingly , we can not run away from the age in which we live : we must accept its conditions and make the best of them ; and if the House of Commons be nothing else , it is a famous debating society and a capital club . Think over it . I must leave you now . I am going to see a picture at the Exhibition which has been most truculently criticised in ' The Londoner , ' but which I am assured , on good authority , is a work of remarkable merit . I ca n't bear to see a man snarled and sneered down , no doubt by jealous rivals , who have their influence in journals , so I shall judge of the picture for myself . If it be really as good as I am told , I shall talk about it to everybody I meet ; and in matters of art I fancy my word goes for something . Study art , my dear Kenelm . No gentleman 's education is complete if he does n't know a good picture from a bad one . After the Exhibition I shall just have time for a canter round the Park before the debate of the session , which begins to - night . "
127307	127309	126475	126475	Thetford	486	" Figaro "

127643	127665	127667	127667	Kenelm	261	" I should be a greater friend to liberty than I am if it were always taken in the same way , "
127700	127731	127690	127690	he	261	" My dear Tom , you are so welcome . I am so glad to see you . Sit down , man ; sit down : make yourself at home . "
127732	127769	127690	127690	he	261	" I did not know you were back in England , sir , till within the last few days ; for you did say that when you came back I should see or hear from you , "
127782	127791	127793	127793	Kenelm	261	" I am to blame , forgive me , "
127797	127840	127793	127793	Kenelm	261	" But how did you find me out ? you did not then , I think , even know my name . That , however , it was easy enough to discover ; but who gave you my address in this lodging ? "
127841	127878	127690	127690	he	261	" Well , sir , it was Miss Travers ; and she bade me come to you . Otherwise , as you did not send for me , it was scarcely my place to call uninvited . "
127879	127957	127793	127793	Kenelm	261	" But , my dear Tom , I never dreamed that you were in London . One do n't ask a man whom one supposes to be more than a hundred miles off to pay one an afternoon call . You are still with your uncle , I presume ? and I need not ask if all thrives well with you : you look a prosperous man , every inch of you , from crown to toe . "
127958	127961	127963	127963	Tom	359	" Yes , "
127965	127996	127963	127963	Tom	359	" thank you kindly , sir , I am doing well in the way of business , and my uncle is to give me up the whole concern at Christmas . "
128025	128035	128001	128001	Kenelm	261	" And what brings you to town , Tom ? "
128036	128089	128091	128091	Tom	359	" Miss Travers wrote to me about a little business which she was good enough to manage for me , and said you wished to know about it ; and so , after turning it over in my mind for a few days , I resolved to come to town : indeed , "
128095	128105	128091	128091	Tom	359	" I did wish to see your face again . "
128106	128126	128127	128127	Tom	359	" But you talk riddles . What business of yours could Miss Travers imagine I wished to know about ? "
128207	128251	128195	128195	he	261	" I have been thinking over what passed between me and Miss Travers . I wished to have the new address of Will Somers ; she promised to write to his benefactor to ask permission to give it . You are that benefactor ? "
128252	128376	128195	128195	he	261	" Do n't say benefactor , sir . I will tell how it came about if you will let me . You see , I sold my little place at Graveleigh to the new Squire , and when Mother removed to Luscombe to be near me , she told me how poor Jessie had been annoyed by Captain Stavers , who seems to think his purchase included the young women on the property along with the standing timber ; and I was half afraid that she had given some cause for his persecution , for you know she has a blink of those soft eyes of hers that might charm a wise man out of his skin and put a fool there instead . "
128377	128391	128195	128195	he	261	" But I hope she has done with those blinks since her marriage . "
128392	128467	128195	128195	he	261	" Well , and I honestly think she has . It is certain she did not encourage Captain Stavers , for I went over to Graveleigh myself on the sly , and lodged concealed with one of the cottagers who owed me a kindness ; and one day , as I was at watch , I saw the Captain peering over the stile which divides Holmwood from the glebe , - you remember Holmwood ? "
128468	128476	128195	128195	he	261	" I ca n't say I do . "
128477	128710	128195	128195	he	261	" The footway from the village to Squire Travers 's goes through the wood , which is a few hundred yards at the back of Will Somers 's orchard . Presently the Captain drew himself suddenly back from the stile , and disappeared among the trees , and then I saw Jessie coming from the orchard with a basket over her arm , and walking quick towards the wood . Then , sir , my heart sank . I felt sure she was going to meet the Captain . However , I crept along the hedgerow , hiding myself , and got into the wood almost as soon as Jessie got there , by another way . Under the cover of the brushwood I stole on till I saw the Captain come out from the copse on the other side of the path , and plant himself just before Jessie . Then I saw at once I had wronged her . She had not expected to see him , for she hastily turned back , and began to run homeward ; but he caught her up , and seized her by the arm . I could not hear what he said , but I heard her voice quite sharp with fright and anger . And then he suddenly seized her round the waist , and she screamed , and I sprang forward - "
128711	128717	128195	128195	he	261	" And thrashed the Captain ? "
128718	128725	128727	128727	Tom	359	" No , I did not , "
128729	128920	128727	128727	Tom	359	" I had made a vow to myself that I never would be violent again if I could help it . So I took him with one hand by the cuff of the neck , and with the other by the waistband , and just pitched him on a bramble bush , - quite mildly . He soon picked himself up , for he is a dapper little chap , and became very blustering and abusive . But I kept my temper , and said civilly , ' Little gentleman , hard words break no bones ; but if ever you molest Mrs. Somers again , I will carry you into her orchard , souse you into the duck - pond there , and call all the villagers to see you scramble out of it again ; and I will do it now if you are not off . I dare say you have heard of my name : I am Tom Bowles . ' Upon that his face , which was before very red , grew very white , and muttering something I did not hear , he walked away .
128921	129051	128195	128195	he	261	" Jessie - I mean Mrs. Somers - seemed at first as much frightened at me as she had been at the Captain ; and though I offered to walk with her to Miss Travers 's , where she was going with a basket which the young lady had ordered , she refused , and went back home . I felt hurt , and returned to my uncle 's the same evening ; and it was not for months that I heard the Captain had been spiteful enough to set up an opposition shop , and that poor Will had been taken ill , and his wife was confined about the same time , and the talk was that they were in distress and might have to be sold up .
129052	129141	128727	128727	Tom	359	" When I heard all this , I thought that after all it was my rough tongue that had so angered the Captain and been the cause of his spite , and so it was my duty to make it up to poor Will and his wife . I did not know how to set about mending matters , but I thought I 'd go and talk to Miss Travers ; and if ever there was a kind heart in a girl 's breast , hers is one . "
129142	129157	128195	128195	he	261	" You are right there , I guess . What did Miss Travers say ? "
129158	129361	128727	128727	Tom	359	" Nay ; I hardly know what she did say , but she set me thinking , and it struck me that Jessie - Mrs. Somers - had better move to a distance , and out of the Captain 's reach , and that Will would do better in a less out - of - the - way place . And then , by good luck , I read in the newspaper that a stationary and a fancywork business , with a circulating library , was to be sold on moderate terms at Moleswich , the other side of London . So I took the train and went to the place , and thought the shop would just suit these young folks , and not be too much work for either ; then I went to Miss Travers , and I had a lot of money lying by me from the sale of the old forge and premises , which I did not know what to do with ; and so , to cut short a long story , I bought the business , and Will and his wife are settled at Moleswich , thriving and happy , I hope , sir . "
129389	129401	128195	128195	he	261	" And they do n't know what you did for them ? "
129402	129496	128195	128195	he	261	" To be sure not . I do n't think Will would have let him self be beholden to me . Ah ! the lad has a spirit of his own , and Jessie - Mrs. Somers - would have felt pained and humbled that I should even think of such a thing . Miss Travers managed it all . They take the money as a loan which is to be paid by instalments . They have sent Miss Travers more than one instalment already , so I know they are doing well . "
129497	129504	128195	128195	he	261	" A loan from Miss Travers ? "
129505	129587	128195	128195	he	261	" No ; Miss Travers wanted to have a share in it , but I begged her not . It made me happy to do what I did all myself ; and Miss Travers felt for me and did not press . They perhaps think it is Squire Travers though he is not a man who would like to say it , for fear it should bring applicants on him , or some other gentleman who takes an interest in them . "
129588	129610	128195	128195	he	261	" I always said you were a grand fellow , Tom . But you are grander still than I thought you . "
129611	129694	128195	128195	he	261	" If there be any good in me , I owe it to you , sir . Think what a drunken , violent brute I was when I first met you . Those walks with you , and I may say that other gentleman 's talk , and then that long kind letter I had from you , not signed in your name , and written from abroad , - all these changed me , as the child is changed at nurse . "
129695	129707	128195	128195	he	261	" You have evidently read a good deal since we parted . "
129708	129749	128195	128195	he	261	" Yes ; I belong to our young men 's library and institute ; and when of an evening I get hold of a book , especially a pleasant story - book , I do n't care for other company . "
129750	129768	128195	128195	he	261	" Have you never seen any other girl you could care for , and wish to marry ? "
129769	129774	129776	129776	Tom	359	" Ah , sir , "
129778	129885	129776	129776	Tom	359	" a man does not go so mad for a girl as I did for Jessie Wiles , and when it is all over , and he has come to his senses , put his heart into joint again as easily as if it were only a broken leg . I do n't say that I may not live to love and to marry another woman : it is my wish to do so . But I know that I shall love Jessie to my dying day ; but not sinfully , sir , - not sinfully . I would not wrong her by a thought . "
129897	129919	129894	129894	Kenelm	261	" You promised to be kind to that little girl with the flower - ball ; what has become of her ? "
129920	129994	128195	128195	he	261	" She is quite well , thank you , sir . My aunt has taken a great fancy to her , and so has my mother . She comes to them very often of an evening , and brings her work with her . A quick , intelligent little thing , and full of pretty thoughts . On Sundays , if the weather is fine , we stroll out together in the fields . "
129995	130006	129894	129894	Kenelm	261	" She has been a comfort to you , Tom . "
130007	130012	128195	128195	he	261	" Oh , yes . "
130013	130018	129894	129894	Kenelm	261	" And loves you ? "
130019	130032	128195	128195	he	261	" I am sure she does ; an affectionate , grateful child . "
130033	130052	129894	129894	Kenelm	261	" She will be a woman soon , Tom , and may love you as a woman then . "
130076	130105	128195	128195	he	261	" Miss Travers said you would like to call on Will Somers and his wife ; will you ? Moleswich is not far from London , you know . "
130106	130113	128195	128195	he	261	" Certainly , I will call . "
130114	130167	128195	128195	he	261	" I do hope you will find them happy ; and if so , perhaps you will kindly let me know ; and - and - I wonder whether Jessie 's child is like her ? It is a boy ; somehow or other I would rather it had been a girl . "
130168	130183	128195	128195	he	261	" I will write you full particulars . But why not come with me ? "
130184	130230	128195	128195	he	261	" No , I do n't think I could do that , just at present . It unsettled me sadly when I did again see her sweet face at Graveleigh , and she was still afraid of me too ! that was a sharp pang . "
130231	130246	128195	128195	he	261	" She ought to know what you have done for her , and will . "
130247	130271	128195	128195	he	261	" On no account , sir ; promise me that . I should feel mean if I humbled them , - that way . "
130272	130309	128195	128195	he	261	" I understand , though I will not as yet make you any positive promise . Meanwhile , if you are staying in town , lodge with me ; my landlady can find you a room . "
130310	130365	128195	128195	he	261	" Thank you heartily , sir ; but I go back by the evening train ; and , bless me ! how late it is now ! I must wish you good - by . I have some commissions to do for my aunt , and I must buy a new doll for Susey . "
130366	130381	128195	128195	he	261	" Susey is the name of the little girl with the flower - ball ? "
130382	130416	128195	128195	he	261	" Yes . I must run off now ; I feel quite light at heart seeing you again and finding that you receive me still so kindly , as if we were equals . "
130417	130441	128195	128195	he	261	" Ah , Tom , I wish I was your equal , - nay , half as noble as Heaven has made you ! "
130451	130458	130460	130460	Kenelm	261	" This mischievous passion of love , "
130464	130574	130460	130460	Kenelm	261	" has its good side , it seems , after all . If it was nearly making a wild beast of that brave fellow , - nay , worse than wild beast , a homicide doomed to the gibbet , - so , on the other hand , what a refined , delicate , chivalrous nature of gentleman it has developed out of the stormy elements of its first madness ! Yes , I will go and look at this new - married couple . I dare say they are already snarling and spitting at each other like cat and dog . Moleswich is within reach of a walk . "
131154	131167	131134	131137	a handsome young lady	1205	" Do not mind me , Mrs. Somers : I can wait , "
131224	131263	131218	131219	the lady	802	" Now , Mrs. Somers , I want to see your picture - books and toys . I am giving a little children 's party this afternoon , and I want to make them as happy as possible . "
131264	131289	131291	131291	Kenelm	261	" Somewhere or other , on this planet , or before my Monad was whisked away to it , I have heard that voice , "
131309	131336	131306	131306	she	358	" I am sorry to keep you waiting , sir ; but if it is the baskets you come about , I can call my husband . "
131337	131340	131342	131342	Kenelm	261	" Do , "
131344	131349	131351	131352	Mrs. Somers	371	" William , William , "
131404	131413	131415	131415	Kenelm	261	" How you have improved in your art ! "
131454	131491	131428	131428	He	422	" Jessie , Jessie , it is he ! - he whom we pray for every night . God bless you ! God bless and make you as happy as He permitted you to make me ! "
131523	131528	131509	131509	she	358	" And me too ! "
131529	131536	131541	131541	he	261	" By your leave , Will , "
131588	131606	131567	131568	the lady	802	" You have another friend here , sir , who has also some cause to thank you - "
131607	131615	131617	131617	Kenelm	261	" I thought I remembered your voice , "
131622	131640	131617	131617	Kenelm	261	" But pardon me if I can not recall your features . Where have we met before ? "
131641	131716	131728	131728	she	3579	" Give me your arm when we go out , and I will bring myself to your recollection . But no : I must not hurry you away now . I will call again in half an hour . Mrs. Somers , meanwhile put up the things I have selected . I will take them away with me when I come back from the vicarage , where I have left the pony - carriage . "
131737	131746	131617	131617	Kenelm	261	" But who is that lady , Will ? "
131747	131758	131617	131617	Kenelm	261	" A Mrs. Braefield . She is a new comer . "
131759	131768	131770	131770	Jessie	358	" She may well be that , Will , "
131774	131784	131770	131770	Jessie	358	" for she has only been married six months . "
131785	131795	131617	131617	Kenelm	261	" And what was her name before she married ? "
131796	131863	131770	131770	Jessie	358	" I am sure I do n't know , sir . It is only three months since we came here , and she has been very kind to us and an excellent customer . Everybody likes her . Mr. Braefield is a city gentleman and very rich ; and they live in the finest house in the place , and see a great deal of company . "
131864	131876	131878	131878	Kenelm	261	" Well , I am no wiser than I was before , "
131880	131889	131878	131878	Kenelm	261	" People who ask questions very seldom are . "
131890	131901	131903	131903	Jessie	358	" And how did you find us out , sir ? "
131905	131911	131912	131912	she	358	" Oh ! I guess , "
131922	131937	131912	131912	she	358	" Of course , you have seen Miss Travers , and she told you . "
131938	131981	131770	131770	Jessie	358	" You are right . I first learned your change of residence from her , and thought I would come and see you , and be introduced to the baby , - a boy , I understand ? Like you , Will ? "
131982	131992	131912	131912	she	358	" No , sir , the picture of Jessie . "
131993	132010	131770	131770	Jessie	358	" Nonsense , Will ; it is you all over , even to its little hands . "
132011	132025	131912	131912	she	358	" And your good mother , Will , how did you leave her ? "
132026	132031	132033	132033	Jessie	358	" Oh , sir ! "
132037	132073	132033	132033	Jessie	358	" do you think we could have the heart to leave Mother , - so lone and rheumatic too ? She is tending baby now , - always does while I am in the shop . "
132111	132114	132116	132116	Kenelm	261	" Will , "
132126	132146	132119	132119	his	261	" I will tell you a pretty thought of a foreign poet 's , which has been thus badly translated :
132147	132178	132181	132181	Schiller	525	" ' Blest babe , a boundless world this bed so narrow seems to thee ; Grow man , and narrower than this bed the boundless world shall be . ' "
132183	132194	132196	132196	Will	362	" I do n't think that is true , sir , "
132200	132214	132196	132196	Will	362	" for a happy home is a world wide enough for any man . "
132236	132241	132242	132242	She	358	" Will made it . "
132246	132254	132242	132242	She	358	" I mean the cradle , sir . "
132309	132317	132300	132300	her	358	" Mrs. Braefield is waiting for you . "
132318	132354	132300	132300	her	358	" Good - by , Will ; I shall come to see you again soon ; and my mother gives me a commission to buy I do n't know how many specimens of your craft . "
132382	132388	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Now , Mr. Chillingly , "
132393	132407	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" it is my turn to run away with you ; get in ! "
132408	132411	132413	132413	Kenelm	261	" Eh ! "
132423	132428	132413	132413	Kenelm	261	" Is it possible ? "
132429	132514	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Quite possible ; get in . Coachman , home ! Yes , Mr. Chillingly , you meet again that giddy creature whom you threatened to thrash ; it would have served her right . I ought to feel so ashamed to recall myself to your recollection , and yet I am not a bit ashamed . I am proud to show you that I have turned out a steady , respectable woman , and , my husband tells me , a good wife . "
132515	132527	132529	132529	Kenelm	261	" You have only been six months married , I hear , "
132533	132546	132529	132529	Kenelm	261	" I hope your husband will say the same six years hence . "
132547	132563	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" He will say the same sixty years hence , if we live as long . "
132564	132571	132529	132529	Kenelm	261	" How old is he now ? "
132572	132577	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Thirty - eight . "
132578	132617	132529	132529	Kenelm	261	" When a man wants only two years of his hundredth , he probably has learned to know his own mind ; but then , in most cases , very little mind is left to him to know . "
132618	132677	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Do n't be satirical , sir ; and do n't talk as if you were railing at marriage , when you have just left as happy a young couple as the sun ever shone upon ; and owing , - for Mrs. Somers has told me all about her marriage , - owing their happiness to you . "
132678	132708	132529	132529	Kenelm	261	" Their happiness to me ! not in the least . I helped them to marry , and in spite of marriage they helped each other to be happy . "
132709	132716	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" You are still unmarried yourself ? "
132717	132723	132529	132529	Kenelm	261	" Yes , thank Heaven ! "
132724	132730	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" And are you happy ? "
132731	132747	132529	132529	Kenelm	261	" No ; I ca n't make myself happy : myself is a discontented brute . "
132748	132759	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Then why do you say ' thank Heaven ' ? "
132760	132776	132529	132529	Kenelm	261	" Because it is a comfort to think I am not making somebody else unhappy . "
132777	132797	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Do you believe that if you loved a wife who loved you , you should make her unhappy ? "
132798	132842	132529	132529	Kenelm	261	" I am sure I do n't know ; but I have not seen a woman whom I could love as a wife . And we need not push our inquiries further . What has become of that ill - treated gray cob ? "
132843	132859	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" He was quite well , thank you , when I last heard of him . "
132860	132881	132529	132529	Kenelm	261	" And the uncle who would have inflicted me upon you , if you had not so gallantly defended yourself ? "
132882	132917	132390	132391	Mrs. Braefield	523	" He is living where he did live , and has married his housekeeper . He felt a delicate scruple against taking that step till I was married myself and out of the way . "
133101	133107	133109	133110	Mrs. Braefield	523	" And from that moment , "
133114	133136	133109	133110	Mrs. Braefield	523	" my whole heart leaped to him . And now you know all ; and here we are at the Lodge . "
133186	133190	133214	133214	she	523	" city gentlemen , "
133251	133258	133260	133260	Kenelm	261	" But where is Mr. Braefield ? "
133262	133291	133214	133214	she	523	" Oh , he has taken the rail to his office ; but he will be back long before dinner , and of course you dine with us . "
133292	133300	133214	133214	she	523	" You 're very hospitable , but - "
133301	133362	133214	133214	she	523	" No buts : I will take no excuse . Do n't fear that you shall have only mutton - chops and a rice - pudding ; and , besides , I have a children 's party coming at two o'clock , and there will be all sorts of fun . You are fond of children , I am sure ? "
133363	133384	133214	133214	she	523	" I rather think I am not . But I have never clearly ascertained my own inclinations upon that subject . "
133385	133426	133214	133214	she	523	" Well , you shall have ample opportunity to do so to - day . And oh ! I promise you the sight of the loveliest face that you can picture to yourself when you think of your future wife . "
133427	133440	133442	133442	Kenelm	261	" My future wife , I hope , is not yet born , "
133454	133478	133442	133442	Kenelm	261	" But at all events , I will stay till after two o'clock ; for two o'clock , I presume , means luncheon . "
133483	133489	133479	133480	Mrs. Braefield	523	" You retain your appetite ? "
133490	133508	133479	133480	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Most single men do , provided they do n't fall in love and become doubled up . "
133683	133689	133690	133690	she	523	" Ah , Mr. Chillingly , "
133698	133791	133690	133690	she	523	" look round , look round this happy , peaceful home ! - the life so free from a care , the husband whom I so love and honour ; all the blessings that I might have so recklessly lost forever had I not met with you , had I been punished as I deserved . How often I thought of your words , that ' you would be proud of my friendship when we met again ' ! What strength they gave me in my hours of humbled self - reproach ! "
133921	133929	133931	133932	Mrs. Braefield	523	" The fair face I promised you , "
133934	133974	133931	133932	Mrs. Braefield	523	" is not here yet . I have a little note from the young lady to say that Mrs. Cameron does not feel very well this morning , but hopes to recover sufficiently to come later in the afternoon . "
133975	133983	133931	133932	Mrs. Braefield	523	" And pray who is Mrs. Cameron ? "
133984	134017	133931	133932	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Ah ! I forgot that you are a stranger to the place . Mrs. Cameron is the aunt with whom Lily resides . Is it not a pretty name , Lily ? "
134018	134039	133931	133932	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Very ! emblematic of a spinster that does not spin , with a white head and a thin stalk . "
134040	134053	133931	133932	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Then the name belies my Lily , as you will see . "
134433	134437	134440	134440	his	261	" The poet , "
134444	134516	134440	134440	his	261	" has told us that ' distance lends enchantment to the view , ' and thus compares to the charm of distance the illusion of hope . But the poet narrows the scope of his own illustration . Distance lends enchantment to the ear as well as to the sight ; nor to these bodily senses alone . Memory no less than hope owes its charm to ' the far away . '
134517	134583	134406	134406	their	3378	" I can not imagine myself again a child when I am in the midst of young noisy children . But as their noise reaches me here , subdued and mellowed , and knowing , thank Heaven , that the urchins are not within reach of me , I could readily dream myself back into childhood , and into sympathy with the lost playfields of school .
134584	134735	134440	134440	his	261	" So surely it must be with grief : how different the terrible agony for a beloved one just gone from earth , to the soft regret for one who disappeared into Heaven years ago ! So with the art of poetry : how imperatively , when it deals with the great emotions of tragedy , it must remove the actors from us , in proportion as the emotions are to elevate , and the tragedy is to please us by the tears it draws ! Imagine our shock if a poet were to place on the stage some wise gentleman with whom we dined yesterday , and who was discovered to have killed his father and married his mother . But when Oedipus commits those unhappy mistakes nobody is shocked . Oxford in the nineteenth century is a long way off from Thebes three thousand or four thousand years ago .
134736	134739	134741	134741	Kenelm	261	" And , "
134752	135021	134741	134741	Kenelm	261	" even where the poet deals with persons and things close upon our daily sight , - if he would give them poetic charm he must resort to a sort of moral or psychological distance ; the nearer they are to us in external circumstance , the farther they must be in some internal peculiarities . Werter and Clarissa Harlowe are described as contemporaries of their artistic creation , and with the minutest details of apparent realism ; yet they are at once removed from our daily lives by their idiosyncrasies and their fates . We know that while Werter and Clarissa are so near to us in much that we sympathize with them as friends and kinsfolk , they are yet as much remote from us in the poetic and idealized side of their natures as if they belonged to the age of Homer ; and this it is that invests with charm the very pain which their fate inflicts on us . Thus , I suppose , it must be in love . If the love we feel is to have the glamour of poetry , it must be love for some one morally at a distance from our ordinary habitual selves ; in short , differing from us in attributes which , however near we draw to the possessor , we can never approach , never blend , in attributes of our own ; so that there is something in the loved one that always remains an ideal , - a mystery , - ' a sun - bright summit mingling with the sky ' ! "
135288	135293	135295	135295	Kenelm	261	" Is it you ? "
135300	135328	135295	135295	Kenelm	261	" you who pelted me so cruelly ? Ungrateful creature ! Did I not give you the best strawberries in the dish and all my own cream ? "
135329	135348	135350	135352	the young lady	6894	" But why did you run away and hide yourself when you ought to be dancing with me ? "
135372	135427	135295	135295	Kenelm	261	" I did not run away , and it is clear that I did not mean to hide myself , since you so easily found me out . But who was the young lady with you ? I suspect she pelted me too , for she seems to have run away to hide herself . "
135428	135480	135295	135295	Kenelm	261	" No , she did not pelt you ; she wanted to stop me , and you would have had another rosebud - oh , so much bigger ! - if she had not held back my arm . Do n't you know her , - do n't you know Lily ? "
135481	135496	135295	135295	Kenelm	261	" No ; so that is Lily ? You shall introduce me to her . "
135641	135646	135636	135637	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Lily is come ! "
135647	135657	135698	135699	Mrs. Braefield	523	" I know it : I have seen her . "
135658	135664	135636	135637	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Is not she beautiful ? "
135665	135697	135698	135699	Mrs. Braefield	523	" I must see more of her if I am to answer critically ; but before you introduce me , may I be permitted to ask who and what is Lily ? "
135720	135816	135704	135704	she	523	" She is a Miss Mordaunt , an orphan ; and , as I before told you , resides with her aunt , Mrs. Cameron , a widow . They have the prettiest cottage you ever saw on the banks of the river , or rather rivulet , about a mile from this place . Mrs. Cameron is a very good , simple - hearted woman . As to Lily , I can praise her beauty only with safe conscience , for as yet she is a mere child , - her mind quite unformed . "
135817	135835	135837	135837	Kenelm	261	" Did you ever meet any man , much less any woman , whose mind was formed ? "
135839	135855	135837	135837	Kenelm	261	" I am sure mine is not , and never will be on this earth . "

136343	136356	136376	136376	his	3673	" I am very happy to make your acquaintance , Mr. Chillingly , "
136381	136385	136395	136395	her	523	" My husband , "
136521	136533	136535	136536	Mr. Braefield	524	" You will stay and dine with us , of course , "
136538	136563	136535	136536	Mr. Braefield	524	" and , unless you want very much to be in town to - night , I hope you will take a bed here . "
136567	136577	136579	136580	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Do stay at least till to - morrow , "
136617	136627	136632	136632	he	261	" I can not resist so tempting an invitation , "
136643	136653	136655	136656	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Thank you much for so pleasant a day , "
136661	136677	136655	136656	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Lily has enjoyed herself extremely . I only regret we could not come earlier . "
136678	136685	136687	136688	Mr. Braefield	524	" If you are walking home , "
136690	136716	136687	136688	Mr. Braefield	524	" let me accompany you . I want to speak to your gardener about his heart's - ease : it is much finer than mine . "
136717	136721	136723	136723	Kenelm	261	" If so , "
136727	136749	136723	136723	Kenelm	261	" may I come too ? Of all flowers that grow , heart's - ease is the one I most prize . "
136858	136864	136866	136867	that philosopher	935	" Do you collect insects ? "
136882	136886	136888	136888	Lily	526	" Only butterflies , "
136890	136903	136888	136888	Lily	526	" they are not insects , you know ; they are souls . "
136904	136924	136866	136867	that philosopher	935	" Emblems of souls you mean , - at least , so the Greeks prettily represented them to be . "
136925	136967	136888	136888	Lily	526	" No , real souls , - the souls of infants that die in their cradles unbaptized ; and if they are taken care of , and not eaten by birds , and live a year then they pass into fairies . "
136968	137023	136866	136867	that philosopher	935	" It is a very poetical idea , Miss Mordaunt , and founded on evidence quite as rational as other assertions of the metamorphosis of one creature into another . Perhaps you can do what the philosophers can not , - tell me how you learned a new idea to be an incontestable fact ? "
137024	137030	137032	137032	Lily	526	" I do n't know , "
137039	137054	137032	137032	Lily	526	" perhaps I learned it in a book , or perhaps I dreamed it . "
137055	137096	136866	136867	that philosopher	935	" You could not make a wiser answer if you were a philosopher . But you talk of taking care of butterflies ; how do you do that ? Do you impale them on pins stuck into a glass case ? "
137097	137117	137032	137032	Lily	526	" Impale them ! How can you talk so cruelly ? You deserve to be pinched by the fairies . "
137118	137123	137125	137125	Kenelm	261	" I am afraid , "
137129	137149	137125	137125	Kenelm	261	" that my companion has no mind to be formed ; what is euphoniously called ' an innocent . ' "
137162	137213	137158	137158	Lily	526	" I will show you my collection when we get home ; they seem so happy . I am sure there are some of them who know me : they will feed from my hand . I have only had one die since I began to collect them last summer . "
137214	137231	137158	137158	Lily	526	" Then you have kept them a year : they ought to have turned into fairies . "
137232	137291	137158	137158	Lily	526	" I suppose many of them have . Of course I let out all those that had been with me twelve months : they do n't turn to fairies in the cage , you know . Now I have only those I caught this year , or last autumn ; the prettiest do n't appear till the autumn . "
137334	137356	137357	137357	she	3688	" How can people live in towns ? How can people say they are ever dull in the country ? Look , "
137364	137410	137357	137357	she	3688	" look at that tall pine - tree , with its long branch sweeping over the water ; see how , as the breeze catches it , it changes its shadow , and how the shadow changes the play of the sunlight on the brook : -
137411	137430	137319	137319	she	3688	" ' Wave your tops , ye pines ; With every plant , in sign of worship wave . '

Happy those to whom it is no foreign tongue , acquired imperfectly with care and pain , but rather a native language , learned unconsciously from the lips of the great mother .

137615	137628	137599	137599	she	526	" Talk on ; talk thus : I like to hear you . "
137812	137821	137823	137823	Lily	526	" Come and see my butterfly - cage , "
138014	138026	138028	138028	Kenelm	261	" I have heard of a philosopher who tamed a wasp , "
138030	138042	138028	138028	Kenelm	261	" but never before of a young lady who tamed butterflies . "
138043	138046	138048	138048	Lily	526	" No , "
138052	138105	138048	138048	Lily	526	" I believe I am the first who attempted it . I do n't think I should have attempted it if I had been told that others had succeeded before me . Not that I have succeeded quite . No matter ; if they do n't love me , I love them . "
138121	138136	138116	138117	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Do you know much of this part of the country , Mr. Chillingly ? "
138137	138155	138028	138028	Kenelm	261	" It is quite new to me , and more rural than many districts farther from London . "
138156	138169	138171	138172	Mr. Braefield	524	" That is the good fortune of most of our home counties , "
138174	138224	138171	138172	Mr. Braefield	524	" they escape the smoke and din of manufacturing towns , and agricultural science has not demolished their leafy hedgerows . The walks through our green lanes are as much bordered with convolvulus and honeysuckle as they were when Izaak Walton sauntered through them to angle in that stream ! "
138225	138249	138028	138028	Kenelm	261	" Does tradition say that he angled in that stream ? I thought his haunts were rather on the other side of London . "
138250	138315	138171	138172	Mr. Braefield	524	" Possibly ; I am not learned in Walton or in his art , but there is an old summer - house , on the other side of the lock yonder , on which is carved the name of Izaak Walton , but whether by his own hand or another 's who shall say ? Has Mr. Melville been here lately , Mrs. Cameron ? "
138316	138324	138028	138028	Kenelm	261	" No , not for several months . "
138325	138370	138171	138172	Mr. Braefield	524	" He has had a glorious success this year . We may hope that at last his genius is acknowledged by the world . I meant to buy his picture , but I was not in time : a Manchester man was before me . "
138371	138382	138384	138384	Kenelm	261	" Who is Mr. Melville ? any relation to you ? "
138388	138425	138427	138427	Lily	526	" Relation , - I scarcely know . Yes , I suppose so , because he is my guardian . But if he were the nearest relation on earth , I could not love him more , "
138443	138454	138456	138456	Kenelm	261	" And he is an artist , - a painter ? "
138458	138481	138456	138456	Kenelm	261	" Oh , yes ; no one paints such beautiful pictures , - no one so clever , no one so kind . "
138561	138570	138572	138572	she	526	" There are no pictures of his here , "
138574	138593	138572	138572	she	526	" there is one in my own room . I will show it you when you come again . "
138594	138598	138600	138601	Mr. Braefield	524	" And now , "
138605	138632	138600	138601	Mr. Braefield	524	" I must just have a word with your gardener , and then go home . We dine earlier here than in London , Mr. Chillingly . "
138656	138670	138648	138648	Lily	526	" What time will you come to - morrow to see the picture ? "
138692	138711	138671	138671	Kenelm	261	" I fear I can not call to - morrow . I shall be far away by sunrise . "
138761	138768	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" A pretty little place that , "
138787	138793	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" What I call quaint . "
138794	138799	138801	138801	Kenelm	261	" Yes , quaint , "
138805	138972	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" It is always the case with houses enlarged by degrees . I have heard my poor mother say that when Melville or Mrs. Cameron first bought it , it was little better than a mere labourer 's cottage , with a field attached to it . And two or three years afterwards a room or so more was built , and a bit of the field taken in for a garden ; and then by degrees the whole part now inhabited by the family was built , leaving only the old cottage as a scullery and washhouse ; and the whole field was turned into the garden , as you see . But whether it was Melville 's money or the aunt 's that did it , I do n't know . More likely the aunt 's . I do n't see what interest Melville has in the place : he does not go there often , I fancy ; it is not his home . "
138973	138997	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" Mr. Melville , it seems , is a painter , and , from what I heard you say , a successful one . "
138998	139019	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" I fancy he had little success before this year . But surely you saw his pictures at the Exhibition ? "
139020	139034	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" I am ashamed to say I have not been to the Exhibition . "
139035	139078	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" You surprise me . However , Melville had three pictures there , - all very good ; but the one I wished to buy made much more sensation than the others , and has suddenly lifted him from obscurity into fame . "
139079	139111	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" He appears to be a relation of Miss Mordaunt 's , but so distant a one that she could not even tell me what grade of cousinship he could claim . "
139112	139410	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" Nor can I. He is her guardian , I know . The relationship , if any , must , as you say , be very distant ; for Melville is of humble extraction , while any one can see that Mrs. Cameron is a thorough gentlewoman , and Lily Mordaunt is her sister 's child . I have heard my mother say that it was Melville , then a very young man , who bought the cottage , perhaps with Mrs. Cameron 's money ; saying it was for a widowed lady , whose husband had left her with very small means . And when Mrs. Cameron arrived with Lily , then a mere infant , she was in deep mourning , and a very young woman herself , - pretty too . If Melville had been a frequent visitor then , of course there would have been scandal ; but he very seldom came , and when he did , he lodged in a cottage , Cromwell Lodge , on the other side of the brook ; now and then bringing with him a fellow - lodger , - some other young artist , I suppose , for the sake of angling . So there could be no cause for scandal , and nothing can be more blameless than poor Mrs. Cameron 's life . My mother , who then resided at Braefieldville , took a great fancy to both Lily and her aunt , and when by degrees the cottage grew into a genteel sort of place , the few gentry in the neighbourhood followed my mother 's example and were very kind to Mrs. Cameron , so that she has now her place in the society about here , and is much liked . "
139411	139425	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" And Mr. Melville ? - does he still very seldom come here ? "
139426	139670	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" To say truth , he has not been at all since I settled at Braefieldville . The place was left to my mother for her life , and I was not much there during her occupation . In fact , I was then a junior partner in our firm , and conducted the branch business in New York , coming over to England for my holiday once a year or so . When my mother died , there was much to arrange before I could settle personally in England , and I did not come to settle at Braefieldville till I married . I did see Melville on one of my visits to the place some years ago ; but , between ourselves , he is not the sort of person whose intimate acquaintance one would wish to court . My mother told me he was an idle , dissipated man , and I have heard from others that he was very unsteady . Mr. - - - , the great painter , told me that he was a loose fish ; and I suppose his habits were against his getting on , till this year , when , perhaps , by a lucky accident , he has painted a picture that raises him to the top of the tree . But is not Miss Lily wondrously nice to look at ? What a pity her education has been so much neglected ! "
139671	139675	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" Has it ? "
139676	139811	138770	138771	Mr. Braefield	524	" Have not you discovered that already ? She has not had even a music - master , though my wife says she has a good ear , and can sing prettily enough . As for reading I do n't think she has read anything but fairy tales and poetry , and such silly stuff . However , she is very young yet ; and now that her guardian can sell his pictures , it is to be hoped that he will do more justice to his ward . Painters and actors are not so regular in their private lives as we plain men are , and great allowance is to be made for them ; still , every one is bound to do his duty . I am sure you agree with me ? "
139812	139815	139817	139817	Kenelm	261	" Certainly , "
139827	139952	139817	139817	Kenelm	261	" That is an admirable maxim of yours : it seems a commonplace , yet how often , when it is put into our heads , it strikes as a novelty ! A duty may be a very difficult thing , a very disagreeable thing , and , what is strange , it is often a very invisible thing . It is present , - close before us , and yet we do n't see it ; somebody shouts its name in our ears , ' Duty , ' and straight it towers before us a grim giant . Pardon me if I leave you : I ca n't stay to dine . Duty summons me elsewhere . Make my excuses to Mrs. Braefield . "
139994	140005	140006	140006	he	261	" Give me back my knap sack . Thank you , "
140016	140095	140006	140006	he	261	" Now , do me a favour . A portmanteau of mine ought to be at the station . Send for it , and keep it till I give further directions . I think of going to Oxford for a day or two . Mrs. Somers , one more word with you . Think , answer frankly , are you , as you said this morning , thoroughly happy , and yet married to the man you loved ? "
140096	140102	139976	139976	KENELM	261	" Oh , so happy ! "
140103	140121	140006	140006	he	261	" And wish for nothing beyond ? Do not wish Will to be other than he is ? "
140122	140132	139976	139976	KENELM	261	" God forbid ! You frighten me , sir . "
140133	140173	140178	140178	he	261	" Frighten you ! Be it so . Everyone who is happy should be frightened lest happiness fly away . Do your best to chain it , and you will , for you attach Duty to Happiness ; and , "
140184	140203	140178	140178	he	261	" Duty is sometimes not a rose - coloured tie , but a heavy iron - hued clog . "
140216	140219	140204	140204	He	261	" To Oxford "
140245	140256	140237	140237	he	261	" A pedlar 's pack that bows the bearer down . "
140325	140640	140319	140319	he	261	" It is long since I have wondered at nothing . I wonder now : can this be love , - really love , - unmistakably love ? Pooh ! it is impossible ; the very last person in the world to be in love with . Let us reason upon it , - you , myself , and I. To begin with , - face ! What is face ? In a few years the most beautiful face may be very plain . Take the Venus at Florence . Animate her ; see her ten years after ; a chignon , front teeth blue or artificially white , mottled complexion , double chin , - all that sort of plump prettiness goes into double chin . Face , bah ! What man of sense - what pupil of Welby , the realist - can fall in love with a face ? and even if I were simpleton enough to do so , pretty faces are as common as daisies . Cecilia Travers has more regular features ; Jessie Wiles a richer colouring . I was not in love with them , - not a bit of it . Myself , you have nothing to say there . Well , then , mind ? Talk of mind , indeed ! a creature whose favourite companionship is that of butterflies , and who tells me that butterflies are the souls of infants unbaptized .

Why dost thou address to me those inept pedantic questionings , under the light of yon moon , which has suddenly ceased to be to thy thoughts an astronomical body and has become , forever and forever , identified in thy heart 's dreams with romance and poesy and first love ? Why , instead of gazing on that uncomfortable orb , art thou not quickening thy steps towards a cozy inn and a good supper at Oxford ? Kenelm , my friend , thou art in for it .

141758	141766	141768	141768	Kenelm	261	" I can scarcely convey to you , "
141770	141823	141768	141768	Kenelm	261	" the intense admiration with which I have studied your noble work , ' Approach to the Angels . ' It produced a great effect on me in the age between boyhood and youth . But of late some doubts on the universal application of your doctrine have crept into my mind . "
141824	141829	141831	141832	Mr. Roach	541	" Ay , indeed ? "
141843	141853	141768	141768	Kenelm	261	" And I come to you for their solution . "
141868	141876	141878	141882	the heir of the Chillinglys	1096	" I am quite willing to concede , "
141884	141906	141878	141882	the heir of the Chillinglys	1096	" that a priesthood should stand apart from the distracting cares of a family , and pure from all carnal affections . "
141907	141912	141914	141915	Mr. Roach	541	" Hem , hem , "
141927	141932	141934	141934	Kenelm	261	" I go further , "
141936	142024	141934	141934	Kenelm	261	" and supposing with you that the Confessional has all the importance , whether in its monitory or its cheering effects upon repentant sinners , which is attached to it by the Roman Catholics , and that it ought to be no less cultivated by the Reformed Church , it seems to me essential that the Confessor should have no better half to whom it can be even suspected he may , in an unguarded moment , hint at the frailties of one of her female acquaintances . "
142025	142033	142035	142035	Roach	541	" I pushed that argument too far , "
142037	142080	141934	141934	Kenelm	261	" Not a bit of it . Celibacy in the Confessor stands or falls with the Confessional . Your argument there is as sound as a bell . But when it comes to the layman , I think I detect a difference . "
142091	142116	142084	142084	his	541	" No ; if celibacy be incumbent on the one , it is equally incumbent on the other . I say ' if . ' "
142117	142421	141934	141934	Kenelm	261	" Permit me to deny that assertion . Do not fear that I shall insult your understanding by the popular platitude ; namely , that if celibacy were universal , in a very few years the human race would be extinct . As you have justly observed , in answer to that fallacy , ' It is the duty of each human soul to strive towards the highest perfection of the spiritual state for itself , and leave the fate of the human race to the care of the Creator . ' If celibacy be necessary to spiritual perfection , how do we know but that it may be the purpose and decree of the All Wise that the human race , having attained to that perfection , should disappear from earth ? Universal celibacy would thus be the euthanasia of mankind . On the other hand , if the Creator decided that the human race , having culminated to this crowning but barren flower of perfection , should nevertheless continue to increase and multiply upon earth , have you not victoriously exclaimed , ' Presumptuous mortal ! how canst thou presume to limit the resources of the Almighty ? Would it not be easy for Him to continue some other mode , unexposed to trouble and sin and passion , as in the nuptials of the vegetable world , by which the generations will be renewed ? Can we suppose that the angels - the immortal companies of heaven - are not hourly increasing in number , and extending their population throughout infinity ? and yet in heaven there is no marrying nor giving in marriage . ' All this , clothed by you in words which my memory only serves me to quote imperfectly , - all this I unhesitatingly concede . "
142456	142459	142461	142461	Kenelm	261	" But , "
142463	142469	142461	142461	Kenelm	261	" my doubt is this . "
142470	142473	142475	142476	Mr. Roach	541	" Ah ! "
142478	142485	142475	142476	Mr. Roach	541	" let us hear the doubt . "
142486	142527	142461	142461	Kenelm	261	" In the first place , is celibacy essential to the highest state of spiritual perfection ; and , in the second place , if it were , are mortals , as at present constituted , capable of that culmination ? "
142528	142533	142535	142536	Mr. Roach	541	" Very well put , "
142554	142558	142560	142560	Kenelm	261	" You see , "
142562	142920	142560	142560	Kenelm	261	" we are compelled in this , as in other questions of philosophy , to resort to the inductive process , and draw our theories from the facts within our cognizance . Now looking round the world , is it the fact that old maids and old bachelors are so much more spiritually advanced than married folks ? Do they pass their time , like an Indian dervish , in serene contemplation of divine excellence and beatitude ? Are they not quite as worldly in their own way as persons who have been married as often as the Wife of Bath , and , generally speaking , more selfish , more frivolous , and more spiteful ? I am sure I do n't wish to speak uncharitably against old maids and old bachelors . I have three aunts who are old maids , and fine specimens of the genus ; but I am sure they would all three have been more agreeable companions , and quite as spiritually gifted , if they had been happily married , and were caressing their children , instead of lapdogs . So , too , I have an old bachelor cousin , Chillingly Mivers , whom you know . As clever as a man can be . But , Lord bless you ! as to being wrapped in spiritual meditation , he could not be more devoted to the things of earth if he had married as many wives as Solomon , and had as many children as Priam . Finally , have not half the mistakes in the world arisen from a separation between the spiritual and the moral nature of man ? Is it not , after all , through his dealings with his fellow - men that man makes his safest ' approach to the angels ' ? And is not the moral system a very muscular system ? Does it not require for healthful vigour plenty of continued exercise , and does it not get that exercise naturally by the relationships of family , with all the wider collateral struggles with life which the care of family necessitates ?
142921	142991	143256	143260	THE REV . DECIMUS ROACH	277	" I put these questions to you with the humblest diffidence . I expect to hear such answers as will thoroughly convince my reason , and I shall be delighted if so . For at the root of the controversy lies the passion of love . And love must be a very disquieting , troublesome emotion , and has led many heroes and sages into wonderful weaknesses and follies . "
142992	143097	142560	142560	Kenelm	261	" Gently , gently , Mr. Chillingly ; do n't exaggerate . Love , no doubt , is - ahem - a disquieting passion . Still , every emotion that changes life from a stagnant pool into the freshness and play of a running stream is disquieting to the pool . Not only love and its fellow - passions , such as ambition , but the exercise of the reasoning faculty , which is always at work in changing our ideas , is very disquieting . Love , Mr. Chillingly , has its good side as well as its bad . Pass the bottle . "
143104	143178	143098	143098	KENELM	261	" Yes , yes ; you are quite right in putting the adversary 's case strongly , before you demolish it : all good rhetoricians do that . Pardon me if I am up to that trick in argument . Assume that I know all that can be said in favour of the abnegation of common - sense , euphoniously called ' love , ' and proceed to the demolition of the case . "
143187	143245	143179	143183	THE REV . DECIMUS ROACH	277	" The demolition of the case ? humph ! The passions are ingrafted in the human system as part and parcel of it , and are not to be demolished so easily as you seem to think . Love , taken rationally and morally by a man of good education and sound principles , is - is - "
143249	143255	143246	143246	KENELM	261	" Well , is what ? "
143263	143440	143256	143260	THE REV . DECIMUS ROACH	277	" A - a - a - thing not to be despised . Like the sun , it is the great colourist of life , Mr. Chillingly . And you are so right : the moral system does require daily exercise . What can give that exercise to a solitary man , when he arrives at the practical age in which he can not sit for six hours at a stretch musing on the divine essence ; and rheumatism or other ailments forbid his adventure into the wilds of Africa as a missionary ? At that age , Nature , which will be heard , Mr. Chillingly , demands her rights . A sympathizing female companion by one 's side ; innocent little children climbing one 's knee , - lovely , bewitching picture ! Who can be Goth enough to rub it out , who fanatic enough to paint over it the image of a Saint Simeon sitting alone on a pillar ? Take another glass . You do n't drink enough , Mr. Chillingly . "
143441	143447	143449	143449	Kenelm	261	" I have drunk enough , "
143456	143523	143449	143449	Kenelm	261	" to think I see double . I imagined that before me sat the austere adversary of the insanity of love and the miseries of wedlock . Now , I fancy I listen to a puling sentimentalist uttering the platitudes which the other Decimus Roach had already refuted . Certainly either I see double , or you amuse yourself with mocking my appeal to your wisdom . "
143524	143703	143256	143260	THE REV . DECIMUS ROACH	277	" Not so , Mr. Chillingly . But the fact is , that when I wrote that book of which you speak I was young , and youth is enthusiastic and one - sided . Now , with the same disdain of the excesses to which love may hurry weak intellects , I recognize its benignant effects when taken , as I before said , rationally , - taken rationally , my young friend . At that period of life when the judgment is matured , the soothing companionship of an amiable female can not but cheer the mind , and prevent that morose hoar - frost into which solitude is chilled and made rigid by increasing years . In short , Mr. Chillingly , having convinced myself that I erred in the opinion once too rashly put forth , I owe it to Truth , I owe it to Mankind , to make my conversion known to the world . And I am about next month to enter into the matrimonial state with a young lady who - "
143704	143730	143449	143449	Kenelm	261	" Say no more , say no more , Mr. Roach . It must be a painful subject to you . Let us drop it . "
143731	143741	143743	143744	Mr. Roach	541	" It is not a painful subject at all ! "
143749	143825	143743	143744	Mr. Roach	541	" I look forward to the fulfilment of my duty with the pleasure which a well - trained mind always ought to feel in recanting a fallacious doctrine . But you do me the justice to understand that of course I do not take this step I propose - for my personal satisfaction . No , sir , it is the value of my example to others which purifies my motives and animates my soul . "
143876	143938	143856	143857	Mr. Roach	541	" Not for my personal satisfaction , - remember that . Whenever you hear my conversion discussed in the world , say that from my own lips you heard these words , - NOT FOR MY PERSONAL SATISFACTION . No ! my kind regards to Welby , - a married man himself , and a father : he will understand me . "
143998	144003	144005	144005	he	261	" There must be , "
144009	144387	144005	144005	he	261	" a mental , like an optical , illusion . In the last , we fancy we have seen a spectre . If we dare not face the apparition , - dare not attempt to touch it , - run superstitiously away from it , - what happens ? We shall believe to our dying day that it was not an illusion , that it was a spectre ; and so we may be crazed for life . But if we manfully walk up to the phantom , stretch our hands to seize it , oh ! it fades into thin air , the cheat of our eyesight is dispelled , and we shall never be ghost - ridden again . So it must be with this mental illusion of mine . I see an image strange to my experience : it seems to me , at first sight , clothed with a supernatural charm ; like an unreasoning coward , I run away from it . It continues to haunt me ; I can not shut out its apparition . It pursues me by day alike in the haunts of men , - alike in the solitudes of nature ; it visits me by night in my dreams . I begin to say this must be a real visitant from another world : it must be love ; the love of which I read in the Poets , as in the Poets I read of witchcraft and ghosts . Surely I must approach that apparition as a philosopher like Sir David Brewster would approach the black cat seated on a hearth - rug , which he tells us that some lady of his acquaintance constantly saw till she went into a world into which black cats are not held to be admitted . The more I think of it the less it appears to me possible that I can be really in love with a wild , half - educated , anomalous creature , merely because the apparition of her face haunts me . With perfect safety , therefore , I can approach the creature ; in proportion as I see more of her the illusion will vanish . I will go back to Moleswich manfully . "
144399	144425	144395	144395	himself	261	" Go ; for thou canst not help it . Thinkest thou that Daces can escape the net that has meshed a Roach ? No , -
144484	144484	144485	144486	Whereupon Kenelm	549	"
144493	144536	144489	144489	himself	261	" Pooh ! thou flippant . My alter ego , thou knowest not what thou art talking about ! It is not a question of Nature ; it is a question of the supernatural , - an illusion , - a phantom ! "
144760	144770	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Upon my word you are very comfortable here , "
144791	144814	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Naturally so : there is no one to prevent my being comfortable . I am not married ; taste that omelette . "
144815	144831	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Some men declare they never knew comfort till they were married , Cousin Miners . "
144832	145177	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Some men are reflecting bodies , and catch a pallid gleam from the comfort which a wife concentres on herself . With a fortune so modest and secure , what comforts , possessed by me now , would not a Mrs. Chillingly Mivers ravish from my hold and appropriate to herself ! Instead of these pleasant rooms , where should I be lodged ? In a dingy den looking on a backyard excluded from the sun by day and vocal with cats by night ; while Mrs. Mivers luxuriated in two drawing - rooms with southern aspect and perhaps a boudoir . My brougham would be torn from my uses and monopolized by ' the angel of my hearth , ' clouded in her crinoline and halved by her chignon . No ! if ever I marry - and I never deprive myself of the civilities and needlework which single ladies waste upon me by saying I shall not marry - it will be when women have fully established their rights ; for then men may have a chance of vindicating their own . Then if there are two drawing - rooms in the house I shall take one ; if not , we will toss up who shall have the back parlour ; if we keep a brougham , it will be exclusively mine three days in the week ; if Mrs. M. wants L200 a year for her wardrobe she must be contented with one , the other half will belong to my personal decoration ; if I am oppressed by proof - sheets and printers ' devils , half of the oppression falls to her lot , while I take my holiday on the croquet ground at Wimbledon . Yes , when the present wrongs of women are exchanged for equality with men , I will cheerfully marry ; and to do the thing generous , I will not oppose Mrs. M. 's voting in the vestry or for Parliament . I will give her my own votes with pleasure . "
145178	145211	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" I fear , my dear cousin , that you have infected Kenelm with your selfish ideas on the nuptial state . He does not seem inclined to marry , - eh ? "
145212	145219	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Not that I know of . "
145220	145229	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" What sort of girl is Cecilia Travers ? "
145230	145294	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" One of those superior girls who are not likely to tower into that terrible giantess called a ' superior woman . ' A handsome , well - educated , sensible young lady , not spoiled by being an heiress ; in fine , just the sort of girl whom you could desire to fix on for a daughter - in - law . "
145295	145308	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" And you do n't think Kenelm has a fancy for her ? "
145309	145317	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Honestly speaking , I do not . "
145318	145350	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Any counter - attraction ? There are some things in which sons do not confide in their fathers . You have never heard that Kenelm has been a little wild ? "
145351	145366	145368	145369	Cousin Mivers	267	" Wild he is , as the noble savage who ran in the woods , "
145371	145376	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" You frighten me ! "
145377	145404	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Before the noble savage ran across the squaws , and was wise enough to run away from them . Kenelm has run away now somewhere . "
145405	145458	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Yes , he does not tell me where , nor do they know at his lodgings . A heap of notes on his table and no directions where they are to be forwarded . On the whole , however , he has held his own in London society , - eh ? "
145459	145482	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Certainly ! he has been more courted than most young men , and perhaps more talked of . Oddities generally are . "
145483	145557	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" You own he has talents above the average ? Do you not think he will make a figure in the world some day , and discharge that debt to the literary stores or the political interests of his country , which alas , I and my predecessors , the other Sir Peters , failed to do ; and for which I hailed his birth , and gave him the name of Kenelm ? "
145558	145563	145565	145565	Mivers	267	" Upon my word , "
145596	145693	145591	145591	his	267	" upon my word , I ca n't guess ; if some great reverse of fortune befell him , and he had to work for his livelihood , or if some other direful calamity gave a shock to his nervous system and jolted it into a fussy , fidgety direction , I dare say he might make a splash in that current of life which bears men on to the grave . But you see he wants , as he himself very truly says , the two stimulants to definite action , - poverty and vanity . "
145694	145708	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Surely there have been great men who were neither poor nor vain ? "
145709	145756	145591	145591	his	267	" I doubt it . But vanity is a ruling motive that takes many forms and many aliases : call it ambition , call it love of fame , still its substance is the same , - the desire of applause carried into fussiness of action . "
145757	145771	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" There may be the desire for abstract truth without care for applause . "
145772	145820	145591	145591	his	267	" Certainly . A philosopher on a desert island may amuse himself by meditating on the distinction between light and heat . But if , on returning to the world , he publish the result of his meditations , vanity steps in and desires to be applauded . "
145821	145853	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Nonsense , Cousin Mivers , he may rather desire to be of use and benefit to mankind . You do n't deny that there is such a thing as philanthropy . "
145854	145951	145591	145591	his	267	" I do n't deny that there is such a thing as humbug . And whenever I meet a man who has the face to tell me that he is taking a great deal of trouble , and putting himself very much out of his way , for a philanthropical object , without the slightest idea of reward either in praise or pence , I know that I have a humbug before me , - a dangerous humbug , a swindling humbug , a fellow with his pocket full of villanous prospectuses and appeals to subscribers . "
145952	145989	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" Pooh , pooh ; leave off that affectation of cynicism : you are not a bad - hearted fellow ; you must love mankind ; you must have an interest in the welfare of posterity . "
145990	146070	145591	145591	his	267	" Love mankind ? Interest in posterity ? Bless my soul , Cousin Peter , I hope you have no prospectuses in your pockets ; no schemes for draining the Pontine Marshes out of pure love to mankind ; no propositions for doubling the income - tax , as a reserve fund for posterity , should our coal - fields fail three thousand years hence . Love of mankind ! Rubbish ! This comes of living in the country . "
146071	146091	144772	144773	Sir Peter	421	" But you do love the human race ; you do care for the generations that are to come . "
146092	146216	145591	145591	his	267	" I ! Not a bit of it . On the contrary , I rather dislike the human race , taking it altogether , and including the Australian bushmen ; and I do n't believe any man who tells me that he would grieve half as much if ten millions of human beings were swallowed up by an earthquake at a considerable distance from his own residence , say Abyssinia , as he would for a rise in his butcher 's bills . As to posterity , who would consent to have a month 's fit of the gout or tic - douloureux in order that in the fourth thousand year , A. D. , posterity should enjoy a perfect system of sewage ? "
146246	146252	146254	146254	Mivers	267	" To turn the subject , "
146272	146358	146260	146260	he	267	" I think you would do well , while in town , to call on your old friend Travers , and be introduced to Cecilia . If you think as favourably of her as I do , why not ask father and daughter to pay you a visit at Exmundham ? Girls think more about a man when they see the place which he can offer to them as a home , and Exmundham is an attractive place to girls , - picturesque and romantic . "
146359	146365	146367	146368	Sir Peter	421	" A very good idea , "
146372	146390	146367	146368	Sir Peter	421	" And I want also to make the acquaintance of Chillingly Gordon . Give me his address . "
146391	146434	146260	146260	he	267	" Here is his card on the chimney - piece , take it ; you will always find him at home till two o'clock . He is too sensible to waste the forenoon in riding out in Hyde Park with young ladies . "
146435	146456	146367	146368	Sir Peter	421	" Give me your frank opinion of that young kinsman . Kenelm tells me that he is clever and ambitious . "
146457	146545	146260	146260	he	267	" Kenelm speaks truly . He is not a man who will talk stuff about love of mankind and posterity . He is of our day , with large , keen , wide - awake eyes , that look only on such portions of mankind as can be of use to him , and do not spoil their sight by poring through cracked telescopes to catch a glimpse of posterity . Gordon is a man to be a Chancellor of the Exchequer , perhaps a Prime Minister . "
146546	146566	146568	146569	Sir Peter	421	" And old Gordon 's son is cleverer than my boy , - than the namesake of Kenelm Digby ! "
146572	146623	146260	146260	he	267	" I did not say that . I am cleverer than Chillingly Gordon , and the proof of it is that I am too clever to wish to be Prime Minister , - very disagreeable office , hard work , irregular hours for meals , much abuse and confirmed dyspepsia . "
146762	146775	146777	146777	he	193	" Never says a kindly thing And never does a harsh one . "
146947	146952	146954	146954	he	421	" Mivers and Kenelm , "
146958	147077	146954	146954	he	421	" gave me an unfavourable impression of this lad ; they represent him as worldly , self - seeking , and so forth . But Mivers takes such cynical views of character , and Kenelm is too eccentric to judge fairly of a sensible man of the world . At all events , it is not like an egotist to put himself out of his way to be so civil to an old fellow like me . A young man about town must have pleasanter modes of passing his day than inspecting hydraulic rams and reaping - machines . Clever they allow him to be . Yes , decidedly clever , and not offensively clever , - practical . "
147699	147718	147720	147720	Travers	399	" My dear Sir Peter , is it you ? I am so glad to see you again , "
147722	147825	147720	147720	Travers	399	" What an age since we met , and how condescendingly kind you were then to me ; silly fop that I was ! But bygones are bygones ; come to the present . Let me introduce to you , first , my valued friend , Mrs. Campion , whose distinguished husband you remember . Ah , what pleasant meetings we had at his house ! And next , that young lady of whom she takes motherly charge , my daughter Cecilia . Lady Glenalvon , your wife 's friend , of course needs no introduction : time stands still with her . "
147895	147983	147870	147871	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Alas , my dear Sir Peter ! time does not stand still for any of us ; but what matter , if it leaves pleasant footprints ? When I see you again , my youth comes before me , - my early friend , Caroline Brotherton , now Lady Chillingly ; our girlish walks with each other ; wreaths and ball - dresses the practical topic ; prospective husbands , the dream at a distance . Come and sit here : tell me all about Caroline . "
148551	148558	148560	148561	Lady Glenalvon	274	" What has become of Kenelm ? "
148563	148571	148573	148574	Sir Peter	421	" I wish I could tell you , "
148576	148612	148573	148574	Sir Peter	421	" He wrote me word that he was going forth on rambles into ' fresh woods and pastures new , ' perhaps for some weeks . I have not had a word from him since . "
148613	148619	148621	148622	Lady Glenalvon	274	" You make me uneasy , "
148624	148641	148621	148622	Lady Glenalvon	274	" I hope nothing can have happened to him : he can not have fallen ill . "
148652	148658	148660	148660	Travers	364	" Make your mind easy , "
148665	148688	148660	148660	Travers	364	" I am in this secret . He has challenged the champion of England , and gone into the country to train . "
148689	148693	148695	148696	Sir Peter	421	" Very likely , "
148700	148716	148695	148696	Sir Peter	421	" I should not be in the least surprised ; should you , Miss Travers ? "
148717	148739	148660	148660	Travers	364	" I think it more probable that Mr. Chillingly is doing some kindness to others which he wishes to keep concealed . "
148942	148945	148946	148946	He	421	" celebrities . "
149002	149012	148978	148982	The most eminent of them	3876	" You may be proud of your nephew Gordon ! "
149013	149029	148982	148982	them	3875	" He is not my nephew , only the son of a very distant cousin . "
149030	149060	148978	148982	The most eminent of them	3876	" Sorry for that . But he will shed lustre on kinsfolk , however distant . Clever fellow , yet popular ; rare combination , - sure to rise . "
149070	149084	149061	149062	Sir Peter	421	" Ah , if some one as eminent had spoken thus of Kenelm ! "
149230	149256	149212	149212	he	421	" Gordon , my boy , I owe you a debt , and I am now , thanks to Kenelm , able to pay it . "
149269	149501	149257	149257	Gordon	193	" I told your father , shortly after Kenelm was born , that I meant to give up my London house , and lay by L1000 a year for you , in compensation for your chance of succeeding to Exmundham should I have died childless . Well , your father did not seem to think much of that promise , and went to law with me about certain unquestionable rights of mine . How so clever a man could have made such a mistake would puzzle me , if I did not remember that he had a quarrelsome temper . Temper is a thing that often dominates cleverness , - an uncontrollable thing ; and allowances must be made for it . Not being of a quarrelsome temper myself the Chillinglys are a placid race , I did not make the allowance for your father 's differing , and for a Chillingly abnormal , constitution . The language and the tone of his letter respecting it nettled me . I did not see why , thus treated , I should pinch myself to lay by a thousand a year . Facilities for buying a property most desirable for the possessor of Exmundham presented themselves . I bought it with borrowed money , and though I gave up the house in London , I did not lay by the thousand a year . "
149502	149626	149212	149212	he	421	" My dear Sir Peter , I have always regretted that my poor father was misled - perhaps out of too paternal a care for my supposed interests - into that unhappy and fruitless litigation , after which no one could doubt that any generous intentions on your part would be finally abandoned . It has been a grateful surprise to me that I have been so kindly and cordially received into the family by Kenelm and yourself . Pray oblige me by dropping all reference to pecuniary matters : the idea of compensation to a very distant relative for the loss of expectations he had no right to form , is too absurd , for me at least , ever to entertain . "
149627	149858	149257	149257	Gordon	193	" But I am absurd enough to entertain it , though you express yourself in a very high - minded way . To come to the point , Kenelm is of age , and we have cut off the entail . The estate of course remains absolutely with Kenelm to dispose of , as it did before , and we must take it for granted that he will marry ; at all events he can not fall into your poor father 's error : but whatever Kenelm hereafter does with his property , it is nothing to you , and is not to be counted upon . Even the title dies with Kenelm if he has no son . On resettling the estate , however , sums of money have been realized which , as I stated before , enable me to discharge the debt which Kenelm heartily agrees with me is due to you . L20,000 are now lying at my bankers ' to be transferred to yours ; meanwhile , if you will call on my solicitor , Mr. Vining , Lincoln's - inn , you can see the new deed and give to him your receipt for the L20,000 , for which he holds my cheque . Stop ! stop ! stop ! I will not hear a. word : no thanks ; they are not due . "
149900	149915	149917	149917	Gordon	193	" I must thank you ; I must give some vent to my emotions , "
149919	149947	149917	149917	Gordon	193	" This sum , great in itself , is far more to me than you can imagine : it opens my career ; it assures my future . "
149948	149974	150006	150007	Sir Peter	421	" So Kenelm tells me ; he said that sum would be more use to you now than ten times the amount twenty years hence . "
149975	149991	149917	149917	Gordon	193	" So it will , - it will . And Kenelm consents to this sacrifice ? "
149992	149998	150006	150007	Sir Peter	421	" Consents ! urges it . "
150010	150062	150006	150007	Sir Peter	421	" You want to get into Parliament ; very natural ambition for a clever young fellow . I do n't presume to dictate politics to you . I hear you are what is called a Liberal ; a man may be a Liberal , I suppose , without being a Jacobin . "
150063	150081	149917	149917	Gordon	193	" I hope so , indeed . For my part I am anything but a violent man . "
150082	150234	150006	150007	Sir Peter	421	" Violent , no ! Who ever heard of a violent Chillingly ? But I was reading in the newspaper to - day a speech addressed to some popular audience , in which the orator was for dividing all the lands and all the capital belonging to other people among the working class , calmly and quietly , without any violence , and deprecating violence : but saying , perhaps very truly , that the people to be robbed might not like it , and might offer violence ; in which case woe betide them ; it was they who would be guilty of violence ; and they must take the consequences if they resisted the reasonable , propositions of himself and his friends ! That , I suppose , is among the new ideas with which Kenelm is more familiar than I am . Do you entertain those new ideas ? "
150235	150246	149917	149917	Gordon	193	" Certainly not : I despise the fools who do . "
150247	150261	150006	150007	Sir Peter	421	" And you will not abet revolutionary measures if you get into Parliament ? "
150262	150287	150290	150290	Gordon	193	" My dear Sir Peter , I fear you have heard very false reports of my opinions if you put such questions . Listen , "
150378	150451	150370	150370	Gordon	193	" May I ask you to complete the favours you have lavished on me ? I have never seen Exmundham , and the home of the race from which I sprang has a deep interest for time . Will you allow me to spend a few days with you , and under the shade of your own trees take lessons in political science from one who has evidently reflected on it profoundly ? "
150452	150469	150471	150472	Sir Peter	421	" Profoundly , no ; a little , - a little , as a mere bystander , "
150480	150524	150471	150472	Sir Peter	421	" Come , my dear boy , by all means ; you will have a hearty welcome . By the by , Travers and his handsome daughter promised to visit me in about a fortnight , why not come at the same time ? "
150536	150543	150544	150544	he	1164	" I shall be so delighted , "
150547	150571	150544	150544	he	1164	" I am but slightly acquainted with Mr. Travers , but I like him much , and Mrs. Campion is so well informed . "
150572	150581	150695	150695	Gordon	193	" And what say you to the girl ? "
150582	150613	150544	150544	he	1164	" The girl , Miss Travers . Oh , she is very well in her way . But I do n't talk with young ladies more than I can help . "
150614	150623	150695	150695	Gordon	193	" Then you are like your cousin Kenelm ? "
150624	150635	150544	150544	he	1164	" I wish I were like him in other things . "
150636	150680	150682	150682	himself	3886	" No , one such oddity in a family is quite enough . But though I would not have you change to a Kenelm , I would not change Kenelm for the most perfect model of a son that the world can exhibit . "
151132	151226	151233	151233	I	0	" by that intermediate meal . He remained at his desk writing brief notes of business , or of pleasure , while Sir Peter did justice to lamb cutlets and grilled chicken . But he looked up from his task , with raised eyebrows , when Sir Peter , after a somewhat discursive account of his visit to the Traverses , his admiration of Cecilia , and the adroitness with which , acting on his cousin 's hint , he had engaged the family to spend a few days at Exmundham , added , "
151242	151242	151236	151237	young Gordon	193	"
151243	151274	151233	151233	I	0	" To meet them ! meet Mr. and Miss Travers ! you have ? I thought you wished Kenelm to marry Cecilia . I was mistaken , you meant Gordon ! "
151275	151278	151280	151281	Sir Peter	421	" Gordon , "
151289	151320	151280	151281	Sir Peter	421	" Nonsense , you do n't suppose that Miss Travers prefers him to Kenelm , or that he has the presumption to fancy that her father would sanction his addresses ? "
151321	151422	151233	151233	I	0	" I indulge in no suppositions of the sort . I content myself with thinking that Gordon is clever , insinuating , young ; and it is a very good chance of bettering himself that you have thrown in his way . However , it is no affair of mine ; and though on the whole I like Kenelm better than Gordon , still I like Gordon very well , and I have an interest in following his career which I ca n't say I have in conjecturing what may be Kenelm 's - more likely no career at all . "
151423	151454	151280	151281	Sir Peter	421	" Mivers , you delight in provoking me ; you do say such uncomfortable things . But , in the first place , Gordon spoke rather slightingly of Miss Travers . "
151455	151466	151468	151468	Mivers	267	" Ah , indeed ; that 's a bad sign , "
151481	151546	151280	151281	Sir Peter	421	" And , besides , I feel pretty sure that the dear girl has already a regard for Kenelm which allows no room for a rival . However , I shall not forget your hint , but keep a sharp lookout ; and , if I see the young man wants to be too sweet on Cecilia , I shall cut short his visit . "
151547	151639	151680	151680	he	267	" Give yourself no trouble in the matter ; it will do no good . Marriages are made in heaven . Heaven 's will be done . If I can get away I will run down to you for a day or two . Perhaps in that case you can ask Lady Glenalvon . I like her , and she likes Kenelm . Have you finished ? I see the brougham is at the door , and we have to call at your hotel to take up your carpet - bag . "
151837	151844	151845	151845	he	261	" I wonder which is hers , "
151905	151911	151940	151943	a respectable elderly man	3916	" Good evening , sir , "
151916	151924	151940	151943	a respectable elderly man	3916	" A capital spot for trout this . "
151971	151975	151977	151977	Kenelm	261	" For trout , "
151979	151990	151977	151977	Kenelm	261	" I dare say . A strangely attractive spot indeed . "
151991	152007	152009	152011	the elderly man	3918	" Are you an angler , sir , if I may make bold to inquire ? "
152065	152073	152034	152035	his mien	3920	" Ay , I am an angler . "
152074	152174	152034	152035	his mien	3920	" Then this is the best place in the whole stream . Look , sir , there is Izaak Walton 's summer - house ; and further down you see that white , neat - looking house . Well , that is my house , sir , and I have an apartment which I let to gentleman anglers . It is generally occupied throughout the summer months . I expect every day to have a letter to engage it , but it is vacant now . A very nice apartment , sir , - sitting - room and bedroom . "
152175	152184	152186	152186	Kenelm	261	" Descende ceolo , et dic age tibia , "
152188	152191	152193	152195	the elderly man	3918	" Sir ? "
152197	152291	152034	152035	his mien	3920	" I beg you ten thousand pardons . I have had the misfortune to have been at the university , and to have learned a little Latin , which sometimes comes back very inopportunely . But , speaking in plain English , what I meant to say is this : I invoked the Muse to descend from heaven and bring with her - the original says a fife , but I meant - a fishing - rod . I should think your apartment would suit me exactly ; pray show it to me . "
152292	152298	152300	152302	the elderly man	3918	" With the greatest pleasure , "
152304	152357	152300	152302	the elderly man	3918	" The Muse need not bring a fishing - rod ! we have all sorts of tackle at your service , and a boat too , if you care for that . The stream hereabouts is so shallow and narrow that a boat is of little use till you get farther down . "
152358	152394	152034	152035	his mien	3920	" I do n't want to get farther down ; but should I want to get to the opposite bank , without wading across , would the boat take me or is there a bridge ? "
152395	152456	152300	152302	the elderly man	3918	" The boat can take you . It is a flat - bottomed punt , and there is a bridge too for foot - passengers , just opposite my house ; and between this and Moleswich , where the stream widens , there is a ferry . The stone bridge for traffic is at the farther end of the town . "
152457	152469	152034	152035	his mien	3920	" Good . Let us go at once to your house . "
152476	152481	152483	152483	Kenelm	261	" By the by , "
152489	152514	152483	152483	Kenelm	261	" do you know much of the family that inhabit the pretty cottage on the opposite side , which we have just left behind ? "
152515	152605	152034	152035	his mien	3920	" Mrs. Cameron 's . Yes , of course , a very good lady ; and Mr. Melville , the painter . I am sure I ought to know , for he has often lodged with me when he came to visit Mrs. Cameron . He recommends my apartment to his friends , and they are my best lodgers . I like painters , sir , though I do n't know much about paintings . They are pleasant gentlemen , and easily contented with my humble roof and fare . "
152606	152766	152483	152483	Kenelm	261	" You are quite right . I do n't know much about paintings myself ; but I am inclined to believe that painters , judging not from what I have seen of them , for I have not a single acquaintance among them personally , but from what I have read of their lives , are , as a general rule , not only pleasant but noble gentlemen . They form within themselves desires to beautify or exalt commonplace things , and they can only accomplish their desires by a constant study of what is beautiful and what is exalted . A man constantly so engaged ought to be a very noble gentleman , even though he may be the son of a shoeblack . And living in a higher world than we do , I can conceive that he is , as you say , very well contented with humble roof and fare in the world we inhabit . "
152767	152792	152034	152035	his mien	3920	" Exactly , sir ; I see - I see now , though you put it in a way that never struck me before . "
152793	152797	152799	152799	Kenelm	261	" And yet , "
152807	152920	152799	152799	Kenelm	261	" you seem to me a well - educated and intelligent man ; reflective on things in general , without being unmindful of your interests in particular , especially when you have lodgings to let . Do not be offended . That sort of man is not perhaps born to be a painter , but I respect him highly . The world , sir , requires the vast majority of its inhabitants to live in it , - to live by it . ' Each for himself , and God for us all . ' The greatest happiness of the greatest number is best secured by a prudent consideration for Number One . "
152957	152975	152950	152950	his	3926	" Hear , hear ! I see that , like me , you are a decided democrat . "
152976	153014	152034	152035	his mien	3920	" Democrat ! Pray , may I ask , not why you are one , - that would be a liberty , and democrats resent any liberty taken with themselves ; but why you suppose I am ? "
153015	153072	152950	152950	his	3926	" You spoke of the greatest happiness of the greatest number . That is a democratic sentiment surely ! Besides , did not you say , sir , that painters , - painters , sir , painters , even if they were the sons of shoeblacks , were the true gentlemen , - the true noblemen ? "
153073	153098	152034	152035	his mien	3920	" I did not say that exactly , to the disparagement of other gentlemen and nobles . But if I did , what then ? "
153099	153216	152950	152950	his	3926	" Sir , I agree with you . I despise rank ; I despise dukes and earls and aristocrats . ' An honest man 's the noblest work of God . ' Some poet says that . I think Shakspeare . Wonderful man , Shakspeare . A tradesman 's son , - butcher , I believe . Eh ! My uncle was a butcher , and might have been an alderman . I go along with you heartily , heartily . I am a democrat , every inch of me . Shake hands , sir , shake hands ; we are all equals . ' Each man for himself , and God for us all . ' "
153217	153226	153228	153228	Kenelm	261	" I have no objection to shake hands , "
153230	153311	153228	153228	Kenelm	261	" but do n't let me owe your condescension to false pretences . Though we are all equal before the law , except the rich man , who has little chance of justice as against a poor man when submitted to an English jury , yet I utterly deny that any two men you select can be equals . One must beat the other in something ; and , when one man beats another , democracy ceases and aristocracy begins . "
153312	153328	152950	152950	his	3926	" Aristocracy ! I do n't see that . What do you mean by aristocracy ? "
153329	153545	153228	153228	Kenelm	261	" The ascendency of the better man . In a rude State the better man is the stronger ; in a corrupt State , perhaps the more roguish ; in modern republics the jobbers get the money and the lawyers get the power . In well - ordered States alone aristocracy appears at its genuine worth : the better man in birth , because respect for ancestry secures a higher standard of honour ; the better man in wealth , because of the immense uses to enterprise , energy , and the fine arts , which rich men must be if they follow their natural inclinations ; the better man in character , the better man in ability , for reasons too obvious to define ; and these two last will beat the others in the government of the State , if the State be flourishing and free . All these four classes of better men constitute true aristocracy ; and when a better government than a true aristocracy shall be devised by the wit of man , we shall not be far off from the Millennium and the reign of saints . But here we are at the house , - yours , is it not ? I like the look of it extremely . "
153584	153591	153546	153548	The elderly man	3918	" Will it do , sir ? "
153592	153634	153546	153548	The elderly man	3918	" Perfectly . I take it from this moment . My knapsack contains all I shall need for the night . There is a portmanteau of mine at Mr. Somers 's shop , which can be sent here in the morning . "
153635	153645	153647	153649	the elderly man	3918	" But we have not settled about the terms , "
153697	153705	153647	153649	the elderly man	3918	" Terms ? true , name them . "
153706	153710	153647	153649	the elderly man	3918	" Including board ? "
153711	153735	153647	153649	the elderly man	3918	" Certainly . Chameleons live on air ; democrats on wind bags . I have a more vulgar appetite , and require mutton . "
153736	153747	153749	153751	the elderly man	3918	" Meat is very dear now - a - days , "
153753	153789	153749	153751	the elderly man	3918	" and I am afraid , for board and lodging I can not charge you less than L3 3s . , - say L3 a week . My lodgers usually pay a week in advance . "
153790	153793	153795	153795	Kenelm	261	" Agreed , "
153804	153834	153795	153795	Kenelm	261	" I have dined already : I want nothing more this evening ; let me detain you no further . Be kind enough to shut the door after you . "
153982	153999	154009	154013	the elderly man 's wife	3940	" Shall I bring lights , sir ? or do you prefer a lamp or candles ? "
154015	154023	154009	154011	the elderly man	3918	" Do you like the shutters closed ? "
154061	154070	154071	154071	he	261	" Thank you , ma'am , not yet , "
154220	154290	154189	154189	He	261	" I have hired a lodging in your neighbourhood , on the banks of the brook , for the sake of its trout - fishing . So you will allow me to call on you sometimes , and one of these days I hope you will give me the dinner I so unceremoniously rejected some days ago . I was then summoned away suddenly , much against my will . "
154291	154310	154571	154572	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Yes ; my husband said that you shot off from him with a wild exclamation about duty . "
154311	154398	154189	154189	He	261	" Quite true ; my reason , and I may say my conscience , were greatly perplexed upon a matter extremely important and altogether new to me . I went to Oxford , - the place above all others in which questions of reason and conscience are most deeply considered , and perhaps least satisfactorily solved . Relieved in my mind by my visit to a distinguished ornament of that university , I felt I might indulge in a summer holiday , and here I am . "
154399	154428	154571	154572	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Ah ! I understand . You had religious doubts , - thought perhaps of turning Roman Catholic . I hope you are not going to do so ? "
154429	154445	154189	154189	He	261	" My doubts were not necessarily of a religious nature . Pagans have entertained them . "
154446	154462	154464	154465	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Whatever they were I am pleased to see they did not prevent your return , "
154469	154499	154464	154465	Mrs. Braefield	523	" But where have you found a lodging ; why not have come to us ? My husband would have been scarcely less glad than myself to receive you . "
154500	154570	154571	154572	Mrs. Braefield	523	" You say that so sincerely , and so cordially , that to answer by a brief ' I thank you ' seems rigid and heartless . But there are times in life when one yearns to be alone , - to commune with one 's own heart , and , if possible , be still ; I am in one of those moody times . Bear with me . "
154614	154647	154571	154572	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Bear with you ; yes , indeed . I wish , Mr. Chillingly , that I were your sister , and that you would confide in me . Something troubles you . "
154648	154674	154725	154726	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Troubles me , - no . My thoughts are happy ones , and they may sometimes perplex me , but they do not trouble . "
154710	154723	154725	154726	Mrs. Braefield	523	" You have not told me where you have found a lodging , "
154731	154736	154738	154738	Kenelm	261	" Did I not ? "
154751	154852	154738	154738	Kenelm	261	" With no undistinguished host , I presume , for when I asked him this morning for the right address of this cottage , in order to direct such luggage as I have to be sent there , he gave me his card with a grand air , saying , ' I am pretty well known at Moleswich , by and beyond it . ' I have not yet looked at his card . Oh , here it is , - ' Algernon Sidney Gale Jones , Cromwell Lodge ; ' you laugh . What do you know of him ? "
154853	154876	154725	154726	Mrs. Braefield	523	" I wish my husband were here ; he would tell you more about him . Mr. Jones is quite a character . "
154877	154882	154738	154738	Kenelm	261	" So I perceive . "
154883	154990	154725	154726	Mrs. Braefield	523	" A great radical , - very talkative and troublesome at the vestry ; but our vicar , Mr. Emlyn , says there is no real harm in him , that his bark is worse than his bite , and that his republican or radical notions must be laid to the door of his godfathers ! In addition to his name of Jones , he was unhappily christened Gale ; Gale Jones being a noted radical orator at the time of his birth . And I suppose Algernon Sidney was prefixed to Gale in order to devote the new - born more emphatically to republican principles . "
154991	155147	154738	154738	Kenelm	261	" Naturally , therefore , Algernon Sidney Gale Jones baptizes his house Cromwell Lodge , seeing that Algernon Sidney held the Protectorate in especial abhorrence , and that the original Gale Jones , if an honest radical , must have done the same , considering what rough usage the advocates of Parliamentary Reform met with at the hands of his Highness . But we must be indulgent to men who have been unfortunately christened before they had any choice of the names that were to rule their fate . I myself should have been less whimsical had I not been named after a Kenelm who believed in sympathetic powders . Apart from his political doctrines , I like my landlord : he keeps his wife in excellent order . She seems frightened at the sound of her own footsteps , and glides to and fro , a pallid image of submissive womanhood in list slippers . "
155148	155173	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Great recommendations certainly , and Cromwell Lodge is very prettily situated . By the by , it is very near Mrs. Cameron 's . "
155174	155185	155187	155187	Kenelm	261	" Now I think of it , so it is , "
155221	155250	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Since you say you will dine with us , suppose we fix the day after to - morrow , and I will ask Mrs. Cameron and Lily . "
155251	155264	155195	155195	Kenelm	261	" The day after to - morrow : I shall be delighted . "
155265	155270	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" An early hour ? "
155271	155277	155195	155195	Kenelm	261	" The earlier the better . "
155278	155285	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Is six o'clock too early ? "
155286	155316	155195	155195	Kenelm	261	" Too early ! certainly not ; on the contrary . Good - day : I must now go to Mrs. Somers ; she has charge of my portmanteau . "
155321	155326	155328	155329	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Poor dear Lily ! "
155331	155341	155328	155329	Mrs. Braefield	523	" I wish she were less of a child . "
155346	155362	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Is she a child ? I do n't think she is actually a child . "
155363	155407	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Not in years ; she is between seventeen and eighteen : but my husband says that she is too childish to talk to , and always tells me to take her off his hands ; he would rather talk with Mrs. Cameron . "
155408	155411	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Indeed ! "
155412	155420	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Still I find something in her . "
155421	155424	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Indeed ! "
155425	155434	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Not exactly childish , nor quite womanish . "
155435	155439	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" What then ? "
155440	155463	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" I ca n't exactly define . But you know what Mr. Melville and Mrs. Cameron call her as a pet name ? "
155464	155467	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" No . "
155468	155483	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Fairy ! Fairies have no age ; fairy is neither child nor woman . "
155484	155500	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Fairy . She is called fairy by those who know her best ? Fairy ! "
155501	155508	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" And she believes in fairies . "
155509	155536	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Does she ? - so do I. Pardon me , I must be off . The day after to - morrow , - six o'clock . "
155537	155542	155544	155544	Elsie	340	" Wait one moment , "
155553	155570	155544	155544	Elsie	340	" Since you pass Grasmere on your way home , will you kindly leave this note ? "
155571	155582	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" I thought Grasmere was a lake in the north ? "
155583	155639	155544	155544	Elsie	340	" Yes ; but Mr. Melville chose to call the cottage by the name of the lake . I think the first picture he ever sold was a view of Wordsworth 's house there . Here is my note to ask Mrs. Cameron to meet you ; but if you object to be my messenger - "
155640	155659	155202	155204	truth - teller	3952	" Object ! my dear Mrs. Braefield . As you say , I pass close by the cottage . "
155767	155776	155781	155781	himself	261	" And so you are happy , Will ? "
155835	155900	155824	155824	he	261	" Happy , sir ! I should think so , indeed . There is not a night on which Jessie and I , and mother too , do not pray that some day or other you may be as happy . By and by the baby will learn to pray ' God bless papa , and mamma , grandmamma , and Mr. Chillingly . ' "
155901	155967	155824	155824	he	261	" There is some one else much more deserving of prayers than I , though needing them less . You will know some day : pass it by now . To return to the point : you are happy ; if I asked why , would you not say , ' Because I have married the girl I love , and have never repented ' ? "
155968	155994	155824	155824	he	261	" Well , sir , that is about it ; though , begging your pardon , I think it could be put more prettily somehow . "
155995	156025	155824	155824	he	261	" You are right there . But perhaps love and happiness never yet found any words that could fitly express them . Good - bye , for the present . "
156059	156073	155824	155824	he	261	" The main element of happiness is bodily or animal health and strength , "
156388	156425	156463	156464	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Ah ! Fairy , Fairy , that silly book , when you ought to be at your French verbs . What will your guardian say when he comes and finds you have so wasted time ? "
156426	156446	156448	156448	Lily	526	" He will say that fairies never waste their time ; and he will scold you for saying so . "
156473	156501	156503	156503	she	526	" There ! is that wasting time ? I love you so , aunty . In a day like this I think I love everybody and everything ! "
156719	156738	156746	156746	he	261	" Pardon my intrusion , Mrs. Cameron . I am the bearer of this note from Mrs. Braefield . "
156752	156764	156746	156746	he	261	" You promised to show me the picture , Miss Mordaunt . "
156765	156774	156746	156746	he	261	" But that was a long time ago . "
156775	156788	156746	156746	he	261	" Too long to expect a lady 's promise to be kept ? "
156802	156834	156746	156746	he	261	" I will show you the picture . I do n't think I ever broke a promise yet , but I shall be more careful how I make one in future . "
156835	156839	156746	156746	he	261	" Why so ? "
156840	156857	156858	156858	Lily	526	" Because you did not value mine when I made it , and that hurt me . "
156872	156877	156861	156861	her	526	" I was offended . "
156878	156885	156887	156888	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Mrs. Braefield is very kind , "
156911	156911	156903	156903	You	526	"
156912	156969	156891	156891	she	206	" All grown - up people , I suppose ? No , thank you , dear aunt . You go alone , I would rather stay at home . May I have little Clemmy to play with ? She will bring Juba , and Blanche is very partial to Juba , though she does scratch him . "
156970	156990	156903	156903	You	526	" Very well , my dear , you shall have your playmate , and I will go by myself . "
156995	157039	156991	156991	Kenelm	261	" You will not go , Miss Mordaunt ; Mrs. Braefield will be so disappointed . And if you do n't go , whom shall I have to talk to ? I do n't like grown - up people better than you do . "
157040	157045	156891	156891	she	206	" You are going ? "
157046	157049	156991	156991	Kenelm	261	" Certainly . "
157050	157073	156891	156891	she	206	" And if I go you will talk to me ? I am afraid of Mr. Braefield . He is so wise . "
157074	157091	156991	156991	Kenelm	261	" I will save you from him , and will not utter a grain of wisdom . "
157092	157099	156891	156891	she	206	" Aunty , I will go . "
157451	157456	157457	157457	he	261	" I was right , "
157462	157467	157457	157457	he	261	" I divined it . "
157490	157498	157470	157470	he	261	" You divined it . Divined what ? "
157499	157511	157470	157470	he	261	" Nothing , nothing ; I was but talking to myself . "
157512	157524	157526	157526	Fairy	571	" Tell me what you divined : I insist upon it ! "
157536	157607	157470	157470	he	261	" Do you ? Then I obey . I have taken a lodging for a short time on the other side of the brook , - Cromwell Lodge , - and seeing your house as I passed , I divined that your room was in this part of it . How soft here is the view of the water ! Ah ! yonder is Izaak Walton 's summer - house . "
157608	157638	157470	157470	he	261	" Do n't talk about Izaak Walton , or I shall quarrel with you , as I did with Lion when he wanted me to like that cruel book . "
157639	157644	157470	157470	he	261	" Who is Lion ? "
157645	157686	157470	157470	he	261	" Lion , - of course , my guardian . I called him Lion when I was a little child . It was on seeing in one of his books a print of a lion playing with a little child . "
157687	157696	157698	157698	Kenelm	261	" Ah ! I know the design well , "
157705	157744	157698	157698	Kenelm	261	" It is from an antique Greek gem . It is not the lion that plays with the child , it is the child that masters the lion , and the Greeks called the child ' Love . ' "
157771	157808	157757	157757	she	526	" I see now why I mastered Blanche , who will not make friends with any one else : I love Blanche . Ah , that reminds me , - come and look at the picture . "
157844	157853	157809	157809	She	526	" Look there ! is it not beautiful ? "
157935	157939	157941	157941	Lily	526	" You understand , "
157964	158073	157955	157955	she	526	" it is Blanche 's first sight of a bird . Look well at her face ; do n't you see a sudden surprise , - half joy , half fear ? She ceases to play with the reel . Her intellect - or , as Mr. Braefield would say , ' her instinct ' - is for the first time aroused . From that moment Blanche was no longer a mere kitten . And it required , oh , the most careful education , to teach her not to kill the poor little birds . She never does now , but I had such trouble with her . "
158074	158117	157955	157955	she	526	" I can not say honestly that I do see all that you do in the picture ; but it seems to me very simply painted , and was , no doubt , a striking likeness of Blanche at that early age . "
158118	158193	157955	157955	she	526	" So it was . Lion drew the first sketch from life with his pencil ; and when he saw how pleased I was with it - he was so good - he put it on canvas , and let me sit by him while he painted it . Then he took it away , and brought it back finished and framed as you see , last May , a present for my birthday . "
158194	158205	157955	157955	she	526	" You were born in May - with the flowers . "
158206	158221	157955	157955	she	526	" The best of all the flowers are born in May , - violets . "
158222	158249	157955	157955	she	526	" But they are born in the shade , and cling to it . Surely , as a child of May , you love the sun ! "
158250	158309	157955	157955	she	526	" I love the sun ; it is never too bright nor too warm for me . But I do n't think that , though born in May , I was born in sunlight . I feel more like my own native self when I creep into the shade and sit down alone . I can weep then . "
158378	158488	158372	158372	Kenelm	261	" You say your own native self . Do you , then , feel , as I often do , that there is a second , possibly a native , self , deep hid beneath the self , - not merely what we show to the world in common that may be merely a mask , but the self that we ordinarily accept even when in solitude as our own , an inner innermost self , oh so different and so rarely coming forth from its hiding - place , asserting its right of sovereignty , and putting out the other self as the sun puts out a star ? "
158591	158681	158564	158564	her	4010	" How true ! You have felt that too ? Where is that innermost self , so deep down , - so deep ; yet when it does come forth , so much higher , - higher , - immeasurably higher than one 's everyday self ? It does not tame the butterflies ; it longs to get to the stars . And then , - and then , - ah , how soon it fades back again ! You have felt that . Does it not puzzle you ? "
158682	158686	158564	158564	her	4010	" Very much . "
158687	158700	158564	158564	her	4010	" Are there no wise books about it that help to explain ? "
158701	158760	158564	158564	her	4010	" No wise books in my very limited reading even hint at the puzzle . I fancy that it is one of those insoluble questions that rest between the infant and his Maker . Mind and soul are not the same things , and what you and I call ' wise men ' are always confounding the two - "
158817	158855	158801	158802	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Very much . I am no great judge of the art . But it pleased me at once , and now that Miss Mordaunt has interpreted the intention of the painter I admire it yet more . "
158856	158946	158801	158802	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Lily chooses to interpret his intention in her own way , and insists that Blanche 's expression of countenance conveys an idea of her capacity to restrain her destructive instinct , and be taught to believe that it is wrong to kill birds for mere sport . For food she need not kill them , seeing that Lily takes care that she has plenty to eat . But I do n't think that Mr. Melville had the slightest suspicion that he had indicated that capacity in his picture . "
158947	158961	158963	158963	Lily	526	" He must have done so , whether he suspected it or not , "
158967	158975	158963	158963	Lily	526	" otherwise he would not be truthful . "
158976	158981	158983	158983	Kenelm	261	" Why not truthful ? "
158985	159033	158801	158802	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Do n't you see ? If you were called upon to describe truthfully the character of any little child , would you only speak of such naughty impulses as all children have in common , and not even hint at the capacity to be made better ? "
159034	159038	159040	159040	Kenelm	261	" Admirably put ! "
159042	159090	159040	159040	Kenelm	261	" There is no doubt that a much fiercer animal than a cat - a tiger , for instance , or a conquering hero - may be taught to live on the kindest possible terms with the creatures on which it was its natural instinct to prey . "
159091	159151	159153	159153	Lily	526	" Yes , yes ; hear that , aunty ! You remember the Happy Family that we saw eight years ago , at Moleswich fair , with a cat not half so nice as Blanche allowing a mouse to bite her ear ? Well , then , would Lion not have been shamefully false to Blanche if he had not "
159177	159186	159153	159153	Lily	526	" given a glimpse of her innermost self ? "
159187	159191	159193	159194	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Innermost self ! "
159210	159222	159201	159201	Lily	526	" Is not one 's innermost self one 's best self ? "
159301	159324	159289	159289	Goethe	210	" There is something in every man 's heart , that , if you knew it , would make you hate him . "
159647	159664	159668	159668	Lily	526	" Will you not try the stream to - day , sir ? Take my rod . "
159675	159680	159668	159668	Lily	526	" a cruel one , "
159734	159737	159738	159738	he	261	" Ah ! "
159743	159998	159738	159738	he	261	" if , as I hold , a man but tolerably good does good unconsciously merely by the act of living , - if he can no more traverse his way from the cradle to the grave , without letting fall , as he passes , the germs of strength , fertility , and beauty , than can a reckless wind or a vagrant bird , which , where it passes , leaves behind it the oak , the corn - sheaf , or the flower , - ah , if that be so , how tenfold the good must be , if the man find the gentler and purer duplicate of his own being in that mysterious , undefinable union which Shakspeares and day - labourers equally agree to call love ; which Newton never recognizes , and which Descartes his only rival in the realms of thought at once severe and imaginative reduces into links of early association , explaining that he loved women who squinted , because , when he was a boy , a girl with that infirmity squinted at him from the other side of his father 's garden - wall ! Ah ! be this union between man and woman what it may ; if it be really love , really the bond which embraces the innermost and bettermost self of both , - how daily , hourly , momently , should we bless God for having made it so easy to be happy and to be good ! "
160053	160060	160061	160061	he	3719	" You see , my dear , "
160066	160110	160061	160061	he	3719	" Mrs. Cameron is a very good , simple sort of woman , but not particularly amusing ; and Lily , though a pretty girl , is so exceedingly childish . We owe much , my sweet Elsie , to this Mr. Chillingly , "
160127	160205	160061	160061	he	3719	" and we must make it as pleasant for him as we can . I will bring down my friend Sir Thomas , and you ask Mr. Emlyn and his wife . Sir Thomas is a very sensible man , and Emlyn a very learned one . So Mr. Chillingly will find people worth talking to . By the by , when I go to town I will send down a haunch of venison from Groves 's . "
160279	160295	160272	160272	Kenelm	261	" I thought I was to meet Mrs. Cameron . I do n't see her . "
160296	160328	160272	160272	Kenelm	261	" She will be here presently . It looks as if it might rain , and I have sent the carriage for her and Lily . Ah , here they are ! "
160612	160636	160607	160608	Sir Thomas	579	" I think , Mr. Chillingly , we have met before , though I had not the honour then of making your acquaintance . "
160644	160657	160641	160641	he	579	" Not long ago ; the last State ball at Buckingham Palace . "
160671	160691	160641	160641	he	579	" You were talking with a very charming woman , - a friend of mine , - Lady Glenalvon . "
160700	160705	160707	160707	Kenelm	261	" I remember perfectly , "
160709	160737	160707	160707	Kenelm	261	" We were seated in the picture gallery . You came to speak to Lady Glenalvon , and I yielded to you my place on the settee . "
160738	160762	160763	160763	Kenelm	261	" Quite true ; and I think you joined a young lady , very handsome , - the great heiress , Miss Travers . "
160891	160916	160859	160859	She	206	" Sir Thomas spoke about a Miss Travers : is she related to a gentleman who was once in the Guards , Leopold Travers ? "
160917	160930	160859	160859	She	206	" She is his daughter . Did you ever know Leopold Travers ? "
160931	160948	160950	160951	Mrs. Cameron	206	" I have heard him mentioned by friends of mine long ago , - long ago , "
160985	161015	160859	160859	She	206	" Lily tells me , Mr. Chillingly , that you said you were staying at Mr. Jones 's , Cromwell Lodge . I hope you are made comfortable there . "
161016	161025	160963	160963	her	206	" Very . The situation is singularly pleasant . "
161026	161113	160859	160859	She	206	" Yes , it is considered the prettiest spot on the brook - side , and used to be a favourite resort for anglers ; but the trout , I believe , are growing scarce ; at least , now that the fishing in the Thames is improved , poor Mr. Jones complains that his old lodgers desert him . Of course you took the rooms for the sake of the fishing . I hope the sport may be better than it is said to be . "
161114	161170	160963	160963	her	206	" It is of little consequence to me : I do not care much about fishing ; and since Miss Mordaunt calls the book which first enticed me to take to it ' a cruel one , ' I feel as if the trout had become as sacred as crocodiles were to the ancient Egyptians . "
161171	161229	160859	160859	She	206	" Lily is a foolish child on such matters . She can not bear the thought of giving pain to any dumb creature ; and just before our garden there are a few trout which she has tamed . They feed out of her hand ; she is always afraid they will wander away and get caught . "
161230	161238	160963	160963	her	206	" But Mr. Melville is an angler ? "
161239	161297	160859	160859	She	206	" Several years ago he would sometimes pretend to fish , but I believe it was rather an excuse for lying on the grass and reading ' the cruel book , ' or perhaps , rather , for sketching . But now he is seldom here till autumn , when it grows too cold for such amusement . "
161544	161644	161541	161541	he	570	" She is one of those women in whom quiet is so predominant that it is long before one can know what undercurrents of good feeling flow beneath the unruffled surface . I wish , however , she was a little more active in the management and education of her niece , - a girl in whom I feel a very anxious interest , and whom I doubt if Mrs. Cameron understands . Perhaps , however , only a poet , and a very peculiar sort of poet , can understand her : Lily Mordaunt is herself a poem . "
161645	161653	161655	161655	Kenelm	261	" I like your definition of her , "
161657	161674	161655	161655	Kenelm	261	" There is certainly something about her which differs much from the prose of common life . "
161675	161682	161541	161541	he	570	" You probably know Wordsworth 's lines :
161683	161718	161655	161655	Kenelm	261	" ' ... and she shall lean her ear In many a secret place Where rivulets dance their wayward round , And beauty , born of murmuring sound , Shall pass into her face . '
161719	161740	161541	161541	he	570	" They are lines that many critics have found unintelligible ; but Lily seems like the living key to them . "
161754	161757	161759	161760	Mr. Emlyn	570	" Only , "
161762	161799	161759	161760	Mr. Emlyn	570	" how a girl of that sort , left wholly to herself , untrained , undisciplined , is to grow up into the practical uses of womanhood , is a question that perplexes and saddens me . "
161800	161805	161807	161808	the host	1039	" Any more wine ? "
161820	161830	161817	161818	Sir Thomas	579	" No ? - shall we join the ladies ? "
161878	161892	161871	161872	the former	1628	" What sort of man is Miss Cameron 's guardian , Mr. Melville ? "
161893	161985	161871	161872	the former	1628	" I can scarcely answer that question . I see little of him when he comes here . Formerly , he used to run down pretty often with a harum - scarum set of young fellows , quartered at Cromwell Lodge , - Grasmere had no accommodation for them , - students in the Academy , I suppose . For some years he has not brought those persons , and when he does come himself it is but for a few days . He has the reputation of being very wild . "
162054	162061	162063	162063	Elsie	340	" I hope , Mr. Emlyn , "
162068	162091	162063	162063	Elsie	340	" that you have dissuaded Mr. Chillingly from turning Papist . I am sure you have taken time enough to do so . "
162108	162114	162092	162093	Mr. Emlyn	570	" Do you meditate turning - "
162122	162198	162200	162200	Kenelm	261	" Be not alarmed , my dear sir . I did but own to Mrs. Braefield that I had paid a visit to Oxford in order to confer with a learned man on a question that puzzled me , and as abstract as that feminine pastime , theology , is now - a - days . I can not convince Mrs. Braefield that Oxford admits other puzzles in life than those which amuse the ladies . "
162219	162225	162211	162211	Lily	526	" Have I offended again ? "
162236	162263	162264	162264	Lily	526	" I suspect , Miss Mordaunt , that among your good qualities , nature has omitted one ; the bettermost self within you should replace it . "
162291	162299	162264	162264	Lily	526	" How ! what do you mean ? "
162300	162309	162211	162211	Lily	526	" Am I to answer politely or truthfully ? "
162310	162323	162264	162264	Lily	526	" Truthfully ! Oh , truthfully ! What is life without truth ? "
162324	162332	162211	162211	Lily	526	" Even though one believes in fairies ? "
162333	162358	162264	162264	Lily	526	" Fairies are truthful , in a certain way . But you are not truthful . You were not thinking of fairies when you - "
162359	162364	162211	162211	Lily	526	" When I what ? "
162365	162371	162264	162264	Lily	526	" Found fault with me . "
162372	162501	162211	162211	Lily	526	" I am not sure of that . But I will translate to you my thoughts , so far as I can read them myself , and to do so I will resort to the fairies . Let us suppose that a fairy has placed her changeling into the cradle of a mortal : that into the cradle she drops all manner of fairy gifts which are not bestowed on mere mortals ; but that one mortal attribute she forgets . The changeling grows up ; she charms those around her : they humour , and pet , and spoil her . But there arises a moment in which the omission of the one mortal gift is felt by her admirers and friends . Guess what that is . "
162505	162519	162502	162502	Lily	526	" I see what you mean ; the reverse of truthfulness , politeness . "
162520	162583	162211	162211	Lily	526	" No , not exactly that , though politeness slides into it unawares : it is a very humble quality , a very unpoetic quality ; a quality that many dull people possess ; and yet without it no fairy can fascinate mortals , when on the face of the fairy settles the first wrinkle . Can you not guess it now ? "
162584	162595	162597	162597	Lily	526	" No : you vex me ; you provoke me ; "
162615	162622	162608	162608	she	526	" Speak plainly , I insist . "
162623	162634	162636	162636	Kenelm	261	" Miss Mordaunt , excuse me : I dare not , "
162731	162742	162744	162744	she	526	" Who would not rather walk on such a night ? "
162768	162791	162750	162751	Mrs. Cameron	206	" You are too considerate , dear Mrs. Braefield ; Lily prefers walking home ; there is no chance of rain now . "
162812	162820	162822	162823	Mrs. Cameron	206	" A charming night , Mr. Chillingly , "
162825	162858	162822	162823	Mrs. Cameron	206	" An English summer night ; nothing like it in such parts of the world as I have visited . But , alas ! of English summer nights there are but few . "
162859	162866	162822	162823	Mrs. Cameron	206	" You have travelled much abroad ? "
162867	162879	162822	162823	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Much , no , a little ; chiefly on foot . "
162914	162920	162941	162941	she	526	" You have been abroad ; "
162946	162950	162941	162941	she	526	" Mr. Chillingly , "
162958	162998	162941	162941	she	526	" What a breadth of meaning the word ' abroad ' conveys ! Away , afar from one 's self , from one 's everyday life . How I envy you ! you have been abroad : so has Lion "
163004	163013	162941	162941	she	526	" I mean my guardian , Mr. Melville . "
163014	163062	163096	163096	She	206	" Certainly , I have been abroad , but afar from myself - never . It is an old saying , - all old sayings are true ; most new sayings are false , - a man carries his native soil at the sole of his foot . "
163100	163114	163096	163096	She	206	" You are walking in the wet , and with those thin shoes . "
163213	163231	163209	163209	He	261	" Can you forgive me for my rude words ? I presumed to find fault with you . "
163232	163279	163209	163209	He	261	" And so justly . I have been thinking over all you said , and I feel you were so right ; only I still do not quite understand what you meant by the quality for mortals which the fairy did not give to her changeling . "
163280	163300	163209	163209	He	261	" If I did not dare say it before , I should still less dare to say it now . "
163301	163304	163209	163209	He	261	" Do . "
163330	163334	163320	163320	her	4111	" I insist ; "
163336	163339	163209	163209	He	261	" Do ; "
163369	163400	163359	163359	himself	261	" The quality desirable for men , but more essential to women in proportion as they are fairy - like , though the tritest thing possible , is good temper . "
163448	163459	163461	163462	Mrs. Cameron	206	" I do n't ask you in at this hour , "
163464	163473	163461	163462	Mrs. Cameron	206	" It would be but a false compliment . "
163495	163505	163506	163506	she	206	" I shall consider your words , Mr. Chillingly , "
163515	163534	163506	163506	she	206	" At present I think you are not right . I am not ill - tempered ; but - "
163562	163570	163536	163536	she	206	" in any case I forgive you . "
163629	163634	163671	163672	Mr. B	586	" the aristocratic class , "
163761	163764	163765	163766	The Braefields	587	" aristocracy . "
164000	164004	164006	164006	he	4048	" You understand , "
164008	164115	164006	164006	he	4048	" that it will be from no want of courtesy on the part of my neighbours if they do not offer you any relief from the pleasures of solitude . It will be simply because they are shy , not because they are uncivil . And , it is this consideration that makes me , at the risk of seeming too forward , entreat you to look into the vicarage any morning or evening on which you feel tired of your own company ; suppose you drink tea with us this evening , - you will find a young lady whose heart you have already won . "
164116	164123	164125	164125	Kenelm	261	" Whose heart I have won ! "
164136	164139	164141	164142	the vicar	4048	" But , "
164170	164170	164168	164168	Clemmy	530	"
164171	164193	164141	164142	the vicar	4048	" Clemmy ! - she is your daughter ? I did not know that . I very gratefully accept your invitation . "
164194	164220	164168	164168	Clemmy	530	" I must not keep you longer from your amusement . The sky is just clouded enough for sport . What fly do you use ? "
164221	164253	164141	164142	the vicar	4048	" To say truth , I doubt if the stream has much to tempt me in the way of trout , and I prefer rambling about the lanes and by - paths to
164254	164263	164168	164168	Clemmy	530	" ' The noiseless angler 's solitary stand . '
164264	164286	164288	164288	Kenelm	261	" I am an indefatigable walker , and the home scenery round the place has many charms for me . Besides , "
164315	164349	164293	164293	he	261	" besides , I intend to devote myself a good deal to reading . I have been very idle of late , and the solitude of this place must be favourable to study . "
164350	164366	164168	164168	Clemmy	530	" You are not intended , I presume , for any of the learned professions ? "
164367	164372	164374	164374	Kenelm	261	" The learned professions , "
164376	164504	164374	164374	Kenelm	261	" is an invidious form of speech that we are doing our best to eradicate from the language . All professions now - a - days are to have much about the same amount of learning . The learning of the military profession is to be levelled upwards , the learning of the scholastic to be levelled downwards . Cabinet ministers sneer at the uses of Greek and Latin . And even such masculine studies as Law and Medicine are to be adapted to the measurements of taste and propriety in colleges for young ladies . No , I am not intended for any profession ; but still an ignorant man like myself may not be the worse for a little book - reading now and then . "
164505	164516	164518	164519	the vicar	4048	" You seem to be badly provided with books here , "
164558	164581	164374	164374	Kenelm	261	" But , as I before said , my library is at your service . What branch of reading do you prefer ? "
164597	164701	164594	164594	he	261	" The more remote it be from the present day , the better for me . You said your collection was rich in mediaeval literature . But the Middle Ages are so copied by the modern Goths , that I might as well read translations of Chaucer or take lodgings in Wardour Street . If you have any books about the manners and habits of those who , according to the newest idea in science , were our semi - human progenitors in the transition state between a marine animal and a gorilla , I should be very much edified by the loan . "
164702	164705	164707	164708	Mr. Emlyn	570	" Alas , "
164712	164722	164707	164708	Mr. Emlyn	570	" no such books have been left to us . "
164723	165129	164594	164594	he	261	" No such books ? You must be mistaken . There must be plenty of them somewhere . I grant all the wonderful powers of invention bestowed on the creators of poetic romance ; still not the sovereign masters in that realm of literature - not Scott , not Cervantes , not Goethe , not even Shakspeare - could have presumed to rebuild the past without such materials as they found in the books that record it . And though I , no less cheerfully , grant that we have now living among us a creator of poetic romance immeasurably more inventive than they , - appealing to our credulity in portents the most monstrous , with a charm of style the most conversationally familiar , - still I can not conceive that even that unrivalled romance - writer can so bewitch our understandings as to make us believe that , if Miss Mordaunt 's cat dislikes to wet her feet , it is probably because in the prehistoric age her ancestors lived in the dry country of Egypt ; or that when some lofty orator , a Pitt or a Gladstone , rebuts with a polished smile which reveals his canine teeth the rude assault of an opponent , he betrays his descent from a ' semi - human progenitor ' who was accustomed to snap at his enemy . Surely , surely there must be some books still extant written by philosophers before the birth of Adam , in which there is authority , even though but in mythic fable , for such poetic inventions . Surely , surely some early chroniclers must depose that they saw , saw with their own eyes , the great gorillas who scratched off their hairy coverings to please the eyes of the young ladies of their species , and that they noted the gradual metamorphosis of one animal into another . For , if you tell me that this illustrious romance - writer is but a cautious man of science , and that we must accept his inventions according to the sober laws of evidence and fact , there is not the most incredible ghost story which does not better satisfy the common sense of a sceptic . However , if you have no such books , lend me the most unphilosophical you possess , - on magic , for instance , - the philosopher 's stone "
165131	165138	165140	165141	the vicar	4048	" I have some of them , "
165145	165152	165140	165141	the vicar	4048	" you shall choose for yourself . "
165153	165194	164707	164708	Mr. Emlyn	570	" If you are going homeward , let me accompany you part of the way : I do n't yet know where the church and the vicarage are , and I ought to know before I come in the evening . "
165345	165350	165321	165322	The girl	1594	" God bless you . "
165367	165395	165364	165365	Mr. Emlyn	570	" Is there a greater link between this life and the next than God 's blessing on the young , breathed from the lips of the old ? "
165398	165409	165411	165412	the vicar	4048	" AND how is your good man , Mrs. Haley ? "
165446	165474	165411	165412	the vicar	4048	" Thank you kindly , sir , he is better ; out of his bed now . The young lady has done him a power of good - "
165475	165478	165480	165480	Lily	526	" Hush ! "
165484	165500	165480	165480	Lily	526	" Make haste home now ; you must not keep him waiting for his dinner . "
165515	165523	165525	165526	Mr. Emlyn	570	" Do you know , Mr. Chillingly , "
165528	165560	165525	165526	Mr. Emlyn	570	" that Miss Mordaunt is the best doctor in the place ? Though if she goes on making so many cures she will find the number of her patients rather burdensome . "
165561	165569	165571	165571	Lily	526	" It was only the other day , "
165573	165587	165571	165571	Lily	526	" that you scolded me for the best cure I have yet made . "
165588	165625	165525	165526	Mr. Emlyn	570	" I ? - Oh ! I remember ; you led that silly child Madge to believe that there was a fairy charm in the arrowroot you sent her . Own you deserved a scolding there . "
165626	165687	165571	165571	Lily	526	" No , I did not . I dressed the arrowroot , and am I not Fairy ? I have just got such a pretty note from Clemmy , Mr. Emlyn , asking me to come up this evening and see her new magic lantern . Will you tell her to expect me ? And , mind , no scolding . "
165688	165693	165695	165696	Mr. Emlyn	570	" And all magic ? "
165698	165703	165695	165696	Mr. Emlyn	570	" be it so . "
165739	165750	165731	165731	she	526	" I suppose you have been fishing all the morning ? "
165751	165772	165722	165722	her	526	" No ; the fishes hereabout are under the protection of a Fairy , - whom I dare not displease . "
165789	165805	165779	165779	she	526	" Good - day ; I hear aunty 's voice : those dreadful French verbs ! "
165827	165836	165838	165839	Mr. Emlyn	570	" That child has a heart of gold , "
165848	166021	165838	165839	Mr. Emlyn	570	" I did not exaggerate when I said she was the best doctor in the place . I believe the poor really do believe that she is a fairy . Of course we send from the vicarage to our ailing parishioners who require it , food and wine ; but it never seems to do them the good that her little dishes made by her own tiny hands do ; and I do n't know if you noticed the basket that old woman took away , - Miss Lily taught Will Somers to make the prettiest little baskets ; and she puts her jellies or other savouries into dainty porcelain gallipots nicely fitted into the baskets , which she trims with ribbons . It is the look of the thing that tempts the appetite of the invalids , and certainly the child may well be called Fairy at present ; but I wish Mrs. Cameron would attend a little more strictly to her education . She ca n't be a fairy forever . "
166102	166110	166112	166113	the vicar	4048	" You will know your way now , "
166115	166169	166112	166113	the vicar	4048	" excuse me if I quit you : I have a few visits to make ; among others , to poor Haley , husband to the old woman you saw . I read to him a chapter in the Bible every day ; yet still I fancy that he believes in fairy charms . "
166170	166180	166185	166185	he	261	" Better believe too much , than too little , "
166524	166530	166531	166531	she	526	" You here , too ? "
166539	166542	166531	166531	she	526	" Too ! "
166548	166621	166531	166531	she	526	" too ! ' Tis no wonder that I , a stranger to the place , should find my steps attracted towards its most venerable building . Even the most careless traveller , halting at some remote abodes of the living , turns aside to gaze on the burial - ground of the dead . But my surprise is that you , Miss Mordaunt , should be attracted towards the same spot . "
166622	166629	166631	166631	Lily	526	" It is my favourite spot , "
166633	166741	166743	166743	Lily	526	" and always has been . I have sat many an hour on that tombstone . It is strange to think that no one knows who sleeps beneath it . The ' Guide Book to Moleswich , ' though it gives the history of the church from the reign in which it was first built , can only venture a guess that this tomb , the grandest and oldest in the burial - ground , is tenanted by some member of a family named Montfichet , that was once very powerful in the county , and has become extinct since the reign of Henry VI . But , "
166745	166779	166781	166781	she	526	" there is not a letter of the name Montfichet left . I found out more than any one else has done ; I learned black - letter on purpose ; look here , "
166795	166838	166781	166781	she	526	" Do you see those figures ? are they not XVIII ? and look again , in what was once the line above the figures , ELE . It must have been an Eleanor , who died at the age of eighteen - "
166839	166954	166781	166781	she	526	" I rather think it more probable that the figures refer to the date of the death , 1318 perhaps ; and so far as I can decipher black - letter , which is more in my father 's line than mine , I think it is AL , not EL , and that it seems as if there had been a letter between L and the second E , which is now effaced . The tomb itself is not likely to belong to any powerful family then resident at the place . Their monuments , according to usage , would have been within the church , - probably in their own mortuary chapel . "
166955	166964	166966	166966	Lily	526	" Do n't try to destroy my fancy , "
166972	167048	166966	166966	Lily	526	" you can not succeed , I know her history too well . She was young , and some one loved her , and built over her the finest tomb he could afford ; and see how long the epitaph must have been ! how much it must have spoken in her praise and of his grief . And then he went his way , and the tomb was neglected , and her fate forgotten . "
167049	167093	166781	166781	she	526	" My dear Miss Mordaunt , this is indeed a wild romance to spin out of so slender a thread . But even if true , there is no reason to think that a life is forgotten , though a tomb be neglected . "
167094	167098	167100	167100	Lily	526	" Perhaps not , "
167104	167137	167100	167100	Lily	526	" But when I am dead , if I can look down , I think it would please me to see my grave not neglected by those who had loved me once . "
167209	167273	167190	167190	she	526	" She was the little grandchild of poor old Mrs. Hales . I could not cure her , though I tried hard : she was so fond of me , and died in my arms . No , let me not say ' died , ' - surely there is no such thing as dying . ' Tis but a change of life , -
167294	167294	167190	167190	she	526	"
167295	167301	167303	167303	Kenelm	261	" Whose lines are those ? "
167305	167326	167190	167190	she	526	" I do n't know ; I learnt them from Lion . Do n't you believe them to be true ? "
167327	167386	167190	167190	she	526	" Yes . But the truth does not render the thought of quitting this scene of life for another more pleasing to most of us . See how soft and gentle and bright is all that living summer land beyond ; let us find subject for talk from that , not from the graveyard on which we stand . "
167387	167424	167190	167190	she	526	" But is there not a summer land fairer than that we see now ; and which we do see , as in a dream , best when we take subjects of talk from the graveyard ? "
167435	167526	167431	167431	Lily	526	" I planted these flowers : Mr. Emlyn was angry with me ; he said it was ' Popish . ' But he had not the heart to have them taken up ; I come here very often to see to them . Do you think it wrong ? Poor little Nell ! she was so fond of flowers . And the Eleanor in the great tomb , she too perhaps knew some one who called her Nell ; but there are no flowers round her tomb . Poor Eleanor ! "
167604	167688	167597	167597	her	526	" I told you I would think over what you said to me last night . I have done so , and feel I can thank you honestly . You were very kind : I never before thought that I had a bad temper ; no one ever told me so . But I see now what you mean ; sometimes I feel very quickly , and then I show it . But how did I show it to you , Mr. Chillingly ? "
167689	167722	167597	167597	her	526	" Did you not turn your back to me when I seated myself next you in Mrs. Braefield 's garden , vouchsafing me no reply when I asked if I had offended ? "
167741	167762	167737	167737	she	526	" I was not offended ; I was not in a bad temper then : it was worse than that . "
167763	167772	167597	167597	her	526	" Worse ? what could it possibly be ? "
167773	167781	167737	167737	she	526	" I am afraid it was envy . "
167782	167790	167597	167597	her	526	" Envy of what ? of whom ? "
167791	167857	167737	167737	she	526	" I do n't know how to explain ; after all , I fear aunty is right , and the fairy tales put very silly , very naughty thoughts into one 's head . When Cinderella 's sisters went to the king 's ball , and Cinderella was left alone , did not she long to go too ? Did not she envy her sisters ? "
167858	167873	167597	167597	her	526	" Ah ! I understand now : Sir Charles spoke of the Court Ball . "
167874	167896	167737	167737	she	526	" And you were there talking with handsome ladies - and - oh ! I was so foolish and felt sore . "
167897	167955	167597	167597	her	526	" You , who when we first met wondered how people who could live in the country preferred to live in towns , do then sometimes contradict yourself , and sigh for the great world that lies beyond these quiet water banks . You feel that you have youth and beauty , and wish to be admired ! "
167956	167963	167965	167965	Lily	526	" It is not that exactly , "
167976	168011	167965	167965	Lily	526	" and in my better moments , when the ' bettermost self ' comes forth , I know that I am not made for the great world you speak of . But you see - "
168050	168054	168055	168055	she	526	" You see , "
168076	168188	168055	168055	she	526	" that at home , ever since I can remember , they have treated me as if - well , as if I were - what shall I say ? the child of one of your great ladies . Even Lion , who is so noble , so grand , seemed to think when I was a mere infant that I was a little queen : once when I told a fib he did not scold me ; but I never saw him look so sad and so angry as when he said , ' Never again forget that you are a lady . ' And , but I tire you - "
168189	168198	168055	168055	she	526	" Tire me , indeed ! go on . "
168199	168253	168254	168254	She	4196	" No , I have said enough to explain why I have at times proud thoughts , and vain thoughts ; and why , for instance , I said to myself , ' Perhaps my place of right is among those fine ladies whom he - ' but it is all over now . "
168359	168367	168369	168371	the reverend scholar	4202	" Not acquainted with Macleane 's Juvenal ? "
168373	168420	168369	168371	the reverend scholar	4202	" you will be greatly pleased with it ; here it is , - a posthumous work , edited by George Long . I can lend you Munro 's Lucretius , ' 69 . Aha ! we have some scholars yet to pit against the Germans . "
168421	168430	168432	168432	Kenelm	261	" I am heartily glad to hear it , "
168434	168473	168432	168432	Kenelm	261	" It will be a long time before they will ever wish to rival us in that game which Miss Clemmy is now forming on the lawn , and in which England has recently acquired a European reputation . "
168474	168484	168369	168371	the reverend scholar	4202	" I do n't take you . What game ? "
168485	168515	168516	168516	Kenelm	261	" Puss in the Corner . With your leave I will look out and see whether it be a winning game for puss - in the long - run . "
168662	168669	168671	168671	she	585	" I suppose , Mr. Chillingly , "
168673	168740	168671	168671	she	585	" I ought to apologize for my husband 's invitation to what must seem to you so frivolous an entertainment as a child 's party . But when Mr. Emlyn asked you to come to us this evening , he was not aware that Clemmy had also invited her young friends . He had looked forward to rational conversation with you on his own favourite studies . "
168741	168772	168797	168798	Mrs. Emlyn	585	" It is not so long since I left school , but that I prefer a half holiday to lessons , even from a tutor so pleasant as Mr. Emlyn , -
168773	168791	168671	168671	she	585	" ' Ah , happy years , - once more who would not be a boy ! ' "
168792	168795	168797	168798	Mrs. Emlyn	585	" Nay , "
168805	168832	168797	168798	Mrs. Emlyn	585	" Who that had started so fairly as Mr. Chillingly in the career of man would wish to go back and resume a place among boys ? "
168833	168936	168671	168671	she	585	" But , my dear Mrs. Emlyn , the line I quoted was wrung from the heart of a man who had already outstripped all rivals in the race - ground he had chosen , and who at that moment was in the very Maytime of youth and of fame . And if such a man at such an epoch in his career could sigh to ' be once more a boy , ' it must have been when he was thinking of the boy 's half holiday , and recoiling from the task work he was condemned to learn as man . "
168937	168989	168797	168798	Mrs. Emlyn	585	" The line you quote is , I think , from ' Childe Harold , ' and surely you would not apply to mankind in general the sentiment of a poet so peculiarly self - reflecting if I may use that expression , and in whom sentiment is often so morbid . "
168990	168998	169000	169000	Kenelm	261	" You are right , Mrs. Emlyn , "
169004	169045	169000	169000	Kenelm	261	" Still a boy 's half holiday is a very happy thing ; and among mankind in general there must be many who would be glad to have it back again , - Mr. Emlyn himself , I should think . "
169046	169126	168671	168671	she	585	" Mr. Emlyn has his half holiday now . Do you not see him standing just outside the window ? Do you not hear him laughing ? He is a child again in the mirth of his children . I hope you will stay some time in the neighbourhood ; I am sure you and he will like each other . And it is such a rare delight to him to get a scholar like yourself to talk to . "
169127	169162	169000	169000	Kenelm	261	" Pardon me , I am not a scholar ; a very noble title that , and not to be given to a lazy trifler on the surface of book - lore like myself . "
169163	169198	168671	168671	she	585	" You are too modest . My husband has a copy of your Cambridge prize verses , and says ' the Latinity of them is quite beautiful . ' I quote his very words . "
169199	169289	169000	169000	Kenelm	261	" Latin verse - making is a mere knack , little more than a proof that one had an elegant scholar for one 's tutor , as I certainly had . But it is by special grace that a real scholar can send forth another real scholar , and a Kennedy produce a Munro . But to return to the more interesting question of half holidays ; I declare that Clemmy is leading off your husband in triumph . He is actually going to be Puss in the Corner . "
169290	169437	168671	168671	she	585	" When you know more of Charles , - I mean my husband , - you will discover that his whole life is more or less of a holiday . Perhaps because he is not what you accuse yourself of being : he is not lazy ; he never wishes to be a boy once more ; and taskwork itself is holiday to him . He enjoys shutting himself up in his study and reading ; he enjoys a walk with the children ; he enjoys visiting the poor ; he enjoys his duties as a clergyman . And though I am not always contented for him , though I think he should have had those honours in his profession which have been lavished on men with less ability and less learning , yet he is never discontented himself . Shall I tell you his secret ? "
169438	169441	169000	169000	Kenelm	261	" Do . "
169442	169494	168671	168671	she	585	" He is a Thanks - giving Man . You , too , must have much to thank God for , Mr. Chillingly ; and in thanksgiving to God does there not blend usefulness to man , and such sense of pastime in the usefulness as makes each day a holiday ? "
169516	169522	169524	169524	he	261	" I see , ma'am , "
169526	169554	169524	169524	he	261	" that you have devoted much thought to the study of the aesthetical philosophy as expounded by German thinkers , whom it is rather difficult to understand . "
169555	169575	168671	168671	she	585	" I , Mr. Chillingly ! good gracious ! No ! What do you mean by your aesthetical philosophy ? "
169576	169684	169524	169524	he	261	" According to aesthetics , I believe man arrives at his highest state of moral excellence when labour and duty lose all the harshness of effort , - when they become the impulse and habit of life ; when as the essential attributes of the beautiful , they are , like beauty , enjoyed as pleasure ; and thus , as you expressed , each day becomes a holiday : a lovely doctrine , not perhaps so lofty as that of the Stoics , but more bewitching . Only , very few of us can practically merge our cares and our worries into so serene an atmosphere . "
169685	169710	168671	168671	she	585	" Some do so without knowing anything of aesthetics and with no pretence to be Stoics ; but , then , they are Christians . "
169711	169798	169800	169800	Kenelm	261	" There are some such Christians , no doubt ; but they are rarely to be met with . Take Christendom altogether , and it appears to comprise the most agitated population in the world ; the population in which there is the greatest grumbling as to the quantity of labour to be done , the loudest complaints that duty instead of a pleasure is a very hard and disagreeable struggle , and in which holidays are fewest and the moral atmosphere least serene . Perhaps , "
169812	169964	169800	169800	Kenelm	261	" it is this perpetual consciousness of struggle ; this difficulty in merging toil into ease , or stern duty into placid enjoyment ; this refusal to ascend for one 's self into the calm of an air aloof from the cloud which darkens , and the hail - storm which beats upon , the fellow - men we leave below , - that makes the troubled life of Christendom dearer to Heaven , and more conducive to Heaven 's design in rendering earth the wrestling - ground and not the resting - place of man , than is that of the Brahmin , ever seeking to abstract himself from the Christian 's conflicts of action and desire , and to carry into its extremest practice the aesthetic theory , of basking undisturbed in the contemplation of the most absolute beauty human thought can reflect from its idea of divine good ! "
170425	170435	170437	170438	Mr. Emlyn	570	" It is a lovely night , Mrs. Cameron , "
170440	170450	170437	170438	Mr. Emlyn	570	" and I will attend you to your gate . "
170451	170456	170458	170458	Kenelm	261	" Permit me also , "
170460	170463	170465	170466	the vicar	4048	" Ay , "
170468	170478	170465	170466	the vicar	4048	" it is your own way to Cromwell Lodge . "
170547	170553	170555	170555	she	526	" How silly I was , "
170557	170595	170555	170555	she	526	" to be so frightened at the false ghost ! I do n't think a real one would frighten me , at least if seen here , in this loving moonlight , and on God 's ground ! "
170596	170650	170532	170532	She	526	" Ghosts , were they permitted to appear except in a magic lantern , could not harm the innocent . And I wonder why the idea of their apparition should always have been associated with such phantasies of horror , especially by sinless children , who have the least reason to dread them . "
170651	170658	170660	170660	Lily	526	" Oh , that is true , "
170662	170698	170660	170660	Lily	526	" but even when we are grown up there must be times in which we should so long to see a ghost , and feel what a comfort , what a joy it would be . "
170699	170806	170532	170532	She	526	" I understand you . If some one very dear to us had vanished from our life ; if we felt the anguish of the separation so intensely as to efface the thought that life , as you said so well , ' never dies ; ' well , yes , then I can conceive that the mourner would yearn to have a glimpse of the vanished one , were it but to ask the sole and only question he could desire to put , ' Art thou happy ? May I hope that we shall meet again , never to part , - never ? ' "
170850	170858	170860	170860	Lily	526	" You have never yet felt this ? "
170881	170922	170860	170860	Lily	526	" I ? No . I have never yet lost one whom I so loved and so yearned to see again . I was but thinking that such losses may befall us all ere we too vanish out of sight . "
170923	170926	170929	170930	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Lily ! "
170942	170947	170860	170860	Lily	526	" Yes , auntie ? "
170948	170971	170860	170860	Lily	526	" Mr. Emlyn wants to know how far you have got in ' Numa Pompilius . ' Come and answer for yourself . "
170972	170982	170984	170984	Lily	526	" Oh , those tiresome grown - up people ! "
170991	171025	170984	170984	Lily	526	" I do like Mr. Emlyn ; he is one of the very best of men . But still he is grown up , and his ' Numa Pompilius ' is so stupid . "
171026	171069	170860	170860	Lily	526	" My first French lesson - book . No , it is not stupid . Read on . It has hints of the prettiest fairy tale I know , and of the fairy in especial who bewitched my fancies as a boy . "
171084	171092	171094	171094	Lily	526	" What fairy tale ? what fairy ? "
171099	171154	170860	170860	Lily	526	" She was a fairy , though in heathen language she is called a nymph , - Egeria . She was the link between men and gods to him she loved ; she belongs to the race of gods . True , she , too , may vanish , but she can never die . "
171155	171161	171163	171164	the vicar	4048	" Well , Miss Lily , "
171166	171183	171163	171164	the vicar	4048	" and how far in the book I lent you , - ' Numa Pompilius . ' "
171184	171192	170860	170860	Lily	526	" Ask me this day next week . "
171193	171214	171163	171164	the vicar	4048	" I will ; but mind you are to translate as you go on . I must see the translation . "
171215	171225	171227	171227	Lily	526	" Very well . I will do my best , "
171251	171265	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" I will go on with you to the bridge , Mr. Chillingly , "
171279	171305	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" We had little time to look over my books , and , by the by , I hope you at least took the Juvenal . "
171306	171367	171242	171243	Mrs. Cameron	206	" No , Mr. Emlyn ; who can quit your house with an inclination for satire ? I must come some morning and select a volume from those works which give pleasant views of life and bequeath favourable impressions of mankind . Your wife , with whom I have had an interesting conversation , upon the principles of aesthetical philosophy - "
171368	171381	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" My wife ! Charlotte ! She knows nothing about aesthetical philosophy . "
171382	171416	171242	171243	Mrs. Cameron	206	" She calls it by another name , but she understands it well enough to illustrate the principles by example . She tells me that labour and duty are so taken up by you -
171441	171441	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	"
171442	171541	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" I am sure that Charlotte never said anything half so poetical . But , in plain words , the days pass with me very happily . I should be ungrateful if I were not happy . Heaven has bestowed on me so many sources of love , - wife , children , books , and the calling which , when one quits one 's own threshold , carries love along with it into the world beyond ; a small world in itself , - only a parish , - but then my calling links it with infinity . "
171542	171561	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" I see ; it is from the sources of love that you draw the supplies for happiness . "
171562	171621	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" Surely ; without love one may be good , but one could scarcely be happy . No one can dream of a heaven except as the abode of love . What writer is it who says , ' How well the human heart was understood by him who first called God by the name of Father ' ? "
171622	171653	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" I do not remember , but it is beautifully said . You evidently do not subscribe to the arguments in Decimus Roach 's ' Approach to the Angels . ' "
171654	171761	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" Ah , Mr. Chillingly ! your words teach me how lacerated a man 's happiness may be if he does not keep the claws of vanity closely pared . I actually feel a keen pang when you speak to me of that eloquent panegyric on celibacy , ignorant that the only thing I ever published which I fancied was not without esteem by intellectual readers is a Reply to ' The Approach to the Angels , ' - a youthful book , written in the first year of my marriage . But it obtained success : I have just revised the tenth edition of it . "
171762	171827	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" That is the book I will select from your library . You will be pleased to hear that Mr. Roach , whom I saw at Oxford a few days ago , recants his opinions , and , at the age of fifty , is about to be married ; he begs me to add , ' not for his own personal satisfaction . ' "
171828	171848	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" Going to be married ! - Decimus Roach ! I thought my Reply would convince him at last . "
171849	171866	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" I shall look to your Reply to remove some lingering doubts in my own mind . "
171867	171874	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" Doubts in favour of celibacy ? "
171875	171888	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" Well , if not for laymen , perhaps for a priesthood . "
171889	171948	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" The most forcible part of my Reply is on that head : read it attentively . I think that , of all sections of mankind , the clergy are those to whom , not only for their own sakes , but for the sake of the community , marriage should be most commended . Why , sir , "
171959	172281	171267	171268	the vicar	4048	" are you not aware that there are no homes in England from which men who have served and adorned their country have issued forth in such prodigal numbers as those of the clergy of our Church ? What other class can produce a list so crowded with eminent names as we can boast in the sons we have reared and sent forth into the world ? How many statesmen , soldiers , sailors , lawyers , physicians , authors , men of science , have been the sons of us village pastors ? Naturally : for with us they receive careful education ; they acquire of necessity the simple tastes and disciplined habits which lead to industry and perseverance ; and , for the most part , they carry with them throughout life a purer moral code , a more systematic reverence for things and thoughts religious , associated with their earliest images of affection and respect , than can be expected from the sons of laymen whose parents are wholly temporal and worldly . Sir , I maintain that this is a cogent argument , to be considered well by the nation , not only in favour of a married clergy , - for , on that score , a million of Roaches could not convert public opinion in this country , - but in favour of the Church , the Established Church , which has been so fertile a nursery of illustrious laymen ; and I have often thought that one main and undetected cause of the lower tone of morality , public and private , of the greater corruption of manners , of the more prevalent scorn of religion which we see , for instance , in a country so civilized as France , is , that its clergy can train no sons to carry into the contests of earth the steadfast belief in accountability to Heaven . "
172282	172291	172293	172293	Kenelm	261	" I thank you with a full heart , "
172295	172365	172293	172293	Kenelm	261	" I shall ponder well over all that you have so earnestly said . I am already disposed to give up all lingering crotchets as to a bachelor clergy ; but , as a layman , I fear that I shall never attain to the purified philanthropy of Mr. Decimus Roach , and , if ever I do marry , it will be very much for my personal satisfaction . "
172809	172812	172853	172853	he	261	" Numa Pompilius "
173134	173139	173141	173141	he	261	" She loves me . "
173146	173155	173141	173141	he	261	" She knows not yet what love is . "
173342	173349	173350	173350	He	570	" his well - known benevolence . "
173517	173657	173501	173504	a young sister of	4290	" into conversion to the Roman Catholic faith , and had since entered a convent . His affections had been deeply wounded by this loss to the range of them . Mr. Emlyn had also his little infirmities of self - esteem rather than of vanity . Though he had seen very little of any world beyond that of his parish , he piqued himself on his knowledge of human nature and of practical affairs in general . Certainly no man had read more about them , especially in the books of the ancient classics . Perhaps it was owing to this that he so little understood Lily , - a character to which the ancient classics afforded no counterpart nor clue ; and perhaps it was this also that made Lily think him ' so terribly grown up . "
174143	174151	174152	174152	she	340	" I am so glad to think , "
174172	174247	174152	174152	she	340	" that you have made such friends with Mr. Emlyn . Though all hereabouts like him so much for his goodness , there are few who can appreciate his learning . To you it must be a surprise as well as pleasure to find , in this quiet humdrum place , a companion so clever and well - informed : it compensates for your disappointment in discovering that our brook yields such bad sport . "
174248	174338	174152	174152	she	340	" Do n't disparage the brook ; it yields the pleasantest banks on which to lie down under old pollard oaks at noon , or over which to saunter at morn and eve . Where those charms are absent even a salmon could not please . Yes ; I rejoice to have made friends with Mr. Emlyn . I have learned a great deal from him , and am often asking myself whether I shall ever make peace with my conscience by putting what I have learned into practice . "
174339	174351	174152	174152	she	340	" May I ask what special branch of learning is that ? "
174352	174673	174152	174152	she	340	" I scarcely know how to define it . Suppose we call it ' Worth - whileism . ' Among the New Ideas which I was recommended to study as those that must govern my generation , the Not - worth - while Idea holds a very high rank ; and being myself naturally of calm and equable constitution , that new idea made the basis of my philosophical system . But since I have become intimate with Charles Emlyn I think there is a great deal to be said in favour of Worth - whileism , old idea though it be . I see a man who , with very commonplace materials for interest or amusement at his command , continues to be always interested or generally amused ; I ask myself why and how ? And it seems to me as if the cause started from fixed beliefs which settle his relations with God and man , and that settlement he will not allow any speculations to disturb . Be those beliefs questionable or not by others , at least they are such as can not displease a Deity , and can not fail to be kindly and useful to fellow - mortals . Then he plants these beliefs on the soil of a happy and genial home , which tends to confirm and strengthen and call them into daily practice ; and when he goes forth from home , even to the farthest verge of the circle that surrounds it , he carries with him the home influences of kindliness and use . Possibly my line of life may be drawn to the verge of a wider circle than his ; but so much the better for interest and amusement , if it can be drawn from the same centre ; namely , fixed beliefs daily warmed into vital action in the sunshine of a congenial home . "
174729	174762	174717	174717	she	523	" Certainly the first thing in life is to secure a happy and congenial home . It must be a terrible trial for the best of us if we marry without love . "
174763	174778	174717	174717	she	523	" Terrible , indeed , if the one loves and the other does not . "
174779	174836	174717	174717	she	523	" That can scarcely be your case , Mr. Chillingly , for I am sure you could not marry where you did not love ; and do not think I flatter you when I say that a man far less gifted than you can scarcely fail to be loved by the woman he wooes and wins . "
174913	174916	174917	174917	he	261	" Ah ! "
174921	174954	174917	174917	he	261	" I can not stay longer here , dreaming away the work - day hours in a fairy ring . I am going to town to - day by the next train . "
174955	174961	174917	174917	he	261	" Yoa are coming back ? "
174962	175019	174917	174917	he	261	" Of course , - this evening . I left no address at my lodgings in London . There must be a large accumulation of letters ; some , no doubt , from my father and mother . I am only going for them . Good - by . How kindly you have listened to me ! "
175020	175052	174917	174917	he	261	" Shall we fix a day next week for seeing the remains of the old Roman villa ? I will ask Mrs. Cameron and her niece to be of the party . "
175053	175059	175061	175061	Kenelm	261	" Any day you please , "
175256	175281	175253	175254	Sir Peter	421	" Come to Exmundham , and if I do not give my consent to propose to Cecilia Travers hold me a tyrant and rebel . "
175589	175600	175578	175579	Miss Sally	216	" which no girl after eighteen would venture to wear . "
175601	175607	175609	175610	her ladyship	858	" But , my dear , "
175612	175654	175609	175610	her ladyship	858	" your poor father 's family are certainly great oddities . I have more to put up with than any one knows . I do my best to carry it off . I know my duties , and will do them . "
175685	175707	175680	175680	she	4342	" A very handsome young lady , though rather too blonde for her taste , and certainly with an air distingue . "
175730	175794	175710	175710	she	4342	" Not at all spoilt by the education of the great world , which , alas ! obedient to the duties of wife and mother , however little my sacrifices are appreciated , I have long since relinquished . Lady Glenalvon suggests turning that hideous old moat into a fernery , - a great improvement . Of course your poor father makes objections . "
176441	176452	176873	176873	Kenelm	261	" You have a pleasant home here , Mrs. Somers . "
176453	176470	176873	176873	Kenelm	261	" We have , indeed , and know how to bless him we owe it to . "
176471	176580	176873	176873	Kenelm	261	" I am rejoiced to think that . How often when God designs a special kindness to us He puts the kindness into the heart of a fellow - man , - perhaps the last fellow - man we should have thought of ; but in blessing him we thank God who inspired him . Now , my dear friends , I know that you all three suspect me of being the agent whom God chose for His benefits . You fancy that it was from me came the loan which enabled you to leave Graveleigh and settle here . You are mistaken , - you look incredulous . "
176581	176589	176591	176591	Jessie	358	" It could not be the Squire , "
176593	176626	176591	176591	Jessie	358	" Miss Travers assured me that it was neither he nor herself . Oh , it must be you , sir . I beg pardon , but who else could it be ? "
176627	176694	176873	176873	Kenelm	261	" Your husband shall guess . Suppose , Will , that you had behaved ill to some one who was nevertheless dear to you , and on thinking over it afterwards felt very sorry and much ashamed of yourself , and suppose that later you had the opportunity and the power to render a service to that person , do you think you would do it ? "
176695	176707	176591	176591	Jessie	358	" I should be a bad man if I did not . "
176708	176843	176873	176873	Kenelm	261	" Bravo ! And supposing that when the person you thus served came to know it was you who rendered the service , he did not feel thankful , he did not think it handsome of you , thus to repair any little harm he might have done you before , but became churlish and sore and cross - grained , and with a wretched false pride said that because he had offended you once he resented your taking the liberty of befriending him now , would you not think that person an ungrateful fellow ; ungrateful not only to you his fellow - man , - that is of less moment , - but ungrateful to the God who put it into your heart to be His human agent in the benefit received ? "
176844	176853	176855	176855	Will	362	" Well , sir , yes , certainly , "
176906	176926	176882	176882	her	358	" Oh , Mr. Chillingly , I hope you are not thinking , not speaking , of Mr. Bowles ? "
176927	176937	176938	176938	Will	362	" Whom else should I think or speak of ? "
176950	176967	176938	176938	Will	362	" Sir , sir , this is a bitter blow , - very bitter , very . "
177010	177066	176985	176987	old Mrs. Somers	371	" My dear Mrs. Somers , what is the good of being a grandmother and knitting socks for baby grandchildren , if you can not assure those silly children of yours that they are too happy in each other to harbour any resentment against a man who would have parted them , and now repents ? "
177137	177170	177172	177172	she	4378	" If you do n't long to see Mr. Bowles again and say ' The Lord bless you , sir ! ' you do n't deserve the Lord 's blessing upon you . "
177184	177199	177201	177201	Will	362	" Thank Heaven , we have paid back the best part of the loan , "
177208	177238	177242	177242	he	362	" and I think , with a little pinching , Jessie , and with selling off some of the stock , we might pay the rest ; and then , "
177248	177256	177242	177242	he	362	" and then , sir , we will "
177260	177265	177242	177242	he	362	" thank Mr. Bowles . "
177266	177277	177279	177279	Kenelm	261	" This do n't satisfy me at all , Will , "
177281	177458	177279	177279	Kenelm	261	" and since I helped to bring you two together , I claim the right to say I would never have done so could I have guessed you could have trusted your wife so little as to allow a remembrance of Mr. Bowles to be a thought of pain . You did not feel humiliated when you imagined that it was to me you owed some moneys which you have been honestly paying off . Well , then , I will lend you whatever trifle remains to discharge your whole debts to Mr. Bowles , so that you may sooner be able to say to him , ' Thank you . ' But between you and me , Will , I think you will be a finer fellow and a manlier fellow if you decline to borrow that trifle of me ; if you feel you would rather say ' Thank you ' to Mr. Bowles , without the silly notion that when you have paid him his money you owe him nothing for his kindness . "
177468	177580	177464	177464	Kenelm	261	" I have received a letter from Mr. Bowles to - day . He has come into a fortune , and thinks of going abroad for a time ; but before he goes , he says he should like to shake hands with Will , and be assured by Jessie that all his old rudeness is forgiven . He had no notion that I should blab about the loan : he wished that to remain always a secret . But between friends there need be no secrets . What say you , Will ? As head of this household , shall Mr. Bowles be welcomed here as a friend or not ? "
177581	177585	177587	177589	old Mrs. Somers	371	" Kindly welcome , "
177597	177600	177602	177602	Will	362	" Sir , "
177608	177660	177602	177602	Will	362	" look here ; you have never been in love , I dare say . If you had , you would not be so hard on me . Mr. Bowles was in love with my wife there . Mr. Bowles is a very fine man , and I am a cripple . "
177661	177668	177670	177670	Jessie	358	" Oh , Will ! Will ! "
177672	177711	177670	177670	Jessie	358	" But I trust my wife with my whole heart and soul ; and , now that the first pang is over , Mr. Bowles shall be , as mother says , kindly welcome , - heartily welcome . "
177712	177739	177743	177743	Kenelm	261	" Shake hands . Now you speak like a man , Will . I hope to bring Bowles here to supper before many days are over . "
178128	178137	178125	178125	they	10004	" Mrs. Cameron was every inch a lady . "
178367	178372	178373	178373	She	206	" the Low Church . "
178396	178403	178386	178386	she	206	" Outlines of History and Geography , "
178622	178634	178635	178635	She	206	" That woman has had the best masters of her time . "
178802	178813	178903	178903	her	523	" But sha'n't I see Lily ? Where is she ? "
178814	178848	178899	178900	Mrs. Braefield	523	" I fear she has gone into the town . A poor little boy , who did our errands , has met with an accident , - fallen from a cherry - tree . "
178849	178855	178903	178903	her	523	" Which he was robbing ? "
178856	178859	178899	178900	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Probably . "
178860	178869	178903	178903	her	523	" And Lily has gone to lecture him ? "
178870	178898	178899	178900	Mrs. Braefield	523	" I do n't know as to that ; but he is much hurt , and Lily has gone to see what is the matter with him . "
178909	178960	178899	178900	Mrs. Braefield	523	" I do n't take much to girls of Lily 's age in general , though I am passionately fond of children . You know how I do take to Lily ; perhaps because she is so like a child . But she must be an anxious charge to you . "
178967	178987	178903	178903	her	523	" No ; she is still a child , a very good one ; why should I be anxious ? "
178994	179004	178988	178989	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Why , your child must now be eighteen . "
179009	179063	179005	179006	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Eighteen - is it possible ! How time flies ! though in a life so monotonous as mine , time does not seem to fly , it slips on like the lapse of water . Let me think , - eighteen ? No , she is but seventeen , - seventeen last May. "
179068	179089	179064	179065	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Seventeen ! A very anxious age for a girl ; an age in which dolls cease and lovers begin . "
179102	179129	179090	179091	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Lily never cared much for dolls , - never much for lifeless pets ; and as to lovers , she does not dream of them . "
179136	179178	179130	179131	Mrs. Braefield	523	" There is no age after six in which girls do not dream of lovers . And here another question arises . When a girl so lovely as Lily is eighteen next birthday , may not a lover dream of her ? "
179205	179221	179226	179226	herself	340	" As no lover has appeared , I can not trouble myself about his dreams . "
179228	179238	179226	179226	herself	340	" This is the stupidest woman I ever met ! "
179246	179265	179242	179243	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Do you not think that your neighbour , Mr. Chillingly , is a very fine young man ? "
179266	179281	179226	179226	herself	340	" I suppose he would be generally considered so . He is very tall . "
179282	179287	179242	179243	Mrs. Cameron	206	" A handsome face ? "
179288	179298	179226	179226	herself	340	" Handsome , is it ? I dare say . "
179299	179305	179242	179243	Mrs. Cameron	206	" What does Lily say ? "
179306	179310	179226	179226	herself	340	" About what ? "
179311	179323	179242	179243	Mrs. Cameron	206	" About Mr. Chillingly . Does she not think him handsome ? "
179324	179330	179226	179226	herself	340	" I never asked her . "
179331	179377	179242	179243	Mrs. Cameron	206	" My dear Mrs. Cameron , would it not be a very pretty match for Lily ? The Chillinglys are among the oldest families in Burke 's ' Landed Gentry , ' and I believe his father , Sir Peter , has a considerable property . "
179420	179453	179226	179226	herself	340	" It would be no friend to Lily who could put such notions into her head ; and there is no reason to suppose that they have entered into Mr. Chillingly 's . "
179454	179485	179242	179243	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Would you be sorry if they did ? Surely you would like your niece to marry well , and there are few chances of her doing so at Moleswich . "
179486	179544	179226	179226	herself	340	" Pardon me , Mrs. Braefield , but the question of Lily 's marriage I have never discussed , even with her guardian . Nor , considering the childlike nature of her tastes and habits , rather than the years she has numbered , can I think the time has yet come for discussing it at all . "
179598	179678	179572	179573	Mrs. Cameron	206	" My dear Mrs. Braefield , let me trust to your good sense and the affection with which you have honoured my niece not to incur the risk of unsettling her mind by a hint of the ambitious projects for her future on which you have spoken to me . It is extremely improbable that a young man of Mr. Chillingly 's expectations would entertain any serious thoughts of marrying out of his own sphere of life , and - "
179679	179754	179572	179573	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Stop , Mrs. Cameron , I must interrupt you . Lily 's personal attractions and grace of manner would adorn any station ; and have I not rightly understood you to say that though her guardian , Mr. Melville , is , as we all know , a man who has risen above the rank of his parents , your niece , Miss Mordaunt , is like yourself , by birth a gentlewoman ? "
179755	179763	179765	179766	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Yes , by birth a gentlewoman , "
179792	179949	179777	179777	she	206	" What does that matter ? A girl without fortune , without connection , brought up in this little cottage , the ward of a professional artist , who was the son of a city clerk , to whom she owes even the home she has found , is not in the same sphere of life as Mr. Chillingly , and his parents could not approve of such an alliance for him . It would be most cruel to her , if you were to change the innocent pleasure she may take in the conversation of a clever and well - informed stranger into the troubled interest which , since you remind me of her age , a girl even so childlike and beautiful as Lily might conceive in one represented to her as the possible partner of her life . Do n't commit that cruelty ; do n't - do n't , I implore you ! "
179950	179954	179960	179960	Elsie	340	" Trust me , "
179969	180149	179960	179960	Elsie	340	" What you say so sensibly , so nobly , never struck me before . I do not know much of the world , - knew nothing of it till I married , - and being very fond of Lily , and having a strong regard for Mr. Chillingly , I fancied I could not serve both better than - than - but I see now ; he is very young , very peculiar ; his parents might object , not to Lily herself , but to the circumstances you name . And you would not wish her to enter any family where she was not as cordially welcomed as she deserves to be . I am glad to have had this talk with you . Happily , I have done no mischief as yet . I will do none . I had come to propose an excursion to the remains of the Roman Villa , some miles off , and to invite you and Mr. Chillingly . I will no longer try to bring him and Lily together . "
180150	180239	179777	179777	she	206	" Thank you . But you still misconstrue me . I do not think that Lily cares half so much for Mr. Chillingly as she does for a new butterfly . I do not fear their coming together , as you call it , in the light in which she now regards him , and in which , from all I observe , he regards her . My only fear is that a hint might lead her to regard him in another way , and that way impossible . "
180265	180269	180253	180254	Mrs. Cameron	206	" brought together . "
180380	180390	180392	180392	Kenelm	261	" You come here too often , Miss Mordaunt , "
180435	180466	180403	180403	her	526	" Not too often . I promised to come as often as I could ; and , as I told you before , I have never broken a promise yet . "
180497	180500	180501	180501	she	1594	" See , "
180509	180543	180544	180544	she	1594	" I have put fresh flowers there . Since the day we met in this churchyard , I have thought so much of that tomb , so neglected , so forgotten , and - "
180554	180587	180544	180544	she	1594	" do you not often find that you are much too - what is the word ? ah ! too egotistical , considering and pondering and dreaming greatly too much about yourself ? "
180588	180611	180544	180544	she	1594	" Yes , you are right there ; though , till you so accused me , my conscience did not detect it . "
180612	180730	180544	180544	she	1594	" And do n't you find that you escape from being so haunted by the thought of yourself , when you think of the dead ? they can never have any share in your existence here . When you say , ' I shall do this or that to - day ; ' when you dream , ' I may be this or that to - morrow , ' you are thinking and dreaming , all by yourself , for yourself . But you are out of yourself , beyond yourself , when you think and dream of the dead , who can have nothing to do with your to - day or your to - morrow . "
180793	180892	180772	180772	he	261	" The dead are the past ; and with the past rests all in the present or the future that can take us out of our natural selves . The past decides our present . By the past we divine our future . History , poetry , science , the welfare of states , the advancement of individuals , are all connected with tombstones of which inscriptions are effaced . You are right to honour the mouldered tombstones with fresh flowers . It is only in the companionship of the dead that one ceases to be an egotist . "
180932	180963	180928	180928	she	526	" If I knew you better , I think I could understand you better . I wish you knew Lion . I should like to hear you talk with him . "
180991	181004	180987	180987	Lily	526	" Yes , I should like to hear you talk with Lion . "
181005	181014	180928	180928	she	526	" You mean your guardian , Mr. Melville ? "
181015	181022	180987	180987	Lily	526	" Yes , you know that . "
181023	181036	180928	180928	she	526	" And why should you like to hear me talk to him ? "
181037	181072	180987	180987	Lily	526	" Because there are some things in which I doubt if he was altogether right , and I would ask you to express my doubts to him ; you would , would you not ? "
181073	181092	180928	180928	she	526	" But why can you not express them yourself to your guardian ; are you afraid of him ? "
181093	181149	180987	180987	Lily	526	" Afraid , no indeed ! But - ah , how many people there are coming this way ! There is some tiresome public meeting in the town to - day . Let us take the ferry : the other side of the stream is much pleasanter ; we shall have it more to ourselves . "
181280	181291	181271	181271	Lily	526	" So , Brown , the cow has quite recovered . "
181292	181317	181271	181271	Lily	526	" Yes , Miss , thanks to you , and God bless you . To think of your beating the old witch like that ! "
181318	181347	181271	181271	Lily	526	" ' Tis not I who beat the witch , Brown ; ' tis the fairy . Fairies , you know , are much more powerful than witches . "
181348	181354	181271	181271	Lily	526	" So I find , Miss. "
181361	181392	181355	181355	Lily	526	" Mr. Brown has a very nice milch - cow that was suddenly taken very ill , and both he and his wife were convinced that the cow was bewitched . "
181393	181437	181271	181271	Lily	526	" Of course it were , that stands to reason . Did not Mother Wright tell my old woman that she would repent of selling milk , and abuse her dreadful ; and was not the cow taken with shivers that very night ? "
181438	181464	181355	181355	Lily	526	" Gently , Brown . Mother Wright did not say that your wife would repent of selling milk , but of putting water into it . "
181465	181497	181271	181271	Lily	526	" And how did she know that , if she was not a witch ? We have the best of customers among the gentlefolks , and never any one that complained . "
181498	181501	181503	181503	Lily	526	" And , "
181520	181613	181614	181614	she	4436	" Brown had a horrid notion of enticing Mother Wright into his ferry - boat and throwing her into the water , in order to break the spell upon the cow . But I consulted the fairies , and gave him a fairy charm to tie round the cow 's neck . And the cow is quite well now , you see . So , Brown , there was no necessity to throw Mother Wright into the water , because she said you put some of it into the milk . But , "
181643	181643	181614	181614	she	4436	"
181644	181648	181614	181614	she	4436	" Do , Miss. "
181649	181712	181614	181614	she	4436	" It was this : If Brown 's cow yields milk without any water in it , and if water gets into it when the milk is sold , we , the fairies , will pinch Mr. Brown black and blue ; and when Brown has his next fit of rheumatics he must not look to the fairies to charm it away . "
181733	181756	181758	181758	Kenelm	261	" You have quite converted him , not only as to the existence , but as to the beneficial power of fairies , "
181760	181763	181765	181765	Lily	526	" Ah , "
181769	181816	181765	181765	Lily	526	" ah , but would it not be nice if there were fairies still ? good fairies , and one could get at them ? tell them all that troubles and puzzles us , and win from them charms against the witchcraft we practise on ourselves ? "
181817	181865	181866	181866	He	261	" I doubt if it would be good for us to rely on such supernatural counsellors . Our own souls are so boundless that the more we explore them the more we shall find worlds spreading upon worlds into infinities ; and among the worlds is Fairyland . "
181873	181881	181871	181871	himself	261	" Am I not in Fairyland now ? "
181882	181885	181887	181887	Lily	526	" Hush ! "
181889	181913	181887	181887	Lily	526	" Do n't speak more yet awhile . I am thinking over what you have just said , and trying to understand it . "
182059	182094	182159	182159	she	526	" You were to tell me your doubts in connection with your guardian , doubts if he were right in something which you left unexplained , which you could not yourself explain to him . "
182107	182157	182159	182159	she	526	" Yes , I can not mention my doubts to him because they relate to me , and he is so good . I owe him so much that I could not bear to vex him by a word that might seem like reproach or complaint . You remember , "
182227	182548	182221	182221	her	526	" you remember that I said in the burial - ground how much I felt that one is constantly thinking too much of one 's self . That must be wrong . In talking to you only about myself I know I am wrong , but I can not help it : I must do so . Do not think ill of me for it . You see I have not been brought up like other girls . Was my guardian right in that ? Perhaps if he had insisted upon not letting me have my own wilful way , if he had made me read the books which Mr. and Mrs. Emlyn wanted to force on me , instead of the poems and fairy tales which he gave me , I should have had so much more to think of that I should have thought less of myself . You said that the dead were the past ; one forgets one 's self when one thinks of the dead . If I had read more of the past , had more subjects of interest in the dead whose history it tells , surely I should be less shut up , as it were , in my own small , selfish heart ? It is only very lately I have thought of this , only very lately that I have felt sorrow and shame in the thought that I am so ignorant of what other girls know , even little Clemmy . And I dare not say this to Lion when I see him next , lest he should blame himself , when he only meant to be kind , and used to say , ' I do n't want Fairy to be learned , it is enough for me to think she is happy . ' And oh , I was so happy , till - till of late ! "
182549	182672	182210	182210	she	526	" Because till of late you only knew yourself as a child . But , now that you feel the desire of knowledge , childhood is vanishing . Do not vex yourself . With the mind which nature has bestowed on you , such learning as may fit you to converse with those dreaded ' grown - up folks ' will come to you very easily and quickly . You will acquire more in a month now than you would have acquired in a year when you were a child , and task - work was loathed , not courted . Your aunt is evidently well instructed , and if I might venture to talk to her about the choice of books - "
182673	182687	182221	182221	her	526	" No , do n't do that . Lion would not like it . "
182688	182705	182210	182210	she	526	" Your guardian would not like you to have the education common to other young ladies ? "
182706	182829	182221	182221	her	526	" Lion forbade my aunt to teach me much that I rather wished to learn . She wanted to do so , but she has given it up at his wish . She only now teases me with those horrid French verbs , and that I know is a mere make - belief . Of course on Sunday it is different ; then I must not read anything but the Bible and sermons . I do n't care so much for the sermons as I ought , but I could read the Bible all day , every week - day as well as Sunday ; and it is from the Bible that I learn that I ought to think less about myself . "
182844	182858	182860	182860	Lily	526	" Do you know the difference between one kind of poetry and another ? "
182864	182913	182210	182210	she	526	" I am not sure . I ought to know when one kind is good and another kind is bad . But in that respect I find many people , especially professed critics , who prefer the poetry which I call bad to the poetry I think good . "
182914	182932	182934	182934	Lily	526	" The difference between one kind of poetry and another , supposing them both to be good , "
182945	183094	182934	182934	Lily	526	" is this , - I know , for Lion explained it to me , - in one kind of poetry the writer throws himself entirely out of his existence , he puts himself into other existences quite strange to his own . He may be a very good man , and he writes his best poetry about very wicked men : he would not hurt a fly , but he delights in describing murderers . But in the other kind of poetry the writer does not put himself into other existences , he expresses his own joys and sorrows , his own individual heart and mind . If he could not hurt a fly , he certainly could not make himself at home in the cruel heart of a murderer . There , Mr. Chillingly , that is the difference between one kind of poetry and another . "
183095	183099	183101	183101	Kenelm	261	" Very true , "
183111	183141	183101	183101	Kenelm	261	" The difference between dramatic poetry and lyrical . But may I ask what that definition has to do with the subject into which you so suddenly introduced it ? "
183142	183284	182934	182934	Lily	526	" Much ; for when Lion was explaining this to my aunt , he said , ' A perfect woman is a poem ; but she can never be a poem of the one kind , never can make herself at home in the hearts with which she has no connection , never feel any sympathy with crime and evil ; she must be a poem of the other kind , weaving out poetry from her own thoughts and fancies . ' And , turning to me , he said , smiling , ' That is the poem I wish Lily to be . Too many dry books would only spoil the poem . ' And you now see why I am so ignorant , and so unlike other girls , and why Mr. and Mrs. Emlyn look down upon me . "
183285	183311	183101	183101	Kenelm	261	" You wrong at least Mr. Emlyn , for it was he who first said to me , ' Lily Mordaunt is a poem . ' "
183312	183329	182934	182934	Lily	526	" Did he ? I shall love him for that . How pleased Lion will be ! "
183330	183343	183345	183345	Kenelm	261	" Mr. Melville seems to have an extraordinary influence over your mind , "
183352	183445	182934	182934	Lily	526	" Of course . I have neither father nor mother : Lion has been both to me . Aunty has often said , ' You can not be too grateful to your guardian ; without him I should have no home to shelter you , no bread to give you . ' He never said that : he would be very angry with aunty if he knew she had said it . When he does not call me Fairy he calls me Princess . I would not displease him for the world . "
183446	183465	183486	183486	Kenelm	261	" He is very much older than you ; old enough to be your father , I hear . "
183466	183485	182934	182934	Lily	526	" I dare say . But if he were twice as old I could not love him better . "
183534	183554	183524	183524	Lily	526	" It is time to go home : aunty will be wondering what keeps me away , - come . "
183607	183619	183688	183688	Lily	526	" You have father and mother still living , Mr. Chillingly ? "
183620	183626	183688	183688	Lily	526	" Thank Heaven , yes . "
183627	183635	183688	183688	Lily	526	" Which do you love the best ? "
183636	183662	183688	183688	Lily	526	" That is scarcely a fair question . I love my mother very much ; but my father and I understand each other better than - "
183663	183680	183688	183688	Lily	526	" I see : it is so difficult to be understood . No one understands me . "
183681	183687	183688	183688	Lily	526	" I think I do . "
183699	183713	183690	183690	her	526	" At least as well as a man can understand a young lady . "
183714	183725	183688	183688	Lily	526	" What sort of young lady is Miss Cecilia Travers ? "
183726	183743	183690	183690	her	526	" Cecilia Travers ! When and how did you ever hear that such a person existed ? "
183744	183764	183688	183688	Lily	526	" That big London man whom they call Sir Thomas mentioned her name the day we dined at Braefieldville . "
183765	183778	183690	183690	her	526	" I remember , - as having been at the Court ball . "
183779	183787	183688	183688	Lily	526	" He said she was very handsome . "
183788	183793	183690	183690	her	526	" So she is . "
183794	183801	183688	183688	Lily	526	" Is she a poem too ? "
183802	183810	183690	183690	her	526	" No ; that never struck me . "
183811	183849	183688	183688	Lily	526	" Mr. Emlyn , I suppose , would call her perfectly brought up , - well educated . He would not raise his eyebrows at her as he does at me , - poor me , Cinderella ! "
183850	183886	183690	183690	her	526	" Ah , Miss Mordaunt , you need not envy her . Again let me say that you could very soon educate yourself to the level of any young ladies who adorn the Court balls . "
183887	183899	183901	183901	Lily	526	" Ay ; but then I should not be a poem , "
183931	183946	183927	183927	Lily	526	" You need not come any farther ; it is out of your way . "
183947	183971	183690	183690	her	526	" I can not be so disdainfully dismissed , Miss Mordaunt ; I insist on seeing you to at least your garden gate . "
183981	183999	183972	183972	Lily	526	" What sort of country do you live in when at home ; is it like this ? "
184000	184096	183927	183927	Lily	526	" Not so pretty ; the features are larger , more hill and dale and woodland : yet there is one feature in our grounds which reminds me a little of this landscape , - a light stream , somewhat wider , indeed , than your brooklet ; but here and there the banks are so like those by Cromwell Lodge that I sometimes start and fancy myself at home . I have a strange love for rivulets and all running waters , and in my foot wanderings I find myself magnetically attracted towards them . "
184116	184144	184097	184097	Lily	526	" Your home is much finer than any place here , even than Braefieldville , is it not ? Mrs. Braefield says your father is very rich . "
184145	184221	184097	184097	Lily	526	" I doubt if he is richer than Mr. Braefield ; and , though his house may be larger than Braefieldville , it is not so smartly furnished , and has no such luxurious hothouses and conservatories . My father 's tastes are like mine , very simple . Give him his library , and he would scarcely miss his fortune if he lost it . He has in this one immense advantage over me . "
184222	184228	184230	184230	Lily	526	" You would miss fortune ? "
184234	184268	184269	184269	They	4457	" Not that ; but my father is never tired of books . And shall I own it ? there are days when books tire me almost as much as they do you . "
184378	184381	184383	184383	Kenelm	261	" Only , "
184385	184411	184383	184383	Kenelm	261	" if you preserve the appetite I have lost , I fear you will find meagre fare to - day . Sit down , man . "
184412	184435	184436	184436	Kenelm	261	" Thank you , kindly , but I dined two hours ago in London , and I really can eat nothing more . "
184469	184534	184383	184383	Kenelm	261	" Your room is here , of course , Tom ; that was engaged from the day I asked you , but you ought to have given me a line to say when to expect you , so that I could have put our hostess on her mettle as to dinner or supper . You smoke still , of course : light your pipe . "
184535	184555	184557	184557	Tom	359	" Thank you , Mr. Chillingly , I seldom smoke now ; but if you will excuse a cigar , "
184566	184662	184383	184383	Kenelm	261	" Do as you would at home . I shall send word to Will Somers that you and I sup there to - morrow . You forgive me for letting out your secret . All straightforward now and henceforth . You come to their hearth as a friend , who will grow dearer to them both every year . Ah , Tom , this love for woman seems to me a very wonderful thing . It may sink a man into such deeps of evil , and lift a man into such heights of good . "
184663	184673	184675	184675	Tom	359	" I do n't know as to the good , "
184685	184707	184383	184383	Kenelm	261	" Go on smoking : I should like to keep you company ; can you spare me one of your cigars ? "
184742	184780	184729	184729	he	261	" You do n't know as to the good ; but tell me honestly , do you think if you had not loved Jessie Wiles , you would be as good a man as you are now ? "
184781	184801	184729	184729	he	261	" If I am better than I was , it is not because of my love for the girl . "
184802	184806	184729	184729	he	261	" What then ? "
184807	184813	184729	184729	he	261	" The loss of her . "
184847	185020	184843	184843	Tom	359	" Suppose I had won Jessie and married her , I do n't think any idea of improving myself would have entered my head . My uncle would have been very much offended at my marrying a day - labourer 's daughter , and would not have invited me to Luscombe . I should have remained at Graveleigh , with no ambition of being more than a common farrier , an ignorant , noisy , quarrelsome man ; and if I could not have made Jessie as fond of me as I wished , I should not have broken myself of drinking , and I shudder to think what a brute I might have been , when I see in the newspapers an account of some drunken wife - beater . How do we know but what that wife - beater loved his wife dearly before marriage , and she did not care for him ? His home was unhappy , and so he took to drink and to wife - beating . "
185021	185028	185030	185030	Kenelm	261	" I was right , then , "
185036	185077	185030	185030	Kenelm	261	" when I told you it would be a miserable fate to be married to a girl whom you loved to distraction , and whose heart you could never warm to you , whose life you could never render happy . "
185078	185082	184843	184843	Tom	359	" So right ! "
185083	185095	185097	185097	Kenelm	261	" Let us drop that part of the subject at present , "
185102	185189	185100	185100	himself	261	" and talk about your wish to travel . Though contented that you did not marry Jessie , though you can now , without anguish , greet her as the wife of another , still there are some lingering thoughts of her that make you restless ; and you feel that you could more easily wrench yourself from these thoughts in a marked change of scene and adventure , that you might bury them altogether in the soil of a strange land . Is it so ? "
185190	185199	184843	184843	Tom	359	" Ay , something of that , sir . "
185740	185752	185754	185754	she	3585	" I am heartily glad to see you , Mr. Bowles , "
185756	185781	185754	185754	she	3585	" and so all three of us are , and ought to be ; and if baby was older , there would be four . "
185782	185792	185794	185794	Kenelm	261	" And where on earth have you hidden baby ? "
185796	185846	185794	185794	Kenelm	261	" Surely he might have been kept up for me to - night , when I was expected ; the last time I supped here I took you by surprise , and therefore had no right to complain of baby 's want of respect to her parents ' friends . "
186068	186072	186073	186073	he	362	" Mr. Bowles , "
186078	186112	186073	186073	he	362	" you have a kind heart , and a good heart , and a generous heart . And your corning here to - night on this friendly visit is an honour which - which "
186114	186117	186119	186119	Kenelm	261	" Which , "
186126	186208	186119	186119	Kenelm	261	" is on the side of us single men . In this free country a married man who has a male baby may be father to the Lord Chancellor or the Archbishop of Canterbury . But - well , my friends , such a meeting as we have to - night does not come often ; and after supper let us celebrate it with a bowl of punch . If we have headaches the next morning none of us will grumble . "
186216	186238	186209	186211	Old Mrs. Somers	371	" Bless you , sir , I did not think of the punch ; I will go and see about it , "
186392	186472	186379	186379	Will	362	" You do n't want thanks , and I ca n't express them . But when we say our prayers at night , we have always asked God to bless him who brought us together , and has since made us so prosperous , - I mean Mr. Chillingly . To - night there will be another besides him , for whom we shall pray , and for whom baby , when he is older , will pray too . "
186566	186580	186552	186552	Tom	359	" I am very grateful to you for this evening , - very . "
186581	186590	186559	186559	his	359	" It has revived no painful thoughts then ? "
186591	186615	186552	186552	Tom	359	" No ; I feel so much calmer in mind than I ever believed I could have been , after seeing her again . "
186616	186621	186626	186626	himself	261	" Is it possible ! "
186628	186651	186626	186626	himself	261	" How should I feel if I ever saw in Lily the wife of another man , the mother of his child ? "
186923	186930	186932	186932	Kenelm	261	" You have just told me , "
186934	187098	186932	186932	Kenelm	261	" that you feel as if a load were taken off your heart , now that you have again met Jessie Somers , and that you find her so changed that she is no longer the woman you loved . As to the change , whatever it be , I own , it seems to me for the better , in person , in manners , in character ; of course I should not say this , if I were not convinced of your perfect sincerity when you assured me that you are cured of the old wound . But I feel so deeply interested in the question how a fervent love , once entertained and enthroned in the heart of a man so earnestly affectionate and so warm - blooded as yourself , can be , all of a sudden , at a single interview , expelled or transferred into the calm sentiment of friendship , that I pray you to explain . "
187099	187108	187110	187110	Tom	359	" That is what puzzles me , sir , "
187119	187130	187113	187113	his	359	" And I do n't know if I can explain it .
187131	187139	186932	186932	Kenelm	261	" Think over it , and try . "
187149	187194	187140	187140	Tom	359	" You see , sir , that I was a very different man myself when I fell in love with Jessie Wiles , and said , ' Come what may , that girl shall be my wife . Nobody else shall have her . ' "
187195	187201	187113	187113	his	359	" Agreed ; go on . "
187202	187258	187140	187140	Tom	359	" But while I was becoming a different man , when I thought of her - and I was always thinking of her - I still pictured her to myself as the same Jessie Wiles ; and though , when I did see her again at Graveleigh , after she had married - the day - "
187259	187270	187113	187113	his	359	" You saved her from the insolence of the Squire . "
187271	187618	187140	187140	Tom	359	" She was but very recently married . I did not realize her as married . I did not see her husband , and the difference within myself was only then beginning . Well , so all the time I was reading and thinking , and striving to improve my old self at Luscombe , still Jessie Wiles haunted me as the only girl I had ever loved , ever could love ; I could not believe it possible that I could ever marry any one else . And lately I have been much pressed to marry some one else ; all my family wish it : but the face of Jessie rose up before me , and I said to myself , ' I should be a base man if I married one woman , while I could not get another woman out of my head . ' I must see Jessie once more , must learn whether her face is now really the face that haunts me when I sit alone ; and I have seen her , and it is not that face : it may be handsomer , but it is not a girl 's face , it is the face of a wife and a mother . And , last evening , while she was talking with an open - heartedness which I had never found in her before , I became strangely conscious of the difference in myself that had been silently at work within the last two years or so . Then , sir , when I was but an ill - conditioned , uneducated , petty village farrier , there was no inequality between me and a peasant girl ; or , rather , in all things except fortune , the peasant girl was much above me . But last evening I asked myself , watching her and listening to her talk , ' If Jessie were now free , should I press her to be my wife ? ' and I answered myself , ' No . ' "
187632	187635	187619	187619	Kenelm	261	" Why ? "
187636	187721	187140	187140	Tom	359	" It seems as if I were giving myself airs to say why . But , sir , lately I have been thrown among persons , women as well as men , of a higher class than I was born in ; and in a wife I should want a companion up to their mark , and who would keep me up to mine ; and ah , sir , I do n't feel as if I could find that companion in Mrs. Somers . "
187722	187818	187619	187619	Kenelm	261	" I understand you now , Tom . But you are spoiling a silly romance of mine . I had fancied the little girl with the flower face would grow up to supply the loss of Jessie ; and , I am so ignorant of the human heart , I did think it would take all the years required for the little girl to open into a woman , before the loss of the old love could be supplied . I see now that the poor little child with the flower face has no chance . "
187819	187827	187829	187829	Tom	359	" Chance ? Why , Mr. Chillingly , "
187835	187890	187892	187892	Tom	359	" Susey is a dear little thing , but she is scarcely more than a mere charity girl . Sir , when I last saw you in London you touched on that matter as if I were still the village farrier 's son , who might marry a village labourer 's daughter . But , "
187902	187955	187892	187892	Tom	359	" even if Susey were a lady born I think a man would make a very great mistake , if he thought he could bring up a little girl to regard him as a father ; and then , when she grew up , expect her to accept him as a lover . "
187956	187963	187965	187965	Kenelm	261	" Ah , you think that ! "
187982	188032	187892	187892	Tom	359	" You think that ; it is very sensibly said , - well , and you have been pressed to marry , and have hung back till you had seen again Mrs. Somers . Now you will be better disposed to such a step ; tell me about it ? "
188033	188146	188147	188147	Tom	359	" I said , last evening , that one of the principal capitalists at Luscombe , the leading corn - merchant , had offered to take me into partnership . And , sir , he has an only daughter , she is a very amiable girl , has had a first - rate education , and has such pleasant manners and way of talk , quite a lady . If I married her I should soon be the first man in Luscombe , and Luscombe , as you are no doubt aware , returns two members to Parliament ; who knows , but that some day the farrier 's son might be - "
188173	188176	188178	188178	Kenelm	261	" Ah ! "
188183	188223	188178	188178	Kenelm	261	" is it so ? must each man in his life play many parts ? Ambition succeeds to love , the reasoning brain to the passionate heart . True , you are changed ; my Tom Bowles is gone . "
188224	188236	188238	188238	Tom	359	" Not gone in his undying gratitude to you , sir , "
188244	188356	188238	188238	Tom	359	" Your Tom Bowles would give up all his dreams of wealth or of rising in life , and go through fire and water to serve the friend who first bid him be a new Tom Bowles ! Do n't despise me as your own work : you said to me that terrible day , when madness was on my brow and crime within my heart , ' I will be to you the truest friend man ever found in man . ' So you have been . You commanded me to read ; you commanded me to think ; you taught me that body should be the servant of mind . "
188357	188464	188503	188503	he	359	" Hush , hush , times are altered ; it is you who can teach me now . Teach me , teach me ; how does ambition replace love ? How does the desire to rise in life become the all - mastering passion , and , should it prosper , the all - atoning consolation of our life ? We can never be as happy , though we rose to the throne of the Caesars , as we dream that we could have been , had Heaven but permitted us to dwell in the obscurest village , side by side with the woman we love . "
188515	188803	188503	188503	he	359	" I ca n't pretend to say what maybe the case with others . But to judge by my own case , it seems to me this : a young man who , out of his own business , has nothing to interest or excite him , finds content , interest , and excitement when he falls in love ; and then , whether for good or ill , he thinks there is nothing like love in the world , he do n't care a fig for ambition then . Over and over again did my poor uncle ask me to come to him at Luscombe , and represent all the worldly advantage it would be to me ; but I could not leave the village in which Jessie lived , and , besides , I felt myself unfit to be anything higher than I was . But when I had been some time at Luscombe , and gradually got accustomed to another sort of people , and another sort of talk , then I began to feel interest in the same objects that interested those about me ; and when , partly by mixing with better educated men , and partly by the pains I took to educate myself , I felt that I might now more easily rise above my uncle 's rank of life than two years ago I could have risen above a farrier 's forge , then the ambition to rise did stir in me , and grew stronger every day . Sir , I do n't think you can wake up a man 's intellect but what you wake with it emulation . And , after all , emulation is ambition . "
188804	188824	189146	189146	Tom	359	" Then , I suppose , I have no emulation in me , for certainly I have no ambition . "
188825	188913	188503	188503	he	359	" That I ca n't believe , sir ; other thoughts may cover it over and keep it down for a time . But sooner or later , it will force its way to the top , as it has done with me . To get on in life , to be respected by those who know you , more and more as you grow older , I call that a manly desire . I am sure it comes as naturally to an Englishman as - as - "
188914	188956	189146	189146	Tom	359	" As the wish to knock down some other Englishman who stands in his way does . I perceive now that you were always a very ambitious man , Tom ; the ambition has only taken another direction . Caesar might have been
188957	188967	188503	188503	he	359	" ' But the first wrestler on the green . '
188968	189026	189146	189146	Tom	359	" And now , I suppose , you abandon the idea of travel : you will return to Luscombe , cured of all regret for the loss of Jessie ; you will marry the young lady you mention , and rise , through progressive steps of alderman and mayor , into the rank of member for Luscombe . "
189027	189036	189038	189038	Tom	359	" All that may come in good time , "
189052	189106	189038	189038	Tom	359	" but I still intend to travel : a year so spent must render me all the more fit for any station I aim at . I shall go back to Luscombe to arrange my affairs , come to terms with Mr. Leland the corn - merchant , against my return , and - "
189107	189117	189146	189146	Tom	359	" The young lady is to wait till then . "
189118	189121	189038	189038	Tom	359	" Emily - "
189122	189140	189146	189146	Tom	359	" Oh , that is the name ? Emily ! a much more elegant name than Jessie . "
189141	189144	189146	189146	Tom	359	" Emily , "
189175	189213	189146	189146	Tom	359	" Emily knows that if she were my wife I should be proud of her , and will esteem me the more if she feels how resolved I am that she shall never be ashamed of me . "
189214	189220	189222	189222	Kenelm	261	" Pardon me , Tom , "
189238	189271	189227	189227	his	261	" Nature has made you a thorough gentleman ; and you could not think and speak more nobly if you had come into the world as the head of all the Howards . "
189292	189313	189282	189282	He	359	" I do n't wish the impression made on me the other evening to incur a chance of being weakened . "
189450	189459	189438	189438	Jessie	358	" La reine est morte : vive la reine "
189603	189613	189599	189599	she	523	" Yes , I called there the other day , "
189644	189679	189803	189803	she	340	" The other day you proposed an excursion to the site of the Roman villa , and said you would ask Mrs. Cameron to be of the party . Perhaps you have forgotten it ? "
189680	189702	189713	189713	Elsie	340	" No ; but Mrs. Cameron declines . We can ask the Emlyns instead . He will be an excellent cicerone . "
189703	189712	189803	189803	she	340	" Excellent ! Why did Mrs. Cameron decline ? "
189738	189800	189719	189719	her	340	" I can not say why Mrs. Cameron declined , but in declining she acted very wisely and very honourably . Listen to me , Mr. Chillingly . You know how highly I esteem , and how cordially I like you , and judging by what I felt for some weeks , perhaps longer , after we parted at Tor Hadham - "
189822	189862	189803	189803	she	340	" If I were Lily 's aunt or elder sister , I should do as Mrs. Cameron does ; decline to let Lily see much more of a young gentleman too much above her in wealth and station for - "
189863	189866	189868	189868	Kenelm	261	" Stop , "
189872	189895	189868	189868	Kenelm	261	" I can not allow that any man 's wealth or station would warrant his presumption in thinking himself above Miss Mordaunt . "
189896	189930	189803	189803	she	340	" Above her in natural grace and refinement , certainly not . But in the world there are other considerations which , perhaps , Sir Peter and Lady Chillingly might take into account . "
189931	189945	189868	189868	Kenelm	261	" You did not think of that before you last saw Mrs. Cameron . "
189946	189973	189803	189803	she	340	" Honestly speaking , I did not . Assured that Miss Mordaunt was a gentlewoman by birth , I did not sufficiently reflect upon other disparities . "
189974	189988	189868	189868	Kenelm	261	" You know , then , that she is by birth a gentlewoman ? "
189989	190150	189803	189803	she	340	" I only know it as all here do , by the assurance of Mrs. Cameron , whom no one could suppose not to be a lady . But there are different degrees of lady and of gentleman , which are little heeded in the ordinary intercourse of society , but become very perceptible in questions of matrimonial alliance ; and Mrs. Cameron herself says very plainly that she does not consider her niece to belong to that station in life from which Sir Peter and Lady Chillingly would naturally wish their son should select his bride . Then holding out her hand pardon me if I have wounded or offended you . I speak as a true friend to you and to Lily both . Earnestly I advise you , if Miss Mordaunt be the cause of your lingering here , earnestly I advise you to leave while yet in time for her peace of mind and your own . "
190151	190157	190159	190159	Kenelm	261	" Her peace of mind , "
190176	190203	190171	190172	Mrs. Braefield	523	" Her peace of mind ? Do you sincerely think that she cares for me , - could care for me , - if I stayed ? "
190204	190280	189803	189803	she	340	" I wish I could answer you decidedly . I am not in the secrets of her heart . I can but conjecture that it might be dangerous for the peace of any young girl to see too much of a man like yourself , to divine that he loved her , and not to be aware that he could not , with the approval of his family , ask her to become his wife . "
190317	190363	190304	190304	he	261	" You are right . Miss Mordaunt 's peace of mind must be the first consideration . Excuse me if I quit you thus abruptly . You have given me much to think of , and I can only think of it adequately when alone . "
190677	190689	190672	190672	I	0	" It is fate , it is nature , it is love "
191249	191255	191231	191231	her	4551	" It is thy work , "
191274	191291	191259	191259	you	4554	" Thou art in contact with the beloved in all that thou feelest elevated above thee . "
191962	191978	191958	191958	she	526	" I suppose because with them I feel safer , I mean nearer to God . "
192033	192410	192014	192014	he	4048	" Once on a time , a king and queen made themselves very unhappy because they had no heir to their throne ; and they prayed for one ; and lo , on some bright summer morning , the queen , waking from sleep , saw a cradle beside her bed , and in the cradle a beautiful sleeping babe . Great day throughout the kingdom ! But as the infant grew up , it became very wayward and fretful : it lost its beauty ; it would not learn its lessons ; it was as naughty as a child could be . The parents were very sorrowful ; the heir , so longed for , promised to be a great plague to themselves and their subjects . At last one day , to add to their trouble , two little bumps appeared on the prince 's shoulders . All the doctors were consulted as to the cause and the cure of this deformity . Of course they tried the effect of back - bands and steel machines , which gave the poor little prince great pain , and made him more unamiable than ever . The bumps , nevertheless , grew larger , and as they increased , so the prince sickened and pined away . At last a skilful surgeon proposed , as the only chance of saving the prince 's life , that the bumps should be cut out ; and the next morning was fixed for that operation . But at night the queen saw , or dreamed she saw , a beautiful shape standing by her bedside . And it said to her reproachfully , ' Ungrateful woman ! How wouldst thou repay me for the precious boon that my favour bestowed on thee ! In me behold the Queen of the Fairies . For the heir to thy kingdom , I consigned to thy charge an infant from Fairyland , to become a blessing to thee and to thy people ; and thou wouldst inflict upon it a death of torture by the surgeon 's knife . ' And the queen answered , ' Precious indeed thou mayest call the boon , - a miserable , sickly , feverish changeling . '
192411	192546	192723	192723	she	526	" ' Art thou so dull , ' said the beautiful visitant , ' as not to comprehend that the earliest instincts of the fairy child would be those of discontent , at the exile from its native home ? and in that discontent it would have pined itself to death , or grown up , soured and malignant , a fairy still in its power but a fairy of wrath and evil , had not the strength of its inborn nature sufficed to develop the growth of its wings . That which thy blindness condemns as the deformity of the human - born , is to the fairy - born the crowning perfection of its beauty . Woe to thee , if thou suffer not the wings of the fairy child to grow . '
192547	192695	192014	192014	he	4048	" And the next morning the queen sent away the surgeon when he came with his horrible knife , and removed the back - board and the steel machines from the prince 's shoulders , though all the doctors predicted that the child would die . And from that moment the royal heir began to recover bloom and health . And when at last , out of those deforming bumps , budded delicately forth the plumage of snow - white wings , the wayward peevishness of the prince gave place to sweet temper . Instead of scratching his teachers , he became the quickest and most docile of pupils , grew up to be the joy of his parents and the pride of their people ; and people said , ' In him we shall have hereafter such a king as we have never yet known . ' "
192734	192830	192723	192723	she	526	" But you do not seem to know what happened afterwards . Do you suppose that the prince never made use of his wings ? Listen to me . It was discovered by the courtiers who attended on His Royal Highness that on certain nights , every week , he disappeared . In fact , on these nights , obedient to the instinct of the wings , he flew from palace halls into Fairyland ; coming back thence all the more lovingly disposed towards the human home from which he had escaped for a while . "
192831	192837	192839	192840	the preacher	4597	" Oh , my children , "
192843	192915	192839	192840	the preacher	4597	" the wings would be given to us in vain if we did not obey the instinct which allures us to soar ; vain , no less , would be the soaring , were it not towards the home whence we came , bearing back from its native airs a stronger health , and a serener joy ; more reconciled to the duties of earth by every new flight into heaven . "
193006	193021	192991	192991	Lily	526	" Are you angry with me ? what have I done to displease you ? "
193022	193038	192991	192991	Lily	526	" Angry with you ; displeased ? How can you think of me so unjustly ? "
193039	193056	193057	193057	she	526	" It is so many days since you have called , since I have seen you , "
193096	193101	193084	193085	her aunt	6488	" Good - night , "
193396	193409	193424	193424	she	927	" Oh , it is so pretty , Mrs. Somers ! but , "
193428	193447	193424	193424	she	927	" I ca n't buy it . I have not got enough , not by a great deal . "
193448	193457	193459	193459	Kenelm	261	" And what is it , Miss Clemmy ? "
193476	193480	193481	193481	she	927	" Look here , "
193484	193491	193481	193481	she	927	" is it not too lovely ? "
193513	193520	193522	193522	Jessie	358	" I assure you , miss , "
193535	193569	193522	193522	Jessie	358	" it is really a great bargain . Miss Mary Burrows , who was here just before you came , bought one not nearly so pretty and gave ten shillings more for it . "
193595	193599	193601	193601	Clemmy	530	" Miss Burrows ! "
193695	193726	193727	193727	She	371	" The ring fits you so nicely , Miss Mordaunt , and every young lady of your age wears at least one ring ; allow me to put it up . "
193734	193763	193727	193727	She	371	" Though we only sell the articles in this case on commission , it is all the same to us whether we are paid now or at Christmas . "
193764	193775	193777	193777	Lily	526	" ' Tis no use tempting me , Mrs. Somers , "
193788	193809	193777	193777	Lily	526	" I promised Lion , I mean my guardian , never to run into debt , and I never will . "
193938	193997	193935	193935	Jessie	358	" Miss Mordaunt took a great fancy to this ring , Mr. Chillingly . I am sure her aunt would like her to have it . I have a great mind to put it by on the chance of Mrs. Cameron 's calling here . It would be a pity if it were bought by some one else . "
193998	194002	194004	194004	Kenelm	261	" I think , "
194006	194039	194040	194040	He	261	" that I will take the liberty of showing it to Mrs. Cameron . No doubt she will buy it for her niece . Add the price of it to my bill . "
194175	194185	194187	194187	she	530	" You have a good heart , Mr. Chillingly , "
194192	194207	194187	194187	she	530	" How it must please you to give such pleasure ! Dear little Clemmy ! "
194243	194251	194253	194253	he	261	" If it pleases to give pleasure , "
194255	194273	194253	194253	he	261	" it is your turn to be pleased now ; you can confer such pleasure upon me . "
194274	194277	194278	194278	she	530	" How ? "
194290	194304	194306	194306	he	261	" By conceding to me the same right your little friend has allowed . "
194344	194348	194350	194350	Kenelm	261	" Miss Mordaunt , "
194364	194389	194353	194353	his	261	" But , oh ! in this ring it is my love that I offer , - it is my troth that I pledge ! "
194390	194501	194353	194353	his	261	" Miss Mordaunt , spare me the misery of thinking that I have offended you ; least of all would I do so on this day , for it may be some little while before I see you again . I am going home for a few days upon a matter which may affect the happiness of my life , and on which I should be a bad son and an unworthy gentleman if I did not consult him who , in all that concerns my affections , has trained me to turn to him , the father ; in all that concerns my honour to him , the gentleman .

194721	194725	194771	194772	Mrs. Cameron	206	" I love . "
194864	194872	194873	194873	she	206	" I am sure , Mr. Chillingly , "
194876	195090	194873	194873	she	206	" that you will not impute to my words any meaning more grave than that which I wish them to convey , when I remind you that there is no place too obscure to escape from the ill - nature of gossip , and you must own that my niece incurs the chance of its notice if she be seen walking alone in these by - paths with a man of your age and position , and whose sojourn in the neighbourhood , without any ostensible object or motive , has already begun to excite conjecture . I do not for a moment assume that you regard my niece in any other light than that of an artless child , whose originality of tastes or fancy may serve to amuse you ; and still less do I suppose that she is in danger of misrepresenting any attentions on your part . But for her sake I am bound to consider what others may say . Excuse me , then , if I add that I think you are also bound in honour and in good feeling to do the same . Mr. Chillingly , it would give me a great sense of relief if it suited your plans to move from the neighbourhood . "
195091	195097	195099	195099	Kenelm	261	" My dear Mrs. Cameron , "
195113	195176	195099	195099	Kenelm	261	" I thank you much for your candour , and I am glad to have this opportunity of informing you that I am about to move from this neighbourhood , with the hope of returning to it in a very few days and rectifying your mistake as to the point of view in which I regard your niece . In a word , "
195194	195244	195187	195187	his	261	" it is the dearest wish of my heart to be empowered by my parents to assure you of the warmth with which they will welcome your niece as their daughter , should she deign to listen to my suit and intrust me with the charge of her happiness . "
195261	195267	195268	195268	she	206	" No ! Mr. Chillingly , "
195271	195319	195268	195268	she	206	" this must not be , - can not be . Put out of your mind an idea so wild . A young man 's senseless romance . Your parents can not consent to your union with my niece ; I tell you beforehand they can not . "
195320	195324	195326	195326	Kenelm	261	" But why ? "
195346	195349	195350	195350	she	206	" Why ? "
195365	195518	195350	195350	she	206	" The why is easily explained . Mr. Kenelm Chillingly is the heir of a very ancient house and , I am told , of considerable estates . Lily Mordaunt is a nobody , an orphan , without fortune , without connection , the ward of a humbly born artist , to whom she owes the roof that shelters her ; she is without the ordinary education of a gentlewoman ; she has seen nothing of the world in which you move . Your parents have not the right to allow a son so young as yourself to throw himself out of his proper sphere by a rash and imprudent alliance . And , never would I consent , never would Walter Melville consent , to her entering into any family reluctant to receive her . There , - that is enough . Dismiss the notion so lightly entertained . And farewell . "
195519	195522	195524	195524	Kenelm	261	" Madam , "
195528	195894	195524	195524	Kenelm	261	" believe me , that had I not entertained the hope approaching to conviction that the reasons you urge against my presumption will not have the weight with my parents which you ascribe to them , I should not have spoken to you thus frankly . Young though I be , still I might fairly claim the right to choose for myself in marriage . But I gave to my father a very binding promise that I would not formally propose to any one till I had acquainted him with my desire to do so , and obtained his approval of my choice ; and he is the last man in the world who would withhold that approval where my heart is set on it as it is now . I want no fortune with a wife , and should I ever care to advance my position in the world , no connection would help me like the approving smile of the woman I love . There is but one qualification which my parents would deem they had the right to exact from my choice of one who is to bear our name . I mean that she should have the appearance , the manners , the principles , and - my mother at least might add - the birth of a gentlewoman . Well , as to appearance and manners , I have seen much of fine society from my boyhood , and found no one among the highest born who can excel the exquisite refinement of every look , and the inborn delicacy of every thought , in her of whom , if mine , I shall be as proud as I shall be fond . As to defects in the frippery and tinsel of a boarding - school education , they are very soon remedied . Remains only the last consideration , - birth . Mrs. Braefield informs me that you have assured her that , though circumstances into which as yet I have no right to inquire , have made her the ward of a man of humble origin , Miss Mordaunt is of gentle birth . Do you deny that ? "
195895	195898	195900	195901	Mrs. Cameron	206	" No , "
195919	195953	195954	195954	she	206	" No . I can not deny that my niece is descended from those who , in point of birth , were not unequal to your own ancestors . But what of that ? "
195964	195981	195954	195954	she	206	" Equality of birth ceases when one falls into poverty , obscurity , neglect , nothingness ! "
195982	196162	195912	195912	her	206	" Really this is a morbid habit on your part . But , since we have thus spoken so confidentially , will you not empower me to answer the question which will probably be put to me , and the answer to which will , I doubt not , remove every obstacle in the way of my happiness ? Whatever the reasons which might very sufficiently induce you to preserve , whilst living so quietly in this place , a discreet silence as to the parentage of Miss Mordaunt and your own , - and I am well aware that those whom altered circumstances of fortune have compelled to altered modes of life may disdain to parade to strangers the pretensions to a higher station than that to which they reconcile their habits , - whatever , I say , such reasons for silence to strangers , should they preclude you from confiding to me , an aspirant to your niece 's hand , a secret which , after all , can not be concealed from her future husband ? "
196163	196173	196175	196176	Mrs. Cameron	206	" From her future husband ? of course not , "
196178	196310	196175	196176	Mrs. Cameron	206	" But I decline to be questioned by one whom I may never see again , and of whom I know so little . I decline , indeed , to assist in removing any obstacle to a union with my niece , which I hold to be in every way unsuited to either party . I have no cause even to believe that my niece would accept you if you were free to propose to her . You have not , I presume , spoken to her as an aspirant to her hand . You have not addressed to her any declaration of your attachment , or sought to extract from her inexperience any words that warrant you in thinking that her heart will break if she never sees you again . "
196311	196322	196324	196324	Kenelm	261	" I do not merit such cruel and taunting questions , "
196328	196353	196324	196324	Kenelm	261	" But I will say no more now . When we again meet let me hope you will treat me less unkindly . Adieu ! "
196354	196383	196175	196176	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Stay , sir . A word or two more . You persist in asking your father and Lady Chillingly to consent to your proposal to Miss Mordaunt ? "
196384	196389	196324	196324	Kenelm	261	" Certainly I do . "
196390	196458	196175	196176	Mrs. Cameron	206	" And you will promise me , on your word as a gentleman , to state fairly all the causes which might fairly operate against their consent , - the poverty , the humble rearing , the imperfect education of my niece , - so that they might not hereafter say you had entrapped their consent , and avenge themselves for your deceit by contempt for her ? "
196459	196496	196324	196324	Kenelm	261	" Ah , madam , madam , you really try my patience too far . But take my promise , if you can hold that of value from one whom you can suspect of deliberate deceit . "
196497	196591	196175	196176	Mrs. Cameron	206	" I beg your pardon , Mr. Chillingly . Bear with my rudeness . I have been so taken by surprise , I scarcely know what I am saying . But let us understand each other completely before we part . If your parents withhold their consent you will communicate it to me ; me only , not to Lily . I repeat I know nothing of the state of her affections . But it might embitter any girl 's life to be led on to love one whom she could not marry . "
196592	196606	196324	196324	Kenelm	261	" It shall be as you say . But if they do consent ? "
196607	196638	196175	196176	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Then you will speak to me before you seek an interview with Lily , for then comes another question : Will her guardian consent ? - and - and - "
196639	196643	196324	196324	Kenelm	261	" And what ? "
196644	196666	196175	196176	Mrs. Cameron	206	" No matter . I rely on your honour in this request , as in all else . Good - day . "
196678	196726	196676	196676	herself	4651	" But they will not consent . Heaven grant that they will not consent , or if they do , what - what is to be said or done ? Oh , that Walter Melville were here , or that I knew where to write to him ! "
196742	197023	196739	196740	the vicar	4048	" I was coming to you , my dear Mr. Chillingly , first to thank you for the very pretty present with which you have gladdened the heart of my little Clemmy , and next to ask you to come with me quietly to - day to meet Mr. - - - , the celebrated antiquarian , who came to Moleswich this morning at my request to examine that old Gothic tomb in our churchyard . Only think , though he can not read the inscription any better than we can , he knows all about its history . It seems that a young knight renowned for feats of valour in the reign of Henry IV . married a daughter of one of those great Earls of Montfichet who were then the most powerful family in these parts . He was slain in defending the church from an assault by some disorderly rioters of the Lollard faction ; he fell on the very spot where the tomb is now placed . That accounts for its situation in the churchyard , not within the fabric . Mr. - - - discovered this fact in an old memoir of the ancient and once famous family to which the young knight Albert belonged , and which came , alas ! to so shameful an end , the Fletwodes , Barons of Fletwode and Malpas . What a triumph over pretty Lily Mordaunt , who always chose to imagine that the tomb must be that of some heroine of her own romantic invention ! Do come to dinner ; Mr. - - - is a most agreeable man , and full of interesting anecdotes . "
197024	197103	196739	196740	the vicar	4048	" I am so sorry I can not . I am obliged to return home at once for a few days . That old family of Fletwode ! I think I see before me , while we speak , the gray tower in which they once held sway ; and the last of the race following Mammon along the Progress of the Age , - a convicted felon ! What a terrible satire on the pride of birth ! "
197812	197827	197808	197809	the Squire	6798	" You could do just as well with a third of those costly dependants , "
197844	197863	197828	197829	Sir Peter	421	" Very likely . But the question is , could the rest do just as well without me ? "
198277	198284	198449	198450	Leopold Travers	399	" Going too far for me . "
198311	198418	198301	198302	Chillingly Gordon	193	" Could I accept these doctrines ? I do n't see my way to being Prime Minister of a country in which religion and capital are still powers to be consulted . And , putting aside religion and capital , I do n't see how , if these doctrines passed into law , with a good coat on my back I should not be a sufferer . Either I , as having a good coat , should have it torn off my back as a capitalist , or , if I remonstrated in the name of moral honesty , be put to death as a religionist . "
198425	198433	198421	198422	Leopold Travers	399	" Of course we must go on , "
198440	198446	198434	198435	Chillingly Gordon	193	" Certainly , go on . "
198453	198461	198449	198450	Leopold Travers	399	" But we may go too far , "
198471	198481	198462	198463	Chillingly Gordon	193	" How true that is ! Certainly too far . "
198561	198567	198556	198556	he	399	" Gordon is a gentleman . "
198650	198656	198640	198640	he	193	" Hold up your cards . "
198709	198771	198704	198704	He	193	" Whatever she may give me in money , I shall amply repay in worldly position if I succeed , and succeed I certainly shall . If I were as rich as Lord Westminster , and still cared about being Prime Minister , I should select her as the most fitting woman I have seen for a Prime Minister 's wife . "
199096	199097	199088	199088	she	396	" "
199120	199349	199103	199104	Mr. Gordon	193	" Such was her judgment upon the unavowed candidate to Cecilia 's hand ; and Mrs. Campion required no avowal to divine the candidature . Even Lady Glenalvon had begun to take friendly interest in the fortunes of this promising young man . Most women can sympathize with youthful ambition . He impressed her with a deep conviction of his abilities , and still more with respect for their concentration upon practical objects of power and renown . She too , like Mrs. Campion , began to draw comparisons unfavourable to Kenelm between the two cousins : the one seemed so slothfully determined to hide his candle under a bushel , the other so honestly disposed to set his light before men . She felt also annoyed and angry that Kenelm was thus absenting himself from the paternal home at the very time of her first visit to it , and when he had so felicitous an opportunity of seeing more of the girl in whom he knew that Lady Glenalvon deemed he might win , if he would properly woo , the wife that would best suit him . So that when one day Mrs. Campion , walking through the gardens alone with Lady Glenalvon while from the gardens into the park went Chillingly Gordon , arm - in - arm with Leopold Travers , abruptly asked , "
199413	199413	199409	199411	some silly earl	4752	"
199423	199426	199414	199415	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Yes . "
199433	199633	199430	199430	she	274	" There is a man with whom I did once think she would have been happier than with any other . One man who ought to be dearer to me than Mr. Gordon , for he saved the life of my son , and who , though perhaps less clever than Mr. Gordon , still has a great deal of talent within him , which might come forth and make him - what shall I say ? - a useful and distinguished member of society , if married to a girl so sure of raising any man she marries as Cecilia Travers . But if I am to renounce that hope , and look through the range of young men brought under my notice , I do n't know one , putting aside consideration of rank and fortune , I should prefer for a clever daughter who went heart and soul with the ambition of a clever man . But , Mrs. Campion , I have not yet quite renounced my hope ; and , unless I do , I yet think there is one man to whom I would rather give Cecilia , if she were my daughter . "
199754	199790	199749	199750	the Parson	908	" Yes , solid and sound as one of those tables you buy at a broker 's ; the thickness of the varnish hides the defects in the joints : the whole framework is rickety . "
199831	199834	199836	199837	Parson John	253	" Because , "
199839	199871	199836	199837	Parson John	253	" he has no love for man , and no reverence for God . And no character is sound and solid which enlarges its surface at the expense of its supports . "
199957	199962	199952	199952	Gordon	193	" to feel his way "
200343	200352	200357	200357	herself	4789	" that is what he ought to do , "
200557	200565	200567	200567	Cecilia	364	" No bad news , I hope , "
200571	200575	200577	200578	Sir Peter	421	" Bad news , "
200580	200598	200600	200600	he	421	" No , my dear , no ; a letter on business . It seems terribly long , "
200618	200618	200600	200600	he	421	"
200619	200635	200637	200638	Mr. Travers	393	" That slovenly farmer of yours , Mr. Nostock , has failed , I suppose , "
200652	200672	200637	200638	Mr. Travers	393	" I told you he would , - a fine farm too . Let me choose you another tenant . "
200683	200700	200637	200638	Mr. Travers	393	" Nostock will not fail . There have been six generations of Nostocks on the farm . "
200701	200707	200709	200709	Travers	393	" So I should guess , "
200713	200718	200720	200721	Sir Peter	421	" And - and , "
200723	200753	200720	200721	Sir Peter	421	" if the last of the race fails , he must lean upon me , and - if one of the two break down - it shall not be - "
200754	200776	200637	200638	Mr. Travers	393	" Shall not be that cross - cropping blockhead , my dear Sir Peter . This is carrying benevolence too far . "
200798	200800	200803	200803	he	193	" Times "
200970	200973	200974	200974	he	421	" But , "
200977	201016	200974	200974	he	421	" after all it is the boy 's happiness that must be consulted . If he will not be happy in my way , what right have I to say that he shall not be happy in his ? "
201134	201148	201122	201122	She	364	" Dear Sir Peter , what is it , - what is it ? "
201149	201157	201159	201160	Sir Peter	421	" Ah - ah , my dear , "
201177	201215	201159	201160	Sir Peter	421	" Do n't ask , - do n't talk of it ; ' tis but one of the disappointments that all of us must undergo , when we invest our hopes in the uncertain will of others . "
201250	201276	201233	201233	he	421	" Pretty one , how good you have been to me ! Heaven bless you . What a wife you will be to some man ! "
201378	201396	201370	201371	Sir Peter	421	" that he had heard from Kenelm to the effect that he might be down any day . "
201397	201404	201406	201407	Lady Chillingly	4809	" Quite time he should come , "
201409	201417	201406	201407	Lady Chillingly	4809	" Have you his letter about you ? "
201418	201437	201370	201371	Sir Peter	421	" No , my dear Caroline . Of course he sends you his kindest love , poor fellow . "
201438	201448	201406	201407	Lady Chillingly	4809	" Why poor fellow ? Has he been ill ? "
201449	201483	201370	201371	Sir Peter	421	" No ; but there seems to be something on his mind . If so we must do what we can to relieve it . He is the best of sons , Caroline . "
201484	201498	201500	201501	her Ladyship	858	" I am sure I have nothing to say against him , except , "
201505	201520	201500	201501	her Ladyship	858	" that I do wish he were a little more like other young men . "
201521	201531	201370	201371	Sir Peter	421	" Hum - like Chillingly Gordon , for instance ? "
201532	201568	201500	201501	her Ladyship	858	" Well , yes ; Mr. Gordon is a remarkably well - bred , sensible young man . How different from that disagreeable , bearish father of his , who went to law with you ! "
201569	201602	201370	201371	Sir Peter	421	" Very different indeed , but with just as much of the Chillingly blood in him . How the Chillinglys ever gave birth to a Kenelm is a question much more puzzling . "
201603	201623	201500	201501	her Ladyship	858	" Oh , my dear Sir Peter , do n't be metaphysical . You know how I hate puzzles . "
201624	201665	201370	201371	Sir Peter	421	" And yet , Caroline , I have to thank you for a puzzle which I can never interpret by my brain . There are a great many puzzles in human nature which can only be interpreted by the heart . "
201666	201670	201672	201673	Lady Chillingly	4812	" Very true , "
201675	201693	201672	201673	Lady Chillingly	4812	" I suppose Kenelm is to have his old room , just opposite to Mr. Gordon 's . "
201694	201721	201370	201371	Sir Peter	421	" Ay - ay , just opposite . Opposite they will be all their lives . Only think , Caroline , I have made a discovery ! "
201722	201748	201672	201673	Lady Chillingly	4812	" Dear me ! I hope not . Your discoveries are generally very expensive , and bring us in contact with such very odd people . "
201749	201941	201370	201371	Sir Peter	421	" This discovery shall not cost us a penny , and I do n't know any people so odd as not to comprehend it . Briefly it is this : To genius the first requisite is heart ; it is no requisite at all to talent . My dear Caroline , Gordon has as much talent as any young man I know , but he wants the first requisite of genius . I am not by any means sure that Kenelm has genius , but there is no doubt that he has the first requisite of genius , - heart . Heart is a very perplexing , wayward , irrational thing ; and that perhaps accounts for the general incapacity to comprehend genius , while any fool can comprehend talent . My dear Caroline , you know that it is very seldom , not more than once in three years , that I presume to have a will of my own against a will of yours ; but should there come a question in which our son 's heart is concerned , then speaking between ourselves my will must govern yours . "
201942	201952	201957	201957	herself	4813	" Sir Peter is growing more odd every day , "
201962	201979	201957	201957	herself	4813	" But he does not mean ill , and there are worse husbands in the world . "
202221	202268	202208	202209	that gentleman	1016	" You can not guess all that the realization of your good - wishes would be . Once in the House of Commons , and my motives for action are so strong that - do not think me very conceited if I count upon Parliamentary success . "
202269	202289	202470	202471	the man	5565	" My clear Gordon , I am as certain of your success as I am of my own existence . "
202290	202383	202208	202209	that gentleman	1016	" Should I succeed , - should the great prizes of public life be within my reach , - should I lift myself into a position that would warrant my presumption , do you think I could come to you and say , ' There is an object of ambition dearer to me than power and office , - the hope of attaining which was the strongest of all my motives of action ? And in that hope shall I also have the good - wishes of the father of Cecilia Travers ? "
202384	202465	202470	202471	the man	5565	" My dear fellow , give me your hand ; you speak manfully and candidly as a gentleman should speak . I answer in the same spirit . I do n't pretend to say that I have not entertained views for Cecilia which included hereditary rank and established fortune in a suitor to her hand , though I never should have made them imperative conditions . I am neither potentate nor parvenu enough for that ; and I can never forget "
202475	202600	202208	202209	that gentleman	1016	" that I myself married for love , and was so happy . How happy Heaven only knows ! Still , if you had thus spoken a few weeks ago , I should not have replied very favourably to your question . But now that I have seen so much of you , my answer is this : If you lose your election , - if you do n't come into Parliament at all , you have my good - wishes all the same . If you win my daughter 's heart , there is no man on whom I would more willingly bestow her hand . There she is , by herself too , in the garden . Go and talk to her . "
202652	202655	202656	202656	he	193	" Ah ! "
202659	202727	202656	202656	he	193	" I can not express my gratitude for words so generous , encouragement so cheering . But I have never yet dared to utter to Miss Travers a word that would prepare her even to harbour a thought of me as a suitor . And I scarcely think I should have the courage to go through this election with the grief of her rejection on my heart . "
202728	202750	202790	202790	his	193	" Well , go in and win the election first ; meanwhile , at all events , take leave of Cecilia . "
202858	202884	202849	202849	He	193	" I bear with me her good - wishes as well as yours . That is all . I leave myself in your kind hands . "
202960	202971	202973	202973	he	193	" I have never yet failed in what I desired , "
202977	202988	202973	202973	he	193	" because I have ever taken pains not to fail . "
203082	203085	203087	203088	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Where , "
203090	203118	203087	203088	Lady Glenalvon	274	" there is such a dearth of rising young men , that if he were only half as clever as he is he would be a gain . "
203119	203125	203127	203128	Sir Peter	421	" A gain to what ? "
203132	203149	203127	203128	Sir Peter	421	" To his country ? about which I do n't believe he cares a brass button . "
203168	203173	203175	203176	Lady Glenalvon	274	" For my part , "
203182	203261	203175	203176	Lady Glenalvon	274	" I think every able man in Parliament is a gain to the country ; and he may not serve his country less effectively because he does not boast of his love for it . The politicians I dread most are those so rampant in France nowadays , the bawling patriots . When Sir Robert Walpole said , ' All those men have their price , ' he pointed to the men who called themselves ' patriots . ' "
203262	203265	203267	203267	Travers	399	" Bravo ! "
203269	203294	203296	203296	Kenelm	261	" Sir Robert Walpole showed his love for his country by corrupting it . There are many ways besides bribing for corrupting a country , "
203476	203569	203457	203457	her	526	" It might have been worse , my dear boy . I began to be afraid that , in spite of the teachings of Mivers and Welby , it was ' The Miller 's Daughter , ' after all . But we still have a difficult task to persuade your poor mother . In covering your first flight from our roof I unluckily put into her head the notion of Lady Jane , a duke 's daughter , and the notion has never got out of it . That comes of fibbing . "
203570	203587	203589	203589	Kenelm	261	" I count on Lady Glenalvon 's influence on my mother in support of your own , "
203591	203707	203589	203589	Kenelm	261	" If so accepted an oracle in the great world pronounce in my favour , and promise to present my wife at Court and bring her into fashion , I think that my mother will consent to allow us to reset the old family diamonds for her next reappearance in London . And then , too , you can tell her that I will stand for the county . I will go into Parliament , and if I meet there our clever cousin , and find that he does not care a brass button for the country , take my word for it , I will lick him more easily than I licked Tom Bowles . "
203708	203743	203850	203851	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Tom Bowles ! who is he ? - ah ! I remember some letter of yours in which you spoke of a Bowles , whose favourite study was mankind , a moral philosopher . "
203744	203748	203750	203750	Kenelm	261	" Moral philosophers , "
203752	203811	203750	203750	Kenelm	261	" have so muddled their brains with the alcohol of new ideas that their moral legs have become shaky , and the humane would rather help them to bed than give them a licking . My Tom Bowles is a muscular Christian , who became no less muscular , but much more Christian , after he was licked . "
204051	204057	204035	204035	she	274	" thus throwing himself away . "
204358	204418	204354	204354	he	261	" You thanked me once for saving your son 's life : you said then that you could never repay me ; you can repay me tenfold . Could your son , who is now , we trust , in heaven , look down and judge between us , do you think he would approve you if you refuse ? "
204442	204472	204420	204421	Lady Glenalvon	274	" You triumph ; I will go to Lady Chillingly at once . Marry her whom you so love , on one condition : marry her from my house . "
204524	204618	204511	204511	herself	274	" So you are going to propose to Miss Mordaunt , the Warwickshire Mordaunts I suppose ? Lady Glenalvon says she is a very lovely girl , and will stay with her before the wedding . And as the young lady is an orphan Lady Glenalvon 's uncle the Duke , who is connected with the eldest branch of the Mordaunts , will give her away . It will be a very brilliant affair . I am sure I wish you happy ; it is time you should have sown your wild oats . "
204831	204853	204819	204819	her	274	" That man has so disappointed me : he is so unworthy of the happiness I had once hoped for him ! "
204854	204861	204863	204863	Cecilia	364	" Whom do you speak of ? "
204869	204919	204819	204819	her	274	" Kenelm Chillingly . It seems that he has conceived a fancy for some penniless girl whom he has met in his wanderings , has come here to get the consent of his parents to propose to her , has obtained their consent , and is gone to propose . "
204935	204960	204932	204932	she	364	" He is worthy of all happiness , and he would never make an unworthy choice . Heaven bless him - and - and - "
204966	204970	204932	204932	she	364	" his bride , "
204981	204990	204992	204993	Lady Glenalvon	274	" Cousin Gordon is worth ten of him , "
205086	205098	205076	205076	himself	261	" Wanders the hoary Thames along His silver - winding way . "
205645	205668	205676	205676	he	261	" Singing , singing , Lustily singing , Down the road , with his dogs before , Came the Ritter of Nierestein . "
205770	205785	205765	205765	his	261	" I hope you do n't share Max 's alarm at meeting me again ? "
205786	205798	205730	205731	The minstrel	2047	" Ah , my young philosopher , is it indeed you ? "
205799	205842	205765	205765	his	261	" If I am to be designated a philosopher it is certainly not I. And , honestly speaking , I am not the same . I , who spent that pleasant day with you among the fields round Luscombe two years ago - "
205843	205885	205730	205731	The minstrel	2047	" Or who advised me at Tor Hadham to string my lyre to the praise of a beefsteak . I , too , am not quite the same , - I , whose dog presented you with the begging - tray . "
205886	205896	205765	205765	his	261	" Yet you still go through the world singing . "
205897	205970	205974	205975	the minstrel	2047	" Even that vagrant singing time is pretty well over . But I disturbed you from your repose ; I would rather share it . You are probably not going my way , and as I am in no hurry , I should not like to lose the opportunity chance has so happily given me of renewing acquaintance with one who has often been present to my thoughts since we last met . "
206024	206027	205987	205987	his	2047	" manner . "
206220	206223	206225	206226	the minstrel	2047	" Yes , "
206235	206337	206225	206226	the minstrel	2047	" the last year of my vagrant holidays has come to its close . I recollect that the first day we met by the road - side fountain , I advised you to do like me , seek amusement and adventure as a foot - traveller . Now , seeing you , evidently a gentleman by education and birth , still a foot - traveller , I feel as if I ought to say , ' You have had enough of such experience : vagabond life has its perils as well as charms ; cease it , and settle down . ' "
206338	206345	206347	206347	Kenelm	261	" I think of doing so , "
206351	206363	206225	206226	the minstrel	2047	" In a profession ? - army , law , medicine ? "
206364	206367	206225	206226	the minstrel	2047	" No . "
206368	206410	206225	206226	the minstrel	2047	" Ah , in marriage then . Right ; give me your hand on that . So a petticoat indeed has at last found its charm for you in the actual world as well as on the canvas of a picture ? "
206411	206415	206417	206417	Kenelm	261	" I conclude , "
206428	206446	206417	206417	Kenelm	261	" I conclude from your remark that it is in marriage you are about to settle down . "
206447	206485	206225	206226	the minstrel	2047	" Ay , could I have done so before I should have been saved from many errors , and been many years nearer to the goal which dazzled my sight through the haze of my boyish dreams . "
206486	206496	206417	206417	Kenelm	261	" What is that goal , - the grave ? "
206497	206511	206225	206226	the minstrel	2047	" The grave ! That which allows of no grave , - fame . "
206512	206538	206417	206417	Kenelm	261	" I see - despite of what you just now said - you still mean to go through the world seeking a poet 's fame . "
206539	206547	206549	206550	the minstrel	2047	" Alas ! I resign that fancy , "
206558	206773	206549	206550	the minstrel	2047	" It was not indeed wholly , but in great part the hope of the poet 's fame that made me a truant in the way to that which destiny , and such few gifts as Nature conceded to me , marked out for my proper and only goal . But what a strange , delusive Will - o'-the - Wisp the love of verse - making is ! How rarely a man of good sense deceives himself as to other things for which he is fitted , in which he can succeed ; but let him once drink into his being the charm of verse - making , how the glamour of the charm bewitches his understanding ! how long it is before he can believe that the world will not take his word for it , when he cries out to sun , moon , and stars , ' I , too , am a poet . ' And with what agonies , as if at the wrench of soul from life , he resigns himself at last to the conviction that whether he or the world be right , it comes to the same thing . Who can plead his cause before a court that will not give him a hearing ? "
206921	207068	206919	206919	he	261	" According to my very scanty reading , you share the love of verse - making with men the most illustrious in careers which have achieved the goal of fame . It must , then , be a very noble love : Augustus , Pollio , Varius , Maecenas , - the greatest statesmen of their day , - they were verse - makers . Cardinal Richelieu was a verse - maker ; Walter Raleigh and Philip Sidney , Fox , Burke , Sheridan , Warren Hastings , Canning , even the grave William Pitt , - all were verse - makers . Verse - making did not retard - no doubt the qualities essential to verse - making accelerated - their race to the goal of fame . What great painters have been verse - makers ! Michael Angelo , Leonardo da Vinci , Salvator Rosa "
207097	207109	206919	206919	he	261	" What ! all those mighty painters were verse - makers ? "
207110	207503	206919	206919	he	261	" Verse - makers so good , especially Michael Angelo , - the greatest painter of all , - that they would have had the fame of poets , if , unfortunately for that goal of fame , their glory in the sister art of painting did not outshine it . But when you give to your gift of song the modest title of verse - making , permit me to observe that your gift is perfectly distinct from that of the verse - maker . Your gift , whatever it may be , could not exist without some sympathy with the non verse - making human heart . No doubt in your foot travels , you have acquired not only observant intimacy with external Nature in the shifting hues at each hour of a distant mountain , in the lengthening shadows which yon sunset casts on the waters at our feet , in the habits of the thrush dropped fearlessly close beside me , in that turf moistened by its neighbourhood to those dripping rushes , all of which I could describe no less accurately than you , - as a Peter Bell might describe them no less accurately than a William Wordsworth . But in such songs of yours as you have permitted me to hear , you seem to have escaped out of that elementary accidence of the poet 's art , and to touch , no matter how slightly , on the only lasting interest which the universal heart of man can have in the song of the poet ; namely , in the sound which the poet 's individual sympathy draws forth from the latent chords in that universal heart . As for what you call ' the world , ' what is it more than the fashion of the present day ? How far the judgment of that is worth a poet 's pain I ca n't pretend to say . But of one thing I am sure , that while I could as easily square the circle as compose a simple couplet addressed to the heart of a simple audience with sufficient felicity to decoy their praises into Max 's begging - tray , I could spin out by the yard the sort of verse - making which characterizes the fashion of the present day . "
207541	207576	206919	206919	he	261	" You say that you could spin out by the yard verses in the fashion of the present day . I wish you would give me a specimen of your skill in that handiwork . "
207577	207622	206919	206919	he	261	" Very well ; on one condition , that you will repay my trouble by a specimen of your own verses , not in the fashion of the present day , - something which I can construe . I defy you to construe mine . "
207623	207626	206919	206919	he	261	" Agreed . "
207627	207717	206919	206919	he	261	" Well , then , let us take it for granted that this is the Augustan age of English poetry , and that the English language is dead , like the Latin . Suppose I am writing for a prize - medal in English , as I wrote at college for a prize - medal in Latin : of course , I shall be successful in proportion as I introduce the verbal elegances peculiar to our Augustan age , and also catch the prevailing poetic characteristic of that classical epoch .
207718	207813	206919	206919	he	261	" Now I think that every observant critic will admit that the striking distinctions of the poetry most in the fashion of the present day , namely , of the Augustan age , are , - first , a selection of such verbal elegances as would have been most repulsive to the barbaric taste of the preceding century ; and , secondly , a very lofty disdain of all prosaic condescensions to common - sense , and an elaborate cultivation of that element of the sublime which Mr. Burke defines under the head of obscurity .
207814	207839	206919	206919	he	261	" These premises conceded , I will only ask you to choose the metre . Blank verse is very much in fashion just now . "
207840	207862	206919	206919	he	261	" Pooh ! blank verse indeed ! I am not going so to free your experiment from the difficulties of rhyme . "
207863	207871	207873	207873	Kenelm	261	" It is all one to me , "
207877	207886	207873	207873	Kenelm	261	" rhyme be it : heroic or lyrical ? "
207887	207929	206919	206919	he	261	" Heroics are old - fashioned ; but the Chaucer couplet , as brought to perfection by our modern poets , I think the best adapted to dainty leaves and uncrackable nuts . I accept the modern Chaucerian . The subject ? "
207930	207985	207873	207873	Kenelm	261	" Oh , never trouble yourself about that . By whatever title your Augustan verse - maker labels his poem , his genius , like Pindar 's , disdains to be cramped by the subject . Listen , and do n't suffer Max to howl , if he can help it . Here goes . "
207999	208173	206919	206919	he	261	" In Attica the gentle Pythias dwelt . Youthful he was , and passing rich : he felt As if nor youth nor riches could suffice For bliss . Dark - eyed Sophronia was a nice Girl : and one summer day , when Neptune drove His sea - car slowly , and the olive grove That skirts Ilissus , to thy shell , Harmonia , Rippled , he said ' I love thee ' to Sophronia . Crocus and iris , when they heard him , wagged Their pretty heads in glee : the honey - bagged Bees became altars : and the forest dove Her plumage smoothed . Such is the charm of love . Of this sweet story do ye long for more ? Wait till I publish it in volumes four ; Which certain critics , my good friends , will cry Up beyond Chaucer . Take their word for ' t. I Say ' Trust them , but not read , - or you 'll not buy . ' "
208174	208182	208184	208185	the minstrel	2047	" You have certainly kept your word , "
208189	208215	208184	208185	the minstrel	2047	" and if this be the Augustan age , and the English were a dead language , you deserve to win the prize - medal . "
208216	208221	208223	208223	Kenelm	261	" You flatter me , "
208227	208337	208223	208223	Kenelm	261	" But if I , who never before strung two rhymes together , can improvise so readily in the style of the present day , why should not a practical rhymester like yourself dash off at a sitting a volume or so in the same style ; disguising completely the verbal elegances borrowed , adding to the delicacies of the rhyme by the frequent introduction of a line that will not scan , and towering yet more into the sublime by becoming yet more unintelligible ? Do that , and I promise you the most glowing panegyric in ' The Londoner , ' for I will write it myself . "
208338	208344	208346	208347	the minstrel	2047	" ' The Londoner ' ! "
208359	208366	208346	208347	the minstrel	2047	" my bitter , relentless enemy . "
208367	208522	208223	208223	Kenelm	261	" I fear , then , you have as little studied the critical press of the Augustan age as you have imbued your muse with the classical spirit of its verse . For the art of writing a man must cultivate himself . The art of being reviewed consists in cultivating the acquaintance of reviewers . In the Augustan age criticism is cliquism . Belong to a clique and you are Horace or Tibullus . Belong to no clique and , of course , you are Bavius or Maevius . ' The Londoner ' is the enemy of no man : it holds all men in equal contempt . But as , in order to amuse , it must abuse , it compensates the praise it is compelled to bestow upon the members of its clique by heaping additional scorn upon all who are cliqueless . Hit him hard : he has no friends . "
208523	208526	208528	208529	the minstrel	2047	" Ah , "
208531	208643	208528	208529	the minstrel	2047	" I believe that there is much truth in what you say . I never had a friend among the cliques . And Heaven knows with what pertinacity those from whom I , in utter ignorance of the rules which govern so - called organs of opinion , had hoped , in my time of struggle , for a little sympathy , a kindly encouragement , have combined to crush me down . They succeeded long . But at last I venture to hope that I am beating them . Happily , Nature endowed me with a sanguine , joyous , elastic temperament . He who never despairs seldom completely fails . "
208816	208820	208822	208822	he	261	" Our talk , "
208824	208897	208822	208822	he	261	" has digressed into fretful courses ; permit me to return to the starting - point . You are going to settle down into the peace of home . A peaceful home is like a good conscience . The rains without do not pierce its roof , the winds without do not shake its walls . If not an impertinent question , is it long since you have known your intended bride ? "
208898	208904	209343	209344	The minstrel	2047	" Yes , very long . "
208905	208911	208822	208822	he	261	" And always loved her ? "
208912	209063	209343	209344	The minstrel	2047	" Always , from her infancy . Out of all womankind , she was designed to be my life 's playmate and my soul 's purifier . I know not what might have become of me , if the thought of her had not walked beside me as my guardian angel . For , like many vagrants from the beaten high roads of the world , there is in my nature something of that lawlessness which belongs to high animal spirits , to the zest of adventure , and the warm blood that runs into song , chiefly because song is the voice of a joy . And no doubt , when I look back on the past years I must own that I have too often been led astray from the objects set before my reason , and cherished at my heart , by erring impulse or wanton fancy . "
209064	209071	209073	209073	Kenelm	261	" Petticoat interest , I presume , "
209077	209088	209090	209091	the minstrel	2047	" I wish I could honestly answer ' No , ' "
209096	209181	209090	209091	the minstrel	2047	" But from the worst , from all that would have permanently blasted the career to which I intrust my fortunes , all that would have rendered me unworthy of the pure love that now , I trust , awaits and crowns my dreams of happiness , I have been saved by the haunting smile in a sinless infantine face . Only once was I in great peril , - that hour of peril I recall with a shudder . It was at Luscombe . "
209182	209186	209343	209344	The minstrel	2047	" At Luscombe ! "
209187	209331	209090	209091	the minstrel	2047	" In the temptation of a terrible crime I thought I heard a voice say , ' Mischief ! Remember the little child . ' In that supervention which is so readily accepted as a divine warning , when the imagination is morbidly excited , and when the conscience , though lulled asleep for a moment , is still asleep so lightly that the sigh of a breeze , the fall of a leaf , can awake it with a start of terror , I took the voice for that of my guardian angel . Thinking it over later , and coupling the voice with the moral of those weird lines you repeated to me so appositely the next day , I conclude that I am not mistaken when I say it was from your lips that the voice which preserved me came . "
209332	209342	209343	209344	The minstrel	2047	" I confess the impertinence : you pardon it ? "
209354	209599	209343	209344	The minstrel	2047	" Pardon it ! Oh , could you but guess what cause I have to be grateful , everlastingly grateful ! That sudden cry , the remorse and horror of my own self that it struck into me , - deepened by those rugged lines which the next day made me shrink in dismay from ' the face of my darling sin ' ! Then came the turning - point of my life . From that day , the lawless vagabond within me was killed . I mean not , indeed , the love of Nature and of song which had first allured the vagabond , but the hatred of steadfast habits and of serious work , - that was killed . I no longer trifled with my calling : I took to it as a serious duty . And when I saw her , whom fate has reserved and reared for my bride , her face was no longer in my eyes that of the playful child ; the soul of the woman was dawning into it . It is but two years since that day , to me so eventful . Yet my fortunes are now secured . And if fame be not established , I am at last in a position which warrants my saying to her I love , ' The time has come when , without fear for thy future , I can ask thee to be mine . ' "
209652	209664	209650	209650	himself	261	" And the time , too , has come for me ! "
209677	209710	209669	209670	the minstrel	2047	" Sir , your turn : pray have you long known - judging by our former conversation you can not have long loved - the lady whom you have wooed and won ? "
209753	209839	209745	209745	he	261	" It seems to me that the coming of love is like the coming of spring : the date is not to be reckoned by the calendar . It may be slow and gradual ; it may be quick and sudden . But in the morning , when we wake and recognize a change in the world without , verdure on the trees , blossoms on the sward , warmth in the sunshine , music in the air , then we say Spring has come ! "
209840	209898	209669	209670	the minstrel	2047	" I like your illustration . And if it be an idle question to ask a lover how long he has known the beloved one , so it is almost as idle to ask if she be not beautiful . He can not but see in her face the beauty she has given to the world without . "
209899	209958	209745	209745	he	261	" True ; and that thought is poetic enough to make me remind you that I favoured you with the maiden specimen of my verse - making on condition that you repaid me by a specimen of your own practical skill in the art . And I claim the right to suggest the theme . Let it be - "
209959	209964	209669	209670	the minstrel	2047	" Of a beefsteak ? "
209965	210011	209745	209745	he	261	" Tush , you have worn out that tasteless joke at my expense . The theme must be of love , and if you could improvise a stanza or two expressive of the idea you just uttered I shall listen with yet more pleased attention . "
210012	210094	209669	209670	the minstrel	2047	" Alas ! I am no improvisatore . Yet I will avenge myself on your former neglect of my craft by chanting to you a trifle somewhat in unison with the thought you ask me to versify , but which you would not stay to hear at Tor Hadham though you did drop a shilling into Max 's tray ; it was one of the songs I sang that evening , and it was not ill - received by my humble audience .
210095	210107	209745	209745	he	261	" THE BEAUTY OF THE MISTRESS IS IN THE LOVER 'S EYE .
210108	210141	209669	209670	the minstrel	2047	" Is she not pretty , my Mabel May ? Nobody ever yet called her so . Are not her lineaments faultless , say ? If I must answer you plainly , No .
210142	210179	209745	209745	he	261	" Joy to believe that the maid I love None but myself as she is can see ; Joy that she steals from her heaven above , And is only revealed on this earth to me ! "
210198	210224	210191	210192	the minstrel	2047	" Now I must bid you good - by . My way lies through those meadows , and yours no doubt along the high road . "
210225	210256	210191	210192	the minstrel	2047	" Not so . Permit me to accompany you . I have a lodging not far from hence , to which the path through the fields is the shortest way . "
210313	210330	210310	210310	he	4945	" that he wished the way were longer , since it would be so pleasantly halved , "
210677	210706	210670	210672	a rich man	8707	" The child has genius : I will give it the discipline of culture ; one day it shall repay to the world what it owes to me ; "
210791	210795	210796	210796	he	2047	" But even , "
210801	211045	210796	210796	he	2047	" even in such hasty and crude manifestations of what is within me , as circumstances limited my powers , I know that I ought to have found from those who profess to be authoritative judges the encouragement of praise . How much better , then , I should have done if I had found it ! How a little praise warms out of a man the good that is in him , and the sneer of a contempt which he feels to be unjust chills the ardour to excel ! However , I forced my way , so far as was then most essential to me , the sufficing breadmaker for those I loved ; and in my holidays of song and ramble I found a delight that atoned for all the rest . But still the desire of fame , once conceived in childhood , once nourished through youth , never dies but in our grave . Foot and hoof may tread it down , bud , leaf , stalk ; its root is too deep below the surface for them to reach , and year after year stalk and leaf and bud re - emerge . Love may depart from our mortal life : we console ourselves ; the beloved will be reunited to us in the life to come . But if he who sets his heart on fame loses it in this life , what can console him ? "
211046	211062	211187	211188	the minstrel	2047	" Did you not say a little while ago that fame allowed of no grave ? "
211063	211166	210796	210796	he	2047	" True ; but if we do not achieve it before we ourselves are in the grave , what comfort can it give to us ? Love ascends to heaven , to which we hope ourselves to ascend ; but fame remains on the earth , which we shall never again revisit . And it is because fame is earth - born that the desire for it is the most lasting , the regret for the want of it the most bitter , to the child of earth . But I shall achieve it now ; it is already in my grasp . "
211203	211258	211198	211198	his	261	" Is it not time that we should make ourselves known to each other by name ? I have no longer any cause to conceal mine , indeed I never had any cause stronger than whim , - Kenelm Chillingly , the only son of Sir Peter , of Exmundham , - - -shire . "
211259	211271	211273	211274	the minstrel	2047	" I wish your father joy of so clever a son , "
211280	211517	211273	211274	the minstrel	2047	" You already know enough of me to be aware that I am of much humbler birth and station than you ; but if you chance to have visited the exhibition of the Royal Academy this year - ah ! I understand that start - you might have recognized a picture of which you have seen the rudimentary sketch , ' The Girl with the Flower - ball , ' one of three pictures very severely handled by ' The Londoner , ' but , in spite of that potent enemy , insuring fortune and promising fame to the wandering minstrel , whose name , if the sight of the pictures had induced you to inquire into that , you would have found to be Walter Melville . Next January I hope , thanks to that picture , to add , ' Associate of the Royal Academy . ' The public will not let them keep me out of it , in spite of ' The Londoner . ' You are probably an expected guest at one of the more imposing villas from which we see the distant lights . I am going to a very humble cottage , in which henceforth I hope to find my established home . I am there now only for a few days , but pray let me welcome you there before I leave . The cottage is called Grasmere . "
211609	211632	211587	211587	Kenelm	261	" Singing , singing , Lustily singing , Down the road , with his dogs before , Came the Ritter of Nierestein . "
211957	211987	211949	211949	his	261	" So might a child speak of a parent : not so does the maiden speak of the man she loves ; she can scarcely trust herself to praise . "
212138	212206	212109	212109	she	206	" I was just about to come to you . Happily , however , you find me alone , and what may pass between us will be soon over . But first tell me : you have seen your parents ; you have asked their consent to we d a girl such as I described ; tell me , oh tell me that that consent is refused ! "
212207	212227	212109	212109	she	206	" On the contrary , I am here with their full permission to ask the hand of your niece . "
212251	212318	212237	212237	herself	206	" I feared that . Walter said he had met you last evening ; that you , like himself , entertained the thought of marriage . You , of course when you learned his name , must have known with whom his thought was connected . Happily , he could not divine what was the choice to which your youthful fancy had been so blindly led . "
212319	212325	212327	212327	Kenelm	261	" My dear Mrs. Cameron , "
212336	212438	212327	212327	Kenelm	261	" you were aware of the purpose for which I left Moleswich a few days ago , and it seems to me that you might have forestalled my intention , the intention which brings me ; thus early to your house . I come to say to Miss Mordaunt 's guardian , ' I ask the hand of your ward . If you also woo her , I have a very noble rival . With both of us no consideration for our own happiness can be comparable to the duty of consulting hers . Let her choose between the two . ' "
212439	212442	212444	212445	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Impossible ! "
212447	212645	212444	212445	Mrs. Cameron	206	" impossible . You know not what you say ; know not , guess not , how sacred are the claims of Walter Melville to all that the orphan whom he has protected from her very birth can give him in return . She has no right to a preference for another : her heart is too grateful to admit of one . If the choice were given to her between him and you , it is he whom she would choose . Solemnly I assure you of this . Do not , then , subject her to the pain of such a choice . Suppose , if you will , that you had attracted her fancy , and that now you proclaimed your love and urged your suit , she would not , must not , the less reject your hand , but you might cloud her happiness in accepting Melville 's . Be generous . Conquer your own fancy ; it can be but a passing one . Speak not to her , nor to Mr. Melville , of a wish which can never be realized . Go hence , silently , and at once . "
212676	212913	212668	212668	he	4997	" I can not obey you . It seems to me that my honour commands me to prove to your niece that , if I mistook the nature of her feelings towards me , I did not , by word or look , lead her to believe mine towards herself were less in earnest than they are ; and it seems scarcely less honourable towards my worthy rival to endanger his own future happiness , should he discover later that his bride would have been happier with another . Why be so mysteriously apprehensive ? If , as you say , with such apparent conviction , there is no doubt of your niece 's preference for another , at a word from her own lips I depart , and you will see me no more . But that word must be said by her ; and if you will not permit me to ask for it in your own house , I will take my chance of finding her now , on her walk with Mr. Melville ; and , could he deny me the right to speak to her alone , that which I would say can be said in his presence . Ah ! madam , have you no mercy for the heart that you so needlessly torture ? If I must bear the worst , let me learn it , and at once . "
212914	212924	212926	212927	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Learn it , then , from my lips , "
212943	213186	212926	212927	Mrs. Cameron	206	" And I place the secret you wring from me under the seal of that honour which you so vauntingly make your excuse for imperilling the peace of the home I ought never to have suffered you to enter . An honest couple , of humble station and narrow means , had an only son , who evinced in early childhood talents so remarkable that they attracted the notice of the father 's employer , a rich man of very benevolent heart and very cultivated taste . He sent the child , at his expense , to a first - rate commercial school , meaning to provide for him later in his own firm . The rich man was the head partner of an eminent bank ; but very infirm health , and tastes much estranged from business , had induced him to retire from all active share in the firm , the management of which was confined to a son whom he idolized . But the talents of the protege he had sent to school took there so passionate a direction towards art and estranged from trade , and his designs in drawing when shown to connoisseurs were deemed so promising of future excellence , that the patron changed his original intention , entered him as a pupil in the studio of a distinguished French painter , and afterwards bade him perfect his taste by the study of Italian and Flemish masterpieces .
213187	213195	213197	213198	Mrs. Cameron	206	" He was still abroad , when - "
213220	213406	213197	213198	Mrs. Cameron	206	" when a thunderbolt fell on the house of the patron , shattering his fortunes , blasting his name . The son , unknown to the father , had been decoyed into speculations which proved unfortunate : the loss might have been easily retrieved in the first instance ; unhappily he took the wrong course to retrieve it , and launched into new hazards . I must be brief . One day the world was startled by the news that a firm , famed for its supposed wealth and solidity , was bankrupt . Dishonesty was alleged , was proved , not against the father , - he went forth from the trial , censured indeed for neglect , not condemned for fraud , but a penniless pauper . The - son , the son , the idolized son , was removed from the prisoner 's dock , a convicted felon , sentenced to penal servitude ; escaped that sentence by - by - you guess - you guess . How could he escape except through death ? - death by his own guilty deed ? "
213491	213991	213486	213487	Mrs. Cameron	206	" I said the father was a penniless pauper ; he died lingeringly bedridden . But one faithful friend did not desert that bed , - the youth to whose genius his wealth had ministered . He had come from abroad with some modest savings from the sale of copies or sketches made in Florence . These savings kept a roof over the heads of the old man and the two helpless , broken - hearted women , - paupers like himself , - his own daughter and his son 's widow . When the savings were gone , the young man stooped from his destined calling , found employment somehow , no matter how alien to his tastes , and these three whom his toil supported never wanted a home or food . Well , a few weeks after her husband 's terrible death , his young widow they had not been a year married gave birth to a child , - a girl . She did not survive the exhaustion of her confinement many days . The shock of her death snapped the feeble thread of the poor father 's life . Both were borne to the grave on the same day . Before they died , both made the same prayer to their sole two mourners , the felon 's sister , the old man 's young benefactor . The prayer was this , that the new - born infant should be reared , however humbly , in ignorance of her birth , of a father 's guilt and shame . She was not to pass a suppliant for charity to rich and high - born kinsfolk , who had vouchsafed no word even of pity to the felon 's guiltless father and as guiltless wife . That promise has been kept till now . I am that daughter . The name I bear , and the name which I gave to my niece , are not ours , save as we may indirectly claim them through alliances centuries ago . I have never married . I was to have been a bride , bringing to the representative of no ignoble house what was to have been a princely dower ; the wedding day was fixed , when the bolt fell . I have never again seen my betrothed . He went abroad and died there . I think he loved me ; he knew I loved him . Who can blame him for deserting me ? Who could marry the felon 's sister ? Who would marry the felon 's child ? Who but one ? The man who knows her secret , and will guard it ; the man who , caring little for other education , has helped to instil into her spotless childhood so steadfast a love of truth , so exquisite a pride of honour , that did she know such ignominy rested on her birth she would pine herself away . "
213992	214001	214003	214003	Kenelm	261	" Is there only one man on earth , "
214035	214293	214008	214008	his	261	" is there only one man who would deem the virgin at whose feet he desires to kneel and say , ' Deign to be the queen of my life , ' not far too noble in herself to be debased by the sins of others before she was even born ; is there only one man who does not think that the love of truth and the pride of honour are most royal attributes of woman or of man , no matter whether the fathers of the woman or the man were pirates as lawless as the fathers of Norman kings , or liars as unscrupulous , where their own interests were concerned , as have been the crowned representatives of lines as deservedly famous as Caesars and Bourbons , Tudors and Stuarts ? Nobility , like genius , is inborn . One man alone guard her secret ! - guard a secret that if made known could trouble a heart that recoils from shame ! Ah , madam , we Chillinglys are a very obscure , undistinguished race , but for more than a thousand years we have been English gentlemen . Guard her secret rather than risk the chance of discovery that could give her a pang ! I would pass my whole life by her side in Kamtchatka , and even there I would not snatch a glimpse of the secret itself with mine own eyes : it should be so closely muffled and wrapped round by the folds of reverence and worship . "
214373	214408	214368	214369	Mrs. Cameron	206	" All this is hollow talk , Mr. Chillingly ; let us come to the point . After all I have said , do you mean to persist in your suit to my niece ? "
214409	214413	214368	214369	Mrs. Cameron	206	" I persist . "
214414	214417	214418	214418	she	206	" What ! "
214430	214567	214418	214418	she	206	" what , even were it possible that you could win your parents ' consent to marry the child of a man condemned to penal servitude , or , consistently with the duties a son owes to parents , conceal that fact from them , could you , born to a station on which every gossip will ask , ' Who and what is the name of the future Lady Chillingly ? ' believe that the who and the what will never be discovered ! Have you , a mere stranger , unknown to us a few weeks ago , a right to say to Walter Melville , ' Resign to me that which is your sole reward for the sublime sacrifices , for the loyal devotion , for the watchful tenderness of patient years ' ? "
214568	214573	214575	214575	Kenelm	261	" Surely , madam , "
214657	214657	214607	214607	my	0	"
214658	214842	214843	214843	She	5012	" I did not then know , Heaven is my witness , I did not then even suspect , that Walter Melville ever dreamed of seeking a wife in the child who had grown up under his eyes . You must own , indeed , how much I discouraged your suit ; I could not discourage it more without revealing the secret of her birth , only to be revealed as an extreme necessity . But my persuasion was that your father would not consent to your alliance with one so far beneath the expectations he was entitled to form , and the refusal of that consent would terminate all further acquaintance between you and Lily , leaving her secret undisclosed . It was not till you had left , only indeed two days ago , that I received a letter from Walter Melville , - a letter which told me what I had never before conjectured . Here is the letter , read it , and then say if you have the heart to force yourself into rivalry , with - with - "
215081	215085	215075	215075	he	5498	" I give ! "
215285	215354	215274	215274	her	526	" I am dying : the last words of the dying are commands . I command you to see that my child 's lot is not that of a felon 's daughter transported to the hearth of nobles . To be happy , her lot must be humble : no roof too humble to shelter , no husband too humble to we d , the felon 's daughter . "
215389	215405	215383	215383	I	0	" I am humbly born , but thy mother would have given thee to me . "

216389	216399	216386	216386	she	526	" Yes ; it is for me you work , "
216548	216558	216559	216559	Yours	5092	" Is Lily to be my wife or not ? "
216581	216630	216577	216578	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Now , sir , what say you ? You have scarcely known Lily five weeks . What is the feverish fancy of five weeks ' growth to the lifelong devotion of a man like this ? Do you now dare to say , ' I persist ' ? "
216665	216708	216651	216651	his	261	" This man is more worthy of her than I. He prays you , in his letter , to prepare your niece for that change of relationship which he dreads too abruptly to break to her himself . Have you done so ? "
216709	216720	216758	216758	she	206	" I have ; the night I got the letter . "
216721	216736	216651	216651	his	261	" And - you hesitate ; speak truthfully , I implore . And she - "

217454	217467	217440	217440	he	261	" I have so much to thank you for , Mrs. Cameron . "
217468	217526	217423	217424	Mrs. Cameron	206	" But you are not going already , - just as I enter too . Hold ! Mrs. Cameron tells me you are lodging with my old friend Jones . Come and stop a couple of days with us : we can find you a room ; the room over your butterfly cage , eh , Fairy ? "
217527	217548	217440	217440	he	261	" Thank you too . Thank you all . No ; I must be in London by the first train . "
217576	217596	217598	217599	the artist	6890	" Pardon his abruptness , Lily ; he too loves ; he too is impatient to find a betrothed , "
217602	217626	217598	217599	the artist	6890	" but now he knows my dearest secret , I think I have a right to know his ; and I will try . "
217648	217678	217634	217634	he	5105	" If you are going back to Cromwell Lodge , - to pack up , I suppose , - let me walk with you as far as the bridge . "
217746	217751	217737	217739	the old woman	1995	" God bless you ! "
217869	217874	217875	217875	she	526	" Good - by , "
217881	217904	217875	217875	she	526	" good - by forever in this world . You understand , - you do understand me . Say that you do . "
217905	217923	217925	217925	Kenelm	261	" I understand . Noble child ! noble choice ! God bless you ! God comfort me ! "
217995	218019	218023	218023	his	261	" Words can not say how fair seems life ; how easy seems conquest of fame , dating from this day - this day "
218067	218076	218078	218079	the artist	6890	" They who knew her even the best , "
218084	218213	218078	218079	the artist	6890	" even her aunt , never could guess how serious and earnest , under all her infantine prettiness of fancy , is that girl 's real nature . We were walking along the brook - side , when I began to tell how solitary the world would be to me if I could not win her to my side ; while I spoke she had turned aside from the path we had taken , and it was not till we were under the shadow of the church in which we shall be married that she uttered the word that gives to every cloud in my fate the silver lining ; implying thus how solemnly connected in her mind was the thought of love with the sanctity of religion . "
218239	218252	218254	218255	the artist	6890	" But I am talking a great deal too much about myself , "
218257	218314	218254	218255	the artist	6890	" Lovers are the most consummate of all egotists , and the most garrulous of all gossips . You have wished me joy on my destined nuptials , when shall I wish you joy on yours ? Since we have begun to confide in each other , you are in my debt as to a confidence . "
218327	218359	218322	218322	Kenelm	261	" Good - day ; let us part here . I have nothing to confide to you that might not seem to your ears a mockery when I wish you joy . "
218435	218444	218430	218430	he	261	" he had acquired the right to learn , "
218456	218460	218461	218461	he	261	" Poor fellow ! "
218467	218520	218461	218461	he	261	" how natural that he should fall in love with Fairy ! but happily he is so young , and such a philosopher , that it is but one of those trials through which , at least ten times a year , I have gone with wounds that leave not a scar . "
218906	219363	218897	218898	Sir Peter	421	" MY DEAREST FATHER , - Never till my dying day shall I forget that tender desire for my happiness with which , overcoming all worldly considerations , no matter at what disappointment to your own cherished plans or ambition for the heir to your name and race , you sent me away from your roof , these words ringing in my ear like the sound of joy - bells , ' Choose as you will , with my blessing on your choice . I open my heart to admit another child : your wife shall be my daughter . ' It is such an unspeakable comfort to me to recall those words now . Of all human affections gratitude is surely the holiest ; and it blends itself with the sweetness of religion when it is gratitude to a father . And , therefore , do not grieve too much for me , when I tell you that the hopes which enchanted me when we parted are not to be fulfilled . Her hand is pledged to another , - another with claims upon her preference to which mine can not be compared ; and he is himself , putting aside the accidents of birth and fortune , immeasurably my superior . In that thought - I mean the thought that the man she selects deserves her more than I do , and that in his happiness she will blend her own - I shall find comfort , so soon as I can fairly reason down the first all - engrossing selfishness that follows the sense of unexpected and irremediable loss . Meanwhile you will think it not unnatural that I resort to such aids for change of heart as are afforded by change of scene . I start for the Continent to - night , and shall not rest till I reach Venice , which I have not yet seen . I feel irresistibly attracted towards still canals and gliding gondolas . I will write to you and to my dear mother the day I arrive . And I trust to write cheerfully , with full accounts of all I see and encounter . Do not , dearest father , in your letters to me , revert or allude to that grief which even the tenderest word from your own tender self might but chafe into pain more sensitive . After all , a disappointed love is a very common lot . And we meet every day , men - ay , and women too - who have known it , and are thoroughly cured . The manliest of our modern lyrical poets has said very nobly , and , no doubt , very justly ,
219364	219372	219410	219411	the other	5689	" To bear is to conquer our fate .
219373	219378	218897	218898	Sir Peter	421	" Ever your loving son ,
219379	219382	219410	219411	the other	5689	" K. C. "
219761	219818	219744	219746	the younger man	5162	" Lay your hand on your heart , Tom , and answer me truly . Are your thoughts as clear from regrets as the heavens above us are from a cloud ? Man takes regret from tears that have ceased to flow , as the heavens take clouds from the rains that have ceased to fall . "
219819	219864	219735	219740	the man reclining on the grass	5161	" Regrets ? Ah , I understand , for the loss of the girl I once loved to distraction ! No ; surely I made that clear to you many , many , many months ago , when I was your guest at Moleswich . "
219865	219974	219744	219746	the younger man	5162	" Ay , but I have never , since then , spoken to you on that subject . I did not dare . It seems to me so natural that a man , in the earlier struggle between love and reason , should say , ' Reason shall conquer , and has conquered ; ' and yet - and yet - as time glides on , feel that the conquerors who can not put down rebellion have a very uneasy reign . Answer me not as at Moleswich , during the first struggle , but now , in the after - day , when reaction from struggle comes . "
219975	219980	219982	219983	the friend	5163	" Upon my honour , "
219985	220055	219982	219983	the friend	5163	" I have had no reaction at all . I was cured entirely , when I had once seen Jessie again , another man 's wife , mother to his child , happy in her marriage ; and , whether she was changed or not , - very different from the sort of wife I should like to marry , now that I am no longer a village farrier . "
220056	220119	219744	219746	the younger man	5162	" And , I remember , you spoke of some other girl whom it would suit you to marry . You have been long abroad from her . Do you ever think of her , - think of her still as your future wife ? Can you love her ? Can you , who have once loved so faithfully , love again ? "
220120	220148	220149	220149	Tom	359	" I am sure of that . I love Emily better than I did when I left England . We correspond . She writes such nice letters . "
220158	220170	220149	220149	Tom	359	" I should like to show you one of her letters . "
220171	220174	219744	219746	the younger man	5162	" Do . "
220378	220402	220367	220367	his	261	" Are you not tired of this place , Tom ? I am . Let us go back to England to - morrow . "
220410	220419	220421	220421	Kenelm	261	" How selfish and egotistical I have been ! "
220423	220443	220421	220421	Kenelm	261	" I ought to have thought more of you , your career , your marriage , - pardon me - "
220444	220494	220367	220367	his	261	" Pardon you , - pardon ! Do n't I owe to you all , - owe to you Emily herself ? If you had never come to Graveleigh , never said , ' Be my friend , ' what should I have been now ? what - what ? "
220589	220677	220717	220717	Kenelm	261	" If I have rightly understood you , Tom , all this change in you , all this cure of torturing regret , was wrought , wrought lastingly , - wrought so as to leave you heart - free for the world 's actions and a home 's peace , on that eve when you saw her whose face till then had haunted you , another man 's happy wife , and in so seeing her , either her face was changed or your heart became so . "
220678	220695	220717	220717	Kenelm	261	" Quite true . I might express it otherwise , but the fact remains the same . "
220696	220715	220717	220717	Kenelm	261	" God bless you , Tom ; bless you in your career without , in your home within , "
220972	220977	220979	220979	he	261	" Ha ! ha ! "
220992	221115	220979	220979	he	261	" Ha ! ha ! I shall exorcise the ghost of my grief . I shall never be haunted again . If that stormy creature whom love might have maddened into crime , if he were cured of love at once by a single visit to the home of her whose face was changed to him , - for the smiles and the tears of it had become the property of another man , - how much more should I be left without a scar ! I , the heir of the Chillinglys ! I , the kinsman of a Mivers ! I , the pupil of a Welby ! I - I , Kenelm Chillingly , to be thus - thus - "
221323	221355	221305	221305	He	261	" Let me just see her and her happiness , and then I will knock boldly at the door , and say , ' Good - evening , Mrs. Melville . ' "
221562	221569	221571	221571	Kenelm	261	" He has had joyous news , "
221573	221587	221571	221571	Kenelm	261	" He has sent for his wife that she may share his joy . "
221706	221709	221711	221711	Kenelm	261	" Ah , "
221713	221733	221711	221711	Kenelm	261	" the letter is from Lily . She is abroad . Perhaps the birth of a first - born . "
222022	222028	222021	222021	her	526	" own - own room . "
222221	222225	222227	222227	he	261	" Natural enough , "
222229	222255	222227	222227	he	261	" She has outgrown all such pretty silliness . A wife can not remain a child . Still , if she had belonged to me - "
222299	222358	222266	222266	He	261	" No , - no , - no . I can not now enter that house and ask for Mrs. Melville . Trial enough for one night to stand on the old ground . I will return to the town . I will call at Jessie 's , and there I can learn if she indeed be happy . "
222476	222483	222484	222484	he	261	" Ah ! child ! child ! "
222489	222560	222484	222484	he	261	" what depths of woman tenderness lay concealed in thee ! In what loving sympathy with the past - sympathy only vouchsafed to the tenderest women and the highest poets - didst thou lay thy flowers on the tomb , to which thou didst give a poet 's history interpreted by a woman 's heart , little dreaming that beneath the stone slept a hero of thine own fallen race . "
222798	222800	222823	222823	he	261	" everlasting "
222818	222822	222823	222823	he	261	" And yet , "
222862	222862	222851	222851	she	5235	"
222892	222895	222899	222900	the laurestinus	5246	" everlastings , "
223007	223017	223004	223005	WALTER MELVILLE	627	" Suffer the little children to come unto me . "
223113	223123	223146	223146	he	5255	" Poor fellow overtaken by drink , I fear , "
223271	223282	223314	223314	Augustus	647	" Mr. Chillingly , - you ! Is it possible ? "
223283	223288	223290	223290	Kenelm	261	" Varus , Varus , "
223294	223303	223290	223290	Kenelm	261	" what hast thou done with my legions ? "
223368	223418	223427	223428	the rector	5253	" I beg pardon , Mr. Emlyn ; I had not quite shaken off the hold of a strange dream . I dreamed that I was worse off than Augustus : he did not lose the world when the legions he had trusted to another vanished into a grave . "
223458	223468	223470	223470	Emlyn	570	" But how long have you returned to Moleswich ? "
223472	223488	223470	223470	Emlyn	570	" and how came you to choose so damp a bed for your morning slumbers ? "
223489	223563	223427	223428	the rector	5253	" The wintry cold crept into my veins when I stood in the burial - ground , and I was very weary ; I had no sleep at night . Do not let me take you out of your way ; I am going on to Grasmere . So I see , by the record on a gravestone , that it is more than a year ago since Mr. Melville lost his wife . "
223564	223571	223470	223470	Emlyn	570	" Wife ? He never married . "
223572	223575	223577	223577	Kenelm	261	" What ! "
223579	223594	223577	223577	Kenelm	261	" Whose , then , is that gravestone , - ' L. M. ' ? "
223595	223605	223470	223470	Emlyn	570	" Alas ! it is our poor Lily 's . "
223606	223612	223577	223577	Kenelm	261	" And she died unmarried ? "
223634	223642	223643	223643	he	261	" I may claim thee , then , "
223648	223658	223643	223643	he	261	" claim thee as mine when we meet again . "
223659	223665	223667	223668	the vicar	4048	" Unmarried , - yes , "
223670	223818	223667	223668	the vicar	4048	" She was indeed betrothed to her guardian ; they were to have been married in the autumn , on his return from the Rhine . He went there to paint on the spot itself his great picture , which is now so famous , - ' Roland , the Hermit Knight , looking towards the convent lattice for a sight of the Holy Nun . ' Melville had scarcely gone before the symptoms of the disease which proved fatal to poor Lily betrayed themselves ; they baffled all medical skill , - rapid decline . She was always very delicate , but no one detected in her the seeds of consumption . Melville only returned a day or two before her death . Dear childlike Lily ! how we all mourned for her ! - not least the poor , who believed in her fairy charms . "
223819	223836	223643	223643	he	261	" And least of all , it appears , the man she was to have married . "
223837	223861	223667	223668	the vicar	4048	" He ? - Melville ? How can you wrong him so ? His grief was intense - overpowering - for the time . "
223862	223870	223872	223872	Kenelm	261	" For the time ! what time ? "
223894	223938	223889	223890	Mr. Emlyn	570	" You noticed the text on Lily 's gravestone - ' Suffer the little children to come unto me ' ? She dictated it herself the day before she died . I was with her then , so I was at the last . "
223939	223983	223667	223668	the vicar	4048	" Were you - were you - at the last - the last ? Good - day , Mr. Emlyn ; we are just in sight of the garden gate . And - excuse me - I wish to see Mr. Melville alone . "
223984	224019	223889	223890	Mr. Emlyn	570	" Well , then , good - day ; but if you are making any stay in the neighbourhood , will you not be our guest ? We have a room at your service . "
224020	224056	223667	223668	the vicar	4048	" I thank you gratefully ; but I return to London in an hour or so . Hold , a moment . You were with her at the last ? She was resigned to die ? "
224057	224088	223889	223890	Mr. Emlyn	570	" Resigned ! that is scarcely the word . The smile left upon her lips was not that of human resignation : it was the smile of a divine joy . "
224092	224106	223667	223668	the vicar	4048	" YES , sir , Mr. Melville is at home in his studio . "
224158	224165	224131	224132	the artist	6890	" the souls of infants unbaptized . "
224276	224288	224255	224255	his	261	" Since we parted , such grief ! such a loss ! "
224289	224345	224255	224255	his	261	" I know it ; I have seen her grave . Let us not speak of it . Why so needlessly revive your sorrow ? So - so - your sanguine hopes are fulfilled : the world at last has done you justice ? Emlyn tells me that you have painted a very famous picture . "
224384	224410	224381	224381	he	8548	" Yes , wait a moment , do n't talk of fame yet . Bear with me . The sudden sight of you unnerved me . "
224574	224628	224557	224557	Melville	534	" Yes , my last picture has been indeed a success , - a reward complete , if tardy , for all the bitterness of former struggles made in vain , for the galling sense of injustice , the anguish of which only an artist knows , when unworthy rivals are ranked before him .
224629	224642	224557	224557	Melville	534	" ' Foes quick to blame , and friends afraid to praise . '
224643	224753	224557	224557	Melville	534	" True that I have still much to encounter ; the cliques still seek to disparage me , but between me and the cliques there stands at last the giant form of the public , and at last critics of graver weight than the cliques have deigned to accord to me a higher rank than even the public yet acknowledge . Ah , Mr. Chillingly , you do not profess to be a judge of paintings , but , excuse me , just look at this letter . I received it only last night from the greatest connoisseur of my art , certainly in England , perhaps in Europe . "
224819	224823	224864	224864	he	261	" Paradise Lost , "
224937	225005	224928	224928	He	261	" This is the letter I saw you reading last night as I looked in at your window . Indeed , for a man who cares for the opinion of other men , this letter is very flattering ; and for the painter who cares for money , it must be very pleasant to know by how many guineas every inch of his canvas may be covered . "
225027	225136	225022	225022	Kenelm	261	" Man , man , whom I once accepted as a teacher on human life , - a teacher to warm , to brighten , to exalt mine own indifferent , dreamy , slow - pulsed self ! has not the one woman whom thou didst select out of this overcrowded world to be bone of thy bone , flesh of thy flesh , vanished evermore from the earth , - little more than a year since her voice was silenced , her heart ceased to beat ? But how slight is such loss to thy life compared to the worth of a compliment that flatters thy vanity ! "
225188	225192	225194	225194	Melville	534	" Poor friend , "
225200	225214	225194	225194	Melville	534	" I did not think you loved her thus deeply . Pardon me . "
225238	225624	225215	225215	He	534	" I am not so heartless , not so forgetful of my loss as you suppose . But reflect , you have but just learned of her death , you are under the first shock of grief . More than a year has been given to me for gradual submission to the decree of Heaven . Now listen to me , and try to listen calmly . I am many years older than you : I ought to know better the conditions on which man holds the tenure of life . Life is composite , many - sided : nature does not permit it to be lastingly monopolized by a single passion , or while yet in the prime of its strength to be lastingly blighted by a single sorrow . Survey the great mass of our common race , engaged in the various callings , some the humblest , some the loftiest , by which the business of the world is carried on , - can you justly despise as heartless the poor trader , or the great statesman , when it may be but a few days after the loss of some one nearest and dearest to his heart , the trader reopens his shop , the statesman reappears in his office ? But in me , the votary of art , in me you behold but the weakness of gratified vanity ; if I feel joy in the hope that my art may triumph , and my country may add my name to the list of those who contribute to her renown , where and when ever lived an artist not sustained by that hope , in privation , in sickness , in the sorrows he must share with his kind ? Nor is this hope that of a feminine vanity , a sicklier craving for applause ; it identifies itself with glorious services to our land , to our race , to the children of all after time . Our art can not triumph , our name can not live , unless we achieve a something that tends to beautify or ennoble the world in which we accept the common heritage of toil and of sorrow , in order therefrom to work out for successive multitudes a recreation and a joy . "
225675	225678	225680	225680	Kenelm	261	" Enough , "
225684	225815	225680	225680	Kenelm	261	" There is a ring of truth in what you say . I can conceive the artist 's , the poet 's escape from this world , when all therein is death and winter , into the world he creates and colours at his will with the hues of summer . So , too , I can conceive how the man whose life is sternly fitted into the grooves of a trader 's calling , or a statesman 's duties , is borne on by the force of custom , afar from such brief halting - spot as a grave . But I am no poet , no artist , no trader , no statesman ; I have no calling , my life is fixed into no grooves . Adieu . "
225816	225880	225923	225924	Mrs. Cameron	206	" Hold a moment . Not now , but somewhat later , ask yourself whether any life can be permitted to wander in space , a monad detached from the lives of others . Into some groove or other , sooner or later , it must settle , and be borne on obedient to the laws of Nature and the responsibility to God . "
225926	225931	225932	225932	she	206	" I saw you , "
225935	225968	225932	225932	she	206	" from my window coming to the house , and I have been waiting for you here . I wished to speak to you alone . Allow me to walk beside you . "
226011	226064	226065	226065	She	206	" I have a great weight on my mind ; it ought not to be remorse . I acted as I thought in my conscience for the best . But oh , Mr. Chillingly , if I erred , - if I judged wrongly , do say you at least forgive me . "
226098	226168	226092	226093	Mrs. Cameron	206	" You could not have married Lily ; you know you could not . The secret of her birth could not , in honour , have been concealed from your parents . They could not have consented to your marriage ; and even if you had persisted , without that consent and in spite of that secret , to press for it , - even had she been yours - "
226169	226177	226179	226179	Kenelm	261	" Might she not be living now ? "
226183	226475	226092	226093	Mrs. Cameron	206	" No , - no ; the secret must have come out . The cruel world would have discovered it ; it would have reached her ears . The shame of it would have killed her . How bitter then would have been her short interval of life ! As it is , she passed away , - resigned and happy . But I own that I did not , could not , understand her , could not believe her feeling for you to be so deep . I did think that when she knew her own heart she would find that love for her guardian was its strongest affection . She assented , apparently without a pang , to become his wife ; and she seemed always so fond of him , and what girl would not be ? But I was mistaken , deceived . From the day you saw her last , she began to fade away ; but then Walter left a few days after , and I thought that it was his absence she mourned . She never owned to me that it was yours , - never till too late , - too late , - just when my sad letter had summoned him back , only three days before she died . Had I known earlier , while yet there was hope of recovery , I must have written to you , even though the obstacles to your union with her remained the same . Oh , again I implore you , say that if I erred you forgive me . She did , kissing me so tenderly . She did forgive me . Will not you ? It would have been her wish . "
226476	226517	226518	226518	He	5300	" Her wish ? Do you think I could disobey it ? I know not if I have anything to forgive . If I have , now could I not forgive one who loved her ? God comfort us both . "
226556	226635	226552	226552	she	5301	" And now , it is with so much lighter a heart that I can fulfil her commission to you . But , before I place this in your hands , can you make me one promise ? Never tell Melville how she loved you . She was so careful he should never guess that . And if he knew it was the thought of union with him which had killed her , he would never smile again . "
226636	226684	226552	226552	she	5301	" You would not ask such a promise if you could guess how sacred from all the world I hold the secret that you confide to me . By that secret the grave is changed into an altar . Our bridals now are only a while deferred . "
226704	226716	226552	226552	she	5301	" She gave it to me the day before her last , "
227205	227352	227201	227202	LADY GLENALVON	274	" I own , my dear , dear Cecilia , that I arrange myself at last on the side of your father . How earnestly at one time I had hoped that Kenelm Chillingly might woo and win the bride that seemed to me most fitted to adorn and to cheer his life , I need not say . But when at Exmundham he asked me to befriend his choice of another , to reconcile his mother to that choice , - evidently not a suitable one , - I gave him up . And though that affair is at an end , he seems little likely ever to settle down to practical duties and domestic habits , an idle wanderer over the face of the earth , only heard of in remote places and with strange companions . Perhaps he may never return to England . "
227356	227367	227353	227353	CECILIA	364	" He is in England now , and in London . "
227372	227382	227368	227369	LADY GLENALVON	274	" You amaze me ! Who told you so ? "
227386	227407	227383	227383	CECILIA	364	" His father , who is with him . Sir Peter called yesterday , and spoke to me so kindly . "
227429	227437	227425	227426	LADY GLENALVON	274	" Did Mr. Travers see Sir Peter ? "
227441	227470	227438	227438	CECILIA	364	" Yes ; and I think it was something that passed between them which made my father speak to me - for the first time - almost sternly . "
227475	227483	227471	227472	LADY GLENALVON	274	" In urging Chillingly Gordon 's suit ? "
227487	227505	227484	227484	CECILIA	364	" Commanding me to reconsider my rejection of it . He has contrived to fascinate my father . "
227510	227690	227506	227507	LADY GLENALVON	274	" So he has me . Of course you might choose among other candidates for your hand one of much higher worldly rank , of much larger fortune ; yet , as you have already rejected them , Gordon 's merits become still more entitled to a fair hearing . He has already leaped into a position that mere rank and mere wealth can not attain . Men of all parties speak highly of his parliamentary abilities . He is already marked in public opinion as a coming man , - a future minister of the highest grade . He has youth and good looks ; his moral character is without a blemish : yet his manners are so free from affected austerity , so frank , so genial . Any woman might be pleased with his companionship ; and you , with your intellect , your culture , - you , so born for high station , - you of all women might be proud to partake the anxieties of his career and the rewards of his ambition . "
227699	227741	227691	227691	CECILIA	364	" I can not , I can not . He may be all you say , - I know nothing against Mr. Chillingly Gordon , - but my whole nature is antagonistic to his , and even were it not so - "
227770	227792	227763	227764	LADY GLENALVON	274	" You have not , then , even yet conquered the first maiden fancy ; the ungrateful one is still remembered ? "
227807	227827	227793	227793	Cecilia	364	" Do n't speak against him ; he has been so unhappy . How much he must have loved ! "
227828	227838	227763	227764	LADY GLENALVON	274	" But it is not you whom he loved . "
227839	227870	227793	227793	Cecilia	364	" Something here , something at my heart , tells me that he will love me yet ; and , if not , I am contented to be his friend . "
228136	228139	228172	228172	he	193	" The Londoner "
228168	228171	228172	228172	he	193	" Nothing , "
228176	228236	228172	228172	he	193	" hurts a young Parliamentary speaker like violence in opinion , one way or the other . Shun it . Always allow that much may be said on both sides . When the chiefs of your own side suddenly adopt a violence , you can go with them or against them , according as best suits your own book . "
228237	228240	228242	228242	Mivers	196	" So , "
228292	228292	228267	228267	I	0	"
228293	228364	228267	228267	I	0	" True . It is the first time in which the debate has been arranged so that I may speak at ten o'clock or later . That in itself is a great leap ; and it is a Cabinet minister whom I am to answer , - luckily , he is a very dull fellow . Do you think I might hazard a joke , - at least a witticism ? "
228365	228515	228267	228267	I	0	" At his expense ? Decidedly not . Though his office compels him to introduce this measure , he was by no means in its favour when it was discussed in the Cabinet ; and though , as you say , he is dull , it is precisely that sort of dulness which is essential to the formation of every respectable Cabinet . Joke at him , indeed ! Learn that gentle dulness never loves a joke - at its own expense . Vain man ! seize the occasion which your blame of his measure affords you to secure his praise of yourself ; compliment him . Enough of politics . It never does to think too much over what one has already decided to say . Brooding over it , one may become too much in earnest , and commit an indiscretion . So Kenelm has come back ? "
228516	228540	228267	228267	I	0	" Yes . I heard that news last night , at White 's , from Travers . Sir Peter had called on Travers . "
228541	228551	228267	228267	I	0	" Travers still favours your suit to the heiress ? "
228552	228631	228267	228267	I	0	" More , I think , than ever . Success in Parliament has great effect on a man who has success in fashion and respects the opinion of clubs . But last night he was unusually cordial . Between you and me , I think he is a little afraid that Kenelm may yet be my rival . I gathered that from a hint he let fall of the unwelcome nature of Sir Peter 's talk to him . "
228632	228651	228267	228267	I	0	" Why has Travers conceived a dislike to poor Kenelm ? He seemed partial enough to him once . "
228652	228840	228267	228267	I	0	" Ay , but not as a son - in - law , even before I had a chance of becoming so . And when , after Kenelm appeared at Exmundham , while Travers was staying there , Travers learned , I suppose from Lady Chillingly , that Kenelm had fallen in love with and wanted to marry some other girl , who it seems rejected him ; and still more when he heard that Kenelm had been subsequently travelling on the Continent in company with a low - lived fellow , the drunken , riotous son of a farrier , you may well conceive how so polished and sensible a man as Leopold Travers would dislike the idea of giving his daughter to one so little likely to make an agreeable son - in - law . Bah ! I have no fear of Kenelm . By the way , did Sir Peter say if Kenelm had quite recovered his health ? He was at death 's door some eighteen months ago , when Sir Peter and Lady Chillingly were summoned to town by the doctors . "
228841	228911	228267	228267	I	0	" My dear Gordon , I fear there is no chance of your succession to Exmundham . Sir Peter says that his wandering Hercules is as stalwart as ever , and more equable in temperament , more taciturn and grave , - in short , less odd . But when you say you have no fear of Kenelm 's rivalry , do you mean only as to Cecilia Travers ? "
228912	228998	228267	228267	I	0	" Neither as to that nor as to anything in life ; and as to the succession to Exmundham , it is his to leave as he pleases , and I have cause to think he would never leave it to me . More likely to Parson John or the parson 's son , - or why not to yourself ? I often think that for the prizes immediately set before my ambition I am better off without land : land is a great obfuscator . "
228999	229028	228267	228267	I	0	" Humph , there is some truth in that . Yet the fear of land and obfuscation does not seem to operate against your suit to Cecilia Travers ? "
229029	229064	228267	228267	I	0	" Her father is likely enough to live till I maybe contented to ' rest and be thankful ' in the Upper House ; and I should not like to be a landless peer . "
229065	229098	228267	228267	I	0	" You are right there ; but I should tell you that , now Kenelm has come back , Sir Peter has set his heart on his son 's being your rival . "
229099	229103	228267	228267	I	0	" For Cecilia ? "
229104	229150	228267	228267	I	0	" Perhaps ; but certainly for Parliamentary reputation . The senior member for the county means to retire , and Sir Peter has been urged to allow his son to be brought forward , - from what I hear , with the certainty of success . "
229151	229167	228267	228267	I	0	" What ! in spite of that wonderful speech of his on coming of age ? "
229168	229265	228267	228267	I	0	" Pooh ! that is now understood to have been but a bad joke on the new ideas , and their organs , including ' The Londoner . ' But if Kenelm does come into the House , it will not be on your side of the question ; and unless I greatly overrate his abilities - which very likely I do - he will not be a rival to despise . Except , indeed , that he may have one fault which in the present day would be enough to unfit him for public life . "
229266	229273	228267	228267	I	0	" And what is that fault ? "
229274	229356	228267	228267	I	0	" Treason to the blood of the Chillinglys . This is the age , in England , when one can not be too much of a Chillingly . I fear that if Kenelm does become bewildered by a political abstraction , - call it , no matter what , say , ' love of his country , ' or some such old - fashioned crotchet , - I fear , I greatly fear , that he may be - in earnest . "
229472	229477	229448	229448	he	404	" Hear , hear ! "
229548	229586	229538	229538	he	7672	" Sir , I join issue with the right honourable gentleman opposite . He says this is not raised as a party question . I deny it . Her Majesty 's Government are put upon their trial . "
229616	229618	229538	229538	he	7672	" hum "
229621	229624	229538	229538	he	7672	" ha , "
229884	229886	229855	229856	Chillingly Gordon	193	" violence "
230120	230129	230109	230113	The chief of the Opposition	8586	" I wish we could get that man . "
230166	230176	230163	230164	his chief	5374	" That is a man we must not lose . "
230279	230316	230251	230252	George Belvoir	404	" Ha ! Chillingly , how are you ? Did not know you were in town . Been here all the evening ? Yes ; very good debate . How did you like Gordon 's speech ? "
230317	230324	230251	230252	George Belvoir	404	" I liked yours much better . "
230325	230328	230330	230330	George	404	" Mine ! "
230340	230378	230330	230330	George	404	" Oh , mine was a mere humdrum affair , a plain statement of the reasons for the vote I should give . And Gordon 's was anything but that . You did not like his opinions ? "
230379	230397	230251	230252	George Belvoir	404	" I do n't know what his opinions are . But I did not like his ideas . "
230398	230409	230330	230330	George	404	" I do n't quite understand you . What ideas ? "
230410	230430	230251	230252	George Belvoir	404	" The new ones ; by which it is shown how rapidly a great state can be made small . "
230522	230584	230682	230682	his	421	" It tells much for the duration of a people when it accords with the instinct of immortality in a man ; when an honoured tomb is deemed recompense for the toils and dangers of a noble life . How much of the history of England Nelson summed up in the simple words , - ' Victory or Westminster Abbey . ' "
230585	230593	230595	230595	Kenelm	261	" Admirably expressed , my dear father , "
230599	230615	230617	230618	Sir Peter	421	" I agree with your remark , which I overheard , on Gordon 's speech , "
230620	230679	230617	230618	Sir Peter	421	" It was wonderfully clever ; yet I should have been sorry to hear you speak it . It is not by such sentiments that Nelsons become great . If such sentiments should ever be national , the cry will not be ' Victory or Westminster Abbey ! ' but ' Defeat and the Three per Cents ! ' "
231028	231034	231036	231036	Kenelm	261	" How strange it is , "
231044	231149	231036	231036	Kenelm	261	" that throughout all my desultory wanderings I have ever been attracted towards the sight and the sound of running waters , even those of the humblest rill ! Of what thoughts , of what dreams , of what memories , colouring the history of my past , the waves of the humblest rill could speak , were the waves themselves not such supreme philosophers , - roused indeed on their surface , vexed by a check to their own course , but so indifferent to all that makes gloom or death to the mortals who think and dream and feel beside their banks . "
231150	231154	231156	231156	Peter	421	" Bless me , "
231160	231214	231156	231156	Peter	421	" the boy has got back to his old vein of humours and melancholies . He has not heard a word I have been saying . Travers is right . He will never do anything in life . Why did I christen him Kenelm ? he might as well have been christened Peter . "
231246	231262	231241	231242	Sir Peter	421	" You have not listened to what I said ; Kenelm , you grieve me . "
231263	231322	231158	231158	himself	421	" Grieve you ! you ! do not say that , Father , dear Father . Listen to you ! Every word you have said has sunk into the deepest deep of my heart . Pardon my foolish , purposeless snatch of talk to myself : it is but my way , only my way , dear Father ! "
231323	231328	231330	231331	Sir Peter	421	" Boy , boy , "
231339	231543	231330	231331	Sir Peter	421	" if you could get out of those odd ways of yours I should be so thankful . But if you can not , nothing you can do shall grieve me . Only , let me say this ; running waters have had a great charm for you . With a humble rill you associate thoughts , dreams , memories in your past . But now you halt by the stream of the mighty river : before you the senate of an empire wider than Alexander 's ; behind you the market of a commerce to which that of Tyre was a pitiful trade . Look farther down , those squalid hovels , how much there to redeem or to remedy ; and out of sight , but not very distant , the nation 's Walhalla , ' Victory or Westminster Abbey ! ' The humble rill has witnessed your past . Has the mighty river no effect on your future ? The rill keeps no record of your past : shall the river keep no record of your future ? Ah , boy , boy , I see you are dreaming still , - no use talking . Let us go home . "
231544	231652	231158	231158	himself	421	" I was not dreaming , I was telling myself that the time had come to replace the old Kenelm with the new ideas , by a new Kenelm with the Ideas of Old . Ah ! perhaps we must , - at whatever cost to ourselves , - we must go through the romance of life before we clearly detect what is grand in its realities . I can no longer lament that I stand estranged from the objects and pursuits of my race . I have learned how much I have with them in common . I have known love ; I have known sorrow . "
231724	231729	231730	231730	he	261	" Ay , ay , "
231733	231830	231730	231730	he	261	" Victory or Westminster Abbey ! The world is a battle - field in which the worst wounded are the deserters , stricken as they seek to fly , and hushing the groans that would betray the secret of their inglorious hiding - place . The pain of wounds received in the thick of the fight is scarcely felt in the joy of service to some honoured cause , and is amply atoned by the reverence for noble scars . My choice is made . Not that of deserter , that of soldier in the ranks . "
231831	231872	231703	231703	his	261	" It will not be long before you rise from the ranks , my boy , if you hold fast to the Idea of Old , symbolized in the English battle - cry , ' Victory or Westminster Abbey . ' "
