91	96	175	175	Holmes	96	" Penang law- yer . "
111	125	175	175	Holmes	96	" To James Mortimer , M.R.C.S. , from his friends of the C.C.H. , "
134	137	175	175	Holmes	96	" 1884 . "
162	174	175	175	Holmes	96	" Well , Watson , what do you make of it ? "
195	217	185	185	I	0	" How did you know what I was doing ? I believe you have eyes in the back of your head . "
218	241	243	243	he	96	" I have , at least , a well - polished , silver - plated coffee - pot in front of me , "
245	301	243	243	he	96	" But , tell me , Watson , what do you make of our visitor 's stick ? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand , this accidental souvenir becomes of importance . Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it . "
302	306	308	308	I	0	" I think , "
322	350	308	308	I	0	" that Dr. Mortimer is a successful , elderly medical man , well - esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation . "
351	354	356	356	Holmes	96	" Good ! "
358	361	356	356	Holmes	96	" Excellent ! "
362	389	308	308	I	0	" I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot . "
390	394	356	356	Holmes	96	" Why so ? "
395	447	308	308	I	0	" Because this stick , though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it . The thick - iron ferrule is worn down , so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it . "
448	452	454	454	Holmes	96	" Perfectly sound ! "
456	505	308	308	I	0	" And then again , there is the ' friends of the C.C.H. ' I should guess that to be the Something Hunt , the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance , and which has made him a small presentation in return . "
506	515	517	517	Holmes	96	" Really , Watson , you excel yourself , "
528	608	517	517	Holmes	96	" I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities . It may be that you are not yourself luminous , but you are a conductor of light . Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it . I confess , my dear fellow , that I am very much in your debt . "
734	740	742	742	he	96	" Interesting , though elementary , "
754	775	742	742	he	96	" There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick . It gives us the basis for several deductions . "
776	782	783	783	I	0	" Has anything escaped me ? "
790	804	783	783	I	0	" I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked ? "
805	875	742	742	he	96	" I am afraid , my dear Watson , that most of your conclusions were erroneous . When I said that you stimulated me I meant , to be frank , that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth . Not that you are entirely wrong in this in- stance . The man is certainly a country practitioner . And he walks a good deal . "
876	882	783	783	I	0	" Then I was right . "
883	888	742	742	he	96	" To that extent . "
889	895	783	783	I	0	" But that was all . "
896	963	742	742	he	96	" No , no , my dear Watson , not all - by no means all . I would suggest , for example , that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt , and that when the initials ' C.C. ' are placed before that hospital the words ' Charing Cross ' very naturally suggest themselves . "
964	970	783	783	I	0	" You may be right . "
971	1004	742	742	he	96	" The probability lies in that direction . And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor . "
1005	1031	783	783	I	0	" Well , then , supposing that ' C.C.H. ' does stand for ' Charing Cross Hospital , ' what further inferences may we draw ? "
1032	1046	742	742	he	96	" Do none suggest themselves ? You know my methods . Apply them ! "
1047	1069	783	783	I	0	" I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country . "
1070	1191	742	742	he	96	" I think that we might venture a little farther than this . Look at it in this light . On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made ? When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will ? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start in practice for himself . We know there has been a presentation . We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice . Is it , then , stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change ? "
1192	1198	783	783	I	0	" It certainly seems probable . "
1199	1360	742	742	he	96	" Now , you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of ohe hospital , since only a man well - established in a London practice could hold such a position , and such a one would not drift into the country . What was he , then ? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house - surpeon or a house - physician - little more than a senior student . And he left five years ago - the date is on the stick . So your grave , middle - aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air , my dear Watson , and there emerges a young fellow under thirty , amiable , unambitious , absent - minded , and the possessor of a favourite dog , which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff . "
1384	1399	1401	1401	I	0	" As to the latter part , I have no means of checking you , "
1403	1426	1401	1401	I	0	" but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man 's age and professional career . "
1464	1476	1458	1458	I	0	" Mortimer , James , M.R.C.S. , 1882 , Grimpen , Dartmoor ,
1561	1561	1807	1807	his	200	"
1562	1572	1574	1574	Holmes	96	" No mention of that local hunt , Watson , "
1580	1682	1574	1574	Holmes	96	" but a country doctor , as you very astutely observed . I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences . As to the adjectives , I said , if I remember right , amiable , unambi- tious , and absent - minded . It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials , only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country , and only an absent - minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting - card after waiting an hour in your room . "
1683	1688	1807	1807	his	200	" And the dog ? "
1689	1777	1778	1778	He	200	" Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master . Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle , and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible . The dog 's jaw , as shown in the space between these marks , is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff . It may have been - yes , by Jove , it is a curly - haired spaniel . "
1816	1831	1810	1810	I	0	" My dear fellow , how can you possibly be so sure of that ? "
1832	1947	1807	1807	his	200	" For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door - step , and there is the ring of its owner . Do n't move , I beg you , Watson . He is a professional brother of yours , and your presence may be of assistance to me . Now is the dramatic moment of fate , Watson , when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life , and you know not whether for good or ill . What does Dr. James Mortimer , the man of science , ask of Sherlock Holmes , the specialist in crime ? Come in ! "
2087	2094	2096	2096	he	204	" I am so very glad , "
2098	2125	2077	2077	he	204	" I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office . I would not lose that stick for the world . "
2126	2133	2135	2135	Holmes	96	" A presentation , I see , "
2137	2142	2077	2077	he	204	" Yes , sir . "
2143	2149	2077	2077	he	204	" From Charing Cross Hospital ? "
2150	2164	2077	2077	he	204	" From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage . "
2165	2174	2176	2176	Holmes	96	" Dear , dear , that 's bad ! "
2192	2198	2077	2077	he	204	" Why was it bad ? "
2199	2215	2077	2077	he	204	" Only that you have disarranged our little deductions . Your marriage , you say ? "
2216	2251	2077	2077	he	204	" Yes , sir . I married , and so left the hospital , and with it all hopes of a consulting practice . It was necessary to make a home of my own . "
2252	2267	2269	2269	Holmes	96	" Come , come , we are not so far wrong , after all , "
2271	2279	2269	2269	Holmes	96	" And now , Dr. James Mortimer - "
2280	2290	2077	2077	he	204	" Mister , sir , Mister - a humble M.R.C.S. "
2291	2301	2269	2269	Holmes	96	" And a man of precise mind , evidently . "
2302	2340	2077	2077	he	204	" A dabbler in science , Mr. Holmes , a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean . I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not - "
2341	2351	2269	2269	Holmes	96	" No , this is my friend Dr. Watson . "
2352	2457	2077	2077	he	204	" Glad to meet you , sir . I have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend . You interest me very much , Mr. Holmes . I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well - marked supra - orbital development . Would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure ? A cast of your skull , sir , until the original is available , would be an ornament to any anthropological museum . It is not my intention to be fulsome , but I confess that I covet your skull . "
2468	2490	2492	2492	he	96	" You are an enthusiast in your line of thought , I perceive , sir , as I am in mine , "
2494	2514	2492	2492	he	96	" I observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes . Have no hesitation in lighting one . "
2573	2579	2581	2581	he	96	" I presume , sir , "
2585	2616	2581	2581	he	96	" that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again to - day ? "
2617	2688	2557	2557	his	96	" No , sir , no ; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well . I came to you , Mr. Holmes , because I recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary prob- lem . Recognizing , as I do , that you are the second highest expert in Europe - "
2689	2706	2708	2708	Holmes	96	" Indeed , sir ! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first ? "
2713	2732	2557	2557	his	96	" To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Mon- sieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly . "
2733	2742	2557	2557	his	96	" Then had you not better consult him ? "
2743	2781	2557	2557	his	96	" I said , sir , to the precisely scientific mind . But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone . I trust , sir , that I have not inadvertently - "
2782	2787	2789	2789	Holmes	96	" Just a little , "
2791	2827	2789	2789	Holmes	96	" I think , Dr. Mortimer , you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance . "
2835	2844	2846	2848	Dr. James Mortimer	94	" I have in my pocket a manuscript , "
2850	2860	2862	2862	Holmes	96	" I observed it as you entered the room , "
2864	2871	2557	2557	his	96	" It is an old manuscript . "
2872	2883	2964	2965	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Early eighteenth century , unless it is a forgery . "
2884	2893	2557	2557	his	96	" How can you say that , sir ? "
2894	2955	2964	2965	Dr. Mortimer	94	" You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking . It would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so . You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject . I put that at 1730 . "
2956	2963	2557	2557	his	96	" The exact date is 1742 . "
2974	3066	2969	2969	his	94	" This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville , whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire . I may say that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant . He was a strong - minded man , sir , shrewd , practical , and as unimaginative as I am myself . Yet he took this document very seriously , and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him . "
3082	3114	3079	3079	his	96	" You will observe , Watson , the alternative use of the long s and the short . It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date . "
3135	3139	3115	3115	I	0	" Baskerville Hall , "
3148	3151	3115	3115	I	0	" 1742 . "
3152	3163	3115	3115	I	0	" It appears to be a statement of some sort . "
3164	3182	3115	3115	I	0	" Yes , it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville family . "
3183	3203	3115	3115	I	0	" But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me ? "
3204	3248	3115	3115	I	0	" Most modern . A most practical , pressing matter , which must be decided within twenty - four hours . But the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair . With your permission I will read it to you . "
3300	4888	3275	3276	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many statements , yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville , and as I had the story from my father , who also had it from his , I have set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth . And I would have you believe , my sons , that the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it , and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed . Learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past , but rather to be circumspect in the future , that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing . Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion the history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend to your attention this Manor of Basker- ville was held by Hugo of that name , nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild , profane , and godless man . This , in truth , his neighbours might have pardoned , seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts , but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by- word through the West . It chanced that this Hugo came to love if , indeed , so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate . But the young maiden , being discreet and of good repute , would ever avoid him , for she feared his evil name . So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo , with five or six of his idle and wicked compan- ions , stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden , her father and brothers being from home , as he well knew . When they had brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber , while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse , as was their nightly custom . Now , the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below , for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville , when he was in wine , were such as might blast the man who said them . At last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man , for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered and still covers the south wall she came down from under the eaves , and so homeward across the moor , there being three leagues betwixt the Hall and her father 's farm . It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests to carry food and drink - with other worse things , perchance - to his captive , and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped . Then , as it would seem , he became as one that hath a devil , for , rushing down the stairs into the dining - hall , he sprang upon the great table , flagons and trenchers flying before him , and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the wench . And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man , one more wicked or , it may be , more drunken than the rest , cried out that they should put the hounds upon her Whereat Hugo ran from the house , crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack , and giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid 's , he swung them to the line , and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor . Now , for some space the revellers stood agape , unable to understand all that had been done in such haste . But anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done upon the moorlands . Everything was now in an uproar , some calling for their pistols , some for their horses , and some for another flask of wine . But at length some sense came back to their crazed minds , and the whole of them , thirteen in number , took horse and started in pursuit . The moon shone clear above them , and they rode swiftly abreast , taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home . They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherds upon the moorlands , and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt . And the man , as the story goes , was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak , but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden , with the hounds upon her track . ' But I have seen more than that , ' said he , ' for Hugo Baskerville passed me upon his black mare , and there ran mute behind him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels . ' So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward . But soon their skins turned cold , for there came a galloping across the moor , and the black mare , dabbled with white froth , went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle . Then the revellers rode close together , for a great fear was on them , but they still followed over the moor , though each , had he been alone , would have been right glad to have turned his horse 's head . Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last upon the hounds . These , though known for their valour and their breed , were whim- pering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal , as we call it , upon the moor , some slinking away and some , with starting hackles and staring eyes , gazing down the narrow valley before them . The company had come to a halt , more sober men , as you may guess , than when they started . The most of them would by no means advance , but three of them , the boldest , or it may be the most drunken , rode forward down the goyal . Now , it opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great stones , still to be seen there , which were set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old . The moon was shining bright upon the clearing , and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen , dead of fear and of fatigue . But it was not the sight of her body , nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerviile lying near her , which raised the hair upon the heads of these three dare- devil roysterers , but it was that , standing over Hugo , and plucking at his throat , there stood a foul thing , a great , black beast , shaped like a hound , yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon . And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville , on which , as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them , the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life , still screaming , across the moor . One , it is said , died that very night of what he had seen , and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days . Such is the tale , my sons , of the coming of the hound which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since . If I have set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed . Nor can it be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths , which have been sudden , bloody , and mysterious . Yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence , which would not for- ever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth genera- tion which is threatened in Holy Writ . To that Providence , my sons , I hereby commend you , and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted . This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John , with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister Elizabeth . "
4929	4932	4934	4934	he	94	" Well ? "
4936	4944	4954	4955	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Do you not find it interesting ? "
4945	4953	4954	4955	Dr. Mortimer	94	" To a collector of fairy tales . "
4965	5019	4954	4955	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Now , Mr. Holmes , we will give you something a little more recent . This is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year . It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that date . "
5040	5049	5032	5033	Our visitor	187	" The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville ,
5302	5311	5252	5252	his	100	" The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles
5511	5522	5489	5491	Dr. James Mortimer	94	" The facts of the case are simple . Sir Charles Baskerville
6058	6058	6059	6060	Dr. Mortimer	94	"
6071	6091	6059	6060	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Those are the public facts , Mr. Holmes , in connection with the death of Sir Charles Baskerville . "
6092	6098	6100	6101	Sherlock Holmes	96	" I must thank you , "
6103	6172	6100	6101	Sherlock Holmes	96	" for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest . I had observed some newspaper comment at the time , but I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos , and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases . This article , you say , contains all the public facts ? "
6173	6177	6059	6060	Dr. Mortimer	94	" It does . "
6178	6187	6188	6188	He	94	" Then let me have the private ones . "
6208	6213	6215	6216	Dr. Mortimer	94	" In doing so , "
6229	6345	6215	6216	Dr. Mortimer	94	" I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone . My motive for withholding it from the coroner 's inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition . I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall , as the paper says , would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation . For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew , since no practical good could result from it , but with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank .
6346	6467	6059	6060	Dr. Mortimer	94	" The moor is very sparsely inhabited , and those who live near each other are thrown very much together . For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville . With the exception of Mr. Frankland , of Lafter Hall , and Mr. Stapleton , the naturalist , there are no other men of education within many miles . Sir Charles was a retiring man , but the chance of his illness brought us together , and a community of interests in science kept us so . He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa , and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot .
6468	6636	6215	6216	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir Charles 's nervous system was strained to the break- ing point . He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart - so much so that , although he would walk in his own grounds , nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night . Incredible as it may appear to you , Mr. Holmes , he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family , and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging . The idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him , and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound . The latter question he put to me several times , and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement .
6637	6861	6059	6060	Dr. Mortimer	94	" I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event . He chanced to be at his hall door . I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him , when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror . I whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive . So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it . It was gone , however , and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind . I stayed with him all the evening , and it was on that occasion , to explain the emotion which he had shown , that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came . I mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed , but I was convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excite- ment had no justification .
6862	6965	6215	6216	Dr. Mortimer	94	" It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London . His heart was , I knew , affected , and the constant anxi- ety in which he lived , however chimerical the cause of it might be , was evidently having a serious effect upon his health . I thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man . Mr. Stapleton , a mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health , was of the same opinion . At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe .
6966	7196	6059	6060	Dr. Mortimer	94	" On the night of Sir Charles 's death Barrymore the butler who made the discovery , sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me , and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event . I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest . I followed the footsteps down the yew alley , I saw the spot at the moor - gate where he seemed to have waited , I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point , I noted that there were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel , and finally I carefully examined the body , which had not been touched until my arrival . Sir Charles lay on his face , his arms out , his fingers dug into the ground , and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity . TheFe was certainly no physical injury of any kind . But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the inquest . He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body . He did not observe any . But I did - some little distance off , but fresh and clear . "
7197	7200	6215	6216	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Footprints ? "
7201	7204	6059	6060	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Footprints . "
7205	7214	6215	6216	Dr. Mortimer	94	" A man 's or a woman 's ? "
7237	7250	7234	7234	he	94	" Mr. Holmes , they were the footprints of a gigantic hound ! "
7315	7320	7297	7297	his	96	" You saw this ? "
7321	7329	7271	7272	the doctor	248	" As clearly as I see you . "
7330	7336	7297	7297	his	96	" And you said nothing ? "
7337	7343	7271	7272	the doctor	248	" What was the use ? "
7344	7355	7297	7297	his	96	" How was it that no one else saw it ? "
7356	7390	7271	7272	the doctor	248	" The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a thought . I do n't suppose I should have done so had I not known this legend . "
7391	7402	7297	7297	his	96	" There are many sheep - dogs on the moor ? "
7403	7415	7271	7272	the doctor	248	" No doubt , but this was no sheep - dog . "
7416	7423	7297	7297	his	96	" You say it was large ? "
7424	7427	7271	7272	the doctor	248	" Enormous . "
7428	7437	7297	7297	his	96	" But it had not approached the body ? "
7438	7441	7271	7272	the doctor	248	" No . "
7442	7450	7297	7297	his	96	" What sort of night was it ? '
7451	7456	7271	7272	the doctor	248	" Damp and raw . "
7457	7463	7297	7297	his	96	" But not actually raining ? "
7464	7467	7271	7272	the doctor	248	" No . "
7468	7475	7297	7297	his	96	" What is the alley like ? "
7476	7489	7271	7272	the doctor	248	" There are two lines of old yew hedge , twelve feet high and
7503	7503	7297	7297	his	96	"
7504	7515	7297	7297	his	96	" Is there anything between the hedges and the walk ? "
7516	7533	7297	7297	his	96	" Yes , there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side . "
7534	7550	7297	7297	his	96	" I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate ? "
7551	7565	7297	7297	his	96	" Yes , the wicket - gate which leads on to the moor . "
7566	7573	7297	7297	his	96	" Is there any other opening ? "
7574	7577	7297	7297	his	96	" None . "
7578	7607	7297	7297	his	96	" So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor - gate ? "
7608	7623	7297	7297	his	96	" There is an exit through a summer - house at the far end . "
7624	7631	7297	7297	his	96	" Had Sir Charles reached this ? "
7632	7643	7297	7297	his	96	" No ; he lay about fifty yards from it . "
7644	7658	7297	7297	his	96	" Now , tell me , Dr. Mortimer - and this is important - the
7673	7673	7297	7297	his	96	"
7674	7683	7297	7297	his	96	" No marks could show on the grass . "
7684	7700	7297	7297	his	96	" Were they on the same side of the path as the moor - gate ? "
7701	7722	7297	7297	his	96	" Yes ; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor - gate . "
7723	7738	7297	7297	his	96	" You interest me exceedingly . Another point . Was the wicket- gate closed ? "
7739	7744	7297	7297	his	96	" Closed and padlocked . "
7745	7751	7297	7297	his	96	" How high was it ? "
7752	7758	7297	7297	his	96	" About four feet high . "
7759	7768	7297	7297	his	96	" Then anyone could have got over it ? "
7769	7772	7297	7297	his	96	" Yes . "
7773	7786	7297	7297	his	96	" And what marks did you see by the wicket - gate ? "
7787	7792	7297	7297	his	96	" None in particular . "
7793	7802	7297	7297	his	96	" Good heaven ! Did no one examine ? "
7803	7811	7297	7297	his	96	" Yes , I examined , myself . "
7812	7817	7297	7297	his	96	" And found nothing ? "
7818	7837	7297	7297	his	96	" It was all very confused . Sir Charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes . "
7838	7845	7297	7297	his	96	" How do you know that ? "
7846	7857	7297	7297	his	96	" Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar . "
7858	7877	7297	7297	his	96	" Excellent ! This is a colleague , Watson , after our own heart . But the marks ? "
7878	7899	7297	7297	his	96	" He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel . I could discern no others . "
7913	7921	7922	7922	he	96	" If I had only been there ! "
7925	8003	7922	7922	he	96	" It is evidently a case of extraordinary interest , and one which presented immense opportu- nities to the scientific expert . That gravel page upon which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants . Oh , Dr. Mortimer , Dr. Mortimer , to think that you should not have called me in ! You have indeed much to answer for . "
8004	8041	7297	7297	his	96	" I could not call you in , Mr. Holmes , without disclosing these facts to the world , and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so . Besides , besides - "
8042	8048	7922	7922	he	96	" Why do you hesitate ? "
8049	8068	7297	7297	his	96	" There is a realm in which the most acute and most experi- enced of detectives is helpless . "
8069	8078	7922	7922	he	96	" You mean that the thing is supernatural ? "
8079	8087	7297	7297	his	96	" I did not positively say so . "
8088	8097	7922	7922	he	96	" No , but you evidently think it . "
8098	8126	7297	7297	his	96	" Since the tragedy , Mr. Holmes , there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature . "
8127	8131	7922	7922	he	96	" For example ? "
8132	8264	7297	7297	his	96	" I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon , and which could not possibly be any animal known to science . They all agreed that it was a huge creature , luminous , ghastly , and spectral . I have cross - examined these men , one of them a hard - headed countryman , one a farrier , and one a moorland farmer , who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition , exactly corresponding to the hell - hound of the legend . I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district , and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night . "
8265	8282	7922	7922	he	96	" And you , a trained man of science , believe it to be super- natural ? "
8283	8292	7297	7297	his	96	" I do not know what to believe . "
8298	8309	8311	8311	he	96	" I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world , "
8313	8352	8311	8311	he	96	" In a modest way I have combated evil , but to take on the Father of Evil himself would , perhaps , be too ambitious a task . Yet you must admit that the footmark is material . "
8353	8376	7922	7922	he	96	" The original hound was material enough to tug a man 's throat out , and yet he was diabolical as well . "
8377	8442	8311	8311	he	96	" I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists . But now , Dr. Mortimer , tell me this . If you hold these views why have you come to consult me at all ? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles 's death , and that you desire me to do it . "
8443	8456	7922	7922	he	96	" I did not say that I desired you to do it . "
8457	8466	8311	8311	he	96	" Then , how can I assist you ? "
8467	8487	8489	8490	Dr. Mortimer	94	" By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville , who arrives at Waterloo Station "
8496	8505	8311	8311	he	96	" in exactly one hour and a quarter . "
8506	8512	8311	8311	he	96	" He being the heir ? "
8513	8574	8311	8311	he	96	" Yes . On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada . From the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way . I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles 's will . "
8575	8585	8311	8311	he	96	" There is no other claimant , I presume ? "
8586	8745	8311	8311	he	96	" None . The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger Baskerville , the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was the elder . The second brother , who died young , is the father of this lad Henry . The third , Rodger , was the black sheep of the family . He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image , they tell me , of the family picture of old Hugo . He made England too hot to hold him , fled to Central America , and died there in 1876 of yellow fever . Henry is the last of the Baskervilles . In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station . I have had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning . Now , Mr. Holmes , what would you advise me to do with him ? "
8746	8759	8311	8311	he	96	" Why should he not go to the home of his fathers ? "
8760	8909	8311	8311	he	96	" It seems natural , does it not ? And yet , consider that every Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate . I feel sure that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this , the last of the old race , and the heir to great wealth , to that deadly place . And yet it can not be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor , bleak countryside depends upon his presence . All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall . I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter , and that is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice . "
8917	8928	8930	8930	he	96	" Put into plain words , the matter is this , "
8932	8956	8930	8930	he	96	" In your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a Baskerville - that is your opinion ? "
8957	8978	8311	8311	he	96	" At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so . "
8979	9024	8930	8930	he	96	" Exactly . But surely , if your supernatural theory be correct , it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire . A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing . "
9025	9088	8311	8311	he	96	" You put the matter more flippantly , Mr. Holmes , than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things . Your advice , then , as I understand it , is that the young man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London . He comes in fifty minutes . What would you recommend ? "
9089	9123	8930	8930	he	96	" I recommend , sir , that you take a cab , call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door , and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry Baskerville . "
9124	9128	8311	8311	he	96	" And then ? "
9129	9151	8930	8930	he	96	" And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my mind about the matter . "
9152	9165	8311	8311	he	96	" How long will it take you to make up your mind ? "
9166	9222	8930	8930	he	96	" Twenty - four hours . At ten o'clock to - morrow , Dr. Morti- mer , I will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here , and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry Baskerville with you . "
9223	9232	8311	8311	he	96	" I will do so , Mr. Holmes . "
9265	9292	8930	8930	he	96	" Only one more question , Dr. Mortimer . You say that before Sir Charles Baskerville 's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor ? "
9293	9298	9255	9255	Holmes	96	" Three people did . "
9299	9306	8930	8930	he	96	" Did any see it after ? "
9307	9315	9255	9255	Holmes	96	" I have not heard of any . "
9316	9324	8930	8930	he	96	" Thank you . Good - morning . "
9348	9354	9255	9255	Holmes	96	" Going out , Watson ? "
9355	9362	9255	9255	Holmes	96	" Unless I can help you . "
9363	9463	9255	9255	Holmes	96	" No , my dear fellow , it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for aid . But this is splendid , really unique from some points of view . When you pass Bradley 's , would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco ? Thank you . It would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening . Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submined to us this morning . "
9662	9668	9670	9670	he	96	" Caught cold , Watson ? "
9672	9681	9670	9670	he	96	" No , it 's this poisonous atmosphere . "
9682	9696	9744	9744	He	96	" I suppose it is pretty thick , now that you mention it . "
9697	9704	9670	9670	he	96	" Thick ! It is intolerable . "
9705	9724	9744	9744	He	96	" Open the window , then ! You have been at your club all day , I perceive . "
9725	9730	9670	9670	he	96	" My dear Holmes ! "
9731	9736	9744	9744	He	96	" Am I right ? "
9737	9743	9670	9670	he	96	" Certainly , but how ? "
9751	9839	9744	9744	He	96	" There is a delightful freshness about you , Watson , which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense . A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day . He returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots . He has been a fixture therefore all day . He is not a man with intimate friends . Where , then , could he have been ? Is it not obvious ? "
9840	9848	9744	9744	He	96	" Well , it is rather obvious . "
9849	9874	9744	9744	He	96	" The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes . Where do you think that I have been ? "
9875	9880	9744	9744	He	96	" A fixture also . "
9881	9892	9744	9744	He	96	" On the contrary , I have been to Devonshire . "
9893	9897	9744	9744	He	96	" In spirit ? "
9898	9973	9744	9744	He	96	" Exactly . My body has remained in this armchair and has , I regret to observe , consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco . After you left I sent down to Stamford 's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor , and my spirit has hovered over it all day . I flatter myself that I could find my way about . "
9974	9984	9744	9744	He	96	" A large - scale map , I presume ? "
9985	9989	9990	9990	He	269	" Very large . "
10001	10020	9998	9998	his	269	" Here you have the particular district which concerns us . That is Baskerville Hall in the middle . "
10021	10028	9744	9744	He	96	" With a wood round it ? "
10029	10206	9998	9998	his	269	" Exactly . I fancy the yew alley , though not marked under that name , must stretch along this line , with the moor , as you per- ceive , upon the right of it . This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen , where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters . Within a radius of five miles there are , as you see , only a very few scattered dwellings . Here is Lafter Hall , which was mentioned in the narrative . There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist - Stapleton , if I remember right , was his name . Here are two moorland farm- houses , High Tor and Foulmire . Then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of Princetown . Between and around these scattered points extends the desolate , lifeless moor . This , then , is the stage upon which tragedy has been played , and upon which we may help to play it again . "
10207	10215	9744	9744	He	96	" It must be a wild place . "
10216	10241	9998	9998	his	269	" Yes , the setting is a worthy one . If the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men - "
10242	10253	9744	9744	He	96	" Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation . "
10254	10426	9998	9998	his	269	" The devil 's agents may be of flesh and blood , may they not ? There are two questions waiting for us at the outset . The one is whether any crime has been committed at all ; the second is , what is the crime and how was it committed ? Of course , if Dr. Mortimer 's surmise should be correct , and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature , there is an end of our investigation . But we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one . I think we 'll shut that window again , if you do n't mind . It is a singular thing , but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought . I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think , but that is the logical outcome of my convictions . Have you turned the case over in your mind ? "
10427	10445	9744	9744	He	96	" Yes , I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day . "
10446	10454	9998	9998	his	269	" What do you make of it ? "
10455	10461	9744	9744	He	96	" It is very bewildering . "
10462	10496	9998	9998	his	269	" It has certainly a character of its own . There are points of distinction about it . That change in the footprints , for example . What do you make of that ? "
10497	10514	9744	9744	He	96	" Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley . "
10515	10538	9998	9998	his	269	" He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest Why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley ? "
10539	10543	9744	9744	He	96	" What then ? "
10544	10573	9998	9998	his	269	" He was running , Watson - running desperately , running for his life , running until he burst his heart - and fell dead upon his face . "
10574	10579	9744	9744	He	96	" Running from what ? "
10580	10603	9998	9998	his	269	" There lies our problem . There are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run . "
10604	10611	9744	9744	He	96	" How can you say that ? "
10612	10716	9998	9998	his	269	" I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor . If that were so , and it seems most probable only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it . If the gipsy 's evidence may be taken as true , he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be . Then , again , whom was he waiting for that night , and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house ? "
10717	10727	9744	9744	He	96	" You think that he was waiting for someone ? "
10728	10791	9998	9998	his	269	" The man was elderly and infirm . We can understand his taking an evening stroll , but the ground was damp and the night inclement . Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes , as Dr. Mortimer , with more practical sense than I should have given him credit for , deduced from the cigar ash ? "
10792	10800	9744	9744	He	96	" But he went out every evening . "
10801	10897	9998	9998	his	269	" I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor - gate every evening . On the contrary , the evidence is that he avoided the moor . That night he waited there . It was the night before he made his departure for London . The thing takes shape , Watson . It becomes coherent . Might I ask you to hand me my violin , and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning . "
11035	11042	11044	11045	Dr. Mortimer	94	" This is Sir Henry Baskerville , "
11047	11052	11054	11054	he	94	" Why , yes , "
11056	11119	11054	11054	he	94	" and the strange thing is , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning I should have come on my own account . I understand that you think out little puzzles , and I 've had one this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give it . "
11120	11149	11188	11188	He	276	" Pray take a seat , Sir Henry . Do I understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London ? "
11150	11187	11054	11054	he	94	" Nothing of much importance , Mr. Holmes . Only a joke , as like as not . It was this letter , if you can call it a letter , which reached me this morning . "
11216	11224	11353	11353	he	248	" Sir Henry Baskerville , Northumberland Hotel , "
11235	11239	11188	11188	He	276	" Charing Cross , "
11249	11262	11264	11264	Holmes	96	" Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Ho- tel ? "
11273	11289	11353	11353	he	248	" No one could have known . We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer . "
11290	11301	11353	11353	he	248	" But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there ? "
11302	11313	11315	11316	the doctor	248	" No , I had been staying with a friend , "
11318	11333	11315	11316	the doctor	248	" There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel . "
11334	11348	11353	11353	he	248	" Hum ! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements . "
11417	11419	11642	11642	He	96	" moor "
11426	11429	11431	11433	Sir Henry Baskerville	115	" Now , "
11435	11467	11431	11433	Sir Henry Baskerville	115	" perhaps you will tell me , Mr. Holmes , what in thunder is the meaning of that , and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs ? "
11468	11494	11642	11642	He	96	" What do you make of it , Dr. Mortimer ? You must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this , at any rate ? "
11495	11517	11431	11433	Sir Henry Baskerville	115	" No , sir , but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural . "
11518	11522	11524	11525	Sir Henry	115	" What business ? "
11528	11550	11524	11525	Sir Henry	115	" It seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs . "
11551	11571	11573	11574	Sherlock Holmes	96	" You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room , Sir Henry . I promise you that , "
11576	11612	11573	11574	Sherlock Holmes	96	" We will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document , which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening . Have you yesterday 's Times , Watson ? "
11613	11621	11431	11433	Sir Henry Baskerville	115	" It is here in the corner . "
11622	11641	11642	11642	He	96	" Might I trouble you for it - the inside page , please , with the leading articles ? "
11657	11674	11649	11649	his	96	" Capital article this on free trade . Permit me to give you an extract from it .
11675	11685	11649	11649	his	96	" You may be cajoled into imagining that your own spe-
11738	11748	11750	11750	Holmes	96	" What do you think of that , Watson ? "
11762	11773	11756	11756	his	96	" Do n't you think that is an admirable sentiment ? "
11800	11815	11817	11817	he	115	" I do n't know much about the tariff and things of that kind , "
11819	11841	11817	11817	he	115	" but it seems to me we 've got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned . "
11842	11887	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" On the contrary , I think we are particularly hot upon the trail , Sir Henry . Watson here knows more about my methods than you do , but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence . "
11888	11899	11817	11817	he	115	" No , I confess that I see no connection . "
11900	11972	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" And yet , my dear Watson , there is so very close a connec- tion that the one is extracted out of the other . ' You , ' ' your , ' ' your , ' ' life , ' ' reason , ' ' value , ' ' keep away , ' ' from the . ' Do n't you see now whence these words have been taken ? "
11973	11989	11991	11992	Sir Henry	115	" By thunder , you 're right ! Well , if that is n't smart ! "
11994	12023	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that ' keep away ' and ' from the ' are cut out in one piece . "
12024	12033	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Well , now - so it is ! "
12034	12049	12051	12052	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Really , Mr. Holmes , this exceeds anything which I could have imagined , "
12061	12112	12051	12052	Dr. Mortimer	94	" I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper ; but that you should name which , and add that it came from the leading article , is really one of the most remarkable things which I have ever known . How did you do it ? "
12113	12134	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" I presume , Doctor , that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an Esquimau ? "
12135	12139	12051	12052	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Most certainly . "
12140	12144	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" But how ? "
12145	12175	12051	12052	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Because that is my special hobby . The differences are obvi- ous . The supra - orbital crest , the facial angle , the maxillary curve , the - "
12176	12311	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" But this is my special hobby , and the differences are equally obvious . There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half - penny paper as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau . The detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime , though I confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News . But a Times leader is entirely distinctive , and these words could have been taken from nothing else . As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yester- day 's issue . "
12312	12326	12328	12330	Sir Henry Baskerville	115	" So far as I can follow you , then , Mr. Holmes , "
12342	12342	12333	12333	someone	1746	"
12343	12348	12350	12350	Holmes	96	" Nail - scissors , "
12352	12380	12350	12350	Holmes	96	" You can see that it was a very short - bladed scissors , since the cutter had to take two snips over ' keep away . ' "
12381	12408	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" That is so . Someone , then , cut out the message with a pair of short - bladed scissors , pasted it with paste - "
12409	12412	12414	12414	Holmes	96	" Gum , "
12416	12440	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" With gum on to the paper . But I want to know why the word ' moor ' should have been written ? "
12441	12474	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Because he could not find it in print . The other words were all simple and might be found in any issue , but ' moor ' would be less common . "
12475	12499	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Why , of course , that would explain it . Have you read any- thing else in this message , Mr. Holmes ? "
12500	12744	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" There are one or two indications , and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues . The address , you observe is printed in rough characters . But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated . We may take it , therefore , that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one , and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known , or come to be known , by you . Again , you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line , but that some are much higher than others . ' Life , ' for example is quite out of its proper place . That may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter . On the whole I incline to the latter view , since the matter was evidently important , and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless . If he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry , since any letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel . Did the composer fear an interruption - and from whom ? "
12745	12757	12759	12760	Dr. Mortimer	94	" We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork , "
12762	12831	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Say , rather , into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely . It is the scientific use of the imagina- tion , but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation . Now , you would call it a guess , no doubt , but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel . "
12832	12842	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" How in the world can you say that ? "
12843	13003	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble . The pen has spluttered twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short address , showing that there was very little ink in the bottle . Now , a private pen or ink - bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state , and the combination of the two must be quite rare . But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen , where it is rare to get anything else . Yes , I have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the waste - paper baskets of the hotels around Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message . Halloa ! Halloa ! What 's this ? "
13029	13032	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Well ? "
13033	13036	13038	13038	he	289	" Nothing , "
13044	13099	13038	13038	he	289	" It is a blank half- sheet of paper , without even a water - mark upon it . I think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter ; and now , Sir Henry , has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in London ? "
13100	13112	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Why , no , Mr. Holmes . I think not . "
13113	13124	13038	13038	he	289	" You have not observed anyone follow or watch you ? "
13125	13140	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel , "
13145	13156	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me ? "
13157	13179	13038	13038	he	289	" We are coming to that . You have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter ? "
13180	13192	11774	11775	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Well , it depends upon what you think worth reporting . "
13193	13208	13038	13038	he	289	" I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting . "
13213	13261	13038	13038	he	289	" I do n't know much of British life yet , for I have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada . But I hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here . "
13262	13271	13038	13038	he	289	" You have lost one of your boots ? "
13272	13277	13279	13280	Dr. Mortimer	94	" My dear sir , "
13282	13313	13279	13280	Dr. Mortimer	94	" it is only mislaid . You will find it when you return to the hotel . What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind ? "
13314	13327	13038	13038	he	289	" Well , he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine . "
13328	13331	13333	13333	Holmes	96	" Exactly , "
13335	13354	13333	13333	Holmes	96	" however foolish the incident may seem . You have lost one of your boots , you say ? "
13355	13420	13038	13038	he	289	" Well , mislaid it , anyhow . I put them both outside my door last night , and there was only one in the morning . I could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them . The worst of it is that I only bought the pair last night in the Strand , and I have never had them on . "
13421	13439	13333	13333	Holmes	96	" If you have never worn them , why did you put them out to be cleaned ? "
13440	13459	13038	13038	he	289	" They were tan boots and had never been varnished . That was why I put them out . "
13460	13483	13333	13333	Holmes	96	" Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots ? "
13484	13563	13038	13038	he	289	" I did a good deal of shopping . Dr. Mortimer here went round with me . You see , if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part , and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West . Among other things I bought these brown boots - gave six dollars for them - and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet . "
13564	13574	13576	13577	Sherlock Holmes	96	" It seems a singularly useless thing to steal , "
13579	13602	13576	13577	Sherlock Holmes	96	" I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer 's belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found . "
13603	13610	13612	13613	the baronet	292	" And , now , gentlemen , "
13617	13657	13612	13613	the baronet	292	" it seems to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know . It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all driving at . "
13658	13667	13668	13668	Holmes	96	" Your request is a very reasonable one , "
13671	13694	13668	13668	Holmes	96	" Dr. Mortimer , I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us . "
13737	13753	13755	13755	he	294	" Well , I seem to have come into an inheritance with a ven- geance , "
13763	13851	13755	13755	he	294	" Of course , I 've heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery . It 's the pet story of the family , though I never thought of taking it seriously before . But as to my uncle 's death - well , it all seems boiling up in my head , and I ca n't get it clear yet . You do n't seem quite to have made up your mind whether it 's a case for a policeman or a clergyman . "
13852	13855	13903	13904	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Precisely . "
13856	13880	13755	13755	he	294	" And now there 's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel . I suppose that fits into its place . "
13881	13901	13903	13904	Dr. Mortimer	94	" It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor , "
13906	13910	13912	13912	Holmes	96	" And also , "
13914	13932	13912	13912	Holmes	96	" that someone is not ill - disposed towards you , since they warn you of danger . "
13933	13952	13755	13755	he	294	" Or it may be that they wish , for their own purposes , to scare me away . "
13953	14017	13912	13912	Holmes	96	" Well , of course , that is possible also . I am very much indebted to you , Dr. Mortimer , for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives . But the practical point which we now have to decide , Sir Henry , is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall . "
14018	14025	13755	13755	he	294	" Why should I not go ? "
14026	14033	13912	13912	Holmes	96	" There seems to be danger . "
14034	14052	13755	13755	he	294	" Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings ? "
14053	14065	13912	13912	Holmes	96	" Well , that is what we have to find out . "
14066	14118	14119	14119	His	295	" Whichever it is , my answer is fixed . There is no devil in hell , Mr. Holmes , and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people , and you may take that to be my final answer . "
14154	14157	14159	14159	he	295	" Meanwhile , "
14161	14271	14159	14159	he	295	" I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me . It 's a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting . I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind . Now , look here , Mr. Holmes , it 's half - past eleven now and I am going back right away to my hotel.- Suppose you and your friend , Dr. Watson , come round and lunch with us at two . I 'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me . "
14272	14281	14159	14159	he	295	" Is that convenient to you , Watson ? "
14282	14285	14159	14159	he	295	" Perfectly . "
14286	14300	14159	14159	he	295	" Then you may expect us . Shall I have a cab called ? "
14301	14316	14159	14159	he	295	" I 'd prefer to walk , for this affair has flurried me rather . "
14317	14329	14331	14332	his companion	299	" I 'll join you in a walk , with pleasure , "
14334	14350	14159	14159	he	295	" Then we meet again at two o'clock . Au revoir , and good- morning ! "
14385	14401	14402	14402	He	96	" Your hat and boots , Watson , quick ! Not a moment to lose ! "
14458	14467	14511	14511	his	96	" Shall I run on and stop them ? "
14468	14508	14511	14511	his	96	" Not for the world , my dear Watson . I am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine . Our friends are wise , for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk . "
14613	14640	14568	14568	he	96	" There 's our man , Watson ! Come along ! We 'll have a good look at him , if we can do no more . "
14740	14744	14746	14746	Holmes	96	" There now ! "
14762	14797	14749	14749	he	96	" Was ever such bad luck and such bad management , too ? Watson , Watson , if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes ! "
14798	14804	14746	14746	Holmes	96	" Who was the man ? "
14805	14812	14749	14749	he	96	" I have not an idea . "
14813	14817	14746	14746	Holmes	96	" A spy ? "
14818	14904	14749	14749	he	96	" Well , it was evident from what we have heard that Basker- ville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town . How else could it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen ? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the second . You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend . "
14905	14911	14746	14746	Holmes	96	" Yes , I remember . "
14912	15066	14749	14749	he	96	" I was looking out for loiterers in the street , but I saw none . We are dealing with a clever man , Watson . This matter cuts very deep , and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us , I am conscious always of power and design . When our friends left I at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant . So wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot , but he had availed himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice . His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them . It has , however , one obvious disadvantage . "
15067	15078	14746	14746	Holmes	96	" It puts him in the power of the cabman . "
15079	15082	14749	14749	he	96	" Exactly . "
15083	15094	14746	14746	Holmes	96	" What a pity we did not get the number ! "
15095	15138	14749	14749	he	96	" My dear Watson , clumsy as I have been , you surely do not seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number ? No . 2704 is our man . But that is no use to us for the moment . "
15139	15151	14746	14746	Holmes	96	" I fail to see how you could have done more . "
15152	15264	14749	14749	he	96	" On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction . I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance , or , better still , have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there . When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for . As it is , by an indiscreet eagerness , which was taken advantage of with extraor- dinary quickness and energy by our opponent , we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man . "
15293	15303	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" There is no object in our following them , "
15307	15346	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" The shadow has departed and will not return . We must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision . Could you swear to that man 's face within the cab ? "
15347	15356	15420	15421	the manager	319	" I could swear only to the beard . "
15357	15403	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" And so could I - from which I gather that in all probability it was a false one . A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features . Come in here , Watson ! "
15423	15448	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" Ah , Wilson , I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had the good fortune to help you ? "
15449	15470	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" No , sir , indeed I have not . You saved my good name , and perhaps my life . "
15471	15505	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" My dear fellow , you exaggerate . I have some recollection , Wilson , that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright , who showed some ability during the investigation . "
15506	15517	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" Yes , sir , he is still with us . "
15518	15544	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" Could you ring him up ? - thank you ! And I should be glad to have change of this five - pound note . "
15577	15585	15587	15587	Holmes	96	" Let me have the Hotel Directory , "
15589	15621	15587	15587	Holmes	96	" Thank you ! Now , Cartwright , there are the names of twenty - three hotels here , all in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross . Do you see ? "
15622	15627	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" Yes , sir . "
15628	15638	15587	15587	Holmes	96	" You will visit each of these in turn . "
15639	15644	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" Yes , sir . "
15645	15667	15587	15587	Holmes	96	" You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling . Here are twenty - three shillings . "
15668	15673	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" Yes , sir . "
15674	15712	15587	15587	Holmes	96	" You will tell him that you want to see the waste - paper of yesterday . You will say that an important telegram has miscar- ried and that you are looking for it . You understand ? "
15713	15718	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" Yes , sir . "
15719	15766	15587	15587	Holmes	96	" But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times with some holes cut in it with scissors . Here is a copy of the Times . It is this page . You could easily recognize it , could you not ? "
15767	15772	15305	15305	Holmes	96	" Yes , sir . "
15773	15939	15587	15587	Holmes	96	" In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter , to whom also you will give a shilling . Here are twenty - three shillings . You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty - three that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed . In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the Times among it . The odds are enormously against your finding it . There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies . Let me have a report by wire at Baker Street before evening . And now , Watson , it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman , No . 2704 , and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel . "
16026	16035	16037	16038	the clerk	328	" Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you , "
16040	16054	16037	16038	the clerk	328	" He asked me to show you up at once when you came . "
16055	16067	16069	16069	Holmes	127	" Have you any objection to my looking at your register ? "
16071	16077	16037	16038	the clerk	328	" Not in the least . "
16116	16130	16132	16132	Holmes	127	" Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know , "
16137	16154	16132	16132	Holmes	127	" A lawyer , is he not , gray- headed , and walks with a limp ? "
16155	16180	16105	16106	Mrs. Oldmore	129	" No , sir , this is Mr. Johnson , the coal - owner , a very active gentleman , not older than yourself . "
16181	16190	16132	16132	Holmes	127	" Surely you are mistaken about his trade ? "
16191	16214	16105	16106	Mrs. Oldmore	129	" No , sir ! he has used this hotel for many years , and he is very well known to us . "
16215	16249	16132	16132	Holmes	127	" Ah , that settles it . Mrs. Oldmore , too ; I seem to remember the name . Excuse my curiosity , but often in calling upon one friend one finds another . "
16250	16278	16105	16106	Mrs. Oldmore	129	" She is an invalid lady , sir . Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester . She always comes to us when she is in town . "
16279	16307	16308	16308	he	334	" Thank you ; I am afraid I can not claim her acquaintance . We have established a most important fact by these questions , Wat- son , "
16320	16381	16308	16308	he	334	" We know now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down in his own hotel . That means that while they are , as we have seen , very anxious to watch him , they are equally anxious that he should not see them . Now , this is a most suggestive fact . "
16382	16388	16450	16450	he	115	" What does it suggest ? "
16389	16406	16308	16308	he	334	" It suggests - halloa , my dear fellow , what on earth is the matter ? "
16484	16499	16500	16500	he	115	" Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel , "
16503	16563	16500	16500	he	115	" They 'll find they 've stafted in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are careful . By thunder , if that chap ca n't find my missing boot there will be trouble . I can take a joke with the best , Mr. Holmes , but they 've got a bit over the mark this time . "
16564	16571	16459	16459	he	115	" Still looking for your boot ? "
16572	16583	16500	16500	he	115	" Yes , sir , and mean to find it . "
16584	16599	16459	16459	he	115	" But , surely , you said that it was a new brown boot ? "
16600	16616	16500	16500	he	115	" So it was , sir . And now it 's an old black one . "
16617	16627	16459	16459	he	115	" What ! you do n't mean to say ? "
16628	16707	16500	16500	he	115	" That 's just what I do mean to say . I only had three pairs in the world - the new brown , the old black , and the patent leath- ers , which I am wearing . Last night they took one of my brown ones , and to - day they have sneaked one of the black . Well , have you got it ? Speak out , man , and do n't stand staring ! "
16718	16741	16459	16459	he	115	" No , sir ; I have made inquiry all over the hotel , but I can hear no word of it . "
16742	16771	16459	16459	he	115	" Well , either that boot comes back before sundown or I 'll see the manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel . "
16772	16796	16459	16459	he	115	" It shall be found , sir - I promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be found . "
16797	16838	16459	16459	he	115	" Mind it is , for it 's the last thing of mine that I 'll lose in this den of thieves . Well , well , Mr. Holmes , you 'll excuse my troubling you about such a trifle - "
16839	16849	16459	16459	he	115	" I think it 's well worth troubling about . "
16850	16860	16459	16459	he	115	" Why , you look very serious over it . "
16861	16868	16459	16459	he	115	" How do you explain it ? "
16869	16893	16459	16459	he	115	" I just do n't attempt to explain it . It seems the very maddest , queerest thing that ever happened to me . "
16894	16899	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" The queerest perhaps - "
16904	16913	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" What do you make of it yourself ? "
16914	17018	16459	16459	he	115	" Well , I do n't profess to understand it yet . This case of yours is very complex , Sir Henry . When taken in conjunction with your uncle 's death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts so deep . But we hold several threads in our hands , and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth . We may waste time in following the wrong one , but sooner or later we must come upon the right . "
17060	17067	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" To go to Baskerville Hall . "
17068	17072	16459	16459	he	115	" And when ? "
17073	17081	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" At the end of the week . "
17082	17087	17089	17089	Holmes	96	" On the whole , "
17091	17177	17089	17089	Holmes	96	" I think that your decision is a wise one . I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London , and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be . If their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief , and we should be powerless to prevent it . You did not know , Dr. Moftimer , that you were followed this morning from my house ? "
17183	17189	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Followed ! By whom ? "
17190	17221	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" That , unfortunately , is what I can not tell you . Have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on Daftmoor any man with a black , full beard ? "
17222	17252	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" No - or , let me see - why , yes . Barrymore , Sir Charles 's butler , is a man with a full , black beard . "
17253	17260	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Ha ! Where is Baffymore ? "
17261	17270	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" He is in charge of the Hall . "
17271	17293	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" We had best ascertain if he is really there , or if by any possibility he might be in London . "
17294	17301	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" How can you do that ? "
17302	17401	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Give me a telegraph form . ' Is all ready for Sir Henry ? ' That will do . Address to Mr. Barrymore , Baskerville Hall . What is the nearest telegraph - office ? Grimpen . Very good , we will send a second wire to the postmaster , Grimpen : ' Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand . If absent , please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville , Northumberland Hotel . ' That should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not . "
17402	17407	17409	17409	Baskerville	115	" That 's so , "
17411	17426	17409	17409	Baskerville	115	" By the way , Dr. Mortimer , who is this Barrymore , anyhow ? "
17427	17473	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" He is the son of the old caretaker , who is dead . They have looked after the Hall for four generations now . So far as I know , he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the county . "
17474	17480	17482	17482	Baskerville	115	" At the same time , "
17484	17514	17482	17482	Baskerville	115	" it 's clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do . "
17515	17520	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" That is true . "
17521	17533	17535	17535	Holmes	96	" Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles 's will ? "
17537	17548	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" He and his wife had five hundred pounds each . "
17549	17561	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Ha ! Did they know that they would receive this ? "
17562	17580	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Yes ; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provi- sions of his wlll . "
17581	17587	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" That is very interesting . "
17588	17592	17594	17595	Dr. Mortimer	94	" I hope , "
17597	17627	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" that you do not look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles , for I also had a thousand pounds left to me . "
17628	17635	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Indeed ! And anyone else ? "
17636	17661	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" There were many insignificant sums to individuals , and a large number of public charities . The residue all went to Sir Henry . "
17662	17670	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" And how much was the residue ? "
17671	17679	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds . "
17687	17700	17702	17702	he	96	" I had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved , "
17704	17745	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich , but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities . The total value of the estate was close on to a million . "
17746	17798	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Dear me ! It is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game . And one more question , Dr. Mortimer . Suppos- ing that anything happened to our young friend here - you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis ! - who would inherit the estate ? "
17799	17834	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Since Rodger Baskerville , Sir Charles 's younger brother died unmarried , the estate would descend to the Desmonds , who are distant cousins . James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland . "
17835	17854	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Thank you . These details are all of great interest . Have you met Mr. James Desmond ? "
17855	17899	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Yes ; he once came down to visit Sir Charles . He is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life . I remember that he refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles , though he pressed it upon him . "
17900	17917	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles 's thousands . "
17918	17964	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed . He would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner , who can , of course , do what he likes with it . "
17965	17976	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" And have you made your will , Sir Henry ? "
17977	18064	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" No , Mr. Holmes , I have not . I 've had no time , for it was only yesterday that I learned how matters stood . But in any case I feel that the money should go with the title and estate . That was my poor uncle 's idea . How is the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property ? House , land , and dollars must go together . "
18065	18111	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Quite so . Well , Sir Henry , I am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay . There is only one provision which I must make . You certainly must not go alone . "
18112	18119	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Dr. Mortimer returns with me . "
18120	18180	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to , and his house is miles away from yours . With all the good will in the world he may be unable to help you . No , Sir Henry , you must take with you someone , a trusty man , who will be always by your side . "
18181	18194	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Is it possible that you could come yourself , Mr. Holmes ? "
18195	18293	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in person ; but you can understand that , with my extensive con- sulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters , it is impossible for me to be absent from London for an indefinite time . At the present instant one of the most revered names in England is being besmirched by a black- mailer , and only I can stop a disastrous scandal . You will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor . "
18294	18302	16901	16901	Holmes	96	" Whom would you recommend , then ? "
18311	18347	18303	18303	Holmes	96	" If my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place . No one can say so more confidently than I. "
18375	18390	18392	18392	he	115	" Well , now , that is real kind of you , Dr. Watson , "
18394	18434	18392	18392	he	115	" You see how it is with me , and you know just as much about the matter as I do . If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I 'll never forget it . "
18469	18477	18479	18479	I.	0	" I will come , with pleasure , "
18480	18493	18479	18479	I.	0	" I do not know how I could employ my time better . "
18494	18504	18506	18506	Holmes	96	" And you will report very carefully to me , "
18508	18537	18506	18506	Holmes	96	" When a crisis comes , as it will do , I will direct how you shall act . I suppose that by Saturday all might be ready ? "
18538	18545	18479	18479	I.	0	" Would that suit Dr. Watson ? "
18546	18549	18506	18506	Holmes	96	" Perfectly . "
18550	18574	18479	18479	I.	0	" Then on Saturday , unless you hear to the contrary , we shall meet at the ten - thirty train from Paddington . "
18609	18614	18615	18615	he	115	" My missing boot ! "
18618	18627	18629	18630	Sherlock Holmes	96	" May all our difficulties vanish as easily ! "
18632	18642	18643	18644	Dr. Mortimer	94	" But it is a very , singular thing , "
18647	18656	18643	18644	Dr. Mortimer	94	" I searched this room carefully before lunch . "
18657	18663	18665	18665	Baskerville	115	" And so did I , "
18667	18674	18665	18665	Baskerville	115	" Every , inch of it . "
18675	18685	18643	18644	Dr. Mortimer	94	" There was certainly no boot in it then . "
18686	18702	18665	18665	Baskerville	115	" In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching . "
18941	18973	19134	19134	Holmes	96	" There go two of my threads , Watson . There is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you . We must cast round for another scent . "
18974	18985	19134	19134	Holmes	96	" We have still the cabman who drove the spy . "
18986	19017	19134	19134	Holmes	96	" Exactly . I haw wired to get his name and address from the Official Registry . I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question . "
19055	19078	19080	19080	he	350	" I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had been inquiring for No . 2704 , "
19082	19117	19080	19080	he	350	" I 've driven my cab this seven years and never a word of complaint . I came here straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had against me . "
19118	19132	19134	19134	Holmes	96	" I have nothing in the world against you , my good man , "
19136	19160	19134	19134	Holmes	96	" On the contrary , I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my questions . "
19161	19174	19176	19177	the cabman	1833	" Well , I 've had a good day and no mistake , "
19182	19193	19176	19177	the cabman	1833	" What was it you wanted to ask , sir ? "
19194	19210	19134	19134	Holmes	96	" First of all your name and address , in case I want you again . "
19211	19235	19176	19177	the cabman	1833	" John Clayton , 3 Turpey Street , the Borough . My cab is out of Shipley 's Yard , near Waterloo Station . "
19244	19276	19134	19134	Holmes	96	" Now , Clayton , tell me all about the fare who came and watched this house at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down Regent Street . "
19286	19309	19311	19311	he	1397	" Why there 's no good my telling you things , for you seem to know as much as I do already , "
19313	19339	19311	19311	he	1397	" The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him to anyone . "
19340	19384	19422	19422	Holmes	96	" My good fellow ; this is a very serious business , and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me . You say that your fare told you that he was a detective ? "
19385	19391	19311	19311	he	1397	" Yes , he did . "
19392	19399	19422	19422	Holmes	96	" When did he say this ? "
19400	19406	19311	19311	he	1397	" When he left me . "
19407	19414	19422	19422	Holmes	96	" Did he say anything more ? "
19415	19421	19311	19311	he	1397	" He mentioned his name . "
19432	19456	19422	19422	Holmes	96	" Oh , he men- tioned his name , did he ? That was imprudent . What was the name that he mentioned ? "
19457	19461	19463	19464	the cabman	1833	" His name , "
19466	19472	19463	19464	the cabman	1833	" was Mr. Sherlock Holmes . "
19507	19517	19519	19519	he	1833	" A touch , Watson - an undeniable touch ! "
19521	19554	19519	19519	he	1833	" I feel a foil as quick and supple as my own . He got home upon me very prettily that time . So his name was Sherlock Holmes , was it ? "
19555	19567	19500	19500	he	1833	" Yes , sir , that was the gentleman 's name . "
19568	19583	19519	19519	he	1833	" Excellent ! Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred . "
19584	19669	19500	19500	he	1833	" He hailed me at half - past nine in Trafalgar Square . He said that he was a detective , and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions . I was glad enough to agree . First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank . We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here . "
19670	19675	19677	19677	Holmes	96	" This very door , "
19679	19734	19500	19500	he	1833	" Well , I could n't be sure of that , but I dare say my fare knew all about it . We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half . Then the two gentlemen passed us , walking , and we followed down Baker Street and along - "
19735	19739	19741	19741	Holmes	96	" I know , "
19743	19856	19500	19500	he	1833	" Until we got three - quarters down Regent Street . Then my gentleman threw up the trap , and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go . I whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes . Then he paid up his two guineas , like a good one , and away he went into the station . Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said : ' It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes . ' That 's how I come to know the name . "
19857	19869	19500	19500	he	1833	" I see . And you saw no more of him ? "
19870	19879	19500	19500	he	1833	" Not after he went into the station . "
19880	19890	19500	19500	he	1833	" And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes ? "
19897	19976	19894	19894	his	1833	" Well , he was n't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe . I 'd put him at forty years of age , and he was of a middle height , two or three inches shorter than you , sir . He was dressed like a toff , and he had a black beard , cut square at the end , and a pale face . I do n't know as I could say more than that . "
19977	19983	19500	19500	he	1833	" Colour of his eyes ? "
19984	19993	19894	19894	his	1833	" No , I ca n't say that . "
19994	20002	19500	19500	he	1833	" Nothing more that you can remember ? "
20003	20010	19894	19894	his	1833	" No , sir ; nothing . "
20011	20042	19500	19500	he	1833	" Well , then , here is your half - sovereign . There 's another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information . Good - night ! "
20043	20054	19894	19894	his	1833	" Good - night , sir , and thank you ! "
20076	20090	20092	20092	he	96	" Snap goes our third thread , and we end where we began , "
20094	20196	20092	20092	he	96	" The cunning rascal ! He knew our number , knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had consulted me , spotted who I was in Regent Street , conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver , and so sent back this audacious message . I tell you , Watson , this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel . I 've been checkmated in London . I can only wish you better luck in Devonshire . But I 'm not easy in my mind about it . "
20197	20201	20092	20092	he	96	" About what ? "
20202	20267	20092	20092	he	96	" About sending you . It 's an ugly business , Watson , an ugly dangerous business , and the more I see of it the less I like it . Yes my dear fellow , you may laugh , but I give you my word that I shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more . "
20312	20328	20330	20330	he	96	" I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspi- cions , Watson , "
20332	20358	20330	20330	he	96	" I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me , and you can leave me to do the theorizing . "
20359	20365	20366	20366	I	0	" What sort of facts ? "
20369	20500	20330	20330	he	96	" Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indi- rect upon the case , and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concern- ing the death of Sir Charles . I have made some inquiries myself in the last few days , but the results have , I fear , been negative . One thing only appears to be certain , and that is that Mr. James Desmond , who is the next heir , is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition , so that this persecution does not arise from him . I really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations . There remain the people who will actually surround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor . "
20501	20519	20330	20330	he	96	" Would it not be well in the first place to get rid ofl this Barrymore couple ? "
20520	20685	20330	20330	he	96	" By no means . You could not make a greater mistake . If they are innocent it would be a cruel injustice , and if they are guilty we should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them . No , no , we will preserve them upon our list of suspects . Then there is a groom at the Hall , if I remember right . There are two moorland farmers . There is our friend Dr. Mortimer , whom I believe to be entirely honest , and there is his wife , of whom we know nothing . There is this naturalist , Stapleton , and there is his sister , who is said to be a young lady of attractions . There is Mr. Frankland , of Lafter Hall , who is also an unknown factor . and there are one or two other neighbours . These are the folk who must be your very special study . "
20686	20693	20330	20330	he	96	" I will do my best . "
20694	20702	20330	20330	he	96	" You have arms , I suppose ? "
20703	20715	20330	20330	he	96	" Yes , I thought it as well to take them . "
20716	20735	20330	20330	he	96	" Most certainly . Keep your revolver near you night and day , and never relax your precautions . "
20755	20766	20768	20769	Dr. Mortimer	94	" No , we have no news of any kind , "
20778	20821	20768	20769	Dr. Mortimer	94	" I can swear to one thing , and that is that we have not been shadowed during the last two days . We have never gone out without keeping a sharp watch , and no one could have escaped our notice . "
20822	20832	20736	20737	Our friends	1816	" You have always kept together , I presume ? "
20833	20866	20768	20769	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Except yesterday afternoon . I usually give up one day to pure amusement when I come to town , so I spent it at the Museum of the College of Surgeons . "
20867	20880	20882	20882	Baskerville	100	" And I went to look at the folk in the park , "
20884	20894	20882	20882	Baskerville	100	" But we had no trouble of any kind . "
20895	20904	20906	20906	Holmes	96	" It was imprudent , all the same , "
20916	20948	20909	20909	his	96	" I beg , Sir Henry , that you will not go about alone . Some great misfortune will befall you if you do . Did you get your other boot ? "
20949	20959	20882	20882	Baskerville	100	" No , sir , it is gone forever . "
20960	20974	20975	20975	he	96	" Indeed . That is very interesting . Well , good - bye , "
20987	21028	20975	20975	he	96	" Bear in mind , Sir Henry , one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read to us and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted . "
21162	21181	21183	21183	he	137	" I 've been over a good part of the world since I left it , Dr. Watson , "
21185	21198	21183	21183	he	137	" but I have never seen a place to compare with it . "
21199	21214	21215	21215	I	0	" l never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county , "
21218	21234	21236	21237	Dr. Mortimer	94	" It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county , "
21239	21303	21236	21237	Dr. Mortimer	94	" A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the Celt , which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment . Poor Sir Charles 's head was of a very rare type , half Gaelic , half Ivernian in its characteristics . But you were very young when you last saw Baskerville Hall , were you not ? "
21304	21378	21183	21183	he	137	" I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father 's death and had never seen the Hall , for he lived in a little cottage on the South Coast . Thence I went straight to a friend in America . I tell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson , and I 'm as keen as possible to see the moor . "
21379	21400	21402	21403	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Are you ? Then your wish is easily granted , for there is your first sight of the moor , "
22025	22028	22030	22031	Dr. Mortimer	94	" Halloa ! "
22033	22038	22030	22031	Dr. Mortimer	94	" what is this ? "
22103	22110	22112	22113	Dr. Mortimer	94	" What is this , Perkins ? "
22123	22179	22120	22120	his	411	" There 's a convict escaped from Princetown , sir . He 's been out three days now , and the warders watch every road and every station , but they 've had no sight of him yet . The farmers about here do n't like it , sir , and that 's a fact . "
22180	22196	22120	22120	his	411	" Well , I understand that they get five pounds if they can give information . "
22197	22244	22120	22120	his	411	" Yes , sir , but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared to the chance of having your throat cut . You see , it is n't like any ordinary convict . This is a man that would stick at nothing . "
22245	22252	22120	22120	his	411	" Who is he , then ? "
22253	22263	22120	22120	his	411	" It is Selden , the Notting Hill murderer . "
22586	22590	22592	22592	he	310	" Baskerville Hall , "
22744	22749	22750	22750	he	100	" Was it here ? "
22757	22771	22750	22750	he	100	" No , no , the yew alley is on the other side . "
22782	22804	22806	22806	he	100	" It 's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a place as this , "
22808	22857	22806	22806	he	100	" It 's enough to scare any man . I 'll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months , and you wo n't know it again , with a thousand candle- power Swan and Edison right here in front of the hall door . "
22994	23005	23006	23008	A tall man	445	" Welcome , Sir Henry ! Welcome to Baskerville Hall ! "
23054	23067	23069	23070	Dr. Mortimer	94	" You do n't mind my driving straight home , Sir Henry ? "
23072	23079	23069	23070	Dr. Mortimer	94	" My wife is expecting me . "
23080	23090	23041	23041	She	1620	" Surely you will stay and have some dinner ? "
23091	23147	23069	23070	Dr. Mortimer	94	" No , I must go . I shall probably find some work awaiting me . I would stay to show you over the house , but Barrymore will be a better guide than I. Good - bye , and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I can be of service . "
23286	23295	23297	23298	Sir Henry	115	" It 's just as I imagined it , "
23300	23342	23297	23298	Sir Henry	115	" Is it not the very picture of an old family home ? To think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived . It strikes me solemn to think of it . "
23437	23450	23414	23414	He	111	" Would you wish dinner to be served at once , sir ? "
23451	23456	23414	23414	He	111	" Is it ready ? "
23457	23515	23414	23414	He	111	" In a very few minutes , sir . You will find hot water in your rooms . My wife and I will be happy , Sir Henry , to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements , but you will understand that under the new conditions this house will require a considerable staff . "
23516	23521	23414	23414	He	111	" What new conditions ? "
23522	23569	23414	23414	He	111	" I only meant , sir , that Sir Charles led a very retired life , and we were able to look after his wants . You would , naturally , wish to have more company , and so you will need changes in your household . "
23570	23583	23414	23414	He	111	" Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave ? "
23584	23596	23414	23414	He	111	" Only when it is quite convenient to you , sir . "
23597	23629	23414	23414	He	111	" But your family have been with us for several generations , have they not ? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family connection . "
23645	23708	23414	23414	He	111	" I feel that also , sir , and so does my wife . But to tell the truth , sir , we were both very much attached to Sir Charles and his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us . I fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall . "
23709	23718	23414	23414	He	111	" But what do you intend to do ? "
23719	23766	23414	23414	He	111	" I have no doubt , sir , that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in some business . Sir Charles 's generosity has given us the means to do so . And now , sir , perhaps I had best show you to your rooms . "
24062	24074	24076	24077	Sir Henry	115	" My word , it is n't a very cheerful place , "
24079	24150	24076	24077	Sir Henry	115	" I suppose one can tone down to it , but I feel a bit out of the picture at present . I do n't wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this . However , if it suits you , we will retire early to - night , and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning . "
24526	24542	24544	24545	the baronet	292	" I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame ! "
24547	24585	24544	24545	the baronet	292	" We were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive , so we took a gray view of the place . Now we are fresh and well , so it is all cheerful once more . "
24586	24598	24599	24599	I	0	" And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination , "
24602	24624	24599	24599	I	0	" Did you , for example , happen to hear someone , a woman I think , sobbing in the night ? "
24625	24671	24544	24545	the baronet	292	" That is curious , for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard something of the sort . I waited quite a time , but there was no more of it , so I concluded that it was all a dream . "
24672	24692	24703	24703	He	497	" I heard it distinctly , and I am sure that it was really the sob of a woman . "
24693	24702	24703	24703	He	497	" We must ask about this right away . "
24743	24756	24757	24757	he	497	" There are only two women in the house , Sir Henry , "
24760	24797	24757	24757	he	497	" One is the scullery - maid , who sleeps in the other wing . The other is my wife , and I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her . "
25171	25176	25178	25178	he	1918	" Certainly , sir , "
25180	25193	25178	25178	he	1918	" I had the telegram delivered to Mr. Barrymore exactly as directed . "
25194	25199	25159	25161	the village grocer	518	" Who delivered it ? "
25200	25224	25178	25178	he	1918	" My boy here . James , you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore at the Hall last week , did you not ? "
25225	25234	25159	25161	the village grocer	518	" Yes , father , I delivered it . "
25235	25241	25242	25242	I	0	" Into his own hands ? "
25245	25289	25159	25161	the village grocer	518	" Well , he was up in the loft at the time , so that I could not put it into his own hands , but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore 's hands , and she promised to deliver it at once . "
25290	25297	25159	25161	the village grocer	518	" Did you see Mr. Barrymore ? "
25298	25312	25159	25161	the village grocer	518	" No , sir ; I tell you he was in the loft . "
25313	25331	25159	25161	the village grocer	518	" If you did n't see him , how do you know he was in the loft ? "
25332	25346	25348	25349	the postmaster	1918	" Well , surely his own wife ought to know where he is , "
25352	25374	25348	25349	the postmaster	1918	" Did n't he get the telegram ? If there is any mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain . "
25753	25768	25770	25770	he	94	" You will , I am sure , excuse my presumption , Dr. Watson , "
25781	25821	25770	25770	he	94	" Here on the moor we are homely folk and do not wait for formal introduc- tions . You may possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend , Mortimer . I am Stapleton , of Merripit House . "
25822	25834	25836	25836	I	0	" Your net and box would have told me as much , "
25838	25856	25836	25836	I	0	" for I knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist . But how did you know me ? "
25857	25913	25770	25770	he	94	" I have been calling on Mortimer , and he pointed you out to me from the window of his surgery as you passed . As our road lay the same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself . I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his journey ? "
25914	25923	25836	25836	I	0	" He is very well , thank you . "
25924	25999	25770	25770	he	94	" We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here . It is asking much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind , but I need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside . Sir Henry has , I suppose , no superstitious fears in the matter ? "
26000	26010	25836	25836	I	0	" I do not think that it is likely . "
26011	26027	25770	25770	he	94	" Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family ? "
26028	26034	25836	25836	I	0	" I have heard it . "
26035	26066	26067	26067	He	535	" It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here ! Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the moor . "
26090	26117	26082	26082	he	535	" The story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles , and I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end . "
26118	26122	25836	25836	I	0	" But how ? "
26123	26194	26082	26082	he	535	" His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart . I fancy that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley . I feared that some disaster might occur , for I was very fond of the old man , and I knew that his heart was weak . "
26195	26202	25836	25836	I	0	" How did you know that ? "
26203	26210	26082	26082	he	535	" My friend Mortimer told me . "
26211	26233	25836	25836	I	0	" You think , then , that some dog pursued Sir Charles , and that he died of fright in consequence ? "
26234	26241	26082	26082	he	535	" Have you any better explanation ? "
26242	26251	25836	25836	I	0	" I have not come to any conclusion . "
26252	26258	26082	26082	he	535	" Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes ? "
26288	26306	26308	26308	he	537	" It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you , Dr Watson , "
26310	26377	26308	26308	he	537	" The records of your detective have reached us here , and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself . When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your identity . If you are here , then it follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter , and I am naturally curious to know what view he may take . "
26378	26390	25836	25836	I	0	" I am afraid that I can not answer that question . "
26391	26407	26308	26308	he	537	" May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himsel ? "
26408	26426	25836	25836	I	0	" He can not leave town at present . He has other cases which engage his attention . "
26427	26508	26308	26308	he	537	" What a pity ! He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us . But as to your own researches , if there is any possible way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will command me . If I had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case , I might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice . "
26509	26538	25836	25836	I	0	" I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend , Sir Henry , and that I need no help of any kind . "
26539	26542	26544	26544	Stapleton	117	" Excellent ! "
26546	26583	26544	26544	Stapleton	117	" You are perfectly right to be wary and discreet . I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable intrusion , and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again . "
26664	26679	26681	26681	he	117	" A moderate walk along this moor - path brings us to Merripit House , "
26683	26703	26681	26681	he	117	" Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister . "
26776	26786	26788	26788	he	117	" It is a wonderful place , the moor , "
26812	26844	26788	26788	he	117	" You never tire of the moor . You can not think the wonderful secrets which it contains . It is so vast , and so barren , and so mysterious . "
26845	26853	26764	26764	Stapleton	117	" You know it well , then ? "
26854	26910	26788	26788	he	117	" I have only been here two years . The residents would call me a newcomer . We came shortly after Sir Charles settled . But my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round , and I should think that there are few men who know it better than I do . "
26911	26918	26764	26764	Stapleton	117	" Is it hard to know ? "
26919	26953	26788	26788	he	117	" Very hard . You see , for example , this great plain to the north here with the queer hills breaking out of it . Do you observe anything remarkable about that ? "
26954	26965	26764	26764	Stapleton	117	" It would be a rare place for a gallop . "
26966	26994	26788	26788	he	117	" You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their lives before now . You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it ? "
26995	27006	26764	26764	Stapleton	117	" Yes , they seem more fertile than the rest . "
27010	27018	27020	27020	he	117	" That is the great Grimpen Mire , "
27022	27128	27020	27020	he	117	" A false step yonder means death to man or beast . Only yesterday I saw one of the moor ponies wander into it . He never came out . I saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog - hole , but it sucked him down at last . Even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it , but after these autumn rains it is an awful place . And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive . By George , there is another of those miserable ponies ! "
27178	27183	27185	27185	he	117	" It 's gone ! "
27187	27242	27185	27185	he	117	" The mire has him . Two in two days , and many more , perhaps , for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches . It 's a bad place , the great Grimpen Mire . "
27243	27252	27357	27357	He	117	" And you say you can penetrate it ? "
27253	27276	27185	27185	he	117	" Yes , there are one or two paths which a very active man can take . I have found them out . "
27277	27291	27357	27357	He	117	" But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place ? "
27292	27346	27185	27185	he	117	" Well , you see the hills beyond ? They are really islands cut off on all sides by the impassable mire , which has crawled round them in the course of years . That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are , if you have the wit to reach them . "
27347	27356	27357	27357	He	117	" I shall try my luck some day . "
27366	27380	27382	27382	he	117	" For God 's sake put such an idea out of your mind , "
27384	27426	27185	27185	he	117	" Your blood would be upon my head . I assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive . It is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do it . "
27427	27430	27431	27431	I	0	" Halloa ! "
27434	27439	27431	27431	I	0	" What is that ? "
27507	27514	27516	27516	he	117	" Queer place , the moor ! "
27518	27524	27504	27504	his	117	" But what is it ? "
27525	27556	27504	27504	his	117	" The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its prey . I 've heard it once or twice before , but never quite so loud . "
27605	27621	27623	27623	I.	0	" You are an educated man . You do n't believe such nonsense as that ? "
27624	27638	27623	27623	I.	0	" What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound ? "
27639	27660	27591	27598	a pair of ravens , which croaked loudly	554	" Bogs make queer noises sometimes . It 's the mud settling , or the water rising , or something . "
27661	27672	27623	27623	I.	0	" No , no , that was a living voice . "
27673	27688	27591	27598	a pair of ravens , which croaked loudly	554	" Well , perhaps it was . Did you ever hear a bittern booming ? "
27689	27696	27623	27623	I.	0	" No , I never did . "
27697	27745	27591	27598	a pair of ravens , which croaked loudly	554	" It 's a very rare bird - practically extinct - in England now , but all things are possible upon the moor . Yes , I should not be surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns . "
27746	27762	27623	27623	I.	0	" It 's the weirdest , strangest thing that ever I heard in my life . "
27763	27787	27591	27598	a pair of ravens , which croaked loudly	554	" Yes , it 's rather an uncanny place altogether . Look at the hillside yonder . What do you make of those ? "
27808	27817	27623	27623	I.	0	" What are they ? Sheep - pens ? "
27818	27887	27623	27623	I.	0	" No , they are the homes of our worthy ancestors . Prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor , and as no one in particular has lived there since , we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them . These are his wigwams with the roofs off . You can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside .
27888	27901	27623	27623	I.	0	" But it is quite a town . When was it inhabited ? "
27902	27909	27623	27623	I.	0	" Neolithic man - no date . "
27910	27916	27623	27623	I.	0	" What did he do ? "
27917	27987	27623	27623	I.	0	" He grazed his cattle on these slopes , and he learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe . Look at the great trench in the opposite hill . That is his mark . Yes , you will find some very singular points about the moor , Dr. Watson . Oh , excuse me an instant ! It is surely Cyclopides . "
28360	28364	28365	28365	she	568	" Go back ! "
28368	28377	28365	28365	she	568	" Go straight back to London , instantly . "
28404	28411	28412	28412	I	0	" Why should I go back ? "
28415	28421	28422	28422	She	568	" I can not explain . "
28439	28462	28422	28422	She	568	" But for God 's sake do what I ask you . Go back and never set foot upon the moor again . "
28463	28471	28436	28436	her	568	" But I have only just come . "
28472	28477	28478	28478	she	568	" Man , man ! "
28481	28572	28478	28478	she	568	" Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good ? Go back to London ! Start to - night ! Get away from this place at all costs ! Hush , my brother is coming ! Not a word of what I have said . Would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mare's - tails yonder ? We are very rich in orchids on the moor , though , of course , you are rather late to see the beauties of the place . "
28591	28596	28598	28598	he	575	" Halloa , Beryl ! "
28618	28628	28609	28609	his	575	" Well , Jack , you are very hot . "
28629	28660	28661	28661	He	575	" Yes , I was chasing a Cyclopides . He is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn . What a pity that I should have missed him ! "
28678	28688	28666	28666	his	575	" You have introduced yourselves , I can see . "
28689	28713	28609	28609	his	575	" Yes . I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor . "
28714	28724	28666	28666	his	575	" Why , who do you think this is ? "
28725	28736	28609	28609	his	575	" I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville . "
28737	28742	28744	28744	I.	0	" No , no , "
28745	28761	28744	28744	I.	0	" Only a humble commoner , but his friend . My name is Dr. Watson . "
28772	28781	28783	28783	she	576	" We have been talking at cross purposes , "
28785	28797	28798	28799	her brother	573	" Why , you had not very much time for talk , "
28807	28824	28826	28826	she	576	" I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a visitor , "
28828	28861	28826	28826	she	576	" It can not much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids . But you will come on , will you not , and see Merripit House ? "
29023	29033	29035	29035	he	592	" Queer spot to choose , is it not ? "
29044	29061	29035	29035	he	592	" And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy , do we not , Beryl ? "
29062	29066	29068	29068	she	593	" Quite happy , "
29081	29087	29089	29089	Stapleton	147	" I had a school , "
29091	29269	29089	29089	Stapleton	147	" It was in the north coun- try . The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting , but the privilege of living with youth , of helping to mould those young minds , and of impressing them with one 's own character and ideals was very dear to me . However , the fates were against us . A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died . It never recovered from the blow , and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up . And yet , if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys , I could rejoice over my own misfortune , for , with my strong tastes for botany and zoology , I find an unlimited field of work here , and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am . All this , Dr. Watson , has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window . "
29270	29296	29078	29078	her	593	" It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull - less for you , perhaps , than for your sister . "
29297	29307	29309	29309	she	595	" No , no , I am never dull , "
29312	29385	29078	29078	her	593	" We have books , we have our studies , and we have interest- ing neighbours . Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line . Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion . We knew him well and miss him more than I can tell . Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry ? "
29386	29396	29078	29078	her	593	" I am sure that he would be delighted . "
29397	29481	29078	29078	her	593	" Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so . We may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surround- ings . Will you come upstairs , Dr. Watson , and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera ? I think it is the most complete one in the south - west of England . By the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready . "
29667	29684	29686	29686	she	147	" I have run all the way in order to cut you off , Dr. Watson , "
29688	29751	29686	29686	she	147	" I had not even time to put on my hat . I must not stop , or my brother may miss me . I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry . Please forget the words I said , which have no application whatever to you . "
29752	29763	29765	29765	I.	603	" But I ca n't forget them , Miss Stapleton , "
29766	29803	29765	29765	I.	603	" I am Sir Henry 's friend , and his welfare is a very close concern of mine . Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London . "
29804	29835	29686	29686	she	147	" A woman 's whim , Dr. Watson . When you know me better you will understand that I can not always give reasons for what I say or do . "
29836	29936	29765	29765	I.	603	" No , no . I remember the thrill in your voice . I remembe the look in your eyes . Please , please , be frank with me , Miss Stapleton , for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me . Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire , with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track . Tell me then what it was that you meant , and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry . "
29960	29971	29973	29973	she	604	" You make too much of it , Dr. Watson , "
29975	30084	29973	29973	she	604	" My brother and I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles . We knew him very intimately , for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house . He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family , and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed . I was distressed therefore when another member of the family came down to live here , and I felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run . That was all which I intended to convey .
30085	30092	29686	29686	she	147	" But what is the danger ? "
30093	30102	29973	29973	she	604	" You know the story of the hound ? "
30103	30112	29686	29686	she	147	" I do not believe in such nonsense . "
30113	30159	29973	29973	she	604	" But I do . If you have any influence with Sir Henry , take him away from a place which has always been fatal to his family . The world is wide . Why should he wish to live at the place of danger ? "
30160	30201	29686	29686	she	147	" Because it is the place of danger . That is Sir Henry 's nature . I fear that unless you can give me some more definite informa- tion than this it would be impossible to get him to move . "
30202	30218	29973	29973	she	604	" I can not say anything definite , for I do not know anything definite . "
30219	30272	29686	29686	she	147	" I would ask you one more question , Miss Stapleton . If you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me , why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said ? There is nothing to which he , or anyone else , could object . "
30273	30359	30360	30360	She	605	" My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited , for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor . He would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to go away . But I have done my duty now and I will say no more . I must go back , or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you . Good - bye ! "
32683	32694	32696	32697	Sir Henry	115	" Did the boy deliver it into your own hands ? "
32710	32713	32715	32715	he	115	" No , "
32717	32738	32715	32715	he	115	" I was in the box - room at the time , and my wife brought it up to me . "
32739	32746	32696	32697	Sir Henry	115	" Did you answer it yourself ? "
32747	32765	32715	32715	he	115	" No ; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it . "
32779	32796	32798	32798	he	115	" I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning , Sir Henry , "
32800	32818	32798	32798	he	115	" I trust that they do not mean that I have done anything to forfeit your confidence ? "
33992	34013	34015	34015	he	292	" I knew that Barrymore walked about nights , and I had a mind to speak to him about it , "
34017	34042	34015	34015	he	292	" Two or three times I have heard hls steps in the passage , coming and going , just about the hour you name . "
34043	34057	34058	34058	I	0	" Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window , "
34061	34099	34058	34058	I	0	" Perhaps he does . If so , we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after . I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he were here . "
34100	34113	34115	34115	I.	0	" I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest , "
34116	34127	34115	34115	I.	0	" He would follow Barrymore and see what he did . "
34128	34136	34058	34058	I	0	" Then we shall do it together . "
34137	34145	34115	34115	I.	0	" But surely he would hear us . "
34146	34181	34058	34058	I	0	" The man is rather deaf , and in any case we must take our chance of that . We 'll sit up in my room to - night and wait until he passes . "
34428	34437	34438	34438	he	115	" What , are you coming , Watson ? "
34449	34461	34463	34463	I.	0	" That depends on whether you are going on the moor , "
34464	34470	34517	34517	his	115	" Yes , I am . "
34471	34513	34517	34517	his	115	" Well , you know what my instructions are . I am sorry to intrude , but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you , and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor . "
34527	34532	34534	34534	he	115	" My dear fellow , "
34536	34592	34534	34534	he	115	" Holmes , with all his wisdom , did not foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the moor . You understand me ? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil - sport . I must go out alone . "
35443	35454	35456	35456	he	292	" Halloa , Watson ! Where have you dropped from ? "
35458	35475	35456	35456	he	292	" You do n't mean to say that you came after me in spite of all ? "
35535	35556	35558	35558	he	292	" You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private , "
35560	35596	35558	35558	he	292	" but , by thunder , the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing - and a mighty poor wooing at that ! Where had you engaged a seat ? "
35597	35604	35525	35525	he	292	" I was on that hill . "
35605	35633	35558	35558	he	292	" Quite in the back row , eh ? But her brother was well up to the front . Did you see him come out on us ? "
35634	35640	35525	35525	he	292	" Yes , I did . "
35641	35656	35558	35558	he	292	" Did he ever strike you as being crazy - this brother of hers ? "
35657	35667	35525	35525	he	292	" I ca n't say that he ever did . "
35668	35749	35558	35558	he	292	" I dare say not . I always thought him sane enough until to - day , but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket . What 's the matter with me , anyhow ? You 've lived near me for some weeks , Watson . Tell me straight , now ! Is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved ? "
35750	35756	35525	35525	he	292	" I should say not . "
35757	35816	35558	35558	he	292	" He ca n't object to my worldly position , so it must be myself that he has this down on . What has he against me ? I never hurt man or woman in my life that I know of . And yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers . "
35817	35823	35525	35525	he	292	" Did he say so ? "
35824	36272	35558	35558	he	292	" That , and a deal more . I tell you , Watson , I 've only known her these few weeks , but from the first I just felt that she was made for me , and she , too - she was happy when she was with me , and that I 'll swear . There 's a light in a woman 's eyes that speaks louder than words . But he has never let us get together and it was only to - day for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone . She was glad to meet me , but when she did it was not love that she would talk about , and she would n't have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it . She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger , and that she would never be happy until I had left it . I told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it , and that if she really wanted me to go , the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me . With that I offered in as many words to marry her , but before she could answer , down came this brother of hers , running at us with a face on him like a madman . He was just white with rage , and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury . What was I doing with the lady ? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her ? Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked ? If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him . As it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of , and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife . That seemed to make the matter no better , so then I lost my temper too , and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps , consider- ing that she was standing by . So it ended by his going off with her , as you saw , and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county . Just tell me what it all means , Watson , and I 'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay . "
36436	36450	36452	36453	Sir Henry	115	" l do n't say now that he is n't a crazy man , "
36454	36490	36452	36453	Sir Henry	115	" I ca n't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning , but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done . "
36491	36501	36452	36453	Sir Henry	115	" Did he give any explanation of his conduct ? "
36502	36765	36452	36453	Sir Henry	115	" His sister is everything in his life , he says . That is natural enough , and I am glad that he should understand her value . They have always been together , and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with only her as a companion , so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him . He had not understood , he said , that I was becoming attached to her , but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so , and that she might be taken away from him , it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did . He was very sorry for all that had passed , and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life . If she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else . But in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it . He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady 's friendship during that time without claiming her love . This I promised , and so the matter rests . "
36926	36933	36923	36923	I	0	" by one night 's work , "
37470	37479	37462	37462	he	1397	" What are you doing here , Barrymore ? "
37480	37485	37486	37486	His	1397	" Nothing , sir . "
37511	37531	37492	37492	he	1397	" It was the window , sir . I go round at night to see that they are fastened . "
37532	37538	37462	37462	he	1397	" On the second floor ? "
37539	37548	37492	37492	he	1397	" Yes , sir , all the windows . "
37549	37555	37557	37558	Sir Henry	115	" Look here , Barrymore , "
37561	37606	37557	37558	Sir Henry	115	" we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you , so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later . Come , now ! No lies ! What were you doing at that window ? ? '
37636	37654	37618	37618	he	1397	" I was doing no harm , sir . I was holding a candle to the window . "
37655	37667	37618	37618	he	1397	" And why were you holding a candle to the window ? "
37668	37722	37618	37618	he	1397	" Do n't ask me , Sir Henry - do n't ask me ! I give you my word , sir , that it is not my secret , and that I can not tell it . If it concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you . "
37743	37754	37756	37756	I.	0	" He must have been holding it as a signal , "
37757	37767	37772	37772	he	459	" Let us see if there is any answer . "
37852	37857	37858	37858	I	0	" There it is ! "
37861	37876	37877	37878	the butler	459	" No , no , sir , it is nothing - nothing at all ! "
37882	37889	37877	37878	the butler	459	" I assure you , sir - "
37890	37900	37902	37903	the baronet	292	" Move your light across the window , Watson ! "
37905	37950	37902	37903	the baronet	292	" See , the other moves also ! Now , you rascal , do you deny that it is a signal ? Come , speak up ! Who is your confeder- ate out yonder , and what is this conspiracy that is going on ? "
37959	37974	38061	38062	a woman	1620	" It is my business , and not yours . I will not tell . "
37975	37984	38061	38062	a woman	1620	" Then you leave my employment right away . "
37985	37997	38061	38062	a woman	1620	" Very good , sir . If I must I must . "
37998	38044	38061	38062	a woman	1620	" And you go in disgrace . By thunder , you may well be ashamed of yourself . Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof , and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me . "
38045	38058	38061	38062	a woman	1620	" No , no , sir ; no , not against you ! "
38110	38131	38133	38134	the butler	459	" We have to go , Eliza . This is the end of it . You can pack our things , "
38136	38175	38133	38134	the butler	459	" Oh , John , John , have I brought you to this ? It is my doing , Sir Henry - all mine . He has done nothing except for my sake and because I asked him . "
38176	38187	38133	38134	the butler	459	" Speak out , then ! What does it mean ? "
38188	38239	38133	38134	the butler	459	" My unhappy brother is starving on the moor . We can not let him perish at our very gates . The light is a signal to him that food is ready for him , and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it . "
38240	38246	38133	38134	the butler	459	" Then your brother is - "
38247	38259	38133	38134	the butler	459	" The escaped convict , sir - Selden , the criminal . "
38260	38268	38270	38270	Barrymore	143	" That 's the truth , sir , "
38272	38314	38270	38270	Barrymore	143	" I said that it was not my secret and that I could not tell it to you . But now you have heard it , and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you . "
38371	38718	38719	38720	The woman	836	" Yes , sir , my name was Selden , and he is my younger brother . We humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure , and that he could do what he liked in it . Then as he grew older he met wicked companions , and the devil entered into him until he broke my mother 's heart and dragged our name in the dirt . From crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold ; but to me , sir , he was always the little curly - headed boy that I had nursed and played with as an elder sister would . That was why he broke prison , sir . He knew that I was here and that we could not refuse to help him . When he dragged himself here one night , weary and starving , with the warders hard at his heels , what could we do ? We took him in and fed him and cared for him . Then you returned , sir , and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over , so he lay in hiding there . But every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a light in the window , and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him . Every day we hoped that he was gone , but as long as he was there we could not desert him . That is the whole truth , as I am an honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me , for whose sake he has done all that he has . "
38734	38741	38719	38720	The woman	836	" Is this true , Barrymore ? "
38742	38753	38719	38720	The woman	836	" Yes , Sir Henry . Every word of it . "
38754	38795	38719	38720	The woman	836	" Well , I can not blame you for standing by your own wife . Forget what I have said . Go to your room , you two , and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning . "
38843	38849	38851	38852	Sir Henry	115	" I wonder he dares , "
38854	38868	38851	38852	Sir Henry	115	" It may be so placed as to be only visible from here . "
38869	38881	38851	38852	Sir Henry	115	" Very likely . How far do you think it is ? "
38882	38892	38851	38852	Sir Henry	115	" Out by the Cleft Tor , I think . "
38893	38903	38851	38852	Sir Henry	115	" Not more than a mile or two off . "
38904	38908	38851	38852	Sir Henry	115	" Hardly that . "
38909	38954	38851	38852	Sir Henry	115	" Well , it can not be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it . And he is waiting , this villain , beside that candle . By thunder , Watson , I am going out to take that man ! "
39084	39089	39091	39091	I.	849	" I will come , "
39092	39122	39091	39091	I.	849	" Then get your revolver and put on your boots . The sooner we start the better , as the fellow may put out his light and be off . "
39219	39224	39225	39225	I	0	" Are you armed ? "
39228	39236	39314	39314	his	292	" I have a hunting - crop . "
39237	39273	39314	39314	his	292	" We must close in on him rapidly , for he is said to be a desperate fellow . We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist . "
39274	39280	39282	39283	the baronet	292	" I say , Watson , "
39285	39308	39282	39283	the baronet	292	" what would Holmes say to this ? How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted ? "
39411	39421	39397	39398	The baronet	292	" My God , what 's that , Watson ? "
39422	39444	39397	39398	The baronet	292	" I do n't know . It 's a sound they have on the moor . I heard it once before . "
39468	39471	39473	39474	the baronet	292	" Watson , "
39476	39485	39473	39474	the baronet	292	" it was the cry of a hound . "
39513	39521	39522	39522	he	292	" What do they call this sound ? "
39525	39528	39500	39500	his	292	" Who ? "
39529	39536	39500	39500	his	292	" The folk on the countryside . "
39537	39554	39500	39500	his	292	" Oh , they are ignorant people . Why should you mind what they call it ? "
39555	39568	39500	39500	his	292	" Tell me , Watson . What do they say of it ? "
39578	39592	39500	39500	his	292	" They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles . "
39603	39609	39610	39610	he	292	" A hound it was , "
39615	39631	39610	39610	he	292	" but it seemed to come from miles away , over yonder , I think . "
39632	39642	39500	39500	his	292	" It was hard to say whence it came . "
39643	39663	39610	39610	he	292	" It rose and fell with the wind . Is n't that the direction of the great Grimpen Mire ? "
39664	39670	39500	39500	his	292	" Yes , it is . "
39671	39713	39610	39610	he	292	" Well , it was up there . Come now , Watson , did n't you think yourself that it was the cry of a hound ? I am not a child . You need not fear to speak the truth . "
39714	39738	39500	39500	his	292	" Stapleton was with me when I heard it last . He said that it might be the calling of a strange bird . "
39739	39788	39610	39610	he	292	" No , no , it was a hound . My God , can there be some truth in all these stories ? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause ? You do n't believe it , do you , Watson ? "
39789	39794	39500	39500	his	292	" No , no . "
39795	39880	39610	39610	he	292	" And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London , and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that . And my uncle ! There was the footprint of the hound beside him as he lay . It all fits together . I do n't think that I am a coward , Watson , but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood . Feel my hand ! "
39891	39901	39500	39500	his	292	" You 'll be all right to - morrow . "
39902	39926	39500	39500	his	292	" I do n't think I 'll get that cry out of my head . What do you advise that we do now ? "
39927	39933	39500	39500	his	292	" Shall we turn back ? "
39934	39995	39500	39500	his	292	" No , by thunder ; we have come out to get our man , and we will do it . We after the convict , and a hell - hound , as likely as not , after us . Come on ! We 'll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the moor . "
40196	40203	40205	40206	Sir Henry	115	" What shall we do now ? "
40208	40231	40205	40206	Sir Henry	115	" Wait here . He must be near his light . Let us see if we can get a glimpse of him . "
41008	41015	41017	41017	he	292	" A warder , no doubl , "
41019	41032	41017	41017	he	292	" The moor has been thick with them since this fellow escaped . "
42232	42241	42242	42242	he	292	" Barrymore considers that he has a grievance , "
42245	42279	42242	42242	he	292	" He thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother - in - law down when he , of his own free will , had told us the secret . "
42292	42302	42304	42304	he	459	" I may have spoken too warmly , sir , "
42306	42366	42304	42304	he	459	" and if I have , I am sure that I beg your pardon . At the same time , I was very much surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you had been chasing Selden . The poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track . "
42367	42386	42388	42389	the baronet	292	" If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different thing , "
42391	42418	42388	42389	the baronet	292	" you only told us , or rather your wife only told us , when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself . "
42419	42440	42304	42304	he	459	" I did n't think you would have taken advantage of it , Sir Henry - indeed I did n't . "
42441	42517	42388	42389	the baronet	292	" The man is a public danger . There are lonely houses scat- tered over the moor , and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing . You only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that . Look at Mr. Stapleton 's house , for example , with no one but himself to defend it . There 's no safety for anyone untill he is under lock and key . "
42518	42653	42304	42304	he	459	" He 'll break into no house , sir . I give you my solemn word upon that . But he will never trouble anyone in this country again . I assure you , Sir Henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to South America . For God 's sake , sir , I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor . They have given up the chase there , and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him . You ca n't tell on him without getting my wife and me into trouble . I beg you , sir , to say nothing to the police . "
42654	42662	42388	42389	the baronet	292	" What do you say , Watson ? "
42668	42688	42663	42663	I	0	" If he were safely out of the country it would relieve the tax - payer of a burden . "
42689	42704	42388	42389	the baronet	292	" But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes ? "
42705	42740	42663	42663	I	0	" He would not do anything so mad , sir . We have provided him with all that he can want . To commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding . "
42741	42746	42748	42749	Sir Henry	115	" That is true , "
42751	42756	42748	42749	Sir Henry	115	" Well , Barrymore - "
42757	42784	42663	42663	I	0	" God bless you , sir , and thank you from my heart ! It would have killed my poor wife had he been taken again . "
42785	42835	42748	42749	Sir Henry	115	" I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony , Watson ? But , after what we have heard I do n't feel as if I could give the man up , so there is an end of it . All right , Barrymore , you can go . "
42855	42932	42848	42848	he	1397	" You 've been so kind to us , sir , that I should like to do the best I can for you in return . I know something , Sir Henry , and perhaps I should have said it before , but it was long after the inquest that I found it out . I 've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man . It 's about poor Sir Charles 's death . "
42943	42951	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" Do you know how he died ? "
42952	42963	42663	42663	I	0	" No , sir , I do n't know that . "
42964	42968	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" What then ? "
42969	42989	42663	42663	I	0	" I know why he was at the gate at that hour . It was to meet a woman . "
42990	42998	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" To meet a woman ! He ? "
42999	43004	42663	42663	I	0	" Yes , sir . "
43005	43012	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" And the woman 's name ? "
43013	43037	42663	42663	I	0	" I ca n't give you the name , sir , but I can give you the initials . Her initials were L. L. "
43038	43047	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" How do you know this , Barrymore ? "
43048	43138	42663	42663	I	0	" Well , Sir Henry , your uncle had a letter that morning . He had usually a great many letters , for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart , so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him . But that morning , as it chanced , there was only this one letter , so I took the more notice of it . It was from Coombe Tracey , and it was addressed in a woman 's hand . "
43139	43142	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" Well ? "
43143	43300	42663	42663	I	0	" Well , sir , I thought no more of the matter , and never would have done had it not been for my wife . Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out Sir Charles 's study - it had never been touched since his death - and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate . The greater part of it was charred to pieces , but one little slip , the end of a page , hung together , and the writing could still be read , though it was gray on a black ground . It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it said : ' Please , please , as you are a gentleman , burn this letter , and be at the gate by ten o clock . Beneath it were signed the initials L. L. "
43301	43308	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" Have you got that slip ? "
43309	43324	42663	42663	I	0	" No , sir , it crumbled all to bits after we moved it . "
43325	43338	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" Had Sir Charles received any other lettefs in the same writting ? "
43339	43368	42663	42663	I	0	" Well , sir , I took no particular notice of his letters . I should not have noticed this one , only it happened to come alone . "
43369	43380	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" And you have no idea who L. L. is ? "
43381	43414	42663	42663	I	0	" No , sir . No more than you have . But I expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles 's death . "
43415	43432	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" I can not understand , Barrymore , how you came to conceal this important information . "
43433	43514	42663	42663	I	0	" Well , sir , it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us . And then again , sir , we were both of us very fond of Sir Charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us . To rake this up could n't help our poor master , and it 's well to go carefully when there 's a lady in the case . Even the best of us - "
43515	43524	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" You thought it might injure his reputation ? "
43525	43571	42663	42663	I	0	" Well , sir , I thought no good could come of it . But now you have been kind to us , and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter . "
43572	43582	42933	42934	The baronet	292	" Very good , Barrymore ; you can go . "
43595	43609	42663	42663	I	0	" Well , Watson , what do you think of this new light ? "
43610	43622	42663	42663	I	0	" It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before . "
43623	43675	42663	42663	I	0	" So I think . But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole business . We have gained that much . We know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her . What do you think we should do ? "
43676	43711	42663	42663	I	0	" Let Holmes know all about it at once . It will give him the clue for which he has been seeking . I am much mistaken if it does not bring him down . "
44240	44247	44249	44249	I	0	" By the way , Mortimer , "
44258	44277	44249	44249	I	0	" I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know ? "
44278	44285	44249	44249	I	0	" Hardly any , I think . "
44286	44305	44249	44249	I	0	" Can you , then , tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L. L. ? "
44313	44316	44318	44318	he	94	" No , "
44320	44356	44357	44357	he	94	" There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom I ca n't answer , but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose initials are those . Wait a bit though , "
44363	44382	44357	44357	he	94	" There is Laura Lyons - her initials are L. L. - but she lives in Coombe Tracey . "
44383	44388	44389	44389	I	0	" Who is she ? "
44392	44399	44249	44249	I	0	" She is Frankland 's daughter . "
44400	44408	44357	44357	he	94	" What ! Old Frankland the crank ? "
44409	44499	44249	44249	I	0	" Exactly . She married an artist named Lyons , who came sketching on the moor . He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her . The fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side . Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and per- haps for one or two other reasons as well . So , between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time . "
44500	44506	44357	44357	he	94	" How does she live ? "
44507	44599	44249	44249	I	0	" I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance , but it can not be more , for his own affairs are considerably involved . Whatever she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad . Her story got about , and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an honest living . Stapleton did for one , and Sir Charles for another . I gave a trifle myself . It was to set her up in a typewriting business . "
44815	44818	44820	44820	I	0	" Well , "
44822	44839	44820	44820	I	0	" has this precious relation of yours departed , or is he still lurking out yonder ? "
44840	44888	44793	44794	The butler	459	" I do n't know , sir . I hope to heaven that he has gone , for he has brought nothing but trouble here ! I 've not heard of him since I left out food for him last , and that was three days ago . "
44889	44896	44820	44820	I	0	" Did you see him then ? "
44897	44914	44793	44794	The butler	459	" No , sir , but the food was gone when next I went that way . "
44915	44922	44820	44820	I	0	" Then he was certainly there ? "
44923	44941	44793	44794	The butler	459	" So you would think , sir , unless it was the other man who took it . "
44958	44968	44820	44820	I	0	" You know that there is another man then ? "
44969	44982	44820	44820	I	0	" Yes , sir ; there is another man upon the moor . "
44983	44989	44820	44820	I	0	" Have you seen him ? "
44990	44995	44820	44820	I	0	" No , sir . "
44996	45005	44820	44820	I	0	" How do you know of him then ? "
45006	45065	45066	45066	He	987	" Selden told me of him , sir , a week ago or more . He 's in hiding , too , but he 's not a convict as far as I can make out . I do n't like it , Dr. Watson - I tell you straight , sir , that I do n't like it . "
45075	45123	44820	44820	I	0	" Now , listen to me , Barrymore ! I have no interest in this matter but that of your master . I have come here with no object except to help him . Tell me , frankly , what it is that you do n't like . "
45148	45159	45160	45160	he	987	" It 's all these goings - on , sir , "
45179	45220	45160	45160	he	987	" There 's foul play somewhere , and there 's black villainy brew- ing , to that I 'll swear ! Very glad I should be , sir , to see Sir Henry on his way back to London again ! "
45221	45230	45166	45166	his	987	" But what is it that alarms you ? "
45231	45343	45160	45160	he	987	" Look at Sir Charles 's death ! That was bad enough , for all that the coroner said . Look at the noises on the moor at night . There 's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it . Look at this stranger hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting ! What 's he waiting for ? What does it mean ? It means no good to anyone of the name of Baskerville , and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry 's new servants are ready to take over the Hall . "
45344	45350	45352	45352	I.	989	" But about this stranger , "
45353	45381	45352	45352	I.	989	" Can you tell me anything about him ? What did Selden say ? Did he find out where he hid , or what he was doing ? "
45382	45449	45160	45160	he	987	" He saw him once or twice , but he is a deep one and gives nothing away . At first he thought that he was the police , but soon he found that he had some lay of his own . A kind of gentleman he was , as far as he could see , but what he was doing he could not make out . "
45450	45460	45352	45352	I.	989	" And where did he say that he lived ? "
45461	45481	45160	45160	he	987	" Among the old houses on the hillside - the stone huts where the old folk used to live . "
45482	45489	45352	45352	I.	989	" But how about his food ? "
45490	45523	45160	45160	he	987	" Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all he needs . I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants . "
45524	45540	45352	45352	I.	989	" Very good , Barrymore . We may talk further of this some other time . "
46262	46268	46270	46270	I	0	" I have the pleasure , "
46272	46278	46270	46270	I	0	" of knowing your father . "
46293	46305	46306	46306	she	590	" There is nothing in common between my father and me , "
46309	46348	46306	46306	she	590	" I owe him nothing , and his friends are not mine . If it were not for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved for all that my father cared . "
46349	46367	46373	46374	the lady	590	" It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to see you . "
46378	46387	46388	46388	she	590	" What can I tell you about him ? "
46403	46412	46392	46392	her	590	" You knew him , did you not ? "
46413	46450	46469	46469	her	590	" I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness . If I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation . "
46451	46458	46392	46392	her	590	" Did you correspond with him ? "
46473	46482	46483	46483	she	590	" What is the object of these questions ? "
46487	46516	46469	46469	her	590	" The object is to avoid a public scandal . It is better that I should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control . "
46542	46549	46550	46550	she	590	" Well , I 'll answer , "
46553	46559	46550	46550	she	590	" What are your questions ? "
46560	46568	46469	46469	her	590	" Did you correspond with Sir Charles ? "
46569	46586	46550	46550	she	590	" I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity . "
46587	46596	46469	46469	her	590	" Have you the dates of those letters ? "
46597	46600	46550	46550	she	590	" No . "
46601	46608	46469	46469	her	590	" Have you ever met him ? "
46609	46639	46550	46550	she	590	" Yes , once or twice , when he came into Coombe Tracey . He was a very retiring man , and he preferred to do good by stealth . "
46640	46676	46469	46469	her	590	" But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom , how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you , as you say that he has done ? "
46686	46735	46677	46677	She	1018	" There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help me . One was Mr. Stapleton , a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir Charles 's . He was exceedingly kind , and it was through him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs . "
46765	46779	46780	46780	I	0	" Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you ? "
46790	46802	46783	46784	Mrs. Lyons	152	" Really , sir , this is a very extraordinary question . "
46803	46816	46783	46784	Mrs. Lyons	152	" I am sorry , madam , but I must repeat it . "
46817	46825	46783	46784	Mrs. Lyons	152	" Then I answer , certainly not . "
46826	46838	46783	46784	Mrs. Lyons	152	" Not on the very day of Sir Charles 's death ? "
46862	46864	46783	46784	Mrs. Lyons	152	" No "
46872	46879	46881	46881	I.	0	" Surely your memory deceives you , "
46882	46920	46881	46881	I.	0	" I could even quote a passage of your letter . It ran ' Please , please , as you are a gentleman , burn this letter , and be at the gate by ten o'clock . ' "
46937	46947	46948	46948	she	590	" Is there no such thing as a gentleman ? "
46951	46984	46921	46921	I	0	" You do Sir Charles an injustice . He did burn the letter . But sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned . You acknowledge now that you wrote it ? "
46985	46993	46994	46994	she	590	" Yes , I did write it , "
47007	47058	46994	46994	she	590	" I did write it . Why should I deny it ? I have no reason to be ashamed of it . I wished him to help me . I believed that if I had an interview I could gain his help , so I asked him to meet me . "
47059	47067	46921	46921	I	0	" But why at such an hour ? "
47068	47101	46994	46994	she	590	" Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next day and might be away for months . There were reasons why I could not get there earlier . "
47102	47118	46921	46921	I	0	" But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house ? "
47119	47137	46994	46994	she	590	" Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor 's house ? "
47138	47149	46921	46921	I	0	" Well , what happened when you did get there ? "
47150	47155	46994	46994	she	590	" I never went . "
47156	47160	46921	46921	I	0	" Mrs. Lyons ! "
47161	47186	46994	46994	she	590	" No , I swear it to you on all I hold sacred . I never went . Something intervened to prevent my going . "
47187	47192	46921	46921	I	0	" What was that ? "
47193	47206	46994	46994	she	590	" That is a private matter . I can not tell it . "
47207	47241	46921	46921	I	0	" You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death , but you deny that you kept the appointment . "
47242	47248	46994	46994	she	590	" That is the truth . "
47267	47271	47273	47273	I	0	" Mrs. Lyons , "
47285	47358	47275	47275	I	0	" you are taking a very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know . If I have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compro- mised . If your position is innocent , why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that date ? "
47359	47383	46921	46921	I	0	" Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal . "
47384	47399	47275	47275	I	0	" And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your letter ? "
47400	47411	46921	46921	I	0	" If you have read the letter you will know . "
47412	47425	47275	47275	I	0	" I did not say that I had read all the letter . "
47426	47433	46921	46921	I	0	" You quoted some of it . "
47434	47487	47275	47275	I	0	" I quoted the postscript . The letter had , as I said , been burned and it was not all legible . I ask you once again why it was that you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received on the day of his death . "
47488	47497	46921	46921	I	0	" The matter is a very private one . "
47498	47510	47275	47275	I	0	" The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation . "
47511	47544	46921	46921	I	0	" I will tell you , then . If you have heard anything of my unhappy history you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it . "
47545	47552	47275	47275	I	0	" I have heard so much . "
47553	47668	46921	46921	I	0	" My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I abhor . The law is upon his side , and every day I am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him . At the time that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met . It meant everything to me - peace of mind , happiness , self - respect - everything . I knew Sir Charles 's generosity , and I thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help me . "
47669	47680	47275	47275	I	0	" Then how is it that you did not go ? "
47681	47693	46921	46921	I	0	" Because I received help in the interval from another source . "
47694	47709	47275	47275	I	0	" Why then , did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this ? "
47710	47728	46921	46921	I	0	" So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next morning . "
48315	48323	48325	48325	he	116	" Good - day , Dr. Watson , "
48331	48354	48325	48325	he	116	" you must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratulate me . "
48428	48450	48451	48451	he	116	" It is a great day for me , sir - one of the red - letter days of my life , "
48457	48632	48451	48451	he	116	" I have brought off a double event . I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law , and that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it . I have established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton 's park , slap across it , sir , within a hundred yards of his own front door . What do you think of that ? We 'll teach these magnates that they can not ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners , confound them ! And I 've closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk used to picnic . These infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property , and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles . Both cases decided Dr. Watson , and both in my favour . I have n't had such a day since I had Sir John Morland for trespass because he shot in his own warren . "
48633	48642	48418	48418	I	0	" How on earth did you do that ? "
48643	48680	48451	48451	he	116	" Look it up in the books , sir . It will repay reading - Frankland v. Morland , Court of Queen 's Bench . It cost me 200 pounds , but I got my verdict . "
48681	48689	48418	48418	I	0	" Did it do you any good ? "
48690	48825	48451	48451	he	116	" None , sir , none . I am proud to say that I had no interest in the matter . I act entirely from a sense of public duty . I have no doubt , for example , that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy to - night . I told the police last time they did it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions . The County Constabu- lary is in a scandalous state , sir , and it has not afforded me the protection to which I am entitled . The case of Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public . I told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me , and already my words have come true . "
48826	48830	48831	48831	I	0	" How so ? "
48844	48870	48451	48451	he	116	" Because I could tell them what they are dying to know ; but nothing would induce me to help the rascals in any way . "
48931	48939	48941	48941	I	0	" Some poaching case , no doubt ? "
48946	48971	48941	48941	I	0	" Ha , ha , my boy , a very much more important matter than that ! What about the convict on the moor ? "
48975	48987	48989	48989	I.	0	" You do n't mean that you know where he is ? "
48990	49046	49047	49047	He	1057	" I may not know exactly where he is , but I am quite sure that I could help the police to lay their hands on him . Has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so trace it to him ? "
49058	49062	49064	49064	I	0	" No doubt , "
49066	49080	49064	49064	I	0	" but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor ? "
49081	49101	49125	49125	his	1057	" I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes him his food . "
49135	49188	49125	49125	his	1057	" You 'll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child . I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof . He passes along the same path at the same hour , and to whom should he be going except to the convict ? "
49263	49291	49305	49305	His	1064	" I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father 's dinner . "
49325	49330	49332	49332	he	1064	" Indeed , sir ! "
49343	49404	49332	49332	he	1064	" Do you see that Black Tor over yonder ? Well , do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it ? It is the stoniest part of the whole moor . Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station ? Your suggestion , sir , is a most absurd one . "
49429	49503	49332	49332	he	1064	" You may be sure , sir , that I have very good grounds before I come to an opinion . I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle . Every day , and sometimes twice a day , I have been able - but wait a moment , Dr. Watson . Do my eyes deceive me , or is there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside ? "
49526	49533	49535	49535	Frankland	116	" Come , sir , come ! "
49540	49553	49535	49535	Frankland	116	" You will see with your own eyes and judge for yourself . "
49588	49603	49577	49577	his	116	" Quick , Dr. Watson , quick , before he passes over the hill ! "
49673	49680	49667	49667	he	1069	" Well ! Am I right ? "
49681	49696	49629	49629	he	1069	" Certainly , there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand . "
49697	49738	49667	49667	he	1069	" And what the errand is even a county constable could guess . But not one word shall they have from me , and I bind you to secrecy also , Dr. Watson . Not a word ! You understand ! "
49739	49745	49629	49629	he	1069	" Just as you wish . "
49746	49835	49667	49667	he	1069	" They have treated me shamefully - shamefully . When the facts come out in Frankland v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country . Nothing would induce me to help the police in any way . For all they cared it might have been me , instead of my effigy , which these rascals burned at the stake . Surely you are not going ! You will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion ! "
50497	50506	50489	50489	I	0	" Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey . "
51023	51034	51002	51002	he	1044	" It is a lovely evening , my dear Watson , "
51042	51056	51002	51002	he	1044	" I really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in . "
51125	51128	51129	51129	I	0	" Holmes ! "
51132	51135	51129	51129	I	0	" Holmes ! "
51136	51140	51142	51142	he	1044	" Come out , "
51144	51153	51142	51142	he	1044	" and please be careful with the revolver . "
51264	51277	51279	51279	I	0	" I never was more glad to see anyone in my life , "
51288	51295	51281	51281	I	0	" Or more astonished , eh ? "
51296	51305	51226	51226	he	1044	" Well , I must confess to it . "
51306	51350	51281	51281	I	0	" The surprise was not all on one side , I assure you . I had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat , still less that you were inside it , until I was within twenty paces of the door . "
51351	51358	51226	51226	he	1044	" My footprint , I presume ? "
51359	51452	51281	51281	I	0	" No , Watson , I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world . If you seri- ously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist ; for when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley , Oxford Street , I know that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood . You will see it there beside the path . You threw it down , no doubt , at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut . "
51453	51456	51226	51226	he	1044	" Exactly . "
51457	51500	51281	51281	I	0	" I thought as much - and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced that you were sitting in ambush , a weapon within reach , waiting for the tenant to return . So you actually thought that I was the criminal ? "
51501	51518	51226	51226	he	1044	" I did not know who you were , but I was determined to find out . "
51519	51560	51281	51281	I	0	" Excellent , Watson ! And how did you localize me ? You saw me , perhaps , on the night of the convict hunt , when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me ? "
51561	51569	51226	51226	he	1044	" Yes , I saw you then . "
51570	51586	51281	51281	I	0	" And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one ? "
51587	51606	51226	51226	he	1044	" No , your boy had been observed , and that gave me a guide where to look . "
51607	51635	51636	51636	He	1132	" The old gentleman with the telescope , no doubt . I could not make it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens . "
51644	51673	51636	51636	He	1132	" Ha , I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies . What 's this paper ? So you have been to Coombe Tracey , have you ? "
51674	51677	51226	51226	he	1044	" Yes . "
51678	51685	51636	51636	He	1132	" To see Mrs. Laura Lyons ? "
51686	51689	51226	51226	he	1044	" Exactly . "
51690	51723	51636	51636	He	1132	" Well done ! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines , and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case . "
51724	51788	51226	51226	he	1044	" Well , I am glad from my heart that you are here , for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves . But how in the name of wonder did you come here , and what have you been doing ? I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that case of blackmailing . "
51789	51799	51636	51636	He	1132	" That was what I wished you to think . "
51800	51813	51814	51814	I	0	" Then you use me , and yet do not trust me ! "
51820	51834	51814	51814	I	0	" I think that I have deserved better at your hands , Holmes . "
51835	52000	51636	51636	He	1132	" My dear fellow , you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases , and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a trick upon you . In truth , it was partly for your own sake that I did it , and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself . Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours , and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard . As it is , I have been able to get about as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall , and I remain an unknown factor in the business , ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment . "
52001	52010	51814	51814	I	0	" But why keep me in the dark ? "
52011	52128	51636	51636	He	1132	" For you to know could not have helped us and might possi- bly have led to my discovery . You would have wished to tell me something , or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other , and so an unnecessary risk would be run . I brought Cartwright down with me - you remember the little chap at the express office - and he has seen after my simple wants : a loaf of bread and a clean collar . What does man want more ? He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet , and both have been invaluable . "
52129	52138	52140	52140	My	0	" Then my reports have all been wasted ! "
52169	52226	52166	52166	his	96	" Here are your reports , my dear fellow , and very well thumbed , I assure you . I made excellent arrangements , and they are only delayed one day upon their way . I must compliment you ex- ceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case . "
52292	52297	52299	52299	he	96	" That 's better , "
52309	52392	52299	52299	he	96	" And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons - it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone , for I am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter . In fact , if you had not gone to - day it is exceedingly probable that I should have gone to - morrow . "
52454	52460	52462	52462	he	96	" This is most important , "
52468	52506	52462	52462	he	96	" It fills up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair . You are aware , perhaps , that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man Stapleton ? "
52507	52517	52439	52439	he	96	" I did not know of a close intimacy . "
52518	52564	52462	52462	he	96	" There can be no doubt about the matter . They meet , they write , there is a complete understanding between them . Now , this puts a very powerful weapon into our hands . If I could only use it to detach his wife "
52565	52569	52439	52439	he	96	" His wife ? "
52570	52604	52462	52462	he	96	" I am giving you some information now , in return for all that you have given me . The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality his wife . "
52605	52633	52439	52439	he	96	" Good heavens , Holmes ! Are you sure of what you say ? How could he have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her ? "
52634	52684	52462	52462	he	96	" Sir Henry 's falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir Henry . He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her , as you have yourself observed . I repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister . "
52685	52692	52439	52439	he	96	" But why this elaborate deception ? "
52693	52715	52462	52462	he	96	" Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman . "
52774	52795	52821	52832	The shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed	1142	" It is he , then , who is our enemy - it is he who dogged us in London ? "
52796	52803	52821	52832	The shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed	1142	" So I read the riddle . "
52804	52816	52821	52832	The shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed	1142	" And the warning - it must have come from her ! "
52817	52820	52821	52832	The shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed	1142	" Exactly . "
52845	52866	52821	52832	The shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed	1142	" But are you sure of this , Holmes ? How do you know that the woman is his wife ? "
52867	53004	52821	52832	The shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed	1142	" Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you , and I dare say he has many a time regretted it since . He was once a schoolmaster in the north of England . Now , there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster . There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession . A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances , and that the man who had owned it - the name was different - had disappeared with his wife . The descriptions agreed . When I learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete . "
53019	53037	53038	53038	I	0	" If this woman is in truth his wife , where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come in ? "
53041	53104	52821	52832	The shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed	1142	" That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light . Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much . I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband . In that case , regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man , she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife . "
53105	53112	52821	52832	The shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed	1142	" And when she is undeceived ? "
53113	53168	52821	52832	The shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed	1142	" Why , then we may find the lady of service . It must be our first duty to see her - both of us - to - morrow . Do n't you think , Watson , that you are away from your charge rather long ? Your place should be at Baskerville Hall . "
53198	53205	53206	53206	I	0	" One last question , Holmes , "
53212	53238	53206	53206	I	0	" Surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me . What is the meaning of it all ? What is he after ? "
53247	53382	53244	53244	he	96	" It is murder , Watson - refined , cold - blooded , deliberate mur- der . Do not ask me for particulars . My nets are closing upon him , even as his are upon Sir Henry , and with your help he is already almost at my mercy . There is but one danger which can threaten us . It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so . Another day - two at the most - and I have my case com- plete , but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child . Your mission to - day has justi- fied itself , and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his side . Hark ! "
53415	53421	53422	53422	I	0	" Oh , my God ! "
53425	53435	53422	53422	I	0	" What is it ? What does it mean ? "
53474	53477	53478	53478	he	96	" Hush ! "
53481	53484	53478	53478	he	96	" Hush ! "
53526	53531	53532	53532	Holmes	96	" Where is it ? "
53558	53565	53545	53545	he	96	" Where is it , Watson ? "
53566	53572	53573	53573	I	0	" There , I think . "
53579	53584	53573	53573	I	0	" No , there ! "
53634	53638	53640	53640	Holmes	96	" The hound ! "
53642	53658	53640	53640	Holmes	96	" Come , Watson , come ! Great heavens , if we are too late ! "
53744	53757	53736	53736	He	96	" He has beaten us , Watson . We are too late . "
53758	53766	53736	53736	He	96	" No , no , surely not ! "
53767	53805	53736	53736	He	96	" Fool that I was to hold my hand . And you , Watson , see what comes of abandoning your charge ! But , by Heaven , if the worst has happened we 'll avenge him ! "
53871	53877	53848	53848	Holmes	96	" Can you see anything ? "
53878	53881	53848	53848	Holmes	96	" Nothing . "
53882	53891	53848	53848	Holmes	96	" But , hark , what is that ? "
54185	54192	54193	54193	I	0	" The brute ! the brute ! "
54199	54216	54193	54193	I	0	" Oh Holmes , I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate . "
54217	54291	54173	54173	Holmes	96	" I am more to blame than you , Watson . In order to have my case well rounded and complete , I have thrown away the life of my client . It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career . But how could I know - how could l know - that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings ? "
54292	54356	54193	54193	I	0	" That we should have heard his screams - my God , those screams ! - and yet have been unable to save him ! Where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death ? It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant . And Stapleton , where is he ? He shall answer for this deed . "
54357	54474	54173	54173	Holmes	96	" He shall . I will see to that . Uncle and nephew have been murdered - the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatural , the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it . But now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast . Save from what we heard , we can not even swear to the existence of the latter , since Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall . But , by heavens , cunning as he is , the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past ! "
54595	54605	54758	54758	He	1165	" Why should we not seize him at once ? "
54606	54650	54698	54699	the body	1164	" Our case is not complete . The fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree . It is not what we know , but what we can prove . If we make one false move the villain may escape us yet . "
54651	54657	54758	54758	He	1165	" What can we do ? "
54658	54686	54698	54699	the body	1164	" There will be plenty for us to do to - morrow . To - night we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend . "
54729	54757	54758	54758	He	1165	" We must send for help , Holmes ! We can not carry him all the way to the Hall . Good heavens , are you mad ? "
54798	54811	54770	54770	he	1165	" A beard ! A beard ! The man has a beard ! "
54812	54816	54758	54758	He	1165	" A beard ? "
54817	54837	54770	54770	he	1165	" It is not the baronet - it is - why , it is my neighbour , the convict ! "
55003	55015	55017	55017	he	96	" Then the clothes have been the poor devil 's death , "
55019	55087	55017	55017	he	96	" It is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir Henry 's - the boot which was abstracted in the hotel , in all probability - and so ran this man down . There is one very singular thing , however : How came Selden , in the dark- ness , to know that the hound was on his trail ? "
55088	55093	55372	55373	A figure	1172	" He heard him . "
55094	55153	55017	55017	he	96	" To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help . By his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track . How did he know ? "
55154	55173	55372	55373	A figure	1172	" A greater mystery to me is why this hound , presuming that all our conjectures are correct - "
55174	55179	55017	55017	he	96	" I presume nothing . "
55180	55227	55372	55373	A figure	1172	" Well , then , why this hound should be loose to - night . I suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor . Stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there . "
55228	55290	55017	55017	he	96	" My difficulty is the more formidable of the two , for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours , while mine may remain forever a mystery . The question now is , what shall we do with this poor wretch 's body ? We can not leave it here to the foxes and the ravens . "
55291	55311	55372	55373	A figure	1172	" I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police . "
55312	55371	55017	55017	he	96	" Exactly . I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far . Halloa , Watson , what 's this ? It 's the man himself , by all that 's wonderful and audacious ! Not a word to show yow suspicions - not a word , or my plans crumble to the ground . "
55425	55487	55488	55488	He	1172	" Why , Dr. Watson , that 's not you , is it ? You are the last man that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night . But , dear me , what 's this ? Somebody hurt ? Not - do n't tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry ! "
55515	55522	55523	55523	he	1172	" Who - who 's this ? "
55526	55538	55523	55523	he	1172	" It is Selden , the man who escaped from Princetown . "
55569	55584	55561	55561	He	1172	" Dear me ! What a very shocking affair ! How did he die ? "
55585	55614	55561	55561	He	1172	" He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks . My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry . "
55615	55636	55561	55561	He	1172	" I heard a cry also . That was what brought me out . I was uneasy about Sir Henry . "
55637	55645	55646	55646	I	0	" Why about Sir Henry in particular ? "
55652	55691	55693	55693	his	1178	" Because I had suggested that he should come over . When he did not come I was surprised , and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I heard cries upon the moor . By the way "
55704	55714	55693	55693	his	1178	" did you hear anything else besides a cry ? "
55715	55718	55720	55720	Holmes	96	" No , "
55722	55726	55720	55720	Holmes	96	" did you ? "
55727	55730	55693	55693	his	1178	" No . "
55731	55739	55720	55720	Holmes	96	" What do you mean , then ? "
55740	55788	55693	55693	his	1178	" Oh , you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound , and so on . It is said to be heard at night upon the moor . I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound to - night . "
55789	55797	55799	55799	I.	0	" We heard nothing of the kind , "
55800	55813	55693	55693	his	1178	" And what is your theory of this poor fellow 's death ? "
55814	55850	55693	55693	his	1178	" I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head . He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck . "
55851	55859	55861	55861	Stapleton	147	" That seems the most reasonable theory , "
55876	55888	55864	55864	he	1179	" What do you think about it , Mr. Sherlock Holmes ? "
55895	55902	55904	55904	he	1476	" You are quick at identification , "
55906	55930	55904	55904	he	1476	" We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down . You are in time to see a tragedy . "
55931	55965	55873	55873	his	1179	" Yes , indeed . I have no doubt that my friend 's explanation will cover the facts . I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me to - morrow . "
55966	55975	55904	55904	he	1476	" Oh , you return to - morrow ? "
55976	55982	55873	55873	his	1179	" That is my intention . "
55983	56000	55904	55904	he	1476	" I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us ? "
56006	56037	56001	56001	Holmes	96	" One can not always have the success for which one hopes . An investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours . It has not been a satisfactory case . "
56063	56111	56058	56058	he	1476	" I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house , but it would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it . I think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning . "
56189	56198	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" We 're at close grips at last , "
56209	56276	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" What a nerve the fellow has ! How he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot . I told you in London , Watson , and I tell you now again , that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel . "
56277	56287	56186	56188	Fixing the Nets	161	" I am sorry that he has seen you . "
56288	56305	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" And so was I at first . But there was no getting out of it . "
56306	56326	56186	56188	Fixing the Nets	161	" What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here ? "
56327	56371	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" It may cause him to be more cautious , or it may drive him to desperate measures at once . Like most clever criminals , he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us . "
56372	56382	56186	56188	Fixing the Nets	161	" Why should we not arrest him at once ? "
56383	56495	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" My dear Watson , you were born to be a man of action . Your instinct is always to do something energetic . But supposing , for argument 's sake , that we had him arrested to - night , what on earth the better off should we be for that ? We could prove nothing against him . There 's the devilish cunning of it ! If he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence , but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master . "
56496	56503	56186	56188	Fixing the Nets	161	" Surely we have a case . "
56504	56534	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" Not a shadow of one - only surmise and conjecture . We should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence . "
56535	56543	56186	56188	Fixing the Nets	161	" There is Sir Charles 's death . "
56544	56645	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" Found dead without a mark upon him . You and I know that he died of sheer fright , and we know also what frightened him but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it ? What signs are there of a hound ? Where are the marks of its fangs ? Of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him . But we have to prove all this , and we are not in a position to do it . "
56646	56655	56186	56188	Fixing the Nets	161	" Well , then , to - night ? "
56656	56754	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" We are not much better off to - night . Again , there was no direct connection between the hound and the man 's death . We never saw the hound . We heard it , but we could not prove that it was running upon this man 's trail . There is a complete absence of motive . No , my dear fellow ; we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present , and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one . "
56755	56765	56186	56188	Fixing the Nets	161	" And how do you propose to do so ? "
56766	56826	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her . And I have my own plan as well . Sufficient for to - morrow is the evil thereof ; but I hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last . "
56850	56856	56186	56188	Fixing the Nets	161	" Are you coming up ? "
56857	56937	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" Yes ; I see no reason for further concealment . But one last word , Watson . Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry . Let him think that Selden 's death was as Stapleton would have us be- lieve . He will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo to - morrow , when he is engaged , if I remember your report aright , to dine with these people . "
56938	56943	56186	56188	Fixing the Nets	161	" And so am I. "
56944	56984	56200	56200	Holmes	96	" Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone . That will be easily arranged . And now , if we are too late for dinner , I think that we are both ready for our suppers . "
57163	57181	57183	57184	the baronet	292	" I 've been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the morning , "
57186	57233	57183	57184	the baronet	292	" I guess I should have some credit , for I have kept my promise . If I had n't sworn not to go about alone I might have had a more lively evening , for I had a message from Stapleton asking me over there . "
57234	57249	57251	57251	Holmes	96	" I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening , "
57254	57278	57251	57251	Holmes	96	" By the way , I do n't suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck ? "
57285	57290	57279	57280	Sir Henry	115	" How was that ? "
57291	57318	57183	57184	the baronet	292	" This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes . I fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police . "
57319	57339	57279	57280	Sir Henry	115	" That is unlikely . There was no mark on any of them , as far as I know . "
57340	57401	57183	57184	the baronet	292	" That 's lucky for him - in fact , it 's lucky for all of you , since you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter . I am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household . Watson 's reports are most incriminating documents . "
57402	57409	57411	57412	the baronet	292	" But how about the case ? "
57414	57441	57411	57412	the baronet	292	" Have you made anything out of the tangle ? I do n't know that Watson and I are much the wiser since we came down . "
57442	57494	57183	57184	the baronet	292	" I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long . It has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business . There are several points upon which we still want light - but it is coming all the same . "
57495	57579	57411	57412	the baronet	292	" We 've had one experience , as Watson has no doubt told you . We heard the hound on the moor , so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition . I had something to do with dogs when I was out West , and I know one when I hear one . If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I 'll be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time . "
57580	57600	57183	57184	the baronet	292	" I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help . "
57601	57612	57411	57412	the baronet	292	" Whatever you tell me to do I will do . "
57613	57634	57183	57184	the baronet	292	" Very good ; and I will ask you also to do it blindly , without always asking the reason . "
57635	57641	57411	57412	the baronet	292	" Just as you like . "
57642	57666	57183	57184	the baronet	292	" If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem will soon be solved . I have no doubt "
57717	57722	57723	57723	we	1202	" What is it ? "
57756	57764	57766	57766	he	1200	" Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur , "
57783	57819	57768	57768	he	1200	" Watson wo n't allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ . Now , these are a really very fine series of portraits . "
57820	57832	57834	57835	Sir Henry	115	" Well , I 'm glad to hear you say so , "
57845	57887	57834	57835	Sir Henry	115	" I do n't pretend to know much about these things , and I 'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture . I did n't know that you found time for such things . "
57888	57945	57768	57768	he	1200	" I know what is good when I see it , and I see it now . That 's a Kneller , I 'll swear , that lady in the blue silk over yonder , and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds . They are all family portraits , I presume ? "
57946	57950	57834	57835	Sir Henry	115	" Every one . "
57951	57958	57768	57768	he	1200	" Do you know the names ? "
57959	57979	57834	57835	Sir Henry	115	" Barrymore has been coaching me in them , and I think I can say my lessons fairly well . "
57980	57989	57768	57768	he	1200	" Who is the gentleman with the telescope ? "
57990	58037	57834	57835	Sir Henry	115	" That is Rear - Admiral Baskerville , who served under Rodney in the West Indies . The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William Baskerville , who was Chairman of Commit- tees of the House of Commons under Pitt . "
58038	58056	57768	57768	he	1200	" And this Cavalier opposite to me - the one with the black velvet and the lace ? "
58057	58098	57834	57835	Sir Henry	115	" Ah , you have a right to know about him . That is the cause of all the mischief , the wicked Hugo , who started the Hound of the Baskervilles . We 're not likely to forget him . "
58110	58114	58116	58116	Holmes	96	" Dear me ! "
58118	58156	58116	58116	Holmes	96	" he seems a quiet , meek - mannered man enough , but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes . I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person . "
58157	58183	58184	58184	Holmes	96	" There 's no doubt about the authenticity , for the name and the date , 1647 , are on the back of the canvas . "
58275	58282	58261	58261	he	115	" Do you see anything there ? "
58347	58355	58398	58398	he	115	" Is it like anyone you know ? "
58356	58367	58398	58398	he	115	" There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw . "
58368	58380	58381	58381	He	115	" Just a suggestion , perhaps . But wait an instant ! "
58413	58417	58418	58418	I	0	" Good heavens ! "
58434	58472	58398	58398	he	115	" Ha , you see it now . My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings . It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise . "
58473	58485	58398	58398	he	115	" But this is marvellous . It might be his portrait . "
58486	58535	58398	58398	he	115	" Yes , it is an interesting instance of a throwback , which appears to be both physical and spiritual . A study of family portraits is enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarna- tion . The fellow is a Baskerville - that is evident . "
58536	58543	58398	58398	he	115	" With designs upon the succession . "
58544	58620	58621	58621	He	1207	" Exactly . This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links . We have him , Watson , we have him , and I dare swear that before to - morrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies . A pin , a cork , and a card , and we add him to the Baker Street collection ! "
58684	58697	58698	58698	he	96	" Yes , we should have a full day to - day , "
58712	58755	58702	58702	he	96	" The nets are all in place , and the drag is about to begin . We 'll know before the day is out whether we have caught our big , leanjawed pike , or whether he has got through the meshes . "
58756	58765	58674	58674	him	96	" Have you been on the moor already ? "
58766	58845	58702	58702	he	96	" I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of Selden . I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter . And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright , who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut , as a dog does at his master 's grave , if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety . "
58846	58853	58674	58674	him	96	" What is the next move ? "
58854	58866	58702	58702	he	96	" To see Sir Henry . Ah , here he is ! "
58867	58874	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" Good - morning , Holmes , "
58879	58897	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" You look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff . "
58898	58911	58702	58702	he	96	" That is the exact situation . Watson was asking for orders . "
58912	58917	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" And so do I. "
58918	58941	58702	58702	he	96	" Very good . You are engaged , as I understand , to dine with our friends the Stapletons to - night . "
58942	58971	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" I hope that you will come also . They are very hospitable people , and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you . "
58972	58984	58702	58702	he	96	" I fear that Watson and I must go to London . "
58985	58989	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" To London ? "
58990	59007	58702	58702	he	96	" Yes , I think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture . "
59015	59044	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" I hoped that you were going to see me through this business . The Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone . "
59045	59109	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" My dear fellow , you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell you . You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come with you , but that urgent business required us to be in town . We hope very soon to return to Devonshire . Will you remember to give them that message ? "
59110	59117	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" If you insist upon it . "
59118	59128	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" There is no alternative , I assure you . "
59150	59158	59159	59159	he	292	" When do you desire to go ? "
59163	59214	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" Immediately after breakfast . We will drive in to Coombe Tracey , but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you . Watson , you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret that you can not come . "
59215	59228	59230	59231	the baronet	292	" I have a good mind to go to London with you , "
59233	59241	59230	59231	the baronet	292	" Why should I stay here alone ? "
59242	59273	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" Because it is your post of duty . Because you gave me your word that you would do as you were told , and I tell you to stay . "
59274	59284	59230	59231	the baronet	292	" All right , then , I 'll stay . "
59285	59316	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" One more direction ! I wish you to drive to Merripit House Send back your trap , however , and let them know that you intend to walk home . "
59317	59324	59230	59231	the baronet	292	" To walk across the moor ? "
59325	59328	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" Yes . "
59329	59347	59230	59231	the baronet	292	" But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do . "
59348	59385	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" This time you may do it with safety . If I had not every confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it , but it is essential that you should do it . "
59386	59393	59230	59231	the baronet	292	" Then I will do it . "
59394	59432	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the Grimpen Road , and is your natural way home . "
59433	59442	59230	59231	the baronet	292	" I will do just what you say . "
59443	59470	58876	58877	the baronet	292	" Very good . I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible , so as to reach London in the afternoon . "
59597	59603	59588	59590	A small boy	1219	" Any orders , sir ? "
59604	59657	59680	59681	The boy	2252	" You will take this train to town , Cartwright . The moment you arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville , in my name , to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is to send it by registered post to Baker Street . "
59658	59663	59588	59590	A small boy	1219	" Yes , sir . "
59664	59679	59680	59681	The boy	2252	" And ask at the station office if there is a message for me . "
59712	59766	59767	59767	His	96	" That is in answer to mine of this morning . He is the best of the professionals , I think , and we may need his assistance . Now , Watson , I think that we can not employ our time better than by calling upon your acquaintance , Mrs. Laura Lyons . "
59871	59888	59890	59890	he	96	" I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late Sir Charles Baskerville , "
59892	59923	59890	59890	he	96	" My friend here , Dr. Watson , has informed me of what you have communi- cated , and also of what you have withheld in connection with that matter . "
59924	59930	59931	59931	she	152	" What have I withheld ? "
59935	59977	59890	59890	he	96	" You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten o'clock . We know that that was the place and hour of his death . You have withheld what the connection is between these events . "
59978	59984	60091	60092	Mrs. Lyons	152	" There is no connection . "
59985	60052	59890	59890	he	96	" In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one . But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a connec- tion , after all . I wish to be perfectly frank with you , Mrs. Lyons . We regard this case as one of murder , and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his wife as well . "
60060	60064	60065	60065	she	590	" His wife ! "
60068	60090	60091	60092	Mrs. Lyons	152	" The fact is no longer a secret . The person who has passed for his sister is really his wife . "
60125	60129	60130	60130	she	590	" His wife ! "
60134	60145	60130	60130	she	590	" His wife ! He is not a married man . "
60152	60171	60176	60176	her	152	" Prove it to me ! Prove it to me ! And if you can do so - ! "
60184	60193	60195	60195	Holmes	96	" I have come prepared to do so , "
60204	60289	60195	60195	Holmes	96	" Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four years ago . It is indorsed ' Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur , ' but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him , and her also , if you know her by sight . Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur , who at that time kept St. Oliver 's private school . Read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people . "
60311	60315	60316	60316	she	152	" Mr. Holmes , "
60319	60474	60316	60316	she	152	" this man had offered me marriage on condition that I could get a divorce from my husband . He has lied to me , the villain , in every conceivable way . Not one word of truth has he ever told me . And why - why ? I imagined that all was for my own sake . But now I see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands . Why should I preserve faith with him who never kept any with me ? Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts ? Ask me what you like , and there is nothing which I shall hold back . One thing I swear to you , and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman , who had been my kindest friend . "
60475	60483	60485	60486	Sherlock Holmes	96	" I entirely believe you , madam , "
60488	60539	60316	60316	she	152	" The recital of these events must be very painful to you , and perhaps it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred , and you can check me if I make any material mistake . The sending of this letter was suggested to you by Stapleton ? "
60540	60545	60316	60316	she	152	" He dictated it . "
60546	60572	60316	60316	she	152	" I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce ? "
60573	60576	60316	60316	she	152	" Exactly . "
60577	60594	60316	60316	she	152	" And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment ? "
60595	60643	60316	60316	she	152	" He told me that it would hurt his self - respect that any other man should find the money for such an object , and that though he was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us . "
60644	60671	60316	60316	she	152	" He appears to be a very consistent character . And then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper ? "
60672	60675	60316	60316	she	152	" No . "
60676	60693	60316	60316	she	152	" And he made you swear to say nothing about your appoint- ment with Sir Charles ? "
60694	60729	60316	60316	she	152	" He did . He said that the death was a very mysterious one , and that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out . He frightened me into remaining silent . "
60730	60740	60316	60316	she	152	" Quite so . But you had your suspicions ? "
60747	60752	60753	60753	she	1229	" I knew him , "
60756	60774	60753	60753	she	1229	" But if he had kept faith with me I should always have done so with him . "
60775	60789	60791	60792	Sherlock Holmes	96	" I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape , "
60794	60855	60791	60792	Sherlock Holmes	96	" You have had him in your power and he knew it , and yet you are alive . You have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice . We must wish you good - morning now , Mrs. Lyons , and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again . "
60856	60874	60876	60876	Holmes	96	" Our case becomes rounded off , and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us , "
60890	60999	60876	60876	Holmes	96	" I shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times . Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in Godno , in Little Russia , in the year ' 66 , and of course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina , but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own . Even now we have no clear case against this very wily man . But I shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night . "
61087	61091	61092	61092	he	166	" Anything good ? "
61095	61102	61104	61104	Holmes	96	" The biggest thing for years , "
61106	61175	61104	61104	Holmes	96	" We have two hours before we need think of starting . I think we might employ it in getting some dinner and then , Lestrade , we will take the London fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor . Never been there ? Ah , well , I do n't suppose you will forget your first visit . "
61514	61521	61613	61614	the detective	1257	" Are you armed , Lestrade ? "
61527	61558	61522	61524	The little detective	1256	" As long as I have my trousers I have a hip - pocket , and as long as I have my hip - pocket I have something in it . "
61559	61572	61613	61614	the detective	1257	" Good ! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies . "
61573	61591	61522	61524	The little detective	1256	" You 're mighty close about this affair , Mr. Holmes . What 's the game now ? "
61592	61597	61613	61614	the detective	1257	" A waiting game . "
61598	61611	61613	61614	the detective	1257	" My word , it does not seem a very cheerful place , "
61643	61655	61613	61614	the detective	1257	" I see the lights of a house ahead of us . "
61656	61684	61685	61685	We	1262	" That is Merripit House and the end of our journey . I must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper . "
61714	61719	61721	61721	he	96	" This will do , "
61723	61734	61721	61721	he	96	" These rocks upon the right make an admirable screen . "
61735	61742	61613	61614	the detective	1257	" We are to wait here ? "
61743	61792	61721	61721	he	96	" Yes , we shall make our little ambush here . Get into this hollow , Lestrade . You have been inside the house , have you not , Watson ? Can you tell the position of the rooms ? What are those latticed windows at this end ? "
61793	61802	61613	61614	the detective	1257	" I think they are the kitchen windows . "
61803	61814	61721	61721	he	96	" And the one beyond , which shines so brightly ? "
61815	61824	61613	61614	the detective	1257	" That is certainly the dining - room . "
61825	61865	61721	61721	he	96	" The blinds are up . You know the lie of the land best . Creep forward quietly and see what they are doing - but for heaven 's sake do n't let them know that they are watched ! "
62143	62156	62157	62157	Holmes	96	" You say , Watson , that the lady is not there ? "
62166	62169	62157	62157	Holmes	96	" No . "
62170	62191	62157	62157	Holmes	96	" Where can she be , then , since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen ? "
62192	62201	62157	62157	Holmes	96	" I can not think where she is . "
62296	62305	62286	62286	he	96	" It 's moving towards us , Watson . "
62306	62311	62286	62286	he	96	" Is that serious ? "
62312	62365	62286	62286	he	96	" Very serious , indeed - the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans . He ca n't be very long , now . It is already ten o'clock . Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path . "
62609	62645	62591	62591	his	96	" If he is n't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered . In half an hour we wo n't be able to see our hands in front of us . "
62646	62656	62591	62591	his	96	" Shall we move farther back upon higher ground ? "
62657	62668	62591	62591	his	96	" Yes , I think it would be as well . "
62713	62720	62722	62722	Holmes	96	" We are going too far , "
62724	62753	62754	62754	He	96	" We dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us . At all costs we must hold our ground where we are . "
62767	62779	62754	62754	He	96	" Thank God , I think that I hear him coming . "
62896	62899	62901	62901	Holmes	96	" Hist ! "
62915	62923	62901	62901	Holmes	96	" Look out ! It 's coming ! "
63568	63572	63573	63573	he	166	" My God ! "
63576	63591	63573	63573	he	166	" What was it ? What , in heaven 's name , was it ? "
63592	63601	63603	63603	Holmes	96	" It 's dead , whatever it is , "
63605	63616	63603	63603	Holmes	96	" We 've laid the family ghost once and forever . "
63730	63733	63734	63734	I	0	" Phosphorus , "
63737	63744	63746	63746	Holmes	96	" A cunning preparation of it , "
63754	63814	63746	63746	Holmes	96	" There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent . We owe you a deep apology , Sir Henry , for having exposed you to this fright . I was prepared for a hound , but not for such a creature as this . And the fog gave us little time to receive him . "
63815	63822	63909	63909	He	1322	" You have saved my life . "
63823	63836	63746	63746	Holmes	96	" Having first endangered it . Are you strong enough to stand ? "
63837	63871	63909	63909	He	1322	" Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for anything . So ! Now , if you will help me up . What do you propose to do ? "
63872	63908	63746	63746	Holmes	96	" To leave you here . You are not fit for further adventures to - night . If you will wait , one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall . "
63948	63955	63957	63957	Holmes	96	" We must leave you now , "
63959	63988	63957	63957	Holmes	96	" The rest of our work must be done , and every moment is of importance . We have our case , and now we only want our man .
63989	64004	64005	64005	he	96	" It 's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house , "
64017	64030	64005	64005	he	96	" Those shots must have told him that the game was up . "
64031	64046	64005	64005	he	96	" We were some distance off , and this fog may have deadened them . "
64047	64085	64005	64005	he	96	" He followed the hound to call him off - of that you may be certain . No , no , he 's gone by this time ! But we 'll search the house and make sure . "
64172	64179	64181	64181	Lestrade	166	" There 's someone in here , "
64183	64194	64181	64181	Lestrade	166	" I can hear a movement . Open this door ! "
64496	64500	64502	64502	Holmes	96	" The brute ! "
64504	64529	64502	64502	Holmes	96	" Here , Lestrade , your brandy- bottle ! Put her in the chair ! She has fainted from ill - usage and exhaustion . "
64536	64541	64542	64542	she	171	" Is he safe ? "
64545	64550	64542	64542	she	171	" Has he escaped ? "
64551	64560	64597	64597	She	171	" He can not escape us , madam . "
64561	64580	64542	64542	she	171	" No , no , I did not mean my husband . Sir Henry ? Is he safe ? "
64581	64584	64597	64597	She	171	" Yes . "
64585	64590	64542	64542	she	171	" And the hound ? "
64591	64596	64597	64597	She	171	" It is dead . "
64605	64624	64625	64625	She	171	" Thank God ! Thank God ! Oh , this villain ! See how he has treated me ! "
64647	64720	64721	64721	She	171	" But this is nothing - nothing ! It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled . I could endure it all , ill - usage , solitude , a life of deception , everything , as long as I could still cling to the hope that I had his love , but now I know that in this also I have been his dupe and his tool . "
64730	64740	64742	64742	Holmes	96	" You bear him no good will , madam , "
64744	64770	64742	64742	Holmes	96	" Tell us then where we shall find him . If you have ever aided him in evil , help us now and so atone . "
64771	64783	64784	64784	she	171	" There is but one place where he can have fled , "
64788	64835	64784	64784	she	171	" There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire . It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge . That is where he would fly . "
64855	64858	64860	64860	he	96	" See , "
64862	64877	64860	64860	he	96	" No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire to - night . "
64893	64905	64906	64906	she	171	" He may find his way in , but never out , "
64909	64964	64906	64906	she	171	" How can he see the guiding wands to - night ? We planted them to- gether , he and I , to mark the pathway through the mire . Oh , if I could only have plucked them out to - day . Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy ! "
65455	65460	65445	65445	He	96	" Meyers , Toronto , "
65468	65476	65478	65478	he	96	" It is worth a mud bath , "
65480	65491	65478	65478	he	96	" It is our friend Sir Henry 's missing boot . "
65492	65501	65445	65445	He	96	" Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight . "
65502	65560	65478	65478	he	96	" Exactly . He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon the track . He fled when he knew the game was up , still clutching it . And he hurled it away at this point of his flight . We know at least that he came so far in safety . "
65799	65803	65805	65805	Holmes	96	" A dog ! "
65807	66096	66098	66098	he	1380	" By Jove , a curly - haired spaniel . Poor Mortimer will never see his pet again . Well , I do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fath- omed . He could hide his hound , but he could not hush its voice , and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear . On an emergency he could keep the hound in the out - house at Merripit , but it was always a risk , and it was only on the supreme day , which he regarded as the end of all his efforts , that he dared do it . This paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed . It was suggested , of course , by the story of the family hell - hound , and by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death . No wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed , even as our friend did , and as we ourselves might have done , when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track . It was a cunning device , for , apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death , what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it , as many have done , upon the moor ? I said it in London , Watson , and I say it again now , that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder "
66406	66413	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" The whole course of events , "
66417	66527	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" from the point of view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct , although to us , who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of the facts , it all appeared exceedingly complex . I have had the advantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton , and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us . You will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my indexed list of cases . "
66528	66545	66382	66382	They	1390	" Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory . "
66546	66705	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" Certainly , though I can not guarantee that I carry all the facts in my mind . Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out what has passed . The barrister who has his case at his fingers ' ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more . So each of my cases displaces the last , and Mlle . Carere has blurred my recollection of Baskerville Hall . To - morrow some other little problem may be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and the infamous Upwood . So far as the case of the hound goes , however , I will give you the course of events as nearly as I can , and you will suggest anything which I may have forgotten .
66706	66988	66382	66382	They	1390	" My inquiries show beyond all question that the family por- trait did not lie , and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville . He was a son of that Rodger Baskerville , the younger brother of Sir Charles , who fled with a sinister reputation to South America , where he was said to have died unmarried . He did , as a matter of fact , marry , and had one child , this fellow , whose real name is the same as his father 's . He married Beryl Garcia , one of the beauties of Costa Rica , and , having purloined a considerable sum of public money , he changed his name to Vandeleur and fled to England , where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire . His reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home , and that he had used this man 's ability to make the undertaking a success . Fraser , the tutor , died however , and the school which had begun well sank from disre- pute into infamy . The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to Stapleton , and he brought the remains of his fortune , his schemes for the future , and his taste for entomology to the south of England . I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject , and that the name of Vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had , in his Yorkshire days , been the first to describe .
66989	67166	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such intense interest to us . The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate . When he went to Devonshire his plans were , I believe , exceedingly hazy , but that he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him in the character of his sister . The idea of using her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind , though he may not have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged . He meant in the end to have the estate , and he was ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end . His first act was to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could , and his second was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and with the neighbours .
67167	67276	66382	66382	They	1390	" The baronet himself told him about the family hound , and so prepared the way for his own death . Stapleton , as I will continue to call him , knew that the old man 's heart was weak and that a shock would kill him . So much he had learned from Dr. Morti- mer . He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously . His ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to death , and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer .
67277	67416	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with considerable finesse . An ordinary schemer would have been content to work with a savage hound . The use of artificial means to make the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part . The dog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles , the dealers in Fulham Road . It was the strongest and most savage in their possession . He brought it down by the North Devon line and walked a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without exciting any remarks . He had already on his insect hunts learned to penetrate the Grimpen Mire , and so had found a safe hiding - place for the creature . Here he kennelled it and waited his chance .
67417	67562	66382	66382	They	1390	" But it was some time coming . The old gentleman could not be decoyed outside of his grounds at night . Several times Stapleton lurked about with his hound , but without avail . It was during these fruitless quests that he , or rather his ally , was seen by peasants , and that the legend of the demon dog received a new confirmation . He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charles to his ruin , but here she proved unexpectedly independent . She would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a senti- mental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy . Threats and even , I am sorry to say , blows refused to move her . She would have nothing to do with it , and for a time Stapleton was at a deadlock .
67563	67746	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that Sir Charles , who had conceived a friendship for him , made him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman , Mrs. Laura Lyons . By representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence over her , and he gave her to understand.that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her . His plans were suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer , with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide . He must act at once , or his victim might get beyond his power . He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to write this letter , imploring the old man to give her an interview on the evening before his departure for London . He then , by a specious argument , prevented her from going , and so had the chance for which he had waited .
67747	67982	66382	66382	They	1390	" Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get his hound , to treat it with his infernal paint , and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting . The dog , incited by its master , sprang over the wicket - gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet , who fled screaming down the yew alley . In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature , with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes , bounding after its victim . He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror . The hound had kept upon the grassy border while the baronet had run down the path , so that no track but the man 's was visible . On seeing him lying still the creature had probably approached to sniff at him , but finding him dead had turned away again . It was then that it left the print which was actually observed by Dr. Mortimer . The hound was called off and hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire , and a mystery was left which puzzled the authorities , alarmed the countryside , and finally brought the case within the scope of our observation .
67983	68157	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville . You perceive the devilish cunning of it , for really it would be almost impossible to make a case against the real murderer . His only accomplice was one who could never give him away , and the grotesque , inconceivable nature of the device only served to make it more effective . Both of the women concerned in the case , Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons , were left with a strong suspicion against Stapleton . Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs upon the old man , and also of the existence of the hound . Mrs. Lyons knew neither of these things , but had been impressed by the death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only known to him . However , both of them were under his influence , and he had nothing to fear from them . The first half of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult still remained .
68158	68463	66382	66382	They	1390	" It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in Canada . In any case he would very soon learn it from his friend Dr. Mortimer , and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of Henry Baskerville . Stapleton 's first idea was that this young stranger from Canada might possibly be done to death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all . He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man , and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her . It was for this reason that he took her to London with him . They lodged , I find , at the Mexborough Private Hotel , in Craven Street , which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence . Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he , disguised in a beard , followed Dr. Mortimer to Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the North- umberland Hotel . His wife had some inkling of his plans ; but she had such a fear of her husband - a fear founded upon brutal ill - treatment - that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger . If the letter should fall into Stapleton 's hands her own life would not be safe . Eventually , as we know , she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message , and addressing the letter in a disguised hand . It reached the baronet , and gave him the first warning of his danger .
68464	68665	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry 's attire so that , in case he was driven to use the dog , he might always have the means of setting him upon his track . With characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once , and we can not doubt that the boots or chamber - maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him in his design . By chance , however , the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and , therefore , useless for his purpose . He then had it returned and obtained another - a most instructive incident , since it proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound , as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new one . The more outre and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined , and the very point which appears to complicate a case is , when duly considered and scientifically handled , the one which is most likely to elucidate it .
68666	68818	66382	66382	They	1390	" Then we had the visit from our friends next morning , shad- owed always by Stapleton in the cab . From his knowledge of our rooms and of my appearance , as well as from his general con- duct , I am inclined to think that Stapleton 's career of crime has been by no means limited to this single Baskerville affair . It is suggestive that during the last three years there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country , for none of which was any criminal ever arrested . The last of these , at Folkestone Court , in May , was remarkable for the cold - blooded pistolling of the page , who surprised the masked and solitary burglar . I can not doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion , and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man .
68819	68895	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got away from us so successfully , and also of his audacity in sending back my own name to me through the cabman . From that moment he understood that I had taken over the case in London , and that therefore there was no chance for him there . He returned to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet . "
68896	68900	68902	68902	I.	1393	" One moment ! "
68903	68940	68902	68902	I.	1393	" You have , no doubt , described the sequence of events correctly , but there is one point which you have left unexplained . What became of the hound when its master was in London ? "
68941	69155	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubt- edly of importance . There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant , though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing all his plans with him . There was an old manservant at Merripit House , whose name was Anthony . His connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years , as far back as the schoolmastering days , so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and wife . This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country . It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England , while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish - American coun- tries . The man , like Mrs. Stapleton herself , spoke good English , but with a curious lisping accent . I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked out . It is very probable , therefore , that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the hound , though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast was used .
69156	69332	68902	68902	I.	1393	" The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire , whither they were soon followed by Sir Henry and you . One word now as to how I stood myself at that time . It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close inspection for the water- mark . In doing so I held it within a few inches of my eyes , and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine . There are seventy - five perfumes , which it is very necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other , and cases have more than once within my own experience depended upon their prompt recognition . The scent suggested the presence of a lady , and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons . Thus I had made certain of the hound , and had guessed at the criminal before ever we went to the west country .
69333	69508	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" It was my game to watch Stapleton . It was evident , how- ever , that I could not do this if I were with you , since he would be keenly on his guard . I deceived everybody , therefore , your- self included , and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London . My hardships were not so great as you imagined , though such trifling details must never interfere with the investi- gation of a case . I stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey , and only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of action . Cartwright had come down with me , and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance to me . I was dependent upon him for food and clean linen . When I was watching Stapleton , Cartwright was frequently watching you , so that I was able to keep my hand upon all the strings .
69509	69624	68902	68902	I.	1393	" I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly , being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey . They were of great service to me , and especially that one inci- dentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton 's . I was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how I stood . The case had been considerably compli- cated through the incident of the escaped convict and the rela- tions between him and the Barrymores . This also you cleared up in a very effective way , though I had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations .
69625	69887	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete knowledge of the whole business , but I had not a case which could go to a jury . Even Stapleton 's attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving murder against our man . There seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red - handed , and to do so we had to use Sir Henry , alone and apparently unprotected , as a bait . We did so , and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton to his destruction . That Sir Henry should have been exposed to this is , I must confess , a reproach to my management of the case , but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast presented , nor could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice . We succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a tempo- rary one . A long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feel- ings . His love for the lady was deep and sincere , and to him the saddest part of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her .

There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear , or very possibly both , since they are by no means incom- patible emotions . It was , at least , absolutely effective . At his command she consented to pass as his sister , though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder . She was ready to warn Sir Henry so far as she could without implicating her husband , and again and again she tried to do so . Stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy , and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady , even though it was part of his own plan , still he could not help interrupting with a passionate out- burst which revealed the fiery soul which his self - contained manner so cleverly concealed . By encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit House and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired . On the day of the crisis , however , his wife turned suddenly against him . She had learned something of the death of the convict , and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner . She taxed her husband with his intended crime , and a furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a rival in his love . Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred , and he saw that she would betray him . He tied her up , therefore , that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry , and he hoped , no doubt , that when the whole countryside put down the baronet 's death to the curse of his family , as they certainly would do , he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and to keep silent upon what she knew . In this I fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation , and that , if we had not been there , his doom would none the less have been sealed . A woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an irjury so lightly . And now , my dear Watson , without referring to my notes , I can not give you a more detailed account of this curious case . I do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained . "
70355	70378	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done the old uncle with his bogie hound . "
70379	70412	68902	68902	I.	1393	" The beast was savage and half - starved . If its appearance did not frighten its victim to death , at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offered . "
70413	70466	66415	66415	Holmes	96	" No doubt . There only remains one difficulty . If Stapleton came into the succession , how could he explain the fact that he , the heir , had been living unannounced under another name so close to the property ? How could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry ? "
70467	70719	68902	68902	I.	1393	" It is a fomlidable difficulty , and I fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it . The past and the present are within the field of my inquiry , but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer . Mrs. Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions . There were three possible courses . He might claim the property from South America , establish his identity before the British authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England at all , or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in London ; or , again , he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers , putting him in as heir , and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income . We can not doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty . And now , my dear Watson , we have had some weeks of severe work , and for one evening , I think , we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels . I have a box for ' Les Huguenots . ' Have you heard the De Reszkes ? Might I trouble you then to be ready in half an hour , and we can stop at Marcini 's for a little dinner on the way ? "
