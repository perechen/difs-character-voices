2929	3026	3027	3028	Admirable Nelson	276	" But what man could be built to beat Zebedee himself , in an age like this , when yachts and men take the prize by profundity of false keel ? Tugwell yearned for no hot speed in his friends , or his house , or his wife , or his walk , or even his way of thinking . He had seen more harm come from one hour 's hurry than a hundred years of care could cure , and the longer he lived the more loath he grew to disturb the air around him . "

3116	3269	3104	3104	I	0	" It was Saturday now , when Miss Dolly was waiting to see this great performance , of which she considered herself , as the daughter of an admiral , no mean critic . And sure enough , as punctual as in a well - conducted scheme of war , and with nice forecast of wind and tide , and science of the supper - time , around the westward headland came the bold fleet of Springhaven ! Seven ships of the line the fishing line arranged in perfect order , with the Rosalie as the flag - ship leading , and three upon either quarter , in the comfort and leisure of the new - born peace , they spread their sails with sunshine . Even the warlike Dolly could not help some thoughts of peacefulness , and a gentle tide of large good - will submerged the rocks of glory . "
3279	3335	3104	3104	I	0	" she asked herself , as a new thing , while she made out , by their faces , hats , fling of knee or elbow , patch upon breeches , or sprawl of walking toward the attentive telescope , pretty nearly who everybody of them was , and whatever else there was about him . "

3363	3802	3804	3806	a wonderful man	857	" But these jolly fellows had no idea of losing their lives , or a hair of their heads , or anything more than their appetites , after waging hot war upon victuals . Peace was proclaimed , and peace was reigning ; and the proper British feeling of contempt for snivelly Frenchmen , which produces the entente cordiale , had replaced the wholesome dread of them . Not that Springhaven had ever known fear , but still it was glad to leave off terrifying the enemy . Lightness of heart and good - will prevailed , and every man 's sixpence was going to be a shilling . In the tranquil afternoon the sun was making it clear to the coast of Albion that he had crossed the line once more , and rediscovered a charming island . After a chilly and foggy season , worse than a brave cold winter , there was joy in the greeting the land held out , and in the more versatile expression of the sea . And not beneath the contempt of one who strives to get into everything , were the creases and patches of the sails of smacks , and the pattern of the resin - wood they called their masts , and even the little striped things like frogs with hats on , in the distance which had grown to believe themselves the only object the sun was made to shine upon . But he shone upon the wide sea far behind , and the broad stretch of land before them , and among their slowly gliding canvas scattered soft touches of wandering light . Especially on the spritsail of the Rosalie , whereunder was sitting , with the tiller in his hand and a very long pipe in his mouth , Captain Zebedee Tugwell . His mighty legs were spread at ease , his shoulders solid against a cask , his breast like an elephant 's back in width , and bearing a bright blue crown tattooed shone out of the scarlet woolsey , whose plaits were filled with the golden shower of a curly beard , untouched with gray . And his face was quite as worthy as the substance leading up to it , being large and strengthful and slow to move , though quick to make others do so . The forehead was heavy , and the nose thickset , the lower jaw backed up the resolution of the other , and the wide apart eyes , of a bright steel blue , were as steady as a brace of pole - stars . "

3935	4063	3925	3925	somebody	842	" Being a young and bashful maid , as well as by birth a lady , she had felt that it might be a very nice thing to contemplate sailors in the distance , abstract sailors , old men who pulled ropes , or lounged on the deck , if there was one . But to steal an unsuspected view at a young man very well known to her , and acknowledged not only by his mother and himself , but also by every girl in the parish as the Adonis of Springhaven this was a very different thing , and difficult to justify even to one 's self . The proper plan , therefore , was to do it , instead of waiting to consider it . "
4073	4086	3925	3925	somebody	842	" she whispered to herself , after a good gaze at him , "
4146	4154	4155	4155	Dan	282	" For Zebedee Tugwell had a son called "
4157	4259	4155	4155	Dan	282	" as like him as a tender pea can be like a tough one ; promising also to be tough , in course of time , by chafing of the world and weather . But at present Dan Tugwell was as tender to the core as a marrowfat dallying till its young duck should be ready ; because Dan was podding into his first love . To the sympathetic telescope his heart was low , and his mind gone beyond astronomical range , and his hands instead of briskly pairing soles hung asunder , and sprawled like a star - fish . "

4694	4821	4680	4680	he	278	" whether we have peace or war ; but let us have one or the other of them . I love peace it is a very fine thing and I hate to see poor fellows killed . All I want is to spend the rest of my life ashore , and lay out the garden . You must come and see what a bridge I have made to throw across the fish - pond . I can do well enough with what I have got , as soon as my farm begins to pay , and I hope I may never hear another shotted cannon ; but , my dear Lingo , you know as well as I do how much chance there is of that . "
4822	4964	4965	4966	Admiral Darling	332	" Laudo manentem . Let us praise her while we have got her . Parson Twemlow keeps up my Latin , but you have forgotten all yours , my friend . I brought you down here to see the fish come in , and to choose what you like best for dinner . In the days when you were my smallest youngster , and as proud as Punch to dine with me , your taste was the finest in the ship , because your stomach was the weakest . How often I thought that the fish would eat you ! and but for your wonderful spirit , my friend , that must have happened long ago . But your nature was to fight , and you fought through , as you always do . A drumstick for your praise of peace ! "
5027	5033	5034	5034	he	888	" Here comes the fish ! "
5037	5074	5034	5034	he	888	" Come along , Darling . Never lose a moment that 's my rule . You ca n't get along as fast as I can . I 'll go and settle all the business for you . "
5075	5167	5172	5177	the elder and far heavier Admiral	889	" Why should you be in such a hurry always ? You will never come to my age if you carry on so . You ought to tow a spar astern . Thank God , they do n't know who he is , and I 'll take good care not to let them know . If this is what comes of quick promotion , I am glad that I got on slowly . Well , he may do as he likes for me . He always does that 's one thing . "
5219	5313	5314	5315	The fishermen	896	" Starboard there ! Brail up your gaff ! Is that the way to take the ground ? Ease helm , Rosalie . Smartly , smartly . Have a care , you lubber there . Fenders out ! So , so . Now stand by , all ! There are two smart lads among you , and no more . All the rest are no better than a pack of Crappos . You want six months in a man - of - war 's launch . This is what comes of peace already ! "

5880	5897	5899	5900	Parson Twemlow	285	" I am not a man of the world , but a man of the Word , "
5907	5975	5899	5900	Parson Twemlow	285	" and I shall not feel that I have done my duty unless I stir him up to - morrow . His valor and glory are nothing to me , nor even his value to the country . He does his duty , and I shall do mine . It is useless to talk to me , Maria ; I never shall have such a chance again . "
5976	5985	5987	5988	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" Well , dear , you know best , "
5990	6025	5987	5988	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" and duty is always the highest and best and most sacred consideration . But you surely should remember , for Eliza 's sake , that we never shall dine at the Hall again . "
6026	6068	5899	5900	Parson Twemlow	285	" I do n't care a snap for their dinners , or the chance of Eliza catching some young officer ; and very few come while this peace goes on . I wo n't shirk my duty for any of that . "
6069	6166	5899	5900	Parson Twemlow	285	" Nothing would ever make you shirk your duty , Joshua . And I hope that you know me too well to suppose that I ever would dream of suggesting it . But I do want to see you a Canon , and I know that he begins to have influence in the Church , and therefore the Church is not at all the place to allude to his private affairs in . And , after all , what do we know about them ? It does seem so low to be led away by gossip . "
6167	6170	6172	6173	the Rector	909	" Maria , "
6178	6217	6172	6173	the Rector	909	" I must beg you to leave me to my conscience . I shall not refer to his private affairs . I shall put leading truths in a general way , and let him make the home application . "
6218	6274	5899	5900	Parson Twemlow	285	" Put the cap on if it fits . Very well : you will injure yourself , and do no one any good . Lord Nelson wo n't know it ; he is too simple - minded . But Admiral Darling will never forgive us for insulting him while he is staying at the Hall . "
6275	6310	5899	5900	Parson Twemlow	285	" Maria ! Well , I have long given up all attempts at reasoning with you . If I see a man walking into a furnace , do I insult him by saying beware ? "
6311	6363	6172	6173	the Rector	909	" As I am beyond all reason , Joshua , it is far above me to understand that . But if you escape insulting him , what you do is far worse , and quite unlike a gentleman . You heap a whole pile of insults upon your own brother clergymen . "
6364	6388	5899	5900	Parson Twemlow	285	" I do not at all understand you , Maria : you fly off in such a way from one thing to another ! "
6389	6516	5899	5900	Parson Twemlow	285	" Not at all . Anybody who is not above paying attention must understand me . When he is at Merton he goes to church , and his Rector is bound to look after him . When he is at sea , he has his Chaplain , who preaches whenever the weather permits , and dare not neglect his duties . But the strongest point of all is this his very own father and brother are clergymen , and bound to do their best for him . All these you insult , and in so many words condemn for neglecting their duty , because you are unable to resist the pleasure of a stray shot at a celebrated man when he comes down here for hospitality . "
6517	6531	6533	6536	the Rev. Joshua Twemlow	294	" My dear , you have put the matter in a new light , "
6538	6585	6533	6536	the Rev. Joshua Twemlow	294	" I would be the last man in the world to cast a slur upon any brother clergyman . But it is a sad denial to me , because I had put it so neatly , and a line of Latin at the end of it . "
6586	6636	5899	5900	Parson Twemlow	285	" Never mind , dear . That will do for some one else who deserves it , and has got no influence . And if you could only put instead of it one of your beautifully turned expressions about our debt of gratitude to the noble defender of our country "
6637	6644	6646	6647	her husband	911	" No , no , Maria ! "
6653	6687	6646	6647	her husband	911	" be content without pushing your victory further than Nelson himself would push it . It may be my duty to spare him , but I will not fall down and worship him . "
7156	7193	7150	7151	her father	754	" Let them wait two years ; they are both very young , and may change their minds . If they keep of the same mind for two years , they are welcome to one another . "
7282	7287	7288	7288	he	332	" I tell you , "
7310	7426	7288	7288	he	332	" you will not have seen a finer sight than our fishermen in church I dare say never . Of course they do n't all go . Nobody could expect it . But as many as a reasonable man could desire come there , because they know I like it . Twemlow thinks that they come to please him ; but he finds a mighty difference in his congregation when I and my daughters are out of the parish . But if he goes away , there they are all the same , or perhaps even more , to get a change from him . That will show which of us they care about pleasing . "
7427	7440	7441	7445	the hero of the Nile	948	" And they are quite right . I hate the levelling system , "
7448	7477	7441	7445	the hero of the Nile	948	" A man should go to church to please his landlord , not to please the parson . Is the Chaplain to settle how many come to prayers ? "
7478	7490	7492	7496	the larger - bodied Admiral	949	" That is the right way to look at the thing , "
7498	7576	7492	7496	the larger - bodied Admiral	949	" and I only wish Twemlow could have heard you . I asked him to dine with us yesterday , as you know , because you would have done him so much good ; but he sent some trumpery excuse , although his wife was asked to come with him . She stopped him , no doubt ; to look big , I dare say ; as if they could dine with a Lord Nelson every day ! "
7577	7670	7441	7445	the hero of the Nile	948	" They can do that every day , when they dine with a man who has done his duty . But where is my pretty godchild Dolly ? Horatia seems too long for you . What a long name they gave me ! It may have done very well for my granduncle . But , my dear Lingo , look sharp for your Dolly . She has no mother , nor even a duenna she has turned her off , she said yesterday . Your daughter Faith is an angel , but Dolly "
7671	7704	7492	7496	the larger - bodied Admiral	949	" My Dolly is a little devil , I suppose ! You always found out everything . What have you found my Dolly at ? Perhaps she got it at her baptism . "
7719	7728	7729	7730	Lord Nelson	276	" I am not concerned with your opinion , "
7735	7784	7729	7730	Lord Nelson	276	" But Horatia Dorothy Darling is my godchild by baptism , and you will find her down in my will for a thousand pounds , if she behaves well , and if it should please the Lord to send me some of the prize - money I deserve . "
7882	7890	7891	7891	he	332	" Hurry ; we shall be late , "
7894	8052	7891	7891	he	332	" You remember when we called you ' Hurry , ' because of being always foremost ? But they know better than to stop the bells till they see me in the church porch . Twemlow wanted to upset that , for the parsons want to upset everything . And I said : ' Very well ; then I shall square it by locking the gate from your shrubbery . That will give me five minutes to come down the hill . ' For my grandfather put up that gate , you must know , and of course the key belongs to me . It saves Twemlow a cable's - length every time , and the parsons go to church so often now , he would have to make at least another knot a month . So the bells go on as they used to do . How many bells do you make it , Mr. Nelson ? "
8053	8059	8060	8061	Lord Nelson	276	" Eight bells , sir , "
8571	8582	8583	8583	she	987	" If I could have fetched it to my mind , "
8586	8780	8583	8583	she	987	" that Squire Darling were a tarradiddle , and all his wenches liars which some of them be , and no mistake and if I could refuse my own eyes about gold - lace , and crown jewels , and arms off , happier would I sleep in my bed , ma'am , every night the Lord seeth good for it . I would sooner have found hoppers in the best ham in the shop than have gone to church so to delude myself . But there ! that Cheeseman would make me do it . I did believe as we had somebody fit to do battle for us against Boney , and I laughed about all they invasion and scares . But now why , ' a ca n't say bo to a goose ! If ' a was to come and stand this moment where you be a - standing , and say , ' Mrs. Cheeseman , I want a fine rasher , ' not a bit of gristle would I trim out , nor put it up in paper for him , as I do for you , ma'am . "
8789	8876	8782	8783	Widow Shanks	305	" Never can I tell you what my feelings was , when I seed him a - standing by the monument , ma'am . But I said to myself ' why , my poor John , as is now in heaven , poor fellow , would ' a took you up with one hand , my lord , stars and garters and crowns and all , and put you into his sow - west pocket . ' And so he could have done , Mrs. Cheeseman . "
8897	8906	8907	8907	they	826	" He may not be so very big , "
8910	9037	8907	8907	they	826	" nor so outrageous thunderin ' , as the missus looked out for from what she have read . They always goes by their own opinions , and wrong a score of times out of twenty . But any one with a fork to his leg can see the sort of stuff he is made of . He ' tended his duty in the house of the Lord , and he would n't look after the women ; but he kept his live eye upon every young chap as were fit for a man - of - war's - man Dan Tugwell especial , and young Harry Shanks . You see if he do n't have both of they afore ever the war comes on again ! "
9172	9185	9186	9186	he	276	" What a fine set of fellows you have in your village ! "
9215	9254	9186	9186	he	276	" The finest I have seen on the south coast anywhere . And they look as if they had been under some training . I suppose your father had most of them in the Fencibles , last summer ? "
9255	9261	9262	9262	Faith	297	" Not one of them , "
9272	9343	9262	9262	Faith	297	" They have their own opinions , and nothing will disturb them . Nobody could get them to believe for a moment that there was any danger of invasion . And they carried on all their fishing business almost as calmly as they do now . For that , of course , they may thank you , Lord Nelson ; but they have not the smallest sense of the obligation . "
9344	9435	9186	9186	he	276	" I am used to that , as your father knows ; but more among the noble than the simple . For the best thing I ever did I got no praise , or at any rate very little . As to the Boulogne affair , Springhaven was quite right . There was never much danger of invasion . I only wish the villains would have tried it . Horatia , would you like to see your godfather at work ? I hope not . Young ladies should be peaceful . "
9436	9445	9447	9447	Dolly	277	" Then I am not peaceful at all , "
9458	9461	9186	9186	he	276	" Flapfin , "
9471	9519	9466	9466	Johnny	306	" Why , if there was always peace , what on earth would any but very low people find to do ? There could scarcely be an admiral , or a general , or even a captain , or well , a boy to beat the drums . "
9520	9532	9533	9535	her elder sister	999	" But no drum would want to be beaten , Horatia , "
9548	9559	9536	9536	Faith	297	" and the admirals and the generals would have to be "
9560	9579	9533	9535	her elder sister	999	" Doctors , or clergymen , or something of that sort , or perhaps even worse nasty lawyers . "
9585	9587	9536	9536	Faith	297	" Horatia "
9614	9623	9624	9625	Frank Darling	307	" That last cut was meant for me , "
9642	9737	9624	9625	Frank Darling	307	" Your lordship , though so well known to us , can hardly be expected to know or remember all the little particulars of our race . We are four , as you know ; and the elder two are peaceful , while the younger pair are warlike . And I am to be the ' nasty lawyer , ' called to the bar in the fullness of time which means after dining sufficiently to the great disgust of your little godchild , whose desire from her babyhood has been to get me shot . "
9738	9765	9624	9625	Frank Darling	307	" LITTLE , indeed ! What a word to use about me ! You told a great story . But now you 'll make it true . "
9766	9817	9624	9625	Frank Darling	307	" To wit as we say at Lincoln 's Inn she has not longed always for my death in battle , but henceforth will do so ; but I never shall afford her that gratification . I shall keep out of danger as zealously as your lordship rushes into it . "
9818	9833	9624	9625	Frank Darling	307	" Franky going on , I suppose , with some of his usual nonsense , "
9851	9913	9834	9840	Admiral Darling , who was rather deaf	1004	" Nobody pays much attention to him , because he does not mean a word of it . He belongs to the peace peace peace - at - any - price lot . But when a man wanted to rob him last winter , he knocked him down , and took him by the throat , and very nearly killed him . "
9914	9923	9925	9926	Lord Nelson	276	" That 's the only game to play , "
9939	9962	9925	9926	Lord Nelson	276	" My young friend , you are not such a fool after all . And why should you try to be one ? "
9963	9967	9969	9973	the sweet - tempered Faith	297	" My brother , "
9975	9994	9969	9973	the sweet - tempered Faith	297	" never tries to be a fool , Lord Nelson ; he only tries to be a poet . "
10075	10084	10085	10085	he	276	" Shake hands , my dear young friend , "
10088	10170	10085	10085	he	276	" though I can not offer the right one . I was wrong to call you a fool because you do n't look at things as I do . Poets are almost as good as sailors , and a great deal better than soldiers . I have felt a gift that way myself , and turned out some very tidy lines . But I believe they were mainly about myself , and I never had time to go on with them . "
10207	10211	10213	10215	the young man	861	" My lord , "
10230	10254	10220	10220	he	861	" it is good for the world that you have no right arm , when you disarm it so with your left one . "
10323	10331	10332	10332	he	332	" Here 's a state of things ! "
10341	10385	10332	10332	he	332	" thistles full of seed within a biscuit - heave of my front door , and other things I forget their names with heads like the head of a capstan bursting , all as full of seeds as a purser is of lies ! "
10386	10395	10396	10397	Mr. Swipes	309	" Your lordship do not understand them subjects , "
10410	10440	10396	10397	Mr. Swipes	309	" and small blame to you , in my opinion , after so many years upon the briny wave . Ah ! they ca n't grow them things there . "
10441	10505	10396	10397	Mr. Swipes	309	" Swipes , that is true , but to my mind not at all a satisfactory reason for growing them here , just in front of the house and the windows . I do n't mind a few in the kitchen - garden , but you know as well as I do , Swipes , that they can have no proper business here . "
10506	10519	10396	10397	Mr. Swipes	309	" I did hear tell down to the Club , last night , "
10539	10607	10520	10521	Mr. Swipes	309	" though I do n't pretend to say how far true it may be , that all the land of England is to be cultivated for the public good , same as on the continence , without no propriety or privacy , my lord . But I do n't altogether see how they be to do it . So I thought I 'd better ask your lordship . "
10608	10623	10396	10397	Mr. Swipes	309	" For the public good ! The public - house good , you mean . "
10655	10765	10647	10647	Swipes	309	" How many times more must I tell you , Swipes , that I hate that Jacobin association ? Can you tell me of one seaman belonging to it ? A set of fish - jobbers , and men with barrows , and cheap - jacks from up the country . Not one of my tenants would be such a fool as to go there , even if I allowed him . I make great allowances for you , Swipes , because of your obstinate nature . But do n't let me hear of that Club any more , or YOU may go and cultivate for the public good . "
10766	10833	10835	10836	the master	1020	" Your lordship knows that I goes there for nothing except to keep up my burial . And with all the work there is upon this place , the Lord only knows when I may be requiring of it . Ah ! I never see the like ; I never did . And a blade of grass the wrong way comes down on poor old Swipes ! "
10919	10924	10925	10925	he	309	" My dear soul , "
10958	10967	10925	10925	he	309	" what a day we did have yesterday ! "
10968	10977	10979	10980	Mrs. Cloam	310	" A mercy upon me , Mr. Swipes , "
10989	11014	10979	10980	Mrs. Cloam	310	" how you did exaggerate my poor narves , a - rushing up so soft , with the cold steel in both your hands ! "
11015	11032	11033	11035	the chivalrous Swipes	309	" Ah ! ma'am , it have right to be a good deal wuss than that , "
11046	11083	11033	11035	the chivalrous Swipes	309	" It do n't consarn what the masters say , though enough to take one 's legs off . But the ladies , Mrs. Cloam , the ladies it 's them as takes our heads off . "
11084	11124	10925	10925	he	309	" Go ' long with you , Mr. Swipes ! You are so disastrous at turning things . And how much did he say you was to have this time ? Here 's Jenny Shanks coming up the passage . "
11125	11275	10925	10925	he	309	" Well , he left it to myself ; he have that confidence in me . And little it is I should ever care to take , with the power of my own will , ma'am . Why , the little brown jug , ma'am , is as much as I can manage even of our small beer now . Ah ! I know the time when I would no more have thought of rounding of my mouth for such small stuff than of your growing up , ma'am , to be a young woman with the sponsorship of this big place upon you . Wonderful ! wonderful ! And only yesterday , as a man with a gardening mind looks at it , you was the prettiest young maiden on the green , and the same barring marriage if you was to encounter with the young men now . "
11276	11279	11281	11282	Mrs. Cloam	310	" Oh , "
11292	11372	11281	11282	Mrs. Cloam	310	" how you do make me think of sad troubles , Mr. Swipes ! Jenny , take the yellow jug with the three beef - eaters on it , and go to the third cask from the door the key turns upside down , mind and let me hear you whistle till you bring me back the key . Do n't tell me nonsense about your lips being dry . You can whistle like a blackbird when you choose . "
11373	11537	10925	10925	he	309	" Here 's to your excellent health , Mrs. Cloam , and as blooming as it finds you now , ma'am ! As pretty a tap as I taste since Christmas , and another dash of malt would ' a made it worthy a'most to speak your health in . Well , ma'am , a leetle drop in crystal for yourself , and then for my business , which is to inquire after your poor dear health to - day . Blooming as you are , ma'am , you must bear in mind that beauty is only skin - deep , Mrs. Cloam ; and the purtier a flower is , the more delicate it grows . I 've a - been a - thinking of you every night , ma'am , knowing how you must ' a been put about and driven . The Admiral have gone down to the village , and Miss Dolly to stare at the boats going out . "
11538	11700	11281	11282	Mrs. Cloam	310	" Then I may speak a word for once at ease , Mr. Swipes , though the Lord alone knows what a load is on my tongue . It requires a fine gardener , being used to delicacy , to enter into half the worry we have to put up with . Heroes of the Nile , indeed , and bucklers of the country ! Why , he could not buckle his own shoe , and Jenny Shanks had to do it for him . Not that I blame him for having one arm , and a brave man he is to have lost it , but that he might have said something about the things I got up at a quarter to five every morning to make up for him . For cook is no more than a smoke - jack , Mr. Swipes ; if she keeps the joint turning , that 's as much as she can do . "
11701	11715	11717	11718	Mr. Swipes	309	" And a little too fond of good beer , I 'm afeard , "
11725	11767	11717	11718	Mr. Swipes	309	" Men 's heads was made for it , but not women 's , till they come to superior stations in life . But , oh , Mrs. Cloam , what a life we lead with the crotchets of they gentry ! "
11768	11851	10925	10925	he	309	" It is n't that so much , Mr. Swipes , if only there was any way of giving satisfaction . I wish everybody who is born to it to have the very best of everything , likewise all who have fought up to it . But to make all the things and have nothing made of them , whether indigestion or want of appetite , turns one quite into the Negroes almost , that two or three people go on with . "
11852	11865	11866	11867	Mr. Swipes	309	" I do n't look at what he hath aten or left , "
11873	11965	11866	11867	Mr. Swipes	309	" that lieth between him and his own stommick . But what hath a ' left for me , ma'am ? He hath looked out over the garden when he pleased , and this time of year no weeds is up , and he do n't know enough of things to think nothing of them . When his chaise come down I was out by the gate with a broom in my hand , and I pulled off my hat , but his eye never seemed to lay hold of me . "
11966	12020	10925	10925	he	309	" His eye lays hold of everything , whether he makes 'em feel or no . One thing I 'm sure of he was quite up to Miss Dolly , and the way she carries on with you know who , every blessed Sunday . If that is what they go to church for "
12021	12028	12030	12043	the genial Swipes , whose heart was enlarged with the power of good beer	1023	" But , my dear soul , "
12045	12124	12030	12043	the genial Swipes , whose heart was enlarged with the power of good beer	1023	" when you and I was young folk , what did we go to church for ? I ca n't speak for you , ma'am , being ever so much younger , and a baby in the gallery in long clothes , if born by that time ; but so far as myself goes , it was the girls I went to look at , and most of 'em come as well to have it done to them . "
12125	12275	10925	10925	he	309	" That never was my style , Mr. Swipes , though I know there were some not above it . And amongst equals I wo n't say that there need be much harm in it . But for a young man in the gallery , with a long stick of the vile - base in his hand , and the only clean shirt of the week on his back , and nothing but a plank of pitch to keep him , however good - looking he may be , to be looking at the daughter , and the prettiest one too , though not the best , some people think , of the gentleman that owns all the houses and the haven presumption is the smallest word that I can find to use for it ; and for her to allow it , fat fat something in the nation . "
12276	12281	12283	12284	Mr. Swipes	309	" Well , ma'am , "
12293	12551	12283	12284	Mr. Swipes	309	" it seems a little shock at first to those on trust in families . But Dannel is a brave boy , and might fight his way to glory , and then they has the pick of the femmels up to a thousand pound a year . You know what happened the miller 's son , no further off than Upton . And if it had n't been for Dannel , when she was a little chit , where would proud Miss Dolly be , with her feathers and her furbelows ? Natur ' is the thing I holds by , and I sees a deal of it . And betwixt you and me and the bedpost , ma'am , whoever hath Miss Dolly will have to ride to London on this here scythe . Miss Faith is the lass for a good quiet man , without no airs and graces , and to my judgment every bit as comely , and more of her to hold on by . But the Lord ' a mercy upon us . Mrs. Cloam , you 've a - been married like my poor self ; and you knows what we be , and we knows what you be . Looks ' ai n't much to do with it after the first week or two . It 's the cooking , and the natur ' , and the not going contrairy . B'lieve Miss Dolly would go contrairy to a hangel , if her was j'ined to him three days . "
12552	12557	12558	12559	the housekeeper	1024	" Prejudice ! prejudice ! "
12570	12731	12564	12564	her	1024	" You ought to be above such opinions , Mr. Swipes , a superior man , such as you are . If Miss Faith came into your garden reading books , and finding fault here and there , and sniffing at the flowers , a quarter so often as pretty Dolly does , perhaps you would n't make such a perfect angel of her , and run down her sister in comparison . But your wonderful Miss Faith comes peeping here and poking there into pots and pans , and asking the maids how their mothers are , as if her father kept no housekeeper . She provoked me so in the simple - room last week , as if I was hiding thieves there , that I asked her at last whether she expected to find Mr. Erle there . And you should have seen how she burst out crying ; for something had turned on her mind before . "
12732	12744	12283	12284	Mr. Swipes	309	" Well , I could n't have said that to her , "
12751	12850	12564	12564	her	1024	" not if she had come and routed out every key and every box , pot , pan , and pannier in the tool - house and stoke - hole and vinery ! The pretty dear ! the pretty dear ! And such a lady as she is ! Ah , you women are hard - hearted to one another , when your minds are up ! But take my word for it , Mrs. Cloam , no one will ever have the chance of making your beautiful Miss Dolly cry by asking her where her sweetheart is . "
12858	12869	12871	12872	Admiral Darling	332	" My dear girls , all your courage is gone , "
12883	13010	12871	12872	Admiral Darling	332	" departed perhaps with Lord Nelson and Frank . I hate the new style of such come - and - go visits , as if there was no time for anything . Directly a man knows the ways of the house , and you can take him easily , off he goes . Just like Hurry , he never can stop quiet . He talks as if peace was the joy of his life , and a quiet farm his paradise , and very likely he believes it . But my belief is that a year of peace would kill him , now that he has made himself so famous . When that sort of thing begins , it seems as if it must go on . "
13011	13017	13019	13021	the elder daughter	1028	" But , father dear , "
13023	13106	13019	13021	the elder daughter	1028	" you could have done every single thing that Lord Nelson has ever contrived to do , if you had only happened to be there , and equally eager for destruction . I have heard you say many times , though not of course before him , that you could have managed the battle of the Nile considerably better than he did . And instead of allowing the great vessel to blow up , you would have brought her safe to Spithead . "
13107	13152	12871	12872	Admiral Darling	332	" My dear , you must have quite misunderstood me . Be sure that you never express such opinions , which are entirely your own , in the presence of naval officers . Though I will not say that they are quite without foundation . "
13153	13158	13160	13161	Miss Dolly	277	" Why , papa , "
13176	13195	13160	13161	Miss Dolly	277	" you have often said twice as much as that . How well I remember having heard you say "
13196	13277	12871	12872	Admiral Darling	332	" You young people always back up one another , and you do n't care what you make your poor father say . I wonder you do n't vow that I declared I could jump over the moon with my uniform on . But I 'll tell you what we 'll do , to bring back your senses we will go for a long ride this fine afternoon . I 've a great mind to go as far as Stonnington . "
13278	13299	13160	13161	Miss Dolly	277	" Now how many times have you told us that ? I wo n't believe it till we get there , "
13312	13332	13305	13305	her	318	" You must be ashamed of yourself , papa , for neglecting your old friend 's son so long . "
13333	13348	13350	13354	the good - natured Admiral	1029	" Well , to tell you the truth , I am , my dear , "
13356	13376	13350	13354	the good - natured Admiral	1029	" but no one but myself has the least idea of the quantity of things I have to do . "
13377	13433	12871	12872	Admiral Darling	332	" Exactly what old Swipes said this very morning , only much more impressively . And I really did believe him , till I saw a yellow jug , and a horn that holds a pint , in the summer - house . He threw his coat over them , but it was too late . "
13434	13486	12871	12872	Admiral Darling	332	" Dolly , I shall have to put you in the blackhole . You belong too much to the rising generation , or the upstart generation is the proper word . What would Lord Nelson say ? I must have him back again . He is the man for strict discipline . "
13487	13647	13350	13354	the good - natured Admiral	1029	" Oh , I want to ask one thing about my great godfather . You know he only came down with one portmanteau , and his cocked - hat box , and two hampers . But when I went into his bedroom to see , as a goddaughter should , that his pillow was smooth , there he had got tacked up at the head of his bed a picture of some very beautiful lady , and another at the side , and another at the foot ! And Jenny Shanks , who could n't help peeping in , to see how a great hero goes to sleep , wishes that she may be an old maid forever if she did not see him say his prayers to them . Now the same fate befall me if I do n't find out who it is . You must know , papa , so you had better tell at once . "
13648	13732	12871	12872	Admiral Darling	332	" That hussy shall leave the house tomorrow . I never heard of anything so shameless . Mrs. Cloam seems to have no authority whatever . And you too , Dolly , had no business there . If any one went to see the room comfortable , it should have been Faith , as the lady of the house . Ever since you persuaded me that you were too old for a governess , you seem to be under no discipline at all . "
13733	13758	13760	13760	Dolly	318	" Now you know that you do n't mean that , papa . You say those cruel things just to make me kiss you , "
13789	13810	13780	13781	the father	807	" but I must know who that lady is . And what can he want with three pictures of her ? "
13811	13922	13923	13924	The Admiral	332	" How should I know , Dolly ? Perhaps it is his mother , or perhaps it is the Queen of Naples , who made a Duke of him for what he did out there . Now be quick , both of you , or no ride to - day . It is fifteen long miles to Stonnington , I am sure , and I am not going to break my neck . As it is , we must put dinner off till half past six , and we shall all be starved by that time . Quick , girls , quick ! I can only give you twenty minutes . "
14053	14072	14074	14074	Faith	315	" What a lovely country we have been through ! I should like to come here every day , "
14085	14101	14074	14074	Faith	315	" If Stonnington is as nice as this , Mr. Scudamore must be happy there . "
14102	14109	14110	14111	her father	754	" Well , we shall see , "
14114	14159	14110	14111	her father	754	" My business has been upon the coast so much , that I know very little about Stonnington . But Scudamore has such a happy nature that nothing would come much amiss to him . You know why he is here , of course ? "
14160	14182	14184	14184	Dolly	318	" No , I do n't , papa . You are getting so mysterious that you never tell us anything now , "
14186	14219	14110	14111	her father	754	" I only know that he was in the navy , and now he is in a grammar school . The last time I saw him he was about a yard high . "
14220	14232	14234	14235	the Admiral	747	" He is a good bit short of two yards now , "
14244	14362	14234	14235	the Admiral	747	" but quite tall enough for a sailor , Dolly , and the most active young man I ever saw in my life , every inch of him sound and quick and true . I shall think very little of your judgment unless you like him heartily ; not at first , perhaps , because he is so shy , but as soon as you begin to know him . I mean to ask him to come down as soon as he can get a holiday . His captain told me , when he served in the Diomede , that there was not a man in the ship to come near him for nimbleness and quiet fearlessness . "
14363	14396	14110	14111	her father	754	" Then what made him take to his books again ? Oh , how terribly dull he must find them ! Why , that must be Stonnington church , on the hill ! "
14397	14589	14110	14111	her father	754	" Yes , and the old grammar school close by . I was very near going there once myself , but they sent me to Winchester instead . It was partly through me that he got his berth here , though not much to thank me for , I am afraid . Sixty pounds a year and his rations is n't much for a man who has been at Cambridge . But even that he could not get in the navy when the slack time came last year . He held no commission , like many other fine young fellows , but had entered as a first - class volunteer . And so he had no rating when this vile peace was patched up excuse me , my dear , what I meant to say was , when the blessings of tranquillity were restored . And before that his father , my dear old friend , died very suddenly , as you have heard me say , without leaving more than would bury him . Do n't talk any more of it . It makes me sad to think of it . "
14590	14593	14595	14595	Dolly	318	" But , "
14597	14699	14595	14595	Dolly	318	" I could never understand why a famous man like Sir Edmond Scudamore a physician in large practice , and head doctor to the King , as you have often told us could possibly have died in that sort of way , without leaving any money , or at least a quantity of valuable furniture and jewels . And he had not a number of children , papa , to spend all his money , as I do yours , whenever I get the chance ; though you are growing so dreadfully stingy now that I never can look even decent . "
14700	15000	14110	14111	her father	754	" My dear , it is a very long sad story . Not about my stinginess , I mean though that is a sad story , in another sense , but will not move my compassion . As to Sir Edmond , I can only tell you now that , while he was a man of great scientific knowledge , he knew very little indeed of money matters , and was not only far too generous , but what is a thousand times worse , too trustful . Being of an honorable race himself , and an honorable sample of it , he supposed that a man of good family must be a gentleman ; which is not always the case . He advanced large sums of money , and signed bonds for a gentleman , or rather a man of that rank , whose name does not concern you ; and by that man he was vilely betrayed ; and I would rather not tell you the rest of it . Poor Blyth had to leave Cambridge first , where he was sure to have done very well indeed , and at his wish he was sent afloat , where he would have done even better ; and then , as his father 's troubles deepened , and ended in his death of heart complaint , the poor boy was left to keep his broken - hearted mother upon nothing but a Latin Grammar . And I fear it is like a purser 's dip . But here we are at Stonnington a long steep pitch . Let us slacken sail , my dears , as we have brought no cockswain . Neither of you need land , you know , but I shall go into the schoolroom . "
15001	15009	15011	15015	the active - minded Dolly	1044	" One thing I want to know , "
15028	15059	15011	15015	the active - minded Dolly	1044	" if his father was Sir Edmond , and he is the only child , according to all the laws of nature , he ought to be Sir Blyth Scudamore . "
15060	15093	14110	14111	her father	754	" It shows how little you have been out as good Mrs. Twemlow expresses it that you do not even understand the laws of nature as between a baronet and a knight . "
15094	15151	14110	14111	her father	754	" Oh , to be sure ; I recollect ! How very stupid of me ! The one goes on , and the other does n't , after the individual stops . But whose fault is it that I go out so little ? So you see you are caught in your own trap , papa . "

15944	15999	15935	15936	the hostler	1093	" I declare that I shall be frightened even to look at Mr. Scudamore , if this is a specimen of what he does . There is scarcely a boy looking off his book . But how old he does look ! I suppose it must be the effect of so much hard teaching . "
16000	16005	16006	16007	her sister	6807	" You silly thing , "
16010	16050	16006	16007	her sister	6807	" you are looking at the great head - master . Mr. Scudamore is here at the bottom of the school . Between these big hinges you can see him ; and he looks as young as you do . "
16100	16148	16094	16094	she	277	" He is nothing but a regular frump . I declare I am dreadfully disappointed . No wonder the title did not come on ! He is nothing but a very soft - natured stupe . Why , the boys can do what they like with him ! "

16340	16373	16322	16324	the head boy	1101	" after that , do tell us one of your sea - stories . It will strike five in about five minutes . Something about Nelson , and killing ten great Frenchmen . "
16374	16379	16381	16384	the other little fellows	1102	" Oh , do , "
16390	16403	16381	16384	the other little fellows	1102	" It is ever so much better than Virgil , Captain Scuddy ! "
16404	16447	16322	16324	the head boy	1101	" I am not Captain Scuddy , as I tell you every day . I 'm afraid I am a great deal too good - natured with you . I shall have to send a dozen of you up to be caned . "
16448	16512	16381	16384	the other little fellows	1102	" No , you could n't do that if you tried , Captain Scuddy . But what are you thinking of , all this time ? There are two pretty ladies in riding - habits peeping at you from the bell porch . Why , you have got sweethearts , Captain Scuddy ! What a shame of you never to have told us ! "
16655	16659	16660	16660	he	747	" Dr. Swinks , "
16663	16751	16660	16660	he	747	" I am your very humble servant , Vice - Admiral of the Blue , Charles Darling , and beg a thousand pardons for intrusion on deep learning . But they tell me that your watch is over in some half a minute . Allow me to ask for the son of an old friend , Blyth Scudamore , late of the Diomede frigate , but now of this ancient and learned grammar school . When his labors are over , I would gladly speak with him . "

16773	16789	16758	16761	the head - master	1090	" Sir , my valued young coadjutor is advancing from the fourth form toward you . "
17042	17051	17052	17052	she	315	" How hard you have been at work ! "
17055	17074	17052	17052	she	315	" it makes us seem so lazy ! But we never can find any good thing to do . "
17075	17083	17085	17086	the Admiral	747	" That 's a cut at me , "
17088	17177	17085	17086	the Admiral	747	" Scudamore , when you come to my age , be wiser than to have any daughters . Sure enough , they find no good to do ; and they not only put all the fault of that on me , but they make me the victim of all the mischief they invent . Dolly , my darling , wear that cap if it fits . But you have not shaken hands with Mr. Scudamore yet . I hope you will do so , some hundreds of times . "
17178	17212	17213	17214	Miss Dolly	277	" Not all at once , papa ; or how thankful he would be ! But stop , I have not got half my glove off ; this fur makes them stick so . "
17273	17276	17249	17249	she	277	" Captain Scuddy "
17297	17306	17291	17291	hers	277	" I wonder what you think of me ? "
17322	17337	17316	17316	her	277	" Scudamore , I shall not allow you any time to think about it , "
17352	17527	17338	17339	Admiral Darling	332	" Although you have cut the service for a while , because of our stingy peacefulness , you are sure to come back to us again when England wants English , not Latin and Greek . I am your commanding officer , and my orders are that you come to us from Saturday till Monday . I shall send a boat or at least I mean a buggy to fetch you , as soon as you are off duty , and return you the same way on Monday . Come , girls , ' twill be dark before we are home ; and since the patrols were withdrawn , I hear there 's a highwayman down this road again . That is one of the blessings of peace , Scudamore ; even as Latin and Greek are . ' Apertis otia portis ' Open the gates for laziness . Ah , I should have done well at old Winton , they tell me , if I had not happened to run away to sea . "
18070	18085	18086	18086	Dolly	277	" I shall go down to see them , papa , if you please , "
18096	18178	18086	18086	Dolly	277	" They should have gone on Monday ; but they were too rich ; and I think it very shameful of them . I dare say they have not got a halfpenny left , and that makes them look so lively . Of course they 've been stuffing , and they wo n't move fast , and they ca n't expect any more dinner till they catch it . But they have got so much bacon that they do n't care . "
18179	18192	18194	18201	the Admiral , who had seen hard times	1158	" What could they have better , I should like to know ? "
18203	18254	18194	18201	the Admiral , who had seen hard times	1158	" Why , I gave seven men three dozen apiece for turning their noses up at salt horse , just because he whisked his tail in the copper . Lord bless my soul ! what is the nation coming to , when a man ca n't dine upon cold bacon ? "
18255	18335	18086	18086	Dolly	277	" No , it is not that , papa . They are very good in that way , as their wives will tell you . Jenny Shanks tells me the very same thing , and of course she knows all about them . She knew they would never think of going out on Monday , and if I had asked her I might have known it too . But she says that they are sure to catch this tide . "
18336	18374	18445	18445	her	277	" Very well , Dolly . Go you and catch them . You are never content without seeing something . Though what there is to see in a lot of lubberly craft pushing off with punt - poles "
18375	18404	18194	18201	the Admiral , who had seen hard times	1158	" Hush , papa , hush ! Do n't be so contemptuous . What did my godfather say the other day ? And I suppose he understands things . "
18405	18436	18086	18086	Dolly	277	" Do n't quote your godfather against your father . It was never intended in the Catechism . And if it was , I would never put up with it . "
18789	18796	18797	18798	the Captain	1173	" Toorn o ' the tide ! "
18801	18921	18797	18798	the Captain	1173	" all aboord , aboord , my lads ! The more ' ee bide ashore , the wuss ' ee be . See to Master Cheeseman 's craft ! Got a good hour afront of us . Dannel , what be mooning at ? Fetch ' un a clout on his head , Harry Shanks ; or Tim , you run up and do it . Doubt the young hosebird were struck last moon , and his brains put to salt in a herring - tub . Home with you , wife ! And take Dan , if you will . He 'd do more good at the chipping job , with the full moon in his head so . "
18922	18934	18935	18936	his wife	6501	" Then home I will take my son , Master Tugwell , "
18965	19011	18956	18956	they	1176	" Home I will take my son and yours , and the wisest place for him to abide in , with his father set agin him so . Dannel , you come along of me . I wo n't have my eldest boy gainsaid so . "
19115	19120	19094	19094	he	1180	" No gappermouths here ! "
19127	19151	19094	19094	he	1180	" Get theezell home with the vemmelvolk . Shove off without him , Tim ! How many more tides would ' ee lose ? "
19256	19263	19249	19249	his	337	" Chip of the old block ! "
19264	19272	19249	19249	his	337	" Sarve ' ee right , Cap'en ! "
19273	19283	19294	19294	their	1188	" Starve ' un back to his manners again ! "
19316	19323	19324	19324	he	278	" Spake when I ax you , "
19451	19463	19465	19465	Dolly	335	" How grand he does look ! what a noble profile ! "
19485	19755	19465	19465	Dolly	335	" He is like the centurion in the painted window , or a Roman medallion with a hat on . But that old woman will never catch him . She might just as well go home again . He is walking about ten miles an hour , and how beautifully straight his legs are ! What a shame that he should not be a gentleman ! He is ten times more like one than most of the officers that used to come bothering me so . I wonder how far he means to go ? I do hope he wo n't make away with himself . It is almost enough to make him do it , to be so insulted by his own father , and disgraced before all the village , simply because he ca n't help having his poor head so full of me ! Nobody shall ever say that I did anything to give him the faintest encouragement , because it would be so very wicked and so cruel , considering all he has done for me . But if he comes back , when his father is out of sight , and he has walked off his righteous indignation , and all these people are gone to dinner , it might give a turn to his thoughts if I were to put on my shell - colored frock and the pale blue sash , and just go and see , on the other side of the stepping - stones , how much longer they mean to be with that boat they began so long ago . "
22370	22431	22540	22540	her	1311	" Oh , Captain Tugwell , are you at work still ? Why , you really ought to have gone with the smacks . But perhaps you sent your son instead . I am so glad to see you ! It is such nice company to hear you ! I did not expect to be left alone , like this . "
22432	22468	22540	22540	her	1311	" If you please , miss , it is n't father at all . Father is gone with the fishing long ago . It is only me , Daniel , if you please , miss . "
22469	22497	22540	22540	her	1311	" No , Daniel , I am not pleased at all . I am quite surprised that you should work so late . It scarcely seems respectable . "
22542	22556	22557	22557	he	861	" If you please , Miss Dolly will you please , Miss Dolly ? "
22581	22584	22578	22578	her	1311	" Miss Dolly "
22594	22603	22604	22604	he	861	" You are bound to stop , miss , "
22616	22627	22610	22610	she	1311	" What do you mean by such words to me ? "
22628	22637	22638	22638	he	861	" Not any sort of harm , miss , "
22650	22679	22638	22638	he	861	" and I ask your pardon for speaking so . But if you think twice you are bound to explain what you said concerning me , now just . "
22680	22726	22610	22610	she	1311	" Oh , about your working so late , you mean . I offered good advice to you . I think it is wrong that you should go on , when everybody else has left off long ago . But perhaps your father makes you . "
22727	22734	22741	22741	his	278	" Father is a just man , "
22745	22834	22741	22741	his	278	" now and then he may take a crooked twist , or such like ; but he never goeth out of fair play to his knowledge . He hath a - been hard upon me this day ; but the main of it was to check mother of her ways . You understand , miss , how the women - folk go on in a house , till the other women hear of it . And then out - of - doors they are the same as lambs . "
22835	22879	22741	22741	his	278	" It is most ungrateful and traitorous of you to your own mother to talk so . Your mother spoils you , and this is all the thanks she gets ! Wait till you have a wife of your own , Master Daniel ! "
22880	22893	22894	22894	he	1312	" Wait till I am dead then I may , Miss Dolly , "
22916	22922	22911	22911	he	1312	" I beg your pardon , "
22932	22973	22911	22911	he	1312	" but let me see you safe to your own gate ; there are very rough people about here now , and the times are not quite as they used to be , when we were a - fighting daily . "
22992	22999	23000	23002	the young lady	1315	" Good - night , Daniel , "
23023	23068	23000	23002	the young lady	1315	" I am very much obliged to you , and I do hope I have not said anything to vex you . I have never forgotten all you did for me , and you must not mind the way I have of saying things . "
23069	23083	23084	23084	she	1315	" What a shame it does appear what a fearful shame it is , "
23094	23129	23084	23084	she	1315	" that he should be nothing but a fisherman ! He is a gentleman in everything but birth and education ; and so strong , and so brave , and so good - looking ! "
23134	23152	23000	23002	the young lady	1315	" Do it again now , Captain Scuddy ; do it again ; you know you must . "
23153	23176	23000	23002	the young lady	1315	" You touched the rim with your shoe , last time . You are bound to do it clean , once more . "
23177	23198	23000	23002	the young lady	1315	" No , he did n't . You are a liar ; it was only the ribbon of his shoe . "
23199	23222	23000	23002	the young lady	1315	" I 'll punch your head if you say that again . It was his heel , and here 's the mark . "
23223	23263	23000	23002	the young lady	1315	" Oh , Scuddy dear , do n't notice them . You can do it fifty times running , if you like . Nobody can run or jump like you . Do it just once more to please me . "
23293	23304	23314	23314	he	429	" Very well , then ; once more for Kitty , "
23321	23372	23314	23314	he	429	" But you know that I always leave off at a dozen . Thirteen thirteen I could never stop at . I shall have to do fourteen at least ; and it is too bad , just after dinner . Now all of you watch whether I touch it anywhere . "
23478	23483	23484	23484	he	429	" Come , now , "
23497	23528	23484	23484	he	429	" one of you big fellows come and do it . You are three inches taller than I am . And you have only got to make up your minds . "
23561	23573	23575	23575	Blyth	429	" Well , then , I must do it once more , "
23577	23603	23575	23575	Blyth	429	" for I dare not leave off at thirteen , for fear of some great calamity , such as I never could jump out of . "
23730	23750	23703	23704	the boys	6929	" One more jump , Captain Scuddy ! You must ; to show the flunky what you can do . "
23751	23778	23703	23704	the boys	6929	" Oh , do n't I wish I was going ? He 'll have turtle soup , and venison , and two men behind his chair . "
23779	23795	23703	23704	the boys	6929	" And the beautiful young ladies looking at him every time he takes a mouthful . "
23796	23827	23703	23704	the boys	6929	" But he dare not go courting after thirteen jumps . And he has vowed that he will have another . Come , Captain Scuddy , no time to lose . "
23867	23899	23703	23704	the boys	6929	" If you please , sir , his honour the Hadmiral have sent me to fetch ' e and your things ; and hoss be baiting along of the Blue Dragon . "
23900	23932	23703	23704	the boys	6929	" I am sorry to say that I forgot all about it , or , at least , I thought that he would . How long before we ought to start ? "
23933	24007	23703	23704	the boys	6929	" My name is Gregory , sir Coachman Gregory accustomed always to a pair , but does n't mind a single hoss , to oblige the Hadmiral , once in a way . About half an hour , sir , will suit me , unless they comes down to the skittle - alley , as ought to be always on a Saturday afternoon ; but not a soul there when I looked in . "
24080	24090	24091	24091	he	429	" If I wear the best I have got , "
24094	24122	24091	24091	he	429	" I can not be charged with disrespect . The Admiral knows what a sailor is ; and , after all , who will look at me ? "
24220	24245	24247	24248	the Admiral	747	" Your father was my dearest friend , and the very best man I ever knew . I must call you ' Blyth , ' "
24250	24268	24247	24248	the Admiral	747	" for if I call you ' Scudamore , ' I shall think perpetually of my loss . "
24447	24458	24459	24459	she	297	" What a plague he will be all day tomorrow ! "
24470	24554	24459	24459	she	297	" Father was obliged , I suppose , to invite him ; but what can we do with him all the day ? Sundays are dull enough , I am sure , already , without our having to amuse a gentleman who has scarcely got two ideas of his own , and is afraid to say ' bo ' to a goose , I do believe . Did you hear what he said when I asked him whether he was fond of riding ? "
24555	24594	24459	24459	she	297	" Yes ; and I thought it so good of him , to answer so straightforwardly . He said that he used to be very fond of it , but was afraid that he should fall off now . "
24595	24661	24673	24673	his	429	" I should like to see him . I tell you what we 'll do . We will make him ride back on Monday morning , and put him on ' Blue Bangles , ' who wo n't have seen daylight since Friday . Wo n't he jump about a bit ! What a shame it is , not to let us ride on Sundays ! "
24769	24776	24778	24779	Admiral Darling	332	" Just in time , Rector , "
24793	24819	24778	24779	Admiral Darling	332	" This is my young friend Blyth Scudamore , the son of one of my oldest friends . You have heard of Sir Edmond Scudamore ? "
24820	24869	24870	24872	The old man	1354	" And seen him and felt him . And to him I owe , under a merciful Providence , the power of drinking in this fine port the health of his son , which I do with deep pleasure , for the excellence both of end and means . "
24922	25022	25037	25037	his	429	" The question we have in hand is this . What is to be done with our friend Blyth ? He was getting on famously , till this vile peace came . Twemlow , you called it that yourself , so that argument about words is useless . Blyth 's lieutenancy was on the books , and the way they carry things on now , and shoot poor fellows ' heads off , he might have been a post - captain in a twelvemonth . And now there seems nothing on earth before him better than Holy - Orders . "
25023	25032	25034	25034	Scudamore	429	" Admiral Darling is kind enough to think , "
25050	25061	25037	25037	his	429	" that I am too good to be a clergyman . "
25062	25106	25037	25037	his	429	" And so you are , and Heaven knows it , Blyth , unless there was a chance of getting on by goodness , which there is in the Navy , but not in the Church . Twemlow , what is your opinion ? "
25107	25116	25118	25119	the Rector	909	" It would not be modest in me , "
25121	25144	25118	25119	the Rector	909	" to stand up too much for my own order . We do our duty , and we do n't get on . "
25145	25194	25037	25037	his	429	" Exactly . You could not have put it better . You get no vacancies by shot and shell , and being fit for another world , you keep out of it . Have you ever heard me tell the story about Gunner MacCrab , of the Bellerophon ? "
25195	25204	25206	25208	the sturdy parson	1360	" Fifty times , and more than that , "
25233	25301	25206	25208	the sturdy parson	1360	" But now about our young friend here . Surely , with all that we know by this time of the character of that Bony , we can see that this peace is a mere trick of his to bamboozle us while he gets ready . In six months we shall be at war again , hammer and tongs , as sure as my name is Twemlow . "
25302	25307	25309	25310	the Admiral	747	" So be it ! "
25329	25409	25321	25321	Scudamore	429	" if it is the will of God , so be it . But if it once begins again , God alone knows where France will be before you and I are in our graves . They have drained all our patience , and our pockets very nearly ; but they have scarcely put a tap into our energy and endurance . But what are they ? A gang of slaves , rammed into the cannon by a Despot . "
25410	25458	25206	25208	the sturdy parson	1360	" They seem to like it , and the question is for them . But the struggle will be desperate , mountains of carnage , oceans of blood , universal mourning , lamentation , and woe . And I have had enough trouble with my tithes already . "
25459	25470	25472	25473	the Admiral	747	" Tithes are dependent on the will of the Almighty , "
25483	25597	25472	25473	the Admiral	747	" but a war goes by reason and good management . It encourages the best men of the day , and it brings out the difference between right and wrong , which are quite smothered up in peace time . It keeps out a quantity of foreign rubbish and stuff only made to be looked at , and it makes people trust one another , and know what country they belong to , and feel how much they have left to be thankful for . And what is the use of a noble fleet , unless it can get some fighting ? Blyth , what say you ? You know something about that . "
25598	25640	25206	25208	the sturdy parson	1360	" No , sir , I have never been at close quarters yet . And I doubt or at least I am certain that I should not like it . I am afraid that I should want to run down below . "
25674	25684	25686	25687	Admiral Darling	332	" Of all I have ever known or met , "
25691	25823	25686	25687	Admiral Darling	332	" there are but three Nelson and two others , and one of those two was half - witted who could fetch up muzzle to muzzle without a feeling of that sort . The true courage lies in resisting the impulse , more than being free from it . I know that I was in a precious fright the first time I was shot at , even at a decent distance ; and I do n't pretend to like it even now . But I am pretty safe now from any further chance , I fear . When we cut our wisdom - teeth , they shelf us . Twemlow , how much wiser you are in the Church ! The older a man gets , the higher they promote him . "
25824	25832	25833	25834	the Rector	909	" Then let them begin with me , "
25839	25909	25833	25834	the Rector	909	" I am old enough now for almost anything , and the only promotion I get is stiff joints , and teeth that crave peace from an olive . Placitam paci , Mr. Scudamore knows the rest , being fresh from the learned Stonnington . But , Squire , you know that I am content . I love Springhaven , Springhaven loves me , and we chasten one another . "
25910	26054	25686	25687	Admiral Darling	332	" A man who knows all the Latin you know , Rector for I own that you beat me to the spelling - book should be at least an Archdeacon in the Church , which is equal to the rank of Rear - Admiral . But you never have pushed as you should do ; and you let it all off in quotations . Those are very comforting to the mind , but I never knew a man do good with them , unless they come out of the Bible . When Gunner Matthew of the Erigdoupos was waiting to have his leg off , with no prospect before him except a better world you know what our Chaplain said to him ; and the effect upon his mind was such , that I have got him to this day upon my land . "
26055	26112	25833	25834	the Rector	909	" Of course you have the biggest old poacher in the county . He shoots half your pheasants with his wooden leg by moonlight . What your Chaplain said to him was entirely profane in the turn of a text of Holy - Writ ; and it shows how our cloth is spoiled by contact with yours "
26142	26195	25686	25687	Admiral Darling	332	" and I hope it will be a good warning to you , Squire , to settle no more old gunners on your property . You must understand , Mr. Scudamore , that the Admiral makes a sort of Naval Hospital , for all his old salts , on his own Estates . "
26196	26207	26208	26210	the young man	861	" I am sure it is wonderfully kind in him , "
26215	26255	26208	26210	the young man	861	" for the poor old fellows are thrown to the dogs by the country , when it has disabled them . I have not seen much of the service , but quite enough to know that , Mr. Twemlow . "
26256	26436	25686	25687	Admiral Darling	332	" I have seen a great deal , and I say that it is so . And my good friend knows it as well as I do , and is one of the first to lend a helping hand . In all such cases he does more than I do , whenever they come within his knowledge . But let us return to the matter in hand . Here is a young man , a first - rate sailor , who would have been under my guardianship , I know , but for but for sad circumstances . Is he to be grinding at Virgil and Ovid till all his spirit goes out of him , because we have patched up a very shabby peace ? It can never last long . Every Englishman hates it , although it may seem to save his pocket . Twemlow , I am no politician . You read the papers more than I do . How much longer will this wretched compact hold ? You have predicted the course of things before . "
26437	26444	26446	26447	the Rector	909	" And so I will again , "
26449	26539	26446	26447	the Rector	909	" Atheism , mockery , cynicism , blasphemy , lust , and blood - thirstyness can not rage and raven within a few leagues of a godly and just nation without stinking in their nostrils . Sir , it is our mission from the Lord to quench Bony , and to conquer the bullies of Europe . We do n't look like doing it now , I confess . But do it we shall , in the end , as sure as the name of our country is England . "
26540	26548	26550	26551	the Admiral	747	" I have no doubt of it , "
26555	26589	26550	26551	the Admiral	747	" but there will be a deal of fighting betwixt this and then . Blyth , will you leave me to see what I can do , whenever we get to work again ? "
26590	26623	26446	26447	the Rector	909	" I should think that I would , sir , and never forget it . I am not fond of fighting ; but how I have longed to feel myself afloat again ! "
27053	27066	27067	27068	Captain Tugwell	278	" Now do n't let none of us be in no hurry , "
27081	27231	27067	27068	Captain Tugwell	278	" a man knoweth his own trade the best , the very same way as the parson doth . And I never knew no good to come of any hurry . Our lives are given us by the Lord . And He never would ' a made 'em threescore and ten , or for men of any strength fourscore , if His will had been to jerk us over them . Never did I see no Frenchman as could be turned to an Englishman , not if he was to fast and pray all day , and cut himself with knives at the going down of the sun . My opinion is that Parson Twemlow were touched up by his own conscience for having a nephew more French than English ; and ' Caryl Carne ' is the name thereof , with more French than English sound to it . "
27232	27244	27246	27251	the landlord of the Darling Arms	1391	" Why , he have been gone for years and years , "
27260	27282	27246	27251	the landlord of the Darling Arms	1391	" he have never been seen in these parts since the death of the last Squire Carne , to my knowledge . "
27283	27447	27067	27068	Captain Tugwell	278	" And what did the old Squire die of , John Prater ? Not that he were to be called old younger , I dare say , than I be now . What did he die of , but marrying with a long outlandish ' ooman ? A femmel as could n't speak a word of English , to be anyhow sure of her meaning ! Ah , them was bad times at Carne Castle ; and as nice a place as need be then , until they dipped the property . Six grey horses they were used to go with to London Parliament every year , before the last Squire come of age , as I have heered my father say scores of times , and no lie ever come from his mouth , no more than it could from mine , almost . Then they dropped to four , and then to two , and pretended that the roads were easier . "
27448	27464	27466	27472	a stout young man in the corner	1394	" When I was down the coast , last week , so far as Littlehampton , "
27474	27680	27466	27472	a stout young man in the corner	1394	" a very coorous thing happened me , leastways by my own opinion , and glad shall I be to have the judgment of Cappen Zeb consarning it . There come in there a queer - rigged craft of some sixty ton from Halvers , desiring to set up trade again , or to do some smoogling , or spying perhaps . Her name was the Doctor Humm , which seem a great favorite with they Crappos , and her skipper had a queer name too , as if he was two men in one , for he called himself ' Jacks ' ; a fellow about forty year old , as I hauled out of the sea with a boat - hook one night on the Varners . Well , he seemed to think a good deal of that , though contrary to their nature , and nothing would do but I must go to be fated with him everywhere , if the folk would change his money . He had picked up a decent bit of talk from shipping in the oyster line before the war ; and I put his lingo into order for him , for which he was very thankful . "
27681	27702	27067	27068	Captain Tugwell	278	" And so he was bound to be . But you had no call to do it , Charley Bowles . "
27735	27978	27722	27722	their	1284	" Well , main likely , I went amiss . But he seemed to take it so uncommon kind of me hitching him with a boat - hook , that we got on together wonderful , and he called me ' Friar Sharley , ' and he tried to take up with our manners and customs ; but his head was outlandish for English grog . One night he was three sheets in the wind , at a snug little crib by the river , and he took to the brag as is born with them . ' All dis contray in one year now , ' says he , nodding over his glass at me , ' shall be of the grand nashong , and I will make a great man of you , Friar Sharley . Do you know what prawns are , my good friend ? ' Well , I said I had caught a good many in my time ; but he laughed and said , ' Prawns will catch you this time . One tousand prawns , all with two hondred men inside him , and the leetle prawns will come to land at your house , Sharley . Bootiful place , quiet sea , no bad rocks . You look out in the morning , and the white coast is made black with them . ' Now what do you say to that , Cappen Tugwell ? "
27979	27993	27714	27714	he	861	" I 've a - heered that style of talk many times afore , "
28000	28036	27994	27995	Master Tugwell	288	" and all I can say is that I should have punched his head . And you deserve the same thing , Charley Bowles , unless you 've got more than that to tell us . "
28037	28103	27722	27722	their	1284	" So I might , Cappen , and I wo n't deny you there . But the discourse were consarning Squire Carne now just , and the troubles he fell into , before I was come to my judgment yet . Why , an uncle of mine served footman there Jeremiah Bowles , known to every one , until he was no more heard of . "
28129	28336	27994	27995	Master Tugwell	288	" Yes , it were a coorous thing indeed , and coorous for me to hear of it , out of all mast - head of Springhaven . Says Moosoo Jacks to me , that night when I boused him up unpretending : ' You keep your feather eye open , my tear , ' for such was his way of pronouncing it , ' and you shall arrive to laglore , laglore and what is still nobler , de monnay . In one two tree month , you shall see a young captain returned to his contray dominion , and then you will go to his side and say Jacks , and he will make present to you a sack of silver . ' Well , I hailed the chance of this pretty smart , you may suppose , and I asked him what the sailor 's name would be , and surprised I was when he answered Carne , or Carny , for he gave it in two syllables . Next morning 's tide , the Doctor Humm cleared out , and I had no other chance of discourse with Moosoo Jacks . But I want to know what you think , Cappen Zeb . "
28337	28342	28344	28347	the captain of Springhaven	1398	" So you shall , "
28351	28492	28344	28347	the captain of Springhaven	1398	" I think you had better call your Moosoo Jacks ' Master Jackass , ' or ' Master Jackanapes , ' and put your own name on the back of him . You been with a Frenchman hob and nobbing , and you do n't even know how they pronounce themselves , unchristian as it is to do so . ' Jarks ' were his name , the very same as Navy beef , and a common one in that country . But to speak of any Carne coming nigh us with French plottings , and of prawns landing here at Springhaven ' tis as likely as I should drop French money into the till of this baccy - box . And you can see that I be not going to play such a trick as that , John Prater . "
28493	28505	28506	28507	the landlord	1399	" Why to my mind there never was bigger stuff talked , "
28528	28596	28506	28507	the landlord	1399	" than to carry on in that way , Charley . What they may do at Littlehampton is beyond my knowledge , never having kept a snug crib there , as you was pleased to call it . But at Springhaven ' twould be the wrong place for hatching of French treacheries . We all know one another a deal too well for that , I hope . "
28597	28604	28606	28607	Mr. Cheeseman	301	" Prater , you are right , "
28622	28769	28606	28607	Mr. Cheeseman	301	" Bowles , you must have an imagination the same as your uncle Jerry had . And to speak of the Carnes in a light way of talking , after all their misfortunes , is terrible . Why , I passed the old castle one night last week , with the moon to one side of it , and only me in my one - horse shay to the other , and none but a man with a first - rate conscience would have had the stomach to do so . However , I seed no ghosts that time , though I did hear some noises as made me use the whip ; and the swing of the ivy was black as a hearse . A little drop more of my own rum , John : it gives me quite a chill to think of it . "
28770	28782	28783	28784	Harry Shanks	1402	" I do n't take much account of what people say , "
28795	28992	28783	28784	Harry Shanks	1402	" without it is in my own family . But my own cousin Bob was coming home one night from a bit of sweethearting at Pebbleridge , when , to save the risk of rabbit - holes in the dark , for he put out his knee - cap one time , what does he do but take the path inland through the wood below Carne Castle the opposite side to where you was , Master Cheeseman , and the same side as the moon would be , only she was n't up that night . Well , he had some misgivings , as anybody must ; still he pushed along , whistling and swinging his stick , and saying to himself that there was no such thing as cowardice in our family ; till just at the corner where the big yew - tree is , that we sometimes starboard helm by when the tide is making with a nor'west wind ; there Bob seed a sight as made his hair crawl . But I wo n't say another word about it now , and have to go home in the dark by myself arter'ards . "
28993	29000	28783	28784	Harry Shanks	1402	" Come , now , Harry ! "
29001	29010	28783	28784	Harry Shanks	1402	" Oh , we ca n't stand that ! "
29011	29032	28783	28784	Harry Shanks	1402	" We 'll see you to your door , lad , if you out with it , fair and forcible . "
29060	29069	28783	28784	Harry Shanks	1402	" Harry Shanks , you will have the manners "
29100	29167	29082	29082	he	278	" to finish the story which you began . To begin a yarn of your own accord , and then drop it all of a heap , is not respectful to present company . Springhaven never did allow such tricks , and will not put up with them from any young fellow . If your meaning was to drop it , you should never have begun . "
29204	29433	29201	29202	the public	1405	" Well , then , all of you know where the big yew - tree stands , at the break of the hill about half a mile inland , and how black it looms among the other stuff . But Bob , with his sweetheart in his head , no doubt , was that full of courage that he forgot all about the old tree , and the murder done inside it a hundred and twenty years ago , they say , until there it was , over his head a'most , with the gaps in it staring like ribs at him . ' Bout ship was the word , pretty sharp , you may be sure , when he come to his wits consarning it , and the purse of his lips , as was whistling a jig , went as dry as a bag with the bottom out . Through the grey of the night there was sounds coming to him , such as had no right to be in the air , and a sort of a shiver laid hold of his heart , like a cold hand flung over his shoulder . As hard as he could lay foot to the ground , away he went down hill , forgetting of his kneecap , for such was the condition of his mind and body . "
29612	29809	29592	29592	he	1408	" From the black of the yew - tree there burst a big light , brighter than a lighthouse or a blue thunder - bolt , and flying with a long streak down the hollow , just as if all the world was a - blazing . Three times it come , with three different colours , first blue , and then white , and then red as new blood ; and poor Bob was in a condition of mind must be seen before saying more of it . If he had been brought up to follow the sea , instead of the shoemaking , maybe his wits would have been more about him , and the narves of his symptom more ship - shape . But it never was borne into his mind whatever , to keep a lookout upon the offing , nor even to lie snug in the ferns and watch the yew - tree . All he was up for was to make all sail , the moment his sticks would carry it ; and he feared to go nigh his sweetheart any more , till she took up with another fellow . "
29810	29817	29592	29592	he	1408	" And sarve him quite right , "
29834	29858	29592	29592	he	1408	" to be skeered of his life by a smuggler 's signal ! Eh , Cappen Zebedee , you know that were it ? "
30059	30065	30039	30040	Mr. Twemlow	299	" Carne non caret carne . "
30195	30201	30203	30204	Mr. Twemlow	299	" Poor as I am , "
30211	30244	30203	30204	Mr. Twemlow	299	" and poor as every beneficed clergyman must be , if this war returns , I would rather have lost a hundred pounds than have heard what you tell me , Maria . "
30245	30256	30257	30258	his wife	6501	" My dear , I can not quite see that , "
30263	30298	30257	30258	his wife	6501	" if he only had money to keep up the place , and clear off those nasty incumbrances , I should rejoice at his coming back to live where we have been for centuries . "
30299	30476	30203	30204	Mr. Twemlow	299	" My dear , you are too poetical , though the feeling is a fine one . Within the old walls there can scarcely be a room that has a sound floor to it . And as for the roof , when that thunder - storm was , and I took shelter with my pony well , you know the state I came home in , and all my best clothes on for the Visitation . Luckily there seems to be no rheumatism in your family , Maria ; and perhaps he is too young as yet to pay out for it till he gets older . But if he comes for business , and to see to the relics of his property , surely he might have a bedroom here , and come and go at his liking . After all his foreign fanglements , a course of quiet English life and the tone of English principles might be of the greatest use to him . He would never wish to see the Continent again . "
30477	30486	30488	30489	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" It is not to be thought of , "
30491	30683	30488	30489	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" I would not have him to live in this house for fifty thousand pounds a year . You are a great deal wiser than I am , Joshua ; but of his nature you know nothing , whereas I know it from his childhood . And Eliza is so strong - willed and stubborn you dislike , of course , to hear me say it , but it is the fact it is , my dear . And I would rather stand by our daughter 's grave than see her fall in love with Caryl Carne . You know what a handsome young man he must be now , and full of French style and frippery . I am sure it is most kind of you to desire to help my poor family ; but you would rue the day , my dear , that brought him beneath our quiet roof . I have lost my only son , as it seems , by the will of the Lord , who afflicts us . But I will not lose my only daughter , by any such folly of my own . "
30720	30729	30730	30730	he	911	" It shall be exactly as you like , "
30738	30782	30730	30730	he	911	" You say that no answer is needed ; and there is no address to send one to . We shall hear of it , of course , when he takes possession , if , indeed , he is allowed to do so . "
30783	30847	30692	30692	she	292	" Who is to prevent him from coming , if he chooses , to live in the home of his ancestors ? The estates are all mortgaged , and the park is gone , turned into a pound for Scotch cattle - breeding . But the poor old castle belongs to us still , because no one would take the expense of it . "
30848	30901	30700	30701	her husband	911	" And because of the stories concerning it , Maria . Your nephew Caryl is a brave young fellow if he means to live there all alone , and I fear he can afford himself no company . You understand him so much better : what do you suppose his motive is ? "
30902	31052	30730	30730	he	911	" I make no pretence to understand him , dear , any more than his poor father could . My dear brother was of headstrong order , and it did him no good to contradict him , and indeed it was dangerous to do so ; but his nature was as simple as a child 's almost , to any one accustomed to him . If he had not married that grand French lady , who revelled in every extravagance , though she knew how we all were impoverished , he might have been living and in high position now , though a good many years my senior . And the worst of it was that he did it at a time when he ought to have known so much better . However , he paid for it bitterly enough , and his only child was set against him . "
31053	31060	31062	31063	the rector	909	" A very sad case altogether , "
31065	31144	31062	31063	the rector	909	" I remember , as if it were yesterday , how angry poor Montagu was with me . You remember what words he used , and his threat of attacking me with his horsewhip . But he begged my pardon , most humbly , as soon as he saw how thoroughly right I was . You are like him in some things , as I often notice , but not quite so generous in confessing you were wrong . "
31145	31200	30730	30730	he	911	" Because I do n't do it as he did , Joshua . You would never understand me if I did . But of course for a man you can make allowance . My rule is to do it both for men and women , quite as fairly as if one was the other . "
31201	31245	30730	30730	he	911	" Certainly , Maria certainly . And therefore you can do it , and have always done it , even for poor Josephine . No doubt there is much to be pleaded , by a candid and gentle mind , on her behalf . "
31246	31303	31062	31063	the rector	909	" What ! that dreadful creature who ruined my poor brother , and called herself the Countess de Lune , or some such nonsense ! No , Joshua , no ! I have not so entirely lost all English principle as to quite do that . Instead of being largeness , that would be mere looseness . "
31304	31325	31326	31327	Mr. Twemlow	299	" There are many things , however , that we never understood , and perhaps never shall in this world , "
31347	31436	31334	31334	himself	299	" and nothing is more natural than that young Caryl should side with his mother , who so petted him , against his poor father , who was violent and harsh , especially when he had to pay such bills . But perhaps our good nephew has amassed some cash , though there seems to be but little on the Continent , after all this devastation . Is there anything , Maria , in his letter to enable us to hope that he is coming home with money ? "
31437	31446	31447	31448	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" Not a word , I am afraid , "
31453	31545	31447	31448	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" But take it , my dear , and read it to me slowly . You make things so plain , because of practice every Sunday . Oh , Joshua , I never can be sure which you are greatest in the Lessons or the Sermon . But before you begin I will shoot the bolt a little , as if it had caught by accident . Eliza does rush in upon us sometimes in the most unbecoming , unladylike way . And I never can get you to reprove her . "
31546	31673	31674	31675	The rector	909	" It would be as much as my place is worth , as the maids say when imagined to have stolen sugar . And I must not read this letter so loud as the Lessons , unless you wish Lizzie to hear every word , for she has all her mother 's quick senses . There is not much of it , and the scrawl seems hasty . We might have had more for three and fourpence . But I am not the one to grumble about bad measure as the boy said about old Busby . Now , Maria , listen , but say nothing ; if feminine capacity may compass it . Why , bless my heart , every word of it is French ! "
31695	31733	31689	31689	she	6501	" What else could you expect , after all his years abroad ? I can not make out the whole of it , for certain . But surely it is not beyond the compass of masculine capacity . "
31734	31802	31447	31448	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" Yes , it is , Maria ; and you know it well enough . No honest Englishman can endure a word of French . Latin , or Greek , or even Hebrew though I took to that rather late in life . But French is only fit for women , and very few of them can manage it . Let us hear what this Frenchman says . "
31803	32031	31447	31448	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" He is not a Frenchman , Joshua . He is an Englishman , and probably a very fine one . I wo n't be sure about all of his letter , because it is so long since I was at school ; and French books are generally unfit to read . But the general meaning is something like this : ' MY BELOVED AND HIGHLY VALUED AUNT , Since I heard from you there are many years now , but I hope you have held me in memory . I have the intention of returning to the country of England , even in this bad time of winter , when the climate is most funereal . I shall do my best to call back , if possible , the scattered ruins of the property , and to institute again the name which my father made displeasing . In this good work you will , I have faith , afford me your best assistance , and the influence of your high connection in the neighbourhood . Accept , dear aunt , the assurance of my highest consideration , of the most sincere and the most devoted , and allow me the honour of writing myself your most loving and respectful nephew , ' CARYL CARNE . ' Now , Joshua , what do you think of that ? "
32032	32216	31447	31448	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" Fine words and no substance ; like all French stuff . And he never even mentions me , who gave him a top , when he should have had the whip . I will not pretend to understand him , for he always was beyond me . Dark and excitable , moody and capricious , haughty and sarcastic , and devoid of love for animals . You remember his pony , and what he did to it , and the little dog that crawled upon her stomach towards him . For your sake I would have put up with him , my dear , and striven to improve his nature , which is sure to be much worse at six - and - twenty , after so many years abroad . But I confess it is a great relief to me that you wisely prefer not to have him in this house , any more at least than we can help it . But who comes here ? What a hurry we are in ! Lizzie , my darling , be patient . "
32217	32265	31447	31448	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" Here 's this plague of a door barred and bolted again ! Am I not to have an atom of breakfast , because I just happened to oversleep myself ? The mornings get darker and darker ; it is almost impossible to see to dress oneself . "
32266	32285	31447	31448	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" There is plenty of tinder in the house , Eliza , and plenty of good tallow candles , "
32304	32374	32300	32301	the complainant	1433	" For the third time this week we have had prayers without you , and the example is shocking for the servants . We shall have to establish the rule you suggest too late to pray for food , too late to get it . But I have kept your help of bacon hot , quite hot , by the fire . And the teapot is under the cozy . "
32375	32382	32383	32385	the young lady	1315	" Thank you , dear mother , "
32407	32427	32383	32385	the young lady	1315	" I suppose there is no kind of news this morning to reward one for getting up so early . "
32428	32437	32445	32445	he	754	" Nothing whatever for you , Miss Lizzie , "
32450	32489	32445	32445	he	754	" But the paper is full of the prospects of war , and the extent of the preparations . If we are driven to fight again , we shall do it in earnest , and not spare ourselves . "
32490	32552	32383	32385	the young lady	1315	" Nor our enemies either , I do hope with all my heart . How long are we to be afraid of them ? We have always invaded the French till now . And for them to talk of invading us ! There is not a bit of spirit left in this island , except in the heart of Lord Nelson . "
32553	32563	32565	32566	the father	807	" What a hot little patriot this child is ! "
32575	32609	32565	32566	the father	807	" What would she say to an Englishman , who was more French than English , and would only write French letters ? And yet it might be possible to find such people . "
32610	32617	32619	32620	Miss Twemlow	380	" If such a wretch existed , "
32622	32660	32619	32620	Miss Twemlow	380	" I should like to crunch him as I crunch this toast . For a Frenchman I can make all fair allowance , because he can not help his birth . But for an Englishman to turn Frenchman "
32661	32671	32672	32674	the candid rector	1437	" However reluctant we may be to allow it , "
32677	32775	32672	32674	the candid rector	1437	" they are the foremost nation in the world , just now , for energy , valour , decision , discipline , and I fear I must add patriotism . The most wonderful man who has appeared in the world for centuries is their leader , and by land his success has been almost unbroken . If we must have war again , as I fear we must , and very speedily , our chief hope must be that the Lord will support His cause against the scoffer and the infidel , the libertine and the assassin . "
32776	32880	32565	32566	the father	807	" You see how beautifully your father puts it , Eliza ; but he never abuses people . That is a habit in which , I am sorry to say , you indulge too freely . You show no good feeling to anybody who differs from you in opinion , and you talk as if Frenchmen had no religion , no principles , and no humanity . And what do you know about them , pray ? Have you ever spoken to a Frenchman ? Have you ever even seen one ? Would you know one if you even set eyes upon him ? "
32881	32894	32895	32897	the young lady	1315	" Well , I am not at all sure that I should , "
32904	32943	32895	32897	the young lady	1315	" and I have no wish for the opportunity . But I have seen a French woman , mother ; and that is quite enough for me . If they are so , what must the men be ? "
32944	33018	32565	32566	the father	807	" There is a name for this process of feminine reasoning , this cumulative and syncopetic process of the mind , entirely feminine but regarded by itself as rational , a name which I used to know well in the days when I had the ten Fallacies at my fingers ' ends , more tenaciously perhaps than the Decalogue . Strange to say , the name is gone from my memory ; but but "
33019	33032	33033	33034	his wife	6501	" But then you had better go after it , my dear , "
33039	33066	33033	33034	his wife	6501	" If your only impulse when you hear reason is to search after hard names for it , you are safer outside of its sphere altogether . "
33067	33078	33080	33081	the rector	909	" I am struck with the truth of that remark , "
33083	33125	33080	33081	the rector	909	" and the more so because I descry a male member of our race approaching , with a hat at once the emblem and the crown of sound reason . Away with all fallacies ; it is Church - warden Cheeseman ! "
33131	33145	33146	33147	Lord Nelson	276	" Can you guess what has brought me down here in this hurry ? "
33193	33243	33249	33250	the Admiral	747	" I have no time to spare not a day , not an hour ; but I made up my mind to see you before I start . I can not expect to come home alive , and , except for one reason , I should not wish it . "
33244	33247	33249	33250	the Admiral	747	" Nonsense ! "
33269	33304	33249	33250	the Admiral	747	" you are always in such a confounded hurry ! When you come to my time of life , you will know better . What is it this time ? The Channel fleet again ? "
33305	33352	33249	33250	the Admiral	747	" No , no ; Billy Blue keeps that , thank God ! I hate looking after a school of herring - boats . The Mediterranean for me , my friend . I received the order yesterday , and shall be at sea by the twentieth . "
33353	33415	33249	33250	the Admiral	747	" I am very glad to hear it , for your sake . If ever there was a restless fellow in the good old times we were not like that . Come up to the house and talk about it ; at least they must take the horses out . They are not like you ; they ca n't work forever . "
33416	33475	33249	33250	the Admiral	747	" And they do n't get knocked about like me ; though one of them has lost his starboard eye , and he sails and steers all the better for it . Let them go up to the stable , Darling , while you come down to the beach with me . I want to show you something . "
33476	33487	33494	33494	himself	1446	" What crotchet is in his too active brain now ? "
33528	33594	33497	33497	he	1446	" Why , this is not the way to the beach ! However , it is never any good to oppose him . He gets his own way so because of his fame . Or perhaps that 's the way he got his fame . But to show me about over my own land ! But let him go on , let him go on . "
33595	33609	33611	33611	Nelson	276	" You are wondering , I dare say , what I am about , "
33646	33940	33627	33627	he	276	" but now I shall be able to convince you , though I am not a land - surveyor , nor even a general of land - forces . If God Almighty prolongs my life which is not very likely it will be that I may meet that scoundrel , Napoleon Bonaparte , on dry land . I hear that he is eager to encounter me on the waves , himself commanding a line - of - battle ship . I should send him to the devil in a quarter of an hour . And ashore I could astonish him , I think , a little , if I had a good army to back me up . Remember what I did at Bastia , in the land that produced this monster , and where I was called the Brigadier ; and again , upon the coast of Italy , I showed that I understood all their dry - ground business . Tush ! I can beat him , ashore and afloat ; and I shall , if I live long enough . But this time the villain is in earnest , I believe , with his trumpery invasion ; and as soon as he hears that I am gone , he will make sure of having his own way . We know , of course , there are fifty men as good as myself to stop him , including you , my dear Darling ; but everything goes by reputation the noise of the people praise - puff . That 's all I get ; while the luckier fellows , like Cathcart , get the prize - money . But I do n't want to grumble . Now what do you see ? "
33941	33952	33953	33954	the Admiral	747	" Well , I see you , for one thing , "
33971	34051	33958	33958	his	747	" and wearing a coat that would be a disgrace to any other man in the navy . And further on I see some land that I never shall get my rent for ; and beyond that nothing but the sea , with a few fishing - craft inshore , and in the offing a sail , an outward - bound East Indiaman some fool who would n't wait for convoy , with war as good as proclaimed again . "
34052	34158	33627	33627	he	276	" Nothing but the sea , indeed ? The sweep of the land , and the shelter of the bay , the shoaling of the shore without a rock to break it , the headland that shuts out both wind and waves ; and outside the headland , off Pebbleridge , deep water for a fleet of line - of - battle ships to anchor and command the land approaches moreover , a stream of the purest water from deep and never - failing springs Darling , the place of all places in England for the French to land is opposite to your front door . "
34159	34216	33627	33627	he	276	" I am truly obliged to you for predicting , and to them for doing it , if ever they attempt such impudence . If they find out that you are away , they can also find out that I am here , as commander of the sea defences , from Dungeness to Selsey - Bill . "
34217	34488	33958	33958	his	747	" That will make it all the more delightful to land at your front door , my friend ; and all the easier to do it . My own plan is to strike with all force at the head - quarters of the enemy , because the most likely to be unprepared . About a year ago , when I was down here , a little before my dear father 's death , without your commission I took command of your fishing - craft coming home for their Sunday , and showed them how to take the beach , partly to confirm my own suspicions . There is no other landing on all the south coast , this side of Hayling Island , fit to be compared with it for the use of flat - bottomed craft , such as most of Boney 's are . And remember the set of the tide , which makes the fortunes of your fishermen . To be sure , he knows nothing of that himself ; but he has sharp rogues about him . If they once made good their landing here , it would be difficult to dislodge them . It must all be done from the land side then , for even a 42 - gun frigate could scarcely come near enough to pepper them . They love shoal water , the skulks and that has enabled them to baffle me so often . Not that they would conquer the country all brag but still it would be a nasty predicament , and scare the poor cockneys like the very devil . "
34489	34529	33627	33627	he	276	" But remember the distance from Boulogne , Hurry . If they can not cross twenty - five miles of channel in the teeth of our ships , what chance would they have when the distance is nearer eighty ? "
34530	34684	33627	33627	he	276	" A much better chance , if they knew how to do it . All our cruisers would be to the eastward . One afternoon perhaps , when a haze is on , they make a feint with light craft toward the Scheldt every British ship crowds sail after them . Then , at dusk , the main body of the expedition slips with the first of the ebb to the westward ; they meet the flood tide in mid - channel , and using their long sweeps are in Springhaven , or at any rate the lightest of them , by the top of that tide , just when you are shaving . You laugh at such a thought of mine . I tell you , my dear friend , that with skill and good luck it is easy ; and do it they should , if they were under my command . "
34769	34788	34789	34789	he	332	" Happily they are not under your command , and they have no man to compare with you ; "
34810	34919	34799	34799	he	276	" and if it were possible for you to talk nonsense , I should say that you had done it now . But two things surely you have overlooked . In the first place , the French can have no idea of the special opportunities this place affords . And again , if they had , they could do nothing , without a pilot well acquainted with the spot . Though the landing is so easy , there are shoals outside , very intricate and dangerous , and known to none except the natives of the place , who are jealous to the last degree about their knowledge . "
34920	34960	34789	34789	he	332	" That is true enough ; and even I should want a pilot here , though I know every spit of sand eastward . But away fly both your difficulties if there should happen to be a local traitor . "
34961	35008	34799	34799	he	276	" A traitor at Springhaven ! Such a thing is quite impossible . You would laugh at yourself , if you only knew the character of our people . There never has been , and there never will be , a Springhaven man capable of treachery . "
35009	35022	35023	35024	the visitor	1457	" That is good news , ay , and strange news too , "
35046	35379	35023	35024	the visitor	1457	" There are not many traitors in England , I believe ; but they are as likely to be found in one place as another , according to my experience . Well , well , I am very glad you have no such scoundrels here . I wo n't say a single word against your people , who are as fine a lot as any in the south of England , and as obstinate as any I could wish to see . Of an obstinate man I can always make good ; with a limp one I can do nothing . But bear in mind every word you have heard me say , because I came down on purpose about it ; and I generally penetrate the devices of the enemy , though they lead me on a wild - goose - chase sometimes , but only when our own folk back them up , either by lies or stupidity . Now look once more , for you are slower as well as a great deal wiser than I am . You see how this land - locked bight of Springhaven seems made by the Almighty for flat - bottomed craft , if once they can find their way into it ; while the trend of the coast towards Pebbleridge is equally suited for the covering fleet , unless a gale from southwest comes on , in which case they must run for it . And you see that the landed force , by crowning the hill above your house and across the valley , might defy our noble Volunteers , and all that could be brought against them , till a hundred thousand cutthroats were established here . And Boney would make his head - quarters at the Hall , with a French cook in your kitchen , and a German butler in your cellar , and my pretty godchild to wait upon him , for the rogue loves pretty maidens . "
35380	35435	35443	35447	the great sea - captain	1458	" That will do . That is quite enough . No wonder you have written poems , Nelson , as you told us the last time you were here . If my son had only got your imagination but perhaps you know something more than you have told me . Perhaps you have been told "
35436	35442	35443	35447	the great sea - captain	1458	" Never mind about that , "
35457	35478	35443	35447	the great sea - captain	1458	" it is high time for me to be off again , and my chaise has springs on her cables . "
35479	35621	35443	35447	the great sea - captain	1458	" Not she . I have ordered her to be docked . Dine with us you shall this day , if we have to dine two hours earlier , and though Mother Cloam rage furiously . How much longer do you suppose you can carry on at this pace ? Look at me . I have double your bodily substance ; but if I went on as you do you remember the twenty - four - pounder old Hotcoppers put into the launch , and fired it , in spite of all I could say to him ? Well , you are just the same . You have not got the scantling for the metal you carry and are always working . You will either blow up , or else scuttle yourself . Look here , how your seams are opening ! "
35652	35682	35626	35626	his	332	" Yes , and you will go in the very same way . I wonder how any coat lasts so much as a month , with you inside it . "
35683	35687	35689	35689	Nelson	276	" This coat , "
35712	35806	35626	35626	his	332	" this coat is the one I wore at Copenhagen , and a sounder and kinder coat never came on a man 's back . Charles Darling , you have made a bad hit this time . If I am no more worn out than this coat is , I am fit to go to sea for a number of years yet . And I hope to show it to a good many Frenchmen , and take as many ships , every time they show fight , as there are buttons on it . "
35807	35819	35689	35689	Nelson	276	" Then you will double all your captures at the Nile ; "
35842	35844	35626	35626	his	332	" domestic "
35846	35923	35940	35940	his	276	" but you may be trusted not to let them drift so . You have given me a lesson in coast - defence , and now you shall be boarded by the ladies . You possess some gifts of the tongue , my friend , as well as great gifts of hand and eye ; but I will back my daughters to beat you there . Come up to the house . No turning of tail . "
35924	35935	35937	35937	Nelson	276	" I spoke very well in the House of Lords , "
35944	35988	35937	35937	Nelson	276	" in reply to the speech of his Majesty , and again about the Commissioner 's Bill ; or at least everybody tells me so . But in the House of Ladies I hold my tongue , because there is abundance without it . "
36059	36065	36066	36066	she	277	" He shall do it , "
36080	36103	36066	36066	she	277	" if I have to kiss him , he shall do it ; and I do n't like kissing those old men . "
36104	36107	36109	36111	her elder sister	999	" Hush ! "
36113	36159	36066	36066	she	277	" Dolly , you do say things so recklessly . One would think that you liked to kiss younger men ! But I am sure that is not your meaning . I would rather kiss Lord Nelson than all the young men in the kingdom . "
36160	36210	36109	36111	her elder sister	999	" Well done , Faith ! All the young men in the kingdom ! How recklessly you do say things ! And you ca n't kiss him he is MY godfather . But just see how I get round him , if you have wits enough to understand it . "
36401	36413	36415	36417	the vanquished warrior	1475	" After that , there is nothing more to be said , "
36419	36545	36415	36417	the vanquished warrior	1475	" but the daughters of an Admiral should know that no man can be posted until he has served his time as lieutenant ; and this young hero of yours has never even held the King 's commission yet . But as he has seen some service , and is beyond the age of a middy , in the present rush he might get appointed as junior lieutenant , if he had any stout seconders . Your father is the man , he is always at hand , and can watch his opportunity . He knows more big - wigs than I do , and he has not given offence where I have . Get your father , my dears , to attend to it . "
37539	37543	37506	37506	she	300	" tops and bottoms "
37596	37600	37587	37588	the lady	1524	" our ship , "
38403	38417	38379	38379	he	1548	" Is this , then , the establishment of the illustrious Mr. Cheeseman ? "
38457	38469	38470	38470	he	1555	" This is the shop of the ' umble James Cheeseman , "
38481	38508	38470	38470	he	1555	" All things good that are in season , and nothing kept unseasonable . With what can I have the honor of serving you , sir ? "
38509	38515	38516	38517	The stranger	1556	" With a little talk . "
38538	38541	38470	38470	he	1555	" aristocratic . "
38542	38557	38559	38559	Cheeseman	301	" To talk with a gentleman is a pleasure as well as an honour , "
38561	38569	38559	38559	Cheeseman	301	" But not in this public establishment . "
38595	38615	38570	38571	The visitor	1457	" It is fine , Mr. Cheeseman ; but it is not bah , I forget your English words . "
38616	38630	38576	38576	he	1548	" It is fine , sir , as you are good enough to observe "
38640	38721	38570	38571	The visitor	1457	" but not , as you remarked , altogether private . That can hardly be expected , where business is conducted to suit universal requirements . Polly , my dear , if your mother can spare you , come and take my place at the desk a few minutes . I have business inside with this gentleman . You may sell almost anything , except butter . If any one wants that , they must wait till I come back . "
38781	38787	38789	38789	Polly	291	" What a handsome gentleman ! "
38793	38807	38789	38789	Polly	291	" but there is something very sad and very wild in his appearance . "
38829	38845	38846	38847	the stranger	1556	" There is no cause for apologies . This place is a very good one , "
38872	38919	38920	38920	He	1556	" You are a man of business , and I am come upon dry business . You can conjecture is it not so ? who I am by this time , although I am told that I do not bear any strong resemblance to my father . "
38981	39082	38965	38965	he	1556	" I am Caryl Carne , of Carne Castle , as you are pleased to call it . I have not been in England these many years ; from the death of my father I have been afar ; and now , for causes of my own , I am returned , with hope of collecting the fragments of the property of my ancestors . It appears to have been their custom to scatter , but not gather up again . My intention is to make a sheaf of the relics spread by squanderers , and snapped up by scoundrels . "
39083	39092	39094	39096	the general dealer	1569	" To be sure , to be sure , "
39098	39145	39094	39096	the general dealer	1569	" this is vastly to your credit , sir , and I wish you all success , sir , and so will all who have so long respected your ancient and honourable family , sir . Take a chair , sir please to take a chair . "
39146	39155	39156	39157	Mr. Carne	356	" I find very little to my credit , "
39178	39209	39171	39171	his	356	" but among that little is a bond from you , given nearly twenty years agone , and of which you will retain , no doubt , a vivid recollection . "
39210	39218	39220	39221	the other	893	" A bond , sir a bond ! "
39235	39263	39220	39221	the other	893	" I never signed a bond in all my life , sir . Why , a bond requires sureties , and nobody ever went surety for me . "
39264	39306	39171	39171	his	356	" Bond may not be the proper legal term . It is possible . I know nothing of the English law . But a document it is , under hand and seal , and your signature is witnessed , Mr. Cheeseman . "
39307	39361	39171	39171	his	356	" Ah well ! Let me consider . I begin to remember something . But my memory is not as it used to be , and twenty years makes a great hole in it . Will you kindly allow me to see this paper , if you have it with you , sir ? "
39362	39400	39220	39221	the other	893	" It is not a paper ; it is written upon parchment , and I have not brought it with me . But I have written down the intention of it , and it is as follows : "
39577	39578	39639	39639	I	0	" "
39591	39612	39639	39639	I	0	" Mr. Cheeseman said , with that exalted candour which made a weak customer condemn his own eyes and nose , "
39676	39677	39679	39680	a man	6583	" "
39695	39710	39679	39680	a man	6583	" pursued the visitor , suggesting a small kick to a pile of ledgers , "
39879	39901	39876	39877	Mr. Cheeseman	301	" That enterprising merchant , importer of commodities , and wholesale and retail dealer was fond of assuring his numerous friends that "
39909	40029	39876	39877	Mr. Cheeseman	301	" But some of them now would have doubted about this if they had watched his face as carefully as Caryl Carne was watching it . Mr. Cheeseman could look a hundred people in the face , and with great vigour too , when a small account was running . But the sad , contemptuous , and piercing gaze as if he were hardly worth penetrating and the twirl of the black tuft above the lip , and the firm conviction on the broad white forehead that it was confronting a rogue too common and shallow to be worth frowning at all these , and the facts that were under them , came amiss to the true James Cheeseman . "
40038	40057	40058	40058	I	0	" he said , being clever enough to suppose that a dash of candour might sweeten the embroilment . "
40180	40181	40169	40169	his	0	" "
40186	40194	40169	40169	his	0	" replied the young man , coldly , "
40334	40335	40339	40339	sir	6639	" "
40391	40392	40393	40393	Your	301	" "
40571	40572	40575	40575	sir	6639	" "
40591	40613	40614	40614	We	1608	" cried Cheeseman a man of fine liberal vein , whenever two half - crowns were as good as a crown . "
40673	40674	40680	40682	the London Trader	1507	" "
40727	40728	40729	40729	She	1614	" "
40783	40784	40768	40768	She	1614	" "
40791	40796	40788	40788	my	0	" Caryl Carne replied , "
40889	40889	40839	40839	your	6639	"
40939	40947	40949	40953	the able - bodied men	1623	" Let them land if they can , "
40962	40996	40949	40953	the able - bodied men	1623	" they wo n't find it so easy to get away again as they seem to put into their reckoning . But the plague of it all is the damage to the fishing . "
41025	41030	40949	40953	the able - bodied men	1623	" Sea - Fencibles . "
42211	42221	42222	42222	she	277	" What is the use of having any influence , "
42228	42320	42222	42222	she	277	" unless you employ it for your own friends ? I should be quite ashamed to have it said of me , or thought , that I could get a good thing for any one I was fond of , and was mean enough not to do it , for fear of paltry jealousy . Mean is much too weak a word ; it is downright dishonest , and what is much worse , cowardly . What is the government meant for , unless it is to do good to people ? "
42321	42349	42222	42222	she	277	" Certainly , my dear child , certainly . To the people at large , that is to say , and the higher interests of the country . "
42350	42434	42444	42445	the Admiral	747	" Can there be any people more at large than Captain Stubbard and his wife and children ? Their elbows are coming out of their clothes , and they have scarcely got a bed to sleep upon . My income is not enough to stop to count , even when I get it paid punctually . But every farthing I receive shall go that is to say , if it ever does come into the lap of Mrs. Stubbard , anonymously and respectfully . "
42435	42442	42444	42445	the Admiral	747	" Pay your bills , first , "
42456	42473	42444	42445	the Admiral	747	" a little bird tells me that you owe a good trifle , even in Springhaven . "
42474	42485	42487	42487	Dolly	277	" Then the little bird has got a false bill , "
42497	42591	42487	42487	Dolly	277	" Who is there to spend sixpence with in a little hole of this kind ? I am not a customer for tea , coffee , tobacco , snuff , or pepper , nor even for whiting , soles , or conger . Old Cheeseman imports all the fashions , as he says ; but I go by my own judgment . And trumpery as my income is , very little of it goes into his till . But I should like to know who told you such a wicked story , father ? "
42592	42605	42607	42608	the Admiral	747	" Things are mentioned in confidence , and I put them together , "
42610	42764	42607	42608	the Admiral	747	" Do n't say another word , or look as if you would be happier if you had something to cry about . Your dear mother used to do it ; and it beats me always . I have long had my eye upon Captain Stubbard , and I remember well that gallant action when his three ribs flew away . We called him Adam , because of his wife coming just when his middle rib went , and his name was Adam Stubbard , sure enough . Such men , in the prime of their life , should be promoted , instead of being disabled , for a scratch like that . Why , he walks every bit as well as I do , and his watch - ribbon covers it . And nine children ! Lord bless my heart ! I scarcely know which way to turn , with only four ! "
42849	42867	42869	42870	the Captain	1173	" These are the things that prove the eye of an All - wise Providence over us , "
42890	42907	42869	42870	the Captain	1173	" these are the things that make one feel the force of the words of David . "
42908	42917	42919	42922	the gallant senior officer	1677	" Certainly , yes , to be sure ! "
42933	43000	42869	42870	the Captain	1173	" Good legs they have got , and no mistake ; like the polished corners of the temple . Let them go and dip them in the sea , while you give the benefit of your opinion here . Not here , I mean , but upon Fox - hill yonder ; if Mrs. Stubbard will spare you for a couple of hours , most kindly . "
43202	43210	43212	43213	the Admiral	747	" It would take a better Frenchman , "
43229	43308	43212	43213	the Admiral	747	" than any of ' they flat - bottoms , ' as Swipes , my gardener , calls them , to get through these prickles , Stubbard , without Sark - blewing . Such a wonderfully thin - skinned lot they are ! Did I ever tell you the story of our boatswain 's mate ? But that takes a better sailing breeze than I 've got now . You see where we are , do n't you ? "
43309	43314	43316	43317	Captain Stubbard	391	" Certainly , Admiral , "
43335	43412	43316	43317	Captain Stubbard	391	" we have had a long pull , and we get a fine outlook over the country for leagues , and the Channel . How close at hand everything looks ! I suppose we shall have rain , and we want it . I could thump that old castle among the trees into smash , and your church looks as if I could put a shot with a rifle - gun into the bell - chamber . "
43413	43473	43212	43213	the Admiral	747	" And so you could . What I want to show you is that very point , and the importance of it . With a battery of long twenty - fours up here , the landing , the bay , and all the roads are at our mercy . My dear old friend Nelson drew my attention to it . "
43474	43489	43490	43491	Captain Stubbard	391	" It is plain as a pikestaff to Tom , Dick , or Harry : "
43519	43580	43514	43514	he	391	" But why should we want to command this spot ? There is nothing to protect but a few common houses , and some half - score of fishing - craft , and a schooner that trades to London , and yonder old church , and oh yes , to be sure , your own house and property , Admiral . "
43581	43632	43212	43213	the Admiral	747	" Those must take their chance , like others . I hope I know better than to think of them in comparison with the good of the country . But if we fail to occupy this important post , the enemy might take us by surprise , and do so . "
43633	43691	43514	43514	he	391	" Possible , but most improbable . This little place lies , by the trend of the coast , quite out of their course from Boulogne to London ; and what is there here to tempt them ? No rich town to sack , no great commerce to rob , no valuable shipping to lay hands on . "
43692	43756	43514	43514	he	391	" No ; but there 's my house and my two girls ; and I do n't want my old roof burned , and my daughters put to wait on Boney . But to think of self - interest is below contempt , with our country going through such trials . Neither should we add any needless expense to a treasury already overburdened . "
43757	43791	43212	43213	the Admiral	747	" Certainly not . It would be absolutely wicked . We have a long and costly war before us , and not a shilling should be spent except in case of clear necessity . "
43792	43813	43514	43514	he	391	" I am very glad indeed to find your opinion so decided , so untainted with petty self - interest . "
43839	43984	43818	43818	he	332	" I thought it my duty to consult you , Stubbard , before despatching this letter , which , being backed by Nelson 's opinion , would probably have received attention . If a strong battery were thrown up here , as it would be in a fortnight from the receipt of this bit of foolscap , the appointment of commandant would rest with me , and I could appoint nobody but your good self , because of your well - known experience in earthworks . The appointment would have doubled your present pay , which , though better than nothing , is far below your merits . But your opinion settles the question otherwise , and I must burn my letter . Let us lose no more time . Mrs. Stubbard will call me a savage , for keeping you away so long . "
43985	43989	43991	43992	the Captain	1173	" Important business , "
43994	44140	43991	43992	the Captain	1173	" will not wait even for ladies , or , rather , they must try to wait for it , and give way to more reasonable urgency . Some time is required for considering this matter , and deciding what is most for the interest of the nation . Oblige me with your spy - glass , Admiral . There is one side on which I have neglected to look out , and that may of all be the most important . A conclusion arrived at by yourself and Nelson is not to be hastily set aside . Your knowledge of the country is so far beyond mine , though I may have had more to do with land - works . We ought to think twice , sir , if the government will pay for it , about a valuable job of this kind . "
44318	44321	44323	44324	the Admiral	747	" Well , "
44337	44368	44323	44324	the Admiral	747	" what conclusion do you feel inclined to come to ? ' Tis a fine breezy place to clear the brain , and a briny air to sharpen the judgment . "
44369	44384	44385	44386	Captain Stubbard	391	" Only one tree need come down this crooked one at the southeast corner . "
44402	44592	44390	44390	his	391	" All gentlemen hate to have a tree cut down , all blackguards delight in the process . Admiral , we will not hurt your trees . They will add to our strength , by masking it . Six long twenty - fours of the new make , here in front , and two eighteens upon either flank , and I should like to see the whole of the Boulogne flotilla try to take yonder shore by daylight . That is to say , of course , if I commanded , with good old salts to second me . With your common artillery officers , landlubbers , smell - the - wicks , cross - the - braces sons of guns , there had better not be anything at all put up . They ca n't make a fortification ; and when they have made it , they ca n't work it . Admiral Darling , you know that , though you have not had the bad luck to deal with them as I have . I may thank one of them for being up here on the shelf . "
44593	44603	44605	44610	the commander of the sea defence	1704	" Of one thing you may be quite certain , "
44612	44686	44605	44610	the commander of the sea defence	1704	" if we have any battery on this Fox - hill , it shall be constructed and manned by blue - jackets . I have a large draft of them now at discretion . Every man in Springhaven will lend a hand , if paid for it . It would take at least a twelvemonth to get it done from Woolwich . A seaman does a thing before a landsman thinks about it . "
44823	44828	44829	44829	they	1707	" Everything upside down , "
44832	44924	44829	44829	they	1707	" everything gone clean topsy - turvy ! And the deep meaning of it is to rob our fishing , under pretence of the Nationals . It may bring a good bit of money to the place , for the lining of one or two pockets , such as John Prater 's and Cheeseman 's ; but I never did hold so much with money , when shattery ways comes along of it . No daughter of mine stirs out - of - doors after sundown , I can tell them . "
44962	44973	44956	44956	they	6658	" I 'll tell you what I think , ma'am , "
44983	45033	44974	44975	Mrs. Cheeseman	300	" if you take a farthing less than half a guinea a week for your dimity - parlour , with the window up the hill , and the little door under the big sweet - briar , I shall think that you are not as you used to be . "
45034	45048	45049	45050	Mrs. Shanks	302	" And right you would be , ma'am , and too right there ; "
45059	45210	45054	45054	she	302	" There is nobody but you can understand it , and I do n't mind saying it on that account to you . Whenever I have wanted for a little bit of money , as the nature of lone widows generally does , it has always been out of your power , Mrs. Cheeseman , to oblige me , and quite right of you . But I have a good son , thank the Lord , by the name of Harry , to provide for me ; and a guinea a week is the agreement now for the dimity - parlour , and the three leg'd bed , and cold dinner to be paid for extra , such as I might send for to your good shop , with the money ready in the hand of my little girl , and jug below her apron for refreshment from the Darling . "
45211	45250	45049	45050	Mrs. Shanks	302	" Well , I never ! My dear soul , you have taken all my breath away . Why , it must be the captain of all the gunners . How gunpowder do pay , to be sure ! "
45251	45263	45265	45266	Mrs. Shanks	302	" Lor , ma'am , why , do n't you know , "
45272	45357	45265	45266	Mrs. Shanks	302	" that the man with three ribs is the captain of the gunners the man in my back sitting - room ? No dimity - parlour for him with his family , not for a guinea and a half a week . But if I was to tell you who the gentleman is , and one of the highest all round these parts , truthful as you know me , Mrs. Cheeseman , you would say to yourself , what a liar she is ! "
45358	45409	45049	45050	Mrs. Shanks	302	" Mrs. Shanks , I never use coarse expressions , even to myself in private . And perhaps I could tell you a thing or two would astonish you more than me , ma'am . Suppose I should tell you , to begin with , who your guinea lodger is ? "
45410	45450	45265	45266	Mrs. Shanks	302	" That you could never do , Mrs. Cheeseman , with all your time a - counting changes . He is not of the rank for a twopenny rasher , or a wedge of cheese packed in old petticoat . "
45546	45553	45555	45559	the wife of Mr. Cheeseman	1719	" His rank may be royal , "
45561	45602	45555	45559	the wife of Mr. Cheeseman	1719	" though a going - downhill kind of royalty , perhaps , and yet he might be glad , Mrs. Shanks , to come where the butter has the milk spots , and none is in the cheese , ma'am . "
45603	45656	45670	45671	Mrs. Cheeseman	300	" If such should be his wish , ma'am , for supper or for breakfast , or even for dinner on a Sunday when the rain comes through the Castle , you may trust me to know where to send him , but not to guarantee him at all of his money . "
45657	45669	45670	45671	Mrs. Cheeseman	300	" They high ones is very apt to slip in that , "
45676	45837	45670	45671	Mrs. Cheeseman	300	" they seem to be less particular in paying for a thing than they was to have it good . But a burnt child dreads the fire , as they say ; and a young man with a castleful of owls and rats , by reason of going for these hundred years on credit , will have it brought home to him to pay ready money . But the Lord be over us ! if I do n't see him a - going your way already ! Good - by , my dear soul good - by , and preserve you ; and if at any time short of table or bed linen , a loan from an old friend , and coming back well washed , and it sha'n't be , as the children sing , ' A friend with a loan has the pick of your bone , and he wo n't let you very long alone . ' "
45838	45849	45851	45852	the widow	1720	" Many thanks to you for friendly meaning , ma'am , "
45864	45990	45851	45852	the widow	1720	" and glad I may be to profit by it , with the time commanding . But as yet I have had neither sleepers or feeders in my little house , but the children . Though both of them reserves the right to do it , if nature should so compel them the three - ribbed gentleman with one ear , at five shillings a week , in the sitting - room , and the young man up over him . Their meaning is for business , and studying , and keeping of accounts , and having of a quiet place in bad weather , though feed they must , sooner or later , I depend ; and then who is there but Mr. Cheeseman ? "
45991	46013	46022	46022	she	1722	" How grand he do look upon that black horse , quite as solid as if he was glued to it ! "
46028	46119	46022	46022	she	1722	" and to do that without victuals is beyond a young man 's power . He looks like what they used to call a knight upon an errand , in the picture - books , when I was romantic , only for the hair that comes under his nose . Ah ! his errand will be to break the hearts of the young ladies that goes down upon the sands in their blue gowns , I 'm afraid , if they can only manage with the hair below his nose . "
46120	46220	46022	46022	she	1722	" And do them good , some of them , and be a judgment from the Lord , for the French style in their skirts is a shocking thing to see . What should we have said when you and I were young , my dear ? But quick step is the word for me , for I expect my Jenny home on her day out from the Admiral , and no Harry in the house to look after her . Ah ! dimity - parlours is a thing as may happen to cut both ways , Mrs. Cheeseman . "
46325	46332	46309	46309	they	1730	" never is a long time , "
47414	47427	47428	47428	she	1775	" And what do they say of him up at the Hall ? "
47443	47516	47428	47428	she	1775	" What do they say of my new gentleman , young Squire Carne from the Castle ? The Carnes and the Darlings was never great friends , as every one knows in Springhaven . Still , it do seem hard and unchristianlike to keep up them old enmities ; most of all , when the one side is down in the world , with the owls and the bats and the coneys . "
47517	47532	47534	47534	Jenny	311	" No , mother , no . They are not a bit like that , "
47541	47573	47534	47534	Jenny	311	" it is only that he has not called upon them . All gentlefolks have their proper rules of behaviour . You ca n't be expected to understand them , mother . "
47574	47684	47428	47428	she	1775	" But why should he go to them more than they should come to him , particular with young ladies there ? And him with only one horse to their seven or eight . I am right , you may depend upon it , Jenny ; and my mother , your grandmother , was a lady's - maid in a higher family than Darling it depends upon them to come and look him up first , and he have no call to knock at their door without it . Why , it stands to reason , poor young man ! And not a bit hath he eaten from Monday . "
47685	47750	47534	47534	Jenny	311	" Well , I believe I am right , but I 'll ask Miss Dolly . She is that sharp , she knows everything , and I do n't mind what I say to her , when she thinks that she looks handsome . And it takes a very bad dress , I can tell you , to put her out of that opinion . "
47751	47758	47428	47428	she	1775	" She is right enough there : "
47773	47892	47762	47762	her	302	" The ugliest frock as ever came from France could n't make her any but a booty . And the Lord knows the quality have come to queer shapes now . Undecent would be the name for it in our ranks of women . Why , the last of her frocks she gave you , Jenny , how much did I put on , at top and bottom , and you three inches shorter than she is ! And the slips they ties round them oh dear ! oh dear ! as if that was to hold them up and buckle them together ! Wo n't they have the groanings by the time they come to my age ? "
48063	48070	48072	48073	the Rector	909	" Do n't go near him , "
48087	48279	48072	48073	the Rector	909	" it would ill become me to say a word against my dear wife 's own nephew , and the representative of her family . And , to the utmost of my knowledge , there is nothing to be said against him . But I ca n't get on with him at all . I do n't know why . He has only honored us with a visit twice , and he would not even come to dinner . Nice manners they learn on the Continent ! But none of us wept when he declined ; not even his good aunt , my wife . Though he must have got a good deal to tell us , and an extraordinary knowledge of foreign ways . But instead of doing that , he seems to sneer at us . I can look at a question from every point of view , and I defy anybody to call me narrow - minded . But still , one must draw the line somewhere , or throw overboard all principles ; and I draw it , my dear Admiral , against infidels and against Frenchmen . "
48280	48287	48288	48289	the Admiral	747	" No rational person can do otherwise "
48294	48431	48288	48289	the Admiral	747	" but this young man is of good English birth , and one ca n't help feeling sorry for his circumstances . And I assure you , Twemlow , that I feel respect as well for the courage that he shows , and the perseverance , in coming home and facing those vile usurers . And your own wife 's nephew ! Why , you ought to take his part through thick and thin , whatever you may think of him . From all I hear he must be a young man of exceedingly high principle ; and I shall make a point of calling upon him the first half - hour I get to spare . To - morrow , if possible ; or if not , the day after , at the very latest . "
49075	49079	49116	49116	He	356	" good - night "
49177	49186	49187	49187	he	356	" Almost as good as France is this , "
49203	49490	49187	49187	he	356	" and better than France would it be , if only it were not cut short so suddenly . There will come a cold wind by - and - by , or a chilly black cloud from the east , and then all is shivers and rawness . But if it only remained like this , I could forgive it for producing me . After all , it is my native land ; and I saw the loveliest girl to - day that ever I set eyes on . None of their made - up and highly finished demoiselles is fit to look at her such simple beauty , such charms of nature , such enchanting innocence ! Ah , that is where those French girls fail they are always studying how they look , instead of leaving us to think of it . Bah ! What odds to me ? I have higher stakes to play for . But according to old Twemlow 's description , she must be the daughter of that old bear Darling , with whom I shall have to pick a bone some day . Ha ! How amusing is that battery to me ! How little John Bull knows the nature of French troops ! To - morrow we are to have a grand practice - day ; and I hope they wo n't shoot me in my new lodgings . Nothing is impossible to such an idiot as Stubbard . What a set of imbeciles I have found to do with ! They have scarcely wit enough to amuse oneself with . Pest of my soul ! Is that you , Charron ? Again you have broken my orders . "
49491	49501	49503	49518	the man , who was swinging on a gate with the simple delight of a Picard	1843	" Names should be avoided in the open air , "
49520	49592	49503	49518	the man , who was swinging on a gate with the simple delight of a Picard	1843	" The climate is of France so much to - night that I found it my duty to encourage it . For what reason shall not I do that ? It is not so often that I have occasion . My dear friend , scold not , but accept the compliment very seldom truthful to your native land . There are none of your clod - pates about to - night . "
49593	49635	49187	49187	he	356	" Come in at once . The mere sound of your breath is enough to set the neighbourhood wondering . Could I ever have been burdened with a more French Frenchman , though you speak as good English as I do ? "
49636	49645	49646	49648	the French gentleman	1844	" It was all of that miserable Cheray , "
49668	49882	49659	49660	Jerry Bowles	366	" Fruit is a thing that my mouth prepares for , directly there is any warmth in the sun . It puts itself up , it is elevated , it will not have meat , or any substance coarse . Wine of the softest and fruit of the finest is what it must then have , or unmouth itself . That miserable Cheray , his maledictioned name put me forth to be on fire for the good thing he designs . Cherays you call them , and for cherays I despatched him , suspended between the leaves in the good sun . Bah ! there is nothing ever fit to eat in England . The cherays look very fine , very fine indeed ; and so many did I consume that to travel on a gate was the only palliation . Would you have me stay all day in this long cellar ? No diversion , no solace , no change , no conversation ! Old Cheray may sit with his hands upon his knees , but to Renaud Charron that is not sufficient . How much longer before I sally forth to do the things , to fight , to conquer the nations ? Where is even my little ship of despatch ? "
49883	49886	49888	49889	Caryl Carne	356	" Captain , "
49898	49985	49888	49889	Caryl Carne	356	" you are placed under my command , and another such speech will despatch you to Dunkirk , bound hand and foot , in the hold of the Little Corporal , with which I am now in communication . Unless by the time I have severed this bone you hand me your sword in submission , my supper will have to be postponed , while I march you to the yew - tree , signal for a boat , and lay you strapped beneath the oarsmen . "
50116	50132	50133	50133	Carne	356	" This behaviour is sensible , my friend , and worthy of your distinguished abilities . "
50154	50226	50313	50313	he	1852	" Pardon me for speaking strongly , but my instructions must be the law to you . If you were my commander as , but for local knowledge , and questions of position here , you would be , do you think then that you would allow me to rebel , to grumble , to wander , to demand my own pleasure , when you knew that it would ruin things ? "
50227	50287	50313	50313	he	1852	" Bravo ! It is well spoken . My captain , I embrace you . In you lives the spirit of the Grand Army , which we of the sea and of the ships admire always , and always desire to emulate . Ah , if England possessed many Englishmen like you , she would be hard to conquer . "
50321	50478	50313	50313	he	1852	" Our business here demands the greatest caution , skill , reserve , and self - denial . We are fortunate in having no man of any keen penetration in the neighbourhood , at least of those in authority and concerned with public matters . As one of an ancient family , possessing the land for centuries , I have every right to be here , and to pursue my private business in privacy . But if it once gets talked about that a French officer is with me , these stupid people will awake their suspicions more strongly by their own stupidity . In this queer island you may do what you like till the neighbourhood turns against you ; and then , if you revolve upon a pin , you can not suit them . You understand ? You have heard me before . It is this that I never can knock into you . "
50519	50525	50526	50527	the Englishman	1857	" Nothing can be simpler , "
50530	50822	50526	50527	the Englishman	1857	" and therefore nothing surer . You know the old proverb ' Everything in turn , except scandal , whose turn is always . ' And again another saying of our own land ' The second side of the bread takes less time to toast . ' We must not let the first side of ours be toasted ; we will shun all the fire of suspicion . And to do this , you must not be seen , my dear friend . I may go abroad freely ; you must hide your gallant head until matters are ripe for action . You know that you may trust me not to keep you in the dark a day longer than is needful . I have got the old shopkeeper under my thumb , and can do what I please with his trading - ship . But before I place you in command I must change some more of the crew , and do it warily . There is an obstinate Cornishman to get rid of , who sticks to the planks like a limpet . If we throw him overboard , we shall alarm the others ; if we discharge him without showing cause , he will go to the old Admiral and tell all his suspicions . He must be got rid of in London with skill , and then we ship three or four Americans , first - rate seamen , afraid of nothing , who will pass here as fellows from Lancashire . After that we may run among the cruisers as we like , with the boldness and skill of a certain Captain Charron , who must be ill in his cabin when his ship is boarded . "
50823	50874	50313	50313	he	1852	" It is famous , it is very good , my friend . The patience I will have , and the obedience , and the courage ; and so much the more readily because my pay is good , and keeps itself going on dry land as well as sea . "
51034	51139	51024	51024	he	408	" By order of His Majesty King George III . To - morrow being Wednesday , and the fishing - boats at sea , Artillery practice from Fox - hill fort will be carried on from twelve at noon until three P.M. at a mark - boat moored half a mile from the shore . Therefore His Majesty 's loyal subjects are warned to avoid the beach westward of the brook between the white flagstaffs , as well as the sea in front of it , and not to cross the line of fire below the village but at their own risk and peril . "
51153	51416	51141	51143	ADAM JACKSON STUBBARD	394	" Some indignation was aroused by this ; for Mrs. Caper junior who was Mrs. Prater 's cousin had been confined , out of proper calculation , and for the very first time , the moment the boats were gone on Monday ; and her house , being nearest to the fort , and in a hollow where the noise would be certain to keep going round and round , the effect upon her head , not to mention the dear baby 's , was more than any one dared to think of , with the poor father so far away . And if Squire Darling had only been at home , not a woman who could walk would have thought twice about it , but gone all together to insist upon it that he should stop this wicked bombardment . And this was most unselfish of all of them , they were sure , because they had so long looked forward to putting cotton - wool in their ears , and seeing how all the enemies of England would be demolished . But Mrs. Caper junior , and Caper , natu minimus , fell fast asleep together , as things turned out , and heard not a single bang of it . And so it turned out , in another line of life , with things against all calculation , resenting to be reckoned as they always do , like the countless children of Israel . For Admiral Darling was gone far away inspecting , leaving his daughters to inspect themselves . "
51429	51439	51423	51423	you	1865	" said Miss Dolly Darling to her sister Faith ; "
51547	51548	51533	51533	he	345	" "
51562	51573	51574	51574	His	345	" replied Faith , who was very clear - headed . "

51835	51844	51828	51828	I	0	" answered Faith , who understood her sister . "

51913	51914	51922	51922	I	0	" "

51955	51965	51966	51966	you	1878	" cried Dolly , and it was almost crying ; "
52051	52052	52043	52043	I	0	" "
52069	52105	52043	52043	I	0	" and Dolly who dearly loved her sister at the keenest height of rebellion ran up and kissed Faith , with a smile for her , and a tear for her own self - sacrifice . "
52115	52119	52106	52106	I	0	" she said , "
52133	52156	52121	52121	they	944	" The dress of the ladies of the present passing period had been largely affected by the recent peace , which allowed the "
52159	52183	52049	52049	Faith	297	" as the milliners ' dolls were called to come in as quickly as they were conceived . In war time scores of these "
52187	52373	52375	52375	you	1894	" as the rough tars called them were tossed overboard from captured vessels or set up as a mark for tobacco - juice , while sweet eyes in London wept for want of them . And even Mr. Cheeseman had failed to bring any type genuinely French from the wholesale house in St. Mary 's Axe , which was famed for canonical issue . But blessed are the patient , if their patience lasts long enough . The ladies of England were now in full enjoyment of all the new French discoveries , which proved to be the right name , inasmuch as they banished all reputable forms of covering . At least , so Mrs. Twemlow said ; and the Rector went further than she did , obtaining for his sympathy a recommendation to attend to his own business . But when he showed the Admiral his wife 's last book of patterns from a drawer which he had no right to go to great laughter was held between the twain , with some glancing over shoulders , and much dread of bad example . "
52397	52416	52417	52417	Faith	297	" said the Admiral , after a pinch of snuff to restore the true balance of his principles ; "
52452	52453	52446	52446	she	6629	" "
52457	52852	52454	52455	Tonnish females	1898	" as the magazine of fashion called the higher class of popinjays , would have stared with contempt at both Faith and Dolly Darling in their simple walking - dress that day . Dowdies would have been the name for them , or frumps , or frights , or country gawks , because their attire was not statuesque or classic , as it should have been , which means that they were not half naked . Faith , the eldest sister , had meant to let young Dolly take the course of her own stubbornness ; but no sooner did she see her go forth alone than she threw on cloak and hat , and followed . The day was unsuited for classic apparel , as English days are apt to be , and a lady of fashion would have looked more foolish , and even more indecent , than usual . A brisk and rather crisp east wind had arisen , which had no respect for persons , and even Faith and Dolly in their high - necked country dresses had to handle their tackle warily . Dolly had a good start , and growing much excited with the petulance of the wind and with her own audacity , crossed the mouth of the brook at a very fine pace , with the easterly gusts to second her . She could see the little mark - boat well out in the offing , with a red flag flaring merrily , defying all the efforts of the gunners on the hill to plunge it into the bright dance of the waves . And now and then she heard what she knew to be the rush of a round shot far above her head , and following the sound saw a little silver fountain leap up into the sunshine and skim before the breeze ; then glancing up the hill she saw the gray puff drifting , and presently felt the dull rumble of the air . At the root of the smoke - puffs , once or twice , she descried a stocky figure moving leisurely , and in spite of the distance and huddle of vapour could declare that it was Captain Stubbard . Then a dense mass of smoke was brought down by an eddy of wind , and set her coughing . "
52864	52877	52862	52862	Dolly	318	" cried Faith , who had hurried up and seized her hand ; "
52957	52958	52959	52961	Some old fisherman	1902	" "
52994	53013	52990	52990	he	391	" While Dolly was repeating this assurance , the following words were being exchanged upon the smoky parapet : "
53037	53038	53023	53027	two women on the beach	1904	" "
53099	53100	53081	53081	you	1900	" "
53150	53151	53146	53146	I	0	" "
53157	53187	53146	53146	I	0	" cried a loud , stern voice ; and Dolly obeyed in an instant . But Faith stood calmly , and said to the man who rushed past her , "
53196	53262	53191	53192	the Lord	848	" There was no time to answer . The shell had left off rolling , and sputtered more fiercely as the fuse thickened . The man laid hold of this , and tried to pull it out , but could not , and jumped with both feet on it ; while Faith , who quite expected to be blown to pieces , said to herself , "
53269	53270	53191	53192	the Lord	848	" "
53277	53297	53298	53301	The little artillery man	1911	" said the young man , stooping over it , after treading the last spark into the springy sand . "
53327	53328	53315	53315	They	1915	" "
53334	53344	53329	53329	You	6639	" said Faith , as he was hurrying away , "
53375	53376	53372	53372	I	0	" "
53383	53401	53381	53381	sir	6639	" cried Dolly , running up in hot terror , as soon as the danger was over ; "
53443	53444	53430	53430	He	391	" "
53458	53470	53471	53471	I	0	" said the stranger , with a smile at their excitement , "
53544	53650	53538	53538	you	6673	" The fair daughters of the Admiral had enjoyed enough of warfare to last them till the end of their honeymoon , and they could not reject the entreaty of a man who had risked his life to save them . Trembling and bewildered , they made off at the quickest step permitted by maiden dignity , with one or two kindly turns of neck , to show that he was meant to follow them . But another sulphurous cloud rushed down from the indefatigable Stubbard , and when it had passed them , they looked back vainly for the gentleman who had spoiled his boots .
53686	53692	53694	53694	he	1925	" Frenchified young man overhead , "
53944	53952	53954	53954	Faith	297	" You look well enough , dear , "
53958	54001	53954	53954	Faith	297	" and much better than you deserve to look , after leading me such a dance by your self - will . But one thing must be settled before we go back are we to speak of this matter , or not ? "
54002	54013	54014	54015	Miss Dolly	1943	" How can you ask such a question , Faith ? "
54022	54043	54014	54015	Miss Dolly	1943	" Of course we must rather bite our tongues out , than break the solemn pledges which we have given . "
54058	54068	54070	54074	the simple - hearted sister	1944	" Do n't cry , that 's a darling , "
54076	54152	54070	54074	the simple - hearted sister	1944	" You make the whole world seem so cruel when you cry , because you look so innocent . It shall be as you please , if I can only think it right . But I can not see how we gave a pledge of any sort , considering that we ran away without speaking . The question is have we any right to conceal it , when father has a right to know everything ? "
54153	54163	54165	54165	Dolly	277	" He would be in such a sad passion , "
54176	54197	54165	54165	Dolly	277	" and he never would look again at poor Captain Stubbard , and what would become of all his family ? "
54198	54207	54209	54214	the daughter who inherited those qualities	1945	" Father is a just and conscientious man , "
54216	54233	54209	54214	the daughter who inherited those qualities	1945	" he would not blame Captain Stubbard ; he would blame us , and no others . "
54234	54390	54165	54165	Dolly	277	" Oh , I could not bear to hear you blamed , Faith . I should have to say that it was all my fault . And then how I should catch it , and be punished for a month ! Confined to the grounds for a month at least , and never have a bit of appetite . But I am not thinking of myself , I am quite sure of that . You know that I never do that much . I am thinking of that heroic gentleman , who stamped out the sparks so cleverly . All the time I lay on the sand I watched him , though I expected to be blown to pieces every single moment . Oh ! what a nasty sensation it was ! I expected to find all my hair turned grey . But , thank Heaven , I do n't see a streak in it ! "
54404	54435	54397	54397	she	1946	" If all mine had turned grey , ' twould be no odds to nobody as Captain Zeb says about his income because I am intended for an old maid . "
54470	54496	54456	54456	her	1947	" But for yours there are fifty to weep , Dolly . Especially perhaps this young gentleman , towards whom you feel so much gratitude . "
54497	54598	54397	54397	she	1946	" How unkind you are , Faith ! All the gratitude I owe him is for saving your life . As for myself , I was flat upon the sand , with a heap of sea - weed between me and the thing . If it had gone off , it would have gone over me ; but you chose to stand up , like a stupid . Your life was saved , beyond all doubt , by him ; and the way you acknowledge it is to go and tell his chief enemy that he was there observing him ! "
54599	54605	54606	54606	Faith	297	" Well , I never ! "
54617	54652	54606	54606	Faith	297	" A minute ago you knew nothing of him , and even wondered who he was , and now you know all about his enemies ! I am afraid that you stick at nothing . "
54653	54666	54667	54667	Dolly	277	" I do n't stick thinking , as you do , Miss , "
54684	54912	54914	54914	she	1950	" but things come to me by the light of nature , without a twelvemonth of brown - study . When I said what you remind me of , in such a hurry , it was perfectly true so true that you need have no trouble about it , with all your truth . But since that , a sudden idea flashed across me , the sort of idea that proves itself . Your hero you are in such a hurry to betray can be nobody but the mysterious lodger in Widow Shanks ' dimity - parlour , as she calls it ; and Jenny has told me all she knows about him , which is a great deal less than she ought to know . I meant to have told you , but you are so grand in your lofty contempt of what you call gossip , but which I call good neighbourly intercourse ! You know that he is Mr. Caryl Carne , of course . Everybody knows that , and there the knowledge seems to terminate . Even the Twemlows , his own aunt and uncle , are scarcely ever favoured with his company ; and I , who am always on the beach , or in the village , have never had the honour of beholding him , until until it came to this "
54935	55119	54914	54914	she	1950	" He never goes out , and he never asks questions , any more than he answers them , and he never cares to hear what fish they have caught , or anything else , about anybody . He never eats or drinks , and he never says a word about the flowers they put upon his table ; and what he does all day long nobody knows , except that he has a lot of books with him . Widow Shanks , who has the best right to know all about him , has made up her mind that his head has been turned by the troubles of his family , except for his going without dinner , which no lunatic ever does , according to her knowledge . And he seems to have got ' Butter Cheeseman , ' as they call him , entirely at his beck and call . He leaves his black horse there every morning , and rides home at night to his ancestral ruins . There , now , you know as much as I do . "
55120	55131	55133	55133	Faith	297	" There is mischief at the bottom of all this , "
55135	55222	55133	55133	Faith	297	" in these dangerous times , it must not be neglected . We are bound , as you say , to consider his wishes , after all that he has done for us . But the tale about us will be over the place in a few hours , at the latest . The gunners will have known where their bad shot fell , and perhaps they will have seen us with their glasses . How will it be possible to keep this affair from gossip ? "
55223	55346	54914	54914	she	1950	" They may have seen us , without seeing him at all , on account of the smoke that came afterwards . At any rate , let us say nothing about it until we hear what other people say . The shell will be washed away or buried in the sand , for it fell upon the shingle , and then rolled towards the sea ; and there need be no fuss unless we choose to make it , and so perhaps ruin Captain Stubbard and his family . And his wife has made such pretty things for us . If he knew what he had done , he would go and shoot himself . He is so excessively humane and kind . "
55347	55406	54914	54914	she	1950	" We will not urge his humanity to that extreme . I hate all mystery , as you know well . But about this affair I will say nothing , unless there is cause to do so , at least until father comes back ; and then I shall tell him if it seems to be my duty . "
55407	55453	55133	55133	Faith	297	" It wo n't be your duty , it ca n't be your duty , to get good people into trouble , Faith . I find it my duty to keep out of trouble , and I like to treat others the same as myself . "
55454	55531	54914	54914	she	1950	" You are such a lover of duty , dear Dolly , because everything you like becomes your duty . And now your next duty is to your dinner . Mrs. Twemlow is coming I forgot to tell you as well as Eliza , and Mrs. Stubbard . And if Johnny comes home in time from Harrow , to be Jack among the ladies , we shall hear some wonders , you may be quite sure . "
55532	55775	54914	54914	she	1950	" Oh , I vow , I forgot all about that wicked Johnny . What a blessing that he was not here just now ! It is my black Monday when his holidays begin . Instead of getting steadier , he grows more plaguesome . And the wonder of it is that he would tie your kid shoes ; while he pulls out my jaconet , and sits on my French hat . How I wish he was old enough for his commission ! To - morrow he will be dancing in and out of every cottage , boat , or gun , or rabbit - hole , and nothing shall be hidden from his eyes and ears . Let him come . ' I am accustomed to have all things go awry , ' as somebody says in some tragedy . The only chance is to make him fall in love , deeply in love , with Miss Stubbard . He did it with somebody for his Easter week , and became as harmless as a sucking dove , till he found his nymph eating onions raw with a pocketful of boiled limpets . Maggie Stubbard is too perfect in her style for that . She is twelve years old , and has lots of hair , and eyes as large as oysters . I shall introduce Johnny to - morrow , and hope to keep him melancholy all his holidays . "
55776	55785	55787	55787	Faith	297	" Perhaps it will be for his good , "
55789	55813	55787	55787	Faith	297	" because , without some high ideas , he gets into such dreadful scrapes ; and certainly it will be for our good . "
55900	55913	55915	55916	the Captain	1173	" Ca n't smell powder too young in such days as these , "
55935	55942	55943	55944	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" I should be so frightened , "
56037	56038	56028	56028	you	306	" "
56043	56060	56041	56041	ma'am	6642	" replied Mrs. Stubbard , who was dry of speech , and fit mother of heroes , "
56083	56084	56085	56085	We	1963	" "
56091	56102	56105	56105	they	1962	" Miss Twemlow came to her mother 's relief very sharply "

56150	56174	56140	56140	miss	7003	" Eliza Twemlow coloured , for she was rather quick of temper ; but she did not condescend to pay rudeness in kind . "
56188	56217	56185	56185	I	0	" she answered , with a curve of her graceful neck the Carnes had been celebrated for their necks , which were longer than those of the Darlings ; "
56270	56271	56310	56310	you	7003	" "
56275	56280	56310	56310	you	7003	" cried Mrs. Twemlow ; "
56319	56320	56310	56310	you	7003	" "
56332	56340	56310	56310	you	7003	" Mrs. Stubbard cut short the question ; "
56371	56372	56364	56364	he	1971	" "
56402	56406	56394	56394	I	0	" said Johnny . "
56472	56570	56571	56571	I	0	" With many thanks and compliments such a pretty boy he was the ladies released him gladly ; and then Mrs. Twemlow , having reasons of her own , drew nigh to Mrs. Stubbard with lively interest in her children . At first , she received short answers only ; for the Captain 's wife had drawn more sour juices than sweet uses from adversity . But the wife of the man of peace outflanked the better half of the man of war , drove in her outposts , and secured the key of all her communications . "

Ah ! you should a ' heard what old Keppel on the twenty - seventh day of July it was , in the year of our Lord 1778 . Talk about Nelson ! to my mind old Keppel could have boxed his compass backward . Not but what these men know how to fight quite as well as need be nowadays . Why , if I was aboard of that there frigate , I could n't do much more than she have done . She 'll have one of them , you see if she do n't , though she look to have the worst of it , till you comes to understand . The Leader her name is , of thirty - eight guns , and she 'll lead one of they into Portsmouth , to refit . "

59495	59541	59491	59493	the lobster man	2107	" Strike is the word , and no mistake . And small blame to her either . She hathn't got a sound thread to draw , I do believe . Who is the fool now , Mike ? Though vexed I be to ask it . "

She 's laying her course to board the Frenchman on the weather quarter . With a slant of wind she 'll do it , too , if it only holds two minutes . Whistle on your nails , my boys , for the glory of old England . "
59716	59724	59725	59726	old Mike	425	" That 's what I call judgmatical , "
59736	59858	59725	59726	old Mike	425	" whoever thought of that deserves three epulets , one on each shoulder and one upon his head . Doubt if old Keppel would have thought of that , now . You see , mates , the other Crappo ca n't fire at her without first hitting of her own consort . And better than that ever so much better the tilt of the charge will throw her over on her wounds . Master Muncher hath two great holes ' twixt wind and water on his larboard side , and wo n't they suck the briny , with the weight of our bows upon the starboard beam ? ' Twill take fifty hands to stop leaks , instead of stopping boarders . "
59972	60010	60011	60012	old Mike	425	" She've a doed it , she've a doed it rarely . There 's not a d d froggy left to go to heaven ; or if there be so he 's a ' battened down below , "
60032	60074	60011	60012	old Mike	425	" down comes the blood , froth , and blue blazes , as they call the Republican emrods , and up goes the Union - jack , my hearties . Three cheers ! three cheers ! Again ! again ! again ! "
60135	60148	60150	60154	the old navy - man	2126	" My certy , they had better mind their soundings , though ! "
60173	60283	60150	60154	the old navy - man	2126	" five fathoms is every inch of it where they be now , and the tide making strong , and precious little wind to claw off with . Jem Prater ! Jem Prater ! Oar up , and give signal . Ah , he 's too far off to do any good . In five minutes more they 'll be on the White Pig , where no ship ever got off again . Oh , thank the Lord , mates , thank the Lord , for his mercy endureth forever ! The other froggy is stuck hard and fast , and our lads will just fetch out in time . "
60643	60672	60632	60633	Captain Stubbard	391	" I never knew such bad luck in all my life . The devil has been appointed First Lord of the weather ever since I came to Springhaven . "
60704	60740	60679	60679	he	391	" To think that I should never have seen those beggars , when but for the fog I could have smashed them right and left . Admiral , these things make a Christian an infidel . "
60741	60746	60748	60749	the Admiral	747	" Nonsense , sir ! "
60761	60962	60748	60749	the Admiral	747	" you forget that without the fog , or rather the mist for it was only that those fellows would never have come within range . We have very great blessings to be thankful for , though the credit falls not to our battery . The Frenchmen fought wonderfully well , as well as the best Englishman could have done , and to capture them both is a miracle of luck , if indeed we can manage to secure them . My friend , young Honyman , of the Leda , has proved himself just what I said he would be ; and has performed a very gallant exploit , though I fear he is severely wounded . But we shall know more now , for I see a young fellow jumping up the hill , like a kangaroo , and probably he comes for orders . One thing we have learned , Stubbard , and must take the hint to - morrow put a hut on the Haven head , and keep a watchman there . Why , bless my heart , it is Blyth Scudamore that 's coming ! There is nobody else that can skip like that . "
61002	61009	61010	61010	he	2153	" This for you , sir , "
61026	61037	61010	61010	he	2153	" and I am to wait your convenience for reply . "
61038	61047	61049	61053	the Admiral of Captain Stubbard	2157	" What next will the service come to , "
61055	61124	61049	61053	the Admiral of Captain Stubbard	2157	" when a young man just commissioned gives himself such mighty airs ? Shake hands , Blyth , and promise you will come and dine with us , unless you are ordered to return on board at once . How is your good captain ? I knew him when he wore Nankins . Jem Prater brought word that he was wounded . I hope it is not serious . "
61125	61243	61049	61053	the Admiral of Captain Stubbard	2157	" No , sir ; not much to speak of . He has only lost three fingers . That was why I wrote this letter or report , I ought to call it , if anybody else had written it . Oh , sir ! I can not bear to think of it ! I was fifth luff when the fight began , and now there is only one left above me , and he is in command of our biggest prize , the Ville d'Anvers . But , Admiral , here you will find it all , as I wrote it , from the lips , when they tied up the fingers , of Captain Honyman . "
61244	61256	61257	61258	Captain Stubbard	391	" How could you tie them up when they were gone ? "
61295	61336	61269	61269	He	391	" Why , you are the luckiest lad I ever saw ! Sure to go up at least three steps . How well you must have kept out of it ! And how happy you must feel , Lieutenant Scudamore ! "
61337	61349	61350	61352	the young man	861	" I am not at all happy at losing dear friends , "
61379	61390	61358	61358	he	861	" that feeling comes later in life , I suppose . "
61606	61613	61614	61614	he	747	" Why ! why ! why ! "
61630	61706	61614	61614	he	747	" What 's this ? what 's this ? Something on the other side , in a different man 's handwriting , and mighty difficult to read , in my opinion . Stubbard , did you ever see such a scrawl ? Make it out for me . You have good eyes , like a hawk , or the man who saw through a milestone . Scudamore , what was his name ? You know . "
61707	61722	61723	61724	Captain Stubbard	391	" Three fingers at five pounds apiece per annum as long as he lives ! "
61730	61764	61727	61727	his	391	" fifteen pounds a year perhaps for forty years , as you seem to say how young he is ; that comes to just 600 pounds , and his hand as good as ever "
61765	61779	61780	61781	the Admiral	747	" I 'll be hanged if it is , if he wrote this ! "
61783	61885	61780	61781	the Admiral	747	" and better , I must say , from a selfish point of view , because of only two nails left to clean , and his other hand increased in value ; why , the scale is disgraceful , iniquitous , boobyish , and made without any knowledge of the human frame , and the comparative value of its members . Lieutenant Scudamore , look at me . Here you see me without an ear , damaged in the fore - hatch , and with the larboard bow stove in and how much do I get , though so much older ? "
61886	61898	61900	61901	the Admiral	747	" Well , if you wo n't help me , Stubbard , "
61916	61950	61900	61901	the Admiral	747	" I must even get Scudamore to read it , though it seems to have been written on purpose to elude him . Blyth , my dear boy , can you explain it ? "
61951	61960	61961	61962	the lieutenant	2172	" It was it was only something , sir "
61972	62103	61780	61781	the Admiral	747	" which I asked Captain Honyman to leave out , because because it had nothing to do with it . I mean , because it was of no importance , even if he happened to have that opinion . His hand was tied up so , that I did not like to say too much , and I thought that he would go to sleep , because the doctor had made him drink a poppy head boiled down with pigtail . But it seems as if he had got up after that for he always will have his own way while I was gone to put this coat on ; and perhaps he wrote that with his left hand , sir . But it is no part of the business . "
62104	62111	62113	62114	Admiral Darling	332	" Then we will leave it , "
62116	62214	62113	62114	Admiral Darling	332	" for younger eyes than mine to read . Nelson wrote better with his left hand than ever he did with his right , to my thinking , the very first time that he tried it . But we ca n't expect everybody to do that . There is no sign of any change of weather , is there , Stubbard ? My orders will depend very much upon that . I must go home and look at the quicksilver before I know what is best to do . You had better come with me , Scudamore . "
62321	62330	62332	62333	Admiral Darling	332	" Your captain refers to me for orders , "
62345	62590	62332	62333	Admiral Darling	332	" as Commander of the Coast Defence , because he has been brought too far inshore , and one of the Frenchmen is stranded . The frigate you boarded and carried is the Ville d'Anvers , of forty guns . The corvette that took the ground , so luckily for you , when half of your hands were aboard the prize , is the Blonde , teak - built , and only launched last year . We must try to have her , whatever happens . She wo n't hurt where she is , unless it comes on to blow . Our sands hold fast without nipping , as you know , like a well - bred sheep - dog , and the White Pig is the toughest of all of them . She may stay there till the equinox , without much mischief , if the present light airs continue . But the worst job will be with the prisoners ; they are the plague of all these affairs , and we ca n't imitate Boney by poisoning them . On the whole , it had better not have happened , perhaps . Though you must not tell Honyman that I said so . It was a very gallant action , very skilful , very beautiful ; and I hope he will get a fine lift for it ; and you too , my dear Blyth , for you must have fought well . "
62591	62633	62332	62333	Admiral Darling	332	" But , Admiral , surely you would have been grieved if so many of your tenants , and their boats as well , had been swept away into a French harbour . What would Springhaven be without its Captain Zebedee ? "
62634	62844	62332	62333	Admiral Darling	332	" You are right , Blyth ; I forgot that for the moment . There would have been weeping and wailing indeed , even in our own household . But they could not have kept them long , though the loss of their boats would have been most terrible . But I can not make out why the French should have wanted to catch a few harmless fishing - smacks . Aquila non captat muscas , as you taught the boys at Stonnington . And two ships despatched upon a paltry job of that sort ! Either Captain Honyman was strangely misinformed , or there is something in the background , entirely beyond our knowledge . Pay attention to this matter , and let me know what you hear of it as a friend , Blyth , as a friend , I mean . But here we are ! You must want feeding . Mrs. Cloam will take care of you , and find all that is needful for a warrior 's cleanup . I must look at the barometer , and consider my despatches . Let us have dinner , Mrs. Cloam , in twenty minutes , if possible . For we stand in real need of it . "
63166	63178	63180	63181	Admiral Darling	332	" I shall scarcely have time for a bit of dinner , "
63188	63339	63180	63181	Admiral Darling	332	" I have sent word to have the Protector launched , and to give little Billy a feed of corn . All you young people may take your leisure . Youth is the time that commands time and space . But for my part , if I can only manage this plate of soup , and a slice of that fish , and then one help of mutton , and just an apple - fritter , or some trifle of that sort , I shall be quite as lucky as I can hope to be . Duty perpetually spoils my dinner , and I must get some clever fellow to invent a plate that will keep as hot as duty is in these volcanic times . But I never complain ; I am so used to it . Eat your dinners , children , and do n't think of mine . "
63550	63570	63571	63572	the Admiral	747	" Her condition was very bad , as bad as could be , without going straight to the bottom , "
63587	63734	63571	63572	the Admiral	747	" and to the bottom she must have gone , if the sea had got up , before we thrummed her . Honyman wanted to have her brought inside the Head ; but even if we could have got there , she would ground at low water and fill with the tide . And what could we do with all those prisoners ? With our fresh hands at the pumps , we very soon fetched the water out of her , and made her as tight as we could ; and I think they will manage to take her to Portsmouth . She has beautiful lines . I never saw a smarter ship . How she came to the wind , with all that water in her ! The wind is all right for Portsmouth , and she will be a fine addition to the Navy . "
63735	63843	63571	63572	the Admiral	747	" But what is become of the other vessel , craft , corvette , or whatever you call her ? You say that she is scarcely hurt at all . And if she gets off the White Pig 's back in the night , she may come up and bombard us . Not that I am afraid ; but my wife is nervous , and the Rectory faces the sea so much . If you have ordered away the Leda , which seems to have conquered both of them , the least you can do is to keep Captain Stubbard under arms all night in his battery . "
63844	64036	63571	63572	the Admiral	747	" I have a great mind to do so ; it would be a good idea , for he was very much inclined to cut up rough to - day . But he never would forgive me , he is such a hog at hammock as we used to say , until we grew too elegant . And he knows that the Blonde has hauled down her colours , and Scudamore is now prize - captain . I have sent away most of her crew in the Leda , and I am not at all sure that we ought not to blow her up . In the end , we shall have to do so , no doubt ; for nothing larger than a smack has ever got off that sand , and floated . But let our young friend try ; let him have a fair trial . He has the stuff of a very fine seaman in him . And if he should succeed , it would be scored with a long leg for him . Halloa ! Why , I thought the girls were fast asleep long ago ! "
64037	64052	64053	64053	Dolly	277	" As if we could sleep , papa , with this upon our minds ! "
64067	64207	64053	64053	Dolly	277	" Perhaps Faith might , but I am sure I never could . You defied us to make out this , which is on the other leaf ; and then , without giving us fair play , you took it to the desk in your Oak - room , and there you left it . Well , I took the liberty of going there for it , for there ca n't be any secret about a thing that will be printed ; and how are they to print it , if they ca n't contrive to read it ? How much will you pay me for interpreting , papa ? Mr. Twemlow , I think I ought to have a guinea . Can you read it , now , with all your learning , and knowledge of dead languages ? "
64208	64262	63571	63572	the Admiral	747	" My dear , it is not my duty to read it , and not at all my business . It seems to be written with the end of a stick , by a boy who was learning his letters . If you can interpret it , you must be almost a Daniel . "
64263	64349	64053	64053	Dolly	277	" Do you hear that , papa , you who think I am so stupid ? Faith gave it up ; she has no perseverance , or perhaps no curiosity . And I was very nearly beaten too , till a very fine idea came into my head , and I have made out every word except three , and perhaps even those three , if Captain Honyman is not very particular in his spelling . Can you tell me anything about that , papa ? "
64350	64429	64053	64053	Dolly	277	" Yes , Dolly , just what you have heard from me before . Honyman is a good officer ; a very good one , as he has just proved . No good officer ever spells well , whether in the army or the navy . Look at Nelson 's letters . I am inclined to ascribe my own slow promotion to the unnatural accuracy of my spelling , which offended my lords , because it puzzled them . "
64430	64542	64544	64544	We	2212	" Then all is straight sailing , as you say , papa . But I must tell you first how I found it out , or perhaps you wo n't believe me . I knew that Captain Honyman wrote this postscript , or whatever it is , with his left hand , so I took a pen in my own left hand , and practised all the letters , and the way they join , which is quite different from the other hand . And here is the copy of the words , as my left hand taught my right to put them down , after inking ever so many fingers : "
64643	64644	64645	64646	Robert Honyman	436	" "
64650	64658	64663	64663	he	429	" cried the Admiral , with delight . "
64847	64848	64837	64837	Dolly	277	" "
64853	64867	64837	64837	Dolly	277	" said the Rector , drawing near , and filling another deliberative pipe , "
64949	64950	64958	64958	I	0	" "
64964	64970	64958	64958	I	0	" the Admiral hated mystery . "
65328	65329	65330	65330	I	0	" "
65338	65352	65330	65330	I	0	" said Mr. Twemlow , as if it were a question of theology ; "
65480	65481	65459	65460	the Romans	2260	" "
65488	65503	65504	65504	you	299	" said the Admiral , with a smile which smoothed the breach of interruption , "
65594	65595	65600	65601	the Lord	848	" "
65608	65618	65600	65601	the Lord	848	" said the Rector , knocking his pipe out ; "
65662	65671	65640	65643	so many gallant strangers	2264	" But the Admiral laughed , and said , "
65676	66236	65640	65643	so many gallant strangers	2264	" for he had faith in the maids of Springhaven . For these there was a fine time now in store young men up and down everywhere , people running in and out with some new news , before they could get their hats on , the kettle to boil half a dozen times a day , and almost as much to see as they could talk of . At every high - water that came by daylight and sometimes there were two of them every maid in the parish was bound to run to the top of a sand - hill high enough to see over the neck of the Head , and there to be up among the rushes all together , and repulse disdainfully the society of lads . These took the matter in a very different light , and thought it quite a pity and a piece of fickle - mindedness , that they might go the round of crab - pots , or of inshore lug - lines , without anybody to watch them off , or come down with a basket to meet them . For be it understood that the great fishing fleet had not launched forth upon its labours . Their narrow escape from the two French cruisers would last them a long time to think over , and to say the same thing to each other about it that each other had said to them every time they met . And they knew that they could not do this so well as to make a new credit of it every time , when once they were in the same craft together , and could not go asunder more than ten yards and a half . And better , far better , than all these reasons for staying at home and enjoying themselves , was the great fact that they could make more money by leisure than by labour , in this nobly golden time . Luck fostered skill in this great affair , which deserves to be recorded for the good of any village gifted with like opportunity . It appears that the British Admiralty had long been eager for the capture of the Blonde , because of her speed and strength and beauty , and the mischief she had done to English trade . To destroy her would be a great comfort , but to employ her aright would be glorious ; and her proper employment was to serve as a model for English frigates first , and then to fight against her native land . Therefore , no sooner did their lordships hear what had happened at Springhaven than they sent down a rider express , to say that the ship must be saved at any price . And as nothing could be spared from the blockading force , or the fleet in the Downs , or the cruising squadron , the Commander of the coast - defence was instructed to enrol , impress , or adapt somehow all the men and the matter available . Something was said about free use of money in the service of His Majesty , but not a penny was sent to begin upon . But Admiral Darling carried out his orders , as if he had received them framed in gold . "
66248	66252	66255	66255	they	2267	" he said ; "
66308	66488	66289	66289	Scudamore	429	" The fleet under Captain Tugwell had quite lately fallen off from seven to five , through the fierce patriotism of some younger members , and their sanguine belief in bounty - money . Captain Zeb had presented them with his experience in a long harangue nearly fifty words long and they looked as if they were convinced by it . However , in the morning they were gone , having mostly had tiffs with their sweethearts which are fervent incentives to patriotism and they chartered themselves , and their boats were numbered for the service of their Country . They had done their work well , because they had none to do , except to draw small wages , and they found themselves qualified now for more money , and came home at the earliest chance of it . Two guineas a day for each smack and four hands , were the terms offered by the Admiral , whose hard - working conscience was twitched into herring - bones by the strife between native land and native spot . "
66498	66508	66489	66489	I	0	" he told Dolly , going down one evening , "
66606	66748	66749	66749	I	0	" But by doing his best , he got over the hardship , as people generally do . He settled the daily wages as above , with a bonus of double that amount for the day that saw the Blonde upon her legs again . Indignation prevailed , or pretended to do so ; but common - sense conquered , and all set to work . Hawsers , and chains , and buoys , and all other needful gear and tackle were provided by the Admiralty from the store - house built not long ago for the Fencibles . And Zebedee Tugwell , by right of position , and without a word said for it because who could say a word against it ? became the commander of the Rescue fleet , and drew double pay naturally for himself and family . "
66753	66757	66749	66749	I	0	" he said , "
66882	66882	66878	66878	I	0	"
66975	66980	66982	66983	Captain Zeb	337	" Rain afore Friday , "
66985	67007	66982	66983	Captain Zeb	337	" and a blow from sowwest afore Sunday . ' Twill break up the Blunder , I reckon , my lads . "
67440	67445	67447	67447	Zeb	337	" Nobody in there ? "
67459	67485	67447	67447	Zeb	337	" then sit down on this bit of bank , sir , a minute . Less chance to be shot at by any French ship . "
67541	67579	67528	67528	Tugwell	337	" How much will Government pay the chaps as fetches her out of that snug little berth ? For division to self and partners , how much ? For division to self and family , how much ? "
67580	67587	67588	67589	the lieutenant	2172	" I have thought about that , "
67608	67638	67588	67589	the lieutenant	2172	" and I think it would be very unsafe to count upon getting a penny beyond the Admiral 's terms double pay for the day that we float her . "
67663	67670	67671	67671	he	278	" Ca n't a'most believe it , "
67684	67704	67671	67671	he	278	" the English country , as I belongs to , ca n't quite ' a coom to that yet ! "
67705	67713	67714	67714	Blyth	429	" I fear that it has indeed , "
67720	67819	67714	67714	Blyth	429	" at least I am sure of this , Master Tugwell , that you must not look forward to any bounty , bonus , or premium , or whatever it is called , from the Authorities who should provide it . But for myself , and the difference it will make to me whether we succeed or fail , I shall be happy , and will give my word , to send you 50 pounds , to be divided at your discretion among the smacks . I mean , of course , as soon as I get paid . "
67861	67867	67845	67845	he	429	" Never fear , lad , "
67883	68031	67845	67845	he	429	" we 'll not take a farden of thy hard airnings , not a brass farden , so help me Bob ! Gentlefolks has so much call for money , as none of us know nothing of . And thou hast helped to save all the lot of us from Frenchies , and been the most forwardest , as I hear tell . But if us could ' a got 50 pounds out of Government , why so much more for us , and none the less for they . But a Englishman must do his duty , in reason , and when ' a do n't hurt his self by the same . There 's a change in the weather , as forbids more sport . You shall have the Blunder off to - morrow , lad . Would n't do to be too sudden like . "
68032	68064	68065	68065	Zebedee	278	" I fear I am very stupid , Master Tugwell . But I do n't see how you can manage it so surely , after labouring nine days all in vain . "
68088	68215	68080	68081	the latter	1655	" I trust in your honour , sir , of course , to keep me clear . I might have brought ' e off the Pig , first day , or second to the latest , if it were sound business . But with winter time coming , and the week 's fishing lost , our duty to our families and this place was to pull ' e on harder , sir , to pull ' e aground firmer ; and with the help of the Lord we have a - doed it well . We was n't a - going to kill the goose as laid the golden eggs . No offence to you , sir ; it was n't you as was the goose . "
68247	68259	68261	68261	Scudamore	429	" I can understand how you could do such a thing , "
68279	68343	68261	68261	Scudamore	429	" but I can not understand by what power on earth you are enabled to look at me and tell me this . For nine days you have been paid every night , and paid pretty well , as you yourself acknowledge , to haul a ship off a shoal ; and all the time you have been hauling her harder upon it ! "
68344	68348	68350	68350	Tugwell	288	" Young man , "
68356	68403	68350	68350	Tugwell	288	" a hofficer should be above such words . But I forgive ' e , and hope the Lord will do the same , with allowance for youth and ill - convenience . I might ' a knowed no better , at your age and training . "
68404	68450	68261	68261	Scudamore	429	" But what were you paid for , just answer me that , unless it was to pull the Blonde off the sand - bank ? And how can you pretend that you have done an honest thing by pulling her further upon the bank ? "
68451	68482	68350	68350	Tugwell	288	" I wo n't ask ' e , sir , to beg my pardon for saying what never man said to me , without reading the words of the contraction ; "
68504	68570	68581	68581	Scuddy	328	" this contraction was signed by yourself and Squire Darling , for and on behalf of the kingdom ; and the words are for us to give our services , to pull , haul , tow , warp , or otherwise as directed , release , relieve , set free , and rescue the aforesaid ship , or bark , or vessel , craft , or "
68571	68579	68581	68581	Scuddy	328	" Please not to read all that , "
68583	68620	68581	68581	Scuddy	328	" or a gale of wind may come before you are half - way through . It was Admiral Darling 's lawyer , Mr. Furkettle , who prepared it , to prevent any chance of misunderstanding . "
68621	68625	68627	68627	Tugwell	337	" Provided always , "
68631	68688	68627	68627	Tugwell	337	" and the meaning , condition , purport , object , sense , and intention of this agreement is , that the aforesaid Zebedee Tugwell shall submit in everything to the orders , commands , instructions , counsel , directions , injunctions , authority , or discretion , whether in writing or otherwise , of the aforesaid "
68689	68700	68581	68581	Scuddy	328	" I would not interrupt you if I could help it "
68761	68786	68750	68750	himself	278	" But excuse me for saying that I know all these conditions ; and the tide will be lost , if we stop here . "
68787	68904	69240	69240	Tugwell	288	" Very good , sir ; then you see how it standeth . Who hath broken them ? Not us ! We was paid for to haul ; and haul we did , according to superior orders . She grounded from the south , with the tide making upp'ard , somewhere about three - quarter flow ; and the Squire , and you , and all the rest of ' e , without no knowledge of the Pig whatsomever , fastens all your pulley - haulies by the starn , and says , ' now pull ! ' And pull we did , to the tune of sixteen guineas a day for the good of Springhaven . "
68905	68986	68750	68750	himself	278	" And you knew all the time that it was wrong ! Well , I never came across such people . But surely some one of you would have had the honesty I beg pardon , I mean the good - will to tell us . I can scarcely imagine some forty men and boys preserving such a secret for nine whole days , hauling for their lives in the wrong direction , and never even by a wink or smile "
68987	68993	68995	68996	Master Tugwell	288	" Springhaven is like that , "
69000	69201	68995	68996	Master Tugwell	288	" we does a thing one and all together , even if us reasons consarning it . And over and above that , sir , there is but two men in Springhaven as understands the White Pig , barring my own self . The young ' uns might ' a smelt a rat , but they knew better than to say so . Where the Blunder grounded and she hath airned her name , for the good of the dwellers in this village is the chine of the Pig ; and he hath a double back , with the outer side higher than the inner one . She came through a narrow nick in his outer back , and then plumped , stem on , upon the inner one . You may haul at her forever by the starn , and there she 'll ' bide , or lay up again on the other back . But bring her weight forrard , and tackle her by the head , and off she comes , the very next fair tide ; for she hath berthed herself over the biggest of it , and there bain't but a basketful under her forefoot . "
69202	69227	69228	69228	Scudamore	429	" Then , Master Tugwell , let us lose no time , but have at her at once , and be done with it . "
69251	69371	69240	69240	Tugwell	288	" Begging of your pardon , sir , I would invite of you not to be in no sart of hurry hasting forwardly . Us must come off gradual , after holding on so long there , and better to have Squire Darling round the corner first , sir . Not that he knoweth much about it , but ' a might make believe to do so . And when ' a hath seen us pull wrong ways , a hundred and twenty guineas ' worth , a ' might grudge us the reward for pulling right ways . I 've a - knowed ' un get into that state of mind , although it was his own tenants . "
69449	69455	69456	69456	he	747	" I did hear tell , "
69470	69643	69456	69456	he	747	" that the Squire were under compulsion to go a bit westward again to - morrow . And when he cometh back he would be glad to find us had managed the job without him . No fear of the weather breaking up afore Friday , and her ca n't take no harm for a tide or two . If you thinks well , sir , let us heave at her to - day , as afore , by superior orders . Then it come into your mind to try t'other end a bit , and you shift all the guns and heavy lumber forrard to give weight to the bows and lift the starn , and off her will glide at the first tug to - morrow , so sure as my name is Zebedee . But mind one thing , sir , that you keep her , when you 've got her . She hath too many furriner natives aboard of her , to be any way to my liking . "
69644	69655	69657	69657	Blyth	429	" Oh , there need be no doubt about them , "
69659	69703	69657	69657	Blyth	429	" we treat them like ourselves , and they are all upon their honour , which no Frenchman ever thinks of breaking . But my men will be tired of waiting for me . I shall leave you to your plans , Tugwell . "
69704	69717	69718	69719	Captain Zebedee	2323	" Ah , I know the natur ' of they young men , "
69737	69822	69730	69730	Scudamore	429	" they be full of scruples for themselves and faith in other fellows . He 'll never tell Squire , nor no one else here , what I laid him under , and the laugh would go again ' him , if he did . We shall get to - day 's money , I reckon , as well as double pay to - morrow , and airn it . Well , it might ' a been better , and it might be wuss . "
70134	70144	70145	70145	Carne	356	" Then you wish me to conclude , monsieur , "
70152	70184	70145	70145	Carne	356	" that you will not do your duty to your country , in the subject set before you ? I pray you to deliberate , because your position hangs upon it . "
70185	70238	70128	70130	the cold one	2346	" Never ! Never ! Once more , Captain , with all thanks for your consideration , I refuse . My duty to my own honour has first place . After that my duty to my country . Speak of it no more , sir ; it quite is to insult me . "
70239	70306	70145	70145	Carne	356	" No , Captain Desportes , it is nothing of that kind , or I should not be here to propose it . Your parole is given only as long as your ship continues upon the sand . The moment she floats , you are liberated . Then is the time for a noble stroke of fortune . Is it not so , my dear friend ? "
70307	70363	70145	70145	Carne	356	" No , sir . This affair is impossible . My honour has been pledged , not until the ship is floating , but until I am myself set free in France . I am sorry not to see things as you see them for me ; but the question is for my own consideration . "
70516	70522	70523	70523	Carne	356	" There is one consideration , "
70536	70616	70523	70523	Carne	356	" which precedes all others , even that of honour , in the mind of a trusted officer . It is not that of patriotism which has not its usual weight with monsieur but it is that of obedience , discipline , loyalty , faith , towards those who have placed faith in him . Captain Desportes , as commander of a ship , is entrusted with property ; and that confidence is the first debt upon his honour . "
70667	70768	70655	70655	he	446	" How am I to know , monsieur , what would be the wishes of those who have entrusted me with my position ? You are placed in authority by some means here , in your own country , but against it . That much you have proved to me , by papers . But your credentials are general only . They do not apply to this especial case . If the Chief of the State knew my position , he would wish me to act as I mean to act , for the honour and credit of our nation . "
70769	70796	70797	70797	Carne	356	" Are you then acquainted with his signature ? If so , perhaps you will verify this , even if you are resolved to reject it . "
70839	70849	70850	70850	he	356	" There is nothing in this that concerns you , "
70863	70894	70850	70850	he	356	" except these few words at the end , which perhaps you may like to read , before you make final decision . The signature of the Chief is clear . "
70899	71046	70895	70896	Captain Desportes	446	" It is of the utmost importance to me , that the Blonde should not be captured by the enemy , as the Ville d'Anvers has been . You tell me that it is ashore near you , and the Captain and crew upon parole , to be liberated if they assist in the extrication of the vessel . This must not be . In the service of the State , I demand that they consider not at all their parole . The well - known speed and light draught of that vessel have rendered her almost indispensable to me . When the vessel is free , they must rise upon the enemy , and make for the nearest of our ports without delay . Upon this I insist , and place confidence in your established courage and management , to accomplish it to my satisfaction . "
71047	71054	71056	71057	Caryl Carne	356	" Your orders are clear enough , "
71059	71077	71056	71057	Caryl Carne	356	" What reason can you give , as an officer of the Republic , for disobeying them ? "
71135	71142	71144	71148	the French sea - captain	2358	" Be in no rash haste , "
71167	71287	71151	71151	he	2358	" I do not recognise in this mandate the voice of my country , of the honourable France , which would never say , ' Let my sons break their word of honour ! ' This man speaks , not as Chief of a grand State , not as leader of noble gentlemen , but as Emperor of a society of serfs . France is no empire ; she is a grand nation of spirit , of valour , above all , of honour . The English have treated me , as I would treat them , with kindness , with largeness , with confidence . In the name of fair France , I will not do this thing . "
71307	71337	71295	71295	he	356	" France will be an empire within six months ; and your honour will be put upon prison diet , while your family starve for the sake of it . "
71338	71348	71350	71352	the brave Frenchman	2360	" If I ever meet you under other circumstances , "
71358	71366	71350	71352	the brave Frenchman	2360	" I shall demand reparation , sir . "
71367	71372	71374	71374	Carne	356	" With great pleasure , "
71378	71392	71374	71374	Carne	356	" meanwhile monsieur will have enough to do to repair his broken fortunes . "
71416	71423	71424	71424	he	446	" To the Blonde , lads , "
71427	71433	71424	71424	he	446	" to the unsullied Blonde ! "
71742	71746	71748	71749	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" My dear , "
71779	72149	71748	71749	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" this will be a great day for my dear husband 's parish . Perhaps there is no other parish in the kingdom capable of acting as Springhaven has , so obedient , so disciplined , so faithful to their contract ! I am told that they even pulled the vessel more aground , in preference to setting up their own opinions . I am told that as soon as the Admiral was gone for between you and me he is a little overbearing , with the very best intentions in the world , but too confident in his own sagacity then that clever but exceedingly modest young man , Lieutenant Scudamore , was allowed at last to listen to our great man Tugwell , who has long been the oracle of the neighbourhood about the sea , and the weather , and all questions of that kind . And between you and me , my dear , the poor old Admiral seems a little bit jealous of his reputation . And what do you think he said before he went , which shows his high opinion of his own abilities ? Tugwell said something in his rough and ready way , which , I suppose , put his mightiness upon the high ropes , for he shouted out in everybody 's hearing , ' I 'll tell you what it is , my man , if you can get her off , by any of your ' something I must not repeat ' devices , I 'll give you fifty guineas , five - and - twenty for yourself , and the rest to be divided among these other fellows . ' Then Zebedee pulled out a Testament from his pocket , for he is a man of deep religious convictions , and can read almost all the easy places , though he thinks most of the hard ones , and he made his son Dan who is a great scholar , as they say , and a very fine - looking youth as well put down at the end what the Admiral had said . Now , what do you think of that , dear Mrs. Stubbard ? "
72150	72154	72156	72160	that strong - minded lady	2384	" I think , "
72162	72189	72156	72160	that strong - minded lady	2384	" that Tugwell is an arrant old fox ; and if he gets the fifty guineas , he will put every farthing into his own pocket . "
72190	72352	71748	71749	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" Oh , no ! He is honest as the day itself . He will take his own twenty - five , and then leave the rest to settle whether he should share in their twenty - five . But we must be quick , or we shall lose the sight . Quite a number of people are come from inland . How wonderfully quickly these things spread ! They came the first day , and then made up their minds that nothing could be done , and so they stopped at home . But now , here they are again , as if by magic ! If the ship gets off , it will be known halfway to London before nightfall . But I see Captain Stubbard going up the hill to your charming battery . That shows implicit faith in Tugwell , to return the salute of the fair captive ! It is indeed a proud day for Springhaven ! "
72353	72430	72156	72160	that strong - minded lady	2384	" But it is n't done yet . And perhaps it wo n't be done . I would rather trust officers of the navy than people who catch crabs and oysters . I would go up to the battery , to laugh at my husband , but for the tricks the children play me . My authority is gone , at the very first puff of smoke . How children do delight in that vile gunpowder ! "
72431	72469	72156	72160	that strong - minded lady	2384	" So they ought , in the present state of our country , with five hundred thousand of Frenchmen coming . My dear Mrs. Stubbard , how thankful we should be to have children who love gunpowder ! "
72470	72482	71748	71749	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" But not when they blow up their mother , ma'am . "
72483	72490	72492	72493	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" Oh , here comes Eliza ! "
72495	72542	72492	72493	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" I am so glad , because she knows everything . I thought we had missed her . My dear child , where are Faith and Dolly Darling gone ? There are so many strangers about to - day that the better class should keep together . "
72543	72553	72555	72557	the young lady	1315	" Here are three of us at any rate , "
72567	72642	72555	72557	the young lady	1315	" enough to secure one another 's sanctity from the lower orders . Faith has gone on to the headland , with that heroic mannikin , Johnny . Dolly was to follow , with that Shanks maid to protect her , as soon as her hat was trimmed , or some such era . But I 'll answer for it that she loses herself in the crowd , or some fib of that sort . "
72643	72646	72648	72649	her mother	7258	" Eliza ! "
72661	72757	72656	72657	Mrs. Stubbard	393	" I am quite astonished at your talking so . You might do the greatest injury to a very lively and harmless , but not over - prudent girl , if any one heard you who would repeat it . We all know that the Admiral is so wrapped up in Dolly that he lets her do many things which a mother would forbid . But that is no concern of ours ; and once for all , if such things must be said , I beg that they may not be said by you . "
72789	72800	72781	72782	Mrs. Stubbard	393	" Well , time will show whether I deserve it . "
73015	73028	72980	72980	Zebedee	278	" With a will ! with a will , my gay lads ! "
73103	73160	73161	73161	Dolly	277	" If you wish to do me a real service , according to your kind words of Saturday , be in the upper shrubbery at half past eleven ; but tell no one except the bearer . You will see all that happens better there than on the beach , and I will bring a telescope . "
73489	73686	73738	73738	Jenny	311	" to flutter from her wrist , nor hair oiled into flat Lesbian coils , but freedom of rich young tresses , and of graceful figure , and taper limbs . There was no one who could say her nay , of the lovers of maiden nature . However , maidens must be discreet , even when most adventurous ; and so she took another maid to help her , of respected but not romantic name Jenny Shanks , who had brought her that letter . Jenny was much prettier than her name , and the ground she trod on was worshipped by many , even when her shoes were down at heel . Especially in this track remained the finer part of Charley Bowles 's heart while the coarser was up against the Frenchmen , as well as a good deal of Mr. Prater 's nephew 's , and of several other sole - fishers . This enabled Jenny to enter kindly into tender questions . And she fetched her Sunday bonnet down the trap - ladder where she kept it because the other maids were so nasty as soon as her letter was delivered . "
73697	73730	73690	73690	Jenny	311	" Miss Dolly said , with no small dignity , as this zealous attendant kept step for step with her , and swung her red arm against the lady 's fair one . "
73755	73756	73766	73766	your	311	" "
73789	73790	73781	73781	you	311	" "
73822	73823	73819	73819	your	311	" "
73876	74233	74234	74234	Jenny	311	" Dolly looked down at her with vast contempt , which she would not lower herself by expressing , even with favour of time and place . Then turning a corner of the grassy walk , between ground - ash and young larches , they came upon an opening planted round with ilex , arbutus , juniper , and laurel , and backed by one of the rocks which form the outworks of the valley . From a niche in this rock , like the port - hole of a ship , a rill of sparkling water poured , and beginning to make a noise already , cut corner 's of its own production short , in its hurry to be a brook , and then to help the sea . And across its exit from the rock like a measure of its insignificance a very comfortable seat was fixed , so that any gentleman or even a lady with divided skirts might freely sit with one foot on either bank of this menacing but not yet very formidable stream . So that on the whole this nook of shelter under the coronet of rock was a favourite place for a sage cock - pheasant , or even a woodcock in wintry weather . Upon that bench where the Admiral loved to sit , in the afternoon of peace and leisure , observing with a spy - glass the manoeuvres of his tranquil fishing fleet Caryl Carne was sitting now , with his long and strong legs well spread out , his shoulders comfortably settled back , and his head cast a little on one side , as if he were trying to compute his property . Then , as Dolly came into the opening , he arose , made a bow beyond the compass of any true Briton , and swinging his hat , came to meet her . Dolly made a curtsey in the style impressed upon her by her last governess but one a French lady of exceedingly high ancestry and manners and Carne recognised it as a fine thing out of date . "
74239	74258	74234	74234	Jenny	311	" said Dolly words not meant for him to hear , but he had grave command of countenance . "
74267	74299	74234	74234	Jenny	311	" Carne spoke in a low voice , and with a smile of diffidence which reminded her of Scudamore , though the two smiles were as different as night and day . "
74373	74374	74375	74376	No one	6581	" "
74383	74400	74375	74376	No one	6581	" she answered , looking up at him bravely , and yet frightened by his gaze , "
74433	74434	74440	74446	Who would not rush to do so	2415	" "
74520	74521	74504	74509	the people that do the wrong	2423	" "
74554	74595	74551	74552	Lord Nelson	276	" This young man nourished a large contempt for the intellect of women , and was therefore surprised at the quickness and spirit of the girl whom he wished to terrify . A sterner tone must be used with her . "
74602	74617	74551	74552	Lord Nelson	276	" he said , with a smile of sad sympathy for those who do ; "
74641	74688	74631	74631	I	0	" Miss Dolly , the pet child of the house , and all the people round it except the gardener , Mr. Swipes , who found her too inquisitive quick as she was , could not realise at once the possibility of being looked down upon . "
74700	74704	74693	74693	you	0	" she said , "
74785	74852	74758	74758	you	0	" With all her many faults many more than she dreamed of fair Dolly had a warm and gentle heart , which filled her eyes with tender loveliness , whenever it obtained command of them . Carne , who was watching them steadfastly for his own purpose , forgot that purpose , and dropped his dark eyes , and lost the way to tell a lie . "
74859	74877	74854	74854	I	0	" he said , almost stammering , and longing without knowledge for the blessing of her touch , "
74945	75047	75048	75048	You	0	" Dolly blushed at the rich tone in which he pronounced her name , almost as if it were an adjective ; but she allowed him to take her hand , and lead her to the bench beneath the rock . Then , regardless of his breeches , although of fine padusoy , and his coat , though of purple velvet , he sate down on the bank of the rill at her feet , and waited for her to say something . The young lady loved mainly to take the lead , but would liefer have followed suit just now . "
75055	75183	75048	75048	You	0	" she said , very softly , and with an unusual timidity , which added to her face and manner almost the only charm they lacked , ' some things which I do not understand , and which I have no right to ask you of , except for your own offer . Why should you , without injuring any one , but only having suffered loss of all your family property , and of all your rights and comforts , and living in that lonely place which used to be full of company why should you be in danger now , when you have nothing more to be robbed of ? I beg your pardon I mean when all your enemies must have done their worst . "
75184	75195	75196	75196	he	2432	" You are too young yet to understand the world , "
75206	75283	75196	75196	he	2432	" and I hope most truly that you may never do so . In your gentle presence I can not speak with bitterness , even if I could feel it . I will not speak harshly of any one , however I may have been treated . But you will understand that my life alone remains betwixt the plunderers and their prey , and that my errand here prevents them from legally swallowing up the spoil . "
75328	75334	75335	75335	she	277	" Oh , I see ! "
75345	75383	75335	75335	she	277	" I can quite understand a thing like that , from what I have heard about witnesses . I hope you will be very careful . My sister owes so much to you , and so do I. "
75384	75480	75632	75632	she	448	" You must never speak of that again , unless you wish to grieve me . I know that I have said too much about myself ; but you alone care to know anything about me ; and that beguiles one out out of one 's wits . If I speak bad English , you will forgive me . I have passed so many years on the Continent , and am picking up the language of my childhood very slowly . You will pardon me , when I am misled by by my own signification . "
75481	75485	75487	75489	the innocent Dolly	448	" Well done ! "
75491	75547	75335	75335	she	277	" Now that is the very first piece of bad English you have used , to the best of my belief , and I am rather quick in that . But you have not yet explained to me my own danger , though you asked me to come here for that purpose , I believe . "
75548	75604	75632	75632	she	448	" But you shall not be so ; you shall not be in danger . My life shall be given for your defence . What imports my peril compared with yours ? I am not of cold blood . I will sacrifice all . Have faith in me purely , and all shall be done . "
75605	75609	75610	75610	Dolly	448	" All what ? "
75644	75684	75632	75632	she	448	" You can not be persuaded that you are in any danger . It is possible that I have been too anxious . Do you speak the French language easily ? Do you comprehend it , when spoken quickly ? "
75685	75738	75632	75632	she	448	" Not a word of it . I have had to learn , of course , and can pronounce very well , my last mistress said ; but I can not make it out at all in the way the French people pronounce it , when one comes to talk with them . "
75739	75878	75632	75632	she	448	" It is very wrong of them , and the loss is theirs . They expect us to copy them even in their language , because we do it in everything else . Pardon me one moment . May I look at the great enterprise which is to glorify Springhaven ? It is more than kind of you to be here instead of there . But this , as I ventured to say , is a far better place to observe the operation . Your words reminded me of Captain Desportes , who has been , I think , your father 's guest . A very gallant sailor , and famed for the most unexpected exploits . Without doubt , he would have captured all three ships , if he had not contrived to run his own aground . "
75879	75978	75632	75632	she	448	" How could he capture his own ship ? I thought that you never dealt in jokes . But if you dislike them , you seem to be fond of a little mystery . I like the French captain very much , and he took the trouble to speak slowly for me . My father says that he bears his misfortune nobly , and like a perfect gentleman . Mr. Scudamore admires him , and they are great friends . And yet , sir , you seem inclined to hint that I am in danger from Captain Desportes ! "
75979	76059	75632	75632	she	448	" Ha ! she is afloat ! They have succeeded . I thought that they had so arranged it . The brave ship spreads her pinions . How clever the people of Springhaven are ! If you will condescend to look through this glass , you will see much embracing of the Saxon and the Gaul , or rather , I should say , of the Saxon by the Gaul . Old Tugwell is not fond to be embraced . "
76060	76073	76075	76075	Dolly	448	" Oh , let me see that ! I must see that ! "
76084	76222	76075	76075	Dolly	448	" to see Capp'en Zeb in the arms of a Frenchman yes , I declare , two have got him , if not three , and he puts his great back against the mast to disentangle it . Oh , what will he do next ? He has knocked down two , in reply to excessive cordiality . What wonderful creatures Frenchmen are ! How kind it is of you to show me this ! But excuse me , Mr. Carne ; there will be twenty people coming to the house before I can get back almost . And the ship will salute the battery , and the battery will return it . Look ! there goes a great puff of smoke already . They can see me up here , when they get to that corner . "
76223	76256	75632	75632	she	448	" But this spot is not private ? I trust that I have not intruded . Your father allows a sort of foot - path through this upper end of his grounds ? "
76257	76322	75632	75632	she	448	" Yes , to all the villagers , and you are almost one of them ; there is no right of way at all ; and they very seldom come this way , because it leads to nowhere . Faith is fond of sitting here , to watch the sea , and think of things . And so am I sometimes , I mean . "

80093	80105	80071	80071	he	861	" Daniel Tugwell , son of Zebedee Tugwell , of Springhaven . "
80296	80312	80313	80314	No ghost	2614	" Who are you , that have dared to come and cut my fence down ? "
80368	80403	80347	80347	He	282	" I am Daniel Tugwell , of Springhaven . And no living man shall deny me of my rights . I have a right to pass here , and I mean to do it . "
80425	80434	80435	80435	he	356	" Are you ready to run against this ? "
80438	80451	80435	80435	he	356	" Poor peasant , go back ; what are your rights worth ? "
80452	80462	80464	80464	Daniel	282	" I could smash that skewer at a blow , "
80475	80513	80464	80464	Daniel	282	" but my rights , as you say , are not worth the hazard . What has a poor man to do with rights ? Would you stop a man of your own rank , Squire Carne ? "
80514	80678	80679	80679	Dan	282	" Ah , that would be a different thing indeed ! Justice wears a sword , because she is of gentle birth . Work - people with axes must not prate of rights , or a prison will be their next one . Your right is to be disdained , young man , because you were not born a gentleman ; and your duty is to receive scorn with your hat off . You like it , probably , because your father did . But come in , Daniel ; I will not deny you of the only right an English peasant has the right of the foot to plod in his father 's footsteps . The right of the hand , and the tongue , and the stomach even the right of the eye is denied him ; but by some freak of law he has some little right of foot , doubtless to enable him to go and serve his master . "
80748	80751	80756	80756	they	2618	" the Club "
80819	80895	80896	80896	Carne	357	" What ! Break down a fence , and then be afraid to enter ! That is the style of your race , friend Daniel . That is why you never get your rights , even when you dare to talk of them . I thought you were made of different stuff . Go home and boast that you shattered my fence , and then feared to come through it , when I asked you . "
80930	80938	80939	80939	he	357	" Then mind one thing , sir , "
80957	80971	80939	80939	he	357	" I pass here , not with your permission , but of right . "
80972	80982	80984	80984	Carne	357	" Very well . Let us not split words , "
80995	81326	80984	80984	Carne	357	" I am glad to find a man that dares to claim his rights , in the present state of England . I am going towards Springhaven . Give me the pleasure of your company , and the benefit of your opinion upon politics . I have heard the highest praise of your abilities , my friend . Speak to me just as you would to one of your brother fishermen . By the accident of birth I am placed differently from you ; and in this country that makes all the difference between a man and a dog , in our value . Though you may be , and probably are , the better man more truthful , more courageous , more generous , more true - hearted , and certain to be the more humble of the two . I have been brought up where all men are equal , and the things I see here make a new world to me . Very likely these are right , and all the rest of the world quite wrong . Englishmen always are certain of that ; and as I belong to the privileged classes , my great desire is to believe it . Only I want to know how the lower orders the dregs , the scum , the dirt under our feet , the slaves that do all the work and get starved for it how these trampled wretches regard the question . If they are happy , submissive , contented , delighted to lick the boots of their betters , my conscience will be clear to accept their homage , and their money for any stick of mine they look at . But you have amazed me by a most outrageous act . Because the lower orders have owned a path here for some centuries , you think it wrong that they should lose their right . Explain to me , Daniel , these extraordinary sentiments . "
81327	81334	81336	81336	Dan	282	" If you please , sir , "
81357	81437	81336	81336	Dan	282	" I can hardly tell you how the lower orders feel , because father and me do n't belong to them . Our family have always owned their own boat , and worked for their own hand , this two hundred years , and , for all we know , ever since the Romans was here . We call them the lower orders , as come round to pick up jobs , and have no settlement in our village . "
81438	81524	80984	80984	Carne	357	" A sound and very excellent distinction , Dan . But as against those who make the laws , and take good care to enforce them , even you though of the upper rank here must be counted of the lower order . For instance , can you look at a pheasant , or a hare , without being put into prison ? Can you dine in the same room with Admiral Darling , or ask how his gout is , without being stared at ? "
81525	81576	81336	81336	Dan	282	" No , sir . He would think it a great impertinence , even if I dared to do such a thing . But my father might do it , as a tenant and old neighbour . Though he never gets the gout , when he rides about so much . "
81577	81740	80984	80984	Carne	357	" What a matter - of - fact youth it is ! But to come to things every man has a right to . If you saved the life of one of the Admiral 's daughters , and she fell in love with you , as young people will , would you dare even lift your eyes to her ? Would you not be kicked out of the house and the parish , if you dared to indulge the right of every honest heart ? Would you dare to look upon her as a human being , of the same order of creation as yourself , who might one day be your wife , if you were true and honest , and helped to break down the absurd distinctions built up by vile tyranny between you ? In a word , are you a man as every man is on the Continent or only an English slave , of the lower classes ? "
81767	81830	81336	81336	Dan	282	" ; while his mind would not come to him to make a fit reply . That his passion for Dolly , his hopeless passion , should thus be discovered by a man of her own rank , but not scorned or ridiculed , only pitied , because of his want of manly spirit ; that he should be called a ' slave "
81935	81947	81949	81949	Carne	356	" You do well to take these things with some doubt , "
81968	82263	81949	81949	Carne	356	" if I were in your place , I should do the same . Centuries of oppression have stamped out the plain light of truth in those who are not allowed it . To me , as an individual , it is better so . Chance has ordained that I should belong to the order of those who profit by it . It is against my interest to speak as I have done . Am I likely to desire that my fences should be broken , my property invaded , the distinction so pleasing to me set aside , simply because I consider it a false one ? No , no , friend Daniel ; it is not for me to move . The present state of things is entirely in my favour . And I never give expression to my sense of right and wrong , unless it is surprised from me by circumstances . Your bold and entirely just proceedings have forced me to explain why I feel no resentment , but rather admiration , at a thing which any other land - owner in England would not rest in his bed until he had avenged . He would drag you before a bench of magistrates and fine you . Your father , if I know him , would refuse to pay the fine ; and to prison you would go , with the taint of it to lie upon your good name forever . The penalty would be wrong , outrageous , ruinous ; no rich man would submit to it , but a poor man must . Is this the truth , Daniel , or is it what it ought to be a scandalous misdescription of the laws of England ? "
82264	82325	81949	81949	Carne	356	" No , sir ; it is true enough , and too true , I am afraid . I never thought of consequences , when I used my axe . I only thought of what was right , and fair , and honest , as between a man who has a right , and one who takes it from him . "
82326	82421	81949	81949	Carne	356	" That is the natural way to look at things , but never permitted in this country . You are fortunate in having to deal with one who has been brought up in a juster land , where all mankind are equal . But one thing I insist upon ; and remember it is the condition of my forbearance . Not a single word to any one about your dashing exploit . No gentleman in the county would ever speak to me again , if I were known to have put up with it . "
82422	82429	82431	82431	Daniel	282	" I am sure , sir , "
82439	82531	82431	82431	Daniel	282	" I never should have done such an impudent thing against you , if I had only known what a nice gentleman you are . I took you for nothing but a haughty land - owner , without a word to fling at a poor fisherman . And now you go ever so far beyond what the Club doth , in speaking of the right that every poor man has n't . I could listen to you by the hour , sir , and learn the difference between us and abroad . "
82532	82601	81949	81949	Carne	356	" Tugwell , I could tell you things that would make a real man of you . But why should I ? You are better as you are ; and so are we who get all the good out of you . And besides , I have no time for politics at present . All my time is occupied with stern business collecting the ruins of my property . "
82602	82641	82431	82431	Daniel	282	" But , sir but you come down here sometimes from the castle in the evening ; and if I might cross , without claiming right of way , sometimes I might have the luck to meet you . "
82642	82709	81949	81949	Carne	356	" Certainly you may pass , as often as you please , and so may anybody who sets value on his rights . And if I should meet you again , I shall be glad of it . You can open my eyes , doubtless , quite as much as I can yours . Good - night , my friend , and better fortunes to you ! "
82710	82722	82723	82723	Carne	356	" It was worth my while to nail up those rails , "
82736	82772	82723	82723	Carne	356	" I have hooked that clod , as firm as ever he hooked a cod . But , thousand thunders ! what does he mean , by going away without touching his hat to me ? "
82778	82793	82795	82796	the Rector	909	" I hope , my dear , that your ride has done you good , "
82821	82832	82804	82804	he	909	" If colour proves health , you have gained it . "
82833	82930	82795	82798	the Rector 's wife	2632	" Maria , I have not been so upset for many years . Unwholesome indignation dyes my cheeks , and that is almost as bad as indigestion . I have had quite a turn as you women always put it . I am never moved by little things , as you know well , and sometimes to your great disgust ; but to - day my troubles have conspired to devour me . I am not so young as I was , Maria . And what will the parish come to , if I give in ? "
82931	82944	82945	82946	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" Exactly , dear ; and therefore you must not give in . "
82970	83006	82958	82958	she	292	" Remember your own exhortations , Joshua I am sure they were beautiful last Sunday . But take something , dear , to restore your circulation . A reaction in the system is so dangerous . "
83007	83013	82945	82946	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" Not anything at present , "
83020	83335	83014	83015	Mr. Twemlow	299	" these mental cares are beyond the reach of bodily refreshments . Let me sit down , and be sure where I am , and then you may give me a glass of treble X. In the first place , the pony nearly kicked me off , when that idiot of a Stubbard began firing from his battery . What have I done , or my peaceful flock , that a noisy set of guns should be set up amidst us ? However , I showed Juniper that he had a master , though I shall find it hard to come down - stairs tomorrow . Well , the next thing was that I saw James Cheeseman , Church - warden Cheeseman , Buttery Cheeseman , as the bad boys call him , in the lane , in front of me not more than thirty yards , as plainly as I now have the pleasure of seeing you , Maria ; and while I said ' kuck ' to the pony , he was gone ! I particularly wished to speak to Cheeseman , to ask him some questions about things I have observed , and especially his sad neglect of public worship a most shameful example on the part of a church - warden and I was thinking how to put it , affectionately yet firmly , when , to my great surprise , there was no Cheeseman to receive it ! I called at his house on my return , about three hours afterwards , having made up my mind to have it out with him , when they positively told me or at least Polly Cheeseman did that I must be mistaken about her ' dear papa , ' because he was gone in the pony - shay all the way to Uckfield , and would not be back till night . "
83336	83344	83345	83346	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" The nasty little story - teller ! "
83349	83375	83345	83346	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" But I am not at all surprised at it , when I saw how she had got her hair done up , last Sunday . "
83376	83642	83014	83015	Mr. Twemlow	299	" No ; Polly believed it . I am quite sure of that . But what I want to tell you is much stranger and more important , though it can not have anything at all to do with Cheeseman . You know , I told you I was going for a good long ride ; but I did not tell you where , because I knew that you would try to stop me . But the fact was that I had made up my mind to see what Caryl Carne is at , among his owls and ivy . You remember the last time I went to the old place I knocked till I was tired , but could get no answer , and the window was stopped with some rusty old spiked railings , where we used to be able to get in at the side . All the others are out of reach , as you know well ; and being of a yielding nature , I came sadly home . And at that time I still had some faith in your friend Mrs. Stubbard , who promised to find out all about him , by means of Widow Shanks and the Dimity - parlour . But nothing has come of that . Poor Mrs. Stubbard is almost as stupid as her husband ; and as for Widow Shanks I am quite sure , Maria , if your nephew were plotting the overthrow of King , Church , and Government , that deluded woman would not listen to a word against him . "
83643	83654	83655	83656	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" She calls him a model , and a blessed martyr "
83665	83731	83655	83656	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" and she says she is a woman of great penetration , and never will listen to anything . But it only shows what I have always said , that our family has a peculiar power , a sort of attraction , a superior gift of knowledge of their own minds , which makes them But there , you are laughing at me , Joshua ! "
83732	83953	83014	83015	Mr. Twemlow	299	" Not I ; but smiling at my own good fortune , that ever I get my own way at all . But , Maria , you are right ; your family has always been distinguished for having its own way a masterful race , and a mistressful . And so much the more do the rest of mankind grow eager to know all about them . In an ordinary mind , such as mine , that feeling becomes at last irresistible ; and finding no other way to gratify it , I resolved to take the bull by the horns , or rather by the tail , this morning . The poor old castle has been breaking up most grievously , even within the last twenty years , and you , who have played as a child among the ruins of the ramparts , would scarcely know them now . You can not bear to go there , which is natural enough , after all the sad things that have happened ; but if you did , you would be surprised , Maria ; and I believe a great part has been knocked down on purpose . But you remember the little way in from the copse , where you and I , five - and - thirty years ago "
83954	84048	83014	83015	Mr. Twemlow	299	" Of course I do , darling . It seems but yesterday ; and I have a flower now which you gathered for me there . It grew at a very giddy height upon the wall , full of cracks and places where the evening - star came through ; but up you went , like a rocket or a race - horse ; and what a fright I was in , until you came down safe ! I think that must have made up my mind to have nobody except my Joshua . "
84049	84412	83655	83656	Mrs. Twemlow	292	" Well , my dear , you might have done much worse . But I happened to think of that way in , this morning , when you put up your elbow , as you made the tea , exactly as you used to do when I might come up there . And that set me thinking of a quantity of things , and among them this plan which I resolved to carry out . I took the trouble first to be sure that Caryl was down here for the day , under the roof of Widow Shanks ; and then I set off by the road up the hill , for the stronghold of all the Carnes . Without further peril than the fight with the pony , and the strange apparition of Cheeseman about half a mile from the back entrance , I came to the copse where the violets used to be , and the sorrel , and the lords and ladies . There I tethered our friend Juniper in a quiet little nook , and crossed the soft ground , without making any noise , to the place we used to call our little postern . It looked so sad , compared with what it used to be , so desolate and brambled up and ruinous , that I scarcely should have known it , except for the gray pedestal of the prostrate dial we used to moralise about . And the ground inside it , that was nice turf once , with the rill running down it that perhaps supplied the moat all stony now , and overgrown , and tangled , with ugly - looking elder - bushes sprawling through the ivy . To a painter it might have proved very attractive ; but to me it seemed so dreary , and so sombre , and oppressive , that , although I am not sentimental , as you know , I actually turned away , to put my little visit off , until I should be in better spirits for it . And that , my dear Maria , would in all probability have been never . "
84560	84561	84562	84562	My	0	" "
84602	84603	84596	84596	you	6598	" "
84992	85143	85161	85161	they	2654	" By this time I had quite recovered all my self - command , and was as calm as I am now , or even calmer , because I was under that reaction which ensues when a sensible man has made a fool of himself . I perceived , without thinking , that the sound which had so scared me proceeded from this gangway , or timberway , or staging , or whatever may be the right word for it ; and I made up my mind to stay where I was , only stooping a little with my body towards the wall , to get some idea of what might be going forward . And then I heard a sort of small hubbub of voices , such as foreigners make when they are ordered to keep quiet , and have to carry on a struggle with their noisy nature . "
85310	85550	85551	85554	Some of these briars	2664	" Maria , you know that I can hold my own against almost anybody in the world but you ; and although this place is far outside my parish boundaries , I felt that as the Uncle of the present owner so far at least as the lawyers have not snapped him up and the brother - in - law of the previous proprietor , I possessed an undeniable legal right quo warranto , or whatever it is called to look into all proceedings on these premises . Next to Holy Scripture , Horace is my guide and guardian ; and I called to mind a well - known passage , which may roughly be rendered thus : ' If the crushed world tumble on him , the ruins shall strike him undismayed . ' With this in my head , I went softly down the side - wall of the Dial - court for there was no getting through the place where I had been peeping to the bottom , where there used to be an old flint wall , and a hedge of sweet - briar in front of it . You remember the pretty conceit I made quaint and wholesome as one of Herrick 's when you said something but I verily believe we were better in those days than we ever have been since . Now do n't interrupt me about that , my dear . "
85801	86045	85794	85796	a merciful Providence	2677	" Too late I regretted the desire for knowledge , which had led me into this predicament , for I durst not rush off from my very sad position , for my breath would soon fail me , and my lower limbs are thick from the exercise of hospitality . How I longed for the wings of a dove , or at any rate for the legs of Lieutenant Blyth Scudamore ! And my dark apprehensions gained double force when a stone was dislodged by my foot which may have trembled , and rolled with a sharp echo down into the ballium , or whatever it should be called , where these desperadoes stood . In an instant three of them had their long guns pointed at the very thicket which sheltered me , and if I had moved or attempted to make off , there would have been a vacancy in this preferment . But luckily a rabbit , who had been lying as close as I had , and as much afraid of me perhaps as I was of those ruffians , set off at full speed from the hop of the stone , and they saw him , and took him for the cause of it . This enabled me to draw my breath again , and consider the best way of making my escape , for I cared to see nothing more , except my own house - door . "
86294	86295	86289	86290	the Sphinx	2686	" "
86307	86316	86299	86299	you	0	" Mrs. Twemlow enquired , as behoved her . "
86344	86345	86332	86332	you	0	" "
86355	86362	86332	86332	you	0	" the Rector answered , simply . "
86481	86481	86474	86474	I	0	"
86845	86859	86861	86862	Zebedee Tugwell	278	" Long time have I lived , and a sight have I seed , "
86867	86992	86861	86862	Zebedee Tugwell	278	" of things as I could n't make no head nor tail of ; but nothing to my knowledge ever coom nigh the sort of way our folk has taken to go on . Parson Twemlow told us , when the war began again , that the Lord could turn us all into Frenchmen , if we sinned against Him more than He could bear . I were fool enough to laugh about it then , not intaking how it could be on this side of Kingdom Come , where no distinction is of persons . But now , there it is a thing the Almighty hath in hand ; and who shall say Him nay , when He layeth His hand to it ? "
86993	87007	87008	87009	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" I reckon , ' a hath begun with you too , Zeb , "
87015	87105	87008	87009	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" To be always going on so about trash trifles , as a woman hath a right to fly up at , but no man ! Surely Dan hath a right to his politics and his parables , as much as any lame old chap that sitteth on a bench . He works hard all day , and he airns his money ; and any man hath a right to wag his tongue of night - time , when his arms and his legs have been wagging all day . "
87106	87115	87119	87120	old Tugwell	282	" Depends upon how he wags ' un . "
87135	87224	87129	87129	his	282	" If for a yarn , to plaise children or maidens , or a bit of argyment about his business , or talk about his neighbours , or aught that consarns him why , lads must be fools , and I can smoke my pipe and think that at his age I was like him . But when it comes to talking of his betters , and the Government , and the right of everybody to command the ship , and the soup soup , what was it ? "
87225	87254	87008	87009	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" Superior position of the working classes , dignity of labour , undefeasible rights of mankind to the soil as they was born in , and soshallistick something . "
87255	87262	87263	87264	Mr. Tugwell	288	" So shall I stick equality , "
87269	87359	87263	87264	Mr. Tugwell	288	" and so shall I stick him , by the holy poker , afore the end of the week is out . I 've a - been fool enough to leave off ropesending of him now for a matter of two years , because ' a was good , and outgrowing of it like , and because you always coom between us . But mind you , mother , I 'll have none of that , next time . Business I means , and good measure it shall be . "
87360	87364	87366	87367	his wife	6501	" Zeb Tugwell , "
87384	87426	87366	87367	his wife	6501	" you can never mean to say that you would lay your hand on Dan a grown man , a'most as big as yourself , and a good half - head taller ! Suppose he was to hit you back again ! "
87427	87438	87439	87439	Zeb	337	" If he did , I should just kill him , "
87444	87514	87439	87439	Zeb	337	" He would be but a jellyfish in my two hands . But there , I 'll not talk about it , mother . No need to trouble you with it . ' Tis none of my seeking the Lord in heaven knows but a job as He hath dutified for me to do . I 'll go out , and have my pipe , and dwell on it . "
87515	87527	87528	87529	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" And I may lay a deal of it on myself , "
87541	87685	87528	87529	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" for I have cockered Dan up , and there 's no denying it , afore Tim , or Tryphena , or Tabby , or Debby , or even little Solomon . Because he were the first , and so like his dear father , afore he got on in the world so . Oh , it all comes of that , all the troubles comes of that , and of laying up of money , apart from your wife , and forgetting almost of her Christian name ! And the very same thing of it money , money , and the getting on with breeches that requireth no mending , and the looking over Church - books at gay young ladies all of it leadeth to the same bad end of his betters , and the Government , and the Soshallistick Quality . "
87693	87727	87439	87439	Zeb	337	" continued Mrs. Tugwell , though not in a continuous frame of mind , as Daniel came in , with a slow heavy step , and sat down by the fire in silence , "
87914	88008	88009	88009	He	2721	" Dan knew that the future fair owner and duster designed by his mother was Miss Cheeseman , towards whom he had cherished tender yearnings in the sensible and wholesome days . And if Polly Cheeseman had hung herself on high which she might have done without a bit of arrogance perhaps she would still have been to this young man the star of fate and glory , instead of a dip , thirty - two to the pound ; the like whereof she sold for a farthing . Distance makes the difference . "
88022	88036	88009	88009	He	2721	" the good mother grew warm , as the son began to whistle ; "
88216	88217	88212	88212	I	0	" "

88426	88440	88416	88416	I	0	" said Daniel , moved from his high ropes by this last appeal ; "

88803	88836	88796	88796	you	2746	" the poor mother fell into the settle , away from the fire - light , and put both hands over her eyes , to shut out the spectacle of Dan dangling ; "
89063	89114	89117	89117	you	282	" Mrs. Tugwell 's tender recollections had given her a pain in the part where Dan was nursed , and driven her out of true logical course ; but she came back to it , before Dan had time to finish the interesting pictures of himself which she had suggested . "

91236	91260	91234	91234	Dan	282	" I work hard enough all day . I just looked in at the Club , and had a little talk of politics . "
91261	91293	91193	91193	his	1398	" The Club , indeed ! The stinking barrow - grinders ! Did I tell you , or did I forget to tell you , never to go there no more ? "
91294	91336	91193	91193	his	1398	" You told me fast enough , father ; no doubt about that . But I am not aboard your boat , when I happen on dry land , and I am old enough now to have opinions of my own . "
91337	91395	91234	91234	Dan	282	" Oh , that 's it , is it ? And to upset all the State , the King , the House of Lords , and the Parliamentary House , and all as is descended from the Romans ? Well , and what did their Wusships say to you ? Did they anoint you king of slooshings ? "
91396	91411	91412	91412	Dan	282	" Father , they did this and you have a right to know it ; "
91438	91524	91427	91427	he	282	" almost before I knew what was coming , they had made me a member , and I signed the book . They have no desire to upset the kingdom ; I heard no talk of that kind ; only that every man should have his own opinions , and be free to show what can be said for them . And you know , father , that the world goes on by reason , and justice , and good - will , and fair play "
91525	91532	91534	91535	the captain	1173	" No , it do n't , "
91544	91618	91534	91535	the captain	1173	" if it had to wait for they , it would never go on at all . It goes on by government , and management , and discipline , and the stopping of younkers from their blessed foolery , and by the ten commandments , and the proverbs of King Solomon . You to teach your father how the world goes on ! Off with your coat , and I 'll teach you . "
91619	91622	91624	91624	Dan	282	" Father , "
91653	91668	91534	91535	the captain	1173	" you will never do such a thing , at my age and size ? "

91692	91720	91676	91676	Zebedee	278	" As for your age , why , it ought to know better ; and as for your size , why , the more room for this ! "

91868	91890	91775	91775	he	282	" As if you did n't know , father ! The fifteenth of last March I was twenty years of age . "

92179	92209	92171	92171	he	2871	" He says that I am no son of his , and this looks like it . Signed , Daniel Tugwell , or whatever my name ought to be . "
92444	92487	92436	92436	she	466	" I can see Dan , mother , but I ca n't see Him . Can I sit in His lap , mother , and look into His face , and be told pretty stories , and eat apples all the time ? "
93441	93444	93446	93448	the tall man	2929	" Daniel , "
93453	93489	93446	93448	the tall man	2929	" my sight is very bad at night , but unless it is worse than usual , you are my admired friend Daniel . A young man in a thousand one who dares to think . "
93490	93496	93497	93499	the admired friend	2930	" Yes , Squire Carne , "
93514	93536	93497	93499	the admired friend	2930	" Dan Tugwell , at your service . And I have thought too much , and been paid out for it . "
93537	93551	93446	93448	the tall man	2929	" You see me in a melancholy attitude , and among melancholy surroundings . "
93569	93644	93562	93562	Dan	282	" The truth is , that anger at a gross injustice , which has just come to my knowledge , drove me from my books and sad family papers , in the room beneath the roof of our good Widow Shanks . And I needs must come down here , to think beside the sea , which seems to be the only free thing in England . But I little expected to see you . "
93645	93672	93497	93499	the admired friend	2930	" And I little expected to be here , Squire Carne . But if not making too bold to ask was it anybody that was beaten ? "
93673	93740	93562	93562	Dan	282	" Beaten is not the right word for it , Dan ; cruelly flogged and lashed , a dear young friend of mine has been , as fine a young fellow as ever lived and now he has not got a sound place on his back . And why ? Because he was poor , and dared to lift his eyes to a rich young lady . "
93741	93752	93754	93754	Dan	282	" But he was not flogged by his own father ? "
93774	93782	93784	93785	the other	893	" Not quite so bad as that , "
93836	93969	93974	93976	my young friend	6693	" A very black suspicion crossed the mind of Dan , for Carne possessed the art of suggesting vile suspicions : might Admiral Darling have discovered something , and requested Dan 's father to correct him ? It was certain that the Admiral , so kind of heart , would never have desired such severity ; but he might have told Captain Tugwell , with whom he had a talk almost every time they met , that his eldest son wanted a little discipline ; and the Club might have served as a pretext for this , when the true crime must not be declared , by reason of its enormity . Dan closed his teeth , and English air grew bitter in his mouth , as this belief ran through him . "
93984	94008	93978	93978	I	0	" Carne continued , briskly , for he knew that a nail snaps in good oak , when the hammer falls too heavily . "

94185	94186	94187	94187	Dan	282	" "

94339	94346	94336	94337	Squire Carne	357	" cried Dan , pursuing him , "

94392	94399	94378	94378	you	357	" exclaimed Carne , with amazement . "
94456	94457	94446	94449	your dear good father	2959	" "
94472	94483	94458	94458	I	0	" Dan forgot all his home - pride at last . "

94698	94709	94731	94731	He	6666	" Carne asked , in a tone of deep compassion ; "

94779	94780	94764	94764	You	282	" "
94791	94804	94764	94764	You	282	" the voice of this kind gentleman betrayed that he was shuddering . "
94844	94845	94831	94831	He	6666	" "
94861	94885	94847	94847	they	2975	" In spite of all his pain and grief , Dan could not help smiling at the thought of his father ropesending himself . "
94897	94898	94847	94847	they	2975	" "
95037	95038	95039	95039	Me	0	" "
95043	95062	95039	95039	Me	0	" cried Dan , jumping back , in a style which showed the distance between faith and argument ; "

95189	95201	95187	95187	Daniel	282	" answered Caryl Carne , in alarm at this British sentiment ; "
95375	95438	95508	95508	you	6639	" Carne who had taken most kindly to the fortune which made him an untrue Englishman clapped his breast with both hands ; not proudly , as a Frenchman does , nor yet with that abashment and contempt of demonstration which make a true Briton very clumsy in such doings ; while Daniel Tugwell , being very solid , and by no means "
95440	95482	95485	95485	sir	6639	" as people call it nowadays was looking at him , to the utmost of his power which would have been greater by daylight , with gratitude , and wonder , and consideration , and some hesitation about his foreign sentiments . "
95487	95500	95508	95508	you	6639	" said Dan , with the usual impulse of the British workman , "
95527	95528	95508	95508	you	6639	" "

95640	95661	95638	95638	sir	6639	" Daniel asked , with sore misgivings , for he had been brought up to be very shy of that . "
95686	95687	95675	95675	I	0	" "
95703	95725	95675	95675	I	0	" Carne never could resist the chance of a little bit of sarcasm , though it often injured his own plots . "
95779	95824	95771	95771	you	282	" Despite the stupid outrage upon himself , Dan was too loyal and generous of nature to be pleased with this description of his native place . But Carne , too quick of temper for a really fine intriguer , cut short his expostulations . "
95831	95835	95771	95771	you	282	" he said ; "
95950	96013	96014	96014	He	0	" The waning moon had risen , and now shone upon Carne 's face , lighting up all its gloomy beauty , and strange power of sadness . Dan seemed to lose his clear keen sight beneath the dark influence of the other 's gaze ; and his will , though not a weak one , dropped before a larger and stronger . "
96023	96032	96014	96014	He	0	" said the poor young fisherman to himself ; "
96081	96129	96074	96074	I	0	" This was a bitter reflection to him , and might have inclined him the right way , if time had allowed him to work it out . But no such time was afforded ; and in the confusion and gratitude of the moment , he answered , "
96152	96166	96142	96142	my	0	" Caryl Carne smiled ; and the church clock of Springhaven solemnly struck midnight .

96636	96727	96631	96631	she	297	" that even his name should be interdicted , as if he had disgraced himself . If he is dead , he has died with honour . None who ever saw him can doubt that . But he is not dead . He will come back to us , perhaps next week , perhaps to - morrow , perhaps even while we are afraid to speak of him . If it is for my sake that you behave thus , I am not quite so weak as to require it . "
96780	99487	96774	96774	they	3028	" could have done nothing with a case like this , because there was no beginning it . Even now , in fair peace , and with large knowledge added , the matter would not have been easy ; but in war universal , and blank ignorance , there was nothing to be done but to sit down and think . And the story invited a good deal of thinking , because of its disappointing turn . During the negotiations for peace in 1801 , and before any articles were signed , orders were sent to the Cape of Good Hope for the return of a regiment of the line , which had not been more than three months there . But the Cape was likely to be restored to Holland , and two empty transports returning from India were to call under convoy , and bring home these troops . One of the officers was Captain Erle Twemlow , then about twenty - five years of age , and under probation , by the Admiral 's decree , for the hand of the maiden whose heart had been his from a time to itself immemorial . After tiresome days of impatience , the transports arrived under conduct of a frigate ; and after another week , the soldiers embarked with fine readiness for their native land . But before they had cleared the Bay , they met a brig - of - war direct from Portsmouth , carrying despatches for the officer in command of the troops , as well as for the captain of the frigate . Some barbarous tribes on the coast of Guinea , the part that is called the Ivory Coast , had plundered and burnt a British trading station within a few miles of Cape Palmas , and had killed and devoured the traders . These natives must be punished , and a stern example made , and a negro monarch of the name of Hunko Jum must have his palace burned , if he possessed one ; while his rival , the king of the Crumbo tribe , whose name was Bandeliah , who had striven to protect the traders , must be rewarded , and have a treaty made with him , if he could be brought to understand it . Both sailors and soldiers were ready enough to undertake this little spree , as they called it , expecting to have a pleasant run ashore , a fine bit of sport with the negroes , and perhaps a few noserings of gold to take home to their wives and sweethearts . But , alas ! the reality was not so fine . The negroes who had done all the mischief made off , carrying most of their houses with them ; and the palace of Hunko Jum , if he possessed one , was always a little way further on . The Colonel was a stubborn man , and so was the sea - captain good Tories both , and not desirous to skulk out of scrapes , and leave better men to pick up their clumsy breakages . Blue and red vied with one another to scour the country , and punish the natives if only they could catch them and to vindicate , with much strong language , the dignity of Great Britain , and to make an eternal example . But white bones are what the white man makes , under that slimy sunshine and putrefying moon . Weary , slack - jointed , low - hearted as they were , the deadly coast - fever fell upon them , and they shivered , and burned , and groaned , and raved , and leaped into holes , or rolled into camp fires . The Colonel died early , and the Naval Captain followed him ; none stood upon the order of their going ; but man followed man , as in a funeral , to the grave , until there was no grave to go to . The hand of the Lord was stretched out against them ; and never would one have come back to England , out of more than five hundred who landed , except for the manhood and vigour of a seaman , Captain Southcombe , of the transport Gwalior . This brave and sensible man had been left with his ship lying off to be signalled for , in case of mishap , while his consort and the frigate were despatched in advance to a creek , about twenty leagues westward , where the land - force triumphant was to join them . Captain Southcombe , with every hand he could muster , traced the unfortunate party inland , and found them led many leagues in the wrong direction , lost among quagmires breathing death , worn out with vermin , venom , and despair , and hemmed in by savages lurking for the night , to rush in upon and make an end of them . What need of many words ? This man , and his comrades , did more than any other men on the face of this earth could have done without British blood in them . They buried the many who had died without hope of the decent concealment which our life has had , and therefore our death longs for ; they took on their shoulders , or on cane wattles , the many who had made up their minds to die , and were in much doubt about having done it , and they roused up and worked up by the scruff of their loose places the few who could get along on their own legs . And so , with great spirit , and still greater patience , they managed to save quite as many as deserved it . Because , when they came within signal of the Gwalior , Captain Southcombe , marching slowly with his long limp burdens , found ready on the sand the little barrel , about as big as a kilderkin , of true and unsullied Stockholm pitch , which he had taken , as his brother took Madeira , for ripeness and for betterance , by right of change of climate . With a little of this given choicely and carefully at the back of every sick man 's tongue , and a little more spread across the hollow of his stomach , he found them so enabled in the afternoon that they were glad to sit up in the bottom of a boat , and resign themselves to an All - wise Providence . Many survived , and blessed Captain Southcombe , not at first cordially for the man yet remains to be discovered who is grateful to his doctor but gradually more and more , and with that healthy action of the human bosom which is called expectoration , whenever grateful memories were rekindled by the smell of tar . But this is a trifle ; many useful lives were saved , and the Nation should have thanked Captain Southcombe , but did not . After these sad incidents , when sorrow for old friends was tempered by the friendly warmth afforded by their shoes , a muster was held by the Major in command , and there was only one officer who could neither assert himself alive , nor be certified as dead . That one was Erle Twemlow , and the regiment would rather have lost any other two officers . Urgent as it was , for the safety of the rest , to fly with every feather from this pestilential coast , sails were handed , boats despatched , and dealings tried with Hunko Jum , who had reappeared with promptitude , the moment he was not wanted . From this noble monarch , and his chiefs , and all his nation , it was hard to get any clear intelligence , because their own was absorbed in absorbing . They had found upon the sands a cask of Admiralty rum , as well as a stout residue of unadulterated pitch . Noses , and tongues , and historical romance for a cask had been washed ashore five generations since , and set up for a god , when the last drop was licked induced this brave nation to begin upon the rum ; and fashion as powerful with them as with us compelled them to drink the tar likewise , because they had seen the white men doing it . This would have made it hard to understand them , even if they had been English scholars , which their ignorance of rum proved them not to be ; and our sailors very nearly went their way , after sadly ascertaining nothing , except that the cask was empty . But luckily , just as they were pushing off , a very large , black head appeared from behind a vegetable - ivory tree , less than a quarter of a mile away , and they knew that this belonged to Bandeliah , the revered king of the Crumbos , who had evidently smelled rum far inland . With him they were enabled to hold discourse , partly by signs , and partly by means of an old and highly polished negro , who had been the rat - catcher at the factory now consumed ; and the conclusion , or perhaps the confusion , arrived at from signs , grunts , grins , nods , waggings of fingers and twistings of toes , translated grandiloquently into broken English , was not far from being to the following effect : To wit , that two great kings reigned inland , either of them able to eat up Hunko Jum and Bandeliah at a mouthful , but both of them too proud to set foot upon land that was flat , or in water that was salt . They ruled over two great nations called the Houlas , and the Quackwas , going out of sight among great rivers and lands with clear water standing over them . And if the white men could not understand this , it was because they drank salt - water . Moreover , they said that of these two kings , the king of the Houlas was a woman , the most beautiful ever seen in all the world , and able to jump over any man 's head . But the king of the Quackwas was a man , and although he had more than two thousand wives , and was taller by a joint of a bamboo than Bandeliah whose stature was at least six feet four yet nothing would be of any use to him , unless he could come to an agreement with Mabonga , the queen of the Houlas , to split a durra straw with him . But Mabonga was coy , and understanding men , as well as jumping over them , would grant them no other favour than the acceptance of their presents . However , the other great king was determined to have her for his wife , if he abolished all the rest , and for this reason he had caught and kept the lost Englishman as a medicine - man ; and it was not likely that he would kill him , until he failed or succeeded . To further enquiries Bandeliah answered that to rescue the prisoner was impossible . If it had been his own newest wife , he would not push out a toe for her . The great king Golo lived up in high places that overlooked the ground , as he would these white men , and his armies went like wind and spread like fire . None of his warriors ate white man 's flesh ; they were afraid it would make them cowardly . A brave heart is generally tender in the middle , to make up for being so firm outside , even as the Durian fruit is . Captain Southcombe had walked the poop - deck of the Gwalior many a time , in the cool of the night , with Erle Twemlow for his companion , and had taken a very warm liking to him . So that when the survivors of the regiment were landed at Portsmouth , this brave sailor travelled at his own cost to Springhaven , and told the Rector the whole sad story , making it clear to him beyond all doubt , that nothing whatever could be done to rescue the poor young man from those savages , or even to ascertain his fate . For the Quackwas were an inland tribe , inhabiting vast regions wholly unknown to any European , and believed to extend to some mighty rivers , and lakes resembling inland seas . Therefore Mr. Twemlow , in a deep quiet voice , asked Captain Southcombe one question only whether he might keep any hope of ever having , by the mercy of the Lord , his only son restored to him . And the sailor said yes ; the mistake would be ever to abandon such a hope , for at the moment he least expected it , his son might stand before him . He pretended to no experience of the western coast of Africa , and niggers he knew were a very queer lot , acting according to their own lights , which differed according to their natures . But he was free to say , that in such a condition he never would think of despairing , though it might become very hard not to do so , as time went on without bringing any news . He himself had been in sad peril more than once , and once it appeared quite hopeless ; but he thought of his wife and his children at home , and the Lord had been pleased to deliver him . The parson was rebuked by this brave man 's faith , who made no pretence whatever to piety ; and when they said Goodbye , their eyes were bright with the goodwill and pity of the human race , who know trouble not inflicted as yet upon monkeys . Mr. Twemlow 's heart fell when the sailor was gone , quite as if he had lost his own mainstay ; but he braced himself up to the heavy duty of imparting sad news to his wife and daughter , and worst of all to Faith Darling . But the latter surprised him by the way in which she bore it ; for while she made no pretence to hide her tears , she was speaking as if they were needless . And the strangest thing of all , in Mr. Twemlow 's opinion , was her curious persistence about Queen Mabonga . Could any black woman and she supposed she must be that be considered by white people to be beautiful ? Had Captain Southcombe ever even seen her ; and if not , how could he be in such raptures about her attractions ? She did not like to say a word , because he had been so kind and so faithful to those poor soldiers , whom it was his duty to bring home safe ; but if it had not been for that , she might have thought that with so many children and a wife at Limehouse , he should not have allowed his mind to dwell so fondly on the personal appearance of a negress ! The Rector was astonished at this injustice , and began to revise his opinion about Faith as the fairest and sweetest girl in all the world ; but Mrs. Twemlow smiled , when she had left off crying , and said that she liked the dear child all the better for concluding that Ponga or whatever her name was must of necessity and at the first glance fall desperately in love with her own Erle . Then the Rector cried , "
99513	99667	99499	99499	he	3029	" Two years now , two years of quiet patience , of busy cheerfulness now and then , and of kindness to others always , had made of Faith Darling a lady to be loved for a hundred years , and for ever . The sense of her sorrow was never far from her , yet never brought near to any other by herself ; and her smile was as warm , and her eyes as bright , as if there had never been a shadow on her youth . To be greeted by her , and to receive her hand , and one sweet glance of her large goodwill , was enough to make an old man feel that he must have been good at some time , and a young man hope that he should be so by - and - by ; though the tendency was generally contented with the hope .

100343	100350	100351	100351	he	282	" If you please , miss , "
100374	100388	100323	100323	her	297	" if you please , miss , things are very hard upon me . "
100389	100394	100395	100395	she	297	" Is it money ? "
100412	100435	100395	100395	she	297	" if it is , I shall be so glad that I happen to have a good bit put by just now . "
100456	100464	100465	100465	she	297	" Oh , I might have known , "
100468	100535	100465	100465	she	297	" that it was nothing of that kind . You are always so industrious and steady . But what can it be ? Is it anything about Captain Stubbard and his men , because I know you do not like them , and none of the old Springhaven people seem to do so ? Have you been obliged to fight with any of them , Daniel ? "
100536	100598	100616	100616	her	297	" No , miss , no . I would not soil my hand by laying it on any of such chaps as those . Unless they should go for to insult me , I mean , or any one belonging to me . No , miss , no . It is ten times worse than money , or assault and battery . "
100599	100611	100613	100613	Faith	297	" Well , Daniel , I would not on any account , "
100631	100712	100713	100713	He	3063	" on no account would I desire to know anything that you do not seem to think my advice might help you to get out of . I am not in a hurry , but still my time is getting rather late for what I have to do . By the time I come back from the rectory , perhaps you will have made up your mind about it . Till then , good - bye to you , Daniel . "
100730	100746	100721	100721	she	297	" Then goodbye , miss ; I shall be far away when you come back . "
100793	100802	100803	100803	she	277	" Dan , this is unworthy of you , "
100814	100836	100803	100803	she	277	" Have I ever been hard or unkind to you , Dan , that you should be so afraid of me ? "
100837	100894	100807	100807	her	277	" No , miss , never . But too much the other way . That makes it so bad for me to say good - bye . I am going away , miss . I must be off this evening . I never shall see Springhaven no more , nor you , miss nor nobody else . "
100895	101015	100807	100807	her	277	" It is quite impossible , Dan . You must be dreaming . You do n't look at all like yourself to - day . You have been doing too much over - time . I have heard all about it , and how very hard you work . I have been quite sorry for you on Sundays , to see you in the gallery , without a bit of rest , still obliged to give the time with your elbow . I have often been astonished that your mother could allow it . Why , Dan , if you go away , you will break her heart , and I do n't know how many more in Springhaven . "
101016	101076	100803	100803	she	277	" No , miss , no . They very soon mends them . It is the one as goes away that gets a deal the worst of it . I am sure I do n't know whatever I shall do , without the old work to attend to . But it will get on just as well without me . "
101077	101084	101086	101086	Faith	297	" No , it wo n't , "
101103	101125	101096	101096	her	297	" nothing will be the same , when you are gone , Daniel ; and you ought to have more consideration . "
101126	101139	101140	101140	he	3064	" I am going with a good man , at any rate , "
101143	101169	101140	101140	he	3064	" the freest - minded gentleman that ever came to these parts . Squire Carne , of Carne Castle , if you please , miss . "
101170	101175	101177	101177	Faith	297	" Mr. Caryl Carne ! "
101192	101205	101184	101184	Daniel	282	" Is he going away ? Oh , I am so glad ! "
101206	101260	101140	101140	he	3064	" No , miss ; not Squire Carne himself . Only to provide for me work far away , and not to be beholden any more to my own people . And work where a man may earn and keep his own money , and hold up his head while adoing of it . "
101261	101318	101140	101140	he	3064	" Oh , Dan , you know more of such things than I do . And every man has a right to be independent , and ought to be so , and I should despise him otherwise . But do n't be driven by it into the opposite extreme of disliking the people in a different rank "
101319	101341	101184	101184	Daniel	282	" No , miss , there is no fear of that the only fear is liking some of them too much . "
101342	101346	101348	101348	Faith	297	" And then , "
101362	101445	101348	101348	Faith	297	" you must try to remember that if you work hard , so do we , or nearly all of us . From the time my father gets up in the morning , to the time when he goes to bed at night , he has not got five minutes as he tells us every day for attending to anything but business . Even at dinner , when you get a good hour , and wo n't be disturbed now will you ? "
101446	101474	101184	101184	Daniel	282	" No , miss ; not if all the work was tumbling down . No workman as respects himself would take fifty - nine minutes for sixty . "
101475	101593	101348	101348	Faith	297	" Exactly so ; and you are right . You stand up for your rights . Your dinner you have earned , and you will have it . And the same with your breakfast , and your supper too , and a good long night to get over it . Do you jump up in bed , before you have shut both eyes , hearing or fancying you have heard the bell , that calls you out into the cold , and the dark , and a wet saddle , from a warm pillow ? And putting that by , as a trouble of the war , and the chance of being shot at by dark tall men "
101611	101798	101799	101799	Dan	282	" have you to consider , at every turn , that whatever you do though you mean it for the best will be twisted and turned against you by some one , and made into wickedness that you never dreamed of , by envious people , whose grudge against you is that they fancy you look down on them ? Though I am sure of one thing , and that is that my father , instead of looking down upon any honest man because he is poor , looks up to him ; and so do I ; and so does every gentleman or lady . And any one who goes about to persuade the working - people as they are called , because they have to use their hands more that people like my father look down upon them , and treat them like dogs , and all those wicked stories all I can say is , any man who does it deserves to be put in the stocks , or the pillory , or even to be transported as an enemy to his country . "
101825	101828	101821	101823	the old people	3067	" mannersome , "
101929	101941	101942	101943	Miss Darling	277	" I am certain that you never thought of such things , "
101952	102132	101942	101943	Miss Darling	277	" you are much too industrious and sensible for that . But I hear that some persons are now in our parish who make it their business , for some reason of their own , to spread ill - will and jealousy and hatred everywhere , to make us all strangers and foes to one another , and foreigners to our own country . We have enemies enough , by the will of the Lord as Mr. Twemlow says , for a sharp trial to us , and a lesson to our pride , and a deep source of gratitude , and charity , and good - will though I scarcely understand how they come in and , above all , a warning to us to stick together , and not exactly hate , but still abhor , everybody who has a word to say against his own country at a time like this . And ten thousand times as much , if he is afraid to say it , but crawls with crafty poison into simple English bosoms . "
102133	102148	102149	102151	the young fisherman	3069	" There is nothing of that , miss , to my knowledge , here , "
102156	102209	102149	102151	the young fisherman	3069	" Springhaven would never stand none of that ; and the club drinks the health of King George every night of their meeting , and stamps on the floor for him . But I never shall help to do that any more . I must be going , miss and thank you . "
102210	102303	101947	101947	her	277	" Then you will not tell me why you go ? You speak of it as if it was against your will , and yet refuse to say what drives you . Have you been poaching , Dan ? Ah , that is it ! But I can beg you off immediately . My father is very good even to strangers , and as for his doing anything to you have no fear , Dan ; you shall not be charged with it , even if you have been in Brown Bushes . "
102395	102399	102401	102402	Miss Darling	277	" Daniel Tugwell , "
102406	102469	102401	102402	Miss Darling	277	" if you have not been fighting , or conspiring against society , or even poaching , I can well understand that you may have reasons for not desiring my assistance or advice . And I only wonder that under such circumstances you took the trouble to wait for me here , as you appear to have done . Good - bye . "
102470	102486	102488	102488	Daniel	282	" Oh , do n't be cross , miss ! please not to be cross , "
102494	102596	102488	102488	Daniel	282	" I would tell you all about it this very instant moment , if it were behoving to me . You will hear all about it when you get to Parson Twemlow 's , for I saw mother going there , afore she had her breakfast , though I was not concernable to let her see me . If the Squire had been home , she would have gone up to Hall first . No , miss , no . I done nothing to be ashamed of ; and if you turn back on me , you 'll be sorry afterwards . "
102652	102734	102641	102641	his	282	" You always were too good , Miss Faith , too good to be hard upon any one , and I am sure you have not been hard upon me ; for I know that I look disrespectable . But I could n't find words to say what I wanted , until you spoke so soft and kind . And perhaps , when I say it , you 'll be angry with me , and think that I trespass upon you . "
102735	102785	102619	102619	She	297	" No , I wo n't , Dan ; I will promise you that . You may tell me , as if I were Mr. Swipes , who says that he never lost his temper in his life , because he is always right , and other people wrong . "
102786	102949	102619	102619	She	297	" Well , miss , I 'm afraid that I am not like that , and that makes me feel so uncomfortable with the difference between us . Because it is all about Miss Dolly , and I might seem so impudent . But you know that I would go through fire and water to serve Miss Dolly , and I durstn't go away forever without one message to her . If I was in her own rank of life , God Almighty alone should part us , whether I was rich or whether I was poor , and I 'd like to see any one come near her ! But being only an ignorant fellow without any birth or book - learning , I am not such a fool as to forget that the breadth of the world lies between us . Only I may wish her well , all the same I may wish her well and happy , miss ? "
102950	102955	102956	102956	Faith	315	" Certainly you may . "
102971	103003	102956	102956	Faith	315	" You have saved her life . She respects and likes you , the same as my father and I do . You may trust me with your message , Dan . "
103004	103041	102619	102619	She	297	" I suppose it would not be the proper thing for me to see her once before I go ; just for one minute , with you standing by her , that I might that she might "
103042	103045	103047	103047	Faith	315	" No , "
103057	103093	103047	103047	Faith	315	" we must not think of that , Dan . It could do you no good , and it might do her harm . But if you have any message , to be useful to her "
103094	103271	103272	103272	He	3075	" The useful part of it must be through you , miss , and not sent to her at all , I think , or it would be very impertinent . The kind part is to give her my good - bye , and say that I would die to help her . And the useful part is for yourself . For God 's sake , miss , do keep Miss Dolly out of the way of Squire Carne ! He hath a tongue equal to any woman , with the mind of a man beneath it . He hath gotten me body and soul ; because I care not the skin of a dab what befalls me . But oh , miss , he never must get Miss Dolly . He may be a very good man in some ways , and he is wonderful free - minded ; but any young lady as marries him had better have leaped into the Culver Hole . Farewell , miss , now that I have told you . "
103321	103326	103314	103314	she	315	" Farewell , Daniel ! "
103330	103336	103337	103338	Mr. Swipes	309	" They cocks and hens , "
103349	103469	103470	103471	Admiral Darling	332	" bless you , my lord , they cocks and hens knows a good bit of gardening as well as I do . They calls one another , and they comes to see it , and they puts their heads to one side and talks about it , and they say to one another , ' Must be something good there , or he would n't have made it so bootiful ' ; and then up go their combs , and they tear away into it , like a passel of Scotchmen at a scratching - match . If your lordship wo n't put a lock on the door , you will never taste a bit of good vegetable . "

104984	105081	104973	104974	Mrs. Knuckledown	488	" Too bad for that old beast to keep us locked out from the very place us ought to have for pommylarding , because he saith all the fruit would go into our pockets . And what goes into his'en , I should like to know ? Suppose I lock him out , as he hath locked us out . He wo n't be back yet for half an hour , anyway .

106781	106814	106763	106763	I	0	" Mary could not give up the paper , because it was a letter from one of her adorers , which , with the aid of Jenny Shanks , she had interpreted . "
106819	106828	106763	106763	I	0	" she said , with a coaxing look ; "
106942	106990	106991	106991	You	309	" Mr. Swipes went muttering up the walk , and was forced to cut two of the finest cauliflowers intended for Cheeseman 's adornment to - morrow . This turned his heart very sour again , and he shook his head , growling in self - commune : "
107037	107037	107028	107028	I	0	"
107207	107213	107215	107216	Mr. Prater	358	" But now , but now "
107257	107318	107239	107239	she	6501	" now we shall see what Springhaven can do for the good of the Country and the glory of herself . Two bottles and a half a head is the lowest that can be charged for , with the treble X outside , and the punch to follow after . His lordship is the gentleman to keep the bottle going . "
107350	107357	107359	107360	his lordship	8990	" Short tongue and long throat , "
107372	107381	107387	107387	his	358	" Bottle to the gentleman on my left ! "
107875	107886	107887	107888	the Admiral	747	" When shall Twemlow and I have a hobnob again ? "
107895	108012	107887	107888	the Admiral	747	" How the dear old fellow loves to see the image of his glass upon the table , and the ruby of his port reflected ! Heigho ! I am getting very stiff in the back , and never a decent bit of dinner for'ard . And as for a glass of good wine oh Lord ! my timbers will be broken up , before it comes to mend them . And when I come home for even half an hour , there is all this small rubbish to attend to . I must have Frank home , to take this stuff off my hands , or else keep what I abominate , a private secretary . "
108083	108237	108080	108080	he	747	" Hon'd Sir . These foo lines comes from a umble but arty frend to command . Rekwesting of your pardon sir , i have kep a hi same been father of good dawters on the goings on of your fammeley . Miss Faith she is a hangel sir but Miss Dolly I fere no better than she ort to be , and wonderful fond of been noticed . I see her keeping company and carryin on dreadful with a tall dark young man as meens no good and lives to Widow Shankses . Too nites running when the days was short she been up to the cornder of your grounds to meat he there ever so long . Only you hask her if you do n't believe me and wash her fase same time sir . Too other peple besides me nose it . Excoose hon'd sir this trubble from your obejiant servant "
108243	108515	108241	108241	MISSTAKE	496	" The Admiral 's healthy face turned blue with rage and contempt , and he stamped with his heel , as if he had the writer under it . To write a stabbing letter , and to dare to deal the stab , and yet fear to show the hand that deals it , was at that time considered a low thing to do . Even now there are people who so regard it , though a still better tool for a blackguard the anonymous post - card is now superseding it . All the old man 's pleasure , and cheer , and comfort , and joy in having one day at home at last , were dashed and shattered and turned into wretched anxiety by this vile scrawl . He meant to have gone down , light of heart , with a smiling daughter upon either arm , to the gallant little festival where everybody knew him , and every one admired and loved him . His two pretty daughters would sit upstairs , watching from a bow - window though themselves unseen all the dashing arrivals and the grand apparel . Then when the Marquis made his speech , and the King and Queen and Royal Family rode upon the clouds , and the grandeur of Great Britain was above the stars of heaven , the ladies in the gallery would venture just to show themselves , not for one moment with a dream of being looked at , but from romantic loyalty , and the fervour of great sentiments . People pretending not to know would ask , "
108523	108740	108743	108743	father	7004	" And he would make believe to know nothing at all about it , but his heart would know whether he knew it or not . On the very eve of all this well - earned bliss , when it would have refreshed his fagged body and soul which were now not so young as they used to be to hear from some scoundrel without a name , that his pet child , the life of his life , was no better than she ought to be , which being said of a woman means that she is as bad as she can be ! This fine old gentleman had never received such a cowardly back - handed blow till now , and for a moment he bent under it . Then , greatly ashamed of himself , he arose , and with one strong word , which even Mr. Twemlow might have used under such provocation , he trod the vile stuff under foot , and pitched it with the fire - tongs into the fire . After this he felt better , and resolving most stoutly that he never would let it cross his mind again , made a light and cheerful answer to the profligate one his young girl who came seeking him . "
108752	108756	108743	108743	father	7004	" she cried . "
108848	108849	108837	108837	I	0	" "
108859	108884	108837	108837	I	0	" said the father , gently fingering but half afraid to look at her , because of what had been in his own mind ; "
108945	108946	108949	108949	papa	6834	" "
109020	109021	109011	109011	you	6834	" "
109032	109053	109023	109023	you	3265	" said he , being carried beyond his usual state by the joy in her eyes as she touched him . "
109102	109169	109100	109100	yourself	6834	" She swept all her breast - knots away anyhow that had taken an hour to arbitrate and flung back her hair that would never be coiled , and with a flash of tears leaping into laughing eyes , threw both arms round her father 's neck , and pressed her cool sweet lips to his , which were not at all in the same condition . "
109181	109185	109100	109100	yourself	6834	" she cried . "
109250	109251	109252	109252	I	0	" "
109261	109273	109258	109259	Eliza Twemlow	293	" the Admiral exclaimed , with a snap of his thumb . "
109364	109398	109403	109403	papa	6834	" Dolly looked at her father , as if there were no other man in the world for the moment . Then her conscience made her bright eyes fall , as she whispered : "
109466	109467	109460	109460	you	6834	" "
109472	109492	109460	109460	you	6834	" cried the simple old father , as the girl tripped away in hot haste to seek for it ; "
109531	109532	109525	109525	I	0	" "
109536	109553	109525	109525	I	0	" he continued to himself , as Miss Dolly ran away , to repair her damages ; "
109604	110065	109593	109593	I	0	" And truly there seemed to be no reason why all the guests at that great festival , save those who had speeches to make , should not enjoy their evening thoroughly . Great preparations had been made , and goodly presents contributed ; plenty of serving - men would be there , and John Prater now growing white - headed and portly was becoming so skilful a caterer that if anything was suggested to him , he had always thought of it long ago . The only grief was that the hour should be so late five o'clock , an unchristian time , as they said , for who could have manners after starving so long ? There was some sense in this ; but the unreasonable lateness of the hour could not be helped , because the Lord - Lieutenant had to wait upon the King at eight o'clock that morning . That he could do so , and yet be in Springhaven by five , seemed almost impossible ; for only ten years ago the journey took two days . But the war seemed to make everything go quicker , and it was no use to wonder at anything . Only if everything else went quicker , why should dinner the most important of them all come slower ? And as yet there was nobody to answer this ; though perhaps there is no one to ask it now . All things began very beautifully . The young ladies slipped in unobserved , and the elder blessings of mankind came after , escorting themselves with dignity . Then the heroes who had fought , and the gallants who had not had the luck yet , but were eager for it , came pleasantly clanking in , well girt to demolish ox and sheep , like Ajax , in lack of loftier carnage . The rector said grace , and the Marquis amen , and in less than two minutes every elbow was up , and every mouth at business . There was very little talking for the first half hour . In those days emptiness was not allowed to make the process of filling a misery . While these fine fellows were still in the prime of their feeding , bent over and upon it , two men with empty stomachs , and a long way between them and their victuals , stood afar regarding them . That is to say , just far enough to be quite out of sight from the windows , in the gloom of the December evening ; but at the same time near enough , to their own unhappiness , to see and even smell the choice affairs across the road . "
110077	110104	110072	110072	thou	3285	" the shorter man sharply asked the tall one , both being in an uncomfortable place in a hedge , and with briars that scratched them . "
110169	110170	110171	110172	My friend	6556	" "
110174	110180	110171	110172	My friend	6556	" said the tall man , "
110318	110319	110330	110334	the wicked self - command	3290	" "
110394	110395	110402	110402	you	6556	" "
110435	110467	110479	110479	you	6556	" and here the tall man whispered into the ear of his brisk companion , who danced with delight in the ungenial hedge , till his face was scarred with brambles . "
110514	110515	110518	110518	Charron	403	" "
110520	110527	110518	110518	Charron	403	" said the tall stern man , "
110724	110725	110712	110712	I	0	" "
110747	110748	110753	110754	my friend	6556	" "

110916	110917	110919	110919	he	3308	" "
110981	111346	111347	111347	Gentlemen	3310	" About half an hour after this , the Lord - Lieutenant having hammered on the table with an empty bottle , stood up to propose the chief toast of the evening the gallant crew of the Leda , and the bold sailors of Springhaven . His lordship had scarcely had a bottle and a half , and was now in the prime of his intellect . A very large man , with a long brocaded coat of ruby - coloured cloth , and white satin breeches , a waistcoat of primrose plush emblazoned with the Union - jack then the popular device in gorgeous silks with a margin of bright gold , and a neckcloth pointed and plaited in with the rarest lace , worth all the rest put together what a pity it seemed that such a man should get drunk , or at any rate try so hard to do it . There was not a pimple on his face , his cheeks were rosy and glistening , but not flushed ; and his eyes were as bright and clear and deep as a couple of large sapphires . This nobleman said a few words , without any excitement , or desire to create it , every word to the point , and the best that could be chosen not to go beyond the point . There was no attempt at eloquence , and yet the speech was eloquent , because it suggested so much more than was said . More excitable natures , overcome by half a bottle , resolved to have the other half , in honour of that toast . Then the Marquis did a very kind and thoughtful thing , for which he deserved a bottle of the Royal Tokay , such as even Napoleon could not obtain . When the cheering was done , and every eye was fixed upon the blushing Scudamore who felt himself , under that fixture , like an insect under a lens which the sun is turning into a burning - glass the Chairman perceived his sad plight , and to give him more time and more spirit , rose again . "
111349	111353	111347	111347	Gentlemen	3310	" he said , "
111418	111499	111500	111501	BILLY BLUE	384	" Billy Blue , though almost forgotten now because the enemy would not fight him , the blockader of Brest , the hardy , skilful , and ever watchful Admiral Cornwallis , would be known to us nearly as well as Nelson , if fame were not a lottery . As the Lord - Lieutenant waved his hand , the company rose with one accord , and followed the lead of his strong clear voice in the popular song , called "
111502	111502	111500	111501	BILLY BLUE	384	"
111504	111569	111500	111501	BILLY BLUE	384	" ' Tis a terrible time for Englishmen ; All tyrants do abhor them ; Every one of them hath to fight with ten , And the Lord alone is for them . But the Lord hath given the strong right hand , And the courage to face the thunder ; If a Frenchman treads this English land , He shall find his grave thereunder .
111599	111668	111573	111576	the Ocean - Queen	3316	" They are mustering on yon Gallic coasts , You can see them from this high land , The biggest of all the outlandish hosts That ever devoured an island . There are steeds that have scoured the Continent , Ere ever one might say , ' Whoa , there ! ' And ships that would fill the Thames and Trent , If we would let them go there .
111700	111763	111673	111676	the Ocean - Queen	3316	" From the smiling bays of Devonshire To the frowning cliffs of Filey , Leaps forth every son of an English sire , To fight for his native isley . He hath drawn the sword of his father now From the rusty sheath it rattled in ; And Dobbin , who dragged the peaceful plough , Is neighing for the battle - din .
111797	111868	111775	111775	her	3319	" Then pledge me your English palm , my lad ; Keep the knuckles for Sir Frenchman ; No slave can you be till you change your dad , And no son of yours a henchman . The fight is to come ; and we will not brag , Nor expect whatever we sigh for , But stand as the rock that bears the flag Our duty is to die for .
111892	112069	112070	112071	That lad	3325	" What with the drum and the fifes of one of the regiments now at Stonnington , and the mighty bass of some sea - captains vehement in chorus , these rough and rolling lines were enough to frighten a thousand Frenchmen , while proving the vigour of British nerve , and fortitude both of heart and ear . When people have done a thing well , they know it , and applaud one another to include themselves ; and even the ladies , who were meant to be unseen , forgot that and waved their handkerchiefs . Then up and spoke Blyth Scudamore , in the spirit of the moment ; and all that he said was good and true , well - balanced and well - condensed , like himself . His quiet melodious voice went further than the Lord - Lieutenant 's , because it was new to the air of noise , and that fickle element loves novelty . All was silence while he spoke , and when he ceased great uproar . "
112075	112087	112092	112092	him	3325	" said the Marquis to his supporter on the right hand ; "
112154	112155	112133	112133	they	3326	" "
112167	112185	112161	112161	you	6653	" said the Admiral , who had made his way quietly from the bottom of the table . "
112246	112247	112220	112224	Vickers the Coast - guard	3329	" "
112300	112301	112293	112293	you	6653	" "
112373	112417	112361	112361	I	0	" The Lord - Lieutenant , with his cork just squeaking in the neck of the bottle , nodded ; and the Admiral , with officers crowding round , read aloud as follows , part being in type , and part in manuscript : "
112434	112457	112458	112459	BELLAMY DUDGEON	501	" French fleet standing in , must have slipped Cornwallis . Do all you can . Not a moment to lose . Signed "
112461	112462	112458	112459	BELLAMY DUDGEON	501	" "
112477	112485	112458	112459	BELLAMY DUDGEON	501	" said the Marquis , pouring carefully ; "
112534	112535	112537	112537	you	3339	" "
112553	112560	112547	112547	I	0	" the Admiral answered , quietly ; "
112624	112661	112665	112665	they	3342	" All the sons of the sea arose quietly , and were despatched with brief orders to the right and left , to communicate with their signal stations , while Stubbard hurried back to his battery . "
112669	112693	112694	112694	My	0	" whispered the Frenchman , who had returned with the author of the plot to watch the issue from a point of vantage . "
112766	112767	112769	112769	they	3342	" "
112771	112781	112782	112782	they	3342	" replied Carne , who was vexed , however ; "
112820	112821	112814	112814	we	3348	" "
112839	112844	112814	112814	we	3348	" cried the Frenchman . "
112866	112866	112814	112814	we	3348	"
113063	113165	113054	113054	she	277	" Dolly knew that she was quicker of wit than her sister as shallow waters run more rapidly and she fancied that she possessed a world of lively feelings into which the slower intellect could not enter . For instance , their elder brother Frank had just published a volume of poems , very noble in their way , and glowing with ardour for freedom , democracy , and the like , as well as exhibiting fine perception of sound , and great boldness in matters beyond sounding , yet largely ungifted with knowledge of nature , whether human or superior . "
113174	113193	113054	113054	she	277	" the Admiral had said , after singing out some of the rhyme of it to the tune of "
113196	113198	113054	113054	she	277	" ; "
113212	113316	113054	113054	she	277	" Faith had tried , as a matter of duty , to peruse this book to its cover ; but she found it beyond even her good - will , and mild sympathy with everything , to do so . There was not the touch of nature in it which makes humble people feel , and tickles even the very highest with desire to enter into it . So Faith declared that it must be very clever , and no doubt very beautiful , but she herself was so stupid that she could not make out very clearly what it was all about . "
113326	113336	113319	113319	I	0	" Miss Dolly cried , with a literary look . "
113476	113477	113467	113467	I	0	" "
113488	113492	113484	113484	I	0	" said Faith . "
113519	113611	113612	113612	Asteroid	505	" These poems were issued in one volume , and under one title The Harmodiad although there must have been some half - hundred of them , and not more than nine odes to freedom in the lot . Some were almost tolerable , and others lofty rubbish , and the critics not knowing the author spoke their bright opinions freely . The poet , though shy as a mouse in his preface , expected a mountain of inquiry as to the identity of this new bard , and modestly signed himself "
113614	115067	113612	113612	Asteroid	505	" which made his own father stare and swear . Growing sore prematurely from much keelhauling for the reviewers of the period were patriotic , and the English public anti - Gallic Frank quitted his chambers at Lincoln 's Inn , and came home to be comforted for Christmas . This was the wisest thing that he could do , though he felt that it was not Harmodian . In spite of all crotchets , he was not a bad fellow , and not likely to make a good lawyer . As the fates would have it being naturally hostile to poets who defy them , by the same coach to Stonnington came Master Johnny , in high feather for his Christmas holidays . Now these two brothers were as different of nature as their sisters were , or more so ; and unlike the gentler pair , each of these cherished lofty disdain for the other . Frank looked down upon the school - boy as an unlicked cub without two ideas ; the bodily defect he endeavoured to cure by frequent outward applications , but the mental shortcoming was beneath his efforts . Johnny meanwhile , who was as hard as nails , no sooner recovered from a thumping than he renewed and redoubled his loud contempt for a great lout over six feet high , who had never drawn a sword or pulled a trigger . And now for the winter this book would be a perpetual snowball for him to pelt his big brother with , and yet like a critic be scarcely fair object for a hiding . In season out of season , upstairs down - stairs , even in the breakfast and the dinner chambers , this young imp poked clumsy splinters worse than thorns , because so dull into the tender poetic side ; and people , who laugh at the less wit the better , laughed very kindly , to please the boy , without asking whether they vexed the man . And the worst of it was that the author too must laugh . All this might be looked down at by a soul well hoisted upon the guy - ropes of contempt ; and now and then a very solid drubbing given handsomely upon other grounds to the chief tormentor solaced the mind of unacknowledged merit . But as the most vindictive measure to the man who has written an abusive letter is to vouchsafe him no reply , so to the poet who rebukes the age the bitterest answer it can give is none . Frank Darling could retaliate upon his brother Johnny , and did so whenever he could lay hold of him alone ; but the stedfast silence of his sister Faith to whom one of his loftiest odes was addressed , and of his lively father , irked him far more than a thousand low parodies . Dolly alone was some comfort to him , some little vindication of true insight ; and he was surprised to find how quickly her intelligence which until now he had despised had strengthened , deepened , and enlarged itself . Still he wanted some one older , bigger , more capable of shutting up the mouth , and nodding instead of showing such a lot of red tongue and white teeth , before he could be half as snug as a true poet should be , upon the hobs of his own fire . And happily he found his Anti - Zoilus ere long . One day he was walking in a melancholy mood along the beach towards Pebbleridge , doubting deeply in his honest mind whether he ever should do any good , in versification , or anything else . He said to himself that he had been too sanguine , eager , self - confident , ardent , impetuous , and , if the nasty word must be faced , even too self - conceited . Only yesterday he had tried , by delicate setting of little word - traps , to lead Mr. Twemlow towards the subject , and obtain that kind - hearted man 's comforting opinion . But no ; the gentle Rector would not be brought to book , or at any rate not to that book ; and the author had sense enough to know without a wink that his volume had won volumes of dislike . Parnassus could never have lived till now without two heads one to carry on with , while the other is being thumped to pieces . While the critics demolish one peak , the poet withdraws to the other , and assures himself that the general public , the larger voice of the nation , will salute him there . But alas , Frank Darling had just discovered that even that eminence was not his , except as a desert out of human sight . For he had in his pocket a letter from his publishers , received that dreary morning , announcing a great many copies gone gratis , six sold to the trade at a frightful discount , and six to the enterprising public . All these facts combined to make him feel uncommonly sad and sore to - day . A man of experience could have told him that this disappointment was for his good ; but he failed to see it in that light , and did not bless the blessing . Slowly and heavily he went on , without much heed of anything , swinging his clouded cane now and then , as some slashing reviews occurred to him , yet becoming more peaceful and impartial of mind under the long monotonous cadence and quiet repetitions of the soothing sea . For now he was beyond the Haven head the bulwark that makes the bay a pond in all common westerly weather and waves that were worthy of the name flowed towards him , with a gentle breeze stepping over them . The brisk air was like a fresh beverage to him , and the fall of the waves sweet music . He took off his hat , and stopped , and listened , and his eyes grew brighter . Although the waves had nothing very distinct to say in dying , yet no two if you hearkened well , or at any rate no two in succession , died with exactly the same expression , or vanished with precisely the same farewell . Continual shifts went on among them , and momentary changes ; each in proper sequence marching , and allowed its proper time , yet at any angle traversed , even in its crowning curl , not only by the wind its father , but by the penitent return and white contrition of its shattered elder brother . And if this were not enough to make a samely man take interest in perpetually flowing changes , the sun and clouds , at every look and breath , varied variety . Frank Darling thought how small his griefs were , and how vain his vanity . Of all the bubbly clots of froth , or frayed and shattered dabs of drift , flying beside him or falling at his feet , every one was as good as his ideas , and as valuable as his labours . And of all the unreckoned waves advancing , lifting their fugitive crests , and roaring , there certainly was not one that fell with weight so futile as his own . Who cared even to hear his sound ? What ear was soothed by his long rhythm , or what mind solaced by the magnitude of his rolling ? Suddenly he found that some mind was so . For when he had been standing a long while thus , chewing the salt cud of marine reflections , he seemed to hear something more intelligible than the sea . With more surprise than interest he walked towards the sound , and stood behind the corner of a jutting rock to listen . In another second his interest overpowered his surprise , for he knew every word of the lines brought to his ears , for the very simple reason that they were his own . Round the corner of that rock , so absorbed in admiration that he could hear no footstep , a very fine young man of the highest order was reading aloud in a powerful voice , and with extremely ardent gesticulation , a fine passage from that greatly undervalued poem , the Harmodiad , of and concerning the beauties of Freedom "
115149	115233	115234	115234	Frank	307	" Her blessings all may win who seek the prize , If only they be faithful , meek , and strong , And crave not that which others ' right denies , But march against the citadel of wrong . A glorious army this , that finds allies Wherever God hath built the heart of man With attributes that to Himself belong ; By Him ordained to crown what He began , And shatter despotism , which is the foul fiend 's ban .

115570	115573	115575	115576	Frank Darling	307	" Sir , "
115596	115625	115575	115576	Frank Darling	307	" excuse me for interrupting you , but this appears to be your hat , and it was on its way to a pool of salt - water . "
115626	115632	115634	115636	the other gentleman	3381	" Hat ! my hat ? "
115638	115721	115575	115576	Frank Darling	307	" Oh , to be sure ! I had quite forgotten . Sir , I am very much obliged to you . My hat might have gone to the devil , I believe , I was so delightfully occupied . Such a thing never happened to me before , for I am very hard indeed to please ; but I was reading , sir ; I was reading . Accept my thanks , sir ; and I suppose I must leave off . "
115722	115731	115733	115733	Frank	307	" I thought that I heard a voice , "
115768	115797	115747	115748	the other	893	" and I fear that I broke in upon a pleasant moment . Perhaps I should have pleased you better if I had left this hat to drown . "
115798	115803	115804	115805	the stranger	1556	" I seem ungrateful , "
115830	115888	115816	115816	he	1556	" but it is only because I have been carried far away from all thoughts of self , by the power of a much larger mind . Such a thing may have occurred to you , sir , though it happens very seldom in one life . If so , you will know how to forgive me . "
115889	115899	115901	115903	the anxious poet	3385	" I scarcely dare ask or rather I would say "
115904	115926	115816	115816	he	1556	" that I can not expect you to tell me the name of the fortunate writer who has moved you so . "
115927	115935	115937	115938	the other	893	" Would to Heaven that I could ! "
115940	116112	115937	115938	the other	893	" But this great poet has withheld his name all great poets are always modest but it can not long remain unknown . Such grandeur of conception and force of language , combined with such gifts of melody , must produce universal demand to know the name of this benefactor . I can not express myself as I would desire , because I have been brought up in France , where literature is so different , and people judge a work more liberally , without recourse to politics . This is a new work , only out last week ; and a friend of mine , a very fine judge of literature , was so enchanted with it that he bought a score of copies at once , and as my good stars prevailed , he sent me one . You are welcome to see it , sir . It is unknown in these parts ; but will soon be known all over Europe , unless these cruel wars retard it . "
116161	116170	116172	116173	the other	893	" You may not understand it at first , "
116175	116260	116172	116173	the other	893	" though I beg your pardon for saying that . What I mean is , that I can well suppose that an Englishman , though a good judge in general , would probably have his judgment darkened by insular prejudices , and the petty feeling which calls itself patriotism , and condemns whatever is nobler and larger than itself . My friend tells me that the critics have begun to vent their little spite already . The author would treat them with calm disdain ! "
116261	116266	116268	116268	Frank	307	" Horribly nasty fellows ! "
116270	116291	116268	116268	Frank	307	" They ought to be kicked ; but they are below contempt . But if I could only catch them here "
116292	116299	116301	116301	Carne	356	" I am delighted to find , "
116310	116337	116301	116301	Carne	356	" that you agree with me about that , sir . Read a few lines , and your indignation against that low lot will grow hotter . "
116338	116345	116347	116348	the author	9142	" It can not grow hotter , "
116350	116393	116347	116348	the author	9142	" I know every word that the villains have said . Why , in that first line that I heard you reading , the wretches actually asked me whether I expected my beautiful goddess to wear her crown upon her comely tail ! "
116394	116420	116268	116268	Frank	307	" I am quite at a loss to understand you , sir . Why , you speak as if this great work were your own ! "
116421	116431	116433	116433	Frank	307	" So it is , every word of it , "
116443	116519	116520	116521	Caryl Carne	356	" At least , I do n't mean that it is a great work though others , besides your good self , have said Are you sure that your friend bought twenty copies ? My publishers will have to clear up that . Why , they say , under date of yesterday , that they have only sold six copies altogether . And it was out on Guy Fawkes ' Day , two months ago ! "
116563	116572	116573	116573	he	356	" I can hardly help laughing at myself , "
116576	116622	116573	116573	he	356	" for being so stupid and so slow of mind . But a coincidence like this is enough to excuse anything . If I could be sure that you are not jesting with me , seeing how my whole mind is taken up with this book "
116623	116633	116635	116635	Frank	307	" Sir , I can feel for your surprise , "
116651	116724	116644	116645	the other	893	" because my own is even greater ; for I never have been read aloud before by anybody else I mean , of course ; and the sound is very strange , and highly gratifying at least , when done as you do it . But to prove my claim to the authorship of the little work which you so kindly esteem , I will show you the letter I spoke of . "
116755	116946	116747	116752	the fervent admirer of his genius	3391	" DEAR SIR , In answer to your favour to hand , we beg to state that your poetical work the Harmodiad , published by our firm , begins to move . Following the instructions in your last , we have already disposed of more than fifty copies . Forty - two of these have been distributed to those who will forward the interests of the book , by commending it to the Public ; six have been sold to the trade at a discount of 75 per cent . ; and six have been taken by private purchasers , at the full price of ten shillings . We have reason to anticipate a more rapid sale hereafter . But the political views expressed in the poems as we frankly stated to you at first are not likely to be popular just now , when the Country is in peril , and the Book trade incommoded , by the immediate prospect of a French invasion . We are , dear sir , your obedient servants , TICKLEBOIS , LATHERUP , BLINKERS , Co. To Mr. FRANK DARLING , Springhaven Hall . "
116947	116956	116958	116958	Frank	307	" You can not call that much encouragement , "
116960	117042	116958	116958	Frank	307	" and it is a most trusty and honourable house . I can not do what a friend of mine has done , who went to inferior publishers denounce them as rogues , and call myself a martyr . If the book had been good , it would have sold ; especially as all the poets now are writing vague national songs , full of slaughter and brag , like that ' Billy Blue ' thing all our fishermen are humming . "
117043	117097	116747	116752	the fervent admirer of his genius	3391	" You have nothing to do but to bide your time . In the long - run , fine work is sure to make its way . Meanwhile I must apologise for praising you to your face , in utter ignorance , of course . But it must have made you feel uncomfortable . "
117098	117106	117108	117110	the truthful Frank	307	" Not at all ; far otherwise , "
117112	117147	117108	117110	the truthful Frank	307	" It has been the very greatest comfort to me . And strange to say , it came just when I wanted it most sadly . I shall never forget your most kind approval . "
117148	117233	117234	117235	Frank Darling	307	" In that case I may take the liberty of introducing myself , I trust . You have told me who you are , in the most delightful way . I have no such claim upon your attention , or upon that of the world at large . I am only the last of an ill - fated race , famous for nothing except ruining themselves . I am Caryl Carne , of yonder ruin , which you , must have known from childhood . "
117257	117267	117268	117268	he	307	" I ought to have known who you are , "
117271	117407	117268	117268	he	307	" for I have heard of you often at Springhaven . But you have not been there since I came down , and we thought that you had left the neighbourhood . Our little village is like the ear of the tyrant , except that it carries more false than true sound . I hope you are come to remain among us , and I hope that we shall see you at my father 's house . Years ago I have heard that there used to be no especial good - will between your family and mine petty disputes about boundaries , no doubt . How narrow and ridiculous such things are ! We live in a better age than that , at any rate , although we are small enough still in many ways . "
117408	117420	117421	117421	Carne	356	" You are not ; and you will enlarge many others , "
117432	117465	117268	117268	he	307	" As for boundaries now , I have none , because the estates are gone , and I am all the richer . That is the surest way to liberate the mind . "
117466	117472	117474	117474	Frank	307	" Will you oblige me , "
117503	117563	117268	117268	he	307	" by looking along the shore towards Springhaven as far as you can see , and telling me whether any one is coming ? My sisters were to follow me , if the weather kept fine , as soon as they had paid a little visit at the rectory . And my sight is not good for long distances . "
117564	117696	117268	117268	he	307	" I think I can see two ladies coming , or at any rate two figures moving , about a mile or more away , where the sands are shining in a gleam of sunlight . Yes , they are ladies . I know by their walk . Good - bye . I have a way up the cliff from here . You must not be surprised if you do not see me again . I may have to be off for France . I have business there , of which I should like to talk to you . You are so far above mean prejudice . If I go , I shall carry this precious volume with me . Farewell , my friend , if I may call you so . "
117697	117703	117705	117708	the much admiring Frank	3393	" Do wait a minute , "
117710	117765	117705	117708	the much admiring Frank	3393	" or walk a few yards with me towards Springhaven . It would give me such pleasure to introduce you to my sisters . And I am sure they will be so glad to know you , when I tell them what I think . I very seldom get such a chance as this . "
117766	117773	117775	117777	the graceful Carne	356	" There is no resisting that ! "
117779	117813	117775	117777	the graceful Carne	356	" I have not the honour of knowing a lady in England , except my aunt Mrs. Twemlow , and my cousin Eliza both very good , but to the last degree insular . "
117814	117847	117852	117855	these two young men	3394	" It is very hard to help being that , when people have never been out of an island . But I fear that I am taking you out of your way . "
117917	117932	117911	117911	her	511	" Why , Mr. Carne saved both our lives only a few days ago . "
118086	118100	118101	118101	he	332	" Oh , he is a fine judge of poetry , is he ? "
118111	118145	118101	118101	he	332	" that means , I suppose , that he admires yours , Frank . Remember what Nelson said about you . The longer I live , the more I find his views confirmed . "
118146	118160	118162	118162	Dolly	511	" Papa , you are too bad ! You are come home cross ! "
118172	118201	118162	118162	Dolly	511	" What does my godfather know of poetry , indeed ? If he ever had any ear for it , the guns would have ruined it long ago . "
118202	118209	118211	118212	the master	1020	" No mostacchio in my house ! "
118218	118284	118211	118212	the master	1020	" I believe that is the correct way to pronounce the filthy thing a foreign abomination altogether . Who could keep his lips clean , with that dirt over them ? A more tolerant man than myself never lived a great deal too tolerant , as everybody knows . But I 'll never tolerate a son of mine in disgusting French hairiness of that sort . "
118285	118298	118300	118300	Dolly	511	" Papa , you are come home as cross as a bear ! "
118307	118348	118300	118300	Dolly	511	" Lord Dashville was here the other day with a very nice one , and I hear that all Cavalry Officers mean to have one , when they can . And Mr. Carne , Frank 's friend , encourages it . "
118349	118412	118438	118438	Dolly	511	" The less you have to say about that young man , the better . And the less he has to say to any child of mine , the better , both for him and her , I say . I know that the age is turned upside down . But I 'll not have that sort of thing at my table . "
118498	118508	118510	118511	the Admiral	747	" I very seldom speak harshly , my boy , "
118531	118552	118554	118554	he	747	" and when I do so you may feel quite certain that there is sound reason at the bottom of it "
118563	118747	118554	118554	he	747	" It is not only that I am not myself , because of the many hours spent upon hard leather , and vile chalks of flint that go by me half asleep , when I ought to be snoring in the feathers ; neither has it anything to do with my consuming the hide of some quadruped for dinner , instead of meat . And the bread is made of rye , if of any grain at all ; I rather think of spent tan , kneaded up with tallow ends , such as I have seen cast by in bushels , when the times were good . And every loaf of that costs two shillings one for me , and one for Government . They all seem to acknowledge that I can put up with that ; and I make a strict point of mild language , which enables them to do it again with me . And all up and down the roads , everybody likes me . But if I was shot to - morrow , would they care twopence ? "
118748	118765	118767	118767	Frank	307	" I am sure they would , sir ; and a good deal more than that , "
118800	118825	118554	118554	he	747	" I am sure that there is nobody in Sussex , Kent , or Hampshire who does not admire and respect and trust you . "
118826	119121	119140	119140	his	307	" I dare say , and rejoice to see me do the work they ought to do . They have long nights in bed , every one of them , and they get their meals when they want them . I am not at all astonished at what Nelson said . He is younger than I am by a good many years , but he seems to have picked up more than I have , in the way of common sentiments , and such like . ' You may do everybody 's work , if you are fool enough , ' he said to me the last time I saw him ; ' and ease them of their souls as well , if you are rogue enough , as they do in the Popish countries . I am nearly sick of doing it , ' he said , and he looked it . ' If you once begin with it , you must go on . ' I find it more true every day of my life . Do n't interrupt me ; do n't go on with comfortable stuff about doing good , and one 's duty towards one 's Country though I fear that you think very little of that . If I thought I had done good enough to make up for my back - aches , and three fine stumps lost through chewing patriotic sentiments , why , of course I should be thankful , and make the best of my reward . But charity begins at home , my boy , and one 's shirt should be considered before one 's cloak . A man 's family is the nearest piece of his country , and the dearest one . "
119122	119132	119134	119134	Frank	307	" I am sure , sir , I hope , "
119147	119186	119134	119134	Frank	307	" that nothing is going on amiss with us here . When you are away , I keep a sharp lookout . And if I saw anything going wrong , I should let you know of it immediately . "
119187	119213	119140	119140	his	307	" No doubt you would ; but you are much too soft . You are quite as easygoing as I used to be at your age "
119230	119695	119220	119220	he	747	" and that sort of thing will not do in these days . For my own discomforts I care nothing . I could live on lobscouse , or soap and bully , for a year , and thank God for getting more than I deserved . But my children , Frank , are very different . From me you would never hear a grumble , or a syllable of anything but perfect satisfaction , so long as I felt that I was doing good work , and having it appreciated . And all my old comrades have just the same feeling . But you , who come after us , are not like that . You must have everything made to fit you , instead of making yourselves fit them . The result will be , I have very little doubt , the downfall of England in the scale of nations . I was talking to my old friend St. Vincent last week , and he most heartily agreed with me . However , I do n't mean to blame you , Frank . You can not help your unfortunate nature for stringing ends of words together that happen to sound alike . Johnny will make a fine Officer , not in the Navy , but of Artillery Stubbard says that he has the rarest eyes he ever came across in one so young , and he wishes he could put them into his Bob 's head . He shall not go back to Harrow ; he can spell his own name , which seems to be all they teach them there , instead of fine scholarship , such as I obtained at Winton . But to spell his own name is quite enough for a soldier . In the Navy we always were better educated . Johnny shall go to Chatham , when his togs are ready . I settled all about it in London , last week . Nothing hurts him . He is water - proof and thunder - proof . Toss him up anyhow , he falls upon his feet . But that sort of nature very seldom goes up high . But you , Frank , you might have done some good , without that nasty twist of yours for writing and for rhyming , which is a sure indication of spinal complaint . Do n't interrupt me ; I speak from long experience . Things might be worse , and I ought to be thankful . None of my children will ever disgrace me . At the same time , things would go on better if I were able to be more at home . That Caryl Carne , for instance , what does he come here for ? "
119696	119850	119140	119140	his	307	" Well , sir , he has only been here twice . And it took a long time to persuade him at all . He said that as you had not called upon him , he felt that he might be intruding here . And Faith , who is sometimes very spiteful , bowed , as much as to say that he had better wait . But Dolly , who is very kind - hearted , assured him that she had heard you say at least a dozen times : ' Be sure that I call upon Mr. Carne to - day . What will he think of my neglect ? But I hope that he will set it down to the right cause the perpetual demands upon my time . ' And when she told him that , he said that he would call the next day , and so he did . "
119851	119854	119856	119858	the old man	1354	" Ah ! "
119864	119962	119856	119858	the old man	1354	" it was Dolly who took that little business off my shoulders ! She might have been content with her elder sister 's judgment , in a family question of that sort . But I dare say she thought it right to make my excuses . Very well , I 'll do that for myself . To - morrow I shall call upon that young man , unless I get another despatch to - night . But I hear he wants nobody at his ruins . I suppose he has not asked even you to go there ? "
119963	120007	119140	119140	his	307	" No , sir ; I think he took his little place here , because it would be so painful for him to receive any friends at that tumble - down castle . He has not yet been able to do any repairs . "
120008	120015	120017	120018	the Admiral	747	" I respect him for that , "
120026	120151	120017	120018	the Admiral	747	" they have been a grand old family , though I ca n't say much for those I knew except , of course , Mrs. Twemlow . But he may be a very fine young fellow , though a great deal too Frenchified , from all I hear . And why my friend Twemlow cold - shoulders him so , is something of a mystery to me . Twemlow is generally a judicious man in things that have nothing to do with the Church . When it comes to that , he is very stiff - backed , as I have often had to tell him . Perhaps this young man is a Papist . His mother was , and she brought him up . "
120152	120163	120165	120165	Frank	307	" I am sure I do n't know , sir , "
120167	120193	120165	120165	Frank	307	" I should think none the worse of him if he were , unless he allowed it to interfere with his proper respect for liberty . "
120194	120199	120201	120202	the Admiral	747	" Liberty be hanged ! "
120204	120420	120201	120202	the Admiral	747	" and that 's the proper end for most of those who prate about it , when they ought to be fighting for their Country . I shall sound him about that stuff to - morrow . If he is one of that lot , he wo n't come here with my good - will , I can assure him . What time is he generally to be found down there ? He is right over Stubbard 's head , I believe , and yet friend Adam knows nothing about him . Nor even Mrs. Adam ! I should have thought that worthy pair would have drawn any badger in the kingdom . I suppose the youth will see me , if I call . I do n't want to go round that way for nothing . I did want to have a quiet day at home , and saunter in the garden , as the weather is so mild , and consult poor Swipes about Spring crops , and then have a pipe or two , and take my gun to Brown Bushes for a woodcock , or a hare , and come home with a fine appetite to a good dinner . But I never must hope for a bit of pleasure now . "
120421	120430	120432	120432	Frank	307	" You may depend upon it , sir , "
120434	120510	120432	120432	Frank	307	" that Caryl Carne will be greatly pleased to see you . And I think you will agree with me that a more straightforward and simple - minded man is not to be found in this country . He combines what we are pleased to call our national dignity and self - respect with the elegant manners , and fraternal warmth , and bonhomie as they themselves express it of our friends across the water . "
120511	120606	120607	120608	Frank Darling	307	" You be off ! I do n't want to be cross any more . Two hundred thousand friends there at this moment eager to burn down our homes and cut our throats ! Tired as I am , I ought to take a stick to you , as friend Tugwell did to his son for much less . I have the greatest mind not to go near that young man . I wish I had Twemlow here to talk it over . Pay your fine for a French word , and be off ! "
120802	120805	120807	120808	the visitor	1457	" Susie , "
120827	120844	120807	120808	the visitor	1457	" I am come to see Mr. Carne , and I hope he is at home . "
120845	120855	120856	120858	the little girl	3434	" No , that ' a bain't , sir , "
120882	120899	120876	120876	her	3434	" he be gone away , sir ; and please , sir , mother said so . "
120900	121007	120856	120858	the little girl	3434	" Well , here 's a penny for you , my dear , because you are the best little needle - woman in the school , they tell me . Run and tell your mother to come and see me . Oh , Mrs. Shanks , I am very glad to see you , and so blooming in spite of all your hard work . Ah , it is no easy thing in these hard times to maintain a large family and keep the pot boiling . And everything clean as a quarter - deck ! My certy , you are a woman in a thousand ! "
121008	121088	120876	120876	her	3434	" No , sir , no . It is all the Lord 's doing . And you to the back of Him , as I alway say . Not a penny can they make out as I owes justly , bad as I be at the figures , Squire . Do ' e come in , and sit down , there 's a dear . Ah , I mind the time when you was like a dart , Squire ! "
121089	121102	121104	121105	the Admiral	747	" Well , and now I am like a cannon - ball , "
121115	121179	121104	121105	the Admiral	747	" only I do n't travel quite so fast as that . I scarcely get time to see any old friends . But I came to look out for a young friend now , the gentleman you make so comfortable upstairs . Do n't I wish I was a young man without incumbrance , to come and lodge with such a wonderful landlady ! "
121180	121418	120876	120876	her	3434	" Ah , if there was more of your sort , sir , there 'd be a deal less trouble in the world , there would . Not that my young gentleman is troublesome , mind you , only so full of them outlandish furrin ways abideth all day long without ating ort , so different from a honest Englishman . First I used to think as he could n't afford it , and long to send him up a bit of my own dinner , but dursn't for the life of me too grand for that , by ever so till one day little Susie there comes a - running down the stairs , and she sings out , with her face as red as ever a boiled lobster : ' Looky see , mother ! Oh , do ' e come and looky see ! Pollyon hath got a heap of guineas on his table ; would n't go into the big yellow pudding - basin ! ' And sure enough he had , your Honour , in piles , as if he was telling of them . He had slipped out suddenly , and thought the passage door was bolted . What a comfort it was to me , I ca n't configurate . Because I could eat my dinner comfortable now , for such a big heap of money never I did see . "
121419	121427	121429	121431	the smiling Admiral	3437	" I am very glad heartily glad , "
121433	121467	121429	121431	the smiling Admiral	3437	" I hope he may get cash enough to buy back all the great Carne property , and kick out those rascally Jews and lawyers . But what makes Susie call him that ? "
121468	121582	120876	120876	her	3434	" Well , sir , the young ones must have a nickname for anything beyond them ; and because he never takes any notice of them so different from your handsome Master Frank and some simility of his black horse , or his proud walk , to the pictur ' , ' Pollyon ' is the name they give him , out of Pilgrim 's Progress . Though not a bit like him , for such a gentleman to pay his rent and keep his place untroublesome I never had before . And a fortnight he paid me last night , afore going , and took away the keys of all three doors . "
121583	121702	121429	121431	the smiling Admiral	3437	" He is gone , then , is he ? To London , I dare say . It would be useless to look for him at the castle . My son will be disappointed more than I am . To tell you the truth , Mrs. Shanks , in these days the great thing is to stick to the people that we know . The world is so full , not of rogues , but of people who are always wanting something out of one , that to talk with a thoroughly kind , honest person , like yourself , is a real luxury . When the gentleman comes back , let him know that I have called . "
121703	121710	121712	121714	the anxious mother	3438	" And my Jenny , sir ? "
121723	121743	121712	121714	the anxious mother	3438	" not a word have you said about my Jenny . I hope she show no sign of flightiness ? "
121744	121753	121755	121756	the Admiral	747	" Jenny is as steady as the church , "
121758	121795	121755	121756	the Admiral	747	" We are going to put her on a pound a year from next quarter - day , by Mrs. Cloam 's advice . She 'll have a good stocking by the time she gets married . "
121796	121817	121823	121823	she	3442	" There never was such a pleasant gentleman , nor such a kind - hearted one , I do believe , "
121830	121849	121823	121823	she	3442	" What are they Carnes to the Darlings , after all ? As different as night and day . "
121928	121942	121943	121944	the Admiral	747	" Has the devil got hold of you at last , Jem Prater ? "
121966	121973	121975	121975	Jem	419	" For Parson ! for Parson ! "
121987	122007	121975	121975	Jem	419	" Butter Cheeseman hath hanged his self in his own scales . And nobody is any good but Parson . "
122014	122028	122029	122029	he	332	" What will the world come to ? I never knew such times , "
122217	122230	122232	122233	the Admiral	747	" Why do n't you cut him down , you old fools ? "
122263	122272	122274	122280	the quickest - witted of the gaffers	3456	" We was afraid of hurting of him , "
122282	122293	122295	122296	the deepest	3457	" Us wanted to know why ' a doed it , "
122300	122310	122312	122313	the wisest	3458	" The will of the Lord must be done , "
122438	122446	122398	122398	he	747	" it was all a mistake altogether . "
122516	122519	122520	122520	he	3467	" Sir , "
122553	122587	122520	122520	he	3467	" if anything has happened that had better not have been , it must have been by reason of the weight I give , and the value such a deal above the prices . "
122969	122973	123013	123013	they	3497	" little Boney . "
124292	124303	124305	124305	Napoleon	385	" You have done well on the whole very well , "
124323	124387	124305	124305	Napoleon	385	" You have kept me well informed ; you are not suspected ; you are enlarging your knowledge of the enemy and of his resources ; every day you become more capable of conducting us to the safe landing . For what , then , this hurry , this demand to see me , this exposing of yourself to the risk of capture ? "
124428	124714	124418	124418	his	3563	" Because you suppose that all is ripe . Because you believe that the slow beasts of islanders will strengthen their defences more by delay than we shall strengthen our attack . Because you are afraid of incurring suspicion , if you continue to prepare . And most of all , my friend , because you are impatient to secure the end of a long enterprise . But , Captain , it must be longer yet . It is not for you , but for me , to fix the time . Behold me ! I am come from a grand review . We have again rehearsed the embarkation . We have again put two thousand horses on board . The horses did it well ; but not the men . They are as brave as eagles , but as clumsy as the ostrich , and as fond of the sand without water . They will all be sea - sick . It is in their countenances , though many have been practised in the mouths of rivers . Those infamous English will not permit us to proceed far enough from our native land to acquire what they call the legs of the sea . If our braves are sea - sick , how can they work the cannon , or even navigate well for the accursed island ? They must have time . They must undergo more waves , and a system of diet before embarkation . Return , my trusted Captain , and continue your most esteemed services for three months . I have written these new instructions for you . You may trust me to remember this addition to your good works . "
124846	124858	124859	124859	he	356	" All shall be done to your orders , my General , "
124864	124991	124859	124859	he	356	" For my own position I have no fear . I might remain there from year to year without any suspicion arising , so stupid are the people all around , and so well is my name known among them . The only peril is in the landing of stores , and I think we should desist from that . A few people have been wondering about that , though hitherto we have been most fortunate . They have set it down so far to smuggling operations , with which in that tyrannical land all the lower orders sympathise . But it would be wiser to desist awhile , unless you , my General , have anything of moment which you still desire to send in . "
124992	125001	125003	125003	Napoleon	385	" What sort of fellow is that Sheeseman ? "
125012	125028	125003	125003	Napoleon	385	" Is he more to be confided in as a rogue or as a fool ? "
125029	125070	124859	124859	he	356	" As both , sir ; but more especially as a rogue , though he has the compunctions of a fool sometimes . But he is as entirely under my thumb , as I am under that of my Commander . "
125071	125077	125088	125088	his	525	" That is very good , "
125092	125243	125088	125088	his	525	" and at an hour 's notice , with fifty chosen men landed from the London Trader ah , I love that name ; it is appropriate you could spike all the guns of that pretentious little battery , and lock the Commander of the Coast - Defence in one of his own cellars . Is it not so , my good Captain ? Answer me not . That is enough . One question more , and you may return . Are you certain of the pilotage of the proud young fisherman who knows every grain of sand along his native shore ? Surely you can bribe him , if he hesitates at all , or hold a pistol at his ear as he steers the leading prame into the bay ! Charron would be the man for that . Between you and Charron , there should be no mistake . "
125244	125294	124859	124859	he	356	" He requires to be handled with much delicacy . He has no idea yet what he is meant to do . And if I understand his nature , neither bribes nor fear would move him . He is stubborn as a Breton , and of that simple character . "
125295	125309	125311	125311	Napoleon	385	" One can always befool a Breton ; but I hate that race , "
125313	125339	125311	125311	Napoleon	385	" If he can not be made useful , tie a round shot to him , throw him overheard , and get a gentler native . "
125340	125354	125356	125356	Carne	356	" Alas , I fear that we can not indulge in that pleasure , "
125364	125423	125356	125356	Carne	356	" It cost me a large outlay of skill to catch him , and the natives of that place are all equally stubborn . But I have a plan for making him do our work without being at all aware of it . Is it your wish , my General , that I should now describe that plan ? "
125424	125428	125430	125430	Napoleon	385	" Not now , "
125440	125602	125603	125605	The great man	1634	" but in your next letter . I start for Paris in an hour 's time . You will hear of things soon which will add very greatly to the weight and success of this grand enterprise . We shall have perfidious Albion caught in her own noose , as you shall see . You have not heard of one Captain Wright , and the landing - place at Biville . We will have our little Biville at Springhaven . There will be too many of us to swing up by a rope . Courage , my friend ! The future is with you . Our regiments are casting dice for the fairest English counties . But your native county is reserved for you . You shall possess the whole of it I swear it by the god of war and command the Southern army . Be brave , be wise , be vigilant , and above all things be patient . "
125641	125645	125646	125646	he	356	" My Emperor ! "
125649	125653	125646	125646	he	356	" my Emperor ! "
125654	125661	125663	125663	Napoleon	385	" Wait until the proper time , "
125672	125695	125663	125663	Napoleon	385	" You are not the first , and you will not be the last . Observe discretion . Farewell , my friend ! "
126241	126716	126735	126735	Carne	356	" It is the dread of the English seaman , it is the fame of Nelson , it is the habit of being beaten when England meets them upon the sea nothing else keeps this mighty host like a set of trembling captives here , when they might launch forth irresistibly . And what is a great deal worse , it will keep me still in my ruined dungeons , a spy , an intriguer , an understrapper , when I am fit to be one of the foremost . What a fool I am so to be cowed and enslaved , by a man no better endowed than myself with anything , except self - confidence ! I should have looked over his head , and told him that I had had enough of it , and if he would not take advantage of my toils , I would toil for him no longer . Why , he never even thanked me , that I can remember , and my pay is no more than Charron 's ! And a pretty strict account I have to render of every Republican coin he sends . He will have his own head on them within six months , unless he is assassinated . His manners are not those of a gentleman . While I was speaking to him , he actually turned his back upon me , and cleared his throat ! Every one hates him as much as fears him , of all who are in the rank of gentlemen . How would it pay me to throw him over , denounce my own doings , excuse them as those of a Frenchman and a French officer , and bow the knee to Farmer George ? Truly if it were not for my mother , who has sacrificed her life for me , I would take that course , and have done with it . Such all - important news would compel them to replace me in the property of my forefathers ; and if neighbours looked coldly on me at first , I could very soon conquer that nonsense . I should marry little Dolly , of course , and that would go half - way towards doing it . I hate that country , but I might come to like it , if enough of it belonged to me . Aha ! What would my mother say , if she dreamed that I could have such ideas ? And the whole of my life belongs to her . Well , let me get back to my ruins first . It would never do to be captured by a British frigate . We had a narrow shave of it last time . And there will be a vile great moon to - night . "
127044	127054	127059	127059	he	356	" None of your risky tricks to - night ! "
127113	127160	127182	127182	he	1854	" You will just make straight , as the tide and shoals allow , for our usual landing - place , set me ashore , and follow me to the old quarters . I have orders to give you , which can be given only there . "
127161	127169	127182	127182	he	1854	" My commanding officer shall be obeyed , "
127203	127217	127193	127193	he	1854	" but I fear that he has not found things to his liking . "
127218	127249	127250	127254	The light - hearted Frenchman	3634	" What concern is that of yours ? Your duty is to carry out my orders , to the utmost of your ability , and offer opinion when asked for . "
127259	127266	127267	127267	he	1854	" My commanding officer is right , "
127270	127341	127267	127267	he	1854	" but the sea is getting up , and there will be wind , unless I mistake the arising of the moon . My commanding officer had better retire , until his commands are needed . He has been known to feel the effects of high tossing , in spite of his unequalled constitution . Is it not so , my commander ? I ask with deference , and anxiety . "
127381	127391	127376	127376	He	356	" Try to keep me out of rough water , "
127440	127453	127461	127461	he	403	" We shall have some game , and a fine game too , "
127469	127530	127461	127461	he	403	" Milord gives himself such mighty airs ! We will take him to the cross - run off the Middle Bank , and offer him a basin through the key - hole . To make sea - sick an Englishman for , after all , what other is he ? will be a fine piece of revenge for fair France . "
127564	127601	127541	127541	she	3637	" he was one of they folk as seems to go about their business , and do their jobs , and keep their skins as full as other people , without putting nort inside of them . "
127899	127902	127904	127904	Charron	403	" General , "
127931	128060	127904	127904	Charron	403	" it would afford us pleasure if you would kindly come on deck and give us the benefit of your advice . I fear that you are a little confined down here , and in need of more solid sustenance . My General , arise ; there is much briskness upon deck , and the waves are dancing beautifully in the full moon . Two sail are in sight , one upon the weather bow , and the other on the weather quarter . Ah , how superior your sea - words are to ours ! If I were born an Englishman , you need not seek far for a successor to Nelson , when he gets shot , as he is sure to be before very long . "
128061	128065	128067	128077	Carne , whose troubles were faintly illuminated by a sputtering wick	3650	" Get out ! "
128079	128104	128067	128077	Carne , whose troubles were faintly illuminated by a sputtering wick	3650	" Get out , you scoundrel , as you love plain English . Go direct to the devil only let me die in peace . "
128105	128120	128122	128123	the Frenchman	1854	" All language is excusable in those affected with the malady of the sea , "
128133	128259	128122	128123	the Frenchman	1854	" Behold , if you would get up and do this , you would be as happy inside as I am . But stay I know what will ease you in an instant , and enable you to order us right and left . The indefatigable Sherray put a fine piece of fat pork in store before we sailed ; I have just had it cooked , for I was almost starving . It floats in brown liquor of the richest order , such as no Englishman can refuse . Take a sip of pure rum , and you will enjoy it surely . Say , my brave General , will you come and join me ? It will cure any little disquietude down here . "
128328	128338	128340	128340	Charron	403	" I wish you could eat a little bit , "
128353	128396	128345	128345	Carne	357	" Well , you 'll be worse before you are better , as the old women say in your country . But what am I to do about the two British ships for they are sure to be British now in sight ? "
128422	128431	128433	128433	Charron	403	" This is going a little too far , "
128435	128457	128433	128433	Charron	403	" I must have some orders , my commander . You understand that two English ships are manifestly bearing down upon us "
128458	128473	128474	128475	his commander	3544	" Let them come and send us to the bottom the sooner the better , "
128495	128516	128517	128518	the Frenchman	1854	" But I am not ready to go to the bottom , nor all the other people of our fourteen hands "
128524	128627	128517	128518	the Frenchman	1854	" neither will I even go to prison . I will do as they do at Springhaven , and doubtless at every other place in England . I will have my dish of pork , which is now just crackling I am capable of smelling it even here and I will give some to Sam Polwhele , and we will put heads together over it . To outsail friend Englishman is a great delight , and to out - gun him would be still greater ; but if we can not accomplish those , there will be some pleasure of outwitting him . "
128944	128955	128957	128957	Charron	403	" Carry on as we are for about ten minutes , "
128965	128989	128962	128963	Sam Polwhele	421	" that will give us period to eat our pork . Come , then , my good friend , let us do it . "
129083	129089	129092	129092	he	403	" No fear of me ! "
129095	129135	129092	129092	he	403	" You keep out of sight , because of your twang . I 'll teach them a little good English better than ever came out of Cornwall . The best of all English is not to say too much . "
129200	129236	129239	129239	him	357	" Aha ! We have done well . We have warmed our wits up . One glass of what you call the grog ; and then we will play a pleasant game with those Englishmen ! "
129335	129341	129343	129343	Polwhele	421	" All clear for stays ! "
129350	129372	129343	129343	Polwhele	421	" Down helm ! Helm 's alee ! Steady so . Let draw ! Easy ! easy ! There she fills ! "
129405	129411	129413	129413	Polwhele	421	" Uncommon quick in stays ! "
129427	129436	129413	129413	Polwhele	421	" Wonder what Britishers will think of that ? "
129541	129557	129559	129560	Master Polwhele	538	" Nonplussed the big ' un ; shall have trouble with the little ' un , "
129565	129597	129559	129560	Master Polwhele	538	" She do n't draw half a fathom more than we do . No good running inside the shoals . And with this wind , she has the foot of us . "
129598	129610	129611	129611	Charron	403	" Bear straight for her , and let her board us , "
129616	129737	129611	129611	Charron	403	" Down with all French hands into the forepart of the hold , and stow the spare foresail over them . Show our last bills of lading , and ask them to trade . You know all about Cheeseman ; double his prices . If we make any cash , we 'll divide it . Say we are out of our course , through supplying a cruiser that wanted our goods for nothing . I shall keep out of sight on account of my twang , as you politely call it . The rest I may safely leave to your invention . But if you can get any ready rhino , Sam Polwhele is not the man to neglect it . "
129738	129743	129745	129746	the Yankee	3696	" Bully for you ! "
129764	129840	129745	129746	the Yankee	3696	" There 's five ton of cheeses that have been seven voyages , and a hundred firkins of Irish butter , and five - and - thirty cases of Russian tongues , as old as old Nick , and ne'er a sign of weevil ! Lor ' no , never a tail of weevil ! Skipper , you deserve to go to heaven out of West Street . But how about him , down yonder ? "
129841	129925	129935	129936	the American	3698	" Captain Carne ? Leave him to me to arrange . I shall be ready , if they intrude . Announce that you have a sick gentleman on board , a passenger afflicted with a foreign illness , and having a foreign physician . Mon Dieu ! It is good . Every Englishman believes that anything foreign will kill him with a vault . Arrange you the trading , and I will be the doctor a German ; I can do the German . "
129926	129934	129935	129936	the American	3698	" And I can do the trading , "
129946	129965	129935	129936	the American	3698	" any fool can sell good stuff ; but it requireth a good man to sell bad goods . "
130071	130080	130091	130091	she	3694	" Heave to , or we sink you ! "
130165	130177	130179	130182	the officer in command	3711	" We have no wish to put you to any trouble , "
130187	130263	130179	130182	the officer in command	3711	" if you can show that you are what you profess to be . You sail under British colours ; and the name on your stern is London Trader . We will soon dismiss you , if you prove that . But appearances are strongly against you . What has brought you here ? And why did you run the risk of being fired at , instead of submitting to his Majesty 's ship Minerva ? "
130264	130286	130288	130290	the tall Bostonian	3712	" Because she have n't got any ready money , skipper , and we do n't like three months ' bills , "
130299	130370	130288	130290	the tall Bostonian	3712	" Such things is nothing but piracy , and we had better be shot at than lose such goods as we carry fresh shipped , and in prime condition . Come and see them , all with Cheeseman 's brand , the celebrated Cheeseman of Springhaven name guarantees the quality . But one thing , mind you no use to hanker after them unless you come provided with the ready . "
130371	130383	130385	130385	Scudamore	429	" We do n't want your goods ; we want you , "
130412	130461	130402	130402	his	429	" That is to say , our duty is to know all about you . Produce your papers . Prove where you cleared from last , and what you are doing here , some thirty miles south of your course , if you are a genuine British trader . "
130462	130562	130288	130290	the tall Bostonian	3712	" Papers all in order , sir . First - chop wafers , as they puts on now , to save sealing - wax . Charter - party , and all the rest . Last bills of lading from Gravesend , but you must n't judge our goods by that . Bulk of them from St. Mary Axe , where Cheeseman hath freighted from these thirty years . If ever you have been at Springhaven , Captain , you 'd jump at anything with Cheeseman 's brand . But have you brought that little bag of guineas with you ? "
130563	130610	130688	130690	an eminent physician	3719	" Once more , we want none of your goods . You might praise them as much as you liked , if time permitted . Show me to the cabin , and produce your papers . After that we shall see what is in the hold . "
130611	130652	130655	130655	his	3716	" Supercargo very ill in best cabin . Plague , or black fever , the German doctor says . None of our hands will go near him but myself . But you wo n't be like that , will you ? "
130681	130684	130685	130685	His	3716	" zymotic . "
130733	130741	130742	130742	he	3716	" Fly , my boy , fly , "
130749	130758	130742	130742	he	3716	" if you ever come near such subjects . "
130759	130767	130769	130770	Mr. Polwhele	538	" Captain , I will fetch them , "
130778	130909	130769	130770	Mr. Polwhele	538	" By good rights they ought to be smoked , I dare say , though I do n't hold much with such stuff myself . And the doctor keeps doing a heap of herbs hot . You can see him , if you just come down these few steps . Perhaps you would n't mind looking into the hold , to find something to suit your judgment quality combined with low figures there while I go into the infected den , as the cleverest of my chaps calls it . Why , it makes me laugh ! I 've been in and out , with this stand - up coat on , fifty times , and you ca n't smell a flue of it , though wonderful strong down there . "
130981	130989	130990	130990	he	429	" Ca n't find all of them , "
131004	131039	130990	130990	he	429	" That doctor goes on as bad as opening a coffin . Says he understands it , and I do n't . The old figure - head ! What does he know about it ? "
131040	131049	131051	131051	Blyth	429	" Much more than you do , perhaps , "
131066	131085	131051	131051	Blyth	429	" Perhaps we had better look at these on deck , if you will bring up your lantern . "
131086	131131	130990	130990	he	429	" But , Captain , you will have a look at our hold , and make us a bid we need not take it , any more than you need to double it for as prime a lot of cheese , and sides of bacon "
131132	131163	130990	130990	he	429	" If your papers are correct , it will not be my duty to meddle with your cargo . But what are you doing the wrong side of our fleet ? "
131164	131277	131051	131051	Blyth	429	" Why , that was a bad job . There 's no fair trade now , no sort of dealing on the square nohow . We run all this risk of being caught by Crappos on purpose to supply British ship Gorgeous , soweastern station ; and blow me tight if I could n't swear she had been supplied chock - full by a Crappo ! Only took ten cheeses and fifteen sides of bacon , though she never knew nought of our black fever case ! But , Captain , sit down here , and overhaul our flimsies . Not like rags , you know ; do n't hold plague much . "
131325	131331	131332	131332	he	2153	" They seem all right , "
131335	131368	131332	131332	he	2153	" but one thing will save any further trouble to both of us . You belong to Springhaven . I know most people there . Have you any Springhaven hands on board ? "
131369	131428	131332	131332	he	2153	" I should think so . Send Tugwell aft ; pass the word for Dan Tugwell . Captain , there 's a family of that name there settled as long as we have been at Mevagissey . Ah , that sort of thing is a credit to the place , and the people too , in my opinion . "
131559	131562	131564	131564	Scudamore	429	" Daniel , "
131594	131612	131584	131584	he	429	" are you here of your own accord , as one of the crew of this schooner ? "
131650	131705	131645	131645	he	282	" I fear I have been bamboozled . I have cast my lot in with these fellows through passion , and in hasty ignorance . How I should like to go with you , and fight the French , instead of getting mixed up with a lot of things I ca n't make out ! "
131715	131780	131707	131707	his	282	" You have been well treated . You are well paid . You shipped of your own accord . You have no right to peach , even if you had anything to peach of ; and all you have seen is some queer trading . None but a sneak would turn against his shipmates and his ship , when overhauled by the Royal Navy . "
131821	131855	131856	131856	Scudamore	429	" Are you here of your own accord ? Do you belong to this schooner of your own accord ? Are you one of this crew , of your own free - will ? "
131908	131916	131917	131917	he	429	" Do you eat with your eyes ? "
131935	131940	131942	131942	Dan	282	" S'pose I am , "
131953	131968	131942	131942	Dan	282	" yes , sir , I come aboard of my own free - will . "
131969	132001	131942	131942	Dan	282	" Very well . Then I am glad to find you comfortable . I shall see your father next week , perhaps . Shall I give him any message for you ? "
132002	132047	132102	132102	his	429	" No , sir ! For God 's sake , do n't let him know a word about where you have seen me . I came away all of a heap , and I do n't want one of them to bother about me . "
132048	132099	132102	132102	his	429	" As you wish , Dan . I shall not say a word about you , until you return with your earnings . But if you found the fishing business dull , surely you might have come to us , Dan . Any volunteers here for His Majesty 's service ? "
132110	132142	132102	132102	his	429	" Good pay , good victuals , fine promotion , and prize - money , with the glory of fighting for their native country , and provision for life if disabled ! "
133109	133120	133122	133123	the Earl	3775	" The man that floated her shall float in her , "
133142	133169	133122	133123	the Earl	3775	" He has seen sharp service , and done sharp work . It is waste of time to talk of it ; the job is done . "
133170	133178	133180	133181	the other	893	" Job is the word for it , "
133586	133595	133596	133597	Blyth Scudamore	429	" How lovely everything is to - day ! "
133620	133630	133617	133618	Dolly Darling	277	" No wonder that your brother is a poet ! "
133631	133642	133644	133644	Dolly	277	" But he never writes about this sort of thing , "
133649	133692	133644	133644	Dolly	277	" His poems are all about liberty , and the rights of men , and the wrongs of war . And if he ever mentions cows or sheep , it is generally to say what a shame it is to kill them . "
133693	133785	133617	133618	Dolly Darling	277	" But surely it is much worse to kill men . And who is to be blamed for that , Miss Darling ? The Power that wants to overrun all the rest , or the Country that only defends itself ? I hope he has not converted you to the worship of the new Emperor ; for the army and all the great cities of France have begged him to condescend to be that ; and the King of Prussia will add his entreaties , according to what we have heard . "
133786	133793	133795	133795	Dolly	277	" I think anything of him ! "
133806	134054	133795	133795	Dolly	277	" After all his horrible murders worst of all of that very handsome and brave young man shot with a lantern , and buried in a ditch ! I was told that he had to hold the lantern above his poor head , and his hand never shook ! It makes me cry every time I think of it . Only let Frank come back , and he wo n't find me admire his book so very much ! They did the same sort of thing when I was a little girl , and could scarcely sleep at night on account of it . And then they seemed to get a little better , for a time , and fought with their enemies , instead of one another , and made everybody wild about liberty , and citizens , and the noble march of intellect , and the dignity of mankind , and the rights of labour when they would n't work a stroke themselves and the black superstition of believing anything , except what they chose to make a fuss about themselves . And thousands of people , even in this country , who have been brought up so much better , were foolish enough to think it very grand indeed , especially the poets , and the ones that are too young . But they ought to begin to get wiser now ; even Frank will find it hard to make another poem on them . "
134055	134077	133799	133799	her	277	" How glad I am to hear you speak like that ! I had no idea at least I did not understand "
134078	134088	134090	134090	Dolly	277	" That I had so much common - sense ? "
134101	134132	134090	134090	Dolly	277	" Oh yes , I have a great deal sometimes , I can assure you . But I suppose one never does get credit for anything , without claiming it . "
134133	134149	134168	134168	he	429	" I am sure that you deserve credit for everything that can possibly be imagined , "
134173	134211	134168	134168	he	429	" Every time I see you I find something I had never found before to to wonder at if you can understand and to admire , and to think about , and to to be astonished at . "
134411	134419	134420	134420	she	277	" I am not at all ambitious , "
134439	134476	134420	134420	she	277	" but how I wish I could do something to deserve even half that you say of me ! But I fear that you find the air getting rather cold . The weather is so changeable . "
134477	134487	134420	134420	she	277	" Are you sure that you are not ambitious ? "
134514	134568	134587	134587	her	277	" You have every right to be ambitious , if such a word can be used of you , who are yourself the height of so many ambitions . It was the only fault I could imagine you to have , and it seems too bad that you should have none at all . "
134569	134578	134580	134580	Dolly	277	" You do n't know anything about it , "
134598	134625	134587	134587	her	277	" I am not only full of faults , but entirely made up of them . I am told of them too often not to know . "
134626	134634	134587	134587	her	277	" By miserably jealous and false people . "
134647	134724	134587	134587	her	277	" By people who can not have a single atom of perception , or judgment , or even proper feeling . I should like to hear one of them , if you would even condescend to mention it . Tell me one only one if you can think of it . I am not at all a judge of character , but but I have often had to study it a good deal among the boys . "
134776	134783	134784	134784	She	277	" You do say such things ! "
134805	134824	134799	134799	she	277	" Things that nobody else ever says . And that is one reason why I like you so . "
134825	134849	134790	134790	she	277	" Oh , do you like me do you like me in earnest ? I can hardly dare to dream even for one moment "
134850	134910	134790	134790	she	277	" I am not going to talk about that any more . I like Mr. Twemlow , I like Captain Stubbard , I like old Tugwell though I should have liked him better if he had not been so abominably cruel to his son . Now I am sure it is time to go and get ready for dinner . "
134911	134925	134927	134929	the young man	861	" Ah , when shall I dine with you again ? Perhaps never , "
134941	134984	134927	134929	the young man	861	" But I ought to be very happy , on the whole , to think of all the pleasures I have enjoyed , and how much better I have got on than I had any right in the world to hope for . "
134985	135019	134790	134790	she	277	" Yes , to be the Commander of a beautiful ship , little more than a year from the date of your commission . Captain Stubbard is in such a rage about it ! "
135020	135152	134927	134929	the young man	861	" I do n't mean about that though that of course is rare luck I mean a much more important thing ; I mean about getting on well with you . The first time I saw you in that fine old school , you did not even want to shake hands with me , and you thought what a queer kind of animal I was ; and then the first time or two I dined at the Hall , nothing but fine hospitality stopped you from laughing at my want of practice . But gradually , through your own kind nature , and my humble endeavours to be of use , I began to get on with you better and better ; and now you are beginning almost to like me . "
135153	135160	135161	135161	she	3803	" Not almost , but altogether , "
135170	135207	135161	135161	she	3803	" I can tell you there are very few , outside of my own family , that I like half so well as I like you . But how can it matter to you so much ? "
135255	135265	135266	135266	she	3803	" We are all so sorry to lose you . "
135269	135500	135266	135266	she	3803	" and no one will miss you so much as I shall , because we have had such pleasant times together . But if we can carry out our little plot , we shall hear of you very often , and I dare say not very unfavourably . Faith and I have been putting our heads together , and for our own benefit , and that of all the house , if we can get you to second it . My father jumped at the idea , and said how stupid we were not to think of it before . You know how very little he can be at home this summer , and he says he has to sacrifice his children to his country . So we suggested that he should invite Lady Scudamore to spend the summer with us , if she can be persuaded to leave home so long . We will do our very utmost to make her comfortable , and she will be a tower of strength to us ; for you know sometimes it is very awkward to have only two young ladies . But we dare not do anything until we asked you . Do you think she would take compassion upon us ? A word from you perhaps would decide her ; and Faith would write a letter for you to send . "
135511	135524	135525	135525	he	3807	" How can I thank you ? I had better not try , "
135551	135608	135525	135525	he	3807	" You are almost as clever as you are good ; you will know what I mean without my telling you . My mother will be only too glad to come . She knows what you are , she has heard so much from me . And the reality will put to shame all my descriptions . "
135609	135645	135266	135266	she	3803	" Tell me what you told her I was like . The truth , now , and not a word of afterthought or flattery . I am always so irritated by any sort of flattery . "
135646	135760	135525	135525	he	3807	" Then you must let me hold your hands , to subdue your irritation ; for you are sure to think that it was flattery you are so entirely ignorant of yourself , because you never think of it . I told my dear mother that you were the best , and sweetest , and wisest , and loveliest , and most perfect , and exquisite , and innocent , and unselfish of all the human beings she had ever seen , or heard , or read of . And I said it was quite impossible for any one after one look at you to think of himself any more in this world . "
135761	135765	135767	135767	Dolly	277	" Well done ! "
135786	135929	135767	135767	Dolly	277	" It is as well to do things thoroughly , while one is about it . I can understand now how you get on so fast . But , alas , your dear mother will only laugh at all that . Ladies are so different from gentlemen . Perhaps that is why gentlemen never understand them . And I would always a great deal rather be judged by a gentleman than a lady . Ladies pick such a lot of holes in one another , whereas gentlemen are too large - minded . And I am very glad upon the whole that you are not a lady , though you are much more gentle than they make believe to be . Oh dear ! We must run ; or the ladies will never forgive us for keeping them starving all this time . "
135936	135949	135951	135952	Mr. Twemlow	299	" Not that there is anything to make one so very uneasy , "
135954	136250	135951	135952	Mr. Twemlow	299	" only that one has a right to know the meaning of what we are expected to put up with . Nothing is clear , except that we have not one man in the Government who knows his own mind , or at any rate dares to pronounce it . Addington is an old woman , and the rest oh , when shall we have Pitt back again ? People talk of it , and long for it ; but the Country is so slow . We put up with everything , instead of demanding that the right thing shall be done at once . Here is Boney , a fellow raised up by Satan as the scourge of this island for its manifold sins ; and now he is to be the Emperor forsooth not of France , but of Europe , continental Europe . We have only one man fit to cope with him at all , and the voice of the nation has been shouting for him ; but who pays any attention to it ? This state of things is childish simply childish ; or perhaps I ought to say babyish . Why , even the children on the sea - shore know , when they make their little sand walls against the tide , how soon they must be swept away . But the difference is this , that they do n't live inside them , and they have n't got all that belongs to them inside them . Nobody must suppose for a moment that a clergyman 's family would fail to know where to look for help and strength and support against all visitations ; but , in common with the laity , we ask for Billy Pitt . "
136251	136261	136263	136264	Captain Stubbard	391	" And in another fortnight you will have him , "
136273	136337	136263	136264	Captain Stubbard	391	" Allow me to tell you a little thing that happened to my very own self only yesterday . You know that I am one of the last people in the world to be accused of any what 's the proper word for it ? Mrs. Stubbard , you know what I mean Jemima , why the deuce do n't you tell them ? "
136338	136353	136355	136356	his wife	6501	" Captain Stubbard always has more meaning than he can well put into words , "
136358	136375	136355	136356	his wife	6501	" his mind is too strong for any dictionary . Hallucination is the word he means . "
136376	136379	136381	136382	the Captain	1173	" Exactly ! "
136384	136613	136381	136382	the Captain	1173	" That expresses the whole of what I wanted to say , but went aside of it . I am one of the last men in the world to become the victim of any there , I 've lost it again ! But never mind . You understand now ; or if you do n't , Mrs. Stubbard will repeat it . What I mean is that I see all things square , and straight , and with their own corners to them . Well , I know London pretty well ; not , of course , as I know Portsmouth . Still , nobody need come along with me to go from Charing Cross to St. Paul 's Church - yard ; and pretty tight I keep all my hatches battened down , and a sharp pair of eyes in the crow's - nest for to have them in the foretop wo n't do there . It was strictly on duty that I went up the duty of getting a fresh stock of powder , for guns are not much good without it ; and I had written three times , without answer or powder . But it seems that my letters were going the rounds , and would turn up somewhere , when our guns were stormed , without a bit of stuff to make answer . "
136614	136626	136628	136629	Mr. Twemlow	299	" Ah , that 's the way they do everything now ! "
136631	136674	136628	136629	Mr. Twemlow	299	" I thought you had been very quiet lately ; but I did not know what a good reason you had . We might all have been shot , and you could not have fired a salute , to inform the neighbourhood ! "
136675	136681	136683	136684	the Captain	1173	" Well , never mind , "
136688	136898	136683	136684	the Captain	1173	" I am not complaining , for I never do so . Young men might ; but not old hands , whose duty it is to keep their situation in life . Well , you must understand that the air of London always makes me hungry . There are so many thousands of people there that you ca n't name a time when there is nobody eating , and this makes a man from the country long to help them . Anyhow , I smelled roast mutton at a place where a little side street comes up into the Strand ; and although it was scarcely half past twelve , it reminded me of Mrs. Stubbard . So I called a halt , and stood to think upon a grating , and the scent became flavoured with baked potatoes . This is always more than I can resist , after all the heavy trials of a chequered life . So I pushed the door open , and saw a lot of little cabins , right and left of a fore and aft gangway , all rigged up alike for victualling . Jemima , I told you all about it . You describe it to the Rector and Mrs. Twemlow . "
136899	136908	136910	136911	the host	1358	" Do n't let us trouble Mrs. Stubbard , "
136913	136934	136910	136911	the host	1358	" I know the sort of thing exactly , though I do n't go to that sort of place myself . "
136935	137193	136683	136684	the Captain	1173	" No , of course you do n't . And I was a little scared at first , for there was sawdust enough to soak up every drop of my blood , if they had pistolled me . Mrs. Twemlow , I beg you not to be alarmed . My wife has such nerves that I often forget that all ladies are not like her . Now do n't contradict me , Mrs. Stubbard . Well , sir , I went to the end of this cockpit if you like to call it so and got into the starboard berth , and shouted for a ration of what I had smelled outside . And although it was far from being equal to its smell as the character is of everything you might have thought it uncommon good , if you had never tasted Mrs. Stubbard 's cooking , after she had been to the butcher herself . Very well . I do n't care for kickshaws , even if I could afford them , which has never yet been my destiny . So I called for another ration of hot sheep beg your pardon , ladies , what I mean is mutton and half a dozen more of baked potatoes ; and they reminded me of being at home so much that I called for a pint of best pine - apple rum and a brace of lemons , to know where I was to remind me that I was n't where I could n't get them . "
137194	137199	137201	137202	Mrs. Stubbard	393	" Oh , Adam ! "
137204	137235	137201	137202	Mrs. Stubbard	393	" what will you say next ? Not on weekdays , of course , but nearly every Sunday and the samples of his powder in his pocket , Mr. Twemlow ! "
137236	137401	137201	137202	Mrs. Stubbard	393	" Jemima , you are spoiling my story altogether . Well , you must understand that this room was low , scarcely higher than the cabin of a fore - and - after , with no skylights to it , or wind - sail , or port - hole that would open . And so , with the summer coming on , as it is now though a precious long time about it and the smell of the meat , and the thoughts of the grog , and the feeling of being at home again , what did I do but fall as fast asleep as the captain of the watch in a heavy gale of wind ! My back was to the light , so far as there was any , and to make sure of the top of my head , I fetched down my hat the soft - edged one , the same as you see me wear on fine Sundays . "
137553	137715	137525	137528	a pair of Frenchmen	3815	" Some wiseacre says that listeners never hear good of themselves , and upon my word he was right enough this time , so far as I made out . The French language is beyond me , so far as speaking goes , for I never can lay hold of the word I want ; but I can make out most of what those queer people say , from being a prisoner among them once , and twice in command of a prize crew over them . And the sound of my own name pricked me up to listen sharply with my one good ear . You must bear in mind , Rector , that I could not see them , and durst not get up to peep over the quarter - rail , for fear of scaring them . But I was wearing a short hanger , like a middy 's dirk the one I always carry in the battery . "
137716	137728	137729	137730	Mrs. Stubbard	393	" I made Adam promise , before he went to London , "
137736	137766	137729	137730	Mrs. Stubbard	393	" that he would never walk the streets without steel or firearms . Portsmouth is a very wicked place indeed , but a garden of Eden compared with London . "
137767	137772	137774	137775	Captain Stubbard	391	" Well , sir , "
137777	138372	137774	137775	Captain Stubbard	391	" the first thing I heard those Frenchmen say was : ' Stoobar is a stupid beast , like the ox that takes the prize up here , except that he has no claim to good looks , but the contrary wholly the contrary . ' Mrs. Stubbard , I beg you to preserve your temper ; you have heard others say it , and you should now despise such falsehoods . ' But the ox has his horns , and Stoobar has none . For all his great guns there is not one little cup of powder . ' The villains laughed at this , as a very fine joke , and you may well suppose that I almost boiled over . ' You have then the command of this beast Stoobar ? ' the other fellow asked him , as if I were a jackass . ' How then have you so very well obtained it ? ' ' In a manner the most simple . Our chief has him by the head and heels : by the head , by being over him ; and by the heels , because nothing can come in the rear without his knowledge . Behold ! you have all . ' ' It is very good , ' the other villain answered ; ' but when is it to be , my most admirable Charron ? how much longer ? how many months ? ' ' Behold my fingers , ' said the one who had abused me ; ' I put these into those , and then you know . It would have been already , except for the business that you have been employed upon in this black hole . Hippolyte , you have done well , though crookedly ; but all is straight for the native land . You have made this Government appear more treacherous in the eyes of France and Europe than our own is , and you have given a good jump to his instep for the saddle . But all this throws us back . I am tired of tricks ; I want fighting ; though I find them quite a jolly people . ' ' I do n't , ' said the other , who was clearly a low scoundrel , for his voice was enough to settle that ; ' I hate them ; they are of thick head and thick hand , and would come in sabots to catch their enemy asleep . And now there is no chance to entangle any more . Their Government will be of the old brutal kind , hard knocks , and no stratagems . In less than a fortnight Pitt will be master again . I know it from the very best authority . You know what access I have . ' ' Then that is past , ' the other fellow answered , who seemed to speak more like a gentleman , although he was the one that ran down me ; ' that is the Devil . They will have their wits again , and that very fat Stoobar will be supplied with powder . Hippolyte , it is a very grand joke . Within three miles of his head which is empty , like his guns we have nearly two hundred barrels of powder , which we fear to bring over in those flat - bottoms for fear of a volley among them . Ha ! ha ! Stoobar is one fine fat ox ! ' "

138592	138596	138563	138573	the sort of fellow who would do so in these days	3826	" said the Rector "

138705	138720	138752	138752	ma'am	6642	" Mrs. Stubbard 's right to spare nobody was well established by this time . "

138754	138759	138752	138752	ma'am	6642	" replied Mr. Twemlow ; "

138917	138939	138900	138900	ma'am	6642	" cried the Captain of the battery , having now well manned his own portholes with the Rector 's sound wine ; "

139290	139325	139283	139283	Hearken	553	" the veteran cried , as he patted his waistcoat a better one than he could have worn , and a larger one than he could have wanted , except for the promised invasion . "
139390	139391	139377	139377	I	0	" "
139398	139407	139396	139396	Captain	7734	" said the Rector , in good spirits . "

139668	139669	139653	139653	I	0	" "
139678	139683	139674	139674	you	0	" Mr. Twemlow answered . "
139726	139726	139705	139715	A man who works as hard as you and I do	3892	"
140231	140255	140256	140256	he	541	" I have a great mind to go to Mr. Pitt myself , tell him everything , and throw myself upon his generosity , "
140267	140634	140256	140256	he	541	" I could not be brought to trial as a common traitor . Although by accident of birth I am an Englishman , I am a French officer , and within my duty in acting as a pioneer for the French army . But then , again , they would call me at the best a spy , and in that capacity outside the rules of war . It is a toss - up how they might take it , and the result would depend perhaps on popular clamour . The mighty Emperor has snubbed me . He is not a gentleman . He has not even invited me to Paris , to share in the festivities and honours he proclaims . I would risk it , for I believe it is the safer game , except for two obstacles , and both of those are women . Matters are growing very ticklish now . That old bat of a Stubbard has got scent of a rat , and is hunting about the farm - houses . It would be bad for him if he came prowling here ; that step for inspectors is well contrived . Twenty feet fall on his head for my friend ; even his bull - neck would get the worst of that . And then , again , there is that wretch of a Cheeseman , who could not even hang himself effectually . If it were not for Polly , we would pretty soon enable him , as the Emperor enabled poor Pichegru . And after his own bona fide effort , who would be surprised to find him sus . per coll . ? But Polly is a nice girl , though becoming too affectionate . And jealous good lack ! a grocer 's daughter jealous , and a Carne compelled to humour her ! What idiots women are in the hands of a strong man ! Only my mother my mother was not ; or else my father was a weak one ; which I can well believe from my own remembrance of him . Well , one point at least shall be settled to - morrow . "
140864	140885	140886	140886	he	356	" If I had stuck to my proper line of work , in the Artillery , which has made his fortune "
140894	141064	140886	140886	he	356	" instead of losing more than a year over here , and perhaps another year to follow , and all for the sake of these dirty old ruins , and my mother 's revenge upon this country , I might have been a General by this time almost for nothing depends upon age in France and worthy to claim something lofty and grand , or else to be bought off at a truly high figure . The little gunner has made a great mistake if he thinks that his flat thumb of low breed can press me down shuddering , and starving , and crouching , just until it suits him to hold up a finger for me . My true course is now to consider myself , to watch events , and act accordingly . My honour is free to go either way , because he has not kept his word with me ; he promised to act upon my advice , and to land within a twelvemonth . "
141507	141511	141478	141478	he	356	" Universal Victualler , "
141568	141580	141581	141582	the children	810	" Oh , should n't I like a bit of that ? "
141642	141651	141690	141690	somebody	842	" the reason why ' a doed it . "
141813	141822	141824	141824	Dolly	277	" I am tired of all this fuss , "
141826	141872	141824	141824	Dolly	277	" one would think Queen Charlotte was coming , at the least ; and I dare say nearly all her luggage would go into the door - pocket . They are dreadfully poor ; and it serves them right , for being so dreadfully honest . "
141873	141881	141883	141883	Faith	315	" If you ever fall into poverty , "
141885	141965	141883	141883	Faith	315	" it will not be from that cause . When you get your money , you do n't pay your debts . You think that people should be proud to work for you for nothing . There is one house I am quite ashamed to pass by with you . How long have you owed poor Shoemaker Stickfast fifteen shillings and sixpence ? And you take advantage of him , because he dare not send it in to father . "
141966	141974	141975	141975	Dolly	277	" Fashionable ladies never pay their debts , "
142000	142058	141979	141979	she	277	" this is n't paid for , nor this , nor this ; and you with your slow head have no idea how it adds to the interest they possess . If I am not allowed to have a bit of fashion in my dress , I can be in the fashion by not paying for it . "
142059	142149	141883	141883	Faith	315	" It is a most happy thing for you , dear child , that you are kept under some little control . What you would do , I have not the least idea , if you were not afraid of dear father , as you are . The worst of it is that he is never here now for as much as two days together . And then he is so glad to see us that he can not attend to our discipline or take notice of our dresses . "
142150	142158	142160	142160	Dolly	277	" Ha ! you have inspired me ! "
142168	142301	142160	142160	Dolly	277	" The suggestion is yours , and I will act upon it . From the village of Brighthelmstone , which is growing very fine , I will procure upon the strictest credit a new Classic dress , with all tackle complete as dear father so well expresses it and then I will promenade me on the beach , with Charles in best livery and a big stick behind me . How then will Springhaven rejoice , and every one that hath eyes clap a spy - glass to them ! And what will old Twemlow say , and that frump of an Eliza , who condescends to give me little hints sometimes about tightening up SO , perhaps , and letting out so , and permitting a little air to come in HERE "
142302	142312	142314	142314	Faith	315	" Do be off , you wicked little animal ! "
142356	142393	142329	142329	Dolly	277	" you are wasting all my time , and doing worse with your own . Be off , or I 'll take a stick to ' e , as old Daddy Stakes says to the boys . "
142718	142752	142708	142708	she	277	" How absorbed we are in distant contemplation ! A happy sign , I hope , in these turbulent times . Miss Darling , will you condescend to include me in your view ? "
142753	142760	142762	142762	Dolly	277	" I only understand simple English , "
142764	142784	142708	142708	she	277	" Most of the other comes from France , perhaps . We believed that you were gone abroad again . "
142785	142797	142798	142798	Carne	356	" I wish that the subject had more interest for you , "
142820	142852	142802	142802	his	356	" My time is not like that of happy young ladies , with the world at their feet , and their chief business in it , to discover some new amusement . "
142853	142874	142708	142708	she	277	" You are not at all polite . But you never were that , in spite of your French education . "
142875	142926	142708	142708	she	277	" Ah , there it is again ! You are so accustomed to the flattery of great people that a simple - minded person like myself has not the smallest chance of pleasing you . Ah , well ! It is my fate , and I must yield to it . "
142927	142932	142934	142934	Dolly	277	" Not at all , "
142956	142979	142953	142954	Dan Tugwell	282	" There is no such thing as fate for a strong - willed man , though there may be for poor women . "
142980	143024	143025	143025	Dolly	277	" May I tell you my ideas about that matter ? If so , come and rest for a moment in a quiet little shelter where the wind is not so cold . For there is no such thing as Spring in England . "
143095	143105	143106	143106	she	277	" Why , it is quite a little bower ! "
143109	143196	143106	143106	she	277	" as pretty a little nest as any bird could wish for . And what a lovely view towards the west and beyond Pebbleridge ! One could sit here forever and see the sun set . But I must have passed it fifty times without the least suspicion of it . How on earth have you managed to conceal it so ? That is to say , if it is your doing . Surely the children must have found it out , because they go everywhere . "
143197	143410	143411	143411	Dolly	277	" One brat did . But I gave him such a scare that he never stopped roaring till next Sunday , and it frightened all the rest from looking round that corner . If any other comes , I shall pitch - plaster him , for I could not endure that noise again . But you see , at a glance , why you have failed to see it , as we always do with our little oversights , when humbly pointed out to us . It is the colour of the ground and the background too , and the grayness of the scanty growth that hides it . Nobody finds it out by walking across it , because of this swampy place on your side , and the shoot of flints down from the cliff on the other , all sharp as a knife , and as rough as a saw . And nobody comes down to this end of the warren , neither is it seen from the battery on the hill . Only from the back is it likely to be invaded , and there is nothing to make people look , or come , up here . So you have me altogether at your mercy , Miss Darling . "
143602	143615	143621	143621	Dolly	277	" How clever he is , and how full of fine taste ! "
143623	143654	143621	143621	Dolly	277	" and all this time I have been taking him for a gloomy , hard - hearted , unnatural man . Blyth Scudamore never could have made this lovely bower . "
143748	143758	143759	143759	he	356	" I think I have done it pretty well , "
143770	143859	143759	143759	he	356	" with such scanty materials , I mean , of course . And I shall think I have done it very well indeed , if you say that you like it , and crown it with new glory by sitting for a moment in its unpretentious shade . If your brother comes down , as I hope he will , next week , I shall beg him to come and write a poem here . The place is fitter for a poet than a prosy vagabond like me . "
143860	143876	143877	143877	Dolly	277	" It is very hard that you should be a a wanderer , I mean , "
143890	143907	143877	143877	Dolly	277	" you have done nothing to deserve it . How unfairly fortune has always treated you ! "
143908	143997	143759	143759	he	356	" Fortune could make me a thousand times more than the just compensation even now , if she would . Such a glorious return for all my bitter losses and outcast condition , that I should but it is useless to think of such things , in my low state . The fates have been hard with me , but never shall they boast that they drove me from my pure sense of honour . Oh yes , it is damp . But let me cure it thus . "
144114	144129	144130	144130	she	277	" Oh , I am so sorry now ! Perhaps it will be spoiled , "
144133	144164	144130	144130	she	277	" for you say that the fates are against you always . And I am sure that they always combine against me , when I wear anything of that colour . "
144165	144175	144177	144177	Carne	356	" I am going the wrong way to work , "
144179	144192	144130	144130	she	277	" What a little vixen it is ; but what a beauty ! "
144280	144292	144293	144293	he	356	" But you must look at me and tell me something , "
144307	144337	144293	144293	he	356	" you shall tell me what my fate must be . Whether you can ever come to love me , as I have loved you , long and long . "
144338	144350	144351	144351	she	1315	" You have no right to speak to me like that , "
144366	144379	144293	144293	he	356	" no gentleman would think of taking advantage of a lady so . "
144380	144408	144293	144293	he	356	" I care not what is right or wrong . Look up , and tell me that you hate me . Dolly , I suppose you do . "
144409	144415	144416	144416	she	1315	" Then you are quite wrong "
144425	144452	144416	144416	she	1315	" no . I have always been so sorry for you , and for all your troubles . You must not ask me to say more . "
144453	144497	144293	144293	he	356	" But I must ; I must . That is the very thing that I must do . Only say that you love me , Dolly . Dolly darling , tell me that . Or let your lovely eyes say it for you . "
144498	144506	144416	144416	she	1315	" My lovely eyes must not tell stories "
144514	144526	144507	144507	they	3987	" and I do n't think I can say it yet . "
144527	144534	144535	144535	he	356	" But you will you shall ! "
144547	144575	144535	144535	he	356	" you shall not slip from me , you shall not stir , until you have answered me one question is there anybody else , my Dolly ? "
144576	144616	144507	144507	they	3987	" You frighten me . You forget who I am . Of course there are a great many else , as you call it ; and I am not to be called , for a moment , YOUR DOLLY . "
144617	144628	144535	144535	he	356	" No , not for a moment , but forever . "
144650	144699	144700	144700	Dolly	277	" Your little heart begins to know who loves it better than all the world put together . And for that reason I will leave you now . Farewell , my darling ; I conquer myself , for the sake of what is worth a thousand of it . "
144825	144836	144837	144837	she	277	" I should have let him I believe I should , "
144844	144882	144837	144837	she	277	" but how glad I ought to be that he did n't ! And I do hope he wo n't come back again . The next time I meet him , I shall sink into the earth . "
145164	145214	145119	145119	His	391	" Lay it on thick on the shutter , my son . Never mind about any other notices , except the one about young men wanted . No hurry ; keep your elbow up ; only do n't dab my breeches , nor the shirt you had on Sunday . "
145877	145888	145919	145920	Shotbury Down	188	" King and Queen , and their fifteen little ones . "
146016	146022	146024	146025	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" Do as you like , "
146030	146125	146024	146025	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" nothing as you do makes much differ to me now . If you feel you can be happy with them thousands of young men , and me without one left fit to lift a big crock , go your way , Zeb ; but you do n't catch me going , with the tears coming into my eyes every time I see a young man to remind me of Dan though there wo n't be one there fit to stand at his side . And him perhaps fighting against his own King now ! "
146126	146144	146024	146025	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" Whatever hath coom to Dannel is all along of your own fault , I tell ' e. "
146381	146394	146395	146396	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" What fault of mine , or of his , poor lamb ? "
146465	146494	146418	146418	her	463	" Was it I as colted him ? Or was it him as gashed himself , like the prophets of Baal , when ' a was gone hunting ? "
146495	146591	146418	146418	her	463	" No ; but you cockered him up , the same as was done to they , by the wicked king , and his wife the worst woman as ever lived . If they had n't gashed theirselves , I reckon , the true man of God would ' a done it for them , the same as he cut their throats into the brook Kishon . Solomon was the wisest man as ever lived , and Job the most patient the same as I be and Elijah , the Tishbite , the most justest . "
146592	146714	146418	146418	her	463	" You better finish up with all the Psalms of David , and the Holy Children , and the Burial Service . No more call for Parson Twemlow , or the new Churchwarden come in place of Cheeseman , because ' a tried to hang his self . Zebedee Tugwell in the pulpit ! Zebedee , come round with the plate ! Parson Tugwell , if you please , a - reading out the ten commandments ! But ' un ought to leave out the sixth , for fear of spoiling 's own dinner afterwards ; and the seventh , if ' a hopes to go to see King George the third , with another man 's woman to his elbow ! "
146715	146725	146418	146418	her	463	" When you begins to go on like that , "
146734	146761	146762	146762	He	278	" the only thing as a quiet man can do is to go out of houze , and have a half - pint of small ale . "
147333	147338	147340	147346	a fine young officer of the staff	4087	" They understand furze , "
147366	147426	147340	147346	a fine young officer of the staff	4087	" I doubt whether many of the Regular forces would have got through that brake half so well ; certainly not without double gaiters . If the French ever land , we must endeavour to draw them into furzy ground , and then set the Volunteers at them . No Frenchman can do much with prickles in his legs . "
147476	147526	147470	147470	Faith	315	" It is very kind of you , Lord Dashville , to say the best of us that you can find to say . But I fear that you are laughing to yourself . You know how well they mean ; but you think they can not do much . "
147527	147641	147642	147643	Miss Darling	277	" No , that is not what I think at all . So far as I can judge , which is not much , I believe that they would be of the greatest service , if the Country should unfortunately need them . Man for man , they are as brave as trained troops , and many of them can shoot better . I do n't mean to say that they are fit to meet a French army in the open ; but for acting on their flanks , or rear , or in a wooded country However , I have no right to venture an opinion , having never seen active service . "
147685	147694	147695	147695	he	4091	" How beautiful Springhaven must be looking now ! "
147711	147816	147695	147695	he	4091	" The cottages must be quite covered with roses , whenever they are not too near the sea ; and the trees at their best , full of leaves and blossoms , by the side of the brook that feeds them . All the rest of the coast is so hard and barren , and covered with chalk instead of grass , and the shore so straight and staring . But I have never been there at this time of year . How much you must enjoy it ! Surely we ought to be able to see it , from this high ground somewhere . "
147817	147829	147831	147831	Faith	315	" Yes , if you will ride to that shattered tree , "
147833	147874	147831	147831	Faith	315	" you will have a very fine view of all the valley . You can see round the corner of Foxhill there , which shuts out most of it just here . I think you have met our Captain Stubbard . "
147875	147891	147695	147695	he	4091	" Ah , I must not go now ; I may be wanted at any moment "
147914	147944	147831	147831	Faith	315	" and I fear that I could never see the roses there . I think there is nothing in all nature to compare with a rose except one thing . "
148043	148055	148056	148057	Mr. Swipes	309	" He knows to which side his bread will be buttered , "
148066	148155	148156	148159	This fine young woman	4097	" If ' a can only get Miss Faith , his bread 'll be buttered to both sides for life his self to one side , and her to do the tother . The same as I told Mother Cloam a man that knoweth his duty to head gardeners , as his noble lordship doth , the same know the differ atwixt Miss Faith as fine a young ' ooman as ever looked into a pink and that blow - away froth of a thing , Miss Dolly . "
148200	148237	148156	148159	This fine young woman	4097	" There is evidently something to be done directly . All the people are moving towards the middle of the down . We must not be so selfish as to keep you here , Lord Dashville . "
148238	148249	148251	148252	Miss Dolly	277	" Why , do n't you see what it is ? "
148262	148307	148251	148252	Miss Dolly	277	" they are going to have the grand march - past . These affairs always conclude with that . And we are in the worst part of the whole down for seeing it . Lord Dashville will tell us where we ought to go . "
148308	148318	148319	148319	he	309	" You had better not attempt to move now , "
148340	148513	148319	148319	he	309	" you might cause some confusion , and perhaps see nothing . And now I must discharge my commission , which I am quite ashamed of having left so long . His Majesty hopes , when the march - past is over , to receive a march - up of fair ladies . He has a most wonderful memory , as you know , and his nature is the kindest of the kind . As soon as he heard that Lady Scudamore was here , and Admiral Darling 's daughters with her , he said : ' Bring them all to me , every one of them ; young Scudamore has done good work , good work . And I want to congratulate his mother about him . And Darling 's daughters , I must see them . Why , we owe the security of the coast to him . ' And so , if you please , ladies , be quite ready , and allow me the honour of conducting you . "
148567	148649	148560	148563	the blunt old King	4103	" Monstrous ill - treated woman , shameful , left without a penny , after all her poor husband did for me and the children ! Not my fault a bit fault of the Whigs always stingy said he made away with himself bad example do n't believe a word of it ; very cheerful man . Blown by now , at any rate must see what can be done for her obliged to go for governess disgrace to the Crown ! "
148728	148918	148723	148725	that dowdy Faith	4106	" Is there time to drive back ? Is there time to drive home ? The King knows father , and he will be astonished to see a pair of frumps , and he wo n't understand one bit about the dust , or the sun that takes the colour out . He will think we have got all our best things on . Oh , Lady Scudamore , how could you do it ? You told us to put on quite plain things , because of the dust , and the sun , and all that ; and it might come to rain , you said as if it was likely , when the King was on the hill ! And with all your experience of the King and Queen , that you told us about last evening , you must have known that they would send for us . Gregory , how long would it take you to go home , at full gallop , allow us half an hour in the house , and be back here again , when all these people are gone by ? "
148919	148980	148997	148997	Dolly	277	" Well , miss , there be a steepish bit of road , and a many ockard cornders ; I should say ' a might do it in two hours and a half , with a fresh pair of nags put in while you ladies be a - cleaning of yourselves , miss . Leastways , if Hadmiral not object . "
148981	148996	148997	148997	Dolly	277	" Hadmiral , as you call him , would have nothing to do with it "
149016	149043	149044	149045	Coachman Gregory	349	" he has heavier duty than he can discharge . But two hours and a half is hopeless ; we must even go as we are . "
149416	149420	149421	149421	he	4117	" Thank God ! "
149426	149479	149421	149421	he	4117	" it 's all over now . My dear , you must be monstrous tired ; and scarcely a bit to eat all day . But I locked some in the seat - box this morning no trusting anybody but oneself . Let us get into the coach and have at them . "
149480	149487	149489	149490	the Queen	4125	" Ja , ja , meinherr , "
149492	149498	149489	149490	the Queen	4125	" If it please your Majesties "
149511	149524	149489	149490	the Queen	4125	" here are the ladies whose attendance I was ordered to require . "
149525	149531	149533	149534	King George	420	" Ladies ! what ladies ? "
149543	149581	149533	149534	King George	420	" Oh yes , to be sure ! I must n't get up so early to - morrow . Wo n't take a minute , my dear . Let them come . Not much time to spare . "
149660	149672	149674	149675	the King	6893	" Do n't cry , do n't cry , my dear , "
149686	149776	149674	149675	the King	6893	" we must bow to the will of the Lord , who gives sad trials to every one of us . We must think of the good , and not the evil . Bless me , keep your spirits up . Your son is doing very well indeed , very well indeed , from all I hear . Good chip of the old block , very good chip . Will cure my grandchildren , as soon as they want it ; and nobody is ever in good health now . "
149777	149808	149674	149675	the King	6893	" No , your Majesty , if you please , my son is in the Royal Navy , fighting for his Country and his King . And he has already captured "
149809	149992	149993	149993	His	4129	" Three French frigates . To be sure , I know . Better than curing three hundred people . Fine young officer very fine young officer . Must come to see me when he gets older . There , you are laughing ! That 's as it should be . Goodbye , young ladies . Forty miles to go tonight , and very rough roads very rough indeed . Monstrous pretty girls ! Uncommon glad that George was n't here to see them . Better stay in the country too good for London . Must be off ; sha'n't have a bit o ' sleep to - night , because of sleeping the whole way there , and then sure to be late in the morning , not a bit of breakfast till eight o'clock , and all the day thrown upside down ! Darlings , Darlings the right name for them ! But they must n't come to London . No , no , no . Too much wickedness there already . Very glad George was n't here to - day ! "
150261	150269	150253	150253	he	385	" left - handed and uncouth manoeuvres . "
150270	150336	150253	150253	he	385	" One of your Majesty 's feeblest regiments would send the whole of those louts to the devil ; and I am bound to impress once more , with all deference to your infallible judgment , the vast importance of carrying out your grand designs at the first moment . All is prepared on my part . One day 's notice is all I need . "
150912	150931	150933	150933	Carne	356	" I do not require production of your warrant . The whole place is open to your inspection , "
150944	151069	150933	150933	Carne	356	" open to all the winds and rains , and the lower part sometimes filled with water . The upper rooms , or rather the few that remain of them , are scarcely safe for a person of any weight to walk in , but you are most welcome to try them , if you like ; and this gentleman , I think , might not fall through . Here are my quarters ; not quite so snug as my little room at the widow 's ; but I can offer you some bread and cheese , and a glass of country cider . The vaults or cellars have held good wine in their time , but only empty casks and broken bottles now . "
151149	151159	151160	151160	he	391	" We will not keep you long , sir , "
151165	151218	151160	151160	he	391	" and if you are kind enough to show us the way , which is easily lost in a place of this kind , we shall be all the quicker . Wilkins , when you have done up there , wait here for us . Shall we want a light , sir ? "
151219	151294	151160	151160	he	391	" In the winter , you could hardly do without one , but at this time of year , I think you may . At any rate I will bring a lantern , and we can light it if wanted . But the truth is that I know next to nothing of those sepulchral places . They would not be very tempting , even without a ghost , which they are said to have . "
151295	151299	151301	151302	the Captain	1173	" A ghost ! "
151304	151338	151160	151160	he	391	" I do n't like that . Not that I have much faith in them ; although one never can be sure . But at this time of day What is it like ? "
151339	151442	151160	151160	he	391	" I have never seen her , and am quite content without it . It is said to be an ancestress of mine , a Lady Cordelia Carne , who was murdered , when her husband was away , and buried down there , after being thrown into the moat . The old people say that whenever her ghost is walking , the water of the moat bursts in and covers the floor of the vaults , that she may flit along it , as she used to do . But of course one must not listen to that sort of fable . "
151443	151483	151160	151160	he	391	" Perhaps you will go in front , sir , because you know the way . It is my duty to inspect these places ; and I am devilish sorry for it ; but my duty must be done . "
151484	151643	151644	151644	Carne	356	" You shall see every hole and corner , including the stone that was put up to commemorate her murder and keep her quiet . But I should explain that these vaults extend for the entire length of the building , except just in the middle , where we now stand . For a few yards the centre of the building seems to have never been excavated , as to which you will convince yourself . You may call the cellars east and west , or right and left , or north and south , or uphill and downhill , or anything else , for really they are so much alike , and partitioned into cells so much alike , that I scarcely know which is which myself , coming suddenly from the daylight . But you understand those things much better . A sailor always knows his bearings . This leads to the entrance of one set . "
151735	151744	151745	151746	the Captain	1173	" Are you sure this ladder is safe ? "
151759	151785	151745	151746	the Captain	1173	" My weight has increased remarkably in the fine air of Springhaven . If the bottom is rotten , the top wo n't help us . "
151786	151823	151835	151839	the brave yet prudent Stubbard	391	" Let me go first . It is my duty , as the owner ; and I have no family dependent on me . My neck is of no value , compared to yours , Captain . "
151824	151833	151835	151839	the brave yet prudent Stubbard	391	" How I have mistaken this young man ! "
151841	151878	151835	151839	the brave yet prudent Stubbard	391	" I called him a Frenchified fool , whereas he is a downright Englishman ! I shall ask him to dinner next week , if Jemima can get a new leg for the dripping - pan . "
151945	151950	151951	151951	he	4188	" Matter of form , "
151954	152024	151951	151951	he	4188	" matter of form , sir , when we know who people are ; but you might have to do it yourself , sir , if you were in the service of your King . You ought to be that , Mr. Carne ; and it is not too late , in such days as these are , to begin . Take my advice such a fine young man ! "
152025	152049	152056	152057	the Captain	1173	" Alas , my dear sir , I can not afford it . What officer can live upon his pay for a generation ? "
152050	152054	152056	152057	the Captain	1173	" Gospel truth ! "
152061	152144	152056	152057	the Captain	1173	" Gospel truth ! and more than that he must be the last of his generation , or else send his young ' uns to the workhouse . What things I could tell you , Mr. Carne ! But here we are at the end of the vaults ; all empty , as I can certify ; and I hope , my dear sir , that you may live to see them filled with good wine , as they used to be . "
152145	152184	152056	152057	the Captain	1173	" Thank you , but there is no hope of that . Shall we take the vaults of the other end next , or examine the chapel , and the outer buildings outer ruins , I should say ? "
152185	152198	152200	152201	the Captain	1173	" Oh , a little open air first , for goodness sake ! "
152210	152233	152200	152201	the Captain	1173	" I am pretty nearly choked with all this mildew . A little fresh air , before we undertake the other lot . "
152406	152410	152412	152412	Stubbard	391	" Rare stuff ! "
152420	152463	152412	152412	Stubbard	391	" Ah , I see that free - trade still exists . No concern of mine , except to enjoy its benefits . Here 's to your very good health , sir , and I am proud to have made your acquaintance . "
152464	152475	152476	152476	Carne	356	" Have another drop ; it can hurt no one , "
152484	152495	152496	152498	the official visitor	4204	" Well , I suppose we must finish our job , "
152503	152563	152496	152498	the official visitor	4204	" a matter of form , sir , and no offence ; but we are bound to carry out our duty . There is nothing left , except the other lot of vaults ; but the light begins to fail us , for underground work . I hope they are not so dark as those we have been through . "
152564	152603	152412	152412	Stubbard	391	" Just about the same . You would hardly know one set from the other , as I told you , except for the stone that records the murder . Perhaps we had better light the lantern now ? "
152604	152653	152496	152498	the official visitor	4204	" By all means . I do n't half like that story of the lady that walks on the water . It does seem so gashly and unchristian altogether . Not that I have any fear of ghosts not likely , for I have never even seen one . "
152654	152658	152660	152661	Gunner Bob	371	" I have , "
152677	152688	152660	152661	Gunner Bob	371	" I have , and a fearful one it were . "
152689	152698	152699	152700	the Captain	1173	" Do n't be a fool , Bob , "
152703	152746	152699	152700	the Captain	1173	" we do n't want to hear about that now . Allow me to carry the lantern , Mr. Carne ; it throws such shadows from the way you hold it . Why , surely , this is where we were before ! "
152747	152754	152755	152755	Carne	356	" You might easily fancy so , "
152760	152768	152755	152755	Carne	356	" especially with a mind at all excited "
152769	152795	152699	152700	the Captain	1173	" My mind is not excited , sir ; not at all excited ; but as calm as it ever was in all its life . "
152796	152823	152824	152824	he	356	" Then two things will show you that these are the other vaults . The arch is on your left hand , instead of on your right "
152837	152867	152868	152868	his	356	" and this entrance , as you see , has a door in it , which the other had not . Perhaps the door is to keep the ghost in "
152882	152929	152934	152934	he	356	" for this is the part she is supposed to walk in . But so much for the door ! The money - lenders have not left us a door that will stand a good kick . You may find our old doors in Wardour Street . "
152973	152988	152990	152990	Stubbard	391	" Why , bless my heart , there is a flood of water there ! "
153027	153071	152990	152990	Stubbard	391	" A flood of water , perhaps six feet deep ! I could scarcely have believed , but for that and the door , that these were not the very vaults that we have examined . But what business has the water there ? "
153072	153084	153085	153085	Carne	356	" No business at all , any more than we have , "
153108	153137	153105	153106	Captain Stubbard	391	" but I told you that the place becomes covered with water whenever the ghost intends to walk . Probably there is not more than a foot of water "
153145	153156	152990	152990	Stubbard	391	" and as you are bound to carry out your duty "
153157	153216	152990	152990	Stubbard	391	" My dear sir , I am satisfied , perfectly satisfied . Who could keep gunpowder under water , or even in a flooded cellar ? I shall have the greatest pleasure in reporting that I searched Carne Castle not of course suspiciously , but narrowly , as we are bound to do , in execution of our warrant "
153217	153228	153230	153230	Carne	356	" If you would not mind looking in this direction , "
153238	153276	153230	153230	Carne	356	" I think I could show you , just beyond the murder - stone yes , and it seems to be coming towards us , as white as a winding - sheet ; do come and look . "
153277	153289	153290	153291	the Captain	1173	" No , sir , no ; it is not my duty "
153302	153334	153290	153291	the Captain	1173	" I was sent here to look for saltpetre , not spectres . No officer in His Majesty 's service can be expected Bob , and Wilkins , are you there ? "
153335	153355	152990	152990	Stubbard	391	" Yes , sir , yes we have had quite enough of this ; and unless you give the orders "
153356	153365	153367	153367	Carne	356	" Here she comes , I do declare ! "
153373	153455	153367	153367	Carne	356	" Bob , and Wilkins , give me one arm each . Make for daylight in close order . You may be glad to see your grandmother , young man ; but I decline to have anything to say to her . Bob , and Wilkins , bear a hand ; I feel a little shaky in my lower timbers . Run for your lives , but do n't leave me behind . Run , lads , like the very devil ! "
153531	153543	153545	153545	Charron	403	" I think I did that pretty well , my Captain , "
153555	153588	153545	153545	Charron	403	" I deserve a glass of Cognac , if they have left me any . Happy is Stoobar that he was contented , without breaking his neck at the inspector 's step . "
153589	153596	153597	153597	Carne	356	" He has satisfied his conscience , "
153602	153649	153597	153597	Carne	356	" yet it can not be blameless , to make him run so fast . I am glad we have been saved from killing them . It would have been hard to know what to do next . But he will never trouble us here again . "
153656	153675	153677	153678	Admiral Darling	332	" Tell Miss Faith , when she comes in , that I shall be glad to see her , "
153814	153821	153822	153822	he	332	" I hope she will be sensible "
153843	153991	153822	153822	he	332	" I hope she will see the folly of it of living all her life as the bride of a ghost ; and herself such a beautiful , cheerful darling ! Loving , warm - hearted , sweet - tempered , adoring children , and adored by them ; obedient , gentle I ca n't think of anything good that she has n't got , except common - sense . And even for that , I like her all the more ; because it is so different from all the other girls . They have got too much one lover out of sight , even for a month or two , gone fighting for his Country , what do they do but take up with another , as I very greatly fear our Dolly would ? But Faith Why , my darling , how well you look ! "
153992	154008	154010	154013	the lovely young woman	4221	" How I wish that I could say the same of you , dear father ! "
154029	154100	154022	154022	her	4221	" you never used to have these little tucks and gathers here . I would rather almost that the French should come and devour us all , than see my father , whenever we do see him , once in a month , say , gauffred like this as their laundresses do it and getting reduced to the Classical shape , so that I can put one arm round him . "
154101	154105	154107	154108	the Admiral	747	" My darling , "
154122	154141	154107	154108	the Admiral	747	" you should not say such things to me , to remind me how very old I am ! "
154241	154250	154251	154251	she	315	" Tell me what harm I have done , "
154267	154347	154251	154251	she	315	" what have I done to vex you , father , that you say things fit to make me cry ? And yet I ought to laugh , because I know so well that you are only fishing for compliments . You are getting so active that I shall be frightened to go for a walk or a ride with you . Only I do love to see you look fat , and your darling forehead smooth and white . "
154348	154393	154866	154867	the Admiral	747	" My dear child , I must get up my substance . This very day I begin in earnest . Because I am to be a great man , Faith . How would you like to have to call me ' Sir Charles ' ? "
154394	154429	154251	154251	she	315	" Not at all , darling ; except when you deserve it , by being cross to me ; and that never , never happens . I wish there was more chance of it . "
154430	154526	154251	154251	she	315	" Well , dear , if you wo n't , the other people must ; for His Majesty has been graciously pleased to turn me into a Baronet . He says that I have earned it ; and perhaps I have ; at any rate , he put it so nicely that without being churlish I could not refuse . And it will be a good thing for Frank , I hope , by bringing him back from his democratic stuff . To myself it is useless ; but my children ought to like it . "
154527	154570	154866	154867	the Admiral	747	" And so they will , father , for your own dear sake . Let me be the first to salute you , father . Oh , Dolly will be in such a rage because you told me , without telling her ! "
154571	154578	154580	154581	the Admiral	747	" I never thought of that , "
154585	154745	154580	154581	the Admiral	747	" I am afraid that I shall get in for it . However , I have a right to please myself , and you need not tell her until I do . But that is not all my news , and not by any means the best of it . The King was reminded , the other day , of all that he and his family owe to the late Sir Edmond Scudamore , and better late than never , he has ordered your governess , as he called her , to be put on the list for a pension of 300 pounds a year . Nothing that once gets into his head can ever be got out of it , and he was shocked at seeing his old physician 's widow ' gone out as a governess gone out as a governess great disgrace to the royal family ! ' I am very glad that it happened so . "
154746	154785	154866	154867	the Admiral	747	" And so am I. She ought to have had it long and long ago , especially after the sad misfortune of her husband . You will let me tell her ? It will be such a pleasure . "
154786	154864	154866	154867	the Admiral	747	" Certainly , my dear ; you are the very one to do it . Tell her that her eldest pupil is come with a little piece of news for her ; it will make her smile she has a very pretty smile , which reminds me of the gallant Blyth . And now , my child , the third piece of news concerns yourself your good , and dutiful , and exceedingly sensible self . Ahem ! "
154885	154898	154875	154875	he	747	" I know what it is ; you need not tell me , "
154908	154931	154899	154899	Faith	315	" It is no use , father ; it is no good at all unless you intend to forget your own promise . "
154932	154939	154940	154940	he	747	" That I shall never do , "
154949	154988	154940	154940	he	747	" no , my dear child , I shall never attempt to drive instead of lead you . But you have not heard me out as yet . You do n't even know who it is I mean . "
154989	155033	154899	154899	Faith	315	" Oh yes , I do ; I know well enough , father . I am not like Dolly , universally admired . Because I do not want to be . You mean Lord Dashville can you tell me that you do n't ? "
155034	155039	154940	154940	he	747	" No , my dear "
155071	155113	155117	155117	he	747	" I can not deny that it is Lord Dashville , because that is the man , and no other . But how you could tell surpasses me , and it shows that he must be very often in your mind : "
155123	155185	155114	155115	the Admiral	747	" Now can you say anything against him ? Is he not honest , manly , single - minded , faithful as yourself , I do believe , good - looking , well - bred , a Tory , and a gentleman , certain to make any woman happy whom he loves ? Can you say a syllable against all that ? "
155186	155189	155191	155191	Faith	315	" No , "
155197	155200	155203	155203	she	315	" no , "
155214	155218	155219	155220	her father	754	" Very well , "
155227	155320	155219	155220	her father	754	" and can you deny that he is just the person you might have taken a great liking to fallen in love with , as they call it if only he had come before your mind was full of somebody else a very fine young fellow , no doubt ; but my darling , I wo n't say a word against him , only you know what I mean too well . And are you forever to be like a nun because it has pleased the Lord to take him from you ? "
155321	155339	155341	155341	Faith	315	" Lord Dashville has not advanced himself in my good opinion , if he cares for that , "
155357	155375	155341	155341	Faith	315	" by going to you , when I declined to have anything more to say to him . "
155376	155384	155386	155387	Sir Charles	332	" My dear , you are unjust , "
155389	155488	155386	155387	Sir Charles	332	" not purposely , I know , for you are the most upright darling that can be , in general . But you accuse young Dashville of what he never did . It was his good mother , the Countess of Blankton , a most kind - hearted and lady - like person , without any nonsense about her , who gave me the best cup of tea I ever tasted , and spoke with the very best feeling possible . She put it so sweetly that I only wish you could have been there to hear her . "
155489	155644	155219	155220	her father	754	" Father , what is the good of it all ? You hate turncoats even worse than traitors . Would you like your daughter to be one ? And when she would seem to have turned her coat for the ladies wear coats now , the horrid ugly things ! for the sake of position , and title , and all that . If Lord Dashville had been a poor man , with his own way to make in the world , a plain Mister , there might have been more to be said for it . But to think that I should throw over my poor darling because he will come home without a penny , and perhaps tattoed , but at any rate turned black , for the sake of a coronet , and a heap of gold oh , father , I shall break down , if you go on so ! "
155645	155702	155341	155341	Faith	315	" My dear girl , I will not say a word to vex you . But you are famous for common - sense , as well as every other good quality , and I would ask you to employ just a little of it . Can you bear me to speak of your trouble , darling ? "
155703	155744	155386	155387	Sir Charles	332	" Oh yes , I am so well accustomed to it now ; and I know that it is nothing compared to what thousands of people have to bear . Sometimes I am quite ashamed of giving way to it . "
155745	155828	155219	155220	her father	754	" You do not give way to it , Faith . No person can possibly say that of you . You are my brave , unselfish , cheerful , sweet - natured , upright , and loving child . Nobody knows , but you and I and perhaps I know it even more than you do the greatness of the self - command you use , to be pleasant and gay and agreeable , simply for the sake of those around you . "
155829	155834	155836	155836	Faith	315	" Then , father , "
155856	155875	155845	155846	the Admiral	747	" you think , after all , that I am that I am almost as good as Dolly ! "
155876	155987	155219	155220	her father	754	" You jealous little vixen , I shall recall every word I have said in your favour ! My child , and my pride , you are not only as good as Dolly , but my best hope is that when Dolly grows older she may be like you . Do n't cry , darling ; I ca n't stand crying , when it comes from eyes that so seldom do it . And now that you know what I think of you , allow me to think a little for you . I have some right to interfere in your life ; you will allow that wo n't you ? "
155988	156012	155219	155220	her father	754	" Father , you have all right , and a thousand times as much , because you are so gentle about using it . "
156013	156165	155845	155846	the Admiral	747	" I calls that bad English , as Zeb Tugwell says when he does n't want to understand a thing . But , my pretty dear , you must remember that you will not have a father always . Who will look after you , when I am gone , except the Almighty ? and He does not do it , except for the few who look after themselves . It is my duty to consider these points , and they override sentimentality . To me it is nothing that Dashville will be an Earl , and a man of great influence , if he keeps up his present high character ; but it is something to me that I find him modest , truthful , not led away by phantoms , a gentleman which is more than a nobleman and with his whole heart given to my dear child Faith . "
156192	156200	156201	156201	she	315	" I believe he is all that , "
156204	156215	156201	156201	she	315	" In that case , what more can you have ? "
156221	156239	155219	155220	her father	754	" It is one of the clearest things I ever knew , and one of the most consistent "
156248	156328	156329	156329	Faith	315	" as well as in every way desirable . Consider , not yourself which you never do but the state of the Country , and of Dolly . They have made me a baronet , for being away from home nearly every night of my life ; and if I had Dashville to see to things here , I might stay away long enough to be a lord myself , like my late middy the present Duke of Bronte . "
156333	156422	156329	156329	Faith	315	" You call me jealous ! My dear father , I know that you could have done a great deal more than Lord Nelson has , because he learned all that he knows from you . And now who is it that really defends the whole south coast of England against the French ? Is it Lord Nelson ? He has as much as he can do to look after their fleet in the Mediterranean . Admiral Cornwallis and Sir Charles Darling are the real defenders of England . "
156423	156600	156776	156776	he	747	" No , my dear , you must never say that , except of course in private . There may be some truth in it , but it would be laughed at in the present condition of the public mind . History may do me justice ; but after all it is immaterial . A man who does his duty should be indifferent to the opinion of the public , which begins more and more to be formed less by fact than by the newspapers of the day . But let us return to more important matters . You are now in a very sensible frame of mind . You see what my wishes are about you , and how reasonable they are . I should be so happy , my darling child , if you would consider them sensibly , and yield some little of your romantic views . I would not ask you unless I were sure that this man loves you as you deserve , and in his own character deserves your love . "
156601	156684	156329	156329	Faith	315	" Then , father , will this content you , dear ? Unless I hear something of Erle Twemlow , to show that he is living , and still holds to me , in the course of another twelvemonth , Lord Dashville , or anybody else , may try may try to take his place with me . Only I must not be worried I mean , I must not hear another word about it , until the time has quite expired . "
156685	156711	156329	156329	Faith	315	" It is a very poor concession , Faith . Surely you might say half a year . Consider , it is nearly three years now "
156712	156762	156776	156776	he	747	" No , papa , I should despise myself if I were so unjust to one so unlucky . And I only go so much from my own wishes because you are such a dear and good father . Not a bit of it for Lord Dashville 's sake . "
156763	156770	156771	156772	the Admiral	747	" Well , my poor darling , "
156796	156873	156790	156791	Lord Dashville	513	" half a loaf is better than no bread . If Dashville is worthy of your constant heart , he will stand this long trial of his constancy . This is the tenth day of August , 1804 . I hope that the Lord may be pleased to spare me till the 10th of August , 1805 . High time for them to come and lay the cloth . I am as hungry as a hunter . "
157125	157136	157138	157141	a great French historian	4255	" Such scenes as these tended much to agitate England , "
157143	157190	157138	157141	a great French historian	4255	" The British Press , arrogant and calumnious , as the Press always is in a free country , railed much at Napoleon and his preparations ; but railed as one who trembles at that which he would fain exhibit as the object of his laughter . "
159645	159654	159656	159656	Scudamore	429	" We must have her , my lads , "
159678	159692	159667	159667	he	429	" let us board her , and make off with all of them . "
159733	159740	159741	159741	they	4365	" Ay , ay , sir , "
159785	159795	159797	159799	the young commander	4369	" Easy all ! Throw a grapple on board , "
160095	160130	160086	160087	an officer	4393	" Monsieur is my prisoner . His men will be safe , and I can not permit him to risk his own life . Mon Dieu , it is my dear friend Captain Scudamore ! "
160131	160149	160086	160087	an officer	4393	" And you , my old friend , Captain Desportes ! I see it is hopeless to resist "
160161	160180	160086	160087	an officer	4393	" I can only congratulate myself that if I must fall , it is into such good hands . "
160181	160194	160196	160198	the French captain	8379	" My dear friend , how glad I am to see you ! "
160204	160280	160196	160198	the French captain	8379	" to you I owe more than to any man of your nation . I will not take your sword . No , no , my friend . You shall not be a prisoner , except in word . And how much you have advanced in the knowledge of our language , chiefly , I fear , at the expense of France . And now you will grow perfect , at the expense of England . "

162183	162188	162195	162199	the Prince of Wales himself	4485	" Jean de Brie , "
162446	162455	162457	162458	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" Take a month , if you like , "
162500	162518	162519	162519	he	580	" Come and dine with us on Saturday , and we will tell you all about it , "
162766	162778	162779	162780	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" What a corner of the world this is for gossip ! "
162810	162872	162792	162793	his cook	4422	" I am not such a fool as to care what they say . But I am greatly surprised at one thing . You know that I am a thorough Englishman ; may I tell you what I think , without offending you ? It is a delicate matter , because it concerns a relative of your own , my dear . "
162873	162906	162779	162780	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" I know what you mean . You will not offend me . Percival , I know how straightforward you are , and how keen of perception . I have expected this . "
162907	162986	162792	162793	his cook	4422	" And yet it seems presumptuous of me to say that you are all blind here , from the highest to the lowest . Except indeed yourself , as I now perceive . I will tell you my suspicions , or more than suspicions my firm belief about your cousin , Mr. Carne . I can trust you to keep this even from your father . Caryl Carne is a spy , in the pay of the French . "
162987	163002	162779	162780	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" I have long thought something , though not quite so bad as that , "
163009	163189	163003	163004	Miss Twemlow	380	" because he has behaved to us so very strangely . My mother is his own father 's sister , as you know , and yet he has never dined with us more than once , and then he scarcely said a word to any one . And he never yet has asked us to visit him at the castle ; though for that we can make all allowance , of course , because of its sad condition . Then everybody thought he had taken to smuggling , and after all his losses , no one blamed him , especially as all the Carnes had done it , even when they were the owners of the land . But ever since poor Mr. Cheeseman , our church - warden , tried to destroy himself with his own rope , all the parish began to doubt about the smuggling , because it pays so well and makes the people very cheerful . But from something he had seen , my father felt quite certain that the true explanation was smuggling . "
163190	163212	162792	162793	his cook	4422	" Indeed ! Do you know at all what it was he saw , and when , and under what circumstances ? "
163226	163283	163213	163214	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" Really I can not tell you all those things ; they are scarcely of general interest . My dear father said little about it : all knowledge is denied in this good world to women . But no doubt he would tell you , if you asked him , when there were no ladies present . "
163284	163288	163290	163291	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" I will , "
163293	163333	163290	163291	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" He is most judicious ; he knows when to speak , and when to hold his tongue . And I think that you combine with beauty one of those two gifts which is the utmost to be expected . "
163334	163370	163371	163372	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" Percival , you put things very nicely , which is all that could be expected of a man . But do take my advice in this matter , and say no more about it . "
163458	163465	163452	163453	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" It must be seen to . "
163466	163472	163474	163475	Mr. Twemlow	299	" Stubbard has been there , "
163483	163500	163474	163475	Mr. Twemlow	299	" Stubbard has made an official inspection , which relieves us of all concern with it . "
163501	163546	163452	163453	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" Captain Stubbard is an ass . It is a burning shame that important affairs should be entrusted to such fellows . The country is in peril , deadly peril ; and every Englishman is bound to act as if he were an officer . "
163645	163651	163652	163652	he	271	" Bring me a lantern , "
163672	163698	163652	163652	he	271	" and the little flask of oil with the feather in it . It is high time to put the Inspector 's step in order . "
163791	163907	163776	163776	Napoleon	385	" How does it work ? Quite stiff with rust . I thought so . Nothing is ever in order , unless I see to it myself . Give me the lantern . Now oil the bearings thoroughly . Put the feather into the socket , and work the pin in and out , that the oil may go all round . Now pour in some oil from the lip of the flask ; but not upon the treadle , you old blockhead . Now do the other end the same . Ah , now it would go with the weight of a mouse ! I have a great mind to make you try it . "
163908	163932	163933	163933	They	4511	" What would you do , sir , if my neck was broken ? Who would do your work , as I do ? "
164073	164081	164083	164084	old Jerry	366	" Goes like spittle now , sir , "
164086	164142	164083	164084	old Jerry	366	" but I do n't want no more harm in this crick of life . The Lord be pleased to keep all them Examiners at home . Might have none to find their corpusses until next leap - year . I hope with all my heart they wo n't come poking their long noses here . "
164143	164160	164162	164162	Carne	271	" Well , I rather hope they will . They want a lesson in this neighbourhood , "
164399	164409	164410	164410	she	1524	" In some ways it is a sad thing , "
164413	164455	164410	164410	she	1524	" and will be a terrible blow to him , just when he was rising so fast in the service . But we must not rebel more than we can help , against the will of the Lord , Sir Charles . "
164456	164464	164466	164467	the Admiral	747	" How philosophical , and how commonplace ! "
164485	164502	164470	164470	he	332	" Perhaps you scarcely understand my views , and perhaps I am wrong in having them , "
164509	164558	164503	164504	Lady Scudamore	547	" My son 's advancement is very dear to me , and this will of course retard it . But I care most of all for his life , and now that will be safe for a long while . They never kill their prisoners , do they ? "
164559	164610	164470	164470	he	332	" No , ma'am , no . They behave very well to them ; better , I 'm afraid , than we do to ours . They treat them quite as guests , when they fall into good hands . Though Napoleon himself is not too mild in that way . "
164611	164718	164719	164727	The Admiral , who had never received a scratch	4527	" My son has fallen into very good hands , as you yourself assure me that Captain Desportes , a gallant officer and kind gentleman , as I know from your daughter 's description . Blyth is quite equal to Lord Nelson in personal daring , and possibly not behind him in abilities . Consider how shockingly poor Nelson has been injured , and he feels convinced himself that they will have his life at last . No officer can be a hero without getting very sad wounds , and perhaps losing his life . Every one who does his duty must at least be wounded . "
164761	164782	164783	164784	the lady	1524	" I am sure every time I have heard a gun coming from the sea , and especially after dark , "
164792	164900	164783	164784	the lady	1524	" it has made me miserable to know that probably Blyth was rushing into some deadly conflict . But now I shall feel that he can not do that ; and I hope they will keep him until the fighting grows milder . He used to send me all his money , poor dear boy ! And now I shall try to send him some of mine , if it can be arranged about bank - notes . And now I can do it very easily , thanks to your kindness , Sir Charles , his father 's best friend , and his own , and mine . "
164935	164944	164946	164947	the Admiral	747	" You owe me no thanks , ma'am , "
164951	164976	164946	164947	the Admiral	747	" if any thanks are due , they are due to the King , for remembering at last what he should have done before . "
164977	165027	164783	164784	the lady	1524	" Would he ever have thought of me , but for you ? It is useless to talk in that way , Sir Charles ; it only increases the obligation , which I must entreat you not to do . How I wish I could help you in anything ! "
165028	165036	165037	165037	he	747	" Every day you are helping me , "
165043	165082	165037	165037	he	747	" although I am away too often to know all about it , or even to thank you . I hope my dear Faith has persuaded you not to leave us for the winter , as you threatened . "
165083	165101	165103	165104	the lady	1524	" Faith can persuade me to anything she pleases . She possesses the power of her name , "
165106	165203	165103	165104	the lady	1524	" but the power is not called for , when the persuasion is so pleasant . For a month , I must be away to visit my dear mother , as I always have done at this time of year ; and then , but for one thing , I would return most gladly . For I am very selfish , you must know , Sir Charles I have a better chance of hearing of my dear son at these head - quarters of the defence of England , than I should have even in London . "
165204	165207	165209	165210	the Admiral	747	" Certainly , "
165303	165329	165290	165290	she	277	" Sir Charles , for the moment , forgot his best manners , and spread his coat so that one might see between his legs . "
165335	165339	165341	165341	she	277	" he said , "
165557	165558	165559	165559	She	277	" "
165567	165583	165559	165559	She	277	" Blyth 's mother smiled demurely , as if she were sorry to confess it ; "
165602	165603	165590	165591	Sir Charles	332	" "
165644	165645	165646	165646	I	0	" "
165759	165760	165761	165761	Dolly	277	" "
165781	165794	165795	165795	Nelson	276	" said the Admiral , as if he were half doubtful still ; "
165931	166190	166205	166205	she	4564	" Lady Scudamore could not help laughing a little , and she hoped for her son 's sake that this account was true . Her gratitude and good - will to the Admiral , as well as her duty to her son , made her give the promise sought for ; and she began to prepare for her journey at once , that she might be back in good time for the winter . But she felt very doubtful , at leaving the Hall , whether she had done quite right in keeping her suspicions of Dolly from Dolly 's father . For with eyes which were sharpened by jealousy for the interests , or at least the affections , of her son , she had long perceived that his lady - love was playing a dangerous game with Caryl Carne . Sometimes she believed that she ought to speak of this , for the good of the family ; because she felt the deepest mistrust and dislike of Carne , who strictly avoided her whenever he could ; but on the other hand she found the subject most delicate and difficult to handle . For she had taken good care at the outset not to be here upon any false pretences . At the very first interview with her host she had spoken of Blyth 's attachment to his younger daughter , of which the Admiral had heard already from that youthful sailor . And the Admiral had simply said , as in Captain Twemlow 's case : "
166226	166338	166205	166205	she	4564	" And now if she told him of the other love - affair , it would look like jealousy of a rival . Perhaps a hundred times a day , as her love for gentle Faith grew faster than her liking for the sprightly Dolly , she would sigh that her son did not see things like herself ; but bitter affliction had taught her that the course of this life follows our own wishes about as much as another man 's dog heeds our whistle . But , for all that , this good lady hoped some day to see things come round as she would like to bring them . "
166349	166386	166342	166342	we	4565	" said Faith when they had done waving handkerchiefs at the great yellow coach going slowly up the hill , with its vast wicker basket behind , and the guard perched over it with his blunderbus ; "
166414	166415	166417	166417	themselves	4569	" "
166422	166426	166417	166417	themselves	4569	" answered Dolly . "
166454	166455	166445	166445	They	4570	" "
166491	166492	166479	166479	you	0	" "
166543	166544	166535	166535	I	0	" "
166596	166597	166598	166598	I	0	" "
166605	166621	166598	166598	I	0	" cried Dolly , with her bright colour deepened , and her grey eyes flashing , "
166657	166658	166646	166646	she	6834	" "
166671	166694	166669	166669	Dolly	277	" Faith answered , with some sternness , and a keen look at her sister , whose eyes fell beneath her gaze . "
166777	166828	166755	166755	he	345	" They had sent the carriage home that they might walk across the fields , and this little scene between the sisters took place upon a foot - path which led back to their grounds . Dolly knew that she was in the wrong , and that increased her anger . "
166866	166867	166858	166858	you	0	" "
166875	166890	166858	166858	you	0	" Faith spoke with a smile of superior calmness , as Dolly tossed her head "
166966	166967	166968	166968	My	0	" "
167004	167005	167006	167006	I	0	" "
167191	167192	167189	167189	Dolly	277	" "
167208	167229	167199	167199	I	0	" Dolly sighed deeply , but a wicked smile lay ambushed in her bright eyes and upon her rosy lips . "
167287	167288	167253	167253	He	593	" "
167301	167317	167318	167318	he	593	" cried Faith , who had prepared her heart and eyes for tears of sympathy ; "
167391	167392	167384	167384	I	0	" "
167431	167432	167428	167428	my	0	" "
167441	167455	167435	167435	you	0	" cried Faith across the corner of the meadow where the paths diverged ; "
167476	167527	167471	167471	your	0	" Dolly sent a merry laugh across the widening interval ; and Faith , who was just beginning to fear that she had been in a passion , was convinced by that laugh that she had not . But the weight lifted from her conscience fell more heavily upon her heart .
168196	168205	168206	168206	he	356	" You should have been born in France , "
168248	168284	168206	168206	he	356	" that is the land you belong to , darling , by beauty and manners and mind and taste , and most of all by your freedom from prejudice , and great liberality of sentiment . "
168285	168299	168300	168300	Dolly	335	" But I thought we were quite as good - looking in England ; "
168320	168335	168302	168302	her	335	" but of course you know best . I know nothing of French ladies . "
168336	168345	168346	168346	Carne	356	" Do n't be a fool , Dolly ; "
168359	168440	168346	168346	Carne	356	" There never was a French girl to equal you in loveliness ; but you must not suppose that you beat them all round . One point particularly you are far behind in . A French woman leaves all political questions , and national matters , and public affairs , entirely to her husband , or her lover , as the case may be . Whatever he wishes is the law for her . Thy gods shall be my gods . "
168441	168472	168302	168302	her	335	" But you said they had great liberality of sentiment , and now you say they have no opinions of their own ! How can the two things go together ? "
168473	168477	168479	168479	Carne	356	" Very easily , "
168492	168626	168479	168479	Carne	356	" they take their opinions from their husbands , who are always liberal . This produces happiness on both sides a state of things unknown in England . Let me tell you of something important , mainly as it concerns yourself , sweet Dolly . The French are certain to unite with England , and then we shall be the grandest nation in the world . No power in Europe can stand before us . All will be freedom , and civilization , and great ideas , and fine taste in dress . I shall recover the large estates , that would now be mine , but for usury and fraud . And you will be one of the first ladies in the world , as nature has always intended you to be . "
168627	168675	168302	168302	her	335	" That sounds very well ; but how is it to be done ? How can France unite with England , when they are bitter enemies ? Is France to conquer England first ? Or are we to conquer France , as we always used to do ? "
168676	168836	168302	168302	her	335	" That would be a hard job now , when France is the mistress of the Continent . No , there need be no conquering , sweet Dolly , but only a little removal . The true interest of this country is as that mighty party , the Whigs , perceive to get rid of all the paltry forms and dry bones of a dynasty which is no more English than Napoleon is , and to join that great man in his warfare against all oppression . Your brother Frank is a leading spirit ; he has long cast off that wretched insular prejudice which defeats all good . In the grand new scheme of universal right , which must prevail very shortly , Frank Darling will obtain that foremost place to which his noble views entitle him . You , as his sister , and my wife , will be adored almost as much as you could wish . "
168837	168843	168845	168845	Dolly	595	" It sounds very grand , "
168861	168900	168845	168845	Dolly	595	" but what is to become of the King , and Queen , and all the royal family ? And what is my father to do , and Faith ? Although she has not behaved well to me . "
168901	168938	168302	168302	her	335	" Those details will be arranged to everybody 's satisfaction . Little prejudices will subside , when it is seen that they are useless . Every possible care will be taken not to injure any one . "
168939	168949	168951	168951	Dolly	595	" But how is it all to be done ? "
168961	168993	168951	168951	Dolly	595	" Are the French to land , and overrun the country ? I am sure I never should agree to that . Are all our defenders to be thrown into prison ? "
168994	169098	168302	168302	her	335	" Certainly not . There will be no prisons . The French might have to land , as a matter of form ; but not to overrun the country , only to secure British liberties and justice . All sensible people would hasten to join them , and any opposition would be quenched at once . Then such a glorious condition of mankind would ensue as has never been known in this world peace , wealth , universal happiness , gaiety , dancing everywhere , no more shabby clothes , no more dreary Sundays . How do you like the thought of it ? "
169099	169378	168302	168302	her	335	" Well , some of it sounds very nice ; but I do n't see the use of universal justice . Justice means having one 's own rights ; and it is impossible for everybody to do that , because of other people . And as for the French coming to put things right , they had better attend to their own affairs first . And as if any Englishman would permit it ! Why , even Frank would mount his wig and gown for he is a full - fledged barrister now , you know , and come and help to push them back into the sea . And I hope that you would do so too . I am not going to marry a Frenchman . You belong to an old English family , and you were born in England , and your name is English , and the property that ought to belong to you . I hope you do n't consider yourself a Frenchman because your mother is a great French lady , after so many generations of Carnes , all English , every bit of them . I am an English girl , and I care very little for things that I do n't see such as justice , liberty , rights of people , and all that . But I do care about my relations , and our friends , and the people that live here , and the boats , and all the trees , and the land that belongs to my father . Very likely you would want to take that away , and give it to some miserable Frenchman . "
169379	169391	169392	169392	Carne	271	" Dolly , my dear , you must not be excited , "
169402	169515	169399	169400	a father	10196	" powerful as your comprehension is , for the moment these things are beyond it . Your meaning is excellent , very good , very great ; but to bring it to bear requires further information . We will sit by the side of the sea to - morrow , darling , if you grant me a view of your loveliness again ; and there you will see things in a larger light than upon this narrow bench , with your father 's trees around us , and your father 's cows enquiring whether I am good to eat . Get away , cow ! Do you take me for a calf ? "
169711	169723	169725	169725	Dolly	595	" Is that universal peace , and gentleness , and justice ? "
169736	169871	169725	169725	Dolly	595	" Is this the way the lofty French redress the wrongs of England ? What had poor Dewlips done , I should like to know ? Kiss me , my pretty , and tell me how you would like the French army to land , as a matter of form ? The form you would take would be beef , I 'm afraid ; not even good roast beef , but bouillon , potage , fricandeau , friture anything one can not taste any meat in ; and that is how your wrongs would be redressed , after having had both your horns knocked off . And about the same fate for John Bull , your master , unless he keeps his horns well sharpened . Do I not speak the truth , monsieur ? "
169920	169926	169927	169927	he	271	" Never mind matters political , "
169945	169962	169927	169927	he	271	" what are all the politics in the world compared with your good opinion , Beauty ? "
169968	169971	169963	169963	Dolly	277	" Beauty , "
169986	170056	170073	170073	Dolly	277	" You must be quite certain that I would do nothing to injure a country which contains my Dolly . And as for Madam Cow , I will beg her pardon , though my cane is hurt a great deal more than her precious horns are . Behold me snap it in twain , although it is the only handsome one I possess , because it has offended you ! "
170057	170071	170073	170073	Dolly	277	" Oh , what a pity ! What a lovely piece of wood ! "
170297	170306	170308	170308	Carne	271	" A pest upon those watch - dogs ! "
170310	170612	170308	170308	Carne	271	" They are always wide - awake , and forever at their stations . Instead of growing tired , they get sharper every day . Even Charron can scarcely run through them now . But I know who could do it , if he could only be trusted . With a pilot - boat it is a fine idea a pilot - boat entered as of Pebbleridge . The Pebbleridge people hate Springhaven , through a feud of centuries , and Springhaven despises Pebbleridge . It would answer well , although the landing is so bad , and no anchorage possible in rough weather . I must try if Dan Tugwell will undertake it . None of the rest know the coast as he does , and few of them have the bravery . But Dan is a very sulky fellow , very difficult to manage . He will never betray us ; he is wonderfully grateful ; and after that battle with the press - gang , when he knocked down the officer and broke his arm , he will keep pretty clear of the Union - jack . But he goes about moping , and wondering , and mooning , as if he were wretched about what he has to do . Bless my soul , where is my invention ? I see the way to have him under my thumb . Reason is an old coat hanging on a peg ; passion is the fool who puts it on and runs away with it . Halloa ! Who are you ? And what do you want at such a time as this ? Surely you can see that I am not at leisure now . Why , Tugwell , I thought that you were far away at sea ! "
170613	170720	171805	171805	Carne	357	" So I was , sir ; but she travels fast . I never would believe the old London Trader could be driven through the water so . Sam Polwhele knows how to pile it on a craft , as well as he do upon a man , sir . I wo n't serve under him no more , nor Captain Charcoal either . I have done my duty by you . Squire Carne , the same as you did by me , sir ; and thanking you for finding me work so long , my meaning is to go upon the search to - morrow . "
170721	170735	170737	170737	Carne	357	" What fools they must have been to let this fellow come ashore ! "
170751	170862	170740	170740	he	357	" Tugwell , you can not do this with any honour , after we have shown you all the secrets of our enterprise . You know that what we do is of the very highest honour , kind and humane and charitable , though strictly forbidden by a most inhuman government . How would you like , if you were a prisoner in France , to be debarred from all chance of getting any message from your family , your wife , your sweetheart , or your children , from year 's end to year 's end , and perhaps be dead for months without their knowing anything about it ? "
170863	171028	171805	171805	Carne	357	" Well , sir , I should think it very hard indeed ; though , if I was dead , I should n't know much more about it . But , without reproach to you , I can not make out altogether that our only business is to carry letters for the prisoners , as now may be in England , from their loving friends to command in their native country . I wo n't say against you , sir , if you say it is that is , to the outside of all your knowledge . And twenty thousand of them may need letters by the sack . But what use they could make , sir , of cannon as big as I be , and muskets that would kill a man a hundred yards of distance , and bayonets more larger and more sharper than ever I see before , even with the Royal Volunteers this goes out of all my calculation . "
171029	171071	171805	171805	Carne	357	" Daniel , you have expressed your views , which are remarkable as indeed they always are with your usual precision . But you have not observed things with equal accuracy . Do you know when a gun is past service ? "
171072	171123	170740	170740	he	357	" No , sir ; I never was a poacher , no - how . Squire Darling , that is to say , Sir Charles Darling now , according to a chap on board , he was always so good upon his land that nobody durst go a - poaching . "
171124	171386	170740	170740	he	357	" I mean a cannon , Dan . They do n't poach with cannon yet , though they may come to do it , as the game - laws increase . Do you know when a cannon is unsafe to fire , though it may look as bright as ever , like a worn - out poker ? All those things that have frightened you are only meant for ornament . You know that every ancient building ought to have its armoury , as this castle always had , until they were taken away and sold . My intention is to restore it , when I can afford to do so . And having a lot of worn - out weapons offered me for next to nothing , I seized the chance of bringing them . When times are better , and the war is over , I may find time to arrange them . But that is not of much importance . The great point is to secure the delivery of letters from their native land to the brave men here as prisoners . I can not afford to do that for nothing , though I make no profit out of it . I have so many things to think about that I scarcely know which to consider first . And after all , what matters to us whether those poor men are allowed to die , and be buried like dogs , without knowledge of their friends ? Why should we run the risk of being punished for them ? "
171387	171426	171805	171805	Carne	357	" Well , sir , that seems hard doctrine , if I may be allowed to say so , and not like your kind - heartedness . Our Government have no right to stop them of their letters . "
171427	171576	170740	170740	he	357	" It is a cruel thing . But how are we to help it ? The London Trader is too large for the purpose , and she is under suspicion now . I tell you everything , Daniel , because I know that you are a true - hearted fellow , and far above all blabbing . I have thought once or twice of obtaining leave to purchase a stout and handy pilot - boat , with her licence and all that transferred to us , and so running to and fro when needful . The only risk then would be from perils of the sea ; and even the pressmen dare not meddle with a pilot - boat . By - the - by , I have heard that you knocked some of them about . Tugwell , you might have got us all into sad trouble . "
171577	171654	170740	170740	he	357	" Was I to think of what I was doing , Squire Carne , when they wanted to make a slave of me ? I would serve King George with a good heart , in spite of all that father has said against it . But it must be with a free will , Squire Carne , and not to be tied hand and foot to it . How would you like that yourself , sir ? "
171655	171755	171805	171805	Carne	357	" Well , I think I should have done as you did , Dan , if I had been a British sailor . But as to this pilot - boat , I must have a bold and good seaman to command it . A man who knows the coast , and is not afraid of weather . Of course we should expect to pay good wages ; 3 pounds a week , perhaps , and a guinea for every bag of letters landed safe . There are plenty of men who would jump at such a chance , Dan . "
171756	171800	170740	170740	he	357	" I 'll be bound there are , sir . And it is more than I am worth , if you mean offering the place to me . It would suit me wonderful , if I was certain that the job was honest . "
171801	171804	171805	171805	Carne	357	" Daniel Tugwell "
171810	171869	171805	171805	Carne	357	" I will not lose my temper , for I am sure you mean no insult . But you must be of a very low , suspicious nature , and quite unfit for any work of a lofty and unselfish order , if you can imagine that a man in my position , a man of my large sentiments "
171870	171885	171886	171886	Dan	282	" Oh , no , sir , no ; it was not at all that "
171895	171924	170740	170740	he	357	" it was nothing at all of that manner of thinking . I heartily ask your pardon , sir , if it seemed to go in that way . "
171925	171931	171933	171933	Carne	357	" Do n't do that , "
171935	172116	171933	171933	Carne	357	" because I can make allowances . I know what a fine nature is , and how it takes alarm at shadows . I am always tender with honest scruples , because I find so many of them in myself . I should not have been pleased with you , if you had accepted my offer although so advantageous , and full of romantic interest until you were convinced of its honourable nature . I have no time for argument , and I am sorry that you must not come up to the castle for supper , because we have an old Springhaven man there , who would tell your father all about you , which you especially wish to avoid . But if you feel inclined for this berth as you sailors seem to call it and hesitate through some patriotic doubts , though I can not understand what they are , I will bring you a document if you meet me here to - morrow night from Admiral Sir Charles Darling , which I think will satisfy you . "
172117	172137	172228	172228	HIS	4657	" And shall I be allowed to keep it , sir , to show , in case of trouble ? "
172138	172182	171933	171933	Carne	357	" Very likely . But I can not say for certain . Some of those official forms must be returned , others not ; all depends upon their rules . Now go and make yourself comfortable . How are you off for money ? "
172183	172225	172228	172228	HIS	4657	" Plenty , sir , plenty . I must not go where anybody knows me , or to - morrow half the talk at old Springhaven would be about me . Good - night , sir , and God bless you . "
172318	172326	172328	172329	Sir Charles	332	" Here at last we have him ! "
172336	172413	172328	172329	Sir Charles	332	" and not more than five weeks old , I declare ! Dolly , be ready , and call Faith down . Now read it , my dear , for our benefit . Your godfather writes a most excellent hand , considering that it is his left hand ; but my eyes are sore from so much night - work . Put on my specs , Dolly ; I should like to see you in them . "
172414	172444	172328	172329	Sir Charles	332	" Am I to read every word , papa , just as it comes ? You know that he generally puts in words that are rather strong for me . "
172445	172482	172328	172329	Sir Charles	332	" Nelson never thought or wrote a single word unfit for the nicest young lady . But you may hold up your hand if you come to any strong expressions , and we shall understand them . "
172483	172510	172328	172329	Sir Charles	332	" Then I shall want both hands as soon as ever we come to the very first Frenchman . But this is what my godfather says : "
172522	172782	172784	172784	You	4662	" ' MY DEAR LINGO , It was only yesterday that I received your letter of July 21st ; it went in a Spanish smuggling boat to the coast of Italy and returned again to Spain , not having met any of our ships . And now I hope that you will see me before you see this letter . We are certain to be at war with Spain before another month is out , and I am heartily sorry for it , for I like those fellows better than the French , because they are not such liars . My successor has been appointed , I have reason to hope , and must be far on his way by this time ; probably Keith , but I can not say . Ministers can not suppose that I want to fly the service ; my whole life has proved the contrary ; if they refuse , I shall most certainly leave in March or April , for a few months ' rest I must have , or else die . My cough is very bad , and my side where I was struck off Cape St. Vincent is very much swelled , at times a lump as large as my fist is brought on by violent coughing , but I hope and believe my lungs are sound . I hope to do good service yet , or else I should not care so much . But if I am in my grave , how can I serve the Country ? "

172943	173195	172933	172933	I	0	" ' I have been most unlucky for some time now , and to tell the truth I may say always . But I am the last man in the world to grumble as you , my dear Lingo , can testify . I always do the utmost , with a single mind , and leave the thought of miserable pelf to others , men perhaps who never saw a shotted cannon fired . You know who made eighty thousand pounds , without having to wipe his pigtail dirty things , I am glad they are gone out but my business is to pay other people 's debts , and receive all my credits in the shape of cannon - balls . This is always so , and I should let it pass as usual , except for a blacker trick than I have ever known before . For fear of giving me a single chance of earning twopence , they knew that there was a million and a half of money coming into Cadiz from South America in four Spanish frigates , and instead of leaving me to catch them , they sent out Graham Moore you know him very well with orders to pocket everything . This will create a war with Spain , a war begun with robbery on our part , though it must have come soon in any case . For everywhere now , except where I am , that fiend of a Corsican is supreme . "
173375	173458	173461	173461	Dolly	277	" ' And now , my dear Lingo , allow me to enquire how you are getting on with your Coast - defence . I never did attach much importance to their senseless invasion scheme . The only thing to make it formidable would be some infernal traitor on the coast , some devilish spy who would keep them well informed , and enable them to land where least expected . If there is such a scoundrel , may the Lord Almighty ' "
173483	173595	173474	173474	her	277	" ' I have often told you , as you may remember , that Springhaven is the very place I should choose , if I were commander of the French flotilla . It would turn the flank of all the inland defences , and no British ship could attack their intrenchments , if once they were snug below the windows of the Hall . But they are not likely to know this , thank God ; and if they did , they would have a job to get there . However , it is wise to keep a sharp lookout , for they know very well that I am far away . "
173808	173813	173815	173815	NELSON	276	" ' Yours affectionately , "

173835	173848	173833	173833	I	0	" said the Admiral , laughing at the face his daughter made ; "
173936	174027	173931	173931	she	277	" To the coaxing voice of her father , and the playful glance that she used to play with , Dolly had not rushed up at all , either with mind , or , if that failed , with body , as she always used to do . She hurried towards the door , as if she longed to be away from them ; and then , as if she would rather not make any stir about it , sat down and pretended to have caught her dress in something . "
174041	174055	174038	174038	she	277	" Faith said aloud , so that Dolly might hear all of it ; "
174121	174122	174125	174125	my	0	" "
174129	174154	174125	174125	my	0	" said the Admiral , much alarmed at the prospect of a broil between them , such as he remembered about three years back , "
174381	174732	174372	174372	she	547	" The girls laughed at this , as they were meant to do . And they hurried off together , to compare opinions . After all these years of independence , no one should be set up over them . Upon that point Faith was quite as resolute as Dolly ; and her ladyship would have refused to come back , if she had overheard their council . For even in the loftiest feminine nature lurks a small tincture of jealousy . But Dolly was now in an evil frame of mind about many things which she could not explain even to herself , with any satisfaction . Even that harmless and pleasant letter from her great godfather went amiss with her ; and instead of laughing at the words about herself , as with a sound conscience she must have done , she brooded over them , and turned them bitter . No man could have mixed up things as she did , but her mind was nimble . For the moment , she hated patriotism , because Nelson represented it ; and feeling how wrong he had been about herself , she felt that he was wrong in everything . The French were fine fellows , and had quite as much right to come here as we had to go and harass them , and a little abatement of English conceit might be a good thing in the long - run . Not that she would let them stay here long ; that was not to be thought of , and they would not wish it . But a little excitement would be delightful , and a great many things might be changed for the better , such as the treatment of women in this country , which was barbarous , compared to what it was in France . Caryl had told her a great deal about that ; and the longer she knew him the more she was convinced of his wisdom and the largeness of his views , so different from the savage spirit of Lord Nelson .

175007	175017	175004	175004	his	385	" you have turned the tables upon him well . "
175227	175232	175234	175235	the Emperor	9832	" Ha ! ha ! "
175244	175369	175234	175235	the Emperor	9832	" you expected to find me a monster , as I am portrayed by your caricaturists . Your countrymen are not kind to me , except the foremost of them the great poets . But they will understand me better by - and - by , when justice prevails , and the blessings of peace , for which I am striving perpetually . But the English nation , if it were allowed a voice , would proclaim me its only true friend and ally . You know that , if you are one of the people , and not of the hateful House of Lords , which engrosses all the army and the navy . Are you in connection with the House of Lords ? "
175418	175530	175400	175400	Napoleon	385	" Very well . Then you can speak the truth . What do they think of all this grand army ? Are they aware that , for their own good , it will very soon occupy London ? Are they forming themselves to act as my allies , when I have reduced them to reason ? Is it now made entirely familiar to their minds that resistance to me is as hopeless as it has been from the first unwise ? If they would submit , without my crossing , it would save them some disturbance , and me a great expense . I have often hoped to hear of it . "
175531	175540	175541	175541	Scudamore	429	" You will never do that , sire , "
175568	175580	175541	175541	Scudamore	429	" England will not submit , even if you conquer her . "
175581	175593	175594	175594	Napoleon	385	" It is well said , and doubtless you believe it , "
175614	175718	175594	175594	Napoleon	385	" but England is the same as other nations , although the most obstinate among them . When her capital is occupied , her credit ruined , her great lords unable to obtain a dinner , the government which is not the country will yield , and the country must follow it . I have heard that the King , and the Court , and the Parliament , talk of flying to the north , and there remaining , while the navy cuts off our communications , and the inferior classes starve us . Have you heard of any such romance as that ? "
175719	175724	175731	175731	him	429	" No , sire : "
175743	175769	175594	175594	Napoleon	385	" I have never heard of any such plan , and no one would think of packing up , until our fleet has been demolished . "
175770	175795	175594	175594	Napoleon	385	" Your fleet ? Yes , yes . How many ships are now parading to and fro , and getting very tired of it ? "
175796	175805	175810	175810	his	429	" Your Majesty 's officers know that best , "
175815	175840	175810	175810	his	429	" I have been a prisoner for a month and more , and kept ten miles inland , out of sight of the sea . "
175841	175886	175594	175594	Napoleon	385	" But you have been well treated , I hope . You have no complaint to make , Monsieur Scutamour ? Your name is French , and you speak the language well . We set the fair example in the treatment of brave men . "
175887	175895	175896	175898	the young officer	3898	" Sire , I have been treated , "
175912	175929	175896	175898	the young officer	3898	" as a gentleman amongst gentlemen . I might say as a friend among kind friends . "
175930	176012	175594	175594	Napoleon	385	" That is as it should be . It is my wish always . Few of your English fabrications annoy me more than the falsehoods about that . It is most ungenerous , when I do my best , to charge me with strangling brave English captains . But Desportes fought well , before you took his vessel . Is it not so ? Speak exactly as you think . I like to hear the enemy 's account of every action . "
176013	176051	175594	175594	Napoleon	385	" Captain Desportes , sire , fought like a hero , and so did all his crew . It was only his mishap in sticking fast upon a sand - bank that enabled us to overpower him . "
176052	176118	175896	175898	the young officer	3898	" And now he has done the like to you . You speak with a brave man 's candour . You shall be at liberty to see the sea , monsieur ; for a sailor always pines for that . I will give full instructions to your friend Desportes about you . But one more question before you go is there much anxiety in England ? "
176119	176144	175594	175594	Napoleon	385	" Yes , sire , a great deal . But we hope not to allow your Majesty 's armament to enter and increase it . "
176145	176172	175594	175594	Napoleon	385	" Ah , we shall see , we shall see how that will be . Now farewell , Captain . Tell Desportes to come to me . "
176173	176187	176194	176194	he	4740	" Well , my dear friend , you have made a good impression , "
176209	176365	176189	176191	the French sailor	4740	" all you have to do is to give your word of honour to avoid our lines , and keep away from the beach , and of course to have no communication with your friends upon military subjects . I am allowed to place you for the present at Beutin , a pleasant little hamlet on the Canche , where lives an old relative of mine , a Monsieur Jalais , an ancient widower , with a large house and one servant . I shall be afloat , and shall see but little of you , which is the only sad part of the business . You will have to report yourself to your landlord at eight every morning and at eight o'clock at night , and only to leave the house between those hours , and not to wander more than six miles from home . How do these conditions approve themselves to you ? "
176366	176377	176378	176378	Scudamore	429	" I call them very liberal , and very handsome , "
176387	176415	176382	176382	he	429	" Two miles ' range is all that we allow in England to French officers upon parole . These generous terms are due to your kind friendship . "
178202	178204	178513	178513	he	4864	" pill "
178238	178244	178245	178245	he	429	" I am justly forbidden , "
178253	178505	178245	178245	he	429	" to visit the camp , or endeavour to learn anything done by the army of invasion . And I have pledged myself to that effect . But this is a different case altogether . When Englishmen come here as traitors to their country , and in a place well within my range , my duty is to learn the meaning of it ; and if I find treachery of importance working , then I must consider about my parole , and probably withdraw it . That would be a terrible blow to me , because I should certainly be sent far inland , and kept in a French prison perhaps for years , with little chance of hearing from my friends again . And then she would give me up as lost , that faithful darling , who has put aside all her bright prospects for my sake . How I wish I had never seen that boat ! and I thought it was coming to bring me such good news ! I am bound to give them one day 's grace , for they might not know where to find me at once , and to - night I could not get near them , without overstaying my time to be in - doors . But if I hear nothing to - morrow , and see nothing , I must go round , so as not to be seen , and learn something about her the very next morning . "
179504	179508	179489	179489	we	4902	" Look out ! "
180056	180063	180064	180066	this good lady	10334	" Prosecute him , prosecute him , "
180070	180375	180064	180066	this good lady	10334	" You ought to have been a magistrate , Joshua the first magistrate in the Bible was that and then you would have known how to do things . But because you would have to go to Sir Charles Darling whose Sir can never put him on the level of the Carnes you have some right feeling against taking out a summons . In that I agree with you ; it would be very dreadful here . But in London he might be punished , I am sure ; and I know a great deal about the law , for I never had any one connected with me who was not a magistrate ; the Lord Mayor has a Court of his own for trying the corporation under the chair ; and if this was put properly before him by a man like Mr. Furkettle , upon the understanding that he should not be paid unless he won his case , I am sure the result would be three years ' imprisonment . By that time he would have worn out his coat with jailer 's keys upon it , which first attracted our poor Eliza ; or if he was not allowed to wear it , it would go out of fashion , and be harmless . No one need know a word about it here , for Captain Stubbard would oblige us gladly by cutting it out of the London papers . My dear , you have nobody ill in the parish ; I will put up your things , and see you off to - morrow . We will dine late on Friday , to suit the coach ; and you will be quite fit for Sunday work again , if you keep up your legs on a chair all Saturday . "
180376	180385	180386	180387	Mr. Twemlow	299	" If ever I saw a straightforward man , "
180392	180431	180386	180387	Mr. Twemlow	299	" it was poor Percival Shargeloes . He is gone to a better world , my dear . And if he continued to be amenable to law , this is not a criminal , but a civil case . "
180432	180488	180064	180066	this good lady	10334	" A nice case of civility , Joshua ! But you always stand up for your sex . Does the coach take people to a better world ? A stout gentleman , like him , was seen inside the coach , muffled up in a cravat of three colours , and eating at frequent intervals . "
180489	180526	180386	180387	Mr. Twemlow	299	" The very thing poor Percival never did . That disposes to my mind of that foolish story . My dear , when all truth comes to light , you will do justice to his memory . "
180527	180575	180064	180066	this good lady	10334	" Yes , I dare say . But I should like to do it now . If you entertain any dark ideas , it is your duty to investigate them . Also to let me share them , Joshua , as I have every right to do . "
180689	180698	180699	180699	he	909	" I will speak to the fellow myself , "
180709	180722	180699	180699	he	909	" and judge from his manner what next I ought to do . "
181176	181179	181181	181182	the Rector	909	" Oh ! "
181200	181239	181185	181185	he	909	" oh , I hope you have not hurt yourself . No doubt it was my fault . Why , Dolly ! What a hurry you are in ! And all alone all alone , almost after dark ! "
181240	181254	181255	181256	Miss Dolly	277	" To be sure ; and that makes me in such a hurry ; "
181262	181276	181255	181256	Miss Dolly	277	" But I suppose I am safe in my father 's own grounds . "
181277	181287	181288	181289	Mr. Twemlow	299	" From everybody , except yourself , my dear , "
181294	181323	181288	181289	Mr. Twemlow	299	" Is your father aware , does your sister know , that you are at this distance from the house after dark , and wholly without a companion ? "
181324	181378	181185	181185	he	909	" It is not after dark , Mr. Twemlow ; although it is getting darker than I meant it to be . I beg your pardon for terrifying you . I hope you will meet with no other perils ! Good - night ! Or at least I mean , good - afternoon ! "
181379	181384	181386	181387	Mr. Twemlow	299	" The brazen creature ! "
181397	181530	181185	181185	he	909	" Not even to offer me any excuse ! But I suppose she had no fib handy . She will come to no good , I am very much afraid . Maria told me that she was getting very wilful ; but I had no idea that it was quite so bad as this . I am sorry for poor Scudamore , who thinks her such an angel . I wonder if Carne is at the bottom of this ? There is nothing too bad for that dark young man . I shall ascertain at any rate whether he is in the village . But unless I look sharp I shall be too late to meet him . Oh , I ca n't walk so fast as I did ten years ago . "
181687	181694	181696	181696	Carne	271	" No time for anything now , "
181698	181733	181696	181696	Carne	271	" too late already . Do you want my money ? You are come to the wrong man for that ; but the right one , I can tell you , for a bullet . "
181734	181786	181838	181839	the Rector	909	" Caryl , it is I , your uncle Twemlow , or at any rate the husband of your aunt . Put up your pistol , and speak to me a minute . I have something important to say to you . And I never can find you at the castle . "
181787	181798	181799	181799	Carne	356	" Then be quick , sir , if you please ; "
181810	181822	181799	181799	Carne	356	" I have little time to spare . Out with it . "
181823	181836	181838	181839	the Rector	909	" You were riding very slowly for a man in a hurry , "
181846	181906	181838	181839	the Rector	909	" But I will not keep you long , young man . For some good reasons of your own you have made a point of avoiding us , your nearest relatives in this country , and to whom you addressed yourself before you landed in a manner far more becoming . Have I ever pressed my attentions upon you ? "
181907	181942	181799	181799	Carne	356	" No , I confess that you have not done that . You perceived as a gentleman how little there was in common between the son of a devoted Catholic and a heretic clergyman . "
181943	181952	181953	181954	Mr. Twemlow	299	" That is one way to put it , "
181969	182076	181961	181961	his	299	" but I was not aware that you had strong religious views . However that may be , we should have many things in common , as Englishmen , at a time like this . But what I came to speak of is not that . We can still continue to get on without you , although we would rather have met with friendly feeling and candour , as becomes relatives . But little as you know of us , you must be well aware that your cousin Eliza was engaged to be married to a gentleman from London , Mr. Percival Shargeloes , and that he "
182077	182141	182254	182255	Mr. Twemlow	299	" I am sure I wish her all happiness , and congratulate you , my dear sir , as well as my aunt Maria . I shall call , as soon as possible , to offer my best wishes . It was very kind of you to tell me . Goodnight , sir , good - night ! There is a shower coming . "
182142	182145	182147	182148	the Rector	909	" But , "
182168	182180	182147	182148	the Rector	909	" Shargeloes has disappeared . What have you done with him ? "
182197	182213	182214	182214	he	356	" Try to explain yourself , my dear sir . Try to connect your ideas , "
182217	182239	182214	182214	he	356	" and offer me the benefit another time . My horse is impatient ; he may strike you with his foot . "
182240	182253	182254	182255	Mr. Twemlow	299	" If he does , I shall strike him upon the head , "
182264	182350	182254	182255	Mr. Twemlow	299	" It will be better for you to hear me out . Otherwise I shall procure a search - warrant , and myself examine your ruins , of which I know every crick and cranny . And your aunt Maria shall come with me , who knows every stone even better than you do . That would be a very different thing from an overhauling by Captain Stubbard . I think we should find a good many barrels and bales that had paid no duty . "
182351	182356	182358	182358	Carne	356	" My dear uncle , "
182370	182495	182358	182358	Carne	356	" that is no concern of yours ; you have no connection with the Revenue ; and I am sure that Aunt Maria would be loth to help in pulling down the family once more . But do as you please . I am accustomed to ill fortune . Only I should like to know what this is about poor Cousin Eliza . If any man has wronged her , leave the case to me . You have no son now , and the honour of the family shall not suffer in my hands . I will throw up everything , busy as I am , to make such a rascal bite the dust . And Eliza so proud , and so upright herself ! "
182496	182499	182507	182507	he	2087	" Caryl , "
182516	182593	182507	182507	he	2087	" you know more , I see , than you liked to show at first , doubtless through goodwill to us . Your dear aunt wished to keep the matter quiet , for the sake of poor Eliza , and her future chances . But I said No . Let us have it all out . If there is wrong , we have suffered , not done it . Concealment is odious to every honest mind . "
182594	182609	182358	182358	Carne	356	" Deeply , deeply odious . Upon that point there can be no two opinions "
182618	182694	182616	182617	the Rector	909	" but surely this man , whatever his name is Charleygoes must have been hiding from you something in his own history . Probably he had a wife already . City men often do that when young , and then put their wives somewhere when they get rich , and pay visits , and even give dinners , as if they were bachelors to be sought after . Was Charleygoes that sort of a man ? "
182695	182891	182616	182617	the Rector	909	" His name is ' Shargeloes , ' a name well known , as I am assured , in the highest quarters . And he certainly was not sought after by us , but came to me with an important question bearing on ichthyology . He may be a wanderer , as you suggest , and as all the ladies seem to think . But my firm belief is to the contrary . And my reason for asking you about him is a very clear one . He had met you twice , and felt interest in you as a future member of our family . You had never invited him to the castle ; and the last intention he expressed in my hearing was to call upon you without one . Has he met with an accident in your cellars ? Or have your dogs devoured him ? He carried a good deal of flesh , in spite of all he could do to the contrary ; and any man naturally might endeavour to hush up such an incident . Tell me the truth , Caryl . And we will try to meet it . "
182892	182977	182507	182507	he	2087	" My two dogs who would never eat any one , though they might pull down a stranger , and perhaps pretend to bite him arrived here the first week in January . When did Charleygoes disappear ? I am not up in dates , but it must have been weeks and weeks before that time . And I must have heard of it , if it had happened . I may give you my honour that Orso and Leo have not eaten Charleygoes . "
182978	183057	182616	182617	the Rector	909	" You speak too lightly of a man in high position , who would have been Lord Mayor of London , if he had never come to Springhaven . But living or dead , he shall never be that now . Can you answer me , in the same straightforward manner , as to an accident in your cellars ; which , as a gentleman upon a private tour , he had clearly no right to intrude upon ? "
183058	183101	182616	182617	the Rector	909	" I can answer you quite as clearly . Nothing accidental has happened in my cellars . You may come and see them , if you have any doubt about it . And you need not apply for a search - warrant . "
183102	183110	183112	183113	the uncle	4986	" God forbid , my dear fellow , "
183115	183177	183112	183113	the uncle	4986	" that I should intrude upon any little matters of delicacy , such as are apt to arise between artificial laws and gentlemen who happen to live near the sea , and to have large places that require restoring ! I shall go home with a lighter heart . There is nothing in this world that brings the comfort of straightforwardness . "
183206	183211	182616	182617	the Rector	909	" the cry of wolf "
184249	184264	184241	184241	he	429	" Good - bye , my dear friends ; I am breaking my parole . "
184393	184398	184400	184400	Scudamore	429	" Understand this well , "
184402	184533	184400	184400	Scudamore	429	" if I discover any treachery on the part of my own countrymen , I shall not be able to stop here on the terms that have been allowed me . Whatever the plan may be , I shall feel as if I were a party to it , if I accepted my free range and swallowed my suspicions . With your proceedings I do not meddle , according to fair compact , and the liberal conditions offered . But to see my own countrymen playing my country false is more than I could stand . You know more of such things than I do . But if you were an Englishman , could you endure to stand by and hide treachery , for the sake of your own comfort ? "
184534	184541	184542	184543	Captain Desportes	446	" Beyond a doubt , no , "
184552	184647	184547	184547	his	446	" in such a case I should throw up my parole . But a mere suspicion does not justify an act so ungracious to the commander , and personally so unkind to me . I hoped that bright eyes might persuade you to forego hard knocks , and wear none but gentle chains among us . Nature intended you for a Frenchman . You have the gay heart , and the easy manner , and the grand philosophy of our great nation . Your name is Blyth , and I know what that intends . "
184736	184744	184746	184746	Desportes	446	" My faith ! I scarcely know , "
184748	184865	184746	184746	Desportes	446	" I have never had such a case before . But I think you must give me a written notice , signed by yourself and by M. Jalais , and allow a week to pass , and then , unless you have heard from me , present yourself to the commandant of the nearest post , which must be , I suppose , at Etaples . Rather a rough man he is ; and I fear you will have reason for regret . The duty will then remain with him . But I beg you , my dear friend , to continue as you are . Tush , it is nothing but some smuggler 's work . "
186145	186155	186157	186157	Scuddy	328	" He is waiting for an interview with somebody , "
186159	186193	186157	186157	Scuddy	328	" if I could only get down to that little shanty , perhaps I should hear some fine treason . The wind is the right way to bring me every word he says . "
186662	186672	186673	186673	he	5148	" Are all your men well out of earshot ? "
186685	186856	186680	186680	Carne	356	" Now you will be satisfied at length . You have long been impatient . It is useless to deny it . All is arranged , and all comes to a head within three months , and perhaps within two . Only four men will know it besides yourself , and three of those four are commanders of my fleet . A short time will be occupied in misleading those British ships that beleaguer us ; then we concentrate ours , and command the Channel ; if only for three days , that will be enough . I depart for Italy in three days or in four , to increase the security of the enemy . But I shall return , without a word to any one , and as fast as horses can lay belly to the ground , when I hear that our ships have broken out . I shall command the invasion , and it will be for England to find a man to set against me . "
186857	186869	186870	186870	Carne	356	" England will have difficulty , sire , in doing that , "
186889	186935	186879	186879	he	356	" If the Continent can not do it , how can the poor England ? Once let your Majesty land , and all is over . But what are your Majesty 's orders for me ? And where do you propose to make the landing ? "
186936	186947	186948	186948	Napoleon	385	" Never ask more than one question at a time , "
186956	187042	186952	186952	his	385	" my orders to you are to return at once . Prepare your supplies for a moment 's notice . Through private influence of some fair lady , you have command of the despatches of that officer at Springport , who has the control of the naval forces there . Ha ! what was that ? I heard a sound up yonder . Hasten up , and see if there is any listener . It seemed to be there , where the wood grows thick . "
187225	187228	187235	187235	Napoleon	385	" No , "
187241	187243	187235	187235	Napoleon	385	" no "
187247	187249	187235	187235	Napoleon	385	" yes "
187252	187389	187235	187235	Napoleon	385	" no , it is not to be done like that . You will await your instructions , and not move until you receive them from my own hand . Make no attempt to surprise anybody or anything , until I have ten thousand men ashore . Ten thousand will in six hours attain to fifty thousand , if the shore proves to be as you describe ; so great is the merit of flat - bottomed boats . Your duty will be to leave the right surprise to us , and create a false one among the enemy . This you must do in the distance of the West , as if my Brest fleet were ravaging there , and perhaps destroying Plymouth . You are sure that you can command the signals for this ? "
187390	187422	187235	187235	Napoleon	385	" Sire , I know everything as if I sat among it . I can do as I please with the fair secretary ; and her father is an ancient fool . "
187423	187672	187235	187235	Napoleon	385	" Then success is more easy than I wish to have it , because it will not make good esteem . If Nelson comes at all , he will be too late , as he generally is too early . London will be in our hands by the middle of July at the latest , probably much earlier , and then Captain Carne shall name his own reward . Meanwhile forget not any word of what I said . Make the passage no more . You will not be wanted here . Your services are far more important where you are . You may risk the brave Charron , but not yourself . Send over by the 20th of May a letter to me , under care of Decres , to be opened by no hand but mine , upon my return from Italy , and let the messengers wait for my reply . Among them must be the young man who knows the coast , and we will detain him for pilot . My reply will fix the exact date of our landing , and then you will despatch , through the means at your command , any English force that might oppose our landing , to the West , where we shall create a false alarm . Is all this clear to you ? You are not stupid . The great point is to do all at the right time , having consideration of the weather . "
187673	187697	187698	187698	Napoleon	385	" All is clear , and shall be carried out clearly , to the best of your Majesty 's humble servant 's power . "
187769	187869	187870	187870	Scudamore	429	" How shall I get out of this parole ? Or shall I break it , instead of getting out ? Which shall I think of first , my honour , or my country ? The safety of millions , or the pride of one ? An old Roman would have settled it very simply . But a Christian can not do things so . Thank God there is no hurry , for a few days yet ! But I must send a letter to Desportes this very night . Then I must consider about waiting for a week . "
188248	188251	188247	188250	the " fair secretary	10817	" fair secretary "
189005	189009	189047	189053	the mighty host for leagues and leagues	5198	" Now or never "
189332	189343	189345	189345	he	623	" But I must not expose you to the risk , "
189347	189438	189345	189345	he	623	" of heavy fine and imprisonment . I shall have to say good - bye to all your goodness in an hour . And I shall not even allow you to know what road I take , lest you should be blamed for sending my pursuers on the wrong one . But search my room in three days ' time , and you will find a packet to pay for something which I must steal for the present . I pray you , ask nothing , for your own sake . "
190173	190183	190161	190161	his	429	" The fisherman , Auguste Baudry , of Montreuil ! "
191304	191312	191264	191264	he	861	" I wish you well all round , "
191315	191324	191264	191264	he	861	" Here 's a guinea apiece for you . "
191880	191893	191895	191898	the heartless Captain Scuddy	328	" You are welcome to groan , if you do n't strain , "
192737	192745	192775	192777	the gay Charron	5346	" Oh Lord , receive my spirit ! "
192751	192773	192775	192777	the gay Charron	5346	" A man came out of the sea to - day , and made me believe we were all found out , "
192793	192832	192775	192777	the gay Charron	5346	" I never beheld a more strange - looking creature as the owner of our human face divine , as some of your poets have found to say . He has hair from his head all down to here "
192852	192902	192775	192777	the gay Charron	5346	" and his clothes were so thin that one was able to see through them , and the tint of his face was of roasted sugar , such as it is not to obtain in England . A fine place for fat things , but not for thin ones . "
192903	192912	192930	192930	he	5349	" My friend , you arouse my curiosity , "
192937	193000	192930	192930	he	5349	" you are always apprehensive about detection , of which I have ceased to entertain all fear , during the short time that remains . This stranger of yours must have been very wet , if he had just appeared out of the sea . Was it that which made his clothes transparent , like those of the higher class of ladies ? "
193001	193056	192930	192930	he	5349	" You have not the right understanding of words . He was appeared out of the sea , but the wood of a boat was spread between them . He was as dry as I am ; and that is saying much , with nothing but this squeezing of bad apples for to drink . "
193057	193094	192930	192930	he	5349	" Ah , we shall have better soon . What an impatient throat it is ! Well , what became of this transparent man , made of burnt sugar , and with hair below his belt ? "
193095	193242	192930	192930	he	5349	" I tell you that you take it in a very different way . But he was a long man , as long almost as you are , and with much less of indolence in the moving of his legs . It was not sincerely wise for me to exhibit myself , in the land . I was watching for a signal from the sea , and a large ship , not of the navy but of merchants , was hanging off about a league and delaying for her boat . For this reason I prevented him from seeing me , and that created difficulty of my beholding him . But he was going along the basin of the sea towards Springhaven ' Springport ' it is designated by the Little Corporal ; ah ha , how the language of the English comes left to him ! "
193243	193325	192930	192930	he	5349	" And how right it comes to you , my friend , through your fine self - denial in speaking it with me ! It is well for our cause that it is not sincerely wise for you to exhibit yourself in the land , or we should have you making sweet eyes at English young ladies , and settling down to roast beef and nut - brown ale . Fie , then , my friend ! where is your patriotism ? "
193326	193332	193334	193335	the Frenchman	1854	" These English young ladies , "
193339	193440	193334	193335	the Frenchman	1854	" are very fine , in my opinion very fine indeed ; and they could be made to dress , which is sincerely an external thing . By occasion , I have seen the very most belle , and charming and adorable of all the creatures ever made by the good God . And if she was to say to me , ' Abandon France , my Captain , and become my good husband ' and she has the money also the fair France would go to the bottom , and the good ship Charron hoist the Union - jack . "
193441	193446	192930	192930	he	5349	" This becomes serious : "
193461	193493	193447	193447	Carne	541	" I shall have to confine you in the Yellow Jar , my friend . But what young lady has bewitched you so , and led your most powerful mind astray ? "
193494	193541	193334	193335	the Frenchman	1854	" I will tell you . I will make no secret of it . You have none of those lofty feelings , but you will be able in another to comprehend them . It is the daughter of the Coast - Defender Admiral Charles Sir Darling . "
193542	193564	193447	193447	Carne	541	" Admiral Darling has two daughters . Which of them has the distinguished honour of winning the regard of Captain Charron ? "
193565	193615	193334	193335	the Frenchman	1854	" If there are two , it is so much more better . If I succeed not with one , I will try with the other . But the one who has made me captive for the present is the lady with the dark hair done up like this . "
193664	193674	193659	193659	he	541	" My friend , that is the elder daughter . "
193675	193686	193687	193688	the Frenchman	1854	" I have some knowledge of the laws of England , "
193693	193771	193687	193688	the Frenchman	1854	" the elder will have the most money , and I am not rich , though I am courageous . In the confusion that ensues I shall have the very best chance of commending myself ; and I confide in your honourable feeling to give me the push forward by occasion . Say , is it well conceived , my friend ? We never shall conquer these Englishmen , but we may be triumphant with their ladies . "
193772	193782	193783	193783	Carne	541	" It is a most excellent scheme of invasion , "
193792	193828	193787	193787	his	541	" and you may rely on me for what you call the push forward , if a Frenchman ever needs it with a lady . But I wish to hear more about that brown man . "
193829	193872	193787	193787	his	541	" I can tell you no more . But the matter is strange . Perhaps he was visiting the fat Captain Stoobar . I feel no solicitude concerning him with my angel . She would never look twice at such a savage . "
193990	194004	194005	194005	she	463	" Oh , Mr. Erle , is it you , or your ghostie ? "
194019	194039	194005	194005	she	463	" Do ' e speak , for God 's sake , if He have given the power to ' e. "
194040	194057	194058	194059	Erle Twemlow	473	" He has almost taken it away again , so far as the English language goes , "
194080	194112	194058	194059	Erle Twemlow	473	" but I am picking up a little . Shake hands , Kezia , and then you will know me . Though I have not quite recovered that art as yet . "
194113	194119	194121	194121	Zebedee	278	" Oh , Mr. Erle ! "
194137	194283	194287	194287	his	5362	" how many a time I 've had you on my knees , afore I was blessed with any of my own , and a bad sort of blessing the best of 'em proves . Not that I would listen to a word again ' him . I suppose you never did happen to run again ' my Dan'el , in any of they furrin parts , from the way they makes the hair grow . I did hear tell of him over to Pebbleridge ; but not likely , so nigh to his own mother , and never come no nigher . And if they furrin parts puts on the hair so heavily , who could ' a known him to Pebbleridge ? They never was like we be . They 'd as lief tell a lie as look at you , over there . "
194368	194382	194383	194384	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" But Lor bless me , sir , I never thought of you ! "
194393	194420	194383	194384	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" What did Parson say , and your mother , and Miss Faith ? It must ' a been better than a play to see them . "
194421	194479	194383	194384	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" Not one of them knows a word about it yet ; nor anybody in Springhaven , except you , Kezia . You were as good as my nurse , you know ; I have never had a chance of writing to them , and I want you to help me to let them know it slowly . "
194480	194576	194383	194384	Mrs. Tugwell	463	" Oh , Mr. Erle , what a lovely young woman your Miss Faith is grown up by now ! Some thinks more of Miss Dolly , but , to my mind , you may as well put a mackerel before a salmon , for the sake of the stripes and the glittering . Now what can I do to make you decent , sir , for them duds and that hair is barbarious ? My Tabby and Debby will be back in half an hour , and them growing up into young maidens now . "
194810	194823	194824	194825	Mr. Twemlow	299	" Another trouble , probably ; there is nothing now but trouble , "
194838	194916	194830	194830	he	299	" I wish I could only guess what I can have done to deserve all these trials , as I become less fit to bear them . I would never have come to this lonely spot , except that it may be about Shargeloes . Everything now is turned upside down ; but the Lord knows best , and I must bear it . Sir , who are you ? And what do you want me for ? "
195023	195067	195002	195002	He	299	" Father , you ought to know me , although you have grown much stouter in my absence ; and perhaps I am thinner than I used to be . But the climate disagreed with me , until I got to like it . "
195068	195082	195083	195084	The Rector	909	" Erle ! Do you mean to say you are my boy Erle ? "
195091	195127	195083	195084	The Rector	909	" Do n't think of touching me . You are hair all over , and I dare say never had a comb . I wo n't believe a word of it until you prove it . "
195128	195141	195142	195144	The young man	861	" Well , mother will know me , if you do n't . "
195166	195232	195142	195144	The young man	861	" I thought that you would have been glad to see me ; and I managed to bring a good many presents ; only they are gone on to London . They could not be got at , to land them with me ; but Captain Southcombe will be sure to send them . You must not suppose , because I am empty - handed now "
195233	195238	195240	195241	the father	807	" My dear son , "
195246	195333	195240	195241	the father	807	" do you think that your welcome depends upon presents ? You have indeed fallen into savage ways . Come , and let me examine you through your hair ; though the light is scarcely strong enough now to go through it . To think that you should be my own Erle , alive after such a time , and with such a lot of hair ! Only , if there is any palm - oil on it this is my last new coat but one . "
195334	195384	195142	195144	The young man	861	" No , father , nothing that you ever can have dreamed of . Something that will make you a bishop , if you like , and me a member of the House of Lords . But I did not find it out myself which makes success more certain . "
195385	195449	195240	195241	the father	807	" They have taught you some great truths , my dear boy . The man who begins a thing never gets on . But I am so astonished that I know not what I say . I ought to have thanked the Lord long ago . Have you got a place without any hair upon it large enough for me to kiss you ? "
195488	195494	195496	195498	the old man	1354	" Let us go home , "
195511	195576	195496	195498	the old man	1354	" but you must stay outside until I come to fetch you . I feel a little anxious , my dear boy , as to how your dear mother will get over it . She has never been strong since the bad news came about you . And somebody else has to be considered . But that must stand over till to - morrow . "
195653	195661	195663	195663	Carne	541	" Now I will have my revenge , "
195665	195724	195663	195663	Carne	541	" on all who have outraged and plundered me . Crows carrion - crows I will turn them into owls without a nest . Prowling owls , to come blinking even now at the last of my poor relics ! Charron , what did that fellow say to old Jerry , the day I tied the dogs up ? "
195725	195871	195663	195663	Carne	541	" He said , my dear friend , that he missed from the paintings which he had taken to his house the most precious of them all the picture of your dear grandmother , by a man whose name it is hard to pronounce , but a Captain in the British Army , very much fond of beloving and painting all the most beautiful ladies ; and since he had painted the mother of Vash Vash the man that conquered England in America all his work was gone up to a wonderful price , and old Sheray should have one guinea if he would exhibit to him where to find it . Meedle or Beedle he had set his heart on getting it . He declared by the good God that he would have it , and that you had got it under a tombstone . "
195872	195981	195663	195663	Carne	541	" A sample of their persecutions ! You know that I have never seen it , nor even heard of the Captain Middleton who went on his rovings from Springhaven . And , again , about my own front - door , or rather the door of my family for some four centuries , because it was carved as they can not carve now , it was put into that vile Indenture . I care very little for my ancestors benighted Britons of the county type but these things are personal insults to me . I seldom talk about them , and I will not do so now . "
195982	196083	195663	195663	Carne	541	" My Captain , you should talk much about it . That would be the good relief to your extensive mind . Revenge is not of the bright French nature ; but the sky of this island procreates it . My faith ! how I would rage at England , if it were not for the people , and their daughters ! We shall see ; in a few days more we shall astonish the fat John Bull ; and then his little kittens what do you call them ? calves of an ox , will come running to us . "
196084	196091	196093	196093	Carne	541	" Enough of your foolish talk , "
196095	196166	196093	196093	Carne	541	" The women are as resolute as the men . Even when we have taken London , not an English woman will come near us , until all the men have yielded . Go down to your station and watch for the boat . I expect an important despatch to - night . But I can not stay here for the chance of it . I have business in Springhaven . "
196485	196496	196461	196462	the other	893	" Have you any business with me , good sir ? "
196517	196539	196551	196552	the stranger	1556	" If so , I must ask you to be quick . And perhaps you will tell me who you are . "
196540	196549	196551	196552	the stranger	1556	" I think that you are Caryl Carne , "
196608	196620	196621	196621	he	356	" You know me . But I do n't know you , "
196633	196639	196641	196642	the other	893	" Be in no hurry , "
196646	196685	196641	196642	the other	893	" the weather is fine , and time plentiful . I hope to have much pleasant knowledge of you . I have the honour to be your first cousin , Erle Twemlow . Shake hands with your kinsman . "
196725	196735	196737	196737	Twemlow	473	" I was going up to call on you , "
196756	196844	196748	196748	he	473	" I feel a deep interest in your fortunes , and hope to improve them enormously . You shall hear all about it when I come up . I have passed four years in the wilds of Africa , where no white man ever trod before , and I have found out things no white man knows . We call those people savages , but they know a great deal more than we do . Shall I call to - morrow , and have a long talk ? "
196845	196849	196851	196851	Carne	356	" I fear , "
196866	196939	196851	196851	Carne	356	" that I shall have no time for a week or two . I am engaged upon important business now , which will occupy my whole attention . Let me see ! You are staying at the rectory , I suppose . The best plan will be for me to let you know when I can afford the pleasure of receiving you . In a fortnight , or three weeks at the latest "
196940	197006	196748	196748	he	473	" Very well . I am never in a hurry . And I want to go to London to see about my things . But I dare say you will not object to my roving about the old castle now and then . I loved the old place as a boy , and I know every crick and cranny and snake - hole in it . "
197007	197190	197208	197208	his	473	" How glad they must have been to see you restored from the dead , and with such rich discoveries ! But you must be more careful , my good cousin , and create no more anxiety . Glad as I shall be to see you , when time allows that indulgence , I must not encourage you to further rovings , which might end in your final disappearance . Two boar - hounds , exceedingly fierce and strong , and compelled by my straitened circumstances to pick up their own living , are at large on my premises night and day , to remonstrate with my creditors . We fear that they ate a man last night , who had stolen a valuable picture , and was eager for another by the same distinguished artist . His boots and hat were found unhurt ; but of his clothes not a shred remained , to afford any pattern for enquiry . What would my feelings be if Aunt Maria arrived hysterically in the pony - carriage , and at great personal risk enquired "
197191	197197	197208	197208	his	473	" I fear no dogs , "
197212	197305	197306	197307	Erle Twemlow	473	" I can bring any dog to lick my feet . But I fear any man who sinks lower than a dog , by obtaining a voice and speaking lies with it . If you wish , for some reason of your own , to have nought to do with me , you should have said so ; and I might have respected you afterwards . But flimsy excuses and trumpery lies belong to the lowest race of savages , who live near the coast , and have been taught by Frenchmen . "
197374	197381	197382	197382	he	356	" Well done , Mr. Savage ! "
197393	197475	197382	197382	he	356	" You and I are accustomed to the opposite extremes of society , and the less we meet , the better . When a barbarian insults me , I take it as a foul word from a clodhopper , which does not hurt me , but may damage his own self - respect , if he cherishes such an illusion . Perhaps you will allow me to ride on , while you curb your very natural curiosity about a civilized gentleman . "
197524	197531	197533	197534	Caryl Carne	356	" Everything goes against me now , "
197551	197581	197537	197537	he	356	" I want to be cool as a cucumber , and that insolent villain has made pepper of me . What devil sent him here at such a time ? "
197666	197674	197676	197676	Dolly	632	" So you are come at last ! "
197678	197715	197676	197676	Dolly	632	" No one who knows me keeps me waiting , because I am not accustomed to it . I expect to be called for at any moment , by matters of real importance not like this . "
197716	197724	197726	197726	Carne	356	" Your mind is a little disturbed , "
197744	197759	197729	197729	he	356	" is it because of the brown and hairy man just returned from Africa ? "
197760	197789	197676	197676	Dolly	632	" Not altogether . But that may be something . He is not a man to be laughed at . I wish you could have seen my sister . "
197790	197837	197676	197676	Dolly	632	" I would rather see you ; and I have no love of savages . He is my first cousin , and that affords me a domestic right to object to him . As a brother - in - law I will have none of him . "
197838	197842	197844	197844	Dolly	632	" You forget , "
197861	197896	197855	197855	he	5418	" that a matter of that sort depends upon us , and our father , and not upon the gentlemen . If the gentlemen do n't like it , they can always go away . "
197897	197937	197676	197676	Dolly	632	" How can they go , when they are chained up like a dog ? Women may wander from this one to that , because they have nothing to bind them ; but a man is of steadfast material . "
197938	198027	197676	197676	Dolly	632	" Erle Twemlow is , at any rate though it is hard to see his material through his hair ; but that must come off , and I mean to do it . He is the best - natured man I have ever yet known , except one ; and that one had got nothing to shave . Men never seem to understand about their hair , and the interest we feel concerning it . But it does not matter very much , compared to their higher principles . "
198028	198042	198043	198043	Carne	356	" That is where I carry every vote , of whatever sex you please "
198055	198082	198046	198047	this girl	5419	" Anybody can see what I am . Straightforward , and ready to show my teeth . Why should an honest man live in a bush ? "
198083	198197	197676	197676	Dolly	632	" Faith likes it very much ; though she always used to say that it did seem so unchristian . Could you manage to come and meet him , Caryl ? We shall have a little dinner on Saturday , I believe , that every one may see Erle Twemlow . His beloved parents will be there , who are gone quite wild about him . Father will be at home for once ; and the Marquis of Southdown , and some officers , and Captain Stubbard and his wife will come , and perhaps my brother Frank , who admires you so much . You shall have an invitation in the morning . "
198198	198206	198207	198207	Carne	356	" Such delights are not for me , "
198215	198255	198207	198207	Carne	356	" unhappily my time is too important . But perhaps these festivities will favour me with the chance of a few words with my darling . How I long to see her , and how little chance I get ! "
198256	198315	197676	197676	Dolly	632	" Because , when you get it , you spend three - quarters of the time in arguing , and the rest in finding fault . I am sure I go as far as anybody can ; and I wo n't take you into my father 's Roundhouse , because I do n't think it would be proper . "
198316	198431	198432	198432	She	5420	" Ladies alone understand such subjects ; and a gentleman is thankful that they do . I am quite content to be outside the Roundhouse so called because it is square , perhaps though the wind is gone back to the east again , as it always does now in an English summer , according to a man who has studied the subject Zebedee Tugwell , the captain of the fleet . Dolly , beloved , and most worthy to be more so , clear your bright mind from all false impressions , whose only merit is that they are yours , and allow it to look clearly at a matter of plain sense . "
198464	198473	198461	198461	she	5420	" That is very nice . Go on . "
198474	198572	197676	197676	Dolly	632	" Well , beauty , you know that I trust you in everything , because of your very keen discretion , and freedom from stupid little prejudice . I have been surprised at times , when I thought of it in your absence , that any one so young , who has never been through any course of political economy , should be able to take such a clear view of subjects which are far beyond the intellect of even the oldest ladies . But it must be your brother ; no doubt he has helped you to "
198573	198577	198579	198581	the innocent Dolly	448	" Not he ! "
198587	198622	198461	198461	she	5420	" I rather look down upon his reasoning powers ; though I never could make such a pretty tink of rhymes like the bells of the sheep when the ground is full of turnips . "
198623	198631	198633	198633	Carne	356	" He approves of your elevated views , "
198646	198758	198633	198633	Carne	356	" they may not have come from him , because they are your own , quite as much as his poetry is his . But he perceives their truth , and he knows that they must prevail . In a year or two we shall be wondering , sweet Dolly , when you and I sit side by side , as the stupid old King and Queen do now , that it ever has been possible for narrow - minded nonsense to prevail as it did until we rose above it . We shall be admired as the benefactors , not of this country only , but of the whole world . "
198783	198803	198776	198776	She	277	" That sounds wonderfully fine ; but what does it mean , and how are we to work it ? "
198843	198854	198855	198855	she	277	" You wish me to help you in some way , "
198858	198886	198855	198855	she	277	" your object is sure to be good ; and you trust me in everything , because of my discretion . Then why not tell me everything ? "
198887	198892	198893	198893	Carne	356	" You know everything , "
198905	198994	198893	198893	Carne	356	" My object is the largest that a man can have ; and until I saw you , there was not the least taint of self - interest in my proceedings . But now it is not for the universe alone , for the grandeur of humanity , and the triumph of peace , that I have to strive , but also for another little somebody , who has come I am ashamed to say to outweigh all the rest in the balance of my too tender heart . "
199031	199051	199052	199052	Carne	356	" Beauty , it is plain enough to you , though it might not be so to stupid people , "
199077	199123	199056	199056	he	356	" that bold measures are sometimes the only wise ones . Many English girls would stand aghast to hear that it was needful for the good of England that a certain number , a strictly limited number , of Frenchmen should land upon this coast . "
199124	199132	199134	199134	Dolly	277	" I should rather think they would ! "
199136	199152	199134	199134	Dolly	277	" and I would be one of them you may be quite sure of that . "
199153	199166	199167	199167	Carne	356	" For a moment you might , until you came to understand . "
199212	199404	199405	199405	Carne	356	" But every safeguard and every guarantee that can be demanded by the wildest prudence will be afforded before a step is taken . In plain truth , a large mind is almost shocked at such deference to antique prejudice . But the feelings of old women must be considered ; and our measures are fenced with such securities that even the most timid must be satisfied . There must be a nominal landing , of course , of a strictly limited number , and they must be secured for a measurable period from any ill - judged interruption . But the great point of all is to have no blood - guiltiness , no outbreak of fanatic natives against benefactors coming in the garb of peace . A truly noble offer of the olive - branch must not be misinterpreted . It is the finest idea that has ever been conceived ; and no one possessing a liberal mind can help admiring the perfection of this plan . For the sake of this country , and the world , and ourselves , we must contribute our little share , darling . "
199447	199457	199458	199458	he	356	" It is useless to dream of drawing back , "
199461	199556	199458	199458	he	356	" my beauty , and my poor outcast self , are in the same boat , and must sail on to success such success as there never has been before , because it will bless the whole world , as well as secure our own perfect happiness . You will be more than the Queen of England . Statues of you will be set up everywhere ; and where could the sculptors find such another model ? I may count upon your steadfast heart , I know , and your wonderful quickness of perception . "
199557	199607	199405	199405	Carne	356	" Yes , if I could only see that everything was right . But I feel that I ought to consult somebody of more experience in such things . My father , for instance , or my brother Frank , or even Mr. Twemlow , or perhaps Captain Stubbard . "
199608	199628	199629	199629	Carne	356	" If you had thought of it a little sooner , and allowed me time to reason with them , "
199637	199849	199629	199629	Carne	356	" that would have been the very thing I should have wished , as taking a great responsibility from me . But alas , it would be fatal now . The main object now is to remove all chance of an ill - judged conflict , which would ruin all good feeling , and cost many valuable lives , perhaps even that of your truly gallant father . No , my Dolly , you must not open your beautiful lips to any one . The peace and happiness of the world depend entirely upon your discretion . All will be arranged to a nicety , and a happy result is certain . Only I must see you , about some small points , as well as to satisfy my own craving . On Saturday you have that dinner party , when somebody will sit by your side instead of me . How miserably jealous I shall be ! When the gentlemen are at their wine , you must console me by slipping away from the ladies , and coming to the window of the little room where your father keeps his papers . I shall quit everything and watch there for you among the shrubs , when it grows dark enough . "
199881	199899	199900	199900	he	619	" I have always had an idea that Ireland alone was the object they have in view , "
199907	200043	199900	199900	he	619	" and still believe that to be their ultimate destination that they i. e. , the Toulon fleet will now liberate the Ferrol squadron from Calder , make the round of the bay , and taking the Rochefort people with them , appear off Ushant , perhaps with 34 sail , there to be joined by 20 more . Cornwallis collecting his out - squadrons may have 30 and upwards . This appears to be a probable plan ; for unless it is to bring their great fleets and armies to some point of service some rash attempt at conquest they have been only subjecting them to chance of loss ; which I do not believe the Corsican would do , without the hope of an adequate reward . This summer is big with events . "
200091	200303	200076	200080	the same Vice - Admiral	5433	" Truly glad will I be to see you , and to give you my best opinion on the present state of affairs , which are in the highest degree intricate . But reasoning on the policy of the present French government , who never aim at little things while great objects are in view , I have considered the invasion of Ireland as the real mark and butt of all their operations . The flight to the West Indies was to take off the naval force , which is the great impediment to their undertaking . The Rochefort squadron 's return confirmed me . I think they will now collect their force at Ferrol which Calder tells me are in motion pick up those at Rochefort , who , I am told , are equally ready , and will make them above thirty sail ; and then , without going near Ushant or the Channel fleet , proceed to Ireland . Detachments must go from the Channel fleet to succour Ireland , when the Brest fleet 21 I believe of them will sail , either to another part of Ireland , or up the Channel a sort of force that has not been seen in those seas , perhaps ever . "
200317	200338	200076	200080	the same Vice - Admiral	5433	" following his own head , and so being much more correct in judgment than following the opinion of others , "
200378	200389	200390	200390	he	276	" Why have I gone on a goose - chase ? "
200393	200404	200390	200390	he	276	" because I have twice as many ears as eyes . "
200943	200970	200937	200937	he	385	" The English know not what is hanging over their ears . If we are masters of the passage for twelve hours , England is conquered . "
201839	201848	201850	201852	Mrs. Van Oort	641	" You will never get out of them , "
202068	202076	202202	202202	his	429	" the more haste the less speed . "
202107	202119	202120	202122	the young Englishman	5513	" What chance is there now of my doing any good ? "
202128	202198	202124	202124	himself	5513	" This place is again in the hands of the Dutch , and the English ships stand clear of it , or only receive supplies by stealth . I am friendless here , I am penniless ; and worst of all , if I even get a passage home , there will be no home left . Too late ! too late ! What use is there in striving ? "
202311	202319	202292	202294	the two men	5517	" Jack - in - the - box "
202582	202594	202596	202603	the one who knew most of the subject	5538	" You may wait weeks , or you may wait months , "
202605	202707	202596	202603	the one who knew most of the subject	5538	" we are very jealous of the English ships . That country swallows up the sea so . It has been forbidden to supply the English ships ; but for plenty money it is done sometimes ; but the finger must be placed upon the nose , and upon the two eyes what you call the guinea ; and in six hours where are they ? Swallowed up by the mist from the mountain . No , sir ! If you have the great money , it is very difficult . But if you have not that , it is impossible . "
202708	202733	202596	202603	the one who knew most of the subject	5538	" I have not the great money ; and the little money also has escaped from a quicksand in the bottom of my pocket . "
202734	202745	202746	202747	this gentleman	7490	" Then you will never get to England , sir , "
202752	202790	202746	202747	this gentleman	7490	" and unless I have been told things too severely , the best man that lives had better not go there , without a rock of gold in his pocket grand enough to fill a thousand quicksands . "
202893	202948	202878	202878	they	5545	" is to play , and he , understanding now the nature , of democracy , perceived that of all the many short - cuts to starvation , the one with the fewest elbows to it is to work . While he was meditating upon these points which persons of big words love to call "
202953	203099	203100	203100	Thy	5546	" his hat , now become a patent ventilator , sat according to custom on the back of his head , exposing his large calm forehead , and the kind honesty of his countenance . Then he started a little , for his nerves were not quite as strong as when they had good feeding , at the sudden sense of being scrutinized by the most piercing gaze he had ever encountered . The stranger was an old man of tall spare frame , wearing a shovel - hat and long black gown drawn in with a belt , and around his bare neck was a steel chain supporting an ebony cross . With a smile , which displayed the firm angles of his face , he addressed the young man in a language which Scudamore could not understand , but believed to be Portuguese . "
203135	203168	203121	203121	I	0	" Scudamore spoke the best Latin he could muster at a moment 's notice , for he saw that this gentleman was a Catholic priest , and probably therefore of good education . "
203180	203191	203174	203175	an Englishman	7125	" the stranger replied , in the same good tongue . "
203303	203513	203299	203301	the God omnipotent	5558	" After a few more words , he led the hapless and hungry Englishman to a quiet little cot which overlooked the noble bay , and itself was overlooked by a tall flag - staff bearing the colours of Portugal . Here in the first place he regaled his guest with the flank of a kid served with cucumber , and fruit gathered early , and some native wine , scarcely good enough for the Venusian bard , but as rich as ambrosia to Scudamore . Then he supplied him with the finest tobacco that ever ascended in spiral incense to the cloud - compelling Jove . At every soft puff , away flew the blue - devils , pagan , or Christian , or even scientific ; and the brightness of the sleep - forbidden eyes returned , and the sweetness of the smile so long gone hence in dread of trespass . Father Bartholomew , neither eating , drinking , nor smoking , till the sun should set for this was one of his fast - days was heartily pleased with his guest 's good cheer , and smiled with the large benevolence which a lean face expresses with more decision than a plump and jolly one . "
203520	203541	203542	203542	thou	5560	" he began again , in Latin more fluent and classical than the sailor could compass after Cicero thrown by , "
203612	203660	203661	203661	Man	6496	" Then Scudamore , sometimes hesitating and laughing at his own bad Latin , told as much of his story as was needful , striving especially to make clear the importance of his swift return , and his fear that even so it would be too late . "
203674	203692	203669	203670	the Lord	848	" the good priest answered , with a smile of courage refreshing the heart of the Englishman . "
203865	203865	203858	203860	that old man	5573	"
204247	204255	204257	204257	Carne	356	" Pest on this abominable early work ! "
204284	204332	204333	204333	He	356	" it is all very well for sailors , but too hard upon a quiet gentleman . Very likely that fellow wo n't come for two hours . What a cursed uncomfortable maggoty place ! But I 'll have put the sleep he has robbed me of . "
204366	204405	204333	204333	He	356	" Awake , my vigilant commander , and behold me ! Happy are the landsmen , to whom the stars bring sleep . I have not slept for three nights , and the fruits are here for you . "
204472	204480	204481	204481	he	356	" Sit down , my dear friend , "
204489	204517	204481	204481	he	356	" there is bread and meat here , and a bottle of good Macon . You are nearly always hungry , and you must be starved now . "
204556	204577	204578	204578	he	403	" In this matter , I should implore the tree to crush me , if my father were an Englishman , "
204581	204596	204578	204578	he	403	" but every one to his taste ; it is no affair of mine . "
204621	204630	204631	204631	he	356	" You are the brother of my toil , "
204634	204755	204631	204631	he	356	" and I will tell you as much as it is good for you to know . A few hours now will complete our enterprise . Napoleon is at Boulogne again , and even he can scarcely restrain the rush of the spirits he has provoked . The first Division is on board already , with a week 's supplies , and a thousand horses , ready to sail when a hand is held up . The hand will be held up at my signal , and that I shall trust you to convey to - night , as soon as I have settled certain matters . Where is that sullen young Tugwell ? What have you done with him ? "
204756	204767	204768	204768	Charron	403	" Wonderfully clever is your new device , my friend , "
204779	204854	204768	204768	Charron	403	" To vanquish the mind by a mind superior is a glory of high reason ; but to let it remain in itself and compel it to perform what is desired by the other , is a stroke of genius . And under your pharmacy he must do it that has been proved already . The idea was grand , very noble , magnificent . It never would have shown itself to my mind . "
204855	205018	204631	204631	he	356	" Probably not . When that has been accomplished , we will hang him for a traitor . But , my dear friend , I have sad news for you , even in this hour of triumph . The lady of your adoration , the Admiral 's eldest daughter , Faith , has recovered the man for whom she has waited four years , and she means to marry him . The father has given his consent , and her pride is beyond description . She has long loved a mystery what woman can help it ? And now she has one for life , a husband eclipsed in his own hair . My Renaud , all rivalry is futile . Your hair , alas , is quite short and scanty . But this man has discovered in Africa a nut which turns a man into the husk of himself . No wonder that he came out of the sea all dry ! "
205019	205190	204631	204631	he	356	" Tush ! he is a pig . It is a pig that finds the nuts . I will be the butcher for that long pig , and the lady will rush into the arms of conquest . Then will I possess all the Admiral 's lands , and pursue the fine chase of the rabbits . And I will give dinners , such dinners , my faith ! Ha ! that is excellent said embrace me my Faith will sit at the right side of the table , and explain to the English company that such dinners could proceed from nobody except a French gentleman commingling all the knowledge of the joint with the loftier conception of the hash , the mince the what you call ? Ah , you have no name for it , because you do not know the proper thing . Then , in the presence of admiring Englishmen , I will lean back in my chair , the most comfortable chair that can be found "
205191	205203	205204	205204	Carne	356	" Stop . You have got to get into it yet , "
205209	205243	205204	205204	Carne	356	" and the way to do that is not to lean back in it . The fault of your system has always been that you want to enjoy everything before you get it . "
205244	205249	205251	205251	Charron	403	" And of yours , "
205263	205278	204631	204631	he	356	" that when you have got everything , you will enjoy what ? Nothing ! "
205279	205294	205296	205296	Carne	356	" Even a man of your levity hits the nail on the head sometimes , "
205298	205491	205296	205296	Carne	356	" though the blow can not be a very heavy one . Nature has not fashioned me for enjoyment , and therefore affords me very little . But some little I do expect in the great inversion coming , in the upset of the scoundrels who have fattened on my flesh , and stolen my land , to make country gentlemen if it were possible of themselves . It will take a large chimney to burn their title - deeds , for the robbery has lasted for a century . But I hold the great Emperor 's process signed for that ; and if you come to my cookery , you will say that I am capable of enjoyment . Fighting I enjoy not , as hot men do , nor guzzling , nor swigging , nor singing of songs ; for all of which you have a talent , my friend . But the triumph of quiet skill I like ; and I love to turn the balance on my enemies . Of these there are plenty , and among them all who live in that fishy little hole down there . "
205589	205598	205600	205600	Carne	356	" What a rare blaze they will make ! "
205621	205829	205600	205600	Carne	356	" Every cottage there shall be a bonfire , because it has cast off allegiance to me . The whole race of Darling will be at my mercy the pompous old Admiral , who refused to call on me till his idiot of a son persuaded him that wretched poetaster , who reduced me to the ignominy of reading his own rubbish to him and the haughty young woman that worships a savage who has treated me with insult . I have them all now in the hollow of my hand , and a thorough good crumpling is prepared for them . The first house to burn shall be Zebedee Tugwell 's , that conceited old dolt of a fishing fellow , who gives me a nod of suspicion , instead of pulling off his dirty hat to me . Then we blow up the church , and old Twemlow 's house , and the Admiral 's , when we have done with it . The fishing - fleet , as they call their wretched tubs , will come home , with the usual fuss , to - night , and on Monday it shall be ashes . How like you my programme ? Is it complete ? "
205830	205841	205843	205846	the kindly hearted Frenchman	5599	" Too much , too much complete ; too barbarous , "
205848	205978	205843	205846	the kindly hearted Frenchman	5599	" What harm have all the poor men done to you ? And what insanity to provoke enemies of the people all around who would bring us things to eat ! And worse if the houses are consumed with fire , where will be the revenue that is designed for me , as the fair son of the Admiral ? No , no ; I will allow none of that . When the landing is made , you will not be my master . Soult will have charge of the subjects inferior , and he is not a man of rapine . To him will I address myself in favour of the village . Thus shall I ascend in the favour of my charming , and secure my property . "
205979	206028	205600	205600	Carne	356	" Captain , I am your master yet , and I will have no interference . No more talk ; but obey me to the letter . There is no sign of any rough weather , I suppose ? You sailors see things which we do not observe . "
206029	206068	205600	205600	Carne	356	" This summer has not been of fine weather , and the sky is always changing here . But there is not any token of a tempest now . Though there is a little prospect of rain always . "
206069	206315	205843	205846	the kindly hearted Frenchman	5599	" If it rains , all the better , for it obscures the sea . You have fed enough now to last even you till the evening ; or if not , you can take some with you . Remain to the westward , where the cliffs are higher , and look out especially for British ships of war that may be appearing up Channel . Take this second spy - glass ; it is quite strong enough . But first of all tell Perkins to stand off again with the pilot - boat , as if he was looking out for a job , and if he sees even a frigate coming eastward , to run back and let you know by a signal arranged between you . Dan Tugwell , I see , was shipped yesterday on board of Prame No . 801 , a very handy vessel , which will lead the van , and five hundred will follow in her track on Sunday evening . My excellent uncle will be at the height of his eloquence just when his favourite Sunday - school boy is bringing an addition to his congregation . But the church shall not be blown up until Monday , for fear of premature excitement . By Monday night about two hundred thousand such soldiers as Britain could never produce will be able to quell any childish excitement such as Great Britain is apt to give way to . "
206316	206360	205600	205600	Carne	356	" But what is for me , this same Saturday night ? I like very much to make polite the people , and to marry the most beautiful and the richest ; but not to kill more than there is to be helped . "
206361	206401	205600	205600	Carne	356	" The breaking of the egg may cut the fingers that have been sucked till their skin is gone . You have plagued me all along with your English hankerings , which in your post of trust are traitorous . "
206497	206549	206494	206494	he	403	" Your position , my commander , does not excuse such words . You shall answer for them , when I am discharged from your command ; which , I hope , will be the case next week . To be spoken of as a traitor by you is very grand . "
206550	206557	206558	206558	Carne	356	" Take it as you please , "
206571	206702	206558	206558	Carne	356	" For the present , however , you will not be grand , but carry out the orders which I give you . As soon as it is dark , you will return , keep the pilot - boat in readiness for my last despatch , with which you will meet the frigate Torche about midnight , as arranged on Thursday . All that and the signals you already understand . Wait for me by this tree , and I may go with you ; but that will depend upon circumstances . I will take good care that you shall not be kept starving ; for you may have to wait here three or four hours for me . But be sure that you do not go until I come . "
206703	206727	206494	206494	he	403	" But what am I to do if I have seen some British ships , or Perkins has given me token of them ? "
206728	206779	206558	206558	Carne	356	" Observe their course , and learn where they are likely to be at nightfall . There will probably be none . All I fear is that they may intercept the Torche . Farewell , my friend , and let your sense of duty subdue the small sufferings of temper . "
206785	206792	206794	206795	Captain Tugwell	278	" This is how it is , "
206805	206869	206794	206795	Captain Tugwell	278	" the folk they goes on with a thing , till a man as has any head left twists it round on his neck , with his chin looking down his starn - post . Then the enemy cometh , with his spy - glass and his guns , and afore he can look round , he hath nothing left to look for . "
206870	206918	206558	206558	Carne	356	" Then you think , Tugwell , that the danger is not over ? that the French mean business even now , when every one is tired of hearing of it ? I have been away so long that I know nothing . But the universal opinion is "
206919	206927	206928	206929	Master Zebedee	649	" Opinion of the universe be dashed ! "
206938	207434	206928	206929	Master Zebedee	649	" We calls ourselves the universe , when we be the rope that drags astarn of it . Cappen , to my mind there is mischief in the wind , more than there hath been for these three years ; and that 's why you see me here , instead of going with the smacks . Holy Scripture saith a dream cometh from the Lord ; leastways , to a man of sense , as hardly ever dreameth . The wind was so bad again us , Monday afternoon , that we put off sailing till the Tuesday , and Monday night I lay on my own bed , without a thought of nothing but to sleep till five o'clock . I had n't taken nothing but a quart of John Prater 's ale and you know what his measures is not a single sip of grog ; but the Hangel of the Lord he come and stand by me in the middle of the night . And he took me by the hand , or if he did n't it come to the same thing of my getting there , and he set me up in a dark high place , the like of the yew - tree near Carne Castle . And then he saith , ' Look back , Zeb ' ; and I looked , and behold Springhaven was all afire , like the bottomless pit , or the thunder - storm of Egypt , or the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . And two figures was jumping about in the flames , like the furnace in the plain of Dura , and one of them was young Squire Carne , and the other was my son Daniel , as behaveth below his name . And I called out , ' Daniel , thou son of Zebedee and Kezia Tugwell , come forth from the burning fiery furnace ' ; but he answered not , neither heeded me . And then Squire Darling , Sir Charles is now the name of him , out he come from his Round - house , and by the white gate above high - water mark , to order out the fire , because they was all his own cottages . But while he was going about , as he doth for fear of being hard upon any one , out jumps Squire Carne , from the thickest of the blazes , and takes the poor Squire by the forepart of his neck , which he liketh to keep open when he getteth off of duty , and away with him into the burning fiery furnace made of his own houses ! That was more than I could put up with , even under the Hangel , and I give such a kick that Kezia , though she saith she is the most quietest of women , felt herself a forced to bounce me up . "
207435	207444	207446	207446	Erle	473	" A dream of that sort deserves notice , "
207456	207715	207446	207446	Erle	473	" and over and above that , I see proofs of a foolish security in England , and of sharp activity in France . Last Monday I was only five miles from Boulogne , on board of our frigate the Melpomene , for I wanted the captain 's evidence to help me in my own affairs ; and upon my word I was quite amazed at the massing of the French forces there , and the evident readiness of their hundreds of troop - ships . Scores of them even had horses on board , for I saw them quite clearly with a spy - glass . But the officers only laughed at me , and said they were tired of seeing that . And another thing I do n't like at all is the landing of a French boat this side of Pebbleridge . I was coming home after dark one night , and as soon as they saw me they pushed off , and pretended to be English fishermen ; but if ever I saw Frenchmen , these were French ; and I believe they had a ship not far away , for I saw a light shown and then turned off . I examined the place in the morning , and saw the footprints of men on a path up the cliff , as if they had gone inland towards Carne Castle . When the Admiral came home , I told him of it ; but he seemed to think it was only some smuggling . "
207716	207805	207815	207815	Twemlow	473	" Ah , there 's smooglin ' of a bad kind over there , to my belief . I would n't tell your honour not a quarter what I thinks , because of the young gentleman being near akin to you . But a thing or two have come to my ears , very much again a young squire over that way . A man as will do what he have done is a black one in some ways ; and if some , why not in all ? "
207806	207813	207815	207815	Twemlow	473	" Tell me what you mean , "
207819	207859	207815	207815	Twemlow	473	" After saying so much , you are bound to say more . Caryl Carne is no friend of mine , although he is my cousin . I dislike the man , though I know but little of him . "
207860	207916	207815	207815	Twemlow	473	" For sartin then a kind gentleman like you wo n't like him none the better for betraying of a nice young maid as put her trust in him , as lively and pretty a young maid as ever stepped , and might have had the pick of all the young men in the parish . "
207917	207920	207922	207922	Erle	473	" What ! "
207943	207951	207938	207938	her	297	" Tugwell , do you mean to say "
207952	208300	207815	207815	Twemlow	473	" Yes , sir ; only you must keep it to yourself , for the sake of the poor young thing ; though too many knows it already , I 'm afeared . And that was how poor Jem Cheeseman changed from a dapper money - turning man , as pleasant as could be , to a down - hearted , stick - in - doors , honest - weighted fellow . Poor little Polly was as simple as a dove , and her meant to break none of the Lord 's commandments , unless it was a sin to look so much above her . He took her aboard her father 's trading - craft , and made pretence to marry her across the water , her knowing nothing of the lingo , to be sure ; and then when there come a thumping boy , and her demanded for the sake of the young ' un that her marriage should be sartified in the face of all the world , what does he do but turn round and ask her if she was fool enough to suppose that a Carne had married a butter - man 's daughter ? With a few words more , she went off of her head , and have never been right again , they say ; and her father , who was mighty proud to have a grandson heir to an old ancient castle , he was so took aback with this disappointment that he puzzled all the village , including of me , as I am free to own , by jumping into his own rope . ' Twas only now just that I heard all this ; and as the captain of this here place , I shall ask leave of Cheeseman to have it out with Master Carne , as soon as may be done without hurting the poor thing . If she had been my child , the rope should have gone round his neck first , if it come to mine there - arter ! "
208301	208306	208307	208307	Twemlow	473	" The - villain ! "
208329	208409	208307	208307	Twemlow	473	" And to think that all this time he has been daring to address himself But never mind that now . It will be a bad time for him when I catch him by himself , though I must not speak of Polly . Poor little Polly ! what a pretty child she was ! I used to carry sugar - plums on purpose for her . Good - bye , Tugwell ; I must think about all this . "
208410	208426	208431	208431	himself	278	" And so must I , sir . What a strapping chap ' a be ! "
208472	208585	208586	208586	Twemlow	473	" Never did see such a hairy chap . Never showed no signs of it when ' a was a lad , and Miss ' Liza quite smooth in the front of her neck . Must come of Hottentot climate , I reckon . They calls it the bush , from the folk been so bushy . I used to think as my beard was a pretty good example ; but , Lord bless me and keep me , it would all go on his nose ! If ' a spreadeth that over the face of Squire Carne , ' a will ravish him , as the wicked doth ravish the poor . "
209772	209787	209788	209790	the old man	1354	" Kneel here , my son , and move not until I tell you , "
209859	209885	209887	209888	Councillor Tuloo	652	" In one moon you will be a beast of the woods , and in two you shall return to the Queen that loves you , "
210024	210093	210018	210018	He	652	" I know what women are . As long as she never had thought about men , you might crawl , and be only a hog to her . But her eyes have been opened to this white man , and there is room for a black one to go into them . And unless you are at hand , it will be done by some one else . "
211242	211252	211253	211253	he	654	" That girl has some burden upon her mind , "
211287	211290	211274	211274	she	277	" For the "
211296	212272	212273	212273	Our	5743	" as the young sparks entitled her , was ill at ease with herself , and ready to quarrel with every one except herself . She had conscience enough to confess , whenever she could not get away from it , that for weeks and months she had been slipping far and further from the true and honest course . Sometimes , with a pain like a stitch in the side , the truth would spring upon her ; and perhaps for a moment she would wonder at herself , and hate the man misleading her . But this happened chiefly when he was present , and said or did something to vex her ; and then he soon set it to rights again , and made everything feel delightful . And this way of having her misgivings eased made them easier when they came again with no one to appease them . For she began to think of what he had done , and how kind and considerate his mind must be , and how hard it must seem to mistrust him . Another thing that urged her to keep on now , without making any fuss about it , was the wonderful style her sister Faith had shown since that hairy monster came back again . It was manifest that the world contained only one man of any high qualities , and nobody must dare to think even twice about any conclusion he laid down . He had said to her , with a penetrating glance and it must have been that to get through such a thicket that dangerous people were about , and no girl possessing any self - respect must think of wandering on the shore alone . The more she was spied upon and admonished , the more she would do what she thought right ; and a man who had lived among savages for years must be a queer judge of propriety . But , in spite of all these defiant thoughts , her heart was very low , and her mind in a sad flutter , and she could not even smile as she met her father 's gaze . Supposing that she was frightened at the number of the guests , and the noise of many tongues , and the grandeur of the people , the gentle old man made a little signal to her to come and have a whisper with him , as a child might do , under courtesy of the good company . But Dolly feigned not to understand , at the penalty of many a heart - pang . The dinner went on with a very merry sound , and a genuine strength of enjoyment , such as hearty folk have who know one another , and are met together not to cut capers of wit , but refresh their goodwill and fine principles . And if any dinner party can be so arranged that only five per cent . has any trouble on its mind , the gentleman who whips away the plates , at a guinea a mouth , will have to go home with a face of willow pattern . The other whose mind was away from her food , and reckless of its own nourishment , was Blyth Scudamore 's mother , as gentle a lady as ever tried never to think of herself . In spite of all goodness , and faith in the like , she had enough to make her very miserable now , whenever she allowed herself to think about it , and that was fifty - nine minutes out of sixty . For a brief account of her son 's escape from Etaples had reached her , through the kindness of Captain Desportes , who found means to get a letter delivered to the Admiral . That brave French officer spoke most highly of the honourable conduct of his English friend , but had very small hope of his safety . For he added the result of his own inquiries to the statement of M. Jalais , and from these it was clear that poor Scuddy had set forth alone in a rickety boat , ill found and ill fitted to meet even moderate weather in the open Channel . Another young Englishman had done the like , after lurking in the forest of Hardelot , but he had been recaptured by the French at the outset of his hopeless voyage . Scudamore had not been so retaken ; and the Captain who had not received his letter until it was too late to interfere , by reason of his own despatch to Dieppe had encountered a sharp summer gale just then , which must have proved fatal to the poor old boat . The only chance was that some English ship might have picked up the wanderer , and if so the highly respected Admiral would have heard of it before he received this letter . As no such tidings had been received , there could be little doubt about the issue in any reasonable mind . But the heart of a woman is not a mind , or the man that is born of her might as well forego the honour . However , as forty people were quite happy , the wisest course is to rejoin them . The ladies were resolved upon this occasion to storm the laws of usage which required their withdrawal before the toasts began ; and so many gentle voices challenged the garrison of men behind their bottles that terms of unusual scope were arranged . It was known that the Marquis would make a fine speech short , and therefore all the finer in proposing the toast of the evening , to wit , "
212280	212488	212273	212273	Our	5743	" Under the vigorous lead of Mrs. Stubbard , the ladies demanded to hear every word ; after which they would go , and discuss their own affairs , or possibly those of their neighbours . But the gentlemen must endure their presence till his lordship had spoken , and the Admiral replied . Faith was against this arrangement , because she foresaw that it would make them very late ; but she yielded to the wishes of so many of her guests , consoled with the thought that she would be supported by some one on her left hand , who would be her support for life . When all had done well , except the two aforesaid , and good - will born of good deeds was crowning comfort with jocund pleasure , and the long oak table , rich of grain and dark with the friction of a hundred years , shone in the wavering flow of dusk with the gleam of purple and golden fruit , the glance of brilliant glass that puzzles the light with its claim to shadow , and the glow of amber and amethyst wine decanted to settle that question then the bold Admiral , standing up , said , "
212501	212502	212273	212273	Our	5743	" "
212511	212585	212273	212273	Our	5743	" said the guest , who was shrewd at an answer . And Dolly , being quick at occasion , seized it , and in the shifting of chairs left her own for some one else . The curtains were drawn across the western window , to close the conflict between God 's light and man 's , and then this well - known gentleman , having placed his bottle handily for he never "
212592	212645	212646	212647	My friends	10648	" to use his own expression arose with his solid frame as tranquil as a rock , and his full - fronted head like a piece of it . Every gentleman bowed to his bow , and waited with silent respect for his words , because they would be true and simple . "
212799	212928	212776	212777	one man	687	" But we of England have refused to be stripped of all that we hold dear , at the will of a foreign upstart . We have fought for years , and we still are fighting , without any brag or dream of glory , for the rights of ourselves and of all mankind . There have been among us weak - minded fellows , babblers of abstract nonsense , and even , I grieve to say traitors . But , on the whole , we have stood together , and therefore have not been trodden on . How it may end is within the knowledge of the Almighty only ; but already there are signs that we shall be helped , if we continue to help ourselves . "
213059	213105	213106	213106	Our	5768	" The Marquis of Southdown filled his glass from a bottle of grand old Chambertin six of which had been laid most softly in a cupboard of the wainscote for his use and then he had it filled again , and saw his meaning brilliantly . "
213296	213403	213404	213405	The Marquis	9021	" Well , my friends , we have done our best , and have some right to be proud of it ; but we should depart from our nature if we even exercised that right . The nature of an Englishman is this to be afraid of nothing but his own renown . Feeling this great truth , I will avoid offence by hiding as a crime my admiration of the glorious soldiers and sailors here , yet beg them for once to remember themselves , as having enabled me to propose , and all present to pledge , the welfare of our King and Country . "
213528	213541	213522	213522	his	8990	" Silence , silence , till we all sing the National Anthem ! "
213710	213716	213717	213717	he	747	" Strike up , Admiral , "
214091	214099	214100	214100	he	1020	" Death for at least three men , "
214103	214135	214100	214100	he	1020	" if they are fools enough to meddle with me . My faith , these Darlings are grown very grand , on the strength of the land that belongs to us ! "
214564	214578	214579	214579	he	1020	" What a time you have been ! I was giving it up , "
214586	214656	214579	214579	he	1020	" Where are the candles ? I must strike a light . Surely you might have brought one . Bolt the door , while I make a light , and close the curtains quietly , but leave the window open . Do n't shake , like a child that is going to be whipped . Too late now for nonsense . What are you afraid of ? Silly child ! "
214733	214742	214747	214747	he	357	" Come and let me look at you , "
214769	214819	214747	214747	he	357	" Beauty , how pale you look , and yet how perfectly lovely in this evening gown ! I should like to kill the two gentlemen who sat next to you at dinner . Darling , you know that whatever I do is only for your own sweet sake . "
214820	214834	214836	214837	the lady	1524	" If you please not to touch me , it will be better , "
214857	214870	214836	214837	the lady	1524	" you are come upon business , and you should do it . "
214939	214952	214953	214953	he	357	" A despatch from London arrived today ; I must see it , "
214958	215019	214953	214953	he	357	" as well as the copy of the answer sent . And then my beauty must insert a NOT in the order to be issued in the morning , or otherwise invert its meaning , simply to save useless bloodshed . The key for a moment , the key , my darling , of this fine old piece of furniture ! "
215020	215056	215129	215129	Her	5816	" Is it likely that I would give you the key ? My father always keeps it . What right have you with his private desk ? I never promised anything so bad as that . "
215057	215066	215067	215067	he	357	" I am not to be trifled with , "
215072	215102	215067	215067	he	357	" Do you think that I came here for kissing ? The key I must have , or break it open ; and how will you explain that away ? "
215147	215156	215157	215157	she	5816	" There is a key that opens it , "

215680	215706	215672	215672	he	357	" there must have been some , if this desk is the one . Have you dared to delude me by showing the wrong desk ? "

215788	215862	215778	215778	she	277	" you have ransacked my father 's private desk , which I allowed you to do , because my father has no secrets . He leaves it open half the time , because he is a man of honour . He is not a man of plots , and wiles , and trickery upon women . And you have deluded yourself , in dreaming that a daughter of his would betray her Country . "

216355	216364	216328	216328	He	356	" Will you force me to kill you ? "

216849	216890	216846	216847	the Marquis	9021	" We 'll stop here ; you know the house ; take the shortest cut to the window . Whoever is there , we shall have him so . I am too slow . Boy Bob , go with him . "

217116	217221	217228	217228	Twemlow	473	" Twemlow , how glad I am that I have met you ! You are the very man I wanted . There has been a sad accident in there with one of the Admiral 's pistols , and the dear old man is badly wounded . I am off for a doctor , for my horse is at hand . For God 's sake run in , and hold his head up , and try to staunch the bleeding . I shall be back in half an hour with the man that lives at Pebbleridge . Do n't lose a moment . Particulars hereafter . "

217274	217309	217310	217310	Carne	356	" You shall answer for this , when time allows . If the door was bolted , he must have done it . Let me pass ; the last chance depends on my speed . "

218194	218241	218101	218102	Lord Southdown	654	" But , my poor dear , you must think of others . Your dear father is beyond all help . Your gallant lover lies on the grass . They hope to bring him round , God willing ! Go where you can be of use . "
218242	218292	218293	218294	The Marquis	9021	" How cruel you are ! You must want to drive me mad . Let his father and mother see to him , while I see to my own father . If you had a daughter , you would understand . Am I crying ? Do I even tremble ? "
218624	218727	218729	218729	she	5907	" Do n't speak . Do n't look at him . You have no right here . When he comes to himself , he will want none but me . I have always done everything for him since dear mother died ; and I shall get him to sit up . He will be so much better when he sits up . I can get him to do it , if you will only go . Oh , father , father , it is your own Faith come to make you well , dear , if you will only look at me ! "

You can pull down a score of Volunteers apiece , if they dare to come after me . I have an hour to spare , and I know how to employ it . Jerry , old Jerry Bowles , stir your crooked shanks .

223018	223127	222953	222955	the old man	1354	" It was a slight error of judgment , Jerry . What a mealy lot these English are , to make such a fuss about a trifle ! But I am too soft - hearted to blow her up . Tell her to meet me in half an hour by the broken dial , and to bring the brat , and all her affairs in a bundle such as she can carry , or kick down the hill before her . In half an hour , do you understand ? And if you care for your stiff old bones , get out of the way by that time . "

223957	224001	223876	223878	the young mother	6082	" There is no time for this nonsense , Polly . He is a wonderful baby , I dare say ; and so is every baby , till he gets too old . You must obey orders , and be off with him . "
224002	224170	223876	223878	the young mother	6082	" Oh no ! You are come to take us with you . There , I have covered his face up , that he may not suppose you look cross at me . Oh , Caryl , you would never leave him behind , even if you could do that to me . We are not grand people , and you can put us anywhere , and now I am nearly as well as ever . I have put up all his little things ; it does not matter about my own . I was never brought up to be idle , and I can earn my own living anywhere ; and it might be a real comfort for you , with the great people going against you , to have somebody , not very grand , of course , but as true to you as yourself , and belonging altogether to you . I know many people who would give their eyes for such a baby . "

224185	224212	223876	223878	the young mother	6082	" my arrangements are made , and I can not take you . I have no fault to find with you , but argument is useless . "
224213	224508	223876	223878	the young mother	6082	" Yes , I know that , Caryl ; and I am sure that I never would attempt to argue with you . You should have everything your own way , and I could attend to so many things that no man ever does properly . I will be a slave to you , and this little darling love you , and then you will feel that you have two to love you , wherever you go , and whatever you do . And if I spoke crossly when first I found out that that I went away for nothing with you , you must have forgiven me by this time , and I never will remind you again of it ; if I do , send me back to the place I belong to . I belong to you now , Caryl , and so does he ; and when we are away from the people who know me , I shall be pleasant and cheerful again . I was only two - and - twenty the day the boats came home last week , and they used to say the young men jumped into the water as soon as they caught sight of me . Try to be kind to me , and I shall be so happy that I shall look almost as I used to do , when you said that the great ladies might be grander , but none of them fit to look into my looking - glass . Dear Caryl , I am ready ; I do n't care where it is , or what I may have to put up with , so long as you will make room for your Polly , and your baby . "

224533	224604	224521	224521	Carne	356	" but once for all , no more of this . I have quite forgiven any strong expressions you may have made use of when your head was light ; and if all goes well , I shall provide for you and the child , according to your rank in life . But now you must run down the hill , if you wish to save your life and his . "
224605	224726	223876	223878	the young mother	6082	" I have run down the hill already . I care not a pin for my own life ; and hard as you are you would never have the heart to destroy your own little Caryl . He may be called Caryl you will not deny him that , although he has no right to be called Carne . Oh , Caryl , Caryl , you can be so good , when you think there is something to gain by it . Only be good to us now , and God will bless you for it , darling . I have given up all the world for you , and you can not have the heart to cast me off . "

224780	224845	223876	223878	the young mother	6082	" Through my own folly ! Oh , God in heaven , that you should speak so of my love for you ! Squire Carne , you are the worst man that ever lived ; and it serves me right for trusting you . But where am I to go ? Who will take me and support me , and my poor abandoned child ? "
224846	224892	224893	224893	She	6085	" Your parents , of course , are your natural supporters . You are hurting your child by this low abuse of me . Now put aside excitement , and run home , like a sensible woman , before your good father goes to bed . "

226213	226253	226172	226172	he	357	" Come down , for God 's sake , and climb that cursed wood , and pull back the fuse , pull it back from the powder . Oh , Polly ! and then we will go away together . "
226254	226326	226327	226327	Carne	357	" It is too late . I will not risk my baby . You have made me so weak that I could never climb that fence . You are blowing up the castle which you promised to my baby ; but you shall not blow up him . You told me to run away , and run I must . Good - bye ; I am going to my natural supporters . "

226808	226897	226797	226798	the Frenchman	1854	" Something has gone wrong behind the tail of everything . And there goes that big Stoobar , blazing with his sordid battery ! Arouse thee , old Cheray ! The time too late is over . Those lights thrice accursed will display our little boat , and John Bull is rushing with a thousand sails . The Commander is mad . They will have him , and us too . Shall I dance by a rope ? It is the only dancing probable for me in England . "
226898	226908	226909	226911	the old man	1354	" I have never expected any good to come , "
226917	226988	226909	226911	the old man	1354	" The curse of the house is upon the young Squire . I saw it in his eyes this morning , the same as I saw in his father 's eyes , when the sun was going down the very night he died . I shall never see him more , sir , nor you either , nor any other man that bides to the right side of his coffin . "
226989	227022	226797	226798	the Frenchman	1854	" Bah ! what a set you are of funerals , you Englishmen ! But if I thought he was in risk , I would stay to see the end of it . "

227235	227395	227222	227233	Charron , who had fallen , or been felled by the concussion	6129	" Cheray , art thou still alive ? The smoke is in my neck . I can not liberate my words , but the lumps must be all come down by this time , without adding to the weight of our poor brains . Something fell in this old tree , a long way up , as high as where the crows build . It was like a long body , with one leg and one arm . I hope it was not the Commander ; but one thing is certain he is gone to heaven . Let us pray that he may stop there , if St. Peter admits a man who was selling the keys of his country to the enemy . But we must do duty to ourselves , my Cheray . Let us hasten to the sea , and give the signal for the boat . La Torche will be a weak light after this . "

227466	227501	227429	227429	his	1354	" I hear the tramp of soldiers in the valley . If they catch you here , it will be drum - head work , and you will swing before morning in the ruins . "
227502	227530	227429	227429	his	1354	" I am very old . My time is short . I would liefer hang from an English beam than deal any more with your outlandish lot . "
227531	227566	227429	227429	his	1354	" Farewell to thee , then ! Thou art a faithful clod . Here are five guineas for thee , of English stamp . I doubt if napoleons shall ever be coined in England . "
227628	227632	227638	227645	a gaunt , ragged figure that approached him	6140	" I am starving "
227647	227717	227638	227645	a gaunt , ragged figure that approached him	6140	" For three days my food has been forgotten ; and bad as it was , I missed it . There came a great rumble , and my walls fell down . Ancient Jerry , I can go no further . I am empty as a shank bone when the marrow - toast is serving . Your duty was to feed me , with inferior stuff at any rate . "
227718	227725	227638	227645	a gaunt , ragged figure that approached him	6140	" No , sir , no ; "
227738	227772	227638	227645	a gaunt , ragged figure that approached him	6140	" Sir Parsley , it was no fault of mine whatever . Squire undertook to see to all of it himself . Do n't blame me , sir ; do n't blame me . "
227773	227784	227638	227645	a gaunt , ragged figure that approached him	6140	" Never mind the blame , but make it good , "
227803	227828	227638	227645	a gaunt , ragged figure that approached him	6140	" What do I see there ? It is like a crust of bread , but I am too weak to stoop for it . "
227829	227837	227838	227840	The old man	1354	" Come inside the tree , sir . "
227852	228005	227838	227840	The old man	1354	" What a shame to starve you , and you so hearty ! But the Squire clean forgotten it , I doubt , with his foreign tricks coming to this great blow - up . Here , sir , here ; please to sit down a moment , while I light a candle . They French chaps are so wasteful always , and always grumbling at good English victual . Here 's enough to feed a family Captain Charron has throwed by bread , and good mutton , and pretty near half a ham , and a bottle or so of thin nasty foreign wine . Eat away , Sir Parsley ; why , it does me good to see you . You feeds something like an Englishman . But you know , sir , it were all your own fault at bottom , for coming among them foreigners a - meddling . "
228006	228020	228021	228022	Percival Shargeloes	580	" You are a fine fellow . You shall be my head butler , "
228447	228454	228455	228456	the Emperor	9832	" Send Admiral Decres to me , "
228564	228574	228575	228575	He	1634	" What then is the meaning of all this ? "
228588	228702	228575	228575	He	1634	" You have lost me three days of it . How much longer will you conceal your knowledge ? Carne 's scheme has failed , through treachery probably his own . I never liked the man . He wanted to be the master of me of me ! I can do without him ; it is all the better , if my fleet will come . I have three fleets , besides these . Any one of them would do . They would do , if even half their crews were dead , so long as they disturbed the enemy . You know where Villeneuve is , but you will not tell me . "
228703	228712	228542	228542	he	1634	" I told your Majesty what I thought , "
228720	228742	228713	228714	M. Decres	670	" but it did not please you to listen to me . Shall I now tell your Majesty what I know ? "
228743	228783	228575	228575	He	1634	" Ha ! You have dared to have secret despatches ! You know more of the movements of my fleets than I do ! You have been screening him all along . Which of you is the worse traitor ? "
228784	228924	228713	228714	M. Decres	670	" Your Majesty will regret these words . Villeneuve and myself are devoted to you . I have not heard from him . I have received no despatches . But in a private letter just received , which is here at your Majesty 's service , I find these words , which your Majesty can see . ' From my brother on the Spanish coast I have just heard . Admiral Villeneuve has sailed for Cadiz , believing Nelson to be in chase of him . My brother saw the whole fleet crowding sail southward . No doubt it is the best thing they could do . If they came across Nelson , they would be knocked to pieces . ' Your Majesty , that is an opinion only ; but it seems to be shared by M. Villeneuve . "
229129	229134	229141	229141	himself	9832	" It is good , "
229153	229198	229141	229141	himself	9832	" you will understand , Decres , that I am not angry , but only lament that I have such a set of fools . You are not the worst . I have bigger fools than you . Alas that I should confess it ! "
229253	229265	229267	229267	Napoleon	385	" Villeneuve can not help it that he is a fool , "
229274	229425	229267	229267	Napoleon	385	" but he owes it to his rank that he should not be a coward . Nelson is his black beast . Nelson has reduced him to a condition of wet pulp . I shall send a braver man to supersede him . Are French fleets forever to turn tail to an inferior force of stupid English ? If I were on the seas , I would sweep Nelson from them . Our men are far braver , when they learn to spread their legs . As soon as I have finished with those filthy Germans , I will take the command of the fleets myself . It will be a bad day for that bragging Nelson . Give me pen and paper , and send Daru to me . I must conquer the Continent once more , I suppose ; and then I will return and deal with England . "
229793	229807	229809	229809	Nelson	276	" My dear , you must check it ; you must leave off , "
229818	229865	229809	229809	Nelson	276	" It is useless for me to say a word to you , because I am almost as bad myself . But still I am older , and I feel that I ought to be able to comfort you , if I only knew the way . "
229866	229983	229997	229997	her	6191	" You do comfort me , more than I can tell , although you do n't say anything . For any one to sit here , and be sorry with me , makes it come a little lighter . And when it is a man like you , Lord Nelson , I feel a sort of love that makes me feel less bitter . Mr. Twemlow drove me wild with a quantity of texts , and a great amount of talk about a better land . How would he like to go to it himself , I wonder ? There is a great hole in my heart , and nothing that anybody says can fill it . "
229984	229996	229997	230000	her father 's friend	6193	" And nothing that any one can do , my dear , "
230005	230060	229997	230000	her father 's friend	6193	" unless it is your own good self , with the kindness of the Lord to help you . One of the best things to begin with is to help somebody else , if you can , and lead yourself away into another person 's troubles . Is there any one here very miserable ? "
230061	230185	229997	230000	her father 's friend	6193	" None that I can think of half so miserable as I am . There is great excitement , but no misery . Miss Twemlow has recovered her Lord Mayor the gentleman that wore that extraordinary coat oh , I forgot , you were not here then . And although he has had a very sad time of it , every one says that the total want of diet will be much better for him than any mere change . I am ashamed to be talking of such trifles now ; but I respect that man , he was so straightforward . If my brother Frank had been at all like him , we should never have been as we are this day . "
230186	230311	229997	229997	her	6191	" My dear , you must not blame poor Frank . He would not come down to the dinner because he hated warlike speeches . But he has seen the error of his ways . No more treasonable stuff for him . He thought it was large , and poetic , and all that , like giving one 's shirt to an impostor . All of us make mistakes sometimes . I have made a great many myself , and have always been the foremost to perceive them . But your own brave lover have you forgotten him ? He fought like a hero , I am told ; and nothing could save his life except that he wore a new - fashioned periwig . "
230312	230473	229997	230000	her father 's friend	6193	" I would rather not talk of him now , Lord Nelson , although he had no periwig . I am deeply thankful that he escaped ; and no doubt did his best , as he was bound to do . I try to be fair to everybody , but I can not help blaming every one , when I come to remember how blind we have been . Captain Stubbard must have been so blind , and Mrs. Stubbard a great deal worse , and worst of all his own aunt , Mrs. Twemlow . Oh , Lord Nelson , if you had only stopped here , instead of hurrying away for more glory ! You saw the whole of it ; you predicted everything ; you even warned us again in your last letter ! And yet you must go away , and leave us to ourselves ; and this is how the whole of it has ended . "
230474	230656	229997	229997	her	6191	" My dear child , I will not deny that the eye of Nelson has a special gift for piercing the wiles of the scoundrelly foe . But I was under orders , and must go . The nation believed that it could not do without me , although there are other men every bit as good , and in their own opinion superior . But the enemy has never been of that opinion ; and a great deal depends upon what they think . And the rule has been always to send me where there are many kicks but few coppers . I have never been known to repine . We all err ; but if we do our duty as your dear father did his , the Lord will forgive us , when our enemies escape . When my time comes , as it must do soon , there will be plenty to carp at me ; but I shall not care , if I have done my best . Your father did his best , and is happy . "
230677	230688	230689	230689	she	297	" Give me one of the buttons of your coat , "
230692	230705	230689	230689	she	297	" here is one that can not last till you get home . "
230796	230806	230807	230807	he	6194	" I should like to do more than that , "
230820	230839	230807	230807	he	6194	" Is there nobody here that I can help , from my long good - will to Springhaven ? "
230840	230850	230852	230852	Faith	297	" Oh , yes ! How stupid I am ! "
230854	230992	230807	230807	he	6194	" I forget everybody in my own trouble . There is a poor young man with a broken heart , who came to me this morning . He has done no harm that I know of , but he fell into the power of that wicked but I will use no harsh words , because he is gone most dreadfully to his last account . This poor youth said that he only cared to die , after all the things that had happened here , for he has always been fond of my father . At first I refused to see him , but they told me such things that I could not help it . He is the son of our chief man here , and you said what a fine British seaman he would make . "
230993	231008	231009	231009	Nelson	276	" I remember two or three of that description , especially young Dan Tugwell . "
231030	231080	230807	230807	he	6194	" I see by your eyes that it is young Tugwell . If it will be any pleasure to you , I will see him , and do what I can for him . What has he done , my dear , and what can I do for him ? "
231081	231224	230807	230807	he	6194	" He has fallen into black disgrace , and his only desire is to redeem it by dying for his country . His own father has refused to see him , although he was mainly the cause of it ; and his mother , who was Erle Twemlow 's nurse , is almost out of her mind with grief . A braver young man never lived , and he was once the pride of Springhaven . He saved poor Dolly from drowning , when she was very young , and the boat upset . His father chastised him cruelly for falling under bad influence . Then he ran away from the village , and seems to have been in French employment . But he was kept in the dark , and had no idea that he was acting against his own country . "
231225	231232	231234	231235	Lord Nelson	276	" He has been a traitor , "
231239	231253	231234	231235	Lord Nelson	276	" I can not help such a man , even for your sake . "
231254	231265	231267	231267	Faith	297	" He has not been a traitor , but betrayed , "
231269	231831	231267	231267	Faith	297	" he believed that his only employment was to convey private letters for the poor French prisoners , of whom we have so many hundreds . I will not contend that he was right in that ; but still it was no very great offence . Even you must have often longed to send letters to those you loved in England ; and you know how hard it is in war time . But what they really wanted him for was to serve as their pilot upon this coast . And the moment he discovered that , though they offered him bags of gold to do it , he faced his death like an Englishman . They attempted to keep him in a stupid state with drugs , so that he might work like a mere machine . But he found out that , and would eat nothing but hard biscuit . They had him in one of their shallow boats , or prames , as they call them , which was to lead them in upon signal from the arch - traitor . This was on Saturday , Saturday night that dreadful time when we were all so gay . They held a pair of pistols at poor Dan 's head , or at least a man was holding one to each of his ears , and they corded his arms , because he ventured to remonstrate . That was before they had even started , so you may suppose what they would have done to us . Poor Daniel made up his mind to die , and it would have eased his mind , he says now , if he had done so . But while they were waiting for the signal , which through dear father 's vigilance they never did receive , Dan managed to free both his hands in the dark , and as soon as he saw the men getting sleepy , he knocked them both down , and jumped overboard ; for he can swim like a fish , or even better . He had very little hopes of escaping , as he says , and the French fired fifty shots after him . With great presence of mind , he gave a dreadful scream , as if he was shot through the head at least , then he flung up his legs , as if he was gone down ; but he swam under water for perhaps a hundred yards , and luckily the moon went behind a black cloud . Then he came to a boat , which had broken adrift , and although he did not dare to climb into her , he held on by her , on the further side from them . She was drifting away with the tide , and at last he ventured to get on board of her , and found a pair of oars , and was picked up at daylight by a smuggling boat running for Newhaven . He was landed last night , and he heard the dreadful news , and having plenty of money , he hired a post - chaise , and never stopped until he reached Springhaven . He looks worn out now ; but if his mind was easier , he would soon be as strong as ever . "
231832	231842	231844	231844	Nelson	276	" It is a strange story , my dear , "
231846	231881	231844	231844	Nelson	276	" but I see that it has done you good to tell it , and I have known many still stranger . But how could he have money , after such a hard escape ? "
231882	231977	231844	231844	Nelson	276	" That shows as much as anything how brave he is . He had made up his mind that if he succeeded in knocking down both those sentinels , he would have the bag of gold which was put for his reward in case of his steering them successfully . And before he jumped overboard he snatched it up , and it helped him to dive and to swim under water . He put it in his flannel shirt by way of ballast , and he sticks to it up to the present moment . "
231978	231982	231984	231985	Lord Nelson	276	" My dear , "
232035	232035	232032	232033	Captain Hardy	673	"
232094	232103	232120	232126	The French commander - in - chief	6202	" A fair fight , and no favour , "
232199	232210	232212	232214	the British tar	6204	" What a lot for we to take to Spithead ! "
232508	232516	232517	232517	he	276	" Half of them will get away , "
232535	232662	232517	232517	he	276	" because of that rascally port to leeward . If the wind had held as it was last night , we should have had every one of them . It does seem hard , after waiting so long . And the sky looks like a gale of wind . It will blow to - night , though I shall not hear it . A gale of wind with disabled ships means terrible destruction . Do all you can to save those poor fellows . When they are beaten , we must consider their lives even more than our own , you know , because we have been the cause of it . You know my wishes as well as I do . Remember this one especially . "
232663	232677	232678	232679	Captain Blackwood	675	" Good - bye , my lord , till the fight is over . "
232698	232717	232678	232679	Captain Blackwood	675	" When we have got them , I shall come back , and find you safe and glorious . "
232718	232725	232726	232727	Lord Nelson	276	" God bless you , Blackwood ! "
232738	232748	232726	232727	Lord Nelson	276	" But you will never see me alive again . "
232992	233004	232988	232988	His	276	" Reserve your fire until you are sure of every shot . "
233182	233198	233155	233156	Lord Nelson	276	" For the honour of Springhaven , Dan , behave well in your first action . "
233475	233481	233468	233468	him	282	" Well done , Dan . "
233587	233591	233593	233593	Dan	282	" Thank God , "
233595	233627	233593	233593	Dan	282	" if those fellows in the tops , who are picking us off so , shoot at either of them , they will be sure to hit the big man first . "
233734	233746	233748	233749	the Captain	1173	" I hope you are not much hurt , my lord ? "
233757	233766	233767	233768	the hero	4661	" They have done for me at last , "
233771	233780	233767	233768	the hero	4661	" Hardy , my backbone is shot through . "
233883	233891	233893	233893	Dan	282	" I know who fired that shot , "
233905	233927	233928	233928	He	282	" He never shall live to boast of it , if I have to board the French ship to fetch him . "

234465	234476	234478	234478	Dan	282	" All of you fire , quick one after other , "
234498	234531	234478	234478	Dan	282	" fire so that he may tell the shots ; that will fetch him out again . Sing out first , ' There he is ! ' as if you saw him . "

236503	236518	236492	236493	the Captain	1173	" How are you , my dear sir ? and how is the system ? "
236519	236712	236460	236461	the other	893	" The system will never recover from the tricks that infernal Carne has played with it . But never mind that , if the intellect survives ; we all owe a debt to our country . I have met you in the very nick of time . Yesterday was Guy Fawkes ' Day , and I wanted to be married then ; but the people were not ready . I intend to have it now on New - Year 's Day , because then I shall always remember the date . I am going up here to make a strange request , and I want you to say that it is right and proper . An opinion from a distinguished sailor will go a long way with the daughters of an Admiral . I want the young ladies to be my bridesmaids and then for the little ones , your Maggy and your Kitty . I am bound to go to London for a month to - morrow , and then I could order all the bracelets and the brooches , if I were only certain who the blessed four would be . "
236713	236742	236492	236493	the Captain	1173	" I never had any bridesmaids myself , and I do n't know anything about them . I thought that the ladies were the people to settle that . "

236780	236808	236492	236493	the Captain	1173	" I am sure I do n't know , except that they ca n't help it . But have you heard the great news of this evening ? "
236809	236814	236816	236820	the member of the Corporation	6396	" The reason is , "
236822	236913	236816	236820	the member of the Corporation	6396	" that they begin with being nobodies . They leave the whole management of their weddings to the women , and they never recover the reins . Miss Twemlow is one of the most charming of her sex ; but she has a decided character , which properly guided will be admirable . But to give it the lead at the outset would be fatal to future happiness . Therefore I take this affair upon myself . I pay for it all , and I mean to do it all . "
236914	236923	236924	236925	the Captain	1173	" What things you do learn in London ! "
236932	236961	236924	236925	the Captain	1173	" Oh , if I had only had the money but it is too late to talk of that . Once more , have you heard the news ? "
236962	237018	236924	236925	the Captain	1173	" About the great battle , and the death of Nelson ? Yes , I heard of all that this morning . But I left it to come in proper course from you . Now here we are ; mind you back me up . The Lord Mayor is coming to be my best man . "
237087	237095	237096	237097	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" It ca n't be done now , "
237100	237140	237096	237097	Mr. Shargeloes	580	" and after all , Eliza is the proper person . I must leave that to her , but nothing else that I can think of . There ca n't be much harm in my letting her do that . "
237342	237355	237337	237337	he	7767	" No flags at half - mast for me , my pets ! "
237666	237669	237662	237662	he	6430	" Captain Scuddy "
238124	238132	238133	238134	the boy	7259	" Thy servant will see to it , "
238171	238175	238177	238177	Dolly	277	" His behaviour , "
238186	238228	238180	238180	she	277	" has been perfect . How thankful I feel for it ! He never cast one glance at me . He quite enters into my feelings towards him . But how much more credit to his mind than to his heart ! "
238371	238377	238379	238380	the bridesmaid	6470	" You , Captain Scudamore ! "
238393	238406	238385	238385	she	6470	" You must have lost your way . This path leads nowhere . "
238407	238440	238385	238385	she	6470	" If it only leads to you , that is all that I could wish for . I am content to go to nothing , if I may only go with you . "
238441	238447	238449	238449	Dolly	277	" My brother sent me , "
238477	238521	238474	238474	her	277	" to search for a primrose or two for him to wear when he dines at the rectory this evening . We shall not go , of course . We have done enough . But Frank and Johnny think they ought to go . "
238522	238556	238557	238557	Blyth	429	" May I help you to look ? I am lucky in that way . I used to find so many things with you , in the happy times that used to be . "
238567	238593	238557	238557	Blyth	429	" I will go away , if you would rather have it so . But you used to be so good - natured to me . "
238594	238627	238474	238474	her	277	" So I am still . Or at least I mean that people should now be good - natured to me . Oh , Captain Scudamore , how foolish I have been ! "
238628	238647	238654	238654	he	578	" Do n't say so , do n't think it , do n't believe it for a moment , "
238666	238738	238654	238654	he	578	" Oh , Dolly , Dolly , you know you meant no harm . You are breaking your darling heart , when you do n't deserve it . I could not bear to look at you , and think of it , this morning . Everybody loves you still , as much and more than ever . Oh , Dolly , I would rather die than see you cry so terribly . "
238739	238796	238805	238806	the Captain	1173	" Nobody loves me , and I hate myself . I could never have believed I should ever hate myself . Go away , you are too good to be near me . Go away , or I shall think you want to kill me . And I wish you would do it , Captain Scudamore . "
238797	238803	238805	238806	the Captain	1173	" Then let me stop , "
238839	238873	238825	238825	she	6473	" Only tell me one thing may I hold you ? Not of course from any right to do it , but because you are so overcome , my own , own Dolly . "
238925	238936	238937	238937	he	1173	" You know that I never could help loving you , "
238950	238961	238941	238941	she	6473	" May I ever hope that you will like me ? "
238962	239020	239029	239029	she	6473	" Me ! How can it matter now to anybody ? I used to think it did ; but I was very foolish then . I know my own value . It is less than this . This little flower has been a good creature . It has been true to its place , and hurt nobody . "
239052	239066	239029	239029	she	6473	" If you give it to me , I shall have some hope . "
239135	239145	239146	239146	she	6473	" You may have it , if you like , "
239149	239182	239146	239146	she	6473	" but , Blyth , I shall never deserve you . I have behaved to you shamefully . And I feel as if I could never bear to be forgiven for it . "
239395	239408	239410	239411	the Rector	909	" Attention , my dear friends , attention , if you please , "
239422	239641	239410	239411	the Rector	909	" I will crave your attention before the ladies go , and theirs , for it concerns them equally . We have passed through a period of dark peril , a long time of trouble and anxiety and doubt . By the mercy of the Lord , we have escaped ; but with losses that have emptied our poor hearts . England has lost her two foremost defenders , Lord Nelson , and Admiral Darling . To them we owe it that we are now beginning the New Year happily , with the blessing of Heaven , and my dear daughter married . Next week we shall attend the grand funeral of the hero , and obtain good places by due influence . My son - in - law , Percival Shargeloes , can do just as he pleases at St. Paul 's . Therefore let us now , with deep thanksgiving , and one hand upon our hearts , lift up our glasses , and in silence pledge the memory of our greatest men . With the spirit of Britons we echo the last words that fell from the lips of our dying hero ' Thank God , I have done my duty ! ' His memory shall abide for ever , because he loved his country . "
239656	239659	239410	239411	the Rector	909	" Amen ! "
