2997	2999	2989	2989	he	112	" Sacerdos "
4145	4150	4136	4136	He	125	" John Bold , Surgeon "
5475	5479	5480	5480	he	572	" My dear , "
5493	5517	5480	5480	he	572	" there was that John Bold at your father 's again to - day . I must say your father is very imprudent . "
5518	5527	5529	5530	Mrs Grantly	133	" He is imprudent ; he always was , "
5541	5549	5529	5530	Mrs Grantly	133	" There 's nothing new in that . "
5550	5606	5480	5480	he	572	" No , my dear , there 's nothing new ; I know that ; but , at the present juncture of affairs , such imprudence is is I 'll tell you what , my dear , if he does not take care what he 's about , John Bold will be off with Eleanor . "
5607	5624	5529	5530	Mrs Grantly	133	" I think he will , whether papa takes care or no ; and why not ? "
5625	5629	5632	5633	the archdeacon	381	" Why not ! "
5652	5693	5632	5633	the archdeacon	381	" why not ! that pestilent , interfering upstart , John Bold ; the most vulgar young person I ever met ! Do you know that he is meddling with your father 's affairs in a most uncalled - for most "
5714	5718	5705	5705	he	381	" Good heavens ! "
5746	5753	5754	5755	Mrs Grantly	133	" As to his vulgarity , archdeacon "
5770	5838	5754	5755	Mrs Grantly	133	" I do n't agree with you . Not that I like Mr Bold ; he is a great deal too conceited for me ; but then Eleanor does , and it would be the best thing in the world for papa if they were to marry . Bold would never trouble himself about Hiram 's Hospital if he were papa 's son - in - law . "
5887	5891	5893	5894	the doctor	610	" Good heavens ! "
6221	6243	6247	6247	he	623	" They are church revenues : the laity admit it . Surely the church is able to administer her own revenues . "
6550	6554	6556	6556	he	381	" Good heavens ! "
7290	7304	7306	7306	Bold	125	" And who is competent to give you that authority , Mr Chadwick ? "
7308	7318	7320	7321	the steward	345	" Only those who employ me , Mr Bold , "
7323	7332	7334	7334	Bold	125	" And who are those , Mr Chadwick ? "
7590	7614	7571	7571	Finney	135	" Slap at them at once , Mr Bold . Demand categorically and explicitly a full statement of the affairs of the hospital . "
7615	7625	7627	7627	Bold	126	" Suppose I were to see Mr Harding first , "
7629	7638	7642	7642	Finney	135	" Yes , yes , by all means , "
7644	7688	7642	7642	Finney	135	" though , perhaps , as Mr Harding is no man of business , it may lead lead to some little difficulties ; but perhaps you 're right . Mr Bold , I do n't think seeing Mr Harding can do any harm . "
8446	8463	8464	8464	he	141	" Well , well , Mr Harding ; you 're too good , much too good , "
8769	8782	8784	8784	Bold	126	" Pray , Mr Harding pray do n't let me disturb you , "
8786	8797	8784	8784	Bold	126	" you know how fond I am of sacred music . "
8798	8805	8807	8808	the precentor	440	" Oh ! it 's nothing , "
8851	8894	8840	8840	I	0	" Well , I 'll just finish it then ; it 's a favourite little bit of Bishop 's ; and then , Mr Bold , we 'll have a stroll and a chat till Eleanor comes in and gives us tea . "
9016	9021	9023	9023	he	126	" One evening call , "
9025	9069	9023	9023	he	126	" is worth ten in the morning . It 's all formality in the morning ; real social talk never begins till after dinner . That 's why I dine early , so as to get as much as I can of it . "
9070	9077	9079	9080	the other	757	" Quite true , Mr Harding , "
9082	9122	9079	9080	the other	757	" but I fear I 've reversed the order of things , and I owe you much apology for troubling you on business at such an hour ; but it is on business that I have called just now . "
9166	9177	9179	9179	Bold	126	" I wish to speak to you about the hospital , "
9181	9196	9079	9080	the other	757	" Well , well , anything I can tell you I shall be most happy "
9197	9204	9079	9080	the other	757	" It 's about the accounts . "
9205	9269	9079	9080	the other	757	" Then , my dear fellow , I can tell you nothing , for I 'm as ignorant as a child . All I know is , that they pay me L800 a year . Go to Chadwick , he knows all about the accounts ; and now tell me , will poor Mary Jones ever get the use of her limb again ? "
9270	9307	9079	9080	the other	757	" Well , I think she will , if she 's careful ; but , Mr Harding , I hope you wo n't object to discuss with me what I have to say about the hospital . "
9369	9381	9383	9383	Bold	125	" I have the greatest regard for you , Mr Harding , "
9385	9393	9383	9383	Bold	125	" the truest respect , the most sincere "
9394	9404	9406	9407	the precentor	440	" Thank ye , thank ye , Mr Bold , "
9411	9439	9406	9407	the precentor	440	" I 'm much obliged , but never mind that ; I 'm as likely to be in the wrong as another man , quite as likely . "
9440	9469	9383	9383	Bold	125	" But , Mr Harding , I must express what I feel , lest you should think there is personal enmity in what I 'm going to do . "
9470	9497	9406	9407	the precentor	440	" Personal enmity ! Going to do ! Why , you 're not going to cut my throat , nor put me into the Ecclesiastical Court ! "
9562	9586	9588	9590	the young man	758	" I fear there is reason to think that John Hiram 's will is not carried out to the letter , Mr Harding , "
9594	9605	9588	9590	the young man	758	" and I have been asked to see into it . "
9606	9628	9536	9536	he	125	" Very well , I 've no objection on earth ; and now we need not say another word about it . "
9629	9688	9588	9590	the young man	758	" Only one word more , Mr Harding . Chadwick has referred me to Cox and Cummins , and I think it my duty to apply to them for some statement about the hospital . In what I do I may appear to be interfering with you , and I hope you will forgive me for doing so . "
9689	9693	9695	9696	the other	757	" Mr Bold , "
9706	9860	9695	9696	the other	757	" if you act justly , say nothing in this matter but the truth , and use no unfair weapons in carrying out your purposes , I shall have nothing to forgive . I presume you think I am not entitled to the income I receive from the hospital , and that others are entitled to it . Whatever some may do , I shall never attribute to you base motives because you hold an opinion opposed to my own and adverse to my interests : pray do what you consider to be your duty ; I can give you no assistance , neither will I offer you any obstacle . Let me , however , suggest to you , that you can in no wise forward your views nor I mine , by any discussion between us . Here comes Eleanor and the ponies , and we 'll go in to tea . "
11361	11368	11369	11369	he	254	" Refer him to the archdeacon , "
11382	11393	11394	11394	he	254	" The archdeacon will set you quite right about that , "
11411	11425	11394	11394	he	254	" No man has got up all that so well as the archdeacon ; "
11445	11450	11452	11452	he	254	" But , bishop , "
11454	11464	11452	11452	he	254	" did you ever read John Hiram 's will ? "
11521	11571	11572	11573	The bishop	254	" But , bishop , the question is , who has the power to settle it ? If , as this young man says , the will provides that the proceeds of the property are to be divided into shares , who has the power to alter these provisions ? "
11758	11761	11763	11763	he	254	" Bishop , "
11777	11836	11763	11763	he	254	" I should deceive you and myself too , if I did not tell you that I am very unhappy about this . Suppose that I can not bring myself to agree with Dr Grantly ! that I find , after inquiry , that the young man is right , and that I am wrong , what then ? "
11971	11974	11953	11954	the bishop	254	" pestilent intruder "
12051	12063	12064	12065	The bishop	254	" He is very intimate at my own house , bishop . "
12134	12145	12147	12149	the disinterested victim	875	" Indeed , I like Mr Bold much , personally , "
12151	12161	12162	12162	he	254	" and to tell you the ' truth , ' "
12172	12192	12162	12162	he	254	" I have sometimes thought it not improbable that he would be my second son - in - law . "
12411	12479	12393	12393	he	153	" I do not say that there is any engagement between them . Had there been , Eleanor would have told me ; I know her well enough to be assured that she would have done so ; but I see that they are fond of each other ; and as a man and a father , I have had no objection to urge against their intimacy . "
12480	12486	12488	12489	the bishop	254	" But , Mr Harding , "
12491	12509	12488	12489	the bishop	254	" how are you to oppose him , if he is your son - in - law ? "
12510	12544	12393	12393	he	153	" I do n't mean to oppose him ; it is he who opposes me ; if anything is to be done in defence , I suppose Chadwick will do it . I suppose "
12545	12582	12488	12489	the bishop	254	" Oh , the archdeacon will see to that : were the young man twice his brother - in - law , the archdeacon will never be deterred from doing what he feels to be right . "
12941	12948	12925	12925	he	125	" Fiat justitia , ruat colum . "
13016	13033	13053	13053	him	123	" Each one of you is clearly entitled to one hundred pounds a year by common law "
13453	13457	13463	13464	Job Skulpit	144	" Job Skulpit ; "
13746	13756	13760	13760	Moody	145	" To be kept out of all that money , "
13768	13785	13760	13760	Moody	145	" by an old fool saying that he can write his own name like his betters ! "
13786	13791	13793	13793	Handy	123	" Well , Job , "
13837	13851	13834	13834	d'ye	958	" and he put his huge brown finger down on the dirty paper ; "
13891	13891	13888	13888	my	0	"
13892	13897	13899	13899	Moody	145	" To be sure , "
13901	13921	13899	13899	Moody	145	" We a'n't none of us so young ; we ca n't stay waiting for old Catgut no longer . "
13967	13975	13977	13977	Spriggs	146	" Only think , old Billy Gazy , "
14035	14053	14055	14055	he	146	" a hundred a year , and all to spend ; only think , old Billy Gazy ; "
14111	14125	14136	14136	Spriggs	146	" he did n't know , not he ; he did n't know . "
14126	14134	14136	14136	Spriggs	146	" But you 'd know , Jonathan , "
14239	14255	14257	14257	he	148	" A hundred a year 's a nice thing , for sartain , neighbour Spriggs , "
14259	14277	14257	14257	he	148	" I once had nigh to that myself , but it did n't do me no good . "
14300	14308	14310	14310	Handy	123	" And shall have again , Joe , "
14312	14328	14310	14310	Handy	123	" and will have someone to keep it right and tight for you this time . "
14363	14368	14370	14370	Handy	123	" Come , Skulpit , "
14375	14407	14408	14408	he	123	" you 're not going to go along with old Bunce in helping that parson to rob us all . Take the pen , man , and right yourself . Well , "
14417	14441	14408	14408	he	123	" to see a man as is afraid to stand by hisself is , to my thinking , the meanest thing as is . "
14442	14452	14454	14454	Moody	145	" Sink them all for parsons , says I , "
14456	14474	14454	14454	Moody	145	" hungry beggars , as never thinks their bellies full till they have robbed all and everything ! "
14475	14484	14486	14486	Spriggs	146	" Who 's to harm you , man ? "
14488	14523	14486	14486	Spriggs	146	" Let them look never so black at you , they ca n't get you put out when you 're once in ; no , not old Catgut , with Calves to help him ! "
14543	14556	14558	14558	Handy	123	" A hundred a year to win , and nothing to lose , "
14560	14616	14558	14558	Handy	123	" My eyes ! Well , how a man 's to doubt about sich a bit of cheese as that passes me ; but some men is timorous ; some men is born with no pluck in them ; some men is cowed at the very first sight of a gentleman 's coat and waistcoat . "
14647	14653	14655	14655	Moody	145	" Afraid of a parson , "
14664	14711	14655	14655	Moody	145	" I tell ye what I 'd be afraid of I 'd be afraid of not getting nothing from 'em but just what I could take by might and right ; that 's the most I 'd be afraid on of any parson of 'em all . "
14712	14715	14717	14717	Skulpit	144	" But , "
14721	14742	14717	14717	Skulpit	144	" Mr Harding 's not so bad ; he did give us twopence a day , did n't he now ? "
14743	14748	14750	14750	Spriggs	146	" Twopence a day ! "
14764	14769	14771	14771	Moody	145	" Twopence a day ! "
14781	14781	14717	14717	Skulpit	144	"
14782	14787	14789	14789	Handy	123	" Twopence a day ! "
14791	14864	14789	14789	Handy	123	" and I 'm to go , hat in hand , and thank a chap for twopence a day , when he owes me a hundred pounds a year ; no , thank ye ; that may do for you , but it wo n't for me . Come , I say , Skulpit , are you a going to put your mark to this here paper , or are you not ? "
14876	14884	14886	14886	he	144	" What d'ye think , Bill Gazy ? "
14922	14928	14895	14895	He	147	" he did n't know . "
14929	14937	14939	14939	Handy	123	" Take hold , you old cripple , "
14950	14988	14939	14939	Handy	123	" there , so ugh ! you old fool , you 've been and smeared it all , there , that 'll do for you ; that 's as good as the best name as ever was written "
15005	15010	15012	15012	Handy	123	" Now , Jonathan , "
15018	15031	15034	15034	Crumple	148	" A hundred a year 's a nice thing , for sartain , "
15036	15048	15034	15034	Crumple	148	" Well , neighbour Skulpit , how 's it to be ? "
15049	15055	15057	15057	Skulpit	144	" Oh , please yourself , "
15059	15069	15057	15057	Skulpit	144	" please yourself , and you 'll please me . "
15103	15108	15110	15110	Handy	123	" Come , Job , "
15116	15174	15110	15110	Handy	123	" do n't let 'em have to say that old Bunce has a man like you under his thumb , a man that always holds his head in the hospital as high as Bunce himself , though you 're never axed to drink wine , and sneak , and tell lies about your betters as he does . "
15194	15204	15206	15206	Handy	123	" And if you 'll be said by me , "
15208	15229	15206	15206	Handy	123	" you 'll not write your name to it at all , but just put your mark like the others ; "
15240	15265	15236	15236	Skulpit	144	" we all know you can do it if you like , but maybe you would n't like to seem uppish , you know . "
15266	15275	15277	15277	Skulpit	144	" Well , the mark would be best , "
15279	15294	15277	15277	Skulpit	144	" One name and the rest marks would n't look well , would it ? "
15295	15302	15304	15304	Handy	123	" The worst in the world , "
15306	15309	15304	15304	Handy	123	" there there "
15332	15338	15340	15340	Handy	123	" That 's the game , "
15347	15376	15340	15340	Handy	123	" we 're all in a boat now , that is , the nine of us ; and as for old Bunce , and his cronies , they may "
15407	15418	15420	15426	the gray - haired , upright senior	977	" Well Handy , and what may old Bunce do ? "
15451	15463	15465	15465	he	977	" You 've been doing no good here , Abel Handy , "
15467	15489	15465	15465	he	977	" ' tis plain to see that ; and ' tisn't much good , I 'm thinking , you ever do . "
15490	15500	15502	15503	the other	757	" I mind my own business , Master Bunce , "
15505	15539	15502	15503	the other	757	" and do you do the same . It ai n't nothing to you what I does ; and your spying and poking here wo n't do no good nor yet no harm . "
15540	15547	15549	15549	Bunce	141	" I suppose then , Job , "
15556	15576	15549	15549	Bunce	141	" if the truth must out , you 've stuck your name to that petition of theirs at last . "
15592	15602	15604	15604	Handy	123	" What is it to you what he signs ? "
15606	15661	15604	15604	Handy	123	" I suppose if we all wants to ax for our own , we need n't ax leave of you first , Mr Bunce , big a man as you are ; and as to your sneaking in here , into Job 's room when he 's busy , and where you 're not wanted "
15662	15676	15678	15678	Bunce	141	" I 've knowed Job Skulpit , man and boy , sixty years , "
15689	15760	15678	15678	Bunce	141	" and that 's ever since the day he was born . I knowed the mother that bore him , when she and I were little wee things , picking daisies together in the close yonder ; and I 've lived under the same roof with him more nor ten years ; and after that I may come into his room without axing leave , and yet no sneaking neither . "
15761	15769	15771	15771	Skulpit	144	" So you can , Mr Bunce , "
15785	15785	15771	15771	Skulpit	144	"
15786	15798	15800	15800	Bunce	141	" And I 'm free also to tell him my mind , "
15812	15907	15909	15909	he	141	" and I tell him now that he 's done a foolish and a wrong thing . He 's turned his back upon one who is his best friend ; and is playing the game of others , who care nothing for him , whether he be poor or rich , well or ill , alive or dead . A hundred a year ? Are the lot of you soft enough to think that if a hundred a year be to be given , it 's the likes of you that will get it ? "
15920	15977	15979	15980	the orator	984	" Did any of us ever do anything worth half the money ? Was it to make gentlemen of us we were brought in here , when all the world turned against us , and we could n't longer earn our daily bread ? A'n't you all as rich in your ways as he in his ? "
15991	16032	15979	15980	the orator	984	" A'n't you getting all you hoped for , ay , and more than you hoped for ? Would n't each of you have given the dearest limb of his body to secure that which now makes you so unthankful ? "
16033	16042	16044	16044	Handy	123	" We wants what John Hiram left us , "
16046	16080	16044	16044	Handy	123	" We wants what 's ourn by law ; it do n't matter what we expected . What 's ourn by law should be ourn , and by goles we 'll have it . "
16081	16084	16086	16086	Bunce	141	" Law ! "
16097	16157	16044	16044	Handy	123	" law ! Did ye ever know a poor man yet was the better for law , or for a lawyer ? Will Mr Finney ever be as good to you , Job , as that man has been ? Will he see to you when you 're sick , and comfort you when you 're wretched ? Will he "

16255	16268	16248	16249	Jonathan Crumple	148	" for sartain , sure a hundred a year was very nice ; "
16281	16287	16270	16271	Billy Gazy	147	" he did n't know . "
16656	16662	16663	16663	he	112	" Well , Mr Chadwick , "
16689	16698	16663	16663	he	112	" anything from Cox and Cummins this morning ? "
16780	16787	16789	16790	Dr Grantly	112	" I quite agree with them , "
16796	16844	16789	16790	Dr Grantly	112	" I perfectly agree with them . Haphazard is no doubt the best man ; a thorough churchman , a sound conservative , and in every respect the best man we could get ; he 's in the House , too , which is a great thing . "
16850	16882	16845	16846	Mr Chadwick	114	" You remember how completely he put down that scoundrel Horseman about the Bishop of Beverley 's income ; how completely he set them all adrift in the earl 's case . "
16901	16905	16845	16846	Mr Chadwick	114	" the earl , "
16915	16958	16845	16846	Mr Chadwick	114	" How he silenced that fellow at Rochester . Of course we must have Haphazard ; and I 'll tell you what , Mr Chadwick , we must take care to be in time , or the other party will forestall us . "

17527	17535	17537	17538	the archdeacon	381	" We must soon be doing something , "
17572	17582	17553	17553	he	381	" Of course you have heard of the petition ? "
17597	17600	17601	17602	the archdeacon	381	" Well ! "
17617	17646	17614	17614	he	381	" We must be doing something , you know ; we must n't allow these people to cut the ground from under us while we sit looking on . "
17894	17903	17905	17906	the archdeacon	381	" I quite agree with Cox and Cummins , "
17908	17935	17905	17906	the archdeacon	381	" They say we must secure Sir Abraham Haphazard . I shall not have the slightest fear in leaving the case in Sir Abraham 's hands . "
17955	17989	17990	17991	The warden	313	" I think Sir Abraham will not be long in letting Master Bold know what he 's about . I fancy I hear Sir Abraham cross - questioning him at the Common Pleas . "
18028	18041	18042	18043	The warden	313	" I suppose they 've sent this petition up to my father . "
18058	18105	18161	18162	the warden	313	" What I ca n't understand is , how you let them do it , with such a command as you have in the place , or should have with such a man as Bunce . I can not understand why you let them do it . "
18106	18110	18112	18113	the warden	313	" Do what ? "
18115	18150	18161	18162	the warden	313	" Why , listen to this fellow Bold , and that other low pettifogger , Finney ; and get up this petition too . Why did n't you tell Bunce to destroy the petition ? "
18151	18159	18161	18162	the warden	313	" That would have been hardly wise , "
18164	18213	18161	18162	the warden	313	" Wise ; yes , it would have been very wise if they 'd done it among themselves . I must go up to the palace and answer it now , I suppose . It 's a very short answer they 'll get , I can tell you . "
18214	18224	18161	18162	the warden	313	" But why should n't they petition , doctor ? "
18225	18231	18233	18234	the archdeacon	381	" Why should n't they ! "
18259	18294	18233	18234	the archdeacon	381	" why should n't they ? I 'll let them know why they should n't ; by the bye , warden , I 'd like to say a few words to them all together . "
18403	18415	18417	18417	he	313	" I 'd so much sooner remain quiet in the matter , "
18424	18427	18429	18430	the archdeacon	381	" Quiet ! "
18439	18449	18429	18430	the archdeacon	381	" do you wish to be ruined in quiet ? "
18450	18462	18435	18435	his	381	" Why , if I am to be ruined , certainly . "
18463	18502	18429	18430	the archdeacon	381	" Nonsense , warden ; I tell you something must be done ; we must act ; just let me ring the bell , and send the men word that I 'll speak to them in the quad . "
18808	18819	18821	18821	he	381	" Well , warden , of course you 're coming , "
18834	18842	18844	18845	Mr Harding	153	" I wish you 'd excuse me , "
18847	18863	18865	18866	the archdeacon	381	" For heaven 's sake , do n't let us have division in the camp , "
18868	18902	18865	18866	the archdeacon	381	" let us have a long pull and a strong pull , but above all a pull all together ; come , warden , come ; do n't be afraid of your duty . "
19091	19097	19099	19100	Abel Handy	123	" to his own cheek , "
19205	19212	19213	19213	he	141	" and the doctor 's lady , "
19221	19232	19213	19213	he	141	" and the children at Plumstead , and my lord ; "
19447	19453	19454	19454	he	141	" Now , my men , "
19467	19564	19454	19454	he	141	" I want to say a few words to you . Your good friend , the warden here , and myself , and my lord the bishop , on whose behalf I wish to speak to you , would all be very sorry , very sorry indeed , that you should have any just ground of complaint . Any just ground of complaint on your part would be removed at once by the warden , or by his lordship , or by me on his behalf , without the necessity of any petition on your part . "
19614	19624	19625	19625	he	141	" Without the necessity of any petition at all , "
19628	19641	19642	19642	He	141	" I 'm told you have addressed a petition to my lord . "
19663	19669	19656	19656	Handy	123	" Yes , we has . "
19670	19707	19656	19656	Handy	123	" You have addressed a petition to my lord , in which , as I am informed , you express an opinion that you do not receive from Hiram 's estate all that is your due . "
19717	19740	19714	19714	their	1147	" Now what is it you ask for ? What is it you want that you hav'n't got here ? What is it "
19741	19747	19749	19750	old Moody	145	" A hundred a year , "
19764	19770	19772	19773	the archdeacon	381	" A hundred a year ! "
19823	20094	19794	19794	he	145	" A hundred a year ! Why , my men , you must be mad ; and you talk about John Hiram 's will ! When John Hiram built a hospital for worn - out old men , worn - out old labouring men , infirm old men past their work , cripples , blind , bed - ridden , and such like , do you think he meant to make gentlemen of them ? Do you think John Hiram intended to give a hundred a year to old single men , who earned perhaps two shillings or half - a - crown a day for themselves and families in the best of their time ? No , my men , I 'll tell you what John Hiram meant : he meant that twelve poor old worn - out labourers , men who could no longer support themselves , who had no friends to support them , who must starve and perish miserably if not protected by the hand of charity ; he meant that twelve such men as these should come in here in their poverty and wretchedness , and find within these walls shelter and food before their death , and a little leisure to make their peace with God . That was what John Hiram meant : you have not read John Hiram 's will , and I doubt whether those wicked men who are advising you have done so . I have ; I know what his will was ; and I tell you that that was his will , and that that was his intention . "
20154	20161	20162	20162	he	381	" Now let me ask you , "
20165	20337	20162	20162	he	381	" do you think you are worse off than John Hiram intended to make you ? Have you not shelter , and food , and leisure ? Have you not much more ? Have you not every indulgence which you are capable of enjoying ? Have you not twice better food , twice a better bed , ten times more money in your pocket than you were ever able to earn for yourselves before you were lucky enough to get into this place ? And now you send a petition to the bishop , asking for a hundred pounds a year ! I tell you what , my friends ; you are deluded , and made fools of by wicked men who are acting for their own ends . You will never get a hundred pence a year more than what you have now : it is very possible that you may get less ; it is very possible that my lord the bishop , and your warden , may make changes "
20338	20345	20347	20348	Mr Harding	153	" No , no , no , "
20368	20403	20347	20348	Mr Harding	153	" no , my friends . I want no changes , at least no changes that shall make you worse off than you now are , as long as you and I live together . "
20404	20412	20414	20414	Bunce	141	" God bless you , Mr Harding , "
20417	20439	20414	20414	Bunce	141	" God bless you , Mr Harding , God bless you , sir : we know you was always our friend , "
20506	20509	20511	20511	he	381	" Well , "
20529	20538	20540	20540	he	381	" I think I spoke to them plainly . "
20575	20583	20585	20586	the warden	313	" Yes , you were plain enough , "
20597	20603	20614	20614	himself	1163	" And that 's everything , "
20616	20655	20614	20614	himself	1163	" that 's everything : with those sort of people one must be plain , or one will not be understood . Now , I think they did understand me ; I think they knew what I meant . "
20676	20747	20660	20660	He	313	" They know pretty well what they have to expect from us ; they know how we shall meet any refractory spirit on their part ; they know that we are not afraid of them . And now I 'll just step into Chadwick 's , and tell him what I 've done ; and then I 'll go up to the palace , and answer this petition of theirs . "
21688	21718	21685	21685	him	288	" Oh , I was thinking of Bold , so I took it into my head to write to him myself , but you must write to his sister . "
21895	21899	21901	21901	Mary	162	" How odd , "
21903	21926	21901	21901	Mary	162	" that they should send two notes . Well , if Mr Harding becomes fashionable , the world is going to change . "
22091	22094	22096	22096	she	532	" Well , "
22098	22116	22096	22096	she	532	" I suppose we must write separate answers , and both say we shall be very happy . "
22117	22127	22129	22129	he	125	" You 'll go , of course , Mary , "
22137	22142	22143	22143	he	125	" I can not , "
22151	22162	22143	22143	he	125	" I wish I could , with all my heart . "
22163	22170	22172	22172	she	532	" And why not , John ? "
22241	22263	22323	22323	she	532	" I fear I can not go to Mr Harding 's house any more as a friend , just at present . "
22264	22280	22323	22323	she	532	" Oh , John ! Why not ? Ah , you 've quarrelled with Eleanor ! "
22281	22286	22288	22288	he	125	" No , indeed , "
22290	22300	22288	22288	he	125	" I 've no quarrel with her as yet . "
22301	22308	22310	22310	she	532	" What is it , John ? "
22345	22348	22350	22350	he	125	" Why , "
22354	22398	22350	22350	he	125	" I 've taken up the case of these twelve old men of Hiram 's Hospital , and of course that brings me into contact with Mr Harding . I may have to oppose him , interfere with him , perhaps injure him . "
22429	22497	22408	22408	she	162	" Why , it 's a long story , and I do n't know that I can make you understand it . John Hiram made a will , and left his property in charity for certain poor old men , and the proceeds , instead of going to the benefit of these men , go chiefly into the pocket of the warden and the bishop 's steward . "
22498	22513	22399	22399	Mary	162	" And you mean to take away from Mr Harding his share of it ? "
22514	22593	22408	22408	she	162	" I do n't know what I mean yet . I mean to inquire about it . I mean to see who is entitled to this property . I mean to see , if I can , that justice be done to the poor of the city of Barchester generally , who are , in fact , the legatees under the will . I mean , in short , to put the matter right , if I can . "
22594	22605	22399	22399	Mary	162	" And why are you to do this , John ? "
22606	22617	22619	22619	he	1227	" You might ask the same question of anybody else , "
22621	22672	22619	22619	he	1227	" and according to that the duty of righting these poor men would belong to nobody . If we are to act on that principle , the weak are never to be protected , injustice is never to be opposed , and no one is to struggle for the poor ! "
22687	22726	22399	22399	Mary	162	" But is there no one to do this but you , who have known Mr Harding so long ? Surely , John , as a friend , as a young friend , so much younger than Mr Harding "
22727	22829	22619	22619	he	1227	" That 's woman 's logic , all over , Mary . What has age to do with it ? Another man might plead that he was too old ; and as to his friendship , if the thing itself be right , private motives should never be allowed to interfere . Because I esteem Mr Harding , is that a reason that I should neglect a duty which I owe to these old men ? or should I give up a work which my conscience tells me is a good one , because I regret the loss of his society ? "
22830	22836	22838	22839	the sister	1228	" And Eleanor , John ? "
22849	22934	22936	22936	Bold	125	" Eleanor , that is , Miss Harding , if she thinks fit , that is , if her father or , rather , if she or , indeed , he , if they find it necessary but there is no necessity now to talk about Eleanor Harding ; but this I will say , that if she has the kind of spirit for which I give her credit , she will not condemn me for doing what I think to be a duty . "
23010	23022	23007	23008	her brother	526	" Well , Mary , why do n't you write it ? "
23023	23028	23030	23030	she	162	" Oh , John , "
23032	23042	23030	23030	she	162	" dear John , pray think better of this . "
23043	23049	23051	23051	he	526	" Think better of what ? "
23053	23116	23007	23008	her brother	526	" Of this about the hospital , of all this about Mr Harding , of what you say about those old men . Nothing can call upon you , no duty can require you to set yourself against your oldest , your best friend . Oh , John , think of Eleanor . You 'll break her heart , and your own . "
23117	23132	23007	23008	her brother	526	" Nonsense , Mary ; Miss Harding 's heart is as safe as yours . "
23133	23156	23158	23158	she	1234	" Pray , pray , for my sake , John , give it up . You know how dearly you love her . "
23168	23221	23158	23158	she	1234	" Pray give it up . You are going to make yourself , and her , and her father miserable : you are going to make us all miserable . And for what ? For a dream of justice . You will never make those twelve men happier than they now are . "
23222	23233	23235	23235	he	1235	" You do n't understand it , my dear girl , "
23244	23361	23362	23362	He	1236	" I do understand it , John . I understand that this is a chimera , a dream that you have got . I know well that no duty can require you to do this mad this suicidal thing . I know you love Eleanor Harding with all your heart , and I tell you now that she loves you as well . If there was a plain , a positive duty before you , I would be the last to bid you neglect it for any woman 's love ; but this ; oh , think again , before you do anything to make it necessary that you and Mr Harding should be at variance . "
23390	23420	23381	23381	she	1237	" At any rate let me say that you will go to this party . At any rate do not break with them while your mind is in doubt . "
23437	23445	23448	23448	he	1236	" My mind is not in doubt , "
23453	23541	23448	23448	he	1236	" I could never respect myself again were I to give way now , because Eleanor Harding is beautiful . I do love her : I would give a hand to hear her tell me what you have said , speaking on her behalf ; but I can not for her sake go back from the task which I have commenced . I hope she may hereafter acknowledge and respect my motives , but I can not now go as a guest to her father 's house . "
24740	24746	24748	24749	the archdeacon	381	" As David did Goliath , "
24805	24812	24814	24815	the archdeacon	381	" What , no second club ? "
24820	24825	24831	24833	the pursy rector	1295	" Only one club , "
24911	24927	24903	24907	the red - faced rector	1299	" two by cards and two by honours , and the odd trick last time , "
25131	25137	25128	25128	he	1292	" three and thirty points ! "
25138	25144	25128	25128	he	1292	" three and thirty points ! "
25302	25307	25309	25309	he	313	" Well , Eleanor , "
25311	25317	25309	25309	he	313	" are you for bed ? "
25318	25321	25323	25323	she	275	" Yes , "
25327	25347	25323	25323	she	275	" I suppose so ; but papa Mr Bold was not here tonight ; do you know why not ? "
25348	25359	25361	25362	the warden	313	" He was asked ; I wrote to him myself , "
25364	25377	25323	25323	she	275	" But do you know why he did not come , papa ? "
25378	25409	25323	25323	she	275	" Well , Eleanor , I could guess ; but it 's no use guessing at such things , my dear . What makes you look so earnest about it ? "
25410	25419	25420	25420	she	275	" Oh , papa , do tell me , "
25435	25456	25420	25420	she	275	" what is it he is going to do ? What is it all about ? Is there any any any "
25466	25470	25457	25457	she	275	" any danger ? "
25471	25482	25424	25424	her	275	" Danger , my dear , what sort of danger ? "
25483	25513	25457	25457	she	275	" Danger to you , danger of trouble , and of loss , and of Oh , papa , why have n't you told me of all this before ? "
25699	25705	25706	25706	he	153	" Tell me , Nelly , "
25732	25745	25725	25725	his	153	" tell me , Nelly , do you like Mr Bold much ? "
25912	25920	25903	25903	She	1325	" Do I like him , papa ? "
25921	25950	25951	25951	She	1325	" Yes , Nelly , do you like him ? Why should n't you like him ? but that 's a poor word ; do you love him ? "
25995	26001	26003	26003	he	125	" Come , my love , "
26005	26035	26003	26003	he	125	" let us make a clean breast of it : do you tell me what concerns yourself , and I will tell you what concerns me and the hospital . "
26333	26339	26341	26341	he	125	" My sister tells me , "
26351	26376	26341	26341	he	125	" my sister tells me that you had a delightful party the other evening . I was so sorry I could not be there . "
26377	26383	26385	26385	Eleanor	110	" We were all sorry , "
26391	26405	26407	26407	Bold	125	" I believe , Miss Harding , you understand why , at this moment "
26433	26445	26341	26341	he	125	" I think my sister explained to you , Miss Harding ? "
26446	26504	26341	26341	he	125	" Pray do n't apologise , Mr Bold ; my father will , I am sure , always be glad to see you , if you like to come to the house now as formerly ; nothing has occurred to alter his feelings : of your own views you are , of course , the best judge . "
26505	26538	26341	26341	he	125	" Your father is all that is kind and generous ; he always was so ; but you , Miss Harding , yourself I hope you will not judge me harshly , because "
26539	26543	26545	26545	she	1347	" Mr Bold , "
26547	26640	26545	26545	she	1347	" you may be sure of one thing ; I shall always judge my father to be right , and those who oppose him I shall judge to be wrong . If those who do not know him oppose him , I shall have charity enough to believe that they are wrong , through error of judgment ; but should I see him attacked by those who ought to know him , and to love him , and revere him , of such I shall be constrained to form a different opinion . "
27306	27656	27680	27680	They	1373	" Another case , of smaller dimensions indeed , but of similar import , is now likely to come under public notice . We are informed that the warden or master of an old almshouse attached to Barchester Cathedral is in receipt of twenty - five times the annual income appointed for him by the will of the founder , while the sum yearly expended on the absolute purposes of the charity has always remained fixed . In other words , the legatees under the founder 's will have received no advantage from the increase in the value of the property during the last four centuries , such increase having been absorbed by the so - called warden . It is impossible to conceive a case of greater injustice . It is no answer to say that some six or nine or twelve old men receive as much of the goods of this world as such old men require . On what foundation , moral or divine , traditional or legal , is grounded the warden 's claim to the large income he receives for doing nothing ? The contentment of these almsmen , if content they be , can give him no title to this wealth ! Does he ever ask himself , when he stretches wide his clerical palm to receive the pay of some dozen of the working clergy , for what service he is so remunerated ? Does his conscience ever entertain the question of his right to such subsidies ? Or is it possible that the subject never so presents itself to his mind ; that he has received for many years , and intends , should God spare him , to receive for years to come these fruits of the industrious piety of past ages , indifferent as to any right on his own part , or of any injustice to others ! We must express an opinion that nowhere but in the Church of England , and only there among its priests , could such a state of moral indifference be found . "

27829	27832	27834	27835	the archdeacon	381	" Yes , "
27844	28091	27834	27835	the archdeacon	381	" yes , and be smothered with ridicule ; tossed over and over again with scorn ; shaken this way and that , as a rat in the mouth of a practised terrier . You will leave out some word or letter in your answer , and the ignorance of the cathedral clergy will be harped upon ; you will make some small mistake , which will be a falsehood , or some admission , which will be self - condemnation ; you will find yourself to have been vulgar , ill - tempered , irreverend , and illiterate , and the chances are ten to one , but that being a clergyman , you will have been guilty of blasphemy ! A man may have the best of causes , the best of talents , and the best of tempers ; he may write as well as Addison , or as strongly as Junius ; but even with all this he can not successfully answer , when attacked by The Jupiter . In such matters it is omnipotent . What the Czar is in Russia , or the mob in America , that The Jupiter is in England . Answer such an article ! No , warden ; whatever you do , do n't do that . We were to look for this sort of thing , you know ; but we need not draw down on our heads more of it than is necessary . "
28393	28406	28384	28385	The Jupiter	171	" each one of us , Jonathan Crumple , think of that ! "

28977	28987	28989	28990	the latter	1434	" It 's all your own fault , archdeacon , "
28992	29014	28989	28990	the latter	1434	" I told you from the beginning how it would end , and papa has no one to thank but you . "
29015	29022	29024	29025	the doctor	610	" Good gracious , my dear , "
29053	29067	29024	29025	the doctor	610	" how can you say so ? I am doing my very best . "
29068	29078	29080	29081	the lady	609	" I wish you had never done so much , "
29086	29130	29080	29081	the lady	609	" If you 'd just have let John Bold come and go there , as he and papa liked , he and Eleanor would have been married by this time , and we should not have heard one word about all this affair . "
29131	29136	29024	29025	the doctor	610	" But , my dear "
29137	29194	29080	29081	the lady	609	" Oh , it 's all very well , archdeacon ; and of course you 're right ; I do n't for a moment think you 'll ever admit that you could be wrong ; but the fact is , you 've brought this young man down upon papa by huffing him as you have done . "
29195	29200	29024	29025	the doctor	610	" But , my love "
29201	29275	29277	29279	the anxious sister	1438	" And all because you did n't like John Bold for a brother - in - law . How is she ever to do better ? Papa has n't got a shilling ; and though Eleanor is well enough , she has not at all a taking style of beauty . I 'm sure I do n't know how she 's to do better than marry John Bold ; or as well indeed , "
29397	29401	29393	29393	his	125	" no surrender ; "
29472	29478	29480	29480	she	133	" Oh , Sir Abraham ! "
29494	29579	29480	29480	she	133	" Sir Abraham wo n't get Eleanor a husband ; Sir Abraham wo n't get papa another income when he has been worreted out of the hospital . Mark what I tell you , archdeacon : while you and Sir Abraham are fighting , papa will lose his preferment ; and what will you do then with him and Eleanor on your hands ? besides , who 's to pay Sir Abraham ? I suppose he wo n't take the case up for nothing ? "
32062	32073	32075	32076	Mr Chadwick	114	" We 've got Sir Abraham 's opinion at last , "
32083	32090	32092	32093	the archdeacon	381	" Well , well , well ! "
32096	32107	32109	32110	the other	757	" Oh , it 's as long as my arm , "
32112	32128	32130	32130	he	757	" it ca n't be told in a word , but you can read it ; "
32172	32177	32179	32179	Chadwick	114	" The upshot is , "
32181	32255	32179	32179	Chadwick	114	" that there 's a screw loose in their case , and we had better do nothing . They are proceeding against Mr Harding and myself , and Sir Abraham holds that , under the wording of the will , and subsequent arrangements legally sanctioned , Mr Harding and I are only paid servants . The defendants should have been either the Corporation of Barchester , or possibly the chapter of your father . "
32256	32261	32263	32264	the archdeacon	381	" W - hoo ! "
32279	32279	32277	32277	he	126	"
32280	32362	32179	32179	Chadwick	114	" That 's Sir Abraham 's opinion ; but any scent almost would be a wrong scent . Sir Abraham thinks that if they 'd taken the corporation , or the chapter , we could have baffled them . The bishop , he thinks , would be the surest shot ; but even there we could plead that the bishop is only a visitor , and that he has never made himself a consenting party to the performance of other duties . "
32363	32369	32371	32372	the archdeacon	381	" That 's quite clear , "
32374	32380	32382	32383	the other	757	" Not quite so clear , "
32385	32503	32382	32383	the other	757	" You see the will says , ' My lord , the bishop , being graciously pleased to see that due justice be done . ' Now , it may be a question whether , in accepting and administering the patronage , your father has not accepted also the other duties assigned . It is doubtful , however ; but even if they hit that nail , and they are far off from that yet , the point is so nice , as Sir Abraham says , that you would force them into fifteen thousand pounds ' cost before they could bring it to an issue ! and where 's that sum of money to come from ? "
32623	32645	32647	32647	he	381	" That 's excellent , Chadwick ; that 's excellent ! I told you Sir Abraham was the man for us ; "
32664	32677	32647	32647	he	381	" Do n't you let that be seen , though , archdeacon . "
32678	32687	32689	32690	the doctor	610	" Who ? I ! not for worlds , "
32692	32702	32647	32647	he	381	" People will talk , you know , archdeacon . "
32703	32710	32712	32713	the doctor	610	" Of course , of course , "
32715	32734	32647	32647	he	381	" Because , if that gets abroad , it would teach them how to fight their own battle . "
32735	32739	32741	32742	the doctor	610	" Quite true , "
32744	32761	32647	32647	he	381	" No one here in Barchester ought to see that but you and I , archdeacon . "
32762	32772	32774	32775	the archdeacon	381	" No , no , certainly no one else , "
32785	32791	32774	32775	the archdeacon	381	" no one else shall . "
32792	32805	32807	32808	Mr Chadwick	114	" Mrs Grantly is very interested in the matter , I know , "
33004	33007	33009	33010	Mr Chadwick	114	" But , "
33012	33043	33009	33010	Mr Chadwick	114	" we must , of course , tell your father and Mr Harding so much of Sir Abraham 's opinion as will satisfy them that the matter is doing well . "
33044	33054	33056	33057	the doctor	610	" Oh , certainly , yes , of course , "
33059	33152	33009	33010	Mr Chadwick	114	" You had better let them know that Sir Abraham is of opinion that there is no case at any rate against Mr Harding ; and that as the action is worded at present , it must fall to the ground ; they must be nonsuited , if they carry it on ; you had better tell Mr Harding , that Sir Abraham is clearly of opinion that he is only a servant , and as such not liable ; or if you like it , I 'll see Mr Harding myself . "
33153	33206	33208	33208	he	1607	" Oh , I must see him to - morrow , and my father too , and I 'll explain to them exactly so much ; you wo n't go before lunch , Mr Chadwick : well , if you will , you must , for I know your time is precious ; "
34117	34127	34129	34130	the archdeacon	381	" Sir Abraham 's opinion has come at last , "
34148	34154	34156	34157	the bishop	254	" It is quite favourable , "
34165	34171	34156	34157	the bishop	254	" I am so glad . "
34190	34193	34195	34196	the archdeacon	381	" Yes , "
34198	34263	34195	34196	the archdeacon	381	" Sir Abraham has given most minute attention to the case ; indeed , I knew he would ; most minute attention ; and his opinion is , and as to his opinion on such a subject being correct , no one who knows Sir Abraham 's character can doubt , his opinion is , that they hav'n't got a leg to stand on . "
34264	34271	34172	34173	Mr Harding	153	" But as how , archdeacon ? "
34272	34338	34195	34196	the archdeacon	381	" Why , in the first place : but you 're no lawyer , warden , and I doubt you wo n't understand it ; the gist of the matter is this : under Hiram 's will two paid guardians have been selected for the hospital ; the law will say two paid servants , and you and I wo n't quarrel with the name . "
34339	34354	34356	34357	Mr Harding	153	" At any rate I will not if I am one of the servants , "
34359	34365	34356	34357	Mr Harding	153	" A rose , you know "
34366	34371	34373	34374	the archdeacon	381	" Yes , yes , "
34384	34465	34373	34374	the archdeacon	381	" Well , two paid servants , we 'll say ; one to look after the men , and the other to look after the money . You and Chadwick are these two servants , and whether either of you be paid too much , or too little , more or less in fact than the founder willed , it 's as clear as daylight that no one can fall foul of either of you for receiving an allotted stipend . "
34466	34472	34474	34475	the bishop	254	" That does seem clear , "
34502	34506	34508	34508	he	254	" Quite clear , "
34510	34577	34508	34508	he	254	" and very satisfactory . In point of fact , it being necessary to select such servants for the use of the hospital , the pay to be given to them must depend on the rate of pay for such services , according to their market value at the period in question ; and those who manage the hospital must be the only judges of this . "
34578	34586	34588	34589	the warden	313	" And who does manage the hospital ? "
34591	34635	34588	34589	the warden	313	" Oh , let them find that out ; that 's another question : the action is brought against you and Chadwick ; that 's your defence , and a perfect and full defence it is . Now that I think very satisfactory . "
34636	34639	34641	34642	the bishop	254	" Well , "
34665	34669	34671	34672	the archdeacon	381	" And conclusive , "
34674	34703	34671	34672	the archdeacon	381	" if they press it to a jury , which they wo n't do , no twelve men in England will take five minutes to decide against them . "
34704	34709	34711	34712	Mr Harding	153	" But according to that "
34714	34762	34711	34712	Mr Harding	153	" I might as well have sixteen hundred a year as eight , if the managers choose to allot it to me ; and as I am one of the managers , if not the chief manager , myself , that can hardly be a just arrangement . "
34763	34841	34671	34672	the archdeacon	381	" Oh , well ; all that 's nothing to the question . The question is , whether this intruding fellow , and a lot of cheating attorneys and pestilent dissenters , are to interfere with an arrangement which everyone knows is essentially just and serviceable to the church . Pray do n't let us be splitting hairs , and that amongst ourselves , or there 'll never be an end of the cause or the cost . "
34938	34947	34935	34935	he	349	" Did you see the opinion , archdeacon ? "
35042	35051	35053	35054	the warden	313	" I should like to see the opinion , "
35056	35065	35053	35054	the warden	313	" that is , a copy of it . "
35066	35114	35053	35054	the warden	313	" Well , I suppose you can if you make a point of it ; but I do n't see the use myself ; of course it is essential that the purport of it should not be known , and it is therefore unadvisable to multiply copies . "
35115	35123	35125	35126	the warden	313	" Why should it not be known ? "
35128	35138	35140	35141	the archdeacon	381	" What a question for a man to ask ! "
35153	35225	35145	35145	his	381	" but it is like you : a child is not more innocent than you are in matters of business . Ca n't you see that if we tell them that no action will lie against you , but that one may possibly lie against some other person or persons , that we shall be putting weapons into their hands , and be teaching them how to cut our own throats ? "
35241	35251	35253	35254	the archdeacon	381	" The only thing we have now to do , "
35256	35277	35253	35254	the archdeacon	381	" is to remain quiet , hold our peace , and let them play their own game as they please . "
35278	35287	35289	35290	the warden	313	" We are not to make known then , "
35292	35321	35289	35290	the warden	313	" that we have consulted the attorney - general , and that we are advised by him that the founder 's will is fully and fairly carried out . "
35322	35328	35330	35331	the archdeacon	381	" God bless my soul ! "
35333	35393	35330	35331	the archdeacon	381	" how odd it is that you will not see that all we are to do is to do nothing : why should we say anything about the founder 's will ? We are in possession ; and we know that they are not in a position to put us out ; surely that is enough for the present . "
35442	35447	35449	35450	the warden	313	" And The Jupiter ? "
35455	35461	35463	35464	the other	757	" Oh ! The Jupiter , "
35466	35506	35508	35509	the archdeacon	381	" The Jupiter can break no bones . You must bear with that ; there is much , of course , which it is our bounden duty to bear ; it can not be all roses for us here , "
35514	35543	35508	35509	the archdeacon	381	" besides , the matter is too trivial , of too little general interest to be mentioned again in The Jupiter , unless we stir up the subject . "
35870	35877	35879	35879	he	313	" If it can be proved , "
35883	36013	35879	35879	he	313	" that I have a just and honest right to this , as God well knows I always deemed I had ; if this salary or stipend be really my due , I am not less anxious than another to retain it . I have the well - being of my child to look to . I am too old to miss without some pain the comforts to which I have been used ; and I am , as others are , anxious to prove to the world that I have been right , and to uphold the place I have held ; but I can not do it at such a cost as this . I can not bear this . Could you tell me to do so ? "
36055	36085	36042	36042	he	254	" Could you tell me to sit there at ease , indifferent , and satisfied , while such things as these are said loudly of me in the world ? "
36109	36167	36104	36104	he	254	" No , no , you shall be asked to do nothing that is painful ; you shall do just what your heart tells you to be right ; you shall do whatever you think best yourself . Theophilus , do n't advise him , pray do n't advise the warden to do anything which is painful . "
36202	36208	36209	36209	he	381	" Why , my lord , "
36223	36227	36219	36219	he	381	" my lord , "
36247	36305	36238	36238	he	1706	" Why , my lord , there are two ways of giving advice : there is advice that may be good for the present day ; and there is advice that may be good for days to come : now I can not bring myself to give the former , if it be incompatible with the other . "
36306	36317	36319	36320	the bishop	254	" No , no , no , I suppose not , "
36378	36686	36360	36361	the archdeacon	381	" It is not to be supposed but that much pain will spring out of this unnecessarily raised question . We must all have foreseen that , and the matter has in no wise gone on worse than we expected ; but it will be weak , yes , and wicked also , to abandon the cause and own ourselves wrong , because the inquiry is painful . It is not only ourselves we have to look to ; to a certain extent the interest of the church is in our keeping . Should it be found that one after another of those who hold preferment abandoned it whenever it might be attacked , is it not plain that such attacks would be renewed till nothing was left us ? and , that if so deserted , the Church of England must fall to the ground altogether ? If this be true of many , it is true of one . Were you , accused as you now are , to throw up the wardenship , and to relinquish the preferment which is your property , with the vain object of proving yourself disinterested , you would fail in that object , you would inflict a desperate blow on your brother clergymen , you would encourage every cantankerous dissenter in England to make a similar charge against some source of clerical revenue , and you would do your best to dishearten those who are most anxious to defend you and uphold your position . I can fancy nothing more weak , or more wrong . It is not that you think that there is any justice in these charges , or that you doubt your own right to the wardenship : you are convinced of your own honesty , and yet would yield to them through cowardice . "
36687	36690	36692	36693	the bishop	254	" Cowardice ! "
36711	37015	36360	36361	the archdeacon	381	" Well ; would it not be cowardice ? Would he not do so because he is afraid to endure the evil things which will be falsely spoken of him ? Would that not be cowardice ? And now let us see the extent of the evil which you dread . The Jupiter publishes an article which a great many , no doubt , will read ; but of those who understand the subject how many will believe The Jupiter ? Everyone knows what its object is : it has taken up the case against Lord Guildford and against the Dean of Rochester , and that against half a dozen bishops ; and does not everyone know that it would take up any case of the kind , right or wrong , false or true , with known justice or known injustice , if by doing so it could further its own views ? Does not all the world know this of The Jupiter ? Who that really knows you will think the worse of you for what The Jupiter says ? And why care for those who do not know you ? I will say nothing of your own comfort , but I do say that you could not be justified in throwing up , in a fit of passion , for such it would be , the only maintenance that Eleanor has ; and if you did so , if you really did vacate the wardenship , and submit to ruin , what would that profit you ? If you have no future right to the income , you have had no past right to it ; and the very fact of your abandoning your position would create a demand for repayment of that which you have already received and spent . "
37067	37263	37052	37053	the archdeacon	381	" But let us suppose the office to be left vacant , and that your own troubles concerning it were over ; would that satisfy you ? Are your only aspirations in the matter confined to yourself and family ? I know they are not . I know you are as anxious as any of us for the church to which we belong ; and what a grievous blow would such an act of apostasy give her ! You owe it to the church of which you are a member and a minister , to bear with this affliction , however severe it may be : you owe it to my father , who instituted you , to support his rights : you owe it to those who preceded you to assert the legality of their position ; you owe it to those who are to come after you , to maintain uninjured for them that which you received uninjured from others ; and you owe to us all the unflinching assistance of perfect brotherhood in this matter , so that upholding one another we may support our great cause without blushing and without disgrace . "
37635	37643	37645	37646	the archdeacon	381	" I hope you agree with me , "
37655	37666	37645	37646	the archdeacon	381	" my lord , I hope you agree with me . "
37676	37687	37690	37692	the merciless tyrant	1732	" My lord , I hope you agree with me , "
37694	37701	37703	37706	the poor old man	1733	" Yes , I suppose so , "
37710	37716	37703	37706	the poor old man	1733	" And you , warden ? "
37743	37778	37703	37706	the poor old man	1733	" Do not press me for an answer just at present ; I will do nothing lightly in the matter , and of whatever I do I will give you and the bishop notice . "
38454	38463	38464	38464	he	153	" Leave me , Eleanor , my dear , "
38467	38484	38464	38464	he	153	" leave me , my darling , for a few minutes , for I am busy . "
38554	38559	38561	38561	he	153	" Well , Bunce , "
38572	38582	38561	38561	he	153	" what is it ? do you want me ? "
38583	38594	38596	38598	the old bedesman	1760	" I was only coming to ask after your reverence , "
38604	38614	38615	38615	he	1760	" and to inquire about the news from London , "
38636	38645	38647	38647	Bunce	141	" Attorney Finney has been there this morning , "
38649	38699	38701	38702	the man	1762	" and by his looks I guess he is not so well pleased as he once was , and it has got abroad somehow that the archdeacon has had down great news from London , and Handy and Moody are both as black as devils . And I hope , "
38711	38737	38701	38702	the man	1762	" that things are looking up , and that there 'll be an end soon to all this stuff which bothers your reverence so sorely . "
38738	38749	38775	38775	his	153	" Well , I wish there may be , Bunce . "
38750	38759	38761	38763	the old man	1763	" But about the news , your reverence ? "
38790	38808	38810	38810	he	191	" If there was anything to cheer you , I should be so glad to know it , "
38842	38846	38848	38848	he	191	" My friend , "
38850	38873	38848	38848	he	191	" my dear old friend , there is nothing ; there is no news to cheer me ; God 's will be done "
38892	38900	38902	38903	the other	757	" Then God 's will be done , "
38906	38935	38902	38903	the other	757	" but they told me that there was good news from London , and I came to wish your reverence joy ; but God 's will be done ; "
39131	39142	39144	39144	Eleanor	110	" Would you like Bunce to come in , papa ? "
39159	39196	39144	39144	Eleanor	110	" No , my dear , thank you , not to - day ; but are not you going out , Eleanor , this lovely afternoon ? do n't stay in for me , my dear . "
39197	39207	39144	39144	Eleanor	110	" I thought you seemed so sad , papa . "
39208	39211	39213	39213	he	1763	" Sad , "
39217	39261	39213	39213	he	1763	" well , people must all have their share of sadness here ; I am not more exempt than another : but kiss me , dearest , and go now ; I will , if possible , be more sociable when you return . "
40077	40089	40068	40068	her	110	" Papa , wo n't you tell me what it is ? "
40090	40098	40068	40068	her	110	" What what is , my dear ? "
40099	40115	40068	40068	her	110	" This new sorrow that torments you ; I know you are unhappy , papa . "
40116	40136	40138	40138	he	313	" New sorrow ! it 's no new sorrow , my dear ; we have all our cares sometimes ; "
40150	40169	40138	40138	he	313	" but I should n't be so dull a companion ; come , we 'll have some music . "
40170	40185	40187	40187	she	1815	" No , papa , not tonight , it would only trouble you tonight ; "
40213	40249	40210	40210	she	1815	" Papa , I will not leave you till you talk to me ; oh , if you only knew how much good it would do to you , to tell me of it all . "
40294	40366	40367	40368	Mr Harding	153	" Oh , papa , do tell me what it is ; I know it is about the hospital , and what they are doing up in London , and what that cruel newspaper has said ; but if there be such cause for sorrow , let us be sorrowful together ; we are all in all to each other now : dear , dear papa , do speak to me . "
40434	40439	40440	40440	he	153	" My own child , "
40453	40498	40440	40440	he	153	" my own , own child , why should you too be unhappy before it is necessary ? It may come to that , that we must leave this place , but till that time comes , why should your young days be clouded ? "
40499	40558	40569	40569	she	110	" And is that all , papa ? If that be all , let us leave it , and have light hearts elsewhere : if that be all , let us go . Oh , papa , you and I could be happy if we had only bread to eat , so long as our hearts were light . "
40770	40777	40778	40778	she	110	" Give it up , papa , "
40800	40807	40778	40778	she	110	" give it up , papa . "
40890	40895	40898	40898	he	288	" Give it up ! "
40914	40923	40924	40924	she	110	" Papa , do n't doubt about it , "
40942	41066	40924	40924	she	110	" is it on my account that you would stay here ? Do you think that I can not be happy without a pony - carriage and a fine drawing - room ? Papa , I never can be happy here , as long as there is a question as to your honour in staying here ; but I could be gay as the day is long in the smallest tiny little cottage , if I could see you come in and go out with a light heart . Oh ! papa , your face tells so much ; though you wo n't speak to me with your voice , I know how it is with you every time I look at you . "
41492	41498	41499	41499	she	1840	" had loved him once , "
41502	41564	41499	41499	she	1840	" but she would not , could not do so now no , even had her troth been plighted to him , she would have taken it back again ; had she sworn to love him as his wife , she would have discarded him , and not felt herself forsworn , when he proved himself the enemy of her father . "
42602	42610	42612	42612	Mary	162	" John has come back so suddenly , "
42619	42627	42612	42612	Mary	162	" he has been travelling all night . "
42628	42639	42641	42641	Eleanor	110	" Then I 'll come up again some other time , "
42653	42668	42670	42671	the other	757	" He 's out now , and will be for the next two hours , "
42673	42697	42670	42671	the other	757	" he 's with that horrid Finney ; he only came to see him , and he returns by the mail train tonight . "
42792	42795	42796	42796	she	110	" Mary , "
42799	42810	42796	42796	she	110	" I must see your brother before he goes back . "
42811	42818	42820	42821	the other	757	" Oh yes , of course , "
42823	42834	42836	42836	she	757	" I know he 'll be delighted to see you ; "
42986	43009	43011	43011	she	162	" Mary , I must see your brother , now , to - day , and beg from him a great favour ; "
43068	43073	43074	43074	she	162	" But , Mary , "
43077	43131	43134	43134	she	162	" you must now , you know , cease any joking about me and Mr Bold ; you must now say no more about that ; I am not ashamed to beg this favour from your brother , but when I have done so , there can never be anything further between us ; "
43243	43262	43232	43232	his	125	" Now having settled that , let us be man and wife , and all will end happily ! "
43375	43388	43390	43390	Mary	162	" But I am sure you love him ; do n't you ? "
43392	43407	43390	43390	Mary	162	" and I am sure he loves you better than anything in the world . "
43463	43470	43456	43456	herself	110	" Mary , this is nonsense . "
43471	43478	43480	43480	Mary	162	" But you do love him , "
43505	43527	43495	43495	her	162	" You do love him with all your heart , you know you do ; I defy you to deny it . "
43528	43530	43532	43532	Eleanor	110	" I "
43732	43739	43741	43741	she	110	" Tell him I am here , "
43743	43760	43741	43741	she	110	" and coming in ; and mind , whatever you do , do n't leave us . "
44484	44492	44494	44494	Eleanor	110	" My father is not very well , "
44527	44589	44505	44505	he	125	" I especially want to speak to you about my father , Mr Bold ; indeed , I am now here on purpose to do so . Papa is very unhappy , very unhappy indeed , about this affair of the hospital : you would pity him , Mr Bold , if you could see how wretched it has made him . "
44590	44596	44496	44497	John Bold	125	" Oh , Miss Harding ! "
44597	44677	44505	44505	he	125	" Indeed you would ; anyone would pity him ; but a friend , an old friend as you are , indeed you would . He is an altered man ; his cheerfulness has all gone , and his sweet temper , and his kind happy tone of voice ; you would hardly know him if you saw him , Mr Bold , he is so much altered ; and and if this goes on , he will die . "
44707	44736	44694	44694	she	110	" He will break his heart , and die . I am sure , Mr Bold , it was not you who wrote those cruel things in the newspaper "
44760	44847	44757	44758	Tom Towers	193	" No , I am sure it was not ; and papa has not for a moment thought so ; you would not be so cruel ; but it has nearly killed him . Papa can not bear to think that people should so speak of him , and that everybody should hear him so spoken of : they have called him avaricious , and dishonest , and they say he is robbing the old men , and taking the money of the hospital for nothing . "
44848	44859	44949	44949	sister	1212	" I have never said so , Miss Harding . I "
44860	44863	44865	44865	Eleanor	110	" No , "
44884	44942	44871	44871	she	110	" no , I am sure you have not ; but others have said so ; and if this goes on , if such things are written again , it will kill papa . Oh ! Mr Bold , if you only knew the state he is in ! Now papa does not care much about money . "
44974	45082	45095	45095	she	110	" Oh ! it 's so kind of you to say so , Mary , and of you too , Mr Bold . I could n't bear that people should think unjustly of papa . Do you know he would give up the hospital altogether , only he can not . The archdeacon says it would be cowardly , and that he would be deserting his order , and injuring the church . Whatever may happen , papa will not do that : he would leave the place to - morrow willingly , and give up his house , and the income and all , if the archdeacon "
45088	45093	45083	45083	Eleanor	110	" would let him , "
45115	45125	45113	45113	she	110	" Oh , I do so wish he would . "
45126	45140	45142	45142	Bold	126	" No one who knows Mr Harding personally accuses him for a moment , "
45144	45161	45163	45163	Eleanor	110	" It is he that has to bear the punishment ; it is he that suffers , "
45165	45202	45163	45163	Eleanor	110	" and what for ? what has he done wrong ? how has he deserved this persecution ? he that never had an unkind thought in his life , he that never said an unkind word ! "
45245	45253	45255	45255	Eleanor	110	" Then why should he be persecuted ? "
45279	45304	45306	45306	she	110	" why should he be singled out for scorn and disgrace ? why should he be made so wretched ? Oh ! Mr Bold , "
45321	45343	45306	45306	she	110	" oh ! Mr Bold , why did you begin all this ? You , whom we all so so valued ! "
45476	45480	45482	45482	she	110	" Mr Bold , "
45484	45497	45482	45482	she	110	" I have come here to implore you to abandon this proceeding . "
45511	45611	45498	45498	He	126	" To implore you to abandon it , to implore you to spare my father , to spare either his life or his reason , for one or the other will pay the forfeit if this goes on . I know how much I am asking , and how little right I have to ask anything ; but I think you will listen to me as it is for my father . Oh , Mr Bold , pray , pray do this for us ; pray do not drive to distraction a man who has loved you so well . "
45705	45718	45720	45721	his sister	532	" Surely , surely , John , you can not refuse her , "
45723	45731	45733	45733	he	1973	" I would give her my soul , "
45735	45742	45733	45733	he	1973	" if it would serve her . "
45743	45749	45751	45751	Eleanor	110	" Oh , Mr Bold , "
45753	45781	45751	45751	Eleanor	110	" do not speak so ; I ask nothing for myself ; and what I ask for my father , it can not harm you to grant . "
45782	45796	45798	45798	Bold	126	" I would give her my soul , if it would serve her , "
45805	45876	45798	45798	Bold	126	" everything I have is hers , if she will accept it ; my house , my heart , my all ; every hope of my breast is centred in her ; her smiles are sweeter to me than the sun , and when I see her in sorrow as she now is , every nerve in my body suffers . No man can love better than I love her . "
45877	45884	45886	45886	Eleanor	110	" No , no , no , "
45888	45913	45886	45886	Eleanor	110	" there can be no talk of love between us . Will you protect my father from the evil you have brought upon him ? "
45914	45933	45798	45798	Bold	126	" Oh , Eleanor , I will do anything ; let me tell you how I love you ! "
45934	45941	45942	45942	she	110	" No , no , no ! "
45946	45976	45986	45986	she	110	" This is unmanly of you , Mr Bold . Will you , will you , will you leave my father to die in peace in his quiet home ? "
45996	46040	45986	45986	she	110	" I will not leave you till you promise me ; I 'll cling to you in the street ; I 'll kneel to you before all the people . You shall promise me this , you shall promise me this , you shall "
46058	46068	46070	46070	Mary	162	" Speak to her , John ; answer her , "
46082	46093	46070	46070	Mary	162	" you can not have the cruelty to refuse her . "
46094	46101	46103	46103	Eleanor	110	" Promise me , promise me , "
46136	46136	46130	46130	I	0	"
46212	46216	46218	46218	she	110	" Promise me , "
46220	46232	46218	46218	she	110	" I will not leave you till you have promised me . "
46233	46237	46239	46239	he	1976	" I will , "
46243	46255	46239	46239	he	1976	" I do all I can do , I will do . "
46256	46268	46270	46270	Eleanor	110	" Then may God Almighty bless you for ever and ever ! "
46615	46632	46605	46605	she	110	" Mr Bold and I are strangers , Mary , and are always to remain so ! "
46925	46932	46934	46934	Bold	126	" Are you going so soon ? "
46959	46963	46965	46965	she	110	" Oh yes ! "
46967	46985	46965	46965	she	110	" I am so much obliged to you ; papa will feel this to be so kind . "
46997	47016	46986	46986	She	110	" Of course I must tell him , and I will say that you will see the archdeacon . "
47017	47028	47030	47030	Bold	126	" But may I not say one word for myself ? "
47032	47042	47044	47044	Mary	162	" I 'll fetch you your bonnet , Eleanor , "
47054	47059	47061	47061	she	162	" Mary , Mary , "
47072	47084	47061	47061	she	162	" do n't go , I 'll get my bonnet myself . "
47145	47152	47137	47137	Eleanor	110	" No , no , no , "
47189	47196	47175	47175	her	110	" No , no , no 's "
47519	47529	47530	47530	she	110	" I did think I could have trusted Mary , "
47539	47559	47530	47530	she	110	" Oh that she should have dared to keep me in the room when I tried to get out ! "
48036	48047	48049	48049	Henry	121	" Do you want to see anybody here , sir ? "
48104	48107	48109	48110	Charles James	179	" Henry , "
48121	48160	48109	48110	Charles James	179	" Mr Bold of course would not have come without wanting to see someone ; if Mr Bold has a proper ground for wanting to see some person here , of course he has a right to come . "
48177	48183	48185	48185	he	121	" Oh , Mr Bold , "
48187	48224	48226	48226	he	121	" papa , I 'm sure , will be glad to see you ; I suppose you want to see papa . Shall I hold your horse for you ? Oh what a very pretty horse ! "
48237	48281	48226	48226	he	121	" Papa has heard such good news about the old hospital to - day . We know you 'll be glad to hear it , because you 're such a friend of grandpapa Harding , and so much in love with Aunt Nelly ! "
48282	48289	48291	48291	Bold	126	" How d'ye do , lads ? "
48295	48308	48291	48291	Bold	126	" I want to see your father if he 's at home . "
48309	48312	48314	48314	Henry	121	" Lads ! "
48336	48352	48334	48334	Bold	126	" lads , indeed ! if we 're lads , what does he call himself ? "
49036	49042	49044	49044	he	126	" Well , Mr Bold , "
49046	49079	49044	49044	he	126	" well , what can I do for you ? Very happy , I can assure you , to do anything for such a friend of my father - in - law . "
49080	49092	49136	49136	he	112	" I hope you 'll excuse my calling , Dr Grantly . "
49093	49098	49100	49101	the archdeacon	381	" Certainly , certainly , "
49103	49128	49100	49101	the archdeacon	381	" I can assure you , no apology is necessary from Mr Bold ; only let me know what I can do for him . "
49206	49233	49178	49179	the archdeacon	381	" And so , Mr Bold , I 'm to understand , I believe , that you are desirous of abandoning this attack upon Mr Harding . "
49234	49250	49178	49179	the archdeacon	381	" Oh , Dr Grantly , there has been no attack , I can assure you "
49251	49324	49178	49179	the archdeacon	381	" Well , well , we wo n't quarrel about words ; I should call it an attack ; most men would so call an endeavour to take away from a man every shilling of income that he has to live upon ; but it sha'n't be an attack , if you do n't like it ; you wish to abandon this this little game of backgammon you 've begun to play . "
49325	49341	49178	49179	the archdeacon	381	" I intend to put an end to the legal proceedings which I have commenced . "
49342	49346	49348	49349	the archdeacon	381	" I understand , "
49351	49392	49348	49349	the archdeacon	381	" You 've already had enough of it ; well , I ca n't say that I am surprised ; carrying on a losing lawsuit where one has nothing to gain , but everything to pay , is not pleasant . "
49401	49407	49409	49409	he	126	" You misinterpret my motives , "
49411	49449	49409	49409	he	126	" but , however , that is of little consequence . I did not come to trouble you with my motives , but to tell you a matter of fact . Good - morning , Dr Grantly . "
49450	49457	49459	49460	the other	757	" One moment , one moment , "
49462	49561	49459	49460	the other	757	" I do n't exactly appreciate the taste which induced you to make any personal communication to me on the subject ; but I dare say I 'm wrong , I dare say your judgment is the better of the two ; but as you have done me the honour , as you have , as it were , forced me into a certain amount of conversation on a subject which had better , perhaps , have been left to our lawyers , you will excuse me if I ask you to hear my reply to your communication . "
49562	49572	49409	49409	he	126	" I am in no hurry , Dr Grantly . "
49573	49615	49617	49617	he	2076	" Well , I am , Mr Bold ; my time is not exactly leisure time , and , therefore , if you please , we 'll go to the point at once : you 're going to abandon this lawsuit ? "
49623	49632	49409	49409	he	126	" Yes , Dr Grantly , I am . "
49633	49792	49409	49409	he	126	" Having exposed a gentleman who was one of your father 's warmest friends to all the ignominy and insolence which the press could heap upon his name , having somewhat ostentatiously declared that it was your duty as a man of high public virtue to protect those poor old fools whom you have humbugged there at the hospital , you now find that the game costs more than it 's worth , and so you make up your mind to have done with it . A prudent resolution , Mr Bold ; but it is a pity you should have been so long coming to it . Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over ? that we may find it necessary to punish the injury you have done to us ? Are you aware , sir , that we have gone to enormous expense to resist this iniquitous attempt of yours ? "
49816	49854	49409	49409	he	126	" We have found it necessary to employ the best advice that money could procure . Are you aware , sir , what may be the probable cost of securing the services of the attorney - general ? "
49855	49864	49409	49409	he	126	" Not in the least , Dr Grantly . "
49865	49949	49409	49409	he	126	" I dare say not , sir . When you recklessly put this affair into the hands of your friend Mr Finney , whose six - and - eightpences and thirteen - and - fourpences may , probably , not amount to a large sum , you were indifferent as to the cost and suffering which such a proceeding might entail on others ; but are you aware , sir , that these crushing costs must now come out of your own pocket ? "
49950	49974	49409	49409	he	126	" Any demand of such a nature which Mr Harding 's lawyer may have to make will doubtless be made to my lawyer . "
49975	50045	49409	49409	he	126	" ' Mr Harding 's lawyer and my lawyer ! ' Did you come here merely to refer me to the lawyers ? Upon my word I think the honour of your visit might have been spared ! And now , sir , I 'll tell you what my opinion is : my opinion is , that we shall not allow you to withdraw this matter from the courts . "
50046	50061	49409	49409	he	126	" You can do as you please , Dr Grantly ; good - morning . "
50062	50069	50071	50072	the archdeacon	381	" Hear me out , sir , "
50074	50120	50071	50072	the archdeacon	381	" I have here in my hands the last opinion given in this matter by Sir Abraham Haphazard . I dare say you have already heard of this ; I dare say it has had something to do with your visit here to - day . "
50121	50134	49409	49409	he	126	" I know nothing whatever of Sir Abraham Haphazard or his opinion . "
50135	50209	50211	50211	he	2078	" Be that as it may , here it is ; he declares most explicitly that under no phasis of the affair whatever have you a leg to stand upon ; that Mr Harding is as safe in his hospital as I am here in my rectory ; that a more futile attempt to destroy a man was never made , than this which you have made to ruin Mr Harding . Here , "
50219	50311	50211	50211	he	2078	" I have this opinion from the very first lawyer in the land ; and under these circumstances you expect me to make you a low bow for your kind offer to release Mr Harding from the toils of your net ! Sir , your net is not strong enough to hold him ; sir , your net has fallen to pieces , and you knew that well enough before I told you ; and now , sir , I 'll wish you good - morning , for I 'm busy . "
50358	50362	50363	50363	he	126	" Dr Grantly , "
50366	50377	50379	50380	the archdeacon	381	" I have nothing further to say or to hear , "
50382	50394	50379	50380	the archdeacon	381	" I 'll do myself the honour to order your horse . "
50401	50415	50396	50396	he	381	" I came here , Dr Grantly , with the warmest , kindest feelings "
50416	50428	50396	50396	he	381	" Oh , of course you did ; nobody doubts it . "
50429	50446	50396	50396	he	381	" With the kindest feelings ; and they have been most grossly outraged by your treatment . "
50447	50477	50396	50396	he	381	" Of course they have ; I have not chosen to see my father - in - law ruined ; what an outrage that has been to your feelings ! "
50478	50500	50396	50396	he	381	" The time will come , Dr Grantly , when you will understand why I called upon you to - day . "
50501	50531	50533	50534	the doctor	610	" No doubt , no doubt . Is Mr Bold 's horse there ? That 's right ; open the front door . Good - morning , Mr Bold ; "
50593	50627	50590	50591	little Sammy	180	" Good - bye , Mr Bold ; I hope we may have the pleasure of seeing you again before long ; I am sure papa will always be glad to see you . "
50857	50864	50866	50866	he	125	" If there be a devil , "
50868	50881	50866	50866	he	125	" a real devil here on earth , it is Dr Grantly . "
51027	51037	51038	51038	he	288	" I am going to London , my dear , "
51047	51052	51043	51043	he	288	" London , papa ! "
51053	51084	51043	51043	he	288	" Yes , my dear , to London ; I will have this matter settled some way ; there are some things , Eleanor , which I can not bear . "
51085	51094	51096	51096	she	110	" Oh , papa , what is it ? "
51107	51127	51096	51096	she	110	" I had such good news for you , and now you make me fear I am too late . "
51288	51301	51303	51303	he	313	" Mr Bold can act as he thinks proper , my love , "
51305	51333	51303	51303	he	313	" if Mr Bold thinks he has been wrong , of course he will discontinue what he is doing ; but that can not change my purpose . "
51334	51339	51340	51340	she	110	" Oh , papa ! "
51349	51368	51340	51340	she	110	" I thought you would have been so happy ; I thought all would have been right now . "
51369	51373	51375	51375	he	313	" Mr Bold , "
51377	51403	51375	51375	he	313	" has set great people to work , so great that I doubt they are now beyond his control . Read that , my dear . "
52089	52095	52097	52097	he	288	" Well , my dear , "
52099	52119	52097	52097	he	288	" what do you think of that ; is it worth while to be a warden at that price ? "
52120	52128	52170	52170	he	288	" Oh , papa ; dear papa ! "
52129	52167	52170	52170	he	288	" Mr Bold ca n't un - write that , my dear ; Mr Bold ca n't say that that sha'n't be read by every clergyman at Oxford ; nay , by every gentleman in the land ; "
52189	52200	52201	52201	he	288	" And I 'll tell you what , my dear , "
52218	52239	52201	52201	he	288	" Mr Bold ca n't dispute the truth of every word in that article you have just read nor can I. "
52256	52294	52296	52296	he	288	" Nor can I , Eleanor : that 's the worst of all , or would be so if there were no remedy . I have thought much of all this since we were together last night ; "
52316	52347	52296	52296	he	288	" I have thought much of what the archdeacon has said , and of what this paper says ; and I do believe I have no right to be here . "
52348	52360	52311	52311	he	288	" No right to be warden of the hospital , papa ? "
52361	52421	52296	52296	he	288	" No right to be warden with eight hundred a year ; no right to be warden with such a house as this ; no right to spend in luxury money that was intended for charity . Mr Bold may do as he pleases about his suit , but I hope he will not abandon it for my sake . "
52743	52755	52757	52758	the warden	313	" They shall not put forward this plea on my behalf , "
52760	52836	52757	52758	the warden	313	" Whatever may be the truth of the matter , that at any rate is not true ; and the man who wrote that article is right in saying that such a plea is revolting to an honest mind . I will go up to London , my dear , and see these lawyers myself , and if no better excuse can be made for me than that , I and the hospital will part . "
52837	52844	52757	52758	the warden	313	" But the archdeacon , papa ? "
52845	52872	52874	52874	he	313	" I ca n't help it , my dear ; there are some things which a man can not bear : I can not bear that ; "
52882	52891	52876	52876	his	313	" But will the archdeacon go with you ? "
53117	53124	53126	53126	he	153	" No , I think not , "
53128	53150	53126	53126	he	153	" I think I shall start before the archdeacon could be ready ; I shall go early to - morrow morning . "
53151	53159	53161	53161	Eleanor	110	" That will be best , papa , "
53172	53301	53309	53309	she	110	" Why yes , my love . The fact is , I wish to do all this before the archdeacon can can interfere . There is a great deal of truth in all he says ; he argues very well , and I ca n't always answer him ; but there is an old saying , Nelly : ' Everyone knows where his own shoe pinches ! ' He 'll say that I want moral courage , and strength of character , and power of endurance , and it 's all true ; but I 'm sure I ought not to remain here , if I have nothing better to put forward than a quibble : so , Nelly , we shall have to leave this pretty place . "
53320	53326	53328	53328	he	288	" True , my love , "
53341	53364	53328	53328	he	288	" What good to us is this place or all the money , if we are to be ill - spoken of ? "
53365	53375	53309	53309	she	110	" Oh , papa , I am so glad ! "
53376	53434	53328	53328	he	288	" My darling child ! It did cost me a pang at first , Nelly , to think that you should lose your pretty drawing - room , and your ponies , and your garden : the garden will be the worst of all ; but there is a garden at Crabtree , a very pretty garden . "
53666	53669	53671	53672	the warden	313	" Yes , "
53676	53696	53671	53672	the warden	313	" there is a very pretty garden at Crabtree ; but I shall be sorry to disturb poor Smith . "
53769	53780	53750	53750	She	110	" But we will take the music , my dear . "
53895	53902	53903	53903	he	1817	" a man , my love , "
53908	53923	53903	53903	he	1817	" to whom I firmly believe that I can trust my treasure with safety . "
53924	53932	53903	53903	he	1817	" But what will Dr Grantly say ? "
53933	53953	53903	53903	he	1817	" Well , my dear , it ca n't be helped ; we shall be out at Crabtree then . "

54664	54726	54660	54662	the unbelieving stranger	2242	" Is it from these small , dark , dingy buildings that those infallible laws proceed which cabinets are called upon to obey ; by which bishops are to be guided , lords and commons controlled , judges instructed in law , generals in strategy , admirals in naval tactics , and orange - women in the management of their barrows ? "
54727	54881	54660	54662	the unbelieving stranger	2242	" Yes , my friend from these walls . From here issue the only known infallible bulls for the guidance of British souls and bodies . This little court is the Vatican of England . Here reigns a pope , self - nominated , self - consecrated , ay , and much stranger too , self - believing ! a pope whom , if you can not obey him , I would advise you to disobey as silently as possible ; a pope hitherto afraid of no Luther ; a pope who manages his own inquisition , who punishes unbelievers as no most skilful inquisitor of Spain ever dreamt of doing ; one who can excommunicate thoroughly , fearfully , radically ; put you beyond the pale of men 's charity ; make you odious to your dearest friends , and turn you into a monster to be pointed at by the finger !

58303	58324	58326	58327	Tom Towers	193	" Oh yes , the master of the place ; the man who takes all the money and does nothing , "
58332	58372	58373	58373	Bold	125	" Well , I do n't know about that ; but his conduct in the matter has been so excellent , so little selfish , so open , that I can not proceed in the matter to his detriment . "
58398	58412	58392	58392	he	125	" I think nothing should now be done till the wardenship be vacant . "

58423	58499	58421	58421	Towers	193	" as it certainly would , before anyone heard of the vacancy ; and the same objection would again exist . It 's an old story , that of the vested rights of the incumbent ; but suppose the incumbent has only a vested wrong , and that the poor of the town have a vested right , if they only knew how to get at it : is not that something the case here ? "
58557	58569	58571	58571	Towers	193	" It will cost you a good deal , I fear , "
58573	58578	58580	58580	Bold	125	" A few hundreds , "

58599	58657	58659	58659	he	125	" That 's philosophical . It 's quite refreshing to hear a man talking of his hundreds in so purely indifferent a manner . But I 'm sorry you are giving the matter up . It injures a man to commence a thing of this kind , and not carry it through . Have you seen that ? "

61474	61524	61467	61467	Bold	125	" The Jupiter , you know , has taken the matter up very strongly . Mr Harding has felt what it has said deeply ; and I thought that if I could explain to you that he personally has not been to blame , these articles might be discontinued . "
61579	61584	61586	61586	he	193	" My dear fellow , "
61595	61605	61586	61586	he	193	" I really can not answer for The Jupiter . "
61606	61642	61572	61572	his	125	" But if you saw that these articles were unjust , I think that You would endeavour to put a stop to them . Of course nobody doubts that you could , if you chose . "
61643	61659	61586	61586	he	193	" Nobody and everybody are always very kind , but unfortunately are generally very wrong . "
61660	61667	61669	61669	Bold	125	" Come , come , Towers , "
61692	61736	61683	61683	he	125	" I have no doubt in my own mind but that you wrote the articles yourself , and very well written they were : it will be a great favour if you will in future abstain from any personal allusion to poor Harding . "
61737	61742	61744	61745	Tom Towers	193	" My dear Bold , "
61747	61798	61744	61745	Tom Towers	193	" I have a sincere regard for you . I have known you for many years , and value your friendship ; I hope you will let me explain to you , without offence , that none who are connected with the public press can with propriety listen to interference . "
61799	61802	61804	61804	Bold	125	" Interference ! "
61806	61814	61804	61804	Bold	125	" I do n't want to interfere . "
61815	61888	61744	61745	Tom Towers	193	" Ah , but , my dear fellow , you do ; what else is it ? You think that I am able to keep certain remarks out of a newspaper . Your information is probably incorrect , as most public gossip on such subjects is ; but , at any rate , you think I have such power , and you ask me to use it : now that is interference . "
61889	61900	61804	61804	Bold	125	" Well , if you choose to call it so . "
61901	62069	61744	61745	Tom Towers	193	" And now suppose for a moment that I had this power , and used it as you wish : is n't it clear that it would be a great abuse ? Certain men are employed in writing for the public press ; and if they are induced either to write or to abstain from writing by private motives , surely the public press would soon be of little value . Look at the recognised worth of different newspapers , and see if it does not mainly depend on the assurance which the public feel that such a paper is , or is not , independent . You alluded to The Jupiter : surely you can not but see that the weight of The Jupiter is too great to be moved by any private request , even though it should be made to a much more influential person than myself : you 've only to think of this , and you 'll see that I am right . "

62211	62219	62221	62221	Bold	125	" I know he wrote those articles , "
62225	62383	62223	62223	himself	125	" I know he got his information from me . He was ready enough to take my word for gospel when it suited his own views , and to set Mr Harding up before the public as an impostor on no other testimony than my chance conversation ; but when I offer him real evidence opposed to his own views , he tells me that private motives are detrimental to public justice ! Confound his arrogance ! What is any public question but a conglomeration of private interests ? What is any newspaper article but an expression of the views taken by one side ? Truth ! it takes an age to ascertain the truth of any question ! The idea of Tom Towers talking of public motives and purity of purpose ! Why , it would n't give him a moment 's uneasiness to change his politics to - morrow , if the paper required it . "

65508	65511	65513	65513	he	153	" Waiter , "
65523	65544	65517	65518	the waiter	2729	" If anyone calls for me , I am going to dine out , and shall return about eleven o'clock . "
67717	67721	67690	67691	the archdeacon	381	" Chops and Steaks "
68345	68352	68339	68340	the girl	2904	" Who that old cock was ; "
68624	68704	68613	68613	he	153	" One shilling , sir , thank ye , sir , cigar , sir ? ticket for coffee , sir ; you 'll only have to call the waiter . Up those stairs , if you please , sir . Better take the cigar , sir , you can always give it to a friend , you know . Well , sir , thank ye , sir ; as you are so good , I 'll smoke it myself . "
69428	69439	69441	69442	Sir Abraham	153	" Very sorry to keep you waiting , Mr Warden , "
69449	69488	69441	69442	Sir Abraham	153	" and sorry , too , to name so disagreeable an hour ; but your notice was short , and as you said to - day , I named the very earliest hour that was not disposed of . "
70162	70169	70171	70172	Sir Abraham	153	" And so , Mr Warden , "
70174	70186	70171	70172	Sir Abraham	153	" all our trouble about this lawsuit is at an end . "
70226	70276	70211	70211	his	153	" All over . You need trouble yourself no further about it ; of course they must pay the costs , and the absolute expense to you and Dr Grantly will be trifling , that is , compared with what it might have been if it had been continued . "
70277	70290	70341	70341	he	153	" I fear I do n't quite understand you , Sir Abraham . "
70291	70309	70211	70211	his	153	" Do n't you know that their attorneys have noticed us that they have withdrawn the suit ? "
70397	70442	70377	70377	his	1585	" I know I have no right to trouble you personally with this matter , but as it is of most vital importance to me , as all my happiness is concerned in it , I thought I might venture to seek your advice . "
70477	70540	70377	70377	his	1585	" A spoken word , Sir Abraham , is often of more value than volumes of written advice . The truth is , I am ill - satisfied with this matter as it stands at present . I do see I can not help seeing , that the affairs of the hospital are not arranged according to the will of the founder . "
70541	70569	70665	70666	Sir Abraham	153	" None of such institutions are , Mr Harding , nor can they be ; the altered circumstances in which we live do not admit of it . "
70570	70664	70377	70377	his	1585	" Quite true that is quite true ; but I ca n't see that those altered circumstances give me a right to eight hundred a year . I do n't know whether I ever read John Hiram 's will , but were I to read it now I could not understand it . What I want you , Sir Abraham , to tell me , is this : am I , as warden , legally and distinctly entitled to the proceeds of the property , after the due maintenance of the twelve bedesmen ? "
70745	70752	70754	70757	the attorney - general	1585	" Nay , my dear sir , "
70759	70782	70754	70757	the attorney - general	1585	" there is no further ground for any question ; I do n't see that you have the power of raising it . "
70783	70788	70790	70791	Mr Harding	153	" I can resign , "
70815	70823	70825	70828	the attorney - general	1585	" What ! throw it up altogether ? "
70838	70848	70850	70851	Mr Harding	153	" Did you see those articles in The Jupiter ? "
70913	70920	70922	70922	he	153	" Had n't you better wait , "
70924	70951	70922	70922	he	153	" till Dr Grantly is in town with you ? Would n't it be better to postpone any serious step till you can consult with him ? "
70972	70976	70978	70979	the latter	1434	" Of course , "
70981	70995	70978	70979	the latter	1434	" if you have private means sufficient for your wants , and if this "
70996	71006	71008	71009	the warden	313	" I have n't a sixpence , Sir Abraham , "
71011	71028	70978	70979	the latter	1434	" God bless me ! Why , Mr Harding , how do you mean to live ? "
71142	71220	71135	71136	Sir Abraham	153	" I really think , Mr Harding , you had better wait for the archdeacon . This is a most serious step , one for which , in my opinion , there is not the slightest necessity ; and , as you have done me the honour of asking my advice , I must implore you to do nothing without the approval of your friends . A man is never the best judge of his own position . "
71221	71271	71132	71132	his	153	" A man is the best judge of what he feels himself . I 'd sooner beg my bread till my death than read such another article as those two that have appeared , and feel , as I do , that the writer has truth on his side . "
71272	71286	71135	71136	Sir Abraham	153	" Have you not a daughter , Mr Harding , an unmarried daughter ? "
71287	71291	71293	71293	he	3015	" I have , "
71313	71331	71293	71293	he	3015	" I have , Sir Abraham ; and she and I are completely agreed on this subject . "
71332	71400	71401	71402	The warden	313	" Pray excuse me , Mr Harding , if what I say seems impertinent ; but surely it is you that should be prudent on her behalf . She is young , and does not know the meaning of living on an income of a hundred and sixty pounds a year . On her account give up this idea . Believe me , it is sheer Quixotism . "
71454	71474	71476	71477	the warden	313	" But if this income be not justly mine , what if she and I have both to beg ? "
71502	71513	71497	71498	Sir Abraham	153	" If so , it would be better to beg . "
71514	71525	71476	71477	the warden	313	" My dear sir , nobody now questions its justness . "
71526	71770	71782	71782	he	3019	" Yes , Sir Abraham , one does question it , the most important of all witnesses against me ; I question it myself . My God knows whether or no I love my daughter ; but I would sooner that she and I should both beg , than that she should live in comfort on money which is truly the property of the poor . It may seem strange to you , Sir Abraham , it is strange to myself , that I should have been ten years in that happy home , and not have thought of these things till they were so roughly dinned into my ears . I can not boast of my conscience , when it required the violence of a public newspaper to awaken it ; but , now that it is awake , I must obey it . When I came here , I did not know that the suit was withdrawn by Mr Bold , and my object was to beg you to abandon my defence . As there is no action , there can be no defence ; but it is , at any rate , as well that you should know that from to - morrow I shall cease to be the warden of the hospital . My friends and I differ on this subject , Sir Abraham , and that adds much to my sorrow ; but it can not be helped . "
71940	71954	71967	71968	the warden	313	" You 'll sleep on this , Mr Harding , and to - morrow "
71955	71965	71967	71968	the warden	313	" I have done more than sleep upon it , "
71970	72000	71967	71968	the warden	313	" I have lain awake upon it , and that night after night . I found I could not sleep upon it : now I hope to do so . "
72320	72328	72330	72330	his	153	" Dr Grantly is here , sir , "
72339	72359	72330	72330	his	153	" and Mrs Grantly . They have a sitting - room above , and are waiting up for you . "
72422	72434	72419	72419	he	313	" Oh , indeed ! I 'll go upstairs at once ; "
72550	72561	72563	72564	the lady	609	" Papa , I thought you were never coming back , "
72566	72572	72563	72564	the lady	609	" it 's twelve o'clock . "
72573	72579	72581	72582	the warden	313	" Yes , my dear , "
72584	72619	72581	72582	the warden	313	" The attorney - general named ten for my meeting ; to be sure ten is late , but what could I do , you know ? Great men will have their own way . "
72642	72654	72656	72657	the archdeacon	381	" And you have absolutely been with the attorney - general ? "
72666	72673	72675	72676	the archdeacon	381	" Good heavens , how unfortunate ! "
72699	72726	72678	72678	his	381	" What will Sir Abraham think of it ? Did you not know that it is not customary for clients to go direct to their counsel ? "
72727	72732	72734	72735	the warden	313	" Is n't it ? "
72739	72764	72734	72735	the warden	313	" Well , at any rate , I 've done it now . Sir Abraham did n't seem to think it so very strange . "
72781	72794	72796	72797	the lady	609	" But , papa , what did you say to Sir Abraham ? "
72799	72838	72845	72846	the archdeacon	381	" I asked him , my dear , to explain John Hiram 's will to me . He could n't explain it in the only way which would have satisfied me , and so I resigned the wardenship . "
72839	72843	72845	72846	the archdeacon	381	" Resigned it ! "
72883	72890	72845	72846	the archdeacon	381	" Resigned it ! Good heavens ! "
72907	72928	73011	73015	the reverend cross - examiner	3071	" At least I told Sir Abraham that I would resign ; and of course I must now do so . "
72929	72934	72936	72937	the archdeacon	381	" Not at all , "
72945	72989	72936	72937	the archdeacon	381	" Nothing that you say in such a way to your own counsel can be in any way binding on you ; of course you were there to ask his advice . I 'm sure Sir Abraham did not advise any such step . "
72999	73009	73011	73015	the reverend cross - examiner	3071	" I am sure he disadvised you from it , "
73024	73039	73011	73015	the reverend cross - examiner	3071	" I 'm sure Sir Abraham must have advised you to consult your friends . "
73051	73070	73011	73015	the reverend cross - examiner	3071	" Then your threat of resignation amounts to nothing , and we are just where we were before . "
73222	73231	73233	73233	he	153	" You must be very tired , Susan , "
73235	73245	73233	73233	he	153	" would n't you like to go to bed ? "
73317	73320	73323	73323	he	381	" Why , "
73341	73372	73323	73323	he	381	" Why did you go off from Barchester so suddenly ? Why did you take such a step without giving us notice , after what had passed at the palace ? "
73421	73430	73432	73433	the lady	609	" Papa has been too much for you , "
73445	73449	73435	73436	The archdeacon	381	" Good heavens ! "
73462	73471	73473	73474	the warden	313	" I think I 'll go to bed , "
73482	73499	73501	73502	the archdeacon	381	" At any rate , you 'll promise me to take no further step without consultation , "
73518	73522	73524	73525	the other	757	" Of course , "
73592	73646	73667	73668	The warden	313	" Mr Harding still made no reply , but looked meekly into his son - in - law 's face . The archdeacon thought he knew his father - in - law , but he was mistaken ; he thought that he had already talked over a vacillating man to resign his promise . "
73649	73653	73667	73668	The warden	313	" said he , "
73666	73666	73655	73655	Susan	109	"
73700	73724	73687	73687	he	313	" I am sure Susan will not ask me to break my word , or to do what I know to be wrong . "
73725	73728	73730	73730	she	275	" Papa , "
73732	73752	73730	73730	she	275	" it would be madness in you to throw up your preferment . What are you to live on ? "
73753	73769	73771	73772	Mr Harding	153	" God , that feeds the young ravens , will take care of me also , "
73793	73796	73798	73799	the archdeacon	381	" Pish ! "
73805	73824	73798	73799	the archdeacon	381	" If the ravens persisted in refusing the food prepared for them , they would n't be fed . "
73877	73886	73889	73890	the warden	313	" I shall have the living of Crabtree , "
73892	73898	73900	73901	the archdeacon	381	" Eighty pounds a year ! "
73903	73908	73910	73915	the father - in - law	3100	" And the precentorship , "
73917	73924	73926	73931	the son - in - law	3101	" It goes with the wardenship , "
73954	73959	73961	73961	he	112	" My dear warden , "
73963	74041	73961	73961	he	112	" this is all nonsense . Eighty pounds or a hundred and sixty makes very little difference . You ca n't live on it , you ca n't ruin Eleanor 's prospects for ever . In point of fact , you ca n't resign ; the bishop would n't accept it ; the whole thing is settled . What I now want to do is to prevent any inconvenient tittle - tattle , any more newspaper articles . "
74042	74051	74053	74054	the warden	313	" That 's what I want , too , "
74056	74062	74064	74065	the other	757	" And to prevent that , "
74067	74079	74064	74065	the other	757	" we must n't let any talk of resignation get abroad . "
74080	74086	74088	74089	the warden	313	" But I shall resign , "
74096	74112	74064	74065	the other	757	" Good heavens ! Susan , my dear , what can I say to him ? "
74113	74118	74120	74121	Mrs Grantly	133	" But , papa , "
74136	74149	74120	74121	Mrs Grantly	133	" what is Eleanor to do if you throw away your income ? "
74248	74255	74257	74258	Mrs Grantly	133	" Think of Eleanor , papa , "
74260	74267	74269	74270	her father	288	" I do think of her , "
74272	74282	74283	74284	The lady	609	" And you will not do this rash thing ? "
74294	74304	74306	74306	he	288	" It can never be rash to do right , "
74308	74316	74306	74306	he	288	" I shall certainly resign this wardenship . "
74317	74331	74333	74334	the archdeacon	381	" Then , Mr Harding , there is nothing before you but ruin , "
74342	74363	74333	74334	the archdeacon	381	" Ruin both for you and Eleanor . How do you mean to pay the monstrous expenses of this action ? "
74382	74390	74392	74392	he	288	" Indeed they will , my dear , "
74394	74423	74392	74392	he	288	" One can not have the attorney - general up at twelve o'clock at night for nothing ; but of course your father has not thought of this . "
74424	74431	74433	74434	the warden	313	" I will sell my furniture , "
74436	74439	74441	74442	the other	757	" Furniture ! "
74450	74455	74457	74458	the lady	609	" Come , archdeacon , "
74460	74480	74457	74458	the lady	609	" we need n't mind that at present . You know you never expected papa to pay the costs . "
74481	74490	74492	74493	the archdeacon	381	" Such absurdity is enough to provoke Job , "
74503	74572	74574	74574	he	381	" Your father is like a child . Eight hundred pounds a year ! eight hundred and eighty with the house , with nothing to do . The very place for him . And to throw that up because some scoundrel writes an article in a newspaper ! Well ; I have done my duty . If he chooses to ruin his child I can not help it ; "
74628	74633	74610	74611	the warden	313	" Good - night . "
74634	74641	74643	74644	the lady	609	" Good - night , papa , "
74682	74686	74610	74611	the warden	313	" Good heavens ! "
75126	75130	75132	75132	he	313	" My dear , "
75134	75172	75132	75132	he	313	" I think I shall go back home at three o'clock to - day . I shall get home at half - past eight . I do n't think there 's anything to keep me in London . "
75173	75199	75235	75235	him	3148	" The archdeacon and I return by the early train to - morrow , papa ; wo n't you wait and go back with us ? "
75200	75218	75132	75132	he	313	" Why , Eleanor will expect me tonight ; and I 've so much to do ; and "
75219	75224	75226	75229	the archdeacon sotto voce	3148	" Much to do ! "
75237	75247	75235	75235	him	3148	" You 'd better wait for us , papa . "
75248	75263	75132	75132	he	313	" Thank ye , my dear ! I think I 'll go this afternoon . "
75287	75298	75300	75301	the lady	609	" I suppose you wo n't be back before three ? "
75307	75315	75317	75318	the warden	313	" I must leave this at two , "
75320	75327	75329	75330	the archdeacon	381	" Quite out of the question , "
75344	75356	75329	75330	the archdeacon	381	" I do n't suppose I shall be back till five . "
75373	75382	75384	75385	the archdeacon	381	" I must go to Cox and Cummins , "
75389	75397	75399	75400	the warden	313	" Oh , to Cox and Cummins , "
75576	75592	75594	75594	he	381	" I suppose I shall see you at Barchester the day after to - morrow , "
75602	75626	75628	75629	the archdeacon	381	" I must once more beseech you to take no further steps till you see my father ; if you owe me nothing , "
75643	75654	75633	75633	he	381	" at least you owe so much to my father ; "
75712	75715	75716	75716	she	133	" Papa , "
75719	75727	75716	75716	she	133	" this is a most serious business . "
75728	75733	75735	75736	the warden	313	" Indeed it is , "
75742	75755	75716	75716	she	133	" I greatly feel the distress of mind you must have endured . "
75756	75766	75768	75768	he	313	" I am sure you do , my dear ; "
75782	75791	75716	75716	she	133	" Are you going to write , papa ? "
75792	75809	75716	75716	she	133	" Yes , my dear ; I am going to write my resignation to the bishop . "
75810	75846	75716	75716	she	133	" Pray , pray , papa , put it off till our return ; pray put it off till you have seen the bishop ; dear papa ! for my sake , for Eleanor 's ! "
75847	75880	75716	75716	she	133	" It is for your sake and Eleanor 's that I do this . I hope , at least , that my children may never have to be ashamed of their father . "
75881	75891	75893	75893	she	3172	" How can you talk about shame , papa ? "
75911	75930	75896	75897	the waiter	2729	" how can you talk about shame ? you know what all your friends think about this question . "
75960	75971	75973	75974	his daughter	275	" You wo n't refuse me one request , papa ? "
75976	75998	75973	75974	his daughter	275	" you wo n't refuse to delay your letter for two short days ? Two days can make no possible difference . "
75999	76003	76005	76005	he	313	" My dear , "
76008	76026	76005	76005	he	313	" if I waited till I got to Barchester , I might , perhaps , be prevented . "
76027	76039	76041	76041	she	275	" But surely you would not wish to offend the bishop ? "
76043	76076	75973	75974	his daughter	275	" God forbid ! The bishop is not apt to take offence , and knows me too well to take in bad part anything that I may be called on to do . "
76077	76081	75973	75974	his daughter	275	" But , papa "
76082	76085	76087	76087	he	313	" Susan , "
76089	76146	76087	76087	he	313	" my mind on this subject is made up ; it is not without much repugnance that I act in opposition to the advice of such men as Sir Abraham Haphazard and the archdeacon ; but in this matter I can take no advice , I can not alter the resolution to which I have come . "
76147	76153	75973	75974	his daughter	275	" But two days , papa "
76154	76196	76207	76207	he	313	" No ; nor can I delay it . You may add to my present unhappiness by pressing me , but you can not change my purpose ; it will be a comfort to me if you will let the matter rest "
77582	77586	77588	77588	he	153	" My dear , "
77623	77643	77595	77595	she	110	" I hope you 'll be able to feel a proper degree of respect for the vicar of Crabtree . "
77644	77648	77650	77650	she	110	" Dear papa , "
77652	77658	77650	77650	she	110	" I am so glad . "
77948	77954	77956	77956	Eleanor	110	" Not all , papa , "
77959	77967	77969	77969	he	153	" Not quite all , my dear , "
77971	78020	77969	77969	he	153	" that is , if we can help it . We must have a little at Crabtree , but it can only be a little ; we must put a bold front on it , Nelly ; it is n't easy to come down from affluence to poverty . "
78654	78660	78662	78663	Mr Cox	235	" Eight hundred a year ! "
78665	78672	78674	78675	Mr Cummins	137	" And nothing whatever to do ! "
78683	78691	78693	78694	Mr Cox	235	" No private fortune , I believe , "
78696	78701	78703	78704	Mr Cummins	137	" Not a shilling , "
78716	78729	78731	78732	Mr Cox	235	" I never heard of such a case in all my experience , "
78734	78757	78759	78760	Mr Cummins	137	" Eight hundred a year , and as nice a house as any gentleman could wish to hang up his hat in , "
78762	78771	78773	78774	Mr Cox	235	" And an unmarried daughter , I believe , "
78811	78821	78823	78824	Mr Cummins	137	" I 'll tell you what he might do , "
78829	78844	78823	78824	Mr Cummins	137	" I 'll tell you how you might save it : let him exchange . "
78845	78849	78851	78852	the archdeacon	381	" Exchange where ? "
78854	78919	78823	78824	Mr Cummins	137	" Exchange for a living . There 's Quiverful , of Puddingdale ; he has twelve children , and would be delighted to get the hospital . To be sure Puddingdale is only four hundred , but that would be saving something out of the fire : Mr Harding would have a curate , and still keep three hundred or three hundred and fifty . "
78936	78940	78942	78943	Mr Cummins	137	" The newspapers , "
78945	78963	78942	78943	Mr Cummins	137	" might hammer away at Quiverful every day for the next six months without his minding them . "
79032	79040	79042	79043	the bishop	254	" Pray come to me at once , "
79045	79091	79042	79043	the bishop	254	" that we may see what had better be done ; as to the hospital , I will not say a word to dissuade you ; but I do n't like your going to Crabtree : at any rate , come to me at once . "
79234	79250	79255	79255	himself	254	" How is a man to live , when he gives up all his income ? "
79545	79552	79554	79554	he	153	" The girls , you know , "
79556	79598	79554	79554	he	153	" will have it just the same when you 're gone , and they wo n't want it sooner ; and as for the interest during my lifetime , it is n't worth talking about . I have more than enough . "
79913	79920	79930	79930	he	254	" Not do , why not ? "
79939	79947	79930	79930	he	254	" Why not do , my lord ? "
79985	79996	79968	79968	he	941	" Oh ! of course he 'll have a curate . "
80045	80052	80054	80055	the archdeacon	381	" How is he to live ? "
81494	81504	81506	81507	the warden	313	" Come in , my friends , come in , "
81515	81523	81525	81525	he	313	" Come in , and sit down ; "
81913	81923	81925	81926	the warden	313	" Sit down , sit down , my friends , "
81928	81966	81925	81926	the warden	313	" I want to say a word to you and to drink your healths , before I leave you . Come up here , Moody , here is a chair for you ; come , Jonathan Crumple ; "
82059	82065	82067	82067	he	153	" My dear old friends , "
82069	82081	82067	82067	he	153	" you all know that I am going to leave you . "
82120	82197	82212	82212	Handy	123	" There has been lately some misunderstanding between us . You have thought , I believe , that you did not get all that you were entitled to , and that the funds of the hospital have not been properly disposed of . As for me , I can not say what should be the disposition of these moneys , or how they should be managed , and I have therefore thought it best to go . "
82198	82210	82212	82212	Handy	123	" We never wanted to drive your reverence out of it , "
82214	82222	82224	82224	Skulpit	144	" No , indeed , your reverence , "
82226	82252	82224	82224	Skulpit	144	" We never thought it would come to this . When I signed the petition , that is , I did n't sign it , because "
82253	82263	82265	82265	Moody	145	" Let his reverence speak , ca n't you ? "
82267	82270	82272	82273	Mr Harding	153	" No , "
82275	82350	82272	82273	Mr Harding	153	" I am sure you did not wish to turn me out ; but I thought it best to leave you . I am not a very good hand at a lawsuit , as you may all guess ; and when it seemed necessary that our ordinary quiet mode of living should be disturbed , I thought it better to go . I am neither angry nor offended with any man in the hospital . "
82365	82379	82381	82382	Mr Harding	153	" I am neither angry nor displeased with any man in the hospital , "
82386	82487	82381	82382	Mr Harding	153	" If any man has been wrong , and I do n't say any man has , he has erred through wrong advice . In this country all are entitled to look for their own rights , and you have done no more . As long as your interests and my interests were at variance , I could give you no counsel on this subject ; but the connection between us has ceased ; my income can no longer depend on your doings , and therefore , as I leave you , I venture to offer to you my advice . "
82509	82595	82381	82382	Mr Harding	153	" Some gentleman will probably take my place here very soon , and I strongly advise you to be prepared to receive him in a kindly spirit and to raise no further question among yourselves as to the amount of his income . Were you to succeed in lessening what he has to receive , you would not increase your own allowance . The surplus would not go to you ; your wants are adequately provided for , and your position could hardly be improved . "
82596	82606	82608	82608	Spriggs	146	" God bless your reverence , we knows it , "
82610	82619	82621	82621	Skulpit	144	" It 's all true , your reverence , "
82623	82630	82621	82621	Skulpit	144	" We sees it all now . "
82631	82637	82639	82639	Bunce	141	" Yes , Mr Harding , "
82649	82697	82639	82639	Bunce	141	" I believe they do understand it now , now that they 've driven from under the same roof with them such a master as not one of them will ever know again , now that they 're like to be in sore want of a friend . "
82698	82705	82707	82708	Mr Harding	153	" Come , come , Bunce , "
82724	82731	82733	82733	Handy	123	" Oh , as to that , "
82735	82778	82733	82733	Handy	123	" we none of us never wanted to do Mr Harding no harm ; if he 's going now , it 's not along of us ; and I do n't see for what Mr Bunce speaks up agen us that way . "
82779	82797	82799	82799	Bunce	141	" You 've ruined yourselves , and you 've ruined me too , and that 's why , "
82801	82806	82808	82809	Mr Harding	153	" Nonsense , Bunce , "
82811	82893	82808	82809	Mr Harding	153	" there 's nobody ruined at all . I hope you 'll let me leave you all friends ; I hope you 'll all drink a glass of wine in friendly feeling with me and with one another . You 'll have a good friend , I do n't doubt , in your new warden ; and if ever you want any other , why after all I 'm not going so far off but that I shall sometimes see you ; "
82927	82979	82981	82982	Mr Harding	153	" God bless you all ! you have my heartfelt wishes for your welfare . I hope you may live contented , and die trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ , and thankful to Almighty God For the good things he has given you . God bless you , my friends ! "
83178	83185	83187	83188	Mr Harding	153	" There 's poor old Bell , "
83190	83216	83187	83188	Mr Harding	153	" I must n't go without saying a word to him ; come through with me , Bunce , and bring the wine with you ; "
83241	83255	83257	83258	Mr Harding	153	" I 've come to say good - bye to you , Bell , "
83270	83281	83283	83283	Bell	162	" And are you going away , then , really ? "
83285	83314	83363	83364	the man	1762	" Indeed I am , and I 've brought you a glass of wine ; so that we may part friends , as we lived , you know . "
83332	83339	83341	83342	Mr Harding	153	" God bless you , Bell ! "
83344	83353	83341	83342	Mr Harding	153	" good - bye , my old friend . "
83354	83362	83363	83364	the man	1762	" And so you 're really going ? "
83368	83375	83363	83364	the man	1762	" Indeed I am , Bell . "
83436	83441	83443	83443	he	1763	" And your reverence , "
83478	83493	83469	83469	his	1763	" and your reverence , shall we get the hundred a year , then ? "
83772	83783	83785	83785	he	3509	" It is all over for me in this world , "
83799	83815	83785	83785	he	3509	" I have now to forgive those who have injured me ; and to die . "
84078	84084	84086	84086	he	153	" Now , my dear , "
84088	84111	84086	84086	he	153	" you have everything ready , and you can make tea here just as nicely as in the parlour at the hospital . "
84227	84243	84245	84246	the bishop	254	" If we can get the matter set to rights , Mr Harding will return , "
84248	84270	84245	84246	the bishop	254	" and if we can not , it will be wrong to put any other gentleman into so cruel a position . "
84303	84307	84288	84288	he	381	" good heavens ! "
85582	85609	85579	85580	the bishop	254	" The bishop 's compliments , and his lordship is not very well to - day , and he hopes Mr Harding will dine with him . "
85753	85758	85759	85759	he	153	" No , no , "
85766	85774	85759	85759	he	153	" not warden now , only precentor . "
