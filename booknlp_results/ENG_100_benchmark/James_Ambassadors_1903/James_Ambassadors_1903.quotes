25	29	4	5	Henry James	81	" The Ambassadors , "
88	254	255	256	The Ambassadors	203	" stiffly and saliently , in the centre of the current , almost perhaps to the obstruction of traffic . Never can a composition of this sort have sprung straighter from a dropped grain of suggestion , and never can that grain , developed , overgrown and smothered , have yet lurked more in the mass as an independent particle . The whole case , in fine , is in Lambert Strether 's irrepressible outbreak to little Bilham on the Sunday afternoon in Gloriani 's garden , the candour with which he yields , for his young friend 's enlightenment , to the charming admonition of that crisis . The idea of the tale resides indeed in the very fact that an hour of such unprecedented ease should have been felt by him AS a crisis , and he is at pains to express it for us as neatly as we could desire . The remarks to which he thus gives utterance contain the essence of "
258	292	255	256	The Ambassadors	203	" his fingers close , before he has done , round the stem of the full - blown flower ; which , after that fashion , he continues officiously to present to us . "
442	468	2129	2129	I	0	" Such is the gist of Strether 's appeal to the impressed youth , whom he likes and whom he desires to befriend ; the word "
470	782	2129	2129	I	0	" occurs several times , it will be seen , in the course of his remarks - which gives the measure of the signal warning he feels attached to his case . He has accordingly missed too much , though perhaps after all constitutionally qualified for a better part , and he wakes up to it in conditions that press the spring of a terrible question . WOULD there yet perhaps be time for reparation ? - reparation , that is , for the injury done his character ; for the affront , he is quite ready to say , so stupidly put upon it and in which he has even himself had so clumsy a hand ? The answer to which is that he now at all events SEES ; so that the business of my tale and the march of my action , not to say the precious moral of everything , is just my demonstration of this process of vision . Nothing can exceed the closeness with which the whole fits again into its germ . That had been given me bodily , as usual , by the spoken word , for I was to take the image over exactly as I happened to have met it . A friend had repeated to me , with great appreciation , a thing or two said to him by a man of distinction , much his senior , and to which a sense akin to that of Strether 's melancholy eloquence might be imputed - said as chance would have , and so easily might , in Paris , and in a charming old garden attached to a house of art , and on a Sunday afternoon of summer , many persons of great interest being present . The observation there listened to and gathered up had contained part of the "
784	1124	2129	2129	I	0	" that I was to recognise on the spot as to my purpose - had contained in fact the greater part ; the rest was in the place and the time and the scene they sketched : these constituents clustered and combined to give me further support , to give me what I may call the note absolute . There it stands , accordingly , full in the tideway ; driven in , with hard taps , like some strong stake for the noose of a cable , the swirl of the current roundabout it . What amplified the hint to more than the bulk of hints in general was the gift with it of the old Paris garden , for in that token were sealed up values infinitely precious . There was of course the seal to break and each item of the packet to count over and handle and estimate ; but somehow , in the light of the hint , all the elements of a situation of the sort most to my taste were there . I could even remember no occasion on which , so confronted , I had found it of a livelier interest to take stock , in this fashion , of suggested wealth . For I think , verily , that there are degrees of merit in subjects - in spite of the fact that to treat even one of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time , for the feverish and prejudiced hour , at least figure its merit and its dignity as POSSIBLY absolute . What it comes to , doubtless , is that even among the supremely good - since with such alone is it one 's theory of one 's honour to be concerned - there is an ideal BEAUTY of goodness the invoked action of which is to raise the artistic faith to its maximum . Then truly , I hold , one 's theme may be said to shine , and that of "
1128	1158	2129	2129	I	0	" I confess , wore this glow for me from beginning to end . Fortunately thus I am able to estimate this as , frankly , quite the best , "
1162	1234	2129	2129	I	0	" of all my productions ; any failure of that justification would have made such an extreme of complacency publicly fatuous . I recall then in this connexion no moment of subjective intermittence , never one of those alarms as for a suspected hollow beneath one 's feet , a felt ingratitude in the scheme adopted , under which confidence fails and opportunity seems but to mock . If the motive of "
1241	1545	2129	2129	I	0	" as I have noted , was to worry me at moments by a sealing - up of its face - though without prejudice to its again , of a sudden , fairly grimacing with expression - so in this other business I had absolute conviction and constant clearness to deal with ; it had been a frank proposition , the whole bunch of data , installed on my premises like a monotony of fine weather . The order of composition , in these things , I may mention , was reversed by the order of publication ; the earlier written of the two books having appeared as the later . Even under the weight of my hero 's years I could feel my postulate firm ; even under the strain of the difference between those of Madame de Vionnet and those of Chad Newsome , a difference liable to be denounced as shocking , I could still feel it serene . Nothing resisted , nothing betrayed , I seem to make out , in this full and sound sense of the matter ; it shed from any side I could turn it to the same golden glow . I rejoiced in the promise of a hero so mature , who would give me thereby the more to bite into - since it 's only into thickened motive and accumulated character , I think , that the painter of life bites more than a little . My poor friend should have accumulated character , certainly ; or rather would be quite naturally and handsomely possessed of it , in the sense that he would have , and would always have felt he had , imagination galore , and that this yet would n't have wrecked him . It was immeasurable , the opportunity to "
1547	1562	2129	2129	I	0	" a man of imagination , for if THERE might n't be a chance to "
1565	1791	2129	2129	I	0	" where in the world might it be ? This personage of course , so enriched , would n't give me , for his type , imagination in PREDOMINANCE or as his prime faculty , nor should I , in view of other matters , have found that convenient . So particular a luxury - some occasion , that is , for study of the high gift in SUPREME command of a case or of a career - would still doubtless come on the day I should be ready to pay for it ; and till then might , as from far back , remain hung up well in view and just out of reach . The comparative case meanwhile would serve - it was only on the minor scale that I had treated myself even to comparative cases . I was to hasten to add however that , happy stopgaps as the minor scale had thus yielded , the instance in hand should enjoy the advantage of the full range of the major ; since most immediately to the point was the question of that SUPPLEMENT of situation logically involved in our gentleman 's impulse to deliver himself in the Paris garden on the Sunday afternoon - or if not involved by strict logic then all ideally and enchantingly implied in it . I say "
1794	1999	2129	2129	I	0	" because I need scarce mention that for development , for expression of its maximum , my glimmering story was , at the earliest stage , to have nipped the thread of connexion with the possibilities of the actual reported speaker . HE remains but the happiest of accidents ; his actualities , all too definite , precluded any range of possibilities ; it had only been his charming office to project upon that wide field of the artist 's vision - which hangs there ever in place like the white sheet suspended for the figures of a child 's magic - lantern - a more fantastic and more moveable shadow . No privilege of the teller of tales and the handler of puppets is more delightful , or has more of the suspense and the thrill of a game of difficulty breathlessly played , than just this business of looking for the unseen and the occult , in a scheme half - grasped , by the light or , so to speak , by the clinging scent , of the gage already in hand . No dreadful old pursuit of the hidden slave with bloodhounds and the rag of association can ever , for "
2002	2060	2129	2129	I	0	" I judge , have bettered it at its best . For the dramatist always , by the very law of his genius , believes not only in a possible right issue from the rightly - conceived tight place ; he does much more than this - he believes , irresistibly , in the necessary , the precious "
2062	2122	2129	2129	I	0	" of the place whatever the issue on the strength of any respectable hint . It being thus the respectable hint that I had with such avidity picked up , what would be the story to which it would most inevitably form the centre ? It is part of the charm attendant on such questions that the ' story , "
2294	2297	2284	2287	the servants of man	209	" character , "
2374	2377	2379	2380	the ladies	211	" matching , "
2610	2612	2605	2605	my	0	" hunt "
2823	2826	2805	2819	man of imagination , to be logically and , as the artless craft of comedy	225	" led up "

3241	3243	3235	3235	I	0	" everything "
3447	3656	3444	3444	my	0	" would leave nothing to be desired . There is always , of course , for the story - teller , the irresistible determinant and the incalculable advantage of his interest in the story AS SUCH ; it is ever , obviously , overwhelmingly , the prime and precious thing as other than this I have never been able to see it ; as to which what makes for it , with whatever headlong energy , may be said to pale before the energy with which it simply makes for itself . It rejoices , none the less , at its best , to seem to offer itself in a light , to seem to know , and with the very last knowledge , what it 's about - liable as it yet is at moments to be caught by us with its tongue in its cheek and absolutely no warrant but its splendid impudence . Let us grant then that the impudence is always there - there , so to speak , for grace and effect and ALLURE ; there , above all , because the Story is just the spoiled child of art , and because , as we are always disappointed when the pampered do n't "
3660	4245	3444	3444	my	0	" we like it , to that extent , to look all its character . It probably does so , in truth , even when we most flatter ourselves that we negotiate with it by treaty . All of which , again , is but to say that the STEPS , for my fable , placed themselves with a prompt and , as it were , functional assurance - an air quite as of readiness to have dispensed with logic had I been in fact too stupid for my clue . Never , positively , none the less , as the links multiplied , had I felt less stupid than for the determination of poor Strether 's errand and for the apprehension of his issue . These things continued to fall together , as by the neat action of their own weight and form , even while their commentator scratched his head about them ; he easily sees now that they were always well in advance of him . As the case completed itself he had in fact , from a good way behind , to catch up with them , breathless and a little flurried , as he best could . THE false position , for our belated man of the world - belated because he had endeavoured so long to escape being one , and now at last had really to face his doom - the false position for him , I say , was obviously to have presented himself at the gate of that boundless menagerie primed with a moral scheme of the most approved pattern which was yet framed to break down on any approach to vivid facts ; that is to any at all liberal appreciation of them . There would have been of course the case of the Strether prepared , wherever presenting himself , only to judge and to feel meanly ; but HE would have moved for me , I confess , enveloped in no legend whatever . The actual man 's note , from the first of our seeing it struck , is the note of discrimination , just as his drama is to become , under stress , the drama of discrimination . It would have been his blest imagination , we have seen , that had already helped him to discriminate ; the element that was for so much of the pleasure of my cutting thick , as I have intimated , into his intellectual , into his moral substance . Yet here it was , at the same time , just here , that a shade for a moment fell across the scene . There was the dreadful little old tradition , one of the platitudes of the human comedy , that people 's moral scheme DOES break down in Paris ; that nothing is more frequently observed ; that hundreds of thousands of more or less hypocritical or more or less cynical persons annually visit the place for the sake of the probable catastrophe , and that I came late in the day to work myself up about it . There was in fine the TRIVIAL association , one of the vulgarest in the world ; but which give me pause no longer , I think , simply because its vulgarity is so advertised . The revolution performed by Strether under the influence of the most interesting of great cities was to have nothing to do with any betise of the imputably "
4247	4455	3444	3444	my	0	" state ; he was to be thrown forward , rather , thrown quite with violence , upon his lifelong trick of intense reflexion : which friendly test indeed was to bring him out , through winding passages , through alternations of darkness and light , very much IN Paris , but with the surrounding scene itself a minor matter , a mere symbol for more things than had been dreamt of in the philosophy of Woollett . Another surrounding scene would have done as well for our show could it have represented a place in which Strether 's errand was likely to lie and his crisis to await him . The LIKELY place had the great merit of sparing me preparations ; there would have been too many involved - not at all impossibilities , only rather worrying and delaying difficulties - in positing elsewhere Chad Newsome 's interesting relation , his so interesting complexity of relations . Strether 's appointed stage , in fine , could be but Chad 's most luckily selected one . The young man had gone in , as they say , for circumjacent charm ; and where he would have found it , by the turn of his mind , most "
4458	4494	4495	4496	The Ambassadors	203	" was where his earnest friend 's analysis would most find HIM ; as well as where , for that matter , the former 's whole analytic faculty would be led such a wonderful dance . "
4497	4504	4495	4496	The Ambassadors	203	" had been , all conveniently , "
4507	4844	3444	3444	my	0	" ; its first appearance was from month to month , in the North American Review during 1903 , and I had been open from far back to any pleasant provocation for ingenuity that might reside in one 's actively adopting - so as to make it , in its way , a small compositional law - recurrent breaks and resumptions . I had made up my mind here regularly to exploit and enjoy these often rather rude jolts - having found , as I believed an admirable way to it ; yet every question of form and pressure , I easily remember , paled in the light of the major propriety , recognised as soon as really weighed ; that of employing but one centre and keeping it all within my hero 's compass . The thing was to be so much this worthy 's intimate adventure that even the projection of his consciousness upon it from beginning to end without intermission or deviation would probably still leave a part of its value for him , and a fortiori for ourselves , unexpressed . I might , however , express every grain of it that there would be room for - on condition of contriving a splendid particular economy . Other persons in no small number were to people the scene , and each with his or her axe to grind , his or her situation to treat , his or her coherency not to fail of , his or her relation to my leading motive , in a word , to establish and carry on . But Strether 's sense of these things , and Strether 's only , should avail me for showing them ; I should know them but through his more or less groping knowledge of them , since his very gropings would figure among his most interesting motions , and a full observance of the rich rigour I speak of would give me more of the effect I should be most "
4846	5097	4495	4496	The Ambassadors	203	" than all other possible observances together . It would give me a large unity , and that in turn would crown me with the grace to which the enlightened story - teller will at any time , for his interest , sacrifice if need be all other graces whatever . I refer of course to the grace of intensity , which there are ways of signally achieving and ways of signally missing - as we see it , all round us , helplessly and woefully missed . Not that it is n't , on the other hand , a virtue eminently subject to appreciation - there being no strict , no absolute measure of it ; so that one may hear it acclaimed where it has quite escaped one 's perception , and see it unnoticed where one has gratefully hailed it . After all of which I am not sure , either , that the immense amusement of the whole cluster of difficulties so arrayed may not operate , for the fond fabulist , when judicious not less than fond , as his best of determinants . That charming principle is always there , at all events , to keep interest fresh : it is a principle , we remember , essentially ravenous , without scruple and without mercy , appeased with no cheap nor easy nourishment . It enjoys the costly sacrifice and rejoices thereby in the very odour of difficulty - even as ogres , with their "
5104	5153	5154	5154	Chad	111	" rejoice in the smell of the blood of Englishmen . Thus it was , at all events , that the ultimate , though after all so speedy , definition of my gentleman 's job - his coming out , all solemnly appointed and deputed , to ' save "
5271	5274	5253	5253	I	0	" gone in "
5610	5612	5652	5652	readers	244	" judicious "
5821	5850	5812	5812	Strether	82	" as it were , to himself . Had I , meanwhile , made him at once hero and historian , endowed him with the romantic privilege of the "
5853	5995	6287	6288	Gil Blas	92	" - the darkest abyss of romance this , inveterately , when enjoyed on the grand scale - variety , and many other queer matters as well , might have been smuggled in by a back door . Suffice it , to be brief , that the first person , in the long piece , is a form foredoomed to looseness and that looseness , never much my affair , had never been so little so as on this particular occasion . All of which reflexions flocked to the standard from the moment - a very early one - the question of how to keep my form amusing while sticking so close to my central figure and constantly taking its pattern from him had to be faced . He arrives arrives at Chester as for the dreadful purpose of giving his creator "
5998	6043	6287	6288	Gil Blas	92	" to tell about him - before which rigorous mission the serenest of creators might well have quailed . I was far from the serenest ; I was more than agitated enough to reflect that , grimly deprived of one alternative or one substitute for "
6046	6237	6287	6288	Gil Blas	92	" I must address myself tooth and nail to another . I could n't , save by implication , make other persons tell EACH OTHER about him - blest resource , blest necessity , of the drama , which reaches its effects of unity , all remarkably , by paths absolutely opposite to the paths of the novel : with other persons , save as they were primarily HIS persons not he primarily but one of theirs , I had simply nothing to do . I had relations for him none the less , by the mercy of Providence , quite as much as if my exhibition was to be a muddle ; if I could only by implication and a show of consequence make other persons tell each other about him , I could at least make him tell THEM whatever in the world he must ; and could so , by the same token - which was a further luxury thrown in - see straight into the deep differences between what that could do for me , or at all events for HIM , and the large ease of "
6240	6264	6287	6288	Gil Blas	92	" It may be asked why , if one so keeps to one 's hero , one should n't make a single mouthful of "
6267	6286	6287	6288	Gil Blas	92	" should n't throw the reins on his neck and , letting them flap there as free as in "
6289	6292	6287	6288	Gil Blas	92	" or in "
6296	6351	6293	6294	David Copperfield	93	" equip him with the double privilege of subject and object - a course that has at least the merit of brushing away questions at a sweep . The answer to which is , I think , that one makes that surrender only if one is prepared NOT to make certain precious discriminations . The "
6354	6422	6423	6425	The Ambassadors "	94	" then , so employed , is addressed by the author directly to ourselves , his possible readers , whom he has to reckon with , at the best , by our English tradition , so loosely and vaguely after all , so little respectfully , on so scant a presumption of exposure to criticism . Strether , on the other hand , encaged and provided for as "
6425	6569	6423	6425	The Ambassadors "	94	" encages and provides , has to keep in view proprieties much stiffer and more salutary than any our straight and credulous gape are likely to bring home to him , has exhibitional conditions to meet , in a word , that forbid the terrible FLUIDITY of self - revelation . I may seem not to better the case for my discrimination if I say that , for my first care , I had thus inevitably to set him up a confidant or two , to wave away with energy the custom of the seated mass of explanation after the fact , the inserted block of merely referential narrative , which flourishes so , to the shame of the modern impatience , on the serried page of Balzac , but which seems simply to appal our actual , our general weaker , digestion . "
6575	6893	6423	6425	The Ambassadors "	94	" took at any rate more doing , as the phrase is , not only than the reader of to - day demands , but than he will tolerate at any price any call upon him either to understand or remotely to measure ; and for the beauty of the thing when done the current editorial mind in particular appears wholly without sense . It is not , however , primarily for either of these reasons , whatever their weight , that Strether 's friend Waymarsh is so keenly clutched at , on the threshold of the book , or that no less a pounce is made on Maria Gostrey - without even the pretext , either , of HER being , in essence , Strether 's friend . She is the reader 's friend much rather - in consequence of dispositions that make him so eminently require one ; and she acts in that capacity , and REALLY in that capacity alone , with exemplary devotion from beginning to and of the book . She is an enrolled , a direct , aid to lucidity ; she is in fine , to tear off her mask , the most unmitigated and abandoned of ficelles . Half the dramatist 's art , as we well know - since if we do n't it 's not the fault of the proofs that lie scattered about us - is in the use of ficelles ; by which I mean in a deep dissimulation of his dependence on them . Waymarsh only to a slighter degree belongs , in the whole business , less to my subject than to my treatment of it ; the interesting proof , in these connexions , being that one has but to take one 's subject for the stuff of drama to interweave with enthusiasm as many Gostreys as need be . The material of "
6897	6906	6423	6425	The Ambassadors "	94	" conforming in this respect exactly to that of "
6913	7123	7124	7125	The Ambassadors	203	" published just before it , is taken absolutely for the stuff of drama ; so that , availing myself of the opportunity given me by this edition for some prefatory remarks on the latter work , I had mainly to make on its behalf the point of its scenic consistency . It disguises that virtue , in the oddest way in the world , by just LOOKING , as we turn its pages , as little scenic as possible ; but it sharply divides itself , just as the composition before us does , into the parts that prepare , that tend in fact to over - prepare , for scenes , and the parts , or otherwise into the scenes , that justify and crown the preparation . It may definitely be said , I think , that everything in it that is not scene not , I of course mean , complete and functional scene , treating ALL the submitted matter , as by logical start , logical turn , and logical finish is discriminated preparation , is the fusion and synthesis of picture . These alternations propose themselves all recogniseably , I think , from an early stage , as the very form and figure of "
7126	7221	6423	6425	The Ambassadors "	94	" ; so that , to repeat , such an agent as Miss Gostrey pre - engaged at a high salary , but waits in the draughty wing with her shawl and her smelling - salts . Her function speaks at once for itself , and by the time she has dined with Strether in London and gone to a play with him her intervention as a ficelle is , I hold , expertly justified . Thanks to it we have treated scenically , and scenically alone , the whole lumpish question of Strether 's "
7224	7275	6423	6425	The Ambassadors "	94	" which has seen us more happily on the way than anything else could have done ; we have strained to a high lucidity and vivacity or at least we hope we have certain indispensable facts ; we have seen our two or three immediate friends all conveniently and profitably in "
7277	7407	6423	6425	The Ambassadors "	94	" ; to say nothing of our beginning to descry others , of a remoter intensity , getting into motion , even if a bit vaguely as yet , for our further enrichment . Let my first point be here that the scene in question , that in which the whole situation at Woollett and the complex forces that have propelled my hero to where this lively extractor of his value and distiller of his essence awaits him , is normal and entire , is really an excellent STANDARD scene ; copious , comprehensive , and accordingly never short , but with its office as definite as that of the hammer on the gong of the clock , the office of expressing ALL THAT IS IN the hour . The "
7409	7461	6423	6425	The Ambassadors "	94	" character of the subordinate party is as artfully dissimulated , throughout , as may be , and to that extent that , with the seams or joints of Maria Gostrey 's ostensible connectedness taken particular care of , duly smoothed over , that is , and anxiously kept from showing as "
7465	7520	6423	6425	The Ambassadors "	94	" this figure doubtless achieves , after a fashion , something of the dignity of a prime idea : which circumstance but shows us afresh how many quite incalculable but none the less clear sources of enjoyment for the infatuated artist , how many copious springs of our never - to - be - slighted "
7522	7565	7124	7125	The Ambassadors	203	" for the reader and critic susceptible of contagion , may sound their incidental plash as soon as an artistic process begins to enjoy free development . Exquisite - in illustration of this - the mere interest and amusement of such at once "
7567	7623	7124	7125	The Ambassadors	203	" and critical questions as how and where and why to make Miss Gostrey 's false connexion carry itself , under a due high polish , as a real one . Nowhere is it more of an artful expedient for mere consistency of form , to mention a case , than in the last ' scene "

11588	11609	11610	11610	She	259	" Find out who you are ? - after the uplifted young woman there has seen us thus scrape acquaintance ! "
11625	11678	11679	11679	she	259	" Is n't it a reason the more ? If what you 're afraid of is the injury for me - my being seen to walk off with a gentleman who has to ask who I am - I assure you I do n't in the least mind . Here , however , "
11682	11716	11679	11679	she	259	" is my card , and as I find there 's something else again I have to say at the office , you can just study it during the moment I leave you . "
11763	11767	11757	11757	He	82	" Maria Gostrey , "
11967	11969	11990	11990	he	82	" wrong "
12056	12061	12044	12045	Maria Gostrey	97	" So now - ! "
12121	12123	12150	12150	She	97	" Europe "
12203	12257	12193	12193	she	97	" But why - fondly as it 's so easy to imagine your clinging to it - do n't you put it away ? Or if it 's an inconvenience to you to carry it , one 's often glad to have one 's card back . The fortune one spends in them ! "
12341	12345	12346	12346	she	97	" I like , "
12349	12353	12346	12346	she	97	" your name . "
12354	12357	12358	12358	he	82	" Oh , "
12361	12370	12358	12358	he	82	" you wo n't have heard of it ! "
12406	12413	12393	12393	She	97	" ' Mr. Lewis Lambert Strether ' "
12434	12451	12426	12426	She	97	" particularly the Lewis Lambert . It 's the name of a novel of Balzac 's . "
12452	12458	12460	12460	Strether	82	" Oh I know that ! "
12462	12472	12460	12460	Strether	82	" But the novel 's an awfully bad one . "
12473	12479	12480	12480	Strether	82	" I know that too , "
12495	12502	12485	12485	he	82	" I come from Woollett Massachusetts . "
12530	12535	12536	12536	she	97	" You say that , "
12539	12551	12536	12536	she	97	" as if you wanted one immediately to know the worst . "
12552	12561	12562	12562	he	82	" Oh I think it 's a thing , "
12565	12620	12562	12562	he	82	" that you must already have made out . I feel it so that I certainly must look it , speak it , and , as people say there , ' act ' it . It sticks out of me , and you knew surely for yourself as soon as you looked at me . "
12621	12628	12536	12536	she	97	" The worst , you mean ? "
12629	12669	12562	12562	he	82	" Well , the fact of where I come from . There at any rate it IS ; so that you wo n't be able , if anything happens , to say I 've not been straight with you . "
12670	12673	12562	12562	he	82	" I see "
12688	12698	12684	12684	he	82	" But what do you think of as happening ? "
12741	12751	12731	12731	his	82	" Why that you should find me too hopeless . "
12770	12772	12731	12731	his	82	" hopeless "
13061	13072	13055	13056	Miss Gostrey	99	" You 're doing something that you think not right . "
13090	13100	13084	13084	his	82	" Am I enjoying it as much as THAT ? "
13101	13117	13055	13056	Miss Gostrey	99	" You 're not enjoying it , I think , so much as you ought . "
13118	13121	13123	13123	he	82	" I see "
13129	13135	13123	13123	he	82	" Great is my privilege . "
13136	13164	13055	13056	Miss Gostrey	99	" Oh it 's not your privilege ! It has nothing to do with me . It has to do with yourself . Your failure 's general . "
13165	13171	13172	13172	he	82	" Ah there you are ! "
13175	13187	13172	13172	he	82	" It 's the failure of Woollett . THAT 'S general . "
13188	13194	13195	13196	Miss Gostrey	99	" The failure to enjoy , "
13199	13205	13195	13196	Miss Gostrey	99	" is what I mean . "
13206	13232	13233	13233	Strether	82	" Precisely . Woollett is n't sure it ought to enjoy . If it were it would . But it has n't , poor thing , "
13236	13254	13233	13233	Strether	82	" any one to show it how . It 's not like me . I have somebody . "
13395	13401	13403	13403	she	99	" You 've indeed somebody . "
13406	13417	13403	13403	she	99	" I wish you WOULD let me show you how ! "
13418	13426	13427	13427	he	82	" Oh I 'm afraid of you ! "
13451	13487	13488	13488	she	99	" Ah no , you 're not ! You 're not in the least , thank goodness ! If you had been we should n't so soon have found ourselves here together . I think , "
13492	13497	13488	13488	she	99	" you trust me . "
13498	13541	13542	13542	Strether	82	" I think I do ! - but that 's exactly what I 'm afraid of . I should n't mind if I did n't . It 's falling thus in twenty minutes so utterly into your hands . I dare say , "
13545	13568	13569	13569	She	99	" it 's a sort of thing you 're thoroughly familiar with ; but nothing more extraordinary has ever happened to me . "
13577	13600	13569	13569	She	99	" That means simply that you 've recognised me - which IS rather beautiful and rare . You see what I am . "
13631	13891	13624	13624	she	99	" If you 'll only come on further as you HAVE come you 'll at any rate make out . My own fate has been too many for me , and I 've succumbed to it . I 'm a general guide - to ' Europe , ' do n't you know ? I wait for people - I put them through . I pick them up - I set them down . I 'm a sort of superior ' courier - maid . ' I 'm a companion at large . I take people , as I 've told you , about . I never sought it - it has come to me . It has been my fate , and one 's fate one accepts . It 's a dreadful thing to have to say , in so wicked a world , but I verily believe that , such as you see me , there 's nothing I do n't know . I know all the shops and the prices - but I know worse things still . I bear on my back the huge load of our national consciousness , or , in other words - for it comes to that - of our nation itself . Of what is our nation composed but of the men and women individually on my shoulders ? I do n't do it , you know , for any particular advantage . I do n't do it , for instance - some people do , you know - for money . "
13903	13930	13931	13931	He	82	" And yet , affected as you are then to so many of your clients , you can scarcely be said to do it for love . "
13936	13943	13931	13931	He	82	" How do we reward you ? "
13951	13956	13957	13957	she	386	" You do n't ! "
14042	14051	14052	14052	He	82	" You 're really in terror of him . "
14064	14076	14052	14052	He	82	" Now you can see why I 'm afraid of you . "
14077	14099	14100	14100	she	386	" Because I 've such illuminations ? Why they 're all for your help ! It 's what I told you , "
14103	14115	14100	14100	she	386	" just now . You feel as if this were wrong . "
14135	14141	14142	14142	Her	386	" Then get me out ! "
14169	14183	14165	14165	she	386	" Out of waiting for him ? - of seeing him at all ? "
14184	14191	14194	14194	Strether	82	" Oh no - not that , "
14199	14299	14300	14300	She	386	" I 've got to wait for him - and I want very much to see him . But out of the terror . You did put your finger on it a few minutes ago . It 's general , but it avails itself of particular occasions . That 's what it 's doing for me now . I 'm always considering something else ; something else , I mean , than the thing of the moment . The obsession of the other thing is the terror . I 'm considering at present for instance something else than YOU . "
14306	14315	14300	14300	She	386	" Oh you ought n't to do that ! "
14316	14328	14329	14329	She	386	" It 's what I admit . Make it then impossible . "
14334	14359	14329	14329	She	386	" Is it really an ' order ' from you ? - that I shall take the job ? WILL you give yourself up ? "
14366	14391	14363	14363	his	82	" If I only could ! But that 's the deuce of it - that I never can . No - I ca n't . "
14400	14408	14392	14392	She	386	" But you want to at least ? "
14409	14413	14363	14363	his	82	" Oh unspeakably ! "
14414	14423	14426	14426	she	386	" Ah then , if you 'll try ! "
14442	14446	14447	14447	she	386	" Trust me ! "
14487	14489	14496	14496	he	82	" nice "
14667	14671	14666	14666	her	99	" Mr. Waymarsh ! "
15668	15671	15672	15672	he	82	" Europe , "
15862	15866	15825	15825	He	82	" Congressional halls , "
16767	16791	16846	16846	his	96	" I do n't know as I quite see what you require it for . You do n't appear sick to speak of . "
16801	16804	16806	16806	Strether	82	" Well , "
16817	16843	16806	16806	Strether	82	" I guess I do n't FEEL sick now that I 've started . But I had pretty well run down before I did start . "
16850	16861	16846	16846	his	96	" Ai n't you about up to your usual average ? "
16991	17014	17015	17015	Waymarsh	96	" That description hardly does justice to a man to whom it has done such a lot of good to see YOU . "
17061	17065	17066	17067	his friend	259	" I mean , "
17071	17098	17066	17067	his friend	259	" that your appearance is n't as bad as I 've seen it : it compares favourably with what it was when I last noticed it . "
17140	17149	17137	17137	he	96	" You 've filled out some since then . "
17150	17157	17137	17137	he	96	" I 'm afraid I have , "
17161	17200	17158	17158	Strether	82	" one does fill out some with all one takes in , and I 've taken in , I dare say , more than I 've natural room for . I was dog - tired when I sailed . "
17209	17216	17217	17218	his companion	388	" I was dog - tired , "
17221	17390	17217	17218	his companion	388	" when I arrived , and it 's this wild hunt for rest that takes all the life out of me . The fact is , Strether - and it 's a comfort to have you here at last to say it to ; though I do n't know , after all , that I 've really waited ; I 've told it to people I 've met in the cars - the fact is , such a country as this ai n't my KIND of country anyway . There ai n't a country I 've seen over here that DOES seem my kind . Oh I do n't say but what there are plenty of pretty places and remarkable old things ; but the trouble is that I do n't seem to feel anywhere in tune . That 's one of the reasons why I suppose I 've gained so little . I have n't had the first sign of that lift I was led to expect . "
17399	17409	17393	17393	he	478	" Look here - I want to go back . "
17461	17482	17493	17493	Waymarsh	96	" That 's a genial thing to say to a fellow who has come out on purpose to meet you ! "
17498	17506	17493	17493	Waymarsh	96	" HAVE you come out on purpose ? "
17507	17513	17551	17551	Strether	82	" Well - very largely . "
17514	17529	17530	17530	Strether	82	" I thought from the way you wrote there was something back of it . "
17533	17543	17530	17530	Strether	82	" Back of my desire to be with you ? "
17544	17550	17551	17551	Strether	82	" Back of your prostration . "
17568	17577	17565	17565	his	82	" There are all the causes of it ! "
17578	17590	17591	17592	Our friend	235	" And no particular cause that seemed most to drive you ? "
17599	17619	17591	17592	Our friend	235	" Yes . One . There IS a matter that has had much to do with my coming out . "
17625	17631	17620	17620	Waymarsh	96	" Too private to mention ? "
17632	17646	17565	17565	his	82	" No , not too private - for YOU . Only rather complicated . "
17647	17650	17652	17652	Waymarsh	96	" Well , "
17659	17680	17652	17652	Waymarsh	96	" I MAY lose my mind over here , but I do n't know as I 've done so yet . "
17681	17694	17695	17695	Waymarsh	96	" Oh you shall have the whole thing . But not tonight . "
17707	17717	17695	17695	Waymarsh	96	" Why not - if I ca n't sleep ? "
17718	17728	17695	17695	Waymarsh	96	" Because , my dear man , I CAN ! "
17729	17736	17695	17695	Waymarsh	96	" Then where 's your prostration ? "
17737	17750	17695	17695	Waymarsh	96	" Just in that - that I can put in eight hours . "
17761	17763	17695	17695	Waymarsh	96	" gain "
17912	17925	17926	17926	Strether	82	" Is she really after you ? Is that what 's behind ? "
17948	17954	17941	17941	he	82	" Behind my coming out ? "
17955	17978	17979	17979	Strether	82	" Behind your prostration or whatever . It 's generally felt , you know , that she follows you up pretty close . "
17988	18005	17979	17979	Strether	82	" Oh it has occurred to you that I 'm literally running away from Mrs. Newsome ? "
18006	18033	18035	18035	Waymarsh	96	" Well , I have n't KNOWN but what you are . You 're a very attractive man , Strether . You 've seen for yourself , "
18036	18048	18049	18049	he	96	" what that lady downstairs makes of it . Unless indeed , "
18062	18077	18078	18078	He	96	" it 's you who are after HER . IS Mrs. Newsome OVER here ? "
18099	18169	18170	18170	Waymarsh	96	" Dear no she 's safe , thank goodness - as I think I more and more feel - at home . She thought of coming , but she gave it up . I 've come in a manner instead of her ; and come to that extent - for you 're right in your inference - on her business . So you see there IS plenty of connexion . "
18180	18191	18170	18170	Waymarsh	96	" Involving accordingly the particular one I 've referred to ? "
18232	18295	18296	18296	Waymarsh	96	" Involving more things than I can think of breaking ground on now . But do n't be afraid - you shall have them from me : you 'll probably find yourself having quite as much of them as you can do with . I shall - if we keep together - very much depend on your impression of some of them . "
18306	18320	18296	18296	Waymarsh	96	" You mean to say you do n't believe we WILL keep together ? "
18321	18329	18330	18330	Strether	82	" I only glance at the danger , "
18334	18356	18330	18330	Strether	82	" because when I hear you wail to go back I seem to see you open up such possibilities of folly . "
18370	18380	18357	18357	Waymarsh	96	" What are you going to do with me ? "
18413	18425	18405	18405	HE	96	" I 'm going to take you right down to London . "
18426	18435	18436	18436	Waymarsh	96	" Oh I 've been down to London ! "
18441	18454	18436	18436	Waymarsh	96	" I 've no use , Strether , for anything down there . "
18455	18458	18460	18460	Strether	82	" Well , "
18466	18476	18460	18460	Strether	82	" I guess you 've some use for me . "
18477	18485	18436	18436	Waymarsh	96	" So I 've got to go ? "
18486	18496	18436	18436	Waymarsh	96	" Oh you 've got to go further yet . "
18497	18500	18501	18501	Waymarsh	96	" Well , "
18504	18524	18501	18501	Waymarsh	96	" do your damnedest ! Only you WILL tell me before you lead me on all the way - ? "
18569	18574	18561	18561	he	235	" Tell you - ? "
18575	18584	18585	18585	Strether	82	" Why what you 've got on hand . "
18588	18613	18585	18585	Strether	82	" Why it 's such a matter as that even if I positively wanted I should n't be able to keep it from you . "
18618	18633	18585	18585	Strether	82	" What does that mean then but that your trip is just FOR her ? "
18634	18651	18561	18561	he	235	" For Mrs. Newsome ? Oh it certainly is , as I say . Very much . "
18652	18664	18665	18665	Strether	82	" Then why do you also say it 's for me ? "
18676	18689	18665	18665	Strether	82	" It 's simple enough . It 's for both of you . "
18699	18708	18690	18690	Waymarsh	96	" Well , I wo n't marry you ! "
18709	18719	18665	18665	Strether	82	" Neither , when it comes to that - ! "
19054	19069	19070	19070	They	508	" There are times when to give them their head , you know - ! "
19094	19099	19089	19089	her	327	" Well , what ? "
19100	19137	19089	19089	her	327	" Is to bring about for them such a complexity of relations - unless indeed we call it a simplicity ! - that the situation HAS to wind itself up . They want to go back . "
19138	19146	19147	19147	Strether	82	" And you want them to go ! "
19151	19170	19147	19147	Strether	82	" I always want them to go , and I send them as fast as I can . ' "
19181	19182	19175	19175	you	0	" "
19228	19286	19287	19288	Other people	515	" The ordered English garden , in the freshness of the day , was delightful to Strether , who liked the sound , under his feet , of the tight fine gravel , packed with the chronic damp , and who had the idlest eye for the deep smoothness of turf and the clean curves of paths . "
19290	19291	19287	19288	Other people	515	" "
19307	19311	19300	19300	I	0	" Strether wondered . "
19336	19337	19300	19300	I	0	" "
19411	19416	19406	19406	you	518	" said Maria Gostrey , "
19491	19492	19493	19493	We	519	" "
19500	19515	19493	19493	We	519	" The further she went the further he always saw himself able to follow . "
19538	19542	19547	19547	you	518	" he echoed . "
19562	19600	19557	19557	you	518	" For a minute , amid the pleasantness - poetry in tariffed items , but all the more , for guests already convicted , a challenge to consumption - they smiled at each other in confirmed fellowship . "

19632	19767	19616	19616	you	518	" She was weak enough , further still , to defer her journey and agree to accompany the gentlemen on their own , might a separate carriage mark her independence ; though it was in spite of this to befall after luncheon that she went off alone and that , with a tryst taken for a day of her company in London , they lingered another night . She had , during the morning - spent in a way that he was to remember later on as the very climax of his foretaste , as warm with presentiments , with what he would have called collapses - had all sorts of things out with Strether ; and among them the fact that though there was never a moment of her life when she was n't "
19769	20701	20747	20750	the woman of fashion	524	" somewhere , there was yet scarce a perfidy to others of which she was n't capable for his sake . She explained moreover that wherever she happened to be she found a dropped thread to pick up , a ragged edge to repair , some familiar appetite in ambush , jumping out as she approached , yet appeasable with a temporary biscuit . It became , on her taking the risk of the deviation imposed on him by her insidious arrangement of his morning meal , a point of honour for her not to fail with Waymarsh of the larger success too ; and her subsequent boast to Strether was that she had made their friend fare - and quite without his knowing what was the matter - as Major Pendennis would have fared at the Megatherium . She had made him breakfast like a gentleman , and it was nothing , she forcibly asserted , to what she would yet make him do . She made him participate in the slow reiterated ramble with which , for Strether , the new day amply filled itself ; and it was by her art that he somehow had the air , on the ramparts and in the Rows , of carrying a point of his own . The three strolled and stared and gossiped , or at least the two did ; the case really yielding for their comrade , if analysed , but the element of stricken silence . This element indeed affected Strether as charged with audible rumblings , but he was conscious of the care of taking it explicitly as a sign of pleasant peace . He would n't appeal too much , for that provoked stiffness ; yet he would n't be too freely tacit , for that suggested giving up . Waymarsh himself adhered to an ambiguous dumbness that might have represented either the growth of a perception or the despair of one ; and at times and in places - where the low - browed galleries were darkest , the opposite gables queerest , the solicitations of every kind densest - the others caught him fixing hard some object of minor interest , fixing even at moments nothing discernible , as if he were indulging it with a truce . When he met Strether 's eye on such occasions he looked guilty and furtive , fell the next minute into some attitude of retractation . Our friend could n't show him the right things for fear of provoking some total renouncement , and was tempted even to show him the wrong in order to make him differ with triumph . There were moments when he himself felt shy of professing the full sweetness of the taste of leisure , and there were others when he found himself feeling as if his passages of interchange with the lady at his side might fall upon the third member of their party very much as Mr. Burchell , at Dr. Primrose 's fireside , was influenced by the high flights of the visitors from London . The smallest things so arrested and amused him that he repeatedly almost apologised - brought up afresh in explanation his plea of a previous grind . He was aware at the same time that his grind had been as nothing to Waymarsh 's , and he repeatedly confessed that , to cover his frivolity , he was doing his best for his previous virtue . Do what he might , in any case , his previous virtue was still there , and it seemed fairly to stare at him out of the windows of shops that were not as the shops of Woollett , fairly to make him want things that he should n't know what to do with . It was by the oddest , the least admissible of laws demoralising him now ; and the way it boldly took was to make him want more wants . These first walks in Europe were in fact a kind of finely lurid intimation of what one might find at the end of that process . Had he come back after long years , in something already so like the evening of life , only to be exposed to it ? It was at all events over the shop - windows that he made , with Waymarsh , most free ; though it would have been easier had not the latter most sensibly yielded to the appeal of the merely useful trades . He pierced with his sombre detachment the plate - glass of ironmongers and saddlers , while Strether flaunted an affinity with the dealers in stamped letter - paper and in smart neckties . Strether was in fact recurrently shameless in the presence of the tailors , though it was just over the heads of the tailors that his countryman most loftily looked . This gave Miss Gostrey a grasped opportunity to back up Waymarsh at his expense . The weary lawyer - it was unmistakeable - had a conception of dress ; but that , in view of some of the features of the effect produced , was just what made the danger of insistence on it . Strether wondered if he by this time thought Miss Gostrey less fashionable or Lambert Strether more so ; and it appeared probable that most of the remarks exchanged between this latter pair about passers , figures , faces , personal types , exemplified in their degree the disposition to talk as ' society "
21072	21097	21098	21098	Strether	82	" He thinks us sophisticated , he thinks us worldly , he thinks us wicked , he thinks us all sorts of queer things , "
21249	21257	21242	21243	Miss Gostrey	99	" What 's the matter with him ? "
21258	21261	21263	21263	Strether	82	" Well , "
21265	21272	21263	21263	Strether	82	" he ca n't stand it . "
21273	21280	21242	21243	Miss Gostrey	99	" But ca n't stand what ? "
21281	21286	21242	21243	Miss Gostrey	99	" Anything . Europe . "
21287	21296	21297	21297	Strether	82	" Then how will that jeweller help him ? "
21322	21327	21297	21297	Strether	82	" You 'll see . "
21328	21353	21354	21354	Strether	82	" Ah that 's just what - if he buys anything - I 'm afraid of : that I shall see something rather dreadful . "
21360	21366	21354	21354	Strether	82	" He may buy everything . "
21367	21379	21297	21297	Strether	82	" Then do n't you think we ought to follow him ? "
21380	21423	21424	21424	She	546	" Not for worlds . Besides we ca n't . We 're paralysed . We exchange a long scared look , we publicly tremble . The thing is , you see , we ' realise . ' He has struck for freedom . "
21430	21448	21427	21427	she	546	" Ah what a price to pay ! And I was preparing some for him so cheap . "
21449	21454	21455	21455	Strether	82	" No , no , "
21463	21480	21455	21455	Strether	82	" do n't call it that : the kind of freedom you deal in is dear . "
21487	21501	21455	21455	Strether	82	" Am I not in MY way trying it ? It 's this . "
21502	21512	21427	21427	she	546	" Being here , you mean , with me ? "
21513	21556	21564	21564	him	82	" Yes , and talking to you as I do . I 've known you a few hours , and I 've known HIM all my life ; so that if the ease I thus take with you about him is n't magnificent "
21568	21575	21564	21564	him	82	" why it 's rather base . "
21576	21581	21583	21584	Miss Gostrey	99	" It 's magnificent ! "
21592	21598	21599	21599	she	99	" And you should hear , "
21602	21620	21599	21599	she	99	" the ease I take - and I above all intend to take - with Mr. Waymarsh . "
21624	21657	21659	21659	he	82	" About ME ? Ah that 's no equivalent . The equivalent would be Waymarsh 's himself serving me up - his remorseless analysis of me . And he 'll never do that "
21664	21672	21659	21659	he	82	" He 'll never remorselessly analyse me . "
21683	21695	21696	21696	She	99	" He 'll never say a word to you about me . "
21721	21769	21710	21710	her	99	" Of course he wo n't . For what do you take people , that they 're able to say words about anything , able remorselessly to analyse ? There are not many like you and me . It will be only because he 's too stupid . "
21792	21796	21710	21710	her	99	" Waymarsh stupid ? "
21797	21802	21803	21803	Strether	82	" Compared with you . "
21822	21836	21815	21815	he	82	" He 's a success of a kind that I have n't approached . "
21837	21846	21710	21710	her	99	" Do you mean he has made money ? "
21847	21859	21861	21861	Strether	82	" He makes it - to my belief . And I , "
21863	21884	21861	21861	Strether	82	" though with a back quite as bent , have never made anything . I 'm a perfectly equipped failure . "
21937	21984	21985	21985	she	99	" Thank goodness you 're a failure - it 's why I so distinguish you ! Anything else to - day is too hideous . Look about you - look at the successes . Would you BE one , on your honour ? Look , moreover , "
21988	21992	21985	21985	she	99	" at me . "
22001	22005	22006	22006	Strether	82	" I see , "
22009	22017	22006	22006	Strether	82	" You too are out of it . "
22018	22026	22027	22027	she	99	" The superiority you discern in me , "
22030	22039	22040	22040	she	99	" announces my futility . If you knew , "
22043	22067	22040	22040	she	99	" the dreams of my youth ! But our realities are what has brought us together . We 're beaten brothers in arms . "
22081	22100	22076	22076	he	82	" It does n't alter the fact that you 're expensive . You 've cost me already - ! "
22107	22112	22102	22102	he	82	" Cost you what ? "
22113	22128	22129	22129	he	82	" Well , my past - in one great lump . But no matter , "
22132	22141	22129	22129	he	82	" I 'll pay with my last penny . "
22168	22176	22177	22177	she	99	" I hope he has n't paid , "
22180	22201	22177	22177	she	99	" with HIS last ; though I 'm convinced he has been splendid , and has been so for you . "
22202	22209	22238	22238	he	96	" Ah no - not that ! "
22210	22215	22177	22177	she	99	" Then for me ? "
22216	22221	22177	22177	she	99	" Quite as little . "
22249	22254	22238	22238	he	96	" Then for himself ? "
22255	22265	22177	22177	she	99	" For nobody . For nothing . For freedom . "
22266	22276	22277	22277	Strether	82	" But what has freedom to do with it ? "
22283	22296	22277	22277	Strether	82	" To be as good as you and me . But different . "
22326	22334	22321	22321	she	99	" Different - yes . But better ! "
22387	22394	22375	22375	He	96	" It 's the sacred rage , "
22902	22906	22908	22908	he	96	" cut down , "
22972	22976	22978	22978	she	88	" cut down , "
23270	23272	23305	23305	He	96	" handsome "
23317	23319	23305	23305	He	96	" free "
23378	23380	23328	23328	her	575	" frill "
23778	23786	23794	23794	he	96	" Oh yes , they 're types ! "
23992	23994	23995	23995	he	96	" types "
24353	24431	24434	24434	his	605	" I seem with this freedom , you see , to have guessed Mr. Chad . He 's a young man on whose head high hopes are placed at Woollett ; a young man a wicked woman has got hold of and whom his family over there have sent you out to rescue . You 've accepted the mission of separating him from the wicked woman . Are you quite sure she 's very bad for him ? "
24444	24455	24434	24434	his	605	" Of course we are . Would n't YOU be ? "
24456	24545	24640	24640	she	606	" Oh I do n't know . One never does - does one ? - beforehand . One can only judge on the facts . Yours are quite new to me ; I 'm really not in the least , as you see , in possession of them : so it will be awfully interesting to have them from you . If you 're satisfied , that 's all that 's required . I mean if you 're sure you ARE sure : sure it wo n't do . "
24546	24557	24640	24640	she	606	" That he should lead such a life ? Rather ! "
24558	24590	24640	24640	she	606	" Oh but I do n't know , you see , about his life ; you 've not told me about his life . She may be charming - his life ! "
24591	24594	24640	24640	she	606	" Charming ? "
24601	24613	24596	24596	Strether	82	" She 's base , venal - out of the streets . "
24614	24622	24640	24640	she	606	" I see . And HE - ? "
24623	24629	24640	24640	she	606	" Chad , wretched boy ? "
24630	24639	24640	24640	she	606	" Of what type and temper is he ? "
24648	24654	24640	24640	she	606	" Well - the obstinate . "
24682	24688	24691	24691	he	82	" Do you like him ? "
24695	24702	24691	24691	he	82	" No . How CAN I ? "
24703	24716	24691	24691	he	82	" Do you mean because of your being so saddled with him ? "
24717	24725	24727	24727	Strether	82	" I 'm thinking of his mother , "
24732	24740	24741	24741	He	82	" He has darkened her admirable life . "
24746	24755	24741	24741	He	82	" He has worried her half to death . "
24756	24764	24765	24765	She	606	" Oh that 's of course odious . "
24785	24792	24765	24765	She	606	" Is her life very admirable ? "
24793	24796	24836	24836	she	606	" Extraordinarily . "
24818	24835	24836	24836	she	606	" And has he only HER ? I do n't mean the bad woman in Paris , "
24840	24868	24836	24836	she	606	" for I assure you I should n't even at the best be disposed to allow him more than one . But has he only his mother ? "
24869	24890	24765	24765	She	606	" He has also a sister , older than himself and married ; and they 're both remarkably fine women . "
24891	24898	24836	24836	she	606	" Very handsome , you mean ? "
24925	24969	24920	24920	he	607	" Mrs. Newsome , I think , is handsome , though she 's not of course , with a son of twenty - eight and a daughter of thirty , in her very first youth . She married , however , extremely young . "
24970	24975	24976	24977	Miss Gostrey	99	" And is wonderful , "
24980	24985	24976	24977	Miss Gostrey	99	" for her age ? "
24999	25011	25012	25012	he	607	" I do n't say she 's wonderful . Or rather , "
25019	25043	25044	25044	he	607	" I do say it . It 's exactly what she IS - wonderful . But I was n't thinking of her appearance , "
25065	25090	25054	25054	I	0	" He seemed to look at these as if to mention some of them ; then took , pulling himself up , another turn . "

25423	25427	25420	25420	I	0	" he laughed , "

25487	25494	25478	25478	She	88	" Ah Maria knew these things ! "
25546	25553	25536	25536	I	0	" Strether took this more lightly . "
25562	25563	25555	25555	I	0	" "
25566	25571	25555	25555	I	0	" she lucidly returned , "
25586	25592	25594	25594	they	626	" And she forged ahead . "
25597	25617	25618	25619	Mrs. Newsome	88	" But it was as if , while her energetic image still held him , her enquiry fell short . "
25621	25628	25618	25619	Mrs. Newsome	88	" he wished further to explain , "
25654	25655	25656	25657	The woman	629	" "

25682	25691	25694	25694	YOU	88	" he , however , accommodatingly threw out , "
25697	25703	25704	25704	You	88	" She shook her head . "
25745	25750	25742	25742	you	88	" Miss Gostrey pursued , "
25781	25798	25758	25758	she	88	" Strether looked amused at her notion of the simple , but he adopted her formula . "
25806	25807	25808	25808	Ah	633	" "
25818	25819	25816	25816	yours	88	" "

25908	25912	25916	25916	yours	88	" Strether laughed . "
25924	25933	25935	25936	Mrs. Newsome	88	" With which she put again her question . "
25939	25945	25935	25936	Mrs. Newsome	88	" This time he heeded . "
26004	26013	25996	25996	he	111	" She had listened with all her interest . "
26024	26025	26026	26026	He	111	" "
26035	26043	26044	26044	He	111	" said Strether without acknowledgement of this . "

26187	26191	26171	26172	Mr. Newsome	114	" Strether explained , "

26260	26288	26289	26289	I	0	" Strether looked about him as in slight reluctance to say ; then the curtain , which he saw about to rise , came to his aid . "
26296	26390	26289	26289	I	0	" But when the next time came he only said he 'd tell her later on - after they should have left the theatre ; for she had immediately reverted to their topic , and even for himself the picture of the stage was now overlaid with another image . His postponements , however , made her wonder - wonder if the article referred to were anything bad . And she explained that she meant improper or ridiculous or wrong . But Strether , so far as that went , could satisfy her . "
26462	26468	26545	26545	you	0	" In short he shrank . "
26475	26476	26545	26545	you	0	" "

26492	26503	26519	26519	you	0	" Then on his wondering as she herself had done : "
26509	26516	26519	26519	you	0	" She seemed a trifle irritated . "

26551	26552	26545	26545	you	0	" "
26556	26560	26545	26545	you	0	" laughed Strether , "
26568	26595	26545	26545	you	0	" It made between them a pause , which she , however , still fascinated by the mystery of the production at Woollett , presently broke . "
26611	26617	26605	26605	Saleratus	115	" It brought him round . "
26641	26642	26636	26636	you	0	" "
26653	26654	26646	26646	I	0	" "
26663	26786	26659	26659	I	0	" - and he persuaded her to patience . But it may even now frankly be mentioned that he in the sequel never WAS to tell her . He actually never did so , and it moreover oddly occurred that by the law , within her , of the incalculable , her desire for the information dropped and her attitude to the question converted itself into a positive cultivation of ignorance . In ignorance she could humour her fancy , and that proved a useful freedom . She could treat the little nameless object as indeed unnameable - she could make their abstention enormously definite . There might indeed have been for Strether the portent of this in what she next said . "
26835	26836	26824	26824	he	111	" "
26839	26843	26824	26824	he	111	" Strether laughed , "
26937	26938	26966	26966	he	111	" "
26947	26952	26966	26966	he	111	" Miss Gostrey asked , "
26984	26997	26966	26966	he	111	" Strether was able quite good - humouredly to entertain the proposition . "
27020	27021	26966	26966	he	111	" "
27028	27033	26966	26966	he	111	" Strether cast about . "
27038	27039	26966	26966	he	111	" "
27051	27052	27047	27049	an old swindler	652	" "
27055	27064	27047	27049	an old swindler	652	" he said with more emphasis than spirit , "
27075	27076	27065	27065	I	0	" "
27089	27090	27083	27086	the late Mr. Newsome	114	" "
27097	27098	27095	27095	him	111	" "
27105	27106	27100	27100	he	111	" "
27124	27131	27120	27120	he	111	" Miss Gostrey kept it up . "
27134	27143	27100	27100	he	111	" Her friend for a moment hung fire . "
27146	27161	27100	27100	he	111	" Her comment on his hesitation was scarce the less marked for being mute . "
27171	27176	27168	27168	you	655	" she went on , "
27191	27192	27193	27193	His	656	" "
27199	27200	27193	27193	His	656	" "

27217	27221	27193	27193	His	656	" Strether asked , "
27263	27270	27271	27272	Mrs. Newsome	88	" She showed how she understood . "
27276	27277	27271	27272	Mrs. Newsome	88	" "

27344	27357	27339	27339	You	655	" Miss Gostrey after a moment declared . It had its effect . "
27376	27377	27400	27400	you	655	" "
27389	27397	27400	27400	you	655	" she added before he could speak , "
27406	27407	27400	27400	you	655	" "
27413	27417	27409	27409	you	655	" Strether dropped , "
27425	27433	27409	27409	you	655	" She really seemed to have her . "
27448	27455	27438	27438	She	88	" This at least enlivened him . "
27463	27464	27469	27469	YOU	655	" "
27471	27484	27469	27469	YOU	655	" With which she had one of her swift changes of ground . "
27502	27503	27496	27497	Mrs. Newsome	88	" "
27537	27538	27530	27530	She	88	" "
27543	27544	27540	27540	you	655	" "

27568	27573	27575	27575	you	655	" Miss Gostrey amended , "

27616	27621	27587	27587	I	0	" Strether obligingly thought . "

27638	27639	27633	27633	you	655	" "
27677	27681	27670	27670	My	0	" Strether pursued , "
27700	27709	27683	27683	I	0	" She neglected for a moment this grievance . "
27719	27727	27683	27683	I	0	" His serenity was now completely restored . "
27734	27735	27683	27683	I	0	" "
27750	27751	27737	27737	you	655	" "

27779	27785	27771	27772	Mrs. Newsome	88	" He waited a little . "
27816	27823	27806	27806	she	88	" Miss Gostrey took it all . "
27845	27846	27838	27838	She	88	" "
27856	27857	27850	27850	she	88	" "
27889	27890	27874	27874	you	655	" "
27894	27898	27874	27874	you	655	" said Strether , "
27907	27916	27874	27874	you	655	" But she had already taken him up . "
27937	27938	27933	27933	you	655	" "
27946	27951	27952	27952	Ah	662	" he lucidly objected . "
27963	27964	27954	27954	you	655	" "
28031	28053	28054	28054	She	663	" On this she looked at him as to say many things , but what she at last simply said was : "
28070	28075	28061	28061	You	655	" she immediately continued , "
28092	28118	28119	28119	She	663	" Miss Gostrey added , ' she thinks you 're one too . You 're at all events the biggest she can get hold of . "
28125	28149	28122	28122	she	663	" I do n't say it to interfere between you , but on the day she gets hold of a bigger one - ! "
28179	28186	28154	28154	his	82	" Therefore close with her - ! "
28187	28192	28193	28193	he	82	" Close with her ? "
28202	28209	28196	28196	she	663	" Before you lose your chance . "
28216	28224	28196	28196	she	663	" What do you mean by closing ? "
28225	28256	28257	28257	she	663	" And what do I mean by your chance ? I 'll tell you when you tell me all the things YOU do n't . Is it her GREATEST fad ? "
28261	28265	28257	28257	she	663	" The Review ? "
28285	28294	28271	28271	he	82	" It 's her tribute to the ideal . "
28295	28306	28196	28196	she	663	" I see . You go in for tremendous things . "
28307	28324	28271	28271	he	82	" We go in for the unpopular side - that is so far as we dare . "
28325	28333	28196	28196	she	663	" And how far DO you dare ? "
28334	28357	28359	28359	Strether	82	" Well , she very far . I much less . I do n't begin to have her faith . She provides , "
28361	28382	28359	28359	Strether	82	" three fourths of that . And she provides , as I 've confided to you , ALL the money . "
28413	28423	28405	28405	she	663	" I hope then you make a good thing - "
28424	28432	28433	28433	he	82	" I NEVER made a good thing ! "
28442	28455	28438	28438	She	663	" Do n't you call it a good thing to be loved ? "
28456	28476	28477	28477	She	663	" Oh we 're not loved . We 're not even hated . We 're only just sweetly ignored . "
28482	28489	28490	28490	she	663	" You do n't trust me ! "
28495	28518	28490	28490	she	663	" Do n't I when I lift the last veil ? - tell you the very secret of the prison - house ? "
28540	28553	28520	28520	she	663	" You do n't sell ? Oh I 'm glad of THAT ! "
28569	28577	28564	28564	she	663	" She 's just a MORAL swell . "
28585	28595	28578	28578	He	82	" Yes - I really think that describes her . "
28606	28614	28615	28615	He	82	" How does she do her hair ? "
28619	28622	28615	28615	He	82	" Beautifully ! "
28623	28667	28668	28668	He	82	" Ah that does n't tell me . However , it does n't matter - I know . It 's tremendously neat - a real reproach ; quite remarkably thick and without , as yet , a single strand of white . There ! "
28680	28687	28668	28668	He	82	" You 're the very deuce . "
28688	28745	28757	28757	she	663	" What else SHOULD I be ? It was as the very deuce I pounced on you . But do n't let it trouble you , for everything but the very deuce - at our age - is a bore and a delusion , and even he himself , after all , but half a joy . "
28760	28778	28757	28757	she	663	" You assist her to expiate - which is rather hard when you 've yourself not sinned . "
28779	28788	28789	28789	Strether	82	" It 's she who has n't sinned , "
28792	28799	28789	28789	Strether	82	" I 've sinned the most . "
28800	28803	28804	28805	Miss Gostrey	99	" Ah , "
28809	28825	28804	28805	Miss Gostrey	99	" what a picture of HER ! Have you robbed the widow and the orphan ? "
28826	28832	28834	28834	Strether	82	" I 've sinned enough , "
28836	28845	28834	28834	Strether	82	" Enough for whom ? Enough for what ? "
28846	28855	28804	28805	Miss Gostrey	99	" Well , to be where I am . "
28856	28860	28834	28834	Strether	82	" Thank you ! "
28931	28941	28921	28921	her	99	" I knew you had something up your sleeve ! "
29147	29157	29125	29127	Strether 's comrade	678	" Does your young friend in Paris like you ? "
29169	29179	29125	29127	Strether 's comrade	678	" Oh I hope not ! Why SHOULD he ? "
29180	29186	29187	29188	Miss Gostrey	99	" Why should n't he ? "
29191	29207	29187	29188	Miss Gostrey	99	" That you 're coming down on him need have nothing to do with it . "
29208	29215	29216	29216	he	82	" You see more in it , "
29220	29223	29216	29216	he	82	" than I. "
29224	29233	29187	29188	Miss Gostrey	99	" Of course I see you in it . "
29234	29245	29187	29188	Miss Gostrey	99	" Well then you see more in ' me ' ! "
29246	29269	29270	29270	she	99	" Than you see in yourself ? Very likely . That 's always one 's right . What I was thinking of , "
29273	29285	29270	29270	she	99	" is the possible particular effect on him of his milieu . "
29286	29292	29187	29188	Miss Gostrey	99	" Oh his milieu - ! "
29307	29319	29296	29296	he	82	" Do you mean it can only have been so lowering ? "
29320	29330	29187	29188	Miss Gostrey	99	" Why that 's my very starting - point . "
29331	29347	29187	29188	Miss Gostrey	99	" Yes , but you start so far back . What do his letters say ? "
29348	29365	29296	29296	he	82	" Nothing . He practically ignores us - or spares us . He does n't write . "
29366	29377	29378	29378	she	99	" I see . But there are all the same , "
29382	29422	29378	29378	she	99	" two quite distinct things that - given the wonderful place he 's in - may have happened to him . One is that he may have got brutalised . The other is that he may have got refined . "
29431	29434	29296	29296	he	82	" Refined ? "
29435	29438	29439	29439	she	99	" Oh , "
29443	29448	29439	29439	she	99	" there ARE refinements . "
29466	29471	29439	29439	she	99	" YOU have them ! "
29472	29479	29480	29480	she	99	" As one of the signs , "
29487	29494	29480	29480	she	99	" they constitute perhaps the worst . "
29504	29517	29495	29495	He	82	" Is it a refinement not to answer his mother 's letters ? "
29531	29541	29526	29526	she	99	" Oh I should say the greatest of all . "
29542	29545	29547	29547	Strether	82	" Well , "
29549	29581	29547	29547	Strether	82	" I'M quite content to let it , as one of the signs , pass for the worst that I know he believes he can do what he likes with me . "
29588	29595	29526	29526	she	99	" How do you know it ? "
29596	29611	29526	29526	she	99	" Oh I 'm sure of it . I feel it in my bones . "
29612	29619	29526	29526	she	99	" Feel he CAN do it ? "
29620	29636	29637	29637	Strether	82	" Feel that he believes he can . It may come to the same thing ! "
29649	29664	29640	29640	She	99	" Nothing for you will ever come to the same thing as anything else . "
29681	29698	29669	29669	she	99	" You say that if he does break he 'll come in for things at home ? "
29699	29889	29890	29890	She	679	" Quite positively . He 'll come in for a particular chance - a chance that any properly constituted young man would jump at . The business has so developed that an opening scarcely apparent three years ago , but which his father 's will took account of as in certain conditions possible and which , under that will , attaches to Chad 's availing himself of it a large contingent advantage - this opening , the conditions having come about , now simply awaits him . His mother has kept it for him , holding out against strong pressure , till the last possible moment . It requires , naturally , as it carries with it a handsome ' part , ' a large share in profits , his being on the spot and making a big effort for a big result . That 's what I mean by his chance . If he misses it he comes in , as you say , for nothing . And to see that he does n't miss it is , in a word , what I 've come out for . "
29897	29914	29890	29890	She	679	" What you 've come out for then is simply to render him an immense service . "
29926	29932	29917	29918	poor Strether	82	" Ah if you like . "
29933	29950	29890	29890	She	679	" He stands , as they say , if you succeed with him , to gain - "
29951	29958	29959	29959	Strether	82	" Oh a lot of advantages . "
29969	29981	29959	29959	Strether	82	" By which you mean of course a lot of money . "
29982	30036	29890	29890	She	679	" Well , not only . I 'm acting with a sense for him of other things too . Consideration and comfort and security - the general safety of being anchored by a strong chain . He wants , as I see him , to be protected . Protected I mean from life . "
30037	30041	29890	29890	She	679	" Ah voila ! "
30050	30068	29890	29890	She	679	" From life . What you REALLY want to get him home for is to marry him . "
30069	30080	29890	29890	She	679	" Well , that 's about the size of it . "
30081	30085	30086	30086	she	679	" Of course , "
30089	30101	30086	30086	she	679	" it 's rudimentary . But to any one in particular ? "
30113	30119	30102	30102	He	82	" You get everything out . "
30128	30134	30135	30135	He	82	" You put everything in ! "
30143	30148	30135	30135	He	82	" To Mamie Pocock . "
30167	30172	30135	30135	He	82	" His own niece ? "
30173	30203	30149	30149	She	679	" Oh you must yourself find a name for the relation . His brother - in - law 's sister . Mrs. Jim 's sister - in - law . "
30216	30226	30209	30210	Miss Gostrey	99	" And who in the world 's Mrs. Jim ? "
30227	30252	30135	30135	He	82	" Chad 's sister - who was Sarah Newsome . She 's married - did n't I mention it ? - to Jim Pocock . "
30253	30257	30258	30258	she	679	" Ah yes , "
30281	30290	30291	30291	she	679	" Who in the world 's Jim Pocock ? "
30294	30311	30312	30312	he	681	" Why Sally 's husband . That 's the only way we distinguish people at Woollett , "
30318	30331	30332	30332	He	681	" And is it a great distinction - being Sally 's husband ? "
30335	30361	30332	30332	He	681	" I think there can be scarcely a greater - unless it may become one , in the future , to be Chad 's wife . "
30362	30370	30398	30398	she	679	" Then how do they distinguish YOU ? "
30371	30388	30332	30332	He	681	" They DON'T - except , as I 've told you , by the green cover . "
30404	30429	30398	30398	she	679	" The green cover wo n't - nor will ANY cover - avail you with ME . You 're of a depth of duplicity ! "
30445	30452	30432	30432	she	679	" Is Mamie a great parti ? "
30453	30465	30466	30467	Miss Gostrey	99	" Oh the greatest we have - our prettiest brightest girl . "
30475	30487	30466	30467	Miss Gostrey	99	" I know what they CAN be . And with money ? "
30488	30521	30522	30522	Strether	82	" Not perhaps with a great deal of that - but with so much of everything else that we do n't miss it . We DON'T miss money much , you know , "

30537	30540	30541	30541	she	679	" No , "
30544	30559	30560	30560	she	679	" but I know also what you do sometimes miss . And do you , "
30563	30568	30560	30560	she	679	" yourself admire her ? "
30596	30610	30587	30587	he	82	" Have n't I sufficiently showed you how I admire ANY pretty girl ? "
30636	30665	30629	30629	she	679	" I supposed that at Woollett you wanted them - what shall I call it ? - blameless . I mean your young men for your pretty girls . "
30666	30671	30672	30672	Strether	82	" So did I ! "
30675	30756	30672	30672	Strether	82	" But you strike there a curious fact - the fact that Woollett too accommodates itself to the spirit of the age and the increasing mildness of manners . Everything changes , and I hold that our situation precisely marks a date . We SHOULD prefer them blameless , but we have to make the best of them as we find them . Since the spirit of the age and the increasing mildness send them so much more to Paris - "
30757	30775	30829	30829	he	82	" You 've to take them back as they come . When they DO come . Bon ! "
30791	30795	30784	30784	she	684	" Poor Chad ! "
30796	30799	30801	30801	Strether	82	" Ah , "
30803	30809	30810	30810	She	684	" Mamie will save him ! "
30835	30847	30821	30821	she	684	" YOU'LL save him . That 's who 'll save him . "
30848	30861	30862	30862	he	82	" Oh but with Mamie 's aid . Unless indeed you mean , "
30865	30876	30862	30862	he	82	" that I shall effect so much more with yours ! "
30887	30907	30879	30879	her	684	" You 'll do more - as you 're so much better - than all of us put together . "
30908	30921	30922	30922	Strether	82	" I think I 'm only better since I 've known YOU ! "
30990	31021	30980	30980	she	684	" You 've spoken to me of what - by your success - Mr. Chad stands to gain . But you 've not spoken to me of what you do . "
31022	31031	31033	31033	Strether	82	" Oh I 've nothing more to gain , "
31046	31065	31037	31037	She	684	" You mean you 've got it all ' down ' ? You 've been paid in advance ? "
31066	31074	31075	31075	he	82	" Ah do n't talk about payment ! "
31106	31118	31099	31099	she	684	" What - by failure - do you stand to lose ? "
31129	31132	31133	31133	he	82	" Nothing ! "
31203	31212	31195	31195	he	82	" You wo n't take me with you ? "
31213	31219	31249	31249	She	684	" Not for the world . "
31220	31226	31195	31195	he	82	" Then I shall walk . "

31233	31239	31241	31241	Strether	82	" I like the rain , "
31243	31248	31241	31241	Strether	82	" Good - night ! "
31276	31284	31269	31269	she	684	" What do you stand to lose ? "

31312	31330	31269	31269	she	684	" So I thought . Then you shall succeed . And to that end I 'm yours - "
31331	31337	31338	31338	he	82	" Ah , dear lady ! "
31342	31346	31348	31349	Maria Gostrey	97	" Till death ! "

He had struck off the fancy that it might , as a preliminary , be of service to him to be seen , by a happy accident , from the third - story windows , which took all the March sun , but of what service was it to find himself making out after a moment that the quality ' sprung , "
39441	39444	39462	39462	he	82	" Oh , "
39448	39459	39462	39462	he	82	" I 've all sorts of things to tell you ! "
39554	39559	39541	39541	he	96	" Merci , Francois ! "

39980	40129	40130	40130	Waymarsh	96	" I found his friend in fact there keeping the place warm , as he called it , for him ; Chad himself being , as appears , in the south . He went a month ago to Cannes and though his return begins to be looked for it ca n't be for some days . I might , you see , perfectly have waited a week ; might have beaten a retreat as soon as I got this essential knowledge . But I beat no retreat ; I did the opposite ; I stayed , I dawdled , I trifled ; above all I looked round . I saw , in fine ; and - I do n't know what to call it - I sniffed . It 's a detail , but it 's as if there were something - something very good - TO sniff . "
40158	40168	40143	40144	the latter	504	" Do you mean a smell ? What of ? "
40169	40180	40181	40181	Waymarsh	96	" A charming scent . But I do n't know . "
40187	40196	40181	40181	Waymarsh	96	" Does he live there with a woman ? "
40197	40203	40204	40204	Waymarsh	96	" I do n't know . "
40214	40223	40204	40204	Waymarsh	96	" Has he taken her off with him ? "
40224	40232	40181	40181	Waymarsh	96	" And will he bring her back ? "
40248	40254	40257	40257	he	82	" I do n't know . "
40299	40308	40257	40257	he	82	" Then what the devil DO you know ? "
40309	40312	40314	40314	Strether	82	" Well , "
40318	40327	40314	40314	Strether	82	" I guess I do n't know anything ! "
40398	40410	40348	40348	him	82	" That 's what I found out from the young man . "
40411	40422	40348	40348	him	82	" But I thought you said you found out nothing . "
40423	40435	40348	40348	him	82	" Nothing but that - that I do n't know anything . "
40436	40445	40348	40348	him	82	" And what good does that do you ? "
40446	40451	40453	40453	Strether	82	" It 's just , "
40455	40508	40453	40453	Strether	82	" what I 've come to you to help me to discover . I mean anything about anything over here . I FELT that , up there . It regularly rose before me in its might . The young man moreover - Chad 's friend - as good as told me so . "
40509	40521	40522	40522	Waymarsh	96	" As good as told you you know nothing about anything ? "
40538	40544	40522	40522	Waymarsh	96	" How old is he ? "
40545	40553	40348	40348	him	82	" Well , I guess not thirty . "
40554	40564	40453	40453	Strether	82	" Yet you had to take that from him ? "
40565	40588	40522	40522	Waymarsh	96	" Oh I took a good deal more - since , as I tell you , I took an invitation to dejeuner . "
40589	40599	40348	40348	him	82	" And are you GOING to that unholy meal ? "
40600	40628	40629	40629	Strether	82	" If you 'll come with me . He wants you too , you know . I told him about you . He gave me his card , "
40632	40665	40629	40629	Strether	82	" and his name 's rather funny . It 's John Little Bilham , and he says his two surnames are , on account of his being small , inevitably used together . "
40666	40669	40670	40670	Waymarsh	96	" Well , "
40679	40687	40670	40670	Waymarsh	96	" what 's he doing up there ? "
40688	40781	40782	40782	Strether	82	" His account of himself is that he 's ' only a little artist - man . ' That seemed to me perfectly to describe him . But he 's yet in the phase of study ; this , you know , is the great art - school - to pass a certain number of years in which he came over . And he 's a great friend of Chad 's , and occupying Chad 's rooms just now because they 're so pleasant . HE 'S very pleasant and curious too , "
40785	40793	40782	40782	Strether	82	" though he 's not from Boston . "
40802	40808	40809	40809	Strether	82	" Where is he from ? "
40812	40838	40809	40809	Strether	82	" I do n't know that , either . But he 's ' notoriously , ' as he put it himself , not from Boston . "
40839	40842	40843	40843	Waymarsh	96	" Well , "
40849	40861	40862	40862	he	96	" every one ca n't notoriously be from Boston . Why , "
40865	40870	40862	40862	he	96	" is he curious ? "
40871	40884	40885	40885	Strether	82	" Perhaps just for THAT - for one thing ! But really , "
40888	40900	40885	40885	Strether	82	" for everything . When you meet him you 'll see . "
40901	40911	40912	40912	Waymarsh	96	" Oh I do n't want to meet him , "
40916	40924	40912	40912	Waymarsh	96	" Why do n't he go home ? "
40928	40938	40925	40925	Strether	82	" Well , because he likes it over here . "
40949	40975	40976	40976	Strether	82	" He ought then to be ashamed of himself , and , as you admit that you think so too , why drag him in ? "
40983	41035	41036	41036	He	82	" Perhaps I do think so myself - though I do n't quite yet admit it . I 'm not a bit sure - it 's again one of the things I want to find out . I liked him , and CAN you like people - ? But no matter . "
41041	41058	41036	41036	He	82	" There 's no doubt I want you to come down on me and squash me . "
41106	41116	41036	41036	He	82	" Have they got a handsome place up there ? "
41117	41136	41139	41139	Strether	82	" Oh a charming place ; full of beautiful and valuable things . I never saw such a place "
41147	41156	41157	41157	He	82	" For a little artist - man - ! "
41179	41182	41166	41167	his companion	388	" Well ? "
41183	41204	41139	41139	Strether	82	" Well , life can hold nothing better . Besides , they 're things of which he 's in charge . "
41205	41219	41220	41220	Waymarsh	96	" So that he does doorkeeper for your precious pair ? Can life , "
41223	41230	41220	41220	Waymarsh	96	" hold nothing better than THAT ? "
41243	41252	41253	41253	he	96	" Does n't he know what SHE is ? "
41257	41294	41253	41253	he	96	" I do n't know . I did n't ask him . I could n't . It was impossible . You would n't either . Besides I did n't want to . No more would you . "
41304	41317	41295	41295	Strether	82	" You ca n't make out over here what people do know . "
41318	41327	41253	41253	he	96	" Then what did you come over for ? "
41328	41343	41253	41253	he	96	" Well , I suppose exactly to see for myself - without their aid . "
41344	41353	41295	41295	Strether	82	" Then what do you want mine for ? "
41354	41357	41358	41358	Strether	82	" Oh , "
41361	41376	41358	41358	Strether	82	" you 're not one of THEM ! I do know what you know . "
41420	41429	41416	41416	Waymarsh	96	" Look here , Strether . Quit this . "
41440	41447	41437	41437	his	235	" Do you mean my tone ? "
41448	41500	41416	41416	Waymarsh	96	" No - damn your tone . I mean your nosing round . Quit the whole job . Let them stew in their juice . You 're being used for a thing you ai n't fit for . People do n't take a fine - tooth comb to groom a horse . "
41501	41510	41511	41511	Strether	82	" Am I a fine - tooth comb ? "
41514	41523	41511	41511	Strether	82	" It 's something I never called myself ! "
41524	41551	41552	41552	He	82	" It 's what you are , all the same . You ai n't so young as you were , but you 've kept your teeth . "
41559	41582	41583	41583	he	82	" Take care I do n't get them into YOU ! You 'd like them , my friends at home , Waymarsh , "
41586	41597	41605	41605	he	82	" you 'd really particularly like them . And I know "
41613	41621	41605	41605	he	82	" I know they 'd like you ! "
41622	41632	41633	41633	Waymarsh	96	" Oh do n't work them off on ME ! "
41647	41664	41637	41637	Strether	82	" It 's really quite as indispensable as I say that Chad should be got back . "
41665	41673	41633	41633	Waymarsh	96	" Indispensable to whom ? To you ? "
41674	41677	41678	41678	Strether	82	" Yes , "
41682	41694	41678	41678	Strether	82	" Because if you get him you also get Mrs. Newsome ? "
41699	41702	41695	41695	Strether	82	" Yes . "
41703	41717	41724	41724	he	82	" And if you do n't get him you do n't get her ? "
41730	41762	41724	41724	he	82	" I think it might have some effect on our personal understanding . Chad 's of real importance - or can easily become so if he will - to the business . "
41763	41777	41633	41633	Waymarsh	96	" And the business is of real importance to his mother 's husband ? "
41778	41806	41695	41695	Strether	82	" Well , I naturally want what my future wife wants . And the thing will be much better if we have our own man in it . "
41807	41821	41822	41822	Waymarsh	96	" If you have your own man in it , in other words , "
41825	41869	41822	41822	Waymarsh	96	" you 'll marry - you personally - more money . She 's already rich , as I understand you , but she 'll be richer still if the business can be made to boom on certain lines that you 've laid down . "
41870	41878	41879	41879	Strether	82	" I have n't laid them down , "
41883	41903	41879	41879	Strether	82	" Mr. Newsome - who knew extraordinarily well what he was about - laid them down ten years ago . "
41923	41932	41915	41915	his	96	" You 're fierce for the boom anyway . "
41946	41985	41986	41986	Waymarsh	96	" I can scarcely be called fierce , I think , when I so freely take my chance of the possibility , the danger , of being influenced in a sense counter to Mrs. Newsome 's own feelings . "
41995	42013	42014	42014	he	96	" I see . You 're afraid yourself of being squared . But you 're a humbug , "
42017	42022	42014	42014	he	96	" all the same . "
42023	42026	42027	42027	Strether	82	" Oh ! "
42031	42062	42027	42027	Strether	82	" Yes , you ask me for protection - which makes you very interesting ; and then you wo n't take it . You say you want to be squashed - "
42063	42075	42076	42076	Strether	82	" Ah but not so easily ! Do n't you see , "
42078	42129	42076	42076	Strether	82	" where my interest , as already shown you , lies ? It lies in my not being squared . If I 'm squared where 's my marriage ? If I miss my errand I miss that ; and if I miss that I miss everything - I 'm nowhere . "
42140	42153	42130	42130	Waymarsh	96	" What do I care where you are if you 're spoiled ? "
42162	42167	42168	42168	Strether	82	" Thank you awfully , "
42173	42185	42168	42168	Strether	82	" But do n't you think HER judgement of that - ? "
42186	42194	42168	42168	Strether	82	" Ought to content me ? No . "
42214	42230	42210	42210	Strether	82	" You do her injustice . You really MUST know her . Good - night . "

The Hebrew prophet , Ezekiel , Jeremiah , who used when I was a little girl in the Rue Montaigne to come to see my father and who was usually the American Minister to the Tuileries or some other court . I have n't seen one these ever so many years ; the sight of it warms my poor old chilled heart ; this specimen is wonderful ; in the right quarter , you know , he 'll have a succes fou . "
43168	43190	43191	43191	He	82	" Oh the artist - quarter and that kind of thing ; HERE already , for instance , as you see . "

45038	45061	45076	45076	she	977	" Ah that sort of thing was of the essence of your case and to have been allowed for from the first . "

45181	45234	45176	45177	Miss Gostrey	99	" Never in the world ! We escape that with a perfection - ! I feel it to be largely , no doubt , because I do n't half - understand him ; but our modus vivendi is n't spoiled even by that . You must dine with me to meet him , "
45239	45246	45176	45177	Miss Gostrey	99	" Then you 'll see . ' "
45252	45253	45248	45248	you	82	" "
45266	45272	45263	45263	I	0	" All her kindness wondered . "
45281	45282	45274	45274	you	82	" "
45307	45315	45301	45301	I	0	" She thought again - she laughed . "
45340	45354	45328	45328	I	0	" He looked for a moment as if she were really failing him . "
45362	45379	45356	45356	you	82	" It was almost as if she had developed an unexpected personal prudence . She hesitated . "
45386	45387	45389	45390	little Bilham	83	" "
45395	45405	45389	45390	little Bilham	83	" He kept back for the moment Miss Barrace . "
45418	45419	45407	45407	Chad	111	" "
45426	45427	45423	45423	he	111	" "
45448	45452	45444	45444	Bilham	83	" he pursued , "
45484	45485	45470	45470	I	0	" "
45495	45501	45487	45487	you	82	" She was perfectly easy . "
45512	45513	45514	45514	Ah	983	" "
45520	45524	45516	45516	I	0	" said Strether , "
45529	45535	45516	45516	I	0	" She turned it over . "
45548	45564	45538	45538	you	0	" He let her , with this , however ruefully , have the whole truth . "
45574	45575	45565	45565	I	0	" "
45585	45586	45565	45565	I	0	" "
45595	45601	45590	45590	I	0	" Strether took a moment . "
45613	45614	45610	45610	I	0	" "
45618	45668	45610	45610	I	0	" - and her laughter spread . He was struck in fact by the effect on her of his joke . He saw now how he meant it as a joke . SHE saw , however , still other things , though in an instant she had hidden them . "
45678	45685	45669	45669	You	0	" He tried to muster them . "
45694	45695	45669	45669	You	0	" "
45702	45707	45669	45669	You	0	" she quickly returned , "
45740	45741	45718	45718	They	985	" "
45761	45762	45757	45757	I	0	" "
45775	45779	45765	45765	you	0	" she replied , "
45787	45795	45796	45796	You	0	" With which she smiled at him . "
45802	45803	45796	45796	You	0	" "
45824	45825	45826	45826	They	985	" "
45829	45834	45826	45826	They	985	" said Miss Gostrey . "
45843	45847	45840	45840	you	0	" she added , "
45861	45891	45852	45852	They	985	" To have got at something comparatively definite appeared at last a little to help - a wave by which moreover , the next moment , recollection was washed . "
45907	45908	45892	45894	My young man	988	" "
45916	45922	45913	45913	he	988	" Strether more exactly recalled . "
45928	45929	45913	45913	he	988	" "
45936	45962	45913	45913	he	988	" He had bent , with neared glasses , over a group of articles on a small stand ; and at this he came up . "
45999	46000	45995	45995	Bilham	83	" "
46011	46027	45995	45995	Bilham	83	" - and Miss Gostrey turned them over . She seemed , however , satisfied . "
46036	46053	46062	46062	they	990	" He glanced once more at a bibelot or two , and everything sent him back . "
46073	46077	46062	46062	they	990	" She wondered . "
46081	46082	46062	46062	they	990	" "
46105	46106	46092	46092	They	990	" "
46109	46113	46092	46092	They	990	" she answered , "
46125	46130	46132	46132	myself	0	" she went on , "
46173	46178	46170	46171	Mr. Chad	111	" she immediately pursued , "
46203	46204	46207	46207	they	991	" "
46209	46222	46207	46207	they	991	" Strether asked with an interest in decent men that amused her . "
46283	46284	46276	46276	She	994	" "
46289	46296	46276	46276	She	994	" Strether confessed in his weakness , "
46301	46486	46276	46276	She	994	" There seemed much in what she said , but he was able after a little to help her to a nearer impression . The meeting with little Bilham took place , by easy arrangement , in the great gallery of the Louvre ; and when , standing with his fellow visitor before one of the splendid Titians - the overwhelming portrait of the young man with the strangely - shaped glove and the blue - grey eyes - he turned to see the third member of their party advance from the end of the waxed and gilded vista , he had a sense of having at last taken hold . He had agreed with Miss Gostrey - it dated even from Chester - for a morning at the Louvre , and he had embraced independently the same idea as thrown out by little Bilham , whom he had already accompanied to the museum of the Luxembourg . The fusion of these schemes presented no difficulty , and it was to strike him again that in little Bilham 's company contrarieties in general dropped . "
46499	47261	46493	46493	he	995	" Miss Gostrey , after the first exchange , soon found a chance to murmur to her companion ; and Strether , as they proceeded and paused and while a quick unanimity between the two appeared to have phrased itself in half a dozen remarks - Strether knew that he knew almost immediately what she meant , and took it as still another sign that he had got his job in hand . This was the more grateful to him that he could think of the intelligence now serving him as an acquisition positively new . He would n't have known even the day before what she meant - that is if she meant , what he assumed , that they were intense Americans together . He had just worked round - and with a sharper turn of the screw than any yet - to the conception of an American intense as little Bilham was intense . The young man was his first specimen ; the specimen had profoundly perplexed him ; at present however there was light . It was by little Bilham 's amazing serenity that he had at first been affected , but he had inevitably , in his circumspection , felt it as the trail of the serpent , the corruption , as he might conveniently have said , of Europe ; whereas the promptness with which it came up for Miss Gostrey but as a special little form of the oldest thing they knew justified it at once to his own vision as well . He wanted to be able to like his specimen with a clear good conscience , and this fully permitted it . What had muddled him was precisely the small artist - man 's way - it was so complete - of being more American than anybody . But it now for the time put Strether vastly at his ease to have this view of a new way . The amiable youth then looked out , as it had first struck Strether , at a world in respect to which he had n't a prejudice . The one our friend most instantly missed was the usual one in favour of an occupation accepted . Little Bilham had an occupation , but it was only an occupation declined ; and it was by his general exemption from alarm , anxiety or remorse on this score that the impression of his serenity was made . He had come out to Paris to paint - to fathom , that is , at large , that mystery ; but study had been fatal to him so far as anything COULD be fatal , and his productive power faltered in proportion as his knowledge grew . Strether had gathered from him that at the moment of his finding him in Chad 's rooms he had n't saved from his shipwreck a scrap of anything but his beautiful intelligence and his confirmed habit of Paris . He referred to these things with an equal fond familiarity , and it was sufficiently clear that , as an outfit , they still served him . They were charming to Strether through the hour spent at the Louvre , where indeed they figured for him as an unseparated part of the charged iridescent air , the glamour of the name , the splendour of the space , the colour of the masters . Yet they were present too wherever the young man led , and the day after the visit to the Louvre they hung , in a different walk , about the steps of our party . He had invited his companions to cross the river with him , offering to show them his own poor place ; and his own poor place , which was very poor , gave to his idiosyncrasies , for Strether - the small sublime indifference and independences that had struck the latter as fresh - an odd and engaging dignity . He lived at the end of an alley that went out of an old short cobbled street , a street that went in turn out of a new long smooth avenue - street and avenue and alley having , however , in common a sort of social shabbiness ; and he introduced them to the rather cold and blank little studio which he had lent to a comrade for the term of his elegant absence . The comrade was another ingenuous compatriot , to whom he had wired that tea was to await them "
47264	48241	48242	48242	He	998	" and this reckless repast , and the second ingenuous compatriot , and the faraway makeshift life , with its jokes and its gaps , its delicate daubs and its three or four chairs , its overflow of taste and conviction and its lack of nearly all else - these things wove round the occasion a spell to which our hero unreservedly surrendered . He liked the ingenuous compatriots - for two or three others soon gathered ; he liked the delicate daubs and the free discriminations - involving references indeed , involving enthusiasms and execrations that made him , as they said , sit up ; he liked above all the legend of good - humoured poverty , of mutual accommodation fairly raised to the romantic , that he soon read into the scene . The ingenuous compatriots showed a candour , he thought , surpassing even the candour of Woollett ; they were red - haired and long - legged , they were quaint and queer and dear and droll ; they made the place resound with the vernacular , which he had never known so marked as when figuring for the chosen language , he must suppose , of contemporary art . They twanged with a vengeance the aesthetic lyre - they drew from it wonderful airs . This aspect of their life had an admirable innocence ; and he looked on occasion at Maria Gostrey to see to what extent that element reached her . She gave him however for the hour , as she had given him the previous day , no further sign than to show how she dealt with boys ; meeting them with the air of old Parisian practice that she had for every one , for everything , in turn . Wonderful about the delicate daubs , masterful about the way to make tea , trustful about the legs of chairs and familiarly reminiscent of those , in the other time , the named , the numbered or the caricatured , who had flourished or failed , disappeared or arrived , she had accepted with the best grace her second course of little Bilham , and had said to Strether , the previous afternoon on his leaving them , that , since her impression was to be renewed , she would reserve judgement till after the new evidence . The new evidence was to come , as it proved , in a day or two . He soon had from Maria a message to the effect that an excellent box at the Francais had been lent her for the following night ; it seeming on such occasions not the least of her merits that she was subject to such approaches . The sense of how she was always paying for something in advance was equalled on Strether 's part only by the sense of how she was always being paid ; all of which made for his consciousness , in the larger air , of a lively bustling traffic , the exchange of such values as were not for him to handle . She hated , he knew , at the French play , anything but a box - just as she hated at the English anything but a stall ; and a box was what he was already in this phase girding himself to press upon her . But she had for that matter her community with little Bilham : she too always , on the great issues , showed as having known in time . It made her constantly beforehand with him and gave him mainly the chance to ask himself how on the day of their settlement their account would stand . He endeavoured even now to keep it a little straight by arranging that if he accepted her invitation she should dine with him first ; but the upshot of this scruple was that at eight o'clock on the morrow he awaited her with Waymarsh under the pillared portico . She had n't dined with him , and it was characteristic of their relation that she had made him embrace her refusal without in the least understanding it . She ever caused her rearrangements to affect him as her tenderest touches . It was on that principle for instance that , giving him the opportunity to be amiable again to little Bilham , she had suggested his offering the young man a seat in their box . Strether had dispatched for this purpose a small blue missive to the Boulevard Malesherbes , but up to the moment of their passing into the theatre he had received no response to his message . He held , however , even after they had been for some time conveniently seated , that their friend , who knew his way about , would come in at his own right moment . His temporary absence moreover seemed , as never yet , to make the right moment for Miss Gostrey . Strether had been waiting till tonight to get back from her in some mirrored form her impressions and conclusions . She had elected , as they said , to see little Bilham once ; but now she had seen him twice and had nevertheless not said more than a word . Waymarsh meanwhile sat opposite him with their hostess between ; and Miss Gostrey spoke of herself as an instructor of youth introducing her little charges to a work that was one of the glories of literature . The glory was happily unobjectionable , and the little charges were candid ; for herself she had travelled that road and she merely waited on their innocence . But she referred in due time to their absent friend , whom it was clear they should have to give up . "
48251	48255	48257	48257	you	998	" she said , "
48294	48339	48284	48285	a man	572	" She spoke as if , with her look , it might have been Waymarsh who had written to the youth , and the latter 's face showed a mixture of austerity and anguish . She went on however as if to meet this . "
48354	48355	48340	48340	He	998	" "
48363	48364	48340	48340	He	998	" "
48452	48460	48461	48461	He	83	" She continued to talk to Waymarsh . "
48487	48488	48489	48489	I	0	" "
48496	48503	48493	48493	Waymarsh	96	" Strether said after a moment , "
48514	48515	48493	48493	Waymarsh	96	" "
48524	48530	48493	48493	Waymarsh	96	" Waymarsh lucidly enough replied ; "
48547	48548	48537	48539	the young man	2833	" "
48551	48556	48537	48539	the young man	2833	" Miss Gostrey sighed , "
48640	48644	48633	48633	I	0	" she pursued , "
48674	48682	48683	48684	little Bilham	83	" - she now took in Strether ; "
48698	48707	48694	48695	little Bilham	83	" Then she was all again for Waymarsh . "
48898	49134	48895	48895	him	83	" She had wound up with a laugh of enjoyment over her embroidery of her idea - an enjoyment that her face communicated to Strether , who almost wished none the less at this moment that she would let poor Waymarsh alone . HE knew more or less what she meant ; but the fact was n't a reason for her not pretending to Waymarsh that he did n't . It was craven of him perhaps , but he would , for the high amenity of the occasion , have liked Waymarsh not to be so sure of his wit . Her recognition of it gave him away and , before she had done with him or with that article , would give him worse . What was he , all the same , to do ? He looked across the box at his friend ; their eyes met ; something queer and stiff , something that bore on the situation but that it was better not to touch , passed in silence between them . Well , the effect of it for Strether was an abrupt reaction , a final impatience of his own tendency to temporise . Where was that taking him anyway ? It was one of the quiet instants that sometimes settle more matters than the outbreaks dear to the historic muse . The only qualification of the quietness was the synthetic "
49139	49201	48895	48895	him	83	" into which Strether 's share of the silence soundlessly flowered . It represented , this mute ejaculation , a final impulse to burn his ships . These ships , to the historic muse , may seem of course mere cockles , but when he presently spoke to Miss Gostrey it was with the sense at least of applying the torch . "
49208	49209	48895	48895	him	83	" "
49230	49235	49218	49218	I	0	" she presently replied ; "
49268	49292	49265	49265	my	0	" And she looked at him at last as if , little material as she yet gave him , he 'd really understand . "
49310	49311	49301	49301	He	1026	" "
49321	49325	49301	49301	He	1026	" Strether wondered . "
49337	49338	49339	49339	They	1028	" "
49344	49349	49339	49339	They	1028	" she portentously answered . "
49357	49358	49359	49359	They	1028	" "
49364	49401	49359	49359	They	1028	" she merely repeated . Though she disclaimed the prophetic vision she was at this instant the nearest approach he had ever met to the priestess of the oracle . The light was in her eyes . "
49408	49416	49417	49417	They	1028	" He faced it on the spot . "
49422	49423	49417	49417	They	1028	" "
49449	49457	49443	49443	his	1026	" It made Strether open his eyes . "
49463	49464	49459	49459	you	1027	" "
49529	49530	49516	49516	He	1026	" "
49540	49541	49533	49533	Chad	111	" "
49563	49564	49555	49555	You	1027	" "
49569	49573	49555	49555	You	1027	" Strether mused . "
49578	49601	49555	49555	You	1027	" she seemed to explain . But there was more , and , with one of her turns , she risked it . "
49609	49613	49607	49607	You	96	" she declared , "
49622	49627	49607	49607	You	96	" He sat massive . "
49636	49637	49607	49607	You	96	" "
49663	49664	49653	49653	your	96	" "
49672	49681	49670	49670	he	235	" She passed it on with a laugh . "
49691	49704	49683	49684	the devil	1032	" He spoke as if he had just been thinking it out . "
49718	49728	49683	49684	the devil	1032	" And he had had with this another thought . "
49767	49768	49761	49761	Chad	111	" "
49771	49780	49761	49761	Chad	111	" she asked while the image held him . "
49794	49795	49784	49784	Chad	111	" "
49810	49814	49806	49806	you	82	" she said , "
49842	49852	49837	49837	he	111	" This already sounded almost like a hope destroyed . "
49858	49859	49837	49837	he	111	" "
49867	50065	49837	49837	he	111	" But quite as she spoke she turned , and Strether turned ; for the door of the box had opened , with the click of the ouvreuse , from the lobby , and a gentleman , a stranger to them , had come in with a quick step . The door closed behind him , and , though their faces showed him his mistake , his air , which was striking , was all good confidence . The curtain had just again arisen , and , in the hush of the general attention , Strether 's challenge was tacit , as was also the greeting , with a quickly deprecating hand and smile , of the unannounced visitor . He discreetly signed that he would wait , would stand , and these things and his face , one look from which she had caught , had suddenly worked for Miss Gostrey . She fitted to them all an answer for Strether 's last question . The solid stranger was simply the answer - as she now , turning to her friend , indicated . She brought it straight out for him - it presented the intruder . "
50072	51167	50069	50070	this gentleman	1034	" The gentleman indeed , at the same time , though sounding for Strether a very short name , did practically as much to explain . Strether gasped the name back - then only had he seen Miss Gostrey had said more than she knew . They were in presence of Chad himself . Our friend was to go over it afterwards again and again - he was going over it much of the time that they were together , and they were together constantly for three or four days : the note had been so strongly struck during that first half - hour that everything happening since was comparatively a minor development . The fact was that his perception of the young man 's identity - so absolutely checked for a minute - had been quite one of the sensations that count in life ; he certainly had never known one that had acted , as he might have said , with more of a crowded rush . And the rush though both vague and multitudinous , had lasted a long time , protected , as it were , yet at the same time aggravated , by the circumstance of its coinciding with a stretch of decorous silence . They could n't talk without disturbing the spectators in the part of the balcony just below them ; and it , for that matter , came to Strether - being a thing of the sort that did come to him - that these were the accidents of a high civilisation ; the imposed tribute to propriety , the frequent exposure to conditions , usually brilliant , in which relief has to await its time . Relief was never quite near at hand for kings , queens , comedians and other such people , and though you might be yourself not exactly one of those , you could yet , in leading the life of high pressure , guess a little how they sometimes felt . It was truly the life of high pressure that Strether had seemed to feel himself lead while he sat there , close to Chad , during the long tension of the act . He was in presence of a fact that occupied his whole mind , that occupied for the half - hour his senses themselves all together ; but he could n't without inconvenience show anything - which moreover might count really as luck . What he might have shown , had he shown at all , was exactly the kind of emotion - the emotion of bewilderment - that he had proposed to himself from the first , whatever should occur , to show least . The phenomenon that had suddenly sat down there with him was a phenomenon of change so complete that his imagination , which had worked so beforehand , felt itself , in the connexion , without margin or allowance . It had faced every contingency but that Chad should not BE Chad , and this was what it now had to face with a mere strained smile and an uncomfortable flush . He asked himself if , by any chance , before he should have in some way to commit himself , he might feel his mind settled to the new vision , might habituate it , so to speak , to the remarkable truth . But oh it was too remarkable , the truth ; for what could be more remarkable than this sharp rupture of an identity ? You could deal with a man as himself - you could n't deal with him as somebody else . It was a small source of peace moreover to be reduced to wondering how little he might know in such an event what a sum he was setting you . He could n't absolutely not know , for you could n't absolutely not let him . It was a CASE then simply , a strong case , as people nowadays called such things , ' a case of transformation unsurpassed , and the hope was but in the general law that strong cases were liable to control from without . Perhaps he , Strether himself , was the only person after all aware of it . Even Miss Gostrey , with all her science , would n't be , would she ? - and he had never seen any one less aware of anything than Waymarsh as he glowered at Chad . The social sightlessness of his old friend 's survey marked for him afresh , and almost in an humiliating way , the inevitable limits of direct aid from this source . He was not certain , however , of not drawing a shade of compensation from the privilege , as yet untasted , of knowing more about something in particular than Miss Gostrey did . His situation too was a case , for that matter , and he was now so interested , quite so privately agog , about it , that he had already an eye to the fun it would be to open up to her afterwards . He derived during his half - hour no assistance from her , and just this fact of her not meeting his eyes played a little , it must be confessed , into his predicament . He had introduced Chad , in the first minutes , under his breath , and there was never the primness in her of the person unacquainted ; but she had none the less betrayed at first no vision but of the stage , where she occasionally found a pretext for an appreciative moment that she invited Waymarsh to share . The latter 's faculty of participation had never had , all round , such an assault to meet ; the pressure on him being the sharper for this chosen attitude in her , as Strether judged it , of isolating , for their natural intercourse , Chad and himself . This intercourse was meanwhile restricted to a frank friendly look from the young man , something markedly like a smile , but falling far short of a grin , and to the vivacity of Strether 's private speculation as to whether HE carried himself like a fool . He did n't quite see how he could so feel as one without somehow showing as one . The worst of that question moreover was that he knew it as a symptom the sense of which annoyed him . "
51184	51188	50069	50070	this gentleman	1034	" he reflected , "
51208	52243	51205	51205	I	0	" This sage consideration too , distinctly , seemed to leave untouched the fact that he WAS going to be conscious . He was conscious of everything but of what would have served him . He was to know afterwards , in the watches of the night , that nothing would have been more open to him than after a minute or two to propose to Chad to seek with him the refuge of the lobby . He had n't only not proposed it , but had lacked even the presence of mind to see it as possible . He had stuck there like a schoolboy wishing not to miss a minute of the show ; though for that portion of the show then presented he had n't had an instant 's real attention . He could n't when the curtain fell have given the slightest account of what had happened . He had therefore , further , not at that moment acknowledged the amenity added by this acceptance of his awkwardness to Chad 's general patience . Had n't he none the less known at the very time - known it stupidly and without reaction - that the boy was accepting something ? He was modestly benevolent , the boy - that was at least what he had been capable of the superiority of making out his chance to be ; and one had one 's self literally not had the gumption to get in ahead of him . If we should go into all that occupied our friend in the watches of the night we should have to mend our pen ; but an instance or two may mark for us the vividness with which he could remember . He remembered the two absurdities that , if his presence of mind HAD failed , were the things that had had most to do with it . He had never in his life seen a young man come into a box at ten o'clock at night , and would , if challenged on the question in advance , have scarce been ready to pronounce as to different ways of doing so . But it was in spite of this definite to him that Chad had had a way that was wonderful : a fact carrying with it an implication that , as one might imagine it , he knew , he had learned , how . Here already then were abounding results ; he had on the spot and without the least trouble of intention taught Strether that even in so small a thing as that there were different ways . He had done in the same line still more than this ; had by a mere shake or two of the head made his old friend observe that the change in him was perhaps more than anything else , for the eye , a matter of the marked streaks of grey , extraordinary at his age , in his thick black hair ; as well as that this new feature was curiously becoming to him , did something for him , as characterisation , also even - of all things in the world - as refinement , that had been a good deal wanted . Strether felt , however , he would have had to confess , that it would n't have been easy just now , on this and other counts , in the presence of what had been supplied , to be quite clear as to what had been missed . A reflexion a candid critic might have made of old , for instance , was that it would have been happier for the son to look more like the mother ; but this was a reflexion that at present would never occur . The ground had quite fallen away from it , yet no resemblance whatever to the mother had supervened . It would have been hard for a young man 's face and air to disconnect themselves more completely than Chad 's at this juncture from any discerned , from any imaginable aspect of a New England female parent . That of course was no more than had been on the cards ; but it produced in Strether none the less one of those frequent phenomena of mental reference with which all judgement in him was actually beset . Again and again as the days passed he had had a sense of the pertinence of communicating quickly with Woollett - communicating with a quickness with which telegraphy alone would rhyme ; the fruit really of a fine fancy in him for keeping things straight , for the happy forestalment of error . No one could explain better when needful , nor put more conscience into an account or a report ; which burden of conscience is perhaps exactly the reason why his heart always sank when the clouds of explanation gathered . His highest ingenuity was in keeping the sky of life clear of them . Whether or no he had a grand idea of the lucid , he held that nothing ever was in fact - for any one else - explained . One went through the vain motions , but it was mostly a waste of life . A personal relation was a relation only so long as people either perfectly understood or , better still , did n't care if they did n't . From the moment they cared if they did n't it was living by the sweat of one 's brow ; and the sweat of one 's brow was just what one might buy one 's self off from by keeping the ground free of the wild weed of delusion . It easily grew too fast , and the Atlantic cable now alone could race with it . That agency would each day have testified for him to something that was not what Woollett had argued . He was not at this moment absolutely sure that the effect of the morrow 's - or rather of the night 's - appreciation of the crisis would n't be to determine some brief missive . "
52254	52299	52248	52248	him	1036	" - some temporary relief of that sort seemed to hover before him . It hovered somehow as preparing them all - yet preparing them for what ? If he might do so more luminously and cheaply he would tick out in four words : "
52306	52354	52248	52248	him	1036	" To this particular item in Chad 's appearance he constantly , during their mute half - hour , reverted ; as if so very much more than he could have said had been involved in it . The most he could have said would have been : "
52366	52919	52356	52356	he	1036	" which indeed , however , carried with it quite enough . If Strether was to feel young , that is , it would be because Chad was to feel old ; and an aged and hoary sinner had been no part of the scheme . The question of Chadwick 's true time of life was , doubtless , what came up quickest after the adjournment of the two , when the play was over , to a cafe in the Avenue de l'Opera . Miss Gostrey had in due course been perfect for such a step ; she had known exactly what they wanted - to go straight somewhere and talk ; and Strether had even felt she had known what he wished to say and that he was arranging immediately to begin . She had n't pretended this , as she HAD pretended on the other hand , to have divined Waymarsh 's wish to extend to her an independent protection homeward ; but Strether nevertheless found how , after he had Chad opposite to him at a small table in the brilliant halls that his companion straightway selected , sharply and easily discriminated from others , it was quite , to his mind , as if she heard him speak ; as if , sitting up , a mile away , in the little apartment he knew , she would listen hard enough to catch . He found too that he liked that idea , and he wished that , by the same token , Mrs. Newsome might have caught as well . For what had above all been determined in him as a necessity of the first order was not to lose another hour , nor a fraction of one ; was to advance , to overwhelm , with a rush . This was how he would anticipate - by a night - attack , as might be - any forced maturity that a crammed consciousness of Paris was likely to take upon itself to assert on behalf of the boy . He knew to the full , on what he had just extracted from Miss Gostrey , Chad 's marks of alertness ; but they were a reason the more for not dawdling . If he was himself moreover to be treated as young he would n't at all events be so treated before he should have struck out at least once . His arms might be pinioned afterwards , but it would have been left on record that he was fifty . The importance of this he had indeed begun to feel before they left the theatre ; it had become a wild unrest , urging him to seize his chance . He could scarcely wait for it as they went ; he was on the verge of the indecency of bringing up the question in the street ; he fairly caught himself going on - so he afterwards invidiously named it - as if there would be for him no second chance should the present be lost . Not till , on the purple divan before the perfunctory bock , he had brought out the words themselves , was he sure , for that matter , that the present would be saved . Book Fourth I "
52959	53128	52920	52920	I	0	" - Strether , face to face with Chad after the play , had sounded these words almost breathlessly , and with an effect at first positively disconcerting to himself alone . For Chad 's receptive attitude was that of a person who had been gracefully quiet while the messenger at last reaching him has run a mile through the dust . During some seconds after he had spoken Strether felt as if HE had made some such exertion ; he was not even certain that the perspiration was n't on his brow . It was the kind of consciousness for which he had to thank the look that , while the strain lasted , the young man 's eyes gave him . They reflected - and the deuce of the thing was that they reflected really with a sort of shyness of kindness - his momentarily disordered state ; which fact brought on in its turn for our friend the dawn of a fear that Chad might simply "
53132	53198	52920	52920	I	0	" - take everything out - in being sorry for him . Such a fear , any fear , was unpleasant . But everything was unpleasant ; it was odd how everything had suddenly turned so . This however was no reason for letting the least thing go . Strether had the next minute proceeded as roundly as if with an advantage to follow up . "
53528	53529	53518	53518	I	0	" "
53537	53573	53531	53531	I	0	" Strether was to recall that Chad had at this point enquired . He was likewise to recall - and it had to count for some time as his greatest comfort - that it had been "
53575	53592	53593	53593	I	0	" him , as they said at Woollett , to reply with some presence of mind : "
53600	54215	53593	53593	I	0	" He was really for a while to like thinking he had been positively hard . On the point of conceding that Chad had improved in appearance , but that to the question of appearance the remark must be confined , he checked even that compromise and left his reservation bare . Not only his moral , but also , as it were , his aesthetic sense had a little to pay for this , Chad being unmistakeably - and was n't it a matter of the confounded grey hair again ? - handsomer than he had ever promised . That however fell in perfectly with what Strether had said . They had no desire to keep down his proper expansion , and he would n't be less to their purpose for not looking , as he had too often done of old , only bold and wild . There was indeed a signal particular in which he would distinctly be more so . Strether did n't , as he talked , absolutely follow himself ; he only knew he was clutching his thread and that he held it from moment to moment a little tighter ; his mere uninterruptedness during the few minutes helped him to do that . He had frequently for a month , turned over what he should say on this very occasion , and he seemed at last to have said nothing he had thought of - everything was so totally different . But in spite of all he had put the flag at the window . This was what he had done , and there was a minute during which he affected himself as having shaken it hard , flapped it with a mighty flutter , straight in front of his companion 's nose . It gave him really almost the sense of having already acted his part . The momentary relief - as if from the knowledge that nothing of THAT at least could be undone - sprang from a particular cause , the cause that had flashed into operation , in Miss Gostrey 's box , with direct apprehension , with amazed recognition , and that had been concerned since then in every throb of his consciousness . What it came to was that with an absolutely new quantity to deal with one simply could n't know . The new quantity was represented by the fact that Chad had been made over . That was all ; whatever it was it was everything . Strether had never seen the thing so done before - it was perhaps a speciality of Paris . If one had been present at the process one might little by little have mastered the result ; but he was face to face , as matters stood , with the finished business . It had freely been noted for him that he might be received as a dog among skittles , but that was on the basis of the old quantity . He had originally thought of lines and tones as things to be taken , but these possibilities had now quite melted away . There was no computing at all what the young man before him would think or feel or say on any subject whatever . This intelligence Strether had afterwards , to account for his nervousness , reconstituted as he might , just as he had also reconstituted the promptness with which Chad had corrected his uncertainty . An extraordinarily short time had been required for the correction , and there had ceased to be anything negative in his companion 's face and air as soon as it was made . "
54232	54288	54225	54225	they	1051	" - it had consisted , the determinant touch , in nothing more than that . Well , that was enough , Strether had felt while his answer hung fire . He had felt at the same time , however , that nothing could less become him than that it should hang fire too long . "
54291	54296	54225	54225	they	1051	" he said brightly , "
54324	54328	54329	54329	I	0	" he added , "
54338	54339	54333	54333	you	1049	" "
54375	54379	54372	54372	I	0	" said Chad , "
54406	54410	54398	54398	you	1049	" he continued , "
54443	54447	54449	54449	you	1049	" he laughed , "
54460	54914	54458	54458	you	1049	" he laughed again . He was altogether easy about it , and this made Strether now see how at bottom , and in spite of the shade of shyness that really cost him nothing , he had from the first moment been easy about everything . The shade of shyness was mere good taste . People with manners formed could apparently have , as one of their best cards , the shade of shyness too . He had leaned a little forward to speak ; his elbows were on the table ; and the inscrutable new face that he had got somewhere and somehow was brought by the movement nearer to his critics There was a fascination for that critic in its not being , this ripe physiognomy , the face that , under observation at least , he had originally carried away from Woollett . Strether found a certain freedom on his own side in defining it as that of a man of the world - a formula that indeed seemed to come now in some degree to his relief ; that of a man to whom things had happened and were variously known . In gleams , in glances , the past did perhaps peep out of it ; but such lights were faint and instantly merged . Chad was brown and thick and strong , and of old Chad had been rough . Was all the difference therefore that he was actually smooth ? Possibly ; for that he WAS smooth was as marked as in the taste of a sauce or in the rub of a hand . The effect of it was general - it had retouched his features , drawn them with a cleaner line . It had cleared his eyes and settled his colour and polished his fine square teeth - the main ornament of his face ; and at the same time that it had given him a form and a surface , almost a design , it had toned his voice , established his accent , encouraged his smile to more play and his other motions to less . He had formerly , with a great deal of action , expressed very little ; and he now expressed whatever was necessary with almost none at all . It was as if in short he had really , copious perhaps but shapeless , been put into a firm mould and turned successfully out . The phenomenon - Strether kept eyeing it as a phenomenon , an eminent case - was marked enough to be touched by the finger . He finally put his hand across the table and laid it on Chad 's arm . "
55003	55376	54994	54994	my	0	" Chad again fell back at this and , his hands pocketed , settled himself a little ; in which posture he looked , though he rather anxiously smiled , only the more earnest . Then Strether seemed to see that he was really nervous , and he took that as what he would have called a wholesome sign . The only mark of it hitherto had been his more than once taking off and putting on his wide - brimmed crush hat . He had at this moment made the motion again to remove it , then had only pushed it back , so that it hung informally on his strong young grizzled crop . It was a touch that gave the note of the familiar - the intimate and the belated - to their quiet colloquy ; and it was indeed by some such trivial aid that Strether became aware at the same moment of something else . The observation was at any rate determined in him by some light too fine to distinguish from so many others , but it was none the less sharply determined . Chad looked unmistakeably during these instants - well , as Strether put it to himself , all he was worth . Our friend had a sudden apprehension of what that would on certain sides be . He saw him in a flash as the young man marked out by women ; and for a concentrated minute the dignity , the comparative austerity , as he funnily fancied it , of this character affected him almost with awe . There was an experience on his interlocutor 's part that looked out at him from under the displaced hat , and that looked out moreover by a force of its own , the deep fact of its quantity and quality , and not through Chad 's intending bravado or swagger . That was then the way men marked out by women WERE - and also the men by whom the women were doubtless in turn sufficiently distinguished . It affected Strether for thirty seconds as a relevant truth , a truth which , however , the next minute , had fallen into its relation . "
55386	55390	55392	55393	a fellow	1059	" Chad asked , "
55414	55415	55392	55393	a fellow	1059	" "
55470	55475	55501	55501	you	1058	" Strether wound up , "
55482	55483	55467	55467	I	0	" "
55486	55498	55467	55467	I	0	" Chad had spoken in such surprise that he was amused . "
55513	55521	55508	55508	you	1058	" The young man seemed to consider . "
55533	55534	55523	55523	I	0	" "
55546	55550	55536	55536	you	1058	" Strether laughed . "
55562	55609	55560	55560	myself	0	" And as if to mark what he felt he could by this time count on he was already on his feet . Chad , still seated , stayed him , with a hand against him , as he passed between their table and the next . "
55616	55907	55560	55560	myself	0	" The tone was , as who should say , everything Strether could have desired ; and quite as good the expression of face with which the speaker had looked up at him and kindly held him . All these things lacked was their not showing quite so much as the fruit of experience . Yes , experience was what Chad did play on him , if he did n't play any grossness of defiance . Of course experience was in a manner defiance ; but it was n't , at any rate - rather indeed quite the contrary ! - grossness ; which was so much gained . He fairly grew older , Strether thought , while he himself so reasoned . Then with his mature pat of his visitor 's arm he also got up ; and there had been enough of it all by this time to make the visitor feel that something WAS settled . Was n't it settled that he had at least the testimony of Chad 's own belief in a settlement ? Strether found himself treating Chad 's profession that they would get on as a sufficient basis for going to bed . He had n't nevertheless after this gone to bed directly ; for when they had again passed out together into the mild bright night a check had virtually sprung from nothing more than a small circumstance which might have acted only as confirming quiescence . There were people , expressive sound , projected light , still abroad , and after they had taken in for a moment , through everything , the great clear architectural street , they turned off in tacit union to the quarter of Strether 's hotel . "
55911	55917	55560	55560	myself	0	" Chad here abruptly began , "
55955	55986	55949	55949	you	1062	" He had stopped , leaving his friend to wonder a little what point he wished to make ; and this it was that enabled Strether meanwhile to make one . "
56021	56065	56067	56067	I	0	" But Chad rather oddly insisted , though under the high lamp at their corner , where they paused , he had at first looked as if touched by Strether 's allusion to the long sense , at home , of his absence . "
56075	56076	56070	56070	you	1062	" "
56080	56081	56070	56070	you	1062	" "
56086	56118	56070	56070	you	1062	" It affected Strether : horrors were so little - superficially at least - in this robust and reasoning image . But he was none the less there to be veracious . "
56141	56503	56526	56526	you	1064	" Chad raised his face to the lamp , and it was one of the moments at which he had , in his extraordinary way , most his air of designedly showing himself . It was as if at these instants he just presented himself , his identity so rounded off , his palpable presence and his massive young manhood , as such a link in the chain as might practically amount to a kind of demonstration . It was as if - and how but anomalously ? - he could n't after all help thinking sufficiently well of these things to let them go for what they were worth . What could there be in this for Strether but the hint of some self - respect , some sense of power , oddly perverted ; something latent and beyond access , ominous and perhaps enviable ? The intimation had the next thing , in a flash , taken on a name - a name on which our friend seized as he asked himself if he were n't perhaps really dealing with an irreducible young Pagan . This description - he quite jumped at it - had a sound that gratified his mental ear , so that of a sudden he had already adopted it . Pagan - yes , that was , was n't it ? what Chad WOULD logically be . It was what he must be . It was what he was . The idea was a clue and , instead of darkening the prospect , projected a certain clearness . Strether made out in this quick ray that a Pagan was perhaps , at the pass they had come to , the thing most wanted at Woollett . They 'd be able to do with one - a good one ; he 'd find an opening - yes ; and Strether 's imagination even now prefigured and accompanied the first appearance there of the rousing personage . He had only the slight discomfort of feeling , as the young man turned away from the lamp , that his thought had in the momentary silence possibly been guessed . "
56511	56515	56506	56506	I	0	" said Chad , "
56559	56571	56552	56552	I	0	" With which they walked on again to Strether 's hotel . "
56576	56586	56573	56573	you	1064	" the latter asked as they approached the door , "
56597	56598	56573	56573	you	1064	" "
56609	56610	56573	56573	you	1064	" "
56618	56619	56573	56573	you	1064	" "
56625	56631	56573	56573	you	1064	" Chad was clearly surprised . "
56652	56653	56645	56646	any one	2912	" "
56657	56665	56645	56646	any one	2912	" - Strether took him straight up - "
56721	56728	56715	56715	You	1064	" - he kept it up ; "
56754	56760	56761	56761	I	0	" Chad turned this over . "
56768	56776	56761	56761	I	0	" He spoke quite without resenting it . "
56835	56842	56843	56843	I	0	" He seemed kindly to explain . "
56874	56905	56864	56864	I	0	" There was something in it that held Strether to wonder , and this gave him time to go on . He broke out as with a more helpful thought . "
56916	56927	56911	56911	I	0	" The upshot was indeed to make our friend marvel . "
56941	56961	56911	56911	I	0	" It was HE who almost showed resentment . Chad 's smile of a truth more than met it . "
56968	56977	56908	56908	you	0	" Strether hesitated , but it came out . "
56984	57021	56911	56911	I	0	" Spoken , however , it sounded a trifle odd - the effect of which was that Chad broke into a laugh . Strether , at this , succumbed as well , though with extreme brevity . "
57050	57056	57057	57057	I	0	" he added with decision . "
57065	57076	57057	57057	I	0	" This appeared to open for Chad a new interest . "
57083	57084	57080	57080	you	0	" "
57088	57089	57080	57080	you	0	" "
57095	57103	57104	57104	I	0	" Strether had become a little impatient . "
57113	57114	57057	57057	I	0	" "
57127	57132	57122	57122	you	0	" Again Strether paused . "
57139	57140	57141	57141	Mother	141	" "
57144	57148	57141	57141	Mother	141	" said Chad , "
57153	57168	57141	57141	Mother	141	" Strether , before the closed porte - cochere , fixed him a moment . "
57187	57191	57218	57218	me	0	" he added , "
57199	57211	57212	57212	I	0	" Chad 's pride seemed none the less a little touched . "
57228	57234	57221	57221	I	0	" With which he pursued : "
57242	57243	57236	57236	I	0	" "
57256	57260	57236	57236	I	0	" Strether asked , "
57269	57282	57284	57284	you	0	" It made Chad , after a stare , throw himself back . "
57293	57321	57284	57284	you	0	" His surprise and his verbal emphasis rang out so clear in the still street that Strether winced till he remembered the safety of their English speech . "
57325	57331	57333	57333	they	1085	" the young man demanded , "
57338	57393	57333	57333	they	1085	" At the good faith in the question Strether had changed colour , feeling that , as he would have said , he had put his foot in it . He had appeared stupidly to misrepresent what they thought at Woollett ; but before he had time to rectify Chad again was upon him . "
57404	58044	57398	57398	you	0	" It so fell in , unhappily for Strether , with that reflexion of his own prompted in him by the pleasant air of the Boulevard Malesherbes , that its disconcerting force was rather unfairly great . It was a dig that , administered by himself - and administered even to poor Mrs. Newsome - was no more than salutary ; but administered by Chad - and quite logically - it came nearer drawing blood . They HADn't a low mind - nor any approach to one ; yet incontestably they had worked , and with a certain smugness , on a basis that might be turned against them . Chad had at any rate pulled his visitor up ; he had even pulled up his admirable mother ; he had absolutely , by a turn of the wrist and a jerk of the far - flung noose , pulled up , in a bunch , Woollett browsing in its pride . There was no doubt Woollett HAD insisted on his coarseness ; and what he at present stood there for in the sleeping street was , by his manner of striking the other note , to make of such insistence a preoccupation compromising to the insisters . It was exactly as if they had imputed to him a vulgarity that he had by a mere gesture caused to fall from him . The devil of the case was that Strether felt it , by the same stroke , as falling straight upon himself . He had been wondering a minute ago if the boy were n't a Pagan , and he found himself wondering now if he were n't by chance a gentleman . It did n't in the least , on the spot , spring up helpfully for him that a person could n't at the same time be both . There was nothing at this moment in the air to challenge the combination ; there was everything to give it on the contrary something of a flourish . It struck Strether into the bargain as doing something to meet the most difficult of the questions ; though perhaps indeed only by substituting another . Would n't it be precisely by having learned to be a gentleman that he had mastered the consequent trick of looking so well that one could scarce speak to him straight ? But what in the world was the clue to such a prime producing cause ? There were too many clues then that Strether still lacked , and these clues to clues were among them . What it accordingly amounted to for him was that he had to take full in the face a fresh attribution of ignorance . He had grown used by this time to reminders , especially from his own lips , of what he did n't know ; but he had borne them because in the first place they were private and because in the second they practically conveyed a tribute . He did n't know what was bad , and - as others did n't know how little he knew it - he could put up with his state . But if he did n't know , in so important a particular , what was good , Chad at least was now aware he did n't ; and that , for some reason , affected our friend as curiously public . It was in fact an exposed condition that the young man left him in long enough for him to feel its chill - till he saw fit , in a word , generously again to cover him . This last was in truth what Chad quite gracefully did . But he did it as with a simple thought that met the whole of the case . "
58051	58341	57398	57398	you	0	" It was what Strether had rather bewilderedly to go to bed on . II It really looked true moreover from the way Chad was to behave after this . He was full of attentions to his mother 's ambassador ; in spite of which , all the while , the latter 's other relations rather remarkably contrived to assert themselves . Strether 's sittings pen in hand with Mrs. Newsome up in his own room were broken , yet they were richer ; and they were more than ever interspersed with the hours in which he reported himself , in a different fashion , but with scarce less earnestness and fulness , to Maria Gostrey . Now that , as he would have expressed it , he had really something to talk about he found himself , in respect to any oddity that might reside for him in the double connexion , at once more aware and more indifferent . He had been fine to Mrs. Newsome about his useful friend , but it had begun to haunt his imagination that Chad , taking up again for her benefit a pen too long disused , might possibly be finer . It would n't at all do , he saw , that anything should come up for him at Chad 's hand but what specifically was to have come ; the greatest divergence from which would be precisely the element of any lubrication of their intercourse by levity It was accordingly to forestall such an accident that he frankly put before the young man the several facts , just as they had occurred , of his funny alliance . He spoke of these facts , pleasantly and obligingly , as "
58346	58631	57398	57398	you	0	" and felt that he might qualify the alliance as funny if he remained sufficiently grave about it . He flattered himself that he even exaggerated the wild freedom of his original encounter with the wonderful lady ; he was scrupulously definite about the absurd conditions in which they had made acquaintance - their having picked each other up almost in the street ; and he had finest inspiration of all ! a conception of carrying the war into the enemy 's country by showing surprise at the enemy 's ignorance . He had always had a notion that this last was the grand style of fighting ; the greater therefore the reason for it , as he could n't remember that he had ever before fought in the grand style . Every one , according to this , knew Miss Gostrey : how came it Chad did n't know her ? The difficulty , the impossibility , was really to escape it ; Strether put on him , by what he took for granted , the burden of proof of the contrary . This tone was so far successful as that Chad quite appeared to recognise her as a person whose fame had reached him , but against his acquaintance with whom much mischance had worked . He made the point at the same time that his social relations , such as they could be called , were perhaps not to the extent Strether supposed with the rising flood of their compatriots . He hinted at his having more and more given way to a different principle of selection ; the moral of which seemed to be that he went about little in the "
58634	59394	57398	57398	you	0	" For the moment certainly he had quite another interest . It was deep , what he understood , and Strether , for himself , could only so observe it . He could n't see as yet how deep . Might he not all too soon ! For there was really too much of their question that Chad had already committed himself to liking . He liked , to begin with , his prospective stepfather ; which was distinctly what had not been on the cards . His hating him was the untowardness for which Strether had been best prepared ; he had n't expected the boy 's actual form to give him more to do than his imputed . It gave him more through suggesting that he must somehow make up to himself for not being sure he was sufficiently disagreeable . That had really been present to him as his only way to be sure he was sufficiently thorough . The point was that if Chad 's tolerance of his thoroughness were insincere , were but the best of devices for gaining time , it none the less did treat everything as tacitly concluded . That seemed at the end of ten days the upshot of the abundant , the recurrent talk through which Strether poured into him all it concerned him to know , put him in full possession of facts and figures . Never cutting these colloquies short by a minute , Chad behaved , looked and spoke as if he were rather heavily , perhaps even a trifle gloomily , but none the less fundamentally and comfortably free . He made no crude profession of eagerness to yield , but he asked the most intelligent questions , probed , at moments , abruptly , even deeper than his friend 's layer of information , justified by these touches the native estimate of his latent stuff , and had in every way the air of trying to live , reflectively , into the square bright picture . He walked up and down in front of this production , sociably took Strether 's arm at the points at which he stopped , surveyed it repeatedly from the right and from the left , inclined a critical head to either quarter , and , while he puffed a still more critical cigarette , animadverted to his companion on this passage and that . Strether sought relief - there were hours when he required it - in repeating himself ; it was in truth not to be blinked that Chad had a way . The main question as yet was of what it was a way TO . It made vulgar questions no more easy ; but that was unimportant when all questions save those of his own asking had dropped . That he was free was answer enough , and it was n't quite ridiculous that this freedom should end by presenting itself as what was difficult to move . His changed state , his lovely home , his beautiful things , his easy talk , his very appetite for Strether , insatiable and , when all was said , flattering - what were such marked matters all but the notes of his freedom ? He had the effect of making a sacrifice of it just in these handsome forms to his visitor ; which was mainly the reason the visitor was privately , for the time , a little out of countenance . Strether was at this period again and again thrown back on a felt need to remodel somehow his plan . He fairly caught himself shooting rueful glances , shy looks of pursuit , toward the embodied influence , the definite adversary , who had by a stroke of her own failed him and on a fond theory of whose palpable presence he had , under Mrs. Newsome 's inspiration , altogether proceeded . He had once or twice , in secret , literally expressed the irritated wish that SHE would come out and find her . He could n't quite yet force it upon Woollett that such a career , such a perverted young life , showed after all a certain plausible side , DID in the case before them flaunt something like an impunity for the social man ; but he could at least treat himself to the statement that would prepare him for the sharpest echo . This echo - as distinct over there in the dry thin air as some shrill "
59396	59412	59413	59413	He	1086	" above a column of print - seemed to reach him even as he wrote . "
59420	59479	59413	59413	He	1086	" he could hear Mrs. Newsome report , in capitals almost of newspaper size , to Mrs. Pocock ; and he could focus in Mrs. Pocock the response of the reader of the journal . He could see in the younger lady 's face the earnestness of her attention and catch the full scepticism of her but slightly delayed "
59485	59500	57398	57398	you	0	" Just so he could again as little miss the mother 's clear decision : "
59516	59843	57398	57398	you	0	" Strether had , after posting his letter , the whole scene out ; and it was a scene during which , coming and going , as befell , he kept his eye not least upon the daughter . He had his fine sense of the conviction Mrs. Pocock would take occasion to reaffirm - a conviction bearing , as he had from the first deeply divined it to bear , on Mr. Strether 's essential inaptitude . She had looked him in his conscious eyes even before he sailed , and that she did n't believe HE would find the woman had been written in her book . Had n't she at the best but a scant faith in his ability to find women ? It was n't even as if he had found her mother - so much more , to her discrimination , had her mother performed the finding . Her mother had , in a case her private judgement of which remained educative of Mrs. Pocock 's critical sense , found the man . The man owed his unchallenged state , in general , to the fact that Mrs. Newsome 's discoveries were accepted at Woollett ; but he knew in his bones , our friend did , how almost irresistibly Mrs. Pocock would now be moved to show what she thought of his own . Give HER a free hand , would be the moral , and the woman would soon be found . His impression of Miss Gostrey after her introduction to Chad was meanwhile an impression of a person almost unnaturally on her guard . He struck himself as at first unable to extract from her what he wished ; though indeed OF what he wished at this special juncture he would doubtless have contrived to make but a crude statement . It sifted and settled nothing to put to her , tout betement , as she often said , "
59851	59943	59845	59845	you	1088	" - thanks to his feeling it actually the least of his needs to heap up the evidence in the young man 's favour . He repeatedly knocked at her door to let her have it afresh that Chad 's case - whatever else of minor interest it might yield - was first and foremost a miracle almost monstrous . It was the alteration of the entire man , and was so signal an instance that nothing else , for the intelligent observer , could - COULD it ? - signify . "
59949	59953	57398	57398	you	0	" he declared - "
59964	59973	57398	57398	you	0	" He gave the rein to his fancy . "
59979	59987	57398	57398	you	0	" His fancy seemed to please her . "
59991	59992	57398	57398	you	0	" "
60077	60085	60086	60086	one	2797	" he confessed with a queer face - "
60098	60105	60074	60074	you	1093	" - he puzzled it out - "
60150	60161	60142	60142	one	2797	" Her silences were never barren , nor even dull . "
60170	60176	60165	60165	you	1093	" He tossed it off . "
60182	60198	60165	60165	you	1093	" She had another pause while , across her carpets , he had another walk . "
60212	60213	60205	60205	you	1093	" "
60224	60225	60216	60216	I	0	" "
60230	60251	60228	60228	he	1097	" Miss Gostrey asked . The special tone of it made him , pulling up , look at her long . "
60310	60311	60308	60308	he	1097	" "
60318	60324	60314	60314	he	1097	" she said at last . "
60330	60338	60314	60314	he	1097	" The air of it held him . "
60348	60349	60340	60340	you	1093	" "
60364	60371	60361	60361	I	0	" she declared with some impatience , "
60389	60390	60386	60386	him	1097	" "
60397	60403	60386	60386	him	1097	" he rather blankly urged . "
60410	60411	60386	60386	him	1097	" "
60416	60458	60386	60386	him	1097	" She got up from her chair , at this , with a nearer approach than she had ever yet shown to dismay at his dimness . She even , fairly pausing for it , spoke with a shade of pity . "
60461	60494	60495	60495	You	1093	" It was a shade , fairly , that brought a flush into his face ; so that for a moment , as they waited together , their difference was between them . "
60593	60598	60588	60588	I	0	" he reasonably explained , "
60631	60632	60623	60623	her	1097	" "
60640	60653	60623	60623	her	1097	" said Miss Gostrey . But she as quickly made her point . "
60680	60686	60675	60676	Mere wretches	1102	" she declared with spirit . "
60727	60733	60718	60720	such a somebody	1107	" He took it in . "
60742	60743	60744	60745	A woman	3063	" "
60763	60764	60777	60779	A good woman	1111	" "
60775	60776	60777	60779	A good woman	1111	" "
60781	60791	60777	60779	A good woman	1111	" She threw up her arms with a laugh . "
60798	60799	60795	60795	her	1111	" "
60807	60814	60803	60803	he	1112	" Miss Gostrey thought a moment . "
60828	60833	60835	60835	she	1111	" she went on , "
60840	60860	60835	60835	she	1111	" Strether clearly , more and more , did see ; yet it made him also see other things . "
60874	60875	60878	60878	he	1112	" "
60908	60917	60887	60887	his	1112	" Strether could imagine ; but still - ! "
60925	60931	60887	60887	his	1112	" Again she laughed out . "
60950	60956	60887	60887	his	1112	" she more seriously explained - "
60981	60982	60887	60887	his	1112	" "
60990	60994	60985	60985	you	1116	" Strether said , "
61002	61003	60985	60985	you	1116	" "
61007	61011	61004	61004	I	0	" she replied , "
61022	61026	61018	61018	you	1112	" she asked , "
61069	61082	61067	61067	Chad	111	" He had the courage at least of his companion 's logic . "
61090	61122	61067	61067	Chad	111	" He almost looked , with his quick imagination as if he already did , though seeing at once also the full extent of how little it would suit his book . "
61132	61149	61127	61127	I	0	" She had to confess indeed that it was n't . But there was something else . "
61171	61190	61164	61164	You	1112	" This on his side Strether recognised ; but his acuteness none the less showed him the danger . "
61204	61211	61201	61201	he	1118	" Well , she found something . "
61236	61242	61217	61217	his	1118	" She made it out . "
61251	61258	61217	61217	his	1118	" Strether winced at the image . "
61265	61266	61217	61217	his	1118	" "
61319	61336	61310	61310	He	1118	" Our friend had by this time so got into the vision that he almost gasped . "
61345	61362	61310	61310	He	1118	" Miss Gostrey gave him a look which broke the next moment into a wonderful smile . "
61372	61736	61310	61310	He	1118	" They remained with him , these words , promising him , in their character of warning , considerable help ; but the support he tried to draw from them found itself on each renewal of contact with Chad defeated by something else . What could it be , this disconcerting force , he asked himself , but the sense , constantly renewed , that Chad WAS - quite in fact insisted on being - as good as he thought ? It seemed somehow as if he could n't BUT be as good from the moment he was n't as bad . There was a succession of days at all events when contact with him - and in its immediate effect , as if it could produce no other - elbowed out of Strether 's consciousness everything but itself . Little Bilham once more pervaded the scene , but little Bilham became even in a higher degree than he had originally been one of the numerous forms of the inclusive relation ; a consequence promoted , to our friend 's sense , by two or three incidents with which we have yet to make acquaintance . Waymarsh himself , for the occasion , was drawn into the eddy ; it absolutely , though but temporarily , swallowed him down , and there were days when Strether seemed to bump against him as a sinking swimmer might brush a submarine object . The fathomless medium held them - Chad 's manner was the fathomless medium ; and our friend felt as if they passed each other , in their deep immersion , with the round impersonal eye of silent fish . It was practically produced between them that Waymarsh was giving him then his chance ; and the shade of discomfort that Strether drew from the allowance resembled not a little the embarrassment he had known at school , as a boy , when members of his family had been present at exhibitions . He could perform before strangers , but relatives were fatal , and it was now as if , comparatively , Waymarsh were a relative . He seemed to hear him say "
61741	61806	61807	61807	I	0	" and to enjoy a foretaste of conscientious domestic criticism . He HAD struck up , so far as he actually could ; Chad knew by this time in profusion what he wanted ; and what vulgar violence did his fellow pilgrim expect of him when he had really emptied his mind ? It went somehow to and fro that what poor Waymarsh meant was "
61820	62899	61807	61807	I	0	" but it was also fairly explicit that Strether had his own challenge and that , since they must go to the bottom of things , he wasted no more virtue in watching Chad than Chad wasted in watching him . His dip for duty 's sake - where was it worse than Waymarsh 's own ? For HE need n't have stopped resisting and refusing , need n't have parleyed , at that rate , with the foe . The strolls over Paris to see something or call somewhere were accordingly inevitable and natural , and the late sessions in the wondrous troisieme , the lovely home , when men dropped in and the picture composed more suggestively through the haze of tobacco , of music more or less good and of talk more or less polyglot , were on a principle not to be distinguished from that of the mornings and the afternoons . Nothing , Strether had to recognise as he leaned back and smoked , could well less resemble a scene of violence than even the liveliest of these occasions . They were occasions of discussion , none the less , and Strether had never in his life heard so many opinions on so many subjects . There were opinions at Woollett , but only on three or four . The differences were there to match ; if they were doubtless deep , though few , they were quiet - they were , as might be said , almost as shy as if people had been ashamed of them . People showed little diffidence about such things , on the other hand , in the Boulevard Malesherbes , and were so far from being ashamed of them - or indeed of anything else - that they often seemed to have invented them to avert those agreements that destroy the taste of talk . No one had ever done that at Woollett , though Strether could remember times when he himself had been tempted to it without quite knowing why . He saw why at present - he had but wanted to promote intercourse . These , however , were but parenthetic memories , and the turn taken by his affair on the whole was positively that if his nerves were on the stretch it was because he missed violence . When he asked himself if none would then , in connexion with it , ever come at all , he might almost have passed as wondering how to provoke it . It would be too absurd if such a vision as THAT should have to be invoked for relief ; it was already marked enough as absurd that he should actually have begun with flutters and dignities on the score of a single accepted meal . What sort of a brute had he expected Chad to be , anyway ? - Strether had occasion to make the enquiry but was careful to make it in private . He could himself , comparatively recent as it was - it was truly but the fact of a few days since - focus his primal crudity ; but he would on the approach of an observer , as if handling an illicit possession , have slipped the reminiscence out of sight . There were echoes of it still in Mrs. Newsome 's letters , and there were moments when these echoes made him exclaim on her want of tact . He blushed of course , at once , still more for the explanation than for the ground of it : it came to him in time to save his manners that she could n't at the best become tactful as quickly as he . Her tact had to reckon with the Atlantic Ocean , the General Post - Office and the extravagant curve of the globe . Chad had one day offered tea at the Boulevard Malesherbes to a chosen few , a group again including the unobscured Miss Barrace ; and Strether had on coming out walked away with the acquaintance whom in his letters to Mrs. Newsome he always spoke of as the little artist - man . He had had full occasion to mention him as the other party , so oddly , to the only close personal alliance observation had as yet detected in Chad 's existence . Little Bilham 's way this afternoon was not Strether 's , but he had none the less kindly come with him , and it was somehow a part of his kindness that as it had sadly begun to rain they suddenly found themselves seated for conversation at a cafe in which they had taken refuge . He had passed no more crowded hour in Chad 's society than the one just ended ; he had talked with Miss Barrace , who had reproached him with not having come to see her , and he had above all hit on a happy thought for causing Waymarsh 's tension to relax . Something might possibly be extracted for the latter from the idea of his success with that lady , whose quick apprehension of what might amuse her had given Strether a free hand . What had she meant if not to ask whether she could n't help him with his splendid encumbrance , and might n't the sacred rage at any rate be kept a little in abeyance by thus creating for his comrade 's mind even in a world of irrelevance the possibility of a relation ? What was it but a relation to be regarded as so decorative and , in especial , on the strength of it , to be whirled away , amid flounces and feathers , in a coupe lined , by what Strether could make out , with dark blue brocade ? He himself had never been whirled away - never at least in a coupe and behind a footman ; he had driven with Miss Gostrey in cabs , with Mrs. Pocock , a few times , in an open buggy , with Mrs. Newsome in a four - seated cart and , occasionally up at the mountains , on a buckboard ; but his friend 's actual adventure transcended his personal experience . He now showed his companion soon enough indeed how inadequate , as a general monitor , this last queer quantity could once more feel itself . "
62909	62972	62906	62906	he	1120	" He signified the next moment that his allusion was not to the fat gentleman immersed in dominoes on whom his eyes had begun by resting , but to their host of the previous hour , as to whom , there on the velvet bench , with a final collapse of all consistency , he treated himself to the comfort of indiscretion . "
62981	62997	62977	62977	him	1120	" Little Bilham , in meditation , looked at him with a kindness almost paternal . "
63006	63023	63000	63000	you	1121	" Strether laughed out - for the tone was indeed droll ; he let himself go . "
63065	63081	63103	63103	you	1121	" - and he did his best to show that he simply wished to ascertain - "
63084	63099	63103	63103	you	1121	" His companion looked responsible , but looked it through a small dim smile . "
63106	63122	63103	63103	you	1121	" It was on this that they did have for a little a mute interchange . "
63134	63138	63140	63140	he	1120	" Strether asked wondering "
63145	63146	63140	63140	he	1120	" "
63155	63171	63152	63152	Chad	111	" little Bilham said . Strether here , with a rising hope , just thought , "
63182	63188	63177	63177	them	1123	" But his coherence lapsed . "
63214	63215	63211	63211	she	1110	" "
63223	63228	63191	63192	some woman	1110	" Bilham presently remarked , "
63237	63238	63221	63221	you	1121	" "
63248	63264	63221	63221	you	1121	" The exclamation had escaped our friend , but it made little Bilham more deliberate . "
63271	63276	63265	63265	Chad	111	" he luminously observed . "
63282	63286	63277	63277	He	111	" he added . "
63293	63294	63288	63288	you	1121	" "
63318	63323	63313	63313	I	0	" said little Bilham , "
63338	63339	63325	63325	I	0	" "
63349	63350	63325	63325	I	0	" "
63353	63362	63325	63325	I	0	" the young man after a moment returned , "
63423	63427	63428	63428	I	0	" he pursued , "
63487	63494	63482	63482	He	111	" little Bilham continued to remark , "
63596	63601	63602	63602	I	0	" he wound up , "
63643	63644	63646	63646	I	0	" "
63648	63653	63646	63646	I	0	" - Strether stared . "
63675	63676	63646	63646	I	0	" "
63685	63686	63646	63646	I	0	" "
63692	63696	63689	63689	you	0	" Strether exclaimed . "
63725	63736	63722	63723	the editor	1130	" Little Bilham looked before him a minute in silence . "
63753	63754	63749	63749	he	111	" "
63760	63783	63749	63749	he	111	" Again little Bilham waited , and , with a sense that he had information , Strether scarce knew what was coming . "
63798	63808	63790	63790	He	111	" the young man explained in his lucid way , "
63814	63818	63790	63790	He	111	" Strether hesitated . "
63831	63847	63852	63852	me	0	" His companion matched his pause , but making it up with a quiet fulness . "
63854	63855	63852	63852	me	0	" "
63941	63993	63994	63994	You	0	" As the half - hour meanwhile had ebbed Strether paid his score , and the waiter was presently in the act of counting out change . Our friend pushed back to him a fraction of it , with which , after an emphatic recognition , the personage in question retreated . "
63999	64008	63994	63994	You	0	" little Bilham permitted himself benevolently to observe . "
64016	64021	63994	63994	You	0	" Strether helplessly sighed . "
64027	64044	64023	64023	you	0	" he went on as if to get quickly away from the contemplation of that doom , "
64055	64163	64023	64023	you	0	" Little Bilham had got up as if the transaction with the waiter had been a signal , and had already edged out between the table and the divan . The effect of this was that a minute later they had quitted the place , the gratified waiter alert again at the open door . Strether had found himself deferring to his companion 's abruptness as to a hint that he should be answered as soon as they were more isolated . This happened when after a few steps in the outer air they had turned the next comer . There our friend had kept it up . "
64174	64184	64023	64023	you	0	" Little Bilham looked him full in the face . "
64192	64330	64023	64023	you	0	" This had settled the question so effectually for the time - that is for the next few days - that it had given Strether almost a new lease of life . It must be added however that , thanks to his constant habit of shaking the bottle in which life handed him the wine of experience , he presently found the taste of the lees rising as usual into his draught . His imagination had in other words already dealt with his young friend 's assertion ; of which it had made something that sufficiently came out on the very next occasion of his seeing Maria Gostrey . This occasion moreover had been determined promptly by a new circumstance - a circumstance he was the last man to leave her for a day in ignorance of . "
64339	64344	64332	64332	I	0	" he immediately began , "
64403	64414	64400	64400	his	111	" And then as she this time gave it up : "
64488	64492	64506	64507	the people	1142	" Strether enquired , "
64509	64513	64506	64507	the people	1142	" he explained , "
64617	64618	64619	64619	They	1137	" "
64626	64631	64619	64619	They	1137	" Miss Gostrey asked . "
64637	64641	64642	64642	they	1142	" said Strether , "
64648	64974	64642	64642	they	1142	" He had already told her about that - had seen her the day after his talk with little Bilham ; and they had then threshed out together the bearing of the revelation . She had helped him to put into it the logic in which little Bilham had left it slightly deficient Strether had n't pressed him as to the object of the preference so unexpectedly described ; feeling in the presence of it , with one of his irrepressible scruples , a delicacy from which he had in the quest of the quite other article worked himself sufficiently free . He had held off , as on a small principle of pride , from permitting his young friend to mention a name ; wishing to make with this the great point that Chad 's virtuous attachments were none of his business . He had wanted from the first not to think too much of his dignity , but that was no reason for not allowing it any little benefit that might turn up . He had often enough wondered to what degree his interference might pass for interested ; so that there was no want of luxury in letting it be seen whenever he could that he did n't interfere . That had of course at the same time not deprived him of the further luxury of much private astonishment ; which however he had reduced to some order before communicating his knowledge . When he had done this at last it was with the remark that , surprised as Miss Gostrey might , like himself , at first be , she would probably agree with him on reflexion that such an account of the matter did after all fit the confirmed appearances . Nothing certainly , on all the indications , could have been a greater change for him than a virtuous attachment , and since they had been in search of the "
64976	65109	65110	65110	You	1147	" as the French called it , of that change , little Bilham 's announcement - though so long and so oddly delayed - would serve as well as another . She had assured Strether in fact after a pause that the more she thought of it the more it did serve ; and yet her assurance had n't so weighed with him as that before they parted he had n't ventured to challenge her sincerity . Did n't she believe the attachment was virtuous ? - he had made sure of her again with the aid of that question . The tidings he brought her on this second occasion were moreover such as would help him to make surer still . She showed at first none the less as only amused . "
65132	65145	65124	65124	I	0	" Our friend took the point , but he had his clue . "
65170	65177	65182	65183	the daughter	610	" She gave it more thought . "
65189	65190	65182	65183	the daughter	610	" "
65199	65203	65196	65196	we	1153	" Strether asked , "
65213	65214	65207	65207	She	610	" "
65220	65221	65207	65207	She	610	" "
65281	65328	65329	65329	I	0	" It was always the case for him in these counsels that each of his remarks , as it came , seemed to drop into a deeper well . He had at all events to wait a moment to hear the slight splash of this one . "
65385	65393	65380	65380	he	114	" Strether , responsively , wondered indeed . "
65403	65404	65397	65397	herself	1155	" "
65418	65432	65408	65408	he	114	" Strether 's mind echoed the question , but also again met it . "
65445	65446	65437	65438	the mother	758	" "
65452	65453	65457	65457	she	758	" "
65480	65485	65457	65457	she	758	" Strether threw out , "
65495	65496	65489	65490	the daughter	610	" "
65499	65504	65489	65490	the daughter	610	" said Miss Gostrey , "
65523	65524	65510	65512	every one else	1161	" "
65548	65558	65543	65543	I	0	" he audibly and rather gravely sought to know . "
65561	65566	65529	65529	you	1147	" he went on , "
65595	65604	65591	65591	They	1164	" - he had already worked it out - "
65641	65647	65632	65632	HER	1165	" Miss Gostrey cast about . "
65669	65670	65664	65666	dear old Woollett	87	" "
65674	65678	65664	65666	dear old Woollett	87	" he mused - "
65687	65693	65682	65685	dear old Woollett itself	1166	" She waited a moment . "
65724	65737	65716	65716	she	1154	" Strether , ever restless in such debates , took a vague turn "
65779	65780	65781	65781	Mamie	97	" "
65783	65816	65781	65781	Mamie	97	" He stopped short , at her tone , before her ; then , though seeing that it represented not vagueness , but a momentary embarrassed fulness , let his exclamation come . "
65825	65826	65817	65817	You	1147	" "
65836	65840	65829	65829	I	0	" she smiled . "
65863	65876	65858	65858	Mamie	97	" she roundly declared . Strether resumed for a minute his walk . "
65898	65899	65889	65896	any girl I 've seen over here yet	1169	" "
65910	65922	65889	65896	any girl I 've seen over here yet	1169	" And she mused a moment in her friend 's way . "
65933	65946	65923	65923	I	0	" He humoured the fancy , though indeed finally to deprecate it . "
65975	65982	65983	65983	I	0	" But she kept it up . "
65993	65994	65985	65985	they	1170	" "
66000	66004	66005	66005	they	1170	" he returned , "
66008	66009	66005	66005	they	1170	" "
66033	66046	66026	66026	you	1147	" He had paused before her again , but he continued his course "
66060	66077	66047	66047	They	1170	" Then he came out with the point he had wished after all most to make . "
66107	66115	66100	66100	He	1172	" Miss Gostrey drew in her lips . "
66124	66125	66116	66116	You	1147	" "
66140	66145	66137	66137	you	0	" he went on , "
66153	66154	66147	66147	you	0	" "
66159	66168	66147	66147	you	0	" - she pressed him as he paused . "
66196	66204	66147	66147	you	0	" She took a minute to answer . "
66216	66217	66207	66207	they	1170	" "
66243	66249	66207	66207	they	1170	" Strether had to confess , "
66284	66285	66294	66294	you	0	" "
66288	66292	66294	66294	you	0	" she returned , "
66302	66312	66313	66313	I	0	" Her laugh produced in him a momentary gloom . "
66349	66373	66333	66333	I	0	" A look , over it all , passed between them , and the next minute he had come back to good humour . "
66386	66387	66374	66374	I	0	" "
66402	66403	66404	66404	I	0	" "
66415	66419	66404	66404	I	0	" he smiled , "
66433	66439	66404	66404	I	0	" he almost immediately added . "
66444	66452	66404	66404	I	0	" The transition kept up her spirits . "
66460	66469	66454	66454	you	0	" He did this contention a modified justice . "
66481	66485	66524	66525	the mother	758	" he thought - "
66493	66494	66524	66525	the mother	758	" "
66502	66513	66524	66525	the mother	758	" But she came after this nearer to the question . "
66572	66582	66565	66565	SHE	1155	" Strether , arrested again , considered and demurred . "
66614	66618	66611	66612	the girl	1155	" he continued , "
66669	66676	66677	66677	She	1155	" Miss Gostrey entertained the suggestion . "
66683	66684	66677	66677	She	1155	" "
66692	66738	66739	66739	I	0	" They once more , in spite of this vagueness , exchanged a look - a look that was perhaps the longest yet . It seemed in fact , the next thing , to require to explain itself ; which it did as it could . "
66754	66765	66749	66749	he	111	" Miss Gostrey 's imagination had taken its own flight . "
66773	66788	66749	66749	he	111	" Strether seemed to accept the possibility with reserve . Still he accepted it . "
66805	66815	66749	66749	he	111	" But she looked as if she scarce followed . "
66837	66844	66749	66749	he	111	" He laughed at her question . "
66887	66891	66893	66893	HER	1155	" he asked , "
66895	66896	66897	66897	Ah	1186	" "
66903	66917	66897	66897	Ah	1186	" He said nothing for a moment , and she soon went on . "
66951	66961	66936	66936	He	114	" Strether meanwhile had had time to think more . "
66968	66969	66965	66965	his	114	" "
67015	67020	67010	67010	he	114	" said Miss Gostrey , "
67026	67027	67010	67010	he	114	" "
67032	67033	67010	67010	he	114	" "
67089	67094	67095	67095	you	0	" she gaily declared , "
67100	67159	67095	67095	you	0	" He took it from her with momentary patience and then turned abruptly away . It was always convenient to him that there were so many fine things in her room to look at . But the examination of two or three of them appeared soon to have determined a speech that had little to do with them . "
67167	67168	67160	67160	You	0	" "
67172	67173	67160	67160	You	0	" "
67185	67191	67160	67160	You	0	" But she defended herself . "
67210	67211	67206	67206	We	1191	" "
67214	67221	67206	67206	We	1191	" he echoed with a groan . "
67228	67229	67230	67230	I	0	" "
67234	67238	67230	67230	I	0	" she smiled . "
67249	67250	67241	67241	you	0	" "
67256	67264	67251	67251	You	0	" It made him almost turn pale . "
67270	67296	67251	67251	You	0	" He had dropped on a sofa for dismay ; but she seemed , as she stood over him , to have the last word . "
67309	67886	67300	67300	you	0	" Book Fifth I The Sunday of the next week was a wonderful day , and Chad Newsome had let his friend know in advance that he had provided for it . There had already been a question of his taking him to see the great Gloriani , who was at home on Sunday afternoons and at whose house , for the most part , fewer bores were to be met than elsewhere ; but the project , through some accident , had not had instant effect , and now revived in happier conditions . Chad had made the point that the celebrated sculptor had a queer old garden , for which the weather - spring at last frank and fair - was propitious ; and two or three of his other allusions had confirmed for Strether the expectation of something special . He had by this time , for all introductions and adventures , let himself recklessly go , cherishing the sense that whatever the young man showed him he was showing at least himself . He could have wished indeed , so far as this went , that Chad were less of a mere cicerone ; for he was not without the impression - now that the vision of his game , his plan , his deep diplomacy , did recurrently assert itself - of his taking refuge from the realities of their intercourse in profusely dispensing , as our friend mentally phrased et panem et circenses . Our friend continued to feel rather smothered in flowers , though he made in his other moments the almost angry inference that this was only because of his odious ascetic suspicion of any form of beauty . He periodically assured himself - for his reactions were sharp - that he should n't reach the truth of anything till he had at least got rid of that . He had known beforehand that Madame de Vionnet and her daughter would probably be on view , an intimation to that effect having constituted the only reference again made by Chad to his good friends from the south . The effect of Strether 's talk about them with Miss Gostrey had been quite to consecrate his reluctance to pry ; something in the very air of Chad 's silence - judged in the light of that talk - offered it to him as a reserve he could markedly match . It shrouded them about with he scarce knew what , a consideration , a distinction ; he was in presence at any rate - so far as it placed him there - of ladies ; and the one thing that was definite for him was that they themselves should be , to the extent of his responsibility , in presence of a gentleman . Was it because they were very beautiful , very clever , or even very good - was it for one of these reasons that Chad was , so to speak , nursing his effect ? Did he wish to spring them , in the Woollett phrase , with a fuller force - to confound his critic , slight though as yet the criticism , with some form of merit exquisitely incalculable ? The most the critic had at all events asked was whether the persons in question were French ; and that enquiry had been but a proper comment on the sound of their name . "
67893	69304	69306	69306	I	0	" had been Chad 's reply ; but he had immediately added that their English was the most charming in the world , so that if Strether were wanting an excuse for not getting on with them he would n't in the least find one . Never in fact had Strether - in the mood into which the place had quickly launched him - felt , for himself , less the need of an excuse . Those he might have found would have been , at the worst , all for the others , the people before him , in whose liberty to be as they were he was aware that he positively rejoiced . His fellow guests were multiplying , and these things , their liberty , their intensity , their variety , their conditions at large , were in fusion in the admirable medium of the scene . The place itself was a great impression - a small pavilion , clear - faced and sequestered , an effect of polished parquet , of fine white panel and spare sallow gilt , of decoration delicate and rare , in the heart of the Faubourg Saint - Germain and on the edge of a cluster of gardens attached to old noble houses . Far back from streets and unsuspected by crowds , reached by a long passage and a quiet court , it was as striking to the unprepared mind , he immediately saw , as a treasure dug up ; giving him too , more than anything yet , the note of the range of the immeasurable town and sweeping away , as by a last brave brush , his usual landmarks and terms . It was in the garden , a spacious cherished remnant , out of which a dozen persons had already passed , that Chad 's host presently met them while the tall bird - haunted trees , all of a twitter with the spring and the weather , and the high party - walls , on the other side of which grave hotels stood off for privacy , spoke of survival , transmission , association , a strong indifferent persistent order . The day was so soft that the little party had practically adjourned to the open air but the open air was in such conditions all a chamber of state . Strether had presently the sense of a great convent , a convent of missions , famous for he scarce knew what , a nursery of young priests , of scattered shade , of straight alleys and chapel - bells , that spread its mass in one quarter ; he had the sense of names in the air , of ghosts at the windows , of signs and tokens , a whole range of expression , all about him , too thick for prompt discrimination . This assault of images became for a moment , in the address of the distinguished sculptor , almost formidable : Gloriani showed him , in such perfect confidence , on Chad 's introduction of him , a fine worn handsome face , a face that was like an open letter in a foreign tongue . With his genius in his eyes , his manners on his lips , his long career behind him and his honours and rewards all round , the great artist , in the course of a single sustained look and a few words of delight at receiving him , affected our friend as a dazzling prodigy of type . Strether had seen in museums - in the Luxembourg as well as , more reverently , later on , in the New York of the billionaires - the work of his hand ; knowing too that after an earlier time in his native Rome he had migrated , in mid - career , to Paris , where , with a personal lustre almost violent , he shone in a constellation : all of which was more than enough to crown him , for his guest , with the light , with the romance , of glory . Strether , in contact with that element as he had never yet so intimately been , had the consciousness of opening to it , for the happy instant , all the windows of his mind , of letting this rather grey interior drink in for once the sun of a clime not marked in his old geography . He was to remember again repeatedly the medal - like Italian face , in which every line was an artist 's own , in which time told only as tone and consecration ; and he was to recall in especial , as the penetrating radiance , as the communication of the illustrious spirit itself , the manner in which , while they stood briefly , in welcome and response , face to face , he was held by the sculptor 's eyes . He was n't soon to forget them , was to think of them , all unconscious , unintending , preoccupied though they were , as the source of the deepest intellectual sounding to which he had ever been exposed . He was in fact quite to cherish his vision of it , to play with it in idle hours ; only speaking of it to no one and quite aware he could n't have spoken without appearing to talk nonsense . Was what it had told him or what it had asked him the greater of the mysteries ? Was it the most special flare , unequalled , supreme , of the aesthetic torch , lighting that wondrous world for ever , or was it above all the long straight shaft sunk by a personal acuteness that life had seasoned to steel ? Nothing on earth could have been stranger and no one doubtless more surprised than the artist himself , but it was for all the world to Strether just then as if in the matter of his accepted duty he had positively been on trial . The deep human expertness in Gloriani 's charming smile - oh the terrible life behind it ! - was flashed upon him as a test of his stuff . Chad meanwhile , after having easily named his companion , had still more easily turned away and was already greeting other persons present . He was as easy , clever Chad , with the great artist as with his obscure compatriot , and as easy with every one else as with either : this fell into its place for Strether and made almost a new light , giving him , as a concatenation , something more he could enjoy . He liked Gloriani , but should never see him again ; of that he was sufficiently sure . Chad accordingly , who was wonderful with both of them , was a kind of link for hopeless fancy , an implication of possibilities - oh if everything had been different ! Strether noted at all events that he was thus on terms with illustrious spirits , and also that - yes , distinctly - he had n't in the least swaggered about it . Our friend had n't come there only for this figure of Abel Newsome 's son , but that presence threatened to affect the observant mind as positively central . Gloriani indeed , remembering something and excusing himself , pursued Chad to speak to him , and Strether was left musing on many things . One of them was the question of whether , since he had been tested , he had passed . Did the artist drop him from having made out that he would n't do ? He really felt just to - day that he might do better than usual . Had n't he done well enough , so far as that went , in being exactly so dazzled ? and in not having too , as he almost believed , wholly hidden from his host that he felt the latter 's plummet ? Suddenly , across the garden , he saw little Bilham approach , and it was a part of the fit that was on him that as their eyes met he guessed also HIS knowledge . If he had said to him on the instant what was uppermost he would have said : "
69321	69460	69315	69315	one	2797	" Little Bilham would have reassured him , have told him that he exaggerated , and have adduced happily enough the argument of little Bilham 's own very presence ; which , in truth , he could see , was as easy a one as Gloriani 's own or as Chad 's . He himself would perhaps then after a while cease to be frightened , would get the point of view for some of the faces - types tremendously alien , alien to Woollett - that he had already begun to take in . Who were they all , the dispersed groups and couples , the ladies even more unlike those of Woollett than the gentlemen ? - this was the enquiry that , when his young friend had greeted him , he did find himself making . "
69675	69681	69682	69682	Strether	82	" Ah does n't he ? "
69693	69701	69690	69690	his	83	" How then should I be here ? "
69717	69728	69709	69709	You	82	" Well , the young man took in the scene . "
69737	69746	69709	69709	You	82	" Strether followed the direction of his eyes . "
69758	69765	69748	69748	they	1207	" Little Bilham showed his competence . "
69769	69803	69748	69748	they	1207	" This was a category our friend had a feeling for ; a light , romantic and mysterious , on the feminine element , in which he enjoyed for a little watching it . "
69809	69814	69807	69807	Poles	146	" His companion considered . "
69831	69838	69829	69829	Turks	147	" Strether wondered , desiring justice . "
69849	69850	69839	69839	They	147	" "
69859	69880	69855	69855	they	147	" And then , while Strether was aware of fearing closer quarters , though giving himself again to the harmonies , "
69883	69889	69855	69855	they	147	" little Bilham went on , "
69928	69933	69923	69923	you	0	" he handsomely added , "
69936	69948	69949	69949	I	0	" Strether liked it and felt it only too much ; so "
69959	69965	69949	69949	I	0	" he rather helplessly murmured . "
69968	69973	69949	69949	I	0	" his companion returned , "
69981	69982	69974	69974	he	1213	" "
69989	69990	69986	69986	you	0	" "
70070	70071	70072	70072	I	0	" "
70076	70082	70072	70072	I	0	" Strether said , amused , "
70095	70096	70086	70086	me	0	" "
70107	70112	70114	70114	you	0	" little Bilham asked , "
70122	70123	70114	70114	you	0	" "
70133	70137	70131	70131	you	0	" Strether laughed . "
70169	70170	70153	70153	I	0	" "
70215	70224	70225	70225	You	0	" little Bilham smiled as he glanced round . "
70230	70297	70225	70225	You	0	" It made Strether for a moment give himself again to contemplation . There were faces he scarce knew what to make of . Were they charming or were they only strange ? He might n't talk politics , yet he suspected a Pole or two . The upshot was the question at the back of his head from the moment his friend had joined him . "
70307	70308	70299	70301	Madame de Vionnet	85	" "
70339	70346	70336	70337	a collector	1228	" little Bilham added without offence . "
70370	70375	70367	70368	a collector	1228	" Strether went on . "
70384	70401	70402	70402	I	0	" The young man met , on it , a little , his friend 's eyes . "
70440	70446	70455	70455	their	1231	" little Bilham went on , "
70462	70473	70474	70474	Chad	111	" Strether , very quickly , turned these things over . "
70494	70495	70488	70488	he	111	" "
70502	70509	70498	70498	you	0	" Strether did him the justice . "
70515	70516	70498	70498	you	0	" "
70519	70524	70488	70488	he	111	" said little Bilham , "
70558	70563	70565	70565	you	0	" he benevolently added , "
70570	70583	70565	70565	you	0	" Strether looked at him with an indulgence that matched his intelligence . "
70603	70613	70614	70614	I	0	" Little Bilham considered the depth of his reasoning . "
70642	70649	70650	70650	They	1234	" Strether came round to it . "
70657	70658	70650	70650	They	1234	" "
70695	70705	70691	70691	I	0	" the young man declared with a pleasant emphasis , "
70710	70737	70691	70691	I	0	" Strether looked more widely round , and what he saw , from face to face , deepened the effect of his young friend 's words . "
70743	70744	70691	70691	I	0	" "
70747	70753	70691	70691	I	0	" Strether had a pause . "
70759	70760	70754	70755	The husband	1237	" "
70766	70767	70691	70691	I	0	" "
70770	70782	70691	70691	I	0	" said Strether . After which , as his companion laughed : "
70791	70792	70793	70793	You	0	" "
70803	70804	70799	70799	One	2797	" "
70813	70814	70805	70805	Chad	111	" "
70821	70825	70805	70805	Chad	111	" Strether wondered . "
70832	70833	70805	70805	Chad	111	" "
70848	70849	70818	70818	I	0	" "
70854	70867	70818	70818	I	0	" Strether said rather strangely . But then as if to attenuate : "
70877	70882	70870	70870	they	1241	" Little Bilham smiled . "
70893	70963	70888	70888	you	0	" It had brought them , as she caught the last words , into relation with Miss Barrace , whom Strether had already observed - as he had never before seen a lady at a party - moving about alone . Coming within sound of them she had already spoken , and she took again , through her long - handled glass , all her amused and amusing possession . "
70985	70990	70980	70980	you	82	" she gaily declared , "
71019	71020	71016	71017	Miss Gostrey	99	" "
71024	71029	71016	71017	Miss Gostrey	99	" little Bilham exclaimed , "
71064	71065	71066	71068	Madame de Vionnet	85	" "
71076	71189	71066	71068	Madame de Vionnet	85	" Miss Barrace cried in a wonderful crescendo . There was more in it , our friend made out , than met the ear . Was it after all a joke that he should be serious about anything ? He envied Miss Barrace at any rate her power of not being . She seemed , with little cries and protests and quick recognitions , movements like the darts of some fine high - feathered free - pecking bird , to stand before life as before some full shop - window . You could fairly hear , as she selected and pointed , the tap of her tortoise - shell against the glass . "
71252	71258	71245	71245	You	1248	" she continued to Strether , "
71291	71292	71276	71276	You	1248	" "
71295	71304	71312	71312	We	1244	" - little Bilham put it with discouragement - "
71333	71334	71336	71336	you	1248	" "
71341	71353	71336	71336	you	1248	" she replied as with an impatient rap on the glass , "
71386	71387	71380	71381	the savages	1251	" "
71391	71398	71399	71399	they	1251	" the young man woefully confessed : "
71440	71441	71437	71438	a Christian	1254	" "
71449	71459	71437	71438	a Christian	1254	" - and Miss Barrace appealed again to Strether - "
71507	71508	71499	71499	I	0	" "
71511	71530	71531	71531	He	1256	" - he had already taken her up . She laughed out as at the alarm of it . "
71550	71551	71552	71552	He	1256	" "
71556	71560	71552	71552	He	1256	" Strether conceded . "
71619	71620	71612	71612	you	0	" "
71628	71633	71612	71612	you	0	" Miss Barrace said . "
71664	71668	71660	71660	He	1256	" she repeated . "
71671	71679	71680	71680	He	1256	" - little Bilham completed her meaning . "
71705	71706	71685	71685	Moses	148	" "
71715	71719	71685	71685	Moses	148	" she returned , "
71831	71863	71867	71867	he	1256	" She was delighted at this hit of her identity with that personage - it fitted so her character ; she declared it was the title she meant henceforth to adopt . "
71909	71916	71905	71905	he	1256	" Miss Barrace once more insisted . "
71924	72018	71917	71917	He	1256	" It presented him none the less , in truth , to her actual friends , who looked at each other in intelligence , with frank amusement on Bilham 's part and a shade of sadness on Strether 's . Strether 's sadness sprang - for the image had its grandeur - from his thinking how little he himself was wrapt in his blanket , how little , in marble halls , all too oblivious of the Great Father , he resembled a really majestic aboriginal . But he had also another reflexion . "
72054	72055	72048	72048	you	1265	" "
72059	72077	72048	72048	you	1265	" little Bilham explained , watching serenely , across the garden , the several femmes du monde . "
72086	72105	72107	72107	you	1265	" he kindly continued ; speaking as if for Strether 's benefit not less than for her own . "
72109	72125	72107	72107	you	1265	" Strether , scarce knowing what he was about , asked of her almost eagerly . "
72130	72140	72141	72142	Mr. Bilham	83	" - she was mightily amused at his tone - "
72169	72191	72162	72162	you	1265	" - and she fixed him again , through all her tortoise - shell , with the droll interest of it . "
72220	72271	72272	72272	she	0	" she went on , ' strange people . I do n't know how it happens ; I do n't do it on purpose ; it seems to be my doom - as if I were always one of their habits : it 's wonderful ! I dare say moreover , "
72279	72350	72272	72272	she	0	" that I do , that we all do here , run too much to mere eye . But how can it be helped ? We 're all looking at each other - and in the light of Paris one sees what things resemble . That 's what the light of Paris seems always to show . It 's the fault of the light of Paris - dear old light ! "
72351	72356	72357	72358	little Bilham	83	" Dear old Paris ! "
72361	72368	72357	72358	little Bilham	83	" Everything , every one shows , "
72374	72382	72383	72383	Strether	82	" But for what they really are ? "
72386	72401	72383	72383	Strether	82	" Oh I like your Boston ' reallys ' ! But sometimes - yes . "
72402	72408	72409	72409	Strether	82	" Dear old Paris then ! "
72427	72444	72423	72423	he	82	" Does Madame de Vionnet do that ? I mean really show for what she is ? "
72450	72459	72423	72423	he	82	" She 's charming . She 's perfect . "
72460	72481	72482	72482	She	131	" Then why did you a minute ago say ' Oh , oh , oh ! ' at her name ? "
72486	72496	72482	72482	She	131	" Why just because - ! She 's wonderful . "
72497	72502	72504	72504	Strether	82	" Ah she too ? "
72518	72534	72511	72512	Miss Barrace	131	" Why not put your question straight to the person who can answer it best ? "
72535	72538	72540	72541	little Bilham	83	" No , "
72543	72575	72540	72541	little Bilham	83	" do n't put any question ; wait , rather - it will be much more fun - to judge for yourself . He has come to take you to her . "
73196	73225	73184	73184	he	82	" Here you are then , face to face at last ; you 're made for each other - vous allez voir ; and I bless your union . "
73257	73259	73263	73263	her	1272	" Jeanne "
73287	73293	73294	73296	the young man	2833	" Ah but you know , "
73300	73305	73294	73296	the young man	2833	" he must see her "
73474	73484	73485	73485	she	1272	" I 've heard a great deal about you , "
73504	73526	73485	73485	she	1272	" Well , about YOU , Madame de Vionnet , I 've heard , I 'm bound to say , almost nothing "
73771	73777	73778	73778	she	1272	" Has n't Miss Gostrey , "
73789	73832	73778	73778	she	1272	" What had struck him first was the way he was bracketed with that lady ; and he wondered what account Chad would have given of their acquaintance . Something not as yet traceable , at all events , had obviously happened . "
73843	73844	73839	73839	her	1272	" "
73865	73874	73854	73854	I	0	" This was one of the things - the "
73876	74391	74392	74392	Duchesse	153	" Miss Gostrey would now tell him - that , with every deference to present preoccupation , was uppermost for Strether after they had taken their seat . One of the others was , at the end of five minutes , that she - oh incontestably , yes - DIFFERED less ; differed , that is , scarcely at all - well , superficially speaking , from Mrs. Newsome or even from Mrs. Pocock . She was ever so much younger than the one and not so young as the other ; but what WAS there in her , if anything , that would have made it impossible he should meet her at Woollett ? And wherein was her talk during their moments on the bench together not the same as would have been found adequate for a Woollett garden - party ? - unless perhaps truly in not being quite so bright . She observed to him that Mr. Newsome had , to her knowledge , taken extraordinary pleasure in his visit ; but there was no good lady at Woollett who would n't have been at least up to that . Was there in Chad , by chance , after all , deep down , a principle of aboriginal loyalty that had made him , for sentimental ends , attach himself to elements , happily encountered , that would remind him most of the old air and the old soil ? Why accordingly be in a flutter - Strether could even put it that way - about this unfamiliar phenomenon of the femme du monde ? On these terms Mrs. Newsome herself was as much of one . Little Bilham verily had testified that they came out , the ladies of the type , in close quarters ; but it was just in these quarters - now comparatively close - that he felt Madame de Vionnet 's common humanity . She did come out , and certainly to his relief , but she came out as the usual thing . There might be motives behind , but so could there often be even at Woollett . The only thing was that if she showed him she wished to like him - as the motives behind might conceivably prompt - it would possibly have been more thrilling for him that she should have shown as more vividly alien . Ah she was neither Turk nor Pole ! - which would be indeed flat once more for Mrs. Newsome and Mrs. Pocock . A lady and two gentlemen had meanwhile , however , approached their bench , and this accident stayed for the time further developments . They presently addressed his companion , the brilliant strangers ; she rose to speak to them , and Strether noted how the escorted lady , though mature and by no means beautiful , had more of the bold high look , the range of expensive reference , that he had , as might have been said , made his plans for . Madame de Vionnet greeted her as "
74393	74407	74408	74411	Ma toute - belle	1283	" and was greeted in turn , while talk started in French , as "
74412	74512	74526	74526	ME	0	" ; little facts that had their due , their vivid interest for Strether . Madame de Vionnet did n't , none the less , introduce him - a note he was conscious of as false to the Woollett scale and the Woollett humanity ; though it did n't prevent the Duchess , who struck him as confident and free , very much what he had obscurely supposed duchesses , from looking at him as straight and as hard - for it WAS hard - as if she would have liked , all the same , to know him . "
74554	74923	74526	74526	ME	0	" - some such loose handful of bright flowers she seemed , fragrantly enough , to fling at him . Strether almost wondered - at such a pace was he going - if some divination of the influence of either party were what determined Madame de Vionnet 's abstention . One of the gentlemen , in any case , succeeded in placing himself in close relation with our friend 's companion ; a gentleman rather stout and importantly short , in a hat with a wonderful wide curl to its brim and a frock coat buttoned with an effect of superlative decision . His French had quickly turned to equal English , and it occurred to Strether that he might well be one of the ambassadors . His design was evidently to assert a claim to Madame de Vionnet 's undivided countenance , and he made it good in the course of a minute - led her away with a trick of three words ; a trick played with a social art of which Strether , looking after them as the four , whose backs were now all turned , moved off , felt himself no master . He sank again upon his bench and , while his eyes followed the party , reflected , as he had done before , on Chad 's strange communities . He sat there alone for five minutes , with plenty to think of ; above all with his sense of having suddenly been dropped by a charming woman overlaid now by other impressions and in fact quite cleared and indifferent . He had n't yet had so quiet a surrender ; he did n't in the least care if nobody spoke to him more . He might have been , by his attitude , in for something of a march so broad that the want of ceremony with which he had just been used could fall into its place as but a minor incident of the procession . Besides , there would be incidents enough , as he felt when this term of contemplation was closed by the reappearance of little Bilham , who stood before him a moment with a suggestive "
74926	74944	74526	74526	ME	0	" in which he saw himself reflected as disorganised , as possibly floored . He replied with a "
74947	75041	74526	74526	ME	0	" intended to show that he was n't floored in the least . No indeed ; he gave it out , as the young man sat down beside him , that if , at the worst , he had been overturned at all , he had been overturned into the upper air , the sublimer element with which he had an affinity and in which he might be trusted a while to float . It was n't a descent to earth to say after an instant and in sustained response to the reference : "
75051	75052	74526	74526	ME	0	" "
75058	75059	74526	74526	ME	0	" "
75064	75065	74526	74526	ME	0	" "
75070	75078	74526	74526	ME	0	" Strether had after all to think . "
75087	75271	75085	75085	them	1288	" But it did n't for the moment matter more than that . He assured his young friend he was quite content . They would n't stir ; were all right as they were . He did n't want to be introduced ; had been introduced already about as far as he could go . He had seen moreover an immensity ; liked Gloriani , who , as Miss Barrace kept saying , was wonderful ; had made out , he was sure , the half - dozen other ' men who were distinguished , the artists , the critics and oh the great dramatist - HIM it was easy to spot ; but wanted - no , thanks , really - to talk with none of them ; having nothing at all to say and finding it would do beautifully as it was ; do beautifully because what it was - well , was just simply too late . And when after this little Bilham , submissive and responsive , but with an eye to the consolation nearest , easily threw off some "
75277	75288	75085	75085	them	1288	" all he got in return for it was a sharp "
75294	75404	75085	75085	them	1288	" This note indeed the next thing overflowed for Strether into a quiet stream of demonstration that as soon as he had let himself go he felt as the real relief . It had consciously gathered to a head , but the reservoir had filled sooner than he knew , and his companion 's touch was to make the waters spread . There were some things that had to come in time if they were to come at all . If they did n't come in time they were lost for ever . It was the general sense of them that had overwhelmed him with its long slow rush . "
75982	76076	76082	76082	I	0	" ... Slowly and sociably , with full pauses and straight dashes , Strether had so delivered himself ; holding little Bilham from step to step deeply and gravely attentive . The end of all was that the young man had turned quite solemn , and that this was a contradiction of the innocent gaiety the speaker had wished to promote . He watched for a moment the consequence of his words , and then , laying a hand on his listener 's knee and as if to end with the proper joke : "
76088	76089	76082	76082	I	0	" "
76111	76112	76097	76097	I	0	" "
76121	76125	76097	76097	I	0	" said Strether , "
76131	76145	76148	76148	you	1306	" Little Bilham continued to think , but at last had a smile . "
76155	76156	76148	76148	you	1306	" "
76173	76322	76171	76171	myself	0	" Strether had risen with this , giving his attention now to an encounter that , in the middle of the garden , was in the act of taking place between their host and the lady at whose side Madame de Vionnet had quitted him . This lady , who appeared within a few minutes to have left her friends , awaited Gloriani 's eager approach with words on her lips that Strether could n't catch , but of which her interesting witty face seemed to give him the echo . He was sure she was prompt and fine , but also that she had met her match , and he liked - in the light of what he was quite sure was the Duchess 's latent insolence - the good humour with which the great artist asserted equal resources . Were they , this pair , of the "
76325	76426	76427	76427	I	0	" ? - and was he himself , for the moment and thus related to them by his observation , IN it ? Then there was something in the great world covertly tigerish , which came to him across the lawn and in the charming air as a waft from the jungle . Yet it made him admire most of the two , made him envy , the glossy male tiger , magnificently marked . These absurdities of the stirred sense , fruits of suggestion ripening on the instant , were all reflected in his next words to little Bilham . "
76443	76460	76461	76461	Gloriani	84	" Little Bilham followed his eyes ; but then as with a shade of knowing surprise : "
76463	76701	76461	76461	Gloriani	84	" Our friend had in fact already hesitated , though not on the hint of his companion 's doubt , in which there were depths of critical reserve . He had just made out , in the now full picture , something and somebody else ; another impression had been superimposed . A young girl in a white dress and a softly plumed white hat had suddenly come into view , and what was presently clear was that her course was toward them . What was clearer still was that the handsome young man at her side was Chad Newsome , and what was clearest of all was that she was therefore Mademoiselle de Vionnet , that she was unmistakeably pretty - bright gentle shy happy wonderful - and that Chad now , with a consummate calculation of effect , was about to present her to his old friend 's vision . What was clearest of all indeed was something much more than this , something at the single stroke of which - and was n't it simply juxtaposition ? - all vagueness vanished . It was the click of a spring - he saw the truth . He had by this time also met Chad 's look ; there was more of it in that ; and the truth , accordingly , so far as Bilham 's enquiry was concerned , had thrust in the answer . "
76705	76717	76461	76461	Gloriani	84	" - it was that rare youth he should have enjoyed being "
76720	76957	76461	76461	Gloriani	84	" The virtuous attachment would be all there before him ; the virtuous attachment would be in the very act of appeal for his blessing ; Jeanne de Vionnet , this charming creature , would be exquisitely , intensely now - the object of it . Chad brought her straight up to him , and Chad was , oh yes , at this moment - for the glory of Woollett or whatever - better still even than Gloriani . He had plucked this blossom ; he had kept it over - night in water ; and at last as he held it up to wonder he did enjoy his effect . That was why Strether had felt at first the breath of calculation - and why moreover , as he now knew , his look at the girl would be , for the young man , a sign of the latter 's success . What young man had ever paraded about that way , without a reason , a maiden in her flower ? And there was nothing in his reason at present obscure . Her type sufficiently told of it - they would n't , they could n't , want her to go to Woollett . Poor Woollett , and what it might miss ! - though brave Chad indeed too , and what it might gain ! Brave Chad however had just excellently spoken . "
76984	76994	77007	77007	his	1314	" - he had turned to the child herself - "
77035	77173	77174	77174	Mamma	157	" She stood there quite pink , a little frightened , prettier and prettier and not a bit like her mother . There was in this last particular no resemblance but that of youth to youth ; and here was in fact suddenly Strether 's sharpest impression . It went wondering , dazed , embarrassed , back to the woman he had just been talking with ; it was a revelation in the light of which he already saw she would become more interesting . So slim and fresh and fair , she had yet put forth this perfection ; so that for really believing it of her , for seeing her to any such developed degree as a mother , comparison would be urgent . Well , what was it now but fairly thrust upon him ? "
77184	77189	77191	77191	she	157	" the girl said , "
77213	77214	77215	77215	She	157	" "
77220	77225	77218	77218	herself	157	" Chad helpfully explained : "
77241	77242	77233	77233	she	157	" "
77249	77266	77233	77233	she	157	" Strether murmured , looking kindly from one to the other and wondering at many things . "
77276	77292	77268	77268	I	0	" Jeanne continued with her hands clasped together as if in some small learnt prayer - "
77307	77308	77293	77293	I	0	" "
77323	77538	77316	77316	I	0	" Chad genially declared in answer to this , while Strether himself almost held his breath . What was in the girl was indeed too soft , too unknown for direct dealing ; so that one could only gaze at it as at a picture , quite staying one 's own hand . But with Chad he was now on ground - Chad he could meet ; so pleasant a confidence in that and in everything did the young man freely exhale . There was the whole of a story in his tone to his companion , and he spoke indeed as if already of the family . It made Strether guess the more quickly what it might be about which Madame de Vionnet was so urgent . Having seen him then she had found him easy ; she wished to have it out with him that some way for the young people must be discovered , some way that would not impose as a condition the transplantation of her daughter . He already saw himself discussing with this lady the attractions of Woollett as a residence for Chad 's companion . Was that youth going now to trust her with the affair - so that it would be after all with one of his "
77542	77699	77293	77293	I	0	" that his mother 's missionary should be condemned to deal ? It was quite as if for an instant the two men looked at each other on this question . But there was no mistaking at last Chad 's pride in the display of such a connexion . This was what had made him so carry himself while , three minutes before , he was bringing it into view ; what had caused his friend , first catching sight of him , to be so struck with his air . It was , in a word , just when he thus finally felt Chad putting things straight off on him that he envied him , as he had mentioned to little Bilham , most . The whole exhibition however was but a matter of three or four minutes , and the author of it had soon explained that , as Madame de Vionnet was immediately going "
77702	77729	77293	77293	I	0	" this could be for Jeanne but a snatch . They would all meet again soon , and Strether was meanwhile to stay and amuse himself - "
77741	77763	77730	77730	I	0	" He took the girl off as he had brought her , and Strether , with the faint sweet foreignness of her "
77769	78005	77767	77767	monsieur	1320	" in his ears as a note almost unprecedented , watched them recede side by side and felt how , once more , her companion 's relation to her got an accent from it . They disappeared among the others and apparently into the house ; whereupon our friend turned round to give out to little Bilham the conviction of which he was full . But there was no little Bilham any more ; little Bilham had within the few moments , for reasons of his own , proceeded further : a circumstance by which , in its order , Strether was also sensibly affected . III Chad was not in fact on this occasion to keep his promise of coming back ; but Miss Gostrey had soon presented herself with an explanation of his failure . There had been reasons at the last for his going off with ces dames ; and he had asked her with much instance to come out and take charge of their friend . She did so , Strether felt as she took her place beside him , in a manner that left nothing to desire . He had dropped back on his bench , alone again for a time , and the more conscious for little Bilham 's defection of his unexpressed thought ; in respect to which however this next converser was a still more capacious vessel . "
78011	78277	78008	78009	the child	759	" he had exclaimed to her almost as soon as she appeared ; and though her direct response was for some time delayed he could feel in her meanwhile the working of this truth . It might have been simply , as she waited , that they were now in presence altogether of truth spreading like a flood and not for the moment to be offered her in the mere cupful ; inasmuch as who should ces dames prove to be but persons about whom - once thus face to face with them - she found she might from the first have told him almost everything ? This would have freely come had he taken the simple precaution of giving her their name . There could be no better example - and she appeared to note it with high amusement - than the way , making things out already so much for himself , he was at last throwing precautions to the winds . They were neither more nor less , she and the child 's mother , than old school - friends - friends who had scarcely met for years but whom this unlooked - for chance had brought together with a rush . It was a relief , Miss Gostrey hinted , to feel herself no longer groping ; she was unaccustomed to grope and as a general thing , he might well have seen , made straight enough for her clue . With the one she had now picked up in her hands there need be at least no waste of wonder . "
78290	78296	78278	78278	She	1322	" Strether 's counsellor continued ; "
78309	78334	78298	78298	I	0	" The waste of wonder might be proscribed ; but Strether , characteristically , was even by this time in the immensity of space . "
78346	78351	78340	78340	you	1323	" She just hesitated . "
78382	78387	78392	78392	your	1323	" Strether hung poised . "
78398	78409	78392	78392	your	1323	" She gave one of her rare flickers of impatience . "
78431	78438	78424	78424	I	0	" Poor Strether 's face lengthened . "
78444	78445	78439	78439	She	1322	" "
78456	78457	78446	78446	She	1322	" "
78464	78474	78446	78446	She	1322	" She had to think how to put it . "
78488	78496	78497	78497	I	0	" He looked at her an instant . "
78509	78528	78446	78446	She	1322	" Their eyes had on it in fact an exchange of some duration ; after which he pursued : "
78536	78544	78532	78534	that beautiful child	1326	" Then as she still said nothing : "
78554	78563	78548	78548	you	0	" Her answer in an instant rang clear . "
78574	78583	78584	78584	You	0	" It provoked in him a weak wail . "
78592	78593	78584	78584	You	0	" "
78619	78620	78615	78615	I	0	" "
78633	78742	78621	78621	You	0	" Most of the persons previously gathered had , in the interest of tea , passed into the house , and they had the gardens mainly to themselves . The shadows were long , the last call of the birds , who had made a home of their own in the noble interspaced quarter , sounded from the high trees in the other gardens as well , those of the old convent and of the old hotels ; it was as if our friends had waited for the full charm to come out . Strether 's impressions were still present ; it was as if something had happened that "
78744	78790	78615	78615	I	0	" them , made them more intense ; but he was to ask himself soon afterwards , that evening , what really HAD happened - conscious as he could after all remain that for a gentleman taken , and taken the first time , into the "
78794	79358	78615	78615	I	0	" the world of ambassadors and duchesses , the items made a meagre total . It was nothing new to him , however , as we know , that a man might have - at all events such a man as he - an amount of experience out of any proportion to his adventures ; so that , though it was doubtless no great adventure to sit on there with Miss Gostrey and hear about Madame de Vionnet , the hour , the picture , the immediate , the recent , the possible - as well as the communication itself , not a note of which failed to reverberate - only gave the moments more of the taste of history . It was history , to begin with , that Jeanne 's mother had been three - and - twenty years before , at Geneva , schoolmate and good girlfriend to Maria Gostrey , who had moreover enjoyed since then , though interruptedly and above all with a long recent drop , other glimpses of her . Twenty - three years put them both on , no doubt ; and Madame de Vionnet - though she had married straight after school - could n't be today an hour less than thirty - eight . This made her ten years older than Chad - though ten years , also , if Strether liked , older than she looked ; the least , at any rate , that a prospective mother - in - law could be expected to do with . She would be of all mothers - in - law the most charming ; unless indeed , through some perversity as yet insupposeable , she should utterly belie herself in that relation . There was none surely in which , as Maria remembered her , she must n't be charming ; and this frankly in spite of the stigma of failure in the tie where failure always most showed . It was no test there - when indeed WAS it a test there ? - for Monsieur de Vionnet had been a brute . She had lived for years apart from him - which was of course always a horrid position ; but Miss Gostrey 's impression of the matter had been that she could scarce have made a better thing of it had she done it on purpose to show she was amiable . She was so amiable that nobody had had a word to say ; which was luckily not the case for her husband . He was so impossible that she had the advantage of all her merits . It was still history for Strether that the Comte de Vionnet - it being also history that the lady in question was a Countess - should now , under Miss Gostrey 's sharp touch , rise before him as a high distinguished polished impertinent reprobate , the product of a mysterious order ; it was history , further , that the charming girl so freely sketched by his companion should have been married out of hand by a mother , another figure of striking outline , full of dark personal motive ; it was perhaps history most of all that this company was , as a matter of course , governed by such considerations as put divorce out of the question . "
79384	79693	79378	79378	they	1328	" ; a fact in the light of which they seemed but the more richly special . It was all special ; it was all , for Strether 's imagination , more or less rich . The girl at the Genevese school , an isolated interesting attaching creature , then both sensitive and violent , audacious but always forgiven , was the daughter of a French father and an English mother who , early left a widow , had married again - tried afresh with a foreigner ; in her career with whom she had apparently given her child no example of comfort . All these people - the people of the English mother 's side - had been of condition more or less eminent ; yet with oddities and disparities that had often since made Maria , thinking them over , wonder what they really quite rhymed to . It was in any case her belief that the mother , interested and prone to adventure , had been without conscience , had only thought of ridding herself most quickly of a possible , an actual encumbrance . The father , by her impression , a Frenchman with a name one knew , had been a different matter , leaving his child , she clearly recalled , a memory all fondness , as well as an assured little fortune which was unluckily to make her more or less of a prey later on . She had been in particular , at school , dazzlingly , though quite booklessly , clever ; as polyglot as a little Jewess which she was n't , oh no ! and chattering French , English , German , Italian , anything one would , in a way that made a clean sweep , if not of prizes and parchments , at least of every "
79696	79725	79378	79378	they	1328	" whether memorised or improvised , in the curtained costumed school repertory , and in especial of all mysteries of race and vagueness of reference , all swagger about "
79728	80183	79378	79378	they	1328	" among their variegated mates . It would doubtless be difficult to - day , as between French and English , to name her and place her ; she would certainly show , on knowledge , Miss Gostrey felt , as one of those convenient types who do n't keep you explaining - minds with doors as numerous as the many - tongued cluster of confessionals at Saint Peter 's . You might confess to her with confidence in Roumelian , and even Roumelian sins . Therefore - ! But Strether 's narrator covered her implication with a laugh ; a laugh by which his betrayal of a sense of the lurid in the picture was also perhaps sufficiently protected . He had a moment of wondering , while his friend went on , what sins might be especially Roumelian . She went on at all events to the mention of her having met the young thing - again by some Swiss lake - in her first married state , which had appeared for the few intermediate years not at least violently disturbed . She had been lovely at that moment , delightful to HER , full of responsive emotion , of amused recognitions and amusing reminders , and then once more , much later , after a long interval , equally but differently charming - touching and rather mystifying for the five minutes of an encounter at a railway - station en province , during which it had come out that her life was all changed . Miss Gostrey had understood enough to see , essentially , what had happened , and yet had beautifully dreamed that she was herself faultless . There were doubtless depths in her , but she was all right ; Strether would see if she was n't . She was another person however - that had been promptly marked - from the small child of nature at the Geneva school , a little person quite made over as foreign women WERE , compared with American by marriage . Her situation too had evidently cleared itself up ; there would have been - all that was possible - a judicial separation . She had settled in Paris , brought up her daughter , steered her boat . It was no very pleasant boat - especially there - to be in ; but Marie de Vionnet would have headed straight . She would have friends , certainly - and very good ones . There she was at all events - and it was very interesting . Her knowing Mr. Chad did n't in the least prove she had n't friends ; what it proved was what good ones HE had . "
80188	80193	79378	79378	they	1328	" said Miss Gostrey , "
80221	80226	80228	80228	you	1332	" she immediately added , "
80230	80231	80228	80228	you	1332	" "
80240	80244	80228	80228	you	1332	" Strether laughed . "
80249	80256	80258	80258	she	1331	" he as promptly went on , "
80267	80283	80284	80284	She	1331	" Miss Gostrey was on her feet ; it was time for them to go . "
80293	80333	80284	80284	She	1331	" Their eyes , as so often , in candid conference , through their settled glasses , met over it long ; after which Strether 's again took in the whole place . They were quite alone there now . "
80348	80349	80336	80336	she	1331	" "
80427	80444	80445	80445	She	1331	" Strether took this in as they slowly moved to the house on their way out . "
80456	80457	80460	80460	she	1331	" "
80473	80478	80480	80480	her	1331	" Miss Gostrey added , "
80487	80488	80480	80480	her	1331	" "
80491	80502	80480	80480	her	1331	" her friend returned , ' she caught Chad young ! "
80503	80528	80529	80529	She	0	" Yes , but there are women who are for all your ' times of life . ' They 're the most wonderful sort . "
80550	80566	80537	80537	they	1339	" Is what you mean that she 'll try to make a fool of me ? "
80567	80583	80480	80480	her	1331	" Well , I 'm wondering what she WILL - with an opportunity - make . "
80584	80590	80591	80591	Strether	82	" What do you call , "
80594	80604	80591	80591	Strether	82	" an opportunity ? My going to see her ? "
80605	80613	80480	80480	her	1331	" Ah you must go to see her "
80622	80660	80615	80616	Miss Gostrey	99	" You ca n't not do that . You 'd have gone to see the other woman . I mean if there had been one - a different sort . It 's what you came out for . "
80669	80680	80666	80666	Strether	82	" I did n't come out to see THIS sort . "
80690	80699	80681	80681	She	99	" Are you disappointed she is n't worse ? "
80717	80737	80700	80700	He	82	" Yes . If she were worse she 'd be better for our purpose . It would be simpler . "
80738	80741	80742	80742	she	99	" Perhaps , "
80745	80753	80742	80742	she	99	" But wo n't this be pleasanter ? "
80754	80759	80760	80760	he	82	" Ah you know , "
80764	80787	80760	80760	he	82	" I did n't come out - was n't that just what you originally reproached me with ? - for the pleasant . "
80788	80811	80812	80813	Miss Gostrey	99	" Precisely . Therefore I say again what I said at first . You must take things as they come . Besides , "
80816	80824	80812	80813	Miss Gostrey	99	" I 'm not afraid for myself . "
80825	80830	80871	80871	he	82	" For yourself - ? "
80831	80858	80859	80859	Strether	82	" Of your seeing her . I trust her . There 's nothing she 'll say about me . In fact there 's nothing she CAN . "
80875	80880	80871	80871	he	82	" Oh you women ! "
80891	80902	80888	80888	she	99	" Yes - there we are . We 're abysses . "
80908	80914	80905	80905	she	99	" But I risk her ! "
80921	80928	80917	80917	himself	82	" Well then so do I ! "
81082	81084	81074	81074	Chad	111	" away "
81311	81314	81320	81320	he	111	" See here "
81327	81331	81320	81320	he	111	" See here . "
81408	81417	81419	81419	he	82	" I want to know where I am . "
81430	81449	81419	81419	he	82	" Are you engaged to be married - is that your secret ? - to the young lady ? "
81473	81501	81452	81452	his	111	" I have no secret - though I may have secrets ! I have n't at any rate that one . We 're not engaged . No . "
81502	81509	81452	81452	his	111	" Then where 's the hitch ? "
81510	81523	81452	81452	his	111	" Do you mean why I have n't already started with you ? "
81540	81578	81579	81579	Strether	82	" Nothing would have induced me - nothing will still induce me - not to try to keep you here as long as you can be made to stay . It 's too visibly good for you . "
81646	81761	81762	81762	he	1362	" My idea - voyons ! - is simply that you should let Madame de Vionnet know you , simply that you should consent to know HER . I do n't in the least mind telling you that , clever and charming as she is , she 's ever so much in my confidence . All I ask of you is to let her talk to you . You 've asked me about what you call my hitch , and so far as it goes she 'll explain it to you . She 's herself my hitch , hang it - if you must really have it all out . But in a sense , "
81772	81806	81762	81762	he	1362	" that you 'll quite make out for yourself . She 's too good a friend , confound her . Too good , I mean , for me to leave without - without - "
81813	81817	81762	81762	he	1362	" Without what ? "
81818	81834	81762	81762	he	1362	" Well , without my arranging somehow or other the damnable terms of my sacrifice . "
81835	81843	81762	81762	he	1362	" It WILL be a sacrifice then ? "
81844	81861	81762	81762	he	1362	" It will be the greatest loss I ever suffered . I owe her so much . "

82129	82152	82153	82153	Chad	111	" Have I your word of honour that if I surrender myself to Madame de Vionnet you 'll surrender yourself to me ? "

82426	82433	82421	82421	Chad	111	" Are you afraid of her ? "
82434	82444	82453	82453	she	85	" Oh immensely . Do n't you see it ? "
82445	82448	82450	82450	Chad	111	" Well , "

82677	82704	82669	82669	they	1381	" Again Strether had faltered , but it was brief . It was all very well , but there was nothing now he would n't risk . "

82735	82746	82726	82726	she	1043	" - Chad echoed it , but without a shock . "
82754	82755	82726	82726	she	1043	" "
82761	82864	82726	82726	she	1043	" Strether felt a little silly , and was even conscious of a foolish laugh , at having it imposed on him to have appeared to speak so . What indeed was he talking about ? His stare had relaxed ; he looked now all round him . But something in him brought him back , though he still did n't know quite how to turn it . The two or three ways he thought of , and one of them in particular , were , even with scruples dismissed , too ugly . He none the less at last found something . "
82871	82923	82866	82866	her	1043	" It struck him , directly he had found it , as pompous and priggish ; so much so that he was thankful to Chad for taking it only in the right spirit . The young man spoke so immensely to the point that the effect was practically of positive blandness . "
82936	83035	83036	83036	I	0	" These last words were , in the liberality of their confidence , so imperative that Strether went through no form of assent ; but before they separated it had been confirmed that he should be picked up at a quarter to five . Book Sixth I It was quite by half - past five - after the two men had been together in Madame de Vionnet 's drawing - room not more than a dozen minutes - that Chad , with a look at his watch and then another at their hostess , said genially , gaily : "
83066	83072	83064	83064	her	1384	" he declared to Strether , "
83089	83747	83084	83084	she	1384	" He had left them to be embarrassed or not by this guarantee , as they could best manage , and embarrassment was a thing that Strether was n't at first sure Madame de Vionnet escaped . He escaped it himself , to his surprise ; but he had grown used by this time to thinking of himself as brazen . She occupied , his hostess , in the Rue de Bellechasse , the first floor of an old house to which our visitors had had access from an old clean court . The court was large and open , full of revelations , for our friend , of the habit of privacy , the peace of intervals , the dignity of distances and approaches ; the house , to his restless sense , was in the high homely style of an elder day , and the ancient Paris that he was always looking for - sometimes intensely felt , sometimes more acutely missed - was in the immemorial polish of the wide waxed staircase and in the fine boiseries , the medallions , mouldings , mirrors , great clear spaces , of the greyish - white salon into which he had been shown . He seemed at the very outset to see her in the midst of possessions not vulgarly numerous , but hereditary cherished charming . While his eyes turned after a little from those of his hostess and Chad freely talked - not in the least about HIM , but about other people , people he did n't know , and quite as if he did know them - he found himself making out , as a background of the occupant , some glory , some prosperity of the First Empire , some Napoleonic glamour , some dim lustre of the great legend ; elements clinging still to all the consular chairs and mythological brasses and sphinxes ' heads and faded surfaces of satin striped with alternate silk . The place itself went further back - that he guessed , and how old Paris continued in a manner to echo there ; but the post - revolutionary period , the world he vaguely thought of as the world of Chateaubriand , of Madame de Stael , even of the young Lamartine , had left its stamp of harps and urns and torches , a stamp impressed on sundry small objects , ornaments and relics . He had never before , to his knowledge , had present to him relics , of any special dignity , of a private order - little old miniatures , medallions , pictures , books ; books in leather bindings , pinkish and greenish , with gilt garlands on the back , ranged , together with other promiscuous properties , under the glass of brass - mounted cabinets . His attention took them all tenderly into account . They were among the matters that marked Madame de Vionnet 's apartment as something quite different from Miss Gostrey 's little museum of bargains and from Chad 's lovely home ; he recognised it as founded much more on old accumulations that had possibly from time to time shrunken than on any contemporary method of acquisition or form of curiosity . Chad and Miss Gostrey had rummaged and purchased and picked up and exchanged , sifting , selecting , comparing ; whereas the mistress of the scene before him , beautifully passive under the spell of transmission - transmission from her father 's line , he quite made up his mind - had only received , accepted and been quiet . When she had n't been quiet she had been moved at the most to some occult charity for some fallen fortune . There had been objects she or her predecessors might even conceivably have parted with under need , but Strether could n't suspect them of having sold old pieces to get "
83749	84314	84556	84556	you	1385	" ones . They would have felt no difference as to better or worse . He could but imagine their having felt - perhaps in emigration , in proscription , for his sketch was slight and confused - the pressure of want or the obligation of sacrifice . The pressure of want - whatever might be the case with the other force - was , however , presumably not active now , for the tokens of a chastened ease still abounded after all , many marks of a taste whose discriminations might perhaps have been called eccentric . He guessed at intense little preferences and sharp little exclusions , a deep suspicion of the vulgar and a personal view of the right . The general result of this was something for which he had no name on the spot quite ready , but something he would have come nearest to naming in speaking of it as the air of supreme respectability , the consciousness , small , still , reserved , but none the less distinct and diffused , of private honour . The air of supreme respectability - that was a strange blank wall for his adventure to have brought him to break his nose against . It had in fact , as he was now aware , filled all the approaches , hovered in the court as he passed , hung on the staircase as he mounted , sounded in the grave rumble of the old bell , as little electric as possible , of which Chad , at the door , had pulled the ancient but neatly - kept tassel ; it formed in short the clearest medium of its particular kind that he had ever breathed . He would have answered for it at the end of a quarter of an hour that some of the glass cases contained swords and epaulettes of ancient colonels and generals ; medals and orders once pinned over hearts that had long since ceased to beat ; snuff - boxes bestowed on ministers and envoys ; copies of works presented , with inscriptions , by authors now classic . At bottom of it all for him was the sense of her rare unlikeness to the women he had known . This sense had grown , since the day before , the more he recalled her , and had been above all singularly fed by his talk with Chad in the morning . Everything in fine made her immeasurably new , and nothing so new as the old house and the old objects . There were books , two or three , on a small table near his chair , but they had n't the lemon - coloured covers with which his eye had begun to dally from the hour of his arrival and to the opportunity of a further acquaintance with which he had for a fortnight now altogether succumbed . On another table , across the room , he made out the great Revue ; but even that familiar face , conspicuous in Mrs. Newsome 's parlours , scarce counted here as a modern note . He was sure on the spot - and he afterwards knew he was right - that this was a touch of Chad 's own hand . What would Mrs. Newsome say to the circumstance that Chad 's interested "
84316	84513	84514	84514	I	0	" kept her paper - knife in the Revue ? The interested influence at any rate had , as we say , gone straight to the point - had in fact soon left it quite behind . She was seated , near the fire , on a small stuffed and fringed chair one of the few modern articles in the room , and she leaned back in it with her hands clasped in her lap and no movement , in all her person , but the fine prompt play of her deep young face . The fire , under the low white marble , undraped and academic , had burnt down to the silver ashes of light wood , one of the windows , at a distance , stood open to the mildness and stillness , out of which , in the short pauses , came the faint sound , pleasant and homely , almost rustic , of a plash and a clatter of sabots from some coach - house on the other side of the court . Madame de Vionnet , while Strether sat there , was n't to shift her posture by an inch . "
84527	84531	84523	84523	you	1385	" she said ; "
84552	84553	84540	84540	I	0	" "
84559	84564	84568	84568	you	1385	" Strether directly replied , "
84589	84590	84585	84585	you	1385	" "
84593	84605	84585	84585	you	1385	" she said , taking that menace bravely and philosophically enough , "
84621	84622	84614	84614	you	1385	" "
84629	84650	84625	84625	I	0	" he immediately returned . It gave her another pause ; which , however , she happily enough shook off . "
84669	84761	84652	84652	you	1385	" Then it was that he saw how she had decidedly come all the way ; and there accompanied it an extraordinary sense of her raising from somewhere below him her beautiful suppliant eyes . He might have been perched at his door - step or at his window and she standing in the road . For a moment he let her stand and could n't moreover have spoken . It had been sad , of a sudden , with a sadness that was like a cold breath in his face . "
84767	84772	84764	84764	I	0	" he finally asked , "
84782	84783	84778	84778	I	0	" "
84792	84797	84787	84787	I	0	" she quickly said , "
84807	84825	84801	84802	Mr. Newsome	114	" She spoke at present , he saw , as if to take courageously ALL her risk . "
84836	84861	84828	84828	my	0	" It gave poor Strether in truth - uneasy as it made him too - something of the thrill of a bold perception justified . "
84864	84870	84828	84828	my	0	" he answered kindly enough , "
84888	84903	84904	84904	I	0	" She seemed still to look up at him , but now more serenely . "
84922	84926	84919	84919	you	0	" she continued , "
84932	84933	84919	84919	you	0	" "
84959	84960	84953	84953	I	0	" "
84999	85007	85274	85274	Chad	111	" she said with a wonderful smile , "
85012	85204	85205	85205	You	1387	" Strether had a long pause while they sat again face to face , as they had sat , scarce less conscious , before the poor lady had crossed the stream . She was the poor lady for Strether now because clearly she had some trouble , and her appeal to him could only mean that her trouble was deep . He could n't help it ; it was n't his fault ; he had done nothing ; but by a turn of the hand she had somehow made their encounter a relation . And the relation profited by a mass of things that were not strictly in it or of it ; by the very air in which they sat , by the high cold delicate room , by the world outside and the little plash in the court , by the First Empire and the relics in the stiff cabinets , by matters as far off as those and by others as near as the unbroken clasp of her hands in her lap and the look her expression had of being most natural when her eyes were most fixed . "
85220	85221	85205	85205	You	1387	" "
85229	85270	85205	85205	You	1387	" she laughed at this . He found himself in time on the point of telling her that she was , as Miss Barrace called it , wonderful ; but , catching himself up , he said something else instead . "
85285	85286	85288	85288	his	111	" "
85309	85310	85311	85313	The ' woman	1390	" "
85317	85322	85311	85313	The ' woman	1390	" Strether slowly echoed . "
85351	85364	85347	85347	she	629	" Strether followed it ; then with an abruptness of his own : "
85372	85373	85368	85368	you	0	" "
85390	85401	85402	85402	I	0	" But she got at once again away from this . "
85428	85434	85423	85423	I	0	" she went on wonderfully , "
85464	85465	85454	85454	I	0	" "
85474	85481	85484	85484	I	0	" he observed after an instant , "
85490	85491	85484	85484	I	0	" "
85494	85500	85502	85502	you	0	" she so far assented , "
85519	85520	85521	85521	You	0	" "
85535	85539	85529	85529	I	0	" Strether pursued . "
85617	85618	85606	85606	I	0	" "
85627	85633	85634	85635	Mrs. Newsome	88	" Madame de Vionnet laughed . "
85637	85644	85634	85635	Mrs. Newsome	88	" she added in another tone , "
85654	85667	85670	85670	she	1393	" He had an hesitation , but he brought the words out . "
85675	85676	85670	85670	she	1393	" "
85684	85691	85678	85678	you	0	" But she also hung fire . "
85697	85703	85693	85693	I	0	" She still rather faltered . "
85739	85740	85693	85693	I	0	" "
85745	85765	85693	85693	I	0	" he insisted as after thus beating about the bush she had again dropped . She made the effort . "
85772	85788	85767	85767	she	1393	" He was amazed afterwards to think how simply and quietly he had met it . "
85792	85818	85767	85767	she	1393	" It was almost as if he were a trifle disappointed - had expected still more of her freedom . But he went straight on . "
85831	85843	85822	85822	Chad	111	" She was evidently charmed with the way he took it . "
85875	85876	85845	85845	you	0	" "
85891	85892	85886	85887	a woman	3063	" "
85895	85899	85900	85900	you	0	" she exclaimed - "
85939	85969	85970	85970	I	0	" Strether was silent a little ; then he found himself speaking with a cynicism of confidence of which even at the moment the sources were strange to him . "
85982	85986	85988	85988	YOU	0	" he exclaimed , "
85994	86002	85988	85988	YOU	0	" Oh she was able to say . "
86029	86030	86022	86022	He	114	" "
86039	86348	86033	86033	I	0	" our friend briskly interrupted . Deep and beautiful on this her smile came back , and with the effect of making him hear what he had said just as she had heard it . He easily enough felt that it gave him away , but what in truth had everything done but that ? It had been all very well to think at moments that he was holding her nose down and that he had coerced her : what had he by this time done but let her practically see that he accepted their relation ? What was their relation moreover - though light and brief enough in form as yet - but whatever she might choose to make it ? Nothing could prevent her - certainly he could n't - from making it pleasant . At the back of his head , behind everything , was the sense that she was - there , before him , close to him , in vivid imperative form - one of the rare women he had so often heard of , read of , thought of , but never met , whose very presence , look , voice , the mere contemporaneous FACT of whom , from the moment it was at all presented , made a relation of mere recognition . That was not the kind of woman he had ever found Mrs. Newsome , a contemporaneous fact who had been distinctly slow to establish herself ; and at present , confronted with Madame de Vionnet , he felt the simplicity of his original impression of Miss Gostrey . She certainly had been a fact of rapid growth ; but the world was wide , each day was more and more a new lesson . There were at any rate even among the stranger ones relations and relations . "
86358	86363	86353	86353	Chad	111	" he quickly added . "
86375	86406	86364	86364	He	111	" She seemed to deny a little , on the young man 's behalf , by the rise of her eyebrows , an intention of any process at all inconsiderate . "
86431	86440	86422	86422	He	111	" Strether wondered with his eyes on her . "
86469	86470	86463	86463	you	0	" "
86477	86478	86463	86463	you	0	" "
86487	86488	86482	86482	you	0	" "
86509	86510	86503	86503	I	0	" "
86519	86527	86516	86516	I	0	" Strether laughed with a slight harshness , "
86534	86550	86516	86516	I	0	" But she insisted kindly , gently , as if it was n't so bad . "
86559	86560	86516	86516	I	0	" "
86563	86568	86516	86516	I	0	" he oddly echoed . "
86575	86582	86516	86516	I	0	" Madame de Vionnet again pleaded . "
86602	86617	86619	86619	her	3001	" She looked about a while , but presently she came back to him . "
86628	86635	86636	86636	You	0	" Strether meanwhile had been staring . "
86641	86642	86636	86636	You	0	" "
86653	86659	86660	86660	you	0	" she just slightly quavered , "
86664	86665	86662	86662	us	1399	" "
86676	86683	86651	86651	her	3001	" - he caught himself up - "
86691	86696	86689	86689	YOU	0	" She looked graver . "
86704	86708	86709	86709	She	3001	" Strether debated . "
86721	86722	86709	86709	She	3001	" "
86725	86740	86741	86741	He	1401	" she charmingly contended , ' she sent you out to face the facts . "
86753	86772	86773	86773	he	1401	" But how can I face them till I know what they are ? Do you want him , "
86780	86786	86776	86776	himself	1401	" to marry your daughter ? "
86798	86804	86787	86787	She	3001	" No - not that . "
86805	86815	86816	86816	She	3001	" And he really does n't want to himself ? "
86831	86838	86828	86828	her	3001	" He likes her too much . "
86842	86860	86828	86828	her	3001	" To be willing to consider , you mean , the question of taking her to America ? "
86861	86899	86900	86900	Strether	82	" To be willing to do anything with her but be immensely kind and nice - really tender of her . We watch over her , and you must help us . You must see her again . "
86904	86915	86916	86917	The mother	758	" Ah with pleasure - she 's so remarkably attractive . "
86941	86949	86952	86952	he	82	" The dear thing DID please you ? "
86958	86961	86900	86900	Strether	82	" Oh ! "
86965	86975	86952	86952	he	82	" She 's perfect . She 's my joy . "
86976	87000	86900	86900	Strether	82	" Well , I 'm sure that - if one were near her and saw more of her - she 'd be mine . "
87001	87004	87006	87008	Madame de Vionnet	85	" Then , "
87010	87016	87006	87008	Madame de Vionnet	85	" tell Mrs. Newsome that ! "
87022	87030	87032	87032	she	85	" What good will that do you ? "
87048	87058	87042	87042	he	82	" Is your daughter in love with our friend ? "
87059	87062	87063	87063	she	85	" Ah , "
87068	87076	87063	87063	she	85	" I wish you 'd find out ! "
87082	87088	87077	87077	He	82	" I ? A stranger ? "
87089	87116	87042	87042	he	82	" Oh you wo n't be a stranger - presently . You shall see her quite , I assure you , as if you were n't . "
87128	87141	87077	87077	He	82	" It seems to me surely that if her mother ca n't - "
87142	87153	87154	87154	she	1403	" Ah little girls and their mothers to - day ! "
87179	87196	87161	87161	she	1403	" Tell her I 've been good for him . Do n't you think I have ? "
87220	87229	87214	87214	he	82	" Oh if it 's all you - ! "
87230	87241	87242	87242	she	1403	" Well , it may not be ' all , ' "
87245	87258	87259	87259	she	1403	" but it 's to a great extent . Really and truly , "
87276	87283	87259	87259	she	1403	" Then it 's very wonderful . "
87315	87326	87310	87310	she	1403	" Well , do n't you think that for that - "
87327	87334	87310	87310	she	1403	" I ought to save you ? "
87383	87392	87366	87366	himself	82	" I 'll save you if I can . "
87482	87505	87506	87506	he	2833	" I should like so awfully to know what you think of her . It will really be a chance for you , "
87510	87580	87506	87506	he	2833	" to see the jeune fille - I mean the type - as she actually is , and I do n't think that , as an observer of manners , it 's a thing you ought to miss . It will be an impression that - whatever else you take - you can carry home with you , where you 'll find again so much to compare it with . "
87916	87937	87940	87940	himself	82	" Well , what can I do more than that - what can I do more than tell her everything ? "
88052	88063	88040	88040	he	82	" She knows it NOW - even while I worry . "
88274	88282	88269	88269	he	82	" Thank you very much - impossible . "
88326	88458	88317	88318	Mrs. Newsome	88	" Madame de Vionnet ; but , so far as he was concerned with that reminiscence , he had n't at any rate promised to haunt her house . What Chad had understood could only , in truth , be inferred from Chad 's behaviour , which had been in this connexion as easy as in every other . He was easy , always , when he understood ; he was easier still , if possible , when he did n't ; he had replied that he would make it all right ; and he had proceeded to do this by substituting the present occasion - as he was ready to substitute others - for any , for every occasion as to which his old friend should have a funny scruple . "
88479	88655	88469	88469	I	0	" Jeanne de Vionnet had said to him as soon as , in the petit salon , he sank , shyly enough on his own side , into the place near her vacated by Madame Gloriani at his approach . Madame Gloriani , who was in black velvet , with white lace and powdered hair , and whose somewhat massive majesty melted , at any contact , into the graciousness of some incomprehensible tongue , moved away to make room for the vague gentleman , after benevolent greetings to him which embodied , as he believed , in baffling accents , some recognition of his face from a couple of Sundays before . Then he had remarked - making the most of the advantage of his years - that it frightened him quite enough to find himself dedicated to the entertainment of a little foreign girl . There were girls he was n't afraid of - he was quite bold with little Americans . Thus it was that she had defended herself to the end - "
88699	88837	88690	88690	She	1421	" She was fairly beautiful to him - a faint pastel in an oval frame : he thought of her already as of some lurking image in a long gallery , the portrait of a small old - time princess of whom nothing was known but that she had died young . Little Jeanne was n't , doubtless , to die young , but one could n't , all the same , bear on her lightly enough . It was bearing hard , it was bearing as HE , in any case , would n't bear , to concern himself , in relation to her , with the question of a young man . Odious really the question of a young man ; one did n't treat such a person as a maid - servant suspected of a "
88840	89376	88690	88690	She	1421	" And then young men , young men - well , the thing was their business simply , or was at all events hers . She was fluttered , fairly fevered - to the point of a little glitter that came and went in her eyes and a pair of pink spots that stayed in her cheeks - with the great adventure of dining out and with the greater one still , possibly , of finding a gentleman whom she must think of as very , very old , a gentleman with eye - glasses , wrinkles , a long grizzled moustache . She spoke the prettiest English , our friend thought , that he had ever heard spoken , just as he had believed her a few minutes before to be speaking the prettiest French . He wondered almost wistfully if such a sweep of the lyre did n't react on the spirit itself ; and his fancy had in fact , before he knew it , begun so to stray and embroider that he finally found himself , absent and extravagant , sitting with the child in a friendly silence . Only by this time he felt her flutter to have fortunately dropped and that she was more at her ease . She trusted him , liked him , and it was to come back to him afterwards that she had told him things . She had dipped into the waiting medium at last and found neither surge nor chill - nothing but the small splash she could herself make in the pleasant warmth , nothing but the safety of dipping and dipping again . At the end of the ten minutes he was to spend with her his impression - with all it had thrown off and all it had taken in - was complete . She had been free , as she knew freedom , partly to show him that , unlike other little persons she knew , she had imbibed that ideal . She was delightfully quaint about herself , but the vision of what she had imbibed was what most held him . It really consisted , he was soon enough to feel , in just one great little matter , the fact that , whatever her nature , she was thoroughly - he had to cast about for the word , but it came - bred . He could n't of course on so short an acquaintance speak for her nature , but the idea of breeding was what she had meanwhile dropped into his mind . He had never yet known it so sharply presented . Her mother gave it , no doubt ; but her mother , to make that less sensible , gave so much else besides , and on neither of the two previous occasions , extraordinary woman , Strether felt , anything like what she was giving tonight . Little Jeanne was a case , an exquisite case of education ; whereas the Countess , whom it so amused him to think of by that denomination , was a case , also exquisite , of - well , he did n't know what . "
89385	89880	88690	88690	She	1421	" : this was what Gloriani said to him on turning away from the inspection of a small picture suspended near the door of the room . The high celebrity in question had just come in , apparently in search of Mademoiselle de Vionnet , but while Strether had got up from beside her their fellow guest , with his eye sharply caught , had paused for a long look . The thing was a landscape , of no size , but of the French school , as our friend was glad to feel he knew , and also of a quality - which he liked to think he should also have guessed ; its frame was large out of proportion to the canvas , and he had never seen a person look at anything , he thought , just as Gloriani , with his nose very near and quick movements of the head from side to side and bottom to top , examined this feature of Chad 's collection . The artist used that word the next moment smiling courteously , wiping his nippers and looking round him further - paying the place in short by the very manner of his presence and by something Strether fancied he could make out in this particular glance , such a tribute as , to the latter 's sense , settled many things once for all . Strether was conscious at this instant , for that matter , as he had n't yet been , of how , round about him , quite without him , they WERE consistently settled . Gloriani 's smile , deeply Italian , he considered , and finely inscrutable , had had for him , during dinner , at which they were not neighbours , an indefinite greeting ; but the quality in it was gone that had appeared on the other occasion to turn him inside out ; it was as if even the momentary link supplied by the doubt between them had snapped . He was conscious now of the final reality , which was that there was n't so much a doubt as a difference altogether ; all the more that over the difference the famous sculptor seemed to signal almost condolingly , yet oh how vacantly ! as across some great flat sheet of water . He threw out the bridge of a charming hollow civility on which Strether would n't have trusted his own full weight a moment . That idea , even though but transient and perhaps belated , had performed the office of putting Strether more at his ease , and the blurred picture had already dropped - dropped with the sound of something else said and with his becoming aware , by another quick turn , that Gloriani was now on the sofa talking with Jeanne , while he himself had in his ears again the familiar friendliness and the elusive meaning of the "
89887	90100	88690	88690	She	1421	" that had made him , a fortnight before , challenge Miss Barrace in vain . She had always the air , this picturesque and original lady , who struck him , so oddly , as both antique and modern - she had always the air of taking up some joke that one had already had out with her . The point itself , no doubt , was what was antique , and the use she made of it what was modern . He felt just now that her good - natured irony did bear on something , and it troubled him a little that she would n't be more explicit only assuring him , with the pleasure of observation so visible in her , that she would n't tell him more for the world . He could take refuge but in asking her what she had done with Waymarsh , though it must be added that he felt himself a little on the way to a clue after she had answered that this personage was , in the other room , engaged in conversation with Madame de Vionnet . He stared a moment at the image of such a conjunction ; then , for Miss Barrace 's benefit , he wondered . "
90110	90111	90102	90102	she	1424	" "
90117	90124	90102	90102	she	1424	" - Miss Barrace was prompt . "

90147	90158	90135	90135	She	1424	" Strether laughed , ' she ca n't do everything . "
90207	90256	90257	90257	Strether	82	" said Miss Barrace , ' seen her fail with any one before . And to - night , when she 's so magnificent , it would seem to her strange - if she minded . So at any rate I have him all . Je suis tranquille ! "
90274	90285	90267	90267	he	82	" She strikes you to - night as particularly magnificent ? "
90286	90308	90309	90309	He	82	" Surely . Almost as I 've never seen her . Does n't she you ? Why it 's FOR you . "
90315	90322	90309	90309	He	82	" ' For ' me - ? "
90323	90330	90332	90333	Miss Barrace	131	" Oh , oh , oh ! "
90344	90347	90348	90348	he	82	" Well , "

90367	90372	90363	90363	She	1427	" Miss Barrace laughed . "

90391	90395	90374	90374	she	1427	" said Strether , "
90409	90442	90448	90448	her	1427	" His companion , with renewed mirth and the finest sense , between the puffs of her cigarette , of the drollery of things , appeared to find their conversation highly delightful . "
90451	90452	90448	90448	her	1427	" "
90458	90463	90468	90468	SHE	1427	" Strether earnestly enquired . "
90482	90483	90488	90488	her	1427	" "
90499	90500	90492	90492	we	1428	" "
90503	90533	90492	90492	we	1428	" Miss Barrace explained , ' she 's just brilliant , as we used to say . That 's all . She 's various . She 's fifty women . "
90534	90539	90541	90541	Strether	82	" Ah but only one "
90546	90551	90541	90541	Strether	82	" at a time . "
90552	90561	90492	90492	we	1428	" Perhaps . But in fifty times - ! "
90562	90571	90580	90580	he	235	" Oh we sha n't come to that , "
90587	90601	90580	90580	he	235	" Will you answer me a plain question ? Will she ever divorce ? "
90614	90619	90602	90603	Miss Barrace	131	" Why should she ? "
90639	90644	90633	90633	he	235	" To marry Chad . "
90645	90652	90602	90603	Miss Barrace	131	" Why should she marry Chad ? "
90653	90672	90602	90603	Miss Barrace	131	" Because I 'm convinced she 's very fond of him . She has done wonders for him . "
90673	90691	90633	90633	he	235	" Well then , how could she do more ? Marrying a man , or woman either , "
90698	90723	90692	90693	Miss Barrace	131	" is never the wonder for any Jack and Jill can bring THAT off . The wonder is their doing such things without marrying . "
90731	90747	90724	90724	Strether	82	" You mean it 's so beautiful for our friends simply to go on so ? "
90756	90759	90760	90760	He	82	" Beautiful . "
90764	90772	90760	90760	He	82	" And THAT because it 's disinterested ? "
90785	90805	90806	90806	she	131	" Yes then - call it that . Besides , she 'll never divorce . Do n't , moreover , "
90809	90818	90806	90806	she	131	" believe everything you hear about her husband . "
90819	90825	90826	90826	Strether	82	" He 's not then , "
90829	90833	90826	90826	Strether	82	" a wretch ? "
90834	90841	90760	90760	He	82	" Oh yes . But charming . "
90842	90848	90806	90806	she	131	" Do you know him ? "
90849	90860	90826	90826	Strether	82	" I 've met him . He 's bien aimable . "
90861	90869	90760	90760	He	82	" To every one but his wife ? "
90870	90895	90896	90896	she	131	" Oh for all I know , to her too - to any , to every woman . I hope you at any rate , "
90903	90913	90896	90896	she	131	" appreciate the care I take of Mr. Waymarsh . "
90914	90918	90760	90760	He	82	" Oh immensely . "
90927	90932	90933	90933	he	82	" At all events , "
90938	90946	90933	90933	he	82	" the attachment 's an innocent one . "
90947	90954	90955	90955	she	131	" Mine and his ? Ah , "
90958	90967	90955	90955	she	131	" do n't rob it of ALL interest ! "
90968	90985	90989	90989	he	82	" I mean our friend 's here - to the lady we 've been speaking of . "
91017	91022	91023	91023	he	82	" It 's innocent , "
91026	91033	91023	91023	he	82	" I see the whole thing . "
91142	91155	91136	91136	she	131	" All right with Mr. Newsome ? Why of course she is ! "
91171	91285	91158	91158	she	131	" I dare say you 're surprised that I 'm not worn out with all I see - it being so much ! - of Sitting Bull . But I 'm not , you know - I do n't mind him ; I bear up , and we get on beautifully . I 'm very strange ; I 'm like that ; and often I ca n't explain . There are people who are supposed interesting or remarkable or whatever , and who bore me to death ; and then there are others as to whom nobody can understand what anybody sees in them - in whom I see no end of things . "
91294	91302	91303	91303	she	1432	" He 's touching , you know , "
91306	91311	91312	91312	Strether	82	" ' Know ' ? "
91315	91330	91312	91312	Strether	82	" do n't I , indeed ? We must move you almost to tears . "
91331	91340	91341	91341	she	1432	" Oh but I do n't mean YOU ! "
91344	91380	91341	91341	she	1432	" You ought to then , for the worst sign of all - as I must have it for you - is that you ca n't help me . That 's when a woman pities . "
91381	91389	91390	91390	she	1432	" Ah but I do help you ! "
91407	91413	91395	91395	he	82	" No you do n't ! "
91427	91441	91395	91395	he	82	" I help you with Sitting Bull . That 's a good deal . "
91442	91448	91395	91395	he	82	" Oh that , yes . "
91453	91462	91450	91450	Strether	82	" Do you mean he talks of me ? "
91463	91477	91395	91395	he	82	" So that I have to defend you ? No , never . ' "
91481	91485	91395	91395	he	82	" Strether mused . "
91491	91492	91395	91395	he	82	" "
91499	91503	91450	91450	Strether	82	" she returned - "
91569	91585	91591	91591	We	1434	" She smoked again as she thus , with amused complacency , appreciated her acquisition . "
91611	91615	91616	91616	he	82	" she continued : "
91623	91624	91616	91616	he	82	" "
91627	91647	91616	91616	he	82	" poor Strether echoed , conscious with a pang that HE had n't yet tried that in any quarter . "
91652	91656	91657	91657	he	82	" she explained , "
91746	91747	91748	91748	He	82	" "
91756	91776	91748	91748	He	82	" Strether almost gasped at all he himself had n't thought of . He had a sense of admiration . "
91790	91794	91778	91778	he	82	" he mused , "
91801	91802	91778	91778	he	82	" "
91809	91835	91778	91778	he	82	" - and Miss Barrace , who had n't before heard this term applied , recognised its bearing with a clap of her gemmed hands . "
91879	91880	91874	91874	I	0	" "
91883	91901	91874	91874	I	0	" Strether echoed again with a rueful reflexion . How many nosegays had her present converser sent ? "
91905	91909	91874	91874	I	0	" she pursued , "
91940	91941	91936	91936	he	82	" "
91950	91955	91942	91942	He	82	" her friend smiled , "
91964	92035	91961	91961	his	82	" But Strether had swung back to the consciousness that for himself after all it never would have done . Waymarsh had n't Mrs. Waymarsh in the least to consider , whereas Lambert Strether had constantly , in the inmost honour of his thoughts , to consider Mrs. Newsome . He liked moreover to feel how much his friend was in the real tradition . Yet he had his conclusion . "
92042	92049	91961	91961	his	82	" He had worked it out . "
92055	92064	91961	91961	his	82	" She followed , but at a distance . "
92075	92076	92079	92079	he	82	" "
92098	92099	92100	92100	You	0	" "
92104	92115	92100	92100	You	0	" She showed doubt , and her laugh confirmed it . "
92122	92123	92100	92100	You	0	" "
92141	92142	92130	92130	I	0	" "
92156	92157	92130	92130	I	0	" "
92163	92195	92198	92199	Miss Gostrey	99	" he asked before she had had time to say . His tone had the effect of making her hesitate and even , as he guessed , speak with a difference . "
92208	92215	92203	92203	you	0	" It really made him wonder . "
92220	92701	92702	92702	You	1442	" III Madame de Vionnet , having meanwhile come in , was at present close to them , and Miss Barrace hereupon , instead of risking a rejoinder , became again with a look that measured her from top to toe all mere long - handled appreciative tortoise - shell . She had struck our friend , from the first of her appearing , as dressed for a great occasion , and she met still more than on either of the others the conception reawakened in him at their garden - party , the idea of the femme du monde in her habit as she lived . Her bare shoulders and arms were white and beautiful ; the materials of her dress , a mixture , as he supposed , of silk and crape , were of a silvery grey so artfully composed as to give an impression of warm splendour ; and round her neck she wore a collar of large old emeralds , the green note of which was more dimly repeated , at other points of her apparel , in embroidery , in enamel , in satin , in substances and textures vaguely rich . Her head , extremely fair and exquisitely festal , was like a happy fancy , a notion of the antique , on an old precious medal , some silver coin of the Renaissance ; while her slim lightness and brightness , her gaiety , her expression , her decision , contributed to an effect that might have been felt by a poet as half mythological and half conventional . He could have compared her to a goddess still partly engaged in a morning cloud , or to a sea - nymph waist - high in the summer surge . Above all she suggested to him the reflexion that the femme du monde - in these finest developments of the type - was , like Cleopatra in the play , indeed various and multifold . She had aspects , characters , days , nights - or had them at least , showed them by a mysterious law of her own , when in addition to everything she happened also to be a woman of genius . She was an obscure person , a muffled person one day , and a showy person , an uncovered person the next . He thought of Madame de Vionnet to - night as showy and uncovered , though he felt the formula rough , because , thanks to one of the short - cuts of genius she had taken all his categories by surprise . Twice during dinner he had met Chad 's eyes in a longish look ; but these communications had in truth only stirred up again old ambiguities - so little was it clear from them whether they were an appeal or an admonition . "
92709	92738	92702	92702	You	1442	" was what they appeared to convey ; yet how he was fixed was exactly what Strether did n't see . However , perhaps he should see now . "
92816	92899	92805	92805	I	0	" She made this proposal to Miss Barrace as if her consciousness of a special duty had just flickered - up , but that lady 's recognition of Strether 's little start at it - as at a betrayal on the speaker 's part of a domesticated state - was as mute as his own comment ; and after an instant , when their fellow guest had good - naturedly left them , he had been given something else to think of . "
92911	92924	92908	92908	you	82	" That was the question Madame de Vionnet had brought with her . "
92964	92965	92968	92968	she	162	" "
92974	92975	92968	92968	she	162	" "
92998	93002	92989	92989	she	162	" Strether explained - "
93052	93079	93080	93080	She	162	" Madame de Vionnet listened with interest and with her eyes on Strether 's face ; then her delicately decorated head had a small melancholy motion . "
93093	93097	93087	93087	I	0	" she added , "
93184	93193	93173	93173	She	162	" she continued with a beautiful conscious mildness , "
93234	93339	93223	93223	I	0	" Strether still said nothing ; he had a horror , as he now thought of himself , of being in question between women - was in fact already quite enough on his way to that , and there was moreover , as it came to him , perceptibly , something behind these allusions and professions that , should he take it in , would square but ill with his present resolve to simplify . It was as if , for him , all the same , her softness and sadness were sincere . He felt that not less when she soon went on : "
93348	93401	93340	93340	I	0	" But it also left him mute - sharp and fine though the imputation it conveyed . What it conveyed was that HE was Maria Gostrey 's happiness , and for the least little instant he had the impulse to challenge the thought . He could have done so however only by saying "
93412	93534	93405	93405	you	1452	" and he was wonderfully glad a moment later not to have spoken . He would rather seem stupid any day than fatuous , and he drew back as well , with a smothered inward shudder , from the consideration of what women - of highly - developed type in particular - might think of each other . Whatever he had come out for he had n't come to go into that ; so that he absolutely took up nothing his interlocutress had now let drop . Yet , though he had kept away from her for days , had laid wholly on herself the burden of their meeting again , she had n't a gleam of irritation to show him . "
93541	93589	93538	93538	Jeanne	150	" she smiled - it had the gaiety with which she had originally come in . He felt it on the instant to represent her motive and real errand . But he had been schooling her of a truth to say much in proportion to his little . "
93606	93617	93603	93604	Mr. Newsome	114	" Almost resentful , Strether could at last be prompt . "
93626	93634	93620	93620	I	0	" She remained perfectly good - natured . "
93661	93665	93659	93659	you	1454	" she asked , "
93671	93672	93659	93659	you	1454	" "
93685	93686	93688	93688	you	1454	" "
93696	93708	93688	93688	you	1454	" she reassuringly declared . But she immediately changed her ground . "
93720	93721	93713	93713	your	1454	" "
93733	93734	93729	93729	you	1454	" "
93744	93748	93741	93741	You	1454	" she insisted . "
93754	93758	93749	93749	You	0	" He wondered . "
93770	93776	93767	93767	I	0	" She kept it up . "
93787	93788	93784	93784	I	0	" "
93808	93809	93806	93806	myself	0	" "
93816	93820	93813	93813	you	1454	" she asked , "
93825	93832	93813	93813	you	1454	" Again he had a pause . "
93847	93851	93853	93853	you	0	" he added , "
93857	93858	93853	93853	you	0	" "
93885	93890	93879	93879	himself	235	" she went on , "
93898	93899	93879	93879	himself	235	" "
93902	93906	93879	93879	himself	235	" Strether replied , "
93915	93916	93917	93917	He	235	" "
93922	93923	93917	93917	He	235	" "
93926	93952	93955	93955	he	235	" She considered , and , if the fact was disconcerting to her , effectually concealed it . The next minute indeed she had recovered . "
93965	93985	93961	93961	you	1454	" Her emphasis was wonderful , and though his eyes had been wandering he looked at her longer now . "
93992	93993	93989	93989	you	1454	" "
94002	94018	93999	93999	I	0	" Her triumph was gentle , and she really had tones to make justice weep . "
94028	94029	94019	94019	I	0	" "
94037	94061	94062	94062	You	1454	" she said , yet still with the same discretion in her pride . He took in this note but went straight on . "
94087	94088	94082	94082	you	1454	" "
94095	94099	94082	94082	you	1454	" she smiled . "
94134	94135	94136	94136	I	0	" "
94139	94150	94136	94136	I	0	" he mused , still with his eyes on her . "
94161	94170	94151	94151	I	0	" She raised and dropped her linked hands . "
94197	94204	94194	94194	you	1454	" she asked in another tone , "
94208	94218	94206	94206	yourself	1454	" But she gave him no time to reply . "
94241	94242	94229	94229	I	0	" "
94248	94252	94243	94243	I	0	" he said ; "
94260	94261	94254	94254	she	1460	" "
94265	94275	94254	94254	she	1460	" - Madame de Vionnet had a clear stare . "
94284	94285	94279	94282	an angel of light	1461	" "
94306	94310	94303	94303	I	0	" he explained , "
94324	94329	94313	94313	you	0	" His companion wondered . "
94336	94337	94313	94313	you	0	" "
94390	94406	94386	94386	you	0	" It was an appeal , of a sudden , and she took it in . "
94413	94414	94386	94386	you	0	" "
94422	94423	94418	94418	you	0	" "
94430	94434	94435	94435	I	0	" she smiled . "
94446	94682	94444	94444	you	0	" she added with peculiar gentleness as she turned away . The sound of it lingered with him , making him fairly feel as if he had been tripped up and had a fall . In the very act of arranging with her for his independence he had , under pressure from a particular perception , inconsistently , quite stupidly , committed himself , and , with her subtlety sensitive on the spot to an advantage , she had driven in by a single word a little golden nail , the sharp intention of which he signally felt . He had n't detached , he had more closely connected himself , and his eyes , as he considered with some intensity this circumstance , met another pair which had just come within their range and which struck him as reflecting his sense of what he had done . He recognised them at the same moment as those of little Bilham , who had apparently drawn near on purpose to speak to him , and little Bilham was n't , in the conditions , the person to whom his heart would be most closed . They were seated together a minute later at the angle of the room obliquely opposite the corner in which Gloriani was still engaged with Jeanne de Vionnet , to whom at first and in silence their attention had been benevolently given . "
94691	94697	94683	94683	I	0	" Strether had then observed , "
94739	94790	94732	94732	you	1465	" He remembered the tone into which he had been betrayed on the garden - bench at the sculptor 's reception , and this might make up for that by being much more the right sort of thing to say to a young man worthy of any advice at all . "
94797	94798	94732	94732	you	1465	" "
94804	94805	94732	94732	you	1465	" "
94812	94813	94732	94732	you	1465	" "
94825	94826	94821	94823	Mademoiselle de Vionnet	154	" "
94829	94833	94821	94823	Mademoiselle de Vionnet	154	" Strether asked , "
94854	94855	94843	94843	She	1407	" "
94920	94921	94948	94949	nous autres	1470	" "
94928	94933	94923	94923	you	1465	" Strether threw out . "
94972	95033	94965	94965	They	1467	" Strether , lounging on his divan and still charmed by the young girl , whose eyes had consciously strayed to him , he fancied , with a vague smile - Strether , enjoying the whole occasion as with dormant pulses at last awake and in spite of new material thrust upon him , thought over his companion 's words . "
95048	95049	95050	95050	She	1407	" "
95087	95094	95085	95085	Chad	111	" Strether was silent a little . "
95131	95132	95123	95123	He	111	" "
95165	95166	95153	95153	He	111	" "
95174	95185	95153	95153	He	111	" Strether presently remarked with a sighing sense of fulness . "
95212	95218	95207	95207	you	0	" little Bilham went on , "
95300	95301	95292	95292	I	0	" "
95306	95324	95304	95304	I	0	" Strether went on after a moment . But he had the next minute an inconsequent question . "
95334	95335	95327	95327	Chad	111	" "
95342	95388	95327	95327	Chad	111	" - and little Bilham fell back on his cushions . It reminded our friend of Miss Barrace , and he felt again the brush of his sense of moving in a maze of mystic closed allusions . Yet he kept hold of his thread . "
95422	95426	95404	95404	Chad	111	" he declared , "
95436	95440	95432	95432	You	1478	" he resumed , "
95488	95489	95480	95480	he	111	" "
95526	95527	95511	95511	They	1480	" "
95530	95534	95511	95511	They	1480	" said Strether , "
95551	95552	95545	95545	He	111	" "
95556	95561	95563	95563	you	0	" little Bilham enquired , "
95571	95572	95563	95563	you	0	" "
95588	95592	95593	95593	he	111	" Strether continued , "
95601	95608	95598	95598	he	111	" Little Bilham had a pause . "
95631	95632	95610	95610	he	111	" "
95639	95647	95610	95610	he	111	" his companion observed with some decision . "
95652	95661	95663	95663	I	0	" the young man dropped after a moment , "
95666	95675	95663	95663	I	0	" It kept Strether himself silent a little . "
95684	95690	95676	95676	I	0	" he then went on ; "
95739	95740	95732	95732	Chad	111	" "
95743	95748	95732	95732	Chad	111	" said little Bilham , "
95761	95762	95757	95757	you	1481	" "
95801	95808	95796	95796	you	1481	" The young man cast about . "
95814	95815	95812	95812	I	0	" "
95825	95826	95823	95823	you	1481	" "
95833	95888	95823	95823	you	1481	" little Bilham exclaimed . It might , on repetition , as a mystification , have irritated our friend a little , but he knew , once more , as we have seen , where he was , and his being proof against everything was only another attestation that he meant to stay there . "
95961	95974	95958	95958	you	1481	" Strether proceeded as if not for little Bilham 's benefit alone . "
96011	96012	95958	95958	you	1481	" "
96020	96025	95958	95958	you	1481	" said little Bilham . "
96068	96111	96056	96056	I	0	" Strether , from beside him and leaning back with him as he leaned , dropped on him a momentary look which filled a short interval and of which he took no notice . He only gazed before him with intent participation . "
96121	96129	96056	96056	I	0	" Strether at all events presently pursued , "
96173	96174	96170	96170	he	1488	" "
96179	96184	96176	96176	he	1488	" little Bilham echoed . "
96213	96217	96211	96211	you	1490	" he added ; "
96268	96269	96265	96265	you	1490	" "
96278	96284	96265	96265	you	1490	" Strether impatiently broke in : "
96306	96307	96299	96299	her	1489	" "
96345	96354	96342	96342	you	1490	" the young man in all fairness developed , "
96392	96397	96398	96398	he	1488	" he wound up , "
96403	96404	96398	96398	he	1488	" "
96407	96411	96398	96398	he	1488	" said Strether . "
96463	96470	96461	96461	he	1488	" Strether vaguely took it up . "
96476	96477	96478	96478	She	1489	" "
96548	96553	96543	96543	She	1489	" said little Bilham thoughtfully "
96556	96578	96543	96543	She	1489	" Strether 's theory that it was none of his business was somehow not damaged by the way he took this . "
96587	96606	96609	96609	he	1488	" On which his companion looked round at him , and now for an instant their eyes met . "
96611	96625	96609	96609	he	1488	" he repeated . Little Bilham , for as long , hung fire . "
96633	96637	96627	96627	you	0	" Strether thought . "
96643	96644	96627	96627	you	0	" "
96652	96653	96648	96648	you	0	" "
96659	96666	96648	96648	you	0	" - Strether took him up . "
96676	96685	96669	96669	I	0	" The young man at last looked away . "
96695	96696	96687	96687	she	1497	" "
96699	96711	96687	96687	she	1497	" Strether oddly exclaimed . But his companion immediately met it . "
96733	96734	96726	96726	you	0	" "
96745	96746	96737	96737	I	0	" "
96751	96760	96748	96748	I	0	" But it was all little Bilham said . "
96774	96778	96771	96771	I	0	" Strether explained , "
96788	96803	96809	96809	she	1497	" It appeared , however , to strike him as his business to add : "
96814	96820	96809	96809	she	1497	" Little Bilham just waited . "
96831	96839	96826	96826	you	0	" But Strether had his answer ready . "
96886	96887	96880	96880	him	1488	" "
96902	96903	96912	96912	she	1497	" "
96919	96920	96912	96912	she	1497	" "
96927	96934	96912	96912	she	1497	" the young man threw out , "
96943	96944	96912	96912	she	1497	" "
96953	96978	96912	96912	she	1497	" Strether could but laugh at that . It brought him back , however , to the point he had really wished to make . "
97062	97073	97046	97046	she	1497	" Little Bilham appeared to wonder what he had hinted . "
97081	97082	97087	97087	SHE	1497	" "
97200	97230	97231	97231	You	0	" And Strether , with his head back and his eyes on the ceiling , seemed to lose himself in the vision of it . His companion attended deeply . "
97240	97241	97231	97231	You	0	" "
97251	97256	97257	97257	I	0	" Little Bilham considered . "
97271	97272	97259	97259	you	0	" "
97307	97308	97298	97298	I	0	" "
97315	97316	97298	97298	I	0	" "
97351	97352	97364	97364	you	0	" "
97355	97363	97364	97364	you	0	" said little Bilham after a moment , "
97390	97391	97376	97376	He	1504	" "
97395	97399	97402	97402	you	0	" Strether asked , "
97411	97412	97418	97418	she	85	" "
97449	97455	97441	97442	A man	572	" little Bilham presently pursued , "
97486	97491	97484	97484	Chad	111	" he wound up , "
97499	97500	97484	97484	Chad	111	" "
97509	97510	97502	97502	you	0	" "
97540	97541	97532	97534	M. de Vionnet	168	" "
97549	97557	97532	97534	M. de Vionnet	168	" The young man waited a moment . "
97592	97615	97589	97590	a man	572	" he propounded . Strether 's answer was as prompt as if he had already , for himself , worked it out . "
97643	97647	97649	97649	his	1504	" he mused , "
97668	97669	97649	97649	his	1504	" "
97677	97686	97649	97649	his	1504	" his companion laughed . Then more bravely : "
97694	97701	97649	97649	his	1504	" But before Strether could reply , "
97714	97731	97709	97709	Chad	111	" he wound up . Strether , for a little , appeared to think of it . "
97743	97761	97737	97737	you	1515	" he then broke out . The next moment he was on his feet with a question . "
97768	97775	97762	97762	He	1504	" Little Bilham rose more slowly . "
97788	97803	97807	97807	HER	1517	" Strether 's eyes , as they stood together , turned again to Jeanne . "
97809	97818	97807	97807	HER	1517	" His friend made a sudden strange face . "
97829	97830	97807	97807	HER	1517	" "
97847	97856	97836	97836	your	1515	" His friend once more had a pause . "
97870	97871	97868	97868	Jeanne	150	" "
97877	97878	97868	97868	Jeanne	150	" "
97888	97889	97868	97868	Jeanne	150	" "
97906	97915	97902	97902	you	1515	" - little Bilham spoke in friendly reminder - "
97925	97926	97902	97902	you	1515	" "
97947	97964	97968	97968	her	150	" As if from the interest of his own question Strether had gone on without hearing . "
97985	98003	97968	97968	her	150	" He appeared to make a point of this , and little Bilham looked at him now . "
98021	98036	98015	98015	they	2824	" Then he threw off as with an extravagance of which he was conscious : "
98044	98052	98053	98053	You	1515	" Little Bilham looked at him indeed . "
98064	98065	98053	98053	You	1515	" "
98076	98077	98070	98070	he	572	" "
98080	98081	98070	98070	he	572	" "
98092	99578	98090	98090	himself	572	" But Strether spoke with a sound that might have passed for a laugh . Volume II Book Seventh I It was n't the first time Strether had sat alone in the great dim church - still less was it the first of his giving himself up , so far as conditions permitted , to its beneficent action on his nerves . He had been to Notre Dame with Waymarsh , he had been there with Miss Gostrey , he had been there with Chad Newsome , and had found the place , even in company , such a refuge from the obsession of his problem that , with renewed pressure from that source , he had not unnaturally recurred to a remedy meeting the case , for the moment , so indirectly , no doubt , but so relievingly . He was conscious enough that it was only for the moment , but good moments - if he could call them good - still had their value for a man who by this time struck himself as living almost disgracefully from hand to mouth . Having so well learnt the way , he had lately made the pilgrimage more than once by himself - had quite stolen off , taking an unnoticed chance and making no point of speaking of the adventure when restored to his friends . His great friend , for that matter , was still absent , as well as remarkably silent ; even at the end of three weeks Miss Gostrey had n't come back . She wrote to him from Mentone , admitting that he must judge her grossly inconsequent - perhaps in fact for the time odiously faithless ; but asking for patience , for a deferred sentence , throwing herself in short on his generosity . For her too , she could assure him , life was complicated - more complicated than he could have guessed ; she had moreover made certain of him - certain of not wholly missing him on her return - before her disappearance . If furthermore she did n't burden him with letters it was frankly because of her sense of the other great commerce he had to carry on . He himself , at the end of a fortnight , had written twice , to show how his generosity could be trusted ; but he reminded himself in each case of Mrs. Newsome 's epistolary manner at the times when Mrs. Newsome kept off delicate ground . He sank his problem , he talked of Waymarsh and Miss Barrace , of little Bilham and the set over the river , with whom he had again had tea , and he was easy , for convenience , about Chad and Madame de Vionnet and Jeanne . He admitted that he continued to see them , he was decidedly so confirmed a haunter of Chad 's premises and that young man 's practical intimacy with them was so undeniably great ; but he had his reason for not attempting to render for Miss Gostrey 's benefit the impression of these last days . That would be to tell her too much about himself - it being at present just from himself he was trying to escape . This small struggle sprang not a little , in its way , from the same impulse that had now carried him across to Notre Dame ; the impulse to let things be , to give them time to justify themselves or at least to pass . He was aware of having no errand in such a place but the desire not to be , for the hour , in certain other places ; a sense of safety , of simplification , which each time he yielded to it he amused himself by thinking of as a private concession to cowardice . The great church had no altar for his worship , no direct voice for his soul ; but it was none the less soothing even to sanctity ; for he could feel while there what he could n't elsewhere , that he was a plain tired man taking the holiday he had earned . He was tired , but he was n't plain - that was the pity and the trouble of it ; he was able , however , to drop his problem at the door very much as if it had been the copper piece that he deposited , on the threshold , in the receptacle of the inveterate blind beggar . He trod the long dim nave , sat in the splendid choir , paused before the cluttered chapels of the east end , and the mighty monument laid upon him its spell . He might have been a student under the charm of a museum - which was exactly what , in a foreign town , in the afternoon of life , he would have liked to be free to be . This form of sacrifice did at any rate for the occasion as well as another ; it made him quite sufficiently understand how , within the precinct , for the real refugee , the things of the world could fall into abeyance . That was the cowardice , probably - to dodge them , to beg the question , not to deal with it in the hard outer light ; but his own oblivions were too brief , too vain , to hurt any one but himself , and he had a vague and fanciful kindness for certain persons whom he met , figures of mystery and anxiety , and whom , with observation for his pastime , he ranked as those who were fleeing from justice . Justice was outside , in the hard light , and injustice too ; but one was as absent as the other from the air of the long aisles and the brightness of the many altars . Thus it was at all events that , one morning some dozen days after the dinner in the Boulevard Malesherbes at which Madame de Vionnet had been present with her daughter , he was called upon to play his part in an encounter that deeply stirred his imagination . He had the habit , in these contemplations , of watching a fellow visitant , here and there , from a respectable distance , remarking some note of behaviour , of penitence , of prostration , of the absolved , relieved state ; this was the manner in which his vague tenderness took its course , the degree of demonstration to which it naturally had to confine itself . It had n't indeed so felt its responsibility as when on this occasion he suddenly measured the suggestive effect of a lady whose supreme stillness , in the shade of one of the chapels , he had two or three times noticed as he made , and made once more , his slow circuit . She was n't prostrate - not in any degree bowed , but she was strangely fixed , and her prolonged immobility showed her , while he passed and paused , as wholly given up to the need , whatever it was , that had brought her there . She only sat and gazed before her , as he himself often sat ; but she had placed herself , as he never did , within the focus of the shrine , and she had lost herself , he could easily see , as he would only have liked to do . She was not a wandering alien , keeping back more than she gave , but one of the familiar , the intimate , the fortunate , for whom these dealings had a method and a meaning . She reminded our friend - since it was the way of nine tenths of his current impressions to act as recalls of things imagined - of some fine firm concentrated heroine of an old story , something he had heard , read , something that , had he had a hand for drama , he might himself have written , renewing her courage , renewing her clearness , in splendidly - protected meditation . Her back , as she sat , was turned to him , but his impression absolutely required that she should be young and interesting , and she carried her head moreover , even in the sacred shade , with a discernible faith in herself , a kind of implied conviction of consistency , security , impunity . But what had such a woman come for if she had n't come to pray ? Strether 's reading of such matters was , it must be owned , confused ; but he wondered if her attitude were some congruous fruit of absolution , of "
99581	100037	100038	100038	You	1526	" He knew but dimly what indulgence , in such a place , might mean ; yet he had , as with a soft sweep , a vision of how it might indeed add to the zest of active rites . All this was a good deal to have been denoted by a mere lurking figure who was nothing to him ; but , the last thing before leaving the church , he had the surprise of a still deeper quickening . He had dropped upon a seat halfway down the nave and , again in the museum mood , was trying with head thrown back and eyes aloft , to reconstitute a past , to reduce it in fact to the convenient terms of Victor Hugo , whom , a few days before , giving the rein for once in a way to the joy of life , he had purchased in seventy bound volumes , a miracle of cheapness , parted with , he was assured by the shopman , at the price of the red - and - gold alone . He looked , doubtless , while he played his eternal nippers over Gothic glooms , sufficiently rapt in reverence ; but what his thought had finally bumped against was the question of where , among packed accumulations , so multiform a wedge would be able to enter . Were seventy volumes in red - and - gold to be perhaps what he should most substantially have to show at Woollett as the fruit of his mission ? It was a possibility that held him a minute - held him till he happened to feel that some one , unnoticed , had approached him and paused . Turning , he saw that a lady stood there as for a greeting , and he sprang up as he next took her , securely , for Madame de Vionnet , who appeared to have recognised him as she passed near him on her way to the door . She checked , quickly and gaily , a certain confusion in him , came to meet it , turned it back , by an art of her own ; the confusion having threatened him as he knew her for the person he had lately been observing . She was the lurking figure of the dim chapel ; she had occupied him more than she guessed ; but it came to him in time , luckily , that he need n't tell her and that no harm , after all , had been done . She herself , for that matter , straightway showing she felt their encounter as the happiest of accidents , had for him a "
100043	100051	100038	100038	You	1526	" that despoiled surprise of every awkwardness . "
100056	100060	100052	100052	I	0	" she said . "
100116	100142	100110	100110	I	0	" Looking about for a chair , so that he instantly pulled one nearer , she sat down with him again to the sound of an "
100155	100724	100725	100725	We	1532	" He confessed the extent of his feeling , though she left the object vague ; and he was struck with the tact , the taste of her vagueness , which simply took for granted in him a sense of beautiful things . He was conscious of how much it was affected , this sense , by something subdued and discreet in the way she had arranged herself for her special object and her morning walk - he believed her to have come on foot ; the way her slightly thicker veil was drawn - a mere touch , but everything ; the composed gravity of her dress , in which , here and there , a dull wine - colour seemed to gleam faintly through black ; the charming discretion of her small compact head ; the quiet note , as she sat , of her folded , grey - gloved hands . It was , to Strether 's mind , as if she sat on her own ground , the light honours of which , at an open gate , she thus easily did him , while all the vastness and mystery of the domain stretched off behind . When people were so completely in possession they could be extraordinarily civil ; and our friend had indeed at this hour a kind of revelation of her heritage . She was romantic for him far beyond what she could have guessed , and again he found his small comfort in the conviction that , subtle though she was , his impression must remain a secret from her . The thing that , once more , made him uneasy for secrets in general was this particular patience she could have with his own want of colour ; albeit that on the other hand his uneasiness pretty well dropped after he had been for ten minutes as colourless as possible and at the same time as responsive . The moments had already , for that matter , drawn their deepest tinge from the special interest excited in him by his vision of his companion 's identity with the person whose attitude before the glimmering altar had so impressed him . This attitude fitted admirably into the stand he had privately taken about her connexion with Chad on the last occasion of his seeing them together . It helped him to stick fast at the point he had then reached ; it was there he had resolved that he WOULD stick , and at no moment since had it seemed as easy to do so . Unassailably innocent was a relation that could make one of the parties to it so carry herself . If it was n't innocent why did she haunt the churches ? - into which , given the woman he could believe he made out , she would never have come to flaunt an insolence of guilt . She haunted them for continued help , for strength , for peace - sublime support which , if one were able to look at it so , she found from day to day . They talked , in low easy tones and with lifted lingering looks , about the great monument and its history and its beauty - all of which , Madame de Vionnet professed , came to her most in the other , the outer view . "
100733	100737	100743	100743	you	1534	" she said , "
100767	100816	100746	100746	I	0	" He had spoken of the great romancer and the great romance , and of what , to his imagination , they had done for the whole , mentioning to her moreover the exorbitance of his purchase , the seventy blazing volumes that were so out of proportion . "
100823	100824	100746	100746	I	0	" "
100832	101334	100746	100746	I	0	" Yet he felt even as he spoke how at that instant he was plunging . He had made up his mind and was impatient to get into the air ; for his purpose was a purpose to be uttered outside , and he had a fear that it might with delay still slip away from him . She however took her time ; she drew out their quiet gossip as if she had wished to profit by their meeting , and this confirmed precisely an interpretation of her manner , of her mystery . While she rose , as he would have called it , to the question of Victor Hugo , her voice itself , the light low quaver of her deference to the solemnity about them , seemed to make her words mean something that they did n't mean openly . Help , strength , peace , a sublime support - she had n't found so much of these things as that the amount would n't be sensibly greater for any scrap his appearance of faith in her might enable her to feel in her hand . Every little , in a long strain , helped , and if he happened to affect her as a firm object she could hold on by , he would n't jerk himself out of her reach . People in difficulties held on by what was nearest , and he was perhaps after all not further off than sources of comfort more abstract . It was as to this he had made up his mind ; he had made it up , that is , to give her a sign . The sign would be that - though it was her own affair - he understood ; the sign would be that - though it was her own affair - she was free to clutch . Since she took him for a firm object - much as he might to his own sense appear at times to rock - he would do his best to BE one . The end of it was that half an hour later they were seated together for an early luncheon at a wonderful , a delightful house of entertainment on the left bank - a place of pilgrimage for the knowing , they were both aware , the knowing who came , for its great renown , the homage of restless days , from the other end of the town . Strether had already been there three times - first with Miss Gostrey , then with Chad , then with Chad again and with Waymarsh and little Bilham , all of whom he had himself sagaciously entertained ; and his pleasure was deep now on learning that Madame de Vionnet had n't yet been initiated . When he had said as they strolled round the church , by the river , acting at last on what , within , he had made up his mind to , "
101371	101525	101354	101354	you	1535	" - and then had named the place ; when he had done this she stopped short as for quick intensity , and yet deep difficulty , of response . She took in the proposal as if it were almost too charming to be true ; and there had perhaps never yet been for her companion so unexpected a moment of pride - so fine , so odd a case , at any rate , as his finding himself thus able to offer to a person in such universal possession a new , a rare amusement . She had heard of the happy spot , but she asked him in reply to a further question how in the world he could suppose her to have been there . He supposed himself to have supposed that Chad might have taken her , and she guessed this the next moment to his no small discomfort . "
101532	101536	101354	101354	you	1535	" she smiled , "
101581	102144	101578	101578	I	0	" It was more than kind of him to have thought of it - though , frankly , if he asked whether she had time she had n't a single minute . That however made no difference - she 'd throw everything over . Every duty at home , domestic , maternal , social , awaited her ; but it was a case for a high line . Her affairs would go to smash , but had n't one a right to one 's snatch of scandal when one was prepared to pay ? It was on this pleasant basis of costly disorder , consequently , that they eventually seated themselves , on either side of a small table , at a window adjusted to the busy quay and the shining barge - burdened Seine ; where , for an hour , in the matter of letting himself go , of diving deep , Strether was to feel he had touched bottom . He was to feel many things on this occasion , and one of the first of them was that he had travelled far since that evening in London , before the theatre , when his dinner with Maria Gostrey , between the pink - shaded candles , had struck him as requiring so many explanations . He had at that time gathered them in , the explanations - he had stored them up ; but it was at present as if he had either soared above or sunk below them - he could n't tell which ; he could somehow think of none that did n't seem to leave the appearance of collapse and cynicism easier for him than lucidity . How could he wish it to be lucid for others , for any one , that he , for the hour , saw reasons enough in the mere way the bright clean ordered water - side life came in at the open window ? - the mere way Madame de Vionnet , opposite him over their intensely white table - linen , their omelette aux tomates , their bottle of straw - coloured Chablis , thanked him for everything almost with the smile of a child , while her grey eyes moved in and out of their talk , back to the quarter of the warm spring air , in which early summer had already begun to throb , and then back again to his face and their human questions . Their human questions became many before they had done - many more , as one after the other came up , than our friend 's free fancy had at all foreseen . The sense he had had before , the sense he had had repeatedly , the sense that the situation was running away with him , had never been so sharp as now ; and all the more that he could perfectly put his finger on the moment it had taken the bit in its teeth . That accident had definitely occurred , the other evening , after Chad 's dinner ; it had occurred , as he fully knew , at the moment when he interposed between this lady and her child , when he suffered himself so to discuss with her a matter closely concerning them that her own subtlety , marked by its significant "
102148	102440	102146	102146	you	1539	" instantly sealed the occasion in her favour . Again he had held off for ten days , but the situation had continued out of hand in spite of that ; the fact that it was running so fast being indeed just WHY he had held off . What had come over him as he recognised her in the nave of the church was that holding off could be but a losing game from the instant she was worked for not only by her subtlety , but by the hand of fate itself . If all the accidents were to fight on her side - and by the actual showing they loomed large - he could only give himself up . This was what he had done in privately deciding then and there to propose she should breakfast with him . What did the success of his proposal in fact resemble but the smash in which a regular runaway properly ends ? The smash was their walk , their dejeuner , their omelette , the Chablis , the place , the view , their present talk and his present pleasure in it - to say nothing , wonder of wonders , of her own . To this tune and nothing less , accordingly , was his surrender made good . It sufficiently lighted up at least the folly of holding off . Ancient proverbs sounded , for his memory , in the tone of their words and the clink of their glasses , in the hum of the town and the plash of the river . It WAS clearly better to suffer as a sheep than as a lamb . One might as well perish by the sword as by famine . "
102446	102515	102146	102146	you	1539	" - that was the first thing she had asked him ; and when he had found the frankness to be cheerful about it in spite of the meaning he knew her to attach to Miss Gostrey 's absence , she had gone on to enquire if he did n't tremendously miss her . There were reasons that made him by no means sure , yet he nevertheless answered "
102517	102536	102146	102146	you	1539	" ; which she took in as if it were all she had wished to prove . Then , "
102549	102553	102546	102547	a woman	3063	" she said ; "
102567	102568	102562	102562	she	3063	" "
102579	102580	102571	102571	you	97	" "
102591	102614	102587	102587	you	97	" She spoke ever so gently and as if with all fear of wounding him while she sat partaking of his bounty . "
102620	102714	102587	102587	you	97	" He felt himself colour at the question , and then hated that - hated to pass for anything so idiotic as woundable . Woundable by Chad 's lady , in respect to whom he had come out with such a fund of indifference - was he already at that point ? Perversely , none the less , his pause gave a strange air of truth to her supposition ; and what was he in fact but disconcerted at having struck her just in the way he had most dreamed of not doing ? "
102722	102728	102715	102715	I	0	" he at last smiled . "
102736	102737	102729	102729	I	0	" "
102751	102790	102747	102747	you	97	" She was a woman who , between courses , could be graceful with her elbows on the table . It was a posture unknown to Mrs. Newsome , but it was easy for a femme du monde . "
102799	102800	102793	102793	I	0	" "
102810	102815	102793	102793	I	0	" he presently returned , "
102851	102858	102864	102864	you	97	" She was instantly all there . "
102926	102927	102899	102899	you	97	" "
102935	102939	102930	102930	I	0	" said Strether . "
102956	102957	102946	102946	you	97	" "
102960	102976	102946	102946	you	97	" she murmured - she was full of attenuation . But she had another thought . "
102992	102993	102984	102984	you	0	" "
102999	103003	102996	102996	I	0	" he replied , "

103033	103042	103025	103025	you	0	" And he leaned back in his chair . "
103050	103057	103045	103045	your	0	" she laughed across at him . "
103108	103109	103097	103097	I	0	" "

103171	103177	103164	103164	I	0	" She was all eagerness . "

103227	103232	103223	103223	I	0	" he went on , "

103299	103307	103314	103314	your	0	" Patient and beautiful was her interest . "
103319	103338	103314	103314	your	0	" And she waited as if not to hustle him . He acknowledged it by immediately going on . "
103370	103371	103372	103372	I	0	" "
103378	103384	103375	103375	I	0	" Her eagerness broke through . "
103392	103407	103387	103387	I	0	" He could n't tell her that , however , and she quickly pursued . "
103418	103439	103440	103440	I	0	" His only answer at first was to help her to the dish that had been freshly put before them . "
103469	103470	103461	103461	I	0	" "
103483	103488	103481	103481	me	0	" she went on - "

103504	103505	103498	103498	you	0	" "
103518	103540	103508	103508	you	0	" She laughed again , while she took up her knife and fork , as in the cheer of these assurances . "
103552	103553	103547	103547	she	88	" "
103564	103565	103566	103566	Voila	170	" "
103568	103575	103566	103566	Voila	170	" And she waited a moment . "

103589	103598	103578	103578	you	0	" said Strether with a slightly strained smile , "
103615	103623	103608	103608	she	88	" Madame de Vionnet seemed to demur . "
103634	103641	103632	103632	her	88	" But Strether neglected the question . "
103649	103650	103644	103644	Chad	111	" "

103732	103736	103714	103714	her	88	" she continued , "
103780	103790	103769	103770	No woman	1087	" This was a proposition Strether could n't contradict . "

103862	103876	103856	103856	she	88	" It seemed to strike her as a happy , a beneficent thought . "
103908	103913	103903	103903	you	0	" she faintly quavered . "
103916	103922	103903	103903	you	0	" - he was prompt . "
103958	103965	103952	103952	I	0	" It instantly made her graver . "

103992	103998	103968	103968	you	0	" she exclaimed on this . "

104044	104051	104026	104026	You	0	" Strether returned after a moment , "

104071	104084	104068	104068	I	0	" His silence seemed again for a little to denote an understanding . "

104147	104154	104155	104155	I	0	" Strether good - humouredly pleaded . "
104193	104198	104189	104189	My	0	" he lucidly pursued , "
104336	104347	104331	104331	he	111	" She shook her head with a finer deeper wisdom . "
104373	104377	104359	104359	you	0	" Strether considered . "
104396	104412	104388	104388	You	88	" he added . It produced between them a long look from which neither shrank . "

104440	104445	104433	104433	She	88	" Strether presently stated . "

104478	104483	104462	104462	her	88	" our friend replied , "
104527	104536	104511	104511	him	111	" She measured the depth of this suggestion . "
104562	104587	104589	104589	she	88	" It made her companion , this enquiry , look again a while out at the view ; after which he spoke without sharpness . "
104597	104605	104589	104589	she	88	" But she had already broken in . "
104625	104650	104609	104609	she	88	" Strether 's attitude , that of due deference to what she said , permitted him to attend for a minute to his luncheon . "
104668	104669	104609	104609	she	88	" "
104701	104702	104609	104609	she	88	" "

104720	104728	104609	104609	she	88	" She gave a strange light laugh . "
104737	104753	104609	104609	she	88	" But her friend looked at her as if he had thought of that too . "
104772	104785	104767	104767	you	0	" She was leaning back now , but she fully faced him . "

104945	104950	104935	104935	You	0	" she wound up , "
104961	105048	104952	104952	you	0	" Strange and beautiful to him was her quiet soft acuteness . The thing that most moved him was really that she was so deeply serious . She had none of the portentous forms of it , but he had never come in contact , it struck him , with a force brought to so fine a head . Mrs. Newsome , goodness knew , was serious ; but it was nothing to this . He took it all in , he saw it all together . "
105051	105055	104952	104952	you	0	" he mused , "
105065	105076	105056	105056	I	0	" Her face affected him as with an exquisite light . "
105081	105082	105083	105083	I	0	" "
105086	105103	105083	105083	I	0	" At this she pushed back her chair and was the next moment on her feet . "
105107	105877	105105	105105	you	0	" she said with her hand held out to him across the table and with no less a meaning in the words than her lips had so particularly given them after Chad 's dinner . The golden nail she had then driven in pierced a good inch deeper . Yet he reflected that he himself had only meanwhile done what he had made up his mind to on the same occasion . So far as the essence of the matter went he had simply stood fast on the spot on which he had then planted his feet . II He received three days after this a communication from America , in the form of a scrap of blue paper folded and gummed , not reaching him through his bankers , but delivered at his hotel by a small boy in uniform , who , under instructions from the concierge , approached him as he slowly paced the little court . It was the evening hour , but daylight was long now and Paris more than ever penetrating . The scent of flowers was in the streets , he had the whiff of violets perpetually in his nose ; and he had attached himself to sounds and suggestions , vibrations of the air , human and dramatic , he imagined , as they were not in other places , that came out for him more and more as the mild afternoons deepened - a far - off hum , a sharp near click on the asphalt , a voice calling , replying , somewhere and as full of tone as an actor 's in a play . He was to dine at home , as usual , with Waymarsh - they had settled to that for thrift and simplicity ; and he now hung about before his friend came down . He read his telegram in the court , standing still a long time where he had opened it and giving five minutes afterwards to the renewed study of it . At last , quickly , he crumpled it up as if to get it out of the way ; in spite of which , however , he kept it there - still kept it when , at the end of another turn , he had dropped into a chair placed near a small table . Here , with his scrap of paper compressed in his fist and further concealed by his folding his arms tight , he sat for some time in thought , gazed before him so straight that Waymarsh appeared and approached him without catching his eye . The latter in fact , struck with his appearance , looked at him hard for a single instant and then , as if determined to that course by some special vividness in it , dropped back into the salon de lecture without addressing him . But the pilgrim from Milrose permitted himself still to observe the scene from behind the clear glass plate of that retreat . Strether ended , as he sat , by a fresh scrutiny of his compressed missive , which he smoothed out carefully again as he placed it on his table . There it remained for some minutes , until , at last looking up , he saw Waymarsh watching him from within . It was on this that their eyes met - met for a moment during which neither moved . But Strether then got up , folding his telegram more carefully and putting it into his waistcoat pocket . A few minutes later the friends were seated together at dinner ; but Strether had meanwhile said nothing about it , and they eventually parted , after coffee in the court , with nothing said on either side . Our friend had moreover the consciousness that even less than usual was on this occasion said between them , so that it was almost as if each had been waiting for something from the other . Waymarsh had always more or less the air of sitting at the door of his tent , and silence , after so many weeks , had come to play its part in their concert . This note indeed , to Strether 's sense , had lately taken a fuller tone , and it was his fancy to - night that they had never quite so drawn it out . Yet it befell , none the less that he closed the door to confidence when his companion finally asked him if there were anything particular the matter with him . "
105880	105884	105105	105105	you	0	" he replied , "
105889	106252	105105	105105	you	0	" On the morrow , however , at an early hour , he found occasion to give an answer more in consonance with the facts . What was the matter had continued to be so all the previous evening , the first hours of which , after dinner , in his room , he had devoted to the copious composition of a letter . He had quitted Waymarsh for this purpose , leaving him to his own resources with less ceremony than their wo nt , but finally coming down again with his letter unconcluded and going forth into the streets without enquiry for his comrade . He had taken a long vague walk , and one o'clock had struck before his return and his re - ascent to his room by the aid of the glimmering candle - end left for him on the shelf outside the porter 's lodge . He had possessed himself , on closing his door , of the numerous loose sheets of his unfinished composition , and then , without reading them over , had torn them into small pieces . He had thereupon slept - as if it had been in some measure thanks to that sacrifice - the sleep of the just , and had prolonged his rest considerably beyond his custom . Thus it was that when , between nine and ten , the tap of the knob of a walking - stick sounded on his door , he had not yet made himself altogether presentable . Chad Newsome 's bright deep voice determined quickly enough none the less the admission of the visitor . The little blue paper of the evening before , plainly an object the more precious for its escape from premature destruction , now lay on the sill of the open window , smoothed out afresh and kept from blowing away by the superincumbent weight of his watch . Chad , looking about with careless and competent criticism , as he looked wherever he went immediately espied it and permitted himself to fix it for a moment rather hard . After which he turned his eyes to his host . "
106260	106271	105105	105105	you	0	" Strether paused in the act of pinning his necktie . "
106283	106284	106277	106277	You	1560	" "
106310	106314	106305	106305	I	0	" he added , "
106349	106350	106371	106371	I	0	" "
106355	106364	106371	106371	I	0	" Strether had turned again to his glass . "
106435	106721	106422	106422	You	1561	" Strether , at his glass , finished dressing ; consulting that witness moreover on this last opinion . WAS he looking preternaturally fit ? There was something in it perhaps for Chad 's wonderful eye , but he had felt himself for hours rather in pieces . Such a judgement , however , was after all but a contribution to his resolve ; it testified unwittingly to his wisdom . He was still firmer , apparently - since it shone in him as a light - than he had flattered himself . His firmness indeed was slightly compromised , as he faced about to his friend , by the way this very personage looked - though the case would of course have been worse had n't the secret of personal magnificence been at every hour Chad 's unfailing possession . There he was in all the pleasant morning freshness of it - strong and sleek and gay , easy and fragrant and fathomless , with happy health in his colour , and pleasant silver in his thick young hair , and the right word for everything on the lips that his clear brownness caused to show as red . He had never struck Strether as personally such a success ; it was as if now , for his definite surrender , he had gathered himself vividly together . This , sharply and rather strangely , was the form in which he was to be presented to Woollett . Our friend took him in again - he was always taking him in and yet finding that parts of him still remained out ; though even thus his image showed through a mist of other things . "
106728	106732	106722	106722	I	0	" Strether said , "
106737	106738	106739	106739	I	0	" "
106753	106757	106747	106747	I	0	" Strether hesitated . "
106774	106775	106765	106765	I	0	" "
106778	106782	106765	106765	I	0	" said Chad , "
106804	106872	106875	106875	you	1562	" Strether had now got together hat , gloves and stick , but Chad had dropped on the sofa as if to show where he wished to make his point . He kept observing his companion 's things ; he might have been judging how quickly they could be packed . He might even have wished to hint that he 'd send his own servant to assist . "
106878	106882	106875	106875	you	1562	" Strether enquired , "
106889	106890	106875	106875	you	1562	" "
106915	106956	106875	106875	you	1562	" Strether had in his hand his telegram , which he had kept there after attaching his watch , and he now offered it to Chad , who , however , with an odd movement , declined to take it . "
106986	107022	106973	106973	I	0	" Strether , at this , while their eyes met , slowly folded the missive and put it in his pocket ; after which , before he had spoken again , Chad broke fresh ground . "
107029	107041	107024	107025	Miss Gostrey	99	" But when Strether presently spoke it was n't in answer . "
107109	107110	107106	107106	her	1043	" "
107117	107122	107115	107115	YOU	0	" Chad generously protested . "
107132	107154	107159	107159	me	0	" Strether was mild and melancholy , but firm . He saw it far away and over his companion 's head . "
107161	107162	107159	107159	me	0	" "
107174	107209	107170	107170	Marchons	171	" said the young man gaily . His host , however , at this , but continued to stand agaze ; and he had the next thing repeated his question of a moment before . "
107216	107217	107211	107212	Miss Gostrey	99	" "
107224	107225	107211	107212	Miss Gostrey	99	" "
107232	107233	107227	107227	you	1562	" "
107245	107256	107257	107257	Your	0	" But Strether would n't linger now on Miss Gostrey . "
107285	107286	107283	107283	myself	0	" "
107295	107310	107289	107289	you	1562	" Chad , from his sofa , reassuringly replied . Strether had a pause . "
107346	107347	107330	107330	you	0	" "
107352	107366	107330	107330	you	0	" Chad considered , but he had it at his fingers ' ends . "
107399	107406	107407	107407	I	0	" he happily and comfortably explained , "
107432	107433	107443	107443	she	85	" "
107436	107440	107443	107443	she	85	" said Strether , "
107495	107496	107487	107487	you	0	" "
107502	107506	107507	107507	I	0	" Chad exclaimed , "
107519	107520	107515	107515	you	0	" "
107537	107546	107525	107525	you	0	" Chad stared , then gave a laugh . "
107562	107571	107550	107550	my	0	" Strether debated ; he took another turn . "
107594	107595	107580	107580	I	0	" "
107605	107606	107598	107598	you	0	" "
107626	107631	107622	107622	your	0	" Strether went on , "
107656	107669	107647	107647	you	0	" But he paused , pulling up . At this Chad rose . "
107712	107724	107707	107707	her	1572	" He had met again his companion 's sufficiently searching look . "
107731	107758	107726	107726	you	0	" Chad gave him in reply to this , with a movement of the head , the strangest slow smile he had ever had from him . "
107761	107790	107726	107726	you	0	" It had immediately , on Strether 's imagination , so deep and soft an effect that our friend could only for the moment keep it before him . "
107793	107794	107726	107726	you	0	" "
107797	107813	107726	107726	you	0	" Chad obligingly and serenely repeated . It made his companion take several more steps . "
107819	107820	107815	107815	YOU'RE	0	" "
107825	107831	107815	107815	YOU'RE	0	" Strether pulled up again . "
107836	107844	107815	107815	YOU'RE	0	" The young man looked brightly amazed . "
107854	107855	107845	107845	You	0	" "
107875	107879	107872	107872	I	0	" said Strether , "
107886	107899	107900	107900	She	1043	" Chad showed a still livelier , but not an alarmed interest . "
107908	107919	107900	107900	She	1043	" Strether joined him for an instant in the vision . "
107936	107946	107947	107947	Mamie	97	" This also Chad saw - he laughed out . "
107953	107954	107947	107947	Mamie	97	" "
107957	107967	107947	107947	Mamie	97	" said Strether , ' she 's very charming . "
107968	107986	108000	108000	he	1574	" So you 've already more than once told me . I should like to see her . "
108022	108034	108035	108035	Strether	82	" See her then by all means . And consider too , "
108039	108097	108035	108035	Strether	82	" that you really give your sister a lift in letting her come to you . You give her a couple of months of Paris , which she has n't seen , if I 'm not mistaken , since just after she was married , and which I 'm sure she wants but the pretext to visit . "
108111	108131	108035	108035	Strether	82	" She has had it , the pretext , these several years , yet she has never taken it . "
108132	108138	108139	108139	Strether	82	" Do you mean YOU ? "
108145	108158	108160	108160	Chad	111	" Certainly - the lone exile . And whom do you mean ? "
108162	108190	108160	108160	Chad	111	" Oh I mean ME . I 'm her pretext . That is - for it comes to the same thing - I 'm your mother 's . "
108191	108195	108196	108196	Chad	111	" Then why , "
108199	108206	108196	108196	Chad	111	" does n't Mother come herself ? "
108215	108222	108225	108225	he	111	" Should you like her to ? "
108232	108244	108225	108225	he	111	" It 's perfectly open to you to cable for her . "
108250	108258	108245	108245	Chad	111	" Will she come if I do ? "
108259	108271	108313	108313	his	82	" Quite possibly . But try , and you 'll see . "
108272	108279	108280	108280	Chad	111	" Why do n't YOU try ? "
108286	108294	108295	108295	Chad	111	" Because I do n't want to . "
108298	108306	108295	108295	Chad	111	" Do n't desire her presence here ? "
108320	108334	108313	108313	his	82	" Do n't put it off , my dear boy , on ME ! "
108335	108369	108295	108295	Chad	111	" Well - I see what you mean . I 'm sure you 'd behave beautifully but you DON'T want to see her . So I wo n't play you that trick . ' "
108372	108376	108295	108295	Chad	111	" Strether declared , "
108400	108409	108398	108398	you	1579	" Then he added in a different tone : "
108431	108471	108419	108421	Madame de Vionnet	85	" Their eyes , on this proposition , continued to meet , but Chad 's pleasant and bold , never flinched for a moment . He got up at last and he said something with which Strether was struck . "
108509	108524	108525	108525	She	85	" Strether thought a moment , affected by this , but finally turning away . "
108529	108530	108525	108525	She	85	" "
108536	108540	108525	108525	She	85	" Chad asked . "
108549	108577	108525	108525	She	85	" Strether , who uttered this with serenity , had urged a plea for their now getting into the air ; but the young man still waited . "
108584	108585	108579	108579	you	1579	" "
108594	108595	108588	108588	I	0	" "
108603	108604	108597	108597	you	1579	" "
108610	108611	108597	108597	you	1579	" "
108614	108628	108588	108588	I	0	" - and Chad , with this , had a smile for him - "
108634	108635	108640	108641	Miss Gostrey	99	" "
108706	108711	108716	108716	you	1579	" Strether went on , "
108745	108750	108732	108732	you	1579	" Chad looked grave . "
108755	108756	108732	108732	you	1579	" "
108792	108796	108788	108789	the Pococks	135	" Strether repeated . "
108803	108804	108788	108789	the Pococks	135	" "
108812	108826	108827	108827	You	1579	" Chad , as if it still puzzled him , waited a minute . "
108837	108838	108827	108827	You	1579	" "
108848	108849	108850	108850	You	1579	" "
108853	108863	108850	108850	You	1579	" Chad asked in a tone of his own , "
108871	108872	108850	108850	You	1579	" "
108875	108880	108850	108850	You	1579	" Strether faced it . "
108897	108898	108881	108881	You	1579	" "
108919	108927	108881	108881	You	1579	" Chad went on with conscious queerness , "
108936	108973	108881	108881	You	1579	" The change of position and of relation , for each , was so oddly betrayed in the question that Chad laughed out as soon as he had uttered it - which made Strether also laugh . "
108996	109004	108881	108881	You	1579	" he could n't help breaking out , "
109021	109022	109011	109011	you	1579	" "
109025	109039	109011	109011	you	1579	" said Chad , while he broke down as for weight of thought . "
109051	109052	109011	109011	you	1579	" "
109063	109064	109055	109055	you	1579	" "
109086	109090	109081	109081	you	1579	" Strether continued , "
109102	109137	109081	109081	you	1579	" Chad looked amused and interested , yet still somewhat in the dark ; partly perhaps because Strether 's estimate of fun had required of him from the first a good deal of elucidation . "
109148	109149	109143	109143	I	0	" "
109153	109159	109143	109143	I	0	" - Strether remained blank . "
109177	109181	109173	109175	Madame de Vionnet	85	" Chad smiled , "
109190	109191	109173	109175	Madame de Vionnet	85	" "
109202	109219	109198	109198	I	0	" Again for an instant their eyes had the question out ; after which Strether said : "
109222	109223	109198	109198	I	0	" "
109231	109236	109225	109225	I	0	" Chad presently returned . "
109248	109249	109246	109246	Mother	141	" "
109281	109282	109269	109269	you	1579	" "
109286	109291	109269	109269	you	1579	" said Chad wonderfully , "
109297	109313	109292	109292	I	0	" There was an easy triumph in it that made his friend laugh out again . "
109352	109356	109358	109358	you	1579	" Strether asked , "
109364	109365	109358	109358	you	1579	" "
109369	109382	109358	109358	you	1579	" - Chad seemed to find it in fact difficult to say . "
109386	109387	109392	109392	you	1579	" "
109411	109416	109406	109406	you	1579	" Chad went on , "
109429	109435	109406	109406	you	1579	" Strether thought a minute . "
109489	109490	109491	109491	I	0	" "
109499	109503	109491	109491	I	0	" said Chad , "
109510	109511	109512	109512	I	0	" "
109527	109528	109522	109522	I	0	" "
109535	109539	109531	109531	you	1579	" Chad asked , "
109544	109545	109531	109531	you	1579	" "
109567	109571	109575	109575	yourself	1579	" Strether explained , "
109577	109583	109575	109575	yourself	1579	" Chad took it in . "
109596	109597	109588	109588	I	0	" "
109601	109609	109588	109588	I	0	" Strether echoed as inexpressively as possible . "
109645	109665	109641	109641	you	1579	" Strether decided after a moment that he did know what , and in consonance with this he spoke . "
109677	109678	109673	109673	you	1579	" "
109691	109692	109706	109706	I	0	" "

109710	109885	109706	109706	I	0	" But Chad , as they went downstairs , clapped a firm hand , in the manner of a pledge , upon his shoulder . They descended slowly together and had , in the court of the hotel , some further talk , of which the upshot was that they presently separated . Chad Newsome departed , and Strether , left alone , looked about , superficially , for Waymarsh . But Waymarsh had n't yet , it appeared , come down , and our friend finally went forth without sight of him . III At four o'clock that afternoon he had still not seen him , but he was then , as to make up for this , engaged in talk about him with Miss Gostrey . Strether had kept away from home all day , given himself up to the town and to his thoughts , wandered and mused , been at once restless and absorbed - and all with the present climax of a rich little welcome in the Quartier Marboeuf . "
109899	109907	109706	109706	I	0	" - for Miss Gostrey had enquired - "
109929	109930	109932	109932	you	0	" "

109968	110009	109949	109949	I	0	" Strether 's hostess , it might have been made out , just escaped changing colour . Reflexion arrived but in time and established a provisional serenity . It was perhaps exactly this that enabled her to say with duplicity : "
110016	110017	110011	110011	you	0	" "
110028	110042	110018	110018	You	0	" She shook her head as if this were not worth taking up . "
110081	110085	110088	110088	me	0	" she smiled , "
110101	110102	110095	110095	You	0	" "
110111	110116	110105	110105	I	0	" he comfortably declared , "
110124	110132	110118	110118	I	0	" She took him all in again . "
110163	110169	110172	110172	I	0	" He intelligently accepted it . "
110238	110239	110224	110224	he	96	" "
110243	110247	110224	110224	he	96	" she murmured . "

110318	110322	110306	110306	I	0	" She wondered . "
110335	110344	110329	110329	You	0	" He settled his glasses on his nose . "
110353	110354	110346	110346	I	0	" "

110386	110392	110376	110376	He	96	" She made it out . "

110407	110412	110413	110413	Waymarsh	96	" he almost groaned . "
110518	110525	110528	110528	you	96	" She was silent a little . "
110538	110561	110533	110533	you	96	" He had a pause that matched her own ; then he had , with an adequate spirit , a complete admission . "
110597	110598	110593	110593	I	0	" "
110603	110640	110601	110601	me	0	" she earnestly pressed . As he , however , for the time answered nothing , only returning the look with which she watched him , she presented herself where it was easier to meet her . "
110649	110650	110643	110644	Mr. Waymarsh	96	" "
110673	110674	110664	110664	He	96	" "
110679	110686	110677	110677	you	0	" - she was all interest . "

110798	110805	110782	110782	he	111	" Miss Gostrey followed with intensity . "
110812	110821	110822	110822	I	0	" Strether settled himself afresh in his chair . "
110834	110844	110807	110807	you	0	" - he gave it to her more vividly - "
110850	110851	110852	110852	I	0	" "
110868	110872	110855	110855	I	0	" she asked , "

110925	110938	110906	110906	I	0	" It was an account of the matter Miss Gostrey could weigh . "

110950	110954	110940	110940	he	111	" said Strether , "

111041	111045	111031	111031	his	111	" Strether replied ; "
111105	111112	111100	111100	he	111	" Miss Gostrey turned it over . "
111120	111121	111113	111113	He	111	" "
111148	111152	111153	111153	he	111	" Strether pursued , "
111170	111171	111153	111153	he	111	" "
111177	111192	111173	111173	you	0	" his companion suggested , ' stay here always . I wish you could . "
111193	111236	111243	111243	his	111	" By no means . Still , I want to see him a little further . He 's not in the least the case I supposed , he 's quite another case . And it 's as such that he interests me . "
111259	111269	111279	111279	She	99	" I do n't want to give him up . "
111288	111300	111279	111279	She	99	" Up , you mean - a - to his mother ? "
111301	111411	111412	111413	Miss Gostrey	99	" Well , I 'm not thinking of his mother now . I 'm thinking of the plan of which I was the mouthpiece , which , as soon as we met , I put before him as persuasively as I knew how , and which was drawn up , as it were , in complete ignorance of all that , in this last long period , has been happening to him . It took no account whatever of the impression I was here on the spot immediately to begin to receive from him - impressions of which I feel sure I 'm far from having had the last . "
111423	111439	111412	111413	Miss Gostrey	99	" So your idea is - more or less - to stay out of curiosity ? "
111440	111456	111279	111279	She	99	" Call it what you like ! I do n't care what it 's called - "
111457	111480	111481	111482	Maria Gostrey	97	" So long as you do stay ? Certainly not then . I call it , all the same , immense fun , "
111485	111511	111512	111512	He	1600	" and to see you work it out will be one of the sensations of my life . It IS clear you can toddle alone ! "
111519	111531	111532	111532	Her	99	" I sha n't be alone when the Pococks have come . "
111537	111543	111532	111532	Her	99	" The Pococks are coming ? "
111544	111591	111592	111593	Miss Gostrey	99	" That , I mean , is what will happen - and happen as quickly as possible - in consequence of Chad 's cable . They 'll simply embark . Sarah will come to speak for her mother - with an effect different from MY muddle . "
111598	111606	111592	111593	Miss Gostrey	99	" SHE then will take him back ? "
111607	111636	111532	111532	Her	99	" Very possibly - and we shall see . She must at any rate have the chance , and she may be trusted to do all she can . "
111637	111644	111532	111532	Her	99	" And do you WANT that ? "
111645	111649	111651	111651	Strether	82	" Of course , "
111653	111664	111651	111651	Strether	82	" I want it . I want to play fair . "
111675	111687	111666	111666	she	99	" If it devolves on the Pococks why do you stay ? "
111688	111710	111711	111711	Strether	82	" Just to see that I DO play fair - and a little also , no doubt , that they do . "
111720	111812	111813	111813	he	82	" I came out to find myself in presence of new facts - facts that have kept striking me as less and less met by our old reasons . The matter 's perfectly simple . New reasons - reasons as new as the facts themselves - are wanted ; and of this our friends at Woollett - Chad 's and mine - were at the earliest moment definitely notified . If any are producible Mrs. Pocock will produce them ; she 'll bring over the whole collection . They 'll be , "
111819	111831	111813	111813	he	82	" a part of the ' fun ' you speak of . "
111845	111867	111832	111832	She	1601	" It 's Mamie - so far as I 've had it from you - who 'll be their great card . "
111882	111891	111878	111878	she	1601	" I think I 'm sorry for her . "
111892	111898	111878	111878	she	1601	" I think I am ! "
111915	111923	111901	111901	Strether	82	" But it ca n't be helped . "
111924	111934	111935	111935	He	82	" You mean her coming out ca n't be ? "
111944	111986	111935	111935	He	82	" The only way for her not to come is for me to go home - as I believe that on the spot I could prevent it . But the difficulty as to that is that if I do go home - "
111987	111993	111995	111995	she	1601	" I see , I see "
112000	112012	112014	112014	she	1601	" Mr. Newsome will do the same , and that 's not "
112019	112025	112014	112014	she	1601	" to be thought of . "
112049	112056	112031	112031	he	82	" Strange , is n't it ? "
112147	112156	112141	112141	she	1601	" Will Mr. Newsome introduce his sister - ? "
112157	112163	112164	112164	Strether	82	" To Madame de Vionnet ? "
112171	112182	112164	112164	Strether	82	" I shall be greatly surprised if he does n't . "
112191	112204	112183	112183	She	1601	" You mean you 've thought of it and you 're prepared . "
112205	112216	112224	112224	she	1601	" I 've thought of it and I 'm prepared . "
112229	112236	112224	112224	she	1601	" Bon ! You ARE magnificent ! "
112237	112240	112241	112241	he	82	" Well , "
112258	112282	112241	112241	he	82	" well , that 's what , just once in all my dull days , I think I shall like to have been ! "
112386	112404	112405	112405	He	82	" Judge best to take another month , but with full appreciation of all re - enforcements . "
112978	112983	112985	112985	he	82	" in his life , "
113029	113032	113034	113038	deep devoted delicate sensitive noble	1611	" cold , "
113904	113910	113995	113995	she	88	" My coming to grief ? "
113911	113921	113882	113882	she	88	" Yes - then I might patch you up . "
113922	113940	113995	113995	she	88	" Oh for my real smash , if it takes place , there will be no patching . "
113941	113953	113995	113995	she	88	" But you surely do n't mean it will kill you . "
113954	113965	113995	113995	she	88	" No - worse . It will make me old . "
113966	113993	113995	113995	she	88	" Ah nothing can do that ! The wonderful and special thing about you is that you ARE , at this time of day , youth . "
114058	114066	114042	114042	She	88	" It 's just your particular charm . "
114075	114480	114067	114067	His	82	" Of course I 'm youth - youth for the trip to Europe . I began to be young , or at least to get the benefit of it , the moment I met you at Chester , and that 's what has been taking place ever since . I never had the benefit at the proper time - which comes to saying that I never had the thing itself . I 'm having the benefit at this moment ; I had it the other day when I said to Chad ' Wait ' ; I shall have it still again when Sarah Pocock arrives . It 's a benefit that would make a poor show for many people ; and I do n't know who else but you and I , frankly , could begin to see in it what I feel . I do n't get drunk ; I do n't pursue the ladies ; I do n't spend money ; I do n't even write sonnets . But nevertheless I 'm making up late for what I did n't have early . I cultivate my little benefit in my own little way . It amuses me more than anything that has happened to me in all my life . They may say what they like - it 's my surrender , it 's my tribute , to youth . One puts that in where one can - it has to come in somewhere , if only out of the lives , the conditions , the feelings of other persons . Chad gives me the sense of it , for all his grey hairs , which merely make it solid in him and safe and serene ; and SHE does the same , for all her being older than he , for all her marriageable daughter , her separated husband , her agitated history . Though they 're young enough , my pair , I do n't say they 're , in the freshest way , their own absolutely prime adolescence ; for that has nothing to do with it . The point is that they 're mine . Yes , they 're my youth ; since somehow at the right time nothing else ever was . What I meant just now therefore is that it would all go - go before doing its work - if they were to fail me . "
114492	114504	114487	114488	Miss Gostrey	99	" What do you , in particular , call its work ? "
114505	114513	114067	114067	His	82	" Well , to see me through . "
114514	114519	114521	114521	she	99	" But through what ? "
114531	114537	114521	114521	she	99	" Why through this experience . "
114556	114579	114521	114521	she	99	" Do n't you remember how in those first days of our meeting it was I who was to see you through ? "
114580	114586	114588	114588	he	1626	" Remember ? Tenderly , deeply "
114594	114609	114588	114588	he	1626	" You 're just doing your part in letting me maunder to you thus . "
114610	114628	114521	114521	she	99	" Ah do n't speak as if my part were small ; since whatever else fails you - "
114629	114640	114642	114642	he	1626	" YOU wo n't , ever , ever , ever ? "
114648	114681	114642	114642	he	1626	" Oh I beg your pardon ; you necessarily , you inevitably WILL . Your conditions - that 's what I mean - wo n't allow me anything to do for you . "
114682	114727	114521	114521	she	99	" Let alone - I see what you mean - that I 'm drearily dreadfully old . I AM , but there 's a service - possible for you to render - that I know , all the same , I shall think of . "
114728	114735	114642	114642	he	1626	" And what will it be ? "
114749	114774	114521	114521	she	99	" You shall hear only if your smash takes place . As that 's really out of the question , I wo n't expose myself "
117062	117074	117075	117076	our friend	235	" I shall look to you , you know , immensely , "
117080	117087	117075	117076	our friend	235	" to help me with them , "
117460	117614	117615	117615	I	0	" as Waymarsh had probably described him . He was letting himself at present , go ; there was no denying it ; it might be desperation , it might be confidence ; he should offer himself to the arriving travellers bristling with all the lucidity he had cultivated . He repeated to Chad what he had been saying in the court to Waymarsh ; how there was no doubt whatever that his sister would find the latter a kindred spirit , no doubt of the alliance , based on an exchange of views , that the pair would successfully strike up . They would become as thick as thieves - which moreover was but a development of what Strether remembered to have said in one of his first discussions with his mate , struck as he had then already been with the elements of affinity between that personage and Mrs. Newsome herself . "
117693	117694	117689	117689	she	113	" "
117697	117701	117689	117689	she	113	" said Chad , "
117709	117710	117707	117707	Sally	126	" "
117745	117749	117741	117743	the outgoing ambassador	1697	" said Strether , "
117757	118173	117741	117743	the outgoing ambassador	1697	" A moment after speaking as he had just done he felt he had inadvertently rather cheapened Mrs. Newsome to her son ; an impression audibly reflected , as at first seen , in Chad 's prompt protest . He had recently rather failed of apprehension of the young man 's attitude and temper - remaining principally conscious of how little worry , at the worst , he wasted , and he studied him at this critical hour with renewed interest . Chad had done exactly what he had promised him a fortnight previous - had accepted without another question his plea for delay . He was waiting cheerfully and handsomely , but also inscrutably and with a slight increase perhaps of the hardness originally involved in his acquired high polish . He was neither excited nor depressed ; was easy and acute and deliberate - unhurried unflurried unworried , only at most a little less amused than usual . Strether felt him more than ever a justification of the extraordinary process of which his own absurd spirit had been the arena ; he knew as their cab rolled along , knew as he had n't even yet known , that nothing else than what Chad had done and had been would have led to his present showing . They had made him , these things , what he was , and the business had n't been easy ; it had taken time and trouble , it had cost , above all , a price . The result at any rate was now to be offered to Sally ; which Strether , so far as that was concerned , was glad to be there to witness . Would she in the least make it out or take it in , the result , or would she in the least care for it if she did ? He scratched his chin as he asked himself by what name , when challenged - as he was sure he should be - he could call it for her . Oh those were determinations she must herself arrive at ; since she wanted so much to see , let her see then and welcome . She had come out in the pride of her competence , yet it hummed in Strether 's inner sense that she practically would n't see . That this was moreover what Chad shrewdly suspected was clear from a word that next dropped from him . "
118183	118253	118178	118178	they	1699	" - and the exclamation was significant and reassuring . It implied that he had n't then , for his companion 's sensibility , appeared to give Mrs. Newsome away ; and it facilitated our friend 's presently asking him if it were his idea that Mrs. Pocock and Madame de Vionnet should become acquainted . Strether was still more sharply struck , hereupon , with Chad 's lucidity . "
118278	118279	118272	118272	she	1701	" "
118288	118301	118282	118282	I	0	" Strether unguardedly replied . Chad 's quick rejoinder lighted his precipitation . "

118498	118552	118491	118491	you	0	" Chad 's urbanity fairly shamed him , and he was at this moment absolutely impatient to see the face Sarah Pocock would present to a sort of thing , as he synthetically phrased it to himself , with no adequate forecast of which , despite his admonitions , she would certainly arrive .

118726	118736	118702	118702	Strether	82	" You do n't begin to know HOW wonderful ! "
118808	118841	118916	118916	they	1704	" Well , I shall see her oftener now . I shall see her as much as I like - by your leave ; which is what I hitherto have n't done . "
118842	118847	118849	118849	Chad	111	" It has been , "
118855	118893	118849	118849	Chad	111	" only your own fault . I tried to bring you together , and SHE , my dear fellow - I never saw her more charming to any man . But you 've got your extraordinary ideas . "
118894	118901	118910	118910	they	1704	" Well , I DID have , "
119395	119445	119356	119356	he	82	" She has n't come out , you know , to be bamboozled . We may all be ravishing - nothing perhaps can be more easy for us ; but she has n't come out to be ravished . She has come out just simply to take you home . "
119446	119456	119458	119458	Chad	111	" Oh well , with HER I 'll go , "
119463	119471	119458	119458	Chad	111	" I suppose you 'll allow THAT . "
119482	119500	119478	119478	Strether	82	" Or is your idea that when I 've seen her I sha n't want to go ? "
119517	119539	119512	119512	he	82	" My own idea at any rate is that they shall have while they 're here the best sort of time . "
119548	119564	119545	119545	Strether	82	" Ah there you are ! I think if you really wanted to go - ! "
119565	119568	119570	119570	Chad	111	" Well ? "
119576	119600	119570	119570	Chad	111	" Well , you would n't trouble about our good time . You would n't care what sort of a time we have . "
119616	119631	119601	119601	Chad	111	" I see . But can I help it ? I 'm too decent . "
119632	119640	119641	119641	Strether	82	" Yes , you 're too decent ! "
119690	119701	119678	119678	he	111	" Do you mean to introduce her to Miss Gostrey ? "
119709	119712	119678	119678	he	111	" No . "
119713	119725	119678	119678	he	111	" But have n't you told me they know about her ? "
119726	119737	119678	119678	he	111	" I think I 've told you your mother knows . "
119738	119747	119678	119678	he	111	" And wo n't she have told Sally ? "
119748	119760	119678	119678	he	111	" That 's one of the things I want to see . "
119761	119770	119678	119678	he	111	" And if you find she HAS - ? "
119771	119783	119678	119678	he	111	" Will I then , you mean , bring them together ? "
119784	119787	119789	119789	Chad	111	" Yes , "
119795	119805	119789	119789	Chad	111	" to show her there 's nothing in it . "
119809	119828	119806	119806	Strether	82	" I do n't know that I care very much what she may think there 's in it . "
119829	119838	119678	119678	he	111	" Not if it represents what Mother thinks ? "
119839	119847	119678	119678	he	111	" Ah what DOES your mother think ? "
119879	119898	119678	119678	he	111	" Is n't that , my dear man , what we 're both just going to make out ? "
120605	120607	120613	120613	her	126	" brow "
120676	120680	120674	120674	Woollett	87	" their own . "
120766	121415	122017	122017	I	0	" He had taken this measure in solitude and meditation : but the catastrophe , as Sarah steamed up , looked for its seconds unprecedentedly dreadful - or proved , more exactly , altogether unthinkable ; so that his finding something free and familiar to respond to brought with it an instant renewal of his loyalty . He had suddenly sounded the whole depth , had gasped at what he might have lost . Well , he could now , for the quarter of an hour of their detention hover about the travellers as soothingly as if their direct message to him was that he had lost nothing . He was n't going to have Sarah write to her mother that night that he was in any way altered or strange . There had been times enough for a month when it had seemed to him that he was strange , that he was altered , in every way ; but that was a matter for himself ; he knew at least whose business it was not ; it was not at all events such a circumstance as Sarah 's own unaided lights would help her to . Even if she had come out to flash those lights more than yet appeared she would n't make much headway against mere pleasantness . He counted on being able to be merely pleasant to the end , and if only from incapacity moreover to formulate anything different . He could n't even formulate to himself his being changed and queer ; it had taken place , the process , somewhere deep down ; Maria Gostrey had caught glimpses of it ; but how was he to fish it up , even if he desired , for Mrs. Pocock ? This was then the spirit in which he hovered , and with the easier throb in it much indebted furthermore to the impression of high and established adequacy as a pretty girl promptly produced in him by Mamie . He had wondered vaguely - turning over many things in the fidget of his thoughts - if Mamie WERE as pretty as Woollett published her ; as to which issue seeing her now again was to be so swept away by Woollett 's opinion that this consequence really let loose for the imagination an avalanche of others . There were positively five minutes in which the last word seemed of necessity to abide with a Woollett represented by a Mamie . This was the sort of truth the place itself would feel ; it would send her forth in confidence ; it would point to her with triumph ; it would take its stand on her with assurance ; it would be conscious of no requirements she did n't meet , of no question she could n't answer . Well , it was right , Strether slipped smoothly enough into the cheerfulness of saying : granted that a community MIGHT be best represented by a young lady of twenty - two , Mamie perfectly played the part , played it as if she were used to it , and looked and spoke and dressed the character . He wondered if she might n't , in the high light of Paris , a cool full studio - light , becoming yet treacherous , show as too conscious of these matters ; but the next moment he felt satisfied that her consciousness was after all empty for its size , rather too simple than too mixed , and that the kind way with her would be not to take many things out of it , but to put as many as possible in . She was robust and conveniently tall ; just a trifle too bloodlessly fair perhaps , but with a pleasant public familiar radiance that affirmed her vitality . She might have been "
121417	121493	122075	122075	you	1744	" for Woollett , wherever she found herself , and there was something in her manner , her tone , her motion , her pretty blue eyes , her pretty perfect teeth and her very small , too small , nose , that immediately placed her , to the fancy , between the windows of a hot bright room in which voices were high - up at that end to which people were brought to be "
121496	122016	122017	122017	I	0	" They were there to congratulate , these images , and Strether 's renewed vision , on this hint , completed the idea . What Mamie was like was the happy bride , the bride after the church and just before going away . She was n't the mere maiden , and yet was only as much married as that quantity came to . She was in the brilliant acclaimed festal stage . Well , might it last her long ! Strether rejoiced in these things for Chad , who was all genial attention to the needs of his friends , besides having arranged that his servant should reinforce him ; the ladies were certainly pleasant to see , and Mamie would be at any time and anywhere pleasant to exhibit . She would look extraordinarily like his young wife - the wife of a honeymoon , should he go about with her ; but that was his own affair - or perhaps it was hers ; it was at any rate something she could n't help . Strether remembered how he had seen him come up with Jeanne de Vionnet in Gloriani 's garden , and the fancy he had had about that - the fancy obscured now , thickly overlaid with others ; the recollection was during these minutes his only note of trouble . He had often , in spite of himself , wondered if Chad but too probably were not with Jeanne the object of a still and shaded flame . It was on the cards that the child MIGHT be tremulously in love , and this conviction now flickered up not a bit the less for his disliking to think of it , for its being , in a complicated situation , a complication the more , and for something indescribable in Mamie , something at all events straightway lent her by his own mind , something that gave her value , gave her intensity and purpose , as the symbol of an opposition . Little Jeanne was n't really at all in question - how COULD she be ? - yet from the moment Miss Pocock had shaken her skirts on the platform , touched up the immense bows of her hat and settled properly over her shoulder the strap of her morocco - and - gilt travelling - satchel , from that moment little Jeanne was opposed . It was in the cab with Jim that impressions really crowded on Strether , giving him the strangest sense of length of absence from people among whom he had lived for years . Having them thus come out to him was as if he had returned to find them : and the droll promptitude of Jim 's mental reaction threw his own initiation far back into the past . Whoever might or might n't be suited by what was going on among them , Jim , for one , would certainly be : his instant recognition - frank and whimsical - of what the affair was for HIM gave Strether a glow of pleasure . "
122039	122073	122075	122075	you	1744	" so he broke out as the charming streets met his healthy appetite ; and he wound up , after an expressive nudge , with a clap of his companion 's knee and an "
122084	122596	122079	122079	you	1744	" that was charged with rich meaning . Strether felt in it the intention of homage , but , with a curiosity otherwise occupied , postponed taking it up . What he was asking himself for the time was how Sarah Pocock , in the opportunity already given her , had judged her brother - from whom he himself , as they finally , at the station , separated for their different conveyances , had had a look into which he could read more than one message . However Sarah was judging her brother , Chad 's conclusion about his sister , and about her husband and her husband 's sister , was at the least on the way not to fail of confidence . Strether felt the confidence , and that , as the look between them was an exchange , what he himself gave back was relatively vague . This comparison of notes however could wait ; everything struck him as depending on the effect produced by Chad . Neither Sarah nor Mamie had in any way , at the station - where they had had after all ample time - broken out about it ; which , to make up for this , was what our friend had expected of Jim as soon as they should find themselves together . It was queer to him that he had that noiseless brush with Chad ; an ironic intelligence with this youth on the subject of his relatives , an intelligence carried on under their nose and , as might be said , at their expense - such a matter marked again for him strongly the number of stages he had come ; albeit that if the number seemed great the time taken for the final one was but the turn of a hand . He had before this had many moments of wondering if he himself were n't perhaps changed even as Chad was changed . Only what in Chad was conspicuous improvement - well , he had no name ready for the working , in his own organism , of his own more timid dose . He should have to see first what this action would amount to . And for his occult passage with the young man , after all , the directness of it had no greater oddity than the fact that the young man 's way with the three travellers should have been so happy a manifestation . Strether liked him for it , on the spot , as he had n't yet liked him ; it affected him while it lasted as he might have been affected by some light pleasant perfect work of art : to that degree that he wondered if they were really worthy of it , took it in and did it justice ; to that degree that it would have been scarce a miracle if , there in the luggage - room , while they waited for their things , Sarah had pulled his sleeve and drawn him aside . "
122638	124176	124190	124190	You	0	" On which they might , as it were , have embraced and begun to work together . Ah how much , as it was , for all her bridling brightness - which was merely general and noticed nothing - WOULD they work together ? Strether knew he was unreasonable ; he set it down to his being nervous : people could n't notice everything and speak of everything in a quarter of an hour . Possibly , no doubt , also , he made too much of Chad 's display . Yet , none the less , when , at the end of five minutes , in the cab , Jim Pocock had said nothing either - had n't said , that is , what Strether wanted , though he had said much else - it all suddenly bounced back to their being either stupid or wilful . It was more probably on the whole the former ; so that that would be the drawback of the bridling brightness . Yes , they would bridle and be bright ; they would make the best of what was before them , but their observation would fail ; it would be beyond them ; they simply would n't understand . Of what use would it be then that they had come ? - if they were n't to be intelligent up to THAT point : unless indeed he himself were utterly deluded and extravagant ? Was he , on this question of Chad 's improvement , fantastic and away from the truth ? Did he live in a false world , a world that had grown simply to suit him , and was his present slight irritation - in the face now of Jim 's silence in particular - but the alarm of the vain thing menaced by the touch of the real ? Was this contribution of the real possibly the mission of the Pococks ? - had they come to make the work of observation , as HE had practised observation , crack and crumble , and to reduce Chad to the plain terms in which honest minds could deal with him ? Had they come in short to be sane where Strether was destined to feel that he himself had only been silly ? He glanced at such a contingency , but it failed to hold him long when once he had reflected that he would have been silly , in this case , with Maria Gostrey and little Bilham , with Madame de Vionnet and little Jeanne , with Lambert Strether , in fine , and above all with Chad Newsome himself . Would n't it be found to have made more for reality to be silly with these persons than sane with Sarah and Jim ? Jim in fact , he presently made up his mind , was individually out of it ; Jim did n't care ; Jim had n't come out either for Chad or for him ; Jim in short left the moral side to Sally and indeed simply availed himself now , for the sense of recreation , of the fact that he left almost everything to Sally . He was nothing compared to Sally , and not so much by reason of Sally 's temper and will as by that of her more developed type and greater acquaintance with the world . He quite frankly and serenely confessed , as he sat there with Strether , that he felt his type hang far in the rear of his wife 's and still further , if possible , in the rear of his sister 's . Their types , he well knew , were recognised and acclaimed ; whereas the most a leading Woollett business - man could hope to achieve socially , and for that matter industrially , was a certain freedom to play into this general glamour . The impression he made on our friend was another of the things that marked our friend 's road . It was a strange impression , especially as so soon produced ; Strether had received it , he judged , all in the twenty minutes ; it struck him at least as but in a minor degree the work of the long Woollett years . Pocock was normally and consentingly though not quite wittingly out of the question . It was despite his being normal ; it was despite his being cheerful ; it was despite his being a leading Woollett business - man ; and the determination of his fate left him thus perfectly usual - as everything else about it was clearly , to his sense , not less so . He seemed to say that there was a whole side of life on which the perfectly usual WAS for leading Woollett business - men to be out of the question . He made no more of it than that , and Strether , so far as Jim was concerned , desired to make no more . Only Strether 's imagination , as always , worked , and he asked himself if this side of life were not somehow connected , for those who figured on it with the fact of marriage . Would HIS relation to it , had he married ten years before , have become now the same as Pocock 's ? Might it even become the same should he marry in a few months ? Should he ever know himself as much out of the question for Mrs. Newsome as Jim knew himself - in a dim way - for Mrs. Jim ? To turn his eyes in that direction was to be personally reassured ; he was different from Pocock ; he had affirmed himself differently and was held after all in higher esteem . What none the less came home to him , however , at this hour , was that the society over there , that of which Sarah and Mamie - and , in a more eminent way , Mrs. Newsome herself - were specimens , was essentially a society of women , and that poor Jim was n't in it . He himself Lambert Strether , WAS as yet in some degree - which was an odd situation for a man ; but it kept coming back to him in a whimsical way that he should perhaps find his marriage had cost him his place . This occasion indeed , whatever that fancy represented , was not a time of sensible exclusion for Jim , who was in a state of manifest response to the charm of his adventure . Small and fat and constantly facetious , straw - coloured and destitute of marks , he would have been practically indistinguishable had n't his constant preference for light - grey clothes , for white hats , for very big cigars and very little stories , done what it could for his identity . There were signs in him , though none of them plaintive , of always paying for others ; and the principal one perhaps was just this failure of type . It was with this that he paid , rather than with fatigue or waste ; and also doubtless a little with the effort of humour - never irrelevant to the conditions , to the relations , with which he was acquainted . He gurgled his joy as they rolled through the happy streets ; he declared that his trip was a regular windfall , and that he was n't there , he was eager to remark , to hang back from anything : he did n't know quite what Sally had come for , but HE had come for a good time . Strether indulged him even while wondering if what Sally wanted her brother to go back for was to become like her husband . He trusted that a good time was to be , out and out , the programme for all of them ; and he assented liberally to Jim 's proposal that , disencumbered and irresponsible - his things were in the omnibus with those of the others - they should take a further turn round before going to the hotel . It was n't for HIM to tackle Chad - it was Sally 's job ; and as it would be like her , he felt , to open fire on the spot , it would n't be amiss of them to hold off and give her time . Strether , on his side , only asked to give her time ; so he jogged with his companion along boulevards and avenues , trying to extract from meagre material some forecast of his catastrophe . He was quick enough to see that Jim Pocock declined judgement , had hovered quite round the outer edge of discussion and anxiety , leaving all analysis of their question to the ladies alone and now only feeling his way toward some small droll cynicism . It broke out afresh , the cynicism - it had already shown a flicker - in a but slightly deferred : "

124713	124722	124723	124723	I	0	" Strether made a reflexion of his own . "

124755	124759	124739	124740	your wife	1762	" Jim concurred - "

124845	124851	124839	124839	Woollett	87	" Strether continued to consider . "
124901	124906	124896	124896	She	113	" he went on . "

125034	125045	125046	125046	they	1772	" - and Strether 's concurrence had a positive precipitation ; "

125068	125079	125058	125058	They	1772	" said Jim , who seemed pleased with his analogy ; "

125109	125285	125104	125104	they	1772	" Strether replied with a laugh that justified his confession of nervousness . He disliked to be talking sincerely of Mrs. Newsome with Pocock ; he could have talked insincerely . But there was something he wanted to know , a need created in him by her recent intermission , by his having given from the first so much , as now more than ever appeared to him , and got so little . It was as if a queer truth in his companion 's metaphor had rolled over him with a rush . She HAD been quiet at feeding - time ; she had fed , and Sarah had fed with her , out of the big bowl of all his recent free communication , his vividness and pleasantness , his ingenuity and even his eloquence , while the current of her response had steadily run thin . Jim meanwhile however , it was true , slipped characteristically into shallowness from the moment he ceased to speak out of the experience of a husband . "
125313	125332	125333	125333	He	111	" He sighed with contingent pity at his brother - in - law 's possible want of resource . "
125345	125619	125333	125333	He	111	" and he asked the next moment if there were anything new at the Varieties , which he pronounced in the American manner . They talked about the Varieties - Strether confessing to a knowledge which produced again on Pocock 's part a play of innuendo as vague as a nursery - rhyme , yet as aggressive as an elbow in his side ; and they finished their drive under the protection of easy themes . Strether waited to the end , but still in vain , for any show that Jim had seen Chad as different ; and he could scarce have explained the discouragement he drew from the absence of this testimony . It was what he had taken his own stand on , so far as he had taken a stand ; and if they were all only going to see nothing he had only wasted his time . He gave his friend till the very last moment , till they had come into sight of the hotel ; and when poor Pocock only continued cheerful and envious and funny he fairly grew to dislike him , to feel him extravagantly common . If they were ALL going to see nothing ! - Strether knew , as this came back to him , that he was also letting Pocock represent for him what Mrs. Newsome would n't see . He went on disliking , in the light of Jim 's commonness , to talk to him about that lady ; yet just before the cab pulled up he knew the extent of his desire for the real word from Woollett . "
125629	125630	125621	125622	Mrs. Newsome	88	" "
125636	125653	125621	125622	Mrs. Newsome	88	" - Jim echoed it with the practical derision of his sense of a long past . "
125672	125673	125676	125676	she	88	" "
125682	125691	125676	125676	she	88	" - he had his categories in hand . "
125720	125721	125716	125716	they	1775	" "
125727	125732	125723	125723	Sarah	126	" Strether vaguely murmured . "
125745	125746	125740	125740	they	1775	" "
125754	125755	125748	125749	Mrs. Newsome	88	" "
125765	125808	125748	125749	Mrs. Newsome	88	" And Jim fetched him , with a vulgar little guffaw , a thrust that gave relief to the picture . But he had got what he wanted . He felt on the spot that this WAS the real word from Woollett . "
125816	126070	125812	125812	you	1081	" Jim added while he alighted and while his friend , letting him profusely pay the cabman , sat on in a momentary muse . Strether wondered if that were the real word too . III As the door of Mrs. Pocock 's salon was pushed open for him , the next day , well before noon , he was reached by a voice with a charming sound that made him just falter before crossing the threshold . Madame de Vionnet was already on the field , and this gave the drama a quicker pace than he felt it as yet - though his suspense had increased - in the power of any act of his own to do . He had spent the previous evening with all his old friends together yet he would still have described himself as quite in the dark in respect to a forecast of their influence on his situation . It was strange now , none the less , that in the light of this unexpected note of her presence he felt Madame de Vionnet a part of that situation as she had n't even yet been . She was alone , he found himself assuming , with Sarah , and there was a bearing in that - somehow beyond his control - on his personal fate . Yet she was only saying something quite easy and independent - the thing she had come , as a good friend of Chad 's , on purpose to say . "
126085	126447	126079	126079	I	0	" It was clear enough , when they were there before him , how she had been received . He saw this , as Sarah got up to greet him , from something fairly hectic in Sarah 's face . He saw furthermore that they were n't , as had first come to him , alone together ; he was at no loss as to the identity of the broad high back presented to him in the embrasure of the window furthest from the door . Waymarsh , whom he had to - day not yet seen , whom he only knew to have left the hotel before him , and who had taken part , the night previous , on Mrs. Pocock 's kind invitation , conveyed by Chad , in the entertainment , informal but cordial , promptly offered by that lady - Waymarsh had anticipated him even as Madame de Vionnet had done , and , with his hands in his pockets and his attitude unaffected by Strether 's entrance , was looking out , in marked detachment , at the Rue de Rivoli . The latter felt it in the air - it was immense how Waymarsh could mark things - -that he had remained deeply dissociated from the overture to their hostess that we have recorded on Madame de Vionnet 's side . He had , conspicuously , tact , besides a stiff general view ; and this was why he had left Mrs. Pocock to struggle alone . He would outstay the visitor ; he would unmistakeably wait ; to what had he been doomed for months past but waiting ? Therefore she was to feel that she had him in reserve . What support she drew from this was still to be seen , for , although Sarah was vividly bright , she had given herself up for the moment to an ambiguous flushed formalism . She had had to reckon more quickly than she expected ; but it concerned her first of all to signify that she was not to be taken unawares . Strether arrived precisely in time for her showing it . "
126488	126505	126484	126484	I	0	" said Sally Pocock in a tone that breathed a certain chill on Strether 's heart . "
126527	126534	126521	126525	a woman of good will	1782	" Madame de Vionnet threw off , "
126556	126791	126550	126550	we	1784	" She too , visibly , wished to make no mistake ; but it was a fear of a different order and more kept out of sight . She smiled in welcome at Strether ; she greeted him more familiarly than Mrs. Pocock ; she put out her hand to him without moving from her place ; and it came to him in the course of a minute and in the oddest way that - yes , positively - she was giving him over to ruin . She was all kindness and ease , but she could n't help so giving him ; she was exquisite , and her being just as she was poured for Sarah a sudden rush of meaning into his own equivocations . How could she know how she was hurting him ? She wanted to show as simple and humble - in the degree compatible with operative charm ; but it was just this that seemed to put him on her side . She struck him as dressed , as arranged , as prepared infinitely to conciliate - with the very poetry of good taste in her view of the conditions of her early call . She was ready to advise about dressmakers and shops ; she held herself wholly at the disposition of Chad 's family . Strether noticed her card on the table - her coronet and her "
126793	126822	126550	126550	we	1784	" - and the imagination was sharp in him of certain private adjustments in Sarah 's mind . She had never , he was sure , sat with a "
126824	127023	126550	126550	we	1784	" before , and such was the specimen of that class he had been keeping to play on her . She had crossed the sea very particularly for a look at her ; but he read in Madame de Vionnet 's own eyes that this curiosity had n't been so successfully met as that she herself would n't now have more than ever need of him . She looked much as she had looked to him that morning at Notre Dame ; he noted in fact the suggestive sameness of her discreet and delicate dress . It seemed to speak - perhaps a little prematurely or too finely - of the sense in which she would help Mrs. Pocock with the shops . The way that lady took her in , moreover , added depth to his impression of what Miss Gostrey , by their common wisdom , had escaped . He winced as he saw himself but for that timely prudence ushering in Maria as a guide and an example . There was however a touch of relief for him in his glimpse , so far as he had got it , of Sarah 's line . She "
127027	127042	126550	126550	we	1784	" Madame de Vionnet had , for that matter , lightly taken this up . "
127084	127292	127293	127293	Ah	1789	" And she appealed to Strether in the manner of a woman who could always glide off with smoothness into another subject . Was n't HE struck with the way Mr. Newsome had made the place his own , and had n't he been in a position to profit by his friend 's wondrous expertness ? Strether felt the bravery , at the least , of her presenting herself so promptly to sound that note , and yet asked himself what other note , after all , she COULD strike from the moment she presented herself at all . She could meet Mrs. Pocock only on the ground of the obvious , and what feature of Chad 's situation was more eminent than the fact that he had created for himself a new set of circumstances ? Unless she hid herself altogether she could show but as one of these , an illustration of his domiciled and indeed of his confirmed condition . And the consciousness of all this in her charming eyes was so clear and fine that as she thus publicly drew him into her boat she produced in him such a silent agitation as he was not to fail afterwards to denounce as pusillanimous . "
127335	127579	127293	127293	Ah	1789	" He recognised once more the perverse law that so inveterately governed his poor personal aspects : it would be exactly LIKE the way things always turned out for him that he should affect Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh as launched in a relation in which he had really never been launched at all . They were at this very moment - they could only be - attributing to him the full licence of it , and all by the operation of her own tone with him ; whereas his sole licence had been to cling with intensity to the brink , not to dip so much as a toe into the flood . But the flicker of his fear on this occasion was not , as may be added , to repeat itself ; it sprang up , for its moment , only to die down and then go out for ever . To meet his fellow visitor 's invocation and , with Sarah 's brilliant eyes on him , answer , WAS quite sufficiently to step into her boat . During the rest of the time her visit lasted he felt himself proceed to each of the proper offices , successively , for helping to keep the adventurous skiff afloat . It rocked beneath him , but he settled himself in his place . He took up an oar and , since he was to have the credit of pulling , pulled . "
127596	127644	127647	127647	he	1793	" Madame de Vionnet had further observed in reference to Mrs. Pocock 's mention of her initiated state ; and she had immediately added that , after all , her hostess could n't be in need with the good offices of Mr. Strether so close at hand . "
127711	127715	127705	127706	Mr. Strether	82	" she smiled , "
127725	127726	127705	127706	Mr. Strether	82	" "
127737	127760	127728	127728	I	0	" Strether answered , feeling quite as if he had been called upon to hint to Mrs. Pocock how Parisians could talk . "
127800	127837	127786	127786	I	0	" He looked at Sarah in a manner that he thought she might take as engaging , and he made , under Madame de Vionnet 's protection , as it were , his first personal point . "
127859	127877	127878	127878	You	0	" Yet it only at first gave Madame de Vionnet a chance immediately to take him up . "
127894	127939	127945	127945	he	632	" She spoke with such cheerful helpfulness that they might , in a common cause , have been calling together and pledged to mutual aid . Waymarsh , at this , as if he had been in question , straightway turned from the window . "
127992	127993	127984	127984	he	82	" "
127998	128004	127996	127996	YOU	0	" said the Countess gaily , "
128071	128160	128161	128161	I	0	" Madame de Vionnet , with her eyes on Sarah , bravely continued . Mrs. Pocock met her handsomely , but Strether quickly saw she meant to accept no version of her movements or plans from any other lips . She required no patronage and no support , which were but other names for a false position ; she would show in her own way what she chose to show , and this she expressed with a dry glitter that recalled to him a fine Woollett winter morning . "
128203	128210	128197	128197	We	1801	" Sarah continued a little piercingly , "
128215	128247	128248	128248	I	0	" - and in short she would n't give herself the least little scrap away . But she added as one who was always bland and who could afford a concession : "
128260	128261	128248	128248	I	0	" "
128266	128452	128248	128248	I	0	" - Madame de Vionnet breathed it to the air . Five minutes later they were on their feet for her to take leave , standing together in an affability that had succeeded in surviving a further exchange of remarks ; only with the emphasised appearance on Waymarsh 's part of a tendency to revert , in a ruminating manner and as with an instinctive or a precautionary lightening of his tread , to an open window and his point of vantage . The glazed and gilded room , all red damask , ormolu , mirrors , clocks , looked south , and the shutters were bowed upon the summer morning ; but the Tuileries garden and what was beyond it , over which the whole place hung , were things visible through gaps ; so that the far - spreading presence of Paris came up in coolness , dimness and invitation , in the twinkle of gilt - tipped palings , the crunch of gravel , the click of hoofs , the crack of whips , things that suggested some parade of the circus . "
128458	128463	128453	128453	I	0	" said Mrs. Pocock , "
128486	128530	128531	128531	I	0	" She spoke as to Strether , but her face was turned with an intensity of brightness to Madame de Vionnet , and there was a moment during which , while she thus fronted her , our friend expected to hear her add : "
128547	128640	128536	128536	you	1805	" He guessed that for five seconds these words were on the point of coming ; he heard them as clearly as if they had been spoken ; but he presently knew they had just failed - knew it by a glance , quick and fine , from Madame de Vionnet , which told him that she too had felt them in the air , but that the point had luckily not been made in any manner requiring notice . This left her free to reply only to what had been said . "
128666	128667	128536	128536	you	1805	" "
128682	128794	128795	128795	I	0	" : and Mrs. Pocock looked her invader well in the eyes . The flush in Sarah 's cheeks had by this time settled to a small definite crimson spot that was not without its own bravery ; she held her head a good deal up , and it came to Strether that of the two , at this moment , she was the one who most carried out the idea of a Countess . He quite took in , however , that she would really return her visitor 's civility : she would n't report again at Woollett without at least so much producible history as that in her pocket . "
128808	128815	128817	128817	I	0	" Madame de Vionnet went on ; "
128900	128908	128895	128896	Mr. Strether	82	" - she beautifully kept it up - "
128971	129127	128951	128951	he	82	" She seemed to ask him for permission to say these things , or seemed rather to take it , softly and happily , with the ease of intimacy , for granted , and he had quite the consciousness now that not to meet her at any point more than halfway would be odiously , basely to abandon her . Yes , he was WITH her , and , opposed even in this covert , this semi - safe fashion to those who were not , he felt , strangely and confusedly , but excitedly , inspiringly , how much and how far . It was as if he had positively waited in suspense for something from her that would let him in deeper , so that he might show her how he could take it . And what did in fact come as she drew out a little her farewell served sufficiently the purpose . "
129172	129182	129161	129161	me	0	" she added as she addressed herself to him ; "
129226	129231	129220	129221	Mrs. Pocock	113	" she wound up , "
129248	129249	129250	129250	I	0	" "
129283	129287	129274	129275	Mr. Strether	82	" Sarah allowed , "
129306	129307	129298	129298	I	0	" "
129314	129320	129321	129321	I	0	" he freely broke in , "
129366	129370	129360	129360	I	0	" he laughed , "
129378	129487	129373	129373	you	126	" She met him , Mrs. Pocock , on this , with an arrest of speech - with a certain breathlessness , as he immediately fancied , on the score of a freedom for which she was n't quite prepared . It had flared up - for all the harm he had intended by it - because , confoundedly , he did n't want any more to be afraid about her than he wanted to be afraid about Madame de Vionnet . He had never , naturally , called her anything but Sarah at home , and though he had perhaps never quite so markedly invoked her as his "
129490	129544	129373	129373	you	126	" that was somehow partly because no occasion had hitherto laid so effective a trap for it . But something admonished him now that it was too late - unless indeed it were possibly too early ; and that he at any rate should n't have pleased Mrs. Pocock the more by it . "
129551	129670	129547	129548	Mr. Strether	82	" she murmured with vagueness , yet with sharpness , while her crimson spot burned a trifle brighter and he was aware that this must be for the present the limit of her response . Madame de Vionnet had already , however , come to his aid , and Waymarsh , as if for further participation , moved again back to them . It was true that the aid rendered by Madame de Vionnet was questionable ; it was a sign that , for all one might confess to with her , and for all she might complain of not enjoying , she could still insidiously show how much of the material of conversation had accumulated between them . "
129705	129712	129702	129702	you	82	" she enquired of Mrs. Pocock , "
129730	129731	129726	129728	a wonderful woman	1821	" "
129736	129742	129726	129728	a wonderful woman	1821	" Strether answered for her , "
129767	129772	129762	129763	your mother	1043	" he sturdily pursued . "
129778	129788	129774	129774	I	0	" he added with his conscious gaiety of courage , "
129800	129801	129790	129790	she	99	" "
129823	129829	129813	129814	Mr. Strether	82	" Sarah Pocock promptly protested ; "
129858	129859	129862	129862	he	1827	" "
129873	129881	129862	129862	he	1827	" Madame de Vionnet sympathetically threw in . "
129925	129926	129901	129901	He	1827	" "
129938	129963	129964	129964	Comment	178	" Waymarsh observed with weight and covering her with his large look ; which led her to break in before he could go on . "
129973	129980	129967	129967	he	1827	" she exclaimed in droll stupefaction . "
130009	130019	130020	130020	I	0	" But he only continued in his massive way . "
130084	130085	130116	130116	you	177	" "
130090	130097	130116	130116	you	177	" Madame de Vionnet quickly echoed . "
130112	130113	130099	130099	she	299	" "
130124	130130	130116	130116	you	177	" Waymarsh returned with spirit ; "
130162	130163	130157	130157	she	299	" "
130182	130437	130174	130174	Strether	82	" their fellow visitor laughed , keeping to her idea with a good conscience at which our friend was aware that he marvelled , though he trusted also for it , as he met her exquisitely expressive eyes , to some later light . The prime effect of her tone , however - and it was a truth which his own eyes gave back to her in sad ironic play - could only be to make him feel that , to say such things to a man in public , a woman must practically think of him as ninety years old . He had turned awkwardly , responsively red , he knew , at her mention of Maria Gostrey ; Sarah Pocock 's presence - the particular quality of it - had made this inevitable ; and then he had grown still redder in proportion as he hated to have shown anything at all . He felt indeed that he was showing much , as , uncomfortably and almost in pain , he offered up his redness to Waymarsh , who , strangely enough , seemed now to be looking at him with a certain explanatory yearning . Something deep - something built on their old old relation - passed , in this complexity , between them ; he got the side - wind of a loyalty that stood behind all actual queer questions . Waymarsh 's dry bare humour - as it gave itself to be taken - gloomed out to demand justice . "
130452	130495	130448	130448	MY	0	" it appeared stiffly to nod , and it granted that it was giving him away , but struggled to add that it did so only to save him . The sombre glow stared it at him till it fairly sounded out - "
130516	130595	130448	130448	MY	0	" Yet it was somehow just this communication that showed him to himself as more than ever lost . Still another result of it was to put before him as never yet that between his comrade and the interest represented by Sarah there was already a basis . Beyond all question now , yes : Waymarsh had been in occult relation with Mrs. Newsome - out , out it all came in the very effort of his face . "
130603	130612	130598	130598	you	1838	" - he as good as proclaimed it ; "
130647	130814	130821	130821	they	1839	" It was as if in short , after an instant , Strether had not only had it from him , but had recognised that so far as this went the instant had cleared the air . Our friend understood and approved ; he had the sense that they would n't otherwise speak of it . This would be all , and it would mark in himself a kind of intelligent generosity . It was with grim Sarah then - Sarah grim for all her grace - that Waymarsh had begun at ten o'clock in the morning to save him . Well - if he COULD , poor dear man , with his big bleak kindness ! The upshot of which crowded perception was that Strether , on his own side , still showed no more than he absolutely had to . He showed the least possible by saying to Mrs. Pocock after an interval much briefer than our glance at the picture reflected in him : "
130848	130849	130846	130846	myself	0	" "
130862	130897	130857	130857	you	0	" Sarah replied without looking at him and thrown for a moment by this discrimination , as the direction of her eyes showed , upon a dimly desperate little community with Madame de Vionnet . "
130909	130916	130901	130901	I	0	" Madame de Vionnet instantly rallied . "
130954	130955	130941	130941	She	99	" "
130960	130990	130941	130941	She	99	" Strether laughed while he wondered at the odd part he found thus imposed on him . It continued to be so by every touch from Madame de Vionnet . "
131049	131065	131043	131043	I	0	" Strether thought a moment while Waymarsh and Mrs. Pocock affected him as standing attentive . "
131083	131084	131077	131077	Chad	111	" "
131120	131126	131114	131114	I	0	" Madame de Vionnet declared , "
131133	131134	131128	131129	Mrs. Pocock	113	" "
131145	131152	131153	131153	I	0	" Sarah observed with reasserted suavity . "
131180	131194	131153	131153	I	0	" - and her voice seemed to caress that description of these persons . "
131198	131204	131153	131153	I	0	" her visitor cheerfully replied , "
131221	131227	131153	131153	I	0	" she continued to Strether . "
131235	131236	131153	131153	I	0	" "
131242	131243	131153	131153	I	0	" "
131256	131292	131153	131153	I	0	" It was ridiculous , but Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh struck him as fairly waiting for his answer . It was indeed as if they were arranged , gathered for a performance , the performance of "
131294	131310	131153	131153	I	0	" by his confederate and himself . Well , the performance could only go on . "
131317	131318	131153	131153	I	0	" "
131326	131351	131352	131352	I	0	" And now at last Madame de Vionnet must leave them , though it carried , for herself , the performance a little further . "
131368	131377	131378	131378	She	175	" Sarah hesitated , but she rose equal . "
131398	131399	131400	131400	I	0	" "
131471	131483	131466	131466	you	0	" After which the charming woman risked a more intense appeal . "
131507	131622	131623	131623	You	0	" Strether on his side waited , for Sarah likewise had , after all , to perform ; and it occupied him to have been thus reminded that she had stayed at home - and on her first morning of Paris - while Chad led the others forth . Oh she was up to her eyes ; if she had stayed at home she had stayed by an understanding , arrived at the evening before , that Waymarsh would come and find her alone . This was beginning well - for a first day in Paris ; and the thing might be amusing yet . But Madame de Vionnet 's earnestness was meanwhile beautiful . "
131659	131726	131650	131650	I	0	" The manner of this speech gave Strether such a sense of depths below it and behind it as he had n't yet had - ministered in a way that almost frightened him to his dim divinations of reasons ; but if Sarah still , in spite of it , faltered , this was why he had time for a sign of sympathy with her petitioner . "
131758	131778	131781	131781	Countess	177	" Even Waymarsh , though with more to produce on the subject , could get into motion in time . "
131823	131824	131847	131847	she	1854	" "
131828	131834	131847	131847	she	1854	" smiled Madame de Vionnet , "
131854	131882	131847	131847	she	1854	" It was wonderful , but what was scarce less so was that Strether found himself , by the quick effect of it , moved another way . "
131923	131935	131919	131921	Mademoiselle de Vionnet	154	" he explained , in considerable form , to Mrs. Pocock , "
131946	131956	131940	131942	Mademoiselle de Vionnet	154	" It had been perhaps a little portentous , but "
131959	131997	131998	131999	Miss Jane	181	" Sarah simply glittered . Waymarsh himself , for that matter , apparently recognised , in respect to the facts , the need of a larger justice , and he had with it an inclination to Sarah . "
132010	132045	132046	132046	You	177	" It somehow made both Strether and Madame de Vionnet laugh out , though at the very moment he caught in Sarah 's eyes , as glancing at the speaker , a vague but unmistakeable "
132049	132076	132046	132046	You	177	" It made Waymarsh in fact look consciously over her head . Madame de Vionnet meanwhile , however , made her point in her own way . "
132211	132242	132193	132193	he	114	" she wound up after Mrs. Pocock had signified , in a murmur still a little stiff , that she would speak to her own young charge on the question - "
132263	132273	132193	132193	he	114	" But her last fine turn was for Strether . "
132284	132285	132193	132193	he	114	" "
132309	132337	132303	132303	I	0	" he further declared ; and in proof of it , the next moment , he had gone with her down to her carriage . Book Ninth I "
132342	132355	132357	132357	I	0	" Strether said to Madame de Vionnet a couple of days later , "
132419	132991	132404	132404	you	1868	" It was so remarkable that our friend had pulled up before his hostess with the vision of it ; he had risen from his chair at the end of ten minutes and begun , as a help not to worry , to move about before her quite as he moved before Maria . He had kept his appointment with her to the minute and had been intensely impatient , though divided in truth between the sense of having everything to tell her and the sense of having nothing at all . The short interval had , in the face of their complication , multiplied his impressions - it being meanwhile to be noted , moreover , that he already frankly , already almost publicly , viewed the complication as common to them . If Madame de Vionnet , under Sarah 's eyes , had pulled him into her boat , there was by this time no doubt whatever that he had remained in it and that what he had really most been conscious of for many hours together was the movement of the vessel itself . They were in it together this moment as they had n't yet been , and he had n't at present uttered the least of the words of alarm or remonstrance that had died on his lips at the hotel . He had other things to say to her than that she had put him in a position ; so quickly had his position grown to affect him as quite excitingly , altogether richly , inevitable . That the outlook , however - given the point of exposure - had n't cleared up half so much as he had reckoned was the first warning she received from him on his arrival . She had replied with indulgence that he was in too great a hurry , and had remarked soothingly that if she knew how to be patient surely HE might be . He felt her presence , on the spot , he felt her tone and everything about her , as an aid to that effort ; and it was perhaps one of the proofs of her success with him that he seemed so much to take his ease while they talked . By the time he had explained to her why his impressions , though multiplied , still baffled him , it was as if he had been familiarly talking for hours . They baffled him because Sarah - well , Sarah was deep , deeper than she had ever yet had a chance to show herself . He did n't say that this was partly the effect of her opening so straight down , as it were , into her mother , and that , given Mrs. Newsome 's profundity , the shaft thus sunk might well have a reach ; but he was n't without a resigned apprehension that , at such a rate of confidence between the two women , he was likely soon to be moved to show how already , at moments , it had been for him as if he were dealing directly with Mrs. Newsome . Sarah , to a certainty , would have begun herself to feel it in him - and this naturally put it in her power to torment him the more . From the moment she knew he COULD be tormented - ! "
132998	133011	132404	132404	you	1868	" - his companion was surprised at his use of the word . "
133023	133024	133018	133018	I	0	" "
133032	133036	133037	133037	One	2797	" she smiled . "
133047	133048	133037	133037	One	2797	" "
133051	133055	133056	133056	one	2797	" he answered , "
133109	133113	133114	133114	I	0	" he pursued . "
133126	133144	133145	133145	I	0	" The picture at any rate stirred in her an appreciation that he felt to be sincere . "
133164	133199	133145	133145	I	0	" Well , kind was what he wanted to be ; yet even while her charming eyes rested on him with the truth of this he none the less had his humour of honesty . "
133210	133222	133204	133204	I	0	" he laughed , ' suspense about my own case too ! "
133223	133233	133240	133240	she	1872	" Oh yes - about your own case too ! "
133249	133254	133255	133255	he	572	" Not , however , "
133259	133290	133255	133255	he	572	" that I want to talk to you about that . It 's my own little affair , and I mentioned it simply as part of Mrs. Pocock 's advantage . "
133868	133879	133857	133857	she	85	" And does that strike you as such an age ? "
133887	133919	133920	133920	she	85	" Oh I wo n't pretend I do n't miss him . Sometimes I see him every day . Our friendship 's like that . Make what you will of it ! "
133952	133959	133960	133960	she	85	" But he 's perfectly right , "
133965	134009	133960	133960	she	85	" and I would n't have him fail in any way at present for the world . I 'd sooner not see him for three months . I begged him to be beautiful to them , and he fully feels it for himself . "
134078	134134	134135	134135	Strether	82	" Oh he 's giving himself up , and he 'll do so to the end . How can he but want , now that it 's within reach , his full impression ? - which is much more important , you know , than either yours or mine . But he 's just soaking , "
134142	134162	134135	134135	Strether	82	" he 's going in conscientiously for a saturation . I 'm bound to say he IS very good . "
134163	134166	134167	134167	she	85	" Ah , "
134171	134179	134167	134167	she	85	" to whom do you say it ? "
134186	134193	134194	134194	Strether	82	" He 's capable of anything . "
134199	134211	134212	134212	he	82	" Oh he 's excellent . I more and more like , "
134215	134222	134212	134212	he	82	" to see him with them ; "
134366	134380	134354	134354	he	82	" It 's a tremendous comfort to feel how one can trust him . "
134406	134417	134388	134388	she	85	" I mean for making a good show to them . "
134418	134421	134422	134422	she	85	" Yes , "
134426	134436	134437	134437	Strether	82	" but if they shut their eyes to it ! "
134446	134454	134437	134437	Strether	82	" Well perhaps that wo n't matter ! "
134455	134472	134437	134437	Strether	82	" You mean because he probably - do what they will - wo n't like them ? "
134473	134509	134437	134437	Strether	82	" Oh ' do what they will ' - ! They wo n't do much ; especially if Sarah has n't more - well , more than one has yet made out - to give . "
134516	134524	134510	134512	Madame de Vionnet	85	" Ah she has all her grace ! "
134567	134591	134592	134592	she	85	" She may be persuasive and caressing with him ; she may be eloquent beyond words . She may get hold of him , "
134596	134606	134592	134592	she	85	" well , as neither you nor I have . "
134607	134612	134559	134559	he	82	" Yes , she MAY "
134619	134639	134616	134616	Strether	82	" But he has spent all his time each day with Jim . He 's still showing Jim round . "
134644	134650	134616	134616	Strether	82	" Then how about Jim ? "
134659	134679	134680	134680	He	82	" Has n't he given you Jim ? Has n't he before this ' done ' him for you ? "
134688	134696	134697	134697	She	85	" Does n't he tell you things ? "
134700	134702	134697	134697	She	85	" No "
134713	134740	134741	134741	she	85	" Not as you do . You somehow make me see them - or at least feel them . And I have n't asked too much , "
134744	134756	134741	134741	she	85	" I 've of late wanted so not to worry him . "
134757	134766	134767	134767	he	82	" Ah for that , so have I , "
134818	134837	134838	134838	She	85	" You see Jim 's really immense . I think it will be Jim who 'll do it . "
134841	134847	134838	134838	She	85	" Get hold of him ? "
134848	134861	134863	134863	he	82	" No - just the other thing . Counteract Sarah 's spell . "
134878	134884	134863	134863	he	82	" Jim 's intensely cynical . "
134885	134890	134891	134893	Madame de Vionnet	85	" Oh dear Jim ! "
134897	134922	134891	134893	Madame de Vionnet	85	" Yes , literally - dear Jim ! He 's awful . What HE wants , heaven forgive him , is to help us . "
134923	134926	134928	134928	she	85	" You mean "
134932	134936	134928	134928	she	85	" help ME ? "
134937	134985	134863	134863	he	82	" Well , Chad and me in the first place . But he throws you in too , though without as yet seeing you much . Only , so far as he does see you - if you do n't mind - he sees you as awful . "
134986	134991	134891	134893	Madame de Vionnet	85	" ' Awful ' ? "
134998	135019	134993	134993	she	85	" A regular bad one - though of course of a tremendously superior kind . Dreadful , delightful , irresistible . "
135020	135035	134863	134863	he	82	" Ah dear Jim ! I should like to know him . I MUST . "
135036	135052	135053	135053	Strether	82	" Yes , naturally . But will it do ? You may , you know , "
135056	135060	135061	135061	She	85	" disappoint him . "
135069	135080	135081	135081	she	85	" I can but try . But my wickedness then , "
135085	135092	135081	135081	she	85	" is my recommendation for him ? "
135093	135270	135271	135271	Strether	82	" Your wickedness and the charms with which , in such a degree as yours , he associates it . He understands , you see , that Chad and I have above all wanted to have a good time , and his view is simple and sharp . Nothing will persuade him - in the light , that is , of my behaviour - that I really did n't , quite as much as Chad , come over to have one before it was too late . He would n't have expected it of me ; but men of my age , at Woollett - and especially the least likely ones - have been noted as liable to strange outbreaks , belated uncanny clutches at the unusual , the ideal . It 's an effect that a lifetime of Woollett has quite been observed as having ; and I thus give it to you , in Jim 's view , for what it 's worth . Now his wife and his mother - in - law , "
135276	135310	135311	135311	he	82	" have , as in honour bound , no patience with such phenomena , late or early - which puts Jim , as against his relatives , on the other side . Besides , "
135314	135331	135311	135311	he	82	" I do n't think he really wants Chad back . If Chad does n't come - "
135332	135336	135338	135340	Madame de Vionnet	85	" He 'll have "
135344	135351	135338	135340	Madame de Vionnet	85	" more of the free hand ? "
135352	135361	135271	135271	Strether	82	" Well , Chad 's the bigger man . "
135362	135377	135271	135271	Strether	82	" So he 'll work now , en dessous , to keep him quiet ? "
135378	135462	135463	135463	She	85	" No - he wo n't ' work ' at all , and he wo n't do anything en dessous . He 's very decent and wo n't be a traitor in the camp . But he 'll be amused with his own little view of our duplicity , he 'll sniff up what he supposes to be Paris from morning till night , and he 'll be , as to the rest , for Chad - well , just what he is . "
135468	135472	135473	135473	He	1892	" A warning ? "
135480	135489	135473	135473	He	1892	" You ARE as wonderful as everybody says ! "
135498	135565	135495	135495	he	1892	" I drove him about for his first hour , and do you know what - all beautifully unconscious - he most put before me ? Why that something like THAT is at bottom , as an improvement to his present state , as in fact the real redemption of it , what they think it may not be too late to make of our friend . "
135595	135606	135590	135590	he	1892	" But it IS too late . Thanks to you ! "
135618	135627	135628	135628	He	1892	" Oh ' me ' - after all ! "
135644	135655	135628	135628	He	1892	" Everything 's comparative . You 're better than THAT . "
135656	135658	135660	135660	she	85	" You "
135666	135672	135660	135660	she	85	" are better than anything . "
135679	135687	135674	135674	she	85	" WILL Mrs. Pocock come to me ? "
135688	135716	135717	135717	She	85	" Oh yes - she 'll do that . As soon , that is , as my friend Waymarsh - HER friend now - leaves her leisure . "
135722	135732	135717	135717	She	85	" Is he so much her friend as that ? "
135733	135746	135674	135674	she	85	" Why , did n't you see it all at the hotel ? "
135747	135749	135751	135751	she	85	" Oh "
135755	135780	135751	135751	she	85	" ' all ' is a good deal to say . I do n't know - I forget . I lost myself in HER . "
135781	135786	135787	135787	Strether	82	" You were splendid , "
135790	135826	135787	135787	Strether	82	" but ' all ' is n't a good deal to say : it 's only a little . Yet it 's charming so far as it goes . She wants a man to herself . "
135827	135835	135751	135751	she	85	" And has n't she got you ? "
135836	135855	135856	135856	Strether	82	" Do you think she looked at me - or even at you - as if she had ? "
135862	135887	135856	135856	Strether	82	" Every one , you see , must strike her as having somebody . You 've got Chad - and Chad has got you . "
135888	135891	135898	135898	she	1893	" I see "
135901	135908	135898	135898	she	1893	" And you 've got Maria . "
135918	135934	135911	135911	he	82	" I 've got Maria . And Maria has got me . So it goes . "
135935	135945	135898	135898	she	1893	" But Mr. Jim - whom has he got ? "
135946	135964	135893	135893	she	1893	" Oh he has got - or it 's as IF he had - the whole place . "
135965	135970	135972	135972	she	1893	" But for Mr. Waymarsh "
135975	135985	135986	135986	He	82	" is n't Miss Barrace before any one else ? "
135991	136027	135988	135988	his	82	" Miss Barrace is a raffinee , and her amusement wo n't lose by Mrs. Pocock . It will gain rather - especially if Sarah triumphs and she comes in for a view of it . "
136028	136035	135898	135898	she	1893	" How well you know us ! "
136046	136178	136036	136038	Madame de Vionnet	85	" No - it seems to me it 's we that I know . I know Sarah - it 's perhaps on that ground only that my feet are firm . Waymarsh will take her round while Chad takes Jim - and I shall be , I assure you delighted for both of them . Sarah will have had what she requires - she will have paid her tribute to the ideal ; and he will have done about the same . In Paris it 's in the air - so what can one do less ? If there 's a point that , beyond any other , Sarah wants to make , it 's that she did n't come out to be narrow . We shall feel at least that . "
136179	136182	136183	136183	she	1894	" Oh , "
136186	136209	136183	136183	she	1894	" the quantity we seem likely to ' feel ' ! But what becomes , in these conditions , of the girl ? "
136210	136224	136226	136226	Strether	82	" Of Mamie - if we 're all provided ? Ah for that , "
136228	136234	136226	136226	Strether	82	" you can trust Chad . "
136235	136247	136036	136038	Madame de Vionnet	85	" To be , you mean , all right to her ? "
136248	136323	136183	136183	she	1894	" To pay her every attention as soon as he has polished off Jim . He wants what Jim can give him - and what Jim really wo n't - though he has had it all , and more than all , from me . He wants in short his own personal impression , and he 'll get it - strong . But as soon as he has got it Mamie wo n't suffer . "
136324	136331	136332	136334	Madame de Vionnet	85	" Oh Mamie must n't SUFFER ! "
136344	136370	136339	136339	Strether	82	" Do n't fear . As soon as he has done with Jim , Jim will fall to me . And then you 'll see . "
136388	136395	136396	136396	she	85	" Is she really quite charming ? "
136415	136447	136399	136399	He	82	" I do n't know ; I 'm watching . I 'm studying the case , as it were - and I dare say I shall be able to tell you . "
136451	136457	136399	136399	He	82	" Is it a case ? "
136458	136473	136479	136479	her	85	" Yes - I think so . At any rate I shall see . ' "
136482	136483	136477	136477	you	82	" "
136486	136490	136477	136477	you	82	" he smiled - "
136507	136519	136501	136501	She	85	" It was as if he made it out for himself . "
136526	136527	136520	136520	She	85	" "
136533	136540	136544	136544	I	0	" He measured it , laughing . "
136547	136548	136544	136544	I	0	" "
136555	136556	136550	136550	you	82	" "
136566	136576	136563	136563	I	0	" Her intelligent eyes showed her thought of it . "
136593	136604	136589	136590	Miss Pocock	175	" He paused again , but he brought it out . "
136611	136612	136609	136609	Chad	111	" "
136628	136644	136624	136626	an old friend	1896	" At which Strether had a slow amused significant headshake that made her go on : "
136665	136666	136667	136667	She	175	" "
136673	136674	136667	136667	She	175	" "
136682	136688	136678	136678	she	175	" Strether gave it up . "
136704	136705	136694	136697	a deep little girl	1898	" "
136716	136717	136713	136713	she	175	" "
136748	136762	136740	136740	You	0	" Madame de Vionnet looked for the moment fairly bent on the chance . "
136778	136779	136775	136776	Mrs. Pocock	113	" "
136803	136804	136801	136801	Chad	111	" "
136807	136819	136801	136801	Chad	111	" wailed Madame de Vionnet , turning away a little wearily , "
136827	136856	136861	136861	him	111	" The tone of it made him look at her with a kindness that showed his vision of her suspense . But he fell back on his confidence . "
136869	136915	136864	136864	him	111	" He had indeed no sooner so spoken than the queer displacement of his point of view appeared again to come up for him in the very sound , which drew from him a short laugh , immediately checked . He became still more advisory . "
136933	136948	136928	136928	Mamie	97	" She looked for a moment as if she placed them face to face . "
136955	136964	136965	136965	Mamie	97	" He had another of his corrective headshakes . "
136972	136993	136970	136970	THEM	1902	" She looked at him hard , and then as if it were what she must always come back to : "
137005	137009	137001	137001	I	0	" she said , "
137024	137025	137021	137022	my child	1460	" "
137028	137046	137052	137052	she	1460	" - Strether waited with deference while she appeared to hesitate as to how to put it . "
137057	137082	137052	137052	she	1460	" Strether for a little met her eyes on it ; after which something that might have been unexpected to her came from him . "
137087	137103	137083	137085	Poor little duck	1906	" Not more expected for himself indeed might well have been her echo of it . "
137114	137118	137112	137112	herself	1460	" she said , "
137126	137127	137109	137109	she	1460	" "
137135	137136	137131	137131	she	1460	" "
137146	137156	137142	137144	the young lady	1154	" He thought again ; then with a laugh : "
137165	137406	137407	137407	They	1911	" And now at last he took leave of her , as he had been intending for five minutes . But she went part of the way with him , accompanying him out of the room and into the next and the next . Her noble old apartment offered a succession of three , the first two of which indeed , on entering , smaller than the last , but each with its faded and formal air , enlarged the office of the antechamber and enriched the sense of approach . Strether fancied them , liked them , and , passing through them with her more slowly now , met a sharp renewal of his original impression . He stopped , he looked back ; the whole thing made a vista , which he found high melancholy and sweet - full , once more , of dim historic shades , of the faint faraway cannon - roar of the great Empire . It was doubtless half the projection of his mind , but his mind was a thing that , among old waxed parquets , pale shades of pink and green , pseudo - classic candelabra , he had always needfully to reckon with . They could easily make him irrelevant . The oddity , the originality , the poetry - he did n't know what to call it - of Chad 's connexion reaffirmed for him its romantic side . "
137419	137420	137421	137422	The Pococks	135	" "
137424	137441	137442	137442	Mamie	97	" - she looked about in deprecation ; she seemed to see gaps he did n't . "
137450	137451	137444	137444	Sarah	126	" "
137462	137463	137465	137465	their	1911	" "
137479	137480	137468	137468	You	0	" "
137487	137492	137468	137468	You	0	" she broke in , "
137501	137506	137468	137468	You	0	" she ruefully mused , "
137512	137513	137515	137515	you	1912	" "
137521	137526	137527	137527	I	0	" he went on . "
137537	137547	137531	137531	herself	88	" She stared , missing a little his logic . "
137554	137570	137531	137531	herself	88	" Her tone was so earnest that as he continued to look about he laughed . "
137574	137575	137531	137531	herself	88	" "
137586	137587	137582	137582	you	0	" "
137613	137614	137616	137616	you	0	" "
137618	137625	137616	137616	you	0	" she charmingly and sadly smiled . "
137633	137638	137639	137640	Mrs. Newsome	88	" he freely continued . "
137644	137656	137639	137640	Mrs. Newsome	88	" But she seemed doomed always to come back to doubt . "
137671	137672	137668	137669	any one	2912	" "
137687	137786	137787	137787	YOU	0	" They were by this time in the antechamber , still alone together , as she had n't rung for a servant . The antechamber was high and square , grave and suggestive too , a little cold and slippery even in summer , and with a few old prints that were precious , Strether divined , on the walls . He stood in the middle , slightly lingering , vaguely directing his glasses , while , leaning against the door - post of the room , she gently pressed her cheek to the side of the recess . "
137794	137795	137796	137796	I	0	" "
137798	137806	137796	137796	I	0	" - it startled him a little . "
137818	137835	137813	137813	You	0	" And then abruptly , as if bringing it out were somehow founded on that fact : "
137841	137897	137899	137899	You	0	" It affected him on the spot as a move in a game , and he was even then not without the sense that that was n't the way Jeanne should be married . But he quickly showed his interest , though - as quickly afterwards struck him - with an absurd confusion of mind . "
137910	137989	137908	137908	Chad	111	" Of course it was the child 's father who made the ' we , ' but to the child 's father it would have cost him an effort to allude . Yet did n't it seem the next minute that Monsieur de Vionnet was after all not in question ? - since she had gone on to say that it was indeed to Chad she referred and that he had been in the whole matter kindness itself . "
138047	138134	138040	138042	Monsieur de Vionnet	159	" It was the first time she had spoken to him of her husband , and he could n't have expressed how much more intimate with her it suddenly made him feel . It was n't much , in truth - there were other things in what she was saying that were far more ; but it was as if , while they stood there together so easily in these cold chambers of the past , the single touch had shown the reach of her confidence . "
138139	138143	138136	138137	our friend	235	" she asked , "
138150	138151	138152	138152	He	235	" "
138158	138159	138152	138152	He	235	" "
138211	138233	138204	138204	I	0	" The sense he had so often had , since the first hour of his disembarkment , of being further and further "
138236	138265	138204	138204	I	0	" treated him again at this moment to another twinge ; but in this wonderful way of her putting him in there continued to be something exquisitely remorseless . "
138310	138325	138306	138306	Chad	111	" she continued with her lighted , faintly flushed , her conscious confidential face , "
138365	138369	138370	138370	one	2797	" she smiled , "
138575	138590	138569	138569	I	0	" Strether , consciously gaping a little , had fairly hung upon her lips . "
138599	138606	138569	138569	I	0	" And then he permitted himself : "
138613	138614	138569	138569	I	0	" "
138651	138657	138649	138649	him	2833	" Strether just made sure . "
138668	138669	138649	138649	him	2833	" "
138678	138679	138649	138649	him	2833	" "
138683	138688	138692	138692	you	0	" said Strether decorously , "
138695	138911	138692	138692	you	0	" There seemed little else for him to say , though her communication had the oddest effect on him . Vaguely and confusedly he was troubled by it ; feeling as if he had even himself been concerned in something deep and dim . He had allowed for depths , but these were greater : and it was as if , oppressively - indeed absurdly - he was responsible for what they had now thrown up to the surface . It was - through something ancient and cold in it - what he would have called the real thing . In short his hostess 's news , though he could n't have explained why , was a sensible shock , and his oppression a weight he felt he must somehow or other immediately get rid of . There were too many connexions missing to make it tolerable he should do anything else . He was prepared to suffer - before his own inner tribunal - for Chad ; he was prepared to suffer even for Madame de Vionnet . But he was n't prepared to suffer for the little girl So now having said the proper thing , he wanted to get away . She held him an instant , however , with another appeal . "
138920	138921	138913	138913	I	0	" "
138927	138945	138946	138946	Our	1941	" But he called it to himself , even as he spoke , his biggest insincerity yet . "
138954	138955	138956	138956	Mine	1942	" "
138958	138966	138956	138956	Mine	1942	" Oh he could dismiss that too ! "
138973	138974	138967	138967	I	0	" "
139037	139062	139032	139032	you	1940	" Thus she could talk to him of what , of her innermost life - for that was what it came to - he must "
139064	139138	139032	139032	you	1940	" ; thus she could extraordinarily speak as if in such an affair his being satisfied had an importance . It was all a wonder and made the whole case larger . He had struck himself at the hotel , before Sarah and Waymarsh , as being in her boat ; but where on earth was he now ? This question was in the air till her own lips quenched it with another . "
139157	139164	139166	139166	you	1940	" He wondered what he supposed . "
139173	139174	139166	139166	you	1940	" "
139184	139205	139206	139206	He	1944	" It flashed for Strether the next moment a finer light , and the light deepened as she went on . "
139219	139224	139206	139206	He	1944	" It deepened indeed . "
139232	139233	139206	139206	He	1944	" "
139238	139242	139234	139234	You	1940	" she said , "
139256	139266	139267	139267	I	0	" He waited a moment - it all came . "
139273	139281	139270	139270	I	0	" He felt he really did see . "
139321	139471	139315	139315	he	1944	" Her face , with what he had by this time grasped , told him more than her words ; whether something had come into it , or whether he only read clearer , her whole story - what at least he then took for such - reached out to him from it . With the initiative she now attributed to Chad it all made a sense , and this sense - a light , a lead , was what had abruptly risen before him . He wanted , once more , to get off with these things ; which was at last made easy , a servant having , for his assistance , on hearing voices in the hall , just come forward . All that Strether had made out was , while the man opened the door and impersonally waited , summed up in his last word . "
139486	139487	139480	139480	Chad	111	" "
139494	139495	139480	139480	Chad	111	" "
139506	139507	139497	139497	I	0	" "
139521	139536	139517	139517	You	0	" She had finally given him her hand , which he held a moment . "
139544	139545	139539	139539	I	0	" "
139548	140005	139539	139539	I	0	" said Madame de Vionnet : a remark that was indeed - with the refined disguised suppressed passion of her face - what he most carried away . II So far as a direct approach was concerned Sarah had neglected him , for the week now about to end , with a civil consistency of chill that , giving him a higher idea of her social resource , threw him back on the general reflexion that a woman could always be amazing . It indeed helped a little to console him that he felt sure she had for the same period also left Chad 's curiosity hanging ; though on the other hand , for his personal relief , Chad could at least go through the various motions - and he made them extraordinarily numerous - of seeing she had a good time . There was n't a motion on which , in her presence , poor Strether could so much as venture , and all he could do when he was out of it was to walk over for a talk with Maria . He walked over of course much less than usual , but he found a special compensation in a certain half - hour during which , toward the close of a crowded empty expensive day , his several companions seemed to him so disposed of as to give his forms and usages a rest . He had been with them in the morning and had nevertheless called on the Pococks in the afternoon ; but their whole group , he then found , had dispersed after a fashion of which it would amuse Miss Gostrey to hear . He was sorry again , gratefully sorry she was so out of it - she who had really put him in ; but she had fortunately always her appetite for news . The pure flame of the disinterested burned in her cave of treasures as a lamp in a Byzantine vault . It was just now , as happened , that for so fine a sense as hers a near view would have begun to pay . Within three days , precisely , the situation on which he was to report had shown signs of an equilibrium ; the effect of his look in at the hotel was to confirm this appearance . If the equilibrium might only prevail ! Sarah was out with Waymarsh , Mamie was out with Chad , and Jim was out alone . Later on indeed he himself was booked to Jim , was to take him that evening to the Varieties - which Strether was careful to pronounce as Jim pronounced them . Miss Gostrey drank it in . "
140016	140017	140012	140013	the others	544	" "
140033	140037	140025	140025	Waymarsh	96	" She wondered . "
140052	140053	140045	140045	They	544	" "
140082	140088	140075	140075	I	0	" Then as she waited : "
140092	140107	140075	140075	I	0	" It made her stare a moment longer , then laugh almost to extravagance . "
140115	140116	140110	140111	no one	765	" "
140120	140128	140118	140118	ME	0	" - he only wanted to understand . "

140331	140337	140338	140338	Mamie	97	" said Strether with emphasis , "
140346	140350	140342	140342	She	97	" She wondered . "
140361	140362	140354	140354	she	1960	" "
140374	140375	140370	140370	I	0	" "
140392	140402	140403	140403	She	1960	" On which as he said nothing she continued : "

140449	140454	140456	140456	she	1960	" he wound up , "

140469	140474	140462	140462	You	0	" Miss Gostrey laughed , "
140487	140491	140493	140493	himself	1963	" she asked , "

140517	140530	140531	140531	They	1964	" he declared with a sudden strange sound of wistfulness and envy . "
140537	140538	140539	140539	Happy	155	" "
140541	140555	140539	140539	Happy	155	" - it appeared , with their various difficulties , to surprise her . "
140571	140575	140577	140577	your	0	" She demurred . "
140584	140605	140577	140577	your	0	" He had a laugh at his tribute to the ideal , but he explained after a moment his impression . "

140635	140643	140633	140633	you	0	" she asked by way of cheer , "

140736	140742	140730	140730	I.	0	" he again amusedly sighed , "

140787	140792	140785	140785	She	126	" Strether fully assented : "

140864	140932	140933	140933	he	1968	" Yes - for giving in . But I doubt if the idea - as an idea - has ever up to now answered so well for holding out . That 's HER tribute to the ideal - we each have our own . It 's her romance - and it seems to me better on the whole than mine . To have it in Paris too , "
140936	140988	140933	140933	he	1968	" on this classic ground , in this charged infectious air , with so sudden an intensity : well , it 's more than she expected . She has had in short to recognise the breaking out for her of a real affinity - and with everything to enhance the drama . "
140993	140998	140989	140990	Miss Gostrey	99	" Jim for instance ? "
140999	141033	140832	140832	she	126	" Jim . Jim hugely enhances . Jim was made to enhance . And then Mr. Waymarsh . It 's the crowning touch - it supplies the colour . He 's positively separated . "
141034	141048	141049	141050	Miss Gostrey	99	" And she herself unfortunately is n't - that supplies the colour too . "
141059	141065	141066	141066	Strether	82	" Is HE in love ? "
141087	141104	141066	141066	Strether	82	" Will you never tell any one in the world as long as ever you live ? "
141105	141108	140832	140832	she	126	" Never . "
141113	141126	141127	141127	Strether	82	" He thinks Sarah really is . But he has no fear , "
141132	141140	141127	141127	Strether	82	" Of her being affected by it ? "
141141	141172	141066	141066	Strether	82	" Of HIS being . He likes it , but he knows she can hold out . He 's helping her , he 's floating her over , by kindness . "
141179	141228	141173	141173	Maria	97	" Floating her over in champagne ? The kindness of dining her , nose to nose , at the hour when all Paris is crowding to profane delights , and in the - well , in the great temple , as one hears of it , of pleasure ? "
141229	141240	141241	141241	Strether	82	" That 's just IT , for both of them , "
141244	141361	141241	141241	Strether	82	" and all of a supreme innocence . The Parisian place , the feverish hour , the putting before her of a hundred francs ' worth of food and drink , which they 'll scarcely touch - all that 's the dear man 's own romance ; the expensive kind , expensive in francs and centimes , in which he abounds . And the circus afterwards - which is cheaper , but which he 'll find some means of making as dear as possible - that 's also HIS tribute to the ideal . It does for him . He 'll see her through . They wo n't talk of anything worse than you and me . "
141362	141374	141375	141375	she	1970	" Well , we 're bad enough perhaps , thank heaven , "
141378	141394	141375	141375	she	1970	" to upset them ! Mr. Waymarsh at any rate is a hideous old coquette . "
141408	141441	141442	141442	He	1971	" What you do n't appear to know is that Jeanne de Vionnet has become engaged . She 's to marry - it has been definitely arranged - young Monsieur de Montbron . "
141446	141460	141442	141442	He	1971	" Then - if you know it - it 's ' out ' ? "
141461	141475	141476	141476	she	1970	" Do n't I often know things that are NOT out ? However , "
141479	141518	141476	141476	she	1970	" this will be out to - morrow . But I see I 've counted too much on your possible ignorance . You 've been before me , and I do n't make you jump as I hoped . "
141527	141546	141519	141519	He	1971	" You never fail ! I 've HAD my jump . I had it when I first heard . "
141547	141565	141442	141442	He	1971	" Then if you knew why did n't you tell me as soon as you came in ? "
141566	141583	141584	141585	Miss Gostrey	99	" Because I had it from her as a thing not yet to be spoken of . "
141588	141595	141584	141585	Miss Gostrey	99	" From Madame de Vionnet herself ? "
141596	141621	141442	141442	He	1971	" As a probability - not quite a certainty : a good cause in which Chad has been working . So I 've waited . "
141622	141629	141630	141630	she	1970	" You need wait no longer , "
141633	141675	141630	141630	she	1970	" It reached me yesterday - roundabout and accidental , but by a person who had had it from one of the young man 's own people - as a thing quite settled . I was only keeping it for you . "
141676	141686	141687	141687	She	1970	" You thought Chad would n't have told me ? "
141690	141698	141687	141687	She	1970	" Well , if he has n't - "
141699	141721	141442	141442	He	1971	" He has n't . And yet the thing appears to have been practically his doing . So there we are . "
141722	141727	141728	141728	Maria	97	" There we are ! "
141732	141742	141743	141743	he	1972	" That 's why I jumped . I jumped , "
141748	141774	141743	141743	he	1972	" because it means , this disposition of the daughter , that there 's now nothing else : nothing else but him and the mother . "
141775	141781	141442	141442	He	1971	" Still - it simplifies . "
141782	141785	141787	141787	he	1972	" It simplifies "
141791	141819	141787	141787	he	1972	" But that 's precisely where we are . It marks a stage in his relation . The act is his answer to Mrs. Newsome 's demonstration . "
141820	141824	141825	141825	Maria	97	" It tells , "
141828	141832	141825	141825	Maria	97	" the worst ? "
141833	141837	141787	141787	he	1972	" The worst . "
141838	141850	141787	141787	he	1972	" But is the worst what he wants Sarah to know ? "
141851	141859	141825	141825	Maria	97	" He does n't care for Sarah . "
141869	141878	141862	141863	Miss Gostrey	99	" You mean she has already dished herself ? "
141908	141944	141787	141787	he	1972	" He wants his good friend to know the best . I mean the measure of his attachment . She asked for a sign , and he thought of that one . There it is . "
141945	141952	141953	141953	Strether	82	" A concession to her jealousy ? "
141957	141975	141953	141953	Strether	82	" Yes - call it that . Make it lurid - for that makes my problem richer . "
141976	142048	141787	141787	he	1972	" Certainly , let us have it lurid - for I quite agree with you that we want none of our problems poor . But let us also have it clear . Can he , in the midst of such a preoccupation , or on the heels of it , have seriously cared for Jeanne ? - cared , I mean , as a young man at liberty would have cared ? "
142056	142077	142051	142051	Strether	82	" I think he can have thought it would be charming if he COULD care . It would be nicer . "
142078	142087	141787	141787	he	1972	" Nicer than being tied up to Marie ? "
142088	142119	142121	142121	Strether	82	" Yes - than the discomfort of an attachment to a person he can never hope , short of a catastrophe , to marry . And he was quite right , "
142123	142233	142234	142234	he	82	" It would certainly have been nicer . Even when a thing 's already nice there mostly is some other thing that would have been nicer - or as to which we wonder if it would n't . But his question was all the same a dream . He COULDn't care in that way . He IS tied up to Marie . The relation is too special and has gone too far . It 's the very basis , and his recent lively contribution toward establishing Jeanne in life has been his definite and final acknowledgement to Madame de Vionnet that he has ceased squirming . I doubt meanwhile , "
142238	142248	142234	142234	he	82	" if Sarah has at all directly attacked him . "
142253	142271	142249	142250	His companion	388	" But wo n't he wish for his own satisfaction to make his ground good to her ? "
142272	142295	142297	142297	he	82	" No - he 'll leave it to me , he 'll leave everything to me . I ' sort of ' feel "
142302	142333	142297	142297	he	82	" that the whole thing will come upon me . Yes , I shall have every inch and every ounce of it . I shall be USED for it - ! "
142349	142358	142343	142343	he	82	" To the last drop of my blood . "
142366	142385	142359	142359	Maria	97	" Ah you 'll please keep a drop for ME . I shall have a use for it ! "
142406	142422	142395	142395	She	97	" Mrs. Pocock , with her brother , is trusting only to her general charm ? "
142423	142429	142504	142504	Strether	82	" So it would seem . "
142430	142438	142395	142395	She	97	" And the charm 's not working ? "
142446	142465	142441	142441	Strether	82	" She 's sounding the note of home - which is the very best thing she can do . "
142466	142474	142504	142504	Strether	82	" The best for Madame de Vionnet ? "
142475	142490	142504	142504	Strether	82	" The best for home itself . The natural one ; the right one . "
142491	142494	142495	142495	Maria	97	" Right , "
142498	142503	142495	142495	Maria	97	" when it fails ? "
142509	142522	142523	142523	She	97	" The difficulty 's Jim . Jim 's the note of home . "
142526	142536	142523	142523	She	97	" Ah surely not the note of Mrs. Newsome . "
142543	142588	142589	142589	Maria	97	" The note of the home for which Mrs. Newsome wants him - the home of the business . Jim stands , with his little legs apart , at the door of THAT tent ; and Jim is , frankly speaking , extremely awful . "
142592	142607	142589	142589	Maria	97	" And you in , you poor thing , for your evening with him ? "
142608	142617	142618	142618	Strether	82	" Oh he 's all right for ME ! "
142621	142649	142618	142618	Strether	82	" Any one 's good enough for ME . But Sarah should n't , all the same , have brought him . She does n't appreciate him . "
142660	142673	142650	142651	His friend	259	" Does n't know , you mean , how bad he is ? "
142681	142685	142676	142676	his	82	" Not really . "
142689	142696	142676	142676	his	82	" Then does n't Mrs. Newsome ? "
142705	142715	142716	142716	Maria	97	" Well , no - since you ask me . "
142721	142726	142716	142716	Maria	97	" Not really either ? "
142727	142738	142716	142716	Maria	97	" Not at all . She rates him rather high . "
142750	142771	142745	142745	he	82	" Well , he IS good too , in his way . It depends on what you want him for . "
142800	142806	142807	142807	she	99	" It suits my book , "
142810	142824	142825	142825	she	99	" that he should be impossible ; and it suits it still better , "
142830	142840	142825	142825	she	99	" that Mrs. Newsome does n't know he is . "
142861	142871	142854	142854	he	82	" I 'll tell you who does really know . "
142872	142878	142825	142825	she	99	" Mr. Waymarsh ? Never ! "
142879	142901	142903	142903	he	82	" Never indeed . I 'm not ALWAYS thinking of Mr. Waymarsh ; in fact I find now I never am . "
142917	142920	142903	142903	he	82	" Mamie . "
142921	142926	142825	142825	she	99	" His own sister ? "
142935	142942	142825	142825	she	99	" What good will that do ? "
142943	142956	142903	142903	he	82	" None perhaps . But there - as usual - we are ! "
143124	143127	143129	143129	Chad	111	" Maitres d'Autrefois "
144184	144187	144189	144189	he	82	" good friend "
144448	144451	144443	144444	a child	2812	" bud , "
144890	144899	144883	144883	she	759	" Oh I thought you were Mr. Bilham ! "
145190	145193	145196	145196	she	3696	" funny . "
145347	145350	145318	145318	she	3696	" receiving , "
145395	145398	145391	145391	she	3696	" meet . "
146318	146322	146316	146316	she	3696	" heard so much "
146337	146341	146334	146334	she	3696	" dying to see "
146605	146608	146609	146609	she	3696	" Nothing , "
146614	146645	146609	146609	she	3696	" ought ever to happen to her - she 's so awfully right as she is . Another touch will spoil her - so she ought n't to BE touched . "
146646	146655	146656	146656	Strether	82	" Ah but things , here in Paris , "
146659	146666	146609	146609	she	3696	" do happen to little girls . "
146679	146687	146656	146656	Strether	82	" Have n't you found that yourself ? "
146688	146715	146716	146716	Mamie	97	" That things happen - ? Oh I 'm not a little girl . I 'm a big battered blowsy one . I do n't care , "
146719	146723	146716	146716	Mamie	97	" WHAT happens . "
146818	146837	146806	146806	he	82	" But that Mademoiselle de Vionnet is to be married - I suppose you 've heard of THAT . "
146849	146871	146841	146841	he	82	" Dear , yes ; the gentleman was there : Monsieur de Montbron , whom Madame de Vionnet presented to us . "
146872	146878	146879	146879	Mamie	97	" And was he nice ? "
146889	146900	146884	146884	her	97	" Any man 's nice when he 's in love . "
146906	146920	146903	146903	Strether	82	" But is Monsieur de Montbron in love - already - with YOU ? "
146921	146980	146981	146981	Strether	82	" Oh that 's not necessary - it 's so much better he should be so with HER : which , thank goodness , I lost no time in discovering for myself . He 's perfectly gone - and I could n't have borne it for her if he had n't been . She 's just too sweet . "
146984	146992	146981	146981	Strether	82	" And through being in love too ? "
147009	147020	147003	147003	Mamie	97	" She does n't know if she is or not . "
147028	147034	147023	147023	him	82	" Oh but YOU do ! "
147044	147052	147035	147035	She	97	" Oh yes , I know everything . "
147099	147115	147121	147121	they	2076	" Know that poor little Jeanne does n't know what 's the matter with her ? "
147205	147246	147186	147186	she	97	" If I see a little more of her , as I hope I shall , I think she 'll like me enough - for she seemed to like me to - day - to want me to tell her . "
147247	147252	147161	147161	she	97	" And SHALL you ? "
147253	147283	147285	147285	Mamie	97	" Perfectly . I shall tell her the matter with her is that she wants only too much to do right . To do right for her , naturally , "
147287	147292	147285	147285	Mamie	97	" is to please . "
147293	147301	147186	147186	she	97	" Her mother , do you mean ? "
147302	147307	147161	147161	she	97	" Her mother first . "
147311	147315	147161	147161	she	97	" And then ? "
147316	147326	147161	147161	she	97	" Well , ' then ' - Mr. Newsome . "
147341	147349	147333	147333	him	82	" And last only Monsieur de Montbron ? "
147350	147353	147355	147355	she	97	" Last only "
147366	147378	147363	147363	Strether	82	" So that every one after all then will be suited ? "
147414	147427	147428	147428	It	2080	" I think I can speak for myself . I shall be . "
147541	147548	147530	147530	He	82	" Splendid , splendid , splendid ! "
148339	148342	148365	148365	his	4203	" pace . "
149272	149302	149264	149264	he	82	" You who sat where you could see her , what does she make of it all ? By which I mean on what terms does she take it ? "
149303	149326	149615	149615	Strether	82	" Oh she takes it , I judge , as proving that the claim of his family is more than ever justified . "
149327	149340	149264	149264	he	82	" She is n't then pleased with what he has to show ? "
149341	149397	149615	149615	Strether	82	" On the contrary ; she 's pleased with it as with his capacity to do this kind of thing - more than she has been pleased with anything for a long time . But she wants him to show it THERE . He has no right to waste it on the likes of us . "
149401	149412	149398	149398	Strether	82	" She wants him to move the whole thing over ? "
149413	149497	149264	149264	he	82	" The whole thing - with an important exception . Everything he has ' picked up ' - and the way he knows how . She sees no difficulty in that . She 'd run the show herself , and she 'll make the handsome concession that Woollett would be on the whole in some ways the better for it . Not that it would n't be also in some ways the better for Woollett . The people there are just as good . "
149498	149524	149525	149525	Strether	82	" Just as good as you and these others ? Ah that may be . But such an occasion as this , whether or no , "
149528	149543	149525	149525	Strether	82	" is n't the people . It 's what has made the people possible . "
149544	149548	149549	149550	his friend	259	" Well then , "
149553	149614	149549	149550	his friend	259	" there you are ; I give you my impression for what it 's worth . Mrs. Pocock has SEEN , and that 's to - night how she sits there . If you were to have a glimpse of her face you 'd understand me . She has made up her mind - to the sound of expensive music . "
149621	149631	149615	149615	Strether	82	" Ah then I shall have news of her . "
149632	149649	149650	149651	little Bilham	83	" I do n't want to frighten you , but I think that likely . However , "
149654	149670	149650	149651	little Bilham	83	" if I 'm of the least use to you to hold on by - ! "
149671	149679	149650	149651	little Bilham	83	" You 're not of the least ! "
149693	149701	149682	149682	Strether	82	" No one 's of the least . "
149721	149741	149742	149742	he	82	" I must meet my fate alone , and I SHALL - oh you 'll see ! And yet , "
149748	149760	149762	149762	he	82	" you CAN help me too . You once said to me "
149767	149807	149809	149809	he	82	" that you held Chad should marry . I did n't see then so well as I know now that you meant he should marry Miss Pocock . Do you still consider that he should ? Because if you do "
149814	149831	149809	149809	he	82	" I want you immediately to change your mind . You can help me that way . "
149832	149842	149762	149762	he	82	" Help you by thinking he should NOT marry ? "
149843	149851	149809	149809	he	82	" Not marry at all events Mamie . "
149852	149857	149809	149809	he	82	" And who then ? "
149858	149861	149762	149762	he	82	" Ah , "
149865	149887	149862	149862	Strether	82	" that I 'm not obliged to say . But Madame de Vionnet - I suggest - when he can . ' "
149890	149898	149809	149809	he	82	" said little Bilham with some sharpness . "
149933	149939	149930	149930	I	0	" Little Bilham was amused . "
149947	149948	149930	149930	I	0	" "
149959	149966	149968	149968	you	2131	" The young man weighed it . "
149975	149976	149968	149968	you	2131	" "
149979	149986	149968	149968	you	2131	" said Strether , thus challenged , "
150012	150017	150018	150018	I	0	" he went on , "
150028	150034	150026	150026	yourself	2131	" Little Bilham laughed out . "
150059	150060	150049	150049	you	0	" "
150065	150073	150049	150049	you	0	" Well , Strether easily confessed it . "
150145	150159	150141	150141	she	100	" Little Bilham stared as a delicate appetite stares at an overheaped plate . "
150167	150175	150162	150162	I	0	" It just made his friend impatient . "
150181	150182	150179	150179	you	0	" "
150193	150194	150189	150189	she	100	" "
150247	150256	150243	150243	you	0	" Little Bilham after a moment found it . "
150270	150271	150275	150275	I	0	" "
150298	150307	150308	150308	you	0	" - Strether encouraged his fancy 's flight - "
150333	150345	150315	150315	you	0	" His companion paid his ingenuity the deference of a pause . "
150370	150377	150359	150359	I	0	" the young man honourably declared . "
150386	150397	150383	150383	you	0	" And Strether , charmed , held him the faster . "
150409	150413	150400	150400	you	0	" he continued , "
150435	150450	150433	150433	I	0	" - and our friend spoke now with a yearning that was really earnest - "
150458	150459	150433	150433	I	0	" "
150470	150471	150433	150433	I	0	" "
150530	150535	150527	150527	I	0	" Strether went on , "
150609	150616	150664	150664	You	0	" And then he further explained . "
150641	150663	150664	150664	You	0	" The young man , at this , bounced about , and it brought them face to face in admitted amusement . "
150675	150676	150664	150664	You	0	" "
150679	150683	150664	150664	You	0	" Strether debated - "
150707	150708	150684	150684	HE	111	" "
150713	150727	150684	150684	HE	111	" - and little Bilham 's concurrence was in itself a lively comment . "
150735	150739	150732	150732	I	0	" he continued , "
150750	150751	150740	150740	you	0	" "
150829	150836	150837	150837	YOU	0	" But little Bilham still questioned . "
150854	150875	150852	150852	I	0	" Poor Strether thought it over , but was obliged of course to admit that his demonstration did superficially fail . "
150906	150911	150914	150914	you	0	" Little Bilham wondered . "
150919	150920	150914	150914	you	0	" "
150934	151038	150928	150928	I	0	" He had spoken in the tone of talk for talk 's sake , and yet with an obscure truth lurking in the loose folds ; a circumstance presently not without its effect on his young friend . Little Bilham 's eyes rested on him a moment with some intensity ; then suddenly , as if everything had cleared up , he gave a happy laugh . It seemed to say that if pretending , or even trying , or still even hoping , to be able to care for Mamie would be of use , he was all there for the job . "
151049	151050	150928	150928	I	0	" "
151053	151057	150928	150928	I	0	" Strether smiled , "
151079	151084	151074	151074	me	0	" he went on , "
151151	151152	151155	151155	Chad	111	" "
151159	151164	151155	151155	Chad	111	" said little Bilham , "
151183	151184	151167	151170	the next young man	2147	" "
151209	151213	151206	151206	you	2147	" Strether asked , "
151219	151230	151215	151215	Chad	111	" And then as this interlocutor seemed at a loss : "
151238	151268	151215	151215	Chad	111	" Little Bilham , at this , met his face with a conscious look - it was as if , more than anything yet , the allusion had penetrated . "
151274	151281	151272	151272	yourself	2147	" Strether lightly shook his head . "
151461	151475	151455	151455	You	2153	" He looked at his young friend hard - then he felt sure . "
151493	151503	151490	151490	you	2153	" Little Bilham after an instant pulled half round . "
151514	151515	151518	151518	she	2145	" "
151607	151626	151627	151627	I	0	" The young man faced this blast ; after which he pulled round the rest of the way . "
151647	151648	151643	151643	she	2145	" "
151660	151661	151643	151643	she	2145	" "
151674	151681	151643	151643	she	2145	" little Bilham loyally went on , "
151707	151708	151643	151643	she	2145	" "
151717	151748	151711	151711	she	2145	" Little Bilham sat staring before him ; then he sprang up as if his friend 's penetration , recurrent and insistent , made him really after all too nervous . "
151763	151768	151769	151769	Chad	111	" he went on , "
151823	151824	151825	151825	Ah	2163	" "
151832	151840	151825	151825	Ah	2163	" Strether also got to his feet . "
151888	151889	151884	151884	her	2145	" "
151896	151897	151898	151898	She	2145	" "
151910	151913	151916	151916	one	2797	" Strether wondered "
151945	151946	151962	151962	she	2169	" "
152015	152016	152011	152013	the general opposite	2171	" "
152023	152029	152020	152020	her	2145	" - Strether weighed it - "
152046	152066	152067	152067	She	2145	" Little Bilham fixed it all a moment , and then with a small headshake that diffused a tenderness : "
152078	152079	152067	152067	She	2145	" "
152081	152088	152067	152067	She	2145	" - his companion saw enough . "
152112	152113	152106	152106	her	2145	" "
152161	152177	152155	152155	she	2145	" Strether quite felt how it all fitted , yet there seemed one loose piece . "
152205	152213	152216	152216	she	2145	" Little Bilham tossed up his chin . "
152240	152241	152242	152242	I	0	" "
152248	152266	152245	152245	I	0	" our friend repeated , charmed by the responsive wisdom he had ended by so richly extracting . "
152277	152278	152269	152275	one of the real and the right	2177	" "
152284	152285	152269	152275	one of the real and the right	2177	" "
152293	152298	152269	152275	one of the real and the right	2177	" Strether went on , "
152311	152312	152303	152303	Chad	111	" "
152344	152357	152332	152332	she	2145	" It hung beautifully together , but with still a loose end . "
152372	152373	152366	152366	he	111	" "
152379	152394	152366	152366	he	111	" Oh little Bilham had for this enquiry the sharpest of all his controls . "
152413	152428	152366	152366	he	111	" Strether could only meet the question with his passive , his receptive pleasure . "
152476	152790	152466	152466	your	2178	" The most he could further say to himself - as his young friend turned away - was that the charge encountered for the moment no renewed denial . Little Bilham , taking his course back to the music , only shook his good - natured ears an instant , in the manner of a terrier who has got wet ; while Strether relapsed into the sense - which had for him in these days most of comfort - that he was free to believe in anything that from hour to hour kept him going . He had positively motions and flutters of this conscious hour - to - hour kind , temporary surrenders to irony , to fancy , frequent instinctive snatches at the growing rose of observation , constantly stronger for him , as he felt , in scent and colour , and in which he could bury his nose even to wantonness . This last resource was offered him , for that matter , in the very form of his next clear perception - the vision of a prompt meeting , in the doorway of the room , between little Bilham and brilliant Miss Barrace , who was entering as Bilham withdrew . She had apparently put him a question , to which he had replied by turning to indicate his late interlocutor ; toward whom , after an interrogation further aided by a resort to that optical machinery which seemed , like her other ornaments , curious and archaic , the genial lady , suggesting more than ever for her fellow guest the old French print , the historic portrait , directed herself with an intention that Strether instantly met . He knew in advance the first note she would sound , and took in as she approached all her need of sounding it . Nothing yet had been so "
152792	152937	152938	152940	All you ladies	2179	" between them as the present occasion ; and it was her special sense of this quality in occasions that she was there , as she was in most places , to feed . That sense had already been so well fed by the situation about them that she had quitted the other room , forsaken the music , dropped out of the play , abandoned , in a word , the stage itself , that she might stand a minute behind the scenes with Strether and so perhaps figure as one of the famous augurs replying , behind the oracle , to the wink of the other . Seated near him presently where little Bilham had sat , she replied in truth to many things ; beginning as soon as he had said to her - what he hoped he said without fatuity - "
152947	152972	152939	152939	you	2179	" She played her long handle , which shifted her observation ; she saw in an instant all the absences that left them free . "
153042	153056	153040	153040	she	99	" With which she again looked about as if Maria might still lurk . "
153060	153075	153040	153040	she	99	" said Strether ; ' she 's only sitting up for me at home . "
153086	153093	153094	153094	he	2182	" Oh , oh , oh ! "
153106	153133	153094	153094	he	2182	" We thought it on the whole better she should n't be present ; and either way of course it 's a terrible worry for her . "
153162	153173	153147	153147	they	211	" Yet she inclines to believe I shall come out . "
153174	153186	153188	153189	Miss Barrace	131	" Oh I incline to believe too you 'll come out ! "
153201	153215	153216	153216	she	131	" Only the question 's about WHERE , is n't it ? However , "
153220	153249	153250	153250	she	131	" if it 's anywhere at all it must be very far on , must n't it ? To do us justice , I think , you know , "
153253	153271	153272	153272	she	131	" we do , among us all , want you rather far on . Yes , yes , "
153280	153290	153272	153272	she	131	" we want you very , VERY far on ! "
153309	153312	153313	153313	he	2182	" Oh , "
153316	153335	153313	153313	he	2182	" it was really her own idea . I should have wished it . But she dreads responsibility . "
153336	153347	153293	153293	she	131	" And is n't that a new thing for her ? "
153348	153366	153367	153368	Miss Barrace	131	" To dread it ? No doubt - no doubt . But her nerve has given way . "
153375	153383	153367	153368	Miss Barrace	131	" She has too much at stake . "
153388	153398	153367	153368	Miss Barrace	131	" Mine , luckily for me , holds out . "
153399	153404	153406	153406	Strether	82	" Luckily for me too "
153412	153464	153406	153406	Strether	82	" My own is n't so firm , MY appetite for responsibility is n't so sharp , as that I have n't felt the very principle of this occasion to be ' the more the merrier . ' If we ARE so merry it 's because Chad has understood so well . "
153465	153471	153473	153474	Miss Barrace	131	" He has understood amazingly , "
153476	153486	153473	153474	Miss Barrace	131	" It 's wonderful - Strether anticipated for her . "
153491	153520	153473	153474	Miss Barrace	131	" she , to meet it , intensified ; so that , face to face over it , they largely and recklessly laughed . But she presently added : "
153546	153547	153611	153611	you	2187	" "
153565	153566	153559	153559	he	2182	" "
153569	153577	153559	153559	he	2182	" - she took him straight up - "
153592	153596	153559	153559	he	2182	" she laughed , "
153630	153646	153625	153625	She	113	" - Miss Barrace embroidered the theme . Strether followed , but scrupulous of justice . "
153659	153660	153649	153653	every one in the place	2188	" "
153683	153702	153736	153736	I	0	" Strether seemed for a moment to look at it ; but it brought him to a sigh . "
153720	153733	153736	153736	I	0	" His companion had a pause that might have been for pity . "
153757	153768	153736	153736	I	0	" She remained pensive as if with the same compunction . "
153777	153786	153736	153736	I	0	" Then again for the fun of it : "
153791	153792	153793	153793	She	113	" "
153797	153807	153793	153793	She	113	" - he echoed it in the same spirit . "
153813	153818	153793	153793	She	113	" he went on , "
153880	153890	153877	153877	I	0	" She focussed him with her clink of chains . "
153894	153901	153877	153877	I	0	" she breathed ever so kindly . "
153906	153907	153908	153908	She	113	" "
153916	153920	153908	153908	She	113	" she mused ; "
153929	153930	153908	153908	She	113	" "
153938	153943	153944	153944	Waymarsh	96	" Strether ruefully laughed . "
153948	153953	153944	153944	Waymarsh	96	" he then asked , "
153960	153961	153944	153944	Waymarsh	96	" "
153985	153989	153993	153993	you	2190	" Strether wondered . "
153996	153997	153993	153993	you	2190	" "
154006	154007	153999	153999	I	0	" "
154015	154016	153993	153993	you	2190	" "
154029	154034	154035	154035	I	0	" she lightly wailed , "
154051	154052	154049	154049	you	0	" "
154055	154061	154049	154049	you	0	" - he was magnanimous - "
154081	154088	154078	154078	MY	0	" She was silent a little . "
154107	154108	154102	154102	his	96	" "
154112	154119	154102	154102	his	96	" said Strether good - naturedly , "
154126	154127	154122	154122	he	96	" "
154135	154136	154128	154128	He	96	" "
154163	154164	154157	154157	you	2190	" "
154180	154185	154186	154186	I	0	" Miss Barrace smiled . "
154221	154233	154214	154215	Mrs. Pocock	113	" And then , as he still seemed slightly at sea : "
154260	154275	154248	154248	her	113	" Strether saw , but as if his path was still strewn with surprises . "
154289	154298	154284	154284	she	113	" She was amused at his momentary muddle . "
154321	154326	154327	154327	Strether	82	" Oh her joy ! "
154331	154363	154327	154327	Strether	82	" Well , she thinks she has had her own way . And what 's to - night for her but a kind of apotheosis ? Her frock 's really good . "
154364	154379	154380	154380	Strether	82	" Good enough to go to heaven in ? For after a real apotheosis , "
154384	154400	154380	154380	Strether	82	" there 's nothing BUT heaven . For Sarah there 's only to - morrow . "
154401	154415	154327	154327	Strether	82	" And you mean that she wo n't find to - morrow heavenly ? "
154416	154491	154492	154492	He	82	" Well , I mean that I somehow feel to - night - on her behalf - too good to be true . She has had her cake ; that is she 's in the act now of having it , of swallowing the largest and sweetest piece . There wo n't be another left for her . Certainly I have n't one . It can only , at the best , be Chad . "
154504	154530	154380	154380	Strether	82	" He may have one , as it were , up his sleeve ; yet it 's borne in upon me that if he had - "
154531	154535	154537	154537	she	2197	" He would n't "
154541	154583	154584	154584	she	2197	" have taken all THIS trouble ? I dare say not , and , if I may be quite free and dreadful , I very much hope he wo n't take any more . Of course I wo n't pretend now , "
154587	154598	154584	154584	she	2197	" not to know what it 's a question of . "
154599	154607	154609	154609	Strether	82	" Oh every one must know now , "
154613	154640	154609	154609	Strether	82	" and it 's strange enough and funny enough that one should feel everybody here at this very moment to be knowing and watching and waiting . "
154641	154650	154651	154652	Miss Barrace	131	" Yes - is n't it indeed funny ? "
154658	154668	154651	154652	Miss Barrace	131	" That 's the way we ARE in Paris . "
154681	154691	154692	154692	she	2197	" It 's wonderful ! But , you know , "
154695	154753	154692	154692	she	2197	" it all depends on you . I do n't want to turn the knife in your vitals , but that 's naturally what you just now meant by our all being on top of you . We know you as the hero of the drama , and we 're gathered to see what you 'll do . "
154767	154796	154754	154754	Strether	82	" I think that must be why the hero has taken refuge in this corner . He 's scared at his heroism - he shrinks from his part . "
154797	154812	154813	154814	Miss Barrace	131	" Ah but we nevertheless believe he 'll play it . That 's why , "
154819	154838	154813	154814	Miss Barrace	131	" we take such an interest in you . We feel you 'll come up to the scratch . "
154851	154859	154842	154842	he	82	" Do n't let him do it . "
154860	154867	154813	154814	Miss Barrace	131	" Do n't let Chad go ? "
154868	154879	154882	154882	she	2197	" Yes , keep hold of him . With all this "
154888	154903	154882	154882	she	2197	" he has done enough . We love him here - he 's charming . "
154904	154909	154911	154911	Strether	82	" It 's beautiful , "
154913	154924	154911	154911	Strether	82	" the way you all can simplify when you will . "
154933	154946	154926	154926	she	2197	" It 's nothing to the way you will when you must . "
154991	155037	154967	154967	He	82	" There positively is n't a sign of a hero to - night ; the hero 's dodging and shirking , the hero 's ashamed . Therefore , you know , I think , what you must all REALLY be occupied with is the heroine . "
155044	155048	155038	155039	Miss Barrace	131	" The heroine ? "
155049	155058	155060	155060	Strether	82	" The heroine . I 've treated her , "
155062	155072	155073	155073	he	82	" not a bit like a hero . Oh , "
155076	155084	155073	155073	he	82	" I do n't do it well ! "
155090	155098	155085	155085	She	131	" You do it as you can . "
155105	155112	155114	155114	he	82	" I think she 's satisfied . "
155118	155133	155114	155114	he	82	" I have n't been near her . I have n't looked at her . "
155134	155144	155145	155145	He	82	" Ah then you 've lost a good deal ! "
155151	155159	155145	155145	He	82	" She 's more wonderful than ever ? "
155160	155168	155169	155169	Strether	82	" Than ever . With Mr. Pocock . "
155172	155180	155169	155169	Strether	82	" Madame de Vionnet - with Jim ? "
155181	155191	155192	155193	Miss Barrace	131	" Madame de Vionnet - with ' Jim . ' "
155197	155206	155192	155193	Miss Barrace	131	" And what 's she doing with him ? "
155207	155214	155215	155215	Strether	82	" Ah you must ask HIM ! "
155224	155233	155215	155215	Strether	82	" It WILL be amusing to do so . "
155240	155248	155235	155235	he	82	" But she must have some idea . "
155249	155267	155269	155270	Miss Barrace	131	" Of course she has - she has twenty ideas . She has in the first place , "
155280	155294	155269	155270	Miss Barrace	131	" that of doing her part . Her part is to help YOU . "
155326	155336	155337	155337	Strether	82	" Yes ; how much more she does it , "
155341	155347	155337	155337	Strether	82	" than I help HER ! "
155384	155389	155376	155376	he	82	" SHE has courage . "
155390	155396	155397	155398	Miss Barrace	131	" Ah she has courage ! "
155428	155435	155376	155376	he	82	" How much she must care ! "
155436	155454	155455	155456	Miss Barrace	131	" Ah there it is . She does care . But it is n't , is it , "
155460	155472	155455	155456	Miss Barrace	131	" as if you had ever had any doubt of that ? "
155486	155496	155473	155473	Strether	82	" Why of course it 's the whole point . "
155497	155500	155501	155502	Miss Barrace	131	" Voila ! "
155505	155513	155514	155514	Strether	82	" It 's why one came out , "
155518	155533	155535	155535	he	82	" And it 's why one has stayed so long . And it 's also "
155538	155553	155514	155514	Strether	82	" why one 's going home . It 's why , it 's why - "
155554	155560	155561	155561	she	131	" It 's why everything ! "
155564	155624	155625	155625	Strether	82	" It 's why she might be to - night - for all she looks and shows , and for all your friend ' Jim ' does - about twenty years old . That 's another of her ideas ; to be for him , and to be quite easily and charmingly , as young as a little girl . "
155631	155641	155625	155625	Strether	82	" ' For him ' ? For Chad - ? "
155642	155664	155561	155561	she	131	" For Chad , in a manner , naturally , always . But in particular to - night for Mr. Pocock . "
155673	155694	155625	155625	Strether	82	" Yes , it IS of a bravery But that 's what she has : her high sense of duty . "
155703	155716	155625	155625	Strether	82	" When Mr. Newsome has his hands so embarrassed with his sister - "
155717	155723	155725	155725	Strether	82	" It 's quite the least "
155730	155752	155725	155725	Strether	82	" that she should take his sister 's husband ? Certainly - quite the least . So she has taken him . "
155753	155759	155625	155625	Strether	82	" She has taken him . "
155773	155779	155763	155764	Miss Barrace	131	" It must be funny . "
155780	155786	155725	155725	Strether	82	" Oh it IS funny . "
155818	155821	155812	155812	Strether	82	" Ah ! "
156979	157102	156930	156930	Strether	82	" Mrs. Pocock , whom I left a quarter of an hour ago at her hotel , has asked me to mention to you that she would like to find you at home here in about another hour . She wants to see you ; she has something to say - or considers , I believe , that you may have : so that I asked her myself why she should n't come right round . She has n't BEEN round yet - to see our place ; and I took upon myself to say that I was sure you 'd be glad to have her . The thing 's therefore , you see , to keep right here till she comes . "
157205	157216	157217	157217	Waymarsh	96	" The thing 's for YOU to keep here too ? "
157362	157367	157369	157369	Waymarsh	96	" I told her , "
157371	157389	157390	157390	Strether	82	" that it would have been a bright idea if she had only carried it out before . "
157401	157433	157390	157390	Strether	82	" But why HASn't she carried it out before ? She has seen me every day - she had only to name her hour . I 've been waiting and waiting . "
157434	157450	157390	157390	Strether	82	" Well , I told her you had . And she has been waiting too . "
157616	157621	157622	157622	he	82	" At any rate , "
157631	157697	157622	157622	he	82	" Considering how many pieces had to fit themselves , it all fell , in Strether 's brain , into a close rapid order . He saw on the spot what had happened , and what probably would yet ; and it was all funny enough . It was perhaps just this freedom of appreciation that wound him up to his flare of high spirits . "
157709	157710	157700	157700	she	113	" "
157741	158002	157711	157711	She	113	" This was spoken by Waymarsh with much gravity of admonition , and as Strether stood there he knew he had but to make a movement to take the attitude of a man gracefully receiving a present . The present was that of the opportunity dear old Waymarsh had flattered himself he had divined in him the slight soreness of not having yet thoroughly enjoyed ; so he had brought it to him thus , as on a little silver breakfast - tray , familiarly though delicately - without oppressive pomp ; and he was to bend and smile and acknowledge , was to take and use and be grateful . He was not - that was the beauty of it - to be asked to deflect too much from his dignity . No wonder the old boy bloomed in this bland air of his own distillation . Strether felt for a moment as if Sarah were actually walking up and down outside . Was n't she hanging about the porte - cochere while her friend thus summarily opened a way ? Strether would meet her but to take it , and everything would be for the best in the best of possible worlds . He had never so much known what any one meant as , in the light of this demonstration , he knew what Mrs. Newsome did . It had reached Waymarsh from Sarah , but it had reached Sarah from her mother , and there was no break in the chain by which it reached HIM . "
158008	158030	158031	158031	Waymarsh	96	" he asked after a minute - ' so suddenly to determine her ? Has she heard anything unexpected from home ? "
158048	158053	158031	158031	Waymarsh	96	" ' Unexpected ' ? "
158068	158074	158064	158064	he	96	" We 're leaving Paris . "
158075	158082	158083	158083	Waymarsh	96	" Leaving ? That IS sudden . "
158089	158116	158083	158083	Waymarsh	96	" Less so than it may seem . The purpose of Mrs. Pocock 's visit is to explain to you in fact that it 's NOT . "
158177	158200	158170	158170	he	82	" I shall take great pleasure , I assure you , in any explanation . I shall be delighted to receive Sarah . "
158360	158364	158350	158350	he	82	" Quit it ! "
158502	158586	158587	158587	He	96	" I 'm not leaving for the United States direct . Mr. and Mrs. Pocock and Miss Mamie are thinking of a little trip before their own return , and we 've been talking for some days past of our joining forces . We 've settled it that we do join and that we sail together the end of next month . But we start to - morrow for Switzerland . Mrs. Pocock wants some scenery . She has n't had much yet . "
158613	158629	158591	158591	his	96	" Is what Mrs. Newsome had cabled her daughter an injunction to break off short ? "
158643	158653	158638	158638	its	2238	" I know nothing about Mrs. Newsome 's cables . "
158916	158922	158923	158923	he	82	" You do n't know , "
158926	158947	158923	158923	he	82	" whether Sarah has been directed from home to try me on the matter of my also going to Switzerland ? "
158948	158952	158954	158954	Waymarsh	96	" I know , "
158960	158985	158954	158954	Waymarsh	96	" nothing whatever about her private affairs ; though I believe her to be acting in conformity with things that have my highest respect . "
159076	159096	159097	159097	he	82	" Mrs Pocock will probably be ready herself to answer any enquiry you may put to her . But , "
159100	159104	159097	159097	he	82	" BUT - ! "
159110	159121	159097	159097	he	82	" But what ? Do n't put her too many ? "
159145	159156	159097	159097	he	82	" Do n't do anything you 'll be sorry for . "
159283	159299	159279	159279	he	82	" Of course I need n't assure you I hope you 'll come with us . "
159370	159474	159475	159475	he	2251	" I shall see you again of course before you go ; but I 'm meanwhile much obliged to you for arranging so conveniently for what you 've told me . I shall walk up and down in the court there - dear little old court which we 've each bepaced so , this last couple of months , to the tune of our flights and our drops , our hesitations and our plunges : I shall hang about there , all impatience and excitement , please let Sarah know , till she graciously presents herself . Leave me with her without fear , "
159478	159593	159475	159475	he	2251	" I assure you I sha n't hurt her . I do n't think either she 'll hurt ME : I 'm in a situation in which damage was some time ago discounted . Besides , THAT is n't what worries you - but do n't , do n't explain ! We 're all right as we are : which was the degree of success our adventure was pledged to for each of us . We were n't , it seemed , all right as we were before ; and we 've got over the ground , all things considered , quickly . I hope you 'll have a lovely time in the Alps . "
159607	159619	159594	159594	Waymarsh	96	" I do n't know as I OUGHT really to go . "
159656	159706	159650	159650	he	82	" LET yourself , on the contrary , go - in all agreeable directions . These are precious hours - at our age they may n't recur . Do n't have it to say to yourself at Milrose , next winter , that you had n't courage for them . "
159715	159722	159650	159650	he	82	" Live up to Mrs. Pocock . "
159723	159729	159650	159650	he	82	" Live up to her ? "
159730	159739	159740	159740	Waymarsh	96	" You 're a great help to her . "
159764	159773	159650	159650	he	82	" It 's more then than you are . "
159774	159786	159788	159788	Strether	82	" That 's exactly your own chance and advantage . Besides , "
159790	159805	159788	159788	Strether	82	" I do in my way contribute . I know what I 'm about . "
159840	159850	159824	159824	his	96	" So do I ! See here , Strether . "
159851	159866	159824	159824	his	96	" I know what you 're going to say . ' Quit this ' ? "
159867	159871	159824	159824	his	96	" Quit this ! "
160032	160039	160041	160041	Strether	82	" You yourself alone , dear Sarah "
160046	160072	160041	160041	Strether	82	" have done him , it strikes me , in these three weeks , as much good as all the rest of his time together . "
160089	160092	160041	160041	Strether	82	" funny , "
160830	160854	160886	160886	Strether	82	" He 'll go in a moment if you give him the word - he assures me on his honour he 'll do that "
161164	161174	161175	161175	he	82	" Something has clearly passed between you and Chad , "
161179	161197	161198	161198	he	82	" that I think I ought to know something more about . Does he put it all , "
161201	161205	161175	161175	he	82	" on me ? "
161206	161212	161213	161213	she	113	" Did you come out , "
161216	161224	161213	161213	she	113	" to put it all on HIM ? "
161241	161291	161226	161226	he	82	" Oh it 's all right . Chad I mean 's all right in having said to you - well anything he may have said . I 'll TAKE it all - what he does put on me . Only I must see him before I see you again . "
161301	161312	161296	161296	she	113	" Is it absolutely necessary you should see me again ? "
161313	161328	161296	161296	she	113	" Certainly , if I 'm to give you any definite word about anything . "
161329	161336	161337	161337	she	113	" Is it your idea then , "
161340	161356	161337	161337	she	113	" that I shall keep on meeting you only to be exposed to fresh humiliation ? "
161364	161387	161357	161357	He	2273	" Are your instructions from Mrs. Newsome that you shall , even at the worst , absolutely and irretrievably break with me ? "
161388	161468	161469	161469	She	2274	" My instructions from Mrs. Newsome are , if you please , my affair . You know perfectly what your own were , and you can judge for yourself of what it can do for you to have made what you have of them . You can perfectly see , at any rate , I 'll go so far as to say , that if I wish not to expose myself I must wish still less to expose HER . "
161520	161526	161527	161527	she	2274	" What is your conduct , "
161535	161571	161527	161527	she	2274	" what is your conduct but an outrage to women like US ? I mean your acting as if there can be a doubt - as between us and such another - of his duty ? "
161600	161611	161527	161527	she	2274	" Of course they 're totally different kinds of duty . "
161612	161628	161527	161527	she	2274	" And do you pretend that he has any at all - to such another ? "
161629	161638	161639	161639	He	2275	" Do you mean to Madame de Vionnet ? "
161792	161806	161847	161847	she	2274	" Why when a woman 's at once so charming and so beneficent - "
161807	161844	161847	161847	she	2274	" You can sacrifice mothers and sisters to her without a blush and can make them cross the ocean on purpose to feel the more and take from you the straighter , HOW you do it ? "
161870	161985	161986	161986	he	2275	" I do n't think there 's anything I 've done in any such calculated way as you describe . Everything has come as a sort of indistinguishable part of everything else . Your coming out belonged closely to my having come before you , and my having come was a result of our general state of mind . Our general state of mind had proceeded , on its side , from our queer ignorance , our queer misconceptions and confusions - from which , since then , an inexorable tide of light seems to have floated us into our perhaps still queerer knowledge . Do n't you LIKE your brother as he is , "
161990	162008	161986	161986	he	2275	" and have n't you given your mother an intelligible account of all that that comes to ? "
162205	162213	162214	162214	she	2276	" I leave you to flatter yourself , "
162217	162243	162214	162214	she	2276	" that what you speak of is what YOU'VE beautifully done . When a thing has been already described in such a lovely way - ! "
162261	162274	162245	162245	she	2276	" Do you consider her even an apology for a decent woman ? "
162360	162397	162398	162398	He	2275	" She has struck me from the first as wonderful . I 've been thinking too moreover that , after all , she would probably have represented even for yourself something rather new and rather good . "
162420	162432	162411	162411	her	113	" Rather new ? I hope so with all my heart ! "
162433	162437	162438	162438	he	2275	" I mean , "
162441	162473	162438	162438	he	2275	" that she might have affected you by her exquisite amiability - a real revelation , it has seemed to myself ; her high rarity , her distinction of every sort . "
162485	162487	162490	162490	he	2275	" precious "
162540	162607	162533	162533	she	113	" A ' revelation ' - to ME : I 've come to such a woman for a revelation ? You talk to me about ' distinction ' - YOU , you who 've had your privilege ? - when the most distinguished woman we shall either of us have seen in this world sits there insulted , in her loneliness , by your incredible comparison ! "
162625	162638	162619	162619	he	82	" Does your mother herself make the point that she sits insulted ? "
162647	162650	162639	162639	Sarah	126	" pat , "
162666	162693	162639	162639	Sarah	126	" She has confided to my judgement and my tenderness the expression of her personal sense of everything , and the assertion of her personal dignity . "
162738	162766	162767	162767	he	82	" If she does really feel as you say it 's of course very very dreadful . I 've given sufficient proof , one would have thought , "
162770	162779	162767	162767	he	82	" of my deep admiration for Mrs. Newsome . "
162780	162806	162807	162807	He	82	" And pray what proof would one have thought you 'd CALL sufficient ? That of thinking this person here so far superior to her ? "
162814	162827	162811	162811	he	82	" Ah dear Sarah , you must LEAVE me this person here ! "
162892	162919	162920	162920	she	2283	" That 's exactly what I 'm delighted to do . God knows WE do n't want her ! You take good care not to meet , "
162928	162955	162920	162920	she	2283	" my question about their life . If you do consider it a thing one can even SPEAK of , I congratulate you on your taste ! "
163038	163117	163119	163119	he	82	" I think tremendously well of her , at the same time that I seem to feel her ' life ' to be really none of my business . It 's my business , that is , only so far as Chad 's own life is affected by it ; and what has happened , do n't you see ? is that Chad 's has been affected so beautifully . The proof of the pudding 's in the eating "
163208	163261	163262	163262	I	0	" This was n't quite for her the air of salvation ; but as that chill fairly deepened what did it become but a reminder that one might at the worst perish WITH her ? And it was simple enough - it was rudimentary : not , not to give her away . "
163284	163288	163281	163281	you	2286	" he enquired , "
163377	163378	163353	163353	you	2286	" "
163387	163434	163353	163353	you	2286	" And Sarah gave a jerk back of her head that well might have nullified any active proximity . It kept her friend himself at his distance , and he respected for a moment the interval . Then with a last persuasive effort he bridged it . "
163449	163450	163444	163444	Chad	111	" "
163453	163464	163465	163465	I	0	" she echoed again . And indeed she was prepared . "
163470	163547	163465	163465	I	0	" Her departure had been for some minutes marked as imminent , and she was already at the door that stood open to the court , from the threshold of which she delivered herself of this judgement . It rang out so loud as to produce for the time the hush of everything else . Strether quite , as an effect of it , breathed less bravely ; he could acknowledge it , but simply enough . "
163555	163556	163550	163550	you	0	" "
163574	164867	164868	164868	She	2288	" She passed out as she spoke and took her way straight across the court , beyond which , separated from them by the deep arch of the porte - cochere the low victoria that had conveyed her from her own hotel was drawn up . She made for it with decision , and the manner of her break , the sharp shaft of her rejoinder , had an intensity by which Strether was at first kept in arrest . She had let fly at him as from a stretched cord , and it took him a minute to recover from the sense of being pierced . It was not the penetration of surprise ; it was that , much more , of certainty ; his case being put for him as he had as yet only put it to himself . She was away at any rate ; she had distanced him - with rather a grand spring , an effect of pride and ease , after all ; she had got into her carriage before he could overtake her , and the vehicle was already in motion . He stopped halfway ; he stood there in the court only seeing her go and noting that she gave him no other look . The way he had put it to himself was that all quite MIGHT be at an end . Each of her movements , in this resolute rupture , reaffirmed , re - enforced that idea . Sarah passed out of sight in the sunny street while , planted there in the centre of the comparatively grey court , he continued merely to look before him . It probably WAS all at an end . Book Eleventh Note : In the 1909 New York Edition the following two chapters were placed in the reverse of the order appearing below . Since 1950 , most scholars have agreed , because of the internal evidence of the two chapters , that an editorial error caused them to be printed in reverse order . This Etext , like other editions of the past four decades , corrects the apparent error . - Richard D. Hathaway , preparer of this electronic text I He went late that evening to the Boulevard Malesherbes , having his impression that it would be vain to go early , and having also , more than once in the course of the day , made enquiries of the concierge . Chad had n't come in and had left no intimation ; he had affairs , apparently , at this juncture - as it occurred to Strether he so well might have - that kept him long abroad . Our friend asked once for him at the hotel in the Rue de Rivoli , but the only contribution offered there was the fact that every one was out . It was with the idea that he would have to come home to sleep that Strether went up to his rooms , from which however he was still absent , though , from the balcony , a few moments later , his visitor heard eleven o'clock strike . Chad 's servant had by this time answered for his reappearance ; he HAD , the visitor learned , come quickly in to dress for dinner and vanish again . Strether spent an hour in waiting for him - an hour full of strange suggestions , persuasions , recognitions ; one of those that he was to recall , at the end of his adventure , as the particular handful that most had counted . The mellowest lamplight and the easiest chair had been placed at his disposal by Baptiste , subtlest of servants ; the novel half - uncut , the novel lemon - coloured and tender , with the ivory knife athwart it like the dagger in a contadina 's hair , had been pushed within the soft circle - a circle which , for some reason , affected Strether as softer still after the same Baptiste had remarked that in the absence of a further need of anything by Monsieur he would betake himself to bed . The night was hot and heavy and the single lamp sufficient ; the great flare of the lighted city , rising high , spending itself afar , played up from the Boulevard and , through the vague vista of the successive rooms , brought objects into view and added to their dignity . Strether found himself in possession as he never yet had been ; he had been there alone , had turned over books and prints , had invoked , in Chad 's absence , the spirit of the place , but never at the witching hour and never with a relish quite so like a pang . He spent a long time on the balcony ; he hung over it as he had seen little Bilham hang the day of his first approach , as he had seen Mamie hang over her own the day little Bilham himself might have seen her from below ; he passed back into the rooms , the three that occupied the front and that communicated by wide doors ; and , while he circulated and rested , tried to recover the impression that they had made on him three months before , to catch again the voice in which they had seemed then to speak to him . That voice , he had to note , failed audibly to sound ; which he took as the proof of all the change in himself . He had heard , of old , only what he COULD then hear ; what he could do now was to think of three months ago as a point in the far past . All voices had grown thicker and meant more things ; they crowded on him as he moved about - it was the way they sounded together that would n't let him be still . He felt , strangely , as sad as if he had come for some wrong , and yet as excited as if he had come for some freedom . But the freedom was what was most in the place and the hour , it was the freedom that most brought him round again to the youth of his own that he had long ago missed . He could have explained little enough to - day either why he had missed it or why , after years and years , he should care that he had ; the main truth of the actual appeal of everything was none the less that everything represented the substance of his loss put it within reach , within touch , made it , to a degree it had never been , an affair of the senses . That was what it became for him at this singular time , the youth he had long ago missed - a queer concrete presence , full of mystery , yet full of reality , which he could handle , taste , smell , the deep breathing of which he could positively hear . It was in the outside air as well as within ; it was in the long watch , from the balcony , in the summer night , of the wide late life of Paris , the unceasing soft quick rumble , below , of the little lighted carriages that , in the press , always suggested the gamblers he had seen of old at Monte Carlo pushing up to the tables . This image was before him when he at last became aware that Chad was behind . "
164877	165352	164868	164868	She	2288	" - he had arrived after this promptly enough at that information ; which expressed the case however quite as the young man appeared willing for the moment to leave it . Other things , with this advantage of their virtually having the night before them , came up for them , and had , as well , the odd effect of making the occasion , instead of hurried and feverish , one of the largest , loosest and easiest to which Strether 's whole adventure was to have treated him . He had been pursuing Chad from an early hour and had overtaken him only now ; but now the delay was repaired by their being so exceptionally confronted . They had foregathered enough of course in all the various times ; they had again and again , since that first night at the theatre , been face to face over their question ; but they had never been so alone together as they were actually alone - their talk had n't yet been so supremely for themselves . And if many things moreover passed before them , none passed more distinctly for Strether than that striking truth about Chad of which he had been so often moved to take note : the truth that everything came happily back with him to his knowing how to live . It had been seated in his pleased smile - a smile that pleased exactly in the right degree - as his visitor turned round , on the balcony , to greet his advent ; his visitor in fact felt on the spot that there was nothing their meeting would so much do as bear witness to that facility . He surrendered himself accordingly to so approved a gift ; for what was the meaning of the facility but that others DID surrender themselves ? He did n't want , luckily , to prevent Chad from living ; but he was quite aware that even if he had he would himself have thoroughly gone to pieces . It was in truth essentially by bringing down his personal life to a function all subsidiary to the young man 's own that he held together . And the great point , above all , the sign of how completely Chad possessed the knowledge in question , was that one thus became , not only with a proper cheerfulness , but with wild native impulses , the feeder of his stream . Their talk had accordingly not lasted three minutes without Strether 's feeling basis enough for the excitement in which he had waited . This overflow fairly deepened , wastefully abounded , as he observed the smallness of anything corresponding to it on the part of his friend . That was exactly this friend 's happy case ; he "
165355	165432	165433	165433	I	0	" his excitement , or whatever other emotion the matter involved , as he put out his washing ; than which no arrangement could make more for domestic order . It was quite for Strether himself in short to feel a personal analogy with the laundress bringing home the triumphs of the mangle . When he had reported on Sarah 's visit , which he did very fully , Chad answered his question with perfect candour . "
165529	165535	165522	165522	I	0	" the young man continued ; "
165567	165568	165569	165569	Her	2290	" "
165572	165576	165581	165581	she	2290	" Strether returned , "
165666	165667	165651	165651	you	2291	" "
165678	165687	165651	165651	you	2291	" Chad enquired in objection to this luminosity , "
165696	165697	165698	165698	You	2291	" "
165762	165775	165776	165776	I	0	" Chad cast a pleasant backward glance over his possibilities of motive . "
165800	165808	165740	165740	she	126	" Strether smiled at his comfortable clearness . "
165840	165911	165917	165917	yours	2297	" Ah but Chad , with his completer conception of the friendly , would n't quite have this ! They had remained on the balcony , where , after their day of great and premature heat , the midnight air was delicious ; and they leaned back in turn against the balustrade , all in harmony with the chairs and the flower - pots , the cigarettes and the starlight . "
165938	165942	165933	165933	my	0	" Chad pursued - "
165956	165957	165958	165958	I	0	" "
165966	165970	165971	165971	I	0	" Strether explained ; "
166083	166100	166071	166071	I	0	" Chad turned up his face to the sky with a slow puff of his smoke . "
166107	166113	166071	166071	I	0	" Strether waited a little . "
166150	166151	166126	166126	I	0	" "
166159	166160	166153	166153	you	0	" "
166183	166184	166174	166174	We	2300	" "
166187	166204	166206	166206	he	2291	" said Chad , ' splendid conditions ! It was open to them , open to them "
166254	166291	166292	166292	Strether	82	" It was open to them simply to let me alone ; to have made up their minds , on really seeing me for themselves , that I could go on well enough as I was . "
166352	166373	166345	166345	Chad	111	" But they 've made up their minds to the opposite - that you CAN'T go on as you are . "
166374	166377	166378	166378	Chad	111	" No , "
166385	166395	166378	166378	Chad	111	" they wo n't have it for a minute . "
166427	166448	166396	166396	Strether	82	" There never was the smallest chance , do you know , that they WOULD have it for a moment . "
166449	166469	166396	166396	Strether	82	" Of course not - no real chance . But if they were willing to think there was - ! "
166470	166476	166477	166477	Strether	82	" They were n't willing . "
166484	166586	166477	166477	Strether	82	" It was n't for you they came out , but for me . It was n't to see for themselves what you 're doing , but what I 'm doing . The first branch of their curiosity was inevitably destined , under my culpable delay , to give way to the second ; and it 's on the second that , if I may use the expression and you do n't mind my marking the invidious fact , they 've been of late exclusively perched . When Sarah sailed it was me , in other words , they were after . "
166598	166614	166615	166615	Strether	82	" It IS rather a business then - what I 've let you in for ! "
166663	166674	166640	166640	Chad	111	" I was ' in ' when you found me . "
166675	166682	166683	166685	the young man	2833	" Ah but it was you , "
166688	166693	166683	166685	the young man	2833	" who found ME . "
166694	166736	166737	166737	Strether	82	" I only found you out . It was you who found me in . It was all in the day 's work for them , at all events , that they should come . And they 've greatly enjoyed it , "
166740	166750	166752	166752	Chad	111	" Well , I 've tried to make them , "
166763	166815	166816	166816	Chad	111	" So have I. I tried even this very morning - while Mrs. Pocock was with me . She enjoys for instance , almost as much as anything else , not being , as I 've said , afraid of me ; and I think I gave her help in that . "
166822	166829	166830	166830	Strether	82	" Was she very very nasty ? "
166833	166869	166830	166830	Strether	82	" Well , she was the most important thing - she was definite . She was - at last - crystalline . And I felt no remorse . I saw that they must have come . "
166870	166890	166891	166891	Chad	111	" Oh I wanted to see them for myself ; so that if it were only for THAT - ! "
166906	166930	166931	166931	Chad	111	" Is n't your having seen them for yourself then THE thing , beyond all others , that has come of their visit ? "
166948	166975	166980	166980	he	111	" Do n't you count it as anything that you 're dished - if you ARE dished ? Are you , my dear man , dished ? "
167003	167016	166980	166980	he	111	" I want to see her again . I must see her . "
167017	167023	166980	166980	he	111	" Of course you must . "
167028	167038	167025	167025	Chad	111	" Do you mean - a - Mother herself ? "
167039	167048	166980	166980	he	111	" Oh your mother - that will depend . "
167078	167088	167089	167089	Strether	82	" What do you mean it will depend on ? "
167101	167132	167089	167089	Strether	82	" I was speaking of Sarah . I must positively - though she quite cast me off - see HER again . I ca n't part with her that way . "
167133	167140	167142	167142	Strether	82	" Then she was awfully unpleasant ? "
167145	167180	167181	167181	he	111	" She was what she had to be . I mean that from the moment they 're not delighted they can only be - well what I admit she was . We gave them , "
167185	167211	167181	167181	he	111	" their chance to be delighted , and they 've walked up to it , and looked all round it , and not taken it . "
167212	167222	167223	167223	Chad	111	" You can bring a horse to water - ! "
167226	167266	167223	167223	Chad	111	" Precisely . And the tune to which this morning Sarah was n't delighted - the tune to which , to adopt your metaphor , she refused to drink - leaves us on that side nothing more to hope . "
167278	167298	167267	167267	Chad	111	" It was never of course really the least on the cards that they would be ' delighted . ' "
167299	167310	167311	167311	Strether	82	" Well , I do n't know , after all , "
167314	167325	167327	167327	he	82	" I 've had to come as far round . However "
167332	167342	167327	167327	he	82	" it 's doubtless MY performance that 's absurd . "
167343	167349	167351	167351	Chad	111	" There are certainly moments , "
167353	167371	167372	167372	he	111	" when you seem to me too good to be true . Yet if you are true , "
167375	167386	167372	167372	he	111	" that seems to be all that need concern me . "
167387	167417	167418	167418	Strether	82	" I 'm true , but I 'm incredible . I 'm fantastic and ridiculous - I do n't explain myself even TO myself . How can they then , "
167421	167433	167418	167418	Strether	82	" understand me ? So I do n't quarrel with them . "
167434	167441	167443	167443	Chad	111	" I see . They quarrel , "
167447	167451	167443	167443	Chad	111	" with US . "
167468	167508	167460	167462	his young friend	2784	" I should feel greatly ashamed , all the same , if I did n't put it before you again that you ought to think , after all , tremendously well . I mean before giving up beyond recall - "
167527	167536	167523	167523	Strether	82	" Say it all , say it all . "
167537	167565	167566	167566	Chad	111	" Well , at your age , and with what - when all 's said and done - Mother might do for you and be for you . "
167593	167657	167659	167659	he	82	" My absence of an assured future . The little I have to show toward the power to take care of myself . The way , the wonderful way , she would certainly take care of me . Her fortune , her kindness , and the constant miracle of her having been disposed to go even so far . Of course , of course "
167664	167671	167659	167659	he	82	" There are those sharp facts . "
167680	167689	167672	167672	Chad	111	" And do n't you really care - ? "
167698	167703	167672	167672	Chad	111	" Will you go ? "
167704	167721	167722	167722	he	82	" I 'll go if you 'll say you now consider I should . You know , "
167726	167734	167722	167722	he	82	" I was ready six weeks ago . "
167735	167738	167740	167740	Strether	82	" Ah , "
167742	167765	167740	167740	Strether	82	" that was when you did n't know I was n't ! You 're ready at present because you do know it . "
167766	167771	167772	167772	Chad	111	" That may be , "
167775	167813	167814	167814	Strether	82	" but all the same I 'm sincere . You talk about taking the whole thing on your shoulders , but in what light do you regard me that you think me capable of letting you pay ? "
167863	167895	167814	167814	Strether	82	" What it literally comes to for you , if you 'll pardon my putting it so , is that you give up money . Possibly a good deal of money . "
167896	167899	167900	167900	Strether	82	" Oh , "
167903	167955	167900	167900	Strether	82	" if it were only just enough you 'd still be justified in putting it so ! But I 've on my side to remind you too that YOU give up money ; and more than ' possibly ' - quite certainly , as I should suppose - a good deal . "
167956	167968	167969	167969	Chad	111	" True enough ; but I 've got a certain quantity , "
167975	167985	167969	167969	Chad	111	" Whereas you , my dear man , you - "
167986	167994	167996	167996	Strether	82	" I ca n't be at all said "
168001	168022	167996	167996	Strether	82	" to have a ' quantity ' certain or uncertain ? Very true . Still , I sha n't starve . "
168023	168030	168031	168031	Chad	111	" Oh you must n't STARVE ! "
168152	168186	168187	168187	Her	2319	" To this Chad replied that they had on the contrary kept tremendously polite ; adding moreover that Sally was after all not the woman to have made the mistake of not being . "
168206	168211	168215	168215	her	2319	" he sagaciously observed , "
168217	168218	168215	168215	her	2319	" "
168229	168230	168221	168221	she	2319	" "
168273	168274	168263	168263	she	2319	" "
168282	168286	168276	168276	she	2319	" said Strether , "
168296	168297	168290	168290	she	2319	" "
168311	168317	168300	168300	she	2319	" After which Chad observed : "
168331	168337	168327	168327	she	2319	" Strether 's interest grew . "
168347	168348	168341	168341	she	2319	" "
168371	168382	168367	168367	she	2319	" Strether followed afresh , but looking as he went . "
168430	168431	168419	168419	you	0	" "
168434	168469	168419	168419	you	0	" said Chad , ' she can bear ME - could bear me at least at home . It 's my being there that would be her triumph . She hates me in Paris . "
168470	168477	168419	168419	you	0	" She hates in other words - "
168478	168485	168487	168487	Chad	111	" Yes , THAT 'S it ! "
168594	168605	168606	168606	he	111	" And I 'll tell you who hates me too , "
168626	168637	168638	168638	he	111	" Ah no ! Mamie does n't hate - well , "
168644	168653	168654	168654	Chad	111	" anybody at all . Mamie 's beautiful . "
168659	168675	168654	168654	Chad	111	" That 's just why I mind it . She certainly does n't like me . "
168676	168691	168713	168713	It	2324	" How much do you mind it ? What would you do for her ? "
168692	168709	168710	168710	Chad	111	" Well , I 'd like her if she 'd like me . Really , really , "
168722	168768	168713	168713	It	2324	" You asked me just now if I do n't , as you said , ' care ' about a certain person . You rather tempt me therefore to put the question in my turn . Do n't YOU care about a certain other person ? "
168781	168792	168769	168769	Chad	111	" The difference is that I do n't want to . "
168796	168804	168769	168769	Chad	111	" ' Do n't want ' to ? "
168805	168829	168830	168832	the young man	2833	" I try not to - that is I HAVE tried . I 've done my best . You ca n't be surprised , "
168837	168850	168851	168851	he	2833	" when you yourself set me on it . I was indeed , "
168854	168880	168851	168851	he	2833	" already on it a little ; but you set me harder . It was six weeks ago that I thought I had come out . "
168887	168895	168881	168881	Strether	82	" But you have n't come out ! "
168896	168910	168912	168912	Chad	111	" I do n't know - it 's what I WANT to know , "
168914	168938	168912	168912	Chad	111	" And if I could have sufficiently wanted - by myself - to go back , I think I might have found out . "
168939	168941	168943	168943	Strether	82	" Possibly "
168946	168965	168966	168966	he	2833	" But all you were able to achieve was to want to want to ! And even then , "
168969	168985	168966	168966	he	2833	" only till our friends there came . Do you want to want to still ? "
169033	169037	169026	169026	he	111	" DO you ? "
169057	169064	169065	169065	he	111	" Jim IS a damned dose ! "
169068	169121	169065	169065	he	111	" Oh I do n't ask you to abuse or describe or in any way pronounce on your relatives ; I simply put it to you once more whether you 're NOW ready . You say you 've ' seen . ' Is what you 've seen that you ca n't resist ? "
169141	169150	169122	169122	Chad	111	" Ca n't you make me NOT resist ? "
169151	169157	169158	169158	Strether	82	" What it comes to , "
169173	169213	169167	169167	he	111	" what it comes to is that more has been done for you , I think , than I 've ever seen done - attempted perhaps , but never so successfully done - by one human being for another . "
169214	169220	169122	169122	Chad	111	" Oh an immense deal certainly "
169228	169237	169222	169222	Chad	111	" And you yourself are adding to it . "
169249	169259	169245	169246	his visitor	430	" And our friends there wo n't have it . "
169260	169268	169167	169167	he	111	" No , they simply wo n't . "
169269	169295	169296	169296	Strether	82	" They demand you on the basis , as it were , of repudiation and ingratitude ; and what has been the matter with me , "
169300	169316	169296	169296	Strether	82	" is that I have n't seen my way to working with you for repudiation . "
169321	169340	169296	169296	Strether	82	" Then as you have n't seen yours you naturally have n't seen mine . There it is . "
169356	169367	169368	169368	Strether	82	" NOW do you say she does n't hate me ? "
169371	169377	169368	169368	Strether	82	" ' She ' - ? "
169378	169396	169296	169296	Strether	82	" Yes - Mother . We called it Sarah , but it comes to the same thing . "
169397	169400	169401	169401	Strether	82	" Ah , "
169404	169415	169401	169401	Strether	82	" not to the same thing as her hating YOU . "
169434	169451	169430	169430	Chad	111	" Well , if they hate my good friend , THAT comes to the same thing . "
169481	169484	169473	169475	The young man	2833	" good friend "
169535	169550	169530	169530	he	2833	" Their hating you too moreover - that also comes to a good deal . "
169551	169554	169556	169556	Strether	82	" Ah , "
169558	169564	169556	169556	Strether	82	" your mother does n't . "
169582	169592	169580	169580	Strether	82	" She will if you do n't look out . "
169593	169615	169616	169617	our friend	235	" Well , I do look out . I am , after all , looking out . That 's just why , "
169620	169628	169629	169629	It	2333	" I want to see her again . "
169638	169643	169629	169629	It	2333	" To see Mother ? "
169644	169654	169616	169617	our friend	235	" To see - for the present - Sarah . "
169655	169675	169676	169676	Chad	111	" Ah then there you are ! And what I do n't for the life of me make out , "
169682	169690	169676	169676	Chad	111	" is what you GAIN by it . "
169703	169734	169676	169676	Chad	111	" That 's because you have , I verily believe , no imagination . You 've other qualities . But no imagination , do n't you see ? at all . "
169735	169744	169616	169617	our friend	235	" I dare say . I do see . "
169755	169765	169616	169617	our friend	235	" But have n't you yourself rather too much ? "
169766	169771	169676	169676	Chad	111	" Oh RATHER - ! "
169998	170005	170006	170006	he	111	" But they 're all off , "
170009	170013	170006	170006	he	111	" at last . "
170020	170029	170006	170006	he	111	" All ? - Mr. Newsome with them ? "
170030	170054	170055	170055	Strether	82	" Ah not yet ! Sarah and Jim and Mamie . But Waymarsh with them - for Sarah . It 's too beautiful , "
170058	170083	170084	170084	he	111	" I find I do n't get over that - it 's always a fresh joy . But it 's a fresh joy too , "
170087	170110	170084	170084	he	111	" that - well , what do you think ? Little Bilham also goes . But he of course goes for Mamie . "
170115	170129	170111	170112	Miss Gostrey	99	" ' For ' her ? Do you mean they 're already engaged ? "
170130	170133	170135	170135	Strether	82	" Well , "
170177	170185	170171	170171	SHE'LL	97	" Miss Gostrey gave a comprehensive sigh . "
170194	170195	170188	170188	you	82	" "
170271	170272	170255	170255	Mamie	97	" "
170290	170291	170282	170282	you	82	" "
170323	170332	170313	170313	I	0	" She saw as usual what he meant . "
170343	170344	170313	170313	I	0	" "
170347	170353	170313	170313	I	0	" Strether had to admit , "
170419	170424	170403	170403	he	118	" he went on , "
170435	170447	170448	170448	He	118	" Miss Gostrey , already knowing , instantly made the connexion . "
170456	170457	170458	170458	He	118	" "
170491	170492	170495	170495	yourself	2344	" "
170497	170501	170495	170495	yourself	2344	" Maria smiled . "
170514	170542	170504	170504	he	118	" And then as his friend showed how she could believe it , filling it out , fitting it on to old memories of the wonderful woman : "
170556	170557	170553	170553	HER	162	" "
170564	170565	170553	170553	HER	162	" "
170590	170601	170587	170587	She	162	" - he followed up his renewed vision of her - "
170605	170614	170615	170615	She	162	" Miss Gostrey went with him a minute . "
170620	170621	170622	170622	She	162	" "
170628	170632	170625	170625	I	0	" he pursued , "
170641	170642	170625	170625	I	0	" "
170648	170649	170651	170651	Chad	111	" "
170666	170673	170663	170663	she	162	" - it kept before him - "
170695	170713	170663	170663	she	162	" It kept her so before him that his companion had after an instant a friendly comment . "
170733	170738	170726	170726	you	0	" Maria threw off . "
170748	170752	170726	170726	you	0	" he replied . "
170770	170771	170786	170787	the five	2350	" "
170775	170782	170783	170783	they	2349	" - Maria continued to smile - "
170802	170803	170795	170795	you	0	" "
170808	170814	170806	170806	Chad	111	" To which Strether added : "
170818	170819	170820	170820	Ah	2351	" "
170825	170847	170820	170820	Ah	2351	" - she gave a small impatient wail again , in which something of the unreconciled seemed suddenly to break out . "
170883	170887	170875	170875	I	0	" Strether hesitated . "
170911	170912	170907	170907	your	0	" "
170945	170946	170936	170936	I	0	" "
170953	170957	170949	170949	you	0	" he asked . "
170971	170972	170968	170968	you	0	" "
170975	170982	170968	170968	you	0	" she said as he dropped . "
170996	171002	171004	171004	you	0	" She thought a moment . "
171011	171012	171004	171004	you	0	" "
171023	171024	171015	171015	I	0	" "
171036	171040	171043	171043	myself	0	" said Maria , "
171085	171117	171079	171079	you	0	" She had spoken as resigned to his word , but he had of a sudden a still sharper sense than he would have expected of desiring not to lose her . "
171123	171154	171079	171079	you	0	" She took it as if the words were all she had wished ; as if they brought her , gave her something that was the compensation of her case . "
171158	171174	171156	171156	you	0	" she simply answered . And then as he looked at her a little harder , "
171180	171207	171176	171176	you	0	" she repeated . It had broken as with a slight arrest into the current of their talk , and it held him a moment longer . "
171246	171250	171230	171230	you	0	" She recalled . "
171261	171265	171267	171267	you	0	" she continued , "
171279	171304	171305	171305	I	0	" He looked away from her on this ; he indulged , so far as space permitted , in one of his slow absences . "
171339	171340	171329	171329	I	0	" "
171348	171349	171345	171345	you	0	" "
171370	171371	171345	171345	you	0	" "
171380	171384	171345	171345	you	0	" she laughed , "
171391	171395	171397	171397	you	0	" she added , "
171410	171411	171408	171408	you	0	" "
171418	171422	171412	171412	I	0	" Strether declared . "
171425	171426	171412	171412	I	0	" "
171429	171430	171412	171412	I	0	" "
171463	171472	171452	171454	Marie de Vionnet	162	" He looked as if he considerably doubted . "
171486	171487	171473	171473	You	0	" "
171507	171508	171500	171500	I	0	" "
171512	171516	171500	171500	I	0	" he continued , "
171534	171540	171541	171541	I	0	" Maria kept it together . "
171562	171566	171559	171559	my	0	" she went on "
171572	171573	171559	171559	my	0	" "
171579	171583	171559	171559	my	0	" said Strether , "
171599	171600	171596	171596	her	162	" "
171609	171624	171625	171625	Men	745	" He thought - but had n't , naturally , to think too long . "
171627	171628	171629	171629	She	162	" "
171652	171653	171643	171643	she	162	" "
171660	171667	171668	171668	YOU	0	" Strether a trifle ambiguously sighed . "
171670	171675	171668	171668	YOU	0	" he handsomely declared , "
171686	171687	171692	171692	you	0	" "
171694	171704	171692	171692	you	0	" - she echoed it as he had done . "
171712	171718	171708	171708	you	0	" she less ironically said , "
171727	171738	171739	171739	I	0	" He stopped before her , full of the disposition . "
171744	171763	171739	171739	I	0	" Which indeed begot in her , with a certain inconsequence , a return of her small wail . "
171769	171957	171766	171766	you	0	" There , if it were so , he continued for the rest of the time to be , and it was as if to show her how she could still serve him that , coming back to the departure of the Pococks , he gave her the view , vivid with a hundred more touches than we can reproduce , of what had happened for him that morning . He had had ten minutes with Sarah at her hotel , ten minutes reconquered , by irresistible pressure , from the time over which he had already described her to Miss Gostrey as having , at the end of their interview on his own premises , passed the great sponge of the future . He had caught her by not announcing himself , had found her in her sitting - room with a dressmaker and a lingere whose accounts she appeared to have been more or less ingenuously settling and who soon withdrew . Then he had explained to her how he had succeeded , late the night before , in keeping his promise of seeing Chad . "
171967	171968	171969	171969	You	0	" "
171976	171977	171969	171969	You	0	" "
171985	171989	171980	171980	he	2358	" Maria waited . "
171998	172008	171980	171980	he	2358	" she enquired with a certain grimness of gaiety . "
172011	172015	171980	171980	he	2358	" said Strether , "
172027	172028	172018	172018	I	0	" "
172036	172045	172018	172018	I	0	" his companion brought out after a moment , "
172055	172062	172050	172050	you	0	" He stood before her again . "
172087	172103	172073	172073	Chad	111	" She could believe that , but she made , as always , for clearness . "
172115	172116	172118	172118	they	2359	" "
172128	172129	172118	172118	they	2359	" "
172141	172142	172136	172138	Madame de Vionnet	85	" "
172155	172156	172136	172138	Madame de Vionnet	85	" "
172169	172170	172166	172166	YOU	0	" "
172173	172177	172166	172166	YOU	0	" said Strether , "
172194	172204	172184	172184	I	0	" But his friend none the less went on . "
172219	172258	172208	172209	Mrs. Newsome	88	" It was a straighter mode of dealing with this lady than they had as yet - such was their high form - permitted themselves ; but it seemed not wholly for this that he delayed a moment . "
172277	172278	172272	172272	she	88	" "
172289	172290	172283	172283	you	0	" "
172297	172306	172291	172291	I	0	" Strether thought it worth while to mention . "
172332	172337	172339	172339	you	0	" Maria went on , "
172371	172372	172360	172360	you	0	" "
172376	172380	172360	172360	you	0	" he laughed , "
172389	172397	172387	172387	yours	0	" But this barely struck her now . "
172425	172426	172409	172409	You	0	" "
172429	172433	172409	172409	You	0	" he insisted , "
172471	172502	172463	172463	I	0	" But he was ready to declare again that this did n't in the least matter ; all the more that , as he affirmed , he HADn't really as yet "
172506	172507	172508	172508	She	88	" "
172578	172583	172548	172548	she	88	" Miss Gostrey considered . "
172615	172616	172617	172617	He	111	" "
172644	172648	172641	172641	I	0	" Maria stared . "
172655	172666	172667	172667	I	0	" Well , he as usual walked about on it . "
172720	172721	172696	172696	she	88	" "
172725	172730	172696	172696	she	88	" Miss Gostrey enquired , "
172743	172744	172696	172696	she	88	" "
172764	172765	172696	172696	she	88	" "
172771	172772	172696	172696	she	88	" "
172775	172797	172696	172696	she	88	" She had spoken with impatience , but , so far as that at least , he knew where he was . "
172832	172833	172886	172886	you	0	" "
172843	172847	172840	172840	I	0	" she returned , "
172853	172854	172849	172849	you	0	" "
172859	172863	172849	172849	you	0	" he said , "
172948	172955	172960	172960	you	0	" he benevolently smiled for her , "
172962	172963	172960	172960	you	0	" "
172966	172970	172960	172960	you	0	" she objected , "
173006	173010	173027	173027	she	85	" she pursued , "
173061	173071	173027	173027	she	85	" - it was her duty to suggest it - "
173086	173093	173136	173136	you	0	" - she kept it up - "
173111	173134	173105	173105	you	0	" Strether seemed to face it as if it were a happy thought ; but the next moment he spoke more critically . "
173146	173151	173152	173152	I	0	" She just considered . "
173170	173174	173136	173136	you	0	" she added , "
173192	173193	173136	173136	you	0	" "
173197	173201	173136	173136	you	0	" Strether conceded , "
173209	173210	173202	173202	my	0	" "
173261	173267	173271	173271	them	2368	" she presently threw off , "
173290	173328	173271	173271	them	2368	" He looked at her , on this , as if some generous irritation - all in his interest - had suddenly again flickered in her ; and what she next said indeed half - explained it . "
173381	173390	173405	173405	I	0	" And she kept it up still more . "
173433	173438	173471	173471	he	111	" she wound up , "
173457	173467	173471	173471	he	111	" The thought in fact held her a moment . "
173490	173491	173492	173492	My	0	" "
173496	173510	173492	173492	My	0	" Strether replied - and he had it even to himself surprisingly ready - "
173572	173585	173586	173586	I	0	" Well , she succeeded after a little in shaking it off . "
173607	173608	173604	173604	you	0	" "
173616	173621	173611	173611	you	0	" he kindly said , "
173631	173632	173623	173623	you	0	" "
173638	173639	173635	173636	Mrs. Newsome	88	" "
173659	173660	173642	173642	Sarah	126	" "
173668	173677	173642	173642	Sarah	126	" she responsively mused , ' so extraordinary ! "
173678	173684	173685	173685	he	111	" Well , you see , "
173689	173727	173685	173685	he	111	" what it comes to is that she 's all cold thought - which Sarah could serve to us cold without its really losing anything . So it is that we know what she thinks of us . "
173738	173781	173733	173733	she	162	" What I 've never made out , if you come to that , is what you think - I mean you personally - of HER . Do n't you so much , when all 's said , as care a little ? "
173782	173785	173786	173786	he	111	" That , "
173794	173828	173829	173829	he	111	" is what even Chad himself asked me last night . He asked me if I do n't mind the loss - well , the loss of an opulent future . Which moreover , "
173834	173841	173829	173829	he	111	" was a perfectly natural question . "
173842	173852	173854	173855	Miss Gostrey	99	" I call your attention , all the same , "
173857	173886	173854	173855	Miss Gostrey	99	" to the fact that I do n't ask it . What I venture to ask is whether it 's to Mrs. Newsome herself that you 're indifferent . "
173887	173893	173895	173895	he	111	" I have n't been so "
173901	173979	173895	173895	he	111	" I 've been the very opposite . I 've been , from the first moment , preoccupied with the impression everything might be making on her - quite oppressed , haunted , tormented by it . I 've been interested ONLY in her seeing what I 've seen . And I 've been as disappointed in her refusal to see it as she has been in what has appeared to her the perversity of my insistence . "
173980	173995	173996	173996	Strether	82	" Do you mean that she has shocked you as you 've shocked her ? "
174000	174034	173996	173996	Strether	82	" I 'm probably not so shockable . But on the other hand I 've gone much further to meet her . She , on her side , has n't budged an inch . "
174035	174043	174045	174045	Maria	162	" So that you 're now at last "
174050	174058	174045	174045	Maria	162	" in the sad stage of recriminations . "
174059	174104	174105	174105	She	162	" No - it 's only to you I speak . I 've been like a lamb to Sarah . I 've only put my back to the wall . It 's to THAT one naturally staggers when one has been violently pushed there . "
174111	174115	174105	174105	She	162	" Thrown over ? "
174116	174134	174135	174135	She	162	" Well , as I feel I 've landed somewhere I think I must have been thrown . "
174151	174163	174135	174135	She	162	" The thing is that I suppose you 've been disappointing - "
174164	174187	174105	174105	She	162	" Quite from the very first of my arrival ? I dare say . I admit I was surprising even to myself . "
174188	174194	174195	174195	Maria	162	" And then of course , "
174199	174208	174195	174195	Maria	162	" I had much to do with it . "
174209	174216	174105	174105	She	162	" With my being surprising - ? "
174217	174222	174105	174105	She	162	" That will do , "
174226	174240	174241	174241	she	162	" if you 're too delicate to call it MY being ! Naturally , "
174244	174254	174241	174241	she	162	" you came over more or less for surprises . "
174255	174258	174260	174260	he	2383	" Naturally ! "
174265	174275	174277	174277	she	162	" But they were to have been all for you "
174284	174292	174277	174277	she	162	" and none of them for HER . "
174307	174443	174295	174295	he	2383	" That 's just her difficulty - that she does n't admit surprises . It 's a fact that , I think , describes and represents her ; and it falls in with what I tell you - that she 's all , as I 've called it , fine cold thought . She had , to her own mind , worked the whole thing out in advance , and worked it out for me as well as for herself . Whenever she has done that , you see , there 's no room left ; no margin , as it were , for any alteration . She 's filled as full , packed as tight , as she 'll hold and if you wish to get anything more or different either out or in - "
174444	174456	174465	174465	Strether	82	" You 've got to make over altogether the woman herself ? "
174457	174463	174465	174465	Strether	82	" What it comes to , "
174467	174482	174465	174465	Strether	82	" is that you 've got morally and intellectually to get rid of her . "
174483	174488	174489	174489	Maria	162	" Which would appear , "
174492	174501	174489	174489	Maria	162	" to be practically what you 've done . "
174510	174544	174545	174545	he	82	" I have n't touched her . She wo n't BE touched . I see it now as I 've never done ; and she hangs together with a perfection of her own , "
174549	174570	174571	174571	he	82	" that does suggest a kind of wrong in ANY change of her composition . It was at any rate , "
174575	174604	174571	174571	he	82	" the woman herself , as you call her the whole moral and intellectual being or block , that Sarah brought me over to take or to leave . "
174613	174633	174607	174608	Miss Gostrey	99	" Fancy having to take at the point of the bayonet a whole moral and intellectual being or block ! "
174634	174640	174642	174642	Strether	82	" It was in fact , "
174644	174665	174642	174642	Strether	82	" what , at home , I HAD done . But somehow over there I did n't quite know it . "
174666	174674	174675	174676	Miss Gostrey	99	" One never does , I suppose , "
174679	174725	174675	174676	Miss Gostrey	99	" realise in advance , in such a case , the size , as you may say , of the block . Little by little it looms up . It has been looming for you more and more till at last you see it all . "
174726	174732	174733	174733	he	82	" I see it all , "
174755	174760	174761	174761	he	82	" It 's magnificent ! "
174786	174805	174768	174780	his friend , who was used to this kind of inconsequence in him	2387	" There 's nothing so magnificent - for making others feel you - as to have no imagination . "
174812	174838	174768	174780	his friend , who was used to this kind of inconsequence in him	2387	" Ah there you are ! It 's what I said last night to Chad . That he himself , I mean , has none . "
174839	174845	174846	174846	Maria	162	" Then it would appear , "
174849	174864	174846	174846	Maria	162	" that he has , after all , something in common with his mother . "
174865	174887	174888	174888	he	82	" He has in common that he makes one , as you say , ' feel ' him . And yet , "
174898	174910	174888	174888	he	82	" one feels others too , even when they have plenty . "
174916	174921	174911	174912	Miss Gostrey	99	" Madame de Vionnet ? "
174922	174927	174846	174846	Maria	162	" SHE has plenty . "
174928	174949	174846	174846	Maria	162	" Certainly - she had quantities of old . But there are different ways of making one 's self felt . "
174950	174965	174966	174966	He	82	" Yes , it comes , no doubt , to that . You now - "
174979	175000	175001	175001	she	162	" Oh I DON'T make myself felt ; so my quantity need n't be settled . Yours , you know , "
175004	175016	175001	175001	she	162	" is monstrous . No one has ever had so much . "
175024	175032	175001	175001	she	162	" That 's what Chad also thinks . "
175033	175050	175062	175062	Strether	82	" There YOU are then - though it is n't for him to complain of it ! "
175051	175060	175062	175062	Strether	82	" Oh he does n't complain of it , "
175064	175078	175062	175062	Strether	82	" That 's all that would be wanting ! But apropos of what , "
175083	175090	175079	175079	Maria	162	" did the question come up ? "
175091	175104	175105	175105	She	162	" Well , of his asking me what it is I gain . "
175110	175127	175128	175128	she	162	" Then as I 've asked you too it settles my case . Oh you HAVE , "
175131	175136	175128	175128	she	162	" treasures of imagination . "
175157	175263	175150	175150	he	82	" And yet Mrs. Newsome - it 's a thing to remember - HAS imagined , did , that is , imagine , and apparently still does , horrors about what I should have found . I was booked , by her vision - extraordinarily intense , after all - to find them ; and that I did n't , that I could n't , that , as she evidently felt , I would n't - this evidently did n't at all , as they say , ' suit ' her book . It was more than she could bear . That was her disappointment . "
175264	175276	175350	175350	she	388	" You mean you were to have found Chad himself horrible ? "
175277	175286	175350	175350	she	388	" I was to have found the woman . "
175287	175290	175150	175150	he	82	" Horrible ? "
175291	175299	175350	175350	she	388	" Found her as she imagined her . "
175326	175339	175320	175321	His companion	388	" She imagined stupidly - so it comes to the same thing . "
175340	175345	175347	175347	Strether	82	" Stupidly ? Oh ! "
175353	175358	175350	175350	she	388	" She imagined meanly . "
175367	175375	175359	175359	He	82	" It could n't but be ignorantly . "
175376	175389	175320	175321	His companion	388	" Well , intensity with ignorance - what do you want worse ? "
175403	175420	175398	175398	he	82	" Sarah is n't ignorant - now ; she keeps up the theory of the horrible . "
175421	175471	175359	175359	He	82	" Ah but she 's intense - and that by itself will do sometimes as well . If it does n't do , in this case , at any rate , to deny that Marie 's charming , it will do at least to deny that she 's good . "
175472	175484	175359	175359	He	82	" What I claim is that she 's good for Chad . "
175485	175490	175492	175492	she	388	" You do n't claim "
175499	175507	175509	175509	he	82	" that she 's good for YOU . "
175514	175537	175509	175509	he	82	" That 's what I wanted them to come out for - to see for themselves if she 's bad for him . "
175538	175558	175359	175359	He	82	" And now that they 've done so they wo n't admit that she 's good even for anything ? "
175559	175564	175565	175565	Strether	82	" They do think , "
175569	175605	175565	175565	Strether	82	" that she 's on the whole about as bad for me . But they 're consistent of course , inasmuch as they 've their clear view of what 's good for both of us . "
175606	175613	175615	175615	Maria	162	" For you , to begin with "
175627	175701	175615	175615	Maria	162	" to eliminate from your existence and if possible even from your memory the dreadful creature that I must gruesomely shadow forth for them , even more than to eliminate the distincter evil - thereby a little less portentous - of the person whose confederate you 've suffered yourself to become . However , that 's comparatively simple . You can easily , at the worst , after all , give me up . "
175702	175717	175359	175359	He	82	" I can easily at the worst , after all , give you up . "
175729	175744	175359	175359	He	82	" I can easily at the worst , after all , even forget you . "
175745	175766	175615	175615	Maria	162	" Call that then workable . But Mr. Newsome has much more to forget . How can HE do it ? "
175767	175798	175799	175799	She	2389	" Ah there again we are ! That 's just what I was to have made him do ; just where I was to have worked with him and helped . "
175829	175849	175850	175850	She	2389	" Do you remember how we used to talk at Chester and in London about my seeing you through ? "
175871	175880	175850	175850	She	2389	" It 's just what you ARE doing . "
175881	175907	175850	175850	She	2389	" Ah but the worst - since you 've left such a margin - may be still to come . You may yet break down . "
175908	175924	175925	175925	He	2392	" Yes , I may yet break down . But will you take me - ? "
175933	175937	175925	175925	He	2392	" Take you ? "
175938	175948	175949	175949	She	2389	" For as long as I can bear it . "
175952	175981	175949	175949	She	2389	" Mr. Newsome and Madame de Vionnet may , as we were saying , leave town . How long do you think you can bear it without them ? "
175993	176005	176006	176006	Her	2389	" Do you mean in order to get away from me ? "
176012	176029	176006	176006	Her	2389	" Do n't find me rude if I say I should think they 'd want to ! "
176058	176069	176055	176055	he	2392	" You mean after what they 've done to me ? "
176070	176076	176030	176030	He	2392	" After what SHE has . "
176092	176102	176086	176086	he	2392	" Ah but she has n't done it yet ! "
176267	176271	176272	176272	he	2392	" been through , "
178254	178260	178240	178240	they	2432	" Do n't mention it ! "
178315	178436	178307	178307	his	2392	" Do n't like me , if it 's a question of liking me , for anything obvious and clumsy that I 've , as they call it , ' done ' for you : like me - well , like me , hang it , for anything else you choose . So , by the same propriety , do n't be for me simply the person I 've come to know through my awkward connexion with Chad - was ever anything , by the way , MORE awkward ? Be for me , please , with all your admirable tact and trust , just whatever I may show you it 's a present pleasure to me to think you . "
179202	179204	179169	179169	they	2459	" The "
179565	179567	179573	179573	she	2470	" bitter "
180812	180814	180810	180810	their	2492	" cut "
181300	181306	181296	181296	her	85	" Comme cela se trouve ! "
183617	183636	183616	183616	her	99	" What on earth - that 's what I want to know now - had you then supposed ? "
185669	186527	187004	187004	you	2615	" he would have risked saying , that such suggestions should keep crossing the scene ; but it was doubtless the effect of the thunder in the air , which had hung about all day without release . His hostess was dressed as for thunderous times , and it fell in with the kind of imagination we have just attributed to him that she should be in simplest coolest white , of a character so old - fashioned , if he were not mistaken , that Madame Roland must on the scaffold have worn something like it . This effect was enhanced by a small black fichu or scarf , of crape or gauze , disposed quaintly round her bosom and now completing as by a mystic touch the pathetic , the noble analogy . Poor Strether in fact scarce knew what analogy was evoked for him as the charming woman , receiving him and making him , as she could do such things , at once familiarly and gravely welcome , moved over her great room with her image almost repeated in its polished floor , which had been fully bared for summer . The associations of the place , all felt again ; the gleam here and there , in the subdued light , of glass and gilt and parquet , with the quietness of her own note as the centre - these things were at first as delicate as if they had been ghostly , and he was sure in a moment that , whatever he should find he had come for , it would n't be for an impression that had previously failed him . That conviction held him from the outset , and , seeming singularly to simplify , certified to him that the objects about would help him , would really help them both . No , he might never see them again - this was only too probably the last time ; and he should certainly see nothing in the least degree like them . He should soon be going to where such things were not , and it would be a small mercy for memory , for fancy , to have , in that stress , a loaf on the shelf . He knew in advance he should look back on the perception actually sharpest with him as on the view of something old , old , old , the oldest thing he had ever personally touched ; and he also knew , even while he took his companion in as the feature among features , that memory and fancy could n't help being enlisted for her . She might intend what she would , but this was beyond anything she could intend , with things from far back - tyrannies of history , facts of type , values , as the painters said , of expression - all working for her and giving her the supreme chance , the chance of the happy , the really luxurious few , the chance , on a great occasion , to be natural and simple . She had never , with him , been more so ; or if it was the perfection of art it would never - and that came to the same thing - be proved against her . What was truly wonderful was her way of differing so from time to time without detriment to her simplicity . Caprices , he was sure she felt , were before anything else bad manners , and that judgement in her was by itself a thing making more for safety of intercourse than anything that in his various own past intercourses he had had to reckon on . If therefore her presence was now quite other than the one she had shown him the night before , there was nothing of violence in the change - it was all harmony and reason . It gave him a mild deep person , whereas he had had on the occasion to which their interview was a direct reference a person committed to movement and surface and abounding in them ; but she was in either character more remarkable for nothing than for her bridging of intervals , and this now fell in with what he understood he was to leave to her . The only thing was that , if he was to leave it ALL to her , why exactly had she sent for him ? He had had , vaguely , in advance , his explanation , his view of the probability of her wishing to set something right , to deal in some way with the fraud so lately practised on his presumed credulity . Would she attempt to carry it further or would she blot it out ? Would she throw over it some more or less happy colour ; or would she do nothing about it at all ? He perceived soon enough at least that , however reasonable she might be , she was n't vulgarly confused , and it herewith pressed upon him that their eminent "
186530	186994	187004	187004	you	2615	" Chad 's and hers , was simply after all such an inevitable tribute to good taste as he could n't have wished them not to render . Away from them , during his vigil , he had seemed to wince at the amount of comedy involved ; whereas in his present posture he could only ask himself how he should enjoy any attempt from her to take the comedy back . He should n't enjoy it at all ; but , once more and yet once more , he could trust her . That is he could trust her to make deception right . As she presented things the ugliness - goodness knew why - went out of them ; none the less too that she could present them , with an art of her own , by not so much as touching them . She let the matter , at all events , lie where it was - where the previous twenty - four hours had placed it ; appearing merely to circle about it respectfully , tenderly , almost piously , while she took up another question . She knew she had n't really thrown dust in his eyes ; this , the previous night , before they separated , had practically passed between them ; and , as she had sent for him to see what the difference thus made for him might amount to , so he was conscious at the end of five minutes that he had been tried and tested . She had settled with Chad after he left them that she would , for her satisfaction , assure herself of this quantity , and Chad had , as usual , let her have her way . Chad was always letting people have their way when he felt that it would somehow turn his wheel for him ; it somehow always did turn his wheel . Strether felt , oddly enough , before these facts , freshly and consentingly passive ; they again so rubbed it into him that the couple thus fixing his attention were intimate , that his intervention had absolutely aided and intensified their intimacy , and that in fine he must accept the consequence of that . He had absolutely become , himself , with his perceptions and his mistakes , his concessions and his reserves , the droll mixture , as it must seem to them , of his braveries and his fears , the general spectacle of his art and his innocence , almost an added link and certainly a common priceless ground for them to meet upon . It was as if he had been hearing their very tone when she brought out a reference that was comparatively straight . "
187012	187205	187007	187007	I	0	" she said with an abrupt transition - they had been pretending before this to talk simply of the charm of yesterday and of the interest of the country they had seen . The effort was confessedly vain ; not for such talk had she invited him ; and her impatient reminder was of their having done for it all the needful on his coming to her after Sarah 's flight . What she had n't asked him then was to state to her where and how he stood for her ; she had been resting on Chad 's report of their midnight hour together in the Boulevard Malesherbes . The thing therefore she at present desired was ushered in by this recall of the two occasions on which , disinterested and merciful , she had n't worried him . To - night truly she WOULD worry him , and this was her appeal to him to let her risk it . He was n't to mind if she bored him a little : she had behaved , after all - had n't she ? - so awfully , awfully well . II "
187218	187283	187213	187213	you	2617	" he almost impatiently declared ; his impatience being moreover not for her pressure , but for her scruple . More and more distinct to him was the tune to which she would have had the matter out with Chad : more and more vivid for him the idea that she had been nervous as to what he might be able to ' stand . "
187296	187486	187292	187292	he	2618	" what the scene on the river had given him , and , though the young man had doubtless opined in favour of his recuperation , her own last word must have been that she should feel easier in seeing for herself . That was it , unmistakeably ; she WAS seeing for herself . What he could stand was thus , in these moments , in the balance for Strether , who reflected , as he became fully aware of it , that he must properly brace himself . He wanted fully to appear to stand all he might ; and there was a certain command of the situation for him in this very wish not to look too much at sea . She was ready with everything , but so , sufficiently , was he ; that is he was at one point the more prepared of the two , inasmuch as , for all her cleverness , she could n't produce on the spot - and it was surprising - an account of the motive of her note . He had the advantage that his pronouncing her "
187489	187496	187498	187498	I	0	" gave him for an enquiry . "
187518	187612	187510	187510	you	2619	" He spoke as if she might have seen he had been waiting for it - not indeed with discomfort , but with natural interest . Then he saw that she was a little taken aback , was even surprised herself at the detail she had neglected - the only one ever yet ; having somehow assumed he would know , would recognise , would leave some things not to be said . She looked at him , however , an instant as if to convey that if he wanted them ALL - ! "
187650	187655	187657	187657	I	0	" she went on , "
187873	187877	187869	187869	I	0	" she asked , "
187885	187896	187869	187869	I	0	" And as he found himself unable immediately to say : "
187926	187927	187920	187920	one	2797	" "
187940	187941	187920	187920	one	2797	" "
187970	187976	187978	187978	we	2633	" she beautifully brought out , "
188003	188007	187978	187978	we	2633	" she pursued , "
188031	188051	188016	188016	I	0	" Then as if the straightness of this appeal , taking him unprepared , had visibly left him wondering : "
188117	188130	188098	188098	I	0	" She pulled up short . Oh but he wanted to hear . "
188135	188136	188098	188098	I	0	" "
188143	188144	188145	188145	Ah	2634	" "
188151	188155	188145	188145	Ah	2634	" he laughed - "
188160	188161	188145	188145	Ah	2634	" "
188166	188172	188145	188145	Ah	2634	" - she was eager . "
188293	188353	188354	188354	You	2619	" Interesting , touching , strikingly sincere as she let these things come from her , she yet puzzled and troubled him - so fine was the quaver of her quietness . He felt what he had felt before with her , that there was always more behind what she showed , and more and more again behind that . "
188361	188365	188354	188354	You	2619	" she added , "
188370	188371	188354	188354	You	2619	" "
188414	188418	188397	188397	You	2619	" Strether said , "
188455	188460	188452	188452	you	2619	" he wound up , "
188465	188466	188452	188452	you	2619	" "
188527	188532	188537	188537	I	0	" she nervously repeated - "
188596	188603	188593	188593	you	2619	" she continued after a moment , "
188644	189163	188639	188639	you	2619	" she asked with a quick change . He took some time to reply - his last impression was more and more so mixed a one . It produced in him a vague disappointment , a drop that was deeper even than the fall of his elation the previous night . The good of what he had done , if he had done so much , was n't there to enliven him quite to the point that would have been ideal for a grand gay finale . Women were thus endlessly absorbent , and to deal with them was to walk on water . What was at bottom the matter with her , embroider as she might and disclaim as she might - what was at bottom the matter with her was simply Chad himself . It was of Chad she was after all renewedly afraid ; the strange strength of her passion was the very strength of her fear ; she clung to HIM , Lambert Strether , as to a source of safety she had tested , and , generous graceful truthful as she might try to be , exquisite as she was , she dreaded the term of his being within reach . With this sharpest perception yet , it was like a chill in the air to him , it was almost appalling , that a creature so fine could be , by mysterious forces , a creature so exploited . For at the end of all things they WERE mysterious : she had but made Chad what he was - so why could she think she had made him infinite ? She had made him better , she had made him best , she had made him anything one would ; but it came to our friend with supreme queerness that he was none the less only Chad . Strether had the sense that HE , a little , had made him too ; his high appreciation had as it were , consecrated her work The work , however admirable , was nevertheless of the strict human order , and in short it was marvellous that the companion of mere earthly joys , of comforts , aberrations however one classed them within the common experience should be so transcendently prized . It might have made Strether hot or shy , as such secrets of others brought home sometimes do make us ; but he was held there by something so hard that it was fairly grim . This was not the discomposure of last night ; that had quite passed - such discomposures were a detail ; the real coercion was to see a man ineffably adored . There it was again - it took women , it took women ; if to deal with them was to walk on water what wonder that the water rose ? And it had never surely risen higher than round this woman . He presently found himself taking a long look from her , and the next thing he knew he had uttered all his thought . "
189171	189245	189164	189164	You	2644	" It drew out her long look , and he soon enough saw why . A spasm came into her face , the tears she had already been unable to hide overflowed at first in silence , and then , as the sound suddenly comes from a child , quickened to gasps , to sobs . She sat and covered her face with her hands , giving up all attempt at a manner . "
189259	189268	189256	189256	you	2644	" - she caught her breath with it - "
189291	189599	189256	189256	you	2644	" Her emotion was at first so incoherent that he could only stand there at a loss , stand with his sense of having upset her , though of having done it by the truth . He had to listen to her in a silence that he made no immediate effort to attenuate , feeling her doubly woeful amid all her dim diffused elegance ; consenting to it as he had consented to the rest , and even conscious of some vague inward irony in the presence of such a fine free range of bliss and bale . He could n't say it was NOT no matter ; for he was serving her to the end , he now knew , anyway - quite as if what he thought of her had nothing to do with it . It was actually moreover as if he did n't think of her at all , as if he could think of nothing but the passion , mature , abysmal , pitiful , she represented , and the possibilities she betrayed . She was older for him to - night , visibly less exempt from the touch of time ; but she was as much as ever the finest and subtlest creature , the happiest apparition , it had been given him , in all his years , to meet ; and yet he could see her there as vulgarly troubled , in very truth , as a maidservant crying for her young man . The only thing was that she judged herself as the maidservant would n't ; the weakness of which wisdom too , the dishonour of which judgement , seemed but to sink her lower . Her collapse , however , no doubt , was briefer and she had in a manner recovered herself before he intervened . "
189619	189635	189685	189685	I	0	" He was silent a little longer , as if thinking what it might be . "
189649	189673	189639	189639	I	0	" But she threw off at last , with a sharp sad headshake , drying her eyes , what he could still do . "
189776	189781	189769	189769	your	0	" she went on , "
189884	189899	189900	189900	him	2648	" Positively , strangely , bitterly , as it seemed to Strether , she gave "
189902	189909	189910	189910	You	0	" for the moment , away . "
189936	189940	189933	189933	you	0	" she added . "
189947	189952	189942	189942	you	0	" He gained time . "
189958	189959	189954	189954	I	0	" "
189972	189980	189968	189968	you	0	" But he had already stopped her . "

190009	190013	190006	190006	I	0	" she returned - "
190157	190170	190143	190143	I	0	" He could only after a moment re - echo Miss Barrace . "
190175	190176	190171	190171	You	0	" "
190184	190194	190171	190171	You	0	" - she went on as without hearing him . "
190260	190282	190285	190285	you	0	" With which she came back again to what , face to face with him , had so quite broken down . "
190316	190341	190313	190313	me	0	" She exhaled it into air . He took refuge in repeating something he had already said and that she had made nothing of . "
190352	190378	190345	190345	I	0	" And he put his hand out for good - bye . She again made nothing of it ; she went on with her insistence . "
190392	190393	190399	190399	YOU	0	" "
190401	190410	190399	190399	YOU	0	" he said . She shook her head . "
190437	190454	190428	190428	I	0	" She had n't taken his hand , but she moved with him to the door . "
190459	190463	190428	190428	I	0	" he laughed , "
190468	190469	190428	190428	I	0	" "
190476	190480	190428	190428	I	0	" she replied , "
190520	190521	190514	190514	I	0	" "
190529	190652	190524	190524	you	0	" he declared , at the door , with an emphasis that made an end . III His purpose had been to see Chad the next day , and he had prefigured seeing him by an early call ; having in general never stood on ceremony in respect to visits at the Boulevard Malesherbes . It had been more often natural for him to go there than for Chad to come to the small hotel , the attractions of which were scant ; yet it nevertheless , just now , at the eleventh hour , did suggest itself to Strether to begin by giving the young man a chance . It struck him that , in the inevitable course , Chad would be "
190655	192232	190524	190524	you	0	" as Waymarsh used to say - Waymarsh who already , somehow , seemed long ago . He had n't come the day before , because it had been arranged between them that Madame de Vionnet should see their friend first ; but now that this passage had taken place he would present himself , and their friend would n't have long to wait . Strether assumed , he became aware , on this reasoning , that the interesting parties to the arrangement would have met betimes , and that the more interesting of the two - as she was after all - would have communicated to the other the issue of her appeal . Chad would know without delay that his mother 's messenger had been with her , and , though it was perhaps not quite easy to see how she could qualify what had occurred , he would at least have been sufficiently advised to feel he could go on . The day , however , brought , early or late , no word from him , and Strether felt , as a result of this , that a change had practically come over their intercourse . It was perhaps a premature judgement ; or it only meant perhaps - how could he tell ? - that the wonderful pair he protected had taken up again together the excursion he had accidentally checked . They might have gone back to the country , and gone back but with a long breath drawn ; that indeed would best mark Chad 's sense that reprobation had n't rewarded Madame de Vionnet 's request for an interview . At the end of the twenty - four hours , at the end of the forty - eight , there was still no overture ; so that Strether filled up the time , as he had so often filled it before , by going to see Miss Gostrey . He proposed amusements to her ; he felt expert now in proposing amusements ; and he had thus , for several days , an odd sense of leading her about Paris , of driving her in the Bois , of showing her the penny steamboats - those from which the breeze of the Seine was to be best enjoyed - that might have belonged to a kindly uncle doing the honours of the capital to an Intelligent niece from the country . He found means even to take her to shops she did n't know , or that she pretended she did n't ; while she , on her side , was , like the country maiden , all passive modest and grateful - going in fact so far as to emulate rusticity in occasional fatigues and bewilderments . Strether described these vague proceedings to himself , described them even to her , as a happy interlude ; the sign of which was that the companions said for the time no further word about the matter they had talked of to satiety . He proclaimed satiety at the outset , and she quickly took the hint ; as docile both in this and in everything else as the intelligent obedient niece . He told her as yet nothing of his late adventure - for as an adventure it now ranked with him ; he pushed the whole business temporarily aside and found his interest in the fact of her beautiful assent . She left questions unasked - she who for so long had been all questions ; she gave herself up to him with an understanding of which mere mute gentleness might have seemed the sufficient expression . She knew his sense of his situation had taken still another step - of that he was quite aware ; but she conveyed that , whatever had thus happened for him , it was thrown into the shade by what was happening for herself . This - though it might n't to a detached spirit have seemed much - was the major interest , and she met it with a new directness of response , measuring it from hour to hour with her grave hush of acceptance . Touched as he had so often been by her before , he was , for his part too , touched afresh ; all the more that though he could be duly aware of the principle of his own mood he could n't be equally so of the principle of hers . He knew , that is , in a manner - knew roughly and resignedly - what he himself was hatching ; whereas he had to take the chance of what he called to himself Maria 's calculations . It was all he needed that she liked him enough for what they were doing , and even should they do a good deal more would still like him enough for that ; the essential freshness of a relation so simple was a cool bath to the soreness produced by other relations . These others appeared to him now horribly complex ; they bristled with fine points , points all unimaginable beforehand , points that pricked and drew blood ; a fact that gave to an hour with his present friend on a bateau - mouche , or in the afternoon shade of the Champs Elysees , something of the innocent pleasure of handling rounded ivory . His relation with Chad personally - from the moment he had got his point of view - had been of the simplest ; yet this also struck him as bristling , after a third and a fourth blank day had passed . It was as if at last however his care for such indications had dropped ; there came a fifth blank day and he ceased to enquire or to heed . They now took on to his fancy , Miss Gostrey and he , the image of the Babes in the Wood ; they could trust the merciful elements to let them continue at peace . He had been great already , as he knew , at postponements ; but he had only to get afresh into the rhythm of one to feel its fine attraction . It amused him to say to himself that he might for all the world have been going to die - die resignedly ; the scene was filled for him with so deep a death - bed hush , so melancholy a charm . That meant the postponement of everything else - which made so for the quiet lapse of life ; and the postponement in especial of the reckoning to come - unless indeed the reckoning to come were to be one and the same thing with extinction . It faced him , the reckoning , over the shoulder of much interposing experience - which also faced him ; and one would float to it doubtless duly through these caverns of Kubla Khan . It was really behind everything ; it had n't merged in what he had done ; his final appreciation of what he had done - his appreciation on the spot - would provide it with its main sharpness . The spot so focussed was of course Woollett , and he was to see , at the best , what Woollett would be with everything there changed for him . Would n't THAT revelation practically amount to the wind - up of his career ? Well , the summer 's end would show ; his suspense had meanwhile exactly the sweetness of vain delay ; and he had with it , we should mention , other pastimes than Maria 's company - plenty of separate musings in which his luxury failed him but at one point . He was well in port , the outer sea behind him , and it was only a matter of getting ashore . There was a question that came and went for him , however , as he rested against the side of his ship , and it was a little to get rid of the obsession that he prolonged his hours with Miss Gostrey . It was a question about himself , but it could only be settled by seeing Chad again ; it was indeed his principal reason for wanting to see Chad . After that it would n't signify - it was a ghost that certain words would easily lay to rest . Only the young man must be there to take the words . Once they were taken he would n't have a question left ; none , that is , in connexion with this particular affair . It would n't then matter even to himself that he might now have been guilty of speaking BECAUSE of what he had forfeited . That was the refinement of his supreme scruple - he wished so to leave what he had forfeited out of account . He wished not to do anything because he had missed something else , because he was sore or sorry or impoverished , because he was maltreated or desperate ; he wished to do everything because he was lucid and quiet , just the same for himself on all essential points as he had ever been . Thus it was that while he virtually hung about for Chad he kept mutely putting it : "
192250	192500	192503	192503	she	2659	" It would have sickened him to feel vindictive . These tints of feeling indeed were doubtless but the iridescence of his idleness , and they were presently lost in a new light from Maria . She had a fresh fact for him before the week was out , and she practically met him with it on his appearing one night . He had n't on this day seen her , but had planned presenting himself in due course to ask her to dine with him somewhere out of doors , on one of the terraces , in one of the gardens , of which the Paris of summer was profuse . It had then come on to rain , so that , disconcerted , he changed his mind ; dining alone at home , a little stuffily and stupidly , and waiting on her afterwards to make up his loss . He was sure within a minute that something had happened ; it was so in the air of the rich little room that he had scarcely to name his thought . Softly lighted , the whole colour of the place , with its vague values , was in cool fusion - an effect that made the visitor stand for a little agaze . It was as if in doing so now he had felt a recent presence - his recognition of the passage of which his hostess in turn divined . She had scarcely to say it - "
192515	192527	192503	192503	she	2659	" It was n't till a minute later that she added : "
192541	192542	192503	192503	she	2659	" "
192548	192549	192503	192503	she	2659	" "
192563	192564	192565	192565	I	0	" "
192573	192577	192565	192565	I	0	" Strether said , "
192654	192658	192651	192651	she	2659	" he added , "
192666	192667	192651	192651	she	2659	" "
192675	193230	192673	192673	me	0	" Maria returned ; on which he was further sure that she was practically in possession of what he himself had n't yet told her . He was even sure she was in possession of things he himself could n't have told ; for the consciousness of them was now all in her face and accompanied there with a shade of sadness that marked in her the close of all uncertainties . It came out for him more than ever yet that she had had from the first a knowledge she believed him not to have had , a knowledge the sharp acquisition of which might be destined to make a difference for him . The difference for him might not inconceivably be an arrest of his independence and a change in his attitude - in other words a revulsion in favour of the principles of Woollett . She had really prefigured the possibility of a shock that would send him swinging back to Mrs. Newsome . He had n't , it was true , week after week , shown signs of receiving it , but the possibility had been none the less in the air . What Maria accordingly had had now to take in was that the shock had descended and that he had n't , all the same , swung back . He had grown clear , in a flash , on a point long since settled for herself ; but no reapproximation to Mrs. Newsome had occurred in consequence . Madame de Vionnet had by her visit held up the torch to these truths , and what now lingered in poor Maria 's face was the somewhat smoky light of the scene between them . If the light however was n't , as we have hinted , the glow of joy , the reasons for this also were perhaps discernible to Strether even through the blur cast over them by his natural modesty . She had held herself for months with a firm hand ; she had n't interfered on any chance - and chances were specious enough - that she might interfere to her profit . She had turned her back on the dream that Mrs. Newsome 's rupture , their friend 's forfeiture - the engagement the relation itself , broken beyond all mending - might furnish forth her advantage ; and , to stay her hand from promoting these things , she had on private , difficult , but rigid , lines , played strictly fair . She could n't therefore but feel that , though , as the end of all , the facts in question had been stoutly confirmed , her ground for personal , for what might have been called interested , elation remained rather vague . Strether might easily have made out that she had been asking herself , in the hours she had just sat through , if there were still for her , or were only not , a fair shade of uncertainty . Let us hasten to add , however , that what he at first made out on this occasion he also at first kept to himself . He only asked what in particular Madame de Vionnet had come for , and as to this his companion was ready . "

193376	193380	193372	193372	she	2663	" he asked , "

193401	193416	193386	193386	She	2663	" And he had one of the last flickers of his occasional mild mirth . "

193486	193502	193482	193482	She	2663	" she added - and it was as if at the touch of the connexion - "
193518	193519	193482	193482	She	2663	" "
193535	193539	193482	193482	She	2663	" Strether conceded , "

194010	194014	194016	194016	you	0	" she explained , "

194102	194127	194093	194093	She	2674	" She considered him with one of her deep returns of indulgence - returns out of all proportion to the irritations they flooded over . "

194140	194147	194134	194134	You	0	" he good - humouredly said ; "

194306	194319	194302	194302	She	2674	" Strether , on his side , did justice to that plea . "

194540	194548	194536	194538	Madame de Vionnet	85	" She had come back to him . "

194601	194611	194612	194612	She	2674	" Miss Gostrey asked as he let it drop . "
194620	194659	194612	194612	She	2674	" she pursued as he said nothing ; ' she took it for granted , at least , as any woman in her position would . But after that she changed her mind ; she believed you believed - "
194660	194663	194665	194665	he	2682	" Well ? "
194669	194703	194705	194705	Maria	97	" Why in her sublimity . And that belief had remained with her , I make out , till the accident of the other day opened your eyes . For that it did , "
194707	194711	194705	194705	Maria	97	" open them - "
194712	194717	194719	194719	he	2682	" She ca n't help "
194725	194731	194732	194732	he	2682	" being aware ? No , "
194735	194745	194732	194732	he	2682	" I suppose she thinks of that even yet . "
194746	194795	194705	194705	Maria	97	" Then they WERE closed ? There you are ! However , if you see her as the most charming woman in the world it comes to the same thing . And if you 'd like me to tell her that you do still so see her - ! "
194823	194832	194820	194820	he	2682	" She knows perfectly how I see her . "
194833	194871	194884	194884	she	97	" Not favourably enough , she mentioned to me , to wish ever to see her again . She told me you had taken a final leave of her . She says you 've done with her . "
194872	194877	194878	194878	Maria	97	" So I have . "
194891	194917	194884	194884	she	97	" She would n't have done with YOU . She feels she has lost you - yet that she might have been better for you . "
194918	194927	194928	194928	Strether	82	" Oh she has been quite good enough ! "
194931	194945	194928	194928	Strether	82	" She thinks you and she might at any rate have been friends . "
194946	194954	194956	194956	he	82	" We might certainly . That 's just "
194961	194967	194956	194956	he	82	" why I 'm going . "
194996	195003	194990	194990	she	97	" Shall I tell her that ? "
195004	195011	194956	194956	he	82	" No . Tell her nothing . "
195012	195017	194990	194990	she	97	" Very well then . "
195028	195033	195024	195025	Miss Gostrey	99	" Poor dear thing ! "
195043	195046	195024	195025	Miss Gostrey	99	" Me ? "
195047	195055	195056	195056	He	82	" Oh no . Marie de Vionnet . "
195066	195076	195062	195062	he	82	" Are you so sorry for her as that ? "
195099	195107	195093	195093	she	97	" I 'm sorry for us all ! "
196528	196553	196519	196519	He	82	" You 'll be a brute , you know - you 'll be guilty of the last infamy - if you ever forsake her . "
196796	196819	196827	196827	Strether	82	" Oh rather ! - if I should do anything of THAT sort . I hope you believe I really feel it . "
196820	196825	196827	196827	Strether	82	" I want it , "
196829	196869	196827	196827	Strether	82	" to be my last word of all to you . I ca n't say more , you know ; and I do n't see how I can do more , in every way , than I 've done . "
196882	196888	196870	196870	Chad	111	" You 've seen her ? "
196889	196912	196827	196827	Strether	82	" Oh yes - to say good - bye . And if I had doubted the truth of what I tell you - "
196913	196922	196923	196923	Chad	111	" She 'd have cleared up your doubt ? "
196926	196928	196923	196923	Chad	111	" rather "
196945	196952	196940	196940	he	111	" She must have been wonderful . "
196953	196957	196958	196958	Strether	82	" She WAS , "
197006	197043	197053	197053	he	111	" I do n't know what you 've really thought , all along ; I never did know - for anything , with you , seemed to be possible . But of course - of course - "
197061	197097	197098	197098	he	111	" After all , you understand . I spoke to you originally only as I HAD to speak . There 's only one way - is n't there ? - about such things . However , "
197105	197113	197098	197098	he	111	" I see it 's all right . "
197188	197197	197182	197182	he	82	" You HAVE really been to a distance ? "
197198	197205	197206	197206	Chad	111	" I 've been to England . "
197223	197230	197206	197206	Chad	111	" One must sometimes get off . "
197250	197277	197237	197237	he	82	" Of course you do as you 're free to do . But I hope , this time , that you did n't go for ME . "
197278	197293	197294	197294	Chad	111	" For very shame at bothering you really too much ? My dear man , "
197297	197305	197294	197294	Chad	111	" what WOULDn't I do for you ? "
197326	197349	197350	197350	Chad	111	" Even at the risk of being in your way I 've waited on , you know , for a definite reason . "
197355	197370	197372	197372	he	82	" Oh yes - for us to make if possible a still better impression . "
197382	197396	197372	197372	he	82	" I 'm delighted to gather that you feel we 've made it . "
197422	197446	197447	197447	he	82	" If I had my sense of wanting the rest of the time - the time of their being still on this side , "
197452	197461	197447	197447	he	82	" I know now why I wanted it . "
197488	197500	197501	197501	Strether	82	" You wanted to have been put through the whole thing . "
197533	197576	197511	197511	he	82	" I shall learn from the Bank here where they 're now having their letters , and my last word , which I shall write in the morning and which they 're expecting as my ultimatum , will so immediately reach them . "
197611	197624	197603	197603	He	82	" Of course I 've first to justify what I shall do . "
197625	197632	197633	197633	Chad	111	" You 're justifying it beautifully ! "
197636	197649	197650	197650	Strether	82	" It 's not a question of advising you not to go , "
197653	197683	197650	197650	Strether	82	" but of absolutely preventing you , if possible , from so much as thinking of it . Let me accordingly appeal to you by all you hold sacred . "
197689	197698	197684	197684	Chad	111	" What makes you think me capable - ? "
197699	197717	197718	197719	his companion	388	" You 'd not only be , as I say , a brute ; you 'd be , "
197727	197735	197718	197719	his companion	388	" a criminal of the deepest dye . "
197750	197766	197736	197736	Chad	111	" I do n't know what should make you think I 'm tired of her . "
197830	197859	197812	197813	his host	929	" I feel how much more she can do for you . She has n't done it all yet . Stay with her at least till she has . "
197860	197866	197867	197867	Chad	111	" And leave her THEN ? "
197883	197905	197906	197906	he	111	" Do n't leave her BEFORE . When you 've got all that can be got - I do n't say , "
197912	197949	197906	197906	he	111	" That will be the proper time . But as , for you , from such a woman , there will always be something to be got , my remark 's not a wrong to her . "
197972	197984	197950	197950	Chad	111	" I remember you , you know , as you were . "
197985	197994	198002	198002	he	111	" An awful ass , was n't I ? "
198029	198057	198021	198021	he	111	" You certainly then would n't have seemed worth all you 've let me in for . You 've defined yourself better . Your value has quintupled . "
198058	198069	198070	198070	Chad	111	" Well then , would n't that be enough - ? "
198081	198084	198077	198077	Strether	82	" Enough ? "
198085	198097	198021	198021	he	111	" If one SHOULD wish to live on one 's accumulations ? "
198120	198150	198151	198151	he	111	" Of course I really never forget , night or day , what I owe her . I owe her everything . I give you my word of honour , "
198156	198167	198151	198151	he	111	" that I 'm not a bit tired of her . "
198210	198212	198217	198217	he	82	" tired "
198230	198283	198285	198285	he	82	" She has never for a moment yet bored me - never been wanting , as the cleverest women sometimes are , in tact . She has never talked about her tact - as even they too sometimes talk ; but she has always had it . She has never had it more "
198291	198296	198298	198298	he	82	" than just lately . "
198303	198315	198316	198316	Strether	82	" She has never been anything I could call a burden . "
198335	198346	198324	198324	he	82	" Oh if you did n't do her justice - ! "
198347	198356	198364	198364	he	82	" I SHOULD be a beast , eh ? "
198394	198450	198451	198451	Chad	111	" You owe her everything - very much more than she can ever owe you . You 've in other words duties to her , of the most positive sort ; and I do n't see what other duties - as the others are presented to you - can be held to go before them . "
198459	198483	198451	198451	Chad	111	" And you know of course about the others , eh ? - since it 's you yourself who have done the presenting . "
198484	198512	198571	198571	Strether	82	" Much of it - yes - and to the best of my ability . But not all - from the moment your sister took my place . "
198513	198518	198519	198519	Chad	111	" She did n't , "
198522	198563	198519	198519	Chad	111	" Sally took a place , certainly ; but it was never , I saw from the first moment , to be yours . No one - with us - will ever take yours . It would n't be possible . "
198564	198569	198571	198571	Strether	82	" Ah of course , "
198573	198603	198604	198604	he	82	" I knew it . I believe you 're right . No one in the world , I imagine , was ever so portentously solemn . There I am , "
198622	198628	198604	198604	he	82	" I was made so . "
198660	198685	198686	198688	the young man	2833	" YOU have never needed any one to make you better . There has never been any one good enough . They could n't , "
198695	198704	198705	198705	Chad	111	" I beg your pardon . They HAVE . "
198715	198719	198720	198720	Strether	82	" Who then ? "
198731	198736	198720	198720	Strether	82	" Women - too . "
198737	198742	198744	198744	Chad	111	" ' Two ' ? "
198749	198782	198783	198783	he	82	" Oh I do n't believe , for such work , in any more than one ! So you 're proving too much . And what IS beastly , at all events , "
198786	198791	198783	198783	he	82	" is losing you . "
198807	198812	198804	198804	he	82	" Are you afraid ? "
198813	198817	198783	198783	he	82	" Afraid - ? "
198818	198830	198838	198838	he	111	" Of doing wrong . I mean away from my eye . "
198844	198850	198851	198851	he	111	" I AM , certainly , "
198854	198857	198851	198851	he	111	" prodigious . "
198858	198870	198851	198851	he	111	" Yes , you spoil us for all the stupid - ! "
198990	199003	199011	199011	he	111	" You need n't tell me , you need n't tell me ! "
199236	199246	199247	199247	They	2741	" It really does the thing , you know . "
199274	199287	199266	199266	Strether	82	" Affects , you mean , the sale of the object advertised ? "
199288	199380	199381	199381	He	111	" Yes - but affects it extraordinarily ; really beyond what one had supposed . I mean of course when it 's done as one makes out that in our roaring age , it CAN be done . I 've been finding out a little , though it doubtless does n't amount to much more than what you originally , so awfully vividly - and all , very nearly , that first night - put before me . It 's an art like another , and infinite like all the arts . "
199402	199431	199381	199381	He	111	" In the hands , naturally , of a master . The right man must take hold . With the right man to work it c'est un monde . "
199457	199482	199448	199448	he	111	" Is what you 're thinking of that you yourself , in the case you have in mind , would be the right man ? "
199513	199537	199538	199538	Strether	82	" Why , what is he but what you yourself , as I say , took me for when you first came out ? "
199550	199639	199545	199545	he	82	" Oh yes , and there 's no doubt that , with your natural parts , you 'd have much in common with him . Advertising is clearly at this time of day the secret of trade . It 's quite possible it will be open to you - giving the whole of your mind to it - to make the whole place hum with you . Your mother 's appeal is to the whole of your mind , and that 's exactly the strength of her case . "
199655	199666	199648	199648	he	111	" Ah we 've been through my mother 's case ! "
199667	199681	199545	199545	he	82	" So I thought . Why then do you speak of the matter ? "
199682	199727	199648	199648	he	111	" Only because it was part of our original discussion . To wind up where we began , my interest 's purely platonic . There at any rate the fact is - the fact of the possible . I mean the money in it . "
199728	199736	199738	199738	Strether	82	" Oh damn the money in it ! "
199756	199769	199743	199745	the young man	2833	" Shall you give your friend up for the money in it ? "
199784	199842	199843	199843	he	111	" You 're not altogether - in your so great ' solemnity ' - kind . Have n't I been drinking you in - showing you all I feel you 're worth to me ? What have I done , what am I doing , but cleave to her to the death ? The only thing is , "
199849	199888	199889	199889	he	111	" that one ca n't but have it before one , in the cleaving - the point where the death comes in . Do n't be afraid for THAT . It 's pleasant to a fellow 's feelings , "
199892	199907	199843	199843	he	111	" to ' size - up ' the bribe he applies his foot to . "
199908	199924	199934	199934	Chad	111	" Oh then if all you want 's a kickable surface the bribe 's enormous . "
199925	199933	199934	199934	Chad	111	" Good . Then there it goes ! "
199971	199980	199953	199953	they	2748	" Of course I shall see you tomorrow . "
200012	200017	199953	199953	they	2748	" You 're restless . "
200018	200021	200023	200023	Chad	111	" Ah , "
200028	200033	200034	200034	V	200	" you 're exciting . "
200317	200394	200308	200308	He	111	" There 's nothing more to wait for ; I seem to have done a good day 's work . I 've let them have it all round . I 've seen Chad , who has been to London and come back . He tells me I 'm ' exciting , ' and I seem indeed pretty well to have upset every one . I 've at any rate excited HIM . He 's distinctly restless . "
200395	200401	200402	200403	Miss Gostrey	99	" You 've excited ME , "
200406	200411	200402	200403	Miss Gostrey	99	" I'M distinctly restless . "
200412	200439	200440	200440	he	2760	" Oh you were that when I found you . It seems to me I 've rather got you out of it . What 's this , "
200448	200456	200443	200443	he	2760	" but a haunt of ancient peace ? "
200457	200465	200466	200466	she	99	" I wish with all my heart , "
200470	200483	200466	200466	she	99	" I could make you treat it as a haven of rest . "
200523	200551	200552	200552	he	2760	" It would n't give me - that would be the trouble - what it will , no doubt , still give you . I 'm not , "
200572	200610	200563	200563	his	2760	" in real harmony with what surrounds me . You ARE . I take it too hard . You DON'T. It makes - that 's what it comes to in the end - a fool of me . "
200616	200625	200626	200626	he	2760	" What has he been doing in London ? "
200629	200637	200638	200638	Maria	97	" Ah one may go to London , "
200641	200647	200638	200638	Maria	97	" You know I did . "
200655	200662	200650	200650	he	2760	" And you brought ME back . "
200674	200692	200693	200693	he	2760	" Whom has Chad brought ? He 's full of ideas . And I wrote to Sarah , "
200696	200714	200693	200693	he	2760	" the first thing this morning . So I 'm square . I 'm ready for them . "
200728	200751	200693	200693	he	2760	" Marie said to me the other day that she felt him to have the makings of an immense man of business . "
200752	200765	200693	200693	he	2760	" There it is . He 's the son of his father ! "
200766	200772	200693	200693	he	2760	" But SUCH a father ! "
200773	200794	200693	200693	he	2760	" Ah just the right one from that point of view ! But it is n't his father in him , "
200798	200803	200693	200693	he	2760	" that troubles me . "
200804	200810	200811	200811	He	82	" What is it then ? "
200900	200917	200881	200881	she	2763	" Do you remember our talking of it in London - that night at the play ? "
201000	201004	200952	200952	He	82	" come out . "
201327	201375	201379	201379	his	2769	" I do n't know whether it 's before you as a possibility that , left to himself , Mr. Chad may after all go back . I judge that it IS more or less so before you , from what you just now said of him . "
201397	201409	201379	201379	his	2769	" I do n't think it will be for the money . "
201417	201435	201413	201413	she	2766	" I mean I do n't believe it will be for that he 'll give her up . "
201436	201444	201445	201445	Strether	82	" Then he WILL give her up ? "
201479	201489	201534	201534	she	2766	" What were you just about to ask me ? "
201490	201505	201534	201534	she	2766	" Is there anything he can do that would make you patch it up ? "
201506	201511	201517	201517	she	2766	" With Mrs. Newsome ? "
201539	201554	201534	201534	she	2766	" Or is there anything he can do that would make HER try it ? "
201555	201563	201534	201534	she	2766	" To patch it up with me ? "
201574	201593	201594	201594	Maria	97	" There 's nothing any one can do . It 's over . Over for both of us . "
201603	201611	201594	201594	Maria	97	" Are you so sure for her ? "
201612	201630	201631	201631	She	97	" Oh yes - sure now . Too much has happened . I 'm different for her . "
201642	201655	201631	201631	She	97	" I see . So that as she 's different for YOU - "
201656	201660	201661	201661	he	82	" Ah but , "
201669	201677	201661	201661	he	82	" And as Miss Gostrey wondered again : "
201704	201733	201700	201700	I	0	" He spoke gravely and as if responsibly - since he had to pronounce ; and the effect of it was slightly solemn , so that she simply exclaimed "
201736	201756	201700	201700	I	0	" Satisfied and grateful , however , she showed in her own next words an acceptance of his statement . "
201765	201869	201760	201760	you	0	" He had pushed his plate a little away , occupied with another side of the matter ; taking refuge verily in that side and feeling so moved that he soon found himself on his feet . He was affected in advance by what he believed might come from her , and he would have liked to forestall it and deal with it tenderly ; yet in the presence of it he wished still more to be - though as smoothly as possible - deterrent and conclusive . He put her question by for the moment ; he told her more about Chad . "
201896	201897	201880	201880	he	2772	" "
201911	201912	201901	201901	you	0	" "
201938	201939	201930	201930	he	2772	" "
201952	201953	201947	201947	you	0	" "
201968	201969	201960	201960	I	0	" "
201972	201976	201977	201977	you	0	" she smiled , "
201982	201989	201977	201977	you	0	" And then having thought again : "
201997	202004	201990	201990	You	0	" Yet she scanned his face . "
202011	202022	202008	202009	Mrs. Newsome	88	" She hesitated afresh , but she brought it out . "
202062	202066	202058	202058	I	0	" she explained , "
202103	202104	202105	202105	I	0	" "
202109	202113	202105	202105	I	0	" said Strether , "
202166	202173	202174	202174	He	2772	" Maria saw what he meant . "
202180	202181	202174	202174	He	2772	" "
202192	202201	202185	202186	our friend	235	" Strether felt in it the strange irony . "
202209	202210	202216	202216	his	2772	" "
202222	202226	202229	202229	hers	2776	" said Strether , "
202236	202237	202232	202232	she	2776	" "
202249	202254	202246	202246	your	0	" Miss Gostrey asked , "
202264	202265	202258	202262	some other woman in London	2777	" "
202289	202299	202283	202283	I	0	" And he put out his hand to her . "
202304	202314	202283	202283	I	0	" It brought her back to her unanswered question . "
202322	202323	202324	202324	I	0	" "
202335	202336	202283	202283	I	0	" "
202342	202351	202283	202283	I	0	" she said as she kept his hand . "
202370	202371	202364	202364	I	0	" "
202380	202405	202373	202373	you	0	" But , as if remembering what Mrs. Newsome had done , it was as far as she went . He had sufficiently understood . "
202426	202564	202419	202419	YOU	0	" He took a moment to say , for , really and truly , what stood about him there in her offer - which was as the offer of exquisite service , of lightened care , for the rest of his days - might well have tempted . It built him softly round , it roofed him warmly over , it rested , all so firm , on selection . And what ruled selection was beauty and knowledge . It was awkward , it was almost stupid , not to seem to prize such things ; yet , none the less , so far as they made his opportunity they made it only for a moment . She 'd moreover understand - she always understood . That indeed might be , but meanwhile she was going on . "
202579	202580	202572	202572	I	0	" "
202587	202588	202584	202584	I	0	" "
202593	202597	202584	202584	I	0	" she repeated , "
202603	202604	202605	202605	I	0	" "
202619	202627	202615	202615	I	0	" He had got it at last . "
202632	202633	202615	202615	I	0	" "
202638	202656	202615	202615	I	0	" She had echoed it in vague deprecation , but he felt it already clear for her . "
202682	202686	202615	202615	I	0	" She thought . "
202700	202701	202692	202692	you	0	" "
202705	202710	202692	202692	you	0	" - he agreed . "
202725	202749	202718	202718	you	0	" Honest and fine , she could n't greatly pretend she did n't see it . Still she could pretend just a little . "
202759	202760	202753	202753	you	0	" "
202790	202806	202783	202783	I	0	" So then she had to take it , though still with her defeated protest . "
202830	202831	202820	202820	your	0	" "
202852	202866	202841	202841	You	0	" She sighed it at last all comically , all tragically , away . "
202874	202875	202867	202867	I	0	" "
