109	124	125	125	He	156	" All right , Mrs. Hopper ! How are you ? how are you ? "
141	156	125	125	He	156	" Dinner ready ? Savagely hungry . Give me three minutes , and serve . "
301	307	309	309	Will	159	" Now I can talk ! "
329	348	315	315	he	159	" What 's the news ? I seem to have been away three months rather than three weeks . "
349	392	509	509	Warburton	156	" Mr. Franks called yesterday , sir , late in the afternoon , when I was here cleaning . He was very glad to hear you 'd be back to - day , and said he might look in to - night . "
393	399	315	315	he	159	" Good ! What else ? "
400	455	509	509	Warburton	156	" My brother - in - law wishes to see you , sir . He 's in trouble again lost his place at Boxon 's a few days ago . I do n't exac'ly know how it happened , but he 'll explain everything . He 's very unfortunate , sir , is Allchin . "
456	472	315	315	he	159	" Tell him to come before nine to - morrow morning , if he can . "
473	490	509	509	Warburton	156	" Yes , sir . I 'm sure it 's very kind of you , sir . "
491	495	315	315	he	159	" What else ? "
496	508	509	509	Warburton	156	" Nothing as I can think of just now , sir . "
694	706	708	708	her	158	" Another accident , sir , I 'm sorry to say , "
712	715	691	691	her	158	" Extensive ? "
716	731	691	691	her	158	" A dish and two plates , I 'm sorry to say , sir . "
732	739	691	691	her	158	" Oh , that 's nothing . "
740	751	691	691	her	158	" Of course I shall make them good , sir . "
752	761	691	691	her	158	" Pooh ! Are n't there plates enough ? "
762	772	691	691	her	158	" Oh , quite enough just yet , sir . "
961	974	975	975	she	158	" My fingers is all gone silly to - day , sir , "
978	995	975	975	she	158	" I daresay it 's because I have n't had much sleep these last few nights . "
996	1001	1055	1055	Warburton	156	" How 's that ? "
1002	1054	975	975	she	158	" It 's my poor sister , sir my sister Liza , I mean she 's had one of her worst headaches the extra special , we call 'em . This time it 's lasted more than three days , and not one minute of rest has the poor thing got . "
1108	1120	1122	1122	Warburton	156	" Do you know of any place she could go to ? "
1127	1134	1122	1122	Warburton	156	" if the means were provided . "
1174	1200	1159	1159	she	158	" There 's a little lodging ' ouse at Southend , sir , where we used to go when my ' usband could afford it . "
1201	1237	1159	1159	she	158	" Well , look here . Get a doctor 's opinion whether Southend would do ; if not , which place would . And just send her away . Do n't worry about the money . "
1251	1260	1261	1261	Warburton	156	" How 's your other sister Mrs. Allchin ? "
1265	1327	1261	1261	Warburton	156	" Why , sir , she 's doing pretty well in her ' ealth , sir , but her baby died yesterday week . I hope you 'll excuse me , sir , for all this bad news just when you come back from your holiday , and when it 's natural as you do n't feel in very good spirits . "
1382	1390	1343	1344	Mrs. Hopper	158	" Ha ! That 's Mr. Franks . "
1401	1404	1343	1344	Mrs. Hopper	158	" Warburton ! "
1415	1423	1343	1344	Mrs. Hopper	158	" Have you seen The Art World ? "
1470	1489	1464	1464	he	320	" You have n't seen it ! Look here ! What d'you think of that , confound you ! "
1503	1506	1490	1490	He	320	" Sanctuary , "
1518	1541	1490	1490	He	320	" Is n't it good ? Does n't it come out well ? deuce take you , why do n't you speak ? "
1542	1549	1551	1551	Warburton	156	" Not bad for a photogravure , "
1569	1614	1490	1490	He	320	" Be hanged ! We know all about that . The thing is that it 's there . Do n't you feel any surprise ? Have n't you got anything to say ? Do n't you see what this means , you old ragamuffin ? "
1615	1631	1490	1490	He	320	" Should n't wonder if it meant coin of the realm for your shrewd dealer . "
1632	1684	1490	1490	He	320	" For me too , my boy , for me too ! Not out of this thing , of course . But I 've arrived , I 'm lance , the way is clear ! Why , you do n't seem to know what it means getting into The Art World . "
1685	1691	1693	1693	Warburton	156	" I seem to remember , "
1697	1720	1693	1693	Warburton	156	" that a month or two ago , you had n't language contemptuous enough for this magazine and all connected with it . "
1721	1728	1490	1490	He	320	" Do n't be an ass ! "
1747	1817	1490	1490	He	320	" Of course one talks like that when one has n't enough to eat and ca n't sell a picture . I do n't pretend to have altered my opinion about photogravures , and all that . But come now , the thing itself ? Be honest , Warburton . Is it bad , now ? Can you look at that picture , and say that it 's worthless ? "
1818	1827	1490	1490	He	320	" I never said anything of the kind . "
1828	1867	1490	1490	He	320	" No , no ! You 're too deucedly good - natured . But I always detected what you were thinking , and I saw it did n't surprise you at all when the Academy muffs refused it . "
1868	1874	1876	1876	Warburton	156	" There you 're wrong , "
1878	1884	1876	1876	Warburton	156	" I was really surprised . "
1885	1922	1490	1490	He	320	" Confound your impudence ! Well , you may think what you like . I maintain that the thing is n't half bad . It grows upon me . I see its merits more and more . "
1934	1936	1923	1923	Franks	160	" Sanctuary "
2042	2064	2031	2031	his	327	" If that had been hung at Burlington House , Warburton , it would have been the picture of the year . "
2065	2072	2017	2017	his	327	" I think it very likely . "
2073	2167	2031	2031	his	327	" Yes , I know what you mean , you sarcastic old ruffian . But there 's another point of view . Is the drawing good or not ? Is the colour good or not ? Of course you know nothing about it , but I tell you , for your information , I think it 's a confoundedly clever bit of work . There remains the subject , and where 's the harm in it ? The incident 's quite possible . And why should n't the girl be good - looking ? "
2168	2171	2017	2017	his	327	" Angelic ! "
2172	2190	2031	2031	his	327	" Well why not ? There are girls with angelic faces . Do n't I know one ? "
2211	2216	2217	2217	he	156	" That reminds me , "
2220	2229	2217	2217	he	156	" I came across the Pomfrets in Switzerland . "
2230	2235	2017	2017	his	327	" Where ? When ? "
2236	2259	2217	2217	he	156	" At Trient ten days ago . I spent three or four days with them . Has n't Miss Elvan mentioned it ? "
2260	2272	2274	2274	Franks	160	" I have n't heard from her for a long time , "
2276	2292	2274	2274	Franks	160	" Well , for more than a week . Did you meet them by chance ? "
2293	2312	2217	2217	he	156	" Quite . I had a vague idea that the Pomfrets and their niece were somewhere in Switzerland . "
2313	2317	2319	2320	the artist	329	" Vague idea ! "
2321	2349	2217	2217	he	156	" Why , I told you all about it , and growled for five or six hours one evening here because I could n't go with them . "
2350	2355	2357	2357	Warburton	156	" So you did , "
2359	2446	2357	2357	Warburton	156	" but I 'm afraid I was thinking of something else , and when I started for the Alps , I had really forgotten all about it . I made up my mind suddenly , you know . We 're having a troublesome time in Ailie Street , and it was holiday now or never . By the bye , we shall have to wind up . Sugar spells ruin . We must get out of it whilst we can do so with a whole skin . "
2447	2452	2454	2454	Franks	160	" Ah , really ? "
2456	2481	2454	2454	Franks	160	" Tell me about that presently ; I want to hear of Rosamund . You saw a good deal of her , of course ? "
2482	2556	2568	2569	the artist	329	" I walked from Chamonix over the Col de Balme grand view of Mont Blanc there ! Then down to Trient , in the valley below . And there , as I went in to dinner at the hotel , I found the three . Good old Pomfret would have me stay awhile , and I was glad of the chance of long talks with him . Queer old bird , Ralph Pomfret . "
2557	2566	2568	2569	the artist	329	" Yes , yes , so he is , "
2573	2581	2568	2569	the artist	329	" But Rosamund was she enjoying herself ? "
2582	2595	2568	2569	the artist	329	" Very much , I think . She certainly looked very well . "
2596	2603	2605	2605	Franks	160	" Have much talk with her ? "
2611	2629	2568	2569	the artist	329	" We discussed you , of course . I forget whether our conclusion was favourable or not . "
2646	2651	2652	2652	he	329	" You know what ? "
2666	2867	2652	2652	he	329	" I 'm going to be married before the end of the year . On that point I 've made up my mind . I went yesterday to see a house at Fulham Mrs. Cross 's , by the bye , it 's to let at Michaelmas , rent forty - five . All but settled that I shall take it . Risk be hanged . I 'm going to make money . What an ass I was to take that fellow 's first offer for ' Sanctuary ' ! It was low water with me , and I felt bilious . Fifty guineas ! Your fault , a good deal , you know ; you made me think worse of it than it deserved . You 'll see ; Blackstaffe'll make a small fortune out of it ; of course he has all the rights idiot that I was ! Well , it 's too late to talk about that . And I say , old man , do n't take my growl too literally . I do n't really mean that you were to blame . I should be an ungrateful cur if I thought such a thing . "
2868	2878	2880	2880	Warburton	156	" How 's ' The Slummer ' getting on ? "
2885	3120	2652	2652	he	329	" Well , I was going to say that I shall have it finished in a few weeks . If Blackstaffe wants ' The Slummer ' he 'll have to pay for it . Of course it must go to the Academy , and of course I shall keep all the rights unless Blackstaffe makes a really handsome offer . Why , it ought to be worth five or six hundred to me at least . And that would start us . But I do n't care even if I only get half that , I shall be married all the same . Rosamund has plenty of pluck . I could n't ask her to start life on a pound a week about my average for the last two years ; but with two or three hundred in hand , and a decent little house , like that of Mrs. Cross 's , at a reasonable rent well , we shall risk it . I 'm sick of waiting . And it is n't fair to a girl that 's my view . Two years now ; an engagement that lasts more than two years is n't likely to come to much good . You 'll think my behaviour pretty cool , on one point . I do n't forget , you old usurer , that I owe you something more than a hundred pounds "
3121	3124	2652	2652	he	329	" Pooh ! "
3125	3208	2652	2652	he	329	" Be poohed yourself ! But for you , I should have gone without dinner many a day ; but for you , I should most likely have had to chuck painting altogether , and turn clerk or dock - labourer . But let me stay in your debt a little longer , old man . I ca n't put off my marriage any longer , and just at first I shall want all the money I can lay my hands on . "
3258	3261	3262	3262	he	160	" No ! "
3265	3407	3262	3262	he	160	" I 'm not going to admit that ' Sanctuary ' is cheap and sentimental , and all the rest of it . The more I think about it , the more convinced I am that it 's nothing to be ashamed of . People have got hold of the idea that if a thing is popular it must be bad art . That 's all rot . I 'm going in for popularity . Look here ! Suppose that 's what I was meant for ? What if it 's the best I have in me to do ? Should n't I be a jackass if I scorned to make money by what , for me , was good work , and preferred to starve whilst I turned out pretentious stuff that was worth nothing from my point of view ? "
3408	3418	3420	3420	Warburton	156	" I should n't wonder if you 're right , "
3423	3474	3420	3420	Warburton	156	" In any case , I know as much about art as I do about the differential calculus . To make money is a good and joyful thing as long as one does n't bleed the poor . So go ahead , my son , and luck be with you ! "
3475	3556	3262	3262	he	160	" I ca n't find my model yet for the Slummer 's head . It must n't be too like the ' Sanctuary ' girl , but at the same time it must be a popular type of beauty . I 've been haunting refreshment bars and florists ' shops ; lots of good material , but never quite the thing . There 's a damsel at the Crystal Palace but this does n't interest you , you old misogynist . "
3557	3561	3563	3563	Warburton	156	" Old what ? "
3572	3587	3262	3262	he	160	" Have I got the word wrong ? I 'm not much of a classic "
3588	3606	3607	3608	The artist	329	" The word 's all right . But that 's your idea of me , is it ? "
3634	3640	3607	3608	The artist	329	" Is n't it true ? "
3641	3653	3607	3608	The artist	329	" Perhaps it is ; yes , yes , I daresay . "
4083	4093	4095	4095	he	159	" I do n't care how poor I am , "
4101	4194	4095	4095	he	159	" but I will be my own master . To be at other people 's orders brings out all the bad in me ; it makes me sullen and bearish , and all sorts of ugly things , which I certainly am not when my true self has play . So , you see , I must find some independent way of life . If I had to live by carrying round a Punch and Judy show , I should vastly prefer it to making a large income as somebody 's servant . "
4255	4260	4262	4262	he	159	" looking about him , "
4501	4508	4499	4499	he	177	" the life of a man . "
4737	4739	4728	4734	City men with first - hand information	372	" measures "
4766	4770	4772	4772	Sherwood	177	" Hold on ? "
4774	4865	4772	4772	Sherwood	177	" Of course I mean to hold on . There 's pleasure and honour in the thing . I enjoy the fight . I 've had thoughts of getting into Parliament , to speak for sugar . One might do worse , you know . There 'll be a dissolution next year , certain . First - rate fun , fighting a constituency . But in that case I must have a partner here why that 's an idea . How would it suit you ? Why not join me ? "
4944	4952	4954	4954	Godfrey	177	" It 's a disgrace to England ! "
4956	5046	4954	4954	Godfrey	177	" Monstrous that not a finger should be lifted to save one of our most important industries . You , of course , are free to retire at any moment , Will . For my own part , here I stand , come what may . If it 's ruin , ruin let it be . I 'll fight to the last . A man owes me ten thousand pounds . When I recover it , and I may any day I shall put every penny into the business . "
5047	5052	5054	5054	Warburton	176	" Ten thousand pounds ! "
5058	5067	5054	5054	Warburton	176	" A trade debt , do you mean ? "
5068	5129	4954	4954	Godfrey	177	" No , no . A friend of mine , son of a millionaire , who got into difficulties some time ago , and borrowed of me to clear himself . Good interest , and principal safe as Consols . In a year at most I shall have the money back , and every penny shall go into the business . "
5198	5204	5196	5196	they	374	" to fight the ship , "
5253	5365	5240	5240	he	177	" It 's all up with us , Will . This Government spells ruin , and will count it one of its chief glories if we come to grief . But , by Heaven , they sha n't have that joy . We 'll square up , quietly , comfortably , with dignity . We 'll come out of this fight with arms and baggage . It 's still possible , you know . We 'll sell the St. Kitts estate to the Germans . We 'll find some one to buy us up here the place would suit a brewer . And then by Jove ! we 'll make jam . "
5366	5369	5240	5240	he	177	" Jam ? "
5370	5504	5240	5240	he	177	" Is n't it an idea ? Cheap sugar has done for the refiners , but it 's a fortune for the jam trade . Why not put all we can realize into a jam factory ? We 'll go down into the country ; find some delightful place where land is cheap ; start a fruit farm ; run up a building . Does n't it take you , Will ? Think of going to business every day through lanes overhung with fruit - tree blossoms ! Better that than the filth and stench and gloom and uproar of Whitechapel what ? We might found a village for our workpeople the ideal village , perfectly healthy , every cottage beautiful . Eh ? What ? How does it strike you , Will ? "
5505	5512	5240	5240	he	177	" Pleasant . But the money ? "
5513	5539	5240	5240	he	177	" We shall have enough to start ; I think we shall . If not , we 'll find a moneyed man to join us . "
5540	5548	5240	5240	he	177	" What about that ten thousand pounds ? "
5557	5617	5554	5554	his	177	" Ca n't get it just yet . To tell you the truth , it depends on the death of the man 's father . No , but if necessary , some one will easily be found . Is n't the idea magnificent ? How it would rile the Government if they heard of it ! Ho , ho ! "
5904	5915	5896	5896	Sherwood	177	" Great opportunity in view . Our fortunes are made ! "

Meanwhile , you have the gratification of supporting a man of genius , without the least inconvenience to yourself . Excellent idea of yours to strike up a friendship , was n't it ? "

7940	7953	7918	7918	Franks	160	" And you did n't come to tell me about the Elvans ! "
7954	7964	7966	7966	Will	159	" About Miss Elvan , I suppose you mean ? "
7968	8036	7918	7918	Franks	160	" Well , yes , I do . I went there by chance this afternoon . The two men were away somewhere , I found Mrs. Pomfret and that girl alone together . Never had such a delightful time in my life ! But I say , Warburton , we must understand each other . Are you do you I mean , did she strike you particularly ? "
8045	8050	8052	8053	the other	404	" You mean that ? "
8057	8069	8052	8053	the other	404	" You really do n't care it 's nothing to you ? "
8070	8079	7918	7918	Franks	160	" Why , is it anything to you ? "
8080	8121	8052	8053	the other	404	" Anything ? Rosamund Elvan is the most beautiful girl I ever saw , and the sweetest , and the brightest , and the altogether flooringest ! And , by heaven and earth , I 'm resolved to marry her ! "

9337	9343	9291	9292	the other	404	" And how 's that ? "
9344	9517	9318	9318	His	404	" It happened last Saturday , sir . I do n't want to make out as I was n't at all to blame . I know as well as anybody that I 've got a will of my own . But we 're open late , as perhaps you know , sir , on Saturday night , and Mr. Boxon well , it 's only the truth he 's never quite himself after ten o'clock . I 'd worked from eight in the morning to something past midnight of course I do n't think nothing of that , 'cause it 's reg'lar in the trade . But well , in come a customer , sir , a woman as did n't rightly know what she wanted ; and she went out without buying , and Mr. Boxon he see it , and he come up to me and calls me the foulest name he could turn his tongue to . And so well , sir , there was unpleasantness , as they say "
9531	9540	9291	9292	the other	404	" A quarrel , in fact , eh ? "
9541	9551	9291	9292	the other	404	" It did about come to that , sir ! "
9552	9561	9291	9292	the other	404	" You lost your temper , of course . "
9562	9571	9291	9292	the other	404	" That 's about the truth , sir . "
9572	9579	9291	9292	the other	404	" And Boxon turned you out ? "
9584	9630	9291	9292	the other	404	" Well , sir , I 've no doubt he 'd have liked to , but I was a bit beforehand with him . When I see him last , he was settin ' on the pavement , sir , rubbin ' his ' ead . "
9645	9670	9291	9292	the other	404	" I 'm afraid that kind of thing wo n't do , Allchin . You 'll be in serious trouble one of these days . "
9671	9709	9291	9292	the other	404	" That 's what my wife says , sir . I know well enough as it 's hard on her , just after we 've lost the baby as perhaps Mrs. Hopper'll have told you , sir . "
9710	9721	9291	9292	the other	404	" I was very sorry to hear it , Allchin . "
9722	9930	9291	9292	the other	404	" Thank you , sir . You 've always something kind to say . And I 'm that vexed , because I was getting on well with paying my debts . But Mr. Boxon , sir , he 's many a time made me that mad that I 've gone out into the back yard and kicked the wall till my toes were sore , just to ease my feelings , like . To tell the truth , sir , I do n't think he 's ever rightly sober , and I 've heard others say the same . And his business is fallin ' off , something shockin ' . Customers do n't like to be insulted ; that 's only natural . He 's always going down to Kempton Park , or Epsom , or some such place . They do say as he lost ' undreds of pounds at Kempton Park last week . It 's my opinion the shop ca n't go on much longer . Well , sir , I thought I just ought to come and tell you the truth of things , and I wo n't disturb you no longer . I shall do my best to find another place . "
9969	9973	9974	9974	he	508	" All right , "
9978	9987	9974	9974	he	508	" let me know how you get on . "
10008	10021	10022	10022	Warburton	176	" I suppose they have a little money to go on with ? "
10025	10036	10022	10022	Warburton	176	" I mean , enough for a week or so . "
10037	10096	10022	10022	Warburton	176	" Yes , I think they have that , sir . But I see how it 'll be . My poor sister'll end in the work'us . Allchin'll never keep a place . Not that I can blame him , sir , for givin ' it to that Boxon , 'cause every one says he 's a brute . "
10097	10145	10022	10022	Warburton	176	" Well , just let me know if they begin to be in want . But of course Allchin can always get work as a porter . He must learn to keep his fists down , if he does n't want to be perpetually out of employment . "
10146	10183	10022	10022	Warburton	176	" That 's what I tell him , sir . And my poor sister , sir , she 's never stopped talkin ' to him , day or night you may say , ever since it happened "
10184	10188	10192	10192	himself	176	" Merciful Heavens ! "
10207	10217	10219	10219	Will	159	" Mr. Sherwood not here yet , I suppose ? "
10221	10230	10232	10233	the manager	513	" Oh yes , he is , sir , "
10235	10243	10232	10233	the manager	513	" been here for half an hour . "
10285	10291	10292	10292	he	177	" How do , Will ? "
10303	10416	10292	10292	he	177	" Did you ever read ' The Adventures of a Younger Son ' ? Oh , you must . Listen here . He 's describing how he thrashed an assistant master at school ; thrashed him , he says , till ' the sweat dropped from his brows like rain - drops from the eaves of a pig - sty ! ' Ho - ho - ho ! What do you think of that for a comparison ? Is n't it strong ? By Jove ! a bracing book ! Trelawny , you know ; the friend of Byron . As breezy a book as I know . It does one good . "
10473	10478	10479	10479	he	177	" Enjoyed your holiday ? "
10495	10578	10479	10479	he	177	" You look well . Done any summits ? When we get our affairs in order , I must be off somewhere myself . Northward , I think . I want a little bracing cold . I should like to see Iceland . You know the Icelandic sagas ? Magnificent ! There 's the saga of Grettir the Strong by Jove ! But come , this is n't business . I have news for you , real , substantial , hopeful news . "
10592	10654	10587	10587	Will	159	" You know my thoughts were running on jam ; jam is our salvation ; of that I have long been convinced . I looked about , made a few inquiries , and by good luck , not long after you went off for your holiday , met just the man I wanted . You 've heard of Applegarth 's jams ? "
10663	10940	10657	10657	he	159	" Well , I came across Applegarth himself . I was talking to Linklater and jams came up . ' You ought to see my friend Applegarth , ' said he ; and he arranged for us to meet . Applegarth happened to be in town , but he lives down in Somerset , and his factory is at Bristol . We all dined together at the Junior Carlton , and Applegarth and I got on so well that he asked me down to his place . Oxford man , clever , a fine musician , and an astronomer ; has built himself a little observatory magnificent telescope . By Jove ! you should hear him handle the violin . Astonishing fellow ! Not much of a talker ; rather dry in his manner ; but no end of energy , bubbling over with vital force . He began as a barrister , but could n't get on , and saw his capital melting . ' Hang it ! ' said he , ' I must make some use of what money I have ' ; and he thought of jam . Brilliant idea ! He began in a very modest way , down at Bristol , only aiming at local trade . But his jams were good ; the demand grew ; he built a factory ; profits became considerable . And now , he wants to withdraw from active business , keeping an interest . Wants to find some one who would run and extend the concern put in a fair capital , and leave him to draw his income quietly . You see ? "
10941	10947	10949	10949	Warburton	176	" Seems a good opportunity , "
10951	11024	11025	11025	He	518	" Good ? It 's simply superb . He took me over the works a really beautiful sight , everything so admirably arranged . Then we had more private talk . Of course I spoke of you , said I could do nothing till we had consulted together . I did n't seem too eager not good policy . But we 've had some correspondence , and you shall see the letters . "
11046	11050	11051	11051	he	518	" Of course , "
11054	11067	11051	11051	he	518	" I could only stand for a very small part in this . "
11068	11085	11086	11086	Sherwood	177	" Well , we must talk about that . To tell you the truth , Will , "
11100	11194	11094	11094	his	177	" I do n't see my way to find the whole capital , and yet I do n't want to bring in a stranger . Applegarth could sell to a company any moment , but that is n't his idea ; he wants to keep the concern in as few hands as possible . He has a first - rate manager ; the mere jam - making would n't worry us at all ; and the office work is largely a matter of routine . Will you take time to think about it ? "
11276	11280	11281	11281	he	177	" I suppose , "
11285	11301	11281	11281	he	177	" this affair has about as little risk as anything one could put money in ? "
11302	11307	11308	11308	Godfrey	177	" I should say , "
11320	11395	11281	11281	he	177	" that the element of risk is non - existent . What can be more solid than jam ? There 's competition to be sure ; but Applegarth is already a good name throughout England , and in the West they swear by it . At Bristol , Exeter , Dorchester all over there Applegarth holds the field . Very seriously speaking , I see in this proposal nothing but sure and increasing gain . "
11396	11405	11406	11406	Will	159	" You know as well as I do , "
11409	11433	11406	11406	Will	159	" how I stand . I have no resources of my own beyond what you are aware of . But I 've been thinking "
11458	11470	11471	11471	Will	159	" It 's my mother and sister I have in mind , "
11474	11549	11471	11471	Will	159	" That property of theirs ; it brings them about a hundred and fifty pounds a year in cash , and three times that in worry . At any moment they might sell . A man at St. Neots offers four thousand pounds ; I suspect more might be got if Turnbull , their lawyer , took the matter in hand . Suppose I advise them to sell and put the money in Applegarth ? "
11550	11554	11556	11556	Sherwood	177	" By Jove ! "
11558	11568	11556	11556	Sherwood	177	" How could they do better ? Splendid idea ! "
11569	11634	11471	11471	Will	159	" Yes if all goes well . Bear in mind , on the other hand , that if they lost this money , they would have nothing to live upon , or as good as nothing . They draw some fifty pounds a year from another source , and they have their own house that 's all . Ought I to take this responsibility ? "
11635	11643	11645	11645	Sherwood	177	" I do n't hesitate to guarantee , "
11651	11684	11645	11645	Sherwood	177	" that in two years ' time their four thousand pounds shall produce three times what it does now . Only think , my dear fellow ! Jam think what it means ! "
11701	11710	11712	11712	Will	159	" I shall run down to St. Neots , "
11716	11825	11834	11835	the manager	513	" Do . And then we 'll both of us go down to Bristol . I 'm sure you 'll like Applegarth . By the bye , you never went in for astronomy , did you ? I felt ashamed of my ignorance . Why , it 's one of the most interesting subjects a man can study . I shall take it up . One might have a little observatory of one 's own . Do you know Bristol at all ? A beastly place , the town , but perfectly delightful country quite near at hand . Applegarth lives in an ideal spot you 'll see . "
12477	12571	12470	12475	the landlady , who smiled recognition	549	" No , sir , Mr. Franks is n't at home , and has n't been since after breakfast this morning . And I do n't understand it ; because he told me last night that he 'd be working all day , and I was to get meals for him as usual . And at ten o'clock the model came that rough man he 's putting into the new picture , you know , sir ; and I had to send him away , when he 'd waited more than an hour . "
12576	12585	12586	12586	he	156	" I 'll take my turn at waiting , "
12589	12602	12586	12586	he	156	" Will you please light the gas for me in the studio ? "
12688	12691	12693	12693	his	329	" The Slummer "
12866	12876	12882	12882	she	563	" I 'm afraid he 's worried about her , "
12896	12937	12882	12882	she	563	" He ca n't find a model good - looking enough . I say to Mr. Franks why not make it the portrait of his own young lady ? I 'm sure she 's good - looking enough for anything and "
13027	13038	13141	13142	the landlady	563	" Hallo ! What the deuce has he been doing ? "
13039	13045	13047	13048	the landlady	563	" Well , I never ! "
13050	13069	13047	13048	the landlady	563	" It must be himself that 's done it ! What does that mean now , I wonder ? "
13088	13092	13093	13093	he	156	" I daresay , "
13102	13131	13093	13093	he	156	" the portrait had begun to vex him . He 's often spoken of it discontentedly , and talked of painting another . It was n't very good . "
13315	13329	13313	13313	Franks	160	" Ah ! Here you are ! I waited as long as I could "
13330	13337	13339	13340	the artist	329	" I 'll walk with you , "
13367	13374	13339	13340	the artist	329	" What 's wrong , Franks ? "
13375	13389	13339	13340	the artist	329	" As you 've been in the studio , I daresay you know . "
13390	13398	13339	13340	the artist	329	" I saw something that surprised me . "
13399	13405	13407	13407	Norbert	160	" Did it surprise you ? "
13416	13424	13426	13426	Will	159	" What do you mean by that ? "
13474	13488	13490	13490	Will	159	" Of course , if you do n't care to talk about it , "
13495	13504	13505	13505	Franks	160	" I 've been walking about all day , "
13508	13556	13505	13505	Franks	160	" and I 've got hell inside me ; I 'd rather not have met you to - night , that 's the truth . But I ca n't let you go without asking a plain question . Did it surprise you to see that portrait smashed ? "
13557	13567	13616	13616	Franks	160	" Very much . What do you hint at ? "
13568	13599	13505	13505	Franks	160	" I had a letter this morning from Rosamund , saying she could n't marry me , and that all must be over between us . Does that surprise you ? "
13600	13615	13616	13616	Franks	160	" Yes , it does . Such a possibility had never entered my mind . "
13631	13641	13642	13642	he	160	" I 've no choice but to believe you , "
13647	13686	13642	13642	he	160	" And no doubt I 'm making a fool of myself . That 's why I shot out of your way this afternoon I wanted to wait till I got calmer . Let 's say good - night . "
13687	13693	13695	13695	Warburton	156	" You 're tired out , "
13697	13768	13695	13695	Warburton	156	" Do n't go any farther this way , but let me walk back with you I wo n't go in . I ca n't leave you in this state of mind . Of course I begin to see what you mean , and a wilder idea never got into any man 's head . Whatever the explanation of what has happened , I have nothing to do with it . "
13769	13779	13642	13642	he	160	" You say so , and I believe you . "
13780	13845	13695	13695	Warburton	156	" Which means , that you do n't . I sha n't cut up rough ; you 're not yourself , and I can make all allowances . Think over what I 've said , and come and have another talk . Not to - morrow ; I have to go down to St. Neots . But the day after , in the evening . "
13846	13854	13642	13642	he	160	" Very well . Good - night . "
14002	14022	13987	13987	he	159	" Well , Sam , how goes it ? Everybody flourishing ? Drive first to Mr. Turnbull 's office . "
14106	14134	14079	14079	he	195	" I 'm on my way to The Haws , Mr. Turnbull , and wanted to ask if you could come up and see us this evening ? "
14135	14141	14143	14144	the lawyer	588	" Oh , with pleasure , "
14156	14163	14146	14146	his	588	" You may count on me . "
14164	14192	14146	14146	his	588	" We 're winding up at Sherwood 's . I do n't mean in bankruptcy ; but that would n't be far off if we kept going . "
14193	14202	14204	14205	Mr. Turnbull	195	" Ah ! I can well understand that , "
14253	14266	14204	14205	Mr. Turnbull	195	" I have a project I should like to talk over with you "
14267	14270	14272	14273	the lawyer	588	" Ah ? "
14276	14284	14204	14205	Mr. Turnbull	195	" As it concerns my mother and Jane "
14285	14288	14290	14291	Mr. Turnbull	195	" Ah ? "
14297	14312	14204	14205	Mr. Turnbull	195	" Then we shall expect you . Will it rain , do you think ? "
14313	14341	14204	14205	Mr. Turnbull	195	" I fear so . The glass is very low indeed . It would n't surprise me if we had rain through the whole month of August . "
14342	14350	14352	14352	Will	159	" Good Heavens ! I hope not , "
14489	14492	14494	14494	Will	159	" Sam , "
14504	14524	14494	14494	Will	159	" I do n't think I shall pay for this drive . You 're much richer than I am . "
14525	14531	14538	14538	Sam	200	" Very good , sir , "
14555	14562	14551	14553	young Mr. Warburton	156	" As you please , sir . "
14563	14577	14637	14637	He	159	" You could n't lend me half - a - crown , Sam ? "
14578	14592	14551	14553	young Mr. Warburton	156	" I daresay I could , sir , if you really wanted it . "
14593	14597	14637	14637	He	159	" Do then . "
14615	14636	14637	14637	He	159	" After all , Sam , perhaps I 'd better pay . Your wife might grumble . Here you are . "
14658	14675	14551	14553	young Mr. Warburton	156	" Well , what 's the matter ? Do n't you say thank you , nowadays ? "
14676	14692	14637	14637	He	159	" Yes , sir thank you , sir it 's all right , Mr. Will . "
14693	14717	14551	14553	young Mr. Warburton	156	" I should think it is indeed . Be here to - morrow morning , to catch the 6.30 up train , Sam . "
14797	14808	14810	14810	Will	159	" Of course , you got my letter this morning ? "
14812	14815	14752	14752	her	604	" Yes . "
14816	14826	14765	14765	She	604	" Mr. Turnbull is coming up to - night . "
14827	14834	14836	14836	Jane	202	" I 'm glad of that , "
14849	14905	14765	14765	She	604	" Of course he 'll prophesy disaster , and plunge you both into the depths of discouragement . But I do n't mind that . I feel so confident myself that I want some one to speak on the other side . He 'll have to make inquiries , of course . Where 's mother ? "
15039	15048	15050	15050	her	176	" Come and look at the orange lilies , "
15058	15066	15050	15050	her	176	" They 've never been so fine . "
15067	15073	15075	15075	Jane	202	" But notice Pompey first , "
15077	15086	15075	15075	Jane	202	" He 'll be offended in a minute . "
15147	15153	15155	15156	the visitor	317	" Hallo , old Magnus ! "
15163	15173	15155	15156	the visitor	317	" Come along with us and see the lilies . "
15420	15432	15434	15434	Jane	202	" It 'll be a good thing for you as well , "
15436	15489	15434	15434	Jane	202	" Yes , it comes just in time . Sherwood knew what he was doing ; now and then I 've thought he was risking too much , but he 's a clear - headed fellow . The way he has kept things going so long in Ailie Street is really remarkable . "
15490	15502	15504	15505	Mrs. Warburton	176	" I daresay you had your share in that , Will , "
15507	15601	15434	15434	Jane	202	" A very small one ; my work has never been more than routine . I do n't pretend to be a man of business . If it had depended upon me , the concern would have fallen to pieces years ago , like so many others . House after house has gone down ; our turn must have come very soon . As it is , we shall clear out with credit , and start afresh gloriously . By the bye , do n't get any but Applegarth 's jams in future . "
15602	15606	15608	15608	Jane	202	" That depends , "
15611	15617	15608	15608	Jane	202	" if we like them . "
15722	15726	15727	15727	he	159	" at home , "
15753	15759	15761	15761	Jane	202	" What 's the matter ? "
15769	15824	15761	15761	Jane	202	" Oh , nothing a stupid affair . I wrote to you about the Pomfrets and their niece . I 'm afraid that girl is an idiot . She used the opportunity of her absence , I find , to break with Franks . No excuse whatever ; simply sent him about his business . "
15825	15828	15761	15761	Jane	202	" Oh ! "
15859	15905	15761	15761	Jane	202	" Of course , I do n't know much about it . But it looks bad . Perhaps it 's the best thing that could have happened to Franks , for it may mean that he has n't made money fast enough to please her . "
15906	15918	15920	15921	his mother	346	" But you gave us quite another idea of Miss Elvan , "
15923	15943	15761	15761	Jane	202	" Yes , I daresay I did . Who knows ? I do n't pretend to understand such things . "
17061	17070	17072	17072	her	663	" Come and help to pick scarlet runners , "
17079	17085	17072	17072	her	663	" Are n't they magnificent ? "
17111	17115	17117	17117	Will	159	" Splendid crop ! "
17123	17132	17135	17136	his sister	663	" Does n't the scent do one good ? "
17138	17169	17135	17136	his sister	663	" When I come into the garden on a morning like this , I have a feeling oh , I ca n't describe it to you perhaps you would n't understand "
17170	17174	17176	17176	Will	159	" I know , "
17180	17218	17135	17136	his sister	663	" It 's as if nature were calling out to me , like a friend , to come and admire and enjoy what she has done . I feel grateful for the things that earth offers me . "
17279	17290	17291	17291	she	202	" There 'll be an end of mother 's worry , "
17294	17362	17291	17291	she	202	" and I ca n't tell you how glad I shall be . It seems to me that women ought n't to have to think about money , and mother hates the name of it ; she always has done . Oh , what a blessing when it 's all off our hands ! We should n't care , even if the new arrangement brought us less . "
17363	17373	17375	17375	Will	159	" And it is certain to bring you more , "
17377	17382	17375	17375	Will	159	" perhaps considerably more . "
17383	17407	17291	17291	she	202	" Well , I sha n't object to that ; there are lots of uses for money ; but it does n't matter . "
17434	17442	17444	17444	Will	159	" Here , let me do that , "
17448	17460	17414	17414	She	202	" You ? Well then , as a very great favour . "
17461	17481	17414	17414	She	202	" Of course I mean that . It 's grand to turn up potatoes . What sort are these ? "
17482	17488	17490	17490	Jane	202	" Pink - eyed flukes , "
17498	17506	17490	17490	Jane	202	" We have n't touched them yet . "
17507	17512	17414	17414	She	202	" Mealy , eh ? "
17513	17518	17490	17490	Jane	202	" Balls of flour ! "
17589	17599	17601	17601	Jane	202	" That means the milk - boy is here , "
17603	17621	17601	17601	Jane	202	" Pompey always goes to meet him in the morning . Come and drink a glass warm . "
17790	17800	17802	17802	Will	159	" If you had n't come to - night , "
17804	17812	17802	17802	Will	159	" I should have looked you up . "
17823	17831	17832	17832	he	160	" I ought to have come before , "
17840	17871	17832	17832	he	160	" That night when I met you , I made a fool of myself . For one thing , I was drunk , and I 've been drunk ever since . "
17872	17882	17884	17884	Will	159	" Ha ! That accounts for your dirty collar , "
17893	17898	17900	17901	the other	404	" Is it dirty ? "
17910	17930	17900	17901	the other	404	" What does it matter ? A little dirt more or less , in a world so full of it "
17957	17965	17967	17968	the artist	329	" You are not extravagant in sympathy , "
17975	18046	17937	17937	he	160	" If I were , would it do you any good , old fellow ? Look here , are we to talk of this affair or not ? Just as you like . For my part , I 'd rather talk about ' The Slummer . ' I had a look at it the other day . Uncommonly good , the blackguard on the curbstone , you 've got him . "
18047	18052	18053	18053	Franks	160	" You think so ? "
18065	18084	18053	18053	Franks	160	" Yes , not bad , I think . But who knows whether I shall finish the thing . "
18085	18091	18093	18094	his friend	321	" If you do n't , "
18105	18142	18093	18094	his friend	321	" you 'll do something better . But I should finish it , if I were you . If you had the courage to paint in the right sort of face the girl , you know . "
18143	18151	17937	17937	he	160	" What sort of face , then ? "
18152	18175	18093	18094	his friend	321	" Sharp - nosed , thin - lipped , rather anaemic , with a universe of self - conceit in the eye . "
18176	18246	18247	18247	He	321	" They would n't hang it , and nobody would buy it . Besides , Warburton , you 're wrong if you think the slummers are always that sort . Still , I 'm not sure I sha n't do it , out of spite . There 's another reason , too I hate beautiful women ; I do n't think I shall ever be able to paint another . "
18267	18272	18273	18273	Franks	160	" I 've confessed , "
18280	18325	18273	18273	Franks	160	" that I made a fool of myself the other night . But I wish you 'd tell me something about your time at Trient . Did n't you notice anything ? Did n't anything make you suspect what she was going to do ? "
18326	18335	18337	18337	Will	159	" I never for a moment foresaw it , "
18343	18374	18093	18094	his friend	321	" Yet she must have made up her mind whilst you were there . Her astounding hypocrisy ! I had a letter a few days before , the same as usual "
18375	18380	18273	18273	Franks	160	" Quite the same ? "
18381	18519	18093	18094	his friend	321	" Absolutely ! Well , there was no difference that struck me . Then all at once she declares that for months she had felt her position false and painful . What a monstrous thing ! Why did she go on pretending , playing a farce ? I could have sworn that no girl lived who was more thoroughly honest in word and deed and thought . It 's awful to think how one can be deceived . I understand now the novels about unfaithful wives , and all that kind of thing . I always said to myself ' Pooh , as if a fellow would n't know if his wife were deceiving him ' ! By Jove this has made me afraid of the thought of marriage . I shall never again trust a woman . "
18529	18657	18658	18658	He	674	" Of course , she 's ashamed to face me . For fear I should run after her , she wrote that they were just leaving Trient for another place , not mentioned . If I wrote , I was to address to Bath , and the letter would be forwarded . I wrote of course a fool 's letter ; I only wish I 'd never sent it . Sometimes I think I 'll never try to see her again ; sometimes I think I 'll make her see me , and tell her the truth about herself . The only thing is I 'm half afraid I 've gone through torture enough ; I do n't want to begin again . Yet if I saw her "
18672	18693	18658	18658	He	674	" Tell me honestly what you think about it . I want advice . What 's your opinion of her ? "
18694	18712	18658	18658	He	674	" I have no opinion at all . I do n't pretend to know her well enough . "
18713	18718	18720	18720	Franks	160	" Well , but , "
18722	18735	18720	18720	Franks	160	" your impression your feeling . How does the thing strike you ? "
18736	18749	18658	18658	He	674	" Why , disagreeably enough ; that 's a matter of course . "
18750	18757	18759	18759	Norbert	160	" You do n't excuse her ? "
18768	18773	18658	18658	He	674	" I can imagine excuses "
18774	18788	18658	18658	He	674	" What ? What excuse can there be for deliberate hypocrisy , treachery ? "
18789	18795	18797	18797	Warburton	176	" If it was deliberate , "
18799	18895	18797	18797	Warburton	176	" there 's nothing to be said . In your position since you ask advice I should try to think that it was n't , but that the girl had simply changed her mind , and went on and on , struggling with herself till she could stand it no longer . I 've no taste for melodrama quiet comedy is much more in my line comedy ending with mutual tolerance and forgiveness . To be sure , if you feel you ca n't live without her , if you 're determined to fight for her "
18896	18901	18903	18903	Franks	160	" Fight with whom ? "
18905	19042	18797	18797	Warburton	176	" With her ; then read Browning , and blaze away . It may be the best ; who can tell ? Only on this point I am clear no self - deception ! Do n't go in for heroics just because they seem fine . Settle with yourself whether she is indispensable to you or not . Indispensable ? why , no woman is that to any man ; sooner or later , it 's a matter of indifference . And if you feel , talking plainly with yourself , that the worst is over already , that it does n't after all matter as much as you thought ; why , get back to your painting . If you can paint only ugly women , so much the better , I 've no doubt . "
19051	19075	19048	19048	he	160	" All that is sensible enough . But , if I give her up , I shall marry some one else straight away . "
19310	19325	19327	19329	the afflicted woman	690	" I 'm sure I 've , always wished to make your life happy , "
19331	19336	19337	19337	he	472	" And I yours , "
19358	19366	19351	19351	he	472	" Take the will for the deed . "
19521	19523	19498	19499	a lodger	699	" respectable "
19546	19548	19498	19499	a lodger	699	" respectable "
19692	19694	19695	19695	one	2293	" kept "
19739	19742	19695	19695	one	2293	" generals . "
20072	20086	20088	20088	Bertha	183	" If only you could see the comical side of it , mother , "
20090	20184	20088	20088	Bertha	183	" It really has one , you know . Emma , if only you would be patient with her , is a well - meaning creature , and she says the funniest things . I asked her this morning if she did n't think she could find some way of remembering to put the salt on the table . And she looked at me very solemnly , and said , ' Indeed , I will , miss . I 'll put it into my prayers , just after ' our daily bread . ' "
20223	20233	20235	20236	the girl	2296	" Look at it in this way , mother , "
20247	20339	20235	20236	the girl	2296	" To be badly served is bad enough , in itself ; why make it worse by ceaseless talking about it , so leaving ourselves not a moment of peace and quiet ? I 'm sure I 'd rather put the salt on the table myself at every meal , and think no more about it , than worry , worry , worry over the missing salt - cellars from one meal to the next . Do n't you feel , dear mother , that it 's shocking waste of life ? "
20340	20398	20400	20401	Mrs. Cross	174	" What nonsense you talk , child ! Are we to live in dirt and disorder ? Am I never to correct a servant , or teach her her duties ? But of course everything I do is wrong . Of course you could do everything so very much better . That 's what children are nowadays . "
20854	20858	20860	20861	Mrs. Cross	174	" How vexatious ! "
20863	20887	20860	20861	Mrs. Cross	174	" I had very much rather have let to people we know I suppose he 's seen a house that suits him better . "
20888	20896	20898	20898	Bertha	183	" I think there 's another reason , "
20914	20921	20898	20898	Bertha	183	" The marriage is put off . "
20922	20928	20930	20931	her mother	716	" And you knew that , "
20933	21046	20930	20931	her mother	716	" all the time , and never told me ! And I might have missed twenty chances of letting . Really , Bertha , I never did see anything like you . There 's that house standing empty month after month , and we hardly know where to turn for money , and you knew that Mr. Franks would n't take it , and yet you say not a word ! How can you behave in such an extraordinary way ? I think you really find pleasure in worrying me . Any one would fancy you wished to see me in my grave . To think that you knew all the time ! "
21168	21221	21163	21163	she	183	" We shall be quite alone Mr. and Mrs. Capron are going to town immediately after lunch . This is a lovely place , and we shall have it to ourselves all the afternoon . So do n't be frightened I know how you hate strangers but come , come , come ! "
21310	21390	21286	21296	a slim , prettily - dressed girl who ran towards her	742	" My dear , dear old Bertha ! What a happiness to see you again ! How good of you to come ! Is n't it a lovely place ? And the nicest people . You 've heard me speak of Miss Anderton , of Bath . She is Mrs. Capron married half a year ago . And they 're just going to Egypt for a year , and what do you think ? I 'm going with them . "
21422	21426	21398	21398	She	167	" To Egypt ? "
21427	21493	21398	21398	She	167	" Yes . It was decided whilst I was in Switzerland . Mrs. Capron wants a friend to be with her ; one who can help her in water - colours . She thought , of course , that I could n't go ; wrote to me just wishing it were possible . And I caught at the chance ! Oh , caught at it ! "
21494	21503	21505	21505	Bertha	183	" That 's what I do n't understand , "
21507	21680	21684	21684	her	743	" I want to explain it all . Come into this cosy corner . Nobody will disturb us except when they bring tea . Do you know that picture of Leader 's ? Is n't it exquisite ! Are you tired , Bertha ? You look so , a little . I 'm afraid you walked from the station , and it 's such a hot day . But oh , the loveliness of the trees about here ! Do you remember our first walk together ? You were shy , stiff ; did n't feel quite sure whether you liked me or not . And I thought you just a little critical . But before we got back again , I think we had begun to understand each other . And I wonder whether you 'll understand me now . It would be dreadful if I felt you disapproved of me . Of course if you do , I 'd much rather you said so . You will wo n't you ? "
21695	21703	21705	21706	the other	404	" Whether I say it or not , "
21708	21722	21705	21706	the other	404	" you 'll see what I think . I never could help that . "
21723	21802	21681	21681	She	743	" That 's what I love in you ! And that 's what I 've been thinking of , all these weeks of misery your perfect sincerity . I 've asked myself whether it would be possible for you to find yourself in such a position as mine ; and how you would act , how you would speak . You 're my ideal of truth and rightness , Bertha ; I 've often enough told you that . "
21811	21821	21822	21822	she	183	" Suppose you just tell me what has happened , "
21826	21846	21705	21706	the other	404	" Yes , I will . I hope you have n't been thinking it was some fault of his ? "
21847	21855	21681	21681	She	743	" I could n't help thinking that . "
21856	21932	21705	21706	the other	404	" Oh ! Put that out of your mind at once . The fault is altogether mine . He has done nothing whatever he is good and true , and all that a man should be . It 's I who am behaving badly ; so badly that I feel hot with shame now that I come to tell you . I have broken it off . I 've said I could n't marry him . "
21966	21976	21977	21977	she	183	" I 've seen it coming since last Christmas , "
21987	22139	21977	21977	she	183	" You know he came down to Bath ; that was our last meeting ; and I felt that something was wrong . Ah , so hard to know oneself ! I wanted to talk to you about it ; but then I said to myself what can Bertha do but tell me to know my own mind ? And that 's just what I could n't come to , to understand my own feelings . I was changing , I knew that . I dreaded to look into my own thoughts , from day to day . Above all , I dreaded to sit down and write to him . Oh , the hateful falsity of those letters Yet what could I do , what could I do ? I had no right to give such a blow , unless I felt that anything else was utterly , utterly impossible . "
22140	22149	22346	22346	her	183	" And at last you did feel it ? "
22150	22301	21977	21977	she	183	" In Switzerland yes . It came like a flash of lightning . I was walking up that splendid valley you remember my description up toward the glacier . That morning I had had a letter , naming the very day for our marriage , and speaking of the house your house at Putney he meant to take . I had said to myself ' It must be ; I can do nothing . I have n't the courage . ' Then , as I was walking , a sort of horror fell upon me , and made me tremble ; and when it passed I saw that , so far from not having the courage to break , I should never dare to go through with it . And I went back to the hotel , and sat down and wrote , without another moment 's thought or hesitation . "
22302	22310	22312	22312	Bertha	183	" What else could you have done ? "
22320	22329	22312	22312	Bertha	183	" When it comes to horror and tremblings ! "
22375	22381	22382	22382	she	183	" Have patience with me , "
22385	22511	22382	22382	she	183	" whilst I try to explain it all . The worst of my position is , that so many people will know what I have done , and so few of them , hardly any one , will understand why . One ca n't talk to people about such things . Even Winnie and father I 'm sure they do n't really understand though I 'm afraid they 're both rather glad . What a wretched thing it is to be misjudged . I feel sure , Bertha , that it 's just this kind of thing that makes a woman sit down and write a novel where she can speak freely in disguise , and do herself justice . Do n't you think so ? "
22512	22518	22520	22521	the listener	746	" I should n't wonder , "
22525	22544	22520	22521	the listener	746	" But does it really matter ? If you know you 're only doing what you must do ? "
22545	22619	22382	22382	she	183	" But that 's only how it seems to me . Another , in my place , would very likely see the must on the other side . Of course it 's a terribly complicated thing a situation like this . I have n't the slightest idea how one ought to be guided . One could argue and reason all day long about it as I have done with myself for weeks past . "
22620	22635	22637	22637	Bertha	183	" Try just to tell me the reason which seems to you the strongest , "
22639	22658	22382	22382	she	183	" That 's very simple . I thought I loved him , and I find I do n't . "
22659	22672	22382	22382	she	183	" Exactly . But I hardly see how the change came about . "
22673	22681	22683	22683	Rosamund	167	" I will try to tell you , "
22685	23114	22683	22683	Rosamund	167	" It was that picture , ' Sanctuary , ' that began it . When I first saw it , it gave me a shock . You know how I have always thought of him an artist living for his own idea of art , painting just as he liked , what pleased him , without caring for the public taste . I got enthusiastic ; and when I saw that he seemed to care for my opinion and my praise of course all the rest followed . He told me about his life as an art student Paris , Rome , all that ; and it was my ideal of romance . He was very poor , sometimes so poor that he hardly had enough to eat , and this made me proud of him , for I felt sure he could have got money if he would have condescended to do inferior work . Of course , as I too was poor , we could not think of marrying before his position improved . At last he painted ' Sanctuary . ' He told me nothing about it . I came and saw it on the easel , nearly finished . And this is the shocking thing I pretended to admire it . I was astonished , pained yet I had the worldliness to smile and praise . There 's the fault of my character . At that moment , truth and courage were wanted , and I had neither . The dreadful thing is to think that he degraded himself on my account . If I had said at once what I thought , he would have confessed would have told me that impatience had made him untrue to himself . And from that day ; oh , this is the worst of all , Bertha he has adapted himself to what he thinks my lower mind and lower aims ; he has consciously debased himself , out of thought for me . Horrible ! Of course he believes in his heart that I was a hypocrite before . The astonishing thing is that this did n't cause him to turn cold to me . He must have felt that , but somehow he overcame it . All the worse ! The very fact that he still cared for me shows how bad my influence has been . I feel that I have wrecked his life , Bertha and yet I can not give him my own , to make some poor sort of amends . "
23130	23134	23135	23135	she	183	" Good gracious ! "
23142	23182	23135	23135	she	183	" Is it possible to get into such entanglements of reasoning about what one thinks and feels ? It 's beyond me . Oh they 're bringing the tea . Perhaps a cup of tea will clear my wits . "
23230	23240	23241	23241	Bertha	183	" The tea is doing me so much good , "
23244	23280	23241	23241	Bertha	183	" I begin to feel equal to the most complicated reflections . And so you really believe that Mr. Franks is on the way to perdition , and that you are the cause of it ? "
23314	23322	23323	23323	she	167	" Suppose we go into the garden , "
23328	23339	23323	23323	she	167	" Do n't you feel it a little close here ? "
23382	23391	23375	23375	Bertha	183	" Oh , it does n't interest you . "
23392	23421	23323	23323	she	167	" Does n't it indeed ! Please go on . You had just explained all about ' Sanctuary ' which is n't really a bad picture at all . "
23422	23427	23429	23430	the other	404	" Oh , Bertha ! "
23435	23634	23429	23430	the other	404	" That 's your good nature . You never can speak severely of anybody 's work . The picture is shameful , shameful ! And its successor , I am too sure , will be worse still , from what I have heard of it . Oh , I ca n't bear to think of what it all means Now that it 's too late , I see what I ought to have done . In spite of everything and everybody I ought to have married him in the first year , when I had courage and hope enough to face any hardships . We spoke of it , but he was too generous . What a splendid thing to have starved with him to have worked for him whilst he was working for art and fame , to have gone through and that together , and have come out triumphant ! That was a life worth living . But to begin marriage at one 's ease on the profits of pictures such as ' Sanctuary ' oh , the shame of it ! Do you think I could face the friends who would come to see me ? "
23635	23640	23642	23642	Bertha	183	" How many friends , "
23644	23675	23642	23642	Bertha	183	" would be aware of your infamy ? I credit myself with a little imagination . But I should never have suspected the black baseness which had poisoned your soul . "
23688	23693	23694	23694	she	167	" It only shows , "
23700	23731	23694	23694	she	167	" that I shall do better not to speak of it at all , and let people think what they like of me . If even you ca n't understand . "
23743	23838	23839	23839	she	167	" I understand very well or think I do . I 'm perfectly sure that you could never have broken your engagement unless for the gravest reason and for me it is quite enough to know that . Many a girl ought to do this , who never has the courage . Try not to worry about explanations , the thing is done , and there 's an end of it . I 'm very glad indeed you 're going quite away ; it 's the best thing possible . When do you start ? "
23842	23949	23732	23732	Bertha	183	" In three days . Listen , Bertha , I have something very serious to ask of you . It is possible is n't it ? that he may come to see you some day . If he does , or if by chance you see him alone , and if he speaks of me , I want you to make him think you easily can that what has happened is all for his good . Remind him how often artists have been spoilt by marriage , and hint you surely could that I am rather too fond of luxury , and that kind of thing . "
23956	23960	23961	23961	she	183	" Trust me , "
23964	23972	23961	23961	she	183	" I will blacken you most effectually . "
23973	23997	23732	23732	Bertha	183	" You promise ? But , at the same time , you will urge him to be true to himself , to endure poverty "
23998	24022	23961	23961	she	183	" I do n't know about that . Why should n't poor Mr. Franks have enough to eat it he can get it ? "
24023	24050	23732	23732	Bertha	183	" Well but you promise to help him in the other way ? You need n't say very bad things ; just a smile , a hint "
24051	24056	24058	24058	Bertha	183	" I quite understand , "
24459	24467	24468	24468	he	193	" The astonishing thing to me is , "
24471	24629	24468	24468	he	193	" that I 've made this business pay . I went into it on abstract principle . I knew nothing of business . At school , I rather think , I learnt something about ' single and double entry , ' but I had forgotten it all just as I find myself forgetting how to multiply and divide , now that I am accustomed to the higher mathematics . However , I had to earn a little money , somehow , and I thought I 'd try jam . And it went by itself , I really do n't understand it , mere good luck , I suppose . I hear of fellows who have tried business , and come shocking croppers . Perhaps they were classical men nothing so hopeless as your classic . I beg your pardon ; before saying that , I ought to have found out whether either of you is a classic . "
24640	24670	24630	24631	The listeners	766	" So much the better . An astronomer , it is plain , may manufacture jam ; a fellow brought up on Greek and Latin verses could n't possibly . "
24697	24703	24705	24705	Will	159	" Something that bothers you ? "
24717	24748	24705	24705	Will	159	" No , no ; a private affair ; nothing to do with us . You stay on till Saturday ? I might be back in twenty - four hours . "
24749	24781	24795	24795	He	177	" Good . Yes ; I want to have some more talk with Applegarth about that advertising proposal . I do n't like to start with quite such a heavy outlay . "
24782	24787	24789	24789	Godfrey	177	" Nor I either , "
24808	24826	24795	24795	He	177	" By the bye , the St. Neots money will be paid on Saturday , you said ? "
24827	24837	24795	24795	He	177	" I believe so . Or early next week . "
24838	24872	24795	24795	He	177	" That 's right . I want to get done . Queer how these details fidget me . Nerves ! I ought to have had a holiday this summer . You were wiser . "
24990	24997	24999	25002	the jam - manufacturer	778	" When I first met him , "
25004	25053	24999	25002	the jam - manufacturer	778	" he struck me as the queerest man of business except myself that I had ever seen . He talked about Norse sagas , witchcraft , and so on , and when he began about business , I felt uneasy . Of course I know him better now . "
25054	25066	25068	25068	Will	159	" There are not many steadier and shrewder men than Sherwood , "
25070	25077	25079	25081	the other .	779	" I feel sure of that , "
25095	25104	25083	25083	he	779	" Yes , I feel sure of it . "
25105	25116	25083	25083	he	779	" In spite of all his energy , never rash . "
25117	25129	25131	25131	Applegarth	193	" No , no ; I can see that . Yet , "
25141	25150	25131	25131	Applegarth	193	" he has energy of an uncommon kind . "
25151	25158	25160	25160	Warburton	176	" That will soon show itself , "
25164	25176	25160	25160	Warburton	176	" He 's surveying the field like a general before battle . "
25177	25194	25131	25131	Applegarth	193	" Yes . No end of bright ideas . Some of them perhaps not immediately practicable . "
25195	25203	25160	25160	Warburton	176	" Oh , Sherwood looks far ahead . "
25436	25447	25449	25449	Godfrey	177	" I thought you would n't have left home yet , "
25456	25475	25449	25449	Godfrey	177	" I had a letter from Applegarth last night , which I wanted you to see at once . "
25498	25506	25507	25507	he	177	" Well , that 's all right , "
25510	25544	25507	25507	he	177	" but I do n't see that it need have brought you from Wimbledon to Chelsea before nine o'clock in the morning . Are n't you getting a little overstrung , old man ? "
25573	25578	25579	25579	he	177	" Daresay I am , "
25590	25598	25579	25579	he	177	" Ca n't get much sleep lately . "
25599	25626	25643	25643	Will	159	" But why ? What the deuce is there to fuss about ? Sit down and smoke a cigar . I suppose you 've had breakfast ? "
25627	25642	25579	25579	he	177	" No yes , I mean , yes , of course , long ago . "
25662	25698	25651	25651	He	159	" It 's an unaccountable thing that you should fret your gizzard out about this new affair , which seems all so smooth , when you took the Ailie Street worries without turning a hair . "
25699	25706	25708	25708	Godfrey	177	" Stupid nerves out of order , "
25735	25752	25728	25728	he	177	" I must get away for a week or two as soon as we 've signed . "
25753	25760	25761	25761	Warburton	176	" Yes , but look here . "
25779	25802	25761	25761	Warburton	176	" I do n't quite understand you . You 're not like yourself . Is there anything you 're keeping from me ? "
25803	25814	25761	25761	Warburton	176	" Nothing nothing whatever , I assure you , Warburton . "
25822	25830	25761	25761	Warburton	176	" You have no doubts of Applegarth ? "
25831	25834	25836	25837	the other	404	" Doubts ! "
25839	25885	25836	25837	the other	404	" Not a shadow of doubt of any sort , I declare and protest . No , no ; it 's entirely my own idiotic excitability . I ca n't account for it . Just do n't notice it , there 's a good fellow . "
25886	25920	25761	25761	Warburton	176	" There was a pause . Will glanced again at Applegarth 's note , whilst Sherwood went , as usual , to stand before the bookcase , and run his eye along the shelves .
25921	25928	25929	25929	he	159	" Anything new in my way ? "
25932	26008	25929	25929	he	159	" I want a good long quiet read . Palgrave 's Arabia ! Where did you pick up that ? One of the most glorious books I know . That and Layard 's Early Travels sent me to heaven for a month , once upon a time . You do n't know Layard ? I must give it to you . The essence of romance ! As good in its way as the Arabian Nights . "
26040	26049	26034	26034	he	159	" Have you the St. Neots cheque yet ? "
26050	26055	26079	26079	Will	159	" Came this morning . "
26056	26065	26067	26067	Godfrey	177	" Payable to Sherwood Brothers , I suppose ? "
26069	26078	26067	26067	Godfrey	177	" Right . It 's most convenient so . "
26119	26144	26111	26111	Warburton	176	" Nothing nothing . Well , I suppose I 'd better take it with me ; I 'm on my way to the bank . "
26376	26382	26384	26384	his	159	" What news of Franks ? "
26388	26393	26395	26395	Will	159	" Nothing very good , "
26399	26481	26395	26395	Will	159	" He seems to be still playing the fool . I 've seen him only once in the last fortnight , and then it was evident he 'd been drinking . I could n't help saying a plain word or two , and he turned sullen . I called at his place last night , but he was n't there ; his landlady tells me he 's been out of town several times lately , and he 's done no work . "
26482	26488	26356	26356	His	177	" Has the girl gone ? "
26489	26584	26395	26395	Will	159	" A week ago . I have a letter from Ralph Pomfret . The good old chap worries about this affair ; so does Mrs. Pomfret . He does n't say it plainly , but I suspect Franks has been behaving theatrically down at Ashstead ; it 's possible he went there in the same state in which I saw him last . Pomfret would have done well to punch his head , but I 've no doubt they 've stroked and patted and poor - fellow'd him the very worst thing for Franks . "
26585	26591	26593	26593	Sherwood	177	" Or for any man , "
26595	26635	26395	26395	Will	159	" Worse for him than for most . I wish I had more of the gift of brutality ; I see a way in which I might do him good ; but it goes against the grain with me . "
26636	26642	26644	26644	Godfrey	177	" That I can believe , "
26653	26712	26395	26395	Will	159	" I was afraid he might somehow scrape together money enough to pursue her to Egypt . Perhaps he 's trying for that . The Pomfrets want me to go down to Ashstead and have a talk with them about him . Whether he managed to see the girl before she left England , I do n't know . "
26713	26723	26725	26725	Sherwood	177	" After all , he has been badly treated , "
26728	26792	26395	26395	Will	159	" Well , yes , he has . But a fellow must have common sense , most of all with regard to women . I 'm rather afraid Franks might think it a fine thing to go to the devil because he 's been jilted . It is n't fashionable nowadays ; there might seem to be a sort of originality about it . "
27083	27115	27116	27116	Will	159	" Thanks . Your advice , no doubt , is well meant , but I had rather not have it just now . Do n't let us meet for the present . "
27252	27257	27258	27258	he	160	" Confound the fellow ! "
27268	27283	27262	27262	he	160	" What else can he have to say ? No infernal postponement , I hope "
27300	27304	27307	27308	his partner	385	" My dear Warburton "
27319	27692	27307	27308	his partner	385	" I have such bad news for you that I hardly know how to tell it . If I dared , I would come to you at once , but I simply have not the courage to face you until you know the worst , and have had time to get accustomed to it . It is seven o'clock ; an hour ago I learnt that all our money is lost all yours , all that from St. Neots , all mine every penny I have . I have been guilty of unpardonable folly how explain my behaviour ? The truth is , after the settlement in Little Ailie Street ; I found myself much worse off than I had expected . I went into the money market , and made a successful deal . Counting on being able to repeat this , I guaranteed the sixteen thousand for Bristol ; but the second time I lost . So it has gone on ; all these last weeks I have been speculating , winning and losing . Last Tuesday , when I came to see you , I had about twelve thousand , and hoped somehow to make up the deficiency . As the devil would have it , that same morning I met a City acquaintance , who spoke of a great coup to be made by any one who had some fifteen thousand at command . It meant an immediate profit of 25 per cent . Like a fool , I was persuaded as you will see when I go into details , the thing looked horribly tempting . I put it all every penny that lay at our bank in the name of Sherwood Bros. And now I learn that the house I trusted has smashed . It 's in the papers this evening Biggles , Thorpe and Biggles you 'll see it . I dare not ask you to forgive me . Of course I shall at once take steps to raise the money owing to you , and hope to be able to do that soon , but it 's all over with the Bristol affair . I shall come to see you at twelve to - morrow .
27693	27696	27751	27751	Sherwood	177	" Yours , "
27701	27701	27751	27751	Sherwood	177	"
27704	27714	27307	27308	his partner	385	" After all , there 's something in presentiment . "
27985	28000	27982	27982	she	158	" That Boxon , the grocer , has had a bad accident , sir . "
28001	28006	27982	27982	she	158	" Boxon ? grocer ? "
28007	28021	27982	27982	she	158	" In the Fulham Road , sir ; him as Allchin was with . "
28022	28025	27982	27982	she	158	" Ah ! "
28082	28090	28092	28092	Warburton	176	" So much the worse for him , "
28094	28106	28092	28092	Warburton	176	" I 've no pity to spare for fools and blackguards . "
28107	28194	28092	28092	Warburton	176	" I should think not , indeed sir . I just mentioned it , sir , because Allchin was telling us about it last night . He and his wife looked in to see my sister , Liza , and they both said they never see such a change in anybody . And they said how grateful we ought to be to you , sir , and that I 'm sure we are , for Liza'd never have been able to go away without your kindness . "
28404	28411	28412	28412	she	158	" We was wondering , sir , "
28424	28472	28412	28412	she	158	" whether you 'd be so kind as to let my sister Liza see you just for a minute or two , to thank you herself as I 'm sure she ought ? She could come any time as would n't be ill - convenient to you . "
28473	28482	28483	28483	Will	159	" I 'm extremely busy , Mrs. Hopper , "
28486	28540	28483	28483	Will	159	" Please tell your sister I 'm delighted to hear she 's done so well at Southend , and I hope to see her some day ; but not just now . By the bye , I 'm not going out this morning , so do n't wait , when you 've finished . "
28775	28777	28785	28785	he	177	" raise "
29126	29136	29138	29139	the other	404	" I suppose it 's all true , Warburton , "
29145	29186	29138	29139	the other	404	" but I ca n't believe it yet . I seem to be walking in a nightmare ; and when you gave me your hand at the door , I thought for a second that I 'd just woke up . "
29187	29191	29193	29193	Will	159	" Sit down , "
29195	29208	29193	29193	Will	159	" and let 's have it out . Give me the details . "
29209	29260	29138	29139	the other	404	" That 's exactly what I wish to do . Of course I have n't been to bed , and I 've spent the night in writing out a statement of all my dealings for the past fifteen months . Here it is and here are my pass - books . "
29306	29329	29138	29139	the other	404	" You mean to say that between last September and the end of the year you lost twenty - five thousand pounds ? "
29330	29334	29138	29139	the other	404	" I did . "
29335	29350	29138	29139	the other	404	" And you mean to say that you still went on with your gambling ? "
29351	29363	29138	29139	the other	404	" Things were getting bad in Ailie Street , you know . "
29364	29375	29138	29139	the other	404	" And you did your best to make them desperate . "
29412	29423	29424	29424	he	177	" The devil of the City got hold of me , "
29438	29441	29443	29443	Will	159	" Yes , "
29445	29464	29443	29443	Will	159	" that 's clear . Then , a month ago , you really possessed only nine thousand pounds ? "
29465	29479	29424	29424	he	177	" That was all I had left , out of nearly forty thousand . "
29480	29494	29443	29443	Will	159	" What astonishes me is , that you won from time to time . "
29495	29499	29501	29501	Godfrey	177	" I did ! "
29507	29679	29501	29501	Godfrey	177	" Look at the fifth of February that was a great day ! It 's that kind of thing that tempts a man on . Afterwards I lost steadily but I might have won any day . And I had to make a good deal , if we were to come to terms with Applegarth . I nearly did it . I was as cautious as a man could be content with small things . If only I had n't been pressed for time ! It was only the want of time that made me use your money . Of course , it was criminal . Do n't think I wish to excuse myself for one moment . Absolutely criminal . I knew what was at stake . But I thought the thing was sure . It promised at the least twenty - five per cent . We should have started brilliantly at Bristol several thousands for advertisement , beyond our estimate . I do n't think the Biggles people were dishonest "
29680	29687	29689	29689	Will	159	" You do n't think so ! "
29693	29718	29689	29689	Will	159	" If there 's any doubt we know on which side it weighs . Just tell me the facts . What was the security ? "
29815	29823	29824	29824	he	177	" Thank Heaven , this is over ! "
29837	29896	29824	29824	he	177	" I do n't know how I got through last night . More than once , I thought it would be easier to kill myself than to come and face you . But there was the certainty that I could make good your loss . I may be able to do so very soon . I 've written to "
29918	30001	29897	29897	He	177	" No ; I have n't the right to tell you , though I should like to , to give you confidence . It 's the story of the ten thousand pounds , you remember ? When I lent that money , I promised never to let any one know . Even if I ca n't realise your capital at once , I can pay you good interest until the money 's forthcoming . That would be the same thing to you ? "
30012	30028	30002	30002	Warburton	176	" Let 's understand each other , Sherwood . Have you any income at all ? "
30029	30081	29897	29897	He	177	" None whatever now , except the interest on the ten thousand ; and that well , I 'm sorry to say it has n't been paid very regularly . But in future it must be it shall be . Between two and three thousand are owing to me for arrears . "
30082	30089	30002	30002	Warburton	176	" It 's a queer story . "
30090	30096	30098	30098	Godfrey	177	" I know it is , "
30100	30111	30098	30098	Godfrey	177	" But I hope you do n't doubt my word ? "
30112	30126	30002	30002	Warburton	176	" No , I do n't What 's to be done about Applegarth ? "
30127	30133	30135	30135	Sherwood	177	" I must see him , "
30140	30165	30135	30135	Sherwood	177	" Of course you have no part in the miserable business . I must write at once , and then go and face him . "
30166	30175	30002	30002	Warburton	176	" Of course I shall go with you . "
30176	30207	30135	30135	Sherwood	177	" You will ? That 's kind of you . Luckily he 's a civilised man , not one of the City brutes one might have had to deal with . "
30208	30220	30222	30222	Warburton	176	" We must hope he 'll live up to his reputation , "
30445	30455	30457	30457	Will	159	" I suppose I must go down at once , "
30460	30466	30468	30469	the other	404	" I see no hurry , "
30471	30517	30468	30469	the other	404	" As a matter of fact , your mother and sister will lose nothing . You undertook to pay them a minimum of three per cent . on their money , and that you can do ; I guarantee you that , in any case . "
30622	30636	30638	30639	the other	404	" Do n't do anything hastily , Warburton , I beg of you , "
30641	30687	30638	30639	the other	404	" Things are never so bad as they look at first sight . Wait till I have seen you know who . I might even be able to but it 's better not to promise . Wait a day or two , at all events . "
30934	30944	30953	30954	the speaker	747	" Do you want to cut me , Warburton ? "
30965	30971	30973	30973	Franks	160	" You 're going out , "
30978	30985	30973	30973	Franks	160	" I wo n't keep you . "
31003	31019	30997	30997	Will	159	" Come in . I was thinking of something , and did n't see you . "
31124	31141	31119	31119	he	160	" I 've found a new drink gin and laudanum . First rate for the nerves . "
31142	31145	31147	31147	Warburton	176	" Ah ! "
31150	31171	31147	31147	Warburton	176	" My latest tipple is oil of vitriol with a dash of strychnine . Splendid pick - me - up . "
31179	31188	31189	31189	he	160	" No , but I 'm quite serious , "
31192	31227	31189	31189	he	160	" It 's the only thing that keeps me going . If I had n't found the use of laudanum in small doses , I should have tried a very large one before now . "
31314	31323	31310	31310	Will	159	" When did you last have a bath ? "
31324	31334	31310	31310	Will	159	" Bath ? Good God how do I know ? "
31346	31353	31355	31355	Will	159	" I should advise a Turkish , "
31357	31374	31355	31355	Will	159	" followed by rhubarb of the same country . You 'd feel vastly better next day . "
31375	31379	31381	31381	Franks	160	" The remedies , "
31386	31397	31381	31381	Franks	160	" of one who has never been through moral suffering . "
31398	31431	31310	31310	Will	159	" Yet efficacious , even morally , I can assure you . And , by the bye , I want to know when you 're going to finish ' The Slummer . ' "
31432	31454	31381	31381	Franks	160	" Finish it ? Why , never ! I could as soon turn to and build a bridge over the Thames . "
31455	31470	31310	31310	Will	159	" What do you mean ? I suppose you have to earn your living ? "
31471	31490	31381	31381	Franks	160	" I see no necessity for it . What do I care , whether I live or not ? "
31491	31513	31310	31310	Will	159	" Well , then , I am obliged to ask whether you feel it incumbent upon you to pay your debts ? "
31580	31589	31590	31590	he	868	" Of course I shall do so somehow , "
31595	31607	31637	31637	Warburton	176	" Have you any other way honest way except by working ? "
31608	31636	31637	31637	Warburton	176	" Very well , then , I 'll find work . Real work . Not that cursed daubing , which it turns my stomach to think of . "
31646	31734	31637	31637	Warburton	176	" That 's the talk of a very sore and dazed man . Before long , you 'll be yourself again , and you 'll go back to your painting with an appetite And the sooner you try the better . I do n't particularly like dunning people for money , as I think you know , but , when you can pay that debt of yours , I shall be glad . I 've had a bit of bad luck since last we saw each other . "
31754	31764	31637	31637	Warburton	176	" Bad luck ? What sort of bad luck ? "
31765	31844	31637	31637	Warburton	176	" Why , neither on the turf nor at Monte Carlo . But a speculation has gone wrong , and I 'm adrift . I shall have to leave this flat . How I 'm going to keep myself alive , I do n't know yet . The Bristol affair is of course off . I 'm as good as penniless , and a hundred pounds or so will come very conveniently , whenever you can manage it . "
31845	31852	31637	31637	Warburton	176	" Are you serious , Warburton ? "
31853	31856	31637	31637	Warburton	176	" Perfectly . "
31857	31878	31637	31637	Warburton	176	" You 've really lost everything ? You 've got to leave this flat because you ca n't afford it ? "
31879	31892	31637	31637	Warburton	176	" That , my boy , is the state of the case . "
31893	32047	31637	31637	Warburton	176	" By Jove ! No wonder you did n't see me as I came upstairs . What the deuce ! You in Queer Street ! I never dreamt of such a thing as a possibility . I 've always thought of you as a flourishing capitalist sound as the Mansion House . Why did n't you begin by telling me this ? I 'm about as miserable as a fellow can be , but I should never have bothered you with my miseries . Warburton in want of money ? Why , the idea is grotesque ; I ca n't get hold of it . I came to you as men go to a bank . Of course , I meant to pay it all , some day , but you were so generous and so rich , I never thought there would be any hurry . I 'm astounded I 'm floored ! "
32075	32079	32080	32080	he	870	" You see , "
32090	32104	32080	32080	he	870	" that you 've no choice but to finish ' The Slummer ! ' "
32113	32120	32121	32121	he	160	" Either that or something else , "
32124	32141	32198	32199	the artist	329	" No that ! It 'll bring you two or three hundred pounds without much delay . "
32142	32174	32198	32199	the artist	329	" I daresay it would . But if you knew how I loathe and curse the very sight of the thing Why I have n't burnt it I do n't know . "
32175	32178	32180	32180	Will	159	" Probably , "
32182	32195	32180	32180	Will	159	" because in summer weather you take your gin and laudanum cold . "
32206	32216	32217	32217	he	870	" The hideous time I have been going through ! "
32220	32372	32217	32217	he	870	" It 's no use trying to give you an idea of it . Of course you 'd say it was all damned foolery . Well , I sha n't go through it again , that 's one satisfaction . I 've done with women . One reason why I loathe the thought of going on with that picture is because I still have the girl 's head to put in . But I 'll do it . I 'll go back and get to work at once . If I ca n't find a model , I 'll fake the head get it out of some woman 's paper where the fashions are illustrated ; that 'll do very well . I 'll go and see how the beastly thing looks . It 's turned against the wall , and I wonder I have n't put my boot through it . "
32578	32583	32584	32584	he	159	" Just like me , "
32597	32657	32584	32584	he	159	" I 've no presence of mind . I see the right thing when it 's too late , and when I 've made myself appear a bounder . How many thousand times have I blundered in this way ! A man like me ought to live alone as I 've a very fair chance of doing in future . "
33363	33366	33368	33368	Sherwood	177	" Happily , "
33370	33449	33368	33368	Sherwood	177	" his father 's health is breaking . One is obliged to talk in this brutal way , you know . At the father 's death it will be all right ; I shall then have my legal remedy , if there 's need of it . To take any step of that sort now would be ruinous ; my friend would be cut off with a shilling , if the affair came to his father 's ears . "
33450	33458	33460	33460	Warburton	176	" So this is how we stand , "
33464	33470	33460	33460	Warburton	176	" It 's all over . "
33486	33516	33471	33471	Sherwood	177	" There 's two hundred and sixty pounds the result of the sale of my furniture and things . Will you use that and trust me a little longer ? "
33523	33531	33532	33532	he	177	" What have you to live upon ? "
33538	33555	33471	33471	Sherwood	177	" Oh , I shall get on all right . I 've one or two ideas . "
33556	33566	33471	33471	Sherwood	177	" But this is all the money you have ? "
33567	33575	33577	33578	the other	404	" I 've kept about fifty pounds , "
33580	33602	33577	33578	the other	404	" out of which I can pay my debts they 're small and the rent of my house for this quarter . "
33609	33621	33471	33471	Sherwood	177	" I ca n't take it you know I ca n't . "
33622	33626	33471	33471	Sherwood	177	" You must . "
33627	33637	33639	33639	Will	159	" How the devil are you going to live ? "
33644	33651	33653	33653	Sherwood	177	" I shall find a way , "
33663	33785	33653	33653	Sherwood	177	" I need a little time to look about me , that 's all , There 's a relative of mine , an old fellow who lives comfortably in North Wales , and who invites me down every two or three years . The best thing will be for me to go and spend a short time with him , and get my nerves into order I 'm shaky , there 's no disguising it . I have n't exhausted all the possibilities of raising money ; there 's hope still in one or two directions ; if I get a little quietness and rest I shall be able to think things out more clearly Do n't you think this justifiable ? "
33809	33820	33822	33822	Sherwood	177	" You have n't said anything to Mrs. Warburton yet ? "
33825	33829	33831	33831	Will	159	" Not yet , "
33833	33873	33874	33874	Will	159	" I wish you could postpone it a little longer . Could you do you think without too much strain of conscience ? Does n't it seem a pity when any day may enable me to put things right ? "
34778	34793	34769	34773	a woman whom he passed	925	" See ' ere ! The shutters is up . Boxon must be dead . "
35018	35026	35027	35027	she	935	" You look dre'ful tired , sir , "
35030	35048	35027	35027	she	935	" I 'll make you a cup of tea at once . It 'll do you good . "
35049	35057	35059	35059	Warburton	176	" Yes , get me some tea , "
35075	35086	35072	35072	he	159	" Is it true that the grocer Boxon is dead ? "
35087	35100	35102	35103	Mrs. Hopper	158	" I was going to speak of it this morning , sir , "
35105	35140	35102	35103	Mrs. Hopper	158	" but you seemed so busy . Yes , sir , he 's died died the day before yesterday , they say , and it 'd be surprising to hear as anybody 's sorry . "
35141	35148	35150	35150	Warburton	176	" Who 'll take his business ? "
35152	35220	35102	35103	Mrs. Hopper	158	" We was talking about that last night , sir , me and my sister Liza , and the Allchins . It 's fallen off a great deal lately , what else could you expect ? since Boxon got into his bad ways . But anybody as had a little money might do well there . Allchin was saying he wished he had a few ' undreds . "
35221	35229	35231	35232	the listener	746	" A few hundred would be enough ? "
35247	35272	35102	35103	Mrs. Hopper	158	" Allchin thinks the goodwill can be had for about a ' undred , sir ; and the rent , it 's only eighty pounds "
35273	35278	35102	35103	Mrs. Hopper	158	" Shop and house ? "
35279	35300	35102	35103	Mrs. Hopper	158	" Yes , sir ; so Allchin says . It is n't much of a ' ouse , of course . "
35301	35317	35102	35103	Mrs. Hopper	158	" What profits could be made , do you suppose , by an energetic man ? "
35318	35325	35327	35328	Mrs. Hopper	158	" When Boxon began , sir , "
35334	35395	35327	35328	Mrs. Hopper	158	" he used to make so Allchin says a good five or six ' undred a year . There 's a good deal of profit in the grocery business , and Boxon 's situation is good ; there 's no other grocer near him . But of course as Allchin says you want to lay out a good deal at starting "
35396	35409	35411	35411	Will	159	" Yes , yes , of course , you must have stock . "
35414	35425	35411	35411	Will	159	" Bring me some tea at once , Mrs. Hopper . "
35680	35698	35665	35665	he	159	" I want to have a little talk with you , Mrs. Hopper . Please sit down . "
35744	35749	35750	35750	Warburton	176	" You have noticed , "
35753	35806	35750	35750	Warburton	176	" that I have n't been quite myself lately . There was a good reason for it . I 've had a misfortune in business ; all my plans are changed ; I shall have to begin quite a new life a different life altogether from that I have led till now . "
35831	35844	35845	35845	Will	159	" There 's no need to talk about it , you know , "
35853	35884	35845	35845	Will	159	" I tell you , because I 'm thinking of going into a business in which your brother - in - law could help me , if he cares to . "
35897	35967	35968	35968	she	158	" Allchin'll be very glad to hear of that , sir . What am I saying ? Of course I do n't mean he 'll be glad you 've had misfortune , sir , and I 'm that sorry to hear it , I ca n't tell you . But it does just happen as he 's out of work , through that nasty temper of his . Not , "
35973	36002	35970	35970	herself	158	" as I ought to call him nasty - tempered . With a good employer , I 'm sure he 'd never get into no trouble at all . "
36003	36016	36069	36070	Mrs. Hopper	158	" Does he still wish to get back into the grocery business ? "
36017	36038	35970	35970	herself	158	" He 'd be only too glad , sir , But , of course , any place as you offered him "
36039	36045	36047	36047	Warburton	176	" Well , it happens , "
36049	36061	36047	36047	Warburton	176	" that it is the grocery business I 'm thinking about . "
36062	36067	36069	36070	Mrs. Hopper	158	" You , sir ? "
36072	36082	35970	35970	herself	158	" I think I shall take Boxon 's shop . "
36083	36106	35970	35970	herself	158	" You , sir ? Take a grocer 's shop ? You mean , you 'd put Allchin in to manage it ? "
36107	36117	36119	36119	Will	159	" No , I do n't , Mrs. Hopper , "
36124	36184	36119	36119	Will	159	" I have more than my own living to earn ; other people are dependent upon me , so I must make as much money as possible . I can t afford to pay a manager . I shall go behind the counter myself , and Allchin , if he cares for the place , shall be my assistant . "
36197	36241	36185	36187	The good woman	935	" Suppose you have a word with Allchin , and send him to see me this evening ? I say again , there 's no need to talk about the thing to anybody else . We 'll just keep it quiet between us . "
36242	36251	36253	36254	Mrs. Hopper	158	" You can depend upon me , sir , "
36256	36290	36253	36254	Mrs. Hopper	158	" But did you hever ! It 's come upon me so sudden like . And what 'll Allchin say ! Why , he 'll think I 'm having a game with him . "
36411	36417	36418	36418	he	177	" What difference is there , "
36421	36442	36418	36418	he	177	" between selling sugar from an office in Whitechapel , and selling it from behind a counter in Fulham Road ? "
36461	36500	36501	36501	He	177	" You are splendid ! What energy ! What courage ! I could almost say that I do n't regret my criminal recklessness , seeing that it has given the occasion for such a magnificent display of character . "
36504	36550	36501	36501	He	177	" Of course it will be only for a short time . Even if the plans I am now working out details shortly come to nothing a very unlikely thing , I am sure to recover my ten thousand pounds in a year or so . "
36551	36555	36556	36556	he	177	" Of course , "
36562	36573	36556	36556	he	177	" I breathe no word of it to any mortal . "
36685	36688	36696	36697	his mother	346	" agency , "
36777	36779	36737	36738	a grocer	492	" Plant "
37146	37156	37158	37158	Will	159	" How would something of this kind suit you ? "
37160	37165	37166	37166	Allchin	161	" Me , sir ? "
37171	37179	37166	37166	Allchin	161	" You ask how it suits me ? "
37199	37221	37166	37166	Allchin	161	" Then suppose we settle it so . I 've written out the terms of your engagement . Read and sign . "
37247	37254	37256	37256	Warburton	176	" Something you want to alter ? "
37258	37293	37166	37166	Allchin	161	" Why , sir , you 've altogether forgot as I 'm in your debt . It stands to reason as you must take that money out before you begin to pay me anything . "
37294	37337	37166	37166	Allchin	161	" Oh , we wo n't say anything more about that trifle . We 're making a new beginning . But look here , Allchin , I do n't want you to quarrel with me , as you do with every one else "
37338	37348	37166	37166	Allchin	161	" With you , sir ? Ho , ho ! "
37360	37364	37365	37365	he	977	" I quarrel , "
37368	37398	37365	37365	he	977	" with people as are insulting , or as try to best me . It goes against my nature , sir , to be insulted and to be bested . "
37423	37430	37432	37432	Will	159	" I 've thought of that , "
37434	37442	37432	37432	Will	159	" What do you say to Jollyman ? "
37627	37639	37640	37640	he	977	" When I think as the name used to be Boxon , "
37646	37778	37640	37640	he	977	" why , I ca n't believe as any money was ever made here . Boxon ! Why , it was enough to drive customers away ! If you ever heard a worse name , sir , for a shopkeeper , I should be glad to be told of it . But Jollyman ! Why , it 'll bring people from Putney , from Battersea , from who knows how far . Jollyman 's Teas , Jollyman 's sugar ca n't you hear 'em saying it , already ? It 's a fortune in itself , that name . Why , sir , if a grocer called Boxon came at this moment , and offered to take me into partnership on half profits , I would n't listen to him there ! "
38067	38079	38115	38116	The landlady	563	" Two unfurnished rooms to be let to single gentlemen only . "
38268	38285	38287	38288	Mrs. Wick	223	" There 's one thing I must say to you quite plain , to begin with , "
38302	38314	38287	38288	Mrs. Wick	223	" I ca n't admit female visitors not on any excuse . "
38355	38359	38361	38362	the landlady	563	" Another thing , "
38364	38374	38376	38376	she	563	" is that I do n't like late hours . "
38392	38399	38400	38400	Will	159	" Why , neither do I , "
38403	38421	38400	38400	Will	159	" But for all that , I may be obliged to come home late now and then . "
38422	38430	38376	38376	she	563	" From the theatre , I suppose ? "
38431	38440	38441	38442	Mrs. Wick	223	" I very seldom go to the theatre . "
38459	38475	38441	38442	Mrs. Wick	223	" But as to my hour of returning home , I must have entire liberty . "
38486	38493	38494	38494	she	296	" You have n't told me , "
38504	38512	38494	38494	she	296	" exactly what your business may be . "
38513	38521	38523	38523	Will	159	" I am in the sugar line , "
38525	38540	38559	38560	the woman	296	" Sugar ? You would n't mind giving me the name of your employers ? "
38568	38599	38559	38560	the woman	296	" I do n't doubt but that you 're quite respectable , sir , but you can understand as I have to be careful who I take into my house . "
38600	38635	38559	38560	the woman	296	" I understand that , but I must ask you to be satisfied with a reference to my present landlord . That , and a month 's payment in advance , ought to suffice . "
38839	38848	38849	38849	she	563	" I would n't mind taking fifteen shillings , "
38852	38862	38849	38849	she	563	" if I knew it was for a permanency . "
38863	38875	38822	38823	The landlady	563	" I ca n't bind myself more than by the month . "
38876	38886	38849	38849	she	563	" Would you be willing to leave a deposit ? "

39226	39346	39202	39202	she	164	" I am often worse than depressed . I sleep very badly , and in the night I often shed wretched tears . Though I did only what conscience compelled me to do , I suffer all the miseries of remorse . And how can I wish that it should be otherwise ? It is better , surely , to be capable of such suffering , than to go one 's way in light - hearted egoism . I 'm not sure that I do n't sometimes encourage despondency . You can understand that ? I know you can , dear Bertha , for many a time I have detected the deep feeling which lies beneath your joking way . "
39406	39410	39411	39411	she	174	" I suppose , "
39419	39428	39411	39411	she	174	" we shall never again see Mr. Franks . "
39429	39442	39444	39444	Bertha	183	" He would find it rather awkward to call , no doubt , "
39446	39453	39454	39455	Mrs. Cross	174	" I shall never understand it ! "
39467	39478	39454	39455	Mrs. Cross	174	" No doubt there 's something you keep from me . "
39479	39492	39454	39455	Mrs. Cross	174	" About Rosamund ? Nothing whatever , I assure you , mother . "
39493	39507	39454	39455	Mrs. Cross	174	" Then you yourself do n't know all , that 's quite certain . "
39692	39702	39703	39703	she	174	" I shall most certainly deal at Jollyman 's , "
39706	39865	39703	39703	she	174	" What a pity we did n't know of him before ! Such a gentlemanly man indeed , quite a gentleman . I never saw a shopkeeper who behaved so nicely . So different from Billings a man I have always thoroughly disliked , and his coffee has been getting worse and worse . Mr. Jollyman is quite willing to send even the smallest orders . Is n't that nice of him such a distance ! Billings was quite insolent to me the day before yesterday , when I asked him to send ; yet it was nearly a two - shilling order . Never go into that shop again , Bertha . It 's really quite a pleasure to buy of Mr. Jollyman ; he knows how to behave ; I really almost felt as if I was talking to some one of our own class . Without his apron , he must be a thorough gentleman . "
39873	39885	39886	39886	she	1033	" How thoughtless of him to wear an apron at all ! "
39890	39904	39886	39886	she	1033	" Could n't one suggest to him discreetly , that but for the apron "
39905	39913	39915	39916	her mother	716	" Do n't be ridiculous , Bertha ! "
39918	40044	39915	39916	her mother	716	" You always make nonsense of what one says . Mr. Jollyman is a shopkeeper , and it 's just because he does n't forget that , after all , that his behaviour is so good . Do you remember that horrid Stokes , in King 's Road ? There was a man who thought himself too good for his business , and in reality was nothing but an underbred , impertinent creature . I can hear his ' Yes , Mrs. Cross no , Mrs. Cross thank you , Mrs. Cross ' and once , when I protested against an overcharge , he cried out , ' Oh , my dear Mrs. Cross ! ' The insolence of that man ! Now , Mr. Jollyman "
40185	40188	40193	40193	he	222	" madam , "
40198	40200	40193	40193	he	222	" miss "
40391	40430	40462	40462	she	1049	" I hear that N. F. has a picture in the Academy called ' A Ministering Angel , ' and that it promises to be one of the most popular of the year . Have you seen it ? "
40445	40448	40462	40462	she	1049	" N.F 's "
40494	40498	40462	40462	she	1049	" A Ministering Angel "
40565	40571	40572	40572	she	167	" N. F 's picture , "
40575	40693	40572	40572	she	167	" is evidently a great success and you can imagine how I feel about it . I saw it , you remember , at an early stage , when he called it ' The Slummer , ' and you remember too , the effect it had upon me . Oh , Bertha , this is nothing less than a soul 's tragedy ! When I think what he used to be , what I hoped of him , what he hoped for himself ! Is it not dreadful that he should have fallen so low , and in so short a time ! A popular success ! Oh , the shame of it , the bitter shame ! "
40733	40790	40724	40724	she	167	" A soul 's tragedy , Bertha , and I the cause of it One can see now , but too well , what is before him . All his hardships are over , and all his struggles . He will become a popular painter one of those whose name is familiar to the crowd , like "
40795	40983	40724	40724	she	167	" I can say , with all earnestness , that I had rather have seen him starved to death . Poor , poor N. F. ! Something whispers to me that perhaps I was always under an illusion about him . Could he so rapidly sink to this , if he were indeed the man I thought him ? Would he not rather have oh , have done anything ? Yet this may be only a temptation of my lower self , a way of giving ease to my conscience . Despair may account for his degradation . And when I remember that a word , one word , from me , the right moment , would have checked him on the dangerous path ! When I saw ' Sanctuary , ' why had I not the courage to tell him what I thought ? No , I became the accomplice of his suicide , and I , alone , am the cause of this wretched disaster . Before long he will be rich . Can you imagine N. F. rich ? I shudder at the thought . "
41021	41026	41028	41028	she	1053	" I grieve with you "
41030	41253	41028	41028	she	1053	" over the shocking prospect of N. F. 's becoming rich . Alas ! I fear the thing is past praying for ; I can all but see the poor young man in a shiny silk hat and an overcoat trimmed with the most expensive fur . His Academy picture is everywhere produced ; a large photogravure will soon be published ; all day long a crowd stands before it at Burlington House , and his name shall we ever again dare to speak it ? is on the lips of casual people in train and ' bus and tram . How shall I write on such a painful subject ? You see that my hand is unsteady . Do n't blame yourself too much . The man capable of becoming rich will become so , whatever the noble influences which endeavour to restrain him . I suspect I feel all but convinced that N. F. could not help himself ; the misfortune is that his fatal turn for moneymaking did not show itself earlier , and so warn you away . I do n't know whether I dare send you a paragraph I have cut from yesterday 's Echo . Yet I will it will serve to show you that as you used to write from Egypt all this is Kismet . "
41362	41364	41339	41340	Mr. Franks	160	" Exponent "
41550	41555	41556	41556	Rosamund	167	" As you know , "
41559	41799	41556	41556	Rosamund	167	" I have never doubted that you would make a success one day , for you are wonderfully clever , and only need a little more self - confidence in making yourself known . I wish I could feel anything like so sure of earning money . For I shall have to , that is now certain . Poor father , who gets weaker and weaker , talked to us the other day about what we could expect after his death ; and it will be only just a little sum for each of us , nothing like enough to invest and live upon . I am working at my water - colours , and I have been trying pastel there 's no end of good material here . When the end comes and it ca n't be long I must go to London , and see whether my things have any market value . I do n't like the prospect of life in a garret on bread and water by myself , that is . You know how joyfully , gladly , proudly , I would have accepted it , under other circumstances . If I had real talent myself but I feel more than doubtful about that . I pray that I may not fall too low . Can I trust you to overwhelm me with scorn , if I seem in danger of doing vulgar work ? "
42054	42063	42064	42064	he	160	" How glad I am to see you ! "
42080	42118	42064	42064	he	160	" I ought to have been to Walham Green long ago . Again and again I meant to come . But this is jolly ; I like chance meetings . Are you often down here in Surrey ? "
42201	42220	42183	42183	Franks	160	" Going to make use of them , no doubt . What are you working at just now ? "
42271	42280	42282	42282	Bertha	183	" Your Academy picture was a great success , "
42291	42299	42300	42300	he	160	" Yes , I suppose it was , "
42310	42341	42300	42300	he	160	" Did you see it ? And what did you think of it ? No , seriously ; I should like your real opinion . I know you have opinions . "
42342	42350	42352	42352	Bertha	183	" You meant it to be successful , "
42356	42399	42300	42300	he	160	" Well , yes , I did . At the same time I think some of the critics the high and mighty ones , you know were altogether wrong about it . Perhaps , on the whole , you take their view ? "
42400	42408	42410	42411	his companion	1080	" Oh no , I do n't , "
42415	42427	42410	42411	his companion	1080	" I thought the picture very clever , and very true . "
42428	42585	42300	42300	he	160	" I 'm delighted ! I 've always maintained that it was perfectly true . A friend of mine why , you remember me speaking of Warburton Warburton wanted me to make the Slummer ugly . But why ? It 's just the prettiest girls of that kind who go slumming nowadays . Still , you are quite right . I did mean it to be ' successful . ' I had to make a success , that 's the fact of the matter . You know what bad times I was having . I got sick of it , that 's the truth . Then , I owed money , and money that had to be paid back , one way or another . Now I 'm out of debt , and see my way to live and work in decent comfort . And I maintain that I 've done nothing to be ashamed of . "
42590	42605	42608	42608	Franks	160	" I 've just finished a portrait a millionaire 's wife , Lady Rockett , "
42610	42815	42608	42608	Franks	160	" Of course it was my Slummer that got me the job . Women have been raving about that girl 's head ; and it is n't bad , though I say it . I had to take a studio at a couple of days ' notice could n't ask Lady Rockett to come and sit at that place of mine in Battersea ; a shabby hole . She is n't really anything out of the way , as a pretty woman ; but I 've made her well , you 'll see it at some exhibition this winter , if you care to . Pleased ? Is n't she pleased ! And her husband , the podgy old millionaire baronet , used to come every day and stare in delight . To tell you the truth , I think it 's rather a remarkable bit of painting . I did n't quite know I could turn out anything so chic . I should n't be surprised if I make a specialty of women 's portraits . How many men can flatter , and still keep a good likeness ? That 's what I 've done . But wait till you see the thing . "
42958	42966	42969	42969	him	160	" And it all comes too late , "
42973	42977	42969	42969	him	160	" Too late . "
42978	42982	43027	43027	Bertha	183	" Your success ? "
42983	42993	42994	42994	He	160	" What 's the good of it to me ? "
43005	43026	42994	42994	He	160	" A couple of years ago , money would have meant everything . Now what do I care about it ! "
43039	43050	43051	43051	she	183	" Do n't you think it 'll grow upon you , "
43054	43061	43051	43051	she	183	" if you give it time ? "
43062	43097	43098	43098	He	160	" Grow upon me ? Why , I 'm only afraid it may . That 's just the danger . To pursue success vulgar success when all the better part has gone out of life "
43112	43114	43116	43117	his companion	1080	" But "
43123	43161	43116	43117	his companion	1080	" is n't it easy not to pursue success ? I mean if it really makes you uncomfortable . There are so many kinds of work in art which would protect you against the perils of riches . "
43170	43173	43174	43174	he	160	" Miss Cross "
43177	43211	43174	43174	he	160	" I suspect you are satirical . I remember you used to have a turn that way . Well , well , never mind ; I do n't expect you to understand me . "
43233	43244	43246	43246	Franks	160	" I suppose we are both going the same way , "
43255	43299	43246	43246	Franks	160	" There 's a train at something after five , if we can catch it . Splendid idea of yours to have a whole day 's walking . I do n't walk enough . Are you likely to be going again before long ? "
43318	43464	43309	43309	Her	183	" Of course . That 's the only way . Well , if you 'll let me , I must come to Walham Green , one of these days . How 's Mrs. Cross ? I ought to have asked before , but I never do the right thing . Have you any particular day for being at home ? All right . If you had had , I should have asked you to let me come on some other . I do n't care much , you know , for general society ; and ten to one , when I do come I shall be rather gloomy . Old memories , you know . Really very jolly , this meeting with you . I should have done the walk to Epsom just as a constitutional , without enjoying it a bit . As it is "
43624	43636	43637	43637	he	222	" I think I have something that will do very well , "
43640	43647	43637	43637	he	222	" Excuse me for a moment . "
43665	43681	43654	43654	he	222	" It will do ? Then you shall have it in about half an hour . "
43682	43690	43692	43692	Bertha	222	" I 'm ashamed to trouble you , "
43693	43698	43654	43654	he	222	" I could carry it "
43699	43714	43692	43692	Bertha	222	" On no account . The boy will be free in a few minutes . "
43715	43721	43723	43723	Bertha	222	" And I owe you ? "
43729	43736	43738	43739	Mr. Jollyman	222	" The box has no value , "
43758	43765	43766	43766	he	222	" And at the same time , "
43776	43809	43766	43766	he	222	" I will ask you to accept one of these packets of chocolate . I am giving one to - day to every customer to celebrate the anniversary of my opening shop . "
43810	43816	43818	43818	Bertha	222	" Thank you very much , "
43829	43858	43826	43826	she	458	" I will put it with what I am sending in the box a present for two brothers of mine who are a long way off in Canada . "
43895	43906	43889	43889	he	222	" Canada ? Do they like their life out there ? "
43907	43927	43889	43889	he	222	" They seem to enjoy it , on the whole . But it evidently is n't an easy life . "
43928	43936	43938	43939	the grocer	2628	" Not many kinds of life are . "
43941	43948	43938	43939	the grocer	2628	" But the open air the liberty "
43949	43962	43964	43964	Bertha	222	" Oh yes , that must be the good side of it , "
43966	43972	43964	43964	Bertha	222	" On a morning like this "
44875	44878	44870	44870	they	1129	" Mr. Jollyman "
45287	45289	45267	45267	he	177	" work "
45574	45578	45548	45548	she	1157	" Bertha Cross . "
45588	45596	45601	45601	his	160	" rather a nice sort of girl , "
45747	45764	45765	45765	he	159	" I suppose you see no more of those people what 's their name the Crosses ? "
45783	45790	45765	45765	he	159	" Lost sight of them altogether , "
45795	45801	45765	45765	he	159	" Why do you ask ? "
45802	45810	45812	45812	Will	159	" I happened to think of them , "
46505	46538	46562	46563	the woman	296	" Poor creature , is n't it a miserable as well as a sordid life . Let her have her pickings , however illegitimate , and much good may they do her . "
46657	46664	46654	46654	he	159	" Oh never mind the ha'penny , "
46709	46782	46783	46783	He	159	" It 's the kindness of your ' eart , sir , and if anybody knows how much of that you have , I 'm sure it 's me , and I ought to be the last to find fault with it . But that 'll never do behind the counter , sir , never ! Why , just think . The profit on what that woman bought was just three farthings . "
46788	46848	46783	46783	He	159	" And there you 've been and given her a whole ha'penny , so that you 've only one blessed farthing over on the whole transaction ! That ai n't business , sir ; that 's charity ; and Jollyman 's ai n't a charitable institution . You really must not , sir . It 's unjust to yourself . "
47309	47331	47306	47306	Will	159	" Business , business ! A good deal to do at first , you know . Things'll be smoother next year . "
47417	47466	47414	47415	the artist	329	" What has become of you ? I have n't had a chance of getting your way work and social foolery . Could you come and lunch with me here , on Sunday , alone , like the old days ? I have a portrait to show you . "
47627	47632	47634	47635	the other	404	" Out of sorts ? "
47646	47652	47634	47635	the other	404	" You look rather bad . "
47653	47658	47660	47660	Warburton	176	" Leave me alone , "
47662	47673	47634	47635	the other	404	" All right . Sit down here and thaw yourself . "
47714	47719	47634	47635	the other	404	" Who 's that ? "
47720	47737	47634	47635	the other	404	" Lady Caroline I told you about her do n't you think it 's rather good ? "
47738	47753	47634	47635	the other	404	" Yes . And for that very reason I 'm afraid it 's bad . "
47758	47839	47754	47755	The artist	329	" That 's good satire on the critics . When anything strikes them as good by a new man , that is they 're ashamed to say so , just because they never dare trust their own judgment . But it is good , Warburton ; uncommonly good . If there 's a weak point , it 's doggy ; I ca n't come the Landseer . Still , you can see it 's meant for a doggy , eh ? "
47840	47845	47847	47847	Will	159	" I guessed it , "
47853	47859	47862	47862	Franks	160	" Lady Caroline is superb , "
47877	47958	47862	47862	Franks	160	" This is my specialty , old boy lovely woman made yet lovelier , without loss of likeness . She 'll be the fury of the next Academy . See that something in the eyes , Warburton ? Do n't know how to call it . My enemies call it claptrap . But they ca n't do the trick , my boy , they ca n't do it . They 'd give the end of their noses if they could . "
47984	47992	47994	47994	Franks	160	" All your doing , you know , "
48005	48031	47994	47994	Franks	160	" You 've made me . But for you I should have gone to the devil . I was saying so yesterday to the Crosses . "
48032	48036	47994	47994	Franks	160	" The Crosses ? "
48049	48057	48059	48059	Franks	160	" Do n't you remember the Crosses ? "
48067	48163	48059	48059	Franks	160	" Rosamund 's friends at Walham Green . I met them by chance not long ago , and they wanted me to go and see them . The old lady 's a bore , but she can be agreeable when she likes ; the girl 's rather clever does pictures for children 's books , you know . She seems to be getting on better lately . But they are wretchedly poor . I was saying to them oh , but that reminds me of something else . You have n't seen the Pomfrets lately ? "
48164	48167	48278	48278	Warburton	176	" No . "
48168	48180	48059	48059	Franks	160	" Then you do n't know that Mr. Elvan 's dead ? "
48181	48184	48278	48278	Warburton	176	" No . "
48185	48245	48059	48059	Franks	160	" He died a month ago , over there in the South of France . Rosamund has gone back to Egypt , to stay with that friend of hers at Cairo . Mrs. Pomfret hints to me that the girls will have to find a way of earning their living ; Elvan has left practically nothing . I wonder whether "
48252	48256	48258	48259	the listener	746	" Whether what ? "
48261	48271	48059	48059	Franks	160	" Oh , nothing . What 's the time ? "
48272	48276	48278	48278	Warburton	176	" Whether what ? "
48282	48292	48059	48059	Franks	160	" Well whether Rosamund does n't a little regret ? "
48293	48297	48299	48299	Will	159	" Do you ? "
48305	48541	48059	48059	Franks	160	" I ? Not for a moment , my dear boy ! She did me the greatest possible kindness only you even did me a greater . At this moment I should have been cursing and smoking cheap tobacco in Battersea unless I had got sick of it all and done the hic jacet business , a strong probability . Never did a girl behave more sensibly . Some day I hope to tell her so ; of course when she has married somebody else . Then I 'll paint her portrait , and make her the envy of a season by Jove , I will ! Splendid subject , she 'd be . . . . When I think of that beastly so - called portrait that I put my foot through , the day I was in hell ! Queer how one develops all at a jump . Two years ago I could no more paint a woman 's portrait than I could build a cathedral . I caught the trick in the Slummer , but did n't see all it meant till Blackstaffe asked me to paint Lady Rockett . Rosamund ought to have given me the sack when she saw that daub , meant for her . Good little girl ; she held as long as she could . Oh , I 'll paint her divinely , one of these days . "
48619	48630	48632	48632	Will	159	" I ought n't to have come to - day , "
48640	48657	48632	48632	Will	159	" I feel like a bear with a sore head . I think I 'm going . "
48658	48668	48670	48671	the other	404	" Shall I come and see you some evening ? "
48677	48692	48632	48632	Will	159	" No I mean not just yet . I 'll write and ask you . "
48823	48830	48832	48833	the assistant	972	" We shall starve him out ! "
48841	48850	48852	48852	Will	159	" And what 'll become of him then ? "
48854	48865	48867	48867	Allchin	161	" Oh , that 's for him to think about , "
48869	48882	48867	48867	Allchin	161	" Would n't he starve us , if he could , sir ? "
49007	49093	49095	49095	Will	159	" And I myself am crushing the man as surely as if I had my hand on his gullet and my knee on his chest ! Crush him I must ; otherwise , what becomes of that little home down at St. Neots dear to me as his children are to him . There 's no room for both of us ; he has come too near ; he must pay the penalty of his miscalculation . Is there not the workhouse for such people ? "
49102	49122	49095	49095	Will	159	" There 's the workhouse do n't I pay poor - rates ? the workhouse is an admirable institution . "
50235	50238	50230	50230	Warburton	176	" Liza , "
50583	50612	50578	50578	He	159	" Not much chance , I 'm afraid . Of course , if she were able to change climate that kind of thing . But , under the circumstances "
50653	50664	50619	50619	Will	159	" Of course , if she were able to change climate "
51544	51547	51536	51536	she	183	" customers , "
51734	51737	51739	51740	the painter	389	" Hallo ! "
51748	51756	51739	51740	the painter	389	" I thought that was your back ! "
51757	51763	51765	51765	Will	159	" Your engagement was here ? "
51777	51784	51785	51785	He	159	" Yes . I was obliged to "
51801	51806	51785	51785	He	159	" You were obliged ? "
51807	51814	51816	51816	Franks	160	" You see the ladies there , "
51822	51876	51816	51816	Franks	160	" there , on the seat ? It 's Mrs. Cross and her daughter you remember the Crosses ? I called to see them yesterday , and only Mrs. Cross was at home , and the fact is , I as good as promised to meet them here , if it was fine . "
51877	51881	51883	51883	Warburton	176	" Very well , "
51886	51893	51883	51883	Warburton	176	" I wo n't keep you . "
51894	51898	51899	51899	Franks	160	" Go , but "
51932	51962	51926	51926	he	159	" Look here , Warburton , let me introduce you to them . They 're very nice people ; I 'm sure you 'd like them ; do let me "
51963	51977	51926	51926	he	159	" Thank you , no . I do n't want any new acquaintances . "
51978	51986	51988	51989	the other	404	" Why ? Come along old man , "
51991	52008	51988	51989	the other	404	" You 're getting too grumpy ; you live too much alone . Just to please me "
52009	52012	52014	52014	Will	159	" No ! "
52021	52056	51926	51926	he	159	" Very well just as you like . But , I say , should I find you at home this evening ? Say , nine o'clock . I particularly want to have a talk . "
52057	52065	52067	52067	Will	159	" Good . I 'll be there , "
52173	52180	52182	52182	Franks	160	" That was a lucky chance , "
52186	52192	52182	52182	Franks	160	" our meeting this afternoon . "
52193	52198	52182	52182	Franks	160	" Lucky ? Why ? "
52199	52229	52182	52182	Franks	160	" Because it has given me the courage to speak to you about something . Queerest chance I ever knew that you should be there close by the Crosses . "
52230	52238	52240	52240	Warburton	176	" Did they ask who I was ? "
52259	52280	52282	52282	Franks	160	" They did n't happen to see me whilst I was talking with you . But , in any case , "
52284	52326	52282	52282	Franks	160	" they would n't have asked . They 're well - bred people , you know really ladies . I suspect you 've had a different idea of them . Was n't that why you would n't let me introduce you ? "
52327	52332	52334	52334	Will	159	" Not at all , "
52341	52350	52334	52334	Will	159	" I 've no doubt of their ladyhood . "
52351	52359	52361	52362	the other	404	" The fact of the matter is , "
52378	52413	52361	52362	the other	404	" that I 've been seeing them now and then since I told you I was going to call there . You guess why ? It is n't Mrs. Cross , depend upon it . "
52414	52422	52424	52424	Will	159	" Mrs. Cross 's tea , perhaps ? "
52431	52453	52361	52362	the other	404	" Not exactly . It 's the worst tea I ever tasted . I must advise her to change her grocer . "
52472	52486	52466	52466	Franks	160	" You 'll never make a better joke in your life than that . "
52487	52497	52499	52500	the artist	329	" Shows what I can do when I try , "
52502	52511	52499	52500	the artist	329	" However , the tea is shockingly bad . "
52512	52525	52527	52527	Will	159	" What can you expect for one and sevenpence halfpenny per pound ? "
52529	52538	52499	52500	the artist	329	" How do you know what she pays ? "
52548	52556	52557	52557	Franks	160	" Well , I should n't wonder , "
52561	52639	52557	52557	Franks	160	" The fact is , you know , they 're very poor . It 's a miserable sort of a life for a girl like Bertha Cross . She 's clever , in her way ; did you ever see any of her work ? Children 's book - illustrating ? It 's more than passable , I assure you . But of course she 's wretchedly paid . Apart from that , a really nice girl . "
52640	52651	52653	52653	Warburton	176	" So this is what you had to tell me ? "
52665	52681	52653	52653	Warburton	176	" I wanted to talk about it , old man , that 's the truth . "
52725	52732	52733	52733	he	160	" I suppose it 's settled , "
52741	52746	53032	53032	Warburton	176	" Settled ? How ? "
52747	52756	52696	52696	Will	159	" When it comes to meetings at Kew Gardens "
52757	52763	52765	52765	Franks	160	" Oh do n't misunderstand , "
52768	52799	52765	52765	Franks	160	" I told you that it was with the mother I made the appointment not with Bertha herself . I 'm quite sure Bertha never heard a word of it . "
52800	52810	52696	52696	Will	159	" Well , it comes to the same thing . "
52811	52822	52765	52765	Franks	160	" Not at all ! I half wish it did . "
52823	52826	52828	52828	Warburton	176	" Half ? "
52835	52850	52852	52852	Franks	160	" Ca n't you see that I have n't really made up my mind , "
52859	53024	52852	52852	Franks	160	" I 'm not sure of myself and I 'm still less sure of her . It 's all in the air . I 've been there perhaps half a dozen times but only like any other acquaintance . And , you know , she is n't the kind of girl to meet one half way . I 'm sorry you do n't know her . You 'd be able to understand better . Then , you see , there 's something a little awkward in her position and mine . She 's the intimate friend of of the other one , you know ; at least , I suppose she still is ; of course we have n't said anything about that . It makes misunderstandings very possible . Suppose she thought I made friends with her in the hope of getting round to the other again ? You see how difficult it is to judge her behaviour to come to any conclusion . "
53025	53031	53032	53032	Warburton	176	" Yes , I see , "
53038	53302	52852	52852	Franks	160	" And , even if I were sure of understanding her there 's myself . Look at the position , now . I suppose I may call myself a successful man ; well on the way to success , at all events . Unless fortune plays me a dirty trick , I ought soon to be making my three or four thousand a year ; and there 's the possibility of double that . Think what that means , in the way of opportunity . Once or twice , when I was going to see the Crosses , I 've pulled myself up and asked what the deuce I was doing but I went all the same . The truth is , there 's something about Bertha I wish you knew her , Warburton ; I really wish you did . She 's the kind of girl any man might marry . Nothing brilliant about her but well , I ca n't describe it . As different as could be from the other . In fact , it is n't easy to see how they became such close friends . Of course , she knows all about me what I 'm doing , and so on . In the case of an ordinary girl in her position , it would be irresistible ; but I 'm not at all sure that she looks at it in that way . She behaves to one well , in the most natural way possible . Now and then I rather think she makes fun of me . "
53312	53358	53303	53303	Warburton	176	" Why do you laugh ? I do n't mean that she does it disagreeably . It 's her way to look at things on the humorous side and I rather like that . Do n't you think it a good sign in a girl ? "
53359	53363	53365	53365	Will	159	" That depends , "
53367	53395	53303	53303	Warburton	176	" Well , that 's how things are . I wanted to tell you . There 's nobody else I should think of talking to about it . "
53406	53421	53423	53423	Warburton	176	" You 'll have to make up your mind pretty soon , I suppose , "
53433	53459	53533	53533	his	159	" That 's the worst of it . I do n't want to be in a hurry it 's just what I do n't want . "
53460	53468	53470	53470	Will	159	" Does n't it occur to you , "
53481	53495	53470	53470	Will	159	" that perhaps she 's no more in a hurry than you are ? "
53496	53516	53533	53533	his	159	" It 's possible . I should n't wonder . But if I seem to be playing the fool ? "
53517	53525	53526	53526	Will	159	" That depends on yourself . But , "
53536	53551	53526	53526	Will	159	" there 's just one piece of advice I should like to offer you . "
53552	53558	53560	53561	the other	404	" Let me have it , "
53564	53578	53560	53561	the other	404	" Very good of you , old man , not to be bored . "
53579	53583	53585	53585	Warburton	176	" Do n't , "
53592	53603	53585	53585	Warburton	176	" do n't persuade Mrs. Cross to change her grocer . "
53817	53820	53821	53821	he	159	" Idiot ! "
53833	53839	53841	53842	the assistant	972	" You see , sir , "
53844	53859	53841	53842	the assistant	972	" It 's just as I said ; but I could n't persuade you . "
53870	53884	53886	53886	Allchin	161	" There 'll be a net loss of ten pounds on that transaction , "
53888	53912	53886	53886	Allchin	161	" It 's a principle of honest business , never buy a bankrupt stock . But you would n't listen to me , sir "
53913	53924	53927	53928	the master	1343	" That 'll do , Allchin , that 'll do ! "
53939	53956	53927	53928	the master	1343	" Ca n't you see I 'm not in a mood for that sort of thing ? "
54316	54319	54328	54328	he	159	" Warburton ? "
54332	54378	54328	54328	he	159	" Good fellow . Every day this week I 've been wanting to ask you to come ; but I was afraid ; it 's so long since we saw you , I fancied you must have been bored the last time you were here . "
54448	54457	54458	54458	he	170	" Kind fellow , to come like this , "
54462	54593	54458	54458	he	170	" You see that the old enemy has a grip on me . He pinches , he pinches . He 'll get at my vitals one of these days , no doubt . And I 've not even the satisfaction of having got my gout in an honourable way . If it had come to me from a fine old three - bottle ancestor ! But I , who never had a grandfather , and hardly tasted wine till I was thirty years old why , I feel ashamed to call myself gouty . Sit down , my wife 's at church . Strange thing that people still go to church but they do , you know . Force of habit , force of habit . Rosamund 's with her . "
54594	54598	54600	54600	Warburton	176	" Miss Elvan ? "
54605	54650	54458	54458	he	170	" Ah , yes I forgot you did n't know she was here . Came back with those friends of hers from Egypt a week ago . She has no home in England now ; do n't know where she will decide to live . "
54651	54658	54660	54661	Mr. Pomfret	233	" Have you seen Norbert lately ? "
54668	54752	54660	54661	Mr. Pomfret	233	" He 's too busy to come out to Ashtead , perhaps too prosperous . But no , I wo n't say that ; I wo n't really think it . A good lad , Norbert better , I suspect , than his work . There 's a strange thing now ; a painter without enthusiasm for art . He used to have a little ; more than a little ; but it 's all gone . Or so it seems to me . "
54753	54761	54763	54763	Warburton	176	" He 's very honest about it , "
54765	54790	54763	54763	Warburton	176	" Makes no pretences calls his painting a trick , and really feels surprised , I 'm sure , that he 's so successful . "
54791	54832	54660	54661	Mr. Pomfret	233	" Poor Norbert ! A good lad , a good lad . I wonder do you think if I wrote a line , mentioning , by the way , that Rosamund 's here , do you think he 'd come ? "
54858	54866	54867	54867	he	159	" How long will Miss Elvan stay ? "
54870	54887	54660	54661	Mr. Pomfret	233	" Oh , as long as she likes . We are very glad to have her . "
54895	54902	54904	54904	Ralph	170	" A pity , a pity ! "
54912	54919	54904	54904	Ralph	170	" Do n't you think so ? "
54920	54931	54888	54888	Their	1366	" Why , yes . I 've always thought so . "
54972	54976	54978	54978	Ralph	170	" Heaven forbid ! "
54980	55019	54978	54978	Ralph	170	" that one should interfere where lives are at stake ! Nothing of that , nothing of that . You are as little disposed for it as I am . But simply to acquaint him with the fact ? "
55020	55031	55066	55066	Warburton	176	" I see no harm . If I met him ? "
55032	55045	54978	54978	Ralph	170	" Ah ! To be sure . It would be natural to say "
55046	55053	55055	55055	Will	159	" I owe him a visit , "
55583	55592	55594	55595	the hostess	1383	" You have your pipe , I hope ? "
55608	55612	55600	55600	himself	176	" I have . "
55613	55617	55594	55595	the hostess	1383	" And matches ? "
55618	55627	55600	55600	himself	176	" Yes No ! The box is empty . "
55628	55646	55594	55595	the hostess	1383	" I 'll send you some . I have one or two things to see to indoors . "
55729	55742	55744	55744	Rosamund	167	" You often come out to see my uncle , I suppose , "
55746	55762	55711	55711	They	1381	" Not often , I 'm seldom free , and not always in the humour . "
55763	55771	55711	55711	They	1381	" Not in the humour for this ? "
55772	55781	55783	55783	Will	159	" It sounds strange , does n't it ? "
55789	55826	55783	55783	Will	159	" When I 'm here , I want to be here always ; winter or summer , there 's nothing more enjoyable in the way of enjoyment that does only good . Do you regret Egypt ? "
55827	55841	55711	55711	They	1381	" No , indeed . I shall never care to go there again . "
55842	55847	55783	55783	Will	159	" Or the Pyrenees ? "
55848	55855	55857	55857	Rosamund	167	" Have you seen them yet ? "
55864	55870	55871	55871	she	167	" I remember your saying , "
55874	55887	55871	55871	she	167	" you would go for your next holiday to the Basque country . "
55888	55911	55859	55859	Will	159	" Did I ? Yes when you had been talking much about it . But since then I 've had no holiday . "
55912	55919	55871	55871	she	167	" No holiday all this time ? "
55927	55939	55941	55941	Will	159	" How long is it since we were together in Switzerland ? "
55948	55977	55941	55941	Will	159	" This is the second summer , is n't it ? One loses count of time , there in London . I was saying to Franks the other day "
56025	56033	56013	56013	she	167	" You were saying to Mr. Franks ? "
56067	56079	56038	56038	her	167	" I was saying oh , I forget it 's gone . "
56080	56087	56088	56088	Rosamund	167	" Do you often see him ? "
56097	56119	56038	56038	her	167	" Now and then . He 's a busy man , with a great many friends like most men who succeed . "
56120	56146	56038	56038	her	167	" But you do n't mean , I hope , that he cares less for his friends of the old time , before he succeeded ? "
56147	56152	56154	56154	Will	159	" Not at all , "
56167	56211	56154	56154	Will	159	" He 's the same as ever . It 's my fault that we do n't meet oftener . I was always a good deal of a solitary , you know , and my temper has n't been improved by ill - luck . "
56212	56217	56038	56038	her	167	" Ill - luck ? "
56239	56300	56228	56228	her	167	" That 's neither here nor there . We were talking of Franks . If anything , he 's improved , I should say . I ca n't imagine any one bearing success better just the same bright , good - natured , sincere fellow . Of course , he enjoys his good fortune he 's been through hard times . "
56301	56316	56318	56318	Rosamund	167	" Which would have been harder still , but for a friend of his , "
56395	56406	56407	56407	he	1386	" Have you seen Miss Cross since you came back ? "
56414	56512	56407	56407	he	1386	" Oh , yes . If I stay in England , I hope to live somewhere near her . Perhaps I shall take rooms in London , and work at water - colours and black - and - white . Unless I go to the Basque country , where my sister is . Do n't you think , Mr. Warburton , one might make a lot of drawings in the Pyrenees , and then have an exhibition of them in London ? I have to earn my living , and I must do something of that kind . "
56581	56593	56594	56594	he	156	" Well , I shall hear what you decide to do , "
56599	56614	56594	56594	he	156	" If you go to the Pyrenees but I do n't think you will . "
56615	56626	56628	56629	the girl	2296	" No , perhaps not . London rather tempts me , "
56634	56642	56594	56594	he	156	" I 'm glad to hear it . "
56643	56654	56594	56594	he	156	" I must get Bertha 's advice Miss Cross ' . "
56753	56757	56759	56759	Franks	160	" Nothing amiss ? "
56777	56791	56834	56834	Warburton	156	" All right . Came to ask for news , that 's all . "
56792	56805	56834	56834	Warburton	156	" News ? Ah , I understand . There 's no news . "
56806	56810	56834	56834	Warburton	156	" Still reflecting ? "
56811	56833	56834	56834	Warburton	156	" Yes . Keeping away , just to see how I like it . Sensible that , do n't you think ? "
56894	56907	56909	56909	Franks	160	" By Jove , I ought to go and see those people , "
56911	56919	56921	56922	the other	404	" Better wait a little , perhaps , "
56927	56934	56921	56922	the other	404	" Miss Elvan is with them . "
56935	56948	56950	56950	Franks	160	" Ah ! Lucky you told me not that it matters much , "
56958	56985	56950	56950	Franks	160	" at all events as far as I 'm concerned . But it might be a little awkward for her . How long is she staying ? "
57044	57052	57054	57054	Franks	160	" You had a lot of talk ? "
57056	57104	57054	57054	Franks	160	" Oh , we gossiped in the garden . Poor old Pomfret has his gout , and could n't come out with us . What do you think , by the bye , of her chance of living by art ? She says she 'll have to . "
57105	57116	57117	57117	Franks	160	" By that , or something else , no doubt , "
57121	57137	57117	57117	Franks	160	" I know her father had nothing to leave , nothing to make an income . "
57138	57147	57054	57054	Franks	160	" Are her water - colours worth anything ? "
57148	57217	57117	57117	Franks	160	" Not much , I 'm afraid , I ca n't quite see her living by anything of that sort . She 's the amateur , pure and simple . Now , Bertha Cross there 's the kind of girl who does work and gets paid for it . In her modest line , Bertha is a real artist . I do wish you knew her , Warburton . "
57218	57228	57230	57230	Will	159	" So you have said a good many times , "
57232	57250	57230	57230	Will	159	" But I do n't see how it would help you . I know Miss Elvan , and "
57261	57265	57267	57267	Franks	160	" And what ? "
57270	57283	57117	57117	Franks	160	" Nothing except that I like her better than I used to . "
57292	57322	57288	57288	he	159	" Well , I ca n't stay . It 's raining like the devil . I wanted to know whether you 'd done anything decisive , that 's all . "
57323	57333	57335	57335	Franks	160	" I 'll let you know when I do , "
57341	57349	57335	57335	Franks	160	" Good - night , old man . "
57390	57403	57404	57404	he	156	" I 'm afraid you 're not feeling quite yourself , sir , "
57412	57424	57404	57404	he	156	" I 've noticed lately you do n't seem quite well . "
57425	57442	57335	57335	Franks	160	" Have you ? Well , perhaps you are right . But it does n't matter . "
57443	57452	57454	57455	the assistant	972	" If you 'll excuse me , sir , "
57457	57496	57454	57455	the assistant	972	" I 'm afraid it does matter . I hope , sir , you wo n't think I speak disrespectful , but I 've been noticing that you did n't seem to care about waiting on customers lately . "
57497	57503	57335	57335	Franks	160	" You 've noticed that ? "
57504	57620	57454	57455	the assistant	972	" I have , sir , if the truth must be told . And I kept saying to myself as it was n't like you . What I 'm afraid of , sir , if you do n't mind me saying it , is that the customers themselves are beginning to notice it . Mrs. Gilpin said to me yesterday ' What 's come to Mr. Jollyman ? ' she says . ' He has n't a civil word for me ! ' she says . Of course , I made out as you 'd been suffering from a bad ' eadache , and I should n't wonder if that 's the truth , sir . "
57629	57644	57646	57646	Allchin	161	" You would n't like to take just a little ' oliday , sir ? "
57648	57674	57646	57646	Allchin	161	" This next week , I could manage well enough . It might do you good , sir , to have a mouthful of sea air "
57675	57682	57689	57689	He	156	" I 'll think about it , "
57725	57733	57734	57734	he	156	" You 're quite right , Allchin , "
57741	57769	57734	57734	he	156	" I 'm not quite up to the mark , and perhaps I should do well to take a holiday . Thank you for speaking about it . "
57794	57802	57804	57805	the artist	329	" I have as good as decided , "
57807	57906	57804	57805	the artist	329	" Yesterday , I went to Ashtead , and saw R. We met like old friends just as I wished . Talked as naturally as you and I. I suspect only suspect of course that she knows of my visits to Walham Green , and smiles at them ! Yes , as you say , I think she has improved decidedly . The upshot of it all is that I shall call on the Crosses again , and , when an opportunity offers , try my chance . I think I am acting sensibly , do n't you ? "
58787	58811	58782	58782	Franks	160	" Nothing definite yet . Shall come to see you late one of these evenings . I have not been to Walham Green . "
58937	58945	58947	58948	Miss Elvan	164	" You were coming to see us ? "
58954	58974	58947	58948	Miss Elvan	164	" What a pity that I have to go to town ! Only just time to catch the train . "
58975	58989	58914	58921	a female figure just in front of him	1446	" Then I 'll walk back to the station with you may I ? "
58990	59033	58947	58948	Miss Elvan	164	" I shall be delighted , if you do n't mind the trouble . I have an appointment with Miss Cross . She has found rooms which she thinks will suit me , and we 're going to look at them together . "
59034	59042	58914	58921	a female figure just in front of him	1446	" So you have decided for London ? "
59043	59126	58947	58948	Miss Elvan	164	" I think so . The rooms are at Chelsea , in Oakley Crescent . I know how fond you are of London , and how well you know it . And I know so little ; only a street or two here and there . I mean to remedy my ignorance . If ever you have an afternoon to spare , Mr. Warburton , I should be so glad if you would let me go with you to see interesting places . "
59192	59206	59184	59184	her	167	" I may be settled in a day or two . You will hear "
59319	59444	59310	59310	Will	159	" Yes , yes ; she 's off to London town wants to live there , like all the rest of the young people . In thirty years ' time she 'll have had enough of it , and be glad to creep into a quiet corner like this . My wife 's in the house , teaching our new maid to make tea - cakes you shall have some at five o'clock . I wonder whether any girl could be found nowadays who knows how to make tea - cakes ? There 's Rosamund she knows no more about that kind of thing than of ship - building . Do you know any young lady who could make a toothsome tea - cake ? "
59445	59452	59454	59454	Will	159	" I 'm not quite sure , "
59457	59473	59454	59454	Will	159	" but I have one in mind who perhaps does it would n't surprise me . "
59474	59493	59310	59310	Will	159	" That 's to your credit . By the bye , you know that Norbert has been here . "
59494	59508	59454	59454	Will	159	" Yes , I heard of it . He wrote to tell me . "
59509	59527	59310	59310	Will	159	" Aye , but he 's been twice did you know that ? He was here yesterday . "
59528	59531	59454	59454	Will	159	" Indeed ? "
59542	59553	59554	59554	he	170	" One might have expected a little awkwardness between them , "
59557	59619	59554	59554	he	170	" Not a bit of it . There again your girl of to - day ; she has a way of her own with all this kind of thing . Why they just shook hands as if they 'd never been anything but pleasant friends . All the same , as I tell you , Norbert has been a second time . "
59620	59628	59630	59630	Warburton	156	" I 'm glad to hear it , "
59842	59988	59989	59989	Will	159	" The father of the man who owes me ten thousand pounds is dying . Off and on he has been ill for a long time , but I hear at length that there can be no doubt whatever that the end is near . I ca n't pretend to any human feeling in this matter ; the man 's death means life for us so the world goes . Any day now , you may have a telegram from me announcing the event . Of the prompt payment of the debt as soon as my friend inherits , there is no shadow of doubt . I therefore urge you very strongly not to make a disclosure . It will be needless . Wait till we see each other . I am still in Ireland for a reason which I will explain when we meet . "
60130	60134	60107	60107	she	167	" Norbert Franks . "
60189	60204	60206	60206	Rosamund	167	" It 's enough to save one from worry for a year or two , "
60212	60244	60206	60206	Rosamund	167	" I 'm not extravagant ; I can live here very comfortably . And there 's a pleasure in the thought that one 's work not only may succeed but must . "
60245	60253	60255	60255	Bertha	183	" I 'm sure I hope so , "
60257	60264	60255	60255	Bertha	183	" but where 's the must ? "
60265	60276	60282	60282	her	164	" What am I to do if it does n't ? "
60294	60297	60299	60301	her humorous friend	1472	" True , "
60303	60314	60299	60301	her humorous friend	1472	" There 's no other way out of the difficulty . "
60364	60372	60374	60374	Rosamund	167	" These things have cost so little , "
60379	60682	60374	60374	Rosamund	167	" And yes , I was obliged to buy this little tea service ; I really could n't use Mrs. Darby 's ; it spoilt the taste of the tea . Trifles , but they really have their importance ; they help to keep one in the right mind . Oh , I must show you an amusing letter I 've had from Winnie . Winifred is prudence itself . She would n't spend a sixpence unnecessarily . ' Suppose one fell ill , ' she writes , ' what a blessing it would be to feel that one was n't helpless and dependent . Oh , do be careful with your money , and consider very , very seriously what is the best course to take in your position . ' Poor , dear old Winnie ! I know she frets and worries about me , and pictures me throwing gold away by the handful . Yet , as you know , that is n't my character at all . If I lay out a few sovereigns to make myself comfortable here , I know what I 'm doing ; it 'll all come back again in work . As you know , Bertha , I 'm not afraid of poverty not a bit ! I had very much rather be shockingly poor , living in a garret and half starved , than just keep myself tidily going in lodgings such as these were before I made the little changes . Winnie has a terror of finding herself destitute . She jumped for joy when she was offered that work , and I 'm sure she 'd be content to live there in the same way for years . She feels safe as long as she need n't touch her money . "
60732	60737	60739	60739	Rosamund	167	" The one thing , "
60741	60809	60739	60739	Rosamund	167	" that I really dread , is the commonplace . If I were utterly , wretchedly , grindingly poor , there 'd be at all events a savour of the uncommon about it . I ca n't imagine myself marrying a prosperous shopkeeper ; but if I cared for a clerk who had nothing but a pound a week , I would marry him to - morrow . "
60810	60814	60816	60816	Bertha	183	" The result , "
60818	60824	60816	60816	Bertha	183	" might be lamentably commonplace . "
60825	60845	60846	60846	She	183	" Not if it was the right sort of man . Tell me what you think of that bit . "
60853	60862	60846	60846	She	183	" It 's in the valley of Bidassoa . "
60880	60891	60871	60871	Rosamund	167	" Do n't you think Norbert has behaved very well . "
60892	60896	60816	60816	Bertha	183	" How well ? "
60897	61005	60871	60871	Rosamund	167	" I mean , it would have been excusable , perhaps , if he had betrayed a little unkind feeling toward me . But nothing of the kind , absolutely nothing . I 'm afraid I did n't give him credit for so much manliness . When he came to Ashtead the second time , of course I understood his motive at once . He wished to show me that his behaviour at the first meeting was n't mere bravado and to assure me that I need n't be afraid of him . There 's a great deal of delicacy in that ; it really pleased me . "
61018	61025	61026	61026	she	183	" You 're a queer girl , "
61029	61034	60871	60871	Rosamund	167	" Queer ? Why ? "
61035	61054	60871	60871	Rosamund	167	" Do you mean that you were really and truly surprised that Mr. Franks behaved like a gentleman ? "
61055	61060	61062	61063	the other	404	" Oh , Bertha ! "
61065	61070	61062	61063	the other	404	" What a word ! "
61071	61080	60871	60871	Rosamund	167	" Well , like a man , then . "
61081	61091	61093	61093	Rosamund	167	" Perhaps I ought n't to have felt that , "
61096	61120	61093	61093	Rosamund	167	" But I did , and it meant a good deal . It shows how very right I was when I freed myself . "
61121	61129	61131	61131	Bertha	183	" Are you quite sure of that ? "
61143	61152	61093	61093	Rosamund	167	" I never was more sure of anything . "
61153	61171	61093	61093	Rosamund	167	" Do you know , I ca n't help thinking it an argument on the other side . "
61180	61193	61196	61196	Bertha	183	" Suppose it means that you were altogether mistaken about Mr. Franks ? "
61208	61218	61220	61220	Rosamund	167	" I was n't mistaken in my own feeling , "
61226	61270	61222	61222	her	167	" No ; but your feeling , you have always said , was due to a judgment you formed of Mr. Franks ' character and motives . And now you confess that it looks very much as if you had judged him wrongly . "
61278	61283	61285	61285	Bertha	183	" Do you know , "
61291	61302	61285	61285	Bertha	183	" that he has been coming to our house lately ? "
61303	61319	61271	61271	Rosamund	167	" You never mentioned it . But why should n't he go to your house ? "
61320	61327	61329	61329	Bertha	183	" Rather , why should he ? "
61335	61355	61329	61329	Bertha	183	" Do n't trouble to guess . The reason was plain enough . He came to talk about you . "
61356	61359	61361	61362	the listener	746	" Oh ! "
61367	61413	61329	61329	Bertha	183	" There 's no doubt of it ; no shadow of doubt . In fact , we 've had very pleasant little chats about you . Of course I said all the disagreeable things I could ; I knew that was what you would wish . "
61414	61417	61420	61420	Rosamund	167	" Certainly , "
61422	61463	61329	61329	Bertha	183	" I did n't positively calumniate you , but just the unpleasant little hints that a friend is so well able to throw out ; the sort of thing likely to chill any one . I hope you quite approve ? "
61464	61467	61329	61329	Bertha	183	" Quite . "
61468	61508	61329	61329	Bertha	183	" Well , the odd thing was that they did n't quite have the effect I aimed at . He talked of you more and more , instead of less and less . Was n't it provoking , Rosamund ? "
61514	61518	61520	61521	Miss Elvan	164	" I wish , "
61523	61541	61520	61521	Miss Elvan	164	" I knew how much of this is truth , and how much Bertha 's peculiar humour . "
61542	61569	61329	61329	Bertha	183	" It 's substantial truth . That there may be humour in it , I do n't deny , but it is n't of my importing . "
61570	61580	61581	61581	Rosamund	167	" When did he last come to see you ? "
61584	61597	61329	61329	Bertha	183	" Let me see . Just before he went to see you . "
61598	61606	61608	61608	Rosamund	167	" It does n't occur to you , "
61613	61630	61608	61608	Rosamund	167	" that he had some other reason not the apparent one for coming to your house ? "
61631	61646	61648	61648	Bertha	183	" It does n't occur to me , and never will occur to me , "
61730	61745	61746	61746	she	164	" I must get Mr. Warburton to come and walk about Chelsea with me , "
61749	61753	61834	61834	Her	183	" Mr. Warburton ? "
61754	61784	61746	61746	she	164	" He 's a great authority on London antiquities . Bertha , if you happen to see Norbert these days , do ask him for Mr. Warburton 's address . "
61785	61794	61796	61796	Bertha	183	" Why not ask your people at Ashtead ? "
61798	61824	61746	61746	she	164	" I sha n't be going there for two or three weeks . Promise to ask Norbert will you ? For me , of course . "
61841	61850	61851	61851	she	183	" I 'll try to think of it , "
61858	61865	61867	61867	Rosamund	167	" He 's a great mystery , "
61872	61954	61867	61867	Rosamund	167	" My uncle has no idea what he does , and Norbert , they tell me , is just as ignorant , or at all events , professes to be . Is n't it a queer thing ? He came to grief in business two years ago , and since then he has lived out of sight . Uncle Ralph supposes he had to take a clerk 's place somewhere , and that he does n't care to talk about it . "
61955	61962	61964	61964	Bertha	183	" Is he such a snob ? "
61968	61987	61867	61867	Rosamund	167	" No one would think so who knows him . I 'm convinced there 's some other explanation . "
61988	61997	61999	61999	Bertha	183	" Perhaps the truth is yet more awful , "
62002	62013	61999	61999	Bertha	183	" He may have got a place in a shop . "
62014	62019	62021	62022	the other	404	" Hush ! hush ! "
62029	62112	62021	62022	the other	404	" Do n't say such things ! A poor clerk is suggestive it 's possible to see him in a romantic light but a shopman ! If you knew him , ' you would laugh at the idea . Mystery suits him very well indeed ; to tell the truth , he 's much more interesting now than when one knew him as a partner in a manufactory of some kind . You see he 's unhappy there are lines in his face "
62113	62116	62118	62118	Bertha	183	" Perhaps , "
62120	62133	62118	62118	Bertha	183	" he has married a rich widow and dare n't confess it . "
62193	62203	62205	62205	Sherwood	177	" I came first of all at nine o'clock , "
62207	62232	62205	62205	Sherwood	177	" The landlady said you would n't be back before midnight , so I came again . Been to the theatre , I suppose ? "
62233	62236	62238	62238	Will	159	" Yes , "
62240	62254	62238	62238	Will	159	" taking part in a play called ' The Grocer 's Saturday Night . '
62255	62285	62205	62205	Sherwood	177	" I 'd forgotten . Poor old fellow ! You wo n't have much more of that thank Heaven ! Are you too tired to talk to - night ? "
62286	62294	62238	62238	Will	159	" No , no ; come in . "
62378	62387	62389	62389	Will	159	" What 's been the matter with you ? "
62391	62414	62389	62389	Will	159	" Your letter said you had had an illness , and you look as if you had n't got over it yet . "
62415	62424	62426	62427	the other	404	" Oh , I 'm all right now , "
62429	62670	62426	62427	the other	404	" Liver got out of order or the spleen , or something I forget . The best medicine was the news I got about old Strangwyn . There , by Jove ! I 've let the name out . The wonder is I never did it before , when we were talking . It does n't matter now . Yes , it 's Strangwyn , the whisky man . He 'll die worth a million or two , and Ted is his only son . I was a fool to lend that money to Ted , but we saw a great deal of each other at one time , and when he came asking for ten thousand a mere nothing for a fellow of his expectations nobody thought his father could live a year , but the old man has held out all this time , and Ted , the rascal , kept swearing he could n't pay the interest on his debt . Of course I could have made him ; but he knew I should n't dare to risk the thing coming to his father 's ears . I 've had altogether about three hundred pounds , instead of the four hundred a year he owed me it was at four per cent . Now , of course , I shall get all the arrears but that wo n't pay for all the mischief that 's been done . "
62671	62676	62678	62678	Will	159	" Is it certain , "
62680	62686	62678	62678	Will	159	" that Strangwyn will pay ? "
62687	62705	62426	62427	the other	404	" Certain ? If he does n't I sue him . The case is plain as daylight . "
62706	62720	62678	62678	Will	159	" There 's no doubt that he 'll have his father 's money ? "
62721	62973	62426	62427	the other	404	" None whatever . For more than a year now , he 's been on good terms with the old man . Ted is a very decent fellow , of his sort . I do n't say that I care as much for him now as I used to ; we 've both of us altered ; but his worst fault is extravagance . The old man , it must be confessed , is n't very good form ; he smells rather of the distillery ; but Ted Strangwyn might come of the best family in the land . Oh , you need n't have the least anxiety . Strangwyn will pay , principal and interest , as soon as the old man has retired ; and that may happen any day , any hour . How glad I am to see you again , Will ! I 've known one or two plucky men , but no one like you . I could n't have gone through it ; I should have turned coward after a month of that . Well , it 's over , and it 'll be something to look back upon . Some day , perhaps , you 'll amuse your sister by telling her the story . To tell you the truth , I could n't bear to come and see you ; I should have been too miserably ashamed of myself . And not a soul has found you out , all this time ? "
62974	62982	62678	62678	Will	159	" No one that I know of . "
62983	63003	63004	63004	He	1503	" You must have suffered horribly from loneliness . But I have things to tell you , important things . "
63009	63027	63004	63004	He	1503	" Not to - night ; it 's too late , and you look tired to death . "
63028	63032	63034	63034	Warburton	156	" Tell on , "
63036	63051	63034	63034	Warburton	156	" If I went to bed I should n't sleep where are you staying ? "
63052	63063	63064	63064	Sherwood	177	" Morley 's Hotel . Not at my own expense , "
63068	63670	63064	63064	Sherwood	177	" I 'm acting as secretary to a man a man I got to know in Ireland . A fine fellow ! You 'll know him very soon . It 's about him that I want to tell you . But first of all , that idea of mine about Irish eggs . The trouble was I could n't get capital enough . My cousin Hackett risked a couple of hundred pounds ; it was all lost before the thing could really be set going . I had a bad time after that , Will , a bad time , I tell you . Yet good results came of it . For two or three months I lived on next to nothing a few pence a day , all told . Of course , if I had let Strangwyn know how badly off I was , he 'd have sent a cheque ; but I did n't feel I had any right to his money , it was yours , not mine . Besides , I said to myself that , if I suffered , it was only what I deserved ; I took it as a sort of expiation of the harm I 'd done . All that time I was in Dublin , I tried to get employment but nobody had any use for me until at last , when I was all but dying of hunger , somebody spoke to me of a certain Milligan , a young and very rich man living in Dublin . I resolved to go and see him , and a lucky day it was . You remember Conolly Bates 's traveller ? Well , Milligan is just that man , in appearance ; a thorough Irishman , and one of the best hearted fellows that ever lived . Though he 's rich I found him living in a very plain way , in a room which looked like a museum , full of fossils , stuffed birds and animals , queer old pictures , no end of such things . Well , I told him plainly who I was , and where I was ; and almost without thinking , he cried out ' What could be simpler ? Come and be my secretary . ' ' You want a secretary ? ' ' I had n't thought of it , ' said Milligan , ' but now it strikes me it 's just what I do want . I knew there was something . Yes , yes , come and be my secretary ; you 're just the man . ' He went on to tell me he had a lot of correspondence with sellers of curiosities , and it bored him to write the letters . Would I come for a couple of hours a day ? He 'd pay me twenty pounds a month . You may suppose I was n't long in accepting . We began the next day , and in a week 's time we were good friends . Milligan told me that he 'd always had weak health , and he was convinced his life had been saved by vegetarianism . I myself was n't feeling at all fit just then ; he persuaded me to drop meat , and taught me all about the vegetarian way of living . I had n't tried it for a month before I found the most wonderful results . Never in my life had I such a clear mind , and such good spirits . It remade me . "
63671	63683	63685	63685	Will	159	" So you 've come to London to hunt for curios ? "
63687	63729	63731	63731	he	1504	" No , no ; let me go on . When I got to know Milligan well , I found that he had a large estate somewhere in Connaught . And , as we talked , an idea came to me . "
63738	63825	63731	63731	he	1504	" ' If I were a landowner on that scale , ' I said , ' do you know what I should do I should make a vegetarian colony ; a self - supporting settlement of people who ate no meat , drank no alcohol , smoked no tobacco ; a community which , as years went on , might prove to the world that there was the true ideal of civilised life health of mind and of body , true culture , true humanity ! ' "
63852	64037	63836	63836	he	1504	" Milligan caught at the idea caught at it eagerly . ' There 's something fine in that ! ' he said . ' Why should n't it be done ? ' ' You 're the man that could do it , ' I told him . ' You 'd be a benefactor to the human race . Isolated examples are all very well , but what we want is an experiment on a large scale , going on through more than one generation . Let children be born of vegetarian parents , brought up as vegetarians , and this in conditions of life every way simple , natural , healthy . This is the way to convert the world . ' So that 's what we 're working at now , Milligan and I. Of course there are endless difficulties ; the thing ca n't be begun in a hurry ; we have to see no end of people , and correspond with the leaders of vegetarianism everywhere . But is n't it a grand idea ? Is n't it worth working for ? "
64043	64051	64053	64053	Sherwood	177	" I want you to join us , "
64056	64066	64038	64038	Warburton	156	" Ho , ho ! That 's another matter . "
64067	64076	64038	64038	Warburton	156	" I shall bring you books to read . "
64077	64088	64038	64038	Warburton	156	" I 've no time . I 'm a grocer . "
64089	64092	64094	64094	Sherwood	177	" Pooh ! "
64096	64225	64094	64094	Sherwood	177	" In a few days you 'll be an independent man . Yes , yes , I know that you 'll have only a small capital , when things are settled ; but it 's just people with a small capital that we want to enlist ; the very poor and the well - to - do will be no use to us . It 's too late to - night to go into details . We have time to talk , plenty of time . That you will join us , I feel sure . Wait till you 've had time to think about it . For my own part , I 've found the work of my life , and I 'm the happiest man living ! "
64680	64685	64687	64687	Sherwood	177	" What 's more , "
64689	64772	64687	64687	Sherwood	177	" I 've seen Ted Strangwyn himself . Nobody could behave better . The old man , he assured me , could n't last more than a day or two , and he promised quite spontaneously , I did n't say a word to pay his debt in full as soon as ever his father 's will was proved , which will be done as quickly as possible . And now , have you thought over what I said the other night ? "
64773	64777	64815	64815	Warburton	156	" Thought yes . "
64778	64814	64687	64687	Sherwood	177	" With not much result , I see . Never mind ; you must have time . I want you to meet Milligan . Could you come to lunch next Sunday ? He invites you . "
65019	65028	65030	65030	Bertha	222	" Please do n't let me keep you , "
65049	65064	65036	65036	Allchin	161	" I only want some some matches , and one or two trifling things . "
65208	65212	65219	65219	him	156	" Dear Mr. Warburton "
65220	65227	65219	65219	him	156	" Sincerely yours , Rosamund Elvan . "
65230	65378	65219	65219	him	156	" Dear Mr. Warburton , I am settled in my lodgings here , and getting seriously to work . It has occurred to me that you might be able to suggest some quaint corner of old London , unknown to me , which would make a good subject for a water - colour . London has been , I am sure , far too much neglected by artists ; if I could mark out a claim here , as the colonists say , I should be lucky . For the present , I am just sketching to get my hand in about Chelsea . To - morrow afternoon , about six o'clock , if this exquisite mellow weather continues , I shall be on the Embankment in Battersea Park , near the Albert Bridge , where I want to catch a certain effect of sky and water . "
65776	65811	65753	65754	His henchman	1409	" Do n't you ' urry back , sir . There 'll be no business as I ca n't manage . Do n't you think of ' urrying . The air'll do you good . "
66014	66021	66022	66022	she	1547	" Do n't look at this , "
66025	66036	66022	66022	she	1547	" It 's too difficult I ca n't get it right "
66116	66124	66125	66125	she	1547	" I must n't be too ambitious , "
66129	66153	66125	66125	she	1547	" The river suggests dangerous comparisons . I want to find little corners of the town such as no one ever thought of painting "
66154	66161	66163	66163	Will	159	" Unless it was Norbert Franks , "
66180	66188	66189	66189	she	1547	" Yes , I had almost forgotten , "
66196	66207	66189	66189	she	1547	" In those days he did some very good things . "
66208	66228	66163	66163	Will	159	" .Some remarkably good things . Of course you know the story of how he and I first met ? "
66229	66247	66189	66189	she	1547	" Oh , yes . Early morning a quiet little street I remember . Where was that ? "
66248	66252	66253	66253	Will	159	" Over yonder . "
66257	66269	66253	66253	Will	159	" I hope he 'll take that up again some day . "
66270	66280	66282	66282	Rosamund	167	" Oh , but let me do it first , "
66286	66353	66282	66282	Rosamund	167	" You must n't rob me of my chance , Mr. Warburton ? Norbert Franks is successful and rich , or going to be ; I am a poor struggler . Of course , in painting London , it 's atmosphere one has to try for above all . Our sky gives value , now and then , to forms which in themselves are utterly uninteresting . "
66354	66440	66253	66253	Will	159	" Exactly what Franks used to say to me . There was a thing I wanted him to try but then came the revolution . It was the long London street , after a hot , fine day , just when the lamps have been lit . Have you noticed how golden the lights are ? I remember standing for a long time at the end of Harley Street , enjoying that effect . Franks was going to try it but then came the revolution . "
66441	66454	66282	66282	Rosamund	167	" For which you mean , Mr. Warburton I was to blame . "
66471	66476	66478	66478	Will	159	" Why , yes , "
66487	66531	66478	66478	Will	159	" though I should n't myself have used that word . You , no doubt , were the cause of what happened , and so , in a sense , to blame for it . But I know it could n't be helped . "
66532	66539	66541	66541	Rosamund	167	" Indeed , it could n't , "
66723	66732	66734	66734	his	156	" You have seen him lately at Ashtead ? "
66738	66799	66734	66734	his	156	" More than once . And I ca n't tell you how glad we were to see each other ! I knew in a moment that he had really forgiven me and I have always wanted to be assured of that . How thoroughly good and straightforward he is ! I 'm sure we shall be friends all our lives . "
66800	66806	66807	66807	he	156	" I agree with you , "
66810	66931	66807	66807	he	156	" that there 's no better fellow living . Till now , I ca n't see a sign of his being spoilt by success . And spoilt in the worst sense , I do n't think he ever will be , happen what may , there 's a simplicity about him which makes his safeguard . But , as for his painting well , I ca n't be so sure , I know little or nothing about it , but it 's plain that he no longer takes his work very seriously . It pleases people they pay large prices for it where 's the harm ? Still , if he had some one to keep a higher ideal before him "
66947	66952	66953	66953	she	167	" We must try , "
66960	66973	66975	66975	Will	159	" Oh , I do n't know that I 'm any use , "
66981	67005	66975	66975	Will	159	" I speak with no authority . But you yes . You might do much . More than any one else possibly could . "
67006	67014	67016	67016	Rosamund	167	" That is exaggerating , Mr. Warburton , "
67018	67079	67016	67016	Rosamund	167	" Even in the old days my influence did n't go for much . You speak of the ' revolution ' caused by by what happened ; but the truth is that the revolution had begun before that . Remember I saw ' Sanctuary ' while he was painting it , and , but we wo n't talk of that . "
67080	67087	67089	67089	Warburton	156	" To tell you the truth , "
67101	67209	67097	67097	his	156	" I saw no harm in ' Sanctuary . ' I think he was quite right to do what he could to earn money . He wanted to be married ; he had waited quite long enough ; if he had n't done something of the kind , I should have doubted whether he was very much in earnest . No , no ; what I call the revolution began when he had lost all hope . At the time he would have given up painting altogether , I believe ; if it had n't been that he owed me money , and knew I wanted it . "
67218	67225	67210	67210	Rosamund	167	" I never heard about that . "
67226	67293	67097	67097	his	156	" Franks would n't talk about it , be sure . He saw me in a hobble I lost everything , all at once and he went to work like a brick to get money for me . And that , when he felt more disposed to poison himself than to paint . Do you think I should criticise the work he did under these circumstances ? "
67294	67311	67210	67210	Rosamund	167	" No , indeed ! Thank you , Mr. Warburton , for telling me that story . "
67312	67324	67325	67325	Rosamund	167	" How exquisite London is at this time of the year ! "
67346	67415	67339	67339	they	1551	" I 'm glad not to be going away . Look at that lovely sky ! Look at the tones of those houses . Oh , I must make use of it all ! Real use , I mean , as splendid material for art , not only for money - making . Do advise me , Mr. Warburton . Where shall I go to look for bits ? "
67424	67430	67431	67431	he	159	" Do you know Camberwell ? "
67434	67440	67431	67431	he	159	" There are good little corners "
67441	67464	67210	67210	Rosamund	167	" I do n't know it at all . Could you I 'm afraid to ask . You could n't spare time ? "
67465	67480	67431	67431	he	159	" Oh yes , easily . That 's to say , during certain hours . "
67481	67490	67210	67210	Rosamund	167	" On Monday say ? In the afternoon ? "
67491	67494	67431	67431	he	159	" Yes . "
67495	67501	67503	67503	Rosamund	167	" How kind of you ! "
67505	67590	67503	67503	Rosamund	167	" If I were only an amateur , amusing myself , I could n't give you the trouble ; but it 's serious I must earn money before long . You see , there 's nothing else I can do . My sister you know I have a sister ? she has taken to teaching ; she 's at St. Jean de Luz . But I 'm no use for anything of that kind . I must be independent . Why do you smile ? "
67591	67622	67623	67623	They	1553	" Not at you , but at myself . I used to say the same thing . But I had no talent of any kind , and when the smash came "
67695	67702	67704	67704	Rosamund	167	" How very hard for you ! "
67706	67712	67713	67713	she	167	" But do n't think , "
67717	67759	67713	67713	she	167	" that I have a weak dread of poverty . Not at all ! So long as one can support oneself . Nowadays , when every one strives and battles for money , there 's a distinction in doing without it . "
68066	68071	68072	68072	he	159	" What is it ? "
68081	68090	68092	68093	his friend	321	" Wanted a talk , that was all , "
68095	68116	68092	68093	his friend	321	" Hope I have n't disturbed you . You told me , you remember , that you preferred coming here . "
68117	68130	68156	68157	The other	404	" All right . I thought you might have news for me . "
68131	68134	68136	68136	Franks	160	" Well , "
68146	68155	68136	68136	Franks	160	" there 's perhaps something of the sort . "
68162	68168	68156	68157	The other	404	" You 've done it . "
68169	68238	68156	68157	The other	404	" No o o ; not exactly . Sit down ; you 're not in a hurry ? I went to Walham Green a few days ago , but Bertha was n't at home . I saw her mother . They 're going away for a fortnight , to Southwold , and I have a sort of idea that I may run down there . I half promised . "
68246	68279	68156	68157	The other	404	" You disapprove ? Speak plainly , old man . What 's your real objection ? Of course I 've noticed before now that you have an objection . Out with it ! "
68280	68288	68156	68157	The other	404	" Have you seen Miss Elvan again ? "
68289	68295	68156	68157	The other	404	" No . Have you ? "
68296	68302	68156	68157	The other	404	" Two or three times . "
68307	68310	68303	68303	Franks	160	" Where ? "
68311	68321	68156	68157	The other	404	" Oh , we 've had some walks together . "
68322	68328	68330	68330	Franks	160	" The deuce you have ! "
68336	68348	68350	68350	Warburton	156	" Do n't you want to know what we talked about , "
68361	68366	68350	68350	Warburton	156	" Principally about you . "
68367	68378	68156	68157	The other	404	" That 's very flattering but perhaps you abused me ? "
68379	68418	68350	68350	Warburton	156	" On the whole , no . Discussed you , yes , and in considerable detail , coming to the conclusion that you were a very decent fellow , and we both of us liked you very much . "
68425	68455	68419	68419	Franks	160	" Que vous etes aimables , tous - les - deux ! You make me imagine I 'm back in Paris . Must I round a compliment in reply ? "
68456	68517	68156	68157	The other	404	" That 's as you like . But first I 'll tell you the upshot of it all , as it shapes itself to me . Has n't it even dimly occurred to you that , under the circumstances , it would be well , say a graceful thing to give that girl a chance of changing her mind again ? "
68518	68522	68419	68419	Franks	160	" What Rosamund ? "
68523	68529	68156	68157	The other	404	" It never struck you ? "
68530	68539	68541	68542	the artist	329	" But , hang it all , Warburton ! "
68544	68570	68541	68542	the artist	329	" How should I have thought of it ? You know very well and then , it 's perfectly certain she would laugh at me . "
68571	68595	68156	68157	The other	404	" It is n't certain at all . And , do you know , it almost seems to me a point of honour . "
68596	68618	68541	68542	the artist	329	" You 're not serious ? This is one of your solemn jokes such as you have n't indulged in lately . "
68619	68626	68628	68628	Will	159	" No , no . Listen , "
68645	68704	68638	68638	he	159	" She is poor , and does n't know how she 's going to live . You are flourishing , and have all sorts of brilliant things before you ; would n't it be a generous thing the kind of thing one might expect of a fellow with his heart in the right place ? You understand me ? "
68712	68723	68707	68707	his	160	" But am I to understand that she expects it ? "
68724	68765	68766	68767	The artist	329	" Not at all . She has n't in the remotest way betrayed such a thought be assured of that . She is n't the sort of girl to do such a thing . It 's entirely my own thought . "
68783	68788	68789	68789	he	160	" How the deuce , "
68792	68813	68789	68789	he	160	" can you come and talk to me like this when you know I 've as good as committed myself ? "
68814	68846	68766	68767	The artist	329	" Yes , and in a wobbling , half - hearted way which means you had no right even to think of committing yourself . You care nothing about that other girl "
68847	68860	68789	68789	he	160	" You 're mistaken . I care a good deal . In fact "
68861	68865	68867	68867	Warburton	156	" In fact , "
68913	68913	68898	68898	You	329	"
68914	68922	68867	68867	Warburton	156	" Well perhaps yes that may be true "
68923	68964	68898	68898	You	329	" Of course it 's true . If you do n't marry her , go in for a prize beauty or for an heiress or anything else that 's brilliant . Think of the scope before a man like you . "
68971	68978	68979	68979	he	160	" Why , that 's true , "
68982	69083	68979	68979	he	160	" I was going to tell you about my social adventures . Who do you think I 've been chumming with ? Sir Luke Griffin the great Sir Luke . He 's asked me down to his place in Leicestershire , and I think I shall go . He 's really a very nice fellow . I always imagined him loud , vulgar , the typical parvenu . Nothing of the kind no one would guess that he began life in a grocer 's shop . Why , he can talk quite decently about pictures , and really likes them . "
69090	69095	69084	69084	Warburton	156	" Has he daughters ? "
69096	69262	69263	69263	Warburton	156	" Three , and no son . The youngest , about seventeen , an uncommonly pretty girl . Well , as you say , why should n't I marry her and a quarter of a million ? By Jove ! I believe I could . She was here with her father yesterday . I 'm going to paint the three girls together . Do you know , Warburton , speaking without any foolish vanity , what astonishes me is to think of the enormous choice of wives there is for a man of decent appearance and breeding who succeeds in getting himself talked about . Without a joke , I am convinced I know twenty girls , and more or less nice girls , who would have me at once , if I asked them . I 'm not a conceited fellow am I now ? I should n't say this to any one else . I 'm simply convinced of its being a fact . "
69269	69273	69274	69274	he	156	" Seeing that , "
69277	69320	69274	69274	he	156	" why are you in such a hurry ? Your millionaire grocer is but a steppingstone ; who knows but you may soon chum with dukes ? If any man living ought to be cautious about his marriage , it 's you . "
69331	69362	69321	69322	The artist	329	" I should like to know , Warburton , how much of this is satire , and how much serious advice . Perhaps it 's all satire and rather savage ? "
69363	69374	69321	69322	The artist	329	" No , no , I 'm speaking quite frankly . "
69375	69397	69321	69322	The artist	329	" But , look here , there 's the awkward fact that I really have gone rather far with the Crosses . "
69408	69413	69414	69414	he	159	" Do you mean , "
69418	69428	69414	69414	he	159	" that she has committed herself in any way ? "
69429	69438	69440	69440	Franks	160	" No , that she certainly has n't , "
69457	69488	69414	69414	he	159	" My advice then is break decently off , and either do what I suggested , or go and amuse yourself with millionaire Sir Luke , and extend your opportunities . "
69492	69499	69500	69500	he	160	" You are serious about Rosamund ? "
69512	69517	69518	69518	Will	159	" Think it over , "
69527	69585	69518	69518	Will	159	" I saw the thing like that . Of course , it 's no business of mine ; I do n't know why I interfere ; every man should settle these matters in his own way . But it was a thought I had , and I 've told it you . There 's no harm done . "
69671	69914	69635	69635	She	167	" I have seen Norbert again . I call him Norbert , because I always think of him by that name , and there 's an affectation in writing ' Mr. Franks . ' I felt that , when we talked of him , and I really do n't know why I did n't simply call him Norbert then . I shall do so in future . You , I am sure , have little respect for silly social conventions , and you will understand me . Yes , I have seen him again , and I feel obliged to tell you about it . It was really very amusing . You know , of course , that all embarrassment was over between us . At Ashtead we met like the best of friends . So , when Norbert wrote that he wanted to see me , I thought nothing could be more natural , and felt quite glad . But , as soon as we met , I saw something strange in him , something seemed to have happened . And how shall I tell you ? It 's only a guess of mine things did n't come to foolish extremities but I really believe that the poor fellow had somehow persuaded himself that it 's his duty to no , I ca n't go on , but I 'm sure you will understand . I was never so amused at anything .
69915	70042	69658	69658	she	167	" Why do I write this to you ? I hardly know . But I have just a suspicion that the story may not come to you quite as a surprise . If Norbert thought he had a certain duty strange idea ! perhaps friends of his might see things in the same way . Even the most sensible people are influenced by curious ideas on one subject . I need not say that , as soon as the suspicion dawned upon me , I did my best to let him understand how far astray he was going . I think he understood . I feel sure he did . At all events he got into natural talk again , and parted in a thoroughly reasonable way .
70043	70072	69635	69635	She	167	" I beg that you wo n't reply to this letter . I shall work on , and hope to be able to see you again before long . "
70107	70115	70100	70100	he	156	" What 's the matter with me ? "
70124	70167	70100	70100	he	156	" I used to think myself a fellow of some energy ; but the truth is , I know my mind about nothing , and I 'm at the mercy of every one who chooses to push me this way or that . "
70278	70299	70276	70276	Rosamund	167	" Work ready to show you . Could you come and have a cup of tea to - morrow afternoon ? "
70695	70707	70708	70708	Will	159	" No , no , it 's your husband 's turn , "
70714	70724	70708	70708	Will	159	" He wants a holiday more than I do . "
70725	70734	70736	70737	the woman	296	" Allchin want a ' oliday , sir ! "
70739	70877	70736	70737	the woman	296	" Why he never knows what to do with himself when he 's away from business . He enjoys business , does Allchin . Do n't you think of him , sir . I never knew a man so altered since he 's been kept to regular work all the year round . I used to dread the Sundays , and still more the Bank holidays when we were here first ; you never knew who he 'd get quarrelling with as soon as he 'd nothing to do But now , sir , why I do n't believe you 'll find a less quarrelsome man anywhere , and he was saying for a joke only yesterday , that he did n't think he could knock down even a coster , he 's so lost the habit . "
71033	71039	71041	71041	Rosamund	167	" Oh , these sunsets ! "
71055	71067	71068	71068	Will	159	" They used to be my delight when I lived there , "
71074	71085	71068	71068	Will	159	" Show me just where it was , will you ? "
71108	71115	71117	71117	Rosamund	167	" You were very happy there ? "
71119	71149	71098	71098	Warburton	156	" Happy ? Not unhappy , at all events . Yes , in a way I enjoyed my life ; chiefly because I did n't think much about it . "
71150	71158	71098	71098	Warburton	156	" Look at the sky , now . "
71206	71211	71098	71098	Warburton	156	" In other countries , "
71219	71234	71098	71098	Warburton	156	" I have never seen a sky like that . I love this London ! "
71235	71241	71243	71243	Warburton	156	" As I used to , "
71245	71250	71243	71243	Warburton	156	" and shall again . "
71342	71348	71350	71350	Rosamund	167	" I must go in , "
71440	71445	71435	71436	the driver	292	" Keb , sir ? "
71464	71470	71448	71448	he	156	" Where to , sir ? "
71471	71482	71483	71483	he	156	" That 's just what I ca n't tell you , "
71489	71506	71483	71483	he	156	" I want to go to somebody 's house , but do n't know the address . "
71507	71526	71448	71448	he	156	" Could you find it in the Directory , sir ? They 've got one at the corner . "
71527	71531	71483	71483	he	156	" Good idea . "
71617	71621	71612	71613	the child	1605	" having a ride "
71712	71718	71720	71720	Sherwood	177	" Coming to make inquiry ? "
71722	71732	71720	71720	Sherwood	177	" I 've just been doing the same thing . "
71733	71736	71674	71674	He	156	" Well ? "
71737	71755	71720	71720	Sherwood	177	" No better , no worse . But that means , of course , nearer the end . "
71756	71762	71764	71764	Warburton	156	" Queer we should meet , "
71766	71777	71764	71764	Warburton	156	" This is the first time I 've been here . "
71778	71814	71720	71720	Sherwood	177	" I can quite understand your impatience . It seems an extraordinary case ; the poor old man , by every rule , ought to have died weeks ago . Which way are you walking ? "
71829	71842	71844	71844	Godfrey	177	" Let us walk as far as Hyde Park Corner , then , "
71846	71855	71856	71856	He	177	" Delighted to have a talk with you . "
71867	71950	71856	71856	He	177	" Why do n't you come , Will , and make friends with Milligan ? He 's a splendid fellow ; you could n't help taking to him . We are getting on gloriously with our work . For the first time in my life I feel as if I had something to do that 's really worth doing . I tell you this scheme of ours has inconceivable importance ; it may have results such as one dare not talk about . "
71951	71965	71967	71967	Warburton	156	" But how long will it be before you really make a start ? "
71981	72110	71856	71856	He	177	" I ca n't quite say ca n't quite say . The details are of course full of difficulty the thing would n't be worth much if they were not . One of Milligan 's best points is , that he 's a thoroughly practical man thoroughly practical man . It 's no commercial enterprise we 're about , but , if it 's to succeed , it must be started on sound principles . I 'd give anything if I could persuade you to join us , old fellow . You and your mother and sister you 're just the kind of people we want . Think what a grand thing it will be to give a new start to civilisation ! Does n't it touch you ? "
72142	72165	72166	72166	They	1612	" Think it over , Will . We shall have you yet ; I know we shall . Come and see Milligan . "
72199	72209	72210	72210	he	1614	" I want to speak to you , sir , "
72213	72224	72210	72210	he	1614	" about this golden syrup we 've had from Rowbottom 's "
72358	72365	72367	72367	Rosamund	167	" Not like the other evening , "
72454	72464	72470	72470	she	167	" I 've had a letter from Bertha Cross , "
72475	72483	72470	72470	she	167	" She comes home to - morrow . "
72484	72494	72470	72470	she	167	" Bertha Cross ? Ah , yes , your friend "
72611	72623	72592	72592	He	156	" I 'm afraid I must go . It 's really raining "
72646	72651	72652	72652	he	156	" To - morrow , "
72666	72674	72676	72676	Rosamund	167	" Yes , if it 's fine , "
72678	72684	72676	72676	Rosamund	167	" Early in the afternoon ? "
72685	72697	72698	72698	They	1628	" I ca n't . I must go and see Bertha . "
72711	72717	72719	72719	Will	159	" At this hour then , "
72721	72724	72676	72676	Rosamund	167	" Yes . "
72737	72742	72744	72744	Rosamund	167	" I must run , "
72746	72751	72744	72744	Rosamund	167	" Good - bye . "
72838	72844	72846	72846	she	183	" Now , do confess , "
72855	72881	72846	72846	she	183	" This is a little plot of yours all in kindness , of course . You thought it best you somehow brought him to it ? "
72890	72937	72885	72885	Bertha	183	" I have n't seen him for quite a long time . And do you really think this kind of plotting is in my way ? It would as soon have occurred to me to try and persuade Mr. Franks to join the fire - brigade . "
72938	72960	72885	72885	Bertha	183	" Bertha ! You do n't mean anything by that ? You do n't think I am a danger to him ? "
72961	73013	72885	72885	Bertha	183	" No , no , no ! To tell you the truth , I have tried to think just as little about it as possible , one way or the other . Third persons never do any good in such cases , and more often than not get into horrid scrapes . "
73014	73017	73019	73019	Rosamund	167	" Fortunately , "
73032	73082	73019	73019	Rosamund	167	" I 'm sure he is n't serious . It 's his good - nature , his sense of honour . I think all the better of him for it . When he understands that I 'm in earnest , we shall just be friends again , real friends . "
73083	73090	73092	73092	Bertha	183	" Then you are in earnest ? "
73116	73119	73121	73121	Bertha	183	" But , "
73130	73141	73121	73121	Bertha	183	" you have not succeeded in making him understand yet ? "
73142	73188	73099	73099	Rosamund	167	" Perhaps not quite . Yesterday morning I had a letter from him , asking me to meet him in Kensington Gardens . I went , and we had a long talk . Then in the evening , by chance , I saw Mr. Warburton . "
73189	73199	73121	73121	Bertha	183	" Has that anything to do with the matter ? "
73200	73205	73207	73208	Miss Elvan	164	" Oh , no ! "
73211	73234	73207	73208	Miss Elvan	164	" I mention it , because , as I told you once before , Mr. Warburton always likes to talk of Norbert . "
73235	73245	73121	73121	Bertha	183	" I see . And you talked of him ? "
73246	73315	73207	73208	Miss Elvan	164	" We only saw each other for a few minutes . The thunder - storm came on . Bertha , I never knew any one so mysterious as Mr. Warburton . Is n't it extraordinary that Norbert , his intimate friend , does n't know what he does ? I ca n't help thinking he must write . One ca n't associate him with anything common , mean . "
73316	73329	73331	73331	Bertha	183	" Perhaps his glory will burst upon us one of these days , "
73333	73381	73207	73208	Miss Elvan	164	" It really would n't surprise me . He has a remarkable face the kind of face that suggests depth and force . I am sure he is very proud . He could bear any extreme of poverty rather than condescend to ignoble ways of earning money . "
73382	73390	73392	73392	Bertha	183	" Is the poor man very threadbare ? "
73394	73410	73392	73392	Bertha	183	" Has his coat that greenish colour which comes with old age in cheap material ? "
73411	73428	73207	73208	Miss Elvan	164	" You incorrigible ! As far as I have noticed , he is quite properly dressed . "
73429	73434	73436	73436	Bertha	183	" Oh , oh ! "
73443	73492	73436	73436	Bertha	183	" Properly dressed ! What a blow to my romantic imagination ! I thought at least his coat - cuffs would be worn out . And his boots ? Oh , surely he is down at heel ? Do say that he 's down at heel , Rosamund ! "
73493	73503	73505	73506	the other	404	" What a happy girl you are , Bertha , "
73511	73524	73505	73506	the other	404	" I sometimes think I would give anything to be like you . "
73525	73601	73436	73436	Bertha	183	" Ah , but you do n't know you can t see into the gloomy depths , hidden from every eye but my own . For instance , while here we sit , talking as if I had n't a care in the world I am all the time thinking that I must go to Mr. Jollyman 's the grocer 's , that is as we have n't a lump of sugar in the house . "
73602	73610	73612	73612	Rosamund	167	" Then let me walk with you , "
73614	73655	73612	73612	Rosamund	167	" I ought n't to have come worrying you to - day , before you had time to settle down . Just let me walk with you to the grocer 's , and then I 'll leave you at peace . "
73671	73678	73680	73680	Bertha	222	" Here 's Mr. Jollyman 's , "
73682	73693	73680	73680	Bertha	222	" Will you wait for me , or come in ? "
73723	73727	73721	73721	Bertha	222	" Good - morning "
73784	73791	73773	73773	Bertha	222	" Why did you run away ? "
73798	73806	73807	73807	she	167	" Who was that behind the counter ? "
73814	73820	73811	73811	her	167	" Mr. Jollyman . Why ? "
73832	73838	73826	73826	Bertha	222	" What 's the matter ? "
73839	73847	73826	73826	Bertha	222	" Bertha Mr. Jollyman is Mr. Warburton . "
73848	73851	73826	73826	Bertha	222	" Nonsense ! "
73852	73872	73826	73826	Bertha	222	" But he is ! Here 's the explanation here 's the mystery . A grocer in an apron ! "
73887	73897	73898	73898	she	167	" Is n't it a case of extraordinary likeness ? "
73906	73934	73826	73826	Bertha	222	" Oh , dear , no ! I met his eye he showed that he knew me and then his voice . A grocer in an apron ? "
73935	73941	73943	73943	Bertha	222	" This is very shocking , "
73953	73965	73943	73943	Bertha	222	" Let us walk . Let us shake off the nightmare . "
73986	73991	73992	73992	she	167	" But , Bertha ! "
74004	74022	73992	73992	she	167	" He knew you all the time oh , but perhaps he did not know your name ? "
74023	74037	73943	73943	Bertha	222	" Indeed he did . He 's constantly sending things to the house . "
74038	74054	73992	73992	she	167	" How extraordinary ! Did you ever hear such an astonishing thing in your life ? "
74055	74062	74064	74064	Bertha	222	" You said more than once , "
74066	74076	74064	74064	Bertha	222	" that Mr. Warburton was a man of mystery . "
74077	74089	73992	73992	she	167	" Oh , but how could I have imagined ! grocer ! "
74090	74095	73992	73992	she	167	" In an apron ! "
74104	74132	73992	73992	she	167	" But , Bertha , does Norbert know ? He declared he had never found out what Mr. Warburton did . Was that true , or not ? "
74133	74167	73992	73992	she	167	" Ah , that 's the question . If poor Mr. Franks has had this secret upon his soul ! I can hardly believe it . And yet they are such intimate friends . "
74168	74175	74177	74177	Rosamund	167	" He must have known it , "
74696	74700	74703	74703	Warburton	156	" Dear Miss Elvan "
74706	74778	74703	74703	Warburton	156	" I hoped to see you this evening , as we had appointed . Indeed , I must see you , for , as you may imagine , I have much to say . May I come to your house ? In any case , let me know place and hour , and let it be as soon as possible . Reply at once , I entreat you . Ever sincerely yours "
74790	74795	74798	74799	Norbert Franks	160	" Dear , dearest Rosamund "
74800	74909	74798	74799	Norbert Franks	160	" our talk this morning has left me in a state of mind which threatens frenzy . You know I have n't too much patience . It is out of the question for me to wait a week for your answer , though I promised . I ca n't wait even a couple of days . I must see you again to - morrow must , must , must . Come to the same place , there 's a good , dear , sweet , beautiful girl ! If you do n't , I shall be in Oakley Crescent , breaking doors open , behaving insanely . Come early "
75035	75050	75030	75030	she	167	" c o Mrs. Alfred Coppinger , St. Jean de Luz , Basses Pyrenees . "
75060	75069	75071	75071	Rosamund	167	" Please let this be posted at once , "
75712	75718	75723	75724	the landlady	563	" She 's gone away , "
75736	75741	75730	75730	her	563	" Left for good ? "
75742	75747	75749	75750	the woman	296	" Yes , sir , "
75756	75767	75730	75730	her	563	" You do n't know where she has gone to ? "
75768	75787	75730	75730	her	563	" It 's somewhere abroad , sir in France , I think . She has a sister there . "
76154	76207	76210	76210	he	156	" Yes , I am a grocer ; I have lived for a couple of years by selling tea and sugar not to speak of treacle ; but none the less I am the man you drew on to love you . Grocer though I be , I come to claim you ! "
76341	76358	76327	76327	Rosamund	167	" If he loves me as I would be loved , let him dare to follow ! "
76786	76806	76807	76807	His	156	" Oui , oui en effet tres fatigue , horriblement fatiguee ! Trois nuits sans sommeil trois nuits trois ! "
77113	77119	77120	77120	he	156	" I have slept well , "
77128	77162	77120	77120	he	156	" I am hungry . Bring me hot water . And find out , if you can , where lives Mrs. Coppinger . I could n't remember the name last night Mrs. Coppinger . "
77774	77784	77765	77765	he	156	" I think I am speaking to Miss Elvan ? "
77803	77809	77810	77810	he	156	" My name is Warburton , "
77832	77846	77877	77877	she	214	" I have the pleasure of knowing your relatives , the Pomfrets , and "
77847	77860	77862	77862	Winifred	214	" Oh , yes , my sister has often spoken of you , "
77886	77895	77901	77901	he	156	" Your sister is here , I think , "
77916	77932	77901	77901	he	156	" Here ? Oh , no . Not long ago she thought of coming , but "
77965	77970	77971	77971	he	159	" I was mistaken , "
77985	77999	77971	77971	he	159	" Forgive me for intruding myself . I came up here for the view "
78000	78008	78010	78010	Winifred	214	" Yes , is n't it beautiful ! "
78298	78303	78285	78286	a gentleman	889	" Mr. Alfred Coppinger . "
78443	78449	78450	78450	she	1795	" Is it Mr. Warburton ? "
78468	78502	78450	78450	she	1795	" So kind of you to come . My husband will be delighted to see you . How did you get up here on such a day ? Oh , the terrible heat ! "
78551	78557	78558	78558	he	156	" Hoped you would come , "
78565	78703	78558	78558	he	156	" Why did n't you look in yesterday ? Miss Elvan ought to have told you that it does me good to see an Englishman . Here for a holiday ? Blazing hot , but it wo n't last long . South wind . My wife ca n't stand it . She 's here because of the doctors , but it 's all humbug ; there are lots of places in England would suit her just as well , and perhaps better . Let 's have some tea , Alice , there 's a good girl . Mr. Warburton looks thirsty , and I can manage a dozen cups or so . Where 's Winifred ? Let her bring in the kits . They 're getting shy ; it 'll do them good to see a stranger . "
78981	78992	78973	78973	he	159	" Poste Restante , St. Jean de Luz , France , "
79140	79403	79132	79132	He	159	" Dear old boy , why the deuce have you gone away to the end of the earth without letting me know ? I called at your place this evening , and was amazed at the sight of the address which your evil - eyed woman showed me looking as if she feared I should steal it . I wanted particularly to see you . How long are you going to stay down yonder ? Rosamund and I start for our honeymoon on Thursday next , and we shall probably be away for a couple of months , in Tyrol . Does this astonish you ? It ought n't to , seeing that you 've done your best to bring it about . Yes , Rosamund and I are going to be married , with the least possible delay . I 'll tell you all the details some day though there 's very little to tell that you do n't know . Congratulate me on having come to my senses . How precious near I was to making a tremendous fool of myself . It 's you I have to thank , old man . Of course , as you saw , I should never have cared for any one but Rosamund , and it 's pretty sure that she would never have been happy with any one but me . I wanted you to be a witness at our wedding , and now you 've bolted , confound you ! Write to my London address , and it will be forwarded . "
79662	79667	79668	79668	he	159	" Vera , Vera , "
79717	79722	79723	79723	he	159	" Vera , Vera , "
79862	79893	79857	79857	He	159	" Miss Elvan will , of course , know of her sister 's marriage to Norbert Franks . I hear it takes place to - morrow . Very good news . "
80076	80085	80070	80070	he	159	" Come and see me to - night . "
80206	80216	80218	80218	Allchin	161	" He 'll have to put up the shutters , "
80232	80294	80218	80218	Allchin	161	" His wife 's been making a row in the shop again disgraceful scene talk of the ' ole neighbourhood . She began throwing things at customers , and somebody as was badly hit on the jaw with a tin of sardines complained to the police . We shall be rid of him very soon , you 'll see , sir . "
80432	80434	80436	80437	Mrs. Wick	223	" pry "
80471	80478	80479	80479	he	156	" Has Mrs. Cross looked in ? "
80482	80487	80493	80493	she	296	" Yes , sir , "
80518	80518	80506	80506	I	0	"
80519	80528	80493	80493	she	296	" And what did she say to that ? "
80529	80587	80506	80506	I	0	" She said ' Oh ' that 's all , sir . It was a very small order she gave . I ca n't make out how she manages to use so little sugar in her ' ouse . It 's certain the servant does n't have her tea too sweet what do you think , sir ? "
80626	80629	80618	80618	Will	159	" What news ?
80630	80633	80635	80635	Godfrey	177	" News ? "
80645	80651	80635	80635	Godfrey	177	" Have n't you heard ? "
80652	80656	80618	80618	Will	159	" Heard what ? "
80657	80669	80635	80635	Godfrey	177	" But your telegram ? Was n't that what it meant ? "
80670	80676	80678	80678	Will	159	" What do you mean ? "
80680	80710	80678	80678	Will	159	" Speak , man ! I 've been abroad for a week . I know nothing ; I telegraphed because I wanted to see you , that was all . "
80711	80726	80635	80635	Godfrey	177	" Confound it ! I hoped you knew the worst . Strangwyn is dead . "
80727	80744	80678	80678	Will	159	" He 's dead ? Well , is n't that what we 've been waiting for ? "
80745	80751	80753	80753	Sherwood	177	" Not the old man , "
80755	80873	80753	80753	Sherwood	177	" not the old man . It 's Ted Strangwyn that 's dead . Never was such an extraordinary case of bad luck . And his death the most astounding you ever heard of . He was down in Yorkshire for the grouse . The dogcart came round in the morning , and as he stood beside it , stowing away a gun or something , the horse made a movement forward , and the wheel went over his toe . He thought nothing of it . The next day he was ill ; it turned to tetanus ; and in a few hours he died . Did you ever in your life hear anything like that ? "
80905	80914	80915	80915	he	177	" I ca n't help it , Sherwood , "
80918	80933	80915	80915	he	177	" It 's brutal , I know , but I ca n't help it . "
80934	80939	80941	80942	the other	404	" My dear boy , "
80950	80987	80988	80988	he	404	" I 'm delighted you can laugh . Talk about the irony of fate eh ? I could n't believe my eyes when I saw the paragraph in the paper yesterday . But , you know , "
80992	81042	80988	80988	he	404	" I do n't absolutely give up hope . According to the latest news , it almost looks as if old Strangwyn might recover ; and , if he does , I shall certainly try to get this money out of him . If he has any sense of honour "
81052	81056	81057	81057	he	404	" My boy , "
81060	81083	81057	81057	he	404	" it 's all up , and you know it . You 'll never see a penny of your ten thousand pounds . "
81084	81093	81043	81043	Will	159	" Oh , but I ca n't help hoping "
81094	81108	81057	81057	he	404	" Hope as much as you like . How goes the other affair ? "
81109	81222	81043	81043	Will	159	" Why , there , too , odd things have been happening . Milligan has just got engaged , and , to tell you the truth , to a girl I should n't have thought he 'd ever have looked twice at . It 's a Miss Parker , the daughter of a City man . Pretty enough if you like , but as far as I can see , no more brains than a teapot , and I ca n't for the life of me understand how a man like Milligan . But of course , it makes no difference ; our work goes on . We have an enormous correspondence . "
81223	81232	81234	81234	Will	159	" Does Miss Parker interest herself in it ? "
81236	81311	81043	81043	Will	159	" Oh , yes , in a way , you know ; as far as she can . She has turned vegetarian , of course . To tell you the truth , Warburton , it vexes me a good deal . I did n't think Milligan could do such a silly thing . I hope he 'll get married quickly . Just at present , the fact is , he is n't quite himself . "
81319	81334	81335	81335	he	156	" Well , I thought things might have been happening whilst I was away , "
81338	81472	81335	81335	he	156	" and I was n't mistaken . Luckily , I have come back with a renewed gusto for the shop . By the bye , I 'm going to keep that secret no longer . I 'm a grocer , and probably shall be a grocer all my life , and the sooner people know it the better . I 'm sick of hiding away . Tell Milligan the story ; it will amuse Miss Parker , And , talking of Miss Parker , do you know that Norbert Franks is married ? His old love Miss Elvan . Of course it was the sensible thing to do . They 're off to Tyrol . As soon as I have their address , I shall write and tell him all about Jollyman 's . "
81473	81484	81486	81486	Godfrey	177	" Of course , if you really feel you must , "
81491	81513	81486	81486	Godfrey	177	" But remember that I still hope to recover the money . Old Strangwyn has the reputation of being an honourable man "
81514	81518	81521	81521	Warburton	156	" Like Brutus , "
81525	81539	81521	81521	Warburton	156	" Let us hope . Of course we will hope . Hope springs eternal "
81589	81591	81587	81587	his	227	" holiday "
81634	81757	81628	81628	she	1436	" You know how she dreads to give trouble , and can not bear to have any one worry about her . She has seen Dr. Edge twice in the last few days , but not in my presence , and I feel sure that she has forbidden him to tell me the truth about her . I dare not let her guess how anxious I am , and have to go on in my usual way , just doing what I can for her comfort . If you would come over for a day , I should feel very glad . Not having seen mother for some time , you would be better able than I to judge how she looks . "
81822	81826	81828	81828	Jane	202	" I wondered , "
81837	81857	81830	81830	her	202	" And it 's so long since you sent a word ; I should have written again this afternoon . "
81858	81865	81866	81866	he	159	" I 've been abominably neglectful , "
81869	81876	81866	81866	he	159	" and time goes so quickly . "
81877	81886	81888	81889	the girl	2296	" There 's something strange in your look , "
81891	81911	81888	81889	the girl	2296	" What is it , I wonder ? You 've altered in some way I do n't know how . "
81912	81926	81866	81866	he	159	" Think so ? but never mind me ; tell me about mother . "
82088	82123	82161	82161	Will	159	" Will and you find me asleep ? I appeal to Jane ; she will tell you it 's only an accident . Did you ever before see me asleep like this , Jane ? "
82222	82239	82215	82215	she	176	" I am not young , Will , you know . Sixty - five next birthday . "
82240	82249	82251	82252	her son	610	" But you do n't call that old ! "
82254	82299	82300	82300	she	202	" Yes , it 's old for one of my family , dear , None of us , that I know of , lived to be much more than sixty , and most died long before . Do n't let us wear melancholy faces , "
82318	82411	82300	82300	she	202	" You and I , dear , are too sensible , I hope , to complain or be frightened because life must have an end . When my time comes , I trust to my children not to make me unhappy by forgetting what I have always tried to teach them . I should like to think and I know that you would be sorry to lose me ; but to see you miserable on my account , or to think you miserable after I have gone I could n't bear that . "
82503	82513	82515	82516	Mrs. Warburton	176	" I want to speak to you of Jane , "
82525	82551	82515	82516	Mrs. Warburton	176	" You know she went to see her friend , Miss Winter , a few weeks ago . Has she told you anything about it ? "
82552	82557	82515	82516	Mrs. Warburton	176	" Nothing at all . "
82558	82679	82515	82516	Mrs. Warburton	176	" Well , do you know that Miss Winter has taken up flower - growing as a business , and it looks as if she would be very successful . She is renting more land , to make gardens of , and has two girls with her , as apprentices . I think that 's what Jane will turn to some day . Of course she wo n't be really obliged to work for her living , but , when she is alone , I 'm certain she wo n't be content to live just as she does now she is far too active ; but for me , I daresay she would go and join Miss Winter at once . "
82680	82703	82705	82705	Will	159	" I do n't much care for that idea of girls going out to work when they could live quietly at home , "
82707	82716	82718	82719	his mother	346	" I used to have the same feeling , "
82721	82773	82774	82774	she	346	" but Jane and I have often talked about it , and I see there is something to be said for the other view . At all events , I wanted to prevent you from wondering what was to become of her when she was left alone . To be sure , "
82782	82815	82774	82774	she	346	" Jane may marry . I hope she will . But I know she wo n't easily be persuaded to give up her independence . Jane is a very independent little person . "
82816	82824	82826	82826	Will	159	" If she has that in mind , "
82828	82851	82826	82826	Will	159	" why should n't you both go and live over there , in Suffolk ? You could find a house , no doubt "
82859	82875	82852	82853	Mrs. Warburton	176	" I do n't think I could leave The Haws . And for the short time "
82876	82889	82898	82899	Mrs. Warburton	176	" Short time ? but you are not seriously ill , mother . "
82890	82896	82898	82899	Mrs. Warburton	176	" If I get stronger , "
82906	82959	82898	82899	Mrs. Warburton	176	" we must manage to send Jane into Suffolk . I could get along very well alone . But there we have talked enough for this evening , Will . Can you stay over tomorrow ? Do , if you could manage it . I am glad to have you near me . "
83058	83065	83067	83067	her	202	" You are uneasy about mother , "
83071	83101	83067	83067	her	202	" So am I , very . I feel convinced Dr. Edge has given her some serious warning ; I saw the change in her after his last visit . "
83102	83110	83112	83112	Will	159	" I shall go and see him , "
83140	83150	83151	83151	he	159	" I 've something I want to tell you , "
83160	83195	83151	83151	he	159	" It 's a little startling rather ludicrous , too . What should you say if some one came and told you he had seen me serving behind a grocer 's counter in London ? "
83196	83204	83121	83121	Warburton	176	" What do you mean , Will ? "
83205	83223	83151	83151	he	159	" Well , I want to know how it would strike you . Should you be horrified ? "
83224	83230	83121	83121	Warburton	176	" No ; but astonished . "
83231	83243	83245	83245	Warburton	176	" Very well . The fact of the matter is then , "
83252	83271	83245	83245	Warburton	176	" that for a couple of years I have been doing that . It came about in this way "
83319	83328	83329	83329	she	746	" It was brave of you , Will , "
83332	83440	83298	83298	she	746	" Well , I saw no other way of making good the loss ; but now I am sick of living a double life that has really been the worst part of it , all along . What I want to ask you , is would it be wise or not to tell mother ? Would it worry and distress her ? As for the money , you see there 's nothing to worry about ; the shop will yield a sufficient income , though not as much as we hoped from Applegarth 's ; but of course I shall have to go on behind the counter . "
83461	83467	83468	83468	she	202	" That wo n't do , "
83475	83485	83441	83441	He	611	" Oh , I 'm getting used to it . "
83486	83577	83441	83441	He	611	" No , no , Will , it wo n't do . We must find a better way . I see no harm in shopkeeping , if one has been brought up to it ; but you have n't , and it is n't suitable for you . About mother yes , I think we 'd better tell her . She wo n't worry on account of the money ; that is n't her nature , and it 's very much better that there should be confidence between us all . "
83578	83586	83588	83588	Will	159	" I have n't enjoyed telling lies , "
83590	83595	83588	83588	Will	159	" I assure you . "
83596	83624	83441	83441	He	611	" That I 'm sure you have n't , poor boy ! but Mr. Sherwood ? Has n't he made any effort to help you . Surely he "
83625	83630	83633	83634	her brother	611	" Poor old Godfrey ! "
83638	83671	83633	83634	her brother	611	" It 's a joke to remember that I used to think him a splendid man of business , far more practical than I. Why , there 's no dreamier muddlehead living . "
83696	83752	83672	83672	He	611	" No , no ; it 's no good looking in that direction . The money has gone , there 's no help for it . But you can depend on Jollyman 's . Of course the affair would have been much more difficult without Allchin . Oh , you must see Allchin some day ! "
83753	83763	83765	83765	Jane	202	" And absolutely no one has discovered the secret ? "
83772	83927	83672	83672	He	611	" Yes , one person . You remember the name of Miss Elvan ? A fortnight ago imagine the scene she walked into the shop with a friend of hers , a Miss Cross , who has been one of my customers from the first . As soon as she caught sight of me she turned and ran ; yes , ran out into the street in indignation and horror . Of course she must have told her friend , and whether Miss Cross will ever come to the shop again , I do n't know . I never mentioned that name to you , did I ? The Crosses were friends of Norbert Franks . And , by the bye , I hear that Franks was married to Miss Elvan a few days ago just after her awful discovery . No doubt she told him , and perhaps he 'll drop my acquaintance . "
83928	83935	83767	83767	Will	159	" You do n't mean that ? "
83936	84068	83672	83672	He	611	" Well , not quite ; but it would n't surprise me if his wife told him that really one must n't be too intimate with grocers . In future , I 'm going to tell everybody ; there shall be no more hiding and sneaking . That 's what debases a man ; not the selling of sugar and tea . A short time ago , I had got into a vile state of mind ; I felt like poisoning myself . And I 'm convinced it was merely the burden of lies weighing upon me . Yes , yes , you 're quite right ; of course , mother must be told . Shall I leave it to you , Jane ? I think you could break it better . "
84143	84150	84152	84152	his	611	" You have n't told yet ? "
84162	84165	84167	84167	Jane	202	" Why ? "
84170	84189	84152	84152	his	611	" I 'm afraid of the result . Edge says that every sort of agitation must be avoided . "
84190	84196	84198	84198	Jane	202	" I have told her , "
84208	84240	84198	84198	Jane	202	" She was grieved on your account , but it gave her no shock . Again and again she said how glad she was you had let us know the truth . "
84241	84248	84152	84152	his	611	" So far then , good . "
84249	84259	84198	84198	Jane	202	" But Dr. Edge what did he tell you ? "
84260	84281	84152	84152	his	611	" He said he had wanted to see me , and thought of writing . Yes , he speaks seriously . "
84350	84365	84323	84323	her	346	" And you could n't trust me to take my share of the trouble ? "
84366	84373	84375	84376	her son	610	" I knew only too well , "
84378	84388	84375	84376	her son	610	" that your own share would n't content you . "
84389	84469	84323	84323	her	346	" Greedy mother ! Perhaps you were right , Will . I suppose I should have interfered , and made everything worse for you ; but you need n't have waited quite so long before telling me . The one thing that I ca n't understand is Mr. Sherwood 's behaviour . You had always given me such a different idea of him . Really , I do n't think he ought to have been let off so easily . "
84470	84501	84375	84376	her son	610	" Oh , poor old Godfrey ! What could he do ? He was sorry as man could be , and he gave me all the cash he could scrape together "
84502	84514	84516	84517	Mrs. Warburton	176	" I 'm glad he was n't a friend of mine , "
84519	84572	84516	84517	Mrs. Warburton	176	" In all my life , I have never quarrelled with a friend , but I 'm afraid I must have fallen out with Mr. Sherwood . Think of the women who entrust their all to men of that kind , and have no strong son to save them from the consequences . "
84649	84654	84655	84655	she	202	" My dear Will , "
84658	84811	84655	84655	she	202	" I ca n't keep secrets as long as you . This is to inform you that a week ago I let The Haws , on annual tenancy , to a friend of Mr. Turnbull 's , who was looking for such a house . The day after to - morrow we begin our removal to a home which Jane has taken near to Miss Winter 's in Suffolk . That she was able to find just what we wanted at a moment 's notice encourages me in thinking that Providence is on our side , or , as your dear father used to say , that the oracle has spoken . In a week 's time I hope to send news that we are settled . You are forbidden to come here before our departure , but will be invited to the new home as soon as possible . The address is "
84823	84832	84833	84833	she	202	" Do n't be alarmed by the news , "
84836	84957	84833	84833	she	202	" Mother has been so firm in this resolve since the day of your leaving us , that I could only obey her . Wonderful and delightful to tell , she seems better in health . I dare not make too much of this , after what Dr. Edge said , but for the present she is certainly stronger . As you suppose , I am going to work with Miss Winter . Come and see us when we are settled , and you shall hear all our plans . Everything has been done so quickly , that I live in a sort of a dream . Do n't worry , and of course do n't on any account come . "
85119	85129	85152	85152	Warburton	176	" We have been tempted as far as this , "
85135	85151	85152	85152	Warburton	176	" Must be home in ten days . Shall be delighted to see you again . "
85333	85343	85348	85348	she	267	" Queer little house this , is n't it ? "
85354	85381	85345	85346	Mrs. Franks	267	" Everything is sacrificed to the studio ; there 's no room to turn anywhere else . We must look at once for more comfortable quarters . "
85382	85393	85395	85396	the artist	329	" It 's only meant for a man living alone , "
85415	85423	85402	85402	Franks	267	" Yes , we must find something roomier .
85424	85436	85438	85438	Warburton	176	" A score of sitters waiting for you , I suppose ? "
85440	85497	85402	85402	Franks	267	" Oh , several . One of them such an awful phiz that I 'm afraid of her . If I make her presentable , it 'll be my greatest feat yet . But the labourer is worthy of his hire , you know , and this bit of beauty - making will have its price . "
85498	85509	85511	85511	Rosamund	167	" You know how to interpret that , Mr. Warburton , "
85519	85535	85511	85511	Rosamund	167	" Norbert asks very much less than any other portrait painter of his reputation would . "
85536	85546	85547	85547	Will	159	" He 'll grow out of that bad habit , "
85561	85572	85579	85579	her	1912	" I 'm not sure that I wish him to , "
85589	85610	85611	85611	she	1912	" It 's a distinction nowadays not to care for money . Norbert jokes about making an ugly woman beautiful , "
85616	85645	85611	85611	she	1912	" but what he will really do is to discover the very best aspect of the face , and so make something much more than an ordinary likeness . "
85656	85666	85668	85668	Warburton	156	" That 's the work of the great artist , "
85673	85676	85678	85678	Franks	160	" Humbug ! "
85746	85749	85745	85748	The " great artist	3371	" great artist "
85819	85830	85832	85832	Warburton	156	" Why did n't you let me hear from you ? "
85834	85845	85832	85832	Warburton	156	" I got nothing but that flimsy postcard from Venice . "
85846	85856	85858	85859	the artist	329	" Why , I was always meaning to write , "
85861	85874	85858	85859	the artist	329	" I know it was too bad . But time goes so quickly "
85875	85891	85832	85832	Warburton	156	" With you , no doubt . But if you stood behind a counter all day "
85915	85920	85927	85927	he	160	" Behind a counter ? "
85932	85939	85941	85941	Will	159	" The counter ; my counter ! "
85944	85962	85941	85941	Will	159	" You know very well what I mean . Your wife has told you all about it . "
85973	85979	85981	85981	Franks	160	" We did n't know , "
85989	85997	85981	85981	Franks	160	" whether you cared to talk about it "
85998	86043	86064	86064	her	167	" I 'll talk about it with any one you like . So you do know ? That 's all right . I still owe my apology to Mrs. Franks for having given her such a shock . The disclosure was really too sudden . "
86044	86059	86061	86061	Rosamund	167	" It is I who should beg you to forgive me , Mr. Warburton , "
86068	86148	86061	86061	Rosamund	167	" I behaved in a very silly way . But my friend Bertha Cross treated me as I deserved . She declared that she was ashamed of me . But do not , pray do not , think me worse than I was . I ran away really because I felt I had surprised a secret . I was embarrassed , I lost my head . I 'm sure you do n't think me capable of really mean feelings ? "
86149	86155	86158	86159	the artist	329	" But , old man , "
86167	86184	86158	86159	the artist	329	" what the deuce does it all mean ? Tell us the whole story , do . "
86193	86199	86207	86207	Rosamund	167	" I was quite sure , "
86214	86230	86207	86207	Rosamund	167	" that you had some noble motive . I said so at once to Bertha . "
86231	86235	86237	86237	Will	159	" I suppose , "
86239	86251	86237	86237	Will	159	" Miss Cross will never dare to enter the shop again ? "
86252	86258	86207	86207	Rosamund	167	" She does n't come ! "
86259	86263	86264	86264	he	159	" Never since , "
86268	86295	86264	86264	he	159	" Her mother has been once or twice , and seems to regard me with a very suspicious eye . Mrs. Cross was told no doubt ? "
86296	86304	86306	86306	Rosamund	167	" That I really ca n't say , "
86312	86328	86329	86329	she	167	" But does n't it do one good to hear such a story , Norbert ? "
86333	86340	86351	86351	his	2812	" Yes , that 's pluck , "
86366	86379	86351	86351	his	2812	" I know very well that I could n't have done it . "
86496	86569	86485	86485	Rosamund	167	" And you have been in the Basque country since we saw you . I 'm so glad you really took your holiday there at last ; you often used to speak of doing so . And you met my sister Winifred wrote to me all about it . The Coppingers were delighted to see you . Do n't you think them nice people ? Did poor Mrs. Coppinger seem any better ? "
86682	86712	86672	86673	his friend	321	" Let us see you as often as possible , old man . I hope you 'll often come and lunch on Sunday ; nothing could please us better . "
86941	86945	86979	86979	Rosamund	167	" fell in love "
87387	87465	87383	87383	her	168	" Of course we know who did much , if not everything , to bring it about . Rosamund came and told me how beautifully you had pleaded Norbert 's cause , and Norbert confided to my husband that , but for you , he would most likely have married a girl he really did n't care about at all . I doubt whether a mere man ever did such a thing so discreetly and successfully before ! "
87601	87614	87616	87617	Mrs. Wick	223	" There 's a telegram a - waiting for you , sir , "
87629	87636	87616	87617	Mrs. Wick	223	" Mother ill . Please come . "
87798	87805	87790	87791	Her mother	716	" And you laugh about it ? "
87806	87812	87814	87814	Bertha	222	" It 's so amusing , "
87822	87829	87830	87830	she	174	" I do n't understand you , "
87839	87859	87830	87830	she	174	" I do not understand you , Bertha ! All I can say is , behaviour more disgraceful I never "
87925	87939	87941	87941	her	1965	" I never liked to say what I really thought of that girl , "
87945	87961	87941	87941	her	1965	" Now your eyes are opened . Of course you 'll never see her again ? "
87962	87967	87969	87969	Bertha	222	" Why , mother ? "
87971	87995	87969	87969	Bertha	222	" I 'm very glad she has married Mr. Franks . I always hoped she would , and felt pretty sure of it . "
87996	88007	87941	87941	her	1965	" And you mean to be friends with them both ? "
88008	88021	88022	88022	Bertha	222	" Why not ? But do n't let us talk about that , "
88028	88054	88022	88022	Bertha	222	" I should only vex you . There 's something else I want to tell you , something you 'll really be amused to hear . "
88055	88062	87941	87941	her	1965	" Your ideas of amusement , Bertha "
88063	88086	88022	88022	Bertha	222	" Yes , yes , but listen . It 's about Mr. Jollyman . Who do you think Mr. Jollyman really is ? "
88100	88113	87941	87941	her	1965	" And why did n't you tell me this before , pray ? "
88114	88119	88121	88122	the girl	2296	" I hardly know , "
88128	88144	88121	88122	the girl	2296	" Perhaps because I waited to hear more to make the revelation more complete . But "
88145	88149	88151	88152	Mrs. Cross	174	" And this , "
88154	88166	88151	88152	Mrs. Cross	174	" is why you would n't go to the shop yesterday ? "
88167	88170	87941	87941	her	1965	" Yes , "
88176	88186	87941	87941	her	1965	" I do n't think I shall go again . "
88187	88195	88121	88122	the girl	2296	" And , pray , why not ? "
88200	88213	88215	88216	her mother	716	" There 's one very disagreeable thing in your character , Bertha , "
88219	88284	88215	88216	her mother	716	" and that is your habit of hiding and concealing . To think that you found this out more than a week ago ! You 're very , very unlike your father . He never kept a thing from me , never for an hour . But you are always full of secrets . It is n't nice it is n't at all nice . "
88354	88361	88362	88362	she	2296	" I have thought it over , "
88370	88385	88362	88362	she	2296	" and on the whole I had rather not go again to the shop . "
88494	88502	88504	88505	Mrs. Cross	174	" From those people , I suppose ? "
88517	88530	88504	88505	Mrs. Cross	174	" Then I do n't wish to hear one word of it . "
88560	88565	88567	88568	her mother	716	" Well , then , "
88572	88581	88567	88568	her mother	716	" after all , there 's nothing disgraceful . "
88582	88589	88546	88546	She	174	" I never thought there was . "
88590	88601	88567	88568	her mother	716	" Then why have you refused to enter his shop ? "
88602	88607	88609	88609	Bertha	222	" It was awkward , "
88611	88621	88623	88624	Mrs. Cross	174	" No more awkward for you than for me , "
88626	88665	88623	88624	Mrs. Cross	174	" But I 've noticed , Bertha , that you are getting rather selfish in some things I do n't of course say in everything and I think it is n't difficult to guess where that comes from . "
88777	88802	88768	88769	Mrs. Cross	174	" There now ! If that was n't a good idea ! Who do you think sent that girl , Bertha ? Mr. Jollyman . "
88807	88961	88803	88803	Bertha	222	" I had to go into the shop yesterday , and I happened to speak to Mr. Jollyman of the trouble I had in finding a good servant . It occurred to me that he might just possibly know of some one . He promised to make inquiries , and here at once comes the nicest girl I 've seen for a long time . She had to leave her last place because it was too hard ; just fancy , a shop where she had to cook for sixteen people , and see to five bedrooms ; no wonder she broke down , poor thing . She 's been resting for a month or two : and she lives in the same house as a person named Mrs. Hopper , who is the sister of the wife of Mr. Jollyman 's assistant . And she 's quite content with fifteen pounds quite . "
89018	89029	89032	89032	Bertha	222	" I suppose you still address him by that name ? "
89034	89070	89002	89003	Mrs. Cross	174	" That name ? Why , I 'd really almost forgotten that it was n't his real name . In any case , I could n't use the other in the shop , could I ? "
89071	89078	89002	89003	Mrs. Cross	174	" Of course not ; no . "
89079	89088	89002	89003	Mrs. Cross	174	" Now you speak of it , Bertha , "
89093	89106	89002	89003	Mrs. Cross	174	" I wonder whether he knows that I know who he is ? "
89107	89112	89002	89003	Mrs. Cross	174	" Certainly he does . "
89113	89177	89002	89003	Mrs. Cross	174	" When one thinks of it , would n't it be better , Bertha , for you to go to the shop again now and then ? I 'm afraid the poor man may feel hurt . He must have noticed that you never went again after that discovery , and one really would n't like him to think that you were offended . "
89178	89181	89183	89184	the girl	2296	" Offended ? "
89189	89194	89183	89184	the girl	2296	" Offended at what ? "
89195	89223	89002	89003	Mrs. Cross	174	" Oh , some people , you know , might think his behaviour strange using a name that 's not his own , and and so on . "
89224	89254	89183	89184	the girl	2296	" Some people might , no doubt . But the poor man , as you call him , is probably quite indifferent as to what we think of him . "
89255	89277	89002	89003	Mrs. Cross	174	" Do n't you think it would be well if you went in and just thanked him for sending the servant ? "
89278	89281	89283	89283	Bertha	222	" Perhaps , "
89517	89526	89499	89499	her	1991	" Yes , miss , this minute , miss "
89629	89631	89632	89633	a servant	2531	" willing "
89780	89789	89791	89792	Mrs. Cross	174	" I do n't understand you , Bertha , "
89810	89833	89791	89792	Mrs. Cross	174	" What do we engage a servant for ? Are the windows to get so dirty we ca n't see through them ? "
89834	89843	89845	89846	her daughter	477	" They were cleaned not many days ago , "
89848	89864	89845	89846	her daughter	477	" and I think we could manage to see till the weather 's less terrible . "
89865	89940	89791	89792	Mrs. Cross	174	" My dear , if we managed so as to give the servant no trouble at all , the house would soon be in a pretty state . Be so good as not to interfere . It 's really an extraordinary thing that as soon as I find a girl who almost suits me , you begin to try to spoil her . One would think you took a pleasure in making my life miserable "
90038	90112	90030	90030	Bertha	222	" Mother , this wo n't do . I am very sorry to annoy you , but if you call that a dinner for a girl who works hard ten or twelve hours a day , I do n't . How she supports life , I ca n't understand . You have only to look into her face to see she 's starving . I can bear the sight of it no longer . "
90241	90249	90251	90251	Bertha	222	" I have a letter from Emily , "
90269	90280	90251	90251	Bertha	222	" I 'm going to see her to - day . "
90281	90285	90287	90288	Mrs. Cross	174	" Very well , "
90294	90331	90251	90251	Bertha	222	" She says that in the house where she lives , there 's a bed - sitting - room to let . I think , mother , it might be better for me to take it . "
90332	90343	90251	90251	Bertha	222	" You will do just as you please , Bertha . "
90344	90363	90251	90251	Bertha	222	" I shall have dinner to - day with Emily , and be back about tea - time . "
90364	90370	90372	90373	Mrs. Cross	174	" I have no doubt , "
90375	90407	90372	90373	Mrs. Cross	174	" that Martha will be so obliging as to have tea ready for you . If she does n't feel strong enough , of course I will see to it myself . "
90464	90472	90474	90474	Martha	274	" I 'm very sorry , mum , "
90489	90517	90474	90474	Martha	274	" I 'd promised to go and see my brother as has just lost his wife ; but of course , if it is n't convenient , mum "
90518	90550	90447	90448	Mrs. Cross	174	" It really is not , Martha . Miss Bertha will be out all day , and I do n't like being left alone You shall go to - morrow instead . "
90583	90591	90592	90592	she	174	" What 's this smell , Martha ? "
90599	90604	90592	90592	she	174	" what is burning ? "
90605	90622	90624	90625	the servant	660	" Oh , it 's only a dishcloth as was drying and caught fire , mum , "
90627	90635	90637	90638	the mistress	2011	" Only ! What do you mean ? "
90642	90652	90637	90638	the mistress	2011	" Do you wish to burn the house down ? "
90683	90689	90691	90692	Mrs. Cross	174	" What do you mean ? "
90694	90703	90691	90692	Mrs. Cross	174	" Show me the burnt cloth at once . "
90704	90711	90759	90759	Martha	274	" There you are , mum ! "
90776	90785	90787	90788	Mrs. Cross	174	" Of course you will pay for it , "
90794	90826	90787	90788	Mrs. Cross	174	" Go on with your work at once , and do n't let me have any more of this extraordinary behaviour . I ca n't think what has come to you . "
90922	90925	90920	90920	She	174	" Martha , "
90948	90955	90957	90957	herself	174	" Go away ! Go away ! "
90987	90994	91021	91022	the voice	2015	" Go away ! Go away ! "
90995	91005	91007	91008	Mrs. Cross	174	" What 's the matter with you , Martha ? "
91015	91019	91021	91022	the voice	2015	" Go away ! "
91025	91040	91021	91022	the voice	2015	" Either you open the door this moment , or I call a policeman . "
91113	91120	91121	91121	she	174	" You wo n't go away ? "
91123	91134	91121	91121	she	174	" There , then there goes one of your plates ! "
91142	91170	91135	91135	She	174	" You wo n't go away ? There goes one of you dishes ! and there goes a basin ! And there goes a tea - cup ! "
91193	91204	91206	91206	Martha	274	" You think you 'll make me pay for them ? "
91209	91259	91260	91260	She	174	" Not me not me ! It 's you as owes me money money for all the work I 've done as was n't in my wages , and for the food as I have n't had , when I 'd ought to . What do you call that ? "
91272	91353	91260	91260	She	174	" Is that a dinner for a human being , or is it a dinner for a beetle ? D'you think I 'd eat it , and me with money in my pocket to buy better ? You want to make a walkin ' skeleton of me , do you ? but I 'll have it out of you , I will There goes another dish ! And here goes a sugar - basin ! And here goes your teapot ! "
91387	91502	91503	91503	She	2016	" You 'd hit me , would you ? Two can play at that game you old skinflint , you ! Come another step nearer , and I 'll bring this poker on your head ! You thought you 'd get somebody you could do as you liked with , did n't you ? You thought because I was willing , and tried to do my best , as I could be put upon to any extent , did you ? It 's about time you learnt your mistake , you old cheese - parer ! You and me has an account to settle . Let me get at you let me get at you "
91750	91761	91763	91764	Mrs. Cross	174	" Are you going back to the shop at once ? "
91776	91782	91729	91731	a familiar figure	2027	" Straight back , mum . "
91783	91814	91763	91764	Mrs. Cross	174	" Then run as quickly as ever you can , and tell Mr. Jollyman that I wish to see him immediately immediately . Run ! Do n't lose a moment ! "
91901	91907	91908	91908	she	174	" Oh , Mr. Jollyman ! "
91911	91970	91908	91908	she	174	" What I have just gone through ! That girl has gone raving mad she has broken almost everything in the house , and tried to kill me with the poker . Oh , I am so glad you 've come ! Of course there 's never a policeman when they 're wanted . Do please come in . "
91981	91985	91971	91971	Warburton	156	" that girl , "
92027	92037	92024	92025	Mrs. Hopper	158	" But I thought she had been doing very well "
92038	92085	91971	91971	Warburton	156	" So she had , so she had , Mr. Jollyman except for a few little things though there was always something rather strange about her . It 's only today that she broke out . She is mad , I assure you , raving mad ! "
92093	92102	92103	92103	he	156	" Do n't you notice a suspicious odour ? "
92107	92114	92116	92117	Mrs. Cross	174	" You think it 's that ! "
92124	92225	92116	92117	Mrs. Cross	174	" Oh , I daresay you 're right . I 'm too agitated to notice anything . Oh , Mr. Jollyman ! Do , do help me to get the creature out of the house . How shameful that people gave her a good character . But everybody deceives me everybody treats me cruelly , heartlessly . Do n't leave me alone with that creature , Mr. Jollyman . Oh , if you knew what I have been through with servants ! But never anything so bad as this never ! Oh , I feel quite ill I must sit down "
92418	92429	92430	92430	she	174	" How can I ever thank you , Mr. Jollyman ! "
92445	92474	92430	92430	she	174	" Without you , what would have become of me ! Oh , I feel so weak , if I had strength to get myself a cup of tea "
92475	92483	92485	92485	Warburton	156	" Let me get it for you , "
92487	92500	92485	92485	Warburton	156	" Nothing easier . I noticed the kettle by the kitchen fire . "
92501	92521	92430	92430	she	174	" Oh , I can not allow , you , Mr. Jollyman you are too kind I feel so ashamed "
92575	92584	92586	92586	Will	159	" Your daughter is here , Mrs. Cross , "
92600	92603	92604	92604	she	2052	" Bertha , "
92607	92633	92604	92604	she	2052	" Bertha , are you there ? Oh , come and thank Mr. Jollyman ! If you knew what has happened whilst you were away ! "
92652	92664	92666	92667	the mother	615	" It 's a wonder you find me alive , dear , "
92669	92681	92666	92667	the mother	615	" If one of those blows had fallen on my head ! "
92682	92687	92697	92697	he	156	" Let me explain , "
92705	92720	92722	92723	Mrs. Cross	174	" And Mr. Jollyman was just getting me a clip of tea , Bertha , "
92725	92738	92722	92723	Mrs. Cross	174	" I do feel ashamed that he should have had such trouble . "
92739	92748	92750	92750	Bertha	222	" Mr. Jollyman has been very kind indeed , "
92760	92771	92750	92750	Bertha	222	" I 'm sure we can not thank him enough . "
92780	92789	92790	92790	he	156	" I feel rather guilty in the matter , "
92793	92825	92790	92790	he	156	" for it was I who suggested the servant . If you will let me , I will do my best to atone by trying to find another and a better . "
92826	92836	92838	92839	Mrs. Cross	174	" Run and make the tea , my dear , "
92841	92851	92838	92839	Mrs. Cross	174	" Perhaps Mr. Jollyman will have a cup with us "
92912	92924	92926	92927	Mrs. Cross	174	" I shall never dare to live alone with a servant , "
92929	92943	92926	92927	Mrs. Cross	174	" If you leave me , I must go into lodgings , dear . "
92944	92951	92953	92954	the girl	2296	" Hush , hush , mother , "
92961	92969	92957	92957	her	2296	" Of course I shall not leave you .
92970	93248	93255	93255	she	2060	" Oh , the dreadful things I have been through ! It was drink , Bertha ; that creature was a drunkard of the most dangerous kind . She did her best to murder me . I wonder I am not at this moment lying dead . Oh , but the kindness of Mr. Jollyman ! What a good thing I sent for him ! And he speaks of finding us another servant ; but , Bertha , I shall never try to manage a servant again never . I shall always be afraid of them ; I shall dread to give the simplest order . You , my dear , must be the mistress of the house ; indeed you must . I give over everything into your hands . I will never interfere ; I wo n't say a word , whatever fault I may have to find ; not a word . Oh , that creature ; that horrible woman will haunt my dreams . Bertha , you do n't think she 'll hang about the house , and lie in wait for me , to be revenged ? We must tell the policeman to look out for her . I 'm sure I shall never venture to go out alone , and if you leave me in the house with a new servant , even for an hour , I must be in a room with the door locked . My nerves will never recover from this shock . Oh , if you knew how ill I feel ! I 'll have a cup of tea , and then go straight to bed . "
93262	93283	93255	93255	she	2060	" Do you think I ought to have pressed him to stay , dear ? I did n't feel sure . "
93284	93298	93300	93300	Bertha	222	" No , no , you were quite right not to do so , "
93302	93317	93300	93300	Bertha	222	" He of course understood that it was better for us to be alone . "
93318	93336	93255	93255	she	2060	" I thought he would . Really , for a grocer , he is so very gentlemanly . "
93337	93345	93300	93300	Bertha	222	" That 's not surprising , mother . "
93346	93386	93255	93255	she	2060	" No , no ; I 'm always forgetting that he is n't a grocer by birth . I think , Bertha , it will only be right to ask him to come to tea some day before long . "
93398	93401	93402	93402	she	2061	" Certainly , "
93405	93412	93402	93402	she	2061	" if you would like to . "
93413	93443	93300	93300	Bertha	222	" I really should . He was so very kind to me . And perhaps what do you think ? ought we to invite him in his proper name ? "
93444	93451	93453	93453	Bertha	222	" No , I think not , "
93461	93472	93453	93453	Bertha	222	" We are not supposed to know anything about that . "
93473	93622	93300	93300	Bertha	222	" To be sure not . Oh , that dreadful creature . I see her eyes , glaring at me , like a tiger 's . Fifty times at least did she chase me round this table . I thought I should have dropped with exhaustion ; and if I had , one blow of that poker would have finished me . Never speak to me of servants , Bertha . Engage any one you like , but do , do be careful to make inquiries about her . I shall never wish even to know her name ; I shall never look at her face ; I shall never speak a word to her . I leave all the responsibility to you , dear . And now , help me upstairs . I 'm sure ' I could never get up alone . I tremble in every limb "
94887	94892	94876	94876	herself	158	" take too much , "
95003	95041	95000	95000	he	159	" You are aware , I think , that the name under which I do business is not my own . Permit me , in writing to you on a private matter , to use my own signature "
95089	95092	95085	95086	Mrs. Cross	174	" Sarah Walker "
95109	95161	95085	95086	Mrs. Cross	174	" We are very greatly obliged for the trouble you have taken . Many thanks for your kind inquiries as to my health . I am glad to say that the worst of the shock has passed away , though I fear that I shall long continue to feel its effects . "
95176	95200	95085	95086	Mrs. Cross	174	" Should you be disengaged on Sunday next , we shall be glad if you will take a cup of tea with us . "
95500	95504	95518	95518	Her	183	" in company . "
95618	95929	95597	95597	he	159	" I went in and asked whether the old man was dead ; no , he had retired from business and was lodging not far away . I found the house a rather grimy place , and the door was opened by a decidedly grimy woman . I saw at once that she did n't care to let me in . What was my business ? and so on ; but I held firm , and got at last into a room on the second floor , an uncomfortable sitting - room , where poor old Potts welcomed me . If only he had known my address , he said , he should have written to tell me the news . His son in America , the one I knew , was doing well , and sent money every month , enough for him to live upon . ' But was he comfortable in those lodgings ? I asked . Of course I saw that he was n't , and I saw too that my question made him nervous . He looked at the door , and spoke in a whisper . The upshot of it was that he had fallen into the hands of a landlady who victimised him ; just because she was an old acquaintance , he did n't feel able to leave her . ' Shall I help you to get away ? ' I asked him , and his face shone with hope . Of course the woman was listening at the keyhole ; we both knew that . When I went away she had run half down the stairs , and I caught her angry look before she hid it with a grin . I must find decent lodgings for the old fellow , as soon as possible . He is being bled mercilessly . "
95930	95935	95937	95938	Mrs. Cross	174	" How very disgraceful ! "
95940	95952	95937	95938	Mrs. Cross	174	" Really , the meanness of some women of that class ! "
95971	95982	95984	95985	her mother	716	" I wonder whether we could hear of anything suitable , "
95987	96007	95984	95985	her mother	716	" by inquiring of people we know out at Holloway . I 'm thinking of the Boltons , Bertha . "
96078	96081	96082	96082	she	183	" Why , "
96085	96095	96082	96082	she	183	" do you stay in such very uncomfortable rooms ? "
96096	96102	96103	96103	Will	159	" It does n't matter , "
96106	96114	96103	96103	Will	159	" it 's only for a time . "
96115	96123	96103	96103	Will	159	" Ah , you have other views ? "
96124	96127	96128	96128	he	159	" Yes , "
96134	96140	96128	96128	he	159	" I have other views . "
96173	96234	96158	96158	She	174	" We have been making inquiries , and at last I think we have heard of something that might suit your poor friend . This is the address . My daughter went there this morning , and had a long talk with the woman , and she thinks it really might do ; but perhaps you have already found something ? "
96235	96240	96242	96242	Will	159	" Nothing at all , "
96244	96260	96242	96242	Will	159	" I am much obliged to you . I will go as soon as possible . "
96261	96273	96275	96276	Mrs. Cross	174	" We shall be so glad to hear if it suits , "
96278	96309	96310	96310	she	174	" Do look in on Sunday , will you ? We are always at home at five o'clock . Oh , I have written out a little list of things , "
96321	96330	96310	96310	she	174	" Please tell me what they come to . "
96358	96361	96342	96342	her	174	" look in "
96425	96434	96436	96436	Bertha	183	" But will he be allowed to leave ? "
96447	96534	96438	96438	her	183	" He wo n't dare , he tells me , to give notice but he 'll only have to pay a week 's rent in lieu of it . I have promised to be with him at ten to morrow morning , to help him to get away . I shall take my heaviest walking - stick ; one must be prepared for every emergency . Glance over the police news on Tuesday , Mrs. Cross , just to see whether I have come to harm . "
96535	96543	96545	96547	the literal lady	2133	" We shall be very anxious indeed , "
96553	96602	96545	96547	the literal lady	2133	" Could n't you let us hear to - morrow evening ? I know only too well what dreadful creatures the women of that class can be . I very strongly advise you , Mr. Warburton , to be accompanied by a policeman . I beg you will . "
96630	96675	96617	96618	Mrs. Cross	174	" not without uproar . The woman shrieked insults from her doorstep after our departing cab . Poor Mr. Potts was all but paralytic with alarm , but came round famously at sight of the new lodgings . He wants to thank you both . "
96753	96758	96759	96759	he	245	" Read that , Warburton "
96765	96779	96759	96759	he	245	" Read that , and tell me what you think of human nature . "
96918	96926	96928	96928	Godfrey	177	" He encloses a very liberal cheque , "
96930	96977	96928	96928	Godfrey	177	" But what a downfall ! I foresaw it . I hinted my fears to you as soon as Miss Parker appeared on the scene . Poor old Milligan ! A lost man sunk in the commonplace hopelessly whelmed in vulgar matrimony . Poor old fellow ! "
96981	96988	96978	96978	Warburton	156	" But that is n't all , "
96994	97028	96978	96978	Warburton	156	" Old Strangwyn is dead , really dead at last . I wrote several times to him ; no acknowledgment of my letters . Now it 's all over . The ten thousand pounds "
97037	97247	97029	97029	He	2140	" Take that cheque , Warburton . It 's all I have ; take it , old fellow , and try to forgive me . You wo n't ? Well , well , if I live , I 'll pay you yet ; but I 'm a good deal run down , and these disappointments have almost floored me . To tell you the truth , the vegetarian diet wo n't do . I feel as weak as a cat . If you knew the heroism it has cost me , down at the seaside , to refrain from chops and steaks . Now I give it up . Another month of cabbage and lentils and I should be sunk beyond recovery . I give it up . This very night I shall go and have a supper , a real supper , in town . Will you come with me , old man ? What 's before me , I do n't know . I have half a mind to go to Canada as farm labourer ; it would be just the thing for my health ; but let us go and have one more supper together , as in the old days . Where shall it be ? "
97486	97495	97497	97498	Mrs. Cross	174	" What do you think we did yesterday ? "
97500	97573	97497	97498	Mrs. Cross	174	" We took the liberty of calling upon Mr. Potts . We had to go and see Mrs. Bolton , at Holloway , and , as it was so near , we thought we might venture using your name as our introduction . And the poor old gentleman was delighted to see us was n't he , Bertha ? Oh , and he is so grateful for our suggestion of the lodgings . "
97590	97627	97585	97585	Warburton	156	" It was kind of you . The old man feels a little lonely in that foreign region ; he 's hardly been out of Kennington for forty years . A very kind thought , indeed . "
97628	97633	97635	97635	Bertha	183	" I am relieved , "
97637	97661	97635	97635	Bertha	183	" it seemed to me just possible that we had been guilty of a serious indiscretion . Good intentions are very dangerous things . "
97818	97824	97834	97834	she	183	" what do you call her "
97882	97896	97859	97860	Mrs. Cross	174	" In my time he could always be depended upon for a small shoulder "
98021	98062	97992	97993	her mother	716	" I wish you would tell that girl to make my bed properly . I have n't closed my eyes for three nights , and I ache from head to foot . The way she neglects my room is really shameful "
98074	98085	98086	98086	she	183	" That shall be seen to at once , mother , "
98227	98238	98191	98191	she	174	" Is this how you keep your promise , mother ? "
98239	98264	98191	98191	she	174	" Promise ? Did I promise to look on at wicked waste ? Do you want to bring us to the workhouse , child ? "
98265	98282	98284	98284	Bertha	183	" Do n't let us waste time in talking about what we settled a month ago , "
98287	98325	98284	98284	Bertha	183	" Sarah is doing very well , and there must be no change . I am quite content to pay her wages myself . Keep your promise , mother , and let us live quietly and decently . "
98326	98342	98191	98191	she	174	" If you call it living decently to pamper a servant until she bursts with insolence "
98343	98418	98284	98284	Bertha	183	" When was Sarah insolent to you ? She has never been disrespectful to me . Quite the contrary , I think her a very good servant indeed . You know that I have a good deal of work to do just now , and to speak quite plainly I ca n't let you upset the orderly life of the house . Be quiet , there 's a dear . I insist upon it . "
98576	98581	98546	98546	she	174	" behaved very badly . "
98722	98741	98709	98709	she	174	" Of course , you are invited , too , but I 'm afraid you are too busy ? "
98773	98784	98758	98758	she	183	" But I do n't like to leave you alone here "
98931	98935	98928	98928	Sarah	278	" Mr. Warburton . "
98969	98977	98978	98978	she	183	" No bad news , I hope ? "
98990	98994	99003	99003	Her	183	" Bad news ? "
98995	99002	99003	99003	Her	183	" I thought you looked rather troubled "
99012	99025	99026	99026	he	159	" Do I ? I did n't know it but , yes , "
99031	99043	99026	99026	he	159	" you are right . Something has vexed me a trifle . "
99044	99063	99026	99026	he	159	" Look at these drawings of Miss Medwin 's . They will make you forget all vexatious trifles . "
99210	99216	99217	99217	she	183	" A very clever girl , "
99227	99233	99235	99235	Will	159	" Very , no doubt , "
99242	99249	99235	99235	Will	159	" Wo n't you sit down ? "
99250	99313	99337	99337	her	183	" Gladly , if you do n't think I am staying too long . I had something I wanted to talk about . That was why I felt glum when I came in and found a stranger here . It 's such a long time since I had any part in ordinary society , that I 'm forgetting how to behave myself . "
99314	99330	99332	99332	Bertha	183	" I must apologise for you to Miss Medwin , when I see her next , "
99340	99354	99356	99356	Will	159	" She will understand if you tell her I 'm only a grocer , "
99366	99372	99337	99337	her	183	" That might complicate things . "
99373	99378	99380	99380	Warburton	156	" Do you know , "
99382	99425	99380	99380	Warburton	156	" I feel sure that the Franks will never again invite me to lunch or dine there . Franks is very careful when he asks me to go and see them ; he always adds that they 'll be alone quite alone . "
99426	99433	99337	99337	her	183	" But that 's a privilege . "
99434	99459	99380	99380	Warburton	156	" So it may be taken ; but would it surprise you if they really preferred to see as little of me as possible ? "
99477	99484	99460	99460	Bertha	183	" I think I should understand . "
99485	99492	99494	99494	Will	159	" So do I , quite , "
99498	99588	99494	99494	Will	159	" I wanted to tell you that I 've been looking about me , trying to find some way of getting out of the shop . It is n't so easy . I might get a clerkship at a couple of pounds a week , but that does n't strike me as preferable to my present position . I 've been corresponding with Applegarth , the jam manufacturer , and he very strongly advises me to stick to trade . I 'm not sure that he is n't right . "
99599	99604	99605	99605	Warburton	156	" Do you know , "
99609	99615	99605	99605	Warburton	156	" why I turned grocer ? "
99616	99619	99460	99460	Bertha	183	" Yes . "
99620	99666	99605	99605	Warburton	156	" It was a fortunate idea . I do n't see how else I should have made enough money , these three years , to pay the income I owed to my mother and sister , and to support myself . Since my mother 's death "
99672	99786	99667	99667	Her	2202	" I am forgetting that you could not have known of that . She died last autumn ; by my father 's will , our old house , at St. Neots then became mine ; it 's let ; the rent goes to my sister , and out of the shop profits I easily make up what her own part of the lost capital used to yield . Jane is going in for horticulture , making a business of what was always her chief pleasure , and before long she may be independent ; but it would be shabby to get rid of my responsibilities at her expense do n't you think so ? "
99787	99792	99460	99460	Bertha	183	" Worse than shabby . "
99793	99810	99667	99667	Her	2202	" Good . I like to hear you speak so decidedly . Now , if you please "
99818	99853	99811	99811	his	2203	" tell me in the same tone whether you agree with Applegarth whether you think I should do better to stick to the shop and not worry with looking for a more respectable employment . "
99865	99876	99460	99460	Bertha	183	" It depends entirely on how you feel about it . "
99877	99881	99883	99883	Warburton	156	" Not entirely , "
99890	100128	99883	99883	Warburton	156	" but first let me tell you how I do feel about it . You know I began shopkeeping as if I were ashamed of myself . I kept it a dead secret ; hid away from everybody ; told elaborate lies to my people ; and the result was what might have been expected before long I sank into a vile hypochrondria , saw everything black or dirty grey , thought life intolerable . When common sense found out what was the matter with me , I resolved to have done with snobbery and lying ; but a sanguine friend of mine , the only one in my confidence , made me believe that something was going to happen in fact , the recovery of the lost thousands ; and I foolishly held on for a time . Since the awful truth has been divulged , I have felt a different man . I ca n't say that I glory in grocerdom ? but the plain fact is that I see nothing degrading in it , and I do my day 's work as a matter of course . Is it any worse to stand behind a counter than to sit in a counting - house ? Why should retail trade be vulgar , and wholesale quite repeatable ? This is what I 've come to , as far as my own thought and feeling go . "
100129	100132	100134	100134	Bertha	183	" Then , "
100142	100149	100134	100134	Bertha	183	" why trouble yourself any more ? "
100150	100152	99883	99883	Warburton	156	" Because "
100197	100214	100190	100190	he	2204	" One may be content to be a grocer ; but what about one 's wife ? "
100230	100238	100227	100227	Bertha	183	" Ah , that 's a question . "
100308	100314	100315	100315	he	2204	" It 's a question , "
100318	100348	100315	100315	he	2204	" which has troubled me for a long time . Do you remember when was it ? A year ago ? going one Sunday with Mrs. Cross to Kew ? "
100349	100356	100455	100455	his	2207	" I remember it very well . "
100357	100367	100368	100368	Will	159	" I happened to be at Kew that day , "
100374	100443	100368	100368	Will	159	" You passed me as I stood on the bridge . I saw you go into the Gardens , and I said to myself how pleasant it would be if I could have ventured to join you in your walk . You knew me as your grocer . For me to have approached and spoken , would have been an outrage . That day I had villainous thoughts . "
100463	100473	100474	100474	she	183	" We thought your name was really Jolly man , "
100484	100505	100444	100444	Bertha	183	" Of course you did . A good invention , by the bye , that name , was n't it ? "
100506	100511	100512	100512	she	183	" Very good indeed , "
100517	100527	100529	100529	Will	159	" And you used to come to the shop . "
100531	100551	100444	100444	Bertha	183	" And I looked forward to it . There was something human in your way of talking to me . "
100552	100557	100444	100444	Bertha	183	" I hope so . "
100558	100632	100444	100444	Bertha	183	" Yes , but it made me ask myself that question . I comforted myself by saying that of course the shop was only a temporary expedient ; I should get out of it ; I should find another way of making money ; but , you see , I 'm as far from that as ever ; and if I decide to go on shopkeeping do n't I condemn myself to solitude ? "
100633	100639	100641	100641	Bertha	183	" It is a difficulty , "
100655	100683	100684	100684	He	159	" Now and then , some time ago , I half persuaded myself that , even though a difficulty , it need n't be a fatal one . "
100696	100711	100684	100684	He	159	" but that was when you still came to the shop . Suddenly you ceased "
100724	100727	100720	100720	Bertha	183	" Yes . "
100728	100736	100737	100737	His	159	" I have been wondering what that meant "
100765	100772	100762	100762	she	183	" No explanation occurred to you ? "
100794	100797	100798	100798	he	159	" Several , "
100806	100852	100798	100798	he	159	" The one which most plagued me , I should very likely do better to keep to myself ; but I wo n't ; you shall know it . Perhaps you are prepared for it . Do you know that I went abroad last summer ? "
100853	100859	100762	100762	she	183	" I heard of it . "
100860	100865	100798	100798	he	159	" From Miss Elvan ? "
100866	100871	100762	100762	she	183	" From Mrs. Franks . "
100872	100903	100798	100798	he	159	" Mrs. Franks yes . She told you , then , that I had been to St. Jean de Luz ? She told you that I had seen her sister ? "
100904	100907	100909	100909	Bertha	183	" Yes , "
100915	100927	100909	100909	Bertha	183	" You had long wished to see that part of France . "
100928	101083	101084	101084	He	2208	" That was n't my reason for going . I went in a fit of lunacy . I went because I thought Miss Elvan was there . They told me at her Chelsea lodgings that she had gone to St. Jean de Luz . This was on the day after she came into the shop with you . I had been seeing her . We met here and there , when she was sketching . I went crazy . Do n't for a moment think the fault was hers do n't dream of anything of the kind . I , I alone , ass , idiot , was to blame . She must have seen what had happened , and , in leaving her lodgings , she purposely gave a false address , never imagining that I was capable of pursuing her across Europe . At St. Jean de Luz I heard of her marriage "
101104	101113	101084	101084	He	2208	" Did you suspect anything of all that ? "
101121	101129	101084	101084	He	2208	" If so , of course I understand "
101151	101158	101159	101159	Will	159	" Are you saying to yourself , "
101164	101285	101159	101159	Will	159	" that , instead of being merely a foolish man , I have shown myself to be shameless ? It was foolish , no doubt , to dream that an educated girl might marry a grocer ; but when he begins his suit by telling such a story as this ! Perhaps I need n't have told it at all . Perhaps you had never had a suspicion of such things ? All the same , it 's better so . I 've had enough of lies to last me for all my life ; but now that I 've told you , try to believe something else ; and that is that I never loved Rosamund Elvan never never ! "
101316	101322	101323	101323	Will	159	" Can you believe that ? "
101339	101348	101326	101326	his	159	" I should have to think about it , "
101357	101436	101326	101326	his	159	" The fit of madness from which I suffered is very common in men . Often it has serious results . No end of marriages come about in that way . Happily I was in no danger of that . I simply made a most colossal fool of myself . And all the time all the time , I tell you , believe it or not , as you will or can I was in love with you . "
101449	101666	101441	101441	her	183	" I went one day from St. Jean de Luz over the border into Spain , and came to a village among the mountains , called Vera . And there my madness left me . And I thought of you thought of you all the way back to St. Jean de Luz , thought of you as I had been accustomed to do in England , as if nothing had happened . Do you think it pained me then that Rosamund was Mrs. Franks ? No more than if I had never seen her ; by that time , fresh air and exercise were doing their work , and at Vera I stood a sane man once more . I find it hard to believe now that I really behaved in that frantic way . Do you remember coming once to the shop to ask for a box to send to America ? As you talked to me that morning , I knew what I know better still now , that there was no girl that I liked as I liked you , no girl whose face had so much meaning for me , whose voice and way of speaking so satisfied me . But you do n't understand I ca n't express it it sounds stupid "
101667	101673	101675	101675	Bertha	183	" I understand very well , "
101684	101693	101441	101441	her	183	" But the other thing , my insanity ? "
101694	101703	101704	101704	she	183	" I should have to think about that , "
101726	101735	101714	101714	Will	159	" Did you suspect anything of the sort ? "
101761	101816	101821	101821	he	2209	" Will you let me see you again soon ? May I come some afternoon in this week , and take my chance of finding you at home ? Do n't answer . I shall come , and you have only to refuse me at the door . It 's only an importunate tradesman . "
101910	101917	101918	101918	He	2209	" She 's dead , sir . "
101942	101946	101948	101948	Will	159	" Poor girl , "
101951	101960	101948	101948	Will	159	" It 's the end of much suffering . "
101961	101970	101972	101972	Allchin	161	" That 's what I say , sir , "
101974	101994	101972	101972	Allchin	161	" And poor Mrs. Hopper , she 's fair worn out with nursing her . Nobody can feel sorry . "
102051	102055	102056	102056	he	285	" Forgive me , "
102059	102066	102056	102056	he	285	" for coming again so soon . "
102067	102082	102084	102084	Bertha	183	" Tell me what you think of this idea of a book - cover , "
102128	102137	102139	102139	Will	159	" You are really fond of this work ? "
102141	102151	102139	102139	Will	159	" You would be sorry to give it up ? "
102152	102160	102161	102161	Bertha	183	" Think of the world 's loss , "
102183	102196	102197	102197	Will	159	" There were things I ought to have told you on Sunday . "
102203	102459	102197	102197	Will	159	" Things I forgot . That 's why I have come again so soon . I ought to have told you much more about myself . How can you know my character my peculiarities faults ? I 've been going over all that . I do n't think I 'm ill - tempered , or unjust or violent , but there are things that irritate me . Unpunctuality for instance . Dinner ten minutes late makes me fume ; failure to keep an appointment makes me hate a person , I 'm rather a grumbler about food ; ca n't stand a potato ill - boiled or an under - done chop . Then ah yes ! restraint is intolerable to me . I must come and go at my own will . I must do and refrain just as I think fit . One enormous advantage of my shopkeeping is that I 'm my own master . I ca n't subordinate myself , wo n't be ruled . Fault - finding would exasperate me ; dictation would madden me . Then yes , the money matter . I 'm not extravagant , but I hate parsimony . If it pleases me to give away a sovereign I must be free to do it . Then yes , I 'm not very tidy in my habits ; I have no respect for furniture ; I like , when it 's comfortable , to sit with my boots on the fender ; and I loathe antimacassars . "
102493	102502	102503	102503	she	183	" You ca n't think of anything else ? "
102516	102524	102525	102525	He	159	" Those are my most serious points . "
102528	102550	102525	102525	He	159	" I only came to tell you of them , that you might add them to the objection of the shop . "
102563	102568	102555	102555	He	159	" You will think ? "
102587	102592	102594	102594	she	183	" not to look . "
102608	102613	102594	102594	she	183	" I have thought . "
102614	102617	102594	102594	she	183	" And ? "
102618	102702	102594	102594	she	183	" There is only one thing I am sorry for that you are nothing worse than a grocer . A grocer 's is such a clean , dainty , aromatic trade . Now if you kept an oil shop there would be some credit in overlooking it . And you are so little even of a grocer , that I should constantly forget it . I should think of you simply as a very honest man the most honest man I ever knew . "
102708	102712	102713	102713	he	285	" Should should ? "
102716	102723	102713	102713	he	285	" Ca n't it be shall ? "
102966	102984	102948	102948	she	174	" Ah , Bertha , if one could get such servants here ! But London ruins them . "
103012	103035	103036	103036	James	283	" Oh , and the air , Bertha . I had n't been there a day before I felt a different creature . "
103168	103176	103178	103178	Bertha	183	" Perhaps uncle thinks of marrying again ? "
103180	103190	103192	103193	her mother	716	" Not a bit of it , my dear , "
103196	103267	103192	103193	her mother	716	" He expressly told me that he should never do that . I should n't wonder if but let bygones be bygones . No , he spoke of something quite different . Last night we were talking , when the children had gone to bed , and all at once he startled me by saying ' If only you could come and keep house for me . ' The idea ! "
103268	103278	103280	103280	Bertha	183	" A wonderfully good idea it seems to me , "
103284	103297	103192	103193	her mother	716	" But how is it possible , Bertha ? Are you serious ? "
103298	103334	103192	103193	her mother	716	" Quite . I think it might be the very best thing for you . You need something to do , mother . If Uncle James really wishes it , you ought certainly to accept . "
103392	103403	103405	103406	the listener	746	" Oh , do n't trouble about me , mother , "
103408	103413	103405	103406	the listener	746	" Nothing is simpler . "
103414	103421	103461	103462	Mrs. Cross	174	" But what would you do ? "
103422	103435	103436	103436	Bertha	183	" Oh , there are all sorts of possibilities . At the worst "
103447	103453	103436	103436	Bertha	183	" I could get married . "
103490	103499	103500	103500	she	174	" Then Mr. Warburton has found a position ? "
103505	103514	103536	103537	Mrs. Cross	174	" No , he keeps to the shop . "
103515	103527	103536	103537	Mrs. Cross	174	" But my dear you do n't mean to tell me ? "
103546	103549	103551	103551	Bertha	183	" Yes , "
103557	103601	103551	103551	Bertha	183	" we have decided that there 's no choice . The business is a very good one ; it improves from day to day ; now that there are two assistants , Mr. Warburton need not work so hard as he used to . "
103602	103625	103536	103537	Mrs. Cross	174	" But , my dearest Bertha , you mean to say that you are going to be the wife of a grocer ? "
103626	103650	103551	103551	Bertha	183	" Yes , mother , I really have made up my mind to it . After all , is it so very disgraceful ? "
103651	103660	103536	103537	Mrs. Cross	174	" What will your friends say ? What will "
103661	103665	103667	103667	Bertha	183	" Mrs. Grundy ? "
103669	103677	103536	103537	Mrs. Cross	174	" I was going to say Mrs. Franks "
103685	103698	103678	103678	Bertha	183	" That 's very much the same thing , I 'm afraid . "
103780	103785	103786	103786	she	167	" Will that do ? "
103824	103841	103843	103843	Franks	267	" Better than the old canvas I put my foot through , do n't you think ? "
103845	103861	103812	103812	her	167	" Of course there 's no comparison . You 've developed wonderfully . In those days "
103920	103922	103953	103954	the artist	329	" interpretation "
103942	103951	103953	103954	the artist	329	" Old Warburton must come and see it , "
104012	104023	104024	104024	Franks	160	" I really ought to go and look him up . "
104027	104118	104024	104024	Franks	160	" I keep on saying I 'll go to - morrow and to - morrow . Any one else would think me an ungrateful snob ; but old Warburton is too good a fellow . To tell the truth , I feel a little ashamed when I think of how he 's living . He ought to have a percentage on my income . What would have become of me if he had n't put his hand into his pocket when he was well off and I was a beggar ? "
104119	104131	104133	104133	Rosamund	167	" But do n't you think his business must be profitable ? "
104144	104159	104160	104160	Franks	160	" The old chap is n't much of a business man , I fancy , "
104166	104209	104160	104160	Franks	160	" And he has his mother and sister to support . And no doubt he 's always giving away money . His lodgings are miserable . It makes me uncomfortable to go there . Suppose we ask him to lunch on Sunday ? "
104216	104229	104210	104210	Rosamund	167	" If you like I had thought of asking the Fitzjames girls . "
104230	104244	104160	104160	Franks	160	" You do n't think we might have him at the same time ? "
104259	104296	104256	104256	she	167	" Would he care for it ? And he said did n't he ? that he meant to tell everybody , everywhere , how he earned his living . Would n't it be just a little ? "
104301	104341	104297	104297	Franks	160	" Yes , it might be just a little . Well , he must come and see the picture quietly . And I 'll go and look up the poor old fellow to - night , I really will . "
104387	104405	104297	104297	Franks	160	" All about her husband 's pictures , so tiresome ? She thinks them monuments of genius ! "
104406	104415	104417	104417	Franks	160	" His last thing is n't half bad , "
104423	104455	104417	104417	Franks	160	" Perhaps not . Of course I pretended to think him the greatest painter of modern times . Nothing else will satisfy the silly little woman . You found Mr. Warburton ? "
104462	104469	104471	104471	her	167	" I have news for you . "
104480	104492	104471	104471	her	167	" He 's going to be married . Guess to whom . "
104493	104497	104471	104471	her	167	" Not to ? "

104541	104633	104471	104471	her	167	" Position ? His position behind the counter , that 's all . Say 's he sha n't budge . By the bye , his mother died last autumn ; he 's in easier circumstances ; the shop does well , it seems . He thought of trying for something else , but talked it over with Bertha Cross , and they decided to stick to groceries . They 'll live in the house at Walham Green . Mrs. Cross is going away to keep house for a brother of hers . "

104704	104729	104697	104697	Franks	160	" there 's a good deal to be said for sticking to a business which yields a decent income , and promises much more . "
104730	104733	104735	104735	Rosamund	167	" Money ! "
104738	104743	104735	104735	Rosamund	167	" What is money ? "
104744	104750	104753	104754	the other	404	" We find it useful , "
104756	104798	104735	104735	Rosamund	167	" Certainly we do ; but you are an artist , Norbert , and money is only an accident of your career . Do we ever talk about it , or think about it ? Poor Bertha ! With her talent ! "

104884	104907	104835	104836	his wife	569	" Why , yes . It came very unexpectedly . I had no idea they saw each other except in the shop . "
104908	104914	104916	104916	Rosamund	167	" And it vexes you ? "
104924	104935	104936	104936	He	160	" Vexes ? Oh , I ca n't say that . "
104944	104967	104936	104936	He	160	" Why should it vex me ? After all , Warburton is such a thoroughly good fellow , and if he makes money "
