950	952	958	964	The sister , who was not pretty	430	" good "
1376	1400	1365	1365	himself	445	" I say , Biddy , why should we sit moping here all day ? Come and take a turn about with me . "
1434	1447	1449	1452	the other Miss Dormer	136	" Where shall we find you , then , if Peter comes ? "
1460	1478	1449	1452	the other Miss Dormer	136	" I daresay Peter wo n't come . He 'll leave us here to cool our heels . "
1479	1484	1485	1485	Biddy	134	" Oh Nick dear ! "
1523	1543	1544	1544	Nick	224	" We shall come back in a quarter of an hour . Really I must look at these things , "
1602	1626	1588	1589	Lady Agnes	132	" Everything seems very dreadful . I should think Biddy had better sit still . Has n't she seen enough horrors up above ? "
1627	1639	1640	1642	the elder girl	453	" I daresay that if Peter comes Julia'll be with him , "
1646	1661	1663	1664	Lady Agnes	132	" Well then he can take Julia about . That will be more proper , "
1666	1691	1692	1692	Nick	224	" Mother dear , she does n't care a rap about art . It 's a fearful bore looking at fine things with Julia , "
1695	1705	1692	1692	Nick	224	" Wo n't you go with him , Grace ? "
1714	1723	1724	1724	Grace	140	" I think she has awfully good taste ! "
1732	1741	1742	1743	Lady Agnes	132	" Do n't say nasty things about her ! "
1765	1776	1777	1779	the young man	445	" I say nothing but what she 'd say herself , "
1782	1805	1777	1779	the young man	445	" About some things she has very good taste , but about this kind of thing she has no taste at all . "
1806	1814	1816	1817	Lady Agnes	132	" That 's better , I think , "
1825	1829	1777	1779	the young man	445	" kind of thing "
1836	1844	1845	1845	Grace	140	" She 's awfully clever - awfully ! "
1851	1856	1857	1858	her brother	458	" Awfully , awfully ! "
1872	1884	1886	1888	the young lady	459	" You are nasty , Nick . You know you are , "
1919	1935	1936	1936	she	134	" Might n't you go and order lunch - in that place , you know ? "
1942	1953	1936	1936	she	134	" Then we 'd come back when it was ready . "
1954	1965	1966	1967	Lady Agnes	132	" My dear child , I ca n't order lunch , "
1992	2013	1978	1978	she	132	" Then perhaps Peter will if he comes . I 'm sure he 's up in everything of that sort . "
2014	2019	2020	2020	Nick	224	" Oh hang Peter ! "
2023	2044	2020	2020	Nick	224	" Leave him out of account , and do order lunch , mother ; but not cold beef and pickles . "
2045	2058	2059	2059	Biddy	134	" I must say - about him - you 're not nice , "
2074	2084	2085	2087	the young man	445	" You make up for it , my dear , "
2110	2122	2123	2124	her ladyship	464	" I ca n't imagine what you 've got against him , "
2128	2137	2138	2138	Nick	224	" Dear mother , it 's disappointed fondness , "
2141	2181	2138	2138	Nick	224	" They wo n't answer one 's notes ; they wo n't let one know where they are nor what to expect . ' Hell has no fury like a woman scorned ' ; nor like a man either . "
2182	2209	2210	2210	Biddy	134	" Peter has such a tremendous lot to do - it 's a very busy time at the embassy ; there are sure to be reasons , "
2217	2224	2226	2227	Lady Agnes	132	" Reasons enough , no doubt ! "
2254	2271	2272	2272	Grace	140	" Does n't Julia write to you , does n't she answer you the very day ? "
2297	2313	2314	2314	he	224	" What do you know about my correspondence ? No doubt I ask too much , "
2318	2334	2314	2314	he	224	" I 'm so attached to them . Dear old Peter , dear old Julia ! "
2335	2345	2347	2349	the elder girl	453	" She 's younger than you , my dear ! "
2354	2360	2383	2384	Lady Agnes	132	" Yes , nineteen days . "
2361	2370	2314	2314	he	224	" I 'm glad you know her birthday . "
2371	2382	2383	2384	Lady Agnes	132	" She knows yours ; she always gives you something , "
2389	2402	2403	2404	Grace Dormer	140	" Her taste is good then , is n't it , Nick ? "
2407	2430	2314	2314	he	224	" She makes charming presents ; but , dear mother , it is n't her taste . It 's her husband 's . "
2431	2437	2314	2314	he	224	" How her husband 's ? "
2438	2462	2314	2314	he	224	" The beautiful objects of which she disposes so freely are the things he collected for years laboriously , devotedly , poor man ! "
2463	2476	2478	2479	Lady Agnes	132	" She disposes of them to you , but not to others , "
2481	2488	2489	2489	she	132	" But that 's all right , "
2510	2527	2489	2489	she	132	" She has to select among so many , and that 's a proof of taste , "
2532	2544	2545	2545	Grace	140	" You ca n't say she does n't choose lovely ones , "
2557	2582	2583	2584	Nicholas Dormer	224	" My dear , they 're all lovely . George Dallow 's judgement was so sure , he was incapable of making a mistake , "
2587	2603	2605	2606	Lady Agnes	132	" I do n't see how you can talk of him , he was dreadful , "
2608	2631	2545	2545	Grace	140	" My dear , if he was good enough for Julia to marry he 's good enough for us to talk of . "
2632	2641	2681	2682	Lady Agnes	132	" She did him a very great honour . "
2642	2670	2545	2545	Grace	140	" I daresay , but he was not unworthy of it . No such enlightened collection of beautiful objects has been made in England in our time . "
2671	2680	2681	2682	Lady Agnes	132	" You think too much of beautiful objects ! "
2685	2699	2681	2682	Lady Agnes	132	" I thought you were just now lamenting that I think too little . "
2700	2714	2715	2715	Biddy	134	" It 's very nice - his having left Julia so well off , "
2726	2736	2737	2737	Nick	224	" He treated her en grand seigneur , absolutely , "
2741	2751	2737	2737	Nick	224	" He used to look greasy , all the same "
2762	2771	2753	2753	Grace	140	" His name ought to have been Tallow . "
2772	2792	2793	2794	her brother	458	" You 're not saying what Julia would like , if that 's what you are trying to say , "
2797	2805	2807	2808	Lady Agnes	132	" Do n't be vulgar , Grace , "
2810	2818	2819	2819	Biddy	134	" I know Peter Sherringham 's birthday ! "
2885	2897	2898	2898	Grace	140	" He 's too much older than you , my dear , "
2903	2933	2934	2934	Biddy	134	" That 's why I 've noticed it - he 's thirty - four . Do you call that too old ? I do n't care for slobbering infants ! "
2937	2943	2944	2945	Lady Agnes	132	" Do n't be vulgar , "
2949	2973	2974	2975	her brother	458	" Come , Bid , we 'll go and be vulgar together ; for that 's what we are , I 'm afraid , "
2980	2994	2974	2975	her brother	458	" We 'll go and look at all these low works of art . "
2995	3009	3010	3011	Lady Agnes	132	" Do you really think it 's necessary to the child 's development ? "
3044	3078	3037	3037	his	452	" What we 've been through this morning in this place , and what you 've paraded before our eyes - the murders , the tortures , all kinds of disease and indecency ! "
3133	3145	3146	3146	he	224	" Ah dear mother , do n't do the British matron ! "
3152	3169	3146	3146	he	224	" British matron 's soon said ! I do n't know what they 're coming to . "
3170	3211	3258	3258	her	140	" How odd that you should have been struck only with the disagreeable things when , for myself , I 've felt it to be most interesting , the most suggestive morning I 've passed for ever so many months ! "
3212	3218	3146	3146	he	224	" Oh Nick , Nick ! "
3229	3243	3245	3246	Grace Dormer	140	" I like them better in London - they 're much less unpleasant , "
3248	3257	3258	3259	her ladyship	464	" They 're things you can look at , "
3263	3271	3258	3259	her ladyship	464	" We certainly make the better show . "
3272	3287	3288	3288	Biddy	134	" The subject does n't matter , it 's the treatment , the treatment ! "
3301	3306	3308	3309	her brother	458	" Poor little Bid ! "
3315	3341	3342	3343	the girl	481	" How can I learn to model , mamma dear , if I do n't look at things and if I do n't study them ? "
3378	3562	3563	3565	the young man	445	" This place is an immense stimulus to me ; it refreshes me , excites me - it 's such an exhibition of artistic life . It 's full of ideas , full of refinements ; it gives one such an impression of artistic experience . They try everything , they feel everything . While you were looking at the murders , apparently , I observed an immense deal of curious and interesting work . There are too many of them , poor devils ; so many who must make their way , who must attract attention . Some of them can only taper fort , stand on their heads , turn somersaults or commit deeds of violence , to make people notice them . After that , no doubt , a good many will be quieter . But I do n't know ; to - day I 'm in an appreciative mood - I feel indulgent even to them : they give me an impression of intelligence , of eager observation . All art is one - remember that , Biddy dear , "
3574	3623	3563	3565	the young man	445	" It 's the same great many - headed effort , and any ground that 's gained by an individual , any spark that 's struck in any province , is of use and of suggestion to all the others . We 're all in the same boat . "
3624	3645	3646	3647	Lady Agnes	132	" ' We , ' do you say , my dear ? Are you really setting up for an artist ? "
3654	3661	3650	3650	Nick	224	" I was speaking for Biddy . "
3662	3673	3674	3675	the girl	481	" But you are one , Nick - you are ! "
3693	3699	3686	3686	she	132	" Do n't be vulgar ! "
3765	3774	3775	3775	Biddy	134	" We 're all in the same boat , "
3781	3789	3790	3791	Lady Agnes	132	" Not me , if you please ! "
3794	3804	3790	3791	Lady Agnes	132	" It 's horrid messy work , your modelling . "
3805	3813	3815	3816	the girl	481	" Ah but look at the results ! "
3855	3869	3870	3871	Nicholas Dormer	224	" There 's a great deal being done here - a real vitality , "
3884	3893	3870	3871	Nicholas Dormer	224	" Some of these fellows go very far . "
3894	3899	3901	3902	Lady Agnes	132	" They do indeed ! "
3904	3918	3919	3919	Nick	224	" I 'm fond of young schools - like this movement in sculpture , "
3927	3936	3870	3871	Nicholas Dormer	224	" They 're old enough to know better ! "
3937	3952	3953	3953	Biddy	134	" May n't I look , mamma ? It is necessary to my development , "
3956	3964	3966	3967	Lady Agnes	132	" You may do as you like , "
3971	3982	3983	3985	the young man	445	" She ought to see good work , you know , "
3989	3999	3983	3985	the young man	445	" I leave it to your sense of responsibility . "
4062	4074	4056	4056	Grace	140	" Please , mamma , are we never going to lunch ? "
4075	4081	4082	4084	the young man	445	" Ah mother , mother ! "
4149	4160	4161	4161	she	132	" You used to have so much sense of responsibility , "
4164	4184	4161	4161	she	132	" but sometimes I do n't know what has become of it - it seems all , all gone ! "
4185	4191	4192	4192	he	224	" Ah mother , mother ! "
4460	4478	4479	4480	his sister	491	" I ought to get plenty of ideas for my modelling , ought n't I , Nick ? "
4488	4499	4479	4480	his sister	491	" Ah my poor child , what shall I say ? "
4500	4512	4513	4514	the girl	481	" Do n't you think I 've any capacity for ideas ? "
4518	4546	4513	4514	the girl	481	" Lots of them , no doubt . But the capacity for applying them , for putting them into practice - how much of that have you ? "
4547	4556	4513	4514	the girl	481	" How can I tell till I try ? "
4557	4568	4513	4514	the girl	481	" What do you mean by trying , Biddy dear ? "
4569	4579	4513	4514	the girl	481	" Why you know - you 've seen me . "
4580	4587	4513	4514	the girl	481	" Do you call that trying ? "
4593	4597	4598	4598	she	481	" Ah Nick ! "
4609	4618	4598	4598	she	481	" And please what do you call it ? "
4619	4630	4632	4633	her companion	505	" Well , this for instance is a good case . "
4704	4715	4696	4696	Biddy	134	" Ah that 's not trying ; that 's succeeding . "
4716	4726	4860	4860	she	134	" Not altogether ; it 's only trying seriously . "
4727	4737	4696	4696	Biddy	134	" Well , why should n't I be serious ? "
4738	4844	4860	4860	she	134	" Mother would n't like it . She has inherited the fine old superstition that art 's pardonable only so long as it 's bad - so long as it 's done at odd hours , for a little distraction , like a game of tennis or of whist . The only thing that can justify it , the effort to carry it as far as one can which you ca n't do without time and singleness of purpose , she regards as just the dangerous , the criminal element . It 's the oddest hind - part - before view , the drollest immorality . "
4845	4855	4860	4860	she	134	" She does n't want one to be professional , "
4868	4881	4860	4860	she	134	" Better leave it alone then . There are always duffers enough . "
4882	4892	4893	4893	Biddy	134	" I do n't want to be a duffer , "
4896	4904	4893	4893	Biddy	134	" But I thought you encouraged me . "
4905	4921	4860	4860	she	134	" So I did , my poor child . It was only to encourage myself . "
4922	4931	4893	4893	Biddy	134	" With your own work - your painting ? "
4932	4962	4860	4860	she	134	" With my futile , my ill - starred endeavours . Union is strength - so that we might present a wider front , a larger surface of resistance . "
5082	5089	5090	5090	She	134	" And often not even then . "
5135	5154	5129	5129	her	134	" I do n't so much care whether or no I please mamma , if I please you . "
5155	5176	5177	5177	he	458	" Oh do n't lean on me . I 'm a wretched broken reed - I 'm no use really ! "
5182	5191	5192	5192	Biddy	134	" Do you mean you 're a duffer ? "
5197	5202	5177	5177	he	458	" Frightful , frightful ! "
5203	5224	5177	5177	he	458	" So that you intend to give up your work - to let it alone , as you advise me ? "
5225	5253	5177	5177	he	458	" It has never been my work , all that business , Biddy . If it had it would be different . I should stick to it . "
5254	5263	5264	5265	the girl	481	" And you wo n't stick to it ? "
5300	5317	5292	5292	she	481	" Your questions are much simpler than the elements out of which my answer should come . "
5318	5329	5285	5285	she	481	" A great talent - what 's simpler than that ? "
5330	5343	5292	5292	she	481	" One excellent thing , dear Biddy : no talent at all ! "
5344	5357	5285	5285	she	481	" Well , yours is so real you ca n't help it . "
5358	5367	5369	5370	Nick Dormer	224	" We shall see , we shall see , "
5372	5382	5369	5370	Nick Dormer	224	" Let us go look at that big group . "
5383	5393	5394	5394	Biddy	134	" We shall see if your talent 's real ? "
5402	5427	5428	5430	the young man	445	" No ; we shall see if , as you say , I ca n't help it . What nonsense Paris makes one talk ! "
5483	5487	5489	5489	he	445	" putting in , "
5831	5834	5843	5843	he	445	" crisis , "
6753	6766	6767	6767	Nick	224	" I never come across you - I do n't know why , "
6789	6808	6823	6823	his	579	" Oh it seems to me there 's reason enough : our paths in life are so different . "
6832	6861	6823	6823	his	579	" Different , yes , but not so different as that . Do n't we both live in London , after all , and in the nineteenth century ? "
6862	6885	6886	6887	the gentleman	554	" Ah my dear Dormer , excuse me : I do n't live in the nineteenth century . Jamais de la vie ! "
6890	6896	6823	6823	his	579	" Nor in London either ? "
6897	6929	6934	6934	he	581	" Yes - when I 'm not at Samarcand ! But surely we 've diverged since the old days . I adore what you burn , you burn what I adore . "
7003	7012	7013	7014	Nicholas Dormer	224	" How do you know what I adore ? "
7017	7027	7013	7014	Nicholas Dormer	224	" I know well enough what you used to . "
7028	7043	7013	7014	Nicholas Dormer	224	" That 's more than I do myself . There were so many things . "
7044	7064	7013	7014	Nicholas Dormer	224	" Yes , there are many things - many , many : that 's what makes life so amusing . "
7065	7072	7013	7014	Nicholas Dormer	224	" Do you find it amusing ? "
7073	7110	7013	7014	Nicholas Dormer	224	" My dear fellow , c'est a se tordre . Do n't you think so ? Ah it was high time I should meet you - I see . I 've an idea you need me . "
7111	7120	7121	7121	Nick	224	" Upon my word I think I do ! "
7153	7166	7167	7169	the mysterious personage	586	" There are many gods and this is one of their temples , "
7173	7195	7167	7169	the mysterious personage	586	" It 's a house of strange idols - is n't it ? - and of some strange and unnatural sacrifices . "
7567	7581	7561	7561	Nick	224	" You 're not in London - one ca n't meet you there ? "
7582	7590	7633	7633	his	445	" I rove , drift , float , "
7595	7627	7628	7630	the young man	445	" my feelings direct me - if such a life as mine may be said to have a direction . Where there 's anything to feel I try to be there ! "
7637	7647	7648	7648	Nick	224	" I should like to get hold of you , "
7651	7682	7633	7633	his	445	" Well , in that case there would be no doubt the intellectual adventure . Those are the currents - any sort of personal relation - that govern my career . "
7683	7694	7695	7695	Nick	224	" I do n't want to lose you this time , "
7736	7747	7749	7750	the stranger	581	" Do n't lose me , do n't lose me ! "
7769	7783	7786	7786	he	224	" After all why should you ? Let us remain together unless I interfere "
7844	7851	7852	7852	he	224	" Certainly , I keep you , "
7855	7866	7852	7852	he	224	" unless on my side I deprive those ladies - ! "
7867	7905	7907	7910	this Nick 's friend	616	" Charming women , but it 's not an indissoluble union . We meet , we communicate , we part ! They 're going - I 'm seeing them to the door . I shall come back . "
7943	7952	7953	7953	Biddy	134	" Who is he - who are they ? "
7957	7963	7964	7964	Nick	224	" He 's a gentleman , "
8053	8068	8050	8050	he	224	" See here , my dear , do you think you had better stay ? "
8069	8080	8081	8082	the girl	481	" Do you want me to go back to mother ? "
8089	8097	8098	8098	He	224	" Well , what do you think ? "
8105	8117	8050	8050	he	224	" Is your conversation to be about - about private affairs ? "
8118	8148	8050	8050	he	224	" No , I ca n't say that . But I doubt if mother would think it the sort of thing that 's ' necessary to your development . ' "
8165	8175	8160	8160	she	481	" But who are they - who are they ? "
8176	8253	8050	8050	he	224	" I know nothing of the ladies . I never saw them before . The man 's a fellow I knew very well at Oxford . He was thought immense fun there . We 've diverged , as he says , and I had almost lost sight of him , but not so much as he thinks , because I 've read him - read him with interest . He has written a very clever book . "
8254	8261	8160	8160	she	481	" What kind of a book ? "
8262	8268	8050	8050	he	224	" A sort of novel . "
8269	8275	8160	8160	she	481	" What sort of novel ? "
8276	8291	8050	8050	he	224	" Well , I do n't know - with a lot of good writing . "
8308	8321	8299	8299	she	134	" I daresay Peter will have come if you return to mother . "
8322	8346	8347	8347	Nick	224	" I do n't care if he has . Peter 's nothing to me . But I 'll go if you wish it . "
8356	8367	8347	8347	Nick	224	" It does n't signify . We 'll all go . "
8368	8371	8372	8372	she	134	" All ? "
8375	8391	8347	8347	Nick	224	" He wo n't hurt us . On the contrary he 'll do us good . "
8524	8529	8516	8516	Nick	224	" My sister Bridget , "
8536	8541	8516	8516	Nick	224	" Mr. Gabriel Nash . "
8542	8552	8553	8554	Mr. Nash	147	" You enjoy Paris - you 're happy here ? "
8596	8605	8586	8586	her	481	" Oh yes , it 's very nice . "
8606	8620	8632	8633	Mr. Nash	147	" And French art interests you ? You find things here that please ? "
8621	8631	8586	8586	her	481	" Oh yes , I like some of them . "
8638	8650	8632	8633	Mr. Nash	147	" I hoped you 'd say you like the Academy better . "
8651	8663	8665	8666	Nicholas Dormer	224	" She would if she did n't think you expected it , "
8668	8672	8673	8673	Biddy	134	" Oh Nick ! "
8676	8685	8686	8687	their visitor	636	" Miss Dormer 's herself an English picture , "
8702	8714	8715	8715	Biddy	134	" That 's a compliment if you do n't like them ! "
8718	8736	8737	8738	Mr. Nash	147	" Ah some of them , some of them ; there 's a certain sort of thing ! "
8741	8758	8737	8738	Mr. Nash	147	" We must feel everything , everything that we can . We 're here for that . "
8759	8767	8768	8768	Nick	224	" You do like English art then ? "
8783	8825	8777	8778	Mr. Nash	147	" My dear Dormer , do you remember the old complaint I used to make of you ? You had formulas that were like walking in one 's hat . One may see something in a case and one may not . "
8826	8831	8833	8833	Nick	224	" Upon my word , "
8835	8868	8833	8833	Nick	224	" I do n't know any one who was fonder of a generalisation than you . You turned them off as the man at the street - corner distributes hand - bills . "
8869	8882	8777	8778	Mr. Nash	147	" They were my wild oats . I 've sown them all . "
8883	8889	8833	8833	Nick	224	" We shall see that ! "
8890	8915	8777	8778	Mr. Nash	147	" Oh there 's nothing of them now : a tame , scanty , homely growth . My only good generalisations are my actions . "
8916	8923	8833	8833	Nick	224	" We shall see them then . "
8924	9004	8777	8778	Mr. Nash	147	" Ah pardon me . You ca n't see them with the naked eye . Moreover , mine are principally negative . People 's actions , I know , are for the most part the things they do - but mine are all the things I do n't do . There are so many of those , so many , but they do n't produce any effect . And then all the rest are shades - extremely fine shades . "
9005	9010	9011	9011	Nick	224	" Shades of behaviour ? "
9037	9045	9047	9049	the young man	445	" Shades of impression , of appreciation , "
9055	9064	9051	9051	his	445	" All my behaviour consists of my feelings . "
9065	9079	9021	9022	Mr. Nash	147	" Well , do n't you show your feelings ? You used to ! "
9080	9089	9090	9090	Nash	147	" Was n't it mainly those of disgust ? "
9093	9105	9090	9090	Nash	147	" Those operate no longer . I 've closed that window . "
9106	9114	9021	9022	Mr. Nash	147	" Do you mean you like everything ? "
9115	9131	9090	9090	Nash	147	" Dear me , no ! But I look only at what I do like . "
9132	9146	9021	9022	Mr. Nash	147	" Do you mean that you 've lost the noble faculty of disgust ? "
9147	9164	9166	9167	Gabriel Nash	147	" I have n't the least idea . I never try it . My dear fellow , "
9169	9199	9166	9167	Gabriel Nash	147	" we 've only one life that we know anything about : fancy taking it up with disagreeable impressions ! When then shall we go in for the agreeable ? "
9200	9209	9210	9210	Nick	224	" What do you mean by the agreeable ? "
9213	9240	9210	9210	Nick	224	" Oh the happy moments of our consciousness - the multiplication of those moments . We must save as many as possible from the dark gulf . "
9279	9297	9270	9270	her	134	" Do n't you think there are any wrongs in the world - any abuses and sufferings ? "
9298	9313	9270	9270	her	134	" Oh so many , so many ! That 's why one must choose . "
9314	9330	9331	9331	Biddy	134	" Choose to stop them , to reform them - is n't that the choice ? "
9334	9340	9341	9341	she	134	" That 's Nick 's , "
9351	9358	9359	9360	Mr. Nash	147	" Ah our divergence - yes ! "
9363	9388	9359	9360	Mr. Nash	147	" There are all kinds of machinery for that - very complicated and ingenious . Your formulas , my dear Dormer , your formulas ! "
9389	9399	9400	9400	Nick	224	" Hang 'em , I have n't got any ! "
9405	9418	9419	9420	Mr. Nash	147	" To me personally the simplest ways are those that appeal most , "
9424	9455	9419	9420	Mr. Nash	147	" We pay too much attention to the ugly ; we notice it , we magnify it . The great thing is to leave it alone and encourage the beautiful . "
9456	9469	9471	9471	Nick	224	" You must be very sure you get hold of the beautiful , "
9473	9511	9419	9420	Mr. Nash	147	" Ah precisely , and that 's just the importance of the faculty of appreciation . We must train our special sense . It 's capable of extraordinary extension . Life 's none too long for that . "
9512	9548	9549	9549	Dormer	224	" But what 's the good of the extraordinary extension if there is no affirmation of it , if it all goes to the negative , as you say ? Where are the fine consequences ? "
9552	9586	9588	9589	Gabriel Nash	147	" In one 's own spirit . One is one 's self a fine consequence . That 's the most important one we have to do with . I am a fine consequence , "
9648	9655	9626	9626	her	134	" Are you then an asthete ? "
9656	9742	9626	9626	her	134	" Ah there 's one of the formulas ! That 's walking in one 's hat ! I 've no profession , my dear young lady . I 've no Ă tat civil . These things are a part of the complicated ingenious machinery . As I say , I keep to the simplest way . I find that gives one enough to do . Merely to be is such a mĂ tier ; to live such an art ; to feel such a career ! "
9762	9767	9743	9744	Bridget Dormer	134	" And to write ? "
9768	9780	9743	9744	Bridget Dormer	134	" To write ? Oh I shall never do it again ! "
9781	9808	9743	9744	Bridget Dormer	134	" You 've done it almost well enough to be inconsistent . That book of yours is anything but negative ; it 's complicated and ingenious . "
9809	9822	9824	9825	Gabriel Nash	147	" My dear fellow , I 'm extremely ashamed of that book , "
9827	9840	9841	9842	his companion	647	" Ah call yourself a bloated Buddhist and have done with it ! "
9845	9921	9743	9744	Bridget Dormer	134	" Have done with it ? I have n't the least desire to have done with it . And why should one call one 's self anything ? One only deprives other people of their dearest occupation . Let me add that you do n't begin to have an insight into the art of life till it ceases to be of the smallest consequence to you what you may be called . That 's rudimentary . "
9922	9942	9943	9943	Nick	224	" But if you go in for shades you must also go in for names . You must distinguish , "
9946	9960	9943	9943	Nick	224	" The observer 's nothing without his categories , his types and varieties . "
9961	9968	9970	9971	Gabriel Nash	147	" Ah trust him to distinguish ! "
9974	10066	9970	9971	Gabriel Nash	147	" That 's for his own convenience ; he has , privately , a terminology to meet it . That 's one 's style . But from the moment it 's for the convenience of others the signs have to be grosser , the shades begin to go . That 's a deplorable hour ! Literature , you see , is for the convenience of others . It requires the most abject concessions . It plays such mischief with one 's style that really I 've had to give it up . "
10067	10071	10072	10072	Nick	224	" And politics ? "
10075	10082	10084	10085	Mr. Nash	147	" Well , what about them ? "
10146	10173	10130	10130	Nick	224	" That , no doubt you 'll say , is still far more for the convenience of others - is still worse for one 's style . "
10185	10207	10181	10182	Mr. Nash	147	" It has simply nothing in life to do with shades ! I ca n't say worse for it than that . "
10221	10236	10208	10208	Biddy	134	" Wo n't mamma be waiting ? Ought n't we to go to luncheon ? "
10251	10263	10246	10247	Mr. Nash	147	" You ought to protest ! You ought to save him ! "
10264	10269	10270	10270	Biddy	134	" To save him ? "
10273	10298	10246	10247	Mr. Nash	147	" He had a style , upon my word he had ! But I 've seen it go . I 've read his speeches . "
10299	10306	10307	10307	Nick	224	" You were capable of that ? "
10310	10329	10246	10247	Mr. Nash	147	" For you , yes . But it was like listening to a nightingale in a brass band . "
10330	10337	10338	10338	Biddy	134	" I think they were beautiful , "
10363	10395	10358	10358	his	147	" But , Miss Dormer , he had eyes . He was made to see - to see all over , to see everything . There are so few like that . "
10396	10403	10404	10404	Biddy	134	" I think he still sees , "
10417	10476	10358	10358	his	147	" He sees his ' side , ' his dreadful ' side , ' dear young lady . Poor man , fancy your having a ' side ' - you , you - and spending your days and your nights looking at it ! I 'd as soon pass my life looking at an advertisement on a hoarding . "
10477	10489	10491	10491	Nick	224	" You do n't see me some day a great statesman ? "
10493	10508	10358	10358	his	147	" My dear fellow , it 's exactly what I 've a terror of . "
10509	10518	10519	10519	Biddy	134	" Mercy ! do n't you admire them ? "
10522	10551	10358	10358	his	147	" It 's a trade like another and a method of making one 's way which society certainly condones . But when one can be something better - ! "
10552	10561	10562	10562	Biddy	134	" Why what in the world is better ? "
10578	10600	10601	10601	he	224	" Gabriel Nash is better ! You must come and lunch with us . I must keep you - I must ! "
10604	10611	10612	10613	Mr. Nash	147	" We shall save him yet , "
10664	10675	10661	10661	she	132	" I suppose one must have food at any rate , "
10690	10705	10706	10706	she	132	" And where are we to go ? I hate eating out of doors , "
10710	10721	10722	10722	Grace	140	" Dear me , when one comes to Paris - ! "
10756	10758	10722	10722	Grace	140	" Buffet "
10796	10801	10785	10788	One of these functionaries	661	" Mesdames sont seules ? "
10812	10819	10820	10820	He	661	" Non ; nous sommes beaucoup ! "
10921	10931	10932	10932	she	140	" Not cold beef and pickles , you know , "
10961	10974	10975	10975	Grace	140	" What does it signify ? I daresay it 's all nasty , "
10983	10994	10979	10979	she	140	" If Peter comes he 's sure to be particular . "
10995	11004	11005	11006	her ladyship	464	" Let him first be particular to come ! "
11017	11026	11027	11028	the man	5488	" Poulet chasseur , filets mignons sauce bearnaise , "
11031	11041	11043	11044	Lady Agnes	132	" You 'll give us what I tell you , "
11210	11216	11217	11217	she	132	" Everything 's absurdly dear , "
11308	11321	11303	11304	Lady Agnes	132	" He makes me unhappy , the way he talks about Julia . "
11322	11339	11340	11340	Grace	140	" Sometimes I think he does it to torment one . One ca n't mention her ! "
11343	11358	11303	11304	Lady Agnes	132	" It 's better not to mention her , but to leave it alone . "
11359	11368	11303	11304	Lady Agnes	132	" Yet he never mentions her of himself . "
11369	11394	11303	11304	Lady Agnes	132	" In some cases that 's supposed to show that people like people - though of course something more 's required to prove it , "
11401	11424	11395	11396	Lady Agnes	132	" Sometimes I think he 's thinking of her , then at others I ca n't fancy what he 's thinking of . "
11425	11432	11434	11434	Grace	140	" It would be awfully suitable , "
11470	11484	11459	11459	she	140	" Of course he must like her - he has known her always . "
11485	11496	11497	11497	Grace	140	" Nothing can be plainer than that she likes him , "
11500	11504	11505	11506	Lady Agnes	132	" Poor Julia ! "
11527	11541	11542	11543	her daughter	499	" It is n't as if she was n't clever and well read , "
11547	11572	11542	11543	her daughter	499	" If there were nothing else there would be a reason in her being so interested in politics , in everything that he is . "
11573	11586	11542	11543	her daughter	499	" Ah what Nick is - that 's what I sometimes wonder ! "
11595	11609	11587	11587	Grace	140	" Why , mother , is n't he going to be like papa ? "
11625	11636	11622	11622	she	140	" I thought you thought him so like him already . "
11637	11644	11646	11647	Lady Agnes	132	" Well , I do n't , "
11650	11660	11661	11662	Lady Agnes	132	" Who is then ? Certainly Percy is n't . "
11668	11677	11661	11662	Lady Agnes	132	" There 's no one like your father . "
11678	11682	11683	11683	Grace	140	" Dear papa ! "
11693	11712	11683	11683	Grace	140	" It would be so jolly for all of us - she 'd be so nice to us . "
11713	11723	11725	11726	Lady Agnes	132	" She 's that already - in her way , "
11739	11747	11749	11749	she	140	" Much good does it do her ! "
11761	11785	11786	11786	Grace	140	" It does her some good that one should look out for her . I do , and I think she knows it , "
11789	11800	11786	11786	Grace	140	" One can at any rate keep other women off . "
11801	11811	11813	11814	her mother	460	" Do n't meddle - you 're very clumsy , "
11821	11840	11813	11814	her mother	460	" There are other women who are beautiful , and there are others who are clever and rich . "
11841	11877	11786	11786	Grace	140	" Yes , but not all in one : that 's what 's so nice in Julia . Her fortune would be thrown in ; he would n't appear to have married her for it . "
11878	11886	11888	11889	Lady Agnes	132	" If he does he wo n't , "
11894	11915	11786	11786	Grace	140	" Yes , that 's what 's so charming . And he could do anything then , could n't he ? "
11916	11928	11786	11786	Grace	140	" Well , your father had no fortune to speak of . "
11929	11940	11786	11786	Grace	140	" Yes , but did n't Uncle Percy help him ? "
11941	11947	11949	11950	Lady Agnes	132	" His wife helped him , "
11952	11956	11958	11959	the girl	481	" Dear mamma ! "
11963	11969	11970	11970	she	132	" There 's one thing , "
11973	11982	11970	11970	she	132	" that Mr. Carteret will always help Nick . "
11983	11993	11786	11786	Grace	140	" What do you mean by ' always ' ? "
11994	12003	11970	11970	she	132	" Why whether he marries Julia or not . "
12004	12011	12012	12013	Lady Agnes	132	" Things are n't so easy , "
12016	12034	12012	12013	Lady Agnes	132	" It will all depend on Nick 's behaviour . He can stop it to - morrow . "
12054	12061	12039	12039	she	140	" How could he stop it ? "
12062	12080	12039	12039	she	140	" By not being serious . It is n't so hard to prevent people giving you money . "
12081	12084	12085	12085	Grace	140	" Serious ? "
12088	12101	12085	12085	Grace	140	" Does he want him to be a prig like Lord Egbert ? "
12102	12130	12039	12039	she	140	" Yes - that 's exactly what he wants . And what he 'll do for him he 'll do for him only if he marries Julia . "
12131	12137	12138	12138	Grace	140	" Has he told you ? "
12150	12157	12158	12158	she	460	" I 'm delighted at that ! "
12161	12176	12177	12178	Lady Agnes	132	" He has n't told me , but that 's the way things happen . "
12207	12232	12190	12190	she	132	" If Nick becomes rich Charles Carteret will make him more so . If he does n't he wo n't give him a shilling . "
12233	12237	12238	12238	Grace	140	" Oh mamma ! "
12241	12264	12265	12266	her ladyship	464	" It 's all very well to say that in public life money is n't as necessary as it used to be , "
12271	12289	12265	12266	her ladyship	464	" Those who say so do n't know anything about it . It 's always intensely necessary . "
12314	12336	12290	12291	Her daughter	499	" I daresay ; but there 's the fact - is n't there ? - that poor papa had so little . "
12337	12350	12390	12390	she	140	" Yes , and there 's the fact that it killed him ! "
12379	12383	12368	12369	Grace Dormer	140	" Oh mother ! "
12397	12401	12390	12390	she	140	" Oh Peter ! "
12418	12433	12410	12411	a gentleman	548	" How d'ye do , Cousin Agnes ? How d'ye do , little Grace ? "
12616	12759	12611	12611	she	132	" I expected him , I wanted him to go ; and indeed , not hearing from you , he would have gone immediately - an hour or two hence , on leaving this place . But we 're here so quietly - not to go out , not to seem to appeal to the ambassador . Nick put it so - ' Oh mother , we 'll keep out of it ; a friendly note will do . ' I do n't know definitely what he wanted to keep out of , unless anything like gaiety . The embassy is n't gay , I know . But I 'm sure his note was friendly , was n't it ? I daresay you 'll see for yourself . He 's different directly he gets abroad ; he does n't seem to care . "
12777	12812	12774	12774	she	132	" He said you 'd have seen Julia and that you 'd understand everything from her . And when I asked how she 'd know he said , ' Oh she knows everything ! ' "
12813	12824	12825	12826	Peter Sherringham	144	" He never said a word to me about Julia , "
13053	13068	13069	13070	Lady Agnes	132	" Three days with Mrs. Billinghurst - how very good - natured of her ! "
13073	13082	13083	13083	Sherringham	144	" Oh they 're very nice to her , "
13086	13093	13094	13095	Grace Dormer	140	" Well , I hope so ! "
13098	13108	13094	13095	Grace Dormer	140	" Why did n't you make her come here ? "
13109	13119	13164	13165	Lady Agnes	132	" I proposed it , but she would n't . "
13138	13154	13134	13134	Peter	144	" She said you must come and see her at the HĂ tel de Hollande . "
13155	13163	13164	13165	Lady Agnes	132	" Of course we 'll do that , "
13168	13179	13164	13165	Lady Agnes	132	" Nick went to ask about her at the Westminster . "
13180	13200	13213	13213	she	140	" She gave that up ; they would n't give her the rooms she wanted , her usual set . "
13201	13207	13208	13208	Grace	140	" She 's delightfully particular ! "
13216	13226	13213	13213	she	140	" She does like pictures , does n't she ? "
13231	13261	13227	13228	Peter Sherringham	144	" Oh I daresay . But that 's not what she has in her head this morning . She has some news from London - she 's immensely excited . "
13262	13270	13271	13272	Lady Agnes	132	" What has she in her head ? "
13275	13283	13284	13284	Grace	140	" What 's her news from London ? "
13287	13294	13213	13213	she	140	" She wants Nick to stand . "
13295	13300	13301	13302	both ladies	724	" Nick to stand ? "
13305	13367	13227	13228	Peter Sherringham	144	" She undertakes to bring him in for Harsh . Mr. Pinks is dead - the fellow , you know , who got the seat at the general election . He dropped down in London - disease of the heart or something of that sort . Julia has her telegram , but I see it was in last night 's papers . "
13368	13376	13378	13379	Lady Agnes	132	" Imagine - Nick never mentioned it ! "
13381	13397	13227	13228	Peter Sherringham	144	" Do n't you know , mother ? - abroad he only reads foreign papers . "
13398	13410	13411	13412	her ladyship	464	" Oh I know . I 've no patience with him , "
13415	13419	13411	13412	her ladyship	464	" Dear Julia ! "
13420	13488	13227	13228	Peter Sherringham	144	" It 's a nasty little place , and Pinks had a tight squeeze - 107 or something of that sort ; but if it returned a Liberal a year ago very likely it will do so again . Julia at any rate believes it can be made to - if the man 's Nick - and is ready to take the order to put him in . "
13489	13501	13502	13502	Grace	140	" I 'm sure if she can do it she will , "
13505	13519	13521	13525	the mother of this candidate	726	" Dear , dear Julia ! And Nick can do something for himself , "
13527	13537	13538	13539	Peter Sherringham	144	" I 've no doubt he can do anything , "
13547	13554	13555	13555	he	144	" Do you mean in expenses ? "
13558	13587	13521	13525	the mother of this candidate	726	" Ah I 'm afraid he ca n't do much in expenses , poor dear boy ! And it 's dreadful how little we can look to Percy . "
13588	13606	13521	13525	the mother of this candidate	726	" Well , I daresay you may look to Julia . I think that 's her idea . "
13607	13611	13521	13525	the mother of this candidate	726	" Delightful Julia ! "
13617	13634	13635	13635	she	132	" If poor Sir Nicholas could have known ! Of course he must go straight home , "
13638	13645	13647	13647	Grace	140	" He wo n't like that , "
13649	13660	13521	13525	the mother of this candidate	726	" Then he 'll have to go without liking it . "
13661	13677	13678	13678	Peter	144	" It will rather spoil your little excursion , if you 've only just come , "
13681	13697	13678	13678	Peter	144	" to say nothing of the great Biddy 's , if she 's enjoying Paris . "
13698	13710	13712	13713	Lady Agnes	132	" We may stay perhaps - with Julia to protect us , "
13715	13730	13521	13525	the mother of this candidate	726	" Ah she wo n't stay ; she 'll go over for her man . "
13731	13737	13771	13771	he	144	" Her man - - ? "
13738	13754	13521	13525	the mother of this candidate	726	" The fellow who stands , whoever he is - especially if he 's Nick . "
13775	13784	13771	13771	he	144	" She 'll go straight down to Harsh . "
13785	13789	13790	13791	Lady Agnes	132	" Wonderful Julia ! "
13794	13804	13790	13791	Lady Agnes	132	" Of course Nick must go straight there too . "
13805	13820	13771	13771	he	144	" Well , I suppose he must see first if they 'll have him . "
13821	13837	13790	13791	Lady Agnes	132	" If they 'll have him ? Why how can he tell till he tries ? "
13838	13852	13771	13771	he	144	" I mean the people at headquarters , the fellows who arrange it . "
13859	13884	13853	13854	Lady Agnes	132	" My dear Peter , do you suppose there will be the least doubt of their ' having ' the son of his father ? "
13885	13902	13790	13791	Lady Agnes	132	" Of course it 's a great name , Cousin Agnes - a very great name . "
13903	13911	13853	13854	Lady Agnes	132	" One of the greatest , simply , "
13916	13926	13928	13928	Grace	140	" It 's the best name in the world ! "
13932	13945	13790	13791	Lady Agnes	132	" All the same it did n't prevent his losing his seat . "
13946	13960	13790	13791	Lady Agnes	132	" By half - a - dozen votes : it was too odious ! "
13965	13990	13790	13791	Lady Agnes	132	" I remember - I remember . And in such a case as that why did n't they immediately put him in somewhere else ? "
13991	14045	13790	13791	Lady Agnes	132	" How one sees you live abroad , dear Peter ! There happens to have been the most extraordinary lack of openings - I never saw anything like it - for a year . They 've had their hand on him , keeping him all ready . I daresay they 've telegraphed him . "
14046	14054	13790	13791	Lady Agnes	132	" And he has n't told you ? "
14059	14070	14055	14056	Lady Agnes	132	" He 's so very odd when he 's abroad ! "
14071	14080	14081	14081	Grace	140	" At home too he lets things go , "
14084	14094	14081	14081	Grace	140	" He does so little - takes no trouble . "
14109	14122	14105	14105	she	460	" I suppose it 's because he knows he 's so clever . "
14123	14149	14081	14081	Grace	140	" So he is , dear old man . But what does he do , what has he been doing , in a positive way ? "
14150	14156	14105	14105	she	460	" He has been painting . "
14157	14162	14081	14081	Grace	140	" Ah not seriously ! "
14167	14174	14176	14177	Peter Sherringham	144	" That 's the worst way , "
14179	14183	14176	14177	Peter Sherringham	144	" Good things ? "
14200	14213	14196	14197	Lady Agnes	132	" He has spoken repeatedly . They 're always calling on him . "
14214	14219	14220	14220	Grace	140	" He speaks magnificently , "
14223	14250	14196	14197	Lady Agnes	132	" That 's another of the things I lose , living in far countries . And he 's doing the Salon now with the great Biddy ? "
14251	14269	14270	14271	Lady Agnes	132	" Just the things in this part . I ca n't think what keeps them so long , "
14274	14284	14270	14271	Lady Agnes	132	" Did you ever see such a dreadful place ? "
14288	14302	14285	14285	Sherringham	144	" Are n't the things good ? I had an idea - - ! "
14303	14306	14308	14309	Lady Agnes	132	" Good ? "
14311	14320	14308	14309	Lady Agnes	132	" They 're too odious , too wicked . "
14321	14324	14326	14326	Peter	144	" Ah , "
14328	14348	14326	14326	Peter	144	" that 's what people fall into if they live abroad . The French ought n't to live abroad ! "
14349	14354	14355	14355	Grace	140	" Here they come , "
14361	14372	14355	14355	Grace	140	" but they 've got a strange man with them . "
14373	14384	14385	14386	Lady Agnes	132	" That 's a bore when we want to talk ! "
14406	14421	14422	14422	he	144	" There will be no difficulty in talking , to judge by the gentleman , "
14746	14749	14757	14757	his	144	" dear fellows "
14751	14755	14757	14757	his	144	" old boys , "
14770	14780	14757	14757	his	144	" Delighted to see you , my dear Bid ! "
14857	14862	14844	14844	Nick	224	" a delightful old friend "
14896	14905	14871	14871	Sherringham	144	" I 've seen you very often before . "
14906	14932	14933	14934	Mr. Nash	147	" Ah repetition - recurrence : we have n't yet , in the study of how to live , abolished that clumsiness , have we ? "
14938	15011	14933	14934	Mr. Nash	147	" It 's a poverty in the supernumeraries of our stage that we do n't pass once for all , but come round and cross again like a procession or an army at the theatre . It 's a sordid economy that ought to have been managed better . The right thing would be just one appearance , and the procession , regardless of expense , for ever and for ever different . "
15056	15080	15045	15047	the young man	445	" Alas , it 's a very shabby idea , is n't it ? The world is n't got up regardless of expense ! "
15093	15101	15081	15081	Grace	140	" Nick , Mr. Pinks is dead . "
15102	15106	15108	15109	Gabriel Nash	147	" Mr. Pinks ? "
15119	15132	15133	15134	the girl	481	" The member for Harsh ; and Julia wants you to stand , "
15138	15153	15154	15154	Gabriel	147	" Mr. Pinks , the member for Harsh ? What names to be sure ! "
15161	15173	15174	15174	Nick	224	" Julia wants me ? I 'm much obliged to her ! "
15178	15194	15174	15174	Nick	224	" Nash , please sit by my mother , with Peter on her other side . "
15195	15203	15205	15206	Lady Agnes	132	" My dear , it is n't Julia "
15210	15233	15205	15206	Lady Agnes	132	" Every one wants you . Have n't you heard from your people ? Did n't you know the seat was vacant ? "
15247	15264	15234	15234	Nick	224	" Upon my word I do n't remember . What else have you ordered , mother ? "
15265	15291	15174	15174	Nick	224	" There 's some boeuf braisĂ , my dear , and afterwards some galantine . Here 's a dish of eggs with asparagus - tips . "
15292	15304	15306	15307	Peter Sherringham	144	" I advise you to go in for it , Nick , "
15318	15356	15174	15174	Nick	224	" Into the eggs with asparagus - tips ? Donnez m'en s'il vous plaĂ t . My dear fellow , how can I stand ? how can I sit ? Where 's the money to come from ? "
15357	15367	15368	15368	Grace	140	" The money ? Why from Jul - - ! "
15379	15389	15390	15390	Nick	224	" Poor Julia , how you do work her ! "
15393	15417	15390	15390	Nick	224	" Nash , I recommend you the asparagus - tips . Mother , he 's my best friend - do look after him . "
15418	15432	15433	15433	Nash	147	" I 've an impression I 've breakfasted - I 'm not sure , "
15436	15450	15433	15433	Nash	147	" With those beautiful ladies ? Try again - you 'll find out . "
15451	15469	15470	15471	Lady Agnes	132	" The money can be managed ; the expenses are very small and the seat 's certain , "
15486	15494	15495	15497	her elder daughter	658	" Rather - if Julia goes down ! "
15500	15508	15509	15509	Nick	224	" Perhaps Julia wo n't go down ! "
15530	15537	15523	15523	she	134	" Who are the beautiful ladies ? "
15582	15590	15591	15592	Mr. Nash	147	" Deluded , misguided , infatuated persons ! "
15604	15622	15597	15597	she	134	" Strange eccentric , almost romantic , types . Predestined victims , simple - minded sacrificial lambs ! "
15639	15644	15634	15634	Biddy	134	" Oh all that ? "
15653	15668	15647	15648	Peter Sherringham	144	" Julia 's here , you know . You must go and see her . "
15683	15687	15669	15669	Nick	224	" You too ? "
15696	15703	15689	15689	Peter	144	" No , no , not I "
15711	15735	15707	15708	his cousin	766	" Of course I 'll go and see her . I 'll go immediately . Please to thank her for thinking of me . "
15736	15749	15750	15751	Lady Agnes	132	" Thinking of you ? There are plenty to think of you ! "
15754	15774	15750	15751	Lady Agnes	132	" There are sure to be telegrams at home . We must go back - we must go back ! "
15775	15783	15784	15785	Nick Dormer	224	" We must go back to England ? "
15798	15808	15795	15795	he	224	" Do you mean I must go to Harsh ? "
15853	15869	15835	15836	this gentleman	769	" Ah what a place to represent ! How can you - how can you ? "
15870	15877	15879	15880	Lady Agnes	132	" It 's an excellent place , "
15883	15911	15879	15880	Lady Agnes	132	" I imagine you 've never been there . It 's a very good place indeed . It belongs very largely to my cousin , Mrs. Dallow . "
15922	15934	15912	15912	Gabriel	147	" But I thought we had no more pocket - boroughs . "
15935	15954	15955	15956	Nick Dormer	224	" It 's pockets we rather lack , so many of us . There are plenty of Harshes , "
15959	15968	15969	15970	Lady Agnes	132	" I do n't know what you mean , "
15985	16001	15978	15979	Peter Sherringham	144	" Oh it 's all right ; they come down on you like a shot ! "
16009	16036	16003	16005	the young man	445	" Do you mean to say you 've to pay money to get into that awful place - that it 's not you who are paid ? "
16037	16043	16044	16045	Lady Agnes	132	" Into that awful place ? "
16049	16065	15978	15979	Peter Sherringham	144	" Into the House of Commons . That you do n't get a high salary ? "
16066	16085	16086	16086	Nick	224	" My dear Nash , you 're delightful : do n't leave me - do n't leave me ! "
16101	16111	16090	16091	his mother	441	" Who in the world 's this extraordinary person ? "
16112	16123	16124	16125	Peter Sherringham	144	" What then did you think pocket - boroughs were ? "
16137	16160	16128	16129	Mr. Nash	147	" Why , boroughs that filled your pocket . To do that sort of thing without a bribe - c'est trop fort ! "
16161	16167	16168	16169	Nick Dormer	224	" He lives at Samarcand , "
16179	16193	16194	16194	he	224	" What do you advise me ? I 'll do whatever you say , "
16202	16211	16212	16213	Lady Agnes	132	" My dear , my dear - - ! "
16216	16234	16236	16237	Peter Sherringham	144	" See Julia first , with all respect to Mr. Nash . She 's of excellent counsel , "
16249	16272	16239	16240	Mr. Nash	147	" The lady first - the lady first ! I 've not a word to suggest as against any idea of hers . "
16273	16290	16292	16293	Lady Agnes	132	" We must n't sit here too long , there 'll be so much to do , "
16365	16385	16353	16353	her	134	" We know what Mr. Nash thinks of politics : he told us just now he thinks them dreadful . "
16386	16395	16396	16398	the personage impugned	778	" No , not dreadful - only inferior , "
16401	16406	16396	16398	the personage impugned	778	" Everything 's relative . "
16407	16412	16413	16414	Lady Agnes	132	" Inferior to what ? "
16425	16435	16417	16418	Mr. Nash	147	" To anything else that may be in question . "
16436	16443	16445	16446	her ladyship	464	" Nothing else is in question ! "
16463	16467	16472	16472	his	765	" Ah then ! "
16483	16505	16506	16506	Biddy	134	" The ladies whom I was with just now and in whom you were so good as to express an interest ? "
16517	16534	16513	16513	he	765	" They 're persons theatrical . The younger one 's trying to go upon the stage . "
16535	16542	16543	16543	Biddy	134	" And are you assisting her ? "
16554	16576	16543	16543	Biddy	134	" Not in the least - I 'm rather choking her off . I consider it the lowest of the arts . "
16577	16582	16584	16585	Peter Sherringham	144	" Lower than politics ? "
16593	16620	16543	16543	Biddy	134	" Dear no , I wo n't say that . I think the ThĂ Ă tre FranĂ ais a greater institution than the House of Commons . "
16621	16628	16630	16630	Sherringham	144	" I agree with you there ! "
16632	16661	16630	16630	Sherringham	144	" all the more that I do n't consider the dramatic art a low one . It seems to me on the contrary to include all the others . "
16662	16680	16543	16543	Biddy	134	" Yes - that 's a view . I think it 's the view of my friends . "
16681	16686	16630	16630	Sherringham	144	" Of your friends ? "
16687	16716	16543	16543	Biddy	134	" Two ladies - old acquaintances - whom I met in Paris a week ago and whom I 've just been spending an hour with in this place . "
16717	16730	16731	16731	Biddy	134	" You should have seen them ; they struck me very much , "
16737	16755	16543	16543	Biddy	134	" I should like to see them if they really have anything to say to the theatre . "
16756	16770	16772	16773	Gabriel Nash	147	" It can easily be managed . Do you believe in the theatre ? "
16775	16778	16779	16779	Sherringham	144	" Passionately , "
16782	16787	16779	16779	Sherringham	144	" Do n't you ? "
16802	16817	16795	16795	Biddy	134	" How I wish I could go - but in Paris I ca n't ! "
16818	16833	16543	16543	Biddy	134	" I 'll take you , Biddy - I vow I 'll take you . "
16834	16841	16842	16843	the girl	481	" But the plays , Peter , "
16846	16856	16842	16843	the girl	481	" Mamma says they 're worse than the pictures . "
16857	16883	16842	16843	the girl	481	" Oh , we 'll arrange that : they shall do one at the FranĂ ais on purpose for a delightful little yearning English girl . "
16884	16890	16842	16843	the girl	481	" Can you make them ? "
16891	16901	16842	16843	the girl	481	" I can make them do anything I choose . "
16902	16914	16916	16917	Mr. Nash	147	" Ah then it 's the theatre that believes in you , "
16919	16936	16937	16937	Sherringham	144	" It would be ungrateful if it did n't after all I 've done for it ! "
17002	17017	16990	16990	she	132	" Pray should you think it better for a gentleman to be an actor ? "
17018	17038	16990	16990	she	132	" Better than being a politician ? Ah , comedian for comedian , is n't the actor more honest ? "
17051	17060	17039	17040	Lady Agnes	132	" Think of your great father , Nicholas ! "
17061	17068	17070	17070	Nicholas	224	" He was an honest man , "
17072	17083	17070	17070	Nicholas	224	" That 's perhaps why he could n't stand it . "
17128	17155	17122	17122	he	144	" May I ask if the ladies you just spoke of are English - Mrs. and Miss Rooth : is n't that the rather odd name ? "
17156	17188	17122	17122	he	144	" The very same . Only the daughter , according to her kind , desires to be known by some nom de guerre before she has even been able to enlist . "
17189	17197	17122	17122	he	144	" And what does she call herself ? "
17202	17220	17122	17122	he	144	" Maud Vavasour , or Edith Temple , or Gladys Vane - some rubbish of that sort . "
17221	17229	17122	17122	he	144	" What then is her own name ? "
17230	17270	17122	17122	he	144	" Miriam - Miriam Rooth . It would do very well and would give her the benefit of the prepossessing fact that - to the best of my belief at least - she 's more than half a Jewess . "
17271	17280	17281	17281	Sherringham	144	" It is as good as Rachel Felix , "
17284	17302	17122	17122	he	144	" The name 's as good , but not the talent . The girl 's splendidly stupid . "
17303	17317	17318	17318	Sherringham	144	" And more than half a Jewess ? Do n't you believe it ! "
17321	17330	17331	17331	Biddy	134	" Do n't believe she 's a Jewess ? "
17341	17362	17318	17318	Sherringham	144	" No , no - that she 's stupid , really . If she is she 'll be the first . "
17363	17371	17372	17372	Nash	147	" Ah you may judge for yourself , "
17375	17395	17372	17372	Nash	147	" if you 'll come to - morrow afternoon to Madame CarrĂ , Rue de Constantinople , a l'entresol . "
17396	17436	17318	17318	Sherringham	144	" Madame CarrĂ ? Why , I 've already a note from her - I found it this morning on my return to Paris - asking me to look in at five o'clock and listen to a jeune Anglaise . "
17437	17481	17372	17372	Nash	147	" That 's my arrangement - I obtained the favour . The ladies want an opinion , and dear old CarrĂ has consented to see them and to give one . Maud Vavasour will recite , and the venerable artist will pass judgement . "
17500	17536	17484	17484	he	144	" She wishes to make her a little audience - she says she 'll do better with that - and she asks me because I 'm English . I shall make a point of going . "
17537	17557	17558	17559	Mr. Nash	147	" And bring Dormer if you can : the audience will be better . Will you come , Dormer ? "
17567	17588	17558	17559	Mr. Nash	147	" will you come with me to hear an English amateur recite and an old French actress pitch into her ? "
17601	17631	17589	17589	Nick	224	" I 'll go anywhere with you so that , as I 've told you , I may n't lose sight of you - may keep hold of you . "
17632	17643	17644	17645	Lady Agnes	132	" Poor Mr. Nash , why is he so useful ? "
17653	17660	17644	17645	Lady Agnes	132	" He steadies me , mother . "
17661	17672	17673	17673	Biddy	134	" Oh I wish you 'd take me , Peter , "
17681	17701	17702	17704	the young man	445	" To spend an hour with an old French actress ? Do you want to go upon the stage ? "
17707	17721	17644	17645	Lady Agnes	132	" No , but I want to see something - to know something . "
17722	17742	17644	17645	Lady Agnes	132	" Madame CarrĂ 's wonderful in her way , but she 's hardly company for a little English girl . "
17743	17765	17644	17645	Lady Agnes	132	" I 'm not little , I 'm only too big ; and she goes , the person you speak of . "
17766	17777	17779	17780	Mr. Nash	176	" For a professional purpose and with her good mother , "
17782	17793	17779	17780	Mr. Nash	176	" I think Lady Agnes would hardly venture - - ! "
17794	17803	17805	17805	Biddy	134	" Oh I 've seen her good mother ! "
17822	17840	17644	17645	Lady Agnes	132	" Yes , but you have n't heard her . It 's then that you measure her . "
17846	17858	17841	17841	Biddy	134	" Is it the famous Honorine CarrĂ , the great celebrity ? "
17859	17870	17872	17873	Peter Sherringham	144	" Honorine in person : the incomparable , the perfect ! "
17875	17927	17872	17873	Peter Sherringham	144	" The first artist of our time , taking her altogether . She and I are old pals ; she has been so good as to come and ' say ' things - which she does sometimes still dans le monde as no one else can - - in my rooms . "
17928	17939	17841	17841	Biddy	134	" Make her come then . We can go there ! "
17940	17946	17872	17873	Peter Sherringham	144	" One of these days ! "
17947	17964	17841	17841	Biddy	134	" And the young lady - Miriam , Maud , Gladys - make her come too . "
17975	17989	17970	17971	the latter	686	" Oh you 'll have no difficulty . She 'll jump at it ! "
17990	18016	18017	18018	This gentleman	769	" Very good . I 'll give a little artistic tea - with Julia too of course . And you must come , Mr. Nash . "
18028	18057	18025	18025	Peter	144	" But if , as you say , you 're not for helping the young lady , how came you to arrange this interview with the great model ? "
18058	18085	17970	17971	the latter	686	" Precisely to stop her short . The great model will find her very bad . Her judgements , as you probably know , are Rhadamanthine . "
18086	18090	18092	18092	Biddy	134	" Unfortunate creature ! "
18094	18101	18092	18092	Biddy	134	" I think you 're cruel . "
18102	18112	18113	18113	Sherringham	144	" Never mind - I 'll look after them , "
18116	18129	18113	18113	Sherringham	144	" And how can Madame CarrĂ judge if the girl recites English ? "
18130	18144	18145	18145	Peter	144	" She 's so intelligent that she could judge if she recited Chinese , "
18148	18162	18164	18165	Gabriel Nash	147	" That 's true , but the jeune Anglaise recites also in French , "
18167	18174	18113	18113	Sherringham	144	" Then she is n't stupid . "
18175	18191	18113	18113	Sherringham	144	" And in Italian , and in several more tongues , for aught I know . "
18197	18209	18192	18192	Sherringham	144	" Very good - we 'll put her through them all . "
18210	18217	18218	18218	Biddy	134	" She must be most clever , "
18223	18247	18192	18192	Sherringham	144	" She has spent her life on the Continent ; she has wandered about with her mother ; she has picked up things . "
18248	18255	18256	18256	Biddy	134	" And is she a lady ? "
18259	18296	18113	18113	Sherringham	144	" Oh tremendous ! The great ones of the earth on the mother 's side . On the father 's , on the other hand , I imagine , only a Jew stockbroker in the City . "
18297	18308	18309	18309	Sherringham	144	" Then they 're rich - or ought to be , "
18312	18603	18604	18605	Mr. Nash	147	" Ought to be - ah there 's the bitterness ! The stockbroker had too short a go - he was carried off in his flower . However , he left his wife a certain property , which she appears to have muddled away , not having the safeguard of being herself a Hebrew . This is what she has lived on till to - day - this and another resource . Her husband , as she has often told me , had the artistic temperament : that 's common , as you know , among ces messieurs . He made the most of his little opportunities and collected various pictures , tapestries , enamels , porcelains , and similar gewgaws . He parted with them also , I gather , at a profit ; in short he carried on a neat little business as a brocanteur . It was nipped in the bud , but Mrs. Rooth was left with a certain number of these articles in her hands ; indeed they must have formed her only capital . She was not a woman of business ; she turned them , no doubt , to indifferent account ; but she sold them piece by piece , and they kept her going while her daughter grew up . It was to this precarious traffic , conducted with extraordinary mystery and delicacy , that , five years ago , in Florence , I was indebted for my acquaintance with her . In those days I used to collect - heaven help me ! - I used to pick up rubbish which I could ill afford . It was a little phase - we have our little phases , have n't we ? "
18611	18832	18604	18605	Mr. Nash	147	" and I 've come out on the other side . Mrs. Rooth had an old green pot and I heard of her old green pot . To hear of it was to long for it , so that I went to see it under cover of night . I bought it and a couple of years ago I overturned and smashed it . It was the last of the little phase . It was not , however , as you 've seen , the last of Mrs. Rooth . I met her afterwards in London , and I found her a year or two ago in Venice . She appears to be a great wanderer . She had other old pots , of other colours , red , yellow , black , or blue - she could produce them of any complexion you liked . I do n't know whether she carried them about with her or whether she had little secret stores in the principal cities of Europe . To - day at any rate they seem all gone . On the other hand she has her daughter , who has grown up and who 's a precious vase of another kind - less fragile I hope than the rest . May she not be overturned and smashed ! "
18867	18899	18861	18862	Mr. Nash	147	" A Jewish stockbroker , a dealer in curiosities : what an odd person to marry - for a person who was well born ! I daresay he was a German . "
18900	18925	18926	18926	Sherringham	144	" His name must have been simply Roth , and the poor lady , to smarten it up , has put in another o , "
18930	18937	18939	18939	Gabriel	147	" You 're both very clever , "
18941	19098	18939	18939	Gabriel	147	" and Rudolf Roth , as I happen to know , was indeed the designation of Maud Vavasour 's papa . But so far as the question of derogation goes one might as well drown as starve - for what connexion is not a misalliance when one happens to have the unaccommodating , the crushing honour of being a Neville - Nugent of Castle Nugent ? That 's the high lineage of Maud 's mamma . I seem to have heard it mentioned that Rudolf Roth was very versatile and , like most of his species , not unacquainted with the practice of music . He had been employed to teach the harmonium to Miss Neville - Nugent and she had profited by his lessons . If his daughter 's like him - and she 's not like her mother - he was darkly and dangerously handsome . So I venture rapidly to reconstruct the situation . "
19167	19178	19164	19164	she	132	" Castle Nugent - where in the world 's that ? "
19179	19205	19147	19147	she	132	" It 's a domain of immeasurable extent and almost inconceivable splendour , but I fear not to be found in any prosaic earthly geography ! "
19234	19237	19216	19216	she	132	" order , "
19249	19262	19240	19241	Mr. Nash	147	" It must be on the banks of the Manzanares or the Guadalquivir "
19326	19440	19320	19321	the speaker	644	" I do n't know that I understand your question ; there are different ways of taking it . Do I think it 's important ? Is that what you mean ? Important certainly to managers and stage - carpenters who want to make money , to ladies and gentlemen who want to produce themselves in public by limelight , and to other ladies and gentlemen who are bored and stupid and do n't know what to do with their evening . It 's a commercial and social convenience which may be infinitely worked . But important artistically , intellectually ? How can it be - so poor , so limited a form ? "
19441	19466	19467	19467	Sherringham	144	" Upon my honour it strikes me as rich and various ! Do you think it 's a poor and limited form , Nick ? "
19475	19492	19467	19467	Sherringham	144	" I think whatever Nash thinks . I 've no opinion to - day but his . "
19541	19553	19554	19554	Nash	147	" Oh I used to be of your way of feeling , "
19560	19585	19554	19554	Nash	147	" I understand you perfectly . It 's a phase like another . I 've been through it - j'ai Ă tĂ comme Ă a. "
19586	19614	19558	19558	Sherringham	144	" And you went then very often to the ThĂ Ă tre FranĂ ais , and it was there I saw you . I place you now . "
19615	19627	19628	19628	Nash	147	" I 'm afraid I noticed none of the other spectators , "
19631	19689	19628	19628	Nash	147	" I had no attention but for the great CarrĂ - she was still on the stage . Judge of my infatuation , and how I can allow for yours , when I tell you that I sought her acquaintance , that I could n't rest till I had told her how I hung upon her lips . "
19690	19699	19700	19700	Sherringham	144	" That 's just what I told her , "
19703	19722	19558	19558	Sherringham	144	" She was very kind to me . She said : ' Vous me rendez des forces . ' "
19723	19733	19558	19558	Sherringham	144	" That 's just what she said to me ! "
19734	19743	19558	19558	Sherringham	144	" And we 've remained very good friends . "
19744	19749	19751	19751	Sherringham	144	" So have we ! "
19753	19779	19751	19751	Sherringham	144	" And such perfect art as hers - do you mean to say you do n't consider that important , such a rare dramatic intelligence ? "
19780	19793	19795	19795	Nash	147	" I 'm afraid you read the feuilletons . You catch their phrases "
19800	19812	19795	19795	Nash	147	" Dramatic intelligence is never rare ; nothing 's more common . "
19813	19823	19558	19558	Sherringham	144	" Then why have we so many shocking actors ? "
19824	19920	19795	19795	Nash	147	" Have we ? I thought they were mostly good ; succeeding more easily and more completely in that business than in anything else . What could they do - those people generally - if they did n't do that poor thing ? And reflect that the poor thing enables them to succeed ! Of course , always , there are numbers of people on the stage who are no actors at all , for it 's even easier to our poor humanity to be ineffectively stupid and vulgar than to bring down the house . "
19921	19942	19943	19943	Sherringham	144	" It 's not easy , by what I can see , to produce , completely , any artistic effect , "
19946	19989	19943	19943	Sherringham	144	" and those the actor produces are among the most momentous we know . You 'll not persuade me that to watch such an actress as Madame CarrĂ was n't an education of the taste , an enlargement of one 's knowledge . "
19990	20073	19795	19795	Nash	147	" She did what she could , poor woman , but in what belittling , coarsening conditions ! She had to interpret a character in a play , and a character in a play - not to say the whole piece : I speak more particularly of modern pieces - is such a wretchedly small peg to hang anything on ! The dramatist shows us so little , is so hampered by his audience , is restricted to so poor an analysis . "
20074	20094	20096	20097	Peter Sherringham	144	" I know the complaint . It 's all the fashion now . The raffinĂ s despise the theatre , "
20120	20125	19795	19795	Nash	147	" Connu , connu ! "
20126	20518	19795	19795	Nash	147	" It will be known better yet , wo n't it ? when the essentially brutal nature of the modern audience is still more perceived , when it has been properly analysed : the omnium gatherum of the population of a big commercial city at the hour of the day when their taste is at its lowest , flocking out of hideous hotels and restaurants , gorged with food , stultified with buying and selling and with all the other sordid preoccupations of the age , squeezed together in a sweltering mass , disappointed in their seats , timing the author , timing the actor , wishing to get their money back on the spot - all before eleven o'clock . Fancy putting the exquisite before such a tribunal as that ! There 's not even a question of it . The dramatist would n't if he could , and in nine cases out of ten he could n't if he would . He has to make the basest concessions . One of his principal canons is that he must enable his spectators to catch the suburban trains , which stop at 11.30 . What would you think of any other artist - the painter or the novelist - whose governing forces should be the dinner and the suburban trains ? The old dramatists did n't defer to them - not so much at least - and that 's why they 're less and less actable . If they 're touched - the large loose men - it 's only to be mutilated and trivialised . Besides , they had a simpler civilisation to represent - societies in which the life of man was in action , in passion , in immediate and violent expression . Those things could be put upon the playhouse boards with comparatively little sacrifice of their completeness and their truth . To - day we 're so infinitely more reflective and complicated and diffuse that it makes all the difference . What can you do with a character , with an idea , with a feeling , between dinner and the suburban trains ? You can give a gross , rough sketch of them , but how little you touch them , how bald you leave them ! What crudity compared with what the novelist does ! "
20519	20528	20529	20529	Peter	144	" Do you write novels , Mr. Nash ? "
20533	20574	19795	19795	Nash	147	" No , but I read them when they 're extraordinarily good , and I do n't go to plays . I read Balzac for instance - I encounter the admirable portrait of ValĂ rie Marneffe in La Cousine Bette . "
20575	20610	20529	20529	Peter	144	" And you contrast it with the poverty of Emile Augier 's SĂ raphine in Les Lionnes Pauvres ? I was awaiting you there . That 's the cheval de bataille of you fellows . "
20611	20621	19795	19795	Nash	147	" What an extraordinary discussion ! What dreadful authors ! "
20652	20701	20647	20648	Peter Sherringham	144	" I 've seen Madame CarrĂ in things of the modern repertory , which she has made as vivid to me , caused to abide as ineffaceably in my memory , as ValĂ rie Marneffe . She 's the Balzac , as one may say , of actresses . "
20702	20713	20714	20714	Nash	147	" The miniaturist , as it were , of whitewashers ! "
20740	20762	20726	20726	Sherringham	144	" You 'd be magnanimous if you thought the young lady you 've introduced to our old friend would be important . "
20769	20782	20763	20764	Mr. Nash	147	" She might be much more so than she ever will be . "
20840	20851	20832	20832	Sherringham	144	" Perhaps she 'll be more so than you think . "
20852	20863	20837	20837	his	144	" Perhaps - if you take an interest in her ! "
20864	20892	20832	20832	Sherringham	144	" A mystic voice seems to exhort me to do so , to whisper that though I 've never seen her I shall find something in her . "
20898	20914	20895	20895	Peter	144	" What do you say , Biddy - shall I take an interest in her ? "
20935	20947	20915	20916	The girl	481	" If she 's not nice I do n't advise it . "
20948	20955	20981	20981	she	132	" And if she is nice ? "
20956	20963	20971	20971	his	458	" You advise it still less ! "
20989	21011	20981	20981	she	132	" Heaven help us , what chance has a girl of mine with a man who 's so agog about actresses ? "
21104	21115	21116	21116	she	132	" Let us leave this - let us leave this ! "
21147	21161	21139	21140	her son	452	" You know you do n't escape me ; I stick to you ! "
21171	21185	21164	21165	Lady Agnes	132	" Pardon my reminding you that you 're going to call on Julia . "
21186	21212	21164	21165	Lady Agnes	132	" Well , ca n't Nash also come to call on Julia ? That 's just what I want - that she should see him . "
21223	21289	21213	21214	Peter Sherringham	144	" A better way perhaps will be for them to meet under my auspices at my ' dramatic tea . ' This will enable me to return one favour for another . If Mr. Nash is so good as to introduce me to this aspirant for honours we estimate so differently , I 'll introduce him to my sister , a much more positive quantity . "
21290	21304	21305	21306	Grace Dormer	140	" It 's easy to see who 'll have the best of it ! "
21375	21390	21391	21391	Sherringham	144	" Nick will bring you . I 've a little corner at the embassy , "
21394	21413	21391	21391	Sherringham	144	" You 're very kind . You must bring him then to - morrow - Rue de Constantinople . "
21414	21424	21391	21391	Sherringham	144	" At five o'clock - do n't be afraid . "
21425	21429	21430	21430	Biddy	134	" Oh dear ! "
21700	21704	21707	21707	he	224	" lots of things "
22192	22195	22196	22196	They	859	" funny . "
22461	22468	22470	22470	Grace	140	" A French hat , mamma ? "
22472	22481	22470	22470	Grace	140	" Oh do wait till she gets home ! "
22482	22494	22495	22495	Biddy	134	" I think they 're really prettier here , you know , "
22504	22511	22499	22500	Lady Agnes	132	" I daresay they 're cheaper . "
22521	22529	22499	22500	Lady Agnes	132	" I daresay Peter thinks them becoming . "
23313	23330	23304	23304	Nick	224	" You can knock about with the girls , you know ; everything 's amusing here . "
23529	23539	23540	23541	Peter Sherringham	144	" Who in the world 's your comic friend ? "
23553	23571	23540	23541	Peter Sherringham	144	" Ah there 's something else you lost by going to Cambridge - you lost Gabriel Nash ! "
23572	23580	23581	23581	Sherringham	144	" He sounds like an Elizabethan dramatist , "
23584	23607	23581	23581	Sherringham	144	" But I have n't lost him , since it appears now I sha n't be able to have you without him . "
23608	23668	23540	23541	Peter Sherringham	144	" Oh , as for that , wait a little . I 'm going to try him again , but I do n't know how he wears . What I mean is that you 've probably lost his freshness , which was the great thing . I rather fear he 's becoming conventional , or at any rate serious . "
23669	23679	23581	23581	Sherringham	144	" Bless me , do you call that serious ? "
23680	23704	23540	23541	Peter Sherringham	144	" He used to be so gay . He had a real genius for playing with ideas . He was a wonderful talker . "
23705	23716	23718	23719	Peter Sherringham	144	" It seems to me he does very well now , "
23721	23801	23540	23541	Peter Sherringham	144	" Oh this is nothing . He had great flights of old , very great flights ; one saw him rise and rise and turn somersaults in the blue - one wondered how far he could go . He 's very intelligent , and I should think it might be interesting to find out what it is that prevents the whole man from being as good as his parts . I mean in case he is n't so good . "
23802	23824	23540	23541	Peter Sherringham	144	" I see you more than suspect that . May n't it be simply that he 's too great an ass ? "
23825	23893	23540	23541	Peter Sherringham	144	" That would be the whole - I shall see in time - but it certainly is n't one of the parts . It may be the effect , but it is n't the cause , and it 's for the cause I claim an interest . Do you think him an ass for what he said about the theatre - his pronouncing it a coarse art ? "
23894	23906	23908	23908	Sherringham	144	" To differ from you about him that reason would do , "
23910	23942	23908	23908	Sherringham	144	" The only bad one would be one that should n't preserve our difference . You need n't tell me you agree with him , for frankly I do n't care . "
23943	23950	23951	23952	Nick Dormer	224	" Then your passion still burns ? "
23955	23960	23540	23541	Peter Sherringham	144	" My passion - ? "
23961	24029	23540	23541	Peter Sherringham	144	" I do n't mean for any individual exponent of the equivocal art : mark the guilty conscience , mark the rising blush , mark the confusion of mind ! I mean the old sign one knew you best by ; your permanent stall at the FranĂ ais , your inveterate attendance at premieres , the way you ' follow ' the young talents and the old . "
24030	24047	24048	24048	Sherringham	144	" Yes , it 's still my little hobby , my little folly if you like , "
24051	24334	24048	24048	Sherringham	144	" I do n't find I get tired of it . What will you have ? Strong predilections are rather a blessing ; they 're simplifying . I 'm fond of representation - the representation of life : I like it better , I think , than the real thing . You like it too , you 'd be ready in other conditions to go in for it , in your way - so you 've no right to cast the stone . You like it best done by one vehicle and I by another ; and our preference on either side has a deep root in us . There 's a fascination to me in the way the actor does it , when his talent - ah he must have that ! - has been highly trained . Ah it must be that ! The things he can do in this effort at representation , with the dramatist to back him , seem to me innumerable - he can carry it to a point ! - and I take great pleasure in observing them , in recognising and comparing them . It 's an amusement like another - I do n't pretend to call it by any exalted name , but in this vale of friction it will serve . One can lose one 's self in it , and it has the recommendation - in common , I suppose , with the study of the other arts - that the further you go in it the more you find . So I go rather far , if you will . But is it the principal sign one knows me by ? "
24339	24347	24348	24348	Nick	224	" Do n't be ashamed of it , "
24351	24422	24348	24348	Nick	224	" else it will be ashamed of you . I ought to discriminate . You 're distinguished among my friends and relations by your character of rising young diplomatist ; but you know I always want the final touch to the picture , the last fruit of analysis . Therefore I make out that you 're conspicuous among rising young diplomatists for the infatuation you describe in such pretty terms . "
24423	24447	24670	24670	Sherringham	144	" You evidently believe it will prevent my ever rising very high . But pastime for pastime is it any idler than yours ? "
24448	24452	24348	24348	Nick	224	" Than mine ? "
24453	24649	24670	24670	Sherringham	144	" Why you 've half - a - dozen while I only allow myself the luxury of one . For the theatre 's my sole vice , really . Is this more wanton , say , than to devote weeks to the consideration of the particular way in which your friend Mr. Nash may be most intensely a twaddler and a bore ? That 's not my ideal of choice recreation , but I 'd undertake to satisfy you about him sooner . You 're a young statesman - who happens to be an en disponibilitĂ for the moment - but you spend not a little of your time in besmearing canvas with bright - coloured pigments . The idea of representation fascinates you , but in your case it 's representation in oils - or do you practise water - colours and pastel too ? You even go much further than I , for I study my art of predilection only in the works of others . I do n't aspire to leave works of my own . You 're a painter , possibly a great one ; but I 'm not an actor . "
24680	24702	24670	24670	Sherringham	144	" Let me add that , considering you are a painter , your portrait of the complicated Nash is lamentably dim . "
24703	24766	24670	24670	Sherringham	144	" He 's not at all complicated ; he 's only too simple to give an account of . Most people have a lot of attributes and appendages that dress them up and superscribe them , and what I like Gabriel for is that he has n't any at all . It makes him , it keeps him , so refreshingly cool . "
24767	24794	24795	24795	Sherringham	144	" By Jove , you match him there ! Is n't it an appendage and an attribute to escape kicking ? How does he manage that ? "
24798	24962	24670	24670	Sherringham	144	" I have n't the least idea - I do n't know that he does n't rouse the kicking impulse . Besides , he can kick back and I do n't think any one has ever seen him duck or dodge . His means , his profession , his belongings have never anything to do with the question . He does n't shade off into other people ; he 's as neat as an outline cut out of paper with scissors . I like him , therefore , because in dealing with him you know what you 've got hold of . With most men you do n't : to pick the flower you must break off the whole dusty , thorny , worldly branch ; you find you 're taking up in your grasp all sorts of other people and things , dangling accidents and conditions . Poor Nash has none of those encumbrances : he 's the solitary - fragrant blossom . "
24963	24980	24981	24981	Sherringham	144	" My dear fellow , you 'd be better for a little of the same pruning ! "
25448	25451	25446	25446	he	224	" kept on "
25535	25537	25525	25525	he	224	" representation "
25717	25975	25671	25671	Nick	224	" quite out of that sphere . It was not for studios certainly that Mr. Carteret sent cheques ; but they were an expression of general confidence in Nick , and a little expansion was natural to a young man enjoying such a luxury as that . It was sufficiently felt in Calcutta Gardens that he could be looked to not to betray such confidence ; for Mr. Carteret 's behaviour could have no name at all unless one were prepared to call it encouraging . He had never promised anything , but he was one of the delightful persons with whom the redemption precedes or dispenses with the vow . He had been an early and lifelong friend of the late right honourable gentleman , a political follower , a devoted admirer , a stanch supporter in difficult hours . He had never married , espousing nothing more reproductive than Sir Nicholas 's views - he used to write letters to the Times in favour of them - and had , so far as was known , neither chick nor child ; nothing but an amiable little family of eccentricities , the flower of which was his odd taste for living in a small , steep , clean country town , all green gardens and red walls with a girdle of hedge - rows , all clustered about an immense brown old abbey . When Lady Agnes 's imagination rested upon the future of her second son she liked to remember that Mr. Carteret had nothing to "
25978	25991	25671	25671	Nick	224	" : the inference seemed so direct that he would keep up Nick .
26486	26495	26458	26459	Sir Nicholas	224	" co - ordinating power in relation to detail "
26860	26862	26884	26884	Peter	144	" chaff "
27495	27515	27490	27490	She	138	" Are we going to dine here ? Oh dear , why did n't you have a private room ? "
28528	28534	28535	28535	Julia	138	" Oh anything for Biddy ! "
28776	28800	28767	28767	Julia	138	" You might have come to see me to - day , you know . Did n't you get my message from Peter ? "
28801	28817	28819	28820	Lady Agnes	132	" Scold him , Julia - scold him well . I begged him to go , "
28831	28841	28827	28827	her	140	" Oh Julia , do give it to him ! "
28995	29007	29008	29008	she	166	" He ought to have gone ; he owed you that , "
29012	29044	29008	29008	she	166	" but it 's very true he would have had the same luck as we . I went with the girls directly after luncheon . I suppose you got our card . "
29045	29055	29057	29058	Mrs. Dallow	166	" He might have come after I came in , "
29060	29081	29082	29082	Nick	224	" Dear Julia , I 'm going to see you to - night . I 've been waiting for that , "
29085	29098	29100	29101	Lady Agnes	132	" Of course we had no idea when you 'd come in , "
29103	29122	29123	29123	Julia	138	" I 'm so sorry . You must come to - morrow . I hate calls at night , "
29127	29146	29147	29147	Nick	224	" Well then , will you roam with me ? Will you wander through Paris on my arm ? "
29152	29161	29147	29147	Nick	224	" Will you take a drive with me ? "
29162	29169	29171	29171	Grace	140	" Oh that would be perfection ! "
29173	29188	29189	29189	Biddy	134	" I thought we were all going somewhere - to the Hippodrome , Peter , "
29192	29202	29204	29204	Peter	144	" Oh not all ; just you and me ! "
29206	29221	29222	29223	Lady Agnes	132	" I 'm going home to my bed . I 've earned my rest , "
29226	29233	29235	29235	Grace	140	" Ca n't Peter take us ? "
29237	29263	29235	29235	Grace	140	" Nick can take you home , mamma , if Julia wo n't receive him , and I can look perfectly after Peter and Biddy . "
29264	29275	29276	29277	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Take them to something amusing ; please take them , "
29308	29316	29317	29317	she	166	" You 're tired , poor dear , "
29323	29338	29317	29317	she	166	" Fancy your being dragged about so ! What did you come over for ? "
29339	29348	29349	29349	Nick	224	" My mother came because I brought her , "
29352	29385	29349	29349	Nick	224	" It 's I who have dragged her about . I brought her for a little change . I thought it would do her good . I wanted to see the Salon . "
29386	29425	29426	29426	Julia	138	" It is n't a bad time . I 've a carriage and you must use it ; you must use nothing else . It shall take you everywhere . I 'll drive you about to - morrow . "
29559	29563	29564	29564	she	132	" Dear Julia ! "
29588	29596	29597	29597	she	132	" It 's so interesting about Harsh , "
29600	29606	29597	29597	she	132	" We 're immensely excited . "
29607	29631	29632	29632	Julia	138	" Yes , Nick looks it . Merci , pas de vin . It 's just the thing for you , you know , "
29637	29658	29597	29597	she	132	" To be sure he knows it . He 's immensely grateful . It 's really very kind of you . "
29659	29670	29671	29671	Nick	224	" You do me a very great honour , Julia , "
29676	29684	29685	29686	that lady	1053	" Do n't be tiresome , please , "
29689	29705	29706	29706	Nick	224	" We 'll talk about it later . Of course there are lots of points , "
29709	29733	29706	29706	Nick	224	" At present let 's be purely convivial . Somehow Harsh is such a false note here . Nous causerons de Ă a . "
29734	29750	29751	29752	Peter Sherringham	144	" My dear fellow , you 've caught exactly the tone of Mr. Gabriel Nash , "
29757	29764	29765	29766	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Who 's Mr. Gabriel Nash ? "
29769	29781	29782	29783	Grace Dormer	140	" Nick , is he a gentleman ? Biddy says so , "
29791	29808	29809	29810	Lady Agnes	132	" It 's to be supposed that any one Nick brings to lunch with us - ! "
29815	29824	29825	29826	her son	452	" Ah Grace , with your tremendous standard ! "
29864	29875	29876	29876	Julia	138	" I have n't the least desire to see him , "
29880	29895	29876	29876	Julia	138	" any more than I have to talk about Harsh and bore poor Peter . "
29896	29907	29908	29909	her brother	458	" Oh certainly , dear , you 'd bore me , "
29913	29936	29937	29938	Mrs. Dallow	166	" One thing at a time then . Let us by all means be convivial . Only you must show me how , "
29944	29969	29937	29938	Mrs. Dallow	166	" What does he mean , Cousin Agnes ? Does he want us to drain the wine - cup , to flash with repartee ? "
29970	29977	29979	29979	Nick	224	" You 'll do very well , "
29981	29990	29979	29979	Nick	224	" You 're thoroughly charming to - night . "
29991	30013	30014	30014	Biddy	134	" Do go to Peter 's , Julia , if you want something exciting . You 'll see a wonderful girl , "
30023	30028	30014	30014	Biddy	134	" Wonderful for what ? "
30029	30040	30042	30044	the roguish Biddy	1059	" For thinking she can act when she ca n't , "
30046	30063	30014	30014	Biddy	134	" Dear me , what people you all know ! I hate Peter 's theatrical people . "
30064	30074	30075	30076	Lady Agnes	132	" And are n't you going home , Julia ? "
30079	30085	30075	30076	Lady Agnes	132	" Home to the hotel ? "
30086	30099	30014	30014	Biddy	134	" Dear , no , to Harsh - to see about everything . "
30100	30115	30075	30076	Lady Agnes	132	" I 'm in the midst of telegrams . I do n't know yet . "
30116	30128	30129	30130	Lady Agnes	132	" I suppose there 's no doubt they 'll have him , "
30135	30141	30075	30076	Lady Agnes	132	" Who 'll have whom ? "
30142	30165	30075	30076	Lady Agnes	132	" Why , the local people and the party managers . I 'm speaking of the question of my son 's standing . "
30166	30207	30208	30208	Julia	138	" They 'll have the person I want them to have , I daresay . There are so many people in it , in one way or another - it 's dreadful . I like the way you sit there , "
30214	30219	30220	30220	he	224	" So do I , "
30658	30665	30666	30667	Lady Agnes	132	" Do be nice to her , "
30835	30843	30832	30832	she	138	" Oh I say , well go ! "
30873	30889	30890	30890	she	138	" Well , it can go away again . I do n't want a carriage , "
30893	30898	30890	30890	she	138	" I want to walk "
31060	31071	31072	31073	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Where shall we go , what shall we do ? "
31097	31126	31224	31224	Julia	138	" Anywhere you like . It 's so warm we might drive instead of going indoors . We might go to the Bois . That would be agreeable . "
31127	31174	31224	31224	Julia	138	" Yes , but it would n't be walking . However , that does n't matter . It 's mild enough for anything - for sitting out like all these people . And I 've never walked in Paris at night . It would amuse me . "
31178	31192	31175	31175	Nick	224	" So it might , but it is n't particularly recommended to ladies . "
31193	31207	31224	31224	Julia	138	" I do n't care for that if it happens to suit me . "
31208	31223	31175	31175	Nick	224	" Very well then , we 'll walk to the Bastille if you like . "
31235	31250	31252	31252	she	138	" It 's too far ; I 'm tired ; we 'll sit here . "
31260	31262	31175	31175	Nick	224	" terrace "
31267	31356	31252	31252	she	138	" This will do ; it 's amusing enough and we can look at the Madeleine - that 's respectable . If we must have something we 'll have a madere - is that respectable ? Not particularly ? So much the better . What are those people having ? Bocks ? Could n't we have bocks ? Are they very low ? Then I shall have one . I 've been so wonderfully good - I 've been staying at Versailles : je me dois bien cela . "
31509	31526	31527	31527	Nick	224	" Therefore why be sapient and solemn about it , like an editorial in a newspaper ? "
31548	31570	31545	31545	she	610	" If you do n't want to stand you 've only to say so . You need n't give your reasons . "
31571	31645	31545	31545	she	610	" It 's too kind of you to let me off that ! And then I 'm a tremendous fellow for reasons ; that 's my strong point , do n't you know ? I 've a lot more besides those I 've mentioned , done up and ready for delivery . The odd thing is that they do n't always govern my behaviour . I rather think I do want to stand . "
31646	31657	31658	31658	Julia	138	" Then what you said just now was a speech , "
31661	31665	31545	31545	she	610	" A speech ? "
31666	31678	31545	31545	she	610	" The ' rot , ' the humbug of the hustings . "
31679	31734	31545	31545	she	610	" No , those great truths remain , and a good many others . But an inner voice tells me I 'm in for it . And it will be much more graceful to embrace this opportunity , accepting your co - operation , than to wait for some other and forfeit that advantage . "
31735	31746	31747	31747	she	138	" I shall be very glad to help you anywhere , "
31751	31755	31756	31756	he	1106	" Thanks awfully , "
31769	31792	31763	31763	his	1106	" You 'd do it best in your own place , and I 've no right to deny myself such a help . "
31797	31805	31793	31793	Julia	138	" I do n't do it badly . "
31806	31813	31747	31747	she	138	" Ah you 're so political ! "
31814	31887	31888	31888	Nick	224	" Of course I am ; it 's the only decent thing to be . But I can only help you if you 'll help yourself . I can do a good deal , but I ca n't do everything . If you 'll work I 'll work with you ; but if you 're going into it with your hands in your pockets I 'll have nothing to do with you . "
31908	31932	31888	31888	Nick	224	" You 're very clever , but you must really take a little trouble . Things do n't drop into people 's mouths . "
31933	31948	31949	31949	he	224	" I 'll try - I 'll try . I 've a great incentive , "
31952	31958	31888	31888	Nick	224	" Of course you have . "
31959	31967	31968	31968	Julia	138	" My mother , my poor mother . "
31978	31999	31974	31974	he	224	" And of course always my father , dear good man . My mother 's even more political than you . "
32000	32010	32012	32013	Mrs. Dallow	166	" I daresay she is , and quite right ! "
32015	32040	31888	31888	Nick	224	" And she ca n't tell me a bit more than you can what she thinks , what she believes , what she wants . "
32041	32066	31888	31888	Nick	224	" Pardon me , I can tell you perfectly . There 's one thing I always immensely want - to keep out a Tory . "
32067	32077	31888	31888	Nick	224	" I see . That 's a great philosophy . "
32078	32101	31888	31888	Nick	224	" It will do very well . And I desire the good of the country . I 'm not ashamed of that . "
32102	32121	31888	31888	Nick	224	" And can you give me an idea of what it is - the good of the country ? "
32122	32141	31888	31888	Nick	224	" I know perfectly what it is n't . It is n't what the Tories want to do . "
32142	32150	31888	31888	Nick	224	" What do they want to do ? "
32151	32167	31888	31888	Nick	224	" Oh it would take me long to tell you . All sorts of trash . "
32168	32231	31888	31888	Nick	224	" It would take you long , and it would take them longer ! All they want to do is to prevent us from doing . On our side we want to prevent them from preventing us . That 's about as clearly as we all see it . So on both sides it 's a beautiful , lucid , inspiring programme . "
32232	32240	31888	31888	Nick	224	" I do n't believe in you , "
32253	32262	32263	32263	He	1108	" I hope not , Julia , indeed ! "
32285	32344	32282	32282	he	1108	" You 're a very accomplished woman and a very zealous one ; but you have n't an idea , you know - not to call an idea . What you mainly want is to be at the head of a political salon ; to start one , to keep it up , to make it a success . "
32345	32351	32352	32352	Julia	138	" Much you know me ! "
32370	32386	32387	32387	Nick	224	" You 'll have it in time , but I wo n't come to it , "
32391	32401	32387	32387	Nick	224	" You ca n't come less than you do . "
32402	32426	32282	32282	he	1108	" When I say you 'll have it I mean you 've already got it . That 's why I do n't come . "
32427	32438	32440	32441	Mrs. Dallow	166	" I do n't think you know what you mean , "
32443	32489	32440	32441	Mrs. Dallow	166	" I 've an idea that 's as good as any of yours , any of those you 've treated me to this evening , it seems to me - the simple idea that one ought to do something or other for one 's country . "
32490	32522	32282	32282	he	1108	" ' Something or other ' certainly covers all the ground . There 's one thing one can always do for one 's country , which is not to be afraid . "
32523	32528	32440	32441	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Afraid of what ? "
32547	32566	32567	32567	he	224	" I 'll tell you another time . It 's very well to talk so glibly of standing , "
32570	32588	32543	32543	he	224	" but it is n't absolutely foreign to the question that I have n't got the cash . "
32589	32596	32597	32597	she	166	" What did you do before ? "
32600	32608	32543	32543	he	224	" The first time my father paid . "
32609	32615	32543	32543	he	224	" And the other time ? "
32616	32621	32543	32543	he	224	" Oh Mr. Carteret . "
32622	32636	32638	32638	Julia	138	" Your expenses wo n't be at all large ; on the contrary , "
32640	32661	32543	32543	he	224	" They sha n't be ; I shall look out sharp for that . I shall have the great Hutchby . "
32662	32677	32678	32678	She	166	" Of course ; but you know I want you to do it well . "
32685	32696	32678	32678	She	166	" Of course you can send the bill to me . "
32697	32713	32714	32715	Nick Dormer	224	" Thanks awfully ; you 're tremendously kind . I should n't think of that . "
32745	32752	32753	32753	he	224	" I shall manage it somehow , "
32757	32764	32766	32766	Julia	138	" Mr. Carteret will be delighted , "
32768	32780	32743	32743	her	166	" I daresay , but I hate taking people 's money . "
32781	32799	32766	32766	Julia	138	" That 's nonsense - when it 's for the country . Is n't it for them ? "
32800	32807	32808	32808	Nick	224	" When they get it back ! "
32819	32830	32808	32808	Nick	224	" It 's startlingly late ; you must be tired . "
32870	32886	32865	32868	his cousin 's maid	1111	" Mr. Carteret will expect so much if he pays . And so would you . "
32887	32907	32909	32910	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Yes , I 'm bound to say I should ! I should expect a great deal - everything . "
32921	32946	32917	32917	she	166	" If you 're riding for a fall , if you 're only going in to miss it , you had better stay out . "
32947	32956	32957	32959	the young man	445	" How can I miss it with you ? "
32975	32988	32972	32972	he	445	" And even if I do it will have been immense fun . "
32989	32995	32997	32997	Julia	138	" It is immense fun , "
32999	33015	32997	32997	Julia	138	" But the best fun is to win . If you do n't - - ! "
33016	33022	33023	33023	he	445	" If I do n't ? "
33029	33038	32997	32997	Julia	138	" I 'll never speak to you again . "
33039	33051	33052	33053	Mrs. Dallow	166	" How much you expect even when you do n't pay ! "
33126	33140	33142	33142	Nick	224	" Oh they 'll fight it hard ; they 'll put up Kingsbury , "
33148	33169	33142	33142	Nick	224	" They 'll all come down - all that can get away . And Kingsbury has a very handsome wife . "
33170	33180	33181	33181	Julia	138	" She 's not so handsome as your cousin , "
33184	33199	33205	33205	he	224	" Oh dear , no - a cousin sooner than a wife any day ! "
33237	33248	33234	33234	he	224	" I 'll do any blessed thing you tell me . "
33249	33262	33263	33263	She	138	" Come here to - morrow then - as early as ten . "
33283	33297	33279	33279	she	138	" Pray is n't a gentleman to do anything , to be anything ? "
33298	33305	33279	33279	she	138	" To be anything - - ? "
33306	33317	33279	33279	she	138	" If he does n't aspire to serve the State . "
33318	33341	33279	33279	she	138	" Aspire to make his political fortune , do you mean ? Oh bless me , yes , there are other things . "
33342	33352	33279	33279	she	138	" What other things that can compare with that ? "
33353	33368	33279	33279	she	138	" Well , I for instance , I 'm very fond of the arts . "
33369	33374	33375	33375	she	138	" Of the arts ? "
33378	33393	33279	33279	she	138	" Did you never hear of them ? I 'm awfully fond of painting . "
33420	33430	33431	33431	she	138	" Do n't be odious ! Good - night , "
34482	34490	34491	34491	she	1153	" So much depends - really everything ! "
34503	34509	34511	34511	she	1153	" It 's either this , "
34520	34531	34511	34511	she	1153	" or it 's - I do n't know what ! "
34532	34539	34540	34540	Peter	144	" Perhaps we 're too many , "
34546	34568	34540	34540	Peter	144	" But really you 'll find , after you fairly begin , that you 'll do better with four or five . "
34618	34628	34604	34604	she	1153	" Oh , I do n't care for you ! "
34914	34916	34937	34937	Her	1121	" points "
35010	35018	35005	35006	Gabriel Nash	147	" Ah la voix de CĂ limene ! "
35144	35154	35155	35155	she	1121	" Mais celles - la , c'est une plaisanterie , "
35162	35181	35155	35155	she	1121	" whereas you and your daughter , chere madame - I 'm sure you are quite another matter . "
35206	35212	35198	35199	Mrs. Rooth	178	" She knows four languages . "
35227	35244	35224	35224	her	175	" That 's three too many . The thing 's to do something proper with one . "
35245	35253	35255	35256	Mrs. Rooth	178	" We 're very much in earnest , "
35263	35288	35289	35289	she	1121	" I 'm glad to hear it - il n'y a que Ă a. La tete est bien - the head 's very good , "
35298	35315	35292	35292	she	1121	" But let us see , my dear child , what you 've got in it ! "
35351	35360	35340	35340	she	459	" Un beau regard - it carries well . "
35543	35589	35526	35527	Her mother	460	" ; she spoke as if the old actress were an army of Frenchwomen . The young heroine of the occasion quickly came round , and Madame CarrĂ , on the sofa beside her , held her hand and emitted a perfect music of reassurance . "
35624	35624	35617	35617	Voyons	202	"
35625	35631	35646	35646	she	170	" I know some pieces . "
35632	35640	35617	35617	Voyons	202	" Some pieces of the rĂ pertoire ? "
35651	35657	35646	35646	she	170	" I know some poetry . "
35658	35667	35669	35670	her mother	460	" English , French , Italian , German , "
35689	35709	35672	35673	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Does she wish to act in all those tongues ? The phrase - book is n't the comedy ! "
35710	35723	35672	35673	Madame CarrĂ	175	" It 's only to show you how she has been educated . "
35724	35761	35672	35673	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Ah , chere madame , there 's no education that matters ! I mean save the right one . Your daughter must have a particular form of speech , like me , like ces messieurs . "
35762	35771	35773	35774	the girl	481	" You see if I can speak French , "
35791	35798	35672	35673	Madame CarrĂ	175	" You speak it in perfection . "
35799	35806	35808	35809	Miss Rooth	170	" And English just as well , "
35811	35827	35672	35673	Madame CarrĂ	175	" You ought n't to be an actress - you ought to be a governess . "
35828	35843	35845	35846	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Oh do n't tell us that : it 's to escape from that ! "
35848	35860	35845	35846	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I 'm very sure your daughter will escape from that , "
35868	35876	35878	35879	the lady	5651	" Oh if you could help her ! "
35886	35898	35899	35899	Peter	144	" She has certainly all the qualities that strike the eye , "
35902	35910	35911	35912	Mrs. Rooth	178	" You 're most kind , sir ! "
35919	35933	35934	35935	Gabriel Nash	147	" She knows CĂ limene ; I 've heard her do CĂ limene , "
35940	35941	35934	35935	Gabriel Nash	147	" .
35942	35955	35957	35958	Mrs. Rooth	178	" And she knows Juliet , she knows Lady Macbeth and Cleopatra , "
35960	35981	35982	35984	the old actress	1121	" Voyons , my dear child , do you wish to work for the French stage or for the English ? "
35987	35999	36000	36000	Sherringham	144	" Ours would have sore need of you , Miss Rooth , "
36005	36020	36021	36022	her mother	460	" Could you speak to any one in London - could you introduce her ? "
36026	36043	36085	36087	the old lady	565	" Dear madam , I must hear her first , and hear what Madame CarrĂ says . "
36044	36058	36060	36061	Mrs. Rooth	178	" She has a voice of rare beauty , and I understand voices , "
36063	36075	36085	36087	the old lady	565	" Ah then if she has intelligence she has every gift . "
36076	36084	36085	36087	the old lady	565	" She has a most poetic mind , "
36091	36106	36085	36087	the old lady	565	" I should like to paint her portrait ; she 's made for that , "
36136	36184	36085	36087	the old lady	565	" So all the artists say . I 've had three or four heads of her , if you would like to see them : she has been done in several styles . If you were to do her I 'm sure it would make her celebrated . "
36185	36190	36191	36191	Nick	224	" And me too , "
36195	36205	36206	36206	Nash	147	" It would indeed - a member of Parliament ! "
36209	36219	36221	36222	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Ah , I have the honour - - ? "
36248	36265	36266	36266	she	175	" Chere madame , I can do nothing with your daughter : she knows too much ! "
36270	36284	36241	36242	Madame CarrĂ	175	" It 's a pity , because I like to catch them wild . "
36285	36311	36312	36313	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Oh she 's wild enough , if that 's all ! And that 's the very point , the question of where to try , "
36317	36339	36312	36313	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Into what do I launch her - upon what dangerous stormy sea ? I 've thought of it so anxiously . "
36340	36357	36359	36360	Gabriel Nash	147	" Try here - try the French public : they 're so much the most serious , "
36362	36377	36378	36378	Sherringham	144	" Ah no , try the English : there 's such a rare opening ! "
36384	36416	36312	36313	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Oh it is n't the public , dear gentlemen . It 's the private side , the other people - it 's the life , it 's the moral atmosphere . "
36417	36429	36430	36431	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Je ne connais qu'une scene , - la nĂ tre , "
36434	36449	36430	36431	Madame CarrĂ	175	" I 'm assured by every one who knows that there 's no other . "
36450	36455	36457	36458	Mr. Nash	147	" Very correctly assured , "
36460	36471	36457	36458	Mr. Nash	147	" The theatre in our countries is puerile and barbarous . "
36472	36492	36493	36493	Sherringham	144	" There 's something to be done for it , and perhaps mademoiselle 's the person to do it , "
36497	36511	36512	36513	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Ah but , en attendant , what can it do for her ? "
36516	36527	36529	36530	Peter Sherringham	144	" Well , anything I can help to bring about , "
36567	36582	36585	36587	the old actress	1121	" Ah , if your part 's marked out I congratulate you , mademoiselle ! "
36640	36661	36662	36663	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I feel the responsibility of what she shall find in the life , the standards , of the theatre , "
36666	36685	36686	36688	the good lady	844	" Where is the purest tone - where are the highest standards ? That 's what I ask , "
36707	36721	36722	36723	Madame CarrĂ	175	" The purest tone - qu'est - ce que c'est que Ă a ? "
36733	36741	36742	36743	Mrs. Rooth	178	" We 're very , very respectable , "
36755	36824	36742	36743	Mrs. Rooth	178	" What I want is to place my daughter where the conduct - and the picture of conduct in which she should take part - would n't be quite absolutely dreadful . Now , chere madame , how about all that ; how about conduct in the French theatre - all the things she should see , the things she should hear , the things she should learn ? "
36839	36924	36831	36831	Sherringham	144	" I do n't think I know what you 're talking about . They 're the things she may see and hear and learn everywhere ; only they 're better done , they 're better said , above all they 're better taught . The only conduct that concerns an , actress , it seems to me , is her own , and the only way for her to behave herself is not to be a helpless stick . I know no other conduct . "
36925	36948	36825	36825	Her	175	" But there are characters , there are situations , which I do n't think I should like to see her undertake . "
36949	36966	36968	36969	the Frenchwoman	1200	" There are many , no doubt , which she would do well to leave alone ! "
36971	36990	36991	36992	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I should n't like to see her represent a very bad woman - a really bad one , "
36996	37024	36825	36825	Her	175	" Ah in England then , and in your theatre , every one 's immaculately good ? Your plays must be even more ingenious than I supposed ! "
37025	37032	37034	37035	Gabriel Nash	147	" We have n't any plays , "
37037	37053	37054	37054	Sherringham	144	" People will write them for Miss Rooth - it will be a new era , "
37068	37089	37090	37092	the old lady	565	" Will you , sir - will you do something ? A sketch of one of our grand English ideals ? "
37096	37113	37114	37115	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Oh I know what you do with our pieces - to show your superior virtue ! "
37131	37156	37124	37124	he	144	" Bad women ? Je n'ai jouĂ que Ă a , madame . ' Really ' bad ? I tried to make them real ! "
37157	37165	37166	37166	Miriam	170	" I can say ' L'Aventuriere , ' "
37186	37205	37207	37208	Peter Sherringham	144	" Allow us the pleasure of hearing you then . Madame CarrĂ will give you the rĂ plique , "
37210	37224	37225	37226	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Certainly , my child ; I can say it without the book , "
37229	37241	37242	37242	She	175	" Put yourself there - move that chair a little away . "
37353	37498	37350	37350	her	1206	" You mix things up , chere madame , and I have it on my heart to tell you so . I believe it 's rather the case with you other English , and I 've never been able to learn that either your morality or your talent is the gainer by it . To be too respectable to go where things are done best is in my opinion to be very vicious indeed ; and to do them badly in order to preserve your virtue is to fall into a grossness more shocking than any other . To do them well is virtue enough , and not to make a mess of it the only respectability . That 's hard enough to merit Paradise . Everything else is base humbug ! Voila , chere madame , the answer I have for your scruples ! "
37499	37525	37526	37526	Nash	147	" It 's admirable - admirable ; and I am glad my friend Dormer here has had the great advantage of hearing you utter it ! "
37611	37627	37595	37595	he	1208	" In other words , your daughter must find her safeguard in the artistic conscience . "
37830	37843	37822	37822	her	1212	" Oh a fine artistic life - what indeed is more beautiful ? "
37892	37902	37903	37903	he	144	" I do n't know what 's in her , "
37908	37935	37903	37903	he	144	" nothing , it would seem , from her persistent vacancy . But such a face as that , such a head , is a fortune ! "
37954	37966	37936	37937	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Vous ne me fuyez pas , mon enfant , aujourd'hui . "
38045	38055	38057	38059	the old actress	1121	" Elle est bien belle - ah Ă a , "
38089	38098	38077	38077	Peter	144	" You must paint her just like that . "
38099	38103	38125	38125	her	481	" Like that ? "
38104	38110	38077	38077	Peter	144	" As the Tragic Muse . "
38261	38286	38257	38258	Madame CarrĂ	175	" I think you 've a voice , ma fille , somewhere or other . We must try and put our hand on it . "
38315	38366	38367	38368	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Mrs. Delamere in London ; she was once an ornament of the English stage . She gives lessons just to a very few ; it 's a great favour . Such a very nice person ! But above all , Signor Ruggieri - I think he taught us most . "
38402	38408	38410	38411	their hostess	1229	" Gesticulating I 'll warrant ! "
38413	38451	38410	38411	their hostess	1229	" They mimic as for the deaf , they emphasise as for the blind . Mrs. Delamere is doubtless an epitome of all the virtues , but I never heard of her . You travel too much , "
38457	38484	38452	38453	Madame CarrĂ	175	" that 's very amusing , but the way to study is to stay at home , to shut yourself up and hammer at your scales . "
38506	38550	38501	38503	the old actress	1121	" Oh you English , you 're d'une lĂ geretĂ a faire frĂ mir . If you have n't a home you must make , or at least for decency pretend to , one . In our profession it 's the first requisite . "
38551	38561	38563	38564	Mrs. Rooth	178	" But where ? That 's what I ask ! "
38566	38571	38572	38572	Sherringham	144	" Why not here ? "
38576	38580	38586	38586	her	844	" Oh here ! "
38595	38612	38613	38614	Nick Dormer	224	" Come and live in London and then I shall be able to paint your daughter , "
38617	38629	38631	38632	Gabriel Nash	147	" Is that all it will take , my dear fellow ? "
38634	38643	38644	38645	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Ah , London 's full of memories , "
38649	38669	38644	38645	Mrs. Rooth	178	" My father had a great house there - we always came up . But all that 's over . "
38670	38681	38683	38683	Peter	144	" Study here and then go to London to appear , "
38692	38698	38644	38645	Mrs. Rooth	178	" To appear in French ? "
38699	38708	38644	38645	Mrs. Rooth	178	" No , in the language of Shakespeare . "
38709	38718	38644	38645	Mrs. Rooth	178	" But we ca n't study that here . "
38719	38730	38731	38732	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Mr. Sherringham means that he will give you lessons , "
38735	38750	38731	38732	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Let me not fail to say it - he 's an excellent critic . "
38751	38766	38768	38768	Sherringham	211	" How do you know that - you who 're beyond criticism and perfect ? "
38793	38795	38806	38807	the actress	1158	" Nights "
38801	38804	38806	38807	the actress	1158	" Diable ! "
38809	38825	38806	38807	the actress	1158	" that 's more than I can ! By all means give us a specimen . "
38991	38994	38976	38976	she	170	" catch . "
39008	39017	39018	39018	She	170	" Perhaps you had better say something English . "
39062	39079	39058	39059	Mrs. Rooth	178	" She knows her Tennyson by heart . I think he 's much deeper than La Fontaine "
39090	39096	39099	39099	she	170	" The Lotus - Eaters , "
39107	39111	39099	39099	she	170	" Edward Gray . "
39164	39166	39134	39134	she	170	" affecting "
39177	39304	39134	39134	she	170	" It was all funereal , yet was artlessly rough . Sherringham thought her English performance less futile than her French , but he could see that Madame CarrĂ listened to it even with less pleasure . In the way the girl wailed forth some of her Tennysonian lines he detected a faint gleam as of something pearly in deep water . But the further she went the more violently she acted on the nerves of Mr. Gabriel Nash : that also he could discover from the way this gentleman ended by slipping discreetly to the window and leaning there with his head out and his back to the exhibition . He had the art of mute expression ; his attitude said as clearly as possible : "
39419	39419	39404	39406	these benighted women	1245	"
39521	39523	39496	39496	they	1244	" plastic "
39898	39910	39911	39911	she	175	" I do n't care a straw for your handsome girls , "
39914	39962	39911	39911	she	175	" but bring me one who 's ready to drudge the tenth part of the way Rachel drudged , and I 'll forgive her her beauty . Of course , notez bien , Rachel was n't a grosse bete : that 's a gift if you like ! "
40066	40077	40060	40060	Sherringham	211	" Well , is there anything in my young friend ? "
40078	40090	40060	40060	Sherringham	211	" Nothing I can see . She 's loud and coarse . "
40091	40104	40060	40060	Sherringham	211	" She 's very much afraid . You must allow for that . "
40105	40125	40060	40060	Sherringham	211	" Afraid of me , immensely , but not a bit afraid of her authors - nor of you ! "
40130	40144	40126	40127	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Are n't you prejudiced by what that fellow Nash has told you ? "
40145	40158	40060	40060	Sherringham	211	" Why prejudiced ? He only told me she was very handsome . "
40159	40168	40126	40127	Madame CarrĂ	175	" And do n't you think her so ? "
40169	40202	40060	40060	Sherringham	211	" Admirable . But I 'm not a photographer nor a dressmaker nor a coiffeur . I ca n't do anything with ' back hair ' nor with a mere big stare . "
40203	40210	40212	40213	Peter Sherringham	144	" The head 's very noble , "
40215	40230	40212	40213	Peter Sherringham	144	" And the voice , when she spoke English , had some sweet tones . "
40231	40284	40060	40060	Sherringham	211	" Ah your English - possibly ! All I can say is that I listened to her conscientiously , and I did n't perceive in what she did a single nuance , a single inflexion or intention . But not one , mon cher . I do n't think she 's intelligent . "
40285	40296	40212	40213	Peter Sherringham	144	" But do n't they often seem stupid at first ? "
40297	40301	40060	40060	Sherringham	211	" Say always ! "
40302	40315	40212	40213	Peter Sherringham	144	" Then do n't some succeed - even when they 're handsome ? "
40316	40331	40060	40060	Sherringham	211	" When they 're handsome they always succeed - in one way or another . "
40332	40340	40342	40343	Peter Sherringham	144	" You do n't understand us English , "
40355	40378	40352	40352	she	175	" Marry her , my son , and give her diamonds . Make her an ambassadress ; she 'll look very well . "
40379	40396	40439	40439	she	1121	" She interests you so little that you do n't care to do anything for her ? "
40397	40402	40352	40352	she	175	" To do anything ? "
40403	40411	40439	40439	she	1121	" To give her a few lessons . "
40445	40466	40439	40439	she	1121	" My dear child , I give my voice for the scene anglaise . You did the English things best . "
40467	40474	40476	40477	the girl	481	" Did I do them well ? "
40479	40512	40439	40439	she	1121	" You 've a great deal to learn ; but you 've rude force . The main things sont encore a dĂ gager , but they 'll come . You must work . "
40513	40520	40522	40523	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I think she has ideas , "
40525	40532	40533	40534	Madame CarrĂ	175	" She gets them from you , "
40537	40559	40560	40562	the good lady	844	" I must say that if it 's to be our theatre I 'm relieved . I do think ours safer , "
40565	40573	40533	40534	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Ours is dangerous , no doubt . "
40574	40582	40584	40585	the girl	481	" You mean you 're more severe , "
40587	40593	40594	40595	the actress	1158	" Your mother 's right , "
40598	40603	40594	40595	the actress	1158	" you have ideas . "
40604	40617	40618	40619	Mrs. Rooth	178	" But what shall we do then - how shall we proceed ? "
40654	40661	40663	40664	the actress	1158	" Work - work - work ! "
40666	40680	40681	40681	Miriam	170	" In English I can play Shakespeare . I want to play Shakespeare , "
40685	40702	40663	40664	the actress	1158	" That 's fortunate , as in English you have n't any one else to play . "
40703	40716	40718	40719	Mrs. Rooth	178	" But he 's so great - and he 's so pure ! "
40721	40730	40731	40732	Madame CarrĂ	175	" That indeed seems the saving of you , "
40735	40747	40748	40749	the girl	481	" You think me actually pretty bad , do n't you ? "
40756	40811	40731	40732	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Mon Dieu , que vous dirai - je ? Of course you 're rough ; but so was I at your age . And if you find your voice it may carry you far . Besides , what does it matter what I think ? How can I judge for your English public ? "
40812	40820	40822	40823	Miriam Rooth	170	" How shall I find my voice ? "
40825	40858	40731	40732	Madame CarrĂ	175	" By trying . Il n'y a que Ă a . Work like a horse , night and day . Besides , Mr. Sherringham , as he says , will help you . "
40875	40882	40869	40870	the girl	481	" Will you help me really ? "
40883	40889	40891	40892	Madame CarrĂ	175	" To find her voice , "
40894	40920	40921	40922	Gabriel Nash	147	" The voice , when it 's worth anything , comes from the heart ; so I suppose that 's where to look for it , "
40925	40936	40937	40937	Miriam	170	" Much you know ; you have n't got any ! "
40952	40959	40960	40961	Mr. Nash	147	" Any voice , my child ? "
40964	40972	40937	40937	Miriam	170	" Any heart - or any manners ! "
41049	41059	41040	41041	Mr. Nash	147	" And what impression does my young friend make ? "
41104	41106	41040	41041	Mr. Nash	147	" points "
41150	41152	41140	41140	She	1210	" taking "
41177	41180	41175	41175	her	1210	" Really ? "
41250	41277	41278	41279	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Mr. Nash has rendered us the great service of introducing us to Madame CarrĂ , and I 'm sure we 're immensely indebted to him , "
41290	41299	41300	41301	the girl	481	" But what good does that do us ? "
41319	41346	41300	41301	the girl	481	" Madame CarrĂ listens to me with adorable patience , and then sends me about my business - ah in the prettiest way in the world . "
41347	41373	41374	41375	the actress	1158	" Mademoiselle , you 're not so rough ; the tone of that 's very juste . A la bonne heure ; work - work ! "
41378	41397	41374	41375	the actress	1158	" There was an inflexion there - or very nearly . Practise it till you 've got it . "
41398	41418	41420	41421	Peter Sherringham	144	" Come and practise it to me , if your mother will be so kind as to bring you , "
41423	41433	41434	41434	Miriam	170	" Do you give lessons - do you understand ? "
41437	41456	41374	41375	the actress	1158	" I 'm an old play - goer and I 've an unbounded belief in my own judgement . "
41457	41470	41471	41472	Mrs. Rooth	178	" ' Old , ' sir , is too much to say , "
41475	41546	41471	41472	Mrs. Rooth	178	" My daughter knows your high position , but she 's very direct . You 'll always find her so . Perhaps you 'll say there are less honourable faults . We 'll come to see you with pleasure . Oh I 've been at the embassy when I was her age . Therefore why should n't she go to - day ? That was in Lord Davenant 's time . "
41547	41570	41471	41472	Mrs. Rooth	178	" A few people are coming to tea with me to - morrow . Perhaps you 'll come then at five o'clock . "
41571	41582	41584	41585	Mrs. Rooth	178	" It will remind me of the dear old times , "
41587	41601	41602	41602	Miriam	170	" Thank you ; I 'll try and do better to - morrow , "
41607	41614	41615	41615	Sherringham	144	" You do better every minute ! "
41630	41637	41638	41639	Madame CarrĂ	175	" She 's finding her voice , "
41642	41649	41650	41651	Mrs. Rooth	178	" She 's finding a friend ! "
41655	41677	41678	41679	Nick Dormer	224	" And do n't forget , when you come to London , my hope that you 'll come and see me , "
41685	41698	41678	41679	Nick Dormer	224	" To try and paint you - that would do me good ! "
41699	41706	41708	41709	Madame CarrĂ	175	" She 's finding even two , "
41711	41723	41725	41725	Miriam	170	" It 's to make up for one I 've lost ! "
41737	41747	41734	41735	Gabriel Nash	147	" It 's he who thinks I 'm bad . "
41748	41764	41765	41765	Nash	147	" You say that to make me drive you home ; you know it will , "
41768	41779	41780	41780	Sherringham	144	" We 'll all take you home ; why not ? "
41830	41835	41836	41836	she	175	" Ah la jeunesse ! "
41839	41858	41836	41836	she	175	" You 'd always have that , my child , if you were the greatest goose on earth ! "
41878	41931	41867	41867	Miriam	170	" something that it was impossible such a patron of the drama should forbear to invite her , little as the exhibition at Madame CarrĂ 's could have contributed to render the invitation prompt . His curiosity had been more appeased than stimulated , but he felt none the less that he had "
41934	41984	41867	41867	Miriam	170	" the dark - browed girl and her reminiscential mother and must face the immediate consequences of the act . This responsibility weighed upon him during the twenty - four hours that followed the ultimate dispersal of the little party at the door of the HĂ tel de la Garonne .
42201	42205	42248	42248	She	481	" remarkably well connected "
42294	42324	42277	42277	She	481	" She admired a great artist more than anything in the world ; and in the presence of art , of great art , her heart beat so fast . "
42390	42393	42379	42379	she	481	" nature . "
42476	42501	42502	42504	the poor lady	5744	" We would ask you to come up , but it 's quite at the top and we have n't a sitting - room , "
42508	42519	42502	42504	the poor lady	5744	" We had to receive Mr. Nash at a cafĂ . "
42546	42566	42530	42530	Miriam	170	" Do you wonder I should want to do something - so that we can stop living like pigs ? "
42657	42659	42663	42664	her mother	460	" meet "
43376	43393	43362	43362	she	170	" Oh thank you so much . I never saw anything so beautiful , so grand . "
43446	43495	43433	43433	Miriam	170	" I 've seen you before - two days ago at the Salon with Mr. Dormer . Yes , I know he 's your brother . I 've made his acquaintance since . He wants to paint my portrait . Do you think he 'll do it well ? "
43582	43586	43588	43588	Miriam	170	" Thank you , "
43597	43610	43588	43588	Miriam	170	" I think I had rather not passer par toute la famille ! "
43615	43632	43612	43612	she	170	" If your brother 's an artist I do n't understand how he 's in Parliament . "
43633	43649	43612	43612	she	170	" Oh he is n't in Parliament now - we only hope he will be . "
43650	43655	43612	43612	she	170	" Ah I see . "
43656	43665	43612	43612	she	170	" And he is n't an artist either , "
43674	43681	43683	43684	Miss Rooth	170	" Then he is n't anything , "
43686	43694	43612	43612	she	170	" Well - he 's immensely clever . "
43695	43700	43701	43702	Miss Rooth	170	" Ah I see , "
43706	43715	43701	43702	Miss Rooth	170	" Mr. Nash has puffed him up so . "
43716	43724	43726	43726	Biddy	134	" I do n't know Mr. Nash , "
43746	43755	43701	43702	Miss Rooth	170	" Well , you need n't wish to . "
44149	44194	44143	44143	her	491	" Ah I daresay it 's extremely fine , but I do n't care for tragedy when it treads on one 's toes . She 's like a cow who has kicked over the milking - pail . She ought to be tied up . "
44195	44213	44214	44214	Sherringham	144	" My poor Julia , it is n't extremely fine ; it is n't fine at all , "
44220	44234	44214	44214	Sherringham	144	" Pardon me then . I thought that was why you invited us . "
44235	44242	44243	44243	Peter	144	" I imagined she was different , "
44249	44278	44214	44214	Sherringham	144	" Ah if you do n't care for her so much the better . It has always seemed to me you make too awfully much of those people . "
44279	44294	44295	44296	His sister	491	" Oh I do care for her too - rather . She 's interesting . "
44308	44314	44305	44305	he	144	" And she 's dreadful . "
44709	44722	44702	44702	she	166	" It 's very awkward when people are told one 's clever . "
44723	44733	44734	44734	Gabriel	147	" It 's only awkward if one is n't , "
44737	44752	44702	44702	she	166	" Yes , but so few people are - enough to be talked about . "
44753	44776	44777	44777	he	147	" Is n't that just the reason why such a matter , such an exception , ought to be mentioned to them ? "
44780	44827	44777	44777	he	147	" They might n't find it out for themselves . Of course , however , as you say , there ought to be a certainty ; then they 're surer to know it . Dormer 's a dear fellow , but he 's rash and superficial . "
44919	44922	44877	44877	she	166	" put up "
45475	45477	45471	45471	him	1389	" kind "
45509	45511	45489	45489	he	1389	" intonations "
45648	45657	45658	45659	Mrs. Dallow	166	" I do n't know what you mean , "
45662	45671	45658	45659	Mrs. Dallow	166	" I know nothing of any such people . "
45672	45715	45602	45602	she	138	" Are n't they under your feet wherever you turn - their performances , their portraits , their speeches , their autobiographies , their names , their manners , their ugly mugs , as the people say , and their idiotic pretensions ? "
45716	45732	45735	45735	she	166	" I daresay it depends on the places one goes to . If they 're everywhere "
45740	45747	45735	45735	she	166	" I do n't go everywhere . "
45748	45781	45782	45783	Mr. Nash	147	" I do n't go anywhere , but they mount on my back at home like the Old Man of the Sea . Just observe a little when you return to London , "
45922	45926	45927	45928	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Immensely particular ? "
45931	45996	46004	46004	she	170	" Perhaps I should say rather that her mother 's so on her behalf . Particular about the sort of people they meet - the tone , the standard . I 'm bound to say they 're like you : they do n't go everywhere . That spirit 's not so common in the mob calling itself good society as not to deserve mention . "
46031	46037	46018	46018	she	170	" She 's dreadfully vulgar . "
46038	46049	46050	46051	Mr. Nash	147	" Ah do n't say that to my friend Dormer ! "
46054	46063	46064	46065	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Are you and he such great friends ? "
46072	46084	46050	46051	Mr. Nash	147	" Great enough to make me hope we shall be greater . "
46098	46111	46089	46089	she	170	" Why should n't I say to him that she 's vulgar ? "
46112	46126	46050	46051	Mr. Nash	147	" Because he admires her so much . He wants to paint her . "
46127	46132	46089	46089	she	170	" To paint her ? "
46133	46139	46050	46051	Mr. Nash	147	" To paint her portrait . "
46140	46153	46089	46089	she	170	" Oh I see . I daresay she 'd do for that . "
46160	46181	46154	46155	Mr. Nash	147	" If that 's your opinion of her you 're not very complimentary to the art he aspires to practise . "
46182	46188	46189	46189	she	170	" He aspires to practise ? "
46193	46212	46089	46089	she	170	" Have n't you talked with him about it ? Ah you must keep him up to it ! "
46241	46247	46227	46227	her	138	" Are you an artist ? "
46248	46254	46255	46255	Nash	147	" I try to be , "
46258	46267	46255	46255	Nash	147	" but I work in such difficult material . "
46296	46300	46284	46284	herself	138	" Difficult material ? "
46301	46307	46310	46310	she	138	" I work in life ! "
46543	46560	46538	46538	he	445	" I should like to see you this evening late . You must meet me somewhere . "
46561	46572	46573	46573	Nash	147	" Well take a walk - I should like that , "
46576	46601	46602	46602	He	147	" I shall smoke a cigar at the cafĂ on the corner of the Place de l'OpĂ ra - you 'll find me there . "
46688	46698	46681	46681	Grace	140	" You were talking with my cousin Mrs. Dallow . "
46699	46707	46708	46708	he	147	" To her rather than with her , "
46711	46718	46719	46719	Grace	140	" Ah she 's very charming , "
46722	46728	46681	46681	Grace	140	" She 's very beautiful . "
46729	46734	46735	46736	the girl	481	" And very clever , "
46739	46745	46746	46746	His	147	" Very , very intelligent . "
46787	46796	46797	46797	Sherringham	144	" What do you mean by my fate ? "
46800	46808	46797	46797	Sherringham	144	" You 've got them for life . "
46809	46827	46838	46839	Gabriel Nash	147	" Why for life , when I now clearly and courageously recognise that she is n't good ? "
46828	46836	46838	46839	Gabriel Nash	147	" Ah but she 'll become so , "
46841	46847	46848	46848	Sherringham	144	" Do you think that ? "
46860	46871	46872	46873	the latter	686	" You will - that 's more to the purpose ! "
46938	46952	46930	46930	her	481	" You told us she did n't know how - but she does ! "
46969	46981	46982	46982	he	144	" Ah it 's you who know how , dear Biddy ! "
47122	47158	47103	47103	she	170	" I want some more tea : will you give me some more ? I feel quite faint . You do n't seem to suspect how this sort of thing takes it out of one . "
47426	47434	47421	47421	she	170	" Confess you think me intolerably bad ! "
47435	47440	47421	47421	she	170	" Intolerably - no . "
47441	47450	47421	47421	she	170	" Only tolerably ! I find that worse . "
47451	47462	47463	47463	Sherringham	144	" Every now and then you do something very right , "
47466	47478	47421	47421	she	170	" How many such things did I do to - day ? "
47479	47495	47496	47496	She	170	" Oh three or four . I do n't know that I counted very carefully . "
47523	47533	47534	47534	she	170	" It bores you and you think it disagreeable , "
47538	47548	47534	47534	she	170	" I mean a girl always talking about herself . "
47560	47596	47557	47557	she	170	" Oh I do n't want compliments - I want the hard , the precious truth . An actress has to talk about herself . What else can she talk about , poor vain thing ? "
47597	47606	47557	47557	she	170	" She can talk sometimes about other actresses . "
47607	47626	47557	47557	she	170	" That comes to the same thing . You wo n't be serious . I 'm awfully serious . "
47652	47676	47677	47677	she	170	" If one really wants to do anything one must worry it out ; of course everything does n't come the first day , "
47681	47710	47677	47677	she	170	" I ca n't see everything at once ; but I can see a little more - step by step - as I go ; ca n't I ? "
47711	47722	47723	47723	he	144	" That 's the way - that 's the way , "
47728	47757	47723	47723	he	144	" When you see the things to do the art of doing them will come - if you hammer away . The great point 's to see them . "
47758	47772	47677	47677	she	170	" Yes ; and you do n't think me clever enough for that . "
47773	47790	47723	47723	he	144	" Why do you say so when I 've asked you to come here on purpose ? "
47791	47806	47677	47677	she	170	" You 've asked me to come , but I 've had no success . "
47807	47818	47723	47723	he	144	" On the contrary ; every one thought you wonderful . "
47819	47827	47829	47830	Miriam Rooth	170	" Oh but they do n't know ! "
47832	47881	47829	47830	Miriam Rooth	170	" You 've not said a word to me . I do n't mind your not having praised me ; that would be too banal . But if I 'm bad - and I know I 'm dreadful - I wish you 'd talk to me about it . "
47882	47891	47894	47894	himself	144	" It 's delightful to talk to you , "
47897	47908	47911	47911	she	170	" No , it is n't , but it 's kind "
47929	47941	47917	47917	Her	170	" Every now and then you ' say ' something - ! "
47956	47967	47942	47942	She	170	" I do n't want it to come by accident . "
47972	48027	47969	47969	she	170	" If there 's any good to be got from trying , from showing one 's self , how can it come unless one hears the simple truth , the truth that turns one inside out ? It 's all for that - to know what one is , if one 's a stick ! "
48028	48039	48040	48040	Sherringham	144	" You 've great courage , you 've rare qualities , "
48099	48109	48089	48089	she	170	" I will , I will , I will ! "
48110	48120	48091	48091	her	170	" You 'll do what you want , evidently . "
48121	48179	48180	48180	She	170	" I will succeed - I will be great . Of course I know too little , I 've seen too little . But I 've always liked it ; I 've never liked anything else . I used to learn things and do scenes and rant about the room when I was but five years old . "
48731	48751	48753	48754	the girl	481	" She does n't know when any thing 's right or wrong , but she 's a perfect saint , "
48761	48833	48753	48754	the girl	481	" She does n't mind when I say things over by the hour , dinning them into her ears while she sits there and reads . She 's a tremendous reader ; she 's awfully up in literature . She taught me everything herself . I mean all that sort of thing . Of course I 'm not so fond of reading ; I go in for the book of life . "
48855	48869	48870	48870	Miriam	170	" It would give on my nerves , the life I lead her , "
48873	48882	48870	48870	Miriam	170	" but she 's really a delicious woman . "
49004	49006	48965	48965	she	459	" phenomenon "
49307	49322	49323	49323	she	170	" One must let her talk , but of course it creates a prejudice , "
49346	49445	49446	49447	the girl	481	" It 's a great muddle , I know , but she ca n't bear anything coarse or nasty - and quite right too . I should n't either if I did n't have to . But I do n't care a sou where I go if I can get to act , or who they are if they 'll help me . I want to act - that 's what I want to do ; I do n't want to meddle in people 's affairs . I can look out for myself - I 'm all right ! "
49465	49479	49446	49447	the girl	481	" As for doing the bad ones I 'm not afraid of that . "
49480	49485	49446	49447	the girl	481	" The bad ones ? "
49486	49505	49446	49447	the girl	481	" The bad women in the plays - like Madame CarrĂ . I 'll do any vile creature . "
49506	49516	49446	49447	the girl	481	" I think you 'll do best what you are "
49527	49534	49519	49519	Sherringham	144	" You 're a strange girl . "
49535	49585	49586	49586	He	144	" Je crois bien ! Does n't one have to be , to want to go and exhibit one 's self to a loathsome crowd , on a platform , with trumpets and a big drum , for money - to parade one 's body and one 's soul ? "
49609	49621	49622	49622	he	144	" Give it up . You 're too good for it , "
49627	49643	49622	49622	he	144	" I doubt if you 've an idea of what girls have to go through . "
49644	49655	49656	49656	she	481	" Never , never - never till I 'm pelted ! "
49659	49675	49622	49622	he	144	" Then stay on here a bit . I 'll take you to the theatres . "
49676	49681	49682	49682	Miriam	170	" Oh you dear ! "
49713	49737	49704	49705	the girl	481	" Mamma dear , he 's the best friend we 've ever had - he 's a great deal nicer than I thought . "
49738	49745	49747	49748	Peter Sherringham	144	" So are you , mademoiselle , "
49750	49763	49764	49765	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Oh , I trust Mr. Sherringham - I trust him infinitely , "
49779	49814	49764	49765	Mrs. Rooth	178	" The kindness of every one has been beyond everything . Mr. and Mrs. Lovick ca n't say enough . They make the most obliging offers . They want you to know their brother . "
49815	49827	49828	49829	Mr. Lovick	228	" Oh I say , he 's no brother of mine , "
49835	49854	49855	49856	Mrs. Rooth	178	" They think he 'll be so suggestive , he 'll put us up to the right things , "
49860	49879	49880	49881	Mrs. Lovick	227	" It 's just a little brother of mine - such a dear , amusing , clever boy , "
49884	49899	49901	49902	her husband	5418	" Do you know she has got nine ? Upon my honour she has ! "
49904	49921	49901	49902	her husband	5418	" This one is the sixth . Fancy if I had to take them all over ! "
49922	49931	49932	49933	Mrs. Lovick	227	" Yes , it makes it rather awkward , "
49937	49954	49932	49933	Mrs. Lovick	227	" He has gone on the stage , poor darling - but he acts rather well . "
49955	49972	49973	49974	Mr. Lovick	228	" He tried for the diplomatic service , but he did n't precisely dazzle his examiners , "
49978	50001	49973	49974	Mr. Lovick	228	" Edmund 's very nasty about him . There are lots of gentlemen on the stage - he 's not the first . "
50002	50012	50014	50015	Mrs. Rooth	178	" It 's such a comfort to hear that , "
50017	50031	50032	50032	Miriam	170	" I 'm much obliged to you . Has he got a theatre ? "
50035	50049	50051	50053	the young man	445	" My dear young lady , he has n't even got an engagement , "
50062	50124	50014	50015	Mrs. Rooth	178	" He has n't been at it very long , but I 'm sure he 'll get on . He 's immensely in earnest and very good - looking . I just said that if he should come over to see us you might rather like to meet him . He might give you some tips , as my husband says . "
50125	50141	50142	50142	Miriam	170	" I do n't care for his looks , but I should like his tips , "
50146	50156	50158	50158	Sherringham	211	" And is he coming over to see you ? "
50188	50198	50186	50186	herself	178	" Not if I can help it I think ! "
50212	50225	50226	50227	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Oh sir , I 'm sure you 're fond of him , "
50238	50263	50287	50287	her	170	" No , really , I like some of the others - four or five of them ; but I do n't like Arty . "
50264	50280	50281	50281	Miriam	170	" We 'll make it up to him , then ; we 'll like him , "
50412	50496	50497	50499	The young men	651	" Come away ; I want to talk to you and I ca n't talk here . I do n't care where we go . It will be pleasant to walk ; well stroll away to the quartiers sĂ rieux . Each time I come to Paris I at the end of three days take the Boulevard , with its conventional grimace , into greater aversion . I hate even to cross it - I go half a mile round to avoid it . "
50943	50962	50963	50963	Gabriel	147	" Upon my word , my dear fellow , I do n't regard that as a fair question , "
50966	51010	50963	50963	Gabriel	147	" Besides , if you think Mrs. Dallow charming what on earth need it matter to you what I think ? The superiority of one man 's opinion over another 's is never so great as when the opinion 's about a woman . "
51011	51026	51027	51027	Nick	224	" It was to help me to find out what I think of yourself , "
51030	51198	50963	50963	Gabriel	147	" Oh , that you 'll never do . I shall bewilder you to the end . The lady with whom you were so good as to make me acquainted is a beautiful specimen of the English garden - flower , the product of high cultivation and much tending ; a tall , delicate stem with the head set upon it in a manner which , as a thing seen and remembered , should doubtless count for us as a gift of the gods . She 's the perfect type of the object raised or bred , and everything about her hangs together and conduces to the effect , from the angle of her elbow to the way she drops that vague , conventional , dry little ' Oh ! ' which dispenses with all further performance . That degree of completeness is always satisfying . But I did n't satisfy her , and she did n't understand me . I do n't think they usually understand . "
51199	51208	50963	50963	Gabriel	147	" She 's no worse than I then . "
51209	51216	50963	50963	Gabriel	147	" Ah she did n't try . "
51217	51253	50963	50963	Gabriel	147	" No , she does n't try . But she probably thought you a monster of conceit , and she would think so still more if she were to hear you talk about her trying . "
51254	51261	51263	51264	Gabriel Nash	147	" Very likely - very likely , "
51266	51295	51263	51264	Gabriel Nash	147	" I 've an idea a good many people think that . It strikes me as comic . I suppose it 's a result of my little system . "
51296	51301	50963	50963	Gabriel	147	" What little system ? "
51302	51338	51263	51264	Gabriel Nash	147	" Oh nothing more wonderful than the idea of being just the same to every one . People have so bemuddled themselves that the last thing they can conceive is that one should be simple . "
51339	51348	51349	51349	Nick	224	" Lord , do you call yourself simple ? "
51352	51404	51263	51264	Gabriel Nash	147	" Absolutely ; in the sense of having no interest of my own to push , no nostrum to advertise , no power to conciliate , no axe to grind . I 'm not a savage - ah far from it ! - but I really think I 'm perfectly independent . "
51405	51413	51414	51414	Nick	224	" Well , that 's always provoking ! "
51418	51588	51263	51264	Gabriel Nash	147	" So it would appear , to the great majority of one 's fellow - mortals ; and I well remember the pang with which I originally made that discovery . It darkened my spirit at a time when I had no thought of evil . What we like , when we 're unregenerate , is that a new - comer should give us a password , come over to our side , join our little camp or religion , get into our little boat , in short , whatever it is , and help us to row it . It 's natural enough ; we 're mostly in different tubs and cockles , paddling for life . Our opinions , our convictions and doctrines and standards , are simply the particular thing that will make the boat go - our boat , naturally , for they may very often be just the thing that will sink another . If you wo n't get in people generally hate you . "
51589	51596	51598	51598	Nick	224	" Your metaphor 's very lame , "
51600	51612	51598	51598	Nick	224	" It 's the overcrowded boat that goes to the bottom . "
51613	51752	51263	51264	Gabriel Nash	147	" Oh I 'll give it another leg or two ! Boats can be big , in the infinite of space , and a doctrine 's a raft that floats the better the more passengers it carries . A passenger jumps over from time to time , not so much from fear of sinking as from a want of interest in the course or the company . He swims , he plunges , he dives , he dips down and visits the fishes and the mermaids and the submarine caves ; he goes from craft to craft and splashes about , on his own account , in the blue , cool water . The regenerate , as I call them , are the passengers who jump over in search of better fun . I jumped over long ago . "
51753	51772	51774	51774	Nick	224	" And now of course you 're at the head of the regenerate ; for , in your turn "
51780	51790	51774	51774	Nick	224	" you all form a select school of porpoises . "
51791	51832	51263	51264	Gabriel Nash	147	" Not a bit , and I know nothing about heads - in the sense you mean . I 've grown a tail if you will ; I 'm the merman wandering free . It 's the jolliest of trades ! "
51848	51886	51840	51841	Nick Dormer	224	" I say , my dear fellow , do you mind mentioning to me whether you 're the greatest humbug and charlatan on earth , or a genuine intelligence , one that has sifted things for itself ? "
51887	51903	51904	51904	Nash	147	" I do lead your poor British wit a dance - I 'm so sorry , "
51908	51928	51904	51904	Nash	147	" But I 'm very sincere . And I have tried to straighten out things a bit for myself . "
51929	51940	51840	51841	Nick Dormer	224	" Then why do you give people such a handle ? "
51941	51946	51904	51904	Nash	147	" Such a handle ? "
51947	51962	51840	51841	Nick Dormer	224	" For thinking you 're an - for thinking you 're a mere farceur . "
51963	51981	51904	51904	Nash	147	" I daresay it 's my manner : they 're so unused to any sort of candour . "
51982	51992	51993	51993	Nick	224	" Well then why do n't you try another ? "
51996	52016	51904	51904	Nash	147	" One has the manner that one can , and mine moreover 's a part of my little system . "
52017	52037	52038	52038	Nick	224	" Ah if you make so much of your little system you 're no better than any one else , "
52045	52215	52216	52217	Gabriel Nash	147	" I do n't pretend to be better , for we 're all miserable sinners ; I only pretend to be bad in a pleasanter , brighter way - by what I can see . It 's the simplest thing in the world ; just take for granted our right to be happy and brave . What 's essentially kinder and more helpful than that , what 's more beneficent ? But the tradition of dreariness , of stodginess , of dull , dense , literal prose , has so sealed people 's eyes that they 've ended by thinking the most natural of all things the most perverse . Why so keep up the dreariness , in our poor little day ? No one can tell me why , and almost every one calls me names for simply asking the question . But I go on , for I believe one can do a little good by it . I want so much to do a little good , "
52226	52298	52216	52217	Gabriel Nash	147	" My persistence is systematic : do n't you see what I mean ? I wo n't be dreary - no , no , no ; and I wo n't recognise the necessity , or even , if there be any way out of it , the accident , of dreariness in the life that surrounds me . That 's enough to make people stare : they 're so damned stupid ! "
52299	52307	52308	52308	Nick	224	" They think you so damned impudent , "
52351	52360	52338	52338	he	224	" I do n't strike you that way ? "
52361	52383	52338	52338	he	224	" Oh ' me ! ' Was n't it just admitted that I do n't in the least make you out ? "
52384	52391	52392	52392	Nash	147	" That 's the last thing ! "
52411	52431	52432	52432	he	147	" But with a little patience we 'll clear it up together - if you care enough about it , "
52445	52767	52442	52442	he	147	" Heaven help us all , what do people mean by impudence ? There are many , I think , who do n't understand its nature or its limits ; and upon my word I 've literally seen mere quickness of intelligence or of perception , the jump of a step or two , a little whirr of the wings of talk , mistaken for it . Yes , I 've encountered men and women who thought you impudent if you were n't simply so stupid as they . The only impudence is unprovoked , or even mere dull , aggression , and I indignantly protest that I 'm never guilty of that clumsiness . Ah for what do they take one , with their beastly presumption ? Even to defend myself sometimes I 've to make believe to myself that I care . I always feel as if I did n't successfully make others think so . Perhaps they see impudence in that . But I daresay the offence is in the things that I take , as I say , for granted ; for if one tries to be pleased one passes perhaps inevitably for being pleased above all with one 's self . That 's really not my case - I find my capacity for pleasure deplorably below the mark I 've set . This is why , as I 've told you , I cultivate it , I try to bring it up . And I 'm actuated by positive benevolence ; I 've that impudent pretension . That 's what I mean by being the same to every one , by having only one manner . If one 's conscious and ingenious to that end what 's the harm - when one 's motives are so pure ? By never , never making the concession , one may end by becoming a perceptible force for good . "
52768	52781	52782	52782	Nick	224	" What concession are you talking about , in God 's name ? "
52785	52811	52442	52442	he	147	" Why , that we 're here all for dreariness . It 's impossible to grant it sometimes if you wish to deny it ever . "
52812	52849	52442	52442	he	147	" And what do you mean then by dreariness ? That 's modern slang and terribly vague . Many good things are dreary - virtue and decency and charity , and perseverance and courage and honour . "
52850	52863	52442	52442	he	147	" Say at once that life 's dreary , my dear fellow ! "
52868	52878	52442	52442	he	147	" That 's on the whole my besetting impression . "
52879	53201	52442	52442	he	147	" Cest la que je vous attends ! I 'm precisely engaged in trying what can be done in taking it the other way . It 's my little personal experiment . Life consists of the personal experiments of each of us , and the point of an experiment is that it shall succeed . What we contribute is our treatment of the material , our rendering of the text , our style . A sense of the qualities of a style is so rare that many persons should doubtless be forgiven for not being able to read , or at all events to enjoy , us ; but is that a reason for giving it up - for not being , in this other sphere , if one possibly can , an Addison , a Ruskin , a Renan ? Ah we must write our best ; it 's the great thing we can do in the world , on the right side . One has one 's form , que diable , and a mighty good thing that one has . I 'm not afraid of putting all life into mine , and without unduly squeezing it . I 'm not afraid of putting in honour and courage and charity - without spoiling them : on the contrary I shall only do them good . People may not read you at sight , may not like you , but there 's a chance they 'll come round ; and the only way to court the chance is to keep it up - always to keep it up . That 's what I do , my dear man - if you do n't think I 've perseverance . If some one 's touched here and there , if you give a little impression of truth and charm , that 's your reward ; besides of course the pleasure for yourself . "
53202	53214	53215	53215	Nick	224	" Do n't you think your style 's a trifle affected ? "
53221	53366	52442	52442	he	147	" That 's always the charge against a personal manner : if you 've any at all people think you 've too much . Perhaps , perhaps - who can say ? The lurking unexpressed is infinite , and affectation must have begun , long ago , with the first act of reflective expression - the substitution of the few placed articulate words for the cry or the thump or the hug . Of course one is n't perfect ; but that 's the delightful thing about art , that there 's always more to learn and more to do ; it grows bigger the more one uses it and meets more questions the more they come up . No doubt I 'm rough still , but I 'm in the right direction : I make it my business to testify for the fine . "
53367	53379	53381	53382	Nick Dormer	224	" Ah the fine - there it stands , over there ! "
53384	53433	53381	53382	Nick Dormer	224	" I 'm not so sure about yours - I do n't know what I 've got hold of . But Notre Dame is truth ; Notre Dame is charm ; on Notre Dame the distracted mind can rest . Come over with me and look at her ! "
53681	53699	53701	53701	Nick	224	" How it straightens things out and blows away one 's vapours - anything that 's done ! "
53711	53717	53704	53705	his companion	647	" The dear old thing ! "
53718	53744	53701	53701	Nick	224	" The great point 's to do something , instead of muddling and questioning ; and , by Jove , it makes me want to ! "
53745	53752	53753	53753	Nash	147	" Want to build a cathedral ? "
53756	53762	53701	53701	Nick	224	" Yes , just that . "
53763	53785	53701	53701	Nick	224	" It 's you who puzzle me then , my dear fellow . You ca n't build them out of words . "
53786	53795	53797	53797	Nick	224	" What is it the great poets do ? "
53799	53824	53701	53701	Nick	224	" Their words are ideas - their words are images , enchanting collocations and unforgettable signs . But the verbiage of parliamentary speeches - ! "
53825	53828	53830	53830	Nick	224	" Well , "
53838	53859	53830	53830	Nick	224	" you can rear a great structure of many things - not only of stones and timbers and painted glass . "
54045	54050	54006	54006	He	224	" Everything of that kind "
54102	54104	54132	54133	Gabriel Nash	147	" handsomeness "
54136	54141	54143	54143	he	147	" Let 's sit down "
54314	54329	54307	54307	Nash	147	" I go about my business like any good citizen - that 's all . "
54330	54337	54346	54346	Nick	224	" And what is your business ? "
54338	54345	54307	54307	Nash	147	" The spectacle of the world . "
54350	54359	54346	54346	Nick	224	" And what do you do with that ? "
54360	54377	54346	54346	Nick	224	" What does any one do with spectacles ? I look at it . I see . "
54378	54387	54346	54346	Nick	224	" You 're full of contradictions and inconsistencies , "
54392	54408	54388	54388	Nick	224	" You described yourself to me half an hour ago as an apostle of beauty . "
54409	54551	54346	54346	Nick	224	" Where 's the inconsistency ? I do it in the broad light of day , whatever I do : that 's virtually what I meant . If I look at the spectacle of the world I look in preference at what 's charming in it . Sometimes I 've to go far to find it - very likely ; but that 's just what I do . I go far - as far as my means permit me . Last year I heard of such a delightful little spot ; a place where a wild fig - tree grows in the south wall , the outer side , of an old Spanish city . I was told it was a deliciously brown corner - the sun making it warm in winter . As soon as I could I went there . "
54552	54559	54388	54388	Nick	224	" And what did you do ? "
54560	54573	54346	54346	Nick	224	" I lay on the first green grass - I liked it . "
54574	54589	54388	54388	Nick	224	" If that sort of thing 's all you accomplish you 're not encouraging . "
54590	54661	54346	54346	Nick	224	" I accomplish my happiness - it seems to me that 's something . I have feelings , I have sensations : let me tell you that 's not so common . It 's rare to have them , and if you chance to have them it 's rare not to be ashamed of them . I go after them - when I judge they wo n't hurt any one . "
54662	54674	54676	54676	Nick	224	" You 're lucky to have money for your travelling expenses , "
54678	54763	54346	54346	Nick	224	" No doubt , no doubt ; but I do it very cheap . I take my stand on my nature , on my fortunate character . I 'm not ashamed of it , I do n't think it 's so horrible , my character . But we 've so befogged and befouled the whole question of liberty , of spontaneity , of good humour and inclination and enjoyment , that there 's nothing that makes people stare so as to see one natural . "
54764	54776	54346	54346	Nick	224	" You 're always thinking too much of ' people . ' "
54777	54785	54786	54786	Gabriel	147	" They say I think too little , "
54789	54800	54802	54802	Nick	224	" Well , I 've agreed to stand for Harsh , "
54808	54820	54802	54802	Nick	224	" It 's you then who are lucky to have money . "
54821	54826	54827	54827	Nick	224	" I have n't , "
54830	54838	54827	54827	Nick	224	" My expenses are to be paid . "
54839	54850	54802	54802	Nick	224	" Then you too must think of ' people . ' "
54864	54877	54851	54851	Nick	224	" I wish very much you had more to show for it . "
54878	54884	54827	54827	Nick	224	" To show for what ? "
54885	54894	54851	54851	Nick	224	" Your little system - the asthetic life . "
54928	54949	54903	54903	he	147	" Oh having something to show 's such a poor business . It 's a kind of confession of failure . "
54950	54961	54963	54963	Nick	224	" Yes , you 're more affected than anything else , "
54966	55082	54851	54851	Nick	224	" No , my dear boy , I 'm more good - natured : do n't I prove it ? I 'm rather disappointed to find you not more accessible to esoteric doctrine . But there is , I confess , another plane of intelligence , honourable , and very honourable , in its way , from which it may legitimately appear important to have something to show . If you must confine yourself to that plane I wo n't refuse you my sympathy . After all that 's what I have to show ! But the degree of my sympathy must of course depend on the nature of the demonstration you wish to make . "
55083	55095	55096	55096	Nick	224	" You know it very well - you 've guessed it , "
55122	55142	55144	55144	Nash	147	" Ah you 've broken the scent with telling me you 're going back to the House of Commons , "
55146	55231	54851	54851	Nick	224	" No wonder you do n't make it out ! My situation 's certainly absurd enough . What I really hanker for is to be a painter ; and of portraits , on the whole , I think . That 's the abject , crude , ridiculous fact . In this out - of - the - way corner , at the dead of night , in lowered tones , I venture to disclose it to you . Is n't that the asthetic life ? "
55232	55240	55242	55242	Nash	147	" Do you know how to paint ? "
55244	55261	54851	54851	Nick	224	" Not in the least . No element of burlesque is therefore wanting to my position . "
55262	55273	54851	54851	Nick	224	" That makes no difference . I 'm so glad . "
55274	55283	54851	54851	Nick	224	" So glad I do n't know how ? "
55284	55324	54851	54851	Nick	224	" So glad of it all . Yes , that only makes it better . You 're a delightful case , and I like delightful cases . We must see it through . I rejoice I met you again . "
55325	55334	55335	55335	Nick	224	" Do you think I can do anything ? "
55338	55380	54851	54851	Nick	224	" Paint good pictures ? How can I tell without seeing some of your work ? Does n't it come back to me that at Oxford you used to sketch very prettily ? But that 's the last thing that matters . "
55381	55387	55388	55388	Nick	224	" What does matter then ? "
55397	55414	54851	54851	Nick	224	" To be on the right side - on the side of the ' fine . ' "
55415	55433	54851	54851	Nick	224	" There 'll be precious little of the ' fine ' if I produce nothing but daubs . "
55434	55479	54851	54851	Nick	224	" Ah you cling to the old false measure of success ! I must cure you of that . There 'll be the beauty of having been disinterested and independent ; of having taken the world in the free , brave , personal way . "
55480	55490	55491	55491	Nick	224	" I shall nevertheless paint decently if I can , "
55495	55514	54851	54851	Nick	224	" I 'm almost sorry ! It will make your case less clear , your example less grand . "
55515	55532	54851	54851	Nick	224	" My example will be grand enough , with the fight I shall have to make . "
55533	55540	54851	54851	Nick	224	" The fight ? With whom ? "
55541	55554	54851	54851	Nick	224	" With myself first of all . I 'm awfully against it . "
55555	55567	55568	55568	Nash	147	" Ah but you 'll have me on the other side , "
55571	55644	55568	55568	Nash	147	" Well , you 'll have more than a handful to meet - everything , every one that belongs to me , that touches me near or far ; my family , my blood , my heredity , my traditions , my promises , my circumstances , my prejudices ; my little past - such as it is ; my great future - such as it has been supposed it may be . "
55645	55656	55657	55657	Nash	147	" I see , I see . It 's splendid ! "
55660	55668	55669	55669	he	147	" And Mrs. Dallow into the bargain , "
55672	55681	55657	55657	Nash	147	" Yes , Mrs. Dallow if you like . "
55682	55690	55657	55657	Nash	147	" Are you in love with her ? "
55691	55697	55657	55657	Nash	147	" Not in the least . "
55698	55710	55657	55657	Nash	147	" Well , she is with you - so I understood . "
55711	55717	55719	55720	Nick Dormer	224	" Do n't say that , "
55725	55733	55734	55735	his companion	647	" Ah you are , you are ! "
55744	55757	55758	55758	Nick	224	" I do n't know what I am - heaven help me ! "
55774	56025	56026	56026	Nick	224	" I 'm a freak of nature and a sport of the mocking gods . Why should they go out of their way to worry me ? Why should they do everything so inconsequent , so improbable , so preposterous ? It 's the vulgarest practical joke . There has never been anything of the sort among us ; we 're all Philistines to the core , with about as much esthetic sense as that hat . It 's excellent soil - I do n't complain of it - but not a soil to grow that flower . From where the devil then has the seed been dropped ? I look back from generation to generation ; I scour our annals without finding the least little sketching grandmother , any sign of a building or versifying or collecting or even tulip - raising ancestor . They were all as blind as bats , and none the less happy for that . I 'm a wanton variation , an unaccountable monster . My dear father , rest his soul , went through life without a suspicion that there 's anything in it that ca n't be boiled into blue - books , and became in that conviction a very distinguished person . He brought me up in the same simplicity and in the hope of the same eminence . It would have been better if I had remained so . I think it 's partly your fault that I have n't , "
56030	56138	56026	56026	Nick	224	" At Oxford you were very bad company for me - my evil genius : you opened my eyes , you communicated the poison . Since then , little by little , it has been working within me ; vaguely , covertly , insensibly at first , but during the last year or two with violence , pertinacity , cruelty . I 've resorted to every antidote in life ; but it 's no use - I 'm stricken . C'est VĂ nus toute entiere a sa proie attachĂ e - putting Venus for ' art . ' It tears me to pieces as I may say . "
56139	56147	56149	56149	Nash	147	" I see , I follow you , "
56163	56174	56149	56149	Nash	147	" And that 's why you are going to stand . "
56175	56190	56026	56026	Nick	224	" Precisely - it 's an antidote . And at present you 're another . "
56191	56194	56149	56149	Nash	147	" Another ? "
56195	56225	56026	56026	Nick	224	" That 's why I jumped at you . A bigger dose of you may disagree with me to that extent that I shall either die or get better . "
56226	56233	56235	56235	Nash	147	" I shall control the dilution , "
56237	56246	56247	56247	he	147	" Poor fellow - if you 're elected ! "
56250	56305	56026	56026	Nick	224	" Poor fellow either way . You do n't know the atmosphere in which I live , the horror , the scandal my apostasy would provoke , the injury and suffering it would inflict . I believe it would really kill my mother . She thinks my father 's watching me from the skies . "
56306	56313	56314	56314	Nash	147	" Jolly to make him jump ! "
56317	56348	56026	56026	Nick	224	" He 'd jump indeed - come straight down on top of me . And then the grotesqueness of it - to begin all of a sudden at my age . "
56349	56362	56363	56363	Nash	147	" It 's perfect indeed , it 's too lovely a case , "
56366	56455	56026	56026	Nick	224	" Think how it sounds - a paragraph in the London papers : ' Mr. Nicholas Dormer , M. P. for Harsh and son of the late Right Honourable and so forth and so forth , is about to give up his seat and withdraw from public life in order to devote himself to the practice of portrait - painting - and with the more commendable perseverance by reason of all the dreadful time he has lost . Orders , in view of this , respectfully solicited . ' "
56456	56468	56470	56470	Nash	147	" The nineteenth century 's a sweeter time than I thought , "
56472	56483	56470	56470	Nash	147	" It 's the portrait then that haunts your dreams ? "
56484	56503	56026	56026	Nick	224	" I wish you could see . You must of course come immediately to my place in London . "
56504	56522	56523	56523	Gabriel	147	" Perfidious wretch , you 're capable of having talent - which of course will spoil everything ! "
56526	56549	56026	56026	Nick	224	" No , I 'm too old and was too early perverted . It 's too late to go through the mill . "
56550	56570	56026	56026	Nick	224	" You make me young ! Do n't miss your election at your peril . Think of the edification . "
56571	56576	56026	56026	Nick	224	" The edification - ? "
56577	56588	56026	56026	Nick	224	" Of your throwing it all up the next moment . "
56589	56598	56026	56026	Nick	224	" That would be pleasant for Mr. Carteret , "
56602	56607	56026	56026	Nick	224	" Mr. Carteret - ? "
56608	56624	56026	56026	Nick	224	" A dear old family friend who 'll wish to pay my agent 's bill . "
56625	56634	56026	56026	Nick	224	" Serve him right for such depraved tastes . "
56635	56641	56643	56643	Nick	224	" You do me good , "
56651	56659	56026	56026	Nick	224	" Do n't call me useless then . "
56660	56689	56690	56690	Nick	224	" Ah but not in the way you mean . It 's only if I do n't get in that I shall perhaps console myself with the brush , "
56703	56722	56026	56026	Nick	224	" For the sake of all the muses then do n't stand . For you will get in . "
56723	56734	56690	56690	Nick	224	" Very likely . At any rate I 've promised . "
56735	56742	56026	56026	Nick	224	" You 've promised Mrs. Dallow ? "
56743	56755	56756	56756	Nick	224	" It 's her place - she 'll put me in , "
56759	56770	56772	56773	Gabriel Nash	147	" Baleful woman ! But I 'll pull you out ! "
57548	57662	57545	57545	she	175	" Oh , your jeune Anglaise , I know a great deal more about her than you ! She has been back to see me twice ; she does n't go the longest way round . She charges me like a grenadier and asks me to give her - guess a little what ! - private recitations all to herself . If she does n't succeed it wo n't be for want of knowing how to thump at doors . The other day when I came in she was waiting for me ; she had been there two hours . My private recitations - have you an idea what people pay for them ? "
57663	57675	57676	57676	Sherringham	144	" Between artists , you know , there are easier conditions , "
57679	57740	57676	57676	Sherringham	144	" How do I know if she 's an artist ? She wo n't open her mouth to me ; what she wants is to make me say things to her . She does make me - I do n't know how - and she sits there gaping at me with her big eyes . They look like open pockets ! "
57741	57750	57752	57752	Sherringham	144	" I daresay she 'll profit by it , "
57754	57789	57676	57676	Sherringham	144	" I daresay you will ! Her face is stupid while she watches me , and when she has tired me out she simply walks away . However , as she comes back - ! "
57801	57808	57790	57791	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Did n't I tell you ? "
57850	57864	57865	57865	she	170	" Will you hear me to - day ? I know four things , "
57893	57907	57873	57873	she	170	" Oh how d'ye do ? I 'm very glad you 're here . "
58129	58133	58122	58131	a woman whose only being was to " make believe	6285	" make believe , "
58213	58216	58200	58227	a kind of monster in whom of necessity there would be nothing to " be fond " of , because there would be nothing to take hold of	1571	" be fond "
58953	58957	58937	58937	she	1588	" Ecoutez maintenant ! "
59132	59154	59104	59104	she	1588	" How bad you make me seem to myself and if I were you how much better I should say it ! "
59326	59337	59321	59323	the old woman	1320	" Should you like now to hear how you do ? "
59483	59503	59504	59505	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Ah my poor child , your means are all gros moyens ; you appear to have no others , "
59508	59612	59504	59505	Madame CarrĂ	175	" You do what you can , but there are people like that ; it 's the way they 're made . They can never come nearer to fine truth , to the just indication ; shades do n't exist for them , they do n't see certain differences . It was to show you a difference that I repeated that thing as you repeat it , as you represent my doing it . If you 're struck with the little the two ways have in common so much the better . But you seem to me terribly to alourdir everything you touch . "
60480	60545	60547	60549	the old woman	1320	" to pacify with compromises and superficialities , the general plea for innocence in everything and often the flagrant proof of it . In theory there was nothing he valued more than just such a logical passion as Madame CarrĂ 's , but it was apt in fact , when he found himself at close quarters with it , to appear an ado about nothing .
61005	61060	61065	61065	she	175	" Well , if she will have it she shall ; she shall know what she 's in for , what I went through , battered and broken in as we all have been - all who are worthy , who have had the honour . She shall know the real point of view . "
61187	61198	61199	61199	he	144	" And it 's understood then she may come back , "
61205	61233	61199	61199	he	144	" It 's my affair of course . You 'll take an interest in her for a month or two ; she 'll sit at your feet . "
61242	61255	61234	61236	The old actress	1121	" Oh I 'll knock her about - she seems stout enough ! "
61297	61322	61323	61323	she	170	" Objection ? I 've spent my life in cafĂ s ! They 're warm in winter and you get your lamplight for nothing , "
61326	62073	61323	61323	she	170	" Mamma and I have sat in them for hours , many a time , with a consommation of three sous , to save fire and candles at home . We 've lived in places we could n't sit in , if you want to know - where there was only really room if we were in bed . Mamma 's money 's sent out from England and sometimes it usedn't to come . Once it did n't come for months - for months and months . I do n't know how we lived . There was n't any to come ; there was n't any to get home . That is n't amusing when you 're away in a foreign town without any friends . Mamma used to borrow , but people would n't always lend . You need n't be afraid - she wo n't borrow of you . We 're rather better now - something has been done in England ; I do n't understand what . It 's only fivepence a year , but it has been settled ; it comes regularly ; it used to come only when we had written and begged and waited . But it made no difference - mamma was always up to her ears in books . They served her for food and drink . When she had nothing to eat she began a novel in ten volumes - the old - fashioned ones ; they lasted longest . She knows every cabinet de lecture in every town ; the little , cheap , shabby ones , I mean , in the back streets , where they have odd volumes and only ask a sou and the books are so old that they smell like close rooms . She takes them to the cafĂ s - the little , cheap , shabby cafĂ s too - and she reads there all the evening . That 's very well for her , but it does n't feed me . I do n't like a diet of dirty old novels . I sit there beside her with nothing to do , not even a stocking to mend ; she does n't think that comme il faut . I do n't know what the people take me for . However , we 've never been spoken to : any one can see mamma 's a great lady . As for me I daresay I might be anything dreadful . If you 're going to be an actress you must get used to being looked at . There were people in England who used to ask us to stay ; some of them were our cousins - or mamma says they were . I 've never been very clear about our cousins and I do n't think they were at all clear about us . Some of them are dead ; the others do n't ask us any more . You should hear mamma on the subject of our visits in England . It 's very convenient when your cousins are dead - that explains everything . Mamma has delightful phrases : ' My family is almost extinct . ' Then your family may have been anything you like . Ours of course was magnificent . We did stay in a place once where there was a deer - park , and also private theatricals . I played in them ; I was only fifteen years old , but I was very big and I thought I was in heaven . I 'll go anywhere you like ; you need n't be afraid ; we 've been in places ! I 've learned a great deal that way - sitting beside mamma and watching people , their faces , their types , their movements . There 's a great deal goes on in cafĂ s : people come to them to talk things over , their private affairs , their complications ; they have important meetings . Oh I 've observed scenes between men and women - very quiet , terribly quiet , but awful , pathetic , tragic ! Once I saw a woman do something that I 'm going to do some day when I 'm great - if I can get the situation . I 'll tell you what it is sometime - I 'll do it for you . Oh it is the book of life ! "
62140	62157	62124	62124	he	144	" I know what it will come to : Madame CarrĂ will want to keep me . "
62169	62174	62164	62164	she	170	" To keep you ? "
62175	62191	62192	62192	She	170	" For the French stage . She wo n't want to let you have me . "
62389	62401	62402	62402	he	144	" It 's very singular ; I know nothing like it , "
62405	62413	62402	62402	he	144	" your equal mastery of two languages . "
62414	62423	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" Say of half - a - dozen , "
62427	62554	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" Oh I do n't believe in the others to the same degree . I do n't imagine that , with all deference to your undeniable facility , you 'd be judged fit to address a German or an Italian audience in their own tongue . But you might a French , perfectly , and they 're the most particular of all ; for their idiom 's supersensitive and they 're incapable of enduring the baragouinage of foreigners , to which we listen with such complacency . In fact your French is better than your English - it 's more conventional ; there are little queernesses and impurities in your English , as if you had lived abroad too much . Ah you must work that . "
62555	62570	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" I 'll work it with you . I like the way you speak . "
62571	62585	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" You must speak beautifully ; you must do something for the standard . "
62586	62591	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" For the standard ? "
62592	62602	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" Well , there is n't any after all . "
62608	62616	62603	62603	Peter	144	" It has gone to the dogs . "
62617	62631	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" Oh I 'll bring it back . I know what you mean . "
62632	62653	62654	62654	he	144	" No one knows , no one cares ; the sense is gone - it is n't in the public , "
62684	62771	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" Purity of speech , on our stage , does n't exist . Every one speaks as he likes and audiences never notice ; it 's the last thing they think of . The place is given up to abominable dialects and individual tricks , any vulgarity flourishes , and on top of it all the Americans , with every conceivable crudity , come in to make confusion worse confounded . And when one laments it people stare ; they do n't know what one means . "
62772	62790	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" Do you mean the grand manner , certain pompous pronunciations , the style of the Kembles ? "
62791	62871	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" I mean any style that is a style , that 's a system , a consistency , an art , that contributes a positive beauty to utterance . When I pay ten shillings to hear you speak I want you to know how , que diable ! Say that to people and they 're mostly lost in stupor ; only a few , the very intelligent , exclaim : ' Then you want actors to be affected ? ' "
62872	62877	62879	62879	Miriam	170	" And do you ? "
62884	62953	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" My poor child , what else under the sun should they be ? Is n't their whole art the affectation par excellence ? The public wo n't stand that to - day , so one hears it said . If that be true it simply means that the theatre , as I care for it , that is as a personal art , is at an end . "
62954	62961	62962	62963	the girl	481	" Never , never , never ! "
62976	63072	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" I sometimes think it - that the personal art is at an end and that henceforth we shall have only the arts , capable no doubt of immense development in their way - indeed they 've already reached it - of the stage - carpenter and the costumer . In London the drama is already smothered in scenery ; the interpretation scrambles off as it can . To get the old personal impression , which used to be everything , you must go to the poor countries , and most of all to Italy . "
63073	63085	63087	63087	Miriam	170	" Oh I 've had it ; it 's very personal ! "
63090	63167	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" You 've seen the nudity of the stage , the poor , painted , tattered screen behind , and before that void the histrionic figure , doing everything it knows how , in complete possession . The personality is n't our English personality and it may not always carry us with it ; but the direction 's right , and it has the superiority that it 's a human exhibition , not a mechanical one . "
63168	63177	63178	63178	Miriam	170	" I can act just like an Italian , "
63182	63198	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" I 'd rather you acted like an Englishwoman if an Englishwoman would only act . "
63199	63207	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" Oh , I 'll show you ! "
63208	63215	63217	63217	Peter	144	" But you 're not English , "
63226	63242	62424	62424	Miriam	170	" I beg your pardon . You should hear mamma about our ' race . ' "
63243	63255	63256	63256	he	144	" You 're a Jewess - I 'm sure of that , "
63298	63322	63272	63272	she	170	" That 's always possible if one 's clever . I 'm very willing , because I want to be the English Rachel . "
63323	63343	63256	63256	he	144	" Then you must leave Madame CarrĂ as soon as you 've got from her what she can give . "
63344	63358	63359	63360	the girl	481	" Oh , you need n't fear ; you sha n't lose me , "
63367	63373	63374	63374	she	170	" My name 's Jewish , "
63378	63410	63374	63374	she	170	" but it was that of my grandmother , my father 's mother . She was a baroness in Germany . That is , she was the daughter of a baron . "
63422	63438	63419	63419	he	144	" Put all that together and it makes you very sufficiently of Rachel 's tribe . "
63439	63482	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" I do n't care if I 'm of her tribe artistically . I 'm of the family of the artists - je me fiche of any other ! I 'm in the same style as that woman - I know it . "
63483	63493	63494	63494	he	144	" You speak as if you had seen her , "
63504	63508	63501	63501	she	1651	" that woman . "
63509	63537	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" Oh I know all about her - I know all about all the great actors . But that wo n't prevent me from speaking divine English . "
63538	63553	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" You must learn lots of verse ; you must repeat it to me , "
63558	63581	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" You must break yourself in till you can say anything . You must learn passages of Milton , passages of Wordsworth . "
63582	63588	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" Did they write plays ? "
63589	63632	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" Oh it is n't only a matter of plays ! You ca n't speak a part properly till you can speak everything else , anything that comes up , especially in proportion as it 's difficult . That gives you authority . "
63633	63651	63652	63653	the girl	481	" Oh yes , I 'm going in for authority . There 's more chance in English , "
63660	63684	63685	63685	she	481	" There are not so many others - the terrible competition . There are so many here - not that I 'm afraid , "
63689	63706	63685	63685	she	481	" But we 've got America and they have n't . America 's a great place . "
63707	63738	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" You talk like a theatrical agent . They 're lucky not to have it as we have it . Some of them do go , and it ruins them . "
63739	63747	63748	63748	Miriam	170	" Why , it fills their pockets ! "
63751	63800	63748	63748	Miriam	170	" Yes , but see what they pay . It 's the death of an actor to play to big populations that do n't understand his language . It 's nothing then but the gros moyens ; all his delicacy perishes . However , they 'll understand you . "
63801	63809	63810	63810	she	170	" Perhaps I shall be too affected , "
63813	63848	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" You wo n't be more so than Garrick or Mrs. Siddons or John Kemble or Edmund Kean . They understood Edmund Kean . All reflexion is affectation , and all acting 's reflexion . "
63849	63859	63860	63860	Miriam	170	" I do n't know - mine 's instinct , "
63863	63942	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" My dear young lady , you talk of ' yours ' ; but do n't be offended if I tell you that yours does n't exist . Some day it will - if the thing comes off . Madame CarrĂ 's does , because she has reflected . The talent , the desire , the energy are an instinct ; but by the time these things become a performance they 're an instinct put in its place . "
63943	63957	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" Madame CarrĂ 's very philosophic . I shall never be like her . "
63958	63978	63554	63554	Sherringham	144	" Of course you wo n't - you 'll be original . But you 'll have your own ideas . "
63979	63990	63993	63993	she	170	" I daresay I shall have a good many of yours "
64010	64018	64019	64019	Peter	144	" Do n't go in for coquetry , "
64023	64031	64019	64019	Peter	144	" It 's a waste of time . "
64032	64039	64040	64041	the girl	481	" Well , that 's civil ! "
64044	64096	64040	64041	the girl	481	" Oh I do n't mean for me , I mean for yourself I want you to be such good faith . I 'm bound to give you stiff advice . You do n't strike me as flirtatious and that sort of thing , and it 's much in your favour . "
64097	64102	64019	64019	Peter	144	" In my favour ? "
64103	64109	64040	64041	the girl	481	" It does save time . "
64110	64128	64019	64019	Peter	144	" Perhaps it saves too much . Do n't you think the artist ought to have passions ? "
64143	64149	64150	64150	he	144	" Flirtations are not passions , "
64153	64180	64150	64150	he	144	" No , you 're simple - at least I suspect you are ; for of course with a woman one would be clever to know . "
64221	64235	64218	64218	he	144	" Be sure you do n't betray me to your friend Mr. Nash . "
64236	64248	64190	64190	he	144	" Betray you ? Do you mean about your recommending affectation ? "
64249	64272	64218	64218	he	144	" Dear me , no ; he recommends it himself . That is , he practises it , and on a scale ! "
64273	64281	64190	64190	he	144	" But he makes one hate it . "
64282	64289	64291	64291	Sherringham	144	" He proves what I mean , "
64293	64337	64291	64291	Sherringham	144	" that the great comedian 's the one who raises it to a science . If we paid ten shillings to listen to Mr. Nash we should think him very fine . But we want to know what it 's supposed to be . "
64338	64351	64352	64352	Miriam	170	" It 's too odious , the way he talks about us ! "
64356	64362	64352	64352	Miriam	170	" About ' us ' ? "
64363	64368	64398	64399	the girl	481	" Us poor actors . "
64369	64377	64378	64378	Peter	144	" It 's the competition he dislikes , "
64381	64397	64398	64399	the girl	481	" However , he 's very good - natured ; he lent mamma thirty pounds , "
64434	64443	64444	64444	she	481	" Of course he 'll get it back , "
64615	64630	64631	64631	she	170	" Well then , he wo n't - if you do n't believe it ! "
64654	64666	64667	64667	she	170	" You 're a funny man . I make you blush , "
64670	64688	64635	64635	He	528	" I must reply with the tu quoque , though I 've not that effect on you . "
64689	64695	64697	64698	the girl	481	" I do n't understand , "
64700	64708	64697	64698	the girl	481	" You 're an extraordinary young lady . "
64709	64732	64786	64786	herself	170	" You mean I 'm horrid . Well , I daresay I am . But I 'm better when you know me . "
64748	64762	64733	64733	He	528	" Your mother must repay that money . I 'll give it her . "
64763	64771	64773	64773	Miriam	170	" You had better give it him ! "
64775	64783	64784	64784	She	170	" If once mamma has it - ! "
64803	64816	64784	64784	She	170	" I suppose you 've never known any one that was poor . "
64817	64839	64842	64842	he	528	" I 'm poor myself . That is , I 'm very far from rich . But why receive favours - ? "
64900	64912	64915	64915	she	481	" Favours from Mr. Nash ? Oh he does n't count ! "
64936	64971	64915	64915	she	481	" What I meant just now was that you 're not to tell him , after all my swagger , that I consider that you and I are really required to save our theatre . "
64972	64984	64985	64985	She	481	" Oh if we can save it he shall know it ! "
65086	65131	65082	65082	he	528	" We 're very frivolous , the way we chatter . What you want to do to get your foot in the stirrup is supremely difficult . There 's everything to overcome . You 've neither an engagement nor the prospect of an engagement . "
65132	65140	65141	65141	Her	481	" Oh you 'll get me one ! "
65167	65177	65160	65160	she	481	" Why do you think I 'm so simple ? "
65178	65270	65160	65160	she	481	" I do n't then . Did n't I tell you just now that you were extraordinary ? That 's the term , moreover , that you applied to yourself when you came to see me - when you said a girl had to be a kind of monster to wish to go on the stage . It remains the right term and your simplicity does n't mitigate it . What 's rare in you is that you have - as I suspect at least - no nature of your own . "
65308	65352	65303	65303	she	170	" You 're always at concert pitch or on your horse ; there are no intervals . It 's the absence of intervals , of a fond or background , that I do n't comprehend . You 're an embroidery without a canvas . "
65353	65358	65359	65360	the girl	481	" Yes - perhaps , "
65380	65387	65370	65370	she	481	" But I 'm very honest . "
65388	65412	65370	65370	she	481	" You ca n't be everything , both a consummate actress and a flower of the field . You 've got to choose . "
65420	65431	65413	65413	She	481	" I 'm glad you think I 'm so wonderful . "
65432	65450	65451	65451	Peter	144	" Your feigning may be honest in the sense that your only feeling is your feigned one , "
65454	65481	65451	65451	Peter	144	" That 's what I mean by the absence of a ground or of intervals . It 's a kind of thing that 's a labyrinth ! "
65482	65489	65490	65490	she	481	" I know what I am , "
65504	65520	65500	65500	his	1676	" Were you really so frightened the first day you went to Madame CarrĂ 's ? "
65533	65541	65521	65521	She	481	" Do you think I was pretending ? "
65542	65564	65530	65530	her	481	" I think you always are . However , your vanity - if you had any ! - would be natural . "
65565	65582	65521	65521	She	481	" I 've plenty of that . I 'm not a bit ashamed to own it . "
65583	65624	65530	65530	her	481	" You 'd be capable of trying to ' do ' the human peacock . But excuse the audacity and the crudity of my speculations - it only proves my interest . What is it that you know you are ? "
65625	65637	65521	65521	She	481	" Why , an artist . Is n't that a canvas ? "
65638	65649	65530	65530	her	481	" Yes , an intellectual , but not a moral . "
65650	65669	65521	65521	She	481	" Ah it 's everything ! And I 'm a good girl too - wo n't that do ? "
65670	65677	65678	65678	Sherringham	144	" It remains to be seen , "
65681	65698	65678	65678	Sherringham	144	" A creature who 's absolutely all an artist - I 'm curious to see that . "
65699	65715	65521	65521	She	481	" Surely it has been seen - in lots of painters , lots of musicians . "
65716	65751	65678	65678	Sherringham	144	" Yes , but those arts are not personal like yours . I mean not so much so . There 's something left for - what shall I call it ? - for character . "
65760	65771	65752	65752	She	1678	" And do you think I have n't a character ? "
65795	65797	65792	65792	she	1678	" plastic "
65805	65814	65784	65784	He	144	" Delightful being , you 've a hundred ! "

66871	66892	66893	66893	he	144	" In the trade I follow we see things too much in the hard light of reason , of calculation , "
66901	66999	66893	66893	he	144	" but it 's good for the mind to keep up a superstition or two ; it leaves a margin - like having a second horse to your brougham for night - work . The arts , the amusements , the esthetic part of life , are night - work , if I may say so without suggesting that they 're illicit . At any rate you want your second horse - your superstition that stays at home when the sun 's high - to go your rounds with . The FranĂ ais is my second horse . "
67448	67450	67478	67478	Peter	144	" Staying "

69077	69122	69065	69065	he	144	" to him : there were times when he was mortally tired of shop - of hers . Moreover , he frankly admitted that he was tired of his own , so that the restriction was not brutal . When she replied , staring , "
69138	69146	69127	69127	you	144	" he had no rejoinder more philosophic than "
69167	69175	69157	69157	I	0	" At other times he put it : "
69212	69212	69242	69243	the girl	481	"
69213	69241	69242	69243	the girl	481	" I supposed you to feel just these questions of study , of the artistic education , as you 've called it to me , so fascinating , "
69253	69266	69267	69267	he	144	" Well , after all , I 'm not an actor myself , "
69273	69283	69284	69284	she	481	" You might be one if you were serious , "
69471	69490	69492	69501	the young man in the spirit of a high raffinĂ	1785	" That 's very well , but if I must go into details read me a little Shelley , "
69503	69526	69527	69528	the girl	481	" You 're worse than Madame CarrĂ ; you do n't know what to invent ; between you you 'll kill me ! "
69531	69583	69527	69528	the girl	481	" I think there 's a secret league between you to spoil my voice , or at least to weaken my souffle , before I get it . But a la guerre comme a la guerre ! How can I read Shelley , however , when I do n't understand him ? "
69584	69641	69642	69642	He	1787	" That 's just what I want to make you do . It 's a part of your general training . You may do without that of course - without culture and taste and perception ; but in that case you 'll be nothing but a vulgar cabotine , and nothing will be of any consequence . "
69702	69704	69652	69652	he	1787	" composing "
70033	70044	70027	70027	she	481	" I could look just like that if I tried . "

70820	70845	70816	70816	Sherringham	144	" Oh we must have a sitting - room for our studies , you know , and I 'll settle it with the landlady , "

The two ladies had only to stay in Paris , save their candle - ends and , as Madame CarrĂ had enjoined , practise their scales : there were apparently no autumn visits to English country - houses in prospect for Mrs. Rooth . Peter parted with them on the understanding that in London he would look as thoroughly as possible into the question of an engagement . The day before he began his holiday he went to see Madame CarrĂ , who said to him , "
72059	72059	71945	71945	he	144	"
72060	72068	71945	71945	he	144	" She has something then - - ? "
72069	72115	71945	71945	he	144	" She has most things . She 'll go far . It 's the first time in my life of my beginning with a mistake . But do n't tell her so . I do n't flatter her . She 'll be too puffed up . "
72116	72122	71945	71945	he	144	" Is she very conceited ? "
72126	72130	72132	72133	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Mauvais sujet ! "

73731	73742	73726	73726	she	441	" I think of Sir Nicholas and wish he were here "
73762	73767	73769	73770	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Poor Sir Nicholas ! "
73773	73780	73781	73782	Lady Agnes	132	" Did you make another speech ? "
73785	73794	73795	73795	Nick	224	" I do n't know . Did I ? "
73798	73804	73807	73807	Julia	138	" I do n't know ! "
73823	73833	73835	73836	Lady Agnes	132	" Oh of course the confusion , the bewilderment ! "
73845	73852	73853	73854	Mrs. Dallow	166	" It was really immense fun , "
73862	73866	73867	73868	Lady Agnes	132	" Dearest Julia ! "
73876	73885	73873	73873	she	132	" It was you who made it sure . "
73886	73897	73899	73899	Julia	138	" There are a lot of people coming to dinner , "
73901	73910	73911	73912	Lady Agnes	132	" Perhaps you 'll have to speak again , "
73918	73931	73933	73933	Nick	224	" Thank you ; I like the way you talk about it ! "
73935	73953	73933	73933	Nick	224	" I 'm like Iago : ' from this time forth I never will speak word ! ' "
73954	73962	73964	73965	his mother	441	" Do n't say that , Nick , "
73968	73981	73983	73983	Julia	138	" Do n't be afraid - he 'll jabber like a magpie ! "
74040	74049	74050	74050	she	132	" I hope you 've thanked Julia handsomely , "
74054	74061	74011	74012	Lady Agnes	132	" Why of course , mother . "
74062	74076	74118	74119	Lady Agnes	132	" She has done as much as if you had n't been sure . "
74077	74092	74011	74012	Lady Agnes	132	" I was n't in the least sure - and she has done everything . "
74093	74117	74118	74119	Lady Agnes	132	" She has been too good - but we ' ve done something . I hope you do n't leave out your father , "
74132	74135	74011	74012	Lady Agnes	132	" we . "
74136	74141	74142	74142	Nick	224	" Never , never ! "
74175	74196	74155	74155	he	224	" Of course his name has worked for me . Gone as he is he 's still a living force . "
74228	74242	74243	74244	Lady Agnes	132	" He hears you , he watches you , he rejoices in you , "
74292	74300	74288	74288	he	224	" Julia 's a tremendously effective woman . "
74301	74307	74309	74310	Lady Agnes	132	" Of course she is ! "
74313	74321	74329	74329	he	224	" Her charming appearance is half the battle "
74355	74369	74345	74346	his companion	647	" A woman 's always effective when she likes a person so much . "
74396	74403	74391	74391	he	224	" When are you going away ? "
74404	74424	74448	74448	Nick	224	" The first moment that 's civil - to - morrow morning . You 'll stay on I hope . "
74425	74436	74391	74391	he	224	" Stay on ? What shall I stay on for ? "
74437	74447	74448	74448	Nick	224	" Why you might stay to express your appreciation . "
74451	74458	74448	74448	Nick	224	" I 've everything to do . "
74459	74466	74468	74469	Lady Agnes	132	" I thought everything was done , "
74471	74479	74480	74481	her son	452	" Well , that 's just why , "
74488	74509	74511	74511	he	452	" I want to do other things - quite other things . I should like to take the next train , "
74517	74529	74448	74448	Nick	224	" When there are people coming to dinner to meet you ? "
74530	74540	74551	74552	Lady Agnes	132	" They 'll meet you - that 's better . "
74541	74550	74551	74552	Lady Agnes	132	" I 'm sorry any one 's coming , "
74567	74601	74551	74552	Lady Agnes	132	" I wish we were alone - just as a family . It would please Julia to - day to feel that we are one . Do stay with her to - morrow . "
74602	74613	74551	74552	Lady Agnes	132	" How will that do - when she 's alone ? "
74614	74625	74551	74552	Lady Agnes	132	" She wo n't be alone , with Mrs. Gresham . "
74626	74633	74551	74552	Lady Agnes	132	" Mrs. Gresham does n't count . "
74634	74675	74551	74552	Lady Agnes	132	" That 's precisely why I want you to stop . And her cousin , almost her brother : what an idea that it wo n't do ! Have n't you stayed here before when there has been no one ? "
74676	74698	74551	74552	Lady Agnes	132	" I 've never stayed much , and there have always been people . At any rate it 's now different . "
74699	74719	74721	74722	Lady Agnes	132	" It 's just because it 's different . Besides , it is n't different and it never was , "
74738	74758	74721	74722	Lady Agnes	132	" She always liked you and she likes you now more than ever - if you call that different ! "
74921	74981	74915	74916	his mother	441	" What could be more natural than that after your triumphant contest you and she should have lots to settle and to talk about - no end of practical questions , no end of urgent business ? Are n't you her member , and ca n't her member pass a day with her , and she a great proprietor ? "
74992	75000	74982	74982	Nick	224	" Her member - am I hers ? "
75015	75030	75031	75031	she	132	" Well , if the place is hers and you represent the place - ! "
75049	75131	75041	75041	Nick	224	" What a droll thing to ' represent , ' when one thinks of it ! And what does it represent , poor stupid little borough with its strong , though I admit clean , smell of meal and its curiously fat - faced inhabitants ? Did you ever see such a collection of fat faces turned up at the hustings ? They looked like an enormous sofa , with the cheeks for the gathers and the eyes for the buttons . "
75132	75146	75147	75148	Lady Agnes	132	" Oh well , the next time you shall have a great town , "
75159	75175	75176	75176	Nick	224	" It will only be a bigger sofa ! I 'm joking , of course ? "
75179	75226	75176	75176	Nick	224	" and I ought to be ashamed of myself . They 've done me the honour to elect me and I shall never say a word that 's not civil about them , poor dears . But even a new member may blaspheme to his mother . "
75227	75237	75240	75240	she	132	" I wish you 'd be serious to your mother "
75245	75264	75265	75265	Nick	224	" The difficulty is that I 'm two men ; it 's the strangest thing that ever was , "
75274	75328	75265	75265	Nick	224	" I 'm two quite distinct human beings , who have scarcely a point in common ; not even the memory , on the part of one , of the achievements or the adventures of the other . One man wins the seat but it 's the other fellow who sits in it . "
75329	75342	75343	75343	she	132	" Oh Nick , do n't spoil your victory by your perversity ! "
75353	75400	75346	75346	she	132	" I went through it with great glee - I wo n't deny that : it excited me , interested me , amused me . When once I was in it I liked it . But now that I 'm out of it again - - ! "
75401	75406	75407	75408	His mother	441	" Out of it ? "
75411	75422	75407	75408	His mother	441	" Is n't the whole point that you 're in ? "
75423	75435	75346	75346	she	132	" Ah now I 'm only in the House of Commons . "
75460	75463	75439	75439	she	132	" Hush ! "
75475	75478	75439	75439	she	132	" only . "
75498	75513	75493	75493	she	132	" You 'll be in the Lords the day you determine to get there . "
75558	75720	75555	75555	he	224	" The odd thing is , you know , that Harsh has no wants . At least it 's not sharply , not articulately conscious of them . We all pretended to talk them over together , and I promised to carry them in my heart of hearts . But upon my honour I ca n't remember one of them . Julia says the wants of Harsh are simply the national wants - rather a pretty phrase for Julia . She means she does everything for the place ; she 's really their member and this house in which we stand their legislative chamber . Therefore the lacunae I 've undertaken to fill out are the national wants . It will be rather a job to rectify some of them , wo n't it ? I do n't represent the appetites of Harsh - Harsh is gorged . I represent the ideas of my party . That 's what Julia says . "
75721	75729	75730	75731	Lady Agnes	132	" Oh never mind what Julia says ! "
75751	75772	75773	75773	she	132	" My dearest son , I wish to heaven you 'd marry her . It would be so fitting now ! "
75776	75780	75781	75781	Nick	224	" Why now ? "
75784	75795	75730	75731	Lady Agnes	132	" She has shown you such sympathy , such devotion . "
75796	75806	75730	75731	Lady Agnes	132	" Is it for that she has shown it ? "
75807	75819	75821	75822	Lady Agnes	132	" Ah you might feel - I ca n't tell you ! "
75840	75850	75825	75825	He	224	" Must I marry her because you like her ? "
75851	75867	75730	75731	Lady Agnes	132	" I ? Why we 're all as fond of her as we can be . "
75868	75928	75825	75825	He	224	" Dear mother , I hope that any woman I ever may marry will be a person agreeable not only to you , but also , since you make a point of it , to Grace and Biddy . But I must tell you this - that I shall marry no woman I 'm not unmistakably in love with . "
75929	75949	75950	75951	Lady Agnes	132	" And why are you not in love with Julia - charming , clever , generous as she is ? "
75963	75992	75958	75958	she	132	" Dearest Nick , if you care anything in the world to make me happy you 'll stay over here to - morrow and be nice to her . "
75998	76006	75993	75993	He	1906	" Do you mean propose to her ? "
76007	76026	76029	76029	she	132	" With a single word , with the glance of an eye , the movement of your little finger "
76041	76062	76029	76029	she	132	" in less time than it takes me to say what I say now , you may have it all . "
76078	76092	76074	76074	she	132	" You know she 's a fine creature - you know she is ! "
76093	76123	76074	76074	she	132	" Dearest mother , what I seem to know better than anything else in the world is that I love my freedom . I set it far above everything . "
76124	76136	76137	76138	Lady Agnes	132	" Your freedom ? What freedom is there in being poor ? "
76142	76156	76137	76138	Lady Agnes	132	" Talk of that when Julia puts everything she possesses at your feet ! "
76157	76203	76074	76074	she	132	" I ca n't talk of it , mother - it 's too terrible an idea . And I ca n't talk of her , nor of what I think of her . You must leave that to me . I do her perfect justice . "
76204	76217	76218	76218	she	132	" You do n't or you 'd marry her to - morrow , "
76222	76365	76218	76218	she	132	" You 'd feel the opportunity so beautifully rare , with everything in the world to make it perfect . Your father would have valued it for you beyond everything . Think a little what would have given him pleasure . That 's what I meant when I spoke just now of us all . It was n't of Grace and Biddy I was thinking - fancy ! - it was of him . He 's with you always ; he takes with you , at your side , every step you take yourself . He 'd bless devoutly your marriage to Julia ; he 'd feel what it would be for you and for us all . I ask for no sacrifice and he 'd ask for none . We only ask that you do n't commit the crime - - ! "
76376	76383	76374	76374	he	224	" Mother , mother , mother ! "
76416	76439	76440	76440	He	224	" You know it - you know it perfectly . All and more than all that I can tell you you know . "
76499	76635	76492	76492	she	1907	" For a public man she 'd be the perfect companion . She 's made for public life - she 's made to shine , to be concerned in great things , to occupy a high position and to help him on . She 'd back you up in everything as she has backed you in this . Together there 's nothing you could n't do . You can have the first house in England - yes , the very first ! What freedom is there in being poor ? How can you do anything without money , and what money can you make for yourself - what money will ever come to you ? That 's the crime - to throw away such an instrument of power , such a blessed instrument of good . "
76636	76647	76649	76649	Nick	224	" It is n't everything to be rich , mother , "
76673	76684	76667	76667	his	224	" And it is n't so fearful to be poor . "
76685	76699	76730	76730	his	224	" It 's vile - it 's abject . Do n't I know ? "
76700	76708	76709	76709	he	224	" Are you in such acute want ? "
76712	76729	76744	76744	her	441	" Ah do n't make me explain what you 've only to look at to see ! "
76747	76750	76751	76751	he	224	" Besides , "
76756	76776	76751	76751	he	224	" there 's other money in the world than Julia 's . I might come by some of that . "
76777	76785	76792	76792	her	441	" Do you mean Mr. Carteret 's ? "
76827	76928	76929	76929	she	1911	" Let me tell you one thing , for I 've known Charles Carteret much longer than you and I understand him better . There 's nothing you could do that would do you more good with him than to marry Julia . I know the way he looks at things and I know exactly how that would strike him . It would please him , it would charm him ; it would be the thing that would most prove to him that you 're in earnest . You need , you know , to do something of that sort , "
76936	76945	76947	76947	Nick	224	" Have n't I come in for Harsh ? "
76949	77003	76929	76929	she	1911	" Oh he 's very canny . He likes to see people rich . Then he believes in them - then he 's likely to believe more . He 's kind to you because you 're your father 's son ; but I 'm sure your being poor takes just so much off . "
77004	77012	77014	77014	Nick	224	" He can remedy that so easily , "
77019	77036	77014	77014	Nick	224	" Is my being kept by Julia what you call my making an effort for myself ? "
77042	77049	77050	77050	she	132	" You need n't insult Julia ! "
77053	77067	77068	77068	Nick	224	" Moreover , if I 've her money I sha n't want his , "
77084	77095	77081	77081	she	441	" And pray would n't you wish to be independent ? "
77096	77163	77081	77081	she	441	" You 're delightful , dear mother - you 're very delightful ! I particularly like your conception of independence . Does n't it occur to you that at a pinch I might improve my fortune by some other means than by making a mercenary marriage or by currying favour with a rich old gentleman ? Does n't it occur to you that I might work ? "
77164	77177	77081	77081	she	441	" Work at politics ? How does that make money , honourably ? "
77178	77186	77081	77081	she	441	" I do n't mean at politics . "
77187	77194	77197	77197	she	441	" What do you mean then ? "
77229	77236	77226	77226	she	441	" Are you elected or not ? "
77237	77243	77244	77244	he	224	" It seems a dream , "
77249	77271	77272	77272	She	441	" If you are , act accordingly and do n't mix up things that are as wide asunder as the poles ! "
77491	77523	77524	77524	She	441	" Do n't you see how things have turned out for us ? Do n't you know how unhappy I am , do n't you know what a bitterness - - ? "
77556	77690	77530	77530	her	441	" You know what Percival is and the comfort I have of him . You know the property and what he 's doing with it and what comfort I get from that ! Everything 's dreary but what you can do for us . Everything 's odious , down to living in a hole with one 's girls who do n't marry . Grace is impossible - I do n't know what 's the matter with her ; no one will look at her , and she 's so conceited with it - sometimes I feel as if I could beat her ! And Biddy will never marry , and we 're three dismal women in a filthy house , and what are three dismal women , more or less , in London ? "
78095	78101	78102	78102	she	441	" The first house in England "
78225	78236	78219	78219	she	132	" Do n't desert us - do n't desert us . "
78237	78245	78219	78219	she	132	" Do n't desert you - - ? "
78246	78279	78219	78219	she	132	" Be great - be great . I 'm old , I 've lived , I 've seen . Go in for a great material position . That will simplify everything else . "
78280	78303	78304	78304	Nick	224	" I 'll do what I can for you - anything , everything I can . Trust me - leave me alone , "
78308	78323	78219	78219	she	132	" And you 'll stay over - you 'll spend the day with her ? "
78324	78334	78219	78219	she	132	" I 'll stay till she turns me out ! "
78355	78364	78345	78345	she	441	" My dearest son , my only joy ! "
78367	78378	78379	78379	she	441	" I do n't see how you can resist her , "
78382	78388	78335	78336	His mother	441	" No more do I ! "
78406	78450	78389	78389	She	441	" If you 're so fond of art , what art is equal to all this ? The joy of living in the midst of it - of seeing the finest works every day ! You 'll have everything the world can give . "
78451	78469	78470	78470	Nick	224	" That 's exactly what was just passing in my own mind . It 's too much , "
78473	78479	78389	78389	She	441	" Do n't be selfish ! "
78480	78483	78484	78484	he	224	" Selfish ? "
78487	78498	78389	78389	She	441	" Unselfish then . You 'll share it with us . "
78499	78509	78510	78510	he	224	" And with Julia a little , I hope , "
78513	78518	78520	78521	his mother	441	" God bless you ! "
78558	78574	78554	78554	he	224	" Why do you talk so of poor Biddy ? Why wo n't she marry ? "
78575	78583	78585	78586	Lady Agnes	132	" You had better ask Peter Sherringham , "
78588	78597	78554	78554	he	224	" What has he to do with it ? "
78598	78626	78554	78554	he	224	" How odd of you not to know - when it 's so plain how she thinks of him that it 's a matter of common gossip . "
78627	78653	78554	78554	he	224	" Yes , if you will - we 've made it so , and she takes it as an angel . But Peter likes her . "
78654	78689	78691	78692	Lady Agnes	132	" Does he ? Then it 's the more shame to him to behave as he does . He had better leave his wretched actresses alone . That 's the love of art too ! "
78701	78714	78695	78695	Nick	224	" Biddy 's so charming she 'll easily marry some one else . "
78715	78736	78737	78738	his mother	441	" Never , if she loves him . However , Julia will bring it about - Julia will help her , "
78743	78759	78737	78738	his mother	441	" That 's what you 'll do for us - that she 'll do everything ! "
78760	78767	78768	78768	he	224	" Why then more than now ? "
78771	78778	78737	78738	his mother	441	" Because we shall be yours . "
78779	78785	78737	78738	his mother	441	" You 're mine already . "
78786	78801	78802	78803	Lady Agnes	132	" Yes , but she is n't . However , she 's as good ! "
78806	78816	78818	78818	Nick	224	" She 'll turn me out of the house , "
78820	78838	78840	78840	she	132	" Come and tell me when she does ! But there she is - go to her ! "
78875	78880	78871	78871	her	1229	" Go to her , "
78892	78892	78886	78886	she	1229	"
78931	78948	78949	78950	Lady Agnes	132	" We go home to - morrow , but Nick will stay a day or two , "
78955	78960	78961	78961	Grace	140	" Dear old Nick ! "
78969	78976	78977	78977	she	140	" He 's going to speak , "
78981	78988	78977	78977	she	140	" But do n't mention it . "
78989	78995	78996	78996	Biddy	134	" Do n't mention it ? "
79003	79013	78996	78996	Biddy	134	" Has n't he spoken enough , poor fellow ? "
79014	79020	79021	79022	Lady Agnes	132	" I mean to Julia , "
79025	79034	79037	79037	Grace	140	" Do n't you understand , you goose ? "

79424	79435	79418	79419	Mrs. Gresham	262	" And of course you hate me for being here . "
79444	79466	79441	79441	she	262	" But I 'm almost part of the house , you know - I 'm one of the chairs or tables . "
79485	79518	79481	79482	Mrs. Gresham	262	" I believe there are to be some people to dinner ; rather an interference , is n't it ? Julia lives so in public . But it 's all for you . "
79526	79533	79523	79523	she	262	" It 's a wonderful constitution . "
79587	79593	79579	79579	He	224	" The British ? Wonderful ! "
79614	79631	79608	79609	Mrs. Dallow	166	" The surface so delicate , the action so easy , yet the frame of steel . "
79708	79899	79702	79702	she	262	" by her friends , who in no event sent for Mr. Gresham . She came in every case , with her air of being rĂ pandue at the expense of dingier belongings . Her figure was admired - that is it was sometimes mentioned - and she dressed as if it was expected of her to be smart , like a young woman in a shop or a servant much in view . She slipped in and out , accompanied at the piano , talked to the neglected visitors , walked in the rain , and after the arrival of the post usually had conferences with her hostess , during which she stroked her chin and looked familiarly responsible . It was her peculiarity that people were always saying things to her in a lowered voice . She had all sorts of acquaintances and in small establishments sometimes wrote the menus . Great ones , on the other hand , had no terrors for her - she had seen too many . No one had ever discovered whether any one else paid her . People only knew what they did .

The embarrassment , that is the revival of scepticism , which might produce an inconsistency shameful to exhibit and yet difficult to conceal , was safe enough to come later . Indeed at the risk of presenting our young man as too whimsical a personage I may hint that some such sickly glow had even now begun to tinge one quarter of his inward horizon .

83641	83660	83686	83686	she	138	" I believe there are three or four , but I 'll put them off if you like . "
83661	83671	83672	83672	he	224	" Must you always live in public , Julia ? "
83689	83701	83675	83675	She	138	" We 'll go home - I 'll put them off . "
83702	83728	83686	83686	she	138	" Ah no , do n't go home ; it 's too jolly here . Let them come , let them come , poor wretches ! "
83729	83736	83737	83737	Julia	138	" How little you know me , "
83742	83760	83737	83737	Julia	138	" when , ever so many times , I 've lived here for months without a creature ! "
83761	83769	83686	83686	she	138	" Except Mrs. Gresham , I suppose . "
83770	83783	83737	83737	Julia	138	" I have had to have the house going , I admit . "
83784	83800	83686	83686	she	138	" You 're perfect , you 're admirable , and I do n't criticise you . "
83801	83808	83809	83809	she	138	" I do n't understand you ! "
83813	83828	83829	83829	Nick	224	" That only adds to the generosity of what you 've done for me , "
83909	83917	83897	83897	he	224	" Sha n't we visit the ruin ? "
83918	83933	83897	83897	he	224	" If you like . I do n't mind seeing how they keep it . "
83971	83979	83980	83980	Nick	224	" They keep the place very well , "
83986	83998	83980	83980	Nick	224	" It 's a capital place to give up everything in . "
83999	84013	84015	84015	Julia	138	" It might do at least for you to explain what you mean . "
84019	84054	84015	84015	Julia	138	" I mean to pretend for half an hour that I do n't represent the burgesses of Harsh . It 's charming - it 's very delicate work . Surely it has been retouched . "
84162	84174	84157	84157	her	2073	" You ought to read Mr. Hoppus 's article to me . "
84175	84183	84184	84184	Nick	224	" Why , is this your salon ? "
84187	84205	84157	84157	her	2073	" What makes you always talk of that ? My salon 's an invention of your own . "
84206	84219	84157	84157	her	2073	" But is n't it the idea you 're most working for ? "
84244	84266	84224	84224	she	2073	" How much you know me ! I 'm not ' working ' for anything - that you 'll ever guess . "
84296	84310	84267	84267	Nick	224	" They do keep it very well . You 've got charming things . "
84311	84325	84410	84410	He	224	" They 're supposed to come over every day and look after them . "
84326	84334	84267	84267	Nick	224	" They must come over in force . "
84335	84341	84410	84410	He	224	" Oh no one knows . "
84342	84356	84267	84267	Nick	224	" It 's spick and span . How well you have everything done ! "
84357	84368	84370	84371	Mrs. Dallow	166	" I think you 've some reason to say so , "
84386	84409	84410	84410	He	224	" But you 're right about my not knowing you . Why were you so ready to do so much for me ? "
84436	84444	84432	84432	she	2073	" Why do you hate me so ? "
84445	84454	84455	84455	Nick	224	" Was it because you like me personally ? "
84465	84489	84459	84459	he	224	" You may think that an odd or positively an odious question ; but is n't it natural , my wanting to know ? "
84490	84498	84499	84499	Julia	138	" Oh if you do n't know ! "
84504	84513	84459	84459	he	224	" It 's a question of being sure . "
84514	84525	84499	84499	Julia	138	" Well then if you 're not sure - - ! "
84526	84540	84459	84459	he	224	" Was it done for me as a friend , as a man ? "
84541	84553	84499	84499	Julia	138	" You 're not a man - you 're a child , "
84573	84582	84583	84583	Nick	224	" After all I was a good candidate , "
84587	84595	84459	84459	he	224	" What do I care for candidates ? "
84596	84606	84607	84607	he	224	" You 're the most delightful woman , Julia , "
84616	84630	84607	84607	he	224	" and I ca n't imagine what you mean by my hating you . "
84631	84647	84656	84656	She	2045	" If you have n't discovered that I like you , you might as well . "
84648	84655	84607	84607	he	224	" Might as well discover it ? "
84705	84713	84714	84714	she	2045	" Might as well have hated me , "
84717	84742	84743	84743	he	224	" We 've got on so beautifully together all these days : why should n't we get on as well for ever and ever ? "
84757	84797	84798	84798	he	224	" Ah Julia , I do n't know what you 've done to me , but you 've done it . You 've done it by strange ways , but it will serve . Yes , I hate you , "
84811	84820	84821	84821	she	2045	" Dear Nick , dear Nick - - ! "
84866	84878	84862	84862	him	224	" Why should n't it be for ever , for ever ? "
84894	84905	84906	84906	Nick	224	" You 've done it , you 've done it , "
84909	84917	84918	84918	she	2045	" What do you want of me ? "
84921	84932	84862	84862	him	224	" To stay with me - this way - always . "
84933	84939	84940	84940	she	2045	" Ah not this way , "
84963	84971	84972	84972	He	224	" This way then - or this ! "
85011	85031	85032	85032	He	224	" If you 'll marry me , why should n't it be so simple , so right and good ? "
85065	85075	85076	85076	she	2045	" You 're hard , and it 's cruel ! "
85084	85089	85076	85076	she	2045	" Hard - cruel ? "
85090	85098	85105	85105	Nick	224	" You do it with so little ! "
85155	85169	85139	85139	he	224	" So little ? It 's with everything - with everything I have . "
85170	85187	85188	85188	Her	138	" I 've done it , you say ? What do you accuse me of doing ? "
85194	85227	85228	85228	he	224	" Of making me yours ; of being so precious , Julia , so exactly what a man wants , as it seems to me . I did n't know you could , "
85237	85248	85228	85228	he	224	" I did n't - no , I did n't . "
85249	85263	85188	85188	Her	138	" It 's what I say - that you 've always hated me . "
85264	85273	85274	85274	he	224	" I 'll make it up to you ! "
85289	85297	85277	85277	She	138	" You do n't even deny it . "
85298	85320	85188	85188	Her	138	" Contradict you now ? I 'll admit it , though it 's rubbish , on purpose to live it down . "
85321	85327	85328	85328	she	138	" It does n't matter , "
85332	85357	85328	85328	she	138	" for however much you might have liked me you 'd never have done so half as much as I 've cared for you . "
85358	85365	85366	85366	Nick	224	" Oh I 'm so poor ! "
85391	85399	85388	85388	she	138	" You never can live it down . "
85400	85421	85388	85388	she	138	" I like that ! Have n't I asked you to marry me ? When did you ever ask me ? "
85422	85442	85388	85388	she	138	" Every day of my life ! As I say , it 's hard - for a proud woman . "
85443	85455	85388	85388	she	138	" Yes , you 're too proud even to answer me . "
85456	85469	85388	85388	she	138	" We must think of it , we must talk of it . "
85470	85484	85388	85388	she	138	" Think of it ? I 've thought of it ever so much . "
85485	85499	85388	85388	she	138	" I mean together . There are many things in such a question . "
85500	85512	85388	85388	she	138	" The principal thing is beautifully to give me your word . "
85526	85535	85522	85522	she	138	" I wish I did n't adore you ! "
85543	85578	85522	85522	she	138	" You do n't adore me at all , you know , if you leave me now . Why do you go ? It 's so charming here and we 're so delightfully alone . "
85579	85591	85592	85592	Julia	138	" Untie the boat ; we 'll go on the water , "
85609	85618	85619	85619	he	224	" Ah stay a little - do stay ! "
85622	85634	85635	85635	she	138	" I 'll get in myself , I 'll pull off , "
86124	86138	86139	86139	she	138	" You 've got to be a very great man , you know , "
86150	86167	86139	86139	she	138	" I do n't know what you mean about my salon , but I am ambitious . "
86168	86181	86182	86182	he	224	" We must look at life in a large , bold way , "
86190	86211	86139	86139	she	138	" That 's what I mean . If I did n't think you could I would n't look at you . "
86212	86217	86139	86139	she	138	" I could what ? "
86218	86288	86139	86139	she	138	" Do everything you ought - everything I imagine , I dream of . You are clever : you can never make me believe the contrary after your speech on Tuesday , Do n't speak to me ! I 've seen , I 've heard , and I know what 's in you . I shall hold you to it . You 're everything you pretend not to be . "
86298	86306	86307	86307	he	224	" Will it always be so amusing ? "
86310	86316	86139	86139	she	138	" Will what always be ? "
86317	86322	86139	86139	she	138	" Why my career . "
86323	86331	86139	86139	she	138	" Sha n't I make it so ? "
86332	86345	86347	86347	Nick	224	" Then it will be yours - it wo n't be mine , "
86349	86378	86139	86139	she	138	" Ah do n't say that - do n't make me out that sort of woman ! If they should say it 's me I 'd drown myself . "
86379	86388	86139	86139	she	138	" If they should say what 's you ? "
86389	86418	86139	86139	she	138	" Why your getting on . If they should say I push you and do things for you . Things I mean that you ca n't do yourself . "
86419	86436	86139	86139	she	138	" Well , wo n't you do them ? It 's just what I count on . "
86437	86443	86444	86444	Julia	138	" Do n't be dreadful , "
86447	86471	86444	86444	Julia	138	" It would be loathsome if I were thought the cleverest . That 's not the sort of man I want to marry . "
86472	86483	86139	86139	she	138	" Oh I shall make you work , my dear ! "
86484	86490	86491	86491	she	138	" Ah that - - ! "
86506	86523	86524	86524	Nick	224	" You 'll do the great thing , you 'll make my life the best life , "
86537	86547	86529	86529	he	224	" I daresay that will keep me in heart . "
86548	86560	86562	86562	her	138	" In heart ? Why should n't you be in heart ? "
86582	86590	86591	86591	he	224	" Oh it will be all right ! "
86595	86618	86562	86562	her	138	" You 'll like success as well as any one else . Do n't tell me - you 're not so ethereal ! "
86619	86627	86562	86562	her	138	" Yes , I shall like success . "
86628	86648	86649	86649	Julia	138	" So shall I ! And of course I 'm glad you 'll now be able to do things , "
86653	86670	86649	86649	Julia	138	" I 'm glad you 'll have things . I 'm glad I 'm not poor . "
86671	86679	86680	86680	Nick	224	" Ah do n't speak of that , "
86683	86698	86680	86680	Nick	224	" Only be nice to my mother . We shall make her supremely happy . "
86699	86721	86722	86723	Mrs. Dallow	166	" It would n't be for your mother I 'd do it - yet I 'm glad I like your people , "
86726	86732	86722	86723	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Leave them to me ! "
86733	86742	86743	86743	he	224	" You 're generous - you 're noble , "
86746	86768	86722	86723	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Your mother must live at Broadwood ; she must have it for life . It 's not at all bad . "
86769	86773	86774	86775	her companion	505	" Ah Julia , "
86778	86786	86774	86775	her companion	505	" it 's well I love you ! "
86787	86793	86794	86794	she	166	" Why should n't you ? "
86903	86915	86885	86885	She	166	" How stupid of you - you 've forgotten Mr. Hoppus ! "
86919	86940	86916	86916	Nick	224	" We left him in the temple of Vesta . Darling , I had other things to think of there . "
86941	86948	86950	86950	Julia	138	" I 'll send for him , "
86952	86962	86963	86963	he	224	" Lord , can you think of him now ? "
86966	86976	86916	86916	Nick	224	" Of course I can - more than ever . "
86977	86985	86988	86988	he	224	" Shall we go back for him ? "
87013	87023	87024	87024	she	138	" Of course I know you 're fearfully vague , "
87028	87047	86916	86916	Nick	224	" I was n't vague at all . But you were in such a hurry to get away . "
87048	87060	86992	86992	She	138	" It does n't signify . I 've another at home . "
87061	87067	87068	87068	he	224	" Another summer - house ? "
87073	87080	86992	86992	She	138	" A copy of Mr. Hoppus . "
87081	87095	86992	86992	She	138	" Mercy , how you go in for him ! Fancy having two ! "
87096	87117	86992	86992	She	138	" He sent me the number of the magazine , and the other 's the one that comes every month . "
87118	87124	87127	87127	his	224	" Every month ; I see "
87162	87171	87172	87172	Julia	138	" Did you suppose they come every day ? "
87176	87183	87190	87190	he	224	" Dear no , thank God ! "
87202	87217	87190	87190	he	224	" Delightful English pastoral scene . Why do they say it wo n't paint ? "
87218	87225	87190	87190	he	224	" Who says it wo n't ? "
87226	87248	87190	87190	he	224	" I do n't know - some of them . It will in France ; but somehow it wo n't here . "
87249	87256	87257	87258	Mrs. Dallow	166	" What are you talking about ? "
87282	87288	87276	87276	he	224	" Is Broadwood very charming ? "
87289	87318	87319	87319	she	138	" Have you never been there ? It shows how you 've treated me . We used to go there in August . George had ideas about it , "
87357	87367	87369	87369	she	138	" George had ideas about a great many things . "
87397	87403	87404	87404	she	138	" Broadwood 's just right , "
87409	87440	87404	87404	she	138	" It 's neither too small nor too big , and it takes care of itself . There 's nothing to be done : you ca n't spend a penny . "
87441	87451	87369	87369	she	138	" And do n't you want to use it ? "
87452	87461	87463	87463	Julia	138	" We can go and stay with them , "
87465	87475	87477	87477	Nick	224	" They 'll think I bring them an angel . "
87496	87519	87491	87491	his	224	" As they regard you yourself as an angel they 'll take it as natural of you to associate with your kind . "
87520	87525	87526	87526	he	224	" Oh my kind ! "
87568	87578	87565	87565	she	138	" What did you mean that night in Paris ? "
87579	87585	87565	87565	she	138	" That night - - ? "
87586	87606	87565	87565	she	138	" When you came to the hotel with me after we had all dined at that place with Peter . "
87607	87615	87565	87565	she	138	" What did I mean - - ? "
87616	87635	87565	87565	she	138	" About your caring so much for the fine arts . You seemed to want to frighten me . "
87636	87658	87565	87565	she	138	" Why should you have been frightened ? I ca n't imagine what I had in my head : not now . "
87659	87664	87666	87666	Julia	138	" You are vague , "
87672	87679	87565	87565	she	138	" Not about the great thing . "
87680	87685	87565	87565	she	138	" The great thing ? "
87686	87709	87565	87565	she	138	" That I owe you everything an honest man has to offer . How can I care about the fine arts now ? "
87718	87728	87730	87730	she	138	" Is it because you think you owe it - "
87746	87758	87759	87759	She	138	" that you 've spoken to me as you did there ? "
87767	87781	87730	87730	she	138	" I think I spoke to you because I could n't help it . "
87782	87787	87789	87789	she	138	" You are vague ! "
87794	87804	87730	87730	she	138	" You affect me differently from any other woman . "
87805	87823	87824	87824	she	138	" Oh other women - - ! Why should n't you care about the fine arts now ? "

87853	87872	87730	87730	she	138	" I do n't expect you to give up anything . I only expect you to do more . "
87873	87887	87730	87730	she	138	" To do more I must do less . I 've no talent . "
87888	87892	87730	87730	she	138	" No talent ? "
87893	87899	87730	87730	she	138	" I mean for painting . "
87905	87916	87900	87900	Julia	138	" That 's odious ! You have - you must . "
87922	87944	87917	87917	He	2110	" You 're altogether delightful . But how little you know about it - about the honourable practice of any art ! "
87945	87968	87730	87730	she	138	" What do you call practice ? You 'll have all our things - you 'll live in the midst of them . "
87969	87983	87917	87917	He	2110	" Certainly I shall enjoy looking at them , being so near them . "
87984	87995	87730	87730	she	138	" Do n't say I 've taken you away then . "
87996	88003	87917	87917	He	2110	" Taken me away - - ? "
88004	88047	87730	87730	she	138	" From the love of art . I like them myself now , poor George 's treasures . I did n't of old so much , because it seemed to me he made too much of them - he was always talking . "
88048	88057	88059	88059	Nick	224	" Well , I wo n't always talk , "
88061	88073	87730	87730	she	138	" You may do as you like - they 're yours . "
88074	88081	88082	88082	Nick	224	" Give them to the nation , "
88086	88098	88082	88082	Nick	224	" I like that ! When we 've done with them . "
88099	88132	87730	87730	she	138	" We shall have done with them when your Vandykes and Moronis have cured me of the delusion that I may be of their family . Surely that wo n't take long . "
88133	88139	88141	88141	Julia	138	" You shall paint me , "
88143	88150	88151	88151	He	224	" Never , never , never ! "
88196	88207	88176	88176	he	224	" Sha n't we really go and fetch Mr. Hoppus ? "
88211	88222	88208	88208	She	138	" You may go ; I wo n't , please . "
88223	88231	88176	88176	he	224	" That 's not what I want . "
88232	88243	88208	88208	She	138	" Oblige me by going . I 'll wait here . "
88353	88361	88362	88362	he	224	" Why did you basely desert me ? "
88370	88382	88362	88362	he	224	" I do n't know . Because I 'm so happy . "
88383	88390	88362	88362	he	224	" May I tell mother then ? "
88391	88401	88362	88362	he	224	" You may tell her she shall have Broadwood . "

In this retrospective vein , at the head of his table , the old gentleman enjoyed a hearing , or at any rate commanded a silence , often intense . Every one left it to some one else to ask another question ; and when by chance some one else did so every one was struck with admiration at any one 's being able to say anything . Nick knew the moment when he himself would take a glass of a particular port and , surreptitiously looking at his watch , perceive it was ten o'clock . That timepiece might as well mark 1830 .
90849	90867	90868	90868	Chayter	271	" Mr. Carteret will be in the drawing - room at a quarter to eight , sir , "

92562	92577	92557	92559	the old man	2238	" You wo n't do them justice - you wo n't do them justice . "

93136	93150	93252	93254	the old man	2238	" According to that I ought to take up my abode at Harsh . "

93170	93178	93179	93179	Nick	224	" It ought to be rather convenient , "
93183	93216	93179	93179	Nick	224	" I 've got a piece of news for you which I 've kept , as one keeps that sort of thing - for it 's very good - till the last . "
93257	93275	93252	93254	the old man	2238	" I should indeed be very happy to hear that you 've arranged to take a wife . "
93276	93291	93292	93292	Nick	224	" Mrs. Dallow has been so good as to say she 'll marry me , "
93295	93308	93292	93292	Nick	224	" That 's very suitable . I should think it would answer . "
93309	93315	93317	93317	Nick	224	" It 's very jolly , "
93351	93360	93292	93292	Nick	224	" Your dear father would have liked it . "
93361	93367	93292	93292	Nick	224	" So my mother says . "
93368	93375	93292	93292	Nick	224	" And she must be delighted . "
93376	93384	93385	93385	Nick	224	" Mrs. Dallow , do you mean ? "
93388	93436	93292	93292	Nick	224	" I was thinking of your mother . But I do n't exclude the charming lady . I remember her as a little girl . I must have seen her at Windrush . Now I understand the fine spirit with which she threw herself into your canvass . "
93437	93444	93446	93446	Nick	224	" It was her they elected , "
93448	93454	93455	93456	his host	775	" I do n't know , "
93460	93506	93455	93456	his host	775	" that I 've ever been an enthusiast for political women , but there 's no doubt that in approaching the mass of electors a graceful , affable manner , the manner of the real English lady , is a force not to be despised . "
93507	93524	93525	93525	Nick	224	" Julia 's a real English lady and at the same time a very political woman , "
93528	93558	93455	93456	his host	775	" Is n't it rather in the family ? I remember once going to see her mother in town and finding the leaders of both parties sitting with her . "
93559	93587	93589	93589	Nick	224	" My principal friend , of the others , is her brother Peter . I do n't think he troubles himself much about that sort of thing , "
93591	93599	93600	93601	Mr. Carteret	152	" What does he trouble himself about ? "
93608	93623	93677	93677	he	152	" He 's in the diplomatic service ; he 's a secretary in Paris . "
93624	93630	93632	93634	the old man	2238	" That may be serious , "
93636	93657	93658	93658	Nick	224	" He takes a great interest in the theatre . I suppose you 'll say that may be serious too , "
93661	93664	93658	93658	Nick	224	" Oh ! "
93680	93689	93677	93677	he	152	" Well , it ca n't hurt you . "
93690	93697	93677	93677	he	152	" It ca n't hurt me ? "
93698	93709	93677	93677	he	152	" If Mrs. Dallow takes an interest in your interests . "
93710	93727	93677	93677	he	152	" When a man 's in my situation he feels as if nothing could hurt him . "
93728	93737	93739	93740	Mr. Carteret	152	" I 'm very glad you 're happy , "
93892	93927	93928	93929	Mr. Carteret	152	" It 's good to marry and I think it 's right . I 've not done right , I know that . If she 's a good woman it 's the best thing , "
93933	93953	93928	93929	Mr. Carteret	152	" It 's what I 've been hoping for you . Sometimes I 've thought of speaking to you . "
93954	93962	93964	93964	Nick	224	" She 's a very good woman , "
93966	93975	93976	93977	Mr. Carteret	152	" And I hope she 's not poor . "
93985	94008	93976	93977	Mr. Carteret	152	" No indeed , she 's rich . Her husband , whom I knew and liked , left her a large fortune . "
94009	94019	93976	93977	Mr. Carteret	152	" And on what terms does she enjoy it ? "
94020	94028	94030	94030	Nick	224	" I have n't the least idea , "
94036	94052	94053	94053	he	152	" I see . It does n't concern you . It need n't concern you , "
94071	94084	94068	94068	he	224	" I daresay she can do what she likes with her money . "
94085	94095	94097	94098	Mr. Carteret	152	" So can I , my dear young friend , "
94134	94146	94119	94119	He	224	" That must be very pleasant , if one has any . "
94147	94156	94113	94115	the old man	2238	" I wish you had a little more . "
94157	94164	94166	94166	Nick	224	" I do n't particularly care , "
94168	94181	94182	94183	Mr. Carteret	152	" Your marriage will assist you ; you ca n't help that , "
94186	94201	94182	94183	Mr. Carteret	152	" But I should like you to be under obligations not quite so heavy . "
94202	94217	94113	94115	the old man	2238	" Oh I 'm so obliged to her for caring for me - - ! "
94218	94246	94182	94183	Mr. Carteret	152	" That the rest does n't count ? Certainly it 's nice of her to like you . But why should n't she ? Other people do . "
94247	94260	94262	94262	Nick	224	" Some of them make me feel as if I abused it , "
94269	94284	94285	94285	he	224	" That is , they do n't make me , but I feel it , "
94288	94293	94296	94297	Mr. Carteret	152	" I 've no son "
94309	94319	94320	94320	he	152	" Sha n't you be very kind to her ? "
94323	94330	94320	94320	he	152	" You 'll gratify her ambition . "
94331	94341	94296	94297	Mr. Carteret	152	" Oh she thinks me cleverer than I am . "
94342	94351	94352	94354	the old gentleman	6634	" That 's because she 's in love , "
94363	94385	94387	94387	he	6634	" However , you must be as clever as we think you . If you do n't prove so - - ! "
94394	94402	94404	94404	Nick	224	" Well , if I do n't ? "
94406	94418	94420	94421	Mr. Carteret	152	" Oh it wo n't do - it wo n't do , "
94433	94441	94442	94442	he	152	" I say I 've no son , "
94445	94458	94442	94442	he	152	" but if I had had one he should have risen high . "
94459	94481	94525	94526	Mr. Carteret	152	" It 's well for me such a person does n't exist . I should n't easily have found a wife . "
94482	94498	94442	94442	he	152	" He would have gone to the altar with a little money in his pocket . "
94499	94512	94513	94513	Nick	224	" That would have been the least of his advantages , sir , "
94516	94524	94525	94526	Mr. Carteret	152	" When are you to be married ? "
94529	94542	94442	94442	he	152	" Ah that 's the question . Julia wo n't yet say . "
94543	94546	94548	94550	the old man	2238	" Well , "
94556	94572	94548	94550	the old man	2238	" you may consider that when it comes off I 'll make you a settlement . "
94573	94584	94585	94585	Nick	224	" I feel your kindness more than I can express , "
94588	94606	94585	94585	Nick	224	" but that will probably be the moment when I shall be least conscious of wanting anything . "
94607	94629	94630	94631	Mr. Carteret	152	" You 'll appreciate it later - you 'll appreciate it very soon . I shall like you to appreciate it , "
94658	94669	94655	94655	he	152	" Your father would have liked you to appreciate it . "
94670	94674	94675	94675	Nick	224	" Poor father ! "
94747	94756	94757	94757	he	152	" How much do you expect of me ? "
94764	94861	94757	94757	he	152	" Well , Nicholas , only what your father did . He so often spoke of you , I remember , at the last , just after you had been with him alone - you know I saw him then . He was greatly moved by his interview with you , and so was I by what he told me of it . He said he should live on in you - he should work in you . It has always given me a special feeling , if I may use the expression , about you . "
94862	94893	94894	94894	Nick	224	" The feelings are indeed not usual , dear Mr. Carteret , which take so munificent a form . But you do - oh you do - expect too much , "
94900	94908	94909	94911	the old man	2238	" I expect you to repay me ! "
94915	94928	94909	94911	the old man	2238	" As for the form , I have it in my mind . "
94929	94935	94757	94757	he	152	" The form of repayment ? "
94936	94942	94909	94911	the old man	2238	" The form of repayment ! "
94943	94952	94954	94954	Nick	224	" Ah do n't talk of that now , "
94956	94985	94954	94954	Nick	224	" for , you see , nothing else is settled . No one has been told except my mother . She has only consented to my telling you . "
94986	94994	94909	94911	the old man	2238	" Lady Agnes , do you mean ? "
94995	95032	95033	95033	Nick	224	" Ah no ; dear mother would like to publish it on the house - tops . She 's so glad - she wants us to have it over to - morrow . But Julia herself , "
95036	95052	95033	95033	Nick	224	" wishes to wait . Therefore kindly mention it for the present to no one . "
95053	95075	94909	94911	the old man	2238	" My dear boy , there 's at this rate nothing to mention ! What does Julia want to wait for ? "
95076	95089	95033	95033	Nick	224	" Till I like her better - that 's what she says . "
95090	95102	95103	95104	Mr. Carteret	152	" It 's the way to make you like her worse , "
95108	95115	95103	95104	Mr. Carteret	152	" Has n't she your affection ? "
95116	95128	95033	95033	Nick	224	" So much so that her delay makes me exceedingly unhappy . "
95153	95161	95148	95148	he	152	" Then what more does she want ? "
95185	95200	95181	95182	the latter	686	" I do n't understand . You 're engaged or you 're not engaged . "
95201	95228	95148	95148	he	152	" She is , but I 'm not . That 's what she says about it . The trouble is she does n't believe in me . "
95236	95244	95229	95230	Mr. Carteret	152	" Does n't she love you then ? "
95245	95289	95181	95182	the latter	686	" That 's what I ask her . Her answer is that she loves me only too well . She 's so afraid of being a burden to me that she gives me my freedom till I 've taken another year to think . "
95290	95301	95302	95303	Mr. Carteret	152	" I like the way you talk about other years ! "
95306	95320	95302	95303	Mr. Carteret	152	" You had better do it while I 'm here to bless you . "
95321	95336	95338	95338	Nick	224	" She thinks I proposed to her because she got me in for Harsh , "
95340	95354	95181	95182	the latter	686	" Well , I 'm sure it would be a very pretty return . "
95355	95364	95365	95367	the young man	445	" Ah she does n't believe in me , "
95370	95379	95181	95182	the latter	686	" Then I do n't believe in her . "
95380	95407	95181	95182	the latter	686	" Do n't say that - do n't say that . She 's a very rare creature . But she 's proud , shy , suspicious . "
95408	95413	95181	95182	the latter	686	" Suspicious of what ? "
95414	95425	95181	95182	the latter	686	" Of everything . She thinks I 'm not persistent . "
95426	95431	95181	95182	the latter	686	" Oh , oh ! "
95440	95452	95181	95182	the latter	686	" She ca n't believe I shall arrive at true eminence . "
95453	95464	95466	95467	Mr. Carteret	152	" A good wife should believe what her husband believes , "
95469	95472	95475	95475	Nick	224	" Ah unfortunately "
95483	95491	95475	95475	Nick	224	" I do n't believe it either . "
95511	95517	95492	95493	Mr. Carteret	152	" Your dear father did . "
95518	95529	95530	95530	Nick	224	" I think of that - I think of that , "
95533	95547	95548	95548	he	224	" Certainly it will help me . If I say we 're engaged , "
95552	95574	95548	95548	he	224	" it 's because I consider it so . She gives me my liberty , but I do n't take it . "
95575	95586	95492	95493	Mr. Carteret	152	" Does she expect you to take back your word ? "
95587	95607	95548	95548	he	224	" That 's what I ask her . She never will . Therefore we 're as good as tied . "
95608	95615	95617	95618	Mr. Carteret	152	" I do n't like it , "
95623	95645	95617	95618	Mr. Carteret	152	" I do n't like ambiguous , uncertain situations . They please me much better when they 're definite and clear . "
95681	95690	95673	95673	he	224	" Do n't disappoint me , dear boy . "
95691	95696	95697	95698	his visitor	1421	" Ah not willingly ! "
95701	95741	95742	95743	Mr. Carteret	152	" I 've told you what I should like to do for you . See that the conditions come about promptly in which I may , do it . Are you sure you do everything to satisfy Mrs. Dallow ? "
95746	95756	95757	95757	Nick	224	" I think I 'm very nice to her , "
95760	95781	95757	95757	Nick	224	" But she 's so ambitious . Frankly speaking , it 's a pity for her that she likes me . "
95782	95789	95790	95792	the old man	2238	" She ca n't help that ! "
95796	95829	95742	95743	Mr. Carteret	152	" Possibly . But is n't it a reason for taking me as I am ? What she wants to do is to take me as I may be a year hence . "
95830	95851	95853	95854	Mr. Carteret	152	" I do n't understand - since you tell me that even then she wo n't take back her word , "
95856	95873	95742	95743	Mr. Carteret	152	" If she does n't marry me I think she 'll never marry again at all . "
95874	95883	95742	95743	Mr. Carteret	152	" What then does she gain by delay ? "
95884	95894	95896	95896	Nick	224	" Simply this , as I make it out , "
95898	95926	95896	95896	Nick	224	" that she 'll feel she has been very magnanimous . She wo n't have to reproach herself with not having given me a chance to change . "
95927	95940	95742	95743	Mr. Carteret	152	" To change ? What does she think you liable to do ? "
95946	95952	95953	95953	he	224	" I do n't know ! "
95962	95979	95980	95981	Mr. Carteret	152	" Everything has altered : young people in my day looked at these questions more naturally , "
95984	96007	96008	96008	he	152	" A woman in love has no need to be magnanimous . If she plays too fair she is n't in love , "
96012	96023	96024	96024	Nick	224	" Oh , Julia 's safe - she 's safe , "
96027	96053	96024	96024	Nick	224	" If it were a question between you and another gentleman one might comprehend . But what does it mean , between you and nothing ? "
96054	96064	96065	96065	Nick	224	" I 'm much obliged to you , sir , "
96068	96084	96065	96065	Nick	224	" The trouble is that she does n't know what she has got hold of . "
96085	96098	96101	96102	his friend	610	" Ah , if you ca n't make it clear to her ! "
96109	96116	96118	96120	the young man	445	" I 'm such a humbug , "
96130	96141	96127	96127	he	224	" I deceive people without in the least intending it . "
96142	96155	96127	96127	he	224	" What on earth do you mean ? Are you deceiving me ? "
96156	96169	96127	96127	he	224	" I do n't know - it depends on what you think . "
96170	96177	96179	96180	Mr. Carteret	152	" I think you 're flighty , "
96195	96202	96179	96180	Mr. Carteret	152	" I never thought so before . "
96203	96225	96127	96127	he	224	" Forgive me ; it 's all right . I 'm not frivolous ; that I promise you I 'm not . "
96226	96235	96179	96180	Mr. Carteret	152	" You have deceived me if you are . "
96236	96242	96243	96243	Nick	224	" It 's all right , "
96249	96258	96179	96180	Mr. Carteret	152	" Remember your name - carry it high . "
96259	96268	96179	96180	Mr. Carteret	152	" I will - as high as possible . "
96269	96286	96179	96180	Mr. Carteret	152	" You 've no excuse . Do n't tell me , after your speeches at Harsh ! "
96335	96337	96333	96333	he	224	" clever "
96341	96343	96338	96338	ah	2326	" clever "
96361	96412	96357	96358	Mr. Carteret	152	" If , as you express it , Mrs. Dallow does n't know what she has got hold of , wo n't it clear the matter up a little by informing her that the day before your marriage is definitely settled to take place you 'll come into something comfortable ? "
96440	96497	96437	96437	his	224	" Oh I 'm afraid that wo n't do any good . It would make her like you better , but it would n't make her like me . I 'm afraid she wo n't care for any benefit that comes to me from another hand than hers . Her affection 's a very jealous sentiment . "
96498	96506	96508	96509	Mr. Carteret	152	" It 's a very peculiar one ! "
96511	96532	96508	96509	Mr. Carteret	152	" Mine 's a jealous sentiment too . However , if she takes it that way do n't tell her . "
96533	96546	96548	96548	Nick	224	" I 'll let you know as soon as she comes round , "
96550	96558	96559	96560	Mr. Carteret	152	" And you 'll tell your mother , "
96563	96571	96559	96560	Mr. Carteret	152	" I shall like her to know . "
96572	96588	96508	96509	Mr. Carteret	152	" It will be delightful news to her . But she 's keen enough already . "
96589	96605	96606	96608	the old man	2238	" I know that . I may mention now that she has written to me , "
96611	96616	96606	96608	the old man	2238	" So I suspected . "
96617	96628	96629	96630	Mr. Carteret	152	" We 've - a - corresponded on the subject , "
96635	96652	96629	96630	Mr. Carteret	152	" My view of the advantageous character of such an alliance has entirely coincided with hers . "
96653	96670	96672	96672	Nick	224	" It was very good - natured of you then to leave me to speak first , "
96674	96702	96629	96630	Mr. Carteret	152	" I should have been disappointed if you had n't . I do n't like all you 've told me . But do n't disappoint me now . "
96703	96708	96709	96709	Nick	224	" Dear Mr. Carteret ! "
96715	96722	96723	96724	that gentleman	1269	" I wo n't disappoint you , "
98026	98029	98017	98018	The girl	481	" all right "
98319	98321	98312	98312	he	144	" worldly "
98644	98646	98641	98642	the girl	481	" gift "
98736	98739	98734	98734	she	175	" do anything "
99054	99056	99047	99047	she	178	" working "
99635	99650	99655	99655	she	178	" Ah if you pity me tell me you 've got her an engagement ! "
99660	99705	99707	99707	he	144	" I took a great deal of trouble ; I wrote ever so many notes , sought introductions , talked with people - such impossible people some of them . In short I knocked at every door , I went into the question exhaustively . "
99884	99905	99906	99907	Mrs. Rooth	178	" But new performers appear ; they get theatres , they get audiences , they get notices in the newspapers , "
99910	99932	99906	99907	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I know of these things only what Miriam tells me . It 's no knowledge that I was born to . "
99933	99946	99998	99998	Peter	144	" It 's perfectly true . It 's all done with money . "
99947	99956	99906	99907	Mrs. Rooth	178	" And how do they come by money ? "
99962	99973	99998	99998	Peter	144	" When they 're women people give it to them . "
99974	99981	99998	99998	Peter	144	" Well , what people now ? "
99982	99989	99998	99998	Peter	144	" People who believe in them . "
99990	99997	99998	99998	Peter	144	" As you believe in Miriam ? "
100003	100026	99998	99998	Peter	144	" No , rather differently . A poor man does n't believe in anything the same way that a rich man does . "
100027	100035	100037	100038	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Ah do n't call yourself poor ! "
100040	100051	100037	100038	Mrs. Rooth	178	" What good would it do me to be rich ? "
100052	100067	99998	99998	Peter	144	" Why you could take a theatre . You could do it all yourself . "
100068	100077	100037	100038	Mrs. Rooth	178	" And what good would that do me ? "
100078	100088	100090	100091	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Ah do n't you delight in her genius ? "
100093	100109	100110	100110	Sherringham	144	" I delight in her mother . You think me more disinterested than I am , "
100119	100128	100129	100130	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I know why you did n't write ! "
100134	100141	100142	100142	Peter	144	" You must go to London , "
100149	100191	100129	100130	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Ah if we could only get there it would be a relief . I should draw a long breath . There at least I know where I am and what people are . But here one lives on hollow ground ! "
100192	100201	100202	100204	our young man	528	" The sooner you get away the better , "
100208	100216	100129	100130	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I know why you say that . "
100217	100226	100129	100130	Mrs. Rooth	178	" It 's just what I 'm explaining . "
100227	100244	100246	100247	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I could n't have held out if I had n't been so sure of Miriam , "
100249	100260	100202	100204	our young man	528	" Well , you need n't hold out any longer . "
100261	100268	100270	100270	Sherringham	144	" Do n't you trust her ? "
100274	100278	100129	100130	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Trust her ? "
100279	100309	100202	100204	our young man	528	" You do n't trust yourself . That 's why you were silent , why we might have thought you were dead , why we might have perished ourselves . "
100310	100329	100330	100330	Peter	144	" I do n't think I understand you ; I do n't know what you 're talking about , "
100333	100340	100330	100330	Peter	144	" But it does n't matter . "
100341	100355	100356	100358	the old woman	1320	" Does n't it ? Let yourself go . Why should you struggle ? "
100429	100476	100404	100404	he	1376	" It 's a great mistake , either way , for a man to be in love with an actress . Either it means nothing serious , and what 's the use of that ? or it means everything , and that 's still more delusive . "
100477	100480	100499	100500	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Delusive ? "
100481	100486	100404	100404	he	1376	" Idle , unprofitable . "
100487	100498	100499	100500	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Surely a pure affection is its own beautiful reward , "
100506	100517	100499	100500	Mrs. Rooth	178	" In such a case how can it be pure ? "
100518	100529	100530	100530	she	178	" I thought you were talking of an English gentleman , "
100533	100586	100499	100500	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Call the poor fellow whatever you like : a man with his life to lead , his way to make , his work , his duties , his career to attend to . If it means nothing , as I say , the thing it means least of all is marriage . "
100587	100593	100594	100595	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Oh my own Miriam ! "
100598	100621	100594	100595	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Fancy , on the other hand , the complication when such a man marries a woman who 's on the stage . "
100633	100642	100627	100627	she	178	" Miriam is n't on the stage yet . "
100643	100653	100499	100500	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Go to London and she soon will be . "
100654	100665	100627	100627	she	178	" Yes , and then you 'll have your excuse . "
100666	100670	100499	100500	Mrs. Rooth	178	" My excuse ? "
100671	100677	100627	100627	she	178	" For deserting us altogether . "
100696	100709	100692	100692	he	2426	" Show me some good acting and I wo n't desert you . "
100710	100743	100744	100745	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Good acting ? Ah what 's the best acting compared with the position of a true English lady ? If you 'll take her as she is you may have her , "
100749	100760	100499	100500	Mrs. Rooth	178	" As she is , with all her ambitions unassuaged ? "
100761	100773	100692	100692	he	2426	" To marry you - might not that be an ambition ? "
100774	100791	100793	100793	Peter	144	" A very paltry one . Do n't answer for her , do n't attempt that , "
100795	100802	100793	100793	Peter	144	" You can do much better . "
100803	100810	100812	100813	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Do you think you can ? "
100815	100842	100843	100845	the young man	445	" I do n't want to ; I only want to let it alone . She 's an artist ; you must give her her head , "
100848	100858	100843	100845	the young man	445	" You must always give an artist his head . "
100859	100879	100843	100845	the young man	445	" But I 've known great ladies who were artists . In English society there 's always a field . "
100880	100915	100916	100916	he	445	" Do n't talk to me of English society ! Thank goodness , in the first place , I do n't live in it . Do you want her to give up her genius ? "
100919	100929	100843	100845	the young man	445	" I thought you did n't care for it . "
100930	100945	100843	100845	the young man	445	" She 'd say , ' No I thank you , dear mamma . ' "
100946	100951	100843	100845	the young man	445	" My wonderful child ! "
100958	100967	100952	100953	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Have you ever proposed it to her ? "
100968	100972	100843	100845	the young man	445	" Proposed it ? "
100973	100981	100952	100953	Mrs. Rooth	178	" That she should give up trying . "
100989	101004	101005	101005	she	178	" Not for the reason you mean . We do n't talk about love , "
101008	101036	101037	101037	Peter	144	" Then it 's so much less time wasted . Do n't stretch out your hand to the worse when it may some day grasp the better , "
101062	101084	101059	101059	he	144	" Let her blaze out , let her look about her . Then you may talk to me if you like . "
101085	101091	101092	101094	the old woman	1320	" It 's very puzzling ! "
101105	101118	101098	101098	He	144	" Now do n't tell me I 'm not a good friend . "
101119	101142	101092	101094	the old woman	1320	" You are indeed - you 're a very noble gentleman . That 's just why a quiet life with you - - "
101143	101152	101153	101153	he	144	" It would n't be quiet for me ! "
101157	101168	101153	101153	he	144	" And that 's not what Miriam was made for . "
101169	101179	101180	101181	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Do n't say that for my precious one ! "
101184	101193	101194	101195	her visitor	1376	" Go to London - go to London , "
101236	101244	101231	101231	she	1320	" That 's what Mr. Dashwood says . "
101245	101249	101204	101204	she	1320	" Mr. Dashwood ? "
101250	101291	101231	101231	she	1320	" I forgot you do n't know him . He 's the brother of that lady we met the day you were so good as to receive us ; the one who was so kind to us - Mrs. Lovick . "
101292	101299	101204	101204	she	1320	" I never heard of him . "
101300	101365	101231	101231	she	1320	" Do n't you remember how she spoke of him and that Mr. Lovick did n't seem very nice about him ? She told us that if he were to meet us - and she was so good as to intimate that it would be a pleasure to him to do so - he might give us , as she said , a tip . "
101373	101386	101366	101366	Peter	144	" Yes he comes back to me . He 's an actor . "
101387	101394	101396	101397	Mrs. Rooth	178	" He 's a gentleman too , "
101399	101414	101204	101204	she	1320	" And you 've met him , and he has given you a tip ? "
101415	101428	101231	101231	she	1320	" As I say , he wants us to go to London . "
101429	101441	101204	101204	she	1320	" I see , but even I can tell you that . "
101442	101446	101448	101449	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Oh yes , "
101451	101460	101448	101449	Mrs. Rooth	178	" but he says he can help us . "
101461	101475	101204	101204	she	1320	" Keep hold of him then , if he 's in the business , "
101482	101489	101491	101492	Mrs. Rooth	178	" He 's a perfect gentleman , "
101494	101502	101491	101492	Mrs. Rooth	178	" He 's immensely struck with Miriam . "
101503	101513	101448	101449	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Better and better . Keep hold of him . "
101514	101525	101526	101526	she	178	" Well , I 'm glad you do n't object , "
101529	101535	101448	101449	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Why should I object ? "
101536	101547	101448	101449	Mrs. Rooth	178	" You do n't regard us as all your own ? "
101548	101566	101448	101449	Mrs. Rooth	178	" My own ? Why , I regard you as the public 's - the world 's . "
101573	101613	101567	101567	She	178	" There 's a sort of chill in that . It 's grand , but it 's cold . However , I need n't hesitate then to tell you that it 's with Mr. Dashwood Miriam has gone out . "
101614	101621	101448	101449	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Why hesitate , gracious heaven ? "
101630	101636	101627	101627	Sherringham	144	" Where have they gone ? "
101637	101644	101448	101449	Mrs. Rooth	178	" You do n't like it ! "
101649	101661	101567	101567	She	178	" Why should it be a thing to be enthusiastic about ? "
101662	101673	101567	101567	She	178	" Well , he 's charming and I trust him . "
101674	101679	101681	101681	Sherringham	144	" So do I , "
101683	101692	101567	101567	She	178	" They 've gone to see Madame CarrĂ . "
101693	101700	101567	101567	She	178	" She has come back then ? "
101701	101719	101567	101567	She	178	" She was expected back last week . Miriam wants to show her how she has improved . "
101720	101726	101567	101567	She	178	" And has she improved ? "
101727	101739	101741	101742	Mrs. Rooth	178	" How can I tell - with my mother 's heart ? "
101744	101764	101741	101742	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I do n't judge ; I only wait and pray . But Mr. Dashwood thinks she 's wonderful . "
101765	101778	101567	101567	She	178	" That 's a blessing . And when did he turn up ? "
101779	101834	101741	101742	Mrs. Rooth	178	" About a fortnight ago . We met Mrs. Lovick at the English church , and she was so good as to recognise us and speak to us . She said she had been away with her children - otherwise she 'd have come to see us . She had just returned to Paris . "
101835	101849	101850	101850	Peter	144	" Yes , I 've not yet seen her . I see Lovick , "
101853	101867	101850	101850	Peter	144	" but he does n't talk of his brother - in - law . "
101868	101882	101883	101884	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I did n't , that day , like his tone about him , "
101887	101918	101883	101884	Mrs. Rooth	178	" We walked a little way with Mrs. Lovick after church and she asked Miriam about her prospects and if she were working . Miriam said she had no prospects . "
101919	101928	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" That was n't very nice to me , "
101932	101947	101850	101850	Peter	144	" But when you had left us in black darkness what were our prospects ? "
101948	101960	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" I see . It 's all right . Go on . "
101961	101999	102001	102002	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Then Mrs. Lovick said her brother was to be in Paris a few days and she would tell him to come and see us . He arrived , she told him and he came . Voila ! "
102004	102021	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" So that now - so far as he is concerned - Miss Rooth has prospects ? "
102022	102030	102031	102031	she	178	" He is n't a manager unfortunately , "
102034	102040	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" Where does he act ? "
102041	102074	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" He is n't acting just now ; he has been abroad . He has been to Italy , I believe , and is just stopping here on his way to London . "
102075	102085	102087	102087	Sherringham	144	" I see ; he is a perfect gentleman , "
102089	102097	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" Ah you 're jealous of him ! "
102098	102127	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" No , but you 're trying to make me so . The more competitors there are for the glory of bringing her out the better for her . "
102128	102137	102139	102140	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Mr. Dashwood wants to take a theatre , "
102142	102150	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" Then perhaps he 's our man . "
102151	102159	102160	102160	she	178	" Oh if you 'd help him ! "
102164	102168	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" Help him ? "
102169	102176	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" Help him to help us . "
102177	102190	102192	102192	Sherringham	144	" We 'll all work together ; it will be very jolly , "
102195	102220	102221	102221	he	144	" It 's a sacred cause , the love of art , and we shall be a happy band . Dashwood 's his name ? "
102227	102235	102221	102221	he	144	" Mrs. Lovick was n't a Dashwood . "
102236	102254	102255	102256	Mrs. Rooth	178	" It 's his nom de thĂ Ă tre - Basil Dashwood . Do you like it ? "
102260	102273	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" You say that as Miriam might . Her talent 's catching ! "
102274	102307	102221	102221	he	144	" She 's always practising - always saying things over and over to seize the tone . I 've her voice in my ears . He wants her not to have any . "
102308	102315	101929	101929	Sherringham	144	" Not to have any what ? "
102316	102352	102221	102221	he	144	" Any nom de thĂ Ă tre . He wants her to use her own ; he likes it so much . He says it will do so well - you ca n't better it . "
102353	102360	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" He 's a capital adviser , "
102367	102376	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" I 'll come back to - morrow . "
102377	102394	102395	102396	his hostess	2045	" I wo n't ask you to wait for them - they may be so long , "
102399	102407	102408	102408	Peter	144	" Will he come back with her ? "
102416	102447	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" I hope so , at this hour . With my child in the streets I tremble . We do n't live in cabs , as you may easily suppose . "
102448	102455	102456	102456	Sherringham	144	" Did they go on foot ? "
102459	102469	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" Oh yes ; they started in high spirits . "
102470	102481	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" And is Mr. Basil Dashwood acquainted with Madame CarrĂ ? "
102482	102522	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" Ah no , but he longed to be introduced to her ; he persuaded Miriam to take him . Naturally she wishes to oblige him . She 's very nice to him - if he can do anything . "
102523	102532	102533	102533	Peter	144	" Quite right ; that 's the way ! "
102538	102555	102556	102557	Mrs. Rooth	178	" And she also wanted him to see what she can do for the great critic , "
102560	102570	102556	102557	Mrs. Rooth	178	" that terrible old woman in the red wig . "
102571	102582	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" That 's what I should like to see too , "
102589	102639	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" Oh she has gone ahead ; she 's pleased with herself . ' Work , work , work , ' said Madame CarrĂ . Well , she has worked , worked , worked . That 's what Mr. Dashwood is pleased with even more than with other things . "
102640	102649	102556	102557	Mrs. Rooth	178	" What do you mean by other things ? "
102650	102659	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" Oh her genius and her fine appearance . "
102660	102679	102556	102557	Mrs. Rooth	178	" He approves of her fine appearance ? I ask because you think he knows what will take . "
102680	102687	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" I know why you ask ! "
102693	102706	102688	102689	Mrs. Rooth	178	" He says it will be worth hundreds of thousands to her . "
102707	102719	102720	102720	Peter	144	" That 's the sort of thing I like to hear , "
102723	102732	102733	102733	he	144	" I 'll come in to - morrow , "
102736	102748	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" And shall you mind if Mr. Dash wood 's here ? "
102749	102756	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" Does he come every day ? "
102757	102765	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" Oh they 're always at it . "
102766	102772	102773	102773	He	144	" At it - - ? "
102777	102797	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" Why she acts to him - every sort of thing - and he says if it will do . "
102798	102808	102362	102362	Sherringham	144	" How many days has he been here then ? "
102813	102830	102809	102810	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Oh I do n't know ! Since he turned up they 've passed so quickly . "
102831	102846	102847	102847	Sherringham	144	" So far from ' minding ' it I 'm eager to see him , "
102850	102870	102847	102847	Sherringham	144	" and I can imagine nothing better than what you describe - if he is n't an awful ass . "
102871	102893	102894	102895	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Dear me , if he is n't clever you must tell us : we ca n't afford to be deceived ! "
102899	102910	102911	102911	she	178	" What do we know - how can we judge ? "
102925	102939	102914	102914	He	2433	" Oh , I 'll tell you frankly what I think of him ! "
103300	103319	103284	103284	Miriam	277	" For I am sick and capable of fears , Oppressed with wrongs and therefore full of fears . "
103494	103516	103491	103491	she	175	" Then speak again ; not all thy former tale , But this one word , whether thy tale be true . "
103545	103552	103578	103578	herself	175	" Go on , go on ! "
103649	103657	103658	103658	Sherringham	144	" Admirable , magnificent , go on , "
103661	103675	103658	103658	Sherringham	144	" go on to the end of the scene , do it all ! "
103919	103934	103904	103904	she	175	" How she feels it , sees it and really ' renders ' it ! "
104077	104083	104084	104084	he	144	" the huge firm earth , "
104282	104284	104286	104288	the young stranger	2476	" type "
104442	104483	104497	104497	she	481	" But thou art fair , and at thy birth , dear boy , Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great : Of Nature 's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast , And with the half - blown rose . "
104583	104600	104601	104601	Peter	144	" Where did she get hold of that - where did she get hold of that ? "
104609	104622	104601	104601	Peter	144	" She had n't got hold of it when I went away . "
104918	104924	104909	104909	she	481	" Ah the poor idiots ! "
104947	104953	104954	104956	the new visitor	2487	" What a splendid scolding ! "
105071	105100	105066	105066	They	2494	" That 's the sort of thing I meant ; that 's what I had in mind when I asked you to try to do something for me . "
105138	105146	105148	105150	the young woman	2497	" Have you got me an engagement ? "
105158	105169	105170	105170	she	2497	" Yes , he has done something splendid for me , "
105242	105254	105255	105255	Peter	144	" Yes , yes , something splendid , for a beginning , "
105289	105310	105311	105312	Mr. Dashwood	277	" It 's such a pity you could n't follow it ; you 'd have liked it so much better , "
105318	105332	105333	105335	the celebrated artist	2504	" Could n't follow it ? Do you take me for une sotte ? "
105338	105352	105333	105335	the celebrated artist	2504	" I suspect I followed it de plus pres que vous , monsieur ! "
105353	105364	105365	105366	Basil Dashwood	276	" Ah you see the language is so awfully fine , "
105374	105399	105365	105366	Basil Dashwood	276	" The language ? Why she rails like a fish - wife . Is that what you call language ? Ours is another business . "
105400	105418	105419	105419	Miriam	277	" If you understood , if you understood , you 'd see all the greatness of it , "
105428	105433	105419	105419	Miriam	277	" Such delicious expressions ! "
105434	105453	105454	105455	Madame CarrĂ	175	" On dit que c'est tres - fort . But who can tell if you really say it ? "
105458	105467	105468	105468	Sherringham	144	" Ah , par exemple , I can ! "
105471	105480	105468	105468	Sherringham	144	" Oh you - you 're a Frenchman . "
105481	105493	105495	105496	Basil Dashwood	276	" Could n't he make it out if he were n't ? "
105505	105511	105498	105500	The old woman	1320	" He would n't know . "
105512	105519	105468	105468	Sherringham	144	" That 's flattering to me . "
105520	105531	105532	105533	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Oh you - do n't you pretend to complain , "
105536	105546	105547	105547	she	175	" I prefer our imprecations - those of Camille , "
105551	105561	105547	105547	she	175	" They have the beauty des plus belles choses . "
105562	105569	105570	105570	Miriam	277	" I can say them too , "
105574	105577	105579	105580	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Insolente ! "
105582	105596	105579	105580	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Camille does n't squat down on the floor in the middle of them .
105597	105622	105623	105623	Miriam	277	" For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop . To me and to the state of my great grief Let kings assemble , "
105627	105643	105623	105623	Miriam	277	" Ah if you do n't feel the way she makes a throne of it ! "
105644	105654	105655	105655	Sherringham	144	" It 's really tremendously fine , chere madame , "
105658	105665	105655	105655	Sherringham	144	" There 's nothing like it . "
105666	105671	105672	105674	the old woman	1320	" Vous etes insupportables , "
105677	105688	105672	105674	the old woman	1320	" Stay with us . I 'll teach you Phedre . "
105689	105695	105696	105697	Basil Dashwood	276	" Ah Phadra , Phadra ! "
105707	105729	105730	105731	Madame CarrĂ	175	" You 've learned all I 've taught you , but where the devil have you learned what I have n't ? "
105735	105799	105730	105731	Madame CarrĂ	175	" I 've worked - I have ; you 'd call it work - all through the bright , late summer , all through the hot , dull , empty days . I 've battered down the door - I did hear it crash one day . But I 'm not so very good yet . I 'm only in the right direction . "
105800	105803	105805	105806	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Malicieuse ! "
105808	105815	105816	105817	the girl	481	" Oh I can beat that , "
105821	105838	105839	105839	Peter	144	" Did you wake up one morning and find you had grown a pair of wings ? "
105842	105863	105864	105864	he	144	" Because that 's what the difference amounts to - you really soar . Moreover , you 're an angel , "
105909	105954	105903	105903	she	481	" You know you read King John with me before you went away . I thought over immensely what you said . I did n't understand it much at the time - I was so stupid . But it all came to me later . "
105955	105963	105964	105964	Peter	144	" I wish you could see yourself , "
105967	106002	105964	105964	Peter	144	" My dear fellow , I do . What sort of a dunce do you take me for ? I did n't miss a vibration of my voice , a fold of my robe . "
106003	106015	106016	106016	Peter	144	" Well , I did n't see you troubling about it , "
106020	106035	105964	105964	Peter	144	" No one ever will . Do you think I 'd ever show it ? "
106036	106041	106042	106044	Basil Dashwood jocosely	276	" Ars celare artem , "
106047	106057	106059	106059	Sherringham	144	" You must first have the art to hide , "
106228	106252	106253	106254	Basil Dashwood	276	" If you have n't any art it 's not quite the same as if you did n't hide it , is it ? "
106259	106271	106272	106272	Miriam	277	" That 's right - say one of your clever things ! "
106276	106282	106283	106283	he	276	" You 're always acting , "
106311	106337	106339	106340	Madame CarrĂ	175	" And when you 've shown them your fish - wife , to your public de la - bas , what will you do next ? "
106342	106353	106369	106369	Sherringham	144	" I 'll do Juliet - I 'll do Cleopatra . "
106354	106364	106365	106366	Mr. Dashwood	277	" Rather a big bill , is n't it ? "
106377	106390	106392	106392	Sherringham	144	" Constance and Juliet - take care you do n't mix them , "
106394	106411	106412	106412	Miriam	277	" I want to be various . You once told me I had a hundred characters , "
106415	106423	106425	106427	the old actress	1121	" Ah , vous en etes la ? "
106429	106455	106425	106427	the old actress	1121	" You may have a hundred characters , but you 've only three plays . I 'm told that 's all there are in English . "
106468	106481	106456	106456	Miriam	277	" What arrangements have you made ? What do the people want ? "
106482	106489	106466	106466	Peter	144	" The people at the theatre ? "
106490	106513	106514	106515	Basil Dashwood	276	" I 'm afraid they do n't want King John , and I do n't believe they hunger for Antony and Cleopatra , "
106518	106537	106514	106515	Basil Dashwood	276	" Ships and sieges and armies and pyramids , you know : we must n't be too heavy . "
106538	106544	106545	106546	the girl	481	" Oh I hate scenery ! "
106549	106554	106556	106557	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Elle est superbe , "
106559	106575	106556	106557	Madame CarrĂ	175	" You must put those pieces on the stage : how will you do it ? "
106576	106591	106593	106594	Mr. Dashwood	276	" Oh we know how to get up a play in London , Madame CarrĂ "
106599	106609	106593	106594	Mr. Dashwood	276	" They put money on it , you know . "
106610	106660	106556	106557	Madame CarrĂ	175	" On it ? But what do they put in it ? Who 'll interpret them ? Who 'll manage a style like that - the style of which the rhapsodies she has just repeated are a specimen ? Whom have you got that one has ever heard of ? "
106661	106676	106677	106677	Dashwood	276	" Oh you 'll hear of a good deal when once she gets started , "
106691	106701	106702	106702	she	175	" I feel that you 'll become very bad , "
106707	106717	106702	106702	she	175	" I 'm glad I sha n't see it . "
106718	106731	106732	106733	the girl	481	" People will do things for me - I 'll make them , "
106736	106749	106732	106733	the girl	481	" I 'll stir them up so that they 'll have ideas . "
106750	106756	106702	106702	she	175	" What people , pray ? "
106757	106762	106763	106763	Peter	144	" Ah terrible woman ! "
106767	106780	106781	106782	Basil Dashwood	276	" We translate your pieces - there will be plenty of parts , "
106785	106823	106702	106702	she	175	" Why then go out of the door to come in at the window ? - especially if you smash it ! An English arrangement of a French piece is a pretty woman with her back turned . "
106824	106833	106834	106834	Sherringham	144	" Do you really want to keep her ? "
106863	106887	106855	106855	She	175	" No , you 're all too queer together . We could n't be bothered with you and you 're not worth it . "
106888	106909	106834	106834	Sherringham	144	" I 'm glad it 's ' together ' that we 're queer then - we can console each other . "
106910	106942	106944	106946	the old woman	1320	" If you only would ; but you do n't seem to ! In short I do n't understand you - I give you up . But it does n't matter , "
106949	107039	106944	106946	the old woman	1320	" for the theatre 's dead and even you , ma toute - belle , wo n't bring it to life . Everything 's going from bad to worse , and I do n't care what becomes of you . You would n't understand us here and they wo n't understand you there , and everything 's impossible , and no one 's a whit the wiser , and it 's not of the least consequence . Only when you raise your arms lift them just a little higher , "
107044	107052	107054	107054	Miriam	277	" My mother will be happier chez nous "
107069	107088	106944	106946	the old woman	1320	" You wo n't be in the least in the right path till your mother 's in despair . "
107089	107102	107103	107103	Sherringham	144	" Well , perhaps we can bring that about even in London , "
107107	107117	107118	107119	Mr. Dashwood	277	" Dear Mrs. Rooth - she 's great fun , "
107140	107151	107124	107124	Miriam	277	" You wo n't upset her , at any rate . "
107165	107186	107153	107153	she	1320	" I want to do the modern too . I want to do le drame , with intense realistic effects . "
107187	107208	107209	107210	her instructress	1799	" And do you want to look like the portico of the Madeleine when it 's draped for a funeral ? "
107213	107257	107209	107210	her instructress	1799	" Never , never . I do n't believe you 're various : that 's not the way I see you . You 're pure tragedy , with de grands Ă clats de voix in the great style , or you 're nothing . "
107258	107266	107267	107267	Peter	144	" Be beautiful - be only that , "
107273	107307	107267	107267	Peter	144	" Be only what you can be so well - something that one may turn to for a glimpse of perfection , to lift one out of all the vulgarities of the day . "
107331	107339	107341	107342	Basil Dashwood	276	" You 'll be the English Rachel , "
107347	107352	107353	107354	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Acting in French ! "
107357	107367	107353	107354	Madame CarrĂ	175	" I do n't believe in an English Rachel . "
107368	107382	107383	107383	Miriam	277	" I shall have to work it out , what I shall be , "
107391	107402	107403	107403	Sherringham	144	" You 're in wonderfully good form to - day , "
107429	107437	107408	107408	his	144	" I really mean to do everything . "
107438	107447	107408	107408	his	144	" Very well ; after all Garrick did . "
107448	107459	107408	107408	his	144	" Then I shall be the Garrick of my sex . "
107460	107480	107482	107483	Basil Dashwood	276	" There 's a very clever author doing something for me ; I should like you to see it , "
107496	107507	107509	107510	Madame CarrĂ	175	" Ah if you 've very clever authors - - ! "
107520	107530	107531	107531	Peter	144	" I shall be very happy to see it , "
107545	107558	107540	107541	Basil Dashwood	276	" May I ask you at what theatre you 've made arrangements ? "
107566	107580	107582	107582	he	276	" Come and see me at the embassy and I 'll tell you . "
107585	107594	107582	107582	he	276	" I know your sister , Mrs. Lovick . "
107595	107613	107582	107582	he	276	" So I supposed : that 's why I took the liberty of asking such a question . "
107614	107633	107635	107635	Miriam	277	" It 's no liberty , but Mr. Sherringham does n't appear to be able to tell you , "
107637	107657	107658	107658	Peter	144	" Well , you know , it 's a very curious world , all those theatrical people over there , "
107661	107676	107677	107678	Basil Dashwood	276	" Ah do n't say anything against them when I 'm one of them , "
107681	107690	107691	107691	Peter	144	" I might plead the absence of information , "
107694	107705	107691	107691	Peter	144	" as Miss Rooth has neglected to make us acquainted . "
107710	107718	107706	107706	Miriam	170	" I know you both so little . "
107744	107784	107720	107720	she	170	" Tiens ! you gentlemen meet here for the first time ? You do right to become friends - that 's the best thing . Live together in peace and mutual confidence . C'est de beaucoup le plus sage . "
107785	107793	107795	107795	Sherringham	211	" Certainly , for yoke - fellows , "
107845	107868	107840	107843	the heroines of Marivaux	2532	" Ah wait till you go - for that ! Do you suppose I care for news of your mountebanks ' booths ? "
108105	108108	108116	108116	Miriam	170	" bill , "
108215	108218	108212	108212	She	206	" in it "
108258	108262	108253	108253	She	206	" vieux jeu . "
108399	108446	108382	108383	the actress	1158	" How quiet she is , how wonderfully quiet ! Scarcely anything moves but her face and her voice . Le geste rare , but really expressive when it comes . I like that economy ; it 's the only way to make the gesture significant . "
108447	108459	108460	108462	Basil Dash wood	290	" I do n't admire the way she holds her arms , "
108465	108476	108460	108462	Basil Dash wood	290	" like a demoiselle de magasin trying on a jacket . "
108477	108498	108460	108462	Basil Dash wood	290	" Well , she holds them at any rate . I daresay it 's more than you do with yours . "
108499	108534	108460	108462	Basil Dash wood	290	" Oh yes , she holds them ; there 's no mistake about that . ' I hold them , I hope , hein ? ' she seems to say to all the house . "
108587	108649	108566	108566	he	144	" They teach them to be ladylike and Voisin 's always trying to show that . ' See how I walk , see how I sit , see how quiet I am and how I have le geste rare . Now can you say I ai n't a lady ? ' She does it all as if she had a class . "
108650	108661	108663	108663	Miriam	170	" Well , to - night I 'm her class , "
108665	108689	108566	108566	he	144	" Oh I do n't mean of actresses , but of femmes du monde . She shows them how to act in society . "
108690	108699	108700	108700	Miriam	170	" You had better take a few lessons , "
108703	108712	108713	108713	Peter	144	" Ah you should see Voisin in society , "
108716	108723	108724	108725	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Does she go into it ? "
108734	108742	108724	108725	Mrs. Rooth	178	" She receives a great many people . "
108743	108753	108754	108755	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Why should n't they when they 're nice ? "
108761	108768	108769	108769	Miriam	170	" When the people are nice ? "
108772	108786	108788	108789	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Now do n't tell me she 's not what one would wish , "
108793	108801	108802	108802	he	144	" It depends on what that is , "
108806	108817	108818	108820	the old woman	1320	" What I should wish if she were my daughter , "
108824	108845	108818	108820	the old woman	1320	" Ah wish your daughter to act as well as that and you 'll do the handsome thing for her ! "
108846	108857	108858	108859	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Well , she seems to feel what she says , "
108863	108878	108879	108880	Basil Dashwood	276	" She has some stiff things to say . I mean about her past , "
108883	108895	108879	108880	Basil Dashwood	276	" The past - the dreadful past - on the stage ! "
108896	108915	108917	108918	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Wait till the end , to see how she comes out . We must all be merciful ! "
108920	108932	108933	108933	Miriam	170	" We 've seen it before ; you know what happens , "
108939	108950	108879	108880	Basil Dashwood	276	" I 've seen so many I get them mixed . "
108951	108970	108972	108973	the girl	481	" Yes , they 're all in queer predicaments . Poor old mother - what we show you ! "
108975	108990	108879	108880	Basil Dashwood	276	" Ah it will be what you show me - something noble and wise ! "
108991	109004	109006	109006	Miriam	170	" I want to do this ; it 's a magnificent part , "
109008	109024	109025	109026	Basil Dashwood	276	" You could n't put it on in London - they would n't swallow it , "
109029	109043	109044	109045	the girl	481	" Are n't there things they do there to get over the difficulties ? "
109048	109058	109060	109061	her companion	505	" You ca n't get over what she did ! "
109067	109078	109079	109080	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Yes , we must pay , we must expiate ! "
109468	109476	109477	109477	she	170	" That 's Dunoyer 's first underskirt , "
109684	109687	109678	109680	the genius loci	2602	" at home "
109728	109733	109735	109736	Basil Dashwood	276	" old - fashioned , "
109816	109831	109833	109833	Miriam	170	" Oh it 's enough to see this ; it makes my heart beat , "
109835	109895	109833	109833	Miriam	170	" It 's full of the vanished past , it makes me cry . I feel them here , all , the great artists I shall never see . Think of Rachel - look at her grand portrait there ! - and how she stood on these very boards and trailed over them the robes of Hermione and Phedre . "
109987	109998	110000	110000	Miriam	170	" It 's all right . I produce an effect , "
110002	110023	110000	110000	Miriam	170	" it sha n't be said that I too have n't had my little success in the maison de Moliere . "
110269	110276	110278	110279	the actress	1158	" You deserve a happier lot , "
110322	110329	110330	110332	the old woman	1320	" Most delightful , most curious , "
110350	110408	110338	110339	Basil Dashwood	276	" But their ugliness - their ugliness : did you ever see such a collection of hideous people ? And those who were supposed to be good - looking - the beauties of the past - they 're worse than the others . Ah you may say what you will , nous sommes mieux que Ă a ! "
110498	110507	110508	110508	She	1158	" Vous allez me trouver bien lĂ gere ! "
110800	110810	110811	110812	the girl	481	" Fancy poor Dashwood cooped up there with mamma ! "
110816	110830	110832	110832	Sherringham	144	" You 're awfully cruel to him ; but that 's of course , "
110834	110851	110811	110812	the girl	481	" It seems to me I 'm as kind as you ; you sent him off . "
110852	110863	110811	110812	the girl	481	" That was for your mother ; she was tired . "
110864	110882	110811	110812	the girl	481	" Oh gammon ! And why , if I were cruel , should it be of course ? "
110883	110910	110811	110812	the girl	481	" Because you must destroy and torment and wear out - that 's your nature . But you ca n't help your type , can you ? "
110911	110915	110916	110916	she	481	" My type ? "
110919	110933	110811	110812	the girl	481	" It 's bad , perverse , dangerous . It 's essentially insolent . "
110934	110963	110811	110812	the girl	481	" And pray what 's yours when you talk like that ? Would you say such things if you did n't know the depths of my good nature ? "
110964	110974	110976	110976	Sherringham	144	" Your good nature all comes back to that , "
110978	111025	110976	110976	Sherringham	144	" It 's an abyss of ruin - for others . You 've no respect . I 'm speaking of the artistic character - in the direction and in the plentitude in which you have it . It 's unscrupulous , nervous , capricious , wanton . "
111026	111039	111040	111040	Miriam	170	" I do n't know about respect . One can be good , "
111045	111057	111058	111058	he	144	" It does n't matter so long as one 's powerful , "
111061	111109	111058	111058	he	144	" We ca n't have everything , and surely we ought to understand that we must pay for things . A splendid organisation for a special end , like yours , is so rare and rich and fine that we ought n't to grudge it its conditions . "
111110	111118	111119	111119	Miriam	170	" What do you call its conditions ? "
111129	111217	111122	111122	she	170	" Oh the need to take its ease , to take up space , to make itself at home in the world , to square its elbows and knock , others about . That 's large and free ; it 's the good nature you speak of . You must forage and ravage and leave a track behind you ; you must live upon the country you traverse . And you give such delight that , after all , you 're welcome - you 're infinitely welcome ! "
111218	111234	111235	111236	the girl	481	" I do n't know what you mean . I only care for the idea , "
111239	111284	111235	111236	the girl	481	" That 's exactly what I pretend - and we must all help you to it . You use us , you push us about , you break us up . We 're your tables and chair , the simple furniture of your life . "
111285	111295	111122	111122	she	170	" Whom do you mean by ' we ' ? "
111302	111316	111296	111296	Peter	144	" Oh do n't be afraid - there will be plenty of others ! "
111332	111353	111317	111317	She	481	" Poor Dashwood immured with mamma - he 's like a lame chair that one has put into the corner . "
111354	111375	111376	111377	her companion	505	" Do n't break him up before he has served . I really believe something will come out of him , "
111381	111391	111392	111392	he	505	" However , you 'll break me up first , "
111395	111403	111392	111392	he	505	" and him probably never at all . "
111404	111415	111376	111377	her companion	505	" And why shall I honour you so much more ? "
111416	111429	111392	111392	he	505	" Because I 'm a better article and you 'll feel that . "
111430	111441	111376	111377	her companion	505	" You 've the superiority of modesty - I see . "
111442	111459	111392	111392	he	505	" I 'm better than a young mountebank - I 've vanity enough to say that . "
111476	111497	111498	111498	she	481	" How you hate us ! Yes , at bottom , below your little cold taste , you hate us ! "
111525	111535	111501	111501	He	505	" Give it up : come away with me . "
111536	111542	111501	111501	He	505	" Come away with you ? "
111543	111552	111501	111501	He	505	" Leave this place . Give it up . "
111553	111573	111574	111574	she	481	" You brought me here , you insisted it should be only you , and now you must stay , "
111586	111598	111574	111574	she	481	" You should know what you want , dear Mr. Sherringham . "
111599	111614	111501	111501	He	505	" I do - I know now . Come away before you see her . "
111615	111620	111621	111621	she	481	" Before - - ? "
111626	111658	111659	111659	Miriam	170	" She 's success , this wonderful Voisin , she 's triumph , she 's full accomplishment : the hard , brilliant realisation of what I want to avert for you . "
111678	111687	111675	111675	he	2657	" Give it up - give it up . "
111701	111711	111695	111695	she	481	" Yes , you 're better than poor Dashwood . "
111712	111734	111659	111659	Miriam	170	" Give it up and we 'll live for ourselves , in ourselves , in something that can have a sanctity . "
111735	111744	111745	111746	the girl	481	" All the same you do hate us , "
111750	111793	111745	111746	the girl	481	" I do n't want to be conceited , but I mean that I 'm sufficiently fine and complicated to tempt you . I 'm an expensive modern watch with a wonderful escapement - therefore you 'll smash me if you can . "
111794	111799	111800	111800	she	481	" Never - never ! "
111807	111816	111817	111817	She	481	" You tell me the hour too well . "
111903	111917	111892	111892	he	144	" I wonder if that 's what your cousin had in his mind . "
111918	111924	111892	111892	he	144	" My cousin - - ? "
111925	111949	111892	111892	he	144	" What was his name ? Mr. Dormer ; that first day at Madame CarrĂ ' s. He offered to paint my portrait . "
111950	111961	111892	111892	he	144	" I remember . I put him up to it . "
111962	111969	111892	111892	he	144	" Was he thinking of this ? "
111970	111985	111892	111892	he	144	" I doubt if he has ever seen it . I daresay I was . "
111986	111999	112001	112001	Miriam	170	" Well , when we go to London he must do it , "
112003	112010	112011	112011	Peter	144	" Oh there 's no hurry , "
112017	112025	112027	112028	the girl	481	" Do n't you want my picture ? "
112036	112059	111892	111892	he	144	" I 'm not sure I want it from him . I do n't know quite what he 'd make of you . "
112060	112078	112011	112011	Peter	144	" He looked so clever - I liked him . I saw him again at your party . "
112079	112094	112095	112095	Peter	144	" He 's a jolly good fellow ; but what 's one to say , "
112100	112115	112095	112095	Peter	144	" of a painter who goes for his inspiration to the House of Commons ? "
112116	112123	112124	112124	she	481	" To the House of Commons ? "
112127	112135	112011	112011	Peter	144	" He has lately got himself elected . "
112136	112168	112011	112011	Peter	144	" Dear me , what a pity ! I wanted to sit for him . But perhaps he wo n't have me - as I 'm not a member of Parliament . "
112169	112183	112011	112011	Peter	144	" It 's my sister , rather , who has got him in . "
112184	112203	112204	112204	Miriam	170	" Your sister who was at your house that day ? What has she to do with it ? "
112207	112222	112223	112223	Sherringham	144	" Why she 's his cousin just as I am . And in addition , "
112236	112236	112223	112223	Sherringham	144	"
112237	112242	112243	112243	She	170	" Married - really ? "
112252	112261	112249	112249	she	170	" So he paints her , I suppose ? "
112262	112282	112249	112249	she	170	" Not much , probably . His talent in that line is n't what she esteems in him most . "
112283	112291	112249	112249	she	170	" It is n't great , then ? "
112292	112300	112249	112249	she	170	" I have n't the least idea . "
112301	112308	112309	112310	the girl	481	" And in the political line ? "
112313	112324	112309	112310	the girl	481	" I scarcely can tell . He 's very clever . "
112325	112333	112249	112249	she	170	" He does paint decently , then ? "
112334	112338	112309	112310	the girl	481	" I daresay . "
112350	112367	112344	112345	GĂ rĂ	296	" Fancy his going into the House of Commons ! And your sister put him there ? "
112368	112375	112409	112409	Sherringham	144	" She worked , she canvassed . "
112376	112384	112385	112385	she	170	" Ah you 're a queer family ! "
112397	112407	112409	112409	Sherringham	144	" We 're lost - here 's Mademoiselle Voisin , "
112420	112434	112414	112414	herself	2668	" I acted for you to - night - I did my best . "
112435	112448	112449	112450	the girl	481	" What a pleasure to speak to you , to thank you ! "
112460	112482	112483	112484	the actress	1158	" I could n't come to you before , but now I 've got a rest - for half an hour , "
112517	112536	112537	112537	she	1158	" I 'm sorry I make you lose the others - they 're so good in this act , "
112540	112555	112556	112556	Miriam	170	" We 've seen them before and there 's nothing so good as you , "
112560	112566	112568	112569	Mademoiselle Voisin	206	" I like my part , "
112584	112593	112568	112569	Mademoiselle Voisin	206	" One 's always better in that case . "
112594	112604	112605	112605	Peter	144	" She 's so bad sometimes , you know ! "
112644	112657	112658	112658	Miriam	170	" And it 's so interesting to be here - so interesting ! "
112661	112678	112680	112681	Mademoiselle Voisin	206	" Ah you like our old house ? Yes , we 're very proud of it . "
112697	112732	112733	112733	Miriam	170	" Well , here I am , and what do you want of me ? Do n't ask me to invent it myself , but if you 'll tell me I 'll do it . "
112751	112754	112741	112741	her	170	" old house "
112888	112901	112902	112902	Sherringham	144	" You 're lovely to - night - you 're particularly lovely , "
113020	113040	112970	112970	his	505	" Oh one 's always well enough when one 's made up ; one 's always exactly the same . "
113155	113174	113150	113150	she	170	" You acted for ' me ' ? How did you know ? What am I to you ? "
113175	113213	113256	113256	her	1158	" Monsieur Sherringham has told me about you . He says we 're nothing beside you - that you 're to be the great star of the future . I 'm proud that you 've seen me . "
113214	113225	113226	113226	Peter	144	" That of course is what I tell every one , "
113234	113251	113252	113253	the actress	1158	" I can believe it when I see you . Je vous ai bien observĂ e , "
113317	113329	113330	113330	she	170	" Ah you 're wonderful people - a most interesting impression ! "
113334	113352	113354	113355	the actress	1158	" I was looking for you ; he had prepared me . We 're such old friends ! "
113434	113450	113451	113451	he	144	" Your dressing - room is so pretty - show her your dressing - room , "
113455	113471	113451	113451	he	144	" Willingly , if she 'll come up . Vous savez que c'est une montĂ e. "
113472	113483	113484	113484	Miriam	170	" It 's a shame to inflict it on you , "
113487	113500	113501	113501	They	2696	" Comment donc ? If it will interest you in the least ! "
113548	113574	113575	113576	the girl	481	" No wonder she acts well when she has that tact - feels , perceives , is so remarkable , mon Dieu , mon Dieu ! "
113887	113893	113883	113884	The actress	1158	" Voila , c'est tout ! "
114169	114185	114164	114164	he	769	" Please do n't go back for the rest of the play . Stay here . "
114195	114207	114208	114208	She	170	" I want to stay here . I like it better , "
114237	114246	114233	114233	he	769	" I meant what I said just now . "
114247	114254	114233	114233	he	769	" What you said to Voisin ? "
114255	114271	114233	114233	he	769	" No , no ; to you . Give it up and live with me . "
114272	114277	114278	114278	She	170	" Give it up ? "
114286	114299	114233	114233	he	769	" Give it up and I 'll marry you to - morrow . "
114300	114310	114311	114311	she	170	" This is a happy time to ask it ! "
114317	114325	114311	114311	she	170	" And this is a good place ! "
114326	114354	114233	114233	he	769	" Very good indeed , and that 's why I speak : it 's a place to make one choose - it puts it all before one . "
114355	114376	114378	114378	Miriam	170	" To make you choose , you mean . I 'm much obliged , but that 's not my choice , "
114380	114390	114233	114233	he	769	" You shall be anything you like except this . "
114391	114405	114233	114233	he	769	" Except what I most want to be ? I am much obliged . "
114406	114420	114421	114421	Sherringham	144	" Do n't you care for me ? Have n't you any gratitude ? "
114424	114451	114233	114233	he	769	" Gratitude for kindly removing the blest cup from my lips ? I want to be what she is - I want it more than ever . "
114452	114459	114460	114460	He	144	" Ah what she is - ! "
114465	114490	114233	114233	he	769	" Do you mean I ca n't ? Well see if I ca n't . Tell me more about her - tell me everything . "
114491	114511	114233	114233	he	769	" Have n't you seen for yourself and , knowing things as you do , ca n't you judge ? "
114512	114521	114522	114522	Miriam	170	" She 's strange , she 's mysterious , "
114530	114542	114522	114522	Miriam	170	" She showed us nothing - nothing of her real self . "
114543	114553	114233	114233	he	769	" So much the better , all things considered . "
114554	114572	114573	114574	the girl	481	" Are there all sorts of other things in her life ? That 's what I believe , "
114584	114601	114233	114233	he	769	" I ca n't tell you what there is in the life of such a woman . "
114602	114611	114612	114612	she	481	" Imagine - when she 's so perfect ! "
114616	114673	114612	114612	she	481	" Ah she kept me off - she kept me off ! Her charming manner is in itself a kind of contempt . It 's an abyss - it 's the wall of China . She has a hard polish , an inimitable surface , like some wonderful porcelain that costs more than you 'd think . "
114674	114683	114684	114684	Sherringham	144	" Do you want to become like that ? "
114687	114701	114612	114612	she	481	" If I could I should be enchanted . One can always try . "
114702	114710	114711	114711	he	144	" You must act better than she , "
114715	114728	114612	114612	she	481	" Better ? I thought you wanted me to give it up . "
114729	114739	114740	114740	he	144	" Ah I do n't know what I want , "
114743	114761	114740	114740	he	144	" and you torment me and turn me inside out ! What I want is you yourself . "
114762	114768	114770	114770	Miriam	170	" Oh do n't worry , "
114786	114788	114777	114777	she	170	" call "
114816	114831	114813	114813	she	481	" Do you mean it wo n't do on account of mamma 's prejudices ? "
114832	114841	114777	114777	she	170	" Say this time on account of mine . "
114842	114851	114813	114813	she	481	" Do you mean because she has lovers ? "
114852	114861	114777	114777	she	170	" Her lovers are none of our business . "
114862	114878	114813	114813	she	481	" None of mine , I see . So you 've been one of them ? "
114879	114884	114777	114777	she	170	" No such luck ! "
114885	114890	114891	114891	she	481	" What a pity ! "
114895	114916	114891	114891	she	481	" I should have liked to see that . One must see everything - to be able to do everything . "
114933	114947	114930	114930	she	481	" The way a woman like that receives one of the old ones . "
114977	114986	114948	114948	Peter	144	" You 'll do - you 'll do ! "
115022	115036	115017	115017	she	610	" Does n't such a woman as that receive - receive every one ? "
115037	115049	115017	115017	she	610	" Every one who goes to see her , no doubt . "
115050	115055	115017	115017	she	610	" And who goes ? "
115056	115067	115017	115017	she	610	" Lots of men - clever men , eminent men . "
115068	115082	115017	115017	she	610	" Ah what a charming life ! Then does n't she go out ? "
115083	115108	115017	115017	she	610	" Not what we Philistines mean by that - not into society , never . She never enters a lady 's drawing - room . "
115109	115142	115017	115017	she	610	" How strange , when one 's as distinguished as that ; except that she must escape a lot of stupidities and corvĂ es . Then where does she learn such manners ? "
115143	115160	115017	115017	she	610	" She teaches manners , a ses heures : she does n't need to learn them . "
115161	115177	115178	115178	Miriam	170	" Oh she has given me ideas ! But in London actresses go into society , "
115181	115198	115017	115017	she	610	" Oh into ours , such as it is . In London nous melons les genres . "
115199	115212	115017	115017	she	610	" And sha n't I go - I mean if I want ? "
115213	115228	115017	115017	she	610	" You 'll have every facility to bore yourself . Do n't doubt it . "
115229	115237	115238	115238	Miriam	170	" And does n't she feel excluded ? "
115241	115252	115017	115017	she	610	" Excluded from what ? She has the fullest life . "
115253	115257	115017	115017	she	610	" The fullest ? "
115258	115300	115017	115017	she	610	" An intense artistic life . The cleverest men in Paris talk over her work with her ; the principal authors of plays discuss with her subjects and characters and questions of treatment . She lives in the world of art . "
115301	115319	115017	115017	she	610	" Ah the world of art - how I envy her ! And you offer me Dashwood ! "
115326	115334	115320	115320	Sherringham	144	" I ' offer ' you - ? "
115340	115359	115335	115335	Miriam	170	" You look so droll ! You offer me yourself , then , instead of all these things . "
115360	115373	115374	115374	he	144	" My dear child , I also am a very clever man , "
115390	115413	115414	115414	she	170	" You are - you are ; I delight in you . No ladies at all - no femmes comme il faut ? "
115418	115432	115433	115433	he	144	" Ah what do they matter ? Your business is the artistic life ! "
115452	115476	115433	115433	he	144	" You 're a dear - your charming good sense comes back to you ! What do you want of me , then ? "
115477	115499	115433	115433	he	144	" I want you for myself - not for others ; and now , in time , before anything 's done . "
115500	115522	115433	115433	he	144	" Why , then , did you bring me here ? Everything 's done - I feel it to - night . "
115523	115543	115544	115544	Sherringham	144	" I know the way you should look at it - if you do look at it at all , "
115547	115561	115562	115562	Miriam	170	" That 's so easy ! I thought you liked the stage so , "
115566	115578	115544	115544	Sherringham	144	" Do n't you want me to be a great swell ? "
115579	115589	115433	115433	he	144	" And do n't you want me to be ? "
115590	115601	115544	115544	Sherringham	144	" You will be - you 'll share my glory . "
115602	115609	115433	115433	he	144	" So will you share mine . "
115610	115624	115625	115625	Peter	144	" The husband of an actress ? Yes , I see myself that ! "
115634	115665	115666	115666	she	170	" It 's a silly position , no doubt . But if you 're too good for it why talk about it ? Do n't you think I 'm important ? "
115683	115710	115675	115675	she	170	" Ah why should we quarrel when you 've been so kind , so generous ? Ca n't we always be friends - the truest friends ? "
115772	115780	115764	115764	he	505	" Take care , here 's Dashwood ! "
115832	115834	115820	115820	she	170	" town "
115953	116036	116113	116113	she	170	" to dine with her that evening . Several members of this disconsolate class sought comfort in Great Stanhope Street in the afternoon , and them for the most part she also invited to return at eight o'clock . There were accordingly almost too many people at dinner ; there were even a couple of wives . Nick Dormer was then present , though he had not been in the afternoon . Each of the other persons had said on coming in , "
116048	116054	116113	116113	she	170	" Mrs. Dallow had replied , "
116062	116108	116057	116057	I	0	" but she had in no case added that she was glad , nor had she offered an explanation . She never offered explanations ; she always assumed that no one could invent them so well as those who had the florid taste to desire them .
116392	116402	116403	116403	she	262	" If he never was there they might talk , "
116689	116709	116710	116710	Julia	138	" See here , Julia , how long do you really expect me to endure this kind of thing ? "
116762	116774	116753	116753	he	224	" It 's so foolish - it 's so damnably foolish ! "
116793	116812	116787	116787	she	138	" I shall expect you on Tuesday , and I hope you 'll come by a decent train . "
116813	116823	116892	116892	she	138	" What do you mean by a decent train ? "
116824	116852	116787	116787	she	138	" I mean I hope you 'll not leave it till the last thing before dinner , so that we can have a little walk or something . "
116853	116885	116892	116892	she	138	" What 's a little walk or something ? Why , if you make such a point of my coming to Griffin , do you want me to come at all ? "
116895	116902	116892	116892	she	138	" I knew you hated it ! "
116903	116909	116911	116911	Nick	224	" You provoke me so , "
116913	116921	116911	116911	Nick	224	" You try to , I think . "
116922	116939	116940	116941	Mrs. Dallow	166	" And Severals is still worse . You 'll get out of that if you can , "
116945	116956	116911	116911	Nick	224	" If I can ? What 's to prevent me ? "
116957	116970	116911	116911	Nick	224	" You promised Lady Whiteroy . But of course that 's nothing . "
116971	116982	116911	116911	Nick	224	" I do n't care a straw for Lady Whiteroy . "
116983	116995	116911	116911	Nick	224	" And you promised me . But that 's less still . "
116996	117006	117008	117008	Nick	224	" It is foolish - it 's quite idiotic , "
117035	117048	117032	117032	Julia	138	" You might have answered Mr. Macgeorge when he spoke to you . "
117049	117061	116911	116911	Nick	224	" Mr. Macgeorge - what has he to do with it ? "
117062	117083	117032	117032	Julia	138	" He has to do with your getting on a little . If you think that 's the way - ! "
117090	117113	117084	117084	Nick	224	" I like lessons in getting on - in other words I suppose you mean in urbanity - from you , Julia ! "
117114	117120	116911	116911	Nick	224	" Why not from me ? "
117121	117174	117084	117084	Nick	224	" Because you can do nothing base . You 're incapable of putting on a flattering manner to get something by it : therefore why should you expect me to ? You 're unflattering - that is , you 're austere - in proportion as there may be something to be got . "
117185	117202	117175	117175	She	2782	" There 's only one thing I want in the world - you know very well . "
117203	117236	117237	117237	Nick	224	" Yes , you want it so much that you wo n't even take it when it 's pressed on you . How long do you seriously expect me to bear it ? "
117240	117250	117251	117251	she	2782	" I never asked you to do anything base , "
117261	117282	117251	117251	she	2782	" If I 'm not clever about throwing myself into things it 's all the more reason you should be . "
117283	117295	117296	117296	Nick	224	" If you 're not clever , my dear Julia - ? "
117319	117331	117296	117296	Nick	224	" You 're clever enough to make me furious , sometimes ! "
117350	117417	117343	117343	she	2782	" All I want is that when a man like Mr. Macgeorge talks to you you should n't appear bored to death . You used to be so charming under those inflictions . Now you appear to take no interest in anything . At dinner to - night you scarcely opened your lips ; you treated them all as if you only wished they 'd go . "
117418	117441	117346	117346	his	224	" I did wish they 'd go . Have n't I told you a hundred times what I think of your salon ? "
117442	117452	117453	117453	she	2783	" How then do you want me to live ? "
117456	117468	117453	117453	she	2783	" Am I not to have a creature in the house ? "
117469	117529	117346	117346	his	224	" As many creatures as you like . Your freedom 's complete and , as far as I 'm concerned , always will be . Only when you challenge me and overhaul me - not justly , I think - I must confess the simple truth , that there are many of your friends I do n't delight in . "
117530	117538	117539	117539	Julia	138	" Oh your idea of pleasant people ! "
117542	117556	117539	117539	Julia	138	" I should like once for all to know what it really is . "
117557	117582	117346	117346	his	224	" I can tell you what it really is n't : it is n't Mr. Macgeorge . He 's a being almost grotesquely limited . "
117583	117597	117539	117539	Julia	138	" He 'll be where you 'll never be - unless you change . "
117598	117619	117620	117620	Nick	224	" To be where Mr. Macgeorge is not would be very much my desire . Therefore why should I change ? "
117623	117646	117647	117647	he	224	" However , I had n't the least intention of being rude to him , and I do n't think I was , "
117651	117678	117647	117647	he	224	" To the best of my ability I assume a virtue if I have n't it ; but apparently I 'm not enough of a comedian . "
117679	117686	117687	117687	she	2784	" If you have n't it ? "
117690	117720	117687	117687	she	2784	" It 's when you say things like that that you 're so dreadfully tiresome . As if there were anything that you have n't or might n't have ! "
117760	117782	117783	117783	He	224	" It 's rather hard to be found so wanting when one has tried to play one 's part so beautifully . "
117802	117911	117799	117799	his	224	" I 've imperilled my immortal soul , or at least bemuddled my intelligence , by all the things I do n't care for that I 've tried to do , and all the things I detest that I 've tried to be , and all the things I never can be that I 've tried to look as if I were - all the appearances and imitations , the pretences and hypocrisies in which I 've steeped myself to the eyes ; and at the end of it it serves me right ! my reward is simply to learn that I 'm still not half humbug enough ! "
117939	117963	117926	117926	she	138	" I 'm very sorry , but I think you had better go . I do n't like you to stay after midnight . "
117964	117992	117993	117995	the young man	445	" Ah what you like and what you do n't like , and where one begins and the other ends - all that 's an impenetrable mystery ! "
118017	118050	117999	117999	he	445	" ' A man like Mr. Macgeorge ' ! When you say a thing of that sort in a certain , particular way I should rather like to suffer you to perish . "
118070	118094	118063	118063	she	166	" How can I help it if a few years hence he 's certain to be at the head of any Liberal Government ? "
118095	118112	118113	118113	Nick	224	" We ca n't help it of course , but we can help talking about it , "
118116	118129	118113	118113	Nick	224	" If we do n't mention it it may n't be noticed . "
118130	118148	118149	118149	she	138	" You 're trying to make me angry . You 're in one of your vicious moods , "
118163	118208	118113	118113	Nick	224	" That I 'm exasperated I 've already had the honour very positively to inform you . All the same I maintain that I was irreproachable at dinner . I do n't want you to think I shall always be as good as that . "
118209	118253	118254	118254	she	138	" You looked so out of it ; you were as gloomy as if every earthly hope had left you , and you did n't make a single contribution to any discussion that took place . Do n't you think I observe you ? "
118266	118276	118277	118277	Nick	224	" Ah my darling , what you observe - ! "
118303	118314	118287	118287	he	224	" You probe me to the bottom , no doubt . "
118315	118333	118287	118287	he	224	" You need n't come either to Griffin or to Severals if you do n't want to . "
118334	118345	118287	118287	he	224	" Give them up yourself ; stay here with me ! "
118358	118367	118346	118346	She	138	" Lord , how you hate political houses ! "
118368	118387	118287	118287	he	224	" How can you say that when from February to August I spend every blessed night in one ? "
118388	118398	118346	118346	She	138	" Yes , and hate that worst of all . "
118399	118440	118441	118441	Nick	224	" So do half the people who are in it . You , my dear , must have so many things , so many people , so much mise - en - scene and such a perpetual spectacle to live , "
118445	118527	118441	118441	Nick	224	" Perpetual motion , perpetual visits , perpetual crowds ! If you go into the country you 'll see forty people every day and be mixed up with them all day . The idea of a quiet fortnight in town , when by a happy if idiotic superstition everybody goes out of it , disconcerts and frightens you . It 's the very time , it 's the very place , to do a little work and possess one 's soul . "
118562	118579	118538	118538	she	2787	" Work ? What work can you do in London at such a moment as this ? "
118583	118618	118580	118580	Nick	224	" I might tell you I want to get up a lot of subjects , to sit at home and read blue - books ; but that would n't be quite what I mean . "
118619	118628	118538	118538	she	2787	" Do you mean you want to paint ? "
118629	118644	118580	118580	Nick	224	" Yes , that 's it , since you gouge it out of me . "
118645	118662	118663	118663	Julia	138	" Why do you make such a mystery about it ? You 're at perfect liberty , "
118696	118738	118693	118693	his	505	" You 're delightful , Julia , when you speak in that tone - then I know why it is I love you . But I ca n't do anything if I go to Griffin , if I go to Severals . "
118739	118746	118747	118747	she	138	" I see - I see , "
118753	118795	118693	118693	his	505	" I 've scarcely been inside of my studio for months , and I feel quite homesick for it . The idea of putting in a few quiet days there has taken hold of me : I rather cling to it . "
118796	118806	118807	118807	Julia	138	" It seems so odd your having a studio ! "
118820	118912	118913	118913	Nick	224	" Does n't it sound absurd , for all the good it does me , or I do in it ? Of course one can produce nothing but rubbish on such terms - without continuity or persistence , with just a few days here and there . I ought to be ashamed of myself , no doubt ; but even my rubbish interests me . ' Guenille si l'on veut , ma guenille m'est chere . ' But I 'll go down to Harsh with you in a moment , Julia , "
118916	118965	118913	118913	Nick	224	" that would do as well if we could be quiet there , without people , without a creature ; and I should really be perfectly content . You 'd beautifully sit for me ; it would be the occasion we 've so often wanted and never found . "
118982	119000	118966	118966	She	138	" Thank you , my dear ; nothing would induce me to go to Harsh with you . "
119007	119029	119001	119001	He	224	" What 's the matter whenever it 's a question of anything of that sort ? Are you afraid of me ? "
119046	119139	119042	119042	he	224	" Stay with me here then , when everything 's so right for it . We shall do beautifully - have the whole place , have the whole day , to ourselves . Hang your engagements ! Telegraph you wo n't come . We 'll live at the studio - you 'll sit to me every day . Now or never 's our chance - when shall we have so good a one ? Think how charming it will be ! I 'll make you wish awfully that I may do something . "
119140	119153	119154	119154	Julia	138	" I ca n't get out of Griffin - it 's impossible , "
119168	119178	119162	119162	her	138	" Then you are afraid of me - simply ! "
119187	119200	119179	119179	She	138	" Of course I am . You 're welcome to know it . "
119249	119309	119242	119242	he	224	" Put an end , Julia , to our absurd situation - it really ca n't go on . You 've no right to expect a man to be happy or comfortable in so false a position . We 're spoken of odiously - of that we may be sure ; and yet what good have we of it ? "
119310	119320	119201	119201	He	224	" Spoken of ? Do I care for that ? "
119321	119342	119242	119242	he	224	" Do you mean you 're indifferent because there are no grounds ? That 's just why I hate it . "
119343	119354	119355	119355	she	138	" I do n't know what you 're talking about ! "
119361	119387	119242	119242	he	224	" Be my wife to - morrow - be my wife next week . Let us have done with this fantastic probation and be happy . "
119388	119405	119406	119406	She	138	" Leave me now - come back to - morrow . I 'll write to you . "
119422	119441	119442	119442	Nick	224	" You ca n't resign yourself to the idea of one 's looking ' out of it ' ! "
119445	119454	119455	119455	she	138	" Come to - morrow , before lunch , "
119459	119483	119484	119486	the young man	445	" To be told I must wait six months more and then be sent about my business ? Ah , Julia , Julia ! "
119512	119519	119520	119520	she	138	" You shall wait no longer , "
119527	119536	119484	119486	the young man	445	" What do you mean by no longer ? "
119537	119550	119484	119486	the young man	445	" Give me about five weeks - say till the Whitsuntide recess . "
119551	119559	119561	119561	Nick	224	" Five weeks are a great deal , "
119563	119576	119484	119486	the young man	445	" There are things to be done - you ought to understand . "
119577	119586	119484	119486	the young man	445	" I only understand how I love you . "
119592	119596	119587	119587	She	138	" Dearest Nick ! "
119609	119623	119624	119624	he	224	" I 've your promise then for five weeks hence to a day ? "
119633	119659	119627	119627	she	138	" We 'll settle that - the exact day ; there are things to consider and to arrange . Come to luncheon to - morrow . "
119660	119672	119673	119673	he	224	" I 'll come early - I 'll come at one , "
119691	119705	119706	119706	she	138	" Do you think I want to wait , any more than you ? "
119713	119725	119726	119726	he	224	" I do n't feel so much out of it now ! "
119733	119748	119726	119726	he	224	" You 'll stay of course now - you 'll give up your visits ? "
119796	119825	119793	119793	she	138	" I 've a better idea - you need n't come to Griffin . Stay in your studio - do as you like - paint dozens of pictures . "
119826	119831	119832	119832	Nick	263	" Dozens ? Barbarian ! "
119873	119897	119869	119869	her	138	" What on earth do I want but that you should do absolutely as you please and be as happy as you can ? "
119914	119922	119908	119908	he	224	" What dreadful proposition is coming now ? "
119923	119937	119908	119908	he	224	" I 'll go off and do up my visits and come back . "
119938	119944	119908	119908	he	224	" And leave me alone ? "
119945	119977	119908	119908	he	224	" Do n't be affected ! You know you 'll work much better without me . You 'll live in your studio - I shall be well out of the way . "
119978	119995	119908	119908	he	224	" That 's not what one wants of a sitter . How can I paint you ? "
119996	120015	119908	119908	he	224	" You can paint me all the rest of your life . I shall be a perpetual sitter . "
120016	120027	120030	120030	his	2793	" I believe I could paint you without looking at you "
120038	120049	120030	120030	his	2793	" You do excuse me then from those dreary places ? "
120050	120067	120068	120068	she	2794	" How can I insist after what you said about the pleasure of keeping these days ? "
120079	120106	120030	120030	his	2793	" You 're the best woman on earth - though it does seem odd you should rush away as soon as our little business is settled . "
120107	120125	120126	120126	She	2794	" We shall make it up . I know what I 'm about . And now go ! "
120676	120678	120666	120666	she	132	" nag "

122187	122197	122174	122174	Nash	147	" I say - I say - I say ! "
122206	122214	122198	122198	He	263	" They 're pretty bad , eh ? "
122215	122223	122224	122224	Nash	147	" Oh you 're a deep one , "
122228	122234	122224	122224	Nash	147	" What 's the matter ? "
122235	122248	122224	122224	Nash	147	" Do you call your conduct that of a man of honour ? "
122249	122262	122224	122224	Nash	147	" Scarcely perhaps . But when no one has seen them - ! "
122263	122294	122296	122297	Gabriel Nash	147	" That 's your villainy . C'est de l'exquis , du pur exquis . Come , my dear fellow , this is very serious - it 's a bad business , "
122306	122332	122300	122300	he	147	" You 'll be so good as to place before me every patch of paint , every sketch and scrap , that this room contains . "
122370	122689	122340	122340	He	224	" He was modest and docile and patient and amused , above all he was quite thrilled - thrilled with the idea of eliciting a note of appreciation so late in the day . It was the oddest thing how he at present in fact found himself imputing value to his visitor - attributing to him , among attributions more confused , the dignity of judgement , the authority of knowledge . Nash was an ambiguous character but an excellent touchstone . The two said very little for a while , and they had almost half an hour 's silence , during which , after our young man had hastily improvised an exhibition , there was only a puffing of cigarettes . Gabriel walked about , looking at this and that , taking up rough studies and laying them down , asking a question of fact , fishing with his umbrella , on the floor , amid a pile of unarranged sketches . Nick accepted jocosely the attitude of suspense , but there was even more of it in his heart than in his face . So few people had seen his young work - almost no one who really counted . He had been ashamed of it , never showing it to bring on a conclusion , since a conclusion was precisely what he feared . He whistled now while he let his companion take time . He rubbed old panels with his sleeve and dabbed wet sponges on surfaces that had sunk . It was a long time since he had felt so gay , strange as such an assertion sounds in regard to a young man whose bridal - day had at his urgent solicitation lately been fixed . He had stayed in town to be alone with his imagination , and suddenly , paradoxically , the sense of that result had arrived with poor Nash .

122701	122715	122695	122696	this personage	643	" for grossness of immorality I think I 've never seen your equal . "
122716	122722	122723	122723	Nick	224	" That sounds so well , "
122726	122739	122723	122723	Nick	224	" that I hesitate to risk spoiling it by wishing it explained . "
122740	122754	122340	122340	He	224	" Do n't you recognise in any degree the grand idea of duty ? "
122755	122781	122782	122782	Nick	224	" If I do n't grasp it with a certain firmness I 'm a deadly failure , for I was quite brought up on it , "
122785	122803	122340	122340	He	224	" Then you 're indeed the wretchedest failure I know . Life is ugly , after all . "
122804	122820	122340	122340	He	224	" Do I gather that you yourself recognise obligations of the order you allude to ? "
122821	122828	122829	122829	Nash	147	" Do you ' gather ' ? "
122832	122851	122829	122829	Nash	147	" Why , are n't they the very flame of my faith , the burden of my song ? "
122852	122880	122340	122340	He	224	" My dear fellow , duty is doing , and I 've inferred that you think rather poorly of doing - that it spoils one 's style . "
122881	122887	122829	122829	Nash	147	" Doing wrong , assuredly . "
122888	122904	122905	122905	Nick	224	" But what do you call right ? What 's your canon of certainty there ? "
122908	123003	122829	122829	Nash	147	" The conscience that 's in us - that charming , conversible , infinite thing , the intensest thing we know . But you must treat the oracle civilly if you wish to make it speak . You must n't stride into the temple in muddy jack - boots and with your hat on your head , as the Puritan troopers tramped into the dear old abbeys . One must do one 's best to find out the right , and your criminality appears to be that you 've not taken the commonest trouble . "
123004	123012	123014	123014	Nick	224	" I had n't you to ask , "
123016	123044	123014	123014	Nick	224	" But duty strikes me as doing something in particular . If you 're too afraid it may be the wrong thing you may let everything go . "
123045	123063	122829	122829	Nash	147	" Being is doing , and if doing is duty being is duty . Do you follow ? "
123064	123071	123014	123014	Nick	224	" At a very great distance . "
123072	123084	123085	123085	Nash	147	" To be what one may be , really and efficaciously , "
123089	123115	123085	123085	Nash	147	" to feel it and understand it , to accept it , adopt it , embrace it - that 's conduct , that 's life . "
123116	123132	123014	123014	Nick	224	" And suppose one 's a brute or an ass , where 's the efficacy ? "
123133	123174	123085	123085	Nash	147	" In one 's very want of intelligence . In such cases one 's out of it - the question does n't exist ; one simply becomes a part of the duty of others . The brute , the ass , "
123180	123277	123085	123085	Nash	147	" neither feels nor understands , nor accepts nor adopts . Those fine processes in themselves classify us . They educate , they exalt , they preserve ; so that to profit by them we must be as perceptive as we can . We must recognise our particular form , the instrument that each of us - each of us who carries anything - carries in his being . Mastering this instrument , learning to play it in perfection - that 's what I call duty , what I call conduct , what I call success . "
123297	123308	123294	123294	he	224	" Every one has it then , this individual pipe ? "
123309	123389	123294	123294	he	224	" ' Every one , ' my dear fellow , is too much to say , for the world 's full of the crudest remplissage . The book of life 's padded , ah but padded - a deplorable want of editing ! I speak of every one who 's any one . Of course there are pipes and pipes - little quavering flutes for the concerted movements and big cornets - a - piston for the great solos . "
123390	123404	123294	123294	he	224	" I see , I see . And what might your instrument be ? "
123417	123440	123411	123411	his	147	" To speak to people just as I 'm speaking to you . To prevent for instance a great wrong being done . "
123441	123447	123294	123294	he	224	" A great wrong - ? "
123448	123482	123483	123483	Gabriel	147	" Yes - to the human race . I talk - I talk ; I say the things other people do n't , the things they ca n't the things they wo n't , "
123491	123506	123507	123508	his companion	647	" If it 's a question of mastery and perfection you certainly have them , "
123511	123611	123483	123483	Gabriel	147	" And you have n't , alas ; that 's the pity of it , that 's the scandal . That 's the wrong I want to set right before it becomes too public a shame . If I called you just now grossly immoral it 's on account of the spectacle you present - a spectacle to be hidden from the eye of ingenuous youth : that of a man neglecting his own fiddle to blunder away on that of one of his fellows . We ca n't afford such mistakes , we ca n't tolerate such licence . "
123612	123621	123624	123626	our young man	528	" You think then I have a fiddle ? "
123654	123680	123712	123712	he	224	" A regular Stradivarius ! All these things you 've shown me are remarkably interesting . You 've a talent of a wonderfully pure strain . "
123681	123691	123692	123692	Nick	224	" I say - I say - I say ! "
123728	123749	123750	123751	that critic	2857	" I like it , your talent ; I measure it , I appreciate it , I insist upon it , "
123761	123800	123801	123801	he	2857	" I have to be awfully wise and good to do so , but fortunately I am . In such a case that 's my duty . I shall make you my business for a while . Therefore , "
123805	123817	123801	123801	he	2857	" do n't say I 'm unconscious of the moral law . "
123818	123822	123824	123824	Nick	224	" A Stradivarius ? "
123954	123958	123972	123972	his	224	" really going in "
124087	124098	124082	124082	Nash	147	" Oh I had n't been in this place then ! "
124154	124166	124144	124144	his	147	" The fact is I have n't the nerve for it . "
124287	124292	124294	124294	Nick	224	" There it is , "
124298	124446	124294	124294	Nick	224	" there 's the naked , preposterous truth : that if I were to do exactly as I liked I should spend my years reproducing the more or less vacuous countenances of my fellow - mortals . I should find peace and pleasure and wisdom and worth , I should find fascination and a measure of success in it - out of the din and the dust and the scramble , the world of party labels , party cries , party bargains and party treacheries : of humbuggery , hypocrisy and ca nt . The cleanness and quietness of it , the independent effort to do something , to leave something which shall give joy to man long after the howling has died away to the last ghost of an echo - such a vision solicits me in the watches of night with an almost irresistible force . "
124495	124499	124500	124500	Nash	147	" You speak , "
124503	124563	124500	124500	Nash	147	" with the special and dreadful eloquence that rises to a man 's lips when he has practically , whatever his theory may be , renounced the right and dropped hideously into the wrong . Then his regret for the right , a certain exquisite appreciation of it , puts on an accent I know well how to recognise . "
124572	124597	124564	124564	Nick	224	" You 've hit it if you mean by that that I have n't resigned my seat and that I do n't intend to . "
124598	124619	124564	124564	Nick	224	" I thought you took it only to give it up . Do n't you remember our talk in Paris ? "
124620	124634	124635	124635	Nick	224	" I like to be a part of the spectacle that amuses you , "
124638	124653	124635	124635	Nick	224	" but I could scarcely have taken so much trouble as that for it . "
124654	124668	124564	124564	Nick	224	" Is n't it then an absurd comedy , the life you lead ? "
124669	124697	124635	124635	Nick	224	" Comedy or tragedy - I do n't know which ; whatever it is I appear to be capable of it to please two or three people . "
124698	124705	124707	124707	Nash	147	" Then you can take trouble ? "
124709	124720	124635	124635	Nick	224	" Yes , for the woman I 'm to marry . "
124721	124728	124635	124635	Nick	224	" Oh you 're to marry ? "
124729	124742	124743	124743	Nick	224	" That 's what has come on since we met in Paris , "
124746	124754	124743	124743	Nick	224	" and it makes just the difference . "
124755	124761	124763	124763	Gabriel	147	" Ah my poor friend , "
124768	124779	124763	124763	Gabriel	147	" no wonder you 've an eloquence , an accent ! "
124780	124805	124635	124635	Nick	224	" It 's a pity I have them in the wrong place . I 'm expected to have them in the House of Commons . "
124806	124838	124839	124840	the visitor	2163	" You will when you make your farewell speech there - to announce that you chuck it up . And may I venture to ask who 's to be your wife ? "
124843	124862	124743	124743	Nick	224	" Mrs. Dallow has kindly consented to accept that yoke . I think you saw her in Paris . "
124863	124889	124635	124635	Nick	224	" Ah yes : you spoke of her to me , and I remember asking you even then if you were in love with her . "
124890	124896	124898	124898	Nick	224	" I was n't then , "
124906	124912	124900	124900	Nash	147	" And are you now ? "
124913	124919	124635	124635	Nick	224	" Oh dear , yes . "
124920	124932	124900	124900	Nash	147	" That would be better - if it was n't worse . "
124933	124939	124940	124940	Nick	224	" Nothing could be better , "
124943	124955	124940	124940	Nick	224	" It 's the best thing that can happen to me . "
124956	124959	124960	124961	his friend	610	" Well , "
124964	124983	124960	124961	his friend	610	" you must let me very respectfully approach this lady . You must let me bring her round . "
124984	124991	124940	124940	Nick	224	" Bring her round to what ? "
124992	125000	124960	124961	his friend	610	" To everything . Talk her over . "
125001	125006	124940	124940	Nick	224	" Talk her under ! "
125113	125125	125126	125126	Nash	147	" Over to a proper pride in what you may do , "
125129	125142	125126	125126	Nash	147	" what you may do above all if she 'll help you . "
125143	125153	125155	125155	Nick	224	" I scarcely see how she can help me , "
125162	125180	125155	125155	Nick	224	" She 's extremely handsome as I remember her . You could do great things with her . "
125181	125189	125190	125190	Nick	224	" Ah , there 's the rub , "
125194	125213	125190	125190	Nick	224	" I wanted her to sit for me this week , but she would n't hear of it . "
125214	125234	125235	125235	Nash	147	" Elle a bien tort . You should attack some fine strong type . Is Mrs. Dallow in London ? "
125238	125251	125155	125155	Nick	224	" For what do you take her ? She 's paying visits . "
125252	125261	125190	125190	Nick	224	" Then I 've a model for you . "
125262	125268	125269	125269	Nick	224	" Then you have - ? "
125272	125285	125269	125269	Nick	224	" What has that to do with Mrs. Dallow 's being away ? "
125286	125295	125190	125190	Nick	224	" Does n't it give you more time ? "
125296	125302	125304	125304	Nick	224	" Oh the time flies ! "
125329	125337	125338	125339	that personage	2874	" Does she like you to paint ? "
125348	125353	125304	125304	Nick	224	" So she says . "
125354	125364	125338	125339	that personage	2874	" Well , do something fine to show her . "
125365	125374	125375	125375	Nick	224	" I 'd rather show it to you , "
125378	125402	125403	125403	Nash	147	" My dear fellow , I see it from here - if you do your duty . Do you remember the Tragic Muse ? "
125408	125413	125338	125339	that personage	2874	" The Tragic Muse ? "
125414	125450	125338	125339	that personage	2874	" That girl in Paris , whom we heard at the old actress 's and afterwards met at the charming entertainment given by your cousin - is n't he ? - the secretary of embassy . "
125451	125463	125338	125339	that personage	2874	" Oh Peter 's girl ! Of course I remember her . "
125464	125477	125478	125478	Nash	147	" Do n't call her Peter 's ; call her rather mine , "
125484	125497	125478	125478	Nash	147	" I invented her . I introduced her . I revealed her . "
125498	125510	125338	125339	that personage	2874	" I thought you on the contrary ridiculed and repudiated her . "
125511	125568	125478	125478	Nash	147	" As a fine , handsome young woman surely not - I seem to myself to have been all the while rendering her services . I said I disliked tea - party ranters , and so I do ; but if my estimate of her powers was below the mark she has more than punished me . "
125569	125575	125576	125576	Nick	224	" What has she done ? "
125579	125591	125478	125478	Nash	147	" She has become interesting , as I suppose you know . "
125592	125598	125478	125478	Nash	147	" How should I know ? "
125599	125612	125613	125613	Nash	147	" Well , you must see her , you must paint her , "
125616	125632	125613	125613	Nash	147	" She tells me something was said about it that day at Madame CarrĂ ' s. "
125633	125642	125478	125478	Nash	147	" Oh I remember - said by Peter . "
125643	125670	125671	125671	Gabriel	147	" Then it will please Mr. Sherringham - you 'll be glad to do that . I suppose you know all he has done for Miriam ? "
125674	125687	125688	125688	Nick	224	" Not a bit , I know nothing about Peter 's affairs , "
125691	125735	125688	125688	Nick	224	" unless it be in general that he goes in for mountebanks and mimes and that it occurs to me I 've heard one of my sisters mention - the rumour had come to her - that he has been backing Miss Rooth . "
125736	125768	125478	125478	Nash	147	" Miss Rooth delights to talk of his kindness ; she 's charming when she speaks of it . It 's to his good offices that she owes her appearance here . "
125769	125772	125773	125773	Nick	224	" Here ? "
125778	125784	125773	125773	Nick	224	" Is she in London ? "
125785	125799	125478	125478	Nash	147	" D'ou tombez - vous ? I thought you people read the papers . "
125800	125820	125773	125773	Nick	224	" What should I read , when I sit - sometimes - through the stuff they put into them ? "
125821	125856	125858	125859	Gabriel Nash	147	" Of course I see that - that your engagement at your own variety - show , with its interminable ' turns , ' keeps you from going to the others . Learn then , "
125861	125913	125858	125859	Gabriel Nash	147	" that you 've a great competitor and that you 're distinctly not , much as you may suppose it , the rising comedian . The Tragic Muse is the great modern personage . Have n't you heard people speak of her , have n't you been taken to see her ? "
125918	125942	125916	125916	himself	224	" I daresay I 've heard of her , but with a good many other things on my mind I had forgotten it . "
125943	125971	125973	125973	Nash	147	" Certainly I can imagine what has been on your mind . She remembers you at any rate ; she repays neglect with sympathy . She wants , "
125975	125982	125973	125973	Nash	147	" to come and see you . "
125983	125989	125916	125916	himself	224	" ' See ' me ? "
125999	126051	125973	125973	Nash	147	" To be seen by you - it comes to the same thing . She 's really worth seeing ; you must let me bring her ; you 'll find her very suggestive . That idea that you should paint her - she appears to consider it a sort of bargain . "
126052	126056	126057	126059	Our young man	528	" A bargain ? "
126073	126080	125973	125973	Nash	147	" What will she give me ? "
126081	126090	126057	126059	Our young man	528	" A splendid model . She is splendid . "
126091	126097	126099	126099	Nick	224	" Oh then bring her , "
126277	126352	126374	126374	Nash	147	" side . Miss Rooth was light and bright and direct to - day - direct without being stiff and bright without being garish . To Nick 's perhaps inadequately sophisticated mind the model , the actress were figures of a vulgar setting ; but it would have been impossible to show that taint less than this extremely natural yet extremely distinguished aspirant to distinction . She was more natural even than Gabriel Nash - "
126354	126373	126374	126374	Nash	147	" was still Nick 's formula for his amusing old friend - and beside her he appeared almost commonplace .
126581	126596	126597	126597	Nash	147	" She 's a woman of the best intentions , really of the best , "
126606	126618	126597	126597	Nash	147	" and the quite rare head you can see for yourself . "
126690	126700	126701	126702	the girl	481	" When I take him she has perfect peace , "
126705	126879	126701	126702	the girl	481	" then she can stay at home and see the interviewers . She delights in that and I hate it , so our friend here is a great comfort . Of course a femme de thĂ Ă tre is supposed to be able to go out alone , but there 's a kind of ' smartness , ' an added chic , in having some one . People think he 's my ' companion ' ; I 'm sure they fancy I pay him . I 'd pay him , if he 'd take it - and perhaps he will yet ! - rather than give him up , for it does n't matter that he 's not a lady . He is one in tact and sympathy , as you see . And base as he thinks the sort of thing I do he ca n't keep away from the theatre . When you 're celebrated people will look at you who could never before find out for themselves why they should . "
126880	126907	126908	126908	Gabriel	147	" When you 're celebrated you grow handsomer ; at least that 's what has happened to you , though you were pretty too of old , "
126912	126954	126908	126908	Gabriel	147	" I go to the theatre to look at your head ; it gives me the greatest pleasure . I take up anything of that sort as soon as I find it . One never knows how long it may last . "
126955	126965	126966	126966	Miriam	170	" Are you attributing that uncertainty to my appearance ? "
126970	126986	126987	126987	Nash	147	" Dear no , to my own pleasure , the first precious bloom of it , "
126991	127049	126987	126987	Nash	147	" Dormer at least , let me tell you in justice to him , has n't waited till you were celebrated to want to see you again - he stands there open - eyed - for the simple reason that he had n't the least idea of your renown . I had to announce it to him . "
127050	127058	127059	127059	Miriam	170	" Have n't you seen me act ? "
127069	127077	127078	127078	he	1317	" I 'll go to - night , "
127082	127105	127106	127106	Miriam	170	" You have your terrible House , have n't you ? What do they call it - the demands of public life ? "
127153	127197	127150	127150	she	170	" Ah then do bring your - what do they call her in English ? I 'm always afraid of saying something improper - your future . I 'll send you a box , under the circumstances ; you 'll like that better . "
127311	127332	127333	127333	Nash	147	" That 's the fine artistic nature , you see - a sort of divine disgust breaking out in her , "
127336	127365	127366	127367	the girl	481	" If you want to paint me ' at all at all ' of course . I 'm struck with the way I 'm taking that for granted , "
127371	127422	127366	127367	the girl	481	" When Mr. Nash spoke of it to me I jumped at the idea . I remembered our meeting in Paris and the kind things you said to me . But no doubt one ought n't to jump at ideas when they represent serious sacrifices on the part of others . "
127423	127430	127431	127431	Nash	147	" Does n't she speak well ? "
127436	127443	127431	127431	Nash	147	" Oh she 'll go far ! "
127444	127470	127471	127471	Nick	224	" It 's a great privilege to me to paint you : what title in the world have I to pretend to such a model ? "
127476	127540	127471	127471	Nick	224	" The sacrifice is yours - a sacrifice of time and good nature and credulity . You come , in your bright beauty and your genius , to this shabby place where I 've nothing worth speaking of to show , not a guarantee to offer you ; and I wonder what I 've done to deserve such a gift of the gods . "
127541	127548	127551	127551	Nash	147	" Does n't he speak well ? "
127614	127627	127592	127592	she	170	" Ah well , if I must justify myself I liked you ! "
127628	127636	127638	127638	Nick	224	" Fancy my appearing to challenge you ! "
127642	127670	127638	127638	Nick	224	" To see you again is to want tremendously to try something . But you must have an infinite patience , because I 'm an awful duffer . "
127677	127689	127671	127671	She	170	" I see what you 've done - bien des choses . "
127690	127697	127698	127698	Gabriel	147	" She understands - she understands , "
127708	127736	127702	127702	he	147	" Imagine , when he might do something , his choosing a life of shams ! At bottom he 's like you - a wonderful artistic nature . "
127737	127743	127745	127746	the girl	481	" I 'll have patience , "
127752	127771	127775	127775	Nash	147	" Then , my children , I leave you - the peace of the Lord be with you . "
127823	127828	127830	127830	he	224	" knock her in , "
127885	127887	127878	127878	he	224	" art "
128132	128134	128121	128121	her	170	" do "
128210	128214	128187	128187	he	224	" knocking her in "
128560	128586	128588	128588	she	170	" Oh dear no , only the tiresome photographers ; and fancy them in the future . If mamma could only do that for me ! "
128603	128624	128588	128588	she	170	" You know I do n't think any one yet has been quite so much struck with me as you . "
128625	128631	128636	128636	he	1317	" Not even Peter Sherringham ? "
128648	128660	128588	128588	she	170	" Oh Mr. Sherringham 's different . You 're an artist . "
128661	128671	128672	128672	he	1317	" For pity 's sake do n't say that ! "
128675	128690	128672	128672	he	1317	" And as regards your art I thought Peter knew more than any one . "
128691	128697	128699	128699	Miriam	170	" Ah you 're severe , "
128701	128705	128588	128588	she	170	" Severe - ? "
128706	128731	128588	128588	she	170	" Because that 's what the poor dear thinks . But he does know a lot - he has been a providence to me . "
128732	128745	128588	128588	she	170	" Then why has n't he come over to see you act ? "
128751	128761	128746	128746	She	170	" How do you know he has n't come ? "
128762	128778	128588	128588	she	170	" Because I take for granted he 'd have called on me if he had . "
128779	128787	128788	128789	the girl	481	" Does he like you very much ? "
128792	128802	128588	128588	she	170	" I do n't know . I like him . "
128803	128812	128813	128813	she	481	" He 's a gentleman - pour cela , "
128816	128823	128824	128824	Nick	224	" Oh yes , for that ! "
128832	128845	128588	128588	she	170	" But he 's afraid of me - afraid to see me . "
128846	128855	128588	128588	she	170	" Does n't he think you good enough ? "
128856	128879	128588	128588	she	170	" On the contrary - he believes I shall carry him away and he 's in a terror of my doing it . "
128880	128887	128889	128889	Nick	224	" He ought to like that , "
128894	128966	128967	128967	she	2914	" That 's what I mean when I say he 's not an artist . However , he declares he does like it , only it appears to be not the right thing for him . Oh the right thing - he 's ravenous for that . But it 's not for me to blame him , since I am too . He 's coming some night , however . Then , "
128972	128979	128967	128967	she	2914	" he shall have a dose . "
128980	128984	128985	128985	Nick	224	" Poor Peter ! "
129011	129019	129020	129020	she	2914	" He 's such a curious mixture , "
129086	129086	129078	129078	one	423	"
129087	129097	129098	129098	Nick	224	" Brava , brava ! you do me good , "
129110	129147	129148	129148	he	224	" But it 's very kind of you , when I was in this absurd state of ignorance , to impute to me the honour of having been more struck with you than any one else , "
129154	129174	129148	129148	he	224	" Yes , I confess I do n't quite see - when the shops were full of my photographs . "
129175	129189	129190	129190	he	224	" Oh I 'm so poor - I do n't go into shops , "
129193	129199	129148	129148	he	224	" Are you very poor ? "
129200	129206	129148	129148	he	224	" I live on alms . "
129207	129221	129148	129148	he	224	" And do n't they pay you - the government , the ministry ? "
129222	129239	129148	129148	he	224	" Dear young lady , for what ? - for shutting myself up with beautiful women ? "
129240	129247	129248	129248	she	2921	" Ah you 've others then ? "
129252	129264	129148	129148	he	224	" They 're not so kind as you , I confess . "
129265	129288	129290	129291	the girl	481	" I 'll buy it from you - what you 're doing : I 'll pay you well when it 's done , "
129293	129337	129290	129291	the girl	481	" I 've got money now . I make it , you know - a good lot of it . It 's too delightful after scraping and starving . Try it and you 'll see . Give up the base , bad world . "
129338	129354	129148	129148	he	224	" But is n't it supposed to be the base , bad world that pays ? "
129355	129523	129290	129291	the girl	481	" Precisely ; make it pay without mercy - knock it silly , squeeze it dry . That 's what it 's meant for - to pay for art . Ah if it was n't for that ! I 'll bring you a quantity of photographs to - morrow - you must let me come back to - morrow : it 's so amusing to have them , by the hundred , all for nothing , to give away . That 's what takes mamma most : she ca n't get over it . That 's luxury and glory ; even at Castle Nugent they did n't do that . People used to sketch me , but not so much as mamma veut bien le dire ; and in all my life I never had but one poor little carte - de - visite , when I was sixteen , in a plaid frock , with the banks of a river , at three francs the dozen . "
130254	130291	130292	130292	she	170	" Oh give me fifty words any time and the ghost of a situation , and I 'll set you up somebody . Besides , I must n't abuse poor Yolande - she has saved us , "
130295	130301	130244	130244	Miriam	170	" ' Yolande ' - ? "
130302	130340	130244	130244	Miriam	170	" Our ridiculous play . That 's the name of the impossible woman . She has put bread into our mouths and she 's a loaf on the shelf for the future . The rights are mine . "
130341	130349	130351	130351	Nick	224	" You 're lucky to have them , "
130372	130388	130244	130244	Miriam	170	" Indeed I am . He gave them to me . Was n't it charming ? "
130389	130399	130244	130244	Miriam	170	" ' He ' gave them - Mr. Dashwood ? "
130400	130442	130244	130244	Miriam	170	" Dear me , no - where should poor Dashwood have got them ? He has n't a penny in the world . Besides , if he had got them he 'd have kept them . I mean your blessed cousin . "
130443	130454	130244	130244	Miriam	170	" I see - they 're a present from Peter . "
130455	130542	130244	130244	Miriam	170	" Like many other things . Is n't he a dear ? If it had n't been for him the shelf would have remained bare . He bought the play for this country and America for four hundred pounds , and on the chance : fancy ! There was no rush for it , and how could he tell ? And then he gracefully pressed it on me . So I 've my little capital . Is n't he a duck ? You 've nice cousins . "
130615	130617	130619	130619	he	224	" duck "
130710	130719	130707	130707	she	170	" Then you will come to - night ? "
130720	130733	130707	130707	she	170	" Without fail . I hate to lose an hour of you . "
130734	130747	130707	130707	she	170	" Then I 'll place you . It will be my affair . "
130748	130753	130755	130755	he	224	" You 're very kind "
130761	130785	130755	130755	he	224	" Is n't it a simple matter for me to take a stall ? This week I suppose they 're to be had . "
130786	130794	130796	130796	Miriam	170	" I 'll send you a box , "
130798	130810	130796	130796	Miriam	170	" You shall do it well . There are plenty now . "
130811	130828	130707	130707	she	170	" Why should I be lost , all alone , in the grandeur of a box ? "
130829	130837	130796	130796	Miriam	170	" Ca n't you bring your friend ? "
130838	130842	130707	130707	she	170	" My friend ? "
130843	130851	130796	130796	Miriam	170	" The lady you 're engaged to . "
130852	130860	130707	130707	she	170	" Unfortunately she 's out of town . "
130870	130879	130861	130861	Miriam	170	" Does she leave you alone like that ? "
130880	130901	130796	130796	Miriam	170	" She thought I should like it - I should be more free to paint . You see I am . "
130902	130918	130919	130919	Miriam	170	" Yes , perhaps it 's good for me . Have you got her portrait ? "
130922	130932	130796	130796	Miriam	170	" She does n't like me to paint her . "
130933	130947	130796	130796	Miriam	170	" Really ? Perhaps then she wo n't like you to paint me . "
130948	130958	130960	130960	Nick	224	" That 's why I want to be quick ! "
130962	130968	130796	130796	Miriam	170	" Before she knows it ? "
130969	130983	130796	130796	Miriam	170	" Shell know it to - morrow . I shall write to her . "
130991	131000	130984	130985	The girl	481	" I see you 're afraid of her . "
131005	131020	131002	131002	she	481	" Mention my name ; they 'll give you the box at the office . "
131084	131091	131092	131092	he	224	" Ah then you have me , "
131097	131112	131092	131092	he	224	" Only I do n't see why you should give me so many things . "
131113	131123	131131	131131	Nick	224	" What in the world have I given you ? "
131124	131129	131092	131092	he	224	" Why an idea . "
131139	131158	131131	131131	Nick	224	" I do n't mean to say though that I have n't let it fall and smashed it . "
131159	131193	131194	131194	She	2953	" Ah an idea - that is a great thing for people in our line . But you 'll see me much better from the box and I 'll send you Gabriel Nash . "
131232	131235	131221	131221	he	224	" line . "
131950	131960	131961	131962	the girl	481	" I 'm acting for you to - night , "
131973	131985	131986	131986	Nash	147	" No , that 's exactly what you 're not doing , "
131995	132044	131986	131986	Nash	147	" You 've stopped acting , you 've reduced it to the least that will do , you simply are - you 're just the visible image , the picture on the wall . It keeps you wonderfully in focus . I 've never seen you so beautiful . "
132059	132076	132077	132077	she	170	" What a luxury in life to have everything explained ! He 's the great explainer , "
132093	132105	132083	132083	He	224	" Well then , we must give him lots to do . "
132129	132141	132125	132125	she	170	" Mamma wished to come but I would n't let her . "
132226	132235	132242	132242	she	2558	" I say , I must see it ! "
132286	132293	132294	132294	she	170	" Ah bien , c'est tapĂ ! "
132509	132520	132504	132504	he	224	" Ah my dear Julia , what a jolly surprise ! "
132705	132716	132692	132692	he	224	" How I should like to paint her that way ! "
132745	132771	132773	132773	he	224	" I 've got a sitter , but you must n't mind that ; we 're taking a rest . I 'm delighted to see you "
132840	132862	132863	132863	he	224	" When did you come back ? I hope nothing has gone wrong . You come at a very interesting moment , "
132922	132934	132913	132913	he	224	" I came back this morning - I came straight here . "
132935	132944	132913	132913	he	224	" And nothing 's wrong , I hope ? "
132945	132954	132955	132955	she	138	" Oh no - everything 's all right , "
133116	133126	133111	133111	He	224	" What 's the difficulty ? Has anything happened ? "
133256	133260	133251	133252	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Ah yes , "
133444	133473	133430	133430	she	3001	" I did n't come to stay - when you 're so busy . I only looked in to see if you were here . Good - bye . "
133474	133499	133500	133500	Nick	224	" It 's charming of you to have come . I 'm so glad you 've seen for yourself how well I 'm occupied , "
133548	133557	133558	133558	he	224	" Of course I 'll see you later , "
133587	133601	133602	133602	he	224	" I wrote to you this morning - you 've missed my letter , "
133687	133696	133697	133697	Nick	224	" Ah my dear , do n't go ! "
133734	133747	133748	133748	Gabriel	147	" I beg a thousand pardons - I thought you were Miriam . "
133965	134008	133956	133956	Nash	147	" You came for a glimpse of the great model ? Does n't she sit ? That 's what I wanted too , this morning - just a look , for a blessing on the day . Ah but you , madam - "
134028	134031	134009	134009	Julia	138	" Home ! "
134076	134088	134089	134089	he	224	" You do n't like it , but I 'll explain , "
134098	134102	134103	134103	she	138	" Explain what ? "
134135	134149	134150	134150	Nick	224	" Oh it 's all right . I 'll come in at five , "
134189	134207	134208	134208	he	224	" Lord , she 's good to - day ! Is n't she good to - day ? "
135073	135078	135053	135053	she	138	" To the Park ! "
135830	135843	135819	135819	she	166	" Certainly , if you 're not too ill to see me . "
135844	135849	135850	135850	Julia	138	" Come in then , "
135997	136010	135991	135991	she	166	" I daresay you saw I did n't like that at all . "
136011	136030	136031	136031	Nick	224	" My having a sitter in that professional way ? I was very much annoyed at it myself , "
136034	136045	136046	136047	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Why were you annoyed ? She 's very handsome , "
136051	136062	136063	136063	Nick	224	" I did n't know you had looked at her ! "
136071	136077	136066	136066	Julia	138	" Was I very rude ? "
136078	136097	136098	136098	he	224	" Oh it was all right ; it was only awkward for me because you did n't know , "
136101	136112	136066	136066	Julia	138	" I did know ; that 's why I came . "
136113	136127	136066	136066	Julia	138	" How do you mean ? My letter could n't have reached you . "
136128	136138	136139	136139	Julia	138	" I do n't know anything about your letter , "
136163	136221	136149	136149	herself	138	" She sat to me yesterday ; she was there all the morning ; but I did n't write to tell you . I went at her with great energy and , absurd as it may seem to you , found myself very tired afterwards . Besides , in the evening I went to see her act . "
136222	136227	136229	136230	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Does she act ? "
136232	136291	136229	136230	Mrs. Dallow	166	" She 's an actress : it 's her profession . Do n't you remember her that day at Peter 's in Paris ? She 's already a celebrity ; she has great talent ; she 's engaged at a theatre here and is making a sensation . As I tell you , I saw her last night . "
136292	136299	136300	136300	Julia	138	" You need n't tell me , "
136342	136434	136435	136435	Nick	224	" I want to , please ; otherwise it must seem so odd to you . I knew she was coming when I wrote to you the day before yesterday . But I did n't tell you then because I did n't know how it would turn out , and I did n't want to exult in advance over a poor little attempt that might come to nothing . Moreover , it was no use speaking of the matter at all unless I told you exactly how it had come about , "
136444	136459	136435	136435	Nick	224	" It was the result of a visit unexpectedly paid me by Gabriel Nash . "
136460	136471	136472	136472	Her	138	" That man - the man who spoke to me ? "
136480	136519	136435	136435	Nick	224	" He did what he thought would please you , but I daresay it did n't . You met him in Paris and did n't like him ; so I judged best to hold my tongue about him . "
136520	136526	136435	136435	Nick	224	" Do you like him ? "
136527	136531	136435	136435	Nick	224	" Very much . "
136532	136536	136537	136537	Julia	138	" Great heaven ! "
136545	136600	136542	136542	her	138	" The reason I was annoyed was because , somehow , when you came in , I suddenly had the air of having got out of those visits and shut myself up in town to do something that I had kept from you . And I have been very unhappy till I could explain . "
136601	136612	136613	136614	Mrs Dallow	166	" You do n't explain - you ca n't explain , "
136635	136650	136613	136614	Mrs Dallow	166	" I knew it - I knew everything ; that 's why I came . "
136651	136667	136668	136668	Nick	224	" It was a sort of second - sight - what they call a brainwave , "
136671	136701	136613	136614	Mrs Dallow	166	" I felt uneasy , I felt a kind of call ; it came suddenly , yesterday . It was irresistible ; nothing could have kept me this morning . "
136702	136722	136724	136724	Nick	224	" That 's very serious , but it 's still more delightful . You must n't go away again , "
136726	136736	136724	136724	Nick	224	" We must stick together - forever and ever . "
136784	136801	136802	136802	she	166	" I 've thought it all over ; I 've been thinking of it all day , "
136805	136815	136802	136802	she	166	" That 's why I did n't come in . "
136816	136831	136851	136851	she	166	" Do n't think of it too much ; it is n't worth it . "
136832	136850	136851	136851	she	166	" You like it more than anything else . You do - you ca n't deny it , "
136855	136866	136867	136867	Nick	224	" My dear child , what are you talking about ? "
136872	136905	136851	136851	she	166	" That 's what you like - doing what you were this morning ; with women lolling , with their things off , to be painted , and people like that man . "
136913	136933	136906	136906	Nick	224	" My dear Julia , apart from the surprise this morning , do you object to the living model ? "
136934	136942	136851	136851	she	166	" Not a bit , for you . "
136943	136960	136906	136906	Nick	224	" What 's the inconvenience then , since in my studio they 're only for me ? "
136961	136983	136984	136984	Julia	138	" You love it , you revel in it ; that 's what you want - the only thing you want ! "
136988	137001	136906	136906	Nick	224	" To have models , lolling undressed women , do you mean ? "
137002	137013	137014	137014	she	138	" That 's what I felt , what I knew , "
137018	137095	137014	137014	she	138	" what came over me and haunted me yesterday so that I could n't throw it off . It seemed to me that if I could see it with my eyes and have the perfect proof I should feel better , I should be quiet . And now I am quiet - after a struggle of some hours , I confess . I have seen ; the whole thing 's before me and I 'm satisfied . "
137096	137122	137123	137123	Nick	224	" I 'm not - to me neither the whole thing nor half of it is before me . What exactly are you talking about ? "
137126	137147	136906	136906	Nick	224	" About what you were doing this morning . That 's your innermost preference , that 's your secret passion . "
137148	137163	137164	137164	he	224	" A feeble scratch at something serious ? Yes , it was almost serious , "
137167	137188	137164	137164	he	224	" But it was an accident , this morning and yesterday : I got on less wretchedly than I intended . "
137189	137198	137199	137199	Julia	138	" I 'm sure you 've immense talent , "
137209	137246	136906	136906	Nick	224	" No , no , I might have had . I 've plucked it up : it 's too late for it to flower . My dear Julia , I 'm perfectly incompetent and perfectly resigned . "
137247	137270	136906	136906	Nick	224	" Yes , you looked so this morning , when you hung over her . Oh she 'll bring back your talent ! "
137271	137293	137294	137294	Nick	224	" She 's an obliging and even an intelligent creature , and I 've no doubt she would if she could , "
137297	137327	137294	137294	Nick	224	" But I 've received from you all the help any woman 's destined to give me . No one can do for me again what you 've done . "
137328	137349	137350	137350	Julia	138	" I should n't try it again ; I acted in ignorance . Oh I 've thought it all out ! "
137366	137379	137350	137350	Julia	138	" Before it 's too late - before it 's too late ! "
137380	137386	137294	137294	Nick	224	" Too late for what ? "
137387	137417	137418	137418	she	138	" For you to be free - for you to be free . And for me - for me to be free too . You hate everything I like ! "
137422	137431	137432	137432	she	138	" Do n't pretend , do n't pretend ! "
137444	137455	137456	137456	he	224	" I thought you so awfully wanted me to paint , "
137463	137483	137432	137432	she	138	" I do - I do . That 's why you must be free , why we must part ? "
137484	137491	137432	137432	she	138	" Why we must part - ? "
137492	137515	137516	137516	Julia	138	" Oh I 've turned it well over . I 've faced the hard truth . It would n't do at all ! "
137520	137540	137541	137541	Nick	224	" I like the way you talk of it - as if it were a trimming for your dress ! "
137546	137566	137541	137541	Nick	224	" Wo n't it do for you to be loved and cherished as well as any woman in England ? "
137583	137618	137567	137567	She	138	" You must n't give anything up for me . I should feel it all the while and I should hate it . I 'm not afraid of the truth , but you are . "
137619	137633	137634	137634	Nick	224	" The truth , dear Julia ? I only want to know it , "
137637	137689	137634	137634	Nick	224	" It seems to me in fact just what I 've got hold of . When two persons are united by the tenderest affection and are sane and generous and just , no difficulties that occur in the union their life makes for them are insurmountable , no problems are insoluble . "
137728	137759	137724	137724	she	138	" I hate art , as you call it . I thought I did , I knew I did ; but till this morning I did n't know how much . "
137760	137771	137772	137772	Nick	224	" Bless your dear soul , that was n't art , "
137775	137817	137772	137772	Nick	224	" The real thing will be a thousand miles away from us ; it will never come into the house , soyez tranquille . It knows where to look in and where to flee shrieking . Why then should you worry ? "
137818	137845	137846	137846	Julia	138	" Because I want to understand , I want to know what I 'm doing . You 're an artist : you are , you are ! "
137853	137924	137772	137772	Nick	224	" My poor Julia , it is n't so easy as that , nor a character one can take on from one day to the other . There are all sorts of things ; one must be caught young and put through the mill - one must see things as they are . There are very few professions that goes with . There would be sacrifices I never can make . "
137925	137981	137982	137982	she	138	" Well then , there are sacrifices for both of us , and I ca n't make them either . I daresay it 's all right for you , but for me it would be a terrible mistake . When I think I 'm doing a certain thing I must n't do just the opposite , "
137990	138042	137982	137982	she	138	" There are things I 've thought of , the things I like best ; and they 're not what you mean . It would be a great deception , and it 's not the way I see my life , and it would be misery if we do n't understand . "
138055	138063	138043	138043	He	3093	" If we do n't understand what ? "
138064	138080	137772	137772	Nick	224	" That we 're utterly different - that you 're doing it all for me . "
138081	138096	138097	138097	he	3093	" And is that an objection to me - what I do for you ? "
138100	138167	138168	138168	Julia	138	" You do too much . You 're awfully good , you 're generous , you 're a dear , oh yes - a dear . But that does n't make me believe in it . I did n't at bottom , from the first - that 's why I made you wait , why I gave you your freedom . Oh I 've suspected you , "
138171	138222	138168	138168	Julia	138	" I had my ideas . It 's all right for you , but it wo n't do for me : I 'm different altogether . Why should it always be put upon me when I hate it ? What have I done ? I was drenched with it before . "
138705	138733	138702	138702	he	224	" You want to be sure the man you marry will be prime minister of England . But how can you be really sure with any one ? "
138734	138745	138746	138746	Julia	138	" I can be really sure some men wo n't ! "
138749	138763	138764	138764	he	224	" The only safe thing perhaps would be to - marry Mr. Macgeorge , "
138767	138773	138746	138746	Julia	138	" Possibly not even him . "
138774	138782	138783	138783	Nick	224	" You 're a prime minister yourself , "
138787	138820	138783	138783	Nick	224	" To hold fast to you as I hold , to be determined to be of your party - is n't that political enough , since you 're the incarnation of politics ? "
138821	138828	138829	138829	she	138	" Ah how you hate them ! "
138833	138852	138829	138829	she	138	" I saw that when I saw you this morning . The whole place reeked of your aversion . "
138853	138881	138783	138783	Nick	224	" My dear child , the greatest statesmen have had their distractions . What do you make of my hereditary talent ? That 's a tremendous force . "
138882	138890	138892	138892	she	138	" It would n't carry you far . "
138896	138904	138892	138892	she	138	" You must be a great artist . "
138921	138961	138917	138917	she	138	" It 's beautiful of you to want to give up anything , and I like you for it . I shall always like you . We shall be friends , and I shall always take an interest - ! "
138994	139002	139003	139003	he	3099	" It is n't only for you , "
139007	139156	139003	139003	he	3099	" you 're a great deal , but you 're not everything . Innumerable vows and pledges repose upon my head . I 'm inextricably committed and dedicated . I was brought up in the temple like an infant Samuel ; my father was a high - priest and I 'm a child of the Lord . And then the life itself - when you speak of it I feel stirred to my depths ; it 's like a herald 's trumpet . Fight with me , Julia - not against me ! Be on my side and we shall do everything . It is uplifting to be a great man before the people - to be loved by them , to be followed by them . An artist is n't - never , never . Why should he be ? Do n't forget how clever I am . "
139157	139166	139167	139167	she	3100	" Oh if it was n't for that ! "
139186	139206	139180	139180	she	3100	" Do you pretend that if I were to die to - morrow you 'd stay in the House ? "
139207	139227	139228	139228	he	3101	" If you were to die ? God knows ! But you do singularly little justice to my incentives , "
139231	139241	139180	139180	she	3100	" My political career 's everything to my mother . "
139251	139259	139245	139245	her	3100	" Are you afraid of your mother ? "
139260	139343	139180	139180	she	3100	" Yes , immensely ; for she represents ever so many possibilities of disappointment and distress . She represents all my father 's as well as all her own , and in them my father tragically lives again . On the other hand I see him in bliss , as I see my mother , over our marriage and our life of common aspirations - though of course that 's not a consideration that I can expect to have power with you . "
139359	139367	139344	139344	She	3100	" You 'll never hold high office . "
139368	139378	139180	139180	she	3100	" But why not take me as I am ? "
139379	139416	139344	139344	She	3100	" Because I 'm abominably keen about that sort of thing - I must recognise my keenness . I must face the ugly truth . I 've been through the worst ; it 's all settled . "
139417	139432	139180	139180	she	3100	" The worst , I suppose , was when you found me this morning . "
139433	139443	139344	139344	She	3100	" Oh that was all right - for you . "
139444	139466	139467	139467	Nick	224	" You 're magnanimous , Julia ; but evidently what 's good enough for me is n't good enough for you . "
139472	139485	139486	139486	she	3100	" I do n't like you enough - that 's the obstacle , "
139494	139506	139344	139344	She	3100	" You did a year ago ; you confessed to it . "
139507	139525	139543	139543	Nick	224	" Well , a year ago was a year ago . Things are changed to - day . "
139526	139542	139543	139543	Nick	224	" You 're very fortunate - to be able to throw away a real devotion , "
139598	139611	139615	139615	she	3100	" Do you mean the devotion I was witness of this morning ? "
139621	139636	139615	139615	she	3100	" I thought I heard a ring . I 've telegraphed for Mrs. Gresham . "
139640	139647	139615	139615	she	3100	" Why did you do that ? "
139648	139654	139684	139684	he	224	" Oh I want her . "
139688	139729	139684	139684	he	224	" Why wo n't you trust me to make you like me , as you call it , better ? If I make you like me as well as I like you it will be about enough , I think . "
139730	139749	139750	139751	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Oh I like you enough for your happiness . And I do n't throw away a devotion , "
139754	139770	139750	139751	Mrs. Dallow	166	" I shall be constantly kind to you . I shall be beautiful to you . "
139771	139780	139781	139781	Nick	224	" You 'll make me lose a fortune , "
139800	139811	139750	139751	Mrs. Dallow	166	" Ah you may have all the money you want ! "
139812	139819	139820	139820	he	224	" I do n't mean yours , "
139854	139884	139846	139846	he	224	" Mr. Carteret last year promised me a pot of money on the day we should be man and wife . He has thoroughly set his heart on it . "
139885	139894	139896	139896	Julia	138	" I 'm sorry to disappoint Mr. Carteret , "
139898	139913	139914	139914	she	138	" I 'll go and see him . I 'll make it all right , "
139918	139943	139914	139914	she	138	" Then your work , you know , will bring you an income . The great men get a thousand just for a head . "
139944	139950	139951	139951	Nick	224	" I 'm only joking , "
139961	139971	139951	139951	Nick	224	" But what things you deserve I should do ! "
139972	139979	139951	139951	Nick	224	" Do you mean striking likenesses ? "
139986	140001	140002	140002	he	224	" You do hate it ! Pushed to that point , it 's curious , "
140006	140019	139951	139951	Nick	224	" Do you mean you 're joking about Mr. Carteret 's promise ? "
140020	140039	139951	139951	Nick	224	" No - the promise is real , but I do n't seriously offer it as a reason . "
140040	140047	140048	140048	Julia	138	" I shall go to Beauclere , "
140051	140058	140059	140059	she	138	" You 're an hour late , "
140091	140104	140105	140107	the useful lady	3105	" Ah do n't impugn my punctuality - it 's my character ! "
140185	140187	140179	140179	her	138	" beautiful "
140285	140340	140280	140280	Julia	138	" I understand , my poor friend , I know everything - she has told me only her side , but I 'm so competent that I know yours too - and I enter into the whole thing deeply . But it would be as much as my place is worth to accommodate you . "
140539	140545	140546	140546	Peter	144	" He tremendously wants it , "
140559	140567	140554	140554	she	491	" Well then , he may want ! "
140667	140669	140673	140673	he	144	" great "
140974	140984	140971	140971	She	138	" Dear no - though he 's very provoking . "
141153	141170	141146	141146	she	138	" I should have thought you 'd have come over to see your friend the actress . "
141171	141183	141184	141184	Peter	144	" Which of my friends ? I know so many actresses , "
141187	141209	141184	141184	Peter	144	" The woman you inflicted on us in this place a year ago - the one who 's in London now . "
141210	141236	141146	141146	she	138	" Oh Miriam Rooth ? I should have liked to come over , but I 've been tied fast . Have you seen her there ? "
141237	141245	141184	141184	Peter	144	" Yes , I 've seen her . "
141246	141252	141146	141146	she	138	" Do you like her ? "
141253	141258	141184	141184	Peter	144	" Not at all . "
141259	141266	141267	141267	Peter	144	" She has a lovely voice , "
141273	141289	141184	141184	Peter	144	" I do n't know anything about her voice - I have n't heard it . "
141290	141302	141184	141184	Peter	144	" But she does n't act in pantomime , does she ? "
141303	141325	141184	141184	Peter	144	" I do n't know anything about her acting . I saw her in private - at Nick Dormer 's studio . "
141326	141332	141333	141333	He	144	" At Nick 's - ? "
141338	141345	141184	141184	Peter	144	" What was she doing there ? "
141346	141362	141184	141184	Peter	144	" She was sprawling over the room and - rather insolently - staring at me . "
141369	141371	141184	141184	Peter	144	" draw "
141397	141412	141381	141381	she	166	" Why , does he know her so well ? I did n't know . "
141413	141429	141387	141387	his	144	" She 's sitting to him for her portrait - at least she was then . "
141430	141454	141381	141381	she	166	" Oh yes , I remember - I put him up to that . I 'm greatly interested . Is the portrait good ? "
141455	141476	141477	141477	Julia	138	" I have n't the least idea - I did n't look at it . I daresay it 's like , "
141481	141487	141490	141490	Peter	144	" But how in the world "
141496	141504	141490	141490	Peter	144	" does Nick find time to paint ? "
141505	141517	141381	141381	she	166	" I do n't know . That horrid man brought her . "
141518	141523	141525	141525	he	144	" Which horrid man ? "
141534	141588	141381	141381	she	166	" The one Nick thinks so clever - the vulgar little man who was at your place that day and tried to talk to me . I remember he abused theatrical people to me - as if I cared anything about them . But he has apparently something to do with your girl . "
141589	141602	141603	141603	Peter	144	" Oh I recollect him - I had a discussion with him , "
141607	141618	141619	141620	his sister	491	" How could you ? I must go and dress , "
141626	141657	141381	141381	she	166	" He was clever , remarkably . Miss Rooth and her mother were old friends of his , and he was the first person to speak of them to me . "
141658	141668	141670	141670	Julia	138	" What a distinction ! I thought him disgusting ! "
141684	141690	141692	141692	Peter	144	" Oh you 're severe , "
142348	142405	142408	142408	he	144	" I do n't know what you mean , but it seems to me quite the best precaution would be to care for a charming , steady girl like Biddy . Then you 'd be quite in shelter , you 'd know the worst that can happen to you , and it would n't be bad . "
142449	142467	142436	142436	Julia	138	" Do go and see her and be nice to her ; she 'll save you disappointments . "
142595	142598	142579	142579	her	491	" form . "
143301	143304	143305	143305	he	144	" retreat , "
143553	143556	143583	143583	His	144	" libraries , "
144059	144076	144056	144056	he	3209	" Oh I think - a - the a - sculpture , you know , sir . "
144085	144089	144056	144056	he	3209	" a - sculpture "
144321	144325	144317	144317	She	3001	" Oh Peter ! "
144329	144335	144317	144317	She	3001	" I 'm all alone . "
144336	144355	144317	144317	She	3001	" So much the better , dear Biddy . Is that any reason I should n't come in ? "
144356	144382	144383	144383	She	3001	" Dear no - do come in . You 've just missed Nick ; he has gone to the country - half an hour ago . "
144535	144677	144532	144532	she	3001	" I 'm just scraping here a little - you must n't mind me . What I do is awful , you know . Please , Peter , do n't look , I 've been coming here lately to make my little mess , because mamma does n't particularly like it at home . I 've had a lesson or two from a lady who exhibits , but you would n't suppose it to see what I do . Nick 's so kind ; he lets me come here ; he uses the studio so little ; I do what I want , or rather what I can . What a pity he 's gone - he 'd have been so glad . I 'm really alone - I hope you do n't mind . Peter , please do n't look . "
145806	145822	145823	145824	the girl	481	" I do n't think she has been very happy or very pleased of late , "
145827	145942	145823	145824	the girl	481	" I think she has had some disappointments , poor dear mamma ; and Grace has made her go out of town for three or four days in the hope of a little change . They 've gone down to see an old lady , Lady St. Dunstans , who never comes to London now and who , you know - she 's tremendously old - was papa 's godmother . It 's not very lively for Grace , but Grace is such a dear she 'll do anything for mamma . Mamma will go anywhere , no matter at what risk of discomfort , to see people she can talk with about papa . "
146102	146110	146111	146111	he	144	" That 's too unselfish of her , "
146121	146140	146111	146111	he	144	" Cousin Agnes ought to keep her near her always , if Grace is so obliging and devoted . "
146141	146163	146164	146164	Biddy	134	" Oh mamma would give up anything of that sort for our good ; she would n't sacrifice us that way ! "
146167	146205	146207	146207	Biddy	134	" Besides , I 'm the one to stay with mamma ; not that I can manage and look after her and do everything so well as Grace . But , you know , I want to , "
146229	146250	146251	146251	Peter	144	" But does n't your mother want the rest of you to get married - Percival and Nick and you ? "
146254	146285	146213	146213	her	134	" Oh she has given up Percy . I do n't suppose she thinks it would do . Dear Nick of course - that 's just what she does want . "
146291	146297	146286	146286	He	144	" And you , Biddy ? "
146298	146313	146286	146286	He	144	" Oh I daresay . But that does n't signify - I never shall . "
146367	146376	146379	146379	he	144	" What do you mean by getting on ? "
146395	146404	146405	146405	Biddy	134	" I mean crying one 's eyes out ! "
146430	146445	146410	146410	she	134	" Of course it 's about Nick that she 's really broken - hearted . "
146446	146454	146455	146455	he	144	" What 's the matter with Nick ? "
146463	146474	146475	146475	Biddy	134	" Oh Peter , what 's the matter with Julia ? "
146489	146515	146517	146518	the girl	481	" I daresay you know what we all hoped , what we all supposed from what they told us . And now they wo n't ! "
146520	146574	146575	146575	Peter	144	" Yes , Biddy , I know . I had the brightest prospect of becoming your brother - in - law : would n't that have been it - or something like that ? But it 's indeed visibly clouded . What 's the matter with them ? May I have another cigarette ? "
146606	146615	146616	146616	he	144	" Do n't they know how to love ? "
146624	146632	146633	146633	Biddy	134	" It seems a kind of fatality ! "
146807	146816	146818	146818	Peter	144	" And are you to dine at home ? "
146820	146826	146892	146893	the girl	481	" Certainly ; where else ? "
146827	146842	146818	146818	Peter	144	" And just you two alone ? Do you call that enjoying yourselves tremendously ? "
146843	146863	146892	146893	the girl	481	" It will do for me . No doubt I ought n't in modesty to speak for poor Florence . "
146864	146882	146818	146818	Peter	144	" It is n't fair to her ; you ought to invite some one to meet her . "
146883	146891	146892	146893	the girl	481	" Do you mean you , Peter ? "
146912	146923	146892	146893	the girl	481	" Try me . I 'll come like a shot . "
146924	146929	146931	146931	Biddy	134	" That 's kind , "
146968	146975	146957	146957	she	134	" Florence will like that immensely . "
146976	146992	146993	146993	Sherringham	144	" I 'm delighted to please Florence - your description of her 's so attractive ! "
147145	147152	147153	147153	she	134	" The theatre - Miss Tressilian ? "
147162	147212	147259	147260	the girl	481	" Would it incommode you very much to dine say at 7.15 and accept a place in my box ? The finger of Providence was in it when I took a box an hour ago . I particularly like your being free to go - if you are free . "
147221	147244	147213	147213	She	134	" Dear Peter , how good you are ! They 'll have it at any hour . Florence will be so glad . "
147245	147253	147213	147213	She	134	" And has Florence seen Miss Rooth ? "
147254	147258	147259	147260	the girl	481	" Miss Rooth ? "
147359	147370	147355	147355	her	134	" No , no , I 've not seen her . "
147390	147476	147386	147386	she	134	" We shall be too delighted . I saw her - perhaps you remember - in your rooms in Paris . I thought her so wonderful then ! Every one 's talking of her here . But we do n't go to the theatre much , you know : we do n't have boxes offered us except when you come . Poor Nick 's too much taken up in the evening . I 've wanted awfully to see her . They say she 's magnificent . "
147477	147483	147484	147484	Peter	318	" I do n't know , "
147494	147501	147484	147484	Peter	318	" I have n't seen her . "
147502	147509	147484	147484	Peter	318	" You have n't seen her ? "
147510	147527	147528	147528	he	318	" Never , Biddy . I mean on the stage . In private often - yes , "
147532	147535	147536	147536	Biddy	134	" Oh ! "
147631	147651	147621	147621	she	134	" Am I perhaps indiscreet in alluding to the circumstance that Nick has been painting Miss Rooth 's portrait ? "
147652	147669	147603	147603	she	134	" You 're not indiscreet in alluding to it to me , because I know it . "
147670	147681	147621	147621	she	134	" Then there 's no secret nor mystery about it ? "
147686	147695	147682	147682	Biddy	134	" I do n't think mamma knows it . "
147696	147713	147603	147603	she	134	" You mean you 've been keeping it from her because she would n't like it ? "
147714	147728	147682	147682	Biddy	134	" We 're afraid she may think papa would n't have liked it . "
147774	147786	147768	147768	He	318	" Ah yes , I remember that great man 's ideas , "
147792	147814	147768	147768	He	318	" May I ask if you know it , the fact we 're talking of , through Julia or through Nick ? "
147815	147824	147768	147768	He	318	" I know it from both of them . "
147825	147857	147768	147768	He	318	" Then if you 're in their confidence may I further ask if this undertaking of Nick 's is the reason why things seem to be at an end between them ? "
147858	147868	147869	147869	Biddy	134	" Oh I do n't think she likes it , "
147874	147880	147768	147768	He	318	" Is n't it good ? "
147881	147902	147768	147768	He	318	" Oh I do n't mean the picture - she has n't seen it . But his having done it . "
147903	147920	147768	147768	He	318	" Does she dislike it so much that that 's why she wo n't marry him ? "
147957	147988	147953	147953	she	134	" Oh Peter , it 's a great trouble - it 's a very great trouble ; and I ca n't tell you , for I do n't understand it . "
147989	147995	147996	147996	he	144	" If I ask you , "
147999	148046	147996	147996	he	144	" it 's not to pry into what does n't concern me ; but Julia 's my sister , and I ca n't after all help taking some interest in her life . She tells me herself so little . She does n't think me worthy . "
148047	148052	148053	148053	Biddy	134	" Ah poor Julia ! "
148104	148137	148138	148138	Peter	144	" Nick , I 'm sure , does n't treat you that way ; I 'm sure he confides in you ; he talks to you about his occupations , his ambitions , "
148141	148162	148138	148138	Peter	144	" And you understand him , you enter into them , you 're nice to him , you help him . "
148163	148176	148177	148177	Biddy	134	" Oh Nick 's life - it 's very dear to me , "
148180	148188	148177	148177	Biddy	134	" That must be jolly for him . "
148189	148196	148177	148177	Biddy	134	" It makes me very happy . "
148211	148244	148206	148206	he	144	" What the deuce is the matter with them then ? Why ca n't they hit it off together and be quiet and rational and do what every one wants them to ? "
148245	148254	148255	148256	the girl	481	" Oh Peter , it 's awfully complicated ! "
148261	148273	148255	148256	the girl	481	" Do you mean that Nick 's in love with her ? "
148274	148280	148255	148256	the girl	481	" In love with Julia ? "
148281	148290	148255	148256	the girl	481	" No , no , with Miriam Rooth . "
148336	148343	148344	148344	she	481	" He is n't , Peter , "
148348	148360	148361	148361	she	481	" Julia thinks it trifling - all that sort of thing , "
148363	148374	148361	148361	she	481	" She wants him to go in for different honours . "
148375	148390	148391	148391	Peter	144	" Julia 's the oddest woman . I mean I thought she loved him , "
148394	148403	148404	148404	He	144	" And when you love a person - ! "
148443	148465	148418	148418	Biddy	134	" I ca n't conceive her giving him up . He has great ability , besides being such a good fellow . "
148466	148482	148483	148483	Biddy	134	" It 's for his happiness , Peter - that 's the way she reasons , "
148487	148513	148483	148483	Biddy	134	" She does it for an idea ; she has told me a great deal about it , and I see the way she feels . "
148514	148543	148544	148544	he	3284	" You try to , Biddy , because you 're such a dear good - natured girl , but I do n't believe you do in the least , "
148551	148576	148544	148544	he	3284	" It 's too little the way you yourself would feel . Julia 's idea , as you call it , must be curious . "
148577	148585	148586	148586	Biddy	134	" Well , it is , Peter , "
148590	148602	148586	148586	Biddy	134	" She wo n't risk not coming out at the top . "
148603	148610	148586	148586	Biddy	134	" At the top of what ? "
148611	148616	148617	148617	Her	134	" Oh of everything . "
148629	148644	148586	148586	Biddy	134	" Surely one 's at the top of everything when one 's in love . "
148645	148651	148653	148654	the girl	481	" I do n't know , "
148656	148662	148663	148663	Peter	144	" Do you doubt it ? "
148666	148679	148586	148586	Biddy	134	" I 've never been in love and I never shall be . "
148680	148693	148694	148694	he	3284	" You 're as perverse , in your way , as Julia , "
148699	148729	148694	148694	he	3284	" But I confess I do n't understand Nick 's attitude any better . He seems to me , if I may say so , neither fish nor flesh . "
148730	148748	148749	148749	Biddy	134	" Oh his attitude 's very noble , Peter ; his state of mind 's wonderfully interesting , "
148752	148762	148763	148763	she	481	" Surely you must be in favour of art , "
148776	148789	148769	148769	him	3284	" Dear Biddy , your little digs are as soft as zephyrs . "
148797	148815	148794	148794	she	481	" My little digs ? What do you mean ? Are n't you in favour of art ? "
148816	148842	148843	148843	he	3284	" The question 's delightfully simple . I do n't know what you 're talking about . Everything has its place . A parliamentary life , "
148858	148858	148843	148843	he	3284	"
148859	148867	148794	148794	she	481	" That 's just what Nick says . "
148868	148878	148843	148843	he	3284	" You talk of it together a great deal ? "
148879	148889	148794	148794	she	481	" Yes , Nick 's very good to me . "
148890	148901	148843	148843	he	3284	" Clever Nick ! And what do you advise him ? "
148902	148908	148794	148794	she	481	" Oh to do something . "
148909	148914	148915	148915	Peter	144	" That 's valuable , "
148918	148937	148915	148915	Peter	144	" Not to give up his sweetheart for the sake of a paint - pot , I hope ? "
148938	148955	148956	148956	Biddy	319	" Never , never , Peter ! It 's not a question of his giving up , "
148959	149036	148956	148956	Biddy	319	" for Julia has herself shaken free . I think she never really felt safe - she loved him , but was afraid of him . Now she 's only afraid - she has lost the confidence she tried to have . Nick has tried to hold her , but she has wrested herself away . Do you know what she said to me ? She said , ' My confidence has gone for ever . ' "
149037	149048	149049	149049	Julia	138	" I did n't know she was such a prig ! "
149054	149099	149049	149049	Julia	138	" They 're queer people , verily , with water in their veins instead of blood . You and I would n't be like that , should we ? - though you have taken up such a discouraging position about caring for a fellow . "

149127	149137	149121	149121	Peter	144	" To that of making you laugh at me . "
149145	149158	149140	149140	he	144	" Would you give a good man up for ' art ' ? "
149159	149167	149108	149108	Biddy	319	" A good man ? What man ? "
149168	149181	149140	149140	he	144	" Well , say me - if I wanted to marry you . "
149189	149211	149212	149212	she	319	" Of course I would - in a moment . At any rate I 'd give up the House of Commons , "
149215	149234	149212	149212	she	319	" That 's what Nick 's going to do now - only you must n't tell any one . "
149238	149248	149235	149235	Peter	144	" He 's going to chuck up his seat ? "
149249	149283	149284	149284	she	319	" I think his mind is made up to it . He has talked me over - we 've had some deep discussions . Yes , I 'm on the side of art ! "
149288	149302	149303	149303	Peter	144	" Do you mean in order to paint - to paint that girl ? "
149307	149373	149374	149374	Biddy	319	" To paint every one - that 's what he wants . By keeping his seat he has n't kept Julia , and she was the thing he cared for most in public life . When he has got out of the whole thing his attitude , as he says , will be at least clear . He 's tremendously interesting about it , Peter , "
149377	149403	149374	149374	Biddy	319	" has talked to me wonderfully - has won me over . Mamma 's heart - broken ; telling her will be the hardest part . "
149404	149411	149412	149412	he	144	" If she does n't know , "
149415	149424	149412	149412	he	144	" why then is she heart - broken ? "
149425	149477	149374	149374	Biddy	319	" Oh at the hitch about their marriage - she knows that . Their marriage has been so what she wanted . She thought it perfection . She blames Nick fearfully . She thinks he held the whole thing in his hand and that he has thrown away a magnificent opportunity . "
149478	149487	149412	149412	he	144	" And what does Nick say to her ? "
149488	149498	149374	149374	Biddy	319	" He says , ' Dear old mummy ! ' "
149499	149504	149505	149505	Peter	144	" That 's good , "
149508	149524	149525	149525	Biddy	319	" I do n't know what will become of her when this other blow arrives , "
149529	149566	149525	149525	Biddy	319	" Poor Nick wants to please her - he does , he does . But , as he says , you ca n't please every one and you must before you die please yourself a little . "

150216	150222	150164	150164	her	319	" One of those perhaps . "
150223	150231	150162	150162	She	319	" Have n't you tried to see ? "
150232	150238	150164	150164	her	319	" I have n't touched them "
150246	150257	150162	150162	She	319	" Has n't Nick had it out to show you ? "
150258	150279	150162	150162	She	319	" He says it 's in too bad a state - it is n't finished - it wo n't do . "
150280	150295	150162	150162	She	319	" And have n't you had the curiosity to turn it round for yourself ? "
150323	150335	150312	150312	her	319	" I 've had an idea he would n't like it . "
150379	150389	150390	150390	he	224	" Dear Biddy , have you such intense delicacy ? "
150537	150559	150532	150532	she	319	" I have n't wanted so much to see it ! I do n't care for her so much as that ! "
150560	150566	150567	150567	He	144	" So much as what ? "
150573	150593	150595	150595	Biddy	319	" I do n't care for his actress - for that vulgar creature . I do n't like her ! "
150602	150611	150599	150599	Peter	144	" I thought you had n't seen her . "
150612	150633	150634	150634	He	144	" I saw her in Paris - twice . She was wonderfully clever , but she did n't charm me . "

150753	150770	150771	150771	she	319	" For the sake of your company , Peter ! Here it is , I think , "

He was not unconscious that he was taking all sorts of impossibilities and miracles for granted ; but he was under the conviction , for the time , that the woman he had been watching three hours , the incarnation of the serious drama , would be a new and vivifying force . The world was just then so bright to him that even Basil Dashwood struck him at first as a conceivable agent of his dream .

The merit of her behaviour on that occasion , as Nick knew , was that she had not been specious at her lover 's expense : she had breathed no doubt of his public purpose and had had the strange grace to say that in truth she was older than he , so that it was only fair to give his affections time to mature . But when Nick saw their hopeful host after the rupture at which we have been present he found him in no state to deal with worries : he was seriously ailing , it was the beginning of worse things and not a time to put his attention to the stretch . After this excursion Nick had gone back to town saddened by his patient 's now unmistakably settled decline , but rather relieved that he had had himself to make no confession . It had even occurred to him that the need for making one at all might never come up . Certainly it would n't if the ebb of Mr. Carteret 's strength should continue unchecked . He might pass away in the persuasion that everything would happen as he wished it , though indeed without enriching Nick on his wedding - day to the tune he had promised . Very likely he had made legal arrangements in virtue of which his bounty would take effect in case of the right event and in that case alone . At present Nick had a bigger , an uglier truth to tell - the last three days had made the difference ; but , oddly enough , though his responsibility had increased his reluctance to speak had vanished : he was positively eager to clear up a situation over which it was not consistent with his honour to leave a shade .

165247	165301	165302	165302	I	0	" ; on which Nick sank into the seat he had occupied the day before , replying that he had been delighted to come , whatever the reason . Mr. Carteret said nothing more about the division or the second reading ; he only murmured that they were keeping the newspapers for him . "

165347	165447	165448	165448	I	0	" This was the only thing not quite straight that Nick found in him - his making light of his young friend 's flying to and fro . The young friend sat looking at him with a sense that was half compunction and half the idea of the rare beauty of his face , to which , strangely , the waste of illness now seemed to have restored something of its youth . Mr. Carteret was evidently conscious that this morning he should n't be able to go on long , so that he must be practical and concise . "
165459	165462	165448	165448	I	0	" he continued .
165463	165489	165492	165492	Nick	224	" I need n't tell you what a pleasure it is to me to see you - there can be no better reason than that , "
165496	165511	165492	165492	Nick	224	" Has n't the year come round - the year of that foolish arrangement ? "
165550	165571	165572	165572	he	224	" Do you mean the period for which Mrs. Dallow insisted on keeping me dangling ? Oh that 's over ! "

165605	165624	165625	165625	Nick	224	" We 're uncomfortable , unreasonable people , not deserving of your interest . We 're not married , "
165628	165638	165639	165640	his host	775	" Then I have n't been ill so long ? "
165646	165656	165657	165657	he	224	" Not very long - but things are different , "
165678	165692	165661	165663	The old man	2238	" You mean the arrangements are made - the day 's at hand ? "
165693	165699	165700	165700	Nick	224	" There are no arrangements , "
165703	165711	165700	165700	Nick	224	" But why should it trouble you ? "
165712	165722	165761	165761	he	224	" What then will you do - without arrangements ? "
165730	165755	165758	165758	Nick	224	" We shall do nothing - there 's nothing to be done . We 're not to be married - it 's all off , "
165764	165771	165761	165761	he	224	" Mrs. Dallow has gone abroad . "
165786	165794	165772	165774	The old man	2238	" Ah I do n't like that . "
165795	165803	165761	165761	he	224	" No more do I , sir . "
165804	165818	165772	165774	The old man	2238	" What 's the matter ? It was so good - so good . "
165819	165828	165829	165829	Nick	224	" It was n't good enough for Julia , "
165832	165866	165867	165868	Mr. Carteret	152	" For Julia ? Is Julia so great as that ? She told me she had the greatest regard for you . You 're good enough for the best , my dear boy , "
165871	165902	165867	165868	Mr. Carteret	152	" You do n't know me : I am disappointing . She had , I believe , a great regard for me , but I 've forfeited her good opinion . "
165948	165956	165957	165957	he	2238	" Have you been unfaithful to her ? "
165962	165989	166018	166018	he	224	" She thinks so - it comes to the same thing . As I told you a year ago , she does n't believe in me . "
165990	166005	166007	166008	Mr. Carteret	152	" You ought to have made her - you ought to have made her , "
166021	166054	166018	166018	he	224	" Do you remember what I told you I 'd give you if you did ? Do you remember what I told you I 'd give you on your wedding - day ? "
166055	166084	166018	166018	he	224	" You expressed the most generous intentions ; and I remember them as much as a man may do who has no wish to remind you of them . "
166085	166097	166018	166018	he	224	" The money 's there - I 've put it aside . "
166098	166123	166125	166125	Nick	224	" I have n't earned it - I have n't earned a penny of it . Give it to those who deserve it more , "
166127	166138	166139	166140	Mr. Carteret	152	" I do n't understand , I do n't understand , "
166158	166173	166155	166155	he	152	" I 'm not good for much discussion ; I 'm very much disappointed . "
166174	166193	166194	166194	Nick	224	" I think I may say it 's not my fault - I 've done what I can , "
166197	166210	166155	166155	he	152	" But when people are in love they do more than that . "
166211	166218	166220	166222	our young man	528	" Oh it 's all over ! "
166257	166279	166243	166243	he	528	" We 've tormented each other and we 've tormented you - and that 's all that has come of it . "
166291	166312	166280	166281	His companion	647	" Do n't you care for what I 'd have done for you - should n't you have liked it ? "
166313	166330	166331	166331	Nick	224	" Of course one likes kindness - one likes money . But it 's all over , "
166338	166380	166335	166335	he	224	" I fatigue you , I knock you up , with telling you these troubles . I only do so because it seems to me right you should know . But do n't be worried - everything 's for the best . "
166592	166599	166588	166588	he	224	" Have you done anything bad ? "
166600	166606	166607	166607	Nick	224	" Nothing worse than usual , "
166610	166620	166607	166607	Nick	224	" Ah everything should have been better than usual . "
166621	166635	166588	166588	he	224	" Well , it has n't been that - that I must say . "
166636	166645	166646	166647	Mr. Carteret	152	" Do you sometimes think of your father ? "
166656	166671	166650	166650	Nick	224	" You make me think of him - you 've always that pleasant effect . "
166672	166685	166588	166588	he	224	" His name would have lived - it must n't be lost . "
166686	166698	166699	166699	Nick	224	" Yes , but the competition to - day is terrible , "
166722	166730	166718	166718	he	224	" I never supposed you a trifler . "
166731	166739	166588	166588	he	224	" I 'm determined not to be . "
166740	166753	166754	166755	Mr. Carteret	152	" I thought her charming . Do n't you love Mrs. Dallow ? "
166759	166788	166718	166718	he	224	" Do n't put it to me so to - day , for I feel sore and injured . I do n't think she has treated me well . "
166789	166804	166805	166807	the old man	2238	" You should have held her - you should n't have let her go , "
166844	166855	166838	166838	Nick	224	" I have n't been clever enough , no doubt . "
166856	166868	166869	166870	Mr. Carteret	152	" Do n't say that , do n't say that - ! "
166876	166929	166930	166930	he	2238	" Do n't think I can allow you any easing - off of that sort . I know how well you 've done . You 're taking your place . Several gentlemen have told me . Has n't she felt a scruple , knowing my settlement on you to depend - - ? "
166933	166947	166869	166870	Mr. Carteret	152	" Oh she has n't known - has n't known anything about it . "
166948	166963	166965	166967	the poor gentleman	3807	" I do n't understand ; though I think you explained somewhat a year ago "
166972	167073	166965	166967	the poor gentleman	3807	" I think she wanted to speak to me - of any intentions I might have in regard to you - the day she was here . Very nicely , very properly she 'd have done it , I 'm sure . I think her idea was that I ought to make any settlement quite independent of your marrying her or not marrying her . But I tried to convey to her - I do n't know whether she understood me - that I liked her too much for that , I wanted too much to make sure of her . "
167074	167084	167086	167086	Nick	224	" To make sure of me , you mean , "
167088	167099	167086	167086	Nick	224	" And now after all you see you have n't . "
167100	167108	167110	167112	the old man	2238	" Well , perhaps it was that , "
167115	167129	167130	167130	Nick	224	" All this is very bad for you - we 'll talk again , "
167133	167182	167183	167184	Mr. Carteret	152	" No , no - let us finish it now . I like to know what I 'm doing . I shall rest better when I do know . There are great things to be done ; the future will be full - the future will be fine , "
167187	167225	167226	167226	Nick	224	" Let me be distinct about this for Julia : that if we had n't been sundered her generosity to me would have been complete - she 'd have put her great fortune absolutely at my disposal , "
167232	167259	167226	167226	Nick	224	" Her consciousness of all that naturally carries her over any particular distress in regard to what wo n't come to me now from another source . "
167260	167267	167268	167270	the old man	2238	" Ah do n't lose it ! "
167274	167283	167284	167284	Nick	224	" It 's in your hands , sir , "
167287	167310	167226	167226	Nick	224	" I mean Mrs. Dallow 's fortune . It will be of the highest utility . That was what your father missed . "
167311	167321	167323	167323	Nick	224	" I shall miss more than my father did , "
167325	167342	167323	167323	Nick	224	" Shell come back to you - I ca n't look at you and doubt that . "
167350	167381	167343	167343	Nick	224	" Never , never , never ! You look at me , my grand old friend , but you do n't see me . I 'm not what you think . "
167382	167396	167397	167398	Mr. Carteret	152	" What is it - what is it ? Have you been bad ? "
167401	167416	167343	167343	Nick	224	" No , no ; I 'm not bad . But I 'm different . "
167417	167422	167343	167343	Nick	224	" Different - - ? "
167423	167438	167343	167343	Nick	224	" Different from my father . Different from Mrs. Dallow . Different from you . "
167439	167447	167448	167450	the old man	2238	" Ah why do you perplex me ? "
167453	167459	167448	167450	the old man	2238	" You 've done something . "
167460	167475	167477	167477	Nick	224	" I do n't want to perplex you , but I have done something , "
167499	167510	167512	167513	Mr. Carteret	152	" What has he done - what has he done ? "
167558	167589	167590	167590	Nick	224	" He has only excited you , I 'm afraid , a little more than is good for you . Is n't your dear old head a little too high ? "
167834	167848	167829	167829	she	333	" What in the world were you trying to get out of him ? "
168077	168087	168070	168074	The nurse at the door	3833	" Only a moment , I hope , sir ? "
168162	168182	168141	168149	the old man , with fixed , enlarged eyes	3836	" What have you done - what have you done ? Have you associated yourself with some other woman ? "
168183	168199	168141	168149	the old man , with fixed , enlarged eyes	3836	" No , no ; I do n't think she can accuse me of that . "
168200	168218	168141	168149	the old man , with fixed , enlarged eyes	3836	" Well then she 'll come back to you if you take the right way with her . "
168254	168283	168284	168285	the visitor	2163	" I 've taken the wrong way . I 've done something that must spoil my prospects in that direction for ever . I 've written a letter , "
168297	168304	168284	168285	the visitor	2163	" You 've written a letter ? "
168305	168320	168284	168285	the visitor	2163	" To my constituents , informing them of my determination to resign my seat . "
168321	168327	168284	168285	the visitor	2163	" To resign your seat ? "
168328	168374	168284	168285	the visitor	2163	" I 've made up my mind , after no end of reflexion , dear Mr. Carteret , to work on quite other lines . I 've a plan of becoming a painter . So I 've given up the idea of a political life . "
168375	168379	168284	168285	the visitor	2163	" A painter ? "
168387	168427	168380	168381	Mr. Carteret	152	" I 'm going in for the portrait in oils . It sounds absurd , I know , and I 'm thus specific only to show you I do n't in the least expect you to count on me . "
168449	168495	168496	168496	Nick	224	" Do n't let it trouble you now ; it 's a long story and rather a poor one ; when you get better I 'll tell you all about it . Well talk it over amicably and I 'll bring you to my view , "
168532	168537	168524	168524	he	224	" This is dreadful news "
168546	168588	168543	168543	his	152	" Certainly it must seem so to you , for I 've always kept from you - I was ashamed , and my present confusion is a just chastisement - the great interest I have always taken in the - - ! "
168614	168622	168623	168623	He	224	" In the pencil and the brush . "
168671	168687	168688	168689	Mr. Carteret	152	" The pencil - the brush ? They 're not the weapons of a gentleman , "
168692	168738	168688	168689	Mr. Carteret	152	" I was sure that would be your feeling . I repeat that I mention them only because you once said you intended to do something for me , as the phrase is , and I thought you ought n't to do it in ignorance . "
168739	168753	168688	168689	Mr. Carteret	152	" My ignorance was better . Such knowledge is n't good for me . "
168754	168763	168764	168764	Nick	224	" Forgive me , my dear old friend , "
168770	168781	168764	168764	Nick	224	" When you 're better you 'll see it differently . "
168782	168790	168764	168764	Nick	224	" I shall never be better now . "
168791	168795	168796	168796	Nick	224	" Ah no , "
168799	168824	168796	168796	Nick	224	" it will really do you good after a little . Think it over quietly and you 'll be glad I 've stopped humbugging . "
168825	168837	168838	168840	the old man	2238	" I loved you - I loved you as my son , "
168857	168877	168843	168843	He	2238	" Get better , get better , and I 'll be your son for the rest of your life . "
168878	168885	168886	168887	Mr. Carteret	152	" Poor Dormer - poor Dormer ! "
168892	168908	168910	168910	Nick	224	" I admit that if he had lived I probably should n't have done it , "
168912	168928	168910	168910	Nick	224	" I daresay I should have deferred to his prejudices even though thinking them narrow . "
168929	168937	168978	168978	he	224	" Do you turn against your father ? "
168982	168997	168978	168978	he	224	" Do you give up your name , do you give up your country ? "
168998	169010	169011	169011	Nick	224	" If I do something good my country may like it . "
169021	169033	169011	169011	Nick	224	" Do you regard them as equal , the two glories ? "
169034	169048	169050	169050	Nick	224	" Here comes your nurse to blow me up and turn me out , "
169069	169082	169059	169060	Mr. Carteret	152	" Be so good as to wait till I send for you , "
169158	169173	169141	169142	that personage	2874	" Do you pretend there 's a nobler life than a high political career ? "
169174	169230	169260	169262	The old man	2238	" I think the noble life 's doing one 's work well . One can do it very ill and be very base and mean in what you call a high political career . I have n't been in the House so many months without finding that out . It contains some very small souls . "
169231	169243	169245	169246	Mr. Carteret	152	" You should stand against them - you should expose them ! "
169248	169259	169260	169262	The old man	2238	" Stand against them , against one 's own party ! "
169273	169288	169260	169262	The old man	2238	" God forgive you , are you a Tory , are you a Tory ? "
169289	169296	169298	169298	Nick	224	" How little you understand me ! "
169305	169324	169260	169262	The old man	2238	" Little enough - little enough , my boy . Have you sent your electors your dreadful letter ? "
169325	169342	169260	169262	The old man	2238	" Not yet ; but it 's all ready and I sha n't change my mind . "
169343	169363	169365	169366	the invalid	3758	" You will - you will . You 'll think better of it . You 'll see your duty , "
169370	169420	169260	169262	The old man	2238	" That seems very improbable , for my determination , crudely and abruptly as , to my great regret , it comes to you here , is the fruit of a long and painful struggle . The difficulty is that I see my duty just in this other effort . "
169421	169456	169457	169458	Mr. Carteret	152	" An effort ? Do you call it an effort to fall away , to sink far down , to give up every effort ? What does your mother say , heaven help her ? "
169469	169477	169457	169458	Mr. Carteret	152	" I have n't told her yet . "
169478	169487	169488	169488	Nick	224	" You 're ashamed , you 're ashamed ! "
169505	169522	169488	169488	Nick	224	" Tell her it would have been sixty thousand . I had the money all ready . "
169523	169531	169533	169533	Nick	224	" I sha n't tell her that , "
169538	169546	169547	169548	Mr. Carteret	152	" Poor woman - poor dear woman ! "
169552	169562	169547	169548	Mr. Carteret	152	" Yes indeed - she wo n't like it . "
169563	169578	169488	169488	Nick	224	" Think it all over again ; do n't throw away a splendid future ! "
169611	169621	169605	169605	he	224	" I 'm tired - I 'm very tired , "
169675	169682	169656	169656	He	224	" Come back , come back , "
169689	169701	169683	169684	Mr. Carteret	152	" come back and tell me it 's a horrible dream . "
169817	169828	169788	169788	he	224	" Then of course my settlement does n't take effect ! "
169829	169836	169837	169837	Nick	224	" Oh that 's all right , "
170717	170741	170712	170712	he	224	" Dear mother , we do n't hit it off , after all ; it 's an awful bore , but we do n't "

174827	174855	174868	174868	Nash	147	" Oh , I 'm never another man - I 'm always more the wrong one than the man himself . It 's you she 's after . "

175072	175112	175069	175069	Gabriel	147	" Miriam knows you 're engaged to a wonderful , rich lady ; she told me as much , told me she had seen her here . That was enough to set her off - she likes forbidden fruit . "
175113	175126	175127	175127	Nick	224	" I 'm not engaged to any lady whatever . I was , "
175131	175139	175127	175127	Nick	224	" but we 've altered our minds . "
175140	175147	175148	175149	his friend	610	" Ah , what a pity ! "
175152	175155	175158	175158	he	224	" Mephistopheles ! "
175167	175199	175200	175200	Nash	147	" Pray then whom do you call Margaret ? May I ask if your failure of interest in the political situation is the cause of this change in your personal one ? "
175215	175261	175212	175212	he	224	" I 'm not in the least devilish - I only mean it 's a pity you 've altered your minds , since Miriam may in consequence alter hers . She goes from one thing to another . However , I wo n't tell her . "
175262	175267	175268	175268	Nick	224	" I will then ! "
175275	175282	175283	175284	his companion	647	" Would that really be prudent ? "
175293	175298	175299	175299	he	224	" At any rate , "
175302	175328	175299	175299	he	224	" nothing would induce me to interfere with Peter Sherringham . That sounds fatuous , but to you I do n't mind appearing an ass . "
175329	175342	175343	175343	Nash	147	" The thing would be to get Sherringham , out of spite , "
175347	175355	175343	175343	Nash	147	" to entangle himself with another woman . "
175356	175363	175299	175299	he	224	" What good would that do ? "
175364	175376	175343	175343	Nash	147	" Ah , Miriam would then begin to think of him . "
175377	175391	175299	175299	he	224	" Spite surely is n't a conceivable motive - for a healthy man . "
175401	175418	175398	175398	Gabriel	147	" Sherringham 's just precisely not a healthy man . He 's too much in love . "
175419	175429	175343	175343	Nash	147	" Then he wo n't care for another woman . "
175430	175448	175398	175398	Gabriel	147	" He would try to , and that would produce its effect - its effect on Miriam . "
175449	175468	175469	175469	Nick	224	" You talk like an American novel . Let him try , and God keep us all straight . "
175497	175499	175469	175469	Nick	224	" try "
175568	175586	175563	175563	Nash	147	" Oh , if you 'll simply do your part I 'll take care of the rest . "
175587	175609	175610	175610	Nick	224	" If you mean by doing my part minding my business and working like a beaver I shall easily satisfy you , "
175613	175630	175631	175632	his companion	647	" Ah , you reprobate , you 'll become another Sir Joshua , a mere P.R.A. ! "
176217	176323	176199	176199	she	170	" the audiences , the critics , the money were all to be found , but she cast a spell that prevented this from seeming a serious hitch . One might n't see from one day to the other what she would do or how she would do it , but this would n't stay her steps - she would none the less go on . She would have to construct her own road , as it were , but at the worst there would only be delays in making it . These delays would depend on the hardness of the stones she had to break .
176334	176336	176325	176325	Peter	144	" have "
176688	176704	176705	176705	Peter	144	" Oh , she 'll have some good years - they 'll be worth having , "
176711	176751	176705	176705	Peter	144	" Besides , you see her too much as a humbug and too little as a real producer . She has ideas - great ones ; she loves the thing for itself . That may keep a woman serious . "
176752	176832	176833	176833	Nash	147	" Her greatest idea must always be to show herself , and fortunately she has a great quantity of that treasure to show . I think of her absolutely as a real producer , but as a producer whose production is her own person . No ' person , ' even as fine a one as hers , will stand that for more than an hour , so that humbuggery has very soon to lend a hand . However , "
176836	176911	176833	176833	Nash	147	" if she 's a fine humbug it will do as well , it will perfectly suit the time . We can all be saved by vulgarity ; that 's the solvent of all difficulties and the blessing of this delightful age . One does n't die of it - save in soul and sense : one dies only of minding it . Therefore let no man despair - a new hope has dawned . "
176912	176934	176935	176935	Peter	144	" She 'll do her work like any other worker , with the advantage over many that her talent 's rare , "
176939	176971	176935	176935	Peter	144	" Compared with the life of many women that 's security and sanity of the highest order . Then she ca n't help her beauty . You ca n't vulgarise that . "
176972	176979	176980	176980	Gabriel	147	" Oh , ca n't you ? "
176983	177009	176935	176935	Peter	144	" It will abide with her till the day of her death . It is n't a mere superficial freshness . She 's very noble . "
177010	177020	177022	177022	Nash	147	" Yes , that 's the pity of it , "
177024	177159	177022	177022	Nash	147	" She 's a big more or less directed force , and I quite admit that she 'll do for a while a lot of good . She 'll have brightened up the world for a great many people - have brought the ideal nearer to them and held it fast for an hour with its feet on earth and its great wings trembling . That 's always something , for blest is he who has dropped even the smallest coin into the little iron box that contains the precious savings of mankind . Miriam will doubtless have dropped a big gold - piece . It will be found in the general scramble on the day the race goes bankrupt . And then for herself she 'll have had a great go at life . "
177160	177179	177180	177180	Peter	144	" Oh yes , she 'll have got out of her hole - she wo n't have vegetated , "
177183	177278	177180	177180	Peter	144	" That makes her touching to me - it adds to the many good reasons for which one may want to help her . She 's tackling a big job , and tackling it by herself ; throwing herself upon the world in good faith and dealing with it as she can ; meeting alone , in her youth , her beauty , her generosity , all the embarrassments of notoriety and all the difficulties of a profession of which , if one half 's what 's called brilliant the other 's frankly odious . "
177279	177302	177303	177303	Nash	147	" She has great courage , but you speak of her as solitary with such a lot of us all round her ? "
177307	177327	177022	177022	Nash	147	" She 's a great thing for you and me , but we 're a small thing for her . "
177328	177349	177350	177350	Gabriel	147	" Well , a good many small things , if they but stick together , may make up a mass , "
177353	177386	177350	177350	Gabriel	147	" There must always be the man , you see . He 's the indispensable element in such a life , and he 'll be the last thing she 'll ever lack . "
177387	177395	177396	177396	Peter	144	" What man are you talking about ? "
177402	177419	177350	177350	Gabriel	147	" The man of the hour , whoever he is . She 'll inspire innumerable devotions . "
177420	177441	177350	177350	Gabriel	147	" Of course she will , and they 'll be precisely a part of the insufferable side of her life . "
177442	177447	177448	177448	Nash	147	" Insufferable to whom ? "
177451	177621	177448	177448	Nash	147	" Do n't forget that the insufferable side of her life will be just the side she 'll thrive on . You ca n't eat your cake and have it , and you ca n't make omelettes without breaking eggs . You ca n't at once sit by the fire and parade about the world , and you ca n't take all chances without having some adventures . You ca n't be a great actress without the luxury of nerves . Without a plentiful supply - or without the right ones - you 'll only be second fiddle . If you 've all the tense strings you may take life for your fiddlestick . Your nerves and your adventures , your eggs and your cake , are part of the cost of the most expensive of professions . You play with human passions , with exaltations and ecstasies and terrors , and if you trade on the fury of the elements you must know how to ride the storm . "
177629	177656	177624	177624	Peter	144	" Those are the fine old commonplaces about the artistic temperament , but I usually find the artist a very meek , decent , little person . "
177657	177704	177705	177705	Nash	147	" You never find the artist - you only find his work , and that 's all you need find . When the artist 's a woman , and the woman 's an actress , meekness and decency will doubtless be there in the right proportions , "
177709	177729	177705	177705	Nash	147	" Miriam will represent them for you , if you give her her cue , with the utmost charm . "
177730	177743	177745	177745	Peter	144	" Of course she 'll inspire devotions - that 's all right , "
177751	177783	177784	177784	Nash	147	" And of course they 'll inspire responses , and with that consequence - do n't you see ? - they 'll mitigate her solitude , they 'll even enliven it , "
177788	177803	177804	177804	Peter	144	" She 'll probably box a good many ears : that 'll be lively ! "
177810	177835	177836	177836	Gabriel	147	" Oh magnificent ! - it will be a merry life . Yet with its tragic passages , its distracted or its pathetic hours , "
177839	177848	177836	177836	Gabriel	147	" In short , a little of everything . "
177861	177881	177858	177858	Peter	144	" The best thing for a woman in her situation is to marry some decent care - taking man . "
177882	177892	177893	177893	Nash	147	" Oh I daresay she 'll do that too ! "
177924	177935	177921	177921	he	147	" There 's somebody she 'd marry to - morrow . "
177939	177947	177936	177936	Peter	144	" Do you mean her friend Dashwood ? "
177948	177958	177921	177921	he	147	" No , no , I mean Nick Dormer . "
177959	177965	177966	177966	Peter	144	" She 'd marry him ? "
177969	177987	177921	177921	he	147	" I mean her head 's full of him . But she 'll hardly get the chance . "
177992	178002	177990	177990	himself	144	" Does she like him as much as that ? "
178003	178021	177921	177921	he	147	" I do n't quite know how much you mean , but enough for all practical ends . "
178022	178033	177990	177990	himself	144	" Marrying a fashionable actress is hardly a practical end . "
178034	178049	178050	178050	Nash	147	" Certainly not , but I 'm not speaking from his point of view . "
178055	178074	178050	178050	Nash	147	" Moreover , I thought you just now said it would be such a good thing for her . "
178075	178081	177990	177990	himself	144	" To marry Nick Dormer ? "
178082	178099	178050	178050	Nash	147	" You said a good decent man , and he 's one of the very decentest . "
178100	178147	177990	177990	himself	144	" I was n't thinking of the individual , but of the protection . It would fence her about , settle certain questions , or appear to ; it would make things safe and comfortable for her and keep a lot of cads and blackguards away . "
178148	178161	178163	178163	Nash	147	" She ought to marry the prompter or the box - keeper , "
178165	178184	178163	178163	Nash	147	" Then it would be all right . I think indeed they generally do , do n't they ? "
178243	178260	178239	178239	his	610	" Has she told you she 's - a - she 's in love with Nick ? "
178261	178275	178239	178239	his	610	" No , no - that 's not the way I know it . "
178276	178283	178239	178239	his	610	" Has Nick told you then ? "
178284	178294	178239	178239	his	610	" On the contrary , I 've told him . "
178295	178309	178310	178310	Peter	144	" You 've rendered him a questionable service if you 've no proof , "
178313	178334	178239	178239	his	610	" My proof 's only that I 've seen her with him . She 's charming , poor dear thing . "
178335	178351	178239	178239	his	610	" But surely she is n't in love with every man she 's charming to . "
178352	178361	178362	178362	Nash	147	" I mean she 's charming to me , "
178365	178403	178362	178362	Nash	147	" I see her that way . I see her interested - and what it does to her , with her , for her . But judge for yourself - the first time you get a chance . "
178404	178419	178239	178239	his	610	" When shall I get a chance ? Nick does n't come near her . "
178420	178436	178362	178362	Nash	147	" Oh he 'll come , he 'll come ; his picture is n't finished . "
178437	178450	178239	178239	his	610	" You mean he 'll be the box - keeper , then ? "
178451	178462	178464	178465	Gabriel Nash	147	" My dear fellow , I shall never allow it , "
178467	178690	178464	178465	Gabriel Nash	147	" It would be idiotic and quite unnecessary . He 's beautifully arranged - in quite a different line . Fancy his taking that sort of job on his hands ! Besides , she 'd never expect it ; she 's not such a goose . They 're very good friends - it will go on that way . She 's an excellent person for him to know ; she 'll give him lots of ideas of the plastic kind . He would have been up there before this , but it has taken him time to play his delightful trick on his constituents . That of course is pure amusement ; but when once his effect has been well produced he 'll get back to business , and his business will be a very different matter from Miriam 's . Imagine him writing her advertisements , living on her money , adding up her profits , having rows and recriminations with her agent , carrying her shawl , spending his days in her rouge - pot . The right man for that , if she must have one , will turn up . ' Pour le mariage , non . ' She is n't wholly an idiot ; she really , for a woman , quite sees things as they are . "
178803	178814	178928	178928	Peter	144	" Leave it , you mean , for some man ? "
178815	178824	178928	178928	Peter	144	" For the man we 're talking about . "
178825	178830	178831	178831	Peter	144	" For Nick Dormer ? "
178847	178882	178884	178884	Nash	147	" If he should make it a condition . But why should he ? why should he make any conditions ? He 's not an ass either . You see it would be a bore "
178893	178913	178884	178884	Nash	147	" because if she were to do anything of that sort she 'd make him pay for the sacrifice . "
178914	178927	178928	178928	Peter	144	" Oh yes , she 'd make him pay for the sacrifice , "
178932	178947	178948	178948	Gabriel	147	" And then when he had paid she 'd go back to her footlights , "
178963	178976	178977	178977	Peter	144	" I see - she 'd go back - good - night , "
178980	178985	178986	178986	he	144	" Please go on ! "
179009	179019	179004	179004	he	144	" Of course she would - and quite right ! "
179021	179031	179032	179032	Nash	147	" Judge for yourself when you get a chance , "
179283	179288	179289	179289	Peter	144	" Hang his convenience ! "
179297	179299	179303	179306	one of the family	4104	" Arty "

180883	180885	180887	180887	he	224	" game "
181233	181255	181256	181256	Nick	224	" They all say that - all the charming women , but I should n't have looked for it from you , "
181259	181276	181256	181256	Nick	224	" I 've given you such an example of what I can do in another line . "
181277	181396	181218	181218	she	2497	" Do you mean my portrait ? Oh I 've got it , with your name and ' M.P. ' in the corner , and that 's precisely why I 'm content . ' M.P. ' in the corner of a picture is delightful , but I want to break the mould : I do n't in the least insist on your giving specimens to others . And the artistic life , when you can lead another - if you 've any alternative , however modest - is a very poor business . It comes last in dignity - after everything else . Ai n't I up to my eyes in it and do n't I truly know ? "
181397	181407	181409	181409	Nick	224	" You talk like my broken - hearted mother , "
181411	181419	181218	181218	she	2497	" Does she hate it so intensely ? "
181420	181591	181218	181218	she	2497	" She has the darkest ideas about it - the wildest theories . I ca n't imagine where she gets them ; partly I think from a general conviction that the ' esthetic ' - a horrible insidious foreign disease - is eating the healthy core out of English life dear old English life ! and partly from the charming pictures in Punch and the clever satirical articles , pointing at mysterious depths of contamination , in the other weekly papers . She believes there 's a dreadful coterie of uncannily artful and desperately refined people who wear a kind of loose faded uniform and worship only beauty - which is a fearful thing ; that Gabriel has introduced me to it ; that I now spend all my time in it , and that for its sweet sake I 've broken the most sacred vows . Poor Gabriel , who , so far as I can make out , is n't in any sort of society , however bad ! "
181592	181599	181600	181600	Nash	147	" But I 'm uncannily artful , "
181603	181641	181600	181600	Nash	147	" and though I ca n't afford the uniform - I believe you get it best somewhere in South Audley Street - I do worship beauty . I really think it 's me the weekly papers mean . "
181642	181655	181657	181658	Basil Dashwood	276	" Oh I 've read the articles - I know the sort ! "
181665	181680	181660	181660	Miriam	170	" Go and see if the brougham 's there - I ordered it early . "
181690	181723	181724	181726	the young actor	2643	" It is n't time yet - I know more about the brougham than you . I 've made a ripping good arrangement for her stable - it really costs her nothing , "
181739	181751	181752	181752	Miriam	170	" Your mother 's quite right to be broken - hearted , "
181755	181782	181752	181752	Miriam	170	" and I can imagine exactly what she has been through . I should like to talk with her - I should like to see her . "
181895	181918	181880	181880	she	481	" I 've changed since that . I want you to be the grandest thing there is - the counsellor of kings . "
182056	182075	182076	182076	Nick	224	" Yet after all who 's more esthetic than you and who goes in more for the beautiful ? "
182079	182092	182076	182076	Nick	224	" You 're never so beautiful as when you pitch into it . "
182093	182136	182009	182009	she	138	" Oh , I 'm an inferior creature , of an inferior sex , and I 've to earn my bread as I can . I 'd give it all up in a moment , my odious trade - for an inducement . "
182137	182148	182149	182149	Nick	224	" And pray what do you mean by an inducement ? "
182152	182174	182175	182175	Gabriel	147	" My dear fellow , she means you - if you 'll give her a permanent engagement to sit for you ! "
182178	182186	182175	182175	Gabriel	147	" What singularly crude questions you ask ! "
182187	182195	182196	182197	Mr. Dashwood	276	" I like the way she talks , "
182201	182229	182196	182197	Mr. Dashwood	276	" when I gave up the most brilliant prospects , of very much the same kind as Mr. Dormer 's , expressly to go on the stage . "
182230	182238	182239	182239	Miriam	170	" You 're an inferior creature too , "
182243	182252	182253	182253	Peter	144	" Miss Rooth 's very hard to satisfy , "
182258	182317	182253	182253	Peter	144	" A man of distinction , slightly bald , in evening dress , with orders , in the corner of her loge - she has such a personage ready made to her hand and she does n't so much as look at him . Am I not an inducement ? Have n't I offered you a permanent engagement ? "
182318	182327	182328	182328	she	170	" Your orders - where are your orders ? "
182338	182365	182253	182253	Peter	144	" I shall be a minister next year and an ambassador before you know it . Then I shall stick on everything that can be had . "
182366	182373	182375	182376	the girl	481	" And they call us mountebanks ! "
182378	182395	182396	182396	she	170	" I 've been so glad to see you again - do you want another sitting ? "
182409	182425	182426	182426	he	224	" As many as you 'll give me - I shall be grateful for all , "
182430	182457	182426	182426	he	224	" I should like to do you as you are at present . You 're totally different from the woman I painted - you 're wonderful . "
182458	182463	182464	182464	she	170	" The Comic Muse ! "
182467	182513	182516	182516	she	170	" Well , you must wait till our first nights are over - I 'm sur les dents till then . There 's everything to do and I 've to do it all . That fellow 's good for nothing , for nothing but domestic life "
182522	182580	182516	182516	she	170	" He has n't an idea - not one you 'd willingly tell of him , though he 's rather useful for the stables . We 've got stables now - or we try to look as if we had : Dashwood 's ideas are de cette force . In ten days I shall have more time . "
182581	182590	182591	182591	Peter	144	" The Comic Muse ? Never , never , "
182594	182631	182591	182591	Peter	144	" You 're not to go smirking through the age and down to posterity - I 'd rather see you as Medusa crowned with serpents . That 's what you look like when you look best . "
182632	182673	182674	182674	Miriam	170	" That 's consoling - when I 've just bought a lovely new bonnet , all red roses and bows . I forgot to tell you just now that when you 're an ambassador you may propose anything you like , "
182678	182830	182674	182674	Miriam	170	" But forgive me if I make that condition . Seriously speaking , come to me glittering with orders and I shall probably succumb . I ca n't resist stars and garters . Only you must , as you say , have them all . I do n't like to hear Mr. Dormer talk the slang of the studio - like that phrase just now : it is a fall to a lower state . However , when one 's low one must crawl , and I 'm crawling down to the Strand . Dashwood , see if mamma 's ready . If she is n't I decline to wait ; you must bring her in a hansom . I 'll take Mr. Dormer in the brougham ; I want to talk with Mr. Dormer ; he must drive with me to the theatre . His situation 's full of interest . "
182967	182989	182948	182948	she	170	" Dear old master , are n't you coming to - night ? I miss you when you 're not there . "
182990	183004	183005	183005	Nash	147	" Do n't go - do n't go - it 's too much , "
183009	183014	183016	183017	Mr. Dashwood	276	" She is wonderful , "
183042	183042	183016	183017	Mr. Dashwood	276	"
183043	183053	183054	183054	Miriam	170	" Nothing puts it into you , my dear ! "
183063	183078	183058	183058	she	170	" You 're the faithful one - you 're the one I count on . "
183184	183197	183180	183180	she	170	" Do n't kill him - he does n't care for me ! "
183223	183244	183218	183218	Dashwood	276	" You would n't believe what I make him do the whole thing for - a little rascal I know . "
183245	183257	183259	183260	Gabriel Nash	147	" Good - bye ; take good care of Mrs. Rooth , "
184262	184265	184243	184243	she	170	" poetic drama "
184608	184619	184620	184624	the master of his fate	4249	" What is it you want ? Tell me now , "
184980	184999	185000	185000	Peter	144	" You know there are plenty of swamps and jungles , if you want that sort of thing , "
185020	185037	185016	185017	his chief	4265	" I 'll see - I 'll see . If anything turns up you shall hear . "
185099	185317	185322	185322	he	4272	" and the position , though high , not so exalted that there were not much greater altitudes above it to which it was a stepping - stone . Peter , quite ready to take one thing with another , rejoiced at his easy triumph , reflected that he must have been even more noticed at headquarters than he had hoped , and , on the spot , consulting nobody and waiting for nothing , signified his unqualified acceptance of the place . Nobody with a grain of sense would have advised him to do anything else . It made him happier than he had supposed he should ever be again ; it made him feel professionally in the train , as they said in Paris ; it was serious , it was interesting , it was exciting , and his imagination , letting itself loose into the future , began once more to scale the crowning eminence . It was very simple to hold one 's course if one really tried , and he blessed the variety of peoples . Further communications passed , the last enjoining on him to return to Paris for a short interval a week later , after which he would be advised of the date for his proceeding to his remoter duties .

185625	185629	185630	185630	she	140	" Dear child , "
185639	185668	185630	185630	she	140	" her only fault is after all that she adores her brother . She has a capacity for adoration and must always take her gospel from some one . "

186386	186398	186383	186383	she	132	" Oh you do n't know - you do n't know ! "

186481	186487	186488	186488	She	132	" you do n't know . "
186557	186571	186551	186551	she	132	" You do n't know what my life with my great husband was . "
186689	186705	186706	186706	Peter	144	" Do you really think he would have done such great things , politically speaking ? "
186709	186725	186706	186706	Peter	144	" Do you consider that the root of the matter was so essentially in him ? "
186738	186809	186810	186811	Lady Agnes	132	" I only think what all his friends - all his father 's friends - have thought . He was his father 's son after all . No young man ever had a finer training , and he gave from the first repeated proof of the highest ability , the highest ambition . See how he got in everywhere . Look at his first seat - look at his second , "
186814	186825	186810	186811	Lady Agnes	132	" Look at what every one says at this moment . "
186826	186833	186835	186835	Grace	140	" Look at all the papers ! "
186837	186845	186846	186846	she	132	" Did you ever hear him speak ? "
186874	186881	186870	186870	she	132	" Well , you lost something . "
186882	186888	186890	186891	Lady Agnes	132	" It was very charming , "
186896	186907	186908	186908	Peter	144	" Of course he 's charming , whatever he does , "
186911	186919	186908	186908	Peter	144	" He 'll be a charming artist . "
186920	186926	186927	186929	the poor lady	5744	" Oh God help us ! "
186935	186945	186946	186946	Grace	140	" He wo n't - that 's the worst , "
186949	186988	186946	186946	Grace	140	" It is n't as if he 'd do things people would like , I 've been to his place , and I never saw such a horrid lot of things - not at all clever or pretty . "
187003	187012	187014	187014	she	460	" You know nothing whatever about the matter ! "
187091	187106	187108	187108	Peter	144	" You think too much of the future - you take terribly gloomy views , "
187115	187133	187108	187108	Peter	144	" What other views can one take when one 's son has deliberately thrown away a fortune ? "
187134	187148	187073	187073	her	3140	" Thrown one away ? Do you mean through not marrying - - ? "
187149	187164	187108	187108	Peter	144	" I mean through killing by his perversity the best friend he ever had . "
187174	187184	187165	187165	Peter	144	" Ah but Julia is n't dead of it ! "
187185	187193	187195	187196	his aunt	4273	" I 'm not talking of Julia , "
187204	187218	187195	187196	his aunt	4273	" Nick is n't mercenary , and I 'm not complaining of that . "
187219	187225	187226	187226	Grace	140	" She means Mr. Carteret , "
187233	187247	187226	187226	Grace	140	" He 'd have done anything if Nick had stayed in the House . "
187248	187255	187226	187226	Grace	140	" But he 's not dead ? "
187256	187262	187264	187265	Lady Agnes	132	" Charles Carteret 's dying , "
187267	187311	187264	187265	Lady Agnes	132	" his end 's dreadfully near . He has been a sort of providence to us - he was Sir Nicholas 's second self . But he wo n't put up with such insanity , such wickedness , and that chapter 's closed . "
187312	187324	187226	187226	Grace	140	" You mean he has dropped Nick out of his will ? "
187325	187337	187264	187265	Lady Agnes	132	" Cut him off utterly . He has given him notice . "
187338	187343	187226	187226	Grace	140	" The old scoundrel ! "
187352	187368	187345	187345	Peter	144	" But Nick will work the better for that - he 'll depend on himself . "
187369	187379	187380	187380	Grace	140	" Yes , and whom shall we depend on ? "
187384	187395	187396	187397	her mother	460	" Do n't be vulgar , for God 's sake ! "
187404	187418	187419	187419	Peter	144	" Oh leave Nick alone - he 'll make a lot of money , "
187431	187445	187447	187448	Lady Agnes	132	" I do n't in the least care if he does or not , "
187450	187466	187467	187467	she	132	" You must come upstairs again - I 've lots to say to you yet , "
187478	187545	187467	187467	she	132	" You must arrange to come and dine with us immediately ; it 's only because I 've been so steeped in misery that I did n't write to you the other day - directly after you had called . We do n't give parties , as you may imagine , but if you 'll come just as we are , for old acquaintance ' sake - "
187546	187560	187561	187561	Grace	140	" Just with Nick - if Nick will come - and dear Biddy , "
187564	187584	187585	187585	Peter	144	" Nick must certainly come , as well as dear Biddy , whom I hoped so much to find , "
187588	187607	187585	187585	Peter	144	" Because I 'm going away - I do n't know when I , shall see them again . "
187608	187622	187623	187623	Grace	140	" Wait with mamma . Biddy will come in now at any moment , "
187626	187632	187634	187635	Lady Agnes	132	" You 're going away ? "
187666	187706	187654	187654	her	132	" I 've had promotion and you must congratulate me . They 're sending me out as minister to a little hot hole in Central America - six thousand miles away . I shall have to go rather soon . "
187707	187714	187715	187716	Lady Agnes	132	" Oh I 'm so glad ! "
187733	187751	187752	187752	Grace	140	" How very delightful - it will lead straight off to all sorts of other good things ! "
187758	187770	187771	187771	Peter	144	" Oh I 'm crawling up - I 'm an excellency , "
187774	187791	187771	187771	Peter	144	" Then if you dine with us your excellency must have great people to meet you . "
187792	187802	187771	187771	Peter	144	" Nick and Biddy - they 're great enough . "
187803	187810	187812	187813	Lady Agnes	132	" Come upstairs - come upstairs , "
187822	187832	187833	187833	Grace	140	" Wait for Biddy - I 'm going out , "
187843	187865	187866	187867	the girl	481	" I shall see you again - not that you care ; but good - bye now . Wait for Biddy , "
187893	187905	187906	187906	he	4330	" Oh I 'll go and see her in Rosedale Road , "
187910	187920	187875	187875	her	481	" Do you mean to - day - now ? "
187921	187937	187875	187875	her	481	" I do n't know about to - day , but before I leave England . "
187938	187947	187949	187949	Grace	140	" Well , she 'll be in immediately , "
187951	187959	187949	187949	Grace	140	" Good - bye to your excellency . "
187960	187970	187972	187973	Lady Agnes	132	" Come up , Peter - please come up , "
188214	188224	188225	188225	he	144	" Where 's Grace going in such a hurry ? "
188548	188599	188648	188648	she	132	" Oh Peter , take little Biddy ; oh my dear young friend , understand your interests at the same time that you understand mine ; be kind and reasonable and clever ; save me all further anxiety and tribulation and accept my lovely , faultless child from my hands . "
189108	189133	189134	189134	Julia	138	" She 'll save you disappointments ; you 'd know the worst that can happen to you , and it would n't be bad . "
190310	190322	190323	190323	she	170	" I want you to see and judge and tell me , "
190326	190343	190323	190323	she	170	" for my mind 's like a flogged horse - it wo n't give another kick . "
190744	190760	190739	190739	she	170	" Ah but wait till you see how I shall do it at the time ! "
191541	191548	191549	191549	she	481	" Is n't he too lovely , "
191552	191563	191549	191549	she	481	" and does n't he know how to do it ? "
191687	191706	191665	191667	their young woman	4413	" Oh he says he does n't like the kitchen - fire - he only wants the pudding ! "
191970	191987	191988	191988	He	144	" Fancy my having to drag through that other stuff to - night - the brutes ! "
192282	192293	192294	192294	Miriam	170	" Come and see me three or four hours hence , "
192297	192342	192294	192294	Miriam	170	" come , that is , about six . I shall rest till then , but I want particularly to talk with you . There will be no one else - not the tip of any tiresome nose . You 'll do me good . "
192353	192376	192381	192381	he	144	" I do n't know ; I have n't the least idea ; I do n't care ; do n't ask me ! "
192475	192486	192487	192487	she	170	" You 're tired of me - yes , already , "
192514	192573	192504	192504	she	460	" However , it does n't matter and of course your head 's full of other things . You must think me ravenously selfish - perpetually chattering about my vulgar shop . What will you have when one 's a vulgar shop - girl ? You used to like it , but then you were n't an ambassador . "
192574	192585	192586	192586	he	4426	" What do you know about my being a minister ? "
192727	192747	192748	192748	Miriam	170	" I should know very little if I waited for you to tell me - that 's very certain , "
192751	192847	192748	192748	Miriam	170	" It 's in the papers that you 've got a high appointment , but I do n't read the papers unless there 's something in them about myself . Next week I shall devour them and think them , no doubt , inane . It was Basil told me this afternoon of your promotion - he had seen it announced somewhere , I 'm delighted if it gives you more money and more advantages , but do n't expect me to be glad that you 're going away to some distant , disgusting country . "
192848	192878	192879	192879	Peter	144	" The matter has only just been settled and we 've each been busy with our own affairs . But even if you had n't given me these opportunities , "
192883	192906	192879	192879	Peter	144	" I should have tried to see you to - day , to tell you my news and take leave of you . "
192907	192919	192879	192879	Peter	144	" Take leave ? Are n't you coming to - morrow ? "
192920	192943	192879	192879	Peter	144	" Oh yes , I shall see you through that . But I shall rush away the very moment it 's over . "
192944	192956	192957	192958	the girl	481	" I shall be much better then - really I shall , "
192961	192971	192879	192879	Peter	144	" The better you are the worse you are . "
192981	192994	192972	192972	She	481	" If it would do you any good I 'd be bad . "
192995	193005	193006	193006	Peter	144	" The worse you are the better you are ! "
193009	193016	193006	193006	Peter	144	" You 're a devouring demon . "
193017	193026	192879	192879	Peter	144	" Not a bit ! It 's you . "
193027	193036	193006	193006	Peter	144	" It 's I ? I like that . "
193037	193163	193164	193165	the girl	481	" It 's you who make trouble , who are sore and suspicious and supersubtle , not taking things as they come and for what they are , but twisting them into misery and falsity . Oh I 've watched you enough , my dear friend , and I 've been sorry for you - and sorry as well for myself ; for I 'm not so taken up with myself , in the low greedy sense , as you think . I 'm not such a base creature . I 'm capable of gratitude , I 'm capable of affection . One may live in paint and tinsel , but one is n't absolutely without a soul . Yes , I 've got one , "
193169	193401	193164	193165	the girl	481	" though I do smear my face and grin at myself in the glass and practise my intonations . If what you 're going to do is good for you I 'm very glad . If it leads to good things , to honour and fortune and greatness , I 'm enchanted . If it means your being away always , for ever and ever , of course that 's serious . You know it - I need n't tell you - I regard you as I really do n't regard any one else . I 've a confidence in you - ah it 's a luxury ! You 're a gentleman , mon bon - ah you 're a gentleman ! It 's just that . And then you see , you understand , and that 's a luxury too . You 're a luxury altogether , dear clever Mr. Sherringham . Your being where I shall never see you is n't a thing I shall enjoy ; I know that from the separation of these last months - after our beautiful life in Paris , the best thing that ever happened to me or that ever will . But if it 's your career , if it 's your happiness - well , I can miss you and hold my tongue . I can be disinterested - I can ! "
193402	193412	193413	193413	he	4431	" What did you want me to come for ? "
193571	193768	193786	193786	Miriam	170	" at the last . Then she had heard from Dashwood of the change in his situation , and that had really from one moment to the other made her think sympathetically of his preoccupations - led her open - handedly to drop her own . She was sorry to lose him and eager to let him know how good a friend she was conscious he had been to her . But the expression of this was already , at the end of a minute , a strange bedevilment : she began to listen to herself , to speak dramatically , to represent . She uttered the things she felt as if they were snatches of old play - books , and really felt them the more because they sounded so well . This , however , did n't prevent their really being as good feelings as those of anybody else , and at the moment her friend , to still a rising emotion - which he knew he should n't still - articulated the challenge I have just recorded , she had for his sensibility , at any rate , the truth of gentleness and generosity .
193769	193785	193786	193786	Miriam	170	" There 's something the matter with you , my dear - you 're jealous , "
193789	193822	193786	193786	Miriam	170	" You 're jealous of poor Mr. Dormer . That 's an example of the way you tangle everything up . Lord , he wo n't hurt you , nor me either ! "
193823	193832	193833	193833	Peter	144	" He ca n't hurt me , certainly , "
193836	193890	193833	193833	Peter	144	" and neither can you ; for I 've a nice little heart of stone and a smart new breastplate of iron . The interest I take in you is something quite extraordinary ; but the most extraordinary thing in it is that it 's perfectly prepared to tolerate the interest of others . "
193891	193902	193903	193903	Miriam	170	" The interest of others need n't trouble it much ! "
193906	194088	193903	193903	Miriam	170	" If Mr. Dormer has broken off his marriage to such an awfully fine woman - for she 's that , your swell of a sister - it is n't for a ranting wretch like me . He 's kind to me because that 's his nature and he notices me because that 's his business ; but he 's away up in the clouds - a thousand miles over my head . He has got something ' on , ' as they say ; he 's in love with an idea . I think it 's a shocking bad one , but that 's his own affair . He 's quite exaltĂ ; living on nectar and ambrosia - what he has to spare for us poor crawling things on earth is only a few dry crumbs . I did n't even ask him to come to rehearsal . Besides , he thinks you 're in love with me and that it would n't be honourable to cut in . He 's capable of that - is n't it charming ? "
194089	194105	194106	194106	Peter	144	" If he were to relent and give up his scruples would you marry him ? "
194109	194120	194121	194122	the girl	481	" Mercy , how you chatter about ' marrying ' ! "
194125	194140	194121	194122	the girl	481	" C'est la maladie anglaise - you 've all got it on the brain . "
194141	194152	194153	194153	he	144	" Why I put it that way to please you , "
194156	194173	194153	194153	he	144	" You complained to me last year precisely that this was not what seemed generally wanted . "
194174	194179	194181	194181	she	481	" Oh last year ! "
194190	194198	194199	194199	she	481	" Yes , it 's very tiresome ! "
194202	194224	194153	194153	he	144	" You told me , moreover , in Paris more than once that you would n't listen to anything but that . "
194225	194228	194229	194229	she	481	" Well , "
194232	194294	194229	194229	she	481	" I wo n't , but I shall wait till I find a husband who 's charming enough and bad enough . One who 'll beat me and swindle me and spend my money on other women - that 's the sort of man for me . Mr. Dormer , delightful as he is , does n't come up to that . "
194295	194302	194303	194303	He	4437	" You 'll marry Basil Dashwood . "
194309	194339	194153	194153	he	144	" Oh ' marry ' ? - call it marry if you like . That 's what poor mother threatens me with - she lives in dread of it . "
194340	194345	194346	194346	he	4437	" To this hour , "
194349	194373	194346	194346	he	4437	" I have n't managed to make out what your mother wants . She has so many ideas , as Madame CarrĂ said . "
194374	194543	194544	194544	Miriam	170	" She wants me to be some sort of tremendous creature - all her ideas are reducible to that . What makes the muddle is that she is n't clear about the creature she wants most . A great actress or a great lady - sometimes she inclines for one and sometimes for the other , but on the whole persuading herself that a great actress , if she 'll cultivate the right people , may be a great lady . When I tell her that wo n't do and that a great actress can never be anything but a great vagabond , then the dear old thing has tantrums , and we have scenes - the most grotesque : they 'd make the fortune , for a subject , of some play - writing rascal , if he had the wit to guess them ; which , luckily for us perhaps , he never will . She usually winds up by protesting - devinez un peu quoi ! "
194558	194573	194552	194552	his	505	" By declaring that rather than take it that way I must marry you . "
194574	194582	194583	194583	Peter	144	" She 's shrewder than I thought , "
194586	194619	194583	194583	Peter	144	" It 's the last of vanities to talk about , but I may state in passing that if you 'd marry me you should be the greatest of all possible ladies . "
194628	194646	194620	194620	She	170	" Lord o ' mercy , my dear fellow , what natural capacity have I for that ? "
194647	194685	194686	194686	he	144	" You 're artist enough for anything . I shall be a great diplomatist : my resolution 's firmly taken , I 'm infinitely cleverer than you have the least idea of , and you shall be , "
194690	194697	194686	194686	he	144	" a great diplomatist 's wife . "
194698	194743	194744	194744	she	170	" And the demon , the devil , the devourer and destroyer , that you are so fond of talking about : what , in such a position , do you do with that element of my nature ? Ou le fourrez - vous ? "
194752	194786	194686	194686	he	144	" I 'll look after it , I 'll keep it under . Rather perhaps I should say I 'll bribe it and amuse it ; I 'll gorge it with earthly grandeurs . "
194787	194792	194794	194794	Miriam	170	" That 's better , "
194796	194817	194794	194794	Miriam	170	" for a demon that 's kept under is a shabby little demon . Do n't let 's be shabby . "
194822	194834	194819	194819	she	170	" Do you really go away the beginning of next week ? "
194835	194841	194686	194686	he	144	" Monday night if possible . "
194842	194865	194819	194819	she	170	" Ah that 's but to Paris . Before you go to your new post they must give you an interval here . "
194866	194891	194892	194892	he	4439	" I sha n't take it - I 'm so tremendously keen for my duties . I shall insist on going sooner . Oh , "
194896	194903	194892	194892	he	4439	" I shall be concentrated now . "
194904	194912	194913	194913	She	170	" I 'll come and act there . "
194924	194939	194940	194940	she	170	" I 've already forgotten what it was I wanted to discuss with you , "
194943	195111	194940	194940	she	170	" it was some trumpery stuff . What I want to say now is only one thing : that it 's not in the least true that because my life pitches me in every direction and mixes me up with all sorts of people - or rather with one sort mainly , poor dears ! - I have n't a decent character , I have n't common honesty . Your sympathy , your generosity , your patience , your precious suggestions , our dear sweet days last summer in Paris , I shall never forget . You 're the best - you 're different from all the others . Think of me as you please and make profane jokes about my mating with a disguised ' Arty ' - I shall think of you only in one way . I 've a great respect for you . With all my heart I hope you 'll be a great diplomatist . God bless you , dear clever man . "
195187	195249	195250	195250	he	4441	" You 'll have to go , to reach the theatre at your usual hour , wo n't you ? Let me not keep you . That is , let me keep you only long enough just to say this , once for all , as I shall never speak of it again . I 'm going away to save myself , "
195265	195385	195250	195250	he	4441	" I ought to go , no doubt , in silence , in decorum , in virtuous submission to hard necessity - without asking for credit or sympathy , without provoking any sort of scene or calling attention to my fortitude . But I ca n't - upon my soul I ca n't . I can go , I can see it through , but I ca n't hold my tongue . I want you to know all about it , so that over there , when I 'm bored to death , I shall at least have the exasperatingly vain consolation of feeling that you do know - and that it does neither you nor me any good ! "
195401	195410	195398	195398	she	4440	" That I ' do know ' what ? "
195411	195426	195533	195533	she	4440	" That I 've a consuming passion for you and that it 's impossible . "
195427	195434	195435	195435	she	4440	" Oh impossible , my friend ! "
195446	195484	195443	195443	her	4440	" Very good ; it interferes , the gratification of it would interfere fatally , with the ambition of each of us . Our ambitions are inferior and odious , but we 're tied fast to them . "
195485	195493	195494	195494	she	4440	" Ah why ai n't we simple ? "
195503	195527	195494	195494	she	4440	" Why ai n't we of the people - comme tout le monde - just a man and a girl liking each other ? "
195543	195640	195533	195533	she	4440	" Because we 're precious asses ! However , I 'm simple enough , after all , to care for you as I 've never cared for any human creature . You have , as it happens , a personal charm for me that no one has ever approached , and from the top of your splendid head to the sole of your theatrical shoe I could go down on my face - there , abjectly - and kiss it ! every inch of you is dear and delightful to me . Therefore good - bye . "
195739	195850	195851	195851	She	4440	" I 'm so glad you 've said all that , for from you I know what it means . Certainly it 's better for you to go away . Of course it 's all wrong , is n't it ? - but that 's the only thing it can be : therefore it 's all right , is n't it ? Some day when we 're both great people we 'll talk these things over ; then we shall be quiet , we shall be rich , we shall be at peace - let us hope so at least - and better friends than others about us will know . "
195866	195878	195851	195851	She	4440	" Do n't , do n't come to - morrow night . "
195954	195962	195944	195944	he	4441	" I love you , you know , "
196085	196091	196079	196079	her	178	" Oh you extravagant children ! "
196102	196117	196092	196092	Miriam	170	" He 's going away , the wretch ; he 's bidding us farewell . "
196134	196136	196137	196137	he	144	" us "
196153	196165	196166	196166	She	178	" Going away ? Ah then I must have one too ! "
196198	196210	196195	196195	she	178	" Our dear old friend - our kind , gallant gentleman ! "
196211	196230	196231	196231	Miriam	170	" The gallant gentleman has been promoted to a great post - the proper reward of his gallantry , "
196234	196250	196231	196231	Miriam	170	" He 's going out as minister to some impossible place - where is it ? "
196251	196264	196266	196267	their companion	590	" As minister - how very charming ! We are getting on . "
196278	196291	196292	196292	he	4449	" Oh well enough . One must take what one can get , "
196295	196310	196311	196312	Mrs. Rooth	178	" You 'll get everything now , I 'm sure , sha n't you ? "
196346	196391	196392	196392	Miriam	170	" He 's going to glory and he 'll forget all about us - forget he has ever known such low people . So we shall never see him again , and it 's better so . Good - bye , good - bye , "
196395	196445	196446	196446	she	170	" the brougham must be there , but I wo n't take you . I want to talk to mother about you , and we shall say things not fit for you to hear . Oh I 'll let you know what we lose - do n't be afraid , "
196452	196461	196446	196446	she	170	" He 's the rising star of diplomacy . "
196462	196482	196484	196486	the old woman	1320	" I knew it from the first - I know how things turn out for such people as you ! "
196493	196510	196484	196486	the old woman	1320	" But you do n't mean to say you 're not coming to - morrow night ? "
196511	196523	196524	196524	Miriam	170	" Do n't - do n't ; it 's great folly , "
196527	196542	196524	196524	Miriam	170	" and it 's quite needless , since you saw me to - day . "
196562	196592	196543	196543	Peter	144	" Oh you dear rogue , to say one has seen you yet ! You know how you 'll come up to it - you 'll be beyond everything . "
196593	196603	196604	196604	Peter	144	" Yes , I shall be there - certainly , "
196615	196621	196622	196622	Miriam	170	" Oh you dreadful goose ! "
197612	197614	197625	197625	he	224	" toned "
197739	197741	197751	197751	they	4473	" politics "
199055	199100	199101	199101	Peter	144	" My dear fellow , it 's an unpardonable hour , is n't it ? I was n't even sure you 'd be up , yet had to risk it , because my hours are numbered . I 'm going away to - morrow , "
199105	199169	199101	199101	Peter	144	" I 've a thousand things to do . I 've had no talk with you this time such as we used to have of old it 's an irreparable loss , but it 's your fault , you know , and as I 've got to rush about all day I thought I 'd just catch you before any one else does . "
199170	199185	199186	199186	Nick	224	" Some one has already caught me , but there 's plenty of time , "
199200	199221	199189	199189	Peter	144	" I see , I see . I 'm sorry to say I 've only a few minutes at best . "
199222	199235	199236	199237	his companion	647	" Man of crushing responsibilities , you 've come to humiliate me ! "
199240	199247	199236	199237	his companion	647	" I know all about it . "
199248	199312	199189	199189	Peter	144	" It 's more than I do then . That 's not what I 've come for , but I shall be delighted if I humiliate you a little by the way . I 've two things in mind , and I 'll mention the most difficult first . I came here the other day - the day after my arrival in town . "
199313	199327	199329	199329	Nick	224	" Ah yes , so you did ; it was very good of you "
199332	199379	199329	199329	Nick	224	" I ought to have returned your visit or left a card or written my name - to have done something in Great Stanhope Street , ought n't I ? You had n't got this new thing then , or I 'd have ' called . ' "
199386	199407	199380	199380	Peter	144	" I say , what 's the matter with you ? Am I really unforgivable for having taken that liberty ? "
199408	199412	199413	199413	Nick	224	" What liberty ? "
199742	199755	199756	199756	Peter	144	" I pitched into your treasures - I rummaged among your canvases , "
199759	199918	199756	199756	Peter	144	" Biddy had nothing whatever to do with it - she maintained an attitude of irreproachable reserve . It has been on my conscience all these days and I ought to have done penance before . I 've been putting it off partly because I 'm so ashamed of my indiscretion . Que voulez - vous , my dear chap ? My provocation was great . I heard you had been painting Miss Rooth , so that I could n't restrain my curiosity . I simply went into that corner and struck out there - a trifle wildly no doubt . I dragged the young lady to the light - your sister turned pale as she saw me . It was a good deal like breaking open one of your letters , was n't it ? However , I assure you it 's all right , for I congratulate you both on your style and on your correspondent . "
199919	199936	199937	199937	Nick	224	" You 're as clever , as witty , as humorous as ever , old boy , "
199958	199984	199985	199985	Nick	224	" Your curiosity 's the highest possible tribute to my little attempt and your sympathy sets me right with myself . There she is again , "
199997	200009	199985	199985	Nick	224	" you shall see her whether you wish to or not . "
200010	200026	200027	200027	Peter	144	" Right with yourself ? You do n't mean to say you 've been wrong ! "
200035	200058	199985	199985	Nick	224	" Oh I do n't know . I 've been kicking up such a row . Anything 's better than a row . "
200059	200070	200072	200072	Peter	144	" She 's awfully good - she 's awfully true , "
200074	200093	200072	200072	Peter	144	" You 've done more to her since the other day . You 've put in several things . "
200094	200120	199985	199985	Nick	224	" Yes , but I 've worked distractedly . I 've not altogether conformed to the good rule about being off with the old love . "
200121	200127	200130	200131	the visitor	2163	" With the old love ? "
200138	200147	200130	200131	the visitor	2163	" Before you 're on with the new ! "
200178	200368	200173	200173	He	224	" It is n't so easy to cease to represent an affectionate constituency . Really most of my time for a fortnight has been given to letter - writing . They 've all been unexpectedly charming . I should have thought they 'd have loathed and despised me . But not a bit of it ; they cling to me fondly - they struggle with me tenderly . I 've been down to talk with them about it , and we 've passed the most sociable , delightful hours . I 've designated my successor ; I 've felt a good deal like the Emperor Charles the Fifth when about to retire to the monastery of Yuste . The more I 've seen of them in this way the more I 've liked them , and they declare it has been the same with themselves about me . We spend our time assuring each other we had n't begun to know each other till now . In short it 's all wonderfully jolly , but it is n't business . C'est magnifique , mais ce n'est pas la guerre . "
200369	200392	200575	200575	he	144	" They 're not so charming as they might be if they do n't offer to keep you and let you paint . "
200393	200403	200405	200405	Nick	224	" They do , almost - it 's fantastic , "
200407	200420	200405	200405	Nick	224	" Remember they have n't yet seen a daub of my brush . "
200421	200438	200439	200439	Peter	144	" Well , I 'm sorry for you ; we live in too enlightened an age , "
200442	200484	200439	200439	Peter	144	" You ca n't suffer for art - that grand romance is over . Your experience is interesting ; it seems to show that at the tremendous pitch of civilisation we 've reached you ca n't suffer from anything but hunger . "
200485	200490	200491	200491	Nick	224	" I shall doubtless , "
200494	200505	200491	200491	Nick	224	" do that enough to make up for the rest . "
200506	200519	200439	200439	Peter	144	" Never , never , when you paint so well as this . "
200520	200532	200533	200533	Nick	224	" Oh come , you 're too good to be true , "
200536	200557	200533	200533	Nick	224	" But where did you learn that one 's larder 's full in proportion as one 's work 's fine ? "
200580	200593	200575	200575	he	144	" I 'll give you your price for it on the spot . "
200594	200608	200610	200610	Nick	224	" Ah you 're so magnanimous that you shall have it for nothing ! "
200629	200637	200624	200624	Peter	144	" Why do you call me magnanimous ? "
200638	200651	200653	200653	Nick	224	" Oh bless my soul , it 's hers - I forgot ! "
200666	200673	200653	200653	Nick	224	" But you shall have another . "
200674	200684	200624	200624	Peter	144	" Another ? Are you going to do another ? "
200685	200715	200653	200653	Nick	224	" This very morning . That is , I shall begin it . I 've heard from her ; she 's coming to sit - a short time hence . "
200764	200816	200817	200817	he	144	" The more you do her the better - she has all the qualities of a great model . From that point of view it 's a pity she has another trade : she might make so good a thing of this one . But how shall you do her again ? "
200821	200904	200905	200905	Nick	224	" Oh I can scarcely say ; we 'll arrange something ; we 'll talk it over . It 's extraordinary how well she enters into what one wants : she knows more than one does one 's self . She is n't , as you Frenchmen say , the first comer . However , you know all about that , since you invented her , did n't you ? That 's what she says ; she 's awfully sweet on you , "
200909	201025	200905	200905	Nick	224	" What I ought to do is to try something as different as possible from that thing ; not the sibyl , the muse , the tremendous creature , but the charming woman , the person one knows , differently arranged as she appears en ville , she calls it . I 'll do something really serious and send it to you out there with my respects . It will remind you of home and perhaps a little even of me . If she knows it 's for you she 'll throw herself into it in the right spirit . Leave it to us , my dear fellow ; we 'll turn out something splendid . "
201026	201042	201044	201044	Peter	144	" It 's jolly to hear you , but I shall send you a cheque , "
201048	201065	201066	201067	his kinsman	802	" I suppose it 's all right in your position , but you 're too proud , "
201070	201079	200905	200905	Nick	224	" What do you mean by my position ? "
201080	201112	201066	201067	his kinsman	802	" Your exaltation , your high connexion with the country , your treating with sovereign powers as the representative of a sovereign power . Is n't that what they call 'em ? "
201141	201144	201145	201145	he	144	" Brute ! "
201160	201170	201145	201145	he	144	" When did you say you expect your sitter ? "
201171	201193	201133	201133	he	144	" Oh we 've plenty of time ; do n't be afraid of letting me see you agitated by her presence . "
201194	201197	201198	201198	Peter	144	" Brute ! "
201215	201224	201226	201226	Nick	224	" Stay with me and talk to me , "
201228	201257	201226	201226	Nick	224	" I daresay it 's good for me . It may be the last time I shall see you without having before anything else to koo - too . "
201258	201261	201133	201133	he	144	" Beast ! "
201280	201298	201133	201133	he	144	" Have n't you something more to show me then - some other fruit of your genius ? "
201299	201416	201226	201226	Nick	224	" Must I bribe you by setting my sign - boards in a row ? You know what I 've done ; by which I mean of course you know what I have n't . My genius , as you 're so good as to call it , has hitherto been dreadfully sterile . I 've had no time , no opportunity , no continuity . I must go and sit down in a corner and learn my alphabet . That thing is n't good ; what I shall do for you wo n't be good . Do n't protest , my dear fellow ; nothing will be fit to look at for a long time . "
201424	201457	201420	201420	Nick	224	" And think of my ridiculous age ! As the good people say or do n't they say it ? , it 's a rum go . It wo n't be amusing . "
201458	201470	201471	201471	Peter	144	" Ah you 're so clever you 'll get on fast , "
201489	201500	201502	201502	Nick	224	" I mean it wo n't be amusing for others , "
201509	201520	201502	201502	Nick	224	" They want results , and small blame to them . "
201521	201536	201537	201537	Peter	144	" Well , whatever you do , do n't talk like Mr. Gabriel Nash , "
201541	201551	201537	201537	Peter	144	" Sometimes I think you 're just going to . "
201557	201584	201552	201552	Nick	224	" Ah he never would have said that ' They want results , the damned asses ' - that would have been more in his key . "
201585	201600	201601	201601	Peter	144	" It 's the difference of a nuance ! And are you extraordinarily happy ? "
201625	201670	201552	201552	Nick	224	" Not so much so , doubtless , as the artistic life ought to make one : because all one 's people are not so infatuated as one 's electors . But little by little I 'm learning the charm of pig - headedness . "
201671	201678	201679	201679	Peter	144	" Your mother 's very bad , "
201682	201691	201679	201679	Peter	144	" I lunched with her day before yesterday . "
201692	201700	201702	201702	Nick	224	" Yes , I know , I know "
201709	201740	201702	201702	Nick	224	" but it 's too late , too late . I must just peg away here and not mind . I 've after all a great advantage in my life . "
201748	201755	201741	201742	His companion	647	" And that would be - ? "
201756	201773	201679	201679	Peter	144	" Well , knowing what I want to do . That 's everything , you know . "
201774	201795	201741	201742	His companion	647	" It 's an advantage , however , that you 've only just come in for , is n't it ? "
201796	201831	201679	201679	Peter	144	" Yes , but the delay and the probation only make me prize it the more . I 've got it now ; and it makes up for the absence of some other things . "
201838	201845	201846	201846	he	144	" That sounds a little flat , "
201851	201875	201741	201742	His companion	647	" It depends on what you compare it with . It has more point than I sometimes found in the House of Commons . "
201876	201886	201741	201742	His companion	647	" Oh I never thought I should like that ! "
202004	202012	201986	201986	he	144	" Have you heard anything from Julia ? "
202013	202021	202070	202072	her late intended	4544	" Not a syllable . Have you ? "
202022	202032	201986	201986	he	144	" Dear no ; she never writes to me . "
202033	202045	202070	202072	her late intended	4544	" But wo n't she on the occasion of your promotion ? "
202046	202051	202053	202053	Peter	144	" I daresay not , "
202507	202538	202492	202492	Nick	224	" I see what you mean - I 'm very sorry too . I 'm sorry you ca n't give my mother this joy - I give her so little . "
202539	202552	202556	202556	Peter	144	" My dear fellow , you might give her a little more ! "
202560	202576	202556	202556	Peter	144	" It 's rather too much to expect me to make up for your omissions ! "
202603	202631	202596	202596	he	224	" There 's a way you could do that , to a considerable extent - I think you guess it - which would n't be intrinsically disagreeable . "
202648	202671	202643	202643	he	224	" You can make this all clear to Biddy when she comes , and she 'll make it clear to my mother . "
202672	202677	202678	202678	Peter	144	" Poor little Biddy ! "
202762	202773	202775	202775	Nick	224	" Patience , patience then - you 've always me ! "
202782	202817	202775	202775	Nick	224	" If it 's a question of going to the play I scarcely see why you should n't dine at my mother 's all the same . People go to the play after dinner . "
202818	202852	202853	202853	Peter	144	" Yes , but it would n't be fair , it would n't be decent : it 's a case when I must be in my seat from the rise of the curtain . "
202862	202915	202916	202916	he	144	" I should force your mother to dine an hour earlier than usual and then in return for her courtesy should go off to my entertainment at eight o'clock , leaving her and Grace and Biddy languishing there . I wish I had proposed in time that they should go with me , "
202922	202929	202930	202930	Nick	224	" You might do that still , "
202933	202949	202992	202992	He	144	" Oh at this time of day it would be impossible to get a box . "
202950	202966	202968	202968	Nick	224	" I 'll speak to Miss Rooth about it if you like when she comes , "
202970	202978	202980	202980	Peter	144	" No , it would n't do , "
203079	203084	203087	203087	Peter	144	" Your own freedom ? "
203094	203107	203087	203087	Peter	144	" Why you see now I can go to the theatre myself . "
203108	203125	203087	203087	Peter	144	" Certainly ; I had n't thought of that . You 'd naturally have been going . "
203126	203140	203087	203087	Peter	144	" I gave it up for the prospect of your company at home . "
203141	203157	203159	203159	Peter	144	" Upon my word you 're too good - I do n't deserve such sacrifices , "
203181	203211	203212	203212	he	144	" Did n't it , however , occur to you that , as it would turn out , I might - I even naturally would - myself be going ? "
203222	203237	203216	203216	Nick	224	" It would have occurred to me if I understood a little better - ! "
203247	203256	203239	203239	he	224	" If you understood a little better what ? "
203257	203263	203239	203239	he	224	" Your situation , simply . "
203271	203299	203264	203264	Peter	144	" Dine with me to - night by ourselves and at a club . We 'll go to the theatre together and then you 'll understand it . "
203300	203314	203316	203316	Nick	224	" With pleasure , with pleasure : we 'll have a jolly evening , "
203318	203334	203335	203335	Peter	144	" Call it jolly if you like . When did you say she was coming ? "
203338	203353	203239	203239	he	224	" Biddy ? Oh probably , as I tell you , at any moment . "
203354	203361	203362	203362	Peter	144	" I mean the great Miriam , "
203365	203383	203239	203239	he	224	" The great Miriam , if she 's punctual , will be here in about forty minutes . "
203384	203395	203239	203239	he	224	" And will she be likely to find your sister ? "
203396	203414	203239	203239	he	224	" That will depend , my dear fellow , on whether my sister remains to see her . "
203415	203434	203239	203239	he	224	" Exactly ; but the point 's whether you 'll allow her to remain , is n't it ? "
203440	203450	203435	203435	Nick	224	" Why should n't she do as she likes ? "
203451	203460	203239	203239	he	224	" In that case she 'll probably go . "
203461	203468	203435	203435	Nick	224	" Yes , unless she stays . "
203469	203475	203476	203476	Peter	144	" Do n't let her , "
203484	203492	203476	203476	Peter	144	" And to explain this he added : "
203517	203536	203508	203515	Bid meeting des femmes de thĂ Ă tre	4554	" His explanation , in turn , struck him as requiring another clause ; so he went on : "
203561	203561	203569	203569	his	224	"
203597	203634	203590	203590	Nick	224	" Why , you originally introduced them in Paris , Biddy and Miss Rooth . Did n't they meet at your rooms and fraternise , and was n't that much more ' abroad ' than this ? "
203635	203653	203654	203654	Peter	144	" So they did , but my hand had been forced and she did n't like it , "
203666	203674	203675	203675	Nick	224	" Miss Rooth did n't like it ? "
203678	203708	203590	203590	Nick	224	" That I confess I 've forgotten . Besides , she was n't an actress then . What I mean is that Biddy was n't particularly pleased with her . "
203709	203726	203590	203590	Nick	224	" Why she thought her wonderful - praised her to the sides . I remember that . "
203727	203744	203590	203590	Nick	224	" She did n't like her as a woman ; she praised her as an actress . "
203745	203757	203758	203758	Nick	224	" I thought you said she was n't an actress then , "
203766	203793	203761	203761	Peter	144	" Oh Biddy thought so . She has seen her since , moreover . I took her the other night , and her curiosity 's satisfied . "
203794	203817	203818	203818	Nick	224	" It 's not of any consequence , and if there 's a reason for it I 'll bundle her off directly , "
203824	203837	203818	203818	Nick	224	" But the great Miriam seems such a kind , good person . "
203838	203847	203850	203851	his visitor	1421	" So she is , charming , charming , "
203857	203863	203864	203864	Nick	224	" Here comes Biddy now , "
203868	203882	203864	203864	Nick	224	" I hear her at the door : you can warn her yourself . "
203883	203910	203912	203912	Peter	144	" It is n't a question of ' warning ' - that 's not in the least my idea . But I 'll take Biddy away , "
203914	203922	203864	203864	Nick	224	" That will be still more energetic . "
203923	203938	203939	203939	Peter	144	" No , it will be simply more selfish - I like her company . "
203987	203995	203997	203997	Nick	224	" Come on boldly , my dear , "
203999	204009	203997	203997	Nick	224	" Peter 's bored to death waiting for you . "
204010	204027	204031	204031	her	134	" Ah he 's come to say he wo n't dine with us to - night ! "
204037	204060	204062	204062	Peter	144	" I leave town to - morrow : I 've everything to do ; I 'm broken - hearted ; it 's impossible "
204074	204095	204071	204071	he	144	" Please make my peace with your mother - I 'm ashamed of not having written to her last night . "
204110	204120	204096	204096	She	134	" How in the world did you guess it ? "
204121	204130	204132	204132	she	134	" I saw it in the Morning Post . "
204140	204146	204147	204147	he	144	" In the Morning Post ? "
204151	204184	204096	204096	She	134	" I saw there 's to be a first night at that theatre , the one you took us to . So I said , ' Oh he 'll go there . ' "
204185	204196	204197	204197	Peter	144	" Yes , I 've got to do that too , "
204200	204230	204231	204231	Nick	224	" She 's going to sit to me again this morning , his wonderful actress - she has made an appointment : so you see I 'm getting on , "
204237	204249	204250	204251	The girl	481	" Oh I 'm so glad - she 's so splendid ! "
204278	204293	204294	204294	Peter	144	" I 'm delighted you 've come in . I have waited for you , "
204311	204321	204360	204360	she	134	" Are n't you coming to see us again ? "
204322	204348	204360	204360	she	134	" I 'm in despair , but I shall really not have time . Therefore it 's a blessing not to have missed you here . "
204349	204355	204357	204357	Biddy	134	" I 'm very glad , "
204363	204377	204360	204360	she	134	" And you 're going to America - to stay a long time ? "
204378	204388	204360	204360	she	134	" Till I 'm sent to some better place . "
204389	204400	204360	204360	she	134	" And will that better place be as far away ? "
204401	204412	204414	204414	Peter	144	" Oh Biddy , it would n't be better then , "
204416	204430	204360	204360	she	134	" Do you mean they 'll give you something to do at home ? "
204431	204449	204454	204454	Peter	144	" Hardly that . But I 've a tremendous lot to do at home to - day . "
204500	204534	204535	204536	the girl	481	" The only news is of course the great preparations they 're making , poor dears , for Peter . Mamma thinks you must have had such a nasty dinner the other day , "
204546	204550	204552	204552	Nick	224	" Faithless Peter ! "
204569	204584	204586	204589	the personage so designated	4571	" Dear Biddy , thank your stars you 're not in my horrid profession , "
204591	204619	204586	204589	the personage so designated	4571	" One 's bowled about like a cricket - ball , unable to answer for one 's freedom or one 's comfort from one moment to another . "
204620	204633	204634	204634	Nick	224	" Oh ours is the true profession - Biddy 's and mine , "
204643	204681	204634	204634	Nick	224	" the career of liberty and peace , of charming long mornings spent in a still north light and in the contemplation , I may even say in the company , of the amiable and the beautiful . "
204682	204695	204696	204696	Peter	144	" That certainty 's the case when Biddy comes to see you , "
204704	204719	204699	204699	Biddy	319	" I come every day . Anch'io son pittore ! I encourage Nick awfully . "
204720	204738	204739	204739	Nick	224	" It 's a pity I 'm not a martyr - she 'd bravely perish with me , "
204742	204758	204759	204760	the girl	481	" You are - you 're a martyr - when people say such odious things ! "
204763	204781	204759	204760	the girl	481	" They do say them . I 've heard many more than I 've repeated to you . "
204782	204798	204800	204800	Peter	144	" It 's you yourself then , indignant and loyal , who are the martyr , "
204811	204818	204821	204821	she	481	" Oh I do n't care ! "
204836	204933	204821	204821	she	481	" Do n't you think one can do as much good by painting great works of art as by - as by what papa used to do ? Do n't you think art 's necessary to the happiness , to the greatness of a people ? Do n't you think it 's manly and honourable ? Do you think a passion for it 's a thing to be ashamed of ? Do n't you think the artist - the conscientious , the serious one - is as distinguished a member of society as any one else ? "
204968	204985	204986	204986	Peter	144	" I delight in general in artists , but I delight still more in their defenders , "
204998	205009	205010	205010	Nick	224	" Ah do n't attack me if you 're wise ! "
205013	205025	205010	205010	Nick	224	" One 's tempted to when it makes Biddy so fine . "
205026	205045	205046	205046	Nick	224	" Well , that 's the way she encourages me : it 's meat and drink to me , "
205050	205071	205046	205046	Nick	224	" At the same time I 'm bound to say there 's a little whistling in the dark in it . "
205072	205077	205078	205079	his sister	491	" In the dark ? "
205082	205110	205046	205046	Nick	224	" The obscurity , my dear child , of your own aspirations , your mysterious ambitions and esthetic views . Are n't there some heavyish shadows there ? "
205111	205119	205046	205046	Nick	224	" Why I never cared for politics . "
205120	205145	205046	205046	Nick	224	" No , but you cared for life , you cared for society , and you 've chosen the path of solitude and concentration . "
205146	205151	205153	205153	Biddy	319	" You horrid boy ! "
205155	205173	205174	205174	Peter	144	" Give it up , that arduous steep - give it up and come out with me , "
205177	205183	205046	205046	Nick	224	" Come out with you ? "
205184	205205	205046	205046	Nick	224	" Let us walk a little or even drive a little . Let us at any rate talk a little . "
205206	205216	205217	205217	Biddy	319	" I thought you had so much to do , "
205221	205260	205046	205046	Nick	224	" So I have , but why should n't you do a part of it with me ? Would there be any harm ? I 'm going to some tiresome shops - you 'll cheer the frugal hour . "
205270	205277	205268	205268	Nick	224	" Would there be any harm ? "
205278	205287	205288	205288	Peter	144	" Oh it 's none of his business ! "
205291	205302	205268	205268	Nick	224	" He had better take you home to your mother . "
205303	205318	205319	205319	Biddy	319	" I 'm going home - I sha n't stay here to - day , "
205327	205346	205319	205319	Biddy	319	" I came in a hansom , but I shall walk back . Come that way with me . "
205347	205361	205362	205362	Peter	144	" With pleasure . But I shall not be able to go in , "
205365	205372	205374	205375	the girl	481	" Oh that 's no matter , "
205377	205384	205362	205362	Peter	144	" Good - bye , Nick . "
205385	205410	205411	205411	Peter	144	" You understand then that we dine together - at seven sharp . Would n't a club , as I say , be best ? "
205524	205552	205553	205553	Biddy	319	" Oh that 's perfect ; it will be so good for him - wo n't it ? - if he 's going to paint her again , "
205556	205578	205579	205579	Peter	144	" I think there 's nothing so good for him as that he happens to have such a sister as you , "
205624	205633	205601	205601	Biddy	319	" What a bore - there 's Miriam ! "
205813	205842	205808	205808	Miriam	170	" We know you , we know you ; we saw you in Paris , and you came to my theatre a short time ago with Mr. Sherringham ! "
205843	205861	205863	205864	Mrs. Rooth	178	" We know your mother , Lady Agnes Dormer . I hope her ladyship 's very well , "
205878	205917	205918	205918	Miriam	170	" You offered to do a head of me or something or other : did n't you tell me you work in clay ? I daresay you 've forgotten all about it , but I should be delighted , "
205976	205987	205989	205989	Miriam	170	" I 've sat to your clever brother many times , "
205991	206022	206023	206023	she	170	" I 'm going to sit again . I daresay you 've seen what we 've done - he 's too delightful . Si vous saviez comme cela me repose ! "
206041	206147	206034	206034	she	170	" Only he ought n't to have thrown up such prospects , you know . I 've an idea I was n't nice to you that day in Paris - I was nervous and scared and perverse . I remember perfectly ; I was odious . But I 'm better now - you 'd see if you were to know me . I 'm not a bad sort - really I 'm not . But you must have your own friends . Happy they - you look so charming ! Immensely like Mr. Dormer , especially about the eyes ; is n't she , mamma ? "
206148	206163	206164	206166	the old woman	1320	" She comes of a beautiful Norman race - the finest , purest strain , "
206169	206223	206164	206166	the old woman	1320	" Mr. Dormer 's sometimes so good as to come and see us - we 're always at home on Sunday ; and if some day you found courage to come with him you might perhaps find it pleasant , though very different of course from the circle in which you habitually move . "
206238	206255	206256	206256	she	170	" Different , yes ; but we 're all right , you know . Do come , "
206264	206280	206256	206256	she	170	" Remember what I told you - I do n't expect you to - night . "
206281	206290	206295	206295	he	144	" Oh I understand ; I shall come , "
206299	206317	206318	206318	Miriam	170	" It will be idiotic . Keep him , keep him away - do n't let him , "
206357	206363	206353	206353	he	144	" She 's too fantastic ! "
206364	206383	206384	206385	the girl	481	" Yes , but so tremendously good - looking . I shall ask Nick to take me there , "
206391	206427	206353	206353	he	144	" Well , she 'll do you no harm . They 're all right , as she says . It 's the world of art - you were standing up so for art just now . "
206428	206440	206441	206441	she	481	" Oh I was n't thinking so much of that kind , "
206444	206467	206353	206353	he	144	" There 's only one kind - it 's all the same thing . If one sort 's good the other is . "
206474	206483	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" Is she serious ? Is she conscientious ? "
206484	206494	206495	206495	Peter	144	" She has the makings of a great artist , "
206498	206512	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" I 'm glad to hear you think a woman can be one . "
206513	206526	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" In that line there has never been any doubt about it . "
206527	206534	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" And only in that line ? "
206535	206565	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" I mean on the stage in general , dramatic or lyric . It 's as the actress that the woman produces the most complete and satisfactory artistic results . "
206566	206573	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" And only as the actress ? "
206578	206592	206574	206574	He	144	" Yes , there 's another art in which she 's not bad . "
206593	206600	206602	206602	Biddy	319	" Which one do you mean ? "
206604	206619	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" That of being charming and good , that of being indispensable to man . "
206620	206628	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" Oh that is n't an art . "
206629	206648	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" Then you leave her only the stage . Take it if you like in the widest sense . "
206681	206699	206675	206675	she	319	" Do you mean to say there 's nothing for a woman but to be an actress ? "
206700	206777	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" Never in my life . I only say that that 's the best thing for a woman to be who finds herself irresistibly carried into the practice of the arts ; for there her capacity for them has most application and her incapacity for them least . But at the same time I strongly recommend her not to be an artist if she can possibly help it . It 's a devil of a life . "
206778	206791	206675	206675	she	319	" Oh I know ; men want women not to be anything . "
206792	206815	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" It 's a poor little refuge they try to take from the overwhelming consciousness that you 're in very fact everything . "
206816	206819	206675	206675	she	319	" Everything ? "
206827	206841	206821	206822	the girl	481	" That 's the kind of thing you say to keep us quiet . "
206842	206853	206855	206855	Peter	144	" Dear Biddy , you see how well we succeed ! "
206865	206890	206859	206859	she	481	" Why is it so necessary for you to go to the theatre to - night if Miss Rooth does n't want you to ? "
206891	206911	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" My dear child , she does want me to . But that has nothing to do with it . "
206912	206923	206859	206859	she	481	" Why then did she say that she does n't ? "
206924	206933	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" Oh because she meant just the contrary . "
206934	206946	206859	206859	she	481	" Is she so false then - is she so vulgar ? "
206947	206973	206468	206468	Biddy	319	" She speaks a special language ; practically it is n't false , because it renders her thought and those who know her understand it . "
206974	206988	206989	206989	Biddy	319	" But she does n't use it only to those who know her , "
207036	207036	207022	207022	she	481	"
207045	207053	207037	207037	He	0	" Because you 've my word for it "
207082	207100	207101	207101	He	0	" Dear Biddy , you 're delightfully acute : you 're quite as clever as Miss Rooth . "
207115	207168	207112	207112	he	0	" The truth is that its being important for me to go is a matter quite independent of that young lady 's wishing it or not wishing it . There happens to be a definite intrinsic propriety in it which determines the thing and which it would take me long to explain . "
207169	207189	207190	207191	the girl	481	" I see . But fancy your ' explaining ' to me : you make me feel so indiscreet ! "
207306	207319	207344	207344	He	144	" Hang it , I will keep my engagement to your mother ! "
207375	207390	207364	207365	his companion	647	" Why did she say that Nick ought n't to have resigned his seat ? "
207391	207409	207411	207411	Biddy	319	" Oh I do n't know . It struck her so . It does n't matter much . "
207416	207464	207411	207411	Biddy	319	" If she 's an artist herself why does n't she like people to go in for art , especially when Nick has given his time to painting her so beautifully ? Why does she come there so often if she disapproves of what he has done ? "
207465	207483	207364	207365	his companion	647	" Oh Miriam 's disapproval - it does n't count ; it 's a manner of speaking . "
207484	207509	207411	207411	Biddy	319	" Of speaking untruths , do you mean ? Does she think just the reverse - is that the way she talks about everything ? "
207510	207521	207522	207522	Peter	144	" We always admire most what we can do least , "
207526	207587	207522	207522	Peter	144	" and Miriam of course is n't political . She ranks painters more or less with her own profession , about which already , new as she is to it , she has no illusions . They 're all artists ; it 's the same general sort of thing . She prefers men of the world - men of action . "
207588	207597	207598	207598	Biddy	319	" Is that the reason she likes you ? "
207602	207616	207411	207411	Biddy	319	" Ah she does n't like me - could n't you see it ? "
207628	207641	207625	207625	she	481	" Is that why she lets you call her ' Miriam ' ? "
207642	207652	207411	207411	Biddy	319	" Oh I do n't , to her face . "
207653	207659	207661	207661	Biddy	319	" Ah only to mine ! "
207663	207678	207661	207661	Biddy	319	" One says that as one says ' Rachel ' of her great predecessor . "
207679	207694	207411	207411	Biddy	319	" Except that she is n't so great , quite yet , is she ? "
207695	207733	207734	207734	Peter	144	" Far from it ; she 's the freshest of novices - she has scarcely been four months on the stage . But no novice has ever been such an adept . She 'll go very fast , "
207737	207749	207734	207734	Peter	144	" and I daresay that before long she 'll be magnificent . "
207750	207760	207761	207761	Biddy	319	" What a pity you 'll not see that ! "
207767	207772	207411	207411	Biddy	319	" Not see it ? "
207773	207782	207411	207411	Biddy	319	" If you 're thousands of miles away . "
207783	207789	207790	207790	Peter	144	" It is a pity , "
207793	207873	207790	207790	Peter	144	" and since you mention it I do n't mind frankly telling you - throwing myself on your mercy , as it were - that that 's why I make such a point of a rare occasion like to - night . I 've a weakness for the drama that , as you perhaps know , I 've never concealed , and this impression will probably have to last me in some barren spot for many , many years . "
207874	207889	207891	207892	the girl	481	" I understand - I understand . I hope therefore it will be charming . "
207896	207908	207909	207909	Peter	144	" Just as some other charming impressions will have to last , "
207982	208002	207975	207975	she	481	" Oh I 'm not in the least in a hurry and I really think I had better walk . "
208003	208012	208013	208013	Peter	144	" We 'll walk then by all means ! "
208054	208081	208082	208082	she	319	" After all , though I 'm not in a hurry I 'm tired ! I had better have a cab ; please call that one , "
208133	208135	208087	208087	her	319	" terrace "
208189	208201	208202	208202	she	319	" This is one of the charming things you 'll remember , "
208243	208249	208240	208240	he	144	" Most assuredly it is , "
208261	208279	208255	208255	she	319	" I must go alone ; you 've lots of things to do - it 's all right "
208354	208361	208362	208362	she	319	" Good - bye , Peter , "
208630	208652	208653	208654	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Mercy , how you do abuse your fine profession ! I 'm sure I never urged you to adopt it ! "
208665	208676	208678	208678	Nick	224	" She was abusing mine still more the other day , "
208680	208694	208678	208678	Nick	224	" telling me I ought to be ashamed of it and of myself . "
208695	208716	208718	208720	the old woman	1320	" Oh I never know from one moment to the other - I live with my heart in my mouth , "
208722	208737	208738	208738	Miriam	170	" Are n't you quiet about the great thing - about my personal behaviour ? "
208741	208750	208738	208738	Miriam	170	" My improprieties are all of the mind . "
208751	208763	208764	208765	her mother	460	" I do n't know what you call your personal behaviour , "
208768	208781	208738	208738	Miriam	170	" You would very soon if it were not what it is . "
208782	208802	208803	208804	Mrs. Rooth	178	" And I do n't know why you should wish to have it thought you 've a wicked mind , "
208808	208830	208831	208831	Miriam	170	" Yes , but I do n't see very well how I can make you understand that . At any rate , "
208840	208931	208838	208838	Nick	224	" I retract what I said the other day about Mr. Dormer . I 've no wish to quarrel with him on the way he has determined to dispose of his life , because after all it does suit me very well . It rests me , this little devoted corner ; oh it rests me ! It 's out of the row and the dust , it 's deliciously still and they ca n't get at me . Ah when art 's like this , a la bonne heure ! "
208941	208943	208933	208933	she	170	" art "
208987	209112	208971	208971	she	170	" You 'll always let me come here for an hour , wo n't you , to take breath - to let the whirlwind pass ? You need n't trouble yourself about me ; I do n't mean to impose on you in the least the necessity of painting me , though if that 's a manner of helping you to get on you may be sure it will always be open to you . Do what you like with me in that respect ; only let me sit here on a high stool , keeping well out of your way , and see what you happen to be doing . I 'll tell you my own adventures when you want to hear them . "
209113	209127	209129	209130	Mrs. Rooth	178	" The fewer adventures you have to tell the better , my dear , "
209132	209149	209129	209130	Mrs. Rooth	178	" and if Mr. Dormer keeps you quiet he 'll add ten years to my life . "
209150	209171	209172	209172	Nick	224	" It all makes an interesting comment on Mr. Dormer 's own quietness , on his independence and sweet solitude , "
209175	209211	209172	209172	Nick	224	" Miss Rooth has to work with others , which is after all only what Mr. Dormer has to do when he works with Miss Rooth . What do you make of the inevitable sitter ? "
209212	209215	209217	209217	Miriam	170	" Oh , "
209219	209237	209217	209217	Miriam	170	" you can say to the inevitable sitter , ' Hold your tongue , you brute ! ' "
209238	209260	209261	209262	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Is n't it a good deal in that manner that I 've heard you address your comrades at the theatre ? "
209265	209276	209261	209262	Mrs. Rooth	178	" That 's why my heart 's in my mouth . "
209277	209335	209261	209262	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Yes , but they hit me back ; they reply to me - comme de raison - as I should never think of replying to Mr. Dormer . It 's a great advantage to him that when he 's peremptory with his model it only makes her better , adds to her expression of gloomy grandeur . "
209336	209356	209357	209357	Nick	224	" We did the gloomy grandeur in the other picture : suppose therefore we try something different in this , "
209361	209370	209372	209373	Mrs. Rooth	178	" It is serious , it is grand , "
209389	209413	209372	209373	Mrs. Rooth	178	" It makes one wonder what she 's thinking of . Beautiful , commendable things - that 's what it seems to say . "
209414	209429	209430	209430	Miriam	170	" What can I be thinking of but the tremendous wisdom of my mother ? "
209433	209505	209430	209430	Miriam	170	" I brought her this morning to see that thing - she had only seen it in its earliest stage - and not to presume to advise you about anything else you may be so good as to embark on . She wanted , or professed she wanted , terribly to know what you had finally arrived at . She was too impatient to wait till you should send it home . "
209506	209524	209525	209526	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Ah send it home - send it home ; let us have it always with us ! "
209530	209559	209525	209526	Mrs. Rooth	178	" It will keep us up , up , and up on the heights , near the stars - be always for us a symbol and a reminder ! "
209560	209567	209568	209568	Miriam	170	" You see I was right , "
209572	209798	209568	209568	Miriam	170	" for she appreciates thoroughly , in her own way , and almost understands . But if she worries or distracts you I 'll send her directly home - I 've kept the carriage there on purpose . I must add that I do n't feel quite safe to - day in letting her out of my sight . She 's liable to make dashes at the theatre and play unconscionable tricks there . I shall never again accuse mamma of a want of interest in my profession . Her interest to - day exceeds even my own . She 's all over the place and she has ideas - ah but ideas ! She 's capable of turning up at the theatre at five o'clock this afternoon to demand the repainting of the set in the third act . For myself I 've not a word more to say on the subject - I 've accepted every danger , I 've swallowed my fate . Everything 's no doubt wrong , but nothing can possibly be right . Let us eat and drink , for to - night we die . If you say so mamma shall go and sit in the carriage , and as there 's no means of fastening the doors is there ? your servant shall keep guard over her . "
209799	209929	209568	209568	Miriam	170	" Just as you are now - be so good as to remain so ; sitting just that way - leaning back with a smile in your eyes and one hand on the sofa beside you and supporting you a little . I shall stick a flower into the other hand - let it lie in your lap just as it is . Keep that thing on your head - it 's admirably uncovered : do you call such an unconsidered trifle a bonnet ? - and let your head fall back a little . There it is - it 's found . This time I shall really do something , and it will be as different as you like from that other crazy job . Here we go ! "
209990	210006	210007	210008	Mrs. Rooth	178	" The smile in her eyes - do n't forget the smile in her eyes ! "
210020	210075	210007	210008	Mrs. Rooth	178	" That will make it so different from the other picture and show the two sides of her genius , the wonderful range between them . They 'll be splendid mates , and though I daresay I shall strike you as greedy you must let me hope you 'll send this one home too . "
210445	210447	210442	210442	her	170	" found "
210540	210654	210655	210657	Ah Lady Hamilton	360	" his second performance ; and he added , in the exuberance of having already got a little into relation with his work , that perhaps this did n't matter , inasmuch as - if Miriam would give him his time , to say nothing of her own - a third and a fourth masterpiece might also some day very well struggle into the light . His model rose to this without conditions , assuring him he might count upon her till she grew too old and too ugly and that nothing would make her so happy as that he should paint her as often as Romney had painted the celebrated Lady Hamilton . "
210659	210699	210655	210657	Ah Lady Hamilton	360	" deprecated Mrs. Rooth ; while Miriam , who had on occasion the candour of a fine acquisitiveness , wished to know what particular reason there might be for his not letting them have the picture he was now beginning .
210700	210718	210719	210719	Nick	224	" Why I 've promised it to Peter Sherringham - he has offered me money for it , "
210722	210750	210719	210719	Nick	224	" However , he 's welcome to it for nothing , poor chap , and I shall be delighted to do the best I can for him . "
210772	210784	210751	210752	Mrs. Rooth	178	" He offered you money - just as we came in ? "
210785	210808	210809	210809	Nick	224	" You met him then at the door with my sister ? I supposed you had - he 's taking her home , "
210812	210825	210827	210828	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Your sister 's a lovely girl - such an aristocratic type ! "
210834	210845	210831	210831	she	178	" I 've a tremendous confession to make to you . "
210846	210860	210862	210862	Miriam	170	" Mamma 's confessions have to be tremendous to correspond with her crimes , "
210864	211039	210862	210862	Miriam	170	" She asked Miss Dormer to come and see us , suggested even that you might bring her some Sunday . I do n't like the way mamma does such things - too much humility , too many simagrĂ es , after all ; but I also said what I could to be nice to her . Your sister is charming - awfully pretty and modest . If you were to press me I should tell you frankly that it seems to me rather a social muddle , this rubbing shoulders of ' nice girls ' and filles de thĂ Ă tre : I should n't think it would do your poor young things much good . However , it 's their own affair , and no doubt there 's no more need of their thinking we 're worse than we are than of their thinking we 're better . The people they live with do n't seem to know the difference - I sometimes make my reflexions about the public one works for . "
211040	211058	211059	211059	Nick	224	" Ah if you go in for the public 's knowing differences you 're far too particular , "
211062	211090	211059	211059	Nick	224	" D'ou tombez - vous ? as you affected French people say . If you 've anything at stake on that you had simply better not play . "
211091	211115	211116	211117	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Dear Mr. Dormer , do n't encourage her to be so dreadful ; for it is dreadful , the way she talks , "
211121	211148	211116	211117	Mrs. Rooth	178	" One would think we were n't respectable - one would think I had never known what I 've known and been what I 've been . "
211149	211194	211116	211117	Mrs. Rooth	178	" What one would think , beloved mother , is that you 're a still greater humbug than you are . It 's you , on the contrary , who go down on your knees , who pour forth apologies about our being vagabonds . "
211195	211215	211217	211218	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Vagabonds - listen to her ! - after the education I 've given her and our magnificent prospects ! "
211229	211320	211321	211321	Miriam	170	" Not after our prospects , if prospects they be : a good deal before them . Yes , you 've taught me tongues and I 'm greatly obliged to you - they no doubt give variety as well as incoherency to my conversation ; and that of people in our line is for the most part notoriously monotonous and shoppy . The gift of tongues is in general the sign of your true adventurer . Dear mamma , I 've no low standard - that 's the last thing , "
211325	211495	211321	211321	Miriam	170	" My weakness is my exalted conception of respectability . Ah parlez - moi de Ă a and of the way I understand it ! If I were to go in for being respectable you 'd see something fine . I 'm awfully conservative and I know what respectability is , even when I meet people of society on the accidental middle ground of either glowering or smirking . I know also what it is n't - it is n't the sweet union of well - bred little girls ' carefully - nurtured , ' do n't they call them ? and painted she - mummers . I should carry it much further than any of these people : I should never look at the likes of us ! Every hour I live I see that the wisdom of the ages was in the experience of dear old Madame CarrĂ - was in a hundred things she told me . She 's founded on a rock . After that , "
211503	211538	211496	211496	Miriam	170	" I can assure you that if you were so good as to bring Miss Dormer to see us we should be angelically careful of her and surround her with every attention and precaution . "
211539	211550	211551	211552	Mrs. Rooth	178	" The likes of us - the likes of us ! "
211567	211790	211791	211792	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I do n't know what you 're talking about and I decline to be turned upside down , I 've my ideas as well as you , and I repudiate the charge of false humility . I 've been through too many troubles to be proud , and a pleasant , polite manner was the rule of my life even in the days when , God knows , I had everything . I 've never changed and if with God 's help I had a civil tongue then , I 've a civil tongue now . It 's more than you always have , my poor , perverse , passionate child . Once a lady always a lady - all the footlights in the world , turn them up as high as you will , make no difference there . And I think people know it , people who know anything - if I may use such an expression - and it 's because they know it that I 'm not afraid to address them in a pleasant way . So I must say - and I call Mr. Dormer to witness , for if he could reason with you a bit about it he might render several people a service - your conduct to Mr. Sherringham simply breaks my heart , "
211835	211860	211830	211830	Miriam	170	" Mother 's good - mother 's very good ; but it 's only little by little that you discover how good she is . "
211918	211961	211962	211962	she	170	" Do you mind telling me if you made your sister go off with Mr. Sherringham because you knew it was about time for me to turn up ? Poor Mr. Dormer , I get you into trouble , do n't I ? "
211968	211972	211974	211974	Nick	224	" Into trouble ? "
211986	211996	211997	211997	she	170	" Well , we wo n't talk about that ! "
212082	212085	212076	212076	her	178	" long time "
212150	212186	212188	212188	Miriam	170	" I did it to make the idea of our meeting less absurd - to put it on the footing of our both being artists . I do n't ask you if she has talent , "
212190	212198	212200	212200	Nick	224	" Then I need n't tell you , "
212202	212228	212229	212230	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I 'm sure she has talent and a very refined inspiration . I see something in that corner , covered with a mysterious veil , "
212241	212252	212229	212230	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Has she been trying her hand at Mr. Sherringham ? "
212253	212273	212275	212276	Mrs. Rooth	178	" When should she try her hand , poor dear young lady ? He 's always sitting with us , "
212278	212362	212363	212364	the girl	481	" Dear mamma , you exaggerate . He has his moments - when he seems to say his prayers to me ; but we 've had some success in cutting them down . Il s'est bien dĂ tachĂ ces jours - ci , and I 'm very happy for him . Of course it 's an impertinent allusion for me to make ; but I should be so delighted if I could think of him as a little in love with Miss Dormer , "
212370	212386	212387	212388	her artist	2950	" He is , I think , just a little - just a tiny bit , "
212403	212420	212395	212396	Mrs. Rooth	178	" How can you ask such fantastic questions when you know he 's dying for you ? "
212421	212432	212434	212434	Miriam	170	" Oh dying ! - he 's dying very hard ! "
212436	212491	212434	212434	Miriam	170	" Mr. Sherringham 's a man of whom I ca n't speak with too much esteem and affection and who may be destined to perish by some horrid fever which God forbid ! in the unpleasant country he 's going to . But he wo n't have caught his fever from your humble servant . "
212492	212506	212508	212508	Nick	224	" You may kill him even while you remain in perfect health yourself , "
212510	212542	212508	212508	Nick	224	" and since we 're talking of the matter I do n't see the harm of my confessing that he strikes me as far gone - oh as very bad indeed . "
212543	212560	212434	212434	Miriam	170	" And yet he 's in love with your sister ? - je n'y suis plus . "
212561	212598	212508	212508	Nick	224	" He tries to be , for he sees that as regards you there are difficulties . He 'd like to put his hand on some nice girl who 'd be an antidote to his poison . "
212599	212662	212663	212663	Miriam	170	" Difficulties are a mild name for them ; poison even is a mild name for the ill he suffers from . The principal difficulty is that he does n't know what the devil he wants . The next is that I do n't either - or what the devil I want myself . I only know what I do n't want , "
212677	212932	212663	212663	Miriam	170	" I do n't want a person who takes things even less simply than I do myself . Mr. Sherringham , poor man , must be very uncomfortable , for one side of him 's in a perpetual row with the other side . He 's trying to serve God and Mammon , and I do n't know how God will come off . What I like in you is that you 've definitely let Mammon go - it 's the only decent way . That 's my earnest conviction , and yet they call us people light . Dear Mr. Sherringham has tremendous ambitions - tremendous riguardi , as we used to say in Italy . He wants to enjoy every comfort and to save every appearance , and all without making a scrap of a sacrifice . He expects others - me , for instance - to make all the sacrifices . Merci , much as I esteem him and much as I owe him ! I do n't know how he ever came to stray at all into our bold , bad , downright Bohemia : it was a cruel trick for fortune to play him . He ca n't keep out of it , he 's perpetually making dashes across the border , and yet as soon as he gets here he 's on pins and needles . There 's another in whose position - if I were in it - I would n't look at the likes of us ! "
212933	212943	212944	212944	Nick	224	" I do n't know much about the matter , "
212952	212970	212944	212944	Nick	224	" but I 've an idea Peter thinks he has made or at least is making sacrifices . "
212971	212987	212944	212944	Nick	224	" So much the better - you must encourage him , you must help him . "
212988	213000	212944	212944	Nick	224	" I do n't know what my daughter 's talking about , "
213095	213095	213085	213085	he	211	"
213096	213106	213107	213107	Nick	224	" What danger is there of his staying away ? "
213110	213127	213128	213128	Miriam	170	" If he 's bent on sacrifices that 's a very good one to begin with , "
213131	213154	213155	213156	her mother	460	" That 's the mad , bad way she talks to him - she has forbidden the dear unhappy gentleman the house ! "
213159	213190	213155	213156	her mother	460	" She brought it up to him just now at the door - before Miss Dormer : such very odd form ! She pretends to impose her commands upon him . "
213191	213205	213207	213207	Nick	224	" Oh he 'll be there - we 're going to dine together , "
213225	213245	213221	213221	he	224	" Why we 've arranged it ; I 'm going , and he wo n't let me go alone . "
213246	213257	213258	213259	his sitter	2946	" You 're going ? I sent you no places , "
213262	213284	213258	213259	his sitter	2946	" Yes , but I 've got one . Why did n't you , after all I 've done for you ? "
213291	213301	213302	213302	she	170	" Because I 'm so good . No matter , "
213305	213315	213302	213302	she	170	" if Mr. Sherringham comes I wo n't act . "
213316	213324	213258	213259	his sitter	2946	" Wo n't you act for me ? "
213325	213333	213334	213335	Mrs. Rooth	178	" She 'll act like an angel , "
213338	213361	213334	213335	Mrs. Rooth	178	" She might do , she might be , anything in all the world ; but she wo n't take common pains . "
213362	213371	213373	213373	Miriam	170	" Of one thing there 's no doubt , "
213375	213395	213373	213373	Miriam	170	" that compared with the rest of us - poor passionless creatures - mamma does know what she wants . "
213396	213402	213403	213403	Nick	224	" And what 's that ? "
213409	213414	213403	213403	Nick	224	" She wants everything . "
213415	213426	213428	213430	the old woman	1320	" Never , never - I 'm much more humble , "
213497	213510	213483	213484	the girl	481	" Do you believe for a single moment he 'd marry me ? "
213511	213529	213601	213602	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Why he has proposed to you - you 've told me yourself - a dozen times . "
213530	213536	213537	213537	Miriam	170	" Proposed what to me ? "
213541	213572	213537	213537	Miriam	170	" I 've told you that neither a dozen times nor once , because I 've never understood . He has made wonderful speeches , but has never been serious . "
213573	213600	213601	213602	Mrs. Rooth	178	" You told me he had been in the seventh heaven of devotion , especially that night we went to the foyer of the FranĂ ais , "
213605	213726	213601	213602	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Do you call the seventh heaven of devotion serious ? He 's in love with me , je le veux bien ; he 's so poisoned - Mr. Dormer vividly puts it - as to require a strong antidote ; but he has never spoken to me as if he really expected me to listen to him , and he 's the more of a gentleman from that fact . He knows we have n't a square foot of common ground - that a grasshopper ca n't set up a house with a fish . So he has taken care to say to me only more than he can possibly mean . That makes it stand just for nothing . "
213727	213751	213752	213754	the old woman	1320	" Did he say more than he can possibly mean when he took formal leave of you yesterday - for ever and ever ? "
213765	213781	213759	213759	Nick	224	" And do n't you call that - his taking formal leave - a sacrifice ? "
213782	213799	213601	213602	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Oh he took it all back , his sacrifice , before he left the house . "
213800	213807	213809	213810	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Then has that no meaning ? "
213812	213820	213822	213823	her daughter	499	" None that I can make out , "
213825	213849	213850	213852	the poor lady	5744	" Ah I 've no patience with you : you can be stupid when you will - you can be even that too ! "
213855	213876	213878	213878	Miriam	170	" What mamma wishes me to understand and to practise is the particular way to be artful with Mr. Sherringham , "
213880	213905	213878	213878	Miriam	170	" There are doubtless depths of wisdom and virtue in it . But I see only one art - that of being perfectly honest . "
213906	213923	213924	213924	Nick	224	" I like to hear you talk - it makes you live , brings you out , "
213928	213964	213924	213924	Nick	224	" And you sit beautifully still . All I want to say is please continue to do so : remain exactly as you are - it 's rather important - for the next ten minutes . "
213965	213981	213982	213983	the girl	481	" We 're washing our dirty linen before you , but it 's all right , "
213986	214021	214022	214022	she	481	" because it shows you what sort of people we are , and that 's what you need to know . Do n't make me vague and arranged and fine in this new view , "
214025	214093	214022	214022	she	481	" make me characteristic and real ; make life , with all its horrid facts and truths , stick out of me . I wish you could put mother in too ; make us live there side by side and tell our little story . ' The wonderful actress and her still more wonderful mamma ' - do n't you think that 's an awfully good subject ? "
214170	214187	214188	214189	the girl	481	" She does n't believe Mr. Sherringham wants to marry me any more than you do , "
214204	214289	214188	214189	the girl	481	" but she believes - how indeed can I tell you what she believes ? - that I can work it so well , if you understand , that in the fulness of time I shall hold him in a vice . I 'm to keep him along for the present , but not to listen to him , for if I listen to him I shall lose him . It 's ingenious , it 's complicated ; but I daresay you follow me . "
214290	214299	214301	214301	Nick	224	" Do n't move - do n't move , "
214303	214310	214301	214301	Nick	224	" Pardon a poor clumsy beginner . "
214311	214601	214188	214189	the girl	481	" No , I shall explain quietly . Somehow - here it 's very complicated and you must n't lose the thread - I shall be an actress and make a tremendous lot of money , and somehow too I suppose a little later I shall become an ambassadress and be the favourite of courts . So you see it will all be delightful . Only I shall have to go very straight . Mamma reminds me of a story I once heard about the mother of a young lady who was in receipt of much civility from the pretender to a crown , which indeed he , and the young lady too , afterwards more or less wore . The old countess watched the course of events and gave her daughter the cleverest advice : ' Tiens bon , ma fille , and you shall sit upon a throne . ' Mamma wishes me to tenir bon - she apparently thinks there 's a danger I may n't - so that if I do n't sit upon a throne I shall at least parade at the foot of one . And if before that , for ten years , I pile up the money , they 'll forgive me the way I 've made it . I should hope so , if I 've tenu bon ! Only ten years is a good while to hold out , is n't it ? If it is n't Mr. Sherringham it will be some one else . Mr. Sherringham has the great merit of being a bird in the hand . I 'm to keep him along , I 'm to be still more diplomatic than even he can be . "
214773	214788	214765	214765	she	170	" Ai n't she fascinating ? That 's the way she does for you ! "
214789	214799	214801	214801	Miriam	170	" It 's rather cruel , is n't it , "
214803	214831	214801	214801	Miriam	170	" to deprive people of the luxury of calling one an actress as they 'd call one a liar ? I represent , but I represent truly . "
214832	214850	214852	214853	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Mr. Sherringham would marry you to - morrow - there 's no question of ten years ! "
214872	214890	214860	214860	Miriam	170	" Is n't it droll , the way she ca n't get it out of her head ? "
214900	214915	214860	214860	Miriam	170	" Voyons , look about you : they do n't marry us like that . "
214916	214932	214860	214860	Miriam	170	" But they do - cela se voit tous les jours . Ask Mr. Dormer . "
214933	214952	214860	214860	Miriam	170	" Oh never ! It would be as if I asked him to give us a practical proof . "
214953	214964	214965	214965	Nick	224	" I shall never prove anything by marrying any one , "
214968	214976	214965	214965	Nick	224	" For me that question 's over . "
214984	214994	214977	214977	Miriam	170	" Dear me , how you must hate me ! "
215009	215027	215002	215002	she	170	" People marry them to make them leave the stage ; which proves exactly what I say . "
215028	215037	215039	215040	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Ah they offer them the finest positions , "
215042	215052	215002	215002	she	170	" Do you want me to leave it then ? "
215053	215062	215002	215002	she	170	" Oh you can manage if you will ! "
215063	215087	215002	215002	she	170	" The only managing I know anything about is to do my work . If I manage that decently I shall pull through . "
215088	215102	215002	215002	she	170	" But , dearest , may our work not be of many sorts ? "
215103	215109	215111	215111	Miriam	170	" I only know one , "
215123	215136	215115	215116	her mother	460	" I see you do wish to drive me into the street . "
215137	215172	215173	215174	the girl	481	" Mamma 's bewildered - there are so many paths she wants to follow , there are so many bundles of hay . As I told you , she wishes to gobble them all , "
215181	215212	215178	215178	she	481	" Yes , go and take the carriage ; take a turn round the Park - you always delight in that - and come back for me in an hour . "
215213	215228	215230	215231	Mrs. Rooth	178	" I 'm too vexed with you ; the air will do me good , "
215241	215256	215237	215237	she	178	" I 've your assurance that you 'll bring him then to - night ? "
215257	215272	215273	215273	Nick	224	" Bring Peter ? I do n't think I shall have to drag him , "
215276	215310	215273	215273	Nick	224	" But you must do me the justice to remember that if I should resort to force I should do something that 's not particularly in my interest - I should be magnanimous . "
215311	215322	215324	215325	Mrs. Rooth	178	" We must always be that , must n't we ? "
215327	215335	215336	215336	Miriam	170	" How could it affect your interest ? "
215341	215348	215349	215350	her mother	460	" Yes , as you say , "
215356	215368	215349	215350	her mother	460	" the question of marriage has ceased to exist for you . "
215369	215376	215378	215379	the girl	481	" Mamma goes straight at it ! "
215437	215454	215482	215483	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Why you said a while ago that if Peter was there you would n't act . "
215455	215462	215464	215464	Miriam	170	" I 'll act for him , "
215471	215481	215482	215483	Mrs. Rooth	178	" It does n't matter whom it 's for ! "
215487	215496	215498	215499	the girl	481	" Take your drive and relax your mind , "
215504	215519	215520	215520	She	481	" Come for me in an hour ; not later - but not sooner . "
215546	215554	215555	215555	she	170	" This is the peace I want ! "
216337	216346	216331	216331	he	224	" I 've been looking for her mistakes . "
216369	216384	216361	216361	he	224	" No , I sha n't find them - I sha n't find them . "
216416	216436	216412	216412	Nick	224	" My dear fellow , how can you sit here ? Are n't you going to speak to her ? "
216443	216504	216439	216439	Peter	144	" Lord , no , never again . I bade her good - bye yesterday . She knows what I think of her form . It 's very good , but she carries it a little too far . Besides , she did n't want me to come , and it 's therefore more discreet to keep away from her . "
216505	216515	216516	216516	Nick	224	" Surely it is n't an hour for discretion ! "
216519	216529	216516	216516	Nick	224	" Excuse me at any rate for five minutes . "
216787	216790	216768	216768	she	170	" divinity , "
216976	216981	216967	216967	he	276	" Heuh , heuh ! "
217514	217526	217508	217508	he	144	" It 's a word to say I ca n't come . "
217527	217536	217538	217538	Nick	224	" To Dashwood ? Oh I shall go , "
217540	217550	217551	217552	his companion	647	" Well , I hope you 'll enjoy it ! "
217677	217681	217675	217679	the male " juvenile lead	8048	" juvenile lead , "
217806	217810	217804	217804	Peter	144	" up to , "
217919	217921	217926	217927	his kinsman	802	" rise "
218049	218059	218061	218061	Peter	144	" That 's no use - it 's Italian , "
218063	218135	218061	218061	Peter	144	" only carry it round to Miss Rooth without a minute 's delay . Place it in her hand and she 'll give you some object - a bracelet , a glove , or a flower - to bring me back as a sign that she has received it . I shall be outside ; bring me there what she gives you and you shall have another shilling - only fly ! "
218207	218229	218198	218198	he	144	" I 'm glad I have n't lost you , but why did n't you stay to give her a hand ? "
218230	218240	218182	218183	the audience	5687	" Give her a hand ? I hated it . "
218241	218252	218253	218253	Nick	224	" My dear man , I do n't follow you , "
218256	218275	218253	218253	Nick	224	" If you wo n't come to Dashwood 's supper I fear our ways do n't lie together . "
218276	218293	218182	218183	the audience	5687	" Thank him very much ; say I 've to get up at an unnatural hour . "
218299	218313	218296	218296	Peter	144	" I think I ought to tell you she may not be there . "
218314	218325	218253	218253	Nick	224	" Miss Rooth ? Why it 's all for her . "
218326	218342	218296	218296	Peter	144	" I 'm waiting for a word from her - she may change her mind . "
218348	218358	218343	218343	Nick	224	" For you ? What then have you proposed ? "
218359	218365	218367	218367	Peter	144	" I 've proposed marriage , "
218373	218378	218379	218379	Nick	224	" I say - ! "
218400	218409	218410	218411	the boy	864	" She has given me nothing , sir , "
218414	218427	218410	218411	the boy	864	" but she says I 'm to say ' All right ! ' "
218433	218440	218428	218428	Nick	224	" You 've proposed through him ? "
218441	218452	218460	218460	Peter	144	" Aye , and she accepts . Good - night ! "
218514	218532	218500	218509	the youth in buttons , planted there and wondering too	4798	" Please sir , he told me he 'd give me a shilling and he've forgot it . "
218533	218543	218544	218544	Nick	224	" Oh I ca n't pay you for that ! "
219178	219180	219192	219192	she	170	" dearer "
219282	219295	219267	219267	she	170	" Wait for me , mind ; I shall want you again . "
219296	219307	219308	219308	Peter	144	" What 's the matter - wo n't you stay ? "
219311	219328	219329	219329	he	144	" Are you going out again at this absurd hour ? I wo n't hurt you , "
219351	219361	219343	219343	He	144	" It 's no matter - please drive away . "
219379	219411	219412	219412	she	170	" I 've come because I thought it better to - night , as things have turned out , to do the thing you ask me , whatever it may be , "
219417	219480	219481	219481	she	170	" That 's probably what you calculated I would think , eh ? What this evening has been you 've seen , and I must allow that your hand 's in it . That you know for yourself - that you doubtless felt as you sat there . But I confess I do n't imagine what you want of me here now , "
219498	219500	219497	219497	her	170	" now "
219645	219653	219636	219636	He	144	" I 've simply overrated my strength . "
219654	219672	219673	219673	Miriam	170	" Oh I knew - I knew ! That 's why I entreated you not to come ! "
219716	219727	219728	219728	he	144	" The fact is we must have this thing out , "
219747	219763	219732	219732	he	144	" The failure of my strength - that was just the reason of my coming . "
219852	219900	219839	219839	she	170	" Whatever it is you want - when I understand - you 'll be very brief , wo n't you ? Do you know I 've given up a charming supper for you ? Mamma has gone there . I 've promised to go back to them . "
219901	219922	219923	219923	Peter	144	" You 're an angel not to have let her come with you . I 'm sure she wanted to , "
219927	219939	219941	219942	the girl	481	" Oh she 's all right , but she 's nervous . "
219945	219955	219941	219942	the girl	481	" Could n't she keep you away after all ? "
219956	219963	219964	219965	Biddy Dormer	134	" Whom are you talking about ? "
219979	220006	219964	219965	Biddy Dormer	134	" The charming thing you were with this morning . Is she so afraid of obliging me ? Oh she 'd be so good for you ! "
220007	220014	220015	220015	Peter	144	" Do n't speak of that , "
220019	220057	220015	220015	Peter	144	" I was in perfect good faith yesterday when I took leave of you . I was - I was . But I ca n't - I ca n't : you 're too unutterably dear to me . "
220058	220067	220068	220068	Miriam	170	" Oh do n't - please do n't ! "
220089	220108	220073	220073	She	170	" If it 's only to say that , do n't you know , what 's the use ? "
220109	220135	220068	220068	Miriam	170	" It is n't only to say that . I 've a plan , a perfect plan : the whole thing lies clear before me . "
220136	220144	220073	220073	She	170	" And what 's the whole thing ? "
220152	220169	220145	220145	He	144	" You say your mother 's nervous . Ah if you knew how nervous I am ! "
220170	220180	220068	220068	Miriam	170	" Well , I 'm not . Go on . "
220181	220190	220191	220191	Peter	144	" Give it up - give it up ! "
220194	220199	220200	220200	She	170	" Give it up ? "
220208	220246	220068	220068	Miriam	170	" I 'll marry you to - morrow if you 'll renounce ; and in return for the sacrifice you make for me I 'll do more for you than ever was done for a woman before . "
220247	220261	220262	220262	she	170	" Renounce after to - night ? Do you call that a plan ? "
220265	220285	220262	220262	she	170	" Those are old words and very foolish ones - you wanted something of that sort a year ago . "
220286	220392	220068	220068	Miriam	170	" Oh I fluttered round the idea at that time ; we were talking in the air . I did n't really believe I could make you see it then , and certainly you did n't see it . My own future , moreover , was n't definite to me . I did n't know what I could offer you . But these last months have made a difference - I do know now . Now what I say is deliberate - It 's deeply meditated . I simply ca n't live without you , and I hold that together we may do great things . "
220398	220404	220393	220393	She	170	" What sort of things ? "
220405	220488	220489	220489	Peter	144	" The things of my profession , of my life , the things one does for one 's country , the responsibility and the honour of great affairs ; deeply fascinating when one 's immersed in them , and more exciting really - put them even at that - than the excitements of the theatre . Care for me only a little and you 'll see what they are , they 'll take hold of you . Believe me , believe me , "
220492	220506	220489	220489	Peter	144	" every fibre of my being trembles in what I say to you . "
220507	220516	220517	220517	she	170	" You admitted yesterday it would n't do , "
220521	220531	220517	220517	she	170	" Where were the fibres of your being then ? "
220532	220596	220393	220393	She	170	" They throbbed in me even more than now , and I was trying , like an ass , not to feel them . Where was this evening yesterday - where were the maddening hours I 've just spent ? Ah you 're the perfection of perfections , and as I sat there to - night you taught me what I really want . "
220597	220603	220604	220605	the girl	481	" The perfection of perfections ? "
220612	220647	220648	220648	he	4834	" I need n't try to tell you : you must have felt to - night with such rapture what you are , what you can do . How can I give that up ? "
220653	220722	220724	220724	Miriam	170	" How can I , my poor friend ? I like your plans and your responsibilities and your great affairs , as you call them . Voyons , they 're infantile . I 've just shown that I 'm a perfection of perfections : therefore it 's just the moment to ' renounce , ' as you gracefully say ? Oh I was sure , I was sure ! "
220754	220779	220780	220780	she	170	" I was sure , I mean , that if you did come your poor , dear , doting brain would be quite confused , "
220784	220810	220780	220780	she	170	" I ca n't be a muff in public just for you , pourtant . Dear me , why do you like us so much ? "
220811	220819	220724	220724	Miriam	170	" Like you ? I loathe you ! "
220820	220827	220828	220828	she	170	" Je le vois parbleu bien ! "
220832	220921	220828	220828	she	170	" I mean why do you feel us , judge us , understand us so well ? I please you because you see , because you know ; and then for that very reason of my pleasing you must adapt me to your convenience , you must take me over , as they say . You admire me as an artist and therefore want to put me into a box in which the artist will breathe her last . Ah be reasonable ; you must let her live ! "
220922	220935	220936	220936	Peter	144	" Let her live ? As if I could prevent her living ! "
220942	220984	220985	220985	he	144	" Even if I did wish how could I prevent a spirit like yours from expressing itself ? Do n't talk about my putting you in a box , for , dearest child , I 'm taking you out of one , "
220990	221032	220985	220985	he	144	" The artist is irrepressible , eternal ; she 'll be in everything you are and in everything you do , and you 'll go about with her triumphantly exerting your powers , charming the world , carrying everything before you . "
221056	221062	221052	221052	she	170	" Shall you like that ? "
221063	221084	221052	221052	she	170	" Like my wife to be the most brilliant woman in Europe ? I think I can do with it . "
221085	221093	221052	221052	she	170	" Are n't you afraid of me ? "
221094	221099	221052	221052	she	170	" Not a bit . "
221100	221112	221114	221115	the girl	481	" Bravely said . How little you know me after all ! "
221117	221123	221124	221124	Peter	144	" I tell the truth , "
221129	221225	221226	221228	the young man	445	" and you must do me the justice to admit that I 've taken the time to dig deep into my feelings . I 'm not an infatuated boy ; I 've lived , I 've had experience , I 've observed ; in short I know what I mean and what I want . It is n't a thing to reason about ; it 's simply a need that consumes me . I 've put it on starvation diet , but that 's no use - really , it 's no use , Miriam , "
221240	221297	221226	221228	the young man	445	" It is no question of my trusting you ; it 's simply a question of your trusting me . You 're all right , as I 've heard you say yourself ; you 're frank , spontaneous , generous ; you 're a magnificent creature . Just quietly marry me and I 'll manage you . "
221298	221304	221305	221306	The girl	481	" ' Manage ' me ? "
221318	221390	221305	221306	The girl	481	" I mean I 'll give you a larger life than the largest you can get in any other way . The stage is great , no doubt , but the world 's greater . It 's a bigger theatre than any of those places in the Strand . We 'll go in for realities instead of fables , and you 'll do them far better than you do the fables . "
221412	221425	221426	221426	she	170	" Pardon my saying it after your delightful tributes to my worth , "
221432	221543	221426	221426	she	170	" but I 've never listened to anything quite so grandly unreal . You think so well of me that humility itself ought to keep me silent ; nevertheless I must utter a few shabby words of sense . I 'm a magnificent creature on the stage - well and good ; it 's what I want to be and it 's charming to see such evidence that I succeed . But off the stage , woe betide us both , I should lose all my advantages . The fact 's so patent that it seems to me I 'm very good - natured even to discuss it with you . "
221544	221568	221569	221570	her companion	505	" Are you on the stage now , pray ? Ah Miriam , if it were n't for the respect I owe you ! "
221573	221693	221569	221570	her companion	505	" If it were n't for that I should n't have come here to meet you . My gift is the thing that takes you : could there be a better proof than that it 's to - night 's display of it that has brought you to this unreason ? It 's indeed a misfortune that you 're so sensitive to our poor arts , since they play such tricks with your power to see things as they are . Without my share of them I should be a dull , empty , third - rate woman , and yet that 's the fate you ask me to face and insanely pretend you 're ready to face yourself . "
221694	221701	221702	221702	Sherringham	144	" Without it - without it ? "
221705	221891	221702	221702	Sherringham	144	" Your own sophistry 's infinitely worse than mine . I should like to see you without it for the fiftieth part of a second . What I ask you to give up is the dusty boards of the play - house and the flaring footlights , but not the very essence of your being . Your ' gift , ' your genius , is yourself , and it 's because it 's yourself that I yearn for you . If it had been a thing you could leave behind by the easy dodge of stepping off the stage I would never have looked at you a second time . Do n't talk to me as if I were a simpleton - with your own false simplifications ! You were made to charm and console , to represent beauty and harmony and variety to miserable human beings ; and the daily life of man is the theatre for that - not a vulgar shop with a turnstile that 's open only once in the twenty - four hours . ' Without it , ' verily ! "
221913	221950	221892	221892	Peter	144	" Please let me know the first time you 're without your face , without your voice , your step , your exquisite spirit , the turn of your head and the wonder of your look ! "
222022	222028	222029	222029	she	170	" Surely it 's strange , "
222032	222043	222029	222029	she	170	" the way the other solution never occurs to you . "
222044	222049	221992	221992	she	170	" The other solution ? "
222050	222059	222029	222029	she	170	" That you should stay on the stage . "
222060	222067	222068	222069	her friend	1776	" I do n't understand you , "
222072	222083	222029	222029	she	170	" Stay on my stage . Come off your own . "
222093	222107	222087	222087	he	144	" You mean that if I 'll do that you 'll have me ? "
222108	222141	222068	222069	her friend	1776	" I mean that if it were to occur to you to offer me a little sacrifice on your own side it might place the matter in a slightly more attractive light . "
222142	222153	222154	222154	he	144	" Continue to let you act - as my wife ? "
222157	222174	222154	222154	he	144	" Is it a real condition ? Am I to understand that those are your terms ? "
222175	222190	222068	222069	her friend	1776	" I may say so without fear , because you 'll never accept them . "
222191	222199	222200	222200	he	144	" Would you accept them from me ? "
222203	222237	222200	222200	he	144	" accept the manly , the professional sacrifice , see me throw up my work , my prospects - of course I should have to do that - and simply become your appendage ? "
222247	222266	222238	222238	She	4842	" My dear fellow , you invite me with the best conscience in the world to become yours . "
222267	222296	222068	222069	her friend	1776	" The cases are not equal . You 'd make of me the husband of an actress . I should make of you the wife of an ambassador . "
222297	222320	222322	222322	Miriam	170	" The husband of an actress , c'est bientĂ t dit , in that tone of scorn ! If you 're consistent , "
222329	222340	222322	222322	Miriam	170	" it ought to be a proud position for you . "
222341	222352	222068	222069	her friend	1776	" What do you mean , if I 'm consistent ? "
222353	222432	222322	222322	Miriam	170	" Have n't you always insisted on the beauty and interest of our art and the greatness of our mission ? Have n't you almost come to blows with poor Gabriel Nash about it ? What did all that mean if you wo n't face the first consequences of your theory ? Either it was an enlightened conviction or it was an empty pretence . If you were only talking against time I 'm glad to know it , "
222441	222593	222433	222433	she	170	" The better the cause , it seems to me , the better the deed ; and if the theatre is important to the ' human spirit , ' as you used to say so charmingly , and if into the bargain you 've the pull of being so fond of me , I do n't see why it should be monstrous of you to give us your services in an intelligent , indirect way . Of course if you 're not serious we need n't talk at all ; but if you are , with your conception of what the actor can do , why is it so base to come to the actor 's aid , taking one devotion with another ? If I 'm so fine I 'm worth looking after a bit , and the place where I 'm finest is the place to look after me ! "
222614	222687	222594	222594	He	4843	" You were never finer than at this minute , in the deepest domesticity of private life . I 've no conception whatever of what the actor can do , and no theory whatever about the importance of the theatre . Any infatuation of that sort has completely dropped from me , and for all I care the theatre may go to the dogs - which I judge it altogether probably will ! "
222688	222701	222702	222702	Miriam	170	" You 're dishonest , you 're ungrateful , you 're false ! "
222705	222766	222702	222702	Miriam	170	" It was the theatre brought you here - if it had n't been for the theatre I never would have looked at you . It was in the name of the theatre you first made love to me ; it 's to the theatre you owe every advantage that , so far as I 'm concerned , you possess . "
222767	222776	222778	222778	Peter	144	" I seem to possess a great many ! "
222782	222805	222807	222809	the shining creature	4845	" You might avail yourself better of those you have ! You make me angry , but I want to be fair , "
222811	222856	222807	222809	the shining creature	4845	" and I ca n't be unless you are . You 're not fair , nor candid , nor honourable , when you swallow your words and abjure your faith , when you throw over old friends and old memories for a selfish purpose . "
222857	222874	222875	222875	Peter	144	" ' Selfish purpose ' is , in your own convenient idiom , bientĂ t dit , "
222879	222951	222875	222875	Peter	144	" I suppose you consider that if I truly esteemed you I should be ashamed to deprive the world of the light of your genius . Perhaps my esteem is n't of the right quality - there are different kinds , are n't there ? At any rate I 've explained to you that I propose to deprive the world of nothing at all . You shall be celebrated , allez ! "
222952	222962	222964	222964	she	4846	" Vain words , vain words , my dear ! "
222972	222978	222979	222979	she	4846	" I know of course , "
222983	222997	222979	222979	she	4846	" that to befool yourself with such twaddle you must be pretty bad . "
222998	223006	223007	223007	he	4847	" Yes , I 'm pretty bad , "
223015	223056	223007	223007	he	4847	" What do you do with the declaration you made me the other day - the day I found my cousin here - that you 'd take me if I should come to you as one who had risen high ? "
223062	223123	223057	223057	Miriam	170	" I remember - the chaff about the honours , the orders , the stars and garters . My poor foolish friend , do n't be so painfully literal . Do n't you know a joke when you see it ? It was to worry your cousin , was n't it ? But it did n't in the least succeed . "
223124	223134	223057	223057	Miriam	170	" Why should you wish to worry my cousin ? "
223135	223142	223143	223143	she	170	" Because he 's so provoking ! "
223165	223276	223149	223149	she	170	" Surely , at all events , I had my freedom no less than I have it now . Pray what explanations should I have owed you and in what fear of you should I have gone ? However , that has nothing to do with it . Say I did tell you that we might arrange it on the day you should come to me covered with glory in the shape of little tinkling medals : why should you anticipate that transaction by so many years and knock me down such a long time in advance ? Where 's the glory , please , and where are the medals ? "
223277	223296	223297	223297	he	4848	" Dearest girl , am I not going to strange parts - a capital promotion - next month , "
223301	223353	223297	223297	he	4848	" and ca n't you trust me enough to believe I speak with a real appreciation of the facts that I 'm not lying to you in short when I tell you I 've my foot in the stirrup ? The glory 's dawning . I ' m all right too . "
223354	223386	223149	223149	she	170	" What you propose to me , then , is to accompany you tout bonnement to your new post . What you propose to me is to pack up and start ? "
223387	223395	223397	223397	Peter	144	" You put it in a nutshell . "
223403	223461	223149	223149	she	170	" You 're touching - it has its charm . But you ca n't get anything in any of the Americas , you know . I 'm assured there are no medals to be picked up in those parts - which are therefore ' strange ' indeed . That 's why the diplomatic body hate them all . "
223462	223475	223477	223477	he	144	" They 're on the way , they 're on the way ! "
223483	223613	223614	223614	Peter	144	" The people here do n't keep us long in disagreeable places unless we want to stay . There 's one thing you can get anywhere if you 've ability , and nowhere if you 've not , and in the disagreeable places generally more than in the others ; and that - since it 's the element of the question we 're discussing - is simply success . It 's odious to be put on one 's swagger , but I protest against being treated as if I had nothing to offer - to offer a person who has such glories of her own . I 'm not a little presumptuous ass ; I 'm a man accomplished and determined , and the omens are on my side . "
223627	223647	223614	223614	Peter	144	" Remember , after all , that , strictly speaking , your glories are also still in the future . "
223665	223686	223660	223661	her companion	505	" Ask my official superiors , ask any of my colleagues , if they consider I 've nothing to offer . "
223735	223797	223798	223798	she	170	" It 's perfectly true that my glories are still to come , that I may fizzle out and that my little success of to - day is perhaps a mere flash in the pan . Stranger things have been - something of that sort happens every day . But do n't we talk too much of that part of it ? "
223811	223914	223798	223798	she	170	" Surely it 's vulgar to think only of the noise one 's going to make - especially when one remembers how utterly betes most of the people will be among whom one makes it . It is n't to my possible glories I cling ; it 's simply to my idea , even if it 's destined to betray me and sink me . I like it better than anything else - a thousand times better I 'm sorry to have to put it in such a way than tossing up my head as the fine lady of a little coterie . "
223915	223930	223729	223729	her	170	" A little coterie ? I do n't know what you 're talking about ! "
223940	224044	224045	224045	She	4850	" A big coterie , then ! It 's only that at the best . A nasty , prim , ' official ' woman who 's perched on her little local pedestal and thinks she 's a queen for ever because she 's ridiculous for an hour ! Oh you need n't tell me , I 've seen them abroad - the dreariest females - and could imitate them here . I could do one for you on the spot if I were n't so tired . It 's scarcely worth mentioning perhaps all this while - but I 'm ready to drop . "
224067	224115	224045	224045	She	4850	" They 're waiting for me and I confess I 'm hungry . If I do n't hurry they 'll eat up all the nice things . Do n't say I have n't been obliging , and come back when you 're better . Good - night . "
224116	224136	224137	224137	Peter	144	" I quite agree with you that we 've talked too much about the vulgar side of our question , "
224162	224179	224137	224137	Peter	144	" That 's because I 've wanted to bribe you . Bribery 's almost always vulgar . "
224180	224207	224208	224208	she	4850	" Yes , you should do better . Merci ! There 's a cab : some of them have come for me . I must go , "
224231	224255	224256	224256	he	144	" Believe me , it is n't wise to turn your back on such an affection as mine and on such a confidence , "
224305	224319	224320	224320	he	144	" Such things are the most precious that life has to give us , "
224384	224398	224399	224399	she	4850	" I like your calling the feeling with which I inspire you confidence , "
224420	224445	224399	224399	she	4850	" What is it , then , when I offer you everything I have , everything I am , everything I shall ever be ? "
224470	224486	224464	224464	she	4850	" I 'm sorry for you , yes , but I 'm also rather ashamed . "
224487	224492	224446	224446	She	4850	" Ashamed of me ? "
224493	224648	224649	224649	Miriam	170	" A brave offer to see me through - that 's what I should call confidence . You say to - day that you hate the theatre - and do you know what has made you do it ? The fact that it has too large a place in your mind to let you disown it and throw it over with a good conscience . It has a deep fascination for you , and yet you 're not strong enough to do so enlightened and public a thing as take up with it in my person . You 're ashamed of yourself for that , as all your constant high claims for it are on record ; so you blaspheme against it to try and cover your retreat and your treachery and straighten out your personal situation . But it wo n't do , dear Mr. Sherringham - it wo n't do at all , "
224664	224835	224649	224649	Miriam	170	" you have n't the smallest excuse of stupidity , and your perversity is no excuse whatever . Leave her alone altogether - a poor girl who 's making her way - or else come frankly to help her , to give her the benefit of your wisdom . Do n't lock her up for life under the pretence of doing her good . What does one most good is to see a little honesty . You 're the best judge , the best critic , the best observer , the best believer , that I 've ever come across : you 're committed to it by everything you 've said to me for a twelvemonth , by the whole turn of your mind , by the way you 've followed us up , all of us , from far back . If an art 's noble and beneficent one should n't be afraid to offer it one 's arm . Your cousin is n't : he can make sacrifices . "
224836	224840	224841	224841	Peter	144	" My cousin ? "
224845	224864	224841	224841	Peter	144	" Why , was n't it only the other day you were throwing his sacrifices in his teeth ? "
224878	224886	224887	224887	she	170	" I did that to worry you , "
224890	224906	224649	224649	Miriam	170	" Why should you wish to worry me if you care so little about me ? "
224907	224975	224649	224649	Miriam	170	" Care little about you ? Have n't I told you often , did n't I tell you yesterday , how much I care ? Ai n't I showing it now by spending half the night here with you - giving myself away to all those cynics - taking all this trouble to persuade you to hold up your head and have the courage of your opinions ? "
224976	224985	224987	224987	Peter	144	" You invent my opinions for your convenience , "
224991	225068	224987	224987	Peter	144	" As long ago as the night I introduced you , in Paris , to Mademoiselle Voisin , you accused me of looking down on those who practise your art . I remember how you came down on me because I did n't take your friend Dashwood seriously enough . Perhaps I did n't ; but if already at that time I was so wide of the mark you can scarcely accuse me of treachery now . "
225069	225082	225083	225083	Miriam	170	" I do n't remember , but I daresay you 're right , "
225087	225166	224987	224987	Peter	144	" What I accused you of then was probably simply what I reproach you with now - the germ at least of your deplorable weakness . You consider that we do awfully valuable work , and yet you would n't for the world let people suppose you really take our side . If your position was even at that time so false , so much the worse for you , that 's all . Oh it 's refreshing , "
225196	225240	225179	225179	himself	144	" oh it 's refreshing to see a man burn his ships in a cause that appeals to him , give up something precious for it and break with horrid timidities and snobberies ! It 's the most beautiful sight in the world . "
225269	225340	225366	225366	Miriam	170	" You 're magnificent , you give me at this moment the finest possible illustration of what you mean by burning one 's ships . Verily , verily there 's no one like you : talk of timidity , talk of refreshment ! If I had any talent for it I 'd go on the stage to - morrow , so as to spend my life with you the better . "
225341	225365	225366	225366	Miriam	170	" If you 'll do that I 'll be your wife the day after your first appearance . That would be really respectable , "
225369	225376	225366	225366	Miriam	170	" Unfortunately I 've no talent . "
225377	225387	225366	225366	Miriam	170	" That would only make it the more respectable . "
225388	225396	225397	225397	Peter	144	" You 're just like poor Nick , "
225400	225471	225472	225472	he	144	" you 've taken to imitating Gabriel Nash . Do n't you see that it 's only if it were a question of my going on the stage myself that there would be a certain fitness in your contrasting me invidiously with Nick and in my giving up one career for another ? But simply to stand in the wing and hold your shawl and your smelling - bottle - ! "
225484	225543	225366	225366	Miriam	170	" Holding my shawl and my smelling - bottle is a mere detail , representing a very small part of the whole precious service , the protection and encouragement , for which a woman in my position might be indebted to a man interested in her work and as accomplished and determined as you very justly describe yourself . "
225544	225578	225366	225366	Miriam	170	" And would it be your idea that such a man should live on the money earned by an exhibition of the person of his still more accomplished and still more determined wife ? "
225579	225602	225603	225603	Miriam	170	" Why not if they work together - if there 's something of his spirit and his support in everything she does ? "
225606	225744	225603	225603	Miriam	170	" Je vous attendais with the famous ' person ' ; of course that 's the great stick they beat us with . Yes , we show it for money , those of us who have anything decent to show , and some no doubt who have n't , which is the real scandal . What will you have ? It 's only the envelope of the idea , it 's only our machinery , which ought to be conceded to us ; and in proportion as the idea takes hold of us do we become unconscious of the clumsy body . Poor old ' person ' - if you knew what we think of it ! If you do n't forget it that 's your own affair : it shows you 're dense before the idea . "
225745	225752	225755	225755	Peter	144	" That I ' m dense ? "
225784	225894	225755	225755	Peter	144	" I mean the public is - the public who pays us . After all , they expect us to look at them too , who are not half so well worth it . If you should see some of the creatures who have the face to plant themselves there in the stalls before one for three mortal hours ! I daresay it would be simpler to have no bodies , but we 're all in the same box , and it would be a great injustice to the idea , and we 're all showing ourselves all the while ; only some of us are not worth paying . "
225895	225910	225911	225911	he	144	" You 're extraordinarily droll , but somehow I ca n't laugh at you , "
225929	225949	225950	225950	he	144	" Do you remember the second time I ever saw you - the day you recited at my place ? "
225982	225998	225959	225959	he	144	" Perfectly , and what an idiot I was , though it was only yesterday ! "
225999	226047	225959	225959	he	144	" You expressed to me then a deep detestation of the sort of self - exposure to which the profession you were taking up would commit you . If you compared yourself to a contortionist at a country fair I 'm only taking my cue from you . "
226048	226060	225959	225959	he	144	" I do n't know what I may have said then , "
226075	226206	225959	225959	he	144	" I was no doubt already wonderful for talking of things I know nothing about . I was only on the brink of the stream and I perhaps thought the water colder than it is . One warms it a bit one 's self when once one 's in . Of course I 'm a contortionist and of course there 's a hateful side , but do n't you see how that very fact puts a price on every compensation , on the help of those who are ready to insist on the other side , the grand one , and especially on the sympathy of the person who 's ready to insist most and to keep before us the great thing , the element that makes up for everything ? "
226207	226212	226213	226213	Peter	144	" The element - ? "
226223	226230	226213	226213	Peter	144	" Do you mean your success ? "
226231	226243	226244	226244	she	4862	" I mean what you 've so often been eloquent about , "
226251	226270	226271	226271	she	4862	" the way we simply stir people 's souls . Ah there 's where life can help us , "
226280	226335	226336	226336	She	4862	" there 's where human relations and affections can help us ; love and faith and joy and suffering and experience - I do n't know what to call 'em ! They suggest things , they light them up and sanctify them , as you may say ; they make them appear worth doing . "
226368	226422	226365	226365	she	4862	" I must tell you that in the matter of what we can do for each other I have a tremendously high ideal . I go in for closeness of union , for identity of interest . A true marriage , as they call it , must do one a lot of good ! "
226594	226597	226617	226617	her	4862	" art , "
227096	227100	227112	227112	she	178	" up to . "
227250	227259	227260	227260	she	178	" Do n't let us part so harshly , "
227263	227390	227260	227260	she	178	" with your trying to make me feel as if I were merely disobliging . It 's no use talking - we only hurt each other . Let us hold our tongues like decent people and go about our business . It is n't as if you had n't any cure - when you 've such a capital one . Try it , try it , my dear friend - you 'll see ! I wish you the highest promotion and the quickest - every success and every reward . When you 've got them all , some day , and I 've become a great swell too , we 'll meet on that solid basis and you 'll be glad I 've been dreadful now . "
227391	227406	227407	227407	he	4886	" Surely before I leave you I 've a right to ask you this , "
227430	227450	227421	227421	she	4887	" Are you ready to follow up by a definite promise your implied assurance that I 've a remedy ? "
227451	227456	227457	227457	Miriam	170	" A definite promise ? "
227468	227494	227457	227457	Miriam	170	" I do n't ' imply ' that you 've a remedy . I declare it on the house - tops . That delightful girl - "
227495	227507	227508	227508	he	4886	" I 'm not talking of any delightful girl but you ! "
227532	227560	227508	227508	he	4886	" I simply hold you , under pain of being convicted of the grossest prevarication , to the strict sense of what you said ten minutes ago . "
227561	227587	227588	227588	she	170	" Ah I 've said so many things ! One has to do that to get rid of you . You rather hurt my hand , "
227614	227634	227635	227635	Peter	144	" As I understand you , then , I may have some hope if I do renounce my profession ? "
227638	227738	227635	227635	Peter	144	" If I break with everything , my prospects , my studies , my training , my emoluments , my past and my future , the service of my country and the ambition of my life , and engage to take up instead the business of watching your interests so far as I may learn how and ministering to your triumphs so far as may in me lie - if after further reflexion I decide to go through these preliminaries , have I your word that I may definitely look to you to reward me with your precious hand ? "
227739	227756	227757	227757	she	4890	" I do n't think you 've any right to put the question to me now , "
227794	227844	227845	227845	she	4890	" The case is so very contingent , so dependent on what you ingeniously call your further reflexion . While you really reserve everything you ask me to commit myself . If it 's a question of further reflexion why did you drag me up here ? And then , "
227848	227863	227845	227845	she	4890	" I 'm so far from wishing you to take any such monstrous step . "
227864	227879	227757	227757	she	4890	" Monstrous you call it ? Just now you said it would be sublime . "
227880	227922	227845	227845	she	4890	" Sublime if it 's done with spontaneity , with passion ; ridiculous if it 's done ' after further reflexion . ' As you said , perfectly , a while ago , it is n't a thing to reason about . "
227923	227936	227937	227937	Peter	144	" Ah what a help you 'd be to me in diplomacy ! "
227941	227951	227937	227937	Peter	144	" Will you give me a year to consider ? "
227952	227961	227845	227845	she	4890	" Would you trust me for a year ? "
227962	227976	227937	227937	Peter	144	" Why not , if I 'm ready to trust you for life ? "
227977	228003	227845	227845	she	4890	" Oh I should n't be free then , worse luck . And how much you seem to take for granted one must like you ! "
228004	228007	227937	227937	Peter	144	" Remember , "
228013	228038	227937	227937	Peter	144	" that you 've made a great point of your liking me . Would n't you do so still more if I were heroic ? "
228057	228083	228039	228039	She	4892	" I think I should pity you in such a cause . Give it all to her ; do n't throw away a real happiness ! "
228084	228104	228105	228105	Peter	144	" Ah you ca n't back out of your position with a few vague and even rather impertinent words ! "
228108	228144	228105	228105	Peter	144	" You accuse me of swallowing my opinions , but you swallow your pledges . You 've painted in heavenly colours the sacrifice I 'm talking of , and now you must take the consequences . "
228145	228149	228039	228039	She	4892	" The consequences ? "
228150	228162	228105	228105	Peter	144	" Why my coming back in a year to square you . "
228163	228170	228172	228172	she	4893	" Ah you 're a bore ! "
228180	228201	228202	228202	she	4893	" Come back when you like . I do n't wonder you 've grown desperate , but fancy me then ! "
228214	228224	228225	228225	Peter	144	" Yes , but if he 'll square you ! "
228264	228275	228276	228276	she	178	" What is it he wants to do , dear ? "
228281	228333	228334	228335	the girl	481	" To induce me to marry him if he 'll go upon the stage . He 'll practise over there - where he 's going - and then come back and appear . Is n't it too dreadful ? Talk him out of it , stay with him , soothe him ! "
228339	228383	228334	228335	the girl	481	" You 'll find some drinks and some biscuits in the cupboard - keep him with you , pacify him , give him his little supper . Meanwhile I 'll go to mine ; I 'll take the brougham ; do n't follow ! "
228499	228507	228486	228486	she	178	" I 'm so glad you came . "
228508	228520	228521	228521	Peter	144	" I 'm not . I 've got nothing by it , "
228529	228536	228537	228537	she	178	" Oh it was so beautiful ! "
228540	228572	228521	228521	Peter	144	" The play - yes , wonderful . I 'm afraid it 's too late for me to avail myself of the privilege your daughter offers me . Good - night . "
228573	228586	228588	228589	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Ah it 's a pity ; wo n't you take anything ? "
228591	228606	228588	228589	Mrs. Rooth	178	" When I heard your voice so high I was scared and hung back . "
228615	228624	228612	228612	she	178	" Are you really thinking of the stage ? "
228625	228633	228612	228612	she	178	" It comes to the same thing . "
228634	228642	228612	228612	she	178	" Do you mean you 've proposed ? "
228643	228647	228612	228612	she	178	" Oh unmistakably . "
228648	228655	228612	228612	she	178	" And what does she say ? "
228656	228668	228612	228612	she	178	" Why you heard : she says I 'm an ass . "
228669	228675	228677	228678	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Ah the little wretch ! "
228680	228706	228677	228678	Mrs. Rooth	178	" Leave her to me . I 'll help you . But you are mad . Give up nothing - least of all your advantages . "
228707	228716	228718	228718	Peter	144	" I wo n't give up your daughter , "
228747	228757	228737	228737	He	144	" But you ca n't make her take me . "
228758	228768	228737	228737	He	144	" I can prevent her taking any one else . "
228769	228774	228775	228775	Peter	144	" Oh can you ? "
228783	228792	228793	228793	He	144	" You 'll see - you 'll see . "
228820	228840	228841	228841	she	178	" All you 've got to do is to be yourself - to be true to your fine position , "
228847	228860	228841	228841	she	178	" Trust me with the rest - trust me and be quiet . "
228861	228872	228802	228802	she	178	" How can one be quiet after this magnificent evening ? "
228873	228882	228884	228887	the eager old woman	4905	" Yes , but it 's just that ! "
228889	228924	228884	228887	the eager old woman	4905	" It has launched her so on this sea of dangers that to make up for the loss of the old security do n't you know ? we must take a still firmer hold . "
228925	228931	228932	228932	Peter	144	" Aye , of what ? "
228951	228966	228967	228967	Her	178	" Ah you know : of the real life , of the true anchor ! "
228977	228999	228974	228974	she	178	" I kept it , you see ; but a little extravagance on the night one 's fortune has come ! - "
229019	229026	229014	229014	he	144	" Are you following her again ? "
229027	229034	229036	229036	she	178	" For you - for you ! "
229056	229069	229048	229048	she	178	" Wo n't you come too ? I know he invited you . "
229096	229111	229083	229083	her	178	" I shall keep this up ; I shall never lose sight of her ! "
229338	229340	229319	229319	he	224	" go "
230383	230391	230376	230376	his	224	" What do you say to that ? "
230460	230462	230505	230505	his	147	" had "
230540	230542	230505	230505	his	147	" like "
230613	230615	230602	230603	the disagreeable	4953	" quiet "
231854	231873	231837	231837	She	138	" I should have thought you 'd have gone away somewhere - it must be such a bore . "
232203	232205	232193	232193	her	170	" Fancy "
232212	232234	232193	232193	her	170	" fancy the dear man finding time in the press of all his last duties to ask me to marry him ! "
232235	232254	232255	232255	Nick	224	" He told me you had found time in the press of all yours to say you would , "
233234	233236	233238	233238	she	132	" practically "
233476	233478	233482	233482	her	441	" practically "
233526	233539	233540	233542	the poor lady	5744	" Yes , you make the mess and we pay the penalty ! "
233653	233656	233640	233640	she	140	" nasty . "
234064	234083	234048	234048	he	224	" My poor child , you see after all that we have n't kicked up such a row . "
234292	234326	234284	234284	she	132	" We 're to prepare to spend the autumn at Worthing then or some other horrible place ? I do n't know their names : it 's the only thing we can afford . "
234999	235002	234997	234997	she	5075	" up to "
235348	235350	235354	235354	she	170	" working "
235979	235993	235973	235973	he	276	" Yes , my dear sir , you 've done it this time . "
236019	236027	236012	236012	he	276	" This time she has done it . "
237520	237530	237514	237514	she	170	" So you 're just going to stay on ? "
237553	237573	237541	237541	she	170	" I daresay it 's the best thing for you . You 're just going to grind , eh ? "
237574	237584	237541	237541	she	170	" I see before me an eternity of grinding . "
237585	237606	237541	237541	she	170	" All alone by yourself in this dull little hole ? You will be conscientious , you will be virtuous . "
237607	237622	237541	237541	she	170	" Oh my solitude will be mitigated - I shall have models and people . "
237623	237630	237631	237631	Miriam	170	" What people - what models ? "
237642	237652	237634	237634	she	170	" Well , no one so good as you . "
237653	237659	237660	237661	the girl	481	" That 's a prospect ! "
237664	237676	237660	237661	the girl	481	" for all the good you 've got out of me ! "
237677	237686	237688	237688	Nick	224	" You 're no judge of that quantity , "
237690	237758	237688	237688	Nick	224	" and even I ca n't measure it just yet . Have I been rather a bore and a brute ? I can easily believe it ; I have n't talked to you - I have n't amused you as I might . The truth is that taking people 's likenesses is a very absorbing , inhuman occupation . You ca n't do much to them besides . "
237759	237771	237660	237661	the girl	481	" Yes , it 's a cruel honour to pay them . "
237772	237780	237781	237781	he	224	" Cruel - that 's too much , "
237784	237830	237660	237661	the girl	481	" I mean it 's one you should n't confer on those you like , for when it 's over it 's over : it kills your interest in them . After you 've finished them you do n't like them any more at all . "
237831	237837	237838	237838	Nick	224	" Surely I like you , "
237854	237868	237871	237871	she	5136	" We 've done very well : it 's something not to have quarrelled "
237879	237881	237660	237661	the girl	481	" in "
237884	237915	237916	237916	she	5136	" I would n't have had you slight your work - I would n't have had you do it badly . But there 's no fear of that for you , "
237920	237961	237962	237962	she	5136	" You 're the real thing and the rare bird . I have n't lived with you this way without seeing that : you 're the sincere artist so much more than I. No , no , do n't protest , "
237977	238073	237962	237962	she	5136	" You 'll do things that will hand on your name when my screeching is happily over . Only you do seem to me , I confess , rather high and dry here - I speak from the point of view of your comfort and of my personal interest in you . You strike me as kind of lonely , as the Americans say - rather cut off and isolated in your grandeur . Have n't you any confreres - fellow - artists and people of that sort ? Do n't they come near you ? "
238074	238082	238083	238083	Nick	224	" I do n't know them much , "
238087	238104	238083	238083	Nick	224	" I 've always been afraid of them , and how can they take me seriously ? "
238105	238133	238134	238134	she	5137	" Well , I ' ve got confreres , and sometimes I wish I had n't ! But does your sister never come near you any more , "
238137	238148	238134	238134	she	5137	" or is it only the fear of meeting me ? "
238255	238259	238260	238261	the girl	481	" Oh yes , "
238266	238284	238260	238261	the girl	481	" with Mr. Sherringham 's sister , Mrs. - what 's her name ? I always forget . "
238326	238415	238322	238322	she	481	" That 's the one - the beauty , the wonderful beauty . I shall never forget how handsome she looked the day she found me here . I do n't in the least resemble her , but I should like to have a try at that type some day in a comedy of manners . But who the devil will write me a comedy of manners ? There it is ! The danger would be , no doubt , that I should push her a la charge . "
238536	238545	238547	238547	Nick	224	" I think he 's tired of me , "
238549	238571	238547	238547	Nick	224	" he has n't been near me either . But after all it 's natural - he has seen me through . "
238572	238581	238582	238582	she	481	" Seen you through ? Do you mean , "
238597	238597	238582	238582	she	481	"
238598	238621	238547	238547	Nick	224	" Precisely , and at bottom he does n't like to see me begin . He 's afraid I shall do something . "
238632	238640	238622	238622	She	481	" Do you mean he 's jealous ? "
238641	238913	238582	238582	she	481	" Not in the least , for from the moment one does anything one ceases to compete with him . It leaves him the field more clear . But that 's just the discomfort for him - he feels , as you said just now , kind of lonely : he feels rather abandoned and even , I think , a little betrayed . So far from being jealous he yearns for me and regrets me . The only thing he really takes seriously is to speculate and understand , to talk about the reasons and the essence of things : the people who do that are the highest . The applications , the consequences , the vulgar little effects , belong to a lower plane , for which one must doubtless be tolerant and indulgent , but which is after all an affair of comparative accidents and trifles . Indeed he 'll probably tell me frankly the next time I see him that he ca n't but feel that to come down to small questions of action - to the small prudences and compromises and simplifications of practice - is for the superior person really a fatal descent . One may be inoffensive and even commendable after it , but one can scarcely pretend to be interesting . ' Il en faut comme Ă a , ' but one does n't haunt them . He 'll do his best for me ; he 'll come back again , but he 'll come back sad , and finally he 'll fade away altogether . Hell go off to Granada or somewhere . "
238914	238920	238922	238922	Miriam	170	" The simplifications of practice ? "
238924	238944	238922	238922	Miriam	170	" Why they 're just precisely the most blessed things on earth . What should we do without them ? "
238945	238949	238950	238950	Nick	224	" What indeed ? "
238953	238973	238950	238950	Nick	224	" But if we need them it 's because we 're not superior persons . We 're awful Philistines . "
238974	238982	238983	238984	the girl	481	" I 'll be one with you , "
238987	239023	238983	238984	the girl	481	" Poor Nash is n't worth talking about . What was it but a small question of action when he preached to you , as I know he did , to give up your seat ? "
239024	239067	238950	238950	Nick	224	" Yes , he has a weakness for giving up - he 'll go with you as far as that . But I 'm not giving up any more , you see . I 'm pegging away , and that 's gross . "
239068	239078	239079	239079	she	481	" He 's an idiot - n'en parlons plus ! "
239089	239096	239097	239097	Nick	224	" Ah I stick to him , "
239100	239109	239097	239097	Nick	224	" He helped me at a difficult time . "
239110	239120	238950	238950	Nick	224	" You ought to be ashamed to confess it . "
239121	239128	239129	239129	Nick	224	" Oh you are a Philistine ! "
239132	239137	239138	239138	she	481	" Certainly I am , "
239146	239457	239138	239138	she	481	" if it makes me one to be sorry , awfully sorry and even rather angry , that I have n't before me a period of the same sort of unsociable pegging away that you have . For want of it I shall never really be good . However , if you do n't tell people I 've said so they 'll never know . Your conditions are far better than mine and far more respectable : you can do as many things as you like in patient obscurity while I 'm pitchforked into the melĂ e and into the most improbable fame - all on the back of a solitary cheval de bataille , a poor broken - winded screw . I read it clear that I shall be condemned for the greater part of the rest of my days - do you see that ? - to play the stuff I 'm acting now . I 'm studying Juliet and I want awfully to do her , but really I 'm mortally afraid lest , making a success of her , I should find myself in such a box . Perhaps the brutes would want Juliet for ever instead of my present part . You see amid what delightful alternatives one moves . What I long for most I never shall have had - five quiet years of hard all - round work in a perfect company , with a manager more perfect still , playing five hundred things and never being heard of at all . I may be too particular , but that 's what I should have liked . I think I 'm disgusting with my successful crudities . It 's discouraging ; it makes one not care much what happens . What 's the use , in such an age , of being good ? "
239458	239465	239466	239466	Nick	224	" Good ? Your haughty claim , "

239477	239495	239497	239497	Miriam	170	" I mean good , you know - there are other ways . Do n't be stupid . "
239513	239523	239524	239524	he	224	" I scarcely know what to say to you , "
239528	239542	239524	239524	he	224	" for certainly it 's your fault if you get on so fast . "
239543	239554	239587	239587	she	170	" I 'm too clever - I 'm a humbug . "
239555	239565	239567	239567	Nick	224	" That 's the way I used to be , "
239614	239682	239587	239587	she	170	" Ah , the pride of that - the sense of purification ! He ' used ' to be forsooth ! Poor me ! Of course you 'll say , ' Look at the sort of thing I 've undertaken to produce compared with the rot you have . ' So it 's all right . Become great in the proper way and do n't expose me . "
239718	239726	239727	239727	she	170	" Poor Mr. Sherringham - with that ! "
239730	239743	239744	239744	Nick	224	" Oh I 'll finish it - it will be very decent , "
239747	239753	239714	239714	her	170	" Finish it by yourself ? "
239754	239770	239714	239714	her	170	" Not necessarily . You 'll come back and sit when you return to London . "
239771	239779	239714	239714	her	170	" Never , never , never again . "
239783	239796	239780	239780	He	224	" Why you 've made me the most profuse offers and promises . "
239797	239856	239868	239868	she	170	" Yes , but they were made in ignorance and I 've backed out of them . I 'm capricious too - faites la part de Ă a . I see it would n't do - I did n't know it then . We 're too far apart - I am , as you say , a Philistine . "
239871	239882	239868	239868	she	170	" You 'll find other models . Paint Gabriel Nash . "
239883	239893	239868	239868	she	170	" Gabriel Nash - as a substitute for you ? "
239894	239912	239913	239913	Miriam	170	" It will be a good way to get rid of him . Paint Mrs. Dallow too , "
239929	239945	239917	239917	she	170	" paint Mrs. Dallow if you wish to eradicate the last possibility of a throb . "
240001	240015	240143	240143	She	170	" The last possibility ? Do you mean in her or in me ? "
240016	240031	240143	240143	She	170	" Oh in you . I do n't know anything about ' her . ' "
240032	240041	240042	240042	he	224	" But that would n't be the effect , "
240050	240068	240042	240042	he	224	" I believe that if she were to sit to me the usual law would be reversed . "
240069	240074	240143	240143	She	170	" The usual law ? "
240075	240098	240099	240099	he	224	" Which you cited a while since and of which I recognised the general truth . In the case you speak of , "
240102	240111	240099	240099	he	224	" I should probably make a shocking picture . "
240112	240130	240131	240131	Miriam	170	" And fall in love with her again ? Then for God 's sake risk the daub ! "

241374	241383	241371	241371	he	224	" Do you mean my pictures are nice ? "
241384	241396	241679	241679	Nash	147	" Yes , yes , your pictures and the whole thing . "
241397	241402	241371	241371	he	224	" The whole thing ? "
241403	241447	241679	241679	Nash	147	" Your existence in this little , remote , independent corner of the great city . The disinterestedness of your attitude , the persistence of your effort , the piety , the beauty , in short the edification , of the whole spectacle . "
241454	241474	241448	241448	Nick	224	" How near to having had enough of me you must be when you speak of me as edifying ! "
241501	241669	241493	241493	he	147	" Vous allez me lĂ cher , I see it coming ; and who can blame you ? - for I 've ceased to be in the least spectacular . I had my little hour ; it was a great deal , for some people do n't even have that . I 've given you your curious case and I 've been generous ; I made the drama last for you as long as I could . You 'll ' slope , ' my dear fellow - you 'll quietly slope ; and it will be all right and inevitable , though I shall miss you greatly at first . Who knows whether without you I should n't still have been ' representing ' Harsh , heaven help me ? You rescued me ; you converted me from a representative into an example - that 's a shade better . But do n't I know where you must be when you 're reduced to praising my piety ? "
241670	241677	241679	241679	Nash	147	" Do n't turn me away , "
241682	241688	241679	241679	Nash	147	" give me a cigarette . "
241689	241741	241493	241493	he	147	" I shall never dream of turning you away ; I shall cherish you till the latest possible hour . I 'm only trying to keep myself in tune with the logic of things . The proof of how I cling is that precisely I want you to sit to me . "
241742	241748	241679	241679	Nash	147	" To sit to you ? "
241760	242004	242005	242005	Nick	224	" Certainly , for after all it is n't much to ask . Here we are and the hour 's peculiarly propitious - long light days with no one coming near me , so that I 've plenty of time . I had a hope I should have some orders : my younger sister , whom you know and who 's a great optimist , plied me with that vision . In fact we invented together a charming little sordid theory that there might be rather a ' run ' on me from the chatter such as it was produced by my taking up this line . My sister struck out the idea that a good many of the pretty ladies would think me interesting and would want to be done . Perhaps they do , but they 've controlled themselves , for I ca n't say the run has commenced . They have n't even come to look , but I daresay they do n't yet quite take it in . Of course it 's a bad time - with every one out of town ; though you know they might send for me to come and do them at home . Perhaps they will when they settle down . A portrait - tour of a dozen country - houses for the autumn and winter - what do you say to that for the ardent life ? I know I excruciate you , "
242008	242029	242005	242005	Nick	224	" but do n't you see how it 's in my interest to try how much you 'll still stand ? "
242050	242064	242065	242065	he	147	" Mrs. Dallow will send for you - vous allez voir Ă a , "
242076	242083	242030	242030	Gabriel	147	" She 'll send for me ? "
242084	242424	242425	242425	Nash	147	" To paint her portrait ; she 'll recapture you on that basis . She 'll get you down to one of the country - houses , and it will all go off as charmingly - with sketching in the morning , on days you ca n't hunt , and anything you like in the afternoon , and fifteen courses in the evening ; there 'll be bishops and ambassadors staying - as if you were a ' well - known , ' awfully clever amateur . Take care , take care , for , fickle as you may think me , I can read the future : do n't imagine you 've come to the end of me yet . Mrs. Dallow and your sister , of both of whom I speak with the greatest respect , are capable of hatching together the most conscientious , delightful plan for you . Your differences with the beautiful lady will be patched up and you 'll each come round a little and meet the other halfway . The beautiful lady will swallow your profession if you 'll swallow hers . She 'll put up with the palette if you 'll put up with the country - house . It will be a very unusual one in which you wo n't find a good north room where you can paint . You 'll go about with her and do all her friends , all the bishops and ambassadors , and you 'll eat your cake and have it , and every one , beginning with your wife , will forget there 's anything queer about you , and everything will be for the best in the best of worlds ; so that , together - you and she - you 'll become a great social institution and every one will think she has a delightful husband ; to say nothing of course of your having a delightful wife . Ah my dear fellow , you turn pale , and with reason ! "
242430	242458	242425	242425	Nash	147	" that 's to pay you for having tried to make me let you have it . You have it then there ! I may be a bore "
242484	242647	242648	242648	Nash	147	" I may be a bore , but once in a while I strike a light , I make things out . Then I venture to repeat , ' Take care , take care . ' If , as I say , I respect ces dames infinitely it 's because they will be acting according to the highest wisdom of their sex . That 's the sort of thing women do for a man - the sort of thing they invent when they 're exceptionally good and clever . When they 're not they do n't do so well ; but it 's not for want of trying . There 's only one thing in the world better than their incomparable charm : it 's their abysmal conscience . Deep calleth unto deep - the one 's indeed a part of the other . And when they club together , when they earnestly consider , as in the case we 're supposing , "
242651	242679	242648	242648	Nash	147	" then the whole thing takes a lift ; for it 's no longer the virtue of the individual , it 's that of the wondrous sex . "
242680	242696	242697	242697	Nick	224	" You 're so remarkable that , more than ever , I must paint you , "
242700	242837	242697	242697	Nick	224	" though I 'm so agitated by your prophetic words that my hand trembles and I shall doubtless scarcely be able to hold my brush . Look how I rattle my easel trying to put it into position . I see it all there just as you show it . Yes , it will be a droll day , and more modern than anything yet , when the conscience of women makes out good reasons for men 's not being in love with them . You talk of their goodness and cleverness , and it 's certainly much to the point . I do n't know what else they themselves might do with those graces , but I do n't see what man can do with them but be fond of them where he finds them . "
242838	242850	242852	242852	Nash	147	" Oh you 'll do it - you 'll do it ! "
242857	242865	242648	242648	Nash	147	" What is it I shall do ? "
242866	242932	242648	242648	Nash	147	" Exactly what I just said ; if not next year then the year after , or the year after that . You 'll go halfway to meet her and she 'll drag you about and pass you off . You 'll paint the bishops and become a social institution . That is , you 'll do it if you do n't take great care . "
242933	242956	242957	242957	Nick	224	" I shall , no doubt , and that 's why I cling to you . You must still look after me , "
242961	243228	242957	242957	Nick	224	" Do n't melt away into a mere improbable reminiscence , a delightful , symbolic fable - do n't if you can possibly help it . The trouble is , you see , that you ca n't really keep hold very tight , because at bottom it will amuse you much more to see me in another pickle than to find me simply jogging down the vista of the years on the straight course . Let me at any rate have some sort of sketch of you as a kind of feather from the angel 's wing or a photograph of the ghost - to prove to me in the future that you were once a solid sociable fact , that I did n't invent you , did n't launch you as a deadly hoax . Of course I shall be able to say to myself that you ca n't have been a fable - otherwise you 'd have a moral ; but that wo n't be enough , because I 'm not sure you wo n't have had one . Some day you 'll peep in here languidly and find me in such an attitude of piety - presenting my bent back to you as I niggle over some interminable botch - that I shall give cruelly on your nerves and you 'll just draw away , closing the door softly . You 'll be gentle and considerate about it and spare me , you wo n't even make me look round . You 'll steal off on tiptoe , never , never to return . "
243829	243845	243794	243794	he	224	" But , my dear fellow , what will you do when you 're old ? "
243846	243855	243856	243856	Nash	147	" Old ? What do you call old ? "
243870	243968	243856	243856	Nash	147	" Must I really remind you at this time of day that that term has no application to such a condition as mine ? It only belongs to you wretched people who have the incurable superstition of ' doing ' ; it 's the ignoble collapse you prepare for yourselves when you cease to be able to do . For me there 'll be no collapse , no transition , no clumsy readjustment of attitude ; for I shall only be , more and more , with all the accumulations of experience , the longer I live . "
243969	243979	243981	243981	Nick	224	" Oh I 'm not particular about the term , "
243983	244014	243981	243981	Nick	224	" If you do n't call it old , the ultimate state , call it weary - call it final . The accumulations of experience are practically accumulations of fatigue . "
244015	244034	243856	243856	Nash	147	" I do n't know anything about weariness . I live freshly - it does n't fatigue me . "
244035	244042	244043	244043	Nick	224	" Then you need never die , "
244046	244057	243856	243856	Nash	147	" Certainly ; I daresay I 'm indestructible , immortal . "
244149	244154	244100	244100	his	147	" without a trace , "
244680	244684	244685	244685	she	134	" Oh nothing , "
244739	244752	244735	244735	her	134	" Oh I daresay that before long she 'll write to her . "
244753	244760	244724	244724	he	151	" Who 'll write to whom ? "
244761	244805	244735	244735	her	134	" Mamma'll write to Percy 's wife . I 'm sure he 'd like it . Of course we shall end by going to see her . He was awfully disappointed at what he found in Spain - he did n't find anything . "
245205	245207	245215	245215	she	138	" all "
245413	245566	245410	245410	Nick	224	" the whole company : they followed him about , they waylaid him on staircases , clamouring to be allowed to sit . He obliged them so far as he could , all save Julia , who did n't clamour ; and , growing rather red , he thought of Gabriel Nash while he bent over the paper . Early in the new year he went abroad for six weeks , but only as far as Paris . It was a new Paris for him then ; a Paris of the Rue Bonaparte and three or four professional friends - he had more of these there than in London ; a Paris of studios and studies and models , of researches and revelations , comparisons and contrasts , of strong impressions and long discussions and rather uncomfortable economies , small cafĂ s , bad fires and the general sense of being twenty again .

246140	246159	246189	246189	She	134	" Six months ago ? What 's the matter with it and why do n't you go on ? "
246160	246188	246126	246126	Nick	224	" What 's the matter with it is more than I can tell you . But I ca n't go on because I 've lost my model . "
246196	246202	246189	246189	She	134	" Is he beautifully dead ? "
246223	246236	246203	246204	Her brother	458	" He 's only dead to me . He has gone away . "
246237	246243	246189	246189	She	134	" Where has he gone ? "
246244	246252	246203	246204	Her brother	458	" I have n't the least idea . "
246253	246260	246262	246262	Biddy	134	" Why , have you quarrelled ? "
246266	246284	246203	246204	Her brother	458	" Quarrelled ? For what do you take us ? Docs the nightingale quarrel with the moon ? "
246285	246297	246298	246298	she	134	" I need n't ask which of you is the moon , "
246301	246314	246315	246315	Nick	224	" Of course I 'm the nightingale . But , more literally , "
246318	246338	246315	246315	Nick	224	" Nash has melted back into the elements - he 's part of the great air of the world . "

246404	246420	246389	246389	she	134	" If she dislikes him why should she be glad he 's so enviably placed ? "
246421	246436	246389	246389	she	134	" I mean about his going away . She 'll be glad of that . "

246447	246456	246444	246444	Nick	224	" what has Julia to do with it ? "
246457	246469	246470	246470	Biddy	134	" She has more to do with things than you think , "
246510	246523	246507	246507	she	134	" She thinks he has been a bad element in your life . "
246531	246561	246524	246524	Nick	224	" She thinks perhaps , but she does n't think enough ; otherwise she 'd arrive at this better thought - that she knows nothing whatever about my life . "

246574	246603	246567	246568	the girl	481	" you do n't imagine what an interest she takes in it . She has told me many times - she has talked lots to me about it . "
246633	246648	246617	246617	her	134	" She has a conviction it was Mr. Nash who made trouble between you . "

246659	246727	246728	246730	our young man	528	" those are thoroughly second - rate ideas , the result of a perfectly superficial view . Excuse my possibly priggish tone , but they really attribute to my dear detached friend a part he 's quite incapable of playing . He can neither make trouble nor take trouble ; no trouble could ever either have come out of him or have got into him . Moreover , "
246733	246789	246728	246730	our young man	528	" if Julia has talked to you so much about the matter there 's no harm in my talking to you a little . When she threw me over in an hour it was on a perfectly definite occasion . That occasion was the presence in my studio of a dishevelled , an abandoned actress . "
246790	246801	246802	246802	Biddy	134	" Oh Nick , she has not thrown you over ! "
246805	246814	246802	246802	Biddy	134	" She has not - I 've proof . "

247157	247185	247145	247145	He	224	" It 's all right if she knows I am . But why does n't she come like any one else ? I do n't refuse people ! "

247593	247649	247590	247590	Nick	224	" My dear child , it would take a cleverer head than you or me , or even Julia , who must have invented that wise theory , to say what they were . However , let us agree that even if they were perfectly fiendish my good sense has been a match for them . "
247650	247658	247660	247660	Biddy	134	" Oh Nick , that 's delightful ! "
247666	247677	247663	247663	she	134	" Do you mean she does n't come any more ? "
247678	247692	247663	247663	she	134	" The dishevelled actress ? She has n't been near me for months . "
247693	247716	247717	247717	Biddy	134	" But she 's in London - she 's always acting ? I 've been away so much I 've scarcely observed , "
247726	247774	247781	247781	she	134	" The same silly part , poor creature , for nearly a year . It appears that that 's ' success ' - in her profession . I saw her in the character several times last summer , but have n't set foot in her theatre since . "
247784	247792	247781	247781	she	134	" Peter would n't have liked that . "
247793	247800	247801	247801	Nick	224	" Oh Peter 's likes - ! "
247813	247825	247781	247781	she	134	" I mean her acting the same part for a year . "
247826	247843	247781	247781	she	134	" I 'm sure I do n't know ; he has never written me a word . "
247844	247849	247850	247850	Biddy	134	" Nor me either , "
247874	247919	247870	247870	his	224	" There 's one thing certainly Peter would like - that is simply to be here to - night . It 's a great night - another great night - for the abandoned one . She 's to act Juliet for the first time . "
247920	247930	247931	247932	the girl	481	" Ah how I should like to see her ! "
247945	247970	247940	247940	she	481	" She has sent me a stall ; I wish she had sent me two . I should have been delighted to take you . "
247971	247981	247982	247982	Biddy	134	" Do n't you think you could get another ? "
247985	247999	248000	248000	Nick	224	" They must be in tremendous demand . But who knows after all ? "
248010	248023	248000	248000	Nick	224	" Here 's a chance - here 's quite an extraordinary chance ! "
248046	248050	248051	248052	the man	5488	" Miss Rooth ! "
248078	248088	248061	248076	a gentleman who came next and who exclaimed , laughing and with a gesture gracefully corrective	5292	" No , no - no longer Miss Rooth ! "
248168	248172	248173	248173	she	170	" Good - morning "
248366	248375	248376	248376	Miriam	170	" You never came - you never came , "
248424	248440	248442	248443	Miss Rooth	170	" Very true - he has n't come himself . What 's he doing now ? "
248600	248605	248606	248607	The actress	1158	" hold her ground . "
248685	248699	248700	248700	Miriam	170	" We 're in a great excitement - he has taken a theatre , "
248703	248708	248709	248709	Biddy	134	" Taken a theatre ? "
248713	248754	248755	248755	Miriam	170	" We 're going to set up for ourselves . He 's going to do for me altogether . It has all been arranged only within a day or two . It remains to be seen how it will answer , "
248771	248810	248758	248758	Biddy	134	" Do you know why I 've broken in here to - day after a long absence - interrupting your poor brother so basely , taking up his precious time ? It 's because I 'm so nervous . "
248811	248817	248818	248818	Biddy	134	" About your first night ? "
248821	248832	248833	248833	Miriam	170	" Do you know about that - are you coming ? "
248839	248853	248818	248818	Biddy	134	" No , I 'm not coming - I have n't a place . "
248854	248864	248758	248758	Biddy	134	" Will you come if I send you one ? "
248865	248876	248878	248879	the girl	481	" Oh but really it 's too beautiful of you ! "
248881	248931	248932	248932	She	481	" You shall have a box ; your brother shall bring you . They ca n't squeeze in a pin , I 'm told ; but I 've kept a box , I 'll manage it . Only if I do , you know , mind you positively come ! "
248948	248969	248942	248942	her	481	" Do n't be afraid . And may I bring a friend - the friend with whom I 'm staying ? "
248975	248982	248970	248970	Miriam	170	" Do you mean Mrs. Dallow ? "
248983	249009	249011	249011	Biddy	134	" No , no - Miss Tressilian . She puts me up , she has got a flat . Did you ever see a flat ? "
249014	249022	249023	249023	Miriam	170	" My cousin 's not in London . "
249040	249063	249033	249033	Biddy	134	" Fancy what kindness , Nick : we 're to have a box to - night and you 're to take me ! "
249135	249146	249147	249147	Miriam	170	" You have n't kept one as I told you ? "
249150	249171	249243	249244	the girl	481	" As you told me , my dear ? Tell the lamb to keep its tenderest mutton from the wolves ! "
249172	249183	249184	249184	Miriam	170	" You shall have one : we 'll arrange it , "
249190	249202	249204	249205	Basil Dashwood	276	" Let me qualify that statement a little , Miss Dormer , "
249207	249218	249204	249205	Basil Dashwood	276	" We 'll arrange it if it 's humanly possible . "
249219	249239	249240	249240	Miriam	170	" We 'll arrange it even if it 's inhumanly i m possible - that 's just the point , "
249246	249270	249271	249271	she	170	" Do n't talk about trouble - what 's he meant for but to take it ? Cela s'annonce bien , you see , "
249276	249289	249271	249271	she	170	" does n't it look as if we should pull beautifully together ? "
249322	249342	249311	249311	she	170	" What will you have ? It seemed simpler ! It was clear there had to be some one . "
249777	249780	249818	249818	Miriam	170	" revelation , "
249781	249784	249818	249818	Miriam	170	" incarnation , "
249785	249788	249818	249818	Miriam	170	" acclamation , "
249789	249792	249818	249818	Miriam	170	" demonstration , "
249793	249795	249818	249818	Miriam	170	" ovation "
249809	249811	249818	249818	Miriam	170	" extraordinary "
249927	249936	249920	249921	Miss Tressilian	317	" Only fancy - there 's Mr. Sherringham ! "
250111	250120	250098	250098	Biddy	134	" He has come home to marry Juliet ! "
250129	250149	250121	250121	Nick	224	" What a disaster - to make such a journey as that and to be late for the fair ! "
250150	250156	250098	250098	Biddy	134	" Late for the fair ? "
250157	250245	250246	250246	Nick	224	" Why she 's married - these three days . They did it very quietly ; Miriam says because her mother hated it and hopes it wo n't be much known ! All the same she 's Basil Dashwood 's wedded wife - he has come in just in time to take the receipts for Juliet . It 's a good thing , no doubt , for there are at least two fortunes to be made out of her , and he 'll give up the stage . "
250335	250341	250323	250323	she	134	" Poor , poor Peter ! "
250354	250378	250379	250379	He	224	" He ought to come round and speak to us , but if he does n't see us I suppose he does n't . "
250442	250457	250437	250438	Miss Tressilian	317	" Look at him , dearest ; he 's turning his head this way ! "
250458	250471	250473	250473	Biddy	134	" Thank you , I do n't care to watch his turns , "
250677	250772	250674	250674	Nick	224	" It 's quite true he has just arrived ; he 's in Great Stanhope Street . They 've given him several weeks , to make up for the uncomfortable way they bundled him off - to get there in time for some special business that had suddenly to be gone into - when he first went out : he tells me they even then promised that . He got into Southampton only a few hours ago , rushed up by the first train he could catch and came off here without any dinner . "
250773	250776	250778	250779	Miss Tressilian	317	" Fancy ! "
250871	250898	250862	250862	he	224	" Oh he 'll turn up ; we had a goodish talk in the lobby where he met me . I think he went out somewhere . "
250899	250916	250917	250917	Biddy	134	" How odd to come so many thousand miles for this and then not to stay ! "
250920	250929	250930	250931	Miss Tressilian	317	" Did he come on purpose for this ? "
250934	250945	250947	250947	Biddy	134	" Perhaps he 's gone out to get his dinner ! "
251122	251132	251120	251120	Biddy	134	" Poor Peter ! Where is he , then ? "
251138	251145	251133	251133	Nick	224	" He 's walking the streets . "
251146	251151	251170	251170	his	528	" Walking the streets ? "
251152	251163	251170	251170	his	528	" I do n't know - I give it up ! "
251190	251211	251187	251187	Biddy	134	" Was it for him this morning she wanted that place - when she asked you to give yours back ? "
251212	251521	251170	251170	his	528	" For him exactly . It 's very odd she had just managed to keep it - for all the good use he makes of it ! She told me just now that she heard from him , at his post , a short time ago , to the effect that he had seen in a newspaper a statement she was going to do Juliet and that he firmly intended , though the ways and means were not clear to him - his leave of absence had n't yet come out and he could n't be sure when it would come - to be present on her first night ; whereby she must do him the service to provide him a place . She thought this a speech rather in the air , so that in the midst of all her cares she took no particular pains about the matter . She had an idea she had really done with him for a long time . But this afternoon what does he do but telegraph to her from Southampton that he keeps his appointment and counts on her for a stall ? Unless she had got back mine she would n't have been able to help him . When she was in Rosedale Road this morning she had n't received his telegram ; but his promise , his threat , whatever it was , came back to her : she had a vague foreboding and thought that on the chance she had better hold something ready . When she got home she found his telegram , and she told me he was the first person she saw in the house , through her fright when she came on in the second act . It appears she was terrified this time , and it lasted half through the play . "
251522	251534	251535	251536	Miss Tressilian	317	" She must be rather annoyed at his having gone away , "
251539	251548	251550	251550	Nick	224	" Annoyed ? I 'm not so sure ! "
251552	251559	251561	251561	Biddy	134	" Ah here he comes back ! "
251612	251623	251625	251626	Miss Tressilian	317	" After that he 'll surely come and see you , "
251628	251638	251639	251639	Biddy	134	" We shall see him as we go out , "
251642	251650	251639	251639	Biddy	134	" he must lose no more time . "
251662	251674	251651	251651	Nick	224	" Well , I 'm glad he has pulled himself together ! "
251675	251693	251694	251695	Miss Tressilian	317	" Why what 's the matter with him - if he was n't disappointed of his seat ? "
251698	251716	251694	251695	Miss Tressilian	317	" The matter with him is that a couple of hours ago he had a great shock . "
251717	251722	251651	251651	Nick	224	" A great shock ? "
251723	251733	251734	251734	Nick	224	" I may as well mention it at last , "
251738	251791	251734	251734	Nick	224	" I had to say something to him in the lobby there when we met - something I was pretty sure he could n't like . I let him have it full in the face - it seemed to me better and wiser . I let him know that Juliet 's married . "
251792	251799	251801	251801	Biddy	134	" Did n't he know it ? "
251824	251890	251734	251734	Nick	224	" How should he have known it ? It has only just taken place , and they 've been so clever , for reasons of their own - those people move among a lot of considerations that are absolutely foreign to us - about keeping it out of the papers . They put in a lot of lies and they leave out the real things . "
251891	251905	251906	251907	Miss Tressilian	317	" You do n't mean to say Mr. Sherringham wanted to marry her ! "
251910	251997	251734	251734	Nick	224	" Do n't ask me what he wanted - I daresay we shall never know . One thing 's very certain - that he did n't like my news , dear old Peter , and that I sha n't soon forget the look in his face as he turned away from me and slipped out into the street . He was too much upset - he could n't trust himself to come back ; he had to walk about - he tried to walk it off . "
251998	252011	251734	251734	Nick	224	" Let us hope , then , he has walked it off ! "
252012	252050	251734	251734	Nick	224	" Ah poor fellow - he could n't hold out to the end ; he has had to come back and look at her once more . He knows she 'll be sublime in these last scenes . "
252051	252077	251734	251734	Nick	224	" Is he so much in love with her as that ? What difference does it make for an actress if she is mar - ? "
252089	252195	252196	252196	Nick	224	" We shall probably never know how much he has been in love with her , nor what difference it makes . We shall never know exactly what he came back for , nor why he could n't stand it out there any longer without relief , nor why he scrambled down here all but straight from the station , nor why after all , for the last two hours , he has been roaming the streets . And it does n't matter , for it 's none of our business . But I 'm sorry for him - she is going to be sublime , "
253031	253035	253029	253029	I	0	" even now , "
