The wind continued to beat - about the corners of the hut , but the flute - playing ceased . A rectangular space of light appeared in the side of the hut , and in the opening the outline of Farmer Oak 's figure . He carried a lantern in his hand , and closing the door behind him , came forward and busied himself about this nook of the field for nearly twenty minutes , the lantern light appear- ing and disappearing here and there , and brightening him or darkening him as he stood before or behind it . Oak 's motions , though they had a quiet - energy , were slow , and their deliberateness accorded well with his occupation . Fitness being the basis of beauty , nobody could - have denied that his steady swings and turns "

Passing from the profoundest sleep to the most alert wakefulness with the same ease that had accompanied the reverse operation , he looked at his watch , found that the hour- hand had shifted again , put on his hat , took the lamb in his arms , and carried it into the darkness . After placing the little creature with its mother , he stood and carefully examined the sky , to ascertain the time of night from the altitudes of the stars . The Dog - star and Aldebaran , pointing to the restless Pleiades , were half - way up the Southern sky , and between them hung Orion , which gorgeous constellation never burnt more vividly than now , as it soared forth above the rim of the landscape . Castor and Pollux will the north - west ; far away through the plantation Vega and Cassiopeia 's chair stood daintily poised on the uppermost boughs . "
4418	4911	4968	4968	I	0	" said Gabriel . Being a man not without a frequent consciousness that there was some charm in this life he led , he stood still after looking at the sky as a useful instrument , and regarded it in an appreciative spirit , as a work of art superlatively beautiful . For a moment he seemed impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene , or rather with the complete abstraction from all its compass of the sights and sounds of man . Human shapes , interferences , troubles , and joys were all as if they were not , and there seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no sentient being save himself ; he could fancy them all gone round to the sunny side . Occupied this , with eyes stretched afar , Oak gradually per- ceived that what he had previously taken to be a star low down behind the outskirts of the plantation was in reality no such thing . It was an artificial light , almost close at hand . To find themselves utterly alone at night where company is desirable and expected makes some people fearful ; but a case more trying by far to the nerves is to discover some mysterious companionship when intuition , sensation , memory , analogy , testimony , probability , induction - every kind of evidence in the logician 's list - have united to persuade con- sciousness that it is quite in isolation . Farmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed through its lower boughs to the windy side . A dim mass under the slope reminded him that a shed occupied a place here , the site being a cutting into the slope of the hill , so that at its back part the roof was almost level with the ground . In front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with tar as a preservative . Through crevices in the roof and side spread streaks and spots of light , a combination of which made the radiance that had attracted him . Oak stepped up behind , where , leaning down upon the roof and putting his eye close to a hole , he could see into the interior clearly . The place contained two women and two cows . By the side of the latter a steaming bran - mash stood in a bucket . One of the women was past middle age . Her companion was ap- parently young and graceful ; he could form no decided opinion upon her looks , her position being almost beneath his eye , so that he saw her in a bird's - eye view , as Milton 's Satan first saw Paradise . She wore no bonnet or het , but had enveloped her- self in a large cloak , which was carelessly flung over her head as a covering . "
4920	4946	4947	4947	I	0	" said the elder of the two , resting her knuckles upon her hips , and looking at their goings - on as a whole . "
4980	5004	4968	4968	I	0	" The young woman , whose eyelids were apparently inclined to fall together on the smallest provocation of silence , yawned in sympathy . "

5087	5227	5228	5228	I	0	" The cow standing erect was of the Devon breed , and was encased in a tight warm hide of rich Indian red , as absolutely uniform from eyes to tail as if the animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour , her long back being mathematically level . The other was spotted , grey and white . Beside her Oak now noticed a little calf about a day old , looking idiotically at the two women , which showed that it had not long been accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight , and often turn- ing to the lantern , which it apparently mistook for the moon . inherited instinct having as yet had little time for correction by experience . Between the sheep and the cows Lucina had been busy on Norcombe hill lately . "

5282	6759	6760	6760	I	0	" Oak , upon hearing these remarks , became more curious to observe her features , but this prospect being denied him by the hooding effect of the cloak , and by his aerial position , he felt himself drawing upon his fancy for their details . In making even horizontal and clear inspections we colour and mould according to the warts within us whatever our eyes bring in . Had Gabriel been able from the first to get a distinct view of her - countenance , his estimate of it as very handsome or slightly so would have been as his soul required a divinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one . Having for some time known the want of a satisfactory form to fill an increasing void within him , his position moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy , he painted her a beauty . By one of those whimsical coincidences in which Nature , like a busy mother , seems to spare a moment from her unremitting labours to turn and make her children smile , the girl now dropped the cloak , and forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket . Oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow waggon , myrtles , and looking - glass : prosily , as the woman who owed him twopence . They placed the calf beside its mother again , took up the lantern , and went out , the light sinking down the hill till it was no more than a nebula . Gabriel Oak returned to his flock . CHAPTER III A GIRL ON HORSEBACK - CONVERSATION THE sluggish day began to break . Even its position terrestrially is one of the elements of a new interest , and for no particular reason save that the incident of the night had occurred there , Oak went again into the plantation . Lingering and musing here , he heard the steps of a horse at the foot of the hill , and soon there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on its back , ascending by the path leading past the cattle- shed . She was the young woman of the night before . Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having lost in the wind ; possibly she had come to look for it . He hastily scanned the ditch and after walking about ten yards along it , found the hat among the leaves . Gabriel took it in his hand and returned to his hut . Here he ensconced himself , and peeped through the loophole in the direction of the riders approach . She came up and looked around - then on the other side of the hedge . Gabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when an unexpected per- formance induced him to suspend the action for the present . The path , after passing the cowshed , bisected the plantation . It was not a bridle - path - merely a pedestrian 's track , and the boughs spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground , which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them . The girl , who wore no riding - habit , looked around for a moment , as if to assure herself that all humanity was out of view , then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony 's back , her head over its tail , her feet against its shoulders , and her eyes to the sky . The rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a kingfisher - its noiselessness that of a hawk . Gabriel 's eyes had scarcely been able to follow her . The tall lank pony seemed used to such doings , and ambled along unconcerned . Thus she passed under the level boughs . The performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse 's head and its tail , and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having ceased with the passage of the plantation , she began to adopt another , even more obviously convenient than the first . She had no side - saddle , and it was very apparent that a firm seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was un- attainable sideways . Springing to her accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling , and satisfying her , self that nobody was in sight , she seated herself in the manner demanded by the saddle , though hardly expected of the woman , and trotted off in the direction of Tewnell Mill . Oak was amused , perhaps a little astonished , and hanging up the hat in his hut , went again among his ewes . An hour passed , the girl returned , properly seated now , with a bag of bran in front of her . On nearing the cattle - shed she was met by a boy bringing a milking - pail , who held the reins of the pony whilst she slid off . The boy led away the horse , leaving the pail with the young woman . Soon soft shirts alternating with loud shirts came in regular succession from within the shed , the obvious sounds of a person milking a cow . Gabriel took the lost hat in his hand , and waited beside the path she would follow in leaving the hill . She came , the pail in one hand , hanging against her knee . The left arm was extended as a balance , enough of it being shown bare to make Oak wish that the event ha happened in the summer , when the whole would have been revealed . There was a bright air and manner about her now , by which she seemed to imply that the desirability of her existence could not be questioned ; and this rather saucy assumption failed in being offensive , because a beholder felt it to be , upon the whole , true . Like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius , that which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an addition to recognised power . It was with some surprise that she saw Gabriel 's face rising like the moon behind the hedge . The adjustment of the farmer 's hazy conceptions of her charms to the portrait of herself she now presented him with was less a diminution than a difference . The starting - point selected by the judgment was . her height She seemed tall , but the pail was a small one , and the hedge diminutive ; hence , making allowance for error by comparison with these , she could have been not above the height to be chosen by women as best . All features of consequence were severe and regular . It may have been observed by persons who go about the shires with eyes for beauty , that in Englishwoman a classically - formed face is seldom found to be united with a figure of the same pattern , the highly - finished features being generally too large for the remainder of the frame ; that a graceful and proportionate figure of eight heads usually goes off into random facial curves . Without throwing a Nymphean tissue over a milkmaid , let it be said that here criticism checked itself as out of place , and looked at her proportions with a long consciousness of pleasure . From the contours of her figure in its upper part , she must have had a beautiful neck and shoulders ; but since her infancy nobody had ever seen them . Had she been put into a low dress she would have run and thrust her head into a bush . Yet she was not a shy girl by any means ; it was merely her instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the unseen higher than they do it in towns . That the girl 's thoughts hovered about her face and form as soon as she caught Oak 's eyes conning the same page was natural , and almost certain . The self- consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little more pronounced , dignity if a little less . Rays of male vision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces in rural districts ; she brushed hers with her hand , as if Gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual touch , and the free air of her previous movements was reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of itself . Yet it was the man who blushed , the maid not at all . "

7004	7022	6984	6984	you	0	" she inquired , a misgiving bringing every muscle of her lineaments and frame to a standstill . "
7036	7874	7909	7909	she	566	" said Farmer Oak , with an aspect excessively knowing with regard to some matter in his mind , as he gazed at a remote point in the direction named , and then turned back to meet his colloquist 's eyes . A perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes from hers as suddenly as if he had been caught in a theft . Recollection of the strange antics she had indulged in when passing through the trees , was suc- ceeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation , and that by a hot face . It was a time to see a woman redden who was not given to reddening as a rule ; not a point in the milkmaid but was of the deepest rose - colour . From the Maiden 's Blush , through all varieties of the Provence down to the Crimson Tuscany , the countenance of Oak 's acquaintance quickly graduated ; whereupon he , in con- siderateness , turned away his head . The sympathetic man still looked the other way , and wondered when she would recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again . He heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the breeze , and looked . She had gone away . With an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy ! Gabriel returned to his work . Five mornings and evenings passed . The young woman came regularly to milk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one , but never allowed her vision to stray in the direction of Oak 's person . His want of tact had deeply offended her - not by seeing what he could not help , but by letting her know that he had seen it . For , as without law there is no sin , without eyes there is no indecorum ; and she appeared to feel that Gabriel 's espial had made her an indecorous woman without her own connivance . It was food for great regret with him ; it was also a contretemps which touched into life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction . The acquaintanceship might , however , have ended in a slow forgetting , but for an incident which occurred at the end of the same week . One afternoon it began to freeze , and the frost increased with evening , which drew on like a stealthy tightening of bonds . It was a time when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets ; when round the drawing - room fire of a thick - walled mansion the sitters ' backs are cold , even whilst their faces are all aglow . Many a small bird went to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs . As the milking - hour drew near , Oak kept his usual watch upon the cowshed . At last he felt cold , and shaking an extra quantity of bedding round the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon the stove . The wind came in at the bottom of the door , and to prevent it Oak laid a sack there and wheeled the cot round a little more to the south . Then the wind spouted in at a ventilating hole - of which there was one on each side of the hut . Gabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door closed one of these must be kept open - that chosen being always on the side away from the wind . Closing the slide to windward , he turned to open the other ; on second - thoughts the farmer con- sidered that he would first sit down leaving both closed for a minute or two , till the temperature of the hut was a little raised . He sat down . His head began to ache in an unwonted manner , and , fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights , Oak decided to get up , open the slide , and then allow himself to fall asleep . He fell asleep , however , without having performed the necessary preliminary . How long he remained unconscious Gabriel never knew . During the first stages of his return to percep- tion peculiar deeds seemed to be in course of enactment . His dog was howling , his head was aching fearfully - somebody was pulling him about , hands were loosening his neckerchief . On opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk to dusk in a strange manner of unexpectedness . The young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips and white teeth was beside him . More than this - astonishingly more - his head was upon her lap , his face and neck were disagreeably wet , and her fingers were unbuttoning his collar . "
7880	7904	7909	7909	she	566	" said Oak , vacantly . She seemed to experience mirth , but of too insignifi- ca nt a kind to start enjoyment . "
7933	7934	7909	7909	she	566	" "
7940	7944	7909	7909	she	566	" murmured Gabriel . "
7992	8008	8054	8054	I	0	" Gabriel , by way of emphasis , brought down his fist upon the floor . "
8019	8051	8052	8052	You	567	" she ob- served in a tone which showed her to be that novelty among women - one who finished a thought before beginning the sentence which was to convey it . "
8073	8074	8052	8052	You	567	" "
8081	8183	8052	8052	You	567	" said Oak , absently . He was endeavouring to catch and appreciate the sensation of being thus with her , his head upon her dress , before the event passed on into the heap of bygone things . He wished she knew his impressions ; but he would as soon have thought of carrying an odour in a net as of attempting to convey the intangibilities of his feeling in the coarse meshes of language . So he remained silent . She made him sit up , and then Oak began wiping his face and shaking himself like a Samson . "
8191	8211	8186	8186	I	0	" he said at last , gratefully , some of the natural rusty red having returned to his face . "
8218	8245	8186	8186	I	0	" said the girl , smiling , and allowing her smile to hold good for Gabriel 's next remark , whatever that might prove to be . "

8437	8476	8403	8403	I	0	" the girl replied . She seemed to prefer a less tragic probability ; to have saved a man from death involved talk that should harmonise with the dignity of such a deed - and she shunned it . "

8736	8789	8709	8709	your	584	" she said , and gave him her hand , compressing her lips to a demure impassivity . He held it but an instant , and in his fear of being too demonstrative , swerved to the opposite extreme , touching her fingers with the lightness of a small - hearted person . "
8794	8802	8790	8790	I	0	" he said , the instant after . "
8806	8807	8808	8808	You	584	" "
8821	8841	8808	8808	You	584	" She gave him her hand again . Oak held it longer this time - indeed , curiously long . "
8860	8864	8808	8808	You	584	" he said . "
8872	8882	8808	8808	You	584	" said she , though with- out pulling it away "

8931	8948	8927	8927	you	0	" She snatched back her hand . Gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact . "
8955	9403	8927	8927	you	0	" she said , teasingly ; and withdrew . CHAPTER IV GABRIEL 'S RESOLVE - THE VISIT - THE MISTAKE THE only superiority in women that is tolerable to the rival sex is , as a rule , that of the unconscious kind ; but a superiority which recognizes itself may sometimes please by suggesting possibilities of capture to the subordinated man . This well - favoured and comely girl soon made appre- ciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young Farmer Oak . Love , being an extremely exacting usurer a sense of exorbitant profit , spiritually , by an exchange of hearts , being at the bottom of pure passions , as that of exorbi- tant profit , bodily or materially , is at the bottom of those of lower atmosphere , every morning Oak 's feelings were as sensitive as the money - market in calculations upon his chances . His dog waited for his meals in a way so like that in which Oak waited for the girl 's presence , that the farmer was quite struck with the resemblance , felt it lowering , and would not look at the dog . However , he continued to watch through the hedge for her regular coming , and thus his sentiments towards her were deepened without any corresponding effect being produced upon herself . Oak had nothing finished and ready to say as yet , and not being able to frame love phrases which end where they begin ; passionate tales - - Full of sound and fury - signifying nothing - he said no word at all . By making inquiries he found that the girl 's name was Bathsheba Everdene , and that the cow would go dry in about seven days . He dreaded the eight day . At last the eighth day came . The cow had ceased to give milk for that year , and Bathsheba Everdene came up the hill no more . Gabriel had reached a pitch of existence he never could have anticipated a short time before . He liked saying ` Bathsheba ' as a private enjoyment instead of whistling ; turned over his taste to black hair , though he had sworn by brown ever since he was a boy , isolated himself till the space he filled in a possible strength in an actual weakness . Marriage transforms a distraction into a support , the power of which should be , and happily often is , in direct pro- portion to the degree of imbecility it supplants . Oak began now to see light in this direction , and said to himself , "
9422	10039	10057	10057	he	587	" All this while he was perplexing himself about an errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage of Bathsheba 's aunt . He found his opportunity in the death of a ewe , mother of a living lamb . On a day which had a summer face and a winter constitution - a fine January morning , when there was just enough blue sky visible to make cheerfully - disposed people wish for more , and an occasional gleam of silvery sunshine , Oak put the lamb into a respectable Sunday basket , and stalked across the fields to the house of Mrs. Hurst , the aunt - George , the dog walking behind , with a countenance of great concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking . Gabriel had watched the blue wood - smoke curling from the chimney with strange meditation . At evening he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the spot of its origin - seen the hearth and Bathsheba beside it - beside it in her out - door dress ; for the clothes she had worn on the hill were by association equally with her person included in the compass of his affection ; they seemed at this early time of his love a necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bath- sheba Everdene . He had made a toilet of a nicely - adjusted kind - of a nature between the carefully neat and the carelessly ornate - of a degree between fine - market - day and wet- Sunday selection . He thoroughly cleaned his silver watch - chain with whiting , put new lacing straps to his boots , looked to the brass eyelet - holes , went to the inmost heart of the plantation for a new walking - stick , and trimmed it vigorously on his way back ; took a new handkerchief from the bottom of his clothes - box , put on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose and lily without the defects of either , and used all the hair - oil he possessed upon his usually dry , sandy , and inextricably curly hair , till he had deepened it to a splendidly novel colour , between that of guano and Roman cement , making it stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg , or wet seaweed round a boulder after the ebb . Nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save the chatter of a knot of sparrows on the eaves ; one might fancy scandal and rumour to be no less the staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of those under them . It seemed that the omen was an unpropitious one , for , as the rather untoward commence- ment of Oak 's overtures , just as he arrived by the garden gate , he saw a cat inside , going into various arched shapes and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his dog George . The dog took no notice , for he had arrived at an age at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of breath - in fact he never barked even at the sheep except to order , when it was done with an absolutely neutral countenance , as a sort of Com- mination - service , which , though offensive , had to be gone through once now and then to frighten the flock for their own good . A voice came from behind some laurel - bushes into which the cat had run : "
10061	10062	10057	10057	he	587	" "
10068	10075	10057	10057	he	587	" said Oak to the voice , "
10091	10212	10077	10077	George	166	" Almost before he had ceased speaking , Oak was seized with a misgiving as to whose ear was the recipient of his answer . Nobody appeared , and he heard the person retreat among the bushes . Gabriel meditated , and so deeply that he brought small furrows into his forehead by sheer force of reverie . Where the issue of an interview is as likely to be a vast change for the worse as for the better , any initial difference from expectation causes nipping sensations of failure . Oak went up to the door a little abashed : his mental rehearsal and the reality had had no common grounds of opening . Bathsheba 's aunt was indoors . "
10228	10297	10214	10214	you	589	" said Mr. Oak . Calling one 's self merely Some- body , without giving a name , is not to be taken as an example of the ill - breeding of the rural world : it springs from a refined modesty , of which townspeople , with their cards and announcements , have no notion whatever . Bathsheba was out . The voice had evidently been hers . "
10306	10307	10299	10299	you	589	" "
10323	10345	10315	10315	Gabriel	144	" I 've brought a lamb for Miss Everdene . I thought she might like one to rear ; girls do . "
10346	10350	10352	10353	Mrs. Hurst	165	" She might . "
10357	10378	10352	10353	Mrs. Hurst	165	" though she 's only a visitor here . If you will wait a minute , Bathsheba will be in . "
10379	10386	10388	10388	Gabriel	144	" Yes , I will wait . "
10393	10425	10388	10388	Gabriel	144	" The lamb is n't really the business I came about , Mrs. Hurst . In short , I was going to ask her if she 'd like to be married . "
10426	10432	10315	10315	Gabriel	144	" And were you indeed ? "
10433	10466	10388	10388	Gabriel	144	" Yes . Because if she would , I should be very glad to marry her . D'ye know if she 's got any other young man hanging about her at all ? "
10467	10472	10474	10475	Mrs. Hurst	165	" Let me think , "
10482	10556	10388	10388	Gabriel	144	" Yes - bless you , ever so many young men . You see , Farmer Oak , she 's so good - looking , and an excellent scholar besides - she was going to be a governess once , you know , only she was too wild . Not that her young men ever come here - but , Lord , in the nature of women , she must have a dozen ! "
10557	10562	10564	10565	Farmer Oak	143	" That 's unfortunate . "
10577	10632	10564	10565	Farmer Oak	143	" I 'm only an every - day sort of man , and my only chance was in being the first comer ... , Well , there 's no use in my waiting , for that was all I came about : so I 'll take myself off home - along , Mrs. Hurst . "
10648	10653	10564	10565	Farmer Oak	143	" hoi - hoi ! "
10736	10742	10743	10743	she	592	" Farmer Oak - I - "
10769	10778	10780	10780	Gabriel	144	" I have just called to see you , "
10787	10794	10795	10795	she	592	" Yes - I know that ! "
10823	10871	10872	10872	Gabriel	144	" I did n't know you had come to ask to have me , or I should have come in from the garden instantly . I ran after you to say - that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from courting me - - - "
10875	10888	10889	10889	he	144	"I'm sorry to have made you run so fast , my dear . "
10901	10912	10889	10889	he	144	" Wait a bit till you 've found your breath . "
10913	10930	10942	10943	a sweetheart	594	" - It was quite a mistake - aunt 's telling you I had a young man "
10933	10938	10889	10889	he	144	"- Bathsheba went on . "
10979	10980	10984	10984	I	0	" "
10991	11066	11088	11088	he	144	" said Farmer Oak , smiling one of his long special smiles , and blushing with gladness . He held out his hand to take hers , which , when she had eased her side by pressing it there , was prettily extended upon her bosom to still her loud - beating heart . Directly he seized it she put it behind her , so that it slipped through his fingers like an eel . "
11067	11076	11078	11078	Gabriel	144	" I have a nice snug little farm . "
11094	11100	11088	11088	he	144	" Yes ; you have . "
11101	11146	11147	11147	Gabriel	144	" A man has advanced me money to begin with , but still , it will soon be paid off and though I am only an every - day sort of man , I have got on a little since I was a boy . "
11149	11152	11147	11147	Gabriel	144	" a little "
11167	11172	11147	11147	Gabriel	144	" a great deal . "
11176	11197	11198	11198	He	144	" When we be married , I am quite sure I can work twice as hard as I do now . "
11259	11265	11266	11266	she	0	" Why , Farmer Oak . "
11280	11291	11266	11266	she	0	" I never said I was going to marry you . "
11292	11300	11302	11302	Oak	143	" Well - that is a tale ! "
11307	11324	11302	11302	Oak	143	" To run after anybody like this , and then say you do n't want him ! "
11325	11336	11337	11337	she	0	" What I meant to tell you was only this . "
11357	11447	11337	11337	she	0	" that nobody has got me yet as a sweetheart , instead of my having a dozen , as my aunt said ; I hate to be thought men 's property in that way , though possibly I shall be had some day . Why , if I 'd wanted you I should n't have run after you like this ; ' twould have been the forwardest thing ! But there was no harm in ' hurrying to correct a piece of false news that had been told you . "
11448	11458	11302	11302	Oak	143	" Oh , no - no harm at all . "
11489	11502	11477	11477	Oak	143	" Well , I am not quite certain it was no harm . "
11503	11532	11337	11337	she	0	" Indeed , I had n't time to think before starting whether I wanted to marry or not , for you 'd have been gone over the hill . "
11533	11536	11538	11538	Gabriel	144	" Come . "
11543	11576	11538	11538	Gabriel	144	" think a minute or two . I 'll wait a while , Miss Everdene . Will you marry me ? Do , Bathsheba . I love you far more than common ! "
11577	11584	11585	11585	she	599	" I 'll try to think . "
11593	11608	11585	11585	she	599	" if I can think out of doors ; my mind spreads away so . "
11609	11617	11538	11538	Gabriel	144	" But you can give a guess . "
11618	11624	11585	11585	she	599	" Then give me time . "
11642	11649	11651	11651	he	144	" I can make you happy , "
11663	11702	11651	11651	he	144	" You shall have as piano in a year or two - farmers ' wives are getting to have pianos now - and I 'll practise up the flute right well to play with you in the evenings . "
11703	11711	11651	11651	he	144	" Yes ; I should like that . "
11712	11722	11651	11651	he	144	" And have one of those little ten - pound "
11745	11756	11757	11757	I	0	" continued Gabriel , feeling balanced between poetry and practicality . "
11764	11765	11757	11757	I	0	" "
11778	11781	11776	11776	lady	601	" Yes . "
11782	11802	11757	11757	I	0	" And when the wedding was over , we 'd have it put in the newspaper list of marriages . "
11803	11810	11776	11776	lady	601	" Dearly I should like that ! "
11811	11823	11757	11757	I	0	" And the babies in the births - every man jack of "
11853	11854	11851	11851	you	599	" "
11863	11914	11757	11757	I	0	" Her countenance fell , and she was silent awhile . He regarded the red berries between them over and over again , to such an extent , that holly seemed in his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of marriage . Bathsheba decisively turned to him . "
11917	11923	11924	11924	she	603	" ' tis no use . "
11927	11936	11924	11924	she	603	" I do n't want to marry you . "
11937	11940	12009	12009	you	599	" Try . "
11941	11995	11924	11924	she	603	" I have tried hard all the time I 've been thinking ; for a marriage would be very nice in one sense . People would talk about me , and think I had won my battle , and I should feel triumphant , and all that , But a husband - - - "
11998	11999	11924	11924	she	603	" "
12022	12023	12026	12026	he	604	" "
12034	12035	12026	12026	he	604	" "
12087	12088	12078	12078	I	0	" "
12096	12118	12078	12078	I	0	" At this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made an addition to her dignity by a slight sweep away from him . "
12138	12142	12130	12131	a maid	608	" said Oak . "
12146	12154	12130	12131	a maid	608	" he continued in a palliative voice , "
12161	12197	12130	12131	a maid	608	" Oak sighed a deep honest sigh - none the less so in that , being like the sigh of a pine plantation , it was rather noticeable as a disturbance of the atmo- sphere . "
12205	12218	12219	12219	I	0	" he appealed , creeping round the holly to reach her side . "
12223	12229	12219	12219	I	0	" she said , retreating . "
12233	12254	12219	12219	I	0	" he persisted , standing still at last in despair of ever reaching her , and facing over the bush . "
12262	12263	12256	12256	I	0	" "
12269	12290	12256	12256	I	0	" She contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness , so that it was hardly ill - mannered at all . "
12297	12301	12291	12291	I	0	" she said . "
12302	12321	12351	12351	he	146	" But I love you - and , as for myself , I am content to be liked . "
12322	12339	12345	12346	Mr Oak	146	" O Mr. Oak - that 's very fine ! You 'd get to despise me . "
12340	12343	12345	12346	Mr Oak	146	" Never . "
12373	12406	12351	12351	he	146	" I shall do one thing in this life - one thing certain - that is , love you , and long for you , and keep wanting you till I die . "
12423	12438	12439	12439	she	0	" It seems dreadfully wrong not to have you when you feel so much ! "
12460	12472	12439	12439	she	0	" H ow I wish I had n't run after you ! "
12495	12527	12528	12528	Oak	146	" It would n't do , Mr Oak . I want somebody to tame me ; I am too independent ; and you would never be able to , I know . "
12547	12551	12552	12552	she	0	" Mr. Oak . "
12562	12657	12552	12552	she	0	" you are better off than I. I have hardly a penny in the world - I am staying with my aunt for my bare sustenance . I am better educated than you - and I do n't love you a bit : that 's my side of the case . Now yours : you are a farmer just begin- ing ; and you ought in common prudence , if you marry at all which you should certainly not think of doing at present to marry a woman with money , who would admiration . "
12669	12709	12552	12552	she	0	" he naively said . Farmer Oak had one - and - a - half Christian character- istics too many to succeed with Bathsheba : his humility , and a superfluous moiety of honesty . Bathsheba was decidedly disconcerted , "
12722	12742	12716	12716	you	0	" she said , almost angrily , if not quite , an enlarging red spot rising in each cheek . "
12757	12758	12748	12748	I	0	" "
12761	12762	12748	12748	I	0	" "
12767	12768	12748	12748	I	0	" "
12779	12794	12776	12777	Mr. Oak	146	" she exclaimed , with even more hauteur , and rocking her head disdainfully . "
12812	12818	12808	12808	I	0	" He broke in passionately . "
12945	12946	12925	12925	I	0	" "
12977	13004	12965	12965	I	0	" he said , with a laugh . No man likes to see his emotions the sport of a merry - go - round of skittishness . "
13008	13024	13025	13025	his	613	" said Oak , firmly , with the bearing of one who was going to give "
13034	13043	13025	13025	his	613	" Then I 'll ask you no more . "
13479	13483	13496	13496	he	166	" Come in ! "
13485	13494	13496	13496	he	166	" D - - ye , come in ! "
13934	14148	13932	13933	the sheep	644	" chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by ceasing ever distant , that all is well in the fold . In the solemn This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways - by the rapid feeding of the sheep bearing the bell , as when the flock breaks into new pasture , which gives it an intermittent rapidity , or by the sheep starting off in a run , when the sound has a regular palpitation . The experienced ear of Oak knew the sound he now heard to be caused by the running of the flock with great velocity . He jumped out of bed , dressed , tore down the lane through a foggy dawn , and ascended the hill . The forward ewes were kept apart from those among which the fall of lambs would be later , there being two hundred of the latter class in Gabriel 's flock . These two hundred seemed to have absolutely vanished from the hill . There were the fifty with their lambs , enclosed at the other end as he had left them , but the rest , forming the bulk of the flock , were nowhere . Gabriel called at the top of his voice the shepherd 's call . "
14155	14637	13932	13933	the sheep	644	" Not a single bleat . He went to the hedge - a gap had been broken through it , and in the gap were the footprints of the sheep . Rather surprised to find them break fence at this season , yet putting it down instantly to their great fondness for ivy in winter - time , of which a great deal grew in the plantation , he followed through the hedge . They were not in the plantation . He called again : the valleys and farthest hills resounded as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian shore ; but no sheep . He passed through the trees and along the ridge of the hill . On the extreme summit , where the ends of the two converging hedges of which we have spoken were stopped short by meeting the brow of the chalk - pit , he saw the younger dog standing against the sky - dark and motionless as Napoleon at St. Helena . A horrible conviction darted through Oak . With a sensation of bodily faintness he advanced : at one point the rails were broken through , and there he saw the footprints of his ewes . The dog came up , licked his hand , and made signs implying that he expected some great reward for signal services rendered . Oak looked over the precipice . The ewes lay dead and dying at its foot - a heap of two hundred mangled carcasses , representing in their condition just now at least two hundred more . Oak was an intensely humane man : indeed , his humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy , and carried him on as by gravitation . A shadow in his life had always been that his flock ended in mutton - that a day came and found every shepherd an arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep . His first feeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn lambs . It was a second to remember another phase of the matter . The sheep were not insured . All the savings of a frugal life had been dispersed at a blow ; his hopes of being an independent farmer were laid low - possibly for ever . Gabriel 's energies , patience , and industry had been so severely taxed during the years of his life between eighteen and eight - and - twenty , to reach his present stage of progress that no more seemed to be left in him . He hands . Stupors , however , do not last for ever , and Farmer Oak recovered from his . It was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one sentence he uttered was in thankfulness : - "
14658	15243	14647	14647	she	645	" Oak raised his head , and wondering what he could do listlessly surveyed the scene . By the outer margin of the Pit was an oval pond , and over it hung the attenuated skeleton of a chrome - yellow moon which had only a few days to last - the morning star dogging her on the left hand . The pool glittered like a dead man 's eye , and as the world awoke a breeze blew , shaking and elongating the reflection of the moon without breaking it , and turning the image of the star to a phosphoric streak upon the water . All this Oak saw and remembered . As far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor young dog , still under the impression that since he was kept for running after sheep , the more he ran after them the better , had at the end of his meal off the dead lamb , which may have given him additional energy and spirits , collected all the ewes into a corner , driven the timid creatures through the hedge , across the upper field , and by main force of worrying had given them momentum enough to break down a portion of the rotten railing , and so hurled them over the edge . George 's son had done his work so thoroughly that he was considered too good a workman to live , and was , in fact , taken and tragically shot at twelve o'clock that same day - another instance of the untoward fate which so often attends dogs and other philosophers who follow out a train of reasoning to its logical conclusion , and attempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world made up so largely of compromise . Gabriel 's farm had been stocked by a dealer - on the strength of Oak 's promising look and character - who was receiving a percentage from the farmer till such time as the advance should be cleared off Oak found- that the value of stock , plant , and implements which were really his own would be about sufficient to pay his debts , leaving himself a free man with the clothes he stood up in , and nothing more . CHAPTER VI THE FAIR - THE JOURNEY - THE FIRE TWO months passed away . We are brought on to a day in February , on which was held the yearly statute or hiring fair in the county - town of Casterbridge . At one end of the street stood from two to three hundred blithe and hearty labourers waiting upon Chance - all men of the stamp to whom labour suggests nothing worse than a wrestle with gravitation , and pleasure nothing better than a renunciation of the same among these , carters and waggoners were distinguished by having a piece of whip - cord twisted round their hats ; thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw ; shepherds held their sheep - crooks in their hands ; and thus the situation required was known to the hirers at a glance . In the crowd was an athletic young fellow of some- what superior appearance to the rest - in fact , his superiority was marked enough to lead several ruddy peasants standing by to speak to him inquiringly , as to a farmer , and to use ` Sir ' as a finishing word . His answer always was , "
15265	15516	15257	15257	Ye	647	" Gabriel was paler now . His eyes were more medi- tative , and his expression was more sad . He had passed through an ordeal of wretchedness which had given him more than it had taken away . He had sunk from his modest elevation as pastoral king into the very slime - pits of Siddim ; but there was left to him a digni- fied calm he had never before known , and that indiffer- ence to fate which , though it often makes a villain of a man , is the basis of his sublimity when it does not . And thus the abasement had been exaltation , and the loss gain . In the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the town , and a sergeant and his party had been beating up for recruits through the four streets . As the end of the day drew on , and he found himself not hired , Gabriel almost wished that he had joined them , and gone off to serve his country . Weary of standing in the market- place , and not much minding the kind of work he turned his hand to , he decided to offer himself in some other capacity than that of bailiff . All the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds . Sheep - tending was Gabriel 's speciality . Turning down an obscure street and entering an obscurer lane , he went up to a smith 's shop . "
15530	15531	15522	15522	you	649	" "
15535	15536	15522	15522	you	649	" "
15540	15541	15257	15257	Ye	647	" "
15545	15696	15257	15257	Ye	647	" He sat on a bench and the crook was made , a stem being given him into the bargain . He then went to a ready - made clothes ' shop , the owner of which had a large rural connection . As the crook had absorbed most of Gabriel 's money , he attempted , and carried out , an exchange of his overcoat for a shepherd 's regulation smock - frock . This transaction having been completed , he again hurried off to the centre of the town , and stood on the kerb of the pavement , as a shepherd , crook in hand . Now that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd , it seemed that bailifs were most in demand . However , two or three farmers noticed him and drew near . Dialogues followed , more or lessin the subjoined for : - "
15703	15704	15257	15257	Ye	647	" "
15707	15708	15257	15257	Ye	647	" "
15715	15719	15257	15257	Ye	647	" Fifteen miles . "
15720	15729	15257	15257	Ye	647	" Who 's farm were you upon last ? "
15730	15734	15257	15257	Ye	647	" My own . "
15891	15896	15882	15882	He	144	" Jockey to the Fair "
15979	15985	15966	15966	he	144	" How far is Shottsford ? "
15986	15994	16054	16054	Oak	144	" Ten miles t'other side of Weatherbury . "
16017	16025	15966	15966	he	144	" How far is it to Weatherbury ? "
16026	16032	16033	16033	Bathsheba	243	" Five or six miles . "
16296	16303	16270	16270	He	144	" cu - uck , cuck , "
16901	16945	16874	16875	the waggoner	461	" Be as ' twill , she 's a fine handsome body as far 's looks be concerned . But that 's only the skin of the woman , and these dandy cattle be as - proud as a lucifer in their insides . "
16946	16964	16874	16875	the waggoner	461	" Ay - so ' a do seem , Billy Smallbury - so ' a do seem . "
16997	17006	17007	17007	She	693	" from the man who held the reins . "
17022	17023	17007	17007	She	693	" "
17066	17067	17070	17070	she	693	" "
17098	17099	17085	17085	she	693	" "
17111	17112	17070	17070	she	693	" "
17152	17153	17959	17959	man	3450	" "
17178	17179	17175	17175	she	693	" "
17189	17956	17186	17187	Master Poorgrass	177	" On hearing these and other similar remarks , a wild thought flashed into Gabriel 's mind that they might be speaking of Bathsheba . There were , however , no ground for retaining such a supposition , for the waggon , though going in the direction of Weatherbury , might be going beyond it , and the woman alluded to seemed to be the mistress of some estate . They were now apparently close upon Weatherbury and not to alarm the speakers unnecessarily , Gabriel slipped out of the waggon unseen . He turned to an opening in the hedge , which he found to be a gate , and mounting thereon , he sat meditating whether to seek a cheap lodging in the village , or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under some hay or corn - stack . The crunching jangle of the waggon died upon his ear . He was about to walk on , when he noticed on his left hand an unusual light - appearing about half a mile distant . Oak watched it , and the glow increased . Something was on fire . Gabriel again mounted the gate , and , leaping down on the other side upon what he found to be ploughed soil , made across the field in the exact direction of the fire . The blaze , enlarging in a double ratio by his approach and its own increase , showed him as he drew nearer the outlines of ricks beside it , lighted up to great distinctness . A rick - yard was the source of the fire . His weary face now began to be painted over with a rich orange glow , and the whole front of his smock- frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow pattern of thorn - twigs - the light reaching him through a leafless intervening hedge - and the metallic curve of his sheep - crook shone silver - bright in the same abound- ing rays . He came up to the boundary fence , and stood to regain breath . It seemed as if the spot was unoccupied by a living soul . The fire was issuing from a long straw - stack , which was so far gone as to preclude a possibility of saving it . A rick burns differently from a house . As the wind blows the fire inwards , the portion in flames completely disappears like melting sugar , and the outline is lost to the eye . However , a hay or a wheat - rick , well put together , will resist combustion for a length of time , if it begins on the outside . This before Gabriel 's eyes was a- rick of straw , loosely put together , and the flames darted into it with lightning swiftness . It glowed on the windward side , rising and falling in intensity , like the coal of a cigar . Then a superincumbent bundle rolled down , with a whisking noise ; flames elongated , and bent themselves about with a quiet roar , but no crackle . Banks of smoke went off horizontally at the back like passing clouds , and behind these burned hidden pyres , illuminating the semi - transparent sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow uniformity . Individual straws in the foreground were consumed in a creeping movement of ruddy heat , as if they were knots of red worms , and above shone imaginary fiery faces , tongues hanging from lips , glaring eyes , and other impish forms , from which at intervals sparks flew in clusters like birds from a nest , Oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator by discovering the case to be more serious than he had at first imagined . A scroll of smoke blew aside and revealed to him a wheat - rick in startling juxtaposition with the decaying one , and behind this a series of others , composing the main corn produce of the farm ; so that instead of the straw - stack standing , as he had imagined comparatively isolated , there was a regular connection between it and the remaining stacks of the group . Gabriel leapt over the hedge , and saw that he was not alone . The first man he came to was running about in a great hurry , as if his thoughts were several yards in advance of his body , which they could never drag on fast enough . "
18016	18110	18013	18013	Matthew	181	" Other figures now appeared behind this shouting man and among the smoke , and Gabriel found that , far from being alone he was in a great company - whose shadows danced merrily up and down , timed by the jigging of the flames , and not at all by their owners ' movements . The assemblage - belonging to that class of society which casts its thoughts into the form of feeling , and its feelings into the form of commotion - set to work with a remarkable confusion of purpose . "
18120	18167	18013	18013	Matthew	181	" cried Gabriel to those nearest to him . The corn stood on stone staddles , and between these , tongues of yellow hue from the burning straw licked and darted playfully . If the fire once got under this stack , all would be lost . "
18174	18216	18013	18013	Matthew	181	" said Gabriel . A rick - cloth was brought , and they hung it like a curtain across the channel . The flames immediately ceased to go under the bottom of the corn - stack , and stood up vertical . "
18230	18257	18013	18013	Matthew	181	" said Gabriel again . The flames , now driven upwards , began to attack the angles of the huge roof covering the wheat - stack . "
18261	18265	18013	18013	Matthew	181	" cried Gabriel . "
18281	18312	18013	18013	Matthew	181	" said a spectre - like form in the smoke . Oak seized the cut ends of the sheaves , as if he were going to engage in the operation of "
18317	18585	18013	18013	Matthew	181	" and digging in his feet , and occasionally sticking in the stem of his sheep - crook , he clambered up the beetling face . He at once sat astride the very apex , and began with his crook to beat off the fiery fragments which had lodged thereon , shouting to the others to get him a bough and a ladder , and some water . Billy Smallbury - one of the men who had been on the waggon - by this time had found a ladder , which Mark Clark ascended , holding on beside Oak upon the thatch . The smoke at this corner was stifling , and Clark , a nimble fellow , having been handed a bucket of water , bathed Oak 's face and sprinkled him generally , whilst Gabriel , now with a long beech - bough in one hand , in addition to his crook in the other , kept sweeping the stack and dislodging all fiery particles . On the ground the groups of villagers were still occupied in doing all they could to keep down the conflagration , which was not much . They were all tinged orange , and backed up by shadows of varying pattern . Round the corner of the largest stack , out of the direct rays of the fire , stood a pony , bearing a young woman on its back . By her side was another woman , on foot . These two seemed to keep at a distance from the fire , that the horse might not become restive . "
18591	18598	18601	18601	he	709	" said the woman on foot . "
18641	18642	18635	18635	he	709	" "
18648	18657	18635	18635	he	709	" said the equestrian in a clear voice . "
18664	18665	18635	18635	he	709	" "
18674	18675	18676	18676	Nobody	439	" "
18692	18709	18689	18689	they	3772	" The young woman on the pony rode out from the shade and looked anxiously around . "
18718	18722	18711	18711	you	0	" she said . "
18733	18751	18730	18731	Jan Coggan	180	" said the second woman , passing on the question to the nearest man in that direction . "
18805	18806	18785	18785	he	723	" "
18812	18830	18831	18831	I	0	" said the young woman on horseback , looking up at Gabriel through her thick woollen veil . "
18847	18848	18842	18842	you	725	" "
18865	18892	18893	18893	Maryann	179	" The fire began to get worsted , and Gabriel 's elevated position being no longer required of him , he made as if to descend . "
18895	18902	18893	18893	Maryann	179	" said the girl on horseback , "
18928	18950	18893	18893	Maryann	179	" Maryann stalked off towards the rick and met Oak at the foot of the ladder . She delivered her message . "
18958	18976	18893	18893	Maryann	179	" asked Gabriel , kindling with the idea of getting employment that seemed to strike him now . "
18989	18990	18987	18987	shepherd	3738	" "
18995	18996	18993	18993	farmer	3460	" "
19009	19015	18993	18993	farmer	3460	" said a by- stander . "
19090	19091	19094	19094	she	737	" "
19102	19107	19094	19094	she	737	" said Mary- ann . "
19125	19213	19094	19094	she	737	" Oak , his features smudged , grimy , and undiscoverable from the smoke and heat , his smock - frock burnt - into holes and dripping with water , the ash stem of his sheep- crook charred six inches shorter , advansed with the humility stern adversity had thrust upon him up to the slight female form in the saddle . He lifted his hat with respect , and not without gallantry : stepping close to her hanging feet he said in a hesitating voice , - "
19224	19273	19094	19094	she	737	" She lifted the wool veil tied round her face , and looked all astonishment . Gabriel and his cold - hearted darling , Bathsheba Everdene , were face to face . Bathsheba did not speak , and he mechanically repeated in an abashed and sad voice , - "
19282	19353	19094	19094	she	737	" CHAPTER VII RECOGNITION - A TIMID GIRL BATHSHEBA withdrew into the shade . She scarcely knew whether most to be amused at the singularity of the meeting , or to be concerned at its awkwardness . There was room for a little pity , also for a very little exultation : the former at his position , the latter at her own . Embarrassed she was not , and she "
19373	19376	19377	19377	she	712	" Yes , "
19399	19409	19377	19377	she	712	" I do want a shepherd . But - - "
19410	19419	19421	19424	one of the villagers	748	" He 's the very man , ma'am . "
19432	19440	19442	19443	a second	750	" Ay , that ' a is . "
19447	19453	19455	19456	a third	751	" The man , truly ! "
19461	19462	19455	19456	a third	751	" "
19468	19475	19455	19456	a third	751	" said number four , fervidly . "
19491	19561	19562	19562	Men	474	" was practical again now . A summer eve and loneliness would have been necessary to give the meeting its proper fulness of romance . the palpitation within his breast at discovering that this Ashtoreth of strange report was only a modification of Venus the well - known and admired , retired with him to talk over the necessary preliminaries of hiring . The fire before them wasted away . "
19564	19568	19478	19478	you	752	" said Bathsheba , "
19587	19588	19581	19581	you	474	" "
19616	19653	19581	19581	you	474	" replied the spokesman . Bathsheba then rode off into the darkness , and the men straggled on to the village in twos and threes - Oak and the bailiff being left by the rick alone . "
19657	19664	19581	19581	you	474	" said the bailiff , finally , "
19692	19693	19690	19690	shepherd	3738	" "
19701	19705	19695	19695	you	757	" inquired Gabriel . "
19713	19737	19707	19707	I	0	" he said , moving past Oak as a Christian edges past an offertory - plate when he does not mean to contribute . "
19784	20001	19782	19782	shepherd	3738	" The bailiff who showed this nervous dread of loving his neighbour as himself , went up the hill , and Oak walked on to the village , still astonished at the ren- counter with Bathsheba , glad of his nearness to her , and perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl of Norcombe had developed into the supervising and cool woman here . But some women only require an emerg- ency to make them fit for one . Obliged , to some extent , to forgo dreaming in order to find the way , he reached the churchyard , and passed round it under the wall where several ancient trees grew . There was a wide margin of grass along here , and Gabriel 's footsteps were deadened by its softness , even at this indurating period of the year . When abreast of a trunk which appeared to be the oldest of the old , he became aware that a figure was standing behind it . Gabriel did not pause in his walk , and in another moment he accidentally kicked a loose stone . The noise was enough to disturb the motionless stranger , who started and assumed a careless position . It was a slim girl , rather thinly clad . "
20008	20014	19782	19782	shepherd	3738	" said Gabriel , heartily . "
20019	20034	19782	19782	shepherd	3738	" said the girl to Gabriel . The voice was unexpectedly attractive ; it was "
20044	20053	19782	19782	shepherd	3738	" common in descriptions , rare in experience . "
20072	20090	20057	20057	you	764	" Gabriel resumed , primarily to gain the information , indirectly to get more of the music . "
20109	20119	20105	20105	you	764	" The girl hesitated and then went on again . "
20134	20137	20105	20105	you	764	" She seemed "
20155	20182	20147	20147	Gabriel	144	" I do n't know where the Buck 's Head is , or anything about it . Do you think of going there to - night ? "
20183	20187	20188	20189	The woman	3527	" Yes - - "
20239	20247	20248	20248	she	3527	" You are not a Weatherbury man ? "
20253	20267	20248	20248	she	3527	" I am not . I am the new shepherd - just arrived . "
20268	20283	20207	20207	she	3527	" Only a shepherd - and you seem almost a farmer by your ways . "
20284	20289	20290	20290	Gabriel	144	" Only a shepherd . "
20300	20349	20290	20290	Gabriel	144	" His thoughts were directed to the past , his eyes to the feet of the girl ; and for the first time he saw lying there a bundle of some sort . She may have perceived the direction of his face , for she said coaxingly , - "
20377	20378	20365	20365	you	144	" "
20389	20393	20365	20365	you	144	" said Oak . "
20399	20404	20395	20395	you	144	" the other replied . "I
20421	20429	20430	20430	You	144	" Then she was silent and shivered . "
20442	20446	20430	20430	You	144	" Gabriel observed . "
20456	20457	20447	20447	I	0	" "
20481	20482	20470	20470	I	0	" "
20488	20496	20470	20470	I	0	" he said ; adding hesitatingly , - "
20529	20530	20533	20533	I	0	" "
20538	20644	20533	20533	I	0	" said the stranger , gratefully . She extended her hand ; Gabriel his . In feeling for each other 's palm in the gloom before the money could be passed , a minute incident occurred which told much . Gabriel 's fingers alighted on the young woman 's wrist . It was beating with a throb of tragic intensity . He had frequently felt the same quick , hard beat in the femoral artery of - his lambs when overdriven . It suggested a consumption too great of a vitality which , to judge from her figure and stature , was already too little . "
20650	20651	20533	20533	I	0	" "
20654	20655	20533	20533	I	0	" "
20660	20661	20533	20533	I	0	" "
20677	20678	20669	20669	your	144	" "
20691	20692	20533	20533	I	0	" "
20697	21202	20533	20533	I	0	" The young girl remained motionless by the tree , and Gabriel descended into the village of Weatherbury , or Lower Longpuddle as it was sometimes called . He fancied that he had felt himself in the penumbra of a very deep sadness when touching that slight and fragile creature . But wisdom lies in moderating mere impres- sions , and Gabriel endeavoured to think little of this . CHAPTER VIII THE MALTHOUSE - THE CHAT - NEWS WARREN 'S Malthouse was enclosed by an old wall inwrapped with ivy , and though not much of the exterior was visible at this hour , the character and purposes of the building were clearly enough shown by its outline upon the sky . From the walls an overhanging thatched roof sloped up to a point in the centre , upon which rose a small wooden lantern , fitted with louvre - boards on all the four sides , and from these openings a mist was dimly perceived to be escaping into the night air . There was no window in front ; but a square hole in the door was glazed with a single pane , through which red , comfortable rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front . Voices were to be heard inside . Oak 's hand skimmed the surface of the door with fingers extended to an Elymas - the - Somerer pattern , till he found a leathern strap , which he pulled . This lifted a wooden latch , and the door swung open . The room inside was lighted only by the , ruddy glow from the kiln mouth , which shone over , the floor with the streaming , horizontality of the setting sun , and threw upwards the shadows of all facial irregularities in those assembled around . The stone - flag floor was worn into a path from the doorway to the kiln , and into undula- tions everywhere . A curved settle of unplaned oak stretched along one side , and in a remote corner was a small bed and bedstead , the owner and frequent occupier of which was the maltster . This aged man was now sitting opposite the fire , his frosty white hair and beard overgrowing his gnarled figure like the grey moss and lichen upon a leafless apple - tree . He wore breeches and the laced - up shoes called ankle - jacks ; he kept his eyes fixed upon the fire . Gabriel 's nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden with the sweet smell of new malt . The conversation which seemed to have been concerning the origin of the fire immediately ceased , and every one ocularly criticised him to the degree expressed by contracting the flesh of their foreheads and looking at him with narrowed eye- lids , as if he had been a light too strong for their sight . Several exclaimed meditatively , after this operation had been completed : - "
21215	21216	21207	21209	the new shepherd	3819	" "
21244	21248	21277	21277	neighbours	776	" said another . "
21267	21268	21269	21270	Gabriel Oak	144	" "
21279	21302	21269	21270	Gabriel Oak	144	" The ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned up this - his turning being as the turning of a rusty crane . "
21317	21337	21338	21338	My	0	" he said , as a formula expressive of surprise , which nobody was supposed to take literally ' . "
21352	21359	21344	21350	old men of the name of Gabriel	780	" said the shepherd , placidly . "
21391	21392	21393	21393	I	0	" "
21400	21405	21393	21393	I	0	" said Mr. Oak . "
21414	21437	21442	21442	you	0	" continued the maltster , the words coming forth of their own accord as if the momentum previously imparted had been sufficient . "
21444	21445	21442	21442	you	0	" "
21450	21451	21453	21453	her	784	" "
21456	21457	21460	21461	yer father	785	" "
21492	21493	21490	21490	Jacob	187	" "
21498	21544	21490	21490	Jacob	187	" said his son , a young man about sixty- five , with a semi - bald head and one tooth in the left centre of his upper jaw , which made much of itself by standing prominent , like a milestone in a bank . "
21546	21581	21490	21490	Jacob	187	" twas Joe had most to do with him . However , my son William must have knowed the very man afore us - did n't ye , Billy , afore ye left Norcombe ? "
21582	21589	21591	21591	Jacob	187	" No , ' twas Andrew . "
21630	21636	21638	21638	Oak	146	" I can mind Andrew . "
21640	21655	21638	21638	Oak	146	" as being a man in the place when I was quite a child . "
21656	21678	21680	21680	Billy	176	" Ay - the other day I and my youngest daughter , Liddy , were over at my grandson 's christening . "
21682	21692	21680	21680	Billy	176	" We were talking about this very family , and "
21749	21750	21753	21753	shepherd	3738	" "
21777	21805	21814	21814	Jacob	187	" said the maltster , removing from the fire his eyes , which were vermilion - red and bleared by gazing into it for so many years . "
21824	22050	21822	21822	Jacob	187	" Jacob stooped to the God - forgive - me , which was a two - handled tall mug standing in the ashes , cracked and charred with heat : it was rather furred with ex- traneous matter about the outside , especially in the crevices of the handles , the innermost curves of which may not have seen daylight for several years by reason of this encrustation thereon - formed of ashes accident- ally wetted with cider and baked hard ; but to the mind of any sensible drinker the cup was no worse for that , being incontestably clean on the inside and about the rim . It may be observed that such a class of mug is called a God - forgive - me in Weatherbury and its vicinity for uncertain reasons ; probably because its size makes any given toper feel ashamed of himself when he sees its bottom in drinking it empty . Jacob , on receiving the order to see if the liquor was warm enough , placidly dipped his forefinger into it by way of thermometer , and having pronounced it nearly of the proper degree , raised the cup and very civilly attempted to dust some of the ashes from the bottom with the skirt of his smock - frock , because Shepherd Oak was a stranger . "
22058	22064	22055	22056	the shepherd	528	" said the maltster commandingly . "
22071	22082	22083	22083	I	0	" said Gabriel , in a reproving tone of considerateness . "
22102	22154	22156	22156	Oak	144	" Taking the mug he drank an inch or more from the depth of its contents , and duly passed it to the next man . would n't think of giving such trouble to neighbours in washing up when there 's so much work to be done in the world already . "
22178	22184	22186	22186	Jacob	187	" A right sensible man . "
22188	22199	22201	22204	a brisk young man	804	" True , true ; it ca n't be gainsaid ! "
22247	22340	22354	22354	Oak	144	" And here 's a mouthful of bread and bacon that mis'ess have sent , shepherd . The cider will go down better with a bit of victuals . Do n't ye chaw quite close , shepherd , for I let the bacon fall in the road outside as I was bringing it along , and may be ' tis rather gritty . There , ' tis clane dirt ; and we all know what that is , as you say , and you bain't a particular man we see , shepherd . "
22341	22350	22354	22354	Oak	144	" True , true - not at all . "
22356	22387	22354	22354	Oak	144	" Do n't let your teeth quite meet , and you wo n't feel the sandiness at all . Ah ! ' tis wonderful what can be done by contrivance ! "
22388	22396	22354	22354	Oak	144	" My own mind exactly , neighbour . "
22397	22419	22421	22422	the maltster	3839	" Ah , he 's his grandfer 's own grandson ! - his grandfer were just such a nice unparticular man ! "
22424	22432	22435	22436	Jan Coggan	180	" Drink , Henry Fray - drink . "
22551	22553	22546	22546	He	193	" Henery "

22712	22728	22730	22730	Jan.	198	" Come , Mark Clark - come . Ther 's plenty more in the barrel . "
22731	22744	22746	22747	Mr. Clark	178	" Ay - that I will , ' tis my only doctor . "
22777	22789	22791	22792	Mr. Coggan	180	" Why , Joseph Poorgrass , ye han't had a drop ! "
22809	22818	22820	22821	Jacob Smallbury	187	" Such a modest man as he is ! "
22823	22848	22820	22821	Jacob Smallbury	187	" Why , ye've hardly had strength of eye enough to look in our young mis'ess 's face , so I hear , Joseph ? "
22858	22870	22872	22872	Joseph	196	" No - I 've hardly looked at her at all . "
22890	22905	22872	22872	Joseph	196	" And when I seed her , ' twas nothing but blushes with me ! "
22906	22910	22912	22913	Mr. Clark	178	" Poor feller . "
22915	22925	22927	22928	Jan Coggan	180	" ' Tis a curious nature for a man . "
22930	22933	22935	22936	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" Yes . "
22965	22988	22935	22936	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" ' Twere blush , blush , blush with me every minute of the time , when she was speaking to me . "
22989	23009	22935	22936	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" I believe ye , Joseph Poorgrass , for we all know ye to be a very bashful man . "
23010	23024	23026	23027	the maltster	3839	" ' Tis a ' awkward gift for a man , poor soul . "
23029	23043	23026	23027	the maltster	3839	" And ye have suffered from it a long time , we know . "
23044	23071	22935	22936	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" Ay ever since I was a boy . Yes - mother was concerned to her heart about it - yes . But twas all nought . "
23072	23089	23026	23027	the maltster	3839	" Did ye ever go into the world to try and stop it , Joseph Poorgrass ? "
23090	23248	23026	23027	the maltster	3839	" Oh ay , tried all sorts o ' company . They took me to Greenhill Fair , and into a great gay jerry - go - nimble show , where there were women - folk riding round - standing upon horses , with hardly anything on but their smocks ; but it did n't cure me a morsel . And then I was put errand - man at the Women 's Skittle Alley at the back of the Tailor 's Arms in Casterbridge . ' Twas a horrible sinful situation , and a very curious place for a good man . I had to stand and look ba'dy people in the face from morning till night ; but ' twas no use - I was just as - bad as ever after all . Blushes hev been in the family for generations . There , ' tis a happy pro- vidence that I be no worse . "
23249	23252	23254	23255	Jacob Smallbury	187	" True . "
23268	23333	23254	23255	Jacob Smallbury	187	" ' Tis a thought to look at , that ye might have been worse ; but even as you be , ' tis a very bad affliction for ' ee , Joseph . For ye see , shepherd , though ' tis very well for a woman , dang it all , ' tis awkward for a man like him , poor feller ? "
23334	23341	23343	23343	Gabriel	144	" ' Tis - ' tis . "
23351	23360	23343	23343	Gabriel	144	" Yes , very awkward for the man . "
23361	23372	23374	23375	Jan Coggan	180	" Ay , and he 's very timid , too . "
23377	23418	23374	23375	Jan Coggan	180	" Once he had been working late at Yalbury Bottom , and had had a drap of drink , and lost his way as he was coming home - along through Yalbury Wood , did n't ye , Master Poorgrass ? "
23419	23430	23432	23434	the modest man	822	" No , no , no ; not that story ! "
23444	23455	23457	23458	Mr Coggan	180	" - - And so ' a lost himself quite . "
23486	23521	23522	23522	Man	3450	" And as he was coming along in the middle of the night , much afeared , and not able to find his way out of the trees nohow , ' a cried out , "
23534	23544	23522	23522	Man	3450	" A owl in a tree happened to be crying "
23551	23560	23561	23561	Gabriel	144	" as owls do , you know , shepherd "
23564	23575	23561	23561	Gabriel	144	" and Joseph , all in a tremble , said , "
23584	23585	23582	23582	sir	3717	" "
23597	23614	23582	23582	sir	3717	" said the timid man , becoming a man of brazen courage all of a sudden . "
23630	23639	23626	23626	I	0	" Joseph Poorgrass o ' Weatherbury , sir . "
23681	23688	23701	23701	ha	831	" Joseph Poor- grass of Weatherbury , "
23730	23750	23752	23752	he	832	" The question of which was right being tacitly waived by the company , Jan went on meditatively : - "
23782	23783	23784	23784	I	0	" "
23787	23811	23784	23784	I	0	" replied Poorgrass , as if there were some conditions too serious even for modesty to remember itself under , this being one . "
23850	23851	23846	23846	he	832	" "
23854	23883	23846	23846	he	832	" said Joseph , acquiring confidence from the warmth of the fire , the cider , and a perception of the narrative capabilities of the experience alluded to . "
24010	24075	24000	24000	neighbours	776	" A meditation on the obvious inference was indulged in by all , and during its continuance each directed his vision into the ashpit , which glowed like a desert in the tropics under a vertical sun , shaping their eyes long and liny , partly because of the light , partly from the depth of the subject discussed . Gabriel broke the silence . "
24099	24123	24124	24124	We	840	" Gabriel 's bosom thrilled gently as he thus slipped under the notice of the assembly the inner- most subject of his heart . "
24183	24195	24197	24198	Jan uncle	845	" That 's about the shape o't , ' a b'lieve . "
24245	24246	24233	24233	ye	847	" "

24398	24403	24391	24392	Master Coggan	180	" corroborated Mark Clark . "
24489	24490	24480	24480	You	187	" "
24497	24501	24494	24494	I	0	" said Jacob . "

24652	24656	24650	24650	Charlotte	200	" continued Coggan - "
24721	24722	24718	24719	poor soul	3892	" "
24736	24754	24757	24757	them	875	" inquired the shepherd , who found some difficulty in keeping the conversation in the desired channel . "
24761	24766	24757	24757	them	875	" said Jacob Smallbury ; "
24798	24799	24796	24796	mother	3894	" "
24802	24807	24808	24808	he	873	" said the maltster , "

24852	24856	24823	24823	He	873	" observed Coggan . "
24877	24882	24857	24857	He	873	" said the maltster . "
24885	24889	24857	24857	He	873	" said Coggan . "
24911	24912	24896	24896	he	873	" "
24926	24943	24967	24967	woman	473	" murmered Joseph Poorgrass , who habitually spoke on a large scale in his moral reflections . "
24950	24954	24967	24967	woman	473	" said Gabriel . "
24983	24986	24971	24972	Levi Everdene	205	" Man . "

25043	25047	25036	25036	he	726	" said Joseph . "
25067	25105	25053	25054	That man	892	" The maltster being rather short of breath , Mr. Coggan , after absently scrutinising a coal which had fallen among the ashes , took up the narrative , with a private twirl of his eye : - "
25181	25184	25185	25185	he	726	" Coggan , "
25188	25226	25185	25185	he	726	" I could never wish for a handsomer woman than I 've got , but feeling she 's ticketed as my lawful wife , I ca n't help my wicked heart wandering , do what I will . "
25322	25323	25301	25301	a	901	" "
25333	25338	25301	25301	a	901	" murmured Joseph Poorgrass ; "
25387	25388	25389	25389	You	0	" "
25392	25397	25389	25389	You	0	" said Billy Smallbury , "

25442	25448	25449	25449	He	726	" said Joseph Poor- grass . "

25571	25572	25536	25536	he	726	" "

25635	25649	25651	25652	Henery Fray	195	" Their daughter was not at all a pretty chile at that time . "
25654	25673	25651	25652	Henery Fray	195	" Never should have . thought she 'd have growed up such a handsome body as she is . "
25674	25689	25594	25595	Parson Thirdly	206	" ' Tis to be hoped her temper is as good as her face . "
25690	25711	25712	25712	Henery	195	" Well , yes ; but the baily will have most to do with the business and ourselves . Ah ! "
25725	25739	25712	25712	Henery	195	" A queer Christian , like the Devil 's head in a cowl , "
25743	25757	25740	25740	He	726	" said Henery , implying that irony must cease at a certain point . "

25804	25862	25863	25863	Gabriel	144	" said the man of bitter moods , looking round upon the company with the antithetic laughter that comes from a keener appreciation of the miseries of life than ordinary men are capable of . ' Ah , there 's people of one sort , and people of another , but that man - bless your souls ! "
25871	25889	25890	25890	he	144	" You must be a very aged man , malter , to have sons growed mild and ancient "
25893	25912	25914	25914	Jacob	187	" Father 's so old that ' a ca n't mind his age , can ye , father ? "
25916	25925	25926	25926	Jacob	187	" And he growled terrible crooked too , lately "
25944	25957	25926	25926	Jacob	187	" Really one may say that father there is three - double . "
25958	25967	25969	25970	the maltster	3839	" Crooked folk will last a long while . "
25981	26001	25969	25970	the maltster	3839	" Shepherd would like to hear the pedigree of yer life , father - would n't ye , shepherd ? "
26007	26026	25969	25970	the maltster	3839	" said Gabriel with the heartiness of a man who had longed to hear it for several months . "
26035	26088	26033	26033	malter	3939	" The maltster cleared his throat in an exaggerated form for emphasis , and elongating his gaze to the remotest point of the ashpit ! said , in the slow speech justifiable when the importance of a subject is so generally felt that any mannerism must be tolerated in getting at it , "

26146	26151	26141	26141	I	0	" nodding to the east "
26209	26218	26207	26208	Master Oak	146	" Oak smiled sincere belief in the fact . "
26247	26257	26258	26259	Old Twills	209	" nodding north - west - by - north . "
26316	26317	26402	26403	both halves	924	" "
26322	26346	26402	26403	both halves	924	" chuckled another old gentleman , given to mental arithmetic and little con- versation , who had hitherto sat unobserved in a corner . "
26356	26364	26402	26403	both halves	924	" said the maltster , em- phatically . "
26370	26374	26368	26368	father	873	" said Jacob . "
26406	26407	26404	26404	father	873	" "

26450	26456	26430	26430	ye'll	926	" said Gabriel , soothingly . "
26467	26490	26465	26465	malter	3939	" attested Jan must have a wonderful talented constitution to be able to live so long , must n't he , neighbours ? "
26491	26503	26509	26510	The maltster	3839	" True , true ; ye must , malter , wonderful , "
26589	26590	26577	26577	you	144	" "
26594	26601	26591	26591	You	144	" said Gabriel , blushing faintly . "
26631	26632	26623	26623	shepherd	3738	" "
26643	26648	26623	26623	shepherd	3738	" said Jan Coggan . "
26658	26659	26655	26656	Master Oak	146	" "
26664	26677	26655	26656	Master Oak	146	" said Gabriel , pulling out his flute and putting it together . "
26696	26701	26702	26702	Jockey	210	" Oak then struck up "
26707	26746	26702	26702	Jockey	210	" and played that sparkling melody three times through accenting the notes in the third round in a most artistic and lively manner by bending his body in small jerks and tapping with his foot to beat time . "
26760	26776	26747	26747	He	146	" said a young married man , who having no individuality worth mentioning was known as "
26782	26786	26777	26778	Susan Tall	211	" He continued , "
26806	26807	26808	26808	He	146	" "
26828	26838	26839	26839	We	937	" murmured Joseph Poorgrass , in a soft cadence . "
26903	26915	26901	26902	our wives	943	" and daughters ' sakes we should feel real thanks giving . "
26916	26925	26928	26929	Mark Clark	178	" True , true , - real thanksgiving ! "
26962	26965	26967	26967	Joseph	196	" Yes . "
26979	27019	26967	26967	Joseph	196	" for evil do thrive so in these times that ye may be as much deceived in the cleanest shaved and whitest shirted man as in the raggedest tramp upon the turnpike , if I may term it so . "
27020	27032	27034	27035	Henery Fray	195	" Ay , I can mind yer face now , shepherd . "
27050	27102	27034	27035	Henery Fray	195	" Yes - now I see ' ee blowing into the flute I know ' ee to be the same man I see play at Casterbridge , for yer mouth were scrimped up and yer eyes a - staring out like a strangled man 's - just as they be now . "
27103	27121	27123	27125	Mr. Mark Clark	178	" ' Tis a pity that playing the flute should make a man look such a scarecrow . "
27153	27157	27135	27137	the latter person	945	" Dame Durden ! "
27175	27181	27160	27160	you	144	" whispered Joseph to Gabriel . "
27186	27191	27160	27160	you	144	" said Mr. Oak . "
27204	27213	27202	27202	shepherd	3738	" continued Joseph Poorgrass , with winning sauvity . "
27222	27227	27220	27220	shepard	949	" said the company . "
27233	27281	27229	27229	you	144	" said Oak , in the modest tone good manners demanded , thinking , however , that he would never let Bathsheba see him playing the flute ; in this severe showing a discretion equal to that related to its sagacious inventress , the divine Minerva herself . "
27295	27311	27285	27285	I	0	" said the old maltster , not pleased at finding himself left out of the subject "
27326	27327	27322	27322	everybody	954	" "
27337	27385	27330	27330	ye	0	" said a voice with the vigour natural to the enunciation of a remark- ably evident truism . It came from the old man in the background , whose offensiveness and spiteful ways were barely atoned for by the occasional chuckle he con- tributed to general laughs . "
27391	27395	27330	27330	ye	0	" said Gabriel . "
27403	27420	27421	27421	I	0	" said Susan Tall 's husband , the young married man who had spoken once before . "
27466	27467	27458	27458	I	0	" "
27476	27480	27474	27474	Laban	213	" inquired Coggan . "
27491	27492	27481	27481	You	0	" "
27521	27528	27509	27509	she	459	" The young man hated lamely . "
27542	27546	27539	27539	I	0	" remarked Coggan . "
27557	27674	27539	27539	I	0	" said Susan Tall 's husband , in a tone intended to imply his habitual reception of jokes without minding them at all . The young man then wished them good - night and withdrew . Henery Fray was the first to follow . Then Gabriel arose and went off with Jan Coggan , who had offered him a lodging . A few minutes later , when the remaining ones were on their legs and about to depart , Fray came back again in a hurry . Flourishing his finger ominously he threw a gaze teeming with tidings just - where his eye alighted by accident , which happened to be in Joseph Poorgrass 's face . "
27689	27696	27687	27687	Henery	195	" said Joseph , starting back . "
27705	27712	27713	27714	Baily Pennyways	216	" asked Jacob and Mark Clark . "
27729	27730	27725	27725	I	0	" "
27738	27739	27725	27725	I	0	" "

27879	27934	27936	27936	ye	962	" The question was such a profound one that Henery was obliged to drink there and then from the large cup till the bottom was distinctly visible inside . Before he had replaced it on the table , in came the young man , Susan Tall 's husband , in a still greater hurry . "
27946	27947	27936	27936	ye	962	" "
27952	27953	27936	27936	ye	962	" "

27968	27993	27936	27936	ye	962	" they replied , looking into the very midst of Laban Tall as if to meet his words half - way down his throat . "
28000	28011	27936	27936	ye	962	" murmured Joseph Poor- grass , waving his hands spasmodically . "

28146	28155	28123	28124	a crowner	968	" came from Joseph Poorgrass 's dry lips . "
28162	28166	28123	28124	a crowner	968	" said Tall . "
28175	28187	28190	28191	Miss Everdene	167	" suggested Billy Smallbury , with a vivid sense of detail . "
28226	28313	28330	28330	ma'am	712	" They all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse , excepting the old maltster , whom neither news , fire , rain , nor thunder could draw from his hole . There , as the others ' footsteps died away he sat down again and continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his red , bleared eyes . From the bedroom window above their heads Bath- sheba 's head and shoulders , robed in mystic white , were dimly seen extended into the air . "
28322	28327	28317	28318	my men	974	" she said anxiously . "
28334	28341	28317	28318	my men	974	" said Susan Tall 's husband . "
28394	28395	28382	28382	She	979	" "
28416	28421	28404	28406	any young man	981	" asked Jacob Smallbury . "
28427	28431	28404	28406	any young man	981	" said Bathsheba . "
28443	28449	28432	28432	I	0	" said two or three . "
28457	28461	28432	28432	I	0	" continued Bathsheba . "
28527	28528	28513	28513	Maryann	179	" "
28555	28567	28533	28533	ma'am	712	" said Jacob , turning his mental vision upon past experiences . "
28578	28579	28580	28580	She	979	" "
28597	28612	28580	28580	She	979	" said a female voice from another window , which seemed that of Maryann . "
28635	28636	28630	28630	he	991	" "
28643	28647	28638	28638	you	0	" Bathsheba said . "
28659	28660	28652	28652	she	979	" "
28676	28681	28652	28652	she	979	" said William Smallbury . "
28762	28787	28754	28754	I	0	" Bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that it seemed she did not think it worth while to dwell upon any particular one . "
28795	28805	28754	28754	I	0	" she said in conclusion , closing the casement . "
28815	29756	28754	28754	I	0	" they replied , and moved away . That night at Coggan 's , Gabriel Oak , beneath the screen of closed eyelids , was busy with fancies , and full of movement , like a river flowing rapidly under its ice . Night had always been the time at which he saw Bath- sheba most vividly , and through the slow hours of shadow he tenderly regarded her image now . It is rarely that the pleasures of the imagination will compen- sate for the pain of sleeplessness , but they possibly did with Oak to - night , for the delight of merely seeing her effaced for the time his perception of the great differ- ence between seeing and possessing . He also thought of Plans for fetching his few utensils and books from Norcombe . The Young Man 's Best Companion , The Farrier 's Sure Guide , The Veterinary Surgeon , Paradise Lost , The Pilgrim 's Progress , Robinson Crusoe , Ash 's Dictionary , the Walkingame 's Arithmetic , constituted his library ; and though a limited series , it was one from which he had acquired more sound informa- tion by diligent perusal than many a man of opportunities has done from a furlong of laden shelves . CHAPTER IX THE HOMESTEAD - A VISITOR - HALF - CONFIDENCES By daylight , the Bower of Oak 's new - found mistress , Bathsheba Everdene , presented itself as a hoary build- ing , of the early stage of Classic Renaissance as regards its architecture , and of ' a proportion which told at a glance that , as is so frequently the case , it had once been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it , now altogether effaced as a distinct property , and merged in the vast tract of a non - resident landlord , which com- prised several such modest demesnes . Fluted pilasters , worked from the solid stone , decorated its front , and above the roof the chimneys were panelled or columnar , some coped gables with finials and like features still retaining traces of their Gothic extraction . Soft Brown mosses , like faded velveteen , formed cushions upon the stone tiling , and tufts of the houseleek or sengreen sprouted from the eaves of the low surrounding buildings . A gravel walk leading from the door to the road in front was encrusted at the sides with more moss - here it was a silver - green variety , the nut - brown of the gravel being visible to the width of only a foot or two in the centre . This circum- stance , and the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect here , together with the animated and contrasting state of the reverse facade , suggested to the imagination that on the adaptation of the building for farming purposes the vital principle ' of the house had turned round inside its body to face the other way . Reversals of this kind , strange deformities , tremendous paralyses , are often seen to be inflicted by trade upon edifices - either individual or in the aggregate as streets and towns - which were originally planned for pleasure alone . Lively voices were heard this morning in the upper rooms , the main staircase to which was of hard oak , the balusters , heavy as bed - posts , being turned and moulded in the quaint fashion of their century , the handrail as stout as a parapet - top , and the stairs themselves con- tinually twisting round like a person trying to look over his shoulder . Going up , the floors above were found to have a very irregular surface , rising to ridges , sinking into valley ; and being just then uncarpeted , the face of the boards was seen to be eaten into innumerable the opening and shutting of every door a tremble followed every bustling movement , and a creak accom- panied a walker about the house like a spirit , wherever- he went . In the room from which the conversation proceeded , Bathsheba and her servant - companion , Liddy Small- bury were to be discovered sitting upon the floor , and sorting a complication of papers , books , bottles , and rubbish spread out thereon - remnants from the house- hold stores of the late occupier . Liddy , the maltster 's great - granddaughter , was about Bathsheba 's equal in age , and her face was a prominent advertisement of the features ' might have lacked in form was amply made up for by perfection of hue , which at this winter - time was the softened ruddiness on a surface of high rotundity and , like the presentations of those great colourists , it was a face which kept well back from the boundary between comeliness and the ideal . Though elastic in nature she was less daring than Bathsheba , and occa- sionally showed some earnestness , which consisted half of genuine feeling , and half of mannerliness superadded by way of duty . Through a partly - opened door the noise of a scrubbing- brush led up to the charwoman , Maryann Money , a person who for a face had a circular disc , furrowed less by age than by long gazes of perplexity at distant objects . To think of her was to get good - humoured ; to speak of her was to raise the image of a dried Normandy pippin . "
29763	29772	28754	28754	I	0	" said Bathsheba through the door to her . "
29777	29838	29773	29773	I	0	" Maryann suspended the brush . The tramp of a horse was apparent , approaching the front of the building . The paces slackened , turned in at the wicket , and , what was most unusual , came up the mossy path close to the door . The door was tapped with the end of a crop or stick . "
29842	29851	29773	29773	I	0	" said Liddy , in a low voice . "
29884	29885	29881	29881	his	1003	" "
29889	29909	29881	29881	his	1003	" said Bathsheba . The further expression of Liddy 's concern was con- tinued by aspect instead of narrative . "
29920	29942	29913	29914	Mrs. Coggan	223	" Bath- sheba continued . Rat - tat - tat - tat , resounded more decisively from Bath- sheba 's oak . "
29948	29963	29943	29943	Maryann	179	" said she , fluttering under the onset of a crowd of romantic possibilities . "
29974	29985	29943	29943	Maryann	179	" The argument was unanswerable after a glance at Maryann . "
29991	30021	29986	29986	Liddy	191	" said Bathsheba . Liddy held up her hands and arms , coated with dust from the rubbish they were sorting , and looked implor- ingly at her mistress . "
30029	30064	30024	30025	Mrs. Coggan	223	" said Bathsheba , exhaling her relief in the form of a long breath which had lain in her bosom a minute or more . The door opened , and a deep voice said - "
30071	30072	30073	30073	I	0	" "
30079	30093	30077	30077	sir	3717	" said Mrs. Coggan , and in a minute appeared in the room . "
30104	30164	30094	30094	Dear	1008	" con- tinued Mrs. Coggan a wholesome - looking lady who had a voice for each class of remark according to the emotion involved ; who could toss a pancake or twirl a mop with the accuracy of pure mathematics , and who at this moment showed hands shaggy with frag- ments of dough and arms encrusted with flour . "
30238	30253	30233	30233	Bathsheba	243	" I ca n't see him in this state . Whatever shall I do ? "
30270	30285	30267	30267	Liddy	191	" Say you 're a fright with dust , and ca n't come down . "
30286	30294	30296	30297	Mrs. Coggan	223	" Yes - that sounds very well . "
30301	30313	30296	30297	Mrs. Coggan	223	" Say I ca n't see him - that will do . "
30335	30355	30331	30331	her	223	" Miss is dusting bottles , sir , and is quite a object - that 's why ' tis . "
30356	30362	30296	30297	Mrs. Coggan	223	" Oh , very well . "
30368	30371	30296	30297	Mrs. Coggan	223	" indifferently . "
30388	30389	30392	30392	sir	3717	" "
30429	30444	30420	30422	the other men	1019	" The horse 's tramp then recommenced and -retreated , and the door closed . "
30450	30454	30455	30456	A gentleman	600	" said Bathsheba . "
30463	30464	30455	30456	A gentleman	600	" "
30467	30468	30471	30471	miss	1011	" "

30480	30481	30478	30478	he	224	" "
30498	30499	30484	30484	I	0	" "
30517	30523	30507	30507	I	0	" Bathsheba said , complainingly . "
30531	30532	30526	30526	he	224	" "
30579	30580	30575	30575	Lord	1028	" "

30678	30768	30663	30663	Lord	1036	" A little boy came up at this moment and looked in upon them . This child was one of the Coggans who , with the Smallburys , were as common among the families of this district as the Avons and Derwents among our rivers . He always had a loosened tooth or a cut finger to show to particular friends , which he did with an air of being thereby elevated above the common herd of afflictionless humanity - to which exhibition of congratulation as well as pity . "
30777	30786	30769	30769	I	0	" said Master Coggan in a scanning measure . "
30796	30800	30808	30808	He	1038	" said Liddy . "
30818	30819	30808	30808	He	1038	" "
30825	30826	30827	30827	He	1038	" "
30829	30840	30827	30827	He	1038	" Where are you going , my little man ? ' "
30845	30852	30854	30854	he	1038	" To Miss Everdene 's please , "
30857	30872	30854	30854	he	1038	" She is a staid woman , is n't she , my little man ? "
30877	30880	30874	30874	I	0	" Yes . "
30881	30893	30827	30827	He	1038	" You naughty child ! What did you say that for ? "
30894	30902	30874	30874	I	0	" Cause he gave me the penny ! "
30903	30911	30913	30913	Bathsheba	243	" What a pucker everything is in ! "
30943	30944	30947	30947	mistress	996	" "

30994	31005	30986	30986	anybody	3643	" Liddy ventured to ask when they were again alone . "
31008	31015	30986	30986	anybody	3643	" em , i daresay . ? "
31059	31066	31067	31067	she	0	" A man wanted to once . "
31091	31098	31100	31100	Liddy	191	" How nice it must seem ! "
31110	31118	31100	31100	Liddy	191	" And you would n't have him ? "
31119	31129	31166	31166	your	3717	" He was n't quite good enough for me . "
31130	31148	31100	31100	Liddy	191	" How sweet to be able to disdain , when most of us are glad to say , "
31152	31159	31150	31150	you	1039	" I seem I hear it . "
31169	31171	31164	31164	I	0	" or "
31186	31195	31164	31164	I	0	" And did you love him , miss ? "
31196	31207	31164	31164	I	0	" Oh , no . But I rather liked him . "
31208	31213	31164	31164	I	0	" Do you now ? "
31214	31226	31164	31164	I	0	" Of course not - what footsteps are those I hear ? "
31360	31367	31369	31369	Liddy	191	" The Philistines be upon us . "
31379	31411	31369	31369	Liddy	191	" Oh , very well . Maryann , go down and keep them in the kitchen till I am dressed , and then show them in to me in the hall . "
31560	31568	31570	31570	Bathsheba	243	" Now before I begin , men . "
31572	31618	31570	31570	Bathsheba	243	" I have two matters to speak of . The first is that the bailiff is dismissed for thieving , and that I have formed a resolu- tion to have no bailiff at all , but to manage everything with my own head and hands . "
31628	31641	31619	31620	The men	3799	" The next matter is , have you heard anything of Fanny ? "
31642	31647	31619	31620	The men	3799	" Nothing , ma'am . "
31653	31654	31655	31655	I	0	" "
31660	31688	31657	31658	Farmer Boldwood	231	" said Jacob Smallbury , ' and I went with him and two of his men , and dragged New- mill Pond , but we found nothing . "
31689	31716	31718	31719	Laban Tall	213	" And the new shepherd have been to Buck 's Head , by Yalbury , thinking she had gone there , but nobody had seed her . "
31721	31730	31718	31719	Laban Tall	213	" Has n't William Smallbury been to Casterbridge ? "
31731	31752	31657	31658	Farmer Boldwood	231	" Yes , ma'am , but he 's not yet come home . He promised to be back by six . "
31753	31763	31769	31769	her	1059	" It wants a quarter to six at present . "
31772	31785	31787	31787	she	1059	" I daresay he 'll be in directly . Well , now then "
31793	31801	31787	31787	she	1059	" Joseph Poorgrass , are you there ? "
31802	31811	31813	31814	the person	3613	" Yes , sir - ma'am I mane . "
31817	31826	31813	31814	the person	3613	" I be the personal name of Poorgrass . "
31827	31833	31657	31658	Farmer Boldwood	231	" And what are you ? "
31834	31862	31787	31787	she	1059	" Nothing in my own eye . In the eye of other people - well , I do n't say it ; though public thought will out . "
31863	31872	31813	31814	the person	3613	" What do you do on the farm ? "
31873	31903	31657	31658	Farmer Boldwood	231	" I do do carting things all the year , and in seed time I shoots the rooks and sparrows , and helps at pig - killing , sir . "
31904	31910	31787	31787	she	1059	" How much to you ? "
31911	31933	31813	31814	the person	3613	" Please nine and ninepence and a good halfpenny where ' twas a bad one , sir - ma'am I mane . "
31934	31958	31657	31658	Farmer Boldwood	231	" Quite correct . Now here are ten shillings in addi- tion as a small present , as I am a new comer . "
31996	32015	32017	32017	Bathsheba	243	" How much do I owe you - that man in the corner - what 's your name ? "
32019	32025	32017	32017	Bathsheba	243	" Matthew Moon , ma'am . "
32062	32080	32082	32084	the young farmer	1063	" Matthew Mark , did you say ? - speak out - I shall not hurt you . "

32164	32197	32153	32153	Matthew	181	" Here it is and ten shillings . Now -the next - Andrew Randle , you are a new man , I hear . How come you to leave your last farm ? "
32198	32253	32122	32122	her	1061	" P - p - p - p - p - pl - pl - pl - pl - l - l - l - l - ease , ma'am , p - p - p - p - pl - pl- pl - pl - please , ma'am - please'm - please'm - - "

32272	32303	32266	32267	Henery Fray	195	" and they turned him away because the only time he ever did speak plain he said his soul was his own , and other iniquities , to the squire . "

32558	32565	32556	32556	ma'am	712	" replied the young married man . "
32573	32590	32591	32592	What woman	1076	" said a woman in the back quarter , who had just entered with clicking pattens . "
32596	32600	32591	32592	What woman	1076	" Bathsheba asked . "
32607	32668	32591	32592	What woman	1076	" continued the voice with greater prominence of manner and tone . This lady called herself five - and - twenty , looked thirty , passed as thirty - five , and was forty . She was a woman who never , like some newly married , showed conjugal tenderness in public , perhaps because she had none to show . "
32674	32678	32591	32592	What woman	1076	" said Bathsheba . "

32756	32797	32750	32750	Heh	1082	" laughed the married man with a hideous effort of appreciation , for he was as irrepressibly good - humoured under ghastly snubs as a parliamentary candidate on the hustings . The names remaining were called in the same manner . "

33195	33343	33191	33191	I	0	" Gabriel was rather staggered by the remark- able coolness of her manner . Certainly nobody without previous information would have dreamt that Oak and the handsome woman before whom he stood had ever been other than strangers . But perhaps her air was the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced her from a cottage to a large house and fields . The case is not unexampled in high places . When , in the writings of the later poets , Jove and his family are found to have moved from their cramped quarters on the peak of Olympus into the wide sky above it , their words show a proportionate increase of arrogance and reserve . Footsteps were heard in the passage , combining in their character the qualities both of weight and measure , rather at the expense of velocity . All . "

36281	36818	36848	36848	she	1196	an"arch of it between his two hands , overweighting it on the ground till it reached nearly a semicircle ; or perhaps it was hastily tucked under the arm whilst the sample - bag was pulled forth and a hand- ful of corn poured into the palm , which , after criticism , was flung upon the floor , an issue of events perfectly well known to half - a - dozen acute town - bred fowls which had as usual crept into the building unobserved , and waited the fulfilment of their anticipations with a high- stretched neck and oblique eye . Among these heavy yeomen a feminine figure glided , the single one of her sex that the room contained . She was prettily and even daintily dressed . She moved between them as a chaise between carts , was heard after them as a romance after sermons , was felt among them like a breeze among furnaces . It had required a little determination - far more than she had at first imagined - to take up a position here , for at her first entry the lumbering dialogues had ceased , nearly every face had been turned towards her , and those that were already turned rigidly fixed there . Two or three only of the farmers were personally known to Bathsheba , and to these she had made her way . But if she was to be the practical woman she had intended to show herself , business must be carried on , introductions or none , and she ultimately acquired con- fidence enough to speak and reply boldly to men merely known to her by hearsay . Bathsheba too had her sample - bags , and by degrees adopted the professional pour into the hand - holding up the grains in her narrow palm for inspection , in perfect Casterbridge manner . Something in the exact arch of her upper unbroken row of teeth , and in the keenly pointed corners of her red mouth when , with parted lips , she somewhat defiantly turned up her face to argue a point with a tall man , suggested that there was potentiality enough in that lithe slip of humanity for alarming exploits of sex , and daring enough to carry them out . But her eyes had a softness - invariably a softness - which , had they not been dark , would have seemed mistiness ; as they were , it lowered an expression that might have been piercing to simple clearness , Strange to say of a woman in full bloom and vigor , she always allowed her interlocutors to finish their state- ments before rejoining with hers . In arguing on prices , he held to her own firmly , as was natural in a dealer , and reduced theirs persistently , as was inevitable in a oman . But there was an elasticity in her firmness which removed it from obstinacy , as there was a naivete in her cheapening which saved it from meanness . Those of the farmers with whom she had no dealings by far the greater part were continually asking each other , "
36823	36829	36871	36871	she	1196	" The reply would be - "
36854	36864	36910	36910	she	1196	" The other man would then shake his head . "
36876	36882	37516	37516	I	0	" the first would say . "
36917	37467	37516	37516	I	0	" It would be ungallant to suggest that the novelty of her engagement in such an occupation had almost as much to do with the magnetism as had the beauty of her face and movements . However , the interest was general , and this Saturday 's debut in the forum , whatever it may have been to Bathsheba as the buying and selling farmer , was unquestionably a triumph to her as the maiden . Indeed , the sensation was so pronounced that her instinct on two or three occasions was merely to walk as a queen among these gods of the fallow , like a little sister of a little Jove , and to neglect closing prices altogether . The numerous evidences of - her power to attract were only thrown into greater relief by a marked exception . Women seem to have eyes in their ribbons for such matters as these . Bathsheba , without looking within a right angle of him , was conscious of a black sheep among the flock . It perplexed her first . If there had been a respect- able minority on either side , the case would have been most natural . If nobody had regarded her , she would have - taken the matter indifferently - such cases had occurred . If everybody , this man included , she would have taken it as a matter of course - people had done so before . But the smallness of the exception made the mystery . She soon knew thus much of the recusant 's appear- ance . He was a gentlemanly man , with full and distinctly outlined Roman features , the prominences of which glowed in the sun with a bronze - like richness of tone . He was erect in attitude , and quiet in demeanour . One characteristic pre - eminently marked him - dignity . Apparently he had some time ago reached that entrance to middle age at which a man 's aspect naturally ceases to alter for the term of a dozen years or so ; and , artificially , a woman't does likewise . Thirty - five and fifty were his limits of variation - he might have been either , or anywhere between the two . It may be said that married men of forty are usually ready and generous enough to fling passing glances at any specimen of moderate beauty they may discern by the way . Probably , as with persons playing whist for love , the consciousness of a certain immunity under any circumstances from that worst possible ultimate , the having to pay , makes them unduly speculative . Bathsheba was convinced that this unmoved person was not a married man . When marketing was over , she rushed off to Liddy , who was waiting for her - beside the yellowing in which they had driven to town . The horse was put in , and on they trotted Bathsheba 's sugar , tea , and drapery parcels being packed behind , and expressing in some indescribable manner , by their colour , shape , and general lineaments , that they were that young lady- farmer 's property , and the grocer 's and drapers no more .

The special verse in the Book of Ruth was sought out by Bathsheba , and the sublime words met her eye . They slightly thrilled and abashed her . It was Wisdom in the abstract facing Folly in the concrete . Folly in the concrete blushed , persisted in her intention , and placed the key on -the book . A rusty patch immediately upon the verse , caused by previous pressure of an iron substance thereon , told that this was not the first time the old volume had been used for the purpose . "

39199	39220	39403	39405	the persistent Liddy	191	" What fun it would be to send it to the stupid old Boldwood , and how he would wonder ! "
39375	39393	39423	39424	her mistress	4024	" No , I wo n't do that . He would n't see any humour in it . "
39394	39401	39423	39424	her mistress	4024	" He 'd worry to death . "
39407	39421	39364	39364	Liddy	191	" Really , I do n't care particularly to send it to Teddy . "
39426	39435	39454	39454	Bathsheba	243	" He 's rather a naughty child sometimes . "
39436	39443	39454	39454	Bathsheba	243	" Yes - that he is . "
39444	39452	39364	39364	Liddy	191	" Let 's toss as men do . "
39458	39488	39364	39364	Liddy	191	" Now then , head , Boldwood ; tail , Teddy . No , we wo n't toss money on a Sunday that would be tempting the devil indeed . "
39489	39507	39574	39574	Boldwood	231	" Toss this hymn - book ; there ca n't be no sinfulness in that , miss . "
39508	39538	39689	39689	she	0	" Very well . Open , Boldwood - shut , Teddy . No ; it 's more likely to fall open . Open , Teddy - shut , Boldwood . "
39576	39664	39689	39689	she	0	" Now light a candle , Liddy . Which seal shall we use ? Here 's a unicorn 's head - there 's nothing in that . What 's this ? - two doves - no . It ought to be something extraordinary , ought it not , Liddy ? Here 's one with a motto - I remember it is some funny one , but I ca n't read it . We 'll try this , and if it does n't do we 'll have another . "
39685	39688	39934	39934	their	1242	" Capital ! "
39698	39866	40561	40561	he	231	" ' Twould upset the solemnity of a parson The same evening the letter was sent , and was duly returned to Weatherbury again in the morning . Of love as a spectacle Bathsheba had a fair knowledge ; but of love subjectively she knew nothing . CHAPTER XIV EFFECT OF THE LETTER - SUNRISE AT dusk , on the evening of St. Valentine 's Day , Bold- wood sat down to supper as usual , by a beaming fire of aged logs . Upon the mantel - shelf before him was a time - piece , surmounted by a spread eagle , and upon the eagle 's wings was the letter Bathsheba had sent . Here the bachelor 's gaze was continually fastening itself , till the large red seal became as a blot of blood on the retina of his eye ; and as he ate and drank he still read in fancy the words thereon , although they were too remote for his sight - "
39870	39933	41089	41090	the man	726	" The pert injunction was like those crystal substances which , colourless themselves , assume the tone of objects about them . Here , in the quiet of Boldwood 's parlour , where everything that , was not grave was extraneous , and where the atmosphere was that of a Puritan Sunday lasting all the week , the letter and its dictum changed "
40556	40560	41093	41093	he	726	" Marry me . "
41075	41087	41160	41160	You	231	" I do n't think it is for you , sir . "
41099	41113	41174	41174	I	0	" Though there is no name I think it is for your shepherd . "
41132	41159	41284	41288	the man on the hill	1260	" Oh - what a mistake ! - it is not mine . Nor is it for my shepherd . It is for Miss Everdene 's . "
41180	41274	41290	41290	I	0	" At this moment , on the ridge , up against the blazing sky , a figure was visible , like the black snuff in the midst of a candle - flame . Then it moved and began to bustle about vigorously from place to place , carrying square skeleton masses , which were riddled by the same rays . A small figure on all fours followed behind . The tall form was that of Gabriel Oak ; the small one that of George ; the articles in course of transit were hurdles . "
41277	41281	41652	41652	I	0	" said Boldwood . "
41299	41622	41656	41656	I	0	" To Boldwood it was now no longer merely a letter to I another man . It was an opportunity . Exhibiting a face pregnant with intention , he entered the snowy field . Gabriel , at that minute , descended the hill towards the right . The glow stretched down in this direction now , and touched the distant roof of Warren 's Malthouse whither the shepherd was apparently bent : Boldwood followed at a distance . CHAPTER XV THE scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did not penetrate to its interior , which was , as usual , lighted by a rival glow of similar hue , radiating from the hearth . The maltster , after having lain down in his clothes for a few hours , was now sitting beside a three - legged table , breakfasting of bread and bacon . This was eaten on the plateless system , which is performed by placing a slice of bread upon the table , the meat flat upon the bread , a mustard plaster upon the meat , and a pinch of salt upon the whole , then cutting them vertically downwards with a large pocket - knife till wood is reached , when the severed lamp is impaled on the knife , elevated , and sent the proper way of food . The maltster 's lack of teeth appeared not to sensibly diminish his powers as a mill . He had been without them for so many years that toothlessness was felt less to be a defect than hard gums an acquisition . Indeed , he seemed to approach the grave as a hyperbolic curve approaches a straight line - less directly as he got nearer , till it was doubtful if he would ever reach it at all . In the ashpit was a heap of potatoes roasting , and a boiling pipkin of charred bread , called "
41625	41651	41909	41909	she	1263	" for the benefit of whomsoever should call , for Warren 's was a sort of clubhouse . used as an alternative to the in ! "
41673	41905	41950	41950	She	1263	" was a remark now suddenly heard spreading into the malthouse from the door , which had been opened the previous moment . The form of Henery Fray advanced to the fire , stamping the snow from his boots when about half - way there . The speech and entry had not seemed to be at all an abrupt begin- ning to the maltster , introductory matter being often omitted in this neighbourhood , both from word and deed , and the maltster having the same latitude allowed him , did not hurry to reply . He picked up a fragment of cheese , by pecking upon it with his knife , as a butcher picks up skewers . Henery appeared in a drab kerseymere great - coat , buttoned over his smock - frock , the white skirts of the latter being visible to the distance of about a foot below the coat - tails , which , when you got used to the style of dress , looked natural enough , and even ornamental - it certainly was comfortable . Matthew Moon , Joseph Poorgrass , and other carters and waggoners followed at his heels , with great lanterns dangling from their hands , which showed that they had just come from the cart - horse stables , where they had been busily engaged since four o'clock that morning . "
41916	41949	41987	41987	she	1263	" the maltster inquired . Henery shook his head , and smiled one of the bitter smiles , dragging all the flesh of his forehead into a corrugated heap in the centre . "
41959	41962	42013	42013	my	0	" he said "
41994	42009	42107	42107	she	1270	" He allowed his head to swing laterally three or four times in silence . "
42019	42074	42145	42148	a man in travel	1274	" This was recognized by all as the conclusion of some gloomy speech which had been expressed in thought alone during the shake of the head ; Henery meanwhile retained several marks of despair upon his face , to imply that they would be required for use again directly he should go on speaking . "
42094	42099	42162	42162	ye	195	" said Mark Clark . "
42150	42151	42220	42220	She	1270	" "
42164	42185	42241	42241	I	0	" said Joseph Poorgrass in a voice of thorough attestation , and with a wire - drawn smile of misery . "
42202	42219	42248	42248	I	0	" said Billy Smallbury , who had just entered , bearing his one tooth before him . "
42239	42240	42336	42336	I	0	" "
42253	42281	42336	42336	I	0	" wailed Henery , signifying wasted genius by gazing blankly at visions of a high destiny apparently visible to him on Billy Smallbury 's smock - frock . "
42330	42331	42371	42372	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" "
42343	42357	42442	42443	the maltster	3839	" said Mark Clark . God 's a perfect gentleman in that respect . "
42358	42369	42442	42443	the maltster	3839	" Good works good pay , so to speak it . "
42414	42440	42336	42336	I	0	" I wonder what a farmer - woman can want with a harpsichord , dulcimer , pianner , or whatever ' tis they d'call it ? "
42445	42453	42442	42443	the maltster	3839	" Liddy saith she've a new one . "
42454	42459	42336	42336	I	0	" Got a pianner ? "
42460	42518	42336	42336	I	0	" Ay . Seems her old uncle 's things were not good enough for her . She've bought all but everything new . There 's heavy chairs for the stout , weak and wiry ones for the slender ; great watches , getting on to the size of clocks , to stand upon the chimbley - piece . "

42548	42553	42616	42617	the conclave	1284	" said Mr. Clark . "
42569	42595	42737	42738	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" firm loud tread was now heard stamping outside ; the door was opened about six inches , and somebody on the other side exclaimed - "
42608	42614	42746	42746	Oak	144	lambs?"Ay , sure , shepherd . "
42716	42735	42746	42746	Oak	144	" Well , Shepherd Oak , and how 's lambing this year , if I mid say it ? "
42740	42744	42737	42738	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" Terrible trying , "
42748	42781	42746	42746	Oak	144	" I 've been wet through twice a - day , either in snow or rain , this last fortnight . Cainy and I have n't tined our eyes to - night . "
42782	42793	42834	42834	Joseph	196	" A good few twins , too , I hear ? "
42794	42820	42846	42846	Gabriel	144	" Too many by half . Yes ; ' tis a very queer lambing this year . We sha n't have done by Lady Day . "
42821	42833	42846	42846	Gabriel	144	" And last year ' twer all over by Sexajessamine Sunday . "
42837	42844	42937	42937	Gabriel	144	" Bring on the rest Cain . "
42848	42863	42937	42937	Gabriel	144	" and then run back to the ewes . I 'll follow you soon . "
42918	42935	42897	42897	Oak	144	" We 've no lambing - hut here , as I used to have at Norcombe . "
42939	42990	42937	42937	Gabriel	144	" and ' tis such a plague to bring the weakly ones to a house . If ' twasn't for your place here , malter , I do n't know what I should do ! this keen weather . And how is it with you to - day , malter ? "
42991	43005	43022	43026	the ancient man of malt	1288	" Oh , neither sick nor sorry , shepherd , but no younger . "
43006	43012	42937	42937	Gabriel	144	" Ay - I understand . "
43013	43020	43063	43065	a soul there	1289	" Sit down , Shepherd Oak , "
43028	43061	42937	42937	Gabriel	144	" And how was the old place at Norcombe , when ye went for your dog ? I should like to see the old familiar spot ; but faith , I should n't "

43264	43279	43348	43348	Mark	178	" inquired Oak , sharply turning to the rest , and getting very warm . "
43297	43302	43348	43348	Mark	178	" said Mark Clark ; "
43330	43347	43390	43390	you	1300	" The gallant Mark Clark here made a peculiar and well known sound with his own . "
43350	43356	43390	43390	you	1300	" said Gabriel , sternly , "
43393	43394	43417	43417	you	1302	" "
43407	43414	43477	43477	Matthew	181	" replied Mr. Clark , cordially . "
43424	43438	43477	43477	Matthew	181	" said Oak , turning to Joseph Poorgrass with a very grim look . "
43466	43476	43498	43498	I	0	" said Joseph , trembling and blushing with terror . "
43482	43483	43529	43529	somebody	3576	" "
43493	43497	43536	43536	neighbours	776	" asked Oak . "
43517	43526	43567	43567	my	0	" said Matthew Moon , looking very uneasy . "
43538	43564	43668	43668	he	1310	" Gabriel , though one of the quietest and most gentle men on earth , rose to the occasion , with martial promptness and vigour . "
43570	43627	43678	43679	a Dutchman	1311	" Here he placed his fist , rather smaller in size than a common loaf , in the mathemarical centre of the maltster 's little table , and with it gave a bump or two thereon , as if to ensure that their eyes all thoroughly took in the idea of fistiness before he went further . "
43646	43667	43678	43679	a Dutchman	1311	" here the fist was raised and let fall as T'hor might have done with his hammer in assaying it - "
43681	43721	43796	43796	We	1308	" All earnestly expressed by their features that their minds did not wander to Holland for a moment on account of this statement , but were deploring the difference which gave rise to the figure ; and Mark Clark cried "
43734	43762	43808	43808	shepherd	3738	" The dog George looked up at the same time after the shepherd 's menace , and though he understood English but imperfectly , began to growl . "
43778	43795	43841	43841	I	0	" said Henery , with a deprecating peacefulness equal to anything of the kind in Christianity . "
43810	43831	43878	43878	we	1308	" said Joseph Poorgrass with considerable anxiety from behind the maltster 's bed- stead whither he had retired for safety . "
43845	43861	43878	43878	we	1308	" he added , making move- ments associated with states of mind rather than body ; "
43873	43874	43878	43878	we	1308	" "
43883	43906	43937	43937	We	1308	" said Matthew Moon , with a small anxious laugh towards Oak , to show how very friendly disposed he was likewise . "
43916	43920	43959	43959	shepherd	3738	" said Oak . "
43932	43936	44059	44059	Joseph	196	" said Matthew . "

43973	44058	44145	44146	Matthew Moon	181	" said Gabriel , as a man of medium sentiments on the subject . names upon their waggons almost like copper - plate , with beautiful flourishes , and great long tails . A excellent fine thing for ye to be such a clever man , shepherd . Joseph Poorgrass used to prent to Farmer James Everdene 's waggons before you came , and ' a could never mind which way to turn the J 's and E 's - could ye , Joseph ? "
44075	44096	44159	44159	Joseph	196	" And so you used to do 'em the wrong way , like this , did n't ye , Joseph ? "
44109	44143	44159	44159	Joseph	196	" And how Farmer James would cuss , and call thee a fool , would n't he , Joseph , when ' a seed his name looking so inside - out - like ? "
44150	44157	44097	44097	Matthew	181	" Ay - ' a would . "
44163	44214	44159	44159	Joseph	196	" But , you see , I was n't so much to blame , for them J 's and E 's be such trying sons o ' witches for the memory to mind whether they face backward or forward ; and I always had such a forgetful memory , too . "
44215	44234	44300	44300	Oak	144	" ' Tis a bad afiction for ye , being such a man of calamities in other ways . "
44235	44286	44300	44300	Oak	144	" Well , ' tis ; but a happy Providence ordered that it should be no worse , and I feel my thanks . As to shepherd , there , I 'm sure mis'ess ought to have made ye her baily - such a fitting man for't as you be . "
44287	44298	44506	44506	his	196	" I do n't mind owning that I expected it . "
44304	44343	44529	44529	Gabriel	144	" Indeed , I hoped for the place . At the same time , Miss Everdene has a right to be own baily if she choose - and to keep me down to be a common shepherd only . "
44482	44501	44542	44542	Joseph	196	" And she do n't even let ye have the skins of the dead lambs , I hear ? "
44520	44527	44542	44542	Joseph	196	" I do n't have them . "
44531	44540	44584	44584	Gabriel	144	" Ye be very badly used , shepherd . "
44560	44573	44650	44650	he	231	" I think she 's took against ye - that I do . "
44574	44582	44650	44650	he	231	" O no - not at all . "
44638	44649	44714	44714	Gabriel	144	" Ah ! Oak , I thought you were here . "
44653	44694	44749	44749	Oak	144	" I met the mail - cart ten minutes ago , and a letter was put into my hand , which I opened without reading the address . I believe it is yours . You must excuse the accident please . "
44695	44712	44983	44984	FANNY ROBIN	217	" O yes - not a bit of difference , Mr. Boldwood - not a bit . "
44763	44905	44983	44984	FANNY ROBIN	217	" DEAR FRIEND , - I do not know your name , but l think these few lines will reach you , which I wrote to thank you for your kindness to me the night I left Weatherbury in a reckless way . I also return the money I owe you , which you will excuse my not keeping as a gift . All has ended well , and I am happy to say I am going to be married to the young man who has courted me for some time - Sergeant Troy , of the 11th Dragoon Guards , now quartered in this town . He would , I know , object to my having received anything except as a loan , being a man of great respecta- bility and high honour - indeed , a nobleman by blood . "
44972	44982	44989	44989	you	1323	" I am , your sincere well - wisher , "
44986	44987	45029	45029	Fanny	217	" "
44996	45000	45057	45057	she	217	" said Gabriel ; "
45019	45028	45071	45072	Sergeant Troy	243	" Boldwood read the letter and looked grieved . "
45062	45063	45105	45105	he	243	" "
45074	45078	45256	45257	silly girl	1345	" said Gabriel . "
45098	45103	45308	45309	Cain Ball	235	" the farmer murmured , "
45259	45305	45330	45330	I	0	" The door was hurriedly burst open again , and in came running Cainy Ball out of breath , his mouth red and open , like the bell of a penny trumpet , from which he coughed with noisy vigour and great distension of face . "
45311	45317	45377	45377	you	235	" said Oak , sternly , "
45338	45339	45377	45377	you	235	" "
45371	45372	45377	45377	you	235	" "
45381	45382	45426	45427	Shepherd Oak	192	" "
45390	45405	45426	45427	Shepherd Oak	192	" said the junior shepherd , supporting his exhausted youthful frame against the doorpost , "
45429	45430	45489	45489	Cainy	252	" "
45437	45455	45489	45489	Cainy	252	" said Oak , jumping up , and dimissing for the present his thoughts on poor Fanny . "
45507	45543	45585	45586	Mr. Boldwood	224	" Oak took from his illimitable pockets a marking iron , dipped it into the pot , and imprintcd on the buttocks of the infant sheep the initials of her he delighted to muse on - "
45547	45571	45724	45724	Oak	146	" which signified to all the region round that henceforth the lambs belonged to Farmer Bathsheba Everdene , and to no one else . "
45588	45716	45736	45736	you	252	" The shepherd lifted the sixteen large legs and four small bodies he had himself brought , and vanished with them in the direction of the lambing field hard by - their frames being now in a sleek and hopeful state , pleasantly contrasting with their death's - door plight of half an hour before . Boldwood followed him a little way up the field , hesitated , and turned back . He followed him again with a last resolve , annihilating return . On approaching the nook in which the fold was constructed , the farmer drew out - his pocket - book , unfastened - it , and allowed it to lie open on his hand . A letter was revealed - Bath- sheba 's . "
45726	45734	45736	45736	you	252	" he said , with unreal carelessness , "
45743	45759	45810	45810	Boldwood	224	" Oak glanced into the book , and replied instantly , with a flushed face , "
45764	45789	45842	45842	he	224	" Oak had coloured simply at the consciousness of sounding her name . He now felt a strangely distressing qualm from a new thought . "
45822	45827	45857	45857	he	224	" Is it I ? "

45921	46260	45857	45857	he	224	" Soon parting from Gabriel , the lonely and reserved man returned to his house to breakfast - feeling twinges of shame and regret at having so far exposed his mood by those fevered questions to a stranger . He again placed the letter on the mantelpiece , and sat down to think of the circumstances attending it by the light of Gabriel 's information . CHAPTER XVI ALL SAINTS ' AND ALL SOULS ' ON a week - day morning a small congregation , con- sisting mainly of women and girls , rose from its knees in the mouldy nave of a church called All Saints ' , in the distant barrack - town before mentioned , at the end of a service without a sermon . They were about to disperse , when a smart footstep , entering the porch and coming up the central passage , arrested their attention . The step echoed with a ring unusual in a church ; it was the clink of spurs . Everybody looked . A young cavalry soldier in a red uniform , with the three chevrons of a sergeant upon his sleeve , strode up the aisle , with an embarrassment which was only the more marked by the intense vigour of his step , and by the deter- mination upon his face to show none . A slight flush had mounted his cheek by the time he had run the gauntlet between these women ; but , passing on through the chancel arch , he never paused till he came close to the altar railing . Here for a moment he stood alone . The officiating curate , who had not yet doffed his surplice , perceived the new - comer , and followed him to the communion - space . He whispered to the soldier , and then beckoned to the clerk , who in his turn whispered to an elderly woman , apparently his wife , and they also went up the chancel steps . "
46266	46275	45857	45857	he	224	" murmured some of the women , brightening . "
46280	46432	46542	46543	the woman	3527	" The majority again sat down . There was a creaking of machinery behind , and some of the young ones turned their heads . From the interior face of the west wall of the tower projected a little canopy with a quarter - jack and small bell beneath it , the automaton being driven by the same clock machinery that struck the large bell in the tower . Be- tween the tower and the church was a close screen , the door of which was kept shut during services , hiding this grotesque clockwork from sight . At present , how- ever , the door was open , and the egress of the jack , the blows on the bell , and the mannikin 's retreat into.the nook again , were visible to many , and audible through- out the church . The jack had struck half - past eleven . "
46438	46538	46542	46543	the woman	3527	" whispered some of the spectators . The young sergeant stood still with the abnormal rigidity of the old pillars around . He faced the south- east , and was as silent as he was still . The silence grew to be a noticeable thing as the minutes went on , and nobody else appeared , and not a soul moved . The rattle of the quarter - jack again from its niche , its blows for three - quarters , its fussy retreat , were almost painfully abrupt , and caused many of the congregation to start palpably . "
46546	46916	47013	47014	You fool	1355	" a voice whispered again . There began now that slight shifting of feet , that artificial coughing among several , which betrays a nervous suspense . At length there was a titter . But the soldier never moved . There he stood , his face to the south - east , upright as a column , his cap in his hand . The clock ticked on . The women threw off their nervousness , and titters and giggling became more frequent . Then came a dead silence . Every one was waiting for the end . Some persons may have noticed how extraordinarily the striking of quarters . seems to quicken the flight of time . It was hardly credible that the jack had not got wrong with the minutes when the rattle began again , the puppet emerged , and the four quarters were struck fitfully as before : One could al- most be positive that there was a malicious leer upon the hideous creature 's face , and a mischievous delight in its twitchings . Then , followed the dull and remote resonance of the twelve heavy strokes in the tower above . The women were impressed , and there was no giggle this time . The clergyman glided into the vestry , and the clerk vanished . The sergeant had not yet turned ; every woman in the church was waiting to see his face , and he appeared to know it . At last he did turn , and stalked resolutely down the nave , braving them all , with a compressed lip . Two bowed and toothless old almsmen then looked at each other and chuckled , innocently enough ; but the sound had a strange weird effect in that place . Opposite to the church was a paved square , around which several overhanging wood buildings of old time cast a picturesque shade . The young man on leaving the door went to cross the square , when , in the middle , he met a little woman . The expression of her face , which had been one of intense anxiety , sank at the sight of his nearly to terror . "
46919	46933	47013	47014	You fool	1355	" he said , in a suppressed passion , fixedly looking at her . "
47011	47012	47035	47035	Frank	244	" "
47026	47027	47035	47035	Frank	244	" "
47037	47042	47072	47072	you	244	" she asked blankly . "
47047	47057	47072	47072	you	244	" and he gave vent to a hoarse laugh . "
47074	47075	47100	47101	dear Frank	244	" "
47080	47088	47100	47101	dear Frank	244	" she expostulated in a trembling voice , "
47108	47109	47602	47603	Miss Everdene	167	" "
47117	47600	47628	47631	A very handsome girl	1357	" he said , with a light irony , and turning from her walked rapidly away . CHAPTER XVII IN THE MARKET - PLACE ON Saturday Boldwood was in Casterbridge market house as usual , when the disturber of his dreams entered and became visible to him . Adam had awakened from his deep sleep , and behold ! there was Eve . The farmer took courage , and for the first time really looked at her . Material causes and emotional effects are not to be arranged in regular equation . The result from capital employed in the production of any movement of a mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the cause itself is absurdly minute . When women are in a freakish mood , their usual intuition , either from carelessness or inherent defect , seemingly fails to teach them this , and hence it was that Bathsheba was fated to be astonished today . Boldwood looked at her - not slily , critically , or understandingly , but blankly at gaze , in the way a reaper looks up at a passing train - as something foreign to his element , and but dimly understood . To Bold- wood women had been remote phenomena rather than necessary complements - comets of such uncertain aspect , movement , and permanence , that whether their orbits were as geometrical , unchangeable , and as subject to laws as his own , or as absolutely erratic as they superficially appeared , he had not deemed it his duty to consider . He saw her black hair , her correct facial curves and profile , and the roundness of her chin and throat . He saw then the side of her eyelids , eyes , and lashes , and the shape of her ear . Next he noticed her figure , her skirt , and the very soles of her shoes . Boldwood thought her beautiful , but wondered whether he was right in his thought , for it seemed impossible that this romance in the flesh , if so sweet as he imagined , could have been going on long without creating a commotion of delight among men , and pro- voking more inquiry than Bathsheba had done , even though that was not a little . To the best of his judge- ment neither nature nor art could improve this perfect one of an imperfect many . His heart began to move within him . Boldwood , it must be remembered , though forty years of age , had never before inspected a woman with the very centre and force of his glance ; they had struck upon all his senses at wide angles . Was she really beautiful ? He could not assure himself that his opinion was true even now . He fur- tively said to a neighbour , "
47607	47608	47822	47824	the injured lover	1358	" "
47634	47695	47822	47824	the injured lover	1358	" A man is never more credulous than in receiving favourable opinions on the beauty of a woman he is half , or quite , in love with ; a mere child 's word on the point has the weight of an R.A. 's . Boldwood was satisfied now . And this charming woman had in effect said to him , "
47699	47821	47822	47824	the injured lover	1358	" Why should she have done that strange thing ? Boldwood 's blindness to the difference between approving of what circumstances suggest , and originating what they do not suggest , was well matched by Bathsheba 's insensibility to the possibly great issues of little beginnings . She was at this moment coolly dealing with a dashing young farmer , adding up accounts with him as indiffer- ently as if his face had been the pages of a ledger . It was evident that such a nature as his had no attraction for a woman of Bathsheba 's taste . But Boldwood grew hot down to his hands with an incipient jealousy ; he trod for the first time the threshold of "
47828	49438	47822	47824	the injured lover	1358	" His first impulse was to go and thrust himself between them . This could be done , but only in one way - by asking to see a sample of her corn . Boldwood renounced the idea . He could not make the request ; it was debasing loveliness to ask it to buy and sell , and jarred with his conceptions of her . All this time Bathsheba was conscious of having broken into that dignified stronghold at last . His eyes , she knew , were following her everywhere . This was a triumph ; and had it come naturally , such a triumph would have been the sweeter to her for this piquing delay . But it had been brought about by misdirected ingenuity , and she valued it only as she valued an artificial flower or a wax fruit . Being a woman with some good sense in reasoning on subjects wherein her heart was not involved , Bath- sheba genuinely repented that a freak which had owed its existence as much to Liddy as to herself , should ever have been undertaken , to disturb the placidity of a man she respected too highly to deliberately tease . She that day nearly formed the intention of begging his pardon on the very next occasion of their meeting . The worst features of this arrangement were that , if he thought she ridiculed him , an apology would in- crease the offence by being disbelieved ; and if he thought she wanted him to woo her , it would read like additional evidence of her forwardness . CHAPTER XVIII BOLDWOOD IN MEDITATION - REGRET BOLDWOOD was tenant of what was called Little Weatherbury Farm , and his person was the nearest ap- proach to aristocracy that this remoter quarter of the parish could boast of . Genteel strangers , whose god was their town , who might happen to be compelled to linger about this nook for a day , heard the sound of light wheels , and prayed to see good society , to the degree of a solitary lord , or squire at the very least , but it was only Mr. Boldwood going out for the day . They heard the sound of wheels yet once more , and were re - animated to expectancy : it was only Mr. Bold- wood coming home again . His house stood recessed from the road , and the stables , which are to a farm what a fireplace is to a room , were behind , their lower portions being lost amid bushes of laurel . Inside the blue door , open half - way down , were to be seen at this time the backs and tails of half - a - dozen warm and contented horses standing in their stalls ; and as thus viewed , they pre- sented alternations of roan and bay , in shapes like a Moorish arch , the tail being a streak down the midst of each . Over these , and lost to the eye gazing in from the outer light , the mouths of the same animals could be heard busily sustaining the above - named warmth and plumpness by quantities of oats and hay . The restless and shadowy figure of a colt wandered about a loose - box at the end , whilst the steady grind of all the eaters was occasionally diversified by the rattle of a rope or the stamp of a foot . Pacing up and down at the heels of the animals was Farmer Boldwood himself . This place was his almonry and cloister in one : here , after looking to the feeding of his four - footed dependants , the celibate would walk and meditate of an evening till the moon 's rays streamed in through the cobwebbed windows , or total darkness enveloped the scene . His square - framed perpendicularity showed more fully now than in the crowd and bustle of the market - house . In this meditative walk his foot met the floor with heel and toe simultaneously , and his fine reddish - fleshed face was bent downwards just enough to render obscure the still mouth and the well - rounded though rather prominent and broad chin . A few clear and thread - like horizontal lines were the only interruption to the otherwise smooth surface of his large forehead . The phases of Boldwood 's life were ordinary enough , but his was not an ordinary nature . That stillness , which struck casual observers more than anything else in his character and habit , and seemed so precisely like the rest of inanition , may have been the perfect balance of enormous antagonistic forces - positives and negatives in fine adjustment . His equilibrium disturbed , he was in extremity at once . If an emotion possessed him at all , it ruled him ; a feeling not mastering him was entirely latent . Stagnant or rapid , it was never slow . He was always hit mortally , or he was missed . He had no light and careless touches in his constitu- tion , either for good or for evil . Stern in the outlines of action , mild in the details , he was serious throughout all . He saw no absurd sides to the follies of life , and thus , though not quite companionable in the eyes of merry men and scoffers , and those to whom all things show life as a jest , he was not intolerable to the earnest and those acquainted with grief . Being a man -who read all the dramas of life seriously , if he failed to please when they were comedies , there was no frivolous treat- ment to reproach him for when they chanced to end tragically . Bathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and silent shape upon which she had so carelessly thrown a seed was a hotbed of tropic intensity . Had she known Boldwood 's moods , her blame would have been fearful , and the stain upon her heart ineradicable . Moreover , had she known her present power for good or evil over this man , she would have trembled at her responsibility . Luckily for her present , unluckily for her future tran- quillity , her understanding had not yet told her what Boldwood was . Nobody knew entirely ; for though it was possible to form guesses concerning his wild capa- bilities from old floodmarks faintly visible , he had never been seen at the high tides which caused them . Farmer Boldwood came to the stable - door and looked forth across the level fields . Beyond the first enclosure was a hedge , and on the other side of this a meadow belonging to Bathsheba 's farm . It was now early spring - the time of going to grass with the sheep , when they have the first feed of the meadows , before these are laid up for mowing . The wind , which had been blowing east for several weeks , had veered to the southward , and the middle of spring had come abruptly - almost without a beginning . It was that period in the vernal quarter when we map suppose the Dryads to be waking for the season . The vegetable world begins to move and swell and the saps to rise , till in the completest silence of lone gardens and trackless plantations , where- everything seems -help- less and still after the bond and slavery of frost , there are bustlings , strainings , united thrusts , and pulls - all- together , in comparison with which the powerful tugs of cranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but pigmy efforts . Boldwood , looking into the distant meadows , saw there three figures . They were those of Miss Everdene , Shepherd Oak , and Cainy Ball . When Bathsheba 's figure shone upon the farmer 's eyes it lighted him up as the moon lights up a great tower . A man 's body is as the shell ; or the tablet , of his soul , as he is reserved or ingenuous , overflowing or self - contained . There was a change in Boldwood 's exterior from its former impassibleness ; and his face showed that he was now living outside his defences for the first time , and with a fearful sense of exposure . It is the usual experience of strong natures when they love . At last he arrived at a conclusion . It was to go across and inquire boldly of her . The insulation of his heart by reserve during these many years , without a channel of any kind for disposable emotion , had worked its effect . It has been observed more than once that the causes of love are chiefly subjective , and Boldwood was a living testimony to the truth of the proposition . No mother existed to absorb his devotion , no sister for his tenderness , no idle ties for sense . He became surcharged with the compound , which was genuine lover 's love . He approached the gate of the meadow . Beyond it the ground was melodious with ripples , and the sky with larks ; the low bleating of the flock mingling with both . Mistress and man were engaged in the operation of making a lamb "
49441	49988	47822	47824	the injured lover	1358	" which is performed whenever an ewe has lost her own offspring , one of the twins of another ewe being given her as a substitute . Gabriel had skinned the dead lamb , and was tying the skin over the body of the live lamb , in the customary manner , whilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four hurdles , into which the Mother and foisted lamb were driven , where they would remain till the old sheep conceived an affection for the young one . Bathsheba looked up at the completion of the manouvre , and saw the farmer by the gate , where he was overhung by a willow tree in full bloom . Gabriel , to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an April day , was ever regardful of its faintest changes , and instantly discerned thereon the mark of some influence from without , in the form of a keenly self - conscious reddening . He also turned and beheld Boldwood . At onee connecting these signs with the letter Bold- wood had shown him , Gabriel suspected her of some coquettish procedure begun by that means , and carried on since , he knew not how . Farmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting that they were aware of his presence , and the perception was as too much light turned upon his new sensibility . He was still in the road , and by moving on he hoped that neither would recognize that he had originally intended to enter the field . He passed by with an utter and overwhelming sensation of ignorance , shyness , and doubt . Perhaps in her manner there were signs that she wished to see him - perhaps not - he could not read a woman . The cabala of this erotic philosophy seemed to consist of the subtlest meanings expressed in misleading ways . Every turn , look , word , and accent contained a mystery quite distinct from its obvious import , and not one had ever been pondered by him until now . As for Bathsheba , she was not deceived into the belief that Farmer Boldwood had walked by on business or in idleness . She collected the probabilities of the case , and concluded that she was herself responsible for Boldwood 's appearance there . It troubled her much to see what a great flame a little Wildfire was likely to kindle . Bathsheba was no schemer for marriage , nor was she deliberately a trifler with the affections of men , and a censor 's experience on seeing an actual flirt after observing her would have been a feeling of surprise that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one , and yet so like what a flirt is supposed to be . She resolved never again , by look or by sign , to interrupt the steady flow of this man 's life . But a resolution to avoid an evil is seldom framed till the evil is so far advanced as to make avoidance impossible . CHAPTER XIX THE SHEEP - WASHING - THE OFFER BOLDWOOD did eventually call upon her . She was not at home . "
49993	50919	47822	47824	the injured lover	1358	" he murmured . In con- templating Bathsheba as a woman , he had forgotten the accidents of her position as an agriculturist - that being as much of a farmer , and as extensive a farmer , as himself , her probable whereabouts was out - of - doors at this time of the year . This , and the other oversights Boldwood was guilty of , were natural to the mood , and still more natural to the circumstances . The great aids to idealization in love were present here : occasional observation of her from a distance , and the absence of social intercourse with her - visual familiarity , oral strangeness . The smaller human elements were kept out of sight ; the pettinesses that enter so largely into all earthly living and doing were disguised by the accident of lover and loved - one not being on visiting terms ; and there was hardly awakened a thought in Boldwood that sorry household realities appertained to her , or that she , like all others , had moments of commonplace , when to be least plainly seen was to be most prettily remembered . Thus a mild sort of apotheosis took place in his fancy , whilst she still lived and breathed within his own horizon , a troubled creature like himself . It was the end of May when the farmer determined to be no longer repulsed by trivialities or distracted by suspense . He had by this time grown used to being in love ; the passion now startled him less even when it tortured him more , and he felt himself adequate to the situation . On inquiring for her at her house they had told him she was at the sheepwashing , and he went off to seek her there . The sheep - washing pool was a perfectly circular basin of brickwork in the meadows , full of the clearest water . To birds on the wing its glassy surface , reflecting the light sky , must have been visible for miles around as a glistening Cyclops ' eye in a green face . The grass about the margin at this season was a sight to remember long - in a minor sort of way . Its activity in sucking the moisture from the rich damp sod . was almost a pro- cess observable by the eye . The outskirts of this level water - meadow were diversified by rounded and hollow pastures , where just now every flower that was not a buttercup was a daisy . The river slid along noiselessly as a shade , the swelling reeds and sedge forming a flexible palisade upon its moist brink . To the north of the mead were trees , the leaves of which were new , soft , and moist , not yet having stiffened and darkened under summer sun and drought , their colour being yellow beside a green - green beside a yellow . From the recesses of this knot of foliage the loud notes of three cuckoos were resounding through the still air . Boldwood went meditating down the slopes with his eyes on his boots , which the yellow pollen from the buttercups had bronzed in artistic gradations . A tribu- tary of the main stream flowed through the basin of the pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its diameter . Shepherd Oak , Jan Coggan , Moon , Poor- grass , Cain Ball , and several others were assembled here , all dripping wet to the very roots of their hair , and Bathsheba was standing by in a new riding - habit - the most elegant she had ever worn - the reins of her horse being looped over her arm . Flagons of cider were rolling about upon the green . The meek sheep were pushed into the pool by Coggan and Matthew Moon , who stood by the lower hatch , immersed to their waists ; then Gabriel , who stood on the brink , thrust them under as they swam along , with an instrument like a crutch , formed for the purpose , and also for assisting the exhausted animals when the wool became saturated and they began to sink . They were let out against the stream , and through the upper opening , all impurities flowing away below . Cainy Ball and Joseph , who performed this latter operation , were if possible wetter than the rest ; they resembled dolphins under a fountain , every protuberance and angle of their clothes dribbling forth a small rill . Boldwood came close and bade her good - morning , with such constraint that she could not but think he had stepped across to the washing for its own sake , hoping not to find her there ; more , she fancied his brow severe and his eye slighting . Bathsheba immediately contrived to withdraw , and glided along by the river till she was a stone 's throw off . She heard footsteps brushing the grass , and had a consciousness that love was encircling her like a perfume . Instead of turning or waiting , Bathsheba went further among the high sedges , but Boldwood seemed determined , and pressed on till they were completely past the bend of the river . Here , without being seen , they could hear the splashing and shouts of the washers above . "
50923	50935	51070	51070	I	0	" said the farmer . She trembled , turned , and said "
50939	51069	51157	51157	I	0	" His tone was so utterly removed from all she had expected as a beginning . It was lowness and quiet accentuated : an emphasis of deep meanings , their form , at the same time , being scarcely expressed . Silence has sometimes a remarkable power of showing itself as the disembodied soul of feeling wandering without its carcase , and it is then more impressive than speech . In the same way , to say a little is often to tell more than to say a great deal . Boldwood told everything in that word . As the consciousness expands on learning that what was fancied to be the rumble of wheels is the reverbera- tion of thunder , so did Bathsheba 's at her intuitive conviction . "
51080	51089	51157	51157	I	0	" he said , with a solemn simplicity . "
51127	51156	51270	51270	I	0	" Bathsheba tried to preserve an absolutely neutral countenance , and all the motion she made was that of closing lips which had previously been a little parted . "
51166	51171	51332	51332	you	167	" he went on . "
51268	51269	51344	51344	I	0	" "
51299	51325	51353	51353	me	0	" she stammered . This giving back of dignity for dignity seemed to open the sluices of feeling that Boldwood had as yet kept closed . "
51334	51343	51457	51457	I	0	" he exclaimed , in a low voice . "
51362	51386	51459	51459	I	0	" Bathsheba answered nothing , and the mare upon her arm seemed so impressed that instead of cropping the herbage she looked up . "
51405	51456	51542	51542	she	0	" Bathsheba 's momentary impulse at hearing this was to ask why he thought that , till she remembered that , far from being a conceited assumption on Boldwood 's part , it was but the natural conclusion of serious reflec- tion based on deceptive premises of her own offering . "
51467	51476	51542	51542	she	0	" the farmer continued in an easier tone , "
51532	51541	51552	51552	him	1365	" The valentine again ! O that valentine ! "
51554	51574	51542	51542	she	0	" If you can love me say so , Miss Everdene . If not - do n't say no ! "
51575	51649	51542	51542	she	0	" Mr. Boldwood , it is painful to have to say I am surprised , so that I do n't know how to answer you with propriety and respect - but am only just able to speak out my feeling - I mean my meaning ; that I am afraid I ca n't marry you , much as I respect you . You are too dignified for me to suit you , sir . "
51650	51656	51552	51552	him	1365	" But , Miss Everdene ! "
51657	51714	51861	51861	She	1366	" I - I did n't - I know I ought never to have dreamt of sending that valentine - forgive me , sir - it was a wanton thing which no woman with any self - respect should have done . If you will only pardon my thought- lessness , I promise never to - - "
51715	51840	52122	52122	Bathsheba	243	" No , no , no . Do n't say thoughtlessness ! Make me think it was something more - that it was a sort of prophetic instinct - the beginning of a feeling that you would like me . You torture me to say it was done in thoughtlessness - I never thought of it in that light , and I ca n't endure it . Ah ! I wish I knew how to win you ! but that I ca n't do - I can only ask if I have already got you . If I have not , and it is not true that you have come unwittingly to me as I have to you , I can say no more . "
51841	51860	52221	52221	She	1368	" I have not fallen in love with you , Mr. Boldwood - certainly I must say that . "
51912	52121	52221	52221	She	1368	" But you will just think - in kindness and conde- scension think - if you can not bear with me as a husband ! I fear I am too old for you , but believe me I will take more care of you than would many a man of your own age . I will protect and cherish you with all my strength - I will indeed ! You shall have no cares - be worried by no household affairs , and live quite at ease , Miss Everdene . The dairy superintendence shall be done by a man - I can afford it will - you shall never have so much as to look out of doors at haymaking time , or to think of weather in the harvest . I rather cling ; to the chaise , because it is he same my poor father and mother drove , but if you do n't like it I will sell it , and you shall have a pony - carriage of your own . I can not say how far above every other idea and object on earth you seem to me - nobody knows - God only knows - how much you are to me ! "
52144	52220	52288	52288	you	1367	" Do n't say it ! do n't ! I can not bear you to feel so much , and me to feel nothing . And I am afraid they will notice us , Mr. Boldwood . Will you let the matter rest now ? I can not think collectedly . I did not know you were going to say this to me . O , I am wicked to have made you suffer so ! "
52232	52248	52288	52288	you	1367	" Say then , that you do n't absolutely refuse . Do not quite refuse ? "
52249	52260	52288	52288	you	1367	" I can do nothing . I can not answer . "I
52270	52271	52276	52276	I	0	" "
52274	52275	52288	52288	you	1367	" "
52282	52283	52288	52288	you	1367	" "
52294	52295	52317	52317	I	0	" "

52399	52469	53333	53333	she	0	" he said . And then she turned away . Boldwood dropped his gaze to the ground , and stood long like a man who did not know where he was . Realities then returned upon him like the pain of a wound received in an excitement which eclipses it , and he , too , then went on . CHAPTER XX PERPLEXITY - GRINDING THE SHEARS - A QUARREL "
52485	53172	53333	53333	she	0	" Bathsheba mused . Yet Farmer Boldwood , whether by nature kind or the reverse to kind , did not exercise kindness , here . The rarest offerings of the purest loves are but a self- indulgence , and no generosity at all . Bathsheba , not being the least in love with him , was eventually able to look calmly at his offer . It was one which many women of her own station in the neighbour- hood , and not a few of higher rank , would have been wild to accept and proud to publish . In every point of view , ranging from politic to passionate , it was desirable that she , a lonely girl , should marry , and marry this earnest , well - to - do , and respected man . He was close to her doors : his standing was sufficient : his qualities were even supererogatory . Had she felt , which she did not , any wish whatever for the married state in the abstract , she could not reasonably have rejected him , being a woman who frequently appealed to her under , standing for deliverance from her whims . Boldwood as a means to marriage was unexceptionable : she esteemed and liked him , yet she did not want him . It appears that ordinary men take wives because possession is not possible without marriage , and that ordinary women accept husbands because marriage is not possible with , out possession ; with totally differing aims the method is the same on both sides . But the understood incentive on the woman 's part was wanting here . Besides , Bath- sheba 's position as absolute mistress of a farm and house was a novel one , and the novelty had not yet begun to wear off . But a disquiet filled her which was somewhat to her credit , for it would have affected few . Beyond the men- tioned reasons with which she combated her objections , she had a strong feeling that , having been the one who began the game , she ought in honesty to accept the conse- quences . Still the reluctance remained . She said in the same breath that it would be ungenerous not to marry Boldwood , and that she could n't do it to save her life . Bathsheba 's was an impulsive nature under a delibera- tive aspect . An Elizabeth in brain and a Mary Stuart in spirit , she often performed actions of the greatest temerity with a manner of extreme discretion . Many of her thoughts were perfect syllogisms ; unluckily they always remained thoughts . Only a few were irrational assumptions ; but , unfortunately , they were the ones which most frequently grew into deeds . The next day to that of the declaration she found Gabriel Oak at the bottom of her garden , grinding his shears for the sheep - shearing . All the surrounding cottages were more or less scenes of the same operation ; the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts of the village as from an armury previous to a campaign . Peace and war kiss each other at their hours of prepara- tion - sickles , scythes , shears , and pruning - hooks , ranking with swords , bayonets , and lances , in their common necessity for point and edge . Cainy Ball turned the handle of Gabriel 's grindstone , his head performing a melancholy see - saw up and down with each turn of the wheel . Oak stood somewhat as Eros is represented when in the act of sharpening his arrows : his figure slightly bent , the weight of his body thrown over on the shears , and his head balanced side- ways , with a critical compression of the lips and contrac- tion of the eyelids to crown the attitude . His mistress came up and looked upon them in silence for a minute or two ; then she said - "
53318	53332	53412	53412	they	3799	" Will you turn , Gabriel , and let me hold the shears ? "
53336	53384	53412	53412	they	3799	" My head is in a'whirl , and I ca n't talk . Gabriel turned . Bathsheba then began , with some awkwardness , allowing her thoughts to stray occasion- ally from her story to attend to the shears , which required a little nicety in sharpening . "
53408	53409	53432	53432	you	243	" "
53415	53419	53432	53432	you	243	" said Gabriel . "
53443	53481	53586	53586	they	3799	" He relinquished the winch , and inclosing her two hands completely in his own taking each as we some- times slap a child 's hand in teaching him to write , grasped the shears with her . "
53487	53517	53562	53563	the men	3799	" he said . Hands and shears were inclined to suit the words , and held thus for a peculiarly long time by the in- structor as he spoke . "
53522	53526	53562	53563	the men	3799	" exclaimed Bathsheba . "
53542	53560	53562	53563	the men	3799	" Gabriel freed her hands quietly , retired to his handle , and the grinding went on . "
53568	53573	53586	53586	they	3799	" she said again . "
53582	53583	53586	53586	they	3799	" "
53589	53590	53672	53672	They	3799	" "
53613	53614	53672	53672	They	3799	" "
53655	53671	53672	53672	They	3799	" Gabriel looked incredulous and sad , but between his moments of incredulity , relieved . "
53679	53683	53710	53710	you	167	" she continued . "
53690	53706	53806	53806	I	0	" said Oak , stopping the handle , and gazing into her face with astonishment . "
53713	53720	53842	53842	I	0	" she said , with dignity . "
53764	53805	53856	53856	I	0	" Bathsheba regarded him with round - eyed perplexity . She did not know whether to pity him for disappointed love of her , or to be angry with him for having got over it - his tone being ambiguous . "
53828	53841	53890	53890	Gabriel	144	" she mur- mured , with a slight decline in her assurance . "
53871	53872	54177	54177	she	0	" "
53884	53888	54177	54177	she	0	"I suppose not . "
54165	54176	54282	54282	She	0	" Well , what is your opinion of my conduct . "
54182	54198	54282	54282	She	0	" That it is unworthy of any thoughtful , and meek , and comely woman . "
54252	54281	54412	54412	I	0	" Perhaps you do n't like the rudeness of my repri- manding you , for I know it is rudeness ; but I thought it would do good . "
54287	54312	54282	54282	She	0	" On the contrary , my opinion of you is so low , that I see in your abuse the praise of discerning people ! "
54313	54334	54438	54438	Gabriel	144	" I am glad you do n't mind it , for I said it honestly and with every serious meaning . "
54335	54407	54438	54438	Gabriel	144	" I see . But , unfortunately , when you try not to speak in jest you are amusing - just as when you wish to avoid seriousness you sometimes say a sensible word It was a hard hit , but Bathsheba had unmistakably lost her temper , and on that account Gabriel had never in his life kept his own better . He said nothing . She then broke out - "
54430	54436	54438	54438	Gabriel	144	" Not by any means . "
54441	54452	54438	54438	Gabriel	144	" I have long given up thinking of that matter . "Or
54459	54487	54715	54715	I	0	" she said ; and it was apparent that she expected an unhesitating denial of this supposition . Whatever Gabriel felt , he coolly echoed her words - "
54493	54623	54736	54736	I	0	" A woman may be treated with a bitterness which is sweet to her , and with a rudeness which is not offensive . Bathsheba would have submitted to an indignant chastisement for her levity had Gabriel pro- tested that he was loving her at the same time ; the impetuosity of passion unrequited is bearable , even if it stings and anathematizes there is a triumph in the humiliation , and a tenderness in the strife . This was what she had been expecting , and what she had not got . To be lectured because the lecturer saw her in the cold morning light of open - shuttered disillusion was exasperating . He had not finished , either . He continued in a more agitated voice : - "
54707	54714	54742	54742	you	1386	" Bathsheba laid down the shears . "
54729	54733	54742	54742	you	1386	" she exclaimed . "
54755	54806	54849	54849	I	0	" It may have been a peculiarity - at any rate it was a fact - that when Bathsheba was swayed by an emotion of an earthly sort her lower lip trembled : when by a refined emotion , her upper or heavenward one . Her nether lip quivered now . "
54814	54848	54849	54849	I	0	" said Gabriel calmly . He had been held to her by a beautiful thread which it pained him to spoil by breaking , rather than by a chain he could not break . "
54860	54864	54894	54894	me	0	" he added . "
54875	54890	54906	54907	Miss Everdene	167	" said she , her eyes flashing at his , though never meeting them . "
54901	54902	55060	55060	Sixty	272	" "
54914	55001	55060	55060	Sixty	272	" And he took his shears and went away from her in placid dignity , as Moses left the presence of Pharaoh . CHAPTER XXI TROUBLES IN THE FOLD - A MESSAGE GABRIEL OAK had ceased to feed the Weatherbury flock for about four - and - twenty hours , when on Sunday afternoon the elderly gentlemen Joseph Poorgrass , Matthew Moon , Fray , and half - a - dozen others , came running up to the house of the mistress of the Upper Farm . "
55009	55059	55060	55060	Sixty	272	" she said , meeting them at the door just as she was coming out on her way to church , and ceasing in a moment from the close compression of her two red lips , with which she had accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight glove . "
55062	55067	55088	55088	Sheep	262	" said Joseph Poorgrass . "
55070	55074	55088	55088	Sheep	262	" said Moon . "

55238	55241	55287	55287	Joseph	196	" Yes . "
55245	55263	55287	55287	Joseph	196	" and I was sitting at home , looking for Ephesians , and says I to myself , "
55276	55286	55287	55287	Joseph	196	" when who should come in but Henery there : "
55289	55293	55356	55357	you fools	1396	" he said , "
55309	55344	55401	55403	the stupid numskulls	1398	" With Bathsheba it was a moment when thought was speech and speech exclamation . Moreover , she had hardly recovered her equanimity since the disturbance which she had suffered from Oak 's remarks . "
55359	55384	55401	55403	the stupid numskulls	1398	" she cried , throwing the parasol and Prayer - book into the passage , and running out of doors in the direction signified . "
55405	55639	55674	55674	I	0	" Her eyes were at their darkest and brightest now . Bathsheba 's beauty belonged rather to the demonian than to the angelic school , she never looked so well as when she was angry - and particularly when the effect was heightened by a rather dashing velvet dress , care- fully put on before a glass . All the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after her to the clover - field , Joseph sinking down in the midst when about half - way , like an individual withering in a world which was more and more insupportable . Having once received the stimulus that her presence always gave them they went round among the sheep with a will . The majority of the afflicted animals were lying down , and could not be stirred . These were bodily lifted out , and the others driven into the adjoining field . Here , after the lapse of a few minutes , several more fell down , and lay helpless and livid as the rest . Bathsheba , with a sad , bursting heart , looked at these primest specimens of her prime flock as they rolled there - Swoln with wind and the rank mist they drew . Many of them foamed at the mouth , their breathing being quick and short , whilst the bodies of all were fearfully distended . "
55652	55658	55674	55674	I	0	" said Bathsheba , helplessly . "

56055	56073	56092	56092	your	1409	" chimed in Henery Fray , reflectively , with an Oriental indifference to the flight of time . "
56076	56081	56092	56092	your	1409	" burst out Bathsheba , "
56088	56090	56162	56162	she	1415	" ayes "
56095	56108	56227	56227	she	1415	" talking at me ! Get somebody to cure the sheep instantly ! "
56152	56161	56227	56227	she	1415	" Never will I send for him never ! "
56213	56226	56307	56307	Bathsheba	243	" O , what shall I do - what shall I do ! "
56235	56249	56307	56307	Bathsheba	243	" I wo n't send for him . No , I wo n't ! "
56299	56305	56335	56335	Laban	213	" No , I wo n't "
56311	56317	56307	56307	Bathsheba	243	" I think I must . "
56341	56347	56381	56381	Tall	213	" Where is Oak staying ? "
56348	56356	56616	56616	Bathsheba	243	" Across the valley at Nest Cottage ! "
56357	56380	56632	56632	she	1433	" Jump on the bay mare , and ride across , and say he must return instantly - that I say so . "
56608	56614	56662	56662	Bathsheba	243	" O , what folly ! "
56624	56631	56691	56691	Laban	213	" Perhaps he is already gone ! "
56657	56660	56698	56700	the young farmer	1063	" Well ? "
56680	56689	56714	56715	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" He says beggars must n't be choosers . "
56693	56696	56761	56761	his	196	" What ! "
56724	56747	56864	56864	I	0	" He says he shall not come unless you request en to come civilly and in a proper manner , as becomes any "
56753	56754	56871	56871	miss	1011	" "
56795	56863	56897	56897	Gable	186	" Another of the flock sprang into the air , and fell dead . The men looked grave , as if they suppressed opinion . Bathsheba turned aside , her eyes full of tears . The strait she was in through pride and shrewishness could not be disguised longer : she burst out crying bitterly ; they all saw it ; and she attempted no further concealment . "
56873	56881	56939	56939	he	196	" said William Small- bury , compassionately . "
56906	56916	56939	56939	he	196	" Bathsheba checked her grief and wiped her eyes . "
56933	56937	57059	57059	Gabriel	144	" she murmured . "
56960	57053	57646	57646	Gabriel	144	" After this collapse , not very dignified for the head of an establishment , she went into the house , Tall at her heels . Here she sat down and hastily scribbled a note between the small convulsive sobs of convalescence which follow a fit of crying as a ground - swell follows a storm . The note was none the less polite for being written in a hurry . She held it at a distance , was about to fold it , then added these words at the bottom : - "
57061	57303	57688	57688	I	0	" She looked a little redder in refolding it , and closed her lips , as if thereby to suspend till too late the action of conscience in examining whether such strategy were justifiable . The note was despatched as the message had been , and Bathsheba waited indoors for the result . It was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened between the messenger 's departure and the sound of the horse 's tramp again outside . She- could not watch this time , but , leaning over the old bureau at which she had written the letter , closed her eyes , as if to keep out both hope and fear . The case , however , was a promising one . Gabriel was not angry : he was simply neutral , although her first command had been so haughty . Such imperiousness would have damned a little less beauty ; and on the other hand , such beauty would have redeemed a little less imperiousness . She went out when the horse was heard , and looked up . A mounted figure passed between her and the sky , and drew on towards the field of sheep , the rider turning his face in receding . Gabriel looked at her . It was a moment when a woman 's eyes and tongue tell distinctly opposite tales . Bathsheba looked full of gratitude , and she said : - "
57316	57645	57688	57688	I	0	" Such a tenderly - shaped reproach for his previous delay was the one speech in the language that he could pardon for not being commendation of his readiness now . Gabriel murmured a confused reply , and hastened on . She knew from the look which sentence in her note had brought him . Bathsheba followed to the field . Gabriel was already among the turgid , prostrate forms . He had flung off his coat , rolled up his shirt - sleeves , and taken from his pocket the instrument of salvation . It was a small tube or trochar , with a lance passing down the inside ; and Gabriel began to use it with a dexterity that would have graced a hospital surgeon . Passing his hand over the sheep 's left flank , and selecting the proper point , he punctured the skin and rumen with the lance as it stood in the tube ; then he suddenly withdrew the lance , retaining the tube in its place . A current of air rushed up the tube , forcible enough to have extinguished a candle held at the orifice . It has been said that mere ease after torment is de- light for a time ; and the countenances of these poor creatures expressed it now . Forty - nine operations were successfully performed . Owing to the great hurry necessitated by the far - gone state of some of the flock , Gabriel missed his aim in one case , and in one only - striking wide of the mark , and inflicting a mortal blow at once upon the suffering ewe . Four had died ; three recovered without an operation . The total number of sheep which had thus strayed and injured themselves so dangerously was fifty - seven . When the love - led man had ceased from his labours , Bathsheba came and looked him in the face . "
57655	57687	59312	59312	Bathsheba	243	" she , said , smiling winningly , and not troubling to bring her lips quite together again at the end , because there was going to be another smile soon . "
57691	59106	59565	59565	Bathsheba	243	" said Gabriel . And she smiled on him again . CHAPTER XXII THE GREAT BARN AND THE SHEEP - SHEARERS MEN thin away to insignificance and oblivion quite as often by not making the most of good spirits when they have them as by lacking good spirits when they are indispensable . Gabriel lately , for the first time since his prostration by misfortune , had been independent in thought and vigorous in action to a marked extent - conditions which , powerless without an opportunity as an opportunity without them is barren , would have given him a sure lift upwards when the favourable - con- junction should have occurred . But this incurable loitering beside Bathsheba Everdene stole his time ruinously . The spring tides were going by without floating him off , and the neap might soon come which could not . It was the first day of June , and the sheep - shearing season culminated , the landscape , even to the leanest pasture , being all health and colour . Every green was young , every pore was open , and every stalk was swollen with racing currents of juice . God was palpably present in the country , and the devil had gone with the world to town . Flossy catkins of the later kinds , fern - sprouts like bishops ' croziers , the square - headed moschatel , the odd cuckoo - pint , - like an apoplectic saint in a niche of malachite , - snow - white ladies'-smocks , the toothwort , approximating to human flesh , the enchanter 's night- shade , and the black - petaled doleful - bells , were among the quainter objects of the vegetable world in and about Weatherbury at this teeming time ; and of the animal , the metamorphosed figures of Mr. Jan Coggan , the master - shearer ; the second and third shearers , who travelled in the exercise of their calling , and do not re- quire definition by name ; Henery Fray the fourth shearer , Susan Tall 's husband the fifth , Joseph Poorgrass the sixth , young Cain Ball as assistant - shearer , and Gabriel Oak as general supervisor . None of these were clothed to any extent worth mentioning , each appearing to have hit in the matter of raiment the decent mean between a high and low caste Hindoo . An angularity of lineament , and a fixity of facial machinery in general , proclaimed that serious work was the order of the day . They sheared in the great barn , called for the nonce the Shearing - barn , which on ground - plan resembled a church with transepts . It not only emulated the form of the neighbouring church of the parish , but vied with it in antiquity . Whether the barn had ever formed one of a group of conventual buildings nobody seemed to be aware ; no trace of such surroundings remained . The vast porches at the sides , lofty enough to admit a waggon laden to its highest with corn in the sheaf , were spanned by heavy - pointed arches of stone , broadly and boldly cut , whose very simplicity was the origin of a grandeur not apparent in erections where more ornament has been attempted . The dusky , filmed , chestnut roof , braced and tied in by huge collars , curves , and diagonals , was far nobler in design , because more wealthy in material , than nine - tenths of those in our modern churches . Along each side wall was a range of striding buttresses , throwing deep shadows on the spaces between them , which were perforated by lancet openings , combining in their proportions the precise requirements both of beauty and ventilation . One could say about this barn , what could hardly be said of either the church or the castle , akin to it in age and style , that the purpose which had dictated its original erection was the same with that to which it was still applied . Unlike and superior to either of those two typical remnants of mediaevalism , the old barn embodied practices which had suffered no mutila- tion at the hands of time . Here at least the spirit of the ancient builders was at one with the spirit of the modern beholder . Standing before this abraded pile , the eye regarded its present usage , the mind - dwelt upon its past history , with a satisfied sense of functional continuity throughout - a feeling almost of gratitude , and quite of pride , at the permanence of the idea which had heaped it up . The fact that four centuries had neither proved it to be founded on a mistake , inspired any hatred of its purpose , nor given rise to any reaction that had battered it down , invested this simple grey effort of old minds with a repose , if not a grandeur , which a too curious reflection was apt to disturb in its ecclesiastical and military compeers . For once medievalism and modernism had a common stand- point . The lanccolate windows , the time - eaten arch- stones and chamfers , the orientation of the axis , the misty chestnut work of the rafters , referred to no exploded fortifying art or worn - out religious creed . The defence and salvation of the body by daily bread is still a study , a religion , and a desire . To - day the large side doors were thrown open towards the sun to admit a bountiful light to the immediate spot of the shearers ' operations , which was the wood threshing - floor in the centre , formed of thick oak , black with age and polished by the beating of flails for many generations , till it had grown as slippery and as rich in hue as the state - room floors of an Elizabethan mansion . Here the shearers knelt , the sun slanting in upon their bleached shirts , tanned arms , and the polished shears they flourished , causing these to bristle with a thousand rays strong enough to blind a weak - eyed man . Beneath them a captive sheep lay panting , quickening its pants as misgiving merged in terror , till it quivered like the hot landscape outside . This picture of to - day in its frame of four hundred years ago did not produce that marked contrast between ancient and modern which is implied by the contrast of date . In comparison with cities , Weatherbury was immutable . The citizen 's Then is the rustic 's Now . In London , twenty or thirty - years ago are old times ; in Paris ten years , or five ; in Weatherbury three or four score years were included in the mere present , and nothing less than a century set a mark on its face or tone . Five decades hardly modified the cut of a gaiter , the embroidery of a smock - frock , by the breadth of a hair . Ten generations failed to alter the turn of a single phrase . In these Wessex nooks the busy out- sider 's ancient times are only old ; his old times are still new ; his present is futurity . So the barn was natural to the shearers , and the shearers were in harmony with the barn . The spacious ends of the building , answering ecclesi- astically to nave and chancel extremities , were fenced off with hurdles , the sheep being all collected in a crowd within these two enclosures ; and in one angle a catching- pen was formed , in which three or four sheep were continuously kept ready for the shearers to seize without loss of time . In the background , mellowed by tawny shade , were the three women , Maryann Money , and Temperance and Soberness Miller , gathering up the fleeces and twisting ropes of wool with a wimble for tying them round . They were indifferently well assisted by the old maltster , who , when the malting season from October to April had passed , made himself useful upon any of the bordering farmsteads . "

60587	60617	60725	60725	Coggan	180	" I am going now to see Mr. Boldwood 's Leicesters . Take my place in the barn , Gabriel , and keep the men carefully to their work . "
60695	60700	60749	60750	Laban Tall	213	" That means matrimony . "
60714	60723	60756	60757	Henery Fray	195	" I reckon that 's the size o't . "
60733	60747	60917	60917	Henery	195	" Well , better we d over the mixen than over the moor , "
60768	60824	60917	60917	Henery	195	" I do n't see why a maid should take a husband when she 's bold enough to fight her own battles , and do n't want a home ; for ' tis keeping another woman out . But let it be , for ' tis a pity he and she should trouble two houses . "
60925	60984	60917	60917	Henery	195	" I once hinted my mind to her on a few things , as nearly as a battered frame dared to do so to such a froward piece . You all know , neighbours , what a man I be , and how I come down with my powerful words when my pride is boiling wi ' scarn ? "
60985	60994	61041	61041	I	0	" We do , we do , Henery . "
60995	61000	61041	61041	I	0	" So I said , "

61230	61249	61322	61322	My	0	" said Oak , with a pharisaical sense that he was not as other shearers in this matter . "
61258	61265	61360	61360	goodmen	1486	" said Henery , with dudgeon ; "

61423	61433	61545	61545	Malter	286	" interposed the maltster , in a querulous voice . "
61512	61532	61565	61565	Nobody	439	" It was the unvaying custom in Weatherbury to sink minor differences when the maltster had to be pacified . "
61540	61544	61565	61565	Nobody	439	" said Jan Coggan.- "

61638	61700	61965	61965	I	0	" The bent and hoary ' man was satisfied , and so apparently was Henery Frag . That matters should continue pleasant Maryann spoke , who , what with her brown complexion , and the working wrapper of rusty linsey , had at present the mellow hue of an old sketch in oils - notably some of Nicholas Poussin 's : - "
61728	61732	62000	62000	We	1506	" said Maryann . "
61765	61964	62000	62000	We	1506	" Coggan furnished a suitable reply . Oak went on with his shearing , and said not another word . Pestilent moods had come , and teased away his quiet . Bathsheba had shown indications of anointing him above his fellows by installing him as the bailiff that the farm imperatively required . He did not covet the post relatively to the farm : in relation to herself , as beloved by him and unmarried to another , he had coveted it . His readings of her seemed now to be vapoury and indistinct . His lecture to her was , he thought , one of the absurdest mistakes . Far from coquetting with Boldwood , she had trifled with himself in thus feigning that she had trifled with another . He was inwardly convinced that , in accordance with the anticipations of his easy - going and worse - educated comrades , that day would see Boldwood the accepted husband of Miss Everdene . Gabriel at this time of his life had out- grown the instinctive dislike which every Christian boy has for reading the Bible , perusing it now quite frequently , and he inwardly said , "
61980	61999	62101	62101	I	0	" This was mere exclamation - the froth of the storm . He adored Bathsheba just the same . "
62011	62025	62101	62101	I	0	" said Cainy Ball , casting forth his thoughts in a new direction . "
62110	62111	62375	62375	Gabriel	144	" "
62124	62128	62375	62375	Gabriel	144	" said Maryann . "
62141	62156	62383	62383	you	144	" said Joseph Poorgrass , in a pleasant , masticating manner of anticipa- tion . "
62201	62374	62391	62392	Mr. Boldwood	224	" CHAPTER XXIII EVENTIDE - A SECOND DECLARATION FOR the shearing - supper a long table was placed on the grass - plot beside the house , the end of the table being thrust over the sill of the wide parlour window and a foot or two into the room . Miss Everdene sat inside the window , facing down the table . She was thus at the head without mingling with the men . This evening Bathsheba was unusually excited , her red cheeks and lips contrasting lustrously with the mazy skeins of her shadowy hair . She seemed to expect assistance , and the seat at the bottom of the table was at her request left vacant until after they had begun and the duties appertaining to that end , which he did with great readiness . At this moment Mr. Boldwood came in at the gate , and crossed the green to Bathsheba at the window . He apologized for his lateness : his arrival was evidently by arrangement . "
62377	62381	62600	62600	your	177	" said she , "
62396	62594	62600	62600	your	177	" Oak moved in silence back to his original seat . The gentleman - farmer was dressed in cheerful style , in a new coat and white waistcoat , quite contrasting with his usual sober suits of grey . Inwardy , too , he was blithe , and consequently chatty to an exceptional degree . So also was Bathsheba now that he had come , though the uninvited presence of Pennyways , the bailiff who had been dismissed for theft , disturbed her equan- imity for a while . Supper being ended , Coggan began on his own private account , without reference to listeners : - l've lost my love and l care not , I 've lost my love , and l care not ; I shall soon have another That 's better than t'other ! I 've lost my love , and I care not . This lyric , when concluded , was received with a silently appreciative gaze at the table , implying that the performance , like a work by those established authors who are independent of notices in the papers , was a well - known delight which required no applause . "
62603	62607	62639	62639	Joseph	196	" said Coggan . "
62623	62630	62658	62658	mistress	996	" said Joseph , diminishing himself . "
62643	62656	62727	62727	Coggan	180	" said Coggan , expressing hurt feelings by an inflection of voice . "
62671	62680	62727	62727	Coggan	180	" Sing at once , Joseph Poor- grass . "
62681	62715	62751	62751	Joseph	196	" Faith , so she is ; well , I must suffer it ! ... Just eye my features , and see if the tell - tale blood overheats me much , neighbours ? "
62716	62725	62751	62751	Joseph	196	" No , yer blushes be quite reasonable . "
62729	62749	62782	62782	Bathsheba	243	" I always tries to keep my colours from rising when a beauty 's eyes get fixed on me . "
62755	62769	62796	62796	he	196	" but if so be ' tis willed they do , they must . "
62770	62780	62796	62796	he	196	" Now , Joseph , your song , please . "
62788	62795	62751	62751	Joseph	196	" Well , really , ma'am . "
62804	62825	62751	62751	Joseph	196	" I do n't know what to say . It would be a poor plain ballet of my own composure . "
62830	62946	63117	63117	Joseph	196	" said the supper - party . Poorgrass , thus assured , trilled forth a flickering yet commendable piece of sentiment , the tune of which consisted of the key - note and another , the latter being the sound chiefly dwelt upon . This was so successful that he rashly plunged into a second in the same breath , after a few false starts : - I sow'-ed th'-e I sow'-ed I sow'-ed the'-e seeds ' of love ' , I - it was ' all ' i'-in the'-e spring ' , I - in A'-pril ' , Ma'-ay , a'-nd sun'-ny ' June ' , When sma'-all bi'-irds they ' do ' sing . "
62953	62975	62751	62751	Joseph	196	" said Coggan , at the end of the verse . ` They do sing ' was a very taking paragraph . "
62976	62991	63020	63021	Master Poorgrass	177	" Ay ; and there was a pretty place at ' seeds of love . "
63000	63002	63117	63117	Joseph	196	" love "
63023	63113	63559	63559	she	167	" But during this rendering young Bob Coggan ex- hibited one of those anomalies which will afflict little people when other persons are particularly serious : in trying to check his laughter , he pushed down his throat as much of the tablecloth as he could get hold of , when , after continuing hermetically sealed for a short time , his mirth burst out through his nose . Joseph perceived it , and with hectic cheeks of indignation instantly ceased singing . Coggan boxed Bob 's ears immediately . "
63129	63133	63606	63606	she	1519	" said Coggan . "
63565	63571	63606	63606	she	1519	" The Banks of Allan Water "
63598	63605	63624	63624	She	1519	" Have you brought your flute ? "
63609	63614	64094	64094	he	231	" Yes , miss . "
63615	63623	64094	64094	he	231	" Play to my singing , then . "
64070	64093	64094	64094	he	231	" I like to give praise where praise is due , and the man deserves it - that ' a do so . "
64116	64137	64190	64190	you	1546	" I 'm sure I should never have believed it if we had n't proved it , so to allude , "
64142	64179	64205	64205	I	0	" that every cup , every one of the best knives and forks , and every empty bottle be in their place as perfect now as at the beginning , and not one stole at all . "
64194	64202	64276	64276	he	251	" said the virtuous thief , grimly . "
64212	64216	64301	64301	Pennyways	251	" added Coggan , "
64283	64286	64525	64525	she	167	" Well . "
64303	64357	64525	64525	she	167	" said Joseph ; to which opinion the remainder of the company subscribed unanimously . At this time of departure , when nothing more was visible of the inside of the parlour than a thin and still chink of light between the shutters , a passionate scene was in course of enactment there . "
64516	64524	64525	64525	she	167	" I will try to love you . "
64541	64616	64672	64673	your wife	4111	" And if I can believe in any way that I shall make you a good wife I shall indeed be willing to marry you . But , Mr. Boldwood , hesitation on so high a matter is honourable in any woman , and I do n't want to give a solemn promise to - night . I would rather ask you to wait a few weeks till I can see my situation better . "But
64627	64628	64687	64687	I	0	" "
64675	64681	64715	64716	Miss Everdene	167	" she said , firmly . "
64693	64694	64715	64716	Miss Everdene	167	" "
64721	64722	64715	64716	Miss Everdene	167	" "
64727	65261	65660	65660	I	0	" she said , graciously - almost tenderly ; and Boldwood withdrew with a serene smile . Bathsheba knew more of him now ; he had entirely bared his heart before her , even until he had almost worn in her eyes the sorry look of a grand bird without the feathers that make it grand . She had been awe- struck at her past temerity , and was struggling to make amends without thinking whether the sin quite deserved the penalty she was schooling herself to pay . To have brought all this about her ears was terrible ; but after a while the situation was not without a fearful joy . The facility with which even the most timid woman some- times acquire a relish for the dreadful when that is amalgamated with a little triumph , is marvellous . CHAPTER XXIV THE SAME NIGHT - THE FIR PLANTATION AMONG the multifarious duties which Bathsheba had voluntarily imposed upon herself by dispensing with the services of a bailiff , was the particular one of looking round the homestead before going to bed , to see that all was right and safe for the night . Gabriel had almost constantly preceded her in this tour every evening , watching her affairs as carefully as any specially appointed officer of surveillance could have done ; but this tender devotion was to a great extent unknown to his mistress , and as much as was known was somewhat thanklessly received . Women are never tired of bewailing man 's fickleness in love , but they only seem to snub his con- stancy . As watching is best done invisibly , she usually carried a dark lantern in her hand , and every now and then turned on the light to examine nooks and corners with the coolness of a metropolitan policeman . This cool- ness may have owed its existence not so much to her fearlessness of expected danger as to her freedom from the suspicion of any ; her worst anticipated discovery being that a horse might not be well bedded , the fowls not all in , or a door not closed . This night the buildings were inspected as usual , and she went round to the farm paddock . Here the only sounds disturbing the stillness were steady munch- ings of many mouths , and stentorian breathings from all but invisible noses , ending in snores and puffs like the blowing of bellows slowly . Then the munching would recommence , when the lively imagination might assist the eye to discern a group of pink - white nostrils , shaped as caverns , and very clammy and humid on their sur- faces , not exactly pleasant to the touch until one got used to them ; the mouths beneath having a great partiality for closing upon any loose end of Bathsheba 's apparel which came within reach of their tongues . Above each of these a still keener vision suggested a brown forehead and two staring though not unfriendly eyes , and above all a pair of whitish crescent - shaped horns like two particularly new moons , an occasional stolid "
65264	65635	65664	65664	mate	1554	" proclaiming beyond the shade of a doubt that these phenomena were the features and persons of Daisy , Whitefoot , Bonny - lass , Jolly - O , Spot , Twinkle - eye , etc . , etc . - the respectable dairy of Devon cows belonging to Bathsheba aforesaid . Her way back to the house was by a path through a young plantation of tapering firs , which had been planted some years earlier to shelter the premises from the north wind . By reason of the density of the interwoven foliage overhead , it was gloomy there at cloudless noontide , twilight in the evening , dark as midnight at dusk , and black as the ninth plague of Egypt at midnight . To describe the spot is to call it a vast , low , naturally formed hall , the plumy ceiling of which was supported by slender pillars of living wood , the floor being covered with a soft dun carpet of dead spikelets and mildewed cones , with a tuft of grass - blades here and there . This bit of the path was always the crux of the night 's ramble , though , before starting , her apprehen- sions of danger were not vivid enough to lead her to take a companion . Slipping along here covertly as Time , Bathsheba fancied she could hear footsteps enter- ing the track at the opposite end . It was certainly a rustle of footsteps . Her own instantly fell as gently as snowflakes . She reassured herself by a remembrance that the path was public , and that the traveller was probably some villager returning home ; regetting , at the same time , that the meeting should be about to occur in the darkest point of her route , even though only just outside her own door . The noise approached , came close , and a figure was apparently on the point of gliding past her when some- thing tugged at her skirt and pinned it forcibly to the ground . The instantaneous check nearly threw Bath- sheba off her balance . In recovering she struck against warm clothes and buttons . "
65644	65658	65664	65664	mate	1554	" said a masculine voice , a foot or so above her head . "
65666	65667	65688	65688	I	0	" "
65670	65680	65688	65688	I	0	" said Bathsheba , attempting to shrink a way . "
65691	65692	65698	65698	you	0	" "
65695	65696	65708	65709	A lady	611	" "
65702	65703	65708	65709	A lady	611	" "

65734	65745	65754	65754	I	0	" Bathsheba softly tugged again , but to no purpose . "
65758	65763	65773	65773	I	0	" said the man . "
65766	65767	65937	65937	I	0	" "
65783	65936	65967	65967	you	0	" A hand seized the lantern , the door was opened , the rays burst out from their prison , and Bathsheba beheld her position with astonishment . The man to whom she was hooked was brilliant in brass and scarlet . He was a soldier . His sudden appearance was to darkness what the sound of a trumpet is to silense . Gloom , the genius loci at all times hitherto , was now totally overthrown , less by the lantern - light than by what the lantern lighted . The contrast of this revelation with her anticipations of some sinister figure in sombre garb was so great that it had upon her the effect of a fairy transformation . It was immediately apparent that the military man 's spur had become entangled in the gimp which decorated the skirt of her dress . He caught a view of her face . "
65947	65957	65967	65967	you	0	" he said , with new - born gallantry . "
65969	66160	65967	65967	you	0	" she hastily replied , and stooped for the performance . The unfastening was not such a trifling affair . The rowel of the spur had so wound itself among the gimp cords in those few moments , that separation was likely to be a matter of time . He too stooped , and the lantern standing on the ground betwixt them threw the gleam from its open side among the fir - tree needles and the blades of long damp grass with the effect of a large glowworm . It radiated upwards into their faces , and sent over half the planta- tion gigantic shadows of both man and woman , each dusky shape becoming distorted and mangled upon the tree - trunks till it wasted to nothing . He looked hard into her eyes when she raised them for a moment ; Bathsheba looked down again , for his gaze was too strong to be received point - blank with her own . But she had obliquely noticed that he was young and slim , and that he wore three chevrons upon his sleeve . Bathsheba pulled again . "
66176	66183	65967	65967	you	0	" said the soldier , drily . "
66197	66198	66226	66226	he	1562	" "
66204	66210	66296	66301	the young sergeant , without ceremony	1563	" she exclaimed , helplessly . "
66211	66224	66316	66316	she	1011	" It would n't be necessary if you could wait a moment , "
66282	66294	66354	66354	he	1562	" Thank you for the sight of such a beautiful face ! "
66308	66315	66378	66378	She	1011	" ' Twas un- willingly shown . "
66341	66353	66378	66378	She	1011	" I like you the better for that incivility , miss . "

66396	66425	66378	66378	She	1011	" I deserve the chastisement your words give me . But why should such a fair and dutiful girl have such an aversion to her father 's sex ? "
66426	66434	66378	66378	She	1011	" Go on your way , please . "
66435	66457	66495	66496	the sergeant	1330	" What , Beauty , and drag you after me ? Do but look ; I never saw such a tangle ! "
66458	66483	66511	66511	she	1565	" O , ' tis shameful of you ; you have been making it worse on purpose to keep me here - you have ! "
66484	66493	66533	66533	miss	1011	" Indeed , I do n't think so . "
66503	66510	66565	66565	I	0	" I tell you you have ! "

66593	66703	66715	66715	I	0	" She closed her lips in a determined silence . Bathsheba was revolving in her mind whether by a bold and desperate rush she could free herself at the risk of leaving her skirt bodily behind her . The thought was too dreadful . The dress - which she had put on to appear stately at the supper - was the head and front of her wardrobe ; not another in her stock became her so well . What woman in Bathsheba 's position , not naturally timid , and within call of her retainers , would have bought escape from a dashing soldier at so dear a price ? "
66718	66724	66715	66715	I	0	" said her cool friend . "

66776	66791	66804	66806	the young man	547	" he said , bowing low . Bathsheba really knew not what to say . "
66827	66857	66804	66806	the young man	547	" but I 've never seen a woman so beautiful as you . Take it or leave it - be offended or like it - I do n't care . "
66858	66874	66991	66991	he	547	" Who are you , then , who can so well afford to despise opinion ? "
66875	66926	67031	67031	Bathsheba	243	" No stranger . Sergeant Troy . I am staying in this place . - There ! it is undone at last , you see . Your light fingers were more eager than mine . I wish it had been the knot of knots , which there 's no untying ! "
66981	66990	67027	67027	her	1568	" Ah , Beauty ; good - bye ! "
67048	67079	67027	67027	her	1568	" Liddy , is any soldier staying in the village - sergeant somebody - rather gentlemanly for a sergeant , and good looking - a red coat with blue facings ? "
67080	67122	67031	67031	Bathsheba	243	" No , miss ... No , I say ; but really it might be Sergeant Troy home on furlough , though I have not seen him . He was here once in that way when the regiment was at Casterbridge . "
67123	67141	67027	67027	her	1568	" Yes ; that 's the name . Had he a moustache - no whiskers or beard ? "
67142	67146	67027	67027	her	1568	" He had . "
67147	67156	67031	67031	Bathsheba	243	" What kind of a person is he ? "
67157	67228	67027	67027	her	1568	" O ! miss - I blush to name it - a gay man ! But I know him to be very quick and trim , who might have made his thousands , like a squire . Such a clever young dandy as he is ! He 's a doctor 's son by name , which is a great deal ; and he 's an earl 's son by nature ! "
67229	67243	67031	67031	Bathsheba	243	" Which is a great deal more . Fancy ! Is it true ? "
67244	67369	67507	67507	he	726	" Yes . And , he was brought up so well , and sent to Casterbridge Grammar School for years and years . Learnt all languages while he was there ; and it was said he got on so far that he could take down Chinese in shorthand ; but that I do n't answer for , as it was only reported . However , he wasted his gifted lot , and listed a soldier ; but even then he rose to be a sergeant without trying at all . Ah ! such a blessing it is to be high - born ; nobility of blood will shine out even in the ranks and files . And is he really come home , miss ? "
67370	67381	67507	67507	he	726	" I believe so . Good - night , Liddy . "
67514	67515	68083	68083	His	1580	" "
67522	67535	68622	68622	he	243	" she at last exclaimed to herself , in her own room . "
67563	68038	68914	68915	the sergeant	1330	" Clearly she did not think his barefaced praise of her person an insult now . It was a fatal omission of Boldwood 's that he had never once told her she was beautiful . CHAPTER XXV THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE DESCRIBED IDIOSYNCRASY and vicissitude had combined to stamp Sergeant Troy as an exceptional being . He was a man to whom memories were an in- cumbrance , and anticipations a superfluity . Simply feeling , considering , and caring for what was before his eyes , he was vulnerable only in the present . His out- look upon time was as a transient flash of the eye now and then : that projection of consciousness into days gone by and to come , which makes the past a synonym for the pathetic and the future a word for circum- spection , was foreign to Troy . With him the past was yesterday ; the future , to - morrow ; never , the day after . On this account he might , in certain lights , have been regarded as one of the most fortunate of his order . For it may be argued with great plausibility that reminiscence is less an endowment than a disease , and that expectation in its only comfortable form - that of absolute faith - is practically an impossibility ; whilst in the form of hope and the secondary compounds , patience , impatience , resolve , curiosity , it is a constant fluctuation between pleasure and pain . Sergeant Troy , being entirely innocent of the practice of expectation , was never disappointed . To set against this negative gain there may have been some positive losses from a certain narrowing of the higher tastes and sensations which it entailed . But limitation of the capacity is never recognized as a loss by the loser therefrom : in this attribute moral or aesthetic poverty contrasts plausibly with material , since those who suffer do not mind it , whilst those who mind it soon cease to suffer . It is not a denial of anything to have been always without it , and what Troy had never enjoyed he did not miss ; but , being fully conscious that what sober people missed he enjoyed , his capacity , though really less , seemed greater than theirs . He was moderately truthful towards men , but to women lied like a Cretan - a system of ethics above all others calculated to win popularity at the first flush of admission into lively society ; and the possibility of the favour gained being transitory had reference only to the future . He never passed the line which divides the spruce vices from the ugly ; and hence , though his morals had hardly been applauded , disapproval of them "
68609	68621	68914	68915	the sergeant	1330	" Treat them fairly , and you are a lost man . "
68906	68912	68914	68915	the sergeant	1330	" AH , Miss Everdene ! "
68922	68947	68914	68915	the sergeant	1330	" Little did I think it was you I was speaking to the other night . And yet , if I had reflected , the "
68954	68978	69089	69095	the Queen of the Corn - market	1622	" truth is truth at any hour of the day or night , and I heard you so named in Casterbridge yesterday , the "
68986	69073	69121	69121	he	1330	" I say , could be no other woman . I step across now to beg your forgiveness a thousand times for having been led by my feelings to express myself too strongly for a stranger . To be sure I am no stranger to the place - I am Sergeant Troy , as I told you , and I have assisted your uncle in these fields no end of times when I was a lad . I have been doing the same for you today . "
69074	69087	69121	69121	he	1330	" I suppose I must thank you for that , Sergeant Troy . "
69111	69120	69089	69095	the Queen of the Corn - market	1622	" Indeed you must not , Miss Everdene . "
69124	69134	69121	69121	he	1330	" Why could you think such a thing necessary ? "
69135	69143	69121	69121	he	1330	" I am glad it is not . "
69144	69154	69121	69121	he	1330	" Why ? if I may ask without offence . "
69155	69167	69216	69216	I	0	" Because I do n't much want to thank you for any "

70180	70286	70172	70172	Liddy	191	" She paused . Capitulation - that was the purport of the simple reply , guarded as it was - capitulation , unknown to her- self . Never did a fragile tailless sentence convey a more perfect meaning . The careless sergeant smiled within himself , and probably too the devil smiled from a loop - hole in Tophet , for the moment was the turning- point of a career . Her tone and mien signified beyond mistake that the seed which was to lift the foundation had taken root in the chink : the remainder was a mere question of time and natural changes . "
70293	70301	70172	70172	Liddy	191	" said the soldier , in reply . "
70324	70350	70464	70469	some one man on an average	1653	" well , Miss Everdene , you are - pardon my blunt way - you are rather an injury to our race than other- wise . "
70355	70363	70692	70694	The handsome sergeant	1654	" she said , opening her eyes . "
70450	70462	70722	70722	he	1654	" The sergeant looked down the mead in critical abstrac- ion . "
70472	70691	70750	70750	she	1655	" love , with each ordinary woman . She can marry him : he is content , and leads a useful life . Such women as you a hundred men always covet - your eyes will be- witch scores on scores into an unavailing fancy for you you can only marry one of that many . Out of these say twenty will endeavour to . drown the bitterness of espised love in drink ; twenty more will mope away their lives without a wish or attempt to make a mark in he world , because they have no ambition apart from their attachment to you ; twenty more - the susceptible person myself possibly among them - will be always draggling after you , getting where they may just see you , doing desperate things . Men are such constant fools ! The rest may try to get over their passion with more or less success . But all these men will be saddened . And not only those ninety - nine men , but the ninety - nine women they might have married are saddened with them . There 's my tale . That 's why I say that a woman so charming as yourself , Miss Ever- dene , is hardly a blessing to her race . "
70725	70731	70791	70791	He	1654	" Do you read French ? "
70732	70749	70750	70750	she	1655	" No ; I began , but when I got to the verbs , father died . "
70754	70790	70750	70750	she	1655	" I do - when I have an opportunity , which latterly has not been often my mother was a Parisienne - and there 's a proverb they have , Qui aime bien chatie bien - "
70797	70803	70894	70894	you	1657	" Do you understand me ? "
70806	70826	70900	70900	I	0	" she replied , and there was even a little tremu- lousness in the usually cool girl 's voice ; "
70852	70880	70906	70906	I	0	" And then poor Bathsheba instantly perceived her slip in making this admission : in hastily trying to retrieve it , she went from bad to worse . "

70911	70933	71000	71000	I	0	" said Troy , with much hearty conviction on the exterior of his face : and altering the expression to moodiness ; "

71009	71056	71189	71189	you	1657	" said Bathsheba , looking askance at a reed she was fitfully pulling with one hand , having lately grown feverish under the soldier 's system of procedure - not because the nature of his cajolery was entirely unperceived , but because its vigour was overwhelming .

71704	71715	71782	71782	she	301	" Why , you only saw me the other night ! "
71716	71741	71782	71782	she	301	" That makes no difference . The lightning works in- stantaneously . I loved you then , at once - as I do now . "
71772	71781	71854	71854	he	1330	" You can not and you do n't . "
71786	71831	71854	71854	he	1330	" There is - no such sudden feeling in people . I wo n't listen to you any longer . Hear me , I wish I knew what o'clock it is - I am going - I have wasted too much time here already ! "
71842	71853	71904	71907	the young - man	1672	" What , have n't you a watch , miss ? "
71857	71874	71936	71936	he	1330	" I have not just at present - I am about to get a new one . "
71875	71898	71936	71936	he	1330	" No . You shall be given one . Yes - you shall . A gift , Miss Everdene - a gift . "
71920	71935	71936	71936	he	1330	" It is an unusually good one for a man like me to possess . "
71940	71955	71854	71854	he	1330	" That watch has a history . Press the spring and open the back . "
71960	71966	71936	71936	he	1330	" What do you see ? "
71967	71974	71854	71854	he	1330	" A crest and a motto . "

71995	72086	72126	72127	a dissembler	1673	" It 's the motto of the Earls of Severn . That watch belonged to the last lord , and was given to my mother 's husband , a medical man , for his use till I came of age , when it was to be given to me . It was all the fortune that ever I inherited . That watch has regulated imperial interests in its time - the stately ceremonial , the courtly assigna- tion , pompous travels , and lordly sleeps . Now it is yours . "
72102	72112	72126	72127	a dissembler	1673	" she exclaimed , with round - eyed wonder . "

72330	72419	72507	72507	you	243	" said the sergeant , with an intonation of such exquisite fidelity to nature that it . was evidently not all acted now . Her beauty , which , whilst it had been quiescent , he had praised in jest , had in its animated phases moved him to earnest ; and though his seriousness was less than she imagined , it was probably more than he imagined himself . Bathsheba was brimming with agitated bewilderment , and she said , in half - suspicious accents of feeling , "
72514	72593	72642	72642	I	0	" A factitious reply had been again upon his lips , but it was again suspended , and he looked at her with an arrested eye . The truth was , that as she now stood - excited , wild , and honest as the day - her alluring beauty bore out so fully the epithets he had bestowed upon it that he was quite startled at his temerity in advancing them as false . He said mechanically , "
72598	72606	72642	72642	I	0	" and continued to look at her . "
72628	72641	72704	72704	you	243	" she went on , unconscious of the transmutation she was effecting . "

73329	73347	73454	73454	she	167	" Miss Everdene , let me assist you ; you should not attempt such a thing alone . "

73441	73453	73492	73492	Troy	243	" What ! and will you shake them in for me ? "
73486	73490	73511	73511	Troy	243	" Will I ! "
73494	73510	73492	73492	Troy	243	" Why , of course I will . How blooming you are to - day ! "
73526	73544	73511	73511	Troy	243	" But you must have on the veil and gloves , or you 'll be stung fearfully ! "
73545	73570	73492	73492	Troy	243	" Ah , yes . I must put on the veil and gloves . Will you kindly show me how to fix them properly ? "
73571	73603	73795	73795	Troy	243	" And you must have the broad - brimmed hat , too , for your cap has no brim to keep the veil off , and they 'd reach your face . "
73604	73617	73795	73795	Troy	243	" The broad - brimmed hat , too , by all means . "
73788	73793	73826	73826	he	243	" Upon my life . "
73801	73820	73870	73870	she	167	" holding up this hive makes one 's arm ache worse than a week of sword - exercise . "
73830	73853	73870	73870	she	167	" Would you be good enough to untie me and let me out ? I am nearly stifled inside this silk cage . "
73874	73884	73870	73870	she	167	" I have never seen that you spoke of . "
73885	73888	73906	73906	Troy	243	" What ? "
73889	73895	73999	73999	she	167	" The sword - exercise . "
73896	73904	73999	73999	she	167	" Ah ! would you like to ? "
74007	74019	73999	73999	she	167	" Yes ; I should like to see it very much . "
74020	74034	73999	73999	she	167	" And so you shall ; you shall see me go through it . "
74035	74040	73999	73999	she	167	" No ! How ? "
74041	74046	73999	73999	she	167	" Let me consider . "
74047	74070	74111	74111	Bathsheba	243	" Not with a walking - stick - I do n't care to see that . lt must be a real sword . "
74071	74102	74111	74111	Bathsheba	243	" Yes , I know ; and I have no sword here ; but I think I could get one by the evening . Now , will you do this ? "
74103	74109	74134	74134	Nobody	439	" O no , indeed ! "
74115	74129	74161	74161	I	0	" Thank you very much , but I could n't on any account . "
74138	74150	74178	74178	I	0	" She shook her head , but with a weakened negation . "
74156	74160	74183	74183	you	243	" she said , "
74171	74177	74168	74168	I	0	" Troy looked far away . "
74189	74236	74168	74168	I	0	" he said coldly . An unconscious look of assent in Bathsheba 's eyes betrayed that something more than his coldness had made her also feel that Liddy Would be superfluous in the suggested scene . She had felt it , even whilst making the proposal . "
74258	74262	74572	74572	I	0	" she added ; "
74268	74269	74582	74582	you	1701	" "
74277	74571	74752	74752	guards	1703	" said Troy . CHAPTER XXVIII THE HOLLOW AMID THE FERNS THE hill opposite Bathsheba 's dwelling extended , a mile off , into an uncultivated tract of land , dotted at this season with tall thickets of brake fern , plump and diaphanous from recent rapid growth , and radiant in hues of clear and untainted green . At eight o'clock this midsummer evening , whilst the bristling ball of gold in the west still swept the tips of the ferns with its long , luxuriant rays , a soft brushing- by of garments might have been heard among them , and Bathsheba appeared in their midst , their soft , feathery arms caressing her up to her shoulders . She paused , turned , went back over the hill and half - way to her own door , whence she cast a farewell glance upon the spot she had just left , having resolved not to remain near the place after all . She saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round the shoulder of the rise . It disappeared on the other side . She waited one minute - two minutes - thought of Troy 's disappointment at her non - fulfilment of a promised engagement , till she again ran along the field , clambered over the bank , and followed the original direction . She was now literally trembling and panting at this her temerity in such an errant undertaking ; her breath came and went quickly , and her eyes shone with an in- frequent light . Yet go she must . She reached the verge of a pit in the middle of the ferns . Troy stood in the bottom , looking up towards her . "
74584	74698	74794	74794	you	1701	" he said , coming up and giving her his hand to help her down the slope . The pit was a saucer - shaped concave , naturally formed , with a top diameter of about thirty feet , and shallow enough to allow the sunshine to reach their heads . Standing in the centre , the sky overhead was met by a circular horizon of fern : this grew nearly to the bottom of the slope and then abruptly ceased . The middle within the belt of verdure was floored with a thick flossy carpet of moss and grass intermingled , so yielding that the foot was half - buried within it . "
74701	74730	74794	74794	you	1701	" said Troy , producing the sword , which , as he raised it into the sunlight , gleamed a sort of greeting , like a living thing , "
74802	74824	74872	74880	one , two , three , four , right	1705	" Bathsheba saw a sort of rainbow , upside down in the air , and Troy 's arm was still again . "
74846	74859	74872	74880	one , two , three , four , right	1705	" Four , as if you were threshing - in that way . "
74892	74897	74872	74880	one , two , three , four , right	1705	" He repeated them . "
74902	74906	74962	74962	guards	1703	" he said . "
74912	74917	74962	74962	guards	1703	" She hurriedly interrupted : "
74941	74942	74962	74962	guards	1703	" "
74965	74971	74962	74962	guards	1703	" Troy duly exhibited them . "
74982	74990	74962	74962	guards	1703	" He gave the movements as before . "
75023	75024	75134	75134	she	0	" "
75030	75031	75205	75205	He	1701	" "
75125	75133	75296	75296	Troy	243	" I 'll be sure not to ! "
75178	75204	75320	75320	she	0	" Now just to learn whether you have pluck enough to let me do what I wish , I 'll give you a preliminary test . "
75304	75307	75320	75320	she	0	" recover swords "
75316	75319	75362	75362	Troy	243	" Oh ! "
75333	75352	75362	75362	Troy	243	" Have you run me through ? - no , you have not ! Whatever have you done ! "
75353	75360	75320	75320	she	0	" I have not touched you . "
75366	75417	75320	75320	she	0	" It was mere sleight of hand . The sword passed behind you . Now you are not afraid , are you ? Because if you are l ca n't perform . I give my word that l will not only not hurt you , but not once touch you . "
75418	75437	75362	75362	Troy	243	" I do n't think I am afraid . You are quite sure you will not hurt me ? "
75438	75442	75320	75320	she	0	" Quite sure . "
75443	75450	75788	75788	he	243	" Is the sWord very sharp ? "
75451	75465	75815	75815	I	0	" O no - only stand as still as a statue . Now ! "
75792	75812	75815	75815	I	0	" That outer loose lock of hair wants tidying , he said , before she had moved or spoken . "
75822	75845	75854	75854	You	1713	" An arc of silver shone on her right side : the sword had descended . The lock droped to the ground . "
75849	75853	75881	75881	you	1713	" said Troy . "
75868	75869	75881	75881	you	1713	" "
75887	75888	75906	75906	I	0	" "
75893	75894	75927	75927	I	0	" "
75909	75913	75927	75927	I	0	" she cried . "
75943	76008	75927	75927	I	0	" It appeared that a caterpillar had come from the fern and chosen the front of her bodice as his resting place . She saw the point glisten towards her bosom , and seemingly enter it . Bathsheba closed her eyes in the full persuasion that she was killed at last . How- ever , feeling just as usual , she opened them again . "
76015	76035	76090	76090	you	0	" said the sargeant , holding his sword before her eyes . The caterpillar was spitted upon its point . "
76042	76048	76090	76090	you	0	" said Bathsheba , amazed . "
76085	76086	76153	76153	you	0	" "
76106	76107	76153	76153	you	0	" "
76122	76151	76200	76200	me	0	" He touched the palm of his hand with the blade , and then , lifting it , showed her a thin shaving of scarf- skin dangling therefrom . "
76167	76168	76215	76215	I	0	" "
76210	76214	76237	76237	you	243	" She shuddered . "
76231	76232	76237	76237	you	243	" "
76256	76257	76277	76277	My	0	" "
76267	76268	76277	76277	My	0	" "
76282	76315	76330	76330	I	0	" And Troy returned the weapon to the scabbard . Bathsheba , overcome by a hundred tumultuous feel- ings resulting from the scene , abstractedly sat down on a tuft of heather . "
76322	76328	76974	76974	Troy	243	" said Troy , softly . "
76343	76435	77049	77049	she	459	" She saw him stoop to the grass , pick up the winding lock which he had severed from her manifold tresses , twist it round his fingers , unfasten a button in the breast of his coat , and carefully put it inside . She felt power- less to withstand or deny him . He was altogether too much for her , and Bathsheba seemed as one who , facing a reviving wind , finds it blow so strongly that it stops the breath . He drew near and said , "
76442	76972	77323	77323	she	4518	" He drew nearer still . A minute later and she saw his scarlet form disappear amid the ferny thicket , almost in a flash , like a brand swiftly waved . That minute 's interval had brought the blood beating into her face , set her stinging as if aflame to the very hollows of her feet , and enlarged emotion to a compass which quite swamped thought . It had brought upon her a stroke resulting , as did that of Moses in Horeh , in a liquid stream - here a stream of tears . She felt like one who has sinned a great sin . The circumstance had been the gentle dip of Troy 's mouth downwards upon her own . He had kissed her . CHAPTER XXIX PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK WE now see the element of folly distinctly mingling with the many varying particulars which made up the character of Bathsheba Everdene . It was almost foreign to her intrinsic nature . Introduced as lymph on the dart of Eros , it eventually permeated and coloured her whole constitution . Bathsheba , though she had too much understanding to be entirely governed by her womanliness , had too much womanliness to use her understanding to the best advantage . Perhaps in no minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more than in the strange power she possesses of believing cajoleries that she knows to be false - except , indeed , in that of being utterly sceptical on strictures that she knows to be true . Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self - reliant women love when they abandon their self - reliance . When a strong woman recklessly throws away her strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never had any strength to throw away . One source of her inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion . She has never had practice in making the best of such a condition . Weakness is doubly weak by being new . Bathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter . Though in one sense a woman of the world , it was , after all , that world of daylight coteries and green carpets wherein cattle form the passing crowd and winds the busy hum ; where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives on the other side of your party - wall , where your neigh- bour is everybody in the tything , and where calculation formulated self - indulgence of bad , nothing at all . Had her utmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly worded and by herself they never were , they would only have amounted to such a matter as that she felt her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her discretion . Her love was entire as a child 's , and though warm as summer it was fresh as spring . Her culpability lay in her making no attempt to control feeling by subtle and careful inquiry into consciences . She could show others the steep and thorny way , but ' reck'd not her own rede , "
77058	77060	77323	77323	she	4518	" Troy "
77315	77322	77357	77357	Oak	144	" Oh , is it Gabriel ? "
77326	77338	77366	77366	she	4518	" You are taking a walk too . Good - night . "
77339	77355	77323	77323	she	4518	" I thought I would come to meet you , as it is rather late , "
77374	77387	77366	77366	she	4518	" Thank you , indeed , but I am not very fearful . "
77388	77399	77323	77323	she	4518	" O no ; but there are bad characters about . "
77400	77406	77499	77499	he	144	" I never meet them . "
77426	77430	77499	77499	he	144	" bad characters . "
77465	77498	77541	77541	she	4518	" And as the man who would naturally come to meet you is away from home , too - I mean Farmer Boldwood - why , thinks I , I 'll go . "
77502	77507	77598	77598	They	1727	" Ah , yes . "
77546	77567	77621	77621	Gabriel	144	" I do n't quite understand what you meant by saying that Mr. Boldwood would naturally come to meet me . "
77596	77597	77642	77642	he	144	" "
77605	77620	77642	77642	he	144	" she returned quickly . No marriage is likely to take place between us . "
77635	77641	77715	77715	she	1011	" Well , Miss Everdene . "
77645	77669	77715	77715	she	1011	" putting aside what people say , I never in my life saw any courting if his is not a courting of you . "
77706	77714	77821	77821	they	1729	" Since this subject has been mentioned . "
77720	77802	77821	77821	they	1729	" I am glad of the opportunity of clearing up a mistake which is very common and very provoking . I did n't definitely promise Mr. Boldwood anything . I have never cared for him . I respect him , and he has urged me to marry him . But I have given him no distinct answer . As soon as he returns I shall do so ; and the answer will be that I can not think of marrying him . "
77803	77812	77839	77839	they	1729	" People are full of mistakes , seemingly . "
77813	77817	77877	77877	They	1729	" They are . "
77855	77865	77924	77924	I	0	" That I am , I suppose you mean . "
77866	77876	77930	77933	that young Sergeant Troy	243	" Well , I hope they speak the truth . "
77902	77923	77930	77933	that young Sergeant Troy	243	" Oak was unfortunately led on to speak of Boldwood 's rival in a wrong tone to her after all . "
77937	77948	77956	77956	He	243	" he sighed . Bathsheba 's steps became faintly spasmodic . "
77951	77955	77981	77981	Nobody	439	" she asked . "
77965	77966	77981	77981	Nobody	439	" "
77979	77980	77993	77994	Sergeant Troy	243	" "
77985	77986	78027	78027	He	243	" "
78001	78007	78067	78067	I	0	" she said , intractably . "
78032	78033	78106	78106	him	243	" "
78065	78066	78199	78199	I	0	" "
78102	78103	78199	78199	I	0	" "
78208	78209	78235	78235	His	243	" "
78214	78215	78283	78283	you	1740	" "
78228	78234	78283	78283	you	1740	" he said , sturdily . "
78276	78280	78283	78283	you	1740	" Good day , "
78322	78327	78283	78283	you	1740	" that fantastical man . "
78329	78338	78422	78422	I	0	" that Sergeant What's - his - name . "
78339	78352	78447	78447	his	243	" That man of a family that has come to the dogs . "
78373	78421	78447	78447	his	243	" No Christmas robin detained by a window - pane ever pulsed as did Bathsheba now . I say - I say again - that it does n't become you to talk about him . Why he should be mentioned passes me quite . she exclaimed desperately . "
78456	78457	78472	78472	He	243	" "
78460	78461	78499	78499	I	0	" "
78489	78490	78499	78499	I	0	" "
78504	78505	78544	78544	He	243	" "
78512	78517	78804	78804	ye	1756	" she said eagerly , "
78549	78639	78804	78804	ye	1756	" This supreme instance of Troy 's goodness fell upon Gabriel ears like the thirteenth stroke of crazy clock . It was not only received with utter incredulity as re- garded itself , but threw a doubt on all the assurances that had preceded it . Oak was grieved to find how entirely she trusted him . He brimmed with deep feeling as he replied in a steady voice , the steadiness of which was spoilt by the palpable- ness of his great effort to keep it so : - "
78782	78783	78804	78804	ye	1756	" "
78793	78802	78931	78931	I	0	" she exclaimed , in a choking voice . "
78818	78823	78931	78931	I	0	" he went on . "
78874	78930	78973	78973	I	0	" Oak 's allusion to his own love for her lessened , to some extent , her anger at his interference ; but she could not really forgive him for letting his wish to marry her be eclipsed by his wish to do her good , any more than for his slighting treatment of Troy . "
78938	78957	78973	78973	I	0	" she commanded , a paleness of face invisible to the eye being suggested by the trembling words . "
78979	78980	78997	78997	you	224	" "
78985	78991	79044	79044	you	224	" said Oak , calmly . "
79013	79014	79134	79134	I	0	" "
79035	79036	79150	79151	no bailiff	4054	" "
79145	79146	79362	79362	she	1776	" "
79162	79167	79407	79407	She	1776	" she said decisively . "
79205	79355	79460	79460	Gabriel	144	" ee to feel you owe me anything . Not I. What I do , I do . Sometimes I say I should be as glad as a bird to leave the place - for do n't suppose I 'm content to be a nobody . I was made for better things . However , I do n't like to see your concerns going to ruin , as they must if you keep in this mind .... I hate taking my own measure so plain , but , upon my life , your provok- ing ways make a man say what he would n't dream of at other times ! I own to being rather interfering . But you know well enough how it is , and who she is that I like too well , and feel too much like a fool about to be civil to her ! "
79412	79449	80115	80115	Troy	243	" Will you leave me alone now ? I do n't order it as a mistress - I ask it as a woman , and I expect you not to be so uncourteous as to refuse . "
79450	79458	80097	80097	She	1776	" Certainly I will , Miss Everdene . "
80122	80134	80168	80168	Bathsheba	243	" If he marry her , she 'll gie up farming . "
80135	80154	80220	80220	she	1776	" Twill be a gallant life , but may bring some trouble between the mirth - so say I. "
80155	80167	80233	80233	Liddy	191	" Well , I wish I had half such a husband . "
80212	80219	80302	80305	the froward young person	1798	" Who are you speaking of ? "
80237	80252	80233	80233	Liddy	191	" What was passing was a bit of a word about yourself , miss . "
80253	80300	80322	80322	Liddy	191	" I thought so ! Maryann and Liddy and Temper- ance - now I forbid you to suppose such things . You know I do n't care the least for Mr. Troy - not I. Every- body knows how much I hate him . - Yes . "
80307	80311	80322	80322	Liddy	191	" HATE him ! "
80312	80320	80340	80340	Maryann	179	" We know you do , miss . "
80324	80331	80360	80360	Bathsheba	243	" and so do we all . "
80332	80338	80360	80360	Bathsheba	243	" I hate him too . "
80342	80358	80233	80233	Liddy	191	" Maryann - O you perjured woman ! How can you speak that wicked story ! "
80364	80390	80506	80506	She	1799	" You admired him from your heart only this morning in the very world , you did . Yes , Maryann , you know it ! "
80391	80416	80536	80537	mild Liddy	191	" Yes , miss , but so did you . He is a wild scamp now , and you are right to hate him . "
80417	80505	80536	80537	mild Liddy	191	" He 's NOT a wild scamp ! How dare you to my face ! I have no right to hate him , nor you , nor anybody . But I am a silly woman ! What is it to me what he is ? You know it is nothing . I do n't care for him ; I do n't mean to defend his good name , not I. Mind this , if any of you say a word against him you 'll be dismissed instantly ! "
80530	80534	80579	80579	Liddy	191	" O miss ! "
80546	80570	80579	80579	Liddy	191	" I am sorry we mistook you so ! did think you cared for him ; but I see you do n't now . "
80571	80578	80629	80629	Bathsheba	243	" Shut the door , Liddy . "
80588	80603	80629	80629	Bathsheba	243	" People always say such foolery , miss . I 'll make answer hencefor'ard , "
80616	80628	80682	80682	she	1803	" I 'll say it out in plain black and white . "
80633	80660	80729	80729	She	1803	" O Liddy , are you such a simpleton ? Ca n't you read riddles ? Ca n't you see ? Are you a woman yourself ? "
80669	80681	80731	80731	her	1803	" Yes ; you must be a blind thing , Liddy ! "
80691	80728	80826	80826	Liddy	191	" O , I love him to very distraction and misery and agony ! Do n't be frightened at me , though perhaps I am enough to frighten any innocent woman . Come closer - closer . "
80738	80825	80731	80731	her	1803	" I must let it out to somebody ; it is wearing me away ! Do n't you yet know enough of me to see through that miserable denial of mine ? O God , what a lie it was ! Heaven and my Love forgive me . And do n't you know that a woman who loves at all thinks nothing of perjury when it is balanced against her love ? There , go out of the room ; I want to be quite alone . "
80832	80860	80924	80924	She	1804	" Liddy , come here . Solemnly swear to me that he 's not a fast man ; that it is all lies they say about him ! "
80861	80876	80956	80956	Liddy	191	" Put , miss , how can I say he is not if - - "
80877	80923	80992	80992	you	191	" You graceless girl ! How can you have the cruel heart to repeat what they say ? Unfeeling thing that you are .... But I'LL see if you or anybody else in the village , or town either , dare do such a thing ! "
80938	80954	80992	80992	you	191	" No , miss . I do n't - I know it is not true ! "
80995	80996	81006	81006	you	191	" "
81003	81004	81015	81015	I	0	" "

81025	81034	81067	81067	you	191	" said Liddy , be- ginning to cry . "

81107	81124	81230	81230	I	0	" she moaned , in a relaxed , desultory way , heedless of Liddy 's presence . "
81170	81179	81230	81230	I	0	" She freshened and turned to Liddy suddenly . "
81228	81229	81286	81286	I	0	" "
81238	81250	81286	81286	I	0	" said Liddy , with womanly dignity of a diminutive order ; "
81303	81311	81431	81431	I	0	" concluded the small woman , bigly . "
81322	81335	81472	81472	I	0	" said Bathsheba , dropping from haughtiness to entreaty with capricious inconsequence . "
81429	81430	81484	81484	you	309	" "
81443	81471	81522	81522	I	0	" sobbed Liddy , impulsively putting up her lips to Bathsheba 's , and kissing her . Then Bathsheba kissed Liddy , and all was smooth again . "
81493	81504	81522	81522	I	0	" she said , a smile shining through the moisture . "
81520	81521	81630	81630	Liddy	191	" "

81598	81628	81630	81630	Liddy	191	thing!"Death 's head himself sha n't wring it from me , mistress , if I 've a mind to keep anything ; and I 'll always be your friend . "
81680	81695	81630	81630	Liddy	191	" I think God likes us to be good friends , do n't you ? "
81696	81701	81771	81771	Bathsheba	243	" Indeed I do . "
81702	81762	81802	81802	she	1821	" And , dear miss , you wo n't harry me and storm at me , will you ? because you seem to swell so tall as a lion then , and it frightens me ! Do you know , I fancy you would be a match for any man when you are in one O ' your takings . "
81763	81769	81833	81833	she	1821	" Never ! do you ? "
81787	81801	81833	81833	she	1821	" I hope I am not a bold sort of maid - mannish ? "
81808	81832	82435	82435	she	1837	" O no , not mannish ; but so almighty womanish that ' tis getting on that way sometimes . Ah ! miss . "
81851	81876	82525	82525	he	224	" I wish I had half your failing that way . ' Tis a great protection to a poor maid in these illegit'mate days ! "
82424	82434	82540	82540	you	224	" Oh ; is it you , Mr. Boldwood ? "
82528	82537	82551	82551	you	1837	" What , are you afraid of me ? "
82544	82548	82600	82600	Boldwood	224	" said Bathsheba . "
82555	82559	82600	82600	Boldwood	224	" said he . "
82590	82598	82634	82634	she	1837	" You know what that feeling is . "
82604	82620	82634	82634	she	1837	" A thing strong as death . No dismissal by a hasty letter affects that . "
82621	82633	82702	82702	Bathsheba	243	" I wish you did not feel so strongly about me . "
82637	82658	82724	82724	Boldwood	224	" It is generous of you , and more than I deserve , but I must not hear it now . "
82659	82701	82724	82724	Boldwood	224	" Hear it ? What do you think I have to say , then ? I am not to marry you , and that 's enough . Your letter was excellently plain . I want you to hear nothing - not I. "
82733	82743	82761	82761	Boldwood	224	" Bathsheba - darling - is it final indeed ? "
82744	82749	82761	82761	Boldwood	224	" Indeed it is . "
82750	82760	82761	82761	Boldwood	224	" O , Bathsheba - have pity upon me ! "
82765	82799	82885	82885	he	224	" God 's sake , yes - I am come to that low , lowest stage - to ask a woman for pity ! Still , she is you - she is you . "
82821	82833	82885	82885	he	224	" There is little honour to the woman in that speech . "
82872	82884	82971	82971	she	1842	" I am beyond myself about this , and am mad . "
82888	82943	82976	82976	she	1842	" I am no stoic at all to he supplicating here ; but I do supplicate to you . I wish you knew what is in me of devotion to you ; but it is impossible , that . In bare human mercy to a lonely man , do n't throw me off now ! "
82944	82963	82885	82885	he	224	" I do n't throw you off - indeed , how can I ? I never had you . "
82990	83110	83539	83539	her	1843	" But there was a time when you turned to me , before I thought of you ! I do n't reproach you , for even now I feel that the ignorant and cold darkness that I should have lived in if you had not attracted me by that letter - valentine you call it - would have been worse than my knowledge of you , though it has brought this misery . But , I say , there was a time when I knew nothing of you , and cared nothing for you , and yet you drew me on . And if you say you gave me no en- couragement , I can not but contradict you . "
83111	83149	83381	83381	she	1843	" What you call encouragement was the childish game of an idle minute . I have bitterly repented of it - ay , bitterly , and in tears . Can you still go on re- minding me ? "
83150	83366	83381	83381	she	1843	" I do n't accuse you of it - I deplore it . I took for earnest what you insist was jest , and now this that I pray to be jest you say is awful , wretched earnest . Our moods meet at wrong places . I wish your feeling was more like mine , or my feeling more like yours ! O , could I but have foreseen the torture that trifling trick was going to lead me into , how I should have cursed you ; but only having been able to see it since , I can not do that , for I love you too well ! But it is weak , idle drivelling to go on like this .... Bathsheba , you are the first woman of any shade or nature that I have ever looked at to love , and it is the having been so near claiming you for my own that makes this denial so hard to bear . How nearly you promised me ! But I do n't speak now to move your heart , and make you grieve because of my pain ; it is no use , that . I must bear it ; my pain would get no less by paining you . "
83367	83380	83539	83539	her	1843	" But I do pity you - deeply - O so deeply ! "
83385	83522	83539	83539	her	1843	" Do no such thing - do no such thing . Your dear love , Bathsheba , is such a vast thing beside your pity , that the loss of your pity as well as your love is no great addition to my sorrow , nor does the gain of your pity make it sensibly less . O sweet - how dearly you spoke to me behind the spear - bed at the washing - pool , and in the barn at the shearing , and that dearest last time in the evening at your home ! Where are your pleasant words all gone - your earnest hope to be able to love me ? Where is your firm conviction that you would get to care for me very much ? Really forgotten ? - really ? "
83545	83652	83836	83836	she	1845	" Mr. Bold- wood , I promised you nothing . Would you have had me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest , highest compliment a man can pay a woman - telling her he loves her ? I was bound to show some feeling , if l would not be a graceless shrew . Yet each of those pleasures was just for the day - the day just for the pleasure . How was I to know that what is a pastime to all other men was death to you ? Have reason , do , and think more kindly of me ! "
83653	83744	83836	83836	she	1845	" Well , never mind arguing - never mind . One thing is sure : you were all but mine , and now you are not nearly mine . Everything is changed , and that by you alone , remember . You were nothing to me once , and I was contented ; you are now nothing to me again , and how different the second nothing is from the first ! Would to God you had never taken me up , since it was only to throw me down ! "
83822	83835	83980	83980	She	1848	" I did not take you up - surely I did not ! "
83844	83891	84024	84024	his	1849	" But do n't be in this mood with me . I can endure being told I am in the wrong , if you will only tell it me gently ! O sir , will you not kindly forgive me , and look at it cheerfully ? "
83892	83979	84148	84148	He	1849	" Cheerfully ! Can a man fooled to utter heart- burning find a reason for being merry If I have lost , how can I be as if I had won ? Heavens you must be heartless quite ! Had I known what a fearfully bitter sweet this was to be , how would I have avoided you , and never seen you , and been deaf of you . I tell you all this , but what do you care ! You do n't care . "
84032	84095	84148	84148	He	1849	" Dearest , dearest , I am wavering even now between the two opposites of recklessly renouncing you , and labouring humbly for you again . Forget that you have said No , and let it be as it was ! Say , Bathsheba , that you only wrote that refusal to me in fun - come , say it to me ! "
84096	84147	84302	84302	he	1849	" It would be untrue , and painful to both of us . You overrate my capacity for love . I do n't possess half the warmth of nature you believe me to have . An un- protected childhood in a cold world has beaten gentle- ness out of me . "
84155	84249	84302	84302	he	1849	" That may be true , somewhat ; but ah , Miss Everdene , it wo n't do as a reason ! You are not the cold woman you would have me believe . No , no ! It is n't because you have no feeling in you that you do n't love me . You naturally would have me think so - you would hide from that you have a burning heart like mine . You have love enough , but it is turned into a new channel . I know where . "
84291	84301	84386	84386	she	1852	" Why did Troy not leave my treasure alone ? "
84307	84365	84386	84386	she	1852	" When I had no thought of injuring him , why did he force himself upon your notice ! Before he worried you your inclination was to have me ; when next I should have come to you your answer would have been Yes . Can you deny it - I ask , can you deny it ? "
84380	84385	84617	84617	she	1854	" I can not . "
84389	84489	84600	84600	His	1853	" I know you can not . But he stole in in my absence and robbed me . Why did't he win you away before , when nobody would have been grieved ? - when nobody would have been set tale - bearing . Now the people sneer at me - the very hills and sky seem to laugh at me till I blush shamefuly for my folly . I have lost my respect , my good name , my standing - lost it , never to get it again . Go and marry your man - go on ! "
84490	84497	84617	84617	she	1854	" O sir - Mr. Boldwood ! "
84498	84599	84674	84674	She	1854	" You may as well . I have no further claim upon you . As for me , I had better go somewhere alone , and hide - and pray . I loved a woman once . I am now ashamed . When I am dead they 'll say , Miserable love - sick man that he was . Heaven - heaven - if I had got jilted secretly , and the dishonour not known , and my position kept ! But no matter , it is gone , and the woman not gained . Shame upon him - shame ! "
84620	84634	84690	84690	she	1854	" I am only a girl - do not speak to me so ! "
84635	84673	84690	84690	she	1854	" All the time you knew - how very well you knew - that your new freak was my misery . Dazzled by brass and scarlet - O , Bathsheba - this is woman 's folly indeed ! "
84680	84689	84767	84767	Boldwood	224	" You are taking too much upon yourself ! "
84695	84751	84767	84767	Boldwood	224	" Everybody is upon me - everybody . It is unmanly to attack a woman so ! I have nobody in the world to fight my battles for me ; but no mercy is shown . Yet if a thousand of you sneer and say things against me , I WILL NOT be put down ! "
84752	84766	84853	84853	She	1855	" You 'll chatter with him doubtless about me . Say to him , "
84774	84817	84848	84848	Bathsheba	243	" Yes , and you have given way to him , knowing him to be not the man for you . He has kissed you - claimed you as his . Do you hear - he has kissed you . Deny it ! "
84856	84876	84853	84853	She	1855	" Leave me , sir - leave me ! I am nothing to you . Let me go on ! "
84877	84885	84903	84904	the farmer	3540	" Deny that he has kissed you . "
84886	84891	84911	84911	she	1855	" I shall not . "
84892	84899	84911	84911	she	1855	" Ha - then he has ! "
84906	84910	84948	84948	Boldwood	224	" He has , "
84926	84936	84948	84948	Boldwood	224	" I am not ashamed to speak the truth . "
84937	84946	85059	85059	she	1855	" Then curse him ; and curse him ! "
84956	85040	85059	85059	she	1855	" Whilst I would have given worlds to touch your hand , you have let a rake come in without right or ceremony and - kiss you ! Heaven 's mercy - kiss you ! ... Ah , a time of his life shall come when he will have to repent , and think wretchedly of the pain he has caused another man ; and then may he ache , and wish , and curse , and yearn - as I do now ! "
85041	85058	85177	85177	He	224	" Do n't , do n't , O , do n't pray down evil upon him ! "
85066	85088	85179	85179	his	224	" Anything but that - anything . O , be kind to him , sir , for I love him true . "
85125	85176	86273	86273	Gabriel	144	" I 'll punish him - by my soul , that will I ! I 'll meet him , soldier or no , and I 'll horsewhip the untimely stripling for this reckless theft of my one delight . If he were a hundred men I 'd horsewhip him - - "
85185	85305	86320	86320	Jan.	198	" Bath- sheba , sweet , lost coquette , pardon me ! I 've been blaming you , threatening you , behaving like a churl to you , when he 's the greatest sinner . He stole your dear heart away with his unfathomable lies ! ... lt is a fortunate thing for him that he 's gone back to his regiment - that he 's away up the country , and not here ! I hope he may not return here just yet . I pray God he may not come into my sight , for I may be tempted beyond myself . O , Bathsheba , keep him away - yes , keep him away from me ! "
86268	86271	86340	86340	Maryann	179	" Hark ! "
86306	86318	86340	86340	Maryann	179	" That 's our Dainty - i'll swear to her step . "
86321	86338	86372	86372	Gabriel	144	" Mighty me ! Wo n't mis'ess storm and call us stupids wen she comes back ! "
86342	86363	86394	86394	Faith	310	" How I wish it had happened when she was at home , and none of us had been answerable ! "
86364	86370	86396	86396	I	0	" We must ride after . "
86392	86393	86436	86436	we	1900	" "
86402	86406	86448	86449	Mr Boldwood	224	" said Coggan . "

86466	86480	86481	86482	Farmer Boldwood	231	" said Gabriel . He ran down the hill towards Farmer Boldwood 's . "
86488	86492	86502	86502	I	0	" said Maryann . "
86497	86501	86537	86537	you	0	" said Coggan . "
86510	86534	86563	86563	I	0	" Less than five minutes brought up Oak again , running at the same pace , with two halters dangling from his hand . "
86541	86558	86599	86600	a hero	1906	" said Coggan , turning round and leaping upon the hedge without waiting for an answer . "
86570	86577	86599	86600	a hero	1906	" said Gabriel , following him . "
86596	86597	86779	86780	The villains	1907	" "
86602	86605	86779	86780	The villains	1907	" said Jan. "
86613	86778	86793	86793	I	0	" Gabriel shouted to her from the top of the hedge . Springing down into Boldwood 's pastures , each pocketed his halter to hide it from the horses , who , seeing the men empty - handed , docilely allowed them- selves to he seized by the mane , when the halters were dexterously slipped on . Having neither bit nor bridle , Oak and Coggan extemporized the former by passing the rope in each case through the animal 's mouth and looping it on the other side . Oak vaulted astride , and Coggan clambered up by aid of the hank , when they ascended to the gate and galloped off in the direction taken by Bathsheha 's horse and the robber . Whose vehicle the horse had been harnessed to was a matter of some uncertainty . Weatherbury Bottom was reached in three or four minutes . They scanned the shady green patch by the roadside . The gipsies were gone . "
86782	86786	86793	86793	I	0	" said Gabriel . "

86865	86871	87035	87035	Jan	285	" What 's the matter ? "
86875	86890	87035	87035	Jan	285	" We must try to track 'em , since we ca n't hear 'em , "
87030	87034	87076	87078	Old Jimmy Harris	313	" Straight on ! "
87038	87068	87086	87086	I	0	" Tracks like that mean a stiff gallop . No wonder we do n't hear him . And the horse is harnessed - look at the ruts . Ay , "
87074	87075	87117	87117	Oak	144	" "

87119	87128	87186	87186	he	180	" You saw there were no other tracks ? "
87129	87132	87186	87186	he	180	" True . "
87178	87185	87277	87277	Gabriel	144	" ' Tis a canter now . "
87194	87221	87287	87287	Coggan	180	" A twisty , rickety pace for a gig . The fact is , they over- drove her at starting , we shall catch 'em yet . "
87266	87275	87287	87287	Coggan	180	" That 's a trot , I know . "
87279	87285	87319	87319	Jan.	198	" Only a trot now . "
87291	87299	87319	87319	Jan.	198	" We shall overtake him in time . "
87311	87317	87319	87319	Jan.	198	" Ah ! a moment . "
87320	87332	87363	87363	She	1919	" Let 's see how she was driven up this hill . "
87337	87355	87373	87373	We	1915	" A light was promptly struck upon his gaiters as before , and the ex- amination made , "
87358	87362	87373	87373	We	1915	" said Coggan . "
87385	87462	87373	87373	We	1915	" They rode three , and listened . No sound was to be heard save a millpond trickling hoarsely through a hatch , and suggesting gloomy possibilities of drowning by jumping in . Gabriel dismounted when they came to a turning . The tracks were absolutely the only guide as to the direction that they now had , and great caution was necessary to avoid confusing them with some others which had made their appearance lately . "
87473	87543	87373	87373	We	1915	" said Gabriel , looking up at Coggan as he moved the match over the ground about the turning . Coggan , who , no less than the panting horses , had latterly shown signs of weariness , again scrutinized the mystic characters . This time only three were of the regular horseshoe shape . Every fourth was a dot . He screwed up his face and emitted a long "
87550	87551	87582	87582	We	1915	" "
87554	87558	87582	87582	We	1915	" said Oak . "
87571	87581	87643	87643	We	1915	" said Coggan slowly staring still at the footprints . "
87587	87642	87582	87582	We	1915	" said Gabriel , remounting his humid steed . Although the road along its greater part had been as good as any turnpike - road in the country , it was nomin- ally only a byway . The last turning had brought them into the high road leading to Bath . Coggan recollected himself . "
87649	87653	87874	87877	the turnpike - man	1924	" he exclaimed . "
87656	87657	87874	87877	the turnpike - man	1924	" "
87707	87734	87874	87877	the turnpike - man	1924	" ' Twas said until , against a shady background of foliage , five white bars were visible , crossing their route a little way ahead . "
87742	87746	87874	87877	the turnpike - man	1924	" said Gabriel . "
87753	87790	87863	87863	He	1921	" said Coggan . The white bars were blotted out in the midst by a dark shape in front of them . The silence of this lonely time was pierced by an exclamation from that quarter . "
87799	87852	87874	87877	the turnpike - man	1924	" It appeared that there had been a previous call which they had not noticed , for on their close approach the door of the turnpike - house opened , and the keeper came out half - dressed , with a candle in his hand . The rays illumined the whole group . "
87858	87862	87938	87938	he	180	" shouted Gabriel . "
87869	87872	87984	87984	she	459	" Who ? "
87925	87937	87984	87984	she	459	" Why , ' tis mistress - i'll take my oath ! "
87978	87983	88002	88002	Gabriel	144	" Well , Gabriel . "
87988	87994	88008	88008	she	459	" where are you going ? "
87995	88000	88008	88008	she	459	" We thought - - "
88004	88007	88013	88013	her	459	" Bath . "
88022	88054	88013	88013	her	459	" An important matter made it necessary for me to give up my visit to liddy , and go off at once . What , then , were you following me ? "
88055	88063	88008	88008	she	459	" We thought the horse was stole . "
88064	88140	88013	88013	her	459	" Well - what a thing ! How very foolish of you not to know that I had taken the trap and horse . I could neither wake Maryann nor get into the house , though I hammered for ten minutes against her window - sill . Fortunately , I could get the key of the coach - house , so I troubled no one further . Did n't you think it might be me ? "
88141	88148	88008	88008	she	459	" Why should we , miss ? "
88149	88198	88008	88008	she	459	" Perhaps not Why , those are never Farmer Bold- wood 's horses ! Goodness mercy ! what have you been doing bringing trouble upon me in this way ? What ! must n't a lady move an inch from her door without being dogged like a thief ? "
88199	88216	88351	88351	She	1929	" But how was we to know , if you left no account of your doings ? "
88220	88239	88351	88351	She	1929	" and ladies do n't drive at these hours , miss , as a jineral rule of society . "
88240	88293	88318	88318	she	1929	" I did leave an account - and you would have seen it in the morning . I wrote in chalk on the coach - house doors that I had come back for the horse and gig , and driven off ; that I could arouse nobody , and should return soon . "
88294	88313	88351	88351	She	1929	" But you 'll consider , ma'am , that we could n't see that till it got daylight . "
88314	88317	88397	88397	Coggan	180	" True . "
88359	88387	88397	88397	Coggan	180	" Well , I really thank you heartily for taking all this trouble ; but I wish you had borrowed anybody 's horses but Mr. Boldwood 's . "
88388	88395	88453	88453	She	1929	" Dainty is lame , miss . "
88399	88405	88538	88538	Coggan	180	" Can ye go on ? "
88406	88452	88547	88547	Gabriel	144	" lt was only a stone in her shoe . I got down and pulled it out a hundred yards back . I can manage very well , thank you . I shall be in Bath by daylight . Will you now return , please ? "
88521	88536	88547	88547	Gabriel	144	" A strange vagary , this of hers , is n't it , Oak ? "
88542	88545	88538	88538	Coggan	180	" Yes . "
88551	88562	88547	88547	Gabriel	144	" She wo n't be in Bath by no daylight ! "
88563	88579	88547	88547	Gabriel	144	" Coggan , suppose we keep this night 's work as quiet as we can ? "
88580	88590	89531	89531	he	180	" I am of one and the same mind . "
88591	88614	89545	89545	Maryann	266	" Very well . We shall be home by three o'clock or so , and can creep into the parish like lambs . "
89523	89530	89545	89545	Maryann	266	" I wonder who that is ? "
89534	89543	89623	89623	Gabriel	144	" I hope nothing is wrong about mistress . "
89564	89614	89683	89684	Matthew Moon	181	" but an unlucky token came to me indoors this morning . l went to unlock the door and dropped the key , and it fell upon the stone floor and broke into two pieces . Breaking a key is a dreadful bodement . I wish mis'ess was home . "
89615	89621	89683	89684	Matthew Moon	181	" ' Tis Cain Ball . "
89671	89681	89738	89739	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" He 's dressed up in his best clothes . "
89686	89724	89840	89841	Jan Coggan	180	" He hev been away from home for a few days , since he 's had that felon upon his finger ; for ' a said , since I ca n't work I 'll have a hollerday . "
89725	89736	89840	89841	Jan Coggan	180	" A good time for one - a excellent time . "
89795	89818	89939	89939	Gabriel	144	" Twas a bad leg allowed me to read the Pilgrim 's Progress , and Mark Clark learnt AliFours in a whitlow . "
89819	89838	89939	89939	Gabriel	144	" Ay , and my father put his arm out of joint to have time to go courting . "
89932	89937	89990	89990	Cain	235	" Now , Cainy ! "
89943	89980	89990	89990	Cain	235	" How many more times must I tell you to keep from running so fast when you be eating ? You 'll choke yourself some day , that 's what you 'll do , Cain Ball . "
89981	89988	90109	90109	he	1962	" Hok - hok - hok ! "
89992	90043	90109	90109	he	1962	" A crumb of my victuals went the wrong way - hok - hok ! , That 's what ' tis , Mister Oak ! And I 've been visiting to Bath because I had a felon on my thumb ; yes , and l've seen - ahok - hok ! "
90105	90108	90154	90154	Gabriel	144	" Yes . "
90123	90146	90154	90154	Gabriel	144	" l've seed the world at last - yes - and I 've seed our mis'ess - ahok - hok - hok ! "
90147	90152	90109	90109	he	1962	" Bother the boy ! "
90156	90181	90109	90109	he	1962	" Something is always going the wrong way down your throat , so that you ca n't tell what 's necessary to be told . "
90182	90207	90246	90247	Matthew Moon	181	" Ahok ! there ! Please , Mister Oak , a gnat have just fleed into my stomach and brought the cough on again ! "
90208	90226	90260	90260	Gabriel	144	" Yes , that 's just it . Your mouth is always open , you young rascal ! "
90227	90244	90270	90272	the junior shepherd	4267	" ' Tis terrible bad to have a gnat fly down yer throat , pore boy ! "
90249	90258	90270	90272	the junior shepherd	4267	" Well , at Bath you saw - - "
90262	90268	90336	90337	their informant	1966	" I saw our mistress . "
90274	90319	90378	90378	Gabriel	144	" and a sojer , walking along . And bymeby they got closer and closer , and then they went arm - in - crook , like courting complete - hok - hok ! like courting complete - hok ! - courting complete - - "
90351	90370	90397	90398	Cain Ball	235	" Well , I see our mis'ess and a soldier - a - ha - a - wk ! "
90371	90376	90493	90493	I	0	" Damn the boy ! "
90380	90395	90493	90493	I	0	" ' Tis only my manner , Mister Oak , if ye'll excuse it , "
90427	90487	90518	90518	you	1968	" said Jan Coggan , lifting a flagon of cider , pulling out the cork , and applying the hole to Cainy 's mouth ; Joseph Poorgrass in the meantime beginning to think apprehensively of the serious consequences that would follow Cainy Ball 's strangulation in his cough , and the history of his Bath adventures dying with him . "
90496	90499	90520	90521	Cain Ball	235	" please God "
90505	90514	90652	90652	Coggan	180	" said Joseph , in an unboastful voice ; "
90523	90543	90669	90669	Cainy	252	" ' Tis a great safeguard , and might perhaps save you from being choked to death some day . "
90630	90650	90669	90669	Cainy	252	" There 's a great clumsy sneeze ! Why ca n't ye have better manners , you young dog ! "
90659	90667	90719	90720	Matthew Moon	181	" The cider went up my nose ! "
90678	90706	90719	90720	Matthew Moon	181	" and now ' tis gone down my neck , and into my poor dumb felon , and over my shiny buttons and all my best cloze ! "
90707	90717	90747	90747	Cain	235	" The poor lad 's cough is terrible unfortunate . "
90722	90738	90747	90747	Cain	235	" And a great history on hand , too . Bump his back , shepherd . "
90739	90745	90775	90776	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" ' Tis my nater . "
90749	90767	90775	90776	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" Mother says I always was so excitable when my feelings were worked up to a point ! "
90768	90773	90845	90845	Coggan	180	" True , true . "
90778	90834	90845	90845	Coggan	180	" The Balls were always a very excitable family . I knowed the boy 's grandfather - a truly nervous and modest man , even to genteel refinery . ' Twas blush , blush with him , almost as much as ' tis with me - not but that ' tis a fault in me ! "
90835	90843	90878	90878	Poorgrass	177	" Not at all , Master Poorgrass . "
90847	90857	90878	90878	Poorgrass	177	" ' Tis a very noble quality in ye . "
90858	90876	90994	90994	Cainy	252	" Heh - heh ! well , I wish to noise nothing abroad - nothing at all . "
90882	90946	90998	91001	a very clever man	1975	" But we be born to things - that 's true . Yet I would rather my trifle were hid ; though , perhaps , a high nater is a little high , and at my birth all things were possible to my Maker , and he may have begrudged no gifts .... But under your bushel , Joseph ! under your bushel with "
90992	90993	91172	91172	his	252	" "
91003	91008	91114	91114	Gabriel	144	" said Matthew Moon . "
91061	91107	91114	91114	Gabriel	144	" ' Tis trew ' a used to bide about in a public - house wi ' a woman in a way he had no business to by rights , but there - ' a were a clever man in the sense of the term . "
91108	91112	91162	91162	Cainy	252	" Now then . "
91118	91126	91261	91261	Gabriel	144	" what did you see , Cain ? "
91127	91160	91261	91261	Gabriel	144	" I seed our mis'ess go into a sort of a park place , where there 's seats , and shrubs and flowers , arm - in - crook with a sojer . "
91183	91260	91172	91172	his	252	" And I think the sojer was Sergeant Troy . And they sat there together for more than half - an - hour , talking moving things , and she once was crying a'most to death . And when they came out her eyes were shining and she was as white as a lily ; and they looked into one another 's faces , as far - gone friendly as a man and woman can be . "
91269	91278	91172	91172	his	252	" Well , what did you see besides ? "
91279	91285	91172	91172	his	252	" Oh , all sorts . "
91286	91299	91172	91172	his	252	" White as a lily ? You are sure ' twas she ? "
91302	91303	91340	91340	You	1979	" "
91309	91310	91347	91347	ye	1979	" "
91338	91339	91366	91367	The boy	444	" "
91351	91355	91405	91406	the boy	444	" said Coggan . "
91360	91365	91421	91424	the people of Bath	1986	" interposed Joseph Poorgrass . "
91418	91419	91474	91475	other navigators	1988	" "
91426	91430	91471	91471	I	0	" continued Cain , "
91456	91457	91474	91475	other navigators	1988	" "
91465	91470	91483	91483	They	1988	" testified Matthew Moon . "
91481	91482	91503	91503	they	1988	" "
91489	91493	91524	91525	the natives	3554	" said Cain , "
91508	91509	91524	91525	the natives	3554	" "
91532	91536	91639	91639	you	1994	" said Matthew . "
91548	91556	91639	91639	you	1994	" asked Coggan , twirling his eye . "
91596	91597	91620	91625	a curious people that live therein	1992	" "
91611	91615	91652	91652	Ay	190	" observed Moon ; "
91627	91628	91720	91720	'em	1990	" "
91642	91651	91720	91720	'em	1990	" said Gabriel , returning to the group . "
91728	91729	91796	91796	I	0	" "
91734	91738	91827	91827	I	0	" murmured Gabriel . "
91814	91815	91840	91841	Mister Oak	146	" "
91825	91826	91878	91878	him	2002	" "
91843	91847	91878	91878	him	2002	" remonstrated Cainy . "
91873	91874	91995	91997	Our poor Parson	2010	" "
91885	91904	91995	91997	Our poor Parson	2010	" said Coggan . Gabriel settled into a despairing attitude of patience , and Cainy went on : - "
91993	91994	92092	92092	he	2012	" "
92009	92016	92106	92106	Gabriel	144	" said Matthew Moon , thoughtfully . "
92089	92090	92106	92106	Gabriel	144	" "
92101	92104	92144	92146	the illustrious traveller	2015	" em . "
92110	92126	92144	92146	the illustrious traveller	2015	" Well , that 's enough of this . Go on , Cainy - quick . "
92127	92142	92184	92185	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" Oh - and the new style of parsons wear moustaches and long beards . "
92148	92173	92184	92185	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" and look like Moses and Aaron complete , and make we fokes in the congregation feel all over like the children of Israel . "
92174	92182	92243	92244	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" A very right feeling - very . "
92187	92233	92243	92244	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" And there 's two religions going on in the nation now - High Church and High Chapel . And , thinks I , I 'll play fair ; so I went to High Church in the morning , and High Chapel in the afternoon . "
92234	92241	92309	92309	Oak	144	" A right and proper boy . "
92246	92295	92320	92321	Matthew Moon	181	" Well , at High Church they pray singing , and worship all the colours of the rainbow ; and at High Chapel they pray preaching , and worship drab and whitewash only . And then - i did n't see no more of Miss Everdene at all . "
92296	92307	92343	92343	She	2016	" Why did n't you say so afore , then ? "
92315	92318	92343	92343	She	2016	" Ah . "
92341	92342	92343	92343	She	2016	" "
92351	92357	92389	92389	You	2020	" said Gabriel , indignantly . "
92363	92367	92438	92439	Cain Ball	235	" said Coggan . "
92387	92388	92438	92439	Cain Ball	235	" "
92408	92414	92448	92448	you	235	" said Matthew , dubiously . "
92434	92435	92466	92467	Cain Ball	235	" "
92441	92446	92491	92491	you	235	" said Gabriel restlessly , "
92464	92465	92555	92557	the shep- herd	2029	" "
92478	92489	92566	92567	Mister Oak	146	" said Joseph in the sepulchral tone the circumstances demanded , "
92561	92562	92621	92621	Cain	235	" "
92569	92590	92621	92621	Cain	235	" said Cainy , looking from one to the other with great uneasiness at the spiritual magnitude of the position . "
92619	92620	92663	92664	Young man	2031	" "
92629	92634	92678	92678	you	235	" asked Joseph sternly . "
92668	92669	92742	92743	somebody else	2033	" "
92697	92705	92767	92768	Cain Ball	235	" said Cain , beginning to cry . "
92745	92746	92767	92768	Cain Ball	235	" "
92757	92766	92863	92863	she	167	" said Gabriel , turning to his work . "
92779	92842	92876	92876	I	0	" groaned Joseph Poorgrass . Then the reapers ' hooks were flourished again , and the old sounds went on . Gabriel , without making any pretence of being lively , did nothing to show that he was particularly dull . However , Coggan knew pretty nearly how the land lay , and when they were in a nook together he said - "
92869	92870	93117	93117	Gabriel	144	" "
92881	93112	93133	93133	sir	3717	" said Gabriel . CHAPTER XXXIV HOME AGAIN - A TRICKSTER THAT same evening at dusk Gabriel was leaning over Coggan 's garden - gate , taking an up - and - down survey before retiring to rest . A vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along the grassy margin of the lane . From it spread the tones of two women talking . The tones were natural and not at all suppressed . Oak instantly knew the voices to he those of Bathsheba and Liddy . The carriage came opposite and passed by . It was Miss Everdene 's gig , and Liddy and her mistress were the only occupants of the seat . Liddy was asking questions about the city of Bath , and her companion was answering them listlessly and unconcernedly . Both Bathsheba and the horse seemed weary . The exquisite relief of finding that she was here again , safe and sound , overpowered all reflection , and Oak could only luxuriate in the sense of it . All grave reports were forgotten . He lingered and lingered on , till there was no difference between the eastern and western expanses of sky , and the timid hares began to limp courageously round the dim hillocks . Gabriel might have been there an additional half - hour when a dark form walked slowly by . "
93119	93128	93420	93420	sir	3717	" the passer said . It was Boldwood . "
93135	93412	93420	93420	sir	3717	" said Gabriel . Boldwood likewise vanished up the road , and Oak shortly afterwards turned indoors to bed . Farmer Boldwood went on towards Miss Everdene 's house . He reached the front , and approaching the entrance , saw a light in the parlour . The blind was not drawn down , and inside the room was Bathsheba , looking over some papers or letters . Her back was towards Boldwood . He went to the door , knocked , and waited with tense muscles and an aching brow . Boldwood had not been outside his garden since his meeting with Bathsheba in the road to Yalbury . Silent and alone , he had remained in moody medita- tion on woman 's ways , deeming as essentials of the whole sex the accidents of the single one of their number he had ever closely beheld . By degrees a more charitable temper had pervaded him , and this was the reason of his sally to - night . He had come to apologize and beg forgiveness of Bathsheba with some- thing like a sense of shame at his violence , having but just now learnt that she had returned - only from a visit to Liddy , as he supposed , the Bath escapade being quite unknown to him . He inquired for Miss Everdene . Liddy 's manner was odd , but he did not notice it . She went in , leaving him standing there , and in her absence the blind of the room containing Bathsheba was pulled down . Bold- wood augured ill from that sign . Liddy came out . "
93422	93587	93420	93420	sir	3717	" she said . The farmer instantly went out by the gate . He as unforgiven - that was the issue of it all . He had seen her who was to him simultaneously a delight and a torture , sitting in the room he had shared with her as a peculiarly privileged guest only a little earlier in he summer , and she had denied him an entrance there now . Boldwood did not hurry homeward . It was ten o'clock at least , when , walking deliberately through the lower part of Weatherbury , he heard the carrier 's spring van entering the village . The van ran to and from a town in a northern direction , and it was owned and driven by a Weatherbury man , at the door of whose house it now pulled up . The lamp fixed to the head of the hood illuminated a scarlet and gilded form , who was the first to alight . "
93590	93596	93420	93420	sir	3717	" said Boldwood to himself , "
93603	93684	93758	93758	Troy	243	" Troy entered the carrier 's house , which had been the place of his lodging on his last visit to his native place . Boldwood was moved by a sudden determina- tion . He hastened home . In ten minutes he was back again , and made as if he were going to call upon Troy at the carrier 's . But as he approached , some one opened the door and came out . He heard this person say "
93688	93700	93758	93758	Troy	243	" to the inmates , and the voice was Troy 's . "
93772	93776	93758	93758	Troy	243	" Sergeant Troy ? "
93777	93784	93768	93768	Boldwood	224	" Yes - i'm Sergeant Troy . "
93785	93794	93803	93804	William Boldwood	332	" Just arrived from up the country , I think?"Just
93799	93800	93833	93833	I	0	" "
93806	93807	93833	93833	I	0	" "
93810	93832	93833	93833	I	0	" The tone in which this word was uttered was all that had been wanted to bring Boldwood to the point . "
93842	93846	93870	93870	I	0	" he said . "
93850	93851	93873	93873	your	224	" "
93868	93869	93873	93873	your	224	" "
93876	93883	93903	93903	you	224	" said Troy , moving on . "
93888	93898	93964	93964	I	0	" said Boldwood , standing in front of him , "
93914	93960	93987	93989	somebody or other	2043	" Troy heard the dull determination in Boldwood 's voice , looked at his stalwart frame , then at the thick cudgel he carried in his hand . He remembered it was past ten o'clock . It seemed worth while to be civil to Boldwood . "
93970	93981	94044	94044	You	224	" said Troy , placing his bag on the ground , "
93998	93999	94064	94064	I	0	" "
94050	94051	94064	94064	I	0	" "
94068	94069	94137	94137	I	0	" "
94072	94088	94186	94186	I	0	" Troy was about to utter something hastily ; he then checked himself and said , "
94094	94136	94186	94186	I	0	" His voice was changed . Previously it had had a devil - may - care tone . It was the voice of a trickster now . Boldwood 's present mood was not critical enough to notice tones . He continued , "
94184	94185	94186	94186	I	0	" "
94189	94193	94261	94261	I	0	" said Troy . "
94200	94260	94277	94277	you	224	" An old tree trunk lay under the hedge immediately opposite , and they sat down . The tone in which this word was uttered was all Troy heard the dull determination in Boldwood 's voice , looked at his stalwart frame , then at the thick plainly ; and understand , I do n't wish to enter into the "
94271	94275	94277	94277	you	224	" said Boldwood , "
94282	94283	94277	94277	you	224	" "
94287	94291	94305	94305	she	167	" said Troy . "
94297	94298	94277	94277	you	224	" "
94314	94315	94277	94277	you	224	" "
94317	94321	94305	94305	she	167	might!"Would , then . "
94322	94409	94277	94277	you	224	" If you had not come I should certainly - yes , certainly - have been accepted by this time . If you had not seen her you might have been married to Fanny . Well , there 's too much difference between Miss Ever- dene 's station and your own for this flirtation with her ever to benefit you by ending in marriage . So all I ask is , do n't molest her any more . Marry Fanny . make it worth your while . "
94410	94415	94730	94730	Troy	243	" How will you ? "
94416	94562	94730	94730	Troy	243	" I 'll pay you well now , I 'll settle a sum of money upon her , and I 'll see that you do n't suffer from poverty in the future . I 'll put it clearly . Bathsheba is only playing with you : you are too poor for her as I said ; so give up wasting your time about a great match you 'll never make for a moderate and rightful match you may make to - morrow ; take up your carpet - bag , turn about , leave Weatherbury now , this night , and you shall take fifty pounds with you . Fanny shall have fifty to enable her to prepare for the wedding , when you have told me where she is living , and she shall have five hundred paid down on her wedding - day . "
94722	94728	94719	94719	he	224	" I like Fanny best . "
94732	94770	94730	94730	Troy	243	" and if , as you say , Miss Everdene is out of my reach , why I have all to gain by accepting your money , and marrying Fan . But she 's only a servant . "
94771	94782	94793	94793	Boldwood	224	" Never mind - do you agree to my arrangement ? "
94783	94787	94793	94793	Boldwood	224	" I do . "
94788	94791	94834	94834	Troy	243	" Ah ! "
94801	94824	94834	94834	Troy	243	" O , Troy , if you like her best , why then did you step in here and injure my happiness ? "
94825	94832	94793	94793	Boldwood	224	" I love Fanny best now . "
94836	94858	94834	94834	Troy	243	" But Bathsh - - Miss Everdene inflamed me , and displaced Fanny for a time . It is over now . "
94859	94877	94899	94899	Boldwood	224	" Why should it be over so soon ? And why then did you come here again ? "
94878	94892	94911	94911	He	224	" There are weighty reasons . Fifty pounds at once , you said ! "
94893	94897	94936	94937	the sergeant	1330	" I did . "
94901	94910	94953	94953	Boldwood	224	" and here they are - fifty sovereigns . "
94918	94934	94953	94953	Boldwood	224	" You have everything ready - it seems that you calculated on my accepting them . "
94943	94951	95049	95049	Troy	243	" I thought you might accept them . "
94955	94978	95049	95049	Troy	243	" You 've only my word that the programme shall be adhered to , whilst I at any rate have fifty pounds . "
94979	95041	95077	95077	he	243	" l had thought of that , and l have considered that if I ca n't appeal to your honour I can trust to your - well , shrewdness we 'll call it - not to lose five hundred pounds in prospect , and also make a bitter enemy of a man who is willing to be an extremely useful friend . "
95042	95047	95077	95077	he	243	" Stop , listen ! "
95068	95076	95049	95049	Troy	243	" By George - ' tis she . "
95080	95089	95049	95049	Troy	243	" I must go on and meet her . "
95090	95095	95114	95114	Boldwood	224	" She - who ? "
95096	95099	95114	95114	Boldwood	224	" Bathsheba . "
95100	95112	95049	95049	Troy	243	" Bathsheba - out alone at this time o ' night ! "
95122	95129	95049	95049	Troy	243	" Why must you meet her ? "
95130	95159	95114	95114	Boldwood	224	" She was expecting me to - night - and I must now speak to her , and wish her good - bye , according to your wish . "
95160	95170	95049	95049	Troy	243	" I do n't see the necessity of speaking . "
95171	95215	95049	95049	Troy	243	" It can do no harm - and she 'll be wandering about looking for me if I do n't . You shall hear all I say to her . It will help you in your love - making when I am gone . "
95216	95222	95114	95114	Boldwood	224	" Your tone is mocking . "
95223	95262	95049	95049	Troy	243	" O no . And remember this , if she does not know what has become of me , she will think more about me than if I tell her flatly I have come to give her up . "
95263	95283	95305	95305	you	2058	" Will you confine your words to that one point ? - Shall I hear every word you say ? "
95284	95296	95354	95354	You	2058	" Every word . Now sit still there , and hold my "
95308	95339	95363	95363	I	0	" The light footstep came closer , halting occasionally , as if the walker listened for a sound . Troy whistled a double note in a soft , fluty tone . "
95347	95353	95363	95363	I	0	" murmured Boldwood , uneasily . "
95358	95362	95373	95373	Frank	244	" said Troy . "
95367	95372	95373	95373	Frank	244	" Troy stepped forward . "
95381	95388	95373	95373	Frank	244	" The tones were Bathsheba 's . "
95392	95396	95408	95408	you	2058	" said Boldwood . "
95399	95405	95454	95454	I	0	" said Troy to her . "
95411	95417	95454	95454	I	0	" she continued , tenderly . "
95452	95453	95471	95471	you	0	" "
95460	95464	95471	95471	you	0	" said Frank . "
95474	95475	95550	95550	I	0	" "
95483	95489	95550	95550	I	0	" she said , playfully ; "
95569	95570	95612	95612	I	0	" "
95573	95577	95612	95612	I	0	" said Troy . "
95624	95625	95685	95685	I	0	" "
95628	95683	95717	95717	I	0	" She turned and tripped up the hill again . During the progress of this dialogue there was a nervous twitching of Boldwood 's tightly closed lips , and his face became bathed in a clammy dew . He now started forward towards Troy . Troy turned to him and took up the bag . "
95701	95708	95746	95746	you	0	" said the soldier , mockingly . "
95729	95738	95807	95807	you	0	" said Boldwood , in a hoarse whisper . "
95741	95745	95807	95807	you	0	" said Troy , "
95814	95845	95854	95854	You	0	" At the same instant Boldwood sprang upon him , and held him by the neck . Troy felt Boldwood 's grasp slowly tightening . The move was absolutely unexpected . "
95849	95853	95881	95881	Troy	244	" he gasped . "
95861	95862	95883	95883	Boldwood	224	" "
95870	95879	95867	95867	you	0	" said the farmer . Give me breath . "
95890	95902	95883	95883	Boldwood	224	" By Heaven , I 've a mind to kill you ! "
95903	95908	95930	95930	Boldwood	224	" And ruin her . "
95909	95913	95956	95956	he	224	" Save her . "
95914	95929	95978	95978	himself	244	" Oh , how can she be saved now , unless I marry her ? "
95947	95954	96057	96057	Boldwood	224	" Devil , you torture me ! "
95983	96044	95978	95978	himself	244	" It is not worth while to measure my strength with you . Indeed it is a barbarous way of settling a quarrel . I shall shortly leave the army because of the same conviction . Now after that revelation of how the land lies with Bathsheba , ' twould be a mistake to kill me , would it not ? "
96045	96055	95978	95978	himself	244	" ' Twould be a mistake to kill you . "
96066	96071	95978	95978	himself	244	" Better kill yourself . "
96072	96076	95978	95978	himself	244	" Far better . "
96077	96085	96167	96168	Bold- wood	249	" I 'm glad you see it . "
96086	96149	96167	96168	Bold- wood	249	" Troy , make her your wife , and do n't act upon what I arranged just now . The alternative is dreadful , but take Bathsheba ; I give her up ! She must love you indeed to sell soul and body to you so utterly as she has done . Wretched woman - deluded woman - you are , Bathsheba ! "
96150	96155	96203	96203	she	2075	" But about Fanny ? "
96156	96165	96235	96235	Troy	243	" Bathsheba is a woman well to do . "
96200	96201	96244	96244	I	0	" "
96233	96234	96263	96263	Troy	243	" "
96237	96243	96269	96270	poor Fanny	217	" said Boldwood , imploringly , "
96265	96266	96310	96310	I	0	" "
96272	96273	96352	96352	I	0	" "
96308	96309	96352	96352	I	0	" "
96322	96351	96392	96392	me	0	" Boldwood 's arm moved spasmodically towards Troy 's person again . He repressed the instinct , and his form drooped as with pain . Troy went on - "
96363	96364	96392	96392	me	0	" "
96399	96400	96436	96436	I	0	" "
96403	96404	96436	96436	I	0	" "
96449	96465	96504	96504	yours	2079	" Troy paused in secret amazement at Boldwood 's wild infatuation . He carelessly said , "
96474	96475	96537	96537	I	0	" "
96506	96536	96563	96563	I	0	" Boldwood , more like a somnambulist than a wakeful man , pulled out the large canvas bag he carried by way of a purse , and searched it . "
96547	96551	96602	96602	she	2081	" he said . "
96571	96572	96602	96602	she	2081	" "
96611	96612	96637	96637	we	2080	" "
96617	96623	96655	96655	we	2080	" said Boldwood , hastily . "
96652	96653	96688	96688	she	2081	" "
96661	96662	96688	96688	she	2081	" "
96685	96686	96688	96688	she	2081	" "
96698	96699	96688	96688	she	2081	" "
96706	96727	96786	96786	you	2085	" They went up the hill to Bathsheba 's house . When they stood at the entrance , Troy said , "
96733	96782	96820	96820	I	0	" Opening the door , he glided inside , leaving the door ajar . Boldwood waited . In two minutes a light appeared in the passage . Boldwood then saw that the chain had been fastened across the door . Troy appeared inside , carrying a bedroom candlestick . "
96793	96799	96820	96820	I	0	" said Boldwood , contemptuously . "
96826	96846	96820	96820	I	0	" Troy handed a folded newspaper through the slit between door and doorpost , and put the candle close . "
96852	96868	96952	96952	Troy	243	" he said , placing his finger on a line . Boldwood looked and read - "
96871	96936	96972	96972	Troy	243	" On the 17th inst . , at St. Ambrose 's Church , Bath , by the Rev. G. Mincing , B.A. , Francis Troy , only son of the late Edward Troy , Esq . , H.D. , of Weatherbury , and sergeant with Dragoon Guards , to Bathsheba , only surviving daughter of the late Mr , John Everdene , of Casterbridge . "
96937	96950	97133	97133	Boldwood	224	" This may be called Fort meeting Feeble , hey , Boldwood ? "
96975	97121	97149	97149	Troy	243	" Fifty pounds to marry Fanny , Good . Twenty - one pounds not to marry Fanny , but Bathsheba . Good . Finale : already Bathsheba 's husband . Now , Boldwood , yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends inter- ference between a man and his wife . And another word . Bad as I am , I am not such a villain as to make the marriage or misery of any woman a matter of huckster and sale . Fanny has long ago left me . do n't know where she is . I have searched everywhere . Another word yet . You say you love Bathsheba ; yet on the merest apparent evidence you instantly believe in her dishonour . A fig for such love ! Now that I 've taught you a lesson , take your money back again . "
97122	97131	97173	97173	his	224	" I will not ; I will not ! "
97139	97147	97526	97526	he	180	" Anyhow I wo n't have it . "
97179	97205	97537	97537	he	144	" You juggler of Satan ! You black hound ! But I 'll punish you yet ; mark me , I 'll punish you yet ! "
97519	97525	97563	97563	Coggan	180	" She has married him ! "
97549	97560	97563	97563	Coggan	180	" I fancied we should know something to - day . "
97565	97581	97614	97614	Oak	144	" I heard wheels pass my door just after dark - you were out somewhere . "He
97587	97607	97614	97614	Oak	144	" Good heavens above us , Oak , how white your face is ; you look like a corpse ! "
97608	97612	97642	97642	They	2100	" Do I ? "
97621	97633	97879	97879	he	1330	" Lean on the gate : I 'll wait a bit . "
97634	97641	97908	97908	he	180	" All right , all right . "
97873	97878	97908	97908	he	180	" Morning , comrades ! "
97898	97907	97978	97978	he	1330	" Bain't ye going to answer the man ? "
97914	97939	97996	97996	Troy	243	" I 'd say good morning - you need n't spend a hapenny of meaning upon it , and yet keep the man civil . "
97970	97977	98011	98011	Coggan	180	" Good morning , Sergeant Troy . "

98060	98113	98188	98188	he	2107	" Yes - I suppose so ; but I feel like new wine in an old bottle here . My notion is that sash - windows should be put throughout , and these old wainscoted walls brightened up a bit ; or the oak cleared quite away , and the walls papered . "

98225	98256	98274	98274	you	2111	" The military man turned and surveyed the interior of the room , to assist his ideas of improvement in this direction . Gabriel and Coggan began to move on . "

98287	98294	98310	98310	I	0	" Jan reflected for a moment . "
98318	98322	98480	98480	you	2111	" he said . "
98329	98335	98480	98480	you	2111	" said Troy , lightly . "
98425	98476	98500	98500	I	0	" Troy threw the coin dexterously across the front plot and over the fence towards Gabriel , who shunned it in its fall , his face turning to an angry red . Coggan twirled his eye , edged forward , and caught the money in its ricochet upon the road . "
98486	98495	98500	98500	I	0	" said Gabriel with disdain and almost fiercely . "
98509	98510	98560	98560	you	2111	" "
98518	98524	98638	98639	Mr. Boldwood	224	" said Coggan , musingly . "
98567	98568	98638	98639	Mr. Boldwood	224	" "
98614	98635	98649	98649	Troy	243	" A horseman , whom they had for some time seen in the distance , now appeared close beside them . "
98641	98645	99394	99394	I	0	" said Oak . "
98655	99383	99394	99394	I	0	" Coggan and Oak nodded respectfully to the farmer , just checked their paces to discover if they were wanted , and finding they were not stood back to let him pass on . The only signs of the terrible sorrow Boldwood had been combating through the night , and was combating now , were the want of colour in his well - defined face , the enlarged appearance of the veins in his forehead and temples , and the sharper lines about his mouth . The horse bore him away , and the very step of the animal seemed significant of dogged despair . Gabriel , for a minute , rose above his own grief in noticing Boldwood 's . He saw the square figure sitting erect upon the horse , the head turned to neither side , the elbows steady by the hips , the brim of the hat level and undisturbed in its onward glide , until the keen edges of Boldwood 's shape sank by degrees over the hill . To one who knew the man and his story there was something more striking in this immobility than in a collapse . The clash of discord between mood and matter here was forced painfully home to the heart ; and , as in laughter there are more dreadful phases than in tears , so was there in the steadiness of this agonized man an expression deeper than a cry . CHAPTER XXXVI WEALTH IN JEOPARDY - THE REVEL ONE night , at the end of August , when Bathsheba 's experiences as a married woman were still new , and when the weather was yet dry and sultry , a man stood motionless in the stockyard of Weatherbury Upper Farm , looking at the moon and sky . The night had a sinister aspect . A heated breeze from the south slowly fanned the summits of lofty objects , and in the sky dashes of buoyant cloud were sailing in a course at right angles to that of another stratum , neither of them in the direction of the breeze below . The moon , as seen through these films , had a lurid metallic look . The fields were sallow with the impure light , and all were tinged in monochrome , as if beheld through stained glass . The same evening the sheep had trailed homeward head to tail , the behaviour of the rooks had been confused , and the horses had moved with timidity and caution . Thunder was imminent , and , taking some secondary appearances into consideration , it was likely to be followed by one of the lengthened rains which mark the close of dry weather for the season . Before twelve hours had passed a harvest atmosphere would be a bygone thing . Oak gazed with misgiving at eight naked and un- protected ricks , massive and heavy with the rich produce of one - half the farm for that year . He went on to the barn . This was the night which had been selected by Sergeant Troy - ruling now in the room of his wife - for giving the harvest supper and dance . As Oak approached the building the sound of violins and a tambourine , and the regular jigging of many feet , grew more distinct . He came close to the large doors , one of which stood slightly ajar , and looked in . The central space , together with the recess at one end , was emptied of all incumbrances , and this area , covering about two - thirds of the whole , was appropriated for the gathering , the remaining end , which was piled to the ceiling with oats , being screened off with sail- cloth . Tufts and garlands of green foliage decorated the walls , beams , and extemporized chandeliers , and immediately opposite to Oak a rostrum had been erected , bearing a table and chairs . Here sat three fiddlers , and beside them stood a frantic man with his hair on end , perspiration streaming down his cheeks , and a tambourine quivering in his hand . The dance ended , and on the black oak floor in the midst a new row of couples formed for another . "
99403	99409	99394	99394	I	0	" said the first violin . "
99417	99455	99526	99527	the sergeant	1330	" said the clear voice of Bathsheba , who stood at the inner end of the build- ing , observing the scene from behind a table covered with cups and viands . Troy was lolling beside her . "
99458	99463	99526	99527	the sergeant	1330	" said the fiddler , "
99476	99481	99526	99527	the sergeant	1330	" The Soldier 's Joy "

99518	99524	99526	99527	the sergeant	1330	" Thanks for the compliment . "
99545	99593	99706	99717	a performer who understands the proper convulsions , spasms , St. vitus	2131	" For though I have pur- chased my discharge from Her Most Gracious Majesty 's regiment of cavalry the 11th Dragoon Guards , to attend to the new duties awaiting me here , I shall continue a soldier in spirit and feeling as long as I live . "
99604	99610	99815	99815	he	144	" The Soldier 's Joy . "
99675	99680	99840	99840	you	1330	" The Soldier 's Joy "
99829	99838	99881	99882	M. Troy	340	" The sergeant said he could not attend . "
99846	99850	99896	99896	he	340	" said Gabriel , "
99879	99880	99896	99896	he	340	" "
99889	99894	100078	100078	he	2140	" returned the messenger , "
99908	99973	100147	100147	ye	144	" In Juxtaposition with Troy , Oak had a melancholy tendency to look like a candle beside gas , and ill at ease , he went out again , thinking he would go home ; for , under the circumstances , he had no heart for the scene in the barn . At the door he paused for a moment : Troy was speaking . "
100085	100104	100147	100147	ye	144	" Bathsheba put her hand upon his arm , and , with upturned pale face , said imploringly , "
100134	100135	100178	100178	Friends	2135	" "
100149	100155	100185	100185	we	2137	" said one or two . "
100158	100177	100257	100257	company	2148	" said the sergeant contemptuously , and raised his voice as if lighted up by a new idea . "
100180	100184	100257	100257	company	2148	" he said , "
100233	100256	101060	101060	I	0	" Bathsheba indignantly left the barn , followed by all the women and children . The musicians , not looking upon themselves as "
100259	101000	101225	101233	the wretched persons of all the work - folk	2150	" slipped quietly away to their spring waggon and put in the horse . Thus Troy and the men on the farm were left sole occupants of the place . Oak , not to appear unneces- sarily disagreeable , stayed a little while ; then he , too , arose and quietly took his departure , followed by a friendly oath from the sergeant for not staying to a second round of grog . Gabriel proceeded towards his home . In approach- ing the door , his toe kicked something which felt and sounded soft , leathery , and distended , like a boxing- glove . It was a large toad humbly travelling across the path . Oak took it up , thinking it might be better to kill the creature to save it from pain ; but finding it uninjured , he placed it again among the grass . He knew what this direct message from the Great Mother meant . And soon came another . When he struck a light indoors there appeared upon the table a thin glistening streak , as if a brush of varnish had been lightly dragged across it . Oak 's eyes followed the serpentine sheen to the other side , where it led up to a huge brown garden - slug , which had come indoors to - night for reasons of its own . It was Nature 's second way of hinting to him that he was to prepare for foul weather . Oak sat down meditating for nearly an hour . During this time two black spiders , of the kind common in thatched houses , promenaded the ceiling , ultimately dropping to the floor . This reminded him that if there was one class of manifestation on this matter that he thoroughly understood , it was the instincts of sheep . He left the room , ran across two or three fields towards the flock , got upon a hedge , and looked over among them . They were crowded close together on the other side around some furze bushes , and the first peculiarity ob- servable was that , on the sudden appearance of Oak 's head over the fence , they did not stir or run away . They had now a terror of something greater than their terror of man . But this was not the most noteworthy feature : they were all grouped in such a way that their tails , without a single exception , were towards that half of the horizon from which the storm threatened . There was an inner circle closely huddled , and outside these they radiated wider apart , the pattern formed by the flock as a whole not being unlike a vandyked lace collar , to which the clump of furze - bushes stood in the position of a wearer 's neck . opinion . He knew now that he was right , and that Troy was wrong . Every voice in nature was unanimous in bespeaking change . But two distinct translations attached to these dumb expressions . Apparently there was to be a thunder - storm , and afterwards a cold con- tinuous rain . The creeping things seemed to know all about the later rain , hut little of the interpolated thunder - storm ; whilst the sheep knew all about the thunder - storm and nothing of the later rain . This complication of weathers being uncommon , was all the more to be feared . Oak returned to the stack - yard . All was silent here , and the conical tips of the ricks jutted darkly into the sky . There were five wheat - ricks in this yard , and three stacks of barley . The wheat when threshed would average about thirty quarters to each stack ; the barley , at least forty . Their value to Bathsheba , and indeed to anybody , Oak mentally estimated by the following simple calcula- tion : - 5 x 30 150 quarters 500 L. 3 x 40 120 quarters 250 L. Total . . 750 L. Seven hundred and fifty pounds in the divinest form that money can wear - that of necessary food for man and beast : should the risk be run of deteriorating this bulk of corn to less than half its value , because of the instability of a woman?"Never
101008	101059	101483	101483	Coggan	180	" said Gabriel . Such was the argument that Oak set outwardly before him . But man , even to himself , is a palimpsest , having an ostensible writing , and another beneath the lines . It is possible that there was this golden legend under the utilitarian one : "
101075	101223	101529	101529	Gabriel	144	" He went back to the barn to endeavour to obtain assistance for covering the ricks that very night . All was silent within , and he would have passed on in the belief that the party had broken up , had not a dim light , yellow as saffron by contrast with the greenish whiteness outside , streamed through a knot - hole in the folding doors . Gabriel looked in . An unusual picture met his eye . The candles suspended among the evergreens had burnt down to their sockets , and in some cases the leaves tied about them were scorched . Many of the lights had quite gone out , others smoked and stank , grease dropping from them upon the floor . Here , under the table , and leaning against forms and chairs in every conceivable attitude except the perpendicular , ! "

101994	102016	102044	102044	Gabriel	144	" Mrs. Tall , I 've come for the key of the granary , to get at the rick - cloths . "
102025	102030	102044	102044	Gabriel	144	" Is that you ? "
102039	102042	102032	102034	Mrs. Susan Tall	211	" Yes . "

102104	102115	102044	102044	Gabriel	144	" I did n't . I thought you meant - - "
102116	102127	102160	102160	Gabriel	144	" Yes you did ! what do you want here ? "
102128	102135	103056	103056	Gabriel	144	" The key of the granary . "
102136	102159	103071	103071	Bathsheba	243	" Take it then . ' Tis on the nail . People coming disturbing women at this time of night ought - - "
103047	103054	103071	103071	Bathsheba	243	" Is that you , ma'am ? "
103061	103066	103140	103140	He	2191	" Who is there ? "
103073	103084	103140	103140	He	2191	" Gabriel . I am on the rick , thatching . "
103085	103139	103148	103148	you	144	" O , Gabriel ! - and are you ? I have come about them . The weather awoke me , and I thought of the corn . I am so distressed about it - can we save it any- how ? I can not find my husband . Is he with you ? "
103145	103146	103163	103163	He	2191	" "
103154	103155	103204	103204	I	0	" "
103161	103162	103229	103229	you	144	" "
103209	103210	103279	103279	I	0	" "
103242	103246	103279	103279	I	0	" said Gabriel . "
103277	103278	103279	103279	I	0	" "
103284	103428	103279	103279	I	0	" she said , resolutely . She instantly took a sheaf upon her shoulder , clambered up close to his heels , placed it behind the rod , and descended for another . At her third ascent the rick suddenly brightened with the brazen glare of shining majolica - every knot in every straw was visible . On the slope in front of him appeared two human shapes , black as jet . The rick lost its sheen - the shapes vanished . Gabriel turned his head . It had been the sixth flash which had come from the east behind him , and the two dark forms on the slope had been the shadows of himself and Bathsheba . Then came the peal . It hardly was credible that such a heavenly light could be the parent of such a diabolical sound . "
103432	103608	103279	103279	I	0	" she exclaimed , and clutched him by the sleeve . Gabriel turned , and steadied her on her aerial perch by holding her arm . At the same moment , while he was still reversed in his attitude , there was more light , and he saw , as it were , a copy of the tall poplar tree on the hill drawn in black on the wall of the barn . It was the shadow of that tree , thrown across by a secondary flash in the west . The next flare came . Bathsheba was on the ground now , shouldering another sheaf , and she bore its dazzle without flinching - thunder and ali - and again ascended with the load . There was then a silence everywhere for four or five minutes , and the crunch of the spars , as Gabriel hastily drove them in , could again be distinctly heard . He thought the crisis of the storm had passed . But there came a burst of light . "
103612	104050	103279	103279	I	0	" said Gabriel , taking the sheaf from her shoulder , and grasping her arm again . Heaven opened then , indeed . The flash was almost too novel for its inexpressibly dangerous nature to be at once realized , and they could only comprehend the magnificence of its beauty . It sprang from east , west , north , south , and was a perfect dance of death . The forms of skeletons appeared in the air , shaped with blue fire for bones - dancing , leaping , striding , racing around , and mingling altogether in unparalleled con- fusion . With these were intertwined undulating snakes of green , and behind these was a broad mass of lesser light . Simultaneously came from every part of the tumbling sky what may be called a shout ; since , though no shout ever came near it , it was more of the nature of a shout than of anything else earthly . In the meantime one of the grisly forms had alighted upon the point of Gabriel 's rod , to run invisibly down it , down the chain , and into the earth . Gabriel was almost blinded , and he could feel Bathsheba 's warm arm tremble in his hand - a sensation novel and thrilling enough ; but love , life , everything human , seemed small and trifling in such close juxtaposition with an infuriated universe . Oak had hardly time to gather up these impressions into a thought , and to see how strangely the red feather of her hat shone in this light , when the tall tree on the hill before mentioned seemed on fire to a white heat , and a new one among these terrible voices mingled with the last crash of those preceding . It was a stupefying blast , harsh and pitiless , and it fell upon their ears in a dead , flat blow , without that reverberation which lends the tones of a drum to more distant thunder . By the lustre reflected from every part of the earth and from the wide domical scoop above it , he saw that the tree was sliced down the whole length of its tall , straight stem , a huge riband of bark being apparently flung off . The other portion remained erect , and revealed the bared surface as a strip of white down the front . The lightning had struck the tree . A sulphurous smell filled the air ; then all was silent , and black as a cave in Hinnom . "
104057	104063	104174	104174	I	0	" said Gabriel , hurriedly . "
104070	104159	104174	104174	I	0	" Bathsheba said nothing ; but he could distinctly hear her rhythmical pants , and the recurrent rustle of the sheaf beside her in response to her frightened pulsations . She descended the ladder , and , on second thoughts , he followed her . The darkness was now impenetrable by the sharpest vision . They both stood still at the bottom , side by side . Bathsheba appeared to think only of the weather - Oak thought only of her just then . At last he said - "
104172	104173	104242	104242	Heaven	269	" "
104179	104183	104242	104242	Heaven	269	" said Bathsheba . "
104193	104224	104254	104254	I	0	" The sky was now filled with an incessant light , frequent repetition melting into complete continuity , as an unbroken sound results from the successive strokes on a gong . "
104228	104232	104285	104288	some of the others	1958	" said he . "
104261	104262	104293	104293	They	1958	" "
104291	104292	104314	104314	I	0	" "
104302	104311	104372	104372	I	0	" said Oak , in a hesitating way . "
104321	104328	104382	104382	I	0	" she said , adding slowly : "
104370	104371	104382	104382	I	0	" "
104377	104381	104546	104546	Gabriel	144	" said Gabriel . "
104388	104488	104629	104629	mistress	996	" He crossed to the barn , leaving her there alone . He looked through the chinks of the door . All was in total darkness , as he had left it , and there still arose , as at the former time , the steady buzz of many snores . He felt a zephyr curling about his cheek , and turned . It was Bathsheba 's breath - she had followed him , and was looking into the same chink . He endeavoured to put off the immediate and pain- ful subject of their thoughts by remarking gently , "
104513	104545	104629	104629	mistress	996	" Then Oak went back again , ascended to the top , stepped off the ladder for greater expedition , and went on thatching . She followed , but without a sheaf "
104548	104626	104659	104659	I	0	" she said , in a strange and impressive voice . Oak looked up at her . She had not spoken since he left the barn . The soft and continual shimmer of the dying lightning showed a marble face high against the black sky of the opposite quarter . Bathsheba was sitting almost on the apex of the stack , her feet gathered up beneath her , and resting on the top round of the ladder . "
104631	104635	104659	104659	I	0	" he said . "
104657	104658	104687	104687	others	618	" "
104668	104685	104687	104687	others	618	" he answered , somewhat surprised at the abruptness with which this new subject was broached . "
104693	104694	104700	104700	you	0	" "
104697	104698	104715	104715	I	0	" "

104786	104792	104844	104844	I	0	" Gabriel ceased his rustling . "
104842	104843	104994	104994	I	0	" "
104849	104850	105044	105044	He	304	" "
105001	105018	105044	105044	He	304	" She cleared her voice , and waited a moment , as if to gather breath . "
105031	105043	105160	105160	I	0	" she whispered with desperate impetuosity . Gabriel made no reply . "
105063	105068	105160	105160	I	0	" she quickly added . "
105121	105159	105200	105200	I	0	" She went down the ladder , and the work proceeded . Gabriel soon perceived a languor in the movements of his mistress up and down , and he said to her , gently as a mother - "
105194	105195	105226	105226	You	304	" "
105204	105213	105240	105240	You	304	" said Bathsheba , in a flagging cadence . "
105224	105225	105285	105285	She	0	" "
105245	105246	105564	105564	he	144	" "
105251	105284	105564	105564	he	144	" she said , gratefully . ! Thank you for your devotion , a thousand times , Gabriel ! Good- night - i know you are doing your very best for me . "
105580	105745	105564	105564	he	144	" The rain came on in earnest , and Oak soon felt the water to be tracking cold and clammy routes down his back . Ultimately he was reduced well - nigh to a homogeneous sop , and the dyes of his clothes trickled down and stood in a pool at the foot of the ladder . The rain stretched obliquely through the dull atmo- sphere in liquid spines , unbroken in continuity between their beginnings in the clouds and their points in him . Oak suddenly remembered that eight months before this time he had been fighting against fire in the same spot as desperately as he was fighting against water now - and for a futile love of the same woman . As for her - - But Oak was generous and true , and dis- missed his reflections . It was about seven o'clock in the dark leaden morning when Gabriel came down from the last stack , and thankfully exclaimed , "
105750	105960	106001	106001	I	0	" He was drenched , weary , and sad , and yet not so sad as drenched and weary , for he was cheered by a sense of success in a good cause . Faint sounds came from the barn , and he looked that way . Figures stepped singly and in pairs through the doors - all walking awkwardly , and abashed , save the foremost , who wore a red jacket , and advanced with his hands in his pockets , whistling . The others shambled after with a conscience - stricken air : the whole procession was not unlike Flaxman 's group of the suitors tottering on towards the infernal regions under the conduct of Mercury . The gnarled shapes passed into the village , Troy , their leader , entering the farmhouse . Not a single one of them had turned his face to the ricks , or apparently bestowed one thought upon their condition . Soon Oak too went homeward , by a different route from theirs . In front of him against the wet glazed surface of the lane he saw a person walking yet more slowly than himself under an umbrella . The man turned and plainly started ; he was Boldwood . "
105969	105973	106001	106001	I	0	" said Oak . "
105999	106000	106028	106028	Oak	144	" "
106010	106021	106054	106054	I	0	" Boldwood seemed to awake to the present by degrees . "
106030	106040	106076	106076	I	0	" he said then , desultorily regarding his companion . "
106052	106053	106086	106086	you	0	" "
106074	106075	106099	106099	you	0	" "
106094	106095	106123	106123	I	0	" "
106103	106109	106149	106149	Yours	0	" said Boldwood , shortly . "
106121	106122	106149	106149	Yours	0	" "
106157	106158	106175	106175	you	0	" "
106162	106172	106175	106175	you	0	" Boldwood added , after an interval of silence : "
106180	106181	106175	106175	you	0	" "
106191	106192	106175	106175	you	0	" "
106195	106196	106175	106175	you	0	" "

106215	106216	106230	106231	the thatcher	2223	" "
106222	106223	106175	106175	you	0	" "
106237	106238	106175	106175	you	0	" "
106245	106260	106175	106175	you	0	stile?"Nor the little one by the stile . I overlooked the ricks this year . "
106261	106276	106175	106175	you	0	" Then not a tenth of your corn will come to measure , sir . "
106277	106281	106495	106495	I	0	" Possibly not . "
106285	106446	106495	106495	I	0	" repeated Gabriel slowly to him- self . It is difficult to describe the intensely dramatic effect that announcement had upon Oak at such a moment . All the night he had been feeling that the neglect he was labouring to repair was abnormal and isolated - the only instance of the kind within the circuit of the county . Yet at this very time , within the same parish , a greater waste had been going on , uncomplained of and disregarded . A few months earlier Boldwood 's forgetting his husbandry would have been as preposter- ous an idea as a sailor forgetting he was in a ship . Oak was just thinking that whatever he himself might have suffered from Bathsheba 's marriage , here was a man who had suffered more , when Boldwood spoke in a changed voice - that of one who yearned to make a confidence and relieve his heart by an outpouring . "
106493	106494	106576	106576	I	0	" "
106504	106541	106578	106578	I	0	" said Gabriel , not knowing enough of the full depths of Boldwood 's love to keep silence on the farmer 's account , and determined not to evade discipline by doing so on his own . "
106556	106575	106674	106674	Boldwood	224	" he added , with the repose of a man whom misfortune had inured rather than sub- dued . "
106586	106612	106692	106692	he	224	" said Bold- wood , as if the subject came irresistibly to his tongue , and with a miserable lightness meant to express his indifference . "
106622	106673	106692	106692	he	224	" - But the real truth of the matter is that there was not , as some fancy , any jilting on - her part . No engagement ever existed between me and Miss Ever- dene . People say so , but it is untrue : she never promised me ! "
106686	106691	106821	106821	he	224	" O , Gabriel . "
106695	106785	106821	106821	he	224	" I am weak and foolish , and I do n't know what , and I ca n't fend off my miserable grief ! ... I had some faint belief in the mercy of God till I lost that woman . Yes , He prepared a gourd to shade me , and like the prophet I thanked Him and was glad . But the next day He prepared a worm to smite the gourd and wither it ; and I feel it is better to die than to live ! "
106815	106820	107090	107090	him	2237	" No , Gabriel . "
106839	106899	107159	107159	he	2237	" it was made more of by other people than ever it was by us . I do feel a little regret occasionally , but no woman ever had power over me for any length of time . Well , good morning ; I can trust you not to mention to others what has passed between us two here . "
107091	107093	107159	107159	he	2237	" Sergeant "
107132	107158	107159	107159	he	2237	" Yes , if it had n't been for that wretched rain I should have cleared two hundred as easy as looking , my love . "
107163	107210	107159	107159	he	2237	" Do n't you see , it altered all the chances ? To speak like a book I once read , wet weather is the narrative , and fine days are the episodes , of our country 's history ; now , is n't that true ? "
107211	107223	107445	107445	Bathsheba	243	" But the time of year is come for changeable weather . "
107224	107435	107445	107445	Bathsheba	243	" Well , yes . The fact is , these autumn races are the ruin of everybody . Never did I see such a day as ' twas ! ' Tis a wild open place , just out of Budmouth , and a drab sea rolled in towards us like liquid misery . Wind and rain - good Lord ! Dark ? Why , ' twas as black as my hat before the last race was run . ' Twas five o'clock , and you could n't see the horses till they were almost in , leave alone colours . The ground was as heavy as lead , and all judgment from a fellow 's experi- ence went for nothing . Horses , riders , people , were all blown about like ships at sea . Three booths were blown over , and the wretched folk inside crawled out upon their hands and knees ; and in the next field were as many as a dozen hats at one time . Aye , Pimpernel regularly stuck fast , when about sixty yards off , and when I saw Policy stepping on , it did knock my heart against the lining of my ribs , I assure you , my love ! "
107436	107443	107159	107159	he	2237	" And you mean , Frank . "
107464	107520	107564	107564	she	2243	" that you have lost more than a hundred pounds in a month by this dreadful horse - racing ? O , Frank , it is cruel ; it is foolish of you to take away my money so . We shall have to leave the farm ; that will be the end of it ! "
107521	107544	107577	107577	she	2243	" Humbug about cruel . Now , there ' tis again - turn on the waterworks ; that 's just like you . "
107545	107563	107159	107159	he	2237	" But you 'll promise me not to go to Budmouth second meeting , wo n't you ? "
107583	107612	107159	107159	he	2237	" I do n't see why I should ; in fact , if it turns out to be a fine day , I was thinking of taking you . "
107613	107638	107723	107723	she	2243	" Never , never ! I 'll go a hundred miles the other way first . I hate the sound of the very word ! "
107639	107703	107723	107723	she	2243	" But the question of going to see the race or staying at home has very little to do with the matter . Bets are all booked safely enough before the race begins , you may depend . Whether it is a bad race for me or a good one , will have very little to do with our going there next Monday . "
107704	107722	107963	107964	The woman	3527	" But you do n't mean to say that you have risked anything on this one too ! "
107731	107795	108009	108009	He	243	" There now , do n't you be a little fool . Wait till you are told . Why , Bathsheba , you have lost all the pluck and sauciness you formerly had , and upon my life if I had known what a chicken - hearted creature you were under all your boldness , I 'd never have - i know what . "
107943	107962	108085	108085	Bathsheba	243	" Please , sir , do you know at what time Casterbridge Union - house closes at night ? "
108014	108020	108106	108106	Troy	243	" I do n't know . "
108077	108083	108106	108106	Troy	243	" O , poor thing ! "
108092	108104	108151	108151	gig	2257	" Stay where you are , and attend to the horse ! "
108117	108132	108151	108151	gig	2257	" Walk the horse to the top : I 'll see to the woman . "
108133	108137	108187	108187	Troy	243	" But I - "
108138	108147	108187	108187	Troy	243	" Do you hear ? Clk - Poppet ! "
108158	108185	108202	108202	he	243	" How on earth did you come here ? I thought you were miles away , or dead ! Why did n't you write to me ? "
108207	108212	108187	108187	Troy	243	" I feared to . "
108213	108219	108276	108276	he	243	" Have you any money ? "
108220	108223	108291	108291	Troy	243	" None . "
108224	108275	108291	108291	Troy	243	" Good Heaven - I wish I had more to give you ! Here 's - wretched - the merest trifle . It is every farthing I have left . I have none but what my wife gives me , you know , and I ca n't ask her now . "
108282	108289	108187	108187	Troy	243	" I have only another moment . "
108293	108309	108291	108291	Troy	243	" and now listen . Where are you going to - night ? Casterbridge Union ? "
108310	108319	108531	108532	Bath- sheba	168	" Yes ; I thought to go there . "
108320	108437	108545	108545	he	243	" You sha n't go there ; yet , wait . Yes , perhaps for to - night ; I can do nothing better - worse luck ! Sleep there to - night , and stay there to - morrow . Monday is the first free day I have ; and on Monday morning , at ten exactly , meet me on Grey 's Bridge just out of the town . I 'll bring all the money I can muster . You sha n't want - i'll see that , Fanny ; then I 'll get you a lodging somewhere . Good - bye till then . I am a brute - but good - bye ! "
108520	108529	108562	108562	she	168	" Do you know who that woman was ? "
108540	108544	108562	108562	she	168	" I do . "
108554	108560	108601	108601	he	243	" I thought you did . "
108573	108578	108601	108601	he	243	" Who is she ? "
108593	108600	108562	108562	she	168	" Nothing to either of us . "
108604	108611	108562	108562	she	168	" I know her by sight . "
108612	108618	108601	108601	he	243	" What is her name ? "
108619	108627	108562	108562	she	168	" How should I know her name ? "
108628	108634	108841	108841	she	3527	" I think you do . "
108635	108645	108841	108841	she	3527	" Think if you will , and be - - "
108832	108840	109081	109081	she	2279	" If I could only get there ! "
108844	108868	109764	109765	the woman	3527	" Meet him the day after to - morrow : God help me ! Perhaps I shall be in my grave before then . "
109076	109080	109774	109774	she	2279	" Two more ! "
109757	109763	109774	109774	she	2279	" Less than a mile ! "
109768	109773	109817	109817	she	2279	" No ; more . "
109781	109813	109920	109920	She	2279	" The mile is to the county hall , and my resting - place is on the other side Casterbridge . A little over a mile , and there I am ! "
109821	109859	110014	110014	she	2279	" Five or six steps to a yard - six perhaps . I have to go seventeen hundred yards . A hundred times six , six hundred . Seventeen times that . O pity me , Lord ! "
109928	109953	110027	110027	She	2279	" I 'll believe that the end lies five posts for- ward , and no further , and so get strength to pass them . "
109989	110013	110040	110040	She	2279	" I 'll pass five more by believing my longed - for spot is at the next fifth . I can do it . "
110019	110026	110056	110056	she	2279	" It lies only five further . "
110032	110039	110104	110104	she	2279	" But it is five further . "
110044	110055	110104	110104	she	2279	" That stone bridge is the end of my journey . "
110094	110103	110385	110385	she	2279	" Now for the truth of the matter . "
110110	110124	110701	110701	She	2279	" The truth is , that I have less than half a mile . "
110380	110384	111375	111376	The Lord	2359	" No further ! "
110685	110700	111392	111394	the overcome traveller	2360	" Perhaps I can make use of him - I might do it then ! "
111367	111374	111392	111394	the overcome traveller	2360	" said one of the women . "
111379	111390	111392	111394	the overcome traveller	2360	" said the other . There is a dog outside , "
111396	111406	111554	111554	you	243	" Where is he gone ? He helped me . "
111412	111550	111571	111571	she	2361	" said the man . The little procession then moved forward - the man in front bearing the light , the two bony women next , supporting between them the small and supple one . Thus they entered the house and disappeared . CHAPTER XLI SUSPICION - FANNY IS SENT FOR BATHSHEBA said very little to her husband all that evening of their return from market , and he was not disposed to say much to her . He exhibited the un- pleasant combination of a restless condition with a silent tongue . The next day , which was Sunday , passed nearly in the same manner as regarded their taciturnity , Bathsheba going to church both morning and afternoon . This was the day before the Budmouth races . In the evening Troy said , suddenly - "
111561	111567	111623	111623	Troy	243	" Her countenance instantly sank . "
111574	111584	111663	111663	he	243	" The fact is , I want it badly . "
111612	111622	111663	111663	he	243	" Ah ! for those races to - morrow . "
111651	111662	111663	111663	he	243	" Well , suppose I do want it for races ? "
111669	111674	111917	111917	he	243	" O , Frank ! "
111690	111787	111927	111927	she	3527	" Only such a few weeks ago you said that I was far sweeter than all your other pleasures put together , and that you would give them all up for me ; and now , wo n't you give up this one , which is more a worry than a pleasure ? Do , Frank . Come , let me fascinate you by all I can do - by pretty words and pretty looks , and everything I can think of - to stay at home . Say yes to your wife - say yes ! "
111904	111916	111945	111945	Troy	244	" The money is not wanted for racing debts at all , "
111920	111926	111994	111994	you	3527	" What is it for ? "
111930	111944	111994	111994	you	3527	" You worry me a great deal by these mysterious responsibilities , Frank . "
111975	111988	112080	112080	She	0	" You wrong me by such a suspicious manner , he said . "
112009	112010	112090	112090	she	0	" "
112026	112079	112090	112090	she	0	" she said , with features between a smile and a pout . Exactly ; and , the former being done , suppose we proceed to the latter . Bathsheba , fun is all very well , but do n't go too far , or you may have cause to regret something . "
112083	112089	112207	112207	She	2368	" I do that already . "
112094	112100	112207	112207	She	2368	" What do you regret ? "
112102	112112	112207	112207	She	2368	" That my romance has come to an end . "
112113	112120	112207	112207	She	2368	" All romances end at marriage . "
112121	112144	112207	112207	She	2368	" I wish you would n't talk like that . You grieve me to my soul by being smart at my expense . "
112145	112159	112207	112207	She	2368	" You are dull enough at mine . I believe you hate me . "
112160	112173	112207	112207	She	2368	" Not you - only your faults . I do hate them . "
112174	112206	112207	112207	She	2368	" ' Twould be much more becoming if you set your- self to cure them . Come , let 's strike a balance with the twenty pounds , and be friends . "
112214	112234	112207	112207	She	2368	" I have about that sum here for household expenses . If you must have it , take it . "
112235	112259	112207	112207	She	2368	" Very good . Thank you . I expect I shall have gone away before you are in to breakfast to - morrow . "
112260	112317	112425	112425	she	2369	" And must you go ? Ah ! there was a time , Frank , when it would have taken a good many promises to other people to drag you away from me . You used to call me darling , then . But it does n't matter to you how my days are passed now . "
112318	112328	112425	112425	she	2369	" I must go , in spite of sentiment . "
112416	112424	112445	112445	He	244	" A woman 's curl of hair ! "
112428	112437	112425	112425	she	2369	" O , Frank , whose is that ? "
112461	112483	112503	112503	he	244	" Why , yours , of course . Whose should it be ? I had quite forgotten that I had it . "
112484	112492	112503	112503	he	244	" What a dreadful fib , Frank ! "
112493	112502	112425	112425	she	2369	" I tell you I had forgotten it ! "
112508	112520	112425	112425	she	2369	" I do n't mean that - it was yellow hair . "
112521	112524	112425	112425	she	2369	" Nonsense . "
112525	112547	112503	112503	he	244	" That 's insulting me . I know it was yellow . Now whose was it ? I want to know . "
112548	112580	112425	112425	she	2369	" Very well I 'll tell you , so make no more ado . It is the hair of a young woman I was going to marry before I knew you . "
112581	112592	112425	112425	she	2369	" You ought to tell me her name , then . "
112593	112600	112503	112503	he	244	" I can not do that . "
112601	112607	112425	112425	she	2369	" Is she married yet ? "
112608	112611	112425	112425	she	2369	" No . "
112612	112617	112503	112503	he	244	" Is she alive ? "
112618	112621	112425	112425	she	2369	" Yes . "
112622	112627	112425	112425	she	2369	" Is she pretty ? "
112628	112631	112658	112658	he	244	" Yes . "
112632	112650	112658	112658	he	244	" It is wonderful how she can be , poor thing , under such an awful affliction ! "
112651	112657	112683	112683	Troy	244	" Affliction - what affliction ? "
112663	112671	112683	112683	Troy	244	" Having hair of that dreadful colour . "
112672	112681	112748	112748	she	2370	" Oh - ho - i like that ! "
112689	112735	112748	112748	she	2370	" Why , her hair has been admired by everybody who has seen her since she has worn it loose , which has not been long . It is beautiful hair . People used to turn their heads to look at it , poor girl ! "
112736	112747	112816	112816	Troy	243	" Pooh ! that 's nothing - that 's nothing ! "
112758	112782	112854	112854	she	2370	" If I cared for your love as much as I used to I could say people had turned to look at mine . "
112783	112815	112973	112973	Troy	243	" Bathsheba , do n't be so fitful and jealous . You knew what married life would be like , and should n't have entered it if you feared these contingencies . "
112859	112960	112854	112854	she	2370	" This is all I get for loving you so well ! Ah ! when I married you your life was dearer to me than my own . I would have died for you - how truly I can say that I would have died for you ! And now you sneer at my foolishness in marrying you . O ! is it kind to me to throw my mistake in my face ? Whatever opinion you may have of my wisdom , you should not tell me of it so mercilessly , now that I am in your power . "
112961	112971	113011	113011	Frank	244	" I ca n't help how things fall out . "
112975	112988	113016	113016	he	244	" upon my heart , women will be the death of me ! "
112989	113010	113056	113056	she	2371	" Well you should n't keep people 's hair . You 'll burn it , wo n't you , Frank ? "
113022	113052	113056	113056	she	2371	" There are considerations even before my consideration for you ; reparations to be made - ties you know nothing of If you repent of marrying , so do I. "
113074	113118	113056	113056	she	2371	" I only repent it if you do n't love me better than any woman in the world ! I do n't otherwise , Frank . You do n't repent because you already love somebody better than you love me , do you ? "
113119	113131	113056	113056	she	2371	" I do n't know . Why do you say that ? "
113132	113188	113056	113056	she	2371	" You wo n't burn that curl . You like the woman who owns that pretty hair - yes ; it is pretty - more beautiful than my miserable black mane ! Well , it is no use ; I ca n't help being ugly . You must like her best , if you will ! "
113189	113223	113056	113056	she	2371	" Until to - day , when I took it from a drawer , I have never looked upon that bit of hair for several months - that I am ready to swear . "
113224	113230	113056	113056	she	2371	" But just now you said "
113233	113242	113056	113056	she	2371	" and then - that woman we met ? "
113243	113257	113056	113056	she	2371	" ' Twas the meeting with her that reminded me of the hair . "
113258	113265	113056	113056	she	2371	" Is it hers , then ? "
113266	113287	113056	113056	she	2371	" Yes . There , now that you have wormed it out of me , I hope you are content . "
113288	113295	113314	113314	she	2372	" And what are the ties ? "
113296	113307	113369	113369	she	2372	" Oh ! that meant nothing - a mere jest . "
113308	113313	113369	113369	she	2372	" A mere jest ! "
113321	113368	113456	113456	he	2373	" Can you jest when I am so wretchedly in earnest ? Tell me the truth , Frank . I am not a fool , you know , although I am a woman , and have my woman 's moments . Come ! treat me fairly . "
113380	113439	114241	114241	she	2408	" I do n't want much ; bare justice - that 's all ! Ah ! once I felt I could be content with nothing less than the highest homage from the husband I should choose . Now , anything short of cruelty will content me . Yes ! the independent and spirited Bathsheba is come to this ! "
113440	113449	114269	114269	Bathsheba	243	" For Heaven 's sake do n't be so desperate!"Troy
114230	114240	114244	114244	He	188	" Well , what 's the message , Joseph ? "
114274	114290	114244	114244	He	188	" You 'll never see Fanny Robin no more - use nor principal - ma'am . "
114291	114294	114269	114269	Bathsheba	243	" Why ? "
114295	114304	114244	114244	He	188	" Because she 's dead in the Union . "
114305	114311	114244	114244	He	188	" Fanny dead - never ! "
114312	114317	114269	114269	Bathsheba	243	" Yes , ma'am . "
114318	114325	114244	114244	He	188	" What did she die from ? "
114326	114437	114514	114514	she	2410	" I do n't know for certain ; but I should be inclined to think it was from general weakness of constitution . She was such a limber maid that ' a could stand no hardship , even when I knowed her , and ' a went like a candle - snoff , so ' tis said . She was took bad in the morning , and , being quite feeble and worn out , she died in the evening . She belongs by law to our parish ; and Mr. Boldwood is going to send a waggon at three this afternoon to fetch her home here and bury her . "
114438	114503	114269	114269	Bathsheba	243	" Indeed I shall not let Mr. Boldwood do any such thing - i shall do it ! Fanny was my uncle 's servant , and , although I only knew her for a couple of days , FANNY IS SENT FOR she belongs to me . How very , very sad this is ! - the idea of Fanny being in a workhouse . "
114520	114564	114583	114583	she	2410	" Send across to Mr. Boldwood 's , and say that Mrs. Troy will take upon herself the duty of fetching an old servant of the family .... We ought not to put her in a waggon ; we 'll get a hearse . "
114565	114577	114583	114583	she	2410	" There will hardly be time , ma'am , will there ? "
114578	114582	114269	114269	Bathsheba	243	" Perhaps not . "
114588	114603	114269	114269	Bathsheba	243	" When did you say we must be at the door - three o'clock ? "
114604	114617	114583	114583	she	2410	" Three o'clock this afternoon , ma'am , so to speak it . "
114618	114666	114269	114269	Bathsheba	243	" Very well - you go with it . A pretty waggon is better than an ugly hearse , after all . Joseph , have the new spring waggon with the blue body and red wheels , and wash it very clean . And , Joseph - - "
114667	114672	114796	114796	me	0	" Yes , ma'am . "
114673	114739	114803	114803	Fanny	217	" Carry with you some evergreens and flowers to put upon her coffin - indeed , gather a great many , and completely bury her in them . Get some boughs of laurustinus , and variegated box , and yew , and boy'siove ; ay , and some hunches of chrysanthemum . And let old Pleasant draw her , because she knew him so well . "I
114793	114794	114834	114834	she	217	" "
114808	114814	114834	114834	she	217	" said Bathsheba , musing . "
114838	114839	114854	114854	she	217	" "
114848	114849	114995	114995	ma'am	712	" "

115049	115061	115108	115108	she	217	" she said , in a suddenly restless and eager voice . "
115093	115094	115108	115108	she	217	" "
115112	115113	115108	115108	she	217	" "

115131	115136	115108	115108	she	217	" Certainly , ma'am . "
115137	115155	115210	115210	She	217	" Joseph , come hither a moment . What was the colour of Fanny Robin 's hair ? "
115156	115187	115310	115310	Bathsheba	243	" Really , mistress , now that ' tis put to me so judge- and - jury like , I ca n't call to mind , if ye'll believe me ! "
115188	115209	115307	115307	she	217	" Never mind ; go on and do what I told you . Stop - well no , go on . "
115316	115325	115307	115307	she	217	" Whose sweetheart did you say , Joseph ? "
115326	115334	115307	115307	she	217	" I do n't know , ma'am . "
115335	115341	115307	115307	she	217	" Are you quite sure ? "
115342	115350	115650	115650	She	217	" Yes , ma'am , quite sure . "Sure
115354	115355	115675	115675	he	144	" "
115638	115639	115650	115650	She	217	" "
115662	115674	115726	115726	she	217	" Not a word , mistress , I assure ' ee ! "
115678	115689	115742	115742	Joseph	188	" Hardly anybody in the parish knows the news yet . "
115690	115718	115742	115742	Joseph	188	" I wonder why Gabriel did n't bring the message to me himself . He mostly makes a point of seeing me upon the most trifling errand . "
115733	115741	115650	115650	She	217	" Perhaps he was busy , ma'am . "
115745	115792	115742	115742	Joseph	188	" And sometimes he seems to suffer from things upon his mind , connected with the time when he was better off than ' a is now . ' A 's rather a curious item , but a very understanding shepherd , and learned in books . "
115793	115809	115650	115650	She	217	" Did anything seem upon his mind whilst he was speaking to you about this ? "
115810	115833	115870	115870	she	217	" I can not but say that there did , ma'am . He was terrible down , and so was Farmer Boldwood . "
115834	115854	115870	115870	she	217	" Thank you , Joseph . That will do . Go on now , or you 'll be late . "
115883	115914	115870	115870	she	217	" What was the colour of poor Fanny Robin 's hair ? Do you know ? I can not recollect - i only saw her for a day or two . "
115915	115969	115870	115870	she	217	" It was light , ma'am ; but she wore it rather short , and packed away under her cap , so that you would hardly notice it . But I have seen her let it down when she was going to bed , and it looked beautiful then . Real golden hair . "
115970	115982	116011	116011	he	304	" Her young man was a soldier , was he not ? "
115983	116002	116038	116038	He	304	" Yes . In the same regiment as Mr. Troy . He says he knew him very well . "What
116016	116017	116011	116011	he	304	" "
116041	116071	116038	116038	He	304	" O yes , he knew the young man as well as he knew himself , and that there was n't a man in the regiment he liked better . "
116072	116081	116125	116125	Bathsheba	243	" Ah ! Said that , did he ? "
116082	116111	116404	116405	Joseph Poorgrass	196	" Yes ; and he said there was a strong likeness be- tween himself and the other young man , so that some- times people mistook them - - "

117623	117631	117669	117669	Joseph	196	" Why , ' tis neighbour Poorgrass ! "
117636	117652	117669	117669	Joseph	196	" I 'm sure your face do n't praise your mistress 's table , Joseph . "
117653	117667	117741	117741	Coggan	180	" I 've had a very pale companion for the last four miles . "
117680	117726	117769	117769	he	196	" And to speak the truth , ' twas beginning to tell upon me . I assure ye , I ha'n't seed the colour of victuals or drink since breakfast time this morning , and that was no more than a dew - bit afield . "
117727	117739	117811	117811	Jan	180	" Then drink , Joseph , and do n't restrain yourself ! "
117774	117799	117880	117880	Poorgrass	196	" ' Tis pretty drinking - very pretty drinking , and is more than cheerful on my melancholy errand , so to speak it . "
117800	117809	117880	117880	Poorgrass	196	" True , drink is a pleasant delight . "
117869	117878	118233	118234	the Lord	835	" Well , I must be on again . "
117882	117908	117880	117880	Poorgrass	196	" Not but that I should like another nip with ye ; but the parish might lose confidence in me if I was seed here . "
117909	117924	117880	117880	Poorgrass	196	" Where be ye trading o't to to - day , then , Joseph ? "
117925	117958	118233	118234	the Lord	835	" Back to Weatherbury . I 've got poor little Fanny Robin in my waggon outside , and I must be at the churchyard gates at a quarter to five with her . "
117959	117993	117880	117880	Poorgrass	196	" Ay - i've heard of it . And so she 's nailed up in parish boards after all , and nobody to pay the bell shilling and the grave half - crown . "
117994	118040	117880	117880	Poorgrass	196	" The parish pays the grave half - crown , but not the bell shilling , because the bell 's a luxery : but ' a can hardly do without the grave , poor body . However , I expect our mistress will pay all . "
118041	118088	117880	117880	Poorgrass	196	" A pretty maid as ever I see ! But what 's yer hurry , Joseph ? The pore woman 's dead , and you ca n't bring her to life , and you may as well sit down comfortable , and finish another with us . "
118089	118122	117880	117880	Poorgrass	196	" I do n't mind taking just the least thimbleful ye can dream of more with ye , sonnies . But only a few minutes , because ' tis as ' tis . "
118123	118221	118282	118282	they	2510	" Of course , you 'll have another drop . A man 's twice the man afterwards . You feel so warm and glorious , and you whop and slap at your work without any trouble , and everything goes on like sticks a- breaking . Too much liquor is bad , and leads us to that horned man in the smoky house ; but after all , many people have n't the gift of enjoying a wet , and since we be highly favoured with a power that way , we should make the most o't .

118659	118669	118711	118711	Chapelfolk	360	" said Mark Clark , with cor- roborative feeling ; "

119058	119207	119222	119222	Joseph	188	" The longer Joseph Poorgrass remained , the less his spirit was troubled by the duties which devolved upon him this afternoon . The minutes glided by uncounted , until the evening shades began perceptibly to deepen , and the eyes of the three were but sparkling points on the surface of darkness . Coggan 's repeater struck six from his pocket in the usual still small tones . At that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry , and the door opened to admit the figure of Gabriel Oak , followed by the maid of the inn bearing a candle . He stared sternly at the one lengthy and two round faces of the sitters , which confronted him with the expressions of a fiddle and a couple of warming - pans . Joseph Poor- grass blinked , and shrank several inches into the back- ground . "
119226	119232	119296	119296	shepherd	3738	" said Gabriel , indignantly . "
119249	119289	119322	119322	Nobody	439	" Coggan looked up indefinitely at Oak , one or other of his eyes occasionally opening and closing of its own accord , as if it were not a member , but a dozy individual with a distinct personality . "
119298	119321	119485	119485	We	2556	" said Mark Clark , looking reproachfully at the candle , which appeared to possess special features of interest for his eyes . "
119329	119342	119485	119485	We	2556	" at length said Coggan , with the precision of a machine . "

119488	119608	119656	119657	Shepherd Oak	192	" added Mark Clark , emphatically , at once drinking himself , to run no further risk of losing his chance by the event alluded to , Jan meanwhile merging his additional thoughts of to - morrow in a song : - To - mor - row , to - mor - row ! And while peace and plen - ty I find at my board , With a heart free from sick - ness and sor - row , With my friends will I share what to - day may af - ford , And let them spread the ta - ble to - mor - row . To - mor - row ' , to - mor - "
119616	119625	119715	119716	Mark Clark	178	" said Oak ; and turning upon Poorgrass , "

119703	119713	119782	119782	he	196	" A multiplying eye is a very bad thing . "

119743	119781	119915	119915	God	171	" Yes ; I see two of every sort , as if I were some holy man living in the times of King Noah and entering into the ark .... Y - y - y - yes . "
119803	119851	119782	119782	he	196	" I feel too good for England : I ought to have lived in Genesis by rights , like the other men of sacrifice , and then I should n't have b - b - been called a d - d - drunkard in such a way ! "
119852	119870	119915	119915	God	171	" I wish you 'd show yourself a man of spirit , and not sit whining there ! "
119871	119913	120011	120011	Jan.	198	" Show myself a man of spirit ? ... Ah , well ! let me take the name of drunkard humbly - iet me be a man of contrite knees - iet it be ! l know that I always do say "

Hah , yes ! ... But not a man of spirit ? Have I ever allowed the toe of pride to be lifted against my hinder parts without groaning manfully that I question the right to do so ? I inquire that query boldly ? "
119997	120009	120310	120311	A man	3474	" We ca n't say that you have , Hero Poorgrass , "
120012	120058	120359	120359	Gabriel	144	" Never have I allowed such treatment to pass un- questioned ! Yet the shepherd says in the face of that rich testimony that I be not a man of spirit ! Well , let it pass by , and death is a kind friend ! "
120330	120338	120359	120359	Gabriel	144	" Is that Poorgrass with the corpse ? "
120349	120357	120413	120413	Gabriel	144	" The corpse is here , sir . "
120361	120407	120413	120413	Gabriel	144	" I have just been to inquire of Mrs. Troy if she could tell me the reason of the delay . I am afraid it is too late now for the funeral to be performed with proper decency . Have you the registrar 's certificate ? "
120408	120411	120501	120501	Gabriel	144	" No . "
120415	120439	120721	120721	she	4518	" I expect Poorgrass has that ; and he 's at the Buck 's Head . I forgot to ask him for it . "
120440	120500	120721	120721	she	4518	" Then that settles the matter . We 'll put off the funeral till to - morrow morning . The body may be brought on to the church , or it may be left here at the farm and fetched by the bearers in the morning . They waited more than an hour , and have now gone home . "
120713	120720	120721	120721	she	4518	" It is unkind and unchristian . "
120724	120738	121075	121076	Fanny Robin	217	" to leave the poor thing in a coach - house all night . "
120744	120749	121078	121078	child	1228	" said the parson . "
120832	121074	121078	121078	child	1228	" The parson 's words spread into the heavy air with a sad yet unperturbed cadence , and Gabriel shed an honest tear . Bathsheba seemed unmoved . Mr. Thirdly then left them , and Gabriel lighted a lantern . Fetching three other men to assist him , they bore the unconscious truant indoors , placing the coffin on two benches in the middle of a little sitting - room next the hall , as Bathsheba directed . Every one except Gabriel Oak then left the room . He still indecisively lingered beside the body . He was deeply troubled at the wretchedly ironical aspect that circumstances were putting on with regard to Troy 's wife , and at his own powerlessness to counteract them , n spite of his careful manoeuvring all this day , the very worst event that could in any way have happened in connection with the burial had happened now . Oak imagined a terrible discovery resulting from this after- noon 's work that might cast over Bathsheba 's life a shade which the interposition of many lapsing years might but indifferently lighten , and which nothing at all might altogether remove . Suddenly , as in a last attempt to save Bathsheba from , at any rate , immediate anguish , he looked again , as he had looked before , at the chalk writing upon the coffinlid . The scrawl was this simple one , "
121080	121098	121126	121126	you	2596	" Gabriel took his handkerchief and carefully rubbed out the two latter words , leaving visible the inscription "
121101	121124	121184	121184	Liddy	191	" only . He then left the room , and went out quietly by the front door . CHAPTER XLIII FANNY 'S REVENGE "
121133	121177	121222	121222	She	217	" inquired Liddy , at a later hour the same evening , standing by the door with a chamber candlestick in her hand and addressing Bathsheba , who sat cheerless and alone in the large parlour beside the first fire of the season . "

121248	121249	121323	121323	I	0	" "

121318	121319	121344	121344	Liddy	191	" "
121325	121331	121400	121400	Liddy	191	" said Bathsheba , desultorily . "
121346	121366	121427	121427	She	0	" She suddenly exclaimed in an impulsive and excited whisper , Have you heard anything strange said of Fanny ? "
121391	121398	121427	121427	She	0	" No - not a word ! "
121410	121426	121681	121681	she	191	" What is it makes you cry so , ma'am ; has anything hurt you ? "
121440	121475	121681	121681	she	191	" No , Liddy - i do n't want you any more . I can hardly say why I have taken to crying lately : I never used to cry . Good - night . "
121715	121716	121737	121737	Fanny	217	" "
121721	121722	121737	121737	Fanny	217	" "

121773	121815	121816	121816	I	0	" Liddy came close to her mistress and whispered the remainder of the sentence slowly into her ear , inclining her head as she spoke in the direction of the room where Fanny lay . Bathsheba trembled from head to foot . "
121822	121828	121875	121875	you	712	" she said , excitedly . "
121842	121843	122487	122487	he	2618	" "
121881	121882	123038	123038	her	2619	" "
121890	122486	123114	123114	she	2619	" Bathsheba turned and looked into the fire , that Liddy might not see her face . Finding that her mistress was going to say no more , Liddy glided out , closed the door softly , and went to bed . Bathsheba 's face , as she continued looking into the fire that evening , might have excited solicitousness on her account even among those who loved her least . The sadness of Fanny Robin 's fate did not make Bath- sheba 's glorious , although she was the Esther to this poor Vashti , and their fates might be supposed to stand in some respects as contrasts to each other . When Liddy came into the room a second time the beautiful eyes which met hers had worn a listless , weary look- When she went out after telling the story they had ex- pressed wretchedness in full activity . Her simple country nature , fed on old - fashioned principles , was troubled by that which would have troubled a woman of the world very little , both Fanny and her child , if she had one , being dead . Bathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection between her own history and the dimly suspected tragedy of Fanny 's end which Oak and Boldwood never for a moment credited her with possessing . The meeting with the lonely woman on the previous Saturday night had been unwitnessed and unspoken of . Oak may have had the best of intentions in withholding for as many days as possible the details of what had happened to Fanny ; but had he known that Bathsheba 's perceptions had already been exercised in the matter , he would have done nothing to lengthen the minutes of suspense she was now undergoing , when the certainty which must terminate it would be the worst fact suspected after all . She suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some one stronger than herself , and so get strength to sustain her surmised position with dignity and her lurking doubts with stoicism . Where could she find such a friend ? nowhere in the house . She was by far the coolest of the women under her roof . Patience and suspension of judgement for a few hours were what she wanted to learn , and there was nobody to teach her . Might she but go to Gabriel Oak ! - but that could not be . What a way Oak had , she thought , of enduring things . Boldwood , who seemed so much deeper and higher and stronger in feeling than Gabriel , had not yet learnt , any more than she herself , the simple lesson which Oak showed a mastery of by every turn and look he gave - that among the multitude of interests by which he was surrounded , those which affected his personal wellbeing were not the most absorbing and important in his eyes . Oak meditatively looked upon the horizon of circumstances without any special regard to his own standpoint in the midst . That was how she would wish to be . But then Oak was not racked by incertitude upon the inmost matter of his bosom , as she was at this moment . Oak knew all about Fanny that he wished to know - she felt convinced of that . If she were to go to him now at once and say no more than these few words,!What is the truth of the story ? "
123053	123107	123219	123219	herself	2619	" Would to God you would speak and tell me your secret , Fanny ! . , . O , I hope , hope it is not true that there are two of you ! ... If I could only look in upon you for one little minute , I should know all ! "
123119	123123	123432	123432	she	2619	" And I will "
123229	123244	123650	123650	she	2619	" It was best to know the worst , and I know it now ! "
123424	123431	124247	124247	Troy	243	" Oh - h - h ! "
123666	123888	124265	124265	herself	243	" Burning for burning ; wound for wound : strife for strife . Bathsheba indulged in contemplations of escape from her position by immediate death , which thought she , though it was an inconvenient and awful way , had limits to its inconvenience and awfulness that could not be overpassed ; whilst the shames of life were measureless . Yet even this scheme of extinction by death was out tamely copying her rival 's method without the reasons which had glorified it in her rival 's case . She glided rapidly up and down the room , as was mostly her habit hen excited , her hands hanging clasped in front of her , as she thought and in part expressed in broken words : O , I hate her , yet I do n't mean that I hate her , for it is grievous and wicked ; and yet I hate her a little ! yes , my flesh insists upon hating her , whether my spirit is willing or no ! ... If she had only lived , I could ave been angry and cruel towards her with some justifi- cation ; but to be vindictive towards a poor dead woman recoils upon myself . O God , have mercy , ! I am miserable at all this ! "
124240	124245	124303	124303	Troy	243	" Well - what ? "
124251	124260	124321	124321	she	2646	" I must go ! I must go ! "
124286	124301	124321	124321	she	2646	" What 's the matter , in God 's name ? who 's dead ? "
124305	124320	124488	124488	Bathsheba	243	" I can not say ; let me go out . I want air ! "
124324	124333	124510	124510	Troy	243	" But no ; stay , I insist ! "
124480	124486	124510	124510	Troy	243	" Do you know her ? "
124504	124508	124523	124523	He	243	" I do . "
124512	124517	124806	124806	her	217	" Is it she ? "
124518	124522	124995	124995	he	243	" It is . "
124823	124872	125090	125090	she	217	" Do n't - do n't kiss them ! O , Frank , I ca n't bear it - i ca n't ! I love you better than she did : kiss me too , Frank - kiss me ! You will , Frank , kiss me too ! "
124987	124994	125124	125124	he	243	" I will not kiss you ! "
125079	125089	125124	125124	he	243	" What have you to say as your reason ? "
125106	125123	125186	125186	He	243	" I have to say that I have been a bad , black - hearted man . "

From her feet , and between the beautiful yellowing ferns with their feathery arms , the ground sloped downwards to a hollow , in which was a species of swamp , dotted with fungi . A morning mist hung over it now - a fulsome yet magnificent silvery veil , full of light from the sun , yet semi - opaque - the hedge behind it being in some measure hidden by its hazy luminousness . Up the sides of this depression grew sheaves of the common rush , and here and there a peculiar species of flag , the blades of which glistened in the emerging sun , like scythes . But the general aspect of the swamp was malignant . From its moist and poisonous coat seemed to be exhaled the essences of evil things in the earth , and in the waters under the earth . The fungi grew in all manner of positions from rotting leaves and tree stumps , some exhibiting to her listless gaze their clammy tops , others their oozing gills . Some were marked with great splotches , red as arterial blood , others were saffron yellow , and others tall and attenuated , with stems like macaroni . Some were leathery and of richest browns . The hollow seemed a nursery of pestilences small and great , in the immediate neighbourhood of comfort and health , and Bathsheba arose with a tremor at the thought of having passed the night on the brink of so dismal a place . "

126358	126589	126663	126663	You	712	" Other words followed to the same effect . The boy was of the dunce class apparently ; the book was a psalter , and this was his way of learning the collect . In the worst attacks of trouble there appears to be always a super- ficial film of consciousness which is left disengaged and open to the notice of trifles , and Bathsheba was faintly amused at the boy 's method , till he too passed on . By this time stupor had given place to anxiety , and anxiety began to make room for hunger and thirst . A form now appeared upon the rise on the other side of the swamp , half - hidden by the mist , and came towards Bathsheba . The woman - for it was a woman - approached with her face askance , as if looking earnestly on all sides of her . When she got a little further round to the left , and drew nearer , Bathsheba could see the newcomer 's profile against the sunny sky ' , and knew the wavy sweep from forehead to chin , with neither angle nor decisive line anywhere about it , to be the familiar contour of Liddy Smallbury . Bathsheba 's heart bounded with gratitude in the thought that she was not altogether deserted , and she jumped up . "
126594	126636	126663	126663	You	712	" she said , or attempted to say ; but the words had only been framed by her lips ; there came no sound . She had lost her voice by exposure to the clogged atmosphere all these hours of night . "
126650	126662	126716	126716	I	0	" said the girl , as soon as she saw Bathsheba . "
126669	126709	126663	126663	You	712	" Bathsheba said in a whisper , which she vainly endeavoured to make loud enough to reach Liddy 's ears . Liddy , not knowing this , stepped down upon the swamp , saying , as she did so , "
126719	126810	126857	126857	Bathsheba	243	" Bathsheba never forgot that transient little picture of Liddy crossing the swamp to her there in the morning light . Iridescent bubbles of dank subter- ranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside the waiting maid 's feet as she trod , hissing as they burst and expanded away to join the vapoury firmament above . Liddy did not sink , as Bathsheba had anticipated . She landed safely on the other side , and looked up at the beautiful though pale and weary face of her young mistress . "
126814	126837	126857	126857	Bathsheba	243	" said Liddy , with tears in her eyes , Do hearten yourself up a little , ma'am . However did - - "
126838	126855	126663	126663	You	712	" I ca n't speak above a whisper - my voice is gone for the present . "
126861	126889	126663	126663	You	712	" I suppose the damp air from that hollow has taken it away Liddy , do n't question me , mind . Who sent you - anybody ? "
126890	126930	126857	126857	Bathsheba	243	" Nobody . I thought , when I found you were not at home , that something cruel had happened . I fancy I heard his voice late last night ; and so , knowing something was wrong - - "
126931	126937	126663	126663	You	712	" Is he at home ? "
126938	126949	126663	126663	You	712	" No ; he left just before I came out . "
126950	126956	126991	126991	Liddy	191	" Is Fanny taken away ? "
126957	126970	127008	127008	they	2697	" Not yet . She will soon be - at nine o'clock . "
126971	126990	126663	126663	You	712	" we wo n't go home at present , then . Suppose we walk about in this wood ? "
127016	127039	126663	126663	You	712	" But you had better come in , ma'am , and have something to eat . You will die of a chill ! "
127040	127051	127083	127083	Liddy	191	" I shall not come indoors yet - perhaps never . "
127052	127074	127128	127128	Bathsheba	243	" Shall I get you something to eat , and something else to put over your head besides that little shawl ? "
127075	127082	127135	127136	her companion	3490	" If you will , Liddy . "
127121	127126	127178	127178	she	191	" Is Fanny gone ? "
127130	127133	127212	127212	She	191	" No . "
127169	127177	127236	127236	She	191	" Now we 'll walk about again . "
127216	127227	127260	127260	she	191	" l wonder if Fanny is gone by this time ? "
127228	127235	127292	127292	Liddy	191	" I will go and see . "
127277	127287	127292	127292	Liddy	191	" Then they think I am in my bedroom ? "
127288	127291	127260	127260	she	191	" Yes . "
127298	127322	127520	127520	Liddy,-taking	366	" You said when I first found you that you might never go home again - you did n't mean it , ma'am ? "
127323	127507	127520	127520	Liddy,-taking	366	" No ; I 've altered my mind . It is only women with no pride in them who run away from their husbands . There is one position worse than that of being found dead in your husband 's house from his ill usage , and that is , to be found alive through having gone away to The house of somebody else . I 've thought of it all this morning , and I 've chosen my course . A runaway wife is an encumbrance to everybody , a burden to herself and a byword - all of which make up a heap of misery greater than any that comes by staying at home - though this may include the trifling items of insult , beating , and starvation . Liddy , if ever you marry - God forbid that you ever should ! - you 'll find yourself in a fearful situation ; but mind this , do n't you flinch . Stand your ground , and be cut to pieces . That 's what I 'm going to do . "
127508	127518	127260	127260	she	191	" O , mistress , do n't talk so ! "
127524	127553	127605	127605	she	366	" but I knew you had too much sense to bide away . May I ask what dreadful thing it is that has happened between you and him ? "
127554	127565	127605	127605	she	366	" You may ask ; but I may not tell . "
127601	127604	127737	127737	Liddy	191	" Liddy . "
127623	127725	127737	127737	Liddy	191	" you are to be my confidante for the present - somebody must be - and I choose you . Well , I shall take up my abode here for a while . Will you get a fire lighted , put down a piece of carpet , and help me to make the place comfortable . Afterwards , I want you and Maryann to bring up that little stump bedstead in the small room , and the be belonging to it , and a table , and some other things . What shall I do to pass the heavy time away ? "
127726	127735	127605	127605	she	366	" Hemming handkerchiefs is a very good thing . "
127739	127753	127605	127605	she	366	" O no , no ! I hate needlework - i always did . "

Bathsheba sat at the window till sunset , sometimes attempting to read , at other times watching every movement outside without much purpose , and listening without much interest to every sound . The sun went down almost blood - red that night , and a livid cloud received its rays in the east . Up against this dark background the west front of the church tower - the only part of the edifice visible from the farm - house windows - rose distinct and lustrous , the vane upon the summit bristling with rays . Hereabouts , at six o'clock , the young men of the village gathered , as was their custom , for a game of Prisoners ' base . The spot had been consecrated to this ancient diversion from time immemorial , the old stocks conveniently forming a base facing the boundary of the churchyard , in front of which the ground was trodden hard and bare as a pavement by the players . She could see the brown and black heads of the young lads darting about right and left , their white shirt - sleeves gleaming in the sun ; whilst occasionally a shout and a peal of hearty laughter varied the stillness of the evening air . They continued playing for a quarter of an hour or so , when the game concluded abruptly , and the players leapt over the wall and vanished round to the other side behind a yew - tree , which was also half behind a beech , now spreading in one mass of golden foliage , on which the branches traced black lines .

This done he ascended the stairs , and throwing himself down upon the bed dressed as he was , he waited miser- ably for the morning . Fate had dealt grimly with him through the last four- and - twenty hours . His day had been spent in a way which varied very materially from his intentions regard- ing it . There is always an inertia to be overcome in striking out a new line of conduct - not more in our- selves , it seems , than in circumscribing events , which appear as if leagued together to allow no novelties in the way of amelioration . Twenty pounds having been secured from Bathsheba , he had managed to add to the sum every farthing he could muster on his own account , which had been seven pounds ten . With this money , twenty - seven pounds ten in all , he had hastily driven from the gate that morning to keep his appointment with Fanny Robin . On reaching Casterbridge he left the horse and trap at an inn , and at five minutes before ten came back to the bridge at the lower end of the town , and sat himself upon the parapet . The clocks struck the hour , and no Fanny appeared . In fact , at that moment she was being robed in her grave - clothes by two attendants at the Union poorhouse - the first and last tiring - women the gentle creature had ever been honoured with . The quarter went , the half hour . A rush of recollection came upon Troy as he waited : this was the second time she had broken a serious engagement with him In anger he vowed it should be the last , and at eleven o'clock , when he had lingered and watched the stone of the bridge till he knew every lichen upon their face and heard the chink of the ripples underneath till they oppressed him , he jumped from his seat , went to the inn for his gig , and in a bitter mood of indifference con- cerning the past , and recklessness about the future , drove on to Budmouth races . He reached the race - course at two o'clock , and re- mained either there or in the town till nine , But Fanny 's image , as it had appeared to him in the sombre shadows of that Saturday evening , returned to his mind , backed up by Bathsheba 's reproaches . He vowed he would not bet , and he kept his vow , for on leaving the town at nine o'clock in the evening he had diminish his cash only to the extent of a few shillings . He trotted slowly homeward , and it was now that was struck for the first time with a thought that Fanny had been really prevented by illness from keeping her promise . This time she could have made no mistake He regretted that he had not remained in Casterbridge and made inquiries . Reaching home he quietly un- harnessed the horse and came indoors , as we have seen , to the fearful shock that awaited him . As soon as it grew light enough to distinguish objects , Troy arose from the coverlet of the bed , and in a mood of absolute indifference to Bathsheba 's whereabouts , a almost oblivious of her existence , he stalked downstairs and left the house by the back door . His walk was towards the churchyard , entering which he searched around till he found a newly dug unoccupied grave - the grave dug the day before for Fanny . The position of this having been marked , he hastened on to Caster- bridge , only pausing whereon he had last seen Fanny alive . Reaching the town , Troy descended into a side street and entered a pair of gates surmounted by a board bearing the words , "
129145	129260	129261	129261	he	2724	" Within were lying about stones of all sizes and designs , inscribed as being sacred to the memory of unnamed persons who had not yet died . Troy was so unlike himself now in look , word , and deed , that the want of likeness was perceptible even to his own consciousness . His method of engaging himself in this business of purchasing a tomb was that of an absolutely unpractised man . He could not bring him- self to consider , calculate , or economize . He waywardly wished for something , and he set about obtaining it like a child in a nursery . ' I want a good tomb . "
129276	129293	129261	129261	he	2724	" I want as good a one as you can give me for twenty- seven pounds , "
129302	129309	129261	129261	he	2724	" That sum to include everything ? "
129310	129333	129261	129261	he	2724	" Everything . Cutting the name , carriage to Weather- bury , and erection . And I want it now at once . "
129334	129345	129261	129261	he	2724	" We could not get anything special worked this week . "
129362	129363	129261	129261	he	2724	" "
129367	129373	129261	129261	he	2724	" said Troy , impatiently . "
129381	129382	129449	129449	I	0	" "
129393	129404	131894	131894	He	2729	" said the stone- cutter , going into a shed . "
129453	131893	132460	132460	ma'am	712	" Well , I could add the name , and put it up at visitor who wore not a shred of mourning . Troy then settled the account and went away . In the afternoon almost done . He waited in the yard till the tomb was way to Weatherbury , giving directions to the two men the grave of the person named in the inscription . bridge . He carried rather a heavy basket upon his occasionally at bridges and gates , whereon he deposited returning in the darkness , the men and the waggon the work was done , and , on being assured that it was , Troy entered Weatherbury churchyard about ten had marked the vacant grave early in the morning . It extent from the view of passers along the road - a spot and bushes of alder , but now it was cleared and made the ground elsewhere . Here now stood the tomb as the men had stated , snow- white and shapely in the gloom , consisting of head and foot - stone , and enclosing border of marble - work uniting them . In the midst was mould , suitable for plants . Troy deposited his basket beside the tomb , and vanished for a few minutes . When he returned he carried a spade and a lantern , the light of which he directed for a few moments upon the marble , whilst he read the inscription . He hung his lantern on the lowest bough of the yew - tree , and took from his basket flower- roots of several varieties . There were bundles of snow- drop , hyacinth and crocus bulbs , violets and double daisies , which were to bloom in early spring , and of carnations , pinks , picotees , lilies of the valley , forget - me- not , summer's - farewell , meadow - saffron and others , for the later seasons of the year . Troy laid these out upon the grass , and with an im- passive face set to work to plant them . The snowdrops were arranged in a line on the outside of the coping , the remainder within the enclosure of the grave . The crocuses and hyacinths were to grow in rows ; some of the summer flowers he placed over her head and feet , the lilies and forget - me - nots over her heart . The remainder were dispersed in the spaces between these . Troy , in his prostration at this time , had no percep- tion that in the futility of these romantic doings , dictated by a remorseful reaction from previous indifference , there was any element of absurdity . Deriving his idiosyn- crasies from both sides of the Channel , he showed at such junctures as the present the inelasticity of the Englishman , together with that blindness to the line where sentiment verges on mawkishness , characteristic of the French . lt was a cloudy , muggy , and very dark night , and the rays from Troy 's lantern spread into the two old yews with a strange illuminating power , flickering , as it seemed , up to the black ceiling of cloud above . He felt a large drop of rain upon the back of his hand , and presently one came and entered one of the holes of the lantern , whereupon the candle sputtered and went out- Troy was weary and it being now not far from midnight , and the rain threatening to increase , he resolved to leave the finishing touches of his labour until the day should break . He groped along the wall and over the graves in the dark till he found himself round at the north side . Here he entered the porch , and , reclining upon the bench within , fell asleep . CHAPTER XLVI THE GURGOYLE : ITS DOINGS THE tower of Weatherbury Church was a square erection of fourteenth - century date , having two stone gurgoyles on each of the four faces of its parapet . Of these eight carved protuberances only two at this time continued to serve the purpose of their erection - that of spouting the water from the lead roof within . One mouth in each front had been closed by bygone church- wardens as superfluous , and two others were broken away and choked - a matter not of much consequence to the wellbeing of the tower , for the two mouths which still remained open and active were gaping enough to do all the work . It has been sometimes argued that there is no truer criterion of the vitality of any given art - period than the power of the master - spirits of that time in grotesque ; and certainly in the instance of Gothic art there is no disputing the proposition . Weatherbury tower was a somewhat early instance of the use of an ornamental parapet in parish as distinct from cathedral churches , and the gurgoyles , which are the necessary correlatives of a parapet , were exceptionally prominent - of the boldest cut that the hand could shape , and of the most original design that a human brain could conceive . There was , so to speak , that symmetry in their distortion which is less the characteristic of British than of Continental grotesques of the period . All the eight were different from each other . A beholder was con- vinced that nothing on earth could be more hideous than those he saw on the north side until he went round to the south . Of the two on this latter face , only that at the south - eastern corner concerns the story . It was too human to be called like a dragon , too impish to be like a man , too animal to be like a fiend , and not enough like a bird to be called a griffin . This horrible stone entity was fashioned as if covered with a wrinkled hide ; it had short , erect ears , eyes starting from their sockets , and its fingers and hands were seizing the corners of its mouth , which they thus seemed to pull open to give free passage to the water it vomited . The lower row of teeth was quite washed away , though the upper still remained . Here and thus , jutting a couple of feet from the wall against which its feet rested as a support , the creature had for four hundred years laughed at the surrounding landscape , voicelessly in dry weather , and in wet with a gurgling and snorting sound . Troy slept on in the porch , and the rain increased outside . Presently the gurgoyle spat . In due time a small stream began to trickle through the seventy feet of aerial space between its mouth and the ground , which the water - drops smote like duckshot in their accelerated velocity . The stream thickened in substance , and in- creased in power , gradually spouting further and yet further from the side of the tower . When the rain fell in a steady and ceaseless torrent the stream dashed downward in volumes . We follow its course to the ground at this point of time . The end of the liquid parabola has come forward from the wall , has advanced over the plinth mouldings , over a heap of stones , over the marble border , into the midst of Fanny Robin 's grave . The force of the stream had , until very lately , been received upon some loose stones spread thereabout , which had acted as a shield to the soil under the onset . These during the summer had been cleared from the ground , and there was now nothing to resist the down- fall but the bare earth . For several years the stream had not spouted so far from the tower as it was doing on this night , and such a contingency had been over- looked . Sometimes this obscure corner received no inhabitant for the space of two or three years , and then it was usually but a pauper , a poacher , or other sinner of undignified sins . The persistent torrent from the gurgoyle 's jaws directed all its vengeance into the grave . The rich tawny mould was stirred into motion , and boiled like chocolate . The water accumulated and washed deeper down , and the roar of the pool thus formed spread into the night as the head and chief among other noises of the kind created by the deluging rain . The flowers so carefully planted by Fanny 's repentant lover began to move and writhe in their bed . The winter - violets turned slowly upside down , and became a mere mat of mud . Soon the snowdrop and other bulbs danced in the boiling mass like ingredients in a cauldron . Plants of the tufted species were loosened , rose to the surface , and floated of . Troy did not awake from his comfortless sleep till it was broad day . Not having been in bed for two nights his shoulders felt stiff his feet tender , and his head heavy . He remembered his position , arose , shivered , took the spade , and again went out . The rain had quite ceased , and the sun was shining through the green , brown , and yellow leaves , now sparkling and varnished by the raindrops to the bright- ness of similar effects in the landscapes of Ruysdael and Hobbema , and full of all those infinite beauties that arise from the union of water and colour with high lights . The air was rendered so transparent by the heavy fall of rain that the autumn hues of the middle distance were as rich as those near at hand , and the remote fields intercepted by the angle of the tower ap- peared in the same plane as the tower itself . He entered the gravel path which would take him behind the tower . The path , instead of being stony as it had been the night before , was browned over with a thin coating of mud . At one place in the path he saw a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a bundle of tendons . He picked it up - surely it could not be one of the primroses he had planted ? He saw a bulb , another , and another as he advanced . Beyond doubt they were the crocuses . With a face of perplexed dismay Troy turned the corner and then beheld the wreck the stream had made . The pool upon the grave had soaked away into the ground , and in its place was a hollow . The disturbed earth was washed over the grass and pathway in the guise of the brown mud he had already seen , and it spotted the marble tombstone with the same stains . Nearly all the flowers were washed clean out of the ground , and they lay , roots upwards , on the spots whither they had been splashed by the stream . Troy 's brow became heavily contracted . He set his teeth closely , and his compressed lips moved as those of one in great pain . This singular accident , by a strange confluence of emotions in him , was felt as the sharpest sting of all . Troy 's face was very expressive , and any observer who had seen him now would hardly have believed him to be a man who had laughed , and sung , and poured love - trifles into a woman 's ear . To curse his miserable lot was at first his impulse , but even that lowest stage of rebellion needed an activity whose absence was necessarily antecedent to the existence of the morbid misery which wrung him . The sight , coming as it did , superimposed upon the other dark scenery of the previous days , formed a sort of climax to the whole panorama , and it was more than he could endure . Sanguine by nature , Troy had a power of eluding grief by simply adjourning it . He could put off the consideration of any particular spectre till the matter had become old and softened by time . The planting of flowers on Fanny 's grave had been perhaps but a species of elusion of the primary grief , and now it was as if his intention had been known and circumvented . Almost for the first time in his life , Troy , as he stood by this dismantled grave , wished himself another man . lt is seldom that a person with much animal spirit does not feel that the fact of his life being his own is the one qualification which singles it out as a more hopeful life than that of others who may actually resemble him in every particular . Troy had felt , in his transient way , hundreds of times , that he could not envy other people their condition , because the possession of that condition would have necessitated a different personality , when he desired no other than his own . He had not minded the peculiarities of his birth , the vicissitudes of his life , the meteorlike uncertainty of all that related to him , because these appertained to the hero of his story , without whom there would have been no story at all for him ; and it seemed to be only in the nature of things that matters would right themselves at some proper date and wind up well . This very morning the illusion completed its disappearance , and , as it were , all of a sudden , Troy hated himself . The suddenness was probably more apparent than real . A coral reef which just comes short of the ocean surface is no more to the horizon than if it had never been begun , and the mere finishing stroke is what often appears to create an event which has long been potentially an accomplished thing . He stood and mediated - a miserable man . Whither should he go ? "
131905	132448	132460	132460	ma'am	712	" was the pitiless anathema written in this spoliated effort of his new - born solicitousness . A man who has spent his primal strength in journeying in one direction has not much spirit left for reversing his course . Troy had , since yesterday , faintly reversed his ; but the merest opposition had disheartened him . To turn about would have been hard enough under the greatest providential encouragement ; but to find that Providence , far from helping him into a new course , or showing any wish that he might adopt one , actually jeered his first trembling and critical attempt in that kind , was more than nature could bear . He slowly withdrew from the grave . He did not attempt to fill up the hole , replace the flowers , or do anything at all . He simply threw up his cards and forswore his game for that time and always . Going out of the churchyard silently and unobserved - none of the villagers having yet risen - he passed down some fields at the back , and emerged just as secretly upon the high road . Shortly afterwards he had gone from the village . Meanwhile , Bathsheba remained a voluntary prisoner in the attic . The door was kept locked , except during the entries and exits of Liddy , for whom a bed had been arranged in a small adjoining room . The light of Troy 's lantern in the churchyard was noticed about ten o'clock by the maid - servant , who casually glanced from the window in that direction whilst taking her supper , and she called Bathsheba 's attention to it . They looked curiously at the phenomenon for a time , until Liddy was sent to bed . bathsheba did not sleep very heavily that night . When her attendant was unconscious and softly breath- ing in the next room , the mistress of the house was still looking out of the window at the faint gleam spreading from among the trees - not in a steady shine , but blinking like a revolving coastlight , though this appearance failed to suggest to her that a person was passing and repassing in front of it . Bathsheba sat here till it began to rain , and the light vanished , when she withdrew to lie restlessly in her bed and re - enact in a worn mind the lurid scene of yesternight . Almost before the first faint sign of dawn appeared she arose again , and opened the window to obtain a full breathing of the new morning air , the panes being now wet with trembling tears left by the night rain , each one rounded with a pale lustre caught from primrose- hued slashes through a cloud low down in the awaken- ing sky . From the trees came the sound of steady dripping upon the drifted leaves under them , and from the direction of the church she could hear another noise - peculiar , and not intermittent like the rest , the purl of water falling into a pool . Liddy knocked at eight o'clock , and Bathsheba un- locked the door . "
132462	132475	132484	132484	you	712	" said Liddy , when her inquiries about breakfast had been made . "

138194	138224	138277	138277	Liddy	191	" said the strategic lover , throbbing throughout him at the presumption which Liddy 's words appeared to warrant - that his darling had thought of re - marriage . "
138242	138264	138294	138294	he	224	" Yes , yes , I understand . When she alludes to the possibility of marrying again , you conclude - - "
138265	138275	138294	138294	he	224	" She never do allude to it , sir . "
138288	138293	138227	138227	she	2921	" Of course not . "
138303	138351	138294	138294	he	224	" You need n't take quite such long reaches with your rake , Lydia - short and quick ones are best . Well , perhaps , as she is absolute mistress again now , it is wise of her to resolve never to give up her freedom . "
138352	138395	138443	138443	Liddy	191	" My mistress did certainly once say , though not seriously , that she supposed she might marry again at the end of seven years from last year , if she cared to risk Mr. Troy 's coming back and claiming her . "
138396	138432	138452	138452	Boldwood	224	" Ah , six years from the present time . Said that she might . She might marry at once in every reasonable person 's opinion , whatever the lawyers may say to the contrary . "
138433	138441	138452	138452	Boldwood	224	" Have you been to ask them ? "
138447	138450	138452	138452	Boldwood	224	" Not I. "
138457	138488	139808	139809	Black Bess	383	" Liddy , you need n't stay here a minute later than you wish , so Mr , Oak says . I am now going on a little farther . Good "
138491	139793	139808	139809	Black Bess	383	" He went away vexed with himself , and ashamed of having for this one time in his life done anything which could be called underhand . Poor Boldwood had no more skill in finesse than a battering - ram , and he was uneasy with a sense of having made himself to appear stupid and , what was worse , mean . But he had , after all , lighted upon one fact by way of repayment . It was a singularly fresh and fascinating fact , and though not without its sadness it was pertinent and real . In little more than six years from this time Bathsheba might certainly marry him . There was something definite in that hope , for admitting that there might have been no deep thought in her words to Liddy about marriage , they showed at least her creed on the matter . This pleasant notion was now continually in his mind . Six years were a long time , but how much shorter than never , the idea he had for so long been obliged to endure ! Jacob had served twice seven years for Rachel : what were six for such a woman as this ? He tried to like the notion of waiting for her better than that of winning her at once . Boldwood felt his love to be so deep and strong and eternal , that it was pos- sible she had never yet known its full volume , and this patience in delay would afford him an opportunity of giving sweet proof on the point . He would annihilate the six years of his life as if they were minutes - so little did he value his time on earth beside her love . He would let her see , all those six years of intangible ether- eal courtship , how little care he had for anything but as it bore upon the consummation . Meanwhile the early and the late summer brought round the week in which Greenhill Fair was held . This fair was frequently attended by the folk of Weather- bury . CHAPTER L THE SHEEP FAIR - TROY TOUCHES HIS WIFE 'S HAND GREENHILL was the Nijni Novgorod of South Wessex ; and the busiest , merriest , noisiest day of the whole statute number was the day of the sheep fair . This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a hill which retained in good preservation the remains of an ancient earthwork , consisting of a huge rampart and entrenchment of an oval form encircling the top of the hill , though somewhat broken down here and there . To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a winding road ascended , and the level green space of ten or fifteen acres enclosed by the bank was the site of the fair . A few permanent erections dotted the spot , but the majority of visitors patronized canvas alone for resting and feeding under during the time of their sojourn here . Shepherds who attended with their flocks from long distances started from home two or three days , or even a week , before the fair , driving their charges a few miles each day - not more than ten or twelve - and resting them at night in hired fields by the wayside at pre- viously chosen points , where they fed , having fasted since morning . The shepherd of each flock marched behind , a bundle containing his kit for the week strapped upon his shoulders , and in his hand his crook , which he used as the staff of his pilgrimage . Several of the sheep would get worn and lame , and occasionally a lambing occurred on the road . To meet these contingencies , there was frequently provided , to accompany the flocks from the remoter points , a pony and waggon into which the weakly ones were taken for the remainder of the journey . The Weatherbury Farms , however , were no such long distance from the hill , and those arrangements were not necessary in their case . But the large united flocks of Bathsheba and Farmer Boldwood formed a valuable and imposing multitude which demanded much attention , and on this account Gabriel , in addition to Boldwood 's shepherd and Cain Ball , accompanied them along the way , through the decayed old town of Kings- bere , and upward to the plateau , - old George the dog of course behind them . When the autumn sun slanted over Greenhill this morning and lighted the dewy flat upon its crest , nebu- lous clouds of dust were to be seen floating between the pairs of hedges which streaked the wide prospect around in all directions . These gradually converged upon the base of the hill , and the flocks became individually visible , climbing the serpentine ways which led to the top . Thus , in a slow procession , they entered the opening to which the roads tended , multitude after multitude , horned and hornless - blue flocks and red flocks , buff flocks and brown flocks , even green and salmon - tinted flocks , according to the fancy of the colourist and custom of the farm . Men were shouting , dogs were barking , with greatest animation , but the thronging travellers in so long a journey had grown nearly indifferent to such terrors , though they still bleated piteously at the unwontedness of their experi- ences , a tall shepherd rising here and there in the midst of them , like a gigantic idol amid a crowd of prostrate devotees . The great mass of sheep in the fair consisted of South Downs and the old Wessex horned breeds , to the latter class Bathsheba 's and Farmer Boldwood 's mainly belonged . These filed in about nine o'clock , their vermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side of their cheeks in geometrically perfect spirals , a small pink and white ear nestling under each horn . Before and behind came other varieties , perfect leopards as to the full rich substance of their coats , and only lacking the spots . There were also a few of the Oxfordshire breed , whose wool was beginning to curl like a child 's flaxen hair , though surpassed in this respect by the effeminate Leicesters , which were in turn less curly than the Cots- wolds . But the most picturesque by far was a small flock of Exmoors , which chanced to be there this year . Their pied faces and legs , dark and heavy horns , tresses of wool hanging round their swarthy foreheads , quite relieved the monotony of the flocks in that quarter . All these bleating , panting , and weary thousands had entered and were penned before the morning had far advanced , the dog belonging to each flock being tied to the corner of the pen containing it . Alleys for pedes- trians intersected the pens , which soon became crowded with buyers and sellers from far and near . In another part of the hill an altogether different scene began to force itself upon the eye towards mid- day . A circular tent , of exceptional newness and size , was in course of erection here . As the day drew on , the flocks began to change hands , lightening the shep- herd 's responsibilities ; and they turned their attention to this tent and inquired of a man at work there , whose soul seemed concentrated on tying a bothering knot in no time , what was going on . "
139811	139931	139965	139965	I	0	" replied the man promptly , without turning his eyes or leaving off trying . As soon as the tent was completed the band struck up highly stimulating harmonies , and the announce- ment was publicly made , Black Bess standing in a con- spicuous position on the outside , as a living proof , If proof were wanted , of the truth of the oracular utterances from the stage over which the people were to enter . These were so convinced by such genuine appeals to heart and understanding both that they soon began to crowd in abundantly , among the foremost being visible Jan Coggan and Joseph Poorgrass , who were holiday keeping here to - day , "
139941	139962	140054	140054	she	2933	" screamed a woman in front of Jan over her shoulder at him when the rush was at its fiercest . "
139976	140043	140117	140119	the damn women	2937	" said Coggan , in a deprecating tone , turning without turning his body , which was jammed as in a vice . There was a silence ; then the drums and trumpets again sent forth their echoing notes . The crowd was again ecstasied , and gave another lurch in which Coggan and Poorgrass were again thrust by those behind upon the women in front . "
140066	140090	140148	140148	They	2937	" said Coggan , appealing in an earnest voice to the public at large as it stood clustered about his shoulder - blades . "
140127	140128	140167	140167	they	2937	" "
140138	140147	141214	141215	Mrs. Troy	353	" implored Joseph Poorgrass , in a whisper . "
140175	141202	141214	141215	Mrs. Troy	353	" Jan held his tongue , as if he had no objection to be pacified to please a friend , and they gradually reached the foot of the ladder , Poorgrass being flattened like a jumping - jack , and the sixpence , for admission , which he had got ready half - an - hour earlier , having become so reeking hot in the tight squeeze of his excited hand that the woman in spangles , brazen rings set with glass diamonds , and with chalked face and shoulders , who took the money of him , hastily dropped it again from a fear that some trick had been played to burn her fingers . So they all entered , and the cloth of the tent , to the eyes of an observer on the outside , became bulged into innumerable pimples such as we observe on a sack of potatoes , caused by the various human heads , backs , and elbows at high pressure within . At the rear of the large tent there were two small dressing - tents . One of these , alloted to the male per- formers , was partitioned into halves by a cloth ; and in one of the divisions there was sitting on the grass , pull ing on a pair of jack - boots , a young man whom we instantly recognise as Sergeant Troy . Troy 's appearance in this position may be briefly accounted for . The brig aboard which he was taken in Budmouth Roads was about to start on a voyage , though somewhat short of hands . Troy read the articles and joined , but before they sailed a boat was despatched across the bay to Lulwind cove ; as he had half expected , his clothes were gone . He ultimately worked his passage to the United States , where he made a precarious living in various towns as Professor of Gymnastics , Sword Exercise , Fencing , and Pugilism . A few months were sufficient to give him a distaste for this kind of life . There was a certain animal form of refinement in his nature ; and however pleasant a strange condition might be whilst privations were easily warded off , it was dis- advantageously coarse when money was short . There was ever present , too , the idea that he could claim a home and its comforts did he but chose to return to England and Weatherbury Farm . Whether Bathsheba thought him dead was a frequent subject of curious conjecture . To England he did return at last ; but the but the fact of drawing nearer to Weatherbury abstracted its fascinations , and his intention to enter his old groove at the place became modified . It was with gloom he con- sidered on landing at Liverpool that if he were to go home his reception would be of a kind very unpleasant to con- template ; for what Troy had in the way of emotion was an occasional fitful sentiment which sometimes caused him as much inconvenience as emotion of a strong and healthy kind . Bathsheba was not a women to be made a fool of , or a woman to suffer in silence ; and how could he endure existence with a spirited wife to whom at first entering he would be beholden for food and lodging ? Moreover , it was not at all unlikely that his wife would fail at her farming , if she had not already done so ; and he would then become liable for her maintenance : and what a life such a future of poverty with her would be , the spectre of Fanny constantly be- tween them , harrowing his temper and embittering her words ! Thus , for reasons touching on distaste , regret , and shame commingled , he put off his return from day to day , and would have decided to put it off altogether if he could have found anywhere else the ready - made establishment which existed for him there . At this time - the July preceding the September in which we find at Greenhill Fair - he fell in with a travelling circus which was performing in the outskirts of a northern town . Troy introduced himself to the manager by taming a restive horse of the troupe , hitting a suspended apple with pistol - bullet fired from the animal 's back when in full gallop , and other feats . For his merits in these - all more or less based upon his ex- periences as a dragoon - guardsman - Troy was taken into the company , and the play of Turpin was prepared with a view to his personation of the chief character . Troy was not greatly elated by the appreciative spirit in which he was undoubtedly treated , but he thought the engage- ment might afford him a few weeks for consideration . It was thus carelessly , and without having formed any definite plan for the future , that Troy found himself at Greenhill Fair with the rest of the company on this day . And now the mild autumn sun got lower , and in front of the pavilion the following incident had taken place . Bathsheba - who was driven to the fair that day by her odd man Poorgrass - had , like every one else , read or heard the announcement that Mr. Francis , the Great Cosmopolitan Equestrian and Roughrider , would enact the part of Turpin , and she was not yet too old and careworn to be without a little curiosity to see him . This particular show was by far the largest and grandest in the fair , a horde of little shows grouping themselves under its shade like chickens around a hen . The crowd had passed in , and Boldwood , who had been watching all the day for an opportunity of speaking to her , seeing her comparatively isolated , came up to her side . "
141217	141223	141262	141262	we	2942	" he said , nervously . "
141230	141244	141274	141274	you	0	" said Bathsheba , colour springing up in the centre of her cheeks . "
141270	141271	141306	141306	He	2944	" "
141280	141281	141339	141339	he	384	" "
141324	141331	141382	141382	Coggan	180	" Turpin 's Ride to York ? "
141342	141343	141400	141400	they	2952	" "
141380	141381	141422	141422	You	2953	" "
141406	141407	141458	141458	they	2955	" "
141432	141433	141505	141505	I	0	" "
141461	141462	141534	141534	I	0	" "
141515	141524	141626	141626	I	0	" Perceiving that she hesitated , he added , "
141540	141607	142341	142341	Satan	337	" Now Bathsheba did care a little to see the show , and had only withheld her feet from the ladder because she feared to go in alone . She had been hoping that Oak might appear , whose assistance in such cases was always accepted as an inalienable right , but Oak was nowhere to be seen ; and hence it was that she said , "
141636	141661	142341	142341	Satan	337	" And so a short time after this Bathsheba appeared in the tent with Boldwood at her elbow , who , taking her to a "
141663	142295	142341	142341	Satan	337	" seat , again withdrew . This feature consisted of one raised bench in very conspicuous part of the circle , covered with red cloth , and floored with a piece of carpet , and Bathsheba immediately found , to her confusion , that she was the single reserved individual in the tent , the rest of the crowded spectators , one and all , standing on their legs on the borders of the arena , where they got twice as good a view of the performance for half the money . Hence as many eyes were turned upon her , enthroned alone in this place of honour , against a scarlet back- ground , as upon the ponies and clown who were engaged in preliminary exploits in the centre , Turpin not having yet appeared . Once there , Bathsheba was forced to make the best of it and remain : she sat down , spreading her skirts with some dignity over the unoccupied space on each side of her , and giving a new and feminine aspect to the pavilion . In a few minutes she noticed the fat red nape of Coggan 's neck among those standing just below her , and Joseph Poor- grass 's saintly profile a little further on . The interior was shadowy with a peculiar shade . The strange luminous semi - opacities of fine autumn afternoons and eves intensified into Rembrandt effects the few yellow sunbeams which came through holes and divisions in the canvas , and spirted like jets of gold - dust across the dusky blue atmosphere of haze pervading the tent , until they alighted on inner surfaces of cloth opposite , and shone like little lamps suspended there . Troy , on peeping from his dressing - tent through a slit for a reconnoitre before entering , saw his unconscious wife on high before him as described , sitting as queen of the tournament . He started back in utter confusion , for although his disguise effectually concealed his person- ality , he instantly felt that she would be sure to recognize his voice . He had several times during the day thought of the possibility of some Weatherbury person or other appearing and recognizing him ; but he had taken the risk carelessly . If they see me , let them , he had said . But here was Bathsheba in her own person ; and the reality of the scene was so much intenser than any of his prefigurings that he felt he had not half enough considered the point . She looked so charming and fair that his cool mood about Weatherbury people was changed . He had not expected her to exercise this power over him in the twinkling of an eye . Should he go on , and care nothing ? He could not bring himself to do that . Beyond a politic wish to remain unknown , there suddenly arose in him now a sense of shame at the possibility that his attractive young wife , who already despised him , should despise him more by discovering him in so mean a condition after so long a time . He actually blushed at the thought , and was vexed beyond measure that his sentiments of dislike towards Weatherbury should have led him to dally about the country in this way . But Troy was never more clever than when absolutely at his wit 's end . He hastily thrust aside the curtain dividing his own little dressing space from that of the manager and proprietor , who now appeared as the individual called Tom King as far down as his waist , and as the aforesaid respectable manager thence to his toes . "
142303	142307	142318	142320	a blackguard creditor	2956	" said Troy . "
142312	142313	142341	142341	Satan	337	" "
142354	142363	142379	142379	you	0	" You must appear now , I think . "
142364	142369	142399	142399	he	384	" I ca n't . "
142376	142377	142432	142432	Troy	243	" "
142409	142416	142432	142432	Troy	243	" The proprietor shook his head . "
142436	142453	142619	142619	Coggan	180	" Very well , then let me see . I tell you how we 'll manage . "
142476	142533	142710	142710	his	2958	" I wo n't tell 'em anything about your keeping silence ; go on with the piece and say nothing , doing what you can by a judicious wink now and then , and a few indomitable nods in the heroic places , you know . They 'll never find out that the speeches are omitted . "
142625	142629	142774	142774	he	196	" Well done ! "
142713	142727	143931	143931	Turpin	384	" Of course he 's not really shot , Jan - only seemingly ! "
142781	142804	143931	143931	Turpin	384	" Twill be something to tell of at Warren 's in future years , Jan , and hand down to our children . "
142864	142924	143931	143931	Turpin	384	" memories , then did Black Bess become immortal that day if she never had done so before . Meanwhile Troy had added a few touches to his ordinary make - up for the character , the more effectually to disguise himself , and though he had felt faint qualms on first entering , the metamorphosis effected by judici- ously "
142926	143930	143982	143982	Bathsheba	243	" his face with a wire rendered him safe from the eyes of Bathsheba and her men . Nevertheless , he was relieved when it was got through . There a second performance in the evening , and the tent was lighted up . Troy had taken his part very quietly this time , venturing to introduce a few speeches on occasion ; and was just concluding it when , whilst standing at the edge of the circle contiguous to the first row of spectators , he observed within a yard of him the eye of a man darted keenly into his side features . Troy hastily shifted his position , after having recognized in sworn enemy , who still hung about the outskirts of At first Troy resolved to take no notice and abide by circumstances . That he had been recognized by this man was highly probable ; yet there was room for a doubt . Then the great objection he had felt to allowing news of his proximity to precede him to Weatherbury in the event of his return , based on a feeling that knowledge of his present occupation would discredit him still further in his wife 's eyes , returned in full force . Moreover , should he resolve not to return at all , a tale of his being alive and being in the neighbourhood would be awkward ; and he was anxious to acquire a knowledge of his wife 's temporal affairs before deciding which to do . In this dilemma Troy at once went out to recon- noitre . It occurred to him that to find Pennyways , and make a friend of him if possible , would be a very wise act . He had put on a thick beard borrowed from the establishment , and this he wandered about the fair- field . It was now almost dark , and respectable people were getting their carts and gigs ready to go home The largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided by an innkeeper from a neighbouring town . This was considered an unexceptionable place for obtaining the necessary food and rest : Host Trencher as he was jauntily called by the local newspaper being a sub- stantial man of high repute for catering through all the county round . The tent was divided into first and second - class compartments , and at the end of the first- class division was a yet further enclosure for the most exclusive , fenced of from the body of the tent by a luncheon - bar , behind which the host himself stood bustling about in white apron and shirt - sleeves , and look- ing as if he had never lived anywhere but under canvas all his life . In these penetralia were chairs and a table , which , on candles being lighted , made quite a cozy and luxurious show , with an urn , plated tea and coffee pots , china teacups , and plum cakes . Troy stood at the entrance to the booth , where a gipsy - woman was frying pancakes over a little fire of sticks and selling them at a penny a - piece , and looked over the heads of the people within . He could see nothing of Pennyways , but he soon discerned Bathsheba through an opening into the reserved space at the further end . Troy thereupon retreated , went round the tent into the darkness , and listened . He could hear Bathsheba 's voice immediately inside the canvas ; she was conversing with a man . A warmth overspread his face : surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in a fair ! He wondered if , then , she reckoned upon his death as an absolute certainty . To get at the root of the matter , Troy took a penknife from his pocket and softly made two little cuts crosswise in the cloth , which , by folding back the corners left a hole the size of a wafer . Close to this he placed his face , withdrawing it again in a movement of surprise ; for his eye had been within twelve inches of the top of Bathsheba 's head . lt was too near to be convenient . He made another hole a little to one side and lower down , in a shaded place beside her chair , from which it was easy and safe to survey her by looking horizontally ' . Troy took in the scene completely now . She was leaning back , sipping a cup of tea that she held in her hand , and the owner of the male voice was Boldwood , who had apparently just brought the cup to her , Bathsheba , being in a negligent mood , leant so idly against the canvas that it was pressed to the shape of her shoulder , and she was , in fact , as good as in Troy 's arms ; and he was obliged to keep his breast carefully backward that she might not feel its warmth through the cloth as he gazed in . Troy found unexpected chords of feeling to be stirred again within him as they had been stirred earlier in the day . She was handsome as ever , and she was his . It was some minutes before he could counteract his sudden wish to go in , and claim her . Then he thought how the proud girl who had always looked down upon him even whilst it was to love him , would hate him on dis- covering him to be a strolling player . Were he to make himself known , that chapter of his life must at all risks be kept for ever from her and from the Weatherbury people , or his name would be a byword throughout the parish . He would be nicknamed "
143932	143958	143982	143982	Bathsheba	243	" as long as he lived . Assuredly before he could claim her these few past months of his existence must be entirely blotted out . "
143971	143980	144180	144180	Pennyways	251	" said Farmer Boldwood . I thank you , "
143984	144060	144180	144180	Pennyways	251	" But I must be going at once . It was great neglect in that man to keep me waiting here till so late . I should have gone two hours ago , if it had not been for him . I had no idea of coming in here ; but there 's nothing so refreshing as a cup of tea , though I should never have got one if you had n't helped me . "
144172	144178	144180	144180	Pennyways	251	" Excuse me , ma'am . "
144182	144193	144180	144180	Pennyways	251	" I 've some private information for your ear alone . "
144201	144246	144299	144300	the fool	2977	" she said , coldly . That Bathsheba could not endure this man was evident ; in fact , he was continually coming to her with some tale or other , by which he might creep into favour at the expense of persons maligned . "
144253	144286	144299	144300	the fool	2977	" said Pennyways , confidently . He stooped over the table , pulled a leaf from a warped pocket - book , and wrote upon the paper , in a round hand - "
144303	144408	144457	144457	I	0	" This he folded small , and handed towards her . Bathsheba would not read it ; she would not even put out her hand to take it . Pennyways , then , with a laugh of derision , tossed it into her lap , and , turning away , left her . From the words and action of Pennyways , Troy , though he had not been able to see what the ex - bailiff wrote , had not a moment 's doubt that the note referred to him . Nothing that he could think of could be done to check the exposure . "
144413	144442	144457	144457	I	0	" he whispered , and added imprecations which rustled in the gloom like a pestilent wind . Meanwhile Boldwood said , taking up the note from her lap - "
144462	144463	144518	144518	He	2979	" "
144468	144474	145644	145645	Mrs. Troy	353	" said Bathsheba , carelessly , "
144524	144979	145644	145645	Mrs. Troy	353	" Bathsheba held the note in her right hand . Bold- wood handed towards her a plate of cut bread - and- butter ; when , in order to take a slice , she put the note into her left hand , where she was still holding the purse , and then allowed her hand to drop beside her close to the canvas . The moment had come for saving his game , and Troy impulsively felt that he would play the card , For yet another time he looked at the fair hand , and saw the pink finger - tips , and the blue veins of the wrist , encircled by a bracelet of coral chippings which she wore : how familiar it all was to him ! Then , with the lightning action in which he was such an adept , he noiselessly slipped his hand under the bottom of the tent - cloth , which was far from being pinned tightly down , lifted it a little way , keeping his eye to the hole , snatched the note from her fingers , dropped the canvas , and ran away in the gloom towards the bank and ditch , smiling at the scream of astonishment which burst from her . Troy then slid down on the outside of the rampart , hastened round in the bottom of the entrenchment to a distance of a hundred yards , ascended again , and crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front entrance of the tent . His object was now to get to Pennyways , and prevent a repetition of the announcement until such time as he should choose . Troy reached the tent door , and standing among the groups there gathered , looked anxiously for Pennyways , evidently not wishing to make himself prominent by inquiring for him . One or two men were speaking of a daring attempt that had just been made to rob a young lady by lifting the canvas of the tent beside her . It was supposed that the rogue had imagined a slip of paper which she held in her hand to he a bank note , for he had seized it , and made off with it , leaving her purse behind . His chagrin and disappointment at dis- covering its worthlessness would be a good joke , it was said . However , the occurrence seemed to have become known to few , for it had not interrupted a fiddler , who had lately begun playing by the door of the tent , nor the four bowed old men with grim countenances and walking - sticks in hand , who were dancing "
144984	145643	145644	145645	Mrs. Troy	353	" to the tune . Behind these stood Pennyways . Troy glided up to him , beckoned , and whispered a few words ; and with a mutual glance of concurrence the two men went into the night together . CHAPTER LI BATHSHEBA TALKS WITH HER OUTRIDER THE arrangement for getting back again to Weather- bury had been that Oak should take the place of Poor- grass in Bathsheba 's conveyance and drive her home , it being discovered late in the afternoon that Joseph was suffering from his old complaint , a multiplying eye , and was , therefore , hardly trustworthy as coachman and protector to a woman . But Oak had found himself so occupied , and was full of so many cares relative to those portions of Boldwood 's flocks that were not disposed of , that Bathsheba , without telling Oak or anybody , resolved to drive home herself , as she had many times done from Casterbridge Market , and trust to her good angel for performing the journey un- molested . But having fallen in with Farmer Boldwood accidentally on her part at least at the refreshment- tent , she found it impossible to refuse his offer to ride on horseback beside her as escort . It had grown twilight before she was aware , but Boldwood assured her that there was no cause for uneasiness , as the moon would be up in half - an - hour . Immediately after the incident in the tent , she had risen to go - now absolutely alarmed and really grateful for her old lover 's protection - though regretting Gabriel 's absence , whose company she would have much preferred , as being more proper as well as more pleasant , since he was her own managing - man and servant . This , how- ever , could not be helped ; she would not , on any consideration , treat Boldwood harshly , having once already illused him , and the moon having risen , and the gig being ready , she drove across the hilltop in the wending way 's which led downwards - to oblivious obscurity , as it seemed , for the moon and the hill it flooded with light were in appearance on a level , the rest of the world lying as a vast shady concave between them . Boldwood mounted his horse , and followed in close attendance behind . Thus they descended into the lowlands , and the sounds of those left on the hill came like voices from the sky , and the lights were as those of a camp in heaven . They soon passed the merry stragglers in the immediate vicinity of the hill , traversed Kingsbere , and got upon the high road . The keen instincts of Bathsheba had perceived that the farmer 's staunch devotion to herself was still un- diminished , and she sympathized deeply . The sight had quite depressed her this evening ; had reminded her of her folly ; she wished anew , as she had wished many months ago , for some means of making repara- tion for her fault . Hence her pity for the man who so persistently loved on to his own injury and per- manent gloom had betrayed Bathsheba into an injudi- cious considerateness of manner , which appeared almost like tenderness , and gave new vigour to the exquisite dream of a Jacob 's seven years service in poor Boldwood 's mind . He soon found an excuse for advancing from his position in the rear , and rode close by her side . They had gone two or three miles in the moonlight , speaking desultorily across the wheel of her gig concerning the fair , farming , Oak 's usefulness to them both , and other indifferent subjects , when Boldwood said suddenly and simply - "
145654	145678	145711	145711	You	353	" This point - blank query unmistakably confused her , it was not till a minute or more had elapsed that she said , "
145689	145690	145711	145711	You	353	" "
145709	145710	145807	145807	she	0	" "
145738	145752	145807	145807	she	0	" she said , catching at the straw of escape that the fact afforded "
145793	145806	145914	145914	Boldwood	231	" O yes I have , or I should have acted differently , "
145812	145879	145961	145961	she	2988	" From the first , I have had a strange uaccountable feeling that he could not have perished , but I have been able to explain that in several ways since . Even were I half persuaded that I shall see him no more , I am far from thinking of marriage with another . I should be very contemptible to indulge in such a thought . "
145919	145950	145961	145961	she	2988	" Do you remember when I carried you fainting in my arms into the King 's Arms , in Casterbridge ? Every dog has his day : that was mine . "
145951	145960	145999	145999	she	2988	" I know - I know it all . "
145966	145988	145999	145999	she	2988	" I , for one , shall never cease regretting that events so fell out as to deny you to me . "
145989	145998	145961	145961	she	2988	" I , too , am very sorry . "
146007	146021	146098	146098	you	2988	" I mean , you know , I am sorry you thought I - "
146022	146071	146098	146098	you	2988	" I have always this dreary pleasure in thinking over those past times with you - that I was something to you before HE was anything , and that you belonged ALMOST to me . But , of course , that 's nothing . You never liked me . "
146072	146082	146098	146098	you	2988	" I did ; and respected you , too . "Do

It was a simple physical fear - the weak of the strong ; there no emotional aversion or inner repugnance . She said , with some distress in her voice , for she remembered vividly his outburst on the Yalbury Road , and shrank from a repetition of his anger : - "

147121	147288	147289	147289	He	3012	" Bathsheba was in a very peculiar state of mind , which showed how entirely the soul is the slave of the body , the ethereal spirit dependent for its quality upon the tangible flesh and blood . It is hardly too much to say that she felt coerced by a force stronger than her own will , not only into the act of promising upon this singularly remote and vague matter , but into the emo- tion of fancying that she ought to promise . When the weeks intervening between the night of this conversa- tion and Christmas day began perceptibly to diminish , her anxiety and perplexity increased . One day she was led by an accident into an oddly confidential dialogue with Gabriel about her difficulty It afforded her a little relief - of a dull and cheerless kind . They were auditing accounts , and something occurred in the course of their labours which led Oak to say , speaking of Boldwood , "
147299	147338	147415	147415	ye	0	" Then out came her trouble before she was aware ; and she told him how she had again got into the toils ; what Boldwood had asked her , and how he was ex- pecting her assent . "

148440	148517	149105	149105	Liddy	191	" went away . She had spoken frankly , and neither asked nor ex- pected any reply from Gabriel more satisfactory than that she had obtained . Yet in the centremost parts of her complicated heart there existed at this minute a little pang of disappointment , for a reason she would not allow herself to recognize . Oak had not once wished her free that he might marry her himself - had not once said , "
148528	148637	149105	149105	Liddy	191	" That was the insect sting . Not that she would have listened to any such hypothesis . O no - for was n't she saying all the time that such thoughts of the future were improper , and was n't Gabriel far too poor a man to speak sentiment to her ? Yet he might have just hinted about that old love of his , and asked , in a playful off - hand way , if he might speak of it . It would have seemed pretty and sweet , if no more ; and then she would have shown how kind and inoffensive a woman 's "
148639	149099	149169	149169	I	0	" can sometimes be . But to give such cool advice - the very advice she had asked for - it ruffled our heroine all the afternoon . CHAPTER LII CONVERGING COURSES I CHRISTMAS - EVE came , and a party that Boldwood was to give in the evening was the great subject of talk in Weatherbury . It was not that the rarity of Christmas parties in the parish made this one a wonder , but that Boldwood should be the giver . The announcement had had an abnormal and incongruous sound , as if one should hear of croquet - playing in a cathedral aisle , or that some much - respected judge was going upon the stage . That the party was intended to be a truly jovial one there was no room for doubt . A large bough of mistletoe had been brought from the woods that day , and suspended in the hall of the bachelor 's home . Holly and ivy had followed in armfuls . From six that morning till past noon the huge wood fire in the kitchen roared and sparkled at its highest , the kettle , the saucepan , and the threelegged pot appearing in the midst of the flames like Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego ; moreover , roasting and basting operations were continually carried on in front of the genial blaze . As it grew later the fire was made up in the large long hall into which the staircase descended , and all encumbrances were cleared out for dancing . The log which was to form the back - brand of the evening fire was the uncleft trunk of a tree , so unwieldy that it could be neither brought nor rolled to its place ; and accord- ingly two men were to be observed dragging and heaving it in by chains and levers as the hour of assembly drew near . II In spite of all this , the spirit of revelry was wanting In the atmosphere of the house . Such a thing had never been attempted before by its owner , and it was now done as by a wrench . Intended gaieties would insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs , the organ- ization of the whole effort was carried out coldly , by hirelings , and a shadow seemed to move about the rooms , saying that the proceedings were unnatural to the place and the lone man who lived therein , and hence not good . Bathsheba was at this time in her room , dressing for the event . She had called for candles , and Liddy entered and placed one on each side of her mistress 's glass . "
149107	149114	149185	149185	I	0	" said Bathsheba , almost timidly . "
149182	149183	149185	149185	I	0	" "
149190	149209	149245	149245	Liddy	191	" said Liddy , who was going with her ; for Boldwood had been indiscriminate in his invitations . "
149221	149225	149260	149260	ma'am	712	" said Bathsheba . "

A tailor from Casterbridge was with him , assisting him in the operation of trying on a new coat that had just been brought home . Never had Boldwood been so fastidious , unreasonable about the fit , and generally difficult to please . The tailor walked round and round him , tugged at the waist , pulled the sleeve , pressed out the collar , and for the first time in his experience Boldwood was not bored- Times had been when the farmer had exclaimed against all such niceties as childish , but now no philosophic or hasty rebuke whatever was provoked by this man for attaching as much importance to a crease in the coat as to an earthquake in South America . Boldwood at last expressed himself nearly satisfied , and paid the bill , the tailor passing out of the door just as Oak came in to report progress for the day . "

150075	150156	150214	150214	he	3056	" Oak , do n't talk like that . You have got quite cynical lately - how is it ? We seem to have shifted our positions : I have become the young and hopeful man , and you the old and unbelieving one . However , does a woman keep a promise , not to marry , but to enter on an engagement to marry at some time ? Now you know women better than I - tell me . "
150157	150190	150214	150214	he	3056	" I am afeard you honour my understanding too much . However , she may keep such a promise , if it is made with an honest meaning to repair a wrong . "
150191	150213	150355	150355	Oak	144	" It has not gone far yet , but I think it will soon - yes , I know it will . "
150222	150348	150369	150369	he	144	" I have pressed her upon the subject , and she inclines to be kind to me , and to think of me as a husband at a long future time , and that 's enough for me . How can I expect more ? She has a notion that a woman should not marry within seven years of her husband 's disappearance - that her own self should n't , I mean - because his body was not found . It may be merely this legal reason which influences her , or it may be a religious one , but she is reluctant to talk on the point- Yet she has promised - implied - that she will ratify an engagement to - night .

150349	150353	150468	150468	She	3058	" Seven years . "

152214	152489	152523	152524	Mrs. Troy	353	" Oak then left him . He was uneasy on Boldwood 's account , for he saw anew that this constant passion of the farmer made him not the man he once had been . As Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone - ready and dressed to receive his company - the mood of anxiety about his appearance seemed to pass away , and to be succeeded by a deep solemnity . He looked out of the window , and regarded the dim outline of the trees upon the sky , and the twilight deepening to darkness . Then he went to a locked closet , and took from a locked drawer therein a small circular case the size of a pillbox , and was about to put it into his pocket . But he lingered to open the cover and take a momentary glance inside . It contained a woman 's finger - ring , set all the way round with small diamonds , and from its appearance had evidently been recently purchased . Boldwood 's eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long time , though that its material aspect concerned him little was plain from his manner and mien , which were those of a mind following out the presumed thread of that jewel 's future history . The noise of wheels at the front of the house became audible . Boldwood closed the box , stowed it away carefully in his pocket , and went out upon the landing . The old man who was his indoor factotum came at the same moment to the foot of the stairs . "

152538	152596	152616	152616	I	0	" A reserved and sombre expression had returned to Boldwood 's face again , but it poorly cloaked his feel- ings when he pronounced Bathsheba 's name ; and his feverish anxiety continued to show its existence by a galloping motion of his fingers upon the side of his thigh as he went down the stairs .

Pennyways snuffed the candle , and then looked up and deliberately inspected Troy "

153235	153291	153358	153358	Troy	243	" Pennyways now felt himself to be in something of a difficulty , for should Bathsheba and Troy become recon- ciled it would be necessary to regain her good opinion if he would secure the patronage of her husband . I sometimes think she likes you yet , and is a good woman at bottom . "
153300	153344	153473	153473	He	3132	" But there 's no telling to a certainty from a body 's outside . Well , you 'll do as you like about going , of course , sergeant , and as for me , I 'll do as you tell me . "
153345	153356	153482	153483	the boy	444	" Now , let me see what the time is . "

"
153486	153495	153503	153503	His	3132	" one of them remarked in a whisper . "

154164	154228	154354	154354	He	224	" They stood silent then , every man busied with his own thoughts , during which interval sounds of merri- ment could be heard within . Then the front door again opened , the rays streamed out , the wellknown form of Boldwood was seen in the rectangular area of light , the door closed , and Boldwood walked slowly down the path . "
154233	154245	154483	154486	one of the men	2452	" one of the men whispered , as he neared them . "
154316	154353	154483	154486	one of the men	2452	" I hope to God she 'll come , or this night will be nothing but misery to me ! O my darling , my darling , why do you keep me in suspense like this ? "

154488	154500	154541	154541	I	0	" I thought that fancy of his was over long ago . "
154514	154518	154543	154543	we	3171	" said Samway . "
154535	154540	154731	154731	Hist	3179	" remarked a third . "
154552	154558	154731	154731	Hist	3179	" the first uneasily continued . "
154646	154730	154731	154731	Hist	3179	" Samway , Tall , and Smallbury agreed to go to Warren 's , and went out at the gate , the remaining ones entering the house . The three soon drew near the malt - house , approaching it from the adjoining orchard , and not by way of the street . The pane of glass was illuminated as usual . Smallbury was a little in advance of the rest when , pausing , he turned suddenly to his companions and said , "
154736	154771	154875	154875	he	3181	" The light from the pane was now perceived to be shining not upon the ivied wall as usual , but upon some object close to the glass . It was a human face . "
154777	154852	154875	154875	he	3181	" whispered Samway ; and they approached on tiptoe . There was no disbelieving the report any longer . Troy 's face was almost close to the pane , and he was looking in . Not only was he looking in , but he appeared to have been arrested by a conversation which was in progress in the malt - house , the voices of the interlocutors being those of Oak and the maltster . "
154867	154873	154875	154875	he	3181	" said the old man . "
154887	154888	154938	154938	she	3180	" "

154946	154998	155006	155006	his	3181	" The men , after recognizing Troy 's features , withdrew across the orchard as quietly as they had come . The air was big with Bathsheba 's fortunes to - night : every word everywhere concerned her . When they were quite out of earshot all by one instinct paused . "
155009	155015	155035	155035	I	0	" said Tall , breathing . "
155022	155026	155035	155035	I	0	" said Samway . "

155047	155052	155131	155131	Laban	213	" Smallbury murmured dubiously . "
155070	155119	155131	155131	Laban	213	" We know very well that master 's on a wrong tack , and that she 's quite in the dark , and we should let 'em know at once . Laban , you know her best - you 'd better go and ask to speak to her . "
155120	155129	155164	155164	Smallbury	176	" I bain't fit for any such thing . "
155135	155151	155164	155164	Smallbury	176	" I should think William ought to do it if anybody . He 's oldest . "
155152	155162	155131	155131	Laban	213	" I shall have nothing to do with it . "
155166	155191	155220	155222	Tall reluct- antly	403	" ' Tis a ticklish business altogether . Why , he 'll go on to her himself in a few minutes , ye'll see . "
155192	155205	155220	155222	Tall reluct- antly	403	" We do n't know that he will . Come , Laban . "
155206	155219	155131	155131	Laban	213	" Very well , if I must I must , I suppose . "
155225	155231	155131	155131	Laban	213	" What must I say ? "
155232	155239	155269	155269	Samway	401	" Just ask to see master . "
155240	155262	155403	155403	Smallbury	176	" O no ; I sha n't speak to Mr. Boldwood . If I tell anybody , ' twill be mistress . "
155263	155267	155403	155403	Smallbury	176	" Very well . "
155388	155401	155437	155437	both	2457	" I should think Laban must have seen mistress by this time . "
155409	155421	155426	155426	Tall	213	" Per- haps she wo n't come and speak to him . "
155432	155435	155426	155426	Tall	213	" Well ? "
155439	155451	155533	155533	Samway	401	" I did n't like to ask for her after all . "
155456	155519	155533	155533	Samway	401	" They were all in such a stir , trying to put a little spirit into the party . Somehow the fun seems to hang fire , though everything 's there that a heart can desire , and I could n't for my soul interfere and throw damp upon it - if ' twas to save my life , I could n't ! "
155520	155531	155771	155771	he	3201	" I suppose we had better all go in together . "
155537	155551	155771	155771	he	3201	" Perhaps I may have a chance of saying a word to master . "
155761	155770	155796	155796	Her	3195	" Mrs. Troy - you are not going ? "
155774	155780	155825	155825	she	3195	" We 've hardly begun ! "
155781	155795	155825	155825	she	3195	" If you 'll excuse me , I should like to go now . "
155816	155824	155863	155863	Boldwood	224	" But as it is not late . "
155828	155846	155863	155863	Boldwood	224	" I can walk home , and leave my man and Liddy to come when they choose . "
155847	155861	155890	155890	he	224	" I 've been trying to get an opportunity of speaking to you . "
155865	155875	155899	155899	she	3195	" You know perhaps what I long to say ? "
155883	155889	155899	155899	she	3195	" You do give it ? "
155895	155898	155972	155972	he	224	" What ? "
155902	155959	156024	156024	Bathsheba	243	" Now , that 's evasion ! Why , the promise . I do n't want to intrude upon you at all , or to let it become known to anybody . But do give your word ! A mere business compact , you know , between two people who are beyond the influence of passion . "
155991	156014	156024	156024	Bathsheba	243	" A promise to marry me at the end of five years and three - quarters . You owe it to me ! "
156015	156022	156121	156121	I	0	" I feel that I do . "
156026	156052	156189	156189	You	0	" that is , if you demand it . But I am a changed woman - an unhappy woman - and not - not - - "
156053	156120	156189	156189	You	0	" You are still a very beautiful woman , said Boldwood . Honesty and pure conviction suggested the remark , unaccompanied by any perception that it might have been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win her . However , it had not much effect now , for for she said , in a passionless murmur which was in itself a proof of her words : "
156187	156188	156209	156209	I	0	" "
156200	156201	156249	156249	she	0	" "

156235	156248	156356	156356	he	3205	" O , I do n't know , pray let me go ! "
156258	156321	156516	156516	her	3206	" I am afraid what to do ! want to be just to you , and to be that seems to be wrong- ing myself , and perhaps it is breaking the commandments . There is considerable doubt of his death , and then it is dreadful ; let me ask a solicitor , Mr. Boldwood , if I ought or no ! "
156322	156355	156542	156542	you	3207	" Say the words , dear one , and the subject shall be dismissed ; a blissful loving intimacy of six years , and then marriage - O Bathsheba , say them ! "
156374	156512	156579	156579	I	0	" Promise yourself to me ; I deserve it , indeed I do , for I have loved you more than anybody in the world ! And if I said hasty words and showed uncalled - for heat of manner towards you , believe me , dear , I did not mean to distress you ; I was in agony , Bathsheba , and I did not know what I said . You would n't let a dog suffer what I have suffered , could you but know it ! Sometimes I shrink from your knowing what I have felt for you , and sometimes I am distressed that all of it you never will know . Be gracious , and give up a little to me , when I would give up my life for you ! "
156562	156575	156597	156597	I	0	" she sobbed , when she had power to frame the words . "
156586	156587	156620	156620	you	3207	" "
156613	156618	156665	156665	I	0	" she said solemnly . "
156630	156659	156722	156723	Mr. Boldwood	224	" Boldwood had come close to her side , and now he clasped one of her hands in both his own , and lifted it to his breast . "
156672	156683	156722	156723	Mr. Boldwood	224	" she ex- claimed , on seeing what he held ; "
156728	156764	156722	156723	Mr. Boldwood	224	" In her trouble at not being able to get her hand away from him at once , she stamped passionately on the floor with one foot , and tears crowded to her eyes again . "
156781	156797	156722	156723	Mr. Boldwood	224	" he said more quietly , but still retaining her hand in his firm grasp . "
156802	156812	156832	156832	You	0	" And Boldwood slipped the ring on her finger . "
156819	156831	156832	156832	You	0	" she said , weeping as if her heart would break . "
156849	156850	156930	156930	I	0	" "
156867	156902	156968	156968	I	0	" Bathsheba sat down in a chair , and buried her face in her handkerchief , though Boldwood kept her hand yet . At length she said , in a sort of hopeless whisper - "
156938	156939	157004	157004	I	0	" "
156962	156963	157004	157004	I	0	" "
156978	157003	157004	157004	I	0	" she said , fairly beaten into non - resistance . Boldwood pressed her hand , and allowed it to drop in her lap . "
157009	157013	157200	157200	you	3212	" he said . "
157018	157196	157224	157224	Laban	213	" He left the room , and when he thought she might be sufficiently composed sent one of the maids to her Bathsheba cloaked the effects of the late scene as she best could , followed the girl , and in a few moments came downstairs with her hat and cloak on , ready to go . To get to the door it was necessary to pass through the hall , and before doing so she paused on the bottom of the staircase which descended into one corner , to take a last look at the gathering . There was no music or dancing in progress just now . At the lower end , which had been arranged for the work- folk specially , a group conversed in whispers , and with clouded looks . Boldwood was standing by the fireplace , and he , too , though so absorbed in visions arising from her promise that he scarcely saw anything , seemed at that moment to have observed their peculiar manner , and their looks askance .

157316	157324	157345	157346	Mrs. Troy	353	" asked Boldwood , some- what sharply . "
157343	157344	157378	157378	they	3221	" "

157381	157391	157425	157426	Mrs. Troy	353	" the farmer asked Bathsheba , across the room . "
157399	157424	157425	157426	Mrs. Troy	353	" said Bathsheba . There was a smart rapping at the door . One of the men opened it instantly , and went outside . "
157430	157437	157457	157457	It	3222	" he said , on returning . "
157441	157445	157473	157474	A stranger	718	" said Bathsheba . "

157464	157472	157482	157482	him	3222	" said the man by the door . "
157476	157480	157482	157482	him	3222	" she said . "
157487	157597	157778	157778	Bathsheba	243	" said Boldwood . The message was given , and Troy , wrapped up to his eyes as we have seen him , stood in the doorway . There was an unearthly silence , all looking towards the newcomer . Those who had just learnt that he was in the neighbourhood recognized him instantly ; those who did not were perplexed . Nobody noted Bathsheba . She was leaning on the stairs . Her brow had heavily contracted ; her whole face was pallid , her lips apart , her eyes rigidly staring at their visitor . Boldwood was among those who did not notice that he was Troy . "
157604	157610	157780	157780	I	0	" he repeated , cheerfully , "
157621	157777	157831	157831	he	3229	" Troy next advanced into the middle of the room , took off his cap , turned down his coat - collar , and looked Boldwood in the face . Even then Boldwood did not recognize that the impersonator of Heaven 's persistent irony towards him , who had once before broken in upon his bliss , scourged him , and snatched his delight away , had come to do these things a second time . Troy began to laugh a mechanical laugh : Boldwood recognized him now . Troy turned to Bathsheba . The poor girl 's wretched- ness at this time was beyond all fancy or narration . She had sunk down on the lowest stair ; and there she sat , her mouth blue and dry , and her dark eyes fixed vacantly upon him , as if she wondered whether it were not all a terrible illusion . Then Troy spoke . "
157786	157792	157879	157879	him	3229	" She made no reply . "
157818	157830	158343	158343	Boldwood	224	" Come , madam , do you hear what I say ? "
157881	157889	158343	158343	Boldwood	224	" Bathsheba , go with your husband ! "
158334	158342	158887	158887	she	4301	" Well , it makes no difference ! "

159354	159368	159379	159380	the doctor	842	" She 's had him took away to her own house , sir , "
159373	159377	159411	159412	the doctor	842	" Who has ? "
159382	159394	159411	159412	the doctor	842	" Mrs. Troy . ' A was quite dead , sir . "
159400	159409	159490	159491	Mr. Aldritch	406	" She had no right to do that . "
159414	159434	159533	159533	he	3293	" There will have to be an inquest , and she should have waited to know what to do . "
159435	159489	159546	159546	Liddy	191	" Yes , sir ; it was hinted to her that she had better wait till the law was known . But she said law was nothing to her , and she would n't let her dear husband 's corpse bide neglected for folks to stare at for all the crowners in England . "
159526	159532	159546	159546	Liddy	191	" What has been done ? "
159536	159544	159490	159491	Mr. Aldritch	406	" I do n't know , sir . "
159552	159560	159720	159720	Oak	144	" My mistress has done it all . "
159561	159566	159810	159810	she	191	" Where is she ? "
159567	159719	159810	159810	she	191	" Upstairs with him , sir . When he was brought home and taken upstairs , she said she wanted no further help from the men . And then she called me , and made me fill the bath , and after that told me I had better go and lie down because I looked so ill . Then she locked herself into the room alone with him , and would not let a nurse come in , or anybody at all . But I thought I 'd wait in the next room in case she should want me . I heard her moving about inside for more than an hour , but she only came out once , and that was for more candles , because hers had burnt down into the socket . She said we were to let her know when you or Mr. Thirdly came , sir . "
159797	159809	159945	159946	Mr. Aldritch	406	" Oh , Mr. Aldritch , you have come at last . "
159823	159846	159945	159946	Mr. Aldritch	406	" Ah , and Mr. Thirdly . Well , all is done , and anybody in the world may see him now . "

There were two muffs , sable and ermine . Above all there was a case of jewellery , containing four heavy gold bracelets and several lockets and rings , all of fine quality and manu- facture . These things had been bought in Bath and other towns from time to time , and brought home by stealth . They were all carefully packed in paper , and each package was labelled "
160989	161199	160875	160875	ladies	4997	" a date being subjoined six years in advance in every instance . These somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed with care and love were the subject of discourse in Warren 's malt - house when Oak entered from Caster- bridge with tidings of the kiln glow shone upon it , told the tale sufficiently well . Boldwood , as every one supposed he would do , had pleaded guilty , and had been sentenced to death . The conviction that Boldwood had not been morally responsible for his later acts now became general . Facts elicited previous to the trial had pointed strongly in the same direction , but they had not been of sufficient weight to lead to an order for an examination into the state of Boldwood 's mind . It was astonishing , now that a presumption of insanity was raised , how many collateral circumstances were remembered to which a condition of mental disease seemed to afford the only explanation - among others , the unprecedented neglect of his corn stacks in the previous summer . A petition was addressed to the Home Secretary , advancing the circumstances which appeared to justify a request for a reconsideration of the sentence . It was not "
161202	161514	161534	161534	I	0	" by the inhabitants of Caster- bridge , as is usual in such cases , for Boldwood had never made many friends over the counter . The shops thought it very natural that a man who , by importing direct from the producer , had daringly set aside the first great principle of provincial existence , namely that God made country villages to supply customers to county towns , should have confused ideas about the Decalogue . The prompters were a few merciful men who had perhaps too feelingly considered the facts latterly unearthed , and the result was that evidence was taken which it was hoped might remove the crime in a moral point of view , out of the category of wilful murder , and lead it to be regarded as a sheer outcome of madness . The upshot of the petition was waited for in Weather- bury with solicitous interest . The execution had been fixed for eight o'clock on a Saturday morning about a fortnight after the sentence was passed , and up to Friday afternoon no answer had been received . At that time Gabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol , whither he had been to wish Boldwood good - bye , and turned down a by - street to avoid the town . When past the last house he heard a hammering , and lifting his bowed head he looked back for a moment . Over the chimneys he could see the upper part of the gaol entrance , rich and glowing in the afternoon sun , and some moving figures were there . They were carpenters lifting a post into a vertical position within the parapet . He with- drew his eyes quickly , and hastened on . It was dark when he reached home , and half the village was out to meet him . "

Gabriel 's anxiety was great that Boldwood might be saved , even though in his conscience he felt that he ought to die ; for there had been qualities in the farmer which Oak loved . At last , when they all were weary the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance - First dead , as if on turf it trode , Then , clattering on the village road In other pace than forth he yode . "

162109	162833	162847	162847	you	146	" CHAPTER LVI BEAUTY IN LONELINESS - AFTER ALL BATHSHEBA revived with the spring . The utter prostration that had followed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished perceptibly when all un- certainty upon every subject had come to an end . But she remained alone now for the greater part of her time , and stayed in the house , or at furthest went into the garden . She shunned every one , even Liddy , and could be brought to make no confidences , and to ask for no sympathy . As the summer drew on she passed more of her time in the open air , and began to examine into farming matters from sheer necessity , though she never rode out or personally superintended as at former times . One Friday evening in August she walked a little way along the road and entered the village for the first time since the sombre event of the preceding Christmas . None of the old colour had as yet come to her cheek , and its absolute paleness was heightened by the jet black of her gown , till it appeared preternatural . When she reached a little shop at the other end of the place , which stood nearly opposite to the churchyard , Bath- sheba heard singing inside the church , and she knew that the singers were practising . She crossed the road , opened the gate , and entered the graveyard , the high sills of the church windows effectually screening her from the eyes of those gathered within . Her stealthy walk was to the nook wherein Troy had worked at planting flowers upon Fanny Robin 's grave , and she came to the marble tombstone . A motion of satisfaction enlivened her face as she read the complete inscription . First came the words of Troy himself : - ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY IN BELOVED MEMORY OF FANNY ROBIN , WHO DIED OCTOBER 9 , 18 - , AGED 20 YEARS . Underneath this was now inscribed in new letters : - IN THE SAME GRAVE LIE THE REMAINS OF THE AFORESAID FRANCIS TROY , WHO DIED DECEMBER 24TH , 18 - , Whilst she stood and read and meditated the tones of the organ began again in the church , and she went with the same light step round to the porch and listened . The door was closed , and the choir was learning a new hymn . Bathsheba was stirred by emotions which latterly she had assumed to be altogether dead within her . The little attenuated voices of the children brought to her ear in destinct utterance the words they sang without thought or comprehension - Lead , kindly Light , amid the encircling gloom , Lead Thou me on . Bathsheba 's feeling was always to some extent de- pendent upon her whim , as is the case with many other women . Something big came into her throat and an uprising to her eyes - and she thought that she would allow the imminent tears to flow if they wished . They did flow and plenteously , and one fell upon the stone bench beside her . Once that she had begun to cry for she hardly knew what , she could not leave off for crowd- ing thoughts she knew too well . She would have given anything in the world to be , as those children were , un- concerned at the meaning of their words , because too innocent to feel the necessity for any such expression . All the impassioned scenes of her brief expenence seemed to revive with added emotion at that moment , and those scenes which had been without emotion during enactment had emotion then . Yet grief came to her rather as a luxury than as the scourge of former times . Owing to Bathsheba 's face being buried in her hands she did not notice a form which came quietly into the porch , and on seeing her , first moved as if to retreat , then paused and regarded her . Bathsheba did not raise her head for some time , and when she looked round her face was wet , and her eyes drowned and dim . "
162837	162843	162847	162847	you	146	" exclaimed she , disconcerted , "

162937	162954	163055	163055	he	3373	" Indeed : I was n't aware of that . I 'll leave you , then . "
162970	162992	163055	163055	he	3373	" Do n't let me drive you away , mistress . I think I wo n't go in to - night . "
162993	163053	163081	163081	she	3374	" O no - you do n't drive me away . Then they stood in a state of some embarrassment Bathsheba trying to wipe her dreadfully drenched and inflamed face without his noticing her . At length Oak said , I 've not seen you - i mean spoken to you - since ever so long , have I ? "
163069	163076	163115	163115	you	146	" Were you going into church ? "

163176	163185	163247	163247	he	146	" Gabriel murmured when he saw the date . "
163193	163224	163247	163247	he	146	" And to me as if it were years ago - long years , and I had been dead between . And now I am going home , Mr. Oak . "
163230	163246	163228	163228	her	3377	" I wanted to name a small matter to you as soon as I could . "
163253	163274	163306	163306	I	0	" Merrily about business , and I think I may just mention it now , if you 'll allow me . "

163362	163367	163400	163400	your	144	" Oak stammered out . "

163566	163575	164435	164436	Mr. Oak	146	" said Gabriel , in a distressed tone . "
163596	164434	164449	164450	Mr. Oak	146	" he concluded , in evident anxiety to get away , and at once went out of the churchyard by a path she could follow on no pretence whatever . Bathsheba went home , her mind occupied with a new trouble , which being rather harassing than deadly was calculated to do good by diverting her from the chronic gloom of her life . She was set thinking a great deal about Oak and of his which to shun her ; and there occurred to Bathsheba several incidents of latter in- tercourse with him , which , trivial when singly viewed amounted together to a perceptible disinclination for her society . It broke upon her at length as a great pain that her last old disciple was about to forsake her and flee . He who had believed in her and argued on her side when all the rest of the world was against her , had at last like the others become weary and neglectful of the old cause , and was leaving her to fight her battles alone . Three weeks went on , and more evidence of his want of interest in her was forthcoming . She noticed that instead of entering the small parlour or office where the farm accounts were kept , and waiting , or leaving a memorandum as he had hitherto done during her seclusion , Oak never came at all when she was likely to be there , only entering at unseasonable hours when her presence in that part of the house was least to be expected . Whenever he wanted directions he sent a message , or note with neither heading nor signature , to which she was obliged to reply in the same off - hand style . Poor Bathsheba began to suffer now from the most torturing sting of ali - a sensation that she was despised . The autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these melancholy conjectures , and Christmas - day came , com- pleting a year of her legal widowhood , and two years and a quarter of her life alone . On examining her heart it appeared beyond measure strange that the sub- ject of which the season might have been supposed suggestive - the event in the hall at Boldwood 's - was not agitating her at all ; but instead , an agonizing con- viction that everybody abjured her - for what she could not tell - and that Oak was the ringleader of the recusants . Coming out of church that day she looked round in hope that Oak , whose bass voice she had heard rolling out from the gallery overhead in a most unconcerned manner , might chance to linger in her path in the old way . There he was , as usual , coming down the path behind her . But on seeing Bathsheba turn , he looked aside , and as soon as he got beyond the gate , and there was the barest excuse for a divergence , he made one , and vanished . The next morning brought the culminating stroke ; she had been expecting it long . It was a formal notice by letter from him that he should not renew his engage- ment with her for the following Lady - day . Bathsheba actually sat and cried over this letter most bitterly . She was aggrieved and wounded that the possession of hopeless love from Gabriel , which she had AFTER ALL grown to regard as her inalienable right for life , should have been withdrawn just at his own pleasure in this way . She was bewildered too by the prospect of having to rely on her own resources again : it seemed to herself that she never could again acquire energy sufficient to go to market , barter , and sell . Since Troy 's death Oak had attended all sales and fairs for her , transacting her business at the same time with his own . What should she do now ? Her life was becoming a desolation . So desolate was Bathsheba this evening , that in an absolute hunger for pity and sympathy , and miserable in that she appeared to have outlived the only true friend- ship she had ever owned , she put on her bonnet and cloak and went down to Oak 's house just after sunset , guided on her way by the pale primrose rays of a crescent moon a few days old . A lively firelight shone from the window , but nobody was visible in the room . She tapped nervously , and then thought it doubtful if it were right for a single woman to call upon a bachelor who lived alone , although he was her manager , and she might be supposed to call on business without any real impropriety . Gabriel opened the door , and the moon shone upon his fore- haad . "
164438	164444	164478	164478	I	0	" said Bathsheba , faintly . "
164452	164456	164489	164489	Gabriel	144	" said Gabriel . "

164491	164499	164516	164516	I	0	" she said , in pathetic tones . "
164522	164530	164596	164596	I	0	" Oak replied , with some awkwardness . "
164538	164539	164596	164596	I	0	" "
164605	164614	164763	164763	I	0	" Oak placed two or three for her . "
164623	164756	164763	164763	I	0	" So down she sat , and down sat he , the fire dancing in their faces , and upon the old furniture all a - sheenen Wi ' long years o ' handlen , that formed Oak 's array of household possessions , which sent back a dancing reflection in reply . It was very odd to these two persons , who knew each other passing well , that the mere circumstance of their meeting in a new place and in a new way should make them so awkward and constrained . In the fields , or at her house , there had never been any embarrassment ; but now that Oak had become the entertainer their lives seemed to be moved back again to the days when they were strangers .

165423	165429	165447	165449	My own dear	3400	" Because you never ask . "
165434	165446	165453	165453	You	144	" said Gabriel , with a low laugh of joyous- ness . "

Nobody knows the heat and fret I have been caused by it . "
165628	165634	165650	165650	she	410	" And was that all ? "
165635	165638	165702	165702	she	410	" All . "

165663	165701	165741	165741	Oak	144	" I have thought so much more of you since I fancied you did not want even to see me again . But I must be going now , or I shall be missed . Why Gabriel . "
165717	165732	165781	165781	He	144	" it seems exactly as if I had come courting you - how dreadful ! "
165733	165739	166004	166004	Bathsheba	410	" And quite right too . "
165743	165780	166056	166056	he	144	" I 've danced at your skittish heels , my beautiful Bathsheba , for many a long mile , and many a long day ; and it is hard to be- grudge me this one visit . "
165984	166000	166056	166056	he	144	" THE most private , secret , plainest wedding that it is possible to have . "
166042	166055	166206	166206	Oak	144	" A licence - O yes , it must be a licence . "
166063	166074	166206	166206	Oak	144	" Very well , then ; first , a license . "
166195	166204	166222	166222	Coggan	180	" Well , good - night , Coggan . "
166208	166216	166222	166222	Coggan	180	" I 'm going down this way . "
166217	166220	166274	166274	Gabriel	144	" Oh ! "
166226	166241	166206	166206	Oak	144	" what 's going on to- night then , make so bold Mr. Oak ? "
166277	166286	166256	166256	Coggan	180	" You can keep a secret , Coggan ? "
166287	166297	166274	166274	Gabriel	144	" You 've proved me , and you know . "
166298	166325	166206	166206	Oak	144	" Yes , I have , and I do know . Well , then , mistress and I mean to get married to - morrow morning . "
166326	166378	166256	166256	Coggan	180	" Heaven 's high tower ! And yet I 've thought of such a thing from time to time ; true , I have . But keeping it so close ! Well , there , ' tis no consarn of amine , and I wish ' ee joy o ' her . "
166379	166469	166274	166274	Gabriel	144	" Thank you , Coggan . But I assure ' ee that this great hush is not what I wished for at all , or what either of us would have wished if it had n't been for certain things that would make a gay wedding seem hardly the thing . Bathsheba has a great wish that all the parish shall not be in church , looking at her - she 's shylike and nervous about it , in fact - so I be doing this to humour her . "
166470	166497	166527	166527	Coggan	180	" Ay , I see : quite right , too , I suppose I must say . And you be now going down to the clerk . "
166498	166509	166527	166527	Coggan	180	" Yes ; you may as well come with me . "
166510	166525	166571	166571	Oak	144	" I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away . "
166534	166553	166571	166571	Oak	144	" Labe Tall 's old woman will horn it all over parish in half - an - hour . "
166554	166569	166614	166614	Coggan	180	" So she will , upon my life ; I never thought of that . "
166575	166599	166614	166614	Coggan	180	" Yet I must tell him to- night , I suppose , for he 's working so far off , and leaves early . "
166600	166612	166699	166699	herself	211	" I 'll tell ' ee how we could tackle her . "
166616	166677	166685	166685	Coggan	180	" I 'll knock and ask to speak to Laban outside the door , you standing in the background . Then he 'll come out , and you can tell yer tale . She 'll never guess what I want en for ; and I 'll make up a few words about the farm - work , as a blind . "
166703	166713	166765	166765	Coggan	180	" I wanted to have a word with Laban . "
166714	166751	166787	166788	Mrs. Tall	211	" He 's not at home , and wo n't be this side of eleven o'clock . He've been forced to go over to Yalbury since shutting out work . I shall do quite as well . "
166752	166763	166797	166797	Coggan	180	" I hardly think you will . Stop a moment ; "
166777	166785	166820	166820	Oak	144	" Who 's t'other man , then ? "
166790	166795	166820	166820	Oak	144	" Only a friend . "
166799	166818	166854	166854	Coggan	180	" Say he 's wanted to meet mistress near church - hatch to - morrow morning at ten . "
166826	166840	166854	166854	Coggan	180	" That he must come without fail , and wear his best clothes . "
166841	166852	166867	166867	her	211	" The clothes will floor us as safe as houses ! "
166856	166865	166970	166970	Coggan	180	" It ca n't be helped said Oak . "
166869	166876	167013	167013	Bathsheba	410	" So Coggan delivered the message . "
166893	166969	167013	167013	Bathsheba	410	" ' Tis very particular , indeed . The fact is , ' tis to witness her sign some law - work about taking shares wi ' another farmer for a long span o ' years . There , that 's what ' tis , and now I 've told ' ee , Mother Tall , in a way I should n't ha ' done if I had n't loved ' ee so hopeless well . "
167008	167011	167013	167013	Bathsheba	410	" Liddy . "
167022	167043	167087	167088	CONCLUSION Bathsheba	243	" I want you to call me at seven o'clock to - morrow , In case I should n't wake . "
167044	167055	167160	167162	the bewildered Liddy	191	" But you always do wake afore then , ma'am . "
167056	167086	167160	167162	the bewildered Liddy	191	" Yes , but I have something important to do , which I 'll tell you of when the time comes , and it 's best to make sure . "
167145	167158	167208	167208	I	0	" But I thought it was I who had to call you ? "
167164	167172	167208	167208	I	0	" And it is n't six yet . "
167219	167241	167256	167256	I	0	" When Liddy came to Bathsheba 's room her mistress was already waiting . Liddy could not understand this extraordinary promptness . "
167249	167253	167291	167292	Farmer Oak	143	" she said . "
167261	167275	167314	167314	ma'am	712	" said Bathsheba , with a mischiev- ous smile in her bright eyes . "
167289	167290	167314	167314	ma'am	712	" "

167343	167370	167390	167390	mine	0	" Bathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek , and whispered in Liddy 's ear , although there was nobody present . Then Liddy stared and exclaimed , "

167396	167400	167390	167390	mine	0	" said Bathsheba . "
167412	167806	167818	167819	those fellows	3436	" It was a damp disagreeable morning . Nevertheless , at twenty minutes to ten o'clock , Oak came out of his house , and Went up the hill side With that sort of stride A man puts out when walking in search of a bride , and knocked Bathsheba 's door . Ten minutes later a large and a smaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door , and through the mist along the road to the church . The distance was not more than a quarter of a mile , and these two sensible persons deemed it unnecessary to drive . An observer must have been very close indeed to discover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of Oak and Bathsheba , arm - in- arm for the first time in their lives , Oak in a greatcoat extending to his knees , and Bathsheba in a cloak that reached her clogs . Yet , though so plainly dressed there was a certain rejuvenated appearance about her : - As though a rose should shut and be a bud again . Repose had again incarnadined her cheeks ; and having , at Gabriel 's request , arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago on Norcombe Hill , she seemed in his eyes remarkably like a girl of that fascinating dream , which , considering that she was now only three or four - and - twenty , was perhaps not very wonderful . In the church were Tall , Liddy , and the parson , and in a remarkably short space of time the deed was done . The two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba 's parlour in the evening of the same day , for it had been arranged that Farmer Oak should go there to live , since he had as yet neither money , house , nor furniture worthy of the name , though he was on a sure way towards them , whilst Bathsheba was , comparatively , in a plethora of all three . Just as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea , their ears were greeted by the firing of a cannon , followed by what seemed like a tremendous blowing of trumpets , in the front of the house . "
167809	167815	167818	167819	those fellows	3436	" said Oak , laughing , "
167832	167888	167995	167995	Jan	180	" Oak took up the light and went into the porch , followed by Bathsheba with a shawl over her head . The rays fell upon a group of male figures gathered upon the gravel in front , who , when they saw the newly - married couple in the porch , set up a loud "
167891	167987	167995	167995	Jan	180	" and at the same moment bang again went the cannon in the background , followed by a hideous clang of music from a drum , tambourine , clarionet , serpent , hautboy , tenor- viol , and double - bass - the only remaining relics of the true and original Weatherbury band - venerable worm- eaten instruments , which had celebrated in their own persons the victories of Marlhorough , under the fingers of the forefathers of those who played them now . The performers came forward , and marched up to the front . "
168005	168009	167995	167995	Jan	180	" said Oak . "
168029	168030	168118	168118	ye	3440	" "
168036	168046	168118	168118	ye	3440	" said Mr. Clark , with evident self- denial . "

168341	168354	None	None	None	None	" said Joseph Poorgrass with a cheerful sigh as they moved away ; "
168390	168401	None	None	None	None	" Ephraim is joined to idols : let him alone . "
