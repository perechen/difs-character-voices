3658	3669	3670	3670	Cedric	39	" Did you ever know many marquises , Mr. Hobbs ? "
3673	3677	3670	3670	Cedric	39	" or earls ? "
3678	3681	3683	3684	Mr. Hobbs	46	" No , "
3689	3725	3683	3684	Mr. Hobbs	46	" I guess not . I 'd like to catch one of 'em inside here ; that 's all ! I 'll have no grasping tyrants sittin ' ' round on my cracker - barrels ! "
3744	3757	3759	3759	Cedric	39	" Perhaps they would n't be earls if they knew any better , "
3770	3775	3777	3778	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Would n't they ! "
3780	3798	3777	3778	Mr. Hobbs	46	" They just glory in it ! It 's in 'em . They 're a bad lot . "

3936	3943	3933	3933	he	39	" Is it the hot weather ? "

4610	4674	4598	4598	she	144	" I know your papa would wish it to be so , Ceddie . He loved his home very much ; and there are many things to be thought of that a little boy ca n't quite understand . I should be a selfish little mother if I did not send you . When you are a man , you will see why . "
4681	4692	4693	4693	he	49	" I shall be very sorry to leave Mr. Hobbs , "
4696	4718	4693	4693	he	49	" I 'm afraid he 'll miss me , and I shall miss him . And I shall miss them all . "
4890	4893	4895	4896	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Hello ! "
4898	4902	4895	4896	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Mornin ' ! "
4903	4908	4910	4910	Cedric	39	" Good - morning , "
4959	4962	4963	4963	he	46	" Hello ! "
4976	4980	4981	4981	he	39	" Mr. Hobbs , "
4984	4996	4981	4981	he	39	" do you remember what we were talking about yesterday morning ? "
4997	5000	5002	5003	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Well , "
5013	5014	4981	4981	he	39	" "
5017	5021	4981	4981	he	39	" said Cedric ; "
5033	5043	5025	5025	Mary	42	" Mr. Hobbs rubbed the back of his head . "
5053	5054	5047	5048	Queen Victoria	52	" "
5057	5064	5047	5048	Queen Victoria	52	" said Cedric , rather hesitatingly , "
5074	5075	5071	5071	you	46	" "
5080	5085	5086	5086	we	349	" returned Mr. Hobbs ; "
5098	5142	5143	5143	You	46	" Cedric flushed up to the curly bang on his forehead . Nothing so embarrassing as this had ever happened to him in his life . He was a little afraid that it might be a trifle embarrassing to Mr. Hobbs , too . "
5146	5150	5143	5143	You	46	" he proceeded , "
5166	5167	5143	5143	You	46	" "
5172	5179	5169	5169	I	0	" returned Mr. Hobbs , stoutly . "
5193	5194	5195	5196	Mr. Hobbs	46	" "
5198	5202	5195	5196	Mr. Hobbs	46	" said Cedric , "
5211	5221	5195	5196	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Mr. Hobbs almost jumped out of his chair . "
5224	5228	5195	5196	Mr. Hobbs	46	" he exclaimed . "
5231	5239	5195	5196	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Cedric announced , with due modesty ; "
5256	5274	5250	5250	I	0	" Mr. Hobbs looked agitated . He rose up suddenly and went to look at the thermometer . "
5283	5297	5250	5250	I	0	" he exclaimed , turning back to examine his young friend 's countenance . "
5322	5342	5315	5315	you	46	" He put his big hand on the little boy 's hair . This was more embarrassing than ever . "
5346	5350	5344	5344	you	46	" said Ceddie ; "
5401	5416	5396	5396	he	51	" Mr. Hobbs sank into his chair and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief . "
5425	5429	5396	5396	he	51	" he exclaimed . "
5432	5436	5396	5396	he	51	" returned Cedric , "
5473	5488	5471	5471	him	51	" Mr. Hobbs stared wildly at the innocent , serious little face before him . "
5494	5527	5528	5528	I	0	" he asked . Cedric put his hand in his pocket and carefully drew out a piece of paper , on which something was written in his own round , irregular hand . "
5543	5553	5536	5536	I	0	" he said . And he read aloud slowly : "
5668	5801	5657	5658	my grandpapa	357	" Mr. Hobbs seemed to grow hotter and hotter . He mopped his forehead and his bald spot and breathed hard . He began to see that something very remarkable had happened ; but when he looked at the little boy sitting on the cracker - box , with the innocent , anxious expression in his childish eyes , and saw that he was not changed at all , but was simply as he had been the day before , just a handsome , cheerful , brave little fellow in a blue suit and red neck - ribbon , all this information about the nobility bewildered him . He was all the more bewildered because Cedric gave it with such ingenuous simplicity , and plainly without realizing himself how stupendous it was . "
5811	5816	5805	5805	you	0	" Mr. Hobbs inquired . "
5825	5829	5819	5820	Cedric Errol	39	" answered Cedric . "
5857	5858	5838	5838	He	51	" "
5861	5866	5838	5838	He	51	" said Mr. Hobbs , "
5872	6001	5838	5838	He	51	" This was an exclamation he always used when he was very much astonished or excited . He could think of nothing else to say just at that puzzling moment . Cedric felt it to be quite a proper and suitable ejaculation . His respect and affection for Mr. Hobbs were so great that he admired and approved of all his remarks . He had not seen enough of society as yet to make him realize that sometimes Mr. Hobbs was not quite conventional . He knew , of course , that he was different from his mamma , but , then , his mamma was a lady , and he had an idea that ladies were always different from gentlemen . He looked at Mr. Hobbs wistfully . "
6013	6017	5838	5838	He	51	" he asked . "
6025	6030	5838	5838	He	51	" Mr. Hobbs answered . "
6038	6042	5838	5838	He	51	" said Cedric . "
6067	6068	6064	6065	Mr. Hobbs	46	" "
6076	6081	6064	6065	Mr. Hobbs	46	" said Mr. Hobbs . "
6084	6088	6064	6065	Mr. Hobbs	46	" said Cedric , "
6103	6104	6101	6101	we	377	" "
6111	6116	6101	6101	we	377	" Mr. Hobbs answered . "
6133	6134	6124	6124	you	0	" "
6137	6145	6124	6124	you	0	" remarked Cedric , with a sigh , "
6158	6159	6160	6160	You	0	" "
6163	6168	6160	6160	You	0	" said Mr. Hobbs , "
6177	6178	6179	6179	I	0	" "
6184	6188	6179	6179	I	0	" answered Cedric . "
6256	6874	6249	6249	I	0	" His conversation with Mr. Hobbs was a long and serious one . Once having got over the first shock , Mr. Hobbs was not so rancorous as might have been expected ; he endeavored to resign himself to the situation , and before the interview was at an end he had asked a great many questions . As Cedric could answer but few of them , he endeavored to answer them himself , and , being fairly launched on the subject of earls and marquises and lordly estates , explained many things in a way which would probably have astonished Mr. Havisham , could that gentleman have heard it . But then there were many things which astonished Mr. Havisham . He had spent all his life in England , and was not accustomed to American people and American habits . He had been connected professionally with the family of the Earl of Dorincourt for nearly forty years , and he knew all about its grand estates and its great wealth and importance ; and , in a cold , business - like way , he felt an interest in this little boy , who , in the future , was to be the master and owner of them all , the future Earl of Dorincourt . He had known all about the old Earl 's disappointment in his elder sons and all about his fierce rage at Captain Cedric 's American marriage , and he knew how he still hated the gentle little widow and would not speak of her except with bitter and cruel words . He insisted that she was only a common American girl , who had entrapped his son into marrying her because she knew he was an earl 's son . The old lawyer himself had more than half believed this was all true . He had seen a great many selfish , mercenary people in his life , and he had not a good opinion of Americans . When he had been driven into the cheap street , and his coupe had stopped before the cheap , small house , he had felt actually shocked . It seemed really quite dreadful to think that the future owner of Dorincourt Castle and Wyndham Towers and Chorlworth , and all the other stately splendors , should have been born and brought up in an insignificant house in a street with a sort of green - grocery at the corner . He wondered what kind of a child he would be , and what kind of a mother he had . He rather shrank from seeing them both . He had a sort of pride in the noble family whose legal affairs he had conducted so long , and it would have annoyed him very much to have found himself obliged to manage a woman who would seem to him a vulgar , money - loving person , with no respect for her dead husband 's country and the dignity of his name . It was a very old name and a very splendid one , and Mr. Havisham had a great respect for it himself , though he was only a cold , keen , business - like old lawyer . When Mary handed him into the small parlor , he looked around it critically . It was plainly furnished , but it had a home - like look ; there were no cheap , common ornaments , and no cheap , gaudy pictures ; the few adornments on the walls were in good taste and about the room were many pretty things which a woman 's hand might have made . "
6882	6889	6249	6249	I	0	" he had said to himself ; "
6898	7301	6892	6893	the Captain	168	" But when Mrs. Errol came into the room , he began to think she herself might have had something to do with it . If he had not been quite a self - contained and stiff old gentleman , he would probably have started when he saw her . She looked , in the simple black dress , fitting closely to her slender figure , more like a young girl than the mother of a boy of seven . She had a pretty , sorrowful , young face , and a very tender , innocent look in her large brown eyes , the sorrowful look that had never quite left her face since her husband had died . Cedric was used to seeing it there ; the only times he had ever seen it fade out had been when he was playing with her or talking to her , and had said some old - fashioned thing , or used some long word he had picked up out of the newspapers or in his conversations with Mr. Hobbs . He was fond of using long words , and he was always pleased when they made her laugh , though he could not understand why they were laughable ; they were quite serious matters with him . The lawyer 's experience taught him to read people 's characters very shrewdly , and as soon as he saw Cedric 's mother he knew that the old Earl had made a great mistake in thinking her a vulgar , mercenary woman . Mr. Havisham had never been married , he had never even been in love , but he divined that this pretty young creature with the sweet voice and sad eyes had married Captain Errol only because she loved him with all her affectionate heart , and that she had never once thought it an advantage that he was an earl 's son . And he saw he should have no trouble with her , and he began to feel that perhaps little Lord Fauntleroy might not be such a trial to his noble family , after all . The Captain had been a handsome fellow , and the young mother was very pretty , and perhaps the boy might be well enough to look at . When he first told Mrs. Errol what he had come for , she turned very pale . "
7304	7308	6892	6893	the Captain	168	" she said ; "
7351	7367	7340	7340	I	0	" And her sweet young voice trembled , and the tears rushed into her eyes . "
7379	7389	7390	7390	I	0	" she said . The lawyer cleared his throat . "
7397	7401	7390	7390	I	0	" he said , "
7657	7725	7726	7727	Captain Errol	39	" He felt a little uneasy lest she should begin to cry or make a scene , as he knew some women would have done . It embarrassed and annoyed him to see women cry . But she did not . She went to the window and stood with her face turned away for a few moments , and he saw she was trying to steady herself . "
7734	7740	7741	7741	He	39	" she said at last . "
7811	7829	7830	7830	My	0	" Then she came back to the table and stood looking up at Mr. Havisham very gently . "
7836	7840	7830	7830	My	0	" she said . "
7937	7938	7939	7939	She	417	" "
7946	7951	7939	7939	She	417	" the lawyer thought . "
7961	7962	7963	7963	Madam	405	" "
7965	7970	7963	7963	Madam	405	" he said aloud , "
8034	8035	8036	8036	I	0	" "
8039	8052	8036	8036	I	0	" said the tender little mother , in a rather broken voice , "
8076	8156	8070	8070	he	153	" Mr. Havisham cleared his throat again . He could not quite imagine the gouty , fiery - tempered old Earl loving any one very much ; but he knew it would be to his interest to be kind , in his irritable way , to the child who was to be his heir . He knew , too , that if Ceddie were at all a credit to his name , his grandfather would be proud of him . "
8167	8171	8163	8163	I	0	" he replied . "
8197	8271	8185	8185	you	425	" He did not think it would be discreet to repeat the exact words the Earl had used , which were in fact neither polite nor amiable . Mr. Havisham preferred to express his noble patron 's offer in smoother and more courteous language . He had another slight shock when Mrs. Errol asked Mary to find her little boy and bring him to her , and Mary told her where he was . "
8282	8286	8273	8273	I	0	" she said ; "
8339	8340	8341	8342	Mr. Hobbs	46	" "
8350	8358	8359	8359	He	46	" Mrs. Errol said to the lawyer . "
8375	8713	8714	8714	He	431	" Remembering the glimpse he had caught of the store as he passed it , and having a recollection of the barrels of potatoes and apples and the various odds and ends , Mr. Havisham felt his doubts arise again . In England , gentlemen 's sons did not make friends of grocerymen , and it seemed to him a rather singular proceeding . It would be very awkward if the child had bad manners and a disposition to like low company . One of the bitterest humiliations of the old Earl 's life had been that his two elder sons had been fond of low company . Could it be , he thought , that this boy shared their bad qualities instead of his father 's good qualities ? He was thinking uneasily about this as he talked to Mrs. Errol until the child came into the room . When the door opened , he actually hesitated a moment before looking at Cedric . It would , perhaps , have seemed very queer to a great many people who knew him , if they could have known the curious sensations that passed through Mr. Havisham when he looked down at the boy , who ran into his mother 's arms . He experienced a revulsion of feeling which was quite exciting . He recognized in an instant that here was one of the finest and handsomest little fellows he had ever seen . His beauty was something unusual . He had a strong , lithe , graceful little body and a manly little face ; he held his childish head up , and carried himself with a brave air ; he was so like his father that it was really startling ; he had his father 's golden hair and his mother 's brown eyes , but there was nothing sorrowful or timid in them . They were innocently fearless eyes ; he looked as if he had never feared or doubted anything in his life . "
8730	8744	8714	8714	He	431	" was what Mr. Havisham thought . What he said aloud was simply , "
8753	8969	8970	8970	He	433	" And , after this , the more he saw of little Lord Fauntleroy , the more of a surprise he found him . He knew very little about children , though he had seen plenty of them in England fine , handsome , rosy girls and boys , who were strictly taken care of by their tutors and governesses , and who were sometimes shy , and sometimes a trifle boisterous , but never very interesting to a ceremonious , rigid old lawyer . Perhaps his personal interest in little Lord Fauntleroy 's fortunes made him notice Ceddie more than he had noticed other children ; but , however that was , he certainly found himself noticing him a great deal . Cedric did not know he was being observed , and he only behaved himself in his ordinary manner . He shook hands with Mr. Havisham in his friendly way when they were introduced to each other , and he answered all his questions with the unhesitating readiness with which he answered Mr. Hobbs . He was neither shy nor bold , and when Mr. Havisham was talking to his mother , the lawyer noticed that he listened to the conversation with as much interest as if he had been quite grown up . "
8980	8988	8991	8991	he	433	" Mr. Havisham said to the mother . "
8998	9002	8991	8991	he	433	" she answered . "
9074	9167	9064	9064	he	433	" The next time Mr. Havisham met him , he saw that this last was quite true . As his coupe turned the corner , he caught sight of a group of small boys , who were evidently much excited . Two of them were about to run a race , and one of them was his young lordship , and he was shouting and making as much noise as the noisiest of his companions . He stood side by side with another boy , one little red leg advanced a step . "
9174	9179	9064	9064	he	433	" yelled the starter . "
9190	9272	9275	9276	Ced Errol	55	" Mr. Havisham found himself leaning out of the window of his coupe with a curious feeling of interest . He really never remembered having seen anything quite like the way in which his lordship 's lordly little red legs flew up behind his knickerbockers and tore over the ground as he shot out in the race at the signal word . He shut his small hands and set his face against the wind ; his bright hair streamed out behind . "
9278	9290	9275	9276	Ced Errol	55	" all the boys shouted , dancing and shrieking with excitement . "
9312	9313	9310	9310	Ray	57	" "
9323	9382	9383	9383	I	0	" said Mr. Havisham . The way in which the red legs flew and flashed up and down , the shrieks of the boys , the wild efforts of Billy Williams , whose brown legs were not to be despised , as they followed closely in the rear of the red legs , made him feel some excitement . "
9395	9463	9383	9383	I	0	" he said , with an apologetic sort of cough . At that moment , the wildest yell of all went up from the dancing , hopping boys . With one last frantic leap the future Earl of Dorincourt had reached the lamp - post at the end of the block and touched it , just two seconds before Billy Williams flung himself at it , panting . "
9470	9476	9467	9468	Ceddie Errol	49	" yelled the little boys . "
9482	9503	9479	9480	Ceddie Errol	49	" Mr. Havisham drew his head in at the window of his coupe and leaned back with a dry smile . "
9509	9578	9579	9579	You	438	" he said . As his carriage stopped before the door of Mrs. Errol 's house , the victor and the vanquished were coming toward it , attended by the clamoring crew . Cedric walked by Billy Williams and was speaking to him . His elated little face was very red , his curls clung to his hot , moist forehead , his hands were in his pockets . "
9582	9600	9601	9601	I	0	" he was saying , evidently with the intention of making defeat easy for his unsuccessful rival , "
9646	10126	9640	9640	I	0	" And this view of the case seemed to cheer Billy Williams so much that he began to smile on the world again , and felt able to swagger a little , almost as if he had won the race instead of losing it . Somehow , Ceddie Errol had a way of making people feel comfortable . Even in the first flush of his triumphs , he remembered that the person who was beaten might not feel so gay as he did , and might like to think that he MIGHT have been the winner under different circumstances . That morning Mr. Havisham had quite a long conversation with the winner of the race a conversation which made him smile his dry smile , and rub his chin with his bony hand several times . Mrs. Errol had been called out of the parlor , and the lawyer and Cedric were left together . At first Mr. Havisham wondered what he should say to his small companion . He had an idea that perhaps it would be best to say several things which might prepare Cedric for meeting his grandfather , and , perhaps , for the great change that was to come to him . He could see that Cedric had not the least idea of the sort of thing he was to see when he reached England , or of the sort of home that waited for him there . He did not even know yet that his mother was not to live in the same house with him . They had thought it best to let him get over the first shock before telling him . Mr. Havisham sat in an arm - chair on one side of the open window ; on the other side was another still larger chair , and Cedric sat in that and looked at Mr. Havisham . He sat well back in the depths of his big seat , his curly head against the cushioned back , his legs crossed , and his hands thrust deep into his pockets , in a quite Mr. Hobbs - like way . He had been watching Mr. Havisham very steadily when his mamma had been in the room , and after she was gone he still looked at him in respectful thoughtfulness . There was a short silence after Mrs. Errol went out , and Cedric seemed to be studying Mr. Havisham , and Mr. Havisham was certainly studying Cedric . He could not make up his mind as to what an elderly gentleman should say to a little boy who won races , and wore short knickerbockers and red stockings on legs which were not long enough to hang over a big chair when he sat well back in it . But Cedric relieved him by suddenly beginning the conversation himself . "
10131	10135	10128	10128	you	439	" he said , "
10145	10146	10149	10149	you	439	" "
10151	10156	10149	10149	you	439	" said Mr. Havisham . "
10159	10163	10149	10149	you	439	" replied Ceddie . "
10185	10186	10183	10183	you	439	" "
10190	10195	10183	10183	you	439	" answered Mr. Havisham . "
10200	10204	10197	10197	you	439	" said Ceddie respectfully "
10214	10230	10206	10206	you	439	" Sometimes when he used his long words he did not pronounce them quite correctly . "
10237	10238	10242	10242	queen	444	" "
10249	10254	10242	10242	queen	444	" said Mr. Havisham . "
10277	10278	10289	10290	the President	290	" "
10281	10285	10289	10290	the President	290	" said Cedric ; "
10292	10293	10289	10290	the President	290	" "
10297	10302	10289	10290	the President	290	" said Mr. Havisham . "
10311	10312	10289	10290	the President	290	" "
10315	10320	10289	10290	the President	290	" answered Ceddie cheerfully . "
10379	10403	10372	10372	I	0	" he said , rather hastily , lest Mr. Havisham might feel it impolite in him not to have wished to be one , "
10425	10426	10414	10414	I	0	" "
10436	10441	10414	10414	I	0	" said Mr. Havisham . "
10445	10449	10414	10414	I	0	" asked Cedric . "
10460	10491	10492	10493	An earl	322	" Mr. Havisham crossed his own legs and put the tips of his fingers carefully together . He thought perhaps the time had come to explain matters rather more clearly . "
10501	10505	10496	10499	a very important person	458	" he began . "
10511	10516	10508	10509	a president	453	" put in Ceddie . "
10546	10547	10538	10539	Mr. Hobbs	46	" "
10551	10564	10548	10549	An earl	322	" Mr. Havisham went on , feeling rather uncertain of his ground , "
10571	10572	10538	10539	Mr. Hobbs	46	" "
10577	10581	10538	10539	Mr. Hobbs	46	" asked Ceddie . "
10589	10590	10538	10539	Mr. Hobbs	46	" "
10593	10605	10538	10539	Mr. Hobbs	46	" said Cedric , thrusting his hands deeper into his pockets . "
10779	10800	10764	10764	She	462	" Mr. Havisham felt rather at a loss as he looked at his companion 's innocent , serious little face . "
10811	10815	10804	10804	you	465	" he explained . "
10871	10872	10886	10886	him	58	" "
10877	10881	10886	10886	him	58	" said Ceddie . "
10940	10941	10933	10933	he	58	" "
10948	10954	10933	10933	he	58	" said Mr. Havisham solemnly , "
10964	10965	10957	10958	an earl	322	" "
10970	10974	10957	10958	an earl	322	" said Ceddie . "
11022	11023	11024	11028	A great many of them	478	" "
11053	11054	11055	11055	I	0	" "
11063	11067	11061	11061	myself	0	" said Cedric . "
11155	11156	11149	11150	George Washington	58	" "
11168	11190	11163	11164	an earl	322	" said Mr. Havisham slowly , and he fixed his shrewd eyes on the little boy with a rather curious expression . "
11200	11219	11191	11192	Some earls	490	" He was curious because he wondered if his young friend knew what the power of money was . "
11228	11233	11191	11192	Some earls	490	" said Ceddie innocently . "
11244	11245	11247	11247	you	491	" "
11249	11254	11247	11247	you	491	" said Mr. Havisham . "
11258	11259	11247	11247	you	491	" "
11262	11266	11247	11247	you	491	" explained Cedric , "
11406	11407	11399	11399	her	284	" "
11410	11415	11399	11399	her	284	" said Mr. Havisham . "
11427	11428	11423	11423	you	0	" "
11529	11530	11528	11528	Dick	59	" "
11535	11540	11528	11528	Dick	59	" asked Mr. Havisham . "
11548	11565	11541	11541	Dick	59	" said his young lordship , quite warming up in his interest in plans so exciting . "
11780	11781	11767	11767	he	59	" "
11792	11806	11785	11785	you	0	" inquired the lawyer , rubbing his chin and smiling a queer smile . "
11809	11824	11785	11785	you	0	" said Lord Fauntleroy , settling himself in his chair with a business air , "
11831	11832	11828	11828	Jake	60	" "
11838	11843	11844	11844	He	59	" Mr. Havisham asked . "
12005	12130	11994	11994	He	59	" There could have been nothing more confiding and innocent than the way in which his small lordship told his little story , quoting his friend Dick 's bits of slang in the most candid good faith . He seemed to feel not a shade of a doubt that his elderly companion would be just as interested as he was himself . And in truth Mr. Havisham was beginning to be greatly interested ; but perhaps not quite so much in Dick and the apple - woman as in this kind little lordling , whose curly head was so busy , under its yellow thatch , with good - natured plans for his friends , and who seemed somehow to have forgotten himself altogether . "
12134	12138	11994	11994	He	59	" he began . "
12151	12152	11994	11994	He	59	" "
12157	12163	11994	11994	He	59	" answered Lord Fauntleroy briskly ; "
12260	12261	12251	12251	I	0	" "
12265	12270	12251	12251	I	0	" exclaimed Mr. Havisham . "
12276	12284	12251	12251	I	0	" explained Cedric , becoming quite excited . "
12327	12337	12338	12338	I	0	" The door opened and Mrs. Errol came in . "
12351	12358	12338	12338	I	0	" she said to Mr. Havisham ; "
12375	12376	12377	12379	This young gentleman	528	" "
12381	12386	12377	12379	This young gentleman	528	" said Mr. Havisham , "
12409	12410	12411	12411	Bridget	61	" "
12418	12423	12411	12411	Bridget	61	" said Mrs. Errol ; "
12451	12461	12438	12438	She	61	" Cedric slipped down out of his big chair . "
12471	12475	12438	12438	She	61	" he said , "
12516	12562	12509	12509	He	528	" He ran out of the room , and Mr. Havisham rose from his chair . He seemed to have something in his mind which he wished to speak of . He hesitated a moment , and then said , looking down at Mrs. Errol : "
12708	12732	12697	12698	the Earl	203	" For the second time , he did not repeat the Earl 's exact words . His lordship had , indeed , said : "
12788	12934	12782	12783	his grandfather	335	" His motives were far from being good , and if he had been dealing with a nature less affectionate and warm - hearted than little Lord Fauntleroy 's , great harm might have been done . And Cedric 's mother was too gentle to suspect any harm . She thought that perhaps this meant that a lonely , unhappy old man , whose children were dead , wished to be kind to her little boy , and win his love and confidence . And it pleased her very much to think that Ceddie would be able to help Bridget . It made her happier to know that the very first result of the strange fortune which had befallen her little boy was that he could do kind things for those who needed kindness . Quite a warm color bloomed on her pretty young face . "
12937	12941	12782	12783	his grandfather	335	" she said , "
13028	13105	13106	13106	I	0	" Mr. Havisham put his thin hand in his breast pocket and drew forth a large pocket - book . There was a queer look in his keen face . The truth was , he was wondering what the Earl of Dorincourt would say when he was told what was the first wish of his grandson that had been granted . He wondered what the cross , worldly , selfish old nobleman would think of it . "
13115	13119	13111	13111	you	551	" he said , "
13177	13178	13167	13167	I	0	" "
13187	13192	13167	13167	I	0	" exclaimed Mrs. Errol . "
13210	13211	13201	13201	I	0	" "
13217	13227	13201	13201	I	0	" said Mr. Havisham , with his dry smile . "
13251	13252	13201	13201	I	0	" "
13255	13260	13201	13201	I	0	" cried his mother . "
13294	13322	13292	13292	Ceddie	49	" The lawyer slightly cleared his throat . It touched his worldly , hard old heart to see the tender , timid look in her brown eyes . "
13328	13332	13326	13326	madam	405	" he said , "
13379	13405	13372	13372	I	0	" Then his mother went for Cedric and brought him back into the parlor . Mr. Havisham heard him talking before he entered the room . "
13413	13418	13372	13372	I	0	" he was saying , "
13464	13483	13484	13484	Dearest	48	" His little face looked quite anxious when he came in . He was very sorry for Bridget . "
13490	13497	13486	13486	you	48	" he said to Mr. Havisham . "
13505	13537	13503	13503	Bridget	61	" Mr. Havisham looked down at him a moment . He felt a little awkward and undecided . As Cedric 's mother had said , he was a very little boy . "
13542	13576	13577	13577	Ceddie	49	" he began , and then he glanced involuntarily at Mrs. Errol . Little Lord Fauntleroy 's mother suddenly kneeled down by him and put both her tender arms around his childish body . "
13579	13583	13584	13585	the Earl	203	" she said , "
13703	13735	13700	13700	he	62	" And she kissed the child on his round cheek , where the bright color suddenly flashed up in his excited amazement . He looked from his mother to Mr. Havisham . "
13742	13746	13737	13737	I	0	" he cried . "
13761	13791	13792	13792	Bridget	61	" Mr. Havisham handed him the money . It was in fresh , clean greenbacks and made a neat roll . Ceddie flew out of the room with it . "
13794	13807	13792	13792	Bridget	61	" they heard him shout , as he tore into the kitchen . "
13845	13846	13849	13850	Master Ceddie	64	" "
13852	13863	13849	13850	Master Ceddie	64	" cried Bridget , in an awe - stricken voice . "
13879	13880	13881	13881	I	0	" "
13894	14354	13883	13883	I	0	" Mrs. Errol said . So she , too , went out of the room and Mr. Havisham was left alone for a while . He went to the window and stood looking out into the street reflectively . He was thinking of the old Earl of Dorincourt , sitting in his great , splendid , gloomy library at the castle , gouty and lonely , surrounded by grandeur and luxury , but not really loved by any one , because in all his long life he had never really loved any one but himself ; he had been selfish and self - indulgent and arrogant and passionate ; he had cared so much for the Earl of Dorincourt and his pleasures that there had been no time for him to think of other people ; all his wealth and power , all the benefits from his noble name and high rank , had seemed to him to be things only to be used to amuse and give pleasure to the Earl of Dorincourt ; and now that he was an old man , all this excitement and self - indulgence had only brought him ill health and irritability and a dislike of the world , which certainly disliked him . In spite of all his splendor , there was never a more unpopular old nobleman than the Earl of Dorincourt , and there could scarcely have been a more lonely one . He could fill his castle with guests if he chose . He could give great dinners and splendid hunting parties ; but he knew that in secret the people who would accept his invitations were afraid of his frowning old face and sarcastic , biting speeches . He had a cruel tongue and a bitter nature , and he took pleasure in sneering at people and making them feel uncomfortable , when he had the power to do so , because they were sensitive or proud or timid . Mr. Havisham knew his hard , fierce ways by heart , and he was thinking of him as he looked out of the window into the narrow , quiet street . And there rose in his mind , in sharp contrast , the picture of the cheery , handsome little fellow sitting in the big chair and telling his story of his friends , Dick and the apple - woman , in his generous , innocent , honest way . And he thought of the immense income , the beautiful , majestic estates , the wealth , and power for good or evil , which in the course of time would lie in the small , chubby hands little Lord Fauntleroy thrust so deep into his pockets . "
14362	14368	13883	13883	I	0	" he said to himself . "
14376	14435	14436	14436	She	572	" Cedric and his mother came back soon after . Cedric was in high spirits . He sat down in his own chair , between his mother and the lawyer , and fell into one of his quaint attitudes , with his hands on his knees . He was glowing with enjoyment of Bridget 's relief and rapture . "
14439	14443	14444	14444	She	572	" he said . "
14513	14513	14497	14497	I	0	"
14700	14713	14715	14715	Cedric	65	" For I have to go to England and be a lord , "
14721	14779	14715	14715	Cedric	65	" And I should n't like to have your bones on my mind every time it rained . My own bones never hurt , so I think I do n't know how painful a person 's bones can be , but I 've sympathized with you a great deal , and I hope you 'll be better . "
14780	14790	14791	14791	he	65	" She 's a very good apple - woman , "
14823	14863	14791	14791	he	65	" Once , when I fell down and cut my knee , she gave me an apple for nothing . I 've always remembered her for it . You know you always remember people who are kind to you . "
15052	15056	15057	15057	he	59	" I soy ! "
15060	15068	15057	15057	he	59	" what 're yer givin ' us ? "
15083	15092	15093	15093	he	51	" Everybody thinks it not true at first , "
15096	15188	15093	15093	he	51	" Mr. Hobbs thought I 'd had a sunstroke . I did n't think I was going to like it myself , but I like it better now I 'm used to it . The one who is the Earl now , he 's my grandpapa ; and he wants me to do anything I like . He 's very kind , if he IS an earl ; and he sent me a lot of money by Mr. Havisham , and I 've brought some to you to buy Jake out . "
15298	15305	15306	15306	he	65	" Well , good - bye , "
15333	15397	15326	15326	he	65	" And I hope trade'll be good . I 'm sorry I 'm going away to leave you , but perhaps I shall come back again when I 'm an earl . And I wish you 'd write to me , because we were always good friends . And if you write to me , here 's where you must send your letter . "
15407	15430	15431	15431	Dick	59	" And my name is n't Cedric Errol any more ; it 's Lord Fauntleroy and and good - bye , Dick . "
15497	15506	15507	15507	he	65	" I wish ye was n't goin' away , "
15533	15560	15561	15561	he	65	" Thanky , sir , fur bringin ' him down here an ' fur wot ye've done , He 's he 's a queer little feller , "
15564	15592	15561	15561	he	65	" I 've allers thort a heap of him . He 's such a game little feller , an ' an ' such a queer little un . "
15730	15738	15740	15740	Cedric	39	" There 's something written on it , "
15742	15787	15740	15740	Cedric	39	" inside the case . I told the man myself what to say . ' From his oldest friend , Lord Fauntleroy , to Mr. Hobbs . When this you see , remember me . ' I do n't want you to forget me . "
15797	15803	15804	15804	he	46	" I sha'n't forget you , "
15817	15834	15804	15804	he	46	" nor do n't you go and forget me when you get among the British arrystocracy . "
15835	15847	15849	15850	his lordship	207	" I should n't forget you , whoever I was among , "
15852	15940	15804	15804	he	46	" I 've spent my happiest hours with you ; at least , some of my happiest hours . I hope you 'll come to see me sometime . I 'm sure my grandpapa would be very much pleased . Perhaps he 'll write and ask you , when I tell him about you . You you would n't mind his being an earl , would you , I mean you would n't stay away just because he was one , if he invited you to come ? "
15941	15949	15951	15952	Mr. Hobbs	46	" I 'd come to see you , "
16128	16141	16142	16142	he	39	" We liked this little house , Dearest , did n't we ? "
16145	16156	16142	16142	he	39	" We always will like it , wo n't we ? "
16157	16161	16162	16162	she	144	" Yes yes , "
16172	16177	16162	16162	she	144	" Yes , darling . "
16491	16499	16500	16500	he	441	" I 've run all the way , "
16503	16572	16573	16573	He	441	" I 've come down to see ye off . Trade 's been prime ! I bought this for ye out o ' what I made yesterday . Ye kin wear it when ye get among the swells . I lost the paper when I was tryin ' to get through them fellers downstairs . They did n't want to let me up . It 's a hankercher . "
16601	16606	16607	16607	he	39	" Good - bye ! "
16610	16620	16607	16607	he	39	" Wear it when ye get among the swells . "
16723	16739	16715	16717	the people on	637	" Good - bye ! Good - bye ! Good - bye , old fellow ! "
16747	16768	16740	16741	Every one	184	" Do n't forget us . Write when you get to Liverpool . Good - bye ! Good - bye ! "
16780	16787	16788	16788	he	50	" Good - bye , Dick ! "
16793	16803	16788	16788	he	50	" Thank you ! Good - bye , Dick ! "
16872	16879	16881	16883	little Lord Fauntleroy	50	" Good - bye , Dick ! "
17019	17031	17032	17032	she	151	" My house is not far from the Castle , Ceddie , "
17041	17108	17032	17032	she	151	" a very little way from yours , and you can always run in and see me every day , and you will have so many things to tell me ! and we shall be so happy together ! It is a beautiful place . Your papa has often told me about it . He loved it very much ; and you will love it too . "
17109	17120	17121	17123	his small lordship	2614	" I should love it better if you were there , "
17150	17152	17193	17193	she	43	" Dearest "
17182	17192	17193	17193	she	43	" I should prefer he should not be told , "
17199	17328	17193	17193	she	43	" He would not really understand ; he would only be shocked and hurt ; and I feel sure that his feeling for the Earl will be a more natural and affectionate one if he does not know that his grandfather dislikes me so bitterly . He has never seen hatred or hardness , and it would be a great blow to him to find out that any one could hate me . He is so loving himself , and I am so dear to him ! It is better for him that he should not be told until he is much older , and it is far better for the Earl . It would make a barrier between them , even though Ceddie is such a child . "
17461	17468	17469	17469	he	51	" I do n't like it , "
17486	17580	17469	17469	he	51	" You do n't know how much I do n't like it ; but there are a great many troubles in this world , and you have to bear them . Mary says so , and I 've heard Mr. Hobbs say it too . And Dearest wants me to like to live with my grandpapa , because , you see , all his children are dead , and that 's very mournful . It makes you sorry for a man , when all his children have died and one was killed suddenly . "
17702	17715	17716	17716	he	663	" And so you are going to try to like the Earl , "
17719	17722	17716	17716	he	663	" Yes , "
17727	17806	17716	17716	he	663	" He 's my relation , and of course you have to like your relations ; and besides , he 's been very kind to me . When a person does so many things for you , and wants you to have everything you wish for , of course you 'd like him if he was n't your relation ; but when he 's your relation and does that , why , you 're very fond of him . "
17807	17812	17814	17815	Mr. Havisham	51	" Do you think , "
17817	17826	17814	17815	Mr. Havisham	51	" that he will be fond of you ? "
17827	17830	17832	17832	Cedric	39	" Well , "
17834	17903	17832	17832	Cedric	39	" I think he will , because , you see , I 'm his relation , too , and I 'm his boy 's little boy besides , and , well , do n't you see of course he must be fond of me now , or he would n't want me to have everything that I like , and he would n't have sent you for me . "
17904	17907	17909	17910	the lawyer	2506	" Oh ! "
17912	17920	17909	17910	the lawyer	2506	" that 's it , is it ? "
17921	17924	17926	17926	Cedric	39	" Yes , "
17928	17954	17926	17926	Cedric	39	" that 's it . Do n't you think that 's it , too ? Of course a man would be fond of his grandson . "
18163	18165	18191	18191	he	655	" tops'ls "
18167	18170	18191	18191	he	655	" mains'ls , "
18227	18239	18191	18191	he	655	" Shiver my timbers , but it 's a cold day ! "
18258	18262	18191	18191	he	655	" elderly naval man "
18344	18353	18355	18356	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" That is why he is so bald , "
18361	18488	18355	18356	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" After you have been scalped several times the hair never grows again . Jerry 's never grew again after that last time , when the King of the Parromachaweekins did it with the knife made out of the skull of the Chief of the Wopslemumpkies . He says it was one of the most serious times he ever had . He was so frightened that his hair stood right straight up when the king flourished his knife , and it never would lie down , and the king wears it that way now , and it looks something like a hair - brush . I never heard anything like the asperiences Jerry has had ! I should so like to tell Mr. Hobbs about them ! "
18524	18526	18528	18528	Jerry	68	" asperiences "
18598	18607	18608	18608	he	702	" Jerry 's stories int'rust them very much , "
18614	18696	18608	18608	he	702	" For my part you must excuse me , Dearest but sometimes I should have thought they could n't be all quite true , if they had n't happened to Jerry himself ; but as they all happened to Jerry well , it 's very strange , you know , and perhaps sometimes he may forget and be a little mistaken , as he 's been scalped so often . Being scalped a great many times might make a person forgetful . "
18869	18877	18878	18878	he	50	" Did you get here , Mary ? "
18881	18888	18890	18890	he	50	" Here 's Mary , Dearest , "
18900	18910	18890	18890	he	50	" I am glad you are here , Mary , "
18921	18939	18941	18941	she	43	" It is such a comfort to me to see you . It takes the strangeness away . "
18960	19060	18941	18941	she	43	" must feel to this little mother who had left her own land and was about to give up her child . The English servants looked with curiosity at both the boy and his mother . They had heard all sorts of rumors about them both ; they knew how angry the old Earl had been , and why Mrs. Errol was to live at the lodge and her little boy at the castle ; they knew all about the great fortune he was to inherit , and about the savage old grandfather and his gout and his tempers . "
19074	19174	19070	19072	poor little chap	721	" they had said among themselves . But they did not know what sort of a little lord had come among them ; they did not quite understand the character of the next Earl of Dorincourt . He pulled off his overcoat quite as if he were used to doing things for himself , and began to look about him . He looked about the broad hall , at the pictures and stags ' antlers and curious things that ornamented it . They seemed curious to him because he had never seen such things before in a private house . "
19177	19181	19175	19175	Dearest	2411	" he said , "
19210	19272	19298	19298	herself	426	" It was quite a large house compared to the one in the shabby New York street , and it was very pretty and cheerful . Mary led them upstairs to a bright chintz - hung bedroom where a fire was burning , and a large snow - white Persian cat was sleeping luxuriously on the white fur hearth - rug . "
19291	19295	19296	19296	It	426	" explained Mary . "
19439	19607	19428	19437	a foiner little felly niver sthipped in shoe - leather	738	" ' When they were ready , they went downstairs into another big bright room ; its ceiling was low , and the furniture was heavy and beautifully carved , the chairs were deep and had high massive backs , and there were queer shelves and cabinets with strange , pretty ornaments on them . There was a great tiger - skin before the fire , and an arm - chair on each side of it . The stately white cat had responded to Lord Fauntleroy 's stroking and followed him downstairs , and when he threw himself down upon the rug , she curled herself up grandly beside him as if she intended to make friends . Cedric was so pleased that he put his head down by hers , and lay stroking her , not noticing what his mother and Mr. Havisham were saying . They were , indeed , speaking in a rather low tone . Mrs. Errol looked a little pale and agitated . "
19616	19620	19621	19621	He	739	" she said . "
19630	19631	19621	19621	He	739	" "
19634	19644	19621	19621	He	739	" answered Mr. Havisham in the same low tone ; "
19680	19758	19759	19759	His	739	" Mrs. Errol glanced down at Cedric . He was lying in a graceful , careless attitude upon the black - and - yellow skin ; the fire shone on his handsome , flushed little face , and on the tumbled , curly hair spread out on the rug ; the big cat was purring in drowsy content , she liked the caressing touch of the kind little hand on her fur . Mrs. Errol smiled faintly . "
19772	19785	19759	19760	His lordship	207	" she said rather sadly . Then she looked at the lawyer . "
19795	19799	19787	19787	you	744	" she said , "
19809	19810	19787	19787	you	744	" "
19814	19819	19787	19787	you	744	" Mr. Havisham exclaimed . "
19833	19834	19826	19826	he	739	" "
19837	19844	19826	19826	he	739	" she answered , quite simply ; "
19957	19964	19948	19949	his father	150	" Mr. Havisham rubbed his chin . "
19970	19974	19948	19949	his father	150	" he said . "
19987	19988	19981	19981	He	739	" "
20001	20005	19991	19991	he	739	" she said . "
20041	20051	20029	20029	he	748	" Mr. Havisham looked reflective for a few moments . "
20058	20175	20052	20052	I	0	" he said afterward . And then the dinner was brought in and they sat down together , the big cat taking a seat on a chair near Cedric 's and purring majestically throughout the meal . When , later in the evening , Mr. Havisham presented himself at the Castle , he was taken at once to the Earl . He found him sitting by the fire in a luxurious easy - chair , his foot on a gout - stool . He looked at the lawyer sharply from under his shaggy eyebrows , but Mr. Havisham could see that , in spite of his pretense at calmness , he was nervous and secretly excited . "
20178	20182	20052	20052	I	0	" he said ; "
20198	20199	20200	20201	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" "
20210	20215	20216	20216	They	752	" replied Mr. Havisham . "
20228	20243	20216	20216	They	752	" The Earl made a half - impatient sound and moved his hand restlessly . "
20249	20254	20216	20216	They	752	" he said brusquely . "
20277	20278	20279	20279	His	50	" "
20300	20326	20292	20292	I	0	" The Earl 's elbow was resting on the arm of his chair ; he put his hand up and shielded his eyes with it . "
20329	20333	20292	20292	I	0	" he said ; "
20383	20409	20372	20373	the mother	2567	" Mr. Havisham drank a little of the glass of port he had poured out for himself , and sat holding it in his hand . "
20425	20448	20453	20453	he	50	" he said cautiously . The Earl 's prejudices were very intense . He looked up quickly and uttered a rough word . "
20455	20459	20449	20450	A fool	760	" he exclaimed . "
20473	20474	20475	20475	I	0	" "
20487	20498	20475	20475	I	0	" replied the lawyer in his dry , deliberate fashion . "
20516	20568	20512	20514	a fine lad	764	" His manner of speech was always deliberate and unenthusiastic , but he made it a trifle more so than usual . He had a shrewd fancy that it would be better that the Earl should judge for himself , and be quite unprepared for his first interview with his grandson . "
20575	20580	20512	20514	a fine lad	764	" asked my lord . "
20591	20596	20512	20514	a fine lad	764	" replied the lawyer . "
20607	20673	20675	20677	a handsome boy	765	" demanded the Earl . A very slight smile touched Mr. Havisham 's thin lips . There rose up before his mind 's eye the picture he had left at Court Lodge , the beautiful , graceful child 's body lying upon the tiger - skin in careless comfort the bright , tumbled hair spread on the rug the bright , rosy boy 's face . "
20689	20693	20679	20679	I	0	" he said , "
20719	20720	20715	20715	I	0	" "
20729	20741	20721	20721	I	0	" snarled the Earl , a twinge of gout seizing him . "
20760	20761	20753	20753	I	0	" "
20771	20776	20777	20777	I	0	" said Mr. Havisham . "
20810	20811	20786	20786	He	765	" "
20815	20820	20821	20821	I	0	" protested the Earl . "
20847	20906	20907	20907	I	0	" Mr. Havisham drank some more port . He seldom argued with his lordly patron , never when his lordly patron 's noble leg was inflamed by gout . At such times it was always better to leave him alone . So there was a silence of a few moments . It was Mr. Havisham who broke it . "
20917	20921	20922	20922	I	0	" he remarked . "
20931	20936	20942	20942	her	43	" growled his lordship ; "
20946	20947	20942	20942	her	43	" "
20955	20960	20961	20961	She	43	" explained the lawyer . "
20975	20981	20961	20961	She	43	" The Earl started visibly . "
20986	20991	20961	20961	She	43	" he cried out . "
20996	21003	21004	21004	She	43	" Mr. Havisham repeated his words . "
21021	21022	21004	21004	She	43	" "
21026	21032	21036	21036	they	775	" ejaculated my lord savagely ; "
21064	21065	21056	21056	I	0	" "
21069	21074	21056	21056	I	0	" said Mr. Havisham , "
21098	21099	21088	21088	She	43	" "
21105	21111	21112	21112	She	43	" snapped his noble lordship . "
21191	21192	21193	21193	She	43	" "
21199	21204	21193	21193	She	43	" said Mr. Havisham . "
21216	21221	21222	21222	She	43	" blustered my lord . "
21273	21274	21264	21264	she	43	" "
21277	21282	21264	21264	she	43	" said Mr. Havisham . "
21300	21301	21302	21302	I	0	" "
21310	21331	21332	21332	She	43	" panted the Earl , out of breath with anger and excitement and gout . But Mr. Havisham delivered it . "
21450	21472	21437	21437	She	43	" The Earl sank back into his chair . His deep - set fierce old eyes gleamed under his beetling brows . "
21477	21484	21437	21437	She	43	" he said , still breathlessly . "
21500	21501	21493	21494	the mother	2567	" "
21509	21515	21493	21494	the mother	2567	" replied the lawyer coolly . "
21581	21582	21583	21583	He	50	" "
21588	21593	21583	21583	He	50	" said the Earl . "
21602	21607	21597	21597	my	0	" said Mr. Havisham , "
21656	21657	21644	21644	you	785	" "
21662	21667	21644	21644	you	785	" said the Earl . "
21676	21677	21678	21678	He	50	" "
21690	21695	21697	21697	she	151	" returned Mr. Havisham ; "
21703	21703	21697	21697	she	151	"
21998	22004	22006	22007	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" Does she know me ? "
22009	22019	22021	22021	he	50	" I think she must think she knows me . "
22033	22039	22040	22040	he	50	" How do you do ? "
22044	22049	22040	22040	he	50	" Good - afternoon ! "
22075	22081	22082	22082	she	816	" God bless your lordship ! "
22085	22104	22082	22082	she	816	" God bless your pretty face ! Good luck and happiness to your lordship ! Welcome to you ! "
22122	22128	22129	22129	he	50	" I like that woman , "
22132	22165	22129	22129	he	50	" She looks as if she liked boys . I should like to come here and play with her children . I wonder if she has enough to make up a company ? "
22471	22482	22483	22483	he	39	" It 's a beautiful place , is n't it ? "
22489	22506	22483	22483	he	39	" I never saw such a beautiful place . It 's prettier even than Central Park . "
22522	22528	22529	22529	he	39	" How far is it , "
22535	22544	22529	22529	he	39	" from the gate to the front door ? "
22545	22554	22556	22557	the lawyer	2506	" It is between three and four miles , "
22559	22574	22576	22577	his lordship	207	" That 's a long way for a person to live from his gate , "
22634	22641	22642	22642	he	39	" Has there been a circus ? "
22645	22657	22642	22642	he	39	" or do they live here always ? Whose are they ? "
22658	22663	22664	22665	Mr. Havisham	51	" They live here , "
22669	22679	22664	22665	Mr. Havisham	51	" They belong to the Earl , your grandfather . "
22756	22767	22769	22769	Cedric	39	" It 's the most beautiful place I ever saw ! "
22778	22802	22769	22769	Cedric	39	" It reminds any one of a king 's palace . I saw a picture of one once in a fairy - book . "
23035	23044	23045	23045	he	51	" This is Lord Fauntleroy , Mrs. Mellon , "
23048	23062	23045	23045	he	51	" Lord Fauntleroy , this is Mrs. Mellon , who is the housekeeper . "
23074	23083	23084	23084	he	39	" Was it you who sent the cat ? "
23087	23097	23084	23084	he	39	" I 'm much obliged to you , ma'am . "
23120	23128	23129	23129	she	845	" I should know his lordship anywhere , "
23135	23155	23129	23129	she	845	" He has the Captain 's face and way . It 's a great day , this , sir . "
23204	23213	23214	23214	she	72	" The cat left two beautiful kittens here , "
23217	23229	23214	23214	she	72	" they shall be sent up to your lordship 's nursery . "
23243	23250	23251	23252	Mrs. Mellon	72	" In the library , sir , "
23255	23265	23251	23252	Mrs. Mellon	72	" His lordship is to be taken there alone . "
23292	23299	23271	23276	the very tall footman in livery	851	" Lord Fauntleroy , my lord , "
23562	23565	23566	23566	he	867	" Dougal , "
23569	23575	23566	23566	he	867	" come back , sir . "
23874	23880	23881	23881	he	39	" Are you the Earl ? "
23884	23903	23881	23881	he	39	" I 'm your grandson , you know , that Mr. Havisham brought . I 'm Lord Fauntleroy . "
23926	23934	23935	23935	he	39	" I hope you are very well , "
23943	23952	23935	23935	he	39	" I 'm very glad to see you . "
24007	24016	24017	24017	he	203	" Glad to see me , are you ? "
24020	24023	24017	24017	he	203	" Yes , "
24028	24031	24017	24017	he	203	" very . "
24094	24105	24106	24106	he	50	" I 've kept wondering what you would look like , "
24109	24131	24106	24106	he	50	" I used to lie in my berth in the ship and wonder if you would be anything like my father . "
24132	24136	24138	24139	the Earl	203	" Am I ? "
24141	24144	24145	24145	Cedric	39	" Well , "
24148	24177	24145	24145	Cedric	39	" I was very young when he died , and I may not remember exactly how he looked , but I do n't think you are like him . "
24178	24186	24188	24189	his grandfather	335	" You are disappointed , I suppose ? "
24191	24196	24198	24198	Cedric	39	" Oh , no , "
24201	24247	24198	24198	Cedric	39	" Of course you would like any one to look like your father ; but of course you would enjoy the way your grandfather looked , even if he was n't like your father . You know how it is yourself about admiring your relations . "
24309	24317	24319	24320	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" Any boy would love his grandfather , "
24322	24337	24319	24320	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" especially one that had been as kind to him as you have been . "
24349	24352	24353	24353	he	50	" Oh ! "
24356	24367	24353	24353	he	50	" I have been kind to you , have I ? "
24368	24371	24373	24374	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" Yes , "
24377	24398	24373	24374	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" I 'm ever so much obliged to you about Bridget , and the apple - woman , and Dick . "
24399	24402	24404	24405	the Earl	203	" Bridget ! "
24407	24415	24404	24405	the Earl	203	" Dick ! The apple - woman ! "
24416	24419	24421	24421	Cedric	39	" Yes ! "
24423	24447	24421	24421	Cedric	39	" the ones you gave me all that money for the money you told Mr. Havisham to give me if I wanted it . "
24448	24451	24453	24454	his lordship	207	" Ha ! "
24456	24490	24491	24491	He	203	" That 's it , is it ? The money you were to spend as you liked . What did you buy with it ? I should like to hear something about that . "
24519	24522	24524	24525	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" Oh ! "
24527	24569	24524	24525	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" perhaps you did n't know about Dick and the apple - woman and Bridget . I forgot you lived such a long way off from them . They were particular friends of mine . And you see Michael had the fever "
24570	24575	24577	24578	the Earl	203	" Who 's Michael ? "
24580	24731	24577	24578	the Earl	203	" Michael is Bridget 's husband , and they were in great trouble . When a man is sick and ca n't work and has twelve children , you know how it is . And Michael has always been a sober man . And Bridget used to come to our house and cry . And the evening Mr. Havisham was there , she was in the kitchen crying , because they had almost nothing to eat and could n't pay the rent ; and I went in to see her , and Mr. Havisham sent for me and he said you had given him some money for me . And I ran as fast as I could into the kitchen and gave it to Bridget ; and that made it all right ; and Bridget could scarcely believe her eyes . That 's why I 'm so obliged to you . "
24732	24735	24737	24738	the Earl	203	" Oh ! "
24744	24762	24737	24738	the Earl	203	" that was one of the things you did for yourself , was it ? What else ? "
24927	24934	24935	24935	he	39	" Well , there was Dick , "
24938	24949	24935	24935	he	39	" You 'd like Dick , he 's so square . "
24961	24967	24968	24968	he	39	" What does that mean ? "
25009	25022	25023	25023	he	39	" I think it means that he would n't cheat any one , "
25026	25062	25023	25023	he	39	" or hit a boy who was under his size , and that he blacks people 's boots very well and makes them shine as much as he can . He 's a perfessional bootblack . "
25063	25075	25077	25078	the Earl	203	" And he 's one of your acquaintances , is he ? "
25080	25089	25091	25092	his grandson	538	" He is an old friend of mine , "
25094	25118	25119	25119	He	203	" Not quite as old as Mr. Hobbs , but quite old . He gave me a present just before the ship sailed . "
25162	25168	25170	25172	his young lordship	2570	" He gave me this , "
25174	25255	25170	25172	his young lordship	2570	" I shall keep it always . You can wear it round your neck or keep it in your pocket . He bought it with the first money he earned after I bought Jake out and gave him the new brushes . It 's a keepsake . I put some poetry in Mr. Hobbs 's watch . It was , ' When this you see , remember me . ' When this I see , I shall always remember Dick . "
26232	26238	26223	26223	he	50	" What is the matter ? "
26243	26251	26223	26223	he	50	" Why do n't you go on ? "
26281	26294	26295	26295	he	50	" I was just thinking that perhaps you might n't like it , "
26298	26317	26295	26295	he	50	" Perhaps some one belonging to you might have been there . I forgot you were an Englishman . "
26318	26324	26326	26327	my lord	762	" You can go on , "
26329	26347	26326	26327	my lord	762	" No one belonging to me was there . You forgot you were an Englishman , too . "
26348	26353	26355	26355	Cedric	39	" Oh ! no , "
26358	26364	26355	26355	Cedric	39	" I 'm an American ! "
26365	26371	26373	26374	the Earl	203	" You are an Englishman , "
26377	26384	26373	26374	the Earl	203	" Your father was an Englishman . "
26427	26434	26435	26435	he	39	" I was born in America , "
26438	26457	26435	26435	he	39	" You have to be an American if you are born in America . I beg your pardon , "
26464	26492	26493	26494	The Earl	41	" for contradicting you . Mr. Hobbs told me , if there were another war , you know , I should have to to be an American . "
26512	26519	26520	26520	he	41	" You would , would you ? "
26611	26620	26621	26621	he	39	" Would you like me to help you ? "
26625	26658	26621	26621	he	39	" You could lean on me , you know . Once when Mr. Hobbs hurt his foot with a potato - barrel rolling on it , he used to lean on me . "
26766	26775	26776	26776	he	203	" Do you think you could do it ? "
26780	26786	26788	26788	Cedric	39	" I THINK I could , "
26790	26836	26837	26837	He	39	" I 'm strong . I 'm seven , you know . You could lean on your stick on one side , and on me on the other . Dick says I 've a good deal of muscle for a boy that 's only seven . "
26887	26890	26892	26893	the Earl	203	" Well , "
26895	26900	26892	26893	the Earl	203	" you may try . "
27025	27031	27032	27032	he	50	" Just lean on me , "
27040	27047	27032	27032	he	50	" I 'll walk very slowly . "
27138	27148	27149	27149	he	203	" Do n't be afraid of leaning on me , "
27152	27167	27149	27149	he	203	" I 'm all right if if it is n't a very long way . "
27256	27270	27271	27271	he	39	" Does your foot hurt you very much when you stand on it ? "
27274	27307	27271	27271	he	39	" Did you ever put it in hot water and mustard ? Mr. Hobbs used to put his in hot water . Arnica is a very nice thing , they tell me . "
27454	27465	27466	27466	he	39	" It 's a warm night , is n't it ? "
27469	27491	27466	27466	he	39	" Perhaps you need a fire because because of your foot , but it seems just a little warm to me . "
27520	27530	27532	27533	the Earl	203	" You have been doing some rather hard work , "
27535	27540	27542	27543	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" Oh , no ! "
27545	27568	27542	27543	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" it was n't exactly hard , but I got a little warm . A person will get warm in summer time . "
28024	28035	28037	28038	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" You do n't wear your coronet all the time ? "
28041	28044	28046	28047	the Earl	203	" No , "
28054	28062	28046	28047	the Earl	203	" it is not becoming to me . "
28063	28072	28074	28074	Cedric	39	" Mr. Hobbs said you always wore it , "
28076	28100	28074	28074	Cedric	39	" but after he thought it over , he said he supposed you must sometimes take it off to put your hat on . "
28101	28104	28106	28107	the Earl	203	" Yes , "
28109	28116	28106	28107	the Earl	203	" I take it off occasionally . "
28157	28167	28168	28168	he	39	" You must be very proud of your house , "
28171	28203	28168	28168	he	39	" it 's such a beautiful house . I never saw anything so beautiful ; but , of course , as I 'm only seven , I have n't seen much . "
28204	28218	28220	28221	the Earl	203	" And you think I must be proud of it , do you ? "
28223	28235	28220	28221	the Earl	203	" I should think any one would be proud of it , "
28240	28278	28280	28280	he	50	" I should be proud of it if it were my house . Everything about it is beautiful . And the park , and those trees , how beautiful they are , and how the leaves rustle ! "
28292	28311	28312	28312	he	50	" It 's a very big house for just two people to live in , is n't it ? "
28315	28324	28326	28327	the Earl	203	" It is quite large enough for two , "
28329	28337	28326	28327	the Earl	203	" Do you find it too large ? "
28345	28351	28352	28352	he	50	" I was only thinking , "
28355	28376	28352	28352	he	50	" that if two people lived in it who were not very good companions , they might feel lonely sometimes . "
28377	28388	28390	28391	the Earl	203	" Do you think I shall make a good companion ? "
28393	28396	28398	28398	Cedric	39	" Yes , "
28400	28424	28398	28398	Cedric	39	" I think you will . Mr. Hobbs and I were great friends . He was the best friend I had except Dearest . "
28436	28441	28432	28432	his	41	" Who is Dearest ? "
28442	28448	28450	28451	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" She is my mother , "
28535	28538	28542	28542	They	1038	" best friend "
28546	28550	28542	28542	They	1038	" best friends , "
28725	28728	28729	28729	he	41	" Fauntleroy , "
28734	28741	28729	28729	he	41	" what are you thinking of ? "
28753	28760	28761	28761	he	41	" I was thinking about Dearest , "
28764	28782	28761	28761	he	41	" and and I think I 'd better get up and walk up and down the room . "
28870	28878	28879	28879	he	50	" He 's a very nice dog , "
28882	28894	28879	28879	he	50	" He 's my friend . He knows how I feel . "
28895	28901	28903	28904	the Earl	203	" How do you feel ? "
28950	28954	28955	28955	he	203	" Come here , "
28963	28974	28976	28977	the boy	2518	" I never was away from my own house before , "
28988	29048	29049	29049	He	655	" It makes a person feel a strange feeling when he has to stay all night in another person 's castle instead of in his own house . But Dearest is not very far away from me . She told me to remember that and and I 'm seven and I can look at the picture she gave me . "
29068	29073	29074	29074	he	655	" This is it , "
29077	29095	29074	29074	he	655	" You see , you press this spring and it opens , and she is in there ! "
29144	29149	29150	29150	he	655	" There she is , "
29220	29232	29233	29233	he	655	" I suppose you think you are very fond of her , "
29236	29239	29233	29233	he	655	" Yes , "
29254	29338	29233	29233	he	655	" I do think so , and I think it 's true . You see , Mr. Hobbs was my friend , and Dick and Bridget and Mary and Michael , they were my friends , too ; but Dearest well , she is my CLOSE friend , and we always tell each other everything . My father left her to me to take care of , and when I am a man I am going to work and earn money for her . "
29339	29347	29349	29350	his grandfather	335	" What do you think of doing ? "
29385	29399	29400	29400	he	335	" I did think perhaps I might go into business with Mr. Hobbs , "
29403	29413	29400	29400	he	335	" but I should LIKE to be a President . "
29414	29426	29428	29429	his grandfather	335	" We 'll send you to the House of Lords instead , "
29431	29434	29436	29437	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" Well , "
29439	29467	29469	29469	he	335	" if I COULDN'T be a President , and if that is a good business , I should n't mind . The grocery business is dull sometimes . "
29692	29707	29710	29711	some one	307	" You will be careful , Dawson , not to say anything about it , "
29714	29738	29710	29711	some one	307	" He does not know why she is not to be with him , and the reason is to be kept from him . "
29739	29750	29710	29711	some one	307	" If them 's his lordship 's orders , mem , "
29755	30050	30051	30051	Cedric	39	" they 'll have to be kep ' , I suppose . But , if you 'll excuse the liberty , mem , as it 's between ourselves , servant or no servant , all I have to say is , it 's a cruel thing , parting that poor , pretty , young widdered cre'tur ' from her own flesh and blood , and him such a little beauty and a nobleman born . James and Thomas , mem , last night in the servants ' hall , they both of 'em say as they never see anythink in their two lives nor yet no other gentleman in livery like that little fellow 's ways , as innercent an ' polite an ' interested as if he 'd been sitting there dining with his best friend , and the temper of a ' angel , instead of one if you 'll excuse me , mem , as it 's well known , is enough to curdle your blood in your veins at times . And as to looks , mem , when we was rung for , James and me , to go into the library and bring him upstairs , and James lifted him up in his arms , what with his little innercent face all red and rosy , and his little head on James 's shoulder and his hair hanging down , all curly an ' shinin ' , a prettier , takiner sight you 'd never wish to see . An ' it 's my opinion , my lord was n't blind to it neither , for he looked at him , and he says to James , ' See you do n't wake him ! ' he says . "
30151	30159	30161	30162	Mrs. Mellon	72	" Good - morning , my lord , "
30164	30170	30161	30162	Mrs. Mellon	72	" Did you sleep well ? "
30179	30184	30185	30185	he	207	" Good - morning , "
30188	30197	30185	30185	he	207	" I did n't know I was here . "
30198	30208	30210	30211	the housekeeper	2809	" You were carried upstairs when you were asleep , "
30213	30232	30210	30211	the housekeeper	2809	" This is your bedroom , and this is Dawson , who is to take care of you . "
30256	30264	30265	30265	he	50	" How do you do , ma'am ? "
30268	30283	30265	30265	he	50	" I 'm much obliged to you for coming to take care of me . "
30284	30294	30296	30297	the housekeeper	2809	" You can call her Dawson , my lord , "
30302	30311	30296	30297	the housekeeper	2809	" She is used to being called Dawson . "
30312	30321	30323	30324	his lordship	207	" MISS Dawson , or MRS . Dawson ? "
30326	30333	30336	30336	herself	80	" Just Dawson , my lord , "
30342	30374	30336	30336	herself	80	" Neither Miss nor Missis , bless your little heart ! Will you get up now , and let Dawson dress you , and then have your breakfast in the nursery ? "
30375	30388	30390	30390	Fauntleroy	50	" I learned to dress myself many years ago , thank you , "
30392	30460	30390	30390	Fauntleroy	50	" Dearest taught me . ' Dearest ' is my mamma . We had only Mary to do all the work , washing and all , and so of course it would n't do to give her so much trouble . I can take my bath , too , pretty well if you 'll just be kind enough to ' zamine the corners after I 'm done . "
30468	30478	30480	30481	Mrs. Mellon	72	" Dawson will do anything you ask her to , "
30483	30491	30493	30493	Dawson	80	" That I will , bless him , "
30504	30528	30496	30496	her	2809	" He shall dress himself if he likes , and I 'll stand by , ready to help him if he wants me . "
30529	30533	30535	30536	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" Thank you , "
30538	30560	30561	30561	He	50	" it 's a little hard sometimes about the buttons , you know , and then I have to ask somebody . "
30728	30741	30743	30743	Dawson	80	" And she is a sort of relation of your lordship 's , "
30745	30754	30743	30743	Dawson	80	" And perhaps sometime you may see her . "
30755	30762	30764	30764	Fauntleroy	50	" Do you think I shall ? "
30766	30788	30764	30764	Fauntleroy	50	" I should like that . I never knew any little girls , but I always like to look at them . "
30862	30870	30871	30871	he	50	" I am a very little boy , "
30876	30898	30871	30871	he	50	" to live in such a large castle , and have so many big rooms , do n't you think so ? "
30899	30904	30906	30906	Dawson	80	" Oh ! come ! "
30908	30949	30871	30871	he	50	" you feel just a little strange at first , that 's all ; but you 'll get over that very soon , and then you 'll like it here . It 's such a beautiful place , you know . "
30950	30961	30963	30963	Fauntleroy	50	" It 's a very beautiful place , of course , "
30970	31023	30963	30963	Fauntleroy	50	" but I should like it better if I did n't miss Dearest so . I always had my breakfast with her in the morning , and put the sugar and cream in her tea for her , and handed her the toast . That made it very sociable , of course . "
31024	31029	31031	31031	Dawson	80	" Oh , well ! "
31035	31099	31031	31031	Dawson	80	" you know you can see her every day , and there 's no knowing how much you 'll have to tell her . Bless you ! wait till you 've walked about a bit and seen things , the dogs , and the stables with all the horses in them . There 's one of them I know you 'll like to see "
31100	31104	31106	31106	Fauntleroy	50	" Is there ? "
31108	31147	31106	31106	Fauntleroy	50	" I 'm very fond of horses . I was very fond of Jim . He was the horse that belonged to Mr. Hobbs ' grocery wagon . He was a beautiful horse when he was n't balky . "
31148	31151	31153	31153	Dawson	80	" Well , "
31155	31186	31153	31153	Dawson	80	" you just wait till you 've seen what 's in the stables . And , deary me , you have n't looked even into the very next room yet ! "
31187	31192	31194	31194	Fauntleroy	50	" What is there ? "
31196	31211	31213	31213	Dawson	80	" Wait until you 've had your breakfast , and then you shall see , "
31260	31265	31266	31266	he	1093	" Now , then , "
31278	31292	31266	31266	he	1093	" I 've had enough . Can I go and look at it ? "
31493	31502	31503	31503	he	1093	" It looks like a boy 's room , "
31514	31521	31503	31503	he	1093	" Whom do they belong to ? "
31522	31529	31531	31531	Dawson	80	" Go and look at them , "
31533	31539	31503	31503	he	1093	" They belong to you ! "
31540	31544	31545	31545	he	1093	" To me ! "
31548	31565	31545	31545	he	1093	" to me ? Why do they belong to me ? Who gave them to me ? "
31585	31590	31591	31591	he	1093	" It was Grandpapa ! "
31602	31609	31591	31591	he	1093	" I know it was Grandpapa ! "
31610	31618	31620	31620	Dawson	80	" Yes , it was his lordship , "
31622	31660	31620	31620	Dawson	80	" and if you will be a nice little gentleman , and not fret about things , and will enjoy yourself , and be happy all the day , he will give you anything you ask for . "
31757	31765	31766	31766	he	1093	" Did you ever know any one , "
31771	31779	31766	31766	he	1093	" who had such a kind grandfather ! "
31837	31864	31865	31867	the tallest footman	1113	" An ' of all the wicious , savage , hill - tempered hold fellows it was ever my hill - luck to wear livery hunder , "
31871	31883	31865	31867	the tallest footman	1113	" he 's the wiolentest and wust by a long shot . "
31921	31935	31936	31937	my lord	762	" Give him his own way , and fill his rooms with toys , "
31941	31982	31936	31937	my lord	762	" Give him what will amuse him , and he 'll forget about his mother quickly enough . Amuse him , and fill his mind with other things , and we shall have no trouble . That 's boy nature . "
32093	32104	32105	32105	he	50	" I was waiting for you to send for me , "
32108	32149	32105	32105	he	50	" I was ready a long time ago . I 'm EVER so much obliged to you for all those things ! I 'm EVER so much obliged to you ! I have been playing with them all the morning . "
32150	32153	32155	32156	the Earl	203	" Oh ! "
32158	32166	32155	32156	the Earl	203	" you like them , do you ? "
32167	32183	32185	32185	Fauntleroy	50	" I like them so much well , I could n't tell you how much ! "
32193	32281	32185	32185	Fauntleroy	50	" There 's one that 's like baseball , only you play it on a board with black and white pegs , and you keep your score with some counters on a wire . I tried to teach Dawson , but she could n't quite understand it just at first you see , she never played baseball , being a lady ; and I 'm afraid I was n't very good at explaining it to her . But you know all about it , do n't you ? "
32282	32290	32292	32293	the Earl	203	" I 'm afraid I do n't , "
32295	32312	32292	32293	the Earl	203	" It 's an American game , is n't it ? Is it something like cricket ? "
32313	32319	32321	32321	Fauntleroy	50	" I never saw cricket , "
32323	32385	32321	32321	Fauntleroy	50	" but Mr. Hobbs took me several times to see baseball . It 's a splendid game . You get so excited ! Would you like me to go and get my game and show it to you ? Perhaps it would amuse you and make you forget about your foot . Does your foot hurt you very much this morning ? "
32386	32392	32292	32293	the Earl	203	" More than I enjoy , "
32397	32406	32408	32410	the little fellow	655	" Then perhaps you could n't forget it , "
32413	32443	32408	32410	the little fellow	655	" Perhaps it would bother you to be told about the game . Do you think it would amuse you , or do you think it would bother you ? "
32444	32450	32452	32453	the Earl	203	" Go and get it , "
32524	32537	32538	32538	he	39	" May I pull that little table over here to your chair ? "
32541	32546	32548	32549	the Earl	41	" Ring for Thomas , "
32551	32559	32548	32549	the Earl	41	" He will place it for you . "
32560	32569	32571	32571	Fauntleroy	50	" Oh , I can do it myself , "
32573	32580	32571	32571	Fauntleroy	50	" It 's not very heavy . "
32581	32585	32587	32588	his grandfather	335	" Very well , "
32642	32652	32654	32654	Fauntleroy	50	" It 's very interesting when you once begin , "
32656	32720	32721	32721	He	960	" You see , the black pegs can be your side and the white ones mine . They 're men , you know , and once round the field is a home run and counts one and these are the outs and here is the first base and that 's the second and that 's the third and that 's the home base . "
32757	32760	32733	32733	He	960	" hot ball "
32861	32865	32866	32866	his	960	" home run , "
33480	33490	33492	33493	Mrs. Dibble	87	" And the way his lordship do go on ! "
33499	33574	33492	33493	Mrs. Dibble	87	" and the way he do use language , Mr. Thomas told Jane herself , no flesh and blood as is in livery could stand for throw a plate of toast at Mr. Thomas , hisself , he did , not more than two days since , and if it were n't for other things being agreeable and the society below stairs most genteel , warning would have been gave within a ' hour ! "
33929	33968	33970	33970	Thomas	79	" the hold man was wuss than usual a - thinkin ' hover the Capting 's boy , an ' hanticipatin ' as he wo n't be no credit to the fambly . An ' serve him right , "
33972	33998	33970	33970	Thomas	79	" hit 's ' is hown fault . Wot can he iggspect from a child brought up in pore circumstances in that there low Hamerica ? "
34121	34127	34095	34095	Judge	89	" That 's two out ! "
34136	34144	34095	34095	Judge	89	" You see it 's two out ! "
34207	34213	34214	34216	the little stranger	1229	" It 's two out ! "
34219	34231	34214	34216	the little stranger	1229	" You had n't any luck that time , had you ? "
34323	34326	34327	34327	he	203	" Ah ! "
34342	34359	34327	34327	he	203	" Good - morning , Mordaunt . I 've found a new employment , you see . "
34413	34421	34422	34422	he	203	" This is the new Lord Fauntleroy , "
34425	34439	34422	34422	he	203	" Fauntleroy , this is Mr. Mordaunt , the rector of the parish . "
34457	34469	34470	34470	he	203	" I am very glad to make your acquaintance , sir , "
34661	34673	34675	34676	the rector	1160	" I am delighted to make your acquaintance , Lord Fauntleroy , "
34678	34703	34675	34676	the rector	1160	" You made a long journey to come to us . A great many people will be glad to know you made it safely . "
34704	34711	34713	34713	Fauntleroy	50	" It WAS a long way , "
34715	34750	34713	34713	Fauntleroy	50	" but Dearest , my mother , was with me and I was n't lonely . Of course you are never lonely if your mother is with you ; and the ship was beautiful . "
34751	34758	34760	34761	the Earl	203	" Take a chair , Mordaunt , "
34776	34785	34786	34786	he	85	" Your lordship is greatly to be congratulated , "
34805	34812	34813	34813	he	203	" He is like his father , "
34818	34829	34813	34813	he	203	" Let us hope he 'll conduct himself more creditably . "
34835	34852	34832	34832	he	203	" Well , what is it this morning , Mordaunt ? Who is in trouble now ? "
34873	34878	34879	34879	he	203	" It is Higgins , "
34882	35013	34879	34879	he	203	" Higgins of Edge Farm . He has been very unfortunate . He was ill himself last autumn , and his children had scarlet fever . I ca n't say that he is a very good manager , but he has had ill - luck , and of course he is behindhand in many ways . He is in trouble about his rent now . Newick tells him if he does n't pay it , he must leave the place ; and of course that would be a very serious matter . His wife is ill , and he came to me yesterday to beg me to see about it , and ask you for time . He thinks if you would give him time he could catch up again . "
35014	35020	35022	35023	the Earl	203	" They all think that , "
35105	35114	35116	35117	the rector	1160	" Higgins is a well - meaning man , "
35127	35135	35137	35138	his lordship	207	" He is a bad enough tenant , "
35140	35151	35137	35138	his lordship	207	" And he is always behindhand , Newick tells me . "
35152	35160	35162	35163	the rector	1160	" He is in great trouble now , "
35165	35227	35162	35163	the rector	1160	" He is very fond of his wife and children , and if the farm is taken from him they may literally starve . He can not give them the nourishing things they need . Two of the children were left very low after the fever , and the doctor orders for them wine and luxuries that Higgins can not afford . "
35236	35244	35245	35245	he	50	" That was the way with Michael , "
35253	35258	35259	35259	he	203	" I forgot YOU ! "
35262	35277	35259	35259	he	203	" I forgot we had a philanthropist in the room . Who was Michael ? "
35296	35308	35310	35310	Fauntleroy	50	" He was Bridget 's husband , who had the fever , "
35312	35336	35310	35310	Fauntleroy	50	" and he could n't pay the rent or buy wine and things . And you gave me that money to help him . "
35363	35377	35378	35378	he	203	" I do n't know what sort of landed proprietor he will make , "
35381	35411	35378	35378	he	203	" I told Havisham the boy was to have what he wanted anything he wanted and what he wanted , it seems , was money to give to beggars . "
35412	35421	35423	35423	Fauntleroy	50	" Oh ! but they were n't beggars , "
35426	35437	35423	35423	Fauntleroy	50	" Michael was a splendid bricklayer ! They all worked . "
35438	35441	35443	35444	the Earl	203	" Oh ! "
35446	35465	35466	35466	He	203	" they were not beggars . They were splendid bricklayers , and bootblacks , and apple - women . "
35513	35517	35518	35518	he	203	" Come here , "
35541	35550	35551	35552	his lordship	207	" What would YOU do in this case ? "
35717	35728	35730	35731	the Earl	203	" And what would YOU do in such a case ? "
35756	35763	35764	35764	he	50	" If I were very rich , "
35767	35800	35764	35764	he	50	" and not only just a little boy , I should let him stay , and give him the things for his children ; but then , I am only a boy . "
35816	35826	35827	35827	he	50	" YOU can do anything , ca n't you ? "
35830	35833	35835	35836	my lord	762	" Humph ! "
35842	35851	35835	35836	my lord	762	" That 's your opinion , is it ? "
35859	35869	35871	35871	Fauntleroy	50	" I mean you can give any one anything , "
35873	35878	35871	35871	Fauntleroy	50	" Who 's Newick ? "
35879	35885	35887	35888	the Earl	203	" He is my agent , "
35890	35904	35887	35888	the Earl	203	" and some of my tenants are not over - fond of him . "
35905	35916	35918	35918	Fauntleroy	50	" Are you going to write him a letter now ? "
35920	35939	35918	35918	Fauntleroy	50	" Shall I bring you the pen and ink ? I can take the game off this table . "
35971	35976	35977	35977	he	203	" Can you write ? "
35980	35983	35985	35985	Cedric	39	" Yes , "
35987	35993	35985	35985	Cedric	39	" but not very well . "
35994	36002	36004	36005	my lord	762	" Move the things from the table , "
36007	36024	36025	36026	Mr. Mordaunt	85	" and bring the pen and ink , and a sheet of paper from my desk . "
36062	36065	36066	36066	he	50	" There ! "
36070	36077	36066	36066	he	50	" now you can write it . "
36078	36085	36087	36088	the Earl	203	" You are to write it , "
36090	36093	36095	36095	Fauntleroy	50	" I ! "
36104	36132	36095	36095	Fauntleroy	50	" Will it do if I write it ? I do n't always spell quite right when I have n't a dictionary , and nobody tells me . "
36133	36138	36140	36141	the Earl	203	" It will do , "
36143	36168	36140	36141	the Earl	203	" Higgins will not complain of the spelling . I 'm not the philanthropist ; you are . Dip your pen in the ink . "
36195	36198	36199	36199	he	50	" Now , "
36202	36208	36199	36199	he	50	" what must I say ? "
36209	36236	36238	36239	the Earl	41	" You may say , ' Higgins is not to be interfered with , for the present , ' and sign it , ' Fauntleroy , ' "
36303	36311	36312	36312	he	50	" Do you think it will do ? "
36331	36334	36335	36335	he	203	" Yes , "
36338	36346	36335	36335	he	203	" Higgins will find it entirely satisfactory . "
36363	36390	36391	36391	FAUNTLEROY	50	" Dear mr . Newik if you pleas mr . higins is not to be intur feared with for the present and oblige . Yours rispecferly , "
36393	36394	36391	36391	FAUNTLEROY	50	" "
36404	36408	36395	36396	Mr. Hobbs	46	" said Fauntleroy ; "
36432	36433	36391	36391	FAUNTLEROY	50	" "
36447	36452	36453	36453	I	0	" answered the Earl . "
36459	36463	36453	36453	I	0	" said Fauntleroy . "
36505	36534	36498	36498	I	0	" And write it over again he did , making quite an imposing copy , and taking precautions in the matter of spelling by consulting the Earl himself . "
36541	36545	36498	36498	I	0	" he said . "
36615	36690	36587	36587	you	1283	" When Mr. Mordaunt went away , he took the letter with him , and he took something else with him also namely , a pleasanter feeling and a more hopeful one than he had ever carried home with him down that avenue on any previous visit he had made at Dorincourt Castle . When he was gone , Fauntleroy , who had accompanied him to the door , went back to his grandfather . "
36698	36702	36692	36692	I	0	" he asked . "
36712	36720	36705	36705	she	1284	" The Earl was silent a moment . "
36733	36737	36705	36705	she	1284	" he said . "
36742	36743	36705	36705	she	1284	" "
36748	36758	36745	36745	you	0	" said Fauntleroy , with his quick little flush . "
36786	36787	36777	36777	She	1284	" "
36791	36796	36777	36777	She	1284	" answered the Earl . "
36803	36809	36797	36797	We	1286	" Then he added dryly , "
36815	36822	36823	36824	A pony	1288	" Fauntleroy drew a long breath . "
36826	36830	36823	36824	A pony	1288	" he exclaimed . "
36836	36837	36838	36838	Yours	1289	" "
36840	36845	36846	36846	Mine	1289	" replied the Earl . "
36848	36854	36855	36855	Mine	1289	" cried the little fellow . "
36861	36862	36855	36855	Mine	1289	" "
36865	36870	36855	36855	Mine	1289	" said his grandfather . "
36887	36896	36879	36879	I	0	" Fauntleroy 's cheeks grew redder and redder . "
36906	36910	36897	36897	I	0	" he said . "
36931	36932	36922	36922	You	0	" "
36940	36951	36934	36934	you	1289	" inquired the Earl . Fauntleroy drew a long breath . "
36958	36962	36952	36952	I	0	" he said . "
36984	36985	36976	36976	I	0	" "
36996	37001	37002	37002	You	1289	" asked the Earl . "
37011	37012	37004	37004	you	1289	" "
37015	37038	37004	37004	you	1289	" said Fauntleroy , ' she has been thinking about me all the morning , and I have been thinking about her ! "
37039	37042	37044	37045	the Earl	203	" Oh ! "
37047	37058	37044	37045	the Earl	203	" You have , have you ? Ring the bell . "
37128	37135	37136	37136	he	203	" Dearest will be so glad ! "
37140	37208	37209	37209	He	203	" She will be so much obliged to you for being so kind to me ! She knows I always liked ponies so much , but we never thought I should have one . There was a little boy on Fifth Avenue who had one , and he used to ride out every morning and we used to take a walk past his house to see him . "
37231	37244	37245	37245	he	203	" I think you must be the best person in the world , "
37251	37303	37245	37245	he	203	" You are always doing good , are n't you ? and thinking about other people . Dearest says that is the best kind of goodness ; not to think about yourself , but to think about other people . That is just the way you are , is n't it ? "
37382	37390	37391	37391	he	203	" You make so many people happy , "
37394	37492	37391	37391	he	203	" There 's Michael and Bridget and their ten children , and the apple - woman , and Dick , and Mr. Hobbs , and Mr. Higgins and Mrs. Higgins and their children , and Mr. Mordaunt , because of course he was glad , and Dearest and me , about the pony and all the other things . Do you know , I 've counted it up on my fingers and in my mind , and it 's twenty - seven people you 've been kind to . That 's a good many twenty - seven ! "
37493	37507	37509	37510	the Earl	203	" And I was the person who was kind to them was I ? "

37574	37584	37586	37587	his lordship	207	" What was Mr. Hobbs 's opinion of earls ? "
37589	37599	37601	37603	his young companion	961	" Well , you see , the difficulty was , "
37605	37673	37601	37603	his young companion	961	" that he did n't know any , and he 'd only read about them in books . He thought you must n't mind it that they were gory tyrants ; and he said he would n't have them hanging around his store . But if he 'd known YOU , I 'm sure he would have felt quite different . I shall tell him about you . "

An ' the Earl so took aback , Mr. Thomas says , that he could n't do nothing but listen and stare from under his eyebrows . An ' it 's Mr. Thomas 's opinion , Mrs. Bates , mum , that bad as he is , he was pleased in his secret soul , an ' proud , too ; for a handsomer little fellow , or with better manners , though so old - fashioned , Mr. Thomas says he 'd never wish to see .

And that is best of all , Ceddie , it is better than everything else , that the world should be a little better because a man has lived even ever so little better , dearest . "

And when we come to the cottage , an ' the boy 's mother come out all in a taking to see what 's up , he whips off his cap an ' ses he , ' I 've brought your son home , ma'am , ' ses he , ' because his leg hurt him , and I do n't think that stick is enough for him to lean on ; and I 'm going to ask my grandfather to have a pair of crutches made for him .

46736	46741	46733	46734	the Earl	203	" I am thinking , "
46745	46761	46733	46734	the Earl	203	" what a little boy I am ! and of what Dearest said to me . "
46762	46767	46769	46770	the Earl	203	" What was it ? "
46772	46936	46769	46770	the Earl	203	" She said that perhaps it was not so easy to be very rich ; that if any one had so many things always , one might sometimes forget that every one else was not so fortunate , and that one who is rich should always be careful and try to remember . I was talking to her about how good you were , and she said that was such a good thing , because an earl had so much power , and if he cared only about his own pleasure and never thought about the people who lived on his lands , they might have trouble that he could help and there were so many people , and it would be such a hard thing . And I was just looking at all those houses , and thinking how I should have to find out about the people , when I was an earl . How did you find out about them ? "
46973	46980	46981	46981	he	1699	" Newick finds out for me , "
47001	47008	47009	47009	he	1699	" We will go home now , "
47012	47034	47009	47009	he	1699	" and when you are an earl , see to it that you are a better earl than I have been ! "
47161	47180	47181	47181	he	1699	" I 'm an old fellow in my dotage , and I have nothing else to think of , "
47347	47356	47357	47357	he	1699	" Does Newick know all about the people ? "
47360	47370	47372	47373	his lordship	207	" It is his business to know about them , "
47375	47382	47372	47373	his lordship	207	" Been neglecting it has he ? "
47459	47465	47467	47467	Fauntleroy	50	" There is a place , "
47482	47609	47467	47467	Fauntleroy	50	" Dearest has seen it ; it is at the other end of the village . The houses are close together , and almost falling down ; you can scarcely breathe ; and the people are so poor , and everything is dreadful ! Often they have fever , and the children die ; and it makes them wicked to live like that , and be so poor and miserable ! It is worse than Michael and Bridget ! The rain comes in at the roof ! Dearest went to see a poor woman who lived there . She would not let me come near her until she had changed all her things . The tears ran down her cheeks when she told me about it ! "
47625	47640	47641	47641	he	1716	" I told her you did n't know , and I would tell you , "
47657	47665	47666	47666	he	1716	" You can make it all right , "
47669	47705	47666	47666	he	1716	" just as you made it all right for Higgins . You always make it all right for everybody . I told her you would , and that Newick must have forgotten to tell you . "
47907	47910	47911	47911	he	91	" What ! "
47914	47930	47911	47911	he	91	" you want to make a builder of model cottages of me , do you ? "
47946	47953	47955	47955	Fauntleroy	50	" Those must be pulled down , "
47961	48001	48003	48003	his	91	" Dearest says so . Let us let us go and have them pulled down to - morrow . The people will be so glad when they see you ! They 'll know you have come to help them ! "
48029	48042	48043	48043	he	203	" Let us go out and take our walk on the terrace , "
48051	48059	48043	48043	he	203	" and we can talk it over . "
48482	48490	48491	48491	she	43	" The Earl would give him anything , "
48497	48531	48491	48491	she	43	" He would indulge his every whim . Why should not that indulgence be used for the good of others ? It is for me to see that this shall come to pass . "
48713	48746	48696	48696	he	39	" I am a violent , selfish old rascal ; I never did a generous thing in my life , and I do n't care about Earl 's Court or the poor people "
48846	48856	48857	48857	he	39	" It is Lord Fauntleroy who insists on it , "
48861	48881	48857	48857	he	39	" he thinks it will improve the property . You can tell the tenants that it 's his idea . "
49192	49200	49201	49201	he	545	" They are so fond of you , "
49215	49250	49201	49201	he	545	" Do you see how glad they are when they see you ? I hope they will some day be as fond of me . It must be nice to have EVERYbody like you . "
49359	49370	49371	49371	he	545	" I always like to know about things like those , "
49374	49385	49371	49371	he	545	" because you never know what you are coming to . "
49450	49457	49458	49458	they	1793	" He 's a rare un , "
49463	49485	49458	49458	they	1793	" An ' a noice little outspoken chap , too . Not much o ' th ' bad stock in him . "
49536	49539	49531	49532	every one	184	" wicked Earl "
49698	49705	49706	49706	he	960	" The boy can do anything , "
49712	49715	49706	49706	he	960	" anything ! "
49797	49802	49803	49803	Cedric	39	" Do you remember , "
49819	49854	49803	49803	Cedric	39	" do you remember what I said to you that first night about our being good companions ? I do n't think any people could be better companions than we are , do you ? "
49855	49866	49868	49869	his lordship	207	" We are pretty good companions , I should say , "
49871	49875	49868	49869	his lordship	207	" Come here . "
49884	49891	49892	49893	the Earl	203	" Is there anything you want , "
49896	49902	49892	49893	the Earl	203	" anything you have not ? "
49920	49925	49926	49926	he	335	" Only one thing , "
49929	49934	49936	49937	the Earl	203	" What is that ? "
49958	49963	49964	49965	my lord	762	" What is it ? "
49971	49976	49977	49977	he	50	" It is Dearest , "
49987	49996	49997	49997	he	41	" But you see her almost every day , "
50000	50006	49997	49997	he	41	" Is not that enough ? "
50007	50017	50019	50019	Fauntleroy	50	" I used to see her all the time , "
50021	50054	50019	50019	Fauntleroy	50	" She used to kiss me when I went to sleep at night , and in the morning she was always there , and we could tell each other things without waiting . "
50079	50088	50089	50089	he	203	" Do you NEVER forget about your mother ? "
50092	50095	50089	50089	he	203	" No , "
50099	50136	50097	50097	Fauntleroy	50	" never ; and she never forgets about me . I should n't forget about YOU , you know , if I did n't live with you . I should think about you all the more . "
50137	50142	50144	50145	the Earl	203	" Upon my word , "
50155	50161	50144	50145	the Earl	203	" I believe you would ! "
50800	50810	50811	50811	she	116	" Probably to be ruined as the others were , "
50817	50840	50811	50811	she	116	" unless his mother is good enough and has a will of her own to help her to take care of him . "
50862	50869	50870	50870	she	116	" It is disgraceful , Harry ! "
50873	50925	50870	50870	she	116	" Fancy a child of that age being taken from his mother , and made the companion of a man like my brother ! He will either be brutal to the boy or indulge him until he is a little monster . If I thought it would do any good to write "
50926	50933	50935	50936	Sir Harry	115	" It would n't , Constantia , "
50938	50945	50946	50946	she	116	" I know it would n't , "
50949	50966	50946	50946	she	116	" I know his lordship the Earl of Dorincourt too well ; but it is outrageous . "
51145	51153	51154	51154	he	203	" And , d ' ye know , "
51165	51215	51158	51158	he	203	" the old man looked as proud as a turkey - cock ; and upon my word I do n't wonder , for a handsomer , finer lad than his grandson I never saw ! As straight as a dart , and sat his pony like a young trooper ! "
51300	51305	51306	51306	she	1887	" It seems incredible ! "
51309	51367	51306	51306	she	1887	" I have heard it said that the child has worked miracles , and I begin to believe it . They say my brother adores the boy and can scarcely endure to have him out of sight . And he is so proud of him ! Actually , I believe he wants to show him to us . "
51511	51516	51517	51517	she	1887	" What , Molyneux ! "
51520	51526	51517	51517	she	1887	" is this the child ? "
51527	51532	51534	51535	the Earl	203	" Yes , Constantia , "
51537	51555	51534	51535	the Earl	203	" this is the boy . Fauntleroy , this is your grand - aunt , Lady Lorridaile . "
51556	51566	51568	51568	Fauntleroy	50	" How do you do , Grand - Aunt ? "
51595	51602	51603	51603	she	116	" I am your Aunt Constantia , "
51606	51621	51603	51603	she	116	" and I loved your poor papa , and you are very like him . "
51622	51636	51638	51638	Fauntleroy	50	" It makes me glad when I am told I am like him , "
51640	51659	51638	51638	Fauntleroy	50	" because it seems as if every one liked him , just like Dearest , eszackly , Aunt Constantia "
51691	51696	51697	51697	she	116	" Well , Molyneux , "
51705	51715	51697	51697	she	116	" it could not possibly be better than this ! "
51716	51721	51723	51724	his lordship	207	" I think not , "
51727	51790	51723	51724	his lordship	207	" He is a fine little fellow . We are great friends . He believes me to be the most charming and sweet - tempered of philanthropists . I will confess to you , Constantia , as you would find it out if I did not , that I am in some slight danger of becoming rather an old fool about him . "
51791	51800	51806	51806	her	116	" What does his mother think of you ? "
51810	51817	51819	51820	the Earl	203	" I have not asked her , "
51825	51828	51830	51831	Lady Lorridaile	116	" Well , "
51833	51923	51830	51831	Lady Lorridaile	116	" I will be frank with you at the outset , Molyneux , and tell you I do n't approve of your course , and that it is my intention to call on Mrs. Errol as soon as possible ; so if you wish to quarrel with me , you had better mention it at once . What I hear of the young creature makes me quite sure that her child owes her everything . We were told even at Lorridaile Park that your poorer tenants adore her already . "
51924	51929	51931	51932	the Earl	203	" They adore HIM , "
51938	52005	52007	52007	he	50	" As to Mrs. Errol , you 'll find her a pretty little woman . I 'm rather in debt to her for giving some of her beauty to the boy , and you can go to see her if you like . All I ask is that she will remain at Court Lodge and that you will not ask me to go and see her , "
52013	52034	52007	52007	he	50	" But he does n't hate her as much as he used to , that is plain enough to me , "
52043	52125	52035	52036	her ladyship	1909	" And he is a changed man in a measure , and , incredible as it may seem , Harry , it is my opinion that he is being made into a human being , through nothing more nor less than his affection for that innocent , affectionate little fellow . Why , the child actually loves him leans on his chair and against his knee . His own children would as soon have thought of nestling up to a tiger . "
52148	52217	52142	52142	she	1908	" Molyneux , she is the loveliest little woman I ever saw ! She has a voice like a silver bell , and you may thank her for making the boy what he is . She has given him more than her beauty , and you make a great mistake in not persuading her to come and take charge of you . I shall invite her to Lorridaile . "
52218	52226	52228	52229	the Earl	203	" She 'll not leave the boy , "
52231	52239	52241	52242	Lady Lorridaile	116	" I must have the boy too , "
52374	52386	52387	52387	she	116	" Bevis and Maurice were such a bitter humiliation to him , "
52393	52411	52387	52387	she	116	" Every one knew it . He actually hated them . His pride has full sway here . "
52450	52457	52459	52460	the Earl	203	" The lad has good manners , "
52462	52507	52459	52460	the Earl	203	" He will be in no one 's way . Children are usually idiots or bores , mine were both , but he can actually answer when he 's spoken to , and be silent when he is not . He is never offensive . "
52686	52826	52669	52669	them	184	" ; and she was so charming that he could not keep his eyes from her . She was a rather tall young lady with a proud little head , and very soft dark hair , and large eyes the color of purple pansies , and the color on her cheeks and lips was like that of a rose . She was dressed in a beautiful white dress , and had pearls around her throat . There was one strange thing about this young lady . So many gentlemen stood near her , and seemed anxious to please her , that Fauntleroy thought she must be something like a princess . He was so much interested in her that without knowing it he drew nearer and nearer to her , and at last she turned and spoke to him . "
52833	52839	52830	52831	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" she said , smiling ; "
52850	52851	52852	52852	I	0	" "
52860	52891	52852	52852	I	0	" his young lordship replied . Then all the gentlemen laughed outright , and the young lady laughed a little too , and the rose color in her cheeks brightened . "
52896	52908	52894	52894	Fauntleroy	50	" said one of the gentlemen who had laughed most heartily , "
52930	52931	52920	52920	you	50	" "
52939	52944	52933	52933	nobody	2417	" said Fauntleroy sweetly . "
52960	52961	52952	52952	YOU	1936	" "
52972	53015	52962	52962	We	1938	" said the gentleman , while the rest laughed more than ever . But the beautiful young lady her name was Miss Vivian Herbert put out her hand and drew Cedric to her side , looking prettier than before , if possible . "
53024	53028	53021	53021	he	50	" she said ; "
53046	53055	53040	53040	he	50	" And she kissed him on his cheek . "
53068	53081	53058	53058	you	0	" said Fauntleroy , looking at her with innocent , admiring eyes , "
53111	53112	53116	53116	she	48	" "
53119	53210	53116	53116	she	48	" said Miss Vivian Herbert . And she laughed and kissed his cheek again . She kept him by her side a great part of the evening , and the group of which they were the center was very gay . He did not know how it happened , but before long he was telling them all about America , and the Republican Rally , and Mr. Hobbs and Dick , and in the end he proudly produced from his pocket Dick 's parting gift , the red silk handkerchief . "
53226	53230	53231	53231	I	0	" he said . "
53244	53277	53233	53233	Dick	59	" And queer as the big , flaming , spotted thing was , there was a serious , affectionate look in his eyes , which prevented his audience from laughing very much . "
53285	53289	53281	53281	I	0	" he said , "
53296	53558	53291	53291	Dick	59	" But though he was talked to so much , as the Earl had said , he was in no one 's way . He could be quiet and listen when others talked , and so no one found him tiresome . A slight smile crossed more than one face when several times he went and stood near his grandfather 's chair , or sat on a stool close to him , watching him and absorbing every word he uttered with the most charmed interest . Once he stood so near the chair 's arm that his cheek touched the Earl 's shoulder , and his lordship , detecting the general smile , smiled a little himself . He knew what the lookers - on were thinking , and he felt some secret amusement in their seeing what good friends he was with this youngster , who might have been expected to share the popular opinion of him . Mr. Havisham had been expected to arrive in the afternoon , but , strange to say , he was late . Such a thing had really never been known to happen before during all the years in which he had been a visitor at Dorincourt Castle . He was so late that the guests were on the point of rising to go in to dinner when he arrived . When he approached his host , the Earl regarded him with amazement . He looked as if he had been hurried or agitated ; his dry , keen old face was actually pale . "
53563	53575	53559	53559	I	0	" he said , in a low voice to the Earl , "
53581	53928	53929	53929	I	0	" It was as unlike the methodic old lawyer to be agitated by anything as it was to be late , but it was evident that he had been disturbed . At dinner he ate scarcely anything , and two or three times , when he was spoken to , he started as if his thoughts were far away . At dessert , when Fauntleroy came in , he looked at him more than once , nervously and uneasily . Fauntleroy noted the look and wondered at it . He and Mr. Havisham were on friendly terms , and they usually exchanged smiles . The lawyer seemed to have forgotten to smile that evening . The fact was , he forgot everything but the strange and painful news he knew he must tell the Earl before the night was over the strange news which he knew would be so terrible a shock , and which would change the face of everything . As he looked about at the splendid rooms and the brilliant company , at the people gathered together , he knew , more that they might see the bright - haired little fellow near the Earl 's chair than for any other reason , as he looked at the proud old man and at little Lord Fauntleroy smiling at his side , he really felt quite shaken , notwithstanding that he was a hardened old lawyer . What a blow it was that he must deal them ! He did not exactly know how the long , superb dinner ended . He sat through it as if he were in a dream , and several times he saw the Earl glance at him in surprise . But it was over at last , and the gentlemen joined the ladies in the drawing - room . They found Fauntleroy sitting on the sofa with Miss Vivian Herbert , the great beauty of the last London season ; they had been looking at some pictures , and he was thanking his companion as the door opened . "
53944	53949	53936	53936	you	1944	" he was saying ; "
53966	54130	53959	53959	I	0	" He had enjoyed himself so much that when the gentlemen gathered about Miss Herbert again and began to talk to her , as he listened and tried to understand their laughing speeches , his eyelids began to droop . They drooped until they covered his eyes two or three times , and then the sound of Miss Herbert 's low , pretty laugh would bring him back , and he would open them again for about two seconds . He was quite sure he was not going to sleep , but there was a large , yellow satin cushion behind him and his head sank against it , and after a while his eyelids drooped for the last time . They did not even quite open when , as it seemed a long time after , some one kissed him lightly on the cheek . It was Miss Vivian Herbert , who was going away , and she spoke to him softly . "
54139	54143	54135	54137	little Lord Fauntleroy	50	" she said . "
54147	54169	53959	53959	I	0	" And in the morning he did not know that he had tried to open his eyes and had murmured sleepily , "
54184	54336	54180	54180	you	50	" He only had a very faint recollection of hearing the gentlemen laugh again and of wondering why they did it . No sooner had the last guest left the room , than Mr. Havisham turned from his place by the fire , and stepped nearer the sofa , where he stood looking down at the sleeping occupant . Little Lord Fauntleroy was taking his ease luxuriously . One leg crossed the other and swung over the edge of the sofa ; one arm was flung easily above his head ; the warm flush of healthful , happy , childish sleep was on his quiet face ; his waving tangle of bright hair strayed over the yellow satin cushion . He made a picture well worth looking at . As Mr. Havisham looked at it , he put his hand up and rubbed his shaven chin , with a harassed countenance . "
54341	54351	54339	54339	Havisham	51	" said the Earl 's harsh voice behind him . "
54374	54387	54339	54339	Havisham	51	" Mr. Havisham turned from the sofa , still rubbing his chin . "
54393	54397	54339	54339	Havisham	51	" he answered , "
54418	54450	54413	54416	the bearer of it	1946	" The Earl had been uneasy for some time during the evening , as he glanced at Mr. Havisham , and when he was uneasy he was always ill - tempered . "
54460	54465	54453	54453	you	51	" he exclaimed irritably . "
54513	54514	54515	54516	My lord	762	" "
54518	54523	54515	54516	My lord	762	" said Mr. Havisham , "
54592	54630	54572	54590	the son of your son Bevis , and is at this moment in a lodging - house in London	1952	" The Earl clutched the arms of his chair with both his hands until the veins stood out upon them ; the veins stood out on his forehead too ; his fierce old face was almost livid . "
54636	54641	54633	54633	you	51	" he cried out . "
54651	54652	54681	54681	She	2499	" "
54659	54664	54681	54681	She	2499	" answered Mr. Havisham , "
54790	54919	54778	54778	she	2499	" There was a movement of the curly head on the yellow satin cushion . A soft , long , sleepy sigh came from the parted lips , and the little boy stirred in his sleep , but not at all restlessly or uneasily . Not at all as if his slumber were disturbed by the fact that he was being proved a small impostor and that he was not Lord Fauntleroy at all and never would be the Earl of Dorincourt . He only turned his rosy face more on its side , as if to enable the old man who stared at it so solemnly to see it better . The handsome , grim old face was ghastly . A bitter smile fixed itself upon it . "
54930	54934	54778	54778	she	2499	" he said , "
55010	55011	55007	55007	you	0	" "
55026	55031	55018	55018	she	816	" answered the lawyer . "
55058	55115	55048	55048	She	816	" The fastidious old lawyer ceased speaking and gave a sort of shudder . The veins on the old Earl 's forehead stood out like purple cords . Something else stood out upon it too cold drops of moisture . He took out his handkerchief and swept them away . His smile grew even more bitter . "
55119	55123	55124	55124	I	0	" he said , "
55137	55147	55148	55148	I	0	" pointing to the sleeping form on the sofa ; "
55169	55261	55262	55262	I	0	" Suddenly he sprang up from his chair and began to walk up and down the room . Fierce and terrible words poured forth from his lips . His rage and hatred and cruel disappointment shook him as a storm shakes a tree . His violence was something dreadful to see , and yet Mr. Havisham noticed that at the very worst of his wrath he never seemed to forget the little sleeping figure on the yellow satin cushion , and that he never once spoke loud enough to awaken it . "
55268	55272	55262	55262	I	0	" he said . "
55330	55445	55328	55328	him	117	" And then he raged again and asked questions about the woman , about her proofs , and pacing the room , turned first white and then purple in his repressed fury . When at last he had learned all there was to be told , and knew the worst , Mr. Havisham looked at him with a feeling of anxiety . He looked broken and haggard and changed . His rages had always been bad for him , but this one had been worse than the rest because there had been something more than rage in it . He came slowly back to the sofa , at last , and stood near it . "
55460	55471	55447	55448	any one	233	" he said , his harsh voice low and unsteady , "
55502	55508	55497	55497	he	1982	" with a bitter smile . "
55563	55635	55553	55553	He	1982	" He bent down and stood a minute or so looking at the happy , sleeping face . His shaggy eyebrows were knitted fiercely , and yet somehow he did not seem fierce at all . He put up his hand , pushed the bright hair back from the forehead , and then turned away and rang the bell . When the largest footman appeared , he pointed to the sofa . "
55637	55648	55553	55553	He	1982	" he said , and then his voice changed a little "
55656	55656	55650	55651	Lord Fauntleroy	50	"
55992	56007	55987	55987	his	1995	" Hello , Mr. Hobbs ! This is a hot day is n't it ? "
56157	56178	56145	56145	his	46	" From his oldest friend , Lord Fauntleroy , to Mr. Hobbs . When this you see , remember me . "

56543	56550	56540	56540	he	46	" Want a shine , sir ? "
56565	56568	56569	56569	he	2005	" Yes , "
56595	56602	56603	56603	he	2005	" Where did you get that ? "
56606	56614	56616	56616	Dick	59	" From a friend o ' mine , "
56618	56656	56616	56616	Dick	59	" a little feller . He guv ' me the whole outfit . He was the best little feller ye ever saw . He 's in England now . Gone to be one o ' them lords . "
56657	56660	56662	56663	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Lord Lord "
56669	56679	56662	56663	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Lord Fauntleroy Goin' to be Earl of Dorincourt ? "
56686	56691	56692	56692	he	59	" Why , boss ! "
56695	56703	56692	56692	he	59	" d ' ye know him yerself ? "
56704	56710	56712	56713	Mr. Hobbs	46	" I 've known him , "
56720	56737	56712	56713	Mr. Hobbs	46	" ever since he was born . We was lifetime acquaintances that 's what WE was . "
56774	56785	56786	56786	he	46	" ' When this you see , remember me , ' "
56789	56819	56820	56820	he	46	" That was his parting keepsake to me . ' I do n't want you to forget me ' those was his words I 'd ha ' remembered him , "
56828	56860	56820	56820	he	46	" if he had n't given me a thing an ' I had n't seen hide nor hair on him again . He was a companion as ANY man would remember . "
56861	56872	56874	56874	Dick	59	" He was the nicest little feller I ever see , "
56876	57030	56820	56820	he	46	" An ' as to sand I never seen so much sand to a little feller . I thought a heap o ' him , I did , an ' we was friends , too we was sort o ' chums from the fust , that little young un an ' me . I grabbed his ball from under a stage fur him , an ' he never forgot it ; an ' he 'd come down here , he would , with his mother or his nuss and he 'd holler : ' Hello , Dick ! ' at me , as friendly as if he was six feet high , when he warn't knee high to a grasshopper , and was dressed in gal 's clo'es . He was a gay little chap , and when you was down on your luck , it did you good to talk to him . "
57031	57036	57038	57039	Mr. Hobbs	46	" That 's so , "
57041	57072	57038	57039	Mr. Hobbs	46	" It was a pity to make a earl out of HIM . He would have SHONE in the grocery business or dry goods either ; he would have SHONE ! "
57255	57265	57266	57267	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Do you know anything about earls and castles ? "
57270	57281	57266	57267	Mr. Hobbs	46	" I 'd like to know more of the particklars . "
57282	57297	57299	57299	Dick	59	" There 's a story about some on 'em in the Penny Story Gazette , "
57301	57340	57299	57299	Dick	59	" It 's called the ' Crime of a Coronet ; or , The Revenge of the Countess May. ' It 's a boss thing , too . Some of us boys 're takin ' it to read . "
57341	57349	57351	57352	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Bring it up when you come , "
57354	57424	57351	57352	Mr. Hobbs	46	" an ' I 'll pay for it . Bring all you can find that have any earls in 'em . If there are n't earls , markises'll do , or dooks though HE never made mention of any dooks or markises . We did go over coronets a little , but I never happened to see any . I guess they do n't keep 'em ' round here . "
57425	57434	57436	57436	Dick	59	" Tiffany 'd have 'em if anybody did , "
57438	57454	57436	57436	Dick	59	" but I do n't know as I 'd know one if I saw it . "
57479	57490	57491	57491	he	46	" I s'pose there is very little call for 'em , "
57568	57572	57550	57550	he	46	" Help yerself . "
57626	57633	57634	57634	he	46	" There 's his very kicks , "
57638	57751	57634	57634	he	46	" his very kicks . I sit and look at 'em by the hour . This is a world of ups an ' it 's a world of downs . Why , he 'd set there , an ' eat crackers out of a box , an ' apples out of a barrel , an ' pitch his cores into the street ; an ' now he 's a lord a - livin ' in a castle . Them 's a lord 's kicks ; they 'll be a earl 's kicks some day . Sometimes I says to myself , says I , ' Well , I 'll be jiggered ! ' "
57823	57829	57830	57830	he	46	" Here 's to HIM ! "
57837	57857	57830	57830	he	46	" an ' may he teach 'em a lesson earls an ' markises an ' dooks an ' all ! "
57957	57961	57962	57962	he	46	" I want , "
57965	57971	57962	57962	he	46	" a book about earls . "
57972	57975	57977	57978	the clerk	2032	" What ! "
57980	57984	57986	57989	the grocery - man	1986	" A book , "
57991	57995	57986	57989	the grocery - man	1986	" about earls . "
57996	58001	58003	58004	the clerk	2032	" I 'm afraid , "
58010	58019	58003	58004	the clerk	2032	" that we have n't what you want . "
58020	58024	58026	58027	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Have n't ? "
58031	58040	58026	58027	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Well , say markises then or dooks . "
58041	58049	58051	58052	the clerk	2032	" I know of no such book , "
58072	58078	58079	58079	he	46	" None about female earls ? "
58082	58088	58090	58091	the clerk	2032	" I 'm afraid not , "
58096	58099	58101	58102	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Well , "
58104	58110	58101	58102	Mr. Hobbs	46	" I 'll be jiggered ! "
58167	58173	58160	58161	the clerk	2032	" The Tower of London , "
58297	58305	58306	58306	he	46	" Why , he ai n't safe ! "
58309	58375	58306	58306	he	46	" He ai n't safe ! If the women folks can sit up on their thrones an ' give the word for things like that to be done , who 's to know what 's happening to him this very minute ? He 's no more safe than nothing ! Just let a woman like that get mad , an ' no one 's safe ! "
58376	58379	58381	58381	Dick	59	" Well , "
58390	58429	58381	58381	Dick	59	" ye see this ' ere un is n't the one that 's bossin ' things now . I know her name 's Victory , an ' this un here in the book , her name 's Mary . "
58430	58435	58437	58438	Mr. Hobbs	46	" So it is , "
58509	58800	58496	58496	they	2049	" He was privately uneasy for several days ; and it was not until he received Fauntleroy 's letter and had read it several times , both to himself and to Dick , and had also read the letter Dick got about the same time , that he became composed again . But they both found great pleasure in their letters . They read and re - read them , and talked them over and enjoyed every word of them . And they spent days over the answers they sent and read them over almost as often as the letters they had received . It was rather a labor for Dick to write his . All his knowledge of reading and writing he had gained during a few months , when he had lived with his elder brother , and had gone to a night - school ; but , being a sharp boy , he had made the most of that brief education , and had spelled out things in newspapers since then , and practiced writing with bits of chalk on pavements or walls or fences . He told Mr. Hobbs all about his life and about his elder brother , who had been rather good to him after their mother died , when Dick was quite a little fellow . Their father had died some time before . The brother 's name was Ben , and he had taken care of Dick as well as he could , until the boy was old enough to sell newspapers and run errands . They had lived together , and as he grew older Ben had managed to get along until he had quite a decent place in a store . "
58804	58810	58496	58496	they	2049	" exclaimed Dick with disgust , "
59265	59341	59342	59343	That gal	2079	" He often told Mr. Hobbs stories of her and of his brother Ben , who , since his going out West , had written once or twice to Dick . Ben 's luck had not been good , and he had wandered from place to place ; but at last he had settled on a ranch in California , where he was at work at the time when Dick became acquainted with Mr. Hobbs . "
59345	59373	59342	59343	That gal	2079	" said Dick one day , ' she took all the grit out o ' him . I could n't help feelin ' sorry for him sometimes . "
59393	59402	59403	59403	he	46	" He ought n't to ' ve married , "
59415	59427	59403	59403	he	46	" Women I never could see any use in 'em myself . "
59446	59449	59450	59450	he	46	" Why ! "
59453	59489	59450	59450	he	46	" if here is n't a letter ! I did n't see it before . The postman must have laid it down when I was n't noticin ' , or the newspaper slipped over it . "
59500	59506	59507	59507	he	46	" It 's from HIM ! "
59510	59520	59507	59507	he	46	" That 's the very one it 's from ! "
59546	59556	59557	59557	he	46	" I wonder what news there is this time , "
59571	59574	59562	59562	he	46	" DORINCOURT CASTLE "
59579	59954	59562	59562	he	46	" I write this in a great hury becaus i have something curous to tell you i know you will be very mutch suprised my dear frend when i tel you . It is all a mistake and i am not a lord and i shall not have to be an earl there is a lady whitch was marid to my uncle bevis who is dead and she has a little boy and he is lord fauntleroy becaus that is the way it is in England the earls eldest sons little boy is the earl if every body else is dead i mean if his farther and grandfarther are dead my grandfarther is not dead but my uncle bevis is and so his boy is lord Fauntleroy and i am not becaus my papa was the youngest son and my name is Cedric Errol like it was when i was in New York and all the things will belong to the other boy i thought at first i should have to give him my pony and cart but my grandfarther says i need not my grandfarther is very sorry and i think he does not like the lady but preaps he thinks dearest and i are sorry because i shall not be an earl i would like to be an earl now better than i thout i would at first becaus this is a beautifle castle and i like every body so and when you are rich you can do so many things i am not rich now becaus when your papa is only the youngest son he is not very rich i am going to learn to work so that i can take care of dearest i have been asking Wilkins about grooming horses preaps i might be a groom or a coachman .

59958	59965	59966	59967	Mr. Hobbs	46	" CEDRIC ERROL Not lord Fauntleroy . "
59996	59999	60000	60000	he	46	" Well ! "
60003	60008	60000	60000	he	46	" I am jiggered ! "

60079	60082	60084	60085	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Bust ! "
60087	60173	60084	60085	Mr. Hobbs	46	" It 's my opinion it 's a put - up job o ' the British ristycrats to rob him of his rights because he 's an American . They 've had a spite agin us ever since the Revolution , an ' they 're takin ' it out on him . I told you he was n't safe , an ' see what 's happened ! Like as not , the whole gover'ment 's got together to rob him of his lawful ownin 's . "
60277	60285	60286	60286	he	46	" They 're trying to rob him ! "
60289	60308	60286	60286	he	46	" that 's what they 're doing , and folks that have money ought to look after him . "
60361	60365	60348	60348	he	46	" To Let , "
60725	60734	60735	60735	she	87	" An ' a bad lookout it is , "
60738	60936	60735	60735	she	87	" An ' if you were to ask me , ma'am , I should say as it was a judgment on him for the way he 's treated that sweet young cre'tur ' as he parted from her child , for he 's got that fond of him an ' that set on him an ' that proud of him as he 's a'most drove mad by what 's happened . An ' what 's more , this new one 's no lady , as his little lordship 's ma is . She 's a bold - faced , black - eyed thing , as Mr. Thomas says no gentleman in livery ' u'd bemean hisself to be gave orders by ; and let her come into the house , he says , an ' he goes out of it . An ' the boy do n't no more compare with the other one than nothin' you could mention . An ' mercy knows what 's goin' to come of it all , an ' where it 's to end , an ' you might have knocked me down with a feather when Jane brought the news . "
61027	61066	61086	61087	That person	2125	" never taught a young gen'leman to ride as took to it more nat'ral , or was a better - plucked one than he was . He was a one as it were some pleasure to ride behind . "
61185	61193	61194	61194	he	2126	" It makes me feel very queer , "
61197	61204	61194	61194	he	2126	" it makes me feel queer ! "
61257	61270	61271	61271	Cedric	39	" Will they take Dearest 's house from her and her carriage ? "
61282	61285	61287	61288	the Earl	203	" NO ! "
61299	61307	61287	61288	the Earl	203	" They can take nothing from her . "
61308	61311	61313	61313	Cedric	39	" Ah ! "
61319	61324	61313	61313	Cedric	39	" Ca n't they ? "
61351	61356	61357	61357	he	39	" That other boy , "
61361	61378	61357	61357	he	39	" he will have to to be your boy now as I was wo n't he ? "
61379	61382	61384	61385	the Earl	203	" NO ! "
61399	61402	61403	61403	he	39	" No ? "
61409	61416	61403	61403	he	39	" Wo n't he ? I thought "
61426	61444	61445	61445	he	39	" Shall I be your boy , even if I 'm not going to be an earl ? "
61448	61461	61445	61445	he	39	" Shall I be your boy , just as I was before ? "
61513	61517	61518	61518	he	191	" My boy ! "
61568	61602	61558	61558	he	191	" Yes , you 'll be my boy as long as I live ; and , by George , sometimes I feel as if you were the only boy I had ever had . "
61642	61646	61647	61647	he	39	" Do you ? "
61650	61719	61647	61647	he	39	" Well , then , I do n't care about the earl part at all . I do n't care whether I 'm an earl or not . I thought you see , I thought the one that was going to be the Earl would have to be your boy , too , and and I could n't be . That was what made me feel so queer . "
61733	61747	61748	61748	he	41	" They shall take nothing from you that I can hold for you , "
61756	61801	61748	61748	he	41	" I wo n't believe yet that they can take anything from you . You were made for the place , and well , you may fill it still . But whatever comes , you shall have all that I can give you all ! "
62009	62012	62013	62013	he	79	" hoped , "
62016	62052	62013	62013	he	79	" as he had wore livery in ' igh famblies long enough to know a lady when he see one , an ' if that was a lady he was no judge o ' females . "
62053	62060	62062	62062	Thomas	79	" The one at the Lodge , "
62065	62105	62062	62062	Thomas	79	" ' Merican or no ' Merican , she 's one o ' the right sort , as any gentleman ' u'd reckinize with all a heye . I remarked it myself to Henery when fust we called there . "
62196	62201	62202	62203	the lawyer	2506	" She is evidently , "
62209	62321	62202	62203	the lawyer	2506	" a person from the lower walks of life . She is uneducated and untrained in everything , and quite unused to meeting people like ourselves on any terms of equality . She does not know what to do . Her visit to the Castle quite cowed her . She was infuriated , but she was cowed . The Earl would not receive her , but I advised him to go with me to the Dorincourt Arms , where she is staying . When she saw him enter the room , she turned white , though she flew into a rage at once , and threatened and demanded in one breath . "
62402	62519	62399	62399	he	203	" You say you are my eldest son 's wife . If that is true , and if the proof you offer is too much for us , the law is on your side . In that case , your boy is Lord Fauntleroy . The matter will be sifted to the bottom , you may rest assured . If your claims are proved , you will be provided for . I want to see nothing of either you or the child so long as I live . The place will unfortunately have enough of you after my death . You are exactly the kind of person I should have expected my son Bevis to choose . "
62601	62610	62611	62611	she	2157	" It 's the Earl hisself , ma'am ! "
62668	62675	62676	62676	he	2160	" Mrs. Errol , I believe ? "
62679	62683	62684	62684	she	43	" Mrs. Errol , "
62687	62695	62696	62696	he	2160	" I am the Earl of Dorincourt , "
62751	62759	62760	62760	he	2160	" The boy is very like you , "
62764	62775	62776	62776	she	43	" It has been often said so , my lord , "
62779	62793	62776	62776	she	43	" but I have been glad to think him like his father also . "
62829	62832	62834	62835	the Earl	203	" Yes , "
62837	62845	62846	62846	He	203	" he is like my son too . "
62861	62866	62867	62867	he	203	" Do you know , "
62870	62877	62867	62867	he	203	" why I have come here ? "
62878	62885	62886	62887	Mrs. Errol	43	" I have seen Mr. Havisham , "
62890	62903	62886	62887	Mrs. Errol	43	" and he has told me of the claims which have been made "
62904	62912	62914	62915	the Earl	203	" I have come to tell you , "
62917	62955	62914	62915	the Earl	203	" that they will be investigated and contested , if a contest can be made . I have come to tell you that the boy shall be defended with all the power of the law . His rights "
62962	62984	62985	62985	she	43	" He must have nothing that is NOT his by right , even if the law can give it to him , "
62988	62995	62997	62998	the Earl	203	" Unfortunately the law can not , "
63000	63014	62997	62998	the Earl	203	" If it could , it should . This outrageous woman and her child "
63015	63032	63034	63036	little Mrs. Errol	43	" Perhaps she cares for him as much as I care for Cedric , my lord , "
63038	63060	63061	63061	She	43	" And if she was your eldest son 's wife , her son is Lord Fauntleroy , and mine is not . "
63120	63124	63125	63125	he	203	" I suppose , "
63131	63147	63125	63125	he	203	" that you would much prefer that he should not be the Earl of Dorincourt . "
63154	63171	63172	63172	she	43	" It is a very magnificent thing to be the Earl of Dorincourt , my lord , "
63175	63199	63172	63172	she	43	" I know that , but I care most that he should be what his father was brave and just and true always . "
63200	63212	63214	63215	his lordship	207	" In striking contrast to what his grandfather was , eh ? "
63218	63230	63232	63233	Mrs. Errol	43	" I have not had the pleasure of knowing his grandfather , "
63235	63243	63244	63244	She	43	" but I know my little boy believes "
63261	63269	63258	63258	she	43	" I know that Cedric loves you . "
63270	63277	63279	63280	the Earl	203	" Would he have loved me , "
63283	63299	63279	63280	the Earl	203	" if you had told him why I did not receive you at the Castle ? "
63300	63303	63305	63306	Mrs. Errol	43	" No , "
63308	63324	63305	63306	Mrs. Errol	43	" I think not . That was why I did not wish him to know . "
63325	63328	63330	63331	my lord	762	" Well , "
63334	63346	63330	63331	my lord	762	" there are few women who would not have told him . "
63367	63376	63377	63377	he	203	" Yes , he is fond of me , "
63380	63460	63377	63377	he	203	" and I am fond of him . I ca n't say I ever was fond of anything before . I am fond of him . He pleased me from the first . I am an old man , and was tired of my life . He has given me something to live for . I am proud of him . I was satisfied to think of his taking his place some day as the head of the family . "
63470	63475	63476	63476	he	2170	" I am miserable , "
63479	63482	63476	63476	he	2170	" Miserable ! "
63523	63538	63539	63539	he	2170	" Perhaps it is because I am miserable that I have come to you , "
63548	63676	63677	63677	He	2171	" I used to hate you ; I have been jealous of you . This wretched , disgraceful business has changed that . After seeing that repulsive woman who calls herself the wife of my son Bevis , I actually felt it would be a relief to look at you . I have been an obstinate old fool , and I suppose I have treated you badly . You are like the boy , and the boy is the first object in my life . I am miserable , and I came to you merely because you are like the boy , and he cares for you , and I care for him . Treat me as well as you can , for the boy 's sake . "
63722	63730	63731	63731	she	43	" I wish you would sit down , "
63742	63762	63731	63731	she	43	" You have been so much troubled that you are very tired , and you need all your strength . "
63794	63797	63805	63805	she	43	" the boy "
63903	63907	63908	63908	he	2171	" Whatever happens , "
63911	63932	63908	63908	he	2171	" the boy shall be provided for . He shall be taken care of , now and in the future . "
63944	63951	63952	63952	he	2171	" Do you like the house ? "
63955	63959	63960	63960	she	43	" Very much , "
63963	63970	63971	63971	he	2171	" This is a cheerful room , "
63974	63986	63971	63971	he	2171	" May I come here again and talk this matter over ? "
63987	63997	63998	63998	she	43	" As often as you wish , my lord , "
64446	64454	64456	64457	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Seems like somethin' orter be done , "
64459	64473	64456	64457	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Things like them orter be held on to earls or no earls . "
64540	64675	64532	64533	Mr. Hobbs	46	" DERE FREND : i got ure letter an Mr. Hobbs got his an we are sory u are down on ure luck an we say hold on as longs u kin an do nt let no one git ahed of u.

64678	64691	64676	64676	DICK	134	" And this was what Dick read in Mr. Hobbs 's letter : "
64790	64794	64795	64796	SILAS HOBBS	136	" Yrs truly , "
64798	64799	64795	64796	SILAS HOBBS	136	" "
64802	64807	64808	64808	he	136	" said Mr. Hobbs , "
64822	64823	64825	64825	he	136	" "
64828	64832	64825	64825	he	136	" said Dick . "
64854	65007	64843	64843	I	0	" The very next morning , one of Dick 's customers was rather surprised . He was a young lawyer just beginning practice as poor as a very young lawyer can possibly be , but a bright , energetic young fellow , with sharp wit and a good temper . He had a shabby office near Dick 's stand , and every morning Dick blacked his boots for him , and quite often they were not exactly water - tight , but he always had a friendly word or a joke for Dick . That particular morning , when he put his foot on the rest , he had an illustrated paper in his hand an enterprising paper , with pictures in it of conspicuous people and things . He had just finished looking it over , and when the last boot was polished , he handed it over to the boy . "
65017	65021	64843	64843	I	0	" he said ; "
65113	65149	65105	65105	I	0	" The pictures he spoke of were on the front page , and Dick was staring at one of them with his eyes and mouth open , and his sharp face almost pale with excitement . "
65157	65163	65155	65155	Dick	134	" said the young man . "
65169	65192	65155	65155	Dick	134	" Dick really did look as if something tremendous had happened . He pointed to the picture , under which was written : "
65199	65223	65224	65224	Her	2218	" It was the picture of a handsome woman , with large eyes and heavy braids of black hair wound around her head . "
65226	65230	65231	65231	My	0	" said Dick . "
65243	65251	65241	65241	you	134	" The young man began to laugh . "
65260	65264	65254	65254	you	134	" he said . "
65279	65315	65270	65270	you	134	" Dick actually forgot to grin . He began to gather his brushes and things together , as if he had something to do which would put an end to his business for the present . "
65319	65323	65270	65270	you	134	" he said . "
65338	65426	65329	65329	I	0	" And in less than five minutes from that time he was tearing through the streets on his way to Mr. Hobbs and the corner store . Mr. Hobbs could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses when he looked across the counter and saw Dick rush in with the paper in his hand . The boy was out of breath with running ; so much out of breath , in fact , that he could scarcely speak as he threw the paper down on the counter . "
65429	65434	65329	65329	I	0	" exclaimed Mr. Hobbs . "
65442	65443	65438	65438	you	0	" "
65448	65452	65438	65438	you	0	" panted Dick . "
65479	65484	65475	65475	SHE	2218	" with withering scorn . "
65520	65528	65518	65518	him	127	" Mr. Hobbs dropped into his seat . "
65539	65543	65544	65544	I	0	" he said . "
65563	65564	65549	65549	they	2226	" "
65568	65575	65576	65576	SHE	2218	" cried Dick , with disgust . "
65695	65869	65687	65687	she	2218	" Professor Dick Tipton had always been a sharp boy , and earning his living in the streets of a big city had made him still sharper . He had learned to keep his eyes open and his wits about him , and it must be confessed he enjoyed immensely the excitement and impatience of that moment . If little Lord Fauntleroy could only have looked into the store that morning , he would certainly have been interested , even if all the discussion and plans had been intended to decide the fate of some other boy than himself . Mr. Hobbs was almost overwhelmed by his sense of responsibility , and Dick was all alive and full of energy . He began to write a letter to Ben , and he cut out the picture and inclosed it to him , and Mr. Hobbs wrote a letter to Cedric and one to the Earl . They were in the midst of this letter - writing when a new idea came to Dick . "
65872	65876	65687	65687	she	2218	" he said , "
65905	65920	65900	65900	Lawyers	2236	" Mr. Hobbs was immensely impressed by this suggestion and Dick 's business capacity . "
65925	65929	65900	65900	Lawyers	2236	" he replied . "
65936	66070	65900	65900	Lawyers	2236	" And leaving the store in the care of a substitute , he struggled into his coat and marched down - town with Dick , and the two presented themselves with their romantic story in Mr. Harrison 's office , much to that young man 's astonishment . If he had not been a very young lawyer , with a very enterprising mind and a great deal of spare time on his hands , he might not have been so readily interested in what they had to say , for it all certainly sounded very wild and queer ; but he chanced to want something to do very much , and he chanced to know Dick , and Dick chanced to say his say in a very sharp , telling sort of way . "
66073	66114	65900	65900	Lawyers	2236	" said Mr. Hobbs , ' say what your time 's worth a ' hour and look into this thing thorough , and I'LL pay the damage , Silas Hobbs , corner of Blank street , Vegetables and Fancy Groceries . "
66115	66118	66120	66121	Mr. Harrison	124	" Well , "
66123	66215	66120	66121	Mr. Harrison	124	" it will be a big thing if it turns out all right , and it will be almost as big a thing for me as for Lord Fauntleroy ; and , at any rate , no harm can be done by investigating . It appears there has been some dubiousness about the child . The woman contradicted herself in some of her statements about his age , and aroused suspicion . The first persons to be written to are Dick 's brother and the Earl of Dorincourt 's family lawyer . "
66688	66697	66699	66700	Mr. Havisham	51	" After my first three meetings with her , "
66702	66826	66699	66700	Mr. Havisham	51	" I began to suspect her strongly . It appeared to me that the child was older than she said he was , and she made a slip in speaking of the date of his birth and then tried to patch the matter up . The story these letters bring fits in with several of my suspicions . Our best plan will be to cable at once for these two Tiptons , say nothing about them to her , and suddenly confront her with them when she is not expecting it . She is only a very clumsy plotter , after all . My opinion is that she will be frightened out of her wits , and will betray herself on the spot . "
66909	66914	66933	66933	he	51	" The Dorincourt Arms , "
67046	67051	67052	67052	he	59	" Hello , Minna ! "
67071	67077	67061	67061	Ben	138	" Do you know her ? "
67089	67092	67094	67094	Ben	138	" Yes , "
67096	67105	67107	67107	he	2268	" I know her and she knows me . "
67206	67216	67217	67217	he	138	" I can swear to her in any court , "
67223	67295	67217	67217	he	138	" and I can bring a dozen others who will . Her father is a respectable sort of man , though he 's low down in the world . Her mother was just like herself . She 's dead , but he 's alive , and he 's honest enough to be ashamed of her . He 'll tell you who she is , and whether she married me or not . "
67307	67313	67314	67314	he	51	" Where 's the child ? "
67317	67335	67314	67314	he	51	" He 's going with me ! He is done with you , and so am I ! "
67431	67434	67435	67435	he	138	" Yes , "
67438	67449	67450	67450	he	138	" I could swear to him , too . Tom , "
67457	67476	67450	67450	he	138	" I 'm your father ; I 've come to take you away . Where 's your hat ? "
67583	67590	67591	67591	he	138	" If you want me again , "
67597	67605	67606	67606	He	138	" you know where to find me . "
67657	67666	67668	67669	Mr. Havisham	51	" Come , come , my young woman , "
67671	67695	67668	67669	Mr. Havisham	51	" This wo n't do at all . If you do n't want to be locked up , you really must behave yourself . "
67747	67757	67759	67760	Mr. Havisham	51	" We shall have no more trouble with her , "
67807	67812	67813	67813	he	203	" To Court Lodge , "
67818	67823	67825	67825	Thomas	79	" To Court Lodge , "
67835	67851	67825	67825	Thomas	79	" an ' you may depend on it , things are taking a uniggspected turn . "
67899	67902	67903	67903	he	203	" Where , "
67906	67911	67903	67903	he	203	" is Lord Fauntleroy ? "
67924	67930	67931	67931	she	43	" Is it Lord Fauntleroy ? "
67934	67940	67912	67913	Mrs. Errol	43	" Is it , indeed ! "
67951	67954	67955	67955	he	203	" Yes , "
67958	67962	67955	67955	he	203	" it is . "
67974	67977	67978	67978	he	203	" Fauntleroy , "
67987	68001	67978	67978	he	203	" ask your mother when she will come to us at the Castle . "
68012	68018	68019	68019	he	203	" To live with us ! "
68022	68029	68019	68019	he	203	" To live with us always ! "
68085	68094	68096	68097	Mrs. Errol	43	" Are you quite sure you want me ? "
68106	68110	68111	68111	he	203	" Quite sure , "
68115	68137	68111	68111	he	203	" We have always wanted you , but we were not exactly aware of it . We hope you will come . "
68472	68480	68482	68483	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" Just like the Fourth of July ! "
68485	68511	68482	68483	Lord Fauntleroy	50	" It seems a pity my birthday was n't on the Fourth , does n't it ? For then we could keep them both together . "
68696	68705	68706	68706	he	46	" Somethin' in the manner of a museum ? "
68722	68726	68728	68728	Fauntleroy	50	" N no ! "
68733	68751	68728	68728	Fauntleroy	50	" I do n't THINK it 's a museum . My grandfather says these are my ancestors . "
68752	68758	68760	68761	Mr. Hobbs	46	" Your aunt 's sisters ! "
68763	68786	68760	68761	Mr. Hobbs	46	" ALL of 'em ? Your great - uncle , he MUST have had a family ! Did he raise 'em all ? "
68964	68971	68972	68972	he	46	" And they was all earls ! "
68976	68999	68972	68972	he	46	" er pretty nigh it ! An ' HE 'S goin' to be one of 'em , an ' own it all ! "
69068	69081	69082	69082	he	46	" I would n't have minded bein ' one of 'em myself ! "
69501	69521	69498	69498	she	122	" Dear little Lord Fauntleroy ! dear little boy ! I am so glad ! I am so glad ! "
69557	69603	69541	69541	he	50	" This is my old , old friend Mr. Hobbs , Miss Herbert , and this is my other old friend Dick . I told them how pretty you were , and I told them they should see you if you came to my birthday , "
69672	69675	69677	69677	Dick	59	" Well , "
69714	70298	70299	70301	Little Lord Fauntleroy	50	" Everybody looked after her as she passed , and every one looked after little Lord Fauntleroy . And the sun shone and the flags fluttered and the games were played and the dances danced , and as the gayeties went on and the joyous afternoon passed , his little lordship was simply radiantly happy . The whole world seemed beautiful to him . There was some one else who was happy , too , an old man , who , though he had been rich and noble all his life , had not often been very honestly happy . Perhaps , indeed , I shall tell you that I think it was because he was rather better than he had been that he was rather happier . He had not , indeed , suddenly become as good as Fauntleroy thought him ; but , at least , he had begun to love something , and he had several times found a sort of pleasure in doing the kind things which the innocent , kind little heart of a child had suggested , and that was a beginning . And every day he had been more pleased with his son 's wife . It was true , as the people said , that he was beginning to like her too . He liked to hear her sweet voice and to see her sweet face ; and as he sat in his arm - chair , he used to watch her and listen as she talked to her boy ; and he heard loving , gentle words which were new to him , and he began to see why the little fellow who had lived in a New York side street and known grocery - men and made friends with boot - blacks , was still so well - bred and manly a little fellow that he made no one ashamed of him , even when fortune changed him into the heir to an English earldom , living in an English castle . It was really a very simple thing , after all , it was only that he had lived near a kind and gentle heart , and had been taught to think kind thoughts always and to care for others . It is a very little thing , perhaps , but it is the best thing of all . He knew nothing of earls and castles ; he was quite ignorant of all grand and splendid things ; but he was always lovable because he was simple and loving . To be so is like being born a king . As the old Earl of Dorincourt looked at him that day , moving about the park among the people , talking to those he knew and making his ready little bow when any one greeted him , entertaining his friends Dick and Mr. Hobbs , or standing near his mother or Miss Herbert listening to their conversation , the old nobleman was very well satisfied with him . And he had never been better satisfied than he was when they went down to the biggest tent , where the more important tenants of the Dorincourt estate were sitting down to the grand collation of the day . They were drinking toasts ; and , after they had drunk the health of the Earl , with much more enthusiasm than his name had ever been greeted with before , they proposed the health of "
70303	70435	70299	70301	Little Lord Fauntleroy	50	" And if there had ever been any doubt at all as to whether his lordship was popular or not , it would have been settled that instant . Such a clamor of voices , and such a rattle of glasses and applause ! They had begun to like him so much , those warm - hearted people , that they forgot to feel any restraint before the ladies and gentlemen from the castle , who had come to see them . They made quite a decent uproar , and one or two motherly women looked tenderly at the little fellow where he stood , with his mother on one side and the Earl on the other , and grew quite moist about the eyes , and said to one another : "
70445	70476	70438	70438	him	50	" Little Lord Fauntleroy was delighted . He stood and smiled , and made bows , and flushed rosy red with pleasure up to the roots of his bright hair . "
70486	70493	70480	70480	they	2395	" he said to his mother . "
70504	70522	70523	70523	Fauntleroy	50	" And then the Earl put his hand on the child 's shoulder and said to him : "
70536	70550	70552	70552	I	0	" Fauntleroy gave a glance up at him and then at his mother . "
70554	70629	70552	70552	I	0	" he asked just a trifle shyly , and she smiled , and so did Miss Herbert , and they both nodded . And so he made a little step forward , and everybody looked at him such a beautiful , innocent little fellow he was , too , with his brave , trustful face ! and he spoke as loudly as he could , his childish voice ringing out quite clear and strong . "
70639	70643	70645	70645	I	0	" he said , "
70722	70936	70719	70720	my grandfather	3090	" And amid the shouts and clamor of applause , he stepped back with a little sigh of relief , and put his hand into the Earl 's and stood close to him , smiling and leaning against his side . And that would be the very end of my story ; but I must add one curious piece of information , which is that Mr. Hobbs became so fascinated with high life and was so reluctant to leave his young friend that he actually sold his corner store in New York , and settled in the English village of Erlesboro , where he opened a shop which was patronized by the Castle and consequently was a great success . And though he and the Earl never became very intimate , if you will believe me , that man Hobbs became in time more aristocratic than his lordship himself , and he read the Court news every morning , and followed all the doings of the House of Lords ! And about ten years after , when Dick , who had finished his education and was going to visit his brother in California , asked the good grocer if he did not wish to return to America , he shook his head seriously . "
70942	70946	70719	70720	my grandfather	3090	" he said . "
