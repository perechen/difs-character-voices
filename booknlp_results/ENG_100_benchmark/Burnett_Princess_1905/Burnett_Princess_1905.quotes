369	372	354	354	she	18	" papa . "
373	380	381	382	Captain Crewe	19	" What is it , darling ? "
395	402	381	382	Captain Crewe	19	" What is Sara thinking of ? "
403	409	410	410	Sara	18	" Is this the place ? "
419	425	410	410	Sara	18	" Is it , papa ? "
426	442	455	455	he	129	" Yes , little Sara , it is . We have reached it at last . "
478	482	484	484	she	18	" the place , "
615	619	605	611	many servants who made salaams to her	159	" Missee Sahib , "
682	685	686	686	she	18	" the place "
792	805	806	806	she	18	" Could n't you go to that place with me , papa ? "
816	834	806	806	she	18	" Could n't you go to school , too ? I would help you with your lessons . "
835	852	853	853	he	129	" But you will not have to stay for a very long time , little Sara , "
858	921	853	853	he	129	" You will go to a nice house where there will be a lot of little girls , and you will play together , and I will send you plenty of books , and you will grow so fast that it will seem scarcely a year before you are big enough and clever enough to come back and take care of papa . "
984	987	1003	1003	She	18	" the place "
1072	1077	1078	1078	she	18	" Well , papa , "
1082	1094	1078	1078	she	18	" if we are here I suppose we must be resigned . "
1256	1263	1265	1266	Captain Crewe	19	" Here we are , Sara , "
1423	1432	1433	1433	she	18	" I do n't like it , papa , "
1436	1454	1433	1433	she	18	" But then I dare say soldiers even brave ones do n't really LIKE going into battle . "
1481	1487	1488	1488	he	19	" Oh , little Sara , "
1491	1518	1488	1488	he	19	" What shall I do when I have no one to say solemn things to me ? No one else is as solemn as you are . "
1519	1530	1532	1532	Sara	18	" But why do solemn things make you laugh so ? "
1534	1545	1546	1546	he	19	" Because you are such fun when you say them , "
1700	1721	1722	1722	she	18	" It will be a great privilege to have charge of such a beautiful and promising child , Captain Crewe , "
1733	1757	1722	1722	she	18	" Lady Meredith has told me of her unusual cleverness . A clever child is a great treasure in an establishment like mine . "
1781	1792	1793	1793	she	18	" Why does she say I am a beautiful child ? "
1797	1876	1793	1793	she	18	" I am not beautiful at all . Colonel Grange 's little girl , Isobel , is beautiful . She has dimples and rose - colored cheeks , and long hair the color of gold . I have short black hair and green eyes ; besides which , I am a thin child and not fair in the least . I am one of the ugliest children I ever saw . She is beginning by telling a story . "
2026	2040	2041	2041	she	18	" I should be telling a story if I said she was beautiful , "
2044	2075	2041	2041	she	18	" and I should know I was telling a story . I believe I am as ugly as she is in my way . What did she say that for ? "
2166	2171	2158	2158	Sara	18	" a parlor boarder , "
2228	2240	2241	2242	Captain Crewe	19	" I am not in the least anxious about her education , "
2260	2393	2251	2251	he	19	" The difficulty will be to keep her from learning too fast and too much . She is always sitting with her little nose burrowing into books . She does n't read them , Miss Minchin ; she gobbles them up as if she were a little wolf instead of a little girl . She is always starving for new books to gobble , and she wants grown - up books great , big , fat ones French and German as well as English history and biography and poets , and all sorts of things . Drag her away from her books when she reads too much . Make her ride her pony in the Row or go out and buy a new doll . She ought to play more with dolls . "
2394	2397	2399	2399	Sara	18	" Papa , "
2401	2444	2399	2399	Sara	18	" you see , if I went out and bought a new doll every few days I should have more than I could be fond of . Dolls ought to be intimate friends . Emily is going to be my intimate friend . "
2459	2464	2465	2465	she	22	" Who is Emily ? "
2468	2474	2475	2476	Captain Crewe	19	" Tell her , Sara , "
2497	2508	2509	2509	she	18	" She is a doll I have n't got yet , "
2512	2561	2509	2509	she	18	" She is a doll papa is going to buy for me . We are going out together to find her . I have called her Emily . She is going to be my friend when papa is gone . I want her to talk to about him . "
2574	2580	2581	2581	she	18	" What an original child ! "
2584	2591	2581	2581	she	18	" What a darling little creature ! "
2592	2595	2597	2598	Captain Crewe	19	" Yes , "
2604	2623	2597	2598	Captain Crewe	19	" She is a darling little creature . Take great care of her for me , Miss Minchin . "
2837	2852	2853	2853	Sara	18	" I want her to look as if she was n't a doll really , "
2856	2878	2880	2880	she	18	" I want her to look as if she LISTENS when I talk to her . The trouble with dolls , papa "
2893	2906	2880	2880	she	18	" the trouble with dolls is that they never seem to HEAR . "
2942	2946	2947	2947	Sara	18	" You see , "
2959	2997	2947	2947	Sara	18	" If , when I find her , she has no frocks , we can take her to a dressmaker and have her things made to fit . They will fit better if they are tried on . "
3060	3065	3066	3066	she	18	" Oh , papa ! "
3069	3074	3066	3066	she	18	" There is Emily ! "
3108	3117	3118	3118	she	18	" She is actually waiting there for us ! "
3121	3129	3118	3118	she	18	" Let us go in to her . "
3130	3134	3136	3137	Captain Crewe	19	" Dear me , "
3139	3153	3136	3137	Captain Crewe	19	" I feel as if we ought to have someone to introduce us . "
3154	3165	3167	3167	Sara	18	" You must introduce me and I will introduce you , "
3169	3187	3167	3167	Sara	18	" But I knew her the minute I saw her so perhaps she knew me , too . "
3272	3276	3278	3278	Sara	18	" Of course , "
3292	3301	3278	3278	Sara	18	" of course papa , this is Emily . "
3359	3378	3380	3380	Sara	18	" I should like her always to look as if she was a child with a good mother , "
3382	3399	3380	3380	Sara	18	" I 'm her mother , though I am going to make a companion of her . "
3542	3550	3551	3551	he	19	" Heigh - ho , little Sara ! "
3555	3570	3551	3551	he	19	" I do n't believe you know how much your daddy will miss you . "
3660	3681	3682	3682	he	19	" She is a sensible little thing , and she never wants anything it is n't safe to give her , "
3730	3741	3742	3742	he	19	" Are you learning me by heart , little Sara ? "
3749	3752	3753	3753	she	18	" No , "
3756	3769	3753	3753	she	18	" I know you by heart . You are inside my heart . "
3872	3878	3863	3863	she	22	" I have locked it , "
3889	3902	3863	3863	she	22	" I want to be quite by myself , if you please . "
3948	3963	3964	3964	she	22	" I never saw such a funny , old - fashioned child , sister , "
3967	3985	3964	3964	she	22	" She has locked herself in , and she is not making the least particle of noise . "
3986	4004	4005	4006	Miss Minchin	22	" It is much better than if she kicked and screamed , as some of them do , "
4009	4045	4005	4006	Miss Minchin	22	" I expected that a child as much spoiled as she is would set the whole house in an uproar . If ever a child was given her own way in everything , she is . "
4046	4059	4061	4062	Miss Amelia	22	" I 've been opening her trunks and putting her things away , "
4064	4101	4061	4062	Miss Amelia	22	" I never saw anything like them sable and ermine on her coats , and real Valenciennes lace on her underclothing . You have seen some of her clothes . What DO you think of them ? "
4102	4110	4112	4113	Miss Minchin	22	" I think they are perfectly ridiculous , "
4117	4153	4112	4113	Miss Minchin	22	" but they will look very well at the head of the line when we take the schoolchildren to church on Sunday . She has been provided for as if she were a little princess . "
4337	4352	4353	4353	she	30	" It was full of petticoats with lace frills on them frills and frills , "
4366	4424	4353	4353	she	30	" I saw her shaking them out . I heard Miss Minchin say to Miss Amelia that her clothes were so grand that they were ridiculous for a child . My mamma says that children should be dressed simply . She has got one of those petticoats on now . I saw it when she sat down . "
4425	4432	4434	4434	Jessie	33	" She has silk stockings on ! "
4442	4455	4434	4434	Jessie	33	" And what little feet ! I never saw such little feet . "
4456	4459	4461	4461	Lavinia	30	" Oh , "
4465	4513	4461	4461	Lavinia	30	" that is the way her slippers are made . My mamma says that even big feet can be made to look small if you have a clever shoemaker . I do n't think she is pretty at all . Her eyes are such a queer color . "
4514	4525	4527	4527	Jessie	33	" She is n't pretty as other pretty people are , "
4536	4561	4527	4527	Jessie	33	" but she makes you want to look at her again . She has tremendously long eyelashes , but her eyes are almost green . "
4669	4679	4680	4680	she	22	" He is on the sea now , Emily , "
4684	4721	4680	4680	she	22	" We must be very great friends to each other and tell each other things . Emily , look at me . You have the nicest eyes I ever saw but I wish you could speak . "
4804	4814	4815	4815	she	32	" You can read that while I am downstairs , "
4837	4844	4845	4845	she	32	" What I believe about dolls , "
4848	4994	4845	4845	she	32	" is that they can do things they will not let us know about . Perhaps , really , Emily can read and talk and walk , but she will only do it when people are out of the room . That is her secret . You see , if people knew that dolls could do things , they would make them work . So , perhaps , they have promised each other to keep it a secret . If you stay in the room , Emily will just sit there and stare ; but if you go out , she will begin to read , perhaps , or go and look out of the window . Then if she heard either of us coming , she would just run back and jump into her chair and pretend she had been there all the time . "
4995	5001	5002	5002	Mariette	32	" Comme elle est drole ! "
5074	5081	5056	5056	Sara	18	" If you please , Mariette , "
5082	5088	5056	5056	Sara	18	" Thank you , Mariette , "
5111	5121	5122	5122	she	32	" Elle a l'air d'une princesse , cette petite , "
5176	5180	5181	5181	she	22	" Young ladies , "
5184	5195	5181	5181	she	22	" I wish to introduce you to your new companion . "
5210	5254	5206	5206	Sara	18	" I shall expect you all to be very agreeable to Miss Crewe ; she has just come to us from a great distance in fact , from India . As soon as lessons are over you must make each other 's acquaintance . "
5279	5282	5284	5285	Miss Minchin	22	" Sara , "
5291	5297	5284	5285	Miss Minchin	22	" come here to me . "
5319	5331	5332	5332	she	22	" As your papa has engaged a French maid for you , "
5335	5352	5332	5332	she	22	" I conclude that he wishes you to make a special study of the French language . "
5359	5366	5367	5367	she	18	" I think he engaged her , "
5370	5383	5367	5367	she	18	" because he he thought I would like her , Miss Minchin . "
5384	5389	5391	5392	Miss Minchin	22	" I am afraid , "
5400	5434	5391	5392	Miss Minchin	22	" that you have been a very spoiled little girl and always imagine that things are done because you like them . My impression is that your papa wished you to learn French . "
5577	5588	5589	5589	she	18	" I I have never really learned French , but but "
5649	5654	5655	5655	she	22	" That is enough , "
5661	5700	5655	5655	she	22	" If you have not learned , you must begin at once . The French master , Monsieur Dufarge , will be here in a few minutes . Take this book and look at it until he arrives . "
5765	5768	5786	5787	Miss Minchin	22	" le pere "
5770	5774	5786	5787	Miss Minchin	22	" the father , "

5781	5785	5786	5787	Miss Minchin	22	" the mother . "
5793	5801	5802	5802	she	22	" You look rather cross , Sara , "
5805	5819	5802	5802	she	22	" I am sorry you do not like the idea of learning French . "
5820	5828	5830	5830	Sara	18	" I am very fond of it , "
5838	5840	5833	5833	she	18	" but "
5841	5857	5859	5860	Miss Minchin	22	" You must not say ' but ' when you are told to do things , "
5862	5869	5859	5860	Miss Minchin	22	" Look at your book again . "
5885	5888	5871	5871	Sara	18	" le fils "

5901	5905	5871	5871	Sara	18	" the brother . "
5906	5912	5913	5913	she	18	" When Monsieur Dufarge comes , "
5916	5923	5913	5913	she	18	" I can make him understand . "
5966	5977	5978	5978	he	35	" Is this a new pupil for me , madame ? "
5984	5993	5978	5978	he	35	" I hope that is my good fortune . "
5994	6030	6032	6033	Miss Minchin	22	" Her papa Captain Crewe is very anxious that she should begin the language . But I am afraid she has a childish prejudice against it . She does not seem to wish to learn , "
6035	6044	6045	6045	he	35	" I am sorry of that , mademoiselle , "
6051	6072	6045	6045	he	35	" Perhaps , when we begin to study together , I may show you that it is a charming tongue . "
6365	6370	6371	6371	he	35	" Ah , madame , "
6374	6399	6371	6371	he	35	" there is not much I can teach her . She has not LEARNED French ; she is French . Her accent is exquisite . "
6400	6408	6410	6411	Miss Minchin	22	" You ought to have told me , "
6420	6425	6427	6427	Sara	18	" I I tried , "
6429	6439	6427	6427	Sara	18	" I I suppose I did not begin right . "
6489	6495	6496	6496	she	22	" Silence , young ladies ! "
6505	6510	6496	6496	she	22	" Silence at once ! "

7299	7305	7306	7306	she	18	" What is your name ? "
7387	7395	7396	7396	she	18	" My name 's Ermengarde St. John , "
7399	7405	7407	7407	Sara	18	" Mine is Sara Crewe , "
7409	7422	7407	7407	Sara	18	" Yours is very pretty . It sounds like a story book . "
7423	7429	7431	7431	Ermengarde	40	" Do you like it ? "
7433	7439	7431	7431	Ermengarde	40	" I I like yours . "
7572	7576	7577	7577	he	343	" Good heavens ! "
7590	7606	7577	7577	he	343	" there are times when I think she is as stupid as her Aunt Eliza ! "

7725	7735	7736	7736	she	40	" You can speak French , ca n't you ? "
7773	7787	7788	7788	she	18	" I can speak it because I have heard it all my life , "
7791	7803	7788	7788	she	18	" You could speak it if you had always heard it . "
7804	7813	7815	7815	Ermengarde	40	" Oh , no , I could n't , "
7817	7824	7815	7815	Ermengarde	40	" I NEVER could speak it ! "
7825	7828	7830	7830	Sara	18	" Why ? "
7844	7851	7852	7852	she	40	" You heard me just now , "
7855	7874	7852	7852	she	40	" I 'm always like that . I ca n't SAY the words . They 're so queer . "
7892	7901	7875	7875	She	40	" You are CLEVER , are n't you ? "
7950	7953	7948	7948	she	18	" clever , "

8022	8027	8028	8028	Ermengarde	40	" Who is Emily ? "
8038	8047	8049	8049	Sara	18	" Come up to my room and see , "
8070	8075	8076	8076	Ermengarde	40	" Is it true , "
8085	8098	8076	8076	Ermengarde	40	" is it true that you have a playroom all to yourself ? "
8099	8102	8103	8103	Sara	18	" Yes , "
8106	8155	8103	8103	Sara	18	" Papa asked Miss Minchin to let me have one , because well , it was because when I play I make up stories and tell them to myself , and I do n't like people to hear me . It spoils it if I think people listen . "
8183	8189	8190	8190	she	40	" You MAKE up stories ! "
8193	8207	8190	8190	she	40	" Can you do that as well as speak French ? CAN you ? "
8216	8225	8226	8226	she	18	" Why , anyone can make up things , "
8229	8235	8226	8226	she	18	" Have you never tried ? "
8245	8255	8256	8256	she	18	" Let us go very quietly to the door , "
8259	8275	8256	8256	she	18	" and then I will open it quite suddenly ; perhaps we may catch her . "
8314	8317	8327	8327	she	18	" catch , "
8414	8429	8430	8430	Sara	18	" Oh , she got back to her seat before we could see her ! "
8433	8447	8430	8430	Sara	18	" Of course they always do . They are as quick as lightning . "
8459	8464	8465	8465	she	40	" Can she walk ? "
8469	8472	8474	8474	Sara	18	" Yes , "
8476	8510	8474	8474	Sara	18	" At least I believe she can . At least I PRETEND I believe she can . And that makes it seem as if it were true . Have you never pretended things ? "
8511	8514	8516	8516	Ermengarde	40	" No , "
8518	8527	8516	8516	Ermengarde	40	" Never . I tell me about it . "
8562	8568	8570	8570	Sara	18	" Let us sit down , "
8572	8634	8570	8570	Sara	18	" and I will tell you . It 's so easy that when you begin you ca n't stop . You just go on and on doing it always . And it 's beautiful . Emily , you must listen . This is Ermengarde St. John , Emily . Ermengarde , this is Emily . Would you like to hold her ? "
8635	8641	8643	8643	Ermengarde	40	" Oh , may I ? "
8645	8655	8643	8643	Ermengarde	40	" May I , really ? She is beautiful ! "
8795	8798	8753	8753	her	18	" like lightning "
8806	8813	8815	8815	Sara	18	" WE could n't do it , "
8819	8830	8815	8815	Sara	18	" You see , it 's a kind of magic . "
8942	8949	8950	8950	Ermengarde	40	" Have you a a pain ? "
8953	8956	8957	8957	Sara	18	" Yes , "
8966	8975	8957	8957	Sara	18	" But it is not in my body . "
8997	9013	8977	8977	she	18	" Do you love your father more than anything else in all the whole world ? "
9081	9089	9090	9090	she	40	" I I scarcely ever see him , "
9093	9103	9090	9090	she	40	" He is always in the library reading things . "
9104	9117	9118	9118	Sara	18	" I love mine more than all the world ten times over , "
9121	9134	9118	9118	Sara	18	" That is what my pain is . He has gone away . "
9159	9168	9170	9170	Ermengarde	40	" She 's going to cry out loud , "
9202	9211	9212	9212	she	40	" I promised him I would bear it , "
9215	9267	9195	9195	she	40	" And I will . You have to bear things . Think what soldiers bear ! Papa is a soldier . If there was a war he would have to bear marching and thirstiness and , perhaps , deep wounds . And he would never say a word not one word . "
9315	9324	9325	9325	she	40	" If I go on talking and talking , "
9328	9353	9325	9325	she	40	" and telling you things about pretending , I shall bear it better . You do n't forget , but you bear it better . "
9376	9386	9387	9387	she	40	" Lavinia and Jessie are ' best friends , ' "
9392	9434	9387	9387	she	40	" I wish we could be ' best friends . ' Would you have me for yours ? You 're clever , and I 'm the stupidest child in the school , but I oh , I do so like you ! "
9435	9442	9444	9444	Sara	18	" I 'm glad of that , "
9446	9469	9474	9474	her	18	" It makes you thankful when you are liked . Yes . We will be friends . And I 'll tell you what "
9476	9486	9474	9474	her	18	" I can help you with your French lessons . "
9806	9814	9815	9815	she	18	" Things happen to people by accident , "
9820	9916	9815	9815	she	18	" A lot of nice accidents have happened to me . It just HAPPENED that I always liked lessons and books , and could remember things when I learned them . It just happened that I was born with a father who was beautiful and nice and clever , and could give me everything I liked . Perhaps I have not really a good temper at all , but if you have everything you want and everyone is kind to you , how can you help but be good - tempered ? I do n't know "
9920	9961	9815	9815	she	18	" how I shall ever find out whether I am really a nice child or a horrid one . Perhaps I 'm a HIDEOUS child , and no one will ever know , just because I never have any trials . "
9962	9968	9970	9970	Ermengarde	40	" Lavinia has no trials , "
9974	9981	9970	9970	Ermengarde	40	" and she is horrid enough . "
9999	10002	10003	10003	she	18	" Well , "
10008	10018	10003	10003	she	18	" perhaps perhaps that is because Lavinia is GROWING . "
10218	10227	10228	10228	Jessie	33	" There 's one thing about Sara Crewe , "
10232	10235	10256	10256	she	30	" best friend "
10302	10302	10293	10294	Miss Minchin	22	"
10303	10322	10324	10324	Lavinia	30	" ' Dear Sara must come into the drawing room and talk to Mrs. Musgrave about India , ' "
10336	10423	10327	10327	her	30	" ' Dear Sara must speak French to Lady Pitkin . Her accent is so perfect . ' She did n't learn her French at the Seminary , at any rate . And there 's nothing so clever in her knowing it . She says herself she did n't learn it at all . She just picked it up , because she always heard her papa speak it . And , as to her papa , there is nothing so grand in being an Indian officer . "
10424	10427	10429	10429	Jessie	33	" Well , "
10433	10480	10429	10429	Jessie	33	" he 's killed tigers . He killed the one in the skin Sara has in her room . That 's why she likes it so . She lies on it and strokes its head , and talks to it as if it was a cat . "
10481	10489	10491	10491	Lavinia	30	" She 's always doing something silly , "
10493	10515	10491	10491	Lavinia	30	" My mamma says that way of hers of pretending things is silly . She says she will grow up eccentric . "
10524	10527	10429	10429	Jessie	33	" grand . "
10650	10659	10660	10660	she	18	" If you are four you are four , "
10680	10684	10660	10660	she	18	" a brat ; "
10685	10703	10660	10660	she	18	" but you will be five next year , and six the year after that . And , "
10710	10720	10660	10660	she	18	" it takes sixteen years to make you twenty . "
10721	10725	10727	10727	Lavinia	30	" Dear me , "
10729	10735	10727	10727	Lavinia	30	" how we can calculate ! "
11159	11166	11167	11167	she	261	" What IS she crying for ? "
11171	11176	11177	11177	Sara	18	" Oh oh oh ! "
11180	11191	11177	11177	Sara	18	" I have n't got any mam ma - a ! "
11192	11197	11199	11200	Miss Amelia	22	" Oh , Lottie ! "
11202	11216	11199	11200	Miss Amelia	22	" Do stop , darling ! Do n't cry ! Please do n't ! "
11217	11228	11229	11229	Lottie	31	" Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! "
11233	11243	11229	11229	Lottie	31	" Have n't got any mam ma - a ! "
11244	11251	11252	11253	Miss Minchin	22	" She ought to be whipped , "
11256	11266	11252	11253	Miss Minchin	22	" You SHALL be whipped , you naughty child ! "
11387	11392	11393	11393	she	22	" Oh , Sara ! "
11403	11407	11409	11409	Sara	18	" I stopped , "
11411	11440	11409	11409	Sara	18	" because I knew it was Lottie and I thought , perhaps just perhaps , I could make her be quiet . May I try , Miss Minchin ? "
11441	11452	11454	11455	Miss Minchin	22	" If you can , you are a clever child , "
11480	11488	11489	11489	she	22	" But you are clever in everything , "
11496	11508	11510	11510	she	22	" I dare say you can manage her . Go in . "
11598	11602	11603	11603	she	22	" Poor darling , "
11608	11618	11603	11603	she	22	" I know you have n't any mamma , poor "
11625	11661	11603	11603	she	22	" If you do n't stop , Lottie , I will shake you . Poor little angel ! There ! You wicked , bad , detestable child , I will smack you ! I will ! "
11707	11711	11712	11712	she	18	" Miss Amelia , "
11719	11733	11712	11712	she	18	" Miss Minchin says I may try to make her stop may I ? "
11743	11752	11753	11753	she	22	" Oh , DO you think you can ? "
11756	11764	11767	11767	Sara	18	" I do n't know whether I CAN "
11776	11782	11767	11767	Sara	18	" but I will try . "
11807	11817	11819	11819	Sara	18	" If you will steal out of the room , "
11821	11828	11819	11819	Sara	18	" I will stay with her . "
11829	11834	11837	11838	Miss Amelia	22	" Oh , Sara ! "
11840	11859	11837	11838	Miss Amelia	22	" We never had such a dreadful child before . I do n't believe we can keep her . "
12081	12092	12093	12093	she	47	" I have n't any ma ma ma - a ! "
12122	12127	12128	12128	she	18	" Neither have I , "
12235	12240	12222	12222	she	31	" Where is she ? "
12281	12287	12288	12288	she	18	" She went to heaven , "
12291	12330	12288	12288	she	18	" But I am sure she comes out sometimes to see me though I do n't see her . So does yours . Perhaps they can both see us now . Perhaps they are both in this room . "
12490	12499	12500	12500	she	18	" There are fields and fields of flowers , "
12524	12650	12500	12500	she	18	" fields and fields of lilies and when the soft wind blows over them it wafts the scent of them into the air and everybody always breathes it , because the soft wind is always blowing . And little children run about in the lily fields and gather armfuls of them , and laugh and make little wreaths . And the streets are shining . And people are never tired , however far they walk . They can float anywhere they like . And there are walls made of pearl and gold all round the city , but they are low enough for the people to go and lean on them , and look down onto the earth and smile , and send beautiful messages . "
12726	12733	12734	12734	she	31	" I want to go there , "
12737	12747	12734	12734	she	31	" I have n't any mamma in this school . "
12781	12788	12789	12789	she	18	" I will be your mamma , "
12792	12810	12789	12789	she	18	" We will play that you are my little girl . And Emily shall be your sister . "
12820	12824	12825	12825	she	18	" Shall she ? "
12828	12831	12833	12833	Sara	18	" Yes , "
12840	12860	12833	12833	Sara	18	" Let us go and tell her . And then I will wash your face and brush your hair . "
12960	12965	12958	12958	she	18	" the show pupil , "
13240	13247	13248	13248	she	18	" When I am telling it , "
13252	13299	13248	13248	she	18	" it does n't seem as if it was only made up . It seems more real than you are more real than the schoolroom . I feel as if I were all the people in the story one after the other . It is queer . "
13673	13701	13702	13702	she	18	" The Mermaids swam softly about in the crystal - green water , and dragged after them a fishing - net woven of deep - sea pearls , "
13705	13717	13702	13702	she	18	" The Princess sat on the white rock and watched them . "
13912	13919	13920	13920	she	30	" That girl has been listening , "
13961	13968	13969	13969	she	18	" I knew she was listening , "
13972	13978	13969	13969	she	18	" Why should n't she ? "
13987	13990	13991	13991	she	30	" Well , "
13994	14025	13991	13991	she	30	" I do not know whether your mamma would like you to tell stories to servant girls , but I know MY mamma would n't like ME to do it . "
14026	14030	14032	14032	Sara	18	" My mamma ! "
14037	14057	14032	14032	Sara	18	" I do n't believe she would mind in the least . She knows that stories belong to everybody . "
14058	14062	14064	14064	Lavinia	30	" I thought , "
14070	14083	14064	14064	Lavinia	30	" that your mamma was dead . How can she know things ? "
14084	14093	14095	14095	Sara	18	" Do you think she DOESN'T know things ? "
14112	14119	14122	14122	Lottie	31	" Sara 's mamma knows everything , "
14124	14174	14122	14122	Lottie	31	" So does my mamma ' cept Sara is my mamma at Miss Minchin 's my other one knows everything . The streets are shining , and there are fields and fields of lilies , and everybody gathers them . Sara tells me when she puts me to bed . "
14175	14180	14182	14182	Lavinia	30	" You wicked thing , "
14188	14195	14182	14182	Lavinia	30	" making fairy stories about heaven . "
14196	14206	14208	14208	Sara	18	" There are much more splendid stories in Revelation , "
14210	14230	14208	14208	Sara	18	" Just look and see ! How do you know mine are fairy stories ? But I can tell you "
14238	14266	14268	14268	she	18	" you will never find out whether they are or not if you 're not kinder to people than you are now . Come along , Lottie . "
14301	14312	14313	14313	she	18	" Who is that little girl who makes the fires ? "
14453	14459	14461	14461	Sara	18	" What is her name ? "
14498	14504	14492	14495	everyone below - stairs	509	" Becky , do this , "
14506	14512	14492	14495	everyone below - stairs	509	" Becky , do that , "
15310	15313	15315	15315	Sara	18	" Oh ! "
15324	15329	15320	15320	she	18	" That poor thing ! "
15401	15409	15410	15410	Sara	18	" I wish she 'd waken herself , "
15413	15441	15410	15410	Sara	18	" I do n't like to waken her . But Miss Minchin would be cross if she found out . I 'll just wait a few minutes . "
15496	15503	15504	15504	she	18	" But she is so tired , "
15507	15513	15504	15504	she	18	" She is so tired ! "
15679	15688	15689	15689	she	18	" Oh , miss ! Oh , miss ! "
15692	15707	15689	15689	she	18	" I arst yer pardon , miss ! Oh , I do , miss ! "
15719	15725	15726	15726	she	18	" Do n't be frightened , "
15743	15752	15726	15726	she	18	" It does n't matter the least bit . "
15753	15764	15766	15766	Becky	48	" I did n't go to do it , miss , "
15768	15787	15766	15766	Becky	48	" It was the warm fire an ' me bein ' so tired . It it WASN'T impertience ! "
15804	15809	15810	15810	she	18	" You were tired , "
15813	15827	15810	15810	she	18	" you could not help it . You are not really awake yet . "
15930	15940	15941	15941	she	18	" Ai n't ai n't yer angry , miss ? "
15944	15954	15941	15941	she	18	" Ai n't yer goin' to tell the missus ? "
15955	15958	15961	15961	Sara	18	" No , "
15963	15970	15961	15961	Sara	18	" Of course I 'm not . "
16011	16014	16015	16015	she	18	" Why , "
16018	16050	16015	16015	she	18	" we are just the same I am only a little girl like you . It 's just an accident that I am not you , and you are not me ! "
16069	16072	16059	16059	Her	48	" an accident "
16094	16099	16137	16137	she	18	" the ' orspital . "
16100	16107	16108	16108	she	48	" A ' accident , miss , "
16112	16116	16108	16108	she	48	" Is it ? "
16117	16120	16121	16121	Sara	18	" Yes , "
16155	16162	16163	16163	she	18	" Have you done your work ? "
16166	16175	16163	16163	she	18	" Dare you stay here a few minutes ? "
16182	16189	16152	16152	she	18	" Here , miss ? Me ? "
16205	16212	16213	16213	she	18	" No one is anywhere about , "
16216	16242	16213	16213	she	18	" If your bedrooms are finished , perhaps you might stay a tiny while . I thought perhaps you might like a piece of cake . "
16324	16327	16328	16328	she	48	" Is that "
16349	16356	16341	16341	she	48	" Is that there your best ? "
16357	16367	16369	16369	Sara	18	" It is one of my dancing - frocks , "
16371	16380	16369	16369	Sara	18	" I like it , do n't you ? "
16400	16506	16393	16393	she	48	" Onct I see a princess . I was standin ' in the street with the crowd outside Covin ' Garden , watchin ' the swells go inter the operer . An ' there was one everyone stared at most . They ses to each other , ' That 's the princess . ' She was a growed - up young lady , but she was pink all over gownd an ' cloak , an ' flowers an ' all . I called her to mind the minnit I see you , sittin ' there on the table , miss . You looked like her . "
16507	16513	16515	16515	Sara	18	" I 've often thought , "
16522	16549	16515	16515	Sara	18	" that I should like to be a princess ; I wonder what it feels like . I believe I will begin pretending I am one . "
16593	16596	16597	16597	she	18	" Becky , "
16600	16609	16597	16597	she	18	" were n't you listening to that story ? "
16610	16615	16617	16617	Becky	48	" Yes , miss , "
16624	16644	16617	16617	Becky	48	" I knowed I had n't orter , but it was that beautiful I I could n't help it . "
16645	16654	16656	16656	Sara	18	" I liked you to listen to it , "
16658	16696	16656	16656	Sara	18	" If you tell stories , you like nothing so much as to tell them to people who want to listen . I do n't know why it is . Would you like to hear the rest ? "
16703	16708	16709	16709	she	48	" Me hear it ? "
16712	16743	16709	16709	she	48	" Like as if I was a pupil , miss ! All about the Prince and the little white Mer - babies swimming about laughing with stars in their hair ? "
16747	16761	16762	16762	she	18	" You have n't time to hear it now , I 'm afraid , "
16765	16818	16762	16762	she	18	" but if you will tell me just what time you come to do my rooms , I will try to be here and tell you a bit of it every day until it is finished . It 's a lovely long one and I 'm always putting new bits to it . "
16819	16822	16824	16824	Becky	48	" Then , "

16995	17057	16992	16992	she	18	" I could scatter largess to the populace . But even if I am only a pretend princess , I can invent little things to do for people . Things like this . She was just as happy as if it was largess . I 'll pretend that to do things people like is scattering largess . I 've scattered largess . "

17378	17407	17375	17375	she	30	" And it is not a big one , either . If there were mines full of diamonds , people would be so rich it would be ridiculous . "
17408	17421	17423	17423	Jessie	33	" Perhaps Sara will be so rich that she will be ridiculous , "
17425	17433	17434	17434	Lavinia	30	" She 's ridiculous without being rich , "
17437	17444	17446	17446	Jessie	33	" I believe you hate her , "

17531	17587	17485	17485	Jessie	33	" Well , it is . One of her ' pretends ' is that she is a princess . She plays it all the time even in school . She says it makes her learn her lessons better . She wants Ermengarde to be one , too , but Ermengarde says she is too fat . "
17588	17594	17596	17596	Lavinia	30	" She IS too fat , "

17612	17647	17608	17608	Jessie	33	" She says it has nothing to do with what you look like , or what you have . It has only to do with what you THINK of , and what you DO . "
17648	17664	17666	17666	Lavinia	30	" I suppose she thinks she could be a princess if she was a beggar , "

18134	18159	18126	18126	Sara	18	" And as if I want to hit back . I have to remember things quickly to keep from saying something ill - tempered . "

18681	18719	18654	18654	she	18	" At least I both want to slap you and I should LIKE to slap you but I WON'T slap you . We are not little gutter children . We are both old enough to know better . "

18739	18771	18736	18736	she	30	" We are princesses , I believe . At least one of us is . The school ought to be very fashionable now Miss Minchin has a princess for a pupil . "

19568	19596	19566	19566	Sara	18	" I suppose you might make friends with a rat in time , but I do n't believe I should like to make friends with a cockroach . "

If I could write poetry , I am sure a poem about ' A Last Doll ' would be very nice . But I can not write poetry . I have tried , and it made me laugh . It did not sound like Watts or Coleridge or Shakespeare at all . No one could ever take Emily 's place , but I should respect the Last Doll very much ; and I am sure the school would love it . They all like dolls , though some of the big ones the almost fifteen ones pretend they are too grown up . "

' My reply was , ' Her education at my seminary , Captain Crewe , shall be such as will adorn the largest fortune . ' Sara has become my most accomplished pupil . Her French and her dancing are a credit to the seminary . Her manners which have caused you to call her Princess Sara are perfect . Her amiability she exhibits by giving you this afternoon 's party . I hope you appreciate her generosity . I wish you to express your appreciation of it by saying aloud all together , ' Thank you , Sara ! ' "

23134	23169	23130	23130	Sara	18	" I like it . There is nothing so nice as supposing . It 's almost like being a fairy . If you suppose anything hard enough it seems as if it were real . "

23738	23747	23748	23748	she	22	" I beg your pardon , Mr. Barrow , "
23752	23758	23748	23748	she	22	" I do not understand . "
23759	23763	23765	23766	Mr. Barrow	66	" Birthday presents , "
23773	23788	23765	23766	Mr. Barrow	66	" to a child eleven years old ! Mad extravagance , I call it . "
23798	23807	23808	23808	she	22	" Captain Crewe is a man of fortune , "
23811	23816	23808	23808	she	22	" The diamond mines alone "
23824	23828	23829	23829	he	66	" Diamond mines ! "
23833	23841	23829	23829	he	66	" There are none ! Never were ! "
23851	23854	23855	23855	she	22	" What ! "
23858	23864	23855	23855	she	22	" What do you mean ? "
23865	23870	23872	23873	Mr. Barrow	66	" At any rate , "
23878	23892	23872	23873	Mr. Barrow	66	" it would have been much better if there never had been any . "
23893	23898	23900	23901	Miss Minchin	22	" Any diamond mines ? "
23923	23934	23936	23937	Mr. Barrow	66	" Diamond mines spell ruin oftener than they spell wealth , "
23939	23995	23936	23937	Mr. Barrow	66	" When a man is in the hands of a very dear friend and is not a businessman himself , he had better steer clear of the dear friend 's diamond mines , or gold mines , or any other kind of mines dear friends want his money to put into . The late Captain Crewe "
24005	24011	24012	24012	she	22	" The LATE Captain Crewe ! "
24016	24031	24012	24012	she	22	" The LATE ! You do n't come to tell me that Captain Crewe is "
24032	24039	24040	24041	Mr. Barrow	66	" He 's dead , ma'am , "
24047	24102	24040	24041	Mr. Barrow	66	" Died of jungle fever and business troubles combined . The jungle fever might not have killed him if he had not been driven mad by the business troubles , and the business troubles might not have put an end to him if the jungle fever had not assisted . Captain Crewe is dead ! "
24121	24128	24129	24129	she	22	" What WERE his business troubles ? "
24132	24137	24129	24129	she	22	" What WERE they ? "
24138	24142	24144	24145	Mr. Barrow	66	" Diamond mines , "
24147	24154	24144	24145	Mr. Barrow	66	" and dear friends and ruin . "
24161	24164	24165	24165	she	22	" Ruin ! "
24169	24252	24155	24156	Miss Minchin	22	" Lost every penny . That young man had too much money . The dear friend was mad on the subject of the diamond mine . He put all his own money into it , and all Captain Crewe 's . Then the dear friend ran away Captain Crewe was already stricken with fever when the news came . The shock was too much for him . He died delirious , raving about his little girl and did n't leave a penny . "
24313	24321	24322	24322	she	22	" Do you mean to tell me , "
24326	24361	24322	24322	she	22	" that he left NOTHING ! That Sara will have no fortune ! That the child is a beggar ! That she is left on my hands a little pauper instead of an heiress ? "
24387	24395	24396	24396	he	66	" She is certainly left a beggar , "
24399	24424	24396	24396	he	66	" And she is certainly left on your hands , ma'am as she has n't a relation in the world that we know of . "
24463	24468	24469	24469	she	22	" It is monstrous ! "
24472	24498	24469	24469	she	22	" She 's in my sitting room at this moment , dressed in silk gauze and lace petticoats , giving a party at my expense . "
24499	24516	24518	24519	Mr. Barrow	66	" She 's giving it at your expense , madam , if she 's giving it , "
24523	24560	24518	24519	Mr. Barrow	66	" Barrow Skipworth are not responsible for anything . There never was a cleaner sweep made of a man 's fortune . Captain Crewe died without paying OUR last bill and it was a big one . "
24584	24593	24594	24594	she	22	" That is what has happened to me ! "
24597	24667	24594	24594	she	22	" I was always so sure of his payments that I went to all sorts of ridiculous expenses for the child . I paid the bills for that ridiculous doll and her ridiculous fantastic wardrobe . The child was to have anything she wanted . She has a carriage and a pony and a maid , and I 've paid for all of them since the last cheque came . "
24717	24729	24730	24730	he	66	" You had better not pay for anything more , ma'am , "
24733	24762	24730	24730	he	66	" unless you want to make presents to the young lady . No one will remember you . She has n't a brass farthing to call her own . "
24763	24771	24773	24774	Miss Minchin	22	" But what am I to do ? "
24790	24797	24778	24778	she	22	" What am I to do ? "
24798	24806	24808	24809	Mr. Barrow	66	" There is n't anything to do , "
24822	24843	24808	24809	Mr. Barrow	66	" Captain Crewe is dead . The child is left a pauper . Nobody is responsible for her but you . "
24844	24860	24778	24778	she	22	" I am not responsible for her , and I refuse to be made responsible ! "
24875	24886	24887	24887	he	66	" I have nothing to do with that , madam , "
24891	24908	24887	24887	he	66	" Barrow Skipworth are not responsible . Very sorry the thing has happened , of course . "
24909	24927	24928	24929	Miss Minchin	22	" If you think she is to be foisted off on me , you are greatly mistaken , "
24932	24948	24928	24929	Miss Minchin	22	" I have been robbed and cheated ; I will turn her into the street ! "
25002	25011	25012	25012	he	66	" I would n't do that , madam , "
25015	25041	25012	25012	he	66	" it would n't look well . Unpleasant story to get about in connection with the establishment . Pupil bundled out penniless and without friends . "
25100	25110	25111	25111	he	66	" Better keep her and make use of her , "
25114	25138	25111	25111	he	66	" She 's a clever child , I believe . You can get a good deal out of her as she grows older . "
25139	25154	25156	25157	Miss Minchin	22	" I will get a good deal out of her before she grows older ! "
25159	25168	25170	25171	Mr. Barrow	66	" I am sure you will , ma'am , "
25179	25189	25170	25171	Mr. Barrow	66	" I am sure you will . Good morning ! "
25346	25354	25355	25355	she	22	" What IS the matter , sister ? "
25369	25375	25366	25366	she	22	" Where is Sara Crewe ? "
25381	25384	25385	25385	she	22	" Sara ! "
25388	25403	25385	25385	she	22	" Why , she 's with the children in your room , of course . "
25404	25415	25366	25366	she	22	" Has she a black frock in her sumptuous wardrobe ? "
25420	25425	25426	25427	Miss Amelia	22	" A black frock ? "
25431	25436	25426	25427	Miss Amelia	22	" A BLACK one ? "
25437	25452	25426	25427	Miss Amelia	22	" She has frocks of every other color . Has she a black one ? "
25460	25466	25467	25467	she	22	" No ye - es ! "
25470	25493	25467	25467	she	22	" But it is too short for her . She has only the old black velvet , and she has outgrown it . "
25494	25529	25426	25427	Miss Amelia	22	" Go and tell her to take off that preposterous pink silk gauze , and put the black one on , whether it is too short or not . She has done with finery ! "
25542	25547	25548	25548	she	22	" Oh , sister ! "
25551	25561	25548	25548	she	22	" Oh , sister ! What CAN have happened ? "
25568	25574	25575	25575	she	22	" Captain Crewe is dead , "
25578	25601	25575	25575	she	22	" He has died without a penny . That spoiled , pampered , fanciful child is left a pauper on my hands . "
25613	25655	25575	25575	she	22	" Hundreds of pounds have I spent on nonsense for her . And I shall never see a penny of it . Put a stop to this ridiculous party of hers . Go and make her change her frock at once . "
25656	25659	25661	25662	Miss Amelia	22	" I ? "
25664	25675	25661	25662	Miss Amelia	22	" M - must I go and tell her now ? "
25676	25680	25575	25575	she	22	" This moment ! "
25686	25697	25575	25575	she	22	" Do n't sit staring like a goose . Go ! "
25946	25953	25954	25954	she	22	" The Princess Sara , indeed ! "
25957	25970	25971	25971	She	22	" The child has been pampered as if she were a QUEEN . "
26006	26011	26012	26012	she	22	" What is that ! "
26038	26043	26044	26044	she	22	" How DARE you ! "
26048	26057	26044	26044	she	22	" How dare you ! Come out immediately ! "
26084	26097	26098	26098	she	22	" If you please , ' m it 's me , mum , "
26101	26136	26098	26098	she	22	" I know I had n't ought to . But I was lookin ' at the doll , mum an ' I was frightened when you come in an ' slipped under the table . "
26137	26148	26150	26151	Miss Minchin	22	" You have been there all the time , listening , "
26153	26158	26159	26159	Becky	48	" No , mum , "
26165	26212	26159	26159	Becky	48	" Not listenin ' I thought I could slip out without your noticin ' , but I could n't an ' I had to stay . But I did n't listen , mum I would n't for nothin' . But I could n't help hearin ' . "
26236	26244	26245	26245	she	48	" Oh , please , ' m , "
26248	26274	26245	26245	she	48	" I dare say you 'll give me warnin ' , mum but I 'm so sorry for poor Miss Sara I 'm so sorry ! "
26275	26280	26282	26283	Miss Minchin	22	" Leave the room ! "
26297	26309	26310	26310	she	48	" Yes , ' m ; I will , ' m , "
26315	26408	26310	26310	she	48	" but oh , I just wanted to arst you : Miss Sara she 's been such a rich young lady , an ' she 's been waited on , ' and and foot ; an ' what will she do now , mum , without no maid ? If if , oh please , would you let me wait on her after I 've done my pots an ' kettles ? I 'd do 'em that quick if you 'd let me wait on her now she 's poor . Oh , "
26413	26426	26310	26310	she	48	" poor little Miss Sara , mum that was called a princess . "
26475	26480	26481	26481	she	702	" No certainly not , "
26484	26511	26481	26481	she	702	" She will wait on herself , and on other people , too . Leave the room this instant , or you 'll leave your place . "
26556	26567	26568	26568	she	48	" It 's exactly like the ones in the stories , "
26571	26583	26568	26568	she	48	" Them pore princess ones that was drove into the world . "
26750	26759	26760	26761	Miss Minchin	22	" Tell Sara to come to my room , "
26768	26784	26760	26761	Miss Minchin	22	" And explain to her clearly that I will have no crying or unpleasant scenes . "
26785	26788	26790	26791	Miss Amelia	22	" Sister , "
26957	26957	26949	26949	people	157	"

27044	27068	27026	27026	she	18	" Emily ! Do you hear ? Do you hear papa is dead ? He is dead in India thousands of miles away . "
27254	27260	27262	27263	Miss Minchin	22	" Put down your doll , "
27265	27275	27262	27263	Miss Minchin	22	" What do you mean by bringing her here ? "
27276	27279	27280	27280	Sara	18	" No , "
27283	27304	27280	27280	Sara	18	" I will not put her down . She is all I have . My papa gave her to me . "
27356	27367	27368	27368	she	22	" You will have no time for dolls in future , "
27371	27385	27368	27368	she	22	" You will have to work and improve yourself and make yourself useful . "
27403	27411	27412	27413	Miss Minchin	22	" Everything will be very different now , "
27417	27428	27412	27413	Miss Minchin	22	" I suppose Miss Amelia has explained matters to you . "
27429	27432	27434	27434	Sara	18	" Yes , "
27436	27453	27434	27434	Sara	18	" My papa is dead . He left me no money . I am quite poor . "
27454	27460	27462	27463	Miss Minchin	22	" You are a beggar , "
27477	27498	27462	27463	Miss Minchin	22	" It appears that you have no relations and no home , and no one to take care of you . "
27516	27523	27525	27526	Miss Minchin	22	" What are you staring at ? "
27530	27574	27525	27526	Miss Minchin	22	" Are you so stupid that you can not understand ? I tell you that you are quite alone in the world , and have no one to do anything for you , unless I choose to keep you here out of charity . "
27575	27579	27581	27581	Sara	18	" I understand , "
27606	27610	27595	27595	she	18	" I understand . "
27611	27615	27617	27618	Miss Minchin	22	" That doll , "
27628	27648	27595	27595	she	18	" that ridiculous doll , with all her nonsensical , extravagant things I actually paid the bill for her ! "

27694	27709	27691	27692	Miss Minchin	22	" And she is mine , not yours . Everything you own is mine . "
27710	27720	27722	27722	Sara	18	" Please take it away from me , then , "
27724	27731	27722	27722	Sara	18	" I do not want it . "
27797	27805	27806	27806	she	18	" Do n't put on grand airs , "
27809	27873	27806	27806	she	18	" The time for that sort of thing is past . You are not a princess any longer . Your carriage and your pony will be sent away your maid will be dismissed . You will wear your oldest and plainest clothes your extravagant ones are no longer suited to your station . You are like Becky you must work for your living . "
27894	27899	27900	27900	she	18	" Can I work ? "
27903	27920	27900	27900	she	18	" If I can work it will not matter so much . What can I do ? "
27921	27930	27885	27886	the child	261	" You can do anything you are told , "
27935	27974	27885	27886	the child	261	" You are a sharp child , and pick up things readily . If you make yourself useful I may let you stay here . You speak French well , and you can help with the younger children . "
27975	27979	27981	27981	Sara	18	" May I ? "
27983	28006	27981	27981	Sara	18	" Oh , please let me ! I know I can teach them . I like them , and they like me . "
28007	28017	28019	28020	Miss Minchin	22	" Do n't talk nonsense about people liking you , "
28022	28070	28019	28020	Miss Minchin	22	" You will have to do more than teach the little ones . You will run errands and help in the kitchen as well as in the schoolroom . If you do n't please me , you will be sent away . Remember that . Now go . "
28103	28106	28108	28109	Miss Minchin	22	" Stop ! "
28111	28120	28108	28109	Miss Minchin	22	" Do n't you intend to thank me ? "

28145	28152	28154	28155	Miss Minchin	22	" For my kindness to you , "
28157	28167	28154	28155	Miss Minchin	22	" For my kindness in giving you a home . "
28198	28204	28205	28205	she	22	" You are not kind , "

29549	29597	29546	29546	she	22	" by taking your seat with the younger children at a smaller table . You must keep them quiet , and see that they behave well and do not waste their food . You ought to have been down earlier . Lottie has already upset her tea . "

30203	30275	30199	30200	that lady	780	" Girls like a grievance , and if she begins to tell romantic stories about herself , she will become an ill - used heroine , and parents will be given a wrong impression . It is better that she should live a separate life one suited to her circumstances . I am giving her a home , and that is more than she has any right to expect from me . "
30412	30425	30426	30426	Lavinia	30	" To think that she was the girl with the diamond mines , "
30429	30474	30426	30426	Lavinia	30	" She does look an object . And she 's queerer than ever . I never liked her much , but I ca n't bear that way she has now of looking at people without speaking just as if she was finding them out . "
30475	30479	30481	30481	Sara	18	" I am , "
30491	30515	30481	30481	Sara	18	" That 's what I look at some people for . I like to know about them . I think them over afterward . "
30653	30659	30660	30660	she	18	" Soldiers do n't complain , "
30670	30689	30660	30660	she	18	" I am not going to do it ; I will pretend this is part of a war . "
30813	30821	30822	30822	Becky	48	" Do n't mind me , miss , "
30829	30876	30822	30822	Becky	48	" if I do n't say nothin' polite . Some un'd be down on us if I did . I MEANS ' please ' an ' ' thank you ' an ' ' beg pardon , ' but I dassn't to take time to say it . "
31341	31350	31320	31320	she	40	" Oh , Sara , is that you ? "
31351	31354	31356	31356	Sara	18	" Yes , "
31456	31459	31460	31460	she	40	" Oh , "
31463	31469	31460	31460	she	40	" How how are you ? "
31470	31476	31477	31477	Sara	18	" I do n't know , "
31480	31485	31477	31477	Sara	18	" How are you ? "
31486	31494	31496	31496	Ermengarde	40	" I 'm I 'm quite well , "
31515	31523	31524	31524	she	40	" Are you are you very unhappy ? "
31569	31575	31576	31576	she	18	" What do you think ? "
31579	31588	31576	31576	she	18	" Do you think I am very happy ? "
31672	31679	31680	31680	she	18	" She is like the others , "
31684	31701	31680	31680	she	18	" She does not really want to talk to me . She knows no one does . "
31755	31765	31766	31766	Sara	18	" If she would rather not talk to me , "
31769	31785	31766	31766	Sara	18	" I will keep out of her way . Miss Minchin makes that easy enough . "
31863	31872	31873	31873	she	33	" What are you crying for , Ermengarde ? "
31876	31882	31884	31884	Ermengarde	40	" I 'm not crying , "
31893	31897	31899	31899	Jessie	33	" You are , "
31901	31928	31899	31899	Jessie	33	" A great big tear just rolled down the bridge of your nose and dropped off at the end of it . And there goes another . "
31929	31932	31934	31934	Ermengarde	40	" Well , "
31936	31946	31948	31948	she	40	" I 'm miserable and no one need interfere . "
32039	32046	32047	32047	she	18	" Nobody goes there but myself , "
32051	32059	32047	32047	she	18	" but someone has lighted a candle . "
32123	32126	32128	32128	Sara	18	" Ermengarde ! "
32140	32147	32135	32135	she	18	" You will get into trouble . "
32181	32192	32193	32193	she	40	" I know I shall if I 'm found out . "
32196	32231	32193	32193	she	40	" But I do n't care I do n't care a bit . Oh , Sara , please tell me . What is the matter ? Why do n't you like me any more ? "
32263	32267	32272	32272	she	40	" best friends . "
32287	32293	32294	32294	Sara	18	" I do like you , "
32297	32314	32294	32294	Sara	18	" I thought you see , everything is different now . I thought you were different . "
32322	32332	32333	32333	she	40	" Why , it was you who were different ! "
32336	32365	32333	32333	she	40	" You did n't want to talk to me . I did n't know what to do . It was you who were different after I came back . "
32379	32384	32385	32385	she	40	" I AM different , "
32388	32437	32385	32385	she	40	" though not in the way you think . Miss Minchin does not want me to talk to the girls . Most of them do n't want to talk to me . I thought perhaps you did n't . So I tried to keep out of your way . "
32438	32443	32444	32444	Ermengarde	40	" Oh , Sara , "
32541	32550	32551	32551	she	40	" I could n't bear it any more , "
32554	32610	32551	32551	she	40	" I dare say you could live without me , Sara ; but I could n't live without you . I was nearly DEAD . So tonight , when I was crying under the bedclothes , I thought all at once of creeping up here and just begging you to let us be friends again . "
32611	32619	32621	32621	Sara	18	" You are nicer than I am , "
32623	32661	32621	32621	Sara	18	" I was too proud to try and make friends . You see , now that trials have come , they have shown that I am NOT a nice child . I was afraid they would . Perhaps "
32666	32675	32551	32551	she	40	" that is what they were sent for . "
32676	32686	32688	32688	Ermengarde	40	" I do n't see any good in them , "
32691	32700	32702	32702	Sara	18	" Neither do I to speak the truth , "
32706	32727	32702	32702	Sara	18	" But I suppose there MIGHT be good in things , even if we do n't see it . There MIGHT "
32729	32736	32551	32551	she	40	" be good in Miss Minchin . "
32748	32751	32752	32752	she	40	" Sara , "
32755	32765	32752	32752	she	40	" do you think you can bear living here ? "
32771	32783	32784	32784	she	18	" If I pretend it 's quite different , I can , "
32787	32800	32784	32784	she	18	" or if I pretend it is a place in a story . "
32840	32873	32891	32891	She	40	" Other people have lived in worse places . Think of the Count of Monte Cristo in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If . And think of the people in the Bastille ! "
32874	32878	32881	32881	Ermengarde	40	" The Bastille , "
32935	32938	32939	32939	she	18	" Yes , "
32946	32990	32939	32939	she	18	" that will be a good place to pretend about . I am a prisoner in the Bastille . I have been here for years and years and years ; and everybody has forgotten about me . Miss Minchin is the jailer and Becky "
33002	33012	33013	33013	She	18	" Becky is the prisoner in the next cell . "
33025	33031	33032	33032	she	18	" I shall pretend that , "
33035	33044	33032	33032	she	18	" and it will be a great comfort . "
33053	33063	33064	33064	she	40	" And will you tell me all about it ? "
33067	33108	33064	33064	she	40	" May I creep up here at night , whenever it is safe , and hear the things you have made up in the day ? It will seem as if we were more ' best friends ' than ever . "
33109	33112	33114	33114	Sara	18	" Yes , "
33118	33135	33114	33114	Sara	18	" Adversity tries people , and mine has tried you and proved how nice you are . "
33289	33298	33299	33299	she	31	" Are you very poor now , Sara ? "
33316	33325	33326	33326	She	31	" Are you as poor as a beggar ? "
33342	33356	33326	33326	She	31	" I do n't want you to be as poor as a beggar . "
33373	33380	33381	33381	she	31	" Beggars have nowhere to live , "
33385	33394	33381	33381	she	31	" I have a place to live in . "
33395	33401	33403	33403	Lottie	31	" Where do you live ? "
33405	33422	33403	33403	Lottie	31	" The new girl sleeps in your room , and it is n't pretty any more . "
33423	33430	33432	33432	Sara	18	" I live in another room , "
33434	33441	33443	33443	Lottie	31	" Is it a nice one ? "
33445	33454	33443	33443	Lottie	31	" I want to go and see it . "
33455	33461	33463	33463	Sara	18	" You must not talk , "
33465	33484	33463	33463	Sara	18	" Miss Minchin is looking at us . She will be angry with me for letting you whisper . "
33643	33646	33647	33647	she	18	" Sara ! "
33652	33656	33647	33647	she	18	" Mamma Sara ! "
33743	33752	33753	33753	she	18	" Do n't cry and make a noise , "
33756	33785	33753	33753	she	18	" I shall be scolded if you do , and I have been scolded all day . It 's it 's not such a bad room , Lottie . "
33786	33791	33793	33793	Lottie	31	" Is n't it ? "
33855	33863	33864	33864	she	31	" Why is n't it , Sara ? "
33911	33925	33926	33926	she	31	" You can see all sorts of things you ca n't see downstairs , "
33929	33935	33937	33937	Lottie	31	" What sort of things ? "
33951	34020	33937	33937	Lottie	31	" Chimneys quite close to us with smoke curling up in wreaths and clouds and going up into the sky and sparrows hopping about and talking to each other just as if they were people and other attic windows where heads may pop out any minute and you can wonder who they belong to . And it all feels as high up as if it was another world . "
34021	34029	34031	34031	Lottie	31	" Oh , let me see it ! "
34033	34038	34031	34031	Lottie	31	" Lift me up ! "
34161	34168	34169	34169	Sara	18	" I wish someone lived there , "
34172	34213	34169	34169	Sara	18	" It is so close that if there was a little girl in the attic , we could talk to each other through the windows and climb over to see each other , if we were not afraid of falling . "
34289	34294	34296	34296	Lottie	31	" Oh , Sara ! "
34304	34319	34296	34296	Lottie	31	" I like this attic I like it ! It is nicer than downstairs ! "
34320	34326	34328	34328	Sara	18	" Look at that sparrow , "
34330	34342	34328	34328	Sara	18	" I wish I had some crumbs to throw to him . "
34343	34348	34355	34355	Lottie	31	" I have some ! "
34357	34382	34355	34355	Lottie	31	" I have part of a bun in my pocket ; I bought it with my penny yesterday , and I saved a bit . "
34482	34491	34492	34492	she	18	" Will he come ? Will he come ? "
34495	34504	34505	34505	Sara	18	" His eyes look as if he would , "
34509	34530	34505	34505	Sara	18	" He is thinking and thinking whether he dare . Yes , he will ! Yes , he is coming ! "
34625	34629	34632	34632	Sara	18	" Now he KNOWS "
34634	34644	34632	34632	Sara	18	" And he will come back for the others . "
34762	34773	34774	34774	she	18	" It is so little and so high above everything , "
34777	34958	34774	34774	she	18	" that it is almost like a nest in a tree . The slanting ceiling is so funny . See , you can scarcely stand up at this end of the room ; and when the morning begins to come I can lie in bed and look right up into the sky through that flat window in the roof . It is like a square patch of light . If the sun is going to shine , little pink clouds float about , and I feel as if I could touch them . And if it rains , the drops patter and patter as if they were saying something nice . Then if there are stars , you can lie and try to count how many go into the patch . It takes such a lot . And just look at that tiny , rusty grate in the corner . If it was polished and there was a fire in it , just think how nice it would be . You see , it 's really a beautiful little room . "
35006	35010	35011	35011	she	18	" You see , "
35014	35201	35011	35011	she	18	" there could be a thick , soft blue Indian rug on the floor ; and in that corner there could be a soft little sofa , with cushions to curl up on ; and just over it could be a shelf full of books so that one could reach them easily ; and there could be a fur rug before the fire , and hangings on the wall to cover up the whitewash , and pictures . They would have to be little ones , but they could be beautiful ; and there could be a lamp with a deep rose - colored shade ; and a table in the middle , with things to have tea with ; and a little fat copper kettle singing on the hob ; and the bed could be quite different . It could be made soft and covered with a lovely silk coverlet . It could be beautiful . And perhaps we could coax the sparrows until we made such friends with them that they would come and peck at the window and ask to be let in . "
35202	35207	35209	35209	Lottie	31	" Oh , Sara ! "
35211	35219	35209	35209	Lottie	31	" I should like to live here ! "
35375	35382	35383	35383	she	18	" It 's a lonely place , "
35386	35397	35383	35383	she	18	" Sometimes it 's the loneliest place in the world . "
35545	35558	35559	35559	she	18	" I dare say it is rather hard to be a rat , "
35562	35661	35559	35559	she	18	" Nobody likes you . People jump and run away and scream out , ' Oh , a horrid rat ! ' I should n't like people to scream and jump and say , ' Oh , a horrid Sara ! ' the moment they saw me . And set traps for me , and pretend they were dinner . It 's so different to be a sparrow . But nobody asked this rat if he wanted to be a rat when he was made . Nobody said , ' Would n't you rather be a sparrow ? ' "
35763	35767	35769	35769	Sara	18	" Come on , "
35771	35804	35769	35769	Sara	18	" I 'm not a trap . You can have them , poor thing ! Prisoners in the Bastille used to make friends with rats . Suppose I make friends with you . "
36119	36134	36135	36135	Sara	18	" I believe he wants it to carry to his family in the wall , "
36138	36155	36135	36135	Sara	18	" If I do not stir at all , perhaps he will come and get it . "
36246	36256	36258	36258	Sara	18	" I knew he wanted it for his children , "
36260	36271	36258	36258	Sara	18	" I do believe I could make friends with him . "
36364	36367	36370	36370	her	40	" There ! "
36373	36388	36370	36370	her	40	" Take it and go home , Melchisedec ! Go home to your wife ! "
36412	36422	36423	36423	she	40	" Who who ARE you talking to , Sara ? "
36444	36466	36467	36467	she	18	" You must promise not to be frightened not to scream the least bit , or I ca n't tell you , "
36512	36521	36522	36522	she	18	" Is it something that will frighten me ? "
36526	36534	36536	36536	Sara	18	" Some people are afraid of them , "
36538	36549	36536	36536	Sara	18	" I was at first but I am not now . "
36550	36556	36558	36558	Ermengarde	40	" Was it a ghost ? "
36560	36563	36565	36565	Sara	18	" No , "
36569	36575	36565	36565	Sara	18	" It was my rat . "
36615	36620	36621	36621	she	40	" Oh ! Oh ! "
36627	36634	36624	36624	her	40	" A rat ! A rat ! "
36635	36644	36646	36646	Sara	18	" I was afraid you would be frightened , "
36648	36683	36646	36646	Sara	18	" But you need n't be . I am making him tame . He actually knows me and comes out when I call him . Are you too frightened to want to see him ? "
36806	36823	36824	36824	she	40	" He he wo n't run out quickly and jump on the bed , will he ? "
36827	36830	36832	36832	Sara	18	" No , "
36834	36853	36832	36832	Sara	18	" He 's as polite as we are . He is just like a person . Now watch ! "
36970	36974	36976	36976	Sara	18	" You see , "
36978	37041	36976	36976	Sara	18	" that is for his wife and children . He is very nice . He only eats the little bits . After he goes back I can always hear his family squeaking for joy . There are three kinds of squeaks . One kind is the children 's , and one is Mrs. Melchisedec 's , and one is Melchisedec 's own . "
37047	37052	37053	37053	she	40	" Oh , Sara ! "
37056	37065	37053	37053	she	40	" You ARE queer but you are nice . "
37066	37073	37075	37075	Sara	18	" I know I am queer , "
37079	37087	37075	37075	Sara	18	" and I TRY to be nice . "
37109	37116	37117	37117	she	40	" Papa always laughed at me , "
37120	37163	37117	37117	she	40	" but I liked it . He thought I was queer , but he liked me to make up things . I I ca n't help making up things . If I did n't , I do n't believe I could live . "
37172	37182	37183	37183	she	40	" I 'm sure I could n't live here , "
37199	37206	37207	37207	she	40	" When you talk about things , "
37210	37230	37207	37207	she	40	" they seem as if they grew real . You talk about Melchisedec as if he was a person . "
37231	37237	37239	37239	Sara	18	" He IS a person , "
37241	37295	37239	37239	Sara	18	" He gets hungry and frightened , just as we do ; and he is married and has children . How do we know he does n't think things , just as we do ? His eyes look as if he was a person . That was why I gave him a name . "
37311	37314	37315	37315	she	40	" Besides , "
37318	37353	37315	37315	she	40	" he is a Bastille rat sent to be my friend . I can always get a bit of bread the cook has thrown away , and it is quite enough to support him . "
37354	37361	37363	37363	Ermengarde	40	" Is it the Bastille yet ? "
37367	37377	37363	37363	Ermengarde	40	" Do you always pretend it is the Bastille ? "
37378	37382	37384	37384	Sara	18	" Nearly always , "
37386	37411	37384	37384	Sara	18	" Sometimes I try to pretend it is another kind of place ; but the Bastille is generally easiest particularly when it is cold . "
37443	37448	37449	37449	she	40	" What is that ? "
37463	37473	37452	37452	Sara	18	" It is the prisoner in the next cell . "
37474	37477	37479	37479	Ermengarde	40	" Becky ! "
37483	37486	37488	37488	Sara	18	" Yes , "
37490	37506	37488	37488	Sara	18	" Listen ; the two knocks meant , ' Prisoner , are you there ? ' "
37521	37538	37507	37507	She	40	" That means , ' Yes , I am here , and all is well . ' "
37550	37554	37556	37556	Sara	18	" That means , "
37558	37576	37556	37556	Sara	18	" ' Then , fellow - sufferer , we will sleep in peace . Good night . ' "
37583	37588	37589	37589	she	40	" Oh , Sara ! "
37593	37600	37589	37589	she	40	" It is like a story ! "
37601	37607	37609	37609	Sara	18	" It IS a story , "
37611	37632	37609	37609	Sara	18	" EVERYTHING 'S a story . You are a story I am a story . Miss Minchin is a story . "
38923	38930	38931	38931	he	80	" Here , poor little girl , "
38934	38947	38931	38931	he	80	" Here is a sixpence . I will give it to you . "
39024	39029	39030	39030	she	18	" Oh , no ! "
39033	39049	39030	39030	she	18	" Oh , no , thank you ; I must n't take it , indeed ! "
39117	39129	39130	39130	he	80	" Yes , you must take it , poor little girl ! "
39134	39150	39130	39130	he	80	" You can buy things to eat with it . It is a whole sixpence ! "
39218	39222	39223	39223	she	18	" Thank you , "
39226	39237	39223	39223	she	18	" You are a kind , kind little darling thing . "
39314	39319	39322	39323	Guy Clarence	80	" Oh , Donald , "
39331	39351	39327	39327	Janet	83	" why did you offer that little girl your sixpence ? I 'm sure she is not a beggar ! "
39352	39361	39363	39363	Nora	84	" She did n't speak like a beggar ! "
39365	39379	39363	39363	Nora	84	" And her face did n't really look like a beggar 's face ! "
39380	39388	39390	39390	Janet	83	" Besides , she did n't beg , "
39392	39422	39390	39390	Janet	83	" I was so afraid she might be angry with you . You know , it makes people angry to be taken for beggars when they are not beggars . "
39423	39429	39431	39431	Donald	85	" She was n't angry , "
39441	39464	39431	39431	Donald	85	" She laughed a little , and she said I was a kind , kind little darling thing . And I was ! "
39467	39474	39431	39431	Donald	85	" It was my whole sixpence . "
39481	39491	39493	39493	Janet	83	" A beggar girl would never have said that , "
39495	39523	39493	39493	Janet	83	" She would have said , ' Thank yer kindly , little gentleman thank yer , sir ; ' and perhaps she would have bobbed a curtsy . "
39573	39584	39585	39585	Janet	83	" She is a kind of servant at the seminary , "
39588	39617	39585	39585	Janet	83	" I do n't believe she belongs to anybody . I believe she is an orphan . But she is not a beggar , however shabby she looks . "
39628	39645	39620	39620	she	18	" The - little - girl - who - is - not - a - beggar , "
40048	40050	40047	40047	her	18	" pretends "
40107	40114	40116	40116	Sara	18	" As to answering , though , "
40123	40301	40116	40116	Sara	18	" I do n't answer very often . I never answer when I can help it . When people are insulting you , there is nothing so good for them as not to say a word just to look at them and THINK . Miss Minchin turns pale with rage when I do it , Miss Amelia looks frightened , and so do the girls . When you will not fly into a passion people know you are stronger than they are , because you are strong enough to hold in your rage , and they are not , and they say stupid things they wish they had n't said afterward . There 's nothing so strong as rage , except what makes you hold it in that 's stronger . It 's a good thing not to answer your enemies . I scarcely ever do . Perhaps Emily is more like me than I am like myself . Perhaps she would rather not answer her friends , even . She keeps it all in her heart . "
40531	40537	40538	40538	she	1016	" I shall die presently , "
40547	40554	40556	40558	the poor child	1025	" I ca n't bear this , "
40562	40659	40556	40558	the poor child	1025	" I know I shall die . I 'm cold ; I 'm wet ; I 'm starving to death . I 've walked a thousand miles today , and they have done nothing but scold me from morning until night . And because I could not find that last thing the cook sent me for , they would not give me any supper . Some men laughed at me because my old shoes made me slip down in the mud . I 'm covered with mud now . And they laughed . Do you hear ? "
40705	40713	40714	40714	she	1026	" You are nothing but a DOLL ! "
40717	40754	40714	40714	she	1026	" Nothing but a doll doll doll ! You care for nothing . You are stuffed with sawdust . You never had a heart . Nothing could ever make you feel . You are a DOLL ! "
40910	40919	40920	40920	she	18	" You ca n't help being a doll , "
40927	40955	40920	40920	she	18	" any more than Lavinia and Jessie can help not having any sense . We are not all made alike . Perhaps you do your sawdust best . "
41031	41039	41040	41040	she	18	" If it looked a nice head , "
41043	41082	41040	41040	she	18	" I might begin by saying , ' Good morning , ' and all sorts of things might happen . But , of course , it 's not really likely that anyone but under servants would sleep there . "
41162	41167	41168	41168	she	18	" It 's taken ! "
41171	41193	41168	41168	she	18	" It really IS taken ! Oh , I do hope a nice head will look out of the attic window ! "
41242	41254	41255	41255	she	18	" Miss Minchin 's tables and chairs are just like her , "
41258	41332	41255	41255	she	18	" I remember thinking that the first minute I saw her , even though I was so little . I told papa afterward , and he laughed and said it was true . I am sure the Large Family have fat , comfortable armchairs and sofas , and I can see that their red - flowery wallpaper is exactly like them . It 's warm and cheerful and kind - looking and happy . "
41447	41453	41454	41454	she	18	" They are beautiful things , "
41457	41486	41454	41454	she	18	" they look as if they ought to belong to a nice person . All the things look rather grand . I suppose it is a rich family . "
41592	41603	41604	41604	Sara	18	" Someone in the family MUST have been in India , "
41607	41644	41604	41604	Sara	18	" They have got used to Indian things and like them . I AM glad . I shall feel as if they were friends , even if a head never looks out of the attic window . "
41800	41808	41809	41809	Sara	18	" If the new people have children , "
41812	41839	41809	41809	Sara	18	" the Large Family children will be sure to come and play with them , and they MIGHT come up into the attic just for fun . "
41862	41880	41881	41881	she	48	" It 's a ' Nindian gentleman that 's comin ' to live next door , miss , "
41884	42004	41881	41881	she	48	" I do n't know whether he 's a black gentleman or not , but he 's a Nindian one . He 's very rich , an ' he 's ill , an ' the gentleman of the Large Family is his lawyer . He 's had a lot of trouble , an ' it 's made him ill an ' low in his mind . He worships idols , miss . He 's an ' eathen an ' bows down to wood an ' stone . I seen a ' idol bein ' carried in for him to worship . Somebody had oughter send him a trac ' . You can get a trac ' for a penny . "
42010	42020	42021	42021	she	18	" I do n't believe he worships that idol , "
42053	42053	42047	42047	he	2236	"
42068	42073	42064	42066	the new neighbor	1068	" an ' eathen . "
42175	42179	42194	42194	she	18	" ' eathens . "
42180	42193	42194	42194	she	18	" I never lived next door to no ' eathens , miss , "
42197	42212	42194	42194	she	18	" I should like to see what sort o ' ways they 'd have . "
42400	42412	42413	42413	Lottie	31	" There is such a yellow gentleman next door , Sara , "
42421	42439	42413	42413	Lottie	31	" Do you think he is a Chinee ? The geography says the Chinee men are yellow . "
42440	42448	42449	42449	Sara	18	" No , he is not Chinese , "
42453	42482	42449	42449	Sara	18	" he is very ill . Go on with your exercise , Lottie . ' Non , monsieur . Je n'ai pas le canif de mon oncle . ' "
43177	43184	43186	43186	Sara	18	" It 's a Splendid one , "
43193	43220	43186	43186	Sara	18	" It makes me feel almost afraid as if something strange was just going to happen . The Splendid ones always make me feel like that . "
43331	43335	43336	43336	Sara	18	" a Lascar , "
43733	43741	43742	43742	she	18	" Will he let me catch him ? "
43947	43953	43954	43954	she	18	" Can you get across ? "
43957	43962	43963	43963	he	1143	" In a moment , "
43967	43971	43972	43972	she	18	" Then come , "
43975	43992	43972	43972	she	18	" he is flying from side to side of the room as if he was frightened . "
44719	44723	44724	44724	she	18	" Whatever comes , "
44727	44882	44724	44724	she	18	" can not alter one thing . If I am a princess in rags and tatters , I can be a princess inside . It would be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold , but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it . There was Marie Antoinette when she was in prison and her throne was gone and she had only a black gown on , and her hair was white , and they insulted her and called her Widow Capet . She was a great deal more like a queen then than when she was so gay and everything was so grand . I like her best then . Those howling mobs of people did not frighten her . She was stronger than they were , even when they cut her head off . "
45043	45105	45037	45037	Sara	18	" You do n't know that you are saying these things to a princess , and that if I chose I could wave my hand and order you to execution . I only spare you because I am a princess , and you are a poor , stupid , unkind , vulgar old thing , and do n't know any better . "
45166	45173	45174	45174	she	1178	" A princess must be polite , "
45221	45241	45243	45244	the cook	2053	" She 's got more airs and graces than if she come from Buckingham Palace , that young one , "
45251	45319	45243	45244	the cook	2053	" I lose my temper with her often enough , but I will say she never forgets her manners . ' If you please , cook ' ; ' Will you be so kind , cook ? ' ' I beg your pardon , cook ' ; ' May I trouble you , cook ? ' She drops 'em about the kitchen as if they was nothing . "
45542	45555	45556	45557	Miss Minchin	22	" What are you laughing at , you bold , impudent child ? "
45591	45596	45597	45597	she	18	" I was thinking , "
45600	45606	45608	45609	Miss Minchin	22	" Beg my pardon immediately , "
45619	45633	45634	45634	she	18	" I will beg your pardon for laughing , if it was rude , "
45638	45649	45634	45634	she	18	" but I wo n't beg your pardon for thinking . "
45650	45656	45658	45659	Miss Minchin	22	" What were you thinking ? "
45661	45672	45658	45659	Miss Minchin	22	" How dare you think ? What were you thinking ? "
45749	45754	45755	45755	she	18	" I was thinking , "
45761	45772	45755	45755	she	18	" that you did not know what you were doing . "
45773	45784	45785	45786	Miss Minchin	22	" That I did not know what I was doing ? "
45790	45793	45795	45795	Sara	18	" Yes , "
45797	45862	45795	45795	Sara	18	" and I was thinking what would happen if I were a princess and you boxed my ears what I should do to you . And I was thinking that if I were one , you would never dare to do it , whatever I said or did . And I was thinking how surprised and frightened you would be if you suddenly found out "
45913	45916	45917	45917	she	18	" What ? "
45920	45925	45917	45917	she	18	" Found out what ? "
45926	45934	45936	45936	Sara	18	" That I really was a princess , "
45938	45947	45936	45936	Sara	18	" and could do anything anything I liked . "
45970	45976	45978	45979	Miss Minchin	22	" Go to your room , "
45983	45999	45978	45979	Miss Minchin	22	" this instant ! Leave the schoolroom ! Attend to your lessons , young ladies ! "
46006	46016	46017	46017	she	18	" Excuse me for laughing if it was impolite , "
46043	46057	46058	46058	Jessie	33	" Did you see her ? Did you see how queer she looked ? "
46062	46083	46058	46058	Jessie	33	" I should n't be at all surprised if she did turn out to be something . Suppose she should ! "
46194	46203	46204	46204	she	18	" I am growing quite fond of him , "
46209	46278	46204	46204	she	18	" I should not like him to be disturbed . I have adopted him for a friend . You can do that with people you never speak to at all . You can just watch them , and think about them and be sorry for them , until they seem almost like relations . I 'm quite anxious sometimes when I see the doctor call twice a day . "
46279	46286	46288	46288	Ermengarde	40	" I have very few relations , "
46292	46367	46288	46288	Ermengarde	40	" and I 'm very glad of it . I do n't like those I have . My two aunts are always saying , ' Dear me , Ermengarde ! You are very fat . You should n't eat sweets , ' and my uncle is always asking me things like , ' When did Edward the Third ascend the throne ? ' and , ' Who died of a surfeit of lampreys ? ' "
46371	46385	46386	46386	she	18	" People you never speak to ca n't ask you questions like that , "
46389	46414	46386	46386	she	18	" and I 'm sure the Indian gentleman would n't even if he was quite intimate with you . I am fond of him . "
46573	46581	46583	46584	the cook	2053	" And mines with diamonds in 'em ! "
46586	46600	46583	46584	the cook	2053	" No savin 's of mine never goes into no mines particular diamond ones "
46608	46616	46583	46584	the cook	2053	" We all know somethin' of THEM . "
46617	46625	46626	46626	Sara	18	" He felt as my papa felt , "
46629	46644	46626	46626	Sara	18	" He was ill as my papa was ; but he did not die . "
46734	46745	46747	46747	her	18	" Perhaps you can FEEL if you ca n't hear , "
46750	46806	46807	46807	she	18	" Perhaps kind thoughts reach people somehow , even through windows and doors and walls . Perhaps you feel a little warm and comforted , and do n't know why , when I am standing here in the cold and hoping you will get well and happy again . I am so sorry for you , "
46816	46866	46807	46807	she	18	" I wish you had a ' Little Missus ' who could pet you as I used to pet papa when he had a headache . I should like to be your ' Little Missus ' myself , poor dear ! Good night good night . God bless you ! "
46961	46977	46978	46978	she	18	" He always seems as if he were thinking of something that hurts him NOW , "
46983	47019	46978	46978	she	18	" but he has got his money back and he will get over his brain fever in time , so he ought not to look like that . I wonder if there is something else . "
47185	47192	47194	47194	Janet	83	" He is a poor thing , "
47196	47214	47194	47194	Janet	83	" and he says we cheer him up . We try to cheer him up very quietly . "
47404	47407	47408	47408	he	96	" Carmichael , "
47425	47475	47408	47408	he	96	" I wonder how many of the attics in this square are like that one , and how many wretched little servant girls sleep on such beds , while I toss on my down pillows , loaded and harassed by wealth that is , most of it not mine . "
47476	47481	47482	47483	Mr. Carmichael	97	" My dear fellow , "
47487	47562	47482	47483	Mr. Carmichael	97	" the sooner you cease tormenting yourself the better it will be for you . If you possessed all the wealth of all the Indies , you could not set right all the discomforts in the world , and if you began to refurnish all the attics in this square , there would still remain all the attics in all the other squares and streets to put in order . And there you are ! "
47583	47588	47589	47589	he	96	" Do you suppose , "
47596	47635	47589	47589	he	96	" do you think it is possible that the other child the child I never cease thinking of , I believe could be could POSSIBLY be reduced to any such condition as the poor little soul next door ? "
47677	47697	47698	47698	he	96	" If the child at Madame Pascal 's school in Paris was the one you are in search of , "
47760	47760	47746	47747	Madame Pascal	38	"
47761	47776	47778	47779	Mr. Carrisford	96	" And the wretched woman actually did not know where they had taken her ! "
47787	47850	47746	47747	Madame Pascal	38	" She was a shrewd , worldly Frenchwoman , and was evidently only too glad to get the child so comfortably off her hands when the father 's death left her totally unprovided for . Women of her type do not trouble themselves about the futures of children who might prove burdens . The adopted parents apparently disappeared and left no trace . "
47851	47887	47746	47747	Madame Pascal	38	" But you say ' IF the child was the one I am in search of . You say ' if . ' We are not sure . There was a difference in the name . "
47888	47941	47942	47943	Mr. Carmichael	97	" Madame Pascal pronounced it as if it were Carew instead of Crewe but that might be merely a matter of pronunciation . The circumstances were curiously similar . An English officer in India had placed his motherless little girl at the school . He had died suddenly after losing his fortune . "
47958	47979	47942	47943	Mr. Carmichael	97	" Are you SURE the child was left at a school in Paris ? Are you sure it was Paris ? "
47980	47985	47987	47988	forth Carrisford	96	" My dear fellow , "
47994	48105	47987	47988	forth Carrisford	96	" I am SURE of nothing . I never saw either the child or her mother . Ralph Crewe and I loved each other as boys , but we had not met since our school days , until we met in India . I was absorbed in the magnificent promise of the mines . He became absorbed , too . The whole thing was so huge and glittering that we half lost our heads . When we met we scarcely spoke of anything else . I only knew that the child had been sent to school somewhere . I do not even remember , now , HOW I knew it . "
48157	48170	48133	48134	Mr. Carmichael	97	" But you had reason to think the school WAS in Paris ? "
48171	48174	48133	48134	Mr. Carmichael	97	" Yes , "
48179	48212	48133	48134	Mr. Carmichael	97	" because her mother was a Frenchwoman , and I had heard that she wished her child to be educated in Paris . It seemed only likely that she would be there . "
48213	48216	48217	48218	Mr. Carmichael	97	" Yes , "
48221	48228	48217	48218	Mr. Carmichael	97	" it seems more than probable . "
48245	48248	48249	48249	he	930	" Carmichael , "
48252	48328	48249	48249	he	930	" I MUST find her . If she is alive , she is somewhere . If she is friendless and penniless , it is through my fault . How is a man to get back his nerve with a thing like that on his mind ? This sudden change of luck at the mines has made realities of all our most fantastic dreams , and poor Crewe 's child may be begging in the street ! "
48329	48334	48336	48336	Carmichael	97	" No , no , "
48338	48364	48336	48336	Carmichael	97	" Try to be calm . Console yourself with the fact that when she is found you have a fortune to hand over to her . "
48365	48381	48382	48382	Carrisford	96	" Why was I not man enough to stand my ground when things looked black ? "
48388	48463	48382	48382	Carrisford	96	" I believe I should have stood my ground if I had not been responsible for other people 's money as well as my own . Poor Crewe had put into the scheme every penny that he owned . He trusted me he LOVED me . And he died thinking I had ruined him I Tom Carrisford , who played cricket at Eton with him . What a villain he must have thought me ! "
48464	48472	48382	48382	Carrisford	96	" Do n't reproach yourself so bitterly . "
48473	48522	48382	48382	Carrisford	96	" I do n't reproach myself because the speculation threatened to fail I reproach myself for losing my courage . I ran away like a swindler and a thief , because I could not face my best friend and tell him I had ruined him and his child . "
48540	48557	48558	48558	he	1255	" You ran away because your brain had given way under the strain of mental torture , "
48561	48609	48558	48558	he	1255	" You were half delirious already . If you had not been you would have stayed and fought it out . You were in a hospital , strapped down in bed , raving with brain fever , two days after you left the place . Remember that . "
48618	48624	48625	48625	he	96	" Good God ! Yes , "
48628	48667	48625	48625	he	96	" I was driven mad with dread and horror . I had not slept for weeks . The night I staggered out of my house all the air seemed full of hideous things mocking and mouthing at me . "
48668	48676	48678	48679	Mr. Carmichael	97	" That is explanation enough in itself , "
48681	48695	48678	48679	Mr. Carmichael	97	" How could a man on the verge of brain fever judge sanely ! "
48702	48750	48698	48698	his	96	" And when I returned to consciousness poor Crewe was dead and buried . And I seemed to remember nothing . I did not remember the child for months and months . Even when I began to recall her existence everything seemed in a sort of haze . "
48760	48794	48751	48751	He	96	" It sometimes seems so now when I try to remember . Surely I must sometime have heard Crewe speak of the school she was sent to . Do n't you think so ? "
48795	48816	48751	48751	He	96	" He might not have spoken of it definitely . You never seem even to have heard her real name . "
48817	48878	48751	48751	He	96	" He used to call her by an odd pet name he had invented . He called her his ' Little Missus . ' But the wretched mines drove everything else out of our heads . We talked of nothing else . If he spoke of the school , I forgot I forgot . And now I shall never remember . "
48879	48884	48886	48886	Carmichael	97	" Come , come , "
48888	48936	48886	48886	Carmichael	97	" We shall find her yet . We will continue to search for Madame Pascal 's good - natured Russians . She seemed to have a vague idea that they lived in Moscow . We will take that as a clue . I will go to Moscow . "
48937	48951	48953	48953	Carrisford	96	" If I were able to travel , I would go with you , "
48955	49033	48953	48953	Carrisford	96	" but I can only sit here wrapped in furs and stare at the fire . And when I look into it I seem to see Crewe 's gay young face gazing back at me . He looks as if he were asking me a question . Sometimes I dream of him at night , and he always stands before me and asks the same question in words . Can you guess what he says , Carmichael ? "
49044	49048	49049	49049	he	97	" Not exactly , "
49052	49070	49071	49071	He	97	" He always says , ' Tom , old man Tom where is the Little Missus ? ' "
49082	49093	49094	49094	he	97	" I must be able to answer him I must ! "
49097	49107	49094	49094	he	97	" Help me to find her . Help me . "
49134	49147	49148	49148	she	18	" It has been hard to be a princess today , Melchisedec , "
49151	49254	49148	49148	she	18	" It has been harder than usual . It gets harder as the weather grows colder and the streets get more sloppy . When Lavinia laughed at my muddy skirt as I passed her in the hall , I thought of something to say all in a flash and I only just stopped myself in time . You ca n't sneer back at people like that if you are a princess . But you have to bite your tongue to hold yourself in . I bit mine . It was a cold afternoon , Melchisedec . And it 's a cold night . "
49276	49281	49282	49282	she	18	" Oh , papa , "
49285	49301	49282	49282	she	18	" what a long time it seems since I was your ' Little Missus ' ! "
49571	49579	49580	49580	she	48	" ' Twarn't for you , miss , "
49594	49689	49580	49580	she	48	" ' twarn't for you , an ' the Bastille , an ' bein ' the prisoner in the next cell , I should die . That there does seem real now , does n't it ? The missus is more like the head jailer every day she lives . I can jest see them big keys you say she carries . The cook she 's like one of the under - jailers . Tell me some more , please , miss tell me about the subt'ranean passage we 've dug under the walls . "
49690	49698	49700	49700	Sara	18	" I 'll tell you something warmer , "
49702	49813	49700	49700	Sara	18	" Get your coverlet and wrap it round you , and I 'll get mine , and we will huddle close together on the bed , and I 'll tell you about the tropical forest where the Indian gentleman 's monkey used to live . When I see him sitting on the table near the window and looking out into the street with that mournful expression , I always feel sure he is thinking about the tropical forest where he used to swing by his tail from coconut trees . I wonder who caught him , and if he left a family behind who had depended on him for coconuts . "
49814	49821	49823	49823	Becky	48	" That is warmer , miss , "
49827	49849	49823	49823	Becky	48	" but , someways , even the Bastille is sort of heatin ' when you gets to tellin ' about it . "
49850	49862	49864	49864	Sara	18	" That is because it makes you think of something else , "
49886	49916	49864	49864	Sara	18	" I 've noticed this . What you have to do with your mind , when your body is miserable , is to make it think of something else . "
49917	49925	49927	49927	Becky	48	" Can you do it , miss ? "
49942	49952	49953	49953	she	18	" Sometimes I can and sometimes I ca n't , "
49957	50065	49953	49953	she	18	" But when I CAN I 'm all right . And what I believe is that we always could if we practiced enough . I 've been practicing a good deal lately , and it 's beginning to be easier than it used to be . When things are horrible just horrible I think as hard as ever I can of being a princess . I say to myself , ' I am a princess , and I am a fairy one , and because I am a fairy nothing can hurt me or make me uncomfortable . ' You do n't know how it makes you forget "
50338	50340	50331	50331	Her	1272	" pretend "
50344	50435	50331	50331	Her	1272	" with all the strength that was left in her . But really this time it was harder than she had ever found it , and once or twice she thought it almost made her more cold and hungry instead of less so . But she persevered obstinately , and as the muddy water squelched through her broken shoes and the wind seemed trying to drag her thin jacket from her , she talked to herself as she walked , though she did not speak aloud or even move her lips .
50436	50444	50445	50445	she	1272	" Suppose I had dry clothes on , "
50448	50519	50331	50331	Her	1272	" Suppose I had good shoes and a long , thick coat and merino stockings and a whole umbrella . And suppose suppose just when I was near a baker 's where they sold hot buns , I should find sixpence which belonged to nobody . SUPPOSE if I did , I should go into the shop and buy six of the hottest buns and eat them all without stopping . "
50679	50682	50683	50683	she	18	" Oh , "
50686	50695	50683	50683	she	18	" it is true ! It is true ! "
50848	50864	50865	50865	she	18	" But I 'll go and ask the baker woman if she has lost anything , "
50995	50998	50999	50999	she	18	" This , "
51009	51023	50999	50999	she	18	" is one of the populace and she is hungrier than I am . "
51027	51032	51040	51040	herself	261	" one of the populace "
51081	51085	51100	51100	she	18	" move on . "
51105	51110	51111	51111	she	18	" Are you hungry ? "
51125	51131	51132	51132	she	261	" Ai n't I jist ? "
51139	51145	51132	51132	she	261	" Jist ai n't I ? "
51146	51154	51156	51156	Sara	18	" Have n't you had any dinner ? "
51158	51162	51132	51132	she	261	" No dinner , "
51171	51183	51132	51132	she	261	" Nor yet no bre'fast nor yet no supper . No nothin' .
51184	51188	51190	51190	Sara	18	" Since when ? "
51192	51208	51132	51132	she	261	" Dunno . Never got nothin' today nowhere . I 've axed an ' axed . "
51247	51254	51255	51255	she	18	" If I 'm a princess , "
51259	51329	51255	51255	she	18	" if I 'm a princess when they were poor and driven from their thrones they always shared with the populace if they met one poorer and hungrier than themselves . They always shared . Buns are a penny each . If it had been sixpence I could have eaten six . It wo n't be enough for either of us . But it will be better than nothing . "
51330	51335	51336	51336	she	18	" Wait a minute , "
51371	51376	51378	51378	Sara	18	" If you please , "
51380	51389	51391	51391	she	18	" have you lost fourpence a silver fourpence ? "
51424	51430	51431	51431	she	1295	" Bless us , no , "
51434	51440	51431	51431	she	1295	" Did you find it ? "
51441	51444	51446	51446	Sara	18	" Yes , "
51448	51453	51446	51446	Sara	18	" In the gutter . "
51454	51460	51462	51463	the woman	1295	" Keep it , then , "
51465	51488	51462	51463	the woman	1295	" It may have been there for a week , and goodness knows who lost it . YOU could never find out . "
51489	51494	51496	51496	Sara	18	" I know that , "
51498	51507	51496	51496	Sara	18	" but I thought I would ask you . "
51508	51513	51515	51516	the woman	1295	" Not many would , "
51530	51538	51539	51539	she	1295	" Do you want to buy something ? "
51551	51559	51561	51561	Sara	18	" Four buns , if you please , "
51563	51570	51561	51561	Sara	18	" Those at a penny each . "
51593	51602	51603	51603	she	18	" I said four , if you please , "
51606	51612	51603	51603	she	18	" I have only fourpence . "
51613	51622	51624	51625	the woman	1295	" I 'll throw in two for makeweight , "
51633	51648	51624	51625	the woman	1295	" I dare say you can eat them sometime . Are n't you hungry ? "
51657	51660	51661	51661	she	18	" Yes , "
51664	51682	51683	51683	she	1295	" I am very hungry , and I am much obliged to you for your kindness ; and "
51688	51701	51683	51683	she	1295	" there is a child outside who is hungrier than I am . "
51840	51843	51844	51844	she	18	" See , "
51855	51873	51844	51844	she	18	" this is nice and hot . Eat it , and you will not feel so hungry . "
51914	51923	51926	51926	her	1304	" Oh , my ! Oh , my ! "
51934	51938	51926	51926	her	1304	" OH my ! "
51961	51969	51970	51970	she	18	" She is hungrier than I am , "
51975	51980	51970	51970	she	18	" She 's starving . "
51993	51999	52000	52000	she	18	" I 'm not starving , "
52055	52060	52062	52062	Sara	18	" Good - bye , "
52159	52165	52166	52166	she	1310	" Well , I never ! "
52169	52217	52166	52166	she	1310	" If that young un has n't given her buns to a beggar child ! It was n't because she did n't want them , either . Well , well , she looked hungry enough . I 'd give something to know what she did it for . "
52251	52258	52259	52259	she	1310	" Who gave you those buns ? "
52274	52280	52282	52283	the woman	1295	" What did she say ? "
52285	52294	52266	52266	her	261	" Axed me if I was ' ungry , "
52300	52306	52335	52336	The child	261	" What did you say ? "
52307	52313	52335	52336	The child	261	" Said I was jist . "
52314	52334	52335	52336	The child	261	" And then she came in and got the buns , and gave them to you , did she ? "
52339	52343	52335	52336	The child	261	" How many ? "
52344	52347	52335	52336	The child	261	" Five . "
52354	52361	52362	52362	she	1295	" Left just one for herself , "
52369	52385	52362	52362	she	1295	" And she could have eaten the whole six I saw it in her eyes . "
52414	52424	52425	52425	she	1295	" I wish she had n't gone so quick , "
52428	52441	52425	52425	she	1295	" I 'm blest if she should n't have had a dozen . "
52449	52455	52456	52456	she	1295	" Are you hungry yet ? "
52459	52465	52443	52443	she	1295	" I 'm allus hungry , "
52470	52482	52443	52443	she	1295	" but ' t ai n't as bad as it was . "
52483	52488	52494	52494	she	1295	" Come in here , "
52541	52546	52548	52549	the woman	1295	" Get yourself warm , "
52561	52605	52548	52549	the woman	1295	" And look here ; when you are hard up for a bit of bread , you can come in here and ask for it . I 'm blest if I wo n't give it to you for that young one 's sake . "
52650	52658	52659	52659	she	18	" Suppose it was a magic bun , "
52662	52686	52659	52659	she	18	" and a bite was as much as a whole dinner . I should be overeating myself if I went on like this . "
52904	52914	52915	52915	she	18	" I wonder if he will stay away long , "
52918	52950	52915	52915	she	18	" The portmanteau is rather big . Oh , dear , how they will miss him ! I shall miss him myself even though he does n't know I am alive . "
52988	52996	52998	53001	the little girl Janet	1342	" Will Moscow be covered with snow ? "
53003	53010	52998	53001	the little girl Janet	1342	" Will there be ice everywhere ? "
53011	53019	53021	53021	another	1343	" Shall you drive in a drosky ? "
53023	53030	53021	53021	another	1343	" Shall you see the Czar ? "
53031	53042	53043	53043	he	1339	" I will write and tell you all about it , "
53048	53095	53043	53043	he	1339	" And I will send you pictures of muzhiks and things . Run into the house . It is a hideous damp night . I would rather stay with you than go to Moscow . Good night ! Good night , duckies ! God bless you ! "
53108	53121	53123	53124	Guy Clarence	80	" If you find the little girl , give her our love , "
53144	53149	53151	53151	Janet	83	" Did you see , "
53162	53256	53151	53151	Janet	83	" the little - girl - who - is - not - a - beggar was passing ? She looked all cold and wet , and I saw her turn her head over her shoulder and look at us . Mamma says her clothes always look as if they had been given her by someone who was quite rich someone who only let her have them because they were too shabby to wear . The people at the school always send her out on errands on the horridest days and nights there are . "
53273	53282	53283	53283	she	18	" I wonder who the little girl is , "
53285	53296	53283	53283	she	18	" the little girl he is going to look for . "
53864	53870	53871	53871	he	1370	" Was that a rat ? "
53879	53887	53889	53890	Ram Dass	89	" Yes ; a rat , Sahib , "
53895	53903	53889	53890	Ram Dass	89	" There are many in the walls . "
53904	53907	53909	53911	the young man	1371	" Ugh ! "
53913	53926	53909	53911	the young man	1371	" It is a wonder the child is not terrified of them . "
53962	53975	53976	53976	he	89	" The child is the little friend of all things , Sahib , "
53979	54154	53976	53976	he	89	" She is not as other children . I see her when she does not see me . I slip across the slates and look at her many nights to see that she is safe . I watch her from my window when she does not know I am near . She stands on the table there and looks out at the sky as if it spoke to her . The sparrows come at her call . The rat she has fed and tamed in her loneliness . The poor slave of the house comes to her for comfort . There is a little child who comes to her in secret ; there is one older who worships her and would listen to her forever if she might . This I have seen when I have crept across the roof . By the mistress of the house who is an evil woman she is treated like a pariah ; but she has the bearing of a child who is of the blood of kings ! "
54155	54166	54167	54168	the secretary	1373	" You seem to know a great deal about her , "
54171	54180	54182	54183	Ram Dass	89	" All her life each day I know , "
54185	54283	54182	54183	Ram Dass	89	" Her going out I know , and her coming in ; her sadness and her poor joys ; her coldness and her hunger . I know when she is alone until midnight , learning from her books ; I know when her secret friends steal to her and she is happier as children can be , even in the midst of poverty because they come and she may laugh and talk with them in whispers . If she were ill I should know , and I would come and serve her if it might be done . "
54284	54327	54389	54390	The secretary	1373	" You are sure no one comes near this place but herself , and that she will not return and surprise us . She would be frightened if she found us here , and the Sahib Carrisford 's plan would be spoiled . "
54341	54350	54351	54351	he	89	" None mount here but herself , Sahib , "
54354	54388	54351	54351	he	89	" She has gone out with her basket and may be gone for hours . If I stand here I can hear any step before it reaches the last flight of the stairs . "
54402	54408	54409	54409	he	1373	" Keep your ears open , "
54458	54465	54466	54466	he	1373	" As hard as a stone , "
54469	54501	54502	54502	He	1373	" That will have to be altered some day when she is out . A special journey can be made to bring it across . It can not be done tonight . "
54513	54527	54528	54528	he	1373	" Coverlet dingy and worn , blanket thin , sheets patched and ragged , "
54531	54564	54528	54528	he	1373	" What a bed for a child to sleep in and in a house which calls itself respectable ! There has not been a fire in that grate for many a day , "
54571	54579	54581	54582	Ram Dass	89	" Never since I have seen it , "
54584	54603	54581	54582	Ram Dass	89	" The mistress of the house is not one who remembers that another than herself may be cold . "
54632	54643	54644	54644	he	1373	" It is a strange way of doing the thing , "
54647	54652	54644	54644	he	1373	" Who planned it ? "
54661	54674	54675	54675	he	1373	" It is true that the first thought was mine , Sahib , "
54678	54843	54675	54675	he	1373	" though it was naught but a fancy . I am fond of this child ; we are both lonely . It is her way to relate her visions to her secret friends . Being sad one night , I lay close to the open skylight and listened . The vision she related told what this miserable room might be if it had comforts in it . She seemed to see it as she talked , and she grew cheered and warmed as she spoke . Then she came to this fancy ; and the next day , the Sahib being ill and wretched , I told him of the thing to amuse him . It seemed then but a dream , but it pleased the Sahib . To hear of the child 's doings gave him entertainment . He became interested in her and asked questions . At last he began to please himself with the thought of making her visions real things . "
54844	54860	54862	54863	the secretary	1373	" You think that it can be done while she sleeps ? Suppose she awakened , "
54892	54904	54905	54906	Ram Dass	89	" I can move as if my feet were of velvet , "
54909	54976	54905	54906	Ram Dass	89	" and children sleep soundly even the unhappy ones . I could have entered this room in the night many times , and without causing her to turn upon her pillow . If the other bearer passes to me the things through the window , I can do all and she will not stir . When she awakens she will think a magician has been here . "
54997	55009	55010	55010	he	1373	" It will be like a story from the Arabian Nights , "
55013	55030	55010	55010	he	1373	" Only an Oriental could have planned it . It does not belong to London fogs . "
55122	55130	55131	55131	he	1373	" You can hang things on them , "
55139	55147	55148	55148	he	1373	" Yesterday , when she was out , "
55151	55191	55148	55148	he	1373	" I entered , bringing with me small , sharp nails which can be pressed into the wall without blows from a hammer . I placed many in the plaster where I may need them . They are ready . "
55213	55227	55228	55228	he	1373	" I think I have made notes enough ; we can go now , "
55231	55254	55228	55228	he	1373	" The Sahib Carrisford has a warm heart . It is a thousand pities that he has not found the lost child . "
55255	55269	55271	55272	Ram Dass	89	" If he should find her his strength would be restored to him , "
55274	55284	55271	55272	Ram Dass	89	" His God may lead her to him yet . "
55392	55408	55374	55374	she	18	" It is a long time since I saw a nice place from the inside , "
55455	55459	55461	55461	Sara	18	" Poor man ! "
55463	55471	55461	55461	Sara	18	" I wonder what you are supposing . "
55480	55485	55476	55476	he	930	" at that very moment .
55486	55489	55490	55490	he	930	" Suppose , "
55543	55543	55539	55539	I	0	"
55564	55572	55573	55573	she	22	" Where have you wasted your time ? "
55576	55584	55573	55573	she	22	" You have been out for hours . "
55585	55593	55594	55594	Sara	18	" It was so wet and muddy , "
55597	55614	55594	55594	Sara	18	" it was hard to walk , because my shoes were so bad and slipped about . "
55615	55620	55622	55623	Miss Minchin	22	" Make no excuses , "
55625	55631	55622	55623	Miss Minchin	22	" and tell no falsehoods . "
55679	55688	55689	55689	she	22	" Why did n't you stay all night ? "
55700	55706	55707	55707	she	18	" Here are the things , "
55727	55735	55736	55736	Sara	18	" May I have something to eat ? "
55741	55749	55710	55711	The cook	2053	" Tea 's over and done with , "
55754	55766	55710	55711	The cook	2053	" Did you expect me to keep it hot for you ? "
55774	55780	55781	55781	she	18	" I had no dinner , "
55804	55813	55815	55816	the cook	2053	" There 's some bread in the pantry , "
55818	55831	55815	55816	the cook	2053	" That 's all you 'll get at this time of day . "
56138	56143	56144	56144	she	40	" Oh , Sara , "
56148	56208	56144	56144	she	40	" I am glad you have come . Melchy WOULD sniff about so . I tried to coax him to go back , but he would n't for such a long time . I like him , you know ; but it does frighten me when he sniffs right at me . Do you think he ever WOULD jump ? "
56209	56212	56214	56214	Sara	18	" No , "
56227	56235	56236	56236	she	40	" You DO look tired , Sara , "
56239	56245	56236	56236	she	40	" you are quite pale . "
56246	56251	56253	56253	Sara	18	" I AM tired , "
56262	56281	56253	56253	Sara	18	" Oh , there 's Melchisedec , poor thing . He 's come to ask for his supper . "
56334	56340	56341	56341	she	18	" I 'm very sorry , "
56344	56383	56341	56341	she	18	" I have n't one crumb left . Go home , Melchisedec , and tell your wife there was nothing in my pocket . I 'm afraid I forgot because the cook and Miss Minchin were so cross . "
56402	56414	56415	56415	Sara	18	" I did not expect to see you tonight , Ermie , "
56426	56441	56442	56442	she	40	" Miss Amelia has gone out to spend the night with her old aunt , "
56445	56473	56442	56442	she	40	" No one else ever comes and looks into the bedrooms after we are in bed . I could stay here until morning if I wanted to . "
56511	56522	56523	56523	she	40	" Papa has sent me some more books , Sara , "
56526	56531	56523	56523	she	40	" There they are . "
56568	56571	56572	56572	she	18	" Ah , "
56576	56593	56572	56572	she	18	" how beautiful ! Carlyle 's French Revolution . I have SO wanted to read that ! "
56594	56599	56601	56601	Ermengarde	40	" I have n't , "
56603	56637	56601	56601	Ermengarde	40	" And papa will be so cross if I do n't . He 'll expect me to know all about it when I go home for the holidays . What SHALL I do ? "
56656	56660	56661	56661	she	40	" Look here , "
56664	56700	56661	56661	she	40	" if you 'll lend me these books , I 'll read them and tell you everything that 's in them afterward and I 'll tell it so that you will remember it , too . "
56701	56706	56708	56708	Ermengarde	40	" Oh , goodness ! "
56710	56717	56708	56708	Ermengarde	40	" Do you think you can ? "
56718	56724	56725	56725	Sara	18	" I know I can , "
56728	56739	56725	56725	Sara	18	" The little ones always remember what I tell them . "
56740	56743	56745	56745	Ermengarde	40	" Sara , "
56754	56774	56745	56745	Ermengarde	40	" if you 'll do that , and make me remember , I 'll I 'll give you anything . "
56775	56786	56788	56788	Sara	18	" I do n't want you to give me anything , "
56790	56799	56788	56788	Sara	18	" I want your books I want them ! "
56811	56817	56819	56819	Ermengarde	40	" Take them , then , "
56821	56850	56819	56819	Ermengarde	40	" I wish I wanted them but I do n't . I 'm not clever , and my father is , and he thinks I ought to be . "
56860	56870	56871	56871	she	18	" What are you going to tell your father ? "
56882	56890	56892	56892	Ermengarde	40	" Oh , he need n't know , "
56894	56903	56892	56892	Ermengarde	40	" He 'll think I 've read them . "
56915	56923	56924	56924	she	18	" That 's almost like telling lies , "
56927	56945	56924	56924	she	18	" And lies well , you see , they are not only wicked they 're VULGAR . Sometimes "
56947	56996	56892	56892	Ermengarde	40	" I 've thought perhaps I might do something wicked I might suddenly fly into a rage and kill Miss Minchin , you know , when she was ill - treating me but I COULDN'T be vulgar . Why ca n't you tell your father I read them ? "
56997	57005	57007	57007	Ermengarde	40	" He wants me to read them , "
57019	57030	57032	57032	Sara	18	" He wants you to know what is in them , "
57034	57061	57032	57032	Sara	18	" And if I can tell it to you in an easy way and make you remember it , I should think he would like that . "
57062	57075	57077	57078	rueful Ermengarde	40	" He 'll like it if I learn anything in ANY way , "
57080	57089	57077	57078	rueful Ermengarde	40	" You would if you were my father . "
57090	57097	57099	57099	Sara	18	" It 's not your fault that "
57117	57128	57110	57110	She	18	" It 's not your fault that you are stupid . "
57129	57133	57134	57134	Ermengarde	40	" That what ? "
57137	57146	57148	57148	Sara	18	" That you ca n't learn things quickly , "
57150	57172	57148	57148	Sara	18	" If you ca n't , you ca n't . If I can why , I can ; that 's all . "
57232	57235	57236	57236	she	18	" Perhaps , "
57239	57307	57236	57236	she	18	" to be able to learn things quickly is n't everything . To be kind is worth a great deal to other people . If Miss Minchin knew everything on earth and was like what she is now , she 'd still be a detestable thing , and everybody would hate her . Lots of clever people have done harm and have been wicked . Look at Robespierre "
57323	57329	57330	57330	she	18	" Do n't you remember ? "
57333	57349	57330	57330	she	18	" I told you about him not long ago . I believe you 've forgotten . "
57350	57361	57363	57363	Ermengarde	40	" Well , I do n't remember ALL of it , "
57365	57373	57375	57375	Sara	18	" Well , you wait a minute , "
57377	57398	57375	57375	Sara	18	" and I 'll take off my wet things and wrap myself in the coverlet and tell you over again . "
57452	57457	57458	57458	she	18	" Now , listen , "
57528	57543	57544	57544	Sara	18	" You know they put her head on a pike and danced round it , "
57547	57586	57544	57544	Sara	18	" And she had beautiful floating blonde hair ; and when I think of her , I never see her head on her body , but always on a pike , with those furious people dancing and howling . "
57618	57627	57629	57629	Sara	18	" Now let 's tell each other things , "
57631	57642	57629	57629	Sara	18	" How are you getting on with your French lessons ? "
57643	57678	57591	57593	Mr. St. John	41	" Ever so much better since the last time I came up here and you explained the conjugations . Miss Minchin could not understand why I did my exercises so well that first morning . "
57688	57702	57703	57703	she	18	" She does n't understand why Lottie is doing her sums so well , "
57706	57723	57724	57724	She	18	" but it is because she creeps up here , too , and I help her . "
57730	57744	57745	57745	she	18	" The attic would be rather nice if it was n't so dreadful , "
57751	57761	57745	57745	she	18	" It 's a good place to pretend in . "
57822	57824	57801	57801	she	40	" pretended "
57956	57973	57974	57974	she	18	" I suppose soldiers feel like this when they are on a long and weary march , "
57988	57994	57980	57980	She	18	" long and weary march . "
58018	58026	58027	58027	she	18	" If I lived in a castle , "
58030	58145	58027	58027	she	18	" and Ermengarde was the lady of another castle , and came to see me , with knights and squires and vassals riding with her , and pennons flying , when I heard the clarions sounding outside the drawbridge I should go down to receive her , and I should spread feasts in the banquet hall and call in minstrels to sing and play and relate romances . When she comes into the attic I ca n't spread feasts , but I can tell stories , and not let her know disagreeable things . I dare say poor chatelaines had to do that in time of famine , when their lands had been pillaged . "
58237	58249	58250	58250	Ermengarde	40	" I wish I was as thin as you , Sara , "
58254	58285	58250	58250	Ermengarde	40	" I believe you are thinner than you used to be . Your eyes look so big , and look at the sharp little bones sticking out of your elbow ! "
58298	58306	58307	58307	she	18	" I always was a thin child , "
58311	58320	58307	58307	she	18	" and I always had big green eyes . "
58321	58328	58330	58330	Ermengarde	40	" I love your queer eyes , "
58339	58368	58330	58330	Ermengarde	40	" They always look as if they saw such a long way . I love them and I love them to be green though they look black generally . "
58369	58376	58378	58378	Sara	18	" They are cat 's eyes , "
58380	58405	58378	58378	Sara	18	" but I ca n't see in the dark with them because I have tried , and I could n't I wish I could . "
58491	58499	58500	58500	she	18	" That did n't sound like Melchisedec , "
58503	58510	58500	58500	she	18	" It was n't scratchy enough . "
58511	58514	58516	58516	Ermengarde	40	" What ? "
58522	58531	58533	58533	Sara	18	" Did n't you think you heard something ? "
58535	58540	58541	58541	Ermengarde	40	" N - no , "
58544	58548	58541	58541	Ermengarde	40	" Did you ? "
58553	58558	58541	58541	Ermengarde	40	" No - no , "
58559	58565	58567	58567	Sara	18	" Perhaps I did n't , "
58569	58590	58567	58567	Sara	18	" but I thought I did . It sounded as if something was on the slates something that dragged softly . "
58591	58597	58599	58599	Ermengarde	40	" What could it be ? "
58601	58607	58599	58599	Ermengarde	40	" Could it be robbers ? "
58608	58611	58612	58612	Sara	18	" No , "
58616	58622	58612	58612	Sara	18	" There is nothing to steal "
58676	58682	58683	58683	she	18	" She is scolding Becky , "
58693	58700	58683	58683	she	18	" She is making her cry . "
58701	58708	58709	58709	Ermengarde	40	" Will she come in here ? "
58717	58732	58752	58752	she	18	" No . She will think I am in bed . Do n't stir . "
58788	58795	58798	58798	her	22	" You impudent , dishonest child ! "
58801	58811	58798	58798	her	22	" Cook tells me she has missed things repeatedly . "
58812	58820	58822	58822	Becky	48	" ' T warn't me , mum , "
58825	58839	58822	58822	Becky	48	" I was ' ungry enough , but ' t warn't me never ! "
58840	58849	58851	58852	Miss Minchin	22	" You deserve to be sent to prison , "
58856	58868	58851	58852	Miss Minchin	22	" Picking and stealing ! Half a meat pie , indeed ! "
58869	58875	58877	58877	Becky	48	" ' T warn't me , "
58879	58897	58877	58877	Becky	48	" I could ' ave eat a whole un but I never laid a finger on it . "
58933	58939	58940	58940	she	22	" Do n't tell falsehoods , "
58943	58951	58940	58940	she	22	" Go to your room this instant . "
58993	59003	59006	59006	her	48	" I could ' ave e't two of 'em , "
59012	59030	59006	59006	her	48	" An ' I never took a bite . ' Twas cook give it to her policeman . "
59082	59089	59090	59090	she	48	" The wicked , cruel thing ! "
59094	59128	59090	59090	she	48	" The cook takes things herself and then says Becky steals them . She DOESN'T ! She DOESN'T ! She 's so hungry sometimes that she eats crusts out of the ash barrel ! "
59253	59256	59257	59257	she	48	" Sara , "
59269	59290	59257	59257	she	48	" are are you never told me I do n't want to be rude , but are YOU ever hungry ? "
59313	59316	59317	59317	she	18	" Yes , "
59325	59360	59317	59317	she	18	" Yes , I am . I 'm so hungry now that I could almost eat you . And it makes it worse to hear poor Becky . She 's hungrier than I am . "
59364	59369	59370	59370	she	40	" Oh , oh ! "
59374	59380	59370	59370	she	40	" And I never knew ! "
59381	59390	59391	59391	Sara	18	" I did n't want you to know , "
59394	59415	59391	59391	Sara	18	" It would have made me feel like a street beggar . I know I look like a street beggar . "
59416	59426	59427	59427	Ermengarde	40	" No , you do n't you do n't ! "
59431	59457	59427	59427	Ermengarde	40	" Your clothes are a little queer but you could n't look like a street beggar . You have n't a street - beggar face . "
59458	59470	59472	59472	Sara	18	" A little boy once gave me a sixpence for charity , "
59484	59489	59491	59491	she	18	" Here it is . "
59501	59522	59491	59491	she	18	" He would n't have given me his Christmas sixpence if I had n't looked as if I needed it . "
59554	59559	59561	59561	Ermengarde	40	" Who was he ? "
59579	59591	59593	59593	Sara	18	" He was a darling little thing going to a party , "
59595	59643	59593	59593	Sara	18	" He was one of the Large Family , the little one with the round legs the one I call Guy Clarence . I suppose his nursery was crammed with Christmas presents and hampers full of cakes and things , and he could see I had nothing . "
59668	59673	59674	59674	she	40	" Oh , Sara ! "
59677	59691	59674	59674	she	40	" What a silly thing I am not to have thought of it ! "
59692	59696	59593	59593	Sara	18	" Of what ? "
59697	59701	59703	59703	Ermengarde	40	" Something splendid ! "
59710	59752	59703	59703	Ermengarde	40	" This very afternoon my nicest aunt sent me a box . It is full of good things . I never touched it , I had so much pudding at dinner , and I was so bothered about papa 's books . "
59762	59814	59753	59753	Her	40	" It 's got cake in it , and little meat pies , and jam tarts and buns , and oranges and red - currant wine , and figs and chocolate . I 'll creep back to my room and get it this minute , and we 'll eat it now . "
59841	59848	59849	59849	she	18	" Do you think you COULD ? "
59852	59858	59860	59860	Ermengarde	40	" I know I could , "
59889	59911	59883	59883	she	40	" The lights are out . Everybody 's in bed . I can creep and creep and no one will hear . "
59933	59936	59937	59937	she	18	" Ermie ! "
59940	59967	59937	59937	she	18	" Let us PRETEND ! Let us pretend it 's a party ! And oh , wo n't you invite the prisoner in the next cell ? "
59968	59987	60005	60005	She	18	" Yes ! Yes ! Let us knock on the wall now . The jailer wo n't hear . "
60010	60038	60005	60005	She	18	" That means , ' Come to me through the secret passage under the wall , ' she explained . ' I have something to communicate . ' "
60045	60050	60051	60051	she	18	" She is coming , "
60095	60105	60107	60107	Ermengarde	40	" Do n't mind me a bit , Becky ! "
60109	60119	60121	60121	Sara	18	" Miss Ermengarde has asked you to come in , "
60123	60140	60121	60121	Sara	18	" because she is going to bring a box of good things up here to us . "
60156	60162	60163	60163	she	48	" To eat , miss ? "
60166	60174	60163	60163	she	48	" Things that 's good to eat ? "
60175	60178	60180	60180	Sara	18	" Yes , "
60182	60192	60180	60180	Sara	18	" and we are going to pretend a party . "
60193	60206	60209	60209	Ermengarde	40	" And you shall have as much as you WANT to eat , "
60211	60218	60209	60209	Ermengarde	40	" I 'll go this minute ! "
60269	60278	60279	60279	she	48	" Oh , miss ! oh , miss ! "
60282	60306	60279	60279	she	48	" I know it was you that asked her to let me come . It it makes me cry to think of it . "
60395	60402	60403	60403	she	40	" Somehow , something always happens , "
60406	60441	60403	60403	she	40	" just before things get to the very worst . It is as if the Magic did it . If I could only just remember that always . The worst thing never QUITE comes . "
60450	60460	60461	60461	she	40	" No , no ! You must n't cry ! "
60464	60474	60442	60442	She	40	" We must make haste and set the table . "
60475	60482	60484	60484	Becky	48	" Set the table , miss ? "
60491	60499	60484	60484	Becky	48	" What 'll we set it with ? "
60508	60517	60518	60518	she	18	" There does n't seem to be much , "
60546	60552	60553	60553	she	18	" Here 's the shawl , "
60556	60574	60553	60553	she	18	" I know she wo n't mind it . It will make such a nice red tablecloth . "
60608	60620	60622	60622	Sara	18	" How nice a red rug would look on the floor ! "
60624	60632	60622	60622	Sara	18	" We must pretend there is one ! "
60653	60661	60662	60662	she	40	" How soft and thick it is ! "
60695	60700	60702	60702	Becky	48	" Yes , miss , "
60716	60722	60724	60724	Sara	18	" What next , now ? "
60738	60749	60727	60727	she	18	" Something will come if I think and wait a little "
60757	60764	60727	60727	she	18	" The Magic will tell me . "
60773	60777	60779	60779	she	18	" the outside , "
60826	60829	60830	60830	she	48	" There ! "
60833	60860	60830	60830	she	48	" It has come ! I know now ! I must look among the things in the old trunk I had when I was a princess . "
61010	61016	61017	61017	she	48	" These are the plates , "
61020	61041	61017	61017	she	48	" They are golden plates . These are the richly embroidered napkins . Nuns worked them in convents in Spain . "
61042	61048	61050	61050	Becky	48	" Did they , miss ? "
61060	61066	61068	61068	Sara	18	" You must pretend it , "
61070	61082	61068	61068	Sara	18	" If you pretend it enough , you will see them . "
61083	61088	61090	61090	Becky	48	" Yes , miss , "
61169	61177	61178	61178	Sara	18	" What is the matter , Becky ? "
61181	61187	61178	61178	Sara	18	" What are you doing ? "
61196	61205	61206	61206	she	48	" I was a-'pretendin ' , ' miss , "
61212	61228	61206	61206	she	48	" I was tryin ' to see it like you do . I almost did , "
61234	61244	61206	61206	she	48	" But it takes a lot o ' stren't h. "
61245	61257	61259	61259	Sara	18	" Perhaps it does if you are not used to it , "
61265	61314	61259	61259	Sara	18	" but you do n't know how easy it is when you 've done it often . I would n't try so hard just at first . It will come to you after a while . I 'll just tell you what things are . Look at these . "
61351	61359	61360	61360	she	48	" These are garlands for the feast , "
61364	61395	61360	61360	she	48	" They fill all the air with perfume . There 's a mug on the wash - stand , Becky . Oh and bring the soap dish for a centerpiece . "
61403	61411	61412	61412	she	48	" What are they now , miss ? "
61415	61431	61412	61412	she	48	" You 'd think they was made of crockery but I know they ai n't . "
61432	61439	61441	61441	Sara	18	" This is a carven flagon , "
61452	61455	61441	61441	Sara	18	" And this "
61467	61475	61476	61476	She	48	" is purest alabaster encrusted with gems . "
61503	61511	61513	61513	Becky	48	" My , ai n't it lovely ! "
61515	61525	61526	61526	Sara	18	" If we just had something for bonbon dishes , "
61529	61532	61526	61526	Sara	18	" There ! "
61539	61548	61526	61526	Sara	18	" I remember I saw something this minute . "
61649	61654	61655	61655	she	48	" This ' ere , "
61664	61678	61655	61655	she	48	" is it the Bastille now or has it turned into somethin' different ? "
61679	61686	61688	61688	Sara	18	" Oh , yes , yes ! "
61690	61700	61655	61655	she	48	" Quite different . It is a banquet hall ! "
61701	61707	61709	61709	Becky	48	" My eye , miss ! "
61711	61717	61719	61719	she	48	" A blanket ' all ! "
61731	61736	61738	61738	Sara	18	" A banquet hall , "
61740	61783	61738	61738	Sara	18	" A vast chamber where feasts are given . It has a vaulted roof , and a minstrels ' gallery , and a huge chimney filled with blazing oaken logs , and it is brilliant with waxen tapers twinkling on every side . "
61784	61791	61793	61793	Becky	48	" My eye , Miss Sara ! "
61869	61874	61875	61875	she	40	" Oh , Sara ! "
61879	61889	61875	61875	she	40	" You are the cleverest girl I ever saw ! "
61890	61896	61898	61898	Sara	18	" Is n't it nice ? "
61900	61924	61898	61898	Sara	18	" They are things out of my old trunk . I asked my Magic , and it told me to go and look . "
61925	61931	61933	61933	Becky	48	" But oh , miss , "
61935	61958	61933	61933	Becky	48	" wait till she 's told you what they are ! They ai n't just oh , miss , please tell her , "
62022	62030	62032	62032	Ermengarde	40	" It 's like a real party ! "
62034	62043	62045	62045	Becky	48	" It 's like a queen 's table , "
62055	62064	62065	62065	she	40	" I 'll tell you what , Sara , "
62068	62082	62065	62065	she	40	" Pretend you are a princess now and this is a royal feast . "
62083	62090	62092	62092	Sara	18	" But it 's your feast , "
62094	62110	62092	62092	Sara	18	" you must be the princess , and we will be your maids of honor . "
62111	62118	62120	62120	Ermengarde	40	" Oh , I ca n't , "
62122	62139	62120	62120	Ermengarde	40	" I 'm too fat , and I do n't know how . YOU be her . "
62140	62149	62151	62151	Sara	18	" Well , if you want me to , "
62167	62180	62181	62181	she	18	" There is a lot of paper and rubbish stuffed in here ! "
62184	62213	62214	62214	She	18	" If we light it , there will be a bright blaze for a few minutes , and we shall feel as if it was a real fire . "
62232	62240	62241	62241	Sara	18	" By the time it stops blazing , "
62244	62254	62241	62241	Sara	18	" we shall forget about its not being real . "
62264	62271	62272	62272	she	18	" Does n't it LOOK real ? "
62275	62283	62272	62272	she	18	" Now we will begin the party . "
62311	62317	62318	62318	she	18	" Advance , fair damsels , "
62327	62358	62318	62318	she	18	" and be seated at the banquet table . My noble father , the king , who is absent on a long journey , has commanded me to feast you . "
62371	62390	62391	62391	she	18	" What , ho , there , minstrels ! Strike up with your viols and bassoons . Princesses , "
62399	62426	62391	62391	she	18	" always had minstrels to play at their feasts . Pretend there is a minstrel gallery up there in the corner . Now we will begin . "
62503	62509	62511	62511	Becky	48	" It 's the missus ! "
62523	62526	62528	62528	Sara	18	" Yes , "
62542	62550	62528	62528	Sara	18	" Miss Minchin has found us out . "
62603	62613	62614	62614	she	22	" I have been suspecting something of this sort , "
62617	62633	62614	62614	she	22	" but I did not dream of such audacity . Lavinia was telling the truth . "
62667	62672	62673	62673	she	22	" You impudent creature ! "
62676	62685	62673	62673	she	22	" You leave the house in the morning ! "
62705	62714	62715	62715	she	22	" Oh , do n't send her away , "
62718	62733	62715	62715	she	22	" My aunt sent me the hamper . We 're only having a party . "
62734	62739	62741	62742	Miss Minchin	22	" So I see , "
62746	62758	62741	62742	Miss Minchin	22	" With the Princess Sara at the head of the table . "
62765	62774	62775	62775	she	22	" It is your doing , I know , "
62778	62800	62801	62801	She	22	" Ermengarde would never have thought of such a thing . You decorated the table , I suppose with this rubbish . "
62808	62814	62815	62815	she	22	" Go to your attic ! "
62842	62861	62815	62815	she	22	" I will attend to you tomorrow . You shall have neither breakfast , dinner , nor supper ! "
62862	62876	62878	62878	Sara	18	" I have not had either dinner or supper today , Miss Minchin , "
62883	62909	62815	62815	she	22	" Then all the better . You will have something to remember . Do n't stand there . Put those things into the hamper again . "
62932	62935	62937	62937	Ermengarde	40	" And you "
62938	62987	62937	62937	Ermengarde	40	" have brought your beautiful new books into this dirty attic . Take them up and go back to bed . You will stay there all day tomorrow , and I shall write to your papa . What would HE say if he knew where you are tonight ? "
63008	63015	63016	63016	she	18	" What are you thinking of ? "
63019	63029	63016	63016	she	18	" Why do you look at me like that ? "
63030	63035	63040	63040	she	18	" I was wondering , "
63050	63056	63040	63040	she	18	" What were you wondering ? "
63083	63088	63089	63089	she	18	" I was wondering , "
63096	63110	63089	63089	she	18	" what MY papa would say if he knew where I am tonight . "
63143	63150	63151	63151	she	22	" You insolent , unmanageable child ! "
63154	63163	63151	63151	she	22	" How dare you ! How dare you ! "
63201	63209	63210	63210	she	22	" I will leave you to wonder , "
63213	63220	63222	63222	she	22	" Go to bed this instant . "
63353	63363	63364	63364	she	22	" There is n't any banquet left , Emily , "
63367	63386	63364	63364	she	22	" And there is n't any princess . There is nothing left but the prisoners in the Bastille . "
63542	63554	63555	63555	she	27	" I ca n't pretend anything else while I am awake , "
63558	63584	63555	63555	she	27	" There would n't be any use in trying . If I go to sleep , perhaps a dream will come and pretend for me . "
63608	63626	63627	63627	she	27	" Suppose there was a bright fire in the grate , with lots of little dancing flames , "
63630	63659	63661	63661	she	27	" Suppose there was a comfortable chair before it and suppose there was a small table near , with a little hot hot supper on it . And suppose "
63687	63706	63661	63661	she	27	" And her very weariness was good to her , for her eyes closed and she fell fast asleep .
63918	63924	63925	63925	she	27	" What a nice dream ! "
63928	63942	63925	63925	she	27	" I feel quite warm . I do n't want to wake up . "
64055	64062	64063	64063	she	27	" Oh , I am awakening , "
64067	64077	64063	64063	she	27	" I ca n't help it I ca n't . "
64111	64118	64119	64119	she	27	" Oh , I HAVEN'T awakened , "
64134	64140	64119	64119	she	27	" I am dreaming yet . "
64350	64357	64358	64358	she	27	" It does not melt away , "
64361	64372	64358	64358	she	27	" Oh , I never had such a dream before . "
64400	64411	64414	64414	her	27	" I am dreaming I am getting out of bed , "
64439	64470	64471	64471	Her	27	" I am dreaming it stays real ! I 'm dreaming it FEELS real . It 's bewitched or I 'm bewitched . I only THINK I see it all . "
64478	64488	64489	64489	she	27	" If I can only keep on thinking it , "
64492	64503	64489	64489	she	27	" I do n't care ! I do n't care ! "
64517	64525	64526	64526	she	27	" Oh , it is n't true ! "
64529	64543	64526	64526	she	27	" It CAN'T be true ! But oh , how true it seems ! "
64574	64585	64586	64586	she	27	" A fire I only dreamed would n't be HOT , "
64637	64646	64647	64647	she	27	" It 's warm . It 's soft ! "
64651	64660	64647	64647	she	27	" It 's real . It must be ! "
64676	64688	64689	64689	she	27	" They are real , too . It 's all real ! "
64692	64701	64689	64689	she	27	" I am NOT I am NOT dreaming ! "
64734	64747	64749	64749	she	27	" To the little girl in the attic . From a friend . "
64775	64784	64785	64785	she	27	" I do n't know who it is , "
64788	64802	64785	64785	she	27	" but somebody cares for me a little . I have a friend . "
64825	64830	64831	64831	she	27	" Becky , Becky ! "
64839	64843	64831	64831	she	27	" Wake up ! "
64910	64913	64914	64914	she	18	" Come , "
64917	64924	64914	64914	she	18	" Oh , Becky , come ! "
64986	64995	64996	64996	she	18	" It 's true ! It 's true ! "
64999	65041	64996	64996	she	18	" I 've touched them all . They are as real as we are . The Magic has come and done it , Becky , while we were asleep the Magic that wo n't let those worst things EVER quite happen . "
65227	65242	65243	65243	she	18	" I do n't know anyone in the world who could have done it , "
65246	65285	65243	65243	she	18	" but there has been someone . And here we are sitting by their fire and and it 's true ! And whoever it is wherever they are I have a friend , Becky someone is my friend . "
65328	65333	65334	65334	Becky	48	" Do you think , "
65342	65360	65334	65334	Becky	48	" do you think it could melt away , miss ? Had n't we better be quick ? "
65384	65393	65395	65395	Sara	18	" No , it wo n't melt away , "
65397	65450	65395	65395	Sara	18	" I am EATING this muffin , and I can taste it . You never really eat things in dreams . You only think you are going to eat them . Besides , I keep giving myself pinches ; and I touched a hot piece of coal just now , on purpose . "
65554	65567	65568	65568	she	48	" If it ai n't here in the mornin ' , miss , "
65571	65589	65590	65590	She	48	" it 's been here tonight , anyways , an ' I sha n't never forget it . "
65605	65610	65614	65614	her	48	" The fire was THERE "
65617	65670	65671	65671	she	48	" an ' the table was before it ; an ' the lamp was there , an ' the light looked rosy red ; an ' there was a satin cover on your bed , an ' a warm rug on the floor , an ' everythin ' looked beautiful ; an ' "
65684	65697	65671	65671	she	48	" there WAS soup an ' sandwiches an ' muffins there WAS . "
65833	65847	65849	65849	Jessie	33	" She 's growing so fast and learning such a lot , somehow , "
65853	65900	65849	65849	Jessie	33	" that she will be given classes soon , and Miss Minchin knows she will have to work for nothing . It was rather nasty of you , Lavvy , to tell about her having fun in the garret . How did you find it out ? "
65901	65940	65830	65830	her	22	" I got it out of Lottie . She 's such a baby she did n't know she was telling me . There was nothing nasty at all in speaking to Miss Minchin . I felt it my duty "
65943	65973	65830	65830	her	22	" She was being deceitful . And it 's ridiculous that she should look so grand , and be made so much of , in her rags and tatters ! "
65974	65985	65849	65849	Jessie	33	" What were they doing when Miss Minchin caught them ? "
65986	66052	65830	65830	her	22	" Pretending some silly thing . Ermengarde had taken up her hamper to share with Sara and Becky . She never invites us to share things . Not that I care , but it 's rather vulgar of her to share with servant girls in attics . I wonder Miss Minchin did n't turn Sara out even if she does want her for a teacher . "
66053	66064	66066	66066	Jessie	33	" If she was turned out where would she go ? "
66072	66078	66080	66080	Lavinia	30	" How do I know ? "
66082	66120	66080	66080	Lavinia	30	" She 'll look rather queer when she comes into the schoolroom this morning , I should think after what 's happened . She had no dinner yesterday , and she 's not to have any today . "
66143	66152	66153	66153	she	33	" Well , I think it 's horrid , "
66156	66167	66153	66153	she	33	" They 've no right to starve her to death . "
66264	66276	66277	66277	she	48	" It was there when I wakened , miss the blanket , "
66281	66292	66277	66277	she	48	" It was as real as it was last night . "
66293	66298	66300	66300	Sara	18	" So was mine , "
66302	66326	66300	66300	Sara	18	" It is all there now all of it . While I was dressing I ate some of the cold things we left . "
66327	66336	66337	66337	Becky	48	" Oh , laws ! Oh , laws ! "
66619	66634	66635	66635	she	22	" You do not look as if you realize that you are in disgrace , "
66638	66644	66635	66635	she	22	" Are you absolutely hardened ? "
66753	66762	66763	66763	she	22	" I beg your pardon , Miss Minchin , "
66766	66775	66763	66763	she	22	" I know that I am in disgrace . "
66776	66810	66746	66746	she	22	" Be good enough not to forget it and look as if you had come into a fortune . It is an impertinence . And remember you are to have no food today . "
66811	66817	66818	66818	Sara	18	" Yes , Miss Minchin , "
66838	66850	66851	66851	she	22	" If the Magic had not saved me just in time , "
66854	66862	66851	66851	she	22	" how horrible it would have been ! "
66863	66871	66873	66873	Lavinia	30	" She ca n't be very hungry , "
66875	66891	66873	66873	Lavinia	30	" Just look at her . Perhaps she is pretending she has had a good breakfast "
66897	66905	66907	66907	Jessie	33	" She 's different from other people , "
66915	66925	66907	66907	Jessie	33	" Sometimes I 'm a bit frightened of her . "
66926	66930	66932	66932	Lavinia	30	" Ridiculous thing ! "
67158	67163	67164	67164	Sara	18	" But whatever happens , "
67171	67223	67168	67168	herself	18	" WHATEVER happens , somewhere in the world there is a heavenly kind person who is my friend my friend . If I never know who it is if I never can even thank him I shall never feel quite so lonely . Oh , the Magic was GOOD to me ! "
67432	67443	67444	67444	she	18	" Of course it MIGHT all have been taken away , "
67452	67482	67444	67444	she	18	" It might only have been lent to me for just that one awful night . But it WAS lent to me I had it . It was real . "
67748	67758	67759	67759	she	18	" It is exactly like something fairy come true , "
67762	67872	67759	67759	she	18	" There is n't the least difference . I feel as if I might wish for anything diamonds or bags of gold and they would appear ! THAT would n't be any stranger than this . Is this my garret ? Am I the same cold , ragged , damp Sara ? And to think I used to pretend and pretend and wish there were fairies ! The one thing I always wanted was to see a fairy story come true . I am LIVING in a fairy story . I feel as if I might be a fairy myself , and able to turn things into anything else . "
67916	67921	67922	67922	she	2744	" Oh , laws ! "
67925	67932	67922	67922	she	2744	" Oh , laws , miss ! "
67933	67937	67939	67939	Sara	18	" You see , "
68012	68020	68021	68021	Becky	48	" Where does it all come from ? "
68026	68035	68021	68021	Becky	48	" Laws , who does it , miss ? "
68036	68044	68046	68046	Sara	18	" Do n't let us even ASK , "
68048	68078	68046	68046	Sara	18	" If it were not that I want to say , ' Oh , thank you , ' I would rather not know . It makes it more beautiful . "
68359	68365	68366	68366	she	18	" If you only knew ! "
68372	68378	68366	68366	she	18	" If you only knew ! "
68496	68503	68504	68505	Miss Minchin	22	" Sara Crewe looks wonderfully well , "
68512	68515	68517	68521	poor , silly Miss Amelia	22	" Yes , "
68523	68540	68517	68521	poor , silly Miss Amelia	22	" She is absolutely fattening . She was beginning to look like a little starved crow . "
68541	68544	68546	68547	Miss Minchin	22	" Starved ! "
68551	68569	68546	68547	Miss Minchin	22	" There was no reason why she should look starved . She always had plenty to eat ! "
68570	68575	68577	68578	Miss Amelia	22	" Of of course , "
68597	68616	68618	68619	Miss Minchin	22	" There is something very disagreeable in seeing that sort of thing in a child of her age , "
68625	68631	68632	68633	Miss Amelia	22	" What sort of thing ? "
68636	68644	68646	68647	Miss Minchin	22	" It might almost be called defiance , "
68675	68722	68664	68664	she	22	" The spirit and will of any other child would have been entirely humbled and broken by by the changes she has had to submit to . But , upon my word , she seems as little subdued as if as if she were a princess . "
68723	68728	68733	68734	Miss Amelia	22	" Do you remember , "
68736	68759	68733	68734	Miss Amelia	22	" what she said to you that day in the schoolroom about what you would do if you found out that she was "
68760	68767	68769	68770	Miss Minchin	22	" No , I do n't , "
68772	68778	68769	68770	Miss Minchin	22	" Do n't talk nonsense . "
68946	68958	68928	68929	A man	2166	" To the Little Girl in the right - hand attic . "
69001	69014	69015	69015	she	22	" Take the things to the young lady to whom they belong , "
69019	69027	69015	69015	she	22	" Do n't stand there staring at them .
69028	69034	69036	69036	Sara	18	" They belong to me , "
69040	69044	69046	69047	Miss Minchin	22	" To you ? "
69049	69055	69046	69047	Miss Minchin	22	" What do you mean ? "
69056	69066	69068	69068	Sara	18	" I do n't know where they come from , "
69070	69093	69068	69068	Sara	18	" but they are addressed to me . I sleep in the right - hand attic . Becky has the other one . "
69110	69116	69117	69117	she	22	" What is in them ? "
69120	69126	69128	69128	Sara	18	" I do n't know , "
69130	69134	69135	69135	she	22	" Open them , "
69224	69239	69240	69241	Miss Minchin	22	" To be worn every day . Will be replaced by others when necessary . "
69428	69431	69432	69432	she	22	" Well , "
69520	69520	69550	69550	Jessie	33	"
69544	69548	69550	69550	Jessie	33	" My word ! "
69557	69564	69550	69550	Jessie	33	" Look at the Princess Sara ! "
69705	69714	69715	69715	Jessie	33	" Perhaps someone has left her a fortune , "
69718	69733	69715	69715	Jessie	33	" I always thought something would happen to her . She 's so queer . "
69734	69744	69746	69746	Lavinia	30	" Perhaps the diamond mines have suddenly appeared again , "
69750	69767	69746	69746	Lavinia	30	" Do n't please her by staring at her in that way , you silly thing . "
69768	69771	69774	69775	Miss Minchin	22	" Sara , "
69780	69786	69774	69775	Miss Minchin	22	" come and sit here . "
69857	69869	69870	69870	Becky	48	" Are you making something up in your head , miss ? "
69913	69916	69917	69917	she	18	" No , "
69920	69930	69908	69908	she	18	" I am wondering what I ought to do . "
69950	69960	69961	69961	Sara	18	" I ca n't help thinking about my friend , "
69964	70038	69961	69961	Sara	18	" If he wants to keep himself a secret , it would be rude to try and find out who he is . But I do so want him to know how thankful I am to him and how happy he has made me . Anyone who is kind wants to know when people have been made happy . They care for that more than for being thanked . I wish I do wish "
70096	70099	70100	70100	she	18	" Oh , "
70103	70113	70100	70100	she	18	" why did I not think of that before ? "
70130	70137	70138	70138	she	18	" I can write to him , "
70142	70184	70138	70138	she	18	" and leave it on the table . Then perhaps the person who takes the things away will take it , too . I wo n't ask him anything . He wo n't mind my thanking him , I feel sure . "
70465	70472	70473	70473	she	114	" Something 's there , miss , "
70476	70479	70481	70481	Sara	18	" Yes , "
70485	70497	70481	70481	Sara	18	" It sounds rather like a cat trying to get in . "
70568	70571	70572	70572	she	114	" Suppose , "
70577	70596	70572	70572	she	114	" just suppose it was the monkey who got away again . Oh , I wish it was ! "
70648	70654	70655	70655	she	114	" It is the monkey , "
70659	70676	70655	70655	she	114	" He has crept out of the Lascar 's attic , and he saw the light . "
70683	70694	70695	70695	she	48	" Are you going to let him in , miss ? "
70698	70701	70702	70702	Sara	18	" Yes , "
70706	70727	70702	70702	Sara	18	" It 's too cold for monkeys to be out . They 're delicate . I 'll coax him in . "
70759	70766	70767	70767	she	114	" Come along , monkey darling , "
70770	70777	70767	70767	she	114	" I wo n't hurt you . "
70857	70864	70865	70865	she	114	" Nice monkey ! Nice monkey ! "
70873	70883	70865	70865	she	114	" Oh , I do love little animal things . "
70917	70930	70932	70932	Becky	48	" He IS plain - looking , miss , ai n't he ? "
70934	70943	70945	70945	Sara	18	" He looks like a very ugly baby , "
70947	70995	70945	70945	Sara	18	" I beg your pardon , monkey ; but I 'm glad you are not a baby . Your mother COULDN'T be proud of you , and no one would dare to say you looked like any of your relations . Oh , I do like you ! "
71005	71015	71016	71016	she	18	" Perhaps he 's sorry he 's so ugly , "
71019	71046	71016	71016	she	18	" and it 's always on his mind . I wonder if he HAS a mind . Monkey , my love , have you a mind ? "
71061	71069	71070	71070	Becky	48	" What shall you do with him ? "
71073	71127	71134	71134	she	48	" I shall let him sleep with me tonight , and then take him back to the Indian gentleman tomorrow . I am sorry to take you back , monkey ; but you must go . You ought to be fondest of your own family ; and I 'm not a REAL relation . "
71164	71170	71189	71189	their	1589	" It Is the Child ! "
71396	71405	71406	71406	Janet	83	" Do n't chirrup so loud , Donald , "
71409	71442	71406	71406	Janet	83	" When you come to cheer an ill person up you do n't cheer him up at the top of your voice . Perhaps cheering up is too loud , Mr. Carrisford ? "
71456	71463	71464	71464	he	96	" No , it is n't , "
71467	71477	71464	71464	he	96	" And it keeps me from thinking too much . "
71478	71486	71487	71487	Donald	85	" I 'm going to be quiet , "
71490	71500	71487	71487	Donald	85	" We 'll all be as quiet as mice . "
71501	71511	71513	71513	Janet	83	" Mice do n't make a noise like that , "
71533	71541	71542	71542	he	85	" A whole lot of mice might , "
71546	71552	71542	71542	he	85	" A thousand mice might . "
71553	71563	71565	71565	Janet	83	" I do n't believe fifty thousand mice would , "
71569	71581	71565	71565	Janet	83	" and we have to be as quiet as one mouse . "
71591	71600	71601	71601	she	83	" Papa wo n't be very long now , "
71604	71614	71601	71601	she	83	" May we talk about the lost little girl ? "
71615	71630	71631	71633	the Indian gentleman	930	" I do n't think I could talk much about anything else just now , "
71644	71651	71653	71653	Nora	84	" We like her so much , "
71655	71666	71653	71653	Nora	84	" We call her the little un - fairy princess . "
71667	71670	71671	71673	the Indian gentleman	930	" Why ? "
71697	71747	71693	71693	Janet	83	" It is because , though she is not exactly a fairy , she will be so rich when she is found that she will be like a princess in a fairy tale . We called her the fairy princess at first , but it did n't quite suit . "
71748	71753	71755	71755	Nora	84	" Is it true , "
71757	71802	71755	71755	Nora	84	" that her papa gave all his money to a friend to put in a mine that had diamonds in it , and then the friend thought he had lost it all and ran away because he felt as if he was a robber ? "
71803	71813	71816	71816	Janet	83	" But he was n't really , you know , "
71830	71838	71839	71839	he	930	" No , he was n't really , "
71842	71850	71851	71851	Janet	83	" I am sorry for the friend , "
71854	71885	71851	71851	Janet	83	" I ca n't help it . He did n't mean to do it , and it would break his heart . I am sure it would break his heart . "
71886	71896	71903	71903	he	930	" You are an understanding little woman , Janet , "
71909	71916	71917	71917	Donald	85	" Did you tell Mr. Carrisford , "
71921	71957	71917	71917	Donald	85	" about the little - girl - who - isn't -a - beggar ? Did you tell him she has new nice clothes ? P'r'aps she 's been found by somebody when she was lost . "
71958	71964	71966	71966	Janet	83	" There 's a cab ! "
71968	71980	71966	71966	Janet	83	" It 's stopping before the door . It is papa ! "
71991	71998	71999	71999	Donald	85	" Yes , it 's papa , "
72002	72010	71999	71999	Donald	85	" But there is no little girl . "
72070	72076	72077	72077	he	96	" It is no use , "
72080	72087	72077	72077	he	96	" What a wreck I am ! "
72096	72101	72102	72102	he	97	" No , children , "
72106	72126	72102	72102	he	97	" you may come in after I have talked to Mr. Carrisford . Go and play with Ram Dass . "
72179	72183	72184	72185	Mr. Carrisford	96	" What news ? "
72188	72196	72184	72185	Mr. Carrisford	96	" The child the Russian people adopted ? "
72197	72208	72210	72211	Mr. Carmichael	97	" She is not the child we are looking for , "
72215	72251	72210	72211	Mr. Carmichael	97	" She is much younger than Captain Crewe 's little girl . Her name is Emily Carew . I have seen and talked to her . The Russians were able to give me every detail . "
72269	72280	72281	72281	he	97	" Then the search has to be begun over again , "
72284	72293	72281	72281	he	97	" That is all . Please sit down . "
72399	72404	72405	72405	he	97	" Come , come , "
72412	72419	72405	72405	he	97	" we 'll find her yet . "
72420	72433	72434	72435	Mr. Carrisford	96	" We must begin at once . No time must be lost , "
72438	72449	72434	72435	Mr. Carrisford	96	" Have you any new suggestion to make any whatsoever ? "
72473	72478	72479	72479	he	97	" Well , perhaps , "
72482	72518	72479	72479	he	97	" I do n't know what it may be worth . The fact is , an idea occurred to me as I was thinking the thing over in the train on the journey from Dover . "
72519	72533	72434	72435	Mr. Carrisford	96	" What was it ? If she is alive , she is somewhere . "
72534	72567	72479	72479	he	97	" Yes ; she is SOMEWHERE . We have searched the schools in Paris . Let us give up Paris and begin in London . That was my idea to search London . "
72568	72576	72578	72579	Mr. Carrisford	96	" There are schools enough in London , "
72591	72602	72582	72582	he	96	" By the way , there is one next door . "
72603	72619	72479	72479	he	97	" Then we will begin there . We can not begin nearer than next door . "
72620	72623	72625	72625	Carrisford	96	" No , "
72627	72664	72625	72625	Carrisford	96	" There is a child there who interests me ; but she is not a pupil . And she is a little dark , forlorn creature , as unlike poor Crewe as a child could be . "
72723	72726	72727	72727	he	1137	" Sahib , "
72730	72785	72727	72727	he	1137	" the child herself has come the child the sahib felt pity for . She brings back the monkey who had again run away to her attic under the roof . I have asked that she remain . It was my thought that it would please the sahib to see and speak with her . "
72786	72791	72793	72794	Mr. Carmichael	97	" Who is she ? "
72796	72800	72801	72802	Mr. Carrrisford	117	" God knows , "
72805	72821	72822	72822	He	117	" She is the child I spoke of . A little drudge at the school . "
72834	72850	72852	72852	he	117	" Yes , I should like to see her . Go and bring her in . "
72858	72865	72866	72866	he	117	" While you have been away , "
72869	72949	72866	72866	he	117	" I have been desperate . The days were so dark and long . Ram Dass told me of this child 's miseries , and together we invented a romantic plan to help her . I suppose it was a childish thing to do ; but it gave me something to plan and think of . Without the help of an agile , soft - footed Oriental like Ram Dass , however , it could not have been done . "
73012	73019	73020	73020	she	18	" Your monkey ran away again , "
73028	73076	73020	73020	she	18	" He came to my garret window last night , and I took him in because it was so cold . I would have brought him back if it had not been so late . I knew you were ill and might not like to be disturbed . "
73090	73098	73099	73099	he	930	" That was very thoughtful of you , "
73114	73123	73124	73124	she	18	" Shall I give him to the Lascar ? "
73127	73137	73139	73141	the Indian gentleman	930	" How do you know he is a Lascar ? "
73147	73154	73155	73155	Sara	18	" Oh , I know Lascars , "
73164	73171	73155	73155	Sara	18	" I was born in India . "
73197	73204	73205	73205	he	930	" You were born in India , "
73208	73215	73217	73217	he	930	" were you ? Come here . "
73266	73272	73273	73273	he	930	" You live next door ? "
73276	73287	73248	73248	her	18	" Yes ; I live at Miss Minchin 's seminary . "
73288	73298	73248	73248	her	18	" But you are not one of her pupils ? "
73314	73326	73327	73327	she	18	" I do n't think I know exactly WHAT I am , "
73330	73334	73248	73248	her	18	" Why not ? "
73335	73350	73248	73248	her	18	" At first I was a pupil , and a parlor boarder ; but now "
73351	73362	73248	73248	her	18	" You were a pupil ! What are you now ? "
73375	73388	73389	73389	she	18	" I sleep in the attic , next to the scullery maid , "
73392	73415	73389	73389	she	18	" I run errands for the cook I do anything she tells me ; and I teach the little ones their lessons . "
73416	73422	73424	73425	Mr. Carrisford	96	" Question her , Carmichael , "
73437	73445	73431	73431	he	96	" Question her ; I can not . "
73482	73496	73497	73497	he	1628	" What do you mean by ' At first , ' my child ? "
73500	73511	73467	73467	he	1628	" When I was first taken there by my papa . "
73512	73518	73467	73467	he	1628	" Where is your papa ? "
73519	73523	73525	73525	Sara	18	" He died , "
73530	73559	73525	73525	Sara	18	" He lost all his money and there was none left for me . There was no one to take care of me or to pay Miss Minchin . "
73560	73563	73564	73566	the Indian gentleman	930	" Carmichael ! "
73571	73574	73564	73566	the Indian gentleman	930	" Carmichael ! "
73575	73582	73583	73584	Mr. Carmichael	97	" We must not frighten her , "
73603	73629	73597	73597	he	97	" So you were sent up into the attic , and made into a little drudge . That was about it , was n't it ? "
73630	73641	73643	73643	Sara	18	" There was no one to take care of me , "
73645	73656	73643	73643	Sara	18	" There was no money ; I belong to nobody . "
73657	73666	73667	73669	the Indian gentleman	930	" How did your father lose his money ? "
73674	73682	73683	73683	Sara	18	" He did not lose it himself , "
73692	73725	73683	73683	Sara	18	" He had a friend he was very fond of he was very fond of him . It was his friend who took his money . He trusted his friend too much . "
73735	73746	73747	73747	he	930	" The friend might have MEANT to do no harm , "
73750	73759	73747	73747	he	930	" It might have happened through a mistake . "
73795	73806	73807	73807	she	18	" The suffering was just as bad for my papa , "
73810	73815	73807	73807	she	18	" It killed him . "
73816	73824	73825	73827	the Indian gentleman	930	" What was your father 's name ? "
73830	73834	73825	73827	the Indian gentleman	930	" Tell me . "
73835	73842	73843	73843	Sara	18	" His name was Ralph Crewe , "
73849	73858	73843	73843	Sara	18	" Captain Crewe . He died in India . "
73874	73877	73878	73879	the invalid	1610	" Carmichael , "
73882	73890	73878	73879	the invalid	1610	" it is the child the child ! "
73936	73942	73943	73943	she	18	" What child am I ? "
73946	73954	73958	73958	her	18	" He was your father 's friend , "
73960	73976	73955	73956	Mr. Carmichael	97	" Do n't be frightened . We have been looking for you for two years . "
74001	74013	74014	74014	she	18	" And I was at Miss Minchin 's all the while , "
74018	74028	74014	74014	she	18	" Just on the other side of the wall . "
74030	74036	73991	73991	She	18	" I Tried Not to Be "
74097	74102	74103	74103	he	96	" Upon my word , "
74124	74139	74103	74103	he	96	" I feel as if I do not want to lose sight of her . "
74140	74148	74149	74149	Janet	83	" I will take care of her , "
74152	74162	74149	74149	Janet	83	" and mamma will come in a few minutes . "
74172	74181	74182	74182	she	83	" We 're so glad you are found , "
74185	74199	74182	74182	she	83	" You do n't know how glad we are that you are found . "
74221	74238	74239	74239	he	85	" If I 'd just asked what your name was when I gave you my sixpence , "
74242	74264	74239	74239	he	85	" you would have told me it was Sara Crewe , and then you would have been found in a minute . "
74288	74296	74297	74297	she	118	" You look bewildered , poor child , "
74300	74310	74297	74297	she	118	" And it is not to be wondered at . "
74319	74323	74324	74324	she	118	" Was he , "
74337	74350	74324	74324	she	118	" was HE the wicked friend ? Oh , do tell me ! "
74382	74391	74392	74392	she	118	" He was not wicked , my dear , "
74395	74459	74392	74392	she	118	" He did not really lose your papa 's money . He only thought he had lost it ; and because he loved him so much his grief made him so ill that for a time he was not in his right mind . He almost died of brain fever , and long before he began to recover your poor papa was dead . "
74460	74471	74473	74473	Sara	18	" And he did not know where to find me , "
74475	74482	74473	74473	Sara	18	" And I was so near . "
74496	74506	74507	74508	Mrs. Carmichael	118	" He believed you were in school in France , "
74511	74595	74507	74508	Mrs. Carmichael	118	" And he was continually misled by false clues . He has looked for you everywhere . When he saw you pass by , looking so sad and neglected , he did not dream that you were his friend 's poor child ; but because you were a little girl , too , he was sorry for you , and wanted to make you happier . And he told Ram Dass to climb into your attic window and try to make you comfortable . "
74608	74616	74617	74617	she	18	" Did Ram Dass bring the things ? "
74621	74640	74617	74617	she	18	" Did he tell Ram Dass to do it ? Did he make the dream that came true ? "
74641	74669	74675	74676	Mr. Carmichael	97	" Yes , my dear yes ! He is kind and good , and he was sorry for you , for little lost Sara Crewe 's sake . "
74687	74694	74695	74695	he	97	" Mr. Carrisford is better already , "
74698	74707	74695	74695	he	97	" He wants you to come to him . "
74750	74758	74759	74759	she	18	" You sent the things to me , "
74769	74780	74759	74759	she	18	" the beautiful , beautiful things ? YOU sent them ! "
74781	74792	74793	74793	he	930	" Yes , poor , dear child , I did , "
74866	74876	74877	74877	she	18	" Then it is you who are my friend , "
74880	74889	74877	74877	she	18	" it is you who are my friend ! "
74906	74917	74918	74919	Mr. Carmichael	97	" The man will be himself again in three weeks , "
74926	74933	74918	74919	Mr. Carmichael	97	" Look at his face already . "
74945	74949	74951	74951	he	930	" Little Missus , "
75032	75042	75044	75044	Sara	18	" I am glad I need not go back , "
75046	75073	75044	75044	Sara	18	" She will be very angry . She does not like me ; though perhaps it is my fault , because I do not like her . "
75155	75161	75163	75164	Miss Minchin	22	" What does she mean ! "
75169	75181	75183	75184	Miss Amelia	22	" I do n't know , I 'm sure , sister , "
75186	75201	75183	75184	Miss Amelia	22	" Unless she has made friends with him because he has lived in India . "
75202	75226	75228	75229	Miss Minchin	22	" It would be just like her to thrust herself upon him and try to gain his sympathies in some such impertinent fashion , "
75231	75265	75228	75229	Miss Minchin	22	" She must have been in the house for two hours . I will not allow such presumption . I shall go and inquire into the matter , and apologize for her intrusion . "
75358	75367	75368	75368	she	22	" I am sorry to disturb Mr. Carrisford , "
75371	75395	75368	75368	she	22	" but I have explanations to make . I am Miss Minchin , the proprietress of the Young Ladies ' Seminary next door . "
75436	75443	75444	75444	he	930	" So you are Miss Minchin ? "
75447	75453	75498	75499	Miss Minchin	22	" I am , sir . "
75454	75459	75460	75462	the Indian gentleman	930	" In that case , "
75465	75491	75460	75462	the Indian gentleman	930	" you have arrived at the right time . My solicitor , Mr. Carmichael , was just on the point of going to see you . "
75509	75513	75514	75514	she	22	" Your solicitor ! "
75517	75566	75567	75567	She	22	" I do not understand . I have come here as a matter of duty . I have just discovered that you have been intruded upon through the forwardness of one of my pupils a charity pupil . I came to explain that she intruded without my knowledge . "
75572	75578	75579	75579	she	22	" Go home at once , "
75583	75595	75579	75579	she	22	" You shall be severely punished . Go home at once . "
75609	75615	75596	75598	The Indian gentleman	930	" She is not going . "
75629	75633	75634	75634	she	22	" Not going ! "
75637	75640	75642	75643	Mr. Carrisford	96	" No , "
75645	75669	75642	75643	Mr. Carrisford	96	" She is not going home if you give your house that name . Her home for the future will be with me . "
75678	75691	75670	75671	Miss Minchin	22	" With YOU ! With YOU sir ! What does this mean ? "
75692	75700	75702	75704	the Indian gentleman	930	" Kindly explain the matter , Carmichael , "
75706	75716	75702	75704	the Indian gentleman	930	" and get it over as quickly as possible . "
75785	75791	75792	75792	he	930	" Mr. Carrisford , madam , "
75795	75837	75792	75792	he	930	" was an intimate friend of the late Captain Crewe . He was his partner in certain large investments . The fortune which Captain Crewe supposed he had lost has been recovered , and is now in Mr. Carrisford 's hands . "
75838	75842	75844	75845	Miss Minchin	22	" The fortune ! "
75858	75863	75848	75848	she	22	" Sara 's fortune ! "
75864	75872	75874	75875	Mr. Carmichael	97	" It WILL be Sara 's fortune , "
75880	75905	75874	75875	Mr. Carmichael	97	" It is Sara 's fortune now , in fact . Certain events have increased it enormously . The diamond mines have retrieved themselves . "
75906	75911	75912	75913	Miss Minchin	22	" The diamond mines ! "
75939	75944	75945	75946	Mr. Carmichael	97	" The diamond mines , "
75966	76016	75950	75950	he	97	" There are not many princesses , Miss Minchin , who are richer than your little charity pupil , Sara Crewe , will be . Mr. Carrisford has been searching for her for nearly two years ; he has found her at last , and he will keep her . "
76127	76135	76136	76136	she	22	" He found her under my care , "
76139	76158	76136	76136	she	22	" I have done everything for her . But for me she should have starved in the streets . "
76167	76175	76176	76176	he	930	" As to starving in the streets , "
76192	76192	76176	76176	he	930	"
76193	76202	76203	76204	Miss Minchin	22	" Captain Crewe left her in my charge , "
76207	76241	76203	76204	Miss Minchin	22	" She must return to it until she is of age . She can be a parlor boarder again . She must finish her education . The law will interfere in my behalf . "
76242	76250	76203	76204	Miss Minchin	22	" Come , come , Miss Minchin , "
76255	76292	76251	76252	Mr. Carmichael	97	" the law will do nothing of the sort . If Sara herself wishes to return to you , I dare say Mr. Carrisford might not refuse to allow it . But that rests with Sara . "
76293	76296	76298	76299	Miss Minchin	22	" Then , "
76301	76315	76316	76316	she	22	" I appeal to Sara . I have not spoiled you , perhaps , "
76324	76347	76316	76316	she	22	" but you know that your papa was pleased with your progress . And ahem I have always been fond of you . "
76369	76376	76377	76377	she	22	" Have YOU , Miss Minchin ? "
76380	76387	76377	76377	she	22	" I did not know that . "
76396	76404	76406	76406	she	22	" You ought to have known it , "
76408	76452	76406	76406	she	22	" but children , unfortunately , never know what is best for them . Amelia and I always said you were the cleverest child in the school . Will you not do your duty to your poor papa and come home with me ? "
76521	76536	76537	76537	she	18	" You know why I will not go home with you , Miss Minchin , "
76540	76546	76537	76537	she	18	" you know quite well . "
76561	76570	76571	76571	she	18	" You will never see your companions again , "
76574	76585	76571	76571	she	18	" I will see that Ermengarde and Lottie are kept away "
76594	76598	76599	76599	he	97	" Excuse me , "
76644	76644	76637	76638	Mr. Carrisford	96	"
76734	76743	76744	76744	she	34	" You have not undertaken an easy charge , "
76759	76777	76744	76744	she	34	" you will discover that very soon . The child is neither truthful nor grateful . I suppose "
76780	76792	76744	76744	she	34	" that you feel now that you are a princess again . "
76821	76830	76831	76831	she	34	" I TRIED not to be anything else , "
76837	76851	76831	76831	she	34	" even when I was coldest and hungriest I tried not to be . "
76852	76862	76864	76865	Miss Minchin	22	" Now it will not be necessary to try , "
76968	76979	76980	76980	she	22	" I 'm not as clever as you , sister , "
76983	77077	76980	76980	she	22	" and I am always afraid to say things to you for fear of making you angry . Perhaps if I were not so timid it would be better for the school and for both of us . I must say I 've often thought it would have been better if you had been less severe on Sara Crewe , and had seen that she was decently dressed and more comfortable . I KNOW she was worked too hard for a child of her age , and I know she was only half fed "
77078	77087	77089	77090	Miss Minchin	22	" How dare you say such a thing ! "
77092	77101	77102	77103	Miss Amelia	22	" I do n't know how I dare , "
77113	77189	77102	77103	Miss Amelia	22	" but now I 've begun I may as well finish , whatever happens to me . The child was a clever child and a good child and she would have paid you for any kindness you had shown her . But you did n't show her any . The fact was , she was too clever for you , and you always disliked her for that reason . She used to see through us both "
77190	77193	77202	77202	she	1699	" Amelia ! "
77238	77245	77246	77246	she	22	" She did ! She did ! "
77249	77332	77246	77246	she	22	" She saw through us both . She saw that you were a hard - hearted , worldly woman , and that I was a weak fool , and that we were both of us vulgar and mean enough to grovel on our knees for her money , and behave ill to her because it was taken from her though she behaved herself like a little princess even when she was a beggar . She did she did like a little princess ! "
77362	77370	77371	77371	she	1700	" And now you 've lost her , "
77375	77455	77371	77371	she	1700	" and some other school will get her and her money ; and if she were like any other child she 'd tell how she 's been treated , and all our pupils would be taken away and we should be ruined . And it serves us right ; but it serves you right more than it does me , for you are a hard woman , Maria Minchin , you 're a hard , selfish , worldly woman ! "
77637	77643	77645	77648	two or three voices	1708	" What IS the matter ? "
77652	77667	77669	77669	Lavinia	30	" Is it anything to do with the row that has been going on ? "
77673	77701	77669	77669	Lavinia	30	" There has been such a row in Miss Minchin 's room , Miss Amelia has had something like hysterics and has had to go to bed . "
77713	77723	77724	77724	she	40	" I have just had this letter from Sara , "
77741	77745	77708	77708	she	40	" From Sara ! "
77753	77758	77761	77761	Jessie	33	" Where is she ? "
77763	77767	77769	77769	Ermengarde	40	" Next door , "
77771	77777	77769	77769	Ermengarde	40	" with the Indian gentleman . "
77778	77811	77825	77825	Ermengarde	40	" Where ? Where ? Has she been sent away ? Does Miss Minchin know ? Was the row about that ? Why did she write ? Tell us ! Tell us ! "
77853	77859	77860	77860	she	40	" There WERE diamond mines , "
77864	77868	77860	77860	she	40	" there WERE ! "
77877	77882	77883	77883	she	40	" They were real , "
77887	77909	77883	77883	she	40	" It was all a mistake about them . Something happened for a time , and Mr. Carrisford thought they were ruined "
77910	77916	77918	77918	Jessie	33	" Who is Mr. Carrisford ? "
77920	78065	77883	77883	she	40	" The Indian gentleman . And Captain Crewe thought so , too and he died ; and Mr. Carrisford had brain fever and ran away , and HE almost died . And he did not know where Sara was . And it turned out that there were millions and millions of diamonds in the mines ; and half of them belong to Sara ; and they belonged to her when she was living in the attic with no one but Melchisedec for a friend , and the cook ordering her about . And Mr. Carrisford found her this afternoon , and he has got her in his home and she will never come back and she will be more a princess than she ever was a hundred and fifty thousand times more . And I am going to see her tomorrow afternoon . There ! "
78400	78405	78406	78406	he	89	" Missee sahib remembered , "
78409	78482	78406	78406	he	89	" She told the sahib all . She wished you to know the good fortune which has befallen her . Behold a letter on the tray . She has written . She did not wish that you should go to sleep unhappy . The sahib commands you to come to him tomorrow . You are to be the attendant of missee sahib . Tonight I take these things back over the roof . "
78774	78780	78781	78781	she	18	" That is my part , "
78784	78798	78781	78781	she	18	" Now wo n't you tell your part of it , Uncle Tom ? "
78807	78811	78802	78802	her	18	" Uncle Tom . "
78812	78827	78799	78799	He	930	" I do n't know your part yet , and it must be beautiful . "
79001	79004	79005	79005	he	89	" Sahib , "
79011	79053	79005	79005	he	89	" I could cross the slates and make the child a fire when she is out on some errand . When she returned , wet and cold , to find it blazing , she would think a magician had done it . "
79291	79297	79298	79298	Sara	18	" I am so glad , "
79301	79314	79298	79298	Sara	18	" I am so GLAD it was you who were my friend ! "
79517	79522	79537	79539	the Indian gentleman	930	" I am Boris , "
79526	79533	79537	79539	the Indian gentleman	930	" I serve the Princess Sara . "
79636	79646	79647	79647	he	96	" What are you ' supposing , ' Sara ? "
79662	79667	79668	79668	she	18	" I WAS supposing , "
79671	79685	79668	79668	she	18	" I was remembering that hungry day , and a child I saw . "
79686	79696	79698	79700	the Indian gentleman	930	" But there were a great many hungry days , "
79711	79718	79698	79700	the Indian gentleman	930	" Which hungry day was it ? "
79719	79727	79729	79729	Sara	18	" I forgot you did n't know , "
79731	79741	79729	79729	Sara	18	" It was the day the dream came true . "
79810	79820	79821	79821	she	18	" And I was supposing a kind of plan , "
79829	79840	79821	79821	she	18	" I was thinking I should like to do something . "
79841	79846	79848	79849	Mr. Carrisford	96	" What was it ? "
79856	79868	79848	79849	Mr. Carrisford	96	" You may do anything you like to do , princess . "
79869	79874	79877	79877	Sara	18	" I was wondering , "
79878	79957	79821	79821	she	18	" you know , you say I have so much money I was wondering if I could go to see the bun - woman , and tell her that if , when hungry children particularly on those dreadful days come and sit on the steps , or look in at the window , she would just call them in and give them something to eat , she might send the bills to me . Could I do that ? "
79958	79966	79968	79970	the Indian gentleman	930	" You shall do it tomorrow morning , "
79972	79976	79978	79978	Sara	18	" Thank you , "
79980	80007	79978	79978	Sara	18	" You see , I know what it is to be hungry , and it is very hard when one can not even PRETEND it away . "
80008	80016	80018	80020	the Indian gentleman	930	" Yes , yes , my dear , "
80022	80054	80018	80020	the Indian gentleman	930	" Yes , yes , it must be . Try to forget it . Come and sit on this footstool near my knee , and only remember you are a princess . "
80055	80058	80060	80060	Sara	18	" Yes , "
80064	80076	80060	80060	Sara	18	" and I can give buns and bread to the populace . "
80345	80356	80357	80357	she	1295	" I 'm sure that I remember you , miss , "
80360	80363	80357	80357	she	1295	" And yet "
80364	80367	80369	80369	Sara	18	" Yes , "
80371	80382	80369	80369	Sara	18	" once you gave me six buns for fourpence , and "
80383	80395	80396	80397	the woman	1295	" And you gave five of 'em to a beggar child , "
80403	80419	80420	80420	She	18	" I 've always remembered it . I could n't make it out at first . "
80435	80475	80420	80420	She	18	" I beg your pardon , sir , but there 's not many young people that notices a hungry face in that way ; and I 've thought of it many a time . Excuse the liberty , miss , "
80478	80492	80420	80420	She	18	" but you look rosier and well , better than you did that that "
80493	80501	80503	80503	Sara	18	" I am better , thank you , "
80505	80524	80503	80503	Sara	18	" And I am much happier and I have come to ask you to do something for me . "
80525	80530	80532	80535	the bun - woman	3045	" Me , miss ! "
80540	80555	80532	80535	the bun - woman	3045	" Why , bless you ! Yes , miss . What can I do ? "
80593	80599	80600	80600	she	18	" Why , bless me ! "
80610	80718	80600	80600	she	18	" it 'll be a pleasure to me to do it . I am a working - woman myself and can not afford to do much on my own account , and there 's sights of trouble on every side ; but , if you 'll excuse me , I 'm bound to say I 've given away many a bit of bread since that wet afternoon , just along o ' thinking of you an ' how wet an ' cold you was , an ' how hungry you looked ; an ' yet you gave away your hot buns as if you was a princess . "
80756	80762	80763	80763	she	18	" She looked so hungry , "
80766	80775	80763	80763	she	18	" She was even hungrier than I was . "
80776	80781	80783	80784	the woman	1295	" She was starving , "
80786	80822	80783	80784	the woman	1295	" Many 's the time she 's told me of it since how she sat there in the wet , and felt as if a wolf was a - tearing at her poor young insides . "
80823	80833	80835	80835	Sara	18	" Oh , have you seen her since then ? "
80837	80845	80835	80835	Sara	18	" Do you know where she is ? "
80846	80852	80854	80855	the woman	1295	" Yes , I do , "
80865	80931	80854	80855	the woman	1295	" Why , she 's in that there back room , miss , an ' has been for a month ; an ' a decent , well - meanin ' girl she 's goin' to turn out , an ' such a help to me in the shop an ' in the kitchen as you 'd scarce believe , knowin ' how she 's lived . "
81039	81043	81045	81046	the woman	1295	" You see , "
81048	81138	81045	81046	the woman	1295	" I told her to come when she was hungry , and when she 'd come I 'd give her odd jobs to do ; an ' I found she was willing , and somehow I got to like her ; and the end of it was , I 've given her a place an ' a home , and she helps me , an ' behaves well , an ' is as thankful as a girl can be . Her name 's Anne . She has no other . "
81185	81191	81192	81192	Sara	18	" I am so glad , "
81195	81242	81192	81192	Sara	18	" And I have just thought of something . Perhaps Mrs. Brown will let you be the one to give the buns and bread to the children . Perhaps you would like to do it because you know what it is to be hungry , too . "
81243	81248	81250	81251	the girl	1805	" Yes , miss , "
